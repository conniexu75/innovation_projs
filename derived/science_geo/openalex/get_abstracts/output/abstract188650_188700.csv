https://openalex.org/W2072942836,"We hypothesized that TRPV4, a member of the transient receptor family of ion channels, functions as a sensory transducer for osmotic stimulus-induced nociception. We found that, as expected for a transducer molecule, TRPV4 protein is transported in sensory nerve distally toward the peripheral nerve endings. In vivo single-fiber recordings in rat showed that hypotonic solution activated 54% of C-fibers, an effect enhanced by the hyperalgesic inflammatory mediator prostaglandin E2. This osmotransduction causes nociception, since administration of a small osmotic stimulus into skin sensitized by PGE2 produced pain-related behavior. Antisense-induced decrease in expression of TRPV4 confirmed that the channel is required for hypotonic stimulus-induced nociception. Thus, we conclude that TRPV4 can function as an osmo-transducer in primary afferent nociceptive nerve fibers. Because this action is enhanced by an inflammatory mediator, TRPV4 may be important in pathological states and may be an attractive pharmacological target for the development of novel analgesics."

https://openalex.org/W2070065061,"Stress increases addictive behaviors and is a common cause of relapse. Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) plays a key role in the modulation of drug taking by stress. However, the mechanism by which CRF modulates neuronal activity in circuits involved in drug addiction is poorly understood. Here we show that CRF induces a potentiation of NMDAR (N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor)-mediated synaptic transmission in dopamine neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA). This effect involves CRF receptor 2 (CRF-R2) and activation of the phospholipase C (PLC)-protein kinase C (PKC) pathway. We also find that this potentiation requires CRF binding protein (CRF-BP). Accordingly, CRF-like peptides, which do not bind the CRF-BP with high affinity, do not potentiate NMDARs. These results provide evidence of the first specific roles for CRF-R2 and CRF-BP in the modulation of neuronal activity and suggest that NMDARs in the VTA may be a target for both drugs of abuse and stress."
https://openalex.org/W2147313422,"1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) damages dopaminergic neurons as seen in Parkinson's disease. Although increasing evidence suggests an involvement of glia in MPTP neurotoxicity, the nature of this involvement remains unclear. Exploiting the advantage of cell culture systems, we demonstrated that microglia, but not astroglia, significantly enhanced the progression of MPTP-induced dopaminergic neurodegeneration. Characterization of the temporal relationship between neurodegeneration and microglial activation demonstrates that reactive microgliosis resulting from MPTP-initiated neuronal injury, but not direct activation, underlies the microglia-enhanced MPTP neurotoxicity. Mechanistically, through the release of NADPH oxidase-derived reactive oxygen species, microglia contribute to the progressive neuronal damage. Among the factors measured, the production of extracellular superoxide was the most prominent. NADPH oxidase inhibitor, apocynin, attenuated MPTP-induced dopaminergic neurodegeneration only in the presence of glia. More importantly, dopaminergic neurons from mice lacking NADPH oxidase, a key enzyme for superoxide production in immune cells, are significantly more resistant to MPTP neurotoxicity than those from wild-type controls, and microglia dictate the resistance. This study demonstrates that reactive microgliosis triggered by MPTP-induced neuronal injury and NADPH oxidase-mediated superoxide production in microglia constitute an integral component of MPTP neurotoxicity. This study also suggests that NADPH oxidase may be a promising target for therapeutic interventions in Parkinson's disease."
https://openalex.org/W2160399092,"Wogonin (5,7-dihydroxy-8-methoxyflavone), a flavonoid originated from the root of a medicinal herb Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, has been previously shown to have anti-inflammatory activities in various cell types including macrophages. In this work, we have found that wogonin is a potent neuroprotector from natural source. Wogonin inhibited inflammatory activation of cultured brain microglia by diminishing lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1beta, and nitric oxide (NO) production. Wogonin inhibited NO production by suppressing inducible NO synthase (iNOS) induction and NF-kappaB activation in microglia. Inhibition of inflammatory activation of microglia by wogonin led to the reduction in microglial cytotoxicity toward cocultured PC12 cells, supporting a neuroprotective role for wogonin in vitro. The neuroprotective effect of wogonin was further demonstrated in vivo using two experimental brain injury models; transient global ischemia by four-vessel occlusion and excitotoxic injury by systemic kainate injection. In both animal models, wogonin conferred neuroprotection by attenuating the death of hippocampal neurons, and the neuroprotective effect was associated with inhibition of the inflammatory activation of microglia. Hippocampal induction of inflammatory mediators such as iNOS and TNF-alpha was reduced by wogonin in the global ischemia model, and microglial activation was markedly down-regulated by wogonin in the kainate injection model as judged by microglia-specific isolectin B4 staining. Taken together, our results indicate that wogonin exerts its neuroprotective effect by inhibiting microglial activation, which is a critical component of pathogenic inflammatory responses in neurodegenerative diseases. The current study emphasizes the importance of medicinal herbs and their constituents as an invaluable source for the development of novel neuroprotective drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2040673296,"Narp is a neuronal immediate early gene that plays a role in excitatory synaptogenesis. Here, we report that native Narp in brain is part of a pentraxin complex that includes NP1. These proteins are covalently linked by disulfide bonds into highly organized complexes, and their relative ratio in the complex is dynamically dependent upon the neuron's activity history and developmental stage. Complex formation is dependent on their distinct N-terminal coiled-coil domains, while their closely homologous C-terminal pentraxin domains mediate association with AMPA-type glutamate receptors. Narp is substantially more effective in assays of cell surface cluster formation, coclustering of AMPA receptors, and excitatory synaptogenesis, yet their combined expression results in supraadditive effects. These studies support a model in which Narp can regulate the latent synaptogenic activity of NP1 by forming mixed pentraxin assemblies. This mechanism appears to contribute to both activity-independent and activity-dependent excitatory synaptogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1979073092,"We have characterized the morphological and functional properties of the readily releasable pool (RRP) and the reserve pool of synaptic vesicles in frog motor nerve terminals using fluorescence microscopy, electron microscopy, and electrophysiology. At rest, about 20% of vesicles reside in the RRP, which is depleted in about 10 s by high-frequency nerve stimulation (30 Hz); the RRP refills in about 1 min, and surprisingly, refilling occurs almost entirely by recycling, not mobilization from the reserve pool. The reserve pool is depleted during 30 Hz stimulation with a time constant of about 40 s, and it refills slowly (half-time about 8 min) as nascent vesicles bud from randomly distributed cisternae and surface membrane infoldings and enter vesicle clusters spaced at regular intervals along the terminal. Transmitter output during low-frequency stimulation (2-5 Hz) is maintained entirely by RRP recycling; few if any vesicles are mobilized from the reserve pool."

https://openalex.org/W2053126924,"A recently proposed model for voltage-dependent activation in K+ channels, largely influenced by the KvAP X-ray structure, suggests that S4 is located at the periphery of the channel and moves through the lipid bilayer upon depolarization. To investigate the physical distance between S4 and the pore domain in functional channels in a native membrane environment, we engineered pairs of cysteines, one each in S4 and the pore of Shaker channels, and identified two instances of spontaneous intersubunit disulfide bond formation, between R362C/A419C and R362C/F416C. After reduction, these cysteine pairs bound Cd2+ with high affinity, verifying that the residues are in atomic proximity. Molecular modeling based on the MthK structure revealed a single position for S4 that was consistent with our results and many other experimental constraints. The model predicts that S4 is located in the groove between pore domains from different subunits, rather than at the periphery of the protein."
https://openalex.org/W2024538027,"Beneficial effects attributed to green tea, such as its anticancer and antioxidant properties, may be mediated by (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG). In this study, the effects of EGCG on cell proliferation and UV-induced apoptosis were investigated in normal epidermal keratinocytes. When topically applied to aged human skin, EGCG stimulated the proliferation of epidermal keratinocytes, which increased the epidermal thickness. In addition, this topical application also inhibited the UV-induced apoptosis of epidermal keratinocytes. EGCG was found to increase the phosphorylation of Bad protein at the Ser112 and Ser136. Moreover, EGCG-induced Erk phosphorylation was found to be critical for the phosphorylation of Ser112 in Bad protein, and the EGCG-induced activation of the Akt pathway was found to be involved in the phosphorylation of Ser136. Furthermore, EGCG increased Bcl-2 expression but decreased Bax expression, causing an increase in the Bcl-2-to-Bax ratio. In addition, we demonstrate the differential growth inhibitory effects of EGCG on cancer cells. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that EGCG promotes keratinocyte survival and inhibits the UV-induced apoptosis via two mechanisms: by phosphorylating Ser112 and Ser136 of Bad protein through Erk and Akt pathways, respectively, and by increasing the Bcl-2-to-Bax ratio. Moreover, these two proposed mechanisms of EGCG-induced cell proliferation may differ kinetically to promote keratinocyte survival."
https://openalex.org/W2025896287,"The potent neurotoxin kainate activates ion channel-forming receptors. However, it can also activate a G protein-coupled signaling pathway to inhibit transmitter release in central neurons. It remains unclear whether the same receptor complex is involved in both signaling activities. Here we show that in a population of dorsal root ganglion cells, exposure to kainate elicits a G protein-dependent increase in intracellular Ca2+. Furthermore, in these cells a brief exposure to kainate inhibited the K+-induced Ca2+ increase, a process that was sensitive to the G protein inhibitor Pertussis toxin and inhibitors of protein kinase C. This metabotropic action did not require ion channel activity and was not observed in neurons prepared from mice deficient for the ion channel-forming subunit GluR5. These results indicate that GluR5, an ion channel-forming subunit, signals through a second messenger cascade, inhibiting voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels. Thus, such a system represents a noncanonical signaling route of ion channel-forming receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2115852989,"Adrenomedullin (AM) is a multifunctional peptide in human pheochromocytoma. To evaluate whether AM could be an angiogenic factor, we examined its effect on kinases and angiogenic processes. AM induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 (ERK1/2) by using distinct signaling pathways in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). AM also phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase, and phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase inhibitor inhibited AM-induced focal adhesion kinase phosphorylation. Pretreatment with high concentrations of AM22-52, a putative AM receptor antagonist, partially suppressed AM-induced phosphorylation of Akt, ERK1/2, and focal adhesion kinase. AM and vascular endothelial growth factor produced increases in DNA synthesis and migration in HUVECs. AM induced tube formation in HUVECs, and its effect was inhibited by pretreatment with phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase inhibitor or ERK1/2 inhibitor. AM induced sprouting in porcine pulmonary arterial endothelial cells and promoted neovessel formation in a mouse Matrigel plug assay. Inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase and ERK1/2 inhibited AM-induced endothelial sprouting in vitro and angiogenesis in vivo. AM exerts angiogenic activity through activation of Akt, MAPK, and focal adhesion kinase in endothelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2008622025,"Cerebellar granule neuron (CGN) survival depends on activity of the myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF2) transcription factors. Neuronal MEF2 activity is regulated by depolarization via a mechanism that is presently unclear. Here, we show that depolarization-mediated MEF2 activity and CGN survival are compromised by overexpression of the MEF2 repressor histone deacetylase-5 (HDAC5). Furthermore, removal of depolarization induced rapid cytoplasm-to-nuclear translocation of endogenous HDAC5. This effect was mimicked by addition of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase (CaMK) inhibitor KN93 to depolarizing medium. Removal of depolarization or KN93 addition resulted in dephosphorylation of HDAC5 and its co-precipitation with MEF2D. HDAC5 nuclear translocation triggered by KN93 induced a marked loss of MEF2 activity and subsequent apoptosis. To selectively decrease CaMKII, CGNs were incubated with an antisense oligonucleotide to CaMKIIα. This antisense decreased CaMKIIα expression and induced nuclear shuttling of HDAC5 in CGNs maintained in depolarizing medium. Selectivity of the CaMKIIα antisense was demonstrated by its lack of effect on CaMKIV-mediated CREB phosphorylation. Finally, antisense to CaMKIIα induced caspase-3 activation and apoptosis, whereas a missense control oligonucleotide had no effect on CGN survival. These results indicate that depolarization-mediated calcium influx acts through CaMKII to inhibit HDAC5, thereby sustaining high MEF2 activity in CGNs maintained under depolarizing conditions.

In muscle, activity of MEF2 proteins is modulated by calcium-regulated signals that ultimately drive myogenic differentiation (5Wu H. Naya F.J. McKinsey T.A. Mercer B. Shelton J.M. Chin E.R.

MEF2 proteins also play a critical role in the differentiation and survival of neurons in the developing central nervous system (CNS) (2McDermott J.C. Cardoso M.C. Yu Y.T. Andres V. Leifer D.

A. 2000; 97: 7561-7566Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In particular, MEF2 function is essential for activity-dependent neuronal survival mediated through the formation of proper synaptic contacts during CNS development (12Mao Z. Bonni A. Xia F. Nadal-Vicens M. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 785-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). In early postnatal cerebellum, transcripts for two mammalian MEF2 isoforms, MEF2A and MEF2D, are markedly increased in parallel with enhanced expression of the GABAA receptor α6 subunit, a marker for differentiation of mature cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) (9Lin X. Shah S. Bulleit R.F. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 42: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Similarly, primary cultures of CGNs, that require medium containing depolarizing extracellular potassium for their survival (13D'Mello S.R. Galli C. Ciotti T. Calissano P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10989-10993Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar), demonstrate high levels of endogenous MEF2A and MEF2D proteins and MEF2 transcriptional activity. We have previously reported that MEF2A and MEF2D are phosphorylated and subsequently cleaved by caspases in CGNs that are deprived of depolarizing potassium (14Li M. Linseman D.A. Allen M.P. Meintzer M.K. Wang X. Laessig T. Wierman M.E. Heidenreich K.A. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 6544-6552Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting loss of MEF2 transcriptional activity contributes to CGN apoptosis under these conditions. Likewise, Gaudilliere et al. (15Gaudilliere B. Shi Y. Bonni A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46442-46446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) recently showed that down-regulation of MEF2A using RNA interference significantly compromises depolarization-mediated survival of CGNs. Thus, MEF2 proteins transduce activity-dependent calcium signals into an essential pro-survival pathway in CGNs. The precise mechanism(s) by which calcium influx regulates MEF2 activity in CGNs is presently unclear. Previous work in muscle indicates that activity of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent, serine/threonine phosphatase, calcineurin, is required for MEF2 function (16Wu H. Rothermel B. Kanatous S. Rosenberg P. Naya F.J. Shelton J.M. Hutcheson K.A. DiMaio J.M. Olson E.N. Bassel-Duby R. Williams R.S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6414-6423Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Similarly, calcineurin positively regulates MEF2 DNA binding and transcriptional activity in CGNs (17Mao Z. Wiedmann M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31102-31107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In muscle, calcineurin modulation of MEF2 activity is integrated with regulation by a pathway involving calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK) activity (5Wu H. Naya F.J. McKinsey T.A. Mercer B. Shelton J.M. Chin E.R. Simard A.R. Michel R.N. Bassel-Duby R. Olson E.N. Williams R.S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1963-1973Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Muscle MEF2 activity is repressed by interaction with class II histone deacetylases (HDACs) (18Lu J. McKinsey T.A. Nicol R.L. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4070-4075Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 19McKinsey T.A. Zhang C.L. Lu J. Olson E.N. Nature. 2000; 408: 106-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar, 20Dressel U.

Overexpression of constitutively-active CaMK isoforms I and IV in muscle and non-muscle cells (e.g. COS or NIH3T3 fibroblasts) promotes serine phosphorylation of HDACs. Phosphorylation of HDACs induces their nuclear export and promotes their association with cytosolic scaffolding proteins of the 14-3-3 family, ultimately resulting in derepression of MEF2 activity (21McKinsey T.A. Zhang C.L. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14400-14405Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Although these over-expression studies suggest a role for CaMK regulation of HDAC function in muscle, the endogenous CaMK isoform involved has yet to be identified. Moreover, a role for endogenous CaMK activity in modulating MEF2 function in neurons has not yet been investigated. Here, we show that depolarization-mediated MEF2 activity and CGN survival are compromised by overexpression of the class II HDAC, HDAC5. Moreover, removal of depolarizing potassium or addition of a CaMK inhibitor induces nuclear translocation of endogenous HDAC5, loss of MEF2 activity, and CGN apoptosis. Finally, antisense-mediated down-regulation of CaMKIIα expression is sufficient to drive nuclear translocation of HDAC5 and induce CGN apoptosis under depolarizing conditions. These results demonstrate that CaMK-mediated inhibition of HDAC function plays a significant role in the calcium regulation of MEF2 activity and survival in CGNs. In addition, these data are the first to identify an endogenous CaMK isoform (CaMKII) that regulates HDAC function. Materials—A truncated mutant of MEF2A lacking the C-terminal transcriptional activation domain, pcDNA3.1-MEF2A131, was kindly provided by Dr. Ron Prywes (Columbia University, New York). Empty pcDNA3.1 vector was obtained from Invitrogen (Grand Island, NY). Adenoviral green fluorescent protein (Ad-GFP) was a gift from Dr. Jerry Schaack (University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver, CO). The pGL2-MEF2-luciferase reporter plasmid and HA-tagged HDAC5 and HDAC4 were provided by Dr. Saadi Khochbin (INSERM, France). Hoecsht dye number 33258, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), monoclonal antibody to the FLAG epitope, and monoclonal antibody to β-tubulin were from Sigma. Monoclonal antibody to the HA epitope and rabbit polyclonal antibodies to phospho-CREB (Ser-133), HDAC4, and HDAC5 for immunocytochemistry were obtained from Cell Signaling Technologies (Beverly, MA). Rabbit polyclonal antibody to active (cleaved) caspase-3 was from Promega (Madison, WI). Monoclonal antibody to MEF2D for immunocytochemistry and Western blotting was purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Monoclonal antibody to CaMKIIα for immunocytochemistry was from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). According to the manufacturer, this antibody may show some cross-reactivity with CaMKIIδ or γ subunits. FITC- and Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies for immunofluorescence were from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Rabbit polyclonal antibody to MEF2 for immunoprecipitation, rabbit polyclonal antibody to HDAC5 for Western blotting, and protein A/G-agarose were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies and reagents for enhanced chemiluminescence detection were purchased from Amersham Biosciences (Piscataway, NJ). KN93, KN62, phosphorothioate 18-mer antisense oligonucleotide complementary to CaMKIIα subunit mRNA nucleotides 33–50 (unlabeled and FITC-labeled), and an unlabeled, scrambled, missense control oligonucleotide were from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). According to the manufacturer, this antisense construct is highly specific for the α subunit of CaMKII and does not affect CaMKIIβ expression. Cell Culture—Rat CGNs were isolated from 7-day-old Sprague-Dawley rat pups (15–19 g) as described previously (22Li M. Wang X. Meintzer M.K. Laessig T. Birnbaum M.J. Heidenreich K.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9356-9363Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Briefly, neurons were plated on 35-mm diameter plastic dishes coated with poly-l-lysine at a density of 2.0 × 106 cells/ml in basal modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 25 mm KCl, 2 mm l-glutamine, and penicillin (100 units/ml)/streptomycin (100 μg/ml) (Invitrogen). Cytosine arabinoside (10 μm) was added to the culture medium 24 h after plating to limit the growth of non-neuronal cells. Using this protocol, the cultures were ∼95% pure for granule neurons. In general, experiments were performed after 7 days in culture. Preparation of Adenoviral Dominant-negative MEF2 and Adenoviral Infection—pcDNA3.1-MEF2A131 was tagged on the C terminus with the FLAG epitope by polymerase chain reaction. The resulting FLAG-tagged construct was cloned into shuttle vector, and Ad-Flag-MEF2A131 was prepared using the Ad-Easy adenovirus expression kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Quantum Biotechnologies Inc.). Recombinant adenoviruses were purified by cesium chloride gradient ultracentrifugation. The viral titer was determined by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm (where 1.0 absorbance units = 1 × 1012 particles/ml) and infectious particles were verified by plaque assay. Ad-GFP or Ad-FLAG-MEF2A131 was added to CGN cultures on day 4 at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 100. On day 7 (72-h postinfection), CGN apoptosis was assessed in GFP-positive or FLAG-immunoreactive cells by DAPI staining. Quantification of Apoptosis—Apoptosis was assessed by fixing CGNs in 4% paraformaldehyde and staining nuclei with either Hoechst dye (non-permeabilized cells) or DAPI (permeabilized cells for immunocytochemistry). Cells were considered apoptotic if their nuclei were either condensed or fragmented. In general, ∼500 cells from at least two fields of a 35-mm well were counted. For immunocytochemical studies where cells were plated on glass coverslips, ∼100–200 cells from 2–3 coverslips per treatment group were counted. Data are presented as the percentage of cells in a given treatment group which were scored as apoptotic. Experiments were performed on cells isolated from at least three independent preparations. Immunocytochemistry—CGNs were cultured on polyethyleneimine-coated glass cover slips at a density of ∼2.5 × 105 cells per coverslip. Following incubation as described under “Results,” cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and were then permeabilized and blocked in PBS (pH 7.4) containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and 5% BSA. Cells were then incubated for ∼16 h at 4 °C with primary antibody diluted in PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and 2% BSA. The primary antibody was aspirated and the cells were washed five times with PBS. The cells were then incubated with either Cy3-conjugated or FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies and DAPI for 1 h at room temperature. CGNs were then washed five more times with PBS and coverslips were adhered to glass slides in mounting medium (0.1% p-phenylenediamine in 75% glycerol in PBS). Fluorescent images were captured using a 63× oil immersion objective on a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope equipped with a Cooke Sensicam deep-cooled CCD camera and a Slidebook software analysis program for digital deconvolution (Intelligent Imaging Innovations Inc., Denver, CO). Preparation of CGN Cell Extracts—After incubation for the indicated times and with the reagents specified in Results, the culture medium was aspirated; the cells were washed once with 2 ml of ice-cold PBS, pH 7.4, placed on ice, and scraped into lysis buffer (200 μl/35-mm well) containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 μm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 3 min and the protein concentration of the supernatant was determined using a commercially available protein assay kit (Pierce). Aliquots (∼150 μg) of supernatant protein were diluted to a final concentration of 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and electrophoresed through 7.5% polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and processed for immunoblot analysis. Western Blot Analysis—Nonspecific binding sites were blocked in PBS (pH 7.4) containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T) and 1% BSA for 1 h at room temperature. Primary antibodies were diluted in blocking solution and incubated with the membranes for 1 h. Excess primary antibody was removed by washing the membranes three times in PBS-T. The blots were then incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody diluted in PBS-T for 1 h and were subsequently washed three times in PBS-T. Immunoreactive proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. Autoluminograms shown are representative of at least three independent experiments. Immunoprecipitation of MEF2D—CGN lysates were prepared as described above, except in lysis buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100. 4 μg of polyclonal antibody against MEF2D was added to 500 μl of lysate (∼1 μg/μl CGN protein concentration), and samples were mixed for 16 h at 4 °C by continuous inversion. Agarose-conjugated protein A/G (40 μl) was added and samples were mixed for a further 4 h. Immune complexes were pelleted, washed three times with lysis buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100, and boiled in 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Immune complexes were resolved on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride, and immunoblotted for MEF2D and HDAC5. CGN Transfection and Reporter Gene Expression—CGNs were transiently transfected using a calcium phosphate co-precipitation method described previously (14Li M. Linseman D.A. Allen M.P. Meintzer M.K. Wang X. Laessig T. Wierman M.E. Heidenreich K.A. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 6544-6552Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were co-transfected with 1 μg of MEF2-luciferase expression plasmid (pGL2-MEF2-luc), 1 μg of pCMV-β-gal as an internal control for transfection efficiency, and 2 μg of either pcDNA3.1, MEF2A131, or HA-tagged HDAC5. The total amount of DNA for each transfection was kept constant. Following transfection, neurons were placed in conditioned medium and the medium was subsequently changed to serum-free containing either 25 mm KCl or 5 mm KCl. After incubation, cell extracts were prepared using reporter lysis buffer and the activities of luciferase and β-galactosidase were measured with the respective enzyme assay system kits (Promega). Incubation with Antisense Oligonucleotides to CaMKIIα—Phosphorothioate, FITC-labeled or unlabeled, antisense oligonucleotides to CaMKIIα, or a scrambled missense control oligonucleotide, were added directly to the culture medium (each at a final concentration of 1 μm), as was previously described for primary hippocampal neuronal cultures (23Churn S.B. Sombati S. Jakoi E.R. Sievert L. DeLorenzo R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5604-5609Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Following incubation for 8–24 h, cells were processed for immunocytochemical analysis and/or quantification of apoptosis, as described under “Results.” Data Analysis—The results shown represent the means ± S.E. for the number (n) of independent experiments that were performed. Statistical differences between the means of unpaired sets of data were evaluated by one-way analysis of variance, followed by a post-hoc Dunnett's test. A p value of <0.01 was considered statistically significant. Adenoviral Expression of a Dominant-negative MEF2 Mutant Blocks Depolarization-mediated Survival of CGNs—In CGNs co-transfected with a MEF2-luciferase reporter (24Lemercier C. Verdel A. Galloo B. Curtet S. Brocard M.P. Khochbin S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15594-15599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) and empty pcDNA3.1 vector, removal of the depolarization stimulus resulted in a dramatic loss of MEF2 activity (14 ± 2% of control, p < 0.01, Fig. 1A). This effect was mimicked under depolarizing conditions by co-transfection with a truncated, dominant-negative form of MEF2 (MEF2A131) that lacks the transcriptional activation domain. Expression of MEF2A131 decreased endogenous MEF2 activity in the presence of depolarization to 39 ± 6% (p < 0.01) of that observed in cells transfected with empty vector (Fig. 1A). Thus, dominant-negative MEF2 competes with endogenous MEF2 transcription factors for DNA binding, resulting in a loss of endogenous MEF2 activity. Previous studies showing that MEF2 transcription factors are critical for CGN survival utilized either transient transfection protocols of MEF2 mutants (12Mao Z. Bonni A. Xia F. Nadal-Vicens M. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 785-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 14Li M. Linseman D.A. Allen M.P. Meintzer M.K. Wang X. Laessig T. Wierman M.E. Heidenreich K.A. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 6544-6552Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or, more recently, RNA interference methodology to knock down expression of MEF2 proteins (15Gaudilliere B. Shi Y. Bonni A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46442-46446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). One limitation of each of these approaches is that only a small percentage (usually <5%) of the CGNs are transfected. As a means of interfering with MEF2 activity in a larger, and possibly more representative, percentage of the CGN culture, we prepared a FLAG epitope-tagged MEF2A131 and expressed this construct in adenovirus. CGNs maintained in depolarizing medium were then infected with either adenovirus expressing green fluorescent protein (Ad-GFP, to serve as a control for adenoviral infection) or expressing the FLAG-tagged dominant-negative MEF2 (Ad-FLAG-MEF2A131). Each adenovirus was infected into the cells at an m.o.i. of 100 (equivalent to 10,000 infectious particles per cell). At this titer, the relative infection efficiency observed over three independent experiments was ∼35% for Ad-FLAG-MEF2A131. Following infection, cells were incubated for 72 h and MEF2A131-expressing cells were identified by immunocytochemistry with a monoclonal anti-FLAG and a Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody. GFP-positive cells were detected by fluorescence under a FITC filter. Apoptosis was quantified by staining nuclei with DAPI and counting the percentage of GFP-positive or FLAG-MEF2A131-positive cells containing condensed and/or fragmented chromatin. As shown in Fig. 1B, infection with Ad-GFP did not result in significant CGN apoptosis (2 ± 1%), whereas cells expressing the FLAG-MEF2A131 demonstrated massive apoptosis (89 ± 7%), even in the presence of depolarization. In agreement with previous work (12Mao Z. Bonni A. Xia F. Nadal-Vicens M. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 785-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 14Li M. Linseman D.A. Allen M.P.

Chem. 2002; 277: 46442-46446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), our results using an adenoviral dominant-negative MEF2 mutant demonstrate that MEF2 transcriptional activity is a critical component of depolarization-mediated survival signaling in CGNs. Overexpression of the MEF2 Repressor HDAC5 Induces CGN Apoptosis in Depolarizing Medium—The activity of MEF2 transcription factors is repressed in skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle by members of the class II family of HDACs including HDAC4, 5, 7, and 9 (reviewed in Ref. 6McKinsey T.A. Zhang C.L. Olson E.N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 40-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Consistent with a potential role for HDAC regulation of MEF2 activity in CGNs, overexpression of HA-tagged HDAC5 significantly decreased MEF2-driven luciferase activity (56 ± 6% of the empty vector control, p < 0.01) in cells cultured in the presence of depolarizing potassium (Fig. 2A). As a result of the loss in endogenous MEF2 activity, overexpression of HDAC5 induced significant CGN apoptosis (42 ± 1% compared with 17 ± 1% in cells transfected with empty vector, p < 0.01, Fig. 2B). Similar results were obtained following transfection with another class II family member, HDAC4 (data not shown). Thus, depolarization-mediated MEF2 activity and CGN survival are compromised by overexpression of HDAC transcriptional repressors. Removal of Depolarizing Potassium or CaMK Inhibition Induces Cytoplasm-to-Nuclear Translocation of Endogenous HDAC5—We next examined the subcellular localization of endogenous HDAC5 and MEF2D in CGNs maintained in either depolarizing or non-depolarizing medium. Cells cultured in the presence of depolarizing extracellular potassium demonstrated immunocytochemical localization of HDAC5 in the cytoplasm with little to no immunoreactivity observed in nuclei. In contrast, MEF2D was localized exclusively to nuclei, and therefore, there was essentially no overlapping staining for MEF2D and HDAC5 in control CGNs (Fig. 3, left panels). Removal of depolarizing potassium for 4 h induced a dramatic cytoplasm-to-nuclear translocation of endogenous HDAC5, resulting in significant overlap of MEF2D and HDAC5 staining (Fig. 3, middle panels). Previous work in skeletal and cardiac muscle has shown that the subcellular localization of class II HDACs during muscle differentiation can be regulated by CaMK activity (19McKinsey T.A. Zhang C.L. Lu J. Olson E.N. Nature. 2000; 408: 106-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar, 20Dressel U. Bailey P.J. Wang S.C. Downes M. Evans R.M. Muscat G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17007-17013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Overexpression of either constitutively active CaMKI or CaMKIV induced phosphorylation of two serine residues (Ser-259 and Ser-498 in HDAC5) resulting in docking of HDACs to cytoplasmic scaffolding proteins of the 14-3-3 family (21McKinsey T.A. Zhang C.L. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14400-14405Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). In this manner, CaMK-mediated phosphorylation of HDACs results in their nuclear exclusion, allowing for derepression of MEF2 activity that is required for muscle differentiation. To examine if depolarization maintains HDAC5 in the cytoplasm of CGNs via endogenous CaMK activity, cells were incubated in depolarizing medium containing the CaMK inhibitor KN93. Inclusion of KN93 mimicked the effect of removing the depolarization stimulus, resulting in nuclear translocation of HDAC5 and its co-localization with MEF2D (Fig. 3, right panels). In a similar manner, either removal of the depolarization stimulus or addition of KN93 also induced the nuclear translocation of HDAC4 in CGNs (data not shown). These data suggest that depolarization promotes the nuclear exclusion of HDAC5 and 4 via the activity of an endogenous CaMK. CaMK Inhibition Results in Dephosphorylation of HDAC5 and Its Association with MEF2D—To evaluate the phosphorylation status of endogenous HDAC5 in CGNs, we examined the electrophoretic mobility of HDAC5 on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. In cell lysates obtained from CGNs maintained in depolarizing medium, HDAC5 appeared as a broad band or doublet on Western blots (Fig. 4A, first lane). Removal of depolarizing potassium (Fig. 4A, second lane) or addition of the CaMK inhibitor, KN93 (Fig. 4A, third lane), increased the electrophoretic mobility of HDAC5 and resulted in the disappearance of the upper band of the doublet, indicative of a loss of the phosphorylated HDAC5 species. These results suggest that a CaMK activated by depolarization in CGNs regulates the phosphorylation status of HDAC5. To determine if the dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of HDAC5 induced by removal of the depolarization stimulus or CaMK inhibition permits its direct interaction with nuclear MEF2 proteins, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments. MEF2D immune complexes isolated from CGNs maintained in depolarizing medium did not contain any detectable HDAC5 (Fig. 4B, first lane). This finding is consistent with the immunocytochemical data shown in Fig. 3 that demonstrated little co-localization of MEF2D and HDAC5 under control conditions. In contrast, MEF2D isolated from cells incubated in either non-depolarizing medium or in the presence of KN93 co-precipitated wit"
https://openalex.org/W2129107858,"Nitric oxide (NO) has been implicated in the development of heart failure, although the source, significance, and functional role of the different NO synthase (NOS) isoforms in this pathology are controversial. The presence of a neuronal-type NOS isoform (NOS1) in the cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum has been recently discovered, leading to the hypothesis that NOS1-derived NO may notably alter myocardial inotropy. However, the regulation and role(s) of NOS1 in cardiac diseases remain to be determined. Using an experimental model of myocardial infarction (MI) in senescent rats, we demonstrated a significant increase in cardiac NOS1 expression and activity in MI, coupled with the translocation of this enzyme to the sarcolemma through interactions with caveolin-3. The enhanced NOS1 activity counteracts the decrease in cardiac NOS3 expression and activity observed in heart failure. We demonstrated an increased interaction between NOS1 and its regulatory protein HSP90 in post-MI hearts, a potential mechanism for the higher NOS1 activity in this setting. Finally, preferential in vivo inhibition of NOS1 activity enhanced basal post-MI left ventricular dysfunction in senescent rats. These results provide the first evidence that increased NOS1-derived NO production may play a significant role in the autocrine regulation of myocardial contractility after MI in aging rats."
https://openalex.org/W1966417898,"The Pdcd4 gene has originally been isolated in a search for genes that are activated in cells undergoing apoptosis. Independent of these studies, the Pdcd4 gene has been implicated in the suppression of tumor-promoter-mediated transformation of keratinocytes and as a downstream target of Myb in hematopoietic cells. The Pdcd4 protein has weak homology to the eucaryotic translation initiation factor eIF4G and has been shown to interact with certain translation initiation factors. To explore the molecular function of the Pdcd4 protein, we have studied its subcellular localization. We show that the Pdcd4 protein is a predominantly nuclear protein under normal growth conditions and that it is exported from the nucleus by a leptomycin B-sensitive mechanism upon serum withdrawal. The protein contains two nuclear export signals, one of which is very potent. In addition, we demonstrate that the Pdcd4 protein has RNA-binding activity and that the sequences involved in RNA-binding are located in the amino-terminal part of the protein. Taken together, our data raise the possibility that Pdcd4 is involved in some aspect of nuclear RNA metabolism in addition to its suspected role in protein translation."
https://openalex.org/W1576504870,"Aquaporin 2 (AQP2) phosphorylation at Ser-256 by protein kinase A (PKA) is a key signal for vasopressin-stimulated AQP2 insertion into the plasma membrane in renal cells. This study underscores the possible role of phosphorylation at Ser-256 in regulating AQP2 maturation. AQP2-transfected renal CD8 cells were incubated with brefeldin A (BFA) to accumulate newly synthesized AQP2 in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and AQP2 flow from ER to the vesicular compartment was analyzed after BFA washout. We found that a) in the ER, AQP2 is weakly phosphorylated; b) the amount of phosphorylated AQP2 (p-AQP2) at Ser-256 increased significantly during transit in the Golgi, even in the presence of the PKA inhibitor H89; and c) AQP2 transport from the Golgi to the vasopressin-regulated vesicular compartment occurred with a concomitant decrease in p-AQP2 at Ser-256. These results support the hypothesis that AQP2 transition in the Golgi apparatus is associated with a PKA-independent increase in AQP2 phosphorylation at Ser-256. Conversely, impaired constitutive phosphorylation in a Golgi-associated compartment occurring in cells expressing mutated S256A-AQP2 or E258K-AQP2 causes phosphorylation-defective AQP2 routing to lysosomes. This result might explain the molecular basis of the dominant form of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus caused by the mutation E258K-AQP2, in which the phenotype is caused by an impaired routing of AQP2."
https://openalex.org/W2019293218,"Voltage-gated calcium channels couple changes in membrane potential to neuronal functions regulated by calcium, including neurotransmitter release. Here we report that presynaptic N-type calcium channels not only control neurotransmitter release but also regulate synaptic growth at Drosophila neuromuscular junctions. In a screen for behavioral mutants that disrupt synaptic transmission, an allele of the N-type calcium channel locus (Dmca1A) was identified that caused synaptic undergrowth. The underlying molecular defect was identified as a neutralization of a charged residue in the third S4 voltage sensor. RNA interference reduction of N-type calcium channel expression also reduced synaptic growth. Hypomorphic mutations in syntaxin-1A or n-synaptobrevin, which also disrupt neurotransmitter release, did not affect synapse proliferation at the neuromuscular junction, suggesting calcium entry through presynaptic N-type calcium channels, not neurotransmitter release per se, is important for synaptic growth. The reduced synapse proliferation in Dmca1A mutants is not due to increased synapse retraction but instead reflects a role for calcium influx in synaptic growth mechanisms. These results suggest N-type channels participate in synaptic growth through signaling pathways that are distinct from those that mediate neurotransmitter release. Linking presynaptic voltage-gated calcium entry to downstream calcium-sensitive synaptic growth regulators provides an efficient activity-dependent mechanism for modifying synaptic strength.

Axonal sprouting and synaptic rewiring are key regulators of neuronal plasticity in the developing and adult brain (1Reisman G. Brain Res. 1969; 14: 25-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar, 2Tsukahara N. Hultborn H. Murakami F. Fujito Y. J. Neurophysiol. 1975; 38: 1359-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Both synapse formation (3Luscher C. Nicoll R.A. Malenka R.C. Muller D. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 545-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar) and synapse elimination (4Lichtman J.W. Colman H. Neuron. 2000; 25: 269-278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) have been suggested to underlie structural changes in the wiring of the nervous system important for long term modification of brain function. Modulation of synapse formation in Drosophila has been implicated in olfactory learning (5Grotewiel M.S. Beck C.D. Wu K.H. Zhu X.R. Davis R.L. Nature. 1998; 391: 455-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Likewise, long term habituation and sensitization in Aplysia are associated with short term alterations in synaptic connections between sensory and motor neurons (6Bailey C.H. Chen M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2373-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Long term potentiation in the hippocampus is accompanied by changes in the number, size, and structure of synapses within the affected circuit (7Buchs P.A. Muller D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8040-8045Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 8Engert F. Bonhoeffer T. Nature. 1999; 399: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (1387) Google Scholar). One signaling pathway required for these structural changes is the cyclic AMP cascade, which participates in hippocampal long term potentiation (9Huang Y.Y. Li X.C. Kandel E.R. Cell. 1994; 79: 69-79Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar), long term facilitation in Aplysia (10Schacher S. Castellucci V.F. Kandel E.R. Science. 1988; 240: 1667-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), and activity-dependent plasticity in Drosophila (11Zhong Y. Wu C.F. Science. 1991; 251: 198-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Notably, the synaptic structure at neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) 1The abbreviations used are: NMJs, neuromuscular junctions; EMS, ethyl methanesulfonate; DLMs, dorsal longitudinal flight muscles; CS, Canton S; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; SNARE, SNARE, soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor; TS, temperature-sensitive; ORF, open reading frame; CaMKII, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II. is dramatically altered in Drosophila mutants defective in cAMP metabolism (12Zhong Y. Budnik V. Wu C.F. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 644-651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to cAMP, one synaptic signaling molecule that may function in synaptic development is calcium, which has numerous downstream effectors implicated in behavioral and synaptic plasticity. Voltage-gated calcium channels are a major source of calcium entry into synapses and are multimeric proteins containing a pore-forming α-subunit and accessory β- and α2δ-subunits. A large family of these channels has been identified with isoforms classified according to their gating kinetics, single channel conductances, and pharmacological profiles (13Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 521-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1958) Google Scholar). Five high threshold subtypes (L, N, P, Q, and R), together with the low threshold T-type, form the major calcium entry pathways in mammalian excitable cells. Genome sequencing has revealed a conserved set of L-, T-, and N-type calcium channels throughout vertebrate and invertebrate evolution (14Bargmann C.I. Science. 1998; 282: 2028-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar, 15Littleton J.T. Ganetzky B. Neuron. 2000; 26: 35-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Localized elevation of calcium concentration during presynaptic depolarization triggers the fusion of synaptic vesicles and subsequent neurotransmitter release. However, other roles for presynaptic calcium entry during synaptic transmission are poorly defined. The Drosophila NMJ provides a useful model system for determining the role of N-type calcium channels in synapse formation. Shortly after motor neurons leave the central nervous system and contact their muscle target, there is a well defined morphological transition from growth cone to pre-varicosity to varicosity that occurs over several hours (16Yoshihara M. Rheuben M.B. Kidokoro Y. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8408-8426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Following initial synapse formation, there is a second phase of synaptic development that results in an ∼10-fold increase in varicosity number on the well studied ventral muscle fibers 6 and 7 during the period between embryogenesis to the third larval instar phase. This growth process is characterized by the addition of new varicosities and additional synaptic branches (17Zito K. Parnas D. Fetter R.D. Isacoff E.Y. Goodman C.S. Neuron. 1999; 22: 719-729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). For new synaptic connections to form, changes in existing terminals must allow for directed synaptic growth and sprouting. These structural changes require temporally controlled and spatially regulated modifications to the nerve terminal cytoskeleton and trans-synaptic cell adhesion complexes. Several calcium-dependent proteins have been implicated in synaptic growth, but the source of calcium and its regulation are unknown. Here we demonstrate that presynaptic N-type calcium channels contribute to the regulation of synaptic growth. The requirement of N-type channels for synaptic growth is not dependent upon its role in triggering neurotransmitter release, but rather reflects a requirement for calcium influx. These findings indicate N-type calcium channels provide an important source of calcium that regulates synaptic growth. Drosophila Genetics—Drosophila melanogaster was cultured on standard medium at 22 °C. Temperature-sensitive behavioral mutants on the X chromosome were generated by feeding isogenized Canton S males with ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) for 12 h and mating to C (1)DX females via standard techniques (55Lewis E.B.

Extracellular field potentials were recorded by placing a sharp glass electrode near the longitudinal flight muscles after piercing the cuticle, with a reference electrode in the fly head. Temperature shifts were performed by heating mounting clay encompassing the fly to the desired temperature with a peltier heating device. Immunostaining was performed on third instar larvae at wandering stage after rearing at 22 °C. Larvae were dissected in Drosophila saline and fixed in 4% formaldehyde in HL3 for 45 min. Immunostaining on filleted embryos was performed as described previously (16Yoshihara M. Rheuben M.B. Kidokoro Y. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8408-8426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Embryos were dissected at 21–24 h (25 °C) after fertilization. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated IgG against HRP, which labels neuronal cell membranes (57Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Immunoreactive proteins were visualized on a Zeiss Pascal Confocal using fluorescent secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes, Chemicon, The Jackson Laboratory). All error measurements are S.E. unless indicated. dsRNA Interference—Wild-type embryos were collected at stage 5, dechorionated, mounted on coverslips with double-stick tape, and allowed to desiccate for 6 min at 18 °C. The embryos were covered with halocarbon oil and injected with ∼34 picoliters of a 3 μm solution of Dmca1A dsRNA in injection buffer or with injection buffer alone. dsRNA was isolated by PCR amplification of a 725-bp region corresponding to Dmca1A nucleotides 50–772 (following the initiating ATG) using gene-specific PCR primers with the T7 RNA polymerase sequence attached to the 5′ end: primer 1, 5′-gaattaatacgactcactatagggagacattgtttattctaaccgag-3′; and primer 2, 5′-gaattaatacgactcactatagggagacgatattatcgaaactcgtg-3′. Two μg of PCR product was used directly in an in vitro RNA transcription reaction with T7 RNA polymerase using the Megascript Kit (Ambion) and purified with the Mega Clear Kit (Ambion). dsRNA was evaluated by gel electrophoresis prior to use. Following injection, embryos were incubated at 18 °C until hatching, at which time they were transferred to grape juice plates with yeast paste. Larvae were allowed to develop into third instar larvae at 25 °C and processed for immunocytochemistry as described above. Sequencing—Dmca1ANT27 and CS cDNA was used as template to PCR-amplify the complete ORF in two segments. High fidelity Taq (Takara) was used for these reactions to minimize PCR-introduced errors. Sequencing primers spanning the full ORF were used to sequence in duplicate from either of these two templates in both the forward and reverse direction. Sequences were aligned and compared with the predicted ORF using commercially available software. To identify neuronal mechanisms that underlie synaptic function, we conducted large scale behavioral screens in Drosophila for EMS-induced temperature-sensitive (TS) paralytic mutations that result in motor abnormalities at 38 °C. Mutagenized homozygous viable lines were screened for behavioral defects by observing each strain individually in preheated vials in a 38 °C water bath for 5 min. Any strain showing behavioral abnormalities such as paralysis or abnormal seizure-like movements (Fig. 1, A and B) was maintained as a laboratory stock and subjected to two additional screening procedures to detect electrophysiological and morphological defects. First, the mutants were analyzed for temperature-induced seizure activity by screening for recurrent spontaneous neural activity in the adult giant fiber system at the nonpermissive temperature (Fig. 1, C–F). The giant fiber flight circuit is important in escape responses and flight initiation and includes both chemical and electrical synapses. The pathway can be activated by stimulation of the brain, and extracellular recordings can be made from the dorsal longitudinal flight muscles (DLMs). Wild-type Drosophila (Canton S) display little to no spontaneous activity when the temperature is raised to 38 °C (Fig. 1C). In contrast, many of the TS mutants resulted in robust spontaneous spiking in the DLM flight muscles when exposed to the nonpermissive temperature (Fig. 1, D–F). The activation of the DLM flight muscles reflects the firing rate of the innervating motor neurons. To date, 37 seizure-inducing mutations that define 12 complementation groups on the X chromosome have been identified in large scale screens of homozygous viable lines generated in the lab. To examine the link between neuronal activity and synaptic development, we performed a morphological analysis of the seizure mutant collection by visualizing axonal arborizations and terminal morphology with anti-HRP (a general neuronal marker) and anti-synaptotagmin (an antibody against an abundant synaptic vesicle protein) immunocytochemistry at muscle fibers 6 and 7 of third instar larvae. This larval synapse is more accessible to morphological studies than the DLM pathway described above. Abnormal overproliferation of presynaptic varicosities was observed in several of the seizure mutants, 2Z. Guan and J. T. Littleton, unpublished observations. similar to the excessive synaptic overgrowth seen in Shaker, ether-a-go-go mutants secondary to increased nerve activity (18Budnik V. Zhong Y. Wu C.F. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 3754-3768Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Notably in our screen, a single complementation group defined by four EMS alleles resulted in a decrease in axonal terminal branching and synaptic varicosity number (see below), suggesting the mutated gene product defined by this complementation group is likely to function in the control of synaptic growth. The synaptic undergrowth in the mutant, as opposed to the increased synaptic overproliferation observed in several hyperexcitable mutants, prompted us to clone the mutated gene product to characterize further its role in synaptic structure and function. To identify the gene product defined by this complementation group, we mapped the TS phenotype to 33 centimorgans on the X chromosome via recombination. Subsequent deficiency mapping placed the complementation group near the Dmca1A locus. Complementation analysis with null mutants of Dmca1A (cacophony/nightblind/L(1)L13) demonstrated that the four mutations we isolated (NT27, TS3, TS4, TS5) represented new Dmca1A alleles that disrupt the Drosophila homolog of the N-type calcium channel. Upon exposure to 38 °C, the Dmca1A TS alleles, unlike wild-type CS controls, showed a rapid onset of uncoordination, seizure-like activity, and loss of motor control (Fig. 1A). All of the alleles except one showed a rapid recovery when returned to room temperature, regardless of the length of exposure to 38 °C (Fig. 1B). Dmca1ANT27 was the most severe allele isolated, requiring progressively longer recovery times with increased length of exposure to 38 °C. The temperature-sensitive phenotype of each allele was rescued with a small chromosomal duplication (Dp(1;2)v65b) encompassing the wild-type Dmca1A locus (19Smith L.A. Wang X. Peixoto A.A. Neumann E.K. Hall L.M. Hall J.C. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7868-7879Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating the behavioral defects result from disruption of the N-type calcium channel. Behavioral analysis of the TS mutants as well as complementation testing with other Dmca1A alleles suggest an allelic series of decreasing severity, NT27 > TS3 > TS4 > TS5. The most severe allele, Dmca1ANT27 , also shows behavioral defects at room temperature when placed in trans to a null mutant (Dmca1A13) (19Smith L.A. Wang X. Peixoto A.A. Neumann E.K. Hall L.M. Hall J.C. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7868-7879Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These flies are flightless, exhibit an uncoordinated gait, and have reduced viability and life span. Thus, Dmca1ANT27 mutants disrupt N-type calcium channel function constitutively, with the defect becoming worse at the elevated temperature. Further reduction in channel function at 38 °C triggers the onset of seizure-like activity in the giant fiber circuit (Fig. 1, E and F), accounting for the rapid onset of behavioral dysfunction. To determine the cause of the behavioral and physiological defects observed in Dmca1ANT27 , we sequenced the calcium channel ORF in the mutant. A single bp change (CGT to TGT) at position 2626 of the ORF was detected that converted a charged arginine residue at site 876 to a neutral cysteine residue (Fig. 2A). This amino acid substitution was confirmed by sequencing an independent isolate of the Dmca1ANT27 cDNA. Arginine 876 is a universally conserved residue in all voltage-gated ion channels (Fig. 2B) and corresponds to the third charged residue of the S4 voltage sensor in the third set of six transmembrane domains. We were unable to test directly the effect of the R876C change on the current-voltage relationship of the mutant channel, as Drosophila presynaptic terminals are inaccessible for direct voltage clamp analysis, and experimental attempts to express recombinant Drosophila calcium channels in heterologous systems have not succeeded (20Ren D. Xu H. Eberl D.F. Chopra M. Hall L.M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2335-2341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the identical charged arginine residue altered in Dmca1ANT27 has been mutated to a cysteine in recombinant Shaker potassium channels and mammalian L-type calcium channels and expressed in oocytes, mimicking the R876C defect found in Dmca1ANT27 mutants (21Garcia J. Nakai J. Imoto K. Beam K.G. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 2515-2523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 22Shao X.M. Papazian M. Neuron. 1993; 11: 343-352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In both cases, the R876C charge neutralization reduces the sensitivity of the channel to voltage, shifting the conductance-voltage relationship and requiring more depolarization for channel activation. Indeed, the third arginine in the S4 voltage domain has been shown to contribute more than any other S4 charged residue in determining total gating charge for voltage-dependent channels (23Tytgat J. Nakazawa K. Gross A. Hess P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23777-23779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Drosophila genome encodes three calcium channel α-subunit genes (15Littleton J.T. Ganetzky B. Neuron. 2000; 26: 35-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), including homologs of the mammalian T-type, L-type (Dmca1D), and N-type (Dmca1A) channels (Fig. 2C). Previous physiological analysis in Dmca1A mutants has confirmed that N-type calcium channels are the primary source of extracellular calcium entry into Drosophila presynaptic nerve terminals (24Kawasaki F. Felling R. Ordway R.W. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 4885-4889Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether Dmca1ANT27 disrupts calcium channel function at the permissive temperature where we observe the morphological defects in synapse formation, we examined neurotransmitter release at 22 °C. Calcium influx through voltage-dependent calcium channels triggers presynaptic vesicle fusion, allowing us to test the in vivo effects of the R876C change in Dmca1A. Electrophysiological recordings at the neuromuscular junction of third instar Dmca1ANT27 larvae demonstrated a dramatic defect in evoked neurotransmitter release compared with control animals (Fig. 3, A–C). At low extracellular calcium levels, evoked release was undetectable in the mutants upon nerve stimulation, whereas control lines showed substantial synaptic transmission. At higher calcium levels, evoked release was partially restored, but with a greatly reduced quantal content compared with controls. Mini amplitude was unchanged in the mutant (CS, 0.87 ± 0.05 mV; Dmca1ANT27 /Dmca1A13 , 0.89 ± 0.04 mV), indicating post-synaptic sensitivity was not affected, and the observed defects in evoked release represent presynaptic dysfunction. Likewise, mini frequency was in the normal range in Dmca1ANT27 , indicating spontaneous release was largely unaffected. The electrophysiological analysis of neurotransmitter release in Dmca1ANT27 mutants confirms that the R876C change disrupts calcium channel function, calcium entry, and subsequent vesicle fusion. Our initial observations of abnormal synaptic development in the Dmca1ANT27 mutant suggested that presynaptic calcium entry might not only control neurotransmitter release but also modulate synaptic growth. To explore this possibility, we performed a quantitative analysis of synaptic growth in the mutants by visualizing anti-synaptotagmin staining as a presynaptic marker (Fig. 4, A and B). In Drosophila larvae, each abdominal hemisegment (A2–A7) has a stereotyped musculature with a precise motor neuron innervation pattern. In wild-type third instar larvae, an average of 65 ± 2.5 (S.E.) varicosities are present on muscle fibers 6 and 7 (average of segments A3 to A5). In contrast, both Dmca1ANT27 homozygotes and Dmca1ANT27 /Dmca1A13 larvae showed a significant reduction in varicosity number. Dmca1ANT27 /Dmca1A13 third instar larvae had on average 42 ± 2.4 (S.E.) varicosities, a 35% reduction in synaptic growth (p < 1 × 10–8, Student's t test). This defect was also manifested at other NMJ synapses, including those at muscle fiber 4, where we observed a 34% reduction in varicosity number in Dmca1ANT27 /Dmca1A13 third instar larvae compared with controls. In addition, Dmca1ANT27 mutants exhibited reduced axonal terminal branching and a smaller synaptic innervation domain (Fig. 4B). Because NMJ growth varies in proportion with muscle size (25Schuster C.M. Davis G.W. Fetter R.D. Goodman C.S. Neuron. 1996; 17: 655-667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), we assayed in detail NMJ 6/7s at segment A2 in control and Dmca1ANT27 mutants and normalized measurements to muscle surface area. Normalized varicosity number was also significantly (p < 0.05) reduced in mutant animals (Fig. 4F). To confirm further that calcium channel dysfunction results in altered synaptic growth, we used RNA interference to generate loss-of-function animals for morphological characterization. We injected double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) prepared from Dmca1A or buffer alone into stage 5 CS embryos. 85% of embryos injected with Dmca1A dsRNA resulted in late stage embryonic lethality (compared with only 28% lethality for bufferonly injections), mimicking the embryonic lethal phase of Dmca1A null mutants. The remaining 15% of animals were able to hatch and proceed through development, suggesting RNA interference generated partial loss-of-function mutants in a small number of cases. We used these animals to quantify the number of varicosities at muscle 6/7 (segments A3 to A5) and normalized measurements to muscle surface area in both buffer and Dmca1A dsRNA-injected third instar larvae. Similar to observations in Dmca1ANT27 mutants, normalized varicosity number in Dmca1A dsRNA-injected animals was reduced by 32% (p < 0.001) compared with buffer only-injected animals (Fig. 4G). These observations suggest that either presynaptic calcium entry or synaptic transmission is an important modulator of synaptic growth during development. To differentiate between these two possibilities, we examined synaptic development in viable hypomorphic mutations of n-synaptobrevin and syntaxin-1A that disrupt SNARE-mediated vesicle fusion and result in more severe defects in neurotransmitter release than observed in Dmca1ANT27 mutants (26Stewart B.A. Mohtashami M. Trimble W.S. Boulianne G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13955-13960Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). If defects in neurotransmitter release were the cause of the abnormal synaptic proliferation, we would expect a similar, if not more severe, reduction in synaptic growth in the two SNARE mutants. However, this was not observed. Mutations in syntaxin-1A or nsynaptobrevin did not affect synapse proliferation at the third instar NMJ (Fig. 4, C and D) and showed varicosity numbers identical to controls (Fig. 4E). These observations are in agreement with previous analysis of synaptic growth in synaptotagmin (27DiAntonio A. Schwarz T.L. Neuron. 1994; 12: 909-920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) and SNARE mutants (26Stewart B.A. Mohtashami M. Trimble W.S. Boulianne G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13955-13960Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Thus, our data suggest that calcium entry through presynaptic N-type calcium channels, not neurotransmitter release per se, is important for normal synaptic growth. To address whether N-type calcium channels are required for the initial formation of the synapse during embryogenesis, or instead function in the second phase of developmental synaptic proliferation at the NMJ, we analyzed synapse formation in Dmca1A null mutant embryos. Previous genetic analysis of Dmca1A revealed several lethal mutations that map to the locus (19Smith L.A. Wang X. Peixoto A.A. Neumann E.K. Hall L.M. Hall J.C. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7868-7879Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Out of five embryonic lethal alleles of Dmca1A, we examined Dmca1A6, Dmca1A10, Dmca1A13, Dmca1A20 , and Dmca1A24 ; Dmca1A13 behaves similar to a deficiency in complementation testing with our TS mutants and has been reported previously (19Smith L.A. Wang X. Peixoto A.A. Neumann E.K. Hall L.M. Hall J.C. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7868-7879Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to act as a null mutant in complementation testing with other cacophany and nightblind alleles of the Dmca1A locus. Therefore, we performed immunocytochemistry on Dmca1A13 embryos in trans to a small deficiency (Df(1)RC29) that removes the Dmca1A locus. Morphological analysis with anti-HRP and anti-synaptotagmin revealed that Dmca1A null mutants and Dmca1ANT27 hypomorphic mutants do not affect neuronal pathfinding or synaptic morphology at muscle fiber 6/7 in fully matured embryos (Fig. 5, A–C). These data rule out a role for presynaptic calcium entry through N-type calcium channels in the initial stages of growth cone guidance and synapse formation. Given the evidence for a role for calcium in axonal pathfinding and neurite extension in neuronal culture systems, we considered the possibility that L-type channels may function in this regard. Mutations in the L-type channel have been generated previously and cause embryonic lethality secondary to a loss of muscle contractions (28Eberl D.F. Ren D. Feng G. Lorenz L.J. Van Vactor D. Hall L.M. Genetics. 1998; 148: 1159-1169Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we generated double mutants disrupting both N-type and L-type channels. Immunocytochemical analysis of double mutants removing both channels revealed normal axonal pathfinding and initial synapse formation (Fig. 5D). One possibility is that intracellular"

Blockade of either the ligand or the receptor improves survival rates in experimental sepsis. In the current study, sepsis was induced in rats by cecal ligation/puncture. Early in sepsis C5aR content on neutrophils significantly dropped, reached the nadir at 24 h after onset of sepsis, and progressively elevated thereafter. Western-blot, RT-PCR, and confocal microscopy analyses revealed that the loss and re-expression of C5aR during sepsis might be due, at least in part, to the receptor internalization and reconstitution. The reduction and reconstitution of C5aR correlate with the loss and restoration of innate immune functions of blood neutrophils (chemotaxis and reactive oxygen species production), respectively. Quantitative measurements of C5aR on blood neutrophils are highly predictive of survival or death during sepsis. These data suggest that neutrophil C5aR content represents an essential component of an efficient defense system in sepsis and may serve as a prognostic marker for the outcome."

We have therefore studied the interaction between PPARgamma and inducible cyclo-oxygenase (COX-2) in rat aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (RASMC)s. The synthetic PPARgamma ligand rosiglitazone induced prostaglandin (PG) release from RASMCs, including that of PGD2, the precursor of the putative endogenous PPARgamma ligand 15-deoxy-Delta12,14-prostaglandin J2. Moreover, rosiglitazone both synergized with IL-1beta to further induce prostaglandin release and affected the expression of phospholipase A2 and COX-2. Rosiglitazone-induced prostaglandin release was inhibited by the PPARgamma partial agonist GW0072 and the PPARgamma antagonist GW9662. Rosiglitazone also induced RASMC apoptosis, an effect not explained as an autocrine effect of the induced-prostanoids, but on arachidonic acid release, as cell death was unaffected by either the nonselective COX inhibitor piroxicam or the selective COX-2 inhibitor DFP, but by inhibitors of either secretory or cytosolic phospholipase A2. In contrast, indomethacin, an alternative inhibitor of cyclooxygenase activity, inhibited both rosiglitazone-induced cell death, and rosiglitazone-induced PPAR reporter gene activation."

CAR binds as a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) to specific DNA sites, called response elements (REs). Clusters of CAR REs, referred to as phenobarbital response enhancer modules (PBREMs), have been identified in several CAR target genes. In this study we confirm that REs formed by direct repeats of two AGTTCA hexamers with 4 spacing nucleotides are optimal for the binding of CAR-RXR heterodimers. In addition, we found that the heterodimers also form complexes on everted repeat-type arrangements with 8 spacing nucleotides. We also observed that CAR is able to bind DNA as a monomer and to interact in this form with different coregulators even in the presence of RXR. Systematic variation of the nucleotides 5′-flanking to both AGTTCA hexamers showed that the dinucleotide sequence modulates the DNA complex formation of CAR monomers and CAR-RXR heterodimer by a factor of up to 20. The highest preference was found for the sequence AG and lowest for CC. The increased DNA affinity of CAR is mediated by the positively charged arginines 90 and 91 located in the carboxyl-terminal extension of the DNA-binding domain of the receptor. Furthermore, we show that one of the three CAR REs of the human UGT1A1 PBREM is exclusively bound by CAR monomers and this is regulated by ligands that bind to this nuclear receptor.

Repa J.J. Evans R.M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1866-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (1679) Google Scholar). The existence of a highly conserved DNA-binding domain (DBD) and a carboxyl-terminal, structurally conserved ligand-binding domain define the family (2Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schütz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 835-839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6043) Google Scholar). The ligand-binding domains of most NRs consist of 12 α-helices that form a characteristic, 3-layer sandwich. The most carboxyl-terminal helix, helix 12, contains the activation function 2 domain, which serves as a molecular switch by interacting in the agonistic conformation of the ligand-binding domain with coactivator proteins that activate target gene transcription via further protein-protein interactions (3Rachez C. Freedman L.P. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 246: 9-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). NRs can also contribute to gene silencing via the interaction with corepressor proteins that in turn contact histone deacetylases (4Polly P. Herdick M. Moehren U. Baniahmad A. Heinzel T. Carlberg C. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1455-1463Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The receptors for estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, cortisol, aldosterone, 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, thyroid hormone, and all-trans-retinoic acid are classical endocrine NRs (5Carlberg C. Biofactors. 1999; 10: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, most of the superfamily members were cloned before their specific ligands were known and were described as orphan NRs (6Blumberg B. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3149-3155Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Subsequently, some of these compounds, which act as ligands for these orphan NRs, have been identified (1Chawla A. Repa J.J. Evans R.M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1866-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (1679) Google Scholar). One of these adopted orphan NRs is the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR; NR1I3 (7Committee Nuclear-Receptor Cell. 1999; 97: 161-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar)), which has recently been implicated in mediating the effects of xenobiotics on the expression of enzymes, such as cytochrome P450s (8Honkakoski P. Zelko I. Sueyoshi T. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5652-5658Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar) and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) (9Sugatani J. Kojima H. Ueda A. Kakizaki S. Yoshinari K. Gong Q.H. Owens I.S. Negishi M. Sueyoshi T. Hepatology. 2001; 33: 1232-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). In contrast to classical endocrine NRs that show a very selective ligand binding with Kd values in the order of 1 nm or lower (10Herdick M. Bury Y. Quack M. Uskokovic M. Polly P. Carlberg C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 1206-1217PubMed Google Scholar), CAR binds a variety of structurally diverse compounds that display a relatively low affinity (Ki in the order of 1 μm) (11Moore L.B. Parks D.J.

Interestingly, CAR differs from most other NRs by having a strong constitutive activity in the absence of ligand. This can be reduced by the binding of the inverse agonist 5α-androstan-3α-ol or potentiated by the agonists 5β-pregnane-3,20-dione (11Moore L.B. Parks D.J. Jones S.A. Bledsoe R.K. Consler T.G.

The crystal structure of a DNA-bound thyroid hormone receptor (T3R)-RXR heterodimer (22Rastinejad F. Perlmann T. Evans R.M. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1995; 375: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar) demonstrated a head-to-tail arrangement of the receptors with the T3R DBD binding to the downstream motif and the RXR DBD binding to the upstream motif. Moreover, this study showed that ∼65% of the DNA contacts of the T3R-RXR heterodimer are meditated by T3R and explained why this receptor is able to act as a monomer as well (23Quack M. Carlberg C. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 387-393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Schräder M. Becker-Andre M. Carlberg C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6444-6449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is inferred that CAR-RXR heterodimers show the same type of DNA binding and polarity as T3R-RXR heterodimers (22Rastinejad F. Perlmann T. Evans R.M. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1995; 375: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 25Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 375: 190-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, the investigation of natural CAR responding genes indicated that a single CAR RE seems to be insufficient for mediating the regulatory role of the receptor and that more likely at least two CAR REs in close proximity to each other are necessary. These multiple CAR RE clusters are commonly called phenobarbital response enhancer modules (PBREMs). The CYP2B6 gene contains two DR4-type REs with an additional binding site for the transcription factor NF-1 (8Honkakoski P. Zelko I. Sueyoshi T. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5652-5658Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar), whereas the PBREM of the UGT1A1 gene is formed by three CAR REs (9Sugatani J. Kojima H. Ueda A. Kakizaki S. Yoshinari K. Gong Q.H. Owens I.S. Negishi M. Sueyoshi T. Hepatology. 2001; 33: 1232-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). The authors demonstrated that the three REs of the UGT1A1 PBREM are necessary for full ligand responsiveness, but how they act together is still unknown. Although T3R preferentially acts as a heterodimer, the T3R monomer bound to DNA has been shown to be a fully competent transcription factor (23Quack M. Carlberg C. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 387-393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Schräder M. Becker-Andre M. Carlberg C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6444-6449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Monomer binding in other members of the NR superfamily (e.g. NGFI-B (26Wilson T.E. Fahrner T.J. Johnston M. Milbrandt J. Science. 1991; 252: 1296-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar) and ROR (27Carlberg C. Hooft van Huijsduijnen R. Staple J.K. DeLamarter J.F. Becker-Andre M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 757-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar)) appears to be mediated by the Grip box, which is a carboxyl-terminal extension of the DBD (28Zhao Q. Khorasanizadeh S. Miyoshi Y. Lazar M.A. Rastinejad F. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 849-861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). This box provides receptor-specific interfaces for an interaction with the nucleotides that flank the 5′ end of the hexameric binding motif. It is known that the DNA binding affinity of T3R monomers is strongly modulated by the two nucleotides that directly flank the hexameric binding motif (24Schräder M. Becker-Andre M. Carlberg C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6444-6449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, it has been shown that these two 5′-flanking nucleotides also modulate the DNA complex formation of T3R-RXR and VDR-RXR heterodimers (29Quack M. Frank C. Carlberg C. J. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 86: 601-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, neither the influence of the 5′-flanking nucleotides for CAR-RXR heterodimer binding nor the possibility of CAR monomer binding has been addressed. In this study, the functional profile of CAR-RXR heterodimers in relation to CAR monomers was investigated. We found that CAR preferentially binds as a heterodimer with RXR to DR4- and ER8-type REs. Surprisingly, we also observed CAR-DNA monomer complexes even in the presence of RXR. CAR monomers and heterodimers showed to interact with coactivator and corepressor proteins. Moreover, we observed that both CAR monomers and CAR-RXR heterodimers have preferences for the dinucleotide that flank the 5′ of the hexameric DNA binding sites. These preferences were mediated by amino acids Arg-90 and Arg-91 of the carboxyl-terminal extension of the DBD. Finally, we indicate a possible physiological role for CAR monomers contributing to the functionality of human UGT1A1 gene promoter PBREM.

The point mutants of RXR and human CAR were generated using the QuickChange point mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and confirmed by sequencing. The helix 12 deletion mutants of RXR and human CAR were created by introducing a stop codon at amino acid positions 444 and 342, respectively, in the proteins. The same constructs were used for both T7 RNA polymerase-driven in vitro transcription/translation of the respective cDNAs and for viral promoter-driven overexpression of the respective proteins in mammalian cells.

All 35 constructs were verified by sequencing. The core sequences of the REs are indicated in Figs. 2 and 6 and Table I.Fig. 6Contribution of CAR heterodimers and monomers to the activity of the UGT1A1 promoter PBREM. The sequence of the PBREM of the UGT1A1 gene with the three CAR binding sites RE1, RE2, and RE3 is indicated above. A, gel shift experiments were performed with in vitro translated human CAR (hCAR) and human RXR (hRXR) protein and 32P-labeled RE1, RE2, and RE3. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved from free probe through 8% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels. Representative gels are shown. The percentage of protein-complexed DNA (in relation to maximal binding of CAR-RXR heterodimers to RE1) was quantified using a Fuji FLA-3000 reader. NS indicates nonspecific complexes. Reporter gene assays were performed with extracts from MCF-7 cells that were transiently transfected with a luciferase reporter construct containing the indicated dimeric and monomeric REs and an expression vector for human CAR.

Open table in a new tab In vitro translated human proteins were generated by coupled in vitro transcription/translation using rabbit reticulocyte lysate as recommended by the supplier (Promega, Madison, WI). Protein batches were quantified by test translations in the presence of [35S]methionine. The specific concentration of the receptor proteins was adjusted to ∼4 ng/μl (10 ng corresponds to approximately to 0.2 pmol) after taking the individual number of methionine residues per protein into account. Bacterial overexpression of GST, GST-TIF2-(646–926), and GST-NCoR-(1679–2453) was obtained from the Escherichia coli BL21-(DE3)pLysS strain (Stratagene) containing the respective expression plasmids. GST and GST-TIF2-(646–926) fusion protein expression were stimulated with 0.25 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C and GST-NCoR-(1679–2453) expression was induced with 1.25 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 5 h at 25 °C. Proteins were purified and immobilized by glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol and were eluted in the presence of excess glutathione. Gel shift assays were performed with standard (∼10 ng) or the indicated amounts of the appropriate in vitro translated proteins. The proteins were incubated for 15 min in a total volume of 20 μl of binding buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 μg/μl poly(dI-dC), and 5% glycerol). For supershift experiments 3 μg of bacterially expressed GST, GST-TIF2-(646–926), and GST-NCoR-(1679–2453) proteins were added to the reaction mixture. Constant amounts (1 ng) of 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides (50,000 cpm) corresponding to one copy of a monomeric or dimeric RE (for core sequences see Figs. 1, 2, and 6) were then added and incubation was continued for 20 min at room temperature. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved by electrophoresis through 8% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels in 0.5× TBE (45 mm Tris, 45 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.3) and quantified on a Fuji FLA-3000 reader (Tokyo, Japan) using Image Gauge software (Fuji). GST pull-down assay were performed with 50 μl of a 50% Sepharose bead slurry GST-TIF2-(646–926) or GST-NCoR-(1679–2453) (preblocked with 1 μg/μl bovine serum albumin) and 20 ng in vitro translated 35S-labeled NRs. Proteins were incubated in immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 200 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothretiol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 10% glycerol) for 20 min at 30 °C. In vitro translated proteins that were not bound to GST fusion proteins were washed away with immunoprecipitation buffer. GST fusion protein-bound 35S-labeled NRs were resolved by electrophoresis through 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and quantified on a Fuji FLA-3000 reader using Image Gauge software. MCF-7 human breast cancer cells were seeded into 6-well plates (105 cells/ml) and grown overnight in phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum. Plasmid DNA containing liposomes were formed by incubating 1 μg of a reporter plasmid and 1 μg of expression vectors for human CAR with 10 μg of DOTAP (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) for 15 min at room temperature in a total volume of 100 μl. After dilution with 900 μl of phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, the liposomes were added to the cells. Phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 500 μl of 15% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum was added 4 h after transfection. At this time, either solvent, 10 μm 5β-pregnane-3,20-dione (Steraloids, Newport, RI), 10 μm CITCO (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA), or 10 μm 5α-androstan-3α-ol (Steraloids) were also added. The cells were lysed 16 h after onset of stimulation using the reporter gene lysis buffer (Roche Diagnostics) and the constant light signal luciferase reporter gene assay was performed as recommended by the supplier (Canberra-Packard, Groningen, The Netherlands). The high amino acid sequence identity (54.5%) between the DBDs of human T3Rβ and human CAR allowed to use the crystal structure of hT3Rβ-hRXRα (Protein Data Bank number 2nll, Ref. 22Rastinejad F. Perlmann T. Evans R.M. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1995; 375: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar) as a template for a human CAR-human RXR model. A molecular surface model was produced by the MSMS package (34Sanner M.F. Olson A.J. Spehner J.C. Biopolymers. 1996; 38: 305-320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is included in the CHIMERA program package (35Huang C.C. Couch G.S. Pettersen E.F. Ferrin T.E. Pac. Symp. Biocomput. 1996; 1: 724Google Scholar). The visual model building was done with Xtalview (36McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 155-165Crossref Scopus (2020) Google Scholar). All the non-conserved amino acid side chains were built up following as close as possible the information of the hT3Rβ template. To determine the multiple DNA complex formation abilities of CAR, gel shift experiments were performed using equal molar quantities (0.2 pmol or ∼10 ng) of in vitro translated human CAR (hCAR) and human RXRα (hRXR) protein on DR1–DR6- and ER1–ER10-type REs (Fig. 1). The DR4-type element, which is a perfect repeat of two AGTTCA motifs (DR4(T/T)) and was originally derived from the enhancer of the rat pit-1 gene (37Rhodes S.J. Chen R. DiMattia G.E. Scully K.M. Kalla K.A. Lin S.-C. Yu V.C. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 913-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), served as the prototype RE for the other elements. The highest amount of complex formation was observed on the DR4-type RE, followed by the DR5-type RE. In contrast, less than 20% of maximal CAR-RXR complex formation was observed on the DRs with 1–3 and 6 nucleotide spacing. On ER-type REs CAR-RXR heterodimers exhibited a less stringent spacer specificity with the most efficient binding being observed on the ER8-type RE (∼75% of that on DR4(T/T)). This was followed by the ER7-type RE (60%), the ER6- and ER9-type REs (both 50%), the ER10-type RE (40%), and the ER5-type RE (20%). ER-type REs with a spacer of four or less nucleotides displayed below 10% of maximal CAR-RXR heterodimer complex formation. Interestingly, even in the presence of RXR a small amount of human CAR protein was found to bind as a monomer to each of the DR- and ER-type REs. To analyze the competence of human and mouse CAR in complex formation with DNA both as a heterodimer (with RXR) and as a monomer, further gel shift experiments were performed (Fig. 2). 10 or 20 ng of in vitro translated human and mouse CAR were incubated in the presence of 0, 2.5, and 10 ng RXR. These mixtures were probed with dimeric DR4-type and monomeric REs carrying either AGTTCA (DR4(T/T) and monomer(T)AG) or AGGTCA (DR4(G/G) and monomer(G)AG) hexameric core sequences. On DR4(T/T) only human CAR was found to bind as a monomer in the presence of RXR (Fig. 2A). In contrast, in the absence of the heterodimeric partner both human and mouse CAR showed reasonable amounts of binding to both monomeric and dimeric REs. Monomers as well as heterodimers also formed on REs containing AGGTCA motifs (Fig. 2B). These CAR monomer complexes were ∼10-fold weaker than on REs with AGTTCA motifs (Fig. 2A). Neither CAR homodimer formation nor the independent binding of two CAR monomers was observed on the DR4-type REs. The latter statement was confirmed further by supershift experiments (see Fig. 4B). Taken together, both human and mouse CAR were able to bind as a monomer to DNA and this was dependent on RXR concentration and hexameric motif sequence. To compare the monomer and heterodimer formation ability of CAR with other members of the NR superfamily, gel shift experiments were performed with equal amounts of in vitro translated human CAR and chicken T3Rα in the presence or absence of human RXRα on DR4-, ER7-, and ER8-type REs carrying either AGTTCA (Fig. 3A) or AGGTCA motifs (Fig. 3B). The complex formation of CAR-RXR heterodimers on the REs DR4(T/T), ER7(T/T), and ER8(T/T) was more effective than that of T3R-RXR heterodimers. Furthermore, CAR monomers but not T3R monomers were observed on these REs (Fig. 3A). In contrast, on the REs DR4(G/G), ER7(G/G), and ER8(G/G) the comple"

We analyzed targeting and integration of Tom5, a C-tail anchor protein associated with the preprotein translocase of the outer membrane, to the yeast mitochondrial outer membrane in vivo using green fluorescent protein as the reporter and compared the signal with other signals for proteins dispersed in the membrane. The functional assembly of Tom5 into the TOM complex was assessed by blue native PAGE and complementation of temperature-sensitive Δtom5 cells. Correct targeting and assembly required (i) an appropriate length TMS rather than hydrophobicity, (ii) a proline residue located at correct position in the TMS and specific residues near the proline, and (iii) that, in contrast to proteins dispersed in the outer membrane, the positive C-terminal segment was dispensable. Based on these findings, we constructed green fluorescent protein fusions with a C-terminal TMS in which the deduced sequences (minimum: Ser-Pro-Met) were inserted at an appropriate position within artificial Leu-Ala repeats.

The N-terminal TMS with moderate hydrophobicity and a net positive charge within five residues of the C-terminally flanking region function as the mitochondrial targeting signal of Tom20 (8Kanaji S. Iwahashi J. Kida Y. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 277-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). As for tail-anchored proteins, we used yeast Tom5 and mammalian OMP25 to demonstrate that the moderate length and helical structure of the TMS and the positive charges in the C-terminal segment (C-segment) following the TMS are critical for targeting to mammalian mitochondria (11Horie C. Suzuki H. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1615-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). This signal functions only at the C terminus of the reporter protein. In mammalian cells, yeast Tom5 was not integrated into the TOM complex and behaved as a tail-anchored protein that is dispersed in the membranes. Similarly, Isenmann and Wattenberg (4Isenmann S. Wattenberg B.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998.; 9: 1649-1660Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) demonstrated that mitochondrial localization of VAMP-1B is determined by the C-terminal positive charge and the length of the TMS in cultured mammalian cells. Kuroda and Ito (31Kuroda K. Ito A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31097-31102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and Borgese et al. (9Borgese N. Gazzoni I. Barberi M. Colombo S. Pedrazzini E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2482-2496Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) also demonstrated that basic amino acid residues at the C-terminal tail are critical for correct targeting of mitochondrial outer membrane cytochrome b 5. Systematic analysis of the targeting signal for tail-anchored proteins to mammalian mitochondria using yeast Tom5 and mammalian Omp25 indicated that the basic C-segment of Tom5, which is essential for mitochondrial targeting in mammalian cells, is dispensable in yeast. In the present study, we analyzed the characteristics of the mitochondrial-targeting signal of Tom5 in yeast cells by examining intracellular localization, assembly into the TOM complex, and the ability to complement temperature-sensitive (ts) Δtom5 cells. These experiments revealed that the C-segment is dispensable, but a TMS with an appropriate length (17–20 residues), rather than hydrophobicity, is critical for the targeting and functional assembly into the TOM complex. In particular, a short segment containing a proline and the adjacent residues in the TMS was critical for the targeting. Unexpectedly, the TMS of Tom5 fused to the C terminus of GFP was assembled into the TOM complex and complemented the ts growth phenotype of Δtom5 cells. Thus, mitochondrial targeting of tail-anchored proteins destined for the TOM complex depends on a signal distinct from that of proteins that are dispersed in the membrane. The structural characteristics of the targeting signal of Tom5 might be directly recognized by Tom40 in this targeting pathway. Based on the deduced structural characteristics of the Tom5 signal, model Leu-Ala repeats containing a stretch of proline 39 and the vicinity residues (minimum: Ser-Pro-Met) were synthesized and ligated to the C terminus of GFP. These constructs were targeted to the mitochondria and complemented ts Δtom5 cells, although the integration efficiency into the TOM complex was low. In vitro import of GFP-Tom5 into mitochondria as assessed by blue native (BN)-PAGE revealed that it did not require the general import pore (GIP) during the assembly process but appeared to bind directly to the exterior of the Tom40 channel. Yeast Strains and Media—The Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain SEY6210 (MATα leu2-3, 112 ura3-52 his3Δ200 trp1-Δ901 lys2-801 suc2-Δ 9 GAL+) was used throughout the study. Yeast cells were grown at 30 °C on rich medium (YPD: 2% glucose, 2% bacto-trypton (Difco), 1% Bacto-Yeast extract (Difco)). Transformants were grown on synthetic glucose medium (SD: 2% glucose, 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (Difco), and appropriate amino acids] selective for a plasmid-borne marker, e.g. SD-His for His3-harboring plasmids. TOM5 (797552–797704 on chromosome XVI) was replaced with Candida glabrea HIS3 using a PCR-assisted disruption protocol. Plasmid Construction—Construction of expression plasmids for enhanced GFP (EGFP) fusion proteins were based on the 2μ plasmid Yeplac112 (32Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (2528) Google Scholar). The PstI/EcoRI sites in Yeplac112 were disrupted, and the ADC1 promoter and CYC1 terminator were subcloned into SphI/EcoRI and EcoRI/HindIII sites, respectively, to create pMID-2. To construct pMID2-EGFP-Tom5, an XbaI/ApaI site was created at the EcoRI site of pMID2, into which an EGFP-Tom5 fragment that was excised from pRc/CMV EGFP-Tom5 by XbaI-ApaI was cloned. To construct pMID2-EGFP-Tom5 derivatives, pRC/CMV plasmids harboring EGFP-Tom5 mutants (11Horie C. Suzuki H. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1615-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) were digested with XbaI and ApaI, and the obtained fragments were inserted into pMID2. To create pMID2-EGFP-Tom6, the 186-bp DNA fragment corresponding to the Tom6 ORF (full-length, 62 residues) was amplified from genomic DNA by PCR using the following primers: 5′-AAGCCGCGGATGGACGGTATGTTTGCT-3′ (for the N terminus) and 5′-ATAGGGCCCTTATAATTGTGGGGCCAA-3′ (for the C terminus) and cloned into the SacII/ApaI site of pMID2-EGFP. To create pMID2-EGFP-Fis1, the 108-bp DNA fragment of Fis1p (residues 181–216) was amplified from genomic DNA using oligonucleotides: 5′-AAGCCGCGGGAGGATAAGAYCCAGAAG-3′ (for the N terminus) and 5′-ATAGGGCCCTTACCTTCTCTTGTTTCT-3′ (for the C terminus) and cloned into pMD-EGFP. To construct pMID2-EGFP-Ufe1, the DNA fragment (residues 314–346) was amplified from genomic DNA using the following oligonucleotides 5′-CAAGCCGCGGGCGAAACGAGCTGCTGGAAGA-3′ (for the N terminus) and 5′-ATAGGGCCCTTAACCTACATAATCTAGGAA-3′ (for the C terminus), and the fragment was cloned into pMD-EGFP. To create pSD-SuU9 (69)-RFP, the N-terminal 69 residues of preSU9 of F0-ATPase subunit 9 were ligated on the DNA level to the N terminus of DsRed (RFP) obtained from pDsRed2-N1 (Clontech), and the fragment was cloned into pMID2. Subcellular Fractionation—Subcellular fractionation of yeast cells was performed as follows. Yeast cells (SEY6210) were transformed with pMID2-based vectors using a lithium acetate-based method and grown in SD medium without tryptophan at 30 °C to an A 600 of 1.0. The cells were harvested and treated with zymolyase 100T (Seikagku America, Falmouth, MA). The spheroplasts obtained were homogenized using a polycarbonate filter (3-μm pores; Nucleopore, Corning, NY). The homogenate was fractionated by differential centrifugation into P1 (6000 × g, 10 min precipitate: mitochondria-rich fraction), P2 (100000 × g, 30 min: microsomal fraction), and the supernatant according to the method of Daum et al. (33Daum G. Böhni P.C. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13028-13033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The subcellular fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. The immunoblots were visualized by ECL (Amersham Biosciences), and the images were analyzed by LAS-1000 plus (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan). Blue Native PAGE—BN-PAGE was performed essentially as described previously (34Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1917) Google Scholar). Mitochondria were isolated from yeast cells expressing the GFP-Tom5 or the GFP-Fis1 constructs by the method described above and subjected to one-dimensional BN-PAGE as described previously (11Horie C. Suzuki H. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1615-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The gels were subjected to immunoblotting using antibodies against EGFP (35Miyazaki E. Sakaguchi M. Wakabayashi S. Shigekawa M. Mihara K. J. Biol.

Complementation of ts Phenotype of Δtom5 Yeast Cells—Δtom5 yeast cells transformed with various pMID2-based vectors were grown overnight at 30 °C in SD (–His, –Trp) liquid culture medium. The cells grown to an A 600 of 1.0 were diluted 5-, 25-, or 125-fold, and 5-μl aliquots from each dilution were plated onto two SD (–His, –Trp) plates, which were incubated at either 30 or 37 °C for 2 days. Fluorescence Microscopy—Yeast cells were co-transformed with pMD-SU9-RFP- and pMID2-based expression plasmids for GFP-Tom5 fusions or other GFP fusions. The cells were grown on YPD medium to log phase at 30 °C and then incubated with 3.7 to 5% (w/v) formaldehyde at 30 °C for 30 min. The cells were isolated by centrifugation and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline by centrifugation, suspended into VECTASHIELD (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA), and placed on glass slides. Fluorescent images were taken and analyzed with a confocal laser microscope (Radiance 2000; Bio-Rad) using fluorescence images of SU9-RFP as the mitochondrial reference. Mitochondrial Import of Preproteins in Vitro—Yeast mitochondria were isolated as described previously (37Mihara K. Blobel G. Sato R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 7102-7106Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial import of reticulocyte lysate-synthesized preproteins (preadrenodoxin, porin, or GFP-Tom5) was performed essentially as described previously (36Suzuki H. Okazawa Y Komiya T. Saeki K. Mekada E. Kitada S. Ito A. Mihara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37930-37936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), except that 5 mm methionine, 5 mm creatine phosphate, and 100 μg/ml creatine kinase were added to the assay mixture. Where indicated, the mitochondria that were incubated with 1 μm SU9-DHFR at 0 °C for 15 min in the presence of 5 mm methotrexate and 1 mm NADPH were used for the import reaction. Membrane integration of 35S-porin was assessed as follows. After import, the mitochondria were treated with 50 μg/ml proteinase K at 0 °C for 30 min, trichloroacetic acid-precipitated, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Membrane integration of GFP-Tom5 was assessed as follows. After import, the mitochondria were incubated with 0.1 m Na2CO3 (pH 11.5) at 0 °C for 20 min, followed by ultracentrifugation to recover the membrane precipitates. The membranes were treated again with 0.1 m Na2CO3 and subjected to SDS-PAGE. GFP-Tom5 was not recovered to the precipitate fraction in the absence of the membranes (data not shown). Analysis of the in vitro imported 35S-preproteins by BN-PAGE was as follows. After import, the mitochondria were solubilized in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 1% digitonin, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The solubilized supernatant was subjected to one-dimensional BN-PAGE (5–16% gradient gel) followed by fluoroimage analysis using an FLA2000 (Fuji). Where indicated, mitochondria (10 μg) were pretreated with 100 μg/ml trypsin or proteinase K at 0 °C for 30 min, followed by incubation either with soybean trypsin inhibitor or phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to inhibit proteases. The recovered mitochondria were subjected to the import reaction. Mitochondrial Localization of GFP-Tom5 in Yeast Depends on a Signal Distinct from That for Tail-anchored Proteins Dispersed in the Membrane—We previously analyzed the signal that directs tail-anchored proteins to mammalian mitochondria using yeast Tom5 as a model. These experiments revealed that a TMS with an appropriate length and three basic amino acid residues within the flanking five-residue segment (the C-segment) are critical. Of note, yeast Tom5 was not assembled into the mammalian TOM complex but dispersed in the membrane (11Horie C. Suzuki H. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1615-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The signal of Omp25, a tail-anchored protein of the mammalian mitochondrial outer membrane had the same characteristics (11Horie C. Suzuki H. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1615-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Because Tom5 is firmly associated with the TOM core complex in yeast (21Dietmeier K. Hönlinger A. Bömer U. Dekker P.J.T. Eckerskorn C. Lottspeich F Kübrich M. Pfanner N. Nature. 1997; 388: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), we analyzed the signal responsible for targeting and integration of yeast Tom5 to yeast mitochondria. We constructed GFP-Tom5 fusions in which deletions, insertions, or point mutations were introduced to the TMS or the C-segment, expressed in yeast, and examined the intracellular localization by confocal microscopy and subcellular fractionation (Fig. 1). Mitochondria in yeast and COS-7 cells were stained with a RFP fusion protein carrying an N-terminal mitochondrial-targeting signal (SU9-RFP) and MitoTracker, respectively. The expressed GFP-Tom5 localized to mitochondria in both cells (Fig. 1B). This finding was further confirmed by subcellular fractionation (Fig. 1C). We then examined the importance of the C-segment using constructs in which three basic residues were replaced by serine residues (K-S) (Fig. 1A). GFP-Tom5(K-S) was dispersed throughout the membranes in COS-7 cells (Fig. 1B), confirming our previous finding. In yeast cells, it was unexpectedly correctly localized to mitochondria (Fig. 1, B and C), indicating that the basic C-segment is dispensable for correct targeting in yeast. The TMS-deleted construct GFP-Tom5(ΔTM) localized to the cytosol (Figs. 1C and 2B). BN-PAGE indicated that GFP-Tom5(K-S) was efficiently integrated into the ∼400-kDa TOM complex (Fig. 1D). Furthermore, GFP-Tom5 constructs (wild type and K-S) but not GFP-TOM5(ΔTM) complemented the ts growth defect of Δtom5 yeast cells (Fig. 1E). The C-segment-deleted mutant GFP-Tom5(ΔC) showed the same phenotype as GFP-Tom5(K-S) (data not shown). Thus, correct targeting and functional integration of Tom5 into the yeast TOM complex does not require the basic C-segment.Fig. 2TMS length, rather than hydrophobicity, is critical for the mitochondrial targeting. A, schematic representation of the TMS-elongated GFP-Tom5 fusion constructs. B, intracellular localization in yeast of GFP-Tom5 constructs in which valine residues were inserted in the TMS or hydrophobicity of the TMS was increased by partial replacement of the N- and C-terminal regions with valine and leucine residues, respectively. The results of confocal microscopy are shown. ER was located by immunostaining using anti-Kar2p antibodies. TM(+5V) mostly localized to the ER, although a small fraction was presumably transported further to the downstream secretory organelles of dot-like structures. C, subcellular localization of the GFP-Tom5 constructs as revealed by immunoblotting. D, complementation of ts growth of Δtom5 cells. E, assembly of GFP-Tom5 fusions into the TOM complex as revealed by BN-PAGE. Other conditions were as described in Fig. 1 and “Experimental Procedures.” WT, wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We then examined the targeting properties of yeast Fis1, a tail-anchored outer membrane protein that is dispersed in the membrane. Fis1p is anchored to the mitochondrial outer membrane through a 20-amino acid C-terminal TMS followed by a 5-residue C-segment with four basic charges (Fig. 1A). Fis1p functions in conjunction with a peripheral protein, Mdv1p, and a cytosolic dynamin-like protein, Dnm1p, to regulate mitochondrial fission reactions (38Shaw J.M. Nunnari J. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 178-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Expression of GFP-Fis1 in yeast cells localized to the mitochondria, whereas the C-segment mutant (GFP-Fis1(K,R-S)) was mistargeted to the ER and cofractionated with Kar2p (Fig. 1, B and C; during cell fractionation the ER-targeted construct was somehow cleaved, and the fragment was released to the cytosol (asterisk)), thus confirming, also in yeast, the importance of the basic C-segment for mitochondrial targeting of the membrane-dispersed tail-anchored proteins. GFP-Fis1 failed to assemble into the TOM complex (Fig. 1D) and to complement the ts growth defect of the Δtom5 yeast cells (Fig. 3C). These results indicated that the mitochondrial-targeting signal of Tom5 is clearly distinct from the signal of tail-anchored proteins dispersed in the outer membrane. Length of TMS Rather Than Hydrophobicity Is Critical for Targeting and Integration of GFP-Tom5 Fusions to the TOM Complex—We then examined the importance of TMS for the functional targeting of GFP-Tom5. TM(+1V), in which the TMS was elongated by a valine residue, localized to the mitochondria, whereas TM(+3V) and TM(+5V) were targeted mainly to the ER as judged by co-localization with Kar2p and cell fractionation (Fig. 2, A–C). TM(+1V) complemented the ts growth defect of Δtom5 cells (Fig. 2D). TM(+2V) localized to the mitochondria (Fig. 2, B and C), although it failed to complement the ts growth defect of Δtom5 yeast cells (Fig. 2D), indicating that the length of TMS is critical for association with the TOM complex. BN-PAGE was used to confirm that TM(+2V) was not assembled into the TOM complex (Fig. 2E). Furthermore, the C-segment mutant TM(+2V)/K-S, in which positive charges were depleted, localized to the ER (Fig. 2, B and C), consistent with previous results. Together, these results indicate the presence of two targeting pathways for mitochondrial tail-anchored proteins: the C-segment-dependent and -independent pathways. We then examined the effect of hydrophobicity in the TMS on mitochondrial targeting. The N- and C-terminal segments of the TMS of GFP-Tom5 were replaced by valine and leucine residues to increase hydrophobicity without changing the length ((TM(VL)) (Fig. 2A). This manipulation increased the average hydrophobicity from 1.28 to 2.44. It did not affect mitochondrial-targeting of the fusion construct (Fig. 2, B and C), and the construct assembled into the TOM complex and complemented the ts growth defect of the Δtom5 yeast cells (Fig. 2, D and E). These results indicated that the length of TMS rather than hydrophobicity is critical for correct targeting. Proline 39 in the TMS Is Critical for Functional Targeting of Tom5—Allen et al. (39Allen R. Egan B. Gabriel K. Beilharz T. Lithgow T. FEBS Lett. 2002; 514: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) demonstrated that a conserved proline residue present in the TMS of yeast mitochondrial tail-anchored proteins, such as Tom5, Tom6, Tom7, and Tom22 is required for targeting to the outer membrane. We analyzed this in more detail with GFP-Tom5 mutants carrying deletions within the TMS (summarized in Table I). Single deletions within residues 43–45 did not affect localization of the constructs. The same was true for residues 30–36 and 38. In contrast, deletion of either of residues 37, 40, 41, or 42 decreased targeting fidelity and induced partial mislocalization of the constructs to the cytosol. Most dramatically, deletion of the proline at residue 39 induced complete mislocalization of the construct (GFP-Tom5(Δ39P)) to the ER. It also failed to complement the ts growth defect of the Δtom5 cells (Table I). Similar results were obtained with the mutant in which proline 39 was replaced by leucine (GFP-Tom5(P39L)); it mislocalized to dot-like structures that probably represent secretory organelles and, therefore, failed to complement the ts growth defect of the Δtom5 cells (data not shown). The other GFP-Tom5 constructs with a single-residue deletion in residues 40–45 complemented the ts growth defect of the Δtom5 cells (Table I), of which Δ44–45 and Δ44L were confirmed to be integrated into the TOM complex (data not shown). The constructs carrying a single residue-deletion within residues 30–38 were targeted to the mitochondria. Deletions within residues 35–38 compromised the complementation activity of GFP-Tom5, whereas those within the N-terminal periphery of the TMS (residues 30–34) did not (Table I). Neither the complementation activity nor the mitochondria-targeting function was compromised"

The inner membrane retention signal, Asp at position 2 in combination with certain residues at position 3, functions as a Lol avoidance signal, i.e. the signal inhibits the recognition of lipoproteins by LolCDE that releases lipoproteins from the inner membrane. To understand the role of the residue at position 2, outer membrane-specific lipoproteins with Cys at position 2 were subjected to chemical modification followed by the release reaction in reconstituted proteoliposomes. Sulfhydryl-specific introduction of nonprotein molecules or a negative charge to Cys did not inhibit the LolCDE-dependent release. In contrast, oxidation of Cys to cysteic acid resulted in generation of the Lol avoidance signal, indicating that the Lol avoidance signal requires a critical length of negative charge at the second residue. Furthermore, not only modification of the carboxylic acid of Asp at position 2 but also that of the amine of phosphatidylethanolamine abolished the Lol avoidance function. Based on these results, the Lol avoidance mechanism is discussed. Escherichia coli lipoproteins are localized to either the inner or outer membrane depending on the residue at position 2.

Biomembr. 1990; 22: 451-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 2Pugsley A.P. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 50-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent processing to mature lipoproteins occurs on the periplasmic side of the inner membrane. The N-terminal Cys of mature lipoproteins is modified by thioether-linked diacylglycerol and amino-linked acyl chain (3Sankaran K. Wu H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19701-19706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli, lipoproteins are anchored through N-terminal lipids to the periplasmic leaflet of either the inner or outer membrane. It has been proposed that Asp at position 2 makes lipoproteins specific to the inner membrane, whereas other residues direct lipoproteins to the outer membrane (4Yamaguchi K. Fujio Y. Inouye M. Cell. 1988; 53: 423-432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). We recently revealed that the inner membrane retention of lipoproteins is determined by Asp at position 2 but also affected by the residue at position 3 (5Terada M. Kuroda T. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47690-47694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Thus, strong inner membrane retention occurs with Asp at position 2 and Asp, Glu, Gln, or Asn at position 3. Other residues at position 3 decrease the inner membrane retention of lipoproteins to various extents depending on the species. Importantly, E. coli native lipoproteins specific to the inner membrane only utilize these strong inner membrane signals (5Terada M. Kuroda T. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47690-47694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The Lol system, which is composed of five Lol proteins, is involved in the sorting and outer membrane localization of lipoproteins. The LolCDE complex in the inner membrane belongs to the ATP-binding cassette transporter superfamily and comprises two copies of an ATPase subunit, LolD, and one copy each of the integral membrane subunits LolC and LolE. This complex releases outer membrane-directed lipoproteins from the inner membrane in an ATP-dependent manner (6Yakushi T. Yokota N. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32576-32581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 7Yakushi T. Masuda K. Narita S. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. Nat.

Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 1417-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), leading to the formation of a water-soluble complex comprising one molecule each of lipoprotein and LolA in the periplasm (9Matsuyama S. Tajima T. Tokuda H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3365-3372Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 10Tajima T. Yokota N. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 51-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The LolA-lipoprotein complex then interacts with outer membrane receptor LolB, which catalyzes the anchoring of lipoproteins to the outer membrane (11Matsuyama S. Yokota N. Tokuda H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6947-6955Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 12Tanaka K. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 6538-6542Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of LolA and LolB are very similar to each other despite the fact that their amino acid sequences are dissimilar (13Takeda K. Miyatake H. Yokota N. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. Miki K. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3199-3209Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The inner membrane retention signal functions as a Lol avoidance signal and inhibits the recognition of lipoproteins by LolCDE, thereby causing the retention of lipoproteins in the inner membrane (14Masuda K. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7390-7395Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The Lol avoidance is not caused by a difference in the mode of lipid modification between inner membrane-specific and outer membrane-specific lipoproteins (15Fukuda A. Matsuyama S. Hara T. Nakayama J. Nagasawa H. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43512-43518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). A LolC mutant, LolC(A40P), that releases lipoproteins possessing the Lol avoidance signal was recently isolated (16Narita S. Kanamaru K. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 167-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Because both LolA and LolB could interact with inner membrane-specific lipoproteins released by the mutant LolCDE complex, the inner membrane retention signal was found to only function against LolCDE. However, it remains to be clarified why Asp at position 2 has such a specific function. To clarify critical properties required for the Lol avoidance signal, the second residue of lipoproteins was chemically modified, and the release of the modified lipoproteins was examined in proteoliposomes reconstituted with E. coli phospholipids and LolCDE. Here we show that the distance between Cα and the negative charge of the second residue is critical for the Lol avoidance signal. Furthermore, phosphatidylethanolamine was found to be essential for the Lol avoidance mechanism. Materials—Globomycin was a kind gift from Masatoshi Inukai (Sankyo Co.).

Construction of Pal Derivatives—To construct plasmids encoding His-tagged Pal(2C), Pal(3C), and Pal(4C) having a single Cys at positions 2, 3, and 4, respectively, under the control of tacPO and lacIq , pTPH21 was mutagenized using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with a specified pair of PCR primers (Table I). To construct plasmids encoding Pal(2D), Pal(2D3C), Pal(2D3D4C), and Pal(2C3D) under the control of tacPO and lacIq , pTPH21 was digested with SalI and HindIII, followed by Klenow enzyme to make the ends blunt, and then subjected to self-ligation.

The gene for the designed lipoprotein was inserted into the EcoRI-HindIII site of pTTQ18 (Amersham Biosciences) under the control of tacPO and lacIq. However, expression of the initially designed lipoprotein was very poor. To improve the expression, synthetic oligonucleotides containing random codons except those for Asp and Glu were inserted into the mature region. The plasmids thus constructed were transformed into JM83, and then the expression of lipoproteins was examined. A plasmid, pTHSCLP(SS), was isolated from the clone that expressed the highest amount of SCLP(SS). To construct pTHSCLP(DQ), pTHSCLP(SS) was mutated so as to have Asp and Gln at the N-terminal second and third positions of the mature region, respectively. The nucleotide sequence of the inserts at the EcoRI-HindIII site of pTTQ18 was found to be GAATTCAATAGTAAAGGAATCATTGAAATGCAACTGAACAAAGTGCTGAAAGGGCTGATGATTGCTCTGCCTGTTATGGCAATTGCGGCATGTTCTTCC(GACCAG)TCCTCCTCGAGCACACTGACTCCCCCGGGAGCAGCTATCGTGGCGGTAGTCGTCATCAACGGCGGCAACGGCAACATGCGACTCCCCCCAACAAGCCCCACAGTTGTACCCCCACCTATACGTCTGCAGATGGCTTCTATGACTGGTGGTCAGCAAATGGGTCATCATCATCATCATCATTAAGCTT, in which the start and stop codons are underlined and the codons for the second and third residues of SCLP(SS) are italicized, with the mutated sequence of SCLP(DQ) in parenthesis. The deduced amino acid sequences of proSCLP(SS) and proSCLP(DQ) encoded by pTHSCLP(SS) and pTHSCLP(DQ), respectively, are shown in Fig. 3A. Preparation of Proteins and Antibodies—The LolCDE complex was overproduced in JM83 harboring pKM301 and pKM402 as reported (14Masuda K. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7390-7395Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Pal derivatives SCLP(SS) and SCLP(DQ) were overproduced in JM83 cells harboring the respective plasmids. These His-tagged proteins were purified with a metal-chelating resin as reported (15Fukuda A. Matsuyama S. Hara T. Nakayama J. Nagasawa H. Tokuda H. J. Biol.

LolCDE was kept at -80 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 2 mm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5% sucrose monocaprate. Pal derivatives were kept at -80 °C in 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5) containing 2% sucrose monocaprate and 1 mm TCEP at 2 mg/ml. SCLP(SS) and SCLP(DQ) were kept in 0.1 m MES-NaOH (pH 5.0) containing 2% octylglucoside. LolA was purified as reported (9Matsuyama S. Tajima T. Tokuda H.

Release of Lipoproteins from Reconstituted Proteoliposomes—The reported method (14Masuda K. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7390-7395Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) was slightly modified. E. coli phospholipids (0.8 mg) and LolCDE (8 μg) were incubated on ice for 10 min in 0.1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 2 mm MgSO4, 0.5 mm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1.2% sucrose monocaprate. The mixture was diluted 10-fold with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 5 mm MgSO4 and 0.1 m NaCl and then dialyzed overnight against 500 ml of the dilution buffer. The reconstituted proteolipomes were collected by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 2 h and resuspended in 0.1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 5 mm MgSO4, 0.1 m NaCl, 2 mm ATP, and 1 mm TCEP. After freezing-thawing-sonication, the proteoliposome suspension was mixed with 1 μl of a solution containing the indicated lipoprotein (2 μg), followed by standing on ice for 30 min to allow anchoring of lipoproteins to proteoliposomal membranes. Proteoliposomes were collected and resuspended in 0.1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 5 mm MgSO4, 0.1 m NaCl, 2 mm ATP, and 1 mm TCEP. Because of technical difficulties in preparing a concentrated solution, SCLP(SS) and SCLP(DQ) were reconstituted into proteoliposomes together with LolCDE. The release of lipoproteins from reconstituted proteoliposomes was examined as reported (7Yakushi T. Masuda K. Narita S. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 212-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The proteoliposome suspension (50 μl) obtained above was mixed with 250 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 5 mm MgSO4, 0.1 m NaCl, 2 mm ATP, 1 mm TCEP, and 1 μg of LolA, followed by incubation at 30 °C for 20 min. After fractionation into proteoliposomes and the supernatant, the lipoproteins in each fraction were determined by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with specified antibodies or avidin-HRP. Unless otherwise specified, one-tenth of the pellet materials was applied to the gel. Chemical Modification of Lipoproteins and Phospholipids—Unless otherwise specified, SH-specific modification of lipoproteins was performed with 1 mm maleimide biotin, iodoacetyl biotin, or AMS at 30 °C for 2 h. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 150 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and the modified lipoproteins were precipitated with acetone, followed by resuspension in the original solution. For cross-linking of biotin PEO-amine to the carboxylic acid of lipoproteins by means of a cross-linker, EDC, lipoproteins were incubated at 30 °C for 2 h in 100 mm MES-NaOH (pH 5.0) containing 1% octylglucoside, 50 mm EDC, and 10 mm biotin PEO-amine. The reaction mixture was dialyzed against 200 ml of 100 mm MES-NaOH (pH 5.0) containing 1% octylglucoside for 2 h and then 200 ml of 20 mm HEPESNaOH (pH 8.0) containing 2% octylglucoside for 6 h. Oxidation of Cys was performed according to the method of Hirs (21Hirs C.H.W. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 11: 197-199Crossref Scopus (879) Google Scholar). Performic acid was prepared by incubating 950 μl of 99% formic acid with 50 μl of 30% H2O2 for 2 h at room temperature. Lipoproteins (200 μg) were precipitated with acetone, resuspended in a mixture of 10 μlof formic acid and 2 μl of methanol, and then kept at -20 °C for 30 min. Performic acid (200 μl) was added to the lipoprotein suspension, followed by standing at -20 °C for 150 min. After diluting the reaction mixture with ice-cold water, the lipoproteins were precipitated with acetone and then solubilized in 100 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5) containing 2% sucrose monocaprate. E. coli phospholipids (100 mg) in 50 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 8.0) containing 2% octylglucoside were treated with 25 mm SNA for 6 h at 4 °C and then dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm dithiothreitol to terminate the reaction. Other Methods—SDS-PAGE for Pal derivatives and synthetic lipoproteins, SCLP(SS) and SCLP(DQ), was performed according to Laemmli (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar) and Hussain et al. (23Hussain M. Ichihara S. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3707-3712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. Immunoblotting (24Yamada H. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18577-18581Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and subcellular fractionation (11Matsuyama S. Yokota N. Tokuda H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6947-6955Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) were performed as described. SH-specific Modification at Position 2 Does Not Inhibit the LolA- and LolCDE-dependent Release of Lipoproteins—Outer membrane lipoprotein Pal has no Cys residue except for the N-terminal lipid-modified one. Pal(2C), which possesses Cys at position 2 (Table I) and a His6 tag at the C terminus, was constructed and expressed in E. coli. It was previously shown that the His6 tag attachment does not affect lipoprotein sorting (15Fukuda A. Matsuyama S. Hara T. Nakayama J. Nagasawa H. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43512-43518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Membrane localization of Pal(2C) was then examined in vivo. Consistent with our previous in vitro results (5Terada M. Kuroda T. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47690-47694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), Cys at position 2 did not function as the Lol avoidance signal, and Pal(2C) was exclusively localized in the outer membrane (data not shown). Pal(2C) was purified and treated with SH-specific reagents. Modified Pal(2C) was anchored to proteoliposomes reconstituted with LolCDE and then subjected to the release reaction in the presence and absence of LolA (Fig. 1). Surprisingly, introduction of large molecules such as iodoacetyl biotin or AMS did not inhibit the release. Iodoacetyl biotin-treated Pal(2C) released into the supernatant reacted with biotin-specific streptavidin (Fig. 1A, lower panels), confirming the attachment of biotin to the released Pal(2C). Although the results are not shown, the modified Pal(2C) in the supernatant existed as a complex with LolA and was subsequently incorporated into outer membranes in a LolB-dependent manner. Taken together, these results indicate that introduction of nonprotein molecules to the second residue of outer membrane-specific lipoproteins has no effect on their interaction with Lol proteins. Pal(2C) was modified with iodoacetic acid to introduce a negative charge to the second position. However, this also did not inhibit the Pal(2C) release, which was dependent on both LolCDE and LolA (Fig. 1B), whereas Pal(2D) possessing Asp at position 2 was not released from proteoliposomes. It has been reported that Glu at position 2 does not exhibit the Lol avoidance function (5Terada M. Kuroda T. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47690-47694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the introduction of a negative charge alone is not sufficient for conversion of an outer membrane lipoprotein into an inner membrane one. We next examined whether dimerization through a disulfide bond affects the release of Pal(2C). Pal(2C) was either reduced with TCEP or oxidized with potassium ferricyanide and then reconstituted into proteoliposomes. The Pal(2C) dimer was only detected with potassium ferricyanide-treated Pal(2C) (Fig. 1C). The monomeric forms of Pal(wt) and Pal(2C) were released on the addition of LolA, whereas LolA did not induce the release of dimeric Pal(2C), indicating that only the lipoprotein monomer acts as a substrate for the release reaction. Oxidation of Cys at Position 2 Inhibits the Release of Lipoproteins—Because Glu at position 2 does not function as the Lol avoidance signal (5Terada M. Kuroda T. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47690-47694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), it seems possible that the distance between the negative charge and Cα of the main chain is critical for the Lol avoidance signal. To examine this, Cys of Pal(2C) was oxidized with performic acid to generate cysteic acid, of which the Cα-negative charge distance is similar to that of Asp (for details, see Fig. 7). As shown in Fig. 2, the LolA-dependent release of Pal(wt) was not affected by treatment with performic acid. Pal(2D) remained in proteoliposomes after the treatment with performic acid. Strikingly, the release of Pal(2C) was nearly completely inhibited by this treatment. We also oxidized Pal(3C) and Pal(4C), which possess Cys at positions 3 and 4, respectively. Inhibition of the release reaction by performic acid treatment was dependent on the position of Cys; inhibition of the release was significant with Pal(3C) and almost nothing with Pal(4C). These results are consistent with the observation that Asp at position 2 functions as the Lol avoidance signal, whereas that at position 4 does not (25Gennity J.M. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16458-16464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After the performic acid treatment, none of the Pal derivatives possessing Cys formed a disulfide-bonded dimer upon treatment with potassium ferricyanide, indicating that SH was completely converted to sulfonate.Fig. 2Conversion of Cys to cysteic acid inhibits the release of lipoproteins depending on the position of Cys. Pal derivatives were oxidized with performic acid as described under “Experimental Procedures” and then anchored to proteoliposomes reconstituted with LolCDE. The release of Pal derivatives was examined as in Fig. 1A and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-Pal antibodies. One-twentieth of the pellet materials was applied to the gel.

The former has no negative charge except for that of the C-terminal carboxylic acid, whereas the latter has Asp at position 2 followed by Gln, thereby having a strong Lol avoidance signal, DQ (5Terada M. Kuroda T. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47690-47694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Both lipoproteins have T7 and His6 tags at the C termini for their detection and purification. In vivo processing of the SCLP(SS) precursor to the mature form was inhibited by globomycin, an inhibitor of lipoprotein-specific signal peptidase (Fig. 3B). SCLP(SS) was localized in the outer membrane, whereas SCLP(DQ) was exclusively found in the inner membrane (Fig. 3C), indicating that membrane sorting of these synthetic lipoproteins takes place according to the “+2 rule” (4Yamaguchi K. Fujio Y. Inouye M. Cell. 1988; 53: 423-432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). SCLP(SS) and SCLP(DQ) were purified and treated with carboxylate-specific cross-linker EDC in the presence of biotin PEO-amine. After this treatment, both lipoproteins reacted with avidin-HRP, indicating that the C-terminal carboxylate was modified with biotin (data not shown). SCLP(SS) and SCLP(DQ) treated with or without EDC-biotin were reconstituted into proteoliposomes and then subjected to the release reaction (Fig. 4). Whether treated or not treated with EDC-biotin, SCLP(SS) was released from proteoliposomes on the addition of LolA, indicating that the C-terminal modification with biotin does not inhibit the release reaction. LolA did not induce the release of SCLP(DQ) that had not been treated with EDC-biotin. On the other hand, upon treatment with EDC-biotin, a significant portion of SCLP(DQ) was released on the addition of LolA, indicating that the carboxylic acid of Asp at position 2 was cross-linked with biotin, and therefore the negative charge required for the Lol avoidance function was lost. Cys at Position 2 of Lipoproteins Anchored to Membranes Is Inaccessible from the Solvent—The accessibility of Cys at position 2, 3, or 4 of lipoproteins was examined in proteoliposomes. Six Pal derivatives possessing Cys (Table I) were modified with maleimide biotin in the presence of a detergent, sucrose monocaprate, and therefore detected with avidin-HRP (Fig. 5). When modification with this membrane-impermeable maleimide biotin was examined after reconstitution into proteoliposomes, Pal derivatives having Cys at position 2 were not modified, whereas those having Cys at position 3 or 4 were modified. An Asp residue introduced to position 2 or 3 or both did not affect the accessibility of Cys. These results suggest that when lipoproteins are anchored to membranes, Cys at position 2 is not exposed to the solvent. Phosphatidylethanolamine Is Required for the Lol Avoidance Function of Asp at Position 2—The results presented above suggested that the residue at position 2 of lipoproteins was present in a lipid environment. Considering the importance of the negative charge of Asp, it seemed to be possible that amine-specific modification of PE affects the Lol avoidance function of Asp at position 2. To address this issue, E. coli phospholipids containing PE, phosphatidylglycerol, and CL as the major phospholipid were treated with amine-specific reagent SNA. Thin layer chromatography revealed that PE was specifically modified, i.e. the amount of PE decreased with the concomitant appearance of a new spot (data not shown). Proteoliposomes were reconstituted with SNA-treated or -untreated E. coli phospholipids. The LolA- and LolCDE-dependent release of Pal(wt) was not affected by the SNA treatment (Fig. 6A). Pal(2D) was not released from proteoliposomes reconstituted from SNA-untreated phospholipids as observed before. On the other hand, Pal(2D) was released from proteoliposomes in LolA- and LolCDE-dependent manners when SNA-treated phospholipids were used. To further examine the requirement of PE for the Lol avoidance mechanism, proteoliposomes were reconstituted with CL alone (Fig. 6B). Pal(2D) was released from CL-proteoliposomes as efficiently as Pal(wt) was. This release was completely inhibited by orthovanadate, an inhibitor of LolCDE (7Yakushi T. Masuda K. Narita S. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 212-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the Lol avoidance signal functioned in proteoliposomes reconstituted with PC alone. Taken together, these results indicate that the positive charge of phospholipids is important for the Lol avoidance function of Asp at position 2. The N-terminal second residue of lipoproteins has been thought to play a crucial role in the determination of membrane specificity (4Yamaguchi K. Fujio Y. Inouye M. Cell. 1988; 53: 423-432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 5Terada M. Kuroda T. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47690-47694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 26Seydel A. Gounon P. Pugsley A.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 810-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). However, SH-specific introduction of nonprotein molecules to the second residue did not inhibit the release of outer membrane-specific lipoproteins. These results strongly indicate that LolCDE releases outer membrane-specific lipoproteins without recognizing the second residue. It was recently found that an apolipoprotein lacking the N-terminal acyl chain was not recognized by LolCDE (15Fukuda A. Matsuyama S. Hara T. Nakayama J. Nagasawa H. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43512-43518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Therefore, LolCDE seems to only recognize the N-terminal Cys possessing three acyl chains, the sole common structure of lipoproteins. What happens if lipoproteins have Asp at position 2? It seems plausible that Asp at position 2 in combination with certain residues at position 3 makes the N-terminal structure of lipoproteins distinctive, thereby preventing the recognition of the lipid-modified Cys by LolCDE. Neither iodoacetate-modified Cys nor Glu (5Terada M. Kuroda T. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47690-47694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) at position 2 functioned as the Lol avoidance signal, whereas oxidation of Cys at position 2 to cysteic acid resulted in generation of the Lol avoidance signal. Conversely, modification of the carboxylic acid of Asp at position 2 abolished its Lol avoidance function. These results, taken together, indicate that the Lol avoidance signal should have a negative charge that is within a certain distance from Cα of the second residue (Fig. 7), which is not accessible from the solvent. Amine-specific modification of PE and substitution of PE with CL abolished the Lol avoidance function of Asp at position 2. In contrast, the Lol avoidance signal functioned in proteoliposomes reconstituted with PC. These results, taken together, strongly suggest that the electrostatic and steric complementarity between Asp at position 2 and phospholipids having a positive charge is responsible for the Lol avoidance mechanism. It seems less likely that a positive charge of phospholipids is required for the proper functioning of LolCDE, although this cannot be completely excluded at present. When Glu, Asp, Gln, or Asn is at position 3, Asp at position 2 becomes a very strong Lol avoidance signal (5Terada M. Kuroda T. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47690-47694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In contrast, His, Lys, Val, Ile, Ala, Cys, or Thr at position 3 significantly decreases the Lol avoidance function of Asp at position 2. Other residues also affect the potency of the Lol avoidance signal. Residues that strengthen the Lol avoidance function of Asp are acidic ones or their amide forms that do not undergo ionic interaction with Asp at position 2. It therefore seems likely that the third residue should not disturb the steric and electrostatic complementarity between Asp at position 2 and PE for the Lol avoidance mechanism. Interaction between Asp at position 2 and PE is likely to be strengthened by hydrogen bonds formed between Cys at position 1 and the PE molecule interacting with Asp at position 2 (Fig. 8). On the other hand, when Glu possessing a longer side chain is at position 2, the PE molecules involved in the electrostatic interaction with Glu and the hydrogen bond formation with Cys at position 1 would be different; therefore the Glu-PE interaction is not strengthened. The third residues that strengthen the Lol avoidance signal are also expected to form a salt bridge or hydrogen bond with the PE molecule interacting with Asp at position 2. Based on these considerations, we speculate that the Lol avoidance signal causes the formation of a tight lipoprotein-PE complex (Fig. 8). This complex has five acyl chains and cannot be accommodated in LolCDE. The release incompetence of the Pal(2C) dimer and apolipoprotein seems to indicate that the number of acyl chains is critical for the recognition by LolCDE. The LolC(A40P)DE complex is likely to be able to accommodate such a lipoprotein-PE complex, thereby causing the release of lipoproteins having the Lol avoidance signal. Arg at position 3 strengthened the Lol avoidance function of Asp at position 2, whereas Lys at position 3 did not (5Terada M. Kuroda T. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47690-47694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Perturbation of the electrostatic Asp-PE interaction by the positive charge at position 3 seems to be dependent on the side chain structure of the third residue. Seydel et al. (26Seydel A. Gounon P. Pugsley A.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 810-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) reported that not only Asp but also residues such as Phe, Pro, and Trp at position 2 followed by Asn at position 3 cause the inner membrane retention of lipoproteins, although E. coli native lipoproteins do not have Phe, Pro, and Trp at position 2. We have reported that when the residue at position 3 is Ser, these residues at position 2 do not cause the inner membrane retention of lipoproteins (5Terada M. Kuroda T. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47690-47694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). It seems likely that the mechanism of inner membrane retention caused by these hydrophobic residues at position 2 is different from the mechanism by which native lipoproteins remain in the inner membrane. It should also be noted that Asp at position 2 may not always be the Lol avoidance signal in other bacteria, although all Lol proteins are conserved in various Gram-negative bacteria (7Yakushi T. Masuda K. Narita S. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 212-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). For example, MexA in Pseudomonas species is an inner membrane lipoprotein possessing Gly and Lys at positions 2 and 3, respectively. In this particular case, the ionic interaction between PE and the second residue is not applicable to the Lol avoidance mechanism. Because membrane localization and sorting signals have been biochemically determined for only a few lipoprotein in other bacteria, it remains to be determined how widely the Lol avoidance mechanism shown here is applicable to the inner membrane-specific lipoproteins in bacteria. However, the Lol avoidance mechanism is likely to be required for the localization of PulA of Klebsiella oxitoca on the outer surface of the outer membrane. Pugsley and collaborators (2Pugsley A.P. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 50-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) examined the membrane localization of PulA in E. coli with or without a subset of pul genes comprising the Type II secretion pathway. Wild-type PulA having Asp at position 2 was localized on the outer surface of the outer membrane when expressed with the Type II secretion pathway. In contrast, PulA was exclusively localized on the periplasmic surface of the inner membrane in the absence of the Type II pathway, indicating that Asp at position 2 functions as the Lol avoidance signal in the absence of the Type II pathway. Substitution of Asp with another residue resulted in the localization of PulA on both the periplasmic surface and the outer surface of the outer membrane when the Type II secretion pathway was present. However, this PulA derivative was exclusively localized on the periplasmic surface of the outer membrane in the absence of the Type II secretion pathway. These observations and our findings, taken together, indicate that PulA expressed in E. coli and, presumably, K. oxitoca should have a Lol avoidance signal to be efficiently translocated to the outer surface of the outer membrane through the Type II pathway, otherwise the Lol system causes the localization of PulA to the periplasmic surface of the outer membrane. The structural characteristics critical for the Lol avoidance function were revealed in this study. Because the structure of LolCDE also affects the Lol avoidance function (16Narita S. Kanamaru K. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 167-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), it is of great interest to identify the localized structure of LolCDE that determines the Lol avoidance.

Using a Cre-loxP approach to overcome early embryonic lethality, we have studied functions of TGF-β/Smad4 signals in the central nervous system (CNS). No obvious deficits were detected in mice carrying the targeted disruption of Smad4 in the CNS. The overall morphology of the hippocampus appeared normal. There was no change in the proliferation of neuronal precursor cells, nor in several forms of synaptic plasticity. In contrast, deletion of Smad4 resulted in a marked decrease in the number of cerebellar Purkinje cells and parvalbumin-positive interneurons. Accompanied by the abnormality in the cerebellum, mutant mice also exhibited significantly increased vertical activity. Thus, our study reveals an unexpected role for Smad4 in cerebellar development and in the control of motor function.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3971) Google Scholar). The TGF-β subfamily has 3 members: TGF-β1, β2, β3. In the brain, TGF-β1 is expressed mainly in the meninges (2Unsicker K. Strelau J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6972-6975Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 3Bottner M. Krieglstein K. Unsicker K. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 2227-2240Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). During early development, TGF-β2 and β3 are widely expressed in the CNS (4Flanders K.C. Ludecke G. Engels S. Cissel D.S. Roberts A.B. Kondaiah P. Lafyatis R. Sporn M.B. Unsicker K. Development. 1991; 113: 183-191PubMed Google Scholar). However, their expression is generally not associated with areas enriched with dividing progenitor cells, suggesting that TGF-βs are not involved in controlling mitosis in the CNS (except in cerebellar granule neurons of external granular layer) (3Bottner M. Krieglstein K. Unsicker K. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 2227-2240Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). In the adult brain, TGF-β2 immunoreactivities are found in astrocytes as well as in large neurons such as pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus, cortex, spinal motor neurons, and cerebellar Purkinje neurons (5Unsicker K. Flanders K.C. Cissel D.S. Lafyatis R. Sporn M.B. Neuroscience. 1991; 44: 613-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). TGF-β3 is widely distributed throughout the postnatal brains although at very low levels (2Unsicker K. Strelau J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6972-6975Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 3Bottner M. Krieglstein K. Unsicker K. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 2227-2240Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). In the cerebellum, TGF-β2 is the predominant isoform produced by Purkinje cells and by both proliferating and postmitotic granule cells (6Constam D.B. Schmid P. Aguzzi A. Schachner M. Fontana A. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1994; 6: 766-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). TGF-β2 regulates the proliferation of cultured cerebellar neurons (6Constam D.B. Schmid P. Aguzzi A. Schachner M. Fontana A. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1994; 6: 766-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 7Kane C.J. Brown G.J. Phelan K.D. Dev. Brain Res. 1996; 96: 46-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). TGF-β2 has also been shown to promote neurite growth and prevent neuronal death induced by ischemia or neurotoxic agents in cultured hippocampal neurons (8Zhu Y. Yang G.Y. Ahlemeyer B. Pang L.

The bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) belong to the second and the largest subfamily that contains many members. BMPs and their receptors are expressed in brain (14Ebendal T. Bengtsson H. Soderstrom S. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 51: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Treatment of neural plate explants with BMPs induces the expression of cerebellar granule cell markers, and BMP-treated neural cells form mature granule cells after transplantation into the postnatal cerebellum (15Alder J. Lee K.J. Jessell T.M. Hatten M.E. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 535-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). BMP-7 enhances dendritic growth in cultured hippocampal neurons (16Withers G.S. Higgins D. Charette M. Banker G. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 106-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The third subfamily, the activins, is mostly involved in neural induction at the early stage of development (17Weinstein D.C. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), but has been shown to support the survival of hippocampal neurons in culture (18Iwahori Y. Saito H. Torii K. Nishiyama N. Brain Res. 1997; 760: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Despite extensive studies using cultured cells, the functional role of TGF-βs in vivo has not been well established. One of the major difficulties is that mice lacking TGF-βs die early in development (19Weinstein M. Yang X. Deng C. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2000; 11: 49-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 20Dunker N. Krieglstein K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6982-6988Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). All TGF-β signal via the same heteromeric, serine-therine kinase receptor complex containing type I (Tβ RI) and type II (Tβ RII) receptors (1Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3971) Google Scholar). Ligand binding induces association of Tβ RI and Tβ RII, leading to unidirectional phosphorylation and activation of Tβ RI by Tβ RII. The signal transduction mechanisms of TGF-βs require Smad proteins, which constitute a family of 8 members (21Massague J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar, 22Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Science. 2002; 296: 1646-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar). Smads are divided into three major classes. The first class is called receptor-regulated, or R-Smads, which includes Smads 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8. These Smads are directly phosphorylated by Tβ RI, and can be further divided into two categories: Smad2 and Smad3 respond to TGF-β and activins (23Nakao A. Afrakhte M. Moren A. Nakayama T.

Massague J. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 186-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). The third class is called Co-Smad, and contains only one member, Smad4, also known as DPC4. Smad4 forms various heterodimers with the R-Smads, which in turn are translocated to the nucleus to induce or repress the expression of TGF-β target genes. Smad4/DPC4 is therefore the central mediator of the signal transduction of all TGF-βs (28Kretzschmar M. Liu F. Hata A. Doody J. Massague J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 984-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar, 29Lagna G. Hata A. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massague J. Nature. 1996; 383: 832-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). Mutant mice carrying a targeted disruption of Smad4 died at embryonic day 7, indicating an indispensable role of Smad4 signals in early stages of embryonic development (36Sirard C. de la Pompa J.L. Elia A. Itie A. Mirtsos C. Cheung A. Hahn S. Wakeham A. Schwartz L. Kern S.E. Rossant J. Mak T.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 107-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 37Yang X. Li C. Xu X. Deng C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3667-3672Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). However, a role of Smad4 in postnatal development and adult remains illusive due to the early lethality associated with the Smad4 deficiency. Very little is known about the expression and distribution of Smad proteins in the brain. Even less is known about the role of Smads in the development and function of the brain. A recent study showed that in cerebellar cultures, BMP4 application elicits nuclear translocation of Smad1 and promotes the differentiation of both neurons and astrocytes, and these effects were attenuated by treatment of the cultures with antisense oligonucleotides to Smad1 or Smad4 (38Angley C. Kumar M. Dinsio K.J. Hall A.K. Siegel R.E. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 260-268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, majority of the studies on functions of TGF-βs in the nervous system have been done using culture models (2Unsicker K. Strelau J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6972-6975Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 3Bottner M. Krieglstein K. Unsicker K. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 2227-2240Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The goal of the present study is to investigate the role of TGF-βs/Smads in the development and/or function of the CNS in vivo. Since Smad4 is the Co-Smad essential for all TGF-βs/Smads signaling, we chose to examine the functional consequences of the inhibition of Smad4 in the brain. To overcome embryonic lethality of the Smad4 knockout, we used the Cre-loxP approach to specifically disrupt Smad4 in the brain. Surprisingly, we found that mice with deletion of Smad4 in the brain were relatively normal. Detailed analyses revealed a significant decrease in the number of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum, and abnormal function in vertical locomotive activity. In contrast, the loss of Smad4 does not interfere with hippocampal development and functions despite of its high expression in this region. These results indicate a critical role of Smad4 in cerebellum development and motor control. Mouse Strains, Genotyping --Mice with two loxP-flanked Smad4 alleles (Smad4Co) were crossed with transgenic mice in which Nestin regulatory element controls Cre recombinase expression (Nes-Cre). We found that the paternally derived Nes-Cre [Smad4Co /Co (female) X Smad4Co /+ ;Nes-Cre (male)] caused embryonic lethality of Smad4Co / Co; Nes-Cre offspring. To generate adult mice lacking Smad4 in the CNS, Smad4Co /+ ;Nes-Cre or Smad4Co /Co;Nes-Cre females were used to cross with Smad4Co /Co males. In these crosses, the Smad4Co /Co;Nes-Cre offspring survived to adulthood at a rate closed to predicted. To examine the spatial distribution of Cre-mediated recombination, we crossed female Nes-Cre transgenic mice with male Rosa-26 reporter line that express β-galactosidase upon cre-mediated removal of a stop codon (39Soriano P. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 70-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (4143) Google Scholar). Mice carrying a Smad4 conditional allele were genotyped by PCR with the following primers: Smad4-9: 5′-GGG CAG CGT AGC ATA TAA GA-3′, Smad4-10: 5′-GAC CCA AAC GTC ACC TTC AC-3′. For genotyping Nestin-Cre transgene, we used the following primers: CreF: 5′-TGG GCG GCA TGG TGC AAG TT-3′, CreR: 5′-CCG TGCTAA CCA GCG TTT TC-3′. All animal procedures were conducted in complete compliance with National Institutes of Health Guidelines. Southern, Northern, and Western Blots—Southern: Genomic DNAs from hippocampus or cerebellum were digested by EcoRV, and hybridized with 32P-labeled probe indicated in Fig. 2A. Northern: RNAs were isolated from adult brains using RNA STAT-60 according to manufacturer's instruction (Tel-Test, Inc.). About 30 μg of total RNA from each sample was separated on an agarose gel and transferred to a Gene-Screen filter. The probe, a 5′-end cDNA fragment (800 bp), was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by nick translation to a specific activity of around 109 cpm/μg. The filters were hybridized with the probe at high stringency (65 °C), washed at 54 °C in 0.1× SSC, and exposed to Kodak XAR-5 films, which were scanned. The intensities of the bands were quantified using NIH Image software. Signals from mutant mice were calculated as the percentage of the average signals in the wild type mice in the same blot. Western: Proteins from homogenized cerebellar tissues were separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose filter. Parvalbumin was detected by a mouse monoclonal antibody against parvalbumin (Sigma, 1:1000), followed by a peroxidase-labeled sheep anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences; 1:5000), using a standard ECL procedure. X-Gal Histochemistry, Histology, and Immunohistochemistry—For X-gal staining, animals were anesthetized and transcardially perfused with 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 5 ml of 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS, and then. In all cases, animals were anesthetized and transcardially perfused with 10∼20 ml of PBS, 40 ml of 2∼4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, and then 5∼20 ml of PBS. For X-gal staining, the brains were processed through a series of sucrose-PBS solutions (15∼30%), sectioned into 10-20-μm thick (coronal or sagittal) sections on a vibratome. The sections were mounted on gelatin-coated slides, air dried, and fixed again in 2% paraformaldehyde, 0.125% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 3 min. The sections were rinsed in PBS containing 2 mm MgCl2, 0.01% sodium deoxycholate, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, and incubated in X-gal-staining buffer (containing 1 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-d-galactopyranoside) at room temperature overnight. For hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of hippocampus and cerebellum, the brains were postfixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 6-16 h and embedded in paraffin. Thin sections (10-20 μm) were cut and processed according to standard protocol. For immunocytochemistry, the brains were postfixed overnight then were cryoprotected in 30% sucrose, and sectioned at 40 μm in a cryostat. The following primary antibodies were used: monoclonal antibodies against parvalbumin D-28k (Sigma, 1:1000) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP, DAKO). Positive cells were detected by the Zymed Laboratories Inc. HistoMouse-SP kit (Zymed Laboratories Inc., or by FITC-conjugated secondary antibody. To measure apoptotic cells on tissue sections, we used a terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay detection system from Intergen according to the manufacturer's directions. BrdU Labeling—Mice received an intraperitoneal injection of BrdU (Sigma, 300 mg/kg body weight) and were killed 3 h later by transcardial perfusion of 4% paraformaldehyde. Frozen sections (40 μm) were cut and processed for BrdU immunohistochemistry with diaminobenzidine (DAB) following the ZYMED BrdU staining protocol (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). In brief, endogenous peroxidases were inactivated in methanol/H2O2 (196 ml/4 ml) for 20 min at room temperature. Sections were treated with trypsin for 25 min and denatured by HCl (4 n) for 30 min then incubated in blocking solution for 20 min at room temperature. After incubating overnight at 4 °C with biotinylated monoclonal mouse anti-BrdU, the slices were incubated with streptavidin-peroxidase for 10 min and DAB mixture for 10 min. All slices were counterstained with Hematoxylin. The slides were dehydrated in a graded series of alcohol, cleared with xylene and cover-slipped under Histomount. Cell Counting—Cells were counted in a one-in-six series of sections (40 μm per section, 240 μm apart) from Smad4Co / CoNes-Cre and Smad4Co /Co mice by the optical fractionator method (40West M.J. Slomianka L. Gundersen H.J. Anat. Rec. 1991; 231: 482-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (2607) Google Scholar). The stereology setup consists an Olympus IX70 microscope fitted with a Ludl AMG 5000 XYZ motorized stage (Ludl Electronic Products Ltd) and a Micro-Max 1300 cooled CCD camera (Roper Scientific, Inc.). Images were acquired by IPLab software (Scannalytics). Positive cells (BrdU or parvalbumin labeled) were counted under an oil immersion objective (60×, numerical aperture = 1.25) by a Gundersen's unbiased counting frame (41Gundersen H.J. J. Microscopy. 1977; 111: 219-223Crossref Scopus (1177) Google Scholar) within the optical dissector height, which was set at the middle 2/3 of total tissue thickness for each section. The sampling was performed according to unbiased stereological principles (42Gundersen H.J. Jensen E.B. J. Microsc. 1987; 147: 229-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (3063) Google Scholar). The total positive cell number (N) was estimated as in Equation 1, N=sumQ-×1/tsf×1/asf×1/ssf(Eq. 1) where sum Q - is the total number of cells actually counted in the disectors; tsf is the thickness sampling fraction; asf is area sampling fraction; and ssf is the section sampling fraction. Slice Preparation and Electrophysiology—Transverse hippocampal slices (400 μm) were prepared from control and mutant mice (4-5-week-old). The slices were maintained in an interface chamber for both recovery (2 h) and recording, and exposed to an artificial atmosphere of 95% O2, 5%CO2 (43Pozzo-Miller L. Gottschalk W.A. Zhang L. McDermott K. Du J. Gopalakrishnan R. Oho C. Shen Z. Lu B. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4972-4983Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The slices were perfused in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF, 34 °C) containing (in mm): NaCl 124, KCl 3.0, CaCl2 2.5, MgCl2 1.5, NaHCO3 26, KH2PO4 1.25, glucose 10, ascorbic acid 2, pH 7.4, at a rate of 15 ml/h. Field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) were evoked in molecular layer by stimulating medial or lateral perforant pathways (MPP, LPP, respectively) in dentate gyrus with Teflon-insulated monopolar stainless steel electrodes and recorded with ACSF-filled glass pipettes (<5 MΩ) using an Axoclamp-2B amplifier (Axon Instruments). Test stimuli consisted of monophasic 200 μsec pulses of constant current delivered by stimulus isolation units. Basal synaptic transmission was monitored at every 30 s with a stimulus intensity that produced a quarter-maximal response. EPSPs were digitized (10 kHz), filtered at 3 kHz using acquisition system pClamp6, stored on magnetic media and analyzed off-line using Clampfit 8.0 (Axon Instruments) and Microsoft Excel visual basic programming (Microsoft Corp.). Tetanic stimulation (100 Hz, 500 ms duration, repeated every 30 s for 4 times) at a stimulus intensity that elicited the maximal EPSP was used to induce LTP. The positions of the stimulating and recording electrodes were adjusted to obtain selective stimulation of MPP or LPP, based on the following two criteria (44Dahl D. Sarvey J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4776-4780Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). First, the polarity of EPSPs reverses across the outer and middle third of the molecular cell layer by stimulation of the LPP or MPP, reflecting an inward current sink or an outward current source. The sharp polarity reverse indicates that a fine local stimulation of LPP or MPP fibers. Second, the LPP-dentate synapses exhibit paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) of the EPSP whereas the MPP-dentate synapses exhibit paired pulse depression (PPD) at certain intervals (45Colino A. Malenka R.C. J. Neurophysiol. 1993; 69: 1150-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). For response to high frequency stimulation (HFS), changes in EPSPs over time were obtained by normalizing successive EPSP slopes to the first EPSP slope in the train. EPSP slopes were plotted against the number of the stimulus in each HFS. Behavioral Tests—(1) Open-field activity. Animals were individually placed in a Digiscan open-field box (RXYZCM, AccuScan Instruments, Inc.) equipped with two rows of infrared beams that automatically detect and quantify their activities. The horizontal (locomotor activity) and vertical (rearing) activities were measured by the number of times an animal broke the first (lower) and the second (upper) row infrared beams, respectively (2). Balance bar task. Mice were held upside-down by their tails and then placed against a wooden rod allowing mice to grasp the rod only with their hind limbs. The tails were then released and the time it took the mice to pull themselves into a balanced position upon the rod was recorded (3). Rotarod test. Mice were placed on a rotating drum and the time they were able to maintain their balance on the rod was measured at low (3 rpm) and high (23 rpm) speeds. The latency and rotation speed at which the animal falls off were recorded. Cre-mediated Inactivation of Smad4 in Adult Central Nervous System—To specifically inactivate Smad4 in the CNS, we crossed mice carrying a Smad4 conditional allele (Smad4Co) (46Yang X. Li C. Herrera P.L. Deng C.X. Genesis. 2002; 32: 80-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) with mice carrying a Nes-Cre transgene (47Trumpp A. Depew M.J. Rubenstein J.L. Bishop J.M. Martin G.R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3136-3148Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). The Nes-Cre mice have been used in a number of previous studies, all of which used male Nes-Cre mice to cross with female mice carrying conditional alleles. Several groups (48Bates B. Rios M. Trumpp A. Chen C. Fan G. Bishop J.M. Jaenisch R. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 115-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 49Crone S.A. Negro A. Trumpp A. Giovannini M. Lee K.F.

Science. 2001; 294: 2186-2189Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar) reported high efficiency (70-100%) of Cre-mediated deletion in CNS during late embryonic stages. In our initial crosses, we found that when the Nes-Cre was from male [Smad4Co /Co (female) X Smad4Co /+ ;Nes-Cre (male)], the Smad4Co / Co;Nes-Cre offspring died at early post-implantation stages exhibiting defects very similar to the those of Smad4 -/- mice (37Yang X. Li C. Xu X. Deng C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3667-3672Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), Table I). These results not only confirm the importance of Smad4 in early embryos, but also suggest that paternally derived Nes-Cre is active at very early stages. In contrast, when the Nes-Cre was from female [Smad4Co /+ ;Nes-Cre (female) X Smad4Co /Co (male)], the Smad4Co / Co;Nes-Cre mice survived to adulthood. Since our goal was to study the role of Smad4 in the CNS in the adult, the latter cross was used in the remaining studies.Table IMating scheme and frequency of mutant miceMating classMating schemePredictedActualType 1aCO/CO (F) × CO/Cre (M)1/4 (25%)1.4%Type 1cCO (F) × CO/Cre (M)1/8 (12.5%)0.5%Type 2aCO/CO (M) × CO/Cre (F)1/4 (25%)17.4%Type 2bCO/CO (M) × CO/COCre (F)1/2 (50%)45.3%Type 2cCO (M) × CO/Cre (F)1/8 (12.5%)11.1% Open table in a new tab To determine whether and when the maternally derived Nes-Cre is expressed during CNS development, we crossed female Nes-Cre transgenic mice with male Rosa-26 reporter line that express β-galactosidase upon cre-mediated removal of a stop codon (39Soriano P. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 70-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (4143) Google Scholar). The Cre gene was expressed as early as E11.5 (Fig. 1A), and gradually increased during development (not shown). In 4-week-old mice, the Cre-expressing cells were found throughout the brain (Fig. 1B). Strong expression was detected in the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus and CA1-CA3 regions of the hippocampus (Fig. 1C), and in the Purkinje cell layer of the cerebellum (Fig. 1D). The expression of Nes-Cre in the hippocampus and cerebellum was maintained and perhaps slightly increased as animals grew older (e.g. Fig. 1E, 7-week-old hippocampus, Fig. 1F, 10-week-old cerebellum). These results suggest that the maternally derived Nes-Cre is expressed in somatic cells in the CNS, albeit slightly later in embryonic development than that derived paternally. This delayed expression of Nes-Cre may explain why the [Smad4Co /+ ;Nes-Cre (female) X Smad4Co /Co (male)] crosses were not embryonically lethal (Table I). In the mean time, we have achieved effective deletion of the Smad4 gene postnatally in the brain. Fig. 2A shows the structures of wild-type allele, conditional allele, and Nes-Cre-mediated deletion of the exon 8 of the Smad4 gene. Southern and Northern blot analyses of Smad4 were performed to determine the extent of Cre-mediated recombination. Southern blot analysis on DNA isolated from hippocampus and cerebellum indicated that the deletion of Smad4 was incomplete (Fig. 2B). Further, Northern blot revealed that the levels of Smad4 transcripts in hippocampus and cerebellum of the conditional mutants (Smad4Co / Co;Nes-Cre) were reduced by ∼80% (Fig. 2C). Since the Cre-mediated deletion of Smad4 occurred effectively in postnatal Purkinje cells in the cerebellum and granule cells in hippocampus, we focused on the analysis of the development of these areas in the Smad4Co / Co;Nes-Cre mice. Lack of Effects of Smad4-deficiency on Hippocampus Development and Function—The shape and the size of brains from Smad4Co / Co;Nes-Cre mice appeared normal (not shown). Examination of histological sections throughout the brain did not reveal any gross morphological abnormality (not shown). Since the expression of Smad4 and Nes-Cre recombinase activity was relatively high in the hippocampus, we analyzed this region in some details. The cytoarchitectural organization of the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus and pyramidal cell layer of CA1-CA3 regions in Smad4Co / Co;Nes-Cre mice was almost identical to that of control (Smad4Co /Co) mice (Fig. 3, A and B). Thus, the inactivation of Smad4 does not seem to elicit overt abnormality in hippocampal anatomy or developmen"
https://openalex.org/W2075604280,"Heat shock factor (HSF) is best characterized as the transcriptional regulator of heat shock protein genes, required by all cells to survive periods of stress. Recent evidence suggests that HSF also functions to regulate the expression of genes involved in growth and development under normal physiological conditions. In this study, we used RNA interference (RNAi) assays to investigate the role of HSF in Caenorhabditis elegans. Exposure of wild-type worms to hsf dsRNAi constructs caused a temperature-sensitive developmental arrest at the L2/L3 stage. At normal growth temperatures, hsf(RNAi) worms that developed to adults were small and scrawny, largely infertile, and showed a significant reduction in life span. These results demonstrate that HSF is required for normal postembryonic development under physiological conditions. Following heat shock, hsf(RNAi) worms were thermosensitive and displayed a significant reduction of hsp16 expression. When hsf(RNAi) was carried out in various dauer-constitutive mutant backgrounds, a dramatic reversal of dauer formation was observed, indicating that HSF is also required in the dauer pathway. In its natural habitat of the soil, where C. elegans is exposed to a constantly fluctuating environment; the ability to integrate the stress response with development may be an essential element of its ecology."
https://openalex.org/W1994979924,"Recent studies have suggested that the alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (alpha7 AChR) may play a role in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. In search for peripheral biological markers for schizophrenia we have investigated alpha7 mRNA levels in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) of schizophrenic patients and healthy controls. Peripheral blood samples were collected from medicated and non-medicated (drug naive) schizophrenic patients as well as from healthy (non-mentally ill) smokers and non-smokers. RNA was prepared from isolated lymphocytes. Polymerase chain reaction products specific for human alpha7 AChR were quantified by densitometry using Scion image-analysis (shared NIH software). We observed a significant decrease of alpha7 mRNA levels on PBLs of schizophrenic patients compared with controls. The decrease in alpha7 mRNA levels was not a result of medication management, because non-medicated schizophrenic patients displayed the same level of reduction in alpha7 mRNA as did patients receiving medication. In addition, we exclude the possibility that the observed decrease in alpha7 mRNA levels resulted from nicotine consumption in smoking, because healthy smokers exhibited the same levels of alpha7 mRNA as non-smokers. We propose that alpha7 AChR may be involved in the pathophysiology of the disease and may serve as a reliable peripheral biological marker in schizophrenia."

https://openalex.org/W2148994044,"We have cloned a Xenopus Dbf4-related factor named Drf1 and characterized this protein by using Xenopus egg extracts. Drf1 forms an active complex with the kinase Cdc7. However, most of the Cdc7 in egg extracts is not associated with Drf1, which raises the possibility that some or all of the remaining Cdc7 is bound to another Dbf4-related protein. Immunodepletion of Drf1 does not prevent DNA replication in egg extracts. Consistent with this observation, Cdc45 can still associate with chromatin in Drf1-depleted extracts, albeit at significantly reduced levels. Nonetheless, Drf1 displays highly regulated binding to replicating chromatin. Treatment of egg extracts with aphidicolin results in a substantial accumulation of Drf1 on chromatin. This accumulation is blocked by addition of caffeine and by immunodepletion of either ATR or Claspin. These observations suggest that the increased binding of Drf1 to aphidicolin-treated chromatin is an active process that is mediated by a caffeine-sensitive checkpoint pathway containing ATR and Claspin. Abrogation of this pathway also leads to a large increase in the binding of Cdc45 to chromatin. This increase is substantially reduced in the absence of Drf1, which suggests that regulation of Drf1 might be involved in the suppression of Cdc45 loading during replication arrest. We also provide evidence that elimination of this checkpoint causes resumed initiation of DNA replication in both Xenopus tissue culture cells and egg extracts. Taken together, these observations argue that Drf1 is regulated by an intra-S-phase checkpoint mechanism that down-regulates the loading of Cdc45 onto chromatin containing DNA replication blocks.

In eukaryotes, DNA replication is initiated by a multistep process. Early in the G1-phase, replication initiation factors are sequentially assembled onto replication origins to form prereplicative complexes (pre-RCs). 1The abbreviations used are: pre-RC, pre-replicative complex; XTC, Xenopus tadpole cell; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; GST, glutathione S-transferase; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; CIB, chromatin isolation buffer; HBS, HEPES-buffered saline.1The abbreviations used are: pre-RC, pre-replicative complex; XTC, Xenopus tadpole cell; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; GST, glutathione S-transferase; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; CIB, chromatin isolation buffer; HBS, HEPES-buffered saline. At the core of the pre-RC is the origin recognition complex, a six-subunit protein assembly which is required for the subsequent loading of other pre-RC components, including Cdc6/Cdc18, Cdt1, and the Mcms (1Nishitani H. Lygerou Z. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 523-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The second phase of the initiation process involves the transition of the pre-RC to a pre-initiation complex (2Zou L. Stillman B. Science. 1998; 280: 593-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). A key determinant for this step is the loading of Cdc45 onto pre-RCs (3Zou L. Stillman B. Mol. Cell.

It has been proposed that the S-phase cyclin-dependent kinases act as global activators of S-phase onset, whereas Dbf4-Cdc7 functions at the level of the individual origins and is therefore required throughout S-phase (11Bousset K. Diffley J.F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 480-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 12Donaldson A.D. Fangman W.L. Brewer B.J.

In yeast, the Cdc7 subunit is present at constant levels throughout the cell cycle, whereas the Dbf4 subunit accumulates only during the G1/S-phase and is then degraded by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis (13Pasero P.

Chem. 2000; 275: 18011-18021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).

A. 2001; 98: 54-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In S-phase cells, the presence of stalled replication forks or damaged DNA invokes a checkpoint response that delays entry into mitosis until the defect has been repaired (23Zhou B.B. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (2633) Google Scholar, 24O'Connell M.J. Walworth N.C. Carr A.M.

Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). These regulatory mechanisms are known as S-M checkpoints. The signal transduction cascades that underlie S-M checkpoints have been well characterized in yeast model systems. A defect is recognized by various sensor proteins, which elicit activation of the effector kinases Chk1 or Cds1 (Rad53 in budding yeast), depending on the nature of the checkpoint-inducing DNA signal. These kinases then phosphorylate key targets within the cell cycle machinery to delay mitosis (24O'Connell M.J. Walworth N.C. Carr A.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 296-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). In vertebrates, homologues of the Rad3 protein include ATR and ATM, both members of the family of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-like kinases (26Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2177-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1664) Google Scholar). Evidence suggests that ATR is involved in the detection of replication blocks, whereas ATM is activated in response to DNA damage, leading to activation of Chk1 and Chk2, respectively (27Guo Z.

Another protein that has been implicated in the signaling in response to replication blocks is Claspin, which was discovered in Xenopus as a Chk1-binding protein that is essential for activation of Chk1 following induction of the replication checkpoint (33Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 839-849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Recent studies in vertebrate systems have also identified a checkpoint pathway that prevents the onset of DNA replication in the presence of damaged DNA. In Xenopus, one of the targets of this checkpoint pathway is the Cdc45 protein. Reconstitution of the DNA damage checkpoint in a Xenopus cell-free system identified a pathway that activates ATM in response to DNA containing double-strand breaks (7Costanzo V. Robertson K. Ying C.Y. Kim E. Avvedimento E. Gottesman M. Grieco D. Gautier J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 649-659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). ATM, in turn, down-regulates cyclin E-Cdk2 activity, thus preventing the loading of Cdc45 onto chromatin and inhibiting DNA replication. Similarly, Cdc45 is a target of a checkpoint induced by treatment with etoposide, a topoisomerase II inhibitor (34Costanzo V. Shechter D. Lupardus P.J. Cimprich K.A. Gottesman M. Gautier J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 203-213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Activation of this checkpoint, which is mediated by ATR, leads to the down-regulation of Cdc7-associated kinase activity and inhibition of the binding of Cdc45 to chromatin. In yeast, similar pathways are involved in signaling a third checkpoint, the intra-S-phase checkpoint. This checkpoint inhibits the firing of late replication origins in the presence of stalled replication forks or DNA damage that occurs during S-phase. In budding yeast, both subunits of the Dbf4-Cdc7 kinase undergo Rad53-dependent phosphorylation in response to treatment with hydroxyurea. This phosphorylation releases Dbf4-Cdc7 from chromatin, inhibits its kinase activity, and thereby prevents the loading of Cdc45 (4Aparicio O.M. Stout A.M. Bell S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In mammalian cells, a recent study showed that mice lacking Cdc7 are embryonic lethal, demonstrating that this kinase is essential for embryonic development (36Kim J.M. Nakao K. Nakamura K. Saito I. Katsuki M. Arai K. Masai H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2168-2179Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Furthermore, when Cdc7 was conditionally removed from an embryonic stem cell line, cells arrested within S-phase with partially replicated DNA. These results support a critical role for the Dbf4-Cdc7 kinase in ensuring the integrity of the DNA throughout the process of replication. In this study we have cloned a Xenopus member of the Dbf4 family, which we have named Xenopus Dbf4-related factor 1 (Drf1). The Drf1 protein is not essential for DNA replication or the recruitment of Cdc45 to chromatin during normal S-phase. However, Drf1 displays highly regulated binding to replicating chromatin. Unlike the scenario in yeast and the etoposide-induced pathway in Xenopus, we have observed that, following replication fork arrest, Drf1 and Cdc7 accumulate on chromatin. This binding is dependent upon ATR and Claspin, and is abrogated by treatment with caffeine. The loss of Drf1 from chromatin in the presence of caffeine correlates with an increase in Cdc45 loading, which is also observed in aphidicolin-treated extracts lacking ATR or Claspin. Caffeine is also capable of overriding an intra-S checkpoint that prevents further initiation events in the presence of aphidicolin, both in XTC cells and in egg extracts. We have established a biochemical assay for this checkpoint by using alkaline agarose gels and have observed a significant increase in the synthesis of small DNA fragments when extracts are treated with aphidicolin and caffeine. We hypothesize that activation of ATR by stalled replication forks leads to the accumulation of Drf1 on chromatin in a checkpoint-dependent manner. This checkpoint-dependent association of Drf1 with chromatin may play a role in preventing the binding of Cdc45 to chromatin during a replication arrest. Cloning of a Xenopus Drf1 Homologue—The following oligonucleotides were designed corresponding to sequences in a Xenopus expressed sequence tag (accession no. BG408573) from the EMBL sequence library: sense, 5′-gcagcaggacgatgaacccccattggcc-3′; antisense, 5′-ccttccgttccgcagcctggatttgggac-3′. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using a Xenopus cDNA library generated with the Marathon RACE kit (Clontech) served as the template. The 270-bp PCR product was subsequently biotinylated and used as a probe to screen a Xenopus oocyte cDNA library in the pAX-NMT vector (37Mueller P.R. Coleman T.R. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 119-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) using the ClonCapture cDNA selection kit (Clontech). The same PCR fragment was radiolabeled and used to isolate the full-length cDNA from the pool of clones enriched for Drf1. Positive clones were verified by PCR, and sequencing of both strands was performed with an ABI model 373 automated sequencer. The GenBank™ accession no. for Drf1 is AY328889. Antibodies—Xenopus Cdc7 was amplified by PCR with the following oligonucleotides: 5′-gggaattccatatgagttcgggcgataattcagg-3′ and 5′-actggggaattcctaccgcatgtttttaaacagagc-3′ (38Roberts B.T. Ying C.Y. Gautier J. Maller J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2800-2804Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The RACE Xenopus cDNA library described above served as the template. The full-length Cdc7 coding sequence was cloned into the NdeI and EcoRI sites of the pET3-His6X vector, and the resulting plasmid was transformed into Codon Plus Escherichia coli cells for expression and purification as described (38Roberts B.T. Ying C.Y. Gautier J. Maller J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2800-2804Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Antibodies were affinity-purified using standard methods with the antigen described above conjugated to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences). Antibodies were raised against an N-terminal fragment of Drf1. The fragment was amplified by PCR using the following oligonucleotides: sense, 5′-gggaattccatatgcagcaggacgatgaacc-3′; antisense, 5′-gccaggtgaattcctatgtggggctcac-3′. The 1270-bp fragment was cloned into the NdeI and EcoRI sites of the pET3-His6X vector and expressed in Codon Plus cells. The fusion protein was purified from inclusion bodies as described above for Cdc7. Antibodies were affinity-purified as described above. Affinity-purified antibodies against Xenopus Claspin, Chk1, and ATR, and antisera against Orc2 were described previously (33Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol.

Monoclonal antibodies against human Mcm2 were obtained commercially (BM28, BD Biosciences). Antibodies recognizing Xenopus Mcm4 were kindly provided by J. Blow. Control rabbit IgG was obtained from Zymed Laboratories Inc.. Xenopus GST-Mcm2 was cloned into pGEX4T2 vector (Amersham Biosciences), expressed in Codon Plus cells, and purified with GST-agarose. Recombinant geminin was purified as described (33Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 839-849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 39Lee J. Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G.

Nature. 1996; 379: 357-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Egg Extracts—Xenopus egg extracts were prepared as described (41Murray A.W. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 36: 581-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). Egg extracts arrested in interphase because of the presence of unreplicated DNA routinely contained 3000 demembranated Xenopus sperm nuclei/μl of extract and 100 μg/ml aphidicolin. Caffeine was added to a final concentration of 5 mm from a 100 mm solution freshly dissolved in 10 mm Pipes-KOH (pH 7.5). Immunodepletion—Immunodepletions of Chk1 and Claspin from egg extracts were carried out with Affiprep-protein A beads (Bio-Rad) as described previously (33Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 839-849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). For immunodepletion of Cdc7 and Drf1, 100 μl of serum coupled to Affiprep-protein A beads was used per 100 μl of CSF-arrested extract, during two rounds of depletion. Pre-immune serum served as a control. For immunodepletion of ATR, 25 μg of antibody coated on protein A-magnetic beads (Dynal) was incubated with extracts on ice for 1 h. The beads were removed with a magnet, and the procedure was repeated. Chromatin Isolation—Egg extracts (100 μl) containing 3000 sperm nuclei/μl were overlaid on a 1-ml sucrose cushion containing chromatin isolation buffer (CIB; 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.6), 1 m sucrose, 80 mm KCl, 25 mm potassium gluconate, and 10 mm magnesium gluconate), and centrifuged at 6100 × g for 5 min. The pellets were washed twice with CIB + 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and centrifuged as above. The chromatin pellets were boiled in 2× SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. To elute chromatin-associated proteins, chromatin pellets were prepared from 400 μl of extract by overlaying 200 μl on a 1-ml sucrose cushion in duplicate. Samples were centrifuged at 6100 × g for 5 min. Chromatin pellets were washed twice with CIB and then once with CIB + 0.5% Nonidet P-40. The supernatants were removed, and the chromatin pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of 1 m NaCl, 10 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.6). Samples were incubated on ice for 10 min and then centrifuged at 11,700 × g for 5 min. The supernatant contained the proteins eluted from chromatin. Replication Assays—To monitor DNA replication, egg extracts were incubated with sperm nuclei (1000–3000 sperm nuclei/μl), 0.4 mm CaCl2, 100 μg/ml cycloheximide, and 1 μl of [α-32P]dATP for 90 min at room temperature. The reaction was terminated upon addition of an equal volume of 2× replication stop buffer (80 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 8 mm EDTA, 0.13% phosphoric acid, 10% Ficoll, 5% SDS, and 0.2% bromphenol blue), and 1 mg/ml proteinase K, followed by incubation at 55 °C for 1 h. Samples were run on 1% agarose gels, dried, and detected by a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitations and Kinase Assays—For immunoprecipitation of Drf1 and Cdc7 from egg extracts, 100 μl of extract was diluted 3-fold with 10 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm EGTA, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and centrifuged at 11,700 × g for 10 min to pellet nuclei. Supernatants were removed and incubated with 5 μg of affinity-purified antibody bound to Affiprep-protein A beads for 1 h at 4 °C with rotation. The beads were washed three times with buffer X (10 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.6), 80 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm EGTA, 20 mm β-glycerolphosphate, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40), then once with HBS (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.6)). For immunoprecipitation of proteins eluted from chromatin, the supernatant was removed and diluted 8-fold with 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.6) and incubated with 5 μg of antibody bound to Affiprep-protein A beads for 1 h at 4 °C with rotation. The beads were washed three times with buffer X, and then once with HBS. For in vitro kinase assays, the beads were resuspended in HBS. One half was boiled in 2× SDS sample buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted for Drf1 and Cdc7. The other half was incubated with kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 μm ATP) containing [γ-32P]ATP and 1 μg of GST-Mcm2. Samples were incubated at room temperature for 15 min with rotation, then boiled in 2× SDS sample buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and detected by a PhosphorImager. Cell Culture and Immunofluorescence—XTC-2 cells were grown on poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips in 61% Leibovitz's (L-15) medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. Caffeine-treated cells were incubated with 5 mm caffeine 90 min prior to aphidicolin treatment, where applicable. The cells were then incubated with 100 μm BrdUrd and 5 μg/ml aphidicolin where indicated. At 5.5 h, cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, and subjected to indirect immunofluorescence. For BrdUrd visualization, cells were re-fixed with 0.1% formaldehyde and incubated for 10 min in 2 m HCl and 0.1% Triton X-100 at room temperature. The acid was washed away, and the immunofluorescence procedure was repeated with anti-BrdUrd (Roche) as the primary antibody and Texas Red conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Laboratories) at a 1:500 dilution as the secondary antibody. The coverslips were washed (with 1 μg/ml Hoechst 33258 in the last wash) and mounted onto glass slides with Vectamount (Vector Laboratories). The samples were imaged with a SpotRT CCD camera (Diagnostic Instruments) and analyzed with Adobe Photoshop. Alkaline Gel Electrophoresis—Replication reactions (typically 40 μl of egg extract) were resuspended in 300 μl of StopN (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.5% SDS) containing 2 μg/ml RNase, and digested for 10 min at 37 °C. Proteinase K (200 μg/ml) was added, and samples were incubated for another 30 min at 37 °C. DNA was extracted twice with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (Sigma) and then precipitated with ethanol. Pellets were resuspended in 10 μl of 10 mm EDTA, and then diluted with an equal volume of 2× alkaline loading buffer (100 mm NaOH, 2 mm EDTA, 2.5% Ficoll, and 0.025% bromcresol green). Samples were loaded onto gels containing 1% agarose in 50 mm NaCl and 1 mm EDTA, and run overnight in alkaline gel running buffer (50 mm NaOH, 1 mm EDTA). Gels were fixed with 7% trichloroacetic acid, dried, and autoradiographed. Identification of a cDNA Encoding Xenopus Drf1—A Xenopus homologue from the Dbf4 family was cloned by first amplifying a 270-bp sequence with oligonucleotides designed to recognize a Xenopus expressed sequence tag with homology to Dbf4 proteins in other species. This fragment was then used to screen a Xenopus cDNA library to isolate the full-length open reading frame. Recently, a Xenopus Dbf4 sequence has been entered in the GenBank™ data base (accession no. AB095983). Our cloned protein shares significant sequence homology with this protein (28% identical) but represents a second, distinct Dbf4-like polypeptide (Fig. 1A). In humans, two Dbf4-like proteins have been identified, both of which activate Cdc7 (19Jiang W. McDonald D. Hope T.J. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5703-5713Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 42Montagnoli A. Bosotti R. Villa F. Rialland M. Brotherton D. Mercurio C. Berthelsen J. Santocanale C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3171-3181Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The cDNA that we have identified in Xenopus encodes a 772-amino acid protein that is homologous to both human proteins (32 and 26% identical to human Drf1 and ASK, respectively) but shares a higher identity with Drf1 (Fig. 1A). In comparison with other vertebrate Dbf4 proteins, Xdrf1 shares 29% identity with the hamster Dbf4 and 30% identity with the mouse Dbf4. Based on the sequence and the experimental evidence presented below, we believe that we have cloned a Dbf4-related factor, and have named this protein Xdrf1 (referred to hereafter as Drf1). Three distinct amino acid motifs have been described for the Dbf4 gene family: motifs N, M, and C (43Masai H. Arai K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 275: 228-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Motif N shares similarity to a BRCT-like domain and may be functionally important for the replication and DNA damage checkpoints; mutations in this region of the fission yeast homologue, Dfp1/Him1, do not affect the replication functions of the kinase but cause hypersensitivity to drugs that block DNA replication or damage DNA (44Ogino K. Takeda T. Matsui E. Iiyama H. Taniyama C. Arai K. Masai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31376-31387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Motif M consists of a proline-rich region, and motif C resembles a CCHH-type zinc finger motif (43Masai H. Arai K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 275: 228-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These two regions of Dfp1/Him1 are both necessary and sufficient for full activation of the kinase (44Ogino K. Takeda T. Matsui E. Iiyama H. Taniyama C. Arai K. Masai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31376-31387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). All three of these motifs are highly conserved in the Xenopus Drf1 protein (Fig. 1, B and C). Drf1 Is Dispensable for DNA Replication and Cdc45 Loading—We raised antibodies against an N-terminal fragment of the Xenopus Drf1 protein. This antibody efficiently detects the endogenous Drf1 protein by immunoblotting (Fig. 2A). Although the predicted molecular mass of Drf1 is 85 kDa, we found that the protein detected by two different antibodies raised against Drf1 migrated more slowly, at ∼150 kDa. Upon removal of Drf1 with anti-Drf1 antibodies, we observed that a significant amount of Cdc7 remained in the Drf1-depleted extract. Possible explanations are that there is a pool of free Cdc7 or that a second Dbf4-like protein may also form a complex with Cdc7, as is the case in human cells. To determine whether Drf1 is required for DNA synthesis, we depleted Drf1 from egg extracts and monitored the extent of DNA replication. We observed no defect in DNA replication in the absence of Drf1 compared with the mock-depleted or untreated extracts (Fig. 2B). This result contrasts with the nearly complete inhibition of replication that has been reported for depletion of the Xenopus Cdc7 protein (9Jares P. Blow J.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1528-1540PubMed Google Scholar, 38Roberts B.T. Ying C.Y. Gautier J. Maller J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2800-2804Cr"
https://openalex.org/W2014834877,"Oxidative stress generated during ischemia/reperfusion injury has been shown to augment cellular responsiveness. Whereas oxidants are themselves known to induce several intracellular signaling cascades, their effect on signaling pathways initiated by other inflammatory stimuli remains poorly elucidated. Previous work has suggested that oxidants are able to prime alveolar macrophages for increased NF-κB translocation in response to treatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Because oxidants are known to stimulate the Src family of tyrosine kinases, we hypothesized that the oxidants might contribute to augmented NF-κB translocation by LPS via the involvement of Src family kinases. To model macrophage priming in vitro, the murine macrophage cell line, RAW 264.7, was first incubated with various oxidants and then exposed to low dose LPS. These studies show that oxidant stress is able to augment macrophage responsiveness to LPS as evidenced by earlier and increased NF-κB translocation. Inhibition of the Src family kinases by either pharmacological inhibition using PP2 or through a molecular approach by cell transfection with Csk was found to prevent the augmented LPS-induced NF-κB translocation caused by oxidants. Interestingly, while Src kinase inhibition was able to prevent the LPS-induced NF-κB translocation in oxidant-treated macrophages, this strategy had no effect on NF-κB translocation caused by LPS in the absence of oxidants. These findings suggested that oxidative stress might divert LPS signaling along an alternative signaling pathway. Further studies demonstrated that the Src-dependent pathway induced by oxidant pretreatment involved the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Involvement of this pathway appeared to be independent of traditional LPS signaling. Together, these studies provide a novel potential mechanism whereby oxidants might prime alveolar macrophages for altered responsiveness to subsequent inflammatory stimuli and suggest different cellular targets for immunomodulation following ischemia/reperfusion.

Civilian trauma remains a leading cause of disability and mortality in North American society (1MacKenzie E.J. Morris Jr., J.A. Smith G.S. Fahey M. J. Trauma. 1990; 30: 1096-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Late deaths are related to the development of multiple organ failure in up to two-thirds of these patients. Many studies have suggested that the global ischemia-reperfusion resulting from resuscitated hemorrhagic shock predisposes to organ injury by priming for an exaggerated immune response to a delayed inflammatory stimulus (2Moore F.A. Moore E.E. Surg. Clin. North Am. 1995; 75: 257-277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). The synergistic effect of sequential stimuli has been coined the “two-hit” hypothesis for the development of organ injury in trauma patients (2Moore F.A. Moore E.E. Surg. Clin. North Am. 1995; 75: 257-277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar).

Ischemia/reperfusion produces oxidative stress through the irreversible conversion of xanthine dehydrogenase to xanthine oxidase (XO) during ischemia with consequent production of oxygen-free radicals and H2O2 during reperfusion (4McCord J.M.

Physiol. 1990; 258: H1415-H1419PubMed Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest a role for oxidative stress as contributing to activation of hematopoietic cells. In the in vitro setting, oxidants have been shown to induce activation of multiple signaling pathways in hematopoietic cells. The best studied of these involves signaling cascades culminating in NF-κB translocation and induction of transcription of NF-κB-dependent genes. Early reports documented the ability of oxidants to induce NF-κB translocation and also defined the role of oxidant stress in NF-κB translocation by various inflammatory stimuli including LPS and tumor necrosis factor. In vivo studies have generally supported a role for oxidative stress in the induction of NF-κB translocation following ischemia/reperfusion. Schwartz et al. (6Schwartz M.D. Repine J.E. Abraham E. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1995; 12: 434-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) reported that inhibition of xanthine oxidase generation or activity using a tungsten-enriched diet or allopurinol, respectively, prevented induction of NF-κB-dependent gene expression such as tumor necrosis factor in a murine hemorrhagic shock model. The potential priming role of oxidant stress generated by ischemia/reperfusion is well demonstrated in our previous reports. In these studies, neither shock/resuscitation nor low dose LPS was able to induce significant NF-κB translocation in alveolar macrophages, whereas the combined presence of these two stimuli culminated in a robust response, far greater than the additive effect of the separate responses. Importantly, supplementation of resuscitation fluid with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine prevented the synergistic rise in NF-κB translocation (3Fan J. Marshall J.C. Jimenez M. Shek P.N. Zagorski J. Rotstein O.D. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 440-447PubMed Google Scholar). These observations are consistent with a role for oxidative stress in the priming of macrophages for increased responsiveness to a delayed second inflammatory stimulus. However, whereas oxidative stress is known to activate a number of signaling pathways in inflammatory cells, the alterations in cell signaling leading to enhanced responsiveness following exposure to oxidants have not been elucidated. The Src family of tyrosine kinases are involved in many signal transduction pathways. The Src tyrosine kinases have been shown to be activated by oxidant stress such as UV irradiation as well as H2O2 (7Aikawa R. Komuro I. Yamazaki T. Zou Y. Kudoh S. Tanaka M. Shiojima I. Hiroi Y. Yazaki Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1813-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar, 8Devary Y. Gottlieb R.A. Smeal T. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 71: 1081-1091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). Relevant to the activation of NF-κB and induction of NF-κB-dependent proinflammatory genes, Src has also been shown to phosphorylate inhibitory κB (IκB) on tyrosine residues, an event that activates NF-κB without inducing IκB degradation itself (9Imbert V. Farahifar D. Auberger P. Mary D. Rossi B. Peyron J.F. J. Inflamm. 1996; 46: 65-77PubMed Google Scholar). In the present studies, we tested the hypothesis that oxidant stress might contribute to augmented NF-κB translocation in response to LPS through involvement of members of the Src family kinases. To examine this hypothesis, an in vitro culture system was established wherein macrophages were sequentially exposed to an oxidative stress followed by LPS as a means of modeling the in vivo “two-hit hypothesis” of cellular activation and organ injury following shock/resuscitation. The major findings in the present studies are that Src family kinases are not only involved in macrophage priming by oxidants, but also that antecedent oxidant stress reprograms LPS-NF-κB signaling such that it changes from a Src-independent pathway to one that is Src-dependent.

The polyclonal anti-IκBα, anti-phosphotyrosine-specific monoclonal antibody (G410), PI 3-kinase antibody (clone UB93-3), and an in vitro tyrosine kinase assay kit were purchased from Upstate Biochemical Institute (Lake Placid, NY). An inhibitor of the Src family of proteintyrosine kinases, PP2, was purchased from Calbiochem, Inc. (San Diego, CA). The PI substrate was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Alabaster, AL). The Protein A-Sepharose beads, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody, and ECL were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. The 50× protease inhibitor mixture was purchased from BD Pharmingen (San Jose, CA). The TLC plates and ATP were obtained from Sigma. Endotoxin-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Hanks' balanced salt solution were purchased from Invitrogen; fetal calf serum was from Hyclone. Cell Preparation—The murine macrophage cell line, RAW 264.7 (ATCC), was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin (P/S), and 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Cell Activation—Experiments were carried out in Hanks' balanced salt solution, 2% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glucose. The cells were exposed to XO (50 milliunits/ml), LPS (0.1 μg/ml), or a combination of pretreatment with XO for 2 h and then LPS (Escherichia coli O111:B4) treatment ranging from 0.5 min to 1 h. Alternatively, the oxidant H2O2 (100 μm) was used instead of the XO prior to LPS exposure. Reactions were stopped by placing the cells on ice. In inhibition studies, RAW cells were preincubated in the presence of 10 μm PP2 for 10 min at 37 °C. Transient Transfections—Twenty-four hours after plating the cells on culture dishes, cotransfections were performed using green fluorescent protein (GFP) pFR-hrGFP plasmid (Stratagene) and Csk plasmid. The Csk plasmid was a kind gift from Dr. I. Mucsi (Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary). The full-length coding sequence of murine Csk was subcloned into pcDNA3 vector using HindIII and XbaI restriction enzymes. Transient transfection with the corresponding plasmids was performed using Superfect reagent (Qiagen Ltd.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Routinely, cells were transfected with 4 μg of plasmid DNA per well (for 6-well plates). The DNA was diluted in OptiMEM medium (Invitrogen). The ratio of total plasmid DNA to Superfect reagent was 4 μgto20 μl, respectively. After3hof incubation the medium containing the remaining complexes was removed and replaced with fresh growth medium with 10% fetal calf serum and P/S. Stable Transfection of Cell Line—Stable transfection of RAW 264.7 cell lines expressing Csk were kindly provided by Dr. Z. Honda (University of Tokyo, Japan) (10Suzuki T. Kono H. Hirose N. Okada M. Yamamoto T. Yamamoto K. Honda Z. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 473-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, P/S, and neomycin antibiotic G418 (Invitrogen). Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from cells using the guanidium-isothiocyanate method (11Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Hybridization was conducted using a [γ-32P]dATP end-labeled 30-base oligonucleotide probe for CINC with the sequence 5′-GCGGCATCACCTTCAAACTCTGGATGTTCT-3′, which is complementary to nucleotides 134–164 of CINC cDNA (kindly provided by Dr. Timothy S. Blackwell, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN) (12Blackwell T.S. Blackwell T.R. Holden E.P. Christman B.W. Christman J.W. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 1630-1637PubMed Google Scholar). Blots were then washed under conditions of high stringency, and specific mRNA bands were detected by autoradiography in the presence of intensifying screens. Blots were stripped and reprobed for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, which is a ubiquitously expressed housekeeping gene to control for loading. Expression of mRNA was quantitated using a PhosphorImager and accompanying ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences), and was normalized to the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase signal. Immunoprecipitation—After treatments, cells were lysed for 5 min on ice with buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 30 mm Hepes, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm EGTA, and 1% Triton X-100 to which protease mixture inhibitor had been added. Cell lysates were then centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatants were then collected and precleared with protein A-Sepharose beads. Equal amounts of cellular proteins were immunocomplexed with 2 μg of rabbit polyclonal anti-IκBα, anti-Hck, anti-Fgr, or anti-Lyn antibody for 1 h rotating at 4 °C. Subsequently, 30 μg of protein A-Sepharose beads were added to the samples and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. The resulting immune complexes were washed three times with the same lysis buffer and then resuspended in 25 μl of Laemmli buffer. Western Blot Analysis—Cells were pelleted and lysed in ice-cold cell lysis buffer. Whole cell lysates were prepared with 2× Laemmli, 0.1 m dithiothreitol buffer followed by immediate boiling at 100 °C for 5 min. Cytosolic fractions were isolated with 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Postnuclear supernatants were collected following centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 5 min and diluted with 2× Laemmli buffer, 0.1 m dithiothreitol followed by immediate boiling for 5 min. Lysates prepared from 100,000 cells were separated on 12.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Blots were then probed with 1:1000 dilution of anti-phosphotyrosine-specific monoclonal antibody (G410), anti-IκBα antibody, or anti-phosphospecific antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Following incubation with the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey IgG secondary antibody at 1:3000 dilution for 1 h at room temperature, blots were developed using an ECL-based system. Tyrosine Kinase Assay—Immunoprecipitation of Hck was performed as previously described. The tyrosine kinase assay kit (non-radioactive) was used. Biotinylated substrate peptide containing poly(Glu4-Tyr) was incubated with the tyrosine kinase, in the presence of non-radioactive ATP. PP2 (10 μm) was added to the kinase reaction. The reaction was then placed in a microplate coated with streptavidin. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody was used to detect the phosphorylated substrate. Chemiluminescence was used for colorimetric detection with a spectrophotometric plate reader set at wavelength of 450 nm. Reference wells were used to determine the amount of peptide/well. PI 3-Kinase Activity Assay—After treatments, cells were lysed with 600 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 30 mm Hepes, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm EGTA, and 1% Triton X-100 to which protease mixture inhibitor had been added. Samples were left on ice for 10 min then cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The lysates were further incubated overnight with 5 μl of PI 3-kinase antibody at 4 °C and then coupled to 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4 °C on a rotator. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with buffer containing 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.25), 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 m Na3VO4. Reaction was then performed as previously described (13Lioubin M.N. Algate P.A. Tsai S. Carlberg K. Aebersold A. Rohrschneider L.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1084-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Briefly the immunoprecipitates were resuspended in 30 μl of the same buffer to which 1× protease mixture inhibitor has been added in a reaction mixture containing the 30 μl of beads in 70 μm ATP, 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 5 μg of l-α-phosphatidylinositol, mixed gently, and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped with 20 μl of 6 n HCl and the organic layer was extracted with 160 μl of CHCl3/CH3OH (1:1) and separated on a silica gel thin layer chromatography plate in solvent containing CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O/NH4OH (60:47:11.3:2). Radiolabeled phosphatidylinositol phosphates were visualized by autoradiography on X-Omat film. Nuclear Protein Extraction—Nuclear protein extracts were prepared from the cells by the method of Deryckere and Gannon (14Deryckere F. Gannon F. BioTechniques. 1994; 16: 405PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were resuspended in 1 ml of solution A (150 mmol/liter NaCl, 10 mmol/liter Hepes, pH 7.9, 1 mmol/liter EDTA, and 0.5 mmol/liter phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The cells were centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 5 min and resuspended in solution A + 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Cells were incubated on ice for 10 min, vortexed gently, and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min. Nuclear pellets were resuspended in 30 μl of solution B (25% glycerol, 20 mmol/liter Hepes, pH 7.9, 420 mmol/liter NaCl, 1.2 mmol/liter MgCl2, 0.2 mmol/liter EDTA, 0.5 mmol/liter dithiothreitol, 0.5 mmol/liter phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mmol/liter benzamidine, 5 μg/ml aprotinin) and incubated on ice for 15 min. Nuclei were then obtained by centrifugation at 13,000 × g, and proteins were measured with the Bio-Rad protein assay dye reagent (Bio-Rad). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—The probe used for EMSA is a 30-bp double-stranded construct (5′-CCTGTGCTCCGGGAATTTCCCTGGCCTGGA-3′) corresponding to a sequence (–72 to –42) in the CINC-proximal promoter region containing the NF-κB motif (12Blackwell T.S. Blackwell T.R. Holden E.P. Christman B.W. Christman J.W. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 1630-1637PubMed Google Scholar). End labeling was performed by T4 kinase in the presence of [γ-32P]dATP. Labeled oligonucleotides were purified on a Sephadex G-50M column (Amersham Biosciences). An aliquot of 5 μg of nuclear protein was incubated with the labeled double-stranded probe (∼50,000 cpm) in the presence of 5 μg of nonspecific blocker, poly(dI-dC) in binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) at 25 °C for 20 min. Specific competition was performed by adding 100 ng of unlabeled double-stranded CINC oligonucleotide probe to the nuclear extract from the sample with the greatest nuclear binding. The mixture was separated by electrophoresis on a 5% polyacrylamide gel in 1× Tris glycine/EDTA buffer. Gels were vacuum dried and subjected to autoradiography. Immunofluorescence Microcopy—RAW 264.7 cells were allowed to adhere to autoclaved glass coverslips overnight at 37 °C in 5% CO2, incubated in previously outline experimental conditions. Cells were fixed for 30 min in PBS supplemented with 2% paraformaldehyde. The coverslips were washed three times with PBS for 10 min each, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min, and then blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. The samples were stained with goat anti-p65 polyclonal primary antibodies (1:50 dilution in PBS) for 1 h at room temperature, washed three times with PBS for 5 min each, and incubated with fluorescently labeled Alexa 555 donkey anti-goat IgG secondary antibodies (1:400 dilution in PBS) (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR) for 1 h at room temperature. Nuclei were counterstained with 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole chromosomal staining (Molecular Probes Inc.). The coverslips were mounted on glass slides using DAKO solution, from Dakocytomation (Carpinteria, CA). The staining was visualized using a Nikon TE200 fluorescence microscope (×100 objective) coupled to a Orca 100 camera (Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan) driven by Simple PCI software (Compix Inc., Imaging Systems, Cranberry Township, PA). Immunofluorescence data analysis for single cell assays involved calculating a ratio of translocated to non-translocated cells, with an average of 100 cells counted for each group. The percentage of transfected cells was determined by counting the number of GFP transfected to non-GFP transfected cells. Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. of three independent studies. When blots are shown, they are representative of at least three independent studies. For statistical comparison, the means were compared using analysis of variance by Student's t test (SPSS Software, Chicago, IL). A probability value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. Effect of Oxidative Stress on Macrophages Responsiveness—To examine the effect of oxidants on LPS responsiveness, H2O2 was examined for its effect on LPS-induced NF-κB translocation. As shown in Fig. 1A, low dose H2O2 (100 μm), which itself was able to provoke only a modest delayed NF-κB translocation, significantly enhanced the ability of LPS to induce NF-κB translocation, both by inducing an earlier response as well as a heightened response during the LPS stimulation period. Fig. 1B illustrates a dose response of the effect of varying doses of H2O2 on LPS-induced NF-κB translocation. At t = 30 min of LPS stimulation, H2O2 ranging from 15 to 100 μm was able to augment LPS-induced NF-κB translocation. The higher doses of H2O2 alone caused modest NF-κB translocation in this model, whereas 1000 μm resulted in cytotoxicity. The dose of LPS chosen in these studies was based on its ability to induce relatively slow and modest changes in NF-κB translocation, as a means of highlighting the ability of oxidants to augment this activation. Xanthine oxidase is a proximal generator of oxidants following ischemia/reperfusion and was also tested for its ability to augment LPS responsiveness. In Fig. 1C, cells were exposed to XO (50 milliunits/ml) alone, LPS (0.1 μg/ml) alone, or the combination of pretreatment with XO followed by LPS treatment. Whereas XO pretreatment alone induced little NF-κB translocation, it markedly augmented the responsiveness to LPS at all time points studied. XO doses from 25 to 500 milliunits/ml were studied and optimal priming occurred at the 100 milliunits/ml concentration (data not shown). Because CINC gene expression is dependent on NF-κB translocation and its transcription is augmented in vivo by shock plus LPS (3Fan J. Marshall J.C. Jimenez M. Shek P.N. Zagorski J. Rotstein O.D. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 440-447PubMed Google Scholar), we evaluated a functional correlate of the increased NF-κB translocation in this model by following the expression of the chemokine CINC. Pretreatment of cells with XO significantly enhanced levels of CINC mRNA expression following LPS treatment compared with LPS alone (Fig. 1D). The levels of CINC mRNA following XO treatment alone were modestly increased compared with control levels. Together, these studies established a cellular model of oxidant priming for increased LPS responsiveness, representing an in vitro correlate of the priming of alveolar macrophages observed after shock/resuscitation in vivo. Based on the dose-response studies, we chose to use 100 μm H2O2 as the priming dose of oxidative stress in subsequent experiments. Oxidants Augment Tyrosine Phosphorylation of the Src Family Members—To determine whether members of the Src family of kinases might contribute to oxidant-induced signaling, we evaluated tyrosine phosphorylation as a measure of their activation. The three major Src family members expressed in the macrophage are Hck, Fgr, and Lyn (15Lowell C.A. Soriano P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1845-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). H2O2 (100 μm) induced phosphotyrosine accumulation in all three of these kinases within 10 min following exposure (Fig. 2). Therefore, the ability of oxidative stress to cause tyrosine phosphorylation of the three Src kinases is consistent with their potential contribution to the activation of downstream signaling (16Mallozzi C. Di Stasi M.A. Minetti M. Free Radical Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 1108-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To examine the role of Src kinases in the oxidant-induced priming of LPS signaling, we utilized the agent PP2, a potent and selective pharmacological inhibitor of the Src family of tyrosine kinases (17Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1790) Google Scholar). An in vitro kinase assay was performed to confirm the ability for PP2 to prevent the activation of Src kinase. Hck kinase activity was totally blocked by the addition of 10 μm PP2 (n = 2 studies). Ten min pretreatment with PP2 significantly attenuated H2O2/LPS-induced translocation of NF-κB seen at 30 min (Fig. 3). The inactive analogue of PP2, PP3 had no inhibitory effect (data not shown). In addition, pretreatment of macrophages with PP2 prior to treatment with LPS alone did not inhibit LPS-induced NF-κB translocation and was occasionally mildly stimulatory, as illustrated in Fig. 3. These findings imply that, in agreement with previous data, Src kinases are not required for NF-κB translocation induced by LPS in the absence of oxidative stress (18Meng F. Lowell C.A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1661-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Together, these studies suggest that oxidant pretreatment may alter the LPS signaling pathway such that it critically involves Src kinases. H2O2 Augments LPS-induced p65 Nuclear Translocation—As an alternative approach to examining the effect of oxidant stress on LPS signaling, we used immunofluorescence (IF) microscopy to investigate nuclear translocation of p65 as a surrogate for NF-κB translocation. Fig. 4A shows a time course of the effect of H2O2 on LPS-induced p65 nuclear translocation where 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining was used to verify nuclear localization of p65. Nuclear p65 translocation was observed by 5–20 min in response to LPS plus H2O2 pretreatment, whereas neither H2O2 nor LPS alone induced translocation at these time points. By 30 to 45 min, p65 translocation was observed in both LPS- and H2O2/LPS-treated cells. These findings reproduce those observed for the EMSA, in that the combination of H2O2/LPS induced an earlier translocation of p65 compared with LPS alone. However, they differ somewhat insofar as the EMSA also demonstrated an increased magnitude of nuclear translocation, whereas the immunofluorescence studies did not. This is likely a result of the fact that the degree of p65 translocation detected by immunofluorescence is poorly quantitated, compared with translocation of binding proteins in the EMSA. Nevertheless, the major finding that oxidant exposure primes for earlier LPS-stimulated NF-κB translocation is common to both methods. Having demonstrated the ability of this model to mimic the findings observed in the cell populations, several approaches were taken to substantiate the contributions of the Src family kinases i"
https://openalex.org/W1997393721,"Retinoids, the natural and synthetic derivatives of vitamin A, have a role in cancer treatment and prevention. There is a need to reveal mechanisms that account for retinoid response or resistance. This study identified candidate all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) target genes linked to growth suppression in BEAS-2B human bronchial epithelial cells. Microarray analyses were performed using Affymetrix arrays. A total of 11 RA-induced species were validated by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Western or Northern analyses. Three of these species were novel candidate RA-target genes in human bronchial epithelial cells. These included: placental bone morphogenetic protein (PLAB), polyamine oxidase isoform 1 (PAOh1) and E74-like factor 3 (ELF3). Expression patterns were studied in RA-resistant BEAS-2B-R1 cells. In BEAS-2B-R1 cells, RA dysregulated the expression of the putative lymphocyte G0/G1 switch gene (G0S2), heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1), tumor necrosis factor-α-induced protein 2 (TNFAIP2), inhibitor of DNA binding 1(Id1), fos-like antigen 1 (FOSL1), transglutaminase 2 (TGM2), asparagine synthetase (ASNS), PLAB, PAOh1 and ELF3, while prominent induction of insulin-like growth-factor-binding protein 6 (IGFBP6) still occurred. In summary, this study identified 11 candidate RA-target genes in human bronchial epithelial cells including three novel species. Expression studies in BEAS-2B-R1 cells indicated that several were directly implicated in RA signaling, since their aberrant expression was linked to RA resistance of human bronchial epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2151527151,"Type 1 plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) is the primary inhibitor of tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA). Whereas PAI-1 is not expressed in normal kidneys, it is strongly induced in glomerular diseases and thus could promote the local accumulation of fibrin. To study the role of PAI-1 in the development of inflammatory glomerular injury, passive antiglomerular basement membrane (GBM) glomerulonephritis (GN) was induced in PAI-1 knockout mice and in wild-type mice of the same genetic background. Unexpectedly, PAI-1 deficiency was associated with an early and severe exacerbation of glomerular injury: Infiltration by CD4 T cells, proportion of fibrinous crescents, and renal function impairment were significantly more pronounced in PAI-1 -/- mice. Interestingly, activation of transforming growth factor (TGF)- beta, which is known to be dependent on the PA/plasmin system in vitro, was dramatically enhanced in the kidneys in the absence of PAI-1. Moreover, administration of neutralizing antibodies against TGF-beta significantly attenuated the disease in PAI-1 -/- mice. This suggests that the poor outcome of GN in PAI-1 -/- mice is consecutive to an uncontrolled activation of TGF-beta and confers PAI-1 with a new, immunomodulatory role."

ACF expression is predominantly nuclear, including mutant proteins with deletions of a putative nuclear localization signal. We have now identified a novel 41-residue motif (ANS) in the auxiliary domain of ACF that functions as an authentic nuclear localization signal. ANS-green fluorescence protein and ANS-β-galactosidase chimeras were both expressed exclusively in the nucleus, whereas wild-type chimeras or an ACF deletion mutant lacking the ANS were cytoplasmic.

On the other hand, apobec-1 is found in a predominantly cytoplasmic or perinuclear distribution in transfected cells (4Blanc V. Henderson J.O. Kennedy S. Davidson N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46386-46393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 7Blanc V. Navaratnam N. Henderson J.O. Anant S. Kennedy S. Jarmuz A. Scott J. Davidson N.O. J. Biol.

A. 1997; 94: 13075-13080Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In examining the cytoplasmic distribution of apobec-1, recent studies concluded that neither the putative bipartite nuclear localization sequence (NLS) nor the predicted nuclear export signal in the carboxyl terminus of apobec-1 was functional in directing import or export of a reporter (14Yang Y. Sowden M.P. Smith H.C. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 267: 153-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Thus, the mechanism by which apobec-1 is transported to the nucleus and the signals by which this process is directed remain unknown. Because C to U editing of the nuclear apoB transcript requires a physical interaction between ACF and apobec-1 (4Blanc V. Henderson J.O. Kennedy S. Davidson N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46386-46393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), these two proteins must presumably exist in the same subcellular compartment (i.e. the nucleus) to effect deamination of the targeted base in apoB mRNA (13Yang Y. Smith H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13075-13080Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This assumption is supported by the demonstration that co-expression of apobec-1 with ACF results in the redistribution of apobec-1 to the nucleus (4Blanc V. Henderson J.O. Kennedy S. Davidson N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46386-46393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 7Blanc V. Navaratnam N. Henderson J.O. Anant S. Kennedy S. Jarmuz A. Scott J. Davidson N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10272-10283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). By contrast, co-expression of an ACF mutant that lacks the apobec-1 interaction domain along with wild-type apobec-1 reveals that apobec-1 remains cytoplasmic, whereas the ACF mutant localizes to the nucleus (4Blanc V. Henderson J.O. Kennedy S. Davidson N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46386-46393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These observations raise the possibility that, in addition to its requisite function in the enzymatic catalysis of C to U deamination, ACF may also regulate apoB mRNA editing by controlling nuclear accumulation of apobec-1 through protein-protein interactions and directed intracellular trafficking. A putative, SV-40 type NLS motif (PKTKKRE) is present in the amino-terminal portion of ACF, overlapping the second RNA recognition motif (RRM2). Point mutations or deletion of this motif, however, failed to alter nuclear distribution of the mutant ACF, suggesting that another active NLS domain directs nuclear import (4Blanc V. Henderson J.O. Kennedy S. Davidson N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46386-46393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In this study we have characterized a functional NLS located in the auxiliary domain of ACF. The function of this motif and the regulation of nuclear-cytoplasmic transport of ACF and the ACF-apobec-1 complex is the focus of this report. Plasmid Constructs and Protein Expression—The construction of the ACF deletion mutants has been previously described (4Blanc V. Henderson J.O. Kennedy S. Davidson N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46386-46393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The ΔANS-ACF deletion mutant was cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pCMV2B using the restriction sites BamHI and XhoI. All the green fluorescence protein (GFP) fusion proteins were constructed following a two-step PCR method (15Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). The full-length PCR products were sequenced and subcloned into the pEGFP-N1 vector (Clontech) using KpnI-BamHI sites. This cloning generates an NH2-terminal GFP fusion protein. The ANS-β-galactosidase fusion was constructed following a two-step PCR strategy using pTYB1-ACF and pSV-β-galactosidase vector (Promega) as template. The full-length PCR product was inserted into pCMV2B vector (Stratagene) using the BamHI-XhoI restriction sites. Importin-α, transportin 1, and transportin 2 (Trn2) were cloned following PCR amplification and inserted into pCMV2B or -3B vectors (Stratagene). This cloning resulted, respectively, in the expression of an NH2-terminal FLAG or Myc-tagged fusion protein. Trn2 recombinant protein was expressed as a GST fusion (a generous gift of I. Gallouzi, McGill University) and purified to homogeneity using glutathione-Sepharose 4B affinity chromatography as recommended by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). After extensive washes, the recombinant protein was eluted in the presence of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm reduced glutathione, 120 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors and dialyzed against Dignam D buffer (7Blanc V.

Protein-Protein Interaction Studies—COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with 2 μg of plasmid encoding FLAG-tagged wild-type ACF, ΔANS-ACF, or HuR (a generous gift of I. Gallouzi, McGill University). 48 h post-transfection, cell lysates were prepared in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor mix. Each extract was treated with RNase A for 30 min at room temperature and loaded on GST or GST-Trn2-coupled glutathione-Sepharose beads for 12 h at 4 °C. The unbound material was washed with 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl. Bound proteins were eluted with 2× Laemmli loading buffer, fractionated through SDS-10% PAGE, and analyzed by Western blotting using rabbit anti-FLAG antibody (Affinity BioReagents, Inc.). In vitro translation of epitope-tagged constructs encoding importin-α, transportin 1, transportin 2, FLAG-tagged ACF, ΔANS-ACF, or FLAG-ANS was conducted as described previously using TnT coupled reticulocyte lysate (Promega). 35S-radiolabeled Trn2 protein was mixed with unlabeled FLAG-tagged ACF, ΔANS-ACF, or ANS, and the complex was recovered by immobilization on immune-coupled protein A beads (4Blanc V.

Transfection, Immunofluorescence, and Confocal Microscopy—COS-7 cells, HeLa cells, and NIH3T3 (ATCC) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium as described previously (7Blanc V. Navaratnam N. Henderson J.O. Anant S. Kennedy S. Jarmuz A. Scott J. Davidson N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10272-10283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Where indicated, cells were incubated with actinomycin D (AMD) (Sigma) at 10 μg/ml for 3 h or as indicated in the relevant figure legend. In some experiments, cells were treated with leptomycin B (LMB) at 10 ng/ml (a generous gift from Dr. Minoru Yoshida, RIKEN Institute, Japan) (16Kudo N. Taoka H. Toda T. Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 14649-14657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) for 6 h before fixation and staining. Cycloheximide (Sigma) was used where indicated for 3 h at 20 μg/ml to inhibit protein synthesis. COS-7 cells were grown to 50–60% confluency on glass coverslips. The cells were transiently transfected with 2 μg of appropriate eukaryotic expression vector using 6 μl of FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). 48 h after transfection, cells were fixed with 10% formalin solution (Sigma), permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100, and probed with rabbit anti-FLAG IgG and/or mouse monoclonal anti-Myc IgG followed by Cy3 secondary antibody or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch). For standard immunofluorescence microscopy, nuclei were identified using 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Vector). Slides were examined using a Zeiss Axiashop 2 MOT microscope equipped with a 40× plan neofluar objective and a 3-CCR camera (DAGE-MTI, Inc.). A Zeiss Attoarc variable intensity lamp was used with filter sets designed for Cy3 and 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. For confocal microscopy, nuclei were detected using TO-PRO3 iodide (Molecular Probes, Oregon). Preparations were visualized using a 63× Zeiss plane apochromatic objective and a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 confocal adaptor. A krypton-argon laser was used with epifluorescence filter sets designed for Texas Red (Cy3), fluorescein isothiocyanate, and cyanine (Cy5). The confocal aperture was set at 1.8. Usually, 4–8 images at planes separated by 0.5 μm were collected. Images were processed using Adobe Photoshop 4.0 software. Heterokaryon Assay—The interspecies human-mouse heterokaryons were generated as described previously (18Fan X.C. Steitz J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15293-15298Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, HeLa cells grown on 60-mm dishes were transfected with 3 μg of plasmid expressing amino-terminal FLAG-tagged ACF using 25-μl Polyfect (Qiagen). 24 h after transfection, HeLa cells were seeded onto coverslips in 35-mm dishes at 3 × 105 cells/coverslip. After overnight incubation, NIH3T3 cells preincubated for 30 min in the presence of 100 μg/ml cycloheximide were seeded onto the same coverslips at 3 × 105 cells/coverslip. The co-cultures were grown for 3 h with 100 μg/ml cycloheximide and then were fused in the presence of 50% polyethylene glycol 3350 (Sigma) for 3 min. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, cultured in the same medium containing 100 μg/ml cycloheximide for 3 h, and fixed for immunostaining as described above. To visualize the HeLa-NIH3T3 heterokaryon, Hoechst dye 33258 (Sigma) was used at 1 μg/ml during the incubation with the secondary antibody to permit discrimination between human and murine nuclei (18Fan X.C. Steitz J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15293-15298Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). ACF Has a Non-conserved Nuclear Import Sequence in the COOH-terminal Auxiliary Domain—Previous studies demonstrated that deletion of the putative SV-40 type NLS in the amino-terminal domain of ACF (2Mehta A. Kinter M.T. Sherman N.E. Driscoll D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1846-1854Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 3Lellek H. Kirsten R. Diehl I. Apostel F. Buck F. Greeve J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19848-19856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A) failed to alter its nuclear distribution (4Blanc V. Henderson J.O. Kennedy S. Davidson N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46386-46393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Thus, to identify the active NLS within ACF we constructed a series of deletion mutants spanning the entire protein (Fig. 1B). Each mutant was transiently expressed in COS-7 cells, and its intracellular distribution was examined by immunofluorescence microscopy. Most of these deletion mutants revealed a nuclear staining pattern indistinguishable from wild-type ACF (Fig. 1B). However, there were two exceptions, mutants Δ-(331–385) and Δ-(380–402), which appeared cytoplasmic (Fig. 1B). These results suggested that the region spanning residues 331–402 may contain an NLS. Further deletion mapping (data not shown) indicated that the region spanning residues 360–401 contains the minimal nuclear localization sequence. A mutant ACF construct with an internal deletion spanning residues 360–401 showed a cytoplasmic, perinuclear localization pattern when expressed in COS-7 cells (data not shown). Sequence alignment of the region spanning residues 360–401 revealed no clusters of basic residues suggestive of a canonical SV-40 type or bipartite NLS. Furthermore, this region revealed no homology with either the NLS consensus of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNP) A1 or hnRNP K (M9 and KNS, respectively) or with the HNS (HuR nuclear localization signal) in HuR (Fig. 1C). We will heretofore refer to this apparently novel motif (residues 360–401 of ACF) as ANS for ACF nuclear localization sequence. The Nuclear Localization Signal of ACF Is Functional—To confirm that the ANS domain is functional, we examined its capacity to restrict nuclear expression of GFP. Expression of wild-type GFP revealed diffuse fluorescence throughout the cell, including the cytoplasm and nucleus (Fig. 2a). When expressed as a (331–402)-GFP fusion protein, fluorescence was restricted to the nucleus (Fig. 2b). This observation suggests that the ANS domain is biologically active in nuclear targeting. We further investigated if the minimal ANS (i.e. residues 360–401) could function to target a large, heterologous protein such as β-galactosidase to the nucleus. Accordingly, an epitope-tagged ANS-β-galactosidase chimera was expressed, and its subcellular localization was determined by examining both protein activity and immunohistochemical distribution. The wild-type construct demonstrated the expected perinuclear distribution, whereas the ANS-β-galactosidase chimera was efficiently targeted to the nucleus (Fig. 3, A and B). These findings collectively suggest that the ANS functionally directs protein import into the nucleus, both in cis as well as in trans.Fig. 3ANS mediates β-galactosidase nuclear localization. A, the ANS motif (residues 360–401) was cloned upstream of the β-galactosidase gene under the control of a cytomegalovirus promoter. The plasmid expressing amino-terminal FLAG-tagged ANS-β-galactosidase was transiently expressed into COS-7 cells. Forty-eight hours post-transfection cells were fixed, and a β-galactosidase staining was performed showing a dominant staining in the nucleus (c and d). Rather, COS-7 cells transfected with a plasmid expressing β-galactosidase reveal a cytoplasmic staining (a and b). A pCMV empty vector was used as control of background β-galactosidase activity (e). B, determination of nuclear localization of ANS-β-galactosidase by immunofluorescence staining. COS-7 cells were transfected with plasmids expressing either amino-terminal FLAG-tagged β-galactosidase (a and b) or FLAG-tagged ANS-β-galactosidase (c and d). Cells were fixed and immunostained using anti-FLAG IgG. Nuclei were identified by DAPI staining. This is representative of three independent assays.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) ACF Can Redistribute between the Nucleus and Cytoplasm— Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis suggest that ACF is distantly related to hnRNPs, some of which continuously shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm (19Michael W.M. Choi M. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1995; 83: 415-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). These studies used the RNA polymerase II inhibitor AMD to demonstrate transcription dependence of hnRNP shuttling (20Pinol-Roma S. Dreyfuss G. Nature. 1992; 355: 730-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). To examine the transcription dependence of ACF distribution, COS-7 cells were treated with AMD for 3 h, which revealed a shift in distribution of ACF from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (Fig. 4, panel A). There was no effect on the nuclear localization of ACF when cells were treated with cycloheximide (20 μg/ml) (Fig. 4B). These findings suggest that the cytoplasmic accumulation of ACF after AMD treatment was likely the result of transcription inhibition rather than defects in protein synthesis. To further determine whether the cytoplasmic accumulation of ACF observed after AMD treatment reflects increased nuclear export, we treated cells with LMB, a specific inhibitor of CRM1 (21Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1741) Google Scholar, 22Fukuda M. Asano S. Nakamura T. Adachi M. Yoshida M. Yanagida M. Nishida E. Nature. 1997; 390: 308-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar), both alone and in the presence of AMD. These experiments revealed that LMB abolished the cytoplasmic redistribution of ACF previously observed with AMD (Fig. 4A). These findings, thus, suggest that ACF translocates across the nuclear envelope via a CRM1-dependent pathway. In view of the recent findings by Smith and co-workers (14Yang Y. Sowden M.P. Smith H.C. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 267: 153-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) that apobec-1 does not accumulate in the nucleus of LMB-treated cells, the current results strongly imply that the nuclear export of ACF is at least partially independent of apobec-1. We will return to this point below. Cytoplasmic redistribution of ACF was abrogated when AMD treatment was performed at 4 °C (Fig. 4C), suggesting that nuclear export of ACF is an active, energy-requiring process. Furthermore, the cytoplasmic accumulation of ACF was reversible upon restoring transcription, as revealed in studies where AMD-treated cells were incubated in an AMD-free medium at 37 °C for 3 h (Fig. 4C). In summary, these data indicate that nuclear accumulation of ACF is a transcription and energy-dependent process. ACF Shuttles between the Nucleus and Cytoplasm—To formally demonstrate nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling of ACF, we analyzed its migration between nuclei in a human-mouse heterokaryon assay (18Fan X.C. Steitz J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15293-15298Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 20Pinol-Roma S. Dreyfuss G. Nature. 1992; 355: 730-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). HeLa cells transfected with FLAG-ACF were fused to mouse NIH3T3 cells to produce heterokaryons. Three hours after fusion, ACF was localized by immunofluorescence microscopy within murine nuclei of a representative heterokaryon (Fig. 5, a–c), establishing shuttling as a mechanism to account for ACF migration from the human to the mouse nucleus. Human nuclei were distinguished from the mouse nuclei using Hoechst dye (18Fan X.C. Steitz J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15293-15298Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). These data demonstrate that ACF, like HuR (Fig. 5, d–f), shuttles between the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. Nuclear Transport of ACF Involves Interaction with a Member of the Transportin Family—Distinct shuttling/NLS/NES motifs are recognized by specific protein carriers. Proteins containing a classical NLS motif are bound by the importin α/β complex and directed to the nuclear pore complex (23Weis K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 185-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Motifs like M9 or KNS in hnRNPs proteins or the HNS motif in HuR interact with transportin family members transportin 1 and transportin 2, respectively (24Pollard V.W. Michael W.M. Nakielny S. Siomi M.C. Wang F. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1996; 86: 985-994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar, 25Michael W.M. Eder P.S. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3587-3598Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 26Gallouzi I.E. Steitz J.A. Science. 2001; 294: 1895-1901Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Our findings to this point suggest that ACF uses a novel NLS for nuclear import. Accordingly, we asked whether ACF could interact with the known carrier proteins, importin-α, transportin 1, and transportin 2. We first performed immunoprecipitation assays in which recombinant ACF was mixed with a panel of [35S]Met-labeled transport proteins. The results of co-immunoprecipitation assays revealed an interaction only with Trn2 (data not shown). To demonstrate a biologically relevant ACF-Trn2 interaction in whole-cell extracts we applied lysates from ACF-transfected COS-7 cells to GST-Trn2 glutathione beads and examined the retained material by Western blotting. This approach demonstrated ACF in the eluate from the GST-Trn2 beads (Fig. 6A, lane 6). No ACF was detected in the eluted fraction from the control GST beads (Fig. 6A, lane 5). Importantly, an ACF mutant lacking the ANS motif did not bind Trn2 (Fig. 6A, lane 7) and as expected, accumulated in the cytoplasm of transfected cells (see Fig. 3B). By way of a positive control, the binding of HuR to Trn2 was confirmed in this assay (Fig. 6A, lane 8). To further confirm the interaction between Trn2 and ACF, we transiently expressed epitope-tagged proteins in COS-7 cells and confirmed their nuclear colocalization (Fig. 6B). The merged images show an overlapping signal at the border of the nuclear envelope, suggesting the presence of ACF associated with Trn2, possibly at the nuclear pore complex. Clearly, however, further studies will be required to examine this possibility in detail. Nevertheless, these data allowed us to examine the hypothesis that transport of ACF requires a physical interaction between the ANS motif and the Trn2 carrier. Accordingly, FLAG-tagged fusion proteins were prepared using wild-type and Δ-ACF mutants and a FLAG-ANS chimera (Fig. 7, A and B). Transportin 2 was expressed in vitro as a 35S-radiolabeled protein and mixed with the indicated unlabeled protein in an immunoprecipitation pull-down experiment to examine the physical interaction between the ANS and Trn2 (Fig. 7C). The data reveal a strong interaction with both wild-type ACF and with the FLAG-ANS recombinants but not with the Δ-ANS mutant of ACF (Fig. 7C). We interpret these findings as evidence of a physical interaction between Trn2 and the ANS domain of ACF. In this study we have characterized a novel 41-residue motif in ACF that functions as an authentic NLS in directing ACF as well as heterologous proteins to the nucleus. In addition, we demonstrate that the transport of ACF into and out of the nucleus is an energy-dependent process that requires active transcription. We demonstrate that ACF shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm and that this shuttling likely involves at least two candidate transport proteins, transportin 2 and CRM1. ApoB mRNA editing is almost certainly a nuclear event. Evidence from earlier in vivo studies using rat liver (27Lau P.P. Xiong W.J. Zhu H.J. Chen S.H. Chan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20550-20554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as more recent approaches using reconstituted cell-based assays with splicing-competent or -defective reporter constructs have demonstrated that C to U editing occurs on a spliced but intranuclear transcript (28Sowden M.P. Smith H.C. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 697-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). These features are consistent with the nuclear staining reported for epitope-tagged ACF (4Blanc V. Henderson J.O. Kennedy S. Davidson N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46386-46393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 7Blanc V. Navaratnam N. Henderson J.O. Anant S. Kennedy S. Jarmuz A. Scott J. Davidson N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10272-10283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and the finding that induction of apoB mRNA editing activity in vivo is associated with increased nuclear abundance of ACF (12Mukhopadhyay D. Plateroti M. Anant S. Nassir F. Samarut J. Davidson N.O. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 711-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The distribution of endogenous apobec-1, on the other hand, remains unknown since its expression is below the detection limits of currently available reagents (13Yang Y. Smith H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13075-13080Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This said, an unexplained paradox is that the distribution of apobec-1, as inferred from expression studies using epitope-tagged protein, has been reported to be predominantly cytoplasmic (4Blanc V. Henderson J.O. Kennedy S. Davidson N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46386-46393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 7Blanc V. Navaratnam N. Henderson J.O. Anant S.

A. 1997; 94: 13075-13080Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). It remains possible that the cytoplasmic distribution of apobec-1 after transient transfection may reflect saturation of the nuclear import machinery in COS cells, specifically ACF, and we will return to this possibility below. The current report identifies a novel motif (ANS) that directs nuclear localization of ACF itself as well as heterologous proteins, including GFP and β-galactosidase. This motif has no homology to other known NLSs, including the hnRNP-type elements found in known shuttling proteins and the NLS found in the third double-stranded RNA binding domain of the RNA-editing enzyme ADAR1 (29Eckmann C.R. Neunteufl A. Pfaffstetter L. Jantsch M.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1911-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Among the potentially informative features examined within this motif, the ANS contains a cluster of glycine residues, reminiscent of those in the M9 motif of hnRNP A1 (Fig. 1C). The importance of these residues emerged from studies in which mutation of a specific glycine (Gly-274) in the M9 motif disrupted the nuclear localization of hnRNP A1 (19Michael W.M. Choi M. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1995; 83: 415-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we mutated each glycine to an alanine residue and tested the localization of the ACF mutants in transiently transfected COS-7 cells. However, none of these mutations affected the nuclear distribution of ACF, 2V. Blanc, S. Kennedy, and N. O. Davidson, unpublished observations. suggesting that these residues alone do not confer targeting specificity to the ANS. Comparison of the putative NLS motifs of ACF orthologs indicates that the ANS is not conserved between Drosophila (accession number AAL13706), Caenorhabditis elegans (accession number F58D5.1), and human ACF (accession number AF 209192), suggesting that the ANS may have been acquired after the divergence of C. elegans and mammalian lineages. By contrast, the amino-terminal, SV-40-type putative NLS is highly conserved throughout evolution (30Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 922-924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Gorlich D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2721-2727Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). These findings suggest the ANS motif may have evolved in connection with other functions, including site-specific C to U deamination of apoB, which emerged relatively recently. Several lines of evidence suggest that the ANS directs nuclear localization and shuttling of ACF independent of binding to apoB RNA. First, the current studies were undertaken in COS and HeLa cells, neither of which express endogenous apoB (7Blanc V. Navaratnam N. Henderson J.O. Anant S. Kennedy S. Jarmuz A. Scott J. Davidson N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10272-10283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In this regard, it is important to emphasize that a nuclear distribution of ACF has been previously reported in both human HepG2 cells and in rat McA7777 cells, suggesting that nuclear distribution is not a function of either endogenous apoB RNA expression nor of mRNA editing (7Blanc V. Navaratnam N. Henderson J.O. Anant S. Kennedy S. Jarmuz A. Scott J. Davidson N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10272-10283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Secondly, the location of the ANS is within the auxiliary domain of ACF, distant from the major functional domains required for its complementation activity in vitro. Conversely, mutants of ACF that disrupt RNA binding, such as ΔRRM2 and Δ-(257–331), appear nuclear even though they lack the apoB mRNA binding domain (4Blanc V. Henderson J.O. Kennedy S. Davidson N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46386-46393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The current findings demonstrate that in addition to its nuclear localization, ACF continuously shuttles across the nuclear envelope. Upon AMD treatment, ACF redistributes to the cytoplasm in a time- and temperature-dependent manner. Co-treatment with AMD and LMB restores the nuclear localization of ACF, suggesting that nuclear export occurs via CRM1, the canonical LMB-sensitive pathway (32Kudo N. Matsumori N. Taoka H. Fujiwara D. Schreiner E.P. Wolff B. Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9112-9117Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar, 33Wolff B. Sanglier J.J. Wang Y. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 139-147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). The transport of proteins across the nuclear envelope occurs through nuclear pores and involves several soluble carriers, particularly transportins and other factors recently identified as key regulators of mRNA export (23Weis K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 185-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). CRM1 is a member of the importin-β family and a major RNA export receptor in eukaryotes (34Moore M.J. Rosbash M. Science. 2001; 294: 1841-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). CRM1 is responsible for the export of shuttling proteins containing a leucine-rich NES, with the most fully characterized being within human immunodeficiency virus 1, Rev (35Fischer U. Huber J. Boelens W.C. Mattaj I.W. Luhrmann R. Cell. 1995; 82: 475-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar). No such leucine-rich region or NES-like motif could be identified in the primary sequence of ACF, and thus, the domain responsible for CRM1 interaction remains to be identified. We considered the possibility that apobec-1 contains the interacting leucine-rich NES, although previous work by Yang and Smith (14Yang Y. Sowden M.P. Smith H.C. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 267: 153-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) demonstrates that apobec-1 failed to accumulate in the nucleus after LMB treatment. Although this possibility will require formal evaluation, our preliminary observations indicate that the nuclear accumulation of ACF observed upon AMD and LMB co-treatment is diminished when apobec-1 is co-expressed; both proteins demonstrated a predominantly cytoplasmic colocalization pattern. 2V. Blanc, S. Kennedy, and N. O. Davidson, unpublished observations. We interpret these preliminary observations to suggest that the interaction of apobec-1 with ACF renders the CRM1-interacting domain inaccessible. Under these conditions the cytoplasmic distribution of apobec-1 and ACF implies the existence of an alternative, CRM1-independent pathway for nuclear export, a possibility that will require more complete evaluation in future studies. A further question raised by our findings concerns the possibility that ACF and apobec-1 are coordinately directed for nuclear import. Bidirectional transport functions, for example, have been ascribed to shuttling motifs within hnRNP A1 and hnRNP K (19Michael W.M. Choi M. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1995; 83: 415-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 25Michael W.M. Eder P.S. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3587-3598Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The current findings suggest that the ANS motif is responsible for the nuclear targeting of ACF but leave open the possibility that this motif directs import of the ACF-apobec-1 core enzyme complex. Clearly, the relationship between the shuttling of free ACF versus ACF functionally contained within an apobec-1 core enzyme complex will require further study. However, our findings permit us to conclude that the shuttling of free ACF (Fig. 5) occurs through an LMB-sensitive, CRM1-dependent pathway (Fig. 4). The current findings also suggest that the ANS domain is responsible for an interaction with transportin 2 and further demonstrate that ACF colocalizes with Trn2 in the nucleus (Fig. 6). These findings raise the possibility that ACF may also exit the nucleus via a CRM1-independent mechanism. In this regard it bears emphasis that the interaction between the ANS of ACF and Trn2 in no way precludes the possibility that Trn2 is involved in the nuclear export of ACF. Precedent exists for diverse pathways of nuclear export of RNA-binding proteins, exemplified by findings with HuR (36Brennan C.M. Gallouzi I.E. Steitz J.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). HuR interacts with two nuclear phosphoproteins, pp32 and APRIL, that contain leucine-rich NES motifs and which shuttle via a CRM1-dependent pathway. In addition, HuR is exported to the cytoplasm via a motif referred to as HNS, that interacts with Trn2 and which may be involved in HuR nuclear import as well as its export (26Gallouzi I.E. Steitz J.A. Science. 2001; 294: 1895-1901Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Further work will be required to resolve the importance of Trn2 in the nucleocytoplasmic distribution of ACF and its relationship to the compartmentalization of the ACF-apobec-1 complex. Finally, the results of these studies bear directly on the physiological significance of directed nuclear import of apobec-1. Previous studies have established that forced transgenic overexpression of apobec-1 is associated with promiscuous C to U RNA editing, suggesting that mechanisms likely exist in vivo through which the expression or localization of this protein is constrained. These issues take on greater relevance in the context of findings that both apobec-1 and ACF are AU-rich RNA binding proteins with targets (at least for apobec-1) that extend beyond apoB (37Anant S. Davidson N.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1982-1992Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). These and other questions concerning the nucleocytoplasmic distribution of both ACF and the ACF-apobec-1 complex will be the focus of future reports. We acknowledge with gratitude the support and useful discussions with all members of the Davidson laboratory, particularly Soo-Jin Cho, Debnath Mukhopadhyay, Jeff Henderson, Libby Newberry, and Jennifer Ball as well as informative discussions with Drs.

https://openalex.org/W2004023134,"Through the analysis of the transient expression of the luciferase reporter gene in HeLa cells, an evaluation has been made of the transcriptional activity of oestrogens and of selective oestrogen receptor (ER) modulators (SERMs), mediated by the α and β isoforms of the ER, on the epidermal growth factor receptor gene promoter. Oestrogen-activated ERβ presents a lower transcriptional activity compared with ERα, probably due to structural differences in the AF-1 regions of the receptors. Also SERMs induce different responses depending on the receptor isoform bound. Indeed, the phyto-oestrogens, genistein and daidzein, act as weak agonists of the oestrogenic activity via ERα, but as full agonists when bound to ERβ. The synthetic SERM 4OH-tamoxifen, on the other hand, displays an opposite behaviour since it exerts a full agonist action through ERα, but acts as a full antagonist via ERβ. As we have previously shown for ERα, an ERβ/Sp1 functional synergism has also been highlighted, by means of gel mobility shift assays. Moreover, our results show that the sensitivity of target tissues to oestrogens and SERMs can be affected by coexpression of ERs, depending on the formation of appropriate levels of homo- and heterodimers, thus providing a useful approach to predict the effects of hormonal treatment."

However, the function of merlin in neuronal cells has not been characterized. The cyclic AMP-PKA pathway elicits a wide array of metabolic and functional processes including cell growth and division, actin cytoskeleton rearrangements, and gene transcription. Stimulation of adenylate cyclase catalyzes the conversion of cytoplasmic ATP to cAMP. Cyclic AMP exerts its effects through the activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinases. In its inactive form cAMP-dependent protein kinase, PKA, is a tetramer that consists of two regulatory and two catalytic subunits. There are three catalytic subunit isoforms (Cα, Cβ, and Cγ) and four regulatory subunit isoforms (RIα, RIβ, RIIα, and RIIβ), the expression of which varies among cell types and tissues (16Skalhegg B.S. Taskén K. Front. Biosci. 2000; 5: D678-D693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cyclic AMP activates PKA by binding to its regulatory subunits, which disassociates the tetrameric complex and the catalytic subunits become free to phosphorylate substrate proteins. The specificity of PKA signaling is achieved by: 1) isoform multiplicity of the tetrameric complex; 2) the expression pattern of various subunits; and 3) compartmentalization of PKA at different subcellular locations through interaction with AKAPs. AKAPs bind PKA via the regulatory subunit of PKA and direct the kinase activity toward specific substrates at distinct intracellular locations. By binding additional signaling molecules, protein kinase A anchoring proteins (AKAPs) may also coordinate multiple signal transduction pathways (17Edwards A.S. Scott J.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 18Colledge M. Scott J.D.

In conclusion, Western blot analysis demonstrated widespread expression of merlin, ezrin, and RIβ in mouse and rat (Fig. 1) as well as human (not shown) central nervous system, as all analyzed regions (cerebrum, cerebellum, medulla, and pons) were positive. Immunohistochemical staining of human brain sections indicated expression of RIβ and merlin predominantly in cells morphologically identified as neurons. This is exemplified by sections from hippocampus and thalamus. In contrast, ezrin staining was predominantly seen in astrocytes (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Immunohistochemical staining of RIβ, merlin, and ezrin in human hippocampus (A–E) and thalamus (F–J). RIβ (A and F) and merlin (B and G) were detected in neurons, whereas ezrin (C and H) was predominant in glial cells. RIβ was detected with the PKA-RIβ antiserum, merlin with the 1398NF2 rabbit antiserum, and ezrin with the 3C12 mAb. Preimmune serum (D and I) and X63 (E and J) were used as controls, and did not show specific reactivity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Localization of Merlin and RIβ in Rat Hippocampal Cells—In cultured rat hippocampal cells merlin was detected predominantly in neurons where it colocalized with RIβ (Fig. 3C). Merlin and RIβ were colocalized in the cell body and partially along extensions in a punctate pattern. Double staining with the dendritic marker MAP2 indicated the presence of merlin in dendrites but also in axons, because some of the extensions positive for merlin were not positive for MAP2 (Fig. 3F). Weak merlin staining was also seen in astrocytes (Fig. 3G), where it colocalized with ezrin in the cell body and along the extensions. Delicate peripheral astrocyte processes stained strongly for ezrin but not merlin (Fig. 3I). Coprecipitation of Merlin with RIβ from Rat Brain by cAMP-Agarose Columns and Coimmunoprecipitation of Merlin and RIβ—The potential merlin-RIβ interaction was studied with two types of coprecipitation experiments. Both merlin and RIβ were shown to be present in the cytoskeletal fraction of rat brain lysate (Fig. 4, A and B). RIβ could be precipitated from rat brain lysate by cAMP-agarose beads as expected. Merlin coprecipitated with the cAMP-agarose·RIβ complex but not with control agarose beads (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, immunoprecipitation of RIβ coprecipitated merlin, and in a reciprocal experiment, RIβ was coprecipitated together with merlin. Again, neither merlin nor RIβ precipitated with control beads (Fig. 4B). Analysis of the Interaction of Transfected Merlin and RIβ-GFP—The localization and interaction between merlin and RIβ was further studied by transfection experiments. In COS7 cells, transfected merlin and RIβ-GFP colocalized in regions under the cell membrane (Fig. 5). In RIβ-GFP-transfected cells perinuclear protein aggregates were also seen (Fig. 5B). Merlin immunoreactivity was seen in some of the aggregates (Fig. 5C), a localization not seen in cells transfected with merlin only (not shown). The interaction was further studied by coimmunoprecipitation of transfected proteins. When COS7 cells, which express endogenous ezrin, were transfected with merlin and RIβ-GFP, merlin could be precipitated with the RIβ antibody and, as previously shown (7Grönholm M. Sainio M. Zhao F. Heiska L. Vaheri A. Carpén O. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 895-904PubMed Google Scholar), with the ezrin antibody (Fig. 6A). If COS7 cells were transfected with RIβ-GFP alone, ezrin was not coprecipitated with the RIβ antibody (Fig. 6B). These results indicate that merlin and RIβ are present in the same complex in transfected COS7 cells. In addition, ezrin can form a complex with merlin but not with RIβ. Merlin has been demonstrated to exist in three differentially phosphorylated forms with different mobility in SDS-PAGE (34Kissil J.L. Johnson K.C. Eckman M.S. Jacks T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10394-10399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). These forms (hypophosphorylated, phosphorylated, and hyperphosphorylated) can be identified in transfected 293 HEK cells. In subconfluent cells lysed in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors all three forms are present. When cells are grown to confluency the hypophosphorylated form becomes the most prominent (Fig. 6C). Coimmunoprecipitation experiments indicated that RIβ-GFP is specifically associated with the hypophosphorylated form of merlin. The amount of coprecipitated merlin was increased in confluent cells, in which the amount of the hypophosphorylated form was highest. Reciprocal experiments further verified the specific interaction between the proteins (Fig. 6C, bottom panel). Mapping of the RIβ Interaction Site in Merlin—The interaction site in merlin was mapped using three methods. Various merlin deletion constructs were expressed as GST fusion proteins and used as an affinity matrix to precipitate recombinant human RIβ. Merlin constructs containing residues 252–595 or 1–547 were able to precipitate RIβ, whereas GST or an irrelevant AKAP, GST-AKAP149, did not precipitate RIβ (Fig. 7). This indicates a direct interaction between merlin and RIβ, and suggests that the interaction domain resides within the α-helical part of merlin. The interaction was further studied with yeast two-hybrid experiments using RIβ, RIIβ, merlin, and ezrin constructs. The results demonstrated an interaction between RIβ and merlin but not between RIβ and ezrin. The interaction was mapped to the α–helical part of merlin (Fig. 8). The S518D mutation mimicking the phosphorylated Ser-518 or the S518A mutation did not bind RIβ. Proline substitution within the potential PKA binding site, A468P, fully abolished the interaction and another substitution, L472P, reduced binding to RIβ (Fig. 8). These constructs were, however, still active in other interaction assays (interaction tested with merlin 1–595 (wt), merlin 1–339, and ezrin 1–309, data not shown) (7Grönholm M. Sainio M. Zhao F. Heiska L. Vaheri A. Carpén O. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 895-904PubMed Google Scholar). Full-length merlin did not bind RIβ and RIIβ did not interact with any of the merlin or ezrin constructs.Fig. 8Mapping of the PKA-RIβ interaction domain in merlin by yeast two-hybrid mating experiment. Yeast cells expressing the indicated merlin and ezrin constructs as baits and RIβ or RIIβ as preys were mated and grown on color selection plates that discriminate for yeast expressing both bait and prey constructs. Blue is an indication of an interaction. Merlin wt 1–595, 1–595/S518A, 1–595/S518D, 1–339, or 492–595 do not bind RIβ. Merlin constructs containing the α-helical domain, merlin 1–546 and 252–595 can bind RIβ. Mutations A468P and L472P in merlin 252–595 inhibit binding to RIβ. Ezrin constructs ezrin wt 1–585, 1–309, and 278–585 do not bind RIβ and RIIβ does not bind merlin or ezrin constructs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The interaction site in merlin was further refined by an overlapping 20-mer peptide spot array encompassing part of the α-helical region of merlin. Recombinant radiolabeled RI bound to three overlapping peptides and thereby identified a 14-residue sequence critical for the interaction (Fig. 9). The regulatory subunit binding regions in AKAPs consist of several conserved residues (28Newlon M.G. Roy M. Morikis D. Carr D.W. Westphal R. Scott J.D. Jennings P.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1651-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The binding domain in merlin was aligned with 16 known AKAPs (Fig. 10). This alignment shows that the sequence between amino acids 463 and 480 of merlin contains several of the residues conserved in the R subunit binding domain of AKAPs. The amino-terminal part of the conserved region contains the interaction site identified by proline substitutions and peptide array. Comparison between merlin and D-AKAP1, another protein known to bind type I regulatory subunit, identified an additional six identical or conserved amino acids, which may be associated with the specificity of the interaction between these AKAPs and the regulatory subunits. Merlin was originally identified as a tumor suppressor involved in development of neurofibromatosis 2-related tumors, schwannomas and meningiomas. Several reports have analyzed the tumor suppressor activity, but so far little is known of the potential of merlin for additional functions. On the other hand, an indispensable role in early development (29McClatchey A.I. Saotome I. Ramesh V. Gusella J.F. Jacks T. Gene Dev. 1997; 11: 1253-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and rather wide tissue expression pattern suggest yet unidentified functions for merlin. Of special interest is the central nervous system, in which high expression levels have been detected during and after organogenesis (11Claudio J.O. Lutchman M. Rouleau G.A. Neuroreport. 1995; 6: 1942-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 13Stemmer-Rachamimov A.O. Gonzalez-Agosti C. Xu L. Burwick J.A. Beauchamp R. Pinney D. Louis D.N. Ramesh V. J. Neuropath. Exp. Neurol. 1997; 56: 735-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that merlin is an interaction partner for the RIβ regulatory subunit of PKA, a protein involved in neuronal signaling and synaptic plasticity. The interaction between merlin and RIβ could be demonstrated by several means. Coprecipitation experiments indicated that merlin and RIβ are in the same complex in rat brain homogenates and in transfected cells. In addition, in vitro studies using purified proteins, yeast two-hybrid analysis, and peptide blot overlay studies showed that the interaction is direct. Finally, immunolocalization studies of tissue sections, cultured hippocampal cells, and transfected cells demonstrated that merlin and RIβ are expressed in the same cell types and that their subcellular distribution is overlapping. The interaction domain in merlin was localized within the α-helical part of the protein, in which no interactions have been reported so far. ERM proteins and merlin are regulated by an intramolecular interaction between the amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains, which results in masking of some protein interaction sites (7Grönholm M. Sainio M. Zhao F. Heiska L. Vaheri A. Carpén O. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 895-904PubMed Google Scholar, 8Gonzalez-Agosti C. Wiederhold T. Herndon M.E. Gusella J. Ramesh V. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18452-18458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). RIβ does not interact with full-length merlin in in vitro binding assays, but interacts with truncated proteins that mimic the open conformation of the protein, suggesting that the interaction is subject to conformational regulation. Recently, p21 activated kinase PAK was identified as a molecule that can activate merlin by phosphorylating a carboxyl-terminal Ser-518 (33Xiao G.H. Beeser A. Chernoff J. Testa J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 883-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 34Kissil J.L. Johnson K.C. Eckman M.S. Jacks T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10394-10399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Merlin S518D did not bind RIβ in the yeast two-hybrid experiment, which could indicate that additional forms of activation are needed for this interaction to take place in vivo. Of the three phosphorylated forms of merlin the hypophosphorylated form was associated with RIβ in coimmunoprecipitation experiments. This is the first report of a merlin interacting protein where the phosphorylated state of merlin is important for the interaction. The amount of hypophosphorylated merlin is increased in confluent cells, whereas the hyperphosphorylated merlin is increased after PAK phosphorylation on serine 518. Interestingly, a cross-talk between PKA and PAK has been demonstrated in some cell types and this cross-talk regulates mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling and cytoskeletal integrity. It will be important to further characterize the role of merlin in coordination of the two signaling pathways. AKAPs function as multivalent scaffolds that assemble and integrate signals from multiple pathways. An AKAP should contain a sequence motif for binding regulatory subunits, an amphipathic helix with hydrophobic residues aligned along one face of the helix and charged residues along the other (28Newlon M.G. Roy M. Morikis D. Carr D.W. Westphal R. Scott J.D. Jennings P.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1651-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 35Carr D.W. Stofko-Hahn R.E. Fraser I.D. Bishop S.M.

Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 222-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Comparison with known AKAPs identified a sequence between residues 463 and 480 of the α-helical domain of merlin as a region, which shares most of the functionally relevant hydrophobic residues. Peptide binding experiments indicated a 14-residue sequence, which contains the amino-terminal part of this homologous region, as sufficient for the interaction. Proline substitution of a conserved residue in this region (Ala-468) abolished the interaction, and substitution of another conserved residue (Leu-472) in the vicinity inhibited binding to RIβ, further demonstrating the importance of this α-helical sequence in the interaction. The ERM protein ezrin has previously been shown to bind another regulatory subunit of PKA, RIIα. A signaling complex of ezrin, PKA, and PDZ-containing scaffolding proteins is thought to regulate the activity of ion transporters, indicating that ezrin is also a multivalent scaffold (37Sun F.

The RIIα-binding region in ezrin was suggested to be a non-canonical 14-amino acid amphipathic α-helical within amino acids 373–439, although no further deletion/mutation analysis of the binding domain has been reported (40Dransfield D.T. Bradford A.J. Smith J. Martin M. Roy C. Mangeat P.H. Goldenring J.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The present sequence alignment shows that residues 413–430 of ezrin would best fulfill the criteria of a regulatory binding interphase. Interestingly, the present results show that ezrin does not interact with RIβ and merlin does not bind to RIIα (data not shown). Thus, the structurally related proteins with many common interaction partners demonstrate selectivity in their interactions with PKA subunits. Although the functional significance of the merlin-RIβ interaction is not clear, interesting possibilities exist. Hippocampal long term depression and potentiation are defective in mice carrying a targeted disruption of the gene encoding for RIβ implicating a function for RIβ in hippocampal plasticity (21Huang Y.Y.

In contrast to other PKA regulatory subunits expressed in the central nervous system, the RIβ gene has a characteristic pattern of expression (41Cadd G. McKnight G.S. Neuron. 1989; 3: 71-79Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and despite a compensatory increase in total PKA activity, the RIβ –/– mice have impaired hippocampal function suggesting a unique role for the RIβ subunit (42Amieux P.S. Cummings D.E. Motamed K. Brandon E.P. Wailes L.A. Le K. Idzerda R.L. McKnight G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3993-3998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The RIβ subunit may be involved in modulating the responsiveness of cells to a cAMP-mediated signal because PKA holoenzymes containing RIβ are activated at lower concentrations of cAMP compared with a holoenzyme containing RIα (43Cadd G.G. Uhler M.D. McKnight G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19502-19506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As merlin and RIβ are expressed in the same cell types in the central nervous system, including the hippocampus, and form a complex there, one can speculate that merlin participates in neuronal PKA signaling. Further studies using animals with a targeted disruption of the NF2 gene are needed to further address this question. We thank V. Ramesh for the merlin 1C4 mAb and T. Halmesvaara and H. Ahola for skillful technical assistance."

Recent evidence suggests that Ets transcription factors may contribute to NOS2 induction by inflammatory stimuli. In this study, we investigated the role of Ets transcription factors in the regulation of NOS2 by LPS and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1. Transient transfection assays in macrophages showed that Ets-2 produced an increase in NOS2 promoter activity, whereas the induction by Ets-1 was modest and NERF2 had no effect. Elk-3 (Net/Erp/Sap-2a) markedly repressed NOS2 promoter activity in a dose-dependent fashion, and overexpression of Elk-3 blunted the induction of endogenous NOS2 message. Mutation of the Net inhibitory domain of Elk-3, but not the C-terminal-binding protein interaction domain, partially alleviated this repressive effect. We also found that deletion of the Ets domain of Elk-3 completely abolished its repressive effect on the NOS2 promoter. LPS administration to macrophages led to a dose-dependent decrease in endogenous Elk-3 mRNA levels, and this decrease in Elk-3 preceded the induction of NOS2 mRNA. In a mouse model of endotoxemia, the expression of Elk-3 in kidney, lung, and heart was significantly down-regulated after systemic administration of LPS, and this down-regulation also preceded NOS2 induction. Moreover, TGF-β1 significantly increased endogenous Elk-3 mRNA levels that had been down-regulated by LPS in macrophages. This increase in Elk-3 correlated with a TGF-β1-induced down-regulation of NOS2. Taken together, our data suggest that Elk-3 is a strong repressor of NOS2 promoter activity and mRNA levels and that endogenous expression of Elk-3 inversely correlates with NOS2. Thus, Elk-3 may serve as an important mediator of NOS2 gene expression.

Sepsis is a systemic inflammatory response to severe infection that frequently progresses to refractory hypotension, multiple organ system failure, and death (1Bone R.C. Ann. Intern. Med. 1991; 115: 457-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar). In a subset of patients, the release of bacterial cell wall-derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS 1The abbreviations used are: LPS, lipopolysaccharide; NO, nitric oxide; NOS, NO synthase(s); iNOS, inducible NOS; TGF-β1, transforming growth factor-β1; NID, Net inhibitory domain; CID, C-terminal-binding protein interaction domain; TCF, ternary complex factors; IFN, interferon. or endotoxin) initiates a cascade of inflammatory events (2Parrillo J.E. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 328: 1471-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1507) Google Scholar). This response to infection is mediated, in part, by macrophage activation and the release of proinflammatory cytokines (3Bone R.C. Grodzin C.J. Balk R.A. Chest. 1997; 112: 235-243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). Among the mediators induced by these signal cascades, nitric oxide (NO) acts as a key regulator of hypotension and end organ damage (4Rees D.D. Monkhouse J.E. Cambridge D. Moncada S. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 124: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 5Titheradge M.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 437-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). The production of nitric oxide from l-arginine is catalyzed by NO synthases (NOS) (6Stuehr D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 217-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar). Of the three isoforms of NOS identified in mammalian cells, the expression of NOS2 is inducible by many proinflammatory stimuli, such as interleukin-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, interferon-γ, and bacterial LPS, depending on the target cell. Thus, the study of NOS2 gene regulation is of particular importance in our understanding and management of sepsis and other inflammatory disorders. Ets proteins are a family of transcription factors that share a unique and highly conserved, winged helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain (7Wasylyk B. Hahn S.L. Giovane A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar, 8Dittmer J. Nordheim A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1377: F1-F11PubMed Google Scholar). Ets proteins are involved in the transcriptional regulation of genes important for determining tissue specificity, cellular differentiation, and cellular proliferation by binding to GGA(A/T) sites in the promoters/enhancers of these genes (7Wasylyk B. Hahn S.L. Giovane A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar, 8Dittmer J. Nordheim A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1377: F1-F11PubMed Google Scholar, 9Wasylyk B.

Biol. 1995; 15: 6961-6970Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Additional reports have also revealed that Ets family proteins regulate gene expression in non-immune cell types. For example, Dube et al. (12Dube A. Yasmin A. Sato T.N. Libermann T.A. Oettgen P. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 1177-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) showed that the Ets transcription factor NERF2 is an important mediator of the vascular-specific expression of TIE2 in endothelial cells. In addition, ESE-1 represents a novel mediator of vascular inflammation (13Rudders S. Gaspar J. Madore R. Voland C. Grall F. Patel A. Pellacani A. Perrella M.A. Libermann T.A. Oettgen P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3302-3309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a target gene of ESE-1 in vascular cells and macrophages is NOS2 (13Rudders S. Gaspar J. Madore R. Voland C. Grall F. Patel A. Pellacani A. Perrella M.A. Libermann T.A. Oettgen P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3302-3309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Due to the potential importance of Ets factors in immune cells and vascular inflammation, we wanted to determine whether other members of the Ets superfamily could regulate NOS2 gene expression. Beyond the induction of NOS2 by proinflammatory stimuli, previous work from our laboratory has focused on the role of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 in the down-regulation of NOS2 after its induction by proinflammatory cytokines and LPS (14Perrella M.A. Yoshizumi M.

TGF-β1 inhibited NOS2 at the level of gene transcription (14Perrella M.A. Yoshizumi M. Fen Z. Tsai J.-C. Hsieh C.-M. Kourembanas S. Lee M.-E. J. Biol.

However, we hypothesized that other mechanisms may exist for the inhibition of the NOS2 gene by TGF-β1. Among the Ets family members, a candidate gene known to have transcriptional repressive activity is Elk-3 (Net/Erp/Sap-2a) (18Giovane A. Pintzas A. Maira S.M. Sobieszczuk P. Wasylyk B. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1502-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 19Lopez M. Oettgen P. Akbarali Y. Dendorfer U. Libermann T.A. Mol. Cell.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5849-5865Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Elk-3 is a member of the ternary complex factors (TCF) subfamily of Ets proteins, along with Elk-1 and Sap-1. TCFs have been shown to participate in the response of the cell to Ras and growth signals. Important structural domains of TCFs include domains A (Ets domain that mediates DNA binding), B (interaction with serum-response factor), C (activation domain), and D (mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase docking domain) (22Maira S.M. Wurtz J.M. Wasylyk B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5849-5865Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 23Yang S.-H. Bumpass D.C. Perkins N.D. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5036-5046Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). When compared with Elk-1 and Sap-1, Elk-3 is unique in that it exhibits strong transcription repressor activity under basal conditions. Prior studies have shown that this inhibitory effect occurs through the Net inhibitory domain (NID) (22Maira S.M. Wurtz J.M. Wasylyk B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5849-5865Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and the C-terminal-binding protein interaction domain (CID) (24Criqui-Filipe P. Ducret C. Maira S.M. Wasylyk B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3392-3403Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The present study was designed to investigate the role of Ets transcription factors in the regulation of NOS2 by LPS and TGF-β1 in vitro and in vivo. Cell Culture and Reagents—Murine macrophages (RAW 264.7) were cultured as described previously (25Ejima K. Layne M.D. Carvajal I.M. Nanri H. Ith B. Yet S.-F. Perrella M.A. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2002; 4: 569-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and NIH/3T3 cells were cultured according to recommendations from American Type Culture Collection. LPS from Escherichia coli (serotype O26:B6) was purchased from Sigma, and human recombinant TGF-β1 and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and murine recombinant interferon (IFN)-γ were purchased from PeproTech Inc. (Rocky Hill, NJ). Plasmid Constructs and DNA Probes—The mouse NOS2 luciferase reporter plasmids, iNOS(–1485/+31), iNOS(–815/+31), iNOS(–518/+31), and iNOS(–234/+31) in the pGL2-Basic vector (Promega) were described previously (14Perrella M.A. Yoshizumi M.

Ets-1, Ets-2, NERF2, and Elk-3 (Erp)-cloned into pCI expression vector (Promega), and iNOS(–234/+31)ETSm with a mutation in the Ets binding site located at bp –190 to –180, were generous gifts from Dr. Peter Oettgen, Boston, MA. Elk-3ΔA (Elk-3 without the A domain, see Fig. 5B, upper panel) was generated by subcloning the PCR product, using primers: 5′-CATGCCATGGCCAGCCGCAACGAGTACC-3′ and 5′-ATAGTTTAGCGGCCGCTGTGGGGAACTGGAAAAGTGT-3′, into pCMV/myc/nuc expression vector (Invitrogen) at the NcoI and NotI sites. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis of Elk-3 was performed by a PCR method using Pfu Turbo polymerase (Stratagene) followed by DpnI digestion to remove unmutated plasmids. We altered the NID and the CID of Elk-3 to produce N1, N2, C1, C2, and C3 mutants (schematic structures as described in Fig. 5A, upper panel) as described previously (22Maira S.M. Wurtz J.M. Wasylyk B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5849-5865Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 24Criqui-Filipe P. Ducret C. Maira S.M. Wasylyk B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3392-3403Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). All constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Transient Transfections of RAW 264.7 Cells and Reporter Activity Assays—iNOS(–1485/+31), iNOS(–234/+31), and iNOS(–234/+31)ETSm reporter constructs were used for transient transfection assays. For assays in RAW 264.7 cells, 4 × 105 cells/well were plated in duplicate on 6-well plates and incubated overnight. Using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science), cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of a NOS2 reporter plasmid plus the indicated amounts of expression constructs, Ets-1, Ets-2, NERF2, Elk-3 (wild or mutated type). The total amount of plasmid DNA was kept constant among groups by normalizing with empty pCI vector. Twenty-four h later, LPS (10 ng/ml) was given to the indicated wells. The cells, incubated with or without LPS for 24 h, were harvested for assessment of luciferase activity using Promega's luciferase assay system. As described previously (13Rudders S. Gaspar J. Madore R. Voland C. Grall F. Patel A. Pellacani A. Perrella M.A. Libermann T.A. Oettgen P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3302-3309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), we omitted co-transfection of a second plasmid for determination of transfection efficiency because many commonly used viral promoters contain binding sites for Ets factors, thus leading to potential artifacts when used in conjunction with Ets expression plasmids. At least 2–3 independent experiments, carried out in duplicate, were performed for each experimental condition. Transient Transfections of NIH/3T3 cells—pCI or Elk-3 (6 μg of each) were transfected into NIH/3T3 cells (100-mm dishes) using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent, according to the manufacturer's instructions. After overnight incubation, LPS (2 μg/ml), IL-1β (10 ng/ml), and IFN-γ (100 units/ml) were added to NIH/3T3 cells. Fibroblasts, similar to smooth muscle cells (15Perrella M.A. Patterson C. Tan L.

Chem. 1996; 271: 13776-13780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), are not as sensitive to LPS stimulation alone as are macrophages and therefore require the addition of proinflammatory cytokines for NOS2 induction. After 24 h of treatment, RNA was harvested for Northern blot analysis. Mouse Model of Endotoxemia—Wild-type male C57BL/6 mice were injected intraperitoneally with LPS (10 mg/kg) or vehicle (saline). Heart, kidney, and lung tissues were harvested from the mice 4 and 12 h after LPS/vehicle was administrated. All endotoxemia experiments in mice were performed in accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines and approved by the Harvard Medical Area Standing Committee on animals. RNA Isolation and Northern Blot Analysis—RNeasy Mini RNA isolation kit (Qiagen) was used to extract total RNA from cultured cells and mouse tissues. Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously (26Chen Y.-H. Layne M.D. Watanabe M. Yet S.-F. Perrella M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47658-47663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The signal intensity was measured on a Phosphor-Imager using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Statistics—Where indicated, comparisons between groups were made by factorial analysis of variance followed by Fisher's least significant difference test. Elk-3 Represses NOS2 Promoter Activity—To explore the role of Ets factors in transcriptional regulation of the NOS2 promoter in macrophages, we transfected RAW 264.7 cells with expression constructs for several Ets proteins (including Ets-1, Ets-2, NERF2, and Elk-3) and assessed promoter activity of the iNOS(–1485/+31) reporter construct. Using transient transfection assays in the absence of LPS, we found that Ets-2 stimulated NOS2 promoter activity (∼3-fold induction, p < 0.05), whereas the Ets-1 induction was modest (<2-fold, not significant) and NERF2 had no effect (Fig. 1). After 24 h of treatment with LPS, NOS2 promoter activity with control empty plasmid (pCI) was induced ∼7-fold, and the addition of Ets-2 with LPS produced a 16-fold induction (p < 0.05). In the presence of LPS, Ets-1 induced NOS2 promoter activity 12-fold, although this was not significantly different from NOS2 promoter activity transfected with control plasmid (7-fold). NERF2 had no additional effect on NOS2 promoter activity, even in the presence of LPS. Elk-3, in contrast, showed a strong repressive effect (80–85% at a concentration of 200 ng/well, p < 0.05) on the promoter activity of iNOS(–1485/+31), in the presence or absence of LPS. Elk-3 Represses NOS2 Promoter Activity in a Dose-dependent Manner—We next wanted to determine whether the effect of Elk-3 on LPS-mediated NOS2 induction was contingent on Elk-3 plasmid concentration. As shown in Fig. 2, the repressive effect of Elk-3 on the NOS2 promoter in the presence of LPS was dose-dependent. At a concentration of 200 ng/well, Elk-3 repressed LPS-induced NOS2 promoter activity to a level not statistically different from baseline, and a >95% reduction occurred at an Elk-3 concentration of 800 ng/well. These data suggest that Elk-3 is a strong repressor of NOS2 promoter activity in macrophages and that Elk-3 at higher concentrations can completely abrogate the induction of NOS2 by LPS. Overexpression of Elk-3 Represses Endogenous NOS2 mRNA Levels—To determine whether overexpression of Elk-3 could regulate endogenous NOS2 expression, we performed transient transfection analyses of NIH/3T3 cells in the presence or absence of proinflammatory stimuli (LPS, IL-1β, and IFN-γ). NIH/3T3 cells were used because of their higher transfection efficiency when compared with RAW 264.7 cells. After transfection with the control empty plasmid (pCI) or Elk-3, we treated NIH/3T3 cells with LPS (2 μg/ml), IL-1β (10 ng/ml), and IFN-γ (100 units/ml) and then harvested total RNA after 24 h. Northern blot analysis revealed that when compared with control pCI plasmid, overexpression of Elk-3 repressed endogenous NOS2 mRNA that had been induced by LPS, IL-1β, and IFN-γ (Fig. 3). Ets Binding Site in the Downstream NOS2 Promoter (–190 to –180) Contributes to Ets-1 and Ets-2, but Not Elk-3, Alteration in NOS2 Promoter Activity—A critical Ets binding site in the downstream NOS2 promoter (bp –190 to –180) is important for the regulation of NOS2 promoter activity by the Ets transcription factor ESE-1 (13Rudders S. Gaspar J. Madore R. Voland C. Grall F. Patel A. Pellacani A. Perrella M.A. Libermann T.A. Oettgen P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3302-3309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To evaluate the function of this Ets binding site on Ets-1, Ets-2, and Elk-3 regulation of the NOS2 promoter, we performed deletion analysis and site-directed mutagenesis of the NOS2 promoter. Using several different NOS2 deletion constructs, iNOS(–1485/+31), iNOS(–815/+31), iNOS(–518/+31), and iNOS(–234/+31), we found that all of the constructs responded similarly to Ets-2 and Ets-1 induction, or Elk-3 repression, in RAW 264.7 cells (data not shown). However, mutation of the downstream Ets site (bp –190 to –180) in the iNOS(–234/+31) construct led to a significant blunting of LPS-induced NOS2 promoter activity by Ets-2 and Ets-1 (p < 0.05), when compared with wild-type promoter activity (Fig. 4). In contrast, mutation of this Ets site had no effect on the ability of Elk-3 to repress NOS2 promoter activity that was induced by LPS. NID and Ets Domains Are Important for Elk-3 Repression of NOS2 Promoter—Previous studies (22Maira S.M. Wurtz J.M. Wasylyk B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5849-5865Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 24Criqui-Filipe P. Ducret C. Maira S.M. Wasylyk B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3392-3403Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) have shown that two important and unique inhibitory domains, NID and CID, contribute to the repressive effects of Elk-3 (Fig. 5A, upper panel). To study the role of these Elk-3 inhibitory domains on NOS2 promoter activity, we mutated the same sites of NID and CID as described previously (22Maira S.M. Wurtz J.M. Wasylyk B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5849-5865Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 24Criqui-Filipe P. Ducret C. Maira S.M. Wasylyk B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3392-3403Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) to generate N1, N2, C1, C2, and C3 mutants (Fig. 5A, upper panel). As shown in Fig. 5A, in the lower panel, whereas various mutations of CID (C1, C2, and C3) had no effect on NOS2 promoter repression by Elk-3, the N2 mutant of NID had a reduced inhibitory effect as compared with wild-type Elk-3 (p < 0.05). Even more impressively, deletion of the Ets (A) domain of Elk-3 (Fig. 5B, upper panel) abolished its inhibitory effect on NOS2 promoter activity (Fig. 5B, lower panel). Elk-3 Is Down-regulated by LPS in Cultured Macrophages and Mouse Tissues—To investigate the endogenous regulation of Elk-3 expression in the presence of LPS, we harvested total RNA from RAW 264.7 cells that were treated with increasing doses of LPS (from 0 to 100 ng/ml) for 6 h. By Northern blot analysis, we found that mRNA levels of Elk-3 decreased in a dose-dependent fashion as the LPS dose increased (Fig. 6A). Data from mRNA levels of three independent experiments showed that LPS significantly decreased Elk-3 mRNA levels after 6 h at a dose of 1 ng/ml (p < 0.05), and the expression of NOS2 mRNA began to increase at this same dose (Fig. 6B, p < 0.05). Maximal suppression of Elk-3 mRNA (94% decrease) occurred at an LPS dose of 100 ng/ml, whereas NOS2 mRNA was dramatically induced. Furthermore, we investigated the relationship between Elk-3 and NOS2 expression in mice during endotoxemia. Northern blot analysis showed that the expression of Elk-3 was strongly repressed in mouse kidney, lung, and heart tissues 4 h after the administration of LPS, whereas NOS2 was induced (Fig. 7). By 12 h after LPS administration, the mRNA levels of Elk-3 increased and the mRNA levels of NOS2 decreased, reverting back toward their respective baseline levels. Taken together, these data demonstrate that endogenous expression of Elk-3 inversely correlates with NOS2 expression after treatment with LPS.Fig. 7Expression of Elk-3 inversely correlates with NOS2 mRNA in tissues from mice with endotoxemia. Male C57BL/6 mice were injected intraperitoneally with LPS (10 mg/kg) or vehicle (saline). The mice were killed at 4 or 12 h after vehicle or LPS administration, and total RNA was extracted from kidney, lung, and heart tissues. Northern blot analysis was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures,” using 32P-labeled Elk-3, NOS2, and 18 S rRNA probes. This experiment was performed two independent times.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) TGF-β1 Reverses the Suppression of Elk-3 by LPS and Decreases NOS2 Expression—We have reported previously that TGF-β1 significantly down-regulates NOS2 promoter activity and mRNA levels that had been induced by proinflammatory cytokines or LPS in vascular smooth muscle cells and macrophages, respectively (14Perrella M.A. Yoshizumi M. Fen Z. Tsai J.-C. Hsieh C.-M. Kourembanas S. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14595-14600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Perrella M.A. Patterson C. Tan L. Yet S.-F. Hsieh C.-M.

Reeves R. Perrella M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1653-1659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Since endogenous Elk-3 expression inversely correlates with NOS2 message, and overexpression of Elk-3 represses the induction of NOS2 by an inflammatory stimulus, we wanted to determine whether TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml) would increase Elk-3 mRNA that had been down-regulated by LPS (10 ng/ml). Total RNA was harvested from RAW 264.7 cells at various time points after LPS administration, as shown in Fig. 8. Northern blot analysis revealed that after LPS administration, Elk-3 mRNA levels decreased rapidly (as early as 1 h, data not shown), with a maximal suppression by 6 h (Fig. 8). Moreover, this decrease in Elk-3 mRNA by LPS preceded the induction of NOS2. TGF-β1 significantly increased Elk-3 mRNA levels that had been down-regulated by LPS, and this increase in Elk-3 correlated with a TGF-β1-induced down-regulation of NOS2. Since overexpression of Elk-3 can down-regulate LPS-induced NOS2 (Figs. 1, 2, 3), these data suggest that TGF-β1 may down-regulate NOS2, in part, by up-regulating Elk-3. The inflammatory response is a key component of host defense, but excessive activation of the immune system and subsequent release of vasoactive mediators, as occurs in endotoxemia and sepsis, may be fatal (3Bone R.C. Grodzin C.J. Balk R.A. Chest. 1997; 112: 235-243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). Overproduction of NO, through LPS and proinflammatory cytokine activation of NOS2, acts as a key regulator of hypotension and end organ damage (4Rees D.D. Monkhouse J.E. Cambridge D. Moncada S. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 124: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 5Titheradge M.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 437-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Due to the detrimental consequences of an exaggerated response to infection, the immune system must be tightly controlled to prevent a massive systemic reaction leading to multiple organ failure and death. The effects of proinflammatory cytokines can be counterbalanced by the production of anti-inflammatory mediators (3Bone R.C. Grodzin C.J. Balk R.A. Chest. 1997; 112: 235-243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). Thus, understanding the endogenous mediators responsible for the transcriptional regulation of NOS2 (either up-regulation or down-regulation) may provide important insight into the pathophysiology of systemic inflammatory processes such as endotoxemia and sepsis. In collaboration with Rudders et al (13Rudders S. Gaspar J. Madore R. Voland C. Grall F. Patel A. Pellacani A. Perrella M.A. Libermann T.A. Oettgen P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3302-3309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), we reported previously that ESE-1, a member of the immune modulatory family of Ets proteins, regulates NOS2 expression and is a mediator of vascular inflammation. In the present study, we extend these findings by investigating the role of additional Ets transcription factors in the regulation of NOS2 by LPS and TGF-β1. Transient transfection assays in macrophages showed that Ets-2, similar to ESE-1 (13Rudders S. Gaspar J. Madore R. Voland C. Grall F. Patel A. Pellacani A. Perrella M.A. Libermann T.A. Oettgen P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3302-3309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), increased NOS2 promoter activity. Induction of NOS2 by Ets-1 was modest, and NERF2 had no effect (Fig. 1). In contrast, Elk-3 markedly repressed NOS2 promoter activity (Figs. 1 and 2), and overexpression of Elk-3 blunted the induction of endogenous NOS2 by proinflammatory mediators (Fig. 3). Among the Ets family of proteins, Elk-3 is a member of the TCF subfamily, and it is known to have transcriptional repressive activity (18Giovane A. Pintzas A. Maira S.M. Sobieszczuk P. Wasylyk B. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1502-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 19Lopez M. Oettgen P. Akbarali Y. Dendorfer U. Libermann T.A. Mol. Cell.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5849-5865Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Two important inhibitory domains have been identified in the Elk-3 protein, NID (22Maira S.M. Wurtz J.M. Wasylyk B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5849-5865Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and CID (24Criqui-Filipe P. Ducret C. Maira S.M. Wasylyk B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3392-3403Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The NID, with a helix-loop-helix protein-protein interaction motif, produces its repressive effect by altering both DNA binding and gene transactivation (9Wasylyk B. Hagman J. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 213-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). On the other hand, CID interacts with a co-repressor, C-terminal-binding protein, to produce its repressive effect (24Criqui-Filipe P. Ducret C. Maira S.M. Wasylyk B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3392-3403Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In regard to NOS2 gene transactivation by an inflammatory stimulus, mutation of NID, but not CID, partially alleviated the repressive effect of Elk-3 (Fig. 5A). We also found that deletion of the Ets (A) domain of Elk-3 completely abolished its repressive effect on the NOS2 promoter (Fig. 5B). These data suggest that although NID contributes, the Ets domain is necessary for Elk-3 repression of NOS2 gene transactivation. TGF-β1 is a pleiotrophic growth factor involved in a broad spectrum of cellular activities, including the modulation of immune function (27Massague J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 597-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (3010) Google Scholar). Mice deficient in TGF-β1 exhibit widespread, uncontrolled inflammation and tissue necrosis, leading to death (28Shull M.M. Ormsby I. Kier A.B. Pawlowski S. Diebold R.J. Yin M. Allen R. Sidman C. Proetzel G. Calvin D. Annunziata N. Doetschman T.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 770-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar). These data suggest that TGF-β1 is an important anti-inflammatory mediator. Furthermore, TGF-β1 is known to decrease macrophage responsiveness to LPS (30Randow F. Syrbe U. Meisel C. Krausch D. Zuckermann H. Platzer C. Volk H.D. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1887-1892Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar) and to prevent NOS2 expression in response to proinflammatory cytokines (14Perrella M.A. Yoshizumi M. Fen Z. Tsai J.-C.

Pharmacol. 1992; 225: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that TGF-β1 inhibited NOS2 induction at the level of gene transcription (14Perrella M.A. Yoshizumi M. Fen Z. Tsai J.-C. Hsieh C.-M. Kourembanas S. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14595-14600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and this effect occurred in part by down-regulating the expression of the architectural transcription factor high mobility group (HMG)-I/Y protein (17Pellacani A. Wiesel P. Razavi S. Vasilj V. Feinberg M.W. Chin M.T. Reeves R. Perrella M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1653-1659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In addition, we demonstrated that the administration of TGF-β1 to rats inhibited NOS2 expression in vivo and that TGF-β1 arrested LPS-induced hypotension and decreased mortality (16Perrella M.A. Hsieh C.-M. Lee W.-S. Shieh S. Tsai J.-C. Patterson C. Lowenstein C.J. Long N.-C. Haber E. Shore S. Lee M.-E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2054-2059Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Since our current data revealed that during an LPS response, endogenous expression of Elk-3 inversely correlated with NOS2 expression (Figs. 6 and 7), we wanted to determine whether the anti-inflammatory mediator TGF-β1 would alter the expression of Elk-3 during an inflammatory stimulus such as LPS. In the present study, TGF-β1 significantly increased Elk-3 mRNA levels that had been down-regulated by LPS in macrophages. This increase in Elk-3 correlated with a TGF-β1-induced down-regulation of NOS2 (Fig. 8). Our data suggest that TGF-β1 induction of Elk-3 is another mechanism by which TGF-β1 may down-regulate NOS2 gene transcription after its induction by proinflammatory stimuli. The present study provides further insight into the regulation of the NOS2 gene by Ets factors. Ets-2 is able to increase NOS2 promoter activity; however, more impressively, Elk-3 is a potent repressor of NOS2 gene transactivation. Overexpression of Elk-3 can even suppress endogenous NOS2 that is induced by LPS and proinflammatory cytokines. The ability of Elk-3 to repress NOS2 depends on an inhibitory domain (NID, not CID) and the Ets domain of Elk-3. Moreover, endogenous Elk-3 mRNA is rapidly down-regulated by LPS, and this down-regulation precedes the induction of NOS2. Conversely, endogenous Elk-3 mRNA is induced by TGF-β1, and this induction is associated with a down-regulation of NOS2. Our data demonstrate that Elk-3 is a repressor of the NOS2 gene and that endogenous expression of Elk-3 inversely correlates with NOS2 expression. Thus, we propose that Elk-3 contributes to the tight control of NOS2 gene regulation in the setting of pro- and anti-inflammatory stimuli and that Elk-3 may serve as an important mediator of the NOS2 gene. We thank Dr. Peter Oettgen for generous gifts of NOS2 promoter construct iNOS(–234/+31)ETSm, Ets-1, Ets-2, NERF2, and Elk-3 (Erp) plasmids."
https://openalex.org/W1964422753,"Abstract Pyridoxal 5′-phosphate is an essential cofactor for many enzymes responsible for the metabolic conversions of amino acids. Two pathways for its de novo synthesis are known. The pathway utilized by Escherichia coli consists of six enzymatic steps catalyzed by six different enzymes. The fourth step is catalyzed by 4-hydroxythreonine-4-phosphate dehydrogenase (PdxA, E.C. 1.1.1.262), which converts 4-hydroxy-l-threonine phosphate (HTP) to 3-amino-2-oxopropyl phosphate. This divalent metal ion-dependent enzyme has a strict requirement for the phosphate ester form of the substrate HTP, but can utilize either NADP+ or NAD+ as redox cofactor. We report the crystal structure of E. coli PdxA and its complex with HTP and Zn2+. The protein forms tightly bound dimers. Each monomer has an α/β/α-fold and can be divided into two subdomains. The active site is located at the dimer interface, within a cleft between the two subdomains and involves residues from both monomers. A Zn2+ ion is bound within each active site, coordinated by three conserved histidine residues from both monomers. In addition two conserved amino acids, Asp247 and Asp267, play a role in maintaining integrity of the active site. The substrate is anchored to the enzyme by the interactions of its phospho group and by coordination of the amino and hydroxyl groups by the Zn2+ ion. PdxA is structurally similar to, but limited in sequence similarity with isocitrate dehydrogenase and isopropylmalate dehydrogenase. These structural similarities and the comparison with a NADP-bound isocitrate dehydrogenase suggest that the cofactor binding mode of PdxA is very similar to that of the other two enzymes and that PdxA catalyzes a stepwise oxidative decarboxylation of the substrate HTP."
https://openalex.org/W2069611040,"In Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the transcription factor Pap1, and the mitogen-activated protein kinase Sty1 are excluded from the nucleus in a Crm1-dependent manner under non-stressed conditions. Upon oxidant treatment, both Sty1 and Pap1 concentrate into the nucleus, due to an enhanced import or an impaired export. Hba1, a protein that when overexpressed confers brefeldin A resistance, contains a Ran binding domain. The purpose of this project was to understand at the molecular level the role of Hba1 in the S. pombe oxidative stress response. Fluorescent and confocal microscopy studies demonstrate that Hba1 is located at the nucleoplasm and not at the nuclear envelope. We also demonstrate that either multiple copies or deletion of the hba1 gene induces nuclear accumulation of Pap1 and Sty1. We propose that Hba1 assists Crm1 to export some nuclear export signal-containing proteins. Pap1 nuclear accumulation is sufficient for constitutive activation of its specific antioxidant response. On the contrary, constitutive nuclear localization of Sty1 in the Δhba1 strain does not trigger the Sty1-specific, Atf1-dependent antioxidant response in the absence of stress. We conclude that the increased multidrug resistance of strains lacking or overexpressing Hba1 is due to the accumulation of Pap1 in the nucleus under non-stressed conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2001287121,"Selenium has been shown to sustain the growth of selected human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines under serum-free conditions, but the detailed mechanism remained undetermined. In the present study, the molecular mechanism(s) involving sodium selenite (Na2SO3, Se) as a survival agent were determined. Selenite not only protects HuH7 cells from serum deprivation-induced apoptosis, it also supports its long-term growth in sodium selenite (10–7m) supplemented serum-free medium. The anti-apoptotic effect correlates with activation of focal adhesion kinase and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt kinase pathway. Using HuH7 cells stably transfected with a constitutively active Akt kinase and PI3K inhibitor LY294002, selenite-induced cell survival was shown to be PI3K-Akt-dependent. Parallel changes included a significant reduction in the intracellular reactive oxygen species content, the reversal of DNA fragmentation, and the suppression of caspase and apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 activities. HuH7 cells stably expressing a Rac1 mutant N17 (Rac1N17-HuH7) are refractory to selenite treatment. In these cells selenite supplement neither triggers Akt activation nor supports cell proliferation. Participation of Rac1 activation in this event is supported by the fact that selenite treatment drastically enhanced activation of Rac1. The exact link between selenite treatment, Rac1 activation, and activation of the focal adhesion kinase-PI 3-kinase, however, remains to be characterized. The mitogenic signaling mediated by selenite may involve unconventional growth stimuli including higher glutathione peroxidase 1 activity and higher transcription levels of selenoprotein P. The selenium-HuH7 system we have established thus provides a unique tool that will allow the biological role of selenite in growth regulation of hepatocytes to be studied in detail.

Extensive effort has been devoted to the study of the chemopreventive action of selenium in the recent years because cumulative evidence from both experimental and epidemiological approaches has linked low plasma levels of selenium with a high incidence of cancer in humans (13Schrauzer G.N.

Encouraging results from several large clinical trials demonstrated that selenium and certain selenium metabolites effectively reduced the overall cancer mortality rate and the incidence of all non-skin cancers including cancers of lung, colon-rectum, prostate, and liver (16Clark L.C.

Ther. 1998; 79: 179-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). Although the exact mechanism for its anti-carcinogenic activity still remains to be elucidated, it is widely accepted that multiple pathways are involved in this selenium-mediated chemoprevention (19Wu L. Lanfear J. Harrison P.R. Carcinogenesis. 1995; 16: 1579-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 20Fiala E.S. Staretz M.E. Pandya G.A. El-Bayoumy K. Hamilton S.R.

Res. 1997; 56: 117-124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Chronic liver diseases and primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are common diseases worldwide. HCC occurs in chronic liver disease associated with persistent infection by hepatitis B (HBV) or C virus in the majority of cases (21Bergsland E.K. Semin. Oncol. 2001; 28: 521-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Circumstantial evidence suggests that oxidative stress may play an indirect role in the genesis of HBV-induced HCC (22Hagen T.M. Huang S. Curnutte J. Fowler P. Martinez V. Wehr C.M. Ames B.N. Chisari F.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12808-12812Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Furthermore, supporting this is the fact that the only oncogenic gene product of HBV (HBx protein) is associated with mitochondria and can induce oxidative stress. This causes the subsequent activation of NF-κB and signal transducers and activators of transcription-3 and this is highly likely to be responsible for the oncogenicity of HBV (23Waris G. Huh K.-W. Siddiqui A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7721-7730Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). A study of the preventive role of selenium conducted by Yu et al. (17Yu S.Y. Zhu Y.J. Li W.G. Biol. Trace Elem. Res. 1997; 56: 117-124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) attributed its effect to immune modulation, but other molecular mechanisms may be involved in achieving such a treatment outcome. Inasmuch as great effort has been concentrated on the chemopreventive and/or chemotherapeutic effects of selenium, the fact that selenium also participates in cell signaling was not appreciated until recently. Selenium directly regulates the activity of many proteins crucial for various intracellular signaling pathways. The activities of NF-κB, AP-1 (24Kim I.Y. Stadtman T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12904-12907Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), JNK1 (25Park H.-S. Huh S.-H. Kim Y. Shim J. Kim I.Y. Choi E.-J. J. Biol.

Different lines of empirical evidence support a role for selenium in cell proliferation. Selenium, acting as an insulin-mimetic agent, indirectly stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation and activates mitogen-activated protein kinase (27Stapleton S.R. Garlock G.L. Foellmi-Adams L. Kletzien R.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1355: 259-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). As an essential component of clonal growth for the human fibroblasts and selected HCC cell lines (28McKeehan W.L. Hamilton W.G. Ham R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2023-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 29Barnes D. Sato G. Nature. 1979; 281: 388-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 30Murakami H. Masui H. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 3858-3863PubMed Google Scholar), selenium has been further implicated in survival/proliferation signaling. Therefore, a re-evaluation of selenium as a pleiotropic molecule is warranted. In the present study, we examined selenium-directed survival and growth signaling in a hepatocellular carcinoma cell line, HuH7. We demonstrate that selenium-mediated survival signaling consists of reduced oxidative stress, elevated GPX1 activity, activation of the FAK-PI3K-Akt pathway, and suppression of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) activity. Rac1 seems certain to play a role or roles in the upstream activation of the FAK-PI3K-Akt pathway. From this study, we also successfully established a HuH7 cell culture supported solely by sodium selenite, which will provide a unique model system for the study of the differential signaling involved in selenium “cell survival” and selenium “cell proliferation.” Cell Culture, Selenite Supplement, and Transfection—HuH7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mm l-glutamine, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. Where indicated, cells were changed to different types of media. These were serum-free medium (SF-DMEM), which is DMEM with FBS replaced with 0.1% bovine serum albumin and Se-DMEM, which is SF-DMEM containing 10–7m sodium selenite (Na2SeO3, Sigma). HuH7 cells cultured in the sodium selenite medium were designated as selenium long term (SeLT). HuH7 cells stably expressing a constitutively active mutant of Akt (Myr-Akt) or a dominant-negative mutant Rac1 (N17 Rac1) were generated by electroporation and appropriate drug selection using 250 μg/ml G418 selection. A clone with a high level of expression of Myr-Akt (Akt*-HuH7) and a clone expressing Rac1N17 (Rac1N17-HuH7) were selected for this study. The Myr-Akt construct was generously provided by Dr. A. Klipple (Chiron Inc., Emeryville, CA). Cell viability was determined by the trypan blue exclusion method. Wild type Rac1 (WT Rac1), N17 Rac1, and a constitutively active mutant L61Rac1 were used for transient transfection by the CaPO4 method. Antibodies and Reagents—Anti-phospho-specific polyclonal antibody to Akt (Ser473) was purchased from New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA). Phospho-specific polyclonal antibody to ERK1 (Thr183/Tyr185) was purchased from Promega. Phospho-specific antibody to FAK (Tyr397) was purchased from BIOSOURCE (Camarillo, CA). Anti-ASK1 polyclonal antibody (H-300), anti-Akt polyclonal antibody (C-20), and anti-FAK polyclonal antibody were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. Mouse monoclonal antibody to the hemagglutinin tag was purchased from BABCO (Richmond, CA). Monoclonal antibody to Rac1 was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Sodium selenite (Na2SO3), 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (DNCB), a specific inhibitor of thioredoxin reductase and other antioxidants including Tiron, a cell-permeable pharmacological scavenger of O2·¯ ; N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC), an antioxidant; and diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), an inhibitor of cellular plasma membrane NAD(P)H oxidase were purchased from Sigma. 2′,7′-Dichlorofluorescein diacetate was purchased from Molecular Probes Inc. (Eugene, OR). LY294002 was purchased from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Analysis of DNA Fragmentation—DNA fragmentation was analyzed by two electrophoretic methods. Cells (2 × 106) were exposed to the indicated treatment, harvested, and lysed using a lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris, 10 mm EDTA, 2% SDS, and 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K at 60 °C for 3 h. After treatment with DNase-free RNase at 50 °C for 1 h, DNA was extracted using the phenol-chloroform method and precipitated by sodium acetate. DNA was dissolved in TE (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA) and analyzed by electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. To detect higher molecular DNA fragments (>50 kb), pulse-field electrophoresis was used according to Li et al. (32Li T.-K. Chen A.Y. Yu C. Mao Y. Wang H. Liu L.F. Gene Dev. 1999; 13: 1553-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell lysis was carried out in situ in the plug by placing them in a tube containing TEN buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm EDTA, and 100 mm NaCl) with 1% SDS, and 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K (added fresh each time). Following incubation at 50 °C for 24 h, the integrity of nuclear DNA in the plugs was analyzed by pulse-field electrophoresis. Electrophoresis was performed in a Rotaphor Type V unit (Biometra, Kent, United Kingdom) in a cold room for 24 h at 200 V with switching range from 5 to 60 s. Following electrophoresis, the gel was stained with 1 mg/ml ethidium bromide and photographed. Assay of Intracellular Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)—Intracellular ROS production was measured according to the method of Oyama et al. (33Oyama Y. Hayashi A. Ueha T. Maekawa K. Brain Res. 1994; 635: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were treated, trypsinzed, then resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 μm 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate. Cells were incubated in the dark for 15 min at 37 °C. H2DCF-DA diffused into cells, where it is hydrolyzed to 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein. The fluorescence intensity of DCF formed by the reaction of 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein with H2O2 from each sample was analyzed by a flow cytometer (FACSort) with excitation and emission settings of 490 and 526 nm, respectively. The x axis (FSC-H) indicates the cell number and the y axis indicates fluorescent intensity. RNA Isolation and Real-time Quantitative PCR—Total RNA was purified from cultured cells using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). RNA was quantified at 260 nm by spectrophotometry. Complementary DNA (cDNA) was prepared from the total RNA of HuH7 cells with SuperScript RNase H-reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The expression of GPX1 and selenoprotein P were examined by real-time PCR using the forward and reverse primers, 5′-CCCTACGCAGGTACAGC-3′ and 5′-AGACTGGGATCAACAGGAC-3′. Expression of selenoprotein P was examined using the forward and reverse primers, 5′-GTTGAAACTCCATCGCCT-3′ and 5′-CTCGGTTCTCTGGGTG-3′. Real-time PCR was performed using a LightCycler rapid thermal cycler system (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reactions were performed in a 20-μl volume with an optimized cDNA concentration (1/100 dilution for glutathione peroxidase 1 and 1/1000 dilution for selenoprotein P). A standard LightCycler-DNA Master SYBR Green I mixture containing 3 mm MgCl2 (Roche Diagnostics) was used. The typical protocol was a 30-s denaturation step followed by 30 cycles with a 95 °C denaturation for 0 s, 60 °C annealing for 5 s, and 72 °C extension for 5 s. The quantification was carried out using the LightCycler analysis software (Roche Diagnostics). The relative levels of mRNA are expressed as a ratio of Cp to an internal control, the DAD1 gene. Assay of Cytosolic GPX1—The GPX1 activity was measured by a cellular glutathione peroxidase assay kit (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's methodology. Briefly, the cell lysate was added to a solution containing GSH, glutathione reductase, and NADPH. The reaction was initiated by the addition of the organic peroxide, tert-butyl hydroperoxide, and the A 340 was recorded. The rate of decrease in the A 340 was directly proportional to the GPX1 activity of the cell lysate. Western Blotting, Kinase Assays, and Protein Phosphorylation—Cells were lysed in a lysis buffer containing phosphatase and protease inhibitors (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and the protein concentration of each supernatant was determined by the Bradford protein assay. The kinase activities of Akt, ERK, and FAK were estimated using an immunoblotting approach involving phosphospecific antibodies to Akt (Ser347), ERK (Thr183/Tyr185), and FAK (Tyr397), respectively. The kinase activity of ASK1 was measured using an immunocomplex kinase assay. Fifty micrograms of cell lysate was incubated with 3 μgof ASK1 antibody at 4 °C overnight. The immunocomplexes were then coupled during incubation with protein G-agarose for an additional 2 h at 4 °C, after which they were pelleted by centrifugation. The immunocomplex was rinsed twice with the lysis buffer and then twice with the kinase buffer (KB: 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm MgCl2). Immunocomplex kinase assays were performed according to Saitoh et al. (34Saitoh M. Nishitoh H. Fujii M. Takeda K. Tobiume K. Sawada Y. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2596-2606Crossref PubMed Scopus (2083) Google Scholar), by incubating the immunopellets for 20 min at 30 °C with 3 μg of the substrate protein, myelin basic protein, in 15 μl of KB containing 100 μm ATP and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (2 μCi/μl, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The reaction was stopped by adding 7.5 ml of 3× sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol) and heating at 80 °C for 3 min. Phosphorylated substrates were visualized by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gel was dried and exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film and detected by autoradiography. The relative intensity of labeling was quantified using a Storm 840 phosphorimaging system (Amersham Biosciences). Measurement of Caspase-3 Activity—Cultured cells were lysed with a lysis buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 10 μg/m leupeptin. The supernatant of the cell lysate (100 μg of protein) was then assayed for caspase-3 activity using Ac-DEVD-AMC, a colorimetirc substrate for caspase-3, as described in the CaspACE assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI). The specificity of the caspase-3 was monitored using the CPP32 inhibitor Ac-DEVD-CHO and ICE inhibitor: Ac-YVAD-CHO. The amount of yellow-green fluorescence produced upon cleavage (the free AMC) was proportional to the amount of caspase-3 present in the cell extract. A CytoFluor™ 2300 fluorescence plate reader (Millipore) with an excitation wavelength of 360 nm and emission wavelength of 460 nm was used to record the fluorescence. Rac1 Activation Assay—Rac1 activation was measured using an affinity precipitation immunoblot protocol as employed by the Rac activation assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology). Briefly, cell lysate was prepared in Mg2+ lysis/wash buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Igepal CA-630, 10 mm MgCl2,1mm EDTA, 2% glycerol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. One ml of lysate was then incubated at 4 °C for 60 min with 5–10 μg of PAK-1-agarose to bind the Rac-GTP. The proteins bound to PAK-1 were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with Rac1 monoclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology). The positive and negative controls are lysates loaded with GTPγS or GDP, respectively. Selenite Protects HuH7 Cells from Serum Withdrawal-induced Apoptosis—Based on the report of Nakabayashi et al. (31Nakabayashi H. Taketa K. Miyano K. Yamane T. Sato J. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 3858-3863PubMed Google Scholar) that certain hepatoma cell lines were able to grow in a chemically defined synthetic medium containing selenite, the cell growth of HuH7 was tested in medium supplemented with sodium selenite at concentrations between 10–8 and 10–6m. HuH7 cells grew well over a 48-h period (Fig. 1A) as previously reported, with 10–7m being the optimal concentration. From that point onwards, DMEM containing 10–7m sodium selenite supplementation (Se-DMEM) was used throughout the study. HuH7 cells did not survive in SF-DMEM but grew in the Se-DMEM albeit with a slightly slower rate (doubling time 40–60 h versus 32–38 h, data not shown) and this resulted in a slightly lower saturation density compared with cells cultured in the complete medium (FBS-DMEM) (Fig. 1B). As shown in Fig. 1C, cell death induced by serum withdrawal was apparent in the 2-day culture (SF2) but was not observed in Se-supplemented cultures (Se2) or in cells cultured first with SF-DMEM for 1 day followed by Se-DMEM for 2 days (SF1Se2). It is likely that any sublethal damage that might have resulted from exposure to SF-DMEM over the first day was reversed in time by selenite. During the course of this study, a HuH7 cell culture solely supported by sodium selenite supplementation was established, which was designated as the selenium long term culture of HuH7 cells (SeLT). Morphologically, SeLT cells are smaller in size and assume a flat appearance (SeLT in Fig. 1C). The possibility that SeLT cells have differentiated as they adapted to the different growth conditions elicited by the selenium supplementation is not excluded. ROS generated during oxidative stress are known to cause a variety of cellular damage, including damage to DNA and protein, lipid peroxidation, and damage to a variety of proteins involved in signal transduction pathways. These may lead to apoptotic cell death. Because selenite is associated with antioxidant activity, several vital cellular parameters known to be affected by oxidative stress were examined, including the intracellular ROS content, DNA integrity, and the status of ASK1. HuH7 cells cultured under different conditions were harvested and incubated with the fluorophore H2DCF-DA and subsequently subjected to ROS analysis by flow cytometry. After 1 day in serum-free medium, HuH7 cells showed a significantly higher amount of ROS (Fig. 2A, SF1 versus FBS). Twelve hours of selenium supplementation effectively lowered the ROS content to its basal level (SF1Se12h versus FBS). The effects of several other antioxidants, including Tiron, a cell-permeable pharmacological scavenger of O2·¯ , DPI, an inhibitor of cellular plasma membrane NAD(P)H oxidase, and NAC, a membrane-permeant antioxidant were compared. As shown in Fig. 2, exposure to DPI eliminated almost all measurable H2O2 generation during serum withdrawal, but Tiron and NAC were less effective. The effectiveness of these compounds in reducing the intracellular concentration of ROS is in the following order: DPI > selenite > Tiron > NAC. Upon serum withdrawal, HuH7 cells manifested severe DNA fragmentation but with no distinct DNA ladder (Fig. 2B, left panel). Using pulse-field electrophoresis, it was clearly demonstrated that serum deprivation generated high molecular weight DNA fragments of 50–100 kb in size and that this was reduced by selenite treatment (SF1Se1 versus SF2) (Fig. 2B, right panel). This result is similar to the H2O2-induced high molecular weight DNA fragments reported by others (32Li T.-K. Chen A.Y. Yu C. Mao Y. Wang H. Liu L.F. Gene Dev. 1999; 13: 1553-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 35Wang H. Mao Y. Chen A.Y. Zhou N. LaVoie E.J. Liu L.F. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3316-3323Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence has indicated that apoptotic high molecular weight DNA fragmentation is produced when thiolation of the cysteine residues of topoisomerase II modifies the enzyme-DNA complex resulting in the activation of topoisomerase II-mediated excision of chromosomal DNA loops (32Li T.-K. Chen A.Y. Yu C. Mao Y. Wang H. Liu L.F. Gene Dev. 1999; 13: 1553-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 36Lagarkova M.A. Iarovaia O.V. Razin S.V. J. Biol.

Our data suggest that selenium supplementation appears to undo the chromosomal damage that originated from oxidative stress, possibly by reversing the oxidative status of the critical cysteine residues of topoisomerase II. Many lines of evidence suggested that ASK1 is activated during apoptotic cell death by high concentration of H2O2 and oxidation of thioredoxin (Trx) (34Saitoh M. Nishitoh H. Fujii M. Takeda K.

In vivo, the oxidized form of Trx (Trx-S2) is reduced to a dithiol by NADPH and thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), which is a selenoprotein (40Buchanan B.B. Schurmann P. Decottignies P. Lozano R.M. Arch.

In this study, the possibility of ASK1 participating in selenite-directed anti-apoptotic signaling was investigated. ASK1 activity was assayed by immunocomplex kinase assay with myelin basic protein as the substrate. HuH7 cells were serum-starved for 1 day before being supplemented with selenite for 1–24 h. As shown in Fig. 2C, endogenous ASK1 activity was induced by serum deprivation (SF1 and SF2) and was effectively suppressed upon addition of selenite. To demonstrate that ASK1 activity is modulated by the Trx-TrxR complex, the effect of a highly specific inhibitor of TrxR, DNCB was investigated (34Saitoh M. Nishitoh H. Fujii M. Takeda K. Tobiume K.

https://openalex.org/W2132195610,"The accumulation of oxidized proteins is one of the highlights of age-related changes of cellular metabolism and happens at least partially as a result of a decline in the activity of intracellular proteases (e.g., the proteasome). Because the proteasome is located in numerous cellular compartments, we tested whether and to which extent the proteasome and the protein turnover changes in the cytosolic compartment and in the nucleus of proliferating fibroblasts. We demonstrated that the activity of the proteasomal system declines during proliferative senescence of human fibroblasts in the cytosol dramatically, whereas it is stable within the nucleus. It could be demonstrated in both compartments that an accumulation of oxidized proteins occurs. After oxidative stress, a short timed activation of the proteasomal system in the nucleus occurs. This activation was accompanied by an increase in the protein turnover in response to oxidative stress, which was also present in the nucleus of senescent cells. Taking into account that the nuclear/cytosol ratio of the proteasome content declines during proliferative senescence, we postulated that the senescence-related changes in the cytosolic proteasomal system are more pronounced and that the nuclear proteasomal system is only marginally affected by the senescence process."
https://openalex.org/W1973228122,"The protein kinase C (PKC) family consists of multiple isoforms that are involved in the regulation of diverse cellular responses. Suppression of PKC induces growth arrest in various types of cells. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms have not been thoroughly investigated. In this report, we demonstrated that the concurrent inhibition, rather than separate inhibition, of phorbol ester-dependent PKC α and θ isoforms is crucial for the induction of G1 cell cycle arrest and that this negative cell cycle regulation is via p53-independent mechanisms. PKC suppression-mediated growth arrest is associated with the induction of cell cycle inhibitor p21WAF1 /CIP1 and the occurrence of hypophosphorylated Rb. The G1 checkpoint induced by the suppression of PKC occurs not only in murine Swiss3T3 but also in p53-deficient cells and human lung cancer cells containing mutated p53. Luciferase and nuclear run-off assays demonstrated that p21WAF1 / CIP1 is, in part, transcriptionally regulated in response to the suppression of PKC α and θ. However, the stability of p21 mRNA is also augmented after the addition of PKC α and θ antisense oligonucleotides, indicating the involvement of post-transcriptional mechanisms in p21WAF1 / CIP1 expression. These data suggest the existence of a cell cycle checkpoint pathway regulated by PKC α and θ isoforms. Furthermore, our findings support the notion that G1 checkpoint control can be restored in tumor cells containing abnormal p53, by targeting the PKC-regulated p21WAF1/CIP1 induction."
https://openalex.org/W1993296414,"We used a yeast one-hybrid complementation screen to identify regions within the cytosolic tails of the mouse α, β, and γ epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) important to protein-protein and/or protein-lipid interactions at the plasma membrane. The cytosolic COOH terminus of αENaC contained a strongly interactive domain just distal to the second transmembrane region (TM2) between Met610 and Val632. Likewise, γENaC contained such a domain just distal to TM2 spanning Gln573–Pro600. Interactive domains were also localized within Met1–Gln54 and the last 17 residues of α- and βENaC, respectively. Confocal images of Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with enhanced green fluorescent fusion proteins of the cytosolic tails of mENaC subunits were consistent with results in yeast. Fusion proteins of the NH2 terminus of αENaC and the COOH termini of all three subunits co-localized with a plasma membrane marker. The functional importance of the membrane interactive domain in the COOH terminus of γENaC was established with whole-cell patch clamp experiments of wild type (α, β, and γ) and mutant (α, β, and γΔQ573-P600) mENaC reconstituted in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Mutant channels had about 13% of the activity of wild type channels with 0.33 ± 0.14 versus 2.5 ± 0.80 nA of amiloridesensitive inward current at –80 mV. Single channel analysis of recombinant channels demonstrated that mutant channels had a decrease in P o with 0.16 ± 0.03 versus 0.67 ± 0.07 for wild type. Mutant γENaC associated normally with the other two subunits in co-immunoprecipitation studies and localized to the plasma membrane in membrane labeling experiments and when visualized with evanescent-field fluorescence microscopy. Similar to deletion of Gln573–Pro600, deletion of Gln573–Arg583 but not Thr584–Pro600 decreased ENaC activity. The current results demonstrate that residues within Gln573–Arg583 of γENaC are necessary for normal channel gating.

The current results demonstrate that residues within Gln573–Arg583 of γENaC are necessary for normal channel gating. Activity of integral membrane proteins is regulated, in general, by the following two means: post-translational modification, and discretionary interaction with accessory, regulatory proteins and/or lipids. These two modalities of regulation are not necessarily mutually exclusive and impact function by influencing several parameters, including protein localization and kinetics. Ion channels are integral membrane proteins that play fundamental roles in many diverse cellular processes. Similar to other membrane proteins, ion channel activity is, in part, a manifestation of channel kinetics and cellular locale. The amiloride-sensitive epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) 1The abbreviations used are: ENaC, epithelial Na+ channel; mENaC, mouse epithelial Na+ channel; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; TM, transmembrane region; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; HA, hemagglutinin; wt, wild type; ECFP, enhanced cyan fluorescent protein; EF, evanescent-field; TIRF, total internal reflection fluorescence; FRT, Fischer rat thyroid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; mt, mutant. is an ion channel localized to the luminal plasma membrane of epithelial cells (1Garty H. Palmer L.G. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 359-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar, 2Harvey K.F. Shearwin-Whyatt L.M. Fotia A. Parton R.G. Kumar S. J. Biol.

Physiol. 2000; 62: 573-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Activity of this channel is the rate-limiting step in Na+ transport across electrically tight epithelium. Thus, ENaC plays a pivotal role in Na+ and concomitant water (re)absorption across many epithelial tissues. This channel, consequently, is centrally positioned as an effector for systemic hormones and other factors that modulate blood pressure. Gain and loss of function mutations in ENaC and its regulatory pathways, indeed, cause blood pressure disorders in humans associated with aberrant Na+ and water metabolism (4Lifton R.P. Gharavi A.G. Geller D.S. Cell. 2001; 104: 545-556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1368) Google Scholar). Although it is accepted that ENaC activity is dynamically modulated by regulation of channel localization to the luminal membrane, little is actually known about the cellular control points and queues impinging upon this modulation. In addition, the specific residues and domains within the channel itself important to localization and control of channel activity remain obscure. ENaC is a member of the Deg/ENaC superfamily of ion channels (3Alvarez D.L.R. Canessa C.M. Fyfe G.K. Zhang P. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 573-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 5Benos D.J. Stanton B.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 520: 631-644Crossref Scopus (153) Google Scholar). This superfamily contains a functionally diverse array of channels that all share a common tertiary structure with members having two-transmembrane spanning regions, a large extracellular ectodomain and two short cytosolic tails. Channels within this superfamily play important roles in sensory perception, including taste, touch, hearing, nociception, and neurotransmission, as well as vectorial Na+ transport across epithelia. In native epithelia, ENaC is composed of three homologous but distinct subunits: α, β, and γ. Canessa et al. (6Canessa C.M. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C.

FEBS Lett. 1993; 318: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) were the first to identify the molecular correlates of ENaC. Most results suggest that the functional channel has a stoichiometry of two α and one β and γ subunit (9Firsov D. Gautschi I. Merillat A.M. Rossier B.C. Schild L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 344-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 10Kosari F. Sheng S. Li J. Mak D.O. Foskett J.K. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13469-13474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar); however, the alternative that the functional channel is composed of three copies of each of the three subunits has also been proposed (11Eskandari S.

Heterologously expressed αENaC alone and together with either β- or γENaC also forms homomeric and heterodimeric channels, although with much decreased activity and slightly different biophysical characteristics from the endogenous channel in native epithelia (6Canessa C.M. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1993; 361: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar, 7Canessa C.M. Schild L. Buell G. Thorens B. Gautschi I. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C.

The cytosolic tails of ENaC are believed to be regulatory domains and/or effector sites that impinge on channel gating and locale. Recent findings from our laboratory showing that the NH2 terminus of αENaC and the COOH termini of all three subunits contain domains involved in protein-protein and/or protein-lipid interactions localized to the plasma membrane are consistent with such a possibility (15Hendron E.

Moreover, deletion of the entire NH2 terminus from any subunit inactivates ENaC (16Chalfant M.L. Denton J.S. Langloh A.L. Karlson K.H. Loffing J. Benos D.J. Stanton B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32889-32896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Conversely, deletion of the complete COOH tail of β- and γ- but not αENaC activates the channel (17Snyder P.M. Price M.P. McDonald F.J. Adams C.M. Volk K.A. Zeiher B.G. Stokes J.B. Welsh M.J.

A. 1995; 92: 5699-5703Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Deletion of the latter half of the COOH tail of αENaC, however, does increase activity (19Volk K.A. Snyder P.M. Stokes J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43887-43893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). These results, as well as others, suggest that the cytosolic tails of ENaC are involved in both positive and negative regulation of channel activity. Interestingly, the COOH terminus of ENaC subunits are the least well conserved portions of the channel. It has been hypothesized that these regions may impart the well described tissue- and species-specific regulation of ENaC by allowing differential interaction with site-specific intermediary effector/accessory proteins (5Benos D.J. Stanton B.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 520: 631-644Crossref Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The most well described regulation of ENaC involving the cytosolic tails of the channel is down-regulation of activity upon binding of the ubiquitin ligase Nedd4. The WW domains within Nedd4 target this protein and similar ligases to PY motifs (XPPXY) in the distal portions of the ENaC COOH termini promoting ubiquitination of the NH2 terminus of α- and γENaC subunits and subsequent internalization of the channel (20Abriel H.

Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 407-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The cytosolic COOH tails of ENaC also contain a tyrosine-based endocytic tag overlapping the PY motif (YXXL) (22Shimkets R.A. Lifton R.P. Canessa C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25537-25541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) that in some instances is functionally independent of the PY motif at least in γENaC (15Hendron E.

Moreover, COOH tails contain SH3 binding domains (23Rotin D. Bar-Sagi D. O'Brodovich H. Merilainen J. Lehto V.P. Canessa C.M. Rossier B.C. Downey G.P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4440-4450Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Such a domain in αENaC binds the SH3 domain within α-spectrin and has been implicated in localizing the channel to the luminal membrane in epithelia. In addition, the COOH termini of β- and γENaC may impact ENaC open probability by promoting channel closing (24Copeland S.J. Berdiev B.K. Ji H.L. Lockhart J. Parker S. Fuller C.M. Benos D.J. Am. J.

All of these COOH-terminal domains, described previously (15Hendron E. Patel P. Hausenfluke M. Gamper N. Shapiro M.S. Booth R.E. Stockand J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34480-34488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), are more distal than the membrane reactive domain we recently identified in the COOH tail of γENaC. The NH2 terminus of αENaC is required for normal channel function (16Chalfant M.L. Denton J.S. Langloh A.L. Karlson K.H. Loffing J. Benos D.J. Stanton B.A. J. Biol.

Overexpression of a peptide containing this region of αENaC acts as a competitive inhibitor of wild type channels. Channels missing the first 109 residues of αENaC, in addition, have decreased activity; however, they localize to the plasma membrane (16Chalfant M.L. Denton J.S. Langloh A.L. Karlson K.H. Loffing J.

This region also contains another possible endocytic tag (KGDK) (16Chalfant M.L. Denton J.S. Langloh A.L. Karlson K.H. Loffing J. Benos D.J. Stanton B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32889-32896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and a well conserved 5-amino acid tract containing a glycine (Gly95) crucial to normal channel gating (27Grunder S. Jaeger N.F. Gautschi I. Schild L. Rossier B.C. Pfluegers Arch. 1999; 438: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Interestingly, α-rENaC is differentially spliced to produce αENaC subunits with unique NH2 termini (28Thomas C.P. Auerbach S. Stokes J.B. Volk K.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1312-C1323Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The functional ramifications of this have yet to be determined. Similar to the NH2 terminus and to the COOH terminus of the other subunits, the COOH terminus of αENaC plays a role in modulating channel activity. Binding of actin to the COOH-tail of α-rENaC increases channel open probability but decreases conductance (24Copeland S.J. Berdiev B.K. Ji H.L. Lockhart J. Parker S. Fuller C.M. Benos D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C231-C240Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The COOH terminus of αENaC also contains a region that supports channel activity and is involved in kinase regulation of the channel (19Volk K.A. Snyder P.M. Stokes J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43887-43893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In particular, residues Pro595 and Gly596 in αENaC are critical to normal localization of the channel to the plasma membrane. Thus, there is convincing evidence that the cytosolic tails of ENaC subunits affect channel activity by impacting both channel locale and gating. However, only a few residues and specific domains within these regions of ENaC have been identified in detail and linked to function. Gupta and Canessa (29Gupta S.S. Canessa C.M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 481: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) reported previously that heterologous expression of α- and β-rENaC results in yeast becoming salt- and amiloride-sensitive, demonstrating that this recombinant channel is active in this background. In the current study, we built on this earlier work by using a simple yeast one-hybrid complementation screen to define regions within the cytosolic tails of ENaC important to protein-protein and/or protein-lipid interactions at the plasma membrane. Importantly, we determined that a region within the COOH-terminal tail of γENaC identified with our yeast screen had functional ramifications in a mammalian system.

For α-, β-, and γ-mENaC, the upstream and downstream primers were 5′-CGAACTCGAGTTATGCTGGACCACACCAGAGC and 5′-GCAAGCGGCCGCTCAGAGTGCCATGGCCGGAGC; 5′-CGAACTCGAGTTATGCCAGTGAAGAAGTACC and 5′-GCAAGCGGCCGCCTAGATGGCCTCCACCTCACTG; and 5′-CGAACTCGAGTTATGGCGCCTGGAGAGAAG and 5′-GCAAGCGGCCGCTTAGAACTCATTGGTCAACTG, respectively. These primer sets engineered XhoI and NotI sites in each of the respective subunit cDNAs. The plasmids encoding fusion proteins of the full mENaC cytosolic tails and EGFP, as well as hSOS, have been described previously (15Hendron E. Patel P. Hausenfluke M. Gamper N. Shapiro M.S.

Mutagenesis of pSOS-ENaC and pMyc-γENaC Constructs—Mutagenesis of pSOS-ENaC and its derivatives was completed using QuikChange (Stratagene) site-directed mutagenesis per the manufacturer's instructions. The primers and templates used to create the deletion and truncation mutations used in the current study are listed in Table I. The pMyc-γENaCΔQ573-P600 deletion mutant was generated with 5′-GCCGCCAGTGGGCCCTGGATACGG and 5′-CCGTATCCAGGGCCCACTGGCGGC upstream and downstream primers, respectively, in conjunction with full-length pCMV-myc-γENaC.

Open table in a new tab Yeast One-hybrid Complementation Screen—The one-hybrid screen used in the current study has been described previously (15Hendron E. Patel P. Hausenfluke M. Gamper N.

In brief, S. cerevisiae cdc25H yeast transformed with pSOS-ENaC constructs were initially plated on SD/glucose (–Leu) agar at 24 °C. Colonies were allowed to form over a 4-day period. Colonies were then patched from the source plate in duplicate onto SD/glucose (–Leu) plates to create two identical arrays. Arrays were grown in parallel at permissive (24 °C) and restrictive (37 °C) temperatures. Colony formation (growth) was quantified after 2 days (refer to Fig. 1). Cdc25 is the yeast homologue of hSOS and is required for Ras-dependent growth. The yeast strain used in the current study has temperature-sensitive Cdc25 that is not functional at restrictive temperatures (37 °C). Because pSOS encodes a truncated hSOS incapable of membrane localization, hSOS-ENaC fusion proteins only activate Ras signaling and thus initiate yeast growth when information in the ENaC portion of the hybrid protein enables the full fusion protein to localize at or near the plasma membrane. Digital images of yeast plates were captured with a DC4800 Zoom Digital Camera (Eastman Kodak Co.) interfaced with a personal computer running Kodak IFS Core software. ENaC Expression in CHO Cells—CHO cells were maintained in culture with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin) by using standard methods (31Gamper N. Stockand J.D. Shapiro M.S. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 84-95Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For patch clamp analysis and confocal imaging, cells were plated on coverglass chips treated with 0.01% polylysine. Plated cells were transfected with four plasmids encoding α-, β-, and γENaC and GFP using the PolyFect reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) per the manufacturer's recommendations. In brief, cells ∼60% confluent in a 35-mm dish were treated with 2.5 μg of total plasmid cDNA for 24–48 h. Cells were used for patch clamp analysis up to 96 h after transfection and were maintained in culture in the presence of 10 μm amiloride replenished daily. Cells used for protein analysis were grown in 100-mm dishes, transfected with 4 μg of total plasmid cDNA, and extracted 24–48 h after transfection. Confocal Imaging—Transfected CHO cells were grown on number 0 coverglass, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and mounted using Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Confocal images were collected using a ×60 (1.3 NA) oil-immersion lens on a Nikon Eclipse TE2000 (Nikon Instruments, Melville, NY) inverted microscope fitted with a Cascade Photometric CCD camera (Roper Scientific, Tucson, AZ), the CARV confocal fluorescence imaging unit (Kinetic Imagine, Weston, Ontario, Canada), and a Lambda 10-2 filter wheel (Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA). This unit is driven by the Metamorph program suite (Universal Imaging Corp., Downingtown, PA) and interfaced with a piezosystem (Piezosystem Jena, Hopedale, MA) for Z-series imaging. For DsRed2 a triple pass polychroic emission filter (D/F/TXRD 62002; Chroma Technology Corp., Brattleboro, VT) was used in conjunction with a single pass excitation filter. For ECFP, images were collected using the yellow fluorescent protein/cyan fluorescent protein dual pass polychroic emission filter (cyan fluorescent protein/yellow fluorescent protein 51017v2; Chroma Technology Corp.) in conjunction with a single pass excitation filter. EGFP was visualized with a single pass dichroic emission filter (endow GFP 41017; Chroma Technology Corp.) in conjunction with a single pass excitation filter. With these filter sets, fluorophores were easily discriminated with no bleed through (see Fig. 2). Evanescent-field (EF) Fluorescence Microscopy—To selectively illuminate the plasma membrane and its associated channel subunits, we used EF microscopy. Cells used for EF microscopy were plated on glass coverslips and fixed as above for confocal imaging. Methods followed closely those described previously by Almers and colleagues (32Merrifield C.J. Feldman M.E. Wan L. Almers W. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 691-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 33Taraska J.W. Perrais D. Ohara-Imaizumi M. Nagamatsu S. Almers W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2070-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). In brief, EF microscopy was performed using an inverted TE2000 microscope with through-the-lens fluorescence imaging. EF illumination was generated by total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) after the light beam struck the interface between the glass coverslip and cellular plasma membrane at a glancing angle (34Steyer J.A. Almers W. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Samples were viewed through a Plan Apo TIRF ×60 oil-immersion, high resolution (1.45 NA) objective (Nikon). TIRF generates an EF that declines exponentially with increasing distance from the interface between the cover glass and plasma membrane illuminating only a small optical slice of the cell (∼200 nm) including the plasma membrane. Thus, with TIRF only fluorophores in the plasma membrane and its immediate vicinity contribute to emission, whereas those deeper in the cell do not (see Fig. 8A). DsRed2 and EGFP-F were excited with green HeNe and argon lasers, respectively, with emissions subsequently passing through 543- and 488-nm single pass filters, respectively. This system was also interfaced with a mercury lamp with appropriate dichroic excitation and emissions filter sets enabling wide field epifluorescence imaging of DsRed2 and EGFP-F. Images were collected and processed as above with a CCD camera interfaced to a PC running Metamorph software. Patch Clamp Recording and Single Channel Analysis—Whole-cell macroscopic current recordings of ENaC reconstituted in CHO cells were made under voltage clamp conditions using standard methods (31Gamper N. Stockand J.D. Shapiro M.S. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 84-95Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Prior to patch clamp analysis, cells were rinsed of culture media and amiloride and patched at room temperature under constant perfusion in a bath solution of (in mm) 160 NaCl, 1 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.4, 320 mOsm). Pipette solution was (in mm) 145 KCl, 5 NaCl, 2 MgCl2, 0.5 CaCl2, 10 EGTA, 10 HEPES (pH 7.4), 3.0 ATP, and 0.1 GTP (330 mOsm). Current recordings were acquired with a PC-505B patch clamp amplifier (Warner Instruments; Hamden, CT) interfaced via a Digidata 1320A (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA) with a PC running the pClamp 8.1 suite of software. All currents were filtered at 1 kHz. Both a family of test pulses stepping by 20-mV increments (500 ms each separated by 400 ms) form –120 to +100 mV, and voltage ramps (100 ms) over the same range were used to generate current-voltage (I-V) relations. The whole-cell capacitance was routinely compensated and was approximately ∼12 picofarads for CHO cells. Series resistances, on average 2–5 megohms, were also compensated. Currents, however, were not leak-corrected. For all experiments, holding potential was 30–50 mV. For v"

Current theories say this is because we perceive motion by summation: if an object slips across the retina at r°/s while the eye turns at e°/s, the object's perceived velocity in space should be r + e. We show that activity in MT+, the visual-motion complex in human cortex, does reflect a mix of r and e rather than r alone. But we show also that, for optimal perception, r and e should not summate; rather, the signals coding e interact multiplicatively with the spatial gradient of illumination."

Together, these results provide the molecular basis through which the combinatorial structure and context of the composite elements of the IL-2 promoter dictates mitogen responsiveness and drug susceptibility that are quantitatively and qualitatively distinct from the isolated action of single consensus sequences and/or transcriptional motifs. It is now widely recognized that the control of gene expression occurs through a complex cascade of molecular events that ultimately mediate the assembly of active transcriptional complexes at specific genes (1Orphanides G. Reinberg D. Cell. 2002; 108: 439-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar, 2Wyrick J.J. Young R.A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 130-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). This assembly process is dynamic and the information necessary for directing the targeting of these events is embedded within the primary sequence of promoters and 5′ regulatory regions of every gene. New insights gained from sequencing of the human genome has made it clear that this embedded information constitutes a related, though separate, language or “code” that dictates how and when genes will be activated in response to environmental stimuli (2Wyrick J.J. Young R.A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 130-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The smallest units or packets of information in this code are the single binding motifs or recognition sequences that form the substrates for sequence-specific interactions of DNA binding transcription factors. Although the practice of emphasizing individual protein-specific recognition sequences has formed a basis for thinking about the general structural organization of gene regulatory regions, it is now clear that this conceptualization is an over-simplification. The promoter sequence of many mammalian genes are highly structured and complex (3Scherf M. Klingenhoff A. Werner T. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The overwhelming plasticity in the response of the human genome to changes in its external environment is a direct reflection of this complexity. Thus, the concept of “one stimulus, one pathway, one transcription factor, and one gene” has limited utility when trying to understand gene regulation in response to diverse molecular signaling events (2Wyrick J.J. Young R.A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 130-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The regulation of transcription can now best be described as a dynamic and hierarchical process that mediates the assembly and function of multiple factors at the regulatory elements of target genes. The rationale for the assignment of the factors within this hierarchy are based on properties that include, DNA binding affinity, protein-protein interactions, enzymatic activity, and relative abundance (1Orphanides G. Reinberg D. Cell. 2002; 108: 439-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar, 4Narlikar G.J. Fan H.Y. Kingston R.E. Cell. 2002; 108: 475-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1255) Google Scholar). The first level in this hierarchy contains the sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins (e.g. AP-1, 1The abbreviations used are: AP-1, activator protein 1; TCR, T-cell receptor; CD28RE, CD28 response element; TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate; TRE, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate responsive element; PMA, phorbol myristate acetate; IL-2, interleukin-2; SB, cell permeable pyridinyl imidazole; P/I, phorbol ester + ionomycin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PHA, phytohemagglutinin; aa, amino acids; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; NFAT, nuclear factor of activated T-cells; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; GALV, Gibbon ape leukemia virus; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; UAS, upstream activation sequence; PKA, protein kinase A; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein. NF-κB, and CREB). Regulation of this hierarchy by molecular signaling events targets their nuclear accessibility, DNA binding affinity, and protein-protein interactions. The next level is represented by the transcriptional co-activator proteins or co-regulatory proteins (e.g. p300, BRG-1, and CARM). These factors have two very important roles in the hierarchy of transcriptional assembly. First, they influence chromatin structure through intrinsic enzymatic activities that can either covalently modify the chromatin or directly effect chromatin structure through ATP-dependent interactions with nucleosome structure. Second, they serve as important signal-regulated scaffolds that bridge and integrate interactions between DNA-bound factors and other transcriptional complexes. The final hierarchy contains the more abundant basal factors and type II RNA polymerase (polymerase II). Each of these hierarchies are selectively influenced by a complex series of intersecting and overlapping molecular signal cascades that achieve their final integration at the level of gene-specific promoters and 5′ regulatory regions. Several seminal observations that began to shed light on how the complex organization of promoter sequences could direct and integrate these intricate hierarchies of protein assembly were first provided by studies on the sequence structure and responsiveness of the interleukin-2 (IL-2) promoter in activated T-cells (5Hentsch B. Mouzaki A. Pfeuffer I. Rungger D. Serfling E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2657-2665Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 6Serfling E. Barthelmas R. Pfeuffer I. Schenk B. Zarius S. Swoboda R. Mercurio F. Karin M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 465-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). These initial studies clearly showed the IL-2 promoter to have a prototypical modular or “composite” organization comprised of what literally could be referred to as “modules within modules.” The most important concept to arise from these studies was that few of these modules function independently. In fact, many studies suggested that multiple cooperative interactions (both positive and negative) are coordinated within the structure of the IL-2 proximal promoter sequences (7Jain J. Loh C. Rao A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). The combinatorial “all or none” kinetics of the assembly of both T-cell specific and ubiquitous factors at the IL-2 promoter provides clear evidence of a thermodynamic linkage between these modules and events (8Chen D. Rothenberg E.V. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 931-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 9Garrity P. Chen D. Rothenberg E.V. Wold B. Mol. Cell.

The modules that make up the structure of the proximal IL-2 promoter include: the NFAT/AP-1 site (nuclear factor of activated T-cells/activator protein 1) co-bound by NFAT and AP-1 dimers; the CD28RE/AP1 site (also known as CD28RE/TRE site) co-bound by members of the NF-κB family and hetero- and homodimers of the AP-1 and CREB family; and the NFIL-2A site (also known as AP-1/Oct site) co-bound by octamer-associated factors and members of the AP-1 family (7Jain J.

A great deal of the cooperativity between factors is mediated by protein-protein interactions, not only between the DNA-bound congeners, but also by higher order interactions with other non-DNA binding molecules. Most of these non-DNA binding molecules are members of the second functional hierarchy of transcription factor assembly including p300 and CBP. Both p300 and CBP have been shown to have profound effects on the transcriptional activity of the IL-2 gene and other genes important in T-cell development (14Butscher W.G. Powers C. Olive M.

Thus their intrinsic activity and coordinated recruitment to the IL-2 promoter are likely to be major targets for regulation by signal transduction events. The p38 mitogen-activated kinase (MAPK) inhibitor, SB203580, was originally described as an inhibitor of inflammatory cytokine synthesis (reviewed in Ref. 23Lee J.C. Kumar S. Griswold D.E. Underwood D.C. Votta B.J. Adams J.L. Immunopharmacology. 2000; 47: 185-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Subsequent analysis of this class of drugs demonstrated that it could selectively inhibit the p38 MAPK family by competitive binding to the ATP pocket (24Young P.R. McLaughlin M.M. Kumar S. Kassis S. Doyle M.L. McNulty D. Gallagher T.F. Fisher S. McDonnell P.C. Carr S.A. Huddleston M.J. Seibel G. Porter T.G. Livi G.P. Adams J.L. Lee J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12116-12121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Continued use of SB203580 in many systems has revealed it to have pleiotropic effects on a variety of signal pathways through mechanisms that varied depending on cell and tissue type in addition to the final drug concentration (25Lali F.V. Hunt A.E. Turner S.J. Foxwell B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7395-7402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Several years ago it was suggested that the immunosuppressive properties of SB203580 were in part because of its ability to suppress the production of IL-2 in activated T-cells, yet the mechanism underlying this suppression was not known (26Ward S.G. Parry R.V. Matthews J. O'Neill L. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 304SCrossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In this report a transcriptional approach is used to map pharmacological actions of SB203580 at the IL-2 promoter in activated T-cells. Through this approach, we illustrate the concept that controlled gene expression is integrated by a multi-step process that can be more easily conceived of in terms of how molecular signaling events impinge on the intrinsic hierarchical nature of transcriptional complex assembly at targeted genes and how the combinatorial nature of promoter structure forms the primary blueprint for this assembly. We first pinpoint modules within the IL-2 promoter that contribute most to its mitogen activation profile by mutational analysis and principal component analysis of the transcriptional activity of the IL-2 promoter and its isolated modules and submodules. After identifying the CD28RE/AP1 (TRE) module as one that shows high correlation with the activity and mitogen profile of the IL-2 promoter, we demonstrate that its transcriptional sensitivity to SB203580 is similar to the IL-2 proximal promoter in both transformed and primary human T-cells. We then dissect the contribution of the submodules of the CD28RE/AP1 (TRE) element to SB203580 sensitivity to demonstrate that both NF-κB and CREB activity at the CD28RE/AP1 are targeted by SB203580. A major mechanism that integrates this level of targeting is shown to involve the activation-dependent phosphorylation of CREB on serine 133. Through in vivo activated kinase assays and enforced expression studies in both primary and transformed human T-cells, we show that the activity of p38 kinase plays a major role in the SB203580-mediated repression. Finally, kinetic analysis of CREB phosphorylation and CREB/p300 recruitment to the IL-2 promoter by chromatin immunoprecipitation, shows that an additional target of SB203580 is a dynamic CREB/p300 assembly that is kinetically correlated with a burst of CREB phosphorylation during T-cell activation. Results from this study demonstrate that the dynamic hierarchical assembly of higher order transcriptional complexes, coordinated by promoter modules, is a fundamental target for molecular signaling events. These findings emphasize how understanding the collective targeting of these assemblies will provide greater conceptual insights into mechanisms of signal integration than linkages between single pathways, solitary transcription factors, and isolated gene targets.

The anti-CD28 monoclonal antibody 9.3 ascites were obtained from Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Institute (Seattle, WA), and was used at a final dilution of 1:1000. Determination of Interleukin-2 Concentration—Interleukin-2 concentrations were determined by enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent analysis using the Quantikine Immunoassay kit (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Preparation of Nuclear and Whole Cell Extracts—Nuclear extracts were prepared from Jurkat T-cells as previously described (33Powers C. Krutzsch H. Gardner K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30089-30095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).

Radiolabeled phosphate incorporation was determined from data captured by a Amersham Biosciences PhosphorImager. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—1.2 × 108 Jurkat T-cells were stimulated with 50 ng/ml PMA (Sigma) and 1 μm ionomycin (Calbiochem) for the indicated times either alone or after being pretreated with 10 μm SB203580 for 2 h. Cells were fixed in 1% formaldehyde for 15 min while on ice. The formaldehyde was quenched with 125 mm glycine for 15 min on ice. Cells were washed three times in PBS, then resuspended in 1 ml of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, with 1% SDS. Cells were sonicated three times for 15 s each using a sonic dismembrator (Fisher) set at 20% of maximum output or until 95% of the cells were disrupted. Chromatin was immunoprecipitated from 500 μg of soluble chromatin from each time point using anti-p300 antibody, anti-NF-κB-p65, anti-ATF1/CREB, and anti-acetylhistone antibodies. Immunoprecipitated protein-DNA complexes were repeatedly washed in PBS/RIPA buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate in PBS), then high salt RIPA (500 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate in PBS), and then TE (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA). The cross-links were reversed overnight at 65 °C and the protein was digested in the presence of 0.5% SDS and proteinase K (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The DNA was amplified with the following primers flanking the IL-2 CD28RE/AP1 (TRE): IL-2F3.2 5′-AGTCTTTGGGGGTTTAAAGAAATTCC-3′, and IL-2RC4.2 5′-CCTTGTAAAGCTTCCATTCTATGGCC-3′ with 27–32 cycles and separated on a 2% agarose gel. Principal Component Analysis—Principal component analysis was performed on transcriptional reporter assay data after normalization to unit fold activation. Principal component analysis is a multivariate technique used for the reduction of dimensions of a data set defined by large number of independent variables. The input data set is linearly transformed to a new vector space by minimization of covariance of input variables. The principal components of transformed data set are ordered by decreasing variance so that a three-dimensional projection along the first three principal components represents most of the information content of input data set. For an input data set x of m observations of n dimensions, the procedure of principal component analysis involves setting up a covariance matrix, C, defined by, Cij=1n∑k=1n(xik-x¯i)(xjk-x¯j)(Eq. 1) where the averages x̄i and x̄j are given by, x¯i=1n∑k=1nxikandx¯j=1n∑k=1nxjk(Eq. 2) and the indices i and j take the values 1... m. The eigen vectors and eigen values of the covariance matrix C are computed by standard eigen value procedures such as singular value decomposition. The nth principal component of the input matrix x is normalized eigen vector of nth eigen value. The correlation matrix is equivalent to covariance matrix where the data set x is standardized to zero mean and unit variance. The first three major principal components of the transcriptional reporter data set were computed by minimizing Pearson correlation using the principal component analysis module of the Partek Pro Build 2001.10.22 software package (Partek Inc., St. Charles, MO) that accounted for 99.75% of the variance. Prior studies have shown that IL-2 secretion can be inhibited in antigen-stimulated T-cells by treatment with the SB203580 p38 MAPK inhibitor (26Ward S.G. Parry R.V. Matthews J. O'Neill L. Biochem.

The mechanism for this mode of repression has never been defined, although recent work has established that p38 MAPK is selectively activated in surface receptor-stimulated cells (35Zhang J. Salojin K.V. Gao J.X. Cameron M.J. Bergerot I. Delovitch T.L. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3819-3829PubMed Google Scholar, 36Yu C.T. Shih H.M. Lai M.Z. J.

Schwenk H.U. Bornkamm G. Int. J. Cancer. 1977; 19: 621-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). Although a transformed cell line, Jurkat cells maintain many of the basic molecular signaling pathways triggered during T-cell activation. It thus has served as a useful experimental model system for investigation of the transcriptional targeting of agents that influence T-cell function (38Crabtree G.R. Clipstone N.A. Annu. Rev.

https://openalex.org/W2081779512,"Chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF) express several growth arrest-specific (GAS) gene products in G0. In contact-inhibited cells, the expression of the most abundant of these proteins, the p20K lipocalin, is activated at the transcriptional level by C/EBPβ. In this report, we describe the role of C/EBPβ in CEF proliferation. We show that the expression of a dominant negative mutant of C/EBPβ (designated Δ184-C/EBPβ) completely inhibited p20K expression at confluence and stimulated the proliferation of CEF without inducing transformation. Mouse embryo fibroblasts nullizygous for C/EBPβ had a proliferative advantage over cells with one or two functional copies of this gene. C/EBP inhibition enhanced the expression of the three major components of AP-1 in cycling CEF, namely c-Jun, JunD, and Fra-2, and stimulated AP-1 activity. In contrast, the over-expression of C/EBPβ caused a dramatic reduction in the levels of AP-1 proteins. Therefore, C/EBPβ is a negative regulator of AP-1 expression and activity in CEF. The expression of cyclin D1 and cell proliferation were stimulated by the dominant negative mutant of C/EBPβ but not in the presence of TAM67, a dominant negative mutant of c-Jun and AP-1. CEF over-expressing c-Jun, and to a lesser extent JunD and Fra-2, did not growth arrest at high cell density and did not express p20K. Therefore, AP-1 interfered with the action of C/EBPβ at high cell density, indicating that these factors play opposing roles in the control of GAS gene expression and CEF proliferation.

The most abundant of these quiescence-specific proteins is a member of the lipocalin family of lipid-binding proteins, designated p20K, chicken p21, or extracellular fatty acid-binding protein (EX-FABP) (13Bedard P.A.

Cancedda R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20163-20169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Maximal expression of p20K is observed in contact-inhibited CEF and in chicken heart mesenchymal cells rendered quiescent by culture in plasma-containing rather than serum-containing medium (12Bedard P.A. Balk S.D. Gunther H.S. Morisi A. Erikson R.L. Mol. Cell Biol. 1987; 7: 1450-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Serum starvation causes a less important increase in the synthesis of p20K, whereas agents arresting cells at the G1/S border have no effect on the expression of this gene (15Mao P.L. Beauchemin M. Bedard P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8131-8139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The induction of p20K is regulated at the transcriptional level and depends on a 48-bp region of the promoter termed the quiescence-responsive unit or QRU (15Mao P.L. Beauchemin M. Bedard P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8131-8139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The QRU is both necessary and sufficient for the transcriptional activation of p20K in contact inhibited CEF. The QRU includes two C/EBP binding sites that are essential for induction in quiescent CEF. C/EBPβ, the predominant member of the C/EBP family expressed in contact-inhibited CEF, binds to both C/EBP binding sites of the QRU and is capable of inducing the expression of p20K when over-expressed in cycling CEF. We showed recently that C/EBPβ is also induced in CEF transformed by the Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) (16Gagliardi M. Maynard S. Bojovic B. Bedard P.A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2301-2313Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In these cells, C/EBPβ cooperates with AP-1 and NF-κB in the constitutive induction of the CEF-4 chemokine, a marker of v-Src transformation in CEF (16Gagliardi M. Maynard S. Bojovic B. Bedard P.A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2301-2313Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 17Dehbi M. Mbiguino A. Beauchemin M. Chatelain G. Bedard P.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1992; 12: 1490-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 18Cabannes E. Vives M.F. Bedard P.A. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 29-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The activity and expression of C/EBPβ is thus controlled by conditions associated with both the stimulation and inhibition of cell proliferation. However, the expression of a dominant negative mutant of C/EBPβ, termed Δ184-C/EBPβ, accentuated the phenotype of v-Src-transformed cells, suggesting that C/EBPβ acts mainly as a growth inhibitor in CEF cultured in vitro. In this report, we describe the proliferation of CEF expressing the dominant negative mutant Δ184-C/EBPβ. We confirm that the inhibition of C/EBP enhances proliferation in CEF, an effect dependent on the stimulation of AP-1. Thus although C/EBPβ and AP-1 cooperate in RSV-transformed cells and at the G0/G1 transition in non-transformed cells, they play opposing roles in growth-arrested CEF. This interaction regulates the expression of the growth arrest specific p20K gene and governs in part the proliferation of chicken embryo fibroblasts. Cells and Viruses—Early passages of CEF were cultured at 41.5 °C in Richter-improved minimal medium containing insulin and zinc (I+ medium, Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, CA), 5% heat-inactivated new-born serum (MediaserII, Montreal Biotech Inc., Kirkland, Quebec, Canada), 5% tryptose phosphate broth, glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin. CEFs were infected with recombinant viruses generated with the RCASBP(A) or RCASBP(B) retroviral vectors. Recombinant retroviruses used in this study have been described elsewhere (16Gagliardi M.

The TAM67 cDNA was excised from pCMV-TAM67 by BamHI restriction endonuclease digestion and subcloned into the BamHI site of the Cla12 adaptor plasmid to obtain convenient ClaI restriction sites at both the 5′ and 3′ end of the insert. The TAM67 cDNA was subsequently excised by ClaI digestion and cloned into RCASBP(A) or RCASBP(B) retroviral vectors (19Petropoulos C.J. Hughes S.H. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 3728-3737Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RCASBP vectors were transfected by the calcium phosphate method (20Graham F.L. van der Eb A. Virology. 1973; 54: 536-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar), initiating the infection of the entire CEF population. For co-expression of two different transgenes, CEF transfected with a RCASBP vector were super-infected with a second retrovirus of a different genetic subgroup (A or B). Mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEF) isolated from 15-day-old embryos were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin at 37 °C. MEF with different C/EBPβ genetic complements were isolated from littermate embryos and compared in parallel in proliferation assays. Antibodies and Western Blotting Analysis—Total cellular protein extract (30 μg) was prepared in SDS sample buffer, subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and blotted on nitrocellulose (Schleicher and Schuell, BA85). The membranes were blocked in a 5% solution of milk powder dissolved in Tris-buffered saline. The p20K and C/EBPβ antiserum generated from immunized rabbits was used at a dilution of 1:1000. This was followed by incubation with a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Pierce) and detection with a chemiluminescent substrate according to protocols provided by the manufacturer (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Antibodies for the AP-1 family members c-Jun (SC-45X or SC-44X for TAM67), JunD (SC-74X), Fra-2 (SC-604X), and p21CIP (SC-393G), as well as ERK-1 (SC-93), were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) and used according to the specifications provided by the manufacturers. The c-Fos antibody was purchased from Geneka Biotechnology Inc. (catalog no. 2000752; Montréal, Québec). The p27KIP (no. 558902) and cyclin D1 (no. 556470) antibodies were obtained from BD Pharmingen and the PhosphoPlus® Rb Antibody Kit (no. 9300) was obtained from Cell Signaling Technologies and used according to the manufacturers' guidelines. Transient Expression Assays—Transient expression assays were performed on subconfluent cells by the DEAE-dextran method as described previously (17Dehbi M. Mbiguino A. Beauchemin M. Chatelain G. Bedard P.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1992; 12: 1490-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) using a total of 20 μg of DNA consisting of 5 μg of a TPA-responsive element (TRE)-controlled chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter plasmid, 2.5 μg of a β-galactosidase expression plasmid (pCH110), and 12.5 μg of salmon sperm carrier DNA. For all transient expression assays, the activity of the CAT reporter enzyme was determined in lysates representing equal levels of β-galactosidase activity. All transfections were performed in duplicates or triplicates in at least two separate experiments. [14C]Chloramphenicol and its acetylated derivatives were separated by thin layer chromatography and quantitated using and InstantImager (Packard/Canberra). Plasmid pJFCAT/TATA is a minimal promoter construct consisting of a TATAAAA box, the initiation start site of the human β-globin gene, and the CAT reporter gene. Plasmids 3x TRE-pJFCAT/TATA, 3x μTRE-pJFCAT/TATA, and 3x PRDII pJFCAT/TATA are derivative of pJFCAT/TATA and include three copies of a TRE, mutant TRE, and PRDII domain, respectively (17Dehbi M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 22528-22537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA)—Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (16Gagliardi M. Maynard S. Bojovic B. Bedard P.A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2301-2313Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The sequence of the synthetic DNA oligomers corresponding to the TRE are (+)5′-AGCTTGTGACTCATTT-3′ and (-)5′-GATCAAATGAGTCACA-3′, whereas the μTRE oligomers include three nucleotide substitutions within the AP-1 binding site (17Dehbi M. Mbiguino A. Beauchemin M. Chatelain G. Bedard P.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1992; 12: 1490-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The radiolabeled probe was generated by end-filling reactions with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase using [α-32P]dCTP and unlabeled dGTP, dATP, and dTTP. Binding reactions were performed in a total volume of 20 μl of 1× binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 60 mm NaCl, and 5% glycerol) for 30 min at room temperature. For mobility shift assays, the radiolabeled oligonucleotides (∼10,000 cpm/0.1 ng) were incubated with 2 μg of nuclear extract in the presence of 2 μg of poly(dI-dC). Competition binding reactions were performed by pre-incubating the nuclear extract with an excess of unlabeled, end-filled wild-type TRE or mutant TRE oligonucleotides for 15 min at room temperature followed by an additional 30-min incubation with the probe. Supershift analysis of AP-1 complexes was performed by incubating AP-1-specific antibodies with the radiolabeled probe-nuclear extract binding reaction for 1 h at 4 °C. The resulting DNA-protein complexes were resolved on 4.8% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels in 0.5× TBE buffer and visualized by autoradiography. Proliferation Assays—Proliferation was analyzed for CEFs infected with RCASBP(B), RCASBP-Δ184-C/EBPβ, RCAS-c-Jun, RCAS-JunD, and RCAS-Fra-2 and the dominant negative c-Jun mutant (TAM67). Cells were split from confluent 100-mm plates into 35-mm plates and incubated for the specified number of days without change of medium. Cells were counted each day in triplicates using a Coulter counter (model Z2, Coulter Corp., Miami, FL). Analysis of MEF proliferation was performed essentially as described for CEFs. Northern Blotting Analysis—Northern blotting analysis was performed as described previously (22Bedard P.A. Alcorta D. Simmons D.L. Luk K.C. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6715-6719Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Briefly, 8 μg of total RNA were loaded per lane and separated on a 1% agarose gel containing formaldehyde. The RNA was transferred onto Nytran membranes and probed with a radiolabeled cDNA for genes of interest. A glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probe was used as control to monitor RNA loading. Genomic DNA Isolation and DNA Fragmentation Analysis—Cells scraped from tissue culture dishes and floating in the medium were collected together from 2–4 100-mm dishes and used for genomic DNA isolation. Cells were spun down at 6000 × g for 5 min. and lysed in 500 μl of TTE/RNase (10 mm Tris, pH 8, 0.25%(v/v) Triton X 100, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mg/ml RNase)/pellet at 37 °C for 1.5 h. This solution was then treated with proteinase K/SDS (to give 0.2 mg/ml proteinase K and 1% SDS in a 500 μl volume) for 2 h at 50 °C. This solution was then extracted twice with phenol/chloroform and once with chloroform and precipitated with sodium acetate and ethanol. Final pellets were typically dissolved in 50 μl Tris-EDTA, pH 8, and stored at 4 °C. Typically 2 μl of the genomic DNA was run on a 1% Separide gel (Invitrogen) to assess the degree of DNA fragmentation. C/EBPβ Is Growth-inhibitory in Cycling Embryonic Fibroblasts—To characterize the role of C/EBP in the control of CEF proliferation and quiescence-specific gene expression, we expressed the dominant negative mutant Δ184-C/EBPβ with the RCASBP retroviral vector in CEF (16Gagliardi M. Maynard S. Bojovic B. Bedard P.A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2301-2313Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Δ184-C/EBPβ encodes a protein devoid of trans-activating regions but capable of homo- and heterodimerization with members of the C/EBP family (23Kowenz-Leutz E. Twamley G. Ansieau S. Leutz A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2781-2791Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Using this approach, we showed previously that Δ184-C/EBPβ is over-expressed in all cells of the monolayer, is localized to the nucleus, and binds to C/EBP elements (16Gagliardi M. Maynard S. Bojovic B. Bedard P.A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2301-2313Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). CEFs infected with the Δ184-C/EBPβ or control RCASBP virus were grown to confluence, and p20K expression was examined by Western blotting analysis of total cell extracts (Fig. 1). Control CEFs expressed p20K at confluence (reached after day 3 in this experiment) and continued to accumulate the protein at contact inhibition (Fig. 1, lanes 3–5). In contrast, p20K was not expressed by dense CEFs infected with RCASBP-Δ184-C/EBPβ even when the cells became growth-arrested (Fig. 1, lanes 6–10, and see below). Likewise, the p20K mRNA did not accumulate in CEF expressing Δ184-C/EBPβ in response to confluence (Fig. 1B , lanes 4 and 10). Starvation of subconfluent CEF in serum-free medium was inefficient in the induction of the p20K mRNA (lanes 1–3). Moreover, substituting serum-containing for serum-free medium led to a decrease of p20K mRNA levels in density-arrested cells (lane 5). Under these conditions, CEF re-enter the cell cycle, undergo one round of cell division, and do not express p20K for a 24-h period (15Mao P.L. Beauchemin M. Bedard P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8131-8139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Serum starvation had no effect on the expression of p20K in CEF infected with the RCASBP-Δ184-C/EBPβ virus. In contrast, the over-expression of wild-type C/EBPβ caused a marked accumulation of the p20K mRNA even when cells were actively dividing; under these conditions, the p20K mRNA was induced to levels well above those observed at contact inhibition (Fig. 1B , lane 13). Therefore the expression of p20K was strictly dependent on C/EBP in CEF. These results also demonstrate the efficacy of the Δ184-C/EBPβ dominant negative mutant in density-arrested CEF. The proliferation of CEF infected with the Δ184-C/EBPβ or control RCASBP(B) virus was examined at low cell density in medium containing 5% serum (Fig. 2A). The expression of the dominant negative mutant strongly stimulated CEF proliferation. Moreover, cells infected with RCASBP-Δ184-C/EBPβ were more refractile and reached a higher cell density. However, Δ184-C/EBPβ did not promote the formation of foci in monolayers or the growth of colonies in soft agar (data not shown). Therefore the inhibition of C/EBP enhanced proliferation but did not transform CEF, which were still contact-inhibited despite reaching a higher saturation density. To determine whether C/EBPβ, the predominant C/EBP member expressed by CEF (6Kim S. Mao P.L. Gagliardi M. Bedard P.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 5718-5731Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is responsible for the inhibition of proliferation, MEFs with a disrupted C/EBPβ gene were compared with MEF harboring one or two functional copies of the gene. In proliferation assays, nullizygous C/EBPβ (-/-) MEF had a proliferative advantage over MEF expressing C/EBPβ. Nullizygous (-/-) and MEF with a single functional copy of the gene (+/-) continued to proliferate at a higher rate even as the primary fibroblasts with two functional copies of the C/EBPβ gene approached replicative senescence in culture (Fig. 2B). Therefore C/EBPβ acts as a negative regulator of embryonic fibroblast proliferation. C/EBPβ Controls CEF Proliferation through AP-1—The growth-promoting effect of Δ184-C/EBPβ is consistent with our previous observation that blocking the activity of C/EBPβ enhances CEF transformation by the Rous sarcoma virus (16Gagliardi M. Maynard S. Bojovic B. Bedard P.A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2301-2313Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). C/EBPβ is one of the transcription factors activated by pp60v-src in CEF. However, unlike AP-1, it is dispensable for the in vitro transformation of these cells by RSV. Furthermore, the v-src-dependent activation of AP-1 and C/EBPβ was affected differently by the expression of the dominant negative mutant. Although a minimal promoter controlled by C/EBP binding sites was completely inhibited, a TRE-controlled promoter was stimulated by the expression of Δ184-C/EBPβ in RSV-transformed CEF. Therefore, we sought to determine whether the growth stimulatory effect of Δ184-C/EBPβ was mediated by the induction of AP-1. Transient expression assays performed on CEF infected with the Δ184-C/EBPβ or parental RCASBP(B) virus confirmed the activation of the TRE-controlled promoter in the presence of the dominant negative mutant (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the minimal promoter controlled by multiple copies of PRDII, an element recognized by p50 NF-κB1 in cycling CEF (18Cabannes E. Vives M.F. Bedard P.A. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 29-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), was not activated by the dominant negative mutant of C/EBPβ. Finally, the minimal promoter construct pJFCAT/TATA or a derivative including multiple copies of a mutant TRE did not respond to the action of Δ184-C/EBPβ. This was true for cells grown in medium containing 5 or 1% serum (data not shown). Therefore the stimulation of AP-1 by Δ184-C/EBPβ was specific and not dependent on pp60v-src. The level of TRE binding activity (AP-1) was then examined by EMSA. As shown in Fig. 3B, CEFs expressing the dominant negative mutant exhibited higher levels of AP-1 activity than control cells infected with the parental RCASBP virus. Competition assays with an excess of the homologous TRE oligonucleotide or a mutant form of this element confirmed the specificity of the TRE nucleoprotein complex. The components of AP-1 were identified by EMSAs using antibodies for various Jun or Fos family members. The appearance of supershifted complexes confirmed that dimers of Fra-2/JunD, and, to a lesser extent, Fra-2/c-Jun account for the majority of, if not all, AP-1 activity of cycling CEF. c-Fos was not detected in this complex (Fig. 4A). We then examined the level of these proteins in cells expressing Δ184-C/EBPβ or infected with the control virus (Fig. 4B). All three proteins were expressed at higher levels in CEF expressing the dominant negative mutant (Fig. 4B , lane 1 versus lane 4). In contrast, the steady state level of all three components of AP-1 was markedly reduced in CEF over-expressing C/EBPβ, whereas the expression of p20K was strongly stimulated in these cells (Fig. 4B , lanes 7 and 8). Therefore these data suggest that C/EBPβ is a negative regulator of the expression of c-Jun, JunD, and Fra-2 in CEF. The activity of C/EBPβ is induced in contact inhibited CEF where it drives the expression of quiescence-specific genes such as p20K (6Kim S. Mao P.L. Gagliardi M. Bedard P.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 5718-5731Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore one would expect that the expression of c-Jun, JunD, and Fra-2 be reduced in density-arrested cells as a result of C/EBPβ activation. To address this question, we compared the levels of all three components of AP-1 in actively dividing (G), contact-inhibited (CI), and serum-starved (S) CEF; as shown in Fig. 4B, the level of c-Jun decreased at contact inhibition but not markedly in CEF over-expressing Δ184-C/EBPβ (lane 2 versus 5). Contact inhibition did not cause a reduction in the expression of JunD but altered the relative abundance of JunD isofoms. The accumulation of a faster migrating JunD protein suggests that quiescent CEFs express predominantly the truncated and less potent Jun D isoform described by other investigators (24Short J.D. Pfarr C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32697-32705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These changes were partly antagonized by the expression of the dominant negative mutant Δ184-C/EBPβ although less drastically for the faster migrating JunD isoform. Fra-2 expression was nearly abolished at contact inhibition in the absence or presence of Δ184-C/EBPβ expression. Similar results were observed for Fra-2 in response to serum starvation (Fig. 4B , lanes 3 and 6). Interestingly, c-Jun was repressed at contact inhibition but not by serum starvation (Fig. 4B , lane 3). To characterize the induction of p20K in conditions of AP-1 down-regulation, we compared the levels of p20K and c-Jun in cycling CEF (Fig. 4C , lanes 1 and 4), in CEFs reaching confluence (lanes 2 and 5), and in contact-inhibited CEFs 2 days after reaching confluence (lanes 3 and 6). This was done for cells infected with the RCASBP control virus or RCASBP-Δ184-C/EBPβ (Fig. 4C , lanes 1–3 and 4–6, respectively). High levels of c-Jun correlated with the absence of p20K in CEF expressing Δ184-C/EBPβ. However, p20K was maximally induced in control CEF reaching confluence, i.e. in conditions where c-Jun was not fully down-regulated. Using transient expression assays, we examined the activity of a TRE-controlled promoter in actively dividing, contact-inhibited, and serum-starved CEF (Fig. 4D). This activity decreased in growth-arrested CEF even in the presence of the dominant negative mutant Δ184-C/EBPβ, which was growth-stimulatory mainly in actively dividing CEF. Therefore the expression and activity of AP-1 is controlled by C/EBP in cycling CEF, but other factors cooperate to inhibit AP-1 and particularly Fra-2 expression during growth arrest. To assess the role of AP-1 in the proliferation of Δ184-C/EBPβ infected CEF, we over-expressed the TAM67 deletion mutant of c-Jun with the RCASBP(A) vector. TAM67 encodes the rat c-Jun protein devoid of trans-activation domains but capable of homo- and heterodimerization with members of the Jun and Fos families (25Alani R. Brown P. Binetruy B. Dosaka H. Rosenberg R.K. Angel P. Karin M. Birrer M.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1991; 11: 6286-6295Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Stable expression of the c-Jun deletion mutant was confirmed by Western blotting analysis (Fig. 5A). TAM67 markedly inhibited the proliferation of CEF expressing Δ184-C/EBPβ. This inhibition was comparable with that of CEF expressing TAM67 alone, suggesting that the proliferation of control CEF and CEF over-expressing Δ184-C/EBPβ is critically dependent on AP-1. TAM67 is known to induce growth arrest by enhancing p53 and p21Waf1 expression (26Schreiber M. Kolbus A. Piu F. Szabowski A. Mohle-Steinlein U. Tian J. Karin M. Angel P. Wagner E.F. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 607-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). However the level of these proteins was not altered by the over-expression of TAM 67 or Δ184-C/EBPβ in CEF (data not shown). In contrast cyclin D1, a known target of AP-1 (27Bakiri L. Lallemand D. Bossy-Wetzel E. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2056-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 28Wisdom R. Johnson R.S. Moore C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 188-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar), was induced in cells expressing Δ184-C/EBPβ (Fig. 5B). T"

Immunoprecipitation studies from cross-linked rat synaptosomes demonstrate that an endogenous syntaphilin-dynamin-1 complex exists independently of dynamin-1 binding to amphiphysin. Functionally, syntaphilin expression inhibits transferrin internalization in COS-7 cells.
