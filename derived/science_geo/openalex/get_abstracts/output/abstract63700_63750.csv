With the monkey's arm held semiprone in a cast hinged at the elbow, we reinforced active elbow movements and tested cell responses to passive elbow movements. With the cast immobilized we reinforced isometric contraction of each of the four muscles in isolation, and bursts of cortical cell activity with and without simultaneous suppression of muscle activity. Correlations between a precentral cell and specific arm muscles consistently appeared under several behavioral conditions, but could be dissociated by reinforcing cell activity and muscle suppression."
https://openalex.org/W1644961992,"Abstract Colicin E1 was purified from mitomycin C-induced Escherichia coli JC411 (ColE1) by salt extraction of extracellular, bound colicin followed by ammonium sulfate fractionation and ion exchange chromatography. The purified preparation was considered homogeneous by several criteria. Gel filtration on Sephadex G-200 revealed no additional protein components and only a single band was observed upon cellulose acetate and isoelectric gradient electrophoresis. Sedimentation velocity and equilibrium studies, respectively, indicated the presence of a single molecular species with an s020,ω equal to 3.0 S and a molecular weight of 56,000. Double diffusion experiments using antisera prepared against purified colicin E1 yielded a single precipitin line in agar gel. Colicin E1 is a simple protein and no other moieties could be detected in association with the molecule. The isoelectric point (pI) of colicin E1, as determined by electrofocusing, is 9.05, and amino acid analysis revealed a high lysine and arginine content. A single NH2-terminal amino acid, methionine, was recovered in approximately equimolar yield per mole of protein. Circular dichroism spectra of purified colicins E1, E2, and E3 indicated a greater α-helix content in colicin E1 when compared to the other two colicins. Finally, high concentrations of purified colicin E1 were active against sensitive, immune, and resistant strains; however, relatively lower concentrations exhibited a normal activity spectrum."

https://openalex.org/W1484275600,"Abstract Five separate low density lipoproteins (LD lipoproteins) have been isolated from the plasma of a group of subjects with the disease hyper-pre-β-lipoproteinemia. These lipoproteins have been shown to be discrete, stable components within the LD lipoprotein class which may be isolated repeatedly, by differential density ultracentrifugation, from the serum of these subjects. Immunological study of the delipidized apoproteins shows only a reactivity with the LD lipoprotein antiserum. Electron microscopy reveals spherical macromolecules. Their sedimentation coefficients and hydrated densities have been measured, and their calculated average molecular weights are 4.9, 4.3, 3.2, 2.5, and 1.3 million. Compositional studies show an increasing lipid content with increasing molecular size. Of particular interest is the observation that the mass of protein per mole of lipoprotein remains constant although the molecular weight of these lipoproteins more than doubles, and thus the LD liproprotein components differ only in their lipid content. On the basis of equilibrium-banding experiments in linear density gradients, it is concluded that these lipoproteins exist within the LD lipoprotein class as discrete entities which presumably constitute energetically favorable associations of lipid and protein. Based on the sequential nature of their molecular weights and their known composition, it appears that these lipoproteins may be generated by the addition of specific increments or packets of lipid consisting of multiples of 6.25 x 105 g per mole of lipoprotein. It is postulated that the periodicity observed in the molecular weights reflects the structural limitations imposed upon these macromolecules by the apoprotein which determines the amount of lipid which may be bound. The marked density and molecular weight heterogeneity observed within the lipoproteins constituting the LD lipoprotein class in these subjects with the disease hyper-pre-β-lipoproteinemia is in apparent contrast to that observed with LD lipoprotein from normal subjects. It is thus tempting to speculate that a structurally altered apoprotein occurs in these patients which binds lipid in an atypical fashion and thus generates the multiple components found within the LD lipoprotein class of these subjects with this familial disease."

https://openalex.org/W1534779193,"Abstract The role of synthesis and of degradation in regulation of malic enzyme concentration in the liver of growing chicks has been studied. Malic enzyme was assayed by enzymic activity and by immunological analysis with immunoglobulin containing specific anti-malic enzyme. Quantitative immunoprecipitin curves and equivalence point determinations indicated that there was a constant relationship between immunologically precipitable protein and units of enzyme activity in livers of neonatal and growing chicks during a time period in which total enzyme activity increased 60-fold. Hence, changes in malic enzyme activity were due to changes in enzyme content of the liver rather than to activation or inhibition of preformed enzyme. The relative rate of malic enzyme synthesis was determined by measuring incorporation of counts into malic enzyme protein after pulse labeling total protein with l-[4,5-3H2]leucine. Malic enzyme protein was purified by quantitative precipitation of the enzyme by antibody followed by disc gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. Radioactivity in the band corresponding to malic enzyme was estimated after electrophoresis of the immunoprecipitate. Relative to synthesis of total protein, the rate of synthesis of malic enzyme increased more than 50-fold when neonatal chicks were fed. Starvation of week-old chicks for 2 days caused a 60 to 70% decrease in synthesis of malic enzyme. Degradation of malic enzyme was very slow in unfed, neonatal chicks (tfrac12; = 350 hours). Feeding, which increased the synthesis and concentration of malic enzyme also caused an increase in the rate of degradation. In 8- and 11-day-old chicks degradation of malic enzyme was found to be first order with a tfrac12; of 55 hours. In fasting chicks a t½ of 28 hours was observed, but there was also an increase in the rate of degradation of total liver protein suggesting that part of the increased rate of degradation of malic enzyme was due to a general increase in protein breakdown. The temporal relationship between synthesis of malic enzyme and synthesis of fatty acids was studied in unfed neonatal chicks given a single glucose meal. Fatty acid synthesis from [1-14C]acetate was increased 7-fold at 1 ½ hours and 20-fold at 3 hours after the glucose meal. Neither the activity nor the synthesis of malic enzyme were increased at 3 hours but both were significantly increased at 6 hours (100% and 160%, respectively). These results suggest that the increased synthesis of malic enzyme may have been initiated by an increased flux through the pathway for fatty acid synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W32125383,"Abstract On the assumption that all amino acids entering protein must pass through the intracellular pool of free amino acids, reutilization of leucine, lysine, arginine, and alanine was determined by pulse labeling of HeLa cell protein, followed by a chase in unlabeled medium and measurement of the specific activities of the intracellular free pool and protein amino acids. The half-lives of the amino acids in protein were similar (approximately 72 hours), as were those of the intracellular free pool amino acids (approximately 25 hours). When specific activity values were compared between pool and protein at 10 hours, reutilization based on this assumption was found to be about 40% for lysine, leucine, and arginine and about 20% for alanine. Because the turnover rates of HeLa cell protein constituents differ widely, and because the truth of the stated assumption was doubtful, a more accurate measure of reutilization was sought. The intracellular pools of free lysine, leucine, and phenylalanine in unlabeled HeLa cells were equilibrated with the amino acids in labeled medium (40 min), and a protein (ferritin) was then induced over 3 hours, before the bulk of the protein had acquired significant labeling. Ferritin was then isolated by immunoprecipitation and its specific activity was measured and compared to that of the intracellular free pools and the medium. Reutilization of leucine was 81%, lysine, 86%, and phenylalanine, 84%. Moreover, the specific activity of leucine in newly induced ferritin was 30% lower than that of leucine in the free pool, and that of ferritin phenylalanine was 62% lower than pool phenylalanine, showing the separation into compartments of amino acids, part derived from protein breakdown and reutilized and part derived from the intracellular free pool of amino acids."
https://openalex.org/W1619234571,"A new mutant of Bacillus subtilis is described lacking the activity of branched chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase. The mutant requires short branched chain fatty acids biosynthetically related to leucine, isoleucine, and valine for growth. Long branched chain fatty acids derived from these short molecules can also serve as growth factors. One type of branched chain fatty acid, however, is sufficient to support growth of the mutant at 37°, although wild type cells of B. subtilis normally contain three different pairs of long branched chain fatty acids. Therefore, this mutant allows extensive alterations of the fatty acid composition in membranes of B. subtilis. Straight chain fatty acids do not support growth. Out of a series of tested analogues, 2-methylvalerate, 2-ethyl butyrate, and trimethylacetate were found to be active in vivo as primer molecules of branched chain fatty acid biosynthesis. The chain-lengthened products derived from these primer substrates were characterized by mass spectrometry."

The 90 percent reduction of spectral sensitivity in the blue region has lasted more than 5 months. Reduced sensitivity to long wavelengths is produced by adaptation to light of 520 nanometers. This reduced sensitivity, which lasts no more than 30 days, is attributed to a temporary loss of response of the cones containing a photopigment with peak absorption at 535 nanometers."
https://openalex.org/W1497291145,"Abstract An amber mutant of bacteriophage T7, obtained by mutagenesis with hydroxylamine, fails to induce the T7 polynucleotide ligase upon infection of Escherichia coli. The mutant (T7amHA13) grows normally on a suppressor-negative host; its sensitivity to ultraviolet light is the same as that of wild type T7. The DNA synthesized upon infection of E. coli by T7amHA13 is identical with that synthesized after infection by wild type phage, as measured by sedimentation in alkaline sucrose gradients. However, T7amHA13 does not grow in a ligase-deficient mutant of E. coli, E. coli N1318. Small fragments (11 S) of DNA accumulate after T7amHA13 infection of N1318, suggesting that the T7 ligase plays a role in DNA replication, but that the wild type host can supply sufficient ligase activity for growth of phage T7."
https://openalex.org/W2083793693,"Cellular DNA was measured by high-speed flow microfluorometry in mammalian diploid and heteroploid cell populations stained by the fluorescent-Feulgen procedure. Heteroploid cells with elevated modal chromosome number showed the expected increase in modal DNA content. However, the variability of DNA content was the same in diploid and heteroploid cell populations despite the large variability of chromosome number in the latter populations. This suggests that heteroploidy may include defects in the chromosomal condensation and kinetochore development systems."

https://openalex.org/W1525326122,"Abstract The S-100 protein was purified from bovine brain by ammonium sulfate precipitation, ion exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sephadex, and gel filtration through Sephadex G-100. Aggregation by disulfide bond formation results in the appearance of more than one peak of the S-100 protein on DEAE-Sephadex and Sephadex G-100. Aggregation can be reversed by incubation with 0.01 m 2-mercaptoethanol for 1 hour at 60°. At least one sulfhydryl group is exposed to Ellman's reagent by calcium or, less effectively, by magnesium and strontium. The protein contains three subunits. One of these can be separated from the other two by ion exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sephadex in 8 m urea. The separated subunit has the only tryptophan in the S-100 protein and does not contain arginine. The amino acid composition suggests the other two subunits are different. When the lysines of these two subunits are blocked by maleylation, trypsin cleaves only at the two arginines in these two subunits. Only two fragments of 2000 and 5000 molecular weight result, suggesting the two subunits are structurally similar."

These soluble proteins have been partially fractionated by column chromatography as a preliminary step to studying their physical and functional properties. Optical rotatory dispersion spectra indicate no major conformational change upon removal of the proteins from the insoluble lipid in the solvent systems studied. Preliminary investigation of porcine cerebral myelin and bovine heart inner mitochondria suggest that the interaction between lipid and protein differs in these two systems from that in the human erythrocyte membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1582439177,"Abstract The binding of thyroxine, triiodothyronine, and diiodothyronine to prealbumin, and to the prealbumin-retinol-binding protein (RBP) complex has been investigated by measurements of the quenched tryptophan fluorescence and by equilibrium rate dialysis. Fluorescence quenching revealed a single site of high affinity for prealbumin and the prealbumin-RBP complex. The binding constants under physiological conditions for the combination of prealbumin with a single molecule of thyroxine, triiodothyronine, and diiodothyronine were 1.1 x 107 m-1, 1.3 x 106 m-1, and 6.2 x 104 m-1, respectively. At pH 7.4, the binding of thyroxine to prealbumin was less sensitive to temperature changes within the range 2–40° than the binding between triiodothyronine and prealbumin. The calculated thermodynamic constants were compatible with the difference in ionization of thyroxine and triiodothyronine at pH 7.4. The phenolic hydroxyl group of thyroxine, bound to prealbumin, is highly ionized at this pH, whereas the phenolic hydroxyl group of triiodothyronine is essentially un-ionized. Variations of pH exerted a marked influence on the association constants for the thyroid hormones and prealbumin. Thus an increase in the binding strength under conditions promoting ionization of the phenolic hydroxyls indicated that this group participates in the binding with prealbumin. Reduced and carboxymethylated prealbumin did not show any binding to thyroxine but retained completely its affinity for the retinol-binding protein. The binding of thyroxine and triiodothyronine to prealbumin and to the prealbumin-RBP complex were also investigated over a wide range of ligand to protein ratios by means of equilibrium rate dialysis. Identical results were obtained for both hormones irrespective of whether prealbumin was free or in complex with RBP. A single site of high affinity, and three sites of weaker affinity were revealed. The differences in binding characteristics between the sites of high and low affinities would be most easily explained by assuming a negative homotropic effect of the thyroid hormone binding."
https://openalex.org/W1579993194,"Abstract Escherichia coli K-12 has been shown to possess two transport systems for aspartate. One system specified by the genotype dct is nonspecific toward a wide variety of C4-dicarboxylic acids whereas another system specified by the genotype ast is more specific for aspartate and transports this substrate with a much higher affinity. The existence of these two systems was unequivocally shown from a comparison of the kinetics of transport, patterns of competitive inhibition, and by isolation and characterization of mutants devoid of each system or both. Aspartate was accumulated by strains with a tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolic block (citrate synthase), however, cells without this lesion were unable to do so due to rapid catabolism. C4-Dicarboxylic acids which enter the cell via the dct system were not accumulated. Membrane vesicles actively transported and accumulated aspartate and were stimulated by d(-)-lactate, however, membrane vesicles from ast strains did not accumulate aspartate and were not stimulated by d(-)lactate. C4-Dicarboxylic acids, although transported, were not accumulated and no stimulation by d(-)-lactate was observed. The low affinity dct system was absolutely necessary for dicarboxylic acid catabolism, whereas the ast high affinity system was not. The high affinity system, however, could be shown to be adequate to serve as a transport system for aspartate as a nitrogen source and as a supply route for the C4 acids required for anaplerosis."

From the far ultraviolet circular dichroic spectra, about half of the peptide groups were estimated to form β structures and the other half to be essentially unordered. The internal organization of TBPA appears not to change between pH 12 and 3.5. There is a structural transition between pH 3.5 and 2.5 which involves exposure of all of the buried aromatic chromophores. TBPA is not dissociated in strong acid or alkali or in 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate."
https://openalex.org/W1501210249,"Both orotate and 5-fluoroorotate are precursors of hepatic RNA. Whereas [6-14C]orotate was extensively incorporated into ribosomal RNA after a 3-hour period, 5-fluoro[2-14C]-orotate was selectively incorporated into nonribosomal ribonucleoprotein particles. These analogue-labeled RNA-protein complexes were released from polyribosomes by EDTA treatment and were distinctly different from ribosomal subunit particles, based on their polydisperse sedimentation in sucrose gradients, relatively lower buoyant density in CsCl gradients, and insensitivity to actinomycin D. Orotic acid and 5-fluoroorotic acid were incorporated equally well into nuclear mRNA-containing ribonucleoprotein particles. These results suggested that the analogue was selectively incorporated into an RNA which exists in the cell as a relatively low density RNA-protein complex. Analysis of microsomal RNA showed little or no incorporation of 5-fluoroorotic acid into either 18 S or 28 S rRNA for at least 3 hours. A small level of incorporation into rRNA was observed 24 hours after the administration of labeled analogue. Electrophoretic analysis of nuclear RNA demonstrated that the analogue was rapidly incorporated into 45 S ribosomal precursor RNA but that its subsequent incorporation into mature 18 S and 28 S rRNA was significantly inhibited. The kinetics of labeling of the various nuclear and cytoplasmic rRNA species was identical whether one labeled with 5-fluoroorotate alone, or with labeled orotate simultaneously with an equimolar dose of unlabeled analogue. Based on these results, and its relative nontoxicity at the dose levels employed, it is proposed that 5-fluoroorotic acid may in mammalian systems be useful for the selective inhibition of rRNA synthesis, resulting in the selective incorporation of a labeled precursor into a cytoplasmic RNA having several properties of mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1570156591,"Abstract Prealbumin was isolated from human plasma by ammonium sulfate fractionation, chromatographic separations on diethylaminoethyl-Sephadex, and gel filtrations. The highly purified protein was subjected to quantitative amino acid analyses, which showed a minimum of 140 amino acid residues per prealbumin molecule. By determination of the minimum in the curves for the fraction of maximum deviation it was found that the minimum molecular weight for prealbumin was 15,500. Molecular weight determinations by sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugations gave a value of 62,500 ± 2,200. These results indicate that prealbumin is composed of four subunits. Molecular weight determinations by gel chromatography in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride gave values of about 16,000 for prealbumin. By this method it was shown that the subunits are held together by noncovalent bonds. A trypsin digest of prealbumin was examined by peptide-mapping techniques and the number of peptides (15 to 19) detected was in good agreement with the total number of lysine and arginine residues calculated from the amino acid composition of a prealbumin tetramer consisting of four identical chains. The NH2-terminal sequence of the protein was shown to be uniquely Gly-Pro. Prealbumin, reduced and 14C-carboxymethylated, was subjected to tryptic digestion, and the radioactivity was used to trace and isolate the cysteine-containing peptides. Only one peptide contained radioactivity, and analysis of this peptide revealed the unique sequence Gly-Pro-Ser-Met-Val-Cys(Cm)-Lys. These data strengthen the view that preal-bumin is composed of identical subunits. The mode of dissociation of the prealbumin tetramer was investigated by sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation in various concentrations of guanidine hydrochloride. Determinations of local weight and number average molecular weights were consistent with three species being involved in chemical equilibrium, i.e. monomers, dimers, and tetramers of the prealbumin subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1517056611,"Abstract Vitamin D circulates in human plasma bound to a specific transport protein. This protein differs from the lipoproteins and has a hydrated density greater than 1.21. The purification of the human vitamin D-binding protein was accomplished by use of ammonium sulfate fractionation, DEAE-Sephadex chromatography, sulfoethyl-Sephadex chromatography, and gel chromatography. These procedures resulted in a highly purified preparation of the vitamin D-binding protein which had been purified approximately 15,000-fold. The purified protein appeared homogeneous by Ouchterlony immunodiffusion analyses, immunoelectrophoresis, and by analytical ultracentrifugation. The vitamin D-binding protein separated into two components on electrophoresis, both with α1 mobility. The most anodal component carried vitamin D3, whereas the cathodal form of the vitamin D-binding protein was devoid of this form of the vitamin. The molecular weight of the vitamin D-binding protein determined by equilibrium ultracentrifugation and estimated from the sedimentation coefficient and gel chromatography was approximately 53,000. Determinations of the molecular weight of reduced and alkylated vitamin D-binding protein in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride gave the same value as found under physiological conditions, suggesting that this protein is not composed of subunits. The frictional ratio (f/f0) was low for the vitamin D-binding protein, indicating a close to spherical appearance for this protein. The occurrence of the vitamin D-binding protein in normal serum, normal urine, and normal cerebrospinal fluid was established by Ouchterlony immunodiffusion analyses with use of a specific antiserum against the vitamin D-binding protein. Indirect estimates indicated that the normal concentration of this protein in serum is approximately 5 µg per ml."
https://openalex.org/W1589528471,"Heparin was degraded with nitrous acid to yield carbohydrate-serine compounds with uronic acid located at the terminal, nonreducing position. In addition, a tetrasaccharide with the proposed structure, uronosyl-N-acetylglucosaminyl-uronosyl-anhydromannose was isolated from heparin by a similar procedure. On digestion with liver β-glucuronidase, between one-third and all of the uronic acid located at the terminal position of these fragments was liberated as glucuronic acid. The results indicate that a large portion of the glucuronidic linkages of heparin have the β configuration. Furthermore, one of the β-glucuronidase-treated fragments served as acceptor for glucuronic acid when incubated with UDP-[14C]glucuronic acid and a particulate enzyme preparation derived from a heparin-producing mouse mastocytoma. Previous treatment of the heparin fragment with β-glucuronidase was mandatory for acceptor activity. On digestion of the radioactive product with β-glucuronidase, all of the radioactivity was released as [14C]glucuronic acid."

https://openalex.org/W1650721813,"Abstract The fluorescence properties of the human prealbumin-retinol-binding protein (RBP) complex and of its individual components are described. At neutral pH, RBP and the protein complex have two fluorescence bands: one at 335 nm and the other, associated with the retinol, at 470 nm. Prealbumin has only a fluorescence at 335 nm (quantum yield 0.11). The quantum yield of retinol increased by 50% and the emission spectrum was blue shifted on RBP forming a complex with prealbumin. RBP, at low ionic strength where the binding of RBP and prealbumin is abolished, exhibited a decrease in the quantum yield of retinol. With the protein fluorescence of RBP and the fluorescence of its cofactor, it was also possible to show the occurrence of transfer of excitation energy from the protein moiety to the retinol (efficiency of transfer: 60%). Studies on the accessibility of the aqueous medium (or protons) to the retinol site revealed that on complex formation between RBP and prealbumin most of the retinol-solvent interactions are abolished, suggesting that one of the functions of prealbumin is to stabilize the retinol-binding site of RBP. The estimated apparent association constant is 2 x 107 m-1 for the interaction of retinol-containing RBP and prealbumin. The binding constant of prealbumin and vitamin A-free RBP was also determined. A similar value was found and it is thus concluded that retinol has no major influence on the tertiary structure of RBP."
https://openalex.org/W1576717850,"Abstract Bacillus subtilis nucleoside diphosphokinase was purified 1,100-fold to apparent homogeneity (a single band upon disc gel electrophoresis). Gel filtration through Sephadex G-200 indicated an approximate molecular weight of 100,000. The corrected Michaelis constants for the various nucleoside triphosphate substrates ranged from 0.10 mm for GTP to 0.42 mm for CTP. Deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates as well as ribonucleoside triphosphates served as substrates for the enzyme. Mn2+ and Mg2+ both were able to fulfill the divalent cation requirements for enzyme activity. Mn2+ was maximally activating at 1 mm while Mg2+ was maximally activating at 10 mm. The purified enzyme reacts with [γ-32P]ATP yielding a phosphorylated enzyme in which the phosphate group is bound via a 1-phosphohistidine bond. The equilibrium between the free and phosphorylated enzyme form favors the free form, indicating that the 1-phosphohistidine bond has a free energy of hydrolysis more negative than the terminal ATP bond. Initial velocity and product inhibition kinetic studies suggest a ping pong reaction mechanism (the first product dissociates before the second substrate combines with the enzyme). This is consistent with the postulation that the phosphorylated protein associated with enzyme activity is an intermediate in the enzymatic reaction."
https://openalex.org/W2145012665,"Abstract The immune macroglobulin from the paddlefish, Polyodon spathula, was purified and characterized physicochemically. The macroglobulin had a sedimentation coefficient of 14.2 S and a molecular weight of 660,000. Total reduction and alkylation in 7 m guanidine hydrochloride resulted in dissociation into heavy (H) and light (L) chains. The H and L chains were separated by gel filtration and found to have molecular weights of 58,100 and 21,000, respectively, employing sedimentation equilibrium in 5.0 m guanidine hydrochloride. Based on absorbance, equimolar quantities of the chains were recovered from the macroglobulin. These data are compatible with previously reported electron microscopic studies (Acton, R. T., Weinheimer, P. F., Dupree, H. K., Russell, T. R., Wolcott, M., Evans, E. E., Schrohenloher, R. E., and Bennett, J. C., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A., 68, 107 (1971)), which demonstrated a tetrameric structure for the immune macroglobulin, and indicated that the structural subunit consists of two H and two L chains. Generally the amino acid composition was similar to mammalian IgM H and L chains. Although no NH2-terminal group was detected in the light chain, the sequence of the first 5 residues from the NH2-terminus of the H chain was found to be [see PDF for sequence]. These data provide additional evidence for a structural similarity among phylogenetically distinct immune macroglobulins and suggest a common evolutionary origin."
https://openalex.org/W1504801759,"Abstract Anthranilate synthetase from Serratia marcescens was purified to homogeneity. Criteria for homogeneity were disc gel electrophoresis, sedimentation analysis, and immunodiffusion. During electrofocusing the enzyme was found to have an isoelectric pH of 4.6. Glutamine- and ammonia-dependent activities superimposed during electrofocusing. Glutamine-dependent activity showed a pH optimum of 7.6, while ammonia-dependent activity was optimal above pH 8.5, indicating that NH3 rather than NH4+ was involved in the reaction mechanism. The enzyme was sensitive to feedback inhibition by very low concentrations of l-tryptophan. The mercurial, p-chloromercuribenzoate, was found to be ineffective in desensitizing the enzyme to tryptophan inhibition. However, glutamine utilization was selectively and reversibly blocked. Chorismate enhanced this inactivation, while glutamine and a mixture of glutamine and chorismate were increasingly effective protective agents. A molecular weight of 140,000 was estimated from sucrose gradient centrifugation (7.6 S). The molecular weight on Sephadex gel filtration was 150,000."

https://openalex.org/W1506732660,"Abstract The activation of glycogen synthetase by insulin proceeds via the transformation of the less active D form to the active I form, with essentially no change in total activity. Although the enhancement of glycogen deposition has also been attributed to glucocorticoid activation of glycogen synthetase, insulin-induced activation is counteracted by hydrocortisone in diabetic and starved rats. The time-dependent activation of glycogen synthetase in crude liver extracts, which has been used as a model for activation of the enzyme by various agents, has now been demonstrated with more purified preparations. With the purified system the characteristics of the in vitro activation have been compared to the in vivo hormonally induced activation. In contrast to the in vivo case, the total activity of glycogen synthetase increased during activation in vitro in addition to the increase in the I activity. The effect of various cellular metabolites on the in vitro activation kinetics is profoundly altered by EDTA. Certain properties of the synthetase system, such as the ratio of D to I form, the Km for UDP-glucose, and the in vitro activation, are temperature-dependent."

https://openalex.org/W1824661078,"Abstract The reaction of α-bromo-4-hydroxy-3-nitroacetophenone (BHNA) with transglutaminase in the presence of CaCl2 (25 mm) produces a catalytically inactive labeled protein in which the phenacyl group is covalently attached to the active site —SH. The spectral properties of this group attached to the enzyme are consistent with that of the group in a hydrophobic region of the molecule. Addition of ethylenediaminetetraacetate results in a shift of the spectrum toward shorter wave lengths, indicative of a more polar environment for this —SH in the absence of Ca++. Attachment of the phenacyl group to positions in the enzyme other than the active —SH by reaction with BHNA in the absence of Ca++ results in losses in transferase activity, but essentially no loss in esterase activity. The spectrum of the groups bound to enzyme in the absence of Ca++ is identical with that of the phenacyl group in water. This spectrum is unchanged by subsequent addition of Ca++. In the catalytically inactive forms of transglutaminase, produced by the reaction of d and l forms of methyl N-(2-hydroxy-5-nitrophenylacetyl)-2-amino-4-oxo-5-chloropentanoate (PACK) and 1-chloro-4-(2-hydroxy-5-nitrophenylacetyl)amidobutan-2-one (PBCK) with enzyme in the presence of Ca++, the phenolic reporter group is attached covalently to the enzyme's active —SH. The rapid rate of inactivation by l-PACK compared to d-PACK and PBCK implies that l-PACK, by virtue of its structural similarity to transglutaminase substrates, is properly oriented at the substrate-binding site of enzyme prior to the covalent reaction. The pKa of the phenolic group in the acyl protion of each of these inactivators is shifted towards that of a weaker acid in the reporter-labeled enzyme proteins. The identical changes in pKa with each inactivator suggest that the phenylacetyl side chain in each case is positioned in the same manner within the matrix of the calcium-activated enzyme derivative. Addition of EDTA results in a shift in pKa of the phenolic group in each enzyme derivative back to that of the parent inactivator. This, together with the findings with BHNA, forms the basis for a suggestion that the active —SH is located at or near the surface in the unactivated enzyme, i.e., in the absence of Ca++. Active site titration procedures for transglutaminase are described. A rate assay procedure utilizing either BHNA or l-PACK was found to give results in excellent agreement with those of a direct spectrophotometric method carried out with the use of BHNA. The latter titration is based on the differences in the absorption spectrum of the phenacyl group bound to the enzyme's active —SH and that of this group attached to other positions on the enzyme molecule."

https://openalex.org/W1560853121,"Abstract The serological activity of the S-100 protein from bovine brain is reduced if the protein is aggregated by disulfide bond formation, the sulfhydryl groups are blocked by p-mercuribenzoate, or the activity is destroyed by incubation at high temperatures. Chelating agents, which bind metals that can oxidize sulfhydryl groups, protect the serological activity from heat denaturation. Blocking the sulfhydryl groups with p-mercuribenzoate stabilizes the reduced serological activity to further inactivation by heat. The serological activity, whether reduced or destroyed, can be recovered in all cases by incubation with 2-mercaptoethanol at 60°. The serological activity of S-100 from extracts of different portions of the brain is not the same, but incubation with 2-mercaptoethanol abolishes the differences."

After repeated injections progressively higher doses of morphine were needed to depress responding. Also, dependence could be demonstrated in these animals by precipitating specific abstinence signs with an antagonist."
https://openalex.org/W1558386586,"Abstract As shown previously by J. A. Verpoorte and C. Lindblow (J. Biol. Chem., 243, 5993 (1968)) 3 of the 8 tyrosine residues in human carbonic anhydrase B can be nitrated with tetranitromethane. The present studies involve separation of tryptic peptides from the nitrated protein, with sequence determinations to locate the positions of the nitrated residues in the total sequence of the protein. The most rapidly nitrated residue is at position 20 from the amino-terminal end; another that reacts more slowly is in the region of still undetermined total sequence (residues 92 to 152 inclusive) and a third, at position 88, reacts still more slowly. No evidence was found for reactivity of the 5 other tyrosine residues, two of which are at positions 7 and 51, one is in the undetermined region, and two are in the carboxy-terminal half of the molecule. Great difficulty was initially found in separating the peptides containing nitrated tyrosine residues from other peptides in the tryptic hydrolysate. This difficulty, probably due primarily to aggregation, was overcome by adding sodium dodecyl sulfate before fractionations of the peptides on Sephadex G-50 and then on G-25. Subsequent chromatography removed the detergent and effected final purification. The procedure may prove useful in other cases where separation of peptides is difficult."

https://openalex.org/W1574163594,"Abstract The kinetics of acceptance of 20 amino acids by Escherichia coli tRNA was examined after heat treatment with and without magnesium. Beside tRNAtrp, those tRNAs specific for histidine and glutamic acid showed a partial loss of amino acid acceptor activity when heated without magnesium. No loss of activity was observed in the tRNAs of the remaining 17 amino acids. Also examined was tRNAtrp from various bacterial species whose DNA composition ranged from 35 to 72% in their guanine-cytosine content. Five of the nine species of bacteria showed the interconversion of tRNAtrp and the remaining four existed only in the active form."
https://openalex.org/W1591320443,"Abstract The Fab'µ fragments of the nitrophenyl-binding human Waldenstrom macroglobulin, γMwag, were nitrated with tetranitromethane. At low levels of nitration there was stoichiometric inactivation of the combining sites. Inactivation was substantially reduced when site-saturating concentrations of a ligand were present during the nitration. The nitrotyrosine (or nitrotyrosines) formed during the inactivation had distinctive spectral properties, suggesting that they are located in a hydrophobic milieu. We propose that this may explain the unusual susceptibility of certain tyrosines to modification by tetranitromethane. The critical tyrosine (or tyrosines) appear to be predominantly on the Fd' fragment."
https://openalex.org/W1510639865,"Abstract Evidence is provided that Tetrahymena pyriformis is capable of converting 5α-cholest-7-en-3β-ol, 5α-cholestan-3β-ol, and cholest-5,24-dien-3β-ol (desmosterol) to products having a 5,7,22-triene system. In the case of desmosterol the C-24 double bond is largely retained. Studies with [6α-3H]- and [6β-3H]5α-cholest-7-en-3β-ol indicate that the introduction of the 5 double bond in these compounds proceeds with the abstraction of the 5α- and 6α-hydrogens. The 6β-tritium atom is completely retained. The introduction of the 5,6 double bond is accompanied by a considerable isotope effect. This is in contrast to the previously reported observations that the introduction of the 7 and 22 double bonds does not involve an isotope effect."
