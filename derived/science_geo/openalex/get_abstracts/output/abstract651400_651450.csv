https://openalex.org/W3020597141,"A close-up view of the retrotranslocon Misfolded endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteins are retrotranslocated into the cytosol, polyubiquitinated, and degraded by the proteasome in a process known as ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD). ERAD of misfolded luminal ER proteins (ERAD-L) is mediated by the Hrd1 complex, composed of the ubiquitin ligase Hrd1 and four additional proteins (Hrd3, Der1, Usa1, and Yos9). Wu et al. report a cryo–electron microscopy structure of the active Hrd1 complex from yeast and, based on this structure, developed a model for how substrates are recognized and retrotranslocated. They propose that Hrd3 and Yos9 jointly create a luminal binding site for misfolded glycoproteins. Hrd1 and Der1 form “half-channels” juxtaposed in a thinned section of the ER membrane, which allows a polypeptide loop of an ERAD-L substrate to move through it. Science , this issue p. eaaz2449"

Although previous studies have demonstrated that the pro-angiogenic phase of wound healing is blunted in diabetes, a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms that regulate skin revascularization and capillary stabilization in diabetic wounds is lacking. Using a mouse model of diabetic wound healing, we performed microCT analysis of the 3-dimensional architecture of the capillary bed. As compared to wild type, vessel surface area, branch junction number, total vessel length, and total branch number were significantly decreased in wounds of diabetic mice as compared to WT mice. Diabetic mouse wounds also had significantly increased capillary permeability and decreased pericyte coverage of capillaries. Diabetic wounds exhibited significant perturbations in the expression of factors that affect vascular regrowth, maturation and stability. Specifically, the expression of VEGF-A, Sprouty2, PEDF, LRP6, Thrombospondin 1, CXCL10, CXCR3, PDGFR-β, HB-EGF, EGFR, TGF-β1, Semaphorin3a, Neuropilin 1, angiopoietin 2, NG2, and RGS5 were down-regulated in diabetic wounds. Together, these studies provide novel information about the complexity of the perturbation of angiogenesis in diabetic wounds. Targeting factors responsible for wound resolution and vascular pruning, as well those that affect pericyte recruitment, maturation, and stability may have the potential to improve diabetic skin wound healing."

The effects of digitalisation on the economy, society and quality of life imply significant challenges of the labour market. All the participants will be concerned: authorities, companies and ordinary people. The objective of this research is to analyse the perceptions of the EU citizens about digitalisation and to highlight the differences among specific socio-demographic groups. The analysis is grounded on a composite methodology, comprising several statistical and econometric methods that provide scientific support to achieved conclusions: statistical analysis (with the primary goal to shed light on the EU citizens' perceptions about their digital technology skills), TwoStep Cluster Analysis (TSCA) (with the purpose to identify the ‘digital vulnerable groups’ and then the ‘digital vulnerable countries’ in terms of the exposure to digital divide) and logistic regression (with the main aim to quantify the impact of the relevant factors on citizens’ perceptions about digitalisation). We identified a group of respondents evaluating themselves as having meagre digital skills, very afraid that robots could steal their jobs and with low usage of the internet. They are elderly, with a low level of education, manual workers or not working, with a relatively low level of income and little Internet use. The originality of our approach is given by the fact that we focused on investigating if digital divide leads to the creation of vulnerable groups (citizens and/or countries) and if there are specific patterns in terms of the perception on being skilled in the use of digital technologies in daily life or at work and of the understanding that robots replace human on the labour market. We aim to find relevant factors for the labour market to assume targeted measures that should be taken for a better match of supply and demand on the labour market and for creating a smart labour market. It is highly needed to increase the people's confidence in their skills level and to make the most of digitalisation of the societies. The results show consistent patterns in term of socio-demographic characteristics and perception towards digitalisation. The latter will have a meaningful impact on the economy and the society in the European Union in the next period. That is why a positive attitude towards digitalisation is essential for transforming this relatively new challenge into an excellent opportunity for the future."
https://openalex.org/W3018964764,"Introduction Tuberculosis (TB) remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in Vietnam. The current TB burden is unknown as not all individuals with TB are diagnosed, recorded and notified. The second national TB prevalence survey was conducted in 2017–2018 to assess the current burden of TB disease in the country. Method Eighty-two clusters were selected using a multistage cluster sampling design. Adult (≥15 years of age) residents having lived for 2 weeks or more in the households of the selected clusters were invited to participate in the survey. The survey participants were screened for TB by a questionnaire and digital chest X-ray after providing written informed consent. Individuals with a positive symptom screen and/or chest X-ray suggestive of TB were asked to provide sputum samples to test for Mycobacterium tuberculosis by Ziehl-Neelsen direct light microscopy, Xpert MTB/RIF G4, BACTEC MGIT960 liquid culture and Löwenstein-Jensen solid culture. Bacteriologically confirmed TB cases were defined by an expert panel following a standard decision tree. Result Of 87,207 eligible residents, 61,763 (70.8%) participated, and 4,738 (7.7%) screened positive for TB. Among these, 221 participants were defined as bacteriologically confirmed TB cases. The estimated prevalence of bacteriologically confirmed adult pulmonary TB was 322 (95% CI: 260–399) per 100,000, and the male-to-female ratio was 4.0 (2.8–5.8, p<0.001). In-depth interviews with the participants with TB disease showed that only 57.9% (95% CI: 51.3–64.3%) reported cough for 2 weeks or more and 32.1% (26.3–38.6%) did not report any symptom consistent with TB, while their chest X-ray results showed that 97.7% (95% CI: 94.6–99.1) had abnormal chest X-ray images suggesting TB. Conclusion With highly sensitive diagnostics applied, this survey showed that the TB burden in Vietnam remains high. Half of the TB cases were not picked up by general symptom-based screening and were identified by chest X-ray only. Our results indicate that improving TB diagnostic capacity and access to care, along with reducing TB stigma, need to be top priorities for TB control and elimination in Vietnam."

We have previously demonstrated that sphingosine is present in nasal, tracheal, and bronchial epithelial cells and constitutes a central element of the defense of the airways against bacterial pathogens. Here, using assorted lipid-binding and cell biology assays, we demonstrate that exposing P. aeruginosa and S. aureus cells to sphingosine results in a very rapid, i.e. within minutes, permeabilization of the bacterial plasma membrane, resulting in leakiness of the bacterial cells, loss of ATP, and loss of bacterial metabolic activity. These alterations rapidly induced bacterial death. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that the presence of the protonated NH2 group in sphingosine, which is an amino-alcohol, is required for sphingosine's bactericidal activity. We also show that the protonated NH2 group of sphingosine binds to the highly negatively–charged lipid cardiolipin in bacterial plasma membranes. Of note, this binding was required for bacterial killing by sphingosine, as revealed by genetic experiments indicating that E. coli or P. aeruginosa strains that lack cardiolipin synthase are resistant to sphingosine, both in vitro and in vivo. We propose that binding of sphingosine to cardiolipin clusters cardiolipin molecules in the plasma membrane of bacteria. This clustering results in the formation of gel-like or even crystal-like structures in the bacterial plasma membrane and thereby promotes rapid permeabilization of the plasma membrane and bacterial cell death.

Approximately 80% of all CF patients are colonized with P. aeruginosa by the age of 25. At present, no treatment to eradicate these bacterial infections is available. Many P. aeruginosa and S. aureus strains are highly resistant to existing antibiotics, and attempts to eradicate pulmonary P. aeruginosa or S. aureus among CF or COPD patients usually fail. Thus, it is important to develop novel strategies for treating pulmonary infections with P. aeruginosa and S. aureus. Sphingolipids are a class of lipids that share an amino alcohol (sphingoid base) backbone. We have previously demonstrated that sphingosine efficiently kills many bacterial species in vitro and in vivo, including P. aeruginosa, S. aureus (even methicillin-resistant S. aureus), Acinetobacter baumannii, Haemophilus influenzae, Burkholderia cepacia, and Moraxella catarrhalis (12Pewzner-Jung Y.

These studies demonstrate a central role of sphingosine in the defense against bacterial pathogens in pulmonary infections. EM studies by Fischer et al. (15Fischer C.L. Walters K.S. Drake D.R.

Physiol. 2013; 26 (23128426): 36-4410.1159/000343175Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) indicated that killing of pathogens by sphingosine does not result in simple lysis of pathogens such as Gram-positive S. aureus and Gram-negative E. coli. These studies clearly indicate that sphingosine is bactericidal for a variety of pathogens, but the molecular mechanisms of sphingosine-mediated killing of bacteria remain to be defined. Here, we demonstrate that sphingosine binds to cardiolipin in the bacterial plasma membrane resulting in rapid permeabilization of the bacterial membrane and death. Bacterial mutants that lack cardiolipin are resistant to sphingosine-mediated toxicity in vitro and in vivo. Thus, the interaction of sphingosine with cardiolipin is required for its bactericidal effects. Sphingosine most likely acts by inducing very rigid cardiolipin–membrane domains, a process that results in leakiness of the membrane and bacterial death. This notion is consistent with biophysical experiments measuring membrane fluidity in liposomes after treatment with sphingosine. To define molecular mechanisms that mediate the bactericidal effects of sphingosine, we incubated two P. aeruginosa strains, i.e. the clinical isolate 762 and the laboratory strain American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) 27853, and a clinical isolate of S. aureus, named DH, with 1 or 10 μm sphingosine or the corresponding concentrations of octylglucopyranoside, the detergent used to solubilize sphingosine. The bacteria were incubated with sphingosine for 5 min. We then determined the membrane permeability of the bacteria by staining with TO-PROTM-3 iodide. Viable cells are impermeable to TO-PRO-3, which binds to chromosomes after an increase in membrane permeability. This can be visualized by fluorescence microscopy or flow cytometry. The data show that incubation of P. aeruginosa or S. aureus with sphingosine results in a rapid increase in bacterial permeability (Fig. 1, A and B). An additional time-course study showed that sphingosine mediates almost complete cell permeability already within 5 min, resulting in increased staining of the bacteria with TO-PRO-3 (data not shown). To confirm the rapid effect of sphingosine on the viability of bacteria, we determined the release of ATP into the medium upon incubation of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus with sphingosine. The results showed a rapid release of ATP into the medium (Fig. 1, C and D). In accordance with the massive increase of membrane permeability upon incubation of the bacteria with sphingosine, we also observed a dramatic decrease in metabolic activity in P. aeruginosa or S. aureus upon incubation with sphingosine (Fig. 2). Next, we aimed to further define the time course of sphingosine-mediated killing of P. aeruginosa. To this end, we incubated the P. aeruginosa strains 762 or ATCC 27853 with 1 or 10 μm sphingosine for 15 or 60 min, washed, and re-cultured the bacteria. The results of these studies demonstrate that sphingosine killed the bacteria within 15 min (Fig. 3), a finding consistent with the very rapid action of sphingosine on membrane integrity/permeability. Sphingosine contains an NH2 group and an OH group. At neutral or slightly acidic pH, as found in airways and on many epithelial cell surfaces (19Muraglia K.A. Chorghade R.S. Kim B.R. Tang X.X. Shah V.S. Grillo A.S. Daniels P.N. Cioffi A.G. Karp P.H. Zhu L. Welsh M.J. Burke M.D. Small-molecule ion channels increase host defences in cystic fibrosis airway epithelia.Nature. 2019; 567 (30867598): 405-40810.1038/s41586-019-1018-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), the NH2 group will be protonated and thus positively charged. Therefore, we first tested whether the NH2 group is important, and second whether protonation of this group is required for the bactericidal effects of sphingosine. First, to test whether the amine group mediates the bactericidal effects of sphingosine, we incubated P. aeruginosa with 1 or 10 μm stearylamine, which is structurally very similar to sphingosine but lacks the OH group. The results showed that stearylamine kills P. aeruginosa as efficiently as sphingosine (Fig. 4A). Second, to test whether the pH determines the effects of sphingosine on P. aeruginosa, we measured whether an increase of the pH from 6.0 to 8.0 alters the bactericidal effects of sphingosine. The results show that the effects of sphingosine on P. aeruginosa are greatly reduced at pH 8.0 (Fig. 4B). This finding indicates that protonation of the NH2 group is necessary for the antibacterial effects of sphingosine. To further confirm the notion of an interaction of sphingosine with cardiolipin, we tested whether sphingosine induces a release of cytochrome c from isolated mitochondria. The data (Fig. 4C) show that sphingosine induces a release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, which is prevented by alkalization of the samples. Given (i) the structure of sphingosine, which is an amino alcohol, (ii) the obvious significance of the NH2 group for sphingosine-mediated killing of bacteria, and (iii) the observation that bacteria are much more sensitive to sphingosine than mammalian cells (12Pewzner-Jung Y.

One candidate meeting the characteristics of such a molecule is cardiolipin, a negatively-charged lipid that is very important for respiration. Cardiolipin is present in the plasma membrane of bacteria, but it is absent from the plasma membrane of mammalian cells, in which it is present exclusively in mitochondrial membranes (consistent with the endosymbiont hypothesis). To test this hypothesis, we determined whether sphingosine binds to cardiolipin in vitro. To this end, we co-incubated cardiolipin that was immobilized to agarose beads with soluble sphingosine and determined the binding of sphingosine. The results of these co-precipitation experiments show that sphingosine binds cardiolipin (Fig. 5A) most efficiently at low pH. Sphingosine showed some residual binding to control lipids, i.e. phosphatidylethanolamine or phosphatidylcholine, which was removed by addition of 0.1% NP-40 to reduce hydrophobic interactions between the acyl chains (Fig. 5A). Next, we incubated sphingosine immobilized to beads with soluble cardiolipin. The results confirm the interaction of sphingosine with cardiolipin (Fig. 5B). The binding of sphingosine to cardiolipin depends on the pH and is maximal at pH 6.0 and greatly reduced at pH 8.0. This supports the notion that protonation of the NH2 group in sphingosine is required for binding to cardiolipin. The binding assays show an almost quantitative binding of the two lipids at low or physiological pH indicating a strong binding affinity (Fig. 5, A and B). To gain insight into potential mechanisms of how sphingosine kills bacteria upon binding to cardiolipin, we generated cardiolipin-containing liposomes and tested binding of sphingosine. These studies demonstrate that cardiolipin-containing liposomes bind sphingosine. Binding of sphingosine to cardiolipin results in a marked decrease of membrane fluidity (Fig. 5C). This is consistent with the hypothesis that sphingosine induces rigid, gel-like cardiolipin-enriched domains in bacteria in vivo. To demonstrate the role of cardiolipin in sphingosine-mediated killing of bacteria, we used an E. coli strain that lacks cardiolipin synthase A. Although E. coli expresses three cardiolipin synthases, only cardiolipin synthase A is expressed under logarithmic growth conditions (20Tan B.K. Bogdanov M. Zhao J. Dowhan W. Raetz C.R. Guan Z. Discovery of a cardiolipin synthase utilizing phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylglycerol as substrates.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109 (22988102): 16504-1650910.1073/pnas.1212797109Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The results show that the E. coli strain lacking cardiolipin synthase A is almost completely resistant to sphingosine, whereas the WT strain is rapidly killed (Fig. 6A). These studies were recapitulated with two transposon mutants of P. aeruginosa strain PAO-1 that also lack cardiolipin synthase. These strains were resistant to sphingosine-mediated killing in vitro (Fig. 6B). We also infected mice deficient for Cftr (22Teichgräber V. Ulrich M. Endlich N. Riethmüller J. Wilker B.

Med. 2008; 14 (18376404): 382-39110.1038/nm1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar) with the WT and the two mutant P. aeruginosa strains and determined the effect of an inhalation of sphingosine on pulmonary P. aeruginosa counts. These studies reveal that the cardiolipin synthase-deficient P. aeruginosa strains are resistant to sphingosine inhalation, whereas the parental strain was killed by inhalation of sphingosine (Fig. 6, C and D). In addition, we wanted to exclude the possibility that sphingosine kills bacteria by interfering with the respiratory process only. Therefore, we tested sphingosine efficiency under hypoxic conditions. Hypoxia reduced but did not abrogate the bactericidal effects of sphingosine on P. aeruginosa (Fig. 6E). Our studies demonstrate that sphingosine induces a very rapid death of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus that is obviously caused by a massive increase of membrane permeability, loss of important metabolites such as ATP, and a loss of metabolic activity. These findings are consistent with a previous study that showed rapid membrane permeabilization of S. aureus upon incubation with certain fatty acids (23Parsons J.B. Yao J. Frank M.W. Jackson P. Rock C.O. Membrane disruption by antimicrobial fatty acids releases low-molecular-weight proteins from Staphylococcus aureus.J. Bacteriol. 2012; 194 (22843840): 5294-530410.1128/JB.00743-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This study also tested the effects of sphingosine, which is not a fatty acid but rather a sphingoid base, on bacterial killing and reported a minimal inhibitory concentration of 7.8 μm for sphingosine (23Parsons J.B. Yao J. Frank M.W. Jackson P. Rock C.O. Membrane disruption by antimicrobial fatty acids releases low-molecular-weight proteins from Staphylococcus aureus.J. Bacteriol. 2012; 194 (22843840): 5294-530410.1128/JB.00743-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), which is very similar to the observations in this study. However, the molecular mechanism of sphingosine-mediated killing of bacteria was not addressed in this study. Additional EM studies demonstrated that incubation of S. aureus and E. coli with 5 μm sphingosine induces a disruption and even loss of the cell wall of S. aureus (15Fischer C.L. Walters K.S. Drake D.R. Blanchette D.R. Dawson D.V. Brogden K.A. Wertz P.W. Sphingoid bases are taken up by Escherichia coliStaphylococcus aureus and induce ultrastructural damage.Skin Pharmacol. Physiol. 2013; 26 (23128426): 36-4410.1159/000343175Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In contrast, the cytoplasmic membrane and the outer envelope in Gram-negative E. coli appeared to be intact after sphingosine incubation. This indicates that sphingosine does not simply lyse bacteria, in accordance with the conclusions of this study. Here, we demonstrate that the NH2 group in sphingosine is critical for mediating bacterial killing and that sphingosine is inactive at alkaline pH. This strongly suggests that the NH2 group of sphingosines must be protonated to mediate killing of pathogens. We have previously shown that sphingosine is mainly present on the surface of epithelial cells in the nose, trachea, and bronchi (12Pewzner-Jung Y. Tavakoli Tabazavareh S. Grassmé H. Becker K.A.

Thus, sphingosine will be protonated in its natural environment. These findings led us to speculate that sphingosine binds to negatively-charged lipids in the plasma membrane of bacteria.

Thirty professional soccer players (age: 26.57±5.56 years) were tracked during the 2017–2018 season during friendly, national and international matches (38 total games) using inertial measurement devices. CentF and COD were the variables extracted for analysis. A one-way ANOVA was used for playing position comparison, a t-test for laterality and field zone, and Pearson’s correlation coefficient to analyze relationships between anthropometric characteristics and dependent variables. There were differences by playing position in COD (556.33-to-412.18), R20COD (484.36-to-354.81) and R60COD (48.38-to-38.61) (p < .01; ωp2 = 0.03-to-0.05; CD>CM>LD>LM = FW); in CODHIA (49.75-to-37.11), R20CODHIA (16.04-to-9.11) and R60CODHIA (10.64-to-9.11) (p < .01; ωp2 = 0.03-to-0.07; CM>FW>LM>CD = LD); in CODSPRINT (14.56-to-8.40) and R20CODSPRINT (3.29-to-1.40) (p < .01; ωp2 = 0.03-to-0.04; FW = LM = CM>CD = LD); and in CentFMAX both in clockwise (992.04-to-902.09N) and counterclockwise (999.24-to-872.61N) directions (p < .02; ωp2 = 0.02-to-0.07; FW = CD>CM = LM = LD). The highest values of counterclockwise CentF were performed by left-footed players in the central zone (p < .001; d = 0.71-to-1.44) and clockwise CentF by right-footed players (p < .001; d = 0.04-to-0.55) in the lateral field zone. Moderate correlations were found between age, body mass and high intensity/sprints COD and repeated COD ability (p < .05; r = 0.235-to-0.383). Therefore, team staff should consider anthropometric characteristics, playing position, laterality and field zone to individualize training workload related to non-linear locomotion in soccer."

The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a major site of the synthesis of proteins that are critical for proper function of the heart, including many calcium-handling proteins, receptors, and secreted proteins, such as hormones, stem cell homing factors, and growth factors (1Glembotski C.C. Roles for the sarco-/endoplasmic reticulum in cardiac myocyte contraction, protein synthesis, and protein quality control.Physiology. 2012; 27 (23223628): 343-35010.1152/physiol.00034.2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 2Gidalevitz T.

Therefore, proper folding of proteins synthesized in the ER of cardiac myocytes is essential for maintaining optimal cardiac function. Furthermore, many post-translational modifications occur in the ER, including disulfide bond formation, which are critical for protein stability and function (3Thuerauf D.J. Marcinko M. Gude N.

Subsequently, it was demonstrated in cultured cardiac myocytes and in mouse hearts, in vivo, that I/R disrupts protein folding in the ER, leading to activation of the ER stress response, also called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (3Thuerauf D.J.

The UPR is controlled in all mammalian cells by several ER-transmembrane sensors of ER protein misfolding, including the adaptive transcription factor, ATF6 (8Zhu C. Johansen F.E. Prywes R.

When protein synthesis surpasses the capacity of the protein-folding machinery, increases in misfolded proteins cause the translocation of the ER-transmembrane, 90-kDa form of ATF6 to the Golgi, where it is clipped, liberating an N-terminal fragment that, after nuclear translocation, serves as a transcription factor. This 50-kDa active form of ATF6 regulates a gene program that is responsible for the expression of numerous proteins that enhance ER protein folding, which adaptively restores the balance between protein synthesis and folding (8Zhu C. Johansen F.E. Prywes R. Interaction of ATF6 and serum response factor.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17 (9271374): 4957-496610.1128/MCB.17.9.4957Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 9Haze K.

We previously generated a transgenic mouse line in which ATF6 could be activated at will, selectively in cardiac myocytes; using this mouse line, we showed that ATF6 protected hearts from I/R damage (10Martindale J.J.

One of those genes encodes mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF), which was originally isolated from astrocytes (13Petrova P. Raibekas A. Pevsner J. Vigo N. Anafi M. Moore M.K.

One of the striking features of MANF is that it has a noncanonical but functional ER retention sequence at the C terminus but otherwise shares little structural homology with other proteins (14Glembotski C.C. Functions for the cardiomyokine, MANF, in cardioprotection, hypertrophy and heart failure.J. Mol.

This finding spawned our hypothesis that MANF exerts a unique function within the ER to maintain ER protein folding and prevent myocyte death during I/R; however, such a concept has not been studied. Accordingly, here we examined the function of MANF in the ER of cardiac myocytes. We found that, in cardiac myocytes, MANF is protective under specific forms of pharmacological and pathophysiological ER stress and that MANF exerts its protective effects by enhancing ER protein folding, thus maintaining ER proteostasis. Mechanistically, we showed that MANF exerts this effect, at least partly, by virtue of its ability to serve as a chaperone. This finding was unexpected, because MANF does not share significant structural features with other chaperones. Further studies demonstrated that the eight cysteine residues within the 158-aa MANF structure, whose positions are conserved among all species of MANF examined to date, are critical for its chaperone function, mainly under reductive ER stress, consistent with the importance of disulfide bond formation in ER protein folding. This study establishes a new protective role for MANF in the ER of cardiac myocytes in the heart and provides evidence that MANF mediates protection and enhances ER protein folding selectively during reductive ER stress. To determine the effects of MANF loss of function in the heart, we generated a mouse model in which the α-MHC promoter drives expression of a Manf-specific microRNA in a cardiac myocyte–restricted manner. We elected to knock down endogenous MANF instead of completely deleting it because the deletion of many ER stress response genes has been shown to lead to embryonic lethality (16Doroudgar S.

Immunoblotting of mouse hearts showed that, compared with WT mice, MANF knockdown (KD) mice exhibited a 4-fold reduction in MANF (Fig. 1, A and B). As the effects of MANF knockdown on mouse heart function have not been previously examined, basal cardiac function was assessed by echocardiography. Compared with WT mouse hearts, MANF KD mice exhibited increased ejection fraction; MANF KD female mice had slightly decreased left ventricular systolic volume, whereas male MANF KD mice had slightly increased left ventricular diastolic volume (Table 1). To assess whether the increase in cardiac contractility elicited cardiac pathology, mRNA levels of cardiac pathology markers Nppa, Nppb, and Col1a1 and protein levels of ER stress markers (i.e. GRP94 and GRP78) as well as hearts and lung weights from WT and MANF KD mice were measured. Expression of ER stress and cardiac pathology markers (Fig. 1 (A and C–G)) and heart and lung weights (Fig. 1, H–J) were unaffected by MANF knockdown. Overall, these results show that knocking down MANF in cardiac myocytes of mouse hearts by ∼80% increases contractility but does not induce any overt cardiac pathology. Because no overt cardiac pathology was observed, we moved forward to study the effects of MANF knockdown in pathophysiological models of ER stress.Table 1Echocardiographic parameters of WT and transgenic (MANF KD) miceParameterFemale WT (n = 6)Female MANF KD (n = 7)Male WT (n = 6)Male MANF KD (n = 7)FS (%)39.80 ± 3.1150.47 ± 0.75*36.89 ± 1.8745.96 ± 1.72*EF (%)70.61 ± 2.7282.62 ± 0.74*67.91 ± 2.3577.82 ± 1.83*LVEDV (μl)53.17 ± 2.3749.82 ± 3.2541.83 ± 3.0256.93 ± 3.86*LVESV (μl)15.97 ± 2.188.74 ± 0.87*13.18 ± 0.7212.99 ± 1.94LVIDD (mm)3.58 ± 0.093.40 ± 0.063.22 ± 0.103.66 ± 0.10LVIDS (mm)2.10 ± 0.141.65 ± 0.11*2.02 ± 0.041.98 ± 0.11PWTD (mm)0.89 ± 0.050.77 ± 0.060.92 ± 0.071.05 ± 0.14PWTS (mm)1.15 ± 0.061.32 ± 0.081.25 ± 0.121.45 ± 0.07AWTD (mm)0.85 ± 0.060.95 ± 0.111.03 ± 0.070.94 ± 0.04AWTS (mm)1.45 ± 0.071.58 ± 0.061.43 ± 0.071.56 ± 0.08LV mass (mg)99.16 ± 8.2292.65 ± 7.72106.75 ± 6.94124.01 ± 14.04HR (bpm)472.96 ± 2.98458.69 ± 5.51473.88 ± 11.14453.20 ± 4.58 Open table in a new tab To determine the consequences of MANF knockdown on myocyte viability during conditions known to induce ER stress, adult mouse ventricular myocytes (AMVMs) were isolated from WT and MANF KD mice and subjected to simulated ischemia/reperfusion (sI/R), a model of pathophysiological ER stress. Compared with WT myocytes, MANF KD myocytes exhibited more death in response to sI/R (Fig. 1K). To examine functional roles for MANF in the heart, WT and MANF KD mouse hearts were subjected to ex vivo I/R (17Morrison L.E. Whittaker R.J. Klepper R.E. Wawrousek E.F. Glembotski C.C.

Compared with WT mouse hearts, MANF KD mouse hearts exhibited significantly lower functional recovery, significantly increased tissue damage, and greater LDH release, the last of which is an indicator of necrotic tissue damage (Fig. 1, L–P) (10Martindale J.J.

These results indicate that MANF knockdown in the heart decreases myocyte viability during I/R, resulting in increased tissue damage and decreased cardiac function. To determine whether ectopic expression of FLAG-MANF could restore the functional and structural defects observed in the MANF KD mice, we engineered a recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) (5Jin J.K.

We found that the hearts of MANF KD mice that were treated with AAV9-FLAG-MANF had about the same level of MANF as WT hearts (Fig. 2A). When hearts were subjected to ex vivo I/R, compared with AAV9-Con–treated mice, AAV9-FLAG-MANF–treated mice exhibited smaller infarcts, greater contractile function, and less necrosis (Fig. 2, B–F). In fact, the AAV9-FLAG-MANF completely restored these cardiac parameters to those seen in WT mice. Thus, it is the depletion of endogenous MANF in the MANF KD mouse hearts that results in their greater I/R injury and decreased cardiac function. Myocyte death can occur during ischemia as well as reperfusion. To determine whether MANF could provide protection under one or both of these conditions, we examined MANF levels in cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs) subjected to sI or sI/R. MANF levels increased upon sI and further upon sI/R, suggesting that MANF could contribute to preserving myocyte viability under either or both conditions (Fig. 3A). To further examine functional roles for MANF, it was knocked down using siRNA (Fig. 3B); we found that MANF knockdown had no effect on cell death during sI (Fig. 3C); however, MANF knockdown increased cell death during reperfusion, as indicated by the increased number of propidium iodide (PI)-positive cells and release of HMGB1 into the culture medium during reperfusion (Fig. 3, D, E (top), and F). Because cell death in cardiac myocytes can be caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated during reperfusion injury (5Jin J.K. Blackwood E.A. Azizi K. Thuerauf D.J. Fahem A.G. Hofmann C.

Because ROS increased when MANF was knocked down in sI/R-treated NRVMs, and because accumulation of cellular ROS can result in ER stress (19Malhotra J.D. Kaufman R.J. Endoplasmic reticulum stress and oxidative stress: a vicious cycle or a double-edged sword?.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2007; 9 (17979528): 2277-229310.1089/ars.2007.1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar), we investigated whether MANF knockdown increased indicators of ER protein misfolding during sI/R. One way to measure ER protein-folding status is to examine the levels of ER chaperones, which are known to increase when ER protein folding is impaired. Indeed, MANF knockdown impaired ER protein folding during sI/R, as evidenced by increased expression of GRP94, GRP78, and PDIA6 (Fig. 3, E (bottom) and H). Thus, endogenous MANF enhances myocyte viability, at least partly by contributing to maintaining ER protein folding during sI/R. Because the increase in ROS upon MANF knockdown might be responsible for increases in protein misfolding and decreases in myocyte viability during sI/R, we examined the effects of MANF knockdown on cell viability in NRVMs treated with the ROS generator, H2O2 (5Jin J.K.

Whereas MANF knockdown and H2O2 each decreased myocyte viability, when examined together, their effects were approximately additive (Fig. 4A), suggesting that MANF does not directly protect against protein misfolding caused by ROS. The probable independence of the effects of MANF knockdown and H2O2 on NRVM viability was further supported by a two-way ANOVA, which statistically demonstrated that MANF knockdown and H2O2 independently affected viability. Because MANF-mediated protection of myocytes did not appear to involve mitigating the effects of ROS generated during reperfusion, we examined whether MANF could protect myocytes against other types of ER protein misfolding that occur during I/R injury. Whereas ROS generated during I/R can result in protein misfolding, protein misfolding can also be caused by impaired disulfide bond formation. Disulfide bonds, formed in nascent ER proteins, are dependent on the presence of oxygen and the optimal redox environment of the ER, which is likely to shift toward a reductive environment during reperfusion, as the ER redox machinery needs time to recover during oxygen reintroduction, much like how mitochondria need time to recover (6Koritzinsky M.

https://openalex.org/W3019431792,"Introduction Recent studies noted that Henoch-Schönlein purpura nephritis (HSPN) and IgA nephropathy (IgAN) share the feature of galactose-deficient IgA1 (Gd-IgA1)-oriented pathogenesis, although there are distinct clinical differences. We aimed to clarify the clinicopathologic differences between these 2 diseases. Methods We cross-sectionally analyzed adult patients with HSPN (n = 24) or IgAN (n = 56) who underwent renal biopsy (RB) between 2008 and 2018 at Showa University Hospital. Serum Gd-IgA1 (s-Gd-IgA1) levels at the time of RB were compared among study groups using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with anti-human Gd-IgA1-specific monoclonal antibody (KM55). We also immunohistochemically stained paraffin-embedded sections for glomerular Gd-IgA1 (g-Gd-IgA1)-deposition using KM55. Serum inflammatory cytokines were measured using ELISA. Results Glomerular endothelial injury with subendothelial IgA deposition was significant in patients with HSPN. Serum IL-8, MCP-1, TNF-α, and IL-6 levels were significantly higher in patients with HSPN than IgAN. Levels of s-Gd-IgA1 were comparable among patients with HSPN and IgAN, and a similar degree of g-Gd-IgA1-deposition was detected in both diseases. Furthermore, g-Gd-IgA1-deposition was evident in patients with histopathologically advanced HSPN or IgAN. In HSPN, significant positive correlations between s-Gd-IgA1 levels and crescent formation or IL-6 elevation were confirmed, and g-Gd-IgA1 intensity showed a significant positive correlation with MCP-1 and a tendency to positively correlate with IL-8. Meanwhile, patients with IgAN showed no correlation between inflammatory cytokines and both-Gd-IgA1. Moreover, most g-Gd-IgA1-positive areas were not double stained with CD31 in HSPN. Conclusions Although assessing both-Gd-IgA1 alone was insufficient to distinguish between HSPN and IgAN, patients with HSPN showed considerable glomerular capillaritis with subendothelial IgA deposition and significant elevation of serum inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, such glomerular subendothelial IgA deposition might not contain Gd-IgA1, and factors associated with Gd-IgA1 were inconsistent among these 2 diseases. Thus, developmental mechanisms for IgAN might not apply to HSPN completely, and these 2 diseases still have different aspects."
https://openalex.org/W3017742947,"Background In the past decade, hundreds of new psychoactive substances (NPS) have been introduced as unclassified alternatives to the illicit drugs. The NPS represent a growing health concern by causing adverse effects and deaths but are usually undetectable by conventional drug tests. This report summarizes results and experiences from analytically confirmed drug-related acute intoxications in emergency departments (ED) and intensive care units (ICU) enrolled in the Swedish STRIDA project on NPS in 2010–2016. Methods and findings ED/ICU intoxications suspected to involve NPS were enrolled in the project, after initial contact with the Poisons Information Centre (PIC). Serum/plasma and urine samples, and sometimes drug products, were subjected to a comprehensive toxicological investigation, and the PIC retrieved information on associated clinical symptoms and treatment. Between January 2010-February 2016, 2626 cases were enrolled. The patients were aged 8–71 (mean 27, median 24) years and 74% were men. Most biological samples (81%) tested positive for one, or more (70%), psychoactive drugs, including 159 NPS, other novel or uncommon substances, classical recreational and illicit drugs, and prescription medications. When first detected, most NPS or other novel substances (75%) were not banned in Sweden, but they usually disappeared upon classification, which however often took a year or longer. Some NPS were found to be especially harmful and even fatal. Conclusions The STRIDA project provided a good overview of the current drug situation in Sweden and demonstrated a widespread use and rapid turnover of many different psychoactive substances. The accomplishment of the project can be attributed to several key factors (close collaboration between the PIC and laboratory to identify suspected poisonings, free analysis, continuous updating of analytical methods, evaluation of adverse effects, and sharing information) that are useful for future activities addressing the NPS problem. The results also illustrated how drug regulations can drive the NPS market."
https://openalex.org/W3018264667,"We investigated the relationship between cognitive functioning, work performance, and sleep in non-clinical burnout. In a working population, an online survey was conducted with additional online neuropsychological tests of varying complexity, measuring attention and different components of working memory, of which the coordinating subcomponent the 'Central Executive' is thought to be the most vulnerable to stress. Results indicate that non-clinical burnout is associated with more-though not severe-sleep problems, more depressive complaints, impaired work performance, and with both subjective and objective cognitive impairments. Compared with healthy respondents (N = 107), people with non-clinical burnout (N = 17) had a significantly poorer performance on the tests of the visuospatial sketchpad and the Central Executive of the working memory. Our study also indicates that more complex tests may be more sensitive in detecting cognitive dysfunction in non-clinical burnout. Furthermore, a relationship was found between dual-task performance and work performance. Regarding to sleep quality, in our sample of people with non-clinical burnout, there were no severe sleep problems. In the entire sample, however, insomnia was significantly related to subjective, but not objective, cognitive functioning, and also not to work performance."
https://openalex.org/W3019371252,"Melatonin (MT) has many important functions in plants. In this study, different concentrations of MT (0, 50, 100, 150, and 200 μmol/L) were sprayed on grape seedlings, and its effects on plant growth and sucrose metabolism were determined. The results show that there was a mutual influence and promotional relationship between growth and sugar metabolism in grape seedlings. The MT treatments promoted the development and growth of grape seedlings by increasing their biomass and promoting the photosynthetic performance of leaves. This resulted in increased nutrient absorption and a greater ability to compete for resources. The increase in photosynthesis resulted in greater sucrose production. The MT treatments increased the activities of enzymes related to sucrose metabolism, so that a large amount of sucrose was hydrolysed into glucose and fructose to meet the rapid growth requirements of grape seedlings. The increased total soluble sugars contents and increased activities of antioxidant enzymes resulted in greater resistance of grape seedlings, and greater adaptability to environmental changes. In general, MT treatments had beneficial effects on grape seedling growth, glucose metabolism, and resistance. Under these conditions, foliar spraying with MT at 150 μmol/L had the best effects."
https://openalex.org/W3019953549,"Increased permeability of vascular lung tissues is a hallmark of acute lung injury and is often caused by edemagenic insults resulting in inflammation. Vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin undergoes internalization in response to inflammatory stimuli and is recycled at cell adhesion junctions during endothelial barrier re-establishment. Here, we hypothesized that phospholipase D (PLD)-generated phosphatidic acid (PA) signaling regulates VE-cadherin recycling and promotes endothelial barrier recovery by dephosphorylating VE-cadherin.

In human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HLMVECs), inhibition or deletion of PLD2, but not of PLD1, delayed endothelial barrier recovery after thrombin stimulation. Thrombin stimulation of HLMVECs increased co-localization of PLD2-generated PA and VE-cadherin at cell-cell adhesion junctions. Inhibition of PLD2 activity resulted in prolonged phosphorylation of Tyr-658 in VE-cadherin during the recovery phase 3 h post-thrombin challenge.

Two potential mechanisms involving VE-cadherin internalization and tyrosine phosphorylation at Tyr-685 have been implicated in barrier disruption (5Su W. Kowalczyk A.P.

However, the biological functions of PTPN14 and its target(s) remain poorly characterized. A recent study has demonstrated that the lipid second messenger, phosphatidic acid (PA), binds to PTPN14 in vitro and enhances its catalytic activity, and this interaction was implicated in mammary epithelial cell morphogenesis (24Ramesh M.

Very little is known on the role of PTPN14 in endothelial function and barrier regulation. PA is a bioactive phospholipid generated either from glycerol 3-phosphate or dihydroxyacetone phosphate during de novo biosynthesis of phospholipids (25Zegarlińska J. Piascik M. Sikorski A.F.

In this study we show for the first time that genetic deletion of PLD2 in mice exacerbates protease-activated receptor-1–activating peptide (PAR-1–AP), a peptide analog of thrombin, or lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced lung inflammation and injury in vivo and ex vivo. We provide evidence that VE-cadherin restoration at AJs and endothelial barrier recovery after stimulation by thrombin or LPS is regulated by PLD2/PA-activated PTPN14. PLD2/PA signaling facilitates recovery of thrombin- or LPS-induced endothelial permeability and VE-cadherin dephosphorylation at AJs post-thrombin challenge. Furthermore, the PA signal was found to accumulate at AJs concurrently with redistributed of VE-cadherin, and PLD2 interacted with PTPN14 and VE-cadherin during endothelial barrier recovery and restoration of AJs in response to thrombin challenge. These results demonstrate that PLD2/PA signaling is essential for proper EC barrier recovery and PTPN14 is a novel PA-regulated PTP that mediates VE-cadherin de-phosphorylation and restoration at AJs. Activation of G protein–coupled PAR-1, a G protein–coupled receptor, by thrombin or PAR-1–AP (or simply referred to as PAR1) increases endothelial permeability and leads to endothelial dysfunction (38Coughlin S.R.

However, the role of PLD1 and PLD2 in thrombin-induced lung endothelial permeability and pulmonary leak in vivo is unknown. Therefore, we examined the effect of PAR-1–AP on mouse lung permeability and vascular leak using wildtype (WT), Pld1−/−, and Pld2−/− mice. Deletion of PLD1 and PLD2 protein expression in lung tissues of Pld1 and Pld2 knockout mice, respectively, was confirmed as described (43Suryadevara V. Huang L. Kim S.-J. Cheresh P. Shaaya M.

Intratracheal administration of PAR-1–AP induced accumulation of inflammatory cells, mainly neutrophils, in lung alveolar spaces in WT, Pld1, and Pld2 knockout mice as visualized by hematoxylin and eosin staining of lung sections. However, Pld2−/− mice showed greater neutrophil accumulation compared with WT and Pld1−/− mice (Fig. 1, A and B). Furthermore, Pld2−/− mice showed significantly higher bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid protein content (Fig. 1C), and a small but significant increase in the IL-6 level in BAL fluids compared with WT, and Pld1−/− mice after a 3-h PAR-1–AP challenge (Fig. 1F) with no significant difference in BAL TNFα levels (Fig. 1G). The effect of PLD deficiency on PAR-1–AP-induced lung vascular leak was assessed in vivo by uptake of Evans blue dye conjugated to albumin as described (44Tian X. Tian Y. Gawlak G. Sarich N. Wu T. Birukova A.A. Control of vascular permeability by atrial natriuretic peptide via a GEF-H1-dependent mechanism.J. Biol.

As shown in Fig. 1D, PAR-1–AP induced a much greater increase in Evans blue dye uptake in Pld2−/− mice lungs as compared with WT or Pld1−/− mice indicating significantly greater lung vascular leakage in response to PAR-1–AP in Pld2-deficient mice. Additionally, the effect of Pld2 deficiency on pulmonary vascular capillary filtration coefficient (Kf,c) was investigated (Fig. 1E). Pld2−/− mice showed higher Kf,c compared with WT mice, indicating PLD2 plays a critical role in maintaining pulmonary vascular barrier function. Next, we determined the role of Pld1 and Pld2 in LPS-induced lung vascular permeability and inflammatory cell infiltration in the lungs of WT, Pld1−/−, and Pld2−/− mice. Interestingly, we observed that total BAL fluid protein and leukocyte counts at 6 h post-LPS challenge were similar between WT and Pld2−/− mice; however, BAL fluid protein and leukocyte count remained persistently higher in Pld2 knockout as compared with WT mice (Fig. 2, A–C). Similar to PAR-1–AP, LPS induced greater Evans blue dye uptake in Pld2−/− mice compared with WT or Pld1−/− mice at 24 h post-LPS challenge (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, Pld2−/− mice showed higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in BAL 24 h after LPS treatment (Fig. 2, E and F). Collectively, the in vivo and ex vivo data show that deletion of Pld2 in mice enhanced lung vascular leakage and inflammatory injury in response to PAR-1–AP or LPS challenge. Having demonstrated a role for Pld2 in PAR-1–AP and LPS-induced lung vascular leakage in mice, we next investigated PLD2/PA signaling in the regulation of thrombin- or LPS-induced endothelial permeability and VE-cadherin distribution in the cell periphery of human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HLMVECs) by transient inhibition of PLD2. In the first approach, we treated HLMVECs with 0.1% of 1-butanol for 1 h prior to thrombin challenge, as mammalian PLD1 and PLD2 not only catalyze hydrolysis of PC and other phospholipids to PA but also possess transphosphatidylase activity and generates phosphatidylbutanol instead of PA. This transphosphatidylation reaction is highly specific for short-chain primary alcohols, whereas secondary or tertiary short-chain alcohols do not serve as an acceptor of PA for the transphosphatidylation reaction in the presence of short-chain primary alcohol, such as 1-butanol, but not secondary or tertiary short-chain alcohol, such as 3-butanol (Fig. 3A) (41Garcia J.G. Fenton 2nd, J.W. Natarajan V. Thrombin stimulation of human endothelial cell phospholipase D activity: regulation by phospholipase C, protein kinase C, and cyclic adenosine 3′5′-monophosphate.Blood. 1992; 79 (1314112): 2056-2067PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, B and C, 1-butanol, but not 3-butanol (0.1%, v/v), significantly reduced re-annealing of AJs and recovery of transendothelial electrical resistance (TER), a measurement of AJ integrity, following a thrombin-induced increase in endothelial permeability. The effect of PA on endothelial barrier function was further confirmed by immunofluorescence staining of VE-cadherin in cells exposed to thrombin, which revealed significant disruption of VE-cadherin at AJs in both 1-butanol- and 3-butanol–pretreated HLMVECs induced by thrombin challenge at 30 min. However, 3-butanol exposure, which does not affect PA production and PA-mediated signaling, allowed full recovery of VE-cadherin at AJs at 180 min, whereas 1-butanol, which acts as an acceptor of PA, impaired the recovery of VE-cadherin at AJs post-thrombin challenge (Fig. 3, D and E). These findings suggest that PA generation from either PLD1 or PLD2 or both may be involved in the signaling pathways that regulate endothelial barrier recovery at AJs. As 1-butanol does not distinguish between PLD1 and PLD2, we overexpressed catalytically inactive adenoviral hPLD1 and mPld2 mutants, which function as dominant-negative mutants (32Jiang Y.

HLMVECs were infected with adenoviral control, hPLD1, or mPld2 dominant-negative mutants for 48 h prior to thrombin challenge. As shown in Fig. 3, F and G, at 30 min of thrombin treatment, VE-cadherin staining showed obvious disruption at AJs cells. The AJs were re-established in cells infected with adenoviral control and hPLD1 dominant mutant for 180 min, as indicated by VE-cadherin immunostaining. In contrast, mPld2 dominant-negative mutant-infected cells failed to re-establish continuous AJs. In parallel experiments, inhibition of PLD2 with the specific inhibitor VU0364739 significantly reduced reannealing of AJs in thrombin-stimulated cells as determined by re-distribution of VE-cadherin (Fig. 3, H and I). A similar effect of blocking PLD2 with PLD2 inhibitor VU0364739 was observed with LPS-induced VE-cadherin distribution at AJs in HLMVECs (Fig. 3, J and K). Next, we investigated the effect of thrombin on VE-cadherin distribution in cell periphery of mouse lung microvascular endothelial cells (MLMVECs). As show in Fig. 4, A and B, intensity of VE-cadherin in the cell periphery was significantly less in PLD2-deleted cells compared with the WT cells at 30 min post-thrombin stimulation. We also investigated the effect of ectopic expression of PLD2 on annealing AJs and recovery of barrier function in"

Mind wandering may improve creative problem solving; however, it could also lead to negative moods and poor mental health. It has also been shown that some forms of mental illness are positively related to creativity. However, the three factors of mind wandering, divergent thinking, and mental health have not been examined simultaneously, so it is possible that these relationships are manifested by spurious correlations. Therefore, we examined the relations among the three factors while controlling for each of their confounding effects. We asked 865 participants (458 men, 390 women, 17 unknown; Mage = 18.99 years, SD = 1.16) to complete a questionnaire measuring mind wandering traits, divergent thinking, and mental health measures including depressive symptoms and schizotypal personality. Multiple regression analysis showed that people who reported more depressive symptoms, schizotypal personality, and divergent thinking, were more likely to engage in mind-wandering. Our results indicated that frequency of mind wandering was linked to a risk of poorer mental health as well as to higher divergent thinking ability. In future research, we will examine the features of mind wandering related to divergent thinking and mental health by considering the contents of wandering thoughts and whether they are ruminative or not. We also need to examine whether the same results will be found when studying professionals in creative occupations, and when using different scoring methods in divergent thinking tests."

In timber, wood-decay fungi will come into contact with other fungi and bacteria. In naturally bleached wood, dark, pigmented lines arising from confrontation of two fungi often hint at such interactions. The metabolites (and pigment) exchange was investigated using the lignicolous basidiomycete Schizophyllum commune, and co-occurring fungi and bacteria inoculated directly on sterilized wood, or on media. In interactions with competitive wood degrading fungi, yeasts or bacteria, different competition strategies and communication types were observed, and stress reactions, as well as competitor-induced enzymes or pigments were analyzed. Melanin, indole, flavonoids and carotenoids were shown to be induced in S. commune interactions. The induced genes included multi-copper oxidases lcc1, lcc2, mco1, mco2, mco3 and mco4, possibly involved in both pigment production and lignin degradation typical for wood bleaching by wood-decay fungi."

https://openalex.org/W3020533087,"The two alkaloids gramine and hordenine have been known for playing a role in the allelopathic ability in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). These allelochemicals can be both found in leaves and roots in some barley cultivars whereas in others one seems to exclude the other. In this study eighteen accessions of barley from the Middle-East area, one accession from Tibet and the modern spring cultivar Barke, already used as parental donor in a nested associated mapping (NAM) population, were screened for their gramine, hordenine and N-methyltyramine (the direct precursor of hordenine) content in leaves, roots and exudates. Moreover, the toxicity of the three allelochemicals on root growth inhibition on lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) was evaluated. Results of this study showed the preferential production of gramine and hordenine in leaves and roots, respectively, in the nineteen barley accessions. On the other hand, in the modern barley cultivar Barke, the highest content of hordenine in roots and the general lack of gramine suggests a favored biosynthesis of the former. Gramine was not detected in the root exudates. In additions, different metabolomic profiles were observed in wild relatives compared to modern barley genotypes. The results also showed the phytotoxic effects of the three compounds on root growth of lettuce seedlings, with a reduction in root length and an increase of root surface area and diameter. In conclusion, this study highlighted the impact of the domestication effects on the production and distribution of the two allelopathic alkaloids gramine and hordenine in barley."
https://openalex.org/W3019360497,"President Trump and his administration have been regarded by news outlets and scholars as one of the most hostile administrations towards scientists and their work. However, no study to-date has empirically measured how federal scientists perceive the Trump administration with respect to their scientific work. In 2018, we distributed a survey to over 63,000 federal scientists from 16 federal agencies to assess their perception of scientific integrity. Here we discuss the results of this survey for a subset of these agencies: Department of Interior (DOI) agencies (the US Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), the US Geological Survey, and the National Park Service); the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC); the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA); the Food and Drug Administration (FDA); and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). We focus our analysis to 10 key questions fitting within three core categories that relate to perceptions of integrity in science. Additionally, we analyzed responses across agencies and compare responses in the 2018 survey to prior year surveys of federal scientists with similar survey questions. Our results indicate that federal scientists perceive losses of scientific integrity under the Trump Administration. Perceived loss of integrity in science was greater at the DOI and EPA where federal scientists ranked incompetent and untrustworthy leadership as top barriers to science-based decision-making, but this was not the case at the CDC, FDA, and NOAA where scientists positively associated leadership with scientific integrity. We also find that reports of political interference in scientific work and adverse work environments were higher at EPA and FWS in 2018 than in prior years. We did not find similar results at the CDC and FDA. These results suggest that leadership, positive work environments, and clear and comprehensive scientific integrity policies and infrastructure within agencies play important roles in how federal scientists perceive their agency's scientific integrity."

This study identifies food insecurity trajectories of homeless adults participating in a trial of a housing intervention and examines whether receiving the intervention and having specific mental and substance disorders predict food insecurity trajectories.We studied 520 participants in the Toronto site of the At Home/Chez-Soi project. Food insecurity data were collected at seven times during a follow-up period of up to 5.5 years. Mental and substance use disorders were assessed at baseline. Food insecurity trajectories were identified using group based-trajectory modeling. Multinomial logistic regression was used to examine the effects of the intervention and mental and substance use disorders on food insecurity trajectories.Four food insecurity trajectories were identified: persistently high food insecurity, increasing food insecurity, decreasing food insecurity, and consistently low food insecurity. Receiving the intervention was not a predictor of membership in any specific food insecurity trajectory group. Individuals with major depressive episode, mood disorder with psychotic features, substance disorder, and co-occurring disorder (defined as having at least one alcohol or other substance use disorder and at least one non-substance related mental disorder] were more likely to remain in the persistently high food insecurity group than the consistently low food insecurity group.A persistently high level of food insecurity is common among individuals with mental illness who have experienced homelessness, and the presence of certain mental health disorders increases this risk. Mental health services combined with access to resources for basic needs, and re-adaptation training are required to enhance the health and well-being of this population."
https://openalex.org/W3019874029,"Salmonella Enteritidis (SE) has been the most common Salmonella serotype associated with foodborne infections in the last several years. Dietary applications of yeast-based preparations in feed have shown to reduce Salmonella colonization in chickens augmenting SE control strategies. This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of a mannan-rich yeast cell wall-derived preparation (Actigen®) administered in feed at a rate of 400 g/ton on SE colonization in the cecum and internal organs of commercial layer chickens. Sixteen week-old layer pullets were orally challenged with a selected nalidixic acid resistant SE strain at a dose of 1.7×10^9 colony forming units (CFU) per bird. SE colonization was assessed by evaluating isolation rates from ovary and pooled liver/spleen samples as well as enumeration of SE in cecal pouches one week post-challenge. Recovery rates of SE from the ovaries of directly challenged birds receiving Actigen® were significantly lower (P <0.02) than those in directly challenged birds fed an unsupplemented control diet. Recovery rates of SE from pooled liver/spleen samples were not significantly different between Actigen®-treated pullets and controls (P = 0.22). Using direct plate count methods, cecal SE concentrations were 1 log10 lower (P <0.001) in challenged pullets in the Actigen®-supplemented group than in the challenged controls. The SE concentration distributions in the ceca were similar in groups testing positive and groups testing negative for SE in the ovaries and liver/spleens tissues. As a result, SE concentrations in the ceca could not be directly related to the occurrence or prevalence of SE in these tissues. In conclusion, Actigen® supplementation appears to decrease the prevalence of SE in ovarian tissue and concentrations of SE in cecal contents and may be useful as a tool for reducing the risk of eggshell contamination and transovarian transmission of SE in eggs."
https://openalex.org/W3019986913,"The aim of this study was to assess the effect of wearing optical correction on the choroidal structure in eyes of children with anisohypermetropic amblyopia. This study was conducted at the Nara Medical University Hospital and at the Tokushima University Hospital. Twenty-nine anisohypermetropic amblyopic eyes and their fellow eyes of 29 amblyopic patients (mean age, 5.7 ± 1.7 years, range 3- to 8-years) and twenty eyes of 20 age-similar control children (4.9 ± 0.8 years, range 4- to 6-years) were studied. All patients wore optical correction and 15 patients had both optical correction and patching. The values at the baseline were compared to that at one year later. The binarization method was used to determine the total, luminal, and stromal areas of the choroid in the enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomographic images. The best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of the amblyopic eyes was significantly improved after the one-year period. A large luminal area was characteristic of the amblyopic eye at the baseline, and it was significantly reduced after the optical treatment. The stromal area widened significantly in the amblyopic and fellow eyes after one year whereas there were no significant changes in the choroid of the control eyes after one year. After one-year of optical correction, the luminal/stromal ratios in the amblyopic and fellow eyes were decreased and were then not significantly different from that of the normal control eyes. There was a significant and positive correlation between the improvement of the BCVA and the stromal area at the baseline (r = 0.64, P = 0.001). Wearing corrective lenses on the amblyopic eyes improves the BCVA, and the choroidal structure of the amblyopic eye becomes closer to that of the control eyes. The narrowed luminal area is a specific response of the amblyopic eye associated with the correction of the refractive error. The larger stromal area in the amblyopic eyes at the baseline is a predictive factor for improvements of the BCVA."

Objective To determine factors associated with non-hospital deaths among cancer patients. Design Retrospective cohort study of cancer decedents, examining factors associated with non-hospital deaths using multinomial logistic regression with hospital deaths as the reference category. Setting/subjects Cancer patients (n = 15254) in Singapore who died during the study period from January 1, 2012 till December 31, 2105 at home, acute hospital, long-term care (LTC) or hospice were included. Results Increasing age (categories ≥65 years: RRR 1.25–2.61), female (RRR 1.40; 95% CI 1.28–1.52), Malays (RRR 1.67; 95% CI 1.47–1.89), Brain malignancy (RRR 1.92; 95% CI 1.15–3.23), metastatic disease (RRR 1.33–2.01) and home palliative care (RRR 2.11; 95% CI 1.95–2.29) were associated with higher risk of home deaths. Patients with low socioeconomic status were more likely to have hospice or LTC deaths: those living in smaller housing types had higher risk of dying in hospice (1–4 rooms apartment: RRR 1.13–3.17) or LTC (1–5 rooms apartment: RRR 1.36–4.11); and those with Medifund usage had higher risk of dying in LTC (RRR 1.74; 95% CI 1.36–2.21). Patients with haematological malignancies had increased risk of dying in hospital (categories of haematological subtypes: RRR 0.06–0.87). Conclusions We found key sociodemographic and clinical factors associated with non-hospital deaths in cancer patients. More can be done to enable patients to die in the community and with dignity rather than in a hospital."
https://openalex.org/W3019333067,"The use of social network sites helps people to make and maintain social ties accumulating social capital, which is increasingly important for individual success. There is a wide variation in the amount and structure of online ties, and to some extent this variation is contingent on specific online user behaviors which are to date under-researched. In this work, we examine an entire city-bounded friendship network (N = 194,601) extracted from VK social network site to explore how specific online user behaviors are related to structural social capital in a network of geographically proximate ties. Social network analysis was used to evaluate individual social capital as a network asset, and multiple regression analysis–to determine and estimate the effects of online user behaviors on social capital. The analysis reveals that the graph is both clustered and highly centralized which suggests the presence of a hierarchical structure: a set of sub-communities united by city-level hubs. Against this background, membership in more online groups is positively associated with user’s brokerage in the location-bounded network. Additionally, the share of local friends, the number of received likes and the duration of SNS use are associated with social capital indicators. This contributes to the literature on the formation of online social capital, examined at the level of a large and geographically localized population."

This paper traces the process of policy change using institutional theory as an organizational perspective. Based on the analysis of data from desk research and semi-structured interviews, we propose a model of institutional change and argue that in the 1990s, environmental activists and wildlife biologists successfully used a political window of opportunity connected with socio-economic transformation after 1989 and managed to induce the government to move the species from the domain of hunting to the domain of nature conservation. The new policy, informed by an ecological paradigm, diverged from the historical path dominated by hunters and the vision of the wolf as a pest and a hunting target. The improved protection led to the numerical growth of Poland's wolves and ultimately to their westward expansion."

Countries affected by humanitarian emergencies continue to report the highest neonatal mortality rates.To assess essential newborn care practices and its determinants amongst mothers of infants aged 0-6 months in refugee settlements in Adjumani district.A cross-sectional study was conducted among mothers of infants aged 0-6 months in refugee settlements, Adjumani district. A total of 561 mothers of infants were selected using systematic sampling technique from households. Data were collected using a semi-structured questionnaire. A composite outcome variable, Essential Newborn Care practices was created by merging different care practices (neonatal feeding, thermal care, and cord care). Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to determine predictors of Essential Newborn Care.Over half (57%) of the mothers breastfed their newborns within one hour. Half (50.1%) of mothers cleaned the umbilical cord of their newborns. Only 17% of the newborns received optimal thermal care immediately after birth. Mothers aged 20-24 years (OR 0.38, CI 0.17-0.96) and those involved in subsistence farming (OR 0.67, CI 0.38-1.45) were less likely to practice good newborn care compared to those in other occupations. Newborn care practices were sub-optimal in this refugee setting. To improve newborn care practices, there is need to educate mothers through community-based health interventions in order to promote delayed bathing, ideal infant feeding, thermal and umbilical cord care."
https://openalex.org/W3017518709,"Despite the potential for the chemokine class as therapeutic targets in immune mediated disease, success has been limited. Many chemokines can bind to multiple receptors and many receptors have multiple ligands, with few exceptions. One of those exceptions is CCL20, which exclusively pairs to CCR6 and is associated with several immunologic conditions, thus providing a promising therapeutic target. Following successful evaluation in a single dose, first time in human clinical study, GSK3050002-a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody against human CCL20-was evaluated in a 26-week cynomolgus monkey toxicology study. A high incidence of unexpected vascular and organ inflammation was observed microscopically, leading to the decision to halt clinical development. Here we report a dose-responsive increase in the incidence and severity of inflammation in multiple organs from monkeys receiving 30 and 300 mg/kg/week by either subcutaneous or intravenous injection. Histomorphological changes resembled an immune complex-mediated pathology, which is often due to formation of anti-drug antibodies in monkeys receiving a human protein therapeutic and thus not predictive of clinical outcome. However, the presentation was atypical in that there was a clear dose response with a very high incidence of inflammation with a low incidence of ADA that did not correlate well individually. Additionally, the immunohistologic presentation was atypical in that the severity and distribution of tissue inflammation was greater than the numbers of associated immune complexes (i.e., granular deposits). An extensive ex vivo analysis of large molecular weight protein complexes in monkey serum from this study and in human serum samples demonstrated a time-dependent aggregation of GSK3050002, that was not predicted by in vitro assays. The aggregates also contained complement components. These findings support the hypothesis that immune complexes of drug aggregates, not necessarily including anti-drug antibodies, can fix complement, accumulate over time, and trigger immune complex disease. A situation which may have increased clinical relevance than typical anti-drug antibody-associated immune complex disease in monkeys administered human antibody proteins."

One of the rare bacterial species recently associated with biofilms and negative cultures in infective endocarditis is Aerococcus urinae. Whether the low number of reported cases might be due to lack of awareness and misidentification, mainly as streptococci, is currently being discussed. To verify the relevance and biofilm potential of Aerococcus in endocarditis, we used fluorescence in situ hybridization to visualize the microorganisms within the heart valve tissue. We designed and optimized a specific FISH probe (AURI) for in situ visualization and identification of A. urinae in sections of heart valves from two IE patients whose 16S rRNA gene sequencing had deteced A. urinae. Both patients had a history of urinary tract infections. FISH visualized impressive in vivo grown biofilms in IE, thus confirming the potential of A. urinae as a biofilm pathogen. In both cases, FISH/PCR was the only method to unequivocally identify A. urinae as the only causative pathogen for IE. The specific FISH assay for A. urinae is now available for further application in research and diagnostics. A. urinae should be considered in endocarditis patients with a history of urinary tract infections. These findings support the biofilm potential of A. urinae as a virulence factor and are meant to raise the awareness of this pathogen."

The purpose of our study was to investigate the prevalence of adult unilateral hearing loss and the factors associated with hearing aid use in patients with unilateral hearing loss in South Korea. We obtained data from 2009 to 2012 from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (KNHANES), a cross-sectional, nationwide and population-based survey in the Republic of Korea. We analyzed the prevalence and associated factors of unilateral hearing loss and hearing aid adoption by univariable and multivariable analysis. Unilateral hearing loss was defined as pure tone average ≥ 41 dB in the worse hearing ear, and < 41 dB in the other ear assessed at 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 kHz. From 2009 to 2012, 33,252 individuals participated in the KNHANES. Among them, the number of patients with unilateral hearing loss was 1632 (5.55%) and the prevalence of hearing aid adoption in unilateral hearing loss was 1.56%. We also compared the factors between hearing aid users and non-users. Occupational status (OR 3.759, 95% CI 1.443–9.804), the hearing threshold in the better ear (OR 1.088, 95% CI 1.029–1.151), and hearing threshold in the worse ear (OR 1.031, 1.005–1.058) were found to affect the adoption of hearing aids. The prevalence of noise exposure at work in hearing aid users was significantly lower than the prevalence of noise exposure at work in those with no hearing aid. The prevalence of hearing aid use in patients with unilateral hearing loss in Korea is very low compared to other countries. Public health education is needed to increase public awareness of unilateral hearing loss, hearing aid adoption and its continued usage. Auditory rehabilitation should be actively recommended to patients with unilateral hearing loss."

This disease is important for public health due to the high prevalence, severity of clinical forms and heterogeneous spatial and temporal patterns. In Brazil, about 1.5 million people are at risk of infection with Schistosoma mansoni, with an annual average of 500 deaths. In this study, the temporal change in mortality was evaluated in relation to the effects of age, period and birth cohort, in Brazil and regions, from 1980 to 2014.In this study, we analyzed the influence of age, period and birth cohort (APC effects) on the temporal evolution of schistosomiasis mortality in Brazil from 1980 to 2014, according to sex and geographic regions of the country. The death records were extracted from the SIM (Mortality Information System) of the DATASUS website (Department of National Health Informatics) of the Ministry of Health of Brazil. The temporal effects were estimated using Bayesian models and the INLA (Integrated Nested Laplace Approximations) method for parameter inference.More than 24 thousand deaths were registered in the analyzed period, mainly in men from the Northeast region. In Brazil, children under 14 years of age had protection against death from schistosomiasis. There was no significant effect for others ages. From 1990 to 1999, there was a protective effect for death from schistosomiasis and a null effect in the other periods. There was a decreasing trend in the risk of death among birth cohorts. The greatest risk was among people born from 1903 to 1912. There was a protective effect for death among people born after 1968. Men were at risk of death between 25 and 54 years old, while women were at risk after seventy years of age. The southern and central-western regions had a risk of death until 1989 and had a protective effect between1995 and 1999. The northern region had a risk of death between 1985 and 1994, and a protective effect after 2005. The northeast and Southeast regions had protective effects for death between the years 1990 and 1999, and after 2000, respectively. People born until 1952 and 1957 were at risk of dying in the South and North regions, respectively, and a protective effect among people born after 1968, in both regions. In the Northeast region, there was a protective effect among people born after 1963. In the other regions, there was a risk of death among people born until 1962 and a protective effect among people born after 1973. The Central-West region had the least declining trend in risk of death among birth cohorts.The birth cohorts had a great influence on the decreasing trend of schistosomiasis mortality in Brazil. This result may be due to the interaction between demographic changes and greater access to health and sanitation services, in addition to the impact of schistosomiasis control measures experienced by younger cohorts."

Patients are often recommended nutritional guidelines to manage disease symptoms. However, the current food consumption pattern of US adults with IBD that are nationally representative is unclear. A secondary analysis of National Health Interview Survey 2015 was performed to characterize the estimated US adults with IBD and their food intake and consumption frequency using bivariate and multivariate logistic regression. Fries were consumed by a greater number of people with IBD. IBD population drank less 100% fruit juice and ate more cheese and cookies than non-IBD population. Intake of fries (OR 1.60, 95% CI 1.14-2.25) and sports and energy drinks (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.07-1.97) and more frequent drinking of regular soda were significantly associated with the likelihood of having been told one have IBD, while popcorn (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.548-0.971) and milk (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.497-0.998) were associated with smaller odds, adjusting for covariates. Foods typically labeled as junk food were positively associated with IBD. Nonetheless, of the assessed 26 foods, we found eating patterns between IBD and non-IBD population to be mostly analogous. It is unclear whether the results reflect potential change in food intake in IBD population long before the survey interview. Understanding the role of food intake in IBD risk/prevalence would benefit from identifying other environmental factors (i.e. food desert), food processing (i.e. frying), and potential bioactive food components that can induce intestinal inflammation that can increase the individual's susceptibility to IBD."
https://openalex.org/W3018896907,"Most U.S. states that have regulated and taxed cannabis have imposed some form of mandatory safety testing requirements. In California, the country's largest and oldest legal cannabis market, mandatory testing was first enforced by state regulators in July 2018, and additional mandatory tests were introduced at the end of 2018. All cannabis must be tested and labeled as certified by a state-licensed cannabis testing laboratory before it can be legally marketed in California. Every batch that is sold by licensed retailers must be tested for more than 100 contaminants, including 66 pesticides with tolerance levels lower than the levels allowable for any other agricultural product in California. This paper estimates the costs of compliance with mandatory cannabis testing laws and regulations, using California's testing regime as a case study. We use state government data, data collected from testing laboratories, and data collected from lab equipment suppliers to run a set of Monte Carlo simulations and estimate the cost per pound of compliance with California's new cannabis testing regulations. We find that cost per pound is highly sensitive to average batch size and testing failure rates. We present results under a variety of different assumptions about batch size and failure rates. We also find that under realistic assumptions, the loss of cannabis that must be destroyed if a batch fails testing accounts for a larger share of total testing costs than does the cost of the lab tests. Using our best estimates of average batch size (8 pounds) and failure rate (4%) in the 2019 California market, we estimate testing cost at $136 per pound of dried cannabis flower, or about 10 percent of the reported average wholesale price of legal cannabis in the state. Our findings explain effects of the testing standards on the cost of supplying legal licensed cannabis, in California, other U.S. states, and foreign jurisdictions with similar testing regimes."
https://openalex.org/W3018302781,"Plantaricin BM-1 is a class IIa bacteriocin with a strong bactericidal effect on gram-positive bacteria. Although plantaricin BM-1 also inhibits the growth of some gram-negative bacteria, including Escherichia coli, the mechanism is not clear. In this study, we used tandem mass tag-based quantitative proteomics analysis to examine the inhibitory mechanism of plantaricin BM-1 against E. coli K12, and evaluated the morphological effects by electron microscopy. The results demonstrated that plantaricin BM-1 inhibits the growth of E. coli K12 by bacteriostatic action, mainly acting on the surface of the cell wall, leading to its collapse. Proteomic analysis identified 976 differentially expressed proteins (>1.2-fold change, p < 0.05) under treatment with plantaricin BM-1, including 490 up-regulated proteins and 486 down-regulated proteins. These proteins were mainly involved in peptidoglycan synthesis and energy metabolism pathways, including amino acid, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate, ABC transporter, and quorum-sensing pathways. Specifically, plantaricin BM-1 treatment significantly improved peptidoglycan synthesis and enhanced the tricarboxylic acid cycle in E. coli K12, and altered the expression of cell membrane proteins. These results provide new insight into the inhibition mechanism of class IIa bacteriocins on gram-negative bacteria, which can lay the foundation for its broader use as an alternative to conventional antibiotics."
https://openalex.org/W3018974225,"The heptapeptide angiotensin-(1–7) (Ang-(1–7)) is protective in the cardiovascular system through its induction of vasodilator production and angiogenesis. Despite acting antagonistically to the effects of elevated, pathophysiological levels of angiotensin II (AngII), recent evidence has identified convergent and beneficial effects of low levels of both Ang-(1–7) and AngII. Previous work identified the AngII receptor type I (AT1R) as a component of the protein complex formed when Ang-(1–7) binds its receptor, Mas1. Importantly, pharmacological blockade of AT1R did not alter the effects of Ang-(1–7). Here, we use a novel mutation of AT1RA in the Dahl salt-sensitive (SS) rat to test the hypothesis that interaction between Mas1 and AT1R contributes to proangiogenic Ang-(1–7) signaling. In a model of hind limb angiogenesis induced by electrical stimulation, we find that the restoration of skeletal muscle angiogenesis in SS rats by Ang-(1–7) infusion is impaired in AT1RA knockout rats. Enhancement of endothelial cell (EC) tube formation capacity by Ang-(1–7) is similarly blunted in AT1RA mutant ECs. Transcriptional changes elicited by Ang-(1–7) in SS rat ECs are altered in AT1RA mutant ECs, and tandem mass spectrometry-based proteomics demonstrate that the protein complex formed upon binding of Ang-(1–7) to Mas1 is altered in AT1RA mutant ECs. Together, these data support the hypothesis that interaction between AT1R and Mas1 contributes to proangiogenic Ang-(1–7) signaling."

Additionally, the impact of hmMGMT and disruptive TP53-mutations on relapse was investigated in patients with HNSCC. Methods This study included 164 patients with HNSCC who were negative for both p16 protein expression and human papilloma virus infection. The association of smoking and hmMGMT was investigated using multiple logistic regression analysis. Competing risk regression was used to evaluate the effects of hmMGMT and TP53-mutations in exon 2 to 11 on relapse of HNSCC. Results hmMGMT was observed in 84% of the 164 patients. TP53-mutations, specifically, G:C>A:T transition, were more frequent in patients with hmMGMT (32%) than in those without hmMGMT (8%). The frequency of disruptive TP53-mutations was not significantly different between groups. Compared with nonsmoking, heavy smoking of 20 pack-years or more was significantly associated with decreased hmMGMT (adjusted odds ratio, 0.08; 95% CI, 0.01 to 0.56; P = 0.01). Patients who had both hmMGMT and disruptive TP53-mutations showed a significantly higher relapse rate than all other patients (subdistribution hazard ratio, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.07 to 2.92; P = 0.026). Conclusions It was found that hmMGMT was suppressed by heavy smoking, and hmMGMT combined with disruptive TP53-mutations may indicate a poor prognosis in patients with HNSCC."
https://openalex.org/W3017730646,"Chronic kidney diseases affect more than 800 million people globally and remain a high unmet need. Various therapeutic targets are currently under evaluation in pre-clinical and clinical studies. Because the growth arrest specific gene 6 (Gas6)/AXL pathway has been implicated in the pathogenesis of kidney diseases, we generated a novel selective and potent AXL inhibitor, CH5451098, and we evaluated its efficacy and elucidated its mechanism in an NEP25 mouse model that follows the clinical course of glomerular nephritis. In this model, CH5451098 significantly ameliorated the excretion of urinary albumin and elevation of serum creatinine. Additionally, it also inhibited tubulointerstitial fibrosis and tubular damage. To elucidate the mechanism behind these changes, we analyzed the effect of CH5451098 against transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1) and Gas6, which is a ligand of AXL receptor, in NRK-52E renal tubular epithelial cells. CH5451098 inhibited epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) caused by the synergistic effects of TGFβ1 and Gas6 in NRK-52E cells. This inhibition was also observed in NEP25 mice. Taken together, these results suggest that CH5451098 could ameliorate kidney dysfunction in glomerular nephritis by inhibiting EMT in tubular cells. These results reveal that AXL strongly contributes to the disease progression of glomerular nephritis."
https://openalex.org/W3020181358,"Introduction Uninsured patients have decreased access to care, lower rates of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and worse outcomes after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The aim of this study was to determine whether expanding insurance coverage through the Affordable Care Act’s expansion of Medicaid eligibility affected access to PCI hospitals, rates of PCI, 30-day readmissions, and in-hospital mortality after AMI. Methods Quasi-experimental, difference-in-differences analysis of Medicaid and uninsured patients with acute myocardial infarction in California, which expanded Medicaid through the Affordable Care Act, and Florida, which did not, from 2010–2015. This study accounts for the early expansion of Medicaid in certain California counties that began as early as July 2011. Main outcomes included rates of admission to PCI hospitals, rates of transfer for patients who initially presented to non-PCI hospitals, rates of PCI, rates of early PCI defined as within 48 hours of hospital admission, in-hospital mortality, and 30-day readmission. Results 55,991 hospital admissions between 2010–2015 met inclusion criteria. Of these, 32,540 were in California, which expanded Medicaid, and 23,451 were in Florida, which did not. 30-day readmission rates after AMI decreased by an absolute difference of 1.22 percentage points after the Medicaid expansion (95% CI -2.14 to -0.30, P < 0.01). This represented a relative decrease in readmission rates of 9.5% after AMI. No relationship between the Medicaid expansion and admission to PCI hospitals, transfer to PCI hospitals, rates of PCI, rates of early PCI, or in-hospital mortality were observed. Conclusions Hospital readmissions decreased by 9.5% after the Affordable Care Act expanded Medicaid eligibility, although there was no association found between Medicaid expansion and access to PCI hospitals or treatment with PCI. Better understanding the ways that Medicaid expansion might affect care for vulnerable populations with AMI is important for policymakers considering whether to expand Medicaid eligibility in their state."
https://openalex.org/W3020703781,"Small intestinal neuroendocrine tumors (SINT) are rare with incidence increasing over the past 40 years. The purpose of this work is to examine the role of environmental exposures in the rise of SINT incidence using the Utah Population Database, a resource of linked records including life events, cancer diagnoses and residential histories. SINT cases born in Utah were identified through the Utah Cancer Registry with: diagnosis years of 1948 to 2014 and age at diagnosis of 23 to 88 years. Controls were matched to cases 10:1 based on sex, birth year and residence time in Utah. Cases and controls were geocoded to their birth locale. An isotonic spatial scan statistic was used to test for the occurrence and location(s) of SINT clusters. Potential environmental exposures and economic conditions in the birth locales at the time of the birth (1883–1982) were generated using historical references. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate odd ratios. We report a spatial cluster central to historic coal mining communities, associated with a 2.86 relative risk (p = 0.016) of SINT. Aspatial analyses of industry and mining exposures further suggest elevated risk for early life exposure near areas involved in the construction industry (OR 1.98 p = 0.024). Other exposures approached significance including coal, uranium and hard rock mining during the earliest period (1883–1929) when safety from exposures was not considered. We do observe a lower risk (OR 0.58 p = 0.033) associated with individuals born in rural areas in the most recent period (1945–1982). Environmental exposures early in life, especially those from industries such as mining, may confer an elevated risk of SINT."
https://openalex.org/W3018220844,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), caused by the abnormal recognition of human joint cells by autoimmune antibodies, remains the world’s most prevalent autoimmune disease, with over five million people affected and as much as 4% of the population at risk of RA. To prevent rapid disease development, hormonal and anti-inflammatory therapies require fast and reliable RA diagnosis. However, difficulty in detecting early specific biomarkers for RA means that it is unclear when treatment needs to begin. Here, we combined synthesis of citrullinated peptide epitopes with molecular diagnostics to verify a new specific biomarker for early RA diagnosis and flare prediction. A fibrinogen-derived 21-amino-acid-long citrullinated peptide showed high reactivity toward autoantibodies in RA samples. Additionally, the level of antibodies to this epitope was elevated prior to flares. In contrast, other citrullinated protein variants had lower reactivity and poorer sensitivity to disease activity. In conclusion, fibrinogen-derived epitope E2 subjected to citrullination facilitated a reliable RA diagnosis with a strong correlation to disease activity. This is of a high value for the diagnosis and management of RA patients who respond poorly to treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3020468295,"Ecological theory suggests that generalist species should have traits with multiple adaptive peaks. Consequently, in heterogeneous environments such adaptive landscapes may lead to phenotypic divergence that becomes fixed in populations via reproductive isolation, thus driving speciation. However, contrary to this expectation, the process of ecological diversification in wild populations is not always associated with obvious trait divergence and reproductive isolation due to some ecological and geographic constrains. To examine the ecological conditions that promote (or inhibit) divergence is quite important to improve our understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Here we examine how the patterns of trait variation (divergence/non-divergence) are determined in relation to ecological niche expansion and gene flow using a benthic fish, Pseudogobio esocinus, in the Lake Biwa system, Japan. The fish exhibited various patterns of morphological variation in mouth parts among populations. Lake fish tended to have a smaller mouth compared with river fish and also showed remarkable individual variations within some local samples. Lake fish utilized chironomid larvae as the primary prey, as in riverine fish. But, fish with smaller and narrower mouths utilized significantly higher proportions of amphipods (a novel prey unique to the lake) as their secondary prey. Microsatellite analysis detected no genetic structuring in the Lake Biwa catchment, suggesting no reproductive separation among eco-morphologically divergent individuals. Our results exemplify population niche expansion associated with continuous eco-morphological variation without divergence, and provide insights into the role of non-discrete diversification for thriving in heterogeneous environments."
https://openalex.org/W3017640636,"Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is characterised by phenotypic heterogeneity, which we hypothesise is a consequence of deregulated differentiation with transcriptional reminiscence of the normal compartment or cell-of-origin. Here, we propose a classification system based on normal myeloid progenitor cell subset-associated gene signatures (MAGS) for individual assignments of AML subtypes. We generated a MAGS classifier including the progenitor compartments CD34+/CD38- for haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), CD34+/CD38+/CD45RA- for megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors (MEPs), and CD34+/CD38+/CD45RA+ for granulocytic-monocytic progenitors (GMPs) using regularised multinomial regression with three discrete outcomes and an elastic net penalty. The regularisation parameters were chosen by cross-validation, and MAGS assignment accuracy was validated in an independent data set (N = 38; accuracy = 0.79) of sorted normal myeloid subpopulations. The prognostic value of MAGS assignment was studied in two clinical cohorts (TCGA: N = 171; GSE6891: N = 520) and had a significant prognostic impact. Furthermore, multivariate Cox regression analysis using the MAGS subtype, FAB subtype, cytogenetics, molecular genetics, and age as explanatory variables showed independent prognostic value. Molecular characterisation of subtypes by differential gene expression analysis, gene set enrichment analysis, and mutation patterns indicated reduced proliferation and overrepresentation of RUNX1 and IDH2 mutations in the HSC subtype; increased proliferation and overrepresentation of CEBPA mutations in the MEP subtype; and innate immune activation and overrepresentation of WT1 mutations in the GMP subtype. We present a differentiation-dependent classification system for AML subtypes with distinct pathogenetic and prognostic importance that can help identify candidates poorly responding to combination chemotherapy and potentially guide alternative treatments."
https://openalex.org/W3017743349,"Background and objective Clinical observations indicate that implicit procedural learning, a central component of physical and psychosocial rehabilitation, is impeded following spinal cord injury. In accordance, previous research has revealed a specific deficit in implicit sequence learning among individuals with paraplegia using a standard, manual version of the serial reaction time task. To extend these findings and shed light on the underlying sources of potential spinal cord injury-related deficits in sequence learning, we used an ocular activated serial reaction time task to compare sequence learning performance between individuals with tetraplegia and healthy controls. Participants and measures Twelve participants with spinal cord injury in C5-T1 were compared to 12 matched control participants on measures derived from an ocular activated serial reaction time task. Depression and additional cognitive measures were assessed to explore the source and specificity of potential sequence learning deficits. Results Like controls, and in contrast with previous findings in paraplegia, the spinal cord injury group showed intact implicit sequence learning, evidenced by declining reaction times and improved anticipation over the first six blocks of the serial reaction time task, and an advantage for the initial learning sequence over a novel interference sequence. Conclusions The ocular activated serial reaction time task elicited a performance pattern similar to standard motor versions, such that participants with tetraplegia demonstrated unimpaired sequence learning. This suggests that previously reported implicit sequence learning deficits in spinal cord injury directly involved motor functioning rather than cognitive aspects of the task, and that the ocular activated sequence learning task could be a valid alternative for assessing implicit sequence learning in populations that cannot perform spinal-cord dependent motor tasks. Implications for post-spinal cord injury rehabilitation and adjustment are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3020193124,"There is great concern regarding the rapid emergence and spread of drug-resistance in Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite responsible for the most severe form of human malaria. Parasite populations resistant to some or all the currently available antimalarial treatments are present in different world regions. Considering the need for novel and integrated approaches to control malaria, combinations of drugs were tested on P. falciparum. The primary focus was on doxycycline, an antibiotic that specifically targets the apicoplast of the parasite. In combination with doxycycline, three different drugs known to inhibit efflux pumps (verapamil, elacridar and ivermectin) were tested, with the assumption that they could increase the intracellular concentration of the antibiotic and consequently its efficacy against P. falciparum. We emphasize that elacridar is a third-generation ABC transporters inhibitor, never tested before on malaria parasites. In vitro experiments were performed on asexual stages of two strains of P. falciparum, chloroquine-sensitive (D10) and chloroquine-resistant (W2). Incubation times on asynchronous or synchronous cultures were 72h or 96h, respectively. The antiplasmodial effect (i.e. the IC50) was determined by measuring the activity of the parasite lactate dehydrogenase, while the interaction between drugs was determined through combination index (CI) analyses. Elacridar achieved an IC50 concentration comparable to that of ivermectin, approx. 10-fold lower than that of verapamil, the other tested ABC transporter inhibitor. CI results showed synergistic effect of verapamil plus doxycycline, which is coherent with the starting hypothesis, i.e. that ABC transporters represent potential targets, worth of further investigations, towards the development of companion molecules useful to enhance the efficacy of antimalarial drugs. At the same time, the observed antagonistic effect of doxycycline in combination with ivermectin or elacridar highlighted the importance of drug testing, to avoid the de-facto generation of a sub-dosage, a condition that facilitates the development of drug resistance."
https://openalex.org/W3017654480,"High-speed trains are operated in increasingly complex railway networks and continual improvement of driver assistance systems is necessary to maintain safety. Speech offers the opportunity to provide information to the driver without disrupting visual attention. However, it is not known whether the transient pressure changes inside trains passing through tunnels interfere with speech intelligibility. Our primary goal was to test whether the most severe pressure variations occurring in high-speed trains (25 hPa in 2 s) affect speech intelligibility in individuals with normal hearing ability and secondly whether a potential effect would depend on the direction of the pressure change. A cross-over design was used to compare speech intelligibility, measured with the monosyllable word test by Wallenberg and Kollmeier, in steady ambient pressure versus subsequent to pressure events, both realised in a pressure chamber. Since data for a power calculation did not exist, we conducted a pilot study with 20 participants to estimate variance of intra-individual differences. The upper 80% confidence limit guided sample size of the main campaign, which was performed with 72 participants to identify a 10% difference while limiting alpha (5%) and beta error (10%). On average, a participant understood 0.7 fewer words following a pressure change event compared to listening in steady ambient pressure. However, this intra-individual differences varied strongly between participants, standard deviation (SD) ± 4.5 words, resulting in a negligible effect size of 0.1 and the Wilcoxon signed rank test (Z = -1.26; p = 0.21) did not distinguish it from chance. When comparing decreasing and increasing pressure events an average of 0.2 fewer words were understood (± 3.9 SD). The most severe pressure changes expected to occur in high-speed trains passing through tunnels do not interfere with speech intelligibility and are in itself not a risk factor for loss of verbal information transmission."
https://openalex.org/W3018291864,"Forcipomyia taiwana is a tiny hematophagous midge that attacks en masse. It is responsible for the most prevalent biting insect allergy in Taiwan. For t 2 is its major allergen. The intense itchy reactions can prevent allergic individuals from performing their regular daily outdoor activities. This study aimed to investigate whether the For t 2 DNA vaccine was effective in treating mice with established biting midge allergy. Mice were sensitized with recombinant For t 2 proteins or whole midge extracts. Two to four consecutive shots of various concentrations of For t 2 DNA vaccine, with or without CpG adjuvants, were then administered to midge-sensitized mice. Mice that received two shots of 50–100 μg For t 2 DNA vaccine showed a significant reduction in allergen-induced bouts of scratching, For t 2-specific IgE, specific IgG1/IgG2a ratio in sera, skin eosinophil infiltration, and IL-31 production, as well as IL-4 and IL-13 production by splenocytes. Two doses of For t 2 DNA vaccine one week apart was sufficient to treat mice with established biting midge allergy. The treatment resulted in clinical, immunological, and histopathological improvements. We recommend that this low-cost, convenient treatment strategy be developed for use in humans who are allergic to biting midges."
https://openalex.org/W3019916421,"The social interactions that we experience from early infancy often involve actions that are not strictly instrumental but engage the recipient by eliciting a (complementary) response. Interactive gestures may have privileged access to our perceptual and motor systems either because of their intrinsically engaging nature or as a result of extensive social learning. We compared these two hypotheses in a series of behavioral experiments by presenting individuals with interactive gestures that call for motor responses to complement the interaction (‘hand shaking’, ‘requesting’, ‘high-five’) and with communicative gestures that are equally socially relevant and salient, but do not strictly require a response from the recipient (‘Ok’, ‘Thumbs up’, ‘Peace’). By means of a spatial compatibility task, we measured the interfering power of these task-irrelevant stimuli on the behavioral responses of individuals asked to respond to a target. Across three experiments, our results showed that the interactive gestures impact on response selection and reduce spatial compatibility effects as compared to the communicative (non-interactive) gestures. Importantly, this effect was independent of the activation of specific social scripts that may interfere with response selection. Overall, our results show that interactive gestures have privileged access to our perceptual and motor systems, possibly because they entail an automatic preparation to respond that involuntary engages the motor system of the observers. We discuss the implications from a developmental and neurophysiological point of view."
https://openalex.org/W3020702351,"While the scale-up of HIV services has improved national health management information systems (HMIS), there remain challenges in using routine data to guide the introduction of optimized antiretroviral (ARV) drugs.Building on the recent enhancements to the HMIS in Kenya and coinciding with the introduction of a new ARV regimen, tenofovir+lamivudine+dolutegravir (TLD), we developed and implemented an enhanced data system (EDS) to improve availability of safety and efficacy data among people living with HIV (PLHIV) in Kenya. Using data from one health facility, we showcase how the EDS can be used to monitor ARV transition and identify missed opportunities to transition eligible patients to optimized regimes.The EDS was designed to create a comprehensive PLHIV database by triangulating patient-level data from the EMR, the pharmacy ARV dispensing tool (ADT) and HIV viral load (VL) databases. On a monthly basis, the database is de-identified and uploaded into a national data warehouse, with interactive dashboards. Using the EDS, we determined that of the 5,500 PLHIV ≥15 years on first-line ART at one facility, 4,233 (77%) had transitioned to optimized ARVs. Of the 1,267 still on legacy regimens, 459 (36%) were determined to be eligible and prioritized to switch.This project illustrates how enhancements to the national HMIS can facilitate the use of routine patient-level data to monitor the transition to new ARVs and inform the national HIV response."
https://openalex.org/W3018904891,"The affordability of next-generation genomic sequencing and the improvement of medical data management have contributed largely to the evolution of biological analysis from both a clinical and research perspective. Precision medicine is a response to these advancements that places individuals into better-defined subsets based on shared clinical and genetic features. The identification of personalized diagnosis and treatment options is dependent on the ability to draw insights from large-scale, multi-modal analysis of biomedical datasets. Driven by a real use case, we premise that platforms that support precision medicine analysis should maintain data in their optimal data stores, should support distributed storage and query mechanisms, and should scale as more samples are added to the system. We extended a genomics-based columnar data store, GenomicsDB, for ease of use within a distributed analytics platform for clinical and genomic data integration, known as the ODA framework. The framework supports interaction from an i2b2 plugin as well as a notebook environment. We show that the ODA framework exhibits worst-case linear scaling for array size (storage), import time (data construction), and query time for an increasing number of samples. We go on to show worst-case linear time for both import of clinical data and aggregate query execution time within a distributed environment. This work highlights the integration of a distributed genomic database with a distributed compute environment to support scalable and efficient precision medicine queries from a HIPAA-compliant, cohort system in a real-world setting. The ODA framework is currently deployed in production to support precision medicine exploration and analysis from clinicians and researchers at UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine."
https://openalex.org/W3018988500,"Potato Alternaria leaf blight is one of the economically most important disease in potato production worldwide. A recent study reported a quick method to distinguish main Alternaria pathogens A. tenuissima, A. alternata, and A. solani using partial histone H3 gene sequences. Using this method, our collection of 79 isolates from 8 provinces in China were presumably separated into A. tenussima and A. alternata. But in depth morphological and genetic analysis casted doubt on this identification. Culture morphologies of six presumed A. alternata isolates (PresA_alt) and six presumed A. tenuissima isolates (PresA_ten) were not significantly different. PresA_ten isolates also produced conidia in branched chains which supposed to be A. aternata. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted using internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) and five genes commonly used for species identification including glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH), translation elongation factor 1-alpha (TEF1), β-tubulin, plasma membrane ATPase (ATPase), and calmodulin genes. The results showed that GPDH and TEF1 sequences of PresA_alt and PresA_ten isolates were identical. The 12 isolates did not cluster by presumed species neither by individual or concatenated sequence comparisons. The phylogeny-trait association analysis confirmed that the two group isolates were undistinguishable by those molecular markers. Analysis of histone H3 gene sequences revealed variable intron sequences between PresA_ten and PresA_alt isolates, but the amino acid sequences were identical. Our results indicate that the previously published method to distinguish Alternaria species based on histone H3 gene sequence variation is inaccurate and that the prevalence of A. tenuissima isolates in China was likely overestimated."
