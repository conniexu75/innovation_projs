https://openalex.org/W2165011536,"DNA microarrays containing virtually every gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae were used to carry out a comprehensive investigation of the temporal program of gene expression accompanying the metabolic shift from fermentation to respiration. The expression profiles observed for genes with known metabolic functions pointed to features of the metabolic reprogramming that occur during the diauxic shift, and the expression patterns of many previously uncharacterized genes provided clues to their possible functions. The same DNA microarrays were also used to identify genes whose expression was affected by deletion of the transcriptional co-repressor TUP1 or overexpression of the transcriptional activator YAP1 . These results demonstrate the feasibility and utility of this approach to genomewide exploration of gene expression patterns."
https://openalex.org/W2100882223,"Bacillus subtilis is the best-characterized member of the Gram-positive bacteria. Its genome of 4,214,810 base pairs comprises 4,100 protein-coding genes. Of these protein-coding genes, 53% are represented once, while a quarter of the genome corresponds to several gene families that have been greatly expanded by gene duplication, the largest family containing 77 putative ATP-binding transport proteins. In addition, a large proportion of the genetic capacity is devoted to the utilization of a variety of carbon sources, including many plant-derived molecules. The identification of five signal peptidase genes, as well as several genes for components of the secretion apparatus, is important given the capacity of Bacillus strains to secrete large amounts of industrially important enzymes. Many of the genes are involved in the synthesis of secondary metabolites, including antibiotics, that are more typically associated with Streptomyces species. The genome contains at least ten prophages or remnants of prophages, indicating that bacteriophage infection has played an important evolutionary role in horizontal gene transfer, in particular in the propagation of bacterial pathogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2030573603,"BAD is a distant member of the Bcl-2 family that promotes cell death. Phosphorylation of BAD prevents this. BAD phosphorylation induced by interleukin-3 (IL-3) was inhibited by specific inhibitors of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). Akt, a survival-promoting serine-threonine protein kinase, was activated by IL-3 in a PI 3-kinase-dependent manner. Active, but not inactive, forms of Akt were found to phosphorylate BAD in vivo and in vitro at the same residues that are phosphorylated in response to IL-3. Thus, the proapoptotic function of BAD is regulated by the PI 3-kinase-Akt pathway."

https://openalex.org/W1993520606,"The signal transducer and activator of transcription–3 (Stat3) protein is activated by the interleukin 6 (IL-6) family of cytokines, epidermal growth factor, and leptin. A protein named PIAS3 (protein inhibitor of activated STAT) that binds to Stat3 was isolated and characterized. The association of PIAS3 with Stat3 in vivo was only observed in cells stimulated with ligands that cause the activation of Stat3. PIAS3 blocked the DNA-binding activity of Stat3 and inhibited Stat3-mediated gene activation. Although Stat1 is also phosphorylated in response to IL-6, PIAS3 did not interact with Stat1 or affect its DNA-binding or transcriptional activity. The results indicate that PIAS3 is a specific inhibitor of Stat3."
https://openalex.org/W1984083837,"A systematic search of the nonrecombining region of the human Y chromosome (NRY) identified 12 novel genes or families, 10 with full-length complementary DNA sequences. All 12 genes, and six of eight NRY genes or families previously isolated by less systematic means, fell into two classes. Genes in the first group were expressed in many organs; these housekeeping genes have X homologs that escape X inactivation. The second group, consisting of Y-chromosomal gene families expressed specifically in testes, may account for infertility among men with Y deletions. The coherence of the NRY's gene content contrasts with the apparently haphazard content of most eukaryotic chromosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1505270625,"Meristems are distinctive regions of plants that have capacity for continuous growth. Their developmental activity generates the majority of plant organs1. It is currently unknown how cell division and cell differentiation are orchestrated in meristems, although genetic studies have demonstrated the relevance of a proper balance between the two processes2,3,4,5,6. Root meristems contain a distinct central region of mitotically inactive cells, the quiescent centre7, the function of which has remained elusive until now. Here we present laser ablation and genetic data that show that in Arabidopsis thaliana the quiescent centre inhibits differentiation of surrounding cells. Differentiation regulation occurs within the range of a single cell, in a manner strikingly similar to examples in animal development, such as during delamination of Drosophila neuroblasts8. Our data indicate that pattern formation in the root meristem is controlled by a balance between short-range signals inhibiting differentiation and signals that reinforce cell fate decisions9."
https://openalex.org/W2010768970,"Organically modified aluminosilicate mesostructures were synthesized from two metal alkoxides with the use of poly(isoprene- b -ethyleneoxide) block copolymers (PI-b-PEO) as the structure-directing molecules. By increasing the fraction of the inorganic precursors with respect to the polymer, morphologies expected from the phase diagrams of diblock copolymers were obtained. The length scale of the microstructures and the state of alignment were varied using concepts known from the study of block copolymers. These results suggest that the use of higher molecular weight block copolymer mesophases instead of conventional low–molecular weight surfactants may provide a simple, easily controlled pathway for the preparation of various silica-type mesostructures that extends the accessible length scale of these structures by about an order of magnitude."
https://openalex.org/W1982898366,"The alpha proton x-ray spectrometer (APXS) on board the rover of the Mars Pathfinder mission measured the chemical composition of six soils and five rocks at the Ares Vallis landing site. The soil analyses show similarity to those determined by the Viking missions. The analyzed rocks were partially covered by dust but otherwise compositionally similar to each other. They are unexpectedly high in silica and potassium, but low in magnesium compared to martian soils and martian meteorites. The analyzed rocks are similar in composition to terrestrial andesites and close to the mean composition of Earth's crust. Addition of a mafic component and reaction products of volcanic gases to the local rock material is necessary to explain the soil composition."
https://openalex.org/W2172010722,"The ras proto-oncogene is frequently mutated in human tumors and functions to chronically stimulate signal transduction cascades resulting in the synthesis or activation of specific transcription factors, including Ets, c-Myc, c-Jun, and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB). These Ras-responsive transcription factors are required for transformation, but the mechanisms by which these proteins facilitate oncogenesis have not been fully established. Oncogenic Ras was shown to initiate a p53-independent apoptotic response that was suppressed through the activation of NF-kappaB. These results provide an explanation for the requirement of NF-kappaB for Ras-mediated oncogenesis and provide evidence that Ras-transformed cells are susceptible to apoptosis even if they do not express the p53 tumor-suppressor gene product."
https://openalex.org/W2062264071,"Leukocytes extravasate from the blood into inflammatory sites through complementary ligand interactions between leukocytes and endothelial cells. Activation of T cells increases their binding to hyaluronate (HA) and enables CD44-mediated primary adhesion (rolling). This rolling could be induced in vivo in murine Vbeta8(+) T cells in response to specific superantigen stimulation; it was initially found in lymph nodes, then in peripheral blood, and finally within the peritoneum, the original inflamed site. The migration of Vbeta8(+) cells into the peritoneal cavity was dependent on CD44 and HA, as shown by inhibition studies. Thus, CD44-HA interactions can target lymphocytes to specific extralymphoid effector sites."
https://openalex.org/W2043883478,"Experiments in Serengeti National Park, Tanzania, provide direct evidence that large, free-ranging mammalian grazers accelerate nutrient cycling in a natural ecosystem in a way that enhances their own carrying capacity. Both nitrogen and sodium were at considerably higher plant-available levels in soils of highly grazed sites than in soils of nearby areas where animal density is sparse. Fencing that uncoupled grazers and soils indicated that the animals promote nitrogen availability on soils of inherently similar fertility and select sites of higher sodium availability as well as enhancing that availability."
https://openalex.org/W1996567441,"Genetically distinct populations are an important component of biodiversity. This work estimates the number of populations per area of a sample of species from literature on population differentiation and the average range area of a species from a sample of distribution maps. This yields an estimate of about 220 populations per species, or 1.1 to 6.6 billion populations globally. Assuming that population extinction is a linear function of habitat loss, approximately 1800 populations per hour (16 million annually) are being destroyed in tropical forests alone."

https://openalex.org/W2031576371,"The Mars Pathfinder atmospheric structure investigation/meteorology (ASI/MET) experiment measured the vertical density, pressure, and temperature structure of the martian atmosphere from the surface to 160 km, and monitored surface meteorology and climate for 83 sols (1 sol = 1 martian day = 24.7 hours). The atmospheric structure and the weather record are similar to those observed by the Viking 1 lander (VL-1) at the same latitude, altitude, and season 21 years ago, but there are differences related to diurnal effects and the surface properties of the landing site. These include a cold nighttime upper atmosphere; atmospheric temperatures that are 10 to 12 degrees kelvin warmer near the surface; light slope-controlled winds; and dust devils, identified by their pressure, wind, and temperature signatures. The results are consistent with the warm, moderately dusty atmosphere seen by VL-1."

A magnetic field induces transitions between the ground and excited states. These transitions were analyzed in terms of crossings between single-particle states, singlet-triplet transitions, spin polarization, and Hund's rule. These impurity-free quantum dots allow “atomic physics” experiments to be performed in magnetic field regimes not accessible for atoms."
https://openalex.org/W2083516848,"Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) degradation of aberrant proteins is mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Here, a membrane-bound component of the ubiquitin system, Cue1p, was identified. It was shown to recruit the soluble ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubc7p to the ER membrane. In the absence of Cue1p, unassembled and thus cytosolically mislocalized Ubc7p was unable to participate in ER degradation or in the turnover of soluble non-ER proteins. Moreover, ubiquitination by Cue1p-assembled Ubc7p and Ubc6p was a prerequisite for retrograde transport of lumenal substrates out of the ER, which suggests that ubiquitination is mechanistically integrated into the ER degradation process."
https://openalex.org/W1963563101,"Bloom's syndrome (BS) is an autosomal recessive condition characterized by short stature, immunodeficiency, and a greatly elevated frequency of many types of cancer. The gene mutated in BS, BLM, encodes a protein containing seven “signature” motifs conserved in a wide range of DNA and RNA helicases. BLM is most closely related to the subfamily of DEXH box-containing DNA helicases of which the prototypical member is Escherichia coli RecQ. To analyze its biochemical properties, we have overexpressed an oligohistidine-tagged version of the BLMgene product in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and purified the protein to apparent homogeneity using nickel chelate affinity chromatography. The recombinant BLM protein possesses an ATPase activity that is strongly stimulated by either single- or double-stranded DNA. Moreover, BLM exhibits ATP- and Mg2+-dependent DNA helicase activity that displays 3′-5′ directionality. Because many of the mutations in BS individuals are predicted to truncate the BLM protein and thus eliminate the “helicase” motifs or map to conserved positions within these motifs, our data strongly suggest that these mutations will disable the 3′-5′ helicase function of the BLM protein.

Bloom's syndrome (BS) 1The abbreviations used are: BS, Bloom's syndrome; kb, kilobase pair(s); ORF, open reading frame; rBLM, recominant BLM; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; bp, base pair. is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder associated with a variety of phenotypic characteristics, of which the most prominent are pre- and post-natal growth retardation, immunodeficiency, and a sun-sensitive facial erythema. Individuals with BS are strongly predisposed to develop malignancies, including both solid tumors and leukemias. Cells from BS individuals exhibit a number of abnormalities in vitro, the most striking of which is an increase in genomic instability. This is manifested as an elevated frequency of chromosome breaks and exchanges, as well as a characteristic increase in the level of sister-chromatid exchanges (reviewed in Ref. 1German J. Medicine. 1993; 72: 393-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). The gene defective in BS, BLM, was identified recently (2Ellis N.A. Groden J. Ye T.Z. Straughen J. Lennon D.J. Ciocci S.

The mRNA specific for theBLM gene is approximately 4.5 kb in length and encodes a protein with a predicted M r of 159,000. The primary sequence of the BLM protein shows strong similarity to sequences of a subfamily of DEXH box-containing DNA helicases, including RecQ, a 3′-5′ helicase that participates in the RecF pathway of genetic recombination in Escherichia coli(reviewed in Ref. 3Dunderdale H.J. West S.C. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). RecQ has been shown recently to act as a suppressor of illegitimate recombination (4Hanada K. Ukita T.

However, the Sgs1, Rqh1, BLM, and WRN proteins are distinct from RecQ and RECQL in that they are much larger proteins (∼160 versus ∼70 kDa) due to the presence of additional domains flanking the central RecQ homology domain (11Watt P.M.

WRN protein is defective in individuals with Werner's syndrome, a condition with many features of premature aging (reviewed in Ref. 13Thweatt R. Goldstein S. Bioessays. 1993; 15: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Cells from Werner's syndrome individuals are genetically unstable and, in particular, display an increased frequency of gene deletions. Recently, it has been shown that the WRN protein is a DNA helicase, although the direction of the unwinding reaction was not determined (14Suzuki N. Shimamoto A. Imamura O. Kuromitsu J. Kitao S. Goto M. Furuichi Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2973-2978Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). To understand more fully the role of the BLM protein, it will be necessary to characterize its biochemical properties. To achieve this goal, we have developed a yeast-based expression system that permits the preparation of homogeneous BLM protein in reasonable yield. We demonstrate that BLM protein is a DNA-stimulated ATPase and an ATP-dependent DNA helicase. Further, we show that BLM unwinds DNA in the 3′-5′ direction with respect to the strand to which the enzyme is bound. A cDNA comprising the complete open reading frame (ORF) of the BLM gene was generated from a human B-cell library (kindly donated by D. Simmons, Imperial Cancer Research Fund, Oxford) using the polymerase chain reaction. This cDNA was cloned downstream of the GAL1 gene promoter between the BamHI and NotI sites of the yeast expression vector pYES2 (Invitrogen),to give pRKC15. To generate pJK1 for expression of BLM in yeast, the following modifications were made to pRKC15: a C-terminal hexahistidine tag was added, a yeast Kozak consensus sequence was included upstream of the coding sequence, and the first five codons of S. cerevisiae TOP2 gene replaced the initiation codon of the BLM cDNA. To generate the C-terminal modification, the 5′ primer S9 (5′-CTCAAGAAGCTTGCAGAATC-3′) and the 3′ primer JK4 (5′-AGAGAGCTCGAGTCA*GTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGTGAGAATGCATATGAAGGCTT-3′) were used to generate a 0.5-kb fragment of the 3′ end of the BLM ORF. Primer JK4 incorporates a XhoI site (underlined), a stop codon (asterisk), and 18 nucleotides (bold) encoding the hexahistidine tag. A XhoI-HindIII fragment of the above product was used to replace the corresponding section of pRKC15. To generate the N-terminal modification with the inclusion of a yeast Kozak consensus sequence, the 5′ primer JK3 (5′-AGAGAGGGATCCCTAACCATGTCAACTGAACCGGCTGCTGTTCCTCAAAATAAT-3′) and the 3′ primer R2 (5′-TCCTAGGGTGGTAGTCAGTAAACA-3′) were used to generate a 1.4-kb 5′ section of the BLM gene. Primer JK3 has aBamHI site (underlined), a yeast Kozak sequence (TAAAC), and the first five codons of the yeast TOP2 ORF (bold). ABamHI-EcoRI fragment of this product was used to replace the corresponding region in pRKC15. The final construct, pJK1, was sequenced (ABI™ Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing, Perkin-Elmer Corporation) to confirm that the predicted BLM amino acid sequence contained no polymerase chain reaction-induced changes from the BLM sequence published previously (2Ellis N.A. Groden J. Ye T.Z. Straughen J. Lennon D.J. Ciocci S. Proytcheva M. German J. Cell. 1995; 83: 655-666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar). Strain JEL1 (MATα leu2 trp1 ura3–52 prb1–1122 pep4–3 Δhis3::PGAL10-GAL4) (15Austin C.A. Marsh K.L. Wasserman R.A. Willmore E. Sayer P.J. Wang J.C. Fisher L.M. J. Biol.

For induction of BLM protein, galactose was added to a final concentration of 2%, and the cells were cultured for another 24 h at 20 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed in 50 mm sodium phosphate pH 7.0 buffer, and stored at −70 °C until required. Cells were resuspended in an equal volume of 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 500 mm KCl, and 10% glycerol in the presence of an EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Boehringer Mannheim) at 4 °C. Glass beads (425–600 μm, Sigma) were then added to 50% of the volume, and the cells were lysed by vortexing for 10 × 30 s with incubations of 30 s on ice after each burst. To remove solid particles, the lysate was centrifuged at 30,000 × gfor 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was subjected to nickel chelate affinity chromatography under the following conditions: after charging a 1.7-ml Poros 20 MC column (PerSeptive Biosystems) with 50 ml 100 mm NiSO4, it was saturated with 5 bed volumes of 1500 mm imidazole in 50 mm phosphate, pH 7.0, 250 mm NaCl and then equilibrated with 5 bed volumes of 15 mm imidazole in the same buffer. The yeast cell extract was loaded onto the column using a BioCAD workstation (Perseptive Biosystems), and the column was washed with 15 bed volumes of the same buffer containing 50 mm imidazole. Elution was performed with an imidazole gradient of 50–1500 mm in the same buffer applied over 8 bed volumes. Fractions of 1 ml were collected, to which EDTA was added to a final concentration of 10 mm. Fractions containing recombinant BLM (rBLM), as determined by SDS-PAGE, were dialyzed for 16 h against buffer containing 60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and were stored in 25% glycerol at −70 °C. ATPase activity was determined by measuring the release of inorganic phosphate by a colorimetric assay according to Chifflet et al. (16Chifflet S. Torriglia A. Chiesa R. Tolosa S. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 168: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). The assay mixture (50 μl) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 4 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 25 μg/ml sheared salmon sperm DNA, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and unless stated otherwise 50 ng of rBLM protein. After incubation for 30 min at 37 °C, 50 μl of distilled H2O were added, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 μl of 12% SDS. Following this, 200 μl of 0.5% ammonium molybdate/3% ascorbic acid in 6% SDS/0.5 m HCl were added, and the samples were incubated for 5 min at 20 °C. 300 μl of sodium metarsenite, sodium citrate, and acetic acid (all at 2% (w/v)) were added, and after a 10-min incubation at 37 °C, the absorbance of the solution was measured at 850 nm. A substrate with a 91-bp duplex region was created by annealing a 90-mer oligonucleotide to single-stranded M13mp18 DNA and extending the 3′ end by 1 nucleotide using 2 units of Klenow polymerase and 20 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham) for 30 min at 37 °C. Samples were then passed through a Nuctrap probe purification column (Stratagene) to remove unincorporated nucleotides. A substrate with a 38-bp region at the 5′ end and a 55-bp region at the 3′ end was constructed by annealing the 90-mer to single-stranded M13mp18 and digesting it with SalI. All available 3′ ends were labeled using Klenow polymerase, [α-32P]dCTP, and dTTP as described above. For this, the release of a 3′-labeled oligonucleotide annealed to single-stranded M13mp18 was measured. The reaction mixture (20 μl) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 50 mm NaCl, approximately 50 ng of labeled DNA substrate, and 50 ng of rBLM protein. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, the samples were run on a 12 or 15% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel at 20 °C. The gel was dried and exposed to x-ray film (Kodak X-Omat). The amount of substrate displaced was determined by scanning the autoradiograms using a PhosphorImager 425 (Molecular Dynamics) and ImageQuant software. The protein extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 8 or 10% gels followed by electrotransfer of the proteins to nitrocellulose (Hybond-C super, Amersham). rBLM protein was detected by a mouse monoclonal anti-histidine tag antibody (Dianova). Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using ECL reagents (Amersham). To overexpress rBLM protein in S. cerevisiae, a full-length BLMcDNA was generated using the polymerase chain reaction (see “Experimental Procedures”). The predicted amino acid sequence of the BLM protein was shown to be identical to that published by Elliset al. (2Ellis N.A. Groden J. Ye T.Z. Straughen J. Lennon D.J. Ciocci S. Proytcheva M. German J. Cell. 1995; 83: 655-666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar), although the nucleotide sequence contained six silent changes, four of which probably represent polymorphisms, because they were found in an independently generated cDNA (data not shown). Two modifications were made to the cDNA to facilitate the subsequent purification of the BLM gene product. First, a hexahistidine affinity tag was engineered at the 3′ end of the coding sequence to permit the expressed protein both to be detected by means of specific anti-histidine tag antibodies and to be purified on nickel-chelate resin. Second, the first 5 codons of the yeastTOP2 gene were placed immediately upstream of the completeBLM open reading frame. In previous studies it was shown that the presence of these yeast Top2p-derived amino acids improved the yield of expressed recombinant human proteins (15Austin C.A. Marsh K.L. Wasserman R.A.

Wang J.C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3591-3596PubMed Google Scholar). The modifiedBLM cDNA was cloned downstream of the GAL1promoter in vector pYES2 by insertion between the vector'sBamHI and XhoI sites to generate pJK1. The pJK1 construct was transformed into the Gal+, protease-deficient S. cerevisiae host strain JEL1, and expression of the rBLM protein was induced through activating the GAL1 promoter by the addition of galactose to the growth medium. The overexpressed rBLM protein was then purified to apparent homogeneity by nickel-chelate affinity chromatography. Peak fractions represent an imidazole concentration of 100–350 mm. The purified protein had an apparent M r on SDS-PAGE of 180,000 (Fig.1 A). In a typical preparation, approximately 50 μg of pure rBLM protein were obtained per liter of yeast culture. To verify that the purified protein was rBLM, Western blotting studies were performed. Fig. 1 B shows that a specific anti-histidine tag antibody reacted both with a single 180-kDa species in crude lysates of galactose-treated JEL1/pJK1 cells and with the purified rBLM protein. This protein was not detected in JEL1/pJK1 cells prior to activation of the GAL1 promoter (data not shown). Moreover, affinity purified anti-BLM antibodies raised in rabbits to a small portion of the N-terminal domain of BLM expressed in E. coli(to be described elsewhere) recognized the same 180-kDa species (data not shown). The presence of the characteristic “Walker Box” motifs in the primary sequence of BLM (2Ellis N.A. Groden J. Ye T.Z. Straughen J. Lennon D.J. Ciocci S. Proytcheva M. German J. Cell. 1995; 83: 655-666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar) predicts that the protein would be an ATPase. The ability of the rBLM protein to hydrolyze ATP was therefore examined. Fig.2 shows that the BLM protein was associated with an ATPase activity that was strongly stimulated by the presence of DNA. The ATPase reaction catalyzed by rBLM was linear during a 60-min incubation period (data not shown), and the specific activity of the rBLM protein as an ATPase using native salmon sperm DNA as a co-factor was calculated to be 10,000 units/mg (where 1 unit hydrolyzes 1 nmol ATP/min). All forms of single- and double-stranded DNA tested gave a broadly similar level of stimulation (Fig. 2). Nevertheless, a short (17-mer) single-stranded oligomer was consistently less efficient as a co-factor than was a longer (90-mer) oligonucleotide (compare bars 1 and 2 on Fig.2). To confirm that the ATPase activity was associated directly with the rBLM protein, individual fractions from a nickel-chelate chromatography elution were both assayed for ATPase activity and subjected to SDS-PAGE to quantify the level of BLM protein in each fraction. Fig.3 shows that there was a strong concordance between the level of ATPase activity and the quantity of rBLM protein in each fraction, confirming that the activity was an intrinsic property of the BLM protein. The E. coli RecQ protein is a 3′-5′ DNA helicase (18Umezu K. Nakayama K. Nakayama H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5363-5367Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). BLM, like RecQ, contains the seven consensus amino acid motifs conserved in the DEXH box-containing subfamily of helicases, suggesting that BLM would also be a DNA helicase. To analyze whether the purified rBLM protein possesses helicase activity, a partially double-stranded substrate was prepared comprising single-stranded M13 viral form DNA annealed to a radiolabeled 91-mer oligonucleotide (Fig.4 A). This substrate was incubated with the purified rBLM protein, and the reaction products were separated on a polyacrylamide gel. The labeled oligonucleotide was then detected by autoradiography. Fig. 4 B shows that rBLM possesses a DNA unwinding activity that is dependent upon the presence of both Mg2+ and ATP and that could be destroyed by incubating the rBLM preparation at 65 °C for 10 min. To determine the polarity of DNA unwinding by the BLM helicase, a substrate comprising a 90-mer oligonucleotide annealed to single-stranded M13 DNA was prepared. This partial duplex DNA was digested with SalI and radiolabeled at all available 3′ ends using Klenow polymerase and [α-32P]dCTP to generate a linear DNA molecule with 38- and 55-mer double-stranded portions at its termini (Fig. 4 C). In this substrate, the 55-bp oligomer was consistently preferentially labeled compared with the 38-mer, as can be seen in lane 1 of Fig. 4 D following heat denaturation of the double-stranded substrate. Following incubation of the substrate with the rBLM protein, no increase in the amount of unwound 55-mer oligonucleotide over background was observed (comparelanes 2 and 3, Fig. 4 D). In contrast, complete release of the 38-mer oligonucleotide was evident, indicating that the direction of DNA unwinding catalyzed by the BLM protein was 3′-5′ with respect to the strand to which the enzyme was bound. Consistent with the ATPase data described above, the helicase activity of rBLM was completely dependent upon Mg2+ and ATP (Fig.4 D, lanes 4 and 5). We have purified to near homogeneity the product of the gene mutated in BS and demonstrated that the BLM protein is a DNA-stimulated ATPase and an ATP-dependent DNA helicase that unwinds DNA in a 3′-5′ direction. DNA helicases differ from other helix-destabilizing enzymes in their ability to unwind DNA substrates irrespective of their length. Consistent with BLM acting as a bona fide DNA helicase, we have shown that rBLM can unwind both an 18-mer and a 91-mer substrate with similar efficiencies (Fig. 4 and data not shown). The purified rBLM protein exhibits an ATPase activity that is strongly stimulated by the presence of DNA. Because both circular M13 viral form DNA and plasmid DNA were effective as co-factors in this reaction, there is clearly no requirement for BLM to interact with free DNA ends in order for its ATPase activity to be stimulated. The relatively modest increase in ATPase activity seen in reactions containing high molecular weight single-stranded DNAs compared with those containing an 17-mer oligonucleotide might indicate that the optimal length of DNA for interaction with BLM is greater that 17 nucleotides. This can now be tested. The available evidence indicates that the members of the RecQ subfamily of DEXH box-containing enzymes utilize a 3′-5′ DNA helicase activity to perform critical roles in DNA metabolism (11Watt P.M. Hickson I.D. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 265-267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 12Lombard D.B. Guarente L.

Although the precise role of these enzymes has yet to be determined in any organism, in every case studied to date lack of a RecQ family helicase leads to some form of genomic instability. Moreover, emerging evidence suggests that abnormalities in recombination underly this instability. Because many of the mutations at the BLM locus that are associated with BS are predicted to eliminate the function of one or more of the helicase motifs (2Ellis N.A. Groden J. Ye T.Z. Straughen J. Lennon D.J. Ciocci S. Proytcheva M. German J. Cell. 1995; 83: 655-666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar), we suggest that the 3′-5′ helicase activity of the BLM protein is required for the BLM protein to suppress inappropriate recombination. It will be interesting to test whether the particular BLM gene mutations found in BS individuals, both those mapping within the helicase motifs and those lying outside the RecQ homology domain, inactivate the helicase function of the protein. This will be an important indication as to whether the N- and C-terminal domains of BLM are important for catalysis or for conferring other functions on the protein, such as an ability to interact with a unique set of cellular proteins. In this regard it is also interesting to note that the major differences between the sequences of the BLM and WRN (Werner's syndrome) proteins are found outside of the RecQ homology domain (2Ellis N.A. Groden J. Ye T.Z. Straughen J. Lennon D.J. Ciocci S. Proytcheva M. German J. Cell. 1995; 83: 655-666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar, 10Yu C. Oshima J. Fu Y. Wijsman E.M.

Science. 1996; 272: 258-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1496) Google Scholar), suggesting that the unique N- and C-terminal domains of the proteins confer at least some of the functional differences between BLM and WRN (19Ellis N.A. Nature. 1996; 381: 110-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Sgs1p, the S. cerevisiae homolog of BLM, apparently performs a very similar role in budding yeast to that of BLM in human cells. In support of this contention, sgs1Δ strains show a spontaneous hyperrecombination phenotype (5Gangloff S. McDonald J.P. Bendixen C. Arthur L. Rothstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8391-8398Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar, 20Watt P.M. Hickson I.D. Borts R.H. Louis E.J. Genetics. 1996; 144: 935-945Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reminiscent of that ofBLM-deficient cell lines. The cellular functions of Sgs1p are intimately connected with those of the three topoisomerases expressed by budding yeast. SGS1 interacts genetically withTOP1 (21Lu J. Mullen J.R. Brill S.J. Kleff S. Romeo A.M. Sternglanz R. Nature. 1996; 383: 678-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and TOP3 (5Gangloff S. McDonald J.P. Bendixen C. Arthur L. Rothstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8391-8398Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar), and Sgs1p associates physically with Top2p (6Watt P.M. Louis E.J. Borts R.H. Hickson I.D. Cell. 1995; 81: 253-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) and Top3p (5Gangloff S. McDonald J.P. Bendixen C. Arthur L. Rothstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8391-8398Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). Considering the high level of sequence conservation among eukaryotes for these proteins, it seems likely that some, if not all, of these interactions will be conserved in human cells. As a result of the purification of BLM protein reported here, we are now in a position to analyze whether a physical interaction occurs between BLM and purified topoisomerases IIα, IIβ, or III, the human homologs of Top2p and Top3p. It would appear that helicases and topoisomerases might co-operate to perform many different important roles in eukaryotic DNA metabolism (reviewed in Ref. 22Duguet M. J. Cell. Sci. 1997; 110: 1345-1350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among the numerous possibilities for such co-operation are; (i) to facilitate replication fork progression and/or the segregation of newly replicated daughter DNA molecules, (ii) to manipulate chromosome functions via the modification of nucleosomal structure and/or DNA topology, (iii) to promote recombination through branch migration or to suppress recombination by actively disrupting inappropriate recombinant intermediates. The challenge is now to provide experimental evidence in favor of one or more of these putative roles.

Recently, a naturally occurring mutation of CCR5, ccr5Δ32, has been described. A small number of Caucasians are homozygouslyccr5Δ32/ccr5Δ32, while a larger number of individuals are heterozygously CCR5/ccr5Δ32. Theccr5Δ32/ccr5Δ32 genotype has been linked to a phenotype that is “highly” protected from HIV-1 infection. On the other hand, several studies have shown that the CCR5/ccr5Δ32 genotype confers “relative” protection from AIDS with onset of disease being delayed by 2–4 years. Although it is known that peripheral blood lymphocytes from heterozygous individuals (CCR5/ccr5Δ32) support ex vivo HIV-1 replication at a reduced level compared with CCR5/CCR5 cells, the molecular basis for this observation is unknown. Here we report on events that post-translationally modify CCR5. We show that CCR5 progresses through the endoplasmic reticulum prior to appearing on the cell surface. Mature CCR5 can be post-translationally modified by phosphorylation and/or co-translationally by multimerization. By contrast, mutant ccr5Δ32, although retaining the capacity for multimerization, was incapable of being phosphorylated. ccr5Δ32 heterocomplexes with CCR5, and this interaction retains CCR5 in the endoplasmic reticulum resulting in reduced cell surface expression. Thus, co-expression in cells of ccr5Δ32 with CCR5 produces a trans-inhibition by the former of ability by the latter to support HIV-1 infection. Taken together, our findings suggest CCR5/ccr5Δ32 heterodimerization as a molecular explanation for the delayed onset of AIDS inCCR5/ccr5Δ32 individuals.

Weiss R.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 230-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Chemokine receptors belong to the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors that have seven transmembrane domains. Chemokines are a family of small proteins (7–16 kDa) that can be operationally divided in two subgroups. The α subfamily (CXC) is distinguished from the β subfamily (CC) by the insertion of a single amino acid between the first and the second cysteine residues. The binding of chemokines to their receptors induces a rapid calcium influx and inflammatory responses (2Murphy P.M.

Based on the finding that chemokines (CC-β) RANTES, MIP-1α, and MIP-1β inhibit infection by macrophage-tropic (M-tropic) HIV-1 isolates (6Cocchi F. DeVico A.L. Garzino-Demo A. Arya S.K. Gallo R.C.

Accordingly, further investigations have demonstrated the existence, in some ethnic groups (e.g. Caucasians), of a natural genetic mutation inCCR5 (ccr5Δ32, an internal 32-nucleotide deletion in the CCR5 open reading frame). Homozygousccr5Δ32/ccr5Δ32 genotype confers resistance to HIV-1 infection in vitro and in vivo (12Liu R. Paxton W.A. Choe S. Ceradini D. Martin S.R. Horuk R. MacDonald M.E. Stuhlmann H. Koup R.A.

However, the incidence of homozygocity in Caucasians is low (1%), while heterozygous (CCR5/ccr5Δ32) individuals exist more prevalently (up to 20% in some populations). There is evidence that CCR5/ccr5Δ32 heterozygotes progress more slowly to AIDS (13Dean M. Carrington M. Winkler C. Huttley G.A. Smith M.W. Allikmets R. Goedert J.J. Buchbinder S.P. Vittinghoff E.

Currently, how heterozygocity (CCR5/ccr5Δ32) mechanistically impacts disease progression is unknown. It has, however, been observed thatCCR5/ccr5Δ32 PBMCs are less infectible in vitroby M-tropic HIV-1s than CCR5/CCR5 cells (12Liu R. Paxton W.A. Choe S. Ceradini D. Martin S.R. Horuk R. MacDonald M.E. Stuhlmann H. Koup R.A. Landau N.R. Cell. 1996; 86: 367-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2582) Google Scholar). Although the level of cell surface expression of CCR5 in the uninfected population is quite heterogeneous, varying up to 20-fold between individuals (17Moore J.P. Science. 1997; 276: 51-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), one study has found that CCR5/ccr5Δ32 T-cells are markedly reduced for surface expression of CCR5 compared withCCR5/CCR5 counterparts (18Wu B.L. Paxton W.A. Kassam N. Ruffing N. Rottman J.B. Sullivan N. Choe H. Sodroski J. Newman W. Koup R.A. Mackay C.R. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1681-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). Accordingly, a correlation between surface CCR5 expression and infectibility by M-tropic HIV-1s is suggested (18Wu B.L. Paxton W.A. Kassam N. Ruffing N. Rottman J.B. Sullivan N. Choe H. Sodroski J. Newman W. Koup R.A. Mackay C.R. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1681-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). The mechanism through which ccr5Δ32 might affect CCR5-function remains to be clarified. To assess this issue we studied the effect of ccr5Δ32 on the processing, stability, and cell surface expression of CCR5. We found that 1) CCR5 is post-translationally phosphorylated upon MIP-1β stimulation of cells; 2) intracellularly, CCR5 exists as either CCR5/CCR5 or CCR5/ccr5Δ32 multimers; 3) CCR5 and ccr5Δ32 are found in different cellular locales (the former is predominantly on the cell surface while the latter is retained in the ER); and 4) co-expression of ccr5Δ32 inhibited surface expression of CCR5 and CCR5-mediated infection by M-tropic HIV-1 isolates. All constructs were derived from pCCR5 (5Feng Y. Broder C.C. Kennedy P.E. Berger E.A. Science. 1996; 272: 872-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (3643) Google Scholar). CCR5 mutants, cloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), include pCMV/CCR5Δcyt (aa 1–303), pCMV/CCR5/6TM (aa 1–279), pCMV/CCR5/5TM (aa 1–235), and pCMV/CCR5Δ32 (aa 1–187). Each mutant was generated by polymerase chain reaction with the HA epitope fused to each cDNA at the 3′ terminus. pCMVCCR5-Flag was a gift from Ron Willey (National Institutes of Health). HeLa cells were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum. PBMCs were activated for 3 days in RPMI with 10% fetal bovine serum containing PHA and then washed and resuspended into the same medium without PHA and with 100 units/ml interleukin-2 (Boehringer Mannheim). PBMCs were exposed to M-tropic HIV-1 isolate AD8 (500 units of TCID50) for 1 h at 37 °C, washed, and then resuspended into fresh medium. Virus replication was monitored by reverse transcriptase assay as described previously (19Huang L. Joshi A. Willey R. Ornstein J. Jeang K.-T. EMBO. J. 1994; 13: 2886-2896Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Transfection of HeLa cells was performed using calcium phosphate. 24 h after transfection, cells were washed twice in DMEM without methionine and cysteine starved for 30 min in the same medium at 37 °C. [35S]Methionine + cysteine (translabel ICN) at 1 mCi/ml final concentration was added to the cells. The cells were then incubated at 37 °C for the indicated amount of pulse time and then washed and resuspended in DMEM with methionine and cysteine for the indicated chase times. For immunoprecipitation, identical protein amounts were suspended into 1 ml of Triton lysis buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 300 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with either anti-Flag M2 (Eastman Kodak Co.) or anti-HA (12CA5, Boehringer Mannheim). A mixture of protein A- and protein G-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) was added to each sample followed by a 1-h incubation at 4 °C. Three washes were performed in Triton wash buffer (0.1% Triton X-100, 300 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and a final wash in SDS/deoxycholate buffer (300 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% deoxycholate). The immunoprecipitated products were solubilized in 1 × loading buffer (125 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 2% SDS, 2% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.01% bromphenol blue) and resolved by SDS-PAGE. HeLa cells were seeded onto coverslips and transfected. 24 h later, cells were fixed with fresh 4% paraformaldehyde, pH 7.0, for 10 min at room temperature. Fixed cells were permeabilized with a 2-min wash in 100% methanol at room temperature followed by several washes in PBS with 4% bovine serum albumin (PBS/BSA). Appropriately diluted primary antibody was incubated with coverslips overnight at 4 °C. Excess antibody was removed with four washes in PBS/BSA. Species-specific second antibody conjugated to Texas Red (Cappel) was then reacted with the coverslips for 1 h at room temperature followed with four washes in PBS/BSA. The final samples were mounted onto slides and visualized using a Ziess Axiophot confocal microscope. Two-hybrid assays were performed according to manufacturer's protocols (CLONTECH). To ask whether CCR5 forms an oligomer, HeLa cells were transfected with pCMV/CCR5-Flag, which contains the Flag epitope fused to the C terminus of CCR5. 24 h later, cells were pulsed with [35S]methionine + cysteine for 15 min, washed, and then chased in complete medium for 1 h. Extracts prepared from pulsed and pulsed + chased cells were immunoprecipitated using anti-Flag M2. The immunoprecipitates were resuspended into either 1 × loading buffer (Fig. 1 A, lanes 1 and2) or “native” loading buffer without β-mercaptoethanol with a reduced amount of SDS (0.25%) (Fig.1 A, lanes 3 and 4). The samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE. The reduced mobility of CCR5 in the pulsed + chased sample (Fig. 1 A, lane 2) when compared with the pulsed sample (Fig.1 A, lane 1) is consistent with a post-translational modification. 2R. Willey, unpublished observation. When the same analysis was repeated using native loading buffer (Fig. 1 A, lanes 3 and 4), the mobility difference observed for pulsed (lane 3) and pulsed + chased (lane 4) samples was replicated. The native buffer-PAGE revealed additional CCR5-specific bands with sizes consistent with dimeric moieties (d; Fig.1 A, lanes 3 and 4). To characterize better multimerization potentials, we analyzed CCR5 using the yeast two-hybrid approach (TableI). In this analysis, C-terminal truncation mutants of CCR5 were found to interact with wild type CCR5. However, a mutant deleted in the first 58 amino acids failed to interact with intact CCR5. Thus, in yeasts, the CCR5-CCR5 interactive domain resides in the N-terminal portion of the protein, which encompasses the first transmembrane region.Table IYeast two-hybrid analysis of CCR5/CCR5 interactionCCR5 (1–352)TaxCCR5 (1–352)+++−CCR5Δcyt (1–303)+++−CCR5/6TM (1–279)+++−CCR5/5TM (1–235)+++−CCR5/4TM (ccr5Δ32) (1–187)+++−CCR5Δnt (58–352)−−Tax−++++Yeast were transformed by PIDCCR5wt and the different mutants using LiAc method of Gietz et al.

We co-expressed CCR5 and ccr5Δ32 in HeLa CD4+/LTR-βgal cells and assayed for cell fusion engendered by an M-tropic HIV-1 isolate, HIV-1AD8 (20Theodore T. England G. Buckler-White A. Buckler C.E. Martin M.A. Peden K.W. AIDS Res. Hum. Retrovirus. 1996; 12: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). A prediction of protein dimerization is that ccr5Δ32 could be a dominant negative inhibitor of CCR5 function. We found that transfection of HeLa CD4+ LTR-CAT with wild type CCR5 (Fig.2 A) did render, as expected, HeLa cells susceptible to HIV-1AD8 infection (Fig.2 A, compare lane 8 with 9). Co-transfection of CCR5 with ccr5Δcyt (CCR5 lacking the cytoplasmic tail) did not affect HIV-1AD8 infection (Fig. 2 A, lane 10). However, co-expression of CCR5 with either ccr5/6TM, or ccr5/5TM, or ccr5/4TM (ccr5Δ32) or ccr5/3TM (i.e.C-terminal mutants deleted for six, five, four, or three transmembrane regions, respectively) dramatically reduced the ability of cells to support HIV-1AD8-induced fusion. No effect was seen when pNL4–3 (T-tropic HIV-1) infections were conducted under parallel conditions (Fig. 2 A, lanes 1–7), confirming M-tropic specificity of CCR5 in these experiments. Co-expression of ccrΔ32 and CCR5 in monolayer cells can be regarded as an artificial approach modeling in vivo infection. To construct a more physiological test, we conducted infections comparing PBMCs from oneCCR5/CCR5 and two CCR5/ccr5Δ32 individuals. These results (Fig. 2 B) are consistent with the above findings (Fig. 2 A) and previously published results (12Liu R. Paxton W.A. Choe S. Ceradini D. Martin S.R. Horuk R. MacDonald M.E. Stuhlmann H. Koup R.A. Landau N.R. Cell. 1996; 86: 367-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2582) Google Scholar), confirming that simultaneous presence of ccr5Δ32 with CCR5 in the same cell reduces susceptibility to infection by M-tropic HIV-1. The infection results led us to consider how ccr5Δ32 might affect thein vivo presentation of CCR5. To address this question, we used confocal immunofluorescence to visualize potential intracellular influences of ccr5Δ32 on CCR5. Upon staining with specific antiserum, steady-state CCR5 and ccr5Δ32 were found in distinctly different subcellular locales. While CCR5 was found on cell surfaces (Fig.3 A), ccr5Δ32 stained in the ER (Fig. 3 B). ER localization was observed for all ccr5 mutants (ccr5/6TM, ccr5/5TM, ccr5/4TM, and ccr5/3TM), except ccr5Δcyt, which was found on the cell surface (data not shown). When CCR5 and ccr5Δ32 were co-expressed in the same cell, significantly reduced surface staining of the former was seen (Fig.3 C). The above findings are consistent with CCR5-CCR5 dimers. The biochemical evidence provided by mobility shifts in PAGE (Fig. 1, compare lanes 1 and 2) could also be explained by other modifying events such as phosphorylation. Because the C terminus of CCR5 is rich in serine and threonine residues, which are potential substrate sites for G protein-coupled receptor-kinase(s), and because phosphorylation could conceivably influence overall receptor function, we queried for this possibility. We, thus, transfected HeLa cells with pCMV/CCR5-Flag and labeled the cells in parallel with either [35S]methionine + cysteine (Fig.4 A, lanes 1–4) or [32P]orthophosphate (Fig. 4 A, lanes 5–8) for 2 h in the absence (Fig. 4 A, lanes 1, 3, 5, and7) or presence (Fig. 4 A, lanes 2, 4, 6, and8) of 100 ng/ml of MIP-1β. Cell extracts normalized for radioactivity were then immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibody. In the immunoprecipitates, the amount of 35S-labeled CCR5 was found to be equivalent between mock-treated and cells treated with MIP-1β (Fig. 4 A, compare lane 1 with lane 2 and lane 3 with lane 4). However, in the same experiment, a large difference in 32P-labeled CCR5 in the presence of MIP-1β was observed (Fig. 4 A, comparelane 5 with lane 6 and lane 7 withlane 8). These results suggest that MIP-1β does not affect the ambient expression of CCR5, but does affect the phosphorylation state of this protein. The cytoplasmic tail of CCR5 is rich in potential phosphate acceptor sites. To examine the contribution of this portion of the protein to phosphorylation, HeLa cells were transfected with pCMV/CCR5Δcyt. This construction encodes a truncated form of CCR5 lacking the cytoplasmic tail fused at its C terminus to a HA epitope. In this instance, the experiment was performed as that described in the legend to Fig.4 A except that anti-HA was used for immunoprecipitation. As shown in Fig. 4 B, similar amounts of 35S-labeled CCR5Δcyt was found in mock-treated and cells treated with MIP-1β (compare lane 1 with lane 2). However, we failed to detect any 32P-labeled CCR5Δcyt (Fig. 4 B, lanes 3 and 4). These results suggest that an intact cytoplasmic tail of CCR5 is essential for phosphorylation. In summary, our study raises three points: 1) functional CCR5 molecule exists as a multimer; 2) expression of ccr5Δ32 reduces cell surface expression of wild type CCR5; and 3) MIP-1β induces the phosphorylation of CCR5 in its cytoplasmic tail. Taken together, these points suggest that there are complex post-translational regulatory events for CCR5. Relevant to the observation of receptor multimerization, it is clear that CCR5 mutants such as ccr5Δ32 are defective in some specific aspects of post-translational processing that render them aberrantly trapped in the ER (see Fig. 3). However, these defective mutants, nevertheless, maintain an ability to multimerize with wild type CCR5 and through this heterocomplexing retains the wild type moiety into the ER. We believe that this mutant-wild type tethering mechanism explains, in part, why PBMCs from CCR5/ccr5Δ32 individuals have lower levels of cell surface CCR5 when compared with CCR5/CCR5 counterparts (18Wu B.L. Paxton W.A. Kassam N. Ruffing N. Rottman J.B. Sullivan N. Choe H. Sodroski J. Newman W. Koup R.A. Mackay C.R. J. Exp.

Likely, this modification governs a step in transducing the MIP-1β signal from the cell surface into the cytoplasm/nucleus. Recently, Amaraet al. (21Amara A. Le Gall S. Schwartz O. Salamero J. Montes M. Loetscher P. Baggiolini M. Virelizier J.L. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar) reported that internalization of chemokine receptors (CXCR4 and CCR5), induced by their ligand, contribute to chemokines-mediated inhibition of HIV-1 replication. Interestingly, the cytoplasmic tail of CXCR4 is required for SDF-1-mediated internalization of CXCR4 (21Amara A. Le Gall S. Schwartz O. Salamero J. Montes M. Loetscher P. Baggiolini M. Virelizier J.L. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Whether phosphorylation of chemokine receptors influences ligand-induced internalization is unknown. Another possibility is that chemokine-stimulated CCR5 phosphorylation can exert entry-unrelated effects that ameliorate HIV-1 infection. Indeed, MIP-1β, MIP-1α, and RANTES have been shown to have unexpected effects on HIV-1 replication in macrophages (22Schmidtmayerova H. Sherry B. Burkinsky M. Nature. 1996; 382: 767Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). We note that there now exists a plethora of co-receptors for HIV-1 (at least six different ones have been reported; reviewed in Ref. 1Clapham P.R. Weiss R.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 230-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), suggesting that ligand-based inhibition of HIV-1 infection would be difficult (23McKnight A. Wilkinson D. Simmons G. Talbot S. Picard L. Ahuja M. Marsh M. Hoxie J.A. Clapham P.R. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1692-1696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We note additionally that a protective effect to a CCR2 mutation has been recently described (24Smith M.W. Dean M. Carrington M. Winkler C. Huttley G.A. Lomb D.A. Goedert J.J. O'Brien T.R.

Science. 1997; 277: 959-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). Whether the CCR2 mutation shares functional similarities with the CCR5 Δ32 mutation (e.g. producing nonproductive transdominant multimerization or affecting phosphorylation) remains to be explored. However, the natural existence of transdominant negative chemokine receptor mutants might be a general principle that explains differential resistance of certain subpopulations for AIDS and that might help guide future intervention strategies for HIV-1.

Later it was discovered that this protein indeed acts as a peroxidase but requires thioredoxin or a thiol-containing intermediate to carry on its peroxidase function (3Chae H.Z. Chung S.J. Rhee S.G.

The gene encoding TPx 1The abbreviations used are: TPx, thioredoxin peroxidase; NKEF, natural killer enhancing factor; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase; FBS, fetal bovine serum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline.

Immumogenetics. 1994; 40: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). NKEF is a cytosolic factor found in human red blood cells and thought to be a major antioxidant protecting red blood cells from oxidative injury (6Shau H. Gupta R.K. Golub S.H. Cell.

The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae thioredoxin peroxidase has been demonstrated to have hydrogen peroxidase function, to act by dimerization as a thio-specific antioxidant, and to increase 2–3-fold by Western blot determination when S. cerevisiae cells undergo oxidative stress, suggesting that it is of physiological importance (8Chae H.Z.

Apoptosis is known to be induced by oxidative damage either from oxygen free radicals or hydrogen peroxide directly or from their generation in cells by injurious agents (9Sarafian T.A. Bredesen D.E.

Catalase and superoxide dismutase have also been extensively demonstrated to protect cells from different inducers of apoptosis, again suggesting a role for oxidation products in regulating cell death (15Sandstrom P.A.

These considerations prompted us to investigate whether thioredoxin peroxidase could also function as an inhibitor of apoptosis. Molt-4 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37 °C in an environment containing 5% CO2 and 95% air. Monoclonal anti-cytochrome cantibody was purchased from Pharmagen. Polyclonal antibody against TPx II was prepared as described (3Chae H.Z. Chung S.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27670-27678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 2,7-Dichloro-fluorescin diacetate was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Etoposide was obtained from Sigma. Molt-4 cells (3 × 107/ml) were transfected by electroporation with PCRTM 3.1-Uni vector (Invitrogen) with and without full-length TPx II DNA (10 μg) (17Chae H,Z. Robison K. Poole L.B. Church G. Storz G. Rhee S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7017-7021Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). A heterogeneous population of positive clones was selected with G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) and maintained in RPMI 1640 containing 10% FBS, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 0.5 mg/ml of G418. To determine the expression of TPx II, whole cell extracts (10 μg/lane) were separated on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, Western blotted with the polyclonal anti-TPx II antibody, and visualized with the ECL reagents (Amersham) as described (3Chae H.Z. Chung S.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27670-27678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For serum deprivation experiments, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and once with serum free RPMI 1640 containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. Washed cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 105/ml in serum free RPMI 1640 containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. To study the effects of ceramide, etoposide, or H2O2, cells were washed once and seeded (at a density of 5 × 105/ml) with RPMI 1640 containing 2% FBS and 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. Control cells were treated with appropriate amounts of vehicle (ethanol for ceramide and Me2SO for etoposide) diluted in the same culture medium as that for the drugs. At desired timed intervals, aliquots of cells were removed for various assays. Cell viability was assessed by trypan blue exclusion. Cells (5 × 106) were pelleted by centrifugation, rinsed once with ice-cold PBS, resuspended in 100 μl of PBS containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmEGTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, diluted with 5 × SDS sample buffer, and boiled for 10 min. Intact and cleaved PARP were detected by Western blot as described (18Smyth M.J. Perry D.K. Zhang J. Poirier G.G. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. Biochem.

Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and resuspended in 100 μl of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, containing 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 250 mmsucrose. Cytosol was prepared, and the levels of cytosolic cytochromec were determined by Western blot exactly as described (19Yang J. Liu X.S. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J.Y. Peng T.I. Jones D.P. Wang X.D. Science. 1997; 275: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4422) Google Scholar) using a monoclonal anti-cytochrome c antibody from PharMingen (San Diego, CA). Cells (5 × 106) were washed twice with PBS and lysed by three cycles of repeated freezing and thaw in 300 μl of 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. The amounts of representative lipid peroxide, malonaldehyde, were determined spectrophotometrically with a kit from Calbiochem exactly as described by the manufacturer and normalized to total protein, determined by the Bio-Rad dye binding assay using bovine serum albumin as standard. Cellular H2O2 was determined following a protocol described by Hockenbery et al. (20Hockenbery D.M. Oltvai Z.N. Yin X.M. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 241-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3297) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (5 × 106) were loaded with vehicle Me2SO (0.05%) or 50 μm 2,7-dichloro-fluorescin diacetate for 1 h at 37 °C. Afterward, cells were treated with H2O2 (80 μm). At the indicated time, cells were washed twice and resuspended in 5 ml of PBS buffer. Cells were analyzed using a Becton Dickson fluorophotometer with excitation and emission wavelength settings of 495 and 525 nm, respectively. We stably transfected Molt-4 leukemia cells with vector control or cDNA encoding the mammalian thioredoxin peroxidase protein TPx II. After selection for stable transfectants, we demonstrated the overexpression of TPx II protein using Western blot analysis (Fig.1). We next evaluated the cells for their sensitivity to inducers of apoptosis. The cells overexpressing TPx II were resistant to a variety of inducers of apoptosis. Fig.2 A demonstrates that vector-transfected cells were ∼25 and ∼40% dead by 24 and 48 h following serum deprivation, respectively, whereas cells overexpressing TPx II were significantly resistant to death in response to serum deprivation. Similarly, vector-transfected cells were easily induced to undergo cell death in response to other well known inducers of apoptosis such as ceramide treatment (Fig. 2 B), whereas TPx II again protected cells from ceramide-induced cell death. We also tested the ability of TPx II to protect from apoptosis in response to the pharmacologic agent, etoposide, a chemotherapeutic agent that has been demonstrated to induce cell death by apoptosis (21Kaufmann S. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 5870-5878PubMed Google Scholar). TPx II, but not vector control, protected cells from undergoing cell death in response to etoposide treatment (Fig. 2 C). Bcl-2 has been well documented to protect cells from apoptosis (13Hockenbery D. Nunez G. Milliman C. Schreiber R.D. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1990; 348: 334-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (3544) Google Scholar). As Fig.2 D demonstrates, Bcl-2 was as effective as TPx II at protecting cells from ceramide-induced apoptosis. To confirm that cell death in response to these inducers was occurring by apoptosis, we evaluated the ability of these inducers to cleave the death substrate PARP (22Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Ottaviano Y. Davidson N.E. Poirier G.G. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3976-3985PubMed Google Scholar). TPx II, but not control vector, inhibited PARP cleavage in response to up to 72 h of serum deprivation as well as in response to ceramide treatment (Fig. 2 E). These studies demonstrate that TPx II inhibits apoptosis, and it appears to be as effective as Bcl-2.Figure 2Effect of TPx on apoptosis and PARP cleavage. TPx II protects cells from apoptosis in response to serum deprivation (A), C6-ceramide (20 μm) (B), or etoposide (40 μm) (C); Bcl-2 protects cells from apoptosis induced by ceramide (20 μm) (D). All treatments were for the indicated times.

Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4484) Google Scholar). Cytochrome c appears to be released from the mitochondria into the cytosol in response to several apoptotic stimuli. Bcl-2 has recently been demonstrated to block cytochrome c release and consequently rescues cells from activation of the caspases and cell death (19Yang J. Liu X.S. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M.

Science. 1997; 275: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (4289) Google Scholar). Up to this point of evaluation, TPx II appeared to act similar to Bcl-2 in protecting cells from apoptosis; however, it was unclear if TPx II functioned upstream, downstream, or at the same site as Bcl-2 in the apoptotic pathway. Therefore, in an attempt to order thioredoxin peroxidase in the apoptotic pathway with respect to Bcl-2, we next evaluated its ability to modulate cytochromec translocation. Cytochrome c release into the cytosol was evaluated in cells that overexpress Bcl-2 as well as cells that overexpress TPx II. We first evaluated if the cell-permeable ceramide analog C6-ceramide is able to induce cytochromec release into the cytosol, because ceramide has been demonstrated to function upstream of Bcl-2 in the apoptotic pathway (25Zhang J. Alter N. Reed J.C. Borner C. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5325-5328Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The addition of C6-ceramide (20 μm) resulted in release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytosol seen as early as 2 h. Importantly, Bcl-2, protected cells from cytochrome c release in response to ceramide (Fig.3 A). Interestingly, TPx II also protected cells as effectively as Bcl-2 from cytochromec release (Fig. 3 B). We also assayed cytochromec release in response to the chemotherapeutic agent etoposide, and the results show that TPx II (Fig. 3 D) was as effective as Bcl-2 (Fig. 3 C) in protecting cells from cytochrome c release. Because release of cytochromec is considered an early event in the commitment to apoptosis, this shows that TPx II functions similar to Bcl-2 in this phase. To further understand the mechanism by which TPx II inhibits apoptosis and to compare this with Bcl-2, we next evaluated the effects of TPx II on lipid peroxidation, given the biochemical function of TPx II as a peroxidase. Lipid peroxidation has been implicated as an intermediate in the apoptotic pathway that is thought to precede DNA fragmentation and morphological changes of apoptosis (20Hockenbery D.M. Oltvai Z.N. Yin X.M. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 241-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3297) Google Scholar, 26Sandstrom P.M. Pardi D. Tebbey P.W. Dudek R.W. Terrian D.M. Folks T.M. Buttke T.M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 365: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), but it is not completely clear if it occurs prior to or after mitochondrial events. Fig. 4 shows that TPx II was able to potently inhibit lipid peroxidation in response to serum deprivation (Fig. 4 A), ceramide (Fig. 4 B) as well as etoposide (Fig. 4 C) treatment, indicating that TPx II indeed can function as a peroxidase to prevent lipid peroxidation and that lipid peroxidation is an intermediate in cell death. However, lipid peroxidation was also inhibited by Bcl-2 as demonstrated in Fig.4 D as well as reported by Hockenbery et al. (20Hockenbery D.M. Oltvai Z.N. Yin X.M. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 241-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3297) Google Scholar). These results suggest that lipid peroxidation is downstream of the site of action of Bcl-2. Importantly, these results indicated to us that even though TPx II may act as a peroxidase, it inhibited lipid peroxidation at least partly indirectly by inhibiting mitochondrial release of cytochrome c and was still indistinguishable from Bcl-2. Bcl-2 has been demonstrated to allow cellular hydrogen peroxide accumulation during apoptosis and to prevent the effects of exogenous hydrogen peroxide on cell death (14Korsmeyer S.J. Yin X.-M. Oltvai Z.N. Veis-Novack D.J. Linette G.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1271: 63-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), suggesting that Bcl-2 functions downstream of an initial oxidative stimulus. We, therefore, evaluated the effects of TPx II on the intracellular accumulation of hydrogen peroxide and the ability of TPx II to protect from hydrogen peroxide-mediated apoptosis. Fig.5 A shows that TPx II protected from hydrogen peroxide-mediated apoptosis equally as well as Bcl-2 (Fig. 5 B). Interestingly, hydrogen peroxide was very potent at inducing cytochrome c release (Fig. 5 C), thus implying that hydrogen peroxide generation in cells may be upstream of mitochondrial events of apoptosis. TPx II was also able to protect from cytochrome c release in response to hydrogen peroxide (Fig.5 C). Finally, we evaluated the ability of TPx II to block accumulation of hydrogen peroxide in cells. TPx II inhibited accumulation of endogenous hydrogen peroxide in response to hydrogen peroxide treatment (Fig. 5 D) nearly completely. On the other hand, Bcl-2 did not inhibit this accumulation despite the ability of both TPx II and Bcl-2 to inhibit hydrogen peroxide induced cell death. These results suggested that TPx II may function directly as a peroxidase to inhibit intracellular accumulation of key peroxides in apoptosis, whereas Bcl-2 functions further downstream by preventing the ability of these peroxides to induce cell death. In this study we demonstrate several interesting and novel points about regulation and ordering of the apoptotic pathway. First, we demonstrate that the protein thioredoxin peroxidase is a potent inhibitor of apoptosis. Second, we demonstrate that TPx II inhibits cell death by a mechanism distinct from Bcl-2 and probably upstream of the site of action of Bcl-2. We also demonstrate that hydrogen peroxide generation in cells is upstream of cytochrome c release. And finally, the results show that TPx II but not Bcl-2 is able to prevent hydrogen peroxide accumulation in cells. This allows us to order the peroxidase upstream of Bcl-2 and cytochrome c release in the apoptotic pathway as suggested in Scheme I. These studies have several interesting and important implications. First, these data demonstrate that a protein with a hitherto unknown cellular function is involved in protecting cells from apoptosis in response to reactive oxygen species. This protection is at a point distinct from that of Bcl-2. Second, this protein is functionally linked to thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase in electron transfer (3Chae H.Z. Chung S.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27670-27678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has recently been demonstrated that the adult T-cell leukemia-derived factor (which was originally described as a factor that induces production of interleukin-2 receptor α by T-cells infected by the human T-cell lymphotrophic virus 1, and is thought to act like a growth factor) is the human homologue of thioredoxin (28Gasdaska P.Y. Obilong J.E. Cotgreave I.A. Powis G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1218: 292-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Adult T-cell leukemia-derived factor has recently been demonstrated to inhibit tumor necrosis factor α- and anti-Fas antibody-induced apoptosis (29Matsuda M. Masutani H. Nakamura H. Miyajima S. Yamauchi A. Yonehara S. Uchida A. Irimajiri K. Horiuchi A. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 3837-3841PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been implicated in imparting resistance to chemotherapeutic agents of ALL cell lines (30Wang J. Kobayashi M. Sakurado K. Imamura M. Moriuchi T. Hosokawa M. Blood. 1997; 89: 2480-2487Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results, coupled with our data on the protection of apoptosis by thioredoxin peroxidase, place thioredoxin/TPx II in a crucial position in the regulation of apoptosis.

In conclusion, our data that TPx II/NKEF is an effective inhibitor of apoptosis in response to several different insults, coupled with its role as an antioxidant, place it in a critical position for elucidating mechanisms of apoptosis. The results also suggest a possible role for TPx II in diseases involving apoptosis induced by oxidative damage.

But what fraction of the underlying evolutionary history survives when k of n species in a taxon are lost? This is relevant both to how species loss has translated into a loss of evolutionary history and to assigning conservation priorities. Here it is shown that approximately 80 percent of the underlying tree of life can survive even when approximately 95 percent of species are lost, and that algorithms that maximize the amount of evolutionary history preserved are not much better than choosing the survivors at random.

Chem. 1995; 270: 24287-24291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 38Rigaud G. Roux J. Pictet R. Grange T. Cell. 1991; 67: 977-986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). We transiently transfected these cells with two distinct luciferase reporter constructs to elucidate the mechanism of synergy between IL-6 and glucocorticoids. The first construct (Fib-Luc) contains the proximal promoter region of the rat γ-fibrinogen gene (−300 to +54 base pairs), which has three IL-6-responsive elements (IL-6RE) but no glucocorticoid-responsive element (GRE) (33Zhang Z. Fuentes N.L. Fuller G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24287-24291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). As expected, IL-6, but not dexamethasone, enhanced luciferase activity in these transfected cells. However, when IL-6 and dexamethasone were added together, the response was synergistic (Fig.1 A). The IL-6/dexamethasone synergy observed on the Fib-Luc construct is dependent on the integrity of all three IL-6REs, since mutation of any of these sites affects the synergistic response (33Zhang Z. Fuentes N.L. Fuller G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24287-24291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The MMTV-Luc construct contains the mouse mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat, which has four GRE sites (23Stocklin E. Wissler M. Gouilleux F. Groner B. Nature. 1996; 383: 726-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar), but no IL-6RE. Although luciferase activity was not enhanced by IL-6, a synergistic response was again measured when cells were co-stimulated with IL-6 and dexamethasone (Fig. 1 B). These data demonstrate that the IL-6/glucocorticoid synergism can occur via either an IL-6RE- or GRE-containing promoter. It has been proposed that synergy between IL-6 and glucocorticoids in hepatoma cells occurs through glucocorticoid-enhanced expression of IL-6 signaling components, namely the IL-6 receptor and gp130 (28Nesbitt J.E. Fuller G.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 29Pietzko D. Zohlnhofer D. Graeve L. Fleischer D. Heinrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4250-4258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, this does not explain the synergy observed using the MMTV-Luc construct (Fig. 1 B). To determine the importance of the IL-6 signaling components in IL-6/glucocorticoid synergism, we utilized COS-7 cells to perform reconstitution experiments. COS-7 cells do not respond to either IL-6 or glucocorticoids because expression of the IL-6 receptor, gp130, STAT3, and the GR is extremely low in these cells (3Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1744) Google Scholar, 23Stocklin E. Wissler M. Gouilleux F. Groner B.

Science. 1992; 255: 1434-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). The glucocorticoid (23Stocklin E. Wissler M. Gouilleux F. Groner B. Nature. 1996; 383: 726-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar) and IL-6 signaling pathways can be restored in COS-7 cells through the introduction of expression vectors encoding for the appropriate signaling components, the IL-6 receptor, gp130, STAT3, and the GR (Fig. 2). Co-transfection with the Fib-Luc reporter construct in this context confirms restoration of the IL-6 response (Fig. 2 A). The simultaneous introduction of the GR with IL-6 signaling components resulted in an enhanced responsiveness to IL-6 and dexamethasone. Experiments using the MMTV-Luc construct (Fig. 2 B) showed that dexamethasone signaling could be re-established in COS-7 cells through expression of the GR. Transfection with the IL-6 receptor, gp130, and STAT3 had no effect on MMTV-Luc luciferase activity; however, upon co-transfection with the GR, a synergistic response was observed after stimulation with IL-6 and dexamethasone. It should be pointed out that transfected cells possessing all the components but devoid of STAT3 showed no synergism. This result clearly defines the central role of STAT3 in synergistically enhancing glucocorticoid signaling. The binding of STAT3 to a conserved TTCTGGGAA motif is the classic mechanism for STAT3 action (2Akira S. Nishio Y. Inoue M. Wang X. Wei S. Matsusaka T. Yoshida K. Sudo T. Naruto M. Kishimoto T. Cell. 1994; 77: 63-71Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar, 6Zhong Z. Wen Z. Darnell J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, our observations suggest that STAT3 can modulate GR signaling independent of IL-6RE binding. Ligand-bound GR can directly activate target gene transcription through the GRE (17McEwan I.J. Wright A.P. Gustafsson J.A. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this receptor-ligand complex can modulate gene expression independently of DNA binding by associating with other transcription factors or nuclear co-factors (17McEwan I.J. Wright A.P. Gustafsson J.A. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 19Schule R. Rangarajan P. Kliewer S. Ransone L.J. Bolado J. Yang N. Verma I.M. Evans R.M.

We postulated that STAT3 might interact directly with the GR, thereby enhancing the transactivation of each component through its responsive element. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed using nuclear extracts obtained from H4IIE cells (Fig.3). Proteins were immunoprecipitated with an anti-GR antibody and visualized by Western blotting using a STAT3 specific antibody (Fig. 3 A). A STAT3-GR complex was detected only in extracts obtained from cells co-stimulated with IL-6 and dexamethasone. The STAT3-GR complex was also detected when the anti-STAT3 antibody was used for immunoprecipitation and the anti-GR antibody for Western blot analysis (Fig. 3 B). A possible functional role for this complex was demonstrated by EMSA using an oligonucleotide containing a high affinity STAT3 binding site (37Hocke G.M. Barry D. Fey G.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2282-2294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IL-6 stimulation of H4IIE cells induced activation of STAT3 (Fig.3 C, lanes 1–4). The inclusion of either an anti-GR antibody (lane 6) or anti-STAT3 (lane 7) in the EMSA reaction affected the protein-DNA complex. In particular, anti-GR antibodies blocked complex formation (lane 6), whereas antibodies to STAT3 supershifted the complex (lane 7). The inclusion of an equivalent amount of control antibody had no effect (lanes 5). These data indicate the presence of both the GR and STAT3 in a protein-DNA complex. Activated STAT3 is, therefore, able to bind the IL-6RE while associated with ligand-bound GR. Experimental attempts to show the STAT3-GR complex bound to a GRE probe were unsuccessful because of the weak binding of the glucocorticoid-induced complex to the GRE probe (data not shown). It is known that GR interacts with certain transcription factors (17McEwan I.J. Wright A.P. Gustafsson J.A. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The interaction between the GR and AP-1 prevents their binding to either the AP-1 site or the GRE site and antagonizes the transactivational capacities of both regulators (19Schule R. Rangarajan P. Kliewer S. Ransone L.J. Bolado J. Yang N. Verma I.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1990; 62: 1217-1226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar, 20Yang-Yen H. Chambard J. Sun Y. Smeal T. Schmidt T.J. Droulin J. Karin M. Cell. 1990; 62: 1205-1215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1319) Google Scholar). The interaction between the GR and STAT5 enhances STAT5-mediated transactivation but diminishes GR function at the GRE site (23Stocklin E. Wissler M. Gouilleux F. Groner B. Nature. 1996; 383: 726-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Our results suggest a third type of interaction, which leads to the synergistic transactivation at both the IL-6RE and the GRE. We have demonstrated the formation of a STAT3-GR complex which can bind to the IL-6RE. In this case, GR can act as a co-activator. However, we can not fully reconstitute the synergism using the Fib-Luc construct in COS-7 cells (Fig. 2 A), suggesting that the STAT3/GR complex is insufficient for the strong synergy observed through the IL-6RE (Fig.1 A); additional factors may be required. On the other hand, we have shown that STAT3 is central to the synergy activated through the GRE (Figs. 1 B and 2 B). In this case, STAT3 is a potent co-activator of GRE-mediated transcription, independent of IL-6RE binding. These findings reveal a novel level of interaction between the IL-6 and glucocorticoid signaling pathways and suggest that STAT3 may modulate other glucocorticoid actions. Furthermore, since STAT3 and the GR have important roles in multiple cellular processes, such as cell growth and differentiation, cell cycle control, apoptosis, and development (32Helmberg A.

These results indicate that Tip60 is a histone acetyltransferase with a novel property, suggesting that Tip60 and its related factors may introduce a distinct alteration on chromatin. Genetic material of eukaryotes is packaged into chromatin, of which the most fundamental structural unit is the nucleosome comprised of DNA and histones (1Kornberg R. Science. 1974; 184: 868-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (1680) Google Scholar). Core histones are not only the primary proteins that fold DNA into chromatin but also play a key role in transcriptional regulation (reviewed in Ref. 2Wolffe A.P.

Recent molecular cloning of histone acetyltransferase (HAT) 1The abbreviations used are; HAT, histone acetyltransferase; CBB, Coomassie Brilliant Blue; CoA, coenzyme A; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; LTR, long terminal repeat; HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus, type 1.

Currently identified nuclear HATs are transcription factors such as GCN5-related factors, p300/CBP, and TAFII250. These findings further confirm the correlation between core histone acetylation and transcriptional activity of chromatin. In the case of transcriptional regulation of HIV-1, recent observations have shown that global hyperacetylation of histones induced by histone deacetylase inhibitors promotes nucleosome disruption at the transcriptional start site of the 5′ LTR to lead transcriptional activation of HIV-1 5′ LTR, suggesting a role of histone acetylation in transcriptional regulation of HIV-1 (12Van Lint C. Emiliani S. Ott M. Verdin E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1112-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Tip60 was isolated as an HIV-1-Tat interactive protein and has been shown to modestly augment Tat-dependent transcriptional activation (13Kamine J. Elangovan B. Subramanian T. Coleman D. Chinnadurai G. Virology. 1996; 216: 357-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). It contains an evolutionarily conserved domain (about 250 amino acids in length; 40–50% identity) shared by several factors isolated by different genetic procedures (14Borrow J. Stanton Jr., V.P. Andresen J.M. Becher R. Behm F.G. Chaganti R.S.K. Civin C.I. Disteche C. Dubé I. Frischauf A.M. Horsman D. Mitelman F. Volinia S. Watmore A.E. Housman D.E. Nat.

MOZ, a human member of this family, was found as a gene fused to CBP by a recurrent translocation associated with acute myeloid leukemia (14Borrow J. Stanton Jr., V.P. Andresen J.M. Becher R. Behm F.G. Chaganti R.S.K. Civin C.I. Disteche C. Dubé I. Frischauf A.M. Horsman D. Mitelman F. Volinia S. Watmore A.E. Housman D.E. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar).mof, a related gene in Drosophila, was genetically isolated as a factor required for X-linked dosage compensation, the male-specific hypertranscription of X-linked genes (15Hilfiker A. Hilfiker-Kleiner D. Pannuti A. Lucchesi J.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2054-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). SAS2, a related gene in yeast, was isolated as a positive effector of transcriptional silencing and seems to be incorporated in a process of transcriptional repression together with its related factor SAS3 (16Reifsnyder C. Lowell J. Clarke A. Pillus L. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The domain contains a short structural motif that is found in acetyltransferases and is speculated to be an acetyl-CoA binding site (14Borrow J. Stanton Jr., V.P. Andresen J.M. Becher R. Behm F.G. Chaganti R.S.K. Civin C.I. Disteche C. Dubé I. Frischauf A.M. Horsman D. Mitelman F. Volinia S. Watmore A.E. Housman D.E. Nat.

It is an attractive hypothesis that Tip60 is an acetyltransferase whose substrates are histones; however, the primary structure of that domain, besides the short structural motif consisting of 20 amino acids in length, is totally unrelated to known acetyltransferases, and no biochemical evidence has been reported on the acetyltransferase activity to date (14Borrow J. Stanton Jr., V.P. Andresen J.M. Becher R. Behm F.G. Chaganti R.S.K. Civin C.I. Disteche C. Dubé I. Frischauf A.M. Horsman D. Mitelman F. Volinia S. Watmore A.E. Housman D.E. Nat.

These results lead us to ask the following questions. First, whether the conserved domain among Tip60 and its related genes has acetyltransferase activity that modifies histones. Second, if it should have HAT activity, which histone species are acetylated, because the primary structure of the conserved domain other than the 20-amino acid structural motif is totally unrelated to known HATs. To address these questions, we investigated the histone acetyltransferase activity of the evolutionarily conserved domain of Tip60. Isolation of cDNA fragments encoding Tip60 as a potential interacting factor with a native human transcription factor will be published elsewhere. General methods for DNA manipulation were as described (17Sambrook J. Fritsh E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar).NdeI recognition sequence was introduced at the first in-frame methionine codon (nucleotide position 605) of the Tip60 cDNA with the mutagenic oligonucleotide TCTGATGGAATACCGTCAGGATCCCATATGACTGGCAGCCTG as described (18Yamamoto T. Poon D. Weil P.A. Horikoshi M. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Note that the proposed translation start site of Tip60 is not methionine but leucine headed by no in-frame stop codon (13Kamine J. Elangovan B. Subramanian T. Coleman D. Chinnadurai G. Virology. 1996; 216: 357-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). 2Note that the proposed translation start site of Tip60 is not methionine but leucine headed by no in-frame stop codon (12Van Lint C. Emiliani S. Ott M. Verdin E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1112-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that the 171st residue from the first in-frame methionine to date (351st residue from the putative translation initiation site) in the acetyl-CoA binding motif could be G (GGC). It is R (CGG) in the original report (12Van Lint C. Emiliani S. Ott M. Verdin E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1112-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar); however, the nucleotide sequencing of our Tip60 cDNA clearly indicated that the residue should be G (data not shown) as the corresponding residue of other related factors (13Kamine J. Elangovan B. Subramanian T. Coleman D. Chinnadurai G. Virology. 1996; 216: 357-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 14Borrow J. Stanton Jr., V.P. Andresen J.M. Becher R. Behm F.G.

It seems unlikely that we have isolated a closely related factor to Tip60, because other nucleotide sequences of our Tip60 cDNA analyzed so far are identical to that shown in the original report (data not shown). The NdeI (created)-BamHI fragment of the resultant plasmid was introduced into 6HisT-pET11d (19Hoffmann A. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6337-6338Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The resultant plasmid was transfected into Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3);LysS (20Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorf J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6011) Google Scholar), and the transformed E. coli were grown at 27 °C. Expression of the transfected gene was induced by adding isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to 0.4 mm when theA 595 of the culture reached 0.8. 3 h after induction, the bacteria were collected and washed with buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9 at 4 °C) and 0.2m NaCl. The washed bacteria cells were suspended in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9 at 4 °C), 0.5m NaCl, 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5m NaCl, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. Cells were disrupted by sonicating the suspension until theA 595 was reduced to 20% of the original value. The sonicated lysate was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was diluted with equal volume of buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9 at 4 °C), 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10% (v/v) glycerol) and loaded on a heparin-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) column. The column was washed with 2-column volume of buffer A containing 0.2 mKCl and developed with a linear gradient of 0.2–1.0 m KCl in buffer A. Recombinant Tip60 was eluted around 0.6 m KCl. Nickel-agarose resin (Invitrogen) equilibrated with buffer A containing 0.6 m KCl was added to the pooled fraction, and the mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 30 min with continuous gentle mixing. The resin was successively washed with the following buffers; buffer A containing 0.5 m KCl, buffer A containing 0.5 mKCl and 20 mm imidazole, and buffer A containing 0.25m KCl and 20 mm imidazole. The bound protein was eluted with buffer A containing 0.25 m KCl and 0.2m imidazole. Filter binding assays for HAT activity were performed essentially as described (6Ogryzko V.V. Shiltz R.L.

Enzyme samples were incubated for 10 min at 30 °C in 25 μl of buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0 at 25 °C), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm sodium butylate, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 6 pmol [3H]acetyl-CoA (NEN Life Science Products; 37 GBq/mmol) and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (Seikagaku Co.) with or without 40 μg/ml calf thymus histone (Sigma). For the assay of Tip60C, 0.5 pmol of purified recombinant protein was used. The reaction was spotted onto P81 phosphocellulose filter paper (Whatman) and washed with 0.2 m sodium carbonate (pH 9.2) for 10 min at room temperature. The filter paper was successively washed with the same buffer for 10, 5, and 5 min at room temperature, respectively. The washed filter paper was dried for 30 min at room temperature and counted in a liquid scintillation counter. PAGE analysis was performed as described above except that 90 pmol of [14C]acetyl-CoA (NEN Life Science Products; 2.2 GBq/mmol) were used as substrates. Their purity was verified by CBB staining the image of SDS-PAGE (see Fig. 4). Core histones and nucleosomes of HeLa cell nuclei were prepared as described (6Ogryzko V.V. Shiltz R.L. Russanova V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1996; 87: 953-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2421) Google Scholar). BamHI fragment of Tip60 cDNA were introduced to pEGFP-C2 (CLONTECH). The resultant plasmid that expresses GFP-Tip60 fusion protein was transfected into COS cells with Tfx™-50 Reagent (Promega) following the manufacturer's instructions. 24 h after transfection, GFP fluorescence images of transfected living cells on a culture dish were directly photographed using Zeiss filter set 09 (excitation, 450–490 nm; barrier,510 nm; emission, 520 nm). To test the biochemical nature of Tip60, a recombinant Tip60 C-terminal fragment was prepared. The C-terminal fragment of Tip60, depicted in Fig.1 A, was introduced into 6HisT-pET11d, which expresses proteins in E. coli with six histidine residues appended to the N termini (19Hoffmann A. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6337-6338Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). This fragment composed of the highly conserved region shared with MOZ,mof, SAS2, and SAS3 was designated Tip60C (Fig. 1 A). Although most of the expressed protein become insoluble in E. coli, a fraction of Tip60C remained soluble and efficiently bound heparin-Sepharose resin. Recombinant Tip60C was further purified by nickel-agarose chromatography, around 90% purity estimated from CBB staining (Fig. 1 B). This fraction was used in the following biochemical experiments. First we tested the histone acetyltransferase activity of Tip60C. Purified recombinant Tip60C was incubated with calf thymus histones and [3H]acetyl-CoA. Acetylation of histones was detected as retained 3H radioactivity on P81 filter paper (6Ogryzko V.V. Shiltz R.L. Russanova V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1996; 87: 953-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2421) Google Scholar). Histone-dependent radioactivity retained on the filter paper was observed in the presence of Tip60C as well as in the presence of the recombinant p300 fragment (6Ogryzko V.V. Shiltz R.L. Russanova V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1996; 87: 953-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2421) Google Scholar), which has been previously reported to have HAT activity (Fig. 2). The nickel-agarose bound fraction of the extract prepared from E. coli harboring only 6HisT-pET11d vector plasmid showed negligible activity in comparison to the background. These results indicate that Tip60C readily acetylates histones and provide the first biochemical evidence of HAT activity of Tip60 and its related factors. HAT has a species localized in cytoplasm as HAT1 in yeast (4Parthun M.R. Widom J. Gottschling D.E. Cell. 1996; 87: 85-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), and the putative acetyl-CoA binding motif found in Tip60 resembles more closely that of HAT1 than that of Gcn5-related nuclear HATs (Fig. 1 A). Lack of direct evidence of subcellular localization of Tip60 and its related factors leads us to determine where Tip60 can be distributed in a cell. GFP was appended to the N terminus of the C-terminal region of Tip60 started from the 132nd residue from the putative translation start site, and the resultant fusion protein was transiently expressed in COS cells. GFP fluorescence of the fusion protein was primarily detected in the nucleus with some speckled images, whereas GFP itself was plainly distributed in the cells (Fig. 3), indicating that Tip60 has the potential to be readily transported into the nucleus. These findings strongly suggest that Tip60 and its related factors form a new family of nuclear HAT whose primary structure is unrelated to other HATs reported so far. Subcellular localization of GFP-Tip60 fusion protein in nucleus with speckles suggests that Tip60 may have the potential to be incorporated in a distinct complex in the nucleus. Difference of the primary structure of the conserved domain of Tip60 to other known HATs leads us to speculate that its substrate specificity for histones might be different from others. To determine the substrate specificity of the histone acetyltransferase activity of Tip60C, a core histone mixture prepared from HeLa cell nuclei were incubated with Tip60C and [14C]acetyl-CoA. The resultant acetylated histones were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Autoradiogram of the separated histones clearly indicated that Tip60C acetylated core histones H2A, H3, and H4 but that no acetylation was observed for H2B (Fig. 4). When all four species of core histone mixture were used as substrates, CBP/p300 acetylates all histones and others (yGcn5p, hGCN5, P/CAF, and TAFII250) acetylate predominantly H3 and H4 (5Yang X.-J.

Widom J. Gottschling D.E. Cell. 1996; 87: 85-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). No histone acetyltransferase analyzed to date acetylates histones with this specificity, indicating that Tip60 is a nuclear HAT with novel substrate specificity. The biological significance of this substrate specificity is currently under investigation; however, this specificity may reflect the functional characteristics of Tip60-related factors. One possibility is that Tip60 and probably its related factors may distinctly mark a specific position in chromatin by this unique acetylation of histones, which could be a clue for subsequent molecular association. It should be pointed that nuclear histone acetyltransferases analyzed to date, such as GCN5, P/CAF, CBP, and TAFII250, are primarily considered to play a role in transcriptional activation, whereas Tip60-related factors may differently contribute to regulation of transcription. Tip60 is suggested to augment Tat-dependent transcriptional activation (13Kamine J. Elangovan B. Subramanian T. Coleman D. Chinnadurai G. Virology. 1996; 216: 357-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), and mof was genetically isolated as a factor required for X-linked dosage compensation (15Hilfiker A. Hilfiker-Kleiner D. Pannuti A. Lucchesi J.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2054-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). These factors appear to be involved in transcriptional activation. On the contrary,SAS2 and SAS3 were isolated as positive regulators of transcriptional silencing (16Reifsnyder C. Lowell J. Clarke A. Pillus L. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), and they seem to be involved in the repression of transcription. It would be plausible that specific molecular assembly directing unique acetylation of histones modified by Tip60 and its related factors subsequently causes a distinct effect on transcription together with their interacting factors. HIV-1 Tat might affect these processes through interaction with Tip60 to augment the transcriptional activation of HIV 5′ LTR. Tip60C readily acetylates histones; however, the activity was greatly reduced when nucleosomes were used as substrates (data not shown), suggesting that Tip60 might function as a member of a multi-protein complex in vivo, as in the case of GCN5 (23Ruiz-Garcia A.B. Sendra R. Pamblanco M. Tordera V. FEBS Lett. 1997; 403: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 24Grant P.A. Duggan L. Cote J. Roberts S.M. Brownell J.E. Candau R. Ohba R. Owen-Hughes T. Allis C.D. Winston F. Berger S.L. Workman J.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1640-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). Alternatively, because Tip60C is a fragment of Tip60 composed of an evolutionarily conserved region in this family, it might be possible that the N-terminal region of Tip60 might be necessary to acetylate nuclesomal histones. The amino acid sequences flanking the conserved region are different among the members of this family (14Borrow J. Stanton Jr., V.P. Andresen J.M. Becher R. Behm F.G. Chaganti R.S.K. Civin C.I. Disteche C. Dubé I. Frischauf A.M. Horsman D. Mitelman F. Volinia S. Watmore A.E. Housman D.E. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 15Hilfiker A.

Genet. 1996; 14: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), leading to the attractive hypothesis that their potential HAT activity might be regulated by their flanking region and/or associating factor(s) to these regions, which might produce functional differences observed in Tip60 and its related factors.

To determine whether hydrogen can account for a major part of the density deficit and is therefore an important constituent in the molten iron outer core, the hydrogen concentration in molten iron was measured at 7.5 gigapascals. From these measurements, the metal-silicate melt partitioning coefficient of hydrogen was determined as a function of temperature. If the magma ocean of primordial Earth was hydrous, more than 95 mole percent of H 2 O in this ocean should have reacted with iron to form FeH x , and about 60 percent of the density deficit is reconciled by adding hydrogen to the core."

Here, mutations in the DFos gene are described. In dorsal closure, DFos cooperates with DJun by regulating the expression of dpp; Dpp acts as a relay signal that triggers cell shape changes and DFos expression in neighboring cells. In addition to the joint requirement of DFos and DJun during dorsal closure, DFos functions independently of DJun during early stages of embryogenesis. These findings demonstrate common and distinct roles of DFos and DJun during embryogenesis and suggest a conserved link between AP-1 (activating protein-1) and TGF-beta (transforming growth factor-beta) signaling during epithelial cell shape changes."

Results are consistent with a non-spin-degenerate single particle picture of the filling of levels. Electron-electron interaction effects are also observed as a perturbation to this model.

Our results suggest that phosphorylation of the head domain by Ste20p-like protein kinases plays an essential role in the function of myosin-I in yeast cells. Myosin-I proteins are unconventional single-headed, nonfilamenting myosins consisting of a heavy chain and one or more light chains (for a review, see Refs. 1Brzeska H. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16983-16986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar and 2Hasson T. Mooseker M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16431-16434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal portion of the heavy chain forms a head domain, which displays actin-stimulated Mg2+-ATPase activity and generates the mechanochemical force for actin-based motile processes. The carboxyl-terminal portion forms a globular tail domain with binding sites for phospholipids and, in some isoforms, an ATP-independent filamentous actin binding site and a Src homology 3 domain. While first described inAcanthamoeba, myosin-I has now been identified in many eukaryotic cells, including yeast, and is known to exist in many multiple isoforms (1Brzeska H. Korn E.D. J. Biol.

However, the physiological roles of these isoforms and their in vivo regulation are not well understood. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, two functionally redundant isoforms encoded by the MYO3 andMYO5 genes have been shown to be required for the organization of the actin cytoskeleton during budding (3Goodson H.V.

Science. 1996; 272: 533-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Depending on the yeast strain, disruption of both genes causes either extremely poor growth (3Goodson H.V. Anderson B.L.

The biochemical characterization of myosin-I isoforms fromAcanthamoeba and Dictyostelium has demonstrated that phosphorylation of a single site in the heavy chain head domain is necessary to attain maximal actin-stimulated Mg2+-ATPase activity and to contract and move actin filaments in in vitro assay systems (5Zot H.G.

Serine residue 357 of Myo3p was changed to an alanine residue using a two-step polymerase chain reaction procedure. First, two polymerase chain reactions were performed using the oligodeoxynucleotide primer pairs OCW67 and OCW69AR (5′-GGGTTCAAAGGTACATGATAACGGCGCCTCTCTTCATTCC-3′) and OCW69A (5′-GGAATGAAGAGAGGCGCCGTTTATCATGTACCTTTGAACCC-3′) 3The introduced nucleotide changes are underlined. and OCW68, respectively, and plasmid pVL96 as a template. The amplified fragments were then purified, mixed, and used as templates for an additional polymerase chain reaction using the oligodeoxynucleotides OCW67 and OCW68 as primers. The resulting fragment was then digested with SalI and SmaI and cloned into pRS315 to yield plasmid pVL97. The same procedure was used to create plasmid pVL98 carrying an alteration of serine residue 357 to an aspartate residue. The mutagenizing oligodeoxynucleotides in the first two polymerase chain reactions were OCW63DR (5′-GGGTCCAAAGGTACATGATAGACGTCGCCTCTCTTCATTCC-3′) and OCW63D (5′-GGAATGAAGAGAGGCGACGTCTATCATGTACCTTTGAACCC-3′),3respectively. To convert the alanine or aspartate residues at position 357 back to serine residues, plasmids pVL97 and pVL98, respectively, were mutagenized by the two-step polymerase chain reaction described above using the oligodeoxynucleotide primer pairs OCW67 and OCW72AR (5′-GGGTTCAAAGGTACATGATAAACTGAGCCTCTCTTCATTCC-3′) and OCW72A (5′-GGAATGAAGAGAGGCTCAGTTTATCATGTACCTTTGAACCC-3′) and OCW68, respectively. The fragments were subcloned into pRS315 to yield plasmids pVL104 and pVL105, respectively. All the predicted nucleotide changes were confirmed by DNA sequencing.

Prior to the phosphorylation reaction, Ste20p and Cla4p immune complexes were incubated in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin) with 0.2 mm ATP for 20 min at 30 °C to stimulate autophosphorylation of the protein kinases. The immune complexes were then washed three times in buffer A and added to the phosphorylation mixture consisting of 2 μg of GST-Myo3p fusion protein and 5 μm[γ-32P]ATP (1 × 104 Ci/mol) in 50 μl of buffer A. After incubation for 20 min at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped by addition of 50 μl of 2 × Laemmli buffer (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207516) Google Scholar).

Our recent finding that the heavy chain from myosin-ID fromDictyostelium is a target for the Ste20p and Cla4p protein kinases from yeast (9Wu C. Lee S.-F. Furmaniak-Kazmierczak E. Côté G.P. Thomas D.Y. Leberer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31787-31790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) prompted us to investigate whether these protein kinases are capable of phosphorylating the yeast myosin-I isoform Myo3pin vitro and whether the phosphorylation site recognized by these kinases is of physiological significance for the function of Myo3p in vivo. We found that a fragment of Myo3p from residues 19 to 619 fused to GST and purified from E. coli is an in vitro substrate for both Ste20p and Cla4p, which were immunopurified from yeast (Fig. 1). The catalytically inactive mutant versions of these kinases, in which the highly conserved lysine residues in the catalytic sites were replaced with arginine residues, were unable to phosphorylate the GST-Myo3p fusion protein (Fig. 1). The phosphorylated residues responsible for the in vitroactivation of Acanthamoeba myosin-I isoforms have been identified as either serine or threonine residues within the sequence motif (K/R)X(S/T)XY that is conserved in the heavy chains of all myosin-I isoforms from Acanthamoeba, Dictyostelium, and Aspergillus, and in theDrosophila and mammalian class VI myosins (30Brzeska H. Lynch T.J. Martin B. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19340-19348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Bement W.M. Mooseker M.S. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1995; 31: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). This regulatory residue is conserved at position 357 in the sequence motif KRGSVY of yeast Myo3p (32Goodson H.V. Spudich J.A. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1995; 30: 73-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In the Myo5p isoform, the same sequence motif is conserved at the identical position (3Goodson H.V. Anderson B.L. Warrick H.M. Pon L.A. Spudich J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1277-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 4Geli M.I. Riezman H. Science. 1996; 272: 533-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). We have changed serine residue 357 in Myo3p to either alanine or aspartate and analyzed the mutant fragments fused to GST as substrates for Ste20p and Cla4p. Consistent with the view that serine residue 357 of Myo3p represents the site phosphorylated by either Ste20p or Cla4p, we found that the mutant fusion proteins purified from E. coli were not phosphorylated by either of these protein kinases (Fig.2). These results indicate that serine residue 357 represents a unique phosphorylation site in the head domain of Myo3p for the Ste20p and Cla4p protein kinases. To investigate whether serine residue 357 plays a significant role for the function of Myo3p in yeast cells, we used a plasmid-shuffling procedure to replace the MYO3 wild type gene with the mutant versions encoding the mutant proteins in which serine residue 357 was replaced with alanine and aspartate residues, respectively. Plasmids carrying wild type MYO3 and the mutant versions were transformed into a myo3Δ myo5Δ strain whose viability was supported by a plasmid carrying MYO5 and URA3as a selectable marker. Loss of the MYO5 plasmid was then promoted by the presence of 5-fluoroorotic acid (33Boeke J.D. Trueheart J. Natsoulis G. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 164-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig. 3, the Myo3pS357A mutant protein was unable to fulfill the essential function of Myo3p. However, the Myo3pS357D mutant was able to do so (Fig. 3). The wild type function of Myo3p was regained when the alanine residue in the mutant protein was reverted to a serine residue confirming that the mutant phenotype was caused by the serine to alanine mutation at position 357 and not by a secondary mutation (data not shown). These results suggest that phosphorylation of serine 357 may be essential for the function of Myo3p and that replacement of the serine residue with an aspartate residue may constitutively activate the myosin protein through introduction of a negative charge at this position. It seems reasonable to suppose that under wild type conditions this activation is brought about by phosphorylation through the Ste20p and Cla4p protein kinases, respectively. Cells deleted for the CLA4 gene alone are viable but have defects in cytokinesis (16Cvrckova F. De Virgilio C. Manser E. Pringle J.R. Nasmyth K. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1817-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Cells deleted for STE20 alone are also viable but have defects in mating (17Leberer E. Dignard D. Harcus D. Thomas D.Y. Whiteway M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4815-4824Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Deletion of both genes causes lethality (16Cvrckova F. De Virgilio C. Manser E. Pringle J.R. Nasmyth K. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1817-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Thus, Ste20p and Cla4p have unique functions in cytokinesis and mating and also share an essential function during budding. If Myo3p were the only essential target for Ste20p and Cla4p required for budding, the constitutively active Myo3pS357Dmutant would be expected to bypass the requirement of Ste20p and Cla4p for cellular viability. Therefore, in a plasmid-shuffling experiment we asked whether the Myo3pS357D mutant protein might compensate the growth defect of cells lacking both Ste20p and Cla4p. Plasmids carrying wild type MYO3 and the S357A and S357D mutant versions were transformed into a cla4Δ ste20Δstrain whose viability was supported by a plasmid carryingCLA4 and URA3 as a selectable marker. Loss of theCLA4 plasmid was then promoted with 5-fluoroorotic acid (33Boeke J.D. Trueheart J. Natsoulis G. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 164-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). We found that none of the MYO3 versions, including the S357D mutant, could support viability of the cells (Fig.4). A microscopic analysis of these cells showed a pleiotropic population of large and irregularly shaped cells and revealed many ghost cells indicative of cell lysis (data not shown). This phenotype is typical for cells which lack Ste20p and Cla4p (18Leberer E. Wu C. Leeuw T. Fourest-Lieuvin A. Segall J.E. Thomas D.Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 83-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and suggests that the constitutively active Myo3p mutant version is unable to bypass the essential functions of Ste20p and Cla4p. The most likely interpretation of this result is that myosin-I is not the only essential target of these protein kinases. This view is also supported by the observation that the lysis phenotype of cells lacking Ste20p and Cla4p could not be observed in cells lacking Myo3p and Myo5p. Thus, in addition to myosin-I, Ste20p and Cla4p may have several other targets that are required for viability of yeast cells. We also found that the cytokinesis defect caused by deletion ofCLA4 alone was not complemented by the Myo3pS357D mutant suggesting that myosin-I is not the primary target for Cla4p during cytokinesis. Moreover, defects in pheromone-induced morphogenesis during mating in cells deleted forSTE20 alone could not be cured by expression of the mutant protein. Thus, myosin-I is unlikely to be a target of Ste20p in morphogenesis during mating. This view is also supported by the observation that cells depleted for Myo3p and Myo5p have no discernible mating defects (3Goodson H.V. Anderson B.L. Warrick H.M. Pon L.A. Spudich J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1277-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Cells deleted for MYO3 and MYO5 whose viability was supported by expression of the MYO3 S357Dmutant version did not reveal any discernible mutant phenotype (data not shown). These cells showed normal growth rates and had a normal cellular morphology. The actin cytoskeleton, as revealed by phalloidin staining (18Leberer E. Wu C. Leeuw T. Fourest-Lieuvin A. Segall J.E. Thomas D.Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 83-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), appeared normal. Growth arrest, the formation of mating-specific morphologies, and the induction of a pheromone-responsive reporter gene, FUS1::lacZ, in response to pheromone stimulation (18Leberer E. Wu C. Leeuw T. Fourest-Lieuvin A. Segall J.E. Thomas D.Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 83-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) were also normal. Moreover, mating efficiencies were indistinguishable from those of wild type cells. Thus, although phosphorylation of serine residue 357 appears to be essential for the function of Myo3p, this type of regulation may not be the only mechanism that controls the in vivo function of myosin-I. Other targets of modification may include protein-protein interactions mediated by the Src homology 3 domain of the heavy chain of myosin-I and the myosin-I light chains (1Brzeska H. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16983-16986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 2Hasson T. Mooseker M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16431-16434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the heavy chain by Ste20p-like kinases may be only one essential step in the control of myosin-I function through multiple mechanisms. Together, our results demonstrate that a conserved serine residue in the head domain of the myosin-I isoform Myo3p from yeast can serve as a phosphorylation site for members of the Ste20p protein kinase family. This residue is essential for the in vivo function of myosin-I, suggesting that its phosphorylation by Ste20p or Cla4p plays an essential role in the regulation of this myosin-I isoform. This study shows for the first time in a genetically tractable model organism that the conserved phosphorylation site of myosin-I is relevant for its in vivo regulation. In view of the high degree of evolutionary sequence conservation of both the myosin-I and the Ste20p isoforms and the finding that the PAKs from mammalian cells are capable of phosphorylating myosin-I heavy chains fromDictyostelium (9Wu C.

https://openalex.org/W2001217450,"Development of colon cancer is a multistep process frequently involving mutations in both theAPC and p53 tumor suppressor genes. In this study we treated the HCT-116 colon cancer cell line with alkylating agents includingN-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG),which is known to cause colon cancer in animals, and examined the expression of both APC and p53genes. Exposure of cells with MNNG caused an 8–12-fold increase in the level of APC mRNA and protein. APC induction was shown to result from increased nuclear transcription of the APCgene and correlated with a concomitant increase in the p53 protein level after MNNG treatment. A necessary role for p53 in APCgene regulation is supported by the failure of MNNG to induceAPC expression in cell lines either expressing very low levels of p53 (HeLa cells) or no p53 (K562 erythroleukemia cells). The overexpression of wild-type p53 gene into HCT-116 cells mimicked the effect of MNNG-induced expression of APCmRNA. A direct causal role for p53 in APC gene regulation was further evaluated by transfecting the wild-typep53 gene into K562 cells and observing a 5-fold increase in the APC gene expression. These results support a model featuring a direct link between p53 and APC in response to alkylation-induced DNA damage and suggest a novel role for p53 in a stress-response pathway involving APC.

The phenotype of a cell expressing a mutated APC gene can be reverted by increased expression of the remaining wild-typeAPC allele and provide evidence that overexpression of the wild-type APC gene alone can suppress tumorigenicity (18Groden J.

Gut. 1995; 37: 826-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Thus, understanding the mechanisms by which APC gene expression can be induced at the molecular level is critical. The tumor suppressor gene p53 is also frequently mutated in colon cancer cells (3Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1996; 87: 159-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4286) Google Scholar). The wild-type p53 protein is necessary for monitoring the G1 checkpoint, sensing DNA damage, assembling the DNA repair machinery, modulating gene amplification, or activating apoptosis to remove damaged cells (20Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6759) Google Scholar). p53 activates transcription from specific DNA-binding sites and represses transcription in a binding site-independent manner. Treatment of cells with DNA-damaging agents induces nuclear accumulation of p53, which trans-activates cell cycle- and apoptosis-related genes (20Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6759) Google Scholar). In previous studies, the transient expression of the wild-typeAPC gene into mammalian cells has been shown to cause cell cycle arrest (21Baeg G.H. Matsumine A. Kuroda T. Bhattacharjee R.N. Miyashiro I. Toyoshima K. Akiyama T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5618-5625Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and apoptosis (22Morin P.J. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7950-7954Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). However, whether APC expression in cells treated with DNA-damaging agents is increased and whether p53 plays any role in the expression of the APC are currently unknown. In the present investigation, we demonstrate that APC expression is, in fact, strongly induced after treatment of cells with DNA-damaging agents, such as the potent colon carcinogenN-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) (for review, see Ref. 23Zusman I. Biol. Rev. 1995; 70: 107-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Furthermore, results indicated that the increased expression of the APC after MNNG treatment is dependent upon p53 expression. Mammalian cells respond through a variety of signal transduction pathways after exposure to DNA-damaging agents, leading to specific programs of gene expression and alterations in the activity of proteins (24Narayan S. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 25Narayan S. He F. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18508-18513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) (for review, see Ref. 26Sassone-Corsi P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4717-4728Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Among these effects, increased expression of tumor suppressor genes such as APC may be critical in controlling cellular transformation by delaying cell cycle progression or by inducing apoptosis. Our hypothesis is that exposure to DNA-damaging agents cause DNA damage, which eventually reach a threshold level at which DNA repair mechanisms fail, leading to the induction of apoptosis. We propose that APC, in collaboration with p53, is a critical component of cellular defense mechanisms involving DNA damage-induced cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis. Human cancer cell lines HCT-116 (colon), HeLa S3 (cervical), and K562 (erythroleukemia) were grown in McCoy's 5a medium, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (with high glucose), and RPMI medium, respectively, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 100 μg/ml penicillin and streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). After cells reached to 70% confluence, fresh medium containing 0.5% FBS was added to each dish. Cells were further incubated for an additional 18 h and treated with DNA-alkylating agents for different periods. Total RNA was isolated by TRIzolTM reagent as described by the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.). Fifty micrograms of total RNA were separated on 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred onto a Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham Corp.). The membrane was prehybridized for 6 h at 65 °C in 0.5 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), 7% (w/v) SDS, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and then hybridized with32P-labeled APC probe (EcoRI fragment of APC-HFBCI43 obtained from ATCC). Later the same membrane was reprobed with the 32P-labeled EcoRI fragment of the 18 S RNA probe for normalization of the total RNA loading and transfer efficiency. The membranes were exposed to x-ray films for detection of mRNA signals. After treatment, cells were scraped off, pelleted, and washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cells were lysed in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 2 mmMgCl2, 2 mm DTT, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.1% (w/v) deoxycholate, 1 mm sodium metavanadate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A. The cytosolic fraction was collected by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 5 min. Five-hundred micrograms of the cytosolic protein were immunoprecipitated with APC (N-15) polyclonal IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), separated on a 2% (w/v) low-melting agarose gel, and transferred onto an Immobilon-P transfer membrane (Millipore (27Smith K.J. Johnson K.A. Bryan T.M. Hill D.E. Markowitz S. Wilson J.K. Paraskewa C. Petersen G.M. Hamilton S.R. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2846-2850Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar)). The membrane was probed with APC(Ab-1)-FE9 monoclonal IgG (Oncogene Science). For p53 analysis, 50 μg of nuclear extracts were separated on 10% (w/v) SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The proteins were electroblotted on an Immobilon-P transfer membrane and probed with p53(DO-1) monoclonal IgG2a (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After incubation with secondary antibody, signals were detected by the ECL Western blotting detection reagent (Amersham Corp.). For nuclear run-on assay, cells were washed with Buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm MgCl2, 3 mm CaCl2, 3 mm DTT) containing 10% (w/v) sucrose. Cells were lysed in Buffer A containing 0.1 mm EDTA and 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40. The lysed cells were layered on the top of 68% (w/v) sucrose solution prepared in Buffer A. The nuclei were collected by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in a storage Buffer B (42 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 9.3 mm MgCl2, 210 mm KCl, 4.2 mm DTT, and 42% (v/v) glycerol). A 100-μl nuclear suspension containing 30 × 106 nuclei was mixed with 100 μl of transcript elongation mixture containing 250 μm each of GTP, CTP, and ATP and 100 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol). Forty units of RNase inhibitor, RNasin (Promega), was added in each tube. The nascent transcripts were elongated for 30 min at 30 °C. The32P-labeled RNA (2.5 × 106 cpm) was hybridized to 500 ng of EcoRI fragments of APCand 18 S RNA plasmids and poly(dI·dC), which were immobilized on a Hybond-N+ membrane. The hybridization conditions were the same as described for Northern blot analysis. The expected signals of Northern and Western blots of each experiment were quantified by personal densitometer SI (Molecular Dynamics). Data analysis and graphing were done either by Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software) or by Sigma Plot (Jandel Scientific). In the past few years, it has been clearly demonstrated that the tumor suppressor APC plays an important role in the development of colorectal cancer (3Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1996; 87: 159-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4286) Google Scholar). However, the biological function(s) of APC is poorly understood. To gain insight into the biological function(s) of APC, it is critical to understand the molecular mechanisms of theAPC gene expression. To examine the possibility of whether APC is inducible, an HCT-116 human colon cancer cell line, which expresses wild-type APC (18Groden J. Joslyn G. Samowitz W. Jones D. Bhattacharyya N. Spirio L. Thliveris A. Robertson M. Egan S. Meuth M. White R. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1531-1539PubMed Google Scholar), was exposed to DNA-damaging agents such as MNNG (50 μm), dimethylhydrazine (DMH, 250 μm), 3-morpholinosydnonimine (SIN-1, 100 μm), carboplatin (50 μm), melphalan (50 μm), mechlorethamine (1 μm), and ultraviolet (UV) light (5 J/m2). The APCmRNA levels were increased after treating cells with all of these DNA-damaging agents, indicating the global nature of this response (Fig. 1 A). The maximum increase in the APC mRNA level was observed with MNNG, which was used in subsequent experiments. A dose-dependent effect of treatment with MNNG on the induction of APCmRNA is shown in Fig. 1 B. Continuous exposure of HCT-116 cells to MNNG (50 μm) induced an 8–12-fold increase in the levels of both APC mRNA and protein in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1, C andD, respectively). To investigate the mechanisms regulating transcription ofAPC, cells were treated simultaneously with MNNG and actinomycin D (ActD) or with cycloheximide (CHX) for 15 h (Fig.2 A) to block transcription and new protein synthesis, respectively. Whereas treatment with ActD abolished MNNG's induction of APC mRNA expression, that treatment with CHX served to induce APC implicates a negative post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism involving a labile factor. To investigate the effect of MNNG treatment on the stability of the APC mRNA, the half-life (t½) of transcribed APC mRNA was determined in controlversus MNNG-treated cells by treatment with ActD (1 μg/ml) or buffer for different periods to block further transcription. The kinetics of APC mRNA degradation (t½ of 125–150 min) with or without MNNG indicated that the increased APC expression was not due to a post-transcriptional mechanism (Fig. 2 B). Nuclear run-on assays showed that nascent APC mRNA synthesis was higher in nuclei isolated from MNNG-treated versus control cells, whereas the rate of transcription for 18 S RNA remained unchanged (Fig.2 C). Collectively, these data establish that transcriptional rather than post-transcriptional mechanism(s) are involved in the regulation of APC after DNA alkylation damage. The expression of the tumor suppressor p53 is induced by a wide variety of DNA-damaging agents and has been proposed to play a necessary role in controlling transcription of the critical genes involved in cell cycle arrest and DNA replication (20Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6759) Google Scholar). Since APC is also involved in cell cycle arrest (21Baeg G.H. Matsumine A. Kuroda T. Bhattacharjee R.N. Miyashiro I. Toyoshima K. Akiyama T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5618-5625Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and we have discovered thatAPC expression is transcriptionally induced after DNA damage, we next examined a role for p53 in APC expression. Thus, if p53 is required for DNA damage-induced expression of APC, then cell lines defective in wild-type functional p53 should fail to up-regulate APC. Three cell lines with different p53 expression were selected: (i) the HCT-116 cell line expresses wild-type p53 (29Waldman T. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5187-5190PubMed Google Scholar); (ii) the HeLa S3 cell line expresses barely detectable levels of p53 protein (30Scheffner M. Werness B.A. Huibregtse J.M. Levine A.J. Howley P.M. Cell. 1990; 63: 1129-1136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3484) Google Scholar); (iii) the erythroleukemic K562 cell line is negative for the p53 gene and fails to express p53 protein (31Soddu S. Blandino G. Scardigli R. Coen S. Marchetti A. Rizzio M.G. Bossi G. Cimino L. Crescenzi M. Sacchi A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Analysis of RNA from these cells treated with different concentrations of MNNG for 15 h (Fig.3) indicated a tight correlation between the p53 status and the induction of steady-state levels ofAPC mRNA after MNNG treatment. The HCT-116 cell line showed a dose-dependent increase in the APCmRNA level (Fig. 3 A), whereas HeLa cells showed only a slight (i.e. <2-fold) increase in expression at 25–50 μm MNNG, and the basal level of APC expression in p53-negative K562 cells was unaffected by DNA damage (Fig.3 A). Since exposure of mammalian cells to DNA-damaging agents increases cellular levels of p53 protein (20Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6759) Google Scholar), we examined whether the increase in APC mRNA levels in HCT-116 cells after MNNG treatment was correlated with a simultaneous increase in p53 protein levels. The p53 protein levels were increased significantly in HCT-116 cells after treatment with MNNG (50 μm) but were not altered in HeLa cells (Fig. 3 B). These results suggest that APC expression is sensitive to, and may require, increased levels of p53. We observed that HCT-116 cells express a low level of p53 as well as APC, and both were found to be increased after MNNG treatment (Fig. 3). These results are consistent with the idea that p53 levels are limiting in HCT-116 cells, and the increased levels of p53 may be necessary for induced expression of APC. If this is the case, then overexpression of p53 in these cells should mimic the effect of MNNG treatment on the expression of APC. To test this idea, HCT-116 cells were transfected with CMV-p53 plasmid, and theAPC mRNA levels were determined by Northern blotting. As predicated, the APC mRNA levels of HCT-116 cells were increased in a dose-dependent manner after transfection with CMV-p53 plasmid (Fig.4 A). These results demonstrate that an increase in p53 protein level is required for APCgene expression after DNA damage. To evaluate whether p53 can regulate APC in K562 cells (p53-negative), a CMV-p53 plasmid construct was transiently transfected into these cells, and the expression of APC mRNA was determined. An increased level of p53 protein was determined by Western blotting in K562 cells after CMV-p53 transfection (data not shown). The total RNA was isolated from these cells and processed forAPC mRNA determination. The results show thatAPC mRNA levels were increased in a dose-dependent manner in CMV-p53-transfectedversus untransfected K562 cells (Fig. 4 B), clearly indicating that p53 expression can regulate APC gene expression. After DNA damage, increased levels of cellular p53 protein transcriptionally activate genes required for cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (20Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6759) Google Scholar). For example, p53 up-regulates expression of theWAF1/cip1 gene, which is a known inhibitor of cyclin/Cdk function (32Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 5: 805-816Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (5250) Google Scholar, 33El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7957) Google Scholar). The decreased cyclin/Cdk activity leads to hypophosphorylation of pRb, resulting in cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase (20Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6759) Google Scholar). In the present studies, WAF1/Cip1 protein levels remained unchanged after MNNG treatment of p53-expressing HCT-116 cells, whereas pRb levels significantly decreased (data not shown). These results suggest that p53-mediated MNNG-induced signaling does not involve WAF1/Cip1 or pRb. Since we observed a consistent requirement for p53 in APC up-regulation, it appears that a p53-mediated signaling pathway is required for APC regulation in response to DNA damage. Previous results indicated that wild-type APC-mediated cell cycle arrest (21Baeg G.H. Matsumine A. Kuroda T. Bhattacharjee R.N. Miyashiro I. Toyoshima K. Akiyama T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5618-5625Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and apoptosis (22Morin P.J. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7950-7954Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar) were p53-independent. However, since those studies were performed with cells that overexpressed recombinant APC, it is possible that high levels of the tumor suppressor APC could bypass a requirement for p53 upstream of APC regulation. Indeed, our results indicate that p53 is an upstream effector required for induced expression of APC in response to DNA damage. Recent studies have indicated that APC is an important component of the Wnt signaling pathway (3Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1996; 87: 159-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4286) Google Scholar, 14Rubinfeld B. Albert I. Porfiri E. Fiol C. Munemitsu S. Polakis P. Science. 1996; 272: 1023-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). In the absence of Wnt signals, APC interacts with and is phosphorylated by glycogen synthase kinase-3β, which regulates cellular levels of β-catenin and inhibits signaling by the β-catenin-Tcf/Lef complexes (15Korinek V. Barker N. Morin P.J. van Wichen D. de Weger R. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Clevers H. Science. 1997; 275: 1784-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2950) Google Scholar, 16Morin P.J. Sparks A.B. Korinek V. Barker N. Clevers H. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1997; 275: 1787-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3517) Google Scholar). These studies have suggested that in the absence of wild-type APC, β-catenin-Tcf/Lef complexes are stabilized and translocated into the nucleus, where they may activate transcription of the target genes, which might be involved in the development of colorectal cancer (15Korinek V. Barker N. Morin P.J. van Wichen D. de Weger R. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Clevers H. Science. 1997; 275: 1784-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2950) Google Scholar, 16Morin P.J. Sparks A.B. Korinek V. Barker N. Clevers H. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1997; 275: 1787-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3517) Google Scholar) as well as in melanoma (17Rubinfeld B. Robbins P. El-Gamil M. Albert I. Porfiri E. Polakis P. Science. 1997; 275: 1790-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar). Besides being a negative regulator of β-catenin signaling, APC has also been implicated in the migration of intestinal epithelial cells from the crypt up to the villi, where these cells undergo apoptosis. This physiological process is necessary to maintain the normal functioning of the intestinal cells (for review, see Ref. 28Peifer M. Science. 1997; 275: 1752-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Previous studies have suggested that free β-catenin blocks the APC-mediated cell migration. Thus increased levels of the wild-type APC and low levels of β-catenin can independently regulate gene expression by controlling the levels of β-catenin-Tcf/Lef complexes and similarly affect also the migration of epithelial cells. How DNA damage-induced APC levels play a role in these processes is currently unknown. Thus, our findings support the idea that DNA-damaging agents can induce transcription of the APC gene in a p53-dependent manner, which might perhaps inhibit β-catenin-Tcf/Lef complex signaling and also might play a role in cell migration and apoptosis. Nevertheless, the dependence of APC expression on p53 may be highly physiologically relevant in that a p53-APC connection may help to identify a functional role for the APC. Obviously, when the vital cell processes are dysfunctional, as in cells containing mutant APC and/or p53, then increased genetic instability results and may lead to the development of cancer (for reviews, see Refs. 3Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1996; 87: 159-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4286) Google Scholar and 34Cheng K.C. Loeb L.A. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1997; 221: 5-18PubMed Google Scholar). Increased APC levels may overcome this process, either by cell cycle arrest and DNA damage repair or by inducing apoptosis. We thank Drs. W.

Interestingly, the activation was suppressed not only by dominant negative Raf-1 but also by dominant negative Ras and SOS. Further analysis revealed that TPA treatment induced, dependently on protein kinase C, the mobility shift of p66 shc in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, which could be prevented by treatment of the Shc immunoprecipitate with serine/threonine-specific protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) or 2A (PP2A). Phosphoamino acid analysis of Shc showed that unlike growth factor-induced Shc phosphorylation, where Shc is mainly phosphorylated at tyrosine residues, TPA-induced phosphorylation was only at serine residues. Like growth factor-induced Shc phosphorylation, which leads to the association of Shc with Grb2, TPA also induced this association, but, correspondingly to the above results, the TPA-induced association was disrupted by in vitro treatment of the Shc immunoprecipitate with PP1. Taken together, these results suggest that the TPA signal was fed at or upstream of Shc to activate the Ras/ERK signaling pathway involving serine phosphorylation of Shc.

Ligand-activated growth factor receptors induce translocation of the Grb2-SOS complex to the plasma membrane where p21 ras is localized by two alternative mechanisms: directly by recruiting Grb2 via its SH2 domain (1van der Geer P.

In NIH3T3 fibroblasts protein kinase C phosphorylates Raf-1 and stimulates its kinase activity (9Kolch W. Heidecker G. Kochs G. Hummel R. Vahidi H. Mischak H. Finkenzeller G. Marme D. Rapp U.R.

Chem. 1997; 272: 3915-3923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We analyzed TPA-induced Ras/ERK signaling in the context of ERK-mediated gene regulation in NIH3T3 cells and found that the TPA signal is fed upstream of SOS and involves serine phosphorylation of Shc. The reporter plasmid pGL2 muPA-8.2 was constructed by inserting the murine urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) gene promoter (from −8, 200 to +398 with respect to the transcription initiation site) upstream of the luciferase-coding region of the promoter-less plasmid pGL2-basic (Promega). Expression vectors for various signaling molecules used in this work were previously described (12Besser D. Presta M. Nagamine Y. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1009-1017PubMed Google Scholar, 13Besser D. Urich M. Sakaue M. Messerschmitt A. Ballmer-Hofer K. Nagamine Y. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2383-2391PubMed Google Scholar) except that for constitutively active pPKCδ (14Hirai S. Izumi Y. Higa K. Kaibuchi K. Mizuno K. Osada S. Suzuki K. Ohno S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2331-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). NIH3T3 cells (0.1 × 106/well) were plated in 6-well (35-mm) tissue culture plates with 2 ml DMEM containing 10% CS and transfected 20 h later by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Luciferase expression was determined as described (13Besser D. Urich M. Sakaue M. Messerschmitt A. Ballmer-Hofer K. Nagamine Y. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2383-2391PubMed Google Scholar). NIH3T3 cells (1 × 106) were plated in 10-cm dishes and transfected 20 h later using 60 μl of LipofectAMINETM (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 15 μg of pcDNA-p44-tag encoding HA-tagged ERK-1 together with 15 μg of the coexpressed plasmid for 5 h. The cells were incubated in fresh DMEM with 10% CS for 5 h and in DMEM with 0.1% CS for 12 h. The cells were then treated with FGF-2 or TPA for 10 min and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Whole cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA-tag mouse monoclonal antibody (12CA5), and ERK activity was determined as described (15Graus-Porta D. Beerli R.R. Hynes N.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1182-1191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NIH3T3 cells stimulated for 10 min by TPA, FGF-2, or PDGF were immunoprecipitated as described (16Pérez L. Urich M. Passinen A. Senften M. Meili R. Ballmer-Hofer K. Virology. 1995; 208: 26-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) using a polyclonal anti-Shc antibody (Transduction Laboratories). The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blots using a monoclonal anti-Shc antibody (1:250; Transduction Laboratories) or a monoclonal anti-Grb2 antibody (1:500; Transduction Laboratories). An enhanced chemiluminescence detection method (Amersham) was employed, and the membrane was exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR film. NIH3T3 cells were grown to confluency on a 15-cm dish, starved for 16 h in phosphate-free DMEM containing 0.1% dialyzed calf serum, incubated for 4 h in the same medium with the addition of 2 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate, and then induced with 100 ng/ml TPA or 10 ng/ml FGF-2 for 10 min. Cell extracts were immunoprecipitated using polyclonal anti-Shc antibody, and the precipitates were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Each Shc isoform was recovered separately from the gel after autoradiography and subjected to phosphoamino acid analysis as described (17Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar). In NIH3T3 cells, the uPA gene is activated by TPA and FGF-2 via the Ras/ERK signaling pathway (12Besser D. Presta M. Nagamine Y. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1009-1017PubMed Google Scholar). To know where in the pathway the TPA signal is fed, we first examined the effects of various signaling molecules on uPA gene induction in transient transfection assays. The induction of the uPA promoter by TPA and FGF-2 was suppressed by dominant negative mutants of Ras (Ras17N) or Raf-1 (NΔRaf-1) or by mitogen-activated protein kinase-specific protein phosphatase MKP-1 (Fig. 1 A), confirming the involvement of the Ras/ERK pathway in uPA gene activation by TPA and FGF-2. Surprisingly, the induction by TPA was also suppressed by dominant negative mutants of SOS (ΔmSOS1, Fig.1 B), showing that TPA activates the Ras/ERK signaling pathway at or upstream of SOS. Wild-type SOS (mSOS1) enhanced both the basal and induced activities of the uPA promoter (Fig. 1 B). SOS is a GTP-GDP exchange factor which is able to activate Ras (18Burgering B.M. Bos J.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 18-22Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the induction of the uPA gene by constitutively active Ras or Raf was not suppressed by coexpression of ΔmSOS1 (data not shown), indicating that inhibitory effects of dominant SOS are not general on gene expression or protein synthesis. A constitutively active mutant of PKCδ (PKCδ RA) strongly activated the uPA promoter in the transient transfection assay, but the activation was not blocked by ΔmSOS1 (Fig. 1 C). NΔRaf-1 and wild-type MKP-1 were able to block this induction. These results show that PKCδ RA activates the pathway at a step downstream of SOS. It has been shown that PKCα phosphorylates Raf-1 at the same sites in a cell-free system which are phosphorylated in vivo (9Kolch W. Heidecker G. Kochs G. Hummel R. Vahidi H. Mischak H. Finkenzeller G. Marme D. Rapp U.R. Nature. 1993; 364: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (1157) Google Scholar). Accordingly, overexpressed PKCδ may activate Raf-1 directly in the cytoplasm without Ras-dependent translocation of Raf-1 to the membrane (19Ueda Y. Hirai S. Osada S. Suzuki A. Mizuno K. Ohno S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23512-23519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar), possibly because of an increase in the number of PKCδ molecules in the transfection assays described here. In the case of TPA induction, which activates several PKC isoforms including α and δ (20Leibersperger H. Gschwendt M. Marks F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16108-16115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the absolute number of PKC molecules is not elevated and, therefore, Ras-dependent translocation of Raf-1 to the membrane may still be needed for the induction. Both ΔmSOS1 and Ras17N strongly suppressed not only the uPA promoter activity but also the ERK-1 activity induced by TPA and FGF-2 (Fig.2 A). mSOS1 showed no inhibitory effect on ERK-1 activity, and constitutively active Ras (Ras61L) alone activated ERK-1 as strongly as TPA or FGF-2. The levels of tagged-ERK-1 expression were similar in different transfections (Fig. 2 B). Pretreatment of the cells for 18 h with an inhibitor of farnesylation, an obligatory step in Ras processing (21Gabbay R.A. Sutherland C. Gnudi L. Kahn B.B. O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. Flier J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1890-1897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), blocked TPA and FGF-2 stimulation of ERK-1 activity about 60% in both inductions (Fig. 2 C), proving again that the activation of Ras is necessary for activation of the ERK pathway by TPA and FGF-2. Translocation of the Grb2-SOS complex to the membrane is induced either by Shc or by a receptor tyrosine kinase. Shc activation involves its phosphorylation at a tyrosine residue and subsequently interaction with Grb2 (22Downward J. Graves J.D. Warne P.H. Rayter S. Cantrell D.A. Nature. 1990; 346: 719-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). Accordingly, both FGF-2 and PDGF, but not TPA, induced tyrosine phosphorylation of all three Shc isoforms (Fig.3 A). Interestingly, all three stimuli, TPA, FGF-2, and PDGF, led to a mobility shift of the p66 shc isoform (Fig. 3 B), suggesting an alternative modification on the Shc protein other than tyrosine phosphorylation after induction with these agents. To analyze the mobility shift of the p66 shc isoform, Shc was immunoprecipitated from cell extracts after stimulation of the cells with FGF-2 or TPA. The immunoprecipitates were treated with either calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (CIP), tyrosine-specific phosphatase LAR (23Streuli M. Krueger N.X. Thai T. Tang M. Saito H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2399-2407Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), or serine/threonine-specific protein phosphatase 2A (24Cohen P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2151) Google Scholar) (PP2A). Treatment with either CIP or PP2A, but not LAR, prevented the mobility shift of p66 shc (Fig. 3 C), suggesting that the shift is due to serine/threonine phosphorylation. TPA-induced mobility shift of p66 shc was also sensitive to serine/threonine-specific protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) (data not shown). The results in Fig. 3 Dshow that the mobility shift of p66 shc induced by TPA is dependent on protein kinase C; treatment of cells with the protein kinase C inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide (25Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grand-Perret T. Ajakane M. Baudet V. Boissin P. Boursier E. Loriolle F. Duhamel L. Charon D. Kirilovsky J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15771-15781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or TPA for 24 h down-regulating PKC prior to TPA treatment ablated the shift. The shift induced by FGF-2 was partially suppressed by both treatments, suggesting that serine/threonine phosphorylation of Shc after FGF-2 treatment also involves PKC isoforms, at least partially. Phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that TPA and FGF-2 induced phosphorylation of serine residues in p52 shc and p66 shc (Fig.3 E). Apparently, serine phosphorylation of p52 shc does not affect its mobility in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under the conditions used. In accordance with the result shown in Fig.3 A, phosphorylation of tyrosine residues was induced by FGF-2 but not by TPA. We were interested in whether the TPA-induced serine phosphorylation of Shc also promotes its association with Grb2. After immunoprecipitation of Shc from either TPA- or FGF-2-treated or untreated cells we could detect an increase in Grb2 association with Shc after 2 min of either treatment, which remained constant at least up to 30 min. The association between Shc and Grb2 shows a similar duration as the modification of the p66 shc . In accordance with the results described in Fig. 3, tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc was increased only after FGF-2 treatment (Fig.4 A). When Shc immunoprecipitates were treated with PP1, Grb2 association induced by TPA or FGF-2 was suppressed or strongly reduced, respectively (Fig.4 B). The PP1-specific inhibitor calyculin A suppressed the inhibitory effect of PP1. It has been well established that the major modification of Shc is the phosphorylation of Tyr317, which is induced by many receptor tyrosine kinases and cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases (Ref. 26Lotti L.V. Lanfrancone L. Migliaccio E. Zompetta C. Pelicci G. Salcini A.E. Falini B. Pelicci P.G. Torrisi M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1946-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar and references cited therein). Tyrosine-phosphorylated Shc recruits the Grb2-SOS complex to the membrane via the SH2 domain of Grb2, thus allowing SOS to activate Ras. The present results suggest that Shc can also recruit Grb2 through serine phosphorylation. An increase in serine phosphorylation of Shc as an Gβγ-induced event (27Touhara K. Hawes B.E. van Biesen T. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9284-9287Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) or in response to epidermal growth factor stimulation (28Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L. Grignani F. McGlade J. Cavallo F. Forni G. Nicoletti I. Pawson T. Pelicci P.G. Cell. 1992; 70: 93-104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar) has been observed, but its biological significance has not been addressed. It has been shown recently that serine phosphorylation of Raf-1 is involved its interaction with 14-3-3 protein (29Muslin A.J. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 889-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar) and that serine phosphorylation of Raf-1 is also involved in the recruitment of the Fyn SH2 domain (30Cleghon V. Morrison D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17749-17755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although it is not known whether this transduces signaling. Taken together, our results suggest that TPA can activate Ras/ERK signaling by inducing serine phosphorylation of Shc. It remains to be seen whether PKC phosphorylates Shc directly or indirectly and how the serine phosphorylation of Shc is able to promote the interaction of Shc with Grb2.
