Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) with antigen-specific T cells has shown remarkable clinical success; however, approaches to safely and effectively augment T cell function, especially in solid tumors, remain of great interest. Here we describe a strategy to 'backpack' large quantities of supporting protein drugs on T cells by using protein nanogels (NGs) that selectively release these cargos in response to T cell receptor activation. We designed cell surface–conjugated NGs that responded to an increase in T cell surface reduction potential after antigen recognition and limited drug release to sites of antigen encounter, such as the tumor microenvironment. By using NGs that carried an interleukin-15 super-agonist complex, we demonstrated that, relative to systemic administration of free cytokines, NG delivery selectively expanded T cells 16-fold in tumors and allowed at least eightfold higher doses of cytokine to be administered without toxicity. The improved therapeutic window enabled substantially increased tumor clearance by mouse T cell and human chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2878370351,"The neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) regulates a diverse array of physiological processes throughout the body. Despite its importance, cholinergic transmission in the majority of tissues and organs remains poorly understood owing primarily to the limitations of available ACh-monitoring techniques. We developed a family of ACh sensors (GACh) based on G-protein-coupled receptors that has the sensitivity, specificity, signal-to-noise ratio, kinetics and photostability suitable for monitoring ACh signals in vitro and in vivo. GACh sensors were validated with transfection, viral and/or transgenic expression in a dozen types of neuronal and non-neuronal cells prepared from multiple animal species. In all preparations, GACh sensors selectively responded to exogenous and/or endogenous ACh with robust fluorescence signals that were captured by epifluorescence, confocal, and/or two-photon microscopy. Moreover, analysis of endogenous ACh release revealed firing-pattern-dependent release and restricted volume transmission, resolving two long-standing questions about central cholinergic transmission. Thus, GACh sensors provide a user-friendly, broadly applicable tool for monitoring cholinergic transmission underlying diverse biological processes."
https://openalex.org/W2830247530,"Charisma is a term commonly used in conservation biology to describe species. However, as the term ""charismatic species"" has never been properly defined, it needs to be better characterized to fully meet its potential in conservation biology. To provide a more complete depiction, we collected information from four different sources to define the species currently considered to be the most charismatic and to understand what they represent to the Western public. First, we asked respondents of two separate surveys to identify the 10 animal species that they considered to be the most charismatic and associate them with one to six traits: Rare, Endangered, Beautiful, Cute, Impressive, and Dangerous. We then identified the wild animals featured on the website homepages of the zoos situated in the world's 100 largest cities as well as on the film posters of all Disney and Pixar films, assuming in both cases that the most charismatic species were generally chosen to attract viewers. By combining the four approaches, we set up a ranked list of the 20 most charismatic animals. The majority are large exotic, terrestrial mammals. These species were deemed charismatic, mainly because they were regarded as beautiful, impressive, or endangered, although no particular trait was discriminated, and species were heterogeneously associated with most of the traits. The main social characteristics of respondents did not have a significant effect on their choices. These results provide a concrete list of the most charismatic species and offer insights into the Western public's perception of charismatic species, both of which could be helpful to target new species for conservation campaigns."
https://openalex.org/W2818717431,"Background The potential of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) to reduce the cardiovascular and other disease risks of smoking is of great interest. While many smokers report using ENDS for cessation, their impact under real-world use patterns and conditions on adult smokers’ quitting behavior is uncertain. The objective of this study was to generate more recent and comprehensive evidence on the effect of “real world” ENDS use on the population quit rates of adult smokers while taking account of frequency and duration of use, device type, e-liquid flavor, and reasons for use. Methods and findings We conducted a population-based, prospective cohort study of a random probability sample of 1284 U.S. adult smokers recruited in August/September 2015 and re-contacted one-year later (September 2016) from GfK’s KnowledgePanel, a national, probability-based web-panel designed to be representative of non-institutionalized U.S. adults. Among the 1081 baseline smokers who remained members of KnowledgePanel, 858 completed the follow-up survey. The primary outcome was smoking abstinence for at least 30 days prior to follow-up. Secondary outcomes were making a quit attempt during the 12-month study period and number of cigarettes smoked per day at follow-up. The adjusted odds of quitting smoking were lower for those that used ENDS at baseline (9.4%, 95% CI = 5.22%-16.38%; AOR = 0.30, 95% CI = 0.13–0.72) compared to smokers who did not use at ENDS (18.9%, 95% CI = 14.24%-24.68%). Smokers who used ENDS daily at some point during the study period were also less likely to quit smoking than nonusers (AOR = 0.17; 95% CI = 0.04–0.82). Limited ability to draw causal inferences from the observational design and a lack of biochemical verification of quitting smoking or ENDS use are limitations of this study. Conclusions We found no evidence that ENDS use, within context of the 2015–2016 US regulatory and tobacco/vaping market landscape, helped adult smokers quit at rates higher than smokers who did not use these products. Absent any meaningful changes, ENDS use among adult smokers is unlikely to be a sufficient solution to obtaining a meaningful increase in population quit rates. Additional research is needed to reconcile the divergent literature and monitor the impact of ENDS in an environment of rapidly evolving markets and regulatory policies."

CH pathogenesis is poorly understood. Exome sequencing of 125 CH trios and 52 additional probands identified three genes with significant burden of rare damaging de novo or transmitted mutations: TRIM71 (p = 2.15 × 10−7), SMARCC1 (p = 8.15 × 10−10), and PTCH1 (p = 1.06 × 10−6). Additionally, two de novo duplications were identified at the SHH locus, encoding the PTCH1 ligand (p = 1.2 × 10−4). Together, these probands account for ∼10% of studied cases. Strikingly, all four genes are required for neural tube development and regulate ventricular zone neural stem cell fate. These results implicate impaired neurogenesis (rather than active CSF accumulation) in the pathogenesis of a subset of CH patients, with potential diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic ramifications.

These results implicate impaired neurogenesis (rather than active CSF accumulation) in the pathogenesis of a subset of CH patients, with potential diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic ramifications. Hydrocephalus has been defined as the active, progressive distension of the cerebral ventricular system resulting from inadequate passage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from its point of production to its point of absorption (Rekate, 2008Rekate H.L. The definition and classification of hydrocephalus: a personal recommendation to stimulate debate.Cerebrospinal Fluid Res. 2008; 5: 2Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This mechanism is evident in secondary hydrocephalus associated with brain tumors, infection, or hemorrhage, in which intracranial pressure is often elevated (Kahle et al., 2016Kahle K.T. Kulkarni A.V. Limbrick Jr., D.D. Warf B.C. Hydrocephalus in children.Lancet. 2016; 387: 788-799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, when infantile hydrocephalus occurs without a known antecedent, it is classified as primary or congenital hydrocephalus (CH) (Tully and Dobyns, 2014Tully H.M. Dobyns W.B. Infantile hydrocephalus: a review of epidemiology, classification and causes.Eur. J. Med. Genet. 2014; 57: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). CH can occur in the absence of obstruction to CSF flow (communicating hydrocephalus) or with complete/partial intraventricular obstruction (non-communicating hydrocephalus), most often due to aqueductal stenosis. Cases of communicating CH with normal or low intracranial pressure (Bret and Chazal, 1995Bret P. Chazal J. Chronic (“normal pressure”) hydrocephalus in childhood and adolescence.

CH is a major cause of childhood morbidity and mortality, affecting 1 in 1,000 live births (Munch et al., 2012Munch T.N. Rostgaard K. Rasmussen M.L. Wohlfahrt J. Juhler M. Melbye M.

Current therapy consists of catheter-based CSF shunting and endoscopic approaches, surgeries with high rates of failure and morbidity (Kahle et al., 2016Kahle K.T. Kulkarni A.V. Limbrick Jr., D.D.

Significant gaps in our understanding of the molecular pathophysiology of CH impede the development of preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic measures (McAllister et al., 2015McAllister 2nd, J.P.

These include L1CAM mutation in X-linked hydrocephalus and aqueductal stenosis (OMIM# 307000; Rosenthal et al., 1992Rosenthal A. Jouet M. Kenwrick S.

This has motivated whole-exome sequencing (WES) of large patient cohorts, searching for genes mutated in affected subjects more often than expected by chance.

We hypothesized that the apparent sporadic occurrence of CH may reflect, in some cases, damaging de novo mutations and/or transmitted mutations with incomplete penetrance. We recruited 177 probands with non-L1CAM-mutated CH in which hydrocephalus was the predominant phenotypic feature (see STAR Methods). All probands had undergone surgery for CSF diversion. The cohort included 125 parent-offspring sporadic CH trios, 47 singleton cases, and 5 multiplex kindreds (see STAR Methods; Table S1). 88 probands had communicating hydrocephalus and 89 had aqueductal stenosis. All study protocols were approved by the Yale Human Research Protection Program (HRPP) Institutional Review Board. DNA was isolated, and WES was performed (Timberlake et al., 2016Timberlake A.T.

We compared the observed and expected number of de novo mutations in all genes and among genes in the top quartile of brain expression at embryonic day 9.5 (E9.5; see STAR Methods). Protein-altering de novo mutations were significantly enriched over expectation in the latter group, contributing to an estimated 8% of cases (Table 1). Controls showed no enrichment of de novo mutations in any gene class (Table S3). Five genes contained two or more protein-altering de novo mutations: TRIM71, SMARCC1, PTCH1, PLOD2, and SGSM3 (Table S4). The first three genes have a probability of loss-of-function (LOF) intolerance (pLI) score ≥ 0.99; the latter two genes have pLIs of zero (Lek et al., 2016Lek M. Karczewski K.J. Minikel E.V.

The probability of finding five genes with two or more protein-altering de novo mutations in a cohort this size by chance is very low (p = 1.1 × 10−4). Four of these genes were in the upper quartile of expression in the developing brain.

During the course of this study, Hydro102-1 became pregnant and transmitted the p.Arg608His mutation to her son, who was prenatally diagnosed with communicating hydrocephalus (Figure 1; Figure S5). A third de novo TRIM71 mutation (p.Arg796His) was identified in Hydro100-1, who had prenatally diagnosed communicating CH (Hydro100-1). All CH patients harboring TRIM71 mutations underwent surgical CSF shunting at birth because of extreme ventriculomegaly. The probability of finding three or more protein-altering de novo mutations in TRIM71 by chance in a cohort of this size is 2.15 × 10−7, surpassing genome-wide significance (Table 2) (Ware et al., 2015Ware J.S.

https://openalex.org/W4238421997,"Hexokinase-II (HK2) is a key enzyme involved in glycolysis, which is required for breast cancer progression. However, the underlying post-translational mechanisms of HK2 activity are poorly understood. Here, we showed that Proviral Insertion in Murine Lymphomas 2 (PIM2) directly bound to HK2 and phosphorylated HK2 on Thr473. Biochemical analyses demonstrated that phosphorylated HK2 Thr473 promoted its protein stability through the chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) pathway, and the levels of PIM2 and pThr473-HK2 proteins were positively correlated with each other in human breast cancer. Furthermore, phosphorylation of HK2 on Thr473 increased HK2 enzyme activity and glycolysis, and enhanced glucose starvation-induced autophagy. As a result, phosphorylated HK2 Thr473 promoted breast cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, PIM2 kinase inhibitor SMI-4a could abrogate the effects of phosphorylated HK2 Thr473 on paclitaxel resistance in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, our findings indicated that PIM2 was a novel regulator of HK2, and suggested a new strategy to treat breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2877659745,"Lymphatic malformations (LM) are characterized by the overgrowth of lymphatic vessels during pre- and postnatal development. Macrocystic, microcystic and combined forms of LM are known. The cysts are lined by lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs). Resection and sclerotherapy are the most common treatment methods. Recent studies performed on LM specimens in the United States of America have identified activating mutations in the phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA) gene in LM. However, whole tissue but not isolated cell types were studied. Here, we studied LM tissues resected at the University Hospitals Freiburg and Regensburg, Germany. We isolated LECs and fibroblasts separately, and sequenced the commonly affected exons 8, 10, and 21 of the PIK3CA gene. We confirm typical monoallelic mutations in 4 out of 6 LM-derived LEC lines, and describe two new mutations i.) in exon 10 (c.1636C>A; p.Gln546Lys), and ii.) a 3bp in-frame deletion of GAA (Glu109del). LM-derived fibroblasts did not possess such mutations, showing cell-type specificity of the gene defect. High activity of the PIK3CA—AKT- mTOR pathway was demonstrated by hyperphosphorylation of AKT-Ser473 in all LM-derived LECs (including the ones with newly identified mutations), as compared to normal LECs. Additionally, hyperphosphorylation of ERK was seen in all LM-derived LECs, except for the one with Glu109del. In vitro, the small molecule kinase inhibitors Buparlisib/BKM-120, Wortmannin, and Ly294002, (all inhibitors of PIK3CA), CAL-101 (inhibitor of PIK3CD), MK-2206 (AKT inhibitor), Sorafenib (multiple kinases inhibitor), and rapamycin (mTOR inhibitor) significantly blocked proliferation of LM-derived LECs in a concentration-dependent manner, but also blocked proliferation of normal LECs. However, MK-2206 appeared to be more specific for mutated LECs, except in case of Glu109 deletion. In sum, children that are, or will be, treated with kinase inhibitors must be monitored closely."
https://openalex.org/W2866029803,"Looming visual stimuli result in escape responses that are conserved from insects to humans. Despite their importance for survival, the circuits mediating visual startle have only recently been explored in vertebrates. Here we show that the zebrafish thalamus is a luminance detector critical to visual escape. Thalamic projection neurons deliver dim-specific information to the optic tectum, and ablations of these projections disrupt normal tectal responses to looms. Without this information, larvae are less likely to escape from dark looming stimuli and lose the ability to escape away from the source of the loom. Remarkably, when paired with an isoluminant loom stimulus to the opposite eye, dimming is sufficient to increase startle probability and to reverse the direction of the escape so that it is toward the loom. We suggest that bilateral comparisons of luminance, relayed from the thalamus to the tectum, facilitate escape responses and are essential for their directionality."

The brain is a highly organized structure, harboring a great diversity of neurons linked by precise patterns of connectivity.

Cell-type-specific repertoires of cell surface molecules have long been postulated to play a major role in encoding specific connectivity (Sperry, 1963Sperry R.W. Chemoaffinity in the orderly growth of nerve fiber patterns and connections.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1963; 50: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (1371) Google Scholar).

The extracellular leucine-rich repeat superfamily; a comparative survey and analysis of evolutionary relationships and expression patterns.BMC Genomics. 2007; 8: 320Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) suggests that these proteins may not necessarily regulate core synaptic functions but rather contribute to assembling complex patterns of connectivity in the mammalian nervous system. The significance of LRR protein diversity is not understood, however, and might simply be a matter of redundancy. Alternatively, the LRR proteins expressed in a neuron might localize to each of its inputs in distinct combinations and contribute to specifying structural and functional properties of those inputs. Distinguishing between these possibilities requires an analysis of mRNA and protein distribution, combined with a systematic molecular dissection and analysis of synaptic structure and function, at the single-cell level in intact neural circuits. Here, we investigate how LRR adhesion molecule diversity contributes to the specification of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neuron input properties. We investigate a small repertoire of three LRR proteins of different families, all of which are expressed in CA1 neurons, and each of which promotes excitatory synapse development in culture. FLRT2, LRRTM1, and Slitrk1 differentially distribute to the two major excitatory inputs on the CA1 apical dendrite (Figure 1A). At proximal Schaffer collateral (SC) inputs, all three LRR proteins are postsynaptic. Despite similar roles in vitro, knockdown (KD) of each LRR protein differentially affects SC input development. FLRT2 controls spine density and its loss alters synaptic transmission accordingly. LRRTM1 and Slitrk1 exert opposing effects on synaptic vesicle distribution at the AZ, altering EPSC charge and quantal content. Combinatorial loss of all three proteins results in a cumulative phenotype. At distal temporoammonic (TA) inputs, FLRT2 and Slitrk1 regulate functional synapse number and AMPA glutamate receptor density, respectively, whereas LRRTM1 is absent. Our data indicate a modular, rather than a redundant, organization of LRR protein-mediated synaptic adhesion, with input-specific combinations of LRR proteins conferring synapse identity. To investigate the role of LRR protein diversity in specifying synaptic properties, we identified a small LRR protein repertoire in the main hippocampal output neuron, the CA1 pyramidal neuron (Figure 1A), and determined mRNA and protein distribution in these cells. We used the Allen Brain Atlas to survey LRR gene expression in the CA1 region, and selected three CA1-expressed LRR proteins based on the following criteria designed to identify distinct ligand-LRR receptor pairs: (1) LRR proteins had to belong to different subfamilies with a similar role in promoting excitatory synapse development in cultured neurons, (2) they had to be postsynaptically localized at excitatory synapses, (3) each had to bind to a distinct presynaptic partner, and (4) working antibodies for immunohistochemical detection had to be available. Based on these criteria, we selected fibronectin leucine-rich repeat transmembrane 2 (FLRT2), leucine-rich repeat transmembrane neuronal 1 (LRRTM1), and SLIT/NTRK family-like 1 (Slitrk1) for our analysis (Figure 1F). All are postsynaptic proteins belonging to synaptogenic LRR subfamilies, and each binds to a different presynaptic partner (Figure 1F): latrophilin (LPHN) for FLRT2 (O’Sullivan et al., 2012O’Sullivan M.L. de Wit J.

USA. 2013; 110: 4057-4062Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). To determine whether individual CA1 neurons co-express all three LRR genes, we performed single-molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization (smFISH) on postnatal day 35 (P35) rat hippocampal sections using custom-designed probes for Flrt2, Lrrtm1, and Slitrk1. All three LRR genes were expressed in CA1 stratum pyramidale (SP) (Figures 1B and 1D). Higher-magnification images revealed fluorescent labeling for Flrt2, Lrrtm1, and Slitrk1 mRNAs in individual CA1 cells, and image quantification showed that 94.02% ± 0.57% of individual CA1 cells contained puncta for each mRNA (Figures 1C and 1E). Negative control sections did not show fluorescent signal, demonstrating the specificity of the probes used (Figure S1A). Abundance of the three LRR mRNAs was correlated in CA1 cells (Figure S1B). These results indicate that single CA1 neurons co-express multiple synaptogenic LRR genes. To determine whether LRRTM1, FLRT2, and Slitrk1 proteins are uniformly distributed along the apical dendrites of CA1 neurons or display lamina-specific distributions indicative of an input-specific localization, we labeled rat brain cryosections with primary antibodies for each LRR protein. The antibodies used did not cross react with other members of each protein family, and FLRT2 and LRRTM1 antibodies did not detect a band in knockout mouse hippocampal extracts (Figures S1C–S1G). Western blot analysis of rat hippocampal membrane extracts showed that FLRT2, LRRTM1, and Slitrk1 proteins were expressed from early postnatal development onward (Figure S1H). Immunolabeling of cryosections with LRR protein antibodies and synaptic markers revealed distinct distributions for FLRT2, LRRTM1, and Slitrk1 proteins in mature hippocampus (Figures 1G and 1H). FLRT2 immunoreactivity was largely restricted to the CA1 region. LRRTM1 and Slitrk1 were more broadly expressed and displayed striking lamina-specific patterns, especially in the case of LRRTM1. To quantify the laminar distributions of FLRT2, LRRTM1, and Slitrk1 in CA1, we measured protein intensity along the axis of CA1 apical dendrites in stratum radiatum (SR), containing SC inputs, and stratum lacunosum-moleculare (SLM), containing TA inputs (Figure 1A). FLRT2 was expressed at a similar intensity in both SR and SLM (Figures 1H and 1I). LRRTM1 intensity abruptly decreased from SR to SLM, whereas Slitrk1 intensity increased in SLM compared to SR (Figures 1H and 1I). Analysis of LRR protein distribution at different developmental stages showed that FLRT2 and LRRTM1 CA1 laminar distribution patterns were established by P14, whereas Slitrk1 intensity in SR still increased between P14 and P21 (Figures S2A–S2F). Together, these results show that single CA1 neurons co-express Flrt2, Lrrtm1, and Slitrk1. FLRT2, LRRTM1, and Slitrk1 differentially distribute to the two major inputs on CA1 apical dendrites. High-zoom images revealed a punctate pattern for all three LRR proteins in SR. FLRT2, LRRTM1, and Slitrk1 puncta overlapped with the postsynaptic marker PSD-95 and were opposed to the presynaptic marker Bassoon (Figure 1J), confirming a postsynaptic localization. Isolated LRR protein puncta may represent extrasynaptically or intracellularly localized protein. Immunohistochemical staining with the inhibitory postsynaptic marker Gephyrin revealed minimal overlap in SR (Figure S2G), indicating that FLRT2, LRRTM1, and Slitrk1 are predominantly localized to excitatory synapses. Whether individual SC synapses contain more than one type of LRR protein is not known. Simultaneous analysis of the distribution of these LRR proteins within the same section was not possible due to species incompatibility of the antibodies used. To address this question, we performed single LRR protein immunolabeling on cryosections from rat brains injected with small volumes of lentiviral vectors expressing a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter to sparsely label CA1 neurons. Sections were co-labeled with a PSD-95 antibody, and GFP-positive dendritic segments in SR were imaged on a confocal microscope equipped with an Airyscan detector and reconstructed in 3D (STAR Methods) (Figures 2A–2C). Analysis of LRR protein localization at PSD-95-positive spines revealed that 60.4% ± 4.1% (mean ± SEM) contain detectable immunoreactivity for FLRT2, 68.8% ± 3.5% for LRRTM1, and 55.2% ± 4.2% for Slitrk1. Probability measurements based on these values indicate that the chance of a PSD-95-positive spine lacking FLRT2, LRRTM1, and Slitrk1 is low at 5.5% and that the probability of all three LRR proteins localizing to the same PSD-95-positive spine is highest at 22.9% (Figure S2H), showing that individual SC synapses likely contain multiple types of LRR proteins. To start dissecting the individual contributions of FLRT2, LRRTM1, and Slitrk1 to synapse function in CA1 neurons, we designed lentiviral vectors harboring a GFP reporter and short hairpin RNA (shRNA) to KD expression of each LRR protein. We tested efficacy of shFLRT2, shLRRTM1, and shSlitrk1 in transfected HEK293T cells (Figures S3A–S3C) and verified that all shRNAs effectively reduced endogenous LRR protein levels in cultured rat neurons (Figures 3A–3C). We injected small volumes of lentiviral vectors into the CA1 region of P0 rat pups to achieve sparse transduction of pyramidal neurons (Figures 3D and 3E) and cut acute slices for electrophysiological recordings between P13 and P19. Infected CA1 pyramidal cells were identified by GFP epifluorescence, and simultaneous whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings were made from neighboring infected and non-infected cells (Figure 3F). We first measured spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) in CA1 neurons using whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings at −70 mV. Both FLRT2 KD (Figures 3G and 3H) and LRRTM1 KD (Figures 3J and 3K) caused a decrease in sEPSC frequency compared to control cells. In contrast, Slitrk1 KD increased sEPSC frequency (Figures 3M and 3N). Loss of FLRT2, LRRTM1, or Slitrk1 did not affect sEPSC amplitude (Figures 3I, 3L, and 3O). Cells infected with control lentivirus containing the GFP reporter alone or with control lentivirus containing a non-targeting shRNA and GFP showed no changes in any of these parameters (Figures S4A–S4F). Thus, LRR protein KD differentially affects the frequency of spontaneous synaptic transmission in CA1 neurons. To assess the role of FLRT2, LRRTM1, and Slitrk1 specifically at SC inputs, where all three LRR proteins are postsynaptically localized (Figures 1H–1J and 2A–2C), we performed simultaneous whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings from neighboring infected and non-infected CA1 cells while evoking SC inputs with a stimulating electrode in SR (Figure S4G). Cells were voltage clamped at a holding potential of −60 mV to measure AMPA receptor (AMPAR)-mediated EPSCs and subsequently clamped at +40 mV to measure NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-mediated EPSCs 100 ms after stimulus onset. FLRT2 KD strongly and proportionally reduced the amplitude of AMPAR- and NMDAR-mediated EPSCs compared to control neurons (Figures 4A–4D). In contrast, neither LRRTM1 KD (Figures 4E–4H) nor Slitrk1 KD (Figures 4I–4L) affected AMPAR or NMDAR EPSC amplitude. Cells infected with either of the two control lentiviruses showed no differences in any of these parameters (Figures S4I–S4P). To further verify that the effect of FLRT2 KD on AMPAR and NMDAR EPSC amplitude was specific, we infected CA1 neurons with a lentiviral rescue vector expressing shFLRT2 and an shRNA-resistant FLRT2 cDNA containing three silent mutations in the shRNA target region (FLRT2∗ rescue) (Figures S3D and S3G). AMPAR and NMDAR EPSC amplitude in FLRT2∗ rescue-infected neurons did not differ from non-infected cells (Figures 4M–4P), indicating specificity of the FLRT2 shRNA. Thus, FLRT2 KD selectively decreases evoked AMPAR and NMDAR EPSCs at SC inputs. The reduction in EPSC amplitude following FLRT2 KD could result from a decrease in presynaptic release probability, a decrease in the number of functional synapses, or changes in the postsynaptic response to glutamate. To begin exploring how loss of LRR proteins affects these synaptic parameters, we first tested whether FLRT2 KD alters the probability of release at SC inputs. We measured the paired-pulse ratio (PPR) at a range of inter-stimulus intervals but observed no changes in PPR following FLRT2 KD (Figures S5A and S5B), indicating that a change in release probability does not underlie the decrease in evoked EPSC amplitude. PPR was also not affected following LRRTM1 or Slitrk1 KD (Figures S5C–S5F) or infection with two control viruses (Figures S5M–S5P). Thus, loss of FLRT2, LRRTM1, or Slitrk1 does not alter initial presynaptic release probability at SC inputs. To further probe the effect of FLRT2, LRRTM1, or Slitrk1 KD on evoked transmission at SC inputs, we performed train stimulations of 200 stimuli at 5, 10, and 20 Hz in simultaneously recorded infected and neighboring, non-infected neurons. First, we compared the normalized, synchronous release component during train stimulations to assess coupling between presynaptic activity and the instantaneous synaptic response. No changes in release kinetics during train stimulations were found following FLRT2, LRRTM1, or Slitrk1 KD (Figures S5G–S5L; 10 Hz and 20 Hz data not shown). In addition to synchronous release, periods of elevated synaptic activity increase residual calcium, which culminates in less coordinated, delayed release called asynchronous release. When we analyzed the cumulative total charge, including both synchronous and asynchronous release, we observed differences for all conditions. FLRT2 KD decreased the cumulative total charge of train EPSCs relative to control neurons (Figure 4Q), consistent with the decrease in absolute evoked EPSC amplitude for this condition (Figures 4A and 4C). Surprisingly, LRRTM1 KD resulted in an even more pronounced decrease in cumulative total EPSC charge (Figure 4R). Slitrk1 KD showed the opposite effect and resulted in an increased cumulative total charge (Figure 4S). Cells infected with control lentiviruses showed no differences in any of these parameters (Figures S5Q–S5V). Neurons infected with viruses expressing FLRT2∗ rescue, shLRRTM1 and shRNA-resistant LRRTM1 (LRRTM1∗ rescue), or shSlitrk1 and shRNA-resistant Slitrk1 (Slitrk1∗ rescue) (Figures 4T–4V; Figures S3E, S3F, S3H, and S3I) showed no difference in cumulative total charge compared to non-infected cells (Figures 4W–4Y), indicating specificity of the observed effects. Taken together, sustained stimulation reveals differential effects of FLRT2, LRRTM1, or Slitrk1 KD on total evoked synaptic transmission from SC inputs. FLRT2 KD decreases AMPAR and NMDAR EPSC amplitude as well as cumulative total charge during trains. LRRTM1 or Slitrk1 KD do not affect single evoked EPSC amplitude, but loss of LRRTM1 decreases—whereas Slitrk1 KD increases—cumulative total charge during sustained train stimulations. Thus, the effect of FLRT2 KD is distinct from that of LRRTM1 or Slitrk1 KD, and LRRTM1 and Slitrk1 KD have opposing effects on evoked synaptic transmission. The proportional reduction in EPSC amplitude (Figures 4C and 4D), decrease in cumulative total charge (Figure 4Q), and normal PPR (Figures S5A and S5B) in FLRT2 KD neurons are consistent with a reduced number of synapses. LRRTM1 or Slitrk1 KD does not alter single evoked EPSC amplitude (Figures 4G and 4K), but cumulative total charge changes in opposite directions (Figures 4R and 4S), suggesting more complex underlying phenotypes. We therefore next examined to what extent the observed changes in evoked synaptic transmission at SC inputs following LRR protein KD could be explained by changes in synapse number. We injected lentiviral vectors into the CA1 region of P0 rat pups and imaged P14 secondary apical CA1 dendrites in SR on a structured illumination microscope followed by analysis of dendritic spine density. FLRT2 KD caused a strong, 47.3% decrease in dendritic spine density compared to dendrites from CA1 neurons infected with control lentivirus (Figures 5A and 5B ). LRRTM1 KD caused a small, 13.4% reduction in spine density (Figures 5A and 5B). We observed no change in spine density following Slitrk1 KD (Figures 5A and 5B). Spine shape was not detectably altered in any of the KD conditions (Figure S6A). These results indicate that loss of each LRR protein differentially affects dendritic spine density in CA1 SR: FLRT2 KD robustly decreases spine density, LRRTM1 KD causes a minor decrease, and Slitrk1 KD does not alter spine density. The reduction in spine density following FLRT2 KD is consistent with the proportional decrease in EPSC amplitude and decrease in cumulative total charge, indicating a role for FLRT2 in regulating SC synapse number. LRRTM1 or Slitrk1 KD had a minor or no effect on spine density (Figures 5A and 5B), respectively, but loss of these proteins altered cumulative total EPSC charge in opposite directions (Figures 4R and 4S). To gain more insight into the LRRTM1 KD and Slitrk1 KD phenotypes, we next analyzed the quantal properties of transmission at SC inputs following LRRTM1 or Slitrk1 KD. We replaced Ca2+ in the extracellular solution with Sr2+, which enters the presynaptic terminal through calcium channels and triggers neurotransmitter release, albeit with lower efficiency (Bekkers and Clements, 1999Bekkers J.M. Clements J.D. Quantal amplitude and quantal variance of strontium-induced asynchronous EPSCs in rat dentate granule neurons.J. Physiol. 1999; 516: 227-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, Oliet et al., 1996Oliet S.H. Malenka R.C. Nicoll R.A. Bidirectional control of quantal size by synaptic activity in the hippocampus.Science. 1996; 271: 1294-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The lower release efficiency in combination with a longer retention time of Sr2+ results in delayed, asynchronous release after stimulation, allowing analysis of isolated quantal events from stimulated SC afferents. We simultaneously recorded asynchronous EPSCs (aEPSCs) in infected and neighboring, non-infected CA1 neurons. aEPSC frequency provides information about quantal content—the number of vesicles released in response to a stimulus—whereas aEPSC amplitude provides information about quantal size—the synaptic response to release of a single vesicle. LRRTM1 KD decreased aEPSC frequency compared to control neurons (Figures 6A–6C). Slitrk1 KD, on the other hand, increased aEPSC frequency (Figures 6F–6H). Neither affected aEPSC amplitude (Figures 6D, 6E, 6I, and 6J), indicating that loss of LRRTM1 or Slitrk1 does not alter quantal size due to, e.g., changes in synaptic vesicle size, vesicle filling, or the number of glutamate receptors at each synapse. The opposing effects of LRRTM1 or Slitrk1 KD on aEPSC frequency indicate a decrease and increase, respectively, in quantal content. This can result from a change in release probability, functional synapse number, or organization of synaptic vesicles. As LRRTM1 or Slitrk1 KD did not affect PPR or synchronous release kinetics, a change in release probability cannot explain the differences in quantal content. As LRRTM1"

Aberrant expression of microRNAs is strongly implicated in gastric tumorigenesis; however, their contribution in response to H. pylori infection has not been fully elucidated. In this study, we evaluated the expression of miR-135b-5p and its role in gastric cancer. We describe the overexpression of miR-135b-5p in human gastric cancer tissue samples compared with normal tissue samples. Furthermore, we found that miR-135b-5p is also up-regulated in gastric tumors from the trefoil factor 1-knockout mouse model. Infection with H. pylori induced the expression of miR-135b-5p in the in vitro and in vivo models. miR-135b-5p induction was mediated by NF-κB. Treatment of gastric cancer cells with TNF-α induced miR-135b-5p in a NF-κB–dependent manner. Mechanistically, we found that miR-135b-5p targets Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) and binds to its 3′ UTR, leading to reduced KLF4 expression. Functionally, high levels of miR-135b-5p suppress apoptosis and induce cisplatin resistance. Our results uncovered a mechanistic link between H. pylori infection and miR-135b-5p-KLF4, suggesting that targeting miR-135b-5p could be a potential therapeutic approach to circumvent resistance to cisplatin.—Shao, L., Chen, Z., Soutto, M., Zhu, S., Lu, H., Romero-Gallo, J., Peek, R., Zhang, S., El-Rifai, W.

This chronological difference implies a different level of sport experience and performance due to developmental and maturational processes. The aim of the present study was to analyze the relative age effect in elite u-18 basketball according to playing positions. The variables analyzed were: date of birth, playing position and technical-tactical performance indicators in basketball (TTPI). A descriptive analysis was carried out to characterize the sample, a lineal regression was used to analyze the influence of the date of birth on basketball performance and finally an ANOVA and discriminant analysis were performed to identify the differences among different playing positions. The results show the existence of the RAE in the top European Under-18 basketball competition (S1 = 67%; S2 = 33%). Performance indicators which are predictors of the birth quarter (p< .05) were only found in the small forwards (defensive rebounds (β: -.463) and fouls received (β: -.140)) and in the centers (three point throws scored (β: -.321) and tried (β: .342)). These results may be of use for coaches and clubs when recruiting players for each playing position. Older forwards and centers are capable of performing at a higher level. Therefore, clubs have to sign up those players born at the beginning of the year."
https://openalex.org/W2846869971,"We reveal a central role for chance neuronal events in the decision of a male fly to court, which can be modeled as a coin flip with odds set by motivational state. The decision is prompted by a tap of a female with the male's pheromone-receptor-containing foreleg. Each tap evokes competing excitation and inhibition onto P1 courtship command neurons. A motivating dopamine signal desensitizes P1 to the inhibition, increasing the fraction of taps that successfully initiate courtship. Once courtship has begun, the same dopamine tone potentiates recurrent excitation of P1, maintaining the courtship of highly motivated males for minutes and buffering against termination. Receptor diversity within P1 creates separate channels for tuning the propensities to initiate and sustain courtship toward appropriate targets. These findings establish a powerful invertebrate system for cue-triggered binary decisions and demonstrate that noise can be exploited by motivational systems to make behaviors scalable and flexible."

Pyramidal neurons in CA1 are the last components of the trisynaptic pathway that, together with principal neurons in the dentate gyrus and CA3, forms the major route of information flow through the hippocampus (Andersen, 1975Andersen, P. (1975). Organization of Hippocampal Neurons and Their Interconnections. In: Isaacson, R.L. and Pribram, K.H. (eds) The Hippocampus. Springer. pp. 155–175. 10.1007/978-1-4684-2976-3_7.Google Scholar). CA1 pyramidal neurons receive information from within this network via the CA3 Schaffer collaterals and from the entorhinal cortex via the temporoammonic pathway. The mechanisms for memory storage are generally attributed to intrinsic plasticity and long-term potentiation (LTP) at synapses of participating neurons of the network (Benito and Barco, 2010Benito E.

A number of studies of hippocampal circuitry have led to the idea that memories generated from entorhinal cortical inputs are influenced by neuromodulators such as acetylcholine (Hasselmo, 1995Hasselmo M.E.

At least 20 different types of inhibitory interneurons with different properties have been described in CA1; some target different portions of the pyramidal cells, whereas others target interneurons (Klausberger and Somogyi, 2008Klausberger T. Somogyi P. Neuronal diversity and temporal dynamics: the unity of hippocampal circuit operations.Science. 2008; 321: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (1431) Google Scholar).

Among the latter, oriens lacunosum-moleculare (OLM) cells have their soma located in the stratum oriens and send axonal projections to the distal dendrites of pyramidal cells in stratum lacunosum-moleculare, where inputs from the temporoammonic pathway arrive (Leão et al., 2012Leão R.N.

OLM interneurons differentially modulate CA3 and entorhinal inputs to hippocampal CA1 neurons.Nat. Neurosci. 2012; 15: 1524-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). OLM cells are thus positioned to control the entrance of multimodal information from the entorhinal cortex into the hippocampus. Notably, OLM cells that specifically express the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor α2 subunit (encoded by the Chrna2 gene) form a genetically defined population of neurons in the CA1 region of the intermediate hippocampus (OLMα2 cells) (Leão et al., 2012Leão R.N. Mikulovic S. Leão K.E. Munguba H. Gezelius H. Enjin A. Patra K. Eriksson A. Loew L.M. Tort A.B.L. Kullander K. OLM interneurons differentially modulate CA3 and entorhinal inputs to hippocampal CA1 neurons.Nat. Neurosci. 2012; 15: 1524-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Interestingly, OLMα2 cells receive direct cholinergic transmission and respond to nicotine (Leão et al., 2012Leão R.N. Mikulovic S. Leão K.E. Munguba H. Gezelius H. Enjin A. Patra K. Eriksson A. Loew L.M. Tort A.B.L. Kullander K. OLM interneurons differentially modulate CA3 and entorhinal inputs to hippocampal CA1 neurons.Nat. Neurosci. 2012; 15: 1524-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), and acetylcholine has been implicated in learning and memory processes (Elvander et al., 2004Elvander E. Schött P.A. Sandin J. Bjelke B. Kehr J. Yoshitake T. Ögren S.O. Intraseptal muscarinic ligands and galanin: influence on hippocampal acetylcholine and cognition.Neuroscience. 2004; 126: 541-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, Tian et al., 2015Tian S. Pan S. You Y. Nicotine enhances the reconsolidation of novel object recognition memory in rats.Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav. 2015; 129: 14-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Of note, a previous study has shown that inhibition—but not stimulation—of somatostatin-positive cells in the dorsal hippocampus, many of which are OLM cells, prevents fear learning (Lovett-Barron et al., 2014Lovett-Barron M. Kaifosh P. Kheirbek M.A. Danielson N. Zaremba J.D. Reardon T.R. Turi G.F. Hen R. Zemelman B.V. Losonczy A. Dendritic inhibition in the hippocampus supports fear learning.Science. 2014; 343: 857-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, since the hippocampus is functionally segregated between the dorsal and the ventral parts (Fanselow and Dong, 2010Fanselow M.S. Dong H.-W. Are the dorsal and ventral hippocampus functionally distinct structures?.Neuron. 2010; 65: 7-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2114) Google Scholar), it is possible that OLM cells play different roles across the dorsoventral axis. Consistent with this idea, nicotine has opposite effects in the dorsal and ventral hippocampus: while nicotine administration in the dorsal hippocampus enhances contextual fear memory, administration in the ventral hippocampus impairs it (Kenney et al., 2012Kenney J.W. Raybuck J.D. Gould T.J. Nicotinic receptors in the dorsal and ventral hippocampus differentially modulate contextual fear conditioning.Hippocampus. 2012; 22: 1681-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In the present work, we sought to further investigate the role of OLM cells in memory processes. To that end, we activated or silenced OLMα2 cells in the intermediate hippocampus in freely moving Chrna2-cre mice in the novel object recognition and contextual passive avoidance tasks. To study the role of OLMα2 cells in learning, we crossbred Chrna2-cre with tdTomato reporter mice to visualize red fluorescent Chrna2-cre-expressing cells in the hippocampus (Figure 1). Corroborating our previous study (Leão et al., 2012Leão R.N. Mikulovic S. Leão K.E. Munguba H. Gezelius H. Enjin A. Patra K. Eriksson A. Loew L.M. Tort A.B.L. Kullander K. OLM interneurons differentially modulate CA3 and entorhinal inputs to hippocampal CA1 neurons.Nat. Neurosci. 2012; 15: 1524-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), the tomato protein was specifically expressed in OLM cells—that is, interneurons with their soma in stratum oriens and massive projections to stratum lacunosum-moleculare (Figure 1 and Video S1). We delivered the light-gated proton pump archaeorhodopsin (Arch) or the cation channel channelrhodopsin (ChR2) via bilateral injection of double-floxed, inverted, open-reading-frame, adeno-associated viral vectors (Figures 1A and 1B). Since it was previously shown that OLM cells fire in phase with theta activity in vivo (Forro et al., 2015Forro T. Valenti O. Lasztoczi B. Klausberger T. Temporal organization of GABAergic interneurons in the intermediate CA1 hippocampus during network oscillations.Cereb. Cortex. 2015; 25: 1228-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), we chose stimulation at 8 Hz, an average theta frequency. By use of the clarity method (Chung and Deisseroth, 2013Chung K. Deisseroth K. CLARITY for mapping the nervous system.Nat. Methods. 2013; 10: 508-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar), we estimated the number of OLMα2 cells reached on each side to 338 out of a total of 3,124 in the cleared hippocampus based on our measured light power at ∼1.5 mW/mm2 at 1 mm, which should suffice to induce activity (Video S1; Histed and Maunsell, 2014Histed M.H. Maunsell J.H.R. Cortical neural populations can guide behavior by integrating inputs linearly, independent of synchrony.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111: E178-E187Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Successfully infected OLMα2 cells also expressed the virally encoded yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) (Figure 1A). Post-experiment analysis confirmed the targeted location of viral injections and insertion of the light probe into the intermediate hippocampus (Figure 1). We performed patch-clamp recordings to corroborate that OLMα2 cells became responsive to light. Green light inhibited spiking in OLMα2 cells expressing Arch (Figure 1C), and conversely, rhythmic application of blue light at 8 Hz increased spiking in OLMα2 cells expressing ChR2 (Figure 1H). We examined the expression of the immediate early gene c-Fos following light stimulation of Arch- or ChR2-expressing OLMα2 cells in freely moving animals implanted with optical fibers (Figures 1D–1G and 1I–1K; see STAR Methods). The number of c-Fos immunopositive cells after in vivo light stimulation in Arch animals (Chrna2-cre mice injected with Arch virus) was significantly lower than in injected control Chrna2-cre negative mice (Figure 1G). The number of cells in the stratum oriens that became immunopositive for c-Fos after in vivo light stimulation in ChR2 animals (Chrna2-cre mice injected with ChR2 virus) was significantly higher than in control mice (Figure 1K). These results demonstrate that optogenetic tools can control OLMα2 cell activity in freely moving animals. eyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiI5ZGY4ZDE4MzY2NDVmMTRmOWE3NzBiOGE2NTYzNjkxOSIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc5MDUyOTI2fQ.UK2qjnkYoGE_urTvMS0CYHE83WBw6e21zl7DHgPEoZchsXjZNYaR83kWYP9Szv8XzdKTnd-CfUcr70QKb2b8AAn-Yf0FE76BcwqAbHRY5S7DjcoKKolRQFcQ1a2d7MgPDc_OjHGa79YJXgSD-pv8_3eakQfaV_4-3dbjskBt-0deOHGiVZD--z_o7HjFWIwfQfZkYh_FfQntZYuKRqzgAfrEQx4TvPlajU4n2Q9s21dDMwhRoZz4Om6UqwKID8qHYMhx3ZG8BHAD-C87TjD4HpZvdt05w0dceSXd0MVdUNlv141vDm8WSWR-NcqRJg8nAfB69pPyNJvj9bFJy4ixBQ Download .mp4 (66.83 MB) Help with .mp4 files Video S1, Related to Figure 1Video of cleared tissue showing distribution of Chrnα2+ cells in the left hippocampus of a Chrnα2-cre/R26tdTomato mouse. Note the labeling of cell bodies in the stratum oriens and the massive projections in the stratum lacunosum-moleculare, which characterize OLMα2 cells. The video also shows the location of the optic fiber tip and an estimation of the light spread (green sphere). The recognition of novel objects constitutes a test of episodic-like memory and is impaired in rodents with hippocampal lesions (Antunes and Biala, 2012Antunes M. Biala G.

Heyser C. Spontaneous object recognition: a promising approach to the comparative study of memory.Front. Behav. Neurosci. 2015; 9: 183Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We next tested whether OLMα2 cells play a role in a novel object recognition task in which animals explored two different objects during 10 minutes in two sessions, named training and test sessions. We first subjected mice to experimental protocols in which—in the training session—a computer coupled to a detection system delivered blue light to both hippocampi of control and ChR2 animals during exploration of one of the two objects (lit object) but not during exploration of the other object (non-lit; Video S2). In the test session performed 24 hr later, the mice were re-exposed to one familiar and one new object. In the protocol named “non-lit object replaced,” animals were exposed to the previously lit object and a new object in the test session. Control animals spent more time exploring the new object than ChR2 animals, who explored the new and the previously lit object equally (Figure 2A; Tables S1 and S2), indicating impairment in object recognition. In a control experiment (“lit object replaced”), animals were exposed to the non-lit object and a new object, i.e. two objects not previously associated with OLMα2 cell modulation. In this protocol, both ChR2 and control animals spent more time exploring the new object, with no difference between groups (Figure 2B; Tables S1 and S2). Thus, light-stimulation of OLMα2 cells during training selectively impaired encoding of memory for the lit object. eyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiI2ZGRjZjA3NmJhM2JiMzY3N2Q5MDdiYWMwZWNjZjgwYiIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc5MDUyOTI2fQ.draktVJX6A-8gtZa8I25heAdtxZJ4NLFuHBTnL0Afw2lkvAvPl3JVoDZNFRQmMYI4GkcJIV4UuDnwp4t4zbsvWRB_oTZqSfTpQSpPqBxJWkAop-bu-N4J9ARcArWfjpodnUNEvH312_68hLTJIN2dCb7rQPY1h5JYlOC7oi3nm3f0NoCYfwo4c22kd2Wk8qpKYVMCRn9N_DBhI8SthUWuqjlQFGDOt3i-4w8GCzrEnqsGcV46S-jnNgew0UTKuZzaf2utMlQ9lnbljsgvMwlJ41kSGyo1edk3lZgmd1B-vH-7XRMSip7XFMtkBTyEHScHQOamqTfKy8qsF2ayCQiPw Download .mp4 (11.85 MB) Help with .mp4 files Video S2, Related to Figure 2Example of object exploration during a training session of the novel object recognition task. One of the objects is paired with light delivery (lit object), whereas the other object is not (non-lit object). Since the length of the intersession interval relates to performance in the object recognition test (Hammond et al., 2004Hammond R.S. Tull L.E. Stackman R.W. On the delay-dependent involvement of the hippocampus in object recognition memory.Neurobiol. Learn. Mem. 2004; 82: 26-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar), we next investigated whether activating OLMα2 cells would also impair object recognition with an intersession interval of 1 hr. We found similar results as in the 24-hr protocols: ChR2 animals spent equal time with the new and previously lit object, but they recognized the non-lit object (Figures 2C and 2D; Tables S1 and S2). Having found that acute activation of OLMα2 cells during the training session impaired learning, we wondered whether learning could be improved by instead inhibiting OLMα2 cells. To investigate this possibility, we delivered green light during training to mice whose OLMα2 cells expressed Arch (Arch animals). In the test session with the non-lit object replaced, both Arch and control animals exhibited preference for the new object (Table S2). Remarkably, Arch animals spent significantly more time exploring the new object than the previously lit object as compared to control animals (Figure 2E; Tables S1 and S2). We also noticed a lower variability between individual animals displaying high object discrimination in the Arch group. In contrast, replacing the lit object with a new object did not result in any significant differences between groups, and both control and Arch animals exhibited a preference for the new object (Figure 2F; Table S2). Thus, light inhibition of OLMα2 cells selectively improved discrimination for the lit object. Together, the results show that OLMα2 cells can bidirectionally modulate learning. Next, we wanted to investigate whether the effect of OLMα2 cell stimulation was due to those cells’ direct participation in encoding, and we therefore performed protocols with stimulation out of the encoding phase. Light stimulation of OLMα2 cells after the training session did not produce any measurable differences between ChrR2 animals and controls, with both groups showing the expected exploration preference for the novel object in the test session (Figure 3A; Tables S1 and S2). Next, to examine whether the effect of OLMα2 cell stimulation was directly linked to a specific object and not due to stimulation of a spatial component of the field, we stimulated OLMα2 cells when animals were in the arena while disengaged from object exploration. This had no effect on the object preference in the test session (Figure 3B; Tables S1 and S2). Interestingly, and consistent with our findings above, ChR2 but not control animals explored the lit object significantly more when both the lit and non-lit objects were kept in the test session (Figure 3C; Tables S1 and S2); this suggests that ChR2 animals perceived the previously lit object as a new object. Finally, we tested whether light stimuli delivered during both training and test sessions would impact object exploration. Such stimulation protocol did not result in any differences between ChrR2 animals and controls, with both groups showing exploration preference for the novel object in the test session (Figure 3D; Tables S1 and S2). Rodents depend on the integrity of the hippocampus to produce contextual fear memories (Rudy and Matus-Amat, 2005Rudy J.W. Matus-Amat P.

Previous studies have shown that CA1 is involved in contextual fear conditioning (Corcoran et al., 2005Corcoran K.A. Desmond T.J. Frey K.A. Maren S.

Dendritic inhibition in the hippocampus supports fear learning.Science. 2014; 343: 857-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). We next investigated whether OLMα2 cells may also be involved in the encoding of fear-related memories using a passive inhibitory avoidance task. For this, we used an arena with a brightly lit and a dark compartment (Figure 4A). During training sessions, the animals received a dual foot shock in the dark compartment to acquire an aversion to this normally preferred compartment in future exposures to the arena (test sessions). ChR2 animals that were light-stimulated during training displayed significantly lower latency to enter the dark compartment in the test sessions compared to control animals (Figure 4B; Table S3; Video S3). In contrast, mice whose OLMα2 cells expressed Arch and who were light inhibited during the training sessions showed no difference in latency or velocity compared to controls (Figure 4C; Table S3). Thus, whereas inhibition of OLMα2 cells had no effect, activation of OLMα2 cells impaired aversive memory encoding. eyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiIwZGY5NzNiNDlhYjNhNDY2MTI5NjJjNmRjZTliMWQwNyIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc5MDUyOTI2fQ.M6dzk-nuAwaXYEGvHPBtEFrgAD85GdKCuWKUeGFFDYOKG2P24D-a1IGWhynFUhJKFJDqevPY9q5rZF0QlKBB6w7VCNFhdfz8JiG43CTkC7D5Uq5J6_PZiw2Nz0O9MU_aFiLUqiz_ULAc-p5Q7DZhDqWabsZQqjcVirB4w3bYkgxu2pfMLek_nR755xqrWGI7HXQLQtaork_wDQTiDLHWuCGuhhU_YJ0hWH_-plJ3O9B3S6Kd1Az6cKF0m2utazYD7acuarnjcqH1Ap2igIRuu0AwRaRzeJUE4atNSTFwSmlBCxfdXsRRcNFcN9zrUeAepSNNtww_3eMAEjFWl-gLDQ Download .mp4 (20.79 MB) Help with .mp4 files Video S3, Related to Figure 4Example of the passive inhibitory avoidance task and the behavior of two animals (control and ChR2) during training and test sessions. Note that the control animal enters the dark chamber during the training session, but not during the test session, while the ChR2 animal enters the dark chamber during both training and test sessions. Inhibition of dorsal somatostatin-positive OLM interneurons attenuates fear learning (Lovett-Barron et al., 2014Lovett-Barron M. Kaifosh P. Kheirbek M.A. Danielson N. Zaremba J.D. Reardon T.R. Turi G.F. Hen R. Zemelman B.V. Losonczy A. Dendritic inhibition in the hippocampus supports fear learning.Science. 2014; 343: 857-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), which is at first glance at odds with our results. Since the test paradigm used in that study differed from the one used here, we modified our protocol and tested the influence of optogenetic modulation to ChR2 and Arch animals in a 5-second period encompassing the foot shock (Figure 4D). For both groups of animals, we did not find any significant differences during training or testing; the re-entry latencies were similar to the control groups (Figures 4E and 4F), suggesting that this type of manipulation onto intermediate OLMα2 cells was insufficient to influence fear learning. It also suggests that activation of intermediate OLMα2 cells could attenuate the memory of the shock when it was paired with the context—i.e,. the chamber—but not when confining OLMα2 cell activation only to the shock event. This begins to suggest that the dorsal and intermediate part of the CA1 may process encoding and retrieval differently. To further investigate these differences, we repeated the novel object recognition and passive inhibitory avoidance tests with animals that received viral injections and light-mediated inhibition in the dorsal hippocampus (Archdorsal; see STAR Methods). In contrast to the results obtained when inhibiting the intermediate CA1 (Figure 2C), we did not find that Archdorsal animals spent more time exploring the new object than the previously lit object compared to control animals (Figure 5A). However, Archdorsal animals exhibited lower latency to enter the dark chamber than control groups in the passive inhibitory avoidance task (Figure 5B; Table S3), consistent therefore with the findings of Lovett-Barron et al., 2014Lovett-Barron M. Kaifosh P. Kheirbek M.A. Danielson N. Zaremba J.D. Reardon T.R. Turi G.F. Hen R. Zemelman B.V. Losonczy A. Dendritic inhibition in the hippocampus supports fear learning.Science. 2014; 343: 857-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar and in contrast to the results obtained for inhibition of OLMα2 cells in the intermediate CA1 (Figure 4C). To gain further insight into the functional differences between the dorsal and intermediate hippocampus, we examined the response of OLMα2 cells to the cholinergic agonist nicotine. In in vitro slice experiments, we found that intermediate OLMα2 cells showed a much greater depolarization in response to nicotine than the dorsal counterparts (Figures 5C and 5D), suggesting differential cholinergic influence based on dorsoventral location. Our results suggest that OLMα2 cells in the CA1 region of the intermediate hippocampus can modulate learning of either object or fear-related representations. Acute light-mediated activation of intermediate OLMα2 cells resulted in decreased learning when animals were tested for object recognition as well as fear-related memories. In contrast, light-mediated inhibition improved object recognition but did not affect fear-related memories. In CA1, the intrahippocampal input from CA3 projects onto proximal apical dendrites of pyramidal cells, whereas the direct external input from the entorhinal cortex contacts the distal apical tuft dendrites (Kajiwara et al., 2008Kajiwara R.

Here, we show that presynaptic boutons that form onto basal dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons display a decrease in active zone (AZ) size with distance from the soma, resulting in a distance-dependent increase in short-term facilitation. Our findings suggest that the spatial distribution of short-term facilitation serves to compensate for the electrotonic attenuation of subthreshold distal inputs during repeated stimulation and fine-tunes the preferred input frequency of dendritic domains. Pyramidal neurons receive thousands of excitatory inputs on their extensive dendritic arbors. As a consequence, neurons need strategies to balance the strength of their synaptic inputs so that signals arriving at distal synapses, far from the soma, have a meaningful contribution to neuronal output. Active dendritic integration can greatly boost synaptic signals by amplifying local depolarizations onto dendritic spikes that travel to the soma. Much has been done to describe this phenomenon, and its regulation, by focusing on postsynaptic compartments. In particular, previous studies have characterized the distribution of the size and strength of postsynaptic spines within dendritic domains and have established their contributions to dendritic integration (Branco and Häusser, 2010Branco T.

What emerges is a complex picture of synapse distribution along dendritic arbors that appear to favor either local (dendritic) or global (cell-wide) integration, depending on dendrite identity. On the other hand, we know much less about the structural and functional distribution of presynaptic boutons (de Jong et al., 2012de Jong A.P. Schmitz S.K. Toonen R.F. Verhage M. Dendritic position is a major determinant of presynaptic strength.J. Cell Biol. 2012; 197: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and the role they play in shaping the integration of synaptic inputs on dendrites and their subdomains (Chabrol et al., 2015Chabrol F.P. Arenz A. Wiechert M.T. Margrie T.W. DiGregorio D.A. Synaptic diversity enables temporal coding of coincident multisensory inputs in single neurons.Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18: 718-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Critically, whereas postsynaptic strength establishes the amount of local dendritic depolarization, changes in presynaptic structure and function determine the dynamics of neurotransmitter release, through short-term forms of plasticity. This feature, in turn, governs the type of information that is transmitted across a synapse (Branco and Staras, 2009Branco T. Staras K. The probability of neurotransmitter release: variability and feedback control at single synapses.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2009; 10: 373-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, Fioravante and Regehr, 2011Fioravante D. Regehr W.G. Short-term forms of presynaptic plasticity.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2011; 21: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). To understand how dendrites integrate synaptic inputs, it is therefore important to first uncover how presynaptic boutons and the dynamics of neurotransmitter release are distributed along dendrites. A non-random distribution that echoes that of postsynaptic spines could lead to specialized dendritic domains that code for specific streams of information. Thus, short-term forms of plasticity that govern the release of neurotransmitter across different presynaptic boutons may have profound effects on how information is processed in postsynaptic dendrites (Abrahamsson et al., 2012Abrahamsson T. Cathala L. Matsui K. Shigemoto R. Digregorio D.A. Thin dendrites of cerebellar interneurons confer sublinear synaptic integration and a gradient of short-term plasticity.Neuron. 2012; 73: 1159-1172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). More globally, short-term plasticity (STP) has been shown to play many important roles in vivo (Regehr, 2012Regehr W.G. Short-term presynaptic plasticity.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2012; 4: a005702Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) and, in excitatory synapses of the hippocampus, STP is thought to contribute to the transmission of information about an animal’s place field (Kandaswamy et al., 2010Kandaswamy U. Deng P.Y. Stevens C.F. Klyachko V.A. The role of presynaptic dynamics in processing of natural spike trains in hippocampal synapses.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 15904-15914Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, Klyachko and Stevens, 2006Klyachko V.A. Stevens C.F. Excitatory and feed-forward inhibitory hippocampal synapses work synergistically as an adaptive filter of natural spike trains.PLoS Biol. 2006; 4: e207Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Understanding the dynamics of neurotransmitter release in hippocampal presynaptic boutons will therefore also have implications for how information is encoded by CA1 neurons during active behaviors. Here, we show that presynaptic boutons decrease in size along the basal dendrites of CA1 hippocampal neurons, resulting in a decrease in release probability and an increase in short-term facilitation with distance from the soma. We reveal that this spatial distribution in STP tunes dendritic domains to specific information frequencies, introducing a further level of specialization to dendritic computations. We set out to map the distribution of the structure and function of presynaptic terminals in CA1 stratum oriens, a region of the hippocampus that receives ordered axonal inputs that are mostly perpendicular to the basal dendrites of pyramidal neurons (Andersen et al., 1980Andersen P. Silfvenius H. Sundberg S.H. Sveen O. A comparison of distal and proximal dendritic synapses on CAi pyramids in guinea-pig hippocampal slices in vitro.J. Physiol. 1980; 307: 273-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). We first performed Serial Block-Face Scanning Electron Microscopy (SBFSEM) of three regions of CA1 stratum oriens from a P22 brain, ranging from deep (close to the stratum pyramidale) to superficial (close to alveus) areas and reconstructed basal dendrites together with their synaptic inputs (Figures 1A–1C). Although dendritic segments showed a wide distribution in the size of excitatory inputs, we found, as expected, a strong correlation between morphological measures of presynaptic and postsynaptic compartments (Figure S1) (Holderith et al., 2012Holderith N. Lorincz A. Katona G. Rózsa B. Kulik A. Watanabe M. Nusser Z. Release probability of hippocampal glutamatergic terminals scales with the size of the active zone.Nat. Neurosci. 2012; 15: 988-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, Schikorski and Stevens, 1997Schikorski T. Stevens C.F. Quantitative ultrastructural analysis of hippocampal excitatory synapses.J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 5858-5867Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In agreement with the notion that basal dendrites taper toward tip ends (Menon et al., 2013Menon V. Musial T.F. Liu A. Katz Y. Kath W.L. Spruston N. Nicholson D.A. Balanced synaptic impact via distance-dependent synapse distribution and complementary expression of AMPARs and NMDARs in hippocampal dendrites.Neuron. 2013; 80: 1451-1463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), we also saw a decrease in dendrite diameter along the stratum oriens with increasing distance away from stratum pyramidale (Figure 1D; n = 35, mean = prox 0.75 ± 0.03 μm, med 0.65 ± 0.02 μm, dist 0.61 ± 0.01 μm, p < 0.001 Kruskal-Wallis test, prox-dist adjusted p < 0.001 Dunn’s multiple comparison test). Importantly, of the many structural features measured at the synapse (Figure S1), AZ area, a good predictor of release probability (Holderith et al., 2012Holderith N. Lorincz A. Katona G. Rózsa B. Kulik A. Watanabe M. Nusser Z. Release probability of hippocampal glutamatergic terminals scales with the size of the active zone.Nat. Neurosci. 2012; 15: 988-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), showed a strong decrease in size with distance along stratum oriens (Figure 1E; n = 604, mean = prox 0.074 ± 0.003 μm2, med 0.058 ± 0.002 μm2, dist 0.061 ± 0.003 μm2, p < 0.0001 Kruskal-Wallis test; prox-med adjusted p < 0.001, prox-dist adjusted p < 0.001 Dunn’s multiple comparison test). Dendrite diameter, which can be taken as an indirect measure of distance from the soma along a tapering dendrite, also correlated well with AZ size (Figures 1F and 1G), providing further evidence that presynaptic terminals become smaller with distance along a basal dendrite. A reconstruction of proximal and distal dendrites performed on an adult brain (P100) showed a very similar distribution of presynaptic and postsynaptic properties with distance (Figures 1H–1K, Figure S1), indicating that the decrease in AZ size (and other synaptic parameters) was not unique to adolescent (P22) brains. Our dataset has some limitations, including the inability to follow the same dendrite from a single cell and to establish the identity of the inputs that arrive at different locations. We therefore turned to dissociated hippocampal neurons, where synaptic inputs can be labeled and followed along a single dendrite and where input identity is jumbled following the dissociation procedure. We find that measures of both presynaptic structure (vGlut labeling) and function (FM4-64 labeling of recycling vesicles) also decreased in a graded manner with distance along a dendrite (Figure S2). Together, these data suggest that the distance-dependent distribution of presynaptic inputs may be independent of the identity of the axon and is likely constrained by the properties of the postsynaptic dendrite. AZ size is thought to correlate well with release probability (Pr) (Holderith et al., 2012Holderith N. Lorincz A. Katona G. Rózsa B. Kulik A. Watanabe M. Nusser Z. Release probability of hippocampal glutamatergic terminals scales with the size of the active zone.Nat. Neurosci. 2012; 15: 988-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, Murthy et al., 2001Murthy V.N. Schikorski T. Stevens C.F. Zhu Y.

Stevens C.F. Quantitative ultrastructural analysis of hippocampal excitatory synapses.J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 5858-5867Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, Pr is tightly coupled to the dynamics of neurotransmitter release during a burst of action potentials, such that high Pr synapses undergo short-term depression, whereas low Pr synapses exhibit short-term facilitation (Dobrunz and Stevens, 1997Dobrunz L.E. Stevens C.F. Heterogeneity of release probability, facilitation, and depletion at central synapses.Neuron. 1997; 18: 995-1008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). This correlation between Pr and STP prompted us to measure neurotransmitter release dynamics along basal dendrites. We therefore patch clamped and filled CA1 pyramidal neurons with a fluorescent dye (Alexa 594) to visualize the basal dendritic arbor and measure synaptic inputs along its dendrites. Two stimulating pipettes were positioned along the basal dendrite, one at a site proximal to the soma and one distal to it (Figure 2A). In agreement with our structural findings (Figure 1), synaptic AMPA receptor currents measured by stimulating either proximal or distal axons independently showed that distal inputs facilitated more than proximal ones (Figures 2B and 2C). The paired-pulse ratio (PPR) of the first two stimuli delivered at 20 Hz was larger for distal inputs (mean = 1.59 ± 0.05) compared to proximal ones (mean = 1.33 ± 0.05) and remained higher throughout the 5 pulse stimulus train (Figures 2C and 2D). To establish whether the observed differences in STP were affected by postsynaptic properties, such as the inactivation or saturation state of AMPA receptors, we used cyclothiazide (CTZ, a drug that prevents AMPAR desensitization [Partin et al., 1993Partin K.M. Patneau D.K. Winters C.A. Mayer M.L. Buonanno A.

Vyklicky Jr., L. Mayer M.L. Hippocampal neurons exhibit cyclothiazide-sensitive rapidly desensitizing responses to kainate.J.

Variability of neurotransmitter concentration and nonsaturation of postsynaptic AMPA receptors at synapses in hippocampal cultures and slices.Neuron. 1999; 22: 395-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar]) to directly assess any contributions to STP by postsynaptic receptors (Figure 2E). Neither drug had any effect on the difference in STP between distal and proximal inputs (CTZ PPR = prox 1.18 ± 0.09, dist 1.51 ± 0.09, n = 9, p = 0.01; γDGG PPR = prox 1.36 ± 0.07, dist 1.64 ± 0.09, n = 13, p < 0.01; two-way ANOVA for control, CTZ, and γDGG, interaction p = 0.84), although there was a positive trend of γDGG on facilitation (Figure S3) that could reflect multivesicular release during the train (Christie and Jahr, 2006Christie J.M.

Multivesicular release at climbing fiber-Purkinje cell synapses.Neuron. 2001; 32: 301-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). To further corroborate that these effects were indeed presynaptic in origin, we performed similar measures of PPR in transgenic mice where synaptotagmin 7 (Syt 7) was knocked out. Syt 7−/− mice have been shown to lack any facilitation (Jackman et al., 2016Jackman S.L. Turecek J. Belinsky J.E. Regehr W.G. The calcium sensor synaptotagmin 7 is required for synaptic facilitation.Nature. 2016; 529: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) and should therefore abolish the differences in PPR measured here. We find that whereas WT mice show the same distance-dependent increase in PPR observed above, Syt7−/− littermates show neither facilitation nor any obvious difference in PPR between proximal and distal domains (Figure 2F). Together, our data point to a presynaptic origin in the difference in PPR along basal dendrites. To confirm the location specificity of our stimulus pipettes, we measured the kinetics of synaptic transmission at the soma. In agreement with the electrotonic decay of signals along a dendrite (Mainen et al., 1996Mainen Z.F. Carnevale N.T. Zador A.M. Claiborne B.J. Brown T.H.

Dendritic attenuation of synaptic potentials and currents: the role of passive membrane properties.Trends Neurosci. 1994; 17: 161-166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), we confirmed that distal stimuli (mean = 1.66 ± 0.07 ms) elicited slower events than proximal stimuli (mean = 1.23 ± 0.09 ms; p < 0.001, Wilcoxon sign rank test; Figure 2G). Since both the rise time and time to peak of events are directly related to the distance from the recording pipette at the soma, we looked at their relationship with PPR across different cells. A positive correlation emerged between synaptic kinetics and PPR (Figure 2H and Figures S3F and S3G, n = 49), suggesting a gradual change in PPR along a dendrite. Indeed, a positive correlation was also observed when PPR was plotted against the absolute distance of the stimulating electrode from the soma (Figure 2I). Our structural observations (Figure 1) predict that distal synapses will have a lower release probability (Pr) than proximal ones (Holderith et al., 2012Holderith N. Lorincz A. Katona G. Rózsa B. Kulik A. Watanabe M. Nusser Z. Release probability of hippocampal glutamatergic terminals scales with the size of the active zone.Nat. Neurosci. 2012; 15: 988-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), which may, in turn, help account for the increased levels of distal facilitation. To test for this, we used the irreversible open-channel blocker of NMDA receptors (NMDARs), MK-801, to measure Pr at proximal and distal compartments (Figure 2J). We recorded NMDAR currents in the presence of MK-801 in response to successive stimuli to measure the gradual block of NMDAR channels. The decay was best fit by a double exponential function, with a fast and a slow phase, indicating at least two groups of synapses with high and low release probabilities, respectively (Hessler et al., 1993Hessler N.A. Shirke A.M. Malinow R. The probability of transmitter release at a mammalian central synapse.Nature. 1993; 366: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). The two time constants were very similar for proximal and distal dendrites (proximal, τ1: 1.44 and τ2: 14.64; distal, τ1: 1.37 and τ2: 16.14), but in distal dendrites a larger fraction of the decay was explained by the slower time constant (proximal: 49%; distal: 69%). The overall slower decay observed in distal dendrites (mean half-life, proximal: 7.28 ± 1.2, distal: 13.99 ± 3.03, n = 8, p = 0.027, paired t test) indicates that synaptic NMDARs experienced less neurotransmitter in response to successive stimuli and therefore belong to synapses with, on average, a lower Pr than those found in proximal dendrites (Figure 2J). These findings mirror the structural correlation of presynaptic AZ size with dendrite diameter (Figures 1G and 1K) and strengthen our hypothesis that both the structure and function of presynaptic boutons display a distance-dependent distribution along basal dendrites. Furthermore, the lack of cross-inhibition by MK-801 between proximal and distal inputs is further support for the specificity of our stimulating electrodes in recruiting axons that form connections locally (Figure S3). Finally, we also established the frequency range over which inputs showed facilitation. We found that distal inputs showed significantly larger facilitation than proximal ones over a limited frequency range, between 10 and 50 Hz (Figures 2K and S3), with a peak at 20 Hz (PPR means = 5 Hz, prox 1.13 ± 0.04, dist 1.05 ± 0.04; 10 Hz, prox 1.18 ± 0.06, dist 1.35 ± 0.05; 20 Hz, see above; 50 Hz, prox 1.24 ± 0.07, p < 0.01 dist 1.53 ± 0.07, p < 0.01; 80 Hz, prox 1.17 ± 0.12, dist 1.22 ± 0.08). So far, our data show that distal inputs are tuned to band-pass frequencies in the near gamma frequency range, which curiously match the high-frequency discharges measured in vivo in hippocampal place cells when an animal passes through a place field (Huxter et al., 2003Huxter J. Burgess N. O’Keefe J. Independent rate and temporal coding in hippocampal pyramidal cells.Nature. 2003; 425: 828-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). To establish whether the biased distribution in short-term facilitation can influence dendritic integration and neuronal output, we performed current-clamp experiments and locally stimulated either proximal or distal afferents, as above. We found that stimulation of distal inputs at frequencies that showed increased facilitation (20 Hz), also showed a tendency to produce non-linear summations to multiple stimuli across the range of stimulation intensities (Figures 2L and 2M). This effect was less pronounced in proximal dendrites, where non-linear events were only observed for high stimulus intensities. The difference in integration properties between proximal and distal events has been shown to depend on the opening of NMDARs (Ariav et al., 2003Ariav G. Polsky A. Schiller J.

NMDA spikes in basal dendrites of cortical pyramidal neurons.Nature. 2000; 404: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar), which are more likely to be activated at the high impedance distal dendrites, where levels of depolarization to a given input are higher. We found that distal inputs are better suited to respond to multiple stimuli than to a single stimulus. This was apparent when comparing responses along a paired pulse. The second stimulus of a 20 Hz pair was consistently more likely to summate in a supralinear manner, when compared either to the first stimulus or to stimuli delivered at 5 Hz (Figures 2L and 2M). Together, our data show that the integration properties of distal domains are markedly different from proximal ones and depend on input frequency. Although there are many factors that likely play a role in driving these differences in dendritic integration, STP is an obvious candidate. To explore this further, we turned to a computational model where we could directly assess the role played by STP on the integration properties of different dendritic domains. We built a model consisting of a cluster of proximal and distal synapses (15 each; Figure 3A), where STP was adjusted to match our data (Figure 3B). This simple model aims to first determine the impact that a distance-dependent STP gradient can have on dendritic integration, when all other variables are the same. Activating either proximal or distal synapses separately with Poisson input trains delivered at different mean frequencies elicited non-linear responses (Figure 3C). Distal inputs, however, showed larger levels of membrane depolarization compared to proximal ones, over a large frequency range (continuous lines in Figure 3D). This distal amplification of synaptic inputs was partially lost when distal synapses were switched to proximal STP properties, suggesting that increased levels of facilitation enhance supralinear integration in distal dendrites. Interestingly, the difference in STP along a dendrite not only played a role in modulating dendritic non-linearities, it also contributed to distance-dependent input normalization; removal of active conductances from the model showed similar levels of membrane depolarization for distal and proximal inputs, which was lost when distal synapses were tuned to proximal STP properties (dashed lines in Figure 3D; note that the red and blue dashed lines overlap). This result suggests that the gradient in STP can boost distal inputs to counteract the effects of passive decay. Finally, increased levels of facilitation also resulted in an increased variance of membrane responses over a limited frequency domain, given by the short-term dynamics of the synapse (Figure 3E). This model shows that the STP gradient can have a significant impact on synaptic input integration, mainly exploiting differences in the recruitment of dendritic non-linearities. As such, it will act alongside other mechanisms that impact on non-linear integration, such as synaptic conductances, impedance, or release probability, all of which can also display gradients. However, models that include additional gradients of these other variables showed that the input-output curve remains biased toward larger depolarizations at higher frequencies in distal dendrites (Figure S4), indicating that the magnitude of the STP gradient that we observe is sufficient to have a significant impact on dendrite integration across a variety of conditions. Together, these simulations support the idea that distal inputs have an increased capacity for information transfer that is boosted by the short-term dynamics of neurotransmitter release from presynaptic inputs. Our findings uncovered a gradient in the distribution of presynaptic terminals along dendrites that dictates the short-term dynamics of synaptic transmission. This spatial gradient in short-term facilitation serves to both normalize the distance-dependent decay in the amplitude of subthreshold inputs to repeated stimuli, as well as tune the preferred input frequency of different dendritic domains through supralinear integration. As a result, the type of information transmitted across a synapse will depend on its location along a dendrite, an arrangement that could be exploited by different input streams to achieve input-specific differential integration on the same dendrite. Previous studies have shown that pre- and post-synaptic compartments are well matched, both structurally and functionally (Kay et al., 2011Kay L. Humphreys L. Eickholt B.J. Burrone J.

Our findings of a spatial bias in the distribution of presynaptic boutons would predict that postsynaptic structures should follow suit. Indeed, work focusing on postsynaptic spines has shown that along the basal dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons, non-perforated spines, which represent the great majority of excitatory inputs, show a decrease in size (including PSD size) with dendritic distance (Menon et al., 2013Menon V.

However, it is unclear how the personhood of staff is construed within the care relationship. This paper aims to explore how the personhood of paid carers of people with dementia can be understood by focussing on the views and experiences of care home staff. We undertook a secondary qualitative analysis of interviews with 25 paid care staff in England, conducted as part of the MARQUE (Managing Agitation and Raising QUality of lifE) study. The authors inductively developed themes around the topic of personhood for staff, contrasting management and care staff perspectives. We found that many care staff are not identified as persons in their own right by their employing institutions, and that there is a general lack of acknowledgment of the moral work of caring that occurs within formal care work. This oversight can reduce the complex relationships of care work to a series of care tasks, challenges care workers' self-worth and self-efficacy, and impede their efforts to deliver person-centred care. We conclude that care staff status as persons in their own right should be explicitly considered in quality standards and supported by employers' policies and practices, not simply for their role in preserving the personhood of people with dementia but for their own sense of valued personhood. Enhancing staff personhood may also result in improved care."

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been demonstrated as key regulators of biotic and abiotic stress in plants, but the identification and prediction of cold responsive mRNAs and lncRNAs in wild banana remains unexplored. In present study, a cold resistant wild banana line from China was used to profile the cold-responsive mRNAs and lncRNAs by RNA-seq under cold stress conditions, i.e. 13°C (critical growth temperature), 4°C (chilling temperature), 0°C (freezing temperature) and normal growing condition, i.e. 28°C (control group). A total of 12,462 lncRNAs were identified in cold-stressed wild banana. In mRNA, much more alternative splicing events occurred in wild banana under the cold stress conditions compared with that in the normal growing condition. The GO analysis of differential expression genes (DEGs) showed the biochemical processes and membrane related genes responded positively to the cold stress. The KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of the DEGs showed that the pathways of photosynthesis, photosynthesis–antenna proteins, circadian rhythm–plant, glutathione metabolism, starch and sucrose metabolism, cutin/suberine/biosynthesis were altered or affected by the cold stress conditions. Our analyses of the generated transcriptome and lncRNAs provide new insights into regulating expression of genes and lncRNAs that respond to cold stress in the wild banana."
https://openalex.org/W2827411621,"The analysis of runs of homozygosity (ROH), using high throughput genomic data, has become a valuable and frequently used methodology to characterize the genomic and inbreeding variation of livestock and wildlife animal populations. However, this methodology has been scarcely used in highly inbred domestic animals. Here, we analyzed and characterized the occurrence of ROH fragments in highly inbred (HI; average pedigree-based inbreeding coefficient FPED = 0.164; 0.103 to 0.306) and outbred Retinta bulls (LI; average FPED = 0.008; 0 to 0.025). We studied the length of the fragments, their abundance, and genome distribution using high-density microarray data. The number of ROH was significantly higher in the HI group, especially for long fragments (>8Mb). In the LI group, the number of ROH continuously decreased with fragment length. Genome-wide distribution of ROH was highly variable between samples. Some chromosomes presented a larger number of fragments (BTA1, BTA19, BTA29), others had longer fragments (BTA4, BTA12, BTA17), while other ones showed an increased ROH accumulation over specific loci (BTA2, BTA7, BTA23, BTA29). Similar differences were observed in the analysis of 12 individuals produced by a similar inbred event (FPED3 = 0.125). The correlation between the fraction of the genome covered by ROH (FROH) and FPED was high (0.79), suggesting that ROH-based estimations are indicative of inbreeding levels. On the other hand, the correlation between FPED and the microsatellite-based inbreeding coefficient (FMIC) was only moderate (r = 0.44), suggesting that STR-based inbreeding estimations should be avoided. Similarly, we found a very low correlation (r = -0.0132) between recombination rate and ROH abundance across the genome. Finally, we performed functional annotation analyses of genome regions with significantly enriched ROH abundance. Results revealed gene clusters related to pregnancy-associated proteins and immune reaction. The same analysis performed for regions enriched with recently formed ROH (> 8 Mb) showed gene clusters related to flagellum assembly. In both cases, the processes were related to male and female reproductive functions, which may partially explain the reduced fertility associated with inbred populations."
https://openalex.org/W2856735097,"Although insects dominate the terrestrial fauna, sampling constraints and the poor taxonomic knowledge of many groups have limited assessments of their diversity. Passive sampling techniques and DNA-based species assignments now make it possible to overcome these barriers. For example, Malaise traps collect specimens with minimal intervention while the Barcode Index Number (BIN) system automates taxonomic assignments. The present study employs Malaise traps and DNA barcoding to extend understanding of insect diversity in one of the least known zoogeographic regions, the Saharo-Arabian. Insects were collected at four sites in three countries (Egypt, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia) by deploying Malaise traps. The collected specimens were analyzed by sequencing 658 bp of cytochrome oxidase I (DNA barcode) and assigning BINs on the Barcode of Life Data Systems. The year-long deployment of a Malaise trap in Pakistan and briefer placements at two Egyptian sites and at one in Saudi Arabia collected 53,092 specimens. They belonged to 17 insect orders with Diptera and Hymenoptera dominating the catch. Barcode sequences were recovered from 44,432 (84%) of the specimens, revealing the occurrence of 3,682 BINs belonging to 254 families. Many of these taxa were uncommon as 25% of the families and 50% of the BINs from Pakistan were only present in one sample. Family and BIN counts varied significantly through the year, but diversity indices did not. Although more than 10,000 specimens were analyzed from each nation, just 2% of BINs were shared by Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, 4% by Egypt and Pakistan, and 7% by Egypt and Saudi Arabia. The present study demonstrates how the BIN system can circumvent the barriers imposed by limited access to taxonomic specialists and by the fact that many insect species in the Saharo-Arabian region are undescribed."

This study evaluated the pattern of radiation-induced thyroid gland changes in 48 months after radiotherapy in NPC patients and the association of hypothyroidism incidence with thyroid dose.Fifty-six NPC patients treated by intensity modulated radiotherapy in 2013 were recruited. All patients received baseline thyroid hormones (fT3, fT4 and TSH) tests and CT scan before radiotherapy. Repeated measures of the thyroid hormones and gland volume were performed at 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36 and 48 months after treatment. Trend lines of the thyroid volume and hormone level changes against time were plotted. The incidence of hypothyroidism patients and its relationship with the dose were also evaluated.The mean thyroid volume followed a decreasing trend after radiotherapy, reaching a minimum (-39.8%) at 30 months and slightly increased afterward. The fT4 level followed a similar pattern with its mean value dropped by 21.5% at 30 months and became steady after 36 months. TSH level showed gradual rise from just after radiotherapy, reaching a peak at 24 months and became relatively steady after 36 months. The incidence of hypothyroidism increased to a maximum at 24 months (28.6%) and dropped afterwards. Thyroid Dmean and D50 were significantly correlated with hypothyroidism incidence in 12 to 30 months (ρ > 0.40, p < 0.05).The patterns of radiation induced thyroid volume shrinkage and fT4 level reduction were similar, with both of them showed decreasing trend from 0 to 30 months. The thyroid volume and function reached a relatively steady state after 36 months. The incidence of hypothyroidism increased up to 24 months and its frequency was associated with the thyroid dose."
https://openalex.org/W2857001917,"Aquatic caddisfly larvae (caddisworms) wet-spin fibers to construct composite cases of silk and stone. The silk emerges from labial ducts as a nanofibrous fluid gel, flowing over the stone substrate and making intimate interfacial adhesive contacts before being drawn into tough fibers that rapidly solidify underwater to span gaps in the construction. Divalent metal ions are responsible for the unique mechanical properties of naturally spun silk fibers; however, when and where divalent metal ions are incorporated into the metallofibers and other aspects of the fiber solidification mechanism are poorly understood. To investigate, the elemental composition and secondary structure of silk precursors stored in the silk gland lumen were compared with naturally spun fibers by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy and attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Naturally spun fibers contained near equimolar ratios of Ca2+ to P. In contrast, silk precursors stored in the silk gland lumen contained only traces of Ca2+ and other multivalent metal ions. Ca2+ was also undetectable in anterior lumenal silk using the histochemical Ca2+ indicator, alizarin S red. Addition of Ca2+ to isolated lumenal silk resulted in Ca2+ complexation by H-fibroin phosphoserines (pSs) and a shift in secondary structure from random coils to β-structures, creating infrared spectra in the phosphate and amide I regions nearly equivalent to those found in naturally spun Ca2+-containing silk fibers. Light and electron microscopy within distinct regions of the silk gland suggested that posterior gland silk colloidal complexes transition into a nanofibrous morphology as they pass into the chitin-lined anterior lumen. Altogether, the results suggest that environmental Ca2+ absorbed from natural water triggers silk fiber solidification postdraw by complexing H-fibroin pSs, creating Ca2+-stabilized crystalline β-nanodomains that cross-link and toughen the freshly drawn silk fibers.-Ashton, N. N., Stewart, R. J. Aquatic caddisworm silk is solidified by environmental metal ions during the natural fiber-spinning process."

https://openalex.org/W2813789523,"Background The aims of this study were to investigate glaucomatous morphological changes quantitatively in the visual cortex of the brain with voxel-based morphometry (VBM), a normalizing MRI technique, and to clarify the relationship between glaucomatous damage and regional changes in the visual cortex of patients with open-angle glaucoma (OAG). Methods Thirty-one patients with OAG (age: 55.9 ± 10.7, male: female = 9: 22) and 20 age-matched controls (age: 54.9 ± 9.8, male: female = 10: 10) were included in this study. The cross-sectional area (CSA) of the optic nerve was manually measured with T2-weighed MRI. Images of the visual cortex were acquired with T1-weighed 3D magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition with gradient echo (MPRAGE) sequencing, and the normalized regional visual cortex volume, i.e., gray matter density (GMD), in Brodmann areas (BA) 17, 18, and 19, was calculated with a normalizing technique based on statistic parametric mapping 8 (SPM8) analysis. We compared the regional GMD of the visual cortex in the control subjects and OAG patients. Spearman’s rank correlation analysis was used to determine the relationship between optic nerve CSA and GMD in BA 17, 18, and 19. Results We found that the normal and OAG patients differed significantly in optic nerve CSA (p < 0.001) and visual cortex GMD in BA 17 (p = 0.030), BA 18 (p = 0.003), and BA 19 (p = 0.005). In addition, we found a significant correlation between optic nerve CSA and visual cortex GMD in BA 19 (r = 0.33, p = 0.023), but not in BA 17 (r = 0.17, p = 0.237) or BA 18 (r = 0.24, p = 0.099). Conclusion Quantitative MRI parametric evaluation of GMD can detect glaucoma-associated anatomical atrophy of the visual cortex in BA 17, 18, and 19. Furthermore, GMD in BA 19 was significantly correlated to the damage level of the optic nerve, as well as the retina, in patients with OAG. This is the first demonstration of an association between the cortex of the brain responsible for higher-order visual function and glaucoma severity. Evaluation of the visual cortex with MRI is thus a very promising potential method for objective examination in OAG."
https://openalex.org/W2849168948,"Chloris truncata is a significant weed in summer crops in the subtropical region of Australia. A study was conducted to evaluate the effect of environmental factors on germination and emergence of two populations of C. truncata. Overall, germination was not affected by the populations. Seeds germinated at a wide range of alternating day/night temperatures, suggesting that seeds can germinate throughout the spring, winter and autumn seasons. Seed germination was stimulated by the presence of light; however, 51 to 71% of these seeds still germinated in the dark. The sodium chloride concentration and osmotic potential required to inhibit germination of 50% of the population were 179 mM and -0.52 MPa, respectively. A high proportion of seeds germinated over a wide pH range (4 to 10). Seeds placed on the soil surface had greatest germination (67%) and a burial depth of 3 cm resulted in complete inhibition of emergence. The sorghum residue amount required to reduce emergence by 50% was 1.8 t ha-1. The results suggest that, although this weed will be favored in no-till systems, residue retention on the soil surface will help in reducing its infestation. Seed bank buildup can be managed by burying seeds below the depth of emergence."
https://openalex.org/W2865387857,"The diagnosis of strongyloidiasis by coprological methods has a low sensitivity, underestimating the prevalence of Strongyloides stercoralis in endemic areas. Serodiagnostic tests for strongyloidiasis have shown robust diagnostic properties. However, these methods require a blood draw, an invasive and labor-intensive sample collection method, especially in the resource-limited settings where S. stercoralis is endemic. Our study examines a urine-based assay for strongyloidiasis and compares its diagnostic accuracy with coprological and serological methods. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses determined the diagnostic sensitivity (D-Sn) and specificity (D-Sp) of the urine ELISA, as well as estimates its positive predictive value and diagnostic risk. The likelihood ratios of obtaining a positive test result (LR+) or a negative test result (LR-) were calculated for each diagnostic positivity threshold. The urine ELISA assay correlated significantly with the serological ELISA assay for strongyloidiasis, with a D-Sn of 92.7% and a D-Sp of 40.7%, when compared to coprological methods. Moreover, the urine ELISA IgG test had a detection rate of 69%, which far exceeds the coprological method (28%). The likelihood of a positive diagnosis of strongyloidiasis by the urine ELISA IgG test increased significantly with increasing units of IgG detected in urine. The urine ELISA IgG assay for strongyloidiasis assay has a diagnostic accuracy comparable to serological assay, both of which are more sensitive than coprological methods. Since the collection of urine is easy and non-invasive, the urine ELISA IgG assay for strongyloidiasis could be used to screen populations at risk for strongyloidiasis in S. stercoralis endemic areas."
https://openalex.org/W2830003600,"Although the medical treatments of sarcoma have evolved in the last years, a significant portion of patients develops recurrence after therapies suggesting the need to identify novel targets to improve the treatments. By the use of patient-derived and established cell lines from liposarcoma, as well as specimens from patient biopsies, we found that HMGA1 is involved in the progression of dedifferentiated and myxoid liposarcoma. The immunohistochemical and RT-PCR analyses of 68 liposarcoma specimens revealed a significant high expression of HMGA1, at the protein and RNA levels, both in myxoid and dedifferentiated liposarcoma subtypes compared with differentiated ones. Loss- and gain-of-function experiments by HMGA1-specific depletion and overexpression in dedifferentiated and myxoid liposarcoma cells showed the contribution of this oncogenic factor in cell proliferation, motility, invasion, and drug resistance. The in vitro and in vivo treatment of myxoid liposarcoma with trabectedin, a drug with a potent anti-tumor activity, revealed downregulation of HMGA1, E2F1, and its-downstream targets, vimentin and ZEB1, indicating a critical role of trabectedin in inhibiting the mesenchymal markers of these tumors through the HMGA1/E2F1 axis. These data were also confirmed in patients’ tumor biopsies being HMGA1, E2F1, and vimentin expression significantly reduced upon trabectedin therapy, administered as neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. Furthermore, trabectedin treatment inhibits in vitro NFkB pathway in mixoyd liposarcoma sensitive but not in resistant counterparts, and the inhibition of NFkB pathway re-sensitizes the resistant cells to trabectedin treatment. These data support the rational for combining NFkB inhibitors with trabectedin in liposarcoma patients, who have become resistant to the drug."
https://openalex.org/W2868038526,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients often take non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and corticosteroids as supportive drugs. In this study, we investigated the prevalence of endoscopic gastric damage and their prescribed medications under an actual clinical condition.We collected the data of 1704 RA patients who underwent upper gastrointestinal fiberscopy. Gastric mucosal erosion and ulcer were classified using modified LANZA score. We analyzed these data with a multiple regression analysis.The prevalence of endoscopic gastric mucosal damage in these RA patients was 16.7% (285 cases). A multiple regression analysis indicated that prednisolone (PSL), NSAIDs and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) were independent risk factors associated with the modified LANZA score. PSL and NSAIDs were positively correlated with the score, while the administration of PPIs was inversely correlated with the score. The modified LANZA score in RA patients treated with both PSL and NSAIDs was significantly higher than that in those treated with PSL alone (no NSAIDs use).Our findings suggest that PSL and NSAIDs were exacerbating factors for gastric mucosal damage, while PPIs usage was a protective factor. And, the combined usage of corticosteroids and NSAIDs may induce the development of gastric ulcers."
https://openalex.org/W2843516402,"The incidence and prevalence of diabetes is increasing worldwide and it is the fifth leading cause of mortality accounting for over 3.8 million deaths annually. Despite the enormity of the diabetes-related health burdens, very few studies have evaluated the factors associated with mortality among people with diabetes in India. We sought to study the causes and predictors of mortality among urban Asian Indians with and without diabetes.Of 2273 adults (27,850 person-years of follow-up) from the 10-year follow-up of the Chennai Urban Rural Epidemiology Study (CURES), the cause of death could be ascertained in 552 individuals out of the 671 who had died (response rate 82.3%). Verbal autopsy was obtained from the family members of the deceased and this was adjudicated by trained physicians. The age-standardized mortality rate was 28.2 (95%CI 25.9-30.6) per 100,000 population. Mortality rates were significantly higher in individuals with diabetes compared to those without [27.9(95% CI 25.5-30.6) vs. 8.0 (6.6-9.9) per 1000 person years]. Compared to individuals of normal body mass index, underweight individuals had higher risk of mortality (Hazard ratio 1.49; 95% CI 1.11-2.0), whereas overweight and obese individuals did not show a higher risk. The population-attributable risk for all-cause mortality in the entire study cohort was highest for ischemic heart disease and diabetes. The excess mortality attributable to diabetes was highest in the age group of 51 to 70 years, and was mostly accounted for by renal disease (Rate ratio 5.68, 95%CI 2.43-6.23), ischemic heart disease (4.23,2.78-6.67), and cerebrovascular disease (4.00,1.87-9.81).Underweight (but not overweight or obesity) was strongly associated with mortality in this Asian Indian population. Ischemic heart disease and diabetes contributed the most to risk for all cause mortality. Excess mortality due to diabetes was higher in relatively younger individuals and was mostly accounted for by renal disease."
https://openalex.org/W2868724582,"We previously have identified the ectopic expression of Rac1b, an activated and novel splice variant of Rac1, in a subset of human colorectal adenocarcinomas, as well as in inflammatory bowel diseases and in colitis mouse model. Rac1b overexpression has been further evidenced in breast, pancreatic, thyroid, ovarian, and lung cancers. In this context, the aim of our study was to investigate the physiopathological implications of Rac1b in intestinal inflammation and carcinogenesis in vivo. The ectopic expression of Rac1b was induced in mouse intestinal epithelial cells after crossing Rosa26-LSL-Rac1b and villin-Cre mice. These animals were let to age or were challenged with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) to induce experimental colitis, or either received azoxymethane (AOM)/DSS treatment, or were bred with ApcMin/+ or Il10−/− mice to trigger intestinal tumors. Rac1b ectopic expression increased the intestinal epithelial cell proliferation and migration, enhanced the production of reactive oxygen species, and promoted the Paneth cell lineage. Although Rac1b overexpression alone was not sufficient to drive intestinal neoplasia, it enhanced Apc-dependent intestinal tumorigenesis. In the context of Il10 knockout, the Rac1b transgene strengthened colonic inflammation due to induced intestinal mucosa permeability and promoted cecum and proximal colon carcinogenesis. In contrast, Rac1b alleviated carcinogen/acute inflammation-associated colon carcinogenesis (AOM/DSS). This resulted at least partly from the early mucosal repair after resolution of inflammation. Our data highlight the critical role of Rac1b in driving wound-healing after resolution of intestinal inflammation, and in cooperating with Wnt pathway dysregulation and chronic inflammation to promote intestinal carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2811906518,"The prevalence of cardiovascular diseases is increasing in low and middle-income countries; Nepal's population shows a high prevalence of behavioral risk factors. Our cross-sectional study in the Jhaukhel-Duwakot Health Demographic Surveillance Site (JD-HDSS), located near the capital Kathmandu, explored knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) of mothers with young children regarding diet and physical activity and mothers' perception of their children's attitude and behavior toward the same issues. The purpose of our study was to assess needs of the mothers concerning cardiovascular health in general and more specifically regarding diet and physical activity, and to establish a baseline for future intervention in the community by comparing two villages of JD-HDSS. In August-November 2014, nine trained enumerators interviewed all mothers of children aged 1-7 years (N = 962). We scored responses on dietary and physical activity KAP, then categorized the scores based on the percentage obtained out of the maximum possible scores into ""poor,"" ""fair,"" and ""good."" More highly educated mothers scored higher for KAP (all p<0.001); the children's behavior score reflected their mother's education level (p = 0.007). Most respondents were unfamiliar with the concept of healthy and unhealthy food. Overall, 57% of respondents in JD-HDSS had ""good"" knowledge, 44.6% had ""good"" attitude, and most (90%) had ""poor"" practice. We observed no significant differences between the villages regarding mothers' knowledge and attitude or children's behavior. Practice score of mothers in Jhaukhel was higher than those in Duwakot regarding diet and physical activity (p<0.001). Mothers' perceived barriers for improving lifestyle were high cost of healthy food, taste preference of other family members, and lack of knowledge regarding healthy food. Barriers for physical activity were lack of leisure time, absence of parks and playgrounds, busy caring for children and old people, feeling lazy, and embarrassed to be physically active in front of others. Our findings suggest that a health education intervention promoting a healthy lifestyle for mothers and children might improve KAP and also improve cardiovascular health. To address mothers' gap between knowledge and practice, a future intervention should consider perceived barriers."

The myodural bridge has been considered to have a significant role in physiological functions. However, there is little information about the myodural bridge in marine mammals; we conducted this study to investigate and examine the morphology of the myodural bridge in a sperm whale. We also aim to discuss the physiological functions of the myodural bridge. In this study, a 15.1-meter long sperm whale carcass was examined. Multiple methods were conducted to examine the bridges of the sperm whale which included dissection, P45 plastination and histological analysis. This study confirmed the existence of the myodural bridge in the sperm whale and shows there are two types of the bridge in the sperm whale: one type was the occipital-dural bridge (ODB), the other type was the MDB. A large venous plexus was found within the epidural space and this venous plexus is thought to contain a great amount of blood when in deep water and thus the movements of suboccipital muscles could be a unique power source that drives cerebrospinal fluid circulation."

The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between fat mass and the musculoskeletal pain prospectively in Korean community residents. In the Korean Health and Genome Study, participants (mean age 60.2 years, 56.2% women) completed pain questionnaires and underwent dual x-ray absorptiometry to calculate body composition. Three-year follow-up data on pain was available for 1,325 participants. Pain was categorized according to number of pain regions. At three years of follow-up, participants were classified as follows: 1) no pain both at baseline and at three years (no pain), 2) any pain (one, two or more, or widespread regions) at baseline and no pain at three years (transient pain), 3) no pain at baseline and any pain at three years (new pain) 4) any pain both at baseline and at 3 years (persistent pain). 1) and 2) were grouped as no/transient pain group (no pain) and 3) and 4) as new/persistent pain group (pain). Female gender and obesity were two significant factors associated with the persistence or development of pain. Total fat mass and fat:muscle mass ratio were associated with pain among female participants only, and the odds ratios for pain were significantly increased in female participants in the highest quartile of total fat mass and fat muscle ratio after adjustment. In conclusion, both female gender and obesity were two significant factors associated with pain. Fat mass parameters and pain were significantly associated only among females."
https://openalex.org/W2831768535,"Polycomb Group (PcG) genes are transcriptional repressors that are described to be important during development and differentiation. There is significant interest in PcGs proteins because of their role in stem cell biology and tumorigenesis. In this study we characterize the expression of a selection of PcG genes in the adult germline of zebrafish and during embryogenesis. In adults, expression of selected PcG genes is found to be enriched in germ line over somatic tissues. Therefore, the germ line of adult zebrafish was analyzed for the expression pattern of a selection of PcG genes by whole mount in situ hybridization. We detected presence of the tested PcG gene transcripts at early stages of both oogenesis and spermatogenesis. This enriched expression for early stages of gametogenesis is also observed in developing gonads at 4 and 5 weeks post fertilization. Additionally, zebrafish embryos were used to study the spatio-temporal expression patterns of a selection of PcG genes during development. The PcG genes that we tested are maternally loaded and ubiquitously expressed at early developmental stages, except of ezh1. The expression of the PcG genes that were assessed becomes enriched anteriorly and is more defined during tissue specification. The data shown here is an important resource for functional PcG gene studies in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2851430586,"Background Children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) often suffer from toxicity of chemotherapeutic drugs such as Methotrexate (MTX). Previously, we reported that 20% of patients receiving high-dose MTX developed oral mucositis. MTX inhibits folate metabolism, which is essential for DNA methylation. We hypothesize that MTX inhibits DNA methylation, which results into adverse effects. We studied DNA methylation markers during high-dose methotrexate treatment in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in relation to developing oral mucositis. Materials & methods S-Adenosyl-Methionine (SAM) and S-Adenosyl-Homocysteine (SAH) levels and LINE1 DNA methylation were measured prospectively before and after high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX 4 x 5g/m2) therapy in 82 children with ALL. Methotrexate-induced oral mucositis was registered prospectively. Oral mucositis (grade ≥ 3 National Cancer Institute Criteria) was used as clinical endpoint. Results SAM levels decreased significantly during methotrexate therapy (-16.1 nmol/L (-144.0 –+46.0), p<0.001), while SAH levels and the SAM:SAH ratio did not change significantly. LINE1 DNA methylation (+1.4% (-1.1 –+6.5), p<0.001) increased during therapy. SAM and SAH levels were not correlated to LINE1 DNA methylation status. No association was found between DNA methylation markers and developing oral mucositis. Conclusions This was the first study that assessed DNA methylation in relation to MTX-induced oral mucositis in children with ALL. Although global methylation markers did change during methotrexate therapy, methylation status was not associated with developing oral mucositis."
https://openalex.org/W2860074735,"This research assesses the evolution of lexical diversity in scholarly titles using a new indicator based on zipfian frequency-rank distribution tail fits. At the operational level, while both head and tail fits of zipfian word distributions are more independent of corpus size than other lexical diversity indicators, the latter however neatly outperforms the former in that regard. This benchmark-setting performance of zipfian distribution tails proves extremely handy in distinguishing actual patterns in lexical diversity from the statistical noise generated by other indicators due to corpus size fluctuations. From an empirical perspective, analysis of Web of Science (WoS) article titles from 1975 to 2014 shows that the lexical concentration of scholarly titles in Natural Sciences & Engineering (NSE) and Social Sciences & Humanities (SSH) articles increases by a little less than 8% over the whole period. With the exception of the lexically concentrated Mathematics, Earth & Space, and Physics, NSE article titles all increased in lexical concentration, suggesting a probable convergence of concentration levels in the near future. As regards to SSH disciplines, aggregation effects observed at the disciplinary group level suggests that, behind the stable concentration levels of SSH disciplines, a cross-disciplinary homogenization of the highest word frequency ranks may be at work. Overall, these trends suggest a progressive standardization of title wording in scientific article titles, as article titles get written using an increasingly restricted and cross-disciplinary set of words."

Transforming growth factor-β1(TGF-β1)and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) -related biomarkers were detected by eliseand western blot. The migration and invasion ability of A549 cells and NCI-H1299 were examined by scratch-wound assay and transwell assay respectively. We found compare with control group, the expression of TGF-β and mesenchymal markers in CTEN overexpression group were increased, and the epithelial marker was decreased, which induced the EMT process. Meanwhile, scratch-woundassay showed that the migration efficiency of A549 and NCI-H1299 cells in CTEN overexpression group were higher than that in control group.Transwell assay demonstrated that the number of cells that migrated and invaded through the membrane were obviously more than those in control group.Furthermore, Knockdown of CTEN partially reversed transforming growth factor-β1(TGF-β1)-induced changes in EMT markers. In conclusion, CTEN activated the expression of TGF-β1, thereby prompting EMT in lung adenocareinma cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2859230022,"Carotenoids in citrus fruits have health benefits and make the fruits visually attractive. Red-fleshed ‘Chuhong’ (‘CH’) and pale green-fleshed ‘Feicui’ (‘FC’) pummelo (Citrus maxima (Burm) Merr.) fruits are interesting materials for studying the mechanisms of carotenoid accumulation. In this study, particularly high contents of linear carotenes were observed in the albedo tissue, segment membranes and juice sacs of ‘CH’. However, carotenoids, especially β-carotene and xanthophylls, accumulated more in the flavedo tissue of ‘FC’ than in that of ‘CH’. Additionally, the contents of other terpenoids such as limonin, nomilin and abscisic acid significantly differed in the juice sacs at 150 days postanthesis. A dramatic increase in carotenoid production was observed at 45 to 75 days postanthesis in the segment membranes and juice sacs of ‘CH’. Different expression levels of carotenogenesis genes, especially the ζ-carotene desaturase (CmZDS), β-carotenoid hydroxylase (CmBCH) and zeaxanthin epoxidase (CmZEP) genes, in combination are directly responsible for the largely different carotenoid profiles between these two pummelo fruits. The sequences of eleven genes involved in carotenoid synthesis were investigated; different alleles of seven of eleven genes might also explain the largely different carotenogenesis observed between ‘CH’ and ‘FC’. These results enhance our understanding of carotenogenesis in pummelo fruits."
https://openalex.org/W2872967924,"Ferrochelatase (FECH) is an enzyme necessary for heme synthesis, which is essential for maintaining normal functions of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC). We tested the hypothesis that inhibition of vascular FECH to attenuate heme synthesis downregulates eNOS and sGC expression, resulting in impaired NO/cGMP-dependent relaxation. To this end, isolated bovine coronary arteries (BCAs) were in vitro incubated without (as controls) or with N-methyl protoporphyrin (NMPP; 10−5–10-7M; a selective FECH antagonist) for 24 and 72 hours respectively. Tissue FECH activity, heme, nitrite/NO and superoxide levels were sequentially measured. Protein expression of FECH, eNOS and sGC was detected by western blot analysis. Vascular responses to various vasoactive agents were evaluated via isometric tension studies. Treatment of BCAs with NMPP initiated a time- and dose-dependent attenuation of FECH activity without changes in its protein expression, followed by significant reduction in the heme level. Moreover, ACh-induced relaxation and ACh-stimulated release of NO were significant reduced, associated with suppression of eNOS protein expression in NMPP-treated groups. Decreased relaxation to NO donor spermine-NONOate reached the statistical significance in BCAs incubated with NMPP for 72 hours, concomitantly with downregulation of sGCβ1 expression that was independent of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), nor did it significantly affect BCA relaxation caused by BAY 58–2667 that activates sGC in the heme-deficiency. Neither vascular responses to non-NO/sGC-mediators nor production of superoxide was affected by NMPP-treatment. In conclusion, deletion of vascular heme production via inhibiting FECH elicits downregulation of eNOS and sGC expression, leading to an impaired NO-mediated relaxation in an oxidative stress-independent manner."

Methods The scoring method was developed by integrating results from in-depth discussions with experts, consensus meetings, multiple reading experiments and the literature. Cortical interruptions were scored by two independent readers in an imaging dataset with finger joints from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and healthy controls and assessed for adjacent trabecular distortion. Reliability for the total number of cortical interruptions per joint and per quadrant was calculated using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Feasibility was tested by recording the time to analyze one joint. Results In 98 joints we identified 252 cortical interruptions, 17% had trabecular distortion. Mean diameter of the interruptions was significantly larger in patients with RA compared with healthy controls (0.88 vs 0.47 mm, p = 0.03). Intra-reader reliability was ICC 0.88 (95% CI 0.83;0.92) per joint and ICC 0.69 (95% CI 0.65;0.73) per quadrant. Inter-reader reliability was ICC 0.48 (95% CI 0.20;0.67) per joint and ICC 0.56 (95% CI 0.49;0.62) per quadrant. The time to score one joint was mean 9.2 (SD 4.9) min. Conclusions This scoring method allows detection of small cortical interruptions on HR-pQCT imaging of finger joints, which is promising for use in clinical studies."
https://openalex.org/W2850587156,"Background A blood-based assay that could quantify HIV susceptibility would be very valuable for HIV prevention research. Previously, we developed and validated an ex vivo, flow-based, HIV entry assay to assess genital HIV susceptibility in endocervical CD4+ T cells. Methods Here we assessed whether this tool could be used to predict HIV risk using blood-derived CD4+ T cells in a rigorously-blinded, nested case-control study using blood samples collected from high-risk, HIV-uninfected South African women enrolled in the CAPRISA 004 clinical trial. Cases, subsequently acquiring HIV were sampled prior to HIV infection and compared with controls, who remained HIV-uninfected. The primary endpoint was ex vivo entry of a CCR5-tropic HIV founder virus into blood CD4+ T cells. Secondary endpoints included HIV entry into CD4+ central (TCM) and effector (TEM) memory T cells, and into CD4+ T cell subsets expressing CCR5, CD69, CCR6, α4β1 or α4β7. Results Compared to bulk CD4+ T cells (4.9% virus entry), CD4+ T cells expressing CCR5, CCR6 or α4β1 and TEM were highly susceptible (15.5%, 8.8%, 8.2% and 10.8% entry, respectively, all p<0.0001), while TCM, CD69+ or α4β7+ CD4+ cells were moderately susceptible (6.4%, 6.0% and 5.8% respectively, p ≤ 0.003). While the proportion of the aforementioned highly susceptible cells correlated with overall virus entry into CD4+ T cells within an individual (r = 0.68, 0.47, 0.67, and 0.60 respectively, p<0.0001), blood virus entry did not predict subsequent mucosal HIV acquisition after controlling for sexual behaviour and condom use (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.77–1.11, p = 0.40). Conclusions Although virus entry identified several previously known highly susceptible cellular HIV targets, blood HIV entry did not predict subsequent heterosexual HIV acquisition. Assessment of mucosal HIV susceptibility may require sampling at the site of HIV exposure."
https://openalex.org/W2865438576,"The present study compared standard computed tomography (CT) and histopathological findings after endovascular embolization using a prototype of inherently radiopaque 40μm-microspheres with both standard 40μm-microspheres and iodized oil in a porcine liver model.Twelve pigs were divided into six study groups, of two pigs each. Four pigs were embolized with iodized oil alone and four with radiopaque microspheres; two animals in each group were sacrificed at 2 hours and two at 7 days. Two pigs were embolized with radiopaque microspheres and heparin and sacrificed at 7 days. Two pigs were embolized with standard microspheres and sacrificed at 2 hours. CT was performed before and after segmental embolization and before sacrifice at 7 days. The distribution of embolic agent, inflammatory response and tissue necrosis were assessed histopathologically.Radiopaque microspheres and iodized oil were visible on standard CT 2 hours and 7 days after embolization, showing qualitatively comparable arterial and parenchymal enhancement. Quantitatively, the enhancement was more intense for iodized oil. Standard microspheres, delivered without contrast, were not visible by imaging. Radiopaque and standard microspheres similarly occluded subsegmental and interlobular arteries and, to a lesser extent, sinusoids. Iodized oil resulted in the deepest penetration into sinusoids. Necrosis was always observed after embolization with microspheres, but never after embolization with iodized oil. The inflammatory response was mild to moderate for microspheres and moderate to severe for iodized oil.Radiopaque 40μm-microspheres are visible on standard CT with qualitatively similar but quantitatively less intense enhancement compared to iodized oil, and with a tendency towards less of an inflammatory reaction than iodized oil. These microspheres also result in tissue necrosis, which was not observed after embolization with iodized oil. Both radiopaque and standard 40μm-microspheres are found within subsegmental and interlobar arteries, as well as in hepatic sinusoids."
https://openalex.org/W2732602331,"We study the distribution of strategies in a large game that models how agents choose among different double auction markets. We classify the possible mean field Nash equilibria, which include potentially segregated states where an agent population can split into subpopulations adopting different strategies. As the game is aggregative, the actual equilibrium strategy distributions remain undetermined, however. We therefore compare with the results of Experience-Weighted Attraction (EWA) learning, which at long times leads to Nash equilibria in the appropriate limits of large intensity of choice, low noise (long agent memory) and perfect imputation of missing scores (fictitious play). The learning dynamics breaks the indeterminacy of the Nash equilibria. Non-trivially, depending on how the relevant limits are taken, more than one type of equilibrium can be selected. These include the standard homogeneous mixed and heterogeneous pure states, but also \emph{heterogeneous mixed} states where different agents play different strategies that are not all pure. The analysis of the EWA learning involves Fokker-Planck modeling combined with large deviation methods. The theoretical results are confirmed by multi-agent simulations."
https://openalex.org/W2881488772,"Patient registry data are commonly collected as annual snapshots that need to be amalgamated to understand the longitudinal progress of each patient. However, patient identifiers can either change or may not be available for legal reasons when longitudinal data are collated from patients living in different countries. Here, we apply astronomical statistical matching techniques to link individual patient records that can be used where identifiers are absent or to validate uncertain identifiers. We adopt a Bayesian model framework used for probabilistically linking records in astronomy. We adapt this and validate it across blinded, annually collected data. This is a high-quality (Danish) sub-set of data held in the European Cystic Fibrosis Society Patient Registry (ECFSPR). Our initial experiments achieved a precision of 0.990 at a recall value of 0.987. However, detailed investigation of the discrepancies uncovered typing errors in 27 of the identifiers in the original Danish sub-set. After fixing these errors to create a new gold standard our algorithm correctly linked individual records across years achieving a precision of 0.997 at a recall value of 0.987 without recourse to identifiers. Our Bayesian framework provides the probability of whether a pair of records belong to the same patient. Unlike other record linkage approaches, our algorithm can also use physical models, such as body mass index curves, as prior information for record linkage. We have shown our framework can create longitudinal samples where none existed and validate pre-existing patient identifiers. We have demonstrated that in this specific case this automated approach is better than the existing identifiers."
https://openalex.org/W2848050257,"PCA has been widely used in many fields to detect dominant principle components, but it ignores the information embedded in the remaining components. As a supplement to PCA, we propose the General Component Analysis (GCA). The inverse participation ratios (IPRs) are used to identify the global components (GCs) and localized components (LCs). The mean values of the IPRs derived from the shuffled data are taken as the natural threshold, which is exquisite and novel. In this paper, the Chinese corporate bond market is analyzed as an example. We propose a novel network method to divide time periods based on micro data, which performs better in capturing the time points when the market state switches. As a result, two periods have been obtained. There are two GCs in both periods, which are influenced by terms to maturity and ratings. Besides, there are 382 LCs in Period 1 and 166 LCs in Period 2. In the LC portfolios there are two interesting bond collections which are helpful to understand the thoughts of the investors. One is the supper AAA bond collection which is believed to have implicit governmental guarantees by the investors, and the other is the overcapacity industrial bond collection which is influenced by the supply-side reform led by the Chinese government. GCA is expected to be applied to other complex systems."
