https://openalex.org/W1981916955,"Cholesterol-mediated lipid interactions, such as nanodomain formation, are considered vital in a cell, but because of the lack of suitable detection techniques, their spatiotemporal range remained highly controversial. Here, Eggeling et al. use subdiffraction-resolution STED (stimulated emission depletion) fluorescence microscopy to detect the diffusion of single lipids or glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins on the plasma membrane of a living cell. Tuning the probing spot area up to about 70-fold below that of a confocal microscope reveals that unlike phosphoglycerolipids, sphingolipids and GPI-anchored proteins are trapped for about 10 ms in cholesterol-mediated complexes within less than 20 nm space. Optical probing in nanosized areas is a powerful new approach to study biomolecular function. Here, subdiffraction-resolution STED fluorescence microscopy is used to detect the diffusion of single lipids or GPI-anchored proteins on the plasma membrane of a living cell. Tuning the probing spot area ∼70-fold below that of a confocal microscope reveals that unlike phosphoglycerolipids, sphingolipids and GPI-anchored proteins are trapped for ∼10 ms in cholesterol-mediated complexes within <20 nm space. Cholesterol-mediated lipid interactions are thought to have a functional role in many membrane-associated processes such as signalling events1,2,3,4,5. Although several experiments indicate their existence, lipid nanodomains (‘rafts’) remain controversial owing to the lack of suitable detection techniques in living cells4,6,7,8,9. The controversy is reflected in their putative size of 5–200 nm, spanning the range between the extent of a protein complex and the resolution limit of optical microscopy. Here we demonstrate the ability of stimulated emission depletion (STED) far-field fluorescence nanoscopy10 to detect single diffusing (lipid) molecules in nanosized areas in the plasma membrane of living cells. Tuning of the probed area to spot sizes ∼70-fold below the diffraction barrier reveals that unlike phosphoglycerolipids, sphingolipids and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins are transiently (∼10–20 ms) trapped in cholesterol-mediated molecular complexes dwelling within <20-nm diameter areas. The non-invasive optical recording of molecular time traces and fluctuation data in tunable nanoscale domains is a powerful new approach to study the dynamics of biomolecules in living cells."
https://openalex.org/W2145492799,"Spinal muscular atrophy is one of the most common inherited forms of neurological disease leading to infant mortality. Patients have selective loss of lower motor neurons resulting in muscle weakness, paralysis and often death. Although patient fibroblasts have been used extensively to study spinal muscular atrophy, motor neurons have a unique anatomy and physiology which may underlie their vulnerability to the disease process. Here we report the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells from skin fibroblast samples taken from a child with spinal muscular atrophy. These cells expanded robustly in culture, maintained the disease genotype and generated motor neurons that showed selective deficits compared to those derived from the child’s unaffected mother. This is the first study to show that human induced pluripotent stem cells can be used to model the specific pathology seen in a genetically inherited disease. As such, it represents a promising resource to study disease mechanisms, screen new drug compounds and develop new therapies. The inherited disease spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), one of the most common neurological disorders causing death in childhood, is caused by mutations in both copies of the SMN1 gene. Little is known about SMA pathogenesis, partly because it is unique to humans who have two versions of this gene — SMN1 and SMN2; rodents and other lab model candidates have just one. Now a new technique has been developed that creates a tool for studying SMA disease pathology at the cellular level. Skin fibroblasts from a child with SMA (and for comparison from his unaffected mother) were used to generate induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell lines. They form neural progenitor cultures that can produce differentiated neural tissue and motor neurons that maintain the disease phenotype. The cultures also responded to drugs known to elevate the mutated protein associated with the disease. Similar iPS technology may be of value in the study of other genetic disorders such as Huntington's disease. This paper generates an iPS cell line from patients with spinal muscular atrophy, an autosomal recessive genetic disorder that is one of the most common inherited forms of neurological disease in children."
https://openalex.org/W2166739815,"Delivery of genes to the brain and spinal cord across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) has not yet been achieved. Here we show that adeno-associated virus (AAV) 9 injected intravenously bypasses the BBB and efficiently targets cells of the central nervous system (CNS). Injection of AAV9-GFP into neonatal mice through the facial vein results in extensive transduction of dorsal root ganglia and motor neurons throughout the spinal cord and widespread transduction of neurons throughout the brain, including the neocortex, hippocampus and cerebellum. In adult mice, tail vein injection of AAV9-GFP leads to robust transduction of astrocytes throughout the entire CNS, with limited neuronal transduction. This approach may enable the development of gene therapies for a range of neurodegenerative diseases, such as spinal muscular atrophy, through targeting of motor neurons, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, through targeting of astrocytes. It may also be useful for rapid postnatal genetic manipulations in basic neuroscience studies."

https://openalex.org/W2122621644,"Alexandra-Chloé Villani and colleagues have identified SNPs located on chromosome 1q44 downstream of the NLRP3 gene that are associated with increased risk of Crohn's disease. We used a candidate gene approach to identify a set of SNPs, located in a predicted regulatory region on chromosome 1q44 downstream of NLRP3 (previously known as CIAS1 and NALP3) that are associated with Crohn's disease. The associations were consistently replicated in four sample sets from individuals of European descent. In the combined analysis of all samples (710 father-mother-child trios, 239 cases and 107 controls), these SNPs were strongly associated with risk of Crohn's disease (Pcombined = 3.49 × 10−9, odds ratio = 1.78, confidence interval = 1.47–2.16 for rs10733113), reaching a level consistent with the stringent significance thresholds imposed by whole-genome association studies. In addition, we observed significant associations between SNPs in the associated regions and NLRP3 expression and IL-1β production. Mutations in NLRP3 are known to be responsible for three rare autoinflammatory disorders1,2. These results suggest that the NLRP3 region is also implicated in the susceptibility of more common inflammatory diseases such as Crohn's disease."

https://openalex.org/W2011771839,"Amyloid oligomers are believed to play causal roles in several types of amyloid-related neurodegenerative diseases. Several different types of amyloid oligomers have been reported that differ in morphology, size, or toxicity, raising the question of the pathological significance and structural relationships between different amyloid oligomers. Annular protofibrils (APFs) have been described in oligomer preparations of many different amyloidogenic proteins and peptides as ring-shaped or pore-like structures. They are interesting because their pore-like morphology is consistent with numerous reports of membrane-permeabilizing activity of amyloid oligomers. Here we report the preparation of relatively homogeneous preparations of APFs and an antiserum selective for APFs (αAPF) compared with prefibrillar oligomers (PFOs) and fibrils. PFOs appear to be precursors for APF formation, which form in high yield after exposure to a hydrophobic-hydrophilic interface. Surprisingly, preformed APFs do not permeabilize lipid bilayers, unlike the precursor PFOs. APFs display a conformation-dependent, generic epitope that is distinct from that of PFOs and amyloid fibrils. Incubation of PFOs with phospholipids vesicles results in a loss of PFO immunoreactivity with a corresponding increase in αAPF immunoreactivity, suggesting that lipid vesicles catalyze the conversion of PFOs into APFs. The annular anti-protofibril antibody also recognizes heptameric α-hemolysin pores, but not monomers, suggesting that the antibody recognizes an epitope that is specific for a β barrel structural motif.

Many age-related neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by the accumulation of amyloid deposits derived from a variety of misfolded proteins (1Dobson C.M. Protein Pept. Lett. 2006; 13: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). These diseases typically have both sporadic and inherited forms, and in many cases the mutations associated with the familial forms are in the gene encoding the protein that accumulates or in genes directly related to its production, processing, or accumulation (2Hardy J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2005; 33: 578-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The genetic linkage between the mutant allele and disease is evidence of the causal relationship of amyloid accumulation to pathogenesis, and many of the mutations either destabilize the natively folded state, produce more amyloidogenic protein, or they increase its propensity to aggregate (3Chiti F. Stefani M. Taddei N. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. Nature. 2003; 424: 805-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). Although fibrillar amyloid deposits are among the most obvious pathognomonic features of disease, their role in pathogenesis is not clear. The extent of fibrillar amyloid plaque deposition does not correlate well with Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis, and there are a significant number of non-demented individuals that have equivalent amounts of amyloid plaques as disease patients (4Terry R.D. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1996; 55: 1023-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Pathological changes are observed in transgenic animals before the onset of amyloid plaque accumulation (5Westerman M.A. Cooper-Blacketer D. Mariash A. Kotilinek L. Kawarabayashi T. Younkin L.H.

Soluble oligomers have been implicated as the primary toxic species in many degenerative diseases where the accumulation of large fibrillar deposits may be either inert, protective, or pathological by a different mechanism (for review, see Refs. 9Baglioni S.

PFOs appear at early times of incubation and disappear as mature fibrils appear (16Harper J.D. Wong S.S. Lieber C.M. Lansbury P.T. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 119-125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar, 17Lashuel H.A. Hartley D. Petre B.M. Walz T. Lansbury Jr., P.T.

At longer times of incubation PFOs appear to coalesce to form curvilinear beaded strings that have been called protofibrils and ring-shaped, pore-like structures referred to as annular protofibrils (APFs) (17Lashuel H.A. Hartley D. Petre B.M. Walz T. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Nature. 2002; 418: 291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar). APFs appear to be formed from the circularization of PFO subunits. A similar spectrum of PFOs and APFs has been observed for many types of amyloids, such as α-synuclein (19Conway K.A. Harper J.D. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2552-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar), islet amyloid (20Janson J. Ashley R.H. Harrison D. McIntyre S. Butler P.C. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar), and non-disease associated “neoamyloids” (21Bucciantini M. Giannoni E. Chiti F. Baroni F. Formigli L. Zurdo J. Taddei N. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. Stefani M. Nature. 2002; 416: 507-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (2145) Google Scholar). Although PFOs, APFs, and fibrils have been observed for many different types of amyloidogenic proteins and peptides (22Lashuel H.A. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Q. Rev. Biophys. 2006; 39: 167-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), their structures, interrelationships, and contributions to disease pathogenesis are not entirely clear. Insoluble fibrils and small soluble pieces of fibrils known as fibrillar oligomers appear to have a distinct and mutually exclusive underlying structure than PFOs because they display generic epitopes that are recognized by distinct conformation-dependent monoclonal antibodies (23Hrncic R.

It is not yet known whether APFs represent a unique conformation or whether they are structurally related to PFOs or fibrils. So far APFs have only been defined morphologically as pore-like structures and have been observed in preparations of PFOs and in fibril-containing preparations (27Hafner J.H. Cheung C.L. Woolley A.T. Lieber C.M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2001; 77: 73-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 28Shtilerman M.D. Ding T.T. Lansbury Jr., P.T.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10209-10217Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Familial mutations associated with inherited forms of Parkinson and Alzheimer diseases increase the formation of APFs, suggesting that their formation is related to pathogenic activity (17Lashuel H.A. Hartley D. Petre B.M. Walz T. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Nature. 2002; 418: 291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar, 30Lashuel H.A. Hartley D.M. Petre B.M. Wall J.S. Simon M.N. Walz T. Lansbury Jr., P.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 795-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Based on the close resemblance between APFs and bacterial pore-forming toxins, it has been proposed that APFs permeabilize membranes (22Lashuel H.A. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Q. Rev. Biophys. 2006; 39: 167-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Because membrane permeabilization is a common pathogenic activity of prefibrillar amyloid oligomers (31Glabe C.G. Kayed R. Neurology. 2006; 66: 74-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) and PFOs are a precursor to annular protofibril formation, the formation of APFs is an attractive explanation for the membrane permeabilization of oligomers because annular protofibril formation is also a common assembly state and they resemble pores morphologically. Investigating the pathological properties of Aβ APFs has been impeded by a lack of homogeneous preparations of annular structures and the lack of a facile means of distinguishing them from other aggregations states in vivo. Here we report the preparation of relatively homogeneous populations of APFs that have the same pore-like morphology previously described. We have used these preparations to examine their aggregation potential and membrane-permeabilizing properties and as an immunogen for the preparation of an antiserum that selectively recognizes APFs, compared with monomers, PFOs, and fibrils. APFs are stable and do not convert into fibrils or PFOs within months of incubation. APFs also exhibit much lower membrane-permeabilizing activity compared with the prefibrillar oligomer precursors to APF formation. Interaction with a hydrophobic-hydrophilic interface accelerates the conversion of PFOs into APFs. Incubation of PFOs with lipid vesicles results in a rapid loss of the prefibrillar oligomer specific epitope and the coordinate appearance of an annular protofibril-specific epitope. APFs display a unique conformation-dependent epitope that is distinct from PFOs and fibrils. Anti-annular protofibril antibody recognizes mature heptameric pores from α-hemolysin, suggesting that APFs may form β-barrel pore structures. Aβ and islet amyloid polypeptide peptides were synthesized by fluoren-9-ylmethoxy carbonyl chemistry using a continuous flow semiautomatic instrument as described previously (11Burdick D. Soreghan B. Kwon M. Kosmoski J. Knauer M. Henschen A. Yates J. Cotman C. Glabe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 546-554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). α-Synuclein was a gift from Dr. Ralf Langen. α-Hemolysin (H9395) was obtained from Sigma. Preparation and Characterization of APFs—Homogenous populations of annular (pore-like) protofibrils from different peptides and proteins was achieved by using PFOs as the starting material that were prepared as previously described (32Kayed R. Glabe C.G. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 413: 326-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). APFs were prepared by two different methods. PFOs were subjected to vigorous stirring in a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube containing four 18-gauge needle holes in the cap to allow for slow evaporation of the water and subsequent exposure of spherical oligomers to air-water interface. Alternatively, 5% (v/v) of hexane was added to a solution of PFOs, and the sample was mixed with a vortex mixer for 1 min every 5 min for a total 50 min. Afterward the samples were dialyzed in water using a molecular mass cut-off membrane of 10 kDa. The morphology of annular protofibril preparations was assessed by electron microscopy. 2 μl of the sample were adsorbed onto 200-mesh carbon and Formvar-coated grids, airdried, and washed for 1 min in distilled water. The samples were negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate (Ted Pella Inc., Redding, CA) for 2 min and viewed with a Zeiss 10CR microscope (80 kV). The thioflavin T binding properties of APFs was determined by adding 5-μl aliquots of each sample to a cuvette containing 145 μl of 3 μm thioflavin in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5 (33LeVine III, H. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 404-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (1931) Google Scholar). For thioflavin, the fluorescence emission spectrum was measured in the range (465 mm–600 nm) using a λ excitation at 442 nm. Fluorescence measurements were made with a Spex Fluorolog-2 spectrofluorometer. Preparation and Specificity of Anti-annular Protofibril Antiserum—Homogenous populations of APFs from Aβ42 were prepared as described above. Rabbits were immunized under an approved animal protocol with 0.15 mg of Aβ42 APFs (dialyzed at 4 °C against phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.6, overnight). For the first immunization equal parts of antigen and complete Freund's adjuvant were mixed together and used for immunization. Animals were injected subcutaneously at 5 sites in small increments of 0.1 ml per site in a checkerboard fashion on the scapular region. Booster immunizations were administered every 2 weeks using incomplete Freund's adjuvant. Serum was collected from the ear vein, allowed to clot, and centrifuged, and serum was frozen in aliquots. The specificity of the anti-annular protofibril antiserum (αAPF) was tested with ELISA and dot blot and Western blot assays. For ELISA plates were coated with 50 ng of different amyloid aggregates (monomer, fibrils, PFOs, and APFs) using (0.1 m sodium bicarbonate, pH 9.6) as coating buffer, incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, washed 3 times with (Tris-buffered saline (TBS)-Tween), then blocked for 1 h at 37 °C with (10% bovine serum albumin, TBS-T). The bovine serum albumin was IgG-free (Sigma). The plates were then washed 3 times with (TBS-T), and 100 μl of αAPF antiserum (diluted 1:2000 in 5% nonfat milk in TBS-T) was added and allowed to react for 1 h at 37 °C. The plates were then washed 3 times with TBS-T, and 100 μl of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit Ig (Promega) (diluted 1:10,000 in 5% nonfat milk in TBS-T) was added and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Finally, plates were washed 3 times with TBS-T and developed with 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB 1-component substrate) from KPL (Gaithersburg, MD). When the color developed, the reaction was stopped with 100 μl of 1 m HCl and read at 450 nm. For dot blots, the 0.2-μg samples (prepared as described above) were applied as 1-μl spots to a nitrocellulose membrane, allowed to dry at room temperature, then blocked with 10% nonfat milk in TBS-T at room temperature for 1 h, washed 3 times for 5 min with TBS-T, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with αAPF antiserum (IgG diluted 1:5000 in 5% nonfat milk in TBS-T or serum diluted 1:2000 in 5% nonfat milk in TBS-T). Membranes were washed 3 times for 5 min with TBS-T and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit Ig (Promega) (1:10,000 in 5% nonfat milk in TBS-T incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, membranes were washed three times with TBS-T and developed with ECL chemiluminescence kit from Amersham Biosciences. For Western blots Aβ APFs were prepared at 0.2–0.3 mg/ml, and pore-forming toxins (PFTs) were prepared at 0.1 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline. Samples were mixed with an equal volume (10 μl) of 2× sample buffer just before loading and maintained at 25 °C. Samples were run on Criterion gels (Bio-Rad) and transferred to nitrocellulose. αAPF antibody was used for detection (diluted 1:2000) as described above for dot blots. Membrane Permeabilization and Toxicity—Bilayers were formed at room temperature by the union of two monolayers as previously described (34Kayed R. Sokolov Y. Edmonds B. McIntire T.M. Milton S.C.

Briefly, lipid monolayers were opposed over a hole ∼150 μm in diameter in a 15-μm-thick Teflon partition dividing the two aqueous phases. The hole, punched by electric spark, was precoated with a 2.5% solution of squalene in n-pentane. Lipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Birmingham, AL). Salt solutions contained 10 mm KCl buffered by 10 mm HEPES-Tris to pH 7.4. Solutions were stirred with magnetic stirring bars for about 30 s after the additions. Bilayer formation was monitored by measuring capacitance. Silver/silver chloride wires were used as electrodes to apply voltages and record currents across the bilayer. The rear chamber potential was taken as ground, and additions were made to the front chamber. Voltages were generated and currents were digitized at a resolution of 12 bits by a National Instruments PCI-6024E board (National Instruments, Austin, TX) controlled by JCLAMP (SciSoft Co., New Haven, CT). Currents were transduced by an Axopatch 200A amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Viability of neurons was assessed using the MTT colorimetric assay (Invitrogen) as previously described (25Kayed R. Head E. Thompson J.L. McIntire T.M. Milton S.C. Cotman C.W. Glabe C.G. Science. 2003; 300: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (3424) Google Scholar). Briefly, SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells were treated with 2 μm Aβ APFs and PFOs. After incubation for 4 h at 37 °C, the cells were assayed using an MTT toxicity assay kit (Tox-1) (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's directions. All measurements were made in triplicate. Immunohistological Localization of APF in AD Brain—Brain tissue samples were obtained from the Institute for Brain Aging and Dementia Tissue Repository. Two cases were used. The first was an 84-year-old female with a mini-mental state examination score of 30, 7 months before death. The post-mortem interval for this case was 4.3 h, and the final neuropathology diagnosis was normal (Braak and Braak stage III). The second case was a 79-year-old male with a mini-mental state examination score of 6, 9 months before death. The post-mortem interval for this case was 6 h, and the final neuropathology diagnosis was Alzheimer disease (Braak and Braak stage VI). The midfrontal gyrus was dissected from 4% paraformaldehyde-fixed coronal slices and sectioned at 50 μm using a Vibratome. Free-floating sections were stored in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.02% sodium azide before use in immunohistochemical or histology experiments. Sections were washed with 0.1 m TBS, pH 7.5, and then pretreated with 3% hydrogen peroxide in 10% methanol to block endogenous peroxidase activity. Pretreatment with 90% formic acid for 4 min did not affect subsequent immunostaining. Sections were subsequently washed in TBS with 0.1% Triton X-100 (TBS-A) and then blocked for 30 min TBS-A with 3% bovine serum albumin (TBS-B). Sections were incubated overnight at room temperature in several αAPF primary antibody dilutions (1:100–1:5000). After two washes with TBS-A and a wash in TBS-B, sections were incubated in goat anti-rabbit-biotinylated anti-IgG and then in avidin biotin complex (ABC) (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Antibodies were visualized using 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB, Vector Laboratories). Sections were counterstained with cresyl violet before coverslipping using Depex mounting media. Liposome and Deoxycholate Treatment—Ten milligrams of phosphatidylcholines (Sigma) was dissolved in 500 μl of chloroform (20 mg/ml), the chloroform was evaporated under a stream of nitrogen in the hood, then the film was hydrated with 500 μl of buffer (10 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) and finally vortexed intensely for 3–5 min. Deoxycholate was used to promote oligomerization of α-hemolysin by incubating 6.25 mm α-hemolysin with 2 mg/ml deoxycholate at room temperature. Aβ42 oligomers were prepared at 66 μm in H2O and incubated at room temperature with liposome in phosphate-buffered saline (1/10 (v/v) liposome/Aβ oligomers). For ELISA, plates were coated with 100 ng/well peptide or protein and detected with anti-oligomer antibody (A-11), 1:5,000, anti-annular protofibril antibody (αAPF) 1:5,000, and anti-rabbit 1:10,000. Preparation and Properties of APFs—To examine the properties of Aβ APFs, we sought to establish reproducible methods for preparing them in relatively homogeneous populations. Because APFs are morphologically defined (17Lashuel H.A. Hartley D. Petre B.M. Walz T. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Nature. 2002; 418: 291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar), we used electron microscopy to evaluate the morphological purity of samples. We noticed that samples of PFOs spontaneously contain APFs as previously reported and that exposure of these samples to an air-water interface during drying increased the abundance of annular structures observed (data not shown). We also examined the effect of treating solutions of Aβ42 spherical PFOs (Fig. 1A) with 5% hexanes in water and vortexing the two phase system. This procedure resulted in the formation of large numbers of relatively homogeneous annular structures (Fig. 1B). The APFs have diameters ranging from ∼8 to 25 nm with a central opening or pore. When they are first formed, they appear to be made up of individual 3–5-nm spherical oligomeric subunits as previously reported. Upon further incubation for 7 days, the APFs lose this rough, beaded appearance and acquire a smooth appearance (Fig. 1B, inset). The APFs also appear to fuse at longer incubation times, giving rise to a lobular appearance. APFs of similar morphology, dimensions, and homogeneity were also obtained by the same methods with Aβ40 and α-synuclein (Fig. 1, C and D). No amyloid fibrils were observed by electron microscopy after incubation of APFs for up to 3 months either with or without seeding with fibrils, indicating that APFs are very stable and do not convert readily to fibrils under these conditions (data not shown). We also examined the secondary structure of APFs by circular dichroism spectroscopy (Fig. 1E). The spectrum demonstrates that APFs contain substantial β-sheet character. Membrane Permeabilization Activity and Toxicity of APFs—Because APFs have a pore-like morphology and amyloid oligomers have been reported to permeabilize membranes, we examined the effect of APFs on membrane conductivity (Fig. 2). Surprisingly, APFs have little membrane-permeabilizing activity compared with the PFOs that are used as precursors in annular protofibril formation. α-Synuclein APFs display weak permeabilizing activity with a conductivity of 40 pA at 4 μm (Fig. 2B), but this is much lower than the corresponding PFOs that give a conductivity of 1.2 nA at 2 μm (Fig. 2D). Because the annular protofibril preparations contain some residual PFOs (Fig. 1A), it is possible that the membrane-permeabilizing activity of the annular protofibril preparations may be due to contaminating PFOs rather than APFs. Recently a number of reports have shown that PFOs are more toxic than amyloid fibrils when applied exogenously to cells. We compared the toxicity of APFs and PFOs and found that the APFs are significantly less toxic (Fig. 3). Like the membrane-permeabilizing activity, the toxicity of APFs is less than that of the PFOs oligomers used to prepare them.FIGURE 3Comparison of the toxicity of APFs and PFOs. Cytotoxicity was measured using SHSY5Y cells and the MTT assay as described under “Experimental Procedures” using 2 μm APFs or PFOs. PFOs are significantly more toxic than APFs (p < 0.05).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Anti-APF Antiserum—The different morphology and activity of APFs and PFOs suggests that there may be underlying conformational differences that account for these differences. We examined whether these differences could be recognized by conformation-dependent antibodies that are specific for these different structural motifs. We prepared antisera by immunizing rabbits with purified preparations of Aβ42 APFs and characterized the specificity of the serum for different aggregation states of Aβ and other amyloidogenic proteins and peptides by ELISA (Fig. 4). The anti-annular protofibril antisera (αAPF) selectively recognize annular protofibril preparations and display significantly less reactivity with monomeric and fibrillar samples. The αAPF serum also demonstrates some reactivity with prefibrillar oligomer samples, but it is not clear whether this represents shared epitopes or the fact that prefibrillar fibrillar oligomer preparations contain some spontaneously formed APFs. A11 and OC antisera recognize generic conformation-dependent epitopes that are widely distributed without regard to amino acid sequence, so we examined whether αAPF recognizes APFs from other protein and peptide sequences (Fig. 5). αAPF specifically recognizes APFs from α-synuclein and islet amyloid polypeptide and does not recognize the monomeric forms of these proteins, indicating that αAPF also recognizes generic epitopes.FIGURE 5αAPF antiserum recognizes conformation-dependent generic epitopes that are independent of specific amino acid sequences. APFs and monomeric proteins and peptides were analyzed by ELISA for Aβ40 (▪), islet amyloid polypeptide (•), and a-synuclein (▴). Closed symbols, APFs. Open symbols, monomeric proteins and peptides.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We also compared the immunoreactivities of αAPF, A11, and OC antisera by dot blot analysis and Western blotting to test whether they have unique or overlapping specificities. Dot blots of monomer, APFs, PFOs, and fibrils reveal reactivity between PFOs, fibrils, and APFs with αAPF IgG (Fig. 6A). The reactivity of prefibrillar oligomer and fibril samples with αAPF may reflect overlapping immunoreactivities of the antisera or the difficulty of making pure samples of PFOs and fibrils in vitro that lack APFs. The latter is consistent with reports that APFs occur spontaneously in preparations o"

Here, we show that MRL proteins function as scaffolds that connect the membrane targeting sequences in Ras GTPases to talin, thereby recruiting talin to the plasma membrane and activating integrins. The MRL proteins bound directly to talin via short, N-terminal sequences predicted to form amphipathic helices. RIAM-induced integrin activation required both its capacity to bind to Rap1 and to talin. Moreover, we constructed a minimized 50-residue Rap-RIAM module containing the talin binding site of RIAM joined to the membrane-targeting sequence of Rap1A. This minimized Rap-RIAM module was sufficient to target talin to the plasma membrane and to mediate integrin activation, even in the absence of Rap1 activity. We identified a short talin binding sequence in Lamellipodin (Lpd), another MRL protein; talin binding Lpd sequence joined to a Rap1 membrane-targeting sequence is sufficient to recruit talin and activate integrins. These data establish the mechanism whereby MRL proteins interact with both talin and Ras GTPases to activate integrins.

Increased affinity (“activation”) of cellular integrins is central to physiological events such as cell migration, assembly of the extracellular matrix, the immune response, and hemostasis (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6765) Google Scholar). Each integrin comprises a type I transmembrane α and β subunit, each of which has a large extracellular domain, a single transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain (tail). Talin binds to most integrin β cytoplasmic domains and the binding of talin to the integrin β tail initiates integrin activation (2Petrich B.G. Fogelstrand P. Partridge A.W. Yousefi N. Ablooglu A.J.

Bacterial expression vector encoding His-tagged human full-length talin in pET30a was a generous gift from Dr. Liddington (Burnham Institute for Medical Research, La Jolla, CA). The authenticity of constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing.In Vitro Protein Interaction Assay—Bacterial expression plasmids encoding glutathione S-transferase (GST)-RIAM, GST-Lpd, their mutants, or GST vector were expressed in BL21(DE3) (Novagen, Madison, WI), and recombinant proteins were purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads according to manufacturer's instructions (GE Healthcare). His-tagged full-length talin was expressed in BL21(DE3) with 0.2 mm isopropyl 1-thio-d-galactopyranoside overnight at room temperature and purified using Ni-NTA His-bind® resin (Novagen) affinity matrix. Purified talin was dialyzed overnight in a buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 200 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm dithiothreitol).

Peptide inhibition assay was performed in conditions described above with purified RIAM peptides (GenScript Corp.), wild type (6–30, EDIDQMFSTLLGEMDLLTQSLGVDT), or mutant (6-30-4E, EDIDQEESTEEGEMDLLTQSLGVDT).Transient Transfection and Immunoprecipitation—A5 cells (Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing αIIbβ3) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with nonessential amino acids, l-glutamine, 10% fetal calf serum, and antibiotics. Lipofectamine and Plus reagents (Invitrogen) were used for transient transfection according to manufacturer's instruction.

Swollen cells were disrupted by Dounce homogenization, and a fraction (total cell lysate) was saved for analysis. The remainder lysate was centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 min to pellet nuclei and unbroken cells. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 30 min to pellet the membrane fraction, which was further washed and extracted in lysis buffer including 1% IGEPAL CA-630 at 4 °C. Total lysate and cytosolic and membrane fractions were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed for protein expression by Western blotting.Co-clustering of Integrin αIIbβ3 and Talin with RIAM or Lamellipodin—To label αIIbβ3 integrins, A5 cells transfected with mCherry-talin and various GFP-RIAM or GFP-Lpd constructs were incubated with 30 μg/ml D57-Alexa 647 (D57 monoclonal antibody directly conjugated to Alexa-Fluor 647 (Invitrogen)) for 20 min before plating on 10 μg/ml fibrinogen-coated coverslips. The cells were allowed to adhere for 30 min in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, rinsed once in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS. In some experiments, A5 cells were co-transfected with HA-Rap1GAP. After fixation and permeabilization in 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min, HA-Rap1GAP was immunostained using anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Covance Research Products) that was directly conjugated to Alexa-Fluor 350 (Invitrogen). Coverslips were subsequently mounted in Prolong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen) on slides. Epifluorescent images of cells were acquired with a 60× oil immersion objective on a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U microscope equipped with the appropriate excitation and emission filter sets (Semrock Inc, Rochester, NY). Images as shown are maximal projections of deconvolved images that were acquired at 0.1-μm z-section intervals. Images were deconvolved using the 3D Blind Deconvolution algorithm of Auto-QuantX (Media Cybernetics Inc, Bethesda, MD). Additional post-acquisition processing of images were performed using ImageJ (rsb.info.nih.gov/ij) and Adobe Photoshop.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONAn N-terminal 103-Residue Fragment of RIAM Binds Talin—RIAM mediates Rap1-dependent integrin activation by forming a complex containing activated Rap1, talin, and the integrin (23Han J. Lim C.J. Watanabe N. Soriani A. Ratnikov B. Calderwood D.A. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Lafuente E.M. Boussiotis V.A. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 1796-1806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). To investigate the mechanism by which RIAM forms this complex, we examined the interaction of various RIAM fragments with talin. cDNAs encoding influenza hemagglutinin epitope-tagged full-length talin (HA-talin) and GFP-tagged full-length RIAM or RIAM fragments were constructed and used to transfect Chinese hamster ovary cells that express recombinant integrin αIIbβ3 (A5 cells) (25Loftus J.C. O'Toole T.E. Plow E.F. Glass A. Frelinger III, A.L. Ginsberg M.H. Science. 1990; 249: 915-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). HA-talin was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody, and associated GFP-RIAM fragments were detected by Western blotting with an anti-GFP antibody. As expected, full-length RIAM interacted with talin (Fig. 1A). RIAM contains several modular domains; thus, we analyzed fragments that specifically deleted one or more of these domains. The C-terminal half of RIAM, containing the principal ENA/VASP binding sites and the PH domain (20Lafuente E.M. van Puijenbroek A.A. Krause M. Carman C.V. Freeman G.J. Berezovskaya A. Constantine E. Springer T.A. Gertler F.B. Boussiotis V.A. Dev. Cell. 2004; 7: 585-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), were dispensable for talin association because fragments lacking these domains (RIAM-(1–421) and RIAM-(1–301)) associated with talin, whereas a construct containing the RIAM C terminus (406–666) associated to a much lesser extent (Fig. 1A). A talin interacting site (1–301) was, thus, localized within a RIAM fragment that contains two coiled-coil regions (63–90 and 150–182) and a RA domain (Fig. 1A). RIAM-(1–301) was well expressed as a GST fusion protein in a prokaryotic expression system, affording us the opportunity to assess the direct binding of this region of RIAM to purified recombinant talin. Purified hexahistidine-tagged full-length recombinant talin (His6-talin) was incubated with GST-tagged fragments of RIAM (GST-RIAM) immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads, and bound talin was detected by protein staining after SDS-PAGE fractionation. Three GST-RIAM proteins containing the N terminus residues RIAM 1–301, 1–176, and 1–103 interacted with talin, whereas GST-RIAM-(104–666) or GST alone did not (Fig. 1B). Thus, talin interacts directly with RIAM, and the interaction is mediated by an N-terminal fragment that lacks the Rap1 binding RA domain, the PH domain, and most of the ENA/VASP binding motifs.Both Talin and Rap1 Binding Regions of RIAM Are Required for Integrin Activation—As noted above, RIAM-(1–176), which lacks the Rap1 binding domain, binds directly to talin. Because the activation state of Rap1 controls RIAM-dependent integrin αIIbβ3 activation (23Han J. Lim C.J. Watanabe N. Soriani A. Ratnikov B. Calderwood D.A. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Lafuente E.M. Boussiotis V.A. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 1796-1806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), we examined the capacity of this fragment to activate integrins in conjunction with talin. We first verified that there was low level spontaneous Rap1 activation in the Chinese hamster ovary cells (supplemental Fig. S1). We co-expressed GFP-RIAM fragments with HA-talin in A5 cells and used flow cytometry to assay the binding of an integrin αIIbβ3 activation-specific antibody, PAC1 (26Shattil S.J. Cunningham M. Hoxie J.A. Blood. 1987; 70: 307-315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells co-transfected with HA-talin and GFP-RIAM-(1–301), which contains both the talin and Rap1 binding sites, exhibited increased PAC1 binding (Fig. 2, A and B). In contrast, no increase in PAC1 binding was observed when talin was co-transfected with either GFP-RIAM-(1–176), which lacks the RA domain, or GFP-RIAM-(104–666), which contains the RA domain but not the talin binding site (Fig. 2, A and B). In these experiments we confirmed by immunoprecipitation that GFP-RIAM-(1–176) and GFP-RIAM-(1–301) associated with HA-talin in these cells, whereas GFP-RIAM-(104–666) failed to do so (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, as with full-length RIAM (23Han J. Lim C.J. Watanabe N. Soriani A. Ratnikov B. Calderwood D.A. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Lafuente E.M. Boussiotis V.A. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 1796-1806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), activation induced by RIAM-(1–301) depends on Rap1 activity, as it was blocked by co-transfection with Rap1GAP (Fig. 2D). Thus, RIAM-mediated integrin activation requires RIAM talin and RA binding domains and Rap activity.FIGURE 2The RA and talin binding domains of RIAM are required for integrin αIIbβ3 activation. A, A5 cells were transiently co-transfected with plasmids encoding HA-talin and GFP-RIAM-(1–301), -(1–176), -(104–666) or GFP as indicated.

Data are the means ± S.E. for n ≥ 3. Protein expression was assessed by Western blotting using anti-HA or anti-GFP antibodies. C, A5 cells were co-transfected with HA-talin and GFP-RIAM-(1–301), -(1–176), -(104–666), or GFP alone, and HA-talin was immunoprecipitated from the cell lysates with anti-HA antibody (12CA5). Co-immunoprecipitated proteins (IP talin) and protein expression in whole cell lysates (WCL) was assessed by Western blotting with antibodies against GFP for RIAM (upper panel) and against HA for talin (lower panel), as indicated. D, GFP-RIAM-(1–301) induced integrin activation was abolished upon co-transfection with Rap1GAP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Membrane-targeting Sequences of Ras Proteins Bypass the Requirement of Rap1 Activity for RIAM-dependent Integrin Activation—As noted above, the RA domain and Rap1 activity were needed for RIAM-(1–301) to promote integrin activation. Ras family proteins such as Rap1 contain a C-terminal CAAX box that specifies C-terminal prenylation, proteolytic cleavage, and carboxymethylation (27Gutierrez L. Magee A.I. Marshall C.J. Hancock J.F. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1093-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). In combination with nearby polybasic sequences and/or acylated Cys residues, this region of Ras family proteins plays a crucial role in the localization of these proteins to cellular membranes and to particular microdomains within these membranes (28Hancock J.F. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 373-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). To test the role of the membrane localization region of Rap1A in integrin activation, we joined the C-terminal 20 residues of Rap1A, which contains the CAAX box in combination with a Lys-rich region, with RIAM-(1–176), a fragment that contains the talin binding region but not the RA domain. Expression of GFP-RIAM-(1–176)-CAAX in combination with talin dramatically increased PAC1 binding to αIIbβ3, whereas as before, GFP-RIAM-(1–176) failed to do so (Fig. 3A). Because each RIAM construct was GFP-tagged, we were able to directly compare expression level with effect on integrin activation. The addition of the Rap1 membrane-localization sequence resulted in a >10-fold increase in the capacity of RIAM-(1–176) to activate integrin αIIbβ3 (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, integrin activation induced by GFP-RIAM-(1–176)-CAAX did not require Rap1 activity as it was insensitive to inhibition by Rap1GAP (Fig. 3C), indicating that RIAM-(1–176)-CAAX expression bypasses the requirement for Rap1 activity. The effect of RIAM-(1–176)-CAAX on integrin activation is dependent on the interaction between talin and integrin β3 cytoplasmic tail because GFP-RIAM-(1–176)-CAAX was not able to activate integrins when co-expressed with a talin mutant (talin(W359A)) that is deficient in binding to integrin β cytoplasmic domain (29Garcia-Alvarez B. de Pereda J.M.

These results strongly suggest that one important effect of Rap1 interaction with RIAM is to drive recruitment of a RIAM-talin complex to the plasma membrane.FIGURE 3Tethering membrane targeting sequences of Rap1 to RIAM-(1–176) bypasses Rap1 requirement for integrin activation. A5 cells were co-transfected with HA-talin and GFP-tagged RIAM-(1–176) constructs with or without Rap1GAP, as indicated. Integrin activation was assayed by PAC1 binding and quantified using flow cytometry as described in Fig. 2.

https://openalex.org/W1972491673,"Many animals display specific internal or external features with left-right asymmetry. In vertebrates, the molecular pathway that leads to this asymmetry uses the signalling molecule Nodal, a member of the transforming growth factor-beta superfamily, which is expressed in the left lateral plate mesoderm, and loss of nodal function produces a randomization of the left-right asymmetry of visceral organs. Orthologues of nodal have also been described in other deuterostomes, including ascidians and sea urchins, but no nodal orthologue has been reported in the other two main clades of Bilateria: Ecdysozoa (including flies and nematodes) and Lophotrochozoa (including snails and annelids). Here we report the first evidence for a nodal orthologue in a non-deuterostome group. We isolated nodal and Pitx (one of the targets of Nodal signalling) in two species of snails and found that the side of the embryo that expresses nodal and Pitx is related to body chirality: both genes are expressed on the right side of the embryo in the dextral (right-handed) species Lottia gigantea and on the left side in the sinistral (left-handed) species Biomphalaria glabrata. We pharmacologically inhibited the Nodal pathway and found that nodal acts upstream of Pitx, and that some treated animals developed with a loss of shell chirality. These results indicate that the involvement of the Nodal pathway in left-right asymmetry might have been an ancestral feature of the Bilateria."
https://openalex.org/W2067210504,"Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) act as effective and robust gateways between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, selecting for the passage of particular macromolecules across the nuclear envelope. NPCs comprise an elaborate scaffold that defines a approximately 30 nm diameter passageway connecting the nucleus and the cytoplasm. This scaffold anchors proteins termed 'phenylalanine-glycine' (FG)-nucleoporins, the natively disordered domains of which line the passageway and extend into its lumen. Passive diffusion through this lined passageway is hindered in a size-dependent manner. However, transport factors and their cargo-bound complexes overcome this restriction by transient binding to the FG-nucleoporins. To test whether a simple passageway and a lining of transport-factor-binding FG-nucleoporins are sufficient for selective transport, we designed a functionalized membrane that incorporates just these two elements. Here we demonstrate that this membrane functions as a nanoselective filter, efficiently passing transport factors and transport-factor-cargo complexes that specifically bind FG-nucleoporins, while significantly inhibiting the passage of proteins that do not. This inhibition is greatly enhanced when transport factor is present. Determinants of selectivity include the passageway diameter, the length of the nanopore region coated with FG-nucleoporins, the binding strength to FG-nucleoporins, and the antagonistic effect of transport factors on the passage of proteins that do not specifically bind FG-nucleoporins. We show that this artificial system faithfully reproduces key features of trafficking through the NPC, including transport-factor-mediated cargo import."

Protein Expression and Purification-The pRSETa vector containing GCaMP2 was a kind gift of Karel Svoboda (Janelia Farm Research Campus, Howard Hughes Medical Institute). GCaMP2 was expressed and purified as described previously (17Rodriguez Guilbe M.M. Alfaro Malave E.C. Akerboom J. Marvin J.S. Looger L.L. Schreiter E.R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Crystallogr. Commun. 2008; 64: 629-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Briefly, BL21(DE3) cells containing pRSETa harboring gcamp2 or gcamp2 mutants were grown in ZYM-5052 medium (18Studier F.W.

After centrifugation, cell lysis, and clarification, proteins were purified from the cell-free extract by nickel-affinity chromatography. Protein purity over 95% was confirmed by SDS-PAGE analysis. Proteins were dialyzed into 20 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, pH 8.0, and concentrated. Calcium-free samples were prepared identically, except the buffer contained 5 mm EGTA instead of CaCl2. Crystallization and Data Collection-All GCaMP crystallization was carried out at 20 °C. All GCaMP protein samples for crystallization were in 20 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, pH 8.0, except for the 8EF-apo mutant where the same buffer with 5 mm EGTA substituted for CaCl2 was used. All crystals used for data collection were grown using the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method in 24-well VDX plates. Crystallization of Ca2+-saturated dimeric GCaMP2 was described previously (17Rodriguez Guilbe M.M. Alfaro Malave E.C. Akerboom J. Marvin J.S. Looger L.L. Schreiter E.R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

The calcium-saturated K378W (at 5.6 mg/ml) and G87R (at 1.5 mg/ml) mutants crystallized ∼4 days after mixing with a precipitant solution consisting of 0.1 m magnesium formate dihydrate and 15% polyethylene glycol 3,350 using drop ratios of 2 μl of protein to 2 μl of precipitant for K378W and 1.5-2.5 μl for G87R. Ca2+-saturated monomeric GCaMP2 was crystallized identically to the K378W and G87R mutants using a drop ratio of 2 μl to 2 μl except that the drops were microseeded by streak seeding from K378W crystals immediately following setup. These crystals required more than 4 weeks to grow and had a distinct morphology. 8EF-apo GCaMP2 was crystallized after 1 week by mixing 2 μl of protein solution (9.5 mg/ml) with 2 μl of a precipitant solution consisting of 0.2 m lithium sulfate monohydrate, 0.1 m BisTris, pH 5.5, and 25% polyethylene glycol 3,350. All crystals were cryoprotected for data collection by quickly (<10 s) soaking in the precipitant solution supplemented with 20% glycerol and then mounted in a nitrogen gas stream at 100 K or plunged into liquid nitrogen for storage and transport to synchrotron beamlines. All data were collected at 100 K in a N2 gas stream. X-ray diffraction data for the G87R mutant was collected in-house on a Rigaku RU-H3R rotating copper anode x-ray generator, equipped with a Saturn 92 CCD detector and X-stream 2000 low-temperature system. Data for Ca2+-saturated monomeric GCaMP2 was collected at the Advanced Light Source, beamline 8.2.2. Diffraction data from crystals of Ca2+-dimer, K378W, and 8EF-apo GCaMP2 were collected at the Advance Photon Source, beamline 31-ID. X-ray diffraction data for G87R were integrated and scaled using d*TREK (19Pflugrath J.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

The G87R Ca2+-bound monomer mutant structure was solved by searching sequentially using the cpEGFP domain and CaM-M13 domains from the refined Ca2+-dimer structure and data between 29.3- and 2.8-Å resolution. Clear solutions were obtained in space group P41212 with translation function Z-scores of 43.1 and 21.3, respectively, for the two domains. Strong positive peaks in the difference map at the expected positions of the calcium ions in CaM (which were omitted from the MR model) indicated the correctness of the solutions. The K378W mutant crystals were isomorphous with those of the G87R mutant and the G87R model was used directly for rigid-body refinement against data from K378W crystals. The Ca2+-saturated monomeric GCaMP2 structure was solved using the refined K378W coordinates as a search model. A clear solution was obtained in space group P21212 with a translation function Z-score of 39.2 using data between 45.4- and 2.65-Å resolution. The 8EF-apo GCaMP2 calcium-free mutant structure was solved by searching for the cpEGFP domain from the Ca2+-dimer structure. A clear solution was obtained in space group C2 with a translation function Z-score of 18.9 using data between 31.9- and 2.8-Å resolution. Subsequently searching for the calcium-free N-terminal or C-terminal lobes of CaM (PDB code 1CFD (24Kuboniwa H. Tjandra N. Grzesiek S. Ren H. Klee C.B. Bax A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 768-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar)) did not reveal any clear solutions. Some positive difference density was present in the electron density maps calculated using the cpEGFP domain solution that suggested the position of the N-terminal lobe of CaM, which was placed manually into density and refined. The correctness of this CaM N-terminal lobe placement was indicated by additional positive difference density for the linker connecting cpEGFP and the CaM N-terminal lobe, which was subsequently built. All models were improved by iterative cycles of model building in Coot (25Emsley P. Cowtan K.

Open table in a new tab Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC)-All SEC was carried out using a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml min-1 in 20 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, pH 8.0, for calcium-saturated samples or with 5 mm EGTA in place of CaCl2 for calcium-free samples. Molecular weights were estimated by comparison with elution volumes of standard proteins (Bio-Rad). Sedimentation Velocity Analytical Ultracentrifugation-Analytical ultracentrifugation of GCaMP2 samples was carried out in a Beckman XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA) within the Biophysics Instrumentation Facility at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Absorbance scans at 280 nm were collected on calcium-free (24 μm) and calcium-saturated (28 μm) GCaMP2 samples in two-sector cells within a four-hole AnTi-60 rotor at 42,000 rpm. Data were collected at 20 °C in the same buffers as the SEC experiments. Absorbance scans were modeled using a continuous c(s) distribution within Sedfit (27Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3089) Google Scholar), correcting for buffer density and viscosity and using a partial specific volume of 0.7300 cm3 g-1. Molecular weight of observed species (Fig. 2B) was estimated based on the best-fit frictional ratio as determined by Sedfit for each sample. Two-photon Laser Scanning Microscopy of Neurons Expressing GCaMP2-To measure intracellular [GCaMP2], acute brain slices containing neurons expressing GCaMP2 were prepared and imaged as previously described (6Hires S.A. Tian L. Looger L.L. Brain Cell Biol. 2008; 36: 69-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 16Mao T. O'Connor D.H. Scheuss V. Nakai J. Svoboda K. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3e1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Purified GCaMP2 was diluted into pipette internal solution supplemented with 1 mm K2EGTA at 0.1, 1, and 10 μm concentrations. Each solution was drawn into a thin glass capillary (ID = 0.02 mm, Vitrocom number RT5002). Their fluorescence intensities were measured under two-photon excitation with identical parameters (910 nm excitation) to neuron imaging. 0.1 μm GCaMP2 was not bright enough to significantly exceed PMT dark current at laser powers used for neuronal imaging. Intracellular GCaMP2 concentration in neurons with robust fluorescent responses to action potential firing was estimated by a linear extrapolation from the purified 10 μm GCaMP2 fluorescence intensity. Intracellular GCaMP2 was assumed to be in the apo state (6Hires S.A. Tian L. Looger L.L. Brain Cell Biol. 2008; 36: 69-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Generation and Screening of GCaMP2 Mutants-Mutants of GCaMP2 were prepared by site-directed mutagenesis (see supplemental Tables S1-S3) and confirmed by sequencing. Preliminary screening for variants with altered oligomerization equilibria (supplemental Table S1) was performed by passing 100-μl aliquots of cell-free extract from 200-ml cultures of overexpressed GCaMP2 over a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column while monitoring the absorption at 280 and 495 nm. Spectrophotometric Analysis-Absorbance spectra were obtained in a Safire2 (Tecan) with UVStar 96-well plates (Greiner) for both the calcium-free (10 mm EGTA) and calcium-loaded state (10 mm CaCl2). For fluorescence spectra, Fluotrac 200 plates (Greiner) were used. Samples were diluted 10-fold in zero free calcium buffer (Invitrogen) (30 mm MOPS, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm EGTA, pH 7.2) for calcium-free spectra, and in 39 μm free calcium buffer (Invitrogen) (30 mm MOPS, 10 mm Ca-EGTA in 100 mm KCl, pH 7.2) for calcium-loaded spectra. For absorbance measurements, samples were dialyzed into 20 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, and EGTA or CaCl2 was added to a final concentration of 10 mm. Structural Analysis of Dimeric Ca2+-GCaMP2-To understand the molecular mechanism of Ca2+-dependent fluorescence signal change and facilitate efforts to improve GCaMP properties, we set out to determine structures of the calcium-free and calcium-bound states of GCaMP2. Initial efforts to crystallize affinity purified, calcium-saturated GCaMP2 led to a single crystallization hit, as described previously (17Rodriguez Guilbe M.M. Alfaro Malave E.C. Akerboom J. Marvin J.S. Looger L.L. Schreiter E.R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Crystallogr. Commun. 2008; 64: 629-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The structure was solved by molecular replacement, and the final model revealed a domain-swapped dimer of GCaMP2 in the crystals, with the M13 peptide of each monomer bound by the calcium-loaded CaM of the other (Fig. 1B and Table 1). The finding of a domain-swapped dimer structure was unexpected, given that GCaMP has previously been characterized as a monomer (9Nakai J. Ohkura M. Imoto K. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar). We therefore characterized the oligomeric distribution of GCaMP2 in solution using several biophysical techniques. Solution Characterization of GCaMP2-SEC analysis of affinity purified GCaMP2 in the absence of calcium showed a single peak close to the elution volume predicted for the monomeric form of GCaMP2, when compared with the elution volume of standard proteins (Fig. 2A). However, in the presence of saturating calcium, two peaks eluted. The two peaks were assigned as a monomeric form with a higher elution volume than the calcium-free monomer, and a smaller population of dimeric GCaMP2. Analytical ultracentrifugation of GCaMP2 in the presence and absence of calcium gave results similar to SEC (Fig. 2B), as did dynamic light scattering (data not shown). These results indicate that calcium-bound GCaMP2 is more compact than calcium-free, consistent with data for calmodulin and M13pep (24Kuboniwa H. Tjandra N. Grzesiek S. Ren H. Klee C.B. Bax A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 768-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar, 28Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A. Science. 1992; 257: 1251-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar, 29Zhang M. Tanaka T. Ikura M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 758-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). The observed dimeric structure, which preferentially crystallized in the initial screen, presumably represents the larger species in solution observed by SEC and analytical ultracentrifugation. After separation of the monomeric and dimeric calcium-saturated forms of GCaMP2 by SEC, neither showed significant presence of the other oligomeric state when re-analyzed days later, indicating that the kinetics of the monomer ↔ dimer equilibrium are very slow in the presence of saturating calcium. The monomeric and dimeric forms of Ca2+-bound GCaMP2 have different absorption and fluorescence properties (Fig. 2C), suggesting an altered chromophore environment between the states. Monitoring absorbance at both 280 and 495 nm, as well as fluorescence at 488/510 nm during SEC separation of purified GCaMP2 monomer and dimer clearly indicated that the dimeric species had significantly lower chromophore absorption and fluorescence. Fluorescence absorbance/excitation and emission scans of freshly separated monomeric and dimeric Ca2+-GCaMP2 indicated that apo, monomer, and dimer had nearly identical peak wavelengths for excitation and emission, but that the dimeric fraction was less fluorescent than the monomeric fraction, although both are substantially more fluorescent than the apo fraction (Fig. 2D). Comparison of the absorbance spectra of the three states shows that the chromophore environment changes dramatically upon Ca2+ binding: the protonated non-fluorescent state of the GCaMP2 chromophore is diminished upon Ca2+ binding, indicated by the smaller band at 400 nm in both Ca2+-saturated states, explaining the mechanism of the calcium-dependent fluorescence increase. The presence of a larger proportional amount of protonated non-fluorescent chromophore in the dimeric fraction compared with the monomeric fraction is in agreement with the SEC data (Fig. 2C), indicating that the monomeric GCaMP2 species is brighter than dimeric GCaMP2. [GCaMP2] in Neurons-Calcium imaging experiments may be adversely affected by contribution from two competing species in situ. We thus attempted to quantitate the monomerdimer equilibrium present at physiologically relevant GCaMP concentrations. Two-photon laser scanning microscopy of in utero electroporated GCaMP2 under control of the CAG promoter was used to estimate sensor concentration in an acute slice of mouse somatosensory cortex, by comparison with a concentration series of purified Ca2+-free GCaMP2 protein in thin-window cuvettes (supplemental Fig. S2). Under these conditions, intracellular [GCaMP2] was found to be ∼10 μm. A previous report expressing GCaMP2 in transgenic mouse heart from a modified α myosin heavy chain promoter estimated the intracellular concentration to be 1.6 μm (13Tallini Y.N. Ohkura M. Choi B.R. Ji G. Imoto K. Doran R. Lee J. Plan P. Wilson J. Xin H.B. Sanbe A. Gulick J. Mathai J. Robbins J. Salama G. Nakai J. Kotlikoff M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 4753-4758Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). To understand what fraction of calcium-saturated GCaMP2 should be dimeric at these intracellular concentrations, we removed calcium from purified GCaMP2 protein with excess EGTA, prepared a dilution series of GCaMP2, added back excess calcium, and observed the proportion of monomeric and dimeric GCaMP2 using analytical SEC (supplemental Fig. S3). At the concentrations seen in the brain slice, only ∼5% of the GCaMP2 was present as a dimer, suggesting that the monomeric sensor predominates under the conditions of typical imaging experiments. Engineering Monomeric GCaMP2-Given that the Ca2+-GCaMP2 dimer is presumably not the predominant form under imaging experimental conditions, we attempted to determine the structure of the monomeric form of Ca2+-GCaMP2. Preparative separation of the Ca2+-GCaMP2 monomer by SEC and immediate crystallization screening led only to crystals of the dimeric form that grew after several weeks. To aid crystallization of the monomeric form, we made a series of single amino acid substitutions in GCaMP2 to selectively disrupt dimerization, based on visual inspection of the Ca2+-GCaMP2 dimer structure. Eleven single amino acid substitutions in GCaMP2 were chosen and produced by site-directed mutagenesis (supplemental Table S1). Six of these mutations appeared to decrease the amount of GCaMP2 dimer present in purified protein samples as analyzed by SEC (supplemental Fig. S4). Sparse-matrix crystallization screening was carried out with these six GCaMP2 mutants, and two of them (GCaMP2 G87R (gfp G174R) and GCaMP2 K378W (cam K75W), where gfp refers to green fluorescent protein and cam refers to calmodulin) crystallized with a unique morphology under conditions distinct from those used for dimer crystallization (a topology diagram and amino acid sequence displaying both GCaMP and EGFP/CaM numbering are provided in supplemental Figs. S5 and S6, respectively). Although the G87R and K378W mutations appear to decrease dimer formation, the ΔF/F0 for each was not significantly altered (supplemental Table S1) suggesting that the mutations did not disrupt sensor function. X-ray diffraction data were collected from these new mutant crystals, and the structure was determined by molecular replacement using the cpEGFP and CaM-M13 domains from the dimer structure. The relative orientations of the cpEGFP and CaM-M13 domains revealed that the quaternary organization was different from the dimer structure, and electron density corresponding to the inter-domain linkers clearly showed that the structure represented the monomeric form of Ca2+-GCaMP2. Structural Analysis of Monomeric Ca2+-GCaMP2-Subsequently, crystals of the native Ca2+-GCaMP2 monomer were grown by seeding drops of Ca2+-GCaMP2 protein with microcrystals of the GCaMP2 K378W monomer. Solution of the Ca2+-GCaMP2 monomer structure by molecular replacement revealed that although these crystals were grown by seeding with K378W microcrystals, they were distinct from the G87R, K378W, and GCaMP"
https://openalex.org/W1977329434,"Ligand binding to structural elements in the non-coding regions of messenger RNA modulates gene expression. Ligands such as free metabolites or other small molecules directly bind and induce conformational changes in regulatory RNA elements known as riboswitches. Other types of RNA switches are activated by complexed metabolites-for example, RNA-ligated metabolites such as aminoacyl-charged transfer RNA in the T-box system, or protein-bound metabolites in the glucose- or amino-acid-stimulated terminator-anti-terminator systems. All of these switch types are found in bacteria, fungi and plants. Here we report an RNA switch in human vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGFA, also known as VEGF) mRNA 3' untranslated region (UTR) that integrates signals from interferon (IFN)-gamma and hypoxia to regulate VEGFA translation in myeloid cells. Analogous to riboswitches, the VEGFA 3' UTR undergoes a binary conformational change in response to environmental signals. However, the VEGFA 3' UTR switch is metabolite-independent, and the conformational change is dictated by mutually exclusive, stimulus-dependent binding of proteins, namely, the IFN-gamma-activated inhibitor of translation complex and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L (HNRNPL, also known as hnRNP L). We speculate that the VEGFA switch represents the founding member of a family of signal-mediated, protein-dependent RNA switches that evolved to regulate gene expression in multicellular animals in which the precise integration of disparate inputs may be more important than the rapidity of response."

Here, we report that in AD patients and two mouse models of AD, overexpression of serum response factor (SRF) and myocardin (MYOCD) in cerebral vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) generates an Abeta non-clearing VSMC phenotype through transactivation of sterol regulatory element binding protein-2, which downregulates low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1, a key Abeta clearance receptor. Hypoxia stimulated SRF/MYOCD expression in human cerebral VSMCs and in animal models of AD. We suggest that SRF and MYOCD function as a transcriptional switch, controlling Abeta cerebrovascular clearance and progression of AD."
https://openalex.org/W2025535065,"The aberrant activation of tyrosine kinases represents an important oncogenic mechanism, and yet the majority of such events remain undiscovered. Here we describe a bead-based method for detecting phosphorylation of both wild-type and mutant tyrosine kinases in a multiplexed, high-throughput and low-cost manner. With the aim of establishing a tyrosine kinase-activation catalog, we used this method to profile 130 human cancer lines. Follow-up experiments on the finding that SRC is frequently phosphorylated in glioblastoma cell lines showed that SRC is also activated in primary glioblastoma patient samples and that the SRC inhibitor dasatinib (Sprycel) inhibits viability and cell migration in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Testing of dasatinib-resistant tyrosine kinase alleles confirmed that SRC is indeed the relevant target of dasatinib, which inhibits many tyrosine kinases. These studies establish the feasibility of tyrosine kinome-wide phosphorylation profiling and point to SRC as a possible therapeutic target in glioblastoma."
https://openalex.org/W2050461547,"Donald Ganem and colleagues report a microarray-based approach to identify microRNA targets. They identify BCLAF1 as a target of miR-K5, a microRNA encoded by the Kaposi's sarcoma–associated herpesvirus. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short noncoding RNAs of cellular1 and viral origin2,3,4,5,6,7 that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression through imperfect base pairing to their mRNA targets. Because the recognition sequences of miRNAs for their targets are short and may be discontinuous, bioinformatic prediction of targets is difficult. Here we present an approach to the experimental identification of the mRNA targets of miRNAs encoded by the Kaposi's sarcoma–associated herpesvirus (KSHV). KSHV encodes 17 miRNAs, derived from 12 pre-miRNAs expressed from a single locus during viral latency2,5,6,7,8,9,10. We conducted multiple screens that examine small changes in transcript abundance under different conditions of miRNA expression or inhibition and then searched the identified transcripts for seed sequence matches. Using this strategy, we identified BCLAF1, encoding Bcl2-associated factor, as a target for miR-K5, and further analysis revealed that several other KSHV miRNAs also target this gene product. Our results support that this type of expression profiling provides a potentially general approach to the identification of miRNA targets."
https://openalex.org/W1991539695,"Both p53 and its repressor Mdm2 are subject to ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. We show that knockdown of the deubiquitinating enzyme USP5 (isopeptidase T) results in an increase in the level and transcriptional activity of p53. Suppression of USP5 stabilizes p53, whereas it has little or no effect on the stability of Mdm2. This provides a mechanism for transcriptional activation of p53. USP5 knockdown interferes with the degradation of ubiquitinated p53 rather than attenuating p53 ubiquitination. <i>In vitro</i> studies have shown that a preferred substrate for USP5 is unanchored polyubiquitin. Consistent with this, we observed for the first time in a mammalian system that USP5 makes a major contribution to Lys-48-linked polyubiquitin disassembly and that suppression of USP5 results in the accumulation of unanchored polyubiquitin chains. Ectopic expression of a C-terminal mutant of ubiquitin (G75A/G76A), which also causes the accumulation of free polyubiquitin, recapitulates the effects of USP5 knockdown on the p53 pathway. We propose a model in which p53 is selectively stabilized because the unanchored polyubiquitin that accumulates after USP5 knockdown is able to compete with ubiquitinated p53 but not with Mdm2 for proteasomal recognition. This raises the possibility that there are significant differences in proteasomal recognition of p53 and Mdm2. These differences could be exploited therapeutically. Our study reveals a novel mechanism for regulation of p53 and identifies USP5 as a potential target for p53 activating therapeutic agents for the treatment of cancer."

https://openalex.org/W1964860185,"Transcriptional activity of HIF-1 (hypoxia-inducible factor-1) has been reported to be up-regulated in solid tumors after ionizing radiation; however, the molecular mechanism underlying the response remains to be elucidated. In the present study, we performed a series of molecular imaging experiments using a HIF-1-dependent reporter gene, <i>5HREp-ODD-luc</i>, and found an essential role of the Akt/mTOR pathway. Hypoxic tumor cells distant from blood vessels were dramatically reoxygenated at 24 h postirradiation, and HIF-1 activity increased as HIF-1α accumulated in the reoxygenated regions. The accumulation was inhibited with a nonmetabolizable glucose analog, 2-deoxy-d-glucose, through the suppression of radiation-induced phosphorylation of Akt in the reoxygenated regions. Akt knockdown and an mTOR inhibitor revealed the importance of the Akt/mTOR pathway in the postirradiation accumulation of HIF-1α. <i>In vitro</i> experiments confirmed that an increase in glucose availability induced Akt phosphorylation under reoxygenated conditions and consequently up-regulated HIF-1α translation. Moreover, both the accelerated translation and the previously reported reactive oxygen species-mediated stabilization of HIF-1α protein were essential to the activation of HIF-1. All of these results indicate that Akt/mTOR-dependent translation of HIF-1α plays a critical role in the postirradiation up-regulation of intratumoral HIF-1 activity in response to radiation-induced alterations of glucose and oxygen availability in a solid tumor."
https://openalex.org/W2097575470,"Comparisons of chromosome X and the autosomes can illuminate differences in the histories of males and females as well as shed light on the forces of natural selection. We compared the patterns of variation in these parts of the genome using two datasets that we assembled for this study that are both genomic in scale. Three independent analyses show that around the time of the dispersal of modern humans out of Africa, chromosome X experienced much more genetic drift than is expected from the pattern on the autosomes. This is not predicted by known episodes of demographic history, and we found no similar patterns associated with the dispersals into East Asia and Europe. We conclude that a sex-biased process that reduced the female effective population size, or an episode of natural selection unusually affecting chromosome X, was associated with the founding of non-African populations."
https://openalex.org/W2156198928,"Aberrant neuronal migration during development leads to defects in cortical development and to an increased seizure susceptibility. Now, Joseph LoTurco and his colleagues show that it is possible to re-invoke neuronal migration perinatally in rodents and reposition neurons into their correct cortical location ( pages 17–18 ). Disorders of neuronal migration can lead to malformations of the cerebral neocortex that greatly increase the risk of seizures. It remains untested whether malformations caused by disorders in neuronal migration can be reduced by reactivating cellular migration and whether such repair can decrease seizure risk. Here we show, in a rat model of subcortical band heterotopia (SBH) generated by in utero RNA interference of the Dcx gene, that aberrantly positioned neurons can be stimulated to migrate by reexpressing Dcx after birth. Restarting migration in this way both reduces neocortical malformations and restores neuronal patterning. We further find that the capacity to reduce SBH continues into early postnatal development. Moreover, intervention after birth reduces the convulsant-induced seizure threshold to a level similar to that in malformation-free controls. These results suggest that disorders of neuronal migration may be eventually treatable by reengaging developmental programs both to reduce the size of cortical malformations and to reduce seizure risk."
https://openalex.org/W1963709177,"The C.elegans anchor cell is a model for cellular invasion through the basement membrane. Now netrin (UNC-6) is found to polarize the actin regulators Ena/VASP and PtdIns (4,5)P2 towards the basement membrane to promote anchor cell invasion. Despite their profound importance in the development of cancer, the extracellular cues that target cell invasion through basement membrane barriers remain poorly understood1. A central obstacle has been the difficulty of studying the interactions between invading cells and basement membranes in vivo2,3. Using the genetically and visually tractable model of Caenorhabditis elegans anchor cell (AC) invasion, we show that UNC-6 (netrin) signalling, a pathway not previously implicated in controlling cell invasion in vivo, is a key regulator of this process. Site of action studies reveal that before invasion, localized UNC-6 secretion directs its receptor, UNC-40, to the plasma membrane of the AC, in contact with the basement membrane. There, UNC-40 polarizes a specialized invasive membrane domain through the enrichment of actin regulators, F-actin and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2). Cell ablation experiments indicate that UNC-6 promotes the formation of invasive protrusions from the AC that break down the basement membrane in response to a subsequent vulval cue. Together, these results characterize an invasive membrane domain in vivo, and reveal a role for UNC-6 (netrin) in polarizing this domain towards its basement membrane target."
https://openalex.org/W1998660934,"Background Quinones are compounds extensively used in studies of oxidative stress due to their role in plants as chemicals for defense. These compounds are of great interest for pharmacologists and scientists, in general, because several cancer chemotherapeutic agents contain the quinone nucleus. However, due to differences in structures and diverse pharmacological effects, the exact toxicity mechanisms exerted by quinones are far from elucidatation. Methodology/Principal Findings Using Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we evaluated the main mechanisms of toxicity of two naphthoquinones, menadione and plumbagin, by determining tolerance and oxidative stress biomarkers such as GSH and GSSG, lipid peroxidation levels, as well as aconitase activity. The importance of glutathione transferases (GST) in quinone detoxification was also addressed. The GSSG/GSH ratio showed that menadione seemed to exert its toxicity mainly through the generation of ROS while plumbagin acted as an electrophile reacting with GSH. However, the results showed that, even by different pathways, both drugs were capable of generating oxidative stress through their toxic effects. Our results showed that the control strain, BY4741, and the glutathione transferase deficient strains (gtt1Δ and gtt2Δ) were sensitive to both compounds. With respect to the role of GST isoforms in cellular protection against quinone toxicity, we observed that the Gtt2 deficient strain was unable to overcome lipid peroxidation, even after a plumbagin pre-treatment, indicating that this treatment did not improve tolerance when compared with the wild type strain. Cross-tolerance experiments confirmed distinct cytotoxicity mechanisms for these naphthoquinones since only a pre-treatment with menadione was able to induce acquisition of tolerance against stress with plumbagin. Conclusions/Significance These results suggest different responses to menadione and plumbagin which could be due to the fact that these compounds use different mechanisms to exert their toxicity. In addition, the Gtt2 isoform seemed to act as a general protective factor involved in quinone detoxification."
https://openalex.org/W1998583950,"Hypoxia induces a variety of cellular responses such as cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and autophagy. Most of these responses are mediated by the hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha. To induce target genes, hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha requires a chromatin environment conducive to allow binding to specific sequences. Here, we have studied the role of the chromatin-remodeling complex SWI/SNF in the cellular response to hypoxia. We find that SWI/SNF is required for several of the cellular responses induced by hypoxia. Surprisingly, hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha is a direct target of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex. SWI/SNF components are found associated with the hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha promoter and modulation of SWI/SNF levels results in pronounced changes in hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha expression and its ability to transactivate target genes. Furthermore, impairment of SWI/SNF function renders cells resistant to hypoxia-induced cell cycle arrest. These results reveal a previously uncharacterized dependence of hypoxia signaling on the SWI/SNF complex and demonstrate a new level of control over the hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha system."
https://openalex.org/W1993222068,"The prion protein PrP(C) is infamous for its role in disease, but its normal physiological function remains unknown. Here we found a previously unknown behavioral phenotype of Prnp(-/-) mice in an odor-guided task. This phenotype was manifest in three Prnp knockout lines on different genetic backgrounds, which provides strong evidence that the phenotype is caused by a lack of PrP(C) rather than by other genetic factors. Prnp(-/-) mice also showed altered behavior in a second olfactory task, suggesting that the phenotype is olfactory specific. Furthermore, PrP(C) deficiency affected oscillatory activity in the deep layers of the main olfactory bulb, as well as dendrodendritic synaptic transmission between olfactory bulb granule and mitral cells. Notably, both the behavioral and electrophysiological alterations found in Prnp(-/-) mice were rescued by transgenic neuronal-specific expression of PrP(C). These data suggest that PrP(C) is important in the normal processing of sensory information by the olfactory system."
https://openalex.org/W1493071120,"Separation of intertwined sister chromatids, mediated by topoisomerase II, is essential for mitosis. In a separate mechanism, phosphorylation of topoisomerase II at Ser 1524 during the G2/M phase of the cell cycle recruits MDC1 to activate the decatenation checkpoint required for genomic stability. Topoisomerase II (Topo II) is required to separate intertwined sister chromatids before chromosome segregation can occur in mitosis1. However, it remains to be resolved whether Topo II has any role in checkpoint control. Here we report that when phosphorylated, Ser 1524 of Topo IIα acts as a binding site for the BRCT domain of MDC1 (mediator of DNA damage checkpoint protein-1), thereby recruiting MDC1 to chromatin. Although Topo IIα–MDC1 interaction is not required for checkpoint activation induced by DNA damage, it is required for activation of the decatenation checkpoint. Mutation of Ser 1524 results in a defective decatenation checkpoint. These results reveal an important role of Topo II in checkpoint activation and in the maintenance of genomic stability."
https://openalex.org/W2070707702,"Brain activity is continuously modulated, even at ""rest"". The alpha rhythm (8-12 Hz) has been known as the hallmark of the brain's idle-state. However, it is still debated if the alpha rhythm reflects synchronization in a distributed network or focal generator and whether it occurs spontaneously or is driven by a stimulus. This EEG/fMRI study aimed to explore the source of alpha modulations and their distribution in the resting brain. By serendipity, while computing the individually defined power modulations of the alpha-band, two simultaneously occurring components of these modulations were found. An 'induced alpha' that was correlated with the paradigm (eyes open/ eyes closed), and a 'spontaneous alpha' that was on-going and unrelated to the paradigm. These alpha components when used as regressors for BOLD activation revealed two segregated activation maps: the 'induced map' included left lateral temporal cortical regions and the hippocampus; the 'spontaneous map' included prefrontal cortical regions and the thalamus. Our combined fMRI/EEG approach allowed to computationally untangle two parallel patterns of alpha modulations and underpin their anatomical basis in the human brain. These findings suggest that the human alpha rhythm represents at least two simultaneously occurring processes which characterize the 'resting brain'; one is related to expected change in sensory information, while the other is endogenous and independent of stimulus change."
https://openalex.org/W2056019859,"Hyperpigmentation of the skin is characterized by increases in melanin synthesis and deposition. Although considered a significant psychosocial distress, little is known about the detailed mechanisms of hyperpigmentation. Recently, the tumor suppressor protein p53 has been demonstrated to promote ultraviolet B-induced skin pigmentation by stimulating the transcription of a melanogenic cytokine, POMC (pro-opiomelanocortin), in keratinocytes. Given that p53 can be activated by various kinds of diverse stresses, including sun exposure, inflammation, and aging, this finding led us to examine the involvement of p53 in cytokine receptor signaling, which might result in skin hyperpigmentation. Immunohistochemical and reverse transcription-PCR analyses revealed the increased expression and phosphorylation of p53 in the epidermis of hyperpigmented spots, accompanied by the higher expression of melanogenic cytokines, including stem cell factor, endothelin-1, and POMC. The involvement of p53 in hyperpigmentation was also indicated by the significantly higher expression of p53 transcriptional targets in the epidermis of hyperpigmented spots. Treatment of human keratinocytes and melanocytes with known p53 activators or inhibitors, including pifithrin-α (PFT), demonstrated significant increases or decreases, respectively, in the expression of melanogenic factors, including cytokines and their receptors. Additionally, PFT administration abolished stem cell factor-induced phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase in human melanocytes. Furthermore, when organ-cultured hyperpigmented spots, in vitro human skin substitutes, and mouse skin were treated with PFT or p53 small interfering RNA, the expression of melanogenic cytokines and their receptors was significantly decreased, as were levels of tyrosinase and melanogenesis. Taken together, these data reveal the essential role of p53 in hyperpigmentation of the skin via the regulation of paracrine-cytokine signaling, both in keratinocytes and in melanocytes.

There are various types of hyperpigmentations (pigmented spots) of the skin characterized by increases in melanin synthesis and deposition, such as freckles, postinflammatory hyperpigmentation, UV-induced pigmentation (UV-melanoses), senile lentigines (age spots), pigmentation petaloides actinica, and melasma. These hyperpigmentations are well known to cause significant psychosocial distress, but little is known about their detailed mechanisms. Hyperpigmentation generally results from three major steps in the epidermis: the proliferation of melanocytes, the synthesis and activation of tyrosinase to produce melanin, and the transfer of melanosomes to keratinocytes (1Rosdahl I.K.

During the process of melanosome transfer from melanocytes to keratinocytes, the expression of a melanosome phagocytic protein, PAR2 (protease-activated receptor 2), is induced by UV irradiation, and inhibition of PAR2 activation prevents UVB-induced pigmentation in Yucatan swine skin (24Seiberg M.

In UVB-induced pigmentation, which disappears a few months after the initial exposure, we previously demonstrated that the expression of SCF and ET-1 is remarkably enhanced at the mRNA transcript and protein levels in the earlier and later phases of UVB-induced pigmentation, respectively (23Hachiya A. Kobayashi A. Yoshida Y. Kitahara T. Takema Y. Imokawa G. Am. J. Pathol. 2004; 165: 2099-2109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). SCF and ET-1 are both potent mitogens and melanogens, and they synergistically activate the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 2The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; UVB, ultraviolet B; 5-FU, 5-fluorouracil; PFT, pifithrin-α; NHEK, normal human epidermal keratinocyte; NHEM, normal human epidermal melanocyte; HSS, human skin substitute; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; siRNA, small interfering RNA; RT, reverse transcription. in human melanocytes (9Imokawa G.

Chem. 2000; 275: 33321-33328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). SCF also stimulates the expression of ETBR (endothelin B receptor) so that its enhanced expression is harmonized with that of ET-1 in human epidermis (23Hachiya A. Kobayashi A. Yoshida Y. Kitahara T. Takema Y. Imokawa G. Am. J. Pathol. 2004; 165: 2099-2109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Taken together, those findings suggest that the biphasic expression of SCF and ET-1 intrinsically plays a pivotal role in the proliferation and melanogenesis of human melanocytes in vivo during UVB-induced hyperpigmentation. In addition to UVB-induced pigmentation, the contribution of two receptor-mediated signaling cascades (ET-1/ETBR and SCF/KIT) has also been reported to play a role in the formation of one type of persistent hyperpigmentation, senile lentigines, in which both long term sun exposure and chronological aging are thought to be involved (26Kadono S. Manaka I. Kawashima M. Kobayashi T. Imokawa G. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2001; 116: 571-577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 27Hattori H. Kawashima M. Ichikawa Y. Imokawa G. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2004; 122: 1256-1265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The higher expression of both ET-1 and SCF has been confirmed in the lesional skin of senile lentigines compared with control perilesional skin. These cytokine receptor networks have also been reported to be involved in other human hyperpigmentation disorders, such as dermatofibromas, café-au-lait macules, and seborrehoic keratoses (28Teraki E.

Such evidence indicates that the mechanisms of several types of hyperpigmentation, such as UV-induced pigmentation (suntanning) and senile lentigos, commonly share increased SCF/KIT and ET-1/ETBR signaling and reveals their coordinated roles in regulating epidermal melanogenesis as a part of skin homeostasis consistent with a previous study (31Grichnik J.M. Burch J.A. Burchette J. Shea C.R. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1998; 111: 233-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Additionally, Motokawa et al. (32Motokawa T. Kato T. Katagiri T. Suzuki I. J. Dermatol. Sci. 2004; 37: 120-123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) reported that expression of the POMC (pro-opiomelanocortin) gene, which encodes a precursor of α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, is higher in the epidermis of senile lentigines than in peripheral epidermal controls. Recently, Cui et al. (33Cui R. Widlund H.R. Feige E. Lin J.Y. Wilensky D.L. Igras V.E. D'Orazio J. Fung C.Y. Schanbacher C.F. Granter S.R. Fisher D.E. Cell. 2007; 128: 853-864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar) focused on the role of p53, a tumor suppressor protein, in the induction of UV-induced epidermal hyperpigmentation by its direct activation of POMC transcription in keratinocytes, which results in the enhanced melanogenesis of melanocytes in a paracrine manner. They demonstrated multiple instances of in vivo hyperpigmentation due to activation of the p53 cascade, which mimics the pathway of UV-induced pigmentation. Given that p53 can be activated by various diverse stresses, including sun exposure, inflammation, and aging, their findings led us to assess the potential involvement of p53 in melanogenic paracrine cytokine receptor signaling that causes hyperpigmentation disorders, such as senile lentigines, which are strongly related to photoaging and chronological aging. Therefore, we investigated the involvement and the role of p53 in the regulation of melanogenic paracrine cytokine receptor networks in hyperpigmentation of the skin. We report for the first time that p53 plays a pivotal role in the formation of hyperpigmentation via the stimulation of paracrine cytokine networks in human epidermis. Materials—Normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs), melanocytes (NHEMs), and three-dimensional human skin substitutes (HSSs; MEL-300A) were purchased from Kurabo Co. (Osaka, Japan). C57BL/6J female mice 5–7 weeks old were supplied by CLEA Japan, Inc. (Tokyo, Japan). Human recombinant SCF, polyclonal antibodies specific for SCF and KIT, and the ET-1 ELISA kit were provided by Immuno-Biological Laboratories Co. (Gunma, Japan). Human recombinant ET-1 and anti-β-actin-specific antibody were supplied by Sigma. Antibodies specific for p53 (DO-7 and DO-1) and phospho-p53 were purchased from Dako Inc. (Carpinteria, CA), Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), and Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Danvers, MA), respectively. Specific antibodies for p21, MDM2, and Gadd45a were supplied by Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The specific siRNA directed against human or mouse p53 and the control siRNA were provided by Invitrogen. Other chemicals were of reagent grade. Cell Culture—NHEKs were preliminarily incubated in Epi-Life medium (Kurabo) supplemented with 10 μg/ml insulin, 0.1 μg/ml human recombinant epidermal growth factor, 0.5 μg/ml hydrocortisone, 50 μg/ml gentamycin, 50 ng/ml amphotericin B, and 0.4% (v/v) bovine pituitary extract at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% (v/v) CO2. NHEMs were maintained in Medium 254 (Kurabo) supplemented with 5 μg/ml insulin, 5 μg/ml transferrin, 3 ng/ml human recombinant fibroblast growth factor, 0.18 μg/ml hydrocortisone, 3 μg/ml heparin, 10 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, 0.2% (v/v) bovine pituitary extract, and 0.5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum at 37 °C with 5% CO2, as previously described (6Yada Y. Higuchi K. Imokawa G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18352-18357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were seeded in 6-well plates (BD Biosciences) at a density of 1.0 × 105 cells/well and then were incubated for 24 h, followed by incubation in the medium without bovine pituitary extract and human epidermal growth factor for NHEK and in the medium without phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate for NHEM. Following another 24-h incubation, cells were treated with each reagent and incubated according to each experimental design. siRNA Transfection—NHEKs and NHEMs were transfected with 40 nm specific siRNA directed against p53 or a control siRNA, using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) or TransIT-TKO Transfection Reagent (Mirus Bio Co., Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Suction Blister Method—Human epidermal sheets were obtained from the upper arms of five healthy 43–52-year-old Japanese subjects using the suction blister technique (34Furukawa F. Huff J.C. Weston W.L. Norris D.A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1987; 89: 460-463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with approval by the Ethical Committee of Kao Biological Science Laboratories. Following informed consent from the volunteers, samples were collected from each subject at three sites: a hyperpigmented spot in a sun-exposed area (site 1), a sun-irradiated control skin in the peripheral area of site 1 (site 2), and a nonexposed control skin from the ventral side of the upper arm (site 3). Blisters were induced with a 1- or 2.5-mm diameter syringe (Terumo, Tokyo, Japan) at each site for ∼1 to 2 h. The blister roof was removed with sterile scissors. Organ Culture of Human Pigmented Spots—Punch biopsy skins, with or without hyperpigmentation spots on the upper arm or shoulder from healthy 50–59-year-old Caucasian females with Type II skin (Stephens and Associates, Carrollton, TX) were used in this study. Collection of the skins was approved by the Institutional Review Board of IntegReview Ltd. (Austin, TX), and informed consent was obtained from the volunteers prior to the procedure. Each punch biopsy skin with hyperpigmentation was divided into two equal pieces, put onto collagen sponges (MedChem Products Inc., Woburn, MA), and incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium or in a mixture of 50% Epilife, 50% Medium 254 without phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (Cascade Biologics, Portland, OR). One half was then treated with 10 μm PFT for 72 h, and the other half was incubated in medium without PFT. Media were changed every day, and finally the epidermal sheets were peeled off and used for gene expression analysis. Injection of siRNA into Mouse Ears Followed by UVB Irradiation—C57BL/6J female mice, 8 weeks old at the beginning of the study, were used. The animals had free access to food and chlorinated water and were housed in cages. Mouse ears were injected subepidermally with 5 μg of mouse p53-specific siRNA or control siRNA with a cationic polymer transfection reagent, in vivo-jetPEI™ (Polyplus-transfection SA, Illkirch, France). Immediately after the injection, they were irradiated with UVB irradiation with a dose of 50 mJ/cm2 of UVB light, at which dose most of the energy is emitted with a peak of emission near 306 nm, using UVB lamps (Sankyo Denki Co., Kanagawa, Japan). In total, they were administrated with siRNA injection and UVB irradiation three times at 24-h intervals. Measurement of Skin Color—The intensity of UVB-induced pigmentation was measured by a color difference meter (Nippon Denshoku Industries, Tokyo, Japan) 6 days after the first siRNA injection and UVB exposure and was expressed as the L* value. Immunohistochemistry—The specimens, obtained from hyperpigmented (spots) and from peripheral areas, were fixed in 10% buffered formalin and then embedded in paraffin. Following antigen retrieval by heating in a target retrieval solution (10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, including 1 mm EDTA (pH 9.0) or 10 mm sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0)) at 95 °C for 45 min, the sections were treated with 0.3% H2O2 solution at room temperature for 30 min. Immunoreactivity was assessed using antibodies specific for p53 or p53 phosphorylated at serine 392 as primary antibodies and peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG polyclonal antibodies (Dako Inc.) as secondary antibodies after blockage of nonspecific binding using 3% bovine serum albumin and 3% goat normal serum (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Normal rabbit or mouse IgG (Vector Laboratories) in place of the primary antibody was used as a negative control. The sections were developed using the HistoMark® TrueBlue™ peroxidase system (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD), rinsed in distilled water, and counterstained with NUCLEAR FAST RED (Vector Laboratories), followed by washing in running water. Quantitative Real Time RT-PCR—Total RNA extracted from human epidermal sheets and from cultured cells using an RNeasy microkit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), respectively, were used for the single-stranded cDNA synthesis. Real time quantitative RT-PCR was performed with the TaqMan Gene Expression Assay (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), and its on-demand probes for genes of interest were normalized against RPLP0 (ribosomal protein large P0) using an ABI PRISM 7500 Sequence Detector System (Applied Biosystems). Western Blotting Analysis—Whole skin of mouse ears injected with p53-specific siRNA or control siRNA with or without UVB irradiation and cultured cells treated with 5 μm nutlin-3 (EMD Biosciences, Inc., San Diego, CA), 10 μg/ml 5-fluorouracil (5-FU; EMD Biosciences, Inc.), 10 μm pifithrin-α (PFT; EMD Biosciences, Inc.) or 40 nm siRNA specific for p53 together with Lipofectamine 2000 or TransIT-TKO, in the presence or absence of 10 nm SCF and/or 10 nm ET-1, were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, solubilized in 0.1 ml of radioimmune precipitation buffer (Sigma) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and then homogenized using ultrasonication and/or a glass homogenizer. The resulting supernatants were collected and recovered as whole cell lysates, and their protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). The whole cell lysates were separated using 7.5, 10, or 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to Sequi-Blot® polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). The membranes were then incubated with the primary antibodies specific for p53 (DO-7 (1:1000 dilution) or DO-1 (1:400 dilution)), for p53 phosphorylated at serine 15 (1:1000 dilution), for SCF (1:100 dilution), for p21 (1:200 dilution), for MDM2 (1:200 dilution), for Gadd45a (1:200 dilution) for ERK1 and -2 (MAPK) (Thr(P)185/Tyr(P)187) (1:1000 dilution; Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA), for ERK1 and -2 (MAPK) (1:1000; Biomol dilution), for KIT (1:1000 dilution), or for tyrosinase (1.0 μg/ml; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY). The blots were then washed and incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies (anti-mouse IgG peroxidase-linked F(ab′)2 fragment (1:2500 dilution; GE Healthcare) or anti-rabbit IgG peroxidase-linked F(ab′)2 fragment (1:5000 dilution; GE Healthcare)). Immunoreactive protein bands were visualized with ECL Western blotting detection reagents (GE Healthcare). The amounts of protein loaded were normalized against a control protein, β-actin, using a monoclonal antibody specific for β-actin (1:5000 dilution; Sigma) as an internal standard. ELISA—NHEKs were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 1 × 105 to 2 × 105 cells/ml and were treated with 5 μm nutlin-3, 10 μg/ml 5-fluorouracil, or siRNA specific for p53 together with Lipofectamine 2000. The conditioned media were then collected and quantified at 100 μl/well for the levels of ET-1 using an ET-1 ELISA kit (Immuno-Biological Laboratories Co.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The standard curve was linear from 78.1 to 5000 pg/ml. Measurement of Melanin Contents in Three-dimensional HSSs and NHEMs—Three-dimensional HSSs were maintained in EPI-100NMM-113 medium (Kurabo Co.) at 37 °C with 5% CO2, according to the manufacturer's instructions. To investigate the effects of p53 on paracrine cytokine receptor signaling and melanin synthesis, HSSs were incubated with 10 μm PFT in the presence of 10 nm SCF and ET-1 for 14 days. Media were changed every other day. Photographs of HSSs were taken when cells were harvested. Cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, 5% (v/v) trichloroacetic acid, and diethyl ether mixed with three volumes of ethanol. Cells were then washed one time with diethyl ether and incubated at 50 °C for 2 h until dry. Cells were solubilized in 200 μl of 2 m NaOH, and melanin contents were measured using an absorbance meter (Microplate Reader model 550; Bio-Rad) at 405 nm and melanin standard (Sigma). To measure the amount of melanin content in human melanocytes, 5 × 104 NHEMs were cultured in the conditioned medium in 6-well plates and transfected with specific siRNA directed against p53 or a control siRNA. After the transfection, the wells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and cells were solubilized in 200 μl of 2 m NaOH on day 10. Melanin content in NHEMs was measured as described above. Statistics—The level of significance of differences was calculated by Student's t test, paired t test, ANOVA, or Fisher's exact test. A p value of <0.05 is considered statistically significant. The Expression and Phosphorylation of p53 Is Stimulated in Hyperpigmented Skin Accompanied by Significant Increases in the Expression of Paracrine Melanogenic Cytokines—In order to investigate the potential involvement of p53 in the increased expression of paracrine cytokines from keratinocytes, which might result in the formation of hyperpigmentation, mRNA transcripts or protein levels (and phosphorylations) were examined in pigmented spots, which are frequently observed as benign brownish patches on sun-exposed skin (Fig. 1A). Histologically, those tissues were clearly found to contain melanin granules in the basal and spinous layers of the epidermis accompanied by acanthosis (Fig. 1B). Quantitative real time RT-PCR analysis demonstrated significant increases in mRNA transcript levels of well known melanogenic paracrine cytokines (i.e. SCF, ET-1, and POMC, in the pigmented spots compared with peripheral control areas (Fig. 1C), which is consistent with previous studies (26Kadono S.

https://openalex.org/W2064104813,"The pathogenic mechanisms of human autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) have been well known to include the mutational inactivation of PKD2. Although haploinsufficiency and loss of heterozygosity at the Pkd2 locus can cause cyst formation in mice, polycystin-2 is frequently expressed in the renal cyst of human ADPKD, raising the possibility that deregulated activation of PKD2 may be associated with the cystogenesis of human ADPKD. To determine whether increased PKD2 expression is physiologically pathogenic, we generated PKD2-overexpressing transgenic mice. These mice developed typical renal cysts and an increase of proliferation and apoptosis, which are reflective of the human ADPKD phenotype. These manifestations were first observed at six months, and progressed with age. In addition, we found that ERK activation was induced by PKD2 overexpression via B-Raf signaling, providing a possible molecular mechanism of cystogenesis. In PKD2 transgenic mice, B-Raf/MEK/ERK sequential signaling was up-regulated. Additionally, the transgenic human polycystin-2 partially rescues the lethality of Pkd2 knock-out mice and therefore demonstrates that the transgene generated a functional product. Functional strengthening or deregulated activation of PKD2 may be a direct cause of ADPKD. The present study provides evidence for an in vivo role of overexpressed PKD2 in cyst formation.

Mutation screening has shown that a myriad of alterations can occur over the entire region of the PKD2 locus. Indeed, missense, nonsense, frameshift, deletion, and aberrant splicing variations have been described, and these mutations probably result in truncated products and inactivate gene function (8Mochizuki T.

At the cellular level, ADPKD can be explained by a recessive mechanism, leading to the complete loss of function through somatic mutations in the normal PKD2 allele (29Pei Y. Trends Mol. Med. 2001; 7: 151-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The “two-hit” model of cyst formation has been supported by a Pkd2 mutant mouse model (WS25) in which the somatic rearrangement of an unstable allele to a null allele leads to cyst formation (30Wu G. D'Agati V. Cai Y. Markowitz G. Park J.H. Reynolds D.M. Maeda Y. Le T.C. Hou Jr., H. Kucherlapati R. Edelmann W. Somlo S. Cell. 1998; 93: 177-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). However, polycystin-2 is frequently observed in renal cystic epithelium of human ADPKD (31Chang M.Y.

This finding indicates that functional loss or complete deletion of PKD2 is not enough to explain all cases of human ADPKD, and suggests that more studies should be conducted to clarify the effect of PKD2 overexpression in vivo. Recently, overexpression of human PKD2 caused tubular dysfunction and centrosome overduplication (32Burtey S. Riera M. Ribe E. Pennekamp P. Passage E. Rance R. Dworniczak B. Fontes M. Nephrol. Dial. Transplant. 2008; 23: 1157-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 33Burtey S. Riera M. Ribe E. Pennenkamp P. Rance R. Luciani J. Dworniczak B. Mattei M.G. Fontes M. Cell Biol.

To investigate the physiological effects of enhanced PKD2 function in vivo, we generated transgenic mice overexpressing human PKD2. Interestingly, all established mice reproducibly displayed cystic phenotypes closely resembling human ADPKD. The present study provides evidence for an in vivo role of overexpressed PKD2 in cyst formation. This transgenic mouse model should provide new insights into the pathogenic mechanism of human ADPKD. Generation of PKD2 Overexpressing Mice-For the construction of PKD2-overexpressing transgenic mice, a human PKD2 cDNA composed of the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions and full coding sequence of polycystin-2 (gift from Dr. Somlo in Yale University), was subcloned into the pCAGGS plasmid using XbaI and XhoI sites. The human PKD2 transgene was isolated by digesting the construct with PvuI and StuI and standard techniques were used to generate transgenic mice (34Nagao S. Yamaguchi T. Kusaka M. Maser R.L. Takahashi H. Cowley B.D. Grantham J.J. Kidney Int. 2003; 63: 427-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Briefly, the transgene was injected into pronuclei of fertilized eggs of FVB/NJ female mice. The injected eggs were then transferred into the oviducts of pseudo-pregnant ICR mice. Founder mouse screening and routine genotyping were conducted by PCR using genomic DNAs extracted from tails as templates and primer pairs specific for human PKD2 cDNA (5′-TGCTCAGTTGGCATACCTTG-3′ and 5′-CTCCTCAGAGTCATCCAGGC-3′). For Southern blot analyses, genomic DNAs were digested with XbaI and XhoI, resolved on an agarose gel, transferred to a nylon membrane, and hybridized to a 32P-labeled transgene-specific probe. The probe was created by PCR using a primer pair specific for human PKD2 cDNA (forward, 5′-AGACCTGTTTGGCTTTGCTATT-3′ and reverse, 5′-ATCTCAAAGGGAAGGGCCATACTG-3′). The transgene copy number was measured by a real-time PCR as previously described (35Pennekamp P. Karcher C. Fischer A. Schweickert A. Skryabin B. Horst J. Blum M. Dworniczak B. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 938-943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). The primer pairs, which are common and exist on single exon 6 of both human and mouse Pkd2, were used for this analysis: 5′-ATTTCTTCCTGGCAGCCTGT-3′ and 5′-TCACAACATCCAGCAATTCCA-3′. Reverse Transcriptase-PCR-Total RNAs were isolated from kidneys of all transgenic and wild mice using RNeasy mini (Qiagen). The cDNA was generated from total RNA (2 μg) using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Promega). The primer pairs used for analysis were: 5′-AGACCTGTTTGGCTTTGCTATT and 5′-ATCTCAAAGGGAAGGGCCATACTG-3′ for human PKD2 (470 bp); 5′-GCAGCTTCGCAAACAGGTCAT-3′ and 5′-GAAAGTATGCTGAGTTGCTGCCCT-3′ for mouse Pkd2 (419 bp); and 5′-CGGTGCTGAGTATGTCGTGGAG-3′ and 5′-TGTCATCATACTTGGCAGGTTTC-3′ for mouse Gapdh (internal control, 503 bp). PCR products were separated by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. Western Blot Analysis-Renal tissues isolated from sacrificed mice and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were homogenized in lysis buffer (Intron Biotechnology). Protein concentrations were determined by BCA assay (Sigma). Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and proteins were immunoblotted with primary antibodies against the following proteins: polycystin-2 (a gift from Dr. Wu, Vanderbilt University), phosphorylated B-Raf, Raf-1, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), Akt, p38, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK1/2), total MEK, ERK, Akt, p38, JNK1/2 (Cell Signaling), B-Raf, Raf-1 (Santa Cruz), and β-actin (Sigma). Histological and Immunohistochemical Analyses-Tissue samples were fixed in 4% buffered paraformaldehyde (Sigma), and embedded in paraffin. Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for histological examination. The number of cysts in each kidney was documented by scoring a single representative longitudinal section. Histological images were captured using a Nikon Eclipse E400 microscope, and cyst size was measured using Scion Image 1.62. To calculate the sizes of cysts and normal tubules, images were analyzed using the Axiovision 3.1 software (Carl Zeiss). Sections from transgenic and normal kidneys were stained with antibodies specific for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (Sigma), polycystin-2, Tamm-Horsfall protein (Santa Cruz), and pERK (Cell Signaling), and the signals were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Dako) and Nova red (Vector Lab). Counterstaining was carried out with hematoxylin, and coverslips were mounted using aqueous mounting medium (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Lectin studies were performed as previously described (36D'Agati V. Trudel M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1992; 3: 975-983Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TUNEL assay was performed with the In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Chemicon). MEF Culture and Transfection-MEFs were derived from each line of PKD2 transgenic embryos (E13.5). Whole embryos were minced and dispersed in 0.05% trypsin, and were then incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. MEFs were plated in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma), and were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 to 70-80% confluence. MEFs were transfected with B-Raf small interfering RNA (Santa Cruz) using Lipofectamine RNAi MAX according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Invitrogen). B-Raf small interfering RNA was used at a concentration of 10 nm and transfection continued for 48 h. MEFs were treated for 30 min with the MEK inhibitor PD98059 (Calbiochem). For transient transfection, MEFs were subcultured 1 day before and transfected using Effectene (Qiagen). Statistical Analyses-Data were presented as mean ± S.D. and were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). An error probability of less than 5% (p < 0.05) was considered to be significant. Cytogenesis in PKD2 Transgenic Mice-To analyze the physiological consequences of PKD2 overexpression in vivo, we generated transgenic mice that overexpress PKD2 under the control of the chicken β-actin promoter and cytomegalovirus immediate early enhancer (Fig. 1A). Four transgenic mouse lines were established, and the PKD2 transgene copy number was determined by Southern blot analysis (data not shown) and real-time PCR using primer pairs common to both human and mouse Pkd2 orthologues (Fig. 1B). The results showed that transgenic mouse lines carried multiple copies of the transgene. To determine transgene expression reverse transcriptase-PCR was conducted using a primer pair specific for the human orthologue of PKD2. The results showed that significant PKD2 transcript levels were detected in kidneys of all transgenic mouse lines (Fig. 1C). Consistently, expression levels of polycystin-2 were also up-regulated in transgenic kidneys (Fig. 1D). To characterize the physiological effects of PKD2 overexpression, we performed histological analyses. Adult kidneys from all transgenic mouse lines exhibited cyst formation and were affected bilaterally (Table 1). When severely affected, kidneys showed numerous cystic lesions, visible at the surface, and fluid-filled cysts (Fig. 2A). Cysts developed from tubules in the cortical and medullar regions (Fig. 2B), and most were found in the cortical region. In addition, the glomeruli were dilated and the morphology of Bowman capsules was altered (Fig. 2C). These cystic phenotypes were commonly observed in all four transgenic lines. The development of renal cysts in PKD2 transgenic mice was classified into distinct stages based on cellular characteristics during progressive cyst formation (34Nagao S. Yamaguchi T. Kusaka M. Maser R.L. Takahashi H. Cowley B.D. Grantham J.J. Kidney Int. 2003; 63: 427-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). At the early stage, cysts were lined with a single layer of cuboidal cells that were proliferative and hyperplastic (Fig. 2D). At the intermediate stage, most cyst-lining cells were still cuboidal (Fig. 2, E and F), but several cells had transformed to flat cells (Fig. 2F, black arrowhead). At the late stage, cyst-lining cells were completely changed into flat cells (Fig. 2, G and H). Therefore, all PKD2 transgenic mice displayed progressive cystic phenotypes that were variable in location and stage.TABLE 1The numbers and mean sizes of cysts in PKD2 transgenic miceCyst size in a diameter (mean ± S.D., μm)PKD2 transgenic mouse lineAgeTotal mean sizeCyst number (mean size)<200 μm<200 μmMonthsC line (n = 14)6-18130.04 ± 58.2240 (128.37 ± 57.83)4 (250.72 ± 27.98)D line (n = 6)6-18161.87 ± 97.5010 (104.00 ± 31.30)5 (277.60 ± 77.16)E line (n = 5)2-18170.33 ± 84.7012 (134.76 ± 37.61)4 (277.04 ± 102.18)F line (n = 3)7-18257.59 ± 182.594 (151.35 ± 29.62)3 (399.24 ± 214.54) Open table in a new tab To determine whether cyst-lining cells express the PKD2 transgene, we immunohistochemically localized polycystin-2 expression in transgenic kidneys. Consistent with previous reports, prominent polycystin-2 expression was detected in distal tubules of wild-type kidney cells (Fig. 3, A and B). As expected, polycystin-2 was strongly expressed in large cyst-lining cells (Fig. 3, C and D). Therefore, our data indicated that the overexpression of PKD2 is directly involved in renal cyst formation in mice. In human ADPKD patients, cysts arise from multiple tubule segment types (37Wilson P.D. N. Engl. J. Med. 2004; 350: 151-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). However, the cysts of PKD2-mutated animal models frequently originate from specific tubule segments. The origins of cysts were distal tubule segments in Pkd2 knock-out mice and proximal tubules in truncated PKD2 transgenic rats (30Wu G. D'Agati V. Cai Y. Markowitz G. Park J.H. Reynolds D.M. Maeda Y. Le T.C. Hou Jr., H. Kucherlapati R. Edelmann W. Somlo S. Cell. 1998; 93: 177-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 38Gallagher A.R. Hoffmann S. Brown N. Cedzich A.

To investigate the origin of renal cysts, we conducted immunohistochemical analyses using nephron segment-specific lectins including: Lotus tetragonolobus (LTA, proximal tubule), Dolichos biflorus (DBA, collecting tubule), and Tamm-Horsfall protein (THP, distal tubule) (Fig. 4). All of cysts originating from proximal tubules and collecting ducts displayed continuous lectin staining unlike cysts in Pkd2-deficient mouse kidneys (30Wu G. D'Agati V. Cai Y. Markowitz G. Park J.H. Reynolds D.M. Maeda Y. Le T.C. Hou Jr., H. Kucherlapati R. Edelmann W. Somlo S. Cell. 1998; 93: 177-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Large cysts and dilated tubules developed from proximal tubules (Fig. 4, A and B). Small numbers of cysts originated from collecting tubules (Fig. 4, C and D). Cysts from distal tubules were also detected in the transgenic kidney (Fig. 4, E and F). Therefore, cysts in PKD2 transgenic mice developed from a range of segments in kidneys, resembling the clinical features of human ADPKD. Renal cysts first appeared at six months of age in all transgenic lines. Therefore, we examined cystic phenotypes in mice from 6 to 18 months old. Indeed, the cystic phenotype appeared at a relatively late age and correlated with the aging process. Cyst size appeared to increase as transgenic mice aged (6-month-old, 190.27 ± 79.15 μm diameter; 18-month-old, 318.47 ± 129.82 μm) (Fig. 5). The number of cysts greater than 200 μm also increased in aged transgenic mice (6-month old, n = 4; 18-month old, n = 11). These results indicated that the cystic phenotypes of PKD2 transgenic mice are progressive with aging. Deregulation of Apoptosis and Proliferation in Kidneys of PKD2 Transgenic Mice-Because apoptosis and tubular proliferation are prerequisites for cyst formation (39Zhou X.J. Kukes G. Diagn. Mol. Pathol. 1998; 7: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 40Nadasdy T. Laszik Z. Lajoie G. Blick K.E. Wheeler D.E. Silva F.G. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1995; 5: 1462-1468Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we evaluated immunohistochemically these processes in the kidneys of PKD2 transgenic mice (Fig. 6). Most PCNA-positive cells were detected around a cyst and especially at late stage cysts (Fig. 6A). PCNA-positive cell number per tubule was significantly increased in all PKD2 transgenic mice (Fig. 6B). Compared with PCNA-positive cells, apoptotic cells were mainly detected at the intermediate stage (Fig. 6C). In addition, the number of apoptotic cells per tubule increased (Fig. 6D). Coincidentally, the patterns of bromodeoxyuridine incorporation were similar to those of PCNA staining (data not shown). Therefore, both proliferation and apoptosis were involved in cyst formation in PKD2 transgenic mice. ERK, a Downstream Effector of PKD2, Is Activated via B-Raf Signaling in Renal Cyst Formation-Progression of cystogenesis can be delayed in vivo by suppressing ERK activity (41Omori S. Hida M. Fujita H. Takahashi H. Tanimura S. Kohno M. Awazu M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2006; 17: 1604-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), which was reported to be regulated by calcium signaling (42Yamaguchi T. Wallace D.P. Magenheimer B.S. Hempson S.J. Grantham J.J. Calvet J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40419-40430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Polycystin-2 binds to polycystin-1 forming a heterodimer, which is essential for calcium signaling (13Qian F. Germino F.J. Cai Y. Zhang X. Somlo S. Germino G.G. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 14Tsiokas L. Kim E. Arnould T. Sukhatme V.P. Walz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6965-6970Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Therefore, proliferative properties of renal cells may be altered by disrupting calcium regulation through the overexpression of a polycystin-1 C-terminal fragment (42Yamaguchi T. Wallace D.P.

Indeed, levels of phosphorylated ERK are up-regulated in other ADPKD models (32Burtey S. Riera M. Ribe E. Pennekamp P. Passage E. Rance R. Dworniczak B. Fontes M. Nephrol. Dial. Transplant. 2008; 23: 1157-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). It is plausible that PKD2 overexpression may contribute to renal cystogenesis by modulating ERK activity through calcium regulation (42Yamaguchi T. Wallace D.P. Magenheimer B.S. Hempson S.J. Grantham J.J. Calvet J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40419-40430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 43Yamaguchi T. Nagao S. Wallace D.P. Belibi F.A. Cowley B.D.

Soc. Nephrol. 2006; 17: 178-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we confirmed he level of the B-Raf/MEK/ERK sequential signaling pathway using Western blot analysis. Interestingly, phosphorylation of B-Raf/MEK/ERK was activated in PKD2 transgenic mice kidneys but not phosphorylated Raf-1 (Fig. 7A). Fig. 7B shows the quantification data of Fig. 7A. The levels of phosphorylation of Akt/total Akt was higher than in NHK cells compared with ADPKD cells (42Yamaguchi T. Wallace D.P. Magenheimer B.S. Hempson S.J. Grantham J.J. Calvet J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40419-40430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The Akt, upstream of B-Raf, was also down-regulated in PKD2 transgenic mice kidney similar to previous data (Fig. 7C). To confirm the ERK phosphorylation increase by B-Raf signaling, we checked the expression change of phosphorylated ERK that was critical for the development of cyst by B-Raf inhibition using B-Raf small interfering RNA in PKD2 transgenic MEFs. The phosphorylation of ERK was reduced by inhibition of B-Raf and these data were similar to the result of MEK inhibitor treatment (15 μm, PD98058) (Fig. 7D). Finally, we checked activation of other MAPK pathways on the effect on cyst formation. The ERK phosphorylation level was also elevated in PKD2 transgenic mice but the phosphorylation level of p38 MAPK and JNK1/2 were unaffected by PKD2 overexpression (Fig. 7E). We investigated that the phosphorylation status of ERK via B-Raf signaling may be critical for development of cyst in PKD2 transgenic mice. We next examined the status of ERK, as a downstream effector of PKD2 in PKD2 transgenic mice kidney. As shown in Fig. 8A, the phosphorylation of ERK was induced in kidneys of PKD2 transgenic mice relative to wild-type of similar age. Because the inactivation of Pkd2 causes the cystic phenotype in mice (30Wu G. D'Agati V. Cai Y. Markowitz G. Park J.H. Reynolds D.M. Maeda Y. Le T.C. Hou Jr., H. Kucherlapati R. Edelmann W. Somlo S. Cell. 1998; 93: 177-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar), the level of phosphorylated ERK was measured in Pkd2-deficient MEFs (Fig. 8A). Similar to PKD2 transgenic MEFs, the level of phosphorylated ERK was increased in Pkd2-deficient MEFs (Fig. 8A). These results suggest that the activation of ERK may be the common step leading to the induction of ADPKD because of either the deficiency or overexpression of PKD2. To evaluate the phosphorylation of ERK more precisely, we carried out immunohistochemical analysis with cystic tissues of the transgenic kidneys. ERK was phosphorylated in cyst-lining cells and cyst-surrounding tubules in cystic kidneys of PKD2 transgenic mice (Fig. 8, B-D). In addition, to confirm the ERK phosphorylation increase by PKD2 overexpression, we transiently overexpressed exogenous human PKD2 in wild-type MEFs cells from PKD2 transgenic mice. As shown in Fig. 8E, the phosphorylation of ERK was induced by exogenous expression of PKD2, which was consistent with observations from PKD2 transgenic MEFs. This result indicates that ERK activation is induced by PKD2 overexpression and may be associated with renal cyst formation in PKD2 transgenic mice. The PKD2 Transgenic Product Is Functionally Active in Mice-As nullizygosity of Pkd2 results in embryonic lethality (30Wu G. D'Agati V. Cai Y. Markowitz G. Park J.H. Reynolds D.M. Maeda Y. Le T.C.

https://openalex.org/W2085324493,"Peroxiredoxins (Prxs) are highly conserved proteins found in most organisms, where they function primarily to scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS). Loss of the most ubiquitous member of the family, Prx1, is associated with the accumulation of oxidatively damaged DNA and a tumor-prone phenotype. Prx1 interacts with the transcriptional regulatory domain of the c-Myc oncoprotein and suppresses its transforming activity. The DNA damage in tissues of prx1-/- mice is associated in some cases with only modest increases in total ROS levels. However, these cells show dramatic increases in nuclear ROS and reduced levels of cytoplasmic ROS, which explains their mutational susceptibility. In the current work, we have investigated whether changes in other ROS scavengers might account for the observed ROS redistribution pattern in prx1-/- cells. We show approximately 5-fold increases in Prx5 levels in prx1-/- embryo fibroblasts relative to prx1+/+ cells. Moreover, Prx5 levels normalize when Prx1 expression is restored. Prx5 levels also appear to be highly dependent on c-Myc, and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments showed differential occupancy of c-Myc and Prx1 complexes at E-box elements in the prx5 gene proximal promoter. This study represents a heretofore unreported mechanism for the c-Myc-dependent regulation of one Prx family member by another and identifies a novel means by which cells reestablish ROS homeostasis when one of these family members is compromised."
https://openalex.org/W1978911562,"Salivary glands express multiple isoforms of P2X and P2Y nucleotide receptors, but their in vivo physiological roles are unclear. P2 receptor agonists induced salivation in an ex vivo submandibular gland preparation. The nucleotide selectivity sequence of the secretion response was BzATP >> ATP > ADP >> UTP, and removal of external Ca(2+) dramatically suppressed the initial ATP-induced fluid secretion ( approximately 85%). Together, these results suggested that P2X receptors are the major purinergic receptor subfamily involved in the fluid secretion process. Mice with targeted disruption of the P2X(7) gene were used to evaluate the role of the P2X(7) receptor in nucleotide-evoked fluid secretion. P2X(7) receptor protein and BzATP-activated inward cation currents were absent, and importantly, purinergic receptor agonist-stimulated salivation was suppressed by more than 70% in submandibular glands from P2X(7)-null mice. Consistent with these observations, the ATP-induced increases in [Ca(2+)](i) were nearly abolished in P2X(7)(-/-) submandibular acinar and duct cells. ATP appeared to also act through the P2X(7) receptor to inhibit muscarinic-induced fluid secretion. These results demonstrate that the ATP-sensitive P2X(7) receptor regulates fluid secretion in the mouse submandibular gland."

The cell wall of fungal organisms is a dynamic structure, providing protection against hostile environments, yet also harboring many hydrolytic and toxic molecules required for the fungus to invade its ecological niche (1Latge J.P. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 66: 279-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Polysaccharides account for over 90% of the cell wall. The central skeletal component of the cell wall common to the vast majority of fungal species is a branched core of β(1,3) glucan, linked to chitin via a β(1,4) linkage (1Latge J.P. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 66: 279-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Interchain β(1,6) glucosidic linkages account for 3 and 4% of the total glucan linkages in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Aspergillus fumigatus, respectively (2Fleet G.H. Rose A.H. The Yeasts.

This core is embedded in a complex of amorphous proteins and/or polysaccharide whose composition is highly species-dependent. The core β(1,3) glucan is subjected to continuous synthetic elaboration, degradation, and remodeling by a large arsenal of enzymes, whose activities must be appropriately balanced to provide the cell wall with adequate elasticity to allow growth, budding, or branching and yet sufficient strength to guard against cell lysis (1Latge J.P. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 66: 279-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Glucan synthase is a protein complex located at the plasma membrane, synthesizing β(1,3) glucan from UDP-glucose (65–90% of the total glucan). In cell wall remodeling, glycoside hydrolases and glycosyltransferases/transglycosylases play a crucial role (1Latge J.P. Mol.

Pure glycoside hydrolases degrade glycans mainly to regulate the plasticity of the cell wall under different circumstances, such as cell division, cell separation, and sporulation (5Adams D.J. Microbiology. 2004; 150: 2029-2035Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), whereas glycoside hydrolases with significant transglycosylase activity are capable of forming new glycosidic bonds between oligosaccharides, generating longer or branched polymers.

This transferase reaction generates a new β(1,3) linkage, resulting in the elongation of β(1,3) glucan chains, offering a mechanism for the synthesis of longer glucan chains as alternative to, or in synergy with, glucan synthase. The Gas/Gel proteins consist of a signal sequence, a catalytic core, and either a cysteine-rich domain (classified as a carbohydrate-binding module, CBM43) (11Coutinho P.M. Henrissat B. Gilbert H.J. Davies G. Henrissat B. Svensson B. Recent Advances in Carbohydrate Bioengineering. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1999: 3-12Google Scholar) or a Ser-Thr-rich motif, followed by a GPI anchor (Fig. 1A). Based on the presence or absence of the C-terminal cysteine-rich domain, the family is subdivided into GH72+ (with a CBM43 domain) and GH72– (without a CBM43 domain) (14Ragni E. Fontaine T. Gissi C. Latge J.P. Popolo L. Yeast. 2007; 24: 297-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The genome of S. cerevisiae contains five proteins (Gas1–Gas5), two of which (Gas1 and Gas2) belong to the GH72+ subfamily. With the exception of Gas3, transglycosylase activity has been reported for all these enzyme (14Ragni E. Fontaine T. Gissi C. Latge J.P. Popolo L.

A. fumigatus contains seven genes (gel1–gel7), with only Gel1p, Gel2p (both GH72–), and Gel4p (GH72+) being expressed during mycelial growth in rich media (12Mouyna I. Morelle W. Vai M. Monod M.

In Candida albicans five GH72 enzymes, PHR1–3 (known as pH-regulated enzymes) and PGA4–5, have been detected. PHR1, PHR2, and PGA5 belong to GH72+, whereas PHR3 and PGA4 belong to the GH72– subfamily. It was shown that all these proteins, irrespectively of the presence/absence of a CBM43 domain, display the same glycosyltransferase activity (14Ragni E. Fontaine T. Gissi C. Latge J.P. Popolo L. Yeast. 2007; 24: 297-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The essential function of these enzymes in fungal morphogenesis has been shown by gene disruption studies in a number of organisms. For instance, a gene knock-out of Scgas1 led to aberrant cell morphology, reduced growth rate, cell aggregation, and different cell wall composition (16Popolo L. Vai M. Gatti E. Porello S. Bonfante P. Balestrini R. Alberghina L. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1879-1885Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Ram A.F. Kapteyn J.C. Montijn R.C. Caro L.H. Douwes J.E. Baginsky W.

A double knock-out of Scgas2 and Scgas4 showed a severe reduction in the efficiency of sporulation, an increased permeability of the spores to exogenous substances, and production of unviable spores (15Ragni E.

Single and double knockouts of Afge12 and double knockouts of Afge11/Afge12 resulted in slower growth, abnormal conidiogenesis, and an altered cell wall composition (12Mouyna I. Morelle W. Vai M.

Caphr1 and Caphr2 single knock-outs show defects in growth and morphogenesis, reduction in β(1,3) glucan-associated β(1,6) glucans, and a 5-fold increase in the chitin content of the walls (18Saporito-Irwin S.M.

Despite considerable interest in the molecular mechanisms of these transglycosylases, it is currently not understood what structure these enzymes adopt, how they interact with the substrate, what mechanism they adopt for the initial nucleophilic attack, and crucially, how they are able to drive the reaction toward transglycosylation and not hydrolysis in the presence of a high concentration of a more available nucleophile, water. Here we present the first crystal structure of a GH72+ glucanosyltransferase enzyme, ScGas2, in complex with laminaripentaose and a complex with the hydrolysis products of laminariheptaose. The crystal structure reveals a (βα)8 catalytic core, tightly interacting with the C-terminal CBM43 glucan binding domain. The active site is located in an unusual tyrosine-rich groove, possessing two glutamic acids as catalytic residues. Site-directed mutagenesis data together with crystal structures of the ScGas2-oligosaccharide complexes shows that product binding in the acceptor site is crucial for tuning the balance between hydrolysis and transglycosylation. Cloning, Expression, and Purification-The DNA sequence encoding amino acid residues 26–525 of the S. cerevisiae ScGas2 (Swiss-Prot, locus ScGas2_YEAST; Swiss-Prot accession number Q06135; GeneID, 851056), defined as scgas2, was obtained by PCR from S. cerevisiae strain W303 genomic DNA, using the forward primer, 5′-ATCTCGAGAAAAGAGAGGCTGAAGCTTCAGGTGTCAGCTTTGAAAAAACCCCTG, containing a recognition sequence for XhoI (underlined) and a KEX2 cleavage signal (italic), and the reverse primer, 5′-GCTCTAGACTAACTCGATGGGTACTTTACGTTCAAACTTTCC-3′, containing a recognition sequence for XbaI (underlined), and cloned into the pSC-B vector (Stratagene). Following digestion with XhoI and XbaI, the cloned sequence was subcloned into the Pichia pastoris protein expression and secretion vector pPICZαA (Invitrogen), resulting in the expression plasmid pPICZαAscgas2 (Ser26–Ser525). Subsequently, the codons for the asparagine residues at positions 498 and 510 in ScGas2 were simultaneously changed by site-directed mutagenesis to aspartic acid codons (removing N-linked glycosylation sites) using the forward primer, 5′-GAATGTTTTTGATTCTATAAGGGATATCACATACAATCATGGCGATTATTC-3′, and the reverse primer, 5′-CTTTCCTTGCTACGCGATGGATCTGATTTTGAATAATCGCCATG-3′. The resulting plasmid, pPICZαAgas2 (Ser26–Ser525) N498D/N510D, referred to here as the wild type, was used as template for introducing the following single amino acid changes by site-directed mutagenesis as follows: Q62A, Y107F, Y107Q, D132N, N175A, E176Q, Y244F, Y244Q, E275Q, Y307Q, F404A, and Y474A, such that each of the resulting 12 plasmids carried the indicated mutation in addition to the previously introduced asparagine to aspartic acid mutations at positions 498 and 510. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out following the QuikChange protocol (Stratagene), using the KOD HotStart DNA polymerase (Novagene). All plasmids were verified by sequencing (DNA Sequencing Service, College of Life Sciences, University of Dundee, Scotland, UK). All plasmids were isolated from Escherichia coli strain DH5α, linearized with PmeI, and used to transform P. pastoris strain into X-33 following the LiCl method (Invitrogen) or using the Pichia EasyComp™ transformation kit (Invitrogen). Transformants were selected on YPD plates (1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v) peptone, 2% (w/v) dextrose) containing 100 μg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen). Batch cultures were performed in a 100-ml volume of BMGY medium (1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v) peptone, 100 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.0), 1.34% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base, and 1% (v/v) glycerol). 50 ml were used to grow 500 ml of BMGY medium overnight at 30 °C, and expression was induced by methanol (1%, v/v) for 72 h at room temperature in a shaking incubator (270 rpm). Yeast cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3480 × g for 30 min. The supernatants containing soluble ScGas2 were filtered to 0.2 μm, concentrated to 50 ml using a Vivaflow 200 cassette (10,000 Mr weight cutoff, PES membrane; Vivascience), and dialyzed against water. The samples were then loaded onto a 2 × 5-ml HiTrap Q FF column (Amersham Biosciences) that had been equilibrated with 10 column volumes of 25 mm Tris, pH 7.0, on an AKTA purifier system. Following loading, the column was washed with 10 column volumes of 25 mm Tris, pH 7.0. The protein was eluted with a salt gradient (0–500 mm NaCl) over 20 column volumes, collecting 2-ml fractions. The fractions containing the proteins were then pooled and concentrated to 5 ml using Vivaspin 10,000 Mr weight cutoff. Subsequently, gel filtration was carried out using a Superdex 75 XK26/60 column in 25 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.0. The concentrated ScGas2 proteins were used for both kinetic analysis and crystallization trials. Enzymology-To test for β(1,3) glucanosyltransferase/hydrolase activity, the purified proteins (10 μg) were incubated with the linear reduced laminarioligosaccharides rG5, rG7, and rG19 at a concentration of 4 mm in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, at 37 °C. Aliquots of 2.5 μl were withdrawn at different times (0, 1, and 3 h and overnight), supplemented with 47.5 μl of 50 mm NaOH, and then analyzed by high performance anion-exchange chromatography through a CarboPAC-PA1 column (Dionex 4.6 mm inner diameter × 250 mm), as described by Hartland et al. (21Hartland R.P. Fontaine T. Debeaupuis J.P. Simenel C. Delepierre M. Latge J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26843-26849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Crystallization and Data Collection-ScGas2 was spin-concentrated to 21 mg/ml. Crystals were grown by sitting drop experiments at 20 °C through mixing 1 μl of protein with an equal volume of a reservoir solution (20% 1,4-butanediol, 5% acetone, 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 4.5). Under these conditions, crystals appeared within 3–7 days. They were cryoprotected with 0.1 m sodium acetate, 30% 1,4 butanediol, 5% acetone, pH 4.5, and flash-cooled prior to data collection at 100 K. (NH4)3IrCl6 derivative, as well as oligosaccharide complexes, were generated by soaking apo-crystals in cryoprotectant supplemented with heavy atom salt (10–100 mm), laminaripentaose (200 mm), or laminariheptaose (100 mm), respectively, for 10–20 min prior to data collection. Data for heavy atom derivative was collected at beamline ID23-2 (ESRF, Grenoble, France), all other data were collected in-house on a Rigaku RU-200 rotating anode with an R-AXIS IV detector. All data were processed and scaled using the HKL suite (22Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

By SIRAS, using data from a crystal soaked with (NH4)3IrCl6 as well as a data set on a crystal of the E176Q mutant (Table 1), an initial model for the apo-structure was generated with ARP/warp (25Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2561) Google Scholar) (initially building 412 residues of the single protein monomer in the asymmetric unit) and improved through cycles of manual model building in Coot (26Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (22534) Google Scholar) and refinement with REFMAC5 (27Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13712) Google Scholar). Molecular replacement with this structure as a search model was used to generate phases and starting models for the remaining data sets, which were refined similarly. Topologies for the oligosaccharide ligands were generated with PRODRG (28Schuttelkopf A.W. van Aalten D.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 1355-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (4063) Google Scholar). The final models were validated with PROCHECK (29Laskowski R.A. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 1049-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar) and WHATCHECK (30Hooft R.W. Vriend G. Sander C. Abola E.E. Nature. 1996; 381: 272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1788) Google Scholar), and model statistics are given in Table 1. Coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank. The structure has several disordered regions as follows: one in the poorly conserved loop between β3 and α1, one covering a short stretch of the interdomain region between α9 and α10, and one (absent in three of the present four structures) preceding α11. In addition, the C terminus of ScGas2 (from at least Ser507, but in some cases as early as Leu483) is completely disordered. Although density for the α13 helix could be observed in all three structures, its quality was too poor for it to be modeled in the oligosaccharide complexes (Fig. 1B). Structure of ScGas2 Reveals a Two-domain Fold-A truncated form of ScGas2 (amino acids 26–525, excluding the signal/GPI-anchor sequences, Fig. 1A) was expressed as a secreted protein in P. pastoris and purified by ion-exchange and gel filtration chromatography. The structure of ScGas2 was solved by SIRAS with an iridium derivative, complexes with laminarioligosaccharides and a structure of a E176Q mutant were solved by molecular replacement, and all structures were refined to 1.6–2.1 Å with Rfree <0.22 (Table 1). The structure of ScGas2 is composed of two interacting domains as follows, a (βα)8 catalytic domain, abundantly found in other carbohydrate active enzymes; and a C-terminal cysteine-rich domain of the CBM43 family (11Coutinho P.M. Henrissat B. Gilbert H.J. Davies G. Henrissat B. Svensson B. Recent Advances in Carbohydrate Bioengineering. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1999: 3-12Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The (β/α)8 domain deviates from the canonical topology by kinks in the sixth and seventh α-helix (α6/α6′ and α7/α7′, Fig. 1A). Similar to many other (β/α)8 barrel proteins, the first strand of the barrel (β3) is preceded by a two-stranded antiparallel β-sheet, which seals the “bottom” of the barrel. A second short two-stranded sheet (β11/β12) is inserted into the last βα loop (31Wierenga R.K. FEBS Lett. 2001; 492: 193-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), placing it on the opposite side of the barrel and within 20 Å of the active site (Fig. 1). Not surprisingly, a DALI (32Holm L. Sander C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 478-480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar) search with the ScGas2 catalytic domain yields over 300 proteins with significant structural similarity; among the most similar structures are numerous glucosidases. The two crystal structures with the highest Z scores are domain 3 from human β-glucuronidase (PDB ID 1BHG (33Jain S. Drendel W.B. Chen Z.W. Mathews F.S. Sly W.S. Grubb J.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar)) and Cellvibrio mixtus mannosidase 5A (PDB ID 1UUQ (34Dias F.M. Vincent F. Pell G. Prates J.A. Centeno M.S. Tailford L.E. Ferreira L.M. Fontes C.M. Davies G.J. Gilbert H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25517-25526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar)), which superimpose with r.m.s.d. of 2.7 Å and 3.0 Å for ≈260 C-α atoms, respectively. The ScGas2 catalytic domain contains three disulfide bridges, one between Cys89 and Cys118 connecting α1 and α2, and another between Cys231 from the fifth αβ loop and Cys367 from the interdomain loop. It is noteworthy that both these disulfides occur in the vicinity of disordered loops, and it is possible that they help to limit flexibility. The third disulfide of the catalytic domain is formed by Cys247 and Cys278 from the sixth and seventh βα loop (preceding α6 and α8, respectively). Both these loops are involved in forming the acceptor saccharide-binding site, and it is possible that the disulfide bridge helps to correctly position them. When a sequence alignment of GH72 enzymes (Fig. 1A) is interpreted in the context of the ScGas2 structure (Fig. 1B), it is clear that most of the sequence conservation locates to the catalytic core, whereas the C-terminal cysteinerich CBM43 domain of ScGas2 is less conserved. In particular the active site of ScGas2 is highly conserved (Fig. 1B), from the –2 to the +2 site, suggesting that ScGas2 may be a good representative of the GH72 family for further mechanistic studies. CBM43 Domain Contains a Conserved Cysteine Structure and Exposed Aromatic Residues-Based on its sequence, the C-terminal domain of ScGas2 (Fig. 1) has been assigned to the CBM43 family of carbohydrate-binding modules (11Coutinho P.M. Henrissat B. Gilbert H.J. Davies G. Henrissat B. Svensson B. Recent Advances in Carbohydrate Bioengineering. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1999: 3-12Google Scholar). It assumes a predominantly α-helical structure; a core formed by four α-helixes is augmented by two small antiparallel two-stranded β-sheets (Fig. 1C). Although the amino acid sequence of the catalytic domain is reasonably well conserved among GH72 family members (32–61% identity), there is considerably more variation in the C-terminal domain, where, even among GH72+ subfamily members, sequence identity can drop below 20% (Fig. 1A). The few amino acids that are completely conserved include a number of hydrophobic residues and eight cysteines, which, in the ScGas2 structure, form four disulfide bridges (Cys390–Cys442; Cys399–Cys466; Cys419–Cys424; and Cys457–Cys489, Fig. 1, A–C), in agreement with a recent mass spectrometry-based assignment (35Popolo L. Ragni E. Carotti C. Palomares O. Aardema R. Back J.W. Dekker H.L. de Koning L.J. de Jong L. de Koster C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 18553-18565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The C-terminal ≈40 residues of the expressed protein, which in the full-length protein would lead up to the GPI anchor, are (mostly) disordered in our structures; it is likely that the poorly conserved stretch between α15 and the GPI anchor site functions as a flexible tether. Structural homology searches of this domain with DALI (32Holm L. Sander C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 478-480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar) yielded no significant hits. As CBM43 domains are most commonly associated with β(1,3) glucan-processing domains from CAZy families GH17/72, it is possible that they would possess β(1,3) glucan binding activity. It has been shown that carbohydrate binding to CBM domains is generally effected by surface-exposed tyrosine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine residues (36Boraston A.B. Bolam D.N. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 769-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (1473) Google Scholar). The ScGas2 cysteine-rich domain contains six such surface aromatic amino acids: Phe404, Tyr417, Tyr474, Phe493, Tyr501, and Tyr506 (Fig. 1C), which could play a role binding to β(1,3) glucan, although none of them are conserved between different GH72+ family members (Fig. 1A). To test this hypothesis, Phe404 and Tyr474 were mutated to alanines. Only the F404A mutant showed a small difference in transglycosylation/hydrolysis activity of a G19 laminarioligosaccharide compared with the wild type enzyme (Table 2). Earlier studies also showed that the presence or absence of the CBM43 domain in the GH72 enzymes does not appear to significantly affect transglycosylation activity (13Mouyna I. Monod M. Fontaine T. Henrissat B. Lechenne B. Latge J.P. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 741-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 14Ragni E. Fontaine T. Gissi C. Latge J.P. Popolo L.

Furanocoumarins are natural plant metabolites characterized by a furane moiety fused to benzopyran-2-one. The position of the furane substitution distinguishes two large groups of compounds, the linear (psoralens) and the angular furanocoumarins (angelicin and derivatives) (Fig. 1) (1Murray R.D.H. Mendéz J. Brown S.A. The Natural Coumarins. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1982Google Scholar, 2Murray R.D.H. Prog. Chem. Org. Nat. Prod. 2002; 83: 1-619Google Scholar). The psoralens in particular are known for their photosensitizing and phototoxic effects and have been used in photochemotherapy of skin disorders (psoriasis, vitiligo, and mycosis). In addition, numerous other bioactivities have been attributed to furanocoumarins, which are the focus of many pharmacological screenings, although their mutagenic potential was recognized many years ago (3Kawase M.

Sankaranarayanan A. Raman G. Ansari A.A. Exp. Biol. Med. 2007; 232: 1338-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Furanocoumarins are formed by only four plant families (i.e. Apiaceae, Rutaceae, Fabaceae, and Moraceae) (5Bourgaud F. Allard N. Guckert A. Forlot P. Natural Sources of Fucocoumarins.

Their toxicity is based on their ability to create covalent adducts of double-stranded DNA, impeding DNA replication (9Ojala T. Remes S. Haansuu P. Vuorela H. Hiltunen R. Haahtela K. Vuorela P. J.

Phys. 1993; 106: 111-118Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that plants synthesize either linear furanocoumarins (psoralens) only or both linear and angular furanocoumarins, which are less widely distributed and mainly confined to some Fabaceae and Apiaceae. The association of both forms was demonstrated to be more toxic for insect larvae than the presence of linear furanocoumarins alone, which could reflect the evolutionary adaptation of plants to new herbivores that have acquired the capacity to detoxify psoralens (15Berenbaum M.R. Zangerl A.R. Recent Adv. Phytochem. 1996; 30: 1-24Google Scholar, 16Ma R. Cohen M.B. Berenbaum M.R. Schuler M.A. Arch. Biochem.

Due to the complex bioactivity of furanocoumarins, its biosynthesis has received continuous attention. The basis of linear furanocoumarin formation was mostly established by the end of the 1980s by a combination of precursor feeding experiments and the biochemical characterization of major enzymes of the pathway. Nevertheless, until recently, the pathway was thought to depend on the ortho-hydroxylation of trans-or cis-4-coumaric acid and cyclization of the product to umbelliferone (see Ref. 6Bourgaud F. Hehn A. Larbat R. Doerper S. Gontier E. Kellner Matern U. Phytochem. Rev. 2006; 5: 293-308Crossref Scopus (250) Google Scholar for a review). However, a dioxygenase has now been cloned from Arabidopsis and expressed; this enzyme converts feruloyl-CoA to 2,4-dihydroxy-5-methoxycinnamoyl-CoA and scopoletin (18Kai K. Mizutani M. Kawamura N. Yamamoto R. Tamai M. Yamaguchi H. Sakata K. Shimizu B. Plant J. 2008; 55: 989-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). To a lesser extent, it also accepts 4-coumaroyl-CoA, which yields umbelliferone (Fig. 1). The data prove for the first time the essential role of CoA-esters. These serve as an active substrate in coumarin biosynthesis, whereas unconjugated cinnamic acids are inactive. This pivotal role of CoA-esters in coumarin synthesis is consistent with the report of a unique 4-coumaroyl-CoA ligase that was specifically assigned to coumarin synthesis in Ruta graveolens (19Endler A. Martens S. Wellmann F. Matern U. Plant Mol. Biol. 2008; 67: 335-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Umbelliferone is subsequently prenylated to demethylsuberosin by a 6-prenyl-transferase also assigned to plastids in R. graveolens (20Dhillon D.S. Brown S.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 177: 74-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The conversion of demethylsuberosin to marmesin and further to psoralen is then catalyzed by two distinct P450 enzymes (i.e. marmesin synthase and psoralen synthase) in Ammi majus and Petroselinum crispum (21Hamerski D. Matern U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 22Wendorff H. Matern U. Eur. J.

Psoralen is next hydroxylated at C-5 by yet another P450 monooxygenase-generating bergaptol, which is subsequently O-methylated to bergapten (5-methoxypsoralen) (24Hamerski D. Matern U. FEBS Lett. 1988; 239: 263-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 25Hehmann M. Lukacin R. Ekiert H. Matern U. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 932-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the formation of xanthotoxin (8-methoxypsoralen) from psoralen is supposed to proceed via analogous reactions (i.e. successive hydroxylation at C-8 and O-methylation), but this remains to be established. The pathway to angular furanocoumarins has not been as well documented, especially at the level of enzyme activity. This pathway branches off from that for psoralens by divergent prenylation of umbelliferone (Fig. 1) to form osthenol. The two subsequent steps leading to angelicin were assumed to be very similar to the steps leading to the conversion of demethylsuberosin to (+)-marmesin and psoralen. This assumption is particularly convincing when the catalytic mechanisms of psoralen synthase and angelicin synthase are compared. Previous studies using stereospecifically deuterated (+)-marmesin confirmed that psoralen synthase activity catalyzes a single concerted reaction, initiated by the abstraction of the C-3′-hydrogen syn-configured to the isopropyloxy group and release of acetone as a by-product (Fig. 1) (26Stanjek V. Piel J. Boland W. Phytochemistry. 1999; 50: 1141-1145Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 27Stanjek V. Miksch M. Lüer P. Matern U. Boland W. Angew. Chemie-Int. Ed. 1999; 38: 400-402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An equivalent study demonstrated by feeding leaves of Heracleum mantegazzianum with stereospecifically 3′-deuterated (+)-columbianetin that the conversion of (+)-columbianetin to angelicin (i.e. angelicin synthase activity) also proceeded by a syn-elimination at C-3′ (28Stanjek V. Boland W. Helv. Chim. Acta. 1998; 81: 1596-1607Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar), although this was inferred by mass spectral analysis of metabolites rather than by in vitro enzyme assays. The mechanistic and stereochemical similarities of the two pathways and the limited distribution of angular furanocoumarins to a few plant species that already synthesize linear structures support the assumption that the two pathways are driven by structurally related enzymes. The molecular genetics of furanocoumarin formation has remained elusive, due to the high lability of the specific activities in crude plant microsomal preparations (21Hamerski D. Matern U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), until the very recent isolation of the first furanocoumarin-committed P450 gene, CYP71AJ1, which encodes psoralen synthase. This gene was cloned from A. majus (Apiaceae), which produces only linear furanocoumarins (23Larbat R. Kellner S. Specker S. Hehn A. Gontier E. Hans J. Bourgaud F. Matern U. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 542-554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Notably, the recombinant enzyme efficiently catalyzes the conversion of (+)-marmesin to psoralen but is unable to metabolize the angular substrate (+)-columbianetin, although the angular compound acts as a competitive inhibitor of psoralen synthase activity. Modeling studies and docking calculations suggested that (+)-columbianetin fitted properly into the catalytic pocket, as required for competitive inhibition, but the distance of C-3′ to the active site porphyrin-iron was too large to initiate the process of abstracting hydrogen (23Larbat R. Kellner S. Specker S. Hehn A. Gontier E. Hans J. Bourgaud F. Matern U. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 542-554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The in silico results raised the possibility that in plants producing both linear and angular furanocoumarins, a rather limited number of mutations in CYP71AJ1 paralogs could have generated angelicin synthase; this would have been as a pivotal step in the evolution of the angular furanocoumarin pathway, provided that umbelliferone 8-prenyltransferase for the synthesis of osthenol was also present. In the present work, we describe the cloning and functional expression of two new orthologs of A. majus CYP71AJ1, encoding psoralen synthase, from Apium graveolens (celery CYP71AJ2) and Pastinaca sativa (parsnip CYP71AJ3). Additionally, the closely related CYP71AJ4 was isolated from parsnip and annotated as angelicin synthase, the first P450 gene committed to angular furanocoumarin biosynthesis. Alignments of the paralogs (CYP71AJ3 and CYP71AJ4) revealed that the sequence identity dropped to only 40% in substrate recognition sites (SRSs) 3The abbreviations used are: SRS, substrate recognition site; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; SPE, solid phase extraction; syn-[3′-D]columbianetin, 3′-deuterated (+)-columbianetin.3The abbreviations used are: SRS, substrate recognition site; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; SPE, solid phase extraction; syn-[3′-D]columbianetin, 3′-deuterated (+)-columbianetin. at an overall identity of 70%. Assays conducted with the recombinant enzyme and syn-[3′-D]columbianetin demonstrated a reaction mechanism analogous to that of psoralen synthase initiated by the abstraction of syn-C-3′-hydrogen. These results demonstrate that the CYP71AJ subfamily is involved in the synthesis of both linear and angular furanocoumarins and suggest that CYP71AJ3 and CYP71AJ4 derived from a common ancestor gene. Plant Material—Parsnip (Pastinaca sativa) plants var. “Demi-Long de Guernesey” (Caillard, Avignon, France) were grown in the university greenhouse for 5 weeks. Celery (A. graveolens) plants were bought at a local market. Chemicals—Umbelliferone, psoralen, xanthotoxin, and cinnamic acids were purchased from Sigma. Xantothoxol was from Roth (Karlsruhe, Germany). Angelicin, bergapten, and bergaptol were from Extrasynthese (Genay, France). Demethylsuberosin was synthesized as described previously (21Hamerski D. Matern U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). (+)Marmesin and 5-hydroxymarmesin were kindly provided by R. Caniato (University of Padua, Italy). A small sample of syn-[3′-D]columbianetin and columbianadin were gifts from W. Boland (Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology, Jena, Germany) and J. Hohmann (University of Szeged, Hungary), respectively. (+)-Columbianetin was preparatively isolated from dried roots of Angelica pubescens. The roots (Huisong Pharmaceuticals, Hangzhou, China) obtained from Chongde Sun (Zheijang University, Hangzhou, China) were coarsely chopped, redried in an oven at 80 °C for ∼5 h, and then ground to a fine powder by mill and mortar. The powder (30-g aliquot) was stirred for 60 min in acetone (100 ml) at room temperature, the acetone extract was evaporated to dryness, and the oily residue was partitioned in a mixture of n-hexane/methanol/water 10:1:9 to remove lipids. The polar phase was reduced by evaporation to remove methanol, and the remaining aqueous phase was extracted with ethyl acetate, yielding the organic crude extract. This extract was applied to a silica gel 60 (Merck) column (3 × 35 cm), and the elution was performed in two steps, with chloroform (250 ml) followed by chloroform/acetone 9:1 (500 ml). After the first 200 ml, fractions of 10 ml each were collected and examined by silica F254 thin layer chromatography (Merck) using toluene/acetic acid 4:1 as the mobile phase. Fractions containing blue-fluorescing compounds under UV254 irradiation and co-migrating on TLC with authentic columbianetin (Rf ∼0.3–0.4) were pooled, evaporated to dryness, and subjected to high speed countercurrent chromatography on an HSCCC instrument (P.C. Inc.) equipped with a 400-ml Teflon coil and 10-ml sample loop switch. Solvents were delivered to the coil, the flow was maintained by an L6000 pump (Merck-Hitachi), and fractions were collected manually. The partition coefficients and purity of fractions were determined on an HPLC system (Merck-Hitachi) consisting of a D6000 interface, L6200A gradient pump, AS4000 autosampler, and L4500 diode array detector. Samples were analyzed on an EC 125/4 Nucleodur Sphinx RP column (Machery-Nagel, Düren, Germany) operated at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The two-solvent system employed for separation was composed of 1.5% (v/v) aqueous phosphoric acid (solvent A) and 80% (v/v) acetonitrile (MeCN) in water (solvent B) and using linear gradients of 80 to 50% A in B within 20 min, followed by 50 to 20% A in B over 20–25 min before a final re-equilibration to the starting conditions. The elution was monitored at 330 nm. Solvents chosen for HSCCC separation were mixed at appropriate ratios in a separation funnel, shaken vigorously, and allowed to stand overnight for complete phase separation. The HSCCC coil was then equilibrated with the stationary phase, and the sample was dissolved in 10 ml of the mobile phase and injected into the coil for separation at 890–900 rpm at room temperature and a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions of 2–10 ml were collected, fluorescent substances were detected in small aliquots spotted on filter paper under UV irradiation, and fractions of interest were examined further by TLC and HPLC analyses. The substance identity was finally verified by negative mode mass spectral fragmentation on a VG Micromass 7070 mass spectrometer at 70 eV ionization energy and comparison with authentic (+)-[3′-D]columbianetin (G. Laufenberg and N. Zitzer, Institute of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Philipps-University Marburg). Columbianetin-containing fractions were pooled and concentrated to remove methanol; the remaining aqueous phase was extracted with ethyl acetate and dried. cDNA Cloning—Total RNA was extracted from leaves of 6-h mechanically wounded celery and parsnip with the RNeasy plant extraction kit (Qiagen). The cDNA was generated using SuperScript™ III RT (Invitrogen) and random primers. A full-length cDNA sequence from celery and two full-length cDNA sequences from parsnip were PCR-amplified using CYP71AJ1 (accession number AY532373.1) specific primers (forward, 5′-CGGTACCATGAAGATGCTGGAACAGAAT; reverse, 5′-GGAATTCTCAAACATGTGGTCTGGCAACCACCAAGAGAGG) and proofreading polymerase FideliTaq (GE Healthcare). The PCR amplification included a touch-down (A) and a classical (B) PCR as follows: 5 min at 94 °C, followed by 10 cycles (30 s at 94 °C, 45 s at 60 °C –1 °C/cycle, and 90 s at 72 °C), 20 cycles (30 s at 94 °C, 45 s at 50 °C, and 90 s at 72 °C), and a final 10-min extension step at 72 °C. The CYP71AJ2 PCR product from celery (1498 bp) and those from parsnip (CYP71AJ3, 1485 bp; CYP71AJ4, 1503 bp) were purified and cloned in the pCR8-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) prior to sequencing. In order to identify the specific 5′- and 3′-ends of CYP71AJ3 and CYP71AJ4 orthologs, an inverse PCR strategy adapted from Stemmer and Morris (29Stemmer W.P.C. Morris S.K. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 214-220PubMed Google Scholar) was used. The genomic DNA from parsnip leaves was isolated using the DNeasy plant extraction kit (Qiagen). One μg of genomic DNA from each plant was digested during 2 h at 37 °C by 6 units of the restriction enzyme DraI. After heat inactivation of DraI during 20 min at 65 °C, 0.1 μg of digested gDNA was self-ligated overnight at 16 °C using 4 units of T4 DNA ligase (Invitrogen) in a final volume of 50 μl. This ligated gDNA was used as a matrix for PCR amplification using specific primers. The 5′- and 3′-ends of the celery CYP71AJ2 were amplified using forward primer 5′-GCAATGGCTGTTAATGACCTTGTAGTTGCAAATGTC and reverse primer 5′-ATCATGAGTTTTCAAAACCTCACGAGCCGC. The 5′- and 3′-borders of parsnip CYP71AJ3 and CYP71AJ4 were amplified with the forward primers 5′-GCTATGGCTGTTAATGAGCTTGCTGTAGCAAATGTT and 5′-GCAATCTCTGTTAATGAGCTTGTAGTAGCAAAT and the reverse primers 5′-GACTACATTTCTGGTTAGTTGGATTAATTGCTCGCC and 5′-AGAATTTTCAATATTATCGAGTAACAGAGCAAC, respectively. In each case, the temperature cycles consisted of 5 min at 94 °C, 30 cycles (30 s at 94 °C, 45 s at 55 °C, 150 s at 72 °C). PCR products were purified and then cloned into pCR8 TOPO TA GW vector prior to sequencing. The two parsnip full-length cDNA sequences were PCR-amplified using the 5′-end-specific forward primer 5′-ATGAAGATGCTGGAACAGAATCCCCTGTACCTGTATTTC and the CYP71AJ3 and CYP71AJ4 3′-end-specific primers 5′-TCAAACATGTGGTGTGGCAACCACAAAGAAAGG and 5′-TCAAACATGCGGTGAGGCAACAACCATGAGAGG, respectively. PCR conditions were as follows: 5 min at 94 °C, 30 cycles (30 s at 94 °C, 45 s at 55 °C, 100 s at 72 °C), 10 min at 72 °C using a proofreading polymerase (FideliTaq; GE Healthcare). PCR products were purified, cloned in pCR8 TOPO vector, and sequenced. Yeast Expression and Enzyme Assays—The celery and parsnip CYP71AJ1 orthologs corresponding ORF were ligated in the yeast expression vector pYeDP60 (30Pompon D. Louerat B. Bronine A. Urban P. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 272: 51-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) between KpnI and EcoRI restriction sites. Yeast transformation was performed as described elsewhere (31Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2884) Google Scholar). Propagation of yeast cells and preparation of microsomes were conducted as described previously (23Larbat R. Kellner S. Specker S. Hehn A. Gontier E. Hans J. Bourgaud F. Matern U. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 542-554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Protein amounts were determined according to Bradford (32Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 7: 248-254Crossref Scopus (214515) Google Scholar), and the microsomal P450 contents were determined as described by Omura and Sato (33Omura T. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2370-2378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Enzymatic screening was done with microsomes incubated in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer containing 100 μm substrate and 1 mm NADPH. The incubation was performed for 1 h at 27 °C and 800 rpm agitation (Eppendorf Thermomixer compact). The reaction was stopped by adding 75 μl of MeCN/HCl (99:1). Product formation and substrate consumption were analyzed by reverse phase HPLC on a Purospher 5-μm, 4 × 250-mm end-capped column (Merck). The column was equilibrated in water/acetic acid (99.9/0.1) at a flow rate of 0.9 ml min–1, and the elution was performed under diode array detection (220–400 nm) using a linear gradient of MeCN/methanol (1:1) from 0 to 60% for 25.0 min, followed by 100% MeCN/methanol (1:1) for an additional 10 min. Kinetic Analyses—Kinetic parameters for psoralen synthase activity were determined as previously described (23Larbat R. Kellner S. Specker S. Hehn A. Gontier E. Hans J. Bourgaud F. Matern U. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 542-554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The activity of angelicin synthase was measured for 10.0 min in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 (150.0 μl total), containing 0.5 mm NADPH, 0.5 pmol of the recombinant CYP71AJ4 and varying the concentration of (+)-columbianetin or syn-[3′-D]columbianetin. The apparent Km values were determined by Lineweaver-Burk extrapolations. Mechanism-based inactivation assays were performed as described previously (23Larbat R. Kellner S. Specker S. Hehn A. Gontier E. Hans J. Bourgaud F. Matern U. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 542-554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry Analyses—The product eluting from HPLC at a retention time corresponding to angelicin was collected from 10 incubations, the solvent was evaporated in an air stream, and the pellet was resuspended in chloroform/MeCN (1:1) for gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. The sample (1.0 μl) was injected into a Varian Star 3400 CX spectrometer fitted with a Varian Factor Four 5MS column (15.0 m × 0.25-mm inner diameter, 0.1-μm film) using helium at 5.5 p.s.i. as carrier gas. The column temperature was initially 60 °C for 2 min, ramped to 90 °C at 40 °C min–1 and held for 4 min and then to 200 °C at 10 °C min–1, and finally to 300 °C at 10 °C min–1 and held for 10.0 min. Mass spectra were recorded at 70 eV, scanning from 60 to 400 atomic mass units. HPLC-Solid Phase Extraction (SPE)-1H NMR Analyses—The sample was subjected to coupled HPLC-SPE-1H NMR analysis using the following equipment and experimental conditions. HPLC was performed on an Agilent 1100 chromatography system (quaternary pump G1311A; autosampler G1313A; J&M photodiode array detector operating at a wavelength range between 200 and 620 nm, monitoring wavelength 254 and 325 nm). A LiChrospher 100 RP-18 column (250 × 4 mm, particle size 5 μm) with MeCN/water (0.01% trifluoroacetic acid) as a mobile phase (flow rate 1.0 ml min–1) in linear gradient mode from 10 to 90% MeCN in 40 min was applied. After photodiode array detector detection, the eluting solvent was diluted with H2O by a makeup pump to decrease eluotropic strength. The peak eluting at Rt 10.25 min was trapped on a poly(divinylbenzene) SPE cartridge (HySphere resin GP) using a Prospekt 2 SPE unit (Spark Holland) as an LC-NMR interface. The cartridge containing the trapped peak was dried with a stream of nitrogen gas for 30 min. Then the compound was eluted with MeCN-d3 and transferred through the connecting capillary from the Prospekt 2 SPE unit to the NMR spectrometer (Bruker AV 500). The NMR spectrometer was equipped with a 5-mm TCI cryoprobe and Cryofit™ flow insert (30-μl active volume). The 1H NMR spectrum of the trace sample amount of the enzyme product was measured in MeCN-d3 at 300 K, and 2024 scans were added to the FID. The central line of the solvent signal at δ 1.93 was used for referencing. Residual solvent signals were suppressed using presaturation. 1H NMR data of anti-3′-hydroxy-syn-[3′-D]columbianetin (enzyme product, 500 MHz, MeCN-d3): δ 7.78 (1H, d, JH-4–H-3 = 9.5 Hz, H-4), 7.48 (1H, d, JH-5–H-6 = 8.5 Hz, H-5), 6.80 (1H, d, JH-6–H-5 = 8.5 Hz, H-6), 6.17 (1H, d, JH-3–H-4 = 9.5 Hz, H-3), 4.36 (1H, s), 1.22 (3H, s, CH3), 1.21 (3H, s, CH3). 1H NMR data of syn-[3′-D]columbianetin (substrate, 500 MHz, MeCN-d3): δ 7.76 (1H, d, JH-4–H-3 = 9.5 Hz, H-4), 7.36 (1H, d, JH-5–H-6 = 8.5 Hz, H-5), 6.73 (1H, d, JH-6–H-5 = 8.5 Hz, H-6), 6.13 (1H, d, JH-3–H-4 = 9.5 Hz, H-3), 4.77 (1H, d, JH-2′–H-3′ = 9.8 Hz, H-2′), 3.28 (1H, brd, JH-3′–H-2′ = 9.8 Hz, H-3′), 1.25 (3H, s, CH3), 1.17 (3H, s, CH3). Bioinformatic Analysis—Multiple sequence alignments were generated with ClustalX. Isolation of (+)-Columbianetin—The recent characterization of A. majus CYP71AJ1 (psoralen synthase) (23Larbat R. Kellner S. Specker S. Hehn A. Gontier E. Hans J. Bourgaud F. Matern U. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 542-554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) opened the door to further investigations of furanocoumarin biosynthesis in other Apiaceae. The reaction in the angular pathway analogous to psoralen synthase (angelicin synthase), however, depends on (+)-columbianetin as a substrate (Fig. 1), but this was not available commercially or from laboratory collections and therefore had to be isolated from natural sources. Based on the literature (34Liu R. Sun Q. Shi Y. Kong L. J. Chromatogr. A. 2005; 1076: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 35Wei Y. Ito Y. J. Chromatogr. A. 2006; 1115: 112-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), several two-phase solvent mixtures were used to examine the separation of columbianetin extracted from A. pubescens roots and prepurified by silica column chromatography, and the partition coefficient k = [columbianetin]stat/[columbianetin]mob (36Ito Y. J. Chromatogr. A. 2005; 1065: 145-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar) was analyzed by HPLC. Columbianetin was enriched in the aqueous phase of systems composed of n-hexane, ethyl acetate, methanol, water at volume ratios 5:5:5:5 (I) and particularly 5:5:7:4 (II) with k values of 0.40 and 0.11, respectively. The dry prepurified root extract (221 mg from 30 g of dry root) was therefore dissolved in solvent system II (10 ml) and loaded onto a HSCCC coil for separation at 890 rpm, and the eluate (20-ml fractions) was analyzed by TLC (Fig. 2A). Fractions 6–9 (∼85 ml) were combined; columbianetin was extracted from the aqueous phase after the removal of methanol, evaporated to dryness, and subjected to another round of HSCCC separation in solvent system I at 900 rpm. Fractions containing columbianetin only (>95% purity) as judged by TLC were pooled and examined by HPLC (Fig. 2B). Unequivocal identification of columbianetin was achieved by mass spectral fragmentation and comparison with authentic [3′-D]columbianetin (Fig. 2, C and D), revealing the [M+] at m/z 246 with major fragments at m/z 187 (base peak) and 160.

However, the role of ErbB4 as a potential cancer drug target has remained controversial. Recently, somatic mutations altering the coding region of ErbB4 were described in patients with breast, gastric, colorectal, or non-small cell lung cancer, but the functional significance of these mutations is unknown. Here we demonstrate that 2 of 10 of the cancer-associated mutations of ErbB4 lead to loss of ErbB4 kinase activity due to disruption of functionally important structural features. Interestingly, the kinase-dead ErbB4 mutants were as efficient as wild-type ErbB4 in forming a heterodimeric neuregulin receptor with ErbB2 and promoting phosphorylation of Erk1/2 and Akt in an ErbB2 kinase-dependent manner. However, the mutant ErbB4 receptors failed to phosphorylate STAT5 and suppressed differentiation of MDA-MB-468 mammary carcinoma cells. These findings suggest that the somatic ErbB4 mutations have functional consequences and lead to selective changes in ErbB4 signaling.

ErbB receptors bind several EGF-like growth factors including the neuregulins (NRG). Ligand-induced extracellular homo- or heterodimerization of ErbB receptors is followed by autophosphorylation at intracellular tyrosine residues by juxtaposed tyrosine kinase domains. The phosphorylated tyrosines in the cytoplasmic receptor tail serve as binding sites for various intracellular signal transduction molecules that mediate the cellular responses to ErbB stimulation (1Schlessinger J.

Recent crystallographic and biochemical analyses have indicated that intracellular tyrosine kinases of EGFR and ErbB4 are activated allosterically in an asymmetrical fashion (3Zhang X. Gureasko J.

In the activated dimer the C-terminal lobe of one kinase domain contacts with the N-terminal lobe of another kinase domain, thereby breaking its intrinsic autoinhibited conformation and facilitating catalysis (3Zhang X.

Activation mechanisms of protein kinases have shared features, and the relative spatial orientation of certain residues that are highly conserved within the eukaryotic protein kinome is essential for successful catalysis (5Huse M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2002; 109: 275-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1334) Google Scholar). These include residues that participate in nucleotide binding and transfer of the γ-phosphate group of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to the hydroxyl oxygen atom of a substrate. Conserved regulatory elements of protein kinases include the activation (A)-loop, αC-helix, phosphate binding (P)-loop, and catalytic (C)-loop. The A-loop is involved in stabilizing the inactive conformation, whereas the αC-helix, located in the N-terminal lobe, mediates conformational changes within the catalytic center that activate the kinase. The aspartate-phenylalanine-glycine (DFG) motif at the base of the A-loop and the P-loop participate in binding and coordination of ATP, whereas the C-loop contains the catalytic aspartate residue (Asp-843 in ErbB4), which processes the substrate tyrosine for catalysis (5Huse M.

Although EGFR and ErbB2 are well characterized oncogenes and targets for cancer therapeutics (2Hynes N.E. Lane H.A. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 341-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (2622) Google Scholar), the relevance of ErbB4 as a cancer drug target is poorly understood. Indeed, both roles as a human oncogene as well as a tumor suppressor gene have been proposed (6Gullick W.J. J. Pathol. 2003; 200: 279-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 7Sundvall M.

Lack of knowledge of tumor-associated genetic changes in ErbB4 has precluded addressing their potential loss-of-function or gain-of-function phenotypes. Recently, nine different somatic mutations targeting the ErbB4 kinase domain were reported in patients with either breast, gastric, colorectal, or non-small cell lung cancer (8Soung Y.H. Lee J.W. Kim S.Y. Wang Y.P. Jo K.H. Moon S.W. Park W.S. Nam S.W. Lee J.Y. Yoo N.J. Lee S.H. Int. J. Cancer. 2006; 118: 1426-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In EGFR, similar mutations targeting the kinase domain sensitize patients to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (9Lynch T.J. Bell D.W. Sordella R. Gurubhagavatula S. Okimoto R.A.

In addition, one somatic mutation targeting the cytoplasmic tail of ErbB4 has been reported in a colorectal cancer patient (11Parsons D.W. Wang T.L. Samuels Y. Bardelli A. Cummins J.M. DeLong L.

However, the functional effect of the cancer-associated mutations on ErbB4 activity has not been addressed. Here, we exploited the recently reported crystal structure of ErbB4 kinase domain (4Qiu C. Tarrant M.K. Choi S.H. Sathyamurthy A. Bose R. Banjade S. Pal A. Bornmann W.G. Lemmon M.A. Cole P.A. Leahy D.J.

In addition, we analyzed the basal and ligand-induced phosphotyrosine content of the 9-kinase domain and 1-cytoplasmic domain mutations (8Soung Y.H. Lee J.W. Kim S.Y. Wang Y.P. Jo K.H. Moon S.W.

Nature. 2005; 436: 792Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar) in different cell backgrounds. Our data demonstrate that 2 of the 10 mutations disrupt the catalytic activity of the ErbB4 tyrosine kinase, and there are clear structural reasons for the observed effects. Intriguingly, despite loss of kinase activity, the two mutant receptors were able to form a functional heterodimer with ErbB2 and activate mitogen-activated protein kinase Erk and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt pathways. However, kinase activity of ErbB4 was required for NRG-induced activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5), resulting in a failure of ErbB4 mutants to activate STAT5. Interestingly, when overexpressed in a breast cancer cell line, the two kinase-dead mutants gained an ability to suppress the formation of differentiated acinar structures, unlike the wild-type ErbB4, which promoted differentiation. Thus, although most of the ErbB4 mutations are surface mutations and are not located either near the binding/active site or near the dimerization surface and, hence, appear to be innocuous, for two of the mutants that occur within the binding/active site, the structural and experimental data suggest that the mutations affect kinase activity but not dimerization. These alterations also associate with a selective loss-of-function phenotype affecting specific signal transduction pathways and cellular responses in cancer cells.

The model of ErbB4 with the point mutation D861Y was created with the Bodil modeling environment (13Lehtonen J.V. Still D.J. Rantanen V.V. Ekholm J. Bjorklund D. Iftikhar Z. Huhtala M. Repo S.

To investigate the structural consequences of the D861Y mutation on the function and ATP binding properties of ErbB4, the crystal structure of the EGFR kinase domain in complex with the non-hydrolyzable ATP analog AMP-PNP (PDB ID 2ITX) (14Yun C.H.

Cancer Cell. 2007; 11: 217-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar) was used to position the ligand in the structure of ErbB4. The two kinase structures were first superimposed with Vertaa (15Johnson M. Lehtonen J. Bioinformatics. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK2000: 15-50Google Scholar) implemented in Bodil, and then AMP-PNP and a conserved water molecule important for ATP binding were copied into the “mutated” model structure of ErbB4. Where necessary, new rotamers for side chains within the ATP-binding site were selected from the rotamer library (16Lovell S.C. Word J.M. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. Proteins. 2000; 40: 389-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar) implemented in Bodil. The structural model of ErbB4 with the insertion G802dup was produced with Modeler Version 9.4 (17Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10294) Google Scholar). The model was energy-minimized with Gromacs Version 3.3.3 (18van der Spoel D. Lindahl E. Hess B. Groenhof G. Mark A.E. Berendsen H.J. J. Comput.

Thereafter, the model was visually analyzed, and if necessary for docking purposes, new rotamers for side chains within the ATP-binding site were introduced using Bodil. The ATP analog AMP-PNP was docked into the G802dup model with GOLD Version 3.2 (19Jones G. Willett P. Glen R.C. Leach A.R. Taylor R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 727-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (5162) Google Scholar) by imposing a hydrogen-bonding constraint between the main-chain nitrogen atom of Met-799 and the N1 atom of AMP-PNP. The active site radius was set to 10 Å centered on the Hγ atom of Val-732. The most appropriate docking pose of AMP-PNP to the ErbB4 model was chosen based on visual analysis of the docked conformations. Although ATP binds to ErbB4 and EGFR complexed with a metal cation (20Brignola P.S. Lackey K. Kadwell S.H. Hoffman C. Horne E. Carter H.L. Stuart J.D. Blackburn K. Moyer M.B. Alligood K.J.

COS-7 and MCF-7 cells were transfected with pcDNA3. 1ErbB4JM-aCYT-2 wild type and mutants using the FuGENE 6 Transfection Reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. To generate stable 32D or MDA-MB-468 cell lines expressing wild-type ErbB4 JM-a CYT-2 or its G802dup or D861Y mutants, Phoenix Ampho HEK293 cells were transfected with the corresponding pBABE-puroErbB4JM-aCYT-2 mutant constructs and used for retrovirus production. Subsequently, 32D and MDA-MB-468 cells were infected with retroviral supernatants, and stable pools were selected with puromycin (Sigma). Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—To analyze ErbB4 tyrosine phosphorylation in MCF-7 transfectants, cells were starved overnight, stimulated for 10 min with 25 ng/ml NRG-1 (R&D Systems, Inc.), and lysed. ErbB4 was immunoprecipitated from lysates with anti-ErbB4 antibodies (sc-283; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) and analyzed for phosphotyrosine content by Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (4G10; Upstate Biotechnology Inc.). ErbB4 loading was controlled by Western blotting with the sc-283 antibody. To analyze ErbB4 tyrosine phosphorylation in the MDA-MB-468 background, cells were starved overnight and stimulated for 15 min with 50 ng/ml NRG-1. Cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting using a phospho-specific antibody against Tyr-1284 of ErbB4 (Cell Signaling). Loading was controlled by Western blotting with anti-ErbB4 (E-200; Abcam) and anti-actin (sc-1616; Santa Cruz) antibodies. COS-7 transfectants transiently expressing the indicated ErbB4 constructs with or without ErbB2 or STAT5a were starved overnight in the absence of serum and stimulated for 10 min with 25 ng/ml NRG-1. Cell lysates were analyzed for ErbB4, Erk1/2, Akt, and STAT5 phosphorylation by Western blotting using phospho-specific antibodies (Cell Signaling). Loading was controlled by Western blotting with antibodies recognizing total ErbB4 (sc-283), Erk1/2 (Cell Signaling), Akt (sc-1618; Santa Cruz), or STAT5 (sc-835; Santa Cruz). ErbB2 was immunoprecipitated with anti-ErbB2 antibodies trastuzumab (Roche Applied Science) or sc-284 (Santa Cruz) and analyzed for phosphorylation by Western blotting with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10). ErbB2 loading was controlled by Western blotting with an anti-ErbB2 antibody (sc-284). To inhibit tyrosine kinase activity, cells were incubated for 1 h in the presence of 1 μm gefitinib (AstraZeneca) or M578440 (AZ10398863; AstraZeneca) before stimulation with or without NRG-1. In Vitro Kinase Assay—32D cells stably expressing wild-type ErbB4 JM-a CYT-2 or its engineered G802dup or D861Y mutants were analyzed for ErbB4 in vitro kinase activity in the presence and absence of 10 μm ATP (Roche Applied Science) as described (23Maatta J.A. Sundvall M. Junttila T.T. Peri L. Laine V.J. Isola J. Egeblad M. Elenius K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 67-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). ErbB4 was immunoprecipitated with anti-ErbB4 antibodies (sc-283) and analyzed for phosphotyrosine content by Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (4G10). ErbB4 loading was controlled by Western blotting with the sc-283 antibody. Three-dimensional Cultures—2 × 104 MDA-MB-468 transfectants in 20 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 10% fetal calf serum were suspended into 180 μl of cold Matrigel (BD Biosciences) supplemented with or without 50 ng/ml NRG-1. The cell-Matrigel suspension was divided to duplicate 96-well plate wells, and the Matrigel was allowed to polymerize at 37 °C for 30 min. One hundred μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 10% fetal calf serum containing 0 or 50 ng/ml NRG-1 was added on top of the polymerized Matrigel. The cells were maintained in Matrigel at 37 °C for 6 days, after which formed colonies were counted using Olympus CK40 light microscope. From each well the colonies were counted from 4 individual views through the whole thickness of the Matrigel using 200× magnification. MTT Proliferation Assay—To analyze the proliferation of MDA-MB-468 transfectants, 3 × 103 cells were plated onto 96-well plate wells in triplicates in 100 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 10% fetal calf serum containing 0 or 50 ng/ml NRG-1. At the indicated time points, the number of viable cells was estimated using a CellTiter 96 nonradioactive cell proliferation assay (MTT; Promega) following the manufacturer's recommendations. Nine of the recently reported somatic mutations of ErbB4 target the tyrosine kinase domain (8Soung Y.H. Lee J.W. Kim S.Y. Wang Y.P. Jo K.H. Moon S.W. Park W.S. Nam S.W. Lee J.Y. Yoo N.J. Lee S.H. Int. J. Cancer. 2006; 118: 1426-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), whereas a missense mutation, I1030M, targets the cytoplasmic tail of ErbB4 (11Parsons D.W. Wang T.L. Samuels Y. Bardelli A. Cummins J.M. DeLong L. Silliman N. Ptak J. Szabo S. Willson J.K. Markowitz S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Lengauer C. Velculescu V.E. Nature. 2005; 436: 792Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). To systematically analyze the location and model significance of the nine kinase domain mutations, we exploited the recently reported structure of the ErbB4 kinase domain (4Qiu C. Tarrant M.K. Choi S.H. Sathyamurthy A. Bose R. Banjade S. Pal A. Bornmann W.G. Lemmon M.A. Cole P.A. Leahy D.J. Structure. 2008; 16: 460-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In the case of four of the mutations in ErbB4, R782Q, G802dup, P854Q, and D861Y, the targeted amino acids are conserved within the human ErbB receptor family (26Plowman G.D. Culouscou J.M. Whitney G.S. Green J.M. Carlton G.W. Foy L. Neubauer M.G. Shoyab M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1746-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar); three other mutated positions, Ala-773, Glu-810, and Glu-872, are conserved in all family members except for the weak kinase ErbB3, whereas Val-721 varies as leucine and isoleucine, and Thr-926 varies as alanine and leucine. In Fig. 1B the mutated amino acids are mapped to the structure of a monomer of the wild-type ErbB4 kinase domain, showing their positioning relative to important structural and functional features of the ErbB4 structure. The mutation V721I is located in close proximity to the asymmetrical dimer interface, but the equivalent position in the wild-type EGFR kinase domain is isoleucine, and in the structure of the asymmetric dimer this position is not involved in forming the dimer interface (3Zhang X. Gureasko J. Shen K. Cole P.A. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2006; 125: 1137-1149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar). The mutations A773S and R782Q are located close to each other on the surface of the kinase domain at the C-terminal end of the αC-helix (A773S) and within the loop connecting the αC-helix to the β-sheet of the N-terminal lobe of the kinase domain (R782Q). G802dup is located on the surface of the kinase domain, in a loop connecting the N-terminal and C-terminal lobes, also called the hinge region, whereas D861Y is located at the base of the A-loop. E810K, P854Q, E872K, and T926M are located on the surface of the kinase domain. Glu-810 is at the C-terminal end of helix 3, Pro-854 is within a loop connecting the two strands within the small β-sheet of the C-terminal lobe, Glu-872 is within the A-loop, and Thr-926 is located at the beginning of helix 9. To address their function in vivo, the somatic mutations were engineered by site-directed mutagenesis to one of the ErbB4 isoforms expressed in cancer, ErbB4 JM-a CYT-2 (27Junttila T.T. Sundvall M. Lundin M. Lundin J. Tanner M. Harkonen P. Joensuu H. Isola J. Elenius K. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 1384-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, none of the 10 mutations demonstrated enhanced basal or ligand-induced tyrosine phosphorylation in MCF-7 breast cancer or COS-7 cells compared with wild-type ErbB4 (Fig. 2A; data not shown). Moreover, sensitivity of the ErbB4 mutants to inhibition by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib was not different from wild-type ErbB4 in COS-7 cells (IC50 for ErbB4 ≈ 0.5 μm). In contrast, two mutants, G802dup and D861Y, showed clearly reduced tyrosine phosphorylation in vivo (Fig. 2A). Moreover, results of an in vitro kinase assay demonstrate that in 32D cells devoid of endogenous ErbB expression, both G802dup and D861Y mutants had markedly reduced tyrosine kinase activity (Fig. 2B). Even after a maximal exposure time, only a weak phosphotyrosine signal was detected in the G802dup mutant, whereas the D861Y mutant was completely kinase-dead (data not shown). The findings were reproduced by analyzing the mutants in the context of the other cancer-associated isoform, ErbB4 JM-a CYT-1 (27Junttila T.T. Sundvall M. Lundin M. Lundin J. Tanner M. Harkonen P. Joensuu H. Isola J. Elenius K. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 1384-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. 1), as well as in the context of stable transfections into NIH 3T3 cells (data not shown). These data indicate that 2 of 10 ErbB4 mutants, G802dup and D861Y, have lost their kinase activity. The D861Y mutation is located in the DFG motif, a highly conserved triplet at the base of the activation loop of eukaryotic protein kinases that is crucial for successful phosphotransfer (28Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3775) Google Scholar). In ErbB4, the DFG motif consists of Asp-861, Phe-862, and Gly-863. To investigate the structural consequences of introducing a tyrosine residue at amino acid position 861, we generated a model as described under “Experimental Procedures,” replacing the side chain of aspartate by tyrosine in the ErbB4 crystal structure. Based on our model of wild-type ErbB4 bound to the non-hydrolyzable ATP analog, AMP-PNP, it is likely that upon ATP binding, Asp-861 is hydrogen-bonded to a conserved water molecule (w1 in Fig. 3A). This water molecule would additionally be coordinated by two key residues conserved throughout the family; that is, the side chains of Asp-843 and Asn-848 from the C-loop (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, Asp-843 is thought to act as a catalytic base, removing the hydrogen atom from the hydroxyl group of the substrate tyrosine residue (29Johnson L.N. Noble M.E. Owen D.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar). Thus, introduction of a bulky tyrosine residue into the DFG motif by mutation of Asp-861 not only disrupts the hydrogen bonding network that functions to properly position the ATP terminal phosphate and the side chain of the catalytic Asp-843 (Fig. 3A), but the mutation may also directly interfere with the binding of the substrate. Moreover, a compensatory hydrogen bond cannot be formed between the hydroxyl group of tyrosine at position 861 and the side chain of Asp-843 due to steric hindrance (replacing the Asp-861–w1–Asp-843 interactions by direct hydrogen bonding of D861Y to Asp-843). Furthermore, the size difference, tyrosine versus aspartate, is sufficient to expect some alterations of the local structure, too. These observations indicate that D861Y mutation disrupts the functionally important DFG motif, resulting in catalytic incompetence. To investigate the structural consequences of the insertion of an additional glycine residue adjacent to Gly-802 in the hinge region of the kinase domain, we generated a model of ErbB4 G802dup. Because Gly-802 forms part of the ATP-binding site and is located in close proximity to the adenine ring, the ATP analog AMP-PNP was docked into the model to ass"

Biosci. 2005; 10: 2832-2840Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 4Bennett V. Healy J. Trends Mol. Med. 2008; 14: 28-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In addition, the membrane skeleton is present on the cytoplasmic surface of intracellular membrane compartments; however, the function of the skeleton on most intracellular compartments is not clear. The membrane skeleton is composed of spectrins, actin filaments, and a collection of accessory proteins. Spectrins are tetrameric proteins composed of two α-spectrins and two β-spectrins that together form ∼220-nm-long elastic filaments (2Bennett V. Baines A.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1353-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). In mammals, spectrin proteins are expressed from two α-spectrin genes (α1 and α2) and five β-spectrin genes (β1–β5). The most abundant protein motifs of both α- and β-spectrins are spectrin repeats, which are present in 21 copies in α-spectrins and 16 copies in most β-spectrins (see Fig. 1). Spectrin repeats are ∼106-amino acid motifs that form three-helix coiled-coils. The principal function of the spectrin repeat is to confer elasticity to spectrin (5Rief M. Pascual J. Saraste M. Gaub H.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 553-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 6Johnson C.P. Tang H.Y. Carag C. Speicher D.W. Discher D.E. Science. 2007; 317: 663-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar); however, repeat 15 of most β-spectrins also has the ability to bind to the ankyrin family of accessory proteins (7Kennedy S.P. Warren S.L. Forget B.G. Morrow J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Ankyrins are adaptor proteins that bind the membrane skeleton to membranes through their ability to associate with the cytoplasmic domains of at least 12 distinct families of integral membrane proteins (3Mohler P.J. Bennett V. Front. Biosci. 2005; 10: 2832-2840Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Mammals have three ankyrin genes (Ank1, Ank2, and Ank3), each of which produces a family of proteins (ankyrin-R, -B, and -G, respectively) through alternative splicing. Defects in specific ankyrins or spectrins disrupt membrane linkages that are required for normal cell function in specific tissues and cause a variety of hereditary diseases, including hemolytic anemia, cardiac arrhythmia, premature aging, deafness, and ataxia (4Bennett V. Healy J. Trends Mol. Med. 2008; 14: 28-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 8Dubreuil R.R. J. Membr. Biol. 2006; 211: 151-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Despite the importance of the spectrin-ankyrin association, a structural basis for the interaction has not been established. Structure prediction algorithms suggest that repeat 15 of β-spectrins adopts a three-helix bundle conformation similar to other spectrin repeats; however, sequence comparisons have suggested that repeat 15 has unique features that may confer ankyrin-binding activity (7Kennedy S.P. Warren S.L. Forget B.G. Morrow J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Here, we provide a 1.95 Å resolution crystal structure of spectrin repeats 14–16 of human β2-spectrin. We also provide mutational data that identify the ankyrin-binding surface on repeat 15 of β2-spectrin. Protein Expression and Purification-cDNA encoding spectrin repeats 14–16 of human β2-spectrin was synthesized by PCR and ligated into the pET15b expression vector (Novagen). The resulting plasmid was then transformed into the Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3). Expression of B14–16 protein was induced by 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and expressed B14–16 was purified by sequential column chromatography using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose, Q-Sepharose, and Superose12. The selenomethionine (SeMet) 2The abbreviation used is: SeMet, selenomethionine. variant of B14–16 was expressed in the methionine auxotrophic E. coli strain B834(DE3) and grown in minimal medium supplemented with natural amino acids and SeMet. Expression and purification were unchanged. Crystallization and X-ray Diffraction Data Collection- Crystals of B14–16 were grown using the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method from drops containing 1 μl of protein (25 mg/ml) and 1 μl of reservoir solution (14% polyethylene glycol 4000, 100 mm Tris (pH 8.5), and 300 mm MgCl2) and equilibrated over 200 μl of reservoir solution. Disphenoidal crystals appeared after 3–4 days at 4 °C and grew to their maximal extent by 2 weeks. Crystals were small (0.1-mm maximal length) and thin (0.02-mm thickness). SeMet protein crystallized in an identical fashion. Cryoprotection was performed by increasing the glycerol content in reservoir solution up to 30% in 5% steps over the course of 30 min at 4 °C. Crystals were flash-frozen using liquid propane. Crystals exhibited the symmetry of space group P212121 with unit cell parameters of a = 51.3, b = 56.1, and c = 261.6 Å and contained two molecules of B14–16 per asymmetric unit. Native crystals diffracted isotropically to a dmin of 1.95 Å and SeMet crystals to a dmin of 2.4 Å when exposed to synchrotron radiation.

The crystal structure was solved by the single-wavelength anomalous dispersion method using SeMet-substituted B14–16 protein crystals. The Se-Met crystals diffracted to 2.4 Å, and single-wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing of these data generated an electron density map that was used to produce an initial model. Native crystals diffracted to 1.95 Å, and phases were extended to this limit using the 2.4 Å structure as an initial model. The asymmetric unit contained two molecules of B14–16, 561 waters, one molecule of Tris, four molecules of glycerol and one magnesium ion. The final model had an Rwork of 19.8% and an Rfree of 25.5% at 1.95 Å resolution. Statistics for the data collection and representative electron density are shown in Table 1 and Fig. 2. The structure of B14–16 consists of three spectrin repeats connected by two linkers (Fig. 3). Each spectrin repeat forms an α-helical bundle consisting of three helices (A, B, and C) and two loops (AB and BC). For the purposes of this study, the helices and loops have been designated by repeat number and structural element (e.g. helix-14A refers to the A-helix of repeat 14, loop-15BC refers to the BC-loop of repeat 15). All helices show typical helical hydrogen bond networks with the exception of helix-15B and helix-16B. These helices are kinked near their midpoints and have ordered waters that form hydrogen bonds with backbone amide and carbonyl oxygens at the kink. The linkers between repeats are helical and are contiguous with the C-helix of the preceding repeats and the A-helix of the succeeding repeats. The overall structure of B14–16 is elongated with axial dimensions of 156 × 45 Å. Each helix has a heptad pattern of hydrophobic residues that is typical of α-helical coiled-coils (19Beck K. Brodsky B. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 122: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). These hydrophobic residues form an interlocking network of van der Waals contacts at the core of each spectrin repeat. As part of this heptad pattern, spectrin repeats commonly have tryptophan at position 17 in the A-helix and leucine near the end of the C-helix (20Hartwig J.H. Protein Profile. 1995; 2: 703-800PubMed Google Scholar). Repeats 14 and 16 have both conserved residues; however, repeat 15 has an arginine (Arg1820) in place of the tryptophan at position 17. Arg1820 is not part of the hydrophobic core: instead, the side chain of Leu1856 of helix-15B lies in the space normally occupied by tryptophans at position 17 (Fig. 4). Leu1856 can occupy space in the core because the B-helix of repeat 15 is rotated ∼45° relative to the B-helices of repeats 14 and 16. This rotation points the side chain of Leu1856 toward the core, unlike the corresponding residues in repeats 14 and 16, which are oriented along the edge of the core. Between individual repeats are helical linkers that join the C-helices of preceding repeats with the A-helices of succeeding repeats into one long continuous helix. In the B14–16 structure, van der Waals contacts between repeats dictate the orientation of neighboring repeats about the helical linker. At the N-terminal end of the interface, residues in the linker contact residues in the BC-loop of the succeeding repeat, whereas at the C-terminal end of the interface, residues of the AB-loop of the preceding repeat contact residues from two turns of the A-helix of the succeeding repeat (Fig. 5, A and B). Comparison of the inter-repeat contacts of B14–16 with the previously described contacts between repeats 15–17 of α2-spectrin (21Kusunoki H. Minasov G. Macdonald R.I. Mondragon A. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 495-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) suggests that differences in the inter-repeat contacts contribute to the curvature differences in the two structures. In contrast to the B14–16 inter-repeat contacts, the interfaces in the α2-spectrin structure have less extensive contacts between the AB-loop and the A-helix and have additional contacts between the C-helix and the BC-loop (Fig. 5, C and D). These differences specify a different orientation between repeats in the α2- and β2-spectrin structures. In repeats 15–17 of α2-spectrin, the inter-repeat contacts specify a nearly straight concatomer of repeats, whereas in repeats 14–16 of β2-spectrin, the contacts specify a substantial bend (Fig. 3). Consistent with the observed differences in curvature, electron micrographs of purified spectrin tetramers frequently show greater curvature near their midpoints (22Shotton D.M. Burke B.E. Branton D. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 131: 303-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 23Bennett V. Davis J. Fowler W.E. Nature. 1982; 299: 126-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), where repeats 14–16 of β-spectrins reside (Fig. 1). Ankyrin-binding Site-Kennedy et al. (7Kennedy S.P. Warren S.L. Forget B.G. Morrow J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) used deletion analysis to localize the ankyrin-binding site to repeat 15 and suggested, based upon sequence comparisons, that helix-15B played a role in ankyrin binding. We used yeast two-hybrid analyses to test whether exposed residues of helix-15B are required for ankyrin binding. Alanine mutations were made at 11 surface-exposed residues of helix-15B and tested for their effect on ankyrin binding using the spectrin-binding domains of ankyrin-B and ankyrin-G. None of the 11 mutations prevented the yeast two-hybrid reaction between repeats 13–16 of β2-spectrin and the spectrin-binding domain of either ankyrin-B or ankyrin-G (Fig. 6), suggesting that helix-15B does not play a significant role in ankyrin binding. We next examined helix-15C because the point mutation A1884V in helix-15C of β1-spectrin is associated with hereditary spherocytosis (24Gallagher P.G. Forget B.G. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 1998; 24: 539-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Ten surface-exposed residues of helix-15C were mutated to alanine and tested for ankyrin-binding ability using yeast two-hybrid analyses. As with mutations on helix-15B, none of the mutations in helix-15C prevented ankyrin binding (Fig. 6). Ala1884 of β1-spectrin corresponds to Ala1892 of β2-spectrin, which resides in a hydrophobic pocket formed by Phe1818, Ile1821, and Gln1822. This pocket does not have sufficient space to accommodate a valine, and the A1884V mutation in β1-spectrin may disrupt the structure of repeat 15. Finally, we tested whether loop-15BC plays a role in ankyrin binding. Loop-15BC consists of the sequence AAYA1875, and in contrast to the mutations in the B- and C-helices, mutation of the surface-exposed Tyr1874 to alanine abrogated the yeast two-hybrid interaction with ankyrin (Fig. 6). The AAYA sequence is well conserved between different β-spectrins with the exception of β5-spectrin. β5-Spectrin does not bind to ankyrins (25Stabach P.R. Morrow J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21385-21395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and replacement of the BC-loop sequence of β2-spectrin (AAYA1875) with the corresponding residues of spectrin repeat 15 of β5-spectrin (KLCP1907) also abrogated ankyrin binding (Fig. 6). Together, these observations show that ankyrins bind to loop-15BC of β-spectrins. The spectrin-ankyrin linkage provides the principal mechanism by which the mechanical properties of spectrin are coupled to membranes. Ankyrin binds to spectrin repeat 15 of β-spectrins, and sequence comparisons suggested that repeat 15 has unique features that confer ankyrin binding (7Kennedy S.P. Warren S.L. Forget B.G. Morrow J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of B14–16 shows that the sequence differences in repeat 15 produce only minor structural differences (Fig. 3). The most pronounced structural difference is a small rotation in helix-15B, which is associated with a unique feature in the hydrophobic core in which Leu1856 of the B-helix fills space normally occupied in other spectrin repeats by tryptophans from the A-helix (Fig. 4). Consequences of the rotation in helix-15B partially explain the reported sequence differences of repeat 15 (7Kennedy S.P. Warren S.L. Forget B.G. Morrow J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) but do not explain why ankyrin binds specifically to repeat 15 because alanine mutagenesis experiments suggest that helix-15B does not play a major role in ankyrin binding (Fig. 6). Further mutagenesis experiments also failed to detect a role for helix-15C; however, substitution of alanine at Tyr1874 in loop-15BC did impair ankyrin binding (Fig. 6). Loop-15BC consists of the sequence AAYA1875, which forms a relatively flat, uncharged surface (Fig. 2) that has the potential to form van der Waals and hydrogen bond contacts. These types of contacts are strengthened by moderate ionic strength, and the ankyrin-dependent interaction of spectrin with membranes is most stable at moderate ionic strength (23Bennett V. Davis J. Fowler W.E. Nature. 1982; 299: 126-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 26Burridge K. Kelly T. Mangeat P. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 95: 478-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), consistent with a role for loop-15BC in ankyrin binding. Interestingly, the AAYA1875 → ALCA variant also supported ankyrin binding, and modeling of the ALCA variant suggests that the ALCA sequence forms a flat uncharged surface similar to the AAYA sequence (data not shown). By contrast, the A1875P mutation likely disrupts the structure of loop-15BC because Ala1875 does not have phi-psi angles compatible with proline. A key question regarding the spectrin-ankyrin interaction is how ankyrin maintains its interaction with spectrin during extension of spectrin under mechanical load. Spectrin repeats undergo reversible forced unfolding as spectrin tetramers are stretched in response to shear stresses impingent on the plasma membrane (5Rief M. Pascual J. Saraste M. Gaub H.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 553-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 6Johnson C.P. Tang H.Y. Carag C. Speicher D.W. Discher D.E. Science. 2007; 317: 663-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Despite this unfolding, the attachment of spectrin to membranes remains intact over a broad range of shear stresses (27Discher D.E. Mohandas N. Evans E.A. Science. 1994; 266: 1032-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 28Mohandas N. Evans E. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1994; 23: 787-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), suggesting that the ankyrin linkage to repeat 15 of β-spectrin is maintained even while spectrin repeats are unfolding in response to extension force. Our data, together with previous molecular dynamics simulations of forced unfolding of spectrin repeats, suggest a possible mechanism for how ankyrins maintain their spectrin association. Forced unfolding using atomic force microscopy shows that spectrin repeats unfold through a series of stable intermediates as the ends of spectrin repeats are pulled apart (29Altmann S.M. Grunberg R.G. Lenne P.F. Ylanne J. Raae A. Herbert K. Saraste M. Nilges M. Horber J.K. Structure (Lond.). 2002; 10: 1085-1096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Molecular dynamics simulations of these extensions suggest that a segment centered on the BC-loop is remarkably well preserved in these intermediates (29Altmann S.M. Grunberg R.G. Lenne P.F. Ylanne J. Raae A. Herbert K. Saraste M. Nilges M. Horber J.K. Structure (Lond.). 2002; 10: 1085-1096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The ability of ankyrin to bind to loop-15BC may thus allow ankyrin to maintain its interaction with spectrin even when repeat 15 exists in non-native conformations.

In this study, we identified the mRNA of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor human achaete-scute homologue-1 (hASH1 or ASCL1), which is required for normal development of the nervous system and has been implicated in the formation of neuroendocrine tumors, as a new FMRP target. Using a double-immunofluorescent staining technique we detected an overlapping pattern of both proteins in the hippocampus, temporal cortex, subventricular zone, and cerebellum of newborn rats. Forced expression of FMRP and gene silencing by small interference RNA transfection revealed a positive correlation between the cellular protein levels of FMRP and hASH1. A luciferase reporter construct containing the 5′-untranslated region of hASH1 mRNA was activated by the full-length FMRP, but not by naturally occurring truncated FMR proteins, in transient co-transfections. The responsible cis-element was mapped by UV-cross-linking experiments and reporter mutagenesis assays to a (U)10 sequence located in the 5′-untranslated region of the hASH1 mRNA. Sucrose density gradient centrifugation revealed that hASH1 transcripts were translocated into a translationally active polysomal fraction upon transient transfection of HEK293 cells with FMRP, thus indicating translational activation of hASH1 mRNA. In conclusion, we identified hASH1 as a novel downstream target of FMRP. Improved translation efficiency of hASH1 mRNA by FMRP may represent an important regulatory switch in neuronal differentiation.

FMRP binds to cis-regulatory mRNA elements that include G-quartet structures, poly-U sequences, and the so-called kissing complex (7Penagarikano O. Mulle J.G. Warren S.T. Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 2007; 8: 109-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Beside direct FMRP/RNA binding, FMRP is part of messenger ribonucleoprotein complexes by interaction with further RNA-binding proteins, i.e. the poly-A-binding protein, nucleolin, and others (8Bagni C. Greenough W.T. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 376-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). At least 12 different FMR proteins are generated by alternative mRNA splicing (1Devys D. Lutz Y.

FMRP has been suggested to play a role in synaptic development and plasticity through regulating mRNA transport and local protein synthesis at synapses (10Jin P. Warren S.T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 152-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 11Jin P. Alisch R.S. Warren S.T. Nat.

Med. 2007; 9: 464-472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Accordingly, FMRP was found to gate the translation of a large set of mRNAs in dendrites that are involved in synaptic plasticity. Some of these transcripts are transported in mRNA granules together with FMRP. Activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors has been shown to stimulate synaptic translation of FMRP (13Weiler I.J. Irwin S.A. Klintsova A.Y. Spencer C.M. Brazelton A.D. Miyashiro K. Comery T.A. Patel B. Eberwine J. Greenough W.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Neuron. 2006; 51: 441-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Since protein synthesis by activation of GluR was enhanced in the absence of FMRP (15Huber K.M. Gallagher S.M. Warren S.T. Bear M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7746-7750Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar), a model of mGluR-stimulated inhibition of local mRNA translation by FMRP has been developed (16Bear M.F. Huber K.M. Warren S.T. Trends Neurosci. 2004; 27: 370-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1274) Google Scholar). Reduced synaptic protein formation may explain at least some of the mental deficits in patients suffering from fragile X syndrome due to FMRP deficiency. FMRP may function not only as a translational repressor, but also as an activator of specific mRNA translation (8Bagni C. Greenough W.T. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 376-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Depending on its phosphorylation status (17Ceman S. O'Donnell W.T. Reed M. Patton S. Pohl J. Warren S.T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 3295-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), FMRP co-localizes with actively translating polysomes (18Corbin F. Bouillon M. Fortin A. Morin S. Rousseau F. Khandjian E.W. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 1465-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 19Feng Y. Absher D. Eberhart D.E. Brown V. Malter H.E. Warren S.T. Mol.

A. 2004; 101: 13357-13362Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In addition, FMRP shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm (21Eberhart D.E. Malter H.E. Feng Y. Warren S.T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 1083-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 22Feng Y. Gutekunst C.A. Eberhart D.E. Yi H. Warren S.T. Hersch S.M. J.

Thus, it has been proposed that FMRP might contribute to chromatin remodeling through the RNA interference pathway in the nucleus (8Bagni C. Greenough W.T. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 376-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Furthermore, FMRP has been implicated in mRNA splicing (24Willemsen R. Oostra B.A. Bassell G.J. Dictenberg J. Ment. Retard. Dev. Disabil. Res. Rev. 2004; 10: 60-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), mRNA stabilization (25Zalfa F. Eleuteri B. Dickson K.S. Mercaldo V. De Rubeis S. di Penta A. Tabolacci E. Chiurazzi P. Neri G. Grant S.G. Bagni C. Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 578-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), and as a component of RNA granules like stress granules (26Mazroui R. Huot M.E. Tremblay S. Filion C. Labelle Y. Khandjian E.W. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 3007-3017Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Identification and validation of downstream targets may provide the key to understanding the role of FMRP in neuronal development and disease. Previous attempts to discover FMRP-regulated genes were based mostly on immunoprecipitation of FMRP in mouse tissue followed by extraction and micro-array analysis of co-precipitated RNA (8Bagni C. Greenough W.T. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 376-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 12Bittel D.C. Kibiryeva N. Butler M.G. Genet.

Genes Brain Behav. 2005; 4: 341-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Alternative approaches consisted in the use of random oligonucleotides linked to anti-FMRP antibody to reveal putative FMRP targets (28Miyashiro K.Y. Beckel-Mitchener A. Purk T.P. Becker K.G. Barret T. Liu L. Carbonetto S. Weiler I.J. Greenough W.T. Eberwine J. Neuron. 2003; 37: 417-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar) and in differential display analysis (29Zhong N. Ju W. Nelson D. Dobkin C. Brown W.T. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1999; 84: 268-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Sung Y.J. Conti J. Currie J.R. Brown W.T. Denman R.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 275: 973-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). While these investigations yielded important information on the RNA-binding properties of FMRP, little overlap among the proposed candidate targets was found (8Bagni C. Greenough W.T. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 376-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the precise molecular mechanisms of FMRP function remain elusive (31Zalfa F. Achsel T. Bagni C. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2006; 16: 265-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and the question of how abnormal regulation of a single gene can result in such a diversity of neuronal dysfunctions remains to be answered (32Koukoui S.D. Chaudhuri A. Brain Res. Rev. 2007; 53: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Thus, the goal of this study was to identify potential new FMRP targets, which play a pivotal role in gene regulation during neuronal development. Starting with an unbiased combined approach of gene ontology and motif search followed by extensive experimental analyses we characterize the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, human achaete-scute homologue-1 (hASH1 or ASCL1), as a new FMRP target and describe its molecular mechanism of regulation by FMRP in detail. Because hASH1 is crucial in generating neuronal diversity by regulating neuronal subtype specification and differentiation (33Bertrand N. Castro D.S. Guillemot F. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 517-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar), our findings offer a new view of how FMRP influences neuronal development. Cell Culture—Human embryonic kidney (HEK)293 cells (ACC 305) were obtained from the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (Braunschweig, Germany). The cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose, PAA Laboratories GmbH, Cölbe, Germany), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Biochrom KG, Berlin, Germany), 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 15 mm Hepes, and 2 mm glutamine, at 37 °C, 5% CO2. For primary hippocampal neurons animals were sacrificed according to the permit (LaGeSo, 0122/07) given by the Office for Health Protection and Technical Safety of the regional government of Berlin and in compliance with regulations laid down in the European Community Council Directive. Hippocampal cultures from E19 Wistar rats were prepared as previously described (34Eichler S.A. Kirischuk S. Juttner R. Legendre P. Lehmann T.N. Gloveli T. Grantyn R. Meier J.C. J. Cell Mol. Med. 2008; 12: 2848-2866Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and maintained for 8 days in vitro in B27- and 1% fetal calf serum-supplemented neurobasal medium (35Brewer G.J. Cotman C.W. Brain Res. 1989; 494: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Plasmids—For expression of the full-length FMRP, a construct described earlier (36Darnell J.C. Jensen K.B. Jin P. Brown V. Warren S.T. Darnell R.B. Cell. 2001; 107: 489-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar) (kind gift of J. Darnell) served as a template for re-cloning of the FMR1 cDNA into the CMV promoter based pEGFP-C1 vector (BD Biosciences, Clontech, Heidelberg, Germany). FMRP-variant expression vectors (also under control of a CMV-promoter) were purchased by Deutsches Ressourcenzentrum für Genomforschung GmbH (Berlin, Germany). For the generation of useful luciferase reporter constructs, the pGL3-promotor vector, which contains a constitutive SV40 promoter (Promega, Madison, WI), was modified as follows: The vector-specific 5′- and 3′UTRs of luciferase mRNA were replaced by the human hASH1 mRNA UTRs. The UTRs were amplified by PCR using a hASH1 full-length cDNA clone (Deutsches Ressourcenzentrum für Genomforschung GmbH) as template, and restriction sites were added by primer extension. The following cis-elements were deleted in the hASH1 5′UTR: U-rich element (positions 223–232), G-quartet motif (positions 304–330), and AU-rich element (positions 397–416) according to the ASCL1 sequence accession number gi:190343011 (NM_004316). The quality of processed vectors was confirmed by sequencing. Cell Transfection Experiments and Reporter Gene Assays—Cultured cells were grown to ∼70% confluence in 96-well plates (μClear Platte 96K, Greiner BIO-ONE GmbH, Frickenhausen, Germany) and transiently co-transfected with a reporter construct containing the firefly luciferase gene flanked by the 5′- and/or 3′UTRs of hASH-1 mRNA (pGL3-promoter vector; Promega), and the Renilla luciferase phRL-TK vector (Promega). A ratio (DNA:transfection reagent) of 1:3 was used with the FuGENE 6 Transfection Reagent (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Transfection of HEK293 cells with empty pGL3-promoter vector served as control. Co-transfection with the Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid was performed for normalization of transfection efficiencies. The luciferase activities were measured in a luminometer (Labsystems Luminoscan RS, Helsinki, Finland) programmed with individual software (Luminoscan RII, Ralf Mrowka) 24 h after transfection as described in Ref. 37Mrowka R. Steege A. Kaps C. Herzel H. Thiele B.J. Persson P.B. Bluthgen N. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 5120-5129Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar. Luciferase mRNA quantification was performed as described recently (38Ufer C. Wang C.C. Fähling M. Schiebel H. Thiele B.J. Billett E.E. Kuhn H. Borchert A. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 1838-1850Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). For forced expression of FMR proteins, cells were transfected in 6-well or 60-mm dishes for 36 h using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent as described above. For transfection of siRNAs human neuroblastoma-derived Kelly cells (ACC 355) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and grown to ∼50% confluence in 60-mm dishes in RPMI medium (PAA Laboratories) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Biochrom KG, Berlin, Germany), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 1% glutamate (all from Invitrogen). The siRNA for targeting the human FMR1 gene (NCBI accession number NM_002024) was synthesized by Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). A pool of non-targeting siRNAs (Dharmacon, 200 pmol per dish) was used as a negative control. To achieve maximum efficiency of gene silencing the cells were transfected with a mixture of four different siRNAs, each at 50 pmol per dish. For this purpose the siRNAs were diluted at a 1:20 volume ratio in 0.2 ml of serum- and antibiotic-free RPMI. Likewise, the DharmaFECT® transfection reagent (Perbio Science, Bonn, Germany) was diluted (1:100) in 0.2 ml of serum- and antibiotic-free RPMI. The diluted siRNAs and the transfection reagent were combined and kept at room temperature for 20 min to allow complex formation. In the meantime the culture medium was removed from the cells and replaced with 1.6 ml of fresh RPMI/10% fetal calf serum. The siRNA transfection mixtures (0.4 ml) were carefully added to the cells, which were subsequently grown in the tissue culture incubator for 60 h. Determination of mRNA and Protein Levels—Total RNA was isolated from cultured cells with the TRIzol® reagent (Invitrogen). First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed with 2 μgof total RNA using oligo(dT) primers and superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). mRNA quantification was performed as described previously (39Fähling M. Mrowka R. Steege A. Martinka P. Persson P.B. Thiele B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9279-9286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The following intron bridging primers were used for the amplification reactions: hASH1-forward: 5′-CGACTTCACCAACTGGTTCT, hASH1-reverse: 5′-CCGTGAATGATTGGAGTGC, β-actin-forward: 5′-TGAAGTGGTACGTGGACATC, and β-actin-reverse: 5′-GTCATAGTCCGCCTAGAAGC. Cytosolic protein extracts were prepared from cultured cells as described previously (40Fähling M. Mrowka R. Steege A. Nebrich G. Perlewitz A. Persson P.B. Thiele B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 26089-26101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel. The proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Biosciences) with the use of a semidry blotting apparatus (Bio-Rad). Immunodetection of hASH1 and FMRP was performed according to our routine protocol with the following primary antibodies: anti-Mash1 antibody diluted 1:500 (#556604, BD Biosciences), anti-FMR1, diluted 1:1000 (H-120, #sc28739, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), mouse monoclonal antibody against β-actin in a 1:1000 dilution (#MAB1501R, Chemicon, Schwalbach/Ts, Germany). The anti-β-actin antibody was applied after stripping the membranes with 0.2 m NaOH at room temperature for 6 min to reveal possible differences in protein loading. Primary antibodies were detected with peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies, and the reaction products were visualized with the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences). Antibodies, Immunofluorescence, and Quantification—Mash1 and FMRP were stained using mouse monoclonal (1:500, clone 24B72D11.1, #556604, BD Biosciences) and rabbit polyclonal (1:500, H-120, #sc28739, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies, respectively. Immunofluorescence staining was performed on primary hippocampal neurons and on horizontal sections of postnatal day 2 (P2) rat brain fixed with ice-cold mixture of paraformaldehyde and sucrose (4% both) in phosphate-buffered saline buffer. Primary neurons and 2- to 3-mm thick freshly isolated horizontal rat brain sections were fixed for 15 min at room temperature and 1 h at 4 °C, respectively. After fixation slices were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature and cryoprotected overnight at 4 °C in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 8% sucrose. Brain sections were embedded in O.C.T. TissueTek (Sakura Finetec), and 12-μm cryosections were obtained (CM1850, Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) and mounted on Superfrost Plus microscope slides (Menzel GmbH, Braunschweig, Germany). Sections were post-fixed for 5 min with ice-cold paraformaldehyde/sucrose. Prior to incubation with antibodies (1 h at room temperature) primary neurons were permeabilized with 0.12% Triton X-100 for 4 min at room temperature. Antibody reaction with cryosections occurred overnight at 4 °C in phosphate-buffered saline-gelatin supplemented with 0.12% Triton X-100. Appropriate control experiments were performed using species-matched normal sera instead of specific primary antibodies. Secondary antibodies (1:200 each) were coupled to carboxymethyl indocyanine or fluorescein isothiocyanate (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). Preparations were mounted in 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole-containing Vectashield medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The slides were viewed under an epifluorescence microscope (Olympus BX51, Olympus Deutschland GmbH, Hamburg, Germany). Images were acquired with a 14-bit cooled charge-coupled device camera (Spot PURSUIT, Visitron Systems GmbH, Puchheim, Germany) and the software Metamorph (Universal Imaging Corp., Downingtown, PA). Cell-matched signals were quantified within circular, nucleus-centered, regions of interest (Mash and FMRP: diameter 50 and 150 pixels, respectively). Integrated fluorescence intensities were obtained from min/max-thresholded images using Metamorph. Correlation analysis was performed using the Spearman rank order algorithm. RNA-Protein Interaction Studies: UV Cross-linking—In vitro transcripts representing the 5′- or 3′UTR of hASH1 mRNA were radioactively labeled using [α-32P]uridine-, [α-32P]cytosine-, [α-32P]adenine-, or [α-32P]guanosine-5′-triphosphate (800 Ci/mmol, MP Biomedicals GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany). In vitro transcripts were purified by BD Chroma Spin™-100 (DEPC) columns (BD Bioscience). 1–2 ng of the [α-32P]NTP labeled in vitro transcripts (corresponding to 100,000 cpm) was incubated with 35 μg of cytosolic protein extract for 30 min at room temperature in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 3 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 150 mm KCl, and 2 units/μl RNaseOUT (Invitrogen Life Technologies) in the presence of rabbit rRNA (0.5 μg/μl) as competitor. The samples were exposed to UV light (255 nm, 1.6 Joule, UV-Stratalinker) on ice, then treated with RNase-A (30 μg/ml final concentration) and RNase-T1 (750 units/ml final concentration) for 15 min at 37 °C and subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE and subsequent autoradiography using the Phospho-Imager-System (Fujifilm FLA-3000). For cis-element analyses by label transfer, transcripts were separately labeled using the four nucleotides U-, C-, A- or GTP. The radioactive counts of all nucleotides were adjusted to comparable levels before in vitro transcription. Equal RNA concentrations of the resulting in vitro transcripts were used for the UV-cross-linking assay. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay/Supershift Assay—Cytosolic extract (35 μg of protein) of HEK293 cells transiently transfected with either FMRP expression vector or empty vector control (mock) were incubated with hASH1 mRNA 5′UTR in vitro transcripts at 10,000 cpm. The binding reaction was carried out in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 3 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 150 mm KCl, 2 units/μl RNaseOUT (Invitrogen Life Technologies), 0.5 μg/μl rabbit rRNA for 30 min at room temperature. The formed RNA-protein complexes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-FMRP antibody or anti-β-actin control antibody with gentle shaking. The complexes were separated by electrophoresis (0.5 × TBE buffer (50 mm Tris-borate, 2 mm EDTA)). Radioactive signals were detected using the Phospho-Imager-System (Fujifilm FLA-3000). Sucrose Gradient Centrifugation and Polysomal Profiles—Prior to lysis, cells were pre-treated with cycloheximide (100 μg/ml) for 10 min. Cells were lysed on ice for 10 min in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm KCl, 30 mm MgCl2, 100 μg/ml cycloheximide, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1× proteinase inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics), 100 units/ml of RNase inhibitor (MBI Fermentas GmbH, St. Leon-Rot, Germany), and 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Cytosolic extracts were obtained after centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The cytoplasmic supernatant was layered onto 11 ml of a linear 17–51% sucrose gradient (0.5–1.5 m sucrose, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and centrifuged for 2 h at 36.000 rpm using a Beckman SW-41 rotor. Following sedimentation, the gradient solution was pumped out from the bottom with a peristaltic pump. The ribosomal profile was continuously determined at an absorbance of 254 nm using a 2138 UVICORD-S UV monitor (LKB Bromma). Sucrose gradients were split into 12 subfractions each, starting with 1 (bottom) to 12 (top). For protein isolation trichloroacetic acid was supplemented to a 10% final concentration. Precipitated proteins were sedimented, washed twice with acetone, and solved in buffer (25 mm Tris, 1% SDS). RNA was isolated using the E.Z.N.A. RNA Total Kit (#OMEGR6834-02, VWR International, Darmstadt, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Selection of Potential FMRP Targets—We obtained UTR sequences from the 5′ and 3′ ends of the RNA from the ENSEMBL data base using the BIOMART tool. The underlying genomic data came from the human NCBI36 dataset representing 56,511 unique transcripts from 32,562 ENSEMBL genes. The dataset of the 3′UTRs and 5′UTRs consisted of 38,857 and 38,685 sequences, respectively. These numbers are smaller than the total number of transcripts, because some genes did not have a UTR prediction. These data were the basis for the motif search for poly-U stretches (U[8]) and G-quartet motifs according to the consensus [DWGG(N0–2)DWGG(N0–1)DWGG(N0–1)DWGG] (D = A/G/T, W = A/T, and N = A/T/C/G) (36Darnell J.C.

An additional filter step was the selection based on known molecular function. The prediction of molecular function was obtained with BIOMART from the ENSEMBLE data base. We used the Gene-Ontology classification identifiers for that purpose. The gene ontology is a rooted tree-like structured classification. The database entries in ENSEMBLE do contain the last tree children only, but not the complete ontology tree. Therefore we remapped the complete tree structure for each ontology entry. From all genes we selected those having a positive “GO:0007399: nervous system development” in their complete remapped ontology trees. Statistics—If not otherwise indicated, all values are presented as means ± S.D. Students' paired t test was performed to reveal statistical significances. p values <0.05 were considered significant. Selection of Potential FMRP Targets—To identify potential FMRP target mRNAs with a role in neuronal development we selected all genes belonging to the gene ontology class “nervous system development” and searched within their mRNA untranslated regions (UTRs) for poly-U stretches (U[≥8]) and G-quartet motifs according to the consensus [DWGG(N0–2)DWGG(N0–1)DWGG(N0–1)DWGG] (D = A/G/T, W = A/T, and N = A/T/C/G) (36Darnell J.C.

We retrieved 5545 unique genes that had a poly-U stretch or a G-quartet in their mRNA 5′-or 3′UTR. When all genes were filtered for the gene ontology “nervous system development” we obtained 336 genes. Within the dataset of all genes a total number of 682 transcription factors was identified. Appling all three criteria together, we ended with a list of 17 genes. The complete relationships between the sets are presented in the Venn diagram in Fig. 1. A summary of the genes matching all criteria is given in supplemental Table S1 together with detailed motif information. The hASH1 mRNA encoded by the ASCL1 gene was selected for detailed analysis of potential FMRP interaction, because the hASH1 mRNA UTRs ind"
https://openalex.org/W1993678634,"The conditional knockout of the small GTPase Cdc42 from neuroepithelial (NE) and radial glial (RG) cells in the mouse telencephalon has been shown to have a significant impact on brain development by causing these neural progenitor cells to detach from the apical/ventricular surface and to lose their cell identity. This has been attributed to the requirement for Cdc42 in establishing proper apical/basal cell polarity and cell-cell adhesions. In the present study, we provide new insights into the role played by Cdc42 in the maintenance of neural progenitor cells, using the mouse embryonal carcinoma P19 cell line as a model system. We show that the ability of P19 cells to undergo the transition from an Oct3/4-positive, undifferentiated status to microtubule-associated protein 2-positive neurons and glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive astrocytes, upon treatment with retinoic acid (RA), requires RA-induced activation of Cdc42 during the neural cell lineage specification phase. Experiments using chemical inhibitors and RNA interference suggest that the actions of Cdc42 are mediated through signaling pathways that start with fibroblast growth factors and Delta/Notch proteins and lead to Cdc42-dependent mTOR activation, culminating in the up-regulation of Hes5 and Pax6, two transcription factors that are essential for the maintenance of NE and RG cells. The constitutively active Cdc42(F28L) mutant was sufficient to up-regulate Hes5 and Pax6 in P19 cells, even in the absence of RA treatment, ultimately promoting their transition to neural progenitor cells. The ectopic Cdc42 expression also significantly augmented the RA-dependent up-regulation of these transcription factors, resulting in P19 cells maintaining their neural progenitor status but being unable to undergo terminal differentiation. These findings shed new light on how Cdc42 influences neural progenitor cell fate by regulating gene expression.

In vertebrates, central nervous system development starts with the formation of the neural tube from the embryonic ectoderm (1Gotz M. Huttner W.B. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 777-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar, 2Kriegstein A. Noctor S. Martinez-Cerdeno V. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2006; 7: 883-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). At its earliest stage, the neural tube consists of single-layered neuroepithelial (NE) 2The abbreviations used are: NE, neuroepithelial; RG, radial glial; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; RA, retinoic acid; FGFR, fibroblast growth factor receptor; DAPT, N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl-l-alanyl)]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester; siRNA, short interfering RNA; RT, reverse transcription; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; TuJ1, βIII-tubulin; MAP2, microtubule-associated protein-2; GFAP, glial fibrillary acidic protein; APP, amyloid precursor protein; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; RAGE, receptor for advanced glycation-end products;α-MEM,α-minimal essential medium; PBD, Cdc42/Rac-binding domain from PAK; GST, glutathione S-transferase. cells. As embryogenesis proceeds, these single-layered structures undergo expansion into multilayered structures, mediated through the asymmetric division of NE cells in the ventricular zone and the directional cell migration of their daughter cells. In the later stages of development of the mouse telencephalon, two groups of cells, radial glial (RG) cells and basal progenitor cells, reside in different layers. RG cells, like NE cells, remain in the ventricular zone near the apical/inner surface, throughout embryogenesis. In contrast, basal progenitor cells reside in the subventricular zone, close to the basal layer of NE cells, and transiently amplify during embryogenesis and gradually disappear (1Gotz M. Huttner W.B. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 777-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar, 2Kriegstein A. Noctor S. Martinez-Cerdeno V. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2006; 7: 883-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). The establishment and maintenance of neural progenitor cell populations are essential for proper central nervous system development, and knockout and mutant mice of several genes show defects in this process. For example, Hes family and Pax6 transcription factors are specifically expressed in the ventricular zone-residing apical progenitor cells, including NE and RG cells, but not in basal progenitor cells of the mouse forebrain (3Gotz M.

Mice lacking these genes as a result of knockout or mutation show defects in the maintenance of apical progenitor cells (3Gotz M. Stoykova A. Gruss P.

Biol. 2007; 302: 50-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The small GTPase Cdc42 has also been reported to participate in the proper maintenance of apical progenitor cells. Once Cdc42 is depleted from these cells in the mouse telencephalon, they detach from the apical/ventricular surface (8Chen L. Liao G. Yang L. Campbell K. Nakafuku M. Kuan C.Y. Zheng Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 16520-16525Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 9Cappello S. Attardo A. Wu X. Iwasato T. Itohara S. Wilsch-Brauninger M. Eilken H.M. Rieger M.A. Schroeder T.T. Huttner W.B. Brakebusch C. Gotz M. Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 1099-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), lose their cellular identity, and finally change into randomly distributed basal progenitor cells (9Cappello S. Attardo A. Wu X. Iwasato T. Itohara S. Wilsch-Brauninger M. Eilken H.M. Rieger M.A. Schroeder T.T. Huttner W.B. Brakebusch C. Gotz M. Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 1099-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Previous reports suggested that these phenotypes were due to the loss of epithelial structures at the apical/ventricular surface, as a result of the absence of Cdc42 and its ability to control apical/basal polarity and cell-cell adhesions in apical progenitor cells (8Chen L. Liao G. Yang L. Campbell K. Nakafuku M. Kuan C.Y. Zheng Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 16520-16525Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 9Cappello S. Attardo A. Wu X. Iwasato T.

Indeed, the roles played by Cdc42 in the establishment of cell polarity and cell-cell adhesions are central to many aspects of organogenesis (10Heasman S.J. Ridley A.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 690-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar, 11Wu X. Li S. Chrostek-Grashoff A. Czuchra A. Meyer H. Yurchenco P.D. Brakebusch C. Dev.

Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 571-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). However, Cdc42 is also involved in a wide range of intracellular activities by regulating intracellular trafficking, cell cycle progression, and gene expression (13Jaffe A.B. Hall A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 247-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (2377) Google Scholar, 14Cerione R.A.

Thus, it was of interest to see whether Cdc42 plays other roles in neural differentiation, especially when cells commit to neural cell lineages from their pluripotent undifferentiated status. One downstream signaling target of Cdc42 that is of particular interest is the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a serine/threonine kinase (17Fang Y. Park I.H. Wu A.L. Du G. Huang P. Frohman M.A. Walker S.J. Brown H.A. Chen J. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 2037-2044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 18Chou M.M. Blenis J. Cell. 1996; 85: 573-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). mTOR is a key regulator of cell growth and proliferation and has also been implicated in the survival of neural stem/progenitor cells as mediated by Notch/Delta proteins through their regulation of the expression of Hes family transcription factors (19Androutsellis-Theotokis A. Leker R.R. Soldner F. Hoeppner D.J. Ravin R. Poser S.W. Rueger M.A. Bae S.K. Kittappa R. McKay R.D. Nature. 2006; 442: 823-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). Although both Cdc42 and mTOR are essential for the maintenance of the neural stem/progenitor cell population in developing or adult brains, thus far a direct functional connection has not been established between Cdc42 and mTOR in central nervous system development. In this study, we have set out to determine whether such a link exists, and if so, how it might impact neural differentiation, using P19 cells as a model system. The embryonal carcinoma P19 cell line was established from a teratocarcinoma caused by the transplantation of a mouse embryo (20McBurney M.W. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1993; 37: 135-140PubMed Google Scholar, 21McBurney M.W. Jones-Villeneuve E.M. Edwards M.K. Anderson P.J. Nature. 1982; 299: 165-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). P19 cells express the pluripotent marker Oct3/4, similar to embryonic stem cells. However, in response to specific extracellular stimuli and differentiation conditions, they lose Oct3/4 expression and differentiate into ectodermal (neurons and glia cells) (20McBurney M.W. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1993; 37: 135-140PubMed Google Scholar, 21McBurney M.W. Jones-Villeneuve E.M. Edwards M.K. Anderson P.J. Nature. 1982; 299: 165-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 22Bain G.

Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1999; 9: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), as well as into single-layered epithelia (24Jones-Villeneuve E.M. McBurney M.W. Rogers K.A. Kalnins V.I. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 94: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). By taking advantage of P19 cells that show a retinoic acid (RA)-dependent transition from an Oct3/4-positive, undifferentiated status to neural progenies, we demonstrate that Cdc42, in response to RA-induced extrinsic factors (i.e. fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and Delta ligands), activates mTOR to up-regulate the expression of the Hes5 and Pax6 transcription factors. Cdc42 depletion inhibits mTOR activation and the resultant up-regulation of Hes5 and Pax6, thereby disrupting RA-induced neural differentiation. The ectopic expression of the constitutively active mutant Cdc42(F28L) is sufficient for mTOR activation and up-regulation of Hes5 and Pax6, stimulating P19 cells to differentiate into Oct3/4-/Nestin+ neural progenitor cells in the absence of RA stimulation. We also show that the ectopic expression of Cdc42 significantly augments the RA-dependent up-regulation of these transcription factors and, consequently, maintains cells at the neural progenitor stage and blocks terminal differentiation. These findings highlight a potentially important role for Cdc42, by working together with mTOR, to influence apical progenitor cell fate by regulating the expression of key transcription factors. Antibodies—Polyclonal anti-mouse Nestin repeat (Nestin18) antibody was from Covance. Monoclonal anti-Cdc42 antibody was from Upstate. The neuron-glial cell marker sampler kit containing antibodies for MAP2, βIII tubulin (TuJ1), and GFAP was from Chemicon. Monoclonal anti-Oct3/4 (C10), GAP43 (B5), and polyclonal anti-Cdc42 (P1) antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Monoclonal RC2 and anti-myosin heavy chain antibodies (MF20) were obtained from Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (The University of Iowa). Monoclonal anti-vinculin antibody was from Sigma. Cell Culture and Differentiation—P19 cells (ATCC) were cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2, with α-MEM supplemented with 7.5% CS and 2.5% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) (10% serum growth medium). Cells were sub-cultured by trypsinization and used within 10 passages after thawing from liquid nitrogen stocks. The procedures used for RA-induced neural differentiation are depicted in Fig. 1A. Briefly, 1 × 106 cells were cultured on a 100-mm bacterial grade dish in α-MEM supplemented with 3.5% calf serum, 1.5% fetal bovine serum, and 1 μm RA (neural-induction medium) (day 0). On day 2, cells were collected by centrifugation and placed into a bacterial grade dish with fresh neural induction medium. On day 4, the cells were again collected by centrifugation and trypsinized to disrupt cell aggregation, and then seeded (250 cells/mm2) onto poly-l-lysine-(Sigma) coated 100-mm tissue culture plates in 10% serum growth medium without RA. On day 6, the medium was changed to neurobasal medium containing B27 supplement (Invitrogen) and 2 mm glutamine (terminal differentiation medium). Although the B27 supplement included vitamin A, we confirmed that the terminal differentiation medium alone was not sufficient to induce neural differentiation in the absence of additional RA. The FGF receptor inhibitor PD173074 (final concentration, 20 nm), the γ-secretase inhibitor N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl-l-alanyl)]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT) (Calbiochem, final concentration, 200 nm), and the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin (Calbiochem, final concentration, 20 nm), were added on days 0 and 2 during the RA-dependent neural differentiation protocol. For the -RA culture conditions, the cells were cultured on bacterial grade dishes in 5% serum-containing α-MEM and then trypsinized on day 4. For DMSO-induced myogenic differentiation, cells (1 × 106) were cultured on a bacterial grade dish in 5% serum-containing α-MEM with 1% DMSO. On day 2, the DMSO-containing medium was replenished. On day 4, cells were collected, trypsinized, and then seeded onto non-coated tissue culture plates in 10% serum growth medium without DMSO. The medium was exchanged daily, and cells were cultured until the indicated day. In some cases, we were interested in examining whether ectopically expressed Cdc42 was capable of inducing P19 cells to undergo RA-independent terminal differentiation into neural cells. For these experiments, the cells were cultured in bacterial grade dishes with 5% serum-containing α-MEM without RA, and then trypsinized on day 4 and grown on poly-l-lysine-coated tissue culture plates with 10% medium, before switching on day 6 to neurobasal medium. Transfection and RNA Interference—Constructs expressing Myc-tagged wild-type Cdc42 and Cdc42(F28L) were generated as previously described (27Tu S. Wu W.J. Wang J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49293-49300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Transfections were carried out using Lipofectamine as suggested by the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). To establish stable cell lines, cells were selected with 500 μg/ml G418 (Research Products International) and then maintained in growth medium supplemented with 250 μg/ml G418, with the drug being removed prior to experiments. P19 cells (that were 50–70% confluent) were transfected with Cdc42-targeting siRNAs (Invitrogen) or control siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000. The following day, the cells were transferred to bacterial grade dishes to induce differentiation. The transfection efficiency (∼90%) was measured using Block-iT Fluorescent Oligo (Invitrogen). PBD Pulldown Assays—Cdc42-activation assays were performed in pulldown experiments using glutathione S-transferase (GST) fused to the limit Cdc42/Rac-binding domain from PAK (called the PBD) as described previously (27Tu S. Wu W.J. Wang J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49293-49300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Briefly, whole cell lysates were collected with lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 20 mm NaF, 20 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin and aprotinin) containing 2 mm MgCl2. Lysate proteins (300 μg) were incubated with glutathione-agarose beads bound to 50 μg of recombinant GST or GST-PBD at 4 °C for 90 min. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer and then subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Undifferentiated cells were seeded on 2-well LabTech chambers (Nalge Nunc International). Cells subjected to the differentiation protocols were transferred on day 4 from bacterial grade dishes to poly-l-lysine-coated chamber slides or to 60-mm tissue culture plates. After culturing for the indicated times, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton, blocked with phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% bovine serum albumin, and incubated with primary antibodies. The cells were then washed and stained with Texas Red-, Oregon Green 488-, or Alexa Fluor 633-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (Molecular Probes). Chromatin was stained with 4,6-diaminodino-2-phenylindole (Sigma). Epifluorescence images were captured using an Axioskop inverted microscope (Carl Zeiss) equipped with an AxioCam or Sensicam qe charge-coupled device camera system (The COOKE Corp.). RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from cells at the indicated time points using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Reverse transcriptase (RT) reactions were performed with SuperScript III enzyme (Invitrogen), using oligo(dT) nucleotides as a primer. Following the RT reactions, the DNA products were subjected to the PCR using primer sets to amplify specific genes. To exclude the possibility that we are amplifying contaminating genomic DNA, RT reactions lacking the Superscript III enzyme were performed on the RNA samples. The negative control samples were subjected to PCR using the primer set for Gapdh (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) and are indicated at the bottom of each figure as -RT GAPDH. The DNA primers, annealing temperature, and number of PCR cycles used to amplify each gene, are listed in supplemental Table S1. For semi-quantitative RT-PCR, the DNA products were subjected to real-time PCR using Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix and the 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). Each reaction was performed in triplicate, and the amount of target RNA was normalized relative to the amount of Gapdh mRNA. Characteristics of the Neural Differentiation of Mouse Embryonic P19 Cells—Fig. 1A depicts the protocol used for the RA-dependent neural differentiation of P19 cells. Prior to treatment with RA, P19 cells strongly express the pluripotent transcription factor Oct3/4 but show little or no expression of neural-specific differentiation markers like GAP43, βIII-tubulin (TuJ1), and microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP2) (Fig. 1B). To induce neural differentiation, the cells were cultured in bacterial grade dishes to undergo embryoid body-like aggregation. Upon stimulation with RA, the expression of Oct3/4 was dramatically reduced (Fig. 1B). We also monitored the mRNA levels of several transcription factors necessary for neural differentiation, using RT-PCR. The Hes family of transcription factors and Pax6 are highly expressed in NE and RG cells and play a role in establishing and maintaining the neural stem/progenitor cell population (3Gotz M.

Fig. 1C shows that the mRNA levels of each of these transcription factors were quite low in the undifferentiated P19 cells, but were highly up-regulated in response to RA during the neural cell lineage specification phase (day 4). At the terminal differentiation phase, i.e. day 11 in the RA-induced neural differentiation protocol, the expression levels of these transcription factors were slightly down-regulated (Fig. 1C). By day 7 of the RA-induced neural differentiation protocol, the expression of the neuronal markers GAP43 and TuJ1 was detected (Fig. 1B), and the cells began to extend neurites (see the TuJ1 staining in supplemental Fig. S1, second column of panels from the left). To promote terminal differentiation, the medium was changed to serum-free neurobasal medium with B27 supplement at day 6 (Fig. 1A). This resulted in the expression of the mature neuron-specific gene product, MAP2 (Fig. 1B), and culminated in the formation of axons (stained by GAP43; see supplemental Fig. S1, third column of panels from the left) and dendrites (stained by MAP2; Fig. 1D, top set of panels; and supplemental Fig. S1, fourth column of panels from the left) after 7–9 days, and 9–11 days, respectively. GFAP-positive cells appeared during days 9–11 of the RA-induced differentiation protocol (Fig. 1D, top set of panels; and supplemental Fig. S1, fifth column of panels from the left). GFAP is used as a glial marker protein and is also expressed in primate RG cells (28Hartfuss E. Galli R. Heins N. Gotz M. Dev. Biol. 2001; 229: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). However, when using the RA-dependent protocol, we did not detect RC2-positive staining (see supplemental Fig. S2), which is a characteristic of both primate and rodent RG cells in vivo (28Hartfuss E. Galli R. Heins N. Gotz M. Dev. Biol. 2001; 229: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). Because these RC2-/GFAP+ cells often showed astrocyte-specific star-like cell morphology (especially obvious in supplemental Fig. S1, bottom-right panel), it seems likely that most of the GFAP-positive cells in this culture condition were mature astrocytes. Upon 11 days of RA treatment, ∼34% (±3%) of the cells had differentiated into MAP2-positive neurons, whereas ∼15% (±7.5%) of the cells became GFAP-positive astrocytes (Fig. 1E). This period represents the terminal phase of neural differentiation (Fig. 1A). When cells were continuously exposed to 10% serum after stimulation by RA (Fig. 1A, indicated by +RA/+serum), instead of being cultured in serum-free neural medium, they did not undergo terminal differentiation but maintained the neural progenitor status that showed a high expression level of the neural progenitor marker Nestin (Fig. 1D, middle set of panels). In the absence of RA treatment (Fig. 1A, indicated by -RA), the cells did not lose their ability to express Oct3/4 and remained in an undifferentiated state in 10% serum-containing medium (Fig. 1, B and D, bottom set of panels). Cdc42 Is Necessary for the RA-dependent Up-regulation of Hes5 and Pax6 in P19 Cells and Neural Cell Differentiation—In P19 cells, the expression level of Cdc42 was dependent on the extent of cell-cell contact and was influenced by the state of confluency of the cells (supplemental Fig. S3). The formation of embryoid body-like aggregates caused a progressive increase in Cdc42 expression that started on days 2–4, regardless of the absence or presence of differentiation-inducing agents like RA and DMSO (Fig. 2A, top panel). We checked the Cdc42 activation status for each culture condition, as a read-out using GST-PBD pulldown assays. Cdc42 was effectively activated during RA-induced neural cell lineage specification (Fig. 2A, middle panel), compared with the weak activation observed with DMSO treatment, which induces myogenic cell lineages (see Fig. 2B), or the lack of detectable activation in undifferentiated cells (designated as “non-stimulated” in Fig. 2A, middle panel). These findings suggest that Cdc42 has specific functions in RA-dependent neural cell lineage specification. To determine if Cdc42 is in fact necessary for RA-dependent neural differentiation, we knocked down its expression using siRNA. Cells in which Cdc42 was knocked down still showed RA-dependent down-regulation of Oct3/4 expression at day 4 (Fig. 2C), indicating that Cdc42 was not necessary for this outcome. However, in Cdc42-siRNA-treated cells, the mRNA levels for Hes5 and Pax6 were significantly lower at day 4 (Fig. 2D). The effects of knocking down Cdc42 were sustained throughout the time period required for terminal differentiation, as indicated by the markedly reduced ability of RA to call-up the neuronal-specific markers, GAP43 and MAP2 (Fig. 2E). A significantly smaller percentage of Cdc42-siRNA-treated cells exhibited MAP2- or GFAP-staining as detected by fluorescence microscopy, compared with control-siRNA-treated cells (Fig. 2F and supplemental Fig. S4A). To determine whether knocking down Cdc42 simply delayed neural differentiation or blocked the ability of P19 cells to differentiate into neural cells, we extended the time period for differentiation from 11 to 15 days. This allowed the recovery of Cdc42 expression in the Cdc42-siRNA-treated cells (supplemental Fig. S4B). Nonetheless, significant differences in neural cell morphology and differentiation efficiencies, as a read-out by MAP2- and GFAP-staining, were still evident between control- and Cdc42-siRNA-treated cells (supplemental Figs. S4C and S4D). These results suggest that Cdc42 depletion does not simply delay RA-dependent neural differentiation but completely impairs it. Inhibitors of FGFR Kinase Activity and γ-Secretase Suppressed RA-induced Cdc42 Activation and Up-regulation of Hes5 and Pax6—The results described above suggest that Cdc42 depletion disrupts RA-dependent neural differentiation and that the impairment is already manifested during the time frame for the RA-dependent up-regulation of transcription fac"

These findings demonstrate cation exchange plasticity through hetero-CAX interactions. Calcium (Ca2+) is a cofactor for many enzymes, a vital signaling molecule and a structural component in providing the plant cell its strength (1Sanders D. Pelloux J. Brownlee C. Harper J.F. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 401-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar, 2Hirschi K.D. Plant Physiol. 2004; 136: 2438-2442Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Regulated Ca2+ fluctuations are presumably involved in every aspect of plant growth and adaptations. Ca2+ transporters on various membranes play an important role in orchestrating these diverse biological processes. Although a burgeoning number of Ca2+ transporters have been identified, it is often difficult to associate functions with particular transporters. Ca2+ can accumulate to millimolar levels in the vacuole, whereas the concentrations are maintained in the micromolar range in the cytosol (3Marty F. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 587-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). This concentration gradient is established across the tonoplast in part by high capacity Ca2+/H+ exchange and via Ca2+ pumping directly energized by ATP hydrolysis (4Schumaker K.S. Sze H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12172-12178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Sze H. Liang F. Hwang I. Curran A.C. Harper J.F. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 51: 433-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Plant Ca2+/H+ exchangers were cloned by the ability of N-terminal truncated versions of the proteins to function in Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants defective in vacuolar Ca2+ transport (6Hirschi K.D.

Plant Biol. 2006; 8: 419-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The term CAX (cation exchanger) is now used to identify CAX1 and CAX2 as well as four other CAX transporters in the Arabidopsis genome (9Shigaki T. Rees I. Nakhleh L. Hirschi K.D. J. Mol. Evol. 2006; 63: 815-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). N-terminal truncations of these transporters are termed sCAXs. Interestingly, CAX3 (and sCAX3), which is most similar to CAX1 (77% identical at the amino acid level), is at best a weak vacuolar Ca2+ transporter when expressed in yeast cells (10Shigaki T. Hirschi K.D. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 257: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 11Cheng N.H. Pittman J.K. Shigaki T. Lachmansingh J. LeClere S. Lahner B. Salt D.E. Hirschi K.D. Plant Physiol. 2005; 138: 2048-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Understanding of the biological roles these CAX transporters play in cell growth and in response to environmental stresses is only beginning to emerge. Interplay between CAX1 and CAX3 has been suggested through genetic studies and yeast expression assays (11Cheng N.H. Pittman J.K. Shigaki T. Lachmansingh J. LeClere S. Lahner B. Salt D.E. Hirschi K.D. Plant Physiol. 2005; 138: 2048-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In planta, deletions in CAX1 cause compensatory changes in gene expression among a battery of transporters, including heightened expression of CAX3 (12Cheng N.H. Pittman J.K. Barkla B.J. Shigaki T. Hirschi K.D. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 347-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Although cax1 and cax3 knock-out lines individually display subtle phenotypes, stunting and leaf chlorosis are readily apparent when both CAX1 and CAX3 are perturbed (11Cheng N.H. Pittman J.K. Shigaki T. Lachmansingh J. LeClere S. Lahner B. Salt D.E. Hirschi K.D. Plant Physiol. 2005; 138: 2048-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In yeast suppression assays, when autoinhibited versions of CAX1 and CAX3 are co-expressed in yeast mutant cells, there is measurable Ca2+/H+ exchange activity that is not present when these regulated transporters are expressed individually. The challenge is to delineate the nature and specificity of this association and determine how the action of endomembrane Ca2+/H+ antiporters is integrated into various biological processes. Frequently, transporters oligomerize to form pores. In some cases, the nature of the oligomer affects their function (13Ludewig U. Wilken S. Wu B. Jost W. Obrdlik P. El Bakkoury M. Marini A.M.

Recent work with ammonium transporters from Arabidopsis suggests that allosteric interactions between isoforms may be essential for activity (15Loqué D. Lalonde S. Looger L.L. von Wirén N. Frommer W.B. Nature. 2007; 446: 195-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In some cases, coupling between transporters may be a mechanism for increasing the dynamic range of transporter regulation and function. Here we detail the interaction between the Arabidopsis Ca2+/H+ exchangers CAX1 and CAX3. We demonstrate an interaction between CAX1 and CAX3 in planta and define this interaction using both plant and yeast assays. We conclude that CAX1 and CAX3 can be combined to form functional transporters with distinct transport properties. The cax1-1, cax3-1, cax3-2, and cax1/cax3 (cax1/3) lines are in the Arabidopsis ecotype Col-0 (11Cheng N.H. Pittman J.K. Shigaki T. Lachmansingh J. LeClere S. Lahner B. Salt D.E. Hirschi K.D.

Plant. 1962; 15: 473-497Crossref Scopus (53314) Google Scholar) agar plates (1.5% sucrose, 0.8% agar, pH 5.6) with or without CaCl2 (50 and 100 mm) or LiCl (0, 6, 10, and 15 mm). Plants were grown as previously described (17Zhao J. Barkla B.J. Marshall J. Pittman J.K. Hirschi K.D. Planta. 2008; 227: 659-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Germination was monitored daily, and at least three independent experiments (about 60 seeds in each experiment) were analyzed. Seeds with protruded radicles were regarded as germinated. Germination rate was expressed as a percentage of total sown seeds. Histochemical assays for CAX::GUS activity were performed according to the protocol described previously (11Cheng N.H. Pittman J.K.

These CAX::GUS seeds were germinated on one-half strength MS medium (18Murashige T. Skoog F. Physiol. Plant. 1962; 15: 473-497Crossref Scopus (53314) Google Scholar) and monitored daily. Samples were photographed using a Nikon (Tokyo, Japan) E600W microscope.

A. 2004; 101: 12242-12247Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Standard PCR conditions were used to amplify and clone CAX open reading frames into mbSUS vectors. The primers contained a B1 or B2 linker, and CAX1B1 (5′-ACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTCTCCAACCACCATGGCGGGAATCGTGACAGAG-3′) and CAX1B2 (5′-TCCGCCACCACCAACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTAAGATGAGAAAACTCCTCCTCC-3′) were used for full-length CAX1 amplification. Similarly, a pair of primers, CAX3B1 (5′-ACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTCTCCAACCACCATGGGAAGTATCGTGGAGCCA-3′) and CAX3B2 (5′-TCCGCCACCACCAACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTAAGCTGAGAAAACTTCTCCTCC-3′), were used for full-length CAX3 amplification. For the construction of NubX and NubWT fusions, the split ubiquitin vectors NubX and NubWT were cleaved with EcoRI/SmaI and mixed with the purified PCR products for CAX1, CAX3, N-CAX1, and C-CAX3 to transform THY.AP5 cells, and transformants were selected on SC medium lacking tryptophan and uracil. For Cub fusions, the vector metYCgate was cleaved with PstI/HindIII and mixed with the same PCR products to transform yeast strain THY.AP4, and transformants were selected on SC medium lacking leucine. After the initial interaction assay, plasmids were extracted from the yeast strains and amplified in E. coli. The interactions were then verified by repeating the assays using the purified plasmids, whose inserts were sequenced for confirmation. Microsomal membranes were extracted from Col-0, cax1-1, 35S::HA-CAX3-transgenic Arabidopsis plant leaves (3 weeks old). Tissues were ground to a fine powder in liquid nitrogen and resuspended in ice-cold extraction buffer: 50 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.6, 0.5 m sorbitol, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 1.5% polyvinylpyrrolidone 40,000, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and 1 mm DTT. The homogenate was filtered through four layers of cheesecloth and then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was diluted in 10% glycerol, 5 mm Tris-MES, pH 7.6, 1 mm PMSF, and 1 mm DTT and then centrifuged at 120,000 × g for 45 min.

After microsomal proteins were completely solubilized, samples were centrifuged at 4 °C to remove debris, and the supernatants were used for co-immunoprecipitation. Microsomal proteins were incubated with 20 μl of monoclonal mouse IgG against HA (Covance, Berkeley, CA) or 50 μl of CAX1 peptide antibody raised in rabbit against the N terminus of CAX1 (12Cheng N.H.

After four washings with CIP buffer and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) by centrifugation at 4 °C, 500 × g for 2 min, bound proteins in beads were eluted by boiling the beads in SDS sample-loading buffer, and proteins were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked with 5% milk in PBS-Tween 20 (PBST, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) at room temperature and incubated with primary antibodies, diluted in 2% milk in PBST (anti-HA at 1:2000, anti-V-ATPase at 1:1000, anti-CAX1 at 1:500, anti-TPC1 at 1:1000, anti-AVP1 at 1:3000, anti-TIP1;2 at 1:2000). Following washing, membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or -rabbit secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h and detected by chemiluminescence using an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences).

For detection of the CAX1-CAX3 complex in plants, the detergent-solubilized plant microsomal fractions were prepared as described above from 3-week-old 35S::HA-CAX3 transgenic seedlings with or without 15 mm LiCl for 8 h. As previously detailed, anti-CAX1 antibody was used to immunoprecipitate the CAX1-CAX3 protein complex. Extensively washed precipitates with CIP and PBST buffer were dissolved in protein loading buffer without DTT and resolved in native gel for PAGE. Similar to the yeast gel shift assay, after transfer to PVDF membrane, anti-HA and anti-CAX1 antibodies were used to detect protein complex formation. Suppression Assay—Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain K667 or WX1 was transformed with yeast expression constructs as described previously (21Shigaki T. Cheng N.-H. Pittman J.K. Hirschi K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43152-43159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Transformed cells were tested for their capability to suppress the K667 Ca2+-sensitive phenotype (6Hirschi K.D. Zhen R. Cunningham K.W. Rea P.A. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Growth assays using K667 cells were conducted using YPD medium supplemented with or without CaCl2 (50, 100, 150, or 200 mm), LiCl (30, 50, 60, or 100 mm), or NaCl (400, 500, or 600 mm). Lithium and CaCl2 plates were made in YPD agar medium. The LiCl stock solution was filter-sterilized and added to the autoclaved YPD agar medium to final concentrations of 30, 50, 70, or 100 mm. K667 cells expressing various constructs were grown in SC selection medium overnight at 30 °C. After a series of 5-fold dilutions with water, 5-μl cell suspensions were spotted on the indicated media, and the cells were grown for 3 days. A growth assay with the WX1 strain was conducted on AP medium (28Rodriguez-Navarro A. Ramos J. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 159: 940-945Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) supplemented with or without NaCl (20-60 mm), and drop tests were conducted as described above. For these assays, cells were grown at 30 °C for 4 days. Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectroscopy Analysis—Yeast culture conditions and sample processing were slightly modified from previous studies (29Eide D.J. Clark S. Nair T.M. Gehl M. Gribskov M. Guerinot M.L. Harper J.F. Genome Biol. 2005; 6: R77Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Mei H. Zhao J. Pittman J. Lachmansingh J. Park S. Hirschi K.D. J. Exp. Bot. 2007; 58: 3419-3427Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). For growth in Li+- and Ca2+-supplemented media, K667 cells expressing the various constructs were inoculated in 5 ml of YPD plus 1/100 volume of 100× mineral supplement stock (29Eide D.J. Clark S. Nair T.M. Gehl M. Gribskov M. Guerinot M.L. Harper J.F. Genome Biol. 2005; 6: R77Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), supplemented with 10 mm CaCl2 or 500 μm LiCl (final concentrations). For Na+ supplementation experiments, WX1 cells expressing the various constructs were inoculated in 5 ml of YPD supplemented with 100 mm NaCl (final concentration). The cultures were grown at 30 °C to stationary phase, and 2.5 ml of each culture was collected by vacuum filtration using isopore membrane filters (1.2-μm pore size) (Fisher). Cells were washed three times with 1 ml of 1 μm EDTA disodium salt solution, pH 8.0, by vacuum filtration, followed by three washes with 1 ml of distilled, deionized H2O. The filters were dried in a 70 °C oven for 48 h before inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy analysis was performed, as pervious described (31Lahner B. Gong J. Mahmoudian M. Smith E.L. Abid K.B. Rogers E.E. Guerinot M.L. Harper J.F. Ward J.M. McIntyre L. Schroeder J.I. Salt D.E. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 1215-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Data from five repeats were calculated with a formula, (ioncax - ionvector)/ionvector × 100, and expressed as means ± S.E. (n = 5). Microsomal fractions from yeast cells expressing CAX variants were prepared using the glass bead method (32Liang F. Cunningham K.W. Harper J.F. Sze H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8579-8584Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Briefly, glass bead buffer (25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 10% sucrose, 3 mm EGTA, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, 10 mm benzamidine, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin) was added to the cells with an equal volume of glass beads (Sigma), and the mixture was vortexed for 3 × 1 min at maximum speed with intervals of 10 min on ice. Finally, Triton X-100 was added to the lysate to a final concentration of 0.5%. The lysate was centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was saved. Equal amounts of protein (about 15 μg) from samples were resolved on native 12% PAGE with SDS-PAGE running buffer, followed by transferring membranes and immunoblotting as described above. Proteins were detected with HA, c-Myc, and GFP antibodies (Covance, Berkeley, CA). Transmembrane domains and topology of CAX1 and CAX3 were predicted using the ARAMEMNON data base (available on the World Wide Web) and the transmembrane hidden Markov model (TMHMM version 2.0) program. The split ubiquitin system used in this assay was a mating-based split ubiqutin system developed previously (23Obrdlik P. El-Bakkoury M. Hamacher T. Cappellaro C. Vilarino C. Fleischer C. Ellerbrok H. Kamuzinzi R. Ledent V. Blaudez D. Sanders D. Revuelta J.L. Boles E. André B. Frommer W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Approximately 40 clones of each THY.AP5 and THY.AP4 transformation with various Nub and Cub constructs were mixed and incubated in appropriate selective SC with and without G418. Cultures of the lag phase were used for mating, as described previously (13Ludewig U. Wilken S. Wu B. Jost W. Obrdlik P. El Bakkoury M. Marini A.M. André B. Hamacher T. Boles E. von Wirén N. Frommer W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45603-45610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). After mating THY.AP4 and THY.AP5 strains on YPD for 8 h of incubation at 28 °C, diploid cells were selected by replica plating on SC without tryptophan, leucine, and uracil for 2-3 days. Diploid cells were used to test on SC medium supplemented with 150 μm methionine for 3 days. After sequencing confirmation, these Nub and Cub constructs containing CAX1 and CAX3 constructs were used for retransformation, and the interaction assay was repeated using the confirmed Nub and Cub constructs. For the filter assay, diploid cells were grown for 3 days on sterilized filter sets placed on SC medium supplemented with His, adenine, and 150 μm methionine. β-Galactosidase activity assays were conducted according to the standard X-gal filter assay protocol described previously (23Obrdlik P. El-Bakkoury M. Hamacher T. Cappellaro C. Vilarino C. Fleischer C. Ellerbrok H. Kamuzinzi R. Ledent V. Blaudez D. Sanders D. Revuelta J.L. Boles E. André B. Frommer W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 12242-12247Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Color changes in the positive interactions could be detected within 3 h. Plants were grown hydroponically and membrane vesicles for yeast and plant Ca2+ uptake were performed as described previously (12Cheng N.H. Pittman J.K. Barkla B.J. Shigaki T. Hirschi K.D. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 347-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 21Shigaki T. Cheng N.-H. Pittman J.K. Hirschi K.D. J. Biol.

Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1020-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Three-week-old plants (mainly roots) were collected after 16 h of treatment with or without 100 mm CaCl2 (34Pittman J.K. Hirschi K.D. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1020-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). For the measurement of ΔpH-dependent Ca2+ uptake, vacuole-enriched membrane vesicles were incubated in buffer containing 0.3 m sorbitol, 5 mm Tris-MES (pH 7.6), 25 mm KCl, 0.1 mm sodium azide, and 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate. The vesicles were added to 1 mm MgSO4 and 1 mm ATP to reach steady state pH gradient for 5 min at 25 °C before the addition of 45Ca2+ (6 mCi/ml; American Radiolabeled Chemicals, St. Louis, MO). The final concentration of Ca2+ in the reaction mixture was 10 μm and 1 mm. At the indicated times, aliquots of the reaction mix were removed and filtered through premoistened 0.45-μm filters (Millipore, Bedford, MA), followed by washing with 1 ml of ice-cold wash buffer (0.3 m sorbitol, 5 mm Tris-MES, pH 7.6, 25 mm KCl, and 0.1 mm CaCl2), the filters were air-dried, and radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. For metal competition experiments, ΔpH-dependent 10 μm 45Ca2+ uptake was measured at a 10 min time point in the presence of 100 μm or 1 mm nonradioactive metals. For testing CAX1 and CAX3 expression, Col-0 seeds were analyzed at different times during germination. For LiCl induction, germinating seeds on day 4 were treated with 15 mm LiCl, and seedling RNA was extracted 8, 16, and 24 h post-treatment. For CAX1 expression in cax1-1, Col-0, and 35S::HA-CAX3 transgenic plants, roots of 3-week-old plants grown hydroponically in B5 medium were harvested for RNA extraction. Total RNA was extracted with the RNeasy plant minikit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). First strand cDNA was synthesized with Superscript II RNase H-reverse transcriptase kit with oligo(dT)12-18 primer (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR was performed with the following program: 94 °C for 2 min to denature DNA and then from 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, to 72 °C for 30 s for 22, 25, or 30 cycles, followed by 72 °C for a 10-min extension. ACTIN1 expression was used as internal control. For CAX1, forward primer was 5′-GCG TTA ATT AAG GCG CGC CTT CCG GCC ATA CCT GCC GCC A-3′, and reverse primer was 5′-GCG GGA TCC ATT TAA ATC ACC GCG GTT TCT TGC TCC AC-3′. For CAX3, forward primer was 5′-GCG TTA ATT AAG GCG CGC CCA TGG GAG AAC AGC ACA CAA C-3′, and reverse primer was 5′-GCG GGA TCC ATT TAA ATC CGC GAC AGA GTG AGC GAC AT-3′. For ACTIN1, forward primer was 5′-GTGCTCGACTCTGGAGATGGTGTG-3′, and reverse primer was 5′-CGGCGATTCCAGGGAACATTGTGG-3′. Phenotypes When Co-expressing CAX1 and CAX3 in Yeast—We demonstrated previously that co-expression of CAX1 and CAX3 can suppress yeast vacuolar Ca2+ transport defects, whereas expression of either transporter individually failed to do so (11Cheng N.H. Pittman J.K. Shigaki T. Lachmansingh J. LeClere S. Lahner B. Salt D.E. Hirschi K.D. Plant Physiol. 2005; 138: 2048-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In fact, in yeast assays, we have never been able to measure Ca2+/H+ transport mediated by CAX1 or CAX3. Expression of the deregulated version of CAX1, sCAX1, confers high levels of Ca2+/H+ transport; however, we have not yet isolated a deregulated version of CAX3 that functions as a Ca2+/H+ transporter. In the present study, we were interested in the potential change in substrate specificity that might occur during the putative CAX1 and CAX3 association. As shown in Fig. 1, co-expression of CAX1 and CAX3 could produce Li+ tolerance, a phenotype that was not observed when deregulated versions of the transporters were expressed individually (Fig. 1A). Data suggest that both proteins localize to the yeast vacuole (supplemental Fig. 1), and we have previously shown equivalent expression levels of these transporters in yeast (10Shigaki T. Hirschi K.D. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 257: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 21Shigaki T. Cheng N.-H. Pittman J.K. Hirschi K.D. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1997576072,"Previous studies have shown that the type I collagen of tendon and demineralized bone both calcify rapidly in serum. The speed, collagen matrix-type specificity, and extent of the re-calcification of demineralized bone in serum suggest that the serum calcification activity identified in these studies may participate in normal biomineralization. Because of its presence in serum and its long history of association with the normal mineralization of the collagen matrix of bone, tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) is an obvious candidate for a protein that could be a component of serum calcification activity, and experiments were therefore carried out to test this possibility. These experiments show that the inactivation of TNAP in serum prevents collagen calcification, and that the addition of physiological levels of purified TNAP restores the ability of TNAP-deficient serum to calcify collagen. Additional experiments show that the role of TNAP in collagen calcification is to activate a serum nucleator of apatite crystal formation. Based on these and earlier studies, the mechanism of collagen calcification in serum requires at least four elements as follows. 1) A matrix (collagen fibrils) that is accessible to small apatite crystals but not large molecules (Toroian, D., Lim, J. E., and Price, P. A. (2007) J. Biol. Chem. 282, 22437-22447). 2) A large serum nucleator that generates small crystals, some of which diffuse into the fibrils. 3) A source of TNAP to activate the serum nucleator. 4) A large protein (fetuin) that selectively inhibits growth of crystals remaining in solution, thereby ensuring that only crystals within fibrils grow (Toroian, D. T., and Price, P. A. (2008) Calcif. Tissue Int. 82, 116-126). Previous studies have shown that the type I collagen of tendon and demineralized bone both calcify rapidly in serum.

In the course of our investigations, we have discovered that purified type I collagen and demineralized bone matrix both calcify rapidly when incubated in serum in the absence of cells (1Hamlin N.J.

The calcification of collagen is because of the presence of a serum calcification activity, one sufficiently potent that collagen calcifies when incubated in media containing as little as 1.5% serum but not in serum-free media alone (1Hamlin N.J. Price P.A. Calcif. Tissue Int. 2004; 75: 231-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 2Hamlin N.J. Ong K.G. Price P.A. Calcif.

Biol. 2006; 26: 1079-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).Although serum-driven collagen calcification is an in vitro, cell-free assay, there are several reasons to believe that it could be relevant to understanding mechanisms by which collagen fibrils are mineralized in nature. 1) The assay conditions are physiologically relevant; collagen added to serum calcifies when incubated at the temperature and pH of mammalian blood, without the need to add anything to serum to promote mineralization, such as β-glycerophosphate or phosphate (see Ref. 1Hamlin N.J. Price P.A. Calcif. Tissue Int. 2004; 75: 231-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar and references therein). 2) Serum is relevant to bone mineralization; osteoblasts form bone in a vascular compartment (5Parfitt A.M. Bone (Elmsford). 2000; 26: 319-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), and proteins in serum have direct access to the site of collagen fibril formation and mineralization, whereas proteins secreted by the osteoblast appear rapidly in serum. 3) Serum-driven calcification is evolutionarily conserved; the serum calcification activity appeared in animals at the time vertebrates acquired the ability to form calcium phosphate mineral structures, with no evidence for a similar activity in the serum of invertebrates (2Hamlin N.J. Ong K.G. Price P.A. Calcif. Tissue Int. 2006; 76: 326-334Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). 4) Serum-driven calcification is specific; calcification is restricted to those structures that were calcified in bone prior to demineralization, with no evidence of calcification in cartilage at the bone ends or in cell debris (1Hamlin N.J. Price P.A. Calcif. Tissue Int. 2004; 75: 231-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 3Price P.A. June H.H. Hamlin N.J. Williamson M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19169-19180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). 5) Serum-driven calcification can achieve the total re-calcification of demineralized bone;: serum-driven calcification progresses until the re-calcified bone is comparable with the original bone in mineral content and composition, radiographic density, and powder x-ray diffraction spectrum (3Price P.A. June H.H. Hamlin N.J. Williamson M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19169-19180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).We have recently published two studies on the mechanism of serum-induced calcification of collagen fibrils (6Toroian D.T. Price P.A. Calcif. Tissue Int. 2008; 82: 116-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 7Toroian D. Lim J.E. Price P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 22437-22447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The collagen fibril is about 70% water by volume (8Fullerton G. Amurao M. Cell Biol. Int. 2006; 30: 56-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and during mineralization the water within the fibril is replaced by mineral (9Blitz R.M. Pellegrino E.D. J. Bone Jt. Surg. Am. 1969; 51: 456-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 10Boivin G. Meunier P. Calcif. Tissue Int. 2002; 70: 503-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 11Robinson R.A. Elliott S.R. J. Bone Jt. Surg. Am. 1957; 39: 167-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Our first study demonstrated that the water within the fibril is accessible to molecules and apatite crystals as large as a 6-kDa protein, and is inaccessible to molecules larger than a 40-kDa protein (7Toroian D. Lim J.E. Price P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 22437-22447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Our second study showed that fetuin, a 48-kDa serum inhibitor of mineral growth (12Price P.A. Lim J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22144-22152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 13Schinke T. Amendt C. Trindl A. Poschke O. Muller-Esterl W. Jahnen-Dechent W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20789-20796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), determines the location in which the apatite crystals generated by the serum calcification activity can grow; in the absence of fetuin mineral grows in the solution outside collagen fibrils, whereas in the presence of fetuin mineral grows exclusively within collagen fibrils (6Toroian D.T. Price P.A. Calcif. Tissue Int. 2008; 82: 116-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).The results of these studies show that the mechanism of serum-induced calcification requires at least three elements as follows: 1) a matrix with an interior aqueous compartment that is accessible to small apatite crystals but not large molecules; 2) a large nucleator (not yet identified) that generates small crystals outside of the matrix, some of which diffuse into the matrix; and 3) a large protein (fetuin) that selectively inhibits the growth of those crystals remaining in solution outside the matrix, thereby ensuring that only crystals within the matrix grow. We have proposed the term “shotgun mineralization” for this calcification mechanism (6Toroian D.T. Price P.A. Calcif. Tissue Int. 2008; 82: 116-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar); crystals form throughout the solution, and only those that diffuse into a matrix grow.Among the known serum proteins, tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) 2The abbreviations used are: TNAP, tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase or bone/liver/kidney alkaline phosphatase; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; NBCS, newborn calf serum. 2The abbreviations used are: TNAP, tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase or bone/liver/kidney alkaline phosphatase; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; NBCS, newborn calf serum. is arguably the most obvious candidate for a protein that could be a component of serum calcification activity. TNAP has a long and extensive history of association with normal bone calcification (14Whyte M.P. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 439-461PubMed Google Scholar), and the molecular masses of the different glycosylated forms of the serum enzyme range from 126 to 141 kDa (15Magnusson P. Farley J.R. Calcif. Tissue Int. 2002; 71: 508-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), which is within the molecular mass range expected for serum calcification activity (3Price P.A. June H.H. Hamlin N.J. Williamson M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19169-19180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Serum TNAP consists of approximately equal amounts of the bone and liver isoforms of the enzyme. These isoforms have the same protein sequence but differ in O-linked glycosylation (22Magnusson P. Artestig L. Paus E. DiMauro S. Testa M.P. Stigbrand T. Farley J.R. Nustad K. Millan J.L. Tumor Biol. 2002; 23: 228-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase is a zinc metalloenzyme that hydrolyzes a broad range of phosphate monoesters, but its normal physiological substrate is presently unclear (14Whyte M.P. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 439-461PubMed Google Scholar). As its name implies, tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase is expressed in a wide variety of tissues, tissues that include bone, liver, and kidney (14Whyte M.P. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 439-461PubMed Google Scholar). Despite its nonspecific expression in tissues, however, genetic deficiency in tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase in mice and humans (called hypophosphatasia) is primarily associated with defects in bone mineralization (14Whyte M.P. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 439-461PubMed Google Scholar, 16Fedde K.N. Blair L. Silverstein J. Coburn S.P. Ryan L.M. Weinstein R.S. Waymire K. Narisawa S. Millan J.L. MacGregor G.R. Whyte M.P. J.

This observation, together with abundant expression of alkaline phosphatase at sites of bone mineralization (18Robison R. Biochem. J. 1923; 17: 286-293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Robison R. Soames K.M. Biochem. J. 1924; 18: 740-754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in association with the outer surface of osteoblasts (20Doty S.B. Schofield B. Prog. Histochem.

Cytochem. 1971; 19: 801-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), supports a probable role of the enzyme in normal bone mineralization.The present experiments were carried out to determine whether the endogenous tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase found in serum is a component of serum calcification activity. The results of these experiments show that TNAP is an essential component of serum calcification activity and that its role in the Shotgun Mechanism is to activate the serum nucleator of apatite crystal formation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Bovine bone sand was prepared from the mid-shaft of bovine cortical bone as described (23Hale J.E.

The bone sand was sized to obtain particles that pass through a 0.43-mm (35 mesh) sieve and are retained by a 0.25-mm (60 mesh) sieve, demineralized by extraction for 72 h with 0.5 m EDTA pH 7.5, and then washed exhaustively with water and dried. Tibias were dissected from newborn rats, demineralized in 0.5 m EDTA, pH 7.5, for 72 h at room temperature using a 300-fold molar excess of EDTA to mineral calcium, washed exhaustively with ultra pure water to remove all traces of EDTA, and stored at -20 °C until use (3Price P.A.

Bovine kidney alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) with a specific activity of 1000 units/mg was obtained from Calzyme Laboratories (San Luis Obispo, CA); beryllium sulfate tetrahydrate was from Fluka; and (-)-tetramisole hydrochloride (levamisole), 1,10-phenanthroline monohydrate, purified bovine milk casein, purified type I collagen from bovine achilles tendon, and Alizarin red S were from Sigma. Newborn calf serum was purchased from Invitrogen and had a basal alkaline phosphatase activity of 0.2 unit/ml. A single batch of newborn calf serum was used for all experiments to eliminate serum as a possible variable. DMEM was prepared by supplementing each 500-ml volume of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with 5 ml of penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen), 1 ml of 10% sodium azide, and 1.1 ml of 0.5 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 (final medium Pi concentration = 2 mm).Experiments with Neat Serum—In a typical re-calcification experiment, 4 mg of demineralized bovine bone sand (dry weight) was re-hydrated in water, placed in 2 ml of newborn calf serum in a 24-well plate (Costar 3524), and incubated in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 7.5% CO2 with continuous, gentle mixing using a plate shaker. In the calcification time course experiment (Fig. 1), three wells contained 4 mg of bone sand in 2 ml of newborn calf serum (NBCS); three wells contained bone sand in NBCS plus 10 units/ml TNAP; three wells contained bone sand in NBCS plus 30 mm levamisole; three wells contained bone sand in NBCS plus 30 μm beryllium sulfate; and three wells contained NBCS alone. At t = 0 and every 12 h thereafter, 25 μl were removed from every well, combined with 25 μl of 150 mm HCl, and analyzed for calcium; calcium uptake was determined from the decrease in serum calcium because of the presence of bone sand. To test the effect of added TNAP on calcification of different matrices (supplemental Fig. A), rat tail tendon segments and single demineralized newborn rat tibias were each separately incubated for 36 h in 2-ml volumes of NBCS and of NBCS containing 10 units/ml TNAP. To determine the effect of alkaline phosphatase inhibitors on bone re-calcification in serum, 4 mg of demineralized bone sand was incubated for 72 h in 2 ml of NBCS containing the indicated concentrations of beryllium (supplemental Fig. B), levamisole (supplemental Fig. C), and 1,10-phenanthroline (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2Dose-dependent inhibition of bone re-calcification in serum by the irreversible alkaline phosphatase inhibitor 1,10-phenanthroline. Four-milligram samples of dry, demineralized calf bone sand were re-hydrated in water and incubated for 72 h at 37 °C in 2 -ml aliquots of newborn calf serum containing the indicated concentrations of the zinc chelator 1,10-phenanthroline, an irreversible TNAP inhibitor. Each bone sample was first stained with Alizarin red and then analyzed for calcium and phosphate (see “Experimental Procedures”); the alkaline phosphatase activity remaining in serum was also measured at each 1,10-phenanthroline dose. The graph shows the calcium and phosphate incorporated into bone sand at each 1,10-phenanthroline dose and the alkaline phosphatase activity remaining in serum after the 72-h incubation (○). As can be seen, the 1 and 3 mm doses of 1,10-phenanthroline completely abolished alkaline phosphatase activity and prevented uptake of calcium and phosphate; these doses also completely prevented Alizarin red staining (data not shown), although lower doses did not.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To separately assess the effects of alkaline phosphatase inhibitors on the initiation and growth of calcification in demineralized bone (Fig. 3), a 24-h preincubation in serum was used to introduce mineral foci within the collagenous matrix, and a subsequent incubation for 5 days in DMEM without serum was used to foster growth of the initial crystal nuclei, using procedures that have been described elsewhere (3Price P.A.

Alkaline phosphatase inhibitors were added at the serum initiation stage or at the DMEM growth stage.FIGURE 3Evidence that alkaline phosphatase inhibitors prevent initiation of bone re-calcification by serum but do not prevent subsequent crystal growth. Demineralized newborn rat tibias were separately incubated for 24 h in 2-ml aliquots of newborn calf serum, or serum containing either 10 μm beryllium sulfate, 10 mm levamisole, or 1 mm 1,10-phenanthroline. Two of the tibias incubated in serum alone were removed and stained with Alizarin red. All other tibias were removed from serum, rinsed twice with 10 ml of DMEM, and then incubated for 5 days in 10 ml of DMEM or 10 ml of DMEM containing either 10 μm beryllium sulfate, 10 mm levamisole, or 1 mm 1,10-phenanthroline. Tibias were stained with Alizarin red and then analyzed for calcium and phosphate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Experiments with TNAP-deficient Serum in DMEM—Serum deficient in alkaline phosphatase activity was prepared using 1,10-phenanthroline, a zinc chelator that irreversibly inactivates the enzyme (24Stinson R.A. McPhee J.L. Collier H.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 913: 272-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In a typical experiment, 150 μl of 1 m phenanthroline in methanol was combined with 10 ml of newborn calf serum in a 15-ml conical tube, and the tube was loosely capped and placed for 72 h in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 7.5% CO2. The serum was then placed into dialysis tubing (molecular mass cut-off of 6-8 kDa) and dialyzed against four changes of 125 ml of DMEM each using the same incubator. The same dialysis procedure was also used to remove any non-protein associated zinc from the TNAP solution. Control serum was prepared by the same procedure using methanol vehicle alone. TNAP activity-deficient and control serum samples were frozen until use.Experiments to examine the effect of TNAP depletion on the calcification of collagen matrices were carried out using 24-well cell culture clusters (Costar 3524, Corning Glass) in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Each well contained 2 ml of DMEM with 2 mm Pi and 1% by volume of one of the following: control newborn calf serum; alkaline phosphatase-depleted serum; or alkaline phosphatase-depleted serum + 0.2 unit/ml of purified TNAP (see Table 3). The amount of matrix added to each 2-ml volume was as follows: a single hydrated, demineralized newborn rat tibia or a portion of purified type I collagen from bovine achilles tendon (3 mg dry weight; hydrated before use). Each tissue was then incubated for 6 days.TABLE 3The alkaline phosphatase activity in the serum samples used in these studiesSampleAlkaline phosphatase activityunits/mlControl serum0.18 ± 0.03Alkaline phosphatase-depleted serum<0.002Alkaline phosphatase-depleted serum + 0.2 unit/ml purified TNAP0.22 ± 0.03 Open table in a new tab Experiments with Fetuin-deficient Serum in DMEM—Fetuin-depleted serum was prepared as described previously (6Toroian D.T. Price P.A. Calcif. Tissue Int. 2008; 82: 116-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In brief, a column packed with rabbit anti-bovine fetuin antibodies conjugated to Sepharose 4B was equilibrated with DMEM, and adult bovine serum was dialyzed against the same solution. The dialyzed bovine serum was then freed of fetuin by passing a 0.85-ml serum aliquot over the column at room temperature. The absorbance at 280 nm of each 1-ml fraction was determined; the four fractions with the highest absorbance were then pooled and diluted with DMEM until the absorbance equaled that of 10% bovine serum. Protein bound to the column was removed by washing the column with 100 mm glycine, pH 2.5. The effect of alkaline phosphatase and its inhibitors on apatite crystal formation in DMEM containing 10% fetuin-depleted serum was carried out using 24-well cell culture clusters in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 (see Ref. 6Toroian D.T. Price P.A. Calcif. Tissue Int. 2008; 82: 116-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).Biochemical Analyses—The procedures used for Alizarin red and von Kossa staining have been described (1Hamlin N.J. Price P.A. Calcif. Tissue Int. 2004; 75: 231-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). For quantitative assessment of mineral formation, matrices and precipitates were extracted for 24 h at room temperature with 1 ml of 0.15 m HCl. Calcium levels were determined colorimetrically using cresolphthalein complexone (JAS Diagnostics, Inc., Miami, FL), and phosphate levels were determined as described (25Chen P.S. Toribara T.Y. Warner H. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 1756-1758Crossref Scopus (5819) Google Scholar). Alkaline phosphatase activity was measured at pH 10.4 using p-nitrophenol phosphate as substrate (JAS Diagnostics).RESULTSEvidence That the Addition of Alkaline Phosphatase Accelerates the Rate of Collagen Calcification in Serum—TNAP is abundantly expressed at sites of bone mineralization (18Robison R. Biochem. J. 1923; 17: 286-293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Robison R. Soames K.M. Biochem. J. 1924; 18: 740-754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), where it is held in the external leaflet of osteoblast plasma membrane by a hydrophobic glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor (32Ferguson M.A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2799-2809Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the local concentration of the enzyme near the osteoblast plasma membrane is likely to be far higher than the 0.2 unit/ml of alkaline phosphatase activity found in calf serum. As a first step in evaluating the effect of high local concentrations of TNAP on serum-induced collagen calcification, we investigated the impact of adding 10 units/ml of purified TNAP on the rate of bone re-calcification in new born calf serum at 37 °C and pH 7.4. Demineralized bovine bone sand was used for this test to increase the ratio of matrix surface to volume and thereby enhance the diffusion of calcium, phosphate, or small crystals into collagen. In the 2-ml serum volume used for this test, there is only sufficient calcium and phosphate to restore ∼5% of the mineral that was present in the bone sand prior to demineralization.Fig. 1 shows that the addition of purified bovine TNAP to serum markedly accelerates the rate at which serum calcium is taken up by bone in this experimental system, with half-maximal calcium uptake at 38 h in serum plus TNAP compared with 60 h in serum alone. The results of a repeat experiment were similar, with half-maximal calcium uptake at 40 h in serum plus added TNAP compared with 64 h in serum alone (data not shown). Although the addition of TNAP substantially accelerates the re-calcification of bone in serum, it does not significantly affect the amount of calcium taken up by bone after 6 days of incubation (Fig. 1) or the total calcium and phosphate recovered from the re-calcified bone (Table 1). This result may reflect the effects of calcium and phosphate depletion during the 6-day incubation on the final extent of mineral formation in collagen, because most of the calcium and phosphate initially in the 2-ml serum aliquot has been deposited in bone by the 6-day time point. Previous studies have shown that the initial step in serum-induced apatite formation is highly dependent on the concentration of calcium and phosphate in solution, and will not continue to occur when the calcium phosphate ion product falls below about 2.5 mm3 (1Hamlin N.J. Price P.A. Calcif. Tissue Int. 2004; 75: 231-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 2Hamlin N.J. Ong K.G. Price P.A. Calcif.

Chem. 1976; 22: 972-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar)) completely prevented the uptake of serum calcium by bone, and Table 1 shows that bone samples incubated in serum with either beryllium or levamisole had no detectable calcium or phosphate, and did not stain with Alizarin red.A potentially trivial explanation for the effect of alkaline phosphatase on the kinetics of bone re-calcification in serum is that the enzyme could liberate sufficient phosphate from serum substrates to increase total ionic phosphate levels in serum and that this increase could accelerate the re-calcification of demineralized bone. To test this possibility, serum containing the 10 units/ml level of added TNAP was incubated for 9 days at 37 °C in the absence of bone matrix. As can be seen in Table 2, serum phosphate levels were not increased by the 9-day incubation with TNAP and were also not affected by the addition of alkaline phosphatase inhibitors. This experiment shows that any substrate hydrolysis that may occur during the 9-day incubation with alkaline phosphatase is not sufficient to produce a detectable increase in total ionic phosphate levels in serum.TABLE 2Effect of alkaline phosphatase and of alkaline phosphatase inhibitors on serum phosphate levels after incubat"
https://openalex.org/W2095428873,"Members of the carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase family catalyze the oxidative cleavage of carotenoids at various chain positions, leading to the formation of a wide range of apocarotenoid signaling molecules. To explore the functions of this diverse enzyme family, we have used a chemical genetic approach to design selective inhibitors for different classes of carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase. A set of 18 arylalkyl-hydroxamic acids was synthesized in which the distance between an iron-chelating hydroxamic acid and an aromatic ring was varied; these compounds were screened as inhibitors of four different enzyme classes, either in vitro or in vivo. Potent inhibitors were found that selectively inhibited enzymes that cleave carotenoids at the 9,10 position; 50% inhibition was achieved at submicromolar concentrations. Application of certain inhibitors at 100 microm to Arabidopsis node explants or whole plants led to increased shoot branching, consistent with inhibition of 9,10-cleavage."
https://openalex.org/W2052335501,"ATR is a protein kinase that orchestrates the cellular response to replication problems and DNA damage. HCLK2 has previously been reported to stabilize ATR and Chk1. Here we provide evidence that human HCLK2 acts at an early step in the ATR signaling pathway and contributes to full-scale activation of ATR kinase activity. We show that HCLK2 forms a complex with ATR-ATRIP and the ATR activator TopBP1. We demonstrate that HCLK2-induced ATR kinase activity toward substrates requires TopBP1 and vice versa and provides evidence that HCLK2 facilitates efficient ATR-TopBP1 association. Consistent with its role in ATR activation, HCLK2 depletion severely impaired phosphorylation of multiple ATR targets including Chk1, Nbs1, and Smc1 after DNA damage. We show that HCLK2 is required for and stimulates ATR autophosphorylation and activity toward different substrates in vitro. Furthermore, HCLK2 depletion abrogated the G2 checkpoint and decreased survival of cells after exposure to DNA damaging agents and replicative stress. Overall, our data suggest that HCLK2 facilitates ATR activation and, therefore, contributes to ATR-mediated checkpoint signaling. Importantly, our results suggest that HCLK2 functions in the same pathway as TopBP1 but that the two proteins regulate different steps in ATR activation.

In response to DNA damage and replication stress, genomic integrity is protected by coordinated activation of the genome surveillance pathways, including cell cycle checkpoints, DNA repair, and chromatin remodeling (1Zhou B.B. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (2633) Google Scholar). The DNA damage checkpoint cascade involves several unique and overlapping factors, classified as sensors, mediators, transducer, and effectors, that upon activation lead to the spatiotemporal assembly of multiprotein complexes at the sites of damage (2Bekker-Jensen S. Lukas C. Kitagawa R. Melander F. Kastan M.B. Bartek J. Lukas J. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Failure in checkpoint signaling can result in genome instability and pre-dispose to cancer. DNA damage checkpoints operate at the G1-S and G2-M transitions and within the S phase of the cell cycle (3Kastan M.B. Bartek J. Nature. 2004; 432: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (2197) Google Scholar). The master regulators of the checkpoints are the two phosphoinositide 3-kinase-related protein kinases ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) 3The abbreviations used are: ATM, ataxia-telangiectasia mutated; ATR, ataxia-telangietascia and Rad3-related; TopBP1, topoisomerase II-binding protein 1; Gy, gray; sh-, short hairpin; siRNA, small interfering RNA; GST, glutathione S-transferase. 3The abbreviations used are: ATM, ataxia-telangiectasia mutated; ATR, ataxia-telangietascia and Rad3-related; TopBP1, topoisomerase II-binding protein 1; Gy, gray; sh-, short hairpin; siRNA, small interfering RNA; GST, glutathione S-transferase. and ataxia-telangietascia and Rad3-related (ATR). Although ATM is mainly important for the response to DNA double-stranded breaks, ATR responds to a wide variety of DNA damage lesions and replication stress. ATR is activated by single-stranded DNA, which can be generated by replication intermediates or during processing of DNA lesions. The single-stranded DNA is recognized and coated by replication protein A, which subsequently recruits the ATR-ATRIP complex (4Zhao H. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4129-4139Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar, 5Zou L. Elledge S.J. Science. 2003; 300: 1542-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (2045) Google Scholar). Upon activation, ATR phosphorylates various downstream targets including Smc1, Nbs1, and Chk1, which in turn are responsible for coordinating cell cycle progression and DNA repair (4Zhao H. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4129-4139Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar, 6Liu S. Bekker-Jensen S. Mailand N. Lukas C. Bartek J. Lukas J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 6056-6064Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). ATR activation and phosphorylation of targets has been shown to require DNA topoisomerase II-binding protein 1 (TopBP1). In addition, phosphorylation of the downstream effector kinase Chk1 requires another mediator, Claspin (6Liu S. Bekker-Jensen S. Mailand N. Lukas C. Bartek J. Lukas J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 6056-6064Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 7Garcia V. Furuya K. Carr A.M. DNA Repair (Amst). 2005; 4: 1227-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 8Kumagai A.

Activation of Chk1 is crucial for efficient genome surveillance during S or G2 phase of the cell cycle. Chk1 phosphorylates and inhibits the activity of the Cdc25 phosphatases. Cdc25s regulate cell cycle progression by activating cyclin-dependent kinases. Inhibition of Cdc25s has been implicated in the control of G1, S, and G2 DNA damage checkpoints (9Sanchez Y. Wong C. Thoma R.S. Richman R. Wu Z. Piwnica-Worms H. Elledge S.J. Science. 1997; 277: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar). Recently, much attention has been drawn to HCLK2 and its orthologs. It is an essential gene conserved throughout eukaryotes. Evidence from several organisms has indicated a role of HCLK2 and its orthologs in the DNA damage response. In Caenorhabditis elegans, two mutants (rad-5 and clk-2) were isolated with increased sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents and prolonged life span, respectively (10Lakowski B. Hekimi S. Science. 1996; 272: 1010-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 11Hartman P.S. Herman R.K. Genetics. 1982; 102: 159-178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Later, it was shown that rad-5 was allelic to clk-2, and cloning of the gene revealed that it encodes a protein homologous to Saccharomyces cerevisiae Tel2 and human HCLK2 (12Ahmed S. Alpi A. Hengartner M.O. Gartner A. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1934-1944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 13Benard C. McCright B. Zhang Y. Felkai S. Lakowski B. Hekimi S. Development. 2001; 128: 4045-4055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Clk-2 is not required for recruitment of ATL-1 (C. elegans ATR) to sites of damage, which is consistent with what has later been shown in human cells (14Garcia-Muse T. Boulton S.J. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4345-4355Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 15Collis S.J. Barber L.J. Clark A.J. Martin J.S. Ward J.D. Boulton S.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In human cells a physical association between HCLK2 and ATR-ATRIP and Chk1 has been identified, and HCLK2 was shown to be critical for the S-phase checkpoint possibly via stabilization of Chk1. In addition, depletion of HCLK2 impaired monoubiquitination of FANCD2 and homologous recombination (15Collis S.J. Barber L.J. Clark A.J. Martin J.S. Ward J.D. Boulton S.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The Schizosaccharomyces pombe HCLK2 ortholog (Tel2p) is required for activation of the Mrc1 (a Claspin homologue)-mediated checkpoint in response to hydroxyurea, and in S. cerevisiae tel2 mutants have short telomeres, and Tel2 has been suggested to play a role in the activation and localization of Tel1 (ATM) to double-stranded breaks (16Shikata M.

Blackburn E.H. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 854-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). HCLK2/Tel2 has been shown to interact with the family of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-like kinases (18Takai H. Wang R.C. Takai K.K. Yang H. de Lange T. Cell. 2007; 131: 1248-1259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 19Hayashi T. Hatanaka M. Nagao K. Nakaseko Y. Kanoh J. Kokubu A. Ebe M. Yanagida M. Genes Cells. 2007; 12: 1357-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), and in human and mouse this interaction has been suggested to stabilize the phosphoinositide 3-kinase-related protein kinases, thereby providing another layer of HCLK2-mediated regulation of the DDR (18Takai H. Wang R.C. Takai K.K. Yang H. de Lange T. Cell. 2007; 131: 1248-1259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Here, we report that in addition to previous findings, HCLK2 modulates the ATR-mediated checkpoint signaling very rapidly, already before an effect on ATR protein levels can be observed. This is accompanied by a decrease in ATR autophosphorylation and activity toward substrates in the absence of HCLK2. We demonstrate that HCLK2-induced ATR activity requires TopBP1 and vice versa. However, ATR autophosphorylation appears independent on TopBP1. Furthermore, we identify the region of HCLK2 required for association with ATR and TopBP1. Our data indicates that HCLK2 modulates ATR activity by promoting ATR-TopBP1 interaction and, thus, support the emerging evidence that HCLK2 is a bona fide component of the ATR activation machinery. Cell Culture and DNA-damaging Treatments—Human U-2-OS, HEK 293T, and HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Transfection of siRNAs was performed using Lipofectamine RNAi MAX (Invitrogen). For stable and transient DNA transfections, we used FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to manufacturer's instructions. For generation of the stable shATR cell line with inducible small hairpin RNA expression, naive U-2-OS cells were transfected with shATR vector and a plasmid encoding the tetracycline repressor for 24 h and selected with puromycin (1 μg/ml; Sigma) and blasticidin (5 μg/ml; InvivoGen). Expression of the small hairpin RNA was achieved by incubating the cells with 2 μg/ml of doxycycline (BD Biosciences) for 72 h. Cells were exposed to ionizing radiation using an x-ray generator (Pantak HF160, 150hV, 16mA, dose rate of 2.18 Gy/min). Exposure to UV light was performed with a Stratalinker 1800 (Stratagene). To induce replication fork stalling, 2 mm hydroxyurea (Sigma) was added to the cells for 1 h. ATM inhibitor (KU55933, KuDOS pharmaceuticals) was used at a final concentration of 1 μm. Plasmids and siRNA—The expression plasmids for HCLK2 were generated by inserting PCR-amplified HCLK2 cDNA (full-length and various fragments) in-frame with a FLAG tag into pFLAG-CMV-2 (Sigma). siRNA from Dharmacon were used to transiently down-regulate the expression of TopBP1 (5′-GUGGUUGUAACAGCGCAUC-3′), ATRIP (5′-AGAGAAACUGUUCCAAUUA-3′), and ATR (5′-TGAACTGTACGTGGAAAGG-3′). For down-regulation of HCLK2 we applied a previously published siRNA SmartPool from Dharmacon (15Collis S.J. Barber L.J. Clark A.J. Martin J.S. Ward J.D. Boulton S.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). As a control, a previously described siRNA against HSP70B (used in U-2-OS cells) and RISCFree siRNA (in HeLa cells), both from Dharmacon, were applied (20Bekker-Jensen S. Lukas C. Melander F. Bartek J. Lukas J. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). An inducible small hairpin RNA expression vector targeting ATR was generated by annealing oligonucleotides (target sequence: 5′-TGAACTGTACGTGGAAAGG-3′) and ligating the fragment into BglII/HindIII-digested pSUPERIOR vector (OligoEngine). Immunochemical Methods—Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed as described (6Liu S. Bekker-Jensen S. Mailand N. Lukas C. Bartek J. Lukas J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 6056-6064Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 21Falck J. Petrini J.H. Williams B.R. Lukas J. Bartek J. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 290-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Antibodies used included phosphospecific rabbit polyclonal antibodies against Chk1-S317, Chk1-S345, Nbs1-S343, and Smc1-S966 (Cell Signaling); additional polyclonal antibodies included ATRIP, total Smc1 (Abcam), goat antibodies against ATR, γ-tubulin, and MCM6 (Santa Cruz). Rabbit polyclonal TopBP1 antibody was raised against recombinant His-tagged human TopBP1 peptide comprising amino acid residues 900–1200. In addition another rabbit polyclonal TopBP1 antibody was used (Abcam). The HCLK2 antibody used was a gift from S. Hekimi. In addition, mouse monoclonal antibodies against FLAG (clone 2, Sigma) and Chk1 (DSC 316) were applied. Kinase Assay—Lysis, immunoprecipitation, and kinase reactions were performed as described earlier (22Matsuoka S. Rotman G. Ogawa A. Shiloh Y. Tamai K. Elledge S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The ATR, TopBP1, FLAG, and HCLK2 antibodies used for immunoprecipitations was described under “Immunochemical Methods.” Immunoprecipitated proteins were mixed with kinase buffer containing 25 μm ATP, 15 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 8 μg of GST-p531–43 (residues 1–47) or GST-MCM2 (residues 1–285) and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. Labeled proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and substrate phosphorylation was visualized and quantified by phosphorimaging. In experiments where immunoprecipitated HCLK2 was added to the kinase reactions (Figs. 1D and 5A and supplemental Figs. S5, C and E, and S8, A and B), HCLK2 was immunoprecipitated from 2.5 mg of cell lysate. In Fig. 5, C and D, and supplemental Fig. S8, C and D, 3 μg of GST-TopBP1 (ATR-activating domain) was added.FIGURE 5HCLK2 is required for TopBP1-mediated activation of ATR and vice versa.

Two parallel analyses to assay the number of mitotic cells were performed as previously described (23Syljuasen R.G. Sorensen C.S. Nylandsted J. Lukas C. Lukas J. Bartek J. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 9035-9040Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Clonogenic Survival Assays—U-2-OS cells were transfected with control, HCLK2, TopBP1, or HCLK2/TopBP1 siRNAs. 2 days after transfection, between 100 and 2000 cells (depending on radiation/drug dose to yield 30–200 colonies per dish) were seeded to 6-cm-diameter dishes, incubated for 20–24 h and treated with hydroxyurea (0, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, or 1.5 mm, for 24 h), IR (0, 1, 2, or 4 Gy), or UV (0, 3 or 7 J/m2). Subsequently, cells were incubated for additional 10 days and stained with crystal violet. Colonies containing more than 50 cells were scored as survivors. Survival fractions were calculated in each experiment as the average cloning efficiency (from at least two parallel dishes) after treatment and corrected for plating efficiency. Computational Methods—Multiple sequence alignment of HCLK2 and many of its orthologs using ClustalW revealed a weak conservation between repetitive hydrophobic patterns dispersed along the central region of CLK2. By scanning the Swiss-Prot data base for human proteins with similar repetitive patterns using the Profile Pattern Search server, we found matches in HEAT-repeat regions of various HEAT repeat-containing proteins (e.g. Huntingtin, Importin β2, PP2A, FRAP, HEAT2, and HEAT5A). Hierarchical neural network (HNN) and PSIPRED predicted HCLK2 to contain 12 HEAT repeats (24McGuffin L.J. Bryson K. Jones D.T. Bioinformatics. 2000; 16: 404-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (2727) Google Scholar). HCLK2 Contributes to ATR-mediated Signaling Early after DNA Damage—To study the role of HCLK2 in ATR-mediated phosphorylations, we down-regulated HCLK2 by siRNA, exposed the cells to various types of DNA damage or replicative stress, and determined the phosphorylation status of selected ATR targets 1 h post-treatment. Consistent with the previous reports (8Kumagai A. Kim S.M. Dunphy W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49599-49608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), phosphorylation of Chk1 S317 was severely impaired after hydroxyurea and UV treatment. Surprisingly, however, phosphorylation of Nbs1 on S345 and Smc1 on S966 was also affected (Fig. 1A). We used a siRNA SmartPool for HCLK2 knockdown in this experiment but validated that each of the four HCLK2 siRNAs from the SmartPool resulted in similar defects in ATR phosphorylations (data not shown). This spectrum of phosphorylation defects is similar to what was earlier reported for either ATR or TopBP1 knockdown (6Liu S. Bekker-Jensen S. Mailand N. Lukas C. Bartek J. Lukas J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 6056-6064Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 7Garcia V. Furuya K. Carr A.M. DNA Repair (Amst). 2005; 4: 1227-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), suggesting that HCLK2, unlike Claspin but similar to TopBP1, has a more general effect on ATR-mediated phosphorylation (6Liu S. Bekker-Jensen S. Mailand N. Lukas C. Bartek J. Lukas J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 6056-6064Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). To confirm that the phosphorylation defects observed after DNA damage in HCLK2-depleted cells were a general phenomenon and not restricted to U-2-OS cells, we also performed the experiment in HeLa cells and found a similar impairment in phosphorylation of ATR targets after UV exposure (supplemental Fig. S1). HCLK2 depletion also inhibited phosphorylations of Smc1 and Nbs1 after ionizing radiation (Fig. 1A), consistent with recent studies in mice and S. cerevisiae suggesting a role of Tel2 in ATM-mediated signaling after DNA damage (17Anderson C.M. Korkin D. Smith D.L. Makovets S. Seidel J.J. Sali A. Blackburn E.H. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 854-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 18Takai H. Wang R.C. Takai K.K. Yang H. de Lange T. Cell. 2007; 131: 1248-1259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). A recent study reported that the lack of HCLK2 destabilizes the family of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-like kinases including ATR (18Takai H. Wang R.C. Takai K.K. Yang H. de Lange T. Cell. 2007; 131: 1248-1259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). We could reproduce the decrease in ATR levels in our model cell line but only after extended periods (6 days) of HCLK2 depletion (supplemental Fig. S2A). In addition, we found a similar decrease in TopBP1 levels after 6 days HCLK2 depletion, suggesting that the reduction in protein levels might be a consequence of disrupting the ATR holo-complex. This was further supported by the fact that a long term depletion of any of the members of the TopBP1/ATR-ATRIP complex resulted in decreased protein levels of the other members (supplemental Fig. S2B). Interestingly, however, we found that the defects in ATR-mediated phosphorylation in HCLK2-depleted cells occurred already before a detectable drop in ATR levels (see the time points in supplemental Fig. S2A). Therefore, to exclude the influence of decreased ATR levels, all subsequent experiments we carried out did not exceed this time point. To further exclude that reduction in ATR protein level could account for the observed reduction in phosphorylation of ATR targets in HCLK2-depleted cells at early time points, we ectopically expressed FLAG-tagged ATR from a plasmid to increase ATR levels. Indeed, also under such circumstances ATR-mediated phosphorylation was still defective (supplemental Fig. S3A). In a kinase assay we tested and verified that the overexpressed FLAG-tagged ATR was active (supplemental Fig. S3B). Because both TopPB1 and HCLK2 promote ATR-mediated phosphorylations in response to DNA damage, we wanted to compare their relative contributions to these processes. We used siRNA to deplete the two proteins either individually or in combination and assayed the phosphorylation status of Chk1, Nbs1, and Smc1 1 h after exposure of the cells to UV (Fig. 1B). We found that depleting cells for either TopBP1 or HCLK2 resulted in a severe and very similar impairment of Chk1/Nbs1/ Smc1 phosphorylations. No synergistic effect of co-depleting TopBP1 and HCLK2 was observed, suggesting that HCLK2 and TopBP1 operate in a common pathway required for ATR-mediated phosphorylation events. It has previously been shown that TopBP1 is required for ATR kinase activity (25Kumagai A. Lee J. Yoo H.Y. Dunphy W.G. Cell. 2006; 124: 943-955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). Because our data point to a similar role of HCLK2, we tested whether depletion of HCLK2 would directly affect the kinase activity of ATR in an in vitro kinase reaction. To address this, we immunoprecipitated endogenous ATR from cells treated with control siRNA or siRNA against either HCLK2 or TopBP1 for 72 h and subjected these immunoprecipitates to an in vitro kinase assay (Fig. 1C). TopBP1 depletion resulted in decreased activity of ATR (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, we observed a similar decrease in ATR kinase activity upon HCLK2 depletion (Fig. 1C). ATR kinase assays are often performed without DNA damage, as there has been observed no apparent effect of checkpoint-inducing treatments on ATR activity after extraction and immunoprecipitation from human cells (Refs. 25Kumagai A. Lee J. Yoo H.Y. Dunphy W.G. Cell. 2006; 124: 943-955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar, 26Cortez D. Guntuku S. Qin J. Elledge S.J.

Science. 1998; 281: 1677-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (1704) Google Scholar and Fig. S4, A and B). Indeed, we obtained similar results as reported above in cells exposed to replicative stress (data not shown). We next wanted to address if HCLK2-like TopBP1 could stimulate the activity of ATR. To examine this possibility, we wanted to generate recombinant GST-tagged HCLK2, but despite many attempts we failed to obtained soluble recombinant HCLK2 protein. Instead, we used HCLK2 immunoprecipitated from cells depleted of ATR and TopBP1 (supplemental Fig S5A) and treated with ATM inhibitor before being added to the kinase reaction. Under these conditions the immunoprecipitated HCLK2 contained negligible kinase activity by itself (supplemental Fig. S5B). Importantly, and consistent with a role of HCLK2 in activation of ATR, we found that incubation with HCLK2 induced an increase in both ATR autophosphorylation and kinase activity toward the p53 substrate, almost completely rescuing the decrease caused by HCLK2 depletion (Fig. 1D). Activity of protein kinases is often associated with autophosphorylation. Consistent with our observations (supplemental Fig. S3B), it has previously been reported that ATR can phosphorylate itself and that this autophosphorylation is dependent upon the integrity of the catalytic domain (26Cortez D. Guntuku S. Qin J. Elledge S.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1713-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar, 27Canman C.E. Lim D.S. Cimprich K.A. Taya Y. Tamai K. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Kastan M.B.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6707-6713Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). We observed that immunoprecipitated HCLK2 stimulated ATR kinase activity in a dose-dependent manner (supplemental Fig. S5C), and our method of measuring the stimulatory effects of HCLK2 on ATR kinase activity was further supported by experiments showing that FLAG-HCLK2 isolated by anti-FLAG antibodies and eluted with 3X-FLAG peptide also yielded a similar stimulation in ATR activity (supplemental Fig. S5D). In addition, we found that also in vitro translated green fluorescent protein-tagged HCLK2 stimulated ATR autophosphorylation and kinase activity toward the p53 substrate. (supplemental Fig. S5E). The specificity of the assay was verified by performing immunoprecipitations in cells depleted for ATR or by adding caffeine to the kinase reaction. In both cases a reduction in ATR kinase activity was observed (Fig. 1C and supplemental Fig. S5F). Similar amounts of ATR were immunoprecipitated from cells treated with control and HCLK2 siRNA (Fig. 1D), emphasizing that at early time point ATR levels did reduce in HCLK2-depleted cells in our cell model, supporting a role of HCLK2 in ATR activation per se. ATR Association of HCLK2 Resides within Residues 292–603 of HCLK2—Because depletion of either TopBP1 or HCLK2 resulted in similar defects in ATR kinase activity and codepletion of these factors did not show any apparent synergistic effects, we wanted to test if the three proteins associated in vivo. Indeed, immunoaffinity purifications identified HCLK2 in a complex containing fractions of ATR-ATRIP and TopBP1. The associations of HCLK2, TopBP1, and ATR were shown both for overexpressed FLAG-tagged and endogenous HCLK2 and verified by reciprocal immunoprecipitations using antibodies against ATR and TopBP1 (Fig. 2, A–D). Importantly, even though it is a minor fraction of the total amount of ATR that associates with HCLK2 and TopBP1, our results show that this fraction of ATR is active (Fig. 2, B and C). The associations between ATR, TopBP1, and HCLK2 were unaffected by DNA damage (supplemental Fig. S6A; data not shown). This is similar to previous studies observing no effect on the amount of ATR-ATRIP associating with TopBP1 after ionizing radiation (29Mordes D.A. Glick G.G. Zhao R. Cortez D. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 1478-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). By overexpressing various fragments of HCLK2 fused to a FLAG tag, we found that the 292–603 amino acid region of HCLK2 is required for association with ATR. Within this fragment, we were not able to narrow down the region responsible for the interaction any further (data not shown). The binding to TopBP1 resides within residues 1–603 (Fig. 2D). Like Tel2, HCLK2 mainly consist of α-helices and is structurally similar to proteins from the ARM repeat superfamily. HCLK2 is predicted to contain 12 HEAT repeats, five of which are found within the HCLK2 fragment required for the interaction with ATR (supplemental Fig. S6, B and C). HCLK2 Is Required fo"

They are valuable pharmacological tools and also have potential therapeutic applications particularly for the treatment of chronic pain. α-Conotoxin GID is isolated from the venom of Conus geographus and has an unusual N-terminal tail sequence that has been shown to be important for binding to the α4β2 subtype of the nAChR. To date, only four conotoxins that inhibit the α4β2 subtype have been characterized, but they are of considerable interest as it is the most abundant nAChR subtype in the mammalian brain and has been implicated in a range of diseases. In this study, analysis of alanine-scan and truncation mutants of GID reveals that a conserved proline in α-conotoxins is important for activity at the α7, α3β2, and α4β2 subtypes. Although the proline residue was the most critical residue for activity at the α3β2 subtype, Asp3, Arg12, and Asn14 are also critical at the α7 subtype. Interestingly, very few of the mutations tested retained activity at the α4β2 subtype indicating a tightly defined binding site. This lack of tolerance to sequence variation may explain the lack of selective ligands discovered for the α4β2 subtype to date. Overall, our findings contribute to the understanding of the structure-activity relationships of α-conotoxins and may be beneficial for the ongoing attempts to exploit modulators of the neuronal nAChRs as therapeutic agents. α-Conotoxins are small disulfide-rich peptides from the venom of the Conus species that target the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR).

Loughnan M.L. Millard E.L. Alewood P.F. Adams D.J. Daly N.L. Craik D.J. Lewis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3137-3144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Notable features of its sequence include a four-residue extended N-terminal “tail” upstream of the first cysteine, two post-translationally modified residues, γ-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) and hydroxyproline (Hyp), and the fact that it lacks an amidated C terminus typical of most α-conotoxins. The three-dimensional structure of GID includes the classic two-loop structural motif of the α-conotoxins, but the N-terminal tail is disordered in solution, as shown in Fig. 1. GID selectively inhibits the α7, α3β2, and α4β2 subtypes of the neuronal nAChR, with high potency, with IC50 values of 4.5, 3.1, and 152 nm, respectively (9Nicke A. Loughnan M.L. Millard E.L.

Deletion of the N-terminal four residues [Δ1–4]GID has been shown to significantly decrease activity at the α4β2 receptor, while causing no change in potency at α7 and α3β2 receptors (9Nicke A. Loughnan M.L. Millard E.L. Alewood P.F. Adams D.J. Daly N.L. Craik D.J. Lewis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3137-3144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). It has been reported that Arg12 is important for activity at the α4β2 and the α7 receptor but not at the α3β2 receptor.In this study, we used alanine-scan mutagenesis to identify which GID residues affect potency at α7, α3β2, and α4β2 neuronal nAChRs. The α4β2 receptor subtype is of particular importance because it is widely distributed in the brain and specific ligands have therapeutic potential (10Lam S. Patel P.N. Cardiol. Rev. 2007; 15: 154-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Additional mutants were synthesized to examine the effect of the unusual N-terminal tail and post-translational modifications present in GID. Mutants were synthesized with truncations in the N-terminal tail, and the γ-carboxyglutamic acid residue was replaced with a glutamic acid, and the hydroxyproline was replaced with a proline. In addition, the C terminus was amidated as this post-translational modification is present in the majority of α-conotoxins.To fully understand the effects of mutations, as well as determining their effects on activity, it is crucial to examine influences on structure. Conotoxins are ideally suited to analysis with NMR spectroscopy, and this technique was used for the GID analogues. Specifically, NMR H-α chemical shifts were used to identify the presence of any structural differences of the mutants from the native toxin. Because of the significant influence of truncation of the N-terminal tail on α4β2 receptor activity (9Nicke A. Loughnan M.L. Millard E.L. Alewood P.F. Adams D.J. Daly N.L. Craik D.J. Lewis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3137-3144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), the complete three-dimensional structure of the truncated peptide was determined. Furthermore, given the critical role of Arg12 in α7 and α4β2 activity, the complete solution structure of [R12A]GID was also determined. Overall, the results reveal that although only a few residues are critical for activity at the α7 and α3β2 nAChR subtypes, few of the mutations studied maintain activity at the α4β2 receptor, indicating that the interaction of GID with this nAChR subtype requires much more specific interactions.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSynthesis of GID MutantsFor peptide synthesis, GID and analogues were manually synthesized by t-butoxycarbonyl chemistry, deprotected, and cleaved from the resin as described previously (11Schnölzer M.

The HPLC-purified reduced peptides (100 μm) were oxidized in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate at pH 7.5–8.2 with stirring for 48 h at 4 °C. The oxidized peptides were purified by preparative RP-HPLC. GID was quantified in triplicate by amino acid analysis (12Bidlingmeyer B.A. Cohen S.A. Tarvin T.L. J.

Gene (Amst.). 1995; 160: 213-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Capped cRNAs were synthesized from linearized plasmid cDNAs using the Message Machine kit (Ambion, Austin, TX).Expression in Xenopus Oocytes—Oocytes were prepared as described previously (14Nicke A.

Briefly, oocytes were injected with 50 nl of cRNA (5–50 ng/μl) and kept at 18–19 °C in ND96 (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) supplemented with 50 mg/liter gentamycin and 5 mm pyruvic acid or 1 mm Ca2+ (Sigma).Two-electrode Voltage Clamp Recording—Two-electrode voltage-clamp recordings were performed on Xenopus oocytes 2–10 days after cRNA injection using holding potentials of –70 or –80 mV. Pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass (Harvard Apparatus Ltd., Kent, UK) and when filled with 3 m KCl had resistances below 1.5 megohms. Currents were recorded using either a TEC-05 amplifier (npi electronics, GmbH, Tamm, Germany) or an automated workstation with eight channels in parallel, including drug delivery and on-line analysis (OpusXpress™ 6000A workstation, Molecular Devices, Union City, CA), filtered at 100–200 Hz, and sampled at 300–500 Hz. Recordings were performed in ND96 at room temperature (22–24 °C). The half-maximally effective agonist concentration (EC50) was determined for each of the nAChR subtypes tested. EC50 values of ∼300, 30, and 10 μm ACh were obtained for α7, α3β2, and α4β2 nAChRs, respectively, which are consistent with those reported previously (16Vibat C.R. Lasalde J.A. McNamee M.G.

Furthermore, lower ACh concentrations (10–30 μm) used to activate α4β2 nAChRs gave similar results for conotoxin inhibition indicating that the agonist concentration did not influence the results. Nicotine was used for the α7 nAChRs to avoid the partial agonist effect of choline because of the potential breakdown of ACh. Toxins and agonists were applied as described (15Dutertre S. Nicke A.

Peak current amplitudes were measured before and following 180 or 200 s incubation of the GID analogues. To obtain estimates of potency, concentration-response curves were fitted to the pooled data by Equation 1,% response=100/{1+([toxin]/IC50)nH}(Eq. 1) using Sigmaplot (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL) or Prism (Graph Pad, San Diego) software, with significant differences between the control GID and the analogues determined by t test (p < 0.05).NMR Solution StructuresNMR Spectroscopy—Samples for 1H NMR measurement contained 0.7–2.5 mm synthetic peptide in 95% H2O, 5% D2O, or 100% D2O at pH 4. Spectra were obtained on a Bruker AMX 500-MHz, Bruker DMX 600-MHz, or Bruker DMX 750-MHz spectrometer at 280 and 287 K. All spectra were acquired in phase-sensitive mode using time proportional phase as described previously (9Nicke A. Loughnan M.L. Millard E.L. Alewood P.F. Adams D.J. Daly N.L. Craik D.J. Lewis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3137-3144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Briefly, the homonuclear spectra recorded included DQF-COSY and TOCSY, using a MLEV17 spin lock sequence with an isotropic mixing time of 80 ms, and ECOSY and NOESY with mixing times of 150, 250, and 350 ms. In DQF-COSY and ECOSY experiments, the water resonance was suppressed by low power irradiation during the relaxation delay. For the TOCSY and NOESY experiments, water suppression was achieved using a modified WATERGATE sequence. Two-dimensional spectra were generally collected over 4096 data points in the f2 dimension and 512 increments in the f1 dimension over a spectral width corresponding to 12 ppm. For identification of slowly exchanging amides, a series of one-dimensional and TOCSY spectra were run immediately after dissolving the sample in D2O. All spectra were processed using XWINNMR (Bruker). The f1 dimension was zero-filled to 2048 real data points with the f1 and f2 dimensions being multiplied by a sine-squared function shifted by 90° prior to Fourier transformation. Processed spectra were analyzed and assigned using the program XEASY (19Eccles C. Guntert P. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1991; 1: 111-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Spectra were assigned using the sequential assignment protocol (20Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. Wiley-Interscience, New York1986: 117-176Google Scholar).Structure Calculations—Cross-peaks in NOESY spectra recorded in 95% H2O, 5% D2O with mixing times of 250 ms were integrated and calibrated in XEASY, and distance constraints were derived using DYANA (21Guntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2545) Google Scholar). Backbone dihedral angle restraints were derived from 3JHNHα coupling constants measured from line shape analysis of antiphase cross-peak splitting in the DQF-COSY spectrum. Angles were restrained to –120 ± 30° for 3JHNHα > 8.5 Hz and to –60 ± 30° for 3JHNHα < 5 Hz. Stereospecific assignments of β-methylene protons and χ1 dihedral angles were derived from 3Jαβ coupling constants, measured from ECOSY spectra, in combination with NOE peak intensities. Slowly exchanging amide protons identified by D2O exchange experiments were used in conjunction with preliminary structures to determine hydrogen bonds. In cases where hydrogen bonds could be unambiguously assigned, appropriate distance restraints were included in the structure calculations. Preliminary structures were calculated using a torsion angle simulated annealing protocol within DYANA and final structures calculated using simulated annealing and energy minimization protocols within CNS version 1.0 as described previously (9Nicke A. Loughnan M.L. Millard E.L. Alewood P.F. Adams D.J. Daly N.L. Craik D.J. Lewis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3137-3144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The starting structures were generated using random ϕ, ψ dihedral angles and energy-minimized to produce structures with the correct local geometry. A set of 50 structures was generated by a torsion angle simulated annealing protocol (22Rice L.M. Brünger A.T. Proteins. 1994; 19: 277-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). This protocol involves a high temperature phase comprising 4000 steps of 0.015 ps of torsion angle dynamics, a cooling phase with 4000 steps of 0.015 ps of torsion angle dynamics during which the temperature is lowered to 0 K, and finally an energy minimization phase comprising 5000 steps of Powell minimization. Structures consistent with restraints were subjected to further molecular dynamics and energy minimization in a water shell, as described by Linge and Nilges (23Linge J.P. Nilges M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The refinement in explicit water involves the following steps. First heating to 500 K via steps of 100 K, each comprising 50 steps of 0.005 ps of Cartesian dynamics. Second, 2500 steps of 0.005 ps of Cartesian dynamics at 500 K before a cooling phase where the temperature is lowered in steps of 100 K, each comprising 2500 steps of 0.005 ps of Cartesian dynamics. Finally, the structures were minimized with 2000 steps of Powell minimization. Structures were analyzed using Promotif and Procheck (24Hutchinson E.G. Thornton J.M.

A list of the sequences of the analogues is given in Table 1. All mutants folded predominantly into a single isomer in ammonium bicarbonate buffer as determined by RP-HPLC. To compare the effects of the synthetically mutated peptides on activity, we determined their IC50 values by two-electrode voltage clamp analysis on α7, α3β2, and α4β2 receptors expressed in oocytes.TABLE 1Sequences of GID and analoguesPeptideSequenceGIDIRDγCCSNPACRVNNOHVC[γ4E]GID (GID*)IRDECCSNPACRVNNOHVC[I1A]GID*ARDECCSNPACRVNNOHVC[R2A]GID*IADECCSNPACRVNNOHVC[D3A]GID*IRAECCSNPACRVNNOHVC[γ4A]GIDIRDACCSNPACRVNNOHVC[S7A]GID*IRDECCANPACRVNNOHVC[N8A]GID*IRDECCSAPACRVNNOHVC[P9A]GID*IRDECCSNAACRVNNOHVC[R12A]GIDa[R12A]GID was synthesized with a γ-carboxyglutamic acid at position 4, in contrast to the other mutants, because it was obtained from the study by Nicke et al.

Open table in a new tab Functional Assays—α-Conotoxin GID antagonized the α7, α3β2, and α4β2 nAChRs with IC50 values of 5.1, 3.4, and 128.6 nm, respectively, which is consistent with the data reported previously (9Nicke A. Loughnan M.L. Millard E.L. Alewood P.F. Adams D.J. Daly N.L. Craik D.J. Lewis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3137-3144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The activity at the three different nAChRs was not significantly changed with the substitution of a glutamic acid residue in the position of the γ-carboxyglutamic acid. This analogue ([γ4E]GID), resulted in IC50 values of 5.9, 2.9, and 56.8 nm for the α7, α3β2, and α4β2 subtypes, respectively, as shown in Fig. 2. Thus, all other (alanine-substituted) analogues were synthesized with glutamic acid at position 4 with the exception of R12A, which was obtained from a previous study where γ-carboxyglutamic was used (9Nicke A. Loughnan M.L. Millard E.L. Alewood P.F. Adams D.J. Daly N.L. Craik D.J. Lewis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3137-3144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). [γ4E]GID is referred to hereafter as GID* to simplify the naming scheme of the analogues.FIGURE 2Selectivity of α-conotoxin GID and its analogues for rat nAChR subunit combinations expressed in Xenopus oocytes.

Panel i, superimposed traces of ACh-evoked currents in the absence (control) and presence of GID* following a 200-s incubation. Oocytes were voltage clamped at –80 mV, and membrane currents were evoked with 100μm ACh. 10 nm GID* inhibitedα7 andα3β2 nAChR peak amplitude currents by 65.3 ± 5.5% (n = 3) and 75.6 ± 6.0% (n = 3), respectively, whereas 1 μm GID* inhibited the α4β2 nAChR current by 86.0 ± 3.6% (n = 3). Complete recovery was observed following washout after 10 min (broken line). Panel ii, concentration-response curves obtained for the inhibition of ACh-evoked current amplitude after a 200-s incubation with GID (○) and its analogues, GID* (▿), [P9A]GID* (□), [R2A]GID* (⋄), and [γ4A,Δ1–3]GID (▵) (see Table 2 for IC50 values).

Loughnan M.L. Millard E.L. Alewood P.F. Adams D.J. Daly N.L. Craik D.J. Lewis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3137-3144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), and thus it was of interest to examine the effects of alanine mutations of the tail as well as N-terminally truncated variants. For the series of alanine mutants, the most significant differences in activity were observed at the α4β2 subtype, as shown in Table 2. Replacement of Ile1 and Gla4 with Ala had relatively small but significant effects on the IC50 values at the α4β2 subtype. By contrast, replacement of residues 2 and 3 with Ala led to no detectable activity at concentrations up to 1 μm. At the α7 subtype [D3A]GID* had decreased activity. Truncating the N terminus sequentially by 1–4 residues also resulted in inactive analogues at the α4β2 subtype, whereas in general only minor variations in the IC50 values were observed at the α7 and α3β2 subtypes (Table 2). Interestingly, [γ4A]GID exhibited increased potency at α4β2 subtype, whereas the decreased potency of [γ4A,Δ1–3]GID highlighted the importance of the first three residues for activity at α7, α3β2, and α4β2.TABLE 2Electrophysiology results for GID and its analoguesMutantsα7α3β2α4β2IC50Hill slopenIC50Hill slopenIC50Hill slopenGID5.1 ± 1.31.333.4 ± 0.51.33128.6 ± 13.11.24[γ4E]GID5.9 ± 0.61.332.9 ± 0.61.1356.8 ± 13.21.03[γ4E,I1A]GID5.9 ± 1.60.8415.5 ± 2.21.26255.9 ± 57.21.39[γ4E,R2A]GID12.5 ± 4.41.0497.6 ± 28.40.95NA4[γ4E,D3A]GID42.1 ± 10.91.7369.8 ± 16.51.25NA4[γ4A]GID6.1 ± 2.81.233.0 ± 0.61.7352.0 ± 16.51.03[γ4E,S7A]GID12.8 ± 1.51.432.5 ± 0.32.24429.9 ± 82.61.23[γ4E,N8A]GID>30aWhere IC50 values were unable to be determined, estimations are represented as > the highest concentration tested.

Open table in a new tab Alanine Scan of the Inter-cysteine Loops—An alanine scan of residues in the two inter-cysteine loops revealed that the proline residue conserved in the majority of α-conotoxins had the most significant influence on activity (Table 2). At the α7 nAChR subtype, the P9A analogue displayed an 18-fold decrease in potency relative to GID. The other mutations that led to significant reductions in activity were [S7A]GID*, [R12A]GID, and [N14A]GID*. The result obtained here for [R12A]GID is consistent with that reported previously (9Nicke A. Loughnan M.L. Millard E.L. Alewood P.F. Adams D.J. Daly N.L. Craik D.J. Lewis R.J. J. Biol.

At the α3β2 nAChR (Fig. 3A), many analogues exhibited significant reductions in activity, [P9A]GID* decreased ∼50-fold and [V18A]GID* decreased >10-fold in antagonist potency. The majority of the other mutants in the inter-cysteine loops had smaller albeit significant decreases in potency, with a change in the IC50 of less than 10-fold compared with GID. Only [V13A]GID* showed a significant increase in potency (>5-fold) at α3β2.FIGURE 3Comparison of the chemical shifts of GID with the mutants. The H-α chemical shifts of GID (9Nicke A. Loughnan M.L.

The only mutant without a significant influence on activity was [V13A]GID*. The mutations that led to a loss in activity included the amidation of the C terminus, a common post-translational modification observed in α-conotoxins. The significant reduction in potency demonstrated by several residues throughout the N-terminal tail and the two inter-cysteine loops suggest that the interaction of the toxin with the α4β2 receptor is highly specific.NMR Secondary Shift Analysis of GID Mutants—All of the alanine mutants were analyzed by NMR, and the H-α chemical shifts were determined and compared with GID. The differences between the H-α chemical shifts and random coil values are shown in Fig. 3. In general, the mutants overlay closely with GID, and therefore no major changes in secondary structure were observed with the alanine substitutions. This result suggests that all the mutants have a well defined helix, as is observed for almost all α-conotoxins (26Millard E.L. Daly N.L. Craik D.J. Eur. J.

https://openalex.org/W2054320133,"Cysteine string protein (Csp) is a J-domain-containing protein whose overexpression blocks the exit of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Another method of blocking ER exit, the overexpression of Sar1-GTP, however, yielded twice as much immature CFTR compared with Csp overexpression. This finding suggested that Csp not only inhibits CFTR ER exit but also facilitates the degradation of immature CFTR. This was confirmed by treatment with a proteasome inhibitor, which returned the level of immature CFTR to that found in cells expressing Sar1-GTP only. CspH43Q, which does not interact with Hsc70/Hsp70 efficiently, did not promote CFTR degradation, suggesting that the pro-degradative effect of Csp requires Hsc70/Hsp70 binding/activation. In agreement with this, Csp overexpression increased the amount of Hsc70/Hsp70 co-immunoprecipitated with CFTR, whereas overexpression of CspH43Q did not. The Hsc70/Hsp70 binding partner C terminus of Hsp70-interacting protein (CHIP) can target CFTR for proteasome-mediated degradation. Csp overexpression also increased the amount of CHIP co-immunoprecipitated with CFTR. In addition, CHIP interacted directly with Csp, which was confirmed by in vitro binding experiments. Csp overexpression also increased CFTR ubiquitylation and reduced the half-life of immature CFTR. These findings indicate that Csp not only regulates the exit of CFTR from the ER, but that this action is accompanied by Hsc70/Hsp70 and CHIP-mediated CFTR degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2088983608,"Background The biogenesis of spliceosomal snRNPs takes place in both the cytoplasm where Sm core proteins are added and snRNAs are modified at the 5′ and 3′ termini and in the nucleus where snRNP-specific proteins associate. U1 snRNP consists of U1 snRNA, seven Sm proteins and three snRNP-specific proteins, U1-70K, U1A, and U1C. It has been shown previously that after import to the nucleus U2 and U4/U6 snRNP-specific proteins first appear in Cajal bodies (CB) and then in splicing speckles. In addition, in cells grown under normal conditions U2, U4, U5, and U6 snRNAs/snRNPs are abundant in CBs. Therefore, it has been proposed that the final assembly of these spliceosomal snRNPs takes place in this nuclear compartment. In contrast, U1 snRNA in both animal and plant cells has rarely been found in this nuclear compartment. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we analysed the subnuclear distribution of Arabidopsis U1 snRNP-specific proteins fused to GFP or mRFP in transiently transformed Arabidopsis protoplasts. Irrespective of the tag used, U1-70K was exclusively found in the nucleus, whereas U1A and U1C were equally distributed between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. In the nucleus all three proteins localised to CBs and nucleoli although to different extent. Interestingly, we also found that the appearance of the three proteins in nuclear speckles differ significantly. U1-70K was mostly found in speckles whereas U1A and U1C in ∼90% of cells showed diffuse nucleoplasmic in combination with CBs and nucleolar localisation. Conclusions/Significance Our data indicate that CBs and nucleolus are involved in the maturation of U1 snRNP. Differences in nuclear accumulation and distribution between U1-70K and U1A and U1C proteins may indicate that either U1-70K or U1A and U1C associate with, or is/are involved, in other nuclear processes apart from pre-mRNA splicing."
https://openalex.org/W2009043313,"Bacterial nitrile hydratase (NHases) are important industrial catalysts and waste water remediation tools. In a global computational screening of conventional and metagenomic sequence data for NHases, we detected the two usually separated NHase subunits fused in one protein of the choanoflagellate Monosiga brevicollis, a recently sequenced unicellular model organism from the closest sister group of Metazoa. This is the first time that an NHase is found in eukaryotes and the first time it is observed as a fusion protein. The presence of an intron, subunit fusion and expressed sequence tags covering parts of the gene exclude contamination and suggest a functional gene. Phylogenetic analyses and genomic context imply a probable ancient horizontal gene transfer (HGT) from proteobacteria. The newly discovered NHase might open biotechnological routes due to its unconventional structure, its new type of host and its apparent integration into eukaryotic protein networks."
https://openalex.org/W2031354156,"In this study, we describe a novel CD4-targeting bifunctional human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) fusion inhibitor (CD4-BFFI) that blocks HIV-1 entry by inhibiting both HIV-1 attachment and fusion and is highly potent against both R5 and X4 HIV-1 viruses in various antiviral assays, including peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) infection assays. Previously, we have reported a CCR5 antibody-based bifunctional HIV-1 fusion inhibitor (BFFI) that was highly active in blocking R5 HIV-1 infection but was ineffective against X4 viruses infecting human PBMCs (Kopetzki, E., Jekle, A., Ji, C., Rao, E., Zhang, J., Fischer, S., Cammack, N., Sankuratri, S., and Heilek, G.

CD4-BFFI, which consists of two HIV-1 fusion inhibitor (FI) T-651 variant peptides recombinantly fused to the Fc end of a humanized anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody, has demonstrated more than 100-fold greater antiviral activity than T-651 variant or the parental CD4 monoclonal antibody. Mechanistic studies revealed that CD4-BFFI primarily blocks the HIV-1-cell fusion step through its FI peptide moieties. The enhanced antiviral activity of CD4-BFFI is most likely due to avid binding of the bivalent FI peptides as well as the increased local concentration of CD4-BFFI via attachment to the target cell surface receptor CD4. In vivo pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that CD4-BFFI was stable in monkey blood, and a dose of 10 mg/kg maintained serum concentrations greater than 2,000-fold over the IC90 value for 7 days postdosing.

HIV-1 recognizes its host cells by binding to the cell surface receptor CD4 and coreceptors via its envelope protein gp120. gp120 is a globular glycoprotein which is noncovalently associated with the transmembrane protein gp41. Upon binding to CD4, gp120 undergoes conformational changes allowing it to interact with one of two major coreceptors: CCR5 or CXCR4. Although the majority of primary HIV-1 strains during early phases of infection use CCR5 as coreceptor (termed R5 virus), some viruses use CXCR4 (termed X4 virus) or both CCR5 and CXCR4 (termed R5X4 virus or dual-tropic viruses) (1Coakley E. Petropoulos C.J. Whitcomb J.M. Curr. Opin. Infect. Dis. 2005; 18: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Both gp120 and gp41 exist as trimers on the HIV-1 particle surface. HIV-1 gp41 contains three domains: an extracellular, a transmembrane, and a cytoplasmic domain. The extracellular domain contains an amino-terminal hydrophobic fusion peptide and two heptad repeats (HR). Binding of gp120 to the coreceptor triggers structural rearrangement in gp41, leading to virus-host cell fusion. The fusion process begins with the insertion of the gp41 fusion peptide into the host cell membrane, forming a bridge between virus and cell. The COOH-terminal HR (HR2) domains then associate with the NH2-terminal HR (HR1) domains in an anti-parallel manner. This HR1-HR2 interaction results in the formation of a six-helix bundle (three HR2 helices packed on the outer surface of the trimeric HR1 helices) (2Weissenhorn W. Dessen A. Harrison S.C. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 426-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1459) Google Scholar, 3Chan D.C. Fass D. Berger J.M. Kim P.S. Cell. 1997; 89: 263-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1832) Google Scholar). This six-helix bundle formation brings the viral and cell membranes to close proximity, thus resulting in virus-cell fusion and the entry of the viral core into the host cell cytoplasm. The highly active anti-retroviral therapy regime, a combination therapy comprising three or more anti-HIV-1 agents, targeting one or more HIV-1 or host proteins, is the current standard of care for HIV-1/AIDS patients. The majority of the HIV-1 drugs on the market target HIV-1 enzymes, such as the reverse transcriptase, protease, and integrase. The emergence of drug resistance to the currently available treatment options necessitates the development of new classes of anti-HIV-1 drugs (4Shafer R.W. Schapiro J.M. AIDS Rev. 2008; 10: 67-84PubMed Google Scholar). One of the steps in the viral life cycle for therapeutic intervention is the viral entry process (5Borkow G. Lapidot A. Curr. Drug Targets Infect. Disord. 2005; 5: 3-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 6Lazzarin A. Expert. Opin. Pharmacother. 2005; 6: 453-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 7Liu S. Wu S. Jiang S. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2007; 13: 143-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Drugs that target the HIV-1 entry steps have shown potent antiviral effects in preclinical and clinical studies. The first HIV-1 entry inhibitor on the market, enfuvirtide (ENF, T-20), is a HR2-derived peptide inhibitor that targets the six-helix bundle formation (6Lazzarin A. Expert. Opin. Pharmacother. 2005; 6: 453-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Maraviroc, a second HIV-1 entry inhibitor approved in 2007, is a CCR5 antagonist. However, maraviroc only blocks R5 HIV-1 entry and not X4 or dual-tropic viruses (8Carter N.J. Keating G.M. Drugs. 2007; 67: 2277-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Despite its clinically proven efficacy, the use of ENF is limited by its twice daily dosing regimen (due to rapid elimination of the peptide from plasma), as well as the low genetic barrier to resistance and injection site reactions in some patients. Recently, we reported a novel strategy to enhance the in vivo exposure of HIV-1 fusion inhibitor (FI) while maintaining its antiviral potency against R5 viruses (9Kopetzki E. Jekle A. Ji C. Rao E. Zhang J. Fischer S. Cammack N. Sankuratri S. Heilek G. Virology J. 2008; 5: 56-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This strategy used a CCR5 monoclonal antibody (mAb) as the scaffold for the fusion inhibitor peptide. This mAb-FI chimeric protein contains two HIV-1 entry inhibitors: a CCR5 mAb that blocks HIV-1 attachment to the CCR5 coreceptor and a FI that blocks the HIV-1-host cell fusion; thus, it was named bifunctional HIV-1 fusion inhibitor (BFFI). BFFI showed greater antiviral potency than either the FI peptide or the CCR5 mAb in in vitro antiviral assays. However, it failed to block the entry of X4 and R5X4 viruses into subsets of HIV-1 target cells expressing CXCR4 but not CCR5, suggesting that anchoring of this bifunctional molecule to the target cell through CCR5 is essential for X4 inhibitory activity (9Kopetzki E. Jekle A. Ji C. Rao E. Zhang J. Fischer S. Cammack N. Sankuratri S. Heilek G. Virology J. 2008; 5: 56-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Here, we describe a second generation BFFI molecule that is equally potent in inhibiting R5 and X4 HIV-1 entry. This new BFFI utilizes a CD4 mAb instead of a CCR5 mAb for anchoring to the target cell surface and thus was named CD4-BFFI, to differentiate it from the previously reported CCR5 mAb-based BFFI (CCR5-BFFI). The CD4 mAb used in the CD4-BFFI molecule was derived from the well studied humanized anti-human CD4 mAb TNX-355 (also called Hu5A8) (10Boon L. Holland B. Gordon W. Liu P. Shiau F. Shanahan W. Reimann K.A. Fung M. Toxicology. 2002; 172: 191-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 11Kuritzkes D.R. Jacobson J. Powderly W.G. Godofsky E. DeJesus E. Haas F. Reimann K.A. Larson J.L. Yarbough P.O. Curt V. Shanahan Jr., W.R. J. Infect. Dis. 2004; 189: 286-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). TNX-355 had completed clinical phase 2 trials and demonstrated good efficacy and safety in HIV-1 patients (10Boon L. Holland B. Gordon W. Liu P. Shiau F. Shanahan W. Reimann K.A. Fung M. Toxicology. 2002; 172: 191-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 11Kuritzkes D.R. Jacobson J. Powderly W.G. Godofsky E. DeJesus E. Haas F. Reimann K.A. Larson J.L. Yarbough P.O. Curt V.

In in vitro antiviral assays, CD4-BFFI demonstrated higher potency than the fusion inhibitor T-651 variant (T651v) or the parental CD4 mAb alone. Moreover, CD4-BFFI is highly stable in vitro and in vivo. Reagents, Viruses, and Cell Lines—JC53BL (TZM-bl) cells were obtained from the National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Reference Reagent program. 293T human embryonic kidney cells and HEK293-EBNA cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA). MAGI-CCR5 cells were generated in house (9Kopetzki E. Jekle A. Ji C. Rao E. Zhang J. Fischer S. Cammack N. Sankuratri S. Heilek G. Virology J. 2008; 5: 56-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Human PBMCs were obtained from AllCells (Emeryville, CA), stimulated for 1 day in PBMC medium (RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 2 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.1 mm minimum Eagle's medium nonessential amino acids) supplemented with 2 μg/ml phytohemagglutinin (all from Invitrogen) and maintained in PBMC medium containing 5 units/ml human interleukin-2 (Roche Applied Science). NL4-3 was obtained from the National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Reference Reagent program. The NH2-terminally acetylated and COOH-terminally amidated fusion inhibitor peptides T-651v and T-651v mutant (T-651mut) were chemically synthesized in-house as described before (14Dwyer J.J. Wilson K.L. Davison D.K. Freel S.A. Seedorff J.E. Wring S.A. Tvermoes N.A. Matthews T.J. Greenberg M.L. Delmedico M.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 12772-12777Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Expression Plasmids—For the construction of the bifunctional human CD4 antibody-based fusion inhibitors, the variable domains (VL and VH) of the humanized human CD4-specific mAb (hu5A8, also called TNX-355) (15Reimann K.A. Lin W. Bixler S. Browning B. Ehrenfels B.N. Lucci J. Miatkowski K. Olson D. Parish T.H. Rosa M.D. Oleson F.B. Hsu Y.M. Padlan E.A. Letvin N.L. Burkly L.C. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1997; 13: 933-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) were cloned and expressed as the human IgG1 isotype, which carries L234A and L235A double mutations (IgG1-LALA). This reconstructed anti-CD4 mAb was named 6314. Antibody light and heavy chain genes are expressed from two identical assembled expression units, including the genomic exon-intron structure of antibody genes. The antibody light and heavy chain expression cassettes are located on the same plasmid in a clockwise orientation. Expression of cognate antibody light and heavy chain is controlled by a shortened intron A-deleted immediate early enhancer and promoter from the human cytomegalovirus and the strong polyadenylation signal from bovine growth hormone. All expression plasmids also contain an origin of replication and a β-lactamase gene from the vector pUC18 for plasmid amplification in Escherichia coli and a neomycin resistance gene for the generation/selection of stably transfected CHO cell lines (Fig. 1A). The structural gene of the light chain was assembled by fusing a chemically synthesized hu5A8 variable light chain cDNA at the 5′-end with a DNA segment encoding a murine immunoglobulin heavy chain signal sequence (containing an intron) and at the 3′-end with a DNA segment containing a splice donor site and a unique BamHI restriction site. The BamHI restriction site was used to fuse hu5A8 variable light chain to the human κ-light chain gene constant region, including a truncated human κ-light chain intron 2. The structural gene of the heavy chain was assembled by fusing a chemically synthesized hu5A8 variable heavy chain cDNA at the 5′-end with a DNA segment encoding a murine immunoglobulin heavy chain signal sequence (containing an intron) and at the 3′-end with a DNA segment containing a splice donor site and a unique XhoI restriction site. The XhoI restriction site was used to join the hu5A8 variable heavy chain with the genomic human γ1-heavy gene constant region (containing a truncated human γ1-heavy chain intron 2). For the construction of various CD4-BFFI molecules, the DNA sequences encoding the entire GS peptide linker (GGGGSGGGGSGGGGSG) and the various FI peptides were chemically synthesized and inserted into the expression plasmids through unique restriction sites. A unique HindIII restriction site was used to join the linker-FI at its 5′-end to the COOH terminus of the heavy chain of CD4 mAb 6314, and a unique NheI restriction site was used to join linker-FI at its 3′-end to the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation signal gene (Fig. 1A). The HIV-1 FI T-651v was derived from the gp41 ectodomain of HV1B8 HIV-1 reference strain (BH8 isolate; positions 610–656; residue numbering is based on the envelope polyprotein gp160 precursor) (16Ratner L. Haseltine W. Patarca R. Livak K.J. Starcich B. Josephs S.F. Doran E.R. Rafalski J.A. Whitehorn E.A. Baumeister K. Ivanoff L. Petteway S.R. Pearson M.L. Lautenberger J.A. Papas T.S. Ghrayeb J. Chang N.T. Gallo R.C. Wong-Staal F. Nature. 1985; 313: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1727) Google Scholar). This HIV-1 gp41-derived peptide contains two potential N-linked glycosylation sites, one at the NH2 terminus (NMT) and the other within the peptide. To avoid N-glycosylation that may reduce the antiviral activity of T-651v, the potential N-glycosylation site (NYT) within the peptide is inactivated through a point mutation to change Asn to Glu in all BFFI molecules except in BFFI-G2. In CD4-BFFI-G0, the NH2-terminal N-glycosylation site is also eliminated by deletion. The CD4-BFFImut molecule contains the T-651v peptide that carries four additional amino acid mutations to eliminate its antiviral activity (Fig. 1B). Expression and Purification of Antibodies—All antibodies were expressed by transient transfection of human embryonic kidney 293F cells using the FreeStyle™ 293 expression system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Antibody-containing culture supernatants were filtered and purified by two chromatographic steps. Antibodies were captured by affinity chromatography using Protein A-Sepharose™ CL-4B (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. Unbound proteins were washed out with equilibration buffer, and the antibodies were eluted with 0.1 m citrate buffer, pH 3.5, and then immediately neutralized to pH 6.0 with 1 m Tris-base. Size exclusion chromatography on Superdex 200™ (GE Healthcare) was used as a second purification step. Size exclusion chromatography was performed in 20 mm histidine buffer, 0.14 m NaCl, pH 6.0. The eluted antibodies were concentrated with an Ultrafree®-CL centrifugal filter unit equipped with a Biomax-SK membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA) and stored at -80 °C. Analytic Characterization of Antibodies—Analytical characterization of antibody proteins was performed as described before (9Kopetzki E. Jekle A. Ji C. Rao E. Zhang J. Fischer S. Cammack N. Sankuratri S. Heilek G. Virology J. 2008; 5: 56-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). N-Linked glycosylation of fusion inhibitor peptides was evaluated by SDS-PAGE and by comparison of wild type and PNGase F-treated BFFI samples. N-Linked carbohydrates were released by enzymatic treatment with 50 milliunits of PNGase F (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) per mg of protein at 37 °C for 12–24 h at a protein concentration of about 2 mg/ml. HR1 Western Blot—The BFFI molecules were detected by the interaction of the fused FI peptide sequences (derived from the HR2 of HIV-1 gp41) with its natural viral interaction partner, the HR1 of HIV-1 gp41. BFFI molecules were resolved by SDS-PAGE and blotted to membrane, and the FI-containing heavy chains were visualized by probing with biotinylated T-2324 HR1 peptide: Biotin-QARQLLSGIVQQQNNLLRAIEAQQHLLQLTVWGIKQLQARILAVERYLKDQ-NH2 (COOH-terminally amidated). The blocked membranes were incubated with 0.5 μg/ml HR1 peptide T-2324 in 0.5% (w/v) Western Blocking Reagent (Roche Applied Science) at 4 °C with shaking overnight or at least 2 h at room temperature and then stained with a streptavidin-AP (alkaline phosphatase) conjugate (Roche Applied Science). Human IgG1 ELISA and HR1 ELISA Assay—The 96-well plates were coated with monoclonal mouse anti-human IgG antibody R10Z8E9 (IgG1 ELISA) or biotinylated T-2324 HR1 peptide (HR1 ELISA) at 0.5 μg/ml in PBS containing 0.5% bovine albumin for 1 h at room temperature. The plates were washed three times with washing buffer (PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20). A standard calibration curve was generated by using serial dilutions of CD4-BFFI in PBS containing 5% cynomolgus serum and 0.5% bovine albumin. All serum samples were diluted at 1:20 to 1:20,000 to yield a concentration within the range of quantification: 0.156–10 ng/ml. One hundred μl of diluted standards or samples were added to the plates and incubated for 1 h with gentle shaking. After three washes, 100 μl of 0.2 μg/ml digoxigenin-conjugated mouse monoclonal anti-human IgG antibody R10Z8E9 was added to each well, and the plates were incubated for 1 h with shaking. The plates were washed three times, and 100 μl of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin Fab fragments was added to each well at 50 units/ml final concentration. After a 1-h incubation, the plates were washed three times, and 100 μl of ABTS substrate was added to each well. Color development was monitored every minute at 405 nm. Cell-Cell Fusion (CCF) Assay—The CCR5-dependent and CXCR4-dependent CCF assays were performed as described before (17Ji C. Zhang J. Cammack N. Sankuratri S. J. Biomol. Screen. 2006; 11: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Briefly, Hela-R5 (CCR5-dependent CCF) and Hela-X4 (CXCR4-dependent CCF) cells were plated in 384-well white culture plates at 7,500 cells/well in phenol red-free DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1× penicillin/streptomycin, 300 μg/ml G418, 100 μg/ml hygromycin, and 1 μg/ml doxycycline and incubated at 37 °C overnight to induce the expression of gp160. The target cells CEM-R5 and 5.25 in the phenol red-free growth medium were then added to the plates containing HeLa-R5 and HeLa-X4 cells, respectively, both at 1.5 × 104 cells/well. After a 20-h incubation, 15 μl of Steady-Glo luciferase substrate was added, and the luciferase activity was measured. Single-cycle Entry Assay and PBMC Antiviral Assay—These assays were performed as described before (9Kopetzki E. Jekle A. Ji C. Rao E. Zhang J. Fischer S. Cammack N. Sankuratri S. Heilek G. Virology J. 2008; 5: 56-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). For the single-cycle assay, pseudotyped viral particles were generated by co-transfecting 293T cells with pNL4-3Δenv (pNL4-3 with a deletion of the envelope gene) and the expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) encoding the envelope gene of NLBal or NL4-3. Cell culture supernatants containing pseudotyped viral particles were harvested and filtered. The equivalent of 1 × 105 relative light units of virus particles was used to infect 25,000 JC53BL cells/well in a total volume of 200 μl. After incubation for 3 days, 50 μl of Steady-Glo luciferase reagent (Promega, Madison, WI) was added and incubated for 5 min, and the plates were read using a Luminoskan (Thermo Electron Corp., Waltham, MA). For the PBMC antiviral assay, pooled human PBMCs from three or more healthy donors were stimulated for 24 h in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2 μg/ml phytohemagglutinin and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5 units/ml interleukin-2 for at least 48 h prior to the assay. In a 96-well round bottom plate, 1 × 105 PBMCs were infected with 800 pg of p24 of the indicated HIV-1 strain in the presence of serially diluted inhibitor. Plates were incubated for 6 days, and virus production was measured by using p24ELISA (PerkinElmer) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The IC50 was determined using the sigmoidal dose-response model with one binding site in Microsoft XLfit. CD4-BFFI Affinity to Cell Surface CD4 Determined by FACS—CD4 mAb 6314 and various CD4-BFFI molecules were covalently labeled with Alexa 488 by using the Alexa Fluor 488 Microscale Protein Labeling kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In all FACS assays, an isotype control antibody was used to determine the background, which was subtracted from the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) values for the test antibodies. MAGI cells (1 × 105 cells) were incubated with serially diluted antibodies for 45 min. After washing, the cells were subjected to FACS analysis. MFI values were graphed against antibody concentrations using the one-phase exponential associate curves in GraphPad Prism software (Intuitive Software for Science, San Diego, CA), and the KD values were calculated. Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) Assay—Binding affinities of CD4-BFFI molecules and T-651v peptide to the HIV-1 gp41 HR1 peptide were measured using a BIAcore3000 instrument (GE Healthcare). The Sensor Chip SA (streptavidin) was prewashed by three consecutive 1-min injections of 1 m NaCl in 50 mm NaOH. Next, the biotinylated T-2324 HR1 peptide (Biotin-QARQLLSGIVQQQNNLLRAIEAQQHLLQLTVWGIKQLQARILAVERYLKDQ-NH2) was immobilized on the SA-coated sensor chip. To avoid mass transfer limitations, the lowest possible value was loaded onto the SA-chip. The HR1 peptide (∼200 resonance units) was dissolved in HBS-P buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.005% (v/v) Surfactant P20). Before the measurements were started, the chip was regenerated with a 1-min pulse of 0.5% (w/v) SDS at a flow rate of 50 μl/min. CD4-BFFI molecules to be analyzed were diluted in HPS-P buffer to various concentrations ranging from 0.625 to 10 nm. The sample contact time was 1 min (association phase). Thereafter, the chip surface was washed with HBS-P for 10 min (dissociation phase). All interactions were performed at exactly 25 °C (standard temperature). During a measurement cycle, the samples were stored at 12 °C. Signals were detected at a detection rate of one signal/s. Samples were injected at increasing concentrations at a flow rate of 50 μl/min over the HR1 coupled biosensor element. The surface was regenerated by 1 min of washing with 0.5% (w/v) SDS solution at a flow rate of 50 μl/min. The equilibrium constants (KD), defined as ka/kd were determined by analyzing the sensorgram curves obtained with several different concentrations, using the BIAevaluation 4.1 software package. Nonspecific binding was corrected by subtracting the response value of the respective CD4-BFFI molecule with the free streptavidin surface from the value of the CD4-BFFI-HR1 interaction. The fitting of the data followed the 1:1 Langmuir binding model. Determination of Receptor Surface Expression by FACS—Expression levels of CD4, CCR5, and CXCR4 on the surface of MAGI-CCR5, JC53BL, and human PBMCs were determined by FACS (9Kopetzki E. Jekle A. Ji C. Rao E. Zhang J. Fischer S. Cammack N. Sankuratri S. Heilek G. Virology J. 2008; 5: 56-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Monkey Pharmacokinetics Study—Three male cynomolgus monkeys weighing 3–5 kg were dosed intravenously with 10 mg of CD4-BFFI/kg of body weight. Blood samples were taken immediately before dosing and 15 min, 30 min, 1 h, 3 h, 8 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, 96 h, and 168 h after dosing. Sera were prepared and stored at -80 °C before use. PBMC CD4 Occupancy—Whole blood from three monkeys before and after dosing with CD4-BFFI was incubated with mouse anti-human CD4 mAb OKT4-Pacific Blue (BioLegend, San Diego, CA) on ice for 45 min. Red blood cells were removed by incubation in 1 ml of 1× lysis buffer (PharmLyse lysis buffer (10×); BD Biosciences) for 15–20 min followed by centrifugation for 5 min at 300 × g. The pellet was washed with 250 μl of FACS staining buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 0.09% (w/v) sodium azide), and CD4 staining on monkey PBMCs was analyzed by FACS. For the calculation of CD4 occupancy, the MFI values from the predose samples were set as 0% CD4 occupancy, and the MFI from the predose samples treated with saturating amount of CD4-BFFI before adding OKT4-Pacific Blue were set as 100% occupancy. Construction and Characterization of CD4-BFFI—Previous studies with the first generation BFFI containing the HIV-1 FI peptide T-2635 fused to the COOH-terminal end of the heavy chain of a CCR5 mAb demonstrated that the fusion peptide maintains full antiviral activity when conjugated to an antibody (9Kopetzki E. Jekle A. Ji C. Rao E. Zhang J. Fischer S. Cammack N. Sankuratri S. Heilek G. Virology J. 2008; 5: 56-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The inhibition of viral entry was primarily a result of blocking the virus-cell membrane fusion step. It was demonstrated that anchoring of the T-2635 peptide to the CCR5 co-receptor is essential for maximal antiviral activity, and it was hypothesized that the increased local concentration of the T-2635 peptide at the site of viral entry achieved by antibody-mediated targeting to the CCR5 co-receptor is responsible for the increased antiviral activity. In addition, the CCR5 mAb moiety of BFFI also exerted a direct antiviral effect against R5 viruses. This bifunctional molecule was effective at inhibiting R5 viruses but not R5X4 and X4 viruses in PBMC cultures. The lack of potency against X4 and R5X4 viruses can be explained by the absence of CCR5 receptors on subsets of T lymphocytes (18Lee B. Sharron M. Montaner L.J. Weissman D. Doms R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5215-5220Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Therefore, we speculated that a CD4 mAb-based bifunctional inhibitor targeting all cell types susceptible to HIV-1 infection would prevent entry of HIV-1 irrespective of viral tropism. To test this hypothesis, a bifunctional CD4 mAb-FI molecule was constructed (Fig. 1) based on the variable region of the humanized anti-CD4 antibody TNX-355 (also known as Hu5A8) (10Boon L. Holland B. Gordon W. Liu P. Shiau F. Shanahan W. Reimann K.A. Fung M. Toxicology. 2002; 172: 191-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and the HIV-1 fusion inhibitor peptide T-651v. The HIV entry inhibitor TNX-355 has demonstrated efficacy in cell culture and in patients (11Kuritzkes D.R. Jacobson J. Powderly W.G. Godofsky E. DeJesus E. Haas F. Reimann K.A. Larson J.L.

https://openalex.org/W2030417637,"Catalysis of tRNA(Tyr) aminoacylation by tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase can be divided into two steps. In the first step, tyrosine is activated by ATP to form the tyrosyl-adenylate intermediate. In the second step, the tyrosyl moiety is transferred to the 3' end of tRNA. To investigate the roles that enthalpic and entropic contributions play in catalysis by Bacillus stearothermophilus tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (TyrRS), the temperature dependence for the activation of tyrosine and subsequent transfer to tRNA(Tyr) has been determined using single turnover kinetic methods. A van't Hoff plot for binding of ATP to the TyrRS.Tyr complex reveals three distinct regions. Particularly striking is the change occurring at 25 degrees C, where the values of DeltaH(0) and DeltaS(0) go from -144 kJ/mol and -438 J/mol K below 25 degrees C to +137.9 kJ/mol and +507 J/mol K above 25 degrees C. Nonlinear Eyring and van't Hoff plots are also observed for formation of the TyrRS.[Tyr-ATP](double dagger) and TyrRS.Tyr-AMP complexes. Comparing the van't Hoff plots for the binding of ATP to tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase in the absence and presence of saturating tyrosine concentrations indicates that the temperature-dependent changes in DeltaH(0) and DeltaS(0) for the binding of ATP only occur when tyrosine is bound to the enzyme. Previous investigations revealed a similar synergistic interaction between the tyrosine and ATP substrates when the ""KMSKS"" signature sequence is deleted or replaced by a nonfunctional sequence. We propose that the temperature-dependent changes in DeltaH(0) and DeltaS(0) are because of the KMSKS signature sequence being conformationally constrained and unable to disrupt this synergistic interaction below 25 degrees C."
https://openalex.org/W2053777143,"A novel humanized mouse model of Cooley's Anemia (CA) was generated by targeted gene replacement in embryonic stem (ES) cells. Because the mouse does not have a true fetal hemoglobin, a delayed switching human γ to β0 globin gene cassette (γβ0) was inserted directly into the murine β globin locus replacing both adult mouse β globin genes. The inserted human β0 globin allele has a mutation in the splice donor site that produces the same aberrant transcripts in mice as described in human cells. No functional human β globin polypeptide chains are produced. Heterozygous γβ0 mice suffer from microcytic anemia. Unlike previously described animal models of β thalassemia major, homozygous γβ0 mice switch from mouse embryonic globin chains to human fetal γ globin during fetal life. When bred with human α globin knockin mice, homozygous CA mice survive solely upon human fetal hemoglobin at birth. This preclinical animal model of CA can be utilized to study the regulation of globin gene expression, synthesis, and switching; the reactivation of human fetal globin gene expression; and the testing of genetic and cell-based therapies for the correction of thalassemia.

Frequently these mutations occur at splice sites that reduce (β+ thalassemia) or eliminate (β0 thalassemia) β chain production from a single mutated allele (β thalassemia minor) resulting in asymptomatic or mild anemia. Mutations of both alleles (β thalassemia major) result in severe disease that ranges from anemia requiring sporadic transfusion (thalassemia intermedia) to chronic transfusion dependence and progressive organ damage (Cooley's Anemia, CA 2The abbreviations used are: CA, Cooley's Anemia; ES, embryonic stem; γβ0, delayed switching human γ to β0 globin gene cassette; Hb, hemoglobin; LCR, locus control region; E12, embryonic day 12; KO, knockout; KI, knockin; HbF, fetal hemoglobin; RDW, red blood cell distribution width; PCV, packed cell volume; MCV, mean corpuscular volume; MCH, mean corpuscular hemoglobin; MCHC, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration; IVS1.1, first base of intervening sequence 1; QPCR, quantitative real-time RT-PCR; SV, splice variant; BAC, bacterial artificial chromosome.2The abbreviations used are: CA, Cooley's Anemia; ES, embryonic stem; γβ0, delayed switching human γ to β0 globin gene cassette; Hb, hemoglobin; LCR, locus control region; E12, embryonic day 12; KO, knockout; KI, knockin; HbF, fetal hemoglobin; RDW, red blood cell distribution width; PCV, packed cell volume; MCV, mean corpuscular volume; MCH, mean corpuscular hemoglobin; MCHC, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration; IVS1.1, first base of intervening sequence 1; QPCR, quantitative real-time RT-PCR; SV, splice variant; BAC, bacterial artificial chromosome.)

The anemia that results from this ineffective erythropoiesis stimulates the expansion of more progenitors producing erythroid hyperplasia and extramedullary hematopoiesis. The β globin loci of both humans and mice are controlled by a powerful regulatory region called the locus control region (LCR) that lies far upstream of the adult β globin genes and is demarcated by a series of erythroid specific developmentally stable DNaseI hypersensitive sites (8Forrester W.C.

In humans there are five functional β-like globin genes (∊, Gγ, Aγ, δ, and β) while in the mouse there are four genes (∊Y, βh1, βmaj, and βmin) located at each β globin locus. There are two β-like Hb switches in humans that occur during development (12Nienhuis A.W. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Cell. 1978; 15: 307-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The first switch occurs when the major hematopoietic site shifts from primitive erythropoiesis in the yolk sac blood islands to definitive erythropoiesis in the fetal liver. Concomitant with this shift in the site of hematopoiesis is a switch from the production of embryonic ∊ globin chains to fetal γ globin chains. The second human Hb switch takes place around birth when the major site of hematopoiesis shifts from the fetal liver to the bone marrow. Erythrocytes that contain mostly fetal γ globin chains at birth are gradually replaced by red blood cells containing the major (β) and minor (δ) adult globins over the first year of life. A variety of natural occurring and experimentally engineered mouse models of β thalassemia have been described (13Skow L.C. Burkhart B.A. Johnson F.M. Popp R.A. Popp D.M. Goldberg S.Z. Anderson W.F.

The major problem encountered when modeling human hemoglobin disorders in the mouse is that the developmental timing of Hb switching in humans and mice are different. The mouse has no fetal Hb gene equivalent (21Kingsley P.D. Malik J. Emerson R.L. Bushnell T.P. McGrath K.E. Bloedorn L.A. Bulger M. Palis J.

The embryonic, z and y chains, synthesized from the βh1 and ∊Y globin genes, respectively, are sequentially expressed and synthesized in maturing circulating primitive erythroid cells that were produced in the yolk sac blood islands. The onset of definitive erythropoiesis begins around embryonic day 12 (E12) when the major site of hematopoiesis shifts to the fetal liver in the mouse (21Kingsley P.D. Malik J. Emerson R.L.

These definitive erythrocytes synthesize the adult β globin genes, βmaj and βmin, early in fetal development and become the sole β globin chain synthesized from E15 through adulthood. Thus, due to the lack of a fetal globin gene equivalent, βmaj and βmin globin knock-out (KO) mice die around 1 week before birth (15Ciavatta D.J. Ryan T.M. Farmer S.C. Townes T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9259-9263Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Here we report a novel CA mouse model made by targeted gene replacement of both adult mouse β globin genes with a delayed switching human γ to β0 globin gene cassette. Heterozygous γβ0 knockin (KI) mice exhibit β thalassemia intermedia. After breeding to human α globin KI mice, humanized homozygous CA mice survive solely upon human fetal Hb, HbF, during fetal life and expire due to severe anemia upon completion of the Hb switch after birth. Targeting Construct and ES Cell Culture—Targeting plasmid, from 5′ to 3′, contains 1.7 kb of mouse homology upstream of the mouse βmaj globin gene (HindIII fragment), 5.7 kb human Aγ globin gene fragment (GenBank™ Accession No. U01317: 38,066–43,728), 4.1 kb human β globin gene fragment (GenBank™ Accession No. U01317: 61,320–65,426), a phosphoglycerate kinase promoter driving a hygromycin resistance gene (hyg) flanked by two loxP sites, and 7 kb of mouse homology downstream of the mouse βmin globin gene (BamHI fragment). G to A mutation was introduced into the first base of intron 1 of human β globin gene by PCR. The targeting plasmid was linearized by NotI digestion and electroporated into human γβ KI hprt “tagged” ES cells 3T. M. Ryan, unpublished data. (23Wu L.C. Sun C.W. Ryan T.M. Pawlik K.M. Ren J. Townes T.M. Blood. 2006; 108: 1183-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The ES cells were plated on mitomycin C-treated mouse embryonic fibroblasts monolayer in ES cell medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium), 15% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT), 1× nucleosides, 2 mm l-glutamine, 1× nonessential amino acids, 50 international units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1000 units/ml leukemia inhibitory factor). Hygromycin B (125 μg/ml) was added to the ES medium 36 h after electroporation and replenished every other day until colonies were picked. 6-thioguanine (2 μm) was added to the ES medium 4 or 5 days after electroporation to select against cells that still contain the hprt “tagged” locus and enrich for homologous recombinants. ES cell colonies that were resistant to both hygromycin B and 6-thioguanine were picked, expanded, and frozen. DNA aliquots from ES cell colonies were screened by PCR to identify human γβ0 homologous recombinants. Chimera Production and Breeding—Correctly targeted human γβ0 KI ES cells were injected into 3.5-day-old C57BL/6J (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) blastocysts that were transferred into the uteri of outbred CD1 (Charles River Laboratories, Inc., Wilmington, MA) pseudopregnant recipient mice for the production of chimeras (supplemental Fig. S1A). Chimeric mice were bred to C57BL/6J to produce F1 heterozygous γβ0 KI offspring (supplemental Fig. S1B). The hygromycin marker gene was deleted by breeding to CMV-Cre transgenic mice (24Nozaki M. Ohishi K. Yamada N. Kinoshita T. Nagy A. Takeda J. Lab. Investig. 1999; 79: 293-299PubMed Google Scholar). Homozygous γβ0 KI mice were produced by breeding two heterozygous KI mice. All procedures were approved by the University of Alabama at Birmingham's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. RNA Splice Site Determination—Total RNA was isolated from the peripheral blood of γβ0 KI mice using TRIzol LS reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Total peripheral blood RNA was digested by RNase-free DNaseI (New England Biolab) before further usage. RT-PCR was performed on the RNA using random primers and MLV-reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Two primers were used to simultaneously amplify all the splicing variants by PCR: hβ32 For (5′-ACGAAGCTTACTAGCAACCTCAAACAGACACCA-3′) and hβ162 Rev (5′-ACGAAGCTTTCCAAGGGTAGACCACCAGCA-3′). PCR amplification products were digested by HindIII endonuclease and resolved by PAGE on an 8% polyacrylamide/bis-acrylamide (29:1) gel. All the bands were eluted and subcloned into the HindIII site of pBluescript SK phagemid (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The nucleotide sequence of the plasmid inserts was determined at the UAB Heflin Center for Human Genetics DNA Sequencing core facility. Hematological Indices and Histopathology—Peripheral blood was collected from anesthetized mice into Microtainer® EDTA collection tubes (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Red blood cell counts and red blood cell distribution widths (RDW) were measured on a HemaVet® 1700 (Drew Scientific, Waterbury, CT) hematology analyzer. Packed cell volume (PCV) was measured in a JorVet J503 (Jorgenson Laboratories Systems, Loveland, CO) micro-hematocrit centrifuge. Hb concentrations were determined after conversion to cyanmethemoglobin by lysing red blood cells in Drabkin's Reagent (Sigma), removal of insoluble erythrocyte membranes by centrifugation, measuring the absorbance at 540 nm on a spectrophotometer, and comparison to Hb standards. The mean corpuscular volume (MCV), hemoglobin (MCH), and hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) were calculated from the red blood cell count, Hb concentration, and PCV measurements. Reticulocyte counts were determined by flow cytometry after staining with thiazole orange (25Ferguson D.J. Lee S.F. Gordon P.A. Am. J. Hematol. 1990; 33: 13-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Tissues were fixed in 70% alcoholic formalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin-eosin by standard methods at the UAB Comparative Pathology Laboratory. Transmission electron microscopy was performed at the UAB High Resolution Imaging Facility. In brief, peripheral blood was fixed in buffered glutaraldehyde, post-fixed in osmium tetroxide, embedded in Epon 812, sections were post-stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, viewed with a Tecnai T12 Spirit Twin (FEI Company, Hillboro, OR) at 60kV, and images were captured with a AMT XR60B digital camera (Danvers, MA). HPLC Analysis of Hemoglobin Chains—Hemolysates are prepared by lysing washed red blood cells in hemolysate buffer (5 mm phosphate, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 7.4), adding NaCl to 1%, and removal of membranes by centrifugation. A linear gradient of increasing acetonitrile with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a 1.0 ml/min flow rate was used to separate human and mouse globin chains on a reverse phase C4 column (Vydac, Inc., Hesperia, CA) on a Surveyor HPLC instrument (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). Blood from humanized γβA KI mice 3T. M. Ryan, unpublished data. is used for a control in Fig. 5. Quantitative Real-time RT-PCR (QPCR) Expression Analysis of Globin Chains—cDNA was generated using the High Capacity cDNA Archive Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with random hexamers and 500 ng of total peripheral blood RNA. Real-time PCR reactions contained ABI Taqman Universal Mastermix, 900 nm primers, 200 nm probe, and typically 2 μl of 1000-fold diluted cDNA in a 20-μl total volume. Reactions were run on a 7900HT Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). Sequences of primers and probes used are listed in Table 1. Mouse α, mouse β, and human α globin primer and probe sets measure total expression from both alleles of their respective adult genes. Experiments were performed in triplicate with a 384-well optical plate, and the standard error of the mean from three to ten biological replicates is calculated. Expression was calculated using measured efficiencies (26Pfaffl M.W.

To mimic this condition in the mouse, we introduced a delayed switching human γ to β0 globin gene cassette directly into the mouse β globin locus (Fig. 1A). The β0 globin allele used contains a single G to A nucleotide transition in the first base of intervening sequence 1 (IVS1.1 G to A) that accounts for 13% of β0 thalassemia mutations in the Mediterranean population (27Kollia P. Karababa P.H. Sinopoulou K. Voskaridou E. Boussiou M. Papadakis M. Loukopoulos D. Gene Geogr. 1992; 6: 59-70PubMed Google Scholar). DNA from these γβ0 KI mice was sequenced to confirm the mutation in the human β globin gene (supplemental Fig. S1C). Analyses of the murine β globin locus by Southern blotting confirmed that the delayed switching human γβ0 cassette was inserted in place of the adult mouse β globin genes (Fig. 1, B and C). The Mutant Human β0 Globin Gene Produces Aberrantly Spliced Transcripts in Vivo—Treisman et al. reported that transfected cell lines containing a β globin gene with an IVS1.1 G to A splice donor site mutation produces aberrantly spliced mRNAs (28Treisman R. Orkin S.H. Maniatis T. Nature. 1983; 302: 591-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Loss of the normal GT dinucleotide splice donor resulted in the activation of three cryptic splice donor sites, two upstream in the first exon and one downstream in the first intron. Use of these cryptic splice sites produces altered mRNA transcripts that result in no functional β globin polypeptide synthesis from this allele. In order to determine how the mutant human β0 globin gene transcripts were spliced in the mouse, peripheral blood RNA from γβ0 KI mice were amplified by PCR using human β globin-specific primers, hBeta32 For and hBeta162 Rev, that flank the first exon and most of the second exon (Fig. 2C). Amplified PCR products were resolved by PAGE (Fig. 2A, lane 4), excised, subcloned, and sequenced. Three splice variants were identified that utilized cryptic GT splice donor sites (Fig. 2A, lanes 1–3). This demonstrates that the G to A splice donor site mutation in the human β0 globin KI allele prevents normal splicing, and the murine splicing machinery uses alternative cryptic splice donor sites in vivo. Humanized CA Mice Switch from Mouse Embryonic to Human Fetal Hb during Development—The human γβ0 KI mice were analyzed to determine whether the human globin genes would be expressed at high levels in a temporally regulated way when inserted 30-kb downstream of the LCR in the murine β globin locus. Expression of both human and mouse globin genes were studied at the protein and RNA levels in developing γβ0 globin KI mice. Fetal blood RNA and hemolysates were prepared from γβ0 globin KI and wild-type littermate controls from embryonic day 10.5 (E10.5) through adulthood (Fig. 3). Heterozygous γβ0 globin KI mice express high levels of human γ globin during development (Fig. 3A). In E10.5 primitive erythrocytes human γ globin levels represent about 19% of the total β-like globin gene mRNA per gene copy. During definitive hematopoiesis in the fetal liver, human γ globin levels rise to 30% of total β-like globin mRNA from E14.5 through E16.5 (Fig. 3A). As the human fetal gene switches to the nonfunctional human β0 allele the levels drop to 5% at birth and to less than 1% by weaning age of the adult mouse β globin genes (Fig. 3A). The aberrantly spliced mRNA variants produced from the mutant human β0 allele are detectable, but very short lived representing only a fraction of a percent (0.5%) of total β-like mRNA at birth (supplemental Table S1, Part A). The human β0 globin transcripts increase slightly in adult blood reticulocytes (0.6%) to levels that are 3-fold higher than the final human γ globin expression level (0.2%, supplemental Table S1, Part A). Higher levels of human β0 globin mRNA are found in erythroblasts in the adult bone marrow (1.8%, supplemental Table S1, Part A). The expression of the murine embryonic globin genes, βh1 and ∊Y, are silenced during development in the heterozygous γβ0 globin KI mice (Fig. 3A). The murine βh1 globin genes are expressed at high levels in primitive erythrocytes at E10.5 (30%), but are silenced by E14.5 (0.4%). Likewise, the expression of the murine ∊Y globin genes are 50% of total β-like globin mRNA in primitive erythrocytes at E10.5, but are silenced by E16.5 (0.1%). The predominant β-like globin mRNA present from E14.5 into adulthood is transcribed from the endogenous adult mouse β globin genes from the wild-type non-targeted β globin locus. The adult murine β globin transcripts increase throughout fetal life and represent over 99% of total β-like globin chains in adult heterozygous γβ0 globin KI mice. The individual globin polypeptide chain levels in the heterozygous γβ0 globin KI mice mirror the expression data described above; however, they lag the mRNA levels by about 2 days of development (Fig. 3B). The mouse embryonic y chain synthesized from the ∊Y globin gene is the major chain present at E14.5, but decreases to background level of total β-like globin chains per gene copy by birth. Human γ globin chains reach their peak level of 39% on E16.5 and then slowly decrease to 36% of total β-like globin protein in newborn mice. Thus, heterozygous human γβ0 globin KI mice maintain high levels of human γ globin chains during fetal life that represent approximately one-third of total chains at birth. Fetal blood RNA and hemolysates from homozygous CA embryos (γβ0/γβ0) were also analyzed by QPCR and HPLC (Fig. 3, C and D). The data demonstrate the completion of a mouse ∊Y globin to human γ globin switch from E14.5 to E16.5 (Fig. 3C). The mouse ∊Y globin gene mRNA levels drop from 40% on E14.5 to 2% on E16.5. The human γ globin gene mRNA levels are the predominant β-like globin gene expressed during fetal life increasing from 60% at E14.5 to 96% by E16.5. While the human γ globin mRNA levels represent the majority of all β-like globin gene expression during late fetal life, the percentage of total mouse α-like globin to total β-like globin mRNA increases during this period as the γ globin genes switch to the nonfunctional human β0 globin genes that have a relatively short-lived mRNA (supplemental Table S1, Part B). Thus, erythroid cells become increasingly thalassemic during late fetal life in the homozygous γβ0 KI fetuses. At the protein level there is a clear Hb switch from mouse embryonic globin chains to human fetal chains during development in homozygous γβ0 KI mice (Fig. 3D). As the murine embryonic y chains decrease from E14.5 to E18.5 there is a reciprocal rise in the human γ globin chain levels. The human γ globin chains increase from 19% in E14.5 fetuses to the predominant β-like chain present in fetal blood at E16.5 and to 76% of β-like chains at E18.5 shortly before their death (Fig. 3D). At their time of death these CA mice must survive upon mouse α/human γ hybrid Hb, mα2hγ2, which has an extremely high oxygen affinity (29Nishino T. Cao H. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Emery D.W. Br. J. Haematol. 2006; 134: 100-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Humanized CA Mice Have a Severe β Thalassemic Phenotype—Heterozygous adult human γβ0 globin KI mice are anemic and exhibit β thalassemia intermedia phenotypes due to the replacement of their wild-type β globin alleles with the nonfunctional human β0 globin gene. Peripheral blood smears shows a marked anisopoikilocytosis with numerous targeted and hypochromic red blood cells (Fig. 4A). Excess α globin chains form inclusions that are easily seen after vital staining (supplemental Fig. S2) or by electron microscopy (Fig. 4B). Red blood cell indices demonstrate that the γβ0 KI mice have a microcytic anemia with significant reductions in the PCV and Hb levels compared with wild-type controls (Table 2). This anemia causes an increase in the production and early release of nascent macrocytic red blood cells, reticulocytes, from hematopoietic tissues into the circulation that results in a 9-fold increase in the reticulocyte count above normal levels. Overall there is a 14% reduction in circulating red blood cell MCV as reticuloendothelial cells remove excess α globin chain inclusions by “pitting” (30Forget B.G. Nathan D.G. Annu. Rev. Med. 1975; 26: 345-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). This simultaneous mixture of macrocytic reticulocytes and mature microcytic red blood cells causes a doubling in the measured RDW. Other changes observed include significant decreases in the red blood cell count, MCH, and MCHC levels (Table 2).TABLE 2Heterozygous human γβ0 globin KI mice have β thalassemic red blood cell indicesMicenRBCPCVHbMCVMCHMCHCReticRDW106/μl%g/dlflpgg/dl%%Wild type88.8 ± 0.243.8 ± 0.813.8 ± 0.450.3 ± 0.815.6 ± 0.429.2 ± 0.62.1 ± 0.216.1 ± 0.2γβ0/+ KI117.3 ± 0.2ap < .0001.31.3 ± 0.7ap < .0001.7.9 ± 0.2ap < .0001.43.3 ± 1.0ap < .0001.10.9 ± 0.2ap < .0001.25.2 ± 0.4ap < .0001.19.6 ± 2.1ap < .0001.34.1 ± 0.7ap < .0001.a p < .0001.

The femoral bone marrow cavities are enlarged and filled with erythroid progenitors in the heterozygous γβ0 globin KI mice (supplemental Fig. S2). Splenomegaly, measured as a percentage of the adult animal's body weight, is increased 6-fold as normal splenic architecture of red and white pulp is disorganized by expansion of erythroid progenitor cells in response to their severe anemia (Fig. 4, A and C). Extramedullary hematopoiesis is present as clusters of maturing erythroid precursors in the liver of heterozygous γβ0 globin KI mice (Fig. 4A). Lastly, the early destruction of erythroid cells leads to an increased deposition of iron in the erythroid tissues of the bone marrow, liver, and spleen (supplemental Fig. S2 and data not shown). Heterozygous CA mice were bred together to generate homozygous γβ0 KI mice to examine their viability through embryonic development. Pregnancies were terminated at various gestational times and the fetuses were removed for genotyping. There was no significant loss of either heterozygous or homozygous γβ0 KI mice up to embryonic day 18.5 in 14 litters analyzed (supplemental Table S2). Additionally, though heterozygous γβ0 globin KI mice suffer from β thalassemia intermedia, no significant survival disadvantage was observed in the heterozygotes by 3 weeks of age at the time of weaning in 15 litters analyzed (supplemental Table S2). Longer term survival studies will need to be performed to determine if the adult heterozygous CA mice have a shortened lifespan. Homozygous γβ0 KI mice did not survive to birth. Although homozygous fetuses express high levels of human γ globin late in fetal life, these chains must dimerize with mouse α globin to form mouse/human hybrid dimers and Hb tetramers. This mouse/human hybrid Hb, mα2/hγ2, may be unstable and has an extremely high oxygen affinity that may affect the"
https://openalex.org/W1976077617,"Mot1 is an essential TATA-binding protein (TBP)-associated factor and Snf2/Swi2 ATPase that both represses and activates transcription. Biochemical and structural results support a model in which ATP binding and hydrolysis induce a conformational change in Mot1 that drives local translocation along DNA, thus removing TBP. Although this activity explains transcriptional repression, it does not as easily explain Mot1-mediated transcriptional activation, and several different models have been proposed to explain how Mot1 activates transcription. To better understand the function of Mot1 in yeast cells in vivo, particularly with regard to gene activation, TBP mutants were identified that bypass the requirement for Mot1 in vivo. Although TBP has been extensively mutated and analyzed previously, this screen uncovered two novel TBP variants that are unique in their ability to bypass the requirement for Mot1. Surprisingly, in vitro analyses reveal that rather than having acquired an improved biochemical activity, one of the TBPs was defective for interaction with polymerase II preinitiation complex (PIC) components and other regulators of TBP function. The other mutant was defective for DNA binding in vitro yet was still recruited to chromatin in vivo. These results suggest that Mot1-mediated dissociation of TBP (or TBP-containing complexes) from chromatin can explain the Mot1 activation mechanism at some promoters. The results also suggest that PICs can be dynamically unstable and that appropriate PIC instability is critical for the regulation of transcription in vivo."
