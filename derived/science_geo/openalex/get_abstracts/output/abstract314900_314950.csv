https://openalex.org/W1613132185,"Archaeologists are mulling over tantalizing images of what appears to have been a house of wood and mud littered with human artifacts now 91 meters beneath the Black Sea. The find lends further credence to the claims of two oceanographers that a torrent equaling 200 Niagara Falls cascaded from the Mediterranean Sea 7500 years ago, driving Neolithic peoples living along the Black Sea coastline inland. But whether the catastrophe gave rise to the biblical account of Noah's Flood and spread farming into central Europe, as the researchers speculate, we can't yet say."

https://openalex.org/W1514909811,"Since the discovery of the first asteroid almost 200 years ago, these celestial bodies have advanced from nuisances hampering stellar studies to the focus of geological studies aimed at understanding the early solar system. Binzel describes the history of their study, which has now culminated in NASA's NEAR mission to the asteroid Eros. Four papers report first results from this first rendezvous mission with an asteroid."
https://openalex.org/W1609475953,"Advances in mesoscopic physics are enabling fundamental properties of solids to be studied at an unprecedented level of detail. In his Perspective, von Delft highlights the study by van der Wiel et al., who have demonstrated almost complete screening of the local spin of a quantum dot. This behavior mirrors the well-known Kondo effect for magnetic impurities in metals. Because they are tunable, quantum dots allow detailed tests of models for the Kondo effect, but experiments are ahead of theory at this time."

https://openalex.org/W1535691563,"The House and Senate are working out a final 2001 budget plan that should leave NASA with a small increase over this year. But the increase will be more than swallowed up by projects costing hundreds of millions of dollars that politicians have added to satisfy their constituents. At the same time, rising mission costs in the wake of two recent Mars failures are forcing agency officials to steal money from lower priority efforts such as a trip to Pluto. The two trends, warn NASA and science community officials, could prove devastating to NASA's space science efforts."
https://openalex.org/W1562540582,"If Nobel Prizes and journal citations are gold standards, Dutch science is on a high. But critics warn that the scientific community has already begun to lose its edge. During the past 2 decades, the Netherlands has stopped being a top science spender, scientific careers have gone out of fashion, and women's participation in science remains appallingly low--a situation that some experts predict will soon lead to a steep shortage of researchers."
https://openalex.org/W1634870030,"After 11 years of banging electrons and positrons together at higher energies than any other machine in the world, CERN, the European laboratory for particle physics, had decided to shut down the Large Electron-Positron collider (LEP) and install a new machine, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), in its 27-kilometer tunnel. In 2005, the LHC will start bashing protons together at even higher energies. But tantalizing hints of a long-sought fundamental particle have forced CERN managers to grant LEP a month's reprieve."

Last week, the E.U.'s top two research officials said they are pushing for big changes in the successor to Europe's 5-year, $17 billion Framework 5, including stronger efforts to coordinate research across the continent and to support innovative projects."
https://openalex.org/W1552591992,"A New York congressman who sided with environmentalists to kill a nuclear research reactor at Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, New York, has been defeated in a stunning primary upset. Representative Michael Forbes lost last week by a narrow margin to Regina Seltzer, the 71-year-old widow of a Brookhaven chemist. The defeat is welcome news to many Brookhaven scientists."
https://openalex.org/W1563039777,"For those considering a soft-money position, either as a temporary or permanent career move, researchers and administrators advise going in with your eyes wide open and well informed about the specifics of your situation. Science offers some of their suggestions."
https://openalex.org/W1621031216,"In 1988, experimental geophysicists Quentin Williams and Elise Knittle were facing the ""two-body problem"": husband-and-wife job candidates in the same field needing jobs in the same geographical area. The offer that intrigued them most was from the department of earth sciences at the University of California, Santa Cruz: a tenure-track position for Knittle and a soft-money slot for Williams at the department-affiliated Institute of Tectonics. They chose Santa Cruz in part, says Knittle, because UCSC offered a better setup package, which would enable them to get up and running faster."
https://openalex.org/W1943420880,"When University of California, Irvine, developmental biologist Susan Bryant married David Gardiner, Gardiner took a soft-money position as a researcher at Irvine. Because Gardiner was flexible in his goals and committed to raising children, it seemed a better choice than trying to get two jobs somewhere else, he recalls. And 17 years and two children later, Gardiner says that decision was right for them as a couple--and that he has learned to endure the indignities that come with the territory."

https://openalex.org/W1974653940,"NASA scientists and engineers working on the Next Generation Space Telescope (NGST) got a boost from across the Atlantic last week. On 15 September in Paris, the European Space Agency's top science advisory committee recommended that the agency become a major partner in the project. The recommendation puts NGST--along with a handful of other missions the committee also endorsed last week--one short step away from officially becoming part of Europe's space program."
