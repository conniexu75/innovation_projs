https://openalex.org/W1535433473,"Culture materials and grains contaminated with certain isolates of Fusarium moniliforme cause equine leucoencephalomalacia, porcine pulmonary edema syndrome, and liver cancer in rats. The causative agents are thought to be a family of compounds called fumonisins, which bear considerable structural similarity to the long-chain (sphingoid) base backbones of sphingolipids. Incubation of rat hepatocytes with fumonisins inhibited incorporation of [14C]serine into the sphingosine moiety of cellular sphingolipids with an IC50 of 0.1 microM for fumonisin B1. In contrast, fumonisin B1 increased the amount of the biosynthetic intermediate sphinganine, which suggests that fumonisins inhibit the conversion of [14C]sphinganine to N-acyl-[14C]sphinganines, a step that is thought to precede introduction of the 4,5-trans double bond of sphingosine (Merrill, A.H., Jr. and Wang, E. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 3764-3769). In agreement with this mechanism, fumonisin B1 inhibited the activity of sphingosine N-acyltransferase (ceramide synthase) in rat liver microsomes with 50% inhibition at approximately 0.1 microM and reduced the conversion of [3H]sphingosine to [3H]ceramide by intact hepatocytes. As far as we are aware, this is the first discovery of a naturally occurring inhibitor of this step of sphingolipid metabolism. These findings suggest that disruption of the de novo pathway of sphingolipid biosynthesis may be a critical event in the diseases that have been associated with consumption of fumonisins."

Intensive study of one phenomenon of English grammar and how it is processed and acquired suggest that both theories are partly right. Regular verbs (walk-walked) are computed by a suffixation rule in a neural system for grammatical processing; irregular verbs (run-ran) are retrieved from an associative memory."

https://openalex.org/W1993418815,"Several proteins have been shown to be post-translationally modified on a specific C-terminal cysteine residue by either of two isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway metabolites, farnesyl diphosphate or geranylgeranyl diphosphate. Three enzymes responsible for protein isoprenylation were resolved chromatographically from the cytosolic fraction of bovine brain: a farnesyl-protein transferase (FTase), which modified the cell-transforming Ras protein, and two geranyl-geranyl-protein transferases, one (GGTase-I) which modified a chimeric Ras having the C-terminal amino acid sequence of the gamma-6 subunit of heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins, and the other (GGTase-II) which modified the Saccharomyces cerevisiae secretory GTPase protein YPT1. In a S. cerevisiae strain lacking FTase activity (ram1), both GGTases were detected at wild-type levels. In a ram2 S. cerevisiae strain devoid of FTase activity, GGTase-I activity was reduced by 67%, suggesting that GGTase-I and FTase activities derive from different enzymes but may share a common genetic feature. For the FTase and the GGTase-I activities, the C-terminal amino acid sequence of the protein substrate, the CAAX box, appeared to contain all the critical determinants for interaction with the transferase. In fact, tetrapeptides with amino acid sequences identical to the C-terminal sequences of the protein substrates for FTase or GGTase-I competed for protein isoprenylation by acting as alternative substrates. Changes in the CAAX amino acid sequence of protein substrates markedly altered their ability to serve as substrates for both FTase and GGTase-I. In addition, it appeared that FTase and GGTase-I had complementary affinities for CAAX protein substrates; that is, CAAX proteins that were good substrates for FTase were, in general, poor substrates for GGTase-I, and vice versa. In particular, a leucine residue at the C terminus influenced whether a CAAX protein was either farnesylated or geranylgeranylated preferentially. The YPT1 C terminus peptide, TGGGCC, did not compete or serve as a substrate for GGTase-II, indicating that the interaction between GGTase-II and YPT1 appeared to depend on more than the 6 C-terminal residues of the protein substrate sequence. These results identify three different isoprenyl-protein transferases that are each selective for their isoprenoid and protein substrates."
https://openalex.org/W2048916976,"The incorporation of 2′-fluoro- and 2′-aminonucleotides into a hammerhead ribozyme was accomplished by automated chemical synthesis. The presence of 2′-fluorouridines, 2′-fluorocytidines, or 2′-aminouridines did not appreciably decrease catalytic efficiency. Incorporation of 2′-aminocytidines decreased ribozyme activity approximately by a factor of 20. The replacement of all adenosines with 2′-fluoroadenosines abolished catalysis in the presence of MgCl2 within the limits of detection, but some activity was retained in the presence of MnCl2. This effect on catalysis was localized to a specific group of adenines within the conserved single-stranded region of the ribozyme. The decrease in catalytic efficiency was caused by a decrease in the rate constant; the Michaelis constant was unaltered. The 2′-fluoro and 2′-amino modifications conferred resistance toward ribonuclease degradation. Ribozymes containing 2′-fluoro- or 2′-aminonucleotides at all uridine and cytidine positions were stabilized against degradation in rabbit serum by a factor of at least 103 compared to unmodified ribozyme."
https://openalex.org/W2137096206,"The type II cAMP-dependent protein kinase is localized to specific subcellular environments through the binding of the regulatory subunit (RII) dimer to RII-anchoring proteins. Computer-aided analysis of secondary structure, performed on four RII-anchoring protein sequences (the microtubule-associated protein 2, P150, and two thyroid proteins Ht 21 and Ht 31), has identified common regions of approximately 14 residues which display high probabilities of forming amphipathic helices. The potential amphipathic helix region of Ht 31 (Leu-Ile-Glu-Glu-Ala-Ala-Ser-Arg-Ile-Val-Asp-Ala-Val-Ile) lies between residues 494 and 507. A bacterially expressed 318-amino acid fragment, Ht 31 (418-736), containing the amphipathic helix region, was able to bind RII alpha. Site-directed mutagenesis designed to disrupt the secondary structure in the putative binding helix reduced binding dramatically. Specifically, substitution of proline for Ala-498 significantly diminished RII alpha binding, and similar mutation of Ile-502 or Ile-507 abolished interaction. Mutation of Ala-522 to proline, which is located outside the predicted amphipathic helix region, had no effect on RII alpha binding. These data suggest that anchoring proteins interact with RII alpha via an amphipathic helix binding motif."

https://openalex.org/W1998919839,"To determine the role of the BCR-ABL gene in the proliferation of blast cells of patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia, leukemia blast cells were exposed to synthetic 18-mer oligodeoxynucleotides complementary to two identified BCR-ABL junctions. Leukemia colony formation was suppressed, whereas granulocyte-macrophage colony formation from normal marrow progenitors was unaffected. When equal proportions of normal marrow progenitors and blast cells were mixed, exposed to the oligodeoxynucleotides, and assayed for residual colony formation, the majority of residual cells were normal. These findings demonstrate the requirement for a functional BCR-ABL gene in maintaining the leukemic phenotype and the feasibility of gene-targeted selective killing of neoplastic cells."
https://openalex.org/W1544265936,"A plasmid (palb3) was constructed containing the structural gene for human serum albumin driven by mouse albumin enhancer-rat albumin promoter elements. Using an asialoglycoprotein-polycation conjugate consisting of asialoorosomucoid coupled to poly-L-lysine, a soluble DNA complex was formed that was capable of targeting specifically to hepatocytes via asialoglycoprotein receptors present on these cells. Groups of Nagase analbuminemic rats were injected with complexed DNA or controls, followed by two-thirds partial hepatectomy to stimulate hepatocyte replication. Using a cDNA probe for the human albumin structural gene, hybridizable sequences were detected in analbuminemic rats treated with complex as determined by Southern blot analysis. Two weeks post-injection, the targeted DNA was found to exist primarily in plasmid form with an average copy number of 1000/diploid cell. Human albumin mRNA was detected by dot-blot hybridization with a specific oligonucleotide cDNA probe and confirmed by RNase protection assay using a vector-specific probe. Circulating human albumin was detected in the serum of palb3-treated Nagase analbuminemic rats by Western blots using an antibody specific for human serum albumin. A time course demonstrated that circulating human albumin was not detectable 24 h after injection, but became measurable at a level of 0.05 micrograms/ml within 48 h and increased in concentration to a maximum of 34 micrograms/ml by 2 weeks post-injection. This level of expression remained stable through 4 weeks after injection and partial hepatectomy."

https://openalex.org/W1983217982,"It is widely thought that animals switch gaits at speeds that minimize energetic cost. Horses naturally switched from a trot to a gallop at a speed where galloping required more energy than trotting, and thus, the gait transition actually increased the energetic cost of running. However, by galloping at this speed, the peak forces on the muscles, tendons, and bones, and presumably the chance of injury, are reduced. When the horses carried weights, they switched from a trot to a gallop at a lower speed but at the same critical level of force. These findings suggest that the trot-gallop transition is triggered when musculoskeletal forces reach a critical level."

https://openalex.org/W1978827094,"Heterogeneous nuclear RNAs and specific nuclear proteins form heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein complexes (hnRNPs), one of the most abundant components of the nucleus. In mitosis, as the nuclear envelope breaks down, hnRNPs disperse throughout the cell. At the end of mitosis, hnRNPs dissociate and their proteins are transported into the daughter cell nuclei separately. Some are transported immediately (early group), while others are transported later (late group). Transport of the late group appears to require transcription by RNA polymerase II, in that inhibitors of this polymerase cause the late proteins to remain in the cytoplasm. Thus, there are two modes, transcription-dependent and transcription-independent, for the transport of nuclear proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2019945905,"Modulation of the activity of potassium and other ion channels is an essential feature of nervous system function. The open probability of a large conductance Ca(2+)-activated K+ channel from rat brain, incorporated into planar lipid bilayers, is increased by the addition of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to the cytoplasmic side of the channel. This modulation takes place without the addition of protein kinase, requires Mg2+, and is mimicked by an ATP analog that serves as a substrate for protein kinases but not by a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog. Addition of protein phosphatase 1 reverses the modulation by MgATP. Thus, there may be an endogenous protein kinase activity firmly associated with this K+ channel. Some ion channels may exist in a complex that contains regulatory protein kinases and phosphatases."
https://openalex.org/W1498146886,"Zinc finger genes encode metal-binding proteins that can act as transcriptional regulators of other genes. In an effort to identify activators of the genetic cascade in hemopoietic differentiation, we used degenerate synthetic oligonucleotides to the conserved zinc finger histidine-cysteine link to probe a human myeloid lambda gt11 cDNA library. One of the cDNA clones obtained hybridized preferentially to mRNA from myeloid cells. This cDNA was used to isolate clones encompassing the coding region for this gene. Sequence analysis found 13 zinc finger regions and a glycine-proline-rich region between the fourth and fifth zinc finger domain. The gene was localized to chromosome 19q13.2-4, a chromosome that has a large cluster of zinc finger genes. The gene was preferentially expressed in myeloid leukemia cell lines with the highest mRNA levels noted in HL-60 cells induced to differentiate with retinoic acid. Thus, this new zinc finger gene (designated MZF-1) may be one regulator of transcriptional events during hemopoietic development."
https://openalex.org/W1592701645,"Digitonin can be used to permeabilize selectively the plasma membrane of Trypanosoma cruzi epimastigotes without significantly affecting the functional integrity of mitochondria. Addition of digitonin at concentrations close to 64 microM caused decrease in the rate of basal respiration of epimastigotes similar to that caused by oligomycin. A further addition of carbonyl cyanide p-trifluorophenylhydrazone (FCCP) brought respiration to the same rate observed prior to the inclusion of digitonin or oligomycin. This suggests that like oligomycin, digitonin is shifting respiration to a nonphosphorylating state probably by depleting the cells from adenine nucleotides due to permeabilization of the plasma membrane. The use of low concentrations of digitonin allowed the quantitative determination of the mitochondrial membrane potential of these cells in situ using safranine O. The response of epimastigotes mitochondrial membrane potential to phosphate, FCCP, valinomycin, nigericin, ADP, and Ca2+ indicates that these mitochondria behave similarly to vertebrate mitochondria regarding the properties of their electrochemical proton gradient. In addition, T. cruzi mitochondria are able to build up and retain a membrane potential of a value comparable to that of mammalian mitochondria. The trypanocidal drug crystal violet, as well as other cationic drugs such as dequalinium, induced a rapid dose-related collapse of the inner mitochondrial membrane potential."
https://openalex.org/W1974997269,Mammalian 3T3-L1 cells differentiate into adipocytes after continuous exposure to pharmacological doses of insulin or physiological doses of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-1). Expression of transfected ras oncogenes led to differentiation of these cells into adipocytes in the absence of externally added insulin or IGF-I. Cells transfected with normal ras genes or the tyrosine kinase trk oncogene did not differentiate. Transfection with a dominant inhibitory ras mutant resulted in inhibition of differentiation. Exposure of untransfected 3T3-L1 cells to insulin stimulated formation of the active Ras⋅GTP complex. These observations indicate that Ras proteins participate in signal transduction pathways initiated by insulin and IGF-I in these cells.
https://openalex.org/W1514209943,"Statistical analysis of an expanded data base of regions in viral polyproteins and in non-viral proteins that are sensitive to hydrolysis by the protease from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 has generated a model which characterizes the substrate specificity of this retroviral enzyme. The model leads to an algorithm for predicting protease-susceptible sites from primary structure. Amino acids in each of the sites from P4 to P4' are tabulated for 40 protein substrates, and the frequency of occurrence for each residue is compared to the natural abundance of that amino acid in a selected data set of globular proteins. The results suggest that the highest stringency for particular amino acid residues is at the P2, P1, and P2' positions of the substrate. The broad specificity of the HIV-1 protease appears to be a consequence of its being able to bind productively substrates in which interactions with only a few Pi or Pi' side-chains need be optimized. The analysis, extended to 22 protein segments cleaved by the HIV-2 protease, delineates marked differences in specificity from that of the HIV-1 enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1594139320,"Retroviruses encode a protease which cleaves the viral Gag and Gag/Pol protein precursors into mature products. To understand the target sequence specificity of the viral protease, the amino acid sequences from 46 known processing sites from 10 diverse retroviruses were compared. Sequence preference was evident in positions P4 through P3' when compared to flanking sequences. Approximately 80% of all cleavage site sequences could be grouped into two classes based on the sequence composition flanking the scissile bond. The sequences at the amino-terminal cleavage site of the major capsid protein of Gag is always a member of one of the two classes while the carboxyl-terminal cleavage site is of the other class, suggesting a biological role for the two classes. Known processing site sequences proved useful in a motif searching strategy to identify processing sites in retroviral protein sequences, particularly in Gag. In all known cleavage sites, the P1 amino acid is hydrophobic and unbranched at the beta-carbon. The sequence requirements of the P1 position were tested by site-directed mutagenesis of the P1 Phe codon in an HIV-1 Pol cleavage site. Mutations were tested for protease-mediated cleavage of the Pol precursor expressed in Escherichia coli."
https://openalex.org/W1632363668,"The rate of uptake of oxidized low density lipoprotein (LDL) by mouse peritoneal macrophages is similar to that of acetyl LDL; but only approximately 50% of the internalized oxidized LDL is ultimately degraded, in contrast to the near-complete degradation seen with acetyl LDL. The objectives of this study were to determine if this was due to increased surface binding of oxidized LDL, different uptake pathways for oxidized LDL and acetyl LDL, lysosomal dysfunction caused by oxidized LDL, or resistance of oxidized LDL to hydrolysis by lysosomal proteinases. LDL binding studies at 4 degrees C showed that the increased cell association with oxidized LDL could not be explained by differences in cell-surface binding. Immunofluorescence microscopy confirmed intracellular accumulation of apoB-immunoreactive material in macrophages incubated with oxidized LDL, but not with acetyl LDL. The scavenger receptor ligand polyinosinic acid inhibited both the cell association and degradation of oxidized LDL in macrophages by greater than 75%, suggesting a common uptake pathway for degraded LDL and nondegraded LDL. Studies in THP-1 cells also did not reveal more than one specific uptake pathway for oxidized LDL. LDL derivatized by incubation with oxidized arachidonic acid (under conditions that prevented oxidation of the LDL itself) showed inefficient degradation, similar to oxidized LDL. When macrophages were incubated with oxidized LDL together with acetyl 125I-LDL, the acetyl LDL was degraded normally, excluding lysosomal dysfunction as the explanation for the accumulation of oxidized LDL. Generation of trichloroacetic acid-soluble products from oxidized 125I-LDL by exposure to cathepsins B and D was less than that observed with native 125I-LDL. LDL modified by exposure to reactive products derived from oxidized arachidonic acid was also degraded more slowly than native 125I-LDL by cathepsins. In contrast, acetyl 125I-LDL was degraded more rapidly by cathepsins than native 125I-LDL, and aggregated LDL and malondialdehyde-modified LDL were degraded at the same rate as native 125I-LDL. It is concluded that the intracellular accumulation of oxidized LDL in macrophages can be explained at least in part by the resistance of oxidatively modified apolipoprotein B to cathepsins. This resistance to cathepsins does not appear to be due to aggregation of oxidized LDL, but may be a consequence of modification of apolipoprotein B by lipid peroxidation products."
https://openalex.org/W2051745417,"Alzheimer's disease is characterized by widespread deposition of amyloid in the central nervous system. The 4-kilodalton amyloid beta protein is derived from a larger amyloid precursor protein and forms amyloid deposits in the brain by an unknown pathological mechanism. Except for aged nonhuman primates, there is no animal model for Alzheimer's disease. Transgenic mice expressing amyloid beta protein in the brain could provide such a model. To investigate this possibility, the 4-kilodalton human amyloid beta protein was expressed under the control of the promoter of the human amyloid precursor protein in two lines of transgenic mice. Amyloid beta protein accumulated in the dendrites of some but not all hippocampal neurons in 1-year-old transgenic mice. Aggregates of the amyloid beta protein formed amyloid-like fibrils that are similar in appearance to those in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease."
https://openalex.org/W1674260863,"At physiological glucose concentrations, isolated pancreatic islets release a minor portion of their newly synthesized insulin and precursors in a phase of secretion which is largely complete by 4 h of chase. Discharge during this period can be amplified by secretagogues, yet is not abolished by conditions which fully suppress regulated release from dense core secretory granules. The ability to stimulate the secretion and the biochemical profile of released proinsulin-related peptides indicate that secretion during this period originates from immature granules. The stoichiometry of release of labeled C-peptide:insulin during this phase is 1:1 at high glucose concentrations. However, at physiologic or low concentrations, C-peptide is released in molar excess of insulin as if the exocytotic vesicles carrying this secretion were budding from a post-Golgi compartment in which the lumen was composed of condensing insulin and soluble C-peptide. These findings can be explained by a model for regulated secretory protein traffic in which direct exocytosis of young granules is stimulated by higher glucose concentrations and vesicle budding from immature granules occurs at lower concentrations. Thus, insulin targeting from immature granules exhibits both regulated and constitutive-like characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W1543315777,"Biglycan (PG-I, DS-PG-1, PG-S1) is a small cellular or pericellular matrix proteoglycan that is closely related in structure to two other small proteoglycans, decorin (PG-II, PG-S2, DS-PG2, or PG-40) and fibromodulin. The core protein is made up predominantly of a series of 11 tandem repeats that appear to have been used throughout evolution for protein-protein, protein-cell, or cell-cell interactions. The function of biglycan is unclear at this time, but it has been shown to bind transforming growth factor beta in vitro. We have cloned and partially sequenced the approximately 8-kilobase pair human biglycan gene. The gene consists of eight exons including one in the sequence that encodes the 5'-untranslated region of the mRNA. The first and seventh introns are approximately 1 kilobase pair, while the remainder are shorter. With the exception of the first two introns, all of the introns are spread throughout the hydrophobic repeat domain. The 500-base pair 5' to the start of transcription contains several elements that strongly suggest that it contains a significant amount of the gene promoter. The elements include one AP2 and five SP1 consensus sequences. Like in many other genes, the biglycan gene promoter lacks both a CAAT and TATA box but is rich in GC content. Using 3H-labeled cDNA and in situ hybridization and autoradiography of human chromosomes, the human gene was localized to the end of the long arm of the X chromosome (Xq27-ter). The relationship of biglycan to a number of other proteins containing the leucine-rich repeats is discussed with respect to homologies of cysteine regions immediately adjacent to the repeat sequences."
https://openalex.org/W1569457616,"We report here that rabbit myocardial cytosolic calcium-independent phospholipase A2 exists as a high molecular weight complex comprised of catalytic and regulatory polypeptides whose activity and stability are influenced by specific interactions with ATP. Multiple lines of evidence document the functional significance of interactions between the catalytic complex and ATP including: 1) adenine nucleotide triphosphates attenuate the rate of thermal denaturation of native cytosolic phospholipase A2; 2) ATP augments the initial rate of phospholipid hydrolysis in a manner independent of the concentration, interfacial properties, and physical state of aggregated substrate; 3) adenine nucleotide triphosphates attenuate the reactivity of an essential thiol residue to covalent modification by 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid); and 4) the catalytic complex specifically and reversibly binds to ATP affinity matrices, although the purified 40-kDa catalytic subunit neither binds to ATP affinity matrices nor is subject to ATP-dependent activation and stabilization. The catalytic and regulatory elements were functionally resolved by differential thermal inactivation and the ATP-regulatable phospholipase A2 catalytic complex was reassembled by reconstitution of highly purified catalytic and partially purified regulatory proteins. Thus, alterations in ATP concentration influence the activity and longevity of the myocardial cytosolic calcium-independent phospholipase A2 catalytic complex, thereby potentially modulating the release of lipidic second messengers and facilitating adaptive alterations in membrane physical properties."
https://openalex.org/W1605005139,"The expression of a major cellular substrate for protein kinase C, the MARCKS protein, is regulated in a cell-, tissue-, and developmental stage-specific fashion; in addition, this expression can be stimulated acutely by various cytokines in certain cell types. We have begun to characterize the human gene in order to elucidate the genetic elements responsible for this highly regulated expression. We first cloned a human MARCKS cDNA, which encoded a predicted protein of 332 amino acids (Mr 31,600) that was approximately 89, 74, and 59% identical to the bovine, mouse, and chicken proteins, respectively. Regions conserved at the amino acid level included the amino-terminal myristoylation consensus sequence, the site of intron splicing, and the phosphorylation site domain. The human cDNA was used to demonstrate that tumor necrosis factor-alpha could rapidly stimulate MARCKS gene transcription in the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL60. Genomic clones were then isolated; sequence analysis identified a putative promoter region that had no TATA box and contained multiple transcription initiation sites in a region spanning 57 base pairs (bp). This was followed by a 5'-untranslated region of approximately 400 bp, which displayed a complex predicted secondary structure with a delta G of -73.4 kcal/mol. Plasmid constructions containing between 52 and 1453 bp of the human MARCKS promoter linked to the human growth hormone gene were then used in transient expression experiments. Constructions containing 52 and 110 bp of the MARCKS promoter did not exhibit promoter function while the larger constructions all exhibited promotor function; the 248-bp fragment of the MARCKS promoter was 80% as effective as the human ferritin promoter in stimulating expression of human growth hormone in intact cells. Using an insert from the human genomic clone as a probe, we identified human chromosome 6, q21-qter, as the location of the MARCKS gene; this has been assigned the gene symbol MACS."
https://openalex.org/W1679612822,"The rpoB8 allele of Escherichia coli maps to the beta-subunit of RNA polymerase and confers rifampicin resistance as well as increased termination at both intrinsic and rho-dependent terminators in vivo. This phenotype suggests that the mutant is defective in an enzymatic property of RNA polymerase important for all termination events. We analyzed the in vitro transcription properties of this enzyme to determine the nature of the defect. As compared with the wild-type enzyme, RpoB8 exhibits enhanced pausing and a significant reduction in rate of elongation on natural templates. In addition, RpoB8 RNA polymerase has a 3-5-fold higher Km for purine nucleotides during elongation on synthetic templates. In contrast, both the mutant and wild-type enzyme have the same initiation Km for ATP. Kinetic analysis indicates that RpoB8 is likely to be defective in nucleotide binding during elongation, suggesting that the mutational alteration affects the binding site. We show that our data are consistent with the idea that the altered Km underlies the altered pausing and elongation properties of the enzyme, and we discuss the implication of these results for the termination proficiency of the mutant strain."
https://openalex.org/W1507853028,"The P1 ParB protein is required for active partition and thus stable inheritance of the plasmid prophage. ParB and the Escherichia coli protein integration host factor (IHF) participate in the assembly of a partition complex at the centromere-like site parS. In this report the role of IHF in the formation of the partition complex has been explored. First, ParB protein was purified for these studies, which revealed that ParB forms a dimer in solution. Next, the IHF binding site was mapped to a 29-base pair region within parS, including the sequence TAACTGACTGTTT (which differs from the IHF consensus in two positions). IHF induced a strong bend in the DNA at its binding site. Versions of parS which have lost or damaged the IHF binding site bound ParB with greatly reduced affinity in vitro and in vivo. Measurements of binding constants showed that IHF increased ParB affinity for the wild-type parS site by about 10,000-fold. Finally, DNA supercoiling improved ParB binding in the presence of IHF but not in its absence. These observations led to the proposal that IHF and superhelicity assist ParB by promoting its precise positioning at parS, a spatial arrangement that results in a high affinity of ParB for parS."
https://openalex.org/W1487125516,"We report on the interactions of urea and guanidinium salts with streptavidin. Gel filtration chromatography in 0, 4, 6, and 7 M urea indicates that the streptavidin tetramer remains intact in urea. Biotin alters the electrophoretic mobility of streptavidin whether or not 6 M urea is present. The intrinsic fluorescence of streptavidin is increased and blue-shifted in 6 M urea. The fluorescence changes indicate the absence of unfolding. A conformational response to urea is possible, but much of the fluorescence change is due to urea binding as a weak biotin analog (Ka approximately 1.3 M-1). The resistance to structural perturbation by urea reflects the structural stability of streptavidin's anti-parallel beta-barrel motif. Unfolding is sluggish in 6 M guanidinium hydrochloride (half-time, approximately 50 days). After guanidinium thiocyanate unfolding, streptavidin can be refolded, but the unfolding and refolding transitions are centered at different concentrations of perturbant. Slow unfolding, with a 15th power dependence on guanidinium thiocyanate concentration, may be partially responsible for the noncoincidence of the unfolding and refolding processes. Nonequilibrium behavior is also seen in 6 M urea, as native streptavidin does not unfold and guanidinium thiocyanate unfolded streptavidin does not refold. Refolding does occur at lower concentrations of urea. Guanidinium thiocyanate only slowly unfolds the biotin-streptavidin complex. In the presence of biotin, unfolded streptavidin does not refold in 6 M guanidinium thiocyanate or in 6 M urea."
https://openalex.org/W1585311371,"Mammalian tissues contain protein carboxyl methyltransferases that catalyze the transfer of methyl groups from S-adenosylmethionine to the free carboxyl groups of D-aspartyl or L-isoaspartyl residues (EC 2.1.1.77). These enzymes have been postulated to play a role in the repair and/or degradation of spontaneously damaged proteins. We have now characterized a similar activity from Escherichia coli that recognizes L-isoaspartyl-containing peptides as well as protein substrates such as ovalbumin. The enzyme was purified by DEAE-cellulose, hydroxylapatite, Sephadex G-100, polyaspartate, and reversed-phase chromatography and was shown to consist of a single 24-kDa polypeptide chain. The sequence determined for the N-terminal 39 residues was used to design an oligonucleotide probe that allowed the precise localization of its structural gene (pcm) on the physical map of the E. coli chromosome at 59 min. Transformation of E. coli cells with a plasmid containing DNA from this region results in a 3-4-fold overproduction of enzyme activity. The nucleotide sequence determined for the pcm gene and its flanking regions was used to deduce a mature amino acid sequence of 207 residues with a calculated molecular weight of 23,128. This sequence shows 30.8% sequence identity with the human L-isoaspartyl/D-aspartyl methyltransferase and suggests that this enzyme catalyzes a fundamental reaction in both procaryotic and eucaryotic cells."
https://openalex.org/W1514708207,TAPA-1 (the target of an antiproliferative antibody) is a 26-kDa cell surface protein expressed on most human cell lines. TAPA-1 is a member of an evolutionarily related family of cell surface proteins all of which contain four transmembrane domains. A model is proposed for topology of TAPA-1 based on proteolysis studies in the in vitro translated protein embedded into microsomal membranes. This analysis predicts that the amino and the carboxyl termini of the molecule are cytoplasmic and that the two hydrophilic regions of the molecule are extracellular. The antigenic epitope of the human TAPA-1 is contained within a subregion of the second extracellular domain of the protein. This is the only region in the protein that has not been tightly conserved in mammalian evolution.
https://openalex.org/W1522996075,"Oxidative damage to proteins is known to occur via conversion of side chain amino groups to corresponding carbonyl derivatives. Such damage to enzymes and purified proteins has been quantified previously by reduction with sodium boro[3H]hydride and subsequent measurement of the incorporation of 3H into amino acid fractions. In this study, the NaB3H4 reduction assay was modified to permit the quantitation of free radical-mediated oxidative damage to proteins obtained from animals. Modifications included additional extractions of protein isolates with organic solvents to remove lipids and with nitric acid to remove metal ions. The modified assay has first been validated in vitro by measuring changes in levels of oxidative damage to bovine serum albumin exposed to xanthine plus xanthine oxidase (2-fold increase), to hydrogen peroxide and iron(II) sulfate (5-fold increase), or to gamma radiation (30-fold increase over controls, respectively). gamma radiation of isolated hamster kidney protein also raised the carbonyl content in a dose-dependent manner. The modified assay has then been validated in vivo by measuring the changes in oxidative damage to lung tissue in animals exposed to approximately 85% oxygen (2-fold increase) or to different doses of paraquat (5-fold increase with the high dose over controls, respectively). The assay was then used to examine free radical-mediated oxidation introduced by acute or chronic treatment of hamsters with estrogens, since both synthetic and natural estrogens induce kidney tumors in this species. Priming of hamsters for 3 days with 20 mg/kg/day diethylstilbestrol and treatment with 100 mg/kg of this drug on the 4th day resulted in a 160% increase in free radical modification of renal proteins. Oxidative damage to kidney proteins was also assayed in hamsters treated with estradiol implants for up to 7 months, a regimen known to induce kidney tumors. Significant increases in covalent oxidative modification to renal proteins over values in age-matched controls were detected after 1, 2, and 7 months of continuous estradiol exposure. It is concluded that the modification of the NaB3H4 reduction assay is a useful postlabeling method for monitoring free radical action in vivo. Furthermore, it is postulated that free radical damage in estrogen-treated hamster kidney plays a role in estrogen-induced carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1559223957,"A monoclonal antibody was raised against a mineralized tissue-specific sialoprotein containing no phosphorus using partially purified noncollagenous bone matrix proteins from rats as antigen. Then the sialoprotein was purified by high performance liquid chromatography from rat mandibulae using the monoclonal antibody as a marker. The sialoprotein (59-kDa bone sialoprotein (BSP)) with a molecular weight of 59,000 contained 1.4% sialic acid but no detectable phosphorus. Immunohistochemical studies with the antibody showed that the protein was specific to mineralized tissues such as bone and dentin, and present in osteoblasts, osteocytes, and bone matrix. No other soft tissues, such as the cartilage, liver, kidney, and periosteum, were stained. However, Western blot analysis showed that plasma contained immunoreactive 59-kDa BSP. The quantitative amino acid composition of 59-kDa BSP resembled that of human alpha 2-HS glycoprotein (alpha 2-HSG) (Lee, C.-C., Bowman, B.H., and Yang, F. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 84, 4403-4407; Kellermann, J., Haupt, H., Auerswald, E.-A., and Muller-Esterl, W. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 14121-14128) and rat 64-kDa protein (Franzen, A., and Heinegard, D. (1985) in The Chemistry and Biology of Mineralized Tissues (Butler, W.T., ed), p. 132, EBSCO Media, Birmingham, AL). Amino acid sequence analyses of the amino-terminal region and four peptide fragments of 59-kDa BSP revealed that about 50% of the amino acids were homologous with those of human alpha 2-HSG, which is known to be synthesized by the liver, transported in the bloodstream, and incorporated into calcified tissues. But when newborn rat calvaria, primary cultures of osteoblast-rich cells, and adult rat hepatocytes were incubated with radioactive leucine, immunoreactive 59-kDa BSP was detected in their conditioned medium by fluorography. Several characteristics, including the amino acid sequence, suggest that 59-kDa BSP may be the rat counterpart of human alpha 2-HSG. However, rat 59-kDa BSP is a single peptide and synthesized by both osteoblasts and hepatocytes, whereas human alpha 2-HSG is known to be a heterodimer and to be synthesized by the liver."
https://openalex.org/W1557366448,"Expression in a recombinant system has been difficult to obtain for any of the major fibrillar collagens that require processing by eight or more post-translational enzymes. Here, two DNA constructs were designed so that the promoter region of the gene for the pro-alpha 1(I) chain of human type I procollagen drove expression of the human type II procollagen gene in mouse NIH 3T3 cells, a culture line that normally synthesizes type I procollagen but not any cartilage-specific protein such as type II procollagen. Both constructs were expressed as both mRNA and protein. In clones expressing the construct at high levels, the steady-state levels of mRNA and the production of type II procollagen were comparable to the mRNA levels and production of type I procollagen from the endogenous mouse genes. Comparison of clones containing the two constructs demonstrated that sequences extending 80 base pairs beyond the major polyadenylation signal of the gene are not in themselves sufficient for correct termination and 3' processing of RNA transcripts. The results strongly suggest that specific sequences present in a downstream 3.5-kilobase SphI/SphI fragment determine the termination of the transcription. Of special importance is that the system will make it possible to examine the consequences of mutations in the human type II procollagen gene on the processing of RNA transcripts and on the functional properties of the protein simply by using the genomic DNA from leukocytes or other non-cartilaginous sources."
https://openalex.org/W1543527151,"The channel-forming protein aerolysin must cross both the inner and outer bacterial membranes during its secretion from Aeromonas hydrophila or from Aeromonas salmonicida containing the cloned structural gene. We examined the fate of three mutant proteins in which Trp-227, near the middle of the amino acid chain, was replaced with glycine, leucine, or phenylalanine by site-directed mutagenesis. All three proteins crossed the inner membrane and entered the periplasm in the same way as wild-type, and in each case the signal sequence was removed correctly. Little or none of the proaerolysin substituted with glycine or leucine was released into the culture supernatant. Instead, significant amounts became associated with the outer membrane. The Phe-227 protoxin was secreted by the bacteria but at a reduced rate. The leucine and phenylalanine mutant proteins were purified and compared with native proaerolysin. They were processed correctly to the mature forms by treatment with trypsin, and like native aerolysin, both were resistant to further proteolysis. In each case, processing was followed by the formation of oligomers similar to those produced by native toxin. The hemolytic activity of the processed Phe-227 mutant was one-quarter that of wild-type toxin whereas Leu-227 aerolysin had less than one-hundredth the wild-type activity. These results are further evidence that aerolysin is secreted in at least two steps. As well, they show that the last step, crossing the outer membrane, can be blocked by an apparently small change in the structure of the protein."
https://openalex.org/W1577423003,"Abstract We have examined the comparative membrane interaction properties of synthetic peptides corresponding to the wild-type and an export-defective, mutated signal sequence from the Escherichia coli outer membrane protein, OmpA. As part of a collaborative study of the effects of various alterations on the function of the OmpA signal sequence and the biophysical properties of the corresponding synthetic peptides, we incorporated the small, neutral polar residue, asparagine, into the hydrophobic core in place of Ile-8. This seemingly minor perturbation to the signal sequence caused a complete block of export in vivo (J. Goldstein, S. Lehnhardt, and M. Inouye, following paper). We now explore in detail the difference in the properties of the wild-type and the Ile-8----Asn OmpA signal peptides. The fluorescent residue Trp was substituted in both peptides in place of the wild-type Phe at position 15. This mutation is silent phenotypically and provides a superb probe of membrane interaction. We find that the Asn substitution leaves the conformational properties of the signal sequence essentially unchanged, but prevents any significant interaction of the peptide with a lipid bilayer. Asparagines are very underrepresented among known signal sequences. We believe this low frequency to be due to the lowering of mean residue hydrophobicity caused by incorporation of Asn and the consequent reduced ability to bind and insert into membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1504555965,"Synthetic peptides were used to probe the structure-function relationships between human choriotropin (hCG) and the lutropin (LH) receptor. Previously, a peptide region of the alpha subunit of hCG, residues 26-46, had been shown to inhibit binding of 125I-hCG to the LH receptor in rat ovarian membranes (Charlesworth, M.C., McCormick, D.J., Madden, B., and Ryan, R.J. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 13409-13416). To determine which residues are important for this inhibitory activity, peptides were truncated from either the amino or carboxyl terminus, or individual residues were substituted with alanine. The amino-terminal boundary was determined to be Gly-30 and the carboxyl-terminal boundary, Lys-44. This core peptide contained all the residues needed for full activity of the parent peptide 26-46. Arg-35 and Phe-33 were particularly important residues; when they were substituted with alanine, the peptide inhibitory potencies were decreased. Ser-43, Arg-42, Cys-32, and Cys-31 were also important but to a lesser degree. These results are consistent with predictions based on chemical and enzymatic modification studies and provide insight into which residues are important for interaction between hCG and the LH receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1581603899,"An anionic amphiphilic peptide and the charge-reversed cationic peptide are synthesized. They contain 20 amino acids with the same sequence except for 5 Glu residues for the anionic versus 5 Lys residues for the cationic peptides. Fusion of egg phosphatidylcholine large unilamellar vesicles is assayed with the fluorescent probes by the lipid mixing and the internal content mixing at neutral pH. The peptide mixture causes a rapid and efficient membrane fusion, in spite of no fusions with each peptide by itself. Each peptide takes nearly random coils with a small amount of helix, but the peptide mixture has an ordered helical structure. The equimolar peptide mixture forms a much more hydrophobic complex than those of different molar ratios of peptides and also that of each peptide itself. The equimolar peptide mixture causes the most efficient fusion. Preincubations of two peptides before addition to vesicles cause the slower rates of fusion. The fusion is greatly reduced at higher ionic strength and nearly zero at 800 mM NaCl and 40 mM sodium phosphate. Each peptide and the peptide mixture show the same alpha-helical structure, interact with vesicles, but do not induce fusion at higher ionic strengths. These results suggest that the two peptides interact mutually through the electrostatic Coulombic interaction between the charged groups. The electrically neutralized hydrophobic complex aggregates the separate vesicles together and interacts with the hydrocarbon region of lipid bilayers to cause fusion."
https://openalex.org/W1504424360,"Colonic growth factors (CGFs) were extracted from porcine intestinal epithelium and mucosa. Under acidic conditions, very little mitogenic activity (as assayed using murine 3T3 fibroblasts and a human colonic cell line) was extractable. However, by extracting at neutral or slightly alkaline pH, significant mitogenic activity for both the murine fibroblasts and human colonic carcinoma cell line could be detected. CGFs are present throughout the intestine and cecum. The epithelial mucosa of the distal colorectal region appeared to contain mitogens which were more potent for the colonic cells than the 3T3 fibroblasts. Purification of CGFs from the colonic mucosa required removal of associated mucin by pH precipitation prior to chromatographic fractionation. It was then possible to develop a complete purification (390,000-fold) scheme for the major CGF, an 18-kDa protein which bound to heparin-Sepharose. N-terminal sequence analysis yielded a single sequence (Q)SPGGAMAAGSITTLPALP, i.e. an N-terminally extended form of basic fibroblast growth factor. Apart from the substitution of Gly in bovine basic fibroblast growth factor by a Ser in porcine CGF, the proteins are identical. A similar extraction procedure using purified human colonic crypt epithelial cells yielded a mitogen for the human colonic cell line with similar chromatographic properties."

https://openalex.org/W1615996173,"Abstract On the basis of the biophysical studies on the synthetic mutant (Ile-8----Asn) OmpA signal peptide in the preceding paper (Hoyt, D. C., and Gierasch, L.M. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 14406-14412), the in vivo effects of the same mutation were examined by fusing the mutant OmpA signal sequence to Staphylococcus aureus nuclease or TEM beta-lactamase. The mutation in which the isoleucine residue at position 8 of the OmpA signal sequence of Escherichia coli was replaced with a neutral polar residue, asparagine, resulted in a defective signal peptide. The mutant signal sequence was unable to be processed, and the precursor molecule accumulated in the cytoplasmic as well as in the membrane fractions, indicating that the Ile-8----Asn OmpA signal sequence is not competent for translocating nuclease A or beta-lactamase across the membrane. This result is consistent with the in vitro studies on the Ile-8----Asn OmpA signal peptide, which indicated that the mutant signal peptide was unable to penetrate into the hydrophobic core of the lipid bilayer. Other asparagine or glutamine substitution mutations in the hydrophobic region of the OmpA signal sequence were also examined. Interestingly, the OmpA signal sequence with either Ile-8----Gln, Val-10----Asn, or Leu-12----Asn mutation was completely defective as the Ile-8----Asn OmpA signal sequence, while the Ile-6----Asn and Ala-9----Asn OmpA nucleases were able to be processed to secrete nuclease, although the processing occurred at a much slower rate than the wild-type OmpA nuclease. These results indicate that the defects depend on the position of the lesion in the hydrophobic core of the OmpA signal sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1518781107,"Abstract A peptide mitogen bombesin, which activates the phospholipase C-protein kinase C signaling pathway, induces a mepacrine-sensitive, dose-dependent increase in the release of [3H]arachidonic acid and its metabolites ([3H]AA) from prelabeled Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts. The effect is temporally composed of two phases, i.e. an initial transient burst that is essentially independent of extracellular Ca2+, and a following sustained phase that is absolutely dependent on the extracellular Ca2+. The initial transient [3H]AA liberation occurs concomitantly with bombesin-induced 45Ca efflux from prelabeled cells: both responses being substantially attenuated by loading cells with a Ca2+ chelator quin2. However, bombesin-induced intracellular Ca2+ mobilization by itself is not sufficient as a signal for the initial transient [3H]AA liberation, since A23187 potently stimulates 45Ca efflux to an extent comparable to bombesin but fails to induce [3H]AA release in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. The second sustained phase of the bombesin-induced [3H]AA release is abolished by reducing extracellular Ca2+ to 0.03 mM, although bombesin effects on phospholipase C and protein kinase C activation are barely affected by the same procedure. A protein kinase C activator phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate induces an extracellular Ca(2+)-dependent, slowly developing sustained increase in [3H]AA release, and markedly potentiates both phases of bombesin-induced [3H]AA release. Down-regulation of cellular protein kinase C completely abolishes all of the effects of phorbol dibutyrate, and partially inhibits the second but not the first phase of bombesin-induced [3H]AA release. These results indicate that bombesin-induced receptor-mediated activation of phospholipase A2 involves multiple mechanisms, including intracellular Ca2+ mobilization for the first phase, protein kinase C activation plus Ca2+ influx for the second phase, and as yet unknown mechanism(s) independent of intracellular Ca2+ mobilization or protein kinase C for both of the phases."
https://openalex.org/W1584839207,"The intrinsically active, sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase present in membranes prepared from both wild type Escherichia coli and from strains which overproduce the enzyme can be kinetically distinguished from a latent enzyme species which is unmasked by solubilization and reconstitution. Both membrane-associated and solubilized/reconstituted enzyme preparations exhibited cooperativity with respect to sn-glycerol-3-phosphate and palmitoyl-coenzyme A substrates; positive cooperativity in membranes toward palmitoyl-coenzyme A (napp = 4) and negative cooperativity toward sn-glycerol-3-phosphate (napp = 0.75) were significantly altered upon solubilization and reconstitution. Since the degree of alteration increased with the amount of sn-glycerol-3-P acyltransferase present in the membranes, a detergent-dissociable homooligomerization of the sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase was considered as an underlying mechanism. This possibility was investigated by changing the protein-to-Triton X-100 ratio of homogeneous enzyme prior to reconstitution and then analyzing the subsequent migration of samples on a Sephacryl S-300 sizing column. The elution positions were consistent with monomeric and dimeric polypeptide bound to micelles of Triton X-100. Hill coefficients for monomeric, reconstituted enzyme preparations were comparable to those obtained for the active, membrane-associated sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase. The reduced cooperativity of dimeric, reconstituted enzyme preparations correlated closely to the Hill coefficient values obtained for latent, solubilized/reconstituted sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase from membranes of Escherichia coli which overproduce the enzyme. The physiological significance of these findings is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1527928521,"Cytochrome aco purified from an alkalophilic bacterium grown at pH 10 contains hemes a, b, and c as prosthetic groups, and their redox behavior was examined by using stopped-flow and rapid-scan techniques. Under anaerobic conditions the reduction of both heme a and c moieties with dithionite proceeded exponentially but with different rates, usually the former being reduced about 4 times faster than the latter. The reduction of protoheme was much slower, and a time-difference spectrum for this species was of a high spin type with absorption peaks at 433, 557, and 609 nm. Only the protoheme combined with CO, fulfilling the criteria for cytochrome o. Potentiometric titrations determined a midpoint potential of c heme to be 95 mV at pH 7.0 and 25 degrees C and suggested the presence of two forms of a heme with midpoint potentials of 250 and 323 mV. Cytochrome aco utilizes ascorbate plus N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (TMPD) to reduce oxygen relatively rapidly without added cytochrome c (Qureshi, M. H., Yumoto, I., Fujiwara, T., Fukumori, Y., Yamanaka, T. (1990) J. Biochem. 107, 480-485). During the steady state, however, heme a stayed almost fully reduced in contrast to a partial reduction of heme c. Even after exhaustion of the dissolved oxygen the extent of reduction of heme c was 60-70% that attained by the dithionite reduction. When ascorbate plus TMPD-reduced cytochrome aco was exposed to oxygen the reduced heme c was oxidized rapidly whereas the oxidation of reduced a heme was negligibly slow. The full reduction of heme a during the steady state and its extremely slow oxidation rendered participation of heme a in the oxidase reaction less likely. A novel peak appearing transiently around 567 nm during the reaction was tentatively ascribed to an intermediate form of protoheme, or o heme, which was thus supposed to react directly with molecular oxygen. These results suggest strongly that the main electron transfer pathway would be c----o----oxygen. A possible role of a in regulating the electron flow through the main pathway and its functional relationship to a heme in the aa3-type cytochrome oxidase were discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1572109530,"The active site amino acid residues of lignin peroxidase are homologous to those of other peroxidases; however, in contrast to other peroxidases, no pH dependence is observed for the reaction of ferric lignin peroxidase with H2O2 to form compound I (Andrawis, A., Johnson, K.A., and Tien, M. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 1195-1198). Chloride binding is used in the present study to investigate this reaction further. Chloride binds to lignin peroxidase at the same site as cyanide and hydrogen peroxide. This is indicated by the following. 1) Chloride competes with cyanide in binding to lignin peroxidase. 2) Chloride is a competitive inhibitor of lignin peroxidase with respect to H2O2. The inhibition constant (Ki) is equal to the dissociation constant (Kd) of chloride at all pH values studied. Chloride binding is pH dependent: chloride binds only to the protonated form of lignin peroxidase. Transient-state kinetic studies demonstrate that chloride inhibits lignin peroxidase compound I formation in a pH-dependent manner with maximum inhibition at low pH. An apparent pKa was calculated at each chloride concentration; the pKa increased as the chloride concentration increased. Extrapolation to zero chloride concentration allowed us to estimate the intrinsic pKa for the ionization in the lignin peroxidase active site. The results reported here provide evidence that an acidic ionizable group (pKa approximately 1) at the active site controls both lignin peroxidase compound I formation and chloride binding. We propose that the mechanism for lignin peroxidase compound I formation is similar to that of other peroxidases in that it requires the deprotonated form of an ionizable group near the active site."

B., and Gautvik, K. M. (1990) Gene (Amst.) 90, 255-262). In the latter system, one major site of cleavage was identified (Arg25-Lys26 decreased Lys27). To produce hPTH resistant to this proteolytic processing, a point mutation changing Lys26 to Gln was introduced, and the modified gene expressed in S. cerevisiae as a fusion protein with the alpha-factor leader sequence. The resulting major form of hPTH secreted to the growth medium was of full length showing that the mutation had eliminated internal processing. Consequently, the yield of the mutant hormone was significantly higher than obtained with the natural peptide. Using improved purification procedures, a significantly higher purity was also obtained. The secreted mutant hPTH-(1-84,Q26) had the correct size, full immunological reactivity with two different hPTH antisera, correct amino acid composition and N-terminal sequence, and correct mass as determined by mass spectrometry. Furthermore, the introduced mutation did not reduce the biological activity of the hormone as judged from its action in three biological assay systems: 1) a hormone-sensitive osteoblast adenylate cyclase assay; 2) an in vivo calcium mobilizing assay in rats; and 3) an in vitro bone resorption assay."
https://openalex.org/W1660786530,"A 48-kDa protein from the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is antigenically and structurally similar to S-antigen from retina. Eight anti-S-antigen monoclonal antibodies, directed against distinct epitopes, cross-reacted with a yeast 48-kDa protein. Structural similarity between the bovine and yeast proteins was further demonstrated by comparison of tryptic peptide fragments containing one of these epitopes. This 48-kDa yeast protein appears to be a component of the replicative complex of the cell. It was found associated with immunoaffinity-purified yeast DNA polymerase I-primase and with yeast DNA-replicative complex. The 48-kDa protein was phosphorylated by a protein kinase activity endogenous to the replicative complex preparation. This phosphorylation was dependent on the cell division cycle gene CDC7. In addition, authentic bovine S-antigen, when added to yeast DNA polymerase I-primase, stimulated polymerase activity. These findings suggest that the yeast S-antigen-like protein may play a role in replication, and they raise the possibility that it may be involved in traversal of the G1/S boundary of the cell cycle."
