https://openalex.org/W1987416224,"Boron-doped silicon nanowires (SiNWs) were used to create highly sensitive, real-time electrically based sensors for biological and chemical species. Amine- and oxide-functionalized SiNWs exhibit pH-dependent conductance that was linear over a large dynamic range and could be understood in terms of the change in surface charge during protonation and deprotonation. Biotin-modified SiNWs were used to detect streptavidin down to at least a picomolar concentration range. In addition, antigen-functionalized SiNWs show reversible antibody binding and concentration-dependent detection in real time. Lastly, detection of the reversible binding of the metabolic indicator Ca 2+ was demonstrated. The small size and capability of these semiconductor nanowires for sensitive, label-free, real-time detection of a wide range of chemical and biological species could be exploited in array-based screening and in vivo diagnostics."
https://openalex.org/W2124757012,"Titanium and iron concentration data from the anoxic Cariaco Basin, off the Venezuelan coast, can be used to infer variations in the hydrological cycle over northern South America during the past 14,000 years with subdecadal resolution. Following a dry Younger Dryas, a period of increased precipitation and riverine discharge occurred during the Holocene ""thermal maximum."" Since approximately 5400 years ago, a trend toward drier conditions is evident from the data, with high-amplitude fluctuations and precipitation minima during the time interval 3800 to 2800 years ago and during the ""Little Ice Age."" These regional changes in precipitation are best explained by shifts in the mean latitude of the Atlantic Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), potentially driven by Pacific-based climate variability. The Cariaco Basin record exhibits strong correlations with climate records from distant regions, including the high-latitude Northern Hemisphere, providing evidence for global teleconnections among regional climates."
https://openalex.org/W2145625720,"The multivesicular body (MVB) pathway is responsible for both the biosynthetic delivery of lysosomal hydrolases and the downregulation of numerous activated cell surface receptors which are degraded in the lysosome. We demonstrate that ubiquitination serves as a signal for sorting into the MVB pathway. In addition, we characterize a 350 kDa complex, ESCRT-I (composed of Vps23, Vps28, and Vps37), that recognizes ubiquitinated MVB cargo and whose function is required for sorting into MVB vesicles. This recognition event depends on a conserved UBC-like domain in Vps23. We propose that ESCRT-I represents a conserved component of the endosomal sorting machinery that functions in both yeast and mammalian cells to couple ubiquitin modification to protein sorting and receptor downregulation in the MVB pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2037307064,"Plasma membrane wounds are repaired by a mechanism involving Ca(2+)-regulated exocytosis. Elevation in intracellular [Ca(2+)] triggers fusion of lysosomes with the plasma membrane, a process regulated by the lysosomal synaptotagmin isoform Syt VII. Here, we show that Ca(2+)-regulated exocytosis of lysosomes is required for the repair of plasma membrane disruptions. Lysosomal exocytosis and membrane resealing are inhibited by the recombinant Syt VII C(2)A domain or anti-Syt VII C(2)A antibodies, or by antibodies against the cytosolic domain of Lamp-1, which specifically aggregate lysosomes. We further demonstrate that lysosomal exocytosis mediates the resealing of primary skin fibroblasts wounded during the contraction of collagen matrices. These findings reveal a fundamental, novel role for lysosomes: as Ca(2+)-regulated exocytic compartments responsible for plasma membrane repair."
https://openalex.org/W2158424236,"The deployment of electronic data storage tags that are surgically implanted or satellite-linked provides marine researchers with new ways to examine the movements, environmental preferences, and physiology of pelagic vertebrates. We report the results obtained from tagging of Atlantic bluefin tuna with implantable archival and pop-up satellite archival tags. The electronic tagging data provide insights into the seasonal movements and environmental preferences of this species. Bluefin tuna dive to depths of >1000 meters and maintain a warm body temperature. Western-tagged bluefin tuna make trans-Atlantic migrations and they frequent spawning grounds in the Gulf of Mexico and eastern Mediterranean. These data are critical for the future management and conservation of bluefin tuna in the Atlantic."
https://openalex.org/W2097706279,"Vertebrate segmentation requires a molecular oscillator, the segmentation clock, acting in presomitic mesoderm (PSM) cells to set the pace at which segmental boundaries are laid down. However, the signals that position each boundary remain unclear. Here, we report that FGF8 which is expressed in the posterior PSM, generates a moving wavefront at which level both segment boundary position and axial identity become determined. Furthermore, by manipulating boundary position in the chick embryo, we show that Hox gene expression is maintained in the appropriately numbered somite rather than at an absolute axial position. These results implicate FGF8 in ensuring tight coordination of the segmentation process and spatiotemporal Hox gene activation."
https://openalex.org/W2093253527,"Using X-ray crystallography, we have directly observed the path of mRNA in the 70S ribosome in Fourier difference maps at 7 A resolution. About 30 nucleotides of the mRNA are wrapped in a groove that encircles the neck of the 30S subunit. The Shine-Dalgarno helix is bound in a large cleft between the head and the back of the platform. At the interface, only about eight nucleotides (-1 to +7), centered on the junction between the A and P codons, are exposed, and bond almost exclusively to 16S rRNA. The mRNA enters the ribosome around position +13 to +15, the location of downstream pseudoknots that stimulate -1 translational frame shifting."
https://openalex.org/W2144687501,"Cells degrade excess and effete organelles by the process of autophagy. Autophagic stimulation of rat hepatocytes by serum deprivation and glucagon (1 M) caused a fivefold increase of spontaneously depolarizing mitochondria to about 1.5% of total mitochondria after 90 min. Cyclosporin A (CsA, 5 M), an immunosuppressant that blocks the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT), prevented this depolarization. Depolarized mitochondria moved into acidic vacuoles labeled by LysoTracker Red. These autophagosomes also increased several-fold after autophagic stimulation. CsA blocked autophagosomal proliferation, whereas tacrolimus, an immunosuppressant that does not block the MPT, did not. In conclusion, the MPT initiates mitochondrial depolarization after autophagic stimulation and the subsequent sequestration of mitochondria into autophagosomes."
https://openalex.org/W2043676526,"Prions are self-propagating protein conformations. Recent research brought insight into prion propagation, but how they first appear is unknown. We previously established that the yeast non-Mendelian trait [PIN(+)] is required for the de novo appearance of the [PSI(+)] prion. Here, we show that the presence of prions formed by Rnq1 or Ure2 is sufficient to make cells [PIN(+)]. Thus, [PIN(+)] can be caused by more than one prion. Furthermore, an unbiased functional screen for [PIN(+)] prions uncovered the known prion gene, URE2, the proposed prion gene, NEW1, and nine novel candidate prion genes all carrying prion domains. Importantly, the de novo appearance of Rnq1::GFP prion aggregates also requires the presence of other prions, suggesting the existence of a general mechanism by which the appearance of prions is enhanced by heterologous prion aggregates."
https://openalex.org/W2034063871,"The homodimeric nickel-containing CO dehydrogenase from the anaerobic bacterium Carboxydothermus hydrogenoformans catalyzes the oxidation of CO to CO 2 . A crystal structure of the reduced enzyme has been solved at 1.6 angstrom resolution. This structure represents the prototype for Ni-containing CO dehydrogenases from anaerobic bacteria and archaea. It contains five metal clusters of which clusters B, B′, and a subunit-bridging, surface-exposed cluster D are cubane-type [4Fe-4S] clusters. The active-site clusters C and C′ are novel, asymmetric [Ni-4Fe-5S] clusters. Their integral Ni ion, which is the likely site of CO oxidation, is coordinated by four sulfur ligands with square planar geometry."
https://openalex.org/W2014089858,"Cell division depends on the separation of sister chromatids in anaphase. In yeast, sister separation is initiated by cleavage of cohesin by the protease separase. In vertebrates, most cohesin is removed from chromosome arms by a cleavage-independent mechanism. Only residual amounts of cohesin are cleaved at the onset of anaphase, coinciding with its disappearance from centromeres. We have identified two separase cleavage sites in the human cohesin subunit SCC1 and have conditionally expressed noncleavable SCC1 mutants in human cells. Our results indicate that cohesin cleavage by separase is essential for sister chromatid separation and for the completion of cytokinesis."
https://openalex.org/W2115941382,"Adaptive nonshivering thermogenesis may have profound effects on energy balance and is therefore therefore is a potential mechanism for counteracting the development of obesity. The molecular basis for adaptive nonshivering thermogenesis has remained a challenge that sparked acute interest with the identification of proteins (UCP2, UCP3, etc.) with high-sequence similarity to the original uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1), which is localized only in brown adipose tissue. Using UCP1-ablated mice, we examined whether any adaptive nonshivering thermogenesis could be recruited by acclimation to cold. Remarkably, by successive acclimation, the UCP1-ablated mice could be made to subsist for several weeks at 4C during which they had to constantly produce heat at four times their resting levels. Despite these extreme requirements for adaptive nonshivering thermogenesis, however, no substitution of shivering by any adaptive nonshivering thermogenic process occurred. Thus, although the existence of, for example, muscular mechanisms for adaptive nonshivering thermogenesis has recurrently been implied, we did not find any indication of such thermogenesis. Not even during prolonged and enhanced demand for extra heat production was any endogenous hormone or neurotransmitter able to recruit any UCP1-independent adaptive nonshivering thermogenic process in muscle or in any other organ, and no proteins other than UCP1-not even UCP2 or UCP3-therefore have the ability to mediate adaptive nonshivering thermogenesis in the cold."
https://openalex.org/W2021424485,"We characterized an activation mechanism of the human LTRPC2 protein, a member of the transient receptor potential family of ion channels, and demonstrated that LTRPC2 mediates Ca2+ influx into immunocytes. Intracellular pyrimidine nucleotides, adenosine 5'-diphosphoribose (ADPR), and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), directly activated LTRPC2, which functioned as a Ca2+-permeable nonselective cation channel and enabled Ca2+ influx into cells. This activation was suppressed by intracellular adenosine triphosphate. These results reveal that ADPR and NAD act as intracellular messengers and may have an important role in Ca2+ influx by activating LTRPC2 in immunocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2075774799,"Lightly etched single-walled carbon nanotubes are chemically reacted to form rings. The rings appear to be fully closed as opposed to open coils, as ring-opening reactions did not change the structure of the observed rings. The average diameter of the rings was 540 nanometers with a narrow size distribution. The nanotubes in solution were modeled as wormlike polymer chains, yielding a persistence length of 800 nanometers. Nanotubes shorter than this length behave stiffly and stay nearly straight in solution. However, nanotubes longer than the Kuhn segment length of 1600 nanometers undergo considerable thermal fluctuation, suggesting a greater flexibility of these materials than is generally assumed."
https://openalex.org/W2028728539,"The yeast prion [PSI(+)] results from self-propagating aggregates of Sup35p. De novo formation of [PSI(+)] requires an additional non-Mendelian trait, thought to result from a prion form of one or more unknown proteins. We find that the Gln/Asn-rich prion domains of two proteins, New1p and Rnq1p, can control susceptibility to [PSI(+)] induction as well as enhance aggregation of a human glutamine expansion disease protein. [PSI(+)] inducibility results from gain-of-function properties of New1p and Rnq1p aggregates rather than from inactivation of the normal proteins. These studies suggest a molecular basis for the epigenetic control of [PSI(+)] inducibility and may reveal a broader role for this phenomenon in the physiology of protein aggregation."
https://openalex.org/W2105068336,"To examine the community-wide effects of introduced biocontrol agents on Kauai Island, Hawaii, we constructed quantitative food webs showing interactions among plants, moths, and moth parasitoids in a native forest. Eighty-three percent of parasitoids reared from native moths were biological control agents, 14% were accidental immigrants, and 3% were native species. Although parasitism by biological control agents reached 28% in some species of moth, all biocontrol agents reared had been released before 1945. This study highlights the importance of considering the potential damage caused by an introduced control agent, in addition to that caused by the target alien species."
https://openalex.org/W2032607892,"The LKB1 tumor suppressor gene, mutated in Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, encodes a serine/threonine kinase of unknown function. Here we show that mice with a targeted disruption of Lkb1 die at midgestation, with the embryos showing neural tube defects, mesenchymal cell death, and vascular abnormalities. Extraembryonic development was also severely affected; the mutant placentas exhibited defective labyrinth layer development and the fetal vessels failed to invade the placenta. These phenotypes were associated with tissue-specific deregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) expression, including a marked increase in the amount of VEGF messenger RNA. Moreover, VEGF production in cultured Lkb1 −/− fibroblasts was elevated in both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. These findings place Lkb1 in the VEGF signaling pathway and suggest that the vascular defects accompanying Lkb1 loss are mediated at least in part by VEGF."
https://openalex.org/W2139485867,"The competitive binding of a molecule forming a liquid crystal and a targeted analyte to a common molecular receptor presented at a solid surface possessing nanometer-scale topography is used to trigger an easily visualized surface-driven change in the orientation of a micrometer-thick film of liquid crystal. Diffusion of the targeted analyte from atmosphere to surface-immobilized receptor across the micrometer-thick film of liquid crystal is fast (on the order of seconds), and the competitive interaction of the targeted analyte and liquid crystal with the receptor provides a high level of tolerance to nontargeted species (water, ethanol, acetone, and hexanes). Systems that provide parts-per-billion (by volume) sensitivity to either organoamine or organophosphorus compounds are demonstrated, and their use for imaging of spatial gradients in concentration is reported. This approach does not require complex instrumentation and could provide the basis of wearable personalized sensors for measurement of real-time and cumulative exposure to environmental agents."
https://openalex.org/W1982768907,"We generated a coherently synthesized optical pulse from two independent mode-locked femtosecond lasers, providing a route to extend the coherent bandwidth available for ultrafast science. The two separate lasers (one centered at 760 nanometers wavelength, the other at 810 nanometers) are tightly synchronized and phase-locked. Coherence between the two lasers is demonstrated via spectral interferometry and second-order field cross-correlation. Measurements reveal a coherently synthesized pulse that has a temporally narrower second-order autocorrelation width and that exhibits a larger amplitude than the individual laser outputs. This work represents a new and flexible approach to the synthesis of coherent light."
https://openalex.org/W1966942208,"The complex series of movements that mediates chromosome segregation during mitosis is dependent on the attachment of microtubules to kinetochores, DNA-protein complexes that assemble on centromeric DNA. We describe the use of live-cell imaging and chromatin immunoprecipitation in S. cerevisiae to identify ten kinetochore subunits, among which are yeast homologs of microtubule binding proteins in animal cells. By analyzing conditional mutations in several of these proteins, we show that they are required for the imposition of tension on paired sister kinetochores and for correct chromosome movement. The proteins include both molecular motors and microtubule associated proteins (MAPs), implying that motors and MAPs function together in binding chromosomes to spindle microtubules."
https://openalex.org/W2127137167,"The biogenic amine The biogenic amine N1-acetyl-N2-formyl-5-methoxykynuramine (AFMK) was investigated for its potential antioxidative capacity. AFMK is a metabolite generated through either an enzymatic or a chemical reaction pathway from melatonin. The physiological function of AFMK remains unknown. To our knowledge, this report is the first to document the potent antioxidant action of this biogenic amine. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) shows that AFMK donates two electrons at potentials of 456 mV and 668 mV, and therefore it functions as a reductive force. This function contrasts with all other physiological antioxidants that donate a single electron only when they neutralize free radicals. AFMK reduced 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine formation induced by the incubation of DNA with oxidants significantly. Lipid peroxidation resulting from free radical damage to rat liver homogenates was also prevented by the addition of AFMK. The inhibitory effects of AFMK on both DNA and lipid damage appear to be dose-response related. In cell culture, AFMK efficiently reduced hippocampal neuronal death induced by either hydrogen peroxide, glutamate, or amyloid b25-35 peptide. AFMK is a naturally occurring molecule with potent free radical scavenging capacity (donating two electrons/molecule) and thus may be a valuable new antioxidant for preventing and treating free radical-related disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2163401883,"Platelet aggregation and subsequent thrombosis are the major cause of ischemic diseases such as heart attack and stroke. ADP, acting via G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), is an important signal in thrombus formation and involves activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K). When platelets from mice lacking the G protein-activated PI3Kgamma isoform were stimulated with ADP, aggregation was impaired. Collagen or thrombin, however, evoked a normal response. ADP stimulation of PI3Kgamma-deficient platelets resulted in decreased PKB/Akt phosphorylation and alpha(IIb)beta(3) fibrinogen receptor activation. These effects did not influence bleeding time but protected PI3Kgamma-null mice from death caused by ADP-induced platelet-dependent thromboembolic vascular occlusion. This result demonstrates an unsuspected, well-defined role for PI3Kgamma downstream of ADP and suggests that pharmacological targeting of PI3Kgamma has a potential use as antithrombotic therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2033144355,"Defects in the layering of Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films can be eliminated by depositing from the appropriate monolayer phase at the air-water interface. LB films deposited from the hexagonal phase of cadmium arachidate (CdA2) at pH 7 spontaneously transform into the bulk soap structure, a centrosymmetric bilayer with an orthorhombic herringbone packing. A large wavelength folding mechanism accelerates the conversion between the two structures, leading to a disruption of the desired layering. At pH > 8.5, though it is more difficult to draw LB films, almost perfect layering is obtained due to the inability to convert from the as-deposited structure to the equilibrium one."
https://openalex.org/W2153127129,"During development, Hox gene transcription is activated in presomitic mesoderm with a time sequence that follows the order of the genes along the chromosome. Here, we show that Hoxd1 and other Hox genes display dynamic stripes of expression within presomitic mesoderm. The underlying transcriptional bursts may reflect the mechanism that coordinates Hox gene activation with somitogenesis. This mechanism appears to depend upon Notch signaling, as mice deficient for RBPJk, the effector of the Notch pathway, showed severely reduced Hoxd gene expression in presomitic mesoderm. These results suggest a molecular link between Hox gene activation and the segmentation clock. Such a linkage would efficiently keep in phase the production of novel segments with their morphological specification."
https://openalex.org/W2096377599,"Many arachidonic acid metabolites function in growth signaling for epithelial cells, and we previously reported the expression of the major arachidonic acid enzymes in human breast cancer cell lines. To evaluate the role of the 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) pathway on breast cancer growth regulation, we exposed cells to insulinlike growth factor-1 or transferrin, which increased the levels of the 5-LO metabolite, 5(S)-hydrooxyeicosa-6E,8C,11Z,14Z-tetraenoic acid (5-HETE), by radioimmunoassay and high-performance liquid chromatography. Addition of 5-HETE to breast cancer cells resulted in growth stimulation, whereas selective biochemical inhibitors of 5-LO reduced the levels of 5-HETE and related metabolites. Application of 5-LO or 5-LO activating protein-directed inhibitors, but not a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, reduced growth, increased apoptosis, down-regulated bcl-2, up-regulated bax, and increased G1 arrest. Exposure of breast cancer cells to a 5-LO inhibitor up-regulated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)a and PPARg expression, and these same cells were growth inhibited when exposed to relevant PPAR agonists. These results suggest that disruption of the 5-LO signaling pathway mediates growth arrest and apoptosis in breast cancer cells. Additional experiments suggest that this involves the interplay of several factors, including the loss of growth stimulation by 5-LO products, the induction of PPARg, and the potential activation of PPARg by interactions with shunted endoperoxides."
https://openalex.org/W2118017964,"Our previous study showed that tea polyphenols inhibited MAP kinase and AP-1 activities in mouse epidermal JB6 cells and the corresponding H-ras-transformed cell line 30.7b Ras 12. The present study investigated the mechanisms of this inhibition. The cells were incubated with (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) or theaflavin-3,3'-digallate (TFdiG) (20 mM) for different times, and the cell lysate was analyzed by immunoblotting. EGCG treatment decreased the levels of phospho-Erk1/2 and -MEK1/2 time-dependently (by 60% at 60 min). TFdiG lowered their levels by 38%-50% at 15 min. TFdiG effectively decreased total Raf-1 protein levels, most likely through lysosomal degradation. EGCG did not affect protein levels or the activity of Raf-1 significantly but decreased its association with MEK1 as determined by co-immunoprecipitation. In addition, EGCG and TFdiG (10 mM) inhibited the phosphorylation of Elk-1 by isolated phospho-Erk1/2 in vitro. This inhibition of Erk1/2 activity is Elk-1 concentration-dependent and ATP concentration-independent, which suggests that EGCG and TFdiG interfere with the binding of the protein substrate to the kinase. The presently demonstrated specific mechanisms of inhibition of MAP kinases by EGCG and TFdiG may help us to understand the effects of tea consumption on cancer, inflammatory diseases, and cardiovascular diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2128761672,"Cardiac hypertrophy as an adaptation to increased blood pressure leads to an increase in ventricular expression of transforming growth factor Cardiac hypertrophy as an adaptation to increased blood pressure leads to an increase in ventricular expression of transforming growth factor b (TGF-b), probably via the renin-angiotensin system. We studied in vivo to determine whether angiotensin II affects TGF-b expression independent from mechanical effects caused by the concomitant increase in blood pressure and in vitro intracellular signaling involved in angiotensin II-dependent TGF-b1 induction. In vivo, the AT1 receptor antagonist losartan, but not reduction of blood pressure by hydralazine, inhibited the increase in TGF-b1 expression caused by angiotensin II. In vitro, angiotensin II caused an induction of TGF-b1 expression in adult ventricular cardiomyocytes and induced AP-1 binding activity. Transfection with ""decoys"" directed against the binding site of AP-1 binding proteins inhibited the angiotensin II-dependent TGF-b induction. Angiotensin II induced TGF-b expression in a p38-MAP kinase-dependent way. p38-MAP kinase activation was diminished in presence of the antioxidants or diphenyleneiodium chloride, or by pretreatment with antisense nucleotides directed against phox22 and nox, components of smooth muscle type NAD(P)H oxidase. Thus, our study identifies a previously unrecognized coupling of cardiac AT receptors to a NAD(P)H oxidase complex similar to that expressed in smooth muscle cells and identifies p38-MAP kinase activation as an important downstream target."
https://openalex.org/W1970512089,"Organelle transport by myosin-V is down-regulated during mitosis, presumably by myosin-V phosphorylation. We used mass spectrometry phosphopeptide mapping to show that the tail of myosin-V was phosphorylated in mitotic Xenopus egg extract on a single serine residue localized in the carboxyl-terminal organelle-binding domain. Phosphorylation resulted in the release of the motor from the organelle. The phosphorylation site matched the consensus sequence of calcium/calmodulin–dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), and inhibitors of CaMKII prevented myosin-V release. The modulation of cargo binding by phosphorylation is likely to represent a general mechanism regulating organelle transport by myosin-V."
https://openalex.org/W2004151210,"Worldwide more than 200 million individuals are allergic to group 1 grass pollen allergens. We have used the major timothy grass pollen allergen Phl p 1, which cross-reacts with most grass-, corn-, and monocot-derived group 1 allergens to develop a generally applicable strategy for the production of hypoallergenic allergy vaccines. On the basis of the experimentally determined B cell epitopes of Phl p 1, we have synthesized five synthetic peptides. These peptides are derived from the major Phl p 1 IgE epitopes and were between 28-32 amino acids long. We demonstrate by nuclear magnetic resonance that the peptides exhibit no secondary and tertiary structure and accordingly failed to bind IgE antibodies from grass pollen allergic patients. The five peptides, as well as an equimolar mixture thereof, lacked allergenic activity as demonstrated by basophil histamine release and skin test experiments in grass pollen allergic patients. When used as immunogens in mice and rabbits, the peptides induced protective IgG antibodies, which recognized the complete Phl p 1 wild-type allergen and group 1 allergens from other grass species. Moreover, peptide-induced antibodies inhibited the binding of grass pollen allergic patients IgE antibodies to the wild-type allergen. We thus demonstrate that synthetic hypoallergenic peptides derived from B cell epitopes of major allergens represent safe vaccine candidates for the treatment of IgE- mediated allergies."
https://openalex.org/W2129457993,"An estimated 100 million individuals suffer from birch pollen allergy. Specific immunotherapy, the only curative allergy treatment, can cause life-threatening anaphylactic side effects. Here, we report the genetic engineering of a recombinant trimer consisting of three covalently linked copies of the major birch pollen allergen, Bet v 1. The trimer exhibited profoundly reduced allergenic activity but contained similar secondary structures such as Bet v 1 wild type, Bet v 1-specific B cell and T-cell epitopes, and induced Th1 cytokine release. As immunogen, rBet v 1 trimer induced IgG antibodies, which blocked patients' IgE binding to Bet v 1 and related allergens. Thus, rBet v 1 trimer represents a novel hypoallergenic vaccine prototype for treatment of one of the most frequent allergy forms."
https://openalex.org/W2098458465,"Systemic stresses induce corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) expression in hypothalamus. CRH is released to the pituitary gland, where it stimulates proopiomelanocortin (POMC) production acting via the CRH receptor (CRH-R). CRH and POMC peptides are also detected in sites outside of the central nervous system (CNS), such as the skin. However, it has not been elucidated whether these peptides detected in the skin are derived from CNS or are produced locally. Using immunohistochemical and in situ reverse-transcription (RT)-PCR techniques, we demonstrated coexpression of CRH and POMC mRNAs in the epidermis and pilosebaceous units of the human skin. This coexpression was confirmed by the combination of laser-capture microdissection (LCM) with RT-PCR, analyzing mRNA expressions in captured sebaceous cells. Immunoreactivities and expressions of CRH and POMC mRNAs were strong in inflammatory lesions, melanocytic nevus, seborrheic keratosis, and also in the periphery of the benign tumor. These findings suggest that CRH and POMC peptides are produced locally in the skin and are regulated by inflammatory cells as well as by autocrine mechanisms. The skin may have ""a local stress response system,"" whose activity is mediated by CRH and POMC peptides, in an equivalent to hypothalamus-pituitary adrenal axis."
https://openalex.org/W2113180123,"The regulation of transcription elongation and termination appears to be governed by the ability of RNA polymerase elongation complexes to adopt multiple conformational states; however, the factors controlling the distribution between these states remain elusive. We used transient-state kinetics to investigate the incorporation of single nucleotides. We demonstrate that E. coli RNA polymerase contains an allosteric binding site in addition to the catalytic site. Binding of the templated nucleoside triphosphate (NTP), but not nontemplated NTPs, to this site increases the rate of nucleotide incorporation. The data suggest that RNA polymerase can exist in a state that catalyzes synthesis slowly (unactivated) and one that catalyzes synthesis rapidly (activated), with the transition from the slow to the fast state being induced by binding of the templated NTP to the allosteric site."
https://openalex.org/W2057220712,"The haplodiploid sex-determination system of ants gives rise to conflict between queens and workers over colony sex ratios, and the female-biased allocation ratios seen in many species suggest that workers often prevail in this conflict. We exchanged queens between male- and female-specialist colonies of the fire ant Solenopsis invicta. These exchanges quickly reversed the sex-ratio biases of adopting colonies. The sex ratio of queen-laid eggs differed strongly between male- and female-specialist colonies. These findings suggest that queens can force workers to raise male sexuals by limiting the number of female brood and help to explain why sex investment ratios lie between the queen and worker equilibria in this and many other ant species."
https://openalex.org/W1833099573,"The presence of astrocyte precursor cells (APCs) and time course and topography of astrocyte differentiation during development were investigated by triple-label immunohistochemistry with intact fetal and adult human retinas. Throughout retinal development and adulthood, expression of Pax2 was restricted to cells of the astrocytic lineage. Three distinct stages of astrocytic differentiation were identified during development: i) Pax2+/vimentin+/GFAP- APCs; ii) Pax2+/vimentin+/GFAP+ immature perinatal astrocytes; and iii) Pax2+/vimentin-/GFAP+ mature perinatal astrocytes. In adult, cells with the antigenic phenotype of mature perinatal astrocytes were restricted to a region surrounding the optic nerve head (ONH), whereas cells at a fourth stage of differentiation, adult astrocytes (Pax2-/vimentin-/GFAP+), were apparent throughout the vascularized retina. APC appearance was centered around the ONH and preceded the appearance of perinatal astrocytes. A cluster of Pax2+ somas was also present in a small region surrounding the ONH at the ventricular surface of the developing retina, which suggests the existence of two distinct sites of astrocytic differentiation. The coincidence in the location of APCs and perinatal astrocytes at the ventricular zone with that of optic nerve colobomas, together with the association of Pax2 gene mutations with this condition, suggests that coloboma formation may result from impaired astrocyte differentiation during development."
https://openalex.org/W2145995281,"Partial hepatectomy (PH) triggers a rapid regenerative response in the remaining tissue to reinstate the organ function and the cell numbers. Among the molecules that change in the course of regeneration is an accumulation of prostaglandin E2 in the sera of rats with PH. Analysis of the cyclooxygenase (COX) isoenzymes in the remnant liver showed the preferential expression of COX-2 in hepatocytes. Cultured regenerating hepatocytes expressed significant levels of COX-2, a process that was not observed in the sham counterparts. Maximal expression of COX-2 was detected 16 h after PH with increased levels present even at 96 h. Pharmacological inhibition of COX-2 activity with NS398 shunted the up-regulation of cell proliferation after PH, which suggests a positive interaction of prostaglandins with the progression of the cell cycle. Similar results were obtained after PH of mice lacking the COX-2 gene. The expression of COX-2 in regenerating liver was concomitant with a decrease in CCAAT-enhancer binding protein (C/EBP-a) level and an increase in the expression of C/EBP-b and C/EBP-d. These results suggest a contribution of the enhanced synthesis of prostaglandins to liver regeneration observed after PH."
https://openalex.org/W2123101763,"Glucocorticoids (GCs) are potent inhibitors of epidermal proliferation and effective anti-inflammatory compounds, which make them the drug of choice for a wide range of inflammatory and hyperproliferative skin disorders. GC action is mediated via the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). To study the role of GR in skin development and the molecular mechanisms underlying its action, we generated transgenic mice overexpressing GR in epidermis and other stratified epithelia, under the control of the keratin K5 promoter. Newborn mice show altered skin development, manifested as variable-sized skin lesions that range from epidermal hypoplasia and underdeveloped dysplastic hair follicles to a complete absence of this tissue. In the most affected individuals, skin was absent at the cranial and umbilical regions, and the vibrissae and eyebrows appear scarce, short, and curly. In addition, as a consequence of transgene expression in other ectodermally derived epithelia, K5-GR mice exhibited further abnormalities that strikingly resemble the clinical findings in patients with ectodermal dysplasia, which includes aplasia cutis congenita. In adult transgenic skin, topical application of the tumor promoter TPA did not elicit hyperplasia or transcriptional induction of several proinflammatory cytokines. This anti-inflammatory role of GR was due at least in part to interference with NF-kB, leading to a strong reduction in the kB-binding activity without altering the transcriptional levels of the inhibitor IkBa."
https://openalex.org/W2164049493,"The skeletal muscle mitochondrial uncoupling protein-3 (UCP3) promotes substrate oxidation, but direct evidence for its metabolic role is lacking. Here, we show that UCP3 overexpression in cultured human muscle cells decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (DYm). Despite this, the ATP content was not significantly decreased compared with control cells, whereas ADP content was reduced and thus the ATP/ADP ratio raised. This finding was contrasts with the effect caused by the chemical protonophoric uncoupler, CCCP, which lowered DYm, ATP, and the ATP/ADP ratio. UCP3-overexpression enhanced oxidation of oleate, regardless of the presence of glucose, whereas etomoxir, which blocks fatty acid entry to mitochondria, suppressed the UCP3 effect. Glucose oxidation was stimulated in UCP3-overexpressing cells, but this effect was inhibited by oleate. UCP3 caused weak increase of both 2-Deoxyglucose uptake and glycolytic rate, which differed from the marked stimulation by CCCP. We concluded that UCP3 promoted nutrient oxidation by lowering DYm and enhanced fatty acid-dependent inhibition of glucose oxidation. Unlike the uncoupler CCCP, however, UCP3 raised the ATP/ADP ratio and modestly increased glucose uptake and glycolysis. We propose that this differential effect provides a biological significance to UCP3, which is up-regulated in metabolic stress situations where it could be involved in nutrient partitioning."

The sediment distributions of lead, stable lead isotope ratios, and lead-210 in the major Arctic Ocean basins reveal close coupling of the Eurasian Basin with the North Atlantic during the 20th century. They indicate that the Atlantic water boundary current in the Eurasian Basin has been a prominent pathway, that contaminant lead from the Laptev Sea supplies surface water in the transpolar drift, and that the Canadian and Eurasian basins have been historically decoupled."

 Mysak
 highlights the report by
 Gobeil
 et al. , who have studied lead concentration in sediments in the Arctic Ocean. These sediments accumulated over a period of several decades when the high-latitude atmospheric circulation was in a very stable (negative) state and the Atlantic inflow probably did not penetrate very far into the Arctic Basin. The atmospheric circulation has now entered a positive state, in which pollutants entering the ocean from Western Europe are likely to penetrate farther into the Arctic and might even reach the Canadian Basin."
https://openalex.org/W2128336612,"Six days of microgravity (Bion10 mission) induced dramatic shape changes in ROS 17/2.8 osteoblasts (7). During the Foton 11 and 12 space flights, we studied the kinetics (0-4 days) of ROS 17/2.8 morphology and adhesion, the relationships between adhesion and cell cycle progression after 4 days in space, and osteoblastic growth and activity after 6 days in space. Quantitative analysis of high-resolution adhesion [focal adhesion area imaged by total interference reflection fluorescent microscopy (TIRFM)] and integrin-dependent adhesion (imaged on confocal microscope by vinculin and phosphotyrosine staining) as well as cell cycle phase classification [Ki-67 staining, S-G2, mitotic cells and G1 (postmitotic cells)] were performed using programs validated in parabolic flight and clinostat. We observed disorganization of the cytoskeleton associated with disassembling of vinculin spots and phosphorylated proteins within focal contacts with no major change in TIRFM adhesion after 2 and 4 days of microgravity. Postmitotic cells, alone, accounted for the differences observed in the whole population. They are characterized by immature peripheral contacts with complete loss of central spots and decreased spreading. Osteocalcin, P1CP and alkaline phosphatase, and proliferation were similar in flight cells and 1 g centrifuge and ground controls after 6 days. In conclusion, microgravity substantially affected osteoblastic integrin-mediated cell adhesion. ROS17/2.8 cells responded differently, whether or not they were cycling by reorganizing adhesion plaque topography or morphology. In ROS 17/2.8, this reorganization did not impair osteoblastic phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2169937508,"Many galaxies have taken on their familiar appearance relatively recently. In the distant Universe, galaxy morphology deviates significantly (and systematically) from that of nearby galaxies at redshifts ( z ) as low as 0.3. This corresponds to a time ∼3.5 × 10 9 years in the past, which is only ∼25% of the present age of the Universe. Beyond z = 0.5 (5 × 10 9 years in the past), spiral arms are less well developed and more chaotic, and barred spiral galaxies may become rarer. At z = 1, around 30% of the galaxy population is sufficiently peculiar that classification on Hubble's traditional “tuning fork” system is meaningless. On the other hand, some characteristics of galaxies have not changed much over time. The space density of luminous disk galaxies has not changed significantly since z = 1, indicating that although the general appearance of these galaxies has continuously changed over time, their overall numbers have been conserved."
https://openalex.org/W1513916984,"Somatostatin receptor sst2 is an inhibitory G protein-coupled receptor, which inhibits normal and tumor cell growth by a mechanism involving the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1. We reported previously that SHP-1 associates transiently with and is activated by sst2 and is a critical component for sst2 growth inhibitory signaling. Here, we demonstrate that in Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing sst2, SHP-1 is associated at the basal level with the neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS). Following sst2 activation by the somatostatin analog RC-160, SHP-1 rapidly recruits nNOS tyrosine dephosphorylates and activates it. The resulting NO activates guanylate cyclase and inhibits cell proliferation. Coexpression of a catalytically inactive SHP-1 mutant with sst2 blocks RC-160-induced nNOS dephosphorylation and activation, as well as guanylate cyclase activation. In mouse pancreatic acini, RC-160 treatment reduces nNOS tyrosine phosphorylation accompanied by an increase of its activity. By opposition, in acini from viable motheaten (mev/mev) mice, which express a markedly inactive SHP-1, RC-160 has no effect on nNOS activity. Finally, expression of a dominant-negative form of nNOS prevents both RC-160-induced p27 up-regulation and cell proliferation inhibition. We therefore identified nNOS as a novel SHP-1 substrate critical for sst2-induced cell-growth arrest."
https://openalex.org/W2148199515,"Manganese superoxide dismutase Mn-SOD plays a major role in protecting mitochondria from oxidative damage. Overexpression of Mn-SOD maintains cell survival under conditions that lead to apoptotic death. In addition to the antioxidative enzyme, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is a principal survival factor that inhibits apoptosis and promotes proliferation by activating survival signaling pathways in various cells. Here we show that PDGF induced the expression of the Mn-SOD gene in NIH3T3 cells, and its induction was associated with early growth response-1 (Egr-1), a transcription factor. An electrophoretic mobility shift assay demonstrated that Egr-1 bound to the proximal promoter of the Mn-SOD gene in response to PDGF. The proximal promoter region of Mn-SOD was shown to be transcriptionally responsive to both basal and PDGF stimulation by transfection studies. Forced expression of Egr-1 in the cells activated Mn-SOD transcription in a dose-dependent manner. The pathway by which PDGF induced Egr-1 involved the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-1 (MEK1) and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), because the effect of PDGF on the induction of Egr-1 was blocked by U0126, a specific MEK1 inhibitor. These findings indicate that the induction of Mn-SOD is part of the anti-apoptotic properties mediated by PDGF."
https://openalex.org/W2103656160,"Male infertility is often attributed to stress. However, the protein or proteins that mediate stress-related infertility are not yet known. Overexpression of the ""readthrough"" variant of acetylcholinesterase (AChE-R) is involved in the cellular stress response in a variety of mammalian tissues. Here, we report testicular overexpression of AChE-R in heads, but not tails, of postmeiotic spermatozoa from mice subjected to a transient psychological stress compared with age-matched control mice. Transgenic mice overexpressing AChE-R displayed reduced sperm counts, decreased seminal gland weight, and impaired sperm motility compared with age-matched nontransgenic controls. AChE-R was prominent in meiotic phase spermatocytes and in tails, but not heads, of testicular spermatozoa from AChE-R transgenic mice. Head-localized AChE-R was characteristic of human sperm from fertile donors. In contrast, sperm head AChE-R staining was conspicuously reduced in samples from human couples for whom the cause of infertility could not be determined, similar to the pattern found in transgenic mice. These findings indicate AChE-R involvement in impaired sperm quality, which suggests that it is a molecular marker for stress-related infertility."
https://openalex.org/W2103074506,"Membrane-type matrix metalloproteinases-1 and -3 (MT1- and MT3-MMPs) are expressed by activated smooth muscle cells (SMCs) both in vitro and in vivo (19). To define their functions in SMCs, we transduced MT1- and MT3-MMP cDNAs into baboon SMCs by using adenoviral vectors. Overexpression of MT1-MMP increased the conversion of proMMP-2 to the intermediate and active forms. In contrast, in MT3-MMP-overexpressing cells, MMP-2 was activated partially. Immunoblot analyses revealed that MT1-MMP protein was present in the SMCs and accumulated in the presence of the synthetic MMP inhibitor, BB94, or tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2). However, MT3-MMP protein was detectable only when BB94, but not TIMP-2, was present. Zymographic analyses showed that MT3-MMP had much stronger casein- and gelatin-degrading activities than did MT1-MMP. Furthermore, when MT3-MMP and MT1-MMP were coexpressed, MT1-MMP degradation was enhanced; this result supports the possibility that MT3-MMP can degrade MT1-MMP. SMCs overexpressing either MT1- or MT3-MMP exhibited altered morphology, without changing their proliferation. This alteration was prevented by BB94 addition. The cells, which underwent this change, showed reduced adhesion to both collagen and fibronectin and increased migration in a Boyden chamber. The present study demonstrates that MT1- and MT3-MMPs have different enzymatic activities but may nevertheless affect SMC function in the same way."
https://openalex.org/W2060811060,"Although initiation of chromosome condensation during early prophase is linked temporally to the appearance of the mitotic cdc2 kinase in the nucleus, it is not known what targets the kinase to the nucleus and how this is coupled to chromatin remodeling. We now report that cdc2 kinase forms stable molecular complexes with the nuclear enzyme DNA topoisomerase II, which is associated with marked stimulation of both DNA binding and catalytic activity of topoisomerase II, albeit in a phosphorylation-independent manner. The molecular interaction is required for recruitment of cdc2 kinase, as shown by incubation of purified enzymes with chicken erythrocyte nuclei, which have neither endogenous topoisomerase II nor cdc2 kinase. The physical association between the two enzymes alters the DNA/topoisomerase II interaction as shown by pulse-field electrophoresis after incubation of intact nuclei with the specific topoisomerase II inhibitor VM-26. Furthermore, the presence of both enzymes, but not either enzyme alone, is accompanied by extensive chromatin remodeling converting the interphase nuclei into precondensation chromosomes with striking resemblance to early prophase structures. Our results reveal a novel property of cyclin-dependent kinases and demonstrate that the recruitment of cdc2 kinase by topoisomerase II is coupled to chromatin remodeling."
https://openalex.org/W2076213681,"Polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) are the major source of proteolytic activities involved mainly in tissue injuries observed in chronic inflammatory disorders. High levels of soluble forms of CD23 (the low-affinity receptor for IgE) were found in biological fluids from these patients, and recent reports focused on a CD23-mediated regulation of inflammatory response. In this context, we show here that co-culture of activated PMN with CD23+ B cells resulted in a drastic release of soluble CD23 fragments from the cell surface. This cleavage was inhibited by serine proteases inhibitors, including a1-antitrypsin. We next demonstrated that purified human leukocyte elastase or cathepsin G efficiently cleaved membrane CD23 on B cells with a high specificity. Soluble fragments released by serine proteases-mediated CD23 proteolysis stimulated resting monocytes to produce oxidative burst and proinflammatory cytokine without any co-stimulatory signal. This work strongly supports the idea that the capacity of PMN-derived proteases to release soluble forms of CD23 participates in the inflammatory process mediated by these cells."
https://openalex.org/W2166407992,"The distributions of synthesis rates of expressed proteins in a liquid batch culture of the prokaryote S. coelicolor during 3 days' growth have been analyzed by using a law governing the relation between the synthesis rates and the corresponding ranks in a list of rates (the so-called simplified canonical law, scl), which we have found previously to characterize the distribution of prokaryotic protein expression. The scl remains valid throughout development and the two parameters of the distribution, q and r, evolve in a highly characteristic and revealing way. q is a measure of the degree to which available genomic resources are used, in the sense of exploiting their potential diversity. The passage from one developmental phase to another is marked by a sharp peak in q, as these resources are fully mobilized to deal with a crisis (i.e., exhaustion of the habitual food supply). This is followed by an even more pronounced trough, as the organism briefly focuses its resources on synthesizing just those proteins most essential for survival, especially those hitherto unavailable and needed for metabolizing the new nutrient source. The parameter r indicates redundancy among the most abundantly expressed proteins: higher r corresponds to more diversity; i.e., less duplication of function, hence less robustness. This parameter is relatively steady throughout the development of the culture, except for a pronounced peak during the developmental phase transition. This corresponds to the ""emergency mode"" characterized by extremely low q, during which a minimum repertoire of proteins is expressed."
