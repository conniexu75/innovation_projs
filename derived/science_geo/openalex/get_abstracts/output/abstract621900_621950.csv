https://openalex.org/W2900201798,"Combine and conquer Platinum (Pt)–group metals, which are scarce and expensive, are used for the demanding oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in hydrogen fuel cells. One competing approach for reducing their use is to create nanoparticles with earth-abundant metals to increase their activity and surface area; another is to replace them with metals such as cobalt (Co) in carbide or nitride sites. Chong et al. thermally activated a Co metal-organic framework compound to create ORR-active Co sites and then grew PtCo alloy nanoparticles on this substrate. The resulting catalyst had high activity and durability, despite its relatively low Pt content. Science , this issue p. 1276"

To understand how humans diverged and spread across North and South America, Moreno-Mayar et al. sequenced 15 ancient human genomes from Alaska to Patagonia. Analysis of the oldest genomes suggests that there was an early split within Beringian populations, giving rise to the Northern and Southern lineages. Because population history cannot be explained by simple models or patterns of dispersal, it seems that people moved out of Beringia and across the continents in a complex manner.

https://openalex.org/W2900391803,"Adding to the cross-presentation family Immune responses to viral or tumor antigens are typically initiated by the process of cross-presentation. Cross-presentation is believed to be the major way that innate immune cells, such as the classical dendritic cell 1 (cDC1) subset, activate and prime immunological T cells. Theisen et al. used CRISPR-based screening to identify regulators of cross-presentation by cDC1s (see the Perspective by Barbet and Blander). One such regulator that was identified, WDFY4 (WD repeat- and FYVE domain–containing protein 4), was required for cross-presentation of cell- and bacterial-associated antigens. WDFY4 played a critical role in cDC1-mediated viral and tumor immunity yet did not seem necessary for major histocompatibility complex class II presentation or for cross-presentation by monocyte-derived DCs.

However, the mechanism behind this reduction is unclear. Crall et al. performed complex real-time monitoring of bumblebee behavior within their nests (see the Perspective by Raine). Neonicotinoid exposure reduced nurse and caretaking behaviors, which affected productivity and harmed colony thermoregulation. These changes in behavior acted together to decrease colony viability, even when exposure was nonlethal. Science , this issue p. 683 ; see also p. 643"
https://openalex.org/W2899699117,"Efflux pumps and mutation Antibiotic resistance is an alarming and growing challenge. Bacteria show great heterogeneity in growth and mutation rates. Such variability allows some cells to persist during transient antibiotic exposure. During this persistent phase, mutations accumulate, which can result in selection for full-blown antibiotic resistance. El Meouche and Dunlop found that increased expression of efflux pumps on some cells affords them some relief from antibiotic toxicity. But up-regulating efflux pumps is costly for the bacteria, reducing growth rate and expression of MutS, a protein involved in DNA mismatch repair. These changes thus lift the lid on increased levels of bacterial mutation. Science , this issue p. 686"

Martin et al. wanted to determine the degree of recessive inheritance of DDs in protein-coding genes. They examined the exomes of more than 6000 families in populations with high and low proportions of consanguineous marriages. They found that 3.6% of DDs in individuals of European ancestry involved recessive coding disorders, less than a tenth of the levels previously estimated. Furthermore, among South Asians with high parental relatedness, rather than most of the disorders arising from inherited variants, fewer than half had a recessive coding diagnosis.

Dynamic filaments usually comprise independently folded and asymmetric proteins and using such building blocks requires the design of multiple intermonomer interfaces. Shen et al. report the design of self-assembling helical filaments based on previously designed stable repeat proteins. The filaments are micron scale, and their diameter can be tuned by varying the number of repeats in the monomer. Anchor and capping units, built from monomers that lack an interaction interface, can be used to control assembly and disassembly. Science , this issue p. 705"

Junctophilin-2 is a structural protein required for formation of the E-C coupling machinery. During heart disease, stress-activated calpain cleaves junctophilin-2, disrupting the E-C coupling machinery and calcium ion signaling, which compromises cell contraction. Guo et al. found that under stress conditions, calpain-mediated cleavage converted full-length junctophilin-2 from a structural protein into a transcriptional regulator that shuttled to the nucleus (see the Perspective by Padmanabhan and Haldar). Furthermore, failing cardiomyocytes in stressed myocardium transduced mechanical information (E-C uncoupling) into transcriptional reprogramming. Science , this issue p. eaan3303 ; see also p. 1359"

How is the sequential organization of place cell assemblies maintained across different time scales? Drieu et al. compared periods when a rat either sat passively on a moving train or ran actively on a treadmill on the same train. During the passive movement, the slow behavioral sequence of place cells was still present, but the rapid generation of theta sequences was lost. Active running on the treadmill, however, maintained the theta rhythm. After passive transport, sequence replay during sleep was destroyed, whereas active running protected replay.

https://openalex.org/W2900397067,"In bacteria, nascent proteins bear the pretranslationally generated N-terminal (Nt) formyl-methionine (fMet) residue. Nt-fMet of bacterial proteins is a degradation signal, termed fMet/N-degron. By contrast, proteins synthesized by cytosolic ribosomes of eukaryotes were presumed to bear unformylated Nt-Met. Here we found that the yeast formyltransferase Fmt1, although imported into mitochondria, could also produce Nt-formylated proteins in the cytosol. Nt-formylated proteins were strongly up-regulated in stationary phase or upon starvation for specific amino acids. This up-regulation strictly required the Gcn2 kinase, which phosphorylates Fmt1 and mediates its retention in the cytosol. We also found that the Nt-fMet residues of Nt-formylated proteins act as fMet/N-degrons and identified the Psh1 ubiquitin ligase as the recognition component of the eukaryotic fMet/N-end rule pathway, which destroys Nt-formylated proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2900238884,"Dendritic cells give mast cells a nudge Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening allergic reaction triggered after antigen-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies bind to target allergens. These antibodies then cross-link IgE-specific Fc receptors on the surface of mast cells. The mast cells rapidly release inflammatory mediators, including histamine, resulting in smooth muscle contraction, vasodilation, and blood vessel leakage. Because mast cells are usually found in the perivascular abluminal surface of blood vessels, it has been unclear how blood-borne allergens can interact with them. Choi et al. used live intravital imaging of the mouse vasculature to show that a specialized subset of dendritic cells sample blood-borne antigens and relay them to mast cells on the surface of microvesicles (see the Perspective by Levi-Schaffer and Scheffel). IgE-bound mast cells then vigorously degranulate after contact with these microvesicles. Science , this issue p. eaao0666 ; see also p. 640"

Moreover, hyperactivity of the transcription factor Nrf2 has been found to cause esophageal hyperproliferation and hyperkeratosis in mice. However, the underlying mechanism is unclear. In this study, we aimed to understand the molecular mechanisms of esophageal hyperproliferation in mice due to hyperactive Nrf2. Esophageal tissues were obtained from genetically modified mice that differed in the status of the Nrf2 gene and genes in the same pathway (Nrf2−/−, Keap1−/−, K5Cre;Pkm2fl/fl;Keap1−/−, and WT) and analyzed for metabolomic profiles, Nrf2 ChIP-seq, and gene expression. We found that hyperactive Nrf2 causes metabolic reprogramming and up-regulation of metabolic genes in the mouse esophagus. One of the glycolysis genes encoding pyruvate kinase M2 (Pkm2) was not only differentially up-regulated, but also glycosylated and oligomerized, resulting in increased ATP biosynthesis. However, constitutive knockout of Pkm2 failed to inhibit this esophageal phenotype in vivo, and this failure may have been due to compensation by Pkm1 up-regulation. Transient inhibition of NRF2 or glycolysis inhibited the growth of human ESCC cells in which NRF2 is hyperactive in vitro. In summary, hyperactive Nrf2 causes metabolic reprogramming in the mouse esophagus through its transcriptional regulation of metabolic genes.

https://openalex.org/W2899545168,"Molecular surveillance of newly diagnosed HIV-infections is important for tracking trends in circulating HIV-variants, including those with transmitted drug resistances (TDR) to sustain ART efficacy.Dried serum spots (DSS) are received together with the statutory notification of a new diagnosis. 'Recent infections' (<155 days) classified by a 'recent infection test algorithm' (BED-CEIA and clinical data) are genotyped in HIV-protease (PR), reverse transcriptase (RT) and integrase (INT) to determine the HIV-1 subtype, to calculate prevalence and trends of TDR, to predict baseline susceptibility and to identify potential transmission clusters for resistant variants.Between January 2013 and December 2016, 1,885 recent infections were analysed regarding the PR/RT genomic region, with 43.5% of these also being subjected to the analysis of INT. The proportion of HIV-1 non-B viruses (31.3%; 591/1,885) increased from 21.6% to 36.0%, particularly the subtypes A (5.0% to 8.3%) and C (3.2% to 7.7%; all ptrends < 0.01). The subtype A increment is mainly due to transmissions within men who have sex with men (MSM) while subtype C transmissions are associated with heterosexuals and people who inject drugs. The prevalence of TDR was stable at 11.0% (208/1,885) over the study period. Resistances to nucleotide RT inhibitors (NRTI) and PR inhibitors (PI) were 4.5% and 3.2%, respectively, without identifiable trends. In contrast, resistances to non-NRTIs (NNRTI, 4.7%) doubled between 2014 and 2016 from 3.2% to 6.4% (ptrend = 0.02) mainly due to the K103N mutation (from 1.7% to 4.1%; ptrend = 0.03) predominantly detected in recently infected German MSM not linked to transmission clusters. Transmitted INSTI mutations were present in only one case (T66I) and resistance to dolutegravir was not identified at all. Reduced susceptibility to recommended first-line therapies was low with 1.0% for PIs, 1.3% for NRTIs and 0.7% for INSTIs, but high for the NNRTIs efavirence (4.9%) and rilpivirine (6.0%) due to the K103N mutation and the polymorphic mutation E138A. These trends in therapy-naïve individuals impact current first-line regimens and require awareness and vigilant surveillance."

https://openalex.org/W2900266255,"In cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), the amyloid β (Aβ) peptide deposits along the vascular lumen, leading to degeneration and dysfunction of surrounding tissues. Activated coagulation factor XIIIa (FXIIIa) covalently cross-links proteins in blood and vasculature, such as in blood clots and on the extracellular matrix. Although FXIIIa co-localizes with Aβ in CAA, the ability of FXIIIa to cross-link Aβ has not been demonstrated. Using Western blotting, kinetic assays, and microfluidic analyses, we show that FXIIIa covalently cross-links Aβ40 into dimers and oligomers (kcat/Km = 1.5 × 105 m−1s−1), as well as to fibrin, platelet proteins, and blood clots under flow in vitro. Aβ40 also increased the stiffness of platelet-rich plasma clots in the presence of FXIIIa. These results suggest that FXIIIa-mediated cross-linking may contribute to the formation of Aβ deposits in CAA and Alzheimer's disease."
https://openalex.org/W2899685047,"Faithful chromosome segregation during mitosis is critical for maintaining genome integrity in cell progeny and relies on accurate and robust kinetochore–microtubule attachments. The NDC80 complex, a tetramer comprising kinetochore protein HEC1 (HEC1), NDC80 kinetochore complex component NUF2 (NUF2), NDC80 kinetochore complex component SPC24 (SPC24), and SPC25, plays a critical role in kinetochore–microtubule attachment. Mounting evidence indicates that phosphorylation of HEC1 is important for regulating the binding of the NDC80 complex to microtubules. However, it remains unclear whether other post-translational modifications, such as acetylation, regulate NDC80–microtubule attachment during mitosis. Here, using pulldown assays with HeLa cell lysates and site-directed mutagenesis, we show that HEC1 is a bona fide substrate of the lysine acetyltransferase Tat-interacting protein, 60 kDa (TIP60) and that TIP60-mediated acetylation of HEC1 is essential for accurate chromosome segregation in mitosis. We demonstrate that TIP60 regulates the dynamic interactions between NDC80 and spindle microtubules during mitosis and observed that TIP60 acetylates HEC1 at two evolutionarily conserved residues, Lys-53 and Lys-59. Importantly, this acetylation weakened the phosphorylation of the N-terminal HEC1(1–80) region at Ser-55 and Ser-62, which is governed by Aurora B and regulates NDC80–microtubule dynamics, indicating functional cross-talk between these two post-translation modifications of HEC1. Moreover, the TIP60-mediated acetylation was specifically reversed by sirtuin 1 (SIRT1). Taken together, our results define a conserved signaling hierarchy, involving HEC1, TIP60, Aurora B, and SIRT1, that integrates dynamic HEC1 acetylation and phosphorylation for accurate kinetochore–microtubule attachment in the maintenance of genomic stability during mitosis."
https://openalex.org/W2900093962,"Background The liver-derived plasma protein fetuin-A is strongly expressed during fetal life, hence its name. Fetuin-A protein is normally present in most fetal organs and tissues, including brain tissue. Fetuin-A was neuroprotective in animal models of cerebral ischemia and lethal chronic inflammation, suggesting a role beyond the neonatal period. Little is known, however, on the presence of fetuin-A in mature human brain tissue under different physiological and pathological conditions. Methods We studied by immunohistochemistry (IHC) the distribution of fetuin-A protein in mature human brain autopsy tissues from patients without neurological disease, patients with inflammatory brain disorders, and patients with ischemic brain lesions. To identify fetuin-A-positive cells in these tissues we co-localized fetuin-A with GFAP (astrocytes) and CD68 (macrophages, activated microglia). Results and discussion Unlike previous reports, we detected fetuin-A protein also in mature human brain as would be expected from an abundant plasma protein also present in cerebrospinal fluid. Fetuin-A immunoreactivity was increased in ischemic white matter and decreased in inflamed cerebellar tissue. Fetuin-A immunostaining was predominantly associated with neurons and astrocytes. Unlike the developing brain, the adult brain lacked fetuin-A immunostaining in CD68-positive microglia. Our findings suggest a role for fetuin-A in tissue remodeling of neonatal brain, which becomes obsolete in the adult brain, but is re-activated in damaged brain tissue. To further assess the role of fetuin-A in the mature brain, animal models involving ischemia and inflammation need to be studied."

Levels of aromatase, the rate-limiting enzyme in estrogen biosynthesis, are increased in the breast tissue of obese women. Both prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) contribute to the induction of aromatase in adipose stromal cells (ASCs). Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) binds, deacetylates, and thereby inactivates HIF-1α. Here, we sought to determine whether SIRT1 also plays a role in regulating aromatase expression. We demonstrate that reduced SIRT1 levels are associated with elevated levels of acetyl–HIF-1α, HIF-1α, and aromatase in breast tissue of obese compared with lean women. To determine whether these changes were functionally linked, ASCs were utilized. In ASCs, treatment with PGE2, which is increased in obese individuals, down-regulated SIRT1 levels, leading to elevated acetyl–HIF-1α and HIF-1α levels and enhanced aromatase gene transcription. Chemical SIRT1 activators (SIRT1720 and resveratrol) suppressed the PGE2-mediated induction of acetyl–HIF-1α, HIF-1α, and aromatase. Silencing of p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF), which acetylates HIF-1α, blocked PGE2-mediated increases in acetyl–HIF-1α, HIF-1α, and aromatase. SIRT1 overexpression or PCAF silencing inhibited the interaction between HIF-1α and p300, a coactivator of aromatase expression, and suppressed p300 binding to the aromatase promoter. PGE2 acted via prostaglandin E2 receptor 2 (EP2) and EP4 to induce activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3), a repressive transcription factor, which bound to a CREB site within the SIRT1 promoter and reduced SIRT1 levels.

Based on this structure, it has been suggested that Na+ binding to Asp-164 releases the first H+ of the two exchanged against Na+. The second proton was proposed to originate from the protonated Lys-300 in the Asp-163/Lys-300 salt bridge in a “salt bridge mechanism” of transport (14Cǎlinescu O. Dwivedi M. Patiño-Ruiz M. Padan E.

In addition, the Lys-300 mutants investigated so far showed significantly reduced structural stability (14Cǎlinescu O. Dwivedi M. Patiño-Ruiz M. Padan E. Fendler K. Lysine 300 is essential for stability but not for electrogenic transport of the Escherichia coli NhaA Na+/H+ antiporter.J. Biol.

Recent mechanistic and structural analysis of a related electrogenic Na+/H+ antiporter, NapA from Thermus thermophilus (TtNapA), supports the critical functional role of the homologous lysine residue Lys-305 that forms a salt bridge with one of the Na+-binding aspartates, Asp-156, and possibly also serves as a proton donor in the salt bridge mechanism. Replacement of Lys-305 by a neutral alanine, polar glutamine, or by a permanently positively charged arginine showed an apparently electroneutral phenotype indicating that only a single H+ of Asp-157 is exchanged for one Na+ (19Uzdavinys P. Coinçon M. Nji E. Ndi M. Winkelmann I. von Ballmoos C. Drew D. Dissecting the proton transport pathway in electrogenic Na+/H+ antiporters.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2017; 114 (28154142): E1101-E111010.1073/pnas.1614521114Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In addition, the mutation K305Q rescued the nonfunctional D156N mutant implying that an unpaired positive charge in position 305 is lethal for NapA function. Because the electroneutrality of the TtNapA K305 variants is a central point of the argument in favor of the salt bridge mechanism, we have performed an analysis of the analogous mutations in EcNhaA, namely of K300Q EcNhaA and D163N/K300Q EcNhaA by direct electrophysiological experiments. This was combined with H+ transport measurements and thermal stability analysis. Finally, to rule out the possibility of a significantly different transport mechanism in TtNapA compared with EcNhaA, we performed a comparative electrophysiological analysis of TtNapA and the corresponding K305Q and D156N/K305Q variants. To evaluate the growth phenotype of EcNhaA K300Q under conditions of high-salt concentrations, a salt-sensitive strain of E. coli (EP432) that lacks the Na+/H+ antiporters NhaA and NhaB was employed (20Pinner E. Kotler Y. Padan E. Schuldiner S. Physiological role of NhaB, a specific Na+/H+ antiporter in Escherichia coli.J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268 (8093613): 1729-1734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Only the cells transformed with a functional antiporter able to export Na+ grow in selective media (0.6 m NaCl at pH 7/pH 8.2 or 0.1 m LiCl at pH 7.0). As expected, the cells transformed with the WT variant grew well under any of the three tested conditions (Fig. 2a). Bacteria transformed with the mutant K300Q grew similarly to the WT at pH 7, with a moderate reduction in growth when Na+ was replaced by Li+. However, growth was decreased by 3 orders of magnitude under high-Na+ conditions at pH 8.2 (Fig. 2a). Besides replacement of Lys-300 by Gln, its partner in the salt bridge, Asp-163, was exchanged by Asn. This additional mutation did not further affect the salt-resistance phenotype observed for the single mutant K300Q (Fig. 2a). A preliminary characterization of the transport activity mediated by the EcNhaA K300Q and D163N/K300Q mutants was performed using fluorescence-dequenching assays in inside-out (or everted) membrane vesicles isolated from EP432 cells expressing those variants. For comparison, protein expression was quantified in the mutants relative to the WT: 40% in K300Q and 36% for D163N/K300Q EcNhaA. Expression in D163N EcNhaA was 23% (17Olkhova E. Kozachkov L. Padan E. Michel H. Combined computational and biochemical study reveals the importance of electrostatic interactions between the “pH sensor” and the cation binding site of the sodium/proton antiporter NhaA of Escherichia coli.Proteins. 2009; 76 (19274728): 548-55910.1002/prot.22368Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The fluorescent dye acridine orange was used as a probe of the transmembrane H+ gradient. Energization of the E. coli respiratory chain with Tris/d-lactate causing acidification of the vesicles is observed as quenching of the fluorescence (21Rosen B.P. Ion extrusion systems in Escherichia coli.Methods Enzymol. 1986; 125 (2423844): 328-33610.1016/S0076-6879(86)25028-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). If the membrane contains a functional Na+/H+-exchanger, addition of Na+ or Li+ to the outside of the vesicles triggers Na+(Li+)/H+ antiport, which is observed as fluorescence dequenching (22Schuldiner S. Fishkes H. Sodium-proton antiport in isolated membrane vesicles of Escherichia coli.Biochemistry. 1978; 17 (23828): 706-71110.1021/bi00597a023Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Insertion of the single mutation K300Q reduced the Na+/H+ antiport activity to ∼40% of the WT at pH 8.5 (Fig. 2, c and d). However, considering that expression of the mutant was only ∼1/3 of WT, we have to conclude that in this assay the K300Q EcNhaA variant was as active as the WT. The same effect was observed for the double mutant D163N/K300Q. Once it was established that both variants were active, their substrate affinities were determined. It was found that both mutations remarkably affected the Li+ Km (KmLi+). The Km values for K300Q (1.1 ± 0.3 mm) and D163N/K300Q (0.5 ± 0.1 mm) (Fig. 2b) are 55- and 25-fold higher, respectively, than the value reported for the WT (0.02 mm) (14Cǎlinescu O. Dwivedi M. Patiño-Ruiz M. Padan E. Fendler K. Lysine 300 is essential for stability but not for electrogenic transport of the Escherichia coli NhaA Na+/H+ antiporter.J. Biol.

Na+- and Li+-induced dequenching appeared to be relatively pH-independent for all the tested variants, except EcNhaA WT at Na+ 10 mm, which evidenced a reduction of 50% at pH 7.0, while remaining constant over the rest of the tested pH range (7.5–9.0) (Fig. 2, c and d). To characterize the protein transport function, the EcNhaA variants K300Q and D163N/K300Q, were expressed in E. coli, detergent-solubilized, purified, and reconstituted in liposomes. Electrogenicity as well as the kinetic parameters for the protein function were determined by SSM electrophysiology (23Schulz P. Garcia-Celma J.J. Fendler K. SSM-based electrophysiology.Methods. 2008; 46 (18675360): 97-10310.1016/j.ymeth.2008.07.002Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), whereas the H+ transport activity was evaluated by dequenching of acridine orange fluorescence in proteoliposomes using pH gradient generated by NH4+. SSM-based electrophysiological measurements on proteoliposomes of electrogenic CPA2 Na+/H+ antiporters are characterized by negative transient currents upon Na+(Li+) concentration jumps indicating that a net outward positive charge transfer takes place during the transport cycle (24Mager T.

In this study, all recorded signals represented steady-state charge transfer according to previously published criteria (14Cǎlinescu O. Dwivedi M. Patiño-Ruiz M. Padan E. Fendler K. Lysine 300 is essential for stability but not for electrogenic transport of the Escherichia coli NhaA Na+/H+ antiporter.J. Biol.

Replacing Lys-300 in EcNhaA by a polar Gln residue did not abolish the negative currents obtained for the WT, but showed robust electrogenic transport. However, the single mutation reduced by 40-fold the magnitude of the peak current compared with the values typically observed for the WT variant under the same conditions (Fig. 3, a and b). An even more drastic reduction was observed for the peak current of the D163N/K300Q variant (120 fold) (Fig. 3b). Nevertheless, the persistence of a negative current is a clear indication that even when those two charged residues located in the ion-binding site are replaced by a neutral amino acid the transport activity is still electrogenic. In addition, it was observed that both mutants invariably showed substantial rundown of the electrical signals over a period of 1–2 h, a property that correlates with a tendency to aggregate the solubilized enzymes (13Maes M. Rimon A. Kozachkov-Magrisso L. Friedler A. Padan E. Revealing the ligand binding site of NhaA Na+ /H+ antiporter and its pH dependence.J. Biol.

A full characterization of the signal obtained for the EcNhaA K300Q mutant with respect to its Na+ concentration and pH dependence (Table 1 and Fig. 3, c and d) confirmed that the reduction in current magnitude is not associated with changes in pH profile or Na+ affinity. The currents of the double mutant D163N/K300Q EcNhaA were too small, and the signals too unstable for a detailed characterization.Table 1Comparison of Electrophysiology, H+ transport activity, and thermal stability results for EcNhaA variantsEcNhaA WTEcNhaA K300QEcNhaA D163N/K300QEcNhaA D163NImax12 ± 2 nA0.30 ± 0.06 nA0.10 ± 0.04 nANDKmNa+11 ± 1 mm (pH 8.5)aData were taken from Ref. 24.18.4 ± 3.9 mm (pH 8.5)NDNDKmLi+7.3 mm (pH 8.0)bData were taken from Ref. 27.NDNDNDpHoptNa+8.8aData were taken from Ref. 24.8.6NDNDDequenching (liposomes)+++ (50 mm Li+)+ (50 mm Li+)− (50 mm Li+)NDStability (DSF)+−−NDTm (CD)74.7 ± 0.1 °C62.0 ± 0.1 °C63.0 ± 0.1 °C67.0 ± 0.1 °Ca Data were taken from Ref. 24Mager T.

Open table in a new tab To test the correlation between the electrophysiological results and the H+ transport activity for both EcNhaA variants, acridine orange fluorescence–dequenching measurements were carried out in proteoliposomes. In contrast to the assay in inside-out membrane vesicles, the H+ gradient was generated by loading the proteoliposomes with NH4Cl. Once the proteoliposomes were diluted in NH4+-free solution, NH3 diffuses out, leaving the intra-liposomal compartment acidified. This acidification is observed as a quenching in the fluorescence (Fig. 3e). The instability of the established H+ gradient is evidenced by a subsequent slow increment in the fluorescence. If an active Na+/H+-exchanger exists in the membrane, dequenching can be induced by addition of Na+ (or Li+) to the outside of the liposomes, initiating the Na+(Li+)/H+ antiport. As observed in Fig. 3e, the WT EcNhaA variant showed robust dequenching (≈90%) following Li+ addition. In contrast, a remarkably reduced Li+/H+ antiport activity was recorded in EcNhaA K300Q proteoliposomes, which agrees with the decreased peak current observed for the same mutant in SSM. In contrast, no dequenching was observed for the D163N/K300Q variant (Fig. 3e). This might be an indication of the limitation of this assay on detecting such a small activity corresponding to the dramatically reduced current recorded for the double mutant. The dequenching assay is difficult to quantify due to inherent problems of the assay like the limited dynamic range (25Cǎlinescu O. Danner E. Böhm M. Hunte C. Fendler K. Species differences in bacterial NhaA Na+/H+ exchangers.FEBS Lett. 2014; 588 (25017436): 3111-311610.1016/j.febslet.2014.05.066Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and poorly controlled internal pH. But the overall low H+ transport activity of the K300Q and D163N/K300Q mutants, as determined in the dequenching assay, correlates with a corresponding low electrogenic activity as assessed electrophysiologically. To establish whether the single and double mutations affected the stability of EcNhaA, two different techniques were employed: differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) and circular dichroism (CD). Both techniques detect thermal unfolding at rising temperatures of the detergent-solubilized protein. DSF follows the fluorescence emission intensity of the protein's tryptophan and tyrosine residues. If these residues are exposed to a hydrophilic environment as a consequence of temperature-induced structural destabilization, their quantum yield decreases leading to changes in fluorescence wavelength and intensity (28Weichel M. Bassarab S. Garidel P. Probing thermal stability of mAbs by intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence.Bioprocess Int. 2008; 6: 42-52Google Scholar). To account for these changes, the ratio between the emission intensities at 350 and 330 nm (F350/330) is plotted against the temperature (Fig. 4a). In CD, protein unfolding events can be detected by monitoring ellipticity, which is correlated to the α-helical content of a protein. When a protein unfolds as a result of heating, these highly-ordered secondary structures are lost, which is observed by an intensity change in the CD bands (Fig. 4b) (29Greenfield N.J. Using circular dichroism collected as a function of temperature to determine the thermodynamics of protein unfolding and binding interactions.Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1 (17406506): 2527-253510.1038/nprot.2006.204Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). The resulting temperature-dependent intensity traces in DSF and CD are known as melting curves. As reported previously, EcNhaA WT showed a DSF melting curve characterized by a clearly pronounced inflection point at 65.9 °C (Fig. 4a) (14Cǎlinescu O. Dwivedi M. Patiño-Ruiz M. Padan E. Fendler K.

In contrast, the presence of the relatively flat curves obtained for the EcNhaA K300Q and D163N/K300Q variants without a clear melting transition suggests that those mutations impair the structural stability of EcNhaA (Fig. 4a) (14Cǎlinescu O.

This was confirmed by CD (Fig. 4c) in which the protein unfolding occurred at 62.0 ± 0.1 and 63.0 ± 0.1 °C for K300Q and D163N/K300Q, respectively, almost 10 °C lower than the transition temperature Tm obtained for the WT at pH 4 (74.7 ± 0.1 °C) (Fig. 4c and Table 1). Thermal stability was also determined for the single mutant D163N using CD spectroscopy. As observed in Fig. 4c, this mutation presented a melting curve with an intermediate Tm (67 ± 0.1 °C) indicating that mutation of Lys-300 affects the stability of EcNhaA more profoundly than that of Asp-16"
https://openalex.org/W2899818019,"The cerebellar ataxia, areflexia, pes cavus, optic atrophy, and sensorineural hearing loss (CAPOS) syndrome is caused by the single mutation E818K of the α3-isoform of Na+,K+-ATPase. Here, using biochemical and electrophysiological approaches, we examined the functional characteristics of E818K, as well as of E818Q and E818A mutants. We found that these amino acid substitutions reduce the apparent Na+ affinity at the cytoplasmic-facing sites of the pump protein and that this effect is more pronounced for the lysine and glutamine substitutions (3-4-fold) than for the alanine substitution. The electrophysiological measurements indicated a more conspicuous, ∼30-fold reduction of apparent Na+ affinity for the extracellular-facing sites in the CAPOS mutant, which was related to an accelerated transition between the phosphoenzyme intermediates E1P and E2P. The apparent affinity for K+ activation of the ATPase activity was unaffected by these substitutions, suggesting that primarily the Na+-specific site III is affected. Furthermore, the apparent affinities for ATP and vanadate were WT-like in E818K, indicating a normal E1-E2 equilibrium of the dephosphoenzyme. Proton-leak currents were not increased in E818K. However, the CAPOS mutation caused a weaker voltage dependence of the pumping rate and a stronger inhibition by cytoplasmic K+ than the WT enzyme, which together with the reduced Na+ affinity of the cytoplasmic-facing sites precluded proper pump activation under physiological conditions. The functional deficiencies could be traced to the participation of Glu-818 in an intricate hydrogen-bonding/salt-bridge network, connecting it to key residues involved in Na+ interaction at site III."

Insecticides that are effective to this pest and selective to predator stinkbugs are required for the integrated management of S. exigua.The toxicity of four commercial insecticide formulations azadirachtin + pyrethrin, spinosad, pyrethrin and chlorantraniliprole was tested on the target pest and their side effect were evaluated on the spined soldier bug, Podisus maculiventris (Heteroptera: Pentatomidae) through different bioassays.Spinosad and chlorantraniliprole were more toxic to S. exigua than to the predator P. maculiventris but opposite results were obtained for pyrethrin and azadirachtin + pyrethrin in contact toxicity bioassay. Chlorantraniliprole was the most toxic to S. exigua in oral toxicity bioassay, followed by spinosad, pyrethrin and azadirachtin + pyrethrin. Spinosad in oral toxicity bioassay was the most toxic to P. maculiventris, followed by pyrethrin, azadirachtin + pyrethrin and chlorantraniliprole. Spinosad caused irritability to the predator while pyrethrin to the pest. The insecticide repellency was not observed over the tested insect species. The synthetic insecticide chlorantraniliprole was less toxic than the natural pyrethrin, azadirachtin + pyrethrin and spinosad to the predator.This work provides useful information on the combination of commercial insecticides with the predator P. maculiventris to controlling S. exigua in integrated pest management (IPM) programs."

Ribosomes account for a large portion of cell mass, and their synthesis can be highly energy-consuming. It is estimated that in rapidly growing Escherichia coli, around 90% of the energy consumption is for protein synthesis, and a significant amount is used for generating ribosomes (1Neidhardt F.C. Ingraham J.L. Schaechter M. Physiology of the Bacterial Cell: A Molecular Approach. Sinauer Associates Inc., Sunderland, MA1990: 520Google Scholar). The complete 70S bacterial ribosome is composed of the 30S small subunit and the 50S large subunit. In general, the 30S small subunit consists of the 16S rRNA and 21 ribosomal proteins (S1–S21); the 50S large subunit consists of the 23S and 5S rRNAs and 36 ribosomal proteins (L1–L36). Although active ribosomes can be reconstituted in vitro using individually purified ribosomal proteins and rRNAs, the process occurs at a much slower rate and requires harsher conditions (2Nierhaus K.H. Dohme F. Total reconstitution of functionally active 50S ribosomal subunits from Escherichia coli.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1974; 71 (4612527): 4713-471710.1073/pnas.71.12.4713Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). By contrast, in vivo ribosomal biogenesis is assisted by various ribosomal cofactors, including helicase, chaperones, maturation factors, and GTPase, and hence needs a lower activation energy and produces fewer intermediates (3Champney W.S. Kinetics of ribosome synthesis during a nutritional shift-up in Escherichia coli K-12.MGG Mol. Gen. Genet. 1977; 152 (327281): 259-26610.1007/BF00693079Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The ribosomal maturation factor P (RimP), also known as yhbC, is a highly conserved ribosomal cofactor in both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria (Fig. S1, A–C). Null mutation of RimP in E. coli shows slower growth than WT at high temperatures (4Nord S. Bylund G.O. Lövgren J.M. Wikström P.M. The RimP protein is important for maturation of the 30S ribosomal subunit.J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 386 (19150615): 742-75310.1016/j.jmb.2008.12.076Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In the food-borne pathogen Salmonella enteritidis, the RimP mutant shows decreased growth rate and becomes more sensitive to both reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates but less virulent in vitro (5Chang J. Pang E. He H. Kwang J. Identification of novel attenuated Salmonella enteritidis mutants.FEMS Immunol. Med. Microbiol. 2008; 53 (18355292): 26-3410.1111/j.1574-695X.2008.00394.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In the Gram-positive pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae, the null mutant is lethal (6Yu L. Gunasekera A.H. Mack J. Olejniczak E.T. Chovan L.E. Ruan X. Towne D.L. Lerner C.G. Fesik S.W. Solution structure and function of a conserved protein SP14.3 encoded by an essential Streptococcus pneumoniae gene.J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311 (11493012): 593-60410.1006/jmbi.2001.4894Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Overall, these phenotypic studies highlight the physiological importance of RimP in bacteria. Several mechanistic studies have showed the functional association of RimP with ribosomal biogenesis. Wikström and co-workers (4Nord S. Bylund G.O. Lövgren J.M. Wikström P.M. The RimP protein is important for maturation of the 30S ribosomal subunit.J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 386 (19150615): 742-75310.1016/j.jmb.2008.12.076Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) found that the RimP null mutant reduced the levels of polysome and mature 70S, whereas it increased the amounts of 30S and 50S in E. coli. Moreover, less accumulation of 30S than 50S was observed in polysome profiling (4Nord S. Bylund G.O. Lövgren J.M. Wikström P.M. The RimP protein is important for maturation of the 30S ribosomal subunit.J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 386 (19150615): 742-75310.1016/j.jmb.2008.12.076Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In their study, RimP was only found in the fractions of 30S subunit but not others in sucrose gradient centrifugation, and primer extension studies demonstrated that RimP knockout bacteria up-regulated the level of pre-16S rRNA but down-regulated mature 16S rRNA levels (4Nord S. Bylund G.O. Lövgren J.M. Wikström P.M. The RimP protein is important for maturation of the 30S ribosomal subunit.J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 386 (19150615): 742-75310.1016/j.jmb.2008.12.076Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Recently, quantitative MS studies on E. coli suggested that RimP can increase the binding kinetics of the S5 and S12 ribosomal proteins to the 5′ domain of rRNA in vitro (7Bunner A.E. Nord S. Wikström P.M. Williamson J.R. The effect of ribosome assembly cofactors on in vitro 30S subunit reconstitution.J. Mol. Biol. 2010; 398 (20188109): 1-710.1016/j.jmb.2010.02.036Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In addition, it was reported that the relative timing of the assembly of the 3′ domain and the formation of the central pseudoknot structure in the 16S rRNA depend on the presence of the assembly factor RimP (8Sashital D.G. Greeman C.A. Lyumkis D. Potter C.S. Carragher B. Williamson J.R. A combined quantitative mass spectrometry and electron microscopy analysis of ribosomal 30S subunit assembly in E. coli.Elife. 2014; 3 (10.7554/eLife.04491, 25313868)10.7554/eLife.04491Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These in vivo and in vitro data indicate that RimP is essential for the biogenesis of the 30S small subunit in E. coli. Despite extensive biochemical and biophysical study, the mechanism of RimP in ribosomal biogenesis is still not fully understood. The only available structure to date is the solution structure of SP14.3, an ortholog in S. pneumoniae, solved using NMR. It consists of a highly negatively charged N-terminal domain and a slightly positively charged C-terminal domain resembling the Sm fold (6Yu L. Gunasekera A.H. Mack J. Olejniczak E.T. Chovan L.E. Ruan X. Towne D.L. Lerner C.G. Fesik S.W. Solution structure and function of a conserved protein SP14.3 encoded by an essential Streptococcus pneumoniae gene.J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311 (11493012): 593-60410.1006/jmbi.2001.4894Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Because of the flexible linker between the two domains, their relative orientation is not defined. The structure, however, is limited in clarifying its mechanism in ribosomal biogenesis. Mycobacterium tuberculosis is the causative agent of tuberculosis, which killed 1.7 million people in 2016 (9World Health OrganizationWHO Global Tuberculosis Report 2016. World Health Organization, Geneva2016Google Scholar). Active M. tuberculosis infection leads to severe pulmonary and occasionally extrapulmonary symptoms, particularly in immunocompromised patients, such as those with HIV. Moreover, the emergence of multidrug-resistant strains confounds effective treatment, which typically involves prolonged use of multiple antibiotics. Therefore, the discovery of a druggable target in M. tuberculosis is of importance in future drug development. Here, we describe the crystal structure of RimP homolog MSMEG_2624 in Mycobacterium smegmatis, a model organism for studying M. tuberculosis. We demonstrate that the linker region of MSMEG_2624 plays an important physiological role in interacting with RpsL, the small ribosomal protein S12, thereby affecting ribosomal biogenesis. Because RimP is a highly conserved mycobacterial protein, the understanding of its mechanism will provide insight in studying ribosomal biogenesis and developing new drugs to target M. tuberculosis. MSMEG_2624 was purified as a monomer in solution (data not shown). The crystal structure of MSMEG_2624 was solved by single isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering (SIRAS) phasing, and the final model was refined to 2.2 Å (Fig. 1A). Detailed statistics of data processing, phasing, structure refinement, and Ramachandran plot are shown in Table 1 and Fig. S2. Both N-terminal (aa 4The abbreviations used are:aaamino acidsNCSnoncrystallographic symmetryAGCautomatic gain control. 1–93) and C-terminal (aa 94–181) domains of MSMEG_2624 are similar to that of SP14.3, with 2.1 and 2.8 Å Cα root mean square deviation, respectively. The C-terminal domains of MSMEG_2624 and SP14.3 resemble the Sm fold, which is composed of six β sheets. The electron density of the loop between α2 and β3 is missing, which indicates a disordered structure (Fig. S3). The major difference between MSMEG_2624 and SP14.3, however, lies in the additional α-helix (α2′), connected by the long loop to the last β sheet β6′ (aa 158–165) on the C terminus of MSMEG_2624, which forms the handle of the barrel-like Sm fold (Fig. 1, B and C).Table 1Crystal data processing, phasing and structure refinement statisticsView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab amino acids noncrystallographic symmetry automatic gain control. Despite the high resemblance between the crystal structure of MSMEG_2624 and the solution structure of SP14.3 at the individual domain level, they differ in the interdomain orientation. Whereas the solution structure of SP14.3 did not reveal a rigid orientation from the NOE data, our crystal structure of MSMEG_2624 shows strong electron density around the interdomain linker, indicating a well-defined clamplike orientation in the crystal (Fig. 1D). Under this orientation, the handle-like structure from the C-terminal domain interacts with the N-terminal domain through 1) hydrophobic interaction between the side chains of Phe-161 and Val-50 and 2) the hydrogen bond network formed among the Ser-162, Asp-35, and Val-36 (Fig. 1, E and F). These interactions are absent in the structure of SP14.3 and might be involved in the stabilization of the interdomain orientation, resulting in a more rigid structure. It is unclear whether the interdomain orientation is also present in solution, as we observed that both domains of MSMEG_2624 participated in crystal contact with the neighboring molecule (Fig. S4), which is expected for a protein that consists of only two domains. To study the function of each domain of MSEMG_2624 in ribosome biogenesis, we first tested their interaction with binding partners. In previous interaction network studies of E. coli and Helicobacter pylori, RimP was reported to interact with S5, S7, and S12 of the small ribosomal subunit (10Kerrien S. Aranda B. Breuza L. Bridge A. Broackes-Carter F. Chen C. Duesbury M. Dumousseau M. Feuermann M. Hinz U. Jandrasits C. Jimenez R.C. Khadake J. Mahadevan U. Masson P. et al.The IntAct molecular interaction database in 2012.Nucleic Acids Res. 2012; 40 (22121220): D841-D84610.1093/nar/gkr1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). In M. smegmatis, we detected the interaction between MSMEG_2624 and RpsL (S12) by co-immunoprecipitation followed by tandem MS (Fig. S5) and further validated it using a tandem affinity purification assay with recombinant proteins (Fig. 2A). We found that neither the C- nor the N-terminal domain of MSMEG_2624 alone is sufficient to bind RpsL (Fig. 2, B and C), which suggested that the two domains of MSEMG_2624 cooperatively interact with RpsL. In addition, the first 25 residues of RpsL were dispensable for the binding to MSMEG_2624 (Fig. S6). We hypothesized that the linker region was essential for the coordination between the two domains of MSMEG_2624 to bind RpsL (Fig. 3A). To test this hypothesis, we mutated residues in this region and tested their effects on binding with RpsL. The charged residues, Asp-93 and Arg-94, were either deleted or reversed/neutralized; residues with more (Pro-95) or less (Gly-91) restricted torsion angles were swapped (Fig. 3A and Fig. S7). As shown in Fig. 3B, both linker deletion mutants significantly reduced the binding efficiency to RpsL, suggesting the importance of the linker region. The swapping of glycine to proline at position 91 but not 95 abolished the binding. We speculate that this distinct effect might be explained by the fact that G91P mutant disrupted the interdomain orientation by steric hindrance, whereas P95G merely increased the flexibility of the backbone. Alternatively, the residue Gly-91 might directly interact with RpsL. For mutations on the charged residues, R94D/A but not D93R/A greatly reduced the strength of the binding. In addition, we noticed that R94D showed a much stronger effect than R94A, suggesting that the positive charge of Arg-94 might directly participate in binding with RpsL through electrostatic interaction. To test whether the decreased binding efficiency of the mutants was due to protein denaturation or aggregation, we used size-exclusion chromatography to measure their molecular size. We found that all mutants had similar elution profiles as the WT, suggesting their proper folding (Fig. S8). The linker region is significantly enriched for highly conserved residues (p = 0.0005, Fisher exact test), suggesting its functional importance. Strikingly, we observed that all mutants that affected conserved residues showed a decrease in binding efficiency with RpsL, which suggested that these sites were under purifying selections. Taken together, we demonstrated that the linker of MSMEG_2624 was essential in coordinating the two domains to bind with RpsL. Although previous literature suggested that RimP was involved in the maturation of the 30S ribosome by stabilizing the pseudoknot structure and facilitating the incorporation of late binder ribosomal proteins, a detailed mechanism is still lacking. Having shown the importance of interdomain linker of MSMEG_2624 in binding RpsL, we analyzed the functions of RimP in ribosomal biogenesis in terms of its interaction with RpsL. Similarly to RimP in E. coli, MSMEG_2624 knockout in M. smegmatis showed reduction in polysomes and 70S ribosomes and concomitantly increased free 30S and 50S ribosomal subunits (Fig. 4A). The phenotype can be rescued by complementation of RimP in the knockout strain (Fig. 4A). In addition, we confirmed using MS that MSMEG_2624 was essential for the efficient recruitment of RpsL to the maturing 30S subunit (Fig. 4B). To specifically characterize the in vivo effects of the linker region of MSMEG_2624 on ribosomal biogenesis, we analyzed the ribosomal profile of the MSMEG_2624 knockout strains of M. smegmatis, complemented by two MSMEG_2624 mutants. We compared one that significantly abolished the interaction with RpsL (ΔP90–D93), with another that did not (P95G). The knockout strain complemented by the ΔP90–D93 mutant showed a significantly lower level of 70S ribosome than that complemented by P95G, suggesting that the interdomain linker of MSMEG_2624 is essential for ribosome biogenesis via its interaction with RpsL (Fig. 4C). Taken together, we propose a model of ribosomal biogenesis in which the two domains of RimP cooperatively bind with S12 through the linker region, whereby it facilities efficient maturation of the complete 70S ribosome. In this study, we have reported a high-resolution crystal structure of RimP homolog in M. smegmatis that revealed a well-defined interdomain orientation. Moreover, we have provided a mechanistic view of RimP in ribosomal biogenesis. Our binding assays demonstrate that the two domains of RimP cooperatively bind with the small ribosomal protein RpsL through its linker region. More importantly, this linker region is essential for ribosomal biogenesis. Sashital et al. (8Sashital D.G. Greeman C.A. Lyumkis D. Potter C.S. Carragher B. Williamson J.R. A combined quantitative mass spectrometry and electron microscopy analysis of ribosomal 30S subunit assembly in E. coli.Elife. 2014; 3 (10.7554/eLife.04491, 25313868)10.7554/eLife.04491Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) reported that in the absence of RimP, the central pseudoknot structure of rRNA was unstable, resulting in the accumulation of intermediates. These intermediate products were depleted of S5 and S12, which are both pseudoknot-interacting ribosomal proteins. We propose that the linker region of RimP forms a platform for recruiting S12 and facilitating the rRNA binding. Indeed, this hypothesis could explain the functional importance of the evolutionarily conserved residues in this linker region. In the structure of MSMEG_2624 and SP14.3, the C-terminal domain has an Sm fold that is also observed in Hfq, an RNA chaperone that mediates the interaction between sRNAs and their mRNA targets. Hfq is a hexamer that efficiently binds RNA, whereas RimP remains as a monomer in solution and does not appear to show RNA-binding activity. Indeed, the amino acid sequence between Hfq and RimP diverges significantly. This observation indicates that Hfq and the C-terminal domain of RimP are functionally divergent, even though they are structurally similar. RimP is highly conserved in prokaryotes, and its functional importance in ribosomal biogenesis has been reported in multiple bacterial species. As no homolog protein has been identified in mammals, it has the potential of becoming a drug target for therapeutic purposes to combat bacterial infections, such as tuberculosis. This makes our structure and biochemical study of particular importance for future drug design. The bacterial strains and vectors used in this work are summarized in Table S1. Recombinant His-tagged MSMEG_2624 was expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells, and purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography. The His tag was cleaved, and the protein was further purified by size-exclusion chromatography (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 250 mm NaCl). MSMEG_2624 crystals were grown under 20% PEG 3350, 6% acetonitrile, 0.2 m sodium citrate (pH 8.0) by the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method at 16 °C. The native crystals were cryoprotected by quickly passing through the crystallization buffer containing 12% glycerol before flash freezing. Heavy atom soaking was performed by directly adding 40 mm K2PtCl4 water solution to crystals in the mother liquor twice with a 15-min interval between, to a final concentration of ∼20 mm. The crystals were soaked in the dark overnight and back-soaked for 5 min in cryoprotectant buffer containing 8.8 mm K2PtCl4 and 12% glycerol before data collection. Data sets were processed using the CCP4 suite (11Winn M.D. Ballard C.C. Cowtan K.D. Dodson E.J. Emsley P. Evans P.R. Keegan R.M. Krissinel E.B. Leslie A.G.W. McCoy A. McNicholas S.J. Murshudov G.N.

The structure was deposited to the Protein Data Bank (entry 5GL6). The rimP null mutant strain (ΔrimP) was constructed using homologous recombination to replace the rimP gene with the hygromycin selection marker as described previously (21van Kessel J.C. Hatfull G.F. Recombineering in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Nat. Methods. 2007; 4 (17179933): 147-15210.1038/nmeth996Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Briefly, a DNA substrate for allelic replacement of rimP (MSMEG_2624) was generated by cloning 500-bp upstream and downstream regions of the rimP gene to 5′ and 3′ ends of the hygromycin (hyg) gene, respectively, and transformed into the Msmeg mc2155 strain harboring a pJV53 vector, which can produce recombinase for efficient recombination. The successful knockout strain ΔrimP::hyg was selected and confirmed by sequencing and Western blot analysis. Plasmids pGEX-6P-1-RpsL and pRsfDuet-1-RimP were co-transformed to E. coli BL21(DE3). The bacteria were grown in 3 liters of Luria–Bertani medium at 37 °C until A600 ∼0.6. Protein expression was induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 16 °C overnight. Bacteria were harvested and resuspended in 1× PBS and 0.5% Triton X-100. Bacteria were lysed by sonication, and cell debris and precipitants were removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was mixed with TALON Cobalt beads (Clontech) for 1.5 h at 4 °C followed by 10 column bed volumes of 1× PBS washing. Proteins were then eluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole. The eluted protein was incubated with GSH column (GE Healthcare) for 1.5 h at 4 °C and washed with 10 column bed volumes of 1× PBS. Proteins were eluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, and 10 mm reduced GSH. The strains WT, ΔrimP, ΔrimP+rimP, and ΔrimP+vector were cultured in 7H9 medium, and the cells were harvested at early log phase (A600 ∼1). The cell pellets were lysed as described previously, and the ribosome was extracted according to the method reported previously (22Bylund G.O. Wipemo L.C. Lundberg L.A.C. Wikström P.M. RimM and RbfA are essential for efficient processing of 16S rRNA in Escherichia coli.J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180 (9422595): 73-82Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fraction was precipitated in acetone with a 1:4 ratio at −20 °C overnight. The protein pellet was dissolved in urea buffer (8 m urea in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate). Protein concentration was measured by a Bradford assay. 10 μg of protein were diluted to 1 m urea by 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate and digested overnight at 37 °C using sequencing grade trypsin (Promega) with an enzyme/substrate ratio of 1:50. 5 μg of peptide were desalted by C18 Ziptip (Millipore). The sample pellet was reconstituted in formic acid and injected into MS. The obtained peptides were reconstituted in 12 μl of 0.1% formic acid, and 2 μl was injected into an Easy-nLC 1200 (Thermo). Peptides were separated on a reverse phase C18 column (75-μm inner diameter × 15 cm, 3-μm particle size) and analyzed by an Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo). The mobile phase buffer consisted of 0.1% formic acid in ultrapure water (buffer A) with an eluting buffer of 0.1% formic acid in 80% (v/v) acetonitrile (buffer B) run with a linear 50-min gradient of 7–25% buffer B at a flow rate of 250 nl/min. The mass spectrometer was operated in positive ion mode acquiring a survey mass spectrum with a mass resolution of 120,000, m/z = 350–1800 using an automatic gain control (AGC) target of 3 × 106. The 12 most intense ions were selected for higher-energy collisional dissociation fragmentation (normalized collision energy 27), and MS/MS spectra were generated with an AGC target of 1 × 105 at a resolution of 30,000. The dynamic exclusion time was set to 30 s. The raw data from MS/MS spectra were searched against the M. smegmatis strain mc2 155 (downloaded on August 20, 2018) using the Sequest HT node integrated within the Proteome Discoverer (PD) software (version 2.2, Thermo). The precursor and fragment mass tolerances were set to 10 ppm and 0.02 Da, respectively. A maximum of two missed cleavages was allowed for trypsin digestion. Cysteine carbamidomethylation was set as static modification, whereas methionine oxidation and N-terminal acetylation were set as variable modifications. False discovery rates of peptide spectrum matches and identified peptides were determined using the Percolator algorithm at 1% based on q value. For quantification, the precursor ion areas in a node-based processing and consensus workflow in PD 2.2 were used. The areas of the ions in the MS1 scan were calculated using the Minora Feature alignment and feature mapping. The abundance values of proteins were obtained via a label-free quantification method using LC-MS/MS. T. C. and T. C. K. L. conceptualization; T. C., X. W., C. O. K. L., H.-K. K., J. L., S. L., H. Q.

https://openalex.org/W2899975085,"Lineage specification of the three germ layers occurs during early embryogenesis and is critical for normal development. The nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex is a repressive chromatin modifier that plays a role in lineage commitment. However, the role of chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 4 (CHD4), one of the core subunits of the NuRD complex, in neural lineage commitment is poorly understood. Here, we report that the CHD4/NuRD complex plays a critical role in neural differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). We found that RNAi-mediated Chd4 knockdown suppresses neural differentiation, as did knockdown of methyl-CpG–binding domain protein Mbd3, another NuRD subunit. Chd4 and Mbd3 knockdowns similarly affected changes in global gene expression during neural differentiation and up-regulated several mesendodermal genes. However, inhibition of mesendodermal genes by knocking out the master regulators of mesendodermal lineages, Brachyury and Eomes, through a CRISPR/Cas9 approach could not restore the impaired neural differentiation caused by the Chd4 knockdown, suggesting that CHD4 controls neural differentiation by not repressing other lineage differentiation processes. Notably, Chd4 knockdown increased the acetylation levels of p53, resulting in increased protein levels of p53. Double knockdown of Chd4 and p53 restored the neural differentiation rate. Furthermore, overexpression of BCL2, a downstream factor of p53, partially rescued the impaired neural differentiation caused by the Chd4 knockdown. Our findings reveal that the CHD4/NuRD complex regulates neural differentiation of ESCs by down-regulating p53.

A recent study reported that Chd4 knockdown results in the promotion of endodermal differentiation of ESCs (25Zhao H. Han Z. Liu X. Gu J. Tang F. Wei G. Jin Y. The chromatin remodeler Chd4 maintains embryonic stem cell identity by controlling pluripotency- and differentiation-associated genes.J. Biol.

Caballero I.M. MacLeod R. Nichols J. Wilson V.A. Hendrich B. The NuRD component Mbd3 is required for pluripotency of embryonic stem cells.Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8 (16462733): 285-29210.1038/ncb1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), suggesting that CHD4 functions independently of the NuRD complex in this context. Although the involvement of CHD4 in ESC differentiation has been demonstrated, whether CHD4 regulates the neural lineage commitment of ESCs in a manner dependent on, or independent of, the NuRD complex remains unknown. In this study, we found that the CHD4/NuRD complex plays an important role in neural differentiation of ESCs by regulating the p53 protein level. To study the role of the CHD4/NuRD complex in neural differentiation of mouse ESCs, we performed knockdown experiments. Short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) against Chd4 were introduced into mouse embryonic stem cells (Fig. 1A). For early neural differentiation, we used a serum-free culture of embryoid body-like aggregates with quick reaggregation culture (SFEBq) that allowed highly-efficient neural differentiation (5Kamiya D. Banno S. Sasai N. Ohgushi M. Inomata H. Watanabe K. Kawada M. Yakura R. Kiyonari H. Nakao K. Jakt L.M. Nishikawa S. Sasai Y.

After 4 days of SFEBq culture, embryoid body-like aggregates were dissociated and subjected to adhesion culture for further differentiation into neurons. The protein levels of CHD4 were markedly reduced by each Chd4 shRNA in ESCs (day 0) (Fig. 1B). Chd4 knockdown decreased the number of ESCs, a finding that was consistent with that of a previous report (Fig. 1C) (25Zhao H. Han Z. Liu X. Gu J. Tang F. Wei G. Jin Y. The chromatin remodeler Chd4 maintains embryonic stem cell identity by controlling pluripotency- and differentiation-associated genes.J. Biol.

Next, we examined the gene expression changes before (day 0) and after (day 4) the SFEBq culture. During neural differentiation, the pluripotent marker genes, Oct3/4, Nanog, and Esrrb, were markedly down-regulated in control cells (Fig. 1D). However, Chd4 knockdown did not alter the expression levels of pluripotent marker genes at day 0; Chd4 knockdown suppressed the down-regulation of pluripotent marker genes (Fig. 1D). In addition, Chd4 knockdown strongly suppressed the up-regulation of the early neural marker genes, Sox1, Pax6, and Sox3. Immunostaining also showed that Chd4 knockdown markedly decreased the number of TUJ1-positive neurons at day 7 (Fig. 1E). Next, we examined the effect of Mbd3 knockdown on the neural differentiation rate (Fig. 2A). Mbd3 knockdown also decreased the number of ESCs (Fig. 2B), a finding that was consistent with a previous finding that showed that Mbd3 knockout decreased the number of ESCs (26Kaji K. Caballero I.M. MacLeod R. Nichols J. Wilson V.A. Hendrich B. The NuRD component Mbd3 is required for pluripotency of embryonic stem cells.Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8 (16462733): 285-29210.1038/ncb1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). During neural differentiation, Mbd3 knockdown suppressed the down-regulation of pluripotency marker genes and up-regulation of neural differentiation marker genes (Fig. 2C). Immunostaining also showed that Mbd3 knockdown markedly decreased the number of TUJ1-positive neurons at day 7 (Fig. 2D). These data indicate that the CHD4/NuRD plays a critical role in neural differentiation of ESCs.Figure 1.CHD4 is required for neural differentiation of ESCs. A, scheme for shRNA-mediated Chd4 knockdown and subsequent neural differentiation. ESCs were infected with a lentivirus encoding Chd4 shRNAs (sh Chd4 #1 or #2) or control shRNA (sh Ctrl.) and were cultured under selection with puromycin for 2 days. The SFEBq culture method was used for neural differentiation. SFEBq-cultured cells at day 4 were then subjected to adhesion culture for further neural differentiation. B, immunoblotting analysis for CHD4 and α-tubulin (as a loading control) in control shRNA- and Chd4 shRNA-expressing cells at day 0. C, effect of Chd4 shRNAs on the number of ESCs. One day before viral infection (day −3), 2.5 × 105 cells were plated, and cells were counted at day 0.

We used six samples as follows: control cells at two time points (day 0 and day 4), Chd4-knockdown cells at two time points (day 0 and day 4), and Mbd3-knockdown cells at two time points (day 0 and day 4). First, we analyzed genes with expression levels that were changed upon Chd4 or Mbd3 knockdown in ESCs at day 0. In total, 108 genes and 133 genes were up-regulated in Chd4-knockdown cells and Mbd3-knockdown cells, respectively, compared with control ESCs (Fig. 3A and Table S1). Moreover, 88 genes and 44 genes were down-regulated in Chd4-knockdown cells and Mbd3-knockdown cells, respectively, compared with control ESCs (Fig. 3B and Table S2). However, few genes were commonly regulated by CHD4 and MBD3, indicating that CHD4 and MBD3 might have different functions in ESCs. Several pluripotency-related genes, Foxd3, Zscan4, and Myc, were down-regulated by both Chd4 and Mbd3 knockdown, indicating that these genes may be involved in the decreased number of ESCs caused by Chd4 and Mbd3 knockdown. There were no neural differentiation-related genes among the genes that were commonly regulated by CHD4 and MBD3 in ESCs. Remarkably, however, unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis of gene expression in six samples showed that Chd4-knockdown cells and Mbd3-knockdown cells at day 4 were categorized into the same group, suggesting that CHD4 and MBD3 function in the same complex (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, this analysis showed that both Chd4-knockdown cells at day 4 and Mbd3-knockdown cells at day 4 were close to control cells at day 0 rather than control cells at day 4, suggesting that neither Chd4-knockdown cells nor Mbd3-knockdown cells were fully differentiated into the neural lineage and that both cell types remained in an ESC-like state. Additionally, 1329 genes were up-regulated by more than 2-fold during neural differentiation in control cells (Fig. 4B and Table S3). Among the 1329 genes, we identified 823 genes as CHD4-dependent up-regulated genes and 639 genes as MBD3-dependent up-regulated genes: their expression levels in control cells at day 4 were reduced by more than 50% in both Chd4-knockdown cells and Mbd3-knockdown cells. Remarkably, 614 genes were commonly regulated by CHD4 and MBD3 (Fig. 4B). GO analysis showed that genes related to neural differentiation were enriched in 614 genes. Zfp521, which functions upstream of early neural marker genes (5Kamiya D. Banno S. Sasai N. Ohgushi M. Inomata H. Watanabe K. Kawada M. Yakura R. Kiyonari H. Nakao K. Jakt L.M. Nishikawa S. Sasai Y. Intrinsic transition of embryonic stem-cell differentiation into neural progenitors.Nature. 2011; 470 (21326203): 503-50910.1038/nature09726Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), was included among these 614 genes, suggesting that CHD4 and MBD3 function in the very early stage of neural differentiation. 805 genes were down-regulated by less than half during neural differentiation in control cells (Fig. 4C and Table S4). Among these 805 genes, we identified 512 genes as Chd4-dependent down-regulated genes and 402 genes as Mbd3-dependent down-regulated genes: their expression levels in control cells at day 4 were increased by more than 2-fold in Chd4- and Mbd3-knockdown cells. Remarkably, 371 genes were commonly regulated by CHD4 and MBD3. Many pluripotency marker genes were included in the highly enriched GO terms “regulation of gene expression” and “regulation of stem cell population maintenance” (Fig. 4C). Collectively, our analysis indicated that the CHD4/NuRD complex regulated neural gene induction and stem cell gene suppression during neural differentiation. Because CHD4 represses the transcription of target genes, we focused on the CHD4-dependent down-regulated genes found in our microarray analysis as direct targets of the CHD4/NuRD complex. Notably, Nodal and Bmp4, which play important roles in mesendoderm differentiation of ESCs (27Wilson S.I. Edlund T. Neural induction: toward a unifying mechanism.Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4 (11687825): 1161-116810.1038/nn747Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), were down-regulated during neural differentiation, and their down-regulation was suppressed by Chd4 knockdown, a finding that was also confirmed by qRT-PCR. Furthermore, qRT-PCR analysis showed that the expression levels of Brachyury and Eomes, which are T-box transcription factors important for mesendoderm differentiation (28Faial T. Bernardo A.S.

Recent studies have shown that some repressive chromatin modifiers regulate lineage fidelity during neural differentiation of ESCs by enhancing neural gene expression and suppressing genes specific to other lineages (8Thornton S.R. Butty V.L. Levine S.S. Boyer L.A. Polycomb repressive complex 2 regulates lineage fidelity during embryonic stem cell differentiation.PLoS ONE. 2014; 9 (25333635): e11049810.1371/journal.pone.0110498Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 9Huang C.

Furthermore, a previous report has shown that the CHD4/NuRD complex establishes the identities of the two striated muscle types, cardiac and skeletal muscle, by suppressing the alternate lineage gene program (34Gómez-Del Arco P. Perdiguero E. Yunes-Leites P.S. Acín-Pérez R. Zeini M. Garcia-Gomez A. Sreenivasan K. Jiménez-Alcázar M. Segalés J. López-Maderuelo D. Ornés B. Jiménez-Borreguero L.J. D'Amato G. Enshell-Seijffers D. Morgan B. et al.The chromatin remodeling complex Chd4/NuRD controls striated muscle identity and metabolic homeostasis.Cell Metab. 2016; 23 (27166947): 881-89210.1016/j.cmet.2016.04.008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Therefore, we considered the possibility that the CHD4/NuRD complex may ensure the neural lineage determination of ESCs by inhibiting the mesoderm and endoderm gene programs. To examine this possibility, we investigated whether inhibition of mesendoderm differentiation restored the impaired neural differentiation caused by Chd4 knockdown. To inhibit mesendoderm differentiation, we generated Brachyury-knockout ESCs (Brachyury-KO), Eomes-knockout ESCs (Eomes-KO), and Brachyury/Eomes double knockout (Bra/Eo DKO) ESCs by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene targeting (Fig. 5B). Proper targeting of the Brachuyury and Eomes loci was indicated by PCR genotyping. To examine the differentiation potential of Brachyury and/or Eomes KO ESCs, we induced their differentiation through embryoid body formation. The expression levels of a mesoderm marker, cTnt, and an endoderm marker, Afp, were up-regulated in WT cells, Brachyury-KO cells, and Eomes-KO cells, but they were not expressed in Bra/Eo DKO cells (Fig. 5C). In agreement with the qRT-PCR results, immunostaining showed that cTNT- and AFP-positive cells appeared in cultures of WT cells, Brachyury KO cells, and Eomes KO cells, but not in the culture of Bra/Eo DKO cells (data not shown). Double knockout of Brachyury and Eomes led to complete loss of beating embryoid bodies (Fig. 5D). Thus, we concluded that differentiation to mesoderm and endoderm could be almost completely lost when both Brachyury and Eomes were knocked out. Next, we examined whether the double knockout of Brachyury and Eomes restored the impaired neural differentiation caused by Chd4 knockdown. The obtained results demonstrated that the expression levels of pluripotency markers and neural differentiation markers were not altered by the double knockout of Brachyury and Eomes (Fig. 5E). Although Nodal, Bmp4, Brachyury, and Eomes were up-regulated by Chd4 knockdown, their expression levels might be too low to induce mesendoderm differentiation. Thus, our results suggest that CHD4 controls neural differentiation but not by repressing other lineage differentiation processes. Next, we focused on CHD4-dependent up-regulated genes. Interestingly, up-regulation of Bcl2 was almost completely diminished by Chd4 knockdown (Fig. 6A). BCL2 is known for its negative role in apoptosis and plays an important role in the differentiation of ESCs (35Trouillas M. Saucourt C. Duval D. Gauthereau X. Thibault C. Dembele D. Feraud O. Menager J. Rallu M. Pradier L. Boeuf H.

Previous reports have shown that p53 negatively regulates BCL2 activity by transcription-dependent and -independent mechanisms (36Hemann M.T. Lowe S.W. The p53-Bcl-2 connection.Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13 (16710363): 1256-125910.1038/sj.cdd.4401962Crossref PubMed Scopus"

BCL6 represses TP53 transcription and also appears to inactivate p53 at the protein level, and additional findings have suggested negative mutual regulation between BCL6 and p53. Here, using Bcl6−/− knockout mice, HEK293A and HCT116 p53−/− cells, and site-directed mutagenesis, we found that BCL6 interacts with p53 and thereby inhibits acetylation of Lys-132 in p53 by E1A-binding protein p300 (p300), a modification that normally occurs upon DNA damage–induced cellular stress and whose abrogation by BCL6 diminished transcriptional activation of p53 target genes, including that encoding caspase-1. Conversely, we also found that BCL6 protein is degraded via p53-induced, caspase-mediated proteolytic cleavage, and the formation of a BCL6–p53–caspase-1 complex. Our results suggest that p53 may block oncogenic transformation by decreasing BCL6 stability via caspase-1 up-regulation, whereas aberrant BCL6 expression inactivates transactivation of p53 target genes, either by inhibiting p53 acetylation by p300 or repressing TP53 gene transcription.

BCL6 also represses TP53 by binding to the promoter, allowing GC B cells to circumvent physiological DNA breakage or alteration.

BCL6 expression is restricted to GC B cells in the B cell lineage and is tightly regulated at both the transcriptional and post-translational levels.

Repression of BCL6 is necessary for terminal B cell differentiation. Moreover, transcriptional repressor activity of BCL6 is attenuated by acetylation of its PEST domain by p300, which hinders its complexation with corepressors (11Bereshchenko O.R. Gu W.

Recently, we found that BCL6 interacts with p53 through each other's respective DNA-binding domains. The tumor suppressor p53 is known as the “guardian of the genome” (16Lavin M.F. Gueven N.

To that end, p53 regulates genes involved in apoptosis, cell-cycle arrest, DNA repair, metabolism, and senescence (19Riley T. Sontag E. Chen P. Levine A.

Specifically, genotoxic stresses increase p53 protein stability and transcriptional activity of p53 through post-translational modifications (PTMs), including phosphorylation, ubiquitination, sumoylation, and acetylation (21Sakaguchi K.

Additionally, specific acetylation of p53 plays important roles in stressed cell fate decisions; i.e. specific p53 PTMs are required for transcriptional activation of a group of p53 target genes controlling cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, senescence, differentiation, etc. (23Knights C.D.

Moreover, one of the long-standing unanswered examples is BCL6–p53 due to the peculiarity of absolute negative regulation, i.e. near-complete disappearance of p53 or BCL6 by the presence of BCL6 or p53, respectively. This negative relationship occurs at multiple levels: transcriptional repression of TP53 by BCL6 (6Phan R.T. Dalla-Favera R.

In that regard, BCL6 was shown to attenuate DNA damage responses by affecting p53 pathways, e.g. acting as an inhibitor of antiproliferative ARF–p53 signaling (where ARF stands for alternate reading frame protein) (30Ranuncolo S.M.

Caspases are a family of cysteinyl aspartate–specific proteases that themselves are activated through (often self-) proteolysis of specific asparagine residues. Active caspases specifically cleave various proteins that are implicated in apoptosis and inflammation. During apoptosis, activated “initiator” caspases initiate proteolysis and activate “effector” caspases by cleavage (32Lavrik I.N. Golks A. Krammer P.H. Caspases: pharmacological manipulation of cell death.J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115 (16200200): 2665-267210.1172/JCI26252Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 33Nicholson D.W.

On the contrary, the nonapoptotic caspases, inflammatory caspases-1, -4, -5, -11, -12, and -14, are activated by innate immune responses and inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1β (IL1β) and IL18 (34Scott A.M. Saleh M. The inflammatory caspases: guardians against infections and sepsis.Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14 (16977333): 23-3110.1038/sj.cdd.4402026Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Caspase-1, a well-characterized inflammatory caspase that activates pro-IL1β by proteolytic cleavage in macrophages, also activates the proinflammatory cytokine IL18 (also called interferon-γ–inducing factor) (35Arend W.P. Palmer G. Gabay C. IL-1, IL-18, and IL-33 families of cytokines.Immunol. Rev. 2008; 223 (18613828): 20-3810.1111/j.1600-065X.2008.00624.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Caspase-1 also induces apoptosis when overexpressed in fibroblasts (36Miura M. Zhu H. Rotello R. Hartwieg E.A. Yuan J.

With these considerations, we were particularly intrigued by previous reports showing 1) transcriptional repression of TP53 by BCL6 and 2) immortalization of GC-like B cells in the absence of p53 and opposite regulation of p53 and BCL6 expression/activity by ATM-mediated phosphorylation, Pin1, and p300-mediated acetylation. These reports suggest significant reciprocal negative regulation of expression or activities of BCL6 and p53 in germinal cancer B cells. In this study, we found that BCL6 interacts with p53 and represses expression of p53 target genes that regulate the cell cycle while also modulating acetylation of p53 by p300 at lysine 132. In addition, p53 decreases BCL6 expression by molecular interactions involving p53–caspase-1–BCL6 complex formation. We first investigated whether ectopic BCL6 could repress TP53, the transcriptional coactivator p300, and p53 target genes regulating cell cycle and apoptosis. We found that mRNA and protein expression of p21/CDKN1A, MDM2, p53, and p300 was repressed potently by BCL6 in HEK293 cells (Fig. 1A). Despite this strong transcriptional repression of TP53 by BCL6, interestingly, in B cell–derived lymphoma DLBCL, including Ramos Burkitt's lymphoma cells, BCL6 and p53 were expressed at both the mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 1B), suggesting regulatory mechanisms blocking p53 activity important for cell-cycle arrest and/or apoptosis. Moreover, reverse transcription and quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) and Western blotting assays showed that p53-mediated activation of its target genes, including p21/CDKN1A, DR5, and NOXA, might be repressed by ectopic BCL6 in p53- and BCL6-null H1299 lung cancer cells (Fig. 1C and Fig. S1). We further analyzed the functional outcome of counter-regulation of BCL6 and p53 by MTT assays. H1299 cells were transfected with p53 and/or BCL6 expression vectors, and cell proliferation was analyzed by MTT assays. The assays showed that although ectopic BCL6 expression increased cell proliferation, p53 significantly decreased cell proliferation. These results suggest that BCL6 might inhibit p53 activity important for transcriptional activation of p53 target genes, thereby blocking apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest (Fig. 1D). We next analyzed molecular interactions between p53 and BCL6 by co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP)/Western blotting assays, finding that BCL6 interacts with p53 in HEK293 kidney and Ramos lymphoma cells. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein pulldown assays further validated that result, showing that the two proteins interact directly via each other's DNA-binding domains (DBDs) (Fig. 2, A–C). Among several histone acetyltransferase (HAT) proteins that interact with and acetylate p53, p300 plays critical roles in p53-mediated DNA damage responses, such as cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis (Ref. 24Koh D.I. Han D. Ryu H. Choi W.I. Jeon B.N. Kim M.K. Kim Y. Kim J.Y. Parry L. Clarke A.R. Reynolds A.B. Hur M.W. KAISO, a critical regulator of p53-mediated transcription of CDKN1A and apoptotic genes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2014; 111 (25288747): 15078-1508310.1073/pnas.1318780111Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar and references therein). Because BCL6 interacts with p53 and may modulate p53 activity important in DNA damage responses, we tested whether BCL6 physically interacts with p53 and p300 (or other HAT proteins) in Ramos cells exposed to the DNA-damaging agent etoposide. Co-IP and Western blotting assays showed that interaction between BCL6 and p300 was increased after etoposide treatment (Fig. 2D, left). IP with anti-p53 antibody also showed that interaction with BCL6 and p300 was increased by etoposide treatment. Although BCL6 bands appear to be similar, considering significantly lower expression by etoposide treatment, interaction among p53, p300, and BCL6 was increased (Fig. 2D, middle). In the same context, IP with anti-p300 antibody also suggested an increase in interaction between p300 and BCL6 by etoposide treatment (Fig. 2D, right). In contrast, BCL6 did not interact with the HAT Tip60 nor did PCAF (Fig. 2D). Because BCL6 interacted with p53 and p300, we next questioned whether BCL6 might affect p300 acetylation of p53 and, if so, by what mechanism. Liquid chromatography-tandem MS (LC-MS/MS) analysis of an in vitro p53 acetylation reaction mixture revealed that BCL6 inhibited p300 acetylation of p53 Lys-132 (Fig. 3, A and B, and Fig. S2). This specific residue was previously characterized as a target site for ubiquitination (40Chan W.M. Mak M.C. Fung T.K. Lau A. Siu W.Y. Poon R.Y. Ubiquitination of p53 at multiple sites in the DNA-binding domain.Mol. Cancer Res. 2006; 4 (16446403): 15-2510.1158/1541-7786.MCR-05-0097Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and possibly acetylation. We further tested whether inhibition of acetylation at p53 Lys-132 significantly affected transcription of a p53-responsive pG13-Luc reporter plasmid. Transient transcription assays revealed that potent transcriptional activation of pG13-Luc by p53 was repressed by coexpressed BCL6. p53K132R, a nonacetylatable p53 mutant, lacked the ability to transactivate the Luc reporter. We also observed similar results with the reporter construct pGL2–5x (p53RE)-Luc with the p53 response element of CDKN1A (Fig. 3C). ChIP assays further showed that BCL6 decreased DNA binding of p53 to the p53REs of the CDKN1A, DR5, and NOXA promoters. p53K132R showed significantly attenuated DNA binding activity (Fig. 3D). Also, Western blot analysis showed that up-regulation of p53 target gene (e.g. p21) was attenuated by coexpression of BCL6. And p53K132R did not activate p53 target gene (Fig. 3E). Cell proliferation assays showed that H1299 lung cancer cells with ectopic coexpression of p53 and BCL6 grew more slowly than did BCL6-expressing cells. However, cells expressing BCL6 and p53K132R proliferated as fast as BCL6-expressing cells. p53K132R showed little inhibitory effect of p53 on cell proliferation by BCL6 (Fig. 3F). We also tested whether p53K132Q, a mimic of acetylated p53 Lys-132, could inhibit cell proliferation. p53K132Q showed activity similar to that of p53WT on cell proliferation (Fig. 3G). To demonstrate that BCL6 affects the acetylation of p53 by p300, we tested whether p53K132Q can overcome BCL6 effects on cell growth using the p300 inhibitor A-485 (Fig. 3H). MTT assays clearly showed that BCL6 increased cell proliferation, and coexpression of p53 significantly attenuated cell proliferation. Coexpression of BCL6, p53K132Q, and A-485 showed potent inhibition of cell proliferation, and the cell growth–inhibitory activity of p53K132Q was not affected by the p300 inhibitor. Thus, p53K132Q is fully functional, strongly supporting p53 Lys-132 as the target of BCL6's anti-p53 action. RT-qPCR and Western blotting assays of spleen tissues of WT and Bcl6 knockout mice using an anti-acetylated p53 Lys-132 specific antibody revealed that BCL6 decreased acetylation of p53 at Lys-132, resulting in silencing of p21/Cdnk1, Noxa, and Dr5 in vivo (Fig. 3I). These results suggest that inhibition of acetylation of p53 Lys-132 is important and sufficient for BCL6-mediated inactivation of p53 activity. To study the correlation between BCL6 and p53 expression, H1299, HCT116 p53-null, and HEK293 cells were cotransfected with both p53 and BCL6 expression vectors. BCL6 protein expression was decreased by ectopic p53 (Fig. 4, A–C). Also, ectopic expression of p53 negatively correlated with BCL6 in Ramos lymphoma cells transfected with a p53 expression vector. However, BCL6 transcription was not affected by p53 (Fig. 4D). Not only did BCL6 decrease p53 expression, but p53 reciprocally down-regulated BCL6 expression. Based on these findings, we investigated whether “hot spot” p53 mutations could also affect BCL6 expression. These results showed that, depending on the types of mutations (17Rivlin N. Brosh R. Oren M. Rotter V. Mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene: important milestones at the various steps of tumorigenesis.Genes Cancer. 2011; 2 (21779514): 466-47410.1177/1947601911408889Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar), BCL6 expression was either decreased or unaffected (Fig. 4E). These data indicate that BCL6 and p53 negatively regulate each other's expression or activity, thus establishing their antagonistic coexistence in B cell–derived lymphoma cells and possibly in other cell types expressing aberrant BCL6 and p53, such as those we tested, H1299, HCT116 p53-null, and HEK293 cells. To investigate how p53 regulates BCL6 expression, H1299 cells were transfected with BCL6 and/or p53 expression vectors and analyzed for protein expression by Western blotting. BCL6 protein was significantly lower in the presence of p53 and may be degraded more rapidly (Fig. 5A). Treatment with MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, did not restore BCL6 protein expression, suggesting that p53-mediated BCL6 down-regulation was probably not via ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis (Fig. 5B). However, treatment of the cells with the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk prevented BCL6 degradation (Fig. 5C), endogenous BCL6 expression was also down-regulated by etoposide-induced p53, and that down-regulation was also inhibited by Z-VAD-fmk (Fig. 5D). These results suggest that p53 may decrease BCL6 expression via caspase activity. Accordingly, the genetic status (WT or mutated) of p53 may affect expression of BCL6 and would therefore be likely to affect B cell proliferation and oncogenesis. We next investigated which caspases cleave overexpressed BCL6 in H1299 cells or recombinant BCL6. In vitro caspase assays, performed using active recombinant caspases-1–10 and BCL6, showed that BCL6 was cleaved by caspases-1, -4, -5, -6, -8, and -10 (Fig. 6A). Moreover, Western blot analysis of reaction mixtures of H1299 cell lysates with ectopic BCL6 and recombinant caspases-1–10 showed that BCL6 was strongly cleaved by caspases-1, -4, -5, -8, and -10 but only weakly by caspases-2, -6, and -9 (Fig. 6B). Among the 10 caspases tested, we assessed whether BCL6 was efficiently cleaved by caspase-1 in vitro. p53 potently decreased BCL6 expression, probably by endogenous caspase(s). In H1299 cells transfected with BCL6 and p53 expression vectors, knockd"

Giardia-infected squirrel monkeys were treated with commercially available fenbendazole (FBZ)-medicated monkey chow. Immune responses were compared between historical controls (Giardia naïve, untreated with FBZ (control animals)) and Giardia-infected, FBZ-treated squirrel monkeys (study animals). Peripheral blood lymphocytes from study monkeys had significantly lower stimulation indices compared to control animals when cultured in vitro with concanavalin A (Con A) (p<0.0001), phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) (p<0.0001) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (p<0.0001). PBMCs were also analyzed for IFN-γ producing cells in response to stimulation with Con A, PHA, PWM, and LPS by the cytokine ELISPOT assay. Significantly higher responses to Con A- (p<0.0001), and PHA- (p<0.001) stimulated cultures from Giardia-infected and fenbendazole treated compared to controls. Flow cytometric analysis for expression of cell surface markers revealed a significant increase in B- and NKT-lymphocytes and significant decrease in CD14+CD16+ monocytes after FBZ treatment. Also, circulating plasma cytokines IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-12p40, IL-1β, IL-10, IL-13, IL-1ra, IL-6 and IL-4 were significantly decreased after FBZ treatment. Comparison of hematologic parameters between controls and FBZ-treated squirrel monkeys revealed significantly lower numbers of total leukocytes, neutrophils, monocytes, and eosinophils compared to controls. However, erythrocyte indices (red cell count, hemoglobin and hematocrit were significantly higher in FBZ-treated monkeys. Our findings suggest that fenbendazole treatment may alter sensitive immune and molecular measures of inflammation.

https://openalex.org/W2900106816,"Matriptase is a member of the type-II transmembrane serine protease (TTSP) family and plays a crucial role in the development and maintenance of epithelial tissues. As all chymotrypsin-like serine proteases, matriptase is synthesized as a zymogen (proform), requiring a cleavage event for full activity. Recent studies suggest that the zymogen of matriptase possesses enough catalytic activity to not only facilitate autoactivation, but also carry out its in vivo functions, which include activating several proteolytic and signaling cascades. Inhibition of zymogen matriptase may therefore be a highly effective approach for limiting matriptase activity. To this end, here we sought to characterize the catalytic activity of human zymogen matriptase and to develop mAb inhibitors against this enzyme form. Using a mutated variant of matriptase in which the serine protease domain is locked in the zymogen conformation, we confirmed that the zymogen form of human matriptase has catalytic activity. Moreover, the crystal structure of the catalytic domain of zymogen matriptase was solved to 2.5 Å resolution to characterize specific antibody-based matriptase inhibitors and to further structure-based studies. Finally, we describe the first antibody-based competitive inhibitors that target both the zymogen and activated forms of matriptase. We propose that these antibodies provide a more efficient way to regulate matriptase activity by targeting the protease both before and after its activation and may be of value for both research and preclinical applications.

Unregulated matriptase activity has been shown to play a role in several pathological conditions, including cancer. In several cancers, an excess of matriptase compared with its inhibitors HAI-1 and HAI-2 is observed, which shifts the balance in favor of protease activity, causing detrimental pro-carcinogenic effects (13Sales K.U.

Moreover, elevated matriptase protein levels in tumors have been shown to correlate with a poor prognosis (15Tanabe L.M. List K.

Classically, chymotrypsin-like serine proteases are synthesized as inactive precursors, termed zymogens. The zymogen is activated by a specific cleavage in a conserved activation loop, resulting in a well-described structural rearrangement leading to the formation of a functional protease (16Huber R.

Freeman & Co., New York2012Google Scholar). Although zymogens are considered to be inactive, exceptions exist. The zymogen form of tissue-type plasminogen activator has significant catalytic activity due to a unique structural feature in which a lysine side chain near the activation hole in the catalytic domain is able to substitute for the hydrogen bond that is normally not formed until activation cleavage results in the insertion of a newly released N terminus (19Madison E.L. Kobe A. Gething M.J. Sambrook J.F. Goldsmith E.J. Converting tissue plasminogen activator to a zymogen: a regulatory triad of Asp-His-Ser.Science. 1993; 262 (8211162): 419-42110.1126/science.8211162Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the zymogen form of rat matriptase has been shown to harbor significant catalytic activity, although no obvious structural or sequence-based reason has yet been proposed (20Inouye K.

Several studies have also provided strong evidence for human zymogen matriptase being able to autoactivate, suggesting a basal activity for the matriptase zymogen (21Oberst M.D. Williams C.A.

Furthermore, we have previously shown that the zymogen form of matriptase reacts with a peptide inhibitor biotin-Arg-Gln-Arg-Arg chloromethyl ketone (CMK) (23Godiksen S. Soendergaard C. Friis S. Jensen J.K. Bornholdt J. Sales K.U. Huang M. Bugge T.H. Vogel L.K.

Finally, it was recently shown that a nonactivatable (zymogen-locked) version of mouse matriptase was able to support the natural function of matriptase in a transgenic mouse model system where natural matriptase had been ablated, in strong support of a physiological role of zymogen activity of matriptase (24Friis S. Tadeo D. Le-Gall S.M. Jürgensen H.J. Sales K.U. Camerer E. Bugge T.H.

As matriptase is an attractive molecular target in basic research and pharmacological intervention, there has been much interest in developing inhibitors. Currently, several active-site inhibitors against matriptase have been engineered, with varying success due to lack of affinity, specificity, or both. Active-site inhibitors include modified naturally occurring cyclopeptides and several monoclonal antibodies (25Gray K. Elghadban S. Thongyoo P. Owen K.A. Szabo R. Bugge T.H. Tate E.W.

To date, only one set of compounds has been reported to target the zymogen form of matriptase, the small organochemicals termed compounds 1–4, which all showed an improved inhibitory effect toward matriptase-mediated activation of prostasin as compared with an active-site inhibitor of activated matriptase. However, the reported IC50 values were in the low micromolar range, the best being 2.6 μm, and the information regarding specificity and mechanism remains to be addressed (28Xu Z. Chen Y.W. Battu A. Wilder P. Weber D. Yu W. Mackerell A.D. Chen L.M. Chai K.X. Johnson M.D. Lin C.Y. Targeting zymogen activation to control the matriptase-prostasin proteolytic cascade.J. Med. Chem. 2011; 54 (21966950): 7567-757810.1021/jm200920sCrossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The present study was initiated to investigate the catalytic activity of the zymogen form of human matriptase. We show that a zymogen-locked mutant of human matriptase has significant catalytic activity. Furthermore, two monoclonal antibodies (aZ-mAb-6 and aZ-mAb-7) were developed as competitive inhibitors of both zymogen and activated matriptase. These antibodies bind with high affinity and specificity and represent new tools for pharmacological intervention by targeting both zymogen and activated matriptase to ensure efficient shutdown of all matriptase activity. In addition, the X-ray crystal structure of the catalytic domain of matriptase in its zymogen form was solved. This new structure facilitated the antibody characterization in the present study and will provide a structural basis for future studies of the zymogen form of matriptase. To characterize the catalytic activity of matriptase in its zymogen form, we prepared a zymogen variant of the serine protease domain (SPD) by recombinant expression in yeast (Pichia pastoris). The sequence Cys604–Val855 of human matriptase was fused to an N-terminal His tag, and the mutation N164Q was introduced to avoid N-glycosylation. An additional mutation in the activation cleavage site (R614A) created a variant of matriptase locked in the zymogen form (Fig. 1B). The resulting 29-kDa recombinant protein was used as a representative of the zymogen form of matriptase termed zSPD. Zymogen purity is >95% as demonstrated by a Coomassie-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 1C). The WT SPD of matriptase was expressed in Escherichia coli and refolded in vitro. As this recombinant matriptase spontaneously autoactivated during purification, as was observed by SDS-PAGE band shift and verified by MS and chromogenic activity assays (data not shown), this is henceforth used as a representative of the activated form of matriptase termed acSPD. Hydrolysis of the chromogenic peptide substrate, isoleucil-prolyl-arginine-p-nitroaniline (S-2288, Chromogenix) by either zSPD or acSPD was measured, and the corresponding enzymatic parameters Km and kcat were calculated (Table 1 and Fig. 2A). The catalytic efficiencies (kcat/Km) were determined to be 3.0 × 107 ± 7 × 107 m−1 s−1 and 1.01 × 109 ± 217 × 109 m−1 s−1 for zSPD and acSPD, respectively. By calculating the ratio of the catalytic efficiencies, a zymogenicity factor of 33 ± 11 was obtained, which corresponds to zSPD having an apparent catalytic activity of ∼3% of that of acSPD.Table 1The zymogenicity factor of matriptaseKmVmaxkcatkcat/KmZymogenicity factorμmμm s−1104 s−1μm−1 s−1zSPD256 ± 54295 ± 930.77 ± 0.0930 ± 733 ± 11acSPD387 ± 74391 ± 3839 ± 41011 ± 217 Open table in a new tab Monoclonal antibodies were generated with zSPD as antigen. A panel of nine monoclonal antibodies (aZ-mAb-1 to -7, aZ-mAb-9, and aZ-mAb-10) was chosen for further examination. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) was used to analyze the binding of the antibodies to zymogen and activated matriptase. All nine monoclonal antibodies bound both zSPD and acSPD with affinities (KD) in the low nanomolar range (Table S1, Fig. 3, and Figs. S1 and S2). The nine monoclonal antibodies underwent further testing to establish any modulatory effect on the catalytic activity of zymogen or activated matriptase. The catalytic activity of zSPD or acSPD toward a peptide substrate was measured in the presence of each antibody (Fig. 2B). Our initial results showed that two antibodies, aZ-mAb-6 and aZ-mAb-7, dose-dependently inhibited the activity of both zSPD and acSPD. The remaining antibodies (aZ-mAb-1, -2, -3, -4, -5, -9, and -10) caused either no inhibition or only partial inhibition. To characterize the mode of inhibition of the antibodies, the Vmax and Km of acSPD in the presence or absence of antibodies were determined (Table 2 and Figs. S3 and S4). We observed an unchanged Vmax and an increased Km in the presence of aZ-mAb-6 and aZ-mAb-7, suggesting a competitive mechanism of inhibition (24Friis S. Tadeo D. Le-Gall S.M. Jürgensen H.J. Sales K.U. Camerer E. Bugge T.H. Matriptase zymogen supports epithelial development, homeostasis and regeneration.BMC Biol. 2017; 15 (28571576): 4610.1186/s12915-017-0384-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). For the antibodies aZ-mAb-1, -2, -3, -5, -9, and -10, little change in Km and Vmax was detected (Table 2), suggesting that they are noncompetitive or mixed inhibitors. As no change was observed for Km and Vmax in the presence of antibody aZ-mAb-4, the lack of inhibitory activity of this antibody was confirmed, and it was used as a comparative control in subsequent experiments. Next, the equilibrium constant (Ki) of aZ-mAb-6 and aZ-mAb-7 against activated matriptase was determined to 21 ± 2 and 9 ± 2 nm, respectively (Fig. 2C). A similar analysis was performed on zSPD, including aZ-mAb-6 and aZ-mAb-7 (Table 2). Again, we observed an unchanged Vmax and an increased Km in support of a competitive mechanism of inhibition for aZ-mAb-6 and aZ-mAb-7. As expected, there was no significant effect of aZ-mAb-4.Table 2Summary of Vmax, Km, kcat, and KiVmaxKmkcatKinμm s−1μm104 s−1nmacSPD No antibody391 ± 38387 ± 7439 ± 4NAaNA, not applicable.5 aZ-mAb-1184 ± 38bStatistically significant difference from “no antibody” by unpaired t test calculated using GraphPad QuickCalcs online software.197 ± 64bStatistically significant difference from “no antibody” by unpaired t test calculated using GraphPad QuickCalcs online software.18 ± 4NA3 aZ-mAb-2348 ± 22489 ± 4535 ± 2NA3 aZ-mAb-3152 ± 27bStatistically significant difference from “no antibody” by unpaired t test calculated using GraphPad QuickCalcs online software.166 ± 36bStatistically significant difference from “no antibody” by unpaired t test calculated using GraphPad QuickCalcs online software.15 ± 3NA3 aZ-mAb-4349 ± 61347 ± 8735 ± 6NA4 aZ-mAb-5339 ± 60421 ± 10234 ± 6NA3 aZ-mAb-6371 ± 35857 ± 84bStatistically significant difference from “no antibody” by unpaired t test calculated using GraphPad QuickCalcs online software.37 ± 421 ± 23 aZ-mAb-7365 ± 191172 ± 255bStatistically significant difference from “no antibody” by unpaired t test calculated using GraphPad QuickCalcs online software.37 ± 29 ± 23 aZ-mAb-9281 ± 58bStatistically significant difference from “no antibody” by unpaired t test calculated using GraphPad QuickCalcs online software.424 ± 10928 ± 6NA3 aZ-mAb-10308 ± 42bStatistically significant difference from “no antibody” by unpaired t test calculated using GraphPad QuickCalcs online software.451 ± 10231 ± 4NA3zSPD No antibody295 ± 93256 ± 540.77 ± 0.09NA10 aZ-mAb-4445 ± 14bStatistically significant difference from “no antibody” by unpaired t test calculated using GraphPad QuickCalcs online software.193 ± 90.89 ± 0.03NA3 aZ-mAB-6260 ± 14901 ± 39bStatistically significant difference from “no antibody” by unpaired t test calculated using GraphPad QuickCalcs online software.0.52 ± 0.03NA3 aZ-mAb-7346 ± 8609 ± 14bStatistically significant difference from “no antibody” by unpaired t test calculated using GraphPad QuickCalcs online software.0.69 ± 0.02NA3a NA, not applicable.b Statistically significant difference from “no antibody” by unpaired t test calculated using GraphPad QuickCalcs online software. Open table in a new tab To ensure that the difference in affinity of the antibodies toward acSPD and zSPD is not due to antibody cleavage catalyzed by matriptase, the stability of the antibodies was analyzed following prolonged incubation with matriptase. Antibodies aZ-mAb-6 and aZ-mAb-7 were incubated with acSPD at a 1:1 molar ratio before SDS-PAGE analysis. The gel showed no sign of matriptase-catalyzed antibody degradation (Fig. 4). The active sites of serine proteases are generally highly conserved, and therefore inhibitory compounds often inhibit several related proteases. To gain insight about the inhibitory specificity of antibodies aZ-mAb-6 and aZ-mAb-7, three human serine proteases closely related to matriptase were tested: urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), hepatocyte growth factor activator, and hepsin. Even at an antibody concentration of 400 nm, a 20-fold higher concentration than the inhibitory constant (Ki) toward matriptase, no inhibition was observed (Fig. 5). Furthermore, no inhibition was observed toward the mouse ortholog of matriptase (Fig. 5), whose catalytic domain shares 87% identity to the human protein. Together, these observations strongly suggest that antibodies aZ-mAb-6 and aZ-mAb-7 have high specificity toward human matriptase. To examine the potential use of antibodies aZ-mAb-6 and aZ-mAb-7 for the study of matriptase activity in complex biological samples, an assay was established using cultured cells. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with combinations of WT full-length membrane-anchored matriptase and two variants of its cognate inhibitor HAI-2. Matriptase needs co-expression with the inhibitors HAI-1 or HAI-2 to obtain significant levels of plasma membrane–bound matriptase. Either WT HAI-2 or a HAI-2 variant with compromised inhibitory activity (HAI-2 C47F) due to a mutation in the predicted P2 position of the inhibitory loop of Kunitz domain 1 was used (29Nonboe A.W. Krigslund O. Soendergaard C. Skovbjerg S. Friis S. Andersen M.N. Ellis V. Kawaguchi M. Kataoka H. Bugge T.H. Vogel L.K. HAI-2 stabilizes, inhibits and regulates SEA-cleavage-dependent secretory transport of matriptase.Traffic. 2017; 18 (28371047): 378-39110.1111/tra.12482Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Transiently transfected cells were lysed, and the peptidolytic activity of the cell lysates was assayed with or without the antibodies aZ-mAb-6 and aZ-mAb-7 or a control antibody (anti-uPA) (Fig. 6A). Both antibodies aZ-mAb-6 and aZ-mAb-7 but not the control antibody inhibited the proteolytic turnover of the broad-spectrum serine protease substrate; this activity was interpreted as derived from unopposed matriptase in either the active zymogen form or the activated form. Little or no background activity was observed in mock-transfected cells or cells transfected with matriptase and WT HAI-2, suggesting that little to no unopposed matriptase is present under these conditions at our detection limit (<10 pm active sites as estimated from in vitro enzymatic assays). When matriptase was co-expressed with HAI-2 C47F, we observed a clear proteolytic activity, which could be silenced by aZ-mAb-6 and aZ-mAb-7 but not by the control antibody (anti-uPA), strongly suggesting the presence of unopposed matriptase activity under these conditions. To examine the ability of antibodies aZ-mAb-6 and aZ-mAb-7 to inhibit the cleavage of a natural matriptase substrate, a pro-HGF cleavage assay was established. Pro-HGF was incubated with or without zSPD or acZPD in the presence or absence of inhibitors. Both antibodies aZ-mAb-6 and aZ-mAb-7, but not the control antibody (anti-uPA), inhibited the cleavage of pro-HGF by both acSPD and zSPD into its α and β chains (Fig. 6B, top and bottom, respectively). A peptide inhibitor, biotin-RQRR-CMK (23Godiksen S. Soendergaard C. Friis S. Jensen J.K. Bornholdt J. Sales K.U. Huang M. Bugge T.H. Vogel L.K. Detection of active matriptase using a biotinylated chloromethyl ketone peptide.PLoS One. 2013; 8 (24204759): e7714610.1371/journal.pone.0077146Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), was included as a positive control. These results strongly suggest that antibodies aZ-mAb-6 and aZ-mAb-7 inhibit matriptase-catalyzed cleavage of a physiologically relevant protein substrate. As competitive inhibitors, we expect both antibodies to bind in or near the active site to directly compete with substrates. We presume that the epitopes of antibodies aZ-mAb-6 and aZ-mAb-7 are conserved between zymogen and activated matriptase, which is why some of the following experiments were only carried out only on activated protein. First, it was investigated whether mutation of the nucleophilic serine 805 (Ser195) in the active site of matriptase affected binding of the antibodies to zymogen or activated matriptase. Using SPR, no differences were seen in the KD for binding of antibodies aZ-mAb-6 and aZ-mAb-7 to zSPD, zSPD-S805A, or their activated counterparts (data not shown). This suggests that antibodies aZ-mAb-6 and aZ-mAb-7 do not interact directly with the nucleophile serine. Next, possible interaction between the antibodies and the specificity pockets S2–S4 of matriptase, as S1 is not present in the zymogen, was probed by competition with either the peptide inhibitor biotin-RQRR-CMK (23Godiksen S.

A high copy pRi-repABC variant plasmid, pTF::Ri, which does not improve the frequency of single copy transgenic plants, has been reported in the literature. Sequencing the high copy pTF::Ri repABC operon revealed the presence of two mutations: one silent mutation and one missense mutation that changes a tyrosine to a histidine (Y299H) in a highly conserved area of the C-terminus of the RepB protein (RepBY299H). Reproducing these mutations in the wild-type pRi-repABC binary vector showed that Agrobacterium cells with the RepBY299H mutation grow faster on both solidified and in liquid medium, and have higher plasmid copy number as determined by ddPCR. In order to investigate the impact of the RepBY299H mutation on transformation and quality plant production, the RepBY299H mutated pRi-repABC binary vector was compared with the original wild-type pRi-repABC binary vector and a multi-copy oriV binary vector in canola transformation. Molecular analyses of the canola transgenic plants demonstrated that the multi-copy pRi-repABC with the RepBY299H mutation provides no advantage in generating high frequency single copy, backbone-free transgenic plants in comparison with the single copy wild-type pRi-repABC binary vector."

Their morphology impose constraints on their ecological functions and reflect their evolutionary history. To explore the potential functional basis underlying the similarities and differences in barnacle larval form, we conducted a meta-analysis on the shape of the barnacle nauplii's cephalic shield and examined its relation to larval size, trophic mode, pelagic larval duration and habitat. Nauplii cephalic shield morphology of 102 species were quantified with normalized elliptic Fourier analysis. Most of the species were distributed around the center of the morphospace but a few extreme groups occupied the periphery: nauplii that were large and lecithotrophic. Subsequent principal component regression analyses showed that larval size was a good predictor of the first shape variations axis (aspect ratio). After allometry adjustment, nauplii from different trophic modes differentiated along the second axis of the major shape variations (relative frontal horn length). Habitat was a poor predictor of variations in naupliar body form, but it could be used to differentiate extreme morphology groups from other nauplii. Our result suggests that size-related biomechanical or developmental constraints and feeding requirements are important in shaping the evolution of the naupliar body form. Within the limitations of these functional constraints, habitat drives the divergence of extreme morphology groups from the majority of species. Our comparative morphometrics analysis demonstrated how variations in larval body form can be quantitatively linked to the functional needs that constrain or drive their diversity, and inform further empirical experiments on larval functional morphology."

I signed the document and confidently submitted it to my homeroom teacher, who promised to return it to me on the final day of senior year.

Four winding years later, I was horrified to open the envelope. I still loved science, but I had discovered a passion for doing research and now envisioned a future in the lab. Embarrassed that my plans had changed and unsettled by learning that the path to satisfaction was not as clear as I had hoped, I ripped up my 5-year plan and buried the pieces in the trash. I promised myself I would not make such a mistake again. The next time I made a plan, I would execute it flawlessly.

Each of my first 2 years as an undergraduate, I recorded my progress against a new plan: After finishing my bachelor's degree, I would enroll as a Ph.D. student in the same pharmacology lab where I was already conducting research. I completed my annual progress report—in pen. Then, I discussed it with my faculty mentor, and we both signed it in permanent ink. Having a detailed blueprint, verified by a mentor I looked up to, made me feel secure in my future.

I was hesitant to change my life's blueprint yet again. But as I prepared to fill out my annual progress report with my favorite black pen for the third and final time as an undergrad, just 9 months before graduation, I realized that I wanted to broaden my horizons. I still hoped to get a Ph.D.—but in basic biology instead of pharmacology.

To my surprise, my faculty mentor praised me for realizing that it was time to make a change, as opposed to blindly sticking to my earlier path. But he insisted that I be precise about my new direction: What would I study, and in which lab?

I eagerly devised a new plan. I was comfortable giving up plan A—but if I was going to switch to plan B, it needed to be as clear and detailed as before.

Today, though, in the fourth year of my Ph.D. program, I don't have a plan A or even a firm plan B. I filled out my most recent career development plan in pencil, smudged it by erasing and changing entries, and left a number of boxes blank. I may yet pursue an academic career, as I had written with such confidence in previous years. Perhaps I will become a scientific editor. Or maybe I will end up going some other direction I haven't yet considered.

To be entirely honest, not knowing what my future holds is a little uncomfortable. It is hard to give up knowing—or thinking I know—exactly what I want to do and how I will get there. But I'm grateful to have room to grow and develop in unexpected directions. So my new mantra is “be flexible, embrace change and uncertainty—and always write in pencil.”

https://openalex.org/W2900062030,"Endo-ß-1,4-glucanase AkEG21 belonging to glycosyl hydrolase family 45 (GHF45) is the most abundant cellulase in the digestive fluid of sea hare (Aplysia kurodai). The specific activity of this 21-kDa enzyme is considerably lower than those of other endo ß-1,4-glucanases in the digestive fluid of A. kurodai, therefore its role in whole cellulose hydrolysis by sea hare is still uncertain. Although AkEG21 has a catalytic domain without a cellulose binding domain, it demonstrated stable binding to cellulose fibers, similar to that of fungal cellobiohydrolase (CBH) 1 and CBH 2, which is strongly inhibited by cellohexaose, suggesting the involvement of the catalytic site in cellulose binding. Cellulose-bound AkEG21 hydrolyzed cellulose to cellobiose, cellotriose and cellotetraose, but could not digest an external substrate, azo-carboxymethyl cellulose. Cellulose hydrolysis was considerably stimulated by the synergistic action of cellulose-bound AkEG21 and AkEG45, another ß-1,4-endoglucanase present in the digestive fluid of sea hare; however no synergy in carboxymethylcellulose hydrolysis was observed. When AkEG21 was removed from the digestive fluid by immunoprecipitation, the cellulose hydrolyzing activity of the fluid was significantly reduced, indicating a critical role of AkEG21 in cellulose hydrolysis by A. kurodai. These findings suggest that AkEG21 is a processive endoglucanase functionally equivalent to the CBH, which provides a CBH-independent mechanism for the mollusk to digest seaweed cellulose to glucose."
