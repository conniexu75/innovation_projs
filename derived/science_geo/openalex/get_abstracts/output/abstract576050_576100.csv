https://openalex.org/W2562211106,"Internal bases in mRNA can be subjected to modifications that influence the fate of mRNA in cells. One of the most prevalent modified bases is found at the 5' end of mRNA, at the first encoded nucleotide adjacent to the 7-methylguanosine cap. Here we show that this nucleotide, N6,2'-O-dimethyladenosine (m6Am), is a reversible modification that influences cellular mRNA fate. Using a transcriptome-wide map of m6Am we find that m6Am-initiated transcripts are markedly more stable than mRNAs that begin with other nucleotides. We show that the enhanced stability of m6Am-initiated transcripts is due to resistance to the mRNA-decapping enzyme DCP2. Moreover, we find that m6Am is selectively demethylated by fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO). FTO preferentially demethylates m6Am rather than N6-methyladenosine (m6A), and reduces the stability of m6Am mRNAs. Together, these findings show that the methylation status of m6Am in the 5' cap is a dynamic and reversible epitranscriptomic modification that determines mRNA stability."
https://openalex.org/W2561301122,"A large-scale epigenome-wide association study identifies changes in DNA methylation associated with body mass index in blood and adipose tissue, and correlates DNA methylation sites with high risk of incident type 2 diabetes. Obesity is a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes and related metabolic disorders. Genetic association studies have identified genomic loci associated with obesity, and recent studies have also suggested associations with DNA methylation. These authors report an epigenome-wide association study for body mass index (BMI), identifying an association with DNA methylation at 187 loci in blood and adipose tissue. They find that these methylation changes are secondary to adiposity and are also associated with an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, independent of conventional risk factors. Approximately 1.5 billion people worldwide are overweight or affected by obesity, and are at risk of developing type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and related metabolic and inflammatory disturbances1,2. Although the mechanisms linking adiposity to associated clinical conditions are poorly understood, recent studies suggest that adiposity may influence DNA methylation3,4,5,6, a key regulator of gene expression and molecular phenotype7. Here we use epigenome-wide association to show that body mass index (BMI; a key measure of adiposity) is associated with widespread changes in DNA methylation (187 genetic loci with P < 1 × 10−7, range P = 9.2 × 10−8 to 6.0 × 10−46; n = 10,261 samples). Genetic association analyses demonstrate that the alterations in DNA methylation are predominantly the consequence of adiposity, rather than the cause. We find that methylation loci are enriched for functional genomic features in multiple tissues (P < 0.05), and show that sentinel methylation markers identify gene expression signatures at 38 loci (P < 9.0 × 10−6, range P = 5.5 × 10−6 to 6.1 × 10−35, n = 1,785 samples). The methylation loci identify genes involved in lipid and lipoprotein metabolism, substrate transport and inflammatory pathways. Finally, we show that the disturbances in DNA methylation predict future development of type 2 diabetes (relative risk per 1 standard deviation increase in methylation risk score: 2.3 (2.07–2.56); P = 1.1 × 10−54). Our results provide new insights into the biologic pathways influenced by adiposity, and may enable development of new strategies for prediction and prevention of type 2 diabetes and other adverse clinical consequences of obesity."

https://openalex.org/W2563186352,"XRCC1 is a molecular scaffold protein that assembles multi-protein complexes involved in DNA single-strand break repair. Here we show that biallelic mutations in the human XRCC1 gene are associated with ocular motor apraxia, axonal neuropathy, and progressive cerebellar ataxia. Cells from a patient with mutations in XRCC1 exhibited not only reduced rates of single-strand break repair but also elevated levels of protein ADP-ribosylation. This latter phenotype is recapitulated in a related syndrome caused by mutations in the XRCC1 partner protein PNKP and implicates hyperactivation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase/s as a cause of cerebellar ataxia. Indeed, remarkably, genetic deletion of Parp1 rescued normal cerebellar ADP-ribose levels and reduced the loss of cerebellar neurons and ataxia in Xrcc1-defective mice, identifying a molecular mechanism by which endogenous single-strand breaks trigger neuropathology. Collectively, these data establish the importance of XRCC1 protein complexes for normal neurological function and identify PARP1 as a therapeutic target in DNA strand break repair-defective disease."
https://openalex.org/W2510473361,"Engineered spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in cold atom systems can aid in the study of novel synthetic materials and complex condensed matter phenomena. Despite great advances, alkali atom SOC systems are hindered by heating from spontaneous emission, which limits the observation of many-body effects, motivating research into potential alternatives. Here we demonstrate that SOC can be engineered to occur naturally in a one-dimensional fermionic 87Sr optical lattice clock (OLC). In contrast to previous SOC experiments, in this work the SOC is both generated and probed using a direct ultra-narrow optical clock transition between two electronic orbital states. We use clock spectroscopy to prepare lattice band populations, internal electronic states, and quasimomenta, as well as to produce SOC dynamics. The exceptionally long lifetime of the excited clock state (160 s) eliminates decoherence and atom loss from spontaneous emission at all relevant experimental timescales, allowing subsequent momentum- and spin-resolved in situ probing of the SOC band structure and eigenstates. We utilize these capabilities to study Bloch oscillations, spin-momentum locking, and Van Hove singularities in the transition density of states. Our results lay the groundwork for the use of OLCs to probe novel SOC phases of matter."
https://openalex.org/W2563122014,"Background The promotion and maintenance of higher physical activity (PA) levels in the older population is an imperative for cognitive and healthy ageing but it is unclear what approaches are best suited to achieve this for the increasing number of older people living in the community. Effective policies should be informed by robust, multi-disciplinary and multi-dimensional evidence, which not only seeks what works, but in ‘what context? In addition to evidence on the efficacy and effectiveness of PA for maintaining cognitive health, social contexts such as ‘how do we actually get older people to partake in PA?’ and ‘how do we sustain that activity long-term?’ also need highlighting. This review is part of a comprehensive evidence synthesis of preventive interventions in older age, with a focus on healthy behaviours to identify evidence gaps and inform policy relating to ageing well and cognitive health. An overview of systematic reviews of PA was conducted to explore three topics: (1) PA efficacy or effectiveness for primary prevention of cognitive decline in 55+; (2) Interventions efficacious or effective for increasing PA uptake and maintenance in 55+; (3) barriers and facilitators to PA in 55+. Methods Multiple databases were searched for studies in English from OECD countries between 2000 and 2016. Quality of included reviews in questions (1) and (2) were assessed using AMSTAR. Review protocols were registered on PROSPERO (CRD42014015554, 42014015584, CRD42014015557) and reviews follow PRISMA guideline. Findings Overall, 40 systematic reviews were included. Question 1 (n = 14). 8,360 participants. Evidence suggests that PA confer mild positive effects on cognition in older adults with and without previous cognitive impairment. However, there is insufficient evidence of a dose-response relationship. Evidence on the effects of PA on delay of dementia onset is inconclusive. Question 2 (n = 17). 79,650 participants. Evidence supports the effectiveness of a variety of interventions, including group delivered, centre-based and cognitive approaches on short-term uptake of PA behaviour. Question 3 (n = 9). 22,413 participants. Barriers include health status, previous PA habits and experiences, and cultural sensitivity, while facilitators include enjoyable activities and convenient scheduling. Conclusion PA can offer small benefits to brain health, but evidence on how much activity is required to produce this effect is lacking. Evidence on the effectiveness of PA for preventing dementia and cognitive decline is lacking. Behavioural (walking, exercise) and cognitive (counselling and motivational interviews) interventions are effective for short-term uptake of physical activity in older people. In order to maintain long-term participation in PA, individualised interventions modelled using behavioural theories may be required. Public health messages should be aimed at promoting acceptable levels of PA above normal daily activities in older people. Policy and strategies aimed at increasing PA in older people should be encouraged while considering barriers and facilitators to behaviour change."
https://openalex.org/W2563306975,"CLC proteins transport chloride (Cl-) ions across cellular membranes to regulate muscle excitability, electrolyte movement across epithelia, and acidification of intracellular organelles. Some CLC proteins are channels that conduct Cl- ions passively, whereas others are secondary active transporters that exchange two Cl- ions for one H+. The structural basis underlying these distinctive transport mechanisms is puzzling because CLC channels and transporters are expected to share the same architecture on the basis of sequence homology. Here we determined the structure of a bovine CLC channel (CLC-K) using cryo-electron microscopy. A conserved loop in the Cl- transport pathway shows a structure markedly different from that of CLC transporters. Consequently, the cytosolic constriction for Cl- passage is widened in CLC-K such that the kinetic barrier previously postulated for Cl-/H+ transporter function would be reduced. Thus, reduction of a kinetic barrier in CLC channels enables fast flow of Cl- down its electrochemical gradient."

https://openalex.org/W2565060871,"Chromium (Cr) is used in many industries and it is widely distributed in the environment. Exposure to Cr dust has been reported among workers at these industries. Beside its hazardous effects on the lungs, brain injury could be induced, as the absorption of substances through the nasal membrane has been found to provide them a direct delivery to the brain. We investigated the distribution and the effects of Cr in both brain and lung following the intranasal instillation of potassium dichromate (inPDC) in rats. Simultaneously, we used the common intraperitoneal (ipPDC) rat model of acute Cr-toxicity for comparison. Thirty male Wistar rats were randomly allocated into five groups (n = 6); each received a single dose of saline, ipPDC (15 mg/kg), or inPDC in three dose levels: 0.5, 1, or 2 mg/kg. Locomotor activity was assessed before and 24 h after PDC administration, then, the lungs and brain were collected for biochemical, histopathological, and immunohistochemical investigations. Treatment of rats with ipPDC resulted in a recognition of 36% and 31% of the injected dose of Cr in the brain and lung tissues, respectively. In inPDC-treated rats, targeting the brain by Cr was increased in a dose-dependent manner to reach 46% of the instilled dose in the group treated with the highest dose. Moreover, only this high dose of inPDC resulted in a delivery of a significant concentration of Cr, which represented 42% of the instilled dose, to the lungs. The uppermost alteration in the rats locomotor activity as well as in the brain and lung histopathological features and contents of oxidative stress biomarkers, interleukin-1β (IL-1β), phosphorylated protein kinase B (PKB), and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) were observed in the rats treated with inPDC (2 mg/kg). The findings revealed that these toxic manifestations were directly proportional to the delivered concentration of Cr to the tissue. In conclusion, the study showed that a comparably higher concentrations of Cr and more elevated levels of oxidative stress and inflammatory markers were observed in brain and lung tissues of rats subjected to inPDC in a dose that is just 0.13 that of ipPDC dose commonly used in Cr-induced toxicity studies. Therefore, the study suggests a high risk of brain-targeting injury among individuals environmentally or occupationally exposed to Cr dust, even in low doses, and an additional risk of lung injury with higher Cr concentrations. Moreover, the study introduces inPDC (2 mg/kg)-instillation as a new experimental animal model suitable to study the acute brain and lung toxicities induced by intranasal exposure to Cr compounds."
https://openalex.org/W2561886199,"Plant-parasitic nematodes form one of the largest sources of biotic stress imposed on plants, and are very difficult to control; among them are the obligate parasites, the sedentary root-knot nematodes (RKNs)-Meloidogyne spp.-which are extremely polyphagous and exploit a very wide range of hosts. Endophytic fungi are organisms that spend most of their life cycle within plant tissue without causing visible damage to the host plant. Many endophytes secrete specialized metabolites and/or emit volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that exhibit biological activity. Recently, we demonstrated that the endophytic fungus Daldinia cf. concentrica secrets biologically active VOCs. Here we examined the ability of the fungus and its VOCs to control the RKN M. javanica both in vitro and greenhouse experiments. The D. cf. concentrica VOCs showed bionematicidal activity against the second-stage juveniles (J2s) of M. javanica. We found that exposure of J2s to fungal volatiles caused 67% reduction in viability, and that application of a synthetic volatile mixture (SVM), comprising 3-methyl-1-butanol, (±)-2-methyl-1-butanol, 4-heptanone, and isoamyl acetate, in volumetric ratio of 1:1:2:1 further reduced J2s viability by 99%. We demonstrated that, although each of the four VOCs significantly reduced the viability of J2s relative to the control, only 4-heptanone elicited the same effect as the whole mixture, with nematicidal activity of 90% reduction in viability of the J2s. Study of the effect of the SVM on egg hatching demonstrated that it decreased eggs hatching by 87%. Finally, application of the SVM to soil inoculated with M. javanica eggs or J2s prior to planting susceptible tomato plants resulted in a significantly reduced galling index and fewer eggs produced on each root system, with no effect on root weight. Thus, D. cf. concentrica and/or SVM based on fungal VOCs may be considered as a novel alternative approach to controlling the RKN M. javanica."
https://openalex.org/W2563470588,"Virus spreading in tissues is determined by virus transport, virus multiplication in host cells and the virus-induced immune response. Cytotoxic T cells remove infected cells with a rate determined by the infection level. The intensity of the immune response has a bell-shaped dependence on the concentration of virus, i.e., it increases at low and decays at high infection levels. A combination of these effects and a time delay in the immune response determine the development of virus infection in tissues like spleen or lymph nodes. The mathematical model described in this work consists of reaction-diffusion equations with a delay. It shows that the different regimes of infection spreading like the establishment of a low level infection, a high level infection or a transition between both are determined by the initial virus load and by the intensity of the immune response. The dynamics of the model solutions include simple and composed waves, and periodic and aperiodic oscillations. The results of analytical and numerical studies of the model provide a systematic basis for a quantitative understanding and interpretation of the determinants of the infection process in target organs and tissues from the image-derived data as well as of the spatiotemporal mechanisms of viral disease pathogenesis, and have direct implications for a biopsy-based medical testing of the chronic infection processes caused by viruses, e.g. HIV, HCV and HBV."
https://openalex.org/W2565150899,"Big changes to the way in which research funding is allocated to UK universities were brought about in the Research Excellence Framework (REF), overseen by the Higher Education Funding Council, England. Replacing the earlier Research Assessment Exercise, the purpose of the REF was to assess the quality and reach of research in UK universities-and allocate funding accordingly. For the first time, this included an assessment of research 'impact', accounting for 20% of the funding allocation. In this article we use a text mining technique to investigate the interpretations of impact put forward via impact case studies in the REF process. We find that institutions have developed a diverse interpretation of impact, ranging from commercial applications to public and cultural engagement activities. These interpretations of impact vary from discipline to discipline and between institutions, with more broad-based institutions depicting a greater variety of impacts. Comparing the interpretations with the score given by REF, we found no evidence of one particular interpretation being more highly rewarded than another. Importantly, we also found a positive correlation between impact score and [overall research] quality score, suggesting that impact is not being achieved at the expense of research excellence."
https://openalex.org/W2563505725,"Heme a is an essential metalloporphyrin cofactor of the mitochondrial respiratory enzyme cytochrome c oxidase (CcO). Its synthesis from heme b requires several enzymes, including the evolutionarily conserved heme a synthase (Cox15). Oligomerization of Cox15 appears to be important for the process of heme a biosynthesis and transfer to maturing CcO. However, the details of this process remain elusive, and the roles of any additional CcO assembly factors that may be involved remain unclear. Here we report the systematic analysis of one such uncharacterized assembly factor, Pet117, and demonstrate in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that this evolutionarily conserved protein is necessary for Cox15 oligomerization and function. Pet117 is shown to reside in the mitochondrial matrix, where it is associated with the inner membrane. Pet117 functions at the later maturation stages of the core CcO subunit Cox1 that precede Cox1 hemylation. Pet117 also physically interacts with Cox15 and specifically mediates the stability of Cox15 oligomeric complexes. This Cox15-Pet117 interaction observed by co-immunoprecipitation persists in the absence of heme a synthase activity, is dependent upon Cox1 synthesis and early maturation steps, and is further dependent upon the presence of the matrix-exposed, unstructured linker region of Cox15 needed for Cox15 oligomerization, suggesting that this region mediates the interaction or that the interaction is lost when Cox15 is unable to oligomerize. Based on these findings, it was concluded that Pet117 mediates coupling of heme a synthesis to the CcO assembly process in eukaryotes.

https://openalex.org/W2563567978,"Background The development of a novel tuberculosis vaccine is a leading global health priority. SRL172, an inactivated, whole-cell mycobacterial vaccine, was safe, immunogenic and reduced the incidence of culture-confirmed tuberculosis in a phase III trial in HIV-infected and BCG immunized adults in Tanzania. Here we describe the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of DAR-901, a booster vaccine against tuberculosis manufactured from the same seed strain using a new scalable method. Methods We evaluated IFN-γ responses by ELISpot and antibody responses by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay in C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice after three doses of DAR-901. In an aerosol challenge model, we evaluated the protective efficacy of the DAR-901 booster in C57BL/6 mice primed with BCG and boosted with two doses of DAR-901 at 4 dosage levels in comparison with homologous BCG boost. Results DAR-901 vaccination elicited IFN-γ responses to mycobacterial antigen preparations derived from both DAR-901 and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. DAR-901 immunization enhanced antibody responses to DAR-901 but not Mycobacterium tuberculosis lysate or purified protein derivative. Among animals primed with BCG, boosting with DAR-901 at 1 mg provided greater protection against aerosol challenge than a homologous BCG boost (lungs P = 0.036, spleen P = 0.028). Conclusions DAR-901 induces cellular and humoral immunity and boosts protection from M. tuberculosis compared to a homologous BCG boost."
https://openalex.org/W2564346784,"Prions or PrPSc are proteinaceous infectious agents that consist of misfolded, self-replicating states of a sialoglycoprotein called the prion protein or PrPC. The current work tests a new hypothesis that sialylation determines the fate of prions in an organism. To begin, we produced control PrPSc from PrPC using protein misfolding cyclic amplification with beads (PMCAb), and also generated PrPSc with reduced sialylation levels using the same method but with partially desialylated PrPC as a substrate (dsPMCAb). Syrian hamsters were inoculated intraperitoneally with brain-derived PrPSc or PrPSc produced in PMCAb or dsPMCAb and then monitored for disease. Animals inoculated with brain- or PMCAb-derived PrPSc developed prion disease, whereas administration of dsPMCAb-derived PrPSc with reduced sialylation did not cause prion disease. Animals inoculated with dsPMCAb-derived material were not subclinical carriers of scrapie, as no PrPSc was detected in brains or spleen of these animals by either Western blotting or after amplification by serial PMCAb. In subsequent experiments, trafficking of brain-, PMCAb-, and dsPMCAb-derived PrPSc to secondary lymphoid organs was monitored in wild type mice. PrPSc sialylation was found to be critical for effective trafficking of PrPSc to secondary lymphoid organs. By 6 hours after inoculation, brain- and PMCAb-derived PrPSc were found in spleen and lymph nodes, whereas dsPMCAb-derived PrPSc was found predominantly in liver. This study demonstrates that the outcome of prion transmission to a wild type host is determined by the sialylation status of the inoculated PrPSc. Furthermore, this work suggests that the sialylation status of PrPSc plays an important role in prion lymphotropism."

https://openalex.org/W2562541172,"Glucocorticoids are a general class of steroids that possess renoprotective activity in glomeruli through their interaction with the glucocorticoid receptor. However, the mechanisms by which glucocorticoids ameliorate proteinuria and glomerular disease are not well understood. In this study, we demonstrated that α actinin 4 (ACTN4), an actin-cross-linking protein known to coordinate cytoskeletal organization, interacts with the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in the nucleus of human podocytes (HPCs), a key cell type in the glomerulus critical for kidney filtration function. The GR-ACTN4 complex enhances glucocorticoid response element (GRE)-driven reporter activity. Stable knockdown of ACTN4 by shRNA in HPCs significantly reduces dexamethasone-mediated induction of GR target genes and GRE-driven reporter activity without disrupting dexamethasone-induced nuclear translocation of GR. Synonymous mutations or protein expression losses in ACTN4 are associated with kidney diseases, including focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, characterized by proteinuria and podocyte injury. We found that focal segmental glomerulosclerosis-linked ACTN4 mutants lose their ability to bind liganded GR and support GRE-mediated transcriptional activity. Mechanistically, GR and ACTN4 interact in the nucleus of HPCs. Furthermore, disruption of the LXXLL nuclear receptor-interacting motif present in ACTN4 results in reduced GR interaction and dexamethasone-mediated transactivation of a GRE reporter while still maintaining its actin-binding activity. In contrast, an ACTN4 isoform, ACTN4 (Iso), that loses its actin-binding domain is still capable of potentiating a GRE reporter. Dexamethasone induces the recruitment of ACTN4 and GR to putative GREs in dexamethasone-transactivated promoters, SERPINE1, ANGPLT4, CCL20, and SAA1 as well as the NF-κB (p65) binding sites on GR-transrepressed promoters such as IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8. Taken together, our data establish ACTN4 as a transcriptional co-regulator that modulates both dexamethasone-transactivated and -transrepressed genes in podocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2566458819,"Prozymes are catalytically inactive enzyme paralogs that dramatically stimulate the function of weakly active enzymes through complex formation. The two prozymes described to date reside in the polyamine biosynthesis pathway of the human parasite Trypanosoma brucei, an early branching eukaryote that lacks transcriptional regulation and regulates its proteome through posttranscriptional and posttranslational means. Arginine methylation is a common posttranslational modification in eukaryotes catalyzed by protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) that are typically thought to function as homodimers. We demonstrate that a major T. brucei PRMT, TbPRMT1, functions as a heterotetrameric enzyme-prozyme pair. The inactive PRMT paralog, TbPRMT1PRO, is essential for catalytic activity of the TbPRMT1ENZ subunit. Mutational analysis definitively demonstrates that TbPRMT1ENZ is the cofactor-binding subunit and carries all catalytic activity of the complex. Our results are the first demonstration of an obligate heteromeric PRMT, and they suggest that enzyme-prozyme organization is expanded in trypanosomes as a posttranslational means of enzyme regulation."

Herein, we identified an FH patient presenting novel compound heterozygote mutations R410S and G592E of the LDL receptor (LDLR). The patient responded modestly to maximum rosuvastatin plus ezetimibe therapy, even in combination with a PCSK9 monoclonal antibody injection. Using cell biology and molecular dynamics simulations, we aimed to define the underlying mechanism(s) by which these LDLR mutations affect LDL metabolism and lead to hypercholesterolemia. Our data showed that the LDLR-G592E is a class 2b mutant, because it mostly failed to exit the endoplasmic reticulum and was degraded. Even though LDLR-R410S and LDLR-WT were similar in levels of cell surface and total receptor and bound equally well to LDL or extracellular PCSK9, the LDLR-R410S was resistant to exogenous PCSK9-mediated degradation in endosomes/lysosomes and showed reduced LDL internalization and degradation relative to LDLR-WT. Evidence is provided for a tighter association of LDL with LDLR-R410S at acidic pH, a reduced LDL delivery to late endosomes/lysosomes, and an increased release in the medium of the bound/internalized LDL, as compared with LDLR-WT.

Open table in a new tab Complete loss of PCSK9 resulted in an unprecedented decrease in LDLc without apparent adverse effects, leading to the development of potent inhibitory PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Large scale phase III clinical trials revealed that subcutaneous injection of these mAbs every 2 or 4 weeks results in ∼60% lowering of LDLc (23Stein E.A. Raal F.

A suspected homozygote FH patient, referred to our Institut de Recherches Cliniques de Montréal (IRCM) lipid clinic in 2010, exhibited highly elevated LDLc despite maximal statin, ezetimibe, and PCSK9 inhibitor therapies. Genetic testing revealed the presence of two heterozygote mutations, R410S and G592E, one on each allele of the LDLR gene. Such mutations were previously reported individually and predicted to be damaging (7Hobbs H.H. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L.

However, the R410S/G592E compound heterozygosity is novel. The underlying mechanisms of these two mutations are unknown, including the patient's resistance to PCSK9-mAb treatment. Therefore, our work sought to (i) identify the mechanism(s) by which the mutations R410S and G592E in the LDLR lead to hypercholesterolemia, as observed in our patient, and (ii) explain the patient's resistance to the PCSK9-mAb treatment, which would point to an alternative therapy for PCSK9-resistant patients. Herein, we provide evidence for a novel FH mechanism associated with LDLR-R410S, the latter representing a new class 8 LDLR mutation (Table 1), and we show that the LDLR-G592E does not effectively exit from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), classifying it as a class 2b LDLR defect. The prepositus, a 23-year-old man, was referred to the IRCM clinic for elevated LDLc and total cholesterol (Table 2). He had normal triglycerides and high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels, normal blood pressure, and no prior history of cardiovascular disease but presented bilateral xanthelasma of the eyelids without tendinous xanthoma. A diagnosis of homozygous FH was proposed based on high LDLc, a positive family history for hypercholesterolemia in both parents, and his poor response to statin therapy. Indeed, atorvastatin (10 mg) led to a modest 13% drop in LDLc compared with an expected ∼35% decrease, and 20 mg resulted in an additional 6% decrease (Fig. 2A). The patient was then switched to rosuvastatin (20 and 40 mg) and ezetimibe (10 mg) therapy, leading to a limited ∼37% reduction in LDLc compared with an expected ∼70% (27Lind S. Olsson A.G. Eriksson M. Rudling M. Eggertsen G. Angelin B. Autosomal recessive hypercholesterolaemia: normalization of plasma LDL cholesterol by ezetimibe in combination with statin treatment.J. Intern. Med. 2004; 256: 406-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Additional subcutaneous injections of 140 mg of the PCSK9-mAb Evolocumab every 2 weeks further lowered LDLc by only ∼15% (expected average 50–70%) (24Seidah N.G. Awan Z. Chrétien M. Mbikay M.

Genetic analysis of the kindred revealed that the R410S and G592E mutations were inherited through the maternal and paternal lineage, respectively (Fig. 2B). Both Arg410 and Gly592 are fully conserved residues among species (data not shown) and are localized in the β-propeller domain of the LDLR, namely Arg410 in the β1 repeat and Gly592 in the β5 one (Fig. 1B). Although the LDLR mutations R410S and G592E were previously reported, their compound heterozygosity, as in our FH patient, is new. For example, the combined heterozygote mutation, R410S on one allele and a deletion mutation on the other allele, was reported in 2013 in an 8-year-old FH patient (26Bertolini S. Pisciotta L. Rabacchi C. Cefalù A.B. Noto D. Fasano T. Signori A. Fresa R. Averna M. Calandra S. Spectrum of mutations and phenotypic expression in patients with autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia identified in Italy.Atherosclerosis. 2013; 227: 342-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Although the early termination deletion mutant is expected to result in an LDLR-defective form, the consequence of the R410S mutation was not analyzed but was predicted to be pathogenic. The heterozygote G592E mutation was previously found either alone or in combination with other LOF mutations on the other allele (29Huijgen R. Kindt I. Defesche J.C. Kastelein J.J. Cardiovascular risk in relation to functionality of sequence variants in the gene coding for the low density lipoprotein receptor: a study among 29,365 individuals tested for 64 specific low density lipoprotein-receptor sequence variants.Eur. Heart J. 2012; 33: 2325-2330Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). It resulted in 5–15% residual LDLR activity in fibroblasts and was predicted to be damaging (7Hobbs H.H. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Molecular genetics of the LDL receptor gene in familial hypercholesterolemia.Hum. Mutat. 1992; 1: 445-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). Table 2 summarizes the characteristics of the subjects who participated in our study. Patients with the single LDLR mutation G592E (WT/G592E) displayed an elevated LDLc, similar to values reported in carriers of this mutation (7Hobbs H.H. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Molecular genetics of the LDL receptor gene in familial hypercholesterolemia.Hum. Mutat. 1992; 1: 445-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). Carriers of the single R410S mutation (R410S/WT) presented LDLc concentrations comparable with those with the single G592E mutation. The compound heterozygote patient (R410S/G592E) exhibited LDLc levels twice higher than subjects with a single mutation. A segregation analysis revealed a genotype-to-phenotype correlation in the studied family pedigree, suggesting that the LDLR mutations R410S and G592E, individually or combined, are causative of FH, without affecting circulating PCSK9 levels that were in the normal range (Table 2) (30Awan Z. Seidah N.G. MacFadyen J.G. Benjannet S. Chasman D.I. Ridker P.M. Genest J. Rosuvastatin, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 concentrations, and LDL cholesterol response: the JUPITER trial.Clin. Chem. 2012; 58: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Moreover, the underlying mechanisms of their effects on LDLR trafficking and their functional consequences in the development of FH are unknown. Accordingly, we first compared the cellular properties of the LDLR mutants with that of LDLR-WT (Fig. 3). Note that on Western blottings (WB) the LDLR appears as a doublet consisting of an LDLR that is not O-glycosylated (∼110 kDa) and one that is fully mature and O-glycosylated (∼140 kDa) (31Pedersen N.B. Wang S. Narimatsu Y. Yang Z. Halim A. Schjoldager K.T. Madsen T.D. Seidah N.G. Bennett E.P. Levery S.B. Clausen H. Low density lipoprotein receptor class A repeats are O-glycosylated in linker regions.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 17312-17324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Thus, WB analyses of overexpressed LDLR-WT, -R410S, and -G592E and both mutants in HEK293 cells revealed that LDLR-WT and LDLR-R410S levels were similar, whereas those of LDLR-G592E were ∼30% of WT, and the equal combination R410S/G592E resulted in an intermediate ∼70% total LDLR protein level (Fig. 3A). This suggests that, different from the WT and R410S receptors, LDLR-G592E is less stable in these cells. We propose that the lower protein levels of this mutant are due to its retention in the ER, as evidenced by its endoglycosidase H sensitivity (Fig. 3B), and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Indeed, the LDLR-G592E levels were increased by ∼2-fold in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (32Lee D.H. Goldberg A.L. Proteasome inhibitors: valuable new tools for cell biologists.Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 397-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1242) Google Scholar), although this agent had little effect on LDLR-WT and LDLR-R410S (Fig. 3C). Whether the proteasomal degradation of the immature G592E receptor follows its ubiquitination or not is unknown. Finally, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis of the LDLR confirmed that WT and R410S cell surface levels were similar, whereas those of G592E and R410S/G592E were ∼40 and ∼70% of WT (Fig. 3D). Similar observations were found in liver-derived HepG2 cells using immunocytochemistry of the LDLR and its mutants (Fig. 3E) under permeabilized (total LDLR; upper panel) and non-permeabilized (cell surface LDLR; lower panel) conditions. The data showed that the cellular LDLR distribution/localization of LDLR-WT and LDLR-R410S was similar in both conditions. Conversely, G592E and the double mutant resulted in decreased cell surface LDLR levels, with an estimated ∼30% (G592E-LDLR) and ∼60% (R410S/G592E-LDLR) reaching the plasma membrane, as compared with WT-LDLR (Fig. 3E). In conclusion, the cell surface expression of LDLR-G592E was drastically reduced compared with WT, mainly because of its retention in ER and subsequent degradation. This should result in increased circulating LDLc levels, as observed in all family members that carried the G592E mutation (Table 2). The cell surface expression of LDLR-WT and LDLR-R410S was similar and much higher than that of LDLR-G592E. However, individuals carrying a single R410S or G592E mutation presented equally increased LDLc levels (5.3–5.9 versus normal 3.4 mmol/liter). This raises the question of the functional activity of the LDLR-R410S and its regulation by PCSK9. It is a rare event to find hypercholesterolemic individuals resistant to the LDLc-lowering effect of a PCSK9-mAbs. In the present FH patient the circulating levels of PCSK9 were within normal range (∼82 ng/ml; Table 2). This eliminated the likelihood that the patient's resistance to PCSK9-mAbs is due to abnormally elevated levels of circulating PCSK9. We thus investigated the possibility that the LDLR-R410S is inadequately responding to PCSK9-enhanced LDLR degradation. We reported that in cell lines PCSK9 enhances the degradation of the LDLR both by an intracellular pathway (Golgi to lysosomes, observed upon co-expression of PCSK9 and LDLR), and an extracellular one (early endosomes to lysosomes, observed upon incubation of cells with exogenous PCSK9) (33Poirier S. Mayer G. Poupon V. McPherson P.S. Desjardins R. Ly K. Asselin M.C. Day R. Duclos F.J. Witmer M. Parker R. Prat A. Seidah N.G.

Chem. 2009; 284: 28856-28864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Accordingly, co-expression of PCSK9-WT or its GOF mutant D374Y with LDLR-WT or LDLR-R410S in HEK293 cells followed by WB analyses revealed that LDLR-WT and LDLR-R410S are ≥90% degraded (Fig. 4A). Similar results were obtained by FACS analysis of cell surface LDLR levels (Fig. 4B). Thus, we conclude that the LDLR mutation R410S does not prevent PCSK9 from dragging the receptor toward lysosomal degradation in the intracellular pathway (33Poirier S. Mayer G. Poupon V. McPherson P.S. Desjardins R. Ly K. Asselin M.C. Day R. Duclos F.J. Witmer M. Parker R. Prat A. Seidah N.G.

Chem. 2009; 284: 28856-28864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). However, because the latter pathway is not predominant in liver, where PCSK9 acts mostly extracellularly on hepatocytes, we next examined the effect of exogenously added PCSK9 on cellular LDLR. Unexpectedly, although extracellular PCSK9-WT or PCSK9-D374Y could enhance the degradation of LDLR-WT (by 50 or 60%, respectively), LDLR-R410S was resistant to the activity of either PCSK9 isoform, as observed by WB (Fig. 4C), or FACS (Fig. 4D) analyses. Finally, we confirmed the above observations with exogenous PCSK9 in mouse primary hepatocytes isolated from mice lacking both PCSK9 and LDLR (34Denis M. Marcinkiewicz J. Zaid A. Gauthier D.

https://openalex.org/W2561386288,"This paper presents a novel approach to incorporate the non-stationarities characterised in the GCM outputs, into the Predictor-Predictand Relationships (PPRs) in statistical downscaling models. In this approach, a series of 42 PPRs based on multi-linear regression (MLR) technique were determined for each calendar month using a 20-year moving window moved at a 1-year time step on the predictor data obtained from the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data archive and observations of precipitation at 3 stations located in Victoria, Australia, for the period 1950–2010. Then the relationships between the constants and coefficients in the PPRs and the statistics of reanalysis data of predictors were determined for the period 1950–2010, for each calendar month. Thereafter, using these relationships with the statistics of the past data of HadCM3 GCM pertaining to the predictors, new PPRs were derived for the periods 1950–69, 1970–89 and 1990–99 for each station. This process yielded a non-stationary downscaling model consisting of a PPR per calendar month for each of the above three periods for each station. The non-stationarities in the climate are characterised by the long-term changes in the statistics of the climate variables and above process enabled relating the non-stationarities in the climate to the PPRs. These new PPRs were then used with the past data of HadCM3, to reproduce the observed precipitation. It was found that the non-stationary MLR based downscaling model was able to produce more accurate simulations of observed precipitation more often than conventional stationary downscaling models developed with MLR and Genetic Programming (GP)."
https://openalex.org/W2566199234,"The interaction of glutamate and dopamine in the striatum is heavily dependent on signaling pathways that converge on the regulatory protein DARPP-32. The efficacy of dopamine/D1 receptor/PKA signaling is regulated by DARPP-32 phosphorylated at Thr-34 (the PKA site), a process that inhibits protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and potentiates PKA action. Activation of dopamine/D1 receptor/PKA signaling also leads to dephosphorylation of DARPP-32 at Ser-97 (the CK2 site), leading to localization of phospho-Thr-34 DARPP-32 in the nucleus where it also inhibits PP1. In this study the role of glutamate in the regulation of DARPP-32 phosphorylation at four major sites was further investigated. Experiments using striatal slices revealed that glutamate decreased the phosphorylation states of DARPP-32 at Ser-97 as well as Thr-34, Thr-75, and Ser-130 by activating NMDA or AMPA receptors in both direct and indirect pathway striatal neurons. The effect of glutamate in decreasing Ser-97 phosphorylation was mediated by activation of PP2A. In vitro phosphatase assays indicated that the PP2A/PR72 heterotrimer complex was likely responsible for glutamate/Ca2+-regulated dephosphorylation of DARPP-32 at Ser-97. As a consequence of Ser-97 dephosphorylation, glutamate induced the nuclear localization in cultured striatal neurons of dephospho-Thr-34/dephospho-Ser-97 DARPP-32. It also reduced PKA-dependent DARPP-32 signaling in slices and in vivo. Taken together, the results suggest that by inducing dephosphorylation of DARPP-32 at Ser-97 and altering its cytonuclear distribution, glutamate may counteract dopamine/D1 receptor/PKA signaling at multiple cellular levels. The interaction of glutamate and dopamine in the striatum is heavily dependent on signaling pathways that converge on the regulatory protein DARPP-32. The efficacy of dopamine/D1 receptor/PKA signaling is regulated by DARPP-32 phosphorylated at Thr-34 (the PKA site), a process that inhibits protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and potentiates PKA action. Activation of dopamine/D1 receptor/PKA signaling also leads to dephosphorylation of DARPP-32 at Ser-97 (the CK2 site), leading to localization of phospho-Thr-34 DARPP-32 in the nucleus where it also inhibits PP1.

DARPP-32 is phosphorylated at Thr-34 by PKA, converting it into a potent inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1). 4The abbreviations used are: PP1protein phosphatase 1Cdk5cyclin-dependent kinase 5ANOVAanalysis of varianceEGFPenhanced GFPNAcnucleus accumbensBis-Tris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diolIPimmunoprecipitation. Thus, when PKA is activated in striatal neurons, the combined inhibition of PP1 increases the phosphorylation of substrates for both PKA and PP1. These substrates include various neurotransmitter receptors (e.g. AMPA GluR1 subunit, NMDA NR1 subunit, and GABAA β1/β2 subunits), ion channels (e.g. L/N/P-type Ca2+ channels, and Na+ channel), Na+,K+-ATPase, and transcription factors (e.g. CREB (cAMP-response element-binding protein)), leading to regulation of excitability and gene expression (e.g. c-Fos, ΔfosB, Zif-268). protein phosphatase 1 cyclin-dependent kinase 5 analysis of variance enhanced GFP nucleus accumbens 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol immunoprecipitation. In addition to PKA, DARPP-32 is phosphorylated at other sites by several other protein kinases. A large number of studies suggest that the states of phosphorylation of the various sites in DARPP-32 are regulated by the balance of the activities of the relevant kinases and phosphatases (1Greengard P.

Phosphorylation of DARPP-32 at Thr-75 by Cdk5 causes inhibition of PKA (5Bibb J.A. Snyder G.L. Nishi A. Yan Z. Meijer L. Fienberg A.A. Tsai L.H. Kwon Y.T. Girault J.A. Czernik A.J. Huganir R.L.

However, when dopamine D1 receptor/PKA signaling is activated, phospho-Thr-75 DARPP-32 is dephosphorylated via activation of PP2A/B56δ, resulting in de-inhibition of PKA and further amplification of dopamine D1 signaling (6Nishi A.

Notably, PKA activation also induces dephosphorylation of DARPP-32 at Ser-97 by PP2A/B56δ, resulting in nuclear accumulation of phospho-Thr-34/dephospho-Ser-97 DARPP-32, leading to PP1 inhibition in the nucleus, histone H3 phosphorylation, and transcriptional activation (10Stipanovich A.

Earlier studies in striatal slices found that calcineurin (PP2B) mediates certain Ca2+-dependent actions of glutamate to counteract dopamine D1 receptor/PKA/DARPP-32 signaling by dephosphorylating DARPP-32 at Thr-34 (12Nishi A.

Activation of NMDA receptors induced dephosphorylation of DARPP-32 in rat striatal slices.Nature. 1990; 343: 369-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). However, subsequent studies found that the actions of glutamate on DARPP-32 phosphorylation are complex. In vivo, glutamate and dopamine can act in a synergistic, coincident manner to activate the ERK MAP kinase pathway (14Girault J.A. Valjent E. Caboche J. Hervé D. ERK2: a logical AND gate critical for drug-induced plasticity?.Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2007; 7: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). In striatal slices, glutamate can induce a rapid increase in Thr-34 phosphorylation via activation of NMDA/AMPA receptor and mGluR5/neuronal NOS/NO/cGMP/PKG signaling that is then followed by a decrease in Thr-34 phosphorylation via activation of NMDA/AMPA receptor/intracellular Ca2+/calcineurin signaling (13Halpain S.

Neurochem. 2002; 81: 832-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Thus, glutamate modulates cytoplasmic dopamine D1 receptor/DARPP-32 signaling in both negative and positive directions via activation of NMDA/AMPA receptor and mGluR signaling. However, it is not known how glutamate affects the phosphorylation state of DARPP-32 at Ser-97 nor how it modulates the localization and function of DARPP-32 in the nucleus. In this study we first characterized the glutamate-induced phosphorylation profile of DARPP-32 including Ser-97 in striatal slices and then investigated the role of glutamate in the regulation of DARPP-32 nuclear translocation. The results suggest that glutamate-dependent dephosphorylation of Ser-97 can lead to nuclear sequestration of an inactive form of DARPP-32 and highlights the existence of multiple modes of DARPP-32 regulation by which glutamate can oppose dopamine signaling. Although we have previously carried out detailed studies of the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of DARPP-32, the conditions varied between the various experiments and focused largely on Thr-34 and Thr-75. To obtain a comprehensive profile of the regulation of DARPP-32 phosphorylation at all sites under the same conditions, we first carried out a parallel analysis of the effects of glutamate in striatal slices (Fig. 1). Treatment of striatal slices with glutamate (5 mm) rapidly and transiently increased DARPP-32 Thr-34 phosphorylation at 15 s of incubation (Fig. 1A), presumably due to activation of neuronal NOS/NO/cGMP/PKG signaling (15Nishi A. Watanabe Y. Higashi H. Tanaka M. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. Glutamate regulation of DARPP-32 phosphorylation in neostriatal neurons involves activation of multiple signaling cascades.Proc. Natl. Acad.

Glutamate subsequently decreased Thr-34 phosphorylation below the basal level at 2 and 5 min of incubation due to activation of calcineurin (15Nishi A. Watanabe Y. Higashi H. Tanaka M. Nairn A.C.

Treatment with glutamate decreased DARPP-32 Thr-75 phosphorylation at 2 and 5 min of incubation (Fig. 1B). The decrease is likely mediated through dephosphorylation of Thr-75 by Ca2+-activated PP2A/PR72 (15Nishi A. Watanabe Y. Higashi H. Tanaka M. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. Glutamate regulation of DARPP-32 phosphorylation in neostriatal neurons involves activation of multiple signaling cascades.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Treatment with glutamate also decreased DARPP-32 Ser-97 phosphorylation to ∼50% of control by 2 min of incubation, and further decreased phosphorylation to 20% of control at 10 min of incubation (Fig. 1C). Glutamate also decreased DARPP-32 Ser-130 phosphorylation after 10 min of incubation, but the decrease (50% of control) was less than for Ser-97 (Fig. 1D). To compare the phosphorylation profiles of DARPP-32 after activation of glutamate/Ca2+ and PKA signaling, we also examined the effects on DARPP-32 phosphorylation of forskolin, which activates adenylyl cyclase and thus stimulates PKA (Fig. 1, E–H). Treatment of striatal slices with forskolin (1 μm) increased DARPP-32 Thr-34 phosphorylation by 8-fold at 10 min of incubation (Fig. 1E). In contrast, forskolin decreased Thr-75 and Ser-97 phosphorylation (Fig. 1, F and G) presumably due to activation of dephosphorylation by PP2A/B56δ (6Nishi A. Bibb J.A. Snyder G.L. Higashi H.

Forskolin did not affect the levels of phospho-Ser-130 DARPP-32 (Fig. 1H), suggesting that CK1 kinase activity is not modulated by PKA and that phospho-Ser-130 DARPP-32 is not a substrate for PP2A/B56δ, in agreement with previous reports indicating the role of PP2C in neurons (21Desdouits F. Siciliano J.C. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. Girault J.A. Dephosphorylation of Ser-137 in DARPP-32 by protein phosphatases 2A and 2C: different roles in vitro and in striatonigral neurons.Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Thus, activation of glutamate/Ca2+ signaling and PKA signaling results in distinct profiles of DARPP-32 phosphorylation (see also the model shown below in Fig. 10A). Treatment of striatal slices with an NMDA receptor agonist, NMDA (100 μm), decreased DARPP-32 phosphorylation at all sites: after 2 min at Thr-34, Thr-75, and Ser-97 and after 10 min at Ser-130 (Fig. 1, I–L). The NMDA-induced decreases in the phosphorylation at the four sites were blocked by NMDA receptor antagonists, MK801 (100 μm) and AP5 (100 μm) (data not shown). The rapid increases in phosphorylation at the four sites, observed at 15 s of incubation with NMDA, were relatively small and were significant only at Ser-97. Treatment with an AMPA receptor agonist, AMPA (100 μm), also decreased DARPP-32 phosphorylation at the four sites (Fig. 1, M–P). AMPA also induced the rapid increase in Thr-34 phosphorylation at 15 and 30 s of incubation, as observed with glutamate treatment (Fig. 1A). The AMPA-induced decreases in the phosphorylation at the four sites were prevented by an AMPA receptor antagonist, NBQX (20–100 μm) (data not shown). The effects of glutamate (5 mm) were examined in the presence of an NMDA receptor antagonist (MK801) plus an AMPA receptor antagonist (CNQX) (Fig. 2, A and B) or an mGluR5 antagonist (MPEP) plus an mGluR1 antagonist (LY367385) (Fig. 2, C and D). In striatal slices pretreated with MK801 plus CNQX, glutamate had no effect on Ser-97 phosphorylation but increased Ser-130 phosphorylation. In contrast, pretreatment with MPEP plus LY367385 did not affect the glutamate-induced dephosphorylation of Ser-97 or Ser-130. Together the results suggest that glutamate induces the decrease in DARPP-32 Ser-97 phosphorylation via activation of NMDA or AMPA receptors. Regarding Ser-130, glutamate likely induces the decrease in DARPP-32 Ser-130 phosphorylation via activation of NMDA or AMPA receptors and the increase in Ser-130 phosphorylation via activation of mGluR5 or mGluR1, which is supported by our previous study showing group I mGluRs (mGluR5 and mGluR1)-induced Ser-130 phosphorylation via activation of CK1 (17Liu F. Ma X.H. Ule J. Bibb J.A. Nishi A. DeMaggio A.J. Yan Z. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. Regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 and casein kinase 1 by metabotropic glutamate receptors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 11062-11068Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The NMDA- or AMPA-induced decreases in DARPP-32 phosphorylation at the four sites are presumably mediated through an increase in intracellular Ca2+. We examined whether depolarization with a high concentration of KCl mimicked the effects of NMDA and AMPA. Treatment with KCl (40 mm) decreased the phosphorylation of DARPP-32 at each of the four sites (Fig. 1, Q–T) similarly to NMDA or AMPA treatment, supporting the conclusion that Ca2+-dependent mechanisms are involved in the decreases in phosphorylation mediated by glutamate. The effects of a PP2A inhibitor, okadaic acid, on the AMPA-induced decrease in DARPP-32 phosphorylation were examined (Fig. 3, A–D). Okadaic acid alone (1, 3, and 10 μm) increased the levels of phosphorylated DARPP-32 at each of the four sites. Preincubation with okadaic acid did not attenuate the effects of AMPA on phospho-Thr-34 DARPP-32 but attenuated or abolished the AMPA-induced decreases in Thr-75 and Ser-130 phosphorylation. Although okadaic acid at 1 and 3 μm failed to attenuate the effects of AMPA on Ser-97 phosphorylation, at a higher concentration (10 μm) it attenuated the effects of AMPA. Okadaic acid alone at 1 and 3 μm increased Ser-97 phosphorylation, but this effect was less pronounced and not significant at 10 μm. An inhibitor of calcineurin, cyclosporin A, increased the basal levels of phospho-Thr-34 DARPP-32 and attenuated the effect of AMPA on Thr-34 phosphorylation, whereas it did not affect the basal levels of phospho-Thr-75, Ser-97, or Ser-130 or the AMPA-induced decreases in the phosphorylation of these residues (data not shown). Analyses of dose responsiveness to AMPA revealed that phospho-Ser-97 was sensitive to lower concentrations of AMPA compared with the other sites (Fig. 3, E–H). AMPA decreased DARPP-32 phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner, with half-maximal effects at ∼2 μm for Thr-34, Thr-75, and Ser-130 and at ∼0.7 μm for Ser-97. AMPA at high concentrations (10 and 100 μm) decreased the levels of phospho-Thr-34, Thr-75, and Ser-130 to 40–50% that of control, but the level of phospho-Ser-97 was reduced to <10% of control at these concentrations. These results suggest that the dephosphorylation machinery for Ser-97 is more sensitive to AMPA compared with the other DARPP-32 sites. The effect of AMPA on Thr-34 dephosphorylation is likely mediated through activation of calcineurin, whereas those on Thr-75 and Ser-130 dephosphorylation most likely involve PP2A. Interestingly, Ser-97 dephosphorylation can clearly be mediated by PP2A based on the basal effect of okadaic acid. However, AMPA-induced Ser-97 dephosphorylation is much less sensitive to okadaic acid compared with the other two PP2A sites, Thr-75 and Ser-130. Taken together these results suggest some differences in the detailed mechanisms involved in PP2A actions on DARPP-32 depending on the target phosphorylated residues. We next examined whether activation of NMDA or AMPA receptors decreased DARPP-32 phosphorylation in D1 receptor-enriched striatonigral and/or D2 receptor-enriched striatopallidal neurons using striatal slices from D1-DARPP-32-FLAG/D2-DARPP-32-Myc mice (22Bateup H.S.

https://openalex.org/W2569108583,"Nowadays, chaos generators are an attractive field for research and the challenge is their realization for the development of engineering applications. From more than three decades ago, chaotic oscillators have been designed using discrete electronic devices, very few with integrated circuit technology, and in this work we propose the use of field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) for fast prototyping. FPGA-based applications require that one be expert on programming with very-high-speed integrated circuits hardware description language (VHDL). In this manner, we detail the VHDL descriptions of chaos generators for fast prototyping from high-level programming using Python. The cases of study are three kinds of chaos generators based on piecewise-linear (PWL) functions that can be systematically augmented to generate even and odd number of scrolls. We introduce new algorithms for the VHDL description of PWL functions like saturated functions series, negative slopes and sawtooth. The generated VHDL-code is portable, reusable and open source to be synthesized in an FPGA. Finally, we show experimental results for observing 2, 10 and 30-scroll attractors."
https://openalex.org/W2567215372,"Enlarged vestibular aqueduct (EVA) is one of the most common congenital inner ear malformations and accounts for 1–12% of sensorineural deafness in children and adolescents. Multiple genetic defects contribute to EVA; therefore, early molecular diagnosis is critical for EVA patients to ensure that the most effective treatment strategies are employed. This study explored a new genetic diagnosis method for EVA and applied it to clinic diagnoses of EVA patients. Using next-generation sequencing technology, we set up a multiple polymerase chain reaction enrichment system for target regions of EVA pathogenic genes (SLC26A4, FOXI1, and KCNJ10). Forty-six EVA samples were sequenced by this system. Variants were detected in 87.0% (40/46) of cases, including three novel variants (SLC26A4 c.923_929del, c.1002-8C>G, and FOXI1 c.519C>A). Biallelic potential pathogenic variants were detected in 27/46 patient samples, leading to a purported diagnostic rate of 59%. All results were verified by Sanger sequencing. Our target region capture system was validated to amplify and measure SLC26A4, FOXI1, and KCNJ10 in one reaction system. The result supplemented the mutation spectrum of EVA. Thus, this strategy is an economic, rapid, accurate, and reliable method with many useful applications in the clinical diagnosis of EVA patients."

In this study, a water soluble polysaccharide, which we designated as UP2, with an average molecular weight of 3.33 × 105 Da, was isolated from U. esculenta cultivated in the Huangshan Mountain, by consecutive hot water extraction and anion-exchange chromatography. Gas chromatography analysis indicated that UP2 contained three kinds of monosaccharides, including mannose, glucose, and galactose at a molar ratio of 1.7:1.0:1.2. Linkage analysis of UP2 revealed the presence of (1 → 6)-linked glucosyl, (1 → 3,6)-linked glucosyl, t-linked galactosyl, (1 → 6)-linked galactosyl and (1 → 6)-linked mannosyl at a molar ratio of 0.7:4.6:4.1:2.2:9.1. Structural analysis determined that UP2 possessed a backbone consisting of (1 → 6)-linked β-D-glucopyranosyl and (1 → 6)-linked α-D-mannopyranosyl residues, which substituted at the O-3 position of (1 → 6)-linked β-D-glucopyranosyl residues by branches of (1 → 6)-linked α-D-galactopyranosyl and 1-linked β-D-galactopyranosyl residues. Immunostimulatory activity analysis showed that UP2 could stimulate the proliferation of RAW264.7 cells in a dose-dependent manner, and all the samples (20–500 μg/mL) were found to enhance nitric oxide production. The highest phagocytic activity of UP2 was observed at 200 μg/mL. Thus, UP2 may be a potential source of biological and pharmacological agents."
https://openalex.org/W2564486553,"Tardigrades belong to the most radiation tolerant animals on Earth, as documented by a number of studies using both low-LET and high-LET ionizing radiation. Previous studies have focused on semi-terrestrial species, which are also very tolerant to desiccation. The predominant view on the reason for the high radiation tolerance among these semi-terrestrial species is that it relies on molecular mechanisms that evolved as adaptations for surviving dehydration. In this study we report the first study on radiation tolerance in a marine tardigrade, Echiniscoides sigismundi. Adult specimens in the hydrated active state were exposed to doses of gamma radiation from 100 to 5000 Gy. The results showed little effect of radiation at 100 and 500 Gy but a clear decline in activity at 1000 Gy and higher. The highest dose survived was 4000 Gy, at which ca. 8% of the tardigrades were active 7 days after irradiation. LD50 in the first 7 days after irradiation was in the range of 1100-1600 Gy. Compared to previous studies on radiation tolerance in semi-terrestrial and limnic tardigrades, Echiniscoides sigismundi seems to have a lower tolerance. However, the species still fits into the category of tardigrades that have high tolerance to both desiccation and radiation, supporting the hypothesis that radiation tolerance is a by-product of adaptive mechanisms to survive desiccation. More studies on radiation tolerance in tardigrade species adapted to permanently wet conditions, both marine and freshwater, are needed to obtain a more comprehensive picture of the patterns of radiation tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W2567496133,"Introduction To quantify the association between PPI use, type and dose and infectious gastroenteritis hospitalization in a population-based cohort of middle-aged and older adults. Methods Prospective study of 38,019 concession card holders followed up over 6 years in the Sax Institute’s 45 and Up Study. Data from the baseline questionnaire were linked to prescription medication, hospitalization, notifiable disease, cancer registry and death datasets from 2006–2012. Associations between PPI use and gastroenteritis hospitalization were examined using Cox regressions with age as the underlying time variable. Results Among 38,019 participants, the median age was 69.7 years, and 57.3% were women. Compared to non-users, current PPI users were more likely to be older, and have a higher BMI. During follow-up there were 1,982 incident gastroenteritis hospitalizations (crude rate: 12.9 per 1000 person-years, 95% CI: 12.3–13.5). PPI use was significantly associated with infectious gastroenteritis hospitalization (aHR 1.4, 95% CI: 1.2–1.5). Among current users, a dose-response relationship was observed between the average daily dose (DDD) dispensed per day and infectious gastroenteritis hospitalization (Ptrend<0.001). We also observed higher rates of infectious gastroenteritis hospitalization and greater PPI use among participants with a history of chronic bowel problems (aHR 2.2, 95% CI: 1.9–2.5). There was no difference in risk by type of PPI. Recent use of H2 receptors was not associated with gastroenteritis hospitalization. Conclusion PPI use is associated with an increased risk of infectious gastroenteritis hospitalization. Clinicians should be aware of this risk when considering PPI therapy."

https://openalex.org/W2561669503,"Maize foundation parents (FPs) play no-alternative roles in hybrid breeding because they were widely used in the development of new lines and hybrids. The combination of different identity-by-descent (IBD) segments and genes could account for the formation patterns of different FPs, and knowledge of these IBD regions would provide an extensive foundation for the development of new candidate FP lines in future maize breeding. In this paper, a panel of 304 elite lines derived from FPs, i.e., B73, 207, Mo17, and Huangzaosi (HZS), was collected and analyzed using 43,252 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. Most IBD segments specific to particular FP groups were identified, including 116 IBD segments in B73, 105 in Mo17, 111 in 207, and 190 in HZS. In these regions, 423 quantitative trait nucleotides (QTNs) associated with 15 agronomic traits and 804 candidate genes were identified. Some known adaptation-related genes, e.g., dwarf8 and vgt1 in HZS, zcn8 and epc in Mo17, and ZmCCT in 207, were validated as being tightly linked to particular IBD segments. In addition, numerous new candidate genes were also identified. For example, GRMZM2G154278 in HZS, which belongs to the cell cycle control family, was closely linked to a QTN of the ear height/plant height (EH/PH) trait; GRMZM2G051943 in 207, which encodes an endochitinase precursor (EP) chitinase, was closely linked to a QTN for kernel density; and GRMZM2G170586 in Mo17 was closely linked to a QTN for ear diameter. Complex correlations among these genes were also found. Many IBD segments and genes were included in the formation of FP lines, and complex regulatory networks exist among them. These results provide new insights on the genetic basis of complex traits and provide new candidate IBD regions or genes for the improvement of special traits in maize production."

Mutations in human RecQ4 give rise to three distinct genetic disorders (Rothmund-Thomson, RAPADILINO, and Baller-Gerold syndromes), characterized by genetic instability, growth deficiency, and predisposition to cancer. Previous studies suggested that RecQ4 was unique because it did not seem to contain a RecQ C-terminal region (RQC) found in the other RecQ paralogues; such a region consists of a zinc domain and a winged helix domain and plays an important role in enzyme activity. However, our recent bioinformatic analysis identified in RecQ4 a putative RQC. To experimentally confirm this hypothesis, we report the purification and characterization of the catalytic core of human RecQ4. Inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry detected the unusual presence of two zinc clusters within the zinc domain, consistent with the bioinformatic prediction. Analysis of site-directed mutants, targeting key RQC residues (putative zinc ligands and the aromatic residue predicted to be at the tip of the winged helix β-hairpin), showed a decrease in DNA binding, unwinding, and annealing, as expected for a functional RQC domain. Low resolution structural information obtained by small angle X-ray scattering data suggests that RecQ4 interacts with DNA in a manner similar to RecQ1, whereas the winged helix domain may assume alternative conformations, as seen in the bacterial enzymes.

Despite the significance of Src in suppression of apoptosis, the mechanism of Src-mediated suppression of apoptosis remains poorly understood. In this study we identify Ku70 as a Src substrate involved in apoptosis signaling. Inhibition of the kinase activity of endogenous Src enhances the level of apoptosis upon apoptotic stimulation. Phosphorylation of Ku70 at Tyr-530 by Src inhibits acetylation of Ku70, resulting in suppression of apoptosis. Our results provide the first demonstration of a novel role of Ku70's tyrosine phosphorylation in suppression of apoptosis. We recently performed phosphoproteomic analyses of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in HeLa S3 cells overexpressing the Src-family kinase Lyn (5Kubota S. Fukumoto Y. Aoyama K. Ishibashi K. Yuki R.

Purified tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins using anti-phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P)) antibody were digested with trypsin. We found that the tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides detected by LC/MS/MS contained Ku70, a ubiquitously expressed protein, as a candidate substrate of Src-family kinases. To examine whether Ku70 was actually tyrosine-phosphorylated by Src-family kinases, cells were cotransfected with myc-tagged wild-type Ku70 (myc-Ku70-WT) 5The abbreviations used are: Ku70-WTwild-type Ku70Ku70-YFKu70-Y530F mutantKu70-YEKu70-Y530E mutantKDkinase deadNHEJnon-homologous end joiningADRadriamycinTRtetracycline repressorDoxdoxycyclineROSreactive oxygen speciesNACN-acetylcysteinePKcsprotein kinase catalytic subunitNLSnuclear localization sequence. plus c-Src or myc-Ku70-WT plus c-Src(kinase-dead (KD)) in the presence or absence of the Src inhibitor PP2, and cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation and Western blotting analysis. In fact, myc-Ku70-WT was capable of being tyrosine-phosphorylated by c-Src but not c-Src(KD), and PP2 treatment inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of myc-Ku70-WT (Fig. 1A). Among Lyn, c-Src, and Fyn, expression of c-Src was found to strongly induce tyrosine phosphorylation of Ku70 (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, to test whether Ku70 was a direct substrate of c-Src, we transfected COS-1 cells with myc-Ku70-WT, c-Src, or c-Src(KD), immunoprecipitated each protein, and performed in vitro kinase assays. Tyrosine phosphorylation of myc-Ku70-WT by c-Src was detected in a kinase activity-dependent manner (Fig. 1, C and D).

We generated a Ku70 mutant that has a phenylalanine substitution for Tyr-530 (myc-Ku70-Y530F) (Fig. 2A) and cotransfected COS-1 cells with c-Src plus myc-Ku70-WT or c-Src plus myc-Ku70-Y530F. The level of c-Src-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of myc-Ku70-Y530F was decreased to ∼56% that of myc-Ku70-WT (Fig. 2B). This result suggests that Tyr-530 is one of the major tyrosine phosphorylation sites of Ku70. It is well known that Ku70 majorly forms a heterodimer with Ku80, which is required for repairing DNA double-strand breaks through NHEJ (38Smith G.C. Jackson S.P. The DNA-dependent protein kinase.Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 916-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar, 39Sancar A. Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Unsal-Kaçmaz K. Linn S.

To examine whether tyrosine phosphorylation of Ku70 could associate with NHEJ repair, we analyzed the formation of the Ku70/Ku80 heterodimer by coimmunoprecipitation of myc-Ku70 with FLAG-Ku80. In fact, expression of nucleus-localized Lyn (nuclear-localized sequence-tagged Lyn (NLS-Lyn)) did not affect heterodimerization of Ku70 with Ku80 (Fig. 3, A and B), although Ku70 and Ku80 were both tyrosine-phosphorylated upon NLS-Lyn expression (Fig. 3B). Because the Ku70/Ku80 heterodimer recruits the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) to DNA ends to form the active DNA-PKcs·Ku70/Ku80 complex (38Smith G.C. Jackson S.P.

The phosphorylation levels of DNA-PKcs were not changed by NLS-Lyn expression upon ADR treatment (Fig. 3D). These results suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of Ku70 at Tyr-530 does not appear to associate with NHEJ repair.

To understand the regulation of the ability of Ku70 to suppress apoptosis, we attempted to establish stable Ku70-knockdown cell lines. We first constructed two short-hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting the sequences in the coding sequence (shKu70-CDS) and the 3′-untranslated region (shKu70–3′-UTR) of human Ku70 (see “Experimental Procedures”), and transiently transfected HeLa S3 cells with shKu70-CDS or shKu70–3′-UTR. At 48 h after transfection, Ku70 immunostaining showed that expression of shKu70-CDS greatly decreased the level of endogenous Ku70 compared with that of shKu70–3′-UTR. Nonetheless, the use of shKu70–3′-UTR, but not shKu70-CDS, enabled us to establish stable Ku70-knockdown cell lines (HeLa S3/shKu70) (Fig. 4, A and B), implying that a drastic decrease in endogenous Ku70 expression may affect cell proliferation. This observation is supported by previous studies that no Ku70-null human HCT116 clones were established (49Fattah F.J. Lichter N.F. Fattah K.R. Oh S. Hendrickson E.A. Ku70, an essential gene, modulates the frequency of rAAV-mediated gene targeting in human somatic cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 8703-8708Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Then, using HeLa S3/shKu70 cells, we examined the effect of Ku70 knockdown on UV-induced apoptosis. We treated parental HeLa S3 cells and HeLa S3/shKu70 cells with UV light and measured the percentage of apoptotic cells by staining for cleaved caspase-3 and/or nuclear condensation/fragmentation (Fig. 4C). It was found that Ku70 knockdown potentiated UV-induced apoptosis prominently at low doses of UV (Fig. 4D), in agreement with previous studies (43Cohen H.Y. Lavu S. Bitterman K.J. Hekking B. Imahiyerobo T.A. Miller C. Frye R. Ploegh H. Kessler B.M. Sinclair D.A. Acetylation of the C terminus of Ku70 by CBP and PCAF controls Bax-mediated apoptosis.Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 627-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). A recent study showed that NIH3T3 cells transformed by expression of a temperature-sensitive v-Src mutant were strongly resistant to a variety of apoptosis inducers, including UV light (29Lopez J. Hesling C. Prudent J. Popgeorgiev N. Gadet R. Mikaelian I. Rimokh R. Gillet G. Gonzalo P. Src tyrosine kinase inhibits apoptosis through the Erk1/2-dependent degradation of the death accelerator Bik.Cell Death Differ. 2012; 19: 1459-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To examine the involvement of Src-family tyrosine kinases in UV-induced apoptosis, we treated parental HeLa S3 cells and HeLa S3/shKu70 cells with UV light in the presence or absence of PP2 or SU6656, another Src inhibitor, and found that Src inhibition increased the level of apoptosis in parental HeLa S3 cells prominently at a low dose of UV (Fig. 4E, open bars). These results suggest that the kinase activity of endogenous Src is involved in a reduction in susceptibility to apoptosis. Notably, Src inhibition did not affect the level of apoptosis in Ku70-knockdown cells at low and high doses of UV (Fig. 4E, solid bars). To substantiate that the kinase activity of Src was critical for suppression of apoptosis, parental HeLa S3 cells and HeLa S3/shKu70 cells were transfected with the Src-family kinase c-Src or Lyn and then subjected to UV irradiation. c-Src overexpression significantly suppressed UV-induced apoptosis compared with Lyn (Fig. 4F, open bars). However, c-Src overexpression did not appear to suppress apoptosis in Ku70-knockdown cells under these conditions (Fig. 4F, solid bars). Taken together, these results suggest that Src suppresses UV-induced apoptosis through Ku70. In addition, the level of ADR-induced apoptosis was decreased by inducible expression of c-Src in HeLa S3 cells (Fig. 4G), suggesting that high expression of Src leads to a reduction in susceptibility to apoptosis. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) leads to Src activation (50Giannoni E. Buricchi F. Raugei G. Ramponi G. Chiarugi P.

Redox regulation of protein kinases.FEBS J. 2013; 280: 1944-1965Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), and UV irradiation is thought to increase ROS-dependent Src activity. To examine whether Src-mediated suppression of UV-induced apoptosis through Ku70 was dependent on the production of ROS, we treated parental HeLa S3 cells and Ku70-knockdown cells with UV light in the presence or absence of N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a ROS scavenger. We also treated with ADR, which induces ROS-mediated apoptosis (52Gewirtz D.

In contrast, the levels of UV-induced apoptosis were not affected but rather increased by NAC treatment of HeLa S3 cells or Ku70-knockdown cells (Fig. 4H). These results suggest that Ku70 suppresses UV-induced apoptosis in a ROS-independent manner. To examine whether Src was activated by UV irradiation in our culture conditions, we assessed autophosphorylation levels of endogenous Src by Western blotting wi"
https://openalex.org/W2565042811,"Increasing evidence shows that CC-chemokines promote inflammatory-driven angiogenesis, with little to no effect on hypoxia-mediated angiogenesis. Inhibition of the CC-chemokine class may therefore affect angiogenesis differently depending on the pathophysiological context. We compared the effect of CC-chemokine inhibition in inflammatory and physiological conditions. In vitro, the broad-spectrum CC-chemokine inhibitor ""35K"" inhibited inflammatory-induced endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and tubulogenesis, with more modest effects in hypoxia. In vivo, adenoviruses were used to overexpress 35K (Ad35K) and GFP (AdGFP, control virus). Plasma chemokine activity was suppressed by Ad35K in both models. In the periarterial femoral cuff model of inflammatory-driven angiogenesis, overexpression of 35K inhibited adventitial neovessel formation compared with control AdGFP-infused mice. In contrast, 35K preserved neovascularization in the hindlimb ischemia model and had no effect on physiological neovascularization in the chick chorioallantoic membrane assay. Mechanistically, 2 key angiogenic proteins (VEGF and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α) were conditionally regulated by 35K, such that expression was inhibited in inflammation but was unchanged in hypoxia. In conclusion, CC-chemokine inhibition by 35K suppresses inflammatory-driven angiogenesis while preserving physiological ischemia-mediated angiogenesis via conditional regulation of VEGF and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α. CC-chemokine inhibition may be an alternative therapeutic strategy for suppressing diseases associated with inflammatory angiogenesis without inducing the side effects caused by global inhibition.- Ridiandries, A., Tan, J.

https://openalex.org/W2977530406,"Climate change is expected to alter precipitation patterns. Droughts may become longer and more frequent, and the timing and intensity of precipitation may change. We tested how shifting precipitation patterns, both seasonally and by frequency of events, affects soil nitrogen availability, plant biomass and diversity in a shrub-steppe temperate grassland along a natural productivity gradient in Lac du Bois Grasslands Protected Area near Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada. We manipulated seasonal watering patterns by either exclusively watering in the spring or the fall. To simulate spring precipitation we restricted precipitation inputs in the fall, then added 50% more water than the long term average in the spring, and vice-versa for the fall precipitation treatment. Overall, the amount of precipitation remained roughly the same. We manipulated the frequency of rainfall events by either applying water weekly (frequent) or monthly (intensive). After 2 years, changes in the seasonality of watering had greater effects on plant biomass and diversity than changes in the frequency of watering. Fall watering reduced biomass and increased species diversity, while spring watering had little effect. The reduction in biomass in fall watered treatments was due to a decline in grasses, but not forbs. Plant available N, measured by Plant Root Simulator (PRS)-probes, increased from spring to summer to fall, and was higher in fall watered treatments compared to spring watered treatments when measured in the fall. The only effect observed due to frequency of watering events was greater extractable soil N in monthly applied treatments compared to weekly watering treatments. Understanding the effects of changing precipitation patterns on grasslands will allow improved grassland conservation and management in the face of global climatic change, and here we show that if precipitation is more abundant in the fall, compared to the spring, grassland primary productivity will likely be negatively affected."
https://openalex.org/W2561843854,"Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is the major source of lipid within atherosclerotic lesions. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is present in lesions and forms the reactive oxidants hypochlorous acid (HOCl) and hypothiocyanous acid (HOSCN). These oxidants modify LDL and have been strongly linked with the development of atherosclerosis. In this study, we examined the effect of HOCl, HOSCN and LDL pre-treated with these oxidants on the function of lysosomal enzymes responsible for protein catabolism and lipid hydrolysis in murine macrophage-like J774A.1 cells. In each case, the cells were exposed to HOCl or HOSCN or LDL pre-treated with these oxidants. Lysosomal cathepsin (B, L and D) and acid lipase activities were quantified, with cathepsin and LAMP-1 protein levels determined by Western blotting. Exposure of J774A.1 cells to HOCl or HOSCN resulted in a significant decrease in the activity of the Cys-dependent cathepsins B and L, but not the Asp-dependent cathepsin D. Cathepsins B and L were also inhibited in macrophages exposed to HOSCN-modified, and to a lesser extent, HOCl-modified LDL. No change was seen in cathepsin D activity or the expression of the cathepsin proteins or lysosomal marker protein LAMP-1. The activity of lysosomal acid lipase was also decreased on treatment of macrophages with each modified LDL. Taken together, these results suggest that HOCl, HOSCN and LDL modified by these oxidants could contribute to lysosomal dysfunction and thus perturb the cellular processing of LDL, which could be important during the development of atherosclerosis."

Knockout of the laminin-α4 gene (lama4) does not alter gross NMJ morpho-genesis. However, mice deficient in laminin-α4 (lama4−/− mice) display disruptions in the alignment of the active zones and postsynaptic folds at the NMJ, although the physiological consequences of this loss have not been examined. The present study investigated the differences in neurotransmission during the early development and maturation of the NMJ in lama4−/− and wild-type mice. Lama4−/− NMJs demonstrated a decrease in miniature end-plate potential (EPP) frequency and increased amplitude of miniature EPPs and evoked EPPs. Binomial parameters analysis of neurotransmitter release revealed a decrease in quantal release, the result of a decrease in the number of active release sites, but not in the probability of transmitter release. Lama4−/− NMJs displayed higher levels of synaptic depression under high-frequency stimulation and altered facilitation, suggesting compromised delivery of synaptic vesicles. This idea is supported by our molecular investigations of lama4−/− NMJs, where we see altered distribution of Bassoon, a molecular component of active zones, presumably resulting from perturbed neurotransmission. —Chand, K.

https://openalex.org/W2567470553,"Phrasing facilitates the organization of auditory information and is central to speech and music. Not surprisingly, aspects of changing intensity, rhythm, and pitch are key determinants of musical phrases and their boundaries in instrumental note-based music. Different kinds of speech (such as tone- vs. stress-languages) share these features in different proportions and form an instructive comparison. However, little is known about whether or how musical phrasing is perceived in sound-based music, where the basic musical unit from which a piece is created is commonly non-instrumental continuous sounds, rather than instrumental discontinuous notes. This issue forms the target of the present paper. Twenty participants (17 untrained in music) were presented with six stimuli derived from sound-based music, note-based music, and environmental sound. Their task was to indicate each occurrence of a perceived phrase and qualitatively describe key characteristics of the stimulus associated with each phrase response. It was hypothesized that sound-based music does elicit phrase perception, and that this is primarily associated with temporal changes in intensity and timbre, rather than rhythm and pitch. Results supported this hypothesis. Qualitative analysis of participant descriptions showed that for sound-based music, the majority of perceived phrases were associated with intensity or timbral change. For the note-based piano piece, rhythm was the main theme associated with perceived musical phrasing. We modeled the occurrence in time of perceived musical phrases with recurrent event ‘hazard’ analyses using time-series data representing acoustic predictors associated with intensity, spectral flatness, and rhythmic density. Acoustic intensity and timbre (represented here by spectral flatness) were strong predictors of perceived musical phrasing in sound-based music, and rhythm was only predictive for the piano piece. A further analysis including five additional spectral measures linked to timbre strengthened the models. Overall, results show that even when little of the pitch and rhythm information important for phrasing in note-based music is available, phrasing is still perceived, primarily in response to changes of intensity and timbre. Implications for electroacoustic music composition and music recommender systems are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2564397370,"The erythropoietin receptor (EpoR) regulates development of blood cells, and its full activation normally requires the cytokine erythropoietin (Epo). In the case of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), Epo-independent signaling through EpoR can be caused by a point mutation, V617F, in the EpoR-interacting tyrosine kinase Janus kinase 2 (JAK2). In cells expressing the JAK2 V617F mutant, eight tyrosine residues in the intracellular domain of EpoR are phosphorylated, but the functional role of these phosphorylations in oncogenic signaling is incompletely understood. Here, to evaluate the functional consequences of the phosphorylation of these tyrosine residues, we constructed an EpoR-8YF mutant in which we substituted all eight tyrosine residues with phenylalanine. Co-expression of EpoR-8YF with the JAK2 V617F mutant failed to induce cytokine-independent cell proliferation and tumorigenesis, indicating that JAK2-mediated EpoR phosphorylation is the reason for JAK2 V617F mutant-induced oncogenic signaling. An exhaustive mutational analysis of the eight EpoR tyrosine residues indicated that three of these residues, Tyr-343, Tyr-460, and Tyr-464, are required for the JAK2 V617F mutant to exhibit its oncogenic activity. We also showed that phosphorylation at these three residues was necessary for full activation of the transcription factor STAT5, which is a critical downstream factor of JAK2 V617F-induced oncogenic signaling. In contrast, Epo stimulation could moderately stimulate the proliferation of cells expressing wild type JAK2 and EpoR-8YF, suggesting that the requirement of the phosphorylation of these three tyrosine residues seems to be specific for the oncogenic proliferation provoked by V617F mutation. Collectively, these results have revealed that phosphorylation of Tyr-343, Tyr-460, and Tyr-464 in EpoR underlies JAK2 V617F mutant-induced tumorigenesis. We propose that the targeted disruption of this pathway has therapeutic utility for managing MPN."
https://openalex.org/W2568335687,"Antiretroviral therapy has shown to be effective in reducing morbidity and mortality in patients infected with HIV for the past couples of decades. However, there remains a need to better understand the characteristics of long-term treatment outcomes in resource poor settings. The main aim of this study was to determine and compare the long-term response of patients on nevirapine and efavirenz based first line antiretroviral therapy regimen in Ethiopia.Hospital based retrospective cohort study was conducted from January 2009 to December 2013 at University hospital located in Northwest Ethiopia. Human subject research approval for this study was received from University of Gondar Research Ethics Committee and the medical director of the hospital. Cox-proportional hazards model was used to assess the effect of baseline covariates on composite outcome and a semi-parametric mixed effect model was used to investigate CD4 counts response to treatments.A total of 2386 HIV/AIDS naive patients were included in this study. Nearly one-in-four patients experienced the events, of which death, lost to follow up, treatment substitution and discontinuation of Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors(NNRTI) accounted: 99 (26.8%), 122 (33.0%), 137 (37.0%) and 12 (3.2%), respectively. The hazard of composite outcome on nevirapine compared with efavirenz was 1.02(95%CI: 0.52-1.99) with p-value = 0.96. Similarly, the hazard of composite outcome on tenofovir and stavudine compared with zidovudine were 1.87 (95%CI: 1.52-2.32), p-value < 0.0001 and 1.72(95% CI: 1.22-2.32), p-value = 0.002, respectively. The rate of CD4 increase in response to treatment was high during the first 10 months and stabilized later.This study revealed that treatment responses were comparable whether nevirapine or efavirenz was chosen to initiate antiretroviral therapy for HIV/AIDS patients in Ethiopia. There was significant difference on risk of composite outcome between patients who were initiated with Tenofovir containing ART regimen compared with zidovudine after controlling for NNRTI drug combinations."
https://openalex.org/W2561245164,"Knowledge about variables associated with context-specific sitting time in older adults is limited. Therefore, this study explored cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of socio-demographic, social-cognitive, physical-environmental and health-related variables with sitting during TV viewing, computer use and motorized transport in older adults.A sample of Belgian older adults completed structured interviews on context-specific sitting time and associated variables using a longitudinal study design. Objective measurements of grip strength and physical performance were also completed. Complete baseline data were available of 258 participants (73.98±6.16 years) of which 229 participants remained in the study at one year follow-up (retention rate: 91.60%). Cross-sectional correlates (baseline data) and longitudinal predictors (change-scores in relation with change in sitting time) were explored through multiple linear regression analyses.Per context-specific sitting time, most of the cross-sectional correlates differed from the longitudinal predictors. Increases over time in enjoyment of watching TV (+one unit), encouragement of partner to watch less TV (+one unit) and TV time of partner (+30.0 min/day) were associated with respectively 9.1 min/day (p<0.001), 16.0 min/day (p<0.001) and 12.0 min/day (p<0.001) more sitting during TV viewing at follow-up. Increases over time in enjoyment of using a computer (+one unit), the number of smartphones and tablets (+1) and computer use of the partner (+30.0 min/day) were associated with respectively 5.5 min/day (p < .01), 10.4 min/day (p < .05) and 3.0 min/day (p < .05) more sitting during computer use at follow-up. An increase over time in self-efficacy regarding taking a bicycle or walking was associated with 2.9 min/day (p < .05) less sitting during motorized transport at follow-up.The results stressed the importance of looking at separate contexts of sitting. Further, the results highlighted the importance of longitudinal research in order to reveal which changes in particular variables predicted changes in context-specific sitting time. Variables at the social-cognitive level were most frequently related to context-specific sitting."

Since community members influence the willingness of young people to participate in the vaccination trials, ascertaining their opinions is essential to overcoming barriers to such participation. Here, in seven focus group discussions we explored the views of 44 community members identified as someone they felt close by youth in Tanzania. The transcripts of these discussions were examined using content analysis. Our participants expressed that community members would be directly involved in the decisions of young people about whether or not to participate in an HIV vaccine trial. In general, they felt that community members would provide social support for youth during the trial and perceived that youth might have misconceptions concerning the vaccine and trial process. The participants pointed out structural factors such as substance use, poverty, stigma and unemployment that are barriers to participation. In conclusion, involvement of community members could be an integral part of the recruitment and retention of young people in HIV vaccine trials in Tanzania."

https://openalex.org/W2567975392,"Understanding medical students' motivation to select medical studies is particularly salient to inform practice and policymaking in countries-such as India-where shortage of medical personnel poses crucial and chronical challenges to healthcare systems. This study aims to develop and validate a questionnaire to assess the motivation of medical students to select medical studies.A Motivation for Selection of Medical Study (MSMS) questionnaire was developed using extensive literature review followed by Delphi technique. The scale consisted of 12 items, 5 measuring intrinsic dimensions of motivations and 7 measuring extrinsic dimensions. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), validity, reliability and data quality checks were conducted on a sample of 636 medical students from six medical colleges of three North Indian states.The MSMS questionnaire consisted of 3 factors (subscales) and 8 items. The three principal factors that emerged after EFA were the scientific factor (e.g. research opportunities and the ability to use new cutting edge technologies), the societal factor (e.g. job security) and the humanitarian factor (e.g. desire to help others). The CFA conducted showed goodness-of-fit indices supporting the 3-factor model.The three extracted factors cut across the traditional dichotomy between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation and uncover a novel three-faceted motivation construct based on scientific factors, societal expectations and humanitarian needs. This validated instrument can be used to evaluate the motivational factors of medical students to choose medical study in India and similar settings and constitutes a powerful tool for policymakers to design measures able to increase selection of medical curricula."
https://openalex.org/W2562511300,"Purpose Cystic fibrosis (CF) is commonly recognized as a pulmonary disease associated with reduced airway function. Another primary symptom of CF is low exercise capacity where ventilation and gas-exchange are exacerbated. However, an independent link between pathophysiology of the pulmonary system and abnormal ventilatory and gas-exchange responses during cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) has not been established in CF. Complicating this understanding, accumulating evidence suggests CF demonstrate abnormal peripheral vascular function; although, the clinical implications are unclear. We hypothesized that compared to controls, relative to total work performed (WorkTOT), CF would demonstrate increased ventilation accompanied by augmented systolic blood pressure (SBP) during CPET. Methods 16 CF and 23 controls (age: 23±4 vs. 27±4 years, P = 0.11; FEV1%predicted: 73±14 vs. 96±5, P<0.01) participated in CPET. Breath-by-breath oxygen uptake (), ventilation (), and carbon dioxide output () were measured continuously during incremental 3-min stage step-wise cycle ergometry CPET. SBP was measured via manual sphygmomanometry. Linear regression was used to calculate slope from rest to peak-exercise. Results Compared to controls, CF performed less WorkTOT during CPET (90±19 vs. 43±14 kJ, respectively, P<0.01). With WorkTOT as a covariate, peak (62±8 vs. 90±4 L/min, P = 0.76), (1.8±0.3 vs. 2.7±0.1 L/min, P = 0.40), and SBP (144±13 vs. 152±6 mmHg, P = 0.88) were similar between CF and controls, respectively; whereas CF demonstrated increased slope (38±4 vs. 28±2, P = 0.02) but lower peak versus controls (22±5 vs. 33±4 mL/kg/min, P<0.01). There were modest-to-moderate correlations between peak SBP with (r = 0.30), (r = 0.70), and (r = 0.62) in CF. Conclusions These data suggest that relative to WorkTOT, young adults with mild-to-moderate severity CF demonstrate augmented slope accompanied by increased SBP during CPET. Although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear, the coupling of ventilatory inefficiency with increased blood pressure suggest important contributions from peripheral pathophysiology to low exercise capacity in CF."
https://openalex.org/W2567560296,"Background Regulation of hepatic glucose production has been a target for antidiabetic drug development, due to its major contribution to glucose homeostasis. Previous pre-clinical study demonstrated that peripheral electrical stimulation (PES) may stimulate glucose utilization and improve hepatic insulin sensitivity. The aim of the present study was to evaluate safety, tolerability, and the glucose-lowering effect of this approach in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Methods Twelve patients with T2DM were recruited for an open label, interventional, randomized trial. Eleven patients underwent, in a crossover design, an active, and a no-intervention control periods, separated with a two-week washout phase. During the active period, the patients received a daily lower extremity PES treatment (1.33Hz/16Hz burst mode), for 14 days. Study endpoints included changes in glucose levels, number of hypoglycemic episodes, and other potential side effects. Endpoints were analyzed based on continuous glucose meter readings, and laboratory evaluation. Results We found that during the active period, the most significant effect was on nocturnal glucose control (P < 0.0004), as well as on pre-meal mean glucose levels (P < 0.02). The mean daily glucose levels were also decreased although it did not reach clinical significance (P = 0.07). A reduction in serum cortisol (P < 0.01) but not in insulin was also detected after 2 weeks of treatment. No adverse events were recorded. Conclusions These results indicate that repeated PES treatment, even for a very short duration, can improve blood glucose control, possibly by suppressing hepatic glucose production. This effect may be mediated via hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis modulation. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02727790"
https://openalex.org/W2562975731,"Steroid-induced sleep disturbance is a common and highly distressing morbidity for children receiving steroid chemotherapy for the treatment of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Sleep disturbance can negatively impact overall quality of life, neurodevelopment, memory consolidation, and wound healing. Hypothalamic orexin neurons are influential wake-promoting neurons, and disturbances in orexin signaling leads to abnormal sleep behavior. A new class of drug, the orexin receptor antagonists, could be an intriguing option for sleep disorders caused by increased orexinergic output. Our aim was to examine the impact of ALL treatment doses of corticosteroids on the orexin system in rodents and in children undergoing treatment for childhood ALL.We administered repeated injections of dexamethasone to rodents and measured responsive orexin neural activity compared to controls. In children with newly diagnosed standard risk B-cell ALL receiving dexamethasone therapy per Children's Oncology Group (COG) induction therapy from 2014-2016, we collected pre- and during-steroids matched CSF samples and measured the impact of steroids on CSF orexin concentration.In both rodents, all markers orexin signaling, including orexin neural output and orexin receptor expression, were preserved in the setting of dexamethasone. Additionally, we did not detect a difference in pre- and during-dexamethasone CSF orexin concentrations in children receiving dexamethasone.Our results demonstrate that rodent and human orexin physiology is largely preserved in the setting of high dose dexamethasone. The data obtained in our experimental model fail to demonstrate a causative role for disruption of the orexin pathway in steroid-induced sleep disturbance."

https://openalex.org/W2564946878,"Whole-genome shotgun (WGS) sequencing has become a routine method in genome research over the past decade. However, the assembly of highly polymorphic regions in WGS projects remains a challenge, especially for large genomes. Employing BAC library constructing, PCR screening and Sanger sequencing, traditional strategy is laborious and expensive, which hampers research on polymorphic genomic regions. As one of the most highly polymorphic regions, the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) plays a central role in the adaptive immunity of all jawed vertebrates. In this study, we introduced an efficient procedure based on recombination screening and short-reads assembly. With this procedure, we constructed a high quality 488-kb region of crested ibis MHC that consists of 3 superscaffolds and contains 50 genes. Our sequence showed comparable quality (97.29% identity) to traditional Sanger assembly, while the workload was reduced almost 7 times. Comparative study revealed distinctive features of crested ibis by exhibiting the COL11A2-BLA-BLB-BRD2 cluster and presenting both ADPRH and odorant receptor (OR) gene in the MHC region. Furthermore, the conservation of the BF-TAP1-TAP2 structure in crested ibis and other vertebrate lineages is interesting in light of the hypothesis that coevolution of functionally related genes in the primordial MHC is responsible for the appearance of the antigen presentation pathways at the birth of the adaptive immune system."
