https://openalex.org/W2077567164,A technique for determining fetal sex by counting the number of sex chromatin bodies in the nuclei of amniotic fluid cells is described. The mean incidence of sex chromatin body in nuclei in the fluid of female fetuses was 4-6 times that found in male fetuses. The minimum incidence of sex chromatin in females was approximately twice the maximum incidence in male fetuses. The interpretive technique is discussed.

Though I have held this view for some time, and have discussed it with others, I have not advanced it formally, because until now it did not appear to be useful. There are, it is true, subcellular actions which have been described for hormones ; notably one may mention the interesting effects of thyroxine upon the oxidative phosphorylation of mitochondria which formed the basis of a recent lecture to the Third International Congress of Biochemistry by C. Martius. There are also conclusive observations upon the action of insulin in altering permeability to sugars1,2; and also, on the contrary, the widespread idea that insulin controls the formation of glucose 6-phosphate. Yet in spite of interest in these facts, there is a general feeling that hormones act upon the cell as a whole, and that their action is somewhat diverse rather than being upon one enzymic or other step (cf. A. Beloff-Chain et al.
3, and see particularly the discussion of this by O. Hechter4). It is from this aspect that I think the ‘cytoskeletal’ view may prove to be a useful working hypothesis."

https://openalex.org/W1974531885,RADIOACTIVE streptomycin has been prepared by various investigators by biosynthetic incorporation of carbon-14 in the streptomycin molecule. Their aim has been to study actinomycete metabolism. The purpose of the present investigation was to prepare radioactive streptomycin for autoradiographical studies of its distribution in the body.
