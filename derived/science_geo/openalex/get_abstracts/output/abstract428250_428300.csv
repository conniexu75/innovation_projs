https://openalex.org/W2044502296,"Mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) is a key activator of protein kinases that act downstream of insulin and growth factor signaling. Here we report that mice lacking the essential mTORC2 component rictor in liver (Lrictor(KO)) are unable to respond normally to insulin. In response to insulin, Lrictor(KO) mice failed to inhibit hepatic glucose output. Lrictor(KO) mice also fail to develop hepatic steatosis on a high fat diet and manifest half-normal serum cholesterol levels. This is accompanied by lower levels of expression of SREBP-1c and SREBP-2 and genes of fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis. Lrictor(KO) mice had defects in insulin-stimulated Akt Ser-473 and Thr-308 phosphorylation, leading to decreased phosphorylation of Akt substrates FoxO, GSK-3β, PRAS40, AS160, and Tsc2. Lrictor(KO) mice also manifest defects in insulin-activated mTORC1 activity, evidenced by decreased S6 kinase and Lipin1 phosphorylation. Glucose intolerance and insulin resistance of Lrictor(KO) mice could be fully rescued by hepatic expression of activated Akt2 or dominant negative FoxO1. However, in the absence of mTORC2, forced Akt2 activation was unable to drive hepatic lipogenesis. Thus, we have identified an Akt-independent relay from mTORC2 to hepatic lipogenesis that separates the effects of insulin on glucose and lipid metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1990628815,"Most human pre-mRNA transcripts are alternatively spliced, but the significance and fine-tuning of alternative splicing in different biological processes is only starting to be understood. SRSF3 (SRp20) is a member of a highly conserved family of splicing factors that have critical roles in key biological processes, including tumor progression. Here, we show that SRSF3 regulates cellular senescence, a p53-mediated process to suppress tumorigenesis, through TP53 alternative splicing. Downregulation of SRSF3 was observed in normal human fibroblasts undergoing replicative senescence, and was associated with the upregulation of p53β, an alternatively spliced isoform of p53 that promotes p53-mediated senescence. Knockdown of SRSF3 by short interfering RNA (siRNA) in early-passage fibroblasts induced senescence, which was associated with elevated expression of p53β at mRNA and protein levels. Knockdown of p53 partially rescued SRSF3-knockdown-induced senescence, suggesting that SRSF3 acts on p53-mediated cellular senescence. RNA pulldown assays demonstrated that SRSF3 binds to an alternatively spliced exon uniquely included in p53β mRNA through the consensus SRSF3-binding sequences. RNA crosslinking and immunoprecipitation assays (CLIP) also showed that SRSF3 in vivo binds to endogenous p53 pre-mRNA at the region containing the p53β-unique exon. Splicing assays using a transfected TP53 minigene in combination with siRNA knockdown of SRSF3 showed that SRSF3 functions to inhibit the inclusion of the p53β-unique exon in splicing of p53 pre-mRNA. These data suggest that downregulation of SRSF3 represents an endogenous mechanism for cellular senescence that directly regulates the TP53 alternative splicing to generate p53β. This study uncovers the role for general splicing machinery in tumorigenesis, and suggests that SRSF3 is a direct regulator of p53."
https://openalex.org/W1964314452,"Chronic nonhealing wounds, such as venous ulcers (VUs), are a widespread and serious medical problem with high morbidity and mortality. The molecular pathology of VUs remains poorly understood, impeding the development of effective treatment strategies. Using mRNA expression profiling of VUs biopsies and computational analysis, we identified a candidate set of microRNAs with lowered target gene expression. Among these candidates, miR-16, -20a, -21, -106a -130a, and -203 were confirmed to be aberrantly overexpressed in a cohort study of 10 VU patients by quantitative PCR and in situ hybridizations. These microRNAs were predicted to target multiple genes important for wound healing, including early growth response factor 3, vinculin, and leptin receptor (LepR). Overexpression of the top up-regulated miRNAs, miR-21 and miR-130a, in primary human keratinocytes down-regulated expression of the endogenous LepR and early growth response factor 3. The luciferase reporter assay verified LepR as a direct target for miR-21 and miR-130a. Both miR-21 and miR-130a delayed epithelialization in an acute human skin wound model. Furthermore, in vivo overexpression of miR-21 inhibited epithelialization and granulation tissue formation in a rat wound model. Our results identify a novel mechanism in which overexpression of specific set of microRNAs inhibits wound healing, resulting in new potential molecular markers and targets for therapeutic intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2025728074,"Pluripotent cells can be derived from various types of somatic cells by nuclear reprogramming using defined transcription factors. It is, however, unclear whether human cancer cells can be similarly reprogrammed and subsequently terminally differentiated with abrogation of tumorigenicity. Here, using sarcomas we show that human-derived complex karyotype solid tumors: (1) can be reprogrammed into a pluripotent-like state as defined by all in vitro criteria used to define pluripotent stem cells generated from somatic cells; (2) can be terminally differentiated into mature connective tissue and red blood cells; and (3) terminal differentiation is accompanied with loss of both proliferation and tumorigenicity. We go on to perform the first global DNA promoter methylation and gene expression analyses comparing human cancers to their reprogrammed counterparts and report that reprogramming/differentiation results in significant epigenetic remodeling of oncogenes and tumor suppressors, while not significantly altering the differentiation status of the reprogrammed cancer cells, in essence dedifferentiating them to a state slightly before the mesenchymal stem cell differentiation stage. Our data demonstrate that direct nuclear reprogramming can restore terminal differentiation potential to human-derived cancer cells, with simultaneous loss of tumorigenicity, without the need to revert to an embryonic state. We anticipate that our models would serve as a starting point to more fully assess how nuclear reprogramming overcomes the multitude of genetic and epigenetic aberrancies inherent in human cancers to restore normal terminal differentiation pathways. Finally, these findings suggest that nuclear reprogramming may be a broadly applicable therapeutic strategy for the treatment of cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2021369251,"The reversible acetylation of histones and non-histone proteins by histone acetyltransferases and deacetylases (HDACs) plays a critical role in many cellular processes in eukaryotic cells. HDAC6 is a unique histone deacetylase with two deacetylase domains and a C-terminal zinc finger domain. HDAC6 resides mainly in the cytoplasm and regulates many important biological processes, including cell migration and degradation of misfold proteins. HDAC6 has also been shown to localize in the nucleus to regulate transcription. However, how HDAC6 shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm is largely unknown. In addition, it is not clear how HDAC6 enzymatic activity is modulated. Here, we show that HDAC6 can be acetylated by p300 on five clusters of lysine residues. One cluster (site B) of acetylated lysine is in the N-terminal nuclear localization signal region. These lysine residues in site B were converted to glutamine to mimic acetylated lysines. The mutations significantly reduced HDAC6 tubulin deacetylase activity and further impaired cell motility, but had no effect on histone deacetylase activity. More interestingly, these mutations retained HDAC6 in the cytoplasm by blocking the interaction with the nuclear import protein importin-α. The retention of HDAC6 in the cytoplasm by acetylation eventually affects histone deacetylation. Thus, we conclude that acetylation is an important post-translational modification that regulates HDAC6 tubulin deacetylase activity and nuclear import.

Histone deacetylases (HDACs) 2The abbreviation used is: HDAChistone deacetylase. catalyze the removal of acetyl groups from the ϵ-amino groups of lysine residues from histone and a variety of non-histone proteins. Mammalian HDACs are classified into four classes (I–IV) based on the sequence homology of the yeast histone deacetylases Rpd3 (reduced potassium dependence 3), Hda1 (histone deacetylase 1), and Sir2 (silent information regulator 2). Class II HDACs are further divided into two subclasses (IIa and IIb) based on the similarity of protein sequence and function. Class IIa contains HDAC4, HDAC5, HDAC7, and HDAC9, whereas Class IIb contains HDAC6 and HDAC10 (reviewed in Ref. 1.Yang X.J. Seto E.

The Class IIb member HDAC6 possesses two deacetylase domains and a zinc finger motif (ZnF-UBP, zinc-finger ubiquitin binding domain) (2.Seigneurin-Berny D. Verdel A. Curtet S. Lemercier C. Garin J.

In addition to its deacetylase domains, HDAC6 possesses a ZnF-UBP finger that binds to ubiquitin and is involved in ubiquitin-dependent aggresome formation and cellular clearance of misfolded proteins (3.Yang X.J.

Both the deacetylase and ubiquitin-binding activities of HDAC6 are required for these processes. Therefore, HDAC6 regulates various processes in the cytoplasm. Several lines of evidence suggest that HDAC6 can also reside in the nucleus and interact with nuclear proteins, including HDAC11 (9.Gao L. Cueto M.A. Asselbergs F. Atadja P.

It has been suggested that nuclear import and export signals within HDAC6 regulate the cellular localization of HDAC6 (12.Verdel A. Curtet S. Brocard M.P. Rousseaux S. Lemercier C. Yoshida M.

However, how the shuttling of HDAC6 between the nucleus and cytoplasm is regulated remains largely unknown. In addition, it is not clear how HDAC6 activity is modulated. In eukaryotic cells, acetylation is among the most common covalent modifications. Deacetylation of non-histone protein plays a diverse role in the regulation of all aspects of cellular processes (14.Glozak M.A. Sengupta N. Zhang X. Seto E. Acetylation and deacetylation of non-histone proteins.Gene. 2005; 363: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar). Acetylation of non-histone protein affects a broad spectrum of protein function, including signaling, enzymatic activity, protein-protein or protein-DNA interaction, protein stability, and protein localization (reviewed in Ref. 15.Spange S. Wagner T. Heinzel T. Krämer O.H. Acetylation of non-histone proteins modulates cellular signaling at multiple levels.Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2009; 41: 185-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). Acetylation modification has been found in several deacetylases. It had been shown that HDAC1 can be acetylated at the catalytic domain and the C-terminal region, resulting in a dramatic reduction in enzymatic activity (16.Qiu Y. Zhao Y. Becker M. John S.

HDAC1 acetylation is linked to progressive modulation of steroid receptor-induced gene transcription.Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 669-679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Other deacetylases such as HDAC6 and Sirt2 can also be acetylated by p300; however, the function of the modulation is largely unknown (17.Han Y. Jin Y.H. Kim Y.J. Kang B.Y. Choi H.J. Kim D.W. Yeo C.Y. Lee K.Y. Acetylation of Sirt2 by p300 attenuates its deacetylase activity.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 375: 576-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 18.Han Y. Jeong H.M.

Commun. 2009; 383: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Here, we show that HDAC6 is acetylated by p300 on five clusters of lysine residues. One cluster (site B) of acetylated lysine is in the N-terminal nuclear localization signal region. Acetylation of site B lysine residues significantly reduced HDAC6 tubulin deacetylase activity and further impaired cell motility, but had no effect on histone deacetylase activity. More interestingly, these mutations retained HDAC6 in the cytoplasm by blocking the interaction with the nuclear import protein importin-α and eventually affected histone deacetylation. Thus, our results indicate that acetylation is an important post-translational modification that regulates HDAC6 tubulin deacetylase activity and nuclear import. The GFP-HDAC6 plasmid was obtained from Dr. Xiang-Jiao Yang (McGill University). The catalytically dead HDAC6(H216A/H611A) mutant has been described elsewhere (19.Kawaguchi Y. Kovacs J.J. McLaurin A.

It has been reported that HDAC6 can interact with p300 (10.Girdwood D. Bumpass D. Vaughan O.A. Thain A. Anderson L.A. Snowden A.W. Garcia-Wilson E. Perkins N.D. Hay R.T. p300 transcriptional repression is mediated by SUMO modification.Mol.

Acetylation of histone deacetylase 6 by p300 attenuates its deacetylase activity.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2009; 383: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, the function of acetylated HDAC6 has not been studied. We first wanted to identify the acetylated lysine residues of HDAC6. Recombinant human HDAC6 purified from baculovirus-infected insect cells was incubated with p300 in vitro, and the reaction resulted in strong acetylation of HDAC6 (Fig. 1A). The acetylated lysine residues of HDAC6 were determined by mass spectrometry. HDAC6 was acetylated at multiple lysine residues in five clusters (Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. S1). Sites A and B are in the nuclear localization domain. Site C is located in the second deacetylase domain, and sites D and E are located at the junction between the second deacetylase domain and the SE14 domain. These acetylation sites are conserved throughout mammalian species (supplemental Fig. S2), indicating the conserved function in HDAC6 acetylation. Each cluster of lysines was mutated to glutamines to mimic the acetylated form of lysine. The recombinant wild-type and mutant HDAC6 proteins were purified from baculovirus-infected insect cells and tested for acetylation modification. No single-cluster mutation affected HDAC6 acetylation. The mutations of sites A–D combined partially affected the acetylation level, and mutations of all five clusters abolished HDAC6 acetylation (Fig. 1C), confirming that all five sites are subject to acetylation. To test whether the mutations affect HDAC6 tubulin deacetylase activity, GFP HDAC6 and mutant constructs were transfected into 293T cells, and tubulin acetylation levels were determined. The results indicate that all single-site Lys-to-Gln mutations, except mutant B (mutB), did not affect tubulin deacetylase activity (Fig. 2A). Mutations of site B decreased the tubulin deacetylase activity of HDAC6. Mutant ABCDE (mutABCDE) and mutB were also transfected into A549-HDAC6 knockdown cells (19.Kawaguchi Y. Kovacs J.J. McLaurin A. Vance J.M. Ito A. Yao T.P. The deacetylase HDAC6 regulates aggresome formation and cell viability in response to misfolded protein stress.Cell. 2003; 115: 727-738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1198) Google Scholar). The overexpression of these mutants reduced tubulin deacetylase activity (Fig. 2B). To further confirm that the reduction in tubulin deacetylase activity directly resulted from the mutation of the protein, an in vitro assay was also performed with recombinant HDAC6 mutants and polymerized microtubules. The results show that, consistent with the in vivo results, mutB and mutABCDE had reduced tubulin deacetylase activity (Fig. 2C). Thus, the acetylation-mimicking mutations of HDAC6 affect tubulin deacetylase activity in vitro and in vivo. Because it has been shown that HDAC6 can positively regulate cell mobility through deacetylation of tubulin (22.Haggarty S.J. Koeller K.M. Wong J.C. Grozinger C.M. Schreiber S.L.

HDAC6 is a microtubule-associated deacetylase.Nature. 2002; 417: 455-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (1788) Google Scholar), we rationalized that the reduction in tubulin deacetylase activity through acetylation of HDAC6 will result in a change in cell mobility. To test this, GFP-HDAC6 and GFP-mutABCDE were stably transfected into A549-HDAC6 knockdown cells. Cell mobility was tested in these two cell lines. Cells expressing mutABCDE had lower mobility than cells overexpressing wild-type HDAC6 (Fig. 2C). This result indicates that acetylation of HDAC6 reduces tubulin deacetylase activity and subsequently affects cell mobility. Because HDAC6 can also deacetylate histone, we next tested whether acetylation of HDAC6 affects its histone deacetylase activity. Recombinant HDAC6 was acetylated in vitro; tritium-labeled acetylated histone was then added to test the deacetylase activity of HDAC6. Acetylation did not affect HDAC6 histone deacetylase activity (Fig. 3A). The mutations that mimicked acetylation also did not affect the histone deacetylase activity (Fig. 3B). The mutation of each site did not affect histone deacetylase activity as well (supplemental Fig. S3). These results indicate that HDAC6 acetylation affects tubulin deacetylase activity, but not histone deacetylase activity. Because HDAC6 acetylation sites A and B are located in the N-terminal nuclear localization domain (Fig. 4A), we next wanted to investigate whether acetylation affects HDAC6 cellular localization. HDAC6 possesses one nuclear localization signal and two nuclear export signals (Fig. 4A) (12.Verdel A. Curtet S. Brocard M.P. Rousseaux S. Lemercier C. Yoshida M. Khochbin S.

Chem. 2004; 279: 48246-48254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The nuclear export signals may play a dominant role because the majority of HDAC6 is localized in the cytoplasm. To investigate the function of acetylation of the nuclear localization domain, we created a construct that contained the N-terminal 66 amino acids, including a nuclear localization domain, but not nuclear export signals (13.Bertos N.R. Gilquin B. Chan G.K. Yen T.J. Khochbin S. Yang X.J. Role of the tetradecapeptide repeat domain of human histone deacetylase 6 in cytoplasmic retention.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48246-48254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). When transfected into 3T3 cells, GFP-HDAC6(1–66) was mostly in the nucleus (Fig. 4B). This agrees with a previous observation showing that this region is important for nuclear import (13.Bertos N.R. Gilquin B. Chan G.K. Yen T.J. Khochbin S. Yang X.J. Role of the tetradecapeptide repeat domain of human histone deacetylase 6 in cytoplasmic retention.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48246-48254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The site A acetylation-mimicking mutant was partially localized in the nucleus. Interestingly, the site B and site AB mutants were localized mostly in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4B). These results indicate that acetylation of site B abolishes the nuclear localization signal, resulting in cytoplasm retention of HDAC6. Although HDAC6 resides mainly in the cytoplasm (3.Yang X.J. Seto E. The Rpd3/Hda1 family of lysine deacetylases: from bacteria and yeast to mice and men.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 206-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar), it has been reported that HDAC6 is capable of shuttling between the nucleus and the cytoplasm (12.Verdel A. Curtet S. Brocard M.P. Rousseaux S. Lemercier C. Yoshida M. Khochbin S. Active maintenance of mHDA2/mHDAC6 histone deacetylase in the cytoplasm.Curr.

Class II histone deacetylases: versatile regulators.Trends Genet. 2003; 19: 286-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). It has been show that HDAC6 can partially reside in the nucleus and interact with nuclear proteins in a human T cell leukemia cell line (Jurkat cells) (25.Wang Z. Zang C. Cui K. Schones D.E. Barski A. Peng W. Zhao K. Genome-wide mapping of HATs and HDACs reveals distinct functions in active and inactive genes.Cell. 2009; 138: 1019-1031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). We then further investigated whether leukemia cells contain more nuclear HDAC6 than other cell types. The results show that, in addition to Jurkat cells, the human leukemia cell line K562 also has a higher level of nuclear HDAC6 compared with non-hematopoietic cell lines such as HCT116 and 293T (Fig. 4C). To study whether HDAC6 acetylation affects nuclear localization of HDAC6, GFP wild-type HDAC6, mutB, and mutABCDE were transfected into K562 cells, and their cellular localization was examined. The expression levels of GFP HDAC6 and mutants were comparable in the cell extract; however, wild-type HDAC6, but not mutB or mutABCDE, was detected in the nuclear extract (Fig. 4D). These results indicate that acetylation of HDAC6 affects its nuclear localization signal and results in cytoplasmic retention of HDAC6. Next, we investigated whether the loss of the nuclear localization signal by acetylation is due to the loss of interaction with the nuclear import protein. FLAG-tagged recombinant HDAC6 and mutB or mutABCDE were immobilized on M2-agarose beads and incubated with whole cell extracts from K562 cells. HDAC6 pulled down a significant amount of importin-α. However, the interaction between importin-α and mutB or mutABCDE was significantly reduced (Fig. 5). These results suggest that importin-α is important for HDAC6 nuclear import and that acetylation of HDAC6 reduces the interaction with importin-α. Thus, acetylated HDAC6 is unable to be imported into the nucleus, resulting in a reduction in nuclear HDAC6 levels. Although acetylation of HDAC6 did not affect its histone deacetylase activity (Fig. 3), the reduction in the nuclear fraction of HDAC6 protein by acetylation may eventually affect the overall histone deacetylase activity in the nucleus. To test this, GFP-HDAC6 and GFP-HDAC6 mutants mimicking acetylated or catalytically inactive HDAC6 were overexpressed at a high level into K562 cells, and the nuclear localization of HDAC6 proteins and histone deacetylase activity were examined. Consistent with the results in Fig. 4, a portion of GFP wild-type HDAC6, but not mutB or mutABCDE, localized in the nucleus. The HDAC6(H216A/H611A) mutant, which is a catalytically defective mutant, was also detected in the nucleus (Fig. 6). However, the histone acetylation level in the nucleus was reduced only in cells overexpressing GFP-tagged wild-type HDAC6 (Fig. 6). These results indicate that nuclear HDAC6 can play an important role in deacetylation of histone. In addition, acetylation of HDAC6, which inhibits HDAC6 nuclear localization, prevents histone deacetylation by HDAC6. Here, we have shown that HDAC6 can be acetylated by p300 on five clusters of lysine residues. Sites A and B are localized within the N-terminal nuclear localization domain, and mutations that mimic acetylation abolish nuclear import of HDAC6. Site C is located in the second deacetylase domain and is conserved only within the second deacetylase domain of mammalian HDAC6, suggesting a unique role for this deacetylase domain. However, we do not anticipate that acetylation of this site will affect deacetylase activity. The function of acetylation of this site is still under investigation. Sites D and E are located at the junction between the second deacetylase domain and the SE14 domain and are less conserved. Mutation of these two sites also does not affect enzymatic activity. However, because HDAC6 has diverse cytoplasmic and nuclear functions, whether mutation of these sites affects HDAC6 function other than deacetylase activity is under investigation. Acetylation of HDAC6 affects tubulin deacetylase activity, but not histone deacetylase activity. Although it is debatable whether both deacetylase domains contribute equally to the deacetylase activities of tubulin and histone (5.Zhang Y. Li N. Caron C. Matthias G. Hess D. Khochbin S.

Commun. 2006; 341: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), our data suggest that histone and tubulin deacetylase activities may be regulated differently, as acetylation of HDAC6 affects only tubulin deacetylase activity, but not histone deacetylase activity. Acetylation of site B seems to play a major role in down-regulation of tubulin deacetylase activity (Fig. 2, A and B). Interestingly, site B is localized outside of the catalytic domain. Similarly, HDAC1 acetylation sites also localize outside of catalytic domain, and acetylation of HDAC1 attenuates its deacetylase activity (16.Qiu Y. Zhao Y. Becker M. John S. Parekh B.S. Huang S. Hendarwanto A. Martinez E.D. Chen Y. Lu H. Adkins N.L. Stavreva D.A. Wiench M. Georgel P.T. Schiltz R.L. Hager G.L. HDAC1 acetylation is linked to progressive modulation of steroid receptor-induced gene transcription.Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 669-679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Thus, it may be common for HDACs that their activities can be regulated through a regulatory domain that is outside of the core deacetylase domain. HDAC6 has a strong nuclear export signal, which results in cytoplasmic retention of HDAC6. In addition, another region of human HDAC6, the SE14 domain, also contributes to the strong anchorage of HDAC6 in the cytoplasm (13.Bertos N.R. Gilquin B. Chan G.K. Yen T.J. Khochbin S. Yang X.J.

Curtet S. Brocard M.P. Rousseaux S. Lemercier C. Yoshida M. Khochbin S. Active maintenance of mHDA2/mHDAC6 histone deacetylase in the cytoplasm.Curr.

Some cells, especially hematopoietic cells, have significant amounts of nuclear HDAC6. It has been shown that HDAC6 can be recruited to gene promoters and gene bodies, suggesting a role for histone deacetylation and transcription regulation (25.Wang Z. Zang C. Cui K. Schones D.E.

The localization of HDAC6 in the nucleus is mainly because HDAC6 has a nuclear localization signal located in the N-terminal region. This region can interact with importin-α and be shuttled into the nucleus. Interestingly, this region is heavily acetylated, and acetylation blocks the interaction with importin-α and results in a reduction in nuclear HDAC6. In turn, the reduction in nuclear HDAC6 affects histone deacetylation and subsequently affects gene function. Therefore, acetylation is an important post-translational modification that regulates both the cytoplasm and nuclear function of HDAC6. We thank Drs.

https://openalex.org/W2092522192,"Tumor progression is a complex, multistep process involving accumulation of genetic aberrations and alterations in gene expression patterns leading to uncontrolled cell division, invasion into surrounding tissue and finally dissemination and metastasis. We have previously shown that the Arg/Abl2 non-receptor tyrosine kinase acts downstream of the EGF receptor and Src tyrosine kinases to promote invadopodium function in breast cancer cells, thereby promoting their invasiveness. However, whether and how Arg contributes to tumor development and dissemination in vivo has never been investigated. Using a mouse xenograft model, we show that knocking down Arg in breast cancer cells leads to increased tumor cell proliferation and significantly enlarged tumor size. Despite having larger tumors, the Arg-knockdown (Arg KD) tumor-bearing mice exhibit significant reductions in tumor cell invasion, intravasation into blood vessels and spontaneous metastasis to lungs. Interestingly, we found that proliferation-associated genes in the Ras-MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) pathway are upregulated in Arg KD breast cancer cells, as is Ras-MAPK signaling, while invasion-associated genes are significantly downregulated. These data suggest that Arg promotes tumor cell invasion and dissemination, while simultaneously inhibiting tumor growth. We propose that Arg acts as a switch in metastatic cancer cells that governs the decision to 'grow or go' (divide or invade)."
https://openalex.org/W2082865308,"In autophagy, a cup-shaped membrane called the isolation membrane is formed, expanded, and sealed to complete a double membrane-bound vesicle called the autophagosome that encapsulates cellular constituents to be transported to and degraded in the lysosome/vacuole. The formation of the autophagosome requires autophagy-related (Atg) proteins. Atg8 is a ubiquitin-like protein that localizes to the isolation membrane; a subpopulation of this protein remains inside the autophagosome and is transported to the lysosome/vacuole. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Atg1 is a serine/threonine kinase that functions in the initial step of autophagosome formation and is also efficiently transported to the vacuole via autophagy. Here, we explore the mechanism and significance of this autophagic transport of Atg1. In selective types of autophagy, receptor proteins recognize degradation targets and also interact with Atg8, via the Atg8 family interacting motif (AIM), to link the targets to the isolation membrane. We find that Atg1 contains an AIM and directly interacts with Atg8. Mutations in the AIM disrupt this interaction and abolish vacuolar transport of Atg1. These results suggest that Atg1 associates with the isolation membrane by binding to Atg8, resulting in its incorporation into the autophagosome. We also show that mutations in the Atg1 AIM cause a significant defect in autophagy, without affecting the functions of Atg1 implicated in triggering autophagosome formation. We propose that in addition to its essential function in the initial stage, Atg1 also associates with the isolation membrane to promote its maturation into the autophagosome."
https://openalex.org/W1972095462,"Understanding mechanisms underlying titin regulation in cardiac muscle function is of critical importance given recent compelling evidence that highlight titin mutations as major determinants of human cardiomyopathy. We previously identified a cardiac biomechanical stress-regulated complex at the cardiac-specific N2B region of titin that includes four-and-a-half LIM domain protein-1 (Fhl1) and components of the mitogen-activated protein signaling cascade, which impacted muscle compliance in Fhl1 knock-out cardiac muscle. However, direct regulation of these molecular components in mediating titin N2B function remained unresolved. Here we identify Fhl1 as a novel negative regulator of titin N2B levels and phosphorylation-mediated mechanics. We specifically identify titin N2B as a novel substrate of extracellular signal regulated-kinase-2 (Erk2) and demonstrate that Fhl1 directly interferes with Erk2-mediated titin-N2B phosphorylation. We highlight the critical region in titin-N2B that interacts with Fhl1 and residues that are dependent on Erk2-mediated phosphorylation in situ. We also propose a potential mechanism for a known titin-N2B cardiomyopathy-causing mutation that involves this regulatory complex. These studies shed light on a novel mechanism regulating titin-N2B mechano-signaling as well as suggest that dysfunction of these pathways could be important in cardiac disease states affecting muscle compliance."
https://openalex.org/W2018758095,"Wnts are essential for a wide range of developmental processes, including cell growth, division, and differentiation. Some of these processes signal via the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway, which is a β-catenin-independent Wnt signaling pathway. Previous studies have shown that Ryk, a member of the receptor tyrosine kinase family, can bind to Wnts. Ryk is required for normal axon guidance and neuronal differentiation during development. Here, we demonstrate that mammalian Ryk interacts with the Wnt/PCP pathway. In vitro analysis showed that the Wnt inhibitory factor domain of Ryk was necessary for Wnt binding. Detailed analysis of two vertebrate model organisms showed Ryk phenotypes consistent with PCP signaling. In zebrafish, gene knockdown using morpholinos revealed a genetic interaction between Ryk and Wnt11 during the PCP pathway-regulated process of embryo convergent extension. Ryk-deficient mouse embryos displayed disrupted polarity of stereociliary hair cells in the cochlea, a characteristic of disturbed PCP signaling. This PCP defect was also observed in mouse embryos that were double heterozygotes for Ryk and Looptail (containing a mutation in the core Wnt/PCP pathway gene Vangl2) but not in either of the single heterozygotes, suggesting a genetic interaction between Ryk and Vangl2. Co-immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that RYK and VANGL2 proteins form a complex, whereas RYK also activated RhoA, a downstream effector of PCP signaling. Overall, our data suggest an important role for Ryk in Wnt/planar cell polarity signaling during vertebrate development via the Vangl2 signaling pathway, as demonstrated in the mouse cochlea."
https://openalex.org/W2051260415,"The platelet collagen receptor glycoprotein VI (GPVI) has been suggested to function as a dimer, with increased affinity for collagen. Dissociation constants (K(d)) obtained by measuring recombinant GPVI binding to collagenous substrates showed that GPVI dimers bind with high affinity to tandem GPO (Gly-Pro-Hyp) sequences in collagen, whereas the markedly lower affinity of the monomer for all substrates implies that it is not the collagen-binding form of GPVI. Dimer binding required a high density of immobilized triple-helical (GPO)(10)-containing peptide, suggesting that the dimer binds multiple, discrete peptide helices. Differential inhibition of dimer binding by dimer-specific antibodies, m-Fab-F and 204-11 Fab, suggests that m-Fab-F binds at the collagen-binding site of the dimer, and 204-11 Fab binds to a discrete site. Flow cytometric quantitation indicated that GPVI dimers account for ~29% of total GPVI in resting platelets, whereas activation by either collagen-related peptide or thrombin increases the number of dimers to ~39 and ~44%, respectively. m-Fab-F inhibits both GPVI-dependent static platelet adhesion to collagen and thrombus formation on collagen under low and high shear, indicating that pre-existing dimeric GPVI is required for the initial interaction with collagen because affinity of the monomer is too low to support binding and that interaction through the dimer is essential for platelet activation. These GPVI dimers in resting circulating platelets will enable them to bind injury-exposed subendothelial collagen to initiate platelet activation. The GPVI-specific agonist collagen-related peptide or thrombin further increases the number of dimers, thereby providing a feedback mechanism for reinforcing binding to collagen and platelet activation."
https://openalex.org/W2080199752,"There is an increasing interest in determining the role of ribosomal proteins (RPs) in the regulation of MDM2-p53 pathway in coordinating cellular response to stress. Herein, we report a novel regulatory role of ribosomal protein S25 (RPS25) in MDM2-mediated p53 degradation and a feedback regulation of S25 by p53. We demonstrated that S25 interacted with MDM2 and inhibited its E3 ligase activity, resulting in the reduction of MDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitination and the stabilization and activation of p53. S25, MDM2 and p53 formed a ternary complex following ribosomal stress. The nucleolar localization and MDM2-binding domains of S25 were critical for its role in MDM2-mediated p53 regulation. Knockdown of S25 by siRNA attenuated the induction and activation of p53 following ribosomal stress. S25 stabilized and cooperated with MDMX to regulate MDM2 E3 ligase activity. Furthermore, S25 was identified to be a transcriptional target of p53; p53 directly bound to S25 promoter and suppressed S25 expression. Our results suggest that there is a S25-MDM2-p53 regulatory feedback loop, which may have an important role in cancer development and progression."

We previously described the interaction between NADPH oxidases and the endoplasmic reticulum redox chaperone protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) in many cell types. However, physiological implications, as well as mechanisms of such association, are yet unclear.

Furthermore, PDI silencing inhibited PDGF-induced VSMC migration assessed by distinct methods, whereas PDI overexpression increased spontaneous basal VSMC migration.

Perspectives series. Cell adhesion in vascular biology: smooth muscle migration in atherosclerosis and restenosis.J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2814-2816Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Redox processes are important mediators of growth factor-induced VSMC migration. Several studies showed that general inhibitors of reactive oxygen species (ROS) promote decrease in platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-induced migration (2Sundaresan M. Yu Z.X. Ferrans V.J.

Nox family NADPH oxidases, a major dedicated source of signaling ROS in most cells, closely synergize with growth factor-mediated signals to support VSMC migration. Silencing of Nox1 isoform inhibits ROS generation, migration, and metalloproteinase secretion in FGF-stimulated VSMCs (4Schröder K. Helmcke I. Palfi K. Krause K.H. Busse R. Brandes R.P.

Also, VSMCs from Nox1 y/− mice show impaired migration in response to thrombin (5Zimmerman M.C. Takapoo M. Jagadeesha D.K. Stanic B. Banfi B. Bhalla R.C. Miller Jr., F.J.

However, pathways that adjust Nox activation to specific physiologic programs in cells are unclear.

Overall, the versatile functions of PDI in central housekeeping processes such as protein folding and in other cellular signaling programs indicate that PDI(s) is(are) strategic to integrate cell homeostasis and signaling via pathways that include Nox-related redox processes. However, despite substantial evidence for links between PDI and NADPH oxidase activity, there is less evidence for physiological implications of this interaction. Moreover, mechanisms whereby PDI converges with Nox complex(es) are unclear. In the present study, we addressed the effect of PDI in PDGF-induced VSMC migration, which is associated with NADPH oxidase activation and ROS-dependent signaling. Moreover, using system biology tools to examine protein-protein interaction, as well as experimental approaches, we identified and provided evidence for a role of RhoGTPases and their regulator RhoGDI as possible mechanistical targets underlying the interplay between PDI and Nox-dependent VSMC migration. vascular smooth muscle cell angiotensin II dihydroethidium diethylentriamene pentaacetate 2-hydroxyethidium endoplasmic reticulum protein disulfide isomerase physical protein-protein interaction reactive oxygen species. Rabbit aortic VSMCs from a previously established selection-immortalized line were maintained in growth medium (F12, with 10% fetal bovine serum) at 37 °C, in 5% CO2 atmosphere. For transfection, VSMCs were plated at 40% (small interfering RNA) or 60% (plasmid) confluence on 6-well plates. After 8–12 h, cells were serum-starved for 12–16 h before transfection. Lipofectamine 2000 (3 μl; Invitrogen) alone or with Stealth® siRNA (50 nm; Invitrogen) or its scrambled nontargeting control siRNA (ScrRNA) transfection was performed in growth medium without serum and antibiotics for 6 h. Three different siRNA sequences against PDI were used: (#1 primer, 5′-G A G G U G G C C U U U G A C G A G A A G A A G A-3′; #2 primer, 5′-C A A G C A C C U G C U G G U G G A G U U C U A U-3′; #3 primer, 5′-G A C G A C A U U G U G A A C U G G C U G A A G A-3′;). The siRNA sequence against Nox1 was 5′-A C G A U A G C C U U G A U U C U C A U G G U A A-3′. Transient transfection with cDNA plasmids was performed with Lipofectamine 2000 (5 μl) and 5 μg of human PDI cDNA (kindly provided by Drs. Mariano Janiszewski and Lucia Lopes, from the University of São Paulo Biomedical Institute) or pCDNA3 (empty vector control) for 8 h. After siRNA or cDNA transfection, medium was replaced by growth medium for 72 h (siRNA) or 48 h (cDNA). Cultures were serum-starved for 12–24 h prior to treatment with human recombinant platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF; Sigma). ROS production in whole VSMCs was assessed by HPLC analysis of dihydroethidium (DHE)-derived oxidation products, as described (23Laurindo F.R. de Souza H.P. Pedro Mde A. Janiszewski M.

Results are expressed for 2-hydroxyethidium (EOH), which is specific for superoxide, and ethidium, which reflects less specific oxidants. Briefly, at base line or after previous stimulus, VSMCs were incubated for 30 min with 80 μm DHE on Krebs/0.1 mm DTPA. Cells were harvested in acetonitrile and centrifuged (12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C). The homogenate was dried under vacuum and analyzed by HPLC with fluorescence detectors (Waters). Quantification of DHE, EOH, and ethidium concentrations was performed as described (23Laurindo F.R. de Souza H.P. Pedro Mde A. Janiszewski M.

Results were expressed as calculated EOH or ethidium concentrations (micromolar), normalized for consumed DHE (i.e. initial minus remaining DHE concentration in the sample). VSMCs were incubated or not with PDGF (100 ng/ml for 2 h), and membrane homogenates were obtained by sequential centrifugation (23Laurindo F.R. de Souza H.P. Pedro Mde A. Janiszewski M.

Briefly, VSMCs were disrupted by sonication in buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm edta, 0.1 mm EGTA, and protease inhibitors (10 mg/ml aprotinin, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm PMSF) and centrifuged (18,000 × g, 15 min). After supernatant centrifugation (100,000 × g, 1 h), the membrane pellet was resuspended in the same buffer. Membrane fraction (40 μg of protein) was incubated with 80 μm DHE in Tris buffer (50 mm, pH 7.4) with DTPA 0.1 mm in the presence of NADPH (300 μm) for 30 min at 37 °C in the dark. After precipitation with trichloroacetic acid, the membrane fraction underwent another centrifugation (12,000 × g, 10 min). The final supernatant was analyzed by HPLC/fluorescence detection (excitation 480 nm/emission 580 nm) (23Laurindo F.R. de Souza H.P. Pedro Mde A. Janiszewski M. Redox aspects of vascular response to injury.Methods Enzymol. 2002; 352: 432-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), whereas DHE was monitored by ultraviolet absorption at 245 nm. Specificity for superoxide detection by this assay in Fig. 1D was tested with CuZnSOD incubation (25 μg/ml). The Transwell assay (Boyden Chamber) was modified from a previous report (3Weber D.S. Taniyama Y. Rocic P. Seshiah P.N. Dechert M.A. Gerthoffer W.T. Griendling K.K.

Briefly, 5×104 cells/well, previously starved (∼16 h), were added to the upper well, over a polycarbonate membrane (8 μm; Whatman). In some experiments, diphenyleneiodonium was added to the culture medium with the cells. PDGF (at described concentrations) was used as chemotactic stimulus at the lower well. After 4 h at 37 °C, nonmigrating cells were removed with a cotton swab, and the migrating cells at the membrane bottom side were stained with DAPI (1:100). Four fields/well were used to count the number of migrating cells on inverted microscope (Axiovert 200; Zeiss). Every condition was tested at least on duplicate wells. The wound-healing model was performed as described previously (25Taboubi S. Milanini J. Delamarre E. Parat F. Garrouste F. Pommier G. Takasaki J. Hubaud J.C. Kovacic H. Lehmann M. G alpha(q/11)-coupled P2Y2 nucleotide receptor inhibits human keratinocyte spreading and migration.FASEB J. 2007; 21: 4047-4058Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, monolayer VSMCs cultured in 12-well plates were starved for 24 h. The pictures were taken from the monolayer scratch before and 16 h after PDGF stimulus. Cell migration was evaluated at these two time points with ImageJ software. Data were expressed as the percentage of recovered surface on PDGF-induced cells minus base line condition. Every condition was performed at least in duplicate, and at least 10 pictures were taken on inverted microscope (Axiovert 200). Nox1 and Nox4 mRNA quantification were performed as described (26Wosniak Jr., J. Santos C.X. Kowaltowski A.J. Laurindo F.R. Cross-talk between mitochondria and NADPH oxidase: effects of mild mitochondrial dysfunction on angiotensin II-mediated increase in Nox isoform expression and activity in vascular smooth muscle cells.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2009; 11: 1265-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Isolated RNA (RNA Spin Mini kit; GE Healthcare) was reverse-transcribed with Superscript II (Invitrogen). Message expression was quantified with the use of SYBR Green PCR Mix and the Rotorgene 6000 cycler (Corbett) with Master Mix (Invitrogen) and Nox1 or Nox4 primers normalized to GADPH housekeeping. Forward primers, designed according to rabbit sequences, were: Nox1, C A T C A T G G A A G G A A G G A G A; Nox4, C C A C A G A C T T G G C T T T G G A T; GAPDH, T C A C C A T C T T C C A G G A G C G A. The incubation conditions were: 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 94 °C, annealing for 15 s, at 60 °C, and extension for 20 s at 72 °C. Assessment of Rac1 or RhoA activities was performed as described (27Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. Regulation of the small GTP-binding protein Rho by cell adhesion and the cytoskeleton.EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1361) Google Scholar). VSMCs were harvested on lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors) and centrifuged at 13,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C. Homogenates (500 μg) were incubated for 90 min at 4 °C with 20 μg of glutathione S-transferase-Pak1 binding domain (GST-PBD, to detect active Rac1) or with glutathione S-transferase-Rhotekin binding domain (GST-RBD, to detect active RhoA), previously coupled to glutathione-Sepharose. After washing four times (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2), proteins retained on the resins were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Rac1 or anti-RhoA antibody. Equal amounts of protein from lysates were resolved SDS-PAGE. Primary antibodies were mouse anti-PDIA1 (Enzo Life Science, catalog no. SPA891, 1:1000), mouse anti-Rac1 (Abcam, catalog no. ab33186, 1;1000), mouse anti-RhoA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalog no.

After incubation with appropriate peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, proteins were visualized by an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). VSMCs were seeded onto glass coverslips for 24 h before PDGF stimulus. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (1 h), permeabilized in 0.1% Nonidet p40 (30 min), and blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin (30 min). Primary antibodies, incubated overnight at 4 °C, were: mouse anti-PDIA1 (Enzo Life Science, 1:200), rabbit anti-PDIA1 (Enzo Life Science, catalog no. SPA890, 1:150), mouse anti-Rac1 (Abcam, 1:50), rabbit anti-RhoGDI (Abcam, 1:50), and rabbit anti-paxillin (Abcam, catalog no. ab32084). Fluorescent secondary antibodies, incubated for 1 h, 25 °C, were Alexa Fluor 488 (rabbit, 1:300) or 546 (mouse, 1:200). F-actin was stained with Alexa Fluor 635 phalloidin (catalog no. A34054, 1:100; Invitrogen). Nuclei were stained with DAPI (Invitrogen, 1:200). Cells were observed under oil immersion 63× objective on an inverted laser confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM510-Meta) at the Confocal “Rede Premium” Multiuser Facility from our institution. Pinhole was adjusted according to objective and sample thickness. Co-localization images represent one slice of 0.5 μm and not the sum of slices. Every condition was assessed from experiments performed in duplicate, and at least 10 images were collected for each coverslip. Results reflect images from at least three independent experiments. VSMCs were lysed with 50 mm Tris lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100. Immunoprecipitation was performed with 1 mg of lysate using specific antibodies against PDI (10 μg of mouse anti-PDIA1; Enzo Life Science), or anti-Rac1 (5 μg; Abcam), overnight at 4 °C. Protein G-Sepharose bead was added for 2 h, 4 °C. After washing five times, proteins retained on the resins were analyzed by immunoblotting with specific antibodies. The interactomic data gathered from human PDI proteins were used to obtain information about their potential interactions with other proteins in the context of physical protein-protein interactions (PPPI networks) in Homo sapiens. In this sense, the data mining screening and network design of a major PPPI network were performed using Cytoscape software, version 2.6.3 (28Shannon P. Markiel A. Ozier O. Baliga N.S. Wang J.T.

For this purpose, we used the PPPI data of H. sapiens available in the STRING 9 data base. The PDI-associated PPPI networks obtained from this first screening were then combined in a unique PPPI network by employing the union function of the Cytoscape core plugin Merge Networks. The major PPPI network was then analyzed with Molecular Complex Detection (MCODE) software (29Bader G.D. Hogue C.W.

https://openalex.org/W1970354154,"The heat shock response (HSR) is responsible for maintaining cellular and organismal health through the regulation of proteostasis. Recent data demonstrating that the mammalian HSR is regulated by SIRT1 suggest that this response may be under metabolic control. To test this hypothesis, we have determined the effect of caloric restriction in Caenorhabditis elegans on activation of the HSR and have found a synergistic effect on the induction of hsp70 gene expression. The homolog of mammalian SIRT1 in C. elegans is Sir2.1. Using a mutated C. elegans strain with a sir2.1 deletion, we show that heat shock and caloric restriction cooperate to promote increased survivability and fitness in a sir2.1-dependent manner. Finally, we show that caloric restriction increases the ability of heat shock to preserve movement in a polyglutamine toxicity neurodegenerative disease model and that this effect is dependent on sir2.1."
https://openalex.org/W2001803785,"Rictor and its binding partner Sin1 are indispensable components of mTORC2 (mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2). The mTORC2 signaling complex functions as the regulatory kinase of the distinct members of AGC kinase family known to regulate cell proliferation and survival. In the early chemotaxis studies in Dictyostelium, the rictor's ortholog has been identified as a regulator of cell migration. How rictor regulates cell migration is poorly characterized. Here we show that rictor regulates cell migration by controlling a potent inhibitor of Rho proteins known as the Rho-GDP dissociation inhibitor 2 (RhoGDI2). On the basis of on our proteomics study we identified that the rictor-dependent deficiency in cell migration is caused by upregulation of RhoGDI2 leading to a low activity of Rac and Cdc42. We found that a suppression of RhoGDI2 by rictor is not related to the Sin1 or raptor function that excludes a role of mTORC2 or mTORC1 in regulation of RhoGDI2. Our study reveals that rictor by suppressing RhoGDI2 promotes activity of the Rho proteins and cell migration."

Single cell migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), both of which are regulated by TGF-β, are critical steps in mediating cancer progression. Here, we sought to identify novel direct targets of TGF-β signaling in lung cancer cells and have indentified the zyxin gene as a target of Smad3-mediated TGF-β1 signaling. Zyxin concentrates at focal adhesions and along the actin cytoskeleton; as such, we hypothesized that cytoskeletal organization, motility, and EMT in response to TGF-β1 might be regulated by zyxin expression. We show that TGF-β1 treatment of lung cancer cells caused rapid phospho-Smad3-dependent expression of zyxin. Zyxin expression was critical for the formation and integrity of cell adherens junctions. Silencing of zyxin decreased expression of the focal adhesion protein vasodilator-activated phospho-protein (VASP), although the formation and morphology of focal adhesions remained unchanged. Zyxin-depleted cells displayed significantly increased integrin α5β1 levels, accompanied by enhanced adhesion to fibronectin and acquisition of a mesenchymal phenotype in response to TGF-β1. Zyxin silencing led to elevated integrin α5β1-dependent single cell motility. Importantly, these features are mirrored in the K-ras-driven mouse model of lung cancer. Here, lung tumors revealed decreased levels of both zyxin and phospho-Smad3 when compared with normal tissues. Our data thus demonstrate that zyxin is a novel functional target and effector of TGF-β signaling in lung cancer. By regulating cell-cell junctions, integrin α5β1 expression, and cell-extracellular matrix adhesion, zyxin may regulate cancer cell motility and EMT during lung cancer development and progression.

https://openalex.org/W2020753350,"Notch signaling is critical for development and adult tissue physiology, controlling cell fate in a context-dependent manner. Upon ligand binding, the transmembrane Notch receptor undergoes two ordered proteolytic cleavages releasing Notch intracellular domain, which regulates the transcription of Notch target genes. The strength of Notch signaling is of crucial importance and depends notably on the quantity of Notch receptor at the cell surface. Using an shRNA library screen monitoring Notch trafficking and degradation in the absence of ligand, we identified mammalian USP12 and its Drosophila melanogaster homolog as novel negative regulators of Notch signaling. USP12 silencing specifically interrupts Notch trafficking to the lysosomes and, as a consequence, leads to an increased amount of receptor at the cell surface and to a higher Notch activity. At the biochemical level, USP12 with its activator UAF1 deubiquitinate the nonactivated form of Notch in cell culture and in vitro. These results characterize a new level of conserved regulation of Notch signaling by the ubiquitin system."

Heparin is a commonly used anticoagulant drug that inhibits the activities of factors Xa and IIa (also known as thrombin) to prevent blood clot formation.

HS is involved in regulating numerous biological processes such as blood coagulation, embryonic development, inflammatory responses, and assisting viral/bacterial infections (1.Bishop J.R. Schuksz M. Esko J.D. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans fine-tune mammalian physiology.Nature. 2007; 446: 1030-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (1267) Google Scholar). The disaccharide-building block for HS consists of GlcUA or IdoUA and glucosamine, each of which is capable of carrying sulfo groups. The position of the sulfo groups and the location of the IdoUA units dictate the functions of HS (2.Kreuger J. Spillmann D. Li J.P. Lindahl U. Interactions between heparan sulfate and proteins: the concept of specificity.J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). The biosynthesis of HS occurs in the Golgi apparatus and involves several specialized sulfotransferases, glycosyltransferases, and an epimerase (3.Peterson S. Frick A. Liu J. Design of biologically active heparan sulfate and heparin using an enzyme-based approach.Nat. Prod. Rep. 2009; 26: 610-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). HS polymerase, known as EXT-1 and EXT-2, is responsible for building the polysaccharide backbone, containing repeating units of -GlcUA-GlcNAc-. The backbone is then modified by N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase (which has two separate domains displaying the activity of N-deacetylase and N-sulfotransferase, respectively), C5-epimerase (which converts GlcUA to IdoUA), 2-O-sulfotransferase, 6-O-sulfotransferase, and 3-O-sulfotransferase to produce HS. heparan sulfate antithrombin α-d-N-sulfoglucosamine O-sulfotransferase P. multocida heparosan synthase 2 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate N-trifluoroacetylglucosamine anhydromannitol N-trifluoroacetylated electrospray ionization platelet factor 4 ultra low molecular weight. Heparin, a commonly used anticoagulant drug, is a specialized form of HS with higher levels of sulfation and IdoUA. It has remained as a top choice for treating thrombotic disorders for >50 years. Heparin achieves its anticoagulant activity by forming a 1:1 complex with antithrombin (AT). The resultant AT-heparin complex inhibits a series of proteases in the blood coagulation cascade, including factor Xa and thrombin (or factor IIa), to prevent the formation of blood clots. The heparin-exerting Xa inhibition effect requires the presence of a pentasaccharide domain with the structure of -GlcNAc6S-GlcUA-GlcNS3S±6S-IdoUA2S-GlcNS6S-, whereas the inhibition of IIa requires oligosaccharides larger than tetradecasaccharides (14-mer); the precise structures for oligosaccharides with anti-IIa activity are unknown (4.Atha D.H.

Heparin is currently isolated from porcine intestine or bovine lung through a poorly regulated supply chain. The worldwide distribution of contaminated heparin in 2007 raised concern over the safety and reliability of animal-sourced heparins (6.Liu H. Zhang Z. Linhardt R.J.

A cost-effective method for preparing synthetic heparin and securing the safety of the heparin supply chain is highly desirable. Although heparin and HS fragments can be synthesized by a purely chemical method (8.Arungundram S. Al-Mafraji K. Asong J. Leach 3rd, F.E. Amster I.J. Venot A. Turnbull J.E. Boons G.J.

In this work, we attempted to synthesize oligosaccharides with anti-IIa activity using the chemoenzymatic approach. A series of size-defined N-sulfo-oligosaccharides were synthesized using bacterial glycosyltransferase, an unnatural UDP-sugar, and N-sulfotransferase with high efficiency and purity. We demonstrate for the first time the preparation of oligosaccharides with up to 21 saccharide residues. We converted these N-sulfo-oligosaccharides to O-sulfated oligosaccharides to measure their anti-Xa and anti-IIa activities. Our data suggest that the minimum size for the oligosaccharides to present anti-IIa activity is 19 residues long and that a size of 21 saccharide residues is required to display full anti-IIa activity. The results will assist our long-term efforts to prepare synthetic heparin and HS with desired biological activities and structural controls. A total of eight enzymes were used for the synthesis, including N-sulfotransferase, C5-epimerase, 2-O-sulfotransferase (2-OST), 6-OST-1, 6-OST-3, 3-OST-1, KfiA, and Pasteurella multocida heparosan synthase 2 (pmHS2). All enzymes were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by appropriate affinity chromatography as described previously (13.Liu R. Xu Y. Chen M. Weïwer M. Zhou X. Bridges A.S. DeAngelis P.L.

A sulfo donor, 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS), was prepared using adenosine phosphokinase and ATP-sulfurylase (13.Liu R. Xu Y. Chen M. Weïwer M. Zhou X. Bridges A.S. DeAngelis P.L.

The preparation of UDP-N-trifluoroacetylglucosamine (GlcNTFA) was started from glucosamine (Sigma), which was first converted to GlcNTFA by reacting with S-ethyl trifluorothioacetate (Sigma) following the protocol described previously (13.Liu R. Xu Y. Chen M. Weïwer M. Zhou X. Bridges A.S. DeAngelis P.L. Zhang Q. Linhardt R.J. Liu J. Chemoenzymatic design of heparan sulfate oligosaccharides.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 34240-34249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The resultant GlcNTFA was converted to GlcNTFA 1-phosphate using N-acetylhexosamine 1-kinase (15.Zhao G. Guan W. Cai L. Wang P.G. Enzymatic route to preparative-scale synthesis of UDP-GlcNAc/GalNAc, their analogs, and GDP-fucose.Nat. Protoc. 2010; 5: 636-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The plasmid expressing N-acetylhexosamine 1-kinase was a generous gift from Prof. Peng Wang (Georgia State University), and the expression of the enzyme was carried out in E. coli as reported (15.Zhao G. Guan W. Cai L. Wang P.G. Enzymatic route to preparative-scale synthesis of UDP-GlcNAc/GalNAc, their analogs, and GDP-fucose.Nat. Protoc. 2010; 5: 636-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The UDP-GlcNTFA synthesis was completed by transforming GlcNTFA 1-phosphate using glucosamine-1-phosphate acetyltransferase/N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GlmU) as described (13.Liu R. Xu Y. Chen M. Weïwer M. Zhou X. Bridges A.S. DeAngelis P.L. Zhang Q. Linhardt R.J. Liu J. Chemoenzymatic design of heparan sulfate oligosaccharides.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 34240-34249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The resultant UDP-GlcNTFA was then ready for the elongation reaction using KfiA as described below. A disaccharide (GlcUA-anhydromannitol (AnMan)) was prepared from heparosan as described (13.Liu R. Xu Y. Chen M. Weïwer M. Zhou X. Bridges A.S. DeAngelis P.L. Zhang Q. Linhardt R.J. Liu J. Chemoenzymatic design of heparan sulfate oligosaccharides.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 34240-34249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The disaccharide was then elongated to N-trifluoroacetylated (N-TFA) oligosaccharides by repetitive exposure to KfiA, pmHS2, UDP-GlcNTFA, and UDP-GlcUA as shown in Fig. 1. Briefly, the disaccharide (20 mg), KfiA (30 μg/ml), and UDP-GlcNTFA (500 μm) were mixed in 120 ml of 50 mm Tris buffer. The reaction was incubated overnight at room temperature. The completion of the reaction was monitored by the disappearance of UDP-GlcNTFA using a silica-based polyamine HPLC column (Waters). Once the reaction was completed, pmHS2 (30 μg/ml) and UDP-GlcUA (750 μm) were added, and the reaction was incubated for another 24 h at room temperature. The resultant product was a tetrasaccharide, which was purified using a Bio-Gel P-2 column (0.75 × 200 cm) that was equilibrated with 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate at a flow rate of 6 ml/h. The fractions were then subjected to electrospray ionization (ESI) MS analysis. The fractions containing the tetrasaccharide were pooled. The procedures for synthesizing the N-TFA pentadecasaccharide (15-mer), N-TFA heptadecasaccharide (17-mer), N-TFA nonadecasaccharide (19-mer), and N-TFA henicosasaccharide (21-mer) were essentially the same, completed by repeating the above cycle with the designated times. When the backbone was elongated beyond octasaccharide, a special method was employed to deplete UDP-GlcNTFA and UDP-GlcNAc prior to further elongation by pmHS2. If unreacted UDP-GlcNTFA or UDP-GlcNAc was present in the GlcUA elongation step involving pmHS2, an uncontrolled elongation occurred, resulting in a mixture. It was therefore especially important to avoid the formation of mixtures when the synthesis reached octasaccharide and beyond because the P-2 column cannot separate oligosaccharides larger than octasaccharides. To this end, the disaccharide GlcUA-AnMan was added to the reaction to exhaust the residual UDP-GlcNTFA and GlcNAc at the reaction, and the resultant trisaccharide was removed using the P-2 column. Oligosaccharide backbones (1–2 mg) were resuspended in solution (20 ml) containing 2:2:1 (v/v/v) CH3OH, H2O, and (C2H5)3N. The reaction was incubated overnight at 50 °C. The samples were dried and reconstituted in H2O to recover de-N-TFA oligosaccharides. N-Sulfation of oligosaccharides was carried out by incubating the oligosaccharide substrates with N-sulfotransferase and PAPS. The reaction mixture typically contained 1–2 mg of de-N-TFA oligosaccharide, 500 μm PAPS, 50 mm MES (pH 7.0), and 1 mg of N-sulfotransferase in a total volume of 15 ml. The reaction mixture was incubated overnight at 37 °C. The conversion of N-sulfo-oligosaccharides to the final products involved three steps, including C5-epimerization/2-O-sulfation, 6-O-sulfation, and 3-O-sulfation. N-Sulfo-oligosaccharides (1–2 mg) were incubated in a reaction mixture containing 50 mm MES (pH 7.0), 0.03 mg/ml C5-epimerase, and 2 mm CaCl2 in a total volume of 40 ml. After incubation for 30 min at 37 °C, 2-OST (0.03 mg/ml) and 200 μm PAPS were added, and the reaction was incubated overnight at 37 °C. The products were purified using a DEAE column as described previously (14.Xu Y. Masuko S. Takieddin M. Xu H. Liu R. Jing J. Mousa S.A. Linhardt R.J. Liu J. Chemoenzymatic synthesis of homogeneous ultra low molecular weight heparins.Science. 2011; 334: 498-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). For 6-O-sulfation, the substrate was incubated overnight at 37 °C in a reaction mixture containing 50 mm MES (pH 7.0) and 500 μm PAPS in the presence of 6-OST-1 (0.03 mg/ml) and 6-OST-3 (0.03 mg/ml) in a total volume of 20 ml. The products were purified using a DEAE column. For 3-O-sulfation, the substrate was incubated overnight at 37 °C in a reaction mixture containing 3-OST-1 (0.03 mg/ml), 10 mm MnCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, and 500 μm PAPS in a total volume of 20 ml. Analyses were performed with a Thermo Scientific LCQ-Deca system. The non-sulfated oligosaccharide (1 μl) eluted from Bio-Gel P-2 column was directly diluted in 200 μl of 9:1 MeOH/H2O. A syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus) was used to introduce the sample via direct infusion (35 μl/min). Experiments were carried out in negative ionization mode with the electrospray source set to 5 kV and 275 °C. The sulfated oligosaccharide (1 μl) was diluted in a different working solution containing 200 μl of 70% acetonitrile and 10 mm imidazole. Experiments for sulfated oligosaccharides were carried out in negative ionization mode with the electrospray source set to 2 kV and 200 °C. The automatic gain control was set to 1 × 107 for full-scan MS. The MS data were acquired and processed using Xcalibur 1.3. Assays were based on a previously published method (16.Zhang L. Beeler D.L.

Briefly, factor Xa (Enzyme Research Laboratories, South Bend, IN) and thrombin (Sigma) were diluted at 80 and 100 nm, respectively, with PBS containing 1 mg/ml BSA. Human AT (Cutter Biological) was diluted with PBS containing 1 mg/ml BSA to give a stock solution at a concentration of 0.4 μm. The chromogenic substrates S-2765 (for factor Xa assay) and S-2238 (for factor IIa assay) were prepared at 1.3 and 1.5 mm in water. The synthesized oligosaccharides or heparin was dissolved in PBS at various concentrations (1–30 nm). The reaction mixture, which consisted of 70 μl of AT stock solution and 15 μl of sample solution, was incubated at room temperature for 2 min. Factor Xa or thrombin (10 μl) was added. After incubation at room temperature for 4 min, 30 μl of S-2765 or S-2238 was added. The initial reaction rates as a function of concentration were used to calculate the IC50 values. The absorbance of the reaction mixture was measured at 405 nm continuously for 10 min. The absorbance values were plotted against the reaction time. The initial reaction rates as a function of concentration were used to calculate the IC50 values. A filter-trapping assay was used to compare the binding of the different oligosaccharides to platelet factor 4 (PF4) (18.Stringer S.E. Gallagher J.T. Specific binding of the chemokine platelet factor 4 to heparan sulfate.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20508-20514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The 35S-labeled oligosaccharides (∼6000 cpm) were incubated with 0–15 μg/ml PF4 in 50 mm Tris and 250 mm NaCl (pH 7.3) for 30 min at 37 °C to allow complex formation. The mixture was then spotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane, which binds to proteins nonspecifically, allowing the capture of complexes of PF4 and 35S-labeled oligosaccharide. The membrane wells were washed with buffer and excised, and the bound radioactivity was quantified using a scintillation counter. HS oligosaccharides were incubated in a 96-well plate with 70 μl of BSA (1 mg/ml in PBS), 10 μl of AT (0.2 mg/ml in PBS), and 0–16 μl of PF4 (0.45 mg/ml) for 2 min at room temperature. Ten microliters of Xa was then added, and after 4 min, 30 μl of chromogenic substrate S-2765 (1 mg/ml) was added to initiate the color change reaction. Sequential absorbance readings at 405 nm were started immediately using a Bio-Tek ELx808 plate reader. The rate of increased absorbance relative to the rate of a control sample was used to define Xa activity. Quantities of oligosaccharides showing ∼8% Xa activity in the absence of PF4 were used. Both DEAE-HPLC and polyamine-based anion exchange HPLC were used to determine the purity of the oligosaccharides. The elution conditions for the HPLC analysis have been described elsewhere (13.Liu R. Xu Y. Chen M. Weïwer M. Zhou X. Bridges A.S. DeAngelis P.L. Zhang Q. Linhardt R.J. Liu J. Chemoenzymatic design of heparan sulfate oligosaccharides.J. Biol.

The 35S-labeled compound was deacetylated and degraded with nitrous acid at pH 4.5 and then at pH 1.5, followed by reduction with sodium borohydride as described by Shively and Conrad (19.Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Formation of anhydrosugars in the chemical depolymerization of heparin.Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3932-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). The resultant 35S-labeled disaccharides were resolved using a C18 reverse-phase column (0.46 × 25 cm; Vydac) under reverse-phase ion-pairing HPLC conditions. The identities of the disaccharides were determined by co-elution with the appropriate 35S-labeled disaccharide standards. Although a pentasaccharide is sufficiently large to exhibit anti-Xa activity (4.Atha D.H. Lormeau J.C. Petitou M. Rosenberg R.D. Choay J.

The architecture of the IIa inhibitor is believed to contain a domain that binds to AT, a domain that binds to IIa, and a linker domain consisting of low sulfated (or non-sulfated) -GlcUA-GlcNAc- repeating units (Fig. 1) (20.Petitou M. Hérault J.P. Bernat A. Driguez P.A. Duchaussoy P. Lormeau J.C. Herbert J.M. Synthesis of thrombin-inhibiting heparin mimetics without side effects.Nature. 1999; 398: 417-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Our first step toward the synthesis of HS oligosaccharides carrying anti-IIa activity involved synthesizing the oligosaccharide backbone with specific N-sulfo distribution. This unique N-sulfation pattern permitted the subsequent C5-epimerization and O-sulfations to yield products with three segments: an AT-binding domain, a linker domain, and a thrombin-binding domain (as shown in Fig. 1). The synthesis was initiated from a disaccharide, which was elongated to the desired size using two bacterial glycosyltransferases, N-acetylglucosamine transferase from E. coli strain K5 (KfiA) and pmHS2 (14.Xu Y. Masuko S. Takieddin M. Xu H. Liu R. Jing J. Mousa S.A. Linhardt R.J. Liu J. Chemoenzymatic synthesis of homogeneous ultra low molecular weight heparins.Science. 2011; 334: 498-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). During the synthesis, GlcNTFA residues were strategically introduced into the backbone, where the AT-binding and IIa-binding domains are located, as the N-TFA group is readily converted to an N-sulfo group by a chemoenzymatic approach. The linker region contains GlcNAc residues. A total of four N-TFA oligosaccharides were synthesized from a decasaccharide designated as the “AT-binding site and linker backbone” (Fig. 1). The structural difference in the four N-TFA oligosaccharides was that each oligosaccharide contained distinct numbers of the -GlcUA-GlcNTFA- repeating unit in the IIa-binding domain. It should be noted that all four compounds contain very similar structures in the AT-binding and linker domains. The size of the -GlcUA-GlcNTFA- repeating unit was controlled by the cycles of modifications using KfiA and pmHS2. For example, the preparation of the N-TFA pentadecasaccharide (15-mer) involved five enzymatic steps (three KfiA modification steps and two pmHS2 modification steps), whereas the synthesis of the N-TFA henicosasaccharide (21-mer) required 11 enzymatic steps (six KfiA modification steps and five pmHS2 modification steps). The N-TFA oligosaccharides were synthesized in milligram scales. The N-TFA oligosaccharides were next converted to N-sulfo-oligosaccharides in two steps: alkaline detrifluoroacetylation and treatment with N-sulfotransferase. To this end, four N-sulfated oligosaccharides, ranging from pentadeca- to henicosasaccharides (1-4), were obtained. The purity of the N-sulfation products was analyzed by high resolution DEAE-HPLC analysis, and their molecular weights were determined by ESI-MS. As shown in Fig. 2A, the 35S-labeled N-sulfo-henicosasaccharide (4) was eluted in a predominant single symmetric peak, suggesting that the compound is substantially pure. The results of the ESI-MS analysis revealed the molecular weight of Compound 4 to be 4263.2 ± 1.0, very close to the calculated value of 4261.5, suggesting that Compound 4 is a henicosasaccharide carrying eight sulfo groups (Fig. 2B and Table 1). We completed the purity analysis using DEAE-HPLC and molecular weight determination using ESI analysis (supplemental Figs. S1–S3) for Compounds 1-3. All of these N-sulfo-oligosaccharides had the anticipated molecular weights (Table 1) and displayed high purity. Our data suggest that we obtained the expected products.TABLE 1Summary of the analysis of N-sulfo-oligosaccharides by MSMrCompoundNameAbbreviated structureCalculatedMeasured1N-Sulfo-pentadecasaccharide (15-mer)GlcNS-(GlcUA-GlcNS)2-(GlcUA-GlcNAc)2-(GlcUA-GlcNS)2-GlcUA-AnMan3009.53010.5 ± 1.12N-Sulfo-heptadecasaccharide (17-mer)GlcNS-(GlcUA-GlcNS)3-(GlcUA-GlcNAc)2-(GlcUA-GlcNS)2-GlcUA-AnMan3426.83428.1 ± 1.03N-Sulfo-nonadecasaccharide (19-mer)GlcNS-(GlcUA-GlcNS)4-(GlcUA-GlcNAc)2-(GlcUA-GlcNS)2-GlcUA-AnMan3844.23846.2 ± 1.24N-Sulfo-henicosasaccharide (21-mer)GlcNS-(GlcUA-GlcNS)5-(GlcUA-GlcNAc)2-(GlcUA-GlcNS)2-GlcUA-AnMan4261.54263.2 ± 1.0 Open table in a new tab Incubation of N-sulfo-oligosaccharides with C5-epimerase, 2-OST, 6-OST, and 3-OST yielded oligosaccharides containing IdoUA and 2-O-, 6-O-, and 3-O-sulfations (Fig. 1). Unlike the N-sulfo-oligosaccharides, a mixture of oligosaccharides was obtained after O-sulfations and C5-epimerization (9.Hu Y.P. Lin S.Y. Huang C.Y. Zulueta M.M. Liu J.Y. Chang W. Hung S.C. Synthesis of 3-O-sulfonated heparan sulfate octasaccharides that inhibit the herpes simplex virus type 1 host-cell interaction.Nat. Chem. 2011; 3: 557-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). We observed that the products were eluted as a broad peak on DEAE-HPLC (supplemental Fig. S4). The resultant mixture is largely due to the incomplete modifications at the epimerization and 2-O-sulfation steps. In addition, the C5-epimerization reactions are likely to be reversible, making the control of the placement of IdoUA and 2-O-sulfation in these large oligosaccharides very difficult. A recent study demonstrated that C5-epimerase displays both reversible and irreversible catalytic modes (21.Sheng J. Xu Y. Dulaney S.B. Huang X. Liu J. Uncovering biphasic catalytic mode of C5-epimerase in heparan sulfate biosynthesis.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 20996-21002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). It is apparent that C5-epimerase recognizes the N-sulfation patterns of the polysaccharide substrates to control the location/placement of IdoUA residues. The full biological implications of the biphasic catalytic mode of C5-epimerase are currently unknown. Structural characterization of Compounds 5-8 was completed by disaccharide analyses (TABLE 2, TABLE 3). These oligosaccharides were 35S-labeled at 2-O-sulfo, 6-O-sulfo, and 3-O-sulfo groups. To more accurately examine the compositions of the products, two approaches were used to degrade the oligosaccharides to disaccharides, including heparin lyase degradation and nitrous acid degradation (TABLE 2, TABLE 3). Prior to the 3-O-sulfation step, these oligosaccharides were subjected to the heparin lyase degradation. Based on the specific 35S radioactivity of [35S]PAPS, we estimated that the O-sulfation levels in these compounds (prior to 3-O-sulfation) were in the range of 1.2–1.5 O-sulfo groups (Table 2). The results from the disaccharide analysis (Table 2) confirmed the estimated O-sulfation levels.TABLE 2Summary of disaccharide analysis of the 15–17-mers without 3-O-sulfation degraded by heparin lyases15-mer without 3-O-sulfation17-mer without 3-O-sulfation19-mer without 3-O-sulfation21-mer without 3-O-sulfationΔUA-GlcNAc6S30.9%30.0%24.3%26.6%ΔUA-GlcNS6S31.0%27.0%17.4%35.6%ΔUA2S-GlcNS<1%<1%1.5%2.1%ΔUA2S-GlcNS6S38.0%43.0%57.6%35.6%O-Sulfo group/disaccharideaThe number of O-sulfo groups per disaccharide was determined based on the specific 35S radioactivity of [35S]PAPS.1.4 (1.2)bThe numbers given in parentheses are the values based on disaccharide analysis.1.5 (1.4)1.5 (1.6)1.5 (1.4)a The number of O-sulfo groups per disaccharide was determined based on the specific 35S radioactivity of [35S]PAPS.b The numbers given in parentheses are the values based on disaccharide analysis.

Here, we identify protein arginine methyltransferase 6 (PRMT6) as a central functional component of a RUNX1 corepressor complex containing Sin3a and HDAC1 in human hematopoietic progenitor cells. PRMT6 is recruited by RUNX1 and mediates asymmetric histone H3 arginine-2 dimethylation (H3R2me2a) at megakaryocytic genes in progenitor cells. H3R2me2a keeps RUNX1 target genes in an intermediate state with concomitant H3K27me3 and H3K4me2 but not H3K4me3. Upon megakaryocytic differentiation PRMT6 binding is lost, the H3R2me2a mark decreases and a coactivator complex containing WDR5/MLL and p300/pCAF is recruited. This leads to an increase of H3K4me3 and H3K9ac, which result in augmented gene expression. Our results provide novel mechanistic insight into how RUNX1 activity in hematopoietic progenitor cells maintains differentiation genes in a suppressed state but poised for rapid transcriptional activation."

Apocalmodulin (apo-CaM) weakly activates RyR1 but inhibits RyR2, whereas Ca(2+)-calmodulin inhibits both isoforms. Previous cryo-EM studies showed distinctly different binding locations on RyR1 for the two states of CaM. However, recent studies employing FRET appear to challenge these findings. Here, using cryo-EM, we have determined that a CaM mutant that is incapable of binding calcium binds to RyR1 at the apo site, regardless of the calcium concentration. We have also re-determined the location of RyR1-bound Ca(2+)-CaM using uniform experimental conditions. Our results show the existence of the two overlapping but distinct binding sites for CaM in RyR1 and imply that the binding location switch is due to Ca(2+) binding to CaM, as opposed to direct effects of Ca(2+) on RyR1. We also discuss explanations that could resolve the apparent conflict between the cryo-EM and FRET results. Interestingly, apo-CaM binds to RyR2 at a similar binding location to that of Ca(2+)-CaM on RyR1, in seeming agreement with the inhibitory effects of these two forms of CaM on their respective receptors."

Tank−/− mice spontaneously develop autoimmune glomerular nephritis in an IL-6-dependent manner. Despite its importance in the TCRs and BCR-activated TRAF6 inhibition, the involvement of TANK in RANKL signaling is poorly understood. Here, we report that TANK is a negative regulator of osteoclast differentiation. The expression levels of TANK mRNA and protein were up-regulated during RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis, and overexpression of TANK in vitro led to a decrease in osteoclast formation. The in vitro osteoclastogenesis of Tank−/− cells was significantly increased, accompanied by increased ubiquitination of TRAF6 and enhanced canonical NF-κB activation in response to RANKL stimulation. Tank−/− mice showed severe trabecular bone loss, but increased cortical bone mineral density, because of enhanced bone erosion and formation. TANK mRNA expression was induced during osteoblast differentiation and Tank−/− osteoblasts exhibited enhaced NF-κB activation, IL-11 expression, and bone nodule formation than wild-type control cells. Finally, wild-type mice transplanted with bone marrow cells from Tank−/− mice showed trabecular bone loss analogous to that in Tank−/− mice.

The canonical NF-κB pathway activates heterodimers of RelA/p65 and p50, which is generated from the NF-κB1/p105 fragment, while the non-canonical pathway induces processing of the NF-κB2/p100 fragment into active p52. Following the activation of such transcription factors, osteoclast differentiation is induced by the induction of osteoclastic genes, such as TRAP, calcitonin R, and DC-STAMP. Among these osteoclastic genes, DC-STAMP is known to be involved in cell-cell fusion, because osteoclast and IL-3 plus IL-4-induced multinucleated giant cell formation by macrophage cell fusion is abrogated in DC-STAMP-deficient mice (6.Yagi M.

Collectively, it has been proposed that RANKL-RANK interactions and the subsequent signaling via TRAF6 are important for the differentiation of osteoclasts. Various cytokines and cellular stresses are known to activate intracellular signaling pathways leading to NF-κB activation. This transcription factor is well known to control the expressions of proinflammatory cytokines downstream of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and IL-1 receptor (IL-1R). TLRs directly sense the presence of microbial components and trigger intracellular signaling pathways that evoke innate immune responses against pathogens. Activation of TLRs leads to the recruitment of the adaptor molecule MyD88, which in turn activates IL-1R-associated kinases (IRAKs). TRAF6 is ubiquitinated downstream of IRAK-1/-2, and activates NF-κB by generating unconjugated polyubiquitin chains and activating TAK1 (13.Akira S. Uematsu S. Takeuchi O.

Despite the importance of TRAF6 in the RANKL signaling, the involvement of TANK in RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation and bone homeostasis is poorly understood. In this study, we found that TANK was induced during RANKL-mediated osteoclastogenesis, and overexpression of TANK led to a decrease in osteoclast formation. Tank−/− macrophages underwent increased osteoclastogenesis mediated by enhanced ubiquitination of TRAF6, the canonical NF-κB pathway, and c-Fos and NFATc1 activation. Tank−/− mice showed trabecular bone loss, but increased cortical bone mineral density (BMD) and resistance to bone fracture, because of enhanced bone erosion and formation. Interestingly, TANK was also induced in osteoblasts and Tank−/− osteoblasts formed more bone nodules. These findings provide unexpected insights into the roles of TANK in bone remodeling. Tank−/− mice on a C57BL/6 background were generated as previously described (19.Kawagoe T. Takeuchi O. Takabatake Y. Kato H. Isaka Y. Tsujimura T. Akira S.

All animal experiments were carried out under approval from the Animal Research Committee of the Research Institute for Microbial Diseases (Osaka University, Osaka, Japan). For stromal cell-free in vitro osteoclast cultures, M-CSF-derived macrophages (MDMs) were used as osteoclast precursors. Bone marrow cells were flushed from femurs or tibias and cultured for 6 h in α-MEM containing 10% FCS. Non-adherent cells were collected and plated in 48-well plates at a density of 1.2 × 105 cells/well with 25 ng/ml M-CSF (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ). After 3 days, the cultures were washed with PBS and adherent cells were used as MDMs. The MDMs were induced to differentiate into osteoclasts in the presence of 25 ng/ml M-CSF and various concentrations of RANKL (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). After 3 days, the adherent cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, treated with ethanol/acetone (50:50, v/v), and stained for TRAP using a TRAP/ALP staining kit (Wako, Tokyo, Japan). The numbers of TRAP-positive multinucleated cells were counted. The osteoclast area (percentage of TRAP-positive multinucleated cells relative to the total area) was measured using the software ImageJ (software from NIH). For pit assays, ivory dentine slices (Wako, Tokyo, Japan) were placed in 48-well plates. MDMs were cultured on the dentine slices, and then cultured in 25 ng/ml M-CSF and 50 ng/ml RANKL to induce osteoclast differentiation. After 5 days, the dentine slices were immersed in 1 m NH4OH for 3 h and sonicated to remove the cells. The resorption pits were observed by scanning electron microscopy (MiniScope TM-1000; Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). Quantitative analyses of the resorption pits were performed using ImageJ. A murine TANK cDNA was cloned into the pLZR-IRES/GFP retroviral vector (21.Satoh T. Kato H. Kumagai Y. Yoneyama M. Sato S. Matsushita K. Tsujimura T. Fujita T. Akira S. Takeuchi O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 1512-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). The construct was transfected into the packaging cell line PlatE, and viral supernatants were collected. Bone marrow cells from C57BL/6 mice were cultured for 6 h in α-MEM. Subsequently, non-adherent cells were collected and plated in 24-well plates at a density of 1 × 106 cells/well with 25 ng/ml M-CSF. After 24 h, the cells were transduced with a retroviral supernatant in the presence of 8 μg/ml polybrene for 8 h. Following culture for 48 h in the presence of 25 ng/ml M-CSF, the cells were cultured with 25 ng/ml M-CSF and 50 ng/ml RANKL. After 3 days, the numbers of TRAP-positive multinucleated cells were counted. MDMs (5 × 106) were stimulated with 50 ng/ml LPS, TNF-α, or RANKL for various times. The cells were then lysed in a lysis buffer comprising 20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1.0% Nonidet P40, 150 mm NaCl, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). The cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylfluoride membranes. The membranes were incubated with anti-TANK (H-300; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-p100/p52 (#4882; Cell Signaling), anti-TRAF6 (sc-7221; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Ub (P4D1; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-actin (C-11; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies. After the incubation, membranes were washed and incubated with HRP-linked anti-rabbit IgG (NA934V; GE Healthcare) or HRP-linked anti-mouse IgG (NA931V; GE Healthcare). For chemiluminescence, membranes were incubated with fresh Western lightning Plus-ECL reagents (Perkin Elmer). TRAF6 immunoprecipitation and detection of its ubiquitination were performed as described previously (19.Kawagoe T. Takeuchi O. Takabatake Y. Kato H. Isaka Y. Tsujimura T. Akira S. TANK is a negative regulator of Toll-like receptor signaling and is critical for the prevention of autoimmune nephritis.Nat. Immunol. 2009; 10: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Cells from wild-type and Tank−/− mice were stained with trypan blue, and the numbers of viable cells were counted under a light microscope. Apoptotic cells were determined using a Poly Caspase Assay Kit, Green FLICA (ImmunoChemistry Technologies, Bloomington, MN). MDMs (1 × 106) were stimulated with 350 ng/ml RANKL for 30 min. Nuclear extracts were purified from the cells and the DNA binding activity of NF-κB p65 was analyzed using a TransAM Transcription Factor Assay Kit (Active Motive, Carlsbad, CA). Primary osteoblasts were isolated from the calvariae of 2-day-old mice. The calvariae were digested in α-MEM containing 0.1% collagenase and 0.2% dispase at 37 °C for 10 min. The cells were then expanded in α-MEM containing 10% FCS. For induction of osteoblastogenesis, primary osteoblasts were plated in 48-well plates at a density of 3 × 104 cells/well. After 1 day, the medium was supplemented with an Osteoblast-Inducer Reagent (Takara, Tokyo, Japan) containing ascorbic acid, hydrocortisone, and glycerophosphate. In some experiment, 10 μg/ml neutralizing antibodies to IL-6 or IL-11 (R&D) were added to the medium. The medium was changed every 3 days. After 9 days, calcified nodules and ALP were stained using a Calcified nodule Staining kit (AK-21; Primary Cell, Hokkaido, Japan) and TRAP/ALP staining kit (Wako, Tokyo, Japan), respectively. In some experiments, 5 mm NF-κB inhibitor BAY117085 (Sigma) was added at day 9 for 24 h, and mRNA was harvested. Bone marrow cells (3 × 105) and primary calvarial osteoblasts (5 × 105) were isolated and cultured in 24-well plates containing α-MEM supplemented with 10% FCS for 10 days in the presence of 10 nm 1α,25(OH)2D3. After the culture, the cells were fixed and stained for TRAP to evaluate the numbers of osteoclasts. RNA was extracted from cultured cells using TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and subjected to reverse transcription using ReverTra Ace (Toyobo, Tokyo, Japan). Quantitative PCR was performed with an ABI PRISM 7500 using TaqMan Assays-on-Demand primers and probes (Applied Biosystems) for TANK, TRAP, calcitonin R, c-Fos, NFATc1, DC-STAMP, RANK, Runx2, IL-11, OncostatinM, IL-6, RANKL, and osteoprotegerin (OPG). 18S control reagents were used for normalization of the cDNAs. Double calcein labeling was carried out to measure bone formation. Ten-week-old Tank−/− and age-matched control wild-type female mice were administered calcein intraperitoneally at 16 mg/kg body weight at 4 and 1 days before euthanasia. After euthanasia, the femurs are removed, fixed with 70% ethanol, and subjected to histomorphometric analyses. Three-dimensional μCT analysis of the femurs was conducted using Scan-Xmate RB080SS110 (Comscan Techno Co. Ltd., Kanagawa, Japan) and TRI/3D-Bon (Ratoc System Engineering Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) software. The cortical BMD and cortical area were measured by Dual Energy x-ray Absorptiometry DCS-600EX-IIIR (Aloka, Tokyo, Japan). To evaluate the cortical bone mechanical properties, the right femoral mid-shaft was tested by three-point bending using a mechanical testing machine (MZ-500S; Maruto, Tokyo, Japan). To test the bone mechanical properties, each femur was placed on two lower supports that were 6 mm apart and tested with a displacement rate of 2 mm/min until failure. The whole bone mechanical properties of maximum load (N), stiffness (N/mm), post-yield deflection (mm), and work to failure (N.mm) were measured. The bone microarchitectural parameters were analyzed in the trabecular regions from 0.1 to 1.5 mm away from the chondro-osseous junction. For bone histomorphometric analyses, the tibias or femurs were fixed with 70% ethanol, subjected to Villanueva bone staining, and embedded in methyl methacrylate. Serial longitudinal sections (6 mm in thickness) of proximal tibias and cross sections of proximal one-third of the right shaft of femurs were prepared using an RM2255 microtome (Leica, Jena, Germany). Metaphysis areas of tibias and endosteum/periosteum areas of femurs were analyzed using a Histometry RT Camera (System Supply Co. Ltd., Nagano, Japan). Donor bone marrow cells were collected from 6-week-old Tank−/− and age-matched control wild-type female mice. After suspension in PBS, 1 × 107 cells were intravenously injected into lethally irradiated 4-week-old wild-type recipient mice (C57BL/6 background). The chimeric mice were given neomycin and ampicillin in their drinking water for 4 weeks. The mice were analyzed at 7 weeks after the bone marrow transplantation. Cultured calvarial osteoblasts were homogenized with 0.1% Triton X-100, and the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity was measured using a kit (LabAssay; Wako). The serum ALP levels were also measured using the same kit. The serum levels of TRACP5b were measured using a TRACP5b ELISA Kit (Immunodiagnostic Systems, Bolden, UK). Serum levels of Cross Linked C-Telopeptide of Type I collagen (CTX-I) were measured by ELISA Kit (USCN Life Science, Wuhan, China). All assays were performed according to the corresponding manufacturer's protocols. The significance of differences between values was analyzed by Student's t test. Values of p < 0.05 were accepted as statistically significant. First, we examined the expression pattern of TANK during the course of RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis. TANK mRNA expression was markedly increased after 24 h of RANKL stimulation in MDMs, and then decreased to the pre-stimulation level by 48 h of RANKL treatment (Fig. 1A). TANK protein expression gradually increased during osteoclastogenesis, and its expression level reached nearly 5-fold after 72 h of RANKL stimulation (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, not only RANKL but also LPS and TNF induced TANK expression in MDMs (Fig. 1C). These findings prompted us to explore the role of TANK during osteoclastogenesis. To investigate the role of TANK deficiency in osteoclastogenesis, we analyzed in vitro osteoclastogenesis using wild-type and Tank−/− MDMs. We treated the MDMs with increasing concentrations of RANKL, and TRAP-positive multinucleated cells were identified as mature osteoclasts after 3 days. RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis was augmented in Tank−/− cells compared with wild-type cells, and the number of osteoclasts was increased by ∼60%. Furthermore, Tank−/− osteoclasts had increased numbers of nuclei and were larger in size (Fig. 2, A–D). TANK deficiency did not alter the proliferation or apoptosis of MDMs (Fig. 2, F and G). Next, we compared the bone resorption activities of osteoclasts from wild-type and Tank−/− MDMs using pit assays. When wild-type and Tank−/− MDMs were cultured on dentine slices with RANKL for 5 days, they formed resorption pits. However, the total bone resorption pit area for Tank−/− osteoclasts normalized by osteoclast number was greater than that for wild-type MDMs (Fig. 2E), indicating that TANK inhibits the bone resorption activity of bone marrow-derived osteoclasts. To further substantiate the effect of TANK deficiency on osteoclastogenesis, we examined the expression levels of mRNAs encoding osteoclast-related genes after 0, 24, and 72 h of RANKL stimulation. Consistent with the findings for osteoclastogenesis, the expression profiles revealed that osteoclast-associated genes, including NFATc1, c-Fos, TRAP, calcitonin R, and DC-STAMP, were significantly increased in Tank−/− cells compared with wild-type cells (Fig. 3, A–E). Collectively, these findings suggest that TANK negatively regulates osteoclast differentiation in cultured bone marrow cells. To explore the effect of gain of function of TANK in osteoclastogenesis, we overexpressed TANK in MDMs using a retroviral vector. As shown in Fig. 4A, wild-type MDMs overexpressing TANK did not sufficiently differentiate into osteoclasts, and the number of TRAP-positive multinucleated cells (Fig. 4, A and B). Further, retrovirus reconstitution of TANK in Tank−/− MDMs suppressed RANKL induced osteoclastogenesis to the same level as wild-type (Fig. 4, A and B). These findings indicate that the level of TANK expression is negatively correlated with osteoclastogenesis induced by RANKL treatment. To rule out the possibility that differential RANK expression is responsible for the augmented osteoclastogenesis under TANK deficiency, we examined the levels of RANK in MDMs. As shown in Fig. 4C, the RANK mRNA levels were comparable between wild-type and Tank−/− MDMs. FACS analyses revealed that the RANK+CD11b+ osteoclast precursor cell populations in the spleen were also comparable between wild-type and Tank−/− mice (supplemental Fig. S1). Next, we checked whether the loss of TANK promoted TRAF6 ubiquitination and NF-κB pathway activation in response to RANKL stimulation. TRAF6 ubiquitination in response to RANKL stimulation was increased in Tank−/− MDMs compared with wild-type controls (Fig. 4D). Furthermore, RANKL-induced DNA binding of the NF-κB p65 subunit was significantly elevated in Tank−/− MDMs (Fig. 4E). In contrast, p100 cleavage to p52, which indicates activation of the non-canonical NF-κB pathway, did not differ between wild-type and Tank−/− MDMs (Fig. 4F). These findings indicate that TANK negatively affects the RANKL-mediated canonical NF-κB pathway by suppressing TRAF6 activation. TANK may act as a negative feedback regulator of osteoclastogenesis. Next, we analyzed the in vivo bone phenotypes of wild-type and Tank−/− mice by μCT. First, we investigated the proximal femurs, and found no differences in the bone structures (Fig. 5A). However, the cortical area in the mid-shaft of the femurs was slightly increased in Tank−/− mice (Fig. 5B). This finding was further supported by increased BMD in the proximal end to mid-shaft in the femurs from Tank−/− mice (Fig. 5C). To determine whether the differences in BMD influenc"

The mechanism underlying the function of BRCA1 in suppressing basal-like breast cancer remains unclear. We previously reported that the deletion of p18Ink4c (p18), an inhibitor of G1 cyclin Ds-dependent CDK4 and CDK6, stimulates mammary luminal progenitor cell proliferation and leads to spontaneous luminal tumor development. We report here that germline mutation of Brca1 in p18-deficient mice blocks the increase of luminal progenitor cells, impairs luminal gene expression and promotes malignant transformation of mammary tumors. Instead of the luminal mammary tumors developed in p18 single-mutant mice, mammary tumors developed in the p18;Brca1 mice, similar to breast cancer developed in familial BRCA1 carriers, exhibited extensive basal-like features and lost the remaining wild-type allele of Brca1. These results reveal distinct functions of the RB and BRCA1 pathways in suppressing luminal and basal-like mammary tumors, respectively. These results also suggest a novel mechanism—causing luminal-to-basal transformation—for the development of basal-like breast cancer in familial BRCA1 carriers and establish a unique mouse model for developing therapeutic strategies to target both luminal and basal-like breast cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2036433764,"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells harboring activating mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tend to display elevated activity of several survival signaling pathways. Surprisingly, these mutations also correlate with reduced phosphorylation of ERK and SHP2, a protein tyrosine phosphatase required for complete ERK activation downstream of most receptor tyrosine kinases. As ERK activity influences cellular response to EGFR inhibition, altered SHP2 function could have a role in the striking response to gefitinib witnessed with EGFR mutation. Here, we demonstrate that impaired SHP2 phosphorylation correlates with diminished SHP2 function in NSCLC cells expressing mutant, versus wild-type, EGFR. In NSCLC cells expressing wild-type EGFR, SHP2 knockdown decreased ERK phosphorylation, basally and in response to gefitinib, and increased cellular sensitivity to gefitinib. In cells expressing EGFR mutants, these effects of SHP2 knockdown were less substantial, but the expression of constitutively active SHP2 reduced cellular sensitivity to gefitinib. In cells expressing EGFR mutants, which do not undergo efficient ligand-mediated endocytosis, SHP2 was basally associated with GRB2-associated binder 1 (GAB1) and EGFR, and SHP2's presence in membrane fractions was dependent on EGFR activity. Whereas EGF promoted a more uniform intracellular distribution of initially centrally localized SHP2 in cells expressing wild-type EGFR, SHP2 was basally evenly distributed and did not redistribute in response to EGF in cells with EGFR mutation. Thus, EGFR mutation may promote association of a fraction of SHP2 at the plasma membrane with adapters that promote SHP2 activity. Consistent with this, SHP2 immunoprecipitated from cells with EGFR mutation was active, and EGF treatment did not change this activity. Overall, our data suggest that a fraction of SHP2 is sequestered at the plasma membrane in cells with EGFR mutation in a way that impedes SHP2's ability to promote ERK activity and identify SHP2 as a potential target for co-inhibition with EGFR in NSCLC."
https://openalex.org/W2013806654,"Autophagy is a tightly regulated lysosomal self-digestion process that can both promote and impede tumorigenesis. Here, we utilize a three-dimensional (3D) culture model to address how interactions between autophagy and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase(PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin pathway impact the malignant behavior of cells carrying a tumor-derived, activating mutation in PI3K (PI3K-H1047R). In this model, autophagy simultaneously mediates tumor-suppressive and -promoting functions within individual glandular structures. In 3D culture, constitutive PI3K activation overcomes proliferation arrest and promotes resistance to anoikis in the luminal space, resulting in aberrant structures with filled lumen. Inhibiting autophagy in PI3K-H1047R structures triggers luminal cell apoptosis, resulting in lumen clearance. At the same time, autophagy gene depletion strongly enhances PI3K-H1047R cell proliferation during 3D morphogenesis, revealing an unexpected role for autophagy in restricting proliferation driven by PI3K activation. Intriguingly, overexpression of the autophagy cargo receptor p62/SQSTM1 in PI3K-H1047R cells is sufficient to enhance cell proliferation, activate the extracellular signal-related kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and to promote epidermal growth factor-independent proliferation in 3D culture. Overall, these results indicate that autophagy antagonizes specific aspects of oncogenic PI3K transformation, with the loss of autophagy promoting proliferation."

Resistance to anoikis is a primary feature of a cell that undergoes metastasis. In this study for the first time, we demonstrated the potential role of Gli1 in anoikis resistance. Treatment of various ovarian cancer cells by different concentrations of diindolylmethane (DIM), an active ingredient of cruciferous vegetables, reduced the anoikis resistance in a concentration-dependent manner. Reduction in anoikis resistance was associated with a decrease in the expression of Gli1 and an increase in the cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Sonic hedgehog (Shh) treatment not only increased the expression of Gli1, but also blocked anoikis induced by DIM and abrogated the change in the expression of Gli1 and cleaved PARP by DIM. To confirm the role of Gli1, hedgehog inhibitor cyclopamine, Gli1 siRNA and Gli1−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were used. Cyclopamine treatment alone significantly reduced anoikis resistance in A2780 and OVCAR-429 cells. Cyclopamine-mediated reduction in anoikis resistance was associated with reduced expression of Gli1 and induction of cleaved PARP. Shh treatment blocked cyclopamine-induced anoikis.

PML nuclear bodies are assembled through various interactions among PML protein isoforms. PML is the essential structural component of PML nuclear bodies (14Ishov A.M. Sotnikov A.G. Negorev D.

Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 221-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). It belongs to the so-called TRIM protein family, which is characterized by a tripartite motif called TRIM or RBCC that includes a Ring finger, one or two B-boxes, and a Coiled-Coil motif (15Jensen K.

Non-covalent interactions between sumo-conjugated PML and its sumo-interacting motif (SIM) allows the initial PML networks to “mature” into larger scaffolds. The co-existence of sumoylation sites and SIM in PML is crucial not only for the formation of the mature and functional PML-NBs but also for providing binding sites for nuclear proteins with a similar architecture, most prominently Sp100 (14Ishov A.M.

A few constitutive and more than 100 transiently binding proteins have been found to be localized to PML-NBs, many of which are mediated by the SUMO-SIM interaction network (22Maul G.G. Negorev D.

Biol. 2010; 2: a000661Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). As shown for most subnuclear domains (24Hemmerich P. Schmiedeberg L. Diekmann S. Dynamic as well as stable protein interactions contribute to genome function and maintenance.Chromosome Res. 2011; 19: 131-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), PML bodies assemble through self-organizing and self-propagating mechanisms (25Chung I. Leonhardt H. Rippe K. De novo assembly of a PML nuclear subcompartment occurs through multiple pathways and induces telomere elongation.J. Cell Sci. 2011; 124: 3603-3618Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The PML protein can be expressed as at least seven alternatively spliced isoforms. Except for isoform VII, which is cytoplasmic, PML isoforms I-VI are nuclear. These six nuclear PML isoforms share the same N-terminal region spanning amino acids 1–570 encoded by exons 1–6 and part of exon 7, which contains the RBCC motif and a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) (15Jensen K. Shiels C. Freemont P.S. PML protein isoforms and the RBCC/TRIM motif.Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7223-7233Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 26Reymond A. Meroni G. Fantozzi A. Merla G. Cairo S.

The tripartite motif family identifies cell compartments.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2140-2151Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). However, they differ in their C termini due to alternative splicing from exons 7 to 9 (Fig. 1A). PML-VI is the shortest nuclear isoform encoded only by exons 1–6; hence, it does not have a distinctive C terminus (Fig. 1A). All PML nuclear isoforms co-exist at PML nuclear bodies in cultured as well as primary cells (27Condemine W. Takahashi Y. Zhu J. Puvion-Dutilleul F. Guegan S. Janin A. de Thé H. Characterization of endogenous human promyelocytic leukemia isoforms.Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 6192-6198Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Increasing evidence suggests that the individual PML isoforms possess distinctive functions. PML-I and -II are considered to be the most abundant isoforms, and both are involved in restriction of virus replication (28Cuchet D. Sykes A. Nicolas A. Orr A. Murray J. Sirma H. Heeren J.

It participates in the regulation of cellular senescence, the DNA damage response, telomerase activity, and viral protein sequestration by specifically interacting with many important proteins such as p53, Mdm2, Tip60, and TERT (telomerase reverse transcriptase), suggesting the importance of its C terminus in mediating specific protein interactions (4Bischof O.

PML-V shows a 5-fold slower exchange rate at PML bodies than other isoforms, suggesting that its C terminus may contribute to PML body stability (40Weidtkamp-Peters S. Lenser T. Negorev D. Gerstner N. Hofmann T.G. Schwanitz G. Hoischen C. Maul G. Dittrich P. Hemmerich P. Dynamics of component exchange at PML nuclear bodies.J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 2731-2743Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The individual PML isoforms may also regulate the localization and morphology of PML-NBs (27Condemine W. Takahashi Y.

Expression of individual PML isoforms in various cellular backgrounds exhibited distinct nuclear localization patterns and can considerably alter the structure of PML bodies (24Hemmerich P. Schmiedeberg L. Diekmann S.

Cell Sci. 2011; 124: 3603-3618Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). For example, the appearance and function of PML nuclear bodies at very early stages of mouse embryo development may depend on the expression of specific PML isoforms (43Ebrahimian M. Mojtahedzadeh M. Bazett-Jones D. Dehghani H. Transcript isoforms of promyelocytic leukemia in mouse male and female gametes.Cells Tissues Organs. 2010; 192: 374-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Molecular analysis revealed that the C-terminal region of PML-I contains a nucleolar targeting sequence and a nuclear export sequence. These motifs mediate the relocalization of PML nuclear bodies into nucleoli or the cytoplasm, respectively (43Ebrahimian M. Mojtahedzadeh M. Bazett-Jones D. Dehghani H. Transcript isoforms of promyelocytic leukemia in mouse male and female gametes.Cells Tissues Organs. 2010; 192: 374-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 44Condemine W. Takahashi Y.

PML-IV and -V also contain a nucleolar targeting-like sequence (44Condemine W. Takahashi Y. Le Bras M. de Thé H. A nucleolar targeting signal in PML-I addresses PML to nucleolar caps in stressed or senescent cells.J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 3219-3227Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). PML-II contains a second NLS at its C terminus (41Beech S.J. Lethbridge K.J. Killick N. McGlincy N. Leppard K.N. Isoforms of the promyelocytic leukemia protein differ in their effects on ND10 organization.Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 307: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the C-terminal domains of PML isoforms may contribute to the functional and structural diversity of PML-NBs. However, the detailed mechanism is still lacking. In this study we report that the C-terminal domain of PML-II and PML-V can target to PML-NBs independent of their N-terminal regions and that they form nuclear bodies in the absence of endogenous PML. The C-terminal region of PML-V contains a putative α-helix segment that exhibits a strong homo-dimerization activity. Moreover, the nuclear bodies formed by the C-terminal domain of PML-V can recruit multiple PML-NB-associated proteins. These results implicate PML-V as an important PML isoform regulating the composition, formation, and stability of PML nuclear bodies. H1299, HEK293T cells, and PML−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified incubator supplied with 5% CO2. Dabco 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) was purchased from Beyotime. Antibodies used were GFP (Santa Cruz, B-2), α-tubulin (MBL, PM054), HP-1 (Abcam, ab77256), FLAG (Sigma, M2), PML (SAB, SAB375–2), and UBF (Santa Cruz). Plasmids expressing FLAG-PML-(I-V) were a kind gift from Lawrence Banks (29Guccione E. Lethbridge K.J. Killick N. Leppard K.N. Banks L. HPV E6 proteins interact with specific PML isoforms and allow distinctions to be made between different POD structures.Oncogene. 2004; 23: 4662-4672Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Plasmids expressing RFP-PML-(I-VI) and RFP-Sp100 were described previously (40Weidtkamp-Peters S. Lenser T. Negorev D. Gerstner N. Hofmann T.G. Schwanitz G. Hoischen C. Maul G. Dittrich P.

Assembly dynamics of PML nuclear bodies in living cells.PMC Biophys. 2010; 3: 3Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). GFP-CT (1–5) and GFP-nls-CT (1–5) were generated by PCR from the FLAG-PML-(I-V) plasmids and subcloned into pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) and pEGFP-C1-TAg-NLS. Plasmid pEGFP-C1-TAg-NLS was a kind gift of Dmitri Negorev (46Negorev D. Ishov A.M. Maul G.G. Evidence for separate ND10 binding and homo-oligomerization domains of Sp100.J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 59-68Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All mutants were constructed by standard molecular biology techniques. For yeast two-hybrid analysis, the C-terminal fragments of PML-II and -V were cloned into a yeast expressing vector pACT2 (Clontech), and the C-terminal fragments of PML-I-V and PML-VI were cloned into another yeast expressing vector pGBKT7 (Clontech). Plasmids were transfected into H1299 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 following the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen); HEK293T cells were transfected using calcium phosphate transfection method. PML−/− MEFs cells were transfected using Lipofectamine™ LTX and Plus Reagent following the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). Immunostaining was carried out as described previously (47Tang J. Wu S. Liu H. Stratt R. Barak O.G. Shiekhattar R. Picketts D.J. Yang X. A novel transcription regulatory complex containing death domain-associated protein and the ATR-X syndrome protein.J. Biol.

TRITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were from BeiJingDingGuoChangSheng Biotech. Co. Ltd. All images were taken with a Leica WetzlarGmbH microscope. Data acquisition was done with SPOT camera and software (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc.). The yeast two-hybrid approach we used to analyze protein interaction was described in (48Stehmeier P. Muller S. Phospho-regulated SUMO interaction modules connect the SUMO system to CK2 signaling.Mol. Cell. 2009; 33: 400-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Briefly, the pACT2-PML-CT2 or -CT5 plasmid was co-transformed into AH109 with the pGBKT7 plasmids expressing the C-terminal fragments of PML isoforms and PML-VI according to standard procedures. Empty vectors were served as negative controls. The presence of “bait” and “prey” proteins in co-transformed cells was indicated by growth on double drop-out plates devoid of leucine and tryptophan in the media. The interactions were scored positive if the co-transformed cells were also able to grow on quadruple drop-out plates devoid of leucine, tryptophan, histidine, and adenine. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments were carried out on a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) essentially as described before (40Weidtkamp-Peters S. Lenser T. Negorev D. Gerstner N. Hofmann T.G. Schwanitz G. Hoischen C. Maul G. Dittrich P. Hemmerich P. Dynamics of component exchange at PML nuclear bodies.J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 2731-2743Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). 2–10 images were taken before the bleach pulse, and 50–200 images were acquired after bleaching of regions of interest containing one nuclear body each at 0.05% laser transmission to minimize scan bleaching. Image acquisition frequency was adapted to the recovery rate of the respective GFP fusion protein. The pinhole was adjusted to 1 airy unit. Quantitation of relative fluorescence intensities was done according to Weidtkamp-Peters et al. (40Weidtkamp-Peters S. Lenser T. Negorev D. Gerstner N. Hofmann T.G. Schwanitz G. Hoischen C. Maul G.

Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 2731-2743Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) using Origin software (OriginLab, Northampton, MA). The principles of RICS have been described in detail previously (49Digman M.A. Brown C.M. Sengupta P. Wiseman P.W. Horwitz A.R. Gratton E. Measuring fast dynamics in solutions and cells with a laser scanning microscope.Biophys. J. 2005; 89: 1317-1327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). In RICS, intensity fluctuations between neighboring pixels from confocal images are analyzed by spatially auto-correlating the image in the x and y direction using two-dimensional fast Fourier transformation (49Digman M.A. Brown C.M.

J. 2005; 89: 1317-1327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). For RICS of the GFP fusion constructs in this study, time series of GFP fluorescence images (512 × 512 pixels, pixel dwell time: 6.3 μs) were acquired in a subregion of the nucleus by confocal microscopy using a LSM710, the Plan-Apochromat 63× oil objective, and the RICS software package from Zeiss. Subregions (64 × 64 pixels) within this time series are than extracted, and correlation spectra are assessed from these subregions. Diffusion coefficient maps were generated by fitting with a free diffusion model assuming one component according to the RICS protocols provided by the manufacturer. The cell lysates were made in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl at pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1.0% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm DTT, and 1× complete protease mixture). Protein samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto PVDF membrane. The membrane was blocked in 5% skim milk and probed with the indicated antibodies. Detection was performed using an ECL detection kit (Cwbiotech). To analyze the interaction between the C-terminal domain of PML-II and that of individual PML isoforms as well as PML-VI, F-PML-CT2, individual GFP-nls-CT (1–5), and GFP-PML-VI were expressed separately in HEK293T cells. The cell extracts were prepared using lysis buffer as described previously. The amounts of GFP-tagged proteins in the soluble extracts were adjusted to the similar level by varying the amounts of the plasmids transfected. Fixed volumes of F-PML-CT2 and the control extracts were mixed with the individual GFP-tagged protein containing extracts. The immunoprecipitation was then carried out with anti-FLAG M2 beads for 30 min. The immunoprecipitated complexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-GFP. H1299 cells were transfected with plasmids expressing full-length and C-terminal region of PML-V as well as their respective Arg to Pro mutants. 24 h later the cells were lysed with the above 1% Triton X 100-containing lysis buffer for 20 min on ice. The cell lysates were then centrifuged at 13,800 × g for 20 min. The supernatants were removed and designated as soluble fractions. The pellets were washed 3 times with PBS and then sonicated briefly on ice in the lysis buffer. The resulting samples were considered as insoluble fractions. Both soluble and insoluble fractions were subject to SDS-page and Western blot analysis. To assess the potential contribution of the C-terminal region of PML isoforms I-V to the localization of PML nuclear bodies, we fused them individually to GFP containing a NLS. These fusion proteins were designated as GFP-nls-CTn (n = 1–5) (Fig. 1B). We then examined the subcellular localization of these fusion proteins in H1299 cells. GFP-nls-CT3 and GFP-nls-CT4 localized exclusively in a diffuse pattern throughout the nucleoplasm excluding nucleoli. In contrast, GFP-nls-CT1, GFP-nl"

Liver mitochondria from iPLA(2)γ(-/-) mice were markedly resistant to calcium-induced swelling in the presence or absence of phosphate in comparison with wild-type littermates. Furthermore, the iPLA(2)γ enantioselective inhibitor (R)-(E)-6-(bromomethylene)-3-(1-naphthalenyl)-2H-tetrahydropyran-2-one ((R)-BEL) was markedly more potent than (S)-BEL in inhibiting mPTP opening in mitochondria from wild-type liver in comparison with hepatic mitochondria from iPLA(2)γ(-/-) mice. Intriguingly, low micromolar concentrations of long chain fatty acyl-CoAs and the non-hydrolyzable thioether analog of palmitoyl-CoA markedly accelerated Ca(2+)-induced mPTP opening in liver mitochondria from wild-type mice. The addition of l-carnitine enabled the metabolic channeling of acyl-CoA through carnitine palmitoyltransferases (CPT-1/2) and attenuated the palmitoyl-CoA-mediated amplification of calcium-induced mPTP opening. In contrast, mitochondria from iPLA(2)γ(-/-) mice were insensitive to fatty acyl-CoA-mediated augmentation of calcium-induced mPTP opening. Moreover, mitochondria from iPLA(2)γ(-/-) mouse liver were resistant to Ca(2+)/t-butyl hydroperoxide-induced mPTP opening in comparison with wild-type littermates. In support of these findings, cytochrome c release from iPLA(2)γ(-/-) mitochondria was dramatically decreased in response to calcium in the presence or absence of either t-butyl hydroperoxide or phenylarsine oxide in comparison with wild-type littermates. Collectively, these results identify iPLA(2)γ as an important mechanistic component of the mPTP, define its downstream products as potent regulators of mPTP opening, and demonstrate the integrated roles of mitochondrial bioenergetics and lipidomic flux in modulating mPTP opening promoting the activation of necrotic and necroapoptotic pathways of cell death."

Paradoxically, however, nonsynonymous mutations of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) are frequently found in cancer cells and may have a causal role in the development of resistance to genotoxic stress induced by common chemotherapeutic agents, such as cis-diammine-dichloroplatinum(II) (cisplatin, CDDP). Little is known about how these mutations arise and the associated mechanisms leading to chemoresistance. Here, we show that the development of adaptive chemoresistance in the A549 non-small-cell lung cancer cell line to CDDP is associated with the hetero- to homoplasmic shift of a nonsynonymous mutation in MT-ND2, encoding the mitochondrial Complex-I subunit ND2. The mutation resulted in a 50% reduction of the NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase activity of the complex, which was compensated by increased biogenesis of respiratory chain complexes. The compensatory mitochondrial biogenesis was most likely mediated by the nuclear co-activators peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator-1α (PGC-1α) and PGC-1β, both of which were significantly upregulated in the CDDP-resistant cells. Importantly, both transient and stable silencing of PGC-1β re-established the sensitivity of these cells to CDDP-induced apoptosis. Remarkably, the PGC-1β-mediated CDDP resistance was independent of the mitochondrial effects of the co-activator. Altogether, our results suggest that partial respiratory chain defects because of mtDNA mutations can lead to compensatory upregulation of nuclear transcriptional co-regulators, in turn mediating resistance to genotoxic stress."
https://openalex.org/W2042623144,"Dihydrotestosterone is a more potent androgen than testosterone and plays an important role in endocrine function. We demonstrated that, like testosterone, dihydrotestosterone can be oxidized by human cytochrome P450 (P450) 19A1, the steroid aromatase. The products identified include the 19-hydroxy- and 19-oxo derivatives and the resulting Δ(1,10)-, Δ(5,10)-, and Δ(9,10)-dehydro 19-norsteroid products (loss of 19-methyl group). The overall catalytic efficiency of oxidation was ~10-fold higher than reported for 3α-reduction by 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, the major enzyme known to deactivate dihydrotestosterone. These and other studies demonstrate the flexibility of P450 19A1 in removing the 1- and 2-hydrogens from 19-norsteroids, the 2-hydrogen from estrone, and (in this case) the 1-, 5β-, and 9β-hydrogens of dihydrotestosterone. Incubation of dihydrotestosterone with human liver microsomes and NADPH yielded the 18- and 19-hydroxy products plus the Δ(1,10)-dehydro 19-nor product identified in the P450 19A1 reaction. The 18- and 19-hydroxylation reactions were attributed to P450 3A4, and 18- and 19-hydroxydihydrotestosterone were identified in human plasma and urine samples. The change in the pucker of the A ring caused by reduction of the Δ(4,5) bond is remarkable in shifting the course of hydroxylation from the 6β-, 2β-, 1β-, and 15β-methylene carbons (testosterone) to the axial methyl groups (18, 19) in dihydrotestosterone and demonstrates the sensitivity of P450 3A4, even with its large active site, to small changes in substrate structure."
https://openalex.org/W2045831415,"Fabry disease is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by loss of α-galactosidase function. More than 500 Fabry disease mutants have been identified, the majority of which are structurally destabilized. A therapeutic strategy under development for lysosomal storage diseases consists of using pharmacological chaperones to stabilize the structure of the mutant protein, thereby promoting lysosomal delivery over retrograde degradation. The substrate analog 1-deoxygalactonojirimycin (DGJ) has been shown to restore activity of mutant α-galactosidase and is currently in clinical trial for treatment of Fabry disease. However, only ∼65% of tested mutants respond to treatment in cultured patient fibroblasts, and the structural underpinnings of DGJ response remain poorly explained. Using computational modeling and cell culture experiments, we show that the DGJ response is negatively affected by protein aggregation of α-galactosidase mutants, revealing a qualitative difference between misfolding-associated and aggregation-associated loss of function. A scoring function combining predicted thermodynamic stability and intrinsic aggregation propensity of mutants captures well their aggregation behavior under overexpression in HeLa cells. Interestingly, the same classifier performs well on DGJ response data of patient-derived cultured lymphoblasts, showing that protein aggregation is an important determinant of chemical chaperone efficiency under endogenous expression levels as well. Our observations reinforce the idea that treatment of aggregation-associated loss of function observed for the more severe α-galactosidase mutants could be enhanced by combining pharmacological chaperone treatment with the suppression of mutant aggregation, e.g. via proteostatic regulator compounds that increase cellular chaperone expression."
https://openalex.org/W2003258294,"Accurate translation of mRNA into protein is a fundamental biological process critical for maintaining normal cellular functions. To ensure translational fidelity, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) employ pre-transfer and post-transfer editing activities to hydrolyze misactivated and mischarged amino acids, respectively. Whereas post-transfer editing, which requires either a specialized domain in aaRS or a trans-protein factor, is well described, the mechanism of pre-transfer editing is less understood. Here, we show that yeast mitochondrial threonyl-tRNA synthetase (MST1), which lacks an editing domain, utilizes pre-transfer editing to discriminate against serine. MST1 misactivates serine and edits seryl adenylate (Ser-AMP) in a tRNA-independent manner. MST1 hydrolyzes 80% of misactivated Ser-AMP at a rate 4-fold higher than that for the cognate threonyl adenylate (Thr-AMP) while releasing 20% of Ser-AMP into the solution. To understand the mechanism of pre-transfer editing, we solved the crystal structure of MST1 complexed with an analog of Ser-AMP. The binding of the Ser-AMP analog to MST1 induces conformational changes in the aminoacylation active site, and it positions a potential hydrolytic water molecule more favorably for nucleophilic attack. In addition, inhibition results reveal that the Ser-AMP analog binds the active site 100-fold less tightly than the Thr-AMP analog. In conclusion, we propose that the plasticity of the aminoacylation site in MST1 allows binding of Ser-AMP and the appropriate positioning of the hydrolytic water molecule."

Na(v)s participate in a wide range of electrophysiological processes. Consequently, their malfunctioning has been associated with numerous diseases. The development of subtype-selective modulators of Na(v)s remains highly important in the treatment of such disorders. In current research, a series of novel, synthetic, and bioactive compounds were designed based on two naturally occurring μ-conotoxins that target Na(v)s. The initial designed peptide contains solely 13 amino acids and was therefore named ""Mini peptide."" It was derived from the μ-conotoxins KIIIA and BuIIIC. Based on this Mini peptide, 10 analogues were subsequently developed, comprising 12-16 amino acids with two disulfide bridges. Following appropriate folding and mass verification, blocking effects on Na(v)s were investigated. The most promising compound established an IC(50) of 34.1 ± 0.01 nM (R2-Midi on Na(v)1.2). An NMR structure of one of our most promising compounds was determined. Surprisingly, this structure does not reveal an α-helix. We prove that it is possible to design small peptides based on known pharmacophores of μ-conotoxins without losing their potency and selectivity. These data can provide crucial material for further development of conotoxin-based therapeutics."

In this study, we demonstrate that fatty acids reduce the inactivation of LPL by Angptl4. This was the case both with ccd-Angptl4 and full-length Angptl4, and the effect was seen in human plasma or in the presence of albumin. The effect decreased in the sequence oleic acid > palmitic acid > myristic acid > linoleic acid > linolenic acid. Surface plasmon resonance, isothermal titration calorimetry, fluorescence, and chromatography measurements revealed that fatty acids bind with high affinity to ccd-Angptl4. The interactions were characterized by fast association and slow dissociation rates, indicating formation of stable complexes. The highest affinity for ccd-Angptl4 was detected for oleic acid with a subnanomolar equilibrium dissociation constant (K(d)). The K(d) values for palmitic and myristic acid were in the nanomolar range. Linoleic and linolenic acid bound with much lower affinity. On binding of fatty acids, ccd-Angptl4 underwent conformational changes resulting in a decreased helical content, weakened structural stability, dissociation of oligomers, and altered fluorescence properties of the Trp-38 residue that is located close to the putative LPL-binding region. Based on these results, we propose that fatty acids play an important role in modulating the effects of Angptl4."

Here we report a potential role for the G protein-coupled receptor, calcium-sensing receptor (CSR), in the regulation of Ca2+ reabsorption by salivary gland ducts. Our data show that CSR is present in the apical region of ductal cells where it is co-localized with transient receptor potential canonical 3 (TRPC3). CSR is activated in isolated salivary gland ducts as well as a ductal cell line (SMIE) by altering extracellular [Ca2+] or by aromatic amino acid, l-phenylalanine (l-Phe, endogenous component of saliva), as well as neomycin. CSR activation leads to Ca2+ influx that, in polarized cells grown on a filter support, is initiated in the luminal region. We show that TRPC3 contributes to Ca2+ entry triggered by CSR activation. Further, stimulation of CSR in SMIE cells enhances the CSR-TRPC3 association as well as surface expression of TRPC3. Together our findings suggest that CSR could serve as a Ca2+ sensor in the luminal membrane of salivary gland ducts and regulate reabsorption of [Ca2+] from the saliva via TRPC3, thus contributing to maintenance of salivary [Ca2+].

https://openalex.org/W2087575647,"Singleminded-2s (SIM2s) is a member of the bHLH/PAS family of transcription factors and a key regulator of mammary epithelial cell differentiation. SIM2s is highly expressed in mammary epithelial cells and downregulated in human breast cancer. Loss of Sim2s causes aberrant mouse mammary ductal development, with features suggestive of malignant transformation, whereas overexpression of SIM2s promotes precocious alveolar differentiation in nulliparous mouse mammary glands, suggesting that SIM2s is required for establishing and enhancing mammary gland differentiation. To test the hypothesis that SIM2s regulates tumor cell differentiation, we analyzed SIM2s expression in human primary breast ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) samples and found that SIM2s is lost with progression from DCIS to invasive ductal cancer (IDC). Using a MCF10DCIS.COM progression model, we have shown that SIM2s expression is decreased in MCF10DCIS.COM cells compared with MCF10A cells, and reestablishment of SIM2s in MCF10DCIS.COM cells significantly inhibits growth and invasion both in vitro and in vivo. Analysis of SIM2s-MCF10DCIS.com tumors showed that SIM2s promoted a more differentiated tumor phenotype including the expression of a broad range of luminal markers (CSN2 (β-casein), CDH1 (E-cadherin), and KER18 (keratin-18)) and suppressed genes associated with stem cell maintenance and a basal phenotype (SMO (smoothened), p63, SLUG (snail-2), KER14 (keratin-14) and VIM (vimentin)). Furthermore, loss of SIM2s expression in MCF10DCIS.COM xenografts resulted in a more invasive phenotype and increased lung metastasis likely due to an increase in Hedgehog signaling and matrix metalloproteinase expression. Together, these exciting new data support a role for SIM2s in promoting human breast tumor differentiation and maintaining epithelial integrity."
https://openalex.org/W2061325260,"Erythropoietin (EPO), the cytokine required for erythrocyte production, contributes to muscle progenitor cell proliferation and delay myogenic differentiation. However, the underlying mechanism is not yet fully understood. Here, we report that EPO changes the skeletal myogenic regulatory factor expression program and delays differentiation via induction of GATA-4 and the basic helix-loop-helix TAL1 and that knockdown of both factors promotes differentiation. EPO increases the Sirt1 level, a NAD(+)-dependent deacetylase, and also induces the NAD(+)/NADH ratio that further increases Sirt1 activity. Sirt1 knockdown reduced GATA-4 and TAL1 expression, impaired EPO effect on delayed myogenic differentiation, and the Sirt1 knockdown effect was abrogated when combined with overexpression of GATA-4 or TAL1. GATA-4 interacts with Sirt1 and targets Sirt1 to the myogenin promoter and represses myogenin expression, whereas TAL1 inhibits myogenin expression by decreasing MyoD binding to and activation of the myogenin promoter. Sirt1 was found to bind to the GATA-4 promoter to directly regulate GATA-4 expression and GATA-4 binds to the TAL1 promoter to regulate TAL1 expression positively. These data suggest that GATA-4, TAL1, and Sirt1 cross-talk each other to regulate myogenic differentiation and mediate EPO activity during myogenic differentiation with Sirt1 playing a role upstream of GATA-4 and TAL1. Taken together, our findings reveal a novel role for GATA-4 and TAL1 to affect skeletal myogenic differentiation and EPO response via cross-talk with Sirt1."

Angiotensin-II is a vasoactive peptide implicated in vascular physiology as well as pathophysiology; the pathways connecting angiotensin-II and cytoskeletal remodeling are incompletely understood. Here we show that MARCKS is expressed in intact arterial preparations, with prominent staining of the endothelium. In endothelial cells, angiotensin-II-promoted MARCKS phosphorylation is abrogated by PEG-catalase, implicating endogenous H(2)O(2) in the angiotensin-II response. Studies using the H(2)O(2) biosensor HyPer2 reveal that angiotensin-II promotes increases in intracellular H(2)O(2). We used a Rac1 FRET biosensor to show that angiotensin-II promotes Rac1 activation that is attenuated by PEG-catalase. siRNA-mediated Rac1 knockdown blocks angiotensin-II-stimulated MARCKS phosphorylation. Cell imaging studies using a phosphoinositide 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP(2)) biosensor revealed that angiotensin-II PIP(2) regulation depends on MARCKS and H(2)O(2). siRNA-mediated knockdown of MARCKS or Rac1 attenuates receptor-mediated activation of the tyrosine kinase c-Abl and disrupts actin fiber formation.

Activated GR has been reported to inhibit apoptosis in mammary epithelial cells and breast cancer cells by increasing pro-survival gene expression. In this study, activated GR inhibited p53-dependent apoptosis in MCF10A cells and human mammary epithelial cells that overexpress the MYC oncogene. Specifically, GR agonists hydrocortisone or dexamethasone inhibited p53-dependent apoptosis induced by cisplatin, ionizing radiation, or the MDM2 antagonist Nutlin-3. In contrast, the GR antagonist RU486 sensitized the cells to apoptosis by these agents. Apoptosis inhibition was associated with maintenance of mitochondrial membrane potential, diminished caspase-3 and -7 activation, and increased expression at both the mRNA and protein level of the anti-apoptotic PKC family member PKCε. Knockdown of PKCε via siRNA targeting reversed the protective effect of dexamethasone and restored apoptosis sensitivity. These data provide evidence that activated GR can inhibit p53-dependent apoptosis through induction of the anti-apoptotic factor PKCε."

This pathway is aberrantly activated in several types of tumors; however, a direct role for RelB in the control of cell proliferation is still largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that RelB provides cell proliferation-inhibitory signals in murine fibroblasts. In agreement with these results, RelB ectopic expression inhibits xenograft tumor growth in vivo, whereas RelB knockdown enhances it. Significantly, we show that RelB inhibits cell proliferation and tumor growth in a p53-dependent manner. Mechanistic studies indicate that RelB regulates the transcription of the p53 tumor-suppressor gene through direct recruitment to the p53 promoter, thus increasing both p53 protein levels and expression of p53 target genes such as p21. Our findings define a novel link between NF-κB and growth-inhibitory pathways involving the RelB-dependent transcriptional upregulation of p53. Furthermore, they suggest that inhibition of RelB in some tumor types that retain wild-type p53 may diminish rather than improve therapeutic responses."

The presence of these conserved cysteine residues led us to postulate that EF-G might also be a target during oxidative damage to the translation system in E. coli. In the present study, we examined the effects of ROS on the redox state of cysteine residues and the activity of EF-G of E. coli, using a reconstituted translation system derived from E. coli.

The redox state of the cysteine residues in EF-G was monitored by modifying the thiol groups in EF-G with a maleimidyl reagent, methoxypoly(ethylene glycol)maleimide, which has an average molecular mass of 5 kDa (Nihon Yushi, Tokyo, Japan), and subsequent separation of modified proteins by nonreducing SDS-PAGE on a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel, as described previously (11.Kojima K.

EF-G at 50 μm was incubated with 0.4 mm 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) (Sigma) in buffer that contained 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm EDTA, and 6 m guanidine HCl. Changes in absorbance at 412 nm were monitored, and the number of reactive thiol groups was determined. Translation in vitro was performed with the PURE system, a reconstituted translation system derived from E. coli (12.Shimizu Y. Inoue A. Tomari Y. Suzuki T. Yokogawa T. Nishikawa K. Ueda T. Cell-free translation reconstituted with purified components.Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 751-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (1308) Google Scholar). The translation system was generated, in the absence of EF-G and reducing reagents, by mixing 70 S ribosomes with the individual components that are required for transcription and translation in vitro. After EF-G had been treated with H2O2 in buffer that contained 50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), residual H2O2 was removed by incubating the mixture of EF-G and H2O2 with catalase (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan), as described previously (11.Kojima K. Motohashi K. Morota T. Oshita M. Hisabori T. Hayashi H. Nishiyama Y. Regulation of translation by the redox state of elongation factor G in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803.J. Biol.

The resultant translation system was incubated at 37 °C in the presence of a plasmid DNA that harbored a gene for dihydrofolic acid reductase (DHFR) as template, 35S-labeled cysteine/methionine, and reagents required for translation (12.Shimizu Y. Inoue A. Tomari Y. Suzuki T. Yokogawa T. Nishikawa K. Ueda T. Cell-free translation reconstituted with purified components.Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 751-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (1308) Google Scholar). EF-G that had been treated with 0.5 mm H2O2 or 5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) was subjected to analysis by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry on an Autoflex system (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). External calibration was performed using the peptide calibration standard (Bruker Daltonics), and the m/z value of 2466.74 of a product of autodigested trypsin was used for internal calibration. EF-G at 2 μm was oxidized by incubation with 0.5 mm H2O2 for 5 min at 25 °C. Then 0.75 μm catalase was added to remove residual H2O2, and the oxidized EF-G was incubated for 15 min at 25 °C with DTT at various concentrations in the presence of 4 μm thioredoxin A or 4 μm glutaredoxin A. Proteins were then precipitated with 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and subjected to the thiol modification assay for detection of thiol groups on cysteine residues. The GTPase activity of EF-G was measured by monitoring the release of inorganic phosphate from GTP by the end-point assay with malachite green (13.Starosta A.L. Qin H. Mikolajka A. Leung G.Y. Schwinghammer K. Nicolaou K.C. Chen D.Y. Cooperman B.S. Wilson D.N. Identification of distinct thiopeptide-antibiotic precursor lead compounds using translation machinery assays.Chem.

The reaction mixture contained 30 nm 70 S ribosomes of E. coli, 20 μm GTP, and 60 nm wild-type EF-G or its mutant derivative, plus either 0.5 mm H2O2 or 5 mm DTT. Changes in absorbance at 650 nm were measured spectroscopically. EF-G (6 μm) that had been treated with 0.5 mm H2O2 or 5 mm DTT was incubated at 37 °C for 5 min in the presence of 0.1 μm [α-32P]GTP (3 MBq ml−1, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in blotting buffer that contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 200 μg ml−1 of bovine serum albumin, 10% (w/v) glycerol, and 10 μm GTP. An aliquot of 10 μl was blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (GE Healthcare) and the membrane was washed with 2 ml of blotting buffer that did not contain GTP. The radioactivity from the membrane was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting, as described previously (10.Kojima K. Oshita M. Nanjo Y. Kasai K. Tozawa Y. Hayashi H. Nishiyama Y. Oxidation of elongation factor G inhibits the synthesis of the D1 protein of photosystem II.Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 65: 936-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). We examined the effects of oxidants on the translational activity of EF-G using the PURE system, a translation system in vitro derived from E. coli that was generated by mixing the individual components required for translation (12.Shimizu Y. Inoue A. Tomari Y. Suzuki T. Yokogawa T. Nishikawa K. Ueda T. Cell-free translation reconstituted with purified components.Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 751-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (1308) Google Scholar). Addition of the reduced form of EF-G to a translation system that had been generated without EF-G resulted in the synthesis of DHFR (Fig. 1A). However, when EF-G had been treated with H2O2 for 5 min prior to its addition to the translation system, the synthesis of DHFR was suppressed (Fig. 1A). The extent of suppression depended on the concentration of H2O2 and, at 0.5 mm H2O2, the synthesis of DHFR was completely inhibited (Fig. 1B). These observations suggested that the translational activity of EF-G had been abolished by H2O2. We monitored the redox state of three cysteine residues of EF-G by modifying free thiol groups with a maleimidyl reagent (average molecular mass, 5 kDa) under the same oxidizing conditions. Modification of the fully reduced form of EF-G with this reagent resulted in a decrease in the electrophoretic mobility of EF-G on a nonreducing gel (Fig. 1C). Incubation of EF-G with H2O2 at various concentrations, prior to the modification, decreased the change in mobility, indicating that some fraction of the three cysteine residues had been oxidized by H2O2 and had failed to bind the maleimidyl reagent (Fig. 1C). The extent of oxidation of EF-G depended on the concentration of H2O2 and, at 0.5 mm H2O2, EF-G was fully oxidized (Fig. 1D). No oligomers of EF-G were detected after oxidation of EF-G with H2O2, suggesting that EF-G might be unable to form intermolecular disulfide bonds. The similarity in terms of dependence on the concentration of H2O2 between the translational activity of EF-G and the redox state of its cysteine residues suggested that the inactivation of EF-G might have been due to the oxidation of specific cysteine residues. We also determined that not only H2O2 but also other oxidants, such as copper(II) chloride and AldrithiolTM-4, inhibited the translational activity of EF-G and oxidized specific cysteine residues (supplemental Fig. S1). Thus, it appeared that EF-G might be oxidized to yield an identical product under a variety of oxidizing conditions. The circular dichroism spectra revealed that the oxidation of EF-G with 0.5 mm H2O2 did not affect the secondary structure of EF-G (supplemental Fig. S2 and supplemental Experimental Procedures). To determine the number of oxidized cysteine residues in EF-G, we compared the number of free thiol groups on cysteine residues in EF-G and mutant derivatives, in which specific cysteine residues had been replaced by serine, by monitoring changes in absorption after reaction of thiol groups with DTNB. The number of free thiol groups per molecule of reduced EF-G was 3.0, which corresponds to the number of cysteine residues in EF-G, whereas those of oxidized EF-G, single-mutated C114S, double-mutated C114S/C266S, and triple-mutated C114S/C266S/C398S EF-G were 1.2, 2.2, 1.3, and 0.51, respectively (Fig. 2A). These results suggested that two cysteine residues of EF-G had been oxidized by H2O2 to generate an intramolecular disulfide bond. To identify the cysteine residues that were oxidized by H2O2, we examined the effects of oxidation on the redox state of cysteine residues of mutated EF-G by the thiol-modification assay. In the presence of 0.5 mm H2O2, the cysteine residues in the C266S and C398S mutant proteins were oxidized in a similar manner to those in wild-type EF-G, whereas those in the C114S mutant protein were no longer oxidized (Fig. 2B). We concluded, therefore, that Cys114 might be a target of oxidation by H2O2. However, we failed to identify the counterpart of Cys114 for the formation of a disulfide bond by this method. It is possible that Cys114 is extremely reactive and can readily react with another cysteine residue to form an abnormal disulfide bond in the absence of its true counterpart. As a consequence, both the single-mutated proteins, namely, C266S and C398S appeared to be susceptible to oxidation by H2O2. The double-mutated C266S/C398S protein, in which Cys114 is the sole remaining cysteine residue, was not oxidized by H2O2 (Fig. 2B). Apparently, Cys114 cannot be oxidized in the absence of other cysteine residues, and other types of oxidation of Cys114, such as the formation of sulfenic acid, might not occur under oxidizing conditions. To identify the counterpart of Cys114 for formation of a disulfide bond, we performed peptide-mapping analysis of EF-G. We digested the reduced and oxidized forms of EF-G, which had been obtained by incubation of EF-G with 5 mm DTT and 0.5 mm H2O2, respectively, with trypsin and measured the mass of the resulting peptide fragments by mass spectrometry. In the analysis of the reduced form of EF-G, peptide fragments that included Cys114, Cys266, and Cys398 were detected (supplemental Fig. S3 and Table 1). By contrast, in the analysis of the oxidized form of EF-G, levels of these peptide fragments were considerably lower and a peptide fragment with a mass of 4282.49 was newly detected. The mass of the new peptide corresponded to that of a peptide fragment that resulted from the combination of two peptides, one including Cys114 and one including Cys266, via formation of a disulfide bond (supplemental Fig. S3 and Table 1). These observations support the hypothesis that Cys114 and Cys266 might form an intramolecular disulfide bond under oxidizing conditions. In the oxidized form of EF-G, we did not detect the peptide including Cys114 that was oxidized to sulfenic acid under the conditions that we tested.TABLE 1Theoretical and observed monoisotopic mass values for peptide fragments that included cysteine residuesPeak 1 (Cys266)Peak 2 (Cys398)Peak 3 (Cys114)Peak 4 (Cys114-Cys266)Expected1721.04ΔaΔ, difference between given value and expected value.2044.26Δ2564.96Δ4283.01ΔReducing1721.58+0.542045.34+0.082565.20+0.06NDbND, not detected.Oxidizing1721.45+0.412045.31+0.052565.12+0.164282.49−0.52a Δ, difference between given value and expected value.b ND, not detected. Open table in a new tab To clarify the relationship between the redox state of individual cysteine residues and translational activity, we investigated the activities of our mutant derivatives of EF-G in the translation system prepared without EF-G. Treatment of neither the C266S nor the C398S mutant protein with 0.5 mm H2O2 resulted in the synthesis of detectable DHFR, whereas the C114S mutant protein that had been treated with 0.5 mm H2O2 was able to support translation at the same rate as its reduced form (Fig. 3), indicating that Cys114 is both a target of oxidation by H2O2 and a site of regulation of the activity of EF-G. The double-mutated C266S/C398 protein, with an intact Cys114 residue, was also insensitive to oxidation by H2O2 (Fig. 3), suggesting that EF-G cannot be inactivated unless Cys114 forms a disulfide bond with another cysteine residue. Given the results of our analysis of the redox state of cysteine residues, we concluded from these observations that EF-G might be active in its reduced form and inactive in its oxidized form. The redox behavior of EF-G that depended on its cysteine residues suggested that EF-G might interact with thioredoxin or glutaredoxin, two ubiquitous proteins that regulate the activity of target proteins by reducing disulfide bonds (14.Hisabori T. Nishiyama Y. Jacquot J.-P. Advances in Botanical Research. Vol. 52. Academic Press, Burlington, VT2009: 187-205Google Scholar, 15.Hisabori T. Motohashi K. Hosoya-Matsuda N. Ueoka-Nakanishi H. Romano P.G. Towards a functional dissection of thioredoxin networks in plant cells.Photochem. Photobiol. 2007; 83: 145-151PubMed Google Scholar). We examined whether these redox proteins might be able to reduce the disulfide bond in oxidized EF-G. The results of a thiol modification assay showed that the oxidized cysteine residues in EF-G (2 μm) that had been incubated with 0.5 mm H2O2 were partially reduced by subsequent exposure to a relatively high concentration of DTT, such as 5 mm (Fig. 4A). By contrast, complete reduction of EF-G was achieved by the addition of 4 μm thioredoxin A, even in the presence of only 50 μm DTT. Thus, thioredoxin was able to interact with EF-G and to reduce an intramolecular disulfide bond. However, when we tested glutaredoxin A in a similar manner, we failed to reduce the oxidized EF-G (Fig. 4A). We next examined whether the reduction of EF-G by thioredoxin might affect the activity of EF-G in translation. We incubated 2 μm oxidized EF-G with 4 μm thioredoxin A and 50 μm DTT, namely, under the conditions used for the thioredoxin-assisted reduction of EF-G. When we added the reduced EF-G to the translation system in vitro, translational activity was restored (Fig. 4B). By contrast, after incubation of 2 μm oxidized EF-G with 50 μm DTT alone or with 4 μm glutaredoxin A alone, no translation was observed. In these experiments, low concentrations of DTT, thioredoxin, or glutaredoxin were added to the translation system concomitantly with EF-G. Control assays indicated that the addition of these components at such low concentrations to the translation system with EF-G did not affect translational activity (Fig. 4C). Thus, it was evident that oxidized EF-G could be reactivated by thioredoxin. Vacant 70 S ribosomes are known to stimulate the GTPase activity of EF-G via formation of a 70S·EF-G·GTP complex (16.Ramakrishnan V. Ribosome structure and the mechanism of translation.Cell. 2002; 108: 557-572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). We investigated whether the redox state of EF-G might affect this GTPase activity. We incubated EF-G with 5 mm DTT or 0.5 mm H2O2 and then measured the GTPase activity by monitoring the formation of a malachite green complex. When we added reduced EF-G to 70 S ribosomes in the presence of GTP, we observed the hydrolysis of GTP (Fig. 5A). By contrast, the addition of oxidized EF-G resulted in 60% less hydrolysis of GTP. Furthermore, the C114S mutant protein that had been treated with 0.5 mm H2O2 was able to support the hydrolysis of GTP at the same rate as the reduced EF-G (Fig. 5A). Thus, the inactivation of EF-G by oxidation might be due, in part, to the suppression of its GTPase activity as a consequence of the formation of an intramolecular disulfide bond. However, the GTP-binding ability of EF-G was hardly affected by oxidation with 0.5 mm H2O2 (Fig. 5B). We examined the effect of replacement of Cys114 by serine on the sensitivity of the entire translation system to oxidation by H2O2. The translation system that had been generated with the C114S mutant protein, instead of wild-type EF-G, was able to synthesize DHFR in the presence of 100 μm H2O2, whereas the translation system with wild-type EF-G was completely inactive in the presence of 50 μm H2O2 (Fig. 6). Note that EF-G was diluted 20-fold when it was added to the translation system. The apparent sensitivity of the translation system to H2O2, as compared with the sensitivity of EF-G shown in Fig. 1, was due to the low molecular ratio of EF-G to H2O2. Thus, replacement of a single specific cysteine residue, Cys114, of EF-G by serine rendered the entire translation system of E. coli more resistant to oxidation. In other words, EF-G is likely to be a critical target of oxidation within the translation system of E. coli. In the present study, we demonstrated that the inactivation of EF-G of E. coli by H2O2 was due to oxidation of two specific cysteine residues, namely, Cys114 and Cys266, and the subsequent formation of an intramolecular disulfide bond. The carbonylation of amino acid residues, which was previously proposed as the mechanism of oxidative damage to EF-G (3.Tamarit J. Cabiscol E. Ros J. Identification of the major oxidatively damaged proteins in Escherichia coli cells exposed to oxidative stress.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3027-3032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), occurs under much more severely oxidizing conditions. Of the two redox-active cysteine residues, Cys114 was much more sensitive than Cys266 to H2O2. When Cys114 remained active in the absence of Cys266, Cys114 was able to react with Cys398 to form an abnormal disulfide bond under oxidizing conditions, yielding an inactive EF-G. Therefore, both the C266S and C398S mutant proteins were susceptible to oxidation by H2O2 (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3). By contrast, Cys266 was able only to react with Cys114. The different redox properties of the cysteine residues might explain why only the absence of Cys114 rendered EF-G insensitive to oxidation by H2O2. A similar hierarchy of reactivity of redox-active cysteine residues was observed in EF-G of Synechocystis (11.Kojima K. Motohashi K. Morota T. Oshita M. Hisabori T. Hayashi H. Nishiyama Y. Regulation of translation by the redox state of elongation factor G in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 18685-18691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and also in PhoA, an alkaline phosphatase of E. coli (17.Kadokura H. Beckwith J. Detecting folding intermediates of a protein as it passes through the bacterial translocation channel.Cell. 2009; 138: 1164-1173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The insensitivity to oxidation of the double-mutated EF-G, C226S/C398S, in which Cys114 was present and the other cysteine residues had been replaced by serine suggests that Cys114 might not undergo some other types of oxidation, such as the formation of sulfenic acid, under the oxidizing conditions that we tested. In addition, the reduction of oxidized EF-G by thioredoxin suggests that Cys114 might not be oxidized to form sulfinic acid, which requires a specific enzyme, such as sulfiredoxin, and ATP for reduction (18.Roussel X. Béchade G. Kriznik A. Van Dorsselaer A. Sanglier-Cianferani S. Branlant G. Rahuel-Clermont S. Evidence for the formation of a covalent thiosulfinate intermediate with peroxiredoxin in the catalytic mechanism of sulfiredoxin.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 22371-22382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, in the crystal structure of EF-G of E. coli, which is bound to the ribosome-recycling factor (19.Yokoyama T. Shaikh T.R. Iwakura N. Kaji H. Kaji A. Agrawal R.K. Structural insights into initial and intermediate steps of the ribosome-recycling process.EMBO J. 2012; 31: 1836-1846Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), it appears that Cys266 is not located in the close vicinity of Cys114, whereas Cys398 is apart from Cys114 (supplemental Fig. S4). Thus, the distances between cysteine residues in the crystal structure cannot fully explain the formation of disulfide bonds, although these distances might have been changed by some conformational change in EF-G after the binding of the ribosome-recycling factor. From our biochemical evidence, we propose that the formation of disulfide bond is most likely, but we cannot thoroughly exclude the possibility that cysteine residues undergo some other types of oxidation, including the formation of sulfenic acid. Crystallographic studies of the reduced and oxidized forms of EF-G will be necessary for a full understanding of the mechanism of the oxidation of cysteine residues. EF-G translocates peptidyl-tRNA from the A site to the P site in the ribosome, upon a conformational change that is driven by the hydrolysis of GTP. Treatment of EF-G with H2O2 resulted in a decrease in the GTPase activity of EF-G, whereas replacement of Cys114 by serine rendered the GTPase activity insensitive to H2O2 (Fig. 5). The GTP-binding ability of EF-G and its global structure were hardly affected by oxidation by H2O2 (Figs. 5 and supplemental Fig. S2). These observations suggest that the formation of the intramolecular disulfide bond might inhibit the GTPase activity of EF-G via interference with an appropriate conformational change in EF-G that is induced after EF-G binds to the ribosome. However, 40% of the GTPase activity of EF-G remained when the translational activity of EF-G had been completely abolished in the presence of 0.5 mm H2O2. This apparent discrepancy suggests that the formation of an intramolecular disulfide bond might also inhibit a conformational change in EF-G after the hydrolysis of GTP. Fusidic acid, an antibiotic specific to EF-G, inhibits the conformational change in EF-G that facilitates the dissociation of EF-G from the ribosome, without affecting the hydrolysis of GTP (20.Inoue-Yokosawa N.

Some metabolic processes in a variety of organisms are known to be controlled by regulatory systems that involve redox reactions. A fundamental example of such a redox reaction is the reversible reduction of disulfide bonds between cysteine residues by thioredoxin or glutaredoxin (14.Hisabori T. Nishiyama Y. Jacquot J.-P. Advances in Botanical Research. Vol. 52. Academic Press, Burlington, VT2009: 187-205Google Scholar, 15.Hisabori T. Motohashi K. Hosoya-Matsuda N. Ueoka-Nakanishi H. Romano P.G.

Thioredoxins and glutaredoxins. Unifying elements in redox biology.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2009; 43: 335-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Assays of thiol modification and translation in vitro revealed that the disulfide bond in peroxide-oxidized EF-G was reduced by thioredoxin but not glutaredoxin and that the newly reduced form of EF-G was able to function in translation (Fig. 4). It has also been reported that EF-G was one of a number of proteins from E. coli that bound to a thioredoxin-affinity column (23.Kumar J.K. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proteomic analysis of thioredoxin-targeted proteins in Escherichia coli.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 3759-3764Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The activation of EF-G by thioredoxin suggests that EF-G might be involved in the redox regulation of cellular metabolism in E. coli. In E. coli, thiol-dependent redox systems in the cytoplasm include thioredoxin- and glutaredoxin-dependent pathways that correspond to the flows of electrons that reflect gradients in redox potentials. The main source of electrons for these reducing pathways is the oxidation of hexose phosphates in the pentose phosphate pathway, which regenerates NADPH from NADP+ (22.Meyer Y. Buchanan B.B.

Differential functions in oxidative stress, iron metabolism, and DNA synthesis.FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 3598-3607Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The reducing power of NADPH is used for the reduction of thioredoxin by thioredoxin reductase. If these reducing pathways are suppressed, cellular homeostasis is greatly perturbed. For example, deletion of the gene for thioredoxin reductase significantly suppresses the growth of E. coli under oxidative stress (25.Vlamis-Gardikas A. Potamitou A. Zarivach R. Hochman A. Holmgren A. Characterization of Escherichia coli null mutants for glutaredoxin 2.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10861-10868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 26.Derman A.I. Prinz W.A. Belin D. Beckwith J. Mutations that allow disulfide bond formation in the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli.Science. 1993; 262: 1744-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). The activation of EF-G by the reduced form of thioredoxin suggests that the translational machinery might be regulated, via EF-G, by the reducing power that is generated by the pentose phosphate pathway and mediated by thioredoxin in E. coli. Under oxidative conditions, for example, when the supply of reducing power is limited and the production of ROS from respiration is stimulated, the specific pair of cysteine residues in EF-G might be oxidized. As a consequence, both protein synthesis and those aspects of cell metabolism that are supported by protein synthesis would be suppressed. In the photosynthetic organism Synechocystis, the reducing power that results from the photosynthetic transport of electrons is transmitted to EF-G via thioredoxin and activates the synthesis of proteins de novo, which enhances the repair of PSII. However, under strong light, which induces oxidative stress, the oxidation of EF-G by ROS competes with its reduction, suppressing protein synthesis (7.Nishiyama Y. Allakhverdiev S.I. Murata N.

Thus, the ROS-sensitive cysteine residues in EF-G might play a key role in the regulation of protein synthesis, via either activation or suppression, in both Synechocystis and E. coli. The locations of cysteine residues are strongly conserved in the EF-G proteins of various prokaryotes, in the chloroplast EF-G proteins of some plants, and in the mitochondrial EF-G proteins of some mammals, such as human and Drosophila (supplemental Fig. S5). The conserved cysteine residues in EF-G might play an evolutionarily conserved and important role in the regulation of the translational machinery. Most translation systems in vitro are susceptible to oxidation, and the appropriate synthesis of proteins under oxidizing conditions is technically difficult.

The human Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase SOD1 was not synthesized successfully in the translation system of E. coli, mainly because of the absence of the appropriate formation of disulfide bonds (31.Ezure T. Suzuki T. Ando E. Nishimura O. Tsunasawa S.

The synthesis of active SOD1 has been achieved with an insect translation system from Spodoptera frugiperda 21, which does not require reducing reagents (31.Ezure T. Suzuki T. Ando E. Nishimura O.

Replacement of Cys114 by serine in EF-G altered the sensitivity of the entire translation system of E. coli to H2O2 in vitro, and the modified translation system was capable of operating under moderately oxidizing conditions. Appropriate alteration of EF-G in the translational system of E. coli should allow the synthesis of active proteins with the formation of the necessary disulfide bonds.

https://openalex.org/W2060794653,"Differentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) into osteoblast-like cells is considered to be a mechanism of vascular calcification. However, regulators of osteoblast-like differentiation of vascular SMCs are not fully elucidated. Here, we investigated the expression of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-binding endothelial cell precursor-derived regulator (BMPER), a vertebrate homologue of Drosophila crossveinless-2, in vascular SMCs and the role and mode of action of BMPER in osteoblast-like differentiation of human coronary artery SMCs (HCASMCs). BMPER was expressed in cultured human vascular SMCs, including HCASMCs. Silencing of endogenous BMPER expression by an RNA interference technique inhibited osteoblast-like differentiation of HCASMCs, as evaluated by up-regulation of osteoblast markers such as alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), by down-regulation of a SMC marker α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA), and by mineralization. Treatment with recombinant BMPER enhanced, whereas BMP-2 reduced osteoblast-like differentiation. BMPER antagonized BMP-2-induced phosphorylation of Smad 1/5/8, suggesting that the effect of BMPER was mediated by antagonizing the action of BMP. BMPER increased IκBα phosphorylation and NF-κB activity and specific NF-κB decoy oligonucleotides deteriorated osteoblast-like differentiation of HCASMCs by BMPER. In human coronary artery with atherosclerotic plaque containing calcification, the BMPER-positive signals were observed in the neointimal and medial SMCs in the vicinity of the plaque. These findings indicate that BMPER is a novel regulator of the osteoblast-like differentiation of HCASMCs."
https://openalex.org/W2004717614,"Pokeweed antiviral protein (PAP) from Phytolacca americana is a ribosome-inactivating protein (RIP) and an RNA N-glycosidase that removes specific purine residues from the sarcin/ricin loop of large rRNA, arresting protein synthesis at the translocation step. PAP is also a cap-binding protein and is a potent antiviral agent against many plant, animal, and human viruses. To elucidate the mechanism of RNA depurination, and to understand how PAP recognizes and targets various RNAs, the interactions between PAP and turnip mosaic virus genome-linked protein (VPg) were investigated. VPg can function as a cap analog in cap-independent translation and potentially target PAP to uncapped IRES-containing RNA. In this work, fluorescence spectroscopy and HPLC techniques were used to quantitatively describe PAP depurination activity and PAP-VPg interactions. PAP binds to VPg with high affinity (29.5 nm); the reaction is enthalpically driven and entropically favored. Further, VPg is a potent inhibitor of PAP depurination of RNA in wheat germ lysate and competes with structured RNA derived from tobacco etch virus for PAP binding. VPg may confer an evolutionary advantage by suppressing one of the plant defense mechanisms and also suggests the possible use of this protein against the cytotoxic activity of ribosome-inactivating proteins.

PAP inhibits the in vitro translation of brome mosaic virus and potato virus X RNAs without ribosomal depurination (19Hudak K.A. Wang P. Tumer N.E. A novel mechanism for inhibition of translation by pokeweed antiviral protein. Depurination of the capped RNA template.RNA. 2000; 6: 369-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) by binding to the cap structure and depurinating the RNA. This may be the primary mechanism for PAP antiviral activity (20Hudak K.A. Bauman J.D. Tumer N.E. Pokeweed antiviral protein binds to the cap structure of eukaryotic mRNA and depurinates the mRNA downstream of the cap.RNA. 2002; 8: 1148-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar); however, it does not clarify the inhibitory effects of PAP on the replication of uncapped viruses, such as influenza (17Tomlinson J.A. Walker V.M. Flewett T.H. Barclay G.R. The inhibition of infection by cucumber mosaic virus and influenza virus by extracts from Phytolacca americana.J. Gen.

Acad. Sci. 1977; 284: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Further, PAP does not depurinate every capped RNA, and it can inhibit translation of uncapped viral RNAs in vitro without causing detectable depurination at multiple sites (21Vivanco J.M. Tumer N.E. Translation inhibition of capped and uncapped viral RNAs mediated by ribosome-inactivating proteins.Phytopathology. 2003; 93: 588-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Thus, recognition of the cap structure alone is not sufficient for depurination of RNA (21Vivanco J.M. Tumer N.E. Translation inhibition of capped and uncapped viral RNAs mediated by ribosome-inactivating proteins.Phytopathology. 2003; 93: 588-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In the presence of wheat germ lysate, PAP depurinates uncapped barley yellow dwarf virus transcripts containing a functional WT 3′-translation enhancer sequence but does not depurinate messages containing a non-functional mutant 3′-translation enhancer sequence (22Wang M. Hudak K.A. A novel interaction of pokeweed antiviral protein with translation initiation factors 4G and iso4G. A potential indirect mechanism to access viral RNAs.Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 1174-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This suggests that PAP binding to eIF4G/iso4G provides a mechanism for PAP to access both uncapped and capped viral RNAs for depurination. PAP binds to the eIFiso4G, and the presence of cap analog increases these protein-protein interactions (23Baldwin A.E. Khan M.A. Tumer N.E. Goss D.J. Friedland D.E. Characterization of pokeweed antiviral protein binding to mRNA cap analogs. Competition with nucleotides and enhancement by translation initiation factor iso4G.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1789: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), suggesting that PAP binds to the 5′-m7G cap of mRNA. To understand how PAP recognizes and selectively targets RNAs, interactions between PAP and TuMV genome-linked protein (VPg) were investigated. VPg is a 22-kDa potyviral protein, covalently attached via a Tyr residue (24Murphy J.F. Rychlik W. Rhoads R.E. Hunt A.G. Shaw J.G. A tyrosine residue in the small nuclear inclusion protein of tobacco vein mottling virus links the VPg to the viral RNA.J. Virol. 1991; 65: 511-513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to the genomes of one-quarter of the plant positive strand RNA viruses, including the Potyviridae genus. VPg plays a pivotal role in the viral infection cycle, replication, and cell-to-cell movement and also has been implicated in overcoming viral resistance in plants (25Keller K.E. Johansen I.E. Martin R.R. Hampton R.O. Potyvirus genome-linked protein (VPg) determines pea seed-borne mosaic virus pathotype-specific virulence in Pisum sativum.Mol. Plant Microbe Interact. 1998; 11: 124-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Interactions between VPg of TuMV and the eIFiso4E/iso4F of Arabidopsis thaliana (26Léonard S. Plante D. Wittmann S. Daigneault N. Fortin M.G. Laliberté J.F. Complex formation between potyvirus VPg and translation eukaryotic initiation factor 4E correlates with virus infectivity.J.

Brierley I. Brown T.D. Identification of a protein linked to the genomic and subgenomic mRNAs of feline calicivirus and its role in translation.J. Gen. Virol. 1997; 78: 1033-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Interactions between VPg and plant eIFiso4E and effects of eIFiso4G on these interactions have been characterized (29Miyoshi H.

Chem. 2006; 281: 28002-28010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). VPg stimulates the in vitro translation of uncapped IRES-containing RNA by targeting eIF4F to the IRES and inhibits capped RNA translation in wheat germ extracts (32Khan M.A. Miyoshi H. Gallie D.R. Goss D.J. Potyvirus genome-linked protein, VPg, directly affects wheat germ in vitro translation. Interactions with translation initiation factors eIF4F and eIFiso4F.J. Biol.

In this study, fluorescence spectroscopy and HPLC techniques were used to quantitatively describe PAP-VPg interactions. PAP interacts strongly with VPg in a mixed type competition for m7GTP cap analog. PAP binds to and depurinates an S/R oligonucleotide, capped and uncapped tobacco etch virus (TEV), and luciferase mRNA, supporting previous conclusions that the cap structure is not the only determinant within the RNA for depurination by PAP. PAP binds to VPg at a different site from the eIFiso4F/eIF4F binding site. The effect of VPg on the depurination of selected RNA molecules, including structured RNA derived from TEV (33Zeenko V.

Cap-independent translation of plant viral RNAs.Virus Res. 2006; 119: 63-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), showed that VPg decreases depurination of RNAs and competes with IRES containing TEV RNA for PAP binding. These findings correlate with the inhibition of PAP enzymatic activity by VPg in wheat germ lysate. Depurination inhibition by VPg may confer an advantage for viral replication, and may be a novel mechanism to overcome plant defenses. All chemicals used (unless otherwise noted) were of molecular biology grade. Tris-HCl, HEPES, KCl, dithiothreitol (DTT), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), aprotinin, soybean trypsin inhibitor, diethylpyrocarbonate, EDTA, and the m7GTP analog were purchased from Sigma. Polyvinylpyrrolidone was purchased from Spectrum. Promega RiboMAXTM large scale RNA production system T7 and SP6 were used for in vitro RNA and S/R oligonucleotide synthesis. Peptone, yeast extract, and NaCl were purchased from Fisher. The SalI and NcoI restriction endonucleases were purchased from New England Biolabs. HiTrap FF chromatography columns (Mono Q and SP) were from GE Healthcare. Plasmid isolation kits and nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow column were purchased from Qiagen. PAP used for these experiments was isolated from the spring leaves of the pokeweed plant (Phytolacca americana) as described previously (23Baldwin A.E. Khan M.A. Tumer N.E. Goss D.J. Friedland D.E.

Acta. 2009; 1789: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). PAP was purified using the ÄKTApurifier system from GE Healthcare, equipped with pump P-900, monitor UV-900, monitor UPC-900, valve INV-907, and mixer M-925. The protein fractions were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE for purity, and the protein concentration was determined using a Pierce Coomassie assay with BSA as the standard. Purification of TuMV VPg was described previously (29Miyoshi H. Suehiro N. Tomoo K. Muto S. Takahashi T. Tsukamoto T. Ohmori T. Natsuaki T. Binding analyses for the interaction between plant virus genome-linked protein (VPg) and plant translational initiation factors.Biochimie. 2006; 88: 329-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). VPg was purified with the ÄKTApurifier system. Purification of VPg-71-His6 and VPg-220-His6 truncated proteins followed an analogous procedure. The purity of all of the proteins was confirmed by 12% SDS-PAGE, and the protein concentration was determined using the Pierce Coomassie assay with BSA as the standard. Prior to spectroscopic measurements, all samples were dialyzed against buffer E (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 1.0 mm DTT, 1.0 mm EDTA), passed through a 0.22-μm Millipore filter, and concentrated with a Centricon 10 concentrator (Amicon Co.) as necessary. The cap binding and scaffolding initiation factors (eIFiso4G and eIFiso4E) were expressed in Escherichia coli containing the constructed pET-3d vector in BL21(DE3)pLysS cells, as described previously (31Khan M.A. Miyoshi H. Ray S. Natsuaki T. Suehiro N. Goss D.J. Interaction of genome-linked protein (VPg) of turnip mosaic virus with wheat germ translation initiation factors eIFiso4E and eIFiso4F.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28002-28010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). All samples were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE and showed homogeneously pure proteins. All protein purification steps were carried out in a cold room at 4 °C. TEV DNA constructs were kindly provided by Daniel R. Gallie (University of California, Riverside, CA). The full-length TEV construct was cloned as described previously (33Zeenko V. Gallie D.R. Cap-independent translation of tobacco etch virus is conferred by an RNA pseudoknot in the 5′-leader.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26813-26824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The TEV1–143 leader sequence was positioned next to the SP6 promoter of the PTL7SN.3 GUS vector. DNA was linearized with NcoI. The linearized DNA was treated with proteinase K (100 μg/ml) and 0.5% SDS in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm CaCl2 for 30 min at 37 °C. DNA was further purified by extraction with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) at pH 8.0 followed by ethanol precipitation. Purity of the resulted DNA was checked on a 1% agarose gel, and the concentration was quantified spectrophotometrically and brought to 0.5 mg/ml. In vitro transcription of the TEV DNA used Promega RiboMAXTM large scale RNA production system SP6 following the manufacturer's protocol. Cap analog, m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G, was incorporated into the TEV transcript during the RiboMAXTM transcription reaction. The ratio of cap analog/GTP was 5:1 to increase the efficiency of the transcription reaction. Capped and uncapped transcripts were analyzed on 20% denaturing polyacrylamide, 8 m urea gels, and the synthesized products were visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Under the conditions of transcription, more than 75% of RNA transcripts were capped, as determined by the fluorescence intensity of ethidium bromide. Capped RNA transcripts were sliced from the gels, redissolved in a buffer solution, precipitated with ethanol, and repurified. The concentration of TEV RNA was determined by measuring the optical density at 260 nm, and the purity of the synthesized RNA was confirmed by measuring the absorbance ratio A260/A280 in diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water. The S/R oligonucleotide dsDNA template (5′-GGATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGTGAACTTAGTACGAGAGGAACAGTTCA-3′; 53 nucleotides) was purchased from Gene LinkTM with the sequence corresponding to the universally conserved S/R loop of the large rRNA. The linear DNA template was treated with proteinase K and purified by phenol/chloroform extraction as for TEV DNA. In vitro synthesis of the S/R oligonucleotide RNA used Promega RiboMAXTM large scale RNA production system T7 following the manufacturer's protocol. Cap analog, m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G, was incorporated into the RNA transcripts during the RiboMAXTM transcription reaction. The plasmid pLUC0 (36Gallie D.R. Feder J.N. Schimke R.T. Walbot V.

Genet. 1991; 228: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) containing the luciferase gene was linearized with DraI and used as template for synthesis of the in vitro transcript. pLUC0 contains a linker sequence (GGCCTAAGCTTGTCGACC) between the T7 promoter and the ATG of luciferase. Following the TAA stop codon of luciferase is a poly(A) tail of 50 A nucleotides immediately upstream of the DraI site. Both capped and uncapped luciferase RNAs were synthesized as run-off transcripts of a T7 polymerase reaction (Promega), as described previously (20Hudak K.A. Bauman J.D. Tumer N.E. Pokeweed antiviral protein binds to the cap structure of eukaryotic mRNA and depurinates the mRNA downstream of the cap.RNA. 2002; 8: 1148-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed by incubating RNA (10 nmol/ml) in Depurination Buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NH4Cl, 7 mm magnesium acetate, and 1 mm DTT) for 15 min at 37 °C in the absence and presence of PAP and VPg in 100-μl reaction volumes. At the end of the incubations, 1 volume of cold ethanol was added, and after 10 min at −80 °C, the ethanol-soluble fractions were recovered by centrifugation for 15 min at 14,000 rpm. Free adenine present in the ethanol-soluble fractions was converted into its etheno derivative (37Zamboni M. Brigotti M. Rambelli F. Montanaro L. Sperti S.

The samples were heated in a water bath at 80 °C for 40 min, extracted four times with 1 volume of water-saturated diethyl ether, and passed through 0.45-μm pore size filters. Fractions were analyzed with a Waters high-pressure liquid chromatograph equipped with a Waters 2487 dual λ absorbance detector (set at 254 nm), a Waters 2475 multi λ fluorescence detector (excitation, 315 nm; emission, 415 nm), a Waters 600 controller, and a Waters 717plus autosampler. The column (4.6 × 150 mm) was a reversed-phase XBridgeTM C18 (particle size 5 μm) purchased from Waters Associates. The column was eluted isocratically with 50 mm ammonium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, plus methanol (89:11, v/v) at room temperature. Elution profiles were analyzed by Waters EmpowerTM chromatography software. Each experiment included a standard of N6-ethenoadenine in the appropriate buffer and internal standards obtained by adding known amounts of N6-ethenoadenine to the ethanol-soluble fractions from the control and PAP-treated RNA. The amount of adenine released from PAP-treated RNA was calculated from the standards after subtraction of the fluorescence reading given by control RNA. Wheat germ extract was purchased from Promega. Translation of TEV RNA was determined in luciferase assay buffer (25 mm Tricine, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm ETDA supplemented with 33 mm DTT, 0.25 mm coenzyme A, and 0.5 mm ATP) for luciferase activity. A 1.0-μg sample of TEV1–143-luc-A50 RNA was translated in a 200-μl reaction mixture containing 50 μl of complete wheat germ lysate extract, 50 units of RNase inhibitor, and 10 μm complete amino acid mixture (Promega). Luciferase activity for brome mosaic virus RNA provided by Promega was used as a control. Equimolar concentrations of PAP, WT VPg, or VPg-220 were added to the translational mixture as described under “Results.” Light emission was measured after the addition of 0.5 mm luciferin as a function of time using the PerkinElmer Gelience 600 imaging system. The fluorescent anthranoyl-m7GTP cap analog was synthesized as described previously (40Ren J. Goss D.J.

The pH of the resulting solution was adjusted to 9.6 with 2 n NaOH. To this solution with continuous stirring, crystalline isatoic anhydride (5 mg) was added. The pH of the mixture was maintained at 9.6 by titrating 2 n NaOH during the 2-h reaction. After the reaction was complete, the pH of the reaction mixture was adjusted to 7.0 with 1 n HCl solution. The reaction mixture containing the products and the unreacted materials was loaded onto a Sephadex LH-20 (2.4 × 56-cm) column equilibrated with autoclaved distilled water. The column was eluted with the same solvent at a flow rate of about 6 ml/h. Fractions of 1 ml were collected and assayed by TLC on silica gel. The plates were developed in system A (n-propyl alcohol/ammonia/water (6:3:1, v/v/v), containing 0.5 g/liter EDTA). The ant-m7GTP analog had brilliant blue fluorescence (monitored by a UV lamp), whereas anthranilic acid (a byproduct of this reaction) showed dark violet fluorescence. Peak fractions of the fluorescent analog were pooled, combined, and lyophilized in vacuo at liquid nitrogen temperature to prevent degradation. The resulting residue was then dissolved in a minimum amount of water (0.5 ml), and an excess of cold ethanol was added to induce the precipitation of the compound. The fluorescent cap analog was then dried in vacuo over phosphoric anhydride at 4 °C, giving an amorphous powder. Pokeweed antiviral protein was labeled with fluorescent N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS)-fluorescein reagent using the Pierce NHS-fluorescein antibody labeling kit (Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer's protocol. NHS-ester labeling reagents react efficiently with primary amines in the side chains of lysine residues of PAP. PAP storage buffer S was replaced with 50 mm sodium borate, pH 8.5, buffer, containing 1 mm DTT using Microcon® centrifugal filters (Millipore). The fluorophore/protein ratio was estimated spectrophotometrically in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) by measuring absorbance at 280 and 495 nm (i.e. Amax of NHS-fluorescein), A280/Amax = 0.3.

https://openalex.org/W1992531340,"Bone development is a dynamic process that requires cell motility and morphological adaptation under the control of actin cytoskeleton. This actin cytoskeleton system is regulated by critical modulators including actin-binding proteins. Among them, profilin1 (Pfn1) is a key player to control actin fiber structure, and it is involved in a number of cellular activities such as migration. During the early phase of body development, skeletal stem cells and osteoblastic progenitor cells migrate to form initial rudiments for future skeletons. During this migration, these cells extend their process based on actin cytoskeletal rearrangement to locate themselves in an appropriate location within microenvironment. However, the role of Pfn1 in regulation of mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPCs) during skeletal development is incompletely understood. Here we examined the role of Pfn1 in skeletal development using a genetic ablation of Pfn1 in MPCs by using Prx1-Cre recombinase. We found that Pfn1 deficiency in MPCs caused complete cleft sternum. Notably, Pfn1-deficient mice exhibited an absence of trabecular bone in the marrow space of appendicular long bone. This phenotype is location-specific, as Pfn1 deficiency did not largely affect osteoblasts in cortical bone. Pfn1 deficiency also suppressed longitudinal growth of long bone. In vitro, Pfn1 deficiency induced retardation of osteoblastic cell migration. These observations revealed that Pfn1 is a critical molecule for the skeletal development, and this could be at least in part associated with the retardation of cell migration."

A pathway was identified that involved integrin αv-mediated up-regulation of PKCα and PKCα-dependent regulation of p53 localization, which was connected to melanoma cell survival. Melanoma survival and growth in three-dimensional microenvironments requires the expression of integrin αv, which acts to suppress p53 activity. Interestingly, microarray analysis revealed that PKCα was up-regulated by integrin αv in a three-dimensional microenvironment-dependent manner. Integrin αv was observed to promote a relocalization of endogenous p53 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm upon growth in three-dimensional collagen as well as in vivo, whereas stable knockdown of PKCα inhibited the integrin αv-mediated relocalization of p53. Importantly, knockdown of PKCα also promoted apoptosis in three-dimensional collagen and in vivo, resulting in reduced tumor growth.

Here we report an exception that the cardiac muscle of toad (Bufo) expresses exclusively slow skeletal muscle TnT (ssTnT) together with cardiac forms of troponin I and myosin as determined using immunoblotting, cDNA cloning, and/or LC-MS/MS. Using RT-PCR and 3'- and 5'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends on toad cardiac mRNA, we cloned full-length cDNAs encoding two alternatively spliced variants of ssTnT. Expression of the cloned cDNAs in Escherichia coli confirmed that the toad cardiac muscle expresses solely ssTnT, predominantly the low molecular weight variant with the exon 5-encoded NH(2)-terminal segment spliced out. Functional studies were performed in ex vivo working toad hearts and compared with the frog (Rana) hearts. The results showed that toad hearts had higher contractile and relaxation velocities and were able to work against a significantly higher afterload than that of frog hearts. Therefore, the unique evolutionary adaptation of utilizing exclusively ssTnT in toad cardiac muscle corresponded to a fitness value from improving systolic function of the heart. The data demonstrated a physiological importance of the functional diversity of TnT isoforms. The structure-function relationship of TnT may be explored for the development of new treatment of heart failure."

In the depolymerization of cellulose, cellulases can play a key role. Cellulases can be classified into three major types according to their mode of catalytic action. (i) Endoglucanases (EC 3.2.1.4) cut randomly at internal amorphous sites in the cellulose polysaccharide chains. (ii) Exoglucanases including exo-1,4-β-glucosidases (EC 3.2.1.74) and exocellobiohydrolases (EC 3.2.1.91) act on the ends of cellulose chains. (iii) β-Glucosidases (EC 3.2.1.21) hydrolyze soluble cellodextrins and cellobiose (7Lynd L.R. Weimer P.J. van Zyl W.H. Pretorius I.S.

Multiple forms of cellulases work together to convert cellulose into fermentable sugars, and most commercial cellulase products for cellulose conversion are multicomponent. However, the available technologies for cellulose conversion require high enzyme loads, thus eliminating the cost advantage of converting abundant and low cost cellulosic biomass (5United States Department of EnergyBreaking the Biological Barriers to Cellulosic Ethanol: a Joint Research Agenda.

Natural cellulose, which is mainly found in plant cell walls, is primarily crystalline cellulose. Its cellulose molecules are long unbranched linear chains linked by β-1,4-glycosidic bonds, and the chains are precisely arranged in parallel. As a result, they form a compact crystalline structure through strong interchain hydrogen-bonding networks, which make crystalline cellulose insoluble, stable, less accessible, and resistant to degradation (3Himmel M.E. Ding S.Y. Johnson D.K. Adney W.S. Nimlos M.R. Brady J.W. Foust T.D.

Cellulases can only hydrolyze the amorphous regions of cellulose or the two ends of the cellulose chains of crystalline cellulose surfaces (7Lynd L.R. Weimer P.J. van Zyl W.H. Pretorius I.S.

In other words, no matter how high the cellulase load, only a tiny part of crystalline cellulose is exposed to cellulases. The compactness and resistance of crystalline structures are the bottleneck in the efficient degradation of natural cellulose. The looseness and disruption of crystalline structures are therefore more important (12Arantes V. Saddler J.N.

They non-hydrolytically loosen, peel, split, or disrupt the packaging of crystalline cellulose and then convert it into its amorphous form, which can be readily hydrolyzed by cellulase.

The CBMs related to cellulose, which were originally defined as cellulose-binding domains, can be divided into several families according to the CAZy classification. Because of their binding and disruptive functions toward crystalline cellulose (17Boraston A.B. Bolam D.N. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J.

The binding functions of CBMs can be analyzed quantitatively (22Moser F. Irwin D. Chen S. Wilson D.B. Regulation and characterization of Thermobifida fusca carbohydrate-binding module proteins E7 and E8.Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2008; 100: 1066-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), but these functions cannot characterize the disruptive functions of CBMs. As yet, there is no convenient method available for quantitatively analyzing the disruptive functions of CBMs. Because CBMs only rearrange segments of cellulose chains and do not release any new molecules, the non-hydrolytic disruption of crystalline cellulose by CBMs cannot be sensitively, directly, and conveniently quantified. Heterologous CBMs and catalytic modules of cellulase can be united into simplified cellulosomes (23Carrard G. Koivula A. Söderlund H. Béguin P.

The resulting cellulosomes or chimeric cellulases showed improved activities on crystalline cellulose as a result of the synergism between the CBMs and the catalytic modules. The enhancement of hydrolytic activities on crystalline cellulose may indirectly reflect the disruptive functions of CBMs. However, these studies were sporadic and not systematic, and the disruptive activities of various CBMs cannot be compared with each other. In this work, we developed a strategy for quantitatively analyzing the disruptive activities of CBMs utilizing the synergism of CBMs and catalytic modules. The endoglucanase FnCel5A, which can rapidly hydrolyze non-crystalline cellulose and does not hydrolyze crystalline cellulose (28Wang Y. Wang X. Tang R. Yu S. Zheng B. Feng Y. A novel thermostable cellulase from Fervidobacterium nodosum.J. Mol. Catal. B Enzym. 2010; 66: 294-301Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar), was used; the complementary combination of FnCel5A and CBMs can hydrolyze crystalline cellulose to release detectable sugars in a synergistic manner. We constructed a cellulase matrix containing FnCel5A in which heterologous CBMs could be inserted to form a series of chimeric cellulases. By investigating the activities of these chimeric cellulases, we could investigate the characteristics of CBMs. We assembled the protein sequence information from the CAZy database (9Cantarel B.L. Coutinho P.M. Rancurel C. Bernard T. Lombard V. Henrissat B. The Carbohydrate-Active enZymes database (CAZy): an expert resource for glycogenomics.Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: D233-D238Crossref PubMed Scopus (4114) Google Scholar); the information was classified, annotated, and linked by CAZy. From the CAZy web page of glycoside hydrolase family 5 (GH5) in August 2010, we chose the proteins that were annotated with appropriate EC (Enzyme Commission) numbers and then collected the non-redundant protein sequences of those proteins via the CAZy web page links. We used these protein sequences to request the simple modular architecture research tool (SMART) (29Schultz J. Milpetz F. Bork P. Ponting C.P.

We only reserved the sequences of enzymatic catalytic modules (catalytic domains) and CBMs present in GH5 enzymes. If there was more than one module in a protein sequence, we divided the sequence into several new independent sequences with only one module. These edited polypeptide sequences were used for the next phylogenetic analysis. ClustalX 2.0.12 (31Larkin M.A. Blackshields G. Brown N.P. Chenna R. McGettigan P.A. McWilliam H. Valentin F.

Clustal W and Clustal X version 2.0.Bioinformatics. 2007; 23: 2947-2948Crossref PubMed Scopus (22512) Google Scholar) was used for alignments with default parameters. The phylogenetic trees of catalytic modules and CBMs were individually reconstructed. The maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees were reconstructed using the PhyML v3.0 (32Guindon S. Gascuel O. A simple, fast, and accurate algorithm to estimate large phylogenies by maximum likelihood.Syst. Biol. 2003; 52: 696-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (14201) Google Scholar) program under the LG + Γ (four rate categories; estimated α) model of amino acid substitution and with 100 bootstrap replicates and were displayed using MEGA4 software (33Kumar S. Nei M. Dudley J. Tamura K. MEGA: a biologist-centric software for evolutionary analysis of DNA and protein sequences.Brief. Bioinformatics. 2008; 9: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (2856) Google Scholar). Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo phylogenetic analyses were performed using the BEAST (34Drummond A.J. Rambaut A. BEAST: Bayesian evolutionary analysis by sampling trees.BMC Evol. Biol. 2007; 7: 214Crossref PubMed Scopus (10076) Google Scholar) program under the JTT + Γ + I + strict model with four γ rate categories. The analysis of GH5 catalytic modules was run for 47 million Markov chain Monte Carlo steps, and the analysis of CBMs in GH5 enzymes was run for 100 million Markov chain Monte Carlo steps. All Markov chain Monte Carlo output results were analyzed using the program Tracer 1.5. The Bayesian phylogenetic trees were displayed using FigTree 1.3.1. The gene fncel5a coding the endoglucanase was cloned from Fervidobacterium nodosum Rt17-B1 (DSMZ 5306; ATCC 35602) and was amplified by PCR. The amplified gene was digested with NdeI and BamHI and inserted into the similarly restricted vector pET-11a (Novagen) to yield the expression plasmid pFnCel5A. The endoglucanase cellulase FnCel5A was solubly overproduced in the Escherichia coli BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL strain (Stratagene) harboring pFnCel5A. The experimental procedures of cloning, production, purification, and characterization were the same as those described previously (28Wang Y. Wang X. Tang R. Yu S. Zheng B. Feng Y. A novel thermostable cellulase from Fervidobacterium nodosum.J. Mol. Catal. B Enzym. 2010; 66: 294-301Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Based on the characteristics of the Pro/Thr-rich linker in endoglucanase H from Clostridium thermocellum (P16218), which is closely related to FnCel5A (supplemental Fig. S2), we designed a linker sequence (Fig. 2b) and added it to the downstream sequence of FnCel5A in plasmid pFnCel5A using the rapid PCR site-directed mutagenesis method (35Weiner M.P. Costa G.L. Rapid PCR site-directed mutagenesis.PCR Methods Appl. 1994; 4: S131-S136Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The primers 5′-TGAAGGTTTCGGAGAATAAGACGGATATGTCCCGGGTCCAAGTGCAGAGGT-3′ and 5′-CCAAGACCGACCAAACCGCCCGTAGCTAGCTGATAAGGATCCGGCTGCTAAC-3′ were used to amplify the whole plasmid of pFnCel5A. PCR amplification, used to create an insertion of the designed linker sequence, was performed using Pfu DNA polymerase (Fermentas). After 18 cycles of PCR, the sample was incubated with the restriction enzyme DpnI (Fermentas) for 3 h at 37 °C to remove the methylated template and concentrated by ethanol precipitation. The resulting product was transformed into E. coli XL-blue (Stratagene), and plasmid preparations of individual colonies were screened by restriction enzyme digestion for the insertion mutation, i.e. pFnCel5A-linker. The DNA sequences of the candidate plasmid were sequenced to verify identity with the anticipated sequence of pFnCel5A-linker. At the end of the linker sequence in pFnCel5A-linker, there are NheI and BamHI restriction sites (Fig. 2b) for inserting a heterologous CBM to form a novel chimeric cellulase. The CBMs used in this work are summarized in supplemental Table S1. pGCip2, pGCCip4, and pGCCip6 (23Carrard G. Koivula A. Söderlund H. Béguin P.

Processivity, substrate binding, and mechanism of cellulose hydrolysis by Thermobifida fusca Cel9A.Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2007; 73: 3165-3172Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) were from Diana C. Irwin (Cornell University, Ithaca, NY). The DNA fragments encoding TrCBM1-1, TrCBM1-2, CfCBM2, TfCBM2a, and TfCBM2 were amplified by PCR using the corresponding primers (supplemental Table S2), which supplied NheI and BamHI restriction sites, and respectively cloned into a suitable digested pFnCel5A-linker to generate pFnCel5A-TrCBM1-1, pFnCel5A-TrCBM1-2, pFnCel5A-CfCBM2, pFnCel5A-TfCBM2a, and pFnCel5A-TfCBM2 (Fig. 2c). These recombinant plasmids were transformed into the E. coli BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL strain (Stratagene) to produce the chimeric cellulases FnCel5A-TrCBM1-1, FnCel5A-TrCBM1-2, FnCel5A-CfCBM2, FnCel5A-TfCBM2a, and FnCel5A-TfCBM2, respectively. The E. coli cells were cultured in 2 × YT medium (1.6% tryptone, 1% yeast extract, and 0.5% NaCl) and induced to produce the chimeric cellulases by isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside. The cells were harvested, suspended, and disintegrated. After centrifugation, the chimeric cellulases in the supernatant were purified using a Q Sepharose Fast Flow (anion exchange) column (GE Healthcare). Enzyme purity was determined by SDS-PAGE analysis. Protein concentrations were determined according to the Bradford method, and bovine serum albumin was used as the standard. The chimeric cellulases were produced, purified, and determined as described for FnCel5A (28Wang Y. Wang X. Tang R. Yu S. Zheng B. Feng Y. A novel thermostable cellulase from Fervidobacterium nodosum.J. Mol. Catal. B Enzym. 2010; 66: 294-301Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar) with slight changes. In this study, the chimeric cellulase FnCel5A-CBMs include FnCel5A-TrCBM1-1, FnCel5A-TrCBM1-2, FnCel5A-CfCBM2, FnCel5A-TfCBM2a, and FnCel5A-TfCBM2, and their DNA sequences have been deposited in GenBank under accession numbers JN590045, JN590046, JN590047, JN590048, and JN590049, respectively. The hydrolytic activities of the FnCel5A and chimeric cellulases were measured after 5 or 30 min of incubation at a certain temperature in 50 mm phosphate, citrate buffer in the presence of 1% (w/v) substrate (carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) or Avicel). We used CMC (sodium salt, medium viscosity; Fluka) as the amorphous cellulose. We used Avicel (PH-101; Fluka) as the crystalline cellulose in our laboratory experiments because it has been treated to remove hemicelluloses and more extensive amorphous regions of cellulose fibers (7Lynd L.R. Weimer P.J. van Zyl W.H. Pretorius I.S. Microbial cellulose utilization: fundamentals and biotechnology.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 506-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (3541) Google Scholar). The reducing sugars released from the substrates were determined using 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid reagent (38Miller G.L. Use of dinitrosalicylic acid reagent for determination of reducing sugar.Anal. Chem. 1959; 31: 426-428Crossref Scopus (22217) Google Scholar). If the amount of reducing sugars was too small to be determined, we prolonged the incubation time or increased the enzyme concentration as appropriate. One unit (IU) of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that releases 1 μmol of reducing sugars/min. With CMC as the substrate, the pH and temperature optima of FnCel5A and the chimeric cellulases were determined by measuring the release of reducing sugars from CMC. The pH optimum was determined by measuring the enzyme activity at 83 °C in various pH buffers. The temperature optimum was determined in 50 mm phosphate, citrate buffer (pH 5.2) at different temperatures. The pH dependence of chimeric cellulase activities on Avicel was examined by measuring the hydrolytic activities in various pH buffers at 50 °C. The temperature dependence of their activities on Avicel was investigated by determining the hydrolytic activities at different temperatures and in 50 mm phosphate, citrate buffer at their own optimal pH, which had been determined in the aforementioned analysis of their pH dependence. Thermal stability studies were performed by incubating about 2 mg/ml purified enzymes for various lengths of time at different batches of temperatures in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.0). The residual activities of the chimeric cellulases against Avicel were determined at 50 °C and pH 5.2. The initial coordinates of the endoglucanase FnCel5A were taken from its crystal structure (Protein Data Bank code 3NCO). Among the CBMs used in this study (supplemental Table S1), the NMR structures of TrCBM1-1 and CfCBM2 are available, and their initial coordinates were obtained from the Protein Data Bank (codes 1CBH and 1EXG, respectively). Using the linker sequence (shown in Fig. 2b), we built and optimized an initial conformation for the linker using a previously described method (39Simmerling C. Strockbine B. Roitberg A.E. All-atom structure prediction and folding simulations of a stable protein.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 11258-11259Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Finally, we joined the structures of FnCel5A (optimized by 12-ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulation in explicit solvent at 323 K), the linker, and the CBMs together to build the initial structures of the chimeric cellulase FnCel5A-CBMs using the InsightII package (Accelrys, San Diego, CA). All MD simulations were unrestrained and carried out in the canonical ensemble using the sander module of AMBER version 11 (40Case D.A. Darden T.A. Cheatham III, T.E. Simmerling C.L. Wang J.

https://openalex.org/W2019322131,"Gene conversion is one of the frequent end results of homologous recombination, and it often underlies the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes in cancer cells. Here, we have developed an integrated assay system that allows simultaneous examination of double-strand break (DSB)-induced gene conversion events at the site of a DSB (proximal region) and at a surrounding region ~1 kb away from the break (distal region). Utilizing this assay system, we find that gene conversion events at the proximal and distal regions are relatively independent of one another. The results also indicate that synthesis-dependent strand annealing (SDSA) plays a major role in DSB-induced gene conversion. In addition, our current study has demonstrated that hMLH1 plays an essential role in anti-recombination and gene conversion. Specifically, the anti-recombination activity of hMLH1 is partially dependent on its interaction with hMRE11. Our data suggests that the role of hMLH1 and hMRE11 in the process of gene conversion is complex, and these proteins play different roles in DSB-induced proximal and distal gene conversions. In particular, the involvement of hMLH1 and hMRE11 in the distal gene conversion requires both hMSH2 and heteroduplex formation."
https://openalex.org/W2041194186,"The prolactin-releasing peptide receptor and its bioactive RF-amide peptide (PrRP20) have been investigated to explore the ligand binding mode of peptide G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). By receptor mutagenesis, we identified the conserved aspartate in the upper transmembrane helix 6 (Asp(6.59)) of the receptor as the first position that directly interacts with arginine 19 of the ligand (Arg(19)). Replacement of Asp(6.59) with Arg(19) of PrRP20 led to D6.59R, which turned out to be a constitutively active receptor mutant (CAM). This suggests that the mutated residue at the top of transmembrane helix 6 mimics Arg(19) by interacting with additional binding partners in the receptor. Next, we generated an initial comparative model of this CAM because no ligand docking was required, and we selected the next set of receptor mutants to find the engaged partners of the binding pocket. In an iterative process, we identified two acidic residues and two hydrophobic residues that form the peptide ligand binding pocket. As all residues are localized on top or in the upper part of the transmembrane domains, we clearly can show that the extracellular surface of the receptor is sufficient for full signal transduction for prolactin-releasing peptide, rather than a deep, membrane-embedded binding pocket. This contributes to the knowledge of the binding of peptide ligands to GPCRs and might facilitate the development of GPCR ligands, but it also provides new targeting of CAMs involved in hereditary diseases."
