https://openalex.org/W1969815211,"Single crystals of the layered organic-inorganic perovskites, [NH2C(I)=NH2]2(CH3NH3)m SnmI3m+2, were prepared by an aqueous solution growth technique. In contrast to the recently discovered family, (C4H9NH3)2(CH3NH3)n-1SnnI3n+1, which consists of 〈100〉-terminated perovskite layers, structure determination reveals an unusual structural class with sets of m 〈110〉-oriented CH3NH3SnI3 perovskite sheets separated by iodoformamidinium cations. Whereas the m = 2 compound is semiconducting with a band gap of 0.33 ± 0.05 electron volt, increasing m leads to more metallic character. The ability to control perovskite sheet orientation through the choice of organic cation demonstrates the flexibility provided by organic-inorganic perovskites and adds an important handle for tailoring and understanding lower dimensional transport in layered perovskites."
https://openalex.org/W2014140929,"Conformational data for macromolecules in the gas phase have been obtained by the coupling of a matrix-assisted laser desorption ion source to an ion chromatograph. A series of polyethylene glycol (PEG) polymers ""cationized"" (converted to a cation) by sodium ions (Na(+)PEG9 to Na(+)PEG19) and a protonated neurotransmitter protein, bradykinin, were studied. Mobilities of Na(+)PEG9 to Na(+)PEG19 are reported. Detailed modeling of Na(+)PEG9 with molecular mechanics methods indicates that the lowest energy structure has the Na(+) ion ""solvated"" by the polymer chain with seven oxygen atoms as nearest neighbors. The agreement between the model and experiment is within 1 percent for Na(+)PEG9, Na(+)PEG13, and Na(+)PEG17, giving strong support to both the method and the deduced structures. Similar agreement was obtained in initial studies that modeled experimental data for arginine-protonated bradykinin."

X-ray structure determinations revealed a superlattice framework built up of covalently linked clusters. This superlattice is best described as two enlarged and interlaced diamond or zinc blende lattices. Because both the superlattice and the clusters display the same structural features, the crystal structure resembles the self-similarities known from fractal geometry. The optical spectrum of the cluster solution displays a sharp transition around 290 nanometers with a large absorption coefficient ( approximately 84,000 per molar per centimeter)."
https://openalex.org/W2014267240,"A method for the fabrication of micrometer-and submicrometer-sized polymeric light-emitting diodes is presented. Such diodes have a variety of applications. Light sources of dimensions around 100 nanometers are required for subwavelength, near-field optical microscopy. Another possible application is patterning on the micrometer and nanometer scale. The diodes have been made in the form of a sandwich structure, with the conductive polymer poly(3,4-ethylene-dioxythiophene) polymerized in the pores of commercially available microfiltration membranes defining the hole-injecting contacts, poly[3-(4-octylphenyl)-2,2;-bithiophene] as the light-emitting layer, and a thin film of calcium-aluminum as the electron injector."
https://openalex.org/W2036458171,"A newly available data set of daily satellite-derived, lower-tropospheric global temperature anomalies provides an opportunity to assess the influence of lunar phase on planetary temperature. These results reveal a statistically significant 0.02 K modulation between new moon and full moon, with the warmest daily global temperatures over a synodic month coincident with the occurrence of the full moon. Spectral analysis of the daily temperature record confirms the presence of a periodicity that matches the lunar synodic (29.53-day) cycle. The precision of the satellite-based daily temperature record allows verification that the moon exerts a discernible influence on the short-term, global temperature record."

https://openalex.org/W1985336073,"The chemical composition of the solar corona is not the same as that of the underlying photosphere. In the corona, elements with a first ionization potential (FIP) of </=10 electron volts (for example, iron, magnesium, silicon, and calcium) are overabundant relative to those with an FIP of >/=10 electron volts (for example, oxygen, neon, and sulfur) by factors of 3 to 10 with respect to the photosphere. The origin of this FIP effect is unknown. The launch of the Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer Satellite (EUVE) opened up the spectroscopic capability required to determine elemental abundances in the coronae of other stars. Spectroscopic observations of the corona of the nearby F5 IV star Procyon obtained with EUVE have yielded estimates of the relative abundances of high- and low-FIP species. The results provide evidence that Procyon, unlike the sun, does not exhibit the FIP effect. Whether the sun or Procyon is more typical of the general late-type stellar population is of fundamental interest to the physics of stellar outer atmospheres and has a bearing on the origin of cosmic rays."

The idea to `corporatize` the labs is not popular with DOE or lab officials. This article discusses opposing views of a reform plan."
