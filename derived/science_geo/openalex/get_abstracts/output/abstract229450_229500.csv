https://openalex.org/W2033797333,"Skeletal muscle atrophy is a debilitating response to fasting, disuse, cancer, and other systemic diseases. In atrophying muscles, the ubiquitin ligase, atrogin-1 (MAFbx), is dramatically induced, and this response is necessary for rapid atrophy. Here, we show that in cultured myotubes undergoing atrophy, the activity of the PI3K/AKT pathway decreases, leading to activation of Foxo transcription factors and atrogin-1 induction. IGF-1 treatment or AKT overexpression inhibits Foxo and atrogin-1 expression. Moreover, constitutively active Foxo3 acts on the atrogin-1 promoter to cause atrogin-1 transcription and dramatic atrophy of myotubes and muscle fibers. When Foxo activation is blocked by a dominant-negative construct in myotubes or by RNAi in mouse muscles in vivo, atrogin-1 induction during starvation and atrophy of myotubes induced by glucocorticoids are prevented. Thus, forkhead factor(s) play a critical role in the development of muscle atrophy, and inhibition of Foxo factors is an attractive approach to combat muscle wasting."

https://openalex.org/W1970728706,"Coffin-Lowry Syndrome (CLS) is an X-linked mental retardation condition associated with skeletal abnormalities. The gene mutated in CLS, RSK2, encodes a growth factor-regulated kinase. However, the cellular and molecular bases of the skeletal abnormalities associated with CLS remain unknown. Here, we show that RSK2 is required for osteoblast differentiation and function. We identify the transcription factor ATF4 as a critical substrate of RSK2 that is required for the timely onset of osteoblast differentiation, for terminal differentiation of osteoblasts, and for osteoblast-specific gene expression. Additionally, RSK2 and ATF4 posttranscriptionally regulate the synthesis of Type I collagen, the main constituent of the bone matrix. Accordingly, Atf4-deficiency results in delayed bone formation during embryonic development and low bone mass throughout postnatal life. These findings identify ATF4 as a critical regulator of osteoblast differentiation and function, and indicate that lack of ATF4 phosphorylation by RSK2 may contribute to the skeletal phenotype of CLS."

https://openalex.org/W2139520473,"The expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) has been linked with tumor invasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis. However, the molecular basis for MMP-2 overexpression in tumor cells remains unclear. In this study, by using K-1735 melanoma system, we demonstrated that highly metastatic C4, M2, and X21 tumor cells express elevated MMP-2 mRNA and enzymatic activity, whereas poorly metastatic C10, C19, and C23 tumor cells express much lower levels. Moreover, a concomitant elevated Stat3 activity has been detected in these metastatic tumor cells that overexpress MMP-2. Transfection of constitutively activated Stat3 into poorly metastatic C23 tumor cells directly activated the MMP-2 promoter, whereas the expression of a dominant-negative Stat3 in highly metastatic C4 tumor cells inhibited the MMP-2 promoter. A high-affinity Stat3-binding element was identified in the MMP-2 promoter and Stat3 protein bound directly to the MMP-2 promoter. Blockade of activated Stat3 through expression of a dominant-negative Stat3 significantly suppressed MMP-2 expression in the metastatic tumor cells. Therefore, overexpression of MMP-2 in the metastatic melanoma cells can be attributed to elevated Stat3 activity, and Stat3 upregulates the transcription of MMP-2 through direct interaction with the MMP-2 promoter. Furthermore, blockade of activated Stat3 in highly metastatic C4 cells significantly suppressed the invasiveness of the tumor cells, inhibited tumor growth, and prevented metastasis in nude mice. Collectively, these studies suggest that Stat3 signaling directly regulates MMP-2 expression, tumor invasion, and metastasis, and that Stat3 activation might be a crucial event in the development of metastasis."

We have identified the bromodomain protein Brd4 as a major cellular interacting partner of the bovine papillomavirus E2. Brd4 associates with mitotic chromosomes and colocalizes with E2 on mitotic chromosomes. The site of E2 binding maps to the C-terminal domain of Brd4. Expression of this C-terminal Brd4 domain functions in a dominant-negative manner to abrogate the colocalization of E2 with Brd4 on mitotic chromosomes, to block association of the viral episomes with Brd4, and to inhibit BPV-1 DNA-mediated cellular transformation. Brd4 also associates with HPV16 E2, indicating that Brd4 binding may be a shared property of all papillomavirus E2 proteins. The interaction of E2 with Brd4 is required to ensure the tethering of viral genomes to the host mitotic chromosomes for persistence of viral episomes in PV-infected cells."

https://openalex.org/W2052418918,"tRNA splicing is a fundamental process required for cell growth and division. The first step in tRNA splicing is the removal of introns catalyzed in yeast by the tRNA splicing endonuclease. The enzyme responsible for intron removal in mammalian cells is unknown. We present the identification and characterization of the human tRNA splicing endonuclease. This enzyme consists of HsSen2, HsSen34, HsSen15, and HsSen54, homologs of the yeast tRNA endonuclease subunits. Additionally, we identified an alternatively spliced isoform of SEN2 that is part of a complex with unique RNA endonuclease activity. Surprisingly, both human endonuclease complexes are associated with pre-mRNA 3' end processing factors. Furthermore, siRNA-mediated depletion of SEN2 exhibited defects in maturation of both pre-tRNA and pre-mRNA. These findings demonstrate a link between pre-tRNA splicing and pre-mRNA 3' end formation, suggesting that the endonuclease subunits function in multiple RNA-processing events."

https://openalex.org/W2102392672,"Phosphorylation is the most common posttranslational modification of the α-crystallins in the human lens. These phosphorylated forms are not only important because of their abundance in aging lenses and the implications for cataract but also because they have been identified in patients with degenerative brain disease. By using mimics corresponding to the reported <i>in vivo</i> phosphorylation sites in the human lens, we have examined the effects of phosphorylation upon the chaperone-like properties and structure of αB-crystallin. Here we show that phosphorylation of αB-crystallin at Ser-45 results in uncontrolled aggregation. By using an innovative tandem mass spectrometry approach, we demonstrate how this alteration in behavior stems from disruption of dimeric substructure within the polydisperse αB-crystallin assembly. This structural perturbation appears to disturb the housekeeping role of αB-crystallin and consequently has important implications for the disease states caused by protein aggregation in the lens and deposition in non-lenticular tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2086549703,"Overexpression of fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) tyrosine kinases has been found in many human breast cancers and has been associated with poor patient prognosis. In order to understand the mechanism by which FGFR mediates breast cancer cell proliferation, we used a low molecular weight compound, PD173074, that selectively inhibits FGFR tyrosine kinase activity and autophosphorylation. This potential anticancer agent caused a G1 growth arrest of MDA-MB-415, MDA-MB-453 and SUM 52 breast cancer cells. Our analyses revealed that FGFR signaling links to the cell cycle machinery via D-type cyclins. PD173074-mediated inhibition of FGFR activity caused downregulation of cyclin D1 and cyclin D2 expression, inhibition of cyclin D/cdk4 activity and, as a consequence, reduction of pRB phosphorylation. Retroviral-mediated ectopic expression of cyclin D1 prevented pRB hypophosphorylation and the cell cycle G1 block in PD173074-treated cells, suggesting a central role for D cyclins in proliferation of FGFR-driven breast cancer cells. The repression of FGFR activity caused downregulation of MAPK in MDA-MB-415 and MDA-MB-453 cells. In SUM 52 cells, both MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways were suppressed. In conclusion, results shown here describe a mechanism by which FGFR promotes proliferation of breast cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2061202161,"Tristetraprolin (TTP) binds AU-rich elements (AREs) encoded within selected labile mRNAs and targets these transcripts for rapid cytoplasmic decay. RNA binding by TTP is mediated by an ∼70-amino acid domain containing two tandemly arrayed CCCH zinc fingers. Here we show that a 73-amino acid peptide spanning the TTP zinc finger domain, denoted TTP73, forms a dynamic, equimolar RNA·peptide complex with a 13-nucleotide fragment of the ARE from tumor necrosis factor α mRNA, which includes small but significant contributions from ionic interactions.

Cytoplasmic mRNA stability is an important mechanism in the regulation of gene expression. In mammalian cells, some mRNAs encoding regulatory proteins like cytokines, inflammatory mediators, and oncoproteins decay very quickly, often exhibiting cytoplasmic half-lives of 30 min or less (reviewed in Refs. 1Ross J.

Rapid turnover of these mRNAs is mediated by AU-rich elements (AREs), 1The abbreviations used are: ARE, AU-rich element; TTP, tristetraprolin; Cy5, cyanine-5; Fl, fluorescein; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; GMSA, gel mobility shift assay; RNP, ribonucleoprotein; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor α. a loosely defined collection of uridylate-rich sequences localized to the 3′-untranslated regions of many labile transcripts. The increased turnover rates of ARE-containing transcripts are typically manifested through acceleration of deadenylation, where the poly(A) tail is progressively shortened in a 3′ → 5′ direction prior to extremely rapid degradation of the mRNA body (reviewed in Ref. 4Chen C.-Y.A. Shyu A.-B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 465-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1688) Google Scholar). The mRNA-destabilizing activity of AREs is mediated by association of cytoplasmic trans-acting factors (reviewed in Ref. 5Wilson G.M. Brewer G. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1999; 62: 257-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Some factors, like members of the Hu family of RNA-binding proteins, prevent mRNA degradation (6Peng S.S.Y. Chen C.-Y.A. Xu N.

Association of tristetraprolin (TTP) with ARE-containing mRNAs also promotes their rapid cytoplasmic catabolism, involving acceleration of deadenylation rates (12Lai W.S. Carballo E. Thorn J.M.

The significance of this mechanism is apparent from a TTP knock-out mouse model, where enhanced stability of tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) mRNA in macrophages from TTP-deficient mice (14Carballo E. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) produces constitutive enhancement of circulating TNFα, ultimately leading to development of a systemic inflammatory syndrome (15Taylor G.A.

TTP is the prototype of the CCCH family of eukaryotic tandem zinc finger proteins (reviewed in Ref. 16Blackshear P.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 945-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Interactions with selected AU-rich RNA substrates occur through the zinc finger domain, which is necessary and sufficient for high affinity RNA recognition (12Lai W.S. Carballo E. Thorn J.M.

Preliminary characterization of TTP substrate selectivity suggests a preference for RNA sequences containing AUUUA motifs, common among AREs from mRNAs encoding cytokines/lymphokines and inflammatory mediators (17Park-Lee S.

However, the apparent selectivity of TTP for a subset of ARE targets, coupled with the existence of several ARE-binding proteins promoting common functions (i.e. mRNA destabilization), underscores the need to understand the biophysical basis for RNA substrate preferences of these trans-acting factors. In this study, we continue our examination of sequence-specific RNA recognition by trans-acting, ARE-binding factors by evaluating interactions between the zinc finger domain of TTP and model ARE substrates. A previous study employing a synthetic 73-amino acid peptide containing the tandem zinc fingers of TTP, termed TTP73, demonstrated that specific RNA·peptide complexes could be formed in solution using RNA substrates spanning regions of the ARE from TNFα mRNA (20Blackshear P.J.

Here we have used the interaction between the TTP73 peptide and a series of short RNA oligonucleotide substrates to characterize the thermodynamics, dissociation kinetics, and substrate requirements of TTP73·RNA complexes. While providing information about the dynamics and physical forces contributing to ARE recognition by the TTP zinc finger domain, this work also presents thermodynamic evidence supporting preliminary NMR data that indicated a conformational change in the TTP73 peptide accompanying association with high affinity RNA substrates (20Blackshear P.J.

Subsequent studies using mutant RNA substrates provide evidence that conformational changes in the peptide·RNA complex are coupled to high affinity binding and are linked to the presence of two adenylate residues within a U-rich RNA sequence, thus establishing a thermodynamic basis for discrimination of RNA substrates by TTP. Furthermore, the moderately rapid dissociation kinetics of RNA complexes containing the TTP zinc finger domain support a model of regulated mRNA turnover involving dynamic competition between various ARE-binding proteins in the cytoplasm. RNA Substrates—Sequences of RNA oligonucleotides used in this study are listed in Table I. Synthesis, deprotection of 2′-hydroxyl groups, and purification of RNA substrates were performed by Dharmacon Research (Lafayette, CO) or Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Dried RNA pellets were resuspended in 10 mm Tris·HCl (pH 8.0) and quantified by A260/A495 as described previously (21Wilson G.M. Sun Y. Lu H. Brewer G. J. Biol.

For RNA substrate Fl-ARE-AU3A-Cy5, contributions of the cyanine-5 (Cy5) moiety to A260 and A495 were considered negligible. Where indicated, 5′-hydroxyl RNA substrates were radiolabeled to specific activities of 3–5 × 103 cpm/fmol using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP as described (21Wilson G.M. Sun Y. Lu H.

Open table in a new tab Synthetic Peptide Containing the TTP Tandem Zinc Finger Domain—A 73-amino acid peptide corresponding to residues 102–174 of human TTP (GenBank™ accession number NP_003398, Fig. 1A) was synthesized, purified, and refolded by Albachem Ltd. (Edinburgh, Scotland, UK), as described previously (20Blackshear P.J. Lai W.S. Kennington E.A. Brewer G. Wilson G.M. Guan X. Zhou P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19947-19955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and is termed TTP73. Lyophilized TTP73 peptide was resuspended in 10 mm Tris·HCl (pH 8.0) containing 2 mm dithiothreitol and frozen in aliquots at –80 °C. Recovered peptide was quantified by Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE against a titration of bovine serum albumin. The isoelectric point and pH dependence of net charge for the TTP73 peptide were calculated using the pI application of the Biology Workbench version 3.2 (San Diego Supercomputer Center; www.workbench.sdsc.edu). Gel Mobility Shift Assays (GMSAs)—Binding reactions including varying concentrations of TTP73 peptide and 0.2 nm32P-labeled RNA substrate were assembled in a final volume of 10 μl containing 10 mm Tris·HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 μg/μl bovine serum albumin, and 10% glycerol. Heparin (0.2 μg/μl) was included to inhibit nonspecific RNA binding activity. Where indicated, ZnCl2 (5 μm) or EDTA (0.5 mm) were also included in binding reactions. Prior to addition of RNA substrates, the TTP73 peptide was incubated for 20 min at room temperature in the binding mixture to permit coordination of Zn2+. Preliminary experiments indicated significantly poorer RNA binding activity for TTP73 when this Zn2+ coordination step was omitted (data not shown). Upon introduction of RNA substrates, binding reactions were incubated on ice for 15 min and then fractionated by electrophoresis through 6% (40:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide) native gels at 4 °C. Following electrophoresis, gels were dried, and the location of reaction products was identified by PhosphorImager scan (Amersham Biosciences). Fluorescence Anisotropy Assays—For quantitative analyses of RNA-protein binding equilibria, a fluorescence anisotropy-based assay was employed, similar to that described previously (21Wilson G.M. Sun Y. Lu H. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33374-33381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 23Wilson G.M. Sutphen K. Chuang K. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8695-8704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Briefly, fluorescein (Fl)-labeled RNA substrates were incubated with TTP73 in reactions similar to those described for GMSAs (above), except that glycerol was omitted; final volume was brought to 100 μl, and binding reactions were performed at 25 °C unless otherwise noted. Fluorescence anisotropy was measured with a Beacon 2000 Fluorescence Polarization System (Panvera, Madison, WI) using fluorescein excitation (λex = 490 nm) and emission (λem = 535 nm) filters. Association of TTP73 with Fl-RNA substrates was detected by an increase in anisotropy of Fl-RNA emission, because of restricted segmental motion and retarded rotational correlation time in the RNA·protein complex relative to the free RNA substrate (23Wilson G.M. Sutphen K. Chuang K. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8695-8704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 24Jameson D.M. Sawyer W.H.

In all experiments reported in this work, protein binding did not induce a change in the fluorescence quantum yield of Fl-RNA substrates. As such, the measured fluorescence anisotropy (At) of each binding reaction was interpreted as a function of the intrinsic anisotropy (Ai) and fractional concentration (fi) of each fluorescent species using Equation 1 (24Jameson D.M.

At=AR+APRK[TTP73]1+K[TTP73](Eq. 2) Here K represents the equilibrium association constant, and AR and APR represent the intrinsic anisotropy values of the free and protein-associated Fl-RNA substrates, respectively. AR was measured as the anisotropy of each RNA substrate in the absence of TTP73 (n ≥ 3), whereas all other constants were solved by nonlinear least squares regression of At versus [TTP73] using PRISM version 3.0 (GraphPad, San Diego). To measure RNA·peptide complex dissociation rates, binding reactions containing TTP73 and Fl-RNA substrates were assembled as described above with anisotropy measured at equilibrium (t = 0). Following addition of a 5000-fold excess of unlabeled RNA, anisotropy was measured in intervals of 15 s, with five measurements taken for each time point. Thermodynamic Analyses of Peptide:RNA Binding Equilibria—Enthalpic (ΔH0) and entropic (TΔS0) contributions to the free energy of TTP73 binding to RNA substrates were estimated from the temperature dependence of equilibrium binding constants by van't Hoff plots of ln(K) versus 1/T. This plot is linear when ΔH0 is independent of temperature (27Hall K.B. Kranz J.K. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 259: 261-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 28Ha J.-H. Spolar R.S.

Spolar R.S. Record Jr., M.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 801-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). ln(K)=(ΔCP,obs0/R)((TH/T)−ln(TS/T)−1) (Eq. 4) Solution of (ΔCP,obs0), TH, and TS then allowed the contributions of enthalpy and entropy to the energy of peptide·RNA complex formation to be calculated as a function of temperature using Equations 5 and 6, respectively (28Ha J.-H.

FRET efficiency (EFRET) is dependent on the scalar distance (r) between the donor and acceptor by Equation 7. EFRET=R06/(R06+r6) (Eq. 7) R0 is the Förster distance for the donor-acceptor pair or the scalar distance yielding FRET efficiency of 50% (29Clegg R.M.

Methods Enzymol. 1992; 211: 353-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 30Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic/Plenum, New York1999: 367-394Crossref Google Scholar). For the Fl-ARE-AU3A-Cy5 RNA substrate, κ2 was assumed to be 2/3, consistent with random orientation of donor and acceptor, because Fl and Cy5 were conjugated to the RNA moiety using 6- and 3-carbon linkers, respectively. Further support for this approximation is given by the very low anisotropy of fluorescein emission (AR = 0.022 ± 0.002) of the Fl-ARE-AU3A substrate at 25 °C. Because all fluorescence measurements were performed in dilute aqueous solution, n was set to 1.333. QD was measured as 0.40 using the Fl-ARE-AU3A substrate as described (31Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic/Plenum, New York1999: 52-53Google Scholar), with 3-aminofluoranthene in Me2SO (Q = 0.32 at 25 °C) as a reference standard (32Gryczynski I. Kusba J. Lakowicz J.R. J. Fluoresc. 1997; 7: 167-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The overlap integral J(λ) was calculated from the fluorescence emission spectrum of Fl (FD(λ)) and the absorbance spectrum of Cy5 (ϵA(λ)) using Equation 9 (data not shown). J(λ)=∫FD(λ)εA(λ)λ4dλ∫FD(λ)dλ (Eq. 9) From these data, J(λ) resolved to 1.49 × 1015m–1·cm–1·nm4, yielding R0 of 47 Å. Fluorescence emission spectra were measured using a Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer (Varian Instruments, Walnut Creek, CA) with a Peltier temperature control cell (λex = 485 nm, 10 nm bandwidth) at 25 °C. EFRET values were calculated from paired measurements of blank-corrected donor emission (518 nm) using RNA substrates containing either the FRET donor alone (Fl-ARE-AU3A; FD) or the donor-acceptor pair (Fl-ARE-AU3A-Cy5; FDA) by Equation 10 (30Lakowicz J.R.

EFRET=1−(FDA/FD) (Eq. 10) The Zinc Finger Domain of TTP Forms a Dynamic, Equimolar Complex with the ARE13 Substrate—Previously we demonstrated that TTP73 could bind a 20-nucleotide fragment of the ARE from TNFα mRNA with high affinity (20Blackshear P.J.

Whereas this equilibrium was largely consistent with 1:1 stoichiometry of peptide:RNA, a minor but detectable complex consistent with two protein binding events was detected at peptide concentrations above 5 nm. However, we and others (17Park-Lee S. Kim S. Laird-Offringa I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39801-39808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) have detected interactions between the TTP zinc finger domain and RNA substrates as small as 9–13 nucleotides. Accordingly, this study focused on the recognition of small (≤13 nucleotides) RNA ligands by TTP73, to minimize the potential for multiple peptide binding events. The RNA substrate ARE13 encodes a sequence contained within the TNFα ARE. By GMSA, TTP73 formed a single RNA·peptide complex with the radiolabeled ARE13 ligand in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). Binding was absolutely dependent on the presence of Zn2+, verifying that zinc finger-independent mechanisms did not make significant contributions to RNA binding activity in this system. Also, RNA binding activity was dependent on the ARE sequence, because TTP73 did not form detectable complexes with the unrelated Rβ RNA substrate. Using the fluorescence anisotropy assay, TTP73 peptide binding to a fluorescein-labeled ARE13 substrate (Fl-ARE13) was well resolved by the binary equilibrium binding model (Equation 2), indicated by a strong coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.9901) and random distribution of residuals about the regression solution. For assembly of the TTP73·Fl-ARE13 complex, the bimolecular association constant, K, resolves to 2.8 ± 0.5 × 108m–1 (mean ± σn–1, n = 4), yielding a dissociation constant (Kd = 1/K) of 3.6 nm. Consistent with the GMSA experiments (Fig. 1B), TTP73 binding to the Fl-ARE13 substrate was absolutely dependent on Zn2+, because no RNA binding activity was detected in reactions lacking the cation (Fig. 2B). Interaction between TTP73 and this RNA substrate was also relatively dynamic in solution, with off-rate analyses yielding an apparent first-order dissociation constant (koff) of 3.2 ± 0.4 × 10–2 s–1 at 25 °C (regression solution ± 95% confidence interval), corresponding to a complex half-life of 22 s in solution (Fig. 3).Fig. 3Off-rate analysis of TTP73·Fl-ARE13 complexes. TTP73·Fl-ARE13 complexes were prepared by incubation of TTP73 peptide (20 nm) with Fl-ARE13 substrate (0.2 nm). At equilibrium, the fluorescence anisotropy of the mixture was measured (t = 0). Following addition of a 5000-fold excess of unlabeled ARE13 substrate, anisotropy measurements were taken as a function of time (solid circles), with each point representing the mean ± σn–1 of three independent reactions. Data were analyzed by nonlinear regression using a first-order exponential decay function (solid line). Specificity is shown using a 5000-fold excess of unlabeled Rβ substrate as competitor, which was unable to displace the Fl-ARE13 ligand (open circles).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Contribution of Ionic Interactions to Stability of the TTP73·Fl-ARE13 Complex—Because of the polyanionic nature of RNA ligands, association with RNA-binding proteins often includes significant contributions from ionic interactions (34Frankel A.D.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12121-12132Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Several features of TTP73 suggested that ion pairs might play a significant role in stabilizing its association with AU-rich RNA substrates. (i) The TTP73 peptide has a predicted isoelectric point of 9.34 and is expected to exhibit a net charge of +5 at pH 8. (ii) Coordination of two Zn2+ ions contributes additional positive charge to the peptide. (iii) Several amino acid residues with basic side chains are located within each zinc finger motif. (iv) NMR structural analysis of an ARE·peptide complex containing the zinc finger domain of a TTP-related peptide, TIS11d, shows four basic amino acid side chains in close proximity to the RNA phosphodiester backbone (36Hudson B.D. Martinez-Yamout M.A. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Nature Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). These basic residues are conserved in the zinc finger domain of TTP. To evaluate the net influence of ion pairs on the stability of TTP73·Fl-ARE13 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes, equilibrium binding constants were measured under conditions of increasing ionic strength by varying the concentration of KCl from 50 to 500 mm, and plotted as log(K) versus –log[K+] (Fig. 4). The slope of this plot is influenced by the number ion pairs formed during RNA·protein complex assembly (37Draper D.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 593-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The salt dependence of TTP73·Fl-ARE13 RNP formation yielded –∂log(K)/∂log[K+] = 1.1 ± 0.2 (regression solution ±95% confidence interval). This value is similar to RNP complexes containing the trp RNA-binding attenuation protein (38Baumann C. Otridge J. Gollnick P. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1995; 64: 593-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) bound to cognate RNA substrates (–∂log(K)/∂log[K+] >3). The modest value of this parameter indicates that ionic interactions make significant but relatively minor contributions to the stability of the TTP73·Fl-ARE13 RNP, confirming that nonelectrostatic mechanisms, possibly including base-specific contacts or stacking interactions, are critical for assembly of this RNA·protein complex.

https://openalex.org/W2082944610,"Mammalian genomes contain two main classes of retrotransposons, the well-characterized long and short interspersed nuclear elements, which account for ∼30% of the genome, and the long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons, which resemble the proviral integrated form of retroviruses, except for the absence of an envelope gene in some cases. Genetic studies confirmed mobility of the latter class of elements in mice, with a high proportion of phenotypic mutations consequent to transposition of the intracisternal A particle (IAP) family of LTR retrotransposons1. Using the mouse genome sequence and an efficient ex vivo retrotransposition assay, we identified functional, master IAP copies that encode all the enzymatic and structural proteins necessary for their autonomous transposition in heterologous cells. By introducing mutations, we found that the three genes gag, prt and pol are all required for retrotransposition and identified the IAP gene products by electron microscopy in the form of intracellular A-type particles in the transfected cells. These prototypic elements, devoid of an envelope gene, are the first LTR retrotransposons autonomous for transposition to be identified in mammals. Their high rates of retrotransposition indicate that they are potent insertional mutagens that could serve as safe (noninfectious) genetic tools in a large panel of cells."

In this study, we purified the base and lid subcomplexes of the 26 S proteasome from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and we found that the respective subcomplexes have additional small molecular mass subunits. Rpn13 was identified as an additional subunit of the base, whereas Sem1 was identified as an additional subunit of the lid. Rpn13 has been reported to be one of the RP subunits (8Verma R. Chen S. Feldman R. Schieltz D. Yates J. Dohmen J. Deshaies R.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3425-3439Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Sem1 was originally identified as a suppressor of the sec15-1 temperature-sensitive mutation and a negative regulator of pseudohyphal differentiation (25Jantti J. Lahdenranta J. Olkkonen V.M. Soderlund H. Keranen S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 909-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We have obtained several lines of evidence that indicate that Sem1 is a novel lid subunit of the 26 S proteasome and is necessary for enzymatic activity of the 26 S proteasome. First, the recombinant Sem1 is capable of binding with the 26 S proteasome purified from a mutant with deletion of SEM1 (Δsem1) but not with that from the wild type in vitro. Second, the purified 26 S proteasome from the Δsem1 strain seems to be structurally equivalent to the wild type 26 S proteasome, but the 26 S proteasome and the lid from Δsem1 became unstable under high salt conditions. Third, the 19 S RP can be immunoprecipitated with Sem1 as bait. Fourth, the Δsem1 strain shows a temperature-sensitive phenotype, and polyubiquitinated proteins were accumulated in this mutant at the restrictive temperature. Fifth, there was little degradation of polyubiquitinated Sic1 by the 26 S proteasome from the Δsem1 strain in vitro. Finally, genetic interaction between RPN10 and SEM1 genes was observed. The human DSS1 (hDSS1) gene, a homologue of SEM1, is a candidate gene responsible for an autosomal dominant form of split hand/split foot malformation (SHFM) disorder (26Crackower M.A. Scherer S.W. Rommens J.M. Hui C.C. Poorkaj P. Soder S. Cobben J.M. Hudgins L. Evans J.P. Tsui L.C. Hum. Mol.

Richards W.J. Hughes D. Bertwistle D. Marshall C.J. Ashworth A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4633-4642Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that hDSS1 complements the phenotype of the S. cerevisiae Δsem1 mutant and that hDSS1 is capable of interacting with the human 26 S proteasome in mammalian cells, suggesting that hDSS1 is functionally conserved among eukaryotes. Thus, these biochemical and genetic findings suggest that Sem1p is a component of the 26 S proteasome and functions in ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis. Yeast Strains, Media, and Genetic Methods—The S. cerevisiae strains used in this study are listed in Table I. All strains are isogenic to W303. The Escherichia coli strain DH5α was used as a host for propagation and construction of plasmids. E. coli strain Rosetta (DE3) cells (Novagen) were used for expression of GST fusion proteins. Synthetic media (SD) were prepared as described previously (28Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2543) Google Scholar). Synthetic media lacking appropriate nutrient(s) were used to select strains containing specific plasmids. Yeast nutrient-rich medium (YPD) consisted of 2% glucose, 2% polypeptone, 1% yeast extract (Difco), 400 μg/ml adenine, and 20 μg/ml uracil. Transformation of yeast was carried out by the method described by Schiestl and Gietz (29Schiestl R.H. Gietz R.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1773) Google Scholar). For selection of G418 (Invitrogen) resistance, YPD plates containing 200 μg/ml G418 were used. The permissive and restrictive temperatures for temperature-sensitive mutants were 25 and 37 °C, respectively. The Δrpn10 strain (YYS80) was created by one-step disruption by PCR using a KanMX6 module by selection of geneticin resistance (30Wach A. Brachat A. Pohlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2237) Google Scholar). To obtain Δsem1 mutants (YTS63), we first constructed the TSp361 plasmid as follows. An ∼500-bp upstream fragment (EcoRI-XhoI) and a 500-bp downstream fragment (BglII-EcoRI) of the SEM1 ORF were amplified by PCR and cloned into the BamHI-XhoI gap of pRS306 to generate TSp361. TSp361 was linearized by digesting with EcoRI and used as a donor to transform W303-1A. The correct disruption was verified by PCR.Table IYeast strains and plasmids used in this workStrainGenotypeSourceW303-1AMATa leu2 his3 trp1 ura3 ade2 can1Our stockYYS37MATa pre1::PRE13FLAG-HIS3This studyYYS39MATa rpn1::RPN13FLAG-HIS3This studyYYS40MATa rpn11::RPN113FLAG-HIS3This studyYYS80MATa Δrpn10::kanrThis studyYYS98MATa Δrpn10::kanr rpn1::RPN13FLAG-HIS3This studyYYS99MATa Δrpn10::kanr rpn11::RPN113FLAG-HIS3This studyYYS143MATa rpt6::RPT65HA-TRP1This studyYTS63MATa Δsem1::URA3This studyYTS67MATa Δsem1::URA3 rpn11::RPN113FLAG-HIS3This studyYTS68MATa Δsem1::URA3 Δrpn10::kanrThis studyPlasmidCharacteristicsSourcepKT10PTDH3, 2 μm, oriOur stockpRS303HIS3Our stockpRS304TRP1Our stockpRS306URA3Our stockpRS314ARS-CEN, TRP1Our stockpTS901CTARS-CEN, TRP1, 5× HA epitope31Sasaki T.

First, the sequences encoding the PreScission protease site, 3× FLAG epitope (3FLAG) (Sigma), and the transcriptional terminator from the CYC1 gene were amplified and fused by sequential PCR (PFT cassette). Next, the 3′-segment of the ORF of the PRE1, RPT1, or RPN11 gene (without the stop codon) was fused in-frame to the PFT cassette by PCR and cloned into the YIp plasmid pRS303. To obtain the RPT65HA strain, the plasmid was constructed as follows. First, the sequences encoding five tandem repeats of the influenza virus hemagglutinin epitope (5HA) and the transcriptional terminator from the TDH3 gene were amplified and fused by sequential PCR (HT cassette). Next, the 3′-segment of the ORF of the RPT6 gene was fused in-frame to the HT cassette by PCR and cloned into the YIp plasmid pRS304. The resultant plasmid was then linearized by digestion with an appropriate restriction enzyme at a site within the coding sequence of the yeast gene and targeted into the genome. Construction of Plasmids—The ORF of SEM1 containing the EcoRI and XhoI sites was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA of W303-1A and cloned into the pGEM-T plasmid (Promega). The ORFs of human DSS1 (hDSS1) and POH1 (hRPN11) containing the EcoRI and XhoI sites were amplified by PCR from a two-hybrid library of human HeLa cDNA (Clontech Laboratories) and cloned into the pGEM-T plasmid. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. To construct YCp-SEM13HA, the SEM1 gene with its promoter region, 518 bp upstream, was amplified by PCR and cloned into the pGEM-T plasmid, and the 786-bp fragment that had been produced from the above plasmid by digestion with PstI and XhoI was inserted into the PstI and XhoI sites of the pTS901CT plasmid (YCp, TRP1, 5× HA epitope) (31Sasaki T. Toh E.-A. Kikuchi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7971-7979Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). For suppression analysis, the SEM1 gene with its own promoter region (upstream of 518 bp) and terminator region (downstream of 540 bp) was amplified by PCR and subcloned into the low copy plasmid pRS314. The hDSS1 gene was subcloned into the pKT10 plasmid, and the fragment containing the DSS1 gene flanked by 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of the TDH3 gene was subcloned into pRS314. For expressing GST fusion proteins, the SEM1 fragment that had been digested with EcoRI and XhoI was subcloned into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of the pGEX6P1 plasmid (Amersham Biosciences) and transformed into E. coli strain Rosetta (DE3) (Novagen). To generate the mammalian expression plasmids, the respective fragments of hDSS1 and POH1 were inserted into the EcoRI and SalI sites of the mammalian expression plasmid pCI-neo-3FLAG that had been generated by inserting the oligonucleotides encoding 3FLAG into the SalI and NotI sites of the pCI-neo plasmid (Promega). Affinity Purification of the 26 S Proteasome and Its Subcomplexes—The 26 S proteasome was isolated by a modification of the method described by Verma et al. (8Verma R. Chen S. Feldman R. Schieltz D. Yates J. Dohmen J. Deshaies R.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3425-3439Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). The respective tagged and untagged strains of S. cerevisiae were grown to an absorbance of 600 nm (A600) at 2.0 in YPD medium at 25 °C. Cells were harvested and washed twice with ice-cold water and once with buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol). The pellet was stored at -80 °C until use. Cells (4 g) were thawed, suspended in 4 ml of buffer B (buffer A containing 4 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, and 2× ATP regeneration system), and lysed by glass beads using a Bead-Beater (Biospec Products). An equal volume of buffer B was added to the lysate, and the mixture was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 2 °C. 80 μl of anti-FLAG M2-agarose beads (Sigma) was added to the recovered supernatant, and the mixture was rotated for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times with 10 ml of buffer C (buffer A containing 2 mm ATP and 5 mm MgCl2), twice with 10 ml of buffer C containing 0.2% Triton X-100, and again twice with 10 ml of buffer C. The beads were transferred to a 2-ml disposable column (Bio-Rad) and incubated with 100 μl of 3× FLAG peptide (100 μg/ml) (Sigma) in buffer C for 30 min at 4 °C to elute the 26 S proteasome. The purified 26 S proteasome was stored at -80 °C. The base, lid, and CP were isolated using YYS98 (Δrpn10 RPN13FLAG), YYS99 (Δrpn10 RPN113FLAG) and YYS37 (PRE13FLAG) strains, respectively, as follows. Anti-FLAG M2 beads, to which the 26 S proteasome from each of the above strains had been bound, were incubated with buffer D (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol) for 1 h at 4 °C to dissociate the 26 S proteasome to the lid, base, and CP. The beads were then washed four times with 10 ml of buffer D, incubated with buffer D containing 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min at 25 °C, and washed twice with the same buffer and twice with buffer A. The base, lid, or CP, bound to the beads, was then eluted with 3× FLAG peptide as described above. SDS-PAGE and Peptide Sequence Analysis—The isolated base and lid were resolved by 12.5% SDS-PAGE, and protein bands were excised from the SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gels containing the respective protein bands were destained with 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate containing 50% acetonitrile and were completely dehydrated by evaporation using a SpeedVac vacuum centrifuge. After rehydration by adding a gel volume of 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, containing 10 ng/μl Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease (Wako Pure Chemicals) or 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, containing 10 ng/μl Achromobacter lyticus lysyl endopeptidase (Wako) at 4 °C for 30 min, the gels were incubated at 37 °C for 12 h to allow the above proteases to digest the respective proteins. The resultant peptides in the gels were extracted by adding a gel volume of a solution consisting of 50% acetonitrile and 5% trifluoroacetic acid. This extraction procedure was repeated twice. The extracted peptides were then combined, evaporated to about 20 μl in a volume using a SpeedVac vacuum centrifuge, and acidified by addition of trifluoroacetic acid at the final concentration of about 0.1%. Peptide fragments were then separated by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography with a 1–80% acetonitrile gradient in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid on a column (0.46 × 10 cm) of TSK gel Super ODS (Tosoh, Japan). Peptides eluted as peaks were subjected to amino acid sequence determination on Procise 492 cLC (Applied Biosystems). Peptide Mass Fingerprinting—Proteins on the SDS-PAGE gel were excised, destained as described above, and digested in gels with 10 μg/ml modified trypsin (Promega) in 15 μl of 20 mm ammonium bicarbonate. The resulting peptides were desalted using ZipTip-Cμ18 (Millipore) and mixed with 3 mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Sigma) in 0.3% trifluoroacetic acid and 50% acetonitrile. The peptide mass fingerprints of proteins were obtained by a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time of flight MS on Voyager DE-PRO (Applied Biosystems). A data base search was performed using MS-Fit. Nondenaturing PAGE and In-gel Peptidase Assay—Nondenaturing PAGE on 4% polyacrylamide gel and the subsequent in-gel peptidase assay for the proteasome using a fluorogenic substrate, Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-MCA (Peptide Institute, Japan), were carried out as described by Glickman et al. (5Glickman M.H. Rubin D.M. Fried V.A. Finley D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3149-3162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gels were run in a cold room until the dye (xylene cyanol) had run off. The gels were then incubated with the substrate for 10 min at 30 °C in the presence of ATP and 0.05% SDS in buffer A for detection of the 26 S proteasome and the 20 S proteasome, respectively (5Glickman M.H. Rubin D.M. Fried V.A. Finley D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3149-3162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The signals due to the proteasomes were visualized and photographed upon exposure to a UV transilluminator (360 nm). Western Blotting—Proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to a poly(vinylidene difluoride) membrane, and blotted with the following antibodies: rabbit anti-ubiquitin serum (Sigma), mouse anti-polyubiquitin antibody (FK2) (32Fujimuro M. Sawada H. Yokosawa H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), rabbit anti-actin antibody (Biomedical Technologies), mouse anti-HA antibody (12CA5, Roche Applied Science), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated mouse anti-T7 antibody (Novagen), mouse anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma), rabbit anti-20 S antibody (7Saeki Y. Toh-e A. Yokosawa H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 509-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), rabbit anti-Rpn9 antibody (33Takeuchi J. Fujimuro M. Yokosawa H. Tanaka K. Toh-e A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6575-6584Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), rabbit anti-Rpt5, rabbit anti-MSS1 (hRpt1), rabbit anti-p45 (hRpt6), and mouse anti-ζ (hα5) antibodies (Affiniti Research Products Ltd.). Except for the cases with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated mouse anti-T7 antibody, the blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) and visualized with ECL immunoblotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Signals were detected by using x-ray film (Fuji) or an LAS3000 system (Fuji). Binding of GST-Sem1 with the 26 S Proteasome—GST or GST fusion protein was expressed and isolated from Rosetta (DE3) cells transformed with pGEX6P1 or pGEX6P1 containing the respective gene as described previously (13Saeki Y. Sone T. Toh-e A. Yokosawa H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 296: 813-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). GST-Sem1 or GST (1 μg each) was diluted in 0.5 ml of binding buffer (buffer A containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 5% non-fat milk) and was then incubated with 10 μl of glutathione-immobilized agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at room temperature to allow GST-Sem1 or GST to bind to the beads. After washing with binding buffer, the beads were suspended in 200 μl of binding buffer containing 2 mm ATP and 5 mm MgCl2. The affinity-purified 26 S proteasome from the wild type or Δsem1 strain (2 μg each) was added to the beads, and the mixture was incubated for 30 min at room temperature. After the beads had been washed five times with 500 μl of the same buffer, the proteins retained in the beads were eluted with SDS-loading buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting with anti-Rpt5, anti-Rpn9, and anti-20 S proteasome antibodies. Immunoprecipitation with Anti-HA Antibody-immobilized Beads—The S. cerevisiae strains were grown to an A600 at 1.0 in SD-Trp media at 30 °C. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation and washed with buffer A. The pellet was suspended in 1 ml of buffer A and lysed by glass beads. An equal volume of buffer A was added to the lysate, and the suspension was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 2 °C. 25 μl of anti-HA affinity matrix (Roche Applied Science) was added to the supernatant, and the mixture was rotated for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times with buffer A, and the bound proteins were then eluted with 40 μl of 0.1 m glycine-HCl, pH 3.0, and immediately neutralized by addition of 1.5 μl of 1.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.8. Accumulation of Polyubiquitinated Proteins—The wild type and mutant strains of S. cerevisiae were cultured in YPD medium at 25 °C to the logarithmic phase and then cultured at 37 °C. Cells corresponding to an A600 at 1.0 unit were periodically harvested and lysed by the mild alkali method (34Kushnirov V.V. Yeast. 2000; 16: 857-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). The extract was subjected to SDS-PAGE and then to Western blotting with an FK2 antibody that specially recognizes polyubiquitin chains (32Fujimuro M. Sawada H. Yokosawa H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) and also with an anti-actin antibody (Sigma) as a control. Preparation of Polyubiquitinated Cdc34 and Gel Shift Assay for Its Binding with the 26 S Proteasome—Polyubiquitinated Cdc34 was produced using Cdc34/Ubc3 (E2) and Uba1 (E1). (The details of isolation procedures of Cdc34 and Uba1 will be published elsewhere.) A reaction mixture consisting of 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm ATP, 2.5 μg/μl ubiquitin (Sigma), 40 ng/μl Uba1, and 200 ng/μl Cdc34 was incubated for 12 h at 37 °C. The level of polyubiquitination was estimated by Western blotting with an FK2 antibody. The resultant polyubiquitinated Cdc34 in the indicated amount was mixed with 3 pmol of the affinity-purified 26 S proteasomes in a final volume of 4 μl, and the mixture was incubated for 15 min at room temperature and then subjected to nondenaturing PAGE, followed by in-gel peptidase assay for the proteasome. Preparation of Polyubiquitinated Sic1PY and in Vitro Degradation Assay—To prepare polyubiquitinated Sic1PY, we developed a novel method using Rsp5 as an E3 ligase. (The details of this method will be published elsewhere.) In brief, the PY motif was introduced into the N-terminal region of Sic1, designated as Sic1PY, to allow Rsp5 to bind to Sic1. The resultant Sic1PY and the original Sic1 were expressed as fusion proteins with T7 tags at the N termini and HAT tags (Clontech) at the C termini, designated as T7-Sic1PY-HAT and T7-Sic1-HAT, respectively, constructed by the pET system (Novagen). T7-Sic1PY-HAT and T7-Sic1-HAT proteins were purified according to the method described by Verma et al. (23Verma R. Aravind L. Oania R. McDonald W.H. Yates III, J.R. Koonin E.V. Deshaies R.J. Science. 2002; 298: 611-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar) and were then incubated with Uba1 (E1), Ubc4 (E2), and Rsp5 (E3). (The details of isolation procedures of Ubc4 and Rsp5 will be published elsewhere.) The resultant polyubiquitinated Sic1PY (400 nm) was incubated with the affinity-purified 26 S proteasome (200 nm) from the wild type or Δsem1 strain at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of SDS-loading buffer, and the reaction mixture was then subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting with an anti-T7 antibody to detect the degree of degradation.

https://openalex.org/W2154210637,"Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria, relies extensively on glycolysis coupled with homolactic fermentation during its blood-borne stages for energy production. Selective inhibitors of the parasite lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), central to NAD+ regeneration, therefore potentially provide a route to new antimalarial drugs directed against a novel molecular target. A series of heterocyclic, azole-based compounds are described that preferentially inhibit P. falciparum LDH at sub-micromolar concentrations, typically at concentrations about 100-fold lower than required for human lactate dehydrogenase inhibition. Crystal structures show these competitive inhibitors form a network of interactions with amino acids within the active site of the enzyme, stacking alongside the nicotinamide ring of the NAD+ cofactor. These compounds display modest activity against parasitized erythrocytes, including parasite strains with known resistance to existing anti-malarials and against Plasmodium berghei in BALB/c mice. Initial toxicity data suggest the azole derivatives have generally low cytotoxicity, and preliminary pharmoco-kinetic data show favorable bioavailability and circulation times. These encouraging results suggest that further enhancement of these structures may yield candidates suitable for consideration as new therapeutics for the treatment of malaria. In combination these studies also provide strong support for the validity of targeting the Plasmodium glycolytic pathway and, in particular, LDH in the search for novel anti-malarials.

In combination these studies also provide strong support for the validity of targeting the Plasmodium glycolytic pathway and, in particular, LDH in the search for novel anti-malarials. Plasmodium parasites are believed to lack a functional Krebs (citric acid) cycle for at least part of their life cycle and hence rely extensively on ATP generation via the anaerobic fermentation of glucose (see Ref. 1Lang-Unnasch N. Murphy A.D. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1998; 52: 561-590Google Scholar for review). The energy requirement of the parasitized erythrocyte is such that utilization of glucose is up to 100 times greater than in nonparasitized erythrocytes (2Scheibel L.W. Adler A. Trager W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 5303-5307Google Scholar, 3Roth Jr., E.F. Raventos-Suarez C. Perkins M. Nagel R.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 109: 355-362Google Scholar), and virtually all glucose can be accounted for by production of lactate (2Scheibel L.W. Adler A. Trager W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 5303-5307Google Scholar). Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), 1The abbreviations used are: LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; pfLDH, Plasmodium falciparum lactate dehydrogenase; hsLDH, human lactate dehydrogenase. the last enzyme in the glycolytic pathway in Plasmodium falciparum, is a 2-hydroxy acid oxidoreductase that converts pyruvate to lactate and simultaneously the conversion of NADH to NAD+. As a constant supply of NADH is a prerequisite for glycolysis, and LDH acts as the primary source in Plasmodium for the regeneration of NADH from NAD+, inhibition of LDH is expected to stop production of ATP, with subsequent P. falciparum cell death. Any compound that blocks the LDH enzyme is a potentially potent antimalarial with a different mode of action to existing drugs. As such, P. falciparum lactate dehydrogenase (pfLDH) has been suggested as a drug target by several authors (4Gomez M.S. Piper R.C. Hunsaker L.A. Royer R.E. Deck L.M. Makler M.T. Vander Jagt D.L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 90: 235-246Google Scholar, 5Menting J.G. Tilley L. Deady L.W. Ng K. Simpson R.J. Cowman A.F. Foley M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 88: 215-224Google Scholar, 6Ridley R.G. Exp. Parasitol. 1997; 87: 293-304Google Scholar). One well recognized difficulty is that the drug must potently inhibit pfLDH yet show much less activity against the three human LDH (hsLDH) isoforms. A comparison of the crystal structures of both P. falciparum and human LDH (7Read J.A. Winter V.J. Eszes C.M. Sessions R.B. Brady R.L. Proteins. 2001; 43: 175-185Google Scholar, 8Dunn C.R. Banfield M.J. Barker J.J. Higham C.W. Moreton K.M. Turgut-Balik D. Brady R.L. Holbrook J.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 912-915Google Scholar) shows the following two key differences: namely positioning of the NADH factor, reflecting sequence changes in the cofactor binding pocket that displace the nicotinamide ring by about 1.2 Å, and a change in the sequence (including a 5-residue insertion) and secondary structure of a loop region that closes down on the active site during catalysis. These changes combine to produce an increase in the volume of the active site cleft in pfLDH relative to its human counterparts. In addition to these structural variations, there are significant kinetic differences between the two enzymes; indeed, by using the NADH derivative 3-acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide, kinetic differences between human and pfLDH are so great that the observed LDH activity can be used as an indication of in vivo parasitemia (9Makler M.T. Ries J.M. Williams J.A. Bancroft J.E. Piper R.C. Gibbins B.L. Hinrichs D.J. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1993; 48: 739-741Google Scholar). Together, the structural and kinetic discrepancies between the mammalian and malarial enzymes suggest that specific and potent pfLDH inhibitors can be designed or identified. Several groups are known to have targeted pfLDH in drug discovery studies. Derivatives of the gossypols have been considered as pfLDH inhibitors. Gossypol is a polyphenolic binaphthyl disesquiterpene found in cottonseed oil, has been shown to inhibit LDHs at sub-micromolar (0.7 μm) levels (10Royer R.E. Deck L.M. Campos N.M. Hunsaker L.A. Vander Jagt D.L. J. Med. Chem. 1986; 29: 1799-1801Google Scholar), is competitive for NADH, and exhibits in vitro anti-malarial activity (4Gomez M.S. Piper R.C. Hunsaker L.A. Royer R.E. Deck L.M. Makler M.T. Vander Jagt D.L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 90: 235-246Google Scholar) with an IC50 of 10 μm. However, gossypol is cytotoxic. Attempts to derivatize gossypol have produced several compounds retaining activity against both the target enzyme and the parasite but without significantly improving selectivity or parasiticidal activity. The synthesis of derivatives of 8-deoxyhemigossylic acid has also been reported (11Deck L.M. Royer R.E. Chamblee B.B. Hernandez V.M. Malone R.R. Torres J.E. Hunsaker L.A. Piper R.C. Makler M.T. Vander Jagt D.L. J. Med. Chem. 1998; 41: 3879-3887Google Scholar). This class of chemicals has been developed in an attempt to reduce the toxicity believed to be associated with the aldehyde group present in gossypol and to increase the specificity of inhibition. The hemigossypols exhibit low micromolar inhibition of LDHs and are competitive for NADH, and some of these compounds are selective inhibitors of pfLDH with respect to human LDH (11Deck L.M. Royer R.E. Chamblee B.B. Hernandez V.M. Malone R.R. Torres J.E. Hunsaker L.A. Piper R.C. Makler M.T. Vander Jagt D.L. J. Med. Chem. 1998; 41: 3879-3887Google Scholar). One such compound, 7-p-trifluoromethylbenzyl-8-deoxyhemigossylic acid, has a reported Ki of 13, 81, and 4 μm, respectively, for human heart, muscle, and sperm LDH (12Yu Y. Deck J.A. Hunsaker L.A. Deck L.M. Royer R.E. Goldberg E. Vander Jagt D.L. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2001; 62: 81-89Google Scholar) and 0.2 μm for pfLDH (4Gomez M.S. Piper R.C. Hunsaker L.A. Royer R.E. Deck L.M. Makler M.T. Vander Jagt D.L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 90: 235-246Google Scholar). Vander Jagt and co-workers have also investigated various N-substituted hydroxamic acid derivatives and reported 35–80 μm activity versus pfLDH (13Dando C. Schroeder E.R. Hunsaker L.A. Deck L.M. Royer R.E. Zhou X. Parmley S.F. Vander Jagt D.L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 118: 23-32Google Scholar) and 0.3–10 mm activity versus human LDH (12Yu Y. Deck J.A. Hunsaker L.A. Deck L.M. Royer R.E. Goldberg E. Vander Jagt D.L. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2001; 62: 81-89Google Scholar). Modifications do not appear to affect potency significantly or the selectivity of these compounds, which appear to be competitive for pyruvate. No parasiticidal activity has been reported for these compounds. In this paper we report the discovery of a new class of compounds that inhibit pfLDH and also display anti-malarial activity. Initially identified in a high throughput enzymatic assay, these compounds have been shown to interact directly and preferentially with pfLDH through x-ray crystallographic and steady-state kinetic analyses. They have been further characterized in parasiticidal whole-cell assays using drug-sensitive and -resistant strains of Plasmodium, and have been demonstrated to have in vivo anti-malarial activity using the Plasmodium berghei rodent model. In combination these results help demonstrate the viability of targeting pfLDH in the development of novel anti-malarials and provide examples of compounds that could be further developed to provide novel therapeutics for targeting the Plasmodium glycolytic pathway. High Throughput Enzymatic Screen—An LDH enzymatic assay developed for high throughput format was used in a high throughput screen. The dehydrogenase reaction was run in the reverse (lactate → pyruvate) direction and coupled with the ability of diaphorase to reduce p-iodonitrotetrazolium violet using the NADH generated in the conversion of lactate to pyruvate (14Allain C.C. Henson C.P. Nadel M.K. Knoblesdorff A.J. Clin. Chem. 1973; 19: 223-227Google Scholar). The progression of the coupling reaction was monitored as the increase of absorbance at 492 nm. In the initial screen, potential inhibition of both pfLDH and human LDH (both expressed as recombinant proteins and purified as described previously (7Read J.A. Winter V.J. Eszes C.M. Sessions R.B.

Proteins. 2001; 43: 175-185Google Scholar)) was monitored at single sample points corresponding to 25 μg/ml of the compound in 5% Me2SO; 0.15 mm NAD+; 1.5 mm lactic acid; 1 mm INT; 18 μg/ml Diaphorase; and 1 μg/ml pfLDH or human LDH. Positive hits were subjected to additional analysis to determine IC50 values. Synthesis of Azole Derivatives—The parent compounds of the isooxazole and oxadiazole families were prepared in multigram scale by simple modification of the methods described in the literature (15Wieland H. Kitasato Z. Utzino S. Liebigs Ann. Chem. 1930; 478: 43-54Google Scholar). A range of azoles was synthesized by the introduction of substituents at the hydroxyl and acid moieties of the parent compounds (positions 3 and 4, respectively, Fig. 1). The replacement of heteroatoms within the ring structure was also considered, and the details of the modifications studied are all included in Tables I,II,III,IV. Synthetic routes for these derivatives are described in the Supplemental Material.Table IActivity of 1,2,5-oxadiazole (OXD) series Open table in a new tab Table II1,2/1,5-Isoxazole (IOA) series Open table in a new tab Table III1,2,5-Thiadiazole (TDA) series Open table in a new tab Table IVTriazole (TRZ) series Open table in a new tab Crystallographic Analysis of Enzyme-Azole Inhibitory Complexes— Crystals of pfLDH and human LDH were grown by using either NADH or NAD+ as cofactor as described in Refs. 8Dunn C.R. Banfield M.J. Barker J.J. Higham C.W. Moreton K.M. Turgut-Balik D. Brady R.L. Holbrook J.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 912-915Google Scholar and 7Read J.A. Winter V.J. Eszes C.M. Sessions R.B. Brady R.L. Proteins. 2001; 43: 175-185Google Scholar, respectively. Ligands were introduced to these crystals dissolved in the crystallization mother liquor substituted with up to 30% Me2SO. Diffraction data were collected at the Daresbury SRS synchrotron (station PX14.1), Hamburg DESY synchrotron (station X11), or using the Nonius® FR591 rotating anode laboratory source (Nonius BV, Netherlands) and processed using the HKL suite of programs (16Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Carter J.C.W. Sweet R.M. Macromolecular Crystallography. 276. Academic Press, New York1997: 307-326Google Scholar). Structures were solved using the phases from the isomorphous structure of the ternary complex of pfLDH (Protein Data Bank accession code 1LDG) or human LDH (Protein Data Bank accession code 1IOZ) and refined using the program REFMAC5 (17Project Collaborative Computational Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Google Scholar). Kinetic Analysis—Although the dehydrogenase reaction was run in the reverse (lactate → pyruvate) direction for the high throughput screen, a more thorough kinetic analysis of selected inhibitors was based on the reaction run in the forward direction and monitored by measuring the change in molar absorbance of NADH at 340 nm as described previously (18Winter V.J. Cameron A. Tranter R. Sessions R.B. Brady R.L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2004; 131: 1-10Google Scholar). For kinetic analysis in the reverse direction, reactions containing 2 mm phenazine ethosulfate, 1 mg/ml p-nitrotetrazolium blue, 1 mm NAD+, and varying concentrations of lactate in PET buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 3% (w/v) PEG 6000) were initiated by the addition of pfLDH to 4.4 nm and monitored by the increase in absorbance at 655 nm at 25 °C. Data were analyzed by using nonlinear least squares regression with the software package DynaFit™ (Biokin Ltd.) (19Kuzmic P. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 237: 260-273Google Scholar). Calculations of kcat depended upon the protein concentration as measured at 280 nm by using an extinction coefficient of 1.16 mg/ml·cm for H4-hsLDH proteins, 1.2 mg/ml·cm for M4-hsLDH (20Barstow D.A. Black G.W. Sharman A.F. Scawen M.D. Atkinson T. Li S.S. Chia W.N. Clarke A.R. Holbrook J.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1087: 73-79Google Scholar), and 0.5 mg/ml·cm for pfLDH. The pKa of the active site histidine was estimated by fitting the variation of KM(obs) with pH to KM(obs) = KM(1 + 10–pK/10–pH) as described previously (7Read J.A. Winter V.J. Eszes C.M. Sessions R.B. Brady R.L. Proteins. 2001; 43: 175-185Google Scholar). In Vitro Anti-plasmodial Activity—The drug-sensitive 3D7 clone of the NF54 isolate (21Ponnudurai T. Leeuwenberg A.D. Meuwissen J.H. Trop. Geogr. Med. 1981; 33: 50-54Google Scholar) and the chloroquine-, pyrimethamine-, and cycloguanil-resistant K1 strain (Thailand) were acquired from MR4 (Malaria Research and Reference Reagent Resource Center, Manassas, VA). P. falciparum in vitro culture was carried out following standard methods (22Trager W. Jensen J.B. Science. 1976; 193: 673-675Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, parasites were maintained in tissue culture flasks in human A Rh+ erythrocytes at 5% hematocrit in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 25 mm HEPES, 24 mm NaHCO3, 0.2% (w/v) glucose, 0.03% l-glutamine, 150 μm hypoxanthine, and 0.5% Albumax II® (Invitrogen) in a 5% CO2, 95% air mixture at 37 °C, and the medium was changed daily. The method used to test drug susceptibility was modified from the protocol described previously (23Desjardins R.E. Canfield C.J. Haynes J.D. Chulay J.D. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1979; 16: 710-718Google Scholar). Briefly, stock drug solutions were dissolved in 100% Me2SO in glass bottles, and serial dilutions of the drugs were prepared in assay medium (RPMI 1640 supplemented with 0.5% Albumax II® (Invitrogen), 0.2% w/v glucose, 0.03% l-glutamine, and 15 μm hypoxanthine), in triplicate, in 96-well plates. This was followed by the addition of 50 μl of asynchronous (65–75% ring stage) P. falciparum culture (0.5% parasitemia) or uninfected erythrocytes at 5% hematocrit to each well in assay medium. Plates were incubated at 37 °C, in 5% CO2, 95% air mixture for 24 h, followed by the addition of 20 μl (0.1 μCi/well) of [3H]hypoxanthine to each well. Plates were mixed for 1 min using a plate shaker and returned to the incubator. After an additional 24-h incubation period, the experiment was terminated by placing the plates in a –80 °C freezer. Plates were thawed and harvested onto glass fiber filter mats using a cell harvester (Tomtec) and dried. After the addition of Meltilex® solid scintillant (Wallac), the incorporated radioactivity was counted using a Wallac® 1450 Betalux scintillation counter (Wallac). All assays included chloroquine diphosphate as a standard and control wells with untreated infected and uninfected erythrocytes. Data acquired by the Wallac® BetaLux scintillation counter were exported into a MICROSOFT® EXCEL spread-sheet (Microsoft Corp.), and the IC50/IC90 values of each drug were calculated by using XLFit® (ID Business Solutions Ltd., UK) line fitting software. In Vivo Antimalarial Activity—A preliminary experiment was undertaken at a single dose to evaluate the activity of two leading compounds from the heterocyclic series. Compounds OXD1 and IOA1 (see Tables I,II,III,IV for structures) were tested in the P. berghei model by using the 4-day suppressive test, as indicated by Peters (24Peters W. Ann. Trop. Med. Parasitol. 1975; 69: 155-171Google Scholar), and using chloroquine as a positive control. Briefly, naive 18–20-g BALB/C mice were infected intravenously with 2 × 106 parasitized red cells on day +0. For administration, compounds were freshly prepared in 10% Me2SO in sterile phosphate-buffered saline the day of use. Two hours post-infection mice received the first treatment by the intraperitoneal route. Mice were further treated on days +1–3. Blood films from tail blood were prepared on day +4, and parasitemia was determined by microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained blood films. A further experiment was carried out to determine oral bioavailability and the ED50 value of the compounds in an in vivo dose-response experiment. Compounds OXD1, IOA1, and TDA1 were tested at 100, 50, 25, and 12.5 mg/kg/day by the intraperitoneal route and at 100 mg/kg/day by the oral route. Chloroquine was used as a positive control at 10 mg/kg/day by the intraperitoneal route. Mice were treated and levels of parasitemia determined as described for the single dose experiment. Pharmacokinetic Studies—A preliminary study to assess the plasma levels of OXD1 and IOA1 was performed by intraperitoneal or oral administration of each compound to mice inoculated 2 h earlier with 1 × 107 P. berghei parasitized erythrocytes. Plasma samples were collected from three mice at each time point: 30-, 90-, and 180-min post-compound administration. Plasma concentrations of OXD1 and IOA1 were determined by peak integration after separation by using standard liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis techniques. In Vitro Cytotoxicity Assays—Cytotoxicity of OXD1 against mammalian cells was assessed by standard methods (25Palomino J.C. Portaels F. Eur. J. Clin. Microbiol. Infect. Dis. 1999; 18: 380-383Google Scholar). Sterile 96-well microtiter plates were seeded with 100 μl of KB cells at 4 × 104/ml in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (complete medium). Plates were incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2, 95% air mixture for 24 h. Compounds were dissolved in 100% Me2SO at 20 mg/ml. For the assays, serial dilutions of the compounds were prepared in triplicate using complete medium. Culture supernatants were removed and replaced by the serial dilutions at 300, 30, 3, and 0.3 μg/ml. The positive control drug was podophyllotoxin (Sigma). Plates were incubated for a further 72 h followed by the addition of 10 μl of Alamar-Blue® (AccuMed International Inc.) to each well and incubation for 2–4 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2, 95% air mixture before reading fluorescence emission at 585 nm after excitation at 530 nm in a SPECTRAMAX® GEM-INI plate reader (Molecular Devices Inc). ED50 values were calculated using XLFit® (ID Business Solutions Ltd., UK) line fitting software. High Throughput Enzymatic Screen—Screening of over 500,000 compounds primarily from the Glaxo Wellcome proprietary chemical collection identified a number of chemical families of interest that had a pfLDH IC50 between 0.05–0.01 μg/ml and a selectivity ratio pfLDH/hsLDH IC50 >10. One of these families consisted of compounds that will be collectively referred to as the azoles (Fig. 1). All three parent compounds had a consistent substitution pattern with a hydroxy function and a carboxyl moiety in adjacent positions (3,4-di-substitution). Synthesis and Activity of Azole Derivatives—A series of compounds was synthesized with the aim of exploring the structure activity relationships of the parent azoles. As shown in Tables I,II,III,IV, we tested examples of derivatives at all five positions of the pentacyclic ring, as well as heterocyclic variations within the ring structure itself. In summary, modifications to or substitution of the C-3 hydroxyl and C-4 carboxyl groups resulted in the loss of at least 2 orders of magnitude of activity against pfLDH, and none of the ethers, esters, or bioisosters of the hydroxyl or acid moieties were active. Modifying the heterocyclic nature of the ring by substituting the oxygen at position 1 with sulfur (resulting in the thiadiazole family, see Table III) increased the potency slightly but also led to a slight reduction in specificity. Substitution at the same position with nitrogen (leading to the triazoles, see Table IV) was nonproductive. The rationale for the wide variations in potency when modifying position 1 could be rationalized as arising from either steric hindrance (as the presence of nitrogen in position 1 introduces an extra substituent in the ring) or electronic effects (as the presence of the nitrogen modifies the pKa of the hydroxyl group). As will be shown later, the acidity of the 2-hydroxyl group is a key factor that determines the types of interactions established by the substrate into the active site. Activity is retained if the ring nitrogens at positions 2 and 5 are substituted with carbon to produce the isooxazoles (Table II), but substitution at position 2 is less well tolerated. Despite this, the introduction of methyl groups at either of these positions reduces activity to greater than 100 μm. Crystallographic Analysis of Enzyme-Azole Inhibitory Complexes—A summary of the diffraction data and refinement statistics for complexes of pfLDH with OXD1, TDA1, and IOA1 and human LDH with OXD1 is shown in Table V.Table VData collection and refinement statistics Open table in a new tab The hydroxy acid heterocyclic azole OXD1 binds in the active site of both human and plasmodial LDH, alongside the NAD+ cofactor (Fig. 2, a and b). The carboxyl acid group of the inhibitor forms salt bridges with Arg-171 and Arg-109 of the active site loop, mimicking the interactions of the pyruvate substrate (8Dunn C.R. Banfield M.J. Barker J.J. Higham C.W. Moreton K.M. Turgut-Balik D. Brady R.L. Holbrook J.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 912-915Google Scholar). The hydroxyl group of the oxadiazole contributes to a hydrogen bond network with the side chains of residues Asn-140, His-195, and Arg-109. In both the human and plasmodial crystal structures, the heterocyclic ring of the inhibitor is stacked parallel to the nicotinamide ring of the NAD+ cofactor, whereas the nitrogen in position 2 of the heterocyclic ring is within Van der Waals radii of the NAD+ and the side chain amine of Asn-140. In the plasmodial structure, the side of the heterocyclic ring harboring the carboxyl group is in close proximity to Pro-246 (threonine in hsLDH), and the Oγ of Ser-245 forms hydrogen bonds with both the ring oxygen of the inhibitor and the cofactor (via a bound water molecule). In the human LDH structure, the ring oxygen of the inhibitor is hydrogen-bonded to a water molecule, but this water appears to make no contacts with the protein itself. The closely related inhibitors TDA1 (Table III) and IOA1 (Table II) bind in a manner virtually identical to that of OXD1, although there is small offset of <1 Å in the ring position when measured at position 1 (Fig. 3). Apart from this offset, all other features of the complex, including the surrounding protein residues, are essentially identical to those seen in the pfLDH: OXD1 structure. In all three complexes, the oxygen or sulfur at position 1 forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain of Ser-245. This interaction is absent in the crystal structure of OXD1 bound to human LDH, where the equivalent residue is a tyrosine but projects away from the bound inhibitor. Ser-245 and Pro-246 adopt different conformations when neither substrate nor inhibitor is bound, as seen in the crystal structure of the binary complex (Fig. 4). The adjacent “active site loop” is also disordered in this binary complex as is commonly observed for this class of oxidoreductase enzymes.Fig. 4Movement of Ser-245/Pro-246 between binary and ternary complexes of pfLDH. Figure shows a stereoview of the crystal structure of the pfLDH-NADH binary complex (blue carbons) overlaid on the pfLDH-NAD+-oxalate ternary complex (green carbons except NADH carbons which are shown in magenta). Note that Arg-109 and the water molecule are both disordered in the binary structure, a consequence of the active site loop (residues 102–109) not being ordered in the absence of substrate. The arrow indicates the direction of movement of the Ser-245/Pro-246 during the transition from the binary to the ternary structure. Distances of key contacts are given in angstroms for the ternary structure.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Kinetic Analysis—We used steady-state kinetics to examine the mode of binding of the azole inhibitor family. All active azoles exhibited mixed inhibition against both NADH and pyruvate and competitive inhibition against lactate (Fig. 5). Kinetically, LDH behaves as a sequential ordered bi-bi enzyme with the cofactor binding prior to substrate and being released after the product. The azoles hence bind preferentially to the enzyme-NAD+ complex, mimicking the nonspecific inhibitor oxalate (26Novoa W.B. Winer A.D. Glaid A.J. Schwert G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 1143-1148Google Scholar). The measured inhibitory constants (Ki) were 210 nm for OXD1, 470 nm for IOA1, and 290 nm for TDA1. PfLDH Ser-245 → Ala Mutant—Crystal structures of the azoles bound to pfLDH suggested the hydrogen bond formed between the oxygen or sulfur in position 1 of the azole, and the Oγ of Ser-245 was likely to be a major determinant of selectivity for the malarial form of the enzyme. To test this hypothesis, we used site-directed mutagenesis to change the side chain at position 245 to alanine. Co-crystallization of the pfLDH Ser-245 → Ala mutant with oxamate (a substrate analogue) and NADH shows that the active site loop occupies the “closed” position previously seen in the wild type ternary complex, but the Ala-245 to Pro-246 region is in the “open” conformation normally seen in the binary (enzyme-cofactor) complex (Fig. 6). In the structure of the wild type enzyme co-crystallized with NADH and oxamate, the Oγ of Ser-245 forms a hydrogen bond with a water molecule that is in turn bonded to the cofactor ribose group. This water molecule is not present in the crystal structure of the mutant. The inability of the alanine side chain in the mutant to interact with the ribose group appears to correlate with the Ala-245 to Pro-246 region remaining in the open conformation, in turn probably explaining the reduced activity of this mutant enzyme (Table VI). The critical interaction formed between the serine in wild type pfLDH and the azole inhibitors raises the possibility that resistance to this class of inhibitor could develop by mutating this single residue. Nonetheless, it is reassuring that the mutant enzyme produced is kinetically crippled, with a kcat over 2 orders of magnitude lower than the wild type. This implies that mutation of the serine is likely to be fatal to the plasmodium. Table VI suggests the major reason for low activity in the absence of the serine is the reduced ability of the mutant enzyme to bind pyruvate (KM(WT)/KM(S245A) = 114) rather than NADH (KM(WT)/KM(S245A) = 4.1). One explanation is that the optimal binding site for the substrate may result from subtle rearrangements that follow binding of the cofactor and may involve the Ser-245 to Pro-246 region.Table"

Analysis of circular dichroic spectra of purified bacterially expressed MD-2 indicates high content of β-type secondary structure, in agreement with the structural model. Bacterially expressed MD-2 was able to confer LPS responsiveness to cells expressing TLR4 despite lacking glycosylation. We identified several clusters of basic residues on the surface of MD-2. Mutation of each of two clusters encompassing the residues Lys89-Arg90-Lys91 and Lys125-Lys125 significantly decreased the signal transduction of the respective MD-2 mutants either upon co-expression with TLR4 or upon addition as soluble protein into the supernatant of cells overexpressing TLR4. These basic clusters lie at the edge of the β-sheet sandwich, which in cholesterol-binding protein connected to Niemann-Pick disease C2 (NPC2), dust mite allergen Der p2, and ganglioside GM2-activator protein form a hydrophobic pocket.

Diversity of TLRs enables finetuning of host response to a wide variety of different microbes such as bacteria and fungi.

Jerala R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 292: 880-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, only information about the tertiary structure of MD-2 would enable to put these results into a broader perspective and comprehensively elucidate the molecular interactions involved in LPS recognition. The only tertiary structure of the LPS-protein complex has been determined for the bacterial iron uptake receptor FhuA (19Ferguson A.D. Hofmann E. Coulton J.W. Diederichs K. Welte W. Science. 1998; 282: 2215-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). This structure initiated the proposition of an LPS-binding motif, defined by the geometric arrangement of basic residues, which has also been identified on several LPS-binding proteins (20Ferguson A.D. Welte W. Hofmann E. Lindner B. Holst O. Coulton J.W. Diederichs K. Struct. Fold Des. 2000; 8: 585-592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (180) Google Scholar), as well as on other proteins. 2R. Jerala, unpublished observation. 2R. Jerala, unpublished observation. The proposal of an LPS-binding motif was based solely on electrostatic interactions, which are certainly not sufficient since the importance of the number of acyl chains in LPS recognition has been well recognized (21Alexander C. Rietschel E.T. J. Endotoxin Res. 2001; 7: 167-202PubMed Google Scholar). The structural homology of the LPS recognition motif of MD-2 is more likely to be found among the complexes of soluble proteins with glycolipids such as gangliosides, for example, rather than among the integral membrane proteins such as FhuA. The structure of GM2 ganglioside activating protein (GM2-AP) has been determined both in free form and in complex with ganglioside ligands (22Wright C.S. Li S.C. Rastinejad F. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 411-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 23Wright C.S. Zhao Q. Rastinejad F. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331: 951-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In the case of GM2-AP the glycolipid binds into the apolar pocket formed between the β-sheets and involves significant conformational changes between the closed and open conformation of the binding pocket. Structures of other members of this protein superfamily have been determined which show a lipid-binding pocket expansion after binding of ligands such as cholesterol to NPC2 protein (24Friedland N. Liou H.L. Lobel P. Stock A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2512-2517Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) or an unidentified hydrophobic ligand to the mite allergen protein Der p2 (25Derewenda U. Li J. Derewenda Z. Dauter Z. Mueller G.A. Rule G.S. Benjamin D.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The aim of our work was to provide a model of the tertiary structure of MD-2 and assess its reliability by relating it to recently reported characteristics of MD-2 and our experimental results. We have prepared a tertiary structure model of MD-2, which allowed delineation of functional molecular epitopes essential for LPS signaling. Peptides—A peptide MD2S (Ac-CRGSDDDYSFC-NH2) was synthesized by the W. M. Keck facility at Yale University using the Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl)) method. The peptide was oxidized by overnight incubation in 50 mm sodium carbonate buffer, pH 8.5. The oxidized and reduced form of the peptide were separated and purified by high pressure liquid chromatography. The concentration of the free SH group was determined by using 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) reagent, which binds to free SH groups (26Thannhauser T.W. Konishi Y. Scheraga H.A. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Cell Lines—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells (ATCC number CRL-1573) and THP-1 cells (ATCC number TIB-202) were used. HEK293 cells were cultured as adherent monolayer at 37 °C, 8% CO2 and 95% humidity in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) FCS (PAA, Laboratories) and 1% (v/v) penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen). THP-1 cells were grown in suspension culture in RPMI (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) FCS (PAA, Laboratories), 1% (v/v) l-glutamine (Invitrogen), and 1% (v/v) penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen). For culture, 10-fold dilutions in fresh medium were prepared from cells grown in culture flasks for 3 days. Homology Modeling of MD-2—Search for homologues of human MD-2 in the GeneBank™ data base of translated nucleotide sequences was performed using BLAST or PSI-BLAST (27Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (58771) Google Scholar). Fold recognition was performed and evaluated with metaserver 3D-Jury, which combines 13-fold recognition predictor algorithms and has been one of the most successful predictors in the recent CASP5 protein structure prediction assessment (28Ginalski K. Rychlewski L. Proteins. 2003; 53: 410-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Sequential alignment for homology modeling was based on the sequence threading identified by the Fugue2 algorithm (29Shi J. Blundell T.L. Mizuguchi K. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 243-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar). Tertiary structures of bovine cholesterol-binding protein connected to Niemann-Pick disease (NPC2) (Protein Data Bank code 1NEP) (24Friedland N. Liou H.L. Lobel P. Stock A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2512-2517Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) and Der p2 mite allergen structures (Protein Data Bank codes 1A9V and 1KTJ (25Derewenda U. Li J. Derewenda Z. Dauter Z. Mueller G.A. Rule G.S. Benjamin D.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 30Mueller G.A. Benjamin D.C. Rule G.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12707-12714Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar)) were used as templates for comparative modeling. The program MODELLER, version 6v2 (31Sali A. Potterton L. Yuan F. van Vlijmen H. Karplus M. Proteins. 1995; 23: 318-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar) was used to generate 100 tertiary structure models using constrained disulfide bonds in the same topology as in tertiary structures of ML proteins. Structures were refined by MD annealing. The structure prediction of loop 38–51 was additionally optimized by application of the ModLoop program (32Fiser A. Sali A. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 2500-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar) in the context of complete structure, which further improved the energy function of the former model. Tertiary structure models were ranked by the “Modeler's objective function” and evaluated with Procheck (33Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) and subsequently by Verify3D (34Zhang K.Y. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 687-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) to identify the regions of highest and lowest quality of the model. Preparation of Recombinant MD-2 and Determination of Its Secondary Structure—The coding sequence of mature human MD-2, provided by Dr. Miyake, was amplified by PCR (primers ACGTCCATGGCGCAGAAGCAGTATTGGGTCTG and ACGTCTCGAGCTAATTTGAATTAGGTTGGTGTAGG) introduced through NcoI and XhoI sites into the pET14b cloning vector and protein expressed in BL21(DE3) pLysS bacterial cells (Novagen) (35Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4772) Google Scholar). Recombinant protein was produced in form of inclusion bodies, which were washed with 0.1% B-PER® Bacterial Protein Extraction Reagent (Pierce). The resulting protein pellet was solubilized in 6 m guanidinium hydrochloride, 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 5.0, and applied to RP SDVB monolithic disks (BIA Separations, Ljubljana, Slovenia). Proteins were separated and eluted upon application of acetonitrile and 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid at a gradient of 5–95% acetonitrile to the column. After solvent evaporation, eluted proteins were dissolved in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer at pH 7.0. SDS-PAGE confirmed homogeneity of the protein. Circular dichroic spectra of recombinant MD-2 at a concentration of 0.18 mg/ml dissolved in water were measured on an Aviv spectropolarimeter 62A (Aviv Associates) using quartz cuvettes with a path length of 0.1 cm for the far-UV region (190–260 nm). For the far-UV CD data analysis, the circular dichroism was calculated as the mean residue ellipticity θMRW (degree·cm2·dmol-1) using a mean molar residue weight of 115 for calculation. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Specific point mutations were introduced into human MD-2 using site-directed mutagenesis. A site-directed mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used, and the reaction was performed according to manufacturer's instructions. The sequences of primers used for PCR were as follows: MD2/70, 5-CACATTTTCTACATTCCAAGGGCAGATTTAGCGCAATTATATTTCAATCTCTATATAACTG-3 and 5-CAGTTATATAGAGATTGAAATATAATTGCGCTAAATCTGCCCTTGGAATGTAGAAAATGTG-3; MD2/90, 5-CACCATGAATCTTCCAGCGGCCGCAGAAGTTATTTGCCGAG-3 and 5-CTCGGCAAATAACTTCTGCGGCCGCTGGAAGATTCATGGTG-3; MD2/120, 5-CTCCTTCAAGGGAATAGCATTTTCTGCGGGAAAATACAAATGTGTTG-3 and 5-CAACACATTTGTATTTTCCCGCAGAAAATGCTATTCCCTTGAAGGAG-3. The complete sequences of MD-2 mutants were controlled by DNA sequencing. Preparation of Cellular Extracts—HEK293 cells were detached from cell culture plates with a diameter of 9 cm in 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and harvested by spinning for 7 min at 4 °C and 1200 rpm. Cell pellets were resuspended in 40–100 μl of lysis buffer (36Meng G. Grabiec A. Vallon M. Ebe B. Hampel S. Bessler W. Wagner H. Kirschning C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39822-39829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), transferred to Eppendorf tubes, and incubated on ice for 20 min. Cell debris was removed from the suspension by spinning twice for 20 min at 4 °C and 13,000 rpm. Preparation of MD-2 Conditioned Supernatants—1 × 106 cells of cell clones stably expressing MD-2 mutants were seeded in a 15-cm dish in 10% FCS and grown overnight. Medium was exchanged for 2% FCS supplemented medium and the volume reduced from 20 to 10 ml/dish. After 6 days, supernatants were recovered and cleared by spinning twice for 20 min at 4 °C and 4300 rpm, as well as stored at -20 °C. Protein concentration of MD-2 in supernatant was estimated from Coomassie-stained SDS gel in comparison with protein standard. Expression levels of mutants applied were comparable as revealed by MD-2 tag-specific immunoblot analysis (data not shown). Immunoprecipitation—Proteins overexpressed in HEK293 cells carried epitope tags FLAG (MD-2) or Myc (TLR4, expression vector provided by Tularik). FLAG-tagged proteins were precipitated upon cellular lysis with αFLAG affinity gel (beads; Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany). Aliquots of 20 μl were removed from lysates for expression control. 15 μl of beads were added to the suspension and rotated for 2 h. The beads were washed. Recovered material was resuspended in SDSsample buffer and applied to SDS-PAGE. Precipitation and co-precipitation were analyzed by application of respective antibodies at dilutions of 1:1000 for anti Flag (polyclonal rabbit, Sigma) or 1:5000 for anti Myc antisera (polyclonal rabbit; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Flow Cytometry Analysis—HEK293 cells were seeded and transiently transfected. 56 h later, cells were harvested in 5 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline and washed. An aliquot of 5 × 105 cells was stained in a volume of 60 μl. Liquid was removed, and primary antibodies (αFLAG, αMyc) were applied at a concentration of 8 μg/ml and incubated for 20 min on ice. Cells were washed twice. Secondary peroxidase-coupled antibodies were added to a final concentration of 2 μg/ml. Samples were incubated for 20 min on ice and washed twice again. Fluorescence measurement was carried out on a fluorescenceactivated cell sorter Calibur flow cytometer, and data were processed applying the Cellquest software (BD Bioscience, Heidelberg, Germany). Luciferase Reporter Assay—HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with NF-κB-dependent and constitutive reporter plasmids, as well as 2.5 ng of TLR4 and MD-2 expression vectors. 24 h after transfection start cells were challenged with agonists for 16 h. For analysis of MD-2 peptide function, peptides were added 60 min prior to stimulation at a final concentration of 25 μg/ml. The cells were lysed in reporter lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI) and lysates analyzed for reporter gene activities. β-Galactosidase activities were analyzed and used for normalization. For measuring the activity of bacterially expressed MD-2, HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with NF-κB-dependent reporter plasmid, constitutive reporter plasmid, and 2.5 ng of TLR4 expression vector. Various dilutions of bMD-2 (stock concentration was 30 μm) were incubated with 100 ng/ml LPS prior to stimulation of TLR4 transfected HEK293 cells. Conditioned supernatant from MD-2 producing HEK293 cells with estimated concentration of MD-2 of 1 μg/ml was used as a positive control. Human IL-8 and TNFα ELISA—IL-8 and TNFα release from HEK293 and human monocytic THP-1 cells were determined in 96-well plates using ELISA kits purchased from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). 1 × 105 cells were seeded per well of a 96-well plate. THP-1 cells were differentiated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate at a concentration of 50 ng/ml for 24 h. MD-2 peptides were added to a final concentration of 25 μg/ml. 60 min later, ultrapure LPS from Salmonella minnesota Re595 (List, Campbell, CA) was added. Supernatants were removed 16 h (HEK293) or 4 h (THP-1) after stimulation and analyzed by ELISA. Duplicate samples were prepared and analyzed. Fold Recognition and Model of Tertiary Structure of MD-2—Search through the GeneBank™ data base for amino acid sequences similar to human MD-2 revealed nine additional MD-2/MD-1 family members. The more sensitive fold recognition approach, which is able to detect structurally compatible sequences (28Ginalski K. Rychlewski L. Proteins. 2003; 53: 410-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), recognized similarity to the members of a family of lipid-binding proteins (ML superfamily (37Inohara N. Nunez G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 219-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar)) also including a number of proteins for which tertiary structures have been determined. Consensus fold recognition by the 3D-Jury metaserver (28Ginalski K. Rychlewski L. Proteins. 2003; 53: 410-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) identified compatibility of the MD-2 sequence with tertiary structures of members of the early Ig-like family of protein from the SCOP (structural classification of proteins (38Andreeva A. Howorth D. Brenner S.E. Hubbard T.J. Chothia C. Murzin A.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: D226-D229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) data base and ranked them on the first 11 positions of the resulting list. The secondary structure of MD-2 was predicted using a consensus of secondary prediction algorithms implemented in the PredictProtein server (39Rost B. Liu J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3300-3304Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The majority of MD-2 residues were predicted to be in the extended (β) structure (55%) with a minimal content of helical structure (5%). The structure fold most compatible with human as well as murine MD-2 sequence was Der p2 protein (Protein Data Bank code 1A9V) (30Mueller G.A. Benjamin D.C. Rule G.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12707-12714Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), which contains 38% of sequence similarity and 16% identity to human MD-2, followed by NPC2 (Protein Data Bank code 1NEP) (24Friedland N. Liou H.L. Lobel P. Stock A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2512-2517Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) with 26% of similarity and 12% of identity. The predicted secondary structure of MD-2 agrees with secondary structure content of those two tertiary structures. Application of the Fugue2 fold recognition algorithm (29Shi J. Blundell T.L. Mizuguchi K. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 243-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar) estimated that the probability of Der p2 and human MD-2 having the same structural fold is >95%. Comparative structure modeling using program Modeler (31Sali A. Potterton L. Yuan F. van Vlijmen H. Karplus M. Proteins. 1995; 23: 318-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar) was based on the alignment from fold recognition. Within the alignment of MD-2 homologues along with NPC2 and Der p2, locations of six of the cysteine residues present in all of them were congruous suggesting conservation of disulfide-bonding topology (Fig. 1). The only unpaired cysteine in MD-2 having no counterpart in NPC2 or Der p2 is Cys133, which is absent in MD-1 protein family. Our structural model of MD-2 contains the following features. MD-2 has the β sandwich-type fold composed of seven strands arranged in two layers of antiparallel β-sheets. In comparison to NPC2 and Der p2 MD-2 contains two insertions composed of eight and five residues, which were modeled as expansions of surface loops already present in Der p2 and NPC2 (Fig. 2). Both loops are flanked by disulfides, which are conserved in the tertiary structures of ML proteins. The conformation of surface loops in the model should be rather regarded as undefined in our model, since the reliability of theoretical modeling of such insertions is generally low, which is also reflected by the fact that Verfy3D score was the lowest in the eight-residue insertion loop (residues 39–51). The global features of our model of MD-2 fold, however, are most likely correct as they were confirmed by the results of our functional analysis based on the model predictions as follows.Fig. 2Schematic representation of structural model of MD-2. Left panel, schematic representation of MD-2 backbone with highlighted disulfide cysteine residues (gold spheres) and Cys95–Cys105 loop (MD2S peptide, red). Right panel, surface representation of point mutants tested in this work.

Mazzoni A. Spitzer J.A. Segal D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12156-12161Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). bMD-2 conferred LPS reactivity to HEK293 cells transfected with TLR4 at concentrations below 30 nm, which is comparable with the specific activity of MD-2 from eucaryotic cell supernatant (Fig. 3B). Addition of MD-2 slightly increased the base-line activation of TLR4 transfected HEK293 cells as reported before for MD-2 isolated from supernatant of eucaryotic cells (40Lee H.K. Dunzendorfer S. Tobias P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10564-10574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), but maximal response was achieved by stimulation with LPS. UV circular dichroic (CD) spectrum of refolded MD-2 is typical of a protein rich in β structure (Fig. 3C). Maximum of intrinsic fluorescence emission of MD-2, which contains a single tryptophan residue (Trp23), was at 348 nm (data not shown), indicating high solvent exposure of this residue, which is also in agreement with tertiary structure model (predicted 24% exposure to solvent).

Here we demonstrate that the sumoylation of NFAT1 defines a novel mechanism of the nuclear anchorage and transcriptional activation downstream from the known mechanism of calcineurin-mediated dephosphorylation and nuclear import. We show that Lys684 and Lys897 of NFAT1 can be sumoylated. The sumoylation at Lys684 is required for NFAT1 transcriptional activity and subsequent sumoylation of Lys897, whereas the sumoylation of Lys897 is only required for nuclear anchorage. Because Lys897 of NFAT1 is not conserved among other members of the NFAT family, we propose that sumoylation of Lys897 may provide a mechanism for NFAT1 isotype-specific regulation of nuclear anchorage and transcriptional activation. Furthermore, we found that treatment with both ionomycin and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ensured efficient nuclear anchorage with the recruitment of NFAT1 into the SUMO-1 bodies, whereas treatment with ionomycin alone induced nuclear translocation of NFAT1 but not recruitment into the SUMO-1 bodies. Our results suggest that the recruitment of NFAT1 into SUMO-1 bodies may be required for the progressive transcriptional activity of NFAT1 upon co-stimulation with ionomycin and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, whereas anergic transcription stimulated by ionomycin alone may occur without recruitment into the SUMO-1 bodies.

Nature. 1998; 392: 182-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar), although the mechanisms that determine the regulatory and functional specificities of different NFATs are not fully elucidated. The N termini of NFAT family members share a conserved sequence about ∼300 amino acids in length known as the NFAT homologous region (NFAT-h). The NFAT-h is known to regulate nuclear/cytoplasmic trafficking of NFATs in response to changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentrations. In resting T cells, NFATs are retained in the cytoplasm, and the NFAT-h is heavily phosphorylated. Engagement of the T-cell antigen receptor or treatment of cells with Ca2+ ionophores activates calcineurin, a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent Ser/Thr phosphatase, which dephosphorylates the NFAT-h, resulting in rapid translocation of the proteins to the nucleus (10Liu J. Farmer Jr., J.D. Lane W.S. Friedman J. Weissman I. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1991; 66: 807-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3634) Google Scholar). The nuclear translocation of NFATs is critically important for regulating NFAT activity. Immunosuppressive drugs FK506 and cyclosporin A block this translocation by inhibiting calcineurin activity in T cells as well as in nonhemopoietic cells, which leads to undesired side effects (11Griffith J.P. Kim J.L. Kim E.E. Sintchak M.D. Thomson J.A. Fitzgibbon M.J. Fleming M.A. Caron P.R. Hsiao K.

Considerable efforts are being made to identify additional mechanisms that regulate the nuclear translocation of NFATs with the hope of elucidating isoform-specific or cell type-specific mechanisms that would allow the development of new drugs without unpleasant side effects. Protein posttranslational modifications by a variety of mechanisms play crucial roles in regulating protein function. Ubiquitination represents a particular case where ubiquitin, itself a small polypeptide, is covalently linked to lysine residues in a protein to target it for proteasomal degradation or other signaling pathways. Recently, several proteins that share similarity with ubiquitin have been identified. One member of this ubiquitin-like protein family is SUMO-1 (also known as sentrin, GMP1, UBL1, and PIC1), a polypeptide of 101 amino acids that can be attached covalently to proteins in a process that is mechanically analogous to ubiquitination (13Muller S. Hoege C. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). The SUMO-1 activating enzyme catalyzes the ATP-dependent activation of SUMO-1, the first step in the conjugation pathway (14Desterro J.M. Rodriguez M.S. Kemp G.D. Hay R.T. J. Biol.

The observation that RanGAP1 and PML are targeted to distinct subcellular structures upon conjugation to SUMO-1 suggests that modification by SUMO-1 might play an important role in regulating the subcellular localization of proteins. Modification by SUMO has been shown to play critical roles in both nuclear and cytoplasmic processes, such as nuclear transport, transcription, and subnuclear targeting, which ultimately contribute to regulation of the cell cycle, cell growth, and apoptosis. To explore the mechanisms and functions of sumoylation in regulating cellular processes, we developed a screening system for sumoylated proteins. Using this system, we determined that NFAT1 is sumoylated and that sumoylation of NFAT1 regulates the cytoplasmic-nuclear trafficking, subnuclear localization, and transcription of NFAT1. We show that ionomycin and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), agents commonly used to activate the transcriptional activity of NFATs and T-cell activation, exhibit distinct effects on the sumoylation of NFAT1. Our study identified sumoylation as a novel nuclear anchorage and transcriptional regulatory mechanism for NFAT1 that may provide isoform-specific regulation. Plasmids and Antibodies—pEGFP-SUMO-1-(1–97), pGEX-6P-SUMO-1-(1–97), and pcDNA4-HisMax-SUMO-1-(1–97) were generated by PCR amplification of SUMO-1 from expressed sequence tag cDNA clone 25786 (Research Genetics, Inc., Huntsville, AL). Myc-tagged NFAT1 expression vector was made by cloning mouse NFAT1 cDNA into XhoI and ApaI sites of pcDNA3-myc vector. Point mutants of NFAT1, K684R, K897R, K684R/K897R, and DBD (K532R), were generated using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). A deletion mutant NFAT1, del C-(1–683), was generated by PCR. Anti-NFAT 1 antibodies (clones 4G6-G5 and G1-D10), monoclonal anti-myc antibody (9E10), and polyclonal anti-hemagglutinin antibody (Y-11) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-SUMO-1 antibodies (clones 21C7 and FL101) were purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc. and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, respectively. In Vitro Expression Cloning for Sumoylation Substrates—Pools from a mouse spleen cDNA library (28Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3798) Google Scholar) were in vitro transcribed and translated as [35S]methionine-labeled proteins as described previously. Sumoylation assays were performed in a total volume of 20 μl in reaction buffer (20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm ATP, 3.5 units of creatine phosphokinase, and 5 mm phosphocreatine) containing 200 μg/ml recombinant human SUMO-1 activating enzyme 1/SUMO-1 activating enzyme 2 as E1 and 50 μg/ml Ubc9 as E2 (plasmids expressing human E1 and Ubc9 were kind gifts from Dr. Ronald T. Hay; University of Saint Andrews, Saint Andrews, UK). Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 1 h and terminated by the addition of sample buffer. Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—BHK cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were transfected with Mirus TransIT LT1 (Mirus Corp.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Electroporation—Jurkat cells were cultured at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Fifteen million Jurkat cells were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline and resuspend in 1 ml of Eppendorf Hypoosmolar electroporation buffer (Fisher) and 1.25% Me2SO. Twenty μg of His-tagged sumo-1 construct was aliquoted into the 4-mm electroporation cuvettes, and then the cells were added and mixed. Electroporation was performed at 130 V and 900 microfarads, and cells were kept at room temperature for 5 min. They were plated in 4 ml of complete RPMI 1640 media plus 50 μlofMe2SO. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 3.5 h and then overlaid on top of 3 ml of Ficoll-Plaque Plus solution (Amersham Biosciences) and spun down at 800 × g for 40 min. The interface band was collected and washed once with complete media. Jurkat cells were incubated with or without ionomycin or ionomycin plus PMA in the presence or absence of cyclosporin A for 1 h, and cells were lysed with 6 m guanidine buffer (Invitrogen). The lysates were applied onto Probond resin (Invitrogen), and His-tagged sumo-1-conjugated proteins were purified under denaturing conditions according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Immunocytochemistry/Subcellular Localization—BHK cells were transfected with myc-tagged full-length wild-type or mutant NFAT1. Myc-tagged NFAT1 was detected with anti-myc antibody followed by Alexa594-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes). For endogenous proteins, Jurkat cells were incubated with or without ionomycin or ionomycin plus PMA in the presence or absence of cyclosporin A. After 1 h, cells were fixed and immunostained with monoclonal anti-NFAT1 antibody (G1-D10) and polyclonal anti-sumo-1 antibody (FL101). Alexa594-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody and Alexa488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody were used as secondary antibodies. Immunofluorescence microscopic analysis was performed by laser scanning fluorescence confocal microscopy (Bio-Rad). In Vivo Sumoylation Assay—Cells were co-transfected with the expression constructs of GFP-SUMO-1 and myc-tagged wild-type NFAT1 or mutants. Twenty-four h after transfection, the cells were lysed with lysis buffer (200 mm NaCl and 0.25% SDS) and then sonicated. Samples were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min, and supernatants were collected. For immunoprecipitation, supernatant was diluted 1:10 with Nonidet P-40 buffer (20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 20 mm dithiothreitol). After pre-clearing with protein A/G-agarose, NFAT1 was immunoprecipitated with anti-myc antibody (9E10) complexed protein A/G beads. Luciferase Assay—BHK cells were transfected with NFAT1 expression plasmids, NFAT/AP1 promoter-driven luciferase expression plasmid, Fas ligand (FasL) promoter-driven luciferase expression plasmid (a kind gift from Dr. Shyr-Te Ju, Boston University of School of Medicine), or Renilla luciferase expression plasmid (Promega). FasL mutant promoter-driven luciferase expression plasmid and nuclear factor-κB promoter-driven luciferase expression plasmid were used as negative controls. Twenty-four h after transfection, cells were treated for 3 h with control or ionomycin plus PMA in the presence or absence of leptomycin B (LMB) (10 ng/ml). Luciferase units were normalized to Renilla luciferase readings within each transfection and are expressed as relative luciferase units. To determine the protein levels of wild-type NFAT1 and NFAT1 mutants, immunoblotting was performed at the same time. Identification of NFAT1 as a Sumoylation Substrate—To identify the substrates for sumoylation, we in vitro transcribed and translated small pools from a mouse spleen cDNA library (28Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3798) Google Scholar) in the presence of [35S]methionine, using the methods of Lustig et al. (29Lustig K.D. Stukenberg P.T. McGarry T.J. King R.W. Cryns V.L. Mead P.E. Zon L.I. Yuan J. Kirschner M.W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283: 83-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The radioactively labeled proteins were incubated with or without glutathione S-transferase-tagged SUMO-1 in the in vitro sumoylation reaction mix, and the products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. From screening of five pools, a positive clone was identified as murine NFAT1, a transcription factor that controls T-cell activation as well as the differentiation of a variety of other cell types (Fig. 1A). This cDNA clone contains the coding region for amino acids 715–1064 of NFAT1. To determine whether full-length NFAT1 can be sumoylated, we transcribed and translated in vitro a cDNA clone encoding a myc-tagged full-length NFAT1 in the presence of [35S]methionine and performed an in vitro sumoylation assay with [35S]methionine-labeled NFAT1. In the presence of recombinant sumoylation enzymes, E1 and UBC9, a portion of myc-NFAT1 migrated on SDS-PAGE at a slower rate, consistent with the covalent modification of NFAT1 by glutathione S-transferase-SUMO-1 (37 kDa) (Fig. 1B). Two forms of modified NFAT1 were detected (Fig. 1B); because SUMO-1 is not known to polysumoylate itself (23Muller S. Matunis M.J. Dejean A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar), this result suggests that NFAT1 has two possible sumoylation sites. Like all members of the NFAT family, NFAT1 is normally present in the cytoplasm of resting cells; when T cells are activated, NFAT1 is dephosphorylated by the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin, translocates to the nucleus, and becomes transcriptionally active (1Crabtree G.R. Cell. 1999; 96: 611-614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar, 30Okamura H. Aramburu J. Garcia-Rodriguez C. Viola J.P. Raghavan A. Tahiliani M. Zhang X. Qin J. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 539-550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 31Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2227) Google Scholar). Nuclear localization of NFAT1 can be induced by low, sustained levels of elevated intracellular free Ca2+, which can be achieved by stimulation of self-antigen, low-affinity peptide-major histocompatibility complex complexes, or most conveniently, low concentrations of Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin (32Dolmetsch R.E. Lewis R.S. Goodnow C.C. Healy J.I. Nature. 1997; 386: 855-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (1563) Google Scholar). To examine the sumoylation of NFAT1 in vivo and a possible effect of intracellular free Ca2+ on sumoylation, BHK cells were transfected with the expression constructs of myc-tagged NFAT1 and GFP-SUMO-1; 24 h later, the cells were treated with control, ionomycin, or ionomycin plus PMA. The results were analyzed by Western blots and immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1, C and D). Consistent with previously published reports (30Okamura H. Aramburu J. Garcia-Rodriguez C. Viola J.P. Raghavan A. Tahiliani M. Zhang X. Qin J. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 539-550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), when myc-NFAT1 was transfected alone without additional treatment, NFAT1 was expressed as a single protein species that was known to be phosphorylated. Treatment with ionomycin, with or without co-treatment with PMA, induced dephosphorylation of NFAT1 as indicated by a downshift on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1C) (30Okamura H. Aramburu J. Garcia-Rodriguez C. Viola J.P. Raghavan A. Tahiliani M. Zhang X. Qin J. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 539-550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Interestingly, co-transfection of myc-NFAT1 with GFP-SUMO-1 significantly elevated the myc-NFAT1 levels (Fig. 1C); furthermore, a portion of myc-NFAT1 now migrated as two slower-migrating species consistent with singly (177 kDa) and doubly (214 kDa) sumoylated forms (Fig. 1C). These two bands were confirmed as NFAT1 by anti-NFAT1 antibody (data not shown). Treatment with ionomycin with or without PMA induced dephosphorylation of myc-NFAT1 and increased the levels of sumoylated NFAT1 (Fig. 1C). To confirm that the two slower-migrating myc-NFAT1 forms are indeed sumoylated, total myc-tagged NFAT1 protein was immunoprecipitated with anti-myc antibody and then analyzed by Western blotting with anti-GFP antibody to detect GFP-SUMO-1-conjugated proteins (Fig. 1D). This analysis confirmed that both slower-migrating bands are indeed SUMO-1-modified myc-NFAT1. These results suggest that overexpression of SUMO-1 can increase the level of NFAT1 and induce the sumoylation of NFAT1, which can be further stimulated by treatment with ionomycin. In ionomycin- and ionomycin + PMA-treated but not control or ionomycin + cyclosporin A-treated Jurkat cells, our Western blots using anti-NFAT1 detected two additional species with a larger apparent molecular mass than that of phosphorylated and unphosphorylated NFAT1 (Fig. 1E). As commonly found in sumoylation studies, the presence of possible efficient desumoylation mechanisms in lysed cells prevented us from immunoprecipitating these two larger forms of NFAT1 efficiently. To circumvent this problem and determine whether endogenous NFAT1 can be sumoylated, we electroporated Jurkat cells with His-tagged SUMO-1 expression construct. Twenty-four h after electroporation, the cells were treated with ionomycin, ionomycin + PMA, or ionomycin + cyclosporin A or left untreated for 1 h, and then the cells were lysed directly in 6 m guanidine. The cell lysate was applied to a Ni-column, and the proteins eluted from the Ni-column were Western blotted using anti-NFAT1 (Fig. 1E). Consistent with our above-mentioned data regarding transfected NFAT1, the two slower-migrating species of endogenous NFAT1 can only be detected in cells treated with ionomycin or ionomycin + PMA. Therefore, our data indicated that endogenous NFAT1 can be sumoylated in response to ionomycin and ionomycin + PMA stimulation. Determination of Sumoylation Sites of NFAT1—Sumoylation is known to occur on the lysine residue with a consensus sequence of ΨKXE, with Ψ representing a hydrophobic residue (33Melchior F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 591-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). To determine the lysine residues of NFAT1 serving as the SUMO-1 attachment sites, we focused on Lys684, Lys897, and Lys532 because they reside in a motif that fits the KXE consensus sumoylation site (Fig. 2A). The amino acids before Lys684 or Lys897 are leucine or valine, respectively, which are hydrophobic amino acid residues and therefore fit the preferred sumoylation sites from previous studies (33Melchior F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 591-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). The amino acid residue before Lys532 is arginine, which is not a hydrophobic amino acid residue; however, because this lysine resides in a domain that is highly conserved among all members of NFAT family, we included Lys532 in our analysis as well. Each of the three lysines was mutated individually to arginine, and the resulting NFAT1 point mutant cDNA clones were in vitro transcribed and translated into 35S-labeled proteins and analyzed in the in vitro sumoylation assay (Fig. 2B). The K532R mutation did not have any effect on in vitro sumoylation, indicating that Lys532 is not a sumoylation site. Interestingly, the K897R mutant had only one slower-migrating band corresponding to SUMO-1-modified NFAT1, whereas the K684R mutation abrogated both SUMO-1-modified NFAT1 species completely. These results suggest that NFAT1 has two sumoylation sites, Lys684 and Lys897, and that sumoylation of Lys684 is required for that of Lys897in vitro. Consistent with this proposal, a C-terminal deletion (amino acids 1–683) mutant (delC) and a double mutant (K684R/K897R) completely eliminated sumoylation of NFAT1 in vitro (Fig. 2B). To confirm that Lys684 and Lys897 are sumoylated in vivo, wild type, K684R, K897R, or K684R/K897R mutants were co-expressed in BHK cells together with GFP-SUMO-1, and the results were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2, C and D). The sumoylation of slower-migrating species of NFAT1 was again confirmed by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting (Fig. 2, C and D). Consistent with Fig. 1, the predominant sumoylated form of wild-type NFAT1 in the absence of ionomycin treatment is the 177-kDa form (Fig. 2C), which is eliminated by the K684R mutation but not by K897R mutation, suggesting that the 177-kDa NFAT1 is sumoylated at Lys684. On the other hand, the K897R mutation had no effect on the appearance of 177-kDa NFAT1. Treatment with ionomycin induced dephosphorylation of wild-type and mutant NFAT1 and promoted both sumoylated NFAT1 forms (177 and 214 kDa). Consistent with in vitro sumoylation analysis, 214-kDa NFAT1 is eliminated by both the K684R single mutation and K684R/K897R double mutation. These results suggest that 214-kDa NFAT1 is di-sumoylated at both Lys684 and Lys897 and that the sumoylation of Lys684 occurs first and is required for the sumoylation of Lys897. Any combination of mutations in these lysines, however, had no effect on the calcineurin-induced dephosphorylation induced by ionomycin, suggesting that the sumoylation of NFAT1 occurs in a step downstream from dephosphorylation by calcineurin. A Functional Role of Sumoylation at Lys897 in the Nuclear Retention of NFAT1—Sumolyation has been shown to promote the nuclear presence and function of proteins (33Melchior F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 591-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Because NFAT1 is known to shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleus, we determined whether sumoylation of NFAT1 plays a role in the nuclear translocation of NFAT1. As reported, wild-type NFAT1 expressed in BHK cells is predominantly cytoplasmic without additional treatment; the addition of ionomycin induced NFAT1 nuclear translocation efficiently (Fig. 3A). Treatment with LMB alone increased the nuclear presence of NFAT1, suggesting that NFAT1 shuttles between the cytoplasm and nucleus in the unstimulated cells. The expressed K684R, K897R, and K684R/K897R NFAT1 in unstimulated BHK cells were indistinguishable from those of wild-type NFAT1 (Fig. 3A, top row; Fig. 3B, top left panel). In contrast to wild-type NFAT1, however, a considerable portion of NFAT1 mutants in ionomycin-treated BHK cells remained cytoplasmic (Fig. 3A, second row). A quantitation of staining such as that in Fig. 3A showed that wild-type NFAT1 was nuclear in 75% of cells after ionomycin treatment, whereas the proportion of cells with nuclear NFAT1 in cells expressing K684R, K897R, and K684R/K897R was 30.1%, 28.3%, and 30.3%, respectively (Fig. 3B, top right panel). An additional portion of cells showed mutant NFAT1 in both the cytoplasm and nucleus (Fig. 3B, top right panel). These results suggest that mutations in these three lysine residues had a significant impact on either the nuclear transport or retention of NFAT1. To distinguish whether mutations in these three lysine residues affect the nuclear import or export of NFAT1, we treated cells expressing wild-type or mutant NFAT1 with the nuclear export inhibitor LMB. The response of NFAT1 mutants to LMB treatment alone was not significantly different from that of the wild type: each showed an increase in the nuclear presence of NFAT1, with the majority of cells exhibiting both cytoplasmic and nuclear NFAT1 in the presence of LMB (Fig. 3A, third row; Fig. 3B, bottom left panel). This result suggests that the basal cytoplasmic and nuclear shuttling of NFAT1 was not affected by the lysine mutations and that inhibition of nuclear export is sufficient to increase the nuclear presence of these NFAT1 mutants to an extent similar to that of wild type. Interestingly, whereas treatment with ionomycin alone was sufficient to induce efficient nuclear translocation of the wild type but not of the NFAT1 lysine mutants (Fig. 3A, second row; Fig. 3B, top right panel), the addition of LMB in the presence of ionomycin resulted in an exclusively nuclear presence of NFAT1 in ∼80% of cells expressing K684R, K897R, or K684R/K897R mutant as well as wild-type NFAT1 (WT) (Fig. 3A, last row; and Fig. 3B, bottom right panel). These results suggest that sumoylation is required not for nuclear import but for the nuclear retention of NFAT1 in control as well as in ionomycin-treated cells. Because the K897R mutation minimally affects the appearance of 214-kDa sumoylated NFAT1, these results suggest that sumoylation of Lys897 is critically needed for the nuclear retention of NFAT1. A Functional Role of Sumoylation at Lys684 in the Transcriptional Activity of NFAT1—To assess the role of sumoylation on NFAT1 function, we determined the impact of sumoylation on the transcriptional activity of NFAT1 using two known NFAT1-targeting promoters, a FasL promoter (34Matsui K. Fine A. Zhu B. Marshak-Rothstein A. Ju S.T. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3469-3473PubMed Google Scholar) and a NFAT/AP-1 promoter, in promoter-driven luciferase expression assays (Fig. 4A, left panels). FasL mutant promoter- and nuclear factor-κB promoter-driven luciferase assays were used as negative controls (Fig. 4A, right panels). As reported previously (30Okamura H. Aramburu J. Garcia-Rodriguez C. Viola J.P. Raghavan A. Tahiliani M. Zhang X. Qin J. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 539-550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), wild-type NFAT1 (WT) showed a high level of transcriptional activity after ionomycin plus PMA stimulation (Fig. 4A, left panels). The expression of the K684R, K897R, and K684R/K897R NFAT1 mutants showed a low level of transcriptional activity that did not respond to ionomycin plus PMA stimulation, consistent with their defects in nuclear retention. Because, as shown in Fig. 3, treatment with LMB and ionomycin promoted the nuclear presence of the wild-type, K684R, K897R, and K684R/K897R mutants, we examined whether treatment with LMB and ionomycin plus PMA could enhance the transcriptional activity of the wild-type, K684R, K897R, and K684R/K897R mutants (Fig. 4A, left panels). Treatment with LMB enhanced the transcriptional activity of wild-type NFAT1 (WT) slightly, probably in proportion to the slight increase in its nuclear localization(Fig. 4A, left panels). Surprisingly, treatment with LMB in the presence of ionomycin and PMA enhanced the transcription of the K897R mutant, but not that of the K684R and K684/897R mutants (Fig. 4A, left panels). This result suggests that the sumoylation at Lys684 of NFAT1 is important for transcriptional activity of NFAT1; whereas sumoylation at Lys897 is only required for nuclear retention of NFAT1. PMA Promoted the Recruitment of NFAT1 into Nuclear SUMO-1 Bodies—PMA and ionomycin are often used conjunctionally to promote the transcriptional activity of NFAT family and T-cell activation (10Liu J. Farmer Jr., J.D. Lane W.S. Friedman J. Weissman I. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1991; 66: 807-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3634) Google Scholar). Because treatment with ionomycin alone is sufficient to increase the sumoylation of NFAT1 (Fig. 1C), we determined whether PMA has a discernable effect on the sumoylation of NFAT1 by immunocytochemistry. We co-transfected BHK cells with myc-NFAT1 and GFP-SUMO-1; in unstimulated cells, the majority of NFAT1 is cytoplasmic, whereas the majority of SUMO-1 is nuclear (Fig. 5A, top row). Treatment with ionomycin induced nuclear translocation of NFAT1, but myc-NFAT1 is diffusely distributed throughout the nucleus (Fig. 5A, second row). Treatment with PMA alone resulted an increase in the number of SUMO-1 bodies in the nucleus and a possible increase in nuclear membrane-associated NFAT1 but was not sufficient to induce nuclear translocation of myc-NFAT1 (Fig. 5A, fourth row); however, treatment with both ionomycin and PMA resulted in the recruitment of NFAT1 into the SUMO-1 nuclear bodies (Fig. 5A, third row; Table I). These results suggest that the powerful effect of PMA on T-cell activation in the presence of ionomycin may be exerted by promoting the recruitment of NFAT1 into the nuclear SUMO-1 bodies. Furthermore, the recruitment of NFAT1 into the nuclear SUMO-1 bodies by PMA and ionomycin suggests that the SUMO-1 bodies are nuclear transcriptional hot spots.Table IThe effect of sumoylation on subnuclear localization of NFAT1Total no. of NFAT1 dots/cellTotal no. of SUMO-1 dots/cellTotal no. of co-localized dots/cellPercentage of cells with NFAT1 dotsWTaWT, wild type.No additives0.02.60.00.0Ionomycin2.55.02.536.0Ionomycin + PMA10.69.06.372.7PMA0.09.10.00.0K684RNo additives0.04.00.00.0Ionomycin0.06.00.00.0Ionomycin + PMA0.09.10.00.0K897RNo additives0.02.00.00.0Ionomycin0.04.00.00.0Ionomycin + PMA10.013.07.027.7K684R/K897RNo additives0.03.00.00.0Ionomycin0.06.00.00.0Ionomycin + PMA0.09.00.00.0a WT, wild type.

To determine whether mutations in the sumoylation sites affect the recruitment of NFAT1 mutants into the SUMO-1 bodies, we determined the subnuclear distribution of NFAT1 mutants with nuclear localization by immunostaining and confocal microscopy. K897R (Fig. 5C), but not K684R (Fig. 5B) and K684R/K897R NFAT1 mutants (Fig. 5D; Table I), was recruited into SUMO-1 bodies after treatment with ionomycin plus PMA. From these results, we conclude that Lys684, but not Lys897, of NFAT1 is required for the recruitment into the nuclear SUMO-1 bodies. Our study identified a novel mechanism regulating the nuclear presence and transcriptional activity of NFAT1. The sumoylation of Lys684 and Lys897 may occur in a sequential fashion because mutation of Lys684 blocks the sumoylation of Lys897. Furthermore, the K684R mutation blocks both transcriptional activity and recruitment into the nuclear SUMO-1 bodies, implying a possible mechanistic link between these two sumoylation events. On the other hand, the K897R mutation blocks only nuclear anchorage, which can be partially substituted by treatment with LMB. Furthermore, because mutations in neither Lys684 nor Lys897 affect the dephosphorylation of NFAT1 by calcineurin, our results suggest that sumoylation of NFAT1 regulates the nuclear anchorage and transcription of NFAT1 downstream from phosphorylation. Because Lys897 is localized to the C terminus of NFAT1 and distal to the NFAT-h, which is known to regulate nuclear translocation by interacting with calcineurin, our study identified a new mechanism that contributes to the regulation of the nuclear presence of NFAT1. Our study identified a previously unexpected role of Lys897, located in the C terminus of NFAT1, in the nuclear retention of NFAT1 and suggests the possibility that the C terminus of NFAT1 may interact with the nuclear export signal localized in the N terminus of the protein. The C-terminal tails of the NFAT family, where Lys897 is localized in NFAT1, are highly divergent, and a similar KXE sequence cannot be found in the other members of NFAT family. Although it is possible that sumoylation at Lys residues less conforming to the KXE consensus sequence occur in the C termini of other NFAT family members, our study suggests that sumoylation may provide one of the regulatory mechanisms differentiating the nuclear presence of different NFAT family members. Sumoylation has been shown to have diverse effects on proteins. Sumoylation of RanGAP1 promotes the interaction of RanGAP1 with the Ran-GTP-binding protein RanBP2 at the cytoplasmic face of the nuclear pore complex (21Mahajan R. Delphin C. Guan T. Gerace L. Melchior F. Cell. 1997; 88: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar, 35Saitoh H. Pu R. Cavenagh M. Dasso M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3736-3741Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), whereas SUMO-1 modification of the promyelocytic leukemia gene product (PML) targets the protein to PML oncogenic domains (23Muller S. Matunis M.J. Dejean A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar, 25Sternsdorf T. Jensen K. Will H. J.

Freemont P.S. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 381-393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sumoylation of NFAT1 appears to enhance both the nuclear retention of NFAT1 and SUMO-1 body targeting. Although Lys897 is localized in the C terminus of NFAT1, in which no homologous Lys residue is found in other members of NFAT1 family, homologous Lys residues for Lys684 NFAT1 that fit the motif ΨKXE can be found at least in NFAT3 and NFAT4, suggesting that NFAT3 and NFAT4 may be similarly sumoylated at this Lys as well. Because Lys684 is localized immediately after the known DNA binding domain of NFAT1, our results suggest that sumoylation at this Lys and its interaction with the DNA binding domain may be a shared mechanism for regulation of transcriptional activity in the NFAT family. How might sumoylation of Lys684 regulate the transcriptional activity of NFAT1? Overexpression of GFP-SUMO-1 significantly increased the levels of both sumoylated and unsumoylated NFAT1 (Fig. 2), suggesting that sumoylation of NFAT1 may increase the stability of NFAT1, which may account in part for the transcriptional activation. Furthermore, because K684R NFAT1 is transcriptionally inactive even in the presence of LMB, which prevents its exit from the nucleus, and is unable to be recruited into the nuclear SUMO-1 bodies in the presence of ionomycin and PMA, the sumoylation of Lys684 may allow NFAT1 to interact with a key protein complex critical for effective transcription. We propose that the sumoylation of Lys684 NFAT1 may provide a license for transcriptional activity of NFAT1. In lymphocytes, integration of Ca2+ and other signaling pathway results in productive activation, whereas unopposed Ca2+ signaling leads to tolerance or anergy. Calcium-regulated transcription factor NFAT has an integral role in both aspects of lymphocyte function. Ca2+/calcineurin signaling induces a limited set of anergy-associated genes, distinct from genes induced in the productive immune response. Thus, NFAT1 induces T-cell anergy in the absence of AP-1, and it induces a program of productive activation mediated by the cooperative NFAT·AP-1 complex in the presence of AP-1. Stimulation by ionomycin alone mimics anergy by inducing a limited set of anergy-associated genes, whereas ionomycin + PMA stimulation induces the productive immunoresponsive genes (37Macian F. Garcia-Cozar F. Im S.H. Horton H.F. Byrne M.C. Rao A. Cell. 2002; 109: 719-731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Given the distinct effects of stimulation with ionomycin alone and combined stimulation with both ionomycin and PMA, we speculate that perhaps the activation of anergy-associated genes can occur without association with the SUMO-1 bodies, whereas the activation of a productive immune response requires recruitment of NFAT1 into the nuclear SUMO-1 bodies, where the cooperative NFAT1·AP-1 complex may form.

We investigated cardiac fibrosis and left ventricular (LV) function in transgenic rats (TGR) expressing the human kallikrein 1 (hKLK1) gene in streptozotocin (STZ) -induced diabetic conditions. Six weeks after STZ injection, LV function was determined in male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats and TGR(hKLK1) (n=10/group) by a Millar tip catheter. Total collagen content (Sirius Red staining) and expression of types I, III, and VI collagen were quantified by digital image analysis. SD-STZ hearts demonstrated significantly higher total collagen amounts than normoglycemic controls, reflected by the concomitant increment of collagen types I, III, and VI. This correlated with a significant reduction of LV function vs. normoglycemic controls. In contrast, surface-specific content of the extracellular matrix, including collagen types I, III, and VI expression, was significantly lower in TGR(hKLK1)-STZ, not exceeding the content of SD and TGR(hKLK1) controls. This was paralleled by a preserved LV function in TGR(hKLK1)-STZ animals. The kallikrein inhibitor aprotinin and the bradykinin (BK) B2 receptor antagonist icatibant reduced the beneficial effects on LV function and collagen content in TGR(hKLK1)-STZ animals. Transgenic expression of hKLK1 counteracts the progression of LV contractile dysfunction and extracellular matrix remodeling in STZ-induced diabetic cardiomyopathy via a BK B2 receptor-dependent pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2049770402,"Progesterone receptor (PR), a ligand-activated transcription factor, is a key regulator of cellular proliferation and differentiation in reproductive tissues. The transcriptional activity of PR is influenced by co-regulatory proteins typically expressed in a tissue- and cell-specific fashion. We previously demonstrated that basic transcription element-binding protein-1 (BTEB1), a member of the Sp/Krüppel-like family of transcription factors, functionally interacts with the two PR isoforms, PR-A and PR-B, to mediate progestin sensitivity of target genes in endometrial epithelial cells in vitro. Here we report that ablation of the Bteb1 gene in female mice results in uterine hypoplasia, reduced litter size, and increased incidence of neonatal deaths in offspring. The reduced litter size is solely a maternal genotype effect and results from fewer numbers of implantation sites, rather than defects in ovulation. In the early pregnant uterus, Bteb1 expression in stromal cells temporally coincides with PR-A isoform-dependent decidual formation at the time of implantation. Expression of two implantation-specific genes, Hoxa10 and cyclin D3, was decreased in uteri of early pregnant Bteb1-null mutants, whereas that of Bteb3, a related family member, was increased, the latter possibly compensating for the loss of Bteb1. Progesterone responsiveness of several uterine genes was altered with Bteb1-null mutation. These results identify Bteb1 as a functionally relevant PR-interacting protein and suggest its selective modulation of cellular processes that are regulated by PR-A in the uterine stroma.

These proteins are recruited to the PR complex only when PR is bound to an antagonist, a consequence of the distinct conformations induced by agonists and antagonists on this protein.

Here we have shown that homozygous Bteb1-null (Bteb1–/–) female mice have altered uterine, but not ovarian, phenotypes from those of wild type (WT) mice. We also identified endometrial stromal cells as a major site of Bteb1 synthesis during early pregnancy and showed that in these cells, expression is temporally coincident with initial events in decidual formation, a process requiring PR-A regulation (33Mulac-Jericevik B.

Further, we have provided a molecular rationale for uterine hypoplasia and subfertility in Bteb1–/– mice by the identification of uterine growth-associated and P-responsive genes whose patterns of expression are altered in uteri of Bteb1–/– mice. Taken together, these findings suggest the functional contribution of BTEB1 to PR-A action in uterine endometrial stromal cells and provide support to the hypothesis that tissue-specific modulation of progestin activity by PR isoforms may involve their selective interaction with BTEB1. Experimental Animals—Animal experiments were conducted following protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Florida (Gainesville, FL) and the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (Little Rock, AR). Klf9/Bteb1 mutant mice (Bteb1lacZ) were generated by insertion of the bacterial β-galactosidase (LacZ) gene in-frame into the first exon of the mouse Bteb1 gene as described previously (23Morita M. Kobayashi A. Yamashita T. Shimanuki T. Nakajima O. Takahashi S. Ikegami S. Inokuchi K. Yamashita K. Yamamoto M. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2489-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Mice were genotyped by PCR of genomic DNA prepared from mouse tails by overnight digestion at 55 °C in Tris-HCl buffer containing Triton X-100 (0.5%) and proteinase K (50 μg/μl). Two primer pairs were used for PCR. The first pair detected the wild type allele (forward, 5′-ACATGGACTTCGTGGCTGCC-3′; reverse, 5′-CGCTGTCGGATCCTATATCC-3′) by the amplification of a 300-bp region within the first exon of the mouse Bteb1 gene, whereas the second pair detected the mutant allele (forward, 5′-ATGAACTGCAGGACGAGGCAGCG-3′; reverse, 5′-GGCGATAGAAGGCGATGCGCTG-3′) by the amplification of a 600-bp region within the neomycin (neo) resistance gene. PCR cycling parameters for Bteb1 and neo were 94 °C for 12 min (“hot start”), 94.5 °C for 45 s, 55 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 1 min for 35 cycles (30 cycles for neo), with extension at 72 °C for 7 min. The Bteb1lacZ colony was maintained on a hybrid background of 129/SvJ and C57Bl/6J strains by crossing heterozygous mutant mice (Bteb1+/–) in a continuous mating scheme. Mice were maintained on a 12-h light, 12-h dark schedule with ad libitum access to laboratory chow and water. Animal Studies—To evaluate litter size as a function of the Bteb1 gene, WT, Bteb1+/–, and Bteb1–/– females that were at least 6 weeks of age were mated to males of specified genotypes. The number of pups born from each mating was counted within 12 h after birth. In timed pregnancy studies, WT and Bteb1–/– females (6–8 weeks of age) were monitored for stage of the estrous cycle by appearance of vaginal smears using a Protocol™ Hema3® stain kit (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). Females at the proestrus stage of the estrous cycle were placed with Bteb1–/– (for WT females) or WT (for Bteb1–/– females) males in the afternoon of the same day; the presence of a vaginal plug in the morning of the next day was considered as 0.5 day postcoitum (0.5 dpc). The number of implantation sites at 6.5 dpc was determined by counting the number of visible embryos in the reproductive tract. Embryos were dissected out of the uterus prior to uterine tissue RNA extraction and histochemical analysis. In studies using ovariectomized animals, WT, Bteb1+/–, and Bteb1–/– littermates (6–8 weeks of age) were subjected to bilateral ovariectomy 14 days before subcutaneous injection with sesame oil (vehicle) or progesterone (100 μg/mouse) in sesame oil. Mice were killed 24 h after treatment, and the uterus was processed for RNA isolation. WT and Bteb1–/– mice (5–6 weeks old) were examined for differences in ability to ovulate following previously described protocols (32Lydon J.P. DeMayo F.J. Funk C.R. Mani S.K. Hughes A.R. Montgomery Jr., C.A. Shyamala G. Conneely O.M. O'Malley B.W. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2266-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (1522) Google Scholar). Serum Estrogen (E) and Progesterone (P) Levels—Female WT and Bteb1–/– littermates at 5–6 and 8–10 weeks of age, respectively, were anesthetized by Isofluorane (NovaPlus; Abbott Laboratories, Chicago, IL) inhalation, and blood was recovered by closed cardiac puncture. Serum was separated by centrifugation and stored at –20 °C prior to analysis. Radioimmunoassays for E and P were performed using Coat-A-Count Estradiol or Coat-A-Count Progesterone diagnostic kits following the manufacturer's protocols (Diagnostic Products Corp., Los Angeles, CA). Assays were performed in duplicate. Data are presented as least-squares mean ± S.E. Uterine Morphometry—Whole uteri from WT and Bteb1–/– mice at 3, 6, and 8 weeks of age were fixed in 4% neutral-buffered paraformaldehyde overnight and embedded in paraffin. Sections (5 μm thick) were mounted on poly(lysine)-coated slides (Fisher Scientific), deparaffinized, and rehydrated in a graded alcohol series, followed by xylene. Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin following standard procedures. Uterine diameter (measured from the luminal side of the epithelium to the opposite outer side of the myometrium) and luminal epithelial height were measured using a MCID video microscopy system equipped with MCID5+ software (Imaging Research, Inc., Ontario, Canada). Measurements were taken from five different areas per section, and data from two independent sections from WT (n = 3) and Bteb1–/– (n = 4) mice were analyzed. Western Blot Analysis—Nuclear extracts from uteri were prepared following previously described protocols (35Liu S.F. Haddad E.B. Adcock I. Salmon M. Koto H. Gilbey T. Barnes P.J. Chung K.F. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 121: 1241-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Proteins (100 μg/sample) measured by Lowry reagent using bovine serum albumin as standard were fractionated on SDS-10% polyacrylamide gels and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Standard Western blot techniques were used to detect Bteb1 using primary (0.1 μg/ml) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary (1:2000) antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and the enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagent (ECL; Amersham Biosciences) as previously described (26Zhang D. Zhang X.-L. Michel F.J. Blum J.L. Simmen F.A. Simmen R.C.M. Endocrinology. 2002; 140: 2517-2525Google Scholar). RNA Isolation and Real-time Quantitative RT-PCR (QPCR)—Non-pregnant and pregnant mice (age and pregnancy days indicated under each study) were killed by CO2 inhalation. Uteri were rapidly removed, homogenized in TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and stored at –80 °C prior to isolation of RNA following the manufacturer's instructions. Integrity of the RNA was confirmed using the RNA 6000 Nano LabChip kit with the Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer system (Agilent Biotechnologies, Palo Alto, CA). cDNA was synthesized from total RNA (1 μg) in a total reaction volume of 10 μl using random hexamers and MultiScribe reverse transcriptase in a two-step RT-PCR reaction (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Primers that span intron/exon junctions were designed to prevent amplification of residual genomic DNA, using PrimerExpress software (Applied Biosystems); these are summarized in Table I. QPCR was performed with the Light-Cycler-based SYBR Green I detection system (Applied Biosystems) using an ABI Prism 7000 sequence detector (Applied Biosystems). Amplification conditions were: preincubation at 50 °C for 2 min, DNA polymerase activation at 95 °C for 1 min, followed by 40 PCR cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. Experiments included a no-template control to detect template contamination, if any. The mRNA quantity was calculated at threshold cycles (CT) at which each fluorescent signal was first detected above background; this occurred below 35 cycles. Expression levels were normalized to that for a housekeeping gene, cyclophilin, to control for input RNA and are presented as arbitrary units (mean ± S.E.).Table IPrimer sequences for QPCRGeneForward primerReverse primerAccession no.Axl5′-GTGAAGTTCATGGCCGACATT-3′5′-TTCTTGGAGAGCCCGAAGTCT-3′BC008551.1Bteb35′-ACACAGGTGAGAGGCCTTTCG-3′5′-AGCATGCCTGGGTGGAAGT-3′NM_021366.2Calcitonin5′-CTAGCTTGGACAGCCCCAGAT-3′5′-TCCTTGGCCACATCCCTTTT-3′BC030071.1Cyclin D15′-GCATGTTCGTGGCCTCTAAGAT-3′5′-CCAGAAGCAGTTCCATTTGCA-3′NM_007631Cyclin D35′-GATGTCTTCCCTCTGGCTATGAACT-3′5′-ACAGCCTGGTCCGTATAGATGC-3′NM_07632.1Gapdh5′-TGTGTCCGTCGTGGATCTGA-3′5′-GCATCGAAGGTGGAAGAGTGG-3′BC023196Hoxa105′-GTTCCAAAGGCGAAAATGCA-3′5′-TTGTCTGTCCGTGAGGTGGAC-3′BC050839.1Hoxa115′-TCCAGCCTCCCTTCTTTTTTG-3′5′-GTAGCAGTGGGCCAGATTGC-3′NM_010450PR5′-TGTCATTCTACTCGCTGTGCCTTA-3′5′-CAAACTGGCTTTGACTCCTCAGT-3′NM_008829SLPI5′-AAGTCCTGCGGCCTTTTACCT-3′5′-GGCATTGTGGCTTCTCAAGCT-3′BC028509 Open table in a new tab X-Gal Staining—Isolated tissues were soaked in phosphate-buffered saline containing 20% sucrose, embedded in Tissue-Tek OCT medium (Fisher Scientific), and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Sections were cut (7 μm) using a cryostat, postfixed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% paraformaldehyde and 0.2% glutaraldehyde for 5 min, and then stained with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) (1 mg/ml) at 37 °C overnight, followed by counterstaining with neutral red (1%) in sodium acetate (50 mm, pH 3.3). Statistical Analysis—All reported values represent mean ± S.E. Differences were considered significant at p <0.05 using analysis of variance. Loss of Bteb1 Gene Expression in Bteb1–/– Females—The deletion of exon 1 of the Bteb1 gene and loss of Bteb1 protein expression in Bteb1–/– females was confirmed by PCR analysis of genomic DNA and by Western blot analysis of nuclear extracts prepared from uteri of 6-week-old animals, respectively (Fig. 1). The PCR fragment corresponding to the Bteb1 gene was detected in WT and Bteb1+/– females but, as expected, was absent in Bteb1–/– littermates. Conversely, the PCR fragment corresponding to the neomycin resistance gene neo was absent in DNA from WT but was present in DNA of Bteb1+/– and Bteb1–/– animals. Further, although a strong immunoreactive band corresponding to the Bteb1 protein was present in nuclear extracts from WT and Bteb1+/– uteri, this band was absent from Bteb1–/– extracts (Fig. 1). Results demonstrate ablation of uterine Bteb1 expression with targeted deletion of the Bteb1 gene. Growth Phenotype of Bteb1-deficient Mice—Bteb1–/– mutants exhibited no obvious external phenotype and appeared to mature normally (23Morita M. Kobayashi A. Yamashita T. Shimanuki T. Nakajima O. Takahashi S. Ikegami S. Inokuchi K. Yamashita K. Yamamoto M. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2489-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Because BTEB1 has been shown to influence proliferation of cells in vitro (36Zhang X.-L. Simmen F.A. Michel F.J. Simmen R.C.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2001; 181: 81-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), the growth rates of WT and Bteb1–/– offspring were evaluated. For studies of early postnatal growth (postnatal day (PN) 4, PN7, and at weaning (PN21)), both male and female littermates obtained from matings between WT males × WT females or between Bteb1–/– males × Bteb1–/– females were used. As shown in Fig. 2, inset, both WT and Bteb1–/– pups exhibited progressively increased body weights with age (PN4 <PN7 <PN21). Male and female pups of the same genotype did not differ (p >0.05) in body weight at these ages (data not shown). However, Bteb1–/– pups lagged slightly, albeit significantly (p <0.05), behind WT littermates in body weight. To determine whether the slower growth rates of Bteb1–/– pups persisted through early adulthood, age-matched WT, Bteb1+/–, and Bteb1–/– females were evaluated for changes in body weight from PN21 until PN140. Females of all three genotypes showed normal growth rates that did not differ significantly (Fig. 2). Thus, although Bteb1 deficiency appeared to negatively affect growth rate prior to weaning, this effect was lost during early adulthood, suggesting possible compensatory somatic growth at postweaning with loss of Bteb1 expression. Bteb1-deficient Females Are Subfertile—In previous studies (26Zhang D. Zhang X.-L. Michel F.J. Blum J.L. Simmen F.A. Simmen R.C.M. Endocrinology. 2002; 140: 2517-2525Google Scholar, 27Zhang X.-L.

Chem. 2003; 278: 21474-21482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), BTEB1 was demonstrated to function as a PR-interacting partner in the uterine endometrium in vitro; thus, the loss of Bteb1 expression in vivo could conceivably compromise a number of reproductive parameters, including pregnancy success. To assess the effect of uterine Bteb1 deficiency on litter size, WT, Bteb1+/–, and Bteb1–/– females between the ages of 6 weeks and 10 months were bred with males of all three genotypes, and the average litter size was determined for each breeding pair. As shown in Table II, Bteb1–/– females were subfertile, with an average of 4–5 pups/litter regardless of the male genotype. By contrast, WT and Bteb1+/– females had an average of 7–8 and 6 pups/litter, respectively. As observed for Bteb1–/– females, the litter sizes of WT and Bteb1+/– females were also unaffected by male genotype (Table II). These results indicate that decreased litter size is likely a maternal genotype effect and suggest that male fertility is not demonstrably compromised by loss of Bteb1 expression.Table IIAverage litter size for mouse breeding pairsGenotypeM(WT)M(+/-)M(-/-)F(WT)7.26 ± 0.407.16 ± 0.607.80 ± 0.51n = 14n = 6n = 10F(+/-)6.40 ± 1.216.03 ± 0.336.00 ± 0.43n = 5n = 34n = 16F(-/-)4.27 ± 0.66*4.32 ± 0.40*4.94 ± 0.77*n = 16n = 25n = 16 Open table in a new tab Increased Incidence of Neonatal Lethality for Bteb1–/– Dams—Mortality in PN1 pups was observed with greater frequency for pups born from Bteb1–/– than from WT dams. In homozygous matings, WT pups (n = 20 litters) had 4.05 ± 2.64% incidence of neonatal deaths compared with 18.43 ± 7.41% for Bteb1–/– mutants (n = 22 litters). Moreover, Bteb1+/– pups (n = 15 litters) that were born of Bteb1–/– dams died at a frequency (22.67 ± 8.87%) greater than those born of WT dams (9.09 ± 9.09; n = 11 litters) and comparable with those of Bteb1-null mutants. Bteb1 Deficiency Does Not Alter Steroid Hormone Levels and Ovulatory Capacity—Serum steroid hormone levels were determined for WT and Bteb1–/– females at 5–6 and 8–10 weeks of age. Progesterone and estrogen levels were not significantly different (p >0.1) between the two groups at both developmental ages (Fig. 3). Moreover, normal superovulation was observed in WT and Bteb1–/– mice, with comparable numbers of oocytes produced by both genotypes (WT: 41.86 ± 6.2; Bteb1–/–: 40.43 ± 5.3; n = 7 mice/genotype). Because Bteb1–/– mice also exhibited estrous cycle duration, pregnancy length, and ovarian morphology analogous to those of their WT littermates (data not shown), results suggest that the subfertility phenotype of Bteb1–/– females is a defect intrinsic to the uterus. Bteb1-deficient Mice Exhibit a Uterine Phenotype—To determine whether alterations in uterine growth might underlie, in part, the subfertility phenotype of Bteb1–/– females, uteri from WT and Bteb1–/– littermates were evaluated for differences in tissue weight, morphology, and histologic appearance as a function of age. Age-matched WT and Bteb1–/– mice exhibited increased uterine weights with age (10 weeks >6 weeks >3 weeks) (p <0.05), although across this developmental period uteri of WT mice were heavier (p <0.05) than those of Bteb1–/– (Fig. 4). Because body weight did not significantly differ between WT and Bteb1–/– females after 3 weeks of age (Fig. 2), these results suggest that the effect of Bteb1 on uterine weight is independent of somatic growth. To determine the basis of uterine hypoplasia in homozygous Bteb1 mutant mice, we evaluated WT and Bteb1–/– uteri for diameter (cross-sectional area), luminal epithelium height, and number of endometrial glands. Although endometrial gland numbers in WT uteri did not differ from those in Bteb1–/– for all ages examined, luminal epithelial height was greater (p <0.05) for WT than for Bteb1–/– at 6 weeks of age. On the other hand, uterine diameter was greater for WT than for Bteb1–/– mice at 3 (p <0.1) and 6 (p <0.05) weeks of age, although this difference was lost when the animals reached 10 weeks of age (Fig. 4). These findings suggest growth effects of Bteb1 on specific uterine compartments at particul"

The mannose-binding protein (MBP) of <i>Acanthamoeba</i> is thought to play a key role in the pathogenesis of the infection by mediating the adhesion of parasites to the host cells. We describe here the isolation and molecular cloning of <i>Acanthamoeba</i> MBP. The MBP was isolated by chromatography on the mannose affinity gel. Gel filtration experiments revealed that the <i>Acanthamoeba</i> lectin is a ∼400-kDa protein that is constituted of multiple 130-kDa subunits. Cloning and sequencing experiments indicated that the <i>Acanthamoeba</i> MBP gene is composed of 6 exons and 5 introns that span 3.6 kb of the amoeba genome and that MBP cDNA codes for a precursor protein of 833 amino acids. That the cloned cDNA encodes authentic MBP was demonstrated by showing that: (i) recombinant MBP possesses mannose binding activity, and (ii) polyclonal antibodies prepared against <i>Acanthamoeba</i> MBP bound to the recombinant protein. Sequence analysis revealed that the MBP contains a large N-terminal extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and a short C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. Despite extensive BLAST searches using the MBP sequence, no significant matches were retrieved. The most striking feature of the <i>Acanthamoeba</i> MBP sequence is the presence of a cysteine-rich region containing 14 C<i>X</i>C<i>X</i>C motifs within the extracellular domain. In summary, we have isolated, cloned, and characterized a novel MBP from <i>Acanthamoeba</i>. Because the presence of antibodies to MBP in tears provides protection against infection, the availability of the MBP cDNA sequence and rMBP should help develop: (i) a tear-based test to identify individuals who are at risk of developing the keratitis and (ii) strategies to immunize high-risk individuals."

We undertook this study to determine the mechanisms underlying the impact of dioxin on cell fate, in particular senescence that occurs in normal human cells and is considered to play important tumor suppressive function. We have previously shown that in primary human keratinocytes, dioxin attenuates senescence while retaining the proliferative capacity and represses expression of the tumor suppressors, p16INK4a and p53. Here, we show that repression of p16INK4a and p53 transcriptional activity by dioxin absolutely requires the AHR and is accompanied by promoter methylation. Furthermore, dioxin alone is sufficient to immortalize normal human keratinocytes. Our data introduce a previously unrecognized regulatory pathway, that of the AHR, that impacts senescence. More importantly, this is the first report of a tumor promoter capable of inhibiting senescence in a receptor mediated manner and introduces a novel mechanism by which this carcinogen may contribute to human malignancies.

(2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin) is an ubiquitous environmental contaminant and a highly potent tumor promoter. It has been classified as a “class I” human carcinogen by the EPA (1Kaiser J. Science. 2000; 288: 1941-1944Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Kaiser J. Science. 2000; 290: 1071Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), albeit amid considerable controversy that is primarily due to the unknown mechanisms that underlie its carcinogenic actions and a lack of sufficient epidemiological data (3Starr T.B. Environ. Health Perspect. 2003; 111: 1443-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Most effects of TCDD are mediated by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), a ligand-activated transcription factor belonging to the bHLH-PAS family. Human exposures to AHR agonists with varying potencies occur frequently due to their presence in the diet (4Schmidt C.W. Environ. Health Perspect. 2004; 112: A40-A43PubMed Google Scholar) and in the environment as a result of combustion processes such as those most recently associated with September 11, 2001 (5Edelman P. Osterloh J. Pirkle J. Caudill S.P. Grainger J. Jones R. Blount B. Calafat A. Turner W. Feldman D. Baron S. Bernard B. Lushniak B.D. Kelly K. Prezant D. Environ. Health Perspect. 2003; 111: 1906-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Upon agonist activation, the AHR translocates into the nucleus and dimerizes with ARNT (HIFβ) to modify gene regulation by binding to dioxin response elements (DREs) (6Gu Y.Z. Hogenesch J.B. Bradfield C.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 519-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). In this manner, the AHR transcriptionally up-regulates a battery of genes involved in xenobiotic metabolism and consequently aids in the elimination of these xenobiotics by decreasing their biological half-lives. Currently, the endogenous role of the AHR is controversial. On one hand, it may be a component of an adaptive response that through evolutionary pressures has evolved to aid in the elimination of xenobiotics. On the other hand, it may play an important physiological role that is independent of its actions in xenobiotic metabolism. Support for the latter idea is found in the accumulating evidence that the AHR is a regulator of the cell cycle. For example, absence of the AHR alters cell cycle progression by allowing the cells to accumulate in the G2/M phase (7Elizondo G. Fernandez-Salguero P. Sheikh M.S. Kim G.Y. Fornace A.J. Lee K.S. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 1056-1063PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the role that it plays as a DNA binding partner with ARNT, the AHR has been shown to impinge on the functions of other transcription factors, such as the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) and NF-κB, through mechanisms that presumably involve direct protein-protein interactions (8Puga A. Marlowe J. Barnes S. Chang C.Y. Maier A. Tan Z. Kerzee J.K. Chang X. Strobeck M. Knudsen E.S. Toxicology. 2002; : 181, 171-182, 177PubMed Google Scholar). Cellular senescence is characterized by a state of irreversible growth arrest in response to many stimuli. Senescence was initially associated with the phenomenon of finite proliferative capacity mediated by telomere attrition/dysfunction (replicative senescence). However, it is now clearly recognized that a number of extrinsic/intrinsic stimuli (stress-induced or premature senescence) can initiate the senescent phenotype (9Pelicci P.G. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 113: 4-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 10Ishikawa F. Cancer Sci. 2003; 94: 944-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 11Sharpless N.E. DePinho R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 113: 160-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar) and often involves the activation of both the p53 and the p16INK4a/Rb pathway, which results in the irreversible, growth-arrested state. These stimuli/stressors (i.e. telomere dysfunction, DNA damage, activated oncogenes) have in common the potential to initiate or promote neoplastic transformation, and this has led to the hypotheses that the senescent phenotype represents an inherent tumor suppressor mechanism akin to that of apoptosis. Accordingly, for a precancerous cell to achieve immortalization, a necessary first step in its journey to malignant transformation, it must be able to bypass the senescence barrier. The idea that inactivation of the senescent pathway is an important first stage in the development of a cancerous cell is also supported by the observations that many human cancers are characterized by a lack of functional cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p16INK4a and p53 expression (12Hanahan D.

Cell. 2002; 109: 335-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). Previously, we have reported that in primary human epidermal keratinocytes (HEK), TCDD repressed both the expression of the tumor suppressor proteins, p16INK4a and p53, and as well as the onset of senescence (18Ray S.S. Swanson H.I. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2003; 192: 131-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). From studies performed over the past decade, it is clear that the bHLH-PAS proteins play important roles in the detection and adaptation to environmental changes (6Gu Y.Z. Hogenesch J.B. Bradfield C.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 519-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). While members of the bHLH-PAS family have not previously been shown to be associated with the regulation of senescence, Id-1, a member of its sister family, the bHLH proteins, has been identified to play an important role in this cellular process (19Alani R.M. Hasskarl J. Grace M. Hernandez M.C. Israel M.A. Munger K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9637-9641Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The results of the current study put forth a role of the AHR in regulating the senescence program in normal human cells. We propose that inappropriate alteration of the senescence program by the AHR agonist, TCDD, is an important mechanism by which TCDD exerts its tumorigenic effects in human cells. To support this idea, we report herein that TCDD immortalizes primary keratinocytes through an AHR-mediated bypass of cellular senescence that involves hypermethylation and transcriptional silencing of p16INK4a and p53. TCDD and MNF (3′-methoxy-4′-nitroflavone) were gifts from Dr. Stephen H. Safe (Texas A & M University, College Station, TX) and Dr. Thomas A. Gaseiwicz (University of Rochester, Rochester, NY). Unless otherwise mentioned, all other chemicals were purchased from Sigma or Fischer Scientific. The 2.4-kbp fragment upstream of the p53 gene promoter (p53P1) inserted into the p220-CAT vector was obtained from Dr. David Reisman (University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI). Experiments were performed with neonatal normal HEKs (catalog number C-001-5C, Cascade Biologics) (18Ray S.S. Swanson H.I. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2003; 192: 131-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The cells were grown in Epilife medium (Cascade Biologics, Epilife® Defined Growth Supplement, 0.06 mm Ca2+). Culturing Protocol and Treatments—At 90% confluence, the medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml Penn-Strep (Invitrogen) and contained 1.5 mm Ca2+. At the same time, the cells were treated with either 0.01% Me2SO (control) or 1 nm TCDD in presence or absence of 1 μm MNF, 1 μm 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC) (Sigma) or 100 μm geldanamycin (Sigma) for the indicated time points. The medium was replenished every other day with fresh addition of the chemicals, and passage number for the HEKs was limited to four. Population Doubling Curves—Primary HEKs were grown in Epilife medium as described above in the continuous presence of either 0.01% Me2SO or 1 nm TCDD in the presence or absence of 1 μm MNF. The cells were passaged when ∼70% confluent and were cultured until they ceased to grow. Cells were counted at each passage and the population doubling (PD) determined. PD = log2 (number of cells at each subculture/number of cells initially plated). No corrections were made for the cells that failed to reinitiate growth at subculture. Cumulative PD was plotted against total time in culture to determine replicative life span. Experiments were done using cells from two different donors and viability of the plated cells was determined using trypan blue staining. One representative graph is shown. The HEKs were harvested, whole cell lysates were prepared in F-buffer, and Western blot analysis was performed as described previously under “Experimental Procedures” (18Ray S.S. Swanson H.I. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2003; 192: 131-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies used were as follows: AHR (MA1–514, ABR Affinity Bioreagents Inc. and ab2770, Abcam), p16INK4a (N-20), p53 (DO-1, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) and actin (Sigma). The HEKs were harvested at the indicated time points and total cellular RNA was extracted using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen). The RNase protection assays were performed using the human cell cycle hCC2 multiprobe template set (Pharmingen) as described previously under “Experimental Procedures” (18Ray S.S. Swanson H.I. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2003; 192: 131-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The HEKs were harvested at the indicated time points, and total cellular RNA was extracted as described before. cDNA was synthesized according to the supplier's protocol from 5 μg of RNA using random primers and SuperScript II RNase H reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). According to the supplier's protocol, 2 μl of cDNA was used for the PCR reactions using primers (Integrated DNA Technologies) described in Table I for 35 cycles. The PCR products were applied to 10% polyacrylamide gels, and the bands were visualized by staining with SYBR green (Molecular Probes). For real time RT-PCR, cDNA was synthesized as described, and the PCR reactions were carried out according to supplier's instruction using Assay-On-Demand for CYP1A1 and TaqMan® PCR Reagent for β-actin expression (Applied Biosystems). The PCR conditions were: 1) hold at 50 °C for 2 min, 2) hold at 95 °C for 10 min, and 3) denature at 95 °C for 15 s and anneal/extend at 60 °C for 1 min for 40 cycles.

Contaminating DNA was removed by subjecting the samples to RQ1 RNase free DNase (Promega) digestion. cDNA was synthesized as described above, and 2 μl of cDNA was used for the PCR reactions for 40 cycles using [α-32P]dATP and [α-32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The primers (Integrated DNA Technologies) were specifically designed to amplify regions covering parts of both introns and exons (Table I). PCR products were applied to 10% polyacrylamide gels, and gels were dried for an hour at 80 °C. Exposed PhosphorImager screens were scanned and quantitated using Image Quant 5.0 (Amersham Biosciences). siRNA was designed using siDESIGN (Dharmacon) and is depicted in Table II. The luciferase reporter regulated by the DRE was generated by inserting two copies of the annealed oligonucleotide HIS17/18 (20Swanson H.I. Yang J. J. Biol.

At 70% confluence the cells were transfected according to the supplier's protocol using the TransIT-keratinocytes protocol for DRE-regulated luciferase plasmid DNA (1 μg) and the TransIT-TKO protocol (Mirus) for siRNA (25 nm). After an overnight incubation, the cells were treated with either 0.01% Me2SO or 1 nm TCDD for an additional 24 h. The luciferase activities were measured using the Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega). For RNA analyses, the HEK cells (70% confluent) were transfected with 25 nm siRNA using TransIT-TKO and treated as described above.

Primary HEK cells were cultured as described above. Upon reaching 90% confluence, the cells were treated with 0.01% Me2SO or 1 nm TCDD in the presence or absence of 1 μm MNF or 100 μm geldanamycin (GA) for 1 h. Nuclei were isolated using the NucBuster™ Protein Extraction Kit (Novagen). The annealed oligonucleotides HIS 17 and HIS 18 (20Swanson H.I. Yang J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31657-31665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) were used as the radiolabeled probe for the electrophoretic mobility shift assays. The annealed oligonucleotides were radiolabeled with [γ-32P]ATP by end labeling with T4 polynucleotide kinase (20Swanson H.I. Yang J. J. Biol.

After incubating the mixture for 10 min at room temperature, the probe was added (100,000 cpm, ∼0.5 ng), and the mixture was incubated for an additional 10 min at room temperature. When indicated, 2 μg of either AntiAHR (Abcam) or AntiARNT (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) were added, and the samples were incubated an additional 10 min. The samples were subjected to 4% acrylamide non-denaturing gel electrophoresis using 0.5 × TBE (45 mm Tris base, 45 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) as the running buffer. The data generated from different experiments were analyzed using GraphPad Prism software using either one-way or two-way analysis of variance. TCDD-induced Decrease in the Expression of p16INK4a and p53 Requires the AHR—In our previous study, we reported that in normal human keratinocytes, TCDD attenuated the senescence program while inhibiting the expression levels of the key regulators of senescence p16INK4a and p53 (18Ray S.S. Swanson H.I. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2003; 192: 131-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To elucidate the mechanism by which TCDD exerts its effects on these tumor suppressors, we first determined whether TCDD down-regulates the expression levels of p16INK4a and p53 during senescence in a manner that requires the AHR. Toward this end, we treated preconfluent HEK cells with the AHR agonist TCDD, the AHR antagonist MNF, a flavonoid ligand that competes with TCDD for AHR binding (21Henry E.C. Kende A.S. Rucci G. Totleben M.J. Willey J.J. Dertinger S.D. Pollenz R.S. Jones J.P. Gasiewicz T.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 716-725PubMed Google Scholar), or vehicle control Me2SO and harvested them at various time points after confluence had been reached. This experimental paradigm has been shown to induce the characteristic phenotype of “stress-induced premature senescence,” i.e. high expression levels of p16INK4a and p53 and positive staining for senescence-associated β-galactosidase (18Ray S.S. Swanson H.I. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2003; 192: 131-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 22Dimri G.P. Lee X. Basile G. Acosta M. Scott G. Roskelley C. Medrano E.E. Linskens M. Rubelj I. Pereira-Smith O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9363-9367Crossref PubMed Scopus (5788) Google Scholar). To determine that MNF appropriately antagonizes the actions of TCDD in this cultured system, we monitored its ability to block the induction of TCDD of cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1), the best characterized target gene of the TCDD/AHR signaling pathway (6Gu Y.Z. Hogenesch J.B. Bradfield C.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 519-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). As expected, increasing concentrations of TCDD induced a corresponding rise in the CYP1A1 mRNA in a manner that was antagonized by MNF (Fig. 1a). Given these results, we used the optimal concentrations of MNF and TCDD (1 μm and 1 nm, respectively) to ascertain whether MNF would similarly antagonize the ability of TCDD to repress the expression levels of p16INK4a and p53. As shown, MNF blocks the ability of TCDD to repress the mRNA (see supplemental Fig. 1) and protein levels of both p16INK4a and p53 (Fig. 1b). Additionally, as determined by senescence-associated β-galactosidase staining (18Ray S.S. Swanson H.I. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2003; 192: 131-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), MNF also blocked the ability of TCDD to inhibit senescence in HEKs (data not shown). We validated our pharmacological approach by using siRNA targeted to block the expression of the AHR. The efficacy of the siAHR was first determined by using a luciferase reporter that is regulated by two copies of the DNA recognition site of the AHR/ARNT heterodimer (24Swanson H.I. Chan W.K Bradfield C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26292-26302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). As shown (Fig. 2, a and b), the presence of siAHR completely blocked the TCDD-induced luciferase activity, significantly inhibited the mRNA levels of the AHR, and compromised the ability of TCDD to induce the CYP1A1 mRNA. Experiments using siRNA were restricted to a 24-h time point, since longer incubations yielded a loss in the effectiveness of the siAHR. As expected, in the presence of siSCR, treatment with TCDD represses the mRNA levels of p16INK4a and p53; however, treatment with siAHR prevents the TCDD-induced decrease of these tumor suppressors (Fig. 2c). Thus, using both pharmacological and molecular approaches, we have demonstrated that TCDD represses the expression of p16INK4a and p53 in an AHR-dependent manner. To probe more fully the relationship between the AHR signaling pathway and the senescence program in primary HEK, we examined the impact of TCDD and MNF on the protein expression of the AHR. As shown in Fig. 3a, the protein levels of the AHR increase in a time-dependent manner. In addition, TCDD decreases the protein levels of the AHR presumably via agonist-induced degradation (25Ma Q. Baldwin K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8432-8438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), and MNF blocks the impact of TCDD on AHR levels. Further characterization revealed that MNF blocks the ability of TCDD to induce formation of the AHR/ARNT DNA binding complex (Fig. 3b, lanes 2 and 8). The specificity of the AHR/ARNT complex was determined by performing super shifts using antibodies that recognize AHR and ARNT (lanes 4 and 6). Thus, in agreement with previous studies performed in mouse hepatoma cells (21Henry E.C. Kende A.S. Rucci G. Totleben M.J. Willey J.J. Dertinger S.D. Pollenz R.S. Jones J.P. Gasiewicz T.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 716-725PubMed Google Scholar), MNF blocks the actions of TCDD in human keratinocytes by inhibiting formation of the AHR/ARNT DNA binding complex presumably by inhibiting nuclear translocation of the AHR. Further evidence supporting the idea that the AHR is required to mediate the effect of TCDD in these primary human keratinocytes is provided by experiments performed with GA. GA is a benzoquinone ansamycin that directly associates with the ATP/ADP binding site of hsp90 and thereby disrupts the heterocomplex formation (26Grenert J.P. Sullivan W.P. Fadden P. Haystead T.A. Clark J. Mimnaugh E. Krutzsch H. Ochel H.J. Schulte T.W. Sausville E. Neckers L.M. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23843-23850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Treatment with GA results in the rapid accumulation of AHR in the nucleus in a ligand-independent manner and subsequent degradation (27Song Z. Pollenz R.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 806-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 28Song Z. Pollenz R.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 597-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, c and d, treatment with GA similarly blocked the ability of TCDD to induce DNA binding of the AHR/ARNT heterodimer (compare lanes 2 and 6) and its ability to down-regulate p53 levels. Taken together, these results demonstrate a role of the AHR in inhibiting senescence and mediating the down-regulation of p16INK4a and p53 in normal human keratinocytes. TCDD-induced Repression of p16INK4a and p53 Is Mediated at the Transcriptional Level—Since the ability of TCDD to repress expression of p16INK4a and p53 occurred at both the mRNA and protein levels (18Ray S.S. Swanson H.I. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2003; 192: 131-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), we then questioned whether the repression of the mRNA levels of p53 and p16INK4a occurred at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional (e.g. processing or degradation) level. Toward this end, we used semiquantitative RT-PCR to measure the amount of nascent, unspliced pre-mRNA or hnRNA, that are not yet exposed to post-transcriptional processes (29Elferink C.J. Reiners Jr., J.J. BioTechniques. 1996; 20: 470-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, a and b, TCDD repressed the hnRNA levels of both p16INK4a and p53 indicating that TCDD exerts its effects at the transcriptional level. Interestingly, both the mRNA (18Ray S.S. Swanson H.I. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2003; 192: 131-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and hnRNA levels of p16INK4a and p53 increase in a time-dependent manner that corresponds to the onset of cellular senescence and that is blocked by TCDD. Additional studies performed using actinomycin D indicate that TCDD does not alter the mRNA stability or degradation of the p16INK4a and p53 mRNAs (30Swanson H.I. Kraner S.D. Ray S.S. Hoagland M. Thompson E.D. Zheng X. Tian Y. Lash L. Molecular Methods and Mechanisms. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ, in press2004Google Scholar) and support our conclusion here that TCDD represses the transcription of both tumor suppressor genes. From studies performed in other laboratories, it is evident that the transcriptional regulation of p16INK4a and p53 are distinct. In many cases, the regulation of p16INK4a expression is mediated either via homozygous deletion or by epigenetic alterations; however, in the case of p53 transcriptional regulation is primarily mediated by the two regulatory promoter regions, P1 and P2 (31Reisman D. Greenberg M. Rotter V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5146-5150Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To address the possibility TCDD may repress transcription of p53 via direct repression of its promoter, we performed transient transfections using a time course similar to that described in the legend to Fig. 1 and a reporter plasmid that is regulated by a 2.4-kbp fragment of the human p53 promoter. Within this promoter fragment is the P1 promoter and ∼50% of exon 1 (31Reisman D. Greenberg M. Rotter V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5146-5150Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Given that TCDD failed to alter the p53 promoter activity in these experiments (data not shown), we then turned to examining events that may regulate the promoter only within its endogenous context, i.e. the genomic DNA. Methylation Is Associated with the TCDD-induced Silencing of p16INK4a and p53—Previous studies have shown that transcriptional silencing of tumor suppressor genes in many types of human cancers occur via promoter methylation restricted to cytosines of the CpG dinucleotides in CpG islands (32Esteller M. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 5427-5440Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar). The best example of this type of regulation is p16INK4a, which is methylated in a number of primary tumors and cell lines, and thus, is thought to allow the cells to escape senescence and retain their proliferative status (15Esteller M. Herman J.G. J. Pathol. 2002; 196: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 32Esteller M. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 5427-5440Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar). As mentioned previously, the functional expression of p53 is diminished primarily by either mutations or altered regulation by p14ARF; however, in some cases promoter methylation of p53 also occurs (15Esteller M. Herman J.G. J. Pathol. 2002; 196: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 33Agirre X. Vizmanos J.L. Calasanz M.J. Garcia-Delgado M. Larrayoz M.J. Novo F.J. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 1070-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Currently, the idea that environmental contaminants, such as TCDD, may be involved in promoting DNA methylation of these gene promoters is considered to be novel, but plausible. To test the possibility that activation of the AHR signaling pathway by TCDD may repress the expression levels of p16INK4a and p53 via an increase in promoter methylation, we treated HEK cells with TCDD in the presence or absence of 5-aza-dC, a DNA hypomethylating agent that can transiently reverse the transcriptional silencing of tumor suppressor genes (34Juttermann R. Li E. Jaenisch R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11797-11801Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5a by Western blotting, 5-aza-dC completely reversed the ability of TCDD to repress expression levels of p53 at the day 6 and 8 time points. However, in the case of p16INK4a, the reversal by 5-aza-dC was only partial. To verify that the results shown in Fig. 5a are due to the repression of DNA methylation by 5-aza-dC, we performed additional experiments to directly measure the methylation status of the p16INK4a promoter. Toward this end, methylation-specific PCR (35Kubota T. Das S. Christian S.L. Baylin S.B. Herman J.G. Ledbetter D.H. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 16-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) was performed using genomic DNA obtained from Me2SO- or TCDD-treated HEK cells. As shown in Fig. 5b, on day 6 of treatment a methylated form (M) of the p16INK4a promoter was observed in the TCDD-treated samples but not in the Me2SO control. The methylated form of p16INK4a was not detected at the earlier time points (namely day 0.5 and day 2), which may indicate that treatment with TCDD induces hypermethylation rather than blocking hypomethylation. These data support the hypothesis that transcriptional repression by TCDD involves promoter methylation. Treatment with TCDD Immortalizes Normal Human Keratinocytes—As stated previously, high expression levels of p16INK4a and p53 are required for maintaining the senescence program. These proteins regulate the proliferative barrier toward immortality often termed as “crisis” and thereby limit the replicative life span of normal human cells. Hence, we investigated whether the TCDD-induced repression in the levels of these proteins circumvents these regulatory roles and allows the cells to bypass senescence and, subsequently, become immortal. Toward this end, we allowed the cells to proliferate in the constant presence of Me2SO, TCDD, or MNF, passaging them as they reached ∼70% confluence to allow determination of cumulative PD. As shown in Fig. 6a, primary HEKs cultured under normal conditions (i.e. untreated) or with Me2SO ceased dividing after ∼27 PD. However, in the presence of TCDD, the cells continued to divide for at least 50 PD (>80 PD total) beyond their normal limit/threshold. Immortalization has previously been defined as an event that extends the life span of the primary cells by a minimum of 50 PD (36Dickson M.A. Hahn W.C. Ino Y. Ronfard V. Wu J.Y. Weinberg R.A. Louis D.N. Li F.P. Rheinwald J.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1436-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). As expected, MNF alone did not significantly alter the life span of these cells but blocked the TCDD induced bypass of senescence, again indicating a role of the AHR in these TCDD-induced events. We then determined whether immortalization of the normal human keratinocytes cultured in these conditions invoked a down-regulation of p16IN4a and p53 similar to that observed during our previously described protocol (i.e. during senescence induced by high calcium and high cell density, Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). As shown in Fig. 6b, treatment with TCDD using this experimental paradigm decreased the expression levels of both p16IN4a and p53. However, comparison of the mRNA expression patterns revealed that the impact of TCDD on these two gene products is distinct. With respect to p16INK4a, TCDD induced a progressive decrease in its expression levels during entire time course. In contrast, the TCDD-induced expression patterns of p53 were similar to that of the Rb proteins (i.e. Rb, p107, and p130) and p27KIP1. Here, the expression levels were indistinguishable from that of the Me2SO control until passage 7 (P7) but plummeted at some time point after the loss in viability of Me2SO-treated cells (i.e. between P7 and P16). As shown in Fig. 6b, p14ARF, which regulates the p53 protein levels via regulation of the MDM2 pathway, was also found to be down-regulated by TCDD under the current experimental paradigm. Our preliminary examinations have thus far failed to detect a TCDD-induced increase in hTERT expression. To determine whether the expression of AHR or its transcriptional activity was altered during TCDD-induced immortalization of the primary human keratinocytes, we performed RT-PCR to measure the mRNA levels of AHR and its target gene, CYP1A1. As shown in Fig. 6c, although the AHR mRNA expression was not significantly altered during this process, there was a steady and time-dependent increase in the CYP1A1 mRNA levels. These results indicate that the transcriptional activity of the AHR may be necessary for the bypass of senescence observed in these normal HEKs. To summarize, we report that normal human keratinocytes exposed to TCDD alone become immortalized in an AHR-dependent manner, presumably through the suppression of the key initiators of senescence, p16INK4a and p53. Additionally, we have shown that this suppression is accompanied by promoter methylation. Although from the slope of the graph (36Dickson M.A. Hahn W.C. Ino Y. Ronfard V. Wu J.Y. Weinberg R.A. Louis D.N. Li F.P. Rheinwald J.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1436-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar) in Fig. 6 it can be predicted that treatment with TCDD alone is sufficient for immortalization, the requirement for additional mutations cannot be ruled out. While senescence has been shown to be induced by a number of chemical agents, i.e. those involved in chemotherapies, to our knowledge, this is the first report of a known tumor promoter inhibiting this important cancer preventive pathway."

Like full-length MASP-2, it forms Ca2+-dependent complexes with mannan-binding lectin (MBL) and L-ficolin. The x-ray structure of human MAp19 was solved to a resolution of 2.5 Å. It shows a head to tail homodimer held together by interactions between the CUB1 module of one monomer and the EGF module of its counterpart. A Ca2+ ion bound to each EGF module stabilizes the dimer interfaces. A second Ca2+ ion is bound to the distal end of each CUB1 module, through six ligands contributed by Glu52, Asp60, Asp105, Ser107, Asn108, and a water molecule. Compared with its counterpart in human C1s, the N-terminal end of the MAp19 CUB1 module contains a 7-residue extension that forms additional inter-monomer contacts. To identify the residues involved in the interaction of MAp19 with MBL and L-ficolin, point mutants were generated and their binding ability was determined using surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy. Six mutations at Tyr59, Asp60, Glu83, Asp105, Tyr106, and Glu109 either strongly decreased or abolished interaction with both MBL and L-ficolin.

Studies performed over the past decade have led to the discovery of a novel route of complement activation termed the lectin pathway, which is increasingly recognized as an important component of innate antimicrobial host defense. This pathway is triggered by oligomeric lectins that recognize arrays of neutral carbohydrates on the surface of pathogens and share the ability to associate with enzymes called mannan-binding lectin-associated serine proteases (MASPs) 1The abbreviations used are: MASP, mannan-binding lectin-associated serine protease; CUB, module originally identified in complement proteins C1r/C1s, Uegf, and bone morphogenetic protein; EGF, epidermal growth factor; MBL, mannan-binding lectin.1The abbreviations used are: MASP, mannan-binding lectin-associated serine protease; CUB, module originally identified in complement proteins C1r/C1s, Uegf, and bone morphogenetic protein; EGF, epidermal growth factor; MBL, mannan-binding lectin.

All MASPs exhibit modular structures homologous to those of C1r and C1s, the proteases of the C1 complex of complement, with an N-terminal CUB module (11Bork P. Beckmann G. J. Mol.

MASP-1 and MASP-3 are alternative splicing products of the MASP1/3 gene and share identical CUB1-EGF-CUB2-CCP1-CCP2 segments, but comprise different serine protease domains (10Dahl M.R. Thiel S.

In the same way, alternative splicing of the MASP-2 gene generates MBL-associated protein 19 (MAp19), a nonenzymic protein comprising the N-terminal CUB1-EGF segment of MASP-2 prolonged by four unique residues (14Stover C.M.

Likewise, the MASPs and MAp19 each individually form Ca2+-dependent complexes with MBL and L-ficolin. The binding involves primarily the N-terminal CUB1-EGF moiety of each protein, but is strengthened by the CUB2 module, which decreases the dissociation rate constant (koff) of the interaction (17Cseh S.

The structures of the CUB1-EGF-CUB2 segment of rat MASP-2 and of the CUB1-EGF domain of human C1s have recently been solved by x-ray crystallography, revealing homologous homodimeric structures (21Feinberg H.

We now report the crystal structure of human MAp19 and the identification by site-directed mutagenesis of its interaction site with MBL and L-ficolin. Proteins—MBL and L-ficolin were purified from human serum as described by Zundel et al. (18Zundel S. Cseh S. Lacroix M. Dahl M.R. Matsushita M. Andrieu J.-P. Schwaeble W.J. Jensenius J.C. Fujita T. Arlaud G.J. Thielens N.M. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 4342-4350Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and Cseh et al. (17Cseh S. Vera L. Matsushita M. Fujita T. Arlaud G.J. Thielens N.M. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 5735-5743Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), respectively. Recombinant wild-type MAp19 and its variants were expressed using a baculovirus/insect cell system. All mutants were secreted in the culture medium, with yields ranging from 3 to 6 μg/ml, similar to those observed for wild-type MAp19. All variants were purified from the cell culture supernatants by anion-exchange chromatography on a Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column followed by gel filtration in the presence of Ca2+ ions on a TSK G3000 SWG column, as described previously for wild-type MAp19 (16Thielens N.M. Cesh S. Thiel S. Vorup-Jensen T. Rossi V. Jensenius J.C. Arlaud G.J. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 5068-5077Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The concentrations of the recombinant proteins were determined using absorption coefficients (A1%1cm at 280 nm) of 11.4 (Y59A and Y106A mutants) and 12.0 (wild-type MAp19 and all other mutants), calculated by the method of Gill and von Hippel (23Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5048) Google Scholar). Molecular masses, calculated from the amino acid sequences, were as follows: wild-type MAp19, 19,087 Da; E78Q, D81N, and E133Q mutants, 19,086 Da; E58A, E83A, and E109A mutants, 19,029 Da; Y59A and Y106A mutants, 18,995 Da; MAp19 R41A, 19,002 Da; MAp19 H55A, 19,041 Da; MAp19 D60A, 19,043 Da. Site-directed Mutagenesis—The expression plasmids coding for all MAp19 mutants were generated using the QuikChange™ XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The pFastBac1/MAp19 expression plasmid coding for wild-type MAp19 (16Thielens N.M. Cesh S. Thiel S. Vorup-Jensen T. Rossi V. Jensenius J.C. Arlaud G.J. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 5068-5077Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) was used as a template. Mutagenic oligonucleotides were purchased from MWG-BIOTECH (Courtaboeuf, France). The sequences of all mutants were confirmed by double-stranded DNA sequencing (Genome Express, Grenoble, France). Chemical Characterization of the Recombinant Proteins—Mass spectrometry analyses were performed using the matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization technique on a Voyager Elite XL instrument (Perseptive Biosystems, Cambridge, MA), under conditions described previously (24Lacroix M. Rossi V. Gaboriaud C. Chevallier S. Jaquinod M. Thielens N.M. Gagnon J. Arlaud G.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6270-6282Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Circular Dichroism—CD measurements were performed on a JASCO J-810 spectropolarimeter using a 1.0-mm path length quartz cell. Spectra were recorded over the 200–320 nm range at 0.5-nm intervals at a scan speed of 50 nm/min and corrected for the contribution of the buffer (145 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 50 mm triethanolamine hydrochloride, pH 7.4). The concentrations of the MAp19 variants were as follows: wild-type, 17.2 μm; Y59A, 17.2 μm; E83A, 13 μm; D105G, 17.2 μm; Y106A, 17.6 μm; E109A, 10.1 μm. Crystallization and Data Collection—Recombinant MAp19 was concentrated to 2.5 mg/ml in 145 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 50 mm triethanolamine HCl, pH 7.4. Crystals suitable for x-ray data collection were obtained at 20 °C by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method by mixing equal volumes of the protein solution and a reservoir solution composed of 3% (w/v) PEG 8000 and 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5. They were transferred to a cryoprotectant solution containing 15% (w/v) PEG 8000, 21.75% glycerol, and 0.1 m Tris-HCl, and then flash cooled in liquid nitrogen. A native data set indexed in the space group P43212 was measured at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) beamline BM14 to a resolution of 2.50 Å. The images were processed and the reflections scaled using the program XDS (25Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3225) Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab Structure Determination and Refinement—The structure of MAp19 was determined using the molecular replacement method. The rotational and translational searches were carried out using the program AMORE (26Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5028) Google Scholar). Whereas initial searches using the human C1s CUB1-EGF structure (22Gregory L.A. Thielens N.M. Arlaud G.J. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Gaboriaud C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32157-32164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) were unsuccessful, a molecular replacement solution was obtained using the CUB1-EGF fragment of rat MASP-2 in the dimeric form (Protein Data Bank accession code 1NT0) (21Feinberg H. Uitdehaag J.C. Davies J.M. Wallis R. Drickamer K. Weiss W.I. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2348-2359Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Rigid body refinement with the program CNS (27Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16957) Google Scholar) further improved the orientation and position of each of the domains of the search model. Additional refinement of the model was carried out with CNS and model rebuilding was performed using the graphics program O (28Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13009) Google Scholar). The quality of the map allowed construction of 333 residues of a total of 340 in the asymmetric unit. Residues Thr1 (molecule A), Thr1–Leu2 (molecule B), and Ser169–Leu170 (molecules A and B) are disordered. Residue Pro21 is in the cis configuration. The atomic coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under the code 1SZB. Modeling of the MBL Collagen-like Triple Helix—The human MBL collagen-like segment (positions 36–63) was modeled using the graphics program O (28Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13009) Google Scholar). Regional differences based on the helical propensity of residues, as established from statistical analysis of collagen-like structures (30Rainey J.K. Goh M.C. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2748-2754Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), were included in the model. The template Protein Data Bank file corresponding to imino-rich parameters (30Rainey J.K. Goh M.C. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2748-2754Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) was used for modeling most of the triple helix, except for segments 45–50 and 54–56, where the alternative template file designed for imino-deficient segments (30Rainey J.K. Goh M.C. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2748-2754Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) was used. The graphics program O (28Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13009) Google Scholar) was then used to search for a plausible model of MAp19 interaction with two modeled MBL triple helices. Although different sets of MAp19 orientations were tried initially, only one major hypothetical mode of interaction was found to be fully compatible with both the present mutagenesis data and previously published experimental information (see “Discussion”). Surface Plasmon Resonance Spectroscopy and Data Evaluation—Surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy analyses were performed using a BIAcore 3000 instrument (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). MBL and L-ficolin/P35 were immobilized on the surface of a CM5 sensor chip (BIAcore AB) using the amine coupling chemistry as described previously (17Cseh S. Vera L. Matsushita M. Fujita T. Arlaud G.J. Thielens N.M. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 5735-5743Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Binding of the wild-type and mutant MAp19 species was measured over 16,000 resonance units of immobilized L-ficolin or 9,000 resonance units of immobilized MBL, at a flow rate of 20 μl/min in 145 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 50 mm triethanolamine hydrochloride, pH 7.4, containing 0.005% surfactant P20 (BIAcore AB). Equivalent volumes of each MAp19 sample were injected in parallel over a surface with immobilized bovine serum albumin to serve as blank sensorgrams for subtraction of the bulk refractive index background. Regeneration of the surfaces was achieved by injection of 10 μl of 1 m NaCl, 20 mm EDTA. Data were analyzed by global fitting to a 1:1 Langmuir binding model of both the association and dissociation phases for several concentrations simultaneously, using the BIAevaluation 3.1 software (BIAcore AB). The apparent equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) were calculated from the ratio of the dissociation and association rate constants (koff/kon). Each MAp19 variant was analyzed at six different concentrations, ranging from 5 to 60 nm for wild-type MAp19 and all mutants except D60A and E83A (25–250 nm), E109A (50–500 nm), Y59A, D105G, and Y106A (100–1200 nm). Overall Structure—Human MAp19 was produced in a baculovirus/insect cell expression system as described previously (16Thielens N.M. Cesh S. Thiel S. Vorup-Jensen T. Rossi V. Jensenius J.C. Arlaud G.J. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 5068-5077Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Mass spectrometry analysis of the recombinant protein yielded a value of 19,088 ± 9 Da, in full agreement with the amino acid sequence (calculated mass: 19,087.1 Da). The crystal structure of MAp19 was solved by molecular replacement using the rat MASP-2 CUB1-EGF structure (21Feinberg H. Uitdehaag J.C. Davies J.M. Wallis R. Drickamer K. Weiss W.I. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2348-2359Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) as a search model, and refined to 2.5-Å resolution. The final Rwork and Rfree factors are 0.261 and 0.316, respectively, and the refined model has satisfactory stereochemistry (Table I). As expected from previous sedimentation velocity analyses (16Thielens N.M. Cesh S. Thiel S. Vorup-Jensen T. Rossi V. Jensenius J.C. Arlaud G.J. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 5068-5077Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), MAp19 associates as a Ca2+-dependent homodimer (Fig. 1). The two monomers interact in a head to tail manner, through major contacts between the CUB1 module of one monomer and the EGF module of its counterpart. The dimer contains four Ca2+ ions, one at each CUB1-EGF interface (site I) and one bound to the distal end of each CUB1 module (site II) (Fig. 1A). The structure has a length of 95 Å and a width of 20–45 Å. Overall, the assembly is reminiscent of those observed for the CUB1-EGF segments of human C1s and rat MASP-2 (21Feinberg H. Uitdehaag J.C. Davies J.M. Wallis R. Drickamer K. Weiss W.I. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2348-2359Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 22Gregory L.A. Thielens N.M. Arlaud G.J. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Gaboriaud C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32157-32164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, a detailed comparison of the three structures reveals differences in the relative positioning of their CUB1 and EGF modules. Thus, superimposition of the MAp19 and C1s monomeric structures on their CUB1 domains reveals extensive displacement of the EGF modules, resulting in a distance of ∼10 Å between their distal ends, corresponding to a rotation of ∼25° about the long axis of the CUB domains (Fig. 1C). Similarly, a displacement of EGF modules is observed when the human MAp19 and rat MASP-2 monomers are compared, although the rotation angle is only about 14° in that case. In both instances, the flexibility originates from a hinge located near Glu122, at the boundary between the CUB1 and EGF modules (Fig. 1C). Additional differences are observed when the dimeric structures are compared. Thus, there are significant variations in the relative positioning of the CUB1 module of one monomer and the EGF module of its counterpart, with rotation angles of 15–19° between MAp19 and the other two dimers. Interestingly, in contrast to the C1s structure (22Gregory L.A. Thielens N.M. Arlaud G.J. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Gaboriaud C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32157-32164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), MAp19 does not feature a groove in the region where the four modules meet, the corresponding space being partly filled by loops 10 of both EGF modules (Fig. 1B). A comparison in this respect with the rat MASP-2 CUB1-EGF dimer is not possible, because both loops 10 are disordered in the structure (21Feinberg H. Uitdehaag J.C. Davies J.M. Wallis R. Drickamer K. Weiss W.I. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2348-2359Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The CUB1 Module and Ca2+-binding Site II—The MAp19 CUB1 module is organized in two four-stranded β-sheets, each made of anti-parallel strands, providing further evidence that this topology, also observed in the corresponding module of human C1s and rat MASP-2, defines a particular CUB domain subset distinct from the plasma spermadhesins (31Romero A. Romao J.J. Varela P.F. Kölln L. Dias J.M. Carvalho A.L. Sanz L. Topfer-Petersen E. Calvete J.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 5: 458-463Google Scholar). As expected from sequence homologies, the MAp19 CUB1 module is structurally closer to its counterpart in rat MASP-2 (root mean square deviation = 0.56 Å, based on 106 Cα atoms) than to the C1s CUB1 module (root mean square deviation = 0.94 Å, based on 99 Cα atoms). Compared with C1s, MAp19 contains a 7-residue extension at its N-terminal end (Figs. 1C and 2). Except for Thr1 of molecule A and residues Thr1 and Leu2 of molecule B, the corresponding segments are well defined in the structure and closely interact with each other. As illustrated in Fig. 1B, the interactions mainly involve van der Waals contacts between residues Pro5, Trp7, Pro8, Glu9, and Pro10 of molecule A and residues Leu3, Gly4, Pro8, Glu9, Pro10, and Val11 of molecule B. Other interactions are mediated by Trp7 of molecule A, which forms a hydrogen bond with the main chain carbonyl group of Glu9 of molecule B, and additional van der Waals contacts with residues Ala36, Pro37, and Ala121 of molecule B. Remarkably, these interactions are asymmetrical and the two N-terminal segments exhibit quite different conformations in the structure (Fig. 1B). A Ca2+ ion (site II) is bound to the distal end of each CUB1 module (Fig. 1). In molecule A, the Ca2+ ion is coordinated by six oxygen ligands, namely one of the side chain oxygens of Glu52, Asp60, and Asp105, the main chain carbonyl oxygen of Ser107, the side chain carbonyl oxygen of Asn108, and a water molecule (Fig. 3). The bond distances are in average 2.4 Å, consistent with the value determined for known Ca2+-binding sites (32Harding M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1432-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The coordination involves the same protein ligands in molecule B, but the water molecule is missing. A comparison with the homologous site previously observed in C1s (22Gregory L.A. Thielens N.M. Arlaud G.J. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Gaboriaud C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32157-32164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), reveals several significant differences. (i) The residues equivalent to Ser107 and Asn108 of MAp19 are not Ca2+ ligands in C1s. (ii) The C1s residue Asp53 contributes two ligands instead of one for the homologous residue Asp60 of MAp19. (iii) Whereas Asp105 of MAp19 binds Ca2+ through its side chain, its counterpart Asp98 in C1s binds through its main chain carbonyl. (iv) Two water molecules are present in the C1s Ca2+ binding site. On the other hand, as observed in C1s, the Ca2+ ion is the central element of a network of interactions that connect together loops L3, L5, and L9, thereby extensively stabilizing the distal end of the MAp19 CUB1 module. In this respect, it is interesting to note that Tyr24 is H-bonded to the side chain carboxyl of Asp60 and the main chain nitrogen of Glu52, and thereby stabilizes loop L3 in the same way as does its counterpart Tyr17 in C1s (22Gregory L.A. Thielens N.M. Arlaud G.J. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Gaboriaud C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32157-32164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Ca2+-binding Site I—The MAp19 EGF module has a -fold similar to that described for other EGF-like modules (12Campbell I.D. Bork P. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 385-392Crossref Scopus (331) Google Scholar), with one major and one minor anti-parallel double-stranded β-sheets (Fig. 1, A and B). Loop 10, which is disordered in the rat MASP-2 structure (21Feinberg H. Uitdehaag J.C. Davies J.M. Wallis R. Drickamer K. Weiss W.I. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2348-2359Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), is structurally well defined in MAp19 and exhibits a rather extended conformation (Fig. 1B), different from that of the corresponding loop of C1s (22Gregory L.A. Thielens N.M. Arlaud G.J. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Gaboriaud C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32157-32164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The remainder of the MAp19, C1s, and rat MASP-2 EGF modules show root mean square deviation values of 0.61–0.69 Å, indicative of high structural homology. The Ca2+ ion bound to each EGF module (site I) is coordinated by seven oxygen ligands, including a water molecule and six ligands provided by the EGF module, namely one of the side chain oxygens of Asp123 and Glu126, the side chain carbonyl of Asn143, and the main chain carbonyl of Ile124, His144, and Gly147. These residues are strictly homologous to those providing Ca2+ ligands in C1s. In contrast, as discussed previously (22Gregory L.A. Thielens N.M. Arlaud G.J. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Gaboriaud C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32157-32164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), the Ca2+-binding site observed in the rat MASP-2 structure only involves five coordination ligands (21Feinberg H. Uitdehaag J.C. Davies J.M. Wallis R. Drickamer K. Weiss W.I. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2348-2359Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). As observed in the C1s structure (22Gregory L.A. Thielens N.M. Arlaud G.J. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Gaboriaud C. J. Biol.

During the healing course of gastric erosion, Reg expression is highly increased in the enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells surrounding the ulcer crater, suggesting its role as a regulator of gastric mucosal regeneration. However, there has been no direct in vivo evidence of a growth-promoting role of Reg for the gastric mucosal cells. In the current study, Reg-transgenic mice were created and gastric mucosa were analysed for histological changes. Transgenic mice showed a marked increase in the thickness of the fundic mucosa. Anti-proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) staining of the fundic mucosa demonstrated the enlargement of the proliferating neck zone and the lower PCNA-negative zone. Histological analysis employing antibodies against cell-type markers revealed expansion of the chief cell and parietal cell populations and no change in the number of surface mucus-producing cells, ECL cells, or G cells. In conclusion, Reg has a growth-promoting effect on gastric progenitor cells and an activity to direct the differentiation of the cells into chief cell and parietal cell lineages. This was in contrast to other factors, all of which had been shown to drive differentiation towards mucus producing cells in vivo. In the injured gastric mucosa, Reg may play a unique and important part in the reconstruction of the properly organized mucosal architecture."
https://openalex.org/W2071941582,"The Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway is an essential cascade for mediating normal functions of different cytokines in the development of the hematopoietic and immune systems. Chronic exposure to arsenic has been found to cause immunotoxicity and has been associated with the suppression of hematopoiesis (anemia and leukopenia). Here, we report the novel finding of arsenic-mediated inactivation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway by its direct interaction with JAK tyrosine kinase. Pretreatment with sodium arsenite strongly inhibited IL-6-inducible STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation in HepG2 cells and did not affect its serine phosphorylation. As a result, sodium arsenite completely abolished STAT activity-dependent expression of suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS). Both cellular and subcelluar experiments showed that the inhibition of JAK-STAT signaling resulted from JAK tyrosine kinase's direct interaction with arsenite, and that arsenic's suppression of JAK tyrosine kinase activity also occurred in the interferon gamma (IFNgamma) pathway. The ligand-independent inhibition by arsenic indicates that JAK was the direct target of arsenic action. Other inflammatory stimulants, stress agents, and metal cadmium failed to induce similar effects on the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 as arsenic does. Our experiments also revealed that arsenic inactivation of the JAK-STAT pathway occurred independent of arsenic activation of MAP kinases. Taken together, our findings indicate that arsenic directly inhibits JAK tyrosine kinase activity and suggest that this direct interference in the JAK-STAT pathway may play a role in arsenic-associated pathogenesis."

We identified a novel protein, MLF1-interacting protein (MLF1IP), that specifically associates with MLF1 by yeast two-hybrid analysis and in pulldown assays, and colocalizes with it in both the nuclei and cytoplasm of cells. The MLF1IP gene locus is at chromosome 4q35.1 and is composed of 14 exons spanning 75.8 kb of genomic DNA. The MLF1IP cDNA encodes a 46-kDa protein that contains two bipartite and two classical nuclear localization signals, two nuclear receptor-binding motifs (LXXLL), two leucine zippers, two PEST residues and several potential phosphorylation sites. MLF1IP transcripts are expressed in a variety of tissues (e.g. fetal liver, bone marrow, thymus and testis). MLF1IP appears to be a lineage-specific gene whose expression is confined exclusively to the CFU-E erythroid precursor cells, but not in mature erythrocytes. These observations, together with previous data demonstrating a role for MLF1 in suppressing red cell maturation, suggest a possible role for MLF1IP and MLF1 deregulation in the genesis of erythroleukemias."
https://openalex.org/W2097948608,"Cbf1p is a basic-helix-loop-helix-zipper protein of Saccharomyces cerevisiae required for the function of centromeres and MET gene promoters, where it binds DNA via the consensus core motif CACRTG (R = A or G). At MET genes Cbf1p appears to function in both activator recruitment and chromatin-remodeling. Cbf1p has been implicated in the regulation of other genes, and CACRTG motifs are common in potential gene regulatory DNA. A recent genome-wide location analysis showed that the majority of intergenic CACGTG palindromes are bound by Cbf1p. Here we tested whether all potential Cbf1p binding motifs in the yeast genome are likely to be bound by Cbf1p using chromatin immunoprecipitation. We also tested which of the motifs are actually functional by assaying for Cbf1p-dependent chromatin remodeling. We show that Cbf1p binding and activity is restricted to palindromic CACGTG motifs in promoter-proximal regions. Cbf1p does not function through CACGTG motifs that occur in promoter-distal locations within coding regions nor where CACATG motifs occur alone except at centromeres. Cbf1p can be made to function at promoter-distal CACGTG motifs by overexpression, suggesting that the concentration of Cbf1p is normally limiting for binding and is biased to gene regulatory DNA by interactions with other factors.

Saccharomyces cerevisiae centromere binding factor 1, Cbf1p (also known as Cpf1, CBP1, and CP1), is a dimeric DNA-binding protein of the basic-helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper family.

RTCACRTG. Deletion of the CBF1 gene or deletion of CDEI motifs from centromeric DNA led to similar defects in mitotic and meiotic centromere function, indicating that Cbf1p is an important component of the centromere-kinetochore complex (9Ortiz J.

Although the precise role of Cbf1p at the centromere is not yet understood, it is known to interact with other protein components of the kinetochore complex to form a compact nucleosome-based structure (11Bloom K.S.

The CACRTG motif is not restricted to centromeric DNA but also occurs in one or several copies in the regulatory DNA of almost every gene encoding a protein involved in the methionine biosynthetic pathway (the MET genes). Loss of Cbf1p function leads to methionine auxotrophy, indicating that Cbf1p also functions as a transcription factor (16Thomas D. Cherest H. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3292-3298Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 17Baker R.E. Masison D.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2458-2467Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 18Cai M. Davis R.W.

The role of Cbf1p at MET gene promoters has turned out to be quite complicated and appears to involve two separate functionalities. First, Cbf1p acts in the recruitment of Met4p, the MET gene transcriptional activator. Met4p is a basic-zipper protein that is a target for regulation through S-adenosyl methionine concentration-dependent ubiquitinylation via the Cdc34p·SCFMet30p complex (21Patton E.E. Peyraud C. Rouillon A. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Tyers M. Thomas D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1613-1624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Kaiser P. Flick K. Wittenberg C. Reed S.I.

Cell. 2002; 10: 69-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). On its own Met4p will not bind DNA (24Kuras L. Barbey R. Thomas D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2441-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). At the MET16 promoter, Met4p is recruited as part of a co-operatively bound complex consisting of Met4p, the basic-helix-loop-helix factor Met28p, and Cbf1p, which binds to a single CACGTG motif (24Kuras L. Barbey R. Thomas D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2441-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 25Kuras L. Cherest H. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Thomas D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2519-2529Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In the absence of Cbf1p the complex does not form at the promoter, and the MET16 gene cannot be activated. Interestingly, Cbf1p is not absolutely required for regulation of all MET genes (20Kuras L. Thomas D. FEBS Lett. 1995; 367: 15-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This apparent paradox has been resolved by experiments showing that recruitment of Met4p to different MET genes requires an overlapping set of context-dependent factors, which only sometimes include and/or require Cbf1p (26Blaiseau P.L. Isnard A.D. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Thomas D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3640-3648Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 27Blaiseau P.L. Thomas D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6327-6336Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The second role of Cbf1p at MET gene promoters appears to be in ensuring the correct position of promoter-proximal nucleosomes; in the absence of Cbf1p, changes in cleavage with micrococcal nuclease (MNase) are observed at MET gene promoters that are consistent with alteration in the translational position of two to three nucleosomes packaging MET gene regulatory DNA (28Kent N.A. Tsang J.S.H. Crowther D.J. Mellor J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5229-5241Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 29O'Connell K.F. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Baker R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1879-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This function is likely to involve the recruitment of the chromatin remodeling ATPase Isw1p (30Moreau J.-L. Lee M. Mahachi N. Vary J. Mellor J. Tsukiyama T. Goding C.R. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1609-1620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Although the chromatin-remodeling function of Cbf1p is not absolutely required for MET gene activation, it appears to influence the kinetics of activation (20Kuras L. Thomas D. FEBS Lett. 1995; 367: 15-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Although the ubiquitous presence of CACRTG motifs at centromeres and MET gene promoters is striking, the motif is widespread throughout the yeast genome, occurring in both intergenic regions and within coding DNA. The haploid yeast genome contains 4820 potential Cbf1p binding CACRTG core motifs, of which 953 are CACGTG palindromes that show 10-fold higher binding affinity for Cbf1p than CACATG in vitro (3Wilmen A. Pick H. Niedenthal R.K. Sen-Gupta M. Hegemann J-H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2791-2800Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Previous work has concentrated on potential Cbf1p binding motifs that occur in a gene regulatory context; a recent series of genome-wide protein localization experiments tested the binding of a variety of transcription factors to yeast promoter regions and suggested that 83% of intergenic CACGTG palindromes were likely to be bound by Cbf1p (31Lee T.I. Rinaldi N.J. Robert F. Odom D.T. Bar-Joseph Z. Gerber G.K. Hannett N.M. Harbison C.T. Thompson C.M. Simon I. Zeitlinger J. Jennings E.G. Murray H.L. Gordon D.B. Ren B. Wyrick J.J. Tagne J.B.

Mutation of the CBF1 gene or mutation of potential CACRTG binding motifs in the regulatory DNA of the GAL2, TRP1, CYT1, PGK, RPL45, QCR8, and GSH1 genes leads to perturbation of transcriptional regulation (19Mellor J.

In addition, altered patterns of nuclease accessibility in chromatin consistent with changes in nucleosome position have been reported in association with Cbf1p binding at the TRP1 and QCR8 promoters (19Mellor J.

Yeast. 1993; 9: 847-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), suggesting that chromatin remodeling is a general function of DNA-bound Cbf1p. The experiments above suggest that Cbf1p could be associated with a large number of yeast loci. In this work we have attempted to investigate which CACRTG motifs in the yeast genome are bound by Cbf1p and, more importantly, which motifs support Cbf1p-dependent chromatin remodeling. In particular, we have sought to answer the question of whether Cbf1p is required for correct nucleosome positioning at every potential chromosomal binding site (which would suggest a structural function for the protein throughout the genome) or whether Cbf1p is biased to gene regulatory sequences (which would suggest a general function as a transcription factor). We, therefore, chose to examine a panel of yeast loci that contain CACRTG motifs in various combinations and contexts using chromatin immunoprecipitation and in vivo nuclease digestion methods. By choosing a mixture of loci, some with known association to Cbf1p and some at random from one arm of a yeast chromosome, we expect that our results should be representative of the yeast genome as whole. Yeast Strains and Microbiological Culture—Epitope tagging was performed by the gene replacement technology described in Longtine et al. (39Longtine M.S. McKenzie A.D. Demarini J. Shah N.G. Wach A.

Isw1p-Myc, which is fully functional in chromatin remodeling, is described in more detail in Kent et al. (40Kent N.A. Karabetsou N. Politis P.K. Mellor J.

For chromatin analysis in Figs. 2, 3, 4 the wild-type and mutant strains were of the DBY745 background (MATα, ade1-100, leu2-3, leu2-112, ura3-5).

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)1 experiments and chromatin analyses were performed with yeast grown in 100 ml of rich media (1% w/v Bacto-peptone, 1% w/v yeast extract, and 2% w/v d-glucose). Yeast were grown at 29 °C, and cells were harvested at densities of between 1.0 × 107 and 2.5 × 107 cells/ml (midlog/pre-diauxic shift). For Cbf1p overexpression experiments, yeast were grown overnight in 100 ml of synthetic complete medium supplemented with the appropriate amino acids and either 2% w/v d-glucose or 2% w/v d-galactose.Fig. 3A CACGTG pGAL::CBF1 palindrome deep within the FUN30-coding region does not show a Cbf1p-dependent chromatin structure unless Cbf1p is overexpressed.A, indirect end-label analysis of in vivo chromatin MNase accessibility at FUN30.

After purification, IP and NoAb DNA samples were re-suspended in 150 μl for Cbf1p-Myc experiments and in 40 μl for Isw1p-Myc experiments. 5-μl aliquots of DNA were analyzed by semiquantitative PCR (20-μl reactions) using primer pairs that amplify ∼300-bp products. DNA from input chromatin (see Fig. 1; three TOT samples) represents 0.5% of the total input with 1:10 and 1:20 dilutions. PCR products were fractionated on 1.5% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide and photographed in negative. The samples used for the ChIP analysis in Fig. 1 were matched, i.e. they all came from the same immunoprecipitation. ChIP primer pairs amplified DNA from the following nucleotide positions relative to the start codon of the quoted coding region or CDEI for centromeres: CLB2 (-850 to -551); CEN6 (-90 to +210); CEN3 (-90 to +210); MET17 (-512 to -212); GAL2 (-600 to -300); DRS2 (-250 to +50); PSK1 (-737 to -437); GSH1 (-584 to -285); SHU1 (+7 to +307); GDH3 (+3 to +300); FUN30 (+1475 to +1775); ERV46 (+200 to +504); GAL3 (-400 to -100); MET16 (-300 to +1). Chromatin Indirect End-label Analysis—Chromatin was digested with MNase in permeabilized yeast cells according to the general methods (42Kent N.A. Bird L.E. Mellor J Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4653-4654Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 43Wu L. Winston F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4230-4234Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). All chromatin samples contained DNA from 2.0 × 108 cells and were digested with 75, 150, and 300 units/ml of MNase for 3–5 min at 37 °C. Equivalent amounts of purified genomic DNA were digested with 10 units/ml MNase at room temperature for 30–50 s to provide “naked” DNA controls. Further samples of purified DNA were cleaved with restriction enzymes and pooled in various combinations to provide marker digests. MNase-treated samples and marker mixes were digested to completion with appropriate restriction enzymes and analyzed by indirect end-labeling (44Wu C. Nature. 1980; 286: 854-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). DNAs were separated on 1.5% agarose gels and Southern-blotted to nylon membranes (MSI/Osmonics). Probes were derived from DNA fragments amplified by PCR from yeast genomic DNA. PCR products were typically designed to be 1.0–1.5 kilobases in size and were then digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes to generate the required end-label. End-label probes were gel-purified before radiolabeling by random priming (Stratagene). Hybridizations and washes were carried out in aqueous buffer at 64 °C as described (28Kent N.A. Tsang J.S.H. Crowther D.J. Mellor J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5229-5241Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Probe fragments were as follows with nucleotide positions relative to the quoted coding region: CLB2, EcoRV (+787) to a PCR primer at +304; GAL2, HaeIII (+440) to BamHI (+873); DRS2, XhoI (+460) to EcoRV (+810); PSK1, BamHI (+727) to PCR primer at +327; SHU1, SphI (+697) to NcoI (+940); FUN30, BclI (+1109) to ClaI (+1472); ERV46, ScaI (+940) to HindIII (+1401); GAL3, NheI (-655) to PstI (-867); MET16, MscI (+412) to EcoRI (+736). Northern Analysis—RNA was isolated from 2 × 108 cell aliquots of cultures grown under identical conditions to those used for chromatin analysis using the RNeasy midi kit (Qiagen) and processed according to the manufacturer's protocols. Probes were prepared and hybridized exactly as described for the chromatin analyses. The DRS2 probe was the 390-bp XhoI/EcoRV fragment used above as an end-label. ACT1 transcript was detected using a BamHI fragment that contains the entire ACT1 gene. Cbf1p Electrophoretic Mobility Assay—2.0 × 108 cell samples were treated with glass beads to extract total protein into buffer containing 420 mm NaCl as described (28Kent N.A. Tsang J.S.H. Crowther D.J. Mellor J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5229-5241Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Samples containing 20 μg of total protein were incubated with an end-labeled double-stranded 21-bp oligonucleotide containing a CACGTG palindrome and analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay on a 4% polyacrylamide, 0.5% Tris borate EDTA gel as described (28Kent N.A. Tsang J.S.H. Crowther D.J. Mellor J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5229-5241Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Western Analysis—Protein samples were prepared as for electrophoretic mobility assay, and 20 μg of total protein were separated on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and electroblotted to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Blots were incubated with the 9E10 anti-Myc monoclonal antibody at a 1:200 dilution (Sigma) or an anti-α-tubulin monoclonal antibody (a generous gift from K. Gull) at a 1:2000 dilution. Bioinformatics—Positions of CACRTG motifs were taken from sequence data available the Stanford Saccharomyces Genome Data Base (www.yeastgenome.org) and the Regulatory Sequence Analysis Tools website (www.ucmb.ulb.ac.be/bioinformatics/rsa-tools). The presence of motifs within the loci was confirmed by electrophoretic mobility assay of cloned DNA fragments with wild-type and cbf1 mutant protein extracts as described above and/or DNA sequencing. 2S.

Maps of CACRTG motif distribution in budding yeast in upstream DNA or by chromosome are available at the Kent lab website (www2.bioch.ox.ac.uk/~nakent). To examine the extent of Cbf1p function as a chromatin modulator throughout the yeast genome, we assayed in vivo Cbf1p binding and MNase accessibility at a panel of loci with potential Cbf1p binding CACRTG motifs. (Table I; Fig. 1A). We examined both palindromic CACGTG motifs and non-palindromic CACATG motifs. Motifs within the GAL2, GSH1, and SHU1 loci were chosen based on reports of Cbf1p-dependent changes in transcription (5Bram R.J. Kornberg R.D. Mol. Cell.

In contrast, although glyoxalase II activity has been detected both in the cytosol and mitochondria of mammals, only a single gene encoding glyoxalase II has been identified. Previously it was thought that this gene (the hydroxyacylglutathione hydrolase gene), comprised 8 exons that are transcribed into mRNA and that the resulting mRNA species encoded a single cytosolic form of glyoxalase II. Here we show that this gene gives rise to two distinct mRNA species transcribed from 9 and 10 exons, respectively. The 9-exon-derived transcript encodes two protein species: mitochondrially targeted glyoxylase II, which is initiated from an AUG codon in a previously uncharacterized part of the mRNA sequence, and cytosolic glyoxalase II, which is initiated by internal ribosome entry at a downstream AUG codon. The transcript deriving from 10 exons has an in-frame termination codon between the two initiating AUG codons and hence only encodes the cytosolic form of the protein. Confocal fluorescence microscopy indicates that the mitochondrially targeted form of glyoxalase II is directed to the mitochondrial matrix. Analysis of glyoxalase II mRNA sequences from a number of species indicates that dual initiation from alternative AUG codons is conserved throughout vertebrates.

In the cytosol the action of two glyoxalase enzymes together with reduced glutathione (GSH), collectively termed the glyoxalase system, is required to prevent the accumulation of methylglyoxal (MG), 1The abbreviations used are: MG, methylglyoxal; CMV, cytomegalovirus; Ct, amplification threshold cycle; DsRed2, modified Discosoma sp. red fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; exAiATG, exon A initiating ATG codon; ex1iATG, exon 1 initiating ATG codon; EYFP, enhanced yellow fluorescent protein; 6-FAM, 6-carboxyfluorescein; HAGH, hydroxyacylglutathione hydrolase; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; TAMRA, carboxytetramethylrhodamine; UTR, untranslated region; RT, reverse transcriptase; IRES, internal ribosome entry site. a toxic by-product of glycolysis, amino acid, and ketone body metabolism (1Uotila L.

J. 1990; 269: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar), and hence to prevent accumulation of MG adducts (3Vander Jagt D.L. Dolphin D. Poulson R. Avromonic O. Coenzymes and Cofactors Glutathione: Chemical, Biochemical and Medical Aspects. 3. John Wiley & Sons, New York1989: 597-641Google Scholar). MG spontaneously forms a hemithioacetal adduct with GSH. Glyoxalase I (lactoylglutathione lyase; EC 4.4.1.5) produces S-d-lactoylglutathione from this adduct (2Thornalley P.J. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar) and glyoxalase II (hydroxyacylglutathione hydrolase; EC 3.1.2.6) in turn hydrolyzes S-d-lactoylglutathione to d-lactate and hence regenerates GSH (1Uotila L. Dolphin D. Poulson R. Avromonic O. Coenzymes and Cofactors Glutathione: Chemical, Biochemical and Medical Aspects. 3. John Wiley & Sons, New York1989: 767-804Google Scholar). Glyoxalase II is a member of the zinc metallohydrolase family having a β-lactamase fold (4Daiyasu H. Osaka K. Ishino Y. Toh H. FEBS Lett. 2001; 503: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). It has broad substrate specificity for glutathione thiol esters, hydrolyzing a number of these species (besides S-d-lactoylglutathione) to their corresponding carboxylic acids and reduced glutathione. Among these substrates, 2-hydroxy thiol esters appear to be hydrolyzed with greatest efficiency (5Ridderstrom M. Saccucci F. Hellman U. Bergman T. Principato G. Mannervik B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 319-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The glyoxalase system is ubiquitous throughout the eukaryotic and prokaryotic kingdoms (6Bito A. Haider M. Hadler I. Breitenbach M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21509-21519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In microorganisms it has been straightforward to demonstrate a function. For example, when Escherichia coli is grown on glycerol as the predominant carbon source, elevated MG levels are generated by the action of MG synthase on the metabolic intermediate, dihydroxyacetone phosphate. The glyoxalase system removes significant amounts of MG and has been shown to be critical for growth in this situation (7MacLean M.J. Ness L.S. Ferguson G.P. Booth I.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In yeast, one study reported a similar protective function during growth in glycerol-rich medium (8Penninckx M.J. Jaspers C.J. Legrain M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6030-6036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas another has reported that the enzyme system only protects significantly against exogenous MG (6Bito A. Haider M. Hadler I. Breitenbach M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21509-21519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In the latter study the contribution of glyoxalase I (encoded by a single gene GLX1) was demonstrated by gene knockout. Additional knockouts showed that two separately encoded isoforms of glyoxylase II, one cytosolic (GLO2) and one mitochondrial (GLO4), had a contributory role. In addition to yeast, mitochondrial glyoxalase II activity has been detected in the tissues of higher eukaryotes including rat (9Talesa V. Uotila L. Koivusalo M. Principato G. Giovannini E. Rosi G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 955: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and Arabidopsis thaliana (10Maiti M.K. Krishnasamy S. Owen H.A. Makaroff C.A. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 35: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The function of the mitochondrial pool of glyoxalase II activity is unknown. Of interest, glyoxalase I appears to be absent from mitochondria in the rat (9Talesa V. Uotila L. Koivusalo M. Principato G. Giovannini E. Rosi G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 955: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 11Talesa V. Uotila L. Koivusalo M. Principato G. Giovannini E. Rosi G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 993: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), however, S-d-lactoylglutathione has been detected in the mitochondria (12Scire A. Tanfani F. Saccucci F. Bertoli E. Principato G. Proteins. 2000; 41: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and so may ultimately provide a substrate for glyoxalase II. In higher plants, there is little information on glyoxalase I, but, as in yeast, distinct genes encoding cytosolic and mitochondrially expressed forms of glyoxalase II have been detected. Thus in A. thaliana five genes have been identified, three that appear to encode mitochondrial proteins (GLX2–1, GLX2–4, and GLX2–5), one that encodes a cytosolic protein (GLX2–2), and one whose function is currently uncharacterized (GLX2–3) (10Maiti M.K. Krishnasamy S. Owen H.A. Makaroff C.A. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 35: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 13Zang T.M. Hollman D.A. Crawford P.A. Crowder M.W. Makaroff C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4788-4795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). An apparent homologue of one of the mitochondrial forms (AY054407 from Oryza sativa) has been overexpressed in tobacco and increases resistance to salinity (14Singla-Pareek S.L. Reddy M.K. Sopory S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14672-14677Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Interest in the mammalian glyoxalase system derives in part from evidence for the role of MG-derived advanced glycation end products in the pathogenesis of diabetic complications and other diseases (15Thornalley P.J. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1998; 111–112: 137-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). A single gene encodes human glyoxalase I and its overexpression in bovine aortic endothelial cells has been reported to prevent MG accumulation and advanced glycation end product formation under hyperglycemic conditions (16Shinohara M. Thornalley P.J. Giardino I. Beisswenger P. Thorpe S.R. Onorato J. Brownlee M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1142-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). In vertebrates there is a single gene encoding glyoxalase II, HAGH (hydroxyacylglutathione hydrolase) (5Ridderstrom M. Saccucci F. Hellman U. Bergman T. Principato G. Mannervik B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 319-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 17Ji X. Moore H.D. Russell R.G. Watts D.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 714-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 18Cho M.Y. Bae C.D. Park J.B. Lee T.H. Exp. Mol. Med. 1998; 30: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The mRNA sequence of glyoxalase II identified by Mannervik and co-workers (5Ridderstrom M. Saccucci F. Hellman U. Bergman T. Principato G. Mannervik B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 319-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) contains eight coding exons that encode the 260-amino acid cytosolic form of the enzyme. In this paper, we demonstrate that extended transcripts from the human HAGH gene encode both cytosolic and mitochondrial isoforms of glyoxalase II, and that the previous mRNA sequence is incomplete. The cytosolic form originates by internal priming of protein synthesis from the initiating AUG codon previously identified in exon 1 (5Ridderstrom M. Saccucci F. Hellman U. Bergman T. Principato G. Mannervik B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 319-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The mitochondrial form arises from initiation of translation at an upstream AUG codon encoded on an upstream exon that can be fused in-frame to exon 1. Examination of GenBank™ nucleic acid sequences indicates that alternative translation initiation of HAGH transcripts is conserved throughout vertebrates giving a possible explanation for the production of vertebrate intramitochondrial glyoxalase II. Determination of the 5′ extent of the glyoxalase II mRNA and the production of constructs to test its function are described below. As the 5′ end of the mRNA is very (G + C) rich, 5% Me2SO (BDH) and 1 m betaine (Sigma) were included in all PCR to allow amplification. PCR amplification was performed using the Expand high fidelity system (Roche Diagnostics) except where a blunt end was produced with Pfu polymerase (Stratagene). All constructs were sequenced on an ABI310 automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems) using BigDye® Terminator version 3.1 sequencing reagents. All primers were synthesized by Invitrogen. All restriction endonuclease enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs. 5′-RACE—RNA ligase-mediated RACE was performed using the GeneRacer kit (Invitrogen) as directed by manufacturer's instructions using total RNA extracted from HepG2 cells by the TRIzol method (Invitrogen). Thermoscript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) was used in the presence of 1.5 m betaine and 10% Me2SO. For priming of cDNA synthesis the primer 5′-GCAGCCTCCTTGGTCTCATCATCAATG-3′ was used. Nested PCRs were performed using the primary primer 5′-GGCAGGCAGCACCTCTACCTTCAT-3′ (primer 3, Fig. 1) in all cases. For secondary amplification the primer 5′-CGGTCAGGTTCTTCCGCAAATCT-3′ was used to amplify from exon 1 and the primer 5′-GCCGCGAGCCTCCGCCTCTTTTT-3′ was used to amplify from the 5′ end of exon A. Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR—Total RNA from HepG2 cells, HT1080 cells, and from human liver and kidney (Clontech total RNA panel) was used to synthesize poly(dT)-primed cDNA with Multiscribe reverse transcriptase (Applied Biosystems). Amplification across the exon A-exon 1 boundary was performed using the forward and reverse primers 5′-GGGCAGCTCGGCAGTCCAG-3′ (forward, primer 1, Fig. 1) and 5′-GGCAGGCAGCACCTCTACCTTCAT-3′ (reverse, primer 3, Fig. 1). Amplification of the coding exons was performed using the same forward primer with 5′-TCCCCAAATCCGCTGAAGGTG-3′ (reverse, primer 4, Fig. 1). Plasmid Construction and Site-directed Mutagenesis—Constructs pPrA1-TOPO and pPrAB1-TOPO containing the promoter (Pr) and alternative 5′ UTR sequences (A,1 or A,B,1) up to and including the exon 1 initiating ATG (ex1iATG) were made by ligation of two separate products. (i) Genomic sequence containing the core promoter region and exon A was amplified using 5′-ACGCAGACGATGTTCTTTCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CGGCAGCGCGGCCTTAG-3′ (reverse) and subcloned into the pCR2.1 TOPO vector (Invitrogen) to give pPrA-TOPO. (ii) The cDNA sequence spanning exons A and 1 was amplified from HepG2 cDNA using primers 5′-GGGCAGCTCGGCAGTCCAG-3′ (forward, primer 1, Fig. 1) and 5′-GGCAGGCAGCACCTCTACCTTCAT-3′ (reverse, primer 3, Fig. 1). Two products were generated with and without exon B, and were subcloned into pCR2.1 TOPO to generate pA1-TOPO and pAB1-TOPO. (iii) Digestion of pPrA-TOPO at a vector HindIII and a unique StuI site 5 bases upstream of the 3′ exon/intron boundary of exon A allowed replacement of the genomic sequence 3′ of the StuI site with the cDNA sequence for both splice forms up to and including the Ex1iATG by ligating HindIII/StuI fragments excised from pA1-TOPO and pAB1-TOPO to yield constructs pPrA1-TOPO and pPrAB1-TOPO. To generate a fusion of the glyoxalase II promoter and 5′ UTR sequence with firefly luciferase, products were amplified from pPrA1-TOPO and pPrAB1-TOPO using M13 forward primer and 5′-GGCAGGCAGCACCTCTACCTTCAT-3′ (reverse) (primer 3, Fig. 1) and were digested with XbaI to give a compatible cohesive end. pGL3 basic vector (Promega) was first linearized by digestion with NcoI and then blunted by mung bean nuclease (New England Biolabs) removing the luciferase initiating ATG. Subsequently a cohesive vector end was generated with NheI to allow subcloning of the digested PCR products giving pPrA1-GL3 and pPrAB1-GL3, respectively. A positive control using the luciferase initiating ATG was generated as follows. The promoter and a shortened region of 5′ UTR sequence (nucleotides -103 to +263) not containing an initiating ATG was amplified from genomic DNA using 5′-ACGCAGACGATGTTCTTTCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCGCTCAACTTGTTTTGTCC-3′ (reverse), and the product was subcloned into pCR2.1 TOPO vector to give pPrTOPO. The promoter sequence was subcloned into pGL3 basic after digestion with SacI and XhoI to give the positive control construct shown in Fig. 2. A negative control construct fused the same promoter sequence as in the positive control to firefly luciferase from which the initiating ATG had been deleted. pGL3 basic digested with NcoI and blunted as above was then digested with SacI and the glyoxalase II promoter insert was introduced as a SacI-EcoRV fragment. ExA(iATG → TTG), ex1(iATG → TTG) mutants and exA+1(iATG → TTG) double mutants were generated from pPrA1-GL3 using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The phosphorylated oligonucleotides (with mismatched base emboldened) used were 5′-P-GCCCGGCCCGGGTCTTGGTGGTGGG-3′ and 5′-P-CCGTGGACGAGGGCACCTTGAAGGTAGAGG-3′. To ensure a high level of luciferase expression for Western blotting, pCMV-A1-GL3 and pCMV-AB1-GL3 were derived from pPrA1-GL3 and pPrAB1-GL3. The glyoxalase II core promoter region was removed from these constructs by digestion with EcoRI and PvuII, an enzyme that cuts 2 bp downstream from the experimentally determined +1 site (Fig. 1A). This was replaced with the CMV immediate/early promoter sequence and a T7 promoter. First the CMV and Renilla luciferase region of pRL-CMV (Promega) were excised using BglII and XbaI and subcloned into pGEM3Zf+ (Promega). This construct was digested with NheI, the 5′ overhangs were filled with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I (New England Biolabs). The appropriate fragment was excised with EcoRI digestion and the resulting fragment was ligated to digested pPrA1-GL3 and pPrAB1-GL3 constructs (above). Constructs pCMV-exAi(ATG → TTG) and pCMV-ex1i(ATG → TTG) were made using the same strategy. Real Time PCR—Constructs pCMV-A1-GL3 and pCMV-AB1-GL3 were in vitro transcribed with T7 polymerase (Ambion) to yield 2-kb transcripts from each that spanned exons A and 1 or A,B and 1, respectively. Equal concentrations of each transcript determined by A260 and agarose gel electrophoresis were mixed and used as a control for quantification by real time RT-PCR. HepG2 cell RNA and in vitro transcripts were used to synthesize cDNA with random hexamers. Real time PCR were performed on an ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detection system with TaqMan 2× Universal PCR mixture (Applied Biosystems). Primers and probes were designed to cross exon boundaries using the Primer Express program version 1.5 (Applied Biosystems, in each case) to specifically detect products deriving from mRNA and concentrations of each were optimized. For detecting exon A-exon 1 mRNA, primers 5′-CCGAGGCCTCGGTCCA-3′ (forward) and 5′-GTCAGGTTCTTCCGCAAATCTG-3′ (reverse) were used with probe 5′-6FAM-CCCTGCTGGGAGTTTTCTGCCACA-TAMRA-3′. For exon B-exon 1 mRNA, primer 5′-GCTGCCGGGCTCGAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGCTGGACCTAGCGCTTTC-3′ (reverse) were used with probe 5′-6-FAM-TGAGCGTGGCGCGGAGCG-TAMRA-3′. Fluorescent Protein Constructs—The region encoding the mitochondrial targeting sequence of glyoxalase II was amplified with primers 5′-GGGCAGCTCGGCAGTCCAG-3′ (forward, primer 1, Fig. 1) and 5′-GGTGCCCTCGTCCACGGTC-3′ (reverse, primer 2, Fig. 1) using pPrA1-GL3 as template. The product was digested at an XmaI site three bases upstream of exAiATG. The pDsRed2-N1 vector (Clontech) was digested with AgeI, overhangs filled with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I were then redigested with XmaI. Ligation yielded the vector pGII-DsRed2. Luciferase Activity and Immunoblotting Assays—HepG2 cells (European Collection of Cell Cultures) were cultured in Eagle's modified essential medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (First Link), 2 mm glutamine (Sigma), and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic solution (Sigma) in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. For luciferase assays cells were seeded at 4 × 104/well in 24-well plates, cultured for 24 h, and then transfected with 200 ng of firefly luciferase construct and 20 ng of pHRL-TK (Promega) per well using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche) according to manufacturer's instructions. Cells were lysed 48 h post-transfection in passive lysis buffer (Promega) and assayed using the dual luciferase assay system (Promega) according to manufacturer's instructions with a Mediators PhL luminometer. For Western blotting cells were seeded at 3 × 105/well in 6-well plates cultured for 24 h and transfected with 1 μg of each firefly luciferase construct per well using FuGENE 6. Whole extracts of transfected cells were prepared using SDS-PAGE loading buffer (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207464) Google Scholar) heated to 100 °C added directly to cells (150 μl/well). The lysate was cleared by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 10 min). Total protein was measured using the BCA assay system (Pierce) and samples were electrophoresed on an 8% polyacrylamide gel (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207464) Google Scholar) and blotted to the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Pierce). Blots were blocked with 5% (w/v) nonfat milk powder in Tris-buffered saline at room temperature for 1 h. Goat anti-firefly luciferase primary antibody (Promega) was used at a 1:1000 dilution in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with Trisbuffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-goat secondary antibody (Promega) was used for incubation at a dilution of 1:5000 at room temperature for 1 h. Antibody complexes were visualized by incubation with 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (Calbiochem) for 30 min. Confocal Microsocopy—HepG2 cells were seeded at 4 × 104/well on 13-mm/0.17-mm thick coverslips in 24-well plates. Cells were transfected with pGII-DsRed2 alone or were co-transfected with a carnitine palmitoyltransferase I-EGFP fusion construct (20Broadway N.M. Pease R.J. Birdsey G. Shayeghi M. Turner N.A. David S.E. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 223-231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or with plasmid pEYFP-Mito (Clontech) (400 ng total DNA/well in each case). After 72 h cells were fixed for 30 min with 4% paraformaldeyde in Dulbecco's modified phosphate-buffered saline (Sigma), washed twice with saline (10 min each), and mounted using Vectashield Hard Set (Vector Laboratories). Cells were prepared for immunocytochemistry as described by Satoh et al. (21Satoh M. Hamamoto T. Seo N. Kagawa Y. Endo H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 300: 482-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) using an anti-cytochrome c monoclonal antibody (6H2.B4, BD Pharmingen) and rabbit anti-mouse IgG1 fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate (Dako). Images were obtained using a ×63 oil immersion objective of a Leica DMIRE2 confocal laser scanning microscope at 1024 × 1024 pixel resolution using a pinhole diameter of 76 μm and averaged 30 times. For cells transfected with multiple fluorescent proteins, signals were collected over a narrow wavelength band after excitation with one laser line at a time to exclude bleed through of signal from other fluorophores. Bioinformatic Analysis—Details of the data base searches and alignment utilities are shown as Supplementary Materials. Examination of Available HAGH mRNA Sequences—The first reported human cDNA sequence of HAGH (X90999) had 8 coding exons (5Ridderstrom M. Saccucci F. Hellman U. Bergman T. Principato G. Mannervik B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 319-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, the NCBI Reference Sequence for HAGH mRNA (NM_005326) contains an additional 500-bp exon at the start of the sequence (termed exon A in this report). In the genomic sequence MapViewer (NCBI) shows that exon A is located some 3.7 kb upstream of the previously assigned first coding exon (exon 1, Ref. 5Ridderstrom M. Saccucci F. Hellman U. Bergman T. Principato G. Mannervik B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 319-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and around 100 bp downstream of gene DKFZP566J2046. Examination of exon A shows the presence of an in-frame ATG (exAiATG) 144 bp upstream of the previously recognized initiation codon (ex1iATG) with no intervening stop codons. Initiation at exAiATG would add 48 extra amino acids to the amino terminus of glyoxalase II (Fig. 1A). Examination of EST sequences (including CK824895 and BU176541) indicated a further class of transcript with a second novel exon (termed exon B) between exons A and 1. The presence of exon B introduces a stop codon in-frame with the upstream ATG in exon A thus preventing the addition of the amino-terminal sequence to glyoxalase II (Fig. 1B). 5′ Sequence Determination of HAGH mRNA—To confirm the presence of the two alternatively spliced HAGH transcripts, described above, and to determine the full-length 5′ sequence, RNA ligase-mediated RACE of HepG2 RNA was performed with gene-specific primers located in exon 1. All products continued in a 5′ direction past exAiATG and a proportion of the products contained exon B. The products were all truncated with respect to NM_005326. To identify the transcription start site, primers were designed in exon A. Under optimized conditions, a single PCR product containing the 164-bp HAGH sequence was generated, and sequencing of 5 representative subclones identified a consistent 5′ end of the mRNA sequence (shown as nucleotide 1, in Fig. 1A). This cDNA sequence (AY576804) added an extra 33 bp of 5′ mRNA sequence to that given in NM_005326 (Fig. 1A), and these 33 bp agree in sequence with the corresponding segment of the genomic sequence of chromosome 16. RT-PCR using a forward primer in exon A and reverse primer in exon 1 showed that RNA from human liver, kidney, and HT1080 fibroblasts also contained both 5′ splice variants in similar proportion to HepG2 (Fig. 1C). When RT-PCR was repeated with HepG2 and liver RNA using a forward primer in exon A and reverse primer in the 3′ UTR sequence in exon 8 (primers 1 and 4, Fig. 1A) this generated two products corresponding to exons A,1–8 and exons A,B,1–8 without evidence for alternative splicing of the exons 1–8 (results not shown). Localization of Core Promoter Region—Examination of the genomic sequence at the 5′ end of the HAGH gene shows that only 28 bp separate the experimentally determined +1 site of HAGH from the single coding exon of gene DKFZP566J2046 (encoding a homologue of fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase) on the opposite DNA strand. Accordingly it appears likely that the core promoter of glyoxalase II resides in this small space between the two genes. A 1.1-kb genomic fragment containing this region (-839 to +263, where +1 is the first base of the mRNA sequence in Fig. 1) was subcloned into the pGL3 basic vector (Promega) and conferred promoter activity ∼55-fold over background in transfected HepG2 cells (results not shown). Fragment-(-103 to +263) showed comparable and possibly higher activity (95-fold over background). Whereas it cannot be assumed that all sequences relevant to physiological expression are contained within this region, fragment-(-103 to +263) was included in constructs designed to examine the initiation of translation (described below). Real Time PCR—To estimate the relative abundance of the A,1–8 and A,B,1–8 isoforms of the glyoxalase II mRNA in HepG2 cells, real time RT-PCR was carried out. Both cDNA synthesis and PCR amplification of the A,B,1–8 isoform may be intrinsically less efficient than of the A,1–8 isoform in view of the high G/C content of exon B (80%). To correct for this possibility, data from total cellular RNA were normalized to data obtained with a defined mixture of in vitro transcripts spanning exons A,B,1 and A,1 (i.e. covering the amplicon). The average Ct values for A,1 and A,B,1 in vitro transcripts (at a constant threshold value, and giving replicate values in parentheses) were 25.66 (25.44, 25.55, 26.00) and 30.07 (29.81, 30.19, 30.21), respectively, giving a ΔCt = 4.41 and for HepG2 total RNA was 26.76 (26.82, 27.01, 26.45) and 30.25 (30.28, 30.37, 30.11), respectively, giving ΔCt = 3.49. This equates to a relative abundance of the A,1–8 and the A,B,1–8 transcripts in HepG2 cells of ∼1:2, i.e. both forms are similarly represented in cells. In contrast, uncorrected PCR data would suggest a marked preponderance of the A,1 splice form as implied in Fig. 1C. Nucleotide and Amino Acid Sequence Analysis of Glyoxalase II Orthologues—The mRNA sequences of a number of HAGH orthologues were examined to determine the extent of their conservation. All vertebrate sequences contained a highly conserved cytosolic coding region of 260 amino acids and all possessed an in-frame upstream ATG corresponding to human exAiATG, adding between 43 and 48 amino acids depending on the species. Using MitoProt analysis (22Claros M.G. Vincens P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 779-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar) the amino-terminal extension of all sequences except Gallus gallus was predicted to contain a mitochondrial targeting sequence with a score greater than 50% and all sequences were predicted to contain a cleavage site. Similar analysis of the glyoxalase II proteins without the amino-terminal extensions gave scores of less than 10% in all cases except for Bos taurus (37%), and none of the proteins contained a predicted cleavage site. These data are summarized in Table I.Table IAnalysis of amino-terminal extensions of the glyoxalase II protein in vertebrates mRNA sequences were obtained from GenBank™ as curated sequences, or were assembled from EST sequences and genomic clones (35Huang X. Genomics. 1992; 14: 18-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), and were then translated using ORFfinder (NCBI). Alignments were performed using the ClustalW program (36Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55963) Google Scholar). Full protein sequence alignments and the NCBI accession numbers of the clones considered are submitted as a supplementary figure (Fig. S1). Predicted sizes of ORF are shown and sequences of the amino-terminal extensions are aligned with the human sequences between the exon"
https://openalex.org/W2141844501,"Increased circulating and cardiac TNF-alpha levels during myocardial ischemia have been found in both experimental animals and patients with ischemic heart disease and advanced heart failure. Soluble TNF-alpha receptor 1 (sTNFR1) is an antagonist to TNF-alpha. In the present study, we examined whether sTNFR1 improves cardiac function in rats after myocardial infarction. Male Wistar rats were subjected to left coronary artery (LCA) ligation. Immediately after the ligation, a total of 200 microg of either the sTNFR1 or LacZ plasmid was injected into three different sites in the left ventricular wall. From 1 to 21 days after LCA ligation, TNF-alpha bioactivity in the heart was higher in rats receiving LacZ plasmid than in sham-operated rats, whereas sTNFR1 plasmid significantly suppressed the increase. The LV diastolic dimension was significantly lower, and the fractional shortening was significantly higher in rats treated with the sTNFR1 plasmid than in those treated with the LacZ plasmid. At 21 days after LCA ligation, the LV end-diastolic pressure was also significantly lower in the rats treated with the sTNFR1 plasmid. In addition, the sTNFR1 expression plasmid had significantly reduced the infarct size. In conclusion, TNF-alpha bioactivity in the heart increased during the early stage of infarction and remained elevated. This elevation seemed partially responsible for the impairment of LV function and the increased infarct size. Suppression of TNF-alpha bioactivity from the early stage of infarction with the sTNFR1 plasmid improved cardiac function and reduced infarct size."
https://openalex.org/W2081113836,"Chondrosarcomas represent the second most frequent class of primary skeletal malignancies. This tumor type is highly resistant to radiation therapy and currently available chemotherapies, thereby limiting treatment choice to surgical resection. Identifying the mechanisms responsible for chondrosarcoma cell proliferation is therefore crucial for the development of new treatment strategies. Here, we demonstrate a significant reduction in rat chondrosarcoma cell proliferation following treatment with pharmacological inhibitors (SB202190 and PD169316) of p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases. In an attempt to dissect possible mechanisms, we investigated the effect of p38 inhibition on promoter activity of cell-cycle genes. Surprisingly, p38 inhibition resulted in upregulation of the activities of all three D-type cyclin promoters. In addition, p38 inhibitors induced increased transcription of the cell-cycle inhibitor p21waf1/cip1. As expected, promoter activity of the cyclin A gene, which lies downstream of D-type cyclins and p21 in cell-cycle progression, was strongly reduced by p38 inhibitors. These effects were independent of a cyclic AMP response element and conferred by the proximal 150 nucleotides of the cyclin A promoter. Decreased transcription was accompanied by greatly reduced cyclin A protein levels upon p38 inhibition. These observations indicate complex regulation of chondrosarcoma cell-cycle progression by p38 signaling, and suggest that components of p38 MAP kinase pathways may be effective targets in the treatment of these tumors."

https://openalex.org/W2035273847,"SHP-2 tyrosine phosphatase is highly expressed in hematopoietic cells; however, the function of SHP-2 in hematopoietic cell processes is not fully understood. Recent identification of SHP-2 mutations in childhood leukemia further emphasizes the importance of SHP-2 regulation in hematopoietic cells. We previously reported that SHP-2 played a positive role in IL-3-induced activation of Jak2 kinase in a catalytic-dependent manner. Interestingly, enforced expression of wild-type (WT) SHP-2 in Ba/F3 cells enhanced growth factor deprivation-induced apoptosis. Biochemical analyses revealed that although IL-3 activation of Jak2 kinase was increased, tyrosyl phosphorylation of its downstream substrate STAT5 was disproportionately decreased by the overexpression of SHP-2. Following IL-3 deprivation, the tyrosyl phosphorylation of STAT5 that is required for its antiapoptotic activity was rapidly diminished in SHP-2 overexpressing cells. As a result, reduction of the putative downstream targets of STAT5–Bcl-XL and pim-1 was accelerated by overexpression of SHP-2. Further investigation showed that SHP-2 associated with STAT5, and that it was indeed able to dephosphorylate STAT5. Finally, overexpression of SHP-2 in primary bone marrow hematopoietic progenitor cells compromised their differentiative and proliferative potential, and enhanced growth factor withdrawal-induced cell death. And, the effect of SHP-2 overexpression on growth factor-dependent survival was diminished in STAT5-deficient hematopoietic cells. Taken together, these results suggest that SHP-2 tyrosine phosphatase negatively regulates hematopoietic cell survival by dephosphorylation of STAT5."
https://openalex.org/W2062921399,"Receptors as well as some G protein subunits internalize after agonist stimulation. It is not clear whether Gαq or Gβγ undergo such regulated translocation. Recent studies demonstrate that m3 muscarinic receptor activation in SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells causes recruitment of tubulin to the plasma membrane. This subsequently transactivates Gαq and activates phospholipase Cβ1. Interaction of tubulin-GDP with Gβγ at the offset of phospholipase Cβ1 signaling appears involved in translocation of tubulin and Gβγ to vesicle-like structures in the cytosol (Popova, J. S., and Rasenick, M. M. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 34299–34308). The relationship of this internalization to the clathrin-mediated endocytosis of the activated m3 muscarinic receptors or Gαq involvement in this process has not been clarified. To test this, SK-N-SH cells were treated with carbachol, and localization of Gαq, Gβγ, tubulin, clathrin, and m3 receptors were analyzed by both cellular imaging and biochemical techniques. Upon agonist stimulation both tubulin and clathrin translocated to the plasma membrane and co-localized with receptors, Gαq and Gβγ. Fifteen minutes later receptors, Gβγ and tubulin, but not Gαq, internalized with the clathrin-coated vesicles. Coimmunoprecipitation of m3 receptors with Gβγ, tubulin, and clathrin from the cytosol of carbachol-treated cells was readily observed. These data suggested that Gβγ subunits might organize the formation of a multiprotein complex linking m3 receptors to tubulin since they interacted with both proteins. Such protein assemblies might explain the dynamin-dependent but β-arrestin-independent endocytosis of m3 muscarinic receptors since tubulin interaction with dynamin might guide or insert the complex into clathrin-coated pits. This novel mechanism of internalization might prove important for other β-arrestin-independent endocytic pathways.

Many activated receptors sequester in clathrin-coated pits and undergo endocytosis after GRK phosphorylation and subsequent binding of β-arrestin at these phosphorylated sites. β-Arrestin binds to the heavy chain of clathrin and the AP2 adaptor protein and, thus, translocates activated receptors to the clathrin-coated pits (9Goodman O.B.

Gβγ is also involved in dissociation of tubulin from the plasma membrane at the offset of PLCβ1 signaling after m3 muscarinic receptor activation (8Popova J.S. Rasenick M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34299-34308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Because m3 receptors appear to require dynamin but not β-arrestin for internalization (11Lee K.B.

Chem. 1998; 273: 12967-12972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that Gβγ association with tubulin might direct these receptors to the clathrin-mediated endocytic pathway. Tubulin binds the essential vesicle-pinching protein, dynamin (for review, see Refs. 31McNiven M.A. Cao H. Pitts K.R. Yoon Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 115-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar and 32Sever S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and activates dynamin GTPase (33Shpetner H.S. Vallee R.B. Nature. 1992; 355: 733-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The mechanoenzyme dynamin is also known to recruit effectors of the endocytic process (34Sever S. Muhlberg A.B. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1999; 398: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), one of which might be tubulin. Here we demonstrate that complexes containing m3 muscarinic receptors, Gβγ, and tubulin internalize at the offset of PLCβ1 signaling through a clathrin-mediated endocytic mechanism. It is suggested that coupling of m3 receptors to tubulin through Gβγ might guide receptor sequestration, since tubulin interacts with dynamin and, thus, might facilitate the insertion of the complexes in the clathrin-coated pits. This may represent a novel mechanism for receptor internalization that is alternative to the β-arrestin-mediated pathway. It is finally hypothesized that, if excluded from the early endosomes, tubulin-Gβγ complexes might seed tubulin assembly in the cytosol and reverse the microtubule depolymerization caused by PLCβ1-evoked Ca2+ increase. This suggests a regulated interconnection between G protein-mediated intracellular signaling and the remodeling of the cytoskeleton. Expression Constructs—cDNAs encoding HA-tagged wild type and dominant negative K44E dynamin I were originally obtained from Dr. Richard Vallee (Columbia University) (35Herskovits J.S. Burgess C.C. Obar R.A. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 565-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). They were subsequently cloned into pcDNA3.1zeo using XhoI and XbaI and kindly provided by Dr. Mark von Zastrow (University of California, San Francisco) (36Chu P. Murray S. Lissin D. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27124-27130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Transfection—SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum according to standard procedures (4Popova J.S. Rasenick M.M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2774-2782Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Where indicated cells were seeded in 12-well plates and transfected with 1 μg/well cDNA of wild type or dominant negative dynamin I K44E using Gene-PORTER transfection reagent (GTS, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Assays were performed 48 h after the start of transfection. Protein expression was verified by immunoblotting. Membrane Preparation and Western Blotting—SK-N-SH cells were sonicated in ice-cold 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.3 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (3 × 30 s, Branson Sonifer). Membrane pellets and supernatants were prepared as described (37Popova J.S. Garrison J.C. Rhee S.G. Rasenick M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6760-6765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was measured by the Bradford dye binding assay (38Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217508) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Membrane proteins transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (0.45 μm, Millipore Corp.) were probed with monoclonal antibody specific for α-tubulin (DM1A, Sigma) at a dilution of 1:1000 and polyclonal antisera specific for Gαq,Gβ,m3 muscarinic receptors, clathrin, and HA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) at a dilution of 1:500. Anti-mouse, rabbit, or goat IgGs were used as secondary antisera, respectively, followed by ECL detection of the corresponding protein bands. Translocation of Signaling Proteins in Intact SK-N-SH Cells—SK-N-SH cells were collected and washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and aliquots of 1 × 107 cells were distributed in plastic tubes on ice. Carbachol (100 μm) was immediately added, and the samples were incubated for the indicated time periods in a water bath at 37 °C with constant shaking. When tested, atropine (10 μm) was added before carbachol. After the incubation, each sample was transferred on ice and immediately sonicated as described. The samples were centrifuged at 600 × g at 4 °C, and the supernatants were pelleted at 20,000 × g at 4 °C. Both the pellets (P2 membrane fractions) and the corresponding supernatants (crude cytosolic fractions) were subjected to SDS/PAGE and immunoblotting. Note that the crude cytosolic fraction contains certain cellular structures including endocytic vesicles. Monoclonal anti-tubulin antibody (DM1A, Sigma), rabbit polyclonal anti-Gαq and Gβγ, and goat polyclonal anti-clathrin (Santa Cruz) antisera and ECL detection were utilized. The results were analyzed in a Storm 840 (Molecular Dynamics) image analysis system. Confocal Immunofluorescence Microscopy—SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells were treated with 100 μm carbachol, fixed in –20 °C methanol for 3 min, and washed 3 times 10 min each with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The cells were blocked for 40 min in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% milk and washed in phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were incubated with primary polyclonal anti-Gβ, Gαq, clathrin, m3 muscarinic receptor, or HA antisera (Santa Cruz) and secondary fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC)-conjugated, or Texas Red-conjugated secondary antisera as indicated. When a monoclonal anti-α-tubulin antibody (DM1A, Sigma) was utilized, secondary Texas Red-conjugated anti-mouse antibody was used. All primary polyclonal and secondary antisera were used at a dilution of 1:100. The monoclonal anti-tubulin antibody was utilized at a dilution of 1:500. For each experimental condition a total of 60 randomly selected cells over three to six consecutive experiments were evaluated for the distribution and colocalization of Gαq, Gβ, clathrin and tubulin, or tubulin and m3 muscarinic receptors or dynamin. Images were acquired using a laser-scanning confocal microscope Zeiss LSM 510 equipped with a 63× water immersion objective. A 488-nm beam from an argon-krypton laser was used for the excitation of FITC, whereas a 543-nm beam was used for Texas Red/TRITC excitation. Emission from FITC was detected through a BP505 filter whereas emission was from Texas Red/TRITC through a LP560 filter. Areas of antibody colocalization appear in yellow. Differential interference contrast (DIC) images of the cells were regularly acquired as well. Coverslips were examined at random. Final image composites were created using Adobe Photoshop 6.0. No specific TRITC, Texas Red, or FITC labeling was observed in cells treated with preimmune serum instead of the primary antiserum. Texas Red labeling was not observed when the anti-tubulin antibody was preincubated overnight at 4 °C with purified tubulin (1:1 ratio). FITC or TRITC labeling was not detected when the anti-Gβ or anti-Gαq antisera were preincubated with purified Gβγ or Gαq, respectively; both conditions tested at the same antibody dilutions. Similarly, no clathrin, Gβ, Gαq, m3 muscarinic receptor, or HA labeling was observed in the presence of respective blocking peptides provided by the manufacturer. Finally, Gαq labeling was not detected in mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking Gαq/11 (from M. Simon, Caltech). Immunoprecipitation—Coimmunoprecipitations of tubulin, Gβγ, Gαq,m3 muscarinic receptors, and clathrin were tested in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer-stripped SK-N-SH membranes or crude cytosolic fractions adjusted to 1% sodium deoxycholate and 1% Triton X-100 (1 h, 4 °C, and constant shaking) before and after stimulation with 100 μm carbachol as indicated. Samples (0.5 mg/ml cytosolic protein or 0.1 mg/ml membrane extract) were precleared with normal rabbit, goat, or mouse IgG (depending on the experimental protocol) and protein A/G PLUS-agarose (Santa Cruz) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Isolated supernatants were incubated for 4 h with 8 μl of polyclonal goat anti-clathrin or rabbit anti-Gβ antisera (Santa Cruz) or mouse tubulin antibody (DM1A, Sigma) at 4 °C with constant shaking. Immune complexes were precipitated with protein A/G PLUS-agarose as instructed by the manufacturer, and each immunoprecipitate was washed 4 times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. The pellets were resuspended in 1× sample buffer and subjected to SDS/PAGE followed by immunoblotting and ECL detection of the protein bands. Monoclonal anti-tubulin antibody (DM1A, Sigma) (dilution of 1:1000) and polyclonal anti-Gβ, Gαq, clathrin (dilution of 1:500), and anti-m3 muscarinic receptor (dilution of 1:200) antisera (Santa Cruz) were used to detect proteins of interest as described. No cross-reactivity was observed between the antisera used. Materials—Carbachol and atropine sulfate were from Sigma. FITC- and TRITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antisera were from EY Laboratories. FITC- and TRITC-conjugated rabbit anti-goat antisera were from Zymed Laboratories Inc.. Rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antiserum from Roche Applied Science and FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-goat antiserum from Vector Laboratories were also utilized. Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse antiserum was from Jackson Laboratories. All other reagents were of analytical grade. Internalization of Membrane-associated Tubulin with Gβγ, but Not Gαq, after Carbachol Stimulation of SK-N-SH Neuroblastoma Cells—Dimeric tubulin rapidly associates with the plasma membrane in response to carbachol stimulation (4Popova J.S. Rasenick M.M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2774-2782Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Popova J.S. Garrison J.C. Rhee S.G. Rasenick M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6760-6765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Cellular imaging demonstrates that 15 min after carbachol addition tubulin colocalizes with Gβγ in vesicle-like structures in the cytosol (8Popova J.S. Rasenick M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34299-34308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To analyze biochemically the sequence of these events, temporal patterns of colocalization of tubulin, Gαq, and Gβγ at the membrane and in the cytosol were studied in intact SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells (Fig. 1). Cells were incubated with carbachol for different time periods, and the content of tubulin, Gαq, and Gβγ in membrane and cytosolic fractions was analyzed by immunoblotting. As previously observed (4Popova J.S. Rasenick M.M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2774-2782Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), tubulin translocated to the plasma membrane in response to m3 muscarinic receptor activation (Fig. 1A). Two minutes after carbachol addition membrane-associated tubulin increased by 243% (n = 4) and gradually decreased subsequent to this time point. Ten minutes after carbachol addition, two-thirds of the tubulin that had been recruited to the membrane returned to the cytosol. Gβ distribution between membrane and cytosol also changed during the course of carbachol stimulation (Fig. 1B). Ten minutes after agonist addition, membrane Gβ decreased by 33% (n = 4) compared with the initial quantity of this protein. This corresponded to a Gβ increase in the cytosol. Neither tubulin nor Gβ translocation occurred when the cells were pretreated with 10 μm atropine. In contrast, membrane or cytosolic distribution of Gαq did not significantly change during the course of carbachol stimulation (Fig. 1C). This observation was in line with previous findings showing a lack of Gαq/11 translocation to the cytosol after receptor stimulation in neurons or in transiently transfected HEK 293 cells (39McConalogue K. Corvera C.U. Gamp P.D. Grady E.F. Bunnett N.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2305-2324Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 40Hughes T.E. Zhang H. Logothetis D.E. Berlot C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4227-4235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Thus, although tubulin was recruited to the plasma membrane to transactivate Gαq in response to carbachol stimulation (4Popova J.S. Rasenick M.M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2774-2782Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Popova J.S. Garrison J.C. Rhee S.G. Rasenick M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6760-6765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), it translocated back to the cytosol with Gβγ subunits but not Gαq. Confocal microscopy was used to verify these findings. The intracellular localization of tubulin, Gαq, and Gβγ was studied during the course of carbachol stimulation of intact SK-N-SH cells (Fig. 2). In unstimulated cells, Gαq and Gβ colocalized at focal spots of the plasma membrane, presumably where Gαq/βγ heterotrimers were located (Fig. 2A). However, significant Gαq/Gβ colocalization was also observed in the perinuclear region of the cells. Two minutes after carbachol application, the areas of Gαq/Gβ colocalization at the plasma membrane appeared somewhat merged and significantly broader. At the 15-min time point, Gαq and Gβ colocalized predominantly in the perinuclear region. Gβ was also seen in vesicle-like structures in the cytosol. However, Gαq was not detected at these intracellular locations. Next, tubulin colocalization with Gαq or Gβ was evaluated (Fig, 2, B and C). In unstimulated cells tubulin colocalized with Gαq in the perinuclear area of the cells as well as along microtubules (Fig. 2B). This was concordant with previous observations demonstrating Gαi1, Gαs, and Gαo decoration of microtubules in cell-free system and in PC12 cells (6Roychowdhury S. Panda D. Wilson L. Rasenick M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13485-13490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 41Sarma T. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T. Hope T.J. Rasenick M.M. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 848-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Gβ sparsely colocalized with tubulin in untreated SK-N-SH cells. However, 2 min after carbachol addition, tubulin associated with the plasma membrane and colocalized with both Gαq and Gβ (Fig, 2, B and C). Fifteen minutes post-carbachol, significant colocalization of tubulin and Gβ, but not Gαq, was observed in vesicles in the cytosol. Gαq was again seen along microtubules. Magnified images of SK-N-SH cells are shown to underline the differences between tubulin/Gβ and tubulin/Gαq colocalization during the course of carbachol stimulation (Fig. 2D). These findings confirmed the biochemical observations showing a correlation between tubulin and Gβ, but not Gαq translocation to the cytosol (Fig. 1). It appeared that the pool of cytosolic Gαq was different from that at the plasma membrane, since membrane Gαq did not appear to internalize in response to agonist stimulation (Refs. 39McConalogue K. Corvera C.U. Gamp P.D. Grady E.F. Bunnett N.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2305-2324Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar and 40Hughes T.E. Zhang H. Logothetis D.E. Berlot C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4227-4235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar and herein). Thus, it appeared that tubulin engaged in revolving interactions with Gαq and Gβγ during the course of PLCβ1 signaling. Tubulin and Gβ Internalize through Clathrin-mediated Endocytic Mechanism—Both biochemical and cellular imaging approaches were utilized to identify the nature of endocytic vesicles containing tubulin and Gβγ. The Gαq-coupled m3 muscarinic receptors of neuroblastoma cells internalize through clathrin-mediated endocytosis (42Slowiejko D.M. McEwen E.L. Ernst S.A. Fisher S.K. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 186-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We tested whether tubulin and/or Gβγ utilized this endocytic pathway. Clathrin presence at the membrane and in the cytosol was investigated during the course of carbachol stimulation of intact SK-N-SH cells (Fig. 3). A striking similarity with the pattern of translocation of tubulin and Gβ was observed. Similarly to tubulin, clathrin association with the membrane increased within 2 min of carbachol addition (220%, n = 4). Moreover, clathrin translocated back to the cytosol after 10 min of agonist stimulation, as did tubulin and Gβ (Fig. 1). These results suggested agonist-dependent internalization of tubulin and Gβ with the clathrin-coated vesicles. Clathrin colocalization with tubulin and Gβ in SK-N-SH cells was studied by confocal microscopy (Fig. 4). Gαq was used as negative control, since it did not internalize (43Sorensen S.D. Linseman D.A. Fisher S.K. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 372: 325-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In untreated cells clathrin did not colocalize with tubulin, Gβ, or Gαq. However, 2 min after carbachol addition, clathrin translocated to the plasma membrane and colocalized with Gαq and Gβ (Fig. 4, B and C) as well as membrane-associated tubulin (Fig. 4A). Although areas of colocalization of clathrin and Gαq were broad and not well defined, colocalization with tubulin and Gβ was found in pit-like regions of the plasma membrane. Vesicles containing clathrin and Gβ as well as clathrin and tubulin were also observed in proximity to the cellular cortex. Fifteen minutes after carbachol stimulation, both tubulin and Gβ were seen in clathrin-coated vesicles throughout the cytosol (Fig. 4, A and B). Gαq was not present in these cellular structures (Fig. 4C). All carbachol-mediated processes were inhibited by atropine (10 μm). Thus, internalization of membrane-associated tubulin and Gβ appeared to proceed through clathrin-mediated endocytosis. To test if clathrin, tubulin, and Gβγ were internalized together, coimmunoprecipitation of clathrin with tubulin, Gβ, or Gαq from the cytosol of SK-N-SH cells was tested before and 15 min after carbachol stimulation (Fig. 5). Tubulin, but not Gβ, coimmunoprecipi"
https://openalex.org/W2097409273,"Myocardium undergoing remodeling in vivo exhibits insulin resistance that has been attributed to a shift from the insulin-sensitive glucose transporter GLUT4 to the fetal, less insulin-sensitive, isoform GLUT1. To elucidate the role of altered GLUT4 expression in myocardial insulin resistance, glucose uptake and the expression of the glucose transporter isoforms GLUT4 and GLUT1 were measured in adult rat cardiomyocytes (ARC). ARC in culture spontaneously undergo dedifferentiation, hypertrophy-like spreading, and return to a fetal-like gene expression pattern. Insulin stimulation of 2-deoxy-D-glucose uptake was completely abolished on day 2 and 3 of culture and recovered thereafter. Although GLUT4 protein level was reduced, the time-course of unresponsiveness to insulin did not correlate with altered expression of GLUT1 and GLUT4. However, translocation of GLUT4 to the sarcolemma in response to insulin was completely abolished during transient insulin resistance. Insulin-mediated phosphorylation of Akt was not reduced, indicating that activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) was preserved. On the other hand, total and phosphorylated Cbl was reduced during insulin resistance, suggesting that activation of Cbl/CAP is essential for insulin-mediated GLUT4 translocation, in addition to activation of PI3K. Pharmacological inhibition of contraction in insulin-sensitive ARC reduced insulin sensitivity and lowered phosphorylated Cbl. The results suggest that transient insulin resistance in ARC is related to impairment of GLUT4 translocation. A defect in the PI3K-independent insulin signaling pathway involving Cbl seems to contribute to reduced insulin responsiveness and may be related to contractile arrest."

https://openalex.org/W1970916202,"Motor proteins such as myosin and kinesin are responsible for actively directed movement in vivo. The physicochemical mechanism underlying their function is still obscure. A novel and unifying model concerning the motors driving mechanism is suggested here. This model resides within the framework of the well-studied ""swinging lever-arm"" hypothesis, stating that cis/trans peptide bond isomerization (CTI) is a key stage in the chemo-mechanical coupling within actomyosin--the complex of the motor (myosin) and its specific track (actin). CTI is suggested to propel myosin's lever-arm swing. The model addresses on the submolecular level a broad spectrum of actomyosin's functional characteristics, such as kinetics, energetics, force exertion, stepping, and directionality. The model may be tested first with relative ease in kinesin--a smaller motor that could be specifically modified with unnatural amino acids using bacterial expression. Suggested modifications may be used for labeling and functional decoupling."

https://openalex.org/W2020199931,"Meningiomas are common central nervous system tumors; however, the mechanisms underlying their pathogenesis are largely unknown. Collaborative studies from our laboratory demonstrated a direct association of 14-3-3 with the meningioma tumor suppressor Protein 4.1B, which was not observed with other members of the Protein 4.1 family, including the NF2 meningioma tumor suppressor, merlin/schwannomin. Given the role of 14-3-3 in the regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis, we sought to determine the functional significance of 14-3-3 binding to Protein 4.1B growth suppression. Based on comparative binding studies performed with additional members of the Protein 4.1 family, we generated specific missense mutations within the minimal growth suppressor fragment of Protein 4.1B (DAL-1, differentially expressed in adenocarcinoma of the lung). Complementary in vitro GST affinity chromatography and in vivo interaction experiments demonstrated that the F359Y mutation abrogated binding to 14-3-3, but did not impair DAL-1 binding to other known Protein 4.1B interacting proteins. Similar to wild-type DAL-1, the expression of the F359Y DAL-1 14-3-3-binding mutant resulted in reduced Protein 4.1B-deficient IOMM-Lee and CH157-MN meningioma cell line colony formation. Moreover, similar to wild-type DAL-1, the stable expression of the DAL-1 F359Y mutant significantly reduced cell proliferation in independently isolated IOMM-Lee clones, as assessed by thymidine incorporation. Collectively, these results suggest that binding to 14-3-3 is not essential for the growth suppressor function of Protein 4.1B in meningiomas."
