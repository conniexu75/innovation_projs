https://openalex.org/W2920097475,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by KRAS- and autophagy-dependent tumorigenic growth, but the role of KRAS in supporting autophagy has not been established. We show that, to our surprise, suppression of KRAS increased autophagic flux, as did pharmacological inhibition of its effector ERK MAPK. Furthermore, we demonstrate that either KRAS suppression or ERK inhibition decreased both glycolytic and mitochondrial functions. We speculated that ERK inhibition might thus enhance PDAC dependence on autophagy, in part by impairing other KRAS- or ERK-driven metabolic processes. Accordingly, we found that the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine and genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of specific autophagy regulators synergistically enhanced the ability of ERK inhibitors to mediate antitumor activity in KRAS-driven PDAC. We conclude that combinations of pharmacologic inhibitors that concurrently block both ERK MAPK and autophagic processes that are upregulated in response to ERK inhibition may be effective treatments for PDAC."
https://openalex.org/W2920147611,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) was responsible for ~ 44,000 deaths in the United States in 2018 and is the epitome of a recalcitrant cancer driven by a pharmacologically intractable oncoprotein, KRAS1-4. Downstream of KRAS, the RAF→MEK→ERK signaling pathway plays a central role in pancreatic carcinogenesis5. However, paradoxically, inhibition of this pathway has provided no clinical benefit to patients with PDA6. Here we show that inhibition of KRAS→RAF→MEK→ERK signaling elicits autophagy, a process of cellular recycling that protects PDA cells from the cytotoxic effects of KRAS pathway inhibition. Mechanistically, inhibition of MEK1/2 leads to activation of the LKB1→AMPK→ULK1 signaling axis, a key regulator of autophagy. Furthermore, combined inhibition of MEK1/2 plus autophagy displays synergistic anti-proliferative effects against PDA cell lines in vitro and promotes regression of xenografted patient-derived PDA tumors in mice. The observed effect of combination trametinib plus chloroquine was not restricted to PDA as other tumors, including patient-derived xenografts (PDX) of NRAS-mutated melanoma and BRAF-mutated colorectal cancer displayed similar responses. Finally, treatment of a patient with PDA with the combination of trametinib plus hydroxychloroquine resulted in a partial, but nonetheless striking disease response. These data suggest that this combination therapy may represent a novel strategy to target RAS-driven cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2918546246,"Overexpression of the B7-H1 (PD-L1) molecule in the tumor microenvironment (TME) is a major immune evasion mechanism in some patients with cancer, and antibody blockade of the B7-H1/PD-1 interaction can normalize compromised immunity without excessive side-effects. Using a genome-scale T cell activity array, we identified Siglec-15 as a critical immune suppressor. While only expressed on some myeloid cells normally, Siglec-15 is broadly upregulated on human cancer cells and tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells, and its expression is mutually exclusive to B7-H1, partially due to its induction by macrophage colony-stimulating factor and downregulation by IFN-γ. We demonstrate that Siglec-15 suppresses antigen-specific T cell responses in vitro and in vivo. Genetic ablation or antibody blockade of Siglec-15 amplifies anti-tumor immunity in the TME and inhibits tumor growth in some mouse models. Taken together, our results support Siglec-15 as a potential target for normalization cancer immunotherapy."

https://openalex.org/W2918786033,"Cancer cells can evade immune surveillance through the expression of inhibitory ligands that bind their cognate receptors on immune effector cells. Expression of programmed death ligand 1 in tumor microenvironments is a major immune checkpoint for tumor-specific T cell responses as it binds to programmed cell death protein-1 on activated and dysfunctional T cells1. The activity of myeloid cells such as macrophages and neutrophils is likewise regulated by a balance between stimulatory and inhibitory signals. In particular, cell surface expression of the CD47 protein creates a 'don't eat me' signal on tumor cells by binding to SIRPα expressed on myeloid cells2-5. Using a haploid genetic screen, we here identify glutaminyl-peptide cyclotransferase-like protein (QPCTL) as a major component of the CD47-SIRPα checkpoint. Biochemical analysis demonstrates that QPCTL is critical for pyroglutamate formation on CD47 at the SIRPα binding site shortly after biosynthesis. Genetic and pharmacological interference with QPCTL activity enhances antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis and cellular cytotoxicity of tumor cells. Furthermore, interference with QPCTL expression leads to a major increase in neutrophil-mediated killing of tumor cells in vivo. These data identify QPCTL as a novel target to interfere with the CD47 pathway and thereby augment antibody therapy of cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2920347438,"Cancer genomes are frequently characterized by numerical and structural chromosomal abnormalities. Here we integrated a centromere-specific inactivation approach with selection for a conditionally essential gene, a strategy termed CEN-SELECT, to systematically interrogate the structural landscape of mis-segregated chromosomes. We show that single-chromosome mis-segregation into a micronucleus can directly trigger a broad spectrum of genomic rearrangement types. Cytogenetic profiling revealed that mis-segregated chromosomes exhibit 120-fold-higher susceptibility to developing seven major categories of structural aberrations, including translocations, insertions, deletions, and complex reassembly through chromothripsis coupled to classical non-homologous end joining. Whole-genome sequencing of clonally propagated rearrangements identified random patterns of clustered breakpoints with copy-number alterations resulting in interspersed gene deletions and extrachromosomal DNA amplification events. We conclude that individual chromosome segregation errors during mitotic cell division are sufficient to drive extensive structural variations that recapitulate genomic features commonly associated with human disease. Cytogenetic and whole-genome-sequencing analyses using CEN-SELECT show that mitotic segregation errors generate a broad spectrum of chromosomal aberrations that recapitulate the complex structural features of cancer genomes."
https://openalex.org/W2920321168,"We introduce a deceptively simple behavioral task that robustly identifies two qualitatively different groups within the general population. When presented with an isochronous train of random syllables, some listeners are compelled to align their own concurrent syllable production with the perceived rate, whereas others remain impervious to the external rhythm. Using both neurophysiological and structural imaging approaches, we show group differences with clear consequences for speech processing and language learning. When listening passively to speech, high synchronizers show increased brain-to-stimulus synchronization over frontal areas, and this localized pattern correlates with precise microstructural differences in the white matter pathways connecting frontal to auditory regions. Finally, the data expose a mechanism that underpins performance on an ecologically relevant word-learning task. We suggest that this task will help to better understand and characterize individual performance in speech processing and language learning."

https://openalex.org/W2920624726,"Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) that is released from the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus is essential for mediating stress response by activating the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. CRF-releasing PVN neurons receive inputs from multiple brain regions that convey stressful events, but their neuronal dynamics on the timescale of behavior remain unknown. Here, our recordings of PVN CRF neuronal activity in freely behaving mice revealed that CRF neurons are activated immediately by a range of aversive stimuli. By contrast, CRF neuronal activity starts to drop within a second of exposure to appetitive stimuli. Optogenetic activation or inhibition of PVN CRF neurons was sufficient to induce a conditioned place aversion or preference, respectively. Furthermore, conditioned place aversion or preference induced by natural stimuli was significantly decreased by manipulating PVN CRF neuronal activity. Together, these findings suggest that the rapid, biphasic responses of PVN CRF neurons encode the positive and negative valences of stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W2920638932,"Celastrol, a pentacyclic triterpene, is the most potent antiobesity agent that has been reported thus far1. The mechanism of celastrol's leptin-sensitizing and antiobesity effects has not yet been elucidated. In this study, we identified interleukin-1 receptor 1 (IL1R1) as a mediator of celastrol's action by using temporally resolved analysis of the hypothalamic transcriptome in celastrol-treated DIO, lean, and db/db mice. We demonstrate that IL1R1-deficient mice are completely resistant to the effects of celastrol in leptin sensitization and treatment of obesity, diabetes, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Thus, we conclude that IL1R1 is a gatekeeper for celastrol's metabolic actions."
https://openalex.org/W2920401451,"Plant growth regulators (PGRs) and plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPRs) play an important role in mitigating abiotic stresses. However, little is known about the parallel changes in physiological processes coupled with metabolic changes induced by PGRs and PGPRs that help to cope with drought stress in chickpeas. The present investigation was carried out to study the integrative effects of PGRs and PGPRs on the physiological and metabolic changes, and their association with drought tolerance in two chickpea genotypes. Inoculated seeds of two chickpea genotypes, Punjab Noor-2009 (drought sensitive) and 93127 (drought tolerance), were planted in greenhouse condition at the University of Florida. Prior to sowing, seeds of two chickpea varieties were soaked for 3 h in 24 h old cultures of PGPRs (Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus thuringiensis, and Bacillus megaterium), whereas, some of the seeds were soaked in distilled water for the same period of time and were treated as control. Plant growth regulators, salicylic acid (SA) and putrescine (Put), were applied on 25 days old seedlings just prior to the induction of drought stress. Drought stress was imposed by withholding the supply of water on 25-day-old seedlings (at the three-leaf stage) and continued for the next 25 days until the soil water content reached 14%. Ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (UPLC-HRMS) analysis concomitant with physiological parameters were carried out in chickpea leaves at two-time points i.e. 14 and 25 d after imposition of drought stress. The results showed that both genotypes, treated with PGRs and PGPRs (consortium), performed significantly better under drought condition through enhanced leaf relative water content (RWC), greater biomass of shoot and root, higher Fv/FM ratio and higher accumulation of protein, sugar and phenolic compounds. The sensitive genotype was more responsive than tolerant one. The results revealed that the accumulation of succinate, leucine, disaccharide, saccharic acid and glyceric acid was consistently higher in both genotypes at both time points due to PGRs and PGPRs treatment. Significant accumulation of malonate, 5-oxo-L-proline, and trans-cinnamate occurred at both time points only in the tolerant genotype following the consortium treatment. Aminoacyl-tRNA, primary and secondary metabolite biosynthesis, amino acid metabolism or synthesis pathways, and energy cycle were significantly altered due to PGRs and PGPRs treatment. It is inferred that changes in different physiological and metabolic parameters induced by PGRs and PGPRs treatment could confer drought tolerance in chickpeas."
https://openalex.org/W2918853470,"The retinoblastoma protein (RB) restricts cell cycle gene expression and entry into the cell cycle. The RB-related protein p130 forms the DREAM (DP, RB-like, E2F, and MuvB) complex and contributes to repression of cell cycle-dependent genes during quiescence. Although both RB and DREAM bind and repress an overlapping set of E2F-dependent gene promoters, it remains unclear whether they cooperate to restrict cell cycle entry. To test the specific contributions of RB and DREAM, we generated RB and p130 knockout cells in primary human fibroblasts. Knockout of both p130 and RB yielded higher levels of cell cycle gene expression in G0 and G1 cells compared to cells with knockout of RB alone, indicating a role for DREAM and RB in repression of cell cycle genes. We observed that RB had a dominant role in E2F-dependent gene repression during mid to late G1 while DREAM activity was more prominent during G0 and early G1. Cyclin D-Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4 (CDK4)-dependent phosphorylation of p130 occurred during early G1, and led to the release of p130 and MuvB from E2F4 and decreased p130 and MuvB binding to cell cycle promoters. Specific inhibition of CDK4 activity by palbociclib blocked DREAM complex disassembly during cell cycle entry. In addition, sensitivity to CDK4 inhibition was dependent on RB and an intact DREAM complex in both normal cells as well as in palbociclib-sensitive cancer cell lines. Although RB knockout cells were partially resistant to CDK4 inhibition, RB and p130 double knockout cells were significantly more resistant to palbociclib treatment. These results indicate that DREAM cooperates with RB in repressing E2F-dependent gene expression and cell cycle entry and supports a role for DREAM as a therapeutic target in cancer."

Arabidopsis thaliana controls pathogen entry through the penetration-resistance genes PEN2 and PEN3, encoding an atypical myrosinase and an ABC transporter, respectively, required for synthesis and export of unknown indole compounds. To identify pathogen-elicited leaf surface metabolites and further unravel nonhost resistance in Arabidopsis, we performed untargeted metabolite profiling by incubating a P. infestans zoospore suspension on leaves of WT or pen3 mutant Arabidopsis plants. Among the plant-secreted metabolites, 4-methoxyindol-3-yl-methanol and S-(4-methoxy-indol-3-yl-methyl) cysteine were detected in spore suspensions recollected from WT plants, but at reduced levels from the pen3 mutant plants. In both whole-cell and microsome-based assays, 4-methoxyindol-3-yl-methanol was transported in a PEN3-dependent manner, suggesting that this compound is a PEN3 substrate. The syntheses of both compounds were dependent on functional PEN2 and phytochelatin synthase 1. None of these compounds inhibited mycelial growth of P. infestans in vitro. Of note, exogenous application of 4-methoxyindol-3-yl methanol slightly elevated cytosolic Ca2+ levels and enhanced callose deposition in hydathodes of seedlings treated with a bacterial pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP), flagellin (flg22). Loss of flg22-induced callose deposition in leaves of pen3 seedlings was partially reverted by the addition of 4-methoxyindol-3-yl methanol.

Phytophthora infestans is the causal agent of late blight, economically the most important potato disease. In an attempt to understand resistance against infection by this oomycete, attention has turned to nonhost pathosystems, such as the interaction of Arabidopsis thaliana and P. infestans (1Kamoun S.

Comparative analyses of the metabolic profiles revealed the presence of more than 1000 features significantly increased in zoospore suspension droplets recollected from Col-0 plants compared with the control. Up to 25% of these features could also be detected in a spore suspension without contact to plant leaves. Some of the spore suspension–derived compounds were tentatively annotated using an in-house analyte list as metabolites from the primary metabolism (sugars, phosphosugars, organic acids, amino acids, polyamines, purine derivatives and degradation products, and pipecolic acid (Table S1)). They could originate from the germinating spores, but also from the medium used for P. infestans cultivation. From the exclusively plant-derived features significantly increased in the treatment group, 18 recurring features could be annotated by accurate tandem MS analyses (Table 1 and Fig. 2A).Table 1Analytical data of compounds detected by UPLC/ESI-QTOF MS in P. infestans spore suspension recollected after 24 h from A. thaliana WT leavesAnnotationElemental compositionRetention timeQuantifier ionAnnotation levelTypem/zTypem/zminCamalexinC11H8N2S6.6[M + H] +201.0481[M − H] −199.03351Dihydrocamalexic acid (DHCA)C12H10N2O2S3.8[M + H] +247.0536[M − H] −245.03901*2-Foramidophenyl-2′-thiazolylketoneC11H8N2O2S6.0[M + H] +233.03791*Indol-3-ylmethyl amine (I3MA)C9H10N21.9[M + H-NH3] +130.06511Indol-3-carboxylic acid (I3COOH)C9H7NO24.7[M + H] +162.0550[M − H] −160.04041Methyl indole-3-carboxylate (I3COOMe)C10H9NO26.6[M − H] −174.05611-Methyl-indole-3-carboxylic acid (1MeI3COOH)C10H9NO25.9[M + H] +176.07061Indole-3-carbaldehyde (I3CHO)C9H7NO4.8[M + H] +146.0600[M − H] −144.045014-Hydroxyindole-3-carbaldehyde (4OHI3CHO)C9H7NO25.1[M + H] +162.0550[M − H] −160.04041p-Coumaroylagmatine (cis/trans)C14H20N4O22.9/3.3[M + H] +277.16591Kaempferol 3,7-di-O-α-Rha (K 3,7-Rha2)C27H30O144.7[M + H] +579.1708[M − H] −577.15622Kaempferol 3-O-β-Glc-7-O-α-Rha (K 3-Glc-7-Rha)C27H30O154.3[M + H] +595.1658[M − H] −593.15112SinapoylmalateC15H16O94.6[M + H − C4H6O5] +207.0652[M − H] −339.07202ScopoletinC10H8O44.5[M + H] +193.0495[M − H] −191.03501S-(4-Methoxyindol-3-ylmethyl)cysteineC13H17N2O3S4.2[M + H] +281.091*4-Methoxyindol-3-ylmethanolC10H11NO25.0[M + Na] +200.061*8-Methylsulphinyloctyl (NHCOSMe)C11H23NO2S25.9[M + Na] +288.1062-2Leucyl-proline (H-Leu-Pro-OH)C11H20N2O32.5[M + H] +229.1546[M − H] −227.13901* Open table in a new tab The extracellular occurrence of camalexin, 2-formamidophenyl-2′-thiazolylketone, and two unknown camalexin compounds was reported before (16Böttcher C.

Here, additional compounds were detected and identified, which accumulated in P. infestans droplets but not in water controls (Table 1). Among these was the hydroxycinnamic acid amide coumaroylagmatine, exported by the MATE transporter DTX18 (17Dobritzsch M. Lübken T. Eschen-Lippold L. Gorzolka K. Blum E. Matern A. Marillonnet S.

In addition, indolic compounds, such as indol-3-ylmethyl amine (I3MA), indole-3-carbaldehyde (I3CHO), indole-3-carboxylic acid (I3COOH), indole-3-carboxyl-methyl ester (I3COOMe), 1-methyl indole-3-carboxylic acid (1MeI3COOH) and 4-hydroxyindole-3-carbaldehyde (4OHI3CHO) were detectable. Importantly, two novel compounds were identified as substances exported in response to P. infestans challenge (Table 1). Based on comparison of chromatographic and mass spectral properties (Fig. S1) with synthetic standards that have been authenticated by 1H and 13C NMR, these were identified as S-(4-methoxy-indol-3-ylmethyl) cysteine (4MeOI3Cys) and 4MeOI3M. A hypothetical pathway leading to the synthesis of the various indole compounds (Fig. 1) was generated based on data from the literature (6Bednarek P. Pislewska-Bednarek M. Svatos A. Schneider B.

Central to the synthesis of camalexin, as well as I3CHO and I3COOH, is indoleacetonitrile (IAN), which is formed from tryptophan through the action of CYP79B2/B3 and CYP71A13 (20Nafisi M. Goregaoker S. Botanga C.J. Glawischnig E. Olsen C.E. Halkier B.A. Glazebrook J.

As proposed by Böttcher et al. (16Böttcher C. Westphal L. Schmotz C. Prade E. Scheel D. Glawischnig E. The multifunctional enzyme CYP71B15 (PHYTOALEXIN DEFICIENT3) converts cysteine-indole-3-acetonitrile to camalexin in the indole-3-acetonitrile metabolic network of Arabidopsis thaliana.Plant Cell. 2009; 21 (19567706): 1830-184510.1105/tpc.109.066670Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), camalexin synthesis proceeds via oxidation of IAN followed by the addition of GSH to IAN, possibly by a GSH-S-transferase, and removal of glycine and glutamic acid by peptidases or GSH γ-glutamylcysteinyltransferase 1 (CAD1, PCS1) to yield Cys(IAN), which is converted by CYP71B15 (PAD3) to dihydrocamalexic acid (DHCA) and camalexin. IAN is also one possible precursor for I3CHO and I3COOH, which are synthesized by CYP71B6/CYP71A12 and AAO1 (18Böttcher C. Chapman A. Fellermeier F. Choudhary M. Scheel D. Glawischnig E. The biosynthetic pathway of indole-3-carbaldehyde and indole-3-carboxylic acid derivatives in Arabidopsis.Plant Physiol. 2014; 165 (24728709): 841-85310.1104/pp.114.235630Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) or CYP71A12 and FOX1 followed by hydrolysis or, for I3COOMe, methanolysis during sample preparation (19Rajniak J.

Indole compounds derived from the PEN2 pathway are degradation products of indole glucosinolates. PEN2 has been shown to cleave both I3G and 4MeOI3G in vitro (6Bednarek P. Pislewska-Bednarek M. Svatos A. Schneider B. Doubsky J. Mansurova M. Humphry M. Consonni C. Panstruga R. Sanchez-Vallet A. Molina A. Schulze-Lefert P.

The newly discovered compounds 4MeOI3Cys and 4MeOI3M are hypothesized to be derived from the primary PEN2 product, 4-methoxyindol-3-ylmethyl isothiocyanate. Due to its reactivity, this isothiocyanate can be directly hydrolyzed to give 4MeOI3M or, by yet unidentified enzymes, converted to 4MeOI3Cys. Because the pcs1 mutant cad1-3 shows enhanced penetration of P. infestans (21Kühnlenz T. Westphal L. Schmidt H. Scheel D. Clemens S. Expression of Caenorhabditis elegans PCS in the AtPCS1-deficient Arabidopsis thaliana cad1-3 mutant separates the metal tolerance and non-host resistance functions of phytochelatin synthases.Plant Cell Environ. 2015; 38 (25764348): 2239-224710.1111/pce.12534Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), involvement of the phytochelatin synthase 1 (PCS1) in proteolytic processing of an intermediate can be hypothesized. To identify PEN2-derived metabolites that accumulate extracellularly in a PEN3-dependent manner, untargeted metabolite profiling was performed using P. infestans-inoculated pen2-1 mutant plants and the respective WT gl1, as well as pen3-1 (8Stein M.

Metabolite profiling was performed of the inoculum incubated on leaves for 24 h and of methanolic extracts of the infected leaf tissue below the inoculum, to detect extracellular and tissue-associated metabolites, respectively. For each feature delivered by the peak picking algorithm, a Student’s t test was calculated comparing each mutant to its respective WT. Several compounds increased more than 2-fold in the mutants (Fig. 2B and Table S2), whereas the number of features with a significantly higher accumulation in the WT, which may comprise the PEN3 substrates, was very low (Fig. 2B). To avoid false positive results, only features were considered that differentially accumulated in the same manner throughout several experimental repetitions. For the potential PEN3 substrates, these were only seven metabolites (Table 2).Table 2Compounds detected by UPLC/ESI-QTOF MS in P. infestans spore suspension recollected after 24 h from A. thaliana leaves, which were significantly increased in WT compared with pen3AnnotationElemental compositionRetention timeChange pen3/Col-0Quantifier ion m/z typeQuantifier ion m/zAnnotation levelPresent in pen2min-fold(E)-p-CoumaroylagmatineC14H20N4O23.3−9.6[M + H] +277.165471*ReducedS-(4-Methoxyindol-3-ylmethyl) cysteineC13H17N2O3S4.22−3.2[M + H] +281.09421*No4-Methoxyindol-3-yl methanolC10H11NO25.03−3.7[M + H] +160.074991*No4-Hydroxyindole-3-carbaldehyde (4OHI3CHO)C9H7NO25.1−3.0[M + H] +162.055191NoUnknown indole 1C10H9NO25.57−2.5[M + H] +176.071163NoUnknown indole 2C10H9NO6.01−4.1[M + H] +160.075343NoUnknown indole 3C10H9NO26.68−3.6[M + H] +176.070543Reduced Open table in a new tab Candidates for possible PEN3 substrates and further identified compounds involved in the defense against P. infestans (Table 1, Table 2) were quantified in targeted LC-MS analyses in WTs and mutants. Both intra- and extracellularly, camalexin was present in significantly higher amounts in all mutants analyzed, pen3-1, cad1-3, and pen2-1, compared with their respective WTs (Figs. 3 and S2). There were no differences in the levels of I3G (data not shown). I3CHO was present at very low amounts in methanolic extracts of P. infestans-inoculated leaves of all lines analyzed (Figs. 3A and S2A). In contrast, extracellular levels of I3CHO were significantly reduced in pen3-1 but not in cad1-3 and pen2-1 plants (Figs. 3B and S2B). Enhanced levels of I3COOH were detected in all mutant leaves. Extracellular levels were drastically enhanced in cad1-3 and pen2-1 plants, but not significantly different in pen3-1 and WT plants. These observations do not suggest a clear dependence of synthesis and secretion of I3CHO and I3COOH on PEN genes. The reduced levels of I3MA and raphanusamic acid in pen2-1 plants suggested that these compounds are downstream products of the PEN2-mediated reaction (6Bednarek P. Pislewska-Bednarek M. Svatos A.

https://openalex.org/W2919576566,"Increasing deforestation worldwide has expanded the interfaces between fragmented forests and non-forest habitats. Human-made edges are very different from the original forest cover, with different microclimatic conditions. Conversely, the natural transitions (i.e., ecotones) are distinct from human-made forest edges. The human-made forest edges are usually sharp associated with disturbances, with abrupt changes in temperature, humidity, luminosity and wind incidence towards the forest interior. However, the natural forest-lake ecotones, even when abrupt, are composed of a complex vegetal physiognomy, with canopy structures close to the ground level and a composition of herbaceous and arboreal species well adapted to this transition range. In the present study, fruit-feeding butterflies were used as models to investigate whether faunal assemblages in natural ecotones are more similar to the forest interior than to the anthropic edges. Butterflies were sampled monthly over one year in the Rio Doce State Park, Southeastern Brazil, following a standardized design using a total of 90 bait traps, in three different forest habitats (forest interior, forest ecotone and anthropic edges), in both canopy and understory. A total of 11,594 individuals from 98 butterfly species were collected (3,151 individuals from 79 species in the forest interior, 4,321 individuals from 87 species in the ecotone and 4,122 individuals from 83 species in the edge). The results indicated that the butterfly richness and diversity were higher in transition areas (ecotones and edges). The ecotone included a combination of butterfly species from the forest interior and from anthropic edges. However, species composition and dominance in the ecotone were similar to the forest interior in both vertical strata. These results suggest that human made forest edges are quite distinct from ecotones. Moreover, ecotones represent unique habitats accommodating species adapted to distinct ecological conditions, while anthropic edges accommodate only opportunistic species from open areas or upper canopies."
https://openalex.org/W2919602178,"Potassium (K) channels exhibit exquisite selectivity for conduction of K+ ions over other cations, particularly Na+. High-resolution structures reveal an archetypal selectivity filter (SF) conformation in which dehydrated K+ ions, but not Na+ ions, are perfectly coordinated. Using single-molecule FRET (smFRET), we show that the SF-forming loop (SF-loop) in KirBac1.1 transitions between constrained and dilated conformations as a function of ion concentration. The constrained conformation, essential for selective K+ permeability, is stabilized by K+ but not Na+ ions. Mutations that render channels nonselective result in dilated and dynamically unstable conformations, independent of the permeant ion. Further, while wild-type KirBac1.1 channels are K+ selective in physiological conditions, Na+ permeates in the absence of K+. Moreover, whereas K+ gradients preferentially support 86Rb+ fluxes, Na+ gradients preferentially support 22Na+ fluxes. This suggests differential ion selectivity in constrained versus dilated states, potentially providing a structural basis for this anomalous mole fraction effect."
https://openalex.org/W2919921813,"Despite widespread evidence that nonverbal components of human speech (e.g., voice pitch) communicate information about physical attributes of vocalizers and that listeners can judge traits such as strength and body size from speech, few studies have examined the communicative functions of human nonverbal vocalizations (such as roars, screams, grunts and laughs). Critically, no previous study has yet to examine the acoustic correlates of strength in nonverbal vocalisations, including roars, nor identified reliable vocal cues to strength in human speech. In addition to being less acoustically constrained than articulated speech, agonistic nonverbal vocalizations function primarily to express motivation and emotion, such as threat, and may therefore communicate strength and body size more effectively than speech. Here, we investigated acoustic cues to strength and size in roars compared to screams and speech sentences produced in both aggressive and distress contexts. Using playback experiments, we then tested whether listeners can reliably infer a vocalizer’s actual strength and height from roars, screams, and valenced speech equivalents, and which acoustic features predicted listeners’ judgments. While there were no consistent acoustic cues to strength in any vocal stimuli, listeners accurately judged inter-individual differences in strength, and did so most effectively from aggressive voice stimuli (roars and aggressive speech). In addition, listeners more accurately judged strength from roars than from aggressive speech. In contrast, listeners’ judgments of height were most accurate for speech stimuli. These results support the prediction that vocalizers maximize impressions of physical strength in aggressive compared to distress contexts, and that inter-individual variation in strength may only be honestly communicated in vocalizations that function to communicate threat, particularly roars. Thus, in continuity with nonhuman mammals, the acoustic structure of human aggressive roars may have been selected to communicate, and to some extent exaggerate, functional cues to physical formidability."

It also interacts with klotho, an anti-aging and cognition enhancing protein. Objective To determine if circulating Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is associated with new-onset cognitive outcomes in a community-based cohort of cognitively healthy adults with long-term follow-up. Methods We measured serum FGF23 levels in 1537 [53% women, mean age 68.7 (SD 5.7)] dementia-free Framingham Offspring participants at their 7th quadrennial examination (1998–2001), and followed these participants for the development of clinical all-cause dementia and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Secondary outcomes included MRI-based structural brain measures, and neurocognitive test performance at exam 7. Results During a median (Q1, Q3) 12-year (7.0, 13.3) follow up, 122 (7.9%) participants developed dementia, of whom 91 (5.9%) had AD. Proportional-hazards regression analysis, adjusted for age, sex, education, systolic blood pressure, antihypertensive medication, prevalent cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, smoking status and apoE ε4 carrier status, revealed that higher serum FGF23 levels were associated with an increased risk of incident dementia and AD (Hazard ratio [HR] per 1 standard deviation increment in inverse transformed FGF23 level 1.25, 95% CI 1.02–1.53, and 1.32, 95% CI 1.04–1.69, respectively). There was no significant interaction according to presence/absence of significant renal impairment (eGFR <30 versus ≥30ml/min) and risk of dementia (based on 1537; p = 0.97). Conclusions Higher circulating FGF23 is associated with an increased risk of dementia, suggesting that FGF23-related biological pathways may play a role in the development of dementia."

Here, we investigated the therapeutic effect and regulatory mechanism of the class I HDAC selective inhibitors, MS-275 and RGFP966, in angiotensin (Ang) II-induced hypertensive mice. Methods and results MS-275 inhibited the activity of HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3, while RGFP966 weakly inhibited that of HDAC3 in a cell-free system. MS-275 and RGFP966 treatment reduced systolic blood pressure and thickness of the aorta wall in Ang II-induced hypertensive mice. MS-275 treatment reduced aorta collagen deposition, as determined by Masson’s trichrome staining. MS-275 decreased the components of the renin angiotensin system and increased vascular relaxation of rat aortic rings via the nitric oxide (NO) pathway. NO levels reduced by Ang II were restored by MS-275 treatment in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). However, MS-275 dose (3 mg·kg-1·day-1) was not enough to induce NO production in vivo. In addition, MS-275 did not prevent endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) uncoupling in the aorta of Ang II-induced mice. Treatment with MS-275 failed to inhibit Ang II-induced expression of NADPH oxidase (Nox)1, Nox2, and p47phox. MS-275 treatment reduced proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, as well as adhesion molecules. Histological analysis showed that Ang II-induced macrophage infiltration was reduced by MS-275 and RGFP966 administration. Conclusions Our results indicate that class I HDAC selective inhibitors may be good therapeutic agents for the treatment of hypertension through the regulation of vascular remodeling and vasoconstriction, as well as inflammation."

Results Serum 25(OH)D levels were less than 20ng/mL in 1,486 of 2,030 samples (73.2%). There was an obvious seasonal change, with serum 25(OH)D levels of less than 20 ng/mL in 89.8% and 47.8% of samples in spring (April) and autumn (October), respectively. Both the frequency spent under sunlight and dietary intake of vitamin D were significantly associated with serum 25(OH)D level. An increase in sunlight exposure of more than 15 min for 1 to 2 days per week in non-winter, or dietary intake of 2 μg/day of vitamin D resulted in an elevation of 1 ng/mL in serum 25(OH)D levels. Conclusion These findings indicate that vitamin D deficiency is very severe in Japanese pregnant women, especially those rarely exposed to sunlight. The benefits of UV rays should also be informed of when its risk is alerted, and clinicians should propose the adequate UV exposure level."

Rapid diagnosis of these multiple infections is important for providing timely and effective treatment. To improve diagnosis, in this study, two new multiplex polymerase chain reactions (mPCRs) were developed for simultaneous detection of canine respiratory viruses (CRV) and canine enteric viruses (CEV) using two separate primer mixes. The viruses included canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2), canine distemper virus (CDV), canine influenza virus (CIV), canine parainfluenza virus (CPIV), canine circovirus (CanineCV), canine coronavirus (CCoV) and canine parvovirus (CPV). The sensitivity of the mPCR results showed that the detection limit of both mPCR methods was 1×104 viral copies. Twenty nasal swabs (NS) and 20 anal swabs (AS) collected from dogs with symptoms of respiratory disease or enteric disease were evaluated using the novel mPCR methods as a clinical test. The mPCR protocols, when applied to these respiratory specimens and intestinal samples, could detect 7 viruses simultaneously, allowing rapid investigation of CRV (CAV-2, CDV, CIV and CPIV) and CEV (CAV-2, CanineCV, CCoV and CPV) status and prompt evaluation of coinfection. Our study provides an effective and accurate tool for rapid differential diagnosis and epidemiological surveillance in dogs."

https://openalex.org/W2920069912,"Background Mitochondrial toxicity related to maternal combined antiretroviral treatment (cART) may have an impact on the heart of HIV-exposed uninfected (HEU) fetuses. Our objective was to evaluate fetal cardiovascular and mitochondrial biomarkers in HIV pregnancies. Methods Prospective cohort including 47 HIV-infected and 47 non HIV-infected pregnancies. Fetal echocardiography was performed at 26–32 weeks of pregnancy. Umbilical cord blood and placental tissue were collected to study mitochondrial DNA content (mtDNA) (ratio 12SrRNA/RNAseP) and mitochondrial function (cytochrome c oxidase, COX, enzymatic activity) normalized by mitochondrial content (citrate synthase, CS). Results HEU fetuses showed hypertrophic hearts (left myocardial wall thickness: HIV mean 3.21 mm (SD 0.81) vs. non-HIV 2.72 (0.42), p = 0.012), with signs of systolic and diastolic dysfunction (isovolumic relaxation time: HIV 52.2 ms (8.85) vs. non-HIV 42.5 ms (7.30); p<0.001). Cord blood mitochondrial content was significantly increased in HIV-exposed fetuses (CS activity: HIV 82.9 nmol/min.mg of protein (SD 40.5) vs. non-HIV 56.7 nmol/min.mg of protein (28.4); p = 0.007), with no differences in mtDNA content and COX activity. Both myocardial and mitochondrial mass parameters were significantly associated with zidovudine exposure. Conclusions HEU fetuses showed signs of increased myocardial and mitochondrial mass associated with maternal zidovudine treatment, suggesting a fetal adaptive response to cART toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2919419361,"α1-Antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is an inherited disease characterized by emphysema and liver disease. AATD is most often caused by a single amino acid substitution at position 342 in the mature protein, resulting in the Z mutation of the AAT gene (ZAAT). This substitution is associated with misfolding and accumulation of ZAAT in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of hepatocytes, causing a toxic gain of function. ERdj3 is an ER luminal DnaJ homologue, which, along with calreticulin, directly interacts with misfolded ZAAT. We hypothesize that depletion of each of these chaperones will change the fate of ZAAT polymers. Our study demonstrates that calreticulin modulation reveals a novel ZAAT degradation mechanism mediated by exosomes. Using human PiZZ hepatocytes and K42, a mouse calreticulin-deficient fibroblast cell line, our results show ERdj3 and calreticulin directly interact with ZAAT in PiZZ hepatocytes. Silencing calreticulin induces calcium independent ZAAT–ERdj3 secretion through the exosome pathway. This co-secretion decreases ZAAT aggregates within the ER of hepatocytes. We demonstrate that calreticulin has an inhibitory effect on exosome-mediated ZAAT–ERdj3 secretion. This is a novel ZAAT degradation process that involves a DnaJ homologue chaperone bound to ZAAT. In this context, calreticulin modulation may eliminate the toxic gain of function associated with aggregation of ZAAT in lung and liver, thus providing a potential new therapeutic approach to the treatment of AATD-related liver disease. α1-Antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is an inherited disease characterized by emphysema and liver disease.

https://openalex.org/W2918332900,"Background and purpose Architecture of the cerebral network has been shown to associate with IQ in children with epilepsy. However, subject-level prediction on this basis, a crucial step toward harnessing network analyses for the benefit of children with epilepsy, has yet to be achieved. We compared two network normalization strategies in terms of their ability to optimize subject-level inferences on the relationship between brain network architecture and brain function. Materials and methods Patients with epilepsy and resting state fMRI were retrospectively identified. Brain network nodes were defined by anatomic parcellation, first in patient space (nodes defined for each patient) and again in template space (same nodes for all patients). Whole-brain weighted graphs were constructed according to pair-wise correlation of BOLD-signal time courses between nodes. The following metrics were then calculated: clustering coefficient, transitivity, modularity, path length, and global efficiency. Metrics computed on graphs in patient space were normalized to the same metric computed on a random network of identical size. A machine learning algorithm was used to predict patient IQ given access to only the network metrics. Results Twenty-seven patients (8–18 years) comprised the final study group. All brain networks demonstrated expected small world properties. Accounting for intrinsic population heterogeneity had a significant effect on prediction accuracy. Specifically, transformation of all patients into a common standard space as well as normalization of metrics to those computed on a random network both substantially outperformed the use of non-normalized metrics. Conclusion Normalization contributed significantly to accurate subject-level prediction of cognitive function in children with epilepsy. These findings support the potential for quantitative network approaches to contribute clinically meaningful information in children with neurological disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2919813537,"Prions in eukaryotes have been linked to diseases, evolutionary capacitance, large-scale genetic control and long-term memory formation. In bacteria, constructed prion-forming proteins have been described, such as the prion-forming protein recently described for Clostridium botulinum transcription terminator Rho. Here, I analyzed the evolution of the Rho prion-forming domain across bacteria, and discovered that its conservation is sporadic both in the Clostridium genus and in bacteria generally. Nonetheless, it has an apparent evolutionary reach into eight or more different bacterial phyla. Motivated by these results, I investigated whether this pattern of wide-ranging evolutionary sporadicity is typical of bacterial prion-like domains. A measure of coverage of a domain (C) within its evolutionary range was derived, which is effectively a weighted fraction of the number of species in which the domain is found. I observe that occurrence across multiple phyla is not uncommon for bacterial prion-like protein domain families, but that they tend to sample of a low fraction of species within their evolutionary range, like Rho. The Rho prion-like domain family is one of the top three most widely distributed prion-like protein domain families in terms of number of phyla. There are >60 prion-like protein domain families that have at least the evolutionary coverage of Rho, and are found in multiple phyla. The implications of these findings for evolution and for experimental investigations into prion-forming proteins are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2919414476,"The Temperate Highland Peat Swamps on Sandstone of the Sydney Basin occur in the headwaters of Sydney's drinking water catchments and are listed as endangered ecosystems, yet they have suffered habitat losses and degradation due to human impacts such as urbanisation. Despite ongoing efforts to restore and better protect upland swamps, they remain poorly understood, potentially hindering the effectiveness of management efforts. Essential to overall ecosystem function and the provision of services for human and environmental benefit are the microbial component of wetland ecosystems. In the case of these swamps, the microbes, have not yet been studied. Here, we investigated differences in the microbial community of upland swamps in urbanised catchments compared to swamps from natural catchments in the Blue Mountains. A total of twelve swamps were sampled, six from within urbanised catchments and six with intact vegetation catchments, to compare sediment conditions and microbial community and genes expression and abundances. Catchment impervious area and number of stormwater drains entering a swamp, indicators for urbanisation, positively correlated with the pH and ammonium concentration of swamp sediment. Community analysis of the 16S rRNA gene (T-RFLP, qPCR) revealed the elevated pH of urbanised swamps coincided with changes to the abundance of bacteria and archaea. Furthermore, RT-qPCR revealed genes involved in carbon cycling (mcrA & pmoA) were more likely to be found in urbanised swamps. Taken together, our results indicate that urbanisation of the Blue Mountains is impacting the environmental services provided by the microbial community of upland swamps in the Sydney Basin."

Logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the characteristics associated with having a positive QFT-Plus result. Sensitivity, both overall and in subgroups of pulmonary TB only (PTB), extra-pulmonary TB (EPTB) only, and both PTB and EPTB were calculated.Of 222 children with available QFT-Plus results, 33 were classified as confirmed TB, of whom 18 had QFT-Plus (+) and 15 had QFT-Plus (-). Multiple logistic regression modeling suggested that age, history of TB, and confirmed TB were significantly associated with having a positive QFT-Plus result with an area under the ROC curve of 0.77. QFT-Plus sensitivity in PTB only, EPTB, and both PTB and EPTB patients was 84.2%, 14.3% and 14.3%, respectively.

Although a number of approaches have been proposed for sensitivity analysis, they still have limitations in exhaustivity and interpretability. In this study, we propose a novel methodology for sensitivity analysis of agent-based simulation, MASSIVE (Massively parallel Agent-based Simulations and Subsequent Interactive Visualization-based Exploration). MASSIVE takes a unique paradigm, which is completely different from those of sensitivity analysis methods developed so far, By combining massively parallel computation and interactive data visualization, MASSIVE enables us to inspect a broad parameter space intuitively. We demonstrated the utility of MASSIVE by its application to cancer evolution simulation, which successfully identified conditions that generate heterogeneous tumors. We believe that our approach would be a de facto standard for sensitivity analysis of agent-based simulation in an era of evergrowing computational technology. All the results form our MASSIVE analysis are available at https://www.hgc.jp/~niiyan/massive."

In this study, we analysed the immunomodulatory effects on innate immune cells of hydroalcoholic extract from Origanum vulgare L. ssp. hirtum (HyE-Ov), a plant traditionally known for its anti-oxidative properties. The effects of HyE-Ov were tested on human monocyte derived dendritic cells (DC), type-1 (M1) and type-2 macrophages (M2) infected with M. bovis Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG), used as a model of persistent intracellular bacterium. DC, M1 and M2 treated with HyE-Ov significantly enhanced their mycobactericidal activity, which was associated with phagosomal acidification in M1 and M2 and increase of phagosomal, but not mitochondrial ROS production in M1, M2, and DC. Treatment of BCG-infected DC with HyE-Ov significantly reduced TNF-α and IL-12 production and increased TGF-β synthesis. Finally, experiments were repeated using eight different HPLC fractions of HyE-Ov. Results showed that the capability to activate anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory response is shared by different fractions, suggesting that diverse bioactive molecules are present within the hydroalcoholic extract. Altogether, these results show that HyE-Ov promotes anti-mycobacterial innate immunity and limits inflammatory response in vitro and suggest that this plant extract may be exploitable as phytocomplex or nutraceutical for novel host-directed therapeutic approaches."
https://openalex.org/W2919123555,"Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a zoonotic disease, that causes significant morbidity and mortality among ungulate livestock and humans in endemic regions. In East Africa, the causative agent of the disease is Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) which is primarily transmitted by multiple mosquito species in Aedes and Mansonia genera during both epizootic and enzootic periods in a complex transmission cycle largely driven by environmental and climatic factors. However, recent RVFV activity in Uganda demonstrated the capability of the virus to spread into new regions through livestock movements, and underscored the need to develop effective mitigation strategies to reduce transmission and prevent spread among cattle populations. We simulated RVFV transmission among cows in 22 different locations of the Kabale District in Uganda using real world livestock data in a network-based model. This model considered livestock as a spatially explicit factor in different locations subjected to specific vector and environmental factors, and was configured to investigate and quantitatively evaluate the relative impacts of mosquito control, livestock movement, and diversity in cattle populations on the spread of the RVF epizootic. We concluded that cattle movement should be restricted for periods of high mosquito abundance to control epizootic spreading among locations during an RVF outbreak. Importantly, simulation results also showed that cattle populations with heterogeneous genetic diversity as crossbreeds were less susceptible to infection compared to homogenous cattle populations."

We examined temporal trends in injection drug use initiation and mortality among people who inject drugs (PWID) in Baltimore, Maryland.Data were derived from the baseline assessment of PWID enrolled in a community-based cohort study with longitudinal follow-up for mortality assessment. PWID were recruited from 2005-2008 (N = 1,008) and 2015-2018 (N = 737). We compared characteristics by birth cohort (before/after 1980) and type of drug initiated (prescription opioids, prescription non-opioids, non-injection illicit drugs, or injection drugs). We calculated standardized mortality ratios (SMR) using the US general population as the reference.PWID born after 1980 were more likely to initiate drug use with prescription opioids and non-opioids and had higher levels of polysubstance prior to injection initiation, compared to individuals born before 1980. Overall mortality was high: 2.59 per 100 person-years (95% CI: 2.27-2.95 per 100 person-years). Compared to the US population, the highest SMRs were observed among participants between 40-44 years of age, with especially high mortality among women in this age group (SMR:29.89, 95% CI: 15.24-44.54).Mirroring national trends, the profile of PWID in Baltimore has changed with increased prescription drug abuse and high levels of polysubstance use among younger PWID. Interventions need to reach those using prescription drugs early after initiation of use in order to reduce transition to injecting. Urgent attention is warranted to address premature mortality, particularly among middle-aged and female PWID."
https://openalex.org/W2953080307,"Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) targeting the BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, encoded by the Philadelphia chromosome, have drastically improved the outcomes for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Although several real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) kits for the detection of BCR-ABL1 transcripts are commercially available, their accuracy and efficiency in laboratory practice require reevaluation. We have developed a new in-house RQ-PCR method to detect minimal residual disease (MRD) in CML cases. MRD was analyzed in 102 patients with CML from the DOMEST study, a clinical trial to study the rationale for imatinib mesylate discontinuation in Japan. The BCR-ABL1/ABL1 ratio was evaluated using the international standard (IS) ratio, where IS < 0.1% was defined as a major molecular response. At enrollment, BCR-ABL1 transcripts were undetectable in all samples using a widely-applied RQ-PCR method performed in the commercial laboratory, BML (BML Inc., Tokyo, Japan); however, the in-house method detected the BCR-ABL1 transcripts in five samples (5%) (mean IS ratio: 0.0062 ± 0.0010%). After discontinuation of imatinib, BCR-ABL1 transcripts were detected using the in-house RQ-PCR in 21 patients (21%) that were not positive using the BML method. Nineteen samples were also tested using a commercially available RQ-PCR assay kit with a detection limit of IS ratio, 0.0032 (ODK-1201, Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Tokyo, Japan). This method detected low levels of BCR-ABL1 transcripts in 14 samples (74%), but scored negative for five samples (26%) that were positive using the in-house method. From the perspective of the in-house RQ-PCR method, number of patients confirmed loss of MMR was 4. These data suggest that our new in-house RQ-PCR method is effective for monitoring MRD in CML."
https://openalex.org/W2919035880,"Background There have been many efforts to find modifiable risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE) in the perioperative period of total knee arthroplasty (TKA), while no study has investigated the relationship between the muscle mass and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism frequency following TKA. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between muscle volume and the prevalence of symptomatic and radiologically confirmed venous thromboembolism (VTE) after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Methods A total of 261 consecutive patients who underwent primary TKA between 2013 and 2015 were enrolled. Computed tomographic venography with pulmonary angiography (CTVPA) was performed between the 5th and 7th postoperative days to assess the presence of VTE. Four parameters of muscle volume at three levels were evaluated on CTVPA: (i) the cross-sectional area of all skeletal muscles (skeletal muscle index) and total psoas area at the level of the third lumbar vertebrae; (ii) the vastus lateralis muscle at the thigh level; and (iii) the posterior crural muscle at the lower leg level. The relationship between the muscle volume at each level and the prevalence of VTE after TKA was evaluated with multivariate adjusted logistic regression models. Results The CTVPA scan showed no proximal DVT, and all thrombi were located in muscular, peroneal, and posterior tibial veins. In unilateral TKA, patients with lower muscle volume of the vastus lateralis at the thigh level in the nonoperated limb had significantly higher prevalence of distal DVT in the operated limb (adjusted OR: 2.97 at subclinical DVT revealed by CTVPA and adjusted OR: 2.68 at symptomatic DVT). This finding was also discovered in patients who underwent simultaneous bilateral TKA (adjusted OR: 1.73–2.97 at subclinical DVT and adjusted OR:1.76–1.86 at symptomatic DVT). Conclusions The relative muscle volume of the vastus lateralis at the thigh level was negatively associated with the prevalence of symptomatic and radiologically confirmed DVT, suggesting that low thigh muscle mass is an independent risk factor for VTE in the postoperative period of TKA."

This study examined whether geographic accessibility to primary care assessed by a sophisticated form of spatial measure is associated with a risk of hypertension and its treatment status among Japanese people in rural areas, where primary care is not yet established as specialization. We used an enhanced two-step floating catchment area method to calculate the neighborhood residential unit-level primary and secondary care accessibility for 52,029 subjects who participated in the 2015 annual health checkup held at 15 cities in Shimane Prefecture. Their hypertension level and treatment status were examined cross-sectionally with their neighborhood primary care and secondary care accessibility (computed with two separate distance-decay weight: slow and quick) by multivariable logistic regression controlling for demographics and neighborhood income level. The findings showed that greater geographic accessibility to primary care was associated with a decreased risk of hypertension in both slow and quick distance-decay weight, odds ratio (OR) = 0.989 (95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 0.984, 0.994), OR = 0.989 (95%CI = 0.984, 0.993), respectively. On the other hand, better secondary care accessibility was associated with an increased risk of hypertension and untreated hypertension; however, the effect of secondary care was mitigated by the effect of primary care accessibility in both slow and quick distance-decay model, hypertension: OR = 0.974 (95% CI = 0.957, 0.991), OR = 0.981 (95%CI = 0.970, 0.991), untreated hypertension: OR = 0.970 (95%CI = 0.944, 0.996), OR = 0.975 (95%CI = 0.959, 0.991), respectively. In addition, the results revealed that young and fit people were at a higher risk of untreated hypertension, which is a unique finding in the context of the Japanese healthcare system. Our findings indicate the importance of primary care even in Japan, where it is not yet established, and also emphasize the need for a culturally specific perspective in health equity."
https://openalex.org/W2899679875,"Recent studies have provided evidence for a role of duration-tuned channels in the encoding of duration. Duration encoding in these channels is thought to reflect the time between responses to the onset and offset of an event. This notion is in apparent conflict with studies that demonstrate that the perceived duration of an event can vary independently from the time separating its perceived onset and offset. Instead, these studies suggest that duration encoding is sensitive to other temporal aspects of a sensory event. In the current study, we investigated whether duration-tuned channels encode duration based on the time between the on- and offset of an event (onset-offset duration), or if they encode a duration corresponding to the perceived duration of that event. We used a duration illusion to dissociate onset-offset duration and perceived duration and measured whether repeated exposure to illusion-inducing stimuli caused adaptation to the onset-offset duration or the perceived duration of these illusion-inducing stimuli. We report clear evidence for adaptation to the onset-offset duration of illusion-inducing stimuli. This finding supports the notion that duration-tuned mechanisms respond to the time between the onset and offset of an event, without necessarily reflecting the duration perceived, and eventually reported by the participant. Implications for the duration channel model and the mechanisms underlying duration illusions are discussed."

The molecular epidemiology of those infections has not been studied before.Consensus Sanger sequences of HVR1 and NS5B from 125 cases of HIV/HCV coinfections, collected during 2010-2014 in 15 different Bulgarian cities, were used for preliminary phylogenetic evaluation. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) data of the hypervariable region 1 (HVR1) analyzed via the Global Hepatitis Outbreak and Surveillance Technology (GHOST) were used to evaluate genetic heterogeneity and possible transmission linkages. Links between pairs that were below and above the established genetic distance threshold, indicative of transmission, were further examined by generating k-step networks.Preliminary genetic analyses showed predominance of HCV genotype 1a (54%), followed by 1b (20.8%), 2a (1.4%), 3a (22.3%) and 4a (1.4%), indicating ongoing transmission of many HCV strains of different genotypes. NGS of HVR1 from 72 cases showed significant genetic heterogeneity of intra-host HCV populations, with 5 cases being infected with 2 different genotypes or subtypes and 6 cases being infected with 2 strains of same subtype. GHOST revealed 8 transmission clusters involving 30 cases (41.7%), indicating a high rate of transmission. Four transmission clusters were found in Sofia, three in Plovdiv, and one in Peshtera. The main risk factor for the clusters was injection drug use. Close genetic proximity among HCV strains from the 3 Sofia clusters, and between HCV strains from Peshtera and one of the two Plovdiv clusters confirms a long and extensive transmission history of these strains in Bulgaria.Identification of several HCV genotypes and many HCV strains suggests a frequent introduction of HCV to the studied high-risk communities. GHOST detected a broad transmission network, which sustains circulation of several HCV strains since their early introduction in the 3 cities. This is the first report on the molecular epidemiology of HIV/HCV coinfections in Bulgaria."

Therefore, IgE is a major target for managing allergies. Previous studies have reported that oligomannose on IgE can be a potential target to inhibit allergic responses. However, enzymes that can modulate IgE activity are not yet known. Here, we found that the commercial receptor-destroying enzyme (RDE) (II) from Vibrio cholerae culture fluid specifically modulates IgE, but not IgG, and prevents the initiation of anaphylaxis. RDE (II)–treated IgE cannot access its binding site on bone marrow–derived mast cells, resulting in reduced release of histamine and cytokines. We also noted that RDE (II)–treated IgE could not induce passive cutaneous anaphylaxis in mouse ears. Taken together, we concluded that RDE (II) modulates the IgE structure and renders it unable to mediate allergic responses. To reveal the mechanism by which RDE (II) interferes with IgE activity, we performed lectin microarray analysis to unravel the relationship between IgE modulation and glycosylation. We observed that RDE (II) treatment significantly reduced the binding of IgE to Lycopersicon esculentum lectin, which recognizes poly-N-acetylglucosamine and poly-N-acetyllactosamine.

IgE was discovered about 50 years ago by Ishizaka and Ishizaka (1Ishizaka K. Ishizaka T. Identification of γ-E-antibodies as a carrier of reaginic activity.J.

The study found that intracutaneous injection with only 1–2 ng/ml IgE could induce an erythema-wheal reaction in healthy subjects (2Ishizaka K. Ishizaka T. Identification of IgE.J. Allergy Clin.

By subsequent exposure to the allergen, IgE-binding mast cells released proinflammatory mediators, including histamine and cytokines, which cause an allergic response (5Yamaguchi M. Lantz C.S.

Taken together, IgE is considered one of the major targets for therapy against allergies. Omalizumab, which binds to the Fc region of IgE and inhibits binding to FcεRI, has been previously found to be a successful therapy against certain allergies (3Balbino B. Conde E. Marichal T.

They indicated that Flavobacterium meningosepticum peptide:N-glycosidase F (PNGase F), which removes almost all N-linked oligosaccharides, reduces the binding level of IgE to FcεRI in ELISA. Moreover, Shade et al. (10Shade K.-T. Platzer B. Washburn N. Mani V. Bartsch Y.C. Conroy M. Pagan J.D. Bosques C. Mempel T.R. Fiebiger E. Anthony R.M.

Modifications at these sites by endoglycosidase F1 (Endo F1), which cleaves within the chitobiose core of high-mannose and some hybrid oligosaccharides from N-linked glycoproteins, abrogate IgE binding to FcεRI. Therefore, the modification of oligomannose prevents the initiation of anaphylaxis by mast cells. In their study, they suggested that IgE oligomannose may be a potential therapeutic target. Wu et al. (11Wu G. Hitchen P.G. Panico M. North S.J. Barbouche M.R. Binet D. Morris H.R. Dell A. Haslam S.M. Glycoproteomic studies of IgE from a novel hyper-IgE syndrome linked to PGM3 mutation.Glycoconj.

However, PNGase F and Endo F1 cannot specifically modulate IgE because most sugar proteins have N-linked oligosaccharides. To target the glycan on IgE specifically for the therapy, more research is required to identify a specific enzyme that is able to modulate the glycan structure in IgE. Previously, we coincidentally found that commercial receptor-destroying enzyme (RDE) (II) from Vibrio cholerae culture fluid (13Tyrrell D.A. Horsfall Jr., F.L. A procedure which eliminates nonspecific inhibitor from human serum but does not affect specific antibodies against influenza viruses.J. Immunol. 1952; 69 (13011314): 563-574PubMed Google Scholar) reduced the binding level of IgE to influenza virus antigen, hemagglutinin (HA) (Fig. 1A) (14Yamazaki T. Nagashima M. Ninomiya D. Ainai A.

Immunol. 2018; 9 (29416543): 4710.3389/fimmu.2018.00047Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). RDE (II) contains a neuraminidase (NA) (sialidase) and is usually used for preventing nonspecific binding of influenza HA to sialic acid in neutralizing assays. We genetically switched the constant region of anti-HA IgG to anti-HA IgA, IgM, IgD, and IgE and established all classes of anti-HA–coding plasmids. All variable regions were the same, and the binding affinity to influenza HA was considered as equal. However, RDE (II)–treated IgE could not neutralize virus infection despite there being sufficient activity of RDE (II)–treated IgG, IgA, and IgM (14Yamazaki T. Nagashima M. Ninomiya D. Ainai A.

In this study, we showed that RDE (II) altered the structure of IgE and abrogated IgE binding to FcεRI on mast cells, which is directly related to the mast cell degranulation, thereby preventing anaphylaxis. Furthermore, we identified that RDE (II)–treated IgE had reduced capacity of binding to Lycopersicon esculentum (LEL), which recognizes poly N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and poly-N-acetyllactosamine (LacNAc) (15Immel F.

Taken together, RDE (II) was found to have the specific characteristics necessary to modulate the glycan on IgE, when compared with IgG. We previously generated the plasmid vector coding the antibody gene of anti-HA IgG and anti-HA IgE (14Yamazaki T. Nagashima M. Ninomiya D. Ainai A. Fujimoto A. Ichimonji I. Takagi H. Morita N. Murotani K. Hasegawa H. Chiba J. Akashi-Takamura S. Neutralizing antibodies induced by gene-based hydrodynamic injection have a therapeutic effect in lethal influenza infection.Front.

Surprisingly, even the variable regions were conserved, wherein anti-HA IgE was not able to neutralize the influenza virus in vitro (14Yamazaki T. Nagashima M. Ninomiya D. Ainai A. Fujimoto A. Ichimonji I. Takagi H. Morita N. Murotani K. Hasegawa H. Chiba J. Akashi-Takamura S.

Immunol. 2018; 9 (29416543): 4710.3389/fimmu.2018.00047Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). For the neutralizing assay, the specimens were treated with RDE (II) (13Tyrrell D.A. Horsfall Jr., F.L. A procedure which eliminates nonspecific inhibitor from human serum but does not affect specific antibodies against influenza viruses.J. Immunol. 1952; 69 (13011314): 563-574PubMed Google Scholar), followed by incubation with influenza virus in the presence of trypsin, which cleaves the HA of the influenza virus (21Klenk H.D. Rott R. Orlich M. Blödorn J. Activation of influenza A viruses by trypsin treatment.Virology. 1975; 68 (173078): 426-43910.1016/0042-6822(75)90284-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). We also reconfirmed that the antigen-binding activity of anti-HA IgE treated with RDE (II) was reduced to the background level, although anti-HA IgG was almost not affected (Fig. 1A) (14Yamazaki T. Nagashima M. Ninomiya D. Ainai A. Fujimoto A. Ichimonji I. Takagi H. Morita N. Murotani K. Hasegawa H. Chiba J. Akashi-Takamura S. Neutralizing antibodies induced by gene-based hydrodynamic injection have a therapeutic effect in lethal influenza infection.Front. Immunol. 2018; 9 (29416543): 4710.3389/fimmu.2018.00047Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Moreover, we were almost unable to detect RDE (II)–treated IgE by antibodies against ε chain, despite RDE (II)–treated anti-HA IgG being detected at almost the same level as the untreated antibody (Fig. 1B). In our previous report (14Yamazaki T. Nagashima M. Ninomiya D. Ainai A. Fujimoto A. Ichimonji I. Takagi H. Morita N. Murotani K. Hasegawa H. Chiba J. Akashi-Takamura S. Neutralizing antibodies induced by gene-based hydrodynamic injection have a therapeutic effect in lethal influenza infection.Front. Immunol. 2018; 9 (29416543): 4710.3389/fimmu.2018.00047Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), we could not detect RDE (II)–treated anti-HA IgE using antibodies against ε chain by Western blotting. However, the light chain of anti-HA IgG and anti-HA IgE was expressed from the same plasmid vector. Therefore, we measured the binding activity of light chain-binding protein (BP) (Fig. 1C). We detected bands of untreated and RDE (II)–treated IgE at over 250 kDa, which was much larger than predicted (around 200 kDa) (Fig. 1C) (3Balbino B. Conde E. Marichal T. Starkl P. Reber L.L. Approaches to target IgE antibodies in allergic diseases.Pharmacol. Ther. 2018; 191 (29909239): 50-6410.1016/j.pharmthera.2018.05.015Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that RDE (II) affects not only the antigen-binding region of anti-HA IgE but also the constant region, except for the light chain. Because anti-HA IgG was not affected by RDE (II), it is also suggested that the reactivity of RDE (II) is specific for anti-HA IgE. To confirm whether RDE (II) affected the IgE antibody, purified mouse monoclonal IgE (anti-TNP IgE) and IgG (anti-T-2 mycotoxin IgG) were treated with RDE (II) and detected by Western blotting. Although RDE (II)–treated IgG was detected as several smaller bands, a single band over 150 kDa, which was the intact size of IgG antibodies (Fig. 2A, lanes 5–8), was detected and identified as the untreated IgG (Fig. 2A, lanes 1–4). In contrast, in the absence of RDE (II), the band of the purified IgE was mainly detected as over 250 kDa, as seen in Fig. 1C (Fig. 2A, lanes 9–12). We also detected a much smaller-sized band of RDE (II)–treated IgE, around 150 kDa (Fig. 2A, lanes 13–16). Moreover, we obtained the same results by CBB staining (Fig. 2B) and light chain BP (Fig. 2C). To analyze which heavy chain (ε chain) or light chain RDE (II) has a greater effect, we analyzed RDE (II)–treated IgE under reducing conditions. Using antibodies against the ε chain, we obtained a smaller band (around 50 kDa) than that of the untreated (over 75 kDa), depending on the serial dilution (Fig. 2D). Using light chain BP, the band size obtained was the same even after treating with RDE (II) (Fig. 2E). These results indicate that RDE (II) affects the ε chain and not the light chain, which is similar to that demonstrated in Fig. 1C. To confirm the influence of RDE (II) on the constant region, we quantified the binding activity of the antibodies against the constant region in the presence and absence of RDE (II). In the plate coated with anti-mouse immunoglobulins (Igs), RDE (II)–treated IgE levels decreased depending on the concentration of RDE (II) (Fig. 2F), although RDE (II)–treated IgG was stably detected at almost the same level as that of the untreated (Fig. 2G). Moreover, a 34-fold dilution was the titer of RDE (II) for IgE in the reduction of binding levels to coated anti-mouse Igs (Fig. 2F) and that of the band from over 75 to 50 kDa (Fig. 2, D and F). Taken together, these results suggest that the reduction of the size by RDE (II) correlates with the binding activity to antibodies against ε chain. Next, we confirmed whether RDE (II) could reduce the binding activity of serum IgE to anti-ε chain ex vivo. We previously succeeded in inducing the expression of anti-HA IgE in the mouse serum by hydrodynamic injection with the plasmid vector encoding the antibody gene (14Yamazaki T. Nagashima M. Ninomiya D. Ainai A. Fujimoto A. Ichimonji I. Takagi H. Morita N. Murotani K. Hasegawa H. Chiba J. Akashi-Takamura S. Neutralizing antibodies induced by gene-based hydrodynamic injection have a therapeutic effect in lethal influenza infection.Front. Immunol. 2018; 9 (29416543): 4710.3389/fimmu.2018.00047Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). We obtained serum from mice in which anti-HA IgE and anti-HA IgG antibody coding gene had been transferred, followed by incubation with RDE (II). The expression level of RDE (II)–treated anti-HA IgE was not detected in the serum at all, although 2400 ng/ml (= 103.4) of the untreated specimen was detected (Fig. 3A). On the contrary, RDE (II)–treated anti-HA IgG in serum was detected at the same level as that in the absence of RDE (II) (Fig. 3B). We also confirmed that the entire level of IgE in the mouse serum was reduced by treatment with RDE (II) (Fig. 3C). In contrast, the entire IgG level was the same as the level both of RDE (II)–treated and -untreated specimens (Fig. 3D). These results indicate that RDE (II) specifically reduces the binding of IgE to anti-ε antibodies but does not affect the level of IgG in serum. Therefore, this suggests that RDE (II) influences the construction of the ε chain and not the γ chain. RDE (II) treatment affects the construction of IgE. Therefore, we investigated whether RDE (II) alters IgE-mediated mast cell activation. To evaluate the stimulation and release of cytokines and histamines from BMMCs with RDE (II)–treated IgE, BMMCs were incubated with RDE (II)–treated anti-dinitrophenol (DNP) IgE (22Liu F.T. Bohn J.W. Ferry E.L. Yamamoto H. Molinaro C.A. Sherman L.A. Klinman N.R. Katz D.H. Monoclonal dinitrophenyl-specific murine IgE antibody: preparation, isolation, and characterization.J. Immunol. 1980; 124 (7373045): 2728-2737Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, BMMCs were activated by cross-linking IgE with DNP–human serum albumin (HSA). The supernatants were obtained, and the induction levels of TNFα, IL-6, and histamine were measured, which are the classical activation markers of mast cells. Although untreated IgE-sensitized BMMCs released large amounts of TNFα, IL-6, and histamine, all of the levels were significantly reduced in RDE (II)–treated IgE-sensitized BMMCs (Fig. 4, A–C). To confirm the binding of RDE (II)–treated IgE to BMMCs, we sensitized the cells with untreated or RDE (II)–treated anti-DNP IgE. As shown in Fig. 4D, although untreated IgE could bind to BMMCs, RDE (II)–treated IgE could barely bind to BMMCs (Fig. 4D). However, the binding level of control IgG to bone marrow–derived macrophages (BMMs) was barely affected by RDE (II). We also confirmed that RDE (II) was not toxic for BMMCs, because propidium iodide–positive cells were barely detected in BMMCs with RDE (II)–treated IgE (Fig. S1). These data indicate that RDE (II)–treated IgE can no longer bind to BMMCs. Therefore, BMMCs are unable to release cytokines and histamine even in presence of the antigen. To evaluate whether RDE (II)–treated anti-DNP IgE has a similar effect in vivo, we examined IgE-mediated passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) in mouse models. Increased vascular permeability was observed in mice that were injected with untreated anti-DNP IgE (Fig. 4, E and F). On the contrary, vascular permeability was significantly decreased in mice with RDE (II)–treated anti-DNP IgE, as in the control (Fig. 4, E and F). These results correlated with those observed in the experimental data of BMMC. RDE (II) significantly affects the structure and activity of IgE. Therefore, this suggests that the neutralizing titer of anti-HA IgE against influenza virus was reduced in vitro, compared with that of anti-HA IgG in our previous report (14Yamazaki T. Nagashima M. Ninomiya D. Ainai A. Fujimoto A. Ichimonji I. Takagi H. Morita N. Murotani K. Hasegawa H. Chiba J. Akashi-Takamura S. Neutralizing antibodies induced by gene-based hydrodynamic injection have a therapeutic effect in lethal influenza infection.Front. Immunol. 2018; 9 (29416543): 4710.3389/fimmu.2018.00047Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). To cleave the HA of influenza virus to enable the virus to infect host cells, we incubated the cells in the presence of trypsin (21Klenk H.D. Rott R. Orlich M. Blödorn J. Activation of influenza A viruses by trypsin treatment.Virology. 1975; 68 (173078): 426-43910.1016/0042-6822(75)90284-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). We also confirmed the binding activity of the anti-ε chain to the trypsin-treated IgE. Although trypsin-treated IgG was detected at almost the same level as intact IgG (Fig. S2B), trypsin-treated IgE was significantly reduced by 2-fold (Fig. S2A). To evaluate whether trypsin affected the structure of IgE, we separated trypsin-treated IgE by Western blotting under nonreducing conditions. Interestingly, the main band of the IgE was reduced to around 150 kDa, as seen previously in RDE (II)–treated IgE (Fig. S2C, lanes 10–12). On the contrary, trypsin-treated IgG was detected at the same size as untreated IgG (Fig. S2C, lanes 4–6). Under reducing conditions, we also obtained a smaller band, around 50 kDa, than that of untreated IgE, depending on the serial dilution (Fig. S2D). These results suggest that trypsin also specifically affects the structure of IgE as RDE (II). Both RDE (II) and trypsin significantly reduced the binding activity of IgE against anti-ε chain antibodies and affected the structure. It was considered that RDE (II) has protease activity like trypsin. To confirm our hypothesis, we used preincubated RDE (II) at 56 or 100 °C (56 °C-RDE (II) or 100 °C-RDE (II)), followed by treatment of IgE and IgG. 56 °C-RDE (II)–treated IgE indicated the same binding activity to anti-ε chain as intact RDE (II), which was reduced by 2-fold compared with the control (Fig. 5A). However, 100 °C-RDE (II)–treated IgE was not detected in the reduction of the binding activity to the anti-ε chain at the same level as the control (Fig. 5A). We also found that a band of ∼150 kDa was not detected in 100 °C-RDE (II)–treated IgE, and only a band over 250 kDa was detected (Fig. 5B). These results suggest that the activity of RDE (II) is caused by a function of an enzyme such as protease or glycosidase. To remove the possibility of low molecular weight compound-induced function, we dialyzed RDE (II) to exclude any molecule below 12–16 kDa. We confirmed that the band of IgE treated with dialyzed RDE (II) was also around 150 kDa, the same as that treated with intact RDE (II) (Fig. 5C). These results suggest that RDE (II) works as an enzyme for the modulation of IgE. Then, we analyzed the time course of the reduction by treatment with RDE (II). After incubation for 10 min, ladder bands between >250 and ∼150 kDa were detected (Fig. 5D, lane 2). The band over 250 kDa reduced and that around 150 kDa increased over time (Fig. 5D, lanes 3 and 4)"
https://openalex.org/W2918788562,"We examine the relationship between school attendance and HIV incidence among young women in South Africa. Our aim is to distinguish a causal effect from correlation. Towards this end, we apply three methods to population-based longitudinal data for 2005–2012 in KwaZulu-Natal. After establishing a negative association, we first use a method that assesses the influence of omitted variables. We then estimate models with exclusion restrictions to remove endogeneity bias, and finally we estimate models that control for unobserved factors that remain constant over time. All the three methods have strengths and weaknesses, but none of them suggests a causal effect. Thus, interventions that increase school attendance in KwaZulu-Natal would probably not mechanically reduce HIV risk for young women. Although the impact of school attendance could vary depending on context, unobserved variables are likely to be an important reason for the common finding of a negative association between school attendance and HIV incidence in the literature."

Since experimental designs such as Randomized Controlled Trials are generally not feasible for spatial problems, researchers need to rely on quasi-experimental approaches using observational data. We provide a regression-based framework of the key procedures for GIS-based empirical research design using georeferenced point data for both spatial events of interest and subjects exposed to the events. We illustrate its utility and implementation through a case study on the impacts of the Cambodian genocide under the Pol Pot regime on post-conflict education."

Few studies have explored adverse outcomes and medical care costs concurrently (as a proxy for care intensity) among patients with BD admitted for stroke. Data for this nationwide population-based study were extracted from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database, on 580 patients with BD hospitalized for stroke (the study group) and a comparison group consisting of randomly selected 1740 stroke patients without BD matched by propensity scores. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) for adverse in-hospital outcomes between study group and comparison group. We found that stroke patients with BD had significantly lower in-hospital mortality (3.28% vs. 5.63%), acute respiratory failure (2.59% vs. 5.57%), and use of mechanical ventilation (6.55% vs. 10.23%) than the comparison group. After adjusting for geographical location, urbanization level, monthly income, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and coronary heart disease, the odds of in-hospital mortality, acute respiratory failure, and use of mechanical ventilation in the BD group were 0.56 (95% CI: 0.34–0.92), 0.46 (95% CI: 0.26–0.80), and 0.63 (95% CI: 0.44–0.91), respectively. No differences were found in hospitalization costs and the length of hospital stay. With comparable hospitalization costs and length of hospital stay, we concluded that stroke patients with BD had lower in-hospital mortality and serious adverse events compared to stroke patients without BD."
https://openalex.org/W2920292121,"Certain attributes of the hog industry increase the production risk in nodal enterprises of the hog supply chain, leading to high financing costs and eventually resulting in liquidity constraints. When the hog supply chain node enterprises are subjected to external shocks, on the basis of the commercial credit relationship in the supply chain, the entire supply chain generates liquidity risks and systemic risks. We analyze the input and output of the hog supply chain node enterprises under the constraint of liquidity, construct the mathematical model, discuss the dynamic differences of liquidity constraints in different situations, and measures the commercial credit risk and anti-risk ability of the pig supply chain node enterprises. If the external shock is less than a certain value, the current profits of the hog enterprise can entirely make up for the loss caused by external shocks, and the production of the firm will return to its state of equilibrium. If the external shock is large enough, liquidity constraints will seriously restrict the production input of the enterprise, which then leads to a deceleration of production input and may ultimately result in bankruptcy. We believe that the structure of the hog industry supply chain should be constantly adjusted to optimize the industrial upgrading and organizational form of the hog supply chain."
https://openalex.org/W2920792029,"Accumulation of mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is thought to be responsible for mitochondrial, and other, diseases and biological phenomena, such as diabetes, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and aging. Mouse models may elucidate the relationship between mutations in mtDNA and these abnormalities. However, because of the difficulty of mtDNA manipulation, generation of mouse models has not sufficiently progressed to enable such studies. To overcome this difficulty and to establish a source of diverse mtDNA mutations, we here generated cultured mouse cells containing mtDNA derived from an mtDNA mutator mouse that accumulates random mtDNA mutations with age. Mutation analysis of the obtained transmitochondrial cytoplasmic hybrid cells (cybrids) revealed that the cells harbored diverse mtDNA mutations occurring at a higher frequency than in mouse tissues, and exhibited severe respiration defects that would be lethal in tissues or organs. Abnormal respiratory complex formation and high stress on the mitochondrial protein quality control system appeared to be involved in these severe respiration defects. The mutation rates of the majority of highly accumulated mutations converged to either approximately 5%, 10%, or 40%, suggesting that these mutations are linked on the respective mtDNA molecules, and mtDNA in cybrid cells likely consisted of mtDNA molecules clonally expanded from the small population of introduced mtDNAs. Thus, the linked mutations in these cybrid cells cannot be evaluated individually. In addition, mtDNA mutations homologous to confirmed pathogenic mutations in human were rarely observed in our generated cybrids. However, the transmitochondrial cybrids constitute a useful tool for concentrating pathogenic mtDNA mutations and as a source of diverse mtDNA mutations to elucidate the relationship between mtDNA mutations and diseases."
