https://openalex.org/W4283803434,"In July 2012, the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations at the CERN Large Hadron Collider announced the observation of a Higgs boson at a mass of around 125 GeV. Ten years later, and with the data corresponding to the production of 30 times larger number of Higgs bosons, we have learnt much more about the properties of the Higgs boson. The CMS experiment has observed the Higgs boson in numerous fermionic and bosonic decay channels, established its spin-parity quantum numbers, determined its mass and measured its production cross sections in various modes. Here the CMS Collaboration reports the most up-to-date combination of results on the properties of the Higgs boson, including the most stringent limit on the cross section for the production of a pair of Higgs bosons, on the basis of data from proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. Within the uncertainties, all these observations are compatible with the predictions of the standard model of elementary particle physics. Much evidence points to the fact that the standard model is a low-energy approximation of a more comprehensive theory. Several of the standard model issues originate in the sector of Higgs boson physics. An order of magnitude larger number of Higgs bosons, expected to be examined over the next fifteen years, will help deepen our understanding of this crucial sector."
https://openalex.org/W4283796538,"The standard model of particle physics1-4 describes the known fundamental particles and forces that make up our Universe, with the exception of gravity. One of the central features of the standard model is a field that permeates all of space and interacts with fundamental particles5-9. The quantum excitation of this field, known as the Higgs field, manifests itself as the Higgs boson, the only fundamental particle with no spin. In 2012, a particle with properties consistent with the Higgs boson of the standard model was observed by the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN10,11. Since then, more than 30 times as many Higgs bosons have been recorded by the ATLAS experiment, enabling much more precise measurements and new tests of the theory. Here, on the basis of this larger dataset, we combine an unprecedented number of production and decay processes of the Higgs boson to scrutinize its interactions with elementary particles. Interactions with gluons, photons, and W and Z bosons-the carriers of the strong, electromagnetic and weak forces-are studied in detail. Interactions with three third-generation matter particles (bottom (b) and top (t) quarks, and tau leptons (τ)) are well measured and indications of interactions with a second-generation particle (muons, μ) are emerging. These tests reveal that the Higgs boson discovered ten years ago is remarkably consistent with the predictions of the theory and provide stringent constraints on many models of new phenomena beyond the standard model."
https://openalex.org/W4283821860,"Abstract Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) increases rapidly in prevalence beyond age 60 and has been associated with increased risk for malignancy, heart disease and ischemic stroke. CHIP is driven by somatic mutations in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Because mutations in HSPCs often drive leukemia, we hypothesized that HSPC fitness substantially contributes to transformation from CHIP to leukemia. HSPC fitness is defined as the proliferative advantage over cells carrying no or only neutral mutations. If mutations in different genes lead to distinct fitness advantages, this could enable patient stratification. We quantified the fitness effects of mutations over 12 years in older age using longitudinal sequencing and developed a filtering method that considers individual mutational context alongside mutation co-occurrence to quantify the growth potential of variants within individuals. We found that gene-specific fitness differences can outweigh inter-individual variation and, therefore, could form the basis for personalized clinical management."
https://openalex.org/W4283796721,"Plant biotechnology predominantly relies on a restricted set of genetic parts with limited capability to customize spatiotemporal and conditional expression patterns. Synthetic gene circuits have the potential to integrate multiple customizable input signals through a processing unit constructed from biological parts to produce a predictable and programmable output. Here we present a suite of functional recombinase-based gene circuits for use in plants. We first established a range of key gene circuit components compatible with plant cell functionality. We then used these to develop a range of operational logic gates using the identify function (activation) and negation function (repression) in Arabidopsis protoplasts and in vivo, demonstrating their utility for programmable manipulation of transcriptional activity in a complex multicellular organism. Specifically, using recombinases and plant control elements, we activated transgenes in YES, OR and AND gates and repressed them in NOT, NOR and NAND gates; we also implemented the A NIMPLY B gate that combines activation and repression. Through use of genetic recombination, these circuits create stable long-term changes in expression and recording of past stimuli. This highly compact programmable gene circuit platform provides new capabilities for engineering sophisticated transcriptional programs and previously unrealized traits into plants. Transcriptional activity in plants is controlled with a programmable gene circuit."
https://openalex.org/W4283799933,"The usefulness of live attenuated virus vaccines has been limited by suboptimal immunogenicity, safety concerns or cumbersome manufacturing processes and techniques. Here we describe the generation of a live attenuated influenza A virus vaccine using proteolysis-targeting chimeric (PROTAC) technology to degrade viral proteins via the endogenous ubiquitin–proteasome system of host cells. We engineered the genome of influenza A viruses in stable cell lines engineered for virus production to introduce a conditionally removable proteasome-targeting domain, generating fully infective PROTAC viruses that were live attenuated by the host protein degradation machinery upon infection. In mouse and ferret models, PROTAC viruses were highly attenuated and able to elicit robust and broad humoral, mucosal and cellular immunity against homologous and heterologous virus challenges. PROTAC-mediated attenuation of viruses may be broadly applicable for generating live attenuated vaccines. Influenza virus is attenuated for vaccine production using PROTAC degradation technology."
https://openalex.org/W4283802815,"Systematically identifying synergistic combinations of targeted agents and immunotherapies for cancer treatments remains difficult. In this study, we integrated high-throughput and high-content techniques-an implantable microdevice to administer multiple drugs into different sites in tumors at nanodoses and multiplexed imaging of tumor microenvironmental states-to investigate the tumor cell and immunological response signatures to different treatment regimens. Using a mouse model of breast cancer, we identified effective combinations from among numerous agents within days. In vivo studies in three immunocompetent mammary carcinoma models demonstrated that the predicted combinations synergistically increased therapeutic efficacy. We identified at least five promising treatment strategies, of which the panobinostat, venetoclax and anti-CD40 triple therapy was the most effective in inducing complete tumor remission across models. Successful drug combinations increased spatial association of cancer stem cells with dendritic cells during immunogenic cell death, suggesting this as an important mechanism of action in long-term breast cancer control."
https://openalex.org/W4283797057,"The pancreas and liver arise from a common pool of progenitors. However, the underlying mechanisms that drive their lineage diversification from the foregut endoderm are not fully understood. To tackle this question, we undertook a multifactorial approach that integrated human pluripotent-stem-cell-guided differentiation, genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 screening, single-cell analysis, genomics and proteomics. We discovered that HHEX, a transcription factor (TF) widely recognized as a key regulator of liver development, acts as a gatekeeper of pancreatic lineage specification. HHEX deletion impaired pancreatic commitment and unleashed an unexpected degree of cellular plasticity towards the liver and duodenum fates. Mechanistically, HHEX cooperates with the pioneer TFs FOXA1, FOXA2 and GATA4, shared by both pancreas and liver differentiation programmes, to promote pancreas commitment, and this cooperation restrains the shared TFs from activating alternative lineages. These findings provide a generalizable model for how gatekeeper TFs like HHEX orchestrate lineage commitment and plasticity restriction in broad developmental contexts."
https://openalex.org/W4283820098,"Aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs) are promising cancer drug targets, as certain isoforms are required for the survival of stem-like tumor cells. We have discovered selective inhibitors of ALDH1B1, a mitochondrial enzyme that promotes colorectal and pancreatic cancer. We describe bicyclic imidazoliums and guanidines that target the ALDH1B1 active site with comparable molecular interactions and potencies. Both pharmacophores abrogate ALDH1B1 function in cells; however, the guanidines circumvent an off-target mitochondrial toxicity exhibited by the imidazoliums. Our lead isoform-selective guanidinyl antagonists of ALDHs exhibit proteome-wide target specificity, and they selectively block the growth of colon cancer spheroids and organoids. Finally, we have used genetic and chemical perturbations to elucidate the ALDH1B1-dependent transcriptome, which includes genes that regulate mitochondrial metabolism and ribosomal function. Our findings support an essential role for ALDH1B1 in colorectal cancer, provide molecular probes for studying ALDH1B1 functions and yield leads for developing ALDH1B1-targeting therapies. Aldehyde dehydrogenase 1B1-specific small-molecule inhibitors are identified that block the growth of colon cancer spheroids and organoids and are shown to potentially regulate mitochondrial metabolism and ribosomal function."

https://openalex.org/W4283740543,"Increased MAPK signaling is a hallmark of various cancers and is a central regulator of cell survival. Direct ERK1/2 inhibition is considered a promising approach to avoid ERK1/2 reactivation caused by upstream kinases BRAF, MEK1/2, and KRAS, as well as by receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors, but the dynamics and selectivity of ERK1/2 inhibitors are much less studied compared with BRAF or MEK inhibitors. Using ERK1/2 and downstream kinase ELK1 reporter cell lines of lung cancer (H1299; NRASQ61K), colon cancer (HCT-116; KRASG13D), neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y), and leukemia (U937), we examined the relationship between ERK inhibition and drug-induced toxicity for five ERK inhibitors: SCH772984, ravoxertinib, LY3214996, ulixertinib, and VX-11e, as well as one MEK inhibitor, PD0325901. Comparing cell viability and ERK inhibition revealed different ERK dependencies for these cell lines. We identify several drugs, such as SCH772984 and VX-11e, which induce excessive toxicity not directly related to ERK1/2 inhibition in specific cell lines. We also show that PD0325901, LY3214996, and ulixertinib are prone to ERK1/2 reactivation over time. We distinguished two types of ERK1/2 reactivation: the first could be reversed by adding a fresh dose of inhibitors, while the second persists even after additional treatments. We also showed that cells that became resistant to the MEK1/2 inhibitor PD0325901 due to ERK1/2 reactivation remained sensitive to ERK1/2 inhibitor ulixertinib. Our data indicate that correlation of ERK inhibition with drug-induced toxicity in multiple cell lines may help to find more selective and effective ERK1/2 inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W4283798338,"Mutagenic purine-pyrimidine repeats can adopt the left-handed Z-DNA conformation. DNA breaks at potential Z-DNA sites can lead to somatic mutations in cancer or to germline mutations that are transmitted to the next generation. It is not known whether any mechanism exists in the germ line to control Z-DNA structure and DNA breaks at purine-pyrimidine repeats. Here we provide genetic, epigenomic and biochemical evidence for the existence of a biological process that erases Z-DNA specifically in germ cells of the mouse male foetus. We show that a previously uncharacterized zinc finger protein, ZBTB43, binds to and removes Z-DNA, preventing the formation of DNA double-strand breaks. By removing Z-DNA, ZBTB43 also promotes de novo DNA methylation at CG-containing purine-pyrimidine repeats in prospermatogonia. Therefore, the genomic and epigenomic integrity of the species is safeguarded by remodelling DNA structure in the mammalian germ line during a critical window of germline epigenome reprogramming."
https://openalex.org/W4283750312,"Pah1 phosphatidate (PA) phosphatase plays a major role in triacylglycerol synthesis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by producing its precursor diacylglycerol and concurrently regulates de novo phospholipid synthesis by consuming its precursor PA. The function of Pah1 requires its membrane localization, which is controlled by its phosphorylation state. Pah1 is dephosphorylated by the Nem1-Spo7 protein phosphatase, whereas its phosphorylation occurs by multiple known and unknown protein kinases. In this work, we show that Rim11, a yeast homolog of mammalian glycogen synthase kinase-3β, is a protein kinase that phosphorylates Pah1 on serine (Ser12, Ser602, and Ser818) and threonine (Thr163, Thr164, Thr522) residues. Enzymological characterization of Rim11 showed that its Km for Pah1 (0.4 μM) is similar to those of other Pah1-phosphorylating protein kinases, but its Km for ATP (30 μM) is significantly higher than those of these same kinases. Furthermore, we demonstrate Rim11 phosphorylation of Pah1 does not require substrate prephosphorylation but was increased ∼2-fold upon its prephosphorylation by the Pho85-Pho80 protein kinase. In addition, we show Rim11-phosphorylated Pah1 was a substrate for dephosphorylation by Nem1-Spo7. Finally, we demonstrate the Rim11 phosphorylation of Pah1 exerted an inhibitory effect on its PA phosphatase activity by reduction of its catalytic efficiency. Mutational analysis of the major phosphorylation sites (Thr163, Thr164, and Ser602) indicated that Rim11-mediated phosphorylation at these sites was required to ensure Nem1-Spo7-dependent localization of the enzyme to the membrane. Overall, these findings advance our understanding of the phosphorylation-mediated regulation of Pah1 function in lipid synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W4283731058,"The stinging hairs of plants from the family Urticaceae inject compounds that inflict pain to deter herbivores. The sting of the New Zealand tree nettle (Urtica ferox) is among the most painful of these and can cause systemic symptoms that can even be life-threatening; however, the molecular species effecting this response have not been elucidated. Here we reveal that two classes of peptide toxin are responsible for the symptoms of U. ferox stings: Δ-Uf1a is a cytotoxic thionin that causes pain via disruption of cell membranes, while β/δ-Uf2a defines a new class of neurotoxin that causes pain and systemic symptoms via modulation of voltage-gated sodium (NaV) channels. We demonstrate using whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology experiments that β/δ-Uf2a is a potent modulator of human NaV1.5 (EC50: 55 nM), NaV1.6 (EC50: 0.86 nM), and NaV1.7 (EC50: 208 nM), where it shifts the activation threshold to more negative potentials and slows fast inactivation. We further found that both toxin classes are widespread among members of the Urticeae tribe within Urticaceae, suggesting that they are likely to be pain-causing agents underlying the stings of other Urtica species. Comparative analysis of nettles of Urtica, and the recently described pain-causing peptides from nettles of another genus, Dendrocnide, indicates that members of tribe Urticeae have developed a diverse arsenal of pain-causing peptides."
https://openalex.org/W4283748330,"WW domain-containing E3 Ubiquitin-protein ligase 2 (WWP2) has been found to positively regulate odontoblastic differentiation by monoubiquitinating the transcription factor Kruppel-like factor 5 (KLF5) in a cell culture system. However, the in vivo role of WWP2 in mouse teeth remains unknown. To explore this, here we generated Wwp2 knockout (Wwp2 KO) mice. We found that molars in Wwp2 KO mice exhibited thinner dentin, widened predentin, and reduced numbers of dentinal tubules. In addition, expression of the odontoblast differentiation markers Dspp and Dmp1 was decreased in the odontoblast layers of Wwp2 KO mice. These findings demonstrate that WWP2 may facilitate odontoblast differentiation and dentinogenesis. Furthermore, we show for the first time that phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), a tumor suppressor, is expressed in dental papilla cells and odontoblasts of mouse molars and acts as a negative regulator of odontoblastic differentiation. Further investigation indicated that PTEN is targeted by WWP2 for degradation during odontoblastic differentiation. We demonstrate PTEN physically interacts with and inhibits the transcriptional activity of KLF5 on Dspp and Dmp1. Finally, we found WWP2 was able to suppress the interaction between PTEN and KLF5, which diminished the inhibition effect of PTEN on KLF5. Taken together, this study confirms the essential role of WWP2 and the WWP2-PTEN-KLF5 signaling axis in odontoblast differentiation and dentinogenesis in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W4283766604,"The animal cell polarity regulator Par-3 recruits the Par complex (consisting of Par-6 and atypical PKC, aPKC) to specific sites on the cell membrane. Although numerous physical interactions have been reported between Par-3 and the Par complex, it is unclear how each of these interactions contributes to the overall binding. Using a purified, intact Par complex and a quantitative binding assay, here, we found that the energy required for this interaction is provided by the second and third PDZ protein interaction domains of Par-3. We show that both Par-3 PDZ domains bind to the PDZ-binding motif of aPKC in the Par complex, with additional binding energy contributed from the adjacent catalytic domain of aPKC. In addition to highlighting the role of Par-3 PDZ domain interactions with the aPKC kinase domain and PDZ-binding motif in stabilizing Par-3-Par complex assembly, our results indicate that each Par-3 molecule can potentially recruit two Par complexes to the membrane during cell polarization. These results provide new insights into the energetic determinants and structural stoichiometry of the Par-3-Par complex assembly."
https://openalex.org/W4283801792,"Regulation of innate inflammation is critical for maintaining tissue homeostasis and barrier function, especially in those interfacing the external environments such as the skin and cornea. Expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines by injured tissues has been shown to exacerbate the inflammatory cascade, causing tissue damage. Interleukin 36, a subfamily of the IL-1 superfamily, consists of three pro-inflammatory agonists-IL36α, IL36β, and IL36γ and an IL36 receptor antagonist (IL36Ra). The current investigation, for the first time, reports that IL36γ is the primary agonist expressed by the corneal epithelium, which is significantly upregulated following corneal injury. The function of IL36γ on non-immune cells, in addition to innate inflammatory cells, in regulating tissue homeostasis has not been well investigated. Using a loss-of-function approach via neutralizing antibody treatment, our data demonstrate that blocking endogenously expressed IL36γ in epithelial cells promotes rapid re-epithelialization in in vitro wound closure assay. Finally, by utilizing a naturally occurring antagonist IL36Ra in a well-established murine model of ocular injury, our study demonstrates that inhibition of IL36γ accelerates epithelial regeneration and suppresses tissue inflammation. Given rapid wound healing is critical for re-establishing normal tissue structure and function, our investigation on the function of IL36γ provides evidence for the development of novel IL36γ-targeting strategies to promote tissue repair."
https://openalex.org/W4283726552,"Hydrophobic cores are fundamental structural properties of proteins typically associated with protein folding and stability; however, how the hydrophobic core shapes protein evolution and function is poorly understood. Here, we investigated the role of conserved hydrophobic cores in fold-A glycosyltransferases (GT-As), a large superfamily of enzymes that catalyze formation of glycosidic linkages between diverse donor and acceptor substrates through distinct catalytic mechanisms (inverting versus retaining). Using hidden Markov models and protein structural alignments, we identify similarities in the phosphate-binding cassette (PBC) of GT-As and unrelated nucleotide-binding proteins, such as UDP-sugar pyrophosphorylases. We demonstrate that GT-As have diverged from other nucleotide-binding proteins through structural elaboration of the PBC and its unique hydrophobic tethering to the F-helix, which harbors the catalytic base (xED-Asp). While the hydrophobic tethering is conserved across diverse GT-A fold enzymes, some families, such as B3GNT2, display variations in tethering interactions and core packing. We evaluated the structural and functional impact of these core variations through experimental mutational analysis and molecular dynamics simulations and find that some of the core mutations (T336I in B3GNT2) increase catalytic efficiency by modulating the conformational occupancy of the catalytic base between “D-in” and acceptor-accessible “D-out” conformation. Taken together, our studies support a model of evolution in which the GT-A core evolved progressively through elaboration upon an ancient PBC found in diverse nucleotide-binding proteins, and malleability of this core provided the structural framework for evolving new catalytic and substrate-binding functions in extant GT-A fold enzymes.

Glycosyltransferases (GTs) are a diverse family of enzymes that catalyze the formation of glycosidic linkages between sugars and other macromolecules (1Varki A. Cummings R.D. Esko J.D. Stanley P. Hart G.W. Aebi M. Essentials of Glycobiology. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2015Google Scholar). These enzymes are found across the tree of life and are involved in a number of critical cellular functions through post-translational modifications, including protein folding, signaling, and stability (1Varki A.

Based on the catalytic mechanism, GTs are broadly classified as “inverting” or “retaining” based on the stereochemistry of the glycosidic bond they generate (Fig. S1). Inverting GTs generally employ a direct SN2 displacement mechanism with a protein-associated catalytic base that deprotonates the acceptor nucleophile hydroxyl leading to attack on the anomeric center and displacement of the nucleotide diphosphate–leaving group. By contrast, retaining GTs do not use an enzyme side chain as catalytic base but instead are generally considered to employ a same-side SNi-type mechanism where the acceptor hydroxyl nucleophile is deprotonated by the donor β-phosphate oxygen and attacks the anomeric carbon atom of the donor sugar from the same side as the leaving nucleotide (8Moremen K.W. Haltiwanger R.S. Emerging structural insights into glycosyltransferase-mediated synthesis of glycans.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2019; 15: 853-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). While there are rare examples of unusual GTs that presumably employ a double-displacement mechanism (9Kimber M.S. Forrester T.J.B. Mallette E. Ovchinnikova O.G. Nothof J.T.

A vast majority of GTs fall within the GT-A fold, which is characterized by the Rossmann fold–like α/β/α sandwich topology adopted by a diverse class of nucleotide-binding proteins unrelated to GTs (1Varki A.

We recently reported a deep evolutionary classification of GT-A fold sequences into 53 (sub)families that broadly fall into nine different clades and identified the core structural features shared among diverse GT-A fold enzymes (13Taujale R.

Rasheed K.M. et al.Deep evolutionary analysis reveals the design principles of fold A glycosyltransferases.Elife. 2020; 9e54532Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). These core features include two motifs (DxD and xED) involved in catalytic functions as well as an extended network of hydrophobic residues connecting the catalytic and nucleotide-binding sites. While a majority of these conserved hydrophobic residues are present in other Rossmann fold enzymes, a subset of them are unique to GT-A fold enzymes and undergo family specific variations (13Taujale R.

For example, in the B3GNT2 family of GT-A fold enzymes, one of the conserved hydrophobic residues in the F-helix is selectively replaced by a family specific threonine, without any apparent change in the overall structure or fold (14Kadirvelraj R.

Furthermore, in a subset of GT-A families such as GT6 and GT8, the GT-A–specific residues are frequently mutated in cancer subtypes (Table S1). However, the structural and functional roles of these natural and disease variations in the core are largely unknown. Nearly all folded proteins are characterized by hydrophobic residues in the core that contribute to protein folding and stability (15Baldwin E.P. Matthews B.W.

The nonoptimal packing of the core provides a selective advantage in some proteins, such as protein kinases, which are dynamically assembled during regulation of catalysis. Protein kinases contain an extended hydrophobic network connecting the ATP and substrate-binding lobes, termed the “spines,” which are dynamically assembled during kinase activation (22Kornev A.P. Taylor S.S. Defining the conserved internal architecture of a protein kinase.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1804: 440-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) and the suboptimal packing of the spine residues enable dynamic regulation of catalytic activity (19Chen J. Stites W.E.

Sci. 2018; 19E916Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar), but the role of conserved core in GT-A evolution and function has not been systematically investigated. Here using a combination of structural bioinformatics and experimental studies, we investigate the role of conserved hydrophobic core in GT-A structure, function, and evolution. Based on the identification of an ancient phosphate-binding cassette (PBC; (28Longo L.M. Jabłońska J. Vyas P. Kanade M. Kolodny R. Ben-Tal N. et al.On the emergence of P-Loop NTPase and Rossmann enzymes from a Beta-Alpha-Beta ancestral fragment.Elife. 2020; 9e64415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Fig. 1) shared by GT-As and other nucleotide-binding proteins, we dissect the hydrophobic core of GT-A enzymes into three categories: residues shared among PBC-containing enzymes, residues shared by Rossmann fold proteins, and residues unique to the GT-A core. We perform an in-depth structural analysis of the GT core–specific residues (residues 156 and 183) connecting the PBC and the αF-helix and find a strong correlation between hydrophobic packing and catalytic mechanism (inverting versus retaining). We propose that a dynamic GT-A core provides a selective advantage by enabling new modes of donor- and acceptor-binding functions. Our studies support a model in which the GT-A core evolved progressively through elaboration of an ancient PBC found in diverse nucleotide phosphate–binding proteins. Implications of our findings in the synthetic design of GTs and characterization of oncogenic mutations mapping to the core are discussed. Recently, an ancestral PBC shared among P-loop NTPases and Rossmann fold enzymes was reported (28Longo L.M. Jabłońska J. Vyas P. Kanade M. Kolodny R. Ben-Tal N. et al.On the emergence of P-Loop NTPase and Rossmann enzymes from a Beta-Alpha-Beta ancestral fragment.Elife. 2020; 9e64415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This includes several major enzyme superfamilies, such as pyrophosphorylases, oxidoreductases, epimerases, and hydrolases. Now, based on further structural comparisons (see the Experimental procedures section), we extend the presence of this ancestral PBC to GT-As (Fig. 1). We used hidden Markov models (HMMs) from previously published PBC themes (28Longo L.M. Jabłońska J. Vyas P. Kanade M. Kolodny R. Ben-Tal N. et al.On the emergence of P-Loop NTPase and Rossmann enzymes from a Beta-Alpha-Beta ancestral fragment.Elife. 2020; 9e64415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which produced significant hits to the PBC of GT-As. Different enzyme families have variable structural topologies of the PBC (28Longo L.M. Jabłońska J. Vyas P. Kanade M. Kolodny R. Ben-Tal N. et al.On the emergence of P-Loop NTPase and Rossmann enzymes from a Beta-Alpha-Beta ancestral fragment.Elife. 2020; 9e64415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By performing an all-versus-all structural comparison of a representative set of these different PBCs, we identify clusters of PBCs that further support structural and functional similarities between the GT-A PBC and NDP-sugar pyrophosphorylases (Fig. S4). GT-A PBCs closely resemble that of Rossmann pyrophosphorylases in terms of overall topology. Notably, both pyrophosphorylases and GT-As consistently use metal ions to bind the dinucleotide phosphate. Specifically, UDP-sugar pyrophosphorylases bind a UTP donor and sugar-1-phosphate acceptor and catalyze the formation of a UDP-sugar substrate, which is used as a donor substrate for both GT-A and GT-B fold enzymes (1Varki A. Cummings R.D. Esko J.D. Stanley P. Hart G.W. Aebi M. Essentials of Glycobiology. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2015Google Scholar). Structural alignment of the PBCs (using Protein Data Bank [PDB] IDs: 3OH3 and 2Z87) reveals similar PBC topologies for cofactor and nucleotide binding in these two enzymes (Figs. S2–S5). Matching homology from the HMM analysis and the structural alignment suggest a shared ancestry between these two protein families, although the possibility of convergent evolution of a common phosphate-binding mode cannot be ruled out. GT-A PBCs differ from most other Rossmann fold enzymes and P-loop NTPases by flipping the topological orientation and replacing the glycine-rich loop (located between the β1 sheet and α1 helix) with an additional pseudo beta bridge (β′), shifting the binding site for both the ligand and divalent cation (Figs. 1B and S2). Likewise, elaboration of the loop connecting β1 and α1 helix in GT-A through insertion of the metal coordinating DxD motif further contributes to structural and functional divergence of GT-A PBC from other Rossman enzymes (Figs. 1B and S2). In GT-As, the PBC corresponds to β4, αD, and β6 (residues Y234 to G266 in PBC; Fig. 2A) containing the classic metal-binding DxD motif (1Varki A. Cummings R.D. Esko J.D. Stanley P. Hart G.W. Aebi M. Essentials of Glycobiology. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2015Google Scholar) and a miniature hydrophobic core (Fig. 2A). Delineation of the PBC allows us to further dissect the anatomy of the GT-A core into three hierarchical categories based on the depth of conservation of hydrophobic residues. We denote these residues based on the GT2 structure (PDB ID: 2Z87) and the consensus alignment numbering published in a previous study (alignment position indicated parenthetically). Residues present in the PBC include V235 (86), A236 (87), and V249 (100) (Figs. 2A and S6). Residues shared by Rossmann fold enzymes include I154 (1), V155 (2), I156 (3), L165 (13), L169 (17), L172 (20), V183 (32), I184 (33), V185 (34), V235 (86), and A236 (87) (Figs. 2B and S6); and residues unique to GT-A fold enzymes include V249 (100), F340 (156), and F365 (183) (Figs. 2C and S6). Hydrophobic residues shared by Rossmann fold enzymes tether the PBC to the N-lobe (αA-helix), whereas residues unique to GT-A fold enzymes tether the PBC to the αF-helix in the C-lobe. In particular, the GT-A–specific hydrophobic residue in the F-helix (F365; position 183 in Fig. 2C) mediate a van der Waals interaction with hydrophobic residues in the PBC (F340 position in Fig. 2C) and a backbone hydrogen bond with the catalytic xED-Asp. Because the C-lobe tethering of the PBC is unique to GT-As and represent the most recent addition in GT-A core evolution, we focus on the C-lobe tethering interaction (F340 and F365) in the following sections. We performed a detailed analysis of the structural interactions mediated by tether residues (at positions 156 [F340] and 183 [F365]) in representative crystal structures to investigate their role in GT-A fold structure. Analysis of the contact distances between these residues indicates significant variability in side-chain contact distances (ranging from 4 to 14 Å) across diverse GT-A enzymes. Further analysis of these distances in inverting and retaining enzymes revealed strong correlation between contact distance and catalytic mechanism (p = 1.61E-13, using a two-tailed t test) (Fig. 3A, Supp File 156-183_dist). In inverting GT-As, the hydrophobic contact distance between 156 and 183 is in the range of 4 to 7 Å, whereas in the majority of retaining GT-As, the median distance between these residues increases significantly, with a normalized maxima around 10 Å. Retaining GT-As form a bimodal distribution, where several retaining GT-As have a contact distance between 4 and 7 Å. We observe these retaining GT-As to appear in clades containing previously phylogenetically classified subfamilies (12Breton C. Snajdrová L. Jeanneau C. Koca J. Imberty A. Structures and mechanisms of glycosyltransferases.Glycobiology. 2006; 16: 29R-37RCrossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar) of the large GT2 CAZy family, thus we term these as “GT2 related” (Figs. 3A and S7). GT2s are more primordial (12Breton C. Snajdrová L. Jeanneau C. Koca J. Imberty A. Structures and mechanisms of glycosyltransferases.Glycobiology. 2006; 16: 29R-37RCrossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar), and as such, we note that retaining enzymes related to GT2 have largely maintained a spacing consistent with the more constrained inverting enzymes. More distant retaining GT-As appear to have a less tightly packed C-lobe tether (Fig. 3, B and C). While the catalytic base (xED-Asp) is conserved in inverting GTs, in retaining enzymes, the xED-Asp is often replaced by a glutamine or a glutamate, which shifts the site of catalysis by >2 Å (8Moremen K.W. Haltiwanger R.S. Emerging structural insights into glycosyltransferase-mediated synthesis of glycans.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2019; 15: 853-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), preventing it from being used as a catalytic base. Instead of the xED motif, retaining GTs use the β-phosphate oxygen of the UDP-sugar donor as a catalytic base and perform a dissociative SNi-type reaction mechanism (8Moremen K.W. Haltiwanger R.S. Emerging structural insights into glycosyltransferase-mediated synthesis of glycans.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2019; 15: 853-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To determine whether the loss of constraint on the xED-Asp in retaining enzymes correlates with packing in the C-lobe tether, we analyzed the nature of residues surrounding the tether in primary sequences and 3D structures (Fig. 4). Comparisons of inverting and retaining GTs indicate differences in both xED-Asp position as well as residues involved in C-lobe tether (Fig. 4A). We further compare core packing interactions between representative GT-A crystal structures, and note that the retaining GT-As have a less tightly packed tether because of a substitution of a flexible methionine (M322) by a valine (V235), which alters core packing (Figs. 4, B and C and S3). In a subset of GTs, such as GT15, the hydrophobic tether is replaced by a salt bridge interaction (Fig. S9). Likewise, in B3GNT2 (GT31), a conserved water molecule is involved in the tethering interaction (Fig. S9E). The structural and functional implications of these family specific variations are discussed later. We next investigated the structural and functional implications of B3GNT2-specific variation in the C-lobe tether. In B3GNT2 crystal structures, the threonine (T336) side chain forms van der Waals interactions with hydrophobic residues (F156) in the phosphate-binding module to maintain the C-lobe tether. Also, the small size of the threonine side chain creates internal cavities that are occupied by a water molecule, which coordinate with the hydroxyl group of T336 side chain as well as the xED-Asp. To investigate the structural and functional implications of these B3GNT2-specific variations, we performed a computational and experimental screen of different variants at position 183 (T336). A computational screen using Rosetta predicted a subset of stabilizing and destabilizing mutations (Fig. 5A). With these predicted sets of stabilizing and destabilizing mutations, we then experimentally expressed a subset of single and double mutants (F309W, T336I, Y311I/T336V, Y311F/T336I, Y311F/T336Y, and Y311F/T336V) through recombinant expression in human embryonic kidney 293 cells (14Kadirvelraj R.

Comparison of human poly-N-acetyl-lactosamine synthase structure with GT-A fold glycosyltransferases supports a modular assembly of catalytic subsites.J. Biol. Chem. 2021; 296100110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). All the generated mutants expressed at detectable levels and did not impair folding or secretion (Table S3 and Fig. S10). We next examined the thermostability and catalytic activity of these mutants using thermal shift assays and Promega UDP-Glo assays, respectively. The mutants altered thermal stability to varying degrees. While T336I, Y311F/T336I, and Y311F/T336V were partially destabilizing (∼2 °C relative to wt), F309W, Y311I/T336V, and Y311F/T336V were more destabilizing (>4 °C relative to wt) (Fig. 5B). Analysis of the kinetic efficiency (kcat/Km) of the mutants revealed varying impact on substrate affinity (Km) and turnover (kcat). In particular, catalytic activity of T336I increases by approximately twofold relative to wt, under acceptor and donor saturation (Fig. 5, C and D and Table S2). The Km of T336I increased twofold under acceptor saturation and decreased by 0.15-fold under donor saturation. The catalytic efficiency of T336I increased by 1.3-fold and 2.5-fold under acceptor and donor saturations, respectively (Fig. 5D and Table S2). On the other hand, the F309W mutant displayed catalytic efficiency comparable to wt upon acceptor saturation, and a 1.93-fold increase in efficiency upon donor saturation, despite reduced thermostability. The other mutants, generally, displayed decreased catalytic efficiency relative to wt (Table S2). To investigate the structural basis for the increased activity observed for the T336I mutant, we performed microsecond time-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of wt and mutant B3GNT2 (Fig. 6), focusing on the conformational changes associated with the xED-Asp. In the crystal structure, the xED-Asp (D333) exists in two distinct conformations: D-in and D-out. In the D-in conformation, the xED-Asp is pointing toward the hydrophobic core and forms a water-mediated hydrogen bonding network with T336. In the D-out conformation, the xED-Asp points out toward the acceptor-binding site and forms a hydrogen bond with a hydroxyl group in the acceptor-bound complex where it acts as catalytic base (Fig. 6A). In the MD simulations of wt B3GNT2, both these conformations are equally sampled in the apo and acceptor-bound complexes (Fig. 6B). However, in the T336I mutant, the xED-Asp is predominantly observed in the D-out conformation. The D-in conformation is not sampled as frequently in the mutant, since the Ile substitution occludes the water-binding site in wt B3GNT2. The shift in the conformational occupancy of the xED-Asp in the acceptor-bound “out” conformation may explain the partial increase in catalytic activity observed for the T336I mutant because the xED-Asp is readily able to deprotonate the acceptor. We further note that in the crystal structure of the closest relative, Manic fringe (PDB ID: 2J0A (29Jinek M. Chen Y.-W. Clausen H. Cohen S.M. Conti E. Structural insights into the Notch-modifying glycosyltransferase fringe.Nat. Struct. Mol.

https://openalex.org/W4283781291,"Manganese (II) accumulation in human brain microvascular endothelial cells is mediated by the metal-ion transporters ZRT IRT-like protein 8 (ZIP8) and ZRT IRT-like protein 14 (ZIP14). The plasma membrane occupancy of ZIP14, in particular, is increased in cells treated with Mn2+, lipopolysaccharide, or IL-6, but the mechanism of this regulation has not been elucidated. The calcium-transporting type 2C member 1 ATPase, SPCA1, is a Golgi-localized Ca2+-uptake transporter thought to support Golgi uptake of Mn2+ also. Here, we show using surface protein biotinylation, indirect immunofluorescence, and GFP-tagged proteins that cytoplasmic Ca2+ regulates ZIP8- and ZIP14-mediated manganese accumulation in human brain microvascular endothelial cells by increasing the plasma membrane localization of these transporters. We demonstrate that RNAi knockdown of SPCA1 expression results in an increase in cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels. In turn, we found increased cytoplasmic Ca2+ enhances membrane-localized ZIP8 and ZIP14 and a subsequent increase in 54Mn2+ uptake. Furthermore, overexpression of WT SPCA1 or a gain-of-function mutant resulted in a decrease in cytoplasmic Ca2+ and 54Mn2+ accumulation. While addition of Ca2+ positively regulated ZIP-mediated 54Mn2+ uptake, we show chelation of Ca2+ diminished manganese transport. In conclusion, the modulation of ZIP8 and ZIP14 membrane cycling by cytoplasmic calcium is a novel finding and provides new insight into the regulation of the uptake of Mn2+ and other divalent metal ions-mediated ZIP metal transporters."
https://openalex.org/W4284675079,"Background Anemia adversely affects children’s mental, physical and social development, particularly in Africa. In the early stages of life, it leads to severe negative consequences on the cognitive, growth and development of children. Objective This study aimed to assess anemia and associated risk factors among children under-five years old in the West Guji Zone, southern Ethiopia, from October to November 2020. Method A hospital-based quantitative cross-sectional study was conducted at Bule Hora General Hospital, Southern Ethiopia. A convenience sampling technique was used to include 375 under-five children enrolled in the study. The pretested structure questionnaire was used to collect socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of study individuals after taking appropriate written informed consent. Then, a venous blood sample was collected from each child and analyzed for hemoglobin determination using a Midray BC 3000 Plus machine. Binary logistic regression models were used to identify associated factors of anemia. A p-value ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Result The overall prevalence of anemia among under-five children was 13.2% (50) [95% CI = 5.2–21.2%]. Among anemic children under-five years of age, 12% (6) had mild anemia, 32% (16) had moderate anemia and 56% (28) had severe anemia. In this study, anemia was significantly associated with a history of intestinal protozoan infection [AOR = 2.55, 95% CI = 1.28–10.42], malaria infection [AOR = 5.01, 95% CI = 0.18–11.44] and soil-transmitted helminths infection [AOR = 6.39, 95% CI = 1.75–29.08]. Conclusion The prevalence of anemia among under-five children was found to be low in the study area; however, the majority of anemic children were in a severe stage. It could be managed by preventing malaria infection, intestinal protozoa and soil-transmitted helminthic infection."
https://openalex.org/W4284690976,"Introduction In India, smokeless tobacco (SLT) is a predominant form of tobacco used among people living with HIV (PLHIV). Despite SLT being a risk factor for oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMDs), no prior studies have quantified the association of OPMDs with SLT use among PLHIV. This limits the planning of preventive and control strategies for oral cancer among PLHIV, who are at higher risk for the disease. Methods We enrolled 601 PLHIV and 633 HIV-uninfected individuals in an oral cancer screening study at BJ Government Medical College, Pune, India. Oral cavity images were collected using an m-Health application and reviewed by three clinicians. Participants with two clinician positive diagnoses were deemed to have suspected OPMDs. Prevalence ratios (PRs) were used to quantify the association between suspected OPMDs and SLT use among PLHIV. PRs for current SLT users, across HIV status and use duration were also estimated. Corrected PRs were obtained by modifying the maximum likelihood estimation. Models were adjusted for age, smoking, alcohol use and CD4 counts. Results Of those enrolled, 61% were men, median age was 36 years (IQR: 28–44), and 33% currently use SLT. Proportion of current SLT users was similar across PLHIV and HIV-uninfected groups but use duration for current SLT use was higher among PLHIV(p&lt;0.05). Among PLHIV, current SLT users had a 5-times (95% CI:3.1–7.0) higher prevalence of suspected OPMDs, compared to non-users. Relative to HIV uninfected individuals with the same SLT use duration, significant associations with suspected OPMDs were seen for PLHIV with&lt;10 use years (PR: 3.5, 95% CI: 1.5–8.1) but not for PLHIV with≥10 use years (PR: 1.3, 95% CI: 0.9–1.8). Conclusion PLHIV that are current SLT users are at high risk of OPMDs and potentially oral cancer. The development of strategies for screening, early detection, and management of OPMDs must be considered for this group."
https://openalex.org/W4284698636,"In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, elite sport leagues implemented hubs, or 'bubbles', which restricted athletes' movements and social interactions in order to minimise the risk of athlete infection and allow competitions to continue. This was a new way of working and living for elite athletes and there was a dearth of literature on this topic. The main objective of the study was to investigate the impacts of the hub model on athletes over time, and what job demands and resources existed for athletes through the application of Demerouti et al. (2001) Job Demands-Resources Model. Multiple sequential semi-structured interviews were conducted with Women's National Basketball League (WNBL) athletes during the 2020 season, which was held entirely in a hub in North Queensland, Australia. The key job demands in an elite sport hub identified were the volume of work, simultaneous overload and underload, and nature of work in the hub. The key resources that emerged include recovery services, control and player agency, and constructive social relations. Despite the presence of job resources, which work to counteract, or buffer job demands in order to reduce work stress and improve motivation, they were found to be insufficient for athletes and inequitably distributed between clubs. The intensity of the hub model also amplified demands present in all WNBL seasons. This research is therefore useful for planning of future elite sport leagues to improve the type and amount of resources available to athletes, thereby improving athlete wellbeing and performance both within and outside a hub model."
https://openalex.org/W4284708381,"When a patient is admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) after a traumatic brain injury (TBI), an early prognosis is essential for baseline risk adjustment and shared decision making. TBI outcomes are commonly categorised by the Glasgow Outcome Scale–Extended (GOSE) into eight, ordered levels of functional recovery at 6 months after injury. Existing ICU prognostic models predict binary outcomes at a certain threshold of GOSE (e.g., prediction of survival [GOSE &gt; 1]). We aimed to develop ordinal prediction models that concurrently predict probabilities of each GOSE score. From a prospective cohort ( n = 1,550, 65 centres) in the ICU stratum of the Collaborative European NeuroTrauma Effectiveness Research in TBI (CENTER-TBI) patient dataset, we extracted all clinical information within 24 hours of ICU admission (1,151 predictors) and 6-month GOSE scores. We analysed the effect of two design elements on ordinal model performance: (1) the baseline predictor set, ranging from a concise set of ten validated predictors to a token-embedded representation of all possible predictors, and (2) the modelling strategy, from ordinal logistic regression to multinomial deep learning. With repeated k -fold cross-validation, we found that expanding the baseline predictor set significantly improved ordinal prediction performance while increasing analytical complexity did not. Half of these gains could be achieved with the addition of eight high-impact predictors to the concise set. At best, ordinal models achieved 0.76 (95% CI: 0.74–0.77) ordinal discrimination ability (ordinal c -index) and 57% (95% CI: 54%– 60%) explanation of ordinal variation in 6-month GOSE (Somers’ D xy ). Model performance and the effect of expanding the predictor set decreased at higher GOSE thresholds, indicating the difficulty of predicting better functional outcomes shortly after ICU admission. Our results motivate the search for informative predictors that improve confidence in prognosis of higher GOSE and the development of ordinal dynamic prediction models."
https://openalex.org/W4283745615,"Ephrin-B signaling has been implicated in many normal and pathological processes, including neural crest development and tumor metastasis. We showed previously that proteolysis of ephrin-B ligands by the disintegrin metalloprotease ADAM13 is necessary for canonical Wnt signal activation and neural crest induction in Xenopus, but it was unclear if these mechanisms are conserved in mammals. Here, we report that mammalian ADAM9 cleaves ephrin-B1 and ephrin-B2 and can substitute for Xenopus ADAM13 to induce the neural crest. We found that ADAM9 expression is elevated in human colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues and that knockdown (KD) of ADAM9 inhibits the migration and invasion of SW620 and HCT116 CRC cells by reducing the activity of Akt kinase, which is antagonized by ephrin-Bs. Akt is a signaling node that activates multiple downstream pathways, including the Wnt and mTOR pathways, both of which can promote CRC cell migration/invasion. Surprisingly, we also found that KD of ADAM9 downregulates Wnt signaling but has negligible effects on mTOR signaling in SW620 cells; in contrast, mTOR activity is suppressed while Wnt signaling remains unaffected by ADAM9 KD in HCT116 cells. These results suggest that mammalian ADAM9 cleaves ephrin-Bs to derepress Akt and promote CRC migration and invasion; however, the signaling pathways downstream of Akt are differentially regulated by ADAM9 in different CRC cell lines, reflecting the heterogeneity of CRC cells in responding to manipulations of upstream Akt regulators.

The Eph receptors are the largest class of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and key regulators of cell adhesion, migration, and sorting. These receptors can be divided into two subclasses based on their cognate ligands: EphA receptors, which preferentially bind the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored ephrin-A ligands, and EphB receptors, which preferentially bind the transmembrane ephrin-B ligands (1Hwang Y.S. Daar I.O. A frog's view of EphrinB signaling.Genesis. 2017; https://doi.org/10.1002/dvg.23002Google Scholar, 2Taylor H. Campbell J. Nobes C.D. Ephs and ephrins.Curr. Biol. 2017; 27: R90-R95Google Scholar). Unlike the prototypical RTK pathways, which activate downstream Ras-Erk and PI3K-Akt signaling, activation of Eph receptors by the ephrin ligands (“forward” signaling) often results in inhibited Ras-Erk and Akt activities (3Lisabeth E.M. Falivelli G. Pasquale E.B. Eph receptor signaling and ephrins.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2013; 5a009159Google Scholar). In addition, Eph–ephrin interactions can also stimulate “reverse” signaling in ligand-expressing cells (1Hwang Y.S. Daar I.O. A frog's view of EphrinB signaling.Genesis. 2017; https://doi.org/10.1002/dvg.23002Google Scholar, 2Taylor H. Campbell J. Nobes C.D. Ephs and ephrins.Curr.

Bacani J. Begthel H. Jonkheer S. Gregorieff A. van de Born M. et al.EphB receptor activity suppresses colorectal cancer progression.Nature. 2005; 435: 1126-1130Google Scholar, 6Brantley-Sieders D.M. Clinical relevance of Ephs and ephrins in cancer: lessons from breast, colorectal, and lung cancer profiling.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2012; 23: 102-108Google Scholar). Protein ectodomain shedding, often mediated by members of A Disintegrin and Metalloprotease (ADAM) family, is a key mechanism for regulating cell signaling (7Lichtenthaler S.F. Lemberg M.K. Fluhrer R. Proteolytic ectodomain shedding of membrane proteins in mammals-hardware, concepts, and recent developments.EMBO J. 2018; 37Google Scholar). ADAMs are multidomain type I transmembrane proteins consisting of extracellular pro-, metalloprotease, disintegrin, and cysteine-rich domains (8Wei S. ADAM metalloproteinases.in: Rawlings N.D. Guy S. The Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. Academic Press, Oxford2013: 1086-1094Google Scholar, 9Zadka L. Kulus M.J. Piatek K. ADAM protein family - its role in tumorigenesis, mechanisms of chemoresistance and potential as diagnostic and prognostic factors.Neoplasma. 2018; 65: 823-839Google Scholar). More than half of the ADAMs contain a conserved zinc-binding motif in the metalloprotease domain and can cleave (“shed”) the ectodomain of cell-surface substrates (8Wei S. ADAM metalloproteinases.in: Rawlings N.D. Guy S. The Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. Academic Press, Oxford2013: 1086-1094Google Scholar, 9Zadka L. Kulus M.J. Piatek K. ADAM protein family - its role in tumorigenesis, mechanisms of chemoresistance and potential as diagnostic and prognostic factors.Neoplasma. 2018; 65: 823-839Google Scholar). Several ADAMs are enriched in tumors and have important roles in various aspects of tumor progression, such as growth, chemoresistance, immune evasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis (9Zadka L. Kulus M.J. Piatek K. ADAM protein family - its role in tumorigenesis, mechanisms of chemoresistance and potential as diagnostic and prognostic factors.Neoplasma. 2018; 65: 823-839Google Scholar, 10Saha N. Robev D. Himanen J.P. Nikolov D.B. ADAM proteases: emerging role and targeting of the non-catalytic domains.Cancer Lett. 2019; 467: 50-57Google Scholar). Eph–ephrin interactions can be regulated by receptor or ligand ectodomain shedding, typically resulting in loss or termination of signaling (11Atapattu L. Lackmann M. Janes P.W. The role of proteases in regulating Eph/ephrin signaling.Cell Adh. Migr. 2014; 8: 294-307Google Scholar, 12Saha N. Robev D. Mason E.O. Himanen J.P. Nikolov D.B. Therapeutic potential of targeting the Eph/ephrin signaling complex.Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2018; 105: 123-133Google Scholar). One interesting example is the shedding of EphA2 receptor by MMP14, a metalloprotease distantly related to ADAMs, in tumor cells. This proteolytic event abrogates tumor-suppressive forward signaling and promotes oncogenic ligand-independent signaling, thereby converting EphA2 from a tumor suppressor to an oncoprotein (13Koshikawa N. Hoshino D. Taniguchi H. Minegishi T. Tomari T. Nam S.O. et al.Proteolysis of EphA2 converts it from a tumor suppressor to an oncoprotein.Cancer Res. 2015; 75: 3327-3339Google Scholar). Shedding also occurs on ephrin ligands, and the best characterized ephrin sheddase is ADAM10, which can cleave ephrin-A2, -A5 and -B2 (14Hattori M. Osterfield M. Flanagan J.G. Regulated cleavage of a contact-mediated axon repellent.Science. 2000; 289: 1360-1365Google Scholar, 15Janes P.W. Saha N. Barton W.A. Kolev M.V. Wimmer-Kleikamp S.H. Nievergall E. et al.Adam meets Eph: an ADAM substrate recognition module acts as a molecular switch for ephrin cleavage in trans.Cell. 2005; 123: 291-304Google Scholar, 16Ji Y.J. Hwang Y.S. Mood K. Cho H.J. Lee H.S. Winterbottom E. et al.EphrinB2 affects apical constriction in Xenopus embryos and is regulated by ADAM10 and flotillin-1.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5: 3516Google Scholar, 17Lagares D. Ghassemi-Kakroodi P. Tremblay C. Santos A. Probst C.K. Franklin A. et al.ADAM10-mediated ephrin-B2 shedding promotes myofibroblast activation and organ fibrosis.Nat. Med. 2017; 23: 1405-1415Google Scholar). Additionally, we have shown that shedding of ephrin-B1 and -B2 by ADAM13 attenuates forward ephrin-B signaling, which antagonizes the canonical Wnt pathway, to induce the neural crest and eye field in Xenopus embryos (18Wei S. Xu G. Bridges L.C. Williams P. White J.M. DeSimone D.W. ADAM13 induces cranial neural crest by cleaving class B Ephrins and regulating Wnt signaling.Dev. Cell. 2010; 19: 345-352Google Scholar, 19Wei S. Xu G. Bridges L.C. Williams P. Nakayama T. Shah A. et al.Roles of ADAM13-regulated Wnt activity in early Xenopus eye development.Dev. Biol. 2012; 363: 147-154Google Scholar). However, it remained unclear how ephrin-B shedding affects Wnt signaling, and whether these shedding events are conserved in mammals. In the present study, we found that mammalian ADAM9 cleaves ephrin-B1 and -B2 and can substitute for Xenopus ADAM13 in neural crest induction. ADAM9 mRNA is elevated in human CRC tissues and facilitates CRC cell migration and invasion in vitro via Akt activation. Our data further reveal that the Wnt and mTOR pathways downstream of Akt show different responses to ADAM9 knockdown (KD) in different CRC cell lines, likely due to the presence of different mutations in these cells. In a candidate screen to search for mammalian metalloproteases responsible for shedding key cell-surface proteins involved in Wnt signaling, we identified ADAM9 as a main sheddase for mouse ephrin-B1 and -B2 when coexpressed in HEK293T cells (Bahudhanapati et al., unpublished data). Since there is no good antibody for the ectodomain of either ephrin, we overexpressed both ephrins with an N-terminal HA tag. Western blotting detected a fragment of HA-tagged ephrin-B1 ectodomain shed into the conditioned media, which was enhanced when myc-tagged WT mouse ADAM9 but not the protease-dead E348A mutant was coexpressed (Fig. 1A). A similar cleavage product was detected for ephrin-B2, although coexpression of WT ADAM9 and longer exposure were needed (Fig. 1B). The shed ectodomain of both ephrins are ∼22 kDa, similar to the size of Xenopus ephrin-B2 shed by ADAM13 (18Wei S. Xu G. Bridges L.C. Williams P. White J.M. DeSimone D.W. ADAM13 induces cranial neural crest by cleaving class B Ephrins and regulating Wnt signaling.Dev. Cell. 2010; 19: 345-352Google Scholar), indicating that mouse ADAM9 and Xenopus ADAM13 cleave at the same region of ephrin-B ectodomain. Because ephrin-B1 appeared to be cleaved by endogenous ADAM9-like activity, we focused on ephrin-B1 for the rest of this study. To test if endogenous ADAM9 is responsible for cleaving ephrin-B1, we used two siRNAs to knock down ADAM9 in the CRC cell line HCT116, which expresses relatively high levels of ADAM9. Quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) results show that both siRNAs, AD9-1 and AD9-2, caused 70 to 80% reduction in ADAM9 mRNA, and Western blotting confirms that the endogenous ADAM9 protein was also markedly reduced (Fig. 1, C and D). Transfection with either siRNA decreased the ephrin-B1 ectodomain shed into the conditioned media and increased the full-length ephrin-B1 in the cell lysate (Fig. 1E and S1), pointing to ADAM9 as the main protease responsible for shedding ephrin-B1 in HCT116 cells. Similar effects were observed when ADAM9 was knocked down in SW620, another CRC cell line (Fig. 1F). It has been shown that ephrin-B1 and EphB3 are the only ephrin-B ligand and functional EphB receptor, respectively, detectable in HCT116 cells (20Herath N.I. Spanevello M.D. Doecke J.D. Smith F.M. Pouponnot C. Boyd A.W. Complex expression patterns of Eph receptor tyrosine kinases and their ephrin ligands in colorectal carcinogenesis.Eur. J. Cancer. 2012; 48: 753-762Google Scholar). KD of ADAM9 in these cells led to an increase in activated (phosphorylated) EphB3 (Fig. 1G), indicating an upregulation of forward ephrin-B signaling, possibly by blocking ligand cleavage. We further tested if mouse ADAM9 is the mammalian functional equivalent of Xenopus ADAM13. Like Xenopus ADAM13 (18Wei S. Xu G. Bridges L.C. Williams P. White J.M. DeSimone D.W. ADAM13 induces cranial neural crest by cleaving class B Ephrins and regulating Wnt signaling.Dev. Cell. 2010; 19: 345-352Google Scholar, 21Li J. Perfetto M. Neuner R. Bahudhanapati H. Christian L. Mathavan K. et al.Xenopus ADAM19 regulates Wnt signaling and neural crest specification by stabilizing ADAM13.Development. 2018; 145dev158154Google Scholar), ectopic mouse ADAM9 expanded the expression domain of snai2, a neural crest marker and Wnt target (22Li J. Perfetto M. Materna C. Li R. Thi Tran H. Vleminckx K. et al.A new transgenic reporter line reveals Wnt-dependent Snai2 re-expression and cranial neural crest differentiation in Xenopus.Sci. Rep. 2019; 9: 11191Google Scholar), and rescued the decrease of snai2 caused by ADAM13 morpholino in Xenopus tropicalis embryos (Fig. 1H). Thus, mammalian ADAM9 can functionally substitute for Xenopus ADAM13 to cleave ephrin-Bs and induce the neural crest. Since there is no established mammalian model for neural crest induction (23Barriga E.H. Trainor P.A. Bronner M. Mayor R. Animal models for studying neural crest development: Is the mouse different?.Development. 2015; 142: 1555-1560Google Scholar, 24Betters E. Charney R.M. Garcia-Castro M.I. Early specification and development of rabbit neural crest cells.Dev. Biol. 2018; 444: S181-S192Google Scholar), we decided to investigate the function of ADAM9 in other physiological contexts. Forward ephrin-B signaling is a tumor suppressor pathway that prevents CRC progression (5Batlle E. Bacani J. Begthel H. Jonkheer S. Gregorieff A. van de Born M. et al.EphB receptor activity suppresses colorectal cancer progression.Nature. 2005; 435: 1126-1130Google Scholar, 25Jägle S. Rönsch K. Timme S. Andrlová H. Bertrand M. Jäger M. et al.Silencing of the EPHB3 tumor-suppressor gene in human colorectal cancer through decommissioning of a transcriptional enhancer.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2014; 111: 4886-4891Google Scholar), whereas ADAM9 is highly expressed in multiple types of solid tumors, and the expression levels often correlate with tumor progression (26Oria V.O. Lopatta P. Schilling O. The pleiotropic roles of ADAM9 in the biology of solid tumors.Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2018; 75: 2291-2301Google Scholar). However, little is known about the endogenous expression and function of this protease in CRC. We therefore carried out RT-qPCR to determine the expression of ADAM9 in human CRC tissues. As shown in Figure 2A, ADAM9 mRNA was significantly upregulated in CRC tissues as compared with adjacent nontumorous tissues taken from the same patients, suggesting a role for this protease in CRC carcinogenesis and/or tumor progression. Indeed, KD of ADAM9 using the siRNA AD9-1 inhibited the migration and invasion of both SW620 and HCT116 cells, in transwell assays (Fig. 2, B and C). Similar inhibition was obtained in both cell lines using the siRNA AD9-2 (Fig. S2), confirming that these phenotypes are specific for ADAM9 KD. We previously attributed the ability of Xenopus ADAM13 to induce the neural crest to the proteolysis of ephrin-Bs and downregulation of forward ephrin-B signaling, which antagonize canonical Wnt signaling, a major signaling pathway that induces the neural crest (18Wei S. Xu G. Bridges L.C. Williams P. White J.M. DeSimone D.W. ADAM13 induces cranial neural crest by cleaving class B Ephrins and regulating Wnt signaling.Dev. Cell. 2010; 19: 345-352Google Scholar, 19Wei S. Xu G. Bridges L.C. Williams P. Nakayama T. Shah A. et al.Roles of ADAM13-regulated Wnt activity in early Xenopus eye development.Dev. Biol. 2012; 363: 147-154Google Scholar). KD of ADAM13 in X. tropicalis embryos inhibited endogenous Wnt activity at the neural plate border, where the neural crest is normally induced (18Wei S. Xu G. Bridges L.C. Williams P. White J.M. DeSimone D.W. ADAM13 induces cranial neural crest by cleaving class B Ephrins and regulating Wnt signaling.Dev. Cell. 2010; 19: 345-352Google Scholar, 21Li J. Perfetto M. Neuner R. Bahudhanapati H. Christian L. Mathavan K. et al.Xenopus ADAM19 regulates Wnt signaling and neural crest specification by stabilizing ADAM13.Development. 2018; 145dev158154Google Scholar). Likewise, KD of ADAM9 in HEK293T cells also reduced both the endogenous and ectopic β-catenin–induced Wnt activity in the TOP/FOPFLASH luciferase reporter assays (Fig. 3A). A similar reduction was observed in SW620 cells (Fig. 3B). Because Wnt signaling can facilitate CRC migration and invasion (27Nie X. Liu H. Liu L. Wang Y.D. Chen W.D. Emerging roles of wnt ligands in human colorectal cancer.Front. Oncol. 2020; 10: 1341Google Scholar), this result may explain the reduced migration/invasion of SW620 cells upon ADAM9 KD. Surprisingly, we were unable to detect a significant effect of ADAM9 KD on Wnt-mediated transcriptional activity in HCT116 cells using the TOP/FOPFLASH assays (Fig. 3C). The cellular levels of β-catenin are usually kept in check by the kinase GSK3, which forms a complex with the scaffold proteins adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and Axin to phosphorylate β-catenin at Thr41, Ser37, and Ser33 residues, leading to the ubiquitination and degradation of β-catenin. Binding of Wnt ligands to cell-surface Frizzled receptors and coreceptors causes inhibition and dissociation of the β-catenin destruction complex, and the stabilized β-catenin can translocate into the nucleus, where it functions as a transcriptional coactivator (28Nusse R. Clevers H. Wnt/β-Catenin signaling, disease, and emerging therapeutic modalities.Cell. 2017; 169: 985-999Google Scholar, 29Stamos J.L. Weis W.I. The β-catenin destruction complex.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2013; 5a007898Google Scholar). However, Wnt-mediated transcriptional activity does not always correlate with total β-catenin; instead, it correlates well with an “active” form of β-catenin, which is dephosphorylated at Thr41 and Ser37 by an unknown phosphatase and is mostly localized in the nucleus (30Staal F.J. van Noort M. Strous G.J. Clevers H.C. Wnt signals are transmitted through N-terminally dephosphorylated beta-catenin.EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 63-68Google Scholar). Our Western blotting analyses show that both total and active (nonphosphorylated) β-catenin levels were reduced in SW620 cells upon ADAM9 KD (Figs. 3D and S3A). In stark contrast, no reduction in active β-catenin was detected in HCT116 cells, despite a decrease of total β-catenin (Figs. 3E and S3B). The lack of reduction in active β-catenin provides an explanation for the lack of response of Wnt-mediated transcriptional activity to ADAM9 KD in HCT116 cells. If KD of ADAM9 has no effect on Wnt signaling in HCT116 cells, how does it inhibit the migration and invasion of these cells? To answer this question, we carried out RNA-seq analyses for HCT116 cells with control siRNA or siAD9-1. Among the 257 genes downregulated by siAD9-1, 31 were reported previously to be downregulated by mTOR inhibition (31Park Y. Reyna-Neyra A. Philippe L. Thoreen C.C. mTORC1 balances cellular amino acid supply with demand for protein Synthesis through post-transcriptional control of ATF4.Cell Rep. 2017; 19: 1083-1090Google Scholar), suggesting that KD of ADAM9 inhibits mTOR signaling (the complete RNA-seq data will be published elsewhere). RT-qPCR results confirm the reduced expression of CHAC1, DDIT4, and SLC1A4, three of the genes positively regulated by mTOR signaling (31Park Y. Reyna-Neyra A. Philippe L. Thoreen C.C. mTORC1 balances cellular amino acid supply with demand for protein Synthesis through post-transcriptional control of ATF4.Cell Rep. 2017; 19: 1083-1090Google Scholar), upon ADAM9 KD (Fig. 4, A–C). In line with this, KD of ADAM9 in HCT116 cells drastically reduced phospho-S6K, a signature mTOR target that facilitates tumor invasion including CRC invasion (32Pon Y.L. Zhou H.Y. Cheung A.N. Ngan H.Y. Wong A.S. p70 S6 kinase promotes epithelial to mesenchymal transition through snail induction in ovarian cancer cells.Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 6524-6532Google Scholar, 33Zhou H. Huang S. Role of mTOR signaling in tumor cell motility, invasion and metastasis.Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2011; 12: 30-42Google Scholar, 34Lu Q. Wang J. Yu G. Guo T. Hu C. Ren P. Expression and clinical significance of mammalian target of rapamycin/P70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase signaling pathway in human colorectal carcinoma tissue.Oncol. Lett. 2015; 10: 277-282Google Scholar), without affecting total S6K levels (Fig. 4D and S4A). A main upstream regulator of mTOR signaling is Akt, which activates mTOR primarily by phosphorylating and inhibiting tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2), a well-characterized mTOR inhibitor (35Manning B.D. Toker A. AKT/PKB signaling: navigating the network.Cell. 2017; 169: 381-405Google Scholar, 36Manning B.D. Cantley L.C. AKT/PKB signaling: navigating downstream.Cell. 2007; 129: 1261-1274Google Scholar). Importantly, Akt can also promote Wnt signaling through various mechanisms (37Fukumoto S. Hsieh C.M. Maemura K. Layne M.D. Yet S.F. Lee K.H. et al.Akt participation in the Wnt signaling pathway through Dishevelled.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17479-17483Google Scholar, 38Fang D. Hawke D. Zheng Y. Xia Y. Meisenhelder J. Nika H. et al.Phosphorylation of beta-catenin by AKT promotes beta-catenin transcriptional activity.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 11221-11229Google Scholar, 39Persad A. Venkateswaran G. Hao L. Garcia M.E. Yoon J. Sidhu J. et al.Active β-catenin is regulated by the PTEN/PI3 kinase pathway: a role for protein phosphatase PP2A.Genes Cancer. 2016; 7: 368-382Google Scholar). We therefore tested if ADAM9 regulates Akt activity. Indeed, transfection of HCT116 and SW620 cells with siAD9-1 reduced active (phospho-Ser473) Akt, while having little effect on total Akt (Fig. 4, D and E, S4, B and D). The inhibition of Akt activation by ADAM9 KD was confirmed using siAD9-2 (Fig. S5), suggesting that ADAM9 is required for Akt activation. However, the reduction in phospho-S6K was not significant in SW620 cells (Fig. 4E and S4C). Thus, while ADAM9 is indispensable for Akt activation in both cell lines, it appears to regulate the downstream Wnt and mTOR signaling differently in these cells. This phenomenon could be attributed to the underlying genetic mutations in these cell lines (see Discussion). We next tested if ADAM9 regulates CRC migration/invasion via ephrin-B signaling and Akt. Because SW620 cells are more migratory and invasive than HCT116 cells, we carried out loss- and gain-of-function experiments for ADAM9 in SW620 and HCT116 cells, respectively. As shown in Figure. 5, A and B, expression of a constitutively active form of Akt (40Kohn A.D. Takeuchi F. Roth R.A. Akt, a pleckstrin homology domain containing kinase, is activated primarily by phosphorylation.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21920-21926Google Scholar) rescued the reduced migration and invasion of SW620 cells caused by ADAM9 KD. As expected, the migration and invasion of HCT116 cells were enhanced by overexpressed ADAM9, and these effects were reversed by treating the cells with MK-2206, a selective Akt inhibitor (41Hirai H. Sootome H. Nakatsuru Y. Miyama K. Taguchi S. Tsujioka K. et al.MK-2206, an allosteric Akt inhibitor, enhances antitumor efficacy by standard chemotherapeutic agents or molecular targeted drugs in vitro and in vivo.Mol. Cancer Ther. 2010; 9: 1956-1967Google Scholar)(Fig. S6). To test if ADAM9 functions in CRC cell migration/invasion by downregulating ephrin-B signaling, we used siRNAs that effectively knocked down ephrin-B1 (Fig. S7). Transfection of SW620 cells with these siRNAs rescued ADAM9 KD-mediated reduction of migration and invasion (Fig. 5, C and D). Together, these results suggest that ADAM9 promotes CRC cell migration and invasion by modulating ephrin-B signaling and Akt activity. Finally, we asked how ADAM9 activates Akt. Akt is usually activated by PI3K, which can in turn be induced by growth factor–activated RTKs such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (35Manning B.D. Toker A. AKT/PKB signaling: navigating the network.Cell. 2017; 169: 381-405Google Scholar). A previous study has associated ADAM9 function in Akt regulation with EGFR activation (42Liu R. Gu J. Jiang P. Zheng Y. Liu X. Jiang X. et al.DNMT1-microRNA126 epigenetic circuit contributes to esophageal squamous cell carcinoma growth via ADAM9-EGFR-AKT signaling.Clin. Cancer Res. 2015; 21: 854-863Google Scholar). However, HCT116 cells contain a constitutively active PI3K mutation (Table S1), rendering Akt activity in these cells insensitive to growth factor stimulation (43Samuels Y. Diaz L.A. Schmidt-Kittler O. Cummins J.M. Delong L. Cheong I. et al.Mutant PIK3CA promotes cell growth and invasion of human cancer cells.Cancer Cell. 2005; 7: 561-573Google Scholar), and a recent report shows that ADAM9 activates Akt independently of EGFR (44Zhou R. Cho W.C.S. Ma V. Cheuk W. So Y.K. Wong S.C.C. et al.ADAM9 mediates triple-negative breast cancer progression via AKT/NF-κB pathway.Front. Med. (Lausanne). 2020; 7: 214Google Scholar). We have shown that KD of ADAM9 results in increased levels of intact ephrin-B1 and active EphB3 receptor (Figs. 1, E–G and S1). Forward ephrin signaling can suppress Akt activity, even in cancer cells with oncogenic mutations that activate the PI3K–Akt axis (3Lisabeth E.M. Falivelli G. Pasquale E.B. Eph receptor signaling and ephrins.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2013; 5a009159Google Scholar). In particular, forward ephrin-B signaling via EphB3 can promote Akt dephosphorylation through protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), leading to inhibition of lung cancer invasion (45Li G. Ji X.D. Gao H. Zhao J.S. Xu J.F. Sun Z.J. et al.EphB3 suppresses non-small-cell lung cancer metastasis via a PP2A/RACK1/Akt signalling complex.Nat. Commun. 2012; 3: 667Google Scholar). We therefore hypothesize that enhanced forward ephrin-B signaling mediates the inhibition of Akt and downstream signaling pathways upon ADAM9 KD. Consistent with this hypothesis, overexpression of an ephrin-B1 mutant with the cytoplasmic tail deleted (ephrin-B1ΔC), which can activate forward but not reverse signaling, inhibited Akt activity in HCT116 and SW620 cells, as well as ectopic β-catenin–induced Wnt signaling in HEK293T cells (Fig. 5, E and F and S8). Conversely, a dominant-negative EphB1 receptor with the kinase domain deleted (EphB1ΔK) enhanced AKT and Wnt activity in SW620 cells (Fig. S9, A and B). Of note, the inhibition of Wnt signaling by ephrin-B1ΔC in HEK293T cells can be partially rescued by the PP2A inhibitor okadaic acid (Fig. 5F), suggesting that forward ephrin-B signaling antagonizes Wnt signaling through PP2A. ADAM9 is a tumor-associated antigen highly expressed in many types of solid tumors and is involved in carcinogenesis and tumor progression, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood (26Oria V.O. Lopatta P. Schilling O. The pleiotropic roles of ADAM9 in the biology of solid tumors.Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2018; 75: 2291-2301Google Scholar, 46Chou C.W. Huang Y.K. Kuo T.T. Liu J.P. Sher Y.P. An overview of ADAM9: structure, activation, and regulation in human diseases.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2020; 21: 7790Google Scholar). We found that ADAM9 mRNA is also elevated in CRC tissues and identified Akt and downstream Wnt and mTOR signaling as the main targets for ADAM9 in CRC cells. Two published works have linked ADAM9 to Akt activity in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and triple-negative breast cancer, respectively (42Liu R. Gu J. Jiang P. Zheng Y. Liu X. Jiang X. et al.DNMT1-microRNA126 epigenetic circuit contributes to esophageal squamous cell carcinoma growth via ADAM9-EGFR-AKT signaling.Clin. Cancer Res. 2015; 21: 854-863Google Scholar, 44Zhou R. Cho W.C.S. Ma V. Cheuk W. So Y.K. Wong S.C.C. et al.ADAM9 mediates triple-negative breast cancer progression via AKT/NF-κB pathway.Front. Med. (Lausanne). 2020; 7: 214Google Scholar). Together with our results, these suggest that ADAM9 is a key Akt regulator in various tumors. While the first study attributed this function of ADAM9 to EGFR activation, presumably by shedding the EGFR ligand pro-heparin binding-EGF (pro-HB-EGF) (42Liu R. Gu J. Jiang P. Zheng Y. Liu X. Jiang X. et al.DNMT1-microRNA126 epigenetic circuit contributes to esophageal squamous cell carcinoma growth via ADAM9-EGFR-AKT signaling.Clin. Cancer Res. 2015; 21: 854-863Google Scholar), the second one did not find any alterations in phospho-EGFR or the downstream phospho-MAPK upon ADAM9 KD (44Zhou R. Cho W.C.S. Ma V. Cheuk W. So Y.K. Wong S.C.C. et al.ADAM9 mediates triple-negative breast cancer progression via AKT/NF-κB pathway.Front. Med. (Lausanne). 2020; 7: 214Google Scholar). To resolve this contradiction, we used HCT116 cells, in which Akt activity is insensitive to growth factor"
https://openalex.org/W4284673308,"Electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) is promising for accurately determining elemental components in micro-areas of individual phytolith particles, interpreting compositional features and formation mechanisms of phytoliths in plants, identifying archeological and sedimental phytolith. However, the EPMA method of analyzing mounted slide phytoliths has not well been defined. In this study, we attempted different EPMA methods to determine the elemental compositions of phytoliths in mounted slides. Direct analysis of carbon (DAC) with other elements in phytolith could obtain abnormally high total values and carbon values. The method of carbon excluded in measuring elements (non-carbon analysis (NCA)) was feasible to obtain elemental compositions in phytolith. The NCA method was conducive to obtain the factual elemental compositions of an individual phytolith (morphotype) when the carbon content of phytolith was relatively low. The EPMA results of phytoliths from 20 bamboo species (three genera) showed that phytolith was dominantly composed of SiO2 but also included low contents of diverse other elements. The EPMA of phytoliths can provide the elemental composition of micro-areas of an individual phytolith particle. The elemental compositions of phytolith varied with their morphotypes, the genera and ecotype of bamboos. The EPMA of elemental compositions in phytoliths is a potential tool to study the formation mechanism of phytoliths, plant taxonomical identification, archaeological and paleoenvironmental reconstruction."
https://openalex.org/W4284689294,"The mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) protein is an important growth regulator and has been linked with multiple diseases including cancer and diabetes. Non-synonymous mutations of this gene have already been found in patients with renal clear cell carcinoma, melanoma, and acute lymphoid leukemia among many others. Such mutations can potentially affect a protein's structure and hence its functions. In this study, therefore, the most deleterious SNPs of mTOR protein have been determined to identify potential biomarkers for various disease treatments. The aim is to generate a structured dataset of the mTOR gene's SNPs that may prove to be an asset for the identification and treatment of multiple diseases associated with the target gene. Both sequence and structure-based approaches were adopted and a wide variety of bioinformatics tools were applied to analyze the SNPs of mTOR protein. In total 11 nsSNPs have been filtered out of 2178 nsSNPs along with two non-coding variations. All of the nsSNPs were found to destabilize the protein structure and disrupt its function. While R619C, A1513D, and T1977R mutations were shown to alter C alpha distances and bond angles of the mTOR protein, L509Q, R619C and N2043S were predicted to disrupt the mTOR protein's interaction with NBS1 protein and FKBP1A/rapamycin complex. In addition, one of the non-coding SNPs was shown to alter miRNA binding sites. Characterizing nsSNPs and non-coding SNPs and their harmful effects on a protein's structure and functions will enable researchers to understand the critical impact of mutations on the molecular mechanisms of various diseases. This will ultimately lead to the identification of potential targets for disease diagnosis and therapeutic interventions."
https://openalex.org/W4284710280,"This paper offers a comprehensive analysis model for android malware. The model presents the essential factors affecting the analysis results of android malware that are vision-based. Current android malware analysis and solutions might consider one or some of these factors while building their malware predictive systems. However, this paper comprehensively highlights these factors and their impacts through a deep empirical study. The study comprises 22 CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) algorithms, 21 of them are well-known, and one proposed algorithm. Additionally, several types of files are considered before converting them to images, and two benchmark android malware datasets are utilized. Finally, comprehensive evaluation metrics are measured to assess the produced predictive models from the security and complexity perspectives. Consequently, guiding researchers and developers to plan and build efficient malware analysis systems that meet their requirements and resources. The results reveal that some factors might significantly impact the performance of the malware analysis solution. For example, from a security perspective, the accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall are improved by 131.29%, 236.44%, 192%, and 131.29%, respectively, when changing one factor and fixing all other factors under study. Similar results are observed in the case of complexity assessment, including testing time, CPU usage, storage size, and pre-processing speed, proving the importance of the proposed android malware analysis model."
https://openalex.org/W4283742583,"During spliceosome assembly, the 3′ splice site is recognized by sequential U2AF2 complexes, first with Splicing Factor 1 (SF1) and second by the SF3B1 subunit of the U2 small nuclear ribonuclear protein particle. The U2AF2–SF1 interface is well characterized, comprising a U2AF homology motif (UHM) of U2AF2 bound to a U2AF ligand motif (ULM) of SF1. However, the structure of the U2AF2–SF3B1 interface and its importance for pre-mRNA splicing are unknown. To address this knowledge gap, we determined the crystal structure of the U2AF2 UHM bound to a SF3B1 ULM site at 1.8-Å resolution. We discovered a distinctive trajectory of the SF3B1 ULM across the U2AF2 UHM surface, which differs from prior UHM/ULM structures and is expected to modulate the orientations of the full-length proteins. We established that the binding affinity of the U2AF2 UHM for the cocrystallized SF3B1 ULM rivals that of a nearly full-length U2AF2 protein for an N-terminal SF3B1 region. An additional SF3B6 subunit had no detectable effect on the U2AF2–SF3B1 binding affinities. We further showed that key residues at the U2AF2 UHM–SF3B1 ULM interface contribute to coimmunoprecipitation of the splicing factors. Moreover, disrupting the U2AF2–SF3B1 interface changed splicing of representative human transcripts. From analysis of genome-wide data, we found that many of the splice sites coregulated by U2AF2 and SF3B1 differ from those coregulated by U2AF2 and SF1.

The spliceosome assembles on consensus splice site signals of the pre-mRNA in a series of ATP-dependent conformational transitions (reviewed in (1Matera A.G. Wang Z. A day in the life of the spliceosome.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2014; 15: 108-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar)). In the initial ATP-independent E-complex, the essential pre-mRNA splicing factor U2AF2 recognizes a polypyrimidine (Py) tract preceding the 3′ splice site (2Zamore P.D. Green M.R.

In the subsequent A-complex, U2AF2 recruits the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (snRNP) of the spliceosome to the 3′ splice site. At this stage, the SF3B1 spliceosome subunit of the U2 snRNP replaces SF1 in the U2AF2 complex (9Gozani O. Potashkin J. Reed R.

A final conformational change to the B∗-complex allows the first catalytic reaction of pre-mRNA splicing to generate the branched intron lariat.This parts list of core spliceosome assemblies has been illuminated by recent cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of B, BACT, C, C∗, and intron-lariat spliceosomes (reviewed in (12Shi Y. Mechanistic insights into precursor messenger RNA splicing by the spliceosome.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2017; 18: 655-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar)). Nevertheless, cryo-EM approaches have yet to resolve the early stages of 3′ splice site recognition, which is challenging due to a fleeting “dance” of transitions among low-molecular-mass subunits. A cryo-EM structure of a 5′ splice site in the E-like yeast spliceosome assembly revealed weak density that could not be reliably modeled as the U2AF2 and SF1 homologues (Mud2 and BBP) (13Li X.

As such, the field’s structural understanding of U2AF2 and its partners remains limited to piecewise structures of the interacting domains.A C-terminal “U2AF Homology Motif” (UHM) domain of U2AF2 binds a well-characterized “U2AF Ligand Motif” (ULM) adjoining a coiled-coil region of SF1 (20Wang W.

However, the structure of the U2AF2–SF3B1 complex and its relevance for pre-mRNA splicing is unknown.Here, we determine the U2AF2 UHM–SF3B1 ULM5 crystal structure. The ULM5 ligand conformation diverges from prior UHM–ULM complexes, highlighting the importance of determining new structures in the UHM–ULM family. We find that the SF3B6 subunit has no detectable influence on the U2AF2–SF3B1 binding affinity. We demonstrate the functional importance of the U2AF2 UHM–SF3B1 ULM5 interface for association of these splicing factors and provide evidence for its functional contributions to splicing of pre-mRNA transcripts.ResultsSF3B1 ULM5 is a high-affinity binding site for U2AF2 that is independent of SF3B6Among the SF3B1 ULMs, we previously showed that the fifth ULM (ULM5) has the highest binding affinity for the U2AF2 UHM (23Thickman K.R.

Biol. 2006; 356: 664-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The SF3B1 ULM5 is next to the binding site for an SF3B6 subunit (also called p14a). Here, we investigated whether extending the SF3B1 region and adding the SF3B6 subunit would influence its binding affinity for U2AF2. In addition, we extended the boundaries of the U2AF2 construct to include the nearly full-length protein (U2AF212UL), except for an unstructured N-terminal region that binds U2AF1 (Fig. 1A). We characterized the interactions using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and the same conditions as our prior experiments (23Thickman K.R. Swenson M.C. Kabogo J.M. Gryczynski Z. Kielkopf C.L.

Biol. 2006; 356: 664-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) (Table S1 and Fig. S1). The apparent equilibrium binding affinities increased subtly for the lengthened protein constructs (Fig. 1B). Including the SF3B6 subunit had no significant effect on the association of SF3B1 with U2AF212UL, which is consistent with NMR evidence for distinct binding sites of SF3B1 for SF3B6 or the U2AF2 UHM (24Spadaccini R. Reidt U. Dybkov O. Will C. Frank R. Stier G. et al.Biochemical and NMR analyses of an SF3b155-p14-U2AF-RNA interaction network involved in branch point definition during pre-mRNA splicing.RNA. 2006; 12: 410-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).More notably, the apparent stoichiometry of the lengthened complex decreased to two U2AF212UL bound per SF3B1 ULM-containing region (Table S1), rather than three U2AF2 UHMs (23Thickman K.R. Swenson M.C. Kabogo J.M. Gryczynski Z. Kielkopf C.L.

Biol. 2006; 356: 664-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Most likely, the smaller size of the U2AF2 UHM than U2AF212UL left room for a third molecule to associate with the SF3B1 ULMs. We note that the ability of excess U2AF212UL to concurrently bind more than one of the SF3B1 ULMs did not necessarily reflect the stoichiometry in the context of the assembling spliceosome, which is thought to contain a single U2AF2 and U2 snRNP per splice site (29Chen L. Weinmeister R. Kralovicova J. Eperon L.P. Vorechovsky I. Hudson A.J. et al.Stoichiometries of U2AF35, U2AF65 and U2 snRNP reveal new early spliceosome assembly pathways.Nucl. Acids Res. 2017; 45: 2051-2067PubMed Google Scholar).We further compared the U2AF2 UHM binding affinities for SF3B1 ULM5 peptides with different boundaries. The SF3B1 peptides corresponding to the isolated ULM5 bound to U2AF2 with higher apparent affinity than the SF3B1 region containing all five ULMs, since this average apparent binding affinity included lower-affinity ULMs in addition to ULM5. Including a TP-motif, which is a phosphorylation site in human cells (30Beausoleil S.A. Jedrychowski M. Schwartz D. Elias J.E. Villen J.

These results defined a high-affinity ULM5 region (residues 333–351) for cocrystallization with the U2AF2 UHM.The SF3B1 ULM5 binds to the U2AF2 UHM in an atypical trajectoryTo view the U2AF2 UHM–SF3B1 ULM5 interactions, we determined the crystal structure at 1.80-Å resolution (Fig. 2A and Table S2). The crystallographic asymmetric unit contained two similar copies of the U2AF2 UHM–SF3B1 ULM5 complex (RMSD 1.4 Å for 113 matching Cα atoms) (Fig. S2, A and B). The electron density maps revealed 12 or 9 ordered residues for the noncrystallographic symmetry (NCS)-related copies of UHM-bound SF3B1 ULM5 (Fig. S2C). The additional ordered residues append a C-terminal α-helical turn (residues 344–346) that makes crystallographic and NCS-related contacts with neighboring UHMs. Otherwise, the two different copies in the crystallographic asymmetric unit of U2AF2 bound to SF3B1 ULM5 shared nearly identical conformations.Figure 2Structure of the U2AF2 UHM bound to SF3B1 ULM5 and comparison with related complexes.

Kielkopf C.L. Unmasking the U2AF homology motif family: A bona fide protein-protein interaction motif in disguise.RNA. 2016; 22: 1795-1807Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A), as compared for the RBM39 (also called CAPERα) UHM bound to SF3B1 ULM5 (27Loerch S. Maucuer A. Manceau V. Green M.R. Kielkopf C.L. Cancer-relevant splicing factor CAPERα engages the essential splicing factor SF3b155 in a specific ternary complex.J. Biol.

The W338 side chain was sandwiched in a T-type interaction between the F454 aromatic ring and an R452–E405 salt bridge. The R337 side chain further anchored the SF3B1 ULM5 by a distinct salt bridge with the U2AF2 UHM E397. In addition, disordered basic residues at the N terminus of the ULM5 were aligned for electrostatic attraction with the acidic UHM α-helix.Other than these core features of UHM–ULM family members, both of the SF3B1 ULM5 copies followed unusual linear trajectories, running nearly parallel to the acidic α-helixes of the U2AF2 UHMs (Figs. 2A and S2C). Apart from three additional residues that were resolved at the C terminus of one ULM5 copy (complex B in Figs. 2 and S2), the U2AF2-bound ULMs did not appear to be involved in crystal packing contacts (Fig. S2A). The extended conformation of the SF3B1 ULM5 backbone was similar between the two NCS-related copies of the U2AF2 complex (RMSD 0.1 Å between 6 matching Cα atoms or 0.7 Å between all 55 matching atoms of the core ULM motif, Fig. S2B).An SF3B1 TP-motif, which can be phosphorylated by cell-division kinases (30Beausoleil S.A.

By contrast, SF3B1 ULMs typically bind other UHMs in a U-shaped conformation with the TP-motif packed against an exposed aromatic side chain from the central “X” position of the UHM RXF motif (e.g., W489 of RBM39 in Fig. 2B). A lysine (K453) at the “X” position of the U2AF2 RXF motif replaces the characteristic aromatic residue of other UHMs, where it may influence the trajectory of the U2AF2-bound ULM.In the U2AF2 UHM complex with the SF1 factor that precedes SF3B1 during spliceosome assembly, the K453 residue of the U2AF2 RXF motif mediates a specific salt bridge with the SF1 ULM-coiled coil region (20Wang W. Maucuer A. Gupta A. Manceau V. Thickman K.R.

Acids Res. 2013; 41: 1343-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). SF1 lacks a TP-motif in the region following its ULM, which instead forms a disordered loop (Fig. 2C). The angle relative to the U2AF2 UHM α-helix is greater for the SF1 ULM polypeptide than for SF3B1 ULM. The distinct trajectory of the U2AF2-bound SF3B1 ULM5 appears to be anchored by a salt bridge between U2AF2 R452 and SF3B1 D339, which is replaced by an asparagine (N23) in the SF1 counterpart. Despite slightly different orientations, the extended backbone conformations of the U2AF2-bound SF1 and SF3B1 ULMs are similar (RMSD 0.5 Å between five matching Cα atoms of the SF1 ULM and SF3B1 ULM5). Like the U2AF2-bound SF3B1 ULM5 but distinct from other UHM–ULM complexes, the C-terminal residues of the SF1 ULM are located closer to R452 than to the central position of the RXF motif. This comparison suggests that contacts between the TP-motif of SF3B1 and the aromatic residue of other UHM RXF motifs contribute to the U-shaped ULM conformation, whereas the “RKF” of the U2AF2 UHM permits ULM ligands to adopt extended, near-linear conformations.Interface mutations reduce U2AF2 UHM–SF3B1 ULM5 binding affinityWe probed key residues at the U2AF2 UHM–SF3B1 ULM interface by ITC of structure-guided mutant proteins (Figs. 3, S1 and Table S1). The amino acid substitutions are unlikely to perturb the overall protein folds since we targeted residues at the UHM surface and the ULM region itself is unstructured (23Thickman K.R. Swenson M.C.

First, we tested the relevance of U2AF2 UHM contacts with the C-terminal residues of the SF3B1 ULM5, which were affected by crystal contacts in one of the two copies (Fig. S2A). Since SF3B1 T341 has an intramolecular contact that appears to position M346 of complex A, we investigated a T341A/M346A double mutant (Fig. 3C). We also tested a glycine substitution for P342 that is expected to confer a flexible backbone without a side chain, in contrast with the wildtype proline. The U2AF2 UHM binding affinities of the T341A/M346A and P342G SF3B1 ULM5 mutants were similar to those of the wildtype (WT) counterpart (Fig. 3D), consistent with the variable positions of these residues in the two crystallographically independent copies of the complex.Figure 3Contribution of interface residues to the U2AF2 UHM–SF3B1 ULM5 binding affinity.

As described above, this U2AF2 lysine differs from a typically aromatic side chain at the corresponding position of other UHMs and appeared to influence the bound ULM conformation (Fig. 2). The distinct trajectory of the U2AF2-bound ULM5 packed SF3B1 D339 against the hydrophobic portion of the U2AF2 K453 side chain (Fig. 3, A and B), which in turn positioned SF3B1 D339 to mediate a salt bridge with U2AF2 R452. Accordingly, replacing K453 with alanine reduced the binding affinity of the U2AF2 UHM–SF3B1 ULM5 complex by 4-fold (Fig. 3D and Table S1). This small, but statistically significant, change is consistent with loss of the observed D339–K453 contact and/or disruption of a weak ionic interaction between the side chains.Lastly, we examined interactions between the canonical acidic α-helix of the UHM and basic residues of the N-terminal ULM tail (Fig. 3, A and B). An E397K mutation reduced the U2AF2 binding affinity for SF3B1 ULM5 by approximately 100-fold, consistent with disruption of an U2AF2 E397–SF3B1 R337 salt bridge that is present in both copies of the complex in the crystallographic asymmetric unit. A U2AF2 E394K mutation also penalized SF3B1 ULM5 binding, although to a lesser extent (by approximately 20-fold) in agreement with loss of an alternative E394–R337 salt bridge. Substituting lysines for both U2AF2 E394/E397 residues abolished detectable binding to the SF3B1 ULM5 (Fig. 3D and Table S1). The additive effect of the two mutations is expected to decrease the apparent dissociation constant (KD) approximately 100 μM. Although this value would exceed the limit for a reliable isotherm fit, the absence of any detectable heats for SF3B1 binding to the double U2AF2 mutant suggested that the E394/E397 interactions synergize to some extent. The undetectable E394K/E397K U2AF2 binding to SF3B1 ULM5, coupled with our prior observations that the central ULM tryptophan is required for detectable association of the purified U2AF2 UHM with SF3B1 proteins (23Thickman K.R.

The N-terminally tagged constructs for U2AF2 (HA-tag, HAU2AF2) and SF3B1 (FLAG-tag, FLAGSF3B1) were transiently coexpressed in HEK 293T cells. The HAU2AF2-associated protein complexes were immunoprecipitated using anti-HA agarose beads. We found that wildtype FLAGSF3B1 efficiently associated with HAU2AF2 (Fig. 4B). The HAU2AF2 E394K/E397K mutation abolished detectable coimmunoprecipitation of FLAGSF3B1, consistent with the ability of this mutation to disrupt U2AF2 UHM binding to the SF3B1 ULM-containing region in ITC experiments.Figure 4The U2AF2 UHM contributes to association with SF3B1 in human cell extracts.

Abnormal molecular, motor, and neurophysiological phenotypes in SCA2 mouse models are normalized by lowering ATXN2 transcription, and reduction of nonmutant Atxn2 expression has been shown to increase the life span of mice overexpressing the TDP-43 (transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 kDa) ALS protein, demonstrating the potential benefits of targeting ATXN2 transcription in humans. Here, we describe a quantitative high-throughput screen to identify compounds that lower ATXN2 transcription. We screened 428,759 compounds in a multiplexed assay using an ATXN2-luciferase reporter in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK-293) cells and identified a diverse set of compounds capable of lowering ATXN2 transcription. We observed dose-dependent reductions of endogenous ATXN2 in HEK-293 cells treated with procillaridin A, 17-dimethylaminoethylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-DMAG), and heat shock protein 990 (HSP990), known inhibitors of HSP90 and Na+/K+-ATPases. Furthermore, HEK-293 cells expressing polyglutamine-expanded ATXN2-Q58 treated with 17-DMAG had minimally detectable ATXN2, as well as normalized markers of autophagy and endoplasmic reticulum stress, including STAU1 (Staufen 1), molecular target of rapamycin, p62, LC3-II (microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3II), CHOP (C/EBP homologous protein), and phospho-eIF2α (eukaryotic initiation factor 2α). Finally, bacterial artificial chromosome ATXN2-Q22 mice treated with 17-DMAG or HSP990 exhibited highly reduced ATXN2 protein abundance in the cerebellum. Taken together, our study demonstrates inhibition of HSP90 or Na+/K+-ATPases as potentially effective therapeutic strategies for treating SCA2 and ALS."

Individual AP-1 proteins possess leucine zipper regions for dimerization and basic regions for DNA binding, a motif defining all bZIP proteins (2Glover J.N. Harrison S.C.

The archetypal and most well-studied AP-1 complex is the cFos:cJun heterodimer, which binds and activates transcription at the 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate response element (TRE), with a 7 bp consensus sequence TGA[C/G]TCA (3Halazonetis T.D.

These AP-1 binding sites have been largely deselected from the mammalian genome, particularly in coding regions, whereas AP-1 controlled promoters often contain more than one copy of the TRE site (20Zhou H.

Lefrancois M. Tremblay M. Saint-Denis M. Haman A. Waga K. et al.c-Jun homodimers can function as a context-specific coactivator.Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 27: 2919-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The status of cFos as an independent DNA-binding protein is disputed. Several previous studies have suggested that cFos is incapable of homodimerization and DNA binding due to poor interaction dynamics within the leucine zipper, which comprises a number of Thr/Lys residues within the core region typically comprised of hydrophobic residues (3Halazonetis T.D. Georgopoulos K. Greenberg M.E.

A. 2006; 103: 8989-8994Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). While isolated cFos leucine zippers have displayed a low affinity/unstable interaction (24O’Shea E.K. Rutkowski R. Stafford W.F. Kim P.S. Preferential heterodimer formation by isolated leucine zippers from fos and jun.Science. 1989; 245: 646-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar), cFos has been defined as a DNA-binding protein and transcription factor only in the presence of cJun (25Smeal T. Angel P. Meek J. Karin M. Different requirements for formation of Jun: Jun and Jun: Fos complexes.Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 2091-2100Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). However, Kohler & Schepartz (26Kohler J.J. Schepartz A. Kinetic studies of Fos.Jun.DNA complex formation: DNA binding prior to dimerization.Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 130-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) determined through a bulk phase kinetic study that prebinding of cJun and cFos to the DNA before dimerization was the preferred mechanism of AP-1 formation, implying that cFos binds DNA independently. Limited in vivo evidence also suggests the existence of cFos homodimers (27Szalóki N. Krieger J.W. Komáromi I. Tóth K. Vámosi G. Evidence for homodimerization of the c-fos transcription factor in live cells revealed by fluorescence microscopy and computer modeling.Mol. Cell Biol. 2015; 35: 3785-3798Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, there is still no clear evidence to support the DNA-binding activity of a cFos homodimer. We have performed a comprehensive study of the nature and prevalence of the DNA bound forms of cJun and cFos. By fluorescently tagging the bZIP domains of the AP-1 proteins cJun and cFos with different colors and visualizing their interactions on DNA tightropes (single DNA molecules suspended between surface pedestals) at the single molecule level, we found cJun primarily formed homodimers and was able to heterodimerize with cFos as expected. Unexpectedly, however, cFos was found to bind, as a mixture of monomers and dimers, to DNA tightropes in the absence of cJun, which was confirmed using bulk phase circular dichroism (CD) studies. cFos dimerization was further observed in a Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay using fluorescent protein fusions in which either half of the homodimer population was uniquely tagged. Altogether, these observations provide compelling evidence that cFos has a cJun-independent interaction with DNA. To study the DNA binding and search mechanisms of AP-1 proteins, we used chemically synthesized peptides of the bZIP regions of cJun and cFos. These were modified with a c-terminal biotin tag to allow conjugation with streptavidin-coated Qdots which provide bright and photostable fluorescence emission. Single DNA molecules suspended between surface-immobilized beads (DNA tightropes—Fig. 1A) were used as an imaging substrate. This architecture enables high signal to noise imaging with the molecules suspended microns above the surface and therefore free of surface-induced artifacts such as binding to the coverslip surface (28Springall L. Inchingolo A.V. Kad N.M. DNA–Protein interactions studied directly using single molecule fluorescence imaging of quantum dot tagged proteins moving on DNA tightropes.Methods Mol. Biol. 2016; 1431: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). We used single color– or dual color–labeled cJun or cFos in these experiments, and the proteins were not mixed together in this work as we investigate homodimerization only. The images in Figure 1, B and D show examples of dual-colored homodimers bound to DNA. These molecules diffused on the DNA in a random walk (see supporting videos), to represent that motion we used kymographs (Fig. 1, C and E), which are projections of each position (y-axis) over time (x-axis). From the images in Figure 1, D and E, it is clear that cFos binds to DNA independently of cJun. Using dual color labeling, we investigated the oligomeric state of cFos when bound to DNA. Equimolar Qdot 655 and Qdot 605 were mixed prior to cFos conjugation to allow an equal probability of a protein binding to either colored Qdot. Whenever molecules dimerize, the color combinations include dimers formed from only 605-labeled cFos, only 655-labeled cFos, and dual-colored cFos (there are two ways dual-colored complexes are formed; therefore, the probability of these forming is twice that of the singly colored entities, see Fig. 2A). Due to this, the quantity of dual-colored molecules always underestimates the total number of dimers by 50%. As a consequence, if 100% of molecules dimerized, only 50% of the observed bound molecules would be dual colored. In the case of cFos, we observed 15% ± 1.9 dual-colored entities bound to DNA, indicating that ∼30% of all DNA-bound molecules had dimerized. To ensure that this was not an artefact of labeling, we also studied the occurrence of dual color signals for cJun and found 47% ± 1.3 were dual colored, consistent with nearly complete homodimer formation (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, this also indicated that labeling was efficient, since lower efficiency would lead to overrepresentation of singly colored species. The surprising result that cFos binds as a monomer was tested using Qdot blinking. Due to the photophysical properties of Qdots, it is not possible to relate their intensity to the number of Qdots present (29Kuno M. Fromm D.P. Hamann H.F. Gallagher A. Nesbitt D.J. Nonexponential ""blinking"" kinetics of single CdSe quantum dots: A universal power law behavior.J. Chem. Phys. 2000; 112: 3117-3120Crossref Google Scholar). Therefore, an alternative method to determine oligomeric states was devised based on the blinking of the attached Qdots. The analysis is simple: the chance of a molecule dropping to a completely dark state will be reduced if there are two Qdots present, since the probability of blinking at the same time is the square of that from a single Qdot, resulting in ‘fluorescence redundancy’. The number of blink events was calculated from 50 kymographs (using Qdot 655 conjugates only) and displayed as a histogram (Fig. 2B). Fifty-eight percent of cJun kymographs exhibited between 0 and 4 blinks, compared to 20% for cFos. The histogram also displays a prominent peak between 9 and 12 blinks for cFos but a much smaller peak for cJun. This implies the presence of two cFos populations: dimers with few blinks and monomers with a greater number of blinks. A simple Poisson distribution for a single, monomeric species would not reproduce the data; therefore the data in Figure 2B were fitted to a dual Poisson model for stochastic blinking. This model assumes that the probability of blinking for dimers is the square of that for monomers. Therefore, only the monomer blinking probability and the amplitude of the monomer population is fitted (see methods); both cJun and cFos were simultaneously fitted, reducing the degrees of freedom. The excellent fit to the data (lines in Fig. 2B) validates the model choice, and the amplitudes for the two populations reveal remarkable similarity to that from the dual color experiment; 46% of cFos molecules were dimers compared to 87% for cJun. The use of FRET to detect AP-1 interactions is well established but has been primarily used to study cFos:cJun complexes (26Kohler J.J. Schepartz A.

The use of Qdots was ideal for single molecule measurements, but their use in FRET is complicated by surface conjugations and their broad excitation spectra. Therefore, we investigated cJun and cFos homodimerization in solution by exploiting the established FRET pair (32McCullock T.W. MacLean D.M. Kammermeier P.J. Comparing the performance of mScarlet-I, mRuby3, and mCherry as FRET acceptors for mNeonGreen.PLoS One. 2020; 15e0219886Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) mNeonGreen (mNG) and mCherry (mCH) fused to cJun or cFos (cJun-mNG, cJun-mCH, cFos-mNG, and cFos-mCH) in a 96-well plate-based fluorescence assay. We generated excitation spectra detecting mCherry emission at 700 nM across an excitation range from 450 to 650 nm. This approach provides an excellent means to detect FRET without bleed-through complications. For cJun (Fig. 3A), a clear mNG contribution to the fluorescence at 700 nm is seen. When subtracted from the sum of the individual cJun-mNG and cJun-mCH spectra, a very clear excitation peak for mNG was seen, as predicted when the two fluorophores are coupled due to dimerization (Fig. 3B). By comparison, cFos did not have a significant peak at the excitation of mNG (Fig. 3C), and the difference spectra (Fig. 3D) revealed an increase in fluorescence at 590 nm, consistent with the excitation of mCH only. These FRET data clearly indicate that a cJun homodimer is forming, and that in the presence of DNA, a conformational change in the homodimer leads to a small increase in mCH excitation. For cFos, the situation is more complex, and the difference spectra show a small contribution from mNG, indicating FRET is occurring for this dimer, though significantly less than for cJun. However, a clear enhancement of fluorescence at 590 nm is present only in the paired combination relative to the sum of their individual spectra, indicating that the change in mCH excitation is only present when cFos-mNG and cFos-mCH are combined in vitro. Therefore, these data indicate that cFos forms dimers both with and without DNA present. A more detailed explanation of the FRET spectral analysis is included in the Figs. S1–S9. Fig. S10 shows that noninteracting protein fusions (cFos-mCH and UvrA-mNG) do not elicit energy transfer effects indicating that the effects seen for cFos homodimers are significant and specific. To provide an orthogonal approach to our fluorescence observations, we measured the binding-induced structural changes of short oligonucleotides using CD (33Gray D.M. Circular dichroism of protein-nucleic acid interactions.in: Fasman G.D. Circular Dichroism and the Conformational Analysis of Biomolecules. Springer, Boston, MA1996Crossref Google Scholar). Synthesized AP-1 peptides have previously been explored by Mason et al. (16Mason J.M. Schmitz M.A. Müller K.M. Arndt K.M. Semirational design of Jun-Fos coiled coils with increased affinity: universal implications for leucine zipper prediction and design.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 8989-8994Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and show similar spectra to the biotinylated peptides used in this study. Each component was measured individually, and the sum of the spectra predicts the spectrum for the mixture in the absence of any interaction. The differences observed between the summed spectrum and the measured protein/DNA mixture spectrum provide information on binding (34Brennan A. Leech J.T. Kad N.M. Mason J.M. Approach to derive functional peptide inhibitors of transcription factor activity.JACS Au. 2022; 2: 996-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Upon addition of 10-fold excess of cFos or cJun to TRE DNA (Fig. 4, A and B), the amplitude of the peak centered on 281 nm is altered. This indicates binding and reflects changes in the DNA component. Addition of cFos increases the amplitude, whereas cJun decreases it, perhaps indicating different binding modes but clearly showing a change in DNA structure upon protein binding in both cases. As a control, a non-TRE–containing oligonucleotide was used, and no change relative to the summed amplitude was observed (Fig. 4, C and D). These data indicate clear and specific binding to the TRE consensus sequence. AP-1 proteins form an array of potential interactors multiplying their possible effects through dimerization. cFos is known to form a heterodimer with cJun and initiate transcription of an array of genes, many of which are oncogenes. However, the role of cFos alone as an entity capable of interacting with DNA has not been considered significant. This stems from a number of studies which have failed to show any dimer formation. However, one study has suggested that cFos can dimerize in vivo (27Szalóki N. Krieger J.W. Komáromi I. Tóth K. Vámosi G. Evidence for homodimerization of the c-fos transcription factor in live cells revealed by fluorescence microscopy and computer modeling.Mol. Cell Biol. 2015; 35: 3785-3798Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), but in vitro support for this view is limited. By using a single molecule imaging approach supported by bulk phase FRET and CD observations, we have determined that cFos associates with DNA both as monomers and dimers. Using cJun, which has a known propensity to homodimerize as a control, we find the equilibrium towards monomer is favored for cFos, and only 30 to 46% of molecules observed on DNA were dimeric. These observations imply that cFos possesses DNA binding activity in the absence of cJun, which could potentially have cellular significance. Given the protooncogenic role of cJun:cFos, this presents an important new area of research for this protein. In this study, it was imperative to provide a number of approaches to show cFos binds to DNA. We firstly used single molecule imaging of dual-colored complexes. This showed ∼30% of cFos molecules form dimers on DNA compared to 94% for cJun. Importantly, dual-colored cFos was observed to undertake a random walk on DNA, since both colors followed the same path, this provides very strong evidence that their colocalization occurred through complex formation. Numerous proteins undergo random walks when bound to DNA, and this has been suggested to underpin the faster than diffusion target location for proteins such as LacI (35Riggs A.D. Bourgeois S. Cohn M. The lac repressor-operator interaction. 3. Kinetic studies.J. Mol. Biol. 1970; 53: 401-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar, 36von Hippel P.H. Berg O.G. Facilitated target location in biological systems.J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 675-678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that cFos and cJun use one-dimensional diffusion for target site location, and we are currently investigating this possibility. However, to provide additional evidence for homodimer formation, we also measured the frequency of blinking. In these experiments, two molecules are unlikely to blink at the same time so the number of blinks to background should reduce when dimerized. A similar approach has been employed to study the formation of oligomeric complexes on cell surfaces (37Fricke F. Beaudouin J. Eils R. Heilemann M. One, two or three? Probing the stoichiometry of membrane proteins by single-molecule localization microscopy.Sci. Rep. 2015; 514072Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Our approach differs in the statistics we use, since we are measuring blinks for a specific interval, a Poisson rather than binomial distribution is more appropriate. From this analysis, we were able to show that two populations of blink frequency existed, corresponding to monomers and dimers, with a homodimer occurrence of 46% for cFos and 87% cJun. This compared well to the dual-color imaging; however, to fully confirm the mixed oligomeric nature of cFos when bound to DNA, we also engineered fluorescent protein fusions with cFos and cJun to analyze FRET activity. A clear FRET signal was observed for cJun, whereas a small increase at the acceptor wavelength was seen for cFos. This suggests that upon homodimerization, the dual-labeled cFos complex affects the quantum yield of the acceptor, which is reduced slightly upon binding DNA. Taken together, these experiments strongly imply that cFos forms a homodimer on DNA in both bulk and single molecule assays. The lower proportion of cFos homodimers may facilitate easier partner swapping with cJun, reducing the energy barrier required for dissociation and reassociation, implying that cFos has evolved to be poorly homodimeric. These results contrast with previous studies that suggest cFos is limited in its ability to homodimerize (16Mason J.M. Schmitz M.A. Müller K.M. Arndt K.M. Semirational design of Jun-Fos coiled coils with increased affinity: universal implications for leucine zipper prediction and design.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Truncated and helix-constrained peptides with high affinity and specificity for the cFos coiled-coil of AP-1.PLoS One. 2013; 8e59415Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and cannot appreciably bind DNA without a partner, e.g., cJun (3Halazonetis T.D. Georgopoulos K. Greenberg M.E. Leder P. c-Jun dimerizes with itself and with c-Fos, forming complexes of different DNA binding affinities.Cell. 1988; 55: 917-924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). This discrepancy may be due to differing methodologies, for example electrophoretic mobility shift assays may release bound protein due to hydrodynamic forces in the gel’s mesh. Traditional methods such as electrophoretic mobility shift assays, isothermal calorimetry, and size exclusion chromatography typically use high concentrations of protein which may reduce the precision of observations. Our single molecule approaches use a substrate with a large number of binding sites, both cognate and noncognate (17Seldeen K.L. McDonald C.B. Deegan B.J. Farooq A. Single nucleotide variants of the TGACTCA motif modulate energetics and orientation of binding of the Jun-Fos heterodimeric transcription factor.Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 1975-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Such a large number of target sites may increase the probability of detecting a binding event. Studying the binding of cFos to SNP variants of the TRE site would be worthwhile for future studies, as cFos may prefer a different site to the cognate TRE; this has already been performed for the cFos:cJun heterodimer (17Seldeen K.L.

https://openalex.org/W4284663676,"Tuberculosis (TB) is a contagious disease and its transmissibility is increased in congregate settings. TB incidence rates are five-to-fifty times higher among inmates in prison settings than the general population which has a direct impact on the outcome of TB treatment. There is paucity of information on TB treatment outcomes and its associated factors in Nigerian prison settings. We therefore assessed TB treatment outcomes among inmates in prison settings in Bauchi State, Nigeria. We conducted a retrospective data analysis of inmates with TB in the five-main prison settings in Bauchi State. We extracted socio-demographic, clinical and treatment outcome characteristics from TB treatment register of inmates treated for TB between January 2014 and December 2018, using a checklist. We calculated the TB treatment success rate (TSR) and explored the relationship between the TSR and socio-demographic and clinical characteristics. Related variables were modelled in multiple logistic regression to identify factors associated with TSR at 5% level of significance. All 216 inmates were male with mean (SD) age of 37.6±11.4 years. Seventy-six (35.2%) were cured, 61 (28.2%) completed treatment, 65 (30.1%) were transferred-out without evaluation and 14 (6.5%) died. Overall TSR was 72.9%. Factors associated with successful-treatment-outcome were age, weight, imprisonment duration and HIV status. The results indicate that inmates who are 20–29 years are at least ten times more likely to be successful (aOR = 10.5; 95%CI: 3.2–35.1) than inmates who are 55 years or older. Inmates who are 30–39 years are about four times more likely to be successful than inmates who are 55 years or older (aOR = 4.2; 95% CI: 1.3–13.1). In general, the younger an inmate, the more successful he is. Inmates with pretreatment-weight; 55kg or more are 13 times more likely to be successful (aOR = 13.3; 95%CI: 6.0–29.6) than inmates with weight below 55kg. Inmates who were imprisoned for 2 years or less are about three times more likely to be successful (aOR = 2.6; 95%CI: 1.3–5.4) than inmates who were imprisoned for more than 2 years and HIV negative inmates were three times more likely to succeed (aOR = 3.3; 95%CI:1.4–7.8) than inmates who were HIV positive. We recommended that to improve TB treatment outcome among inmates; age, duration-of-imprisonment, weight and TB/HIV co-infection should be the major consideration during pretreatment, psychological and nutritional counselling and a tracking-system be developed by the authority to follow-up inmates transferred-out to other health facilities to ensure they complete the treatment and outcomes evaluated."

https://openalex.org/W4284691550,"Laryngeal paralysis is a well-documented cause of upper respiratory tract obstruction in canines. Diagnosis of laryngeal paralysis is usually made by visual evaluation of laryngeal motion whilst patients are under a light-plane of anesthesia. However, in human studies of laryngeal function evaluation, it has been shown that subjective scoring can lead to significant interobserver variance, which may cause false diagnosis. In this study, we propose to introduce a more objective method of assessing laryngeal function using GlotAnTools and Tracker software to directly measure laryngeal motion in anaesthetized patients. Additionally, two anesthetic agents, alfaxalone and propofol, were compared in this study to assess their relative effect on laryngeal motion and thus their suitability for use in this diagnostic process. This study was a two-stage, cross-over, 1:1 randomization, with two active treatment arms. Ten beagles (10-18 months, five males and five females) were exposed to both anesthetic agents and laryngeal motion was recorded using videoendoscopy. GlotAnTools and Tracker software were applied to the recorded images to measure glottal gap area (A) and length (L). A normalized measure of laryngeal function-computed as A/L-was created, representing the ""elongatedness"" of the rima glottidis. The glottal gap area was significantly reduced in dogs receiving alfaxalone. This study objectively establishes that alfaxalone impacted laryngeal motion significantly more than propofol and confirms the capability of these computational methods to detect differences in laryngeal motion."
https://openalex.org/W4284694641,"In the clinical fitting of cochlear implants (CIs), the lowest input acoustic frequency is typically much lower than the characteristic frequency associated with the most apical electrode position, due to the limited electrode insertion depth. For bilateral CI users, electrode positions may differ across ears. However, the same acoustic-to-electrode frequency allocation table (FAT) is typically assigned to both ears. As such, bilateral CI users may experience both intra-aural frequency mismatch within each ear and inter-aural mismatch across ears. This inter-aural mismatch may limit the ability of bilateral CI users to take advantage of spatial cues when attempting to segregate competing speech. Adjusting the FAT to tonotopically match the electrode position in each ear (i.e., increasing the low acoustic input frequency) is theorized to reduce this inter-aural mismatch. Unfortunately, this approach may also introduce the loss of acoustic information below the modified input acoustic frequency. The present study explored the trade-off between reduced inter-aural frequency mismatch and low-frequency information loss for segregation of competing speech. Normal-hearing participants were tested while listening to acoustic simulations of bilateral CIs. Speech reception thresholds (SRTs) were measured for target sentences produced by a male talker in the presence of two different male talkers. Masker speech was either co-located with or spatially separated from the target speech. The bilateral CI simulations were produced by 16-channel sinewave vocoders; the simulated insertion depth was fixed in one ear and varied in the other ear, resulting in an inter-aural mismatch of 0, 2, or 6 mm in terms of cochlear place. Two FAT conditions were compared: 1) clinical (200-8000 Hz in both ears), or 2) matched to the simulated insertion depth in each ear. Results showed that SRTs were significantly lower with the matched than with the clinical FAT, regardless of the insertion depth or spatial configuration of the masker speech. The largest improvement in SRTs with the matched FAT was observed when the inter-aural mismatch was largest (6 mm). These results suggest that minimizing inter-aural mismatch with tonotopically matched FATs may benefit bilateral CI users' ability to segregate competing speech despite substantial low-frequency information loss in ears with shallow insertion depths."
https://openalex.org/W4284712038,"Blood Brain Barrier (BBB) breakdown is a secondary form of brain injury which has yet to be fully elucidated mechanistically. Existing research suggests that breakdown of tight junction proteins between endothelial cells is a primary driver of increased BBB permeability following injury, and intercellular signaling between primary cells of the neurovascular unit: endothelial cells, astrocytes, and pericytes; contribute to tight junction restoration. To expound upon this body of research, we analyzed the effects of severely injured patient plasma on each of the cell types in monoculture and together in a triculture model for the transcriptional and translational expression of the tight junction proteins Claudins 3 and 5, (CLDN3, CLDN5) and Zona Occludens 1 (ZO-1). Conditioned media transfer studies were performed to illuminate the cell type responsible for differential tight junction expression. Our data show that incubation with 5% human ex vivo severely injured patient plasma is sufficient to produce a differential response in endothelial cell tight junction mRNA and protein expression. Endothelial cells in monoculture produced a significant increase of CLDN3 and CLDN5 mRNA expression, (3.98 and 3.51 fold increase vs. control respectively, p<0.01) and CLDN5 protein expression, (2.58 fold change vs. control, p<0.01), whereas in triculture, this increase was attenuated. Our triculture model and conditioned media experiments suggest that conditioned media from astrocytes and pericytes and a triculture of astrocytes, pericytes and endothelial cells are sufficient in attenuating the transcriptional increases of tight junction proteins CLDN3 and CLDN5 observed in endothelial monocultures following incubation with severely injured trauma plasma. This data suggests that inhibitory molecular signals from astrocytes and pericytes contributes to prolonged BBB breakdown following injury via tight junction transcriptional and translational downregulation of CLDN5."
https://openalex.org/W4283734815,"Microaerophilic pathogens such as Giardia lamblia, Entamoeba histolytica, and Trichomonas vaginalis have robust oxygen consumption systems to detoxify oxygen and maintain intracellular redox balance. This oxygen consumption results from H2O-forming NADH oxidase (NOX) activity of two distinct flavin-containing systems: H2O-forming NOXes and multicomponent flavodiiron proteins (FDPs). Neither system is membrane bound, and both recycle NADH into oxidized NAD+ while simultaneously removing O2 from the local environment. However, little is known about the specific contributions of these systems in T. vaginalis. In this study, we use bioinformatics and biochemical analyses to show that T. vaginalis lacks a NOX–like enzyme and instead harbors three paralogous genes (FDPF1–3), each encoding a natural fusion product between the N-terminal FDP, central rubredoxin (Rb), and C-terminal NADH:Rb oxidoreductase domains. Unlike a “stand-alone” FDP that lacks Rb and oxidoreductase domains, this natural fusion protein with fully populated flavin redox centers directly accepts reducing equivalents of NADH to catalyze the four-electron reduction of oxygen to water within a single polypeptide with an extremely high turnover. Furthermore, using single-particle cryo-EM, we present structural insights into the spatial organization of the FDP core within this multidomain fusion protein. Together, these results contribute to our understanding of systems that allow protozoan parasites to maintain optimal redox balance and survive transient exposure to oxic conditions.

Together, these results contribute to our understanding of systems that allow protozoan parasites to maintain optimal redox balance and survive transient exposure to oxic conditions. Trichomonas vaginalis is a microaerophilic human protozoan parasite that causes trichomoniasis, one of the most common sexually transmitted infections (1Hodges A.L. Holland A.C.

A distinct feature of T. vaginalis as well as other human protozoan parasites such as Giardia lamblia (syn. intestinalis, duodenalis) and Entamoeba histolytica is their ability to tolerate low oxygen concentrations and transient exposure to oxic conditions. This is remarkable as these protozoa depend on metabolic enzymes that are extremely sensitive to oxygen, such as pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase and FeFe-hydrogenase (3Leitsch D. Williams C.F.

Another common feature of these single-celled eukaryotic organisms is that they do not contain traditional mitochondria and instead harbor mitochondria-derived organelles called mitosomes or hydrogenosomes that lack a membrane-bound electron transport chain (ETC) to carry out oxidative phosphorylation (4Muller M.

At the same time, it is well recognized that T. vaginalis consumes oxygen and that this oxygen consumption is insensitive to ETC inhibitors (such as cyanide or azide) (4Muller M.

Over the years, most of this oxygen consumption was attributed to enzymes that catalyze a conversion of diatomic oxygen to two benign water molecules at the expense of reducing equivalents of NAD(P)H (the H2O-forming NAD(P)H oxidase reaction) (Fig. 1A). This reaction not only serves the “oxygen scrubbing” role, but at the same time, it maintains uninterrupted supply of oxidized NAD+ to support an optimal intracellular NADH/NAD+ ratio (4Muller M.

Within a monomer, the distance between the oxygen-binding diiron center and the FMN plane is approximately 40 Å in all reported structures of FDPs, much greater than the ∼15 Å maximum distance that allows efficient electron transfer (ET) (19Page C.C.

As such, the functional unit of a “stand-alone” FDPA is comprised of a “head-to-tail” homodimer that positions the diiron center of one protomer adjacent to the FMN bound of its neighboring protomer (16Vicente J.B.

Another major difference between NOX and FDP enzymes is that the latter cannot directly receive electrons from NAD(P)H and requires additional protein adaptors as substrates. At the same time, FDPs can directly receive electrons from rubredoxin (Rb), a ∼6 kDa protein that contains an Fe(SCys)4 center and which in bacteria and Archaea is reduced by a dedicated NAD(P)H:Rb oxidoreductase (NROR) or similar systems (4Muller M.

Recent bioinformatics analysis revealed that in many organisms, FDPs are naturally fused to various redox partners and led to the current classification of this large group of proteins (26Folgosa F.

Teixeira M. The role of the flavodiiron proteins in microbial nitric oxide detoxification.Adv. Microb. Physiol. 2004; 49: 77-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). According to this classification “stand-alone” FDPs that contain only diiron and FMN centers are designated as FDPAs (26Folgosa F. Martins M.C. Teixeira M. Diversity and complexity of flavodiiron NO/O2 reductases.FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2018; 365https://doi.org/10.1093/femsle/fnx267Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). Several additional classes were proposed for proteins in which one or more other domains are fused genetically to the C-terminal side of the FDP core (classes B to H) (26Folgosa F. Martins M.C.

These additional redox centers may play crucial roles in dedicated ET pathways, through which reducing equivalents of NAD(P)H or other substrates are relayed to the gas-binding diiron site (26Folgosa F. Martins M.C. Teixeira M. Diversity and complexity of flavodiiron NO/O2 reductases.FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2018; 365https://doi.org/10.1093/femsle/fnx267Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We turned our attention to the water-forming oxidase activity ascribed to T. vaginalis because our laboratory is interested in oxygen-metabolizing systems that allow unicellular organisms that lack an ETC to maintain an optimal redox environment (12Titov D.V.

Complementation of mitochondrial electron transport chain by manipulation of the NAD+/NADH ratio.Science. 2016; 352: 231-235Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). While T. vaginalis as well G. lamblia and E. histolytica contain biochemically verified class A FDPs (FDPAs), there is still confusion in the literature about a NOX-like enzyme in this organism (20Di Matteo A. Scandurra F.M. Testa F. Forte E. Sarti P. Brunori M. et al.The O2-scavenging flavodiiron protein in the human parasite Giardia intestinalis.J. Biol.

The first attempt to purify the H2O-forming NOX activity from T. vaginalis resulted in an isolate that was active only with NADH (no activity with NADPH was detected) with a specific activity of 16.5 μmol min−1 mg−1 and Km for NADH of 7.4 μM (31Tanabe M. Trichomonas vaginalis: NADH oxidase activity.Exp. Parasitol. 1979; 48: 135-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The authors reported that the preparation consumed NADH and O2 with 2:1 stoichiometry and did not produce H2O2 as a byproduct. Unfortunately, neither the N-terminal sequence nor the molecular mass of the enzyme was reported at that time. In a later study, a H2O-forming NOX activity from T. vaginalis was purified and exhibited a kcat of 470 s−1 and Km for NADH of 5.4 μM (32Linstead D.J. Bradley S. The purification and properties of two soluble reduced nicotinamide: acceptor oxidoreductases from Trichomonas vaginalis.Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1988; 27: 125-133Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, in that study, when the H2O-forming NOX preparation was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, it migrated as two closely spaced unusually high molecular mass bands of 97 to 97.5 kDa. The latter observation was inconsistent with a NOX protein, which is usually ∼50 kDa (see previous one) (31Tanabe M. Trichomonas vaginalis: NADH oxidase activity.Exp.

In this study, using bioinformatics analysis, we show that the genome of T. vaginalis does not possess a typical tDBDF superfamily nox gene but instead harbors three genes that encode a natural fusion between flavodiiron, Rb, and NROR domains (class F FDP [FDPF] according to the new classification) (Fig. 2B) (26Folgosa F. Martins M.C. Teixeira M. Diversity and complexity of flavodiiron NO/O2 reductases.FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2018; 365https://doi.org/10.1093/femsle/fnx267Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We provide initial biochemical characterization of these three recombinant FDPFs from T. vaginalis (TvFDPF1–3). Furthermore, we focus our biochemical and biophysical characterization on TvFDPF3, as it is the most active and well-behaved enzyme. Together, our results demonstrate that natural fusion protein TvFDPF3 allows the crosstalk of all three domains, ultimately relaying electrons from NADH to O2. We also employ single-particle cryo-EM to visualize the dimerization interface of TvFDPF3. Our observations suggest that the enzymatic activity described by Tanabe in 1979 and by Bradley and Linstead in 1988 was misassigned as a NOX-like enzyme and that it is in fact an FDPF. Together, our biochemical, spectroscopic, and structural studies provide important new insights into how the FDPF system from T. vaginalis achieves extremely efficient H2O-forming oxidase activity using four separate redox centers. Because we were interested in evolutionary innovations that allow lower organisms that lack a membrane-bound ETC to maintain an optimal intracellular redox environment, we explored NOXes ascribed to human protozoan parasites (4Muller M. Mentel M. van Hellemond J.J. Henze K. Woehle C. Gould S.B. et al.Biochemistry and evolution of anaerobic energy metabolism in eukaryotes.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2012; 76: 444-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). While we easily identified previously characterized NOX in the genome of G. lamblia (33Brown D.M. Upcroft J.A. Upcroft P.

Biophys. 2009; 488: 9-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), the closest matches in the genome of T. vaginalis were three proteins, all of which were 871 amino acids in length and annotated in the EuPathDB database for human protozoan parasites as “pyridine nucleotide–disulfide oxidoreductase” or “apoptosis-inducing factor” (TVAG_263800, TVAG_049830, and TVAG_121610) (Table S1). We noticed that each of these three proteins is a fusion containing an N-terminal FDP domain, a central Rb domain, and a C-terminal NROR domain (Fig. 2B). Based on the recent classification, all these three fusion proteins in T. vaginalis are FDPFs (from now on, we denote them as TvFDPF1–3) (26Folgosa F. Martins M.C. Teixeira M. Diversity and complexity of flavodiiron NO/O2 reductases.FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2018; 365https://doi.org/10.1093/femsle/fnx267Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B). When compared with stand-alone FDPAs from T. vaginalis, G. lamblia, and several other organisms, the N-terminal FDP domain of TvFDPF1–3 includes the previously recognized canonical sequences containing the ligands of the diiron center: Fe 1 (His82-X-Glu84-X-Asp86-His87, TvFDPF3 numbering) and Fe 2 (His148-X18-Asp166-X64-His230) (Fig. S1). The middle domain of TvFDPF1–3 is homologous to Rbs and the C-terminal domain of bacterial rubrerythrin (Fig. S2). A central feature of the middle domain of TvFDPF1–3 is the presence of two pairs of Cys-X2-Cys sequence patterns that coordinate the iron of the Fe(SCys)4 center. This middle Rb-like domain is flanked at both sides by less conserved ∼25 to 30 amino acid linkers. The C-terminal domain of TvFDPF1–3 is homologous to previously described stand-alone NRORs (36Nishikawa K. Shomura Y. Kawasaki S. Niimura Y. Higuchi Y. Crystal structure of NADH:rubredoxin oxidoreductase from Clostridium acetobutylicum: a key component of the dioxygen scavenging system in obligatory anaerobes.Proteins. 2010; 78: 1066-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 37Hagelueken G.

A. 2007; 104: 12276-12281Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These proteins are using NADH to reduce the FAD cofactor, which subsequently donates electrons to the Rb or similar redox partners (36Nishikawa K. Shomura Y. Kawasaki S. Niimura Y. Higuchi Y. Crystal structure of NADH:rubredoxin oxidoreductase from Clostridium acetobutylicum: a key component of the dioxygen scavenging system in obligatory anaerobes.Proteins. 2010; 78: 1066-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 37Hagelueken G.

A. 2007; 104: 12276-12281Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We note that both the GxGxxG dinucleotide–binding motif and the NAD(P)H substrate specificity loop are identifiable in the C-terminal NROR domain of TvFDPF1–3 as well as in other closely related members of the tDBDF superfamily, including a “stand-alone” NROR, NADH:ferredoxin oxidoreductase, and CoA-disulfide reductase (Fig. S3). Because both NRORs and NOXes belong to the tDBDF superfamily of flavoenzymes, our initial BLAST analysis identified TvFDPF1–3 as the closest NOX homologs (i.e., the C-terminal domain of FDPFs [i.e., NROR] is homologous to NOX) (Fig. S3) (9Ojha S. Meng E.C. Babbitt P.C. Evolution of function in the ""two dinucleotide binding domains"" flavoproteins.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2007; 3: e121Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To test whether TvFDPF1–3 exhibit the H2O-forming oxidase activity and accept electrons directly from NADH or NADPH, the corresponding genes from T. vaginalis were cloned with a C-terminal hexa-histidine tag into a bacterial expression vector. All three genes had no introns, as it is common in T. vaginalis, G. lamblia, and other parasitic protozoa. When purified, all three recombinant proteins were brown in color and migrated as ∼100 kDa band as judged by the SDS-PAGE analysis (Figs. S4, A–C and S5). Notably, the TvFDPF2 protein was prone to severe aggregation, and during purification, the protein eluted in the void volume of the size-exclusion column. Based on analytical gel filtration and assuming a globular shape, we estimated an apparent molecular weight for TvFDPF1 of 272 ± 7 kDa and for TvFDPF3 of 289 ± 3 kDa. The absorption spectra of all three oxidized proteins had composite features resulting from a sum of flavin bands (contributing at 350–500 nm) and an Fe(SCys)4 center of Rb (contributing at 373 nm and above 500 nm) with maxima at 379, 454, 475, and 568 nm for TvFDPF1; 374, 451, 478, and 565 nm for TvFDPF2; and 378, 451, 475, and 574 nm for TvFDPF3 (Figs. S4, B and C and S5). In the presence of excess sodium dithionite, these cofactors were reduced, and the visible absorbance was almost completely bleached (Figs. S4, B and C and S5). We next employed LC–MS to determine both the molecular identity and quantity of flavin cofactors bound to TvFDPF1–3. While we unambiguously identified both FAD and FMN within TvFDPF1–3, the actual stoichiometries of these cofactors per protein monomer were drastically different (Table 1). Both TvFDPF1 and TvFDPF3 had full occupancy with FAD per monomer (1.02 ± 0.05 and 1.00 ± 0.12, respectively). However, FMN was present only at 0.010 ± 0.004 occupancy per monomer (∼1%) in TvFDPF1 and 0.090 ± 0.006 (∼9%) in TvFDPF3 (Table 1). TvFDPF2 had poor occupancy of both FAD and FMN,"

Preclinical data suggest that HIF-P4Hs could also be therapeutic targets for treating metabolic dysfunction, although the contributions of HIF-P4H isoenzymes in various tissues to the metabolic phenotype are inadequately understood. Here, we used mouse lines that were gene-deficient for HIF-P4Hs 1 to 3 and two preclinical pan-HIF-P4H inhibitors to study the contributions of these isoenzymes to the anthropometric and metabolic outcome and HIF response. We show both inhibitors induced a HIF response in wildtype white adipose tissue (WAT), liver, and skeletal muscle and alleviated metabolic dysfunction during a 6-week treatment period, but they did not alter healthy metabolism. Our data indicate that HIF-P4H-1 contributed especially to skeletal muscle and WAT metabolism and that its loss lowered body weight and serum cholesterol levels upon aging. In addition, we found HIF-P4H-3 had effects on the liver and WAT and its loss increased body weight, adiposity, liver weight and triglyceride levels, WAT inflammation, and cholesterol levels and resulted in hyperglycemia and insulin resistance, especially during aging. Finally, we demonstrate HIF-P4H-2 affected all tissues studied; its inhibition lowered body and liver weight and serum cholesterol levels and improved glucose tolerance. We found very few HIF target metabolic mRNAs were regulated by the inhibition of three isoenzymes, thus suggesting a potential for selective therapeutic tractability. Altogether, these data provide specifications for the future development of HIF-P4H inhibitors for the treatment of metabolic diseases."

Chromatin interactions between gene's promoters and their enhancers have an important role in transcriptional control. However, the high-resolution chromatin interactions of myogenic genes and their functional enhancers during myogenesis remain largely unclear. Here, we used circularized chromosome conformation capture coupled with next generation sequencing (4C-seq) to investigate eight myogenic marker genes in C2C12 myoblasts (C2C12-MBs) and C2C12 myotubes (C2C12-MTs). We revealed dynamic chromatin interactions of these marker genes during differentiation and identified 163 and 314 significant interaction sites (SISs) in C2C12-MBs and C2C12-MTs, respectively. The interacting genes of SISs in C2C12-MTs were mainly involved in muscle development, and histone modifications of the SISs changed during differentiation. Through functional genomic screening, we also identified 25 and 41 putative active enhancers in C2C12-MBs and C2C12-MTs, respectively. Using luciferase reporter assays for putative enhancers of Myog and Myh3, we identified eight activating enhancers. Furthermore, dCas9-KRAB epigenome editing and RNA-Seq revealed a role for Myog enhancers in the regulation of Myog expression and myogenic differentiation in the native genomic context. Taken together, this study lays the groundwork for understanding 3D chromatin interaction changes of myogenic genes during myogenesis and provides insights that contribute to our understanding of the role of enhancers in regulating myogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W4283780226,"The protease inhibitor α2-macroglobulin (A2M) is a member of the ancient α2-macroglobulin superfamily (A2MF), which also includes structurally related proteins, such as complement factor C3. A2M and other A2MF proteins undergo an extensive conformational change upon cleavage of their bait region by proteases. However, the mechanism whereby cleavage triggers the change has not yet been determined. We have previously shown that A2M remains functional after completely replacing its bait region with glycine and serine residues. Here, we use this tabula rasa bait region to investigate several hypotheses for the triggering mechanism. When tabula rasa bait regions containing disulfide loops were elongated by reducing the disulfides, we found that A2M remained in its native conformation. In addition, cleavage within a disulfide loop did not trigger the conformational change until after the disulfide was reduced, indicating that the introduction of discontinuity into the bait region is essential to the trigger. Previously, A2MF structures have shown that the C-terminal end of the bait region (a.k.a. the N-terminal region of the truncated α chain) threads through a central channel in native A2MF proteins. Bait region cleavage abolishes this plug-in-channel arrangement, as the bait region retracts from the channel and the channel itself collapses. We found that mutagenesis of conserved plug-in-channel residues disrupted the formation of native A2M. These results provide experimental evidence for a structural hypothesis in which retraction of the bait region from this channel following cleavage and the channel's subsequent collapse triggers the conformational change of A2M and other A2MF proteins."

Different studies have reported positive effects on range of motion, strength or function in musculoskeletal disorders, mainly in the upper extremity. The incidence and recurrence rates of hamstring injuries are high in many sports. However, there are no studies assessing these parameters in the hamstring and gluteus maximus in athletes. Objective. To evaluate the immediate and 30 minutes post-treatment effects of a single diacutaneous fibrolysis session on hamstring length, flexibility, muscle strength, myoelectrical activity and lower limb performance in athletes with hamstring shortening.A randomized within-participant clinical trial. Sixty-six athletes with hamstring shortening were recruited. A single session of diacutaneous fibrolysis was applied following the cetripetal protocol to the gluteus maximus, biceps femoris and semitendinosus of for the experimental lower limb, whereas the control limb was not treated. Hamstring length (Passive knee extension test), hamstring and low back flexibility (Modified back saver sit and reach test), hamstring and gluteus maximus strength and electrical activity (dynamometry and surface electromyography, respectively) and lower limb performance (Countermovement Jump) were tested before treatment (T0), after treatment (T1), and 30 minutes post-treatment (T2).We only found a statistically significant difference between T0-T2 for the hamstring length favouring the experimental limbs (p<0.001). There were no statistically significant changes for hamstring and lower back flexibility, strength and electrical activity outcomes between groups. In the countermovement jump, we found a decrease of 0.58 cm in the high jump and a decrease of 9.19 N in the power jump at T1. These values recovered and improved at T2. However, these changes were not statistically significant (p>0.05).A single session of diacutaneous fibrolysis in athletes with hamstring shortening, following the centripetal protocol for the posterior part of the thigh, produces improvements in hamstring length 30 minutes after, and in gluteus maximus strength immediately and 30 minutes after the treatment. It seems to have no effects on the overall hamstring and lower back flexibility or myoelectric activity. Importantly, the lower limb performance was not impaired after the treatment."
https://openalex.org/W4284674218,"Control charts for the coefficient of variations (γ) are receiving increasing attention as it is able to monitor the stability in the ratio of the standard deviation (σ) over the mean (μ), unlike conventional charts that monitor the μ and/or σ separately. A side-sensitive synthetic (SS) chart for monitoring γ was recently developed for univariate processes. The chart outperforms the non-side-sensitive synthetic (NSS) γ chart. However, the SS chart monitoring γ for multivariate processes cannot be found. Thus, a SS chart for multivariate processes is proposed in this paper. A SS chart for multivariate processes is important as multiple quality characteristic that are correlated with each other are frequently encountered in practical scenarios. Based on numerical examples, the side-sensitivity feature that is included in the multivariate synthetic γ chart significantly improves the sensitivity of the chart based on the run length performance, particularly in detecting small shifts (τ), and for small sample size (n), as well as a large number of variables (p) and in-control γ (γ0). The multivariate SS chart also significantly outperforms the Shewhart γ chart, and marginally outperforms the Multivariate Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (MEWMA) γ chart when shift sizes are moderate and large. To show its implementation, the proposed multivariate SS chart is adopted to monitor investment risks."

Glycolaldehyde (GA) has been shown to impair cellular function in various disorders, including diabetes, and renal diseases. This study investigated the effect of GA on the expression of adhesion molecules in the mouse VSMC line, MOVAS-1. Co-incubation of VSMCs with GA (25-50 μM) dose-dependently increased the protein and mRNA level of Vcam-1 and ICAM-1. Additionally, GA upregulated intracellular ROS production and phosphorylation of MAPK and NK-κB. GA also elevated TNF-α-induced PI3K-AKT activation. Furthermore, GA enhanced TNF-α-activated IκBα kinase activation, subsequent IκBα degradation, and nuclear translocation of NF-κB. These findings suggest that GA stumulated VSMC adhesive capacity and the induction of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 in VSMCs through inhibition of MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways, providing insights into the effect of GA to induce inflammation within atherosclerotic lesions."

However, many people in Sri Lanka with CHD do not engage in adequate physical activity.To develop a culture-specific, motivated, and action-based intervention and examine its effects on physical activity level, exercise self-efficacy, and cardiovascular risk factors among patients with CHD.This is an assessor-blinded randomized controlled trial that will recruit 150 patients with CHD from the inpatients cardiac unit of a hospital in Batticaloa, Sri Lanka, and will randomly assign them either to the intervention group or the control group. The participants in the intervention group will receive a culture-specific and motivated, action-based intervention in addition to the usual care, while participants in the control will only receive the usual care. The intervention consists of a face-to-face preparatory session and 12-week motivated, action-based sessions which were developed based on the health action process approach (HAPA) framework. The face-to-face preparatory session will identify the health needs of the participants, develop a goal-oriented patient-centered action plan, and provide knowledge and an overview of the program. The 12-week motivated, action-based sessions consist of three monthly group education and center-based group exercises, followed by three 20-min individualized telephone follow-ups. Outcomes will be assessed immediately after the intervention and at one-month post-intervention.This protocol proposes a supervised centered-based group exercise with group education, and individualized telephone follow-ups guided by the HAPA framework to improve the physical activity level, exercise self-efficacy, and cardiovascular risk factors of patients with CHD. Results from this study will inform the effectiveness of a motivated, action-based intervention in a low-resource setting and provide information on the feasibility, barriers, and facilitators for lifestyle modification in Sri Lanka.ClinicalTrial.gov.org PRS: NCT05051774; Date of registration: September 21, 2021."
https://openalex.org/W4284682457,"The opioid crisis is a growing public health emergency and increasing resources are being directed towards overdose education. Simulation has emerged as a novel strategy for training overdose response, yet little is known about training non-clinicians in bystander resuscitation. Understanding the perspectives of individuals who are likely to experience or witness opioid overdose is critical to ensure that emergency response is effective. The Surviving Opioid Overdose with Naloxone Education and Resuscitation (SOONER) study evaluates the effectiveness of a novel naloxone education and distribution tool among people who are non-clinicians and likely to witness opioid overdose. Participants’ resuscitation skills are evaluated using a realistic overdose simulation as the primary outcome of the trial. The purpose of our study is to describe the experience of participants with the simulation process in the SOONER study. We employed a semi-structured debriefing interview and a follow up qualitative interview to understand the experience of participants with simulation. A qualitative content analysis was performed using data from 21 participants who participated in the SOONER study. Our qualitative analysis identified 5 themes and 17 subthemes which described the experience of participants within the simulation process. These themes included realism, valuing practical experience, improving self-efficacy, gaining new perspective and bidirectional learning. Our analysis found that simulation was a positive and empowering experience for participants in the SOONER trial, most of whom are marginalized in society. Our study supports the notion that expanding simulation-based education to non-clinicians may offer an acceptable and effective way of supplementing current opioid overdose education strategies. Increasing the accessibility of simulation-based education may represent a paradigm shift whereby simulation is transformed from a primarily academic practice into a patient-based community resource."
https://openalex.org/W4284704921,"We have summarized our experience regarding transurethral seminal vesiculoscopy (TUSV) and analyzed both its recurrence status and the risk factors for recurrence. From January 2010 to December 2020, 48 patients with intractable hemospermia received successful TUSV at Taichung Invalids General Hospital. Upon analysis of the intraoperative findings, the five-year disease-free Survival rates (DFS) were 74.1% in the no calculus group compared to 37.1% in the calculus group with a significant difference (log-rank p = 0.015), 75.0% in the no hemorrhage or no blood clot group compared to 43.2% in the hemorrhage or blood clot group with significant difference (log-rank p = 0.032). Univariate analysis showed intraoperative calculus (p = 0.040; HR: 2.94, 95% CI: 1.05-8.21) to be significantly associated with recurrence (p < 0.05). Patients with intractable hemospermia who were diagnosed with stones or blood clots found during TUSV experienced a higher rate of hemospermia recurrence."
https://openalex.org/W4284705630,"Few studies have evaluated the optimal sampling design for tracking small mammal population trends, especially for rare or difficult to detect species. Spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) models present an advancement over non-spatial models by accounting for individual movement when estimating density. The salt marsh harvest mouse (SMHM; Reithrodontomys raviventris) is a federal and California state listed endangered species endemic to the San Francisco Bay-Delta estuary, California, USA; where a population in a subembayment has been continually monitored over an 18-year period using mark-recapture methods. We analyzed capture data within a SECR modeling framework that allowed us to account for differences in detection and movement between sexes. We compared the full dataset to subsampling scenarios to evaluate how the grid size (area) of the trap design, trap density (spacing), and number of consecutive trapping occasions (duration) influenced density estimates. To validate the subsampling methods, we ran Monte Carlo simulations based on the true parameter estimates for each specific year. We found that reducing the area of the trapping design by more than 36% resulted in the inability of the SECR model to replicate density estimates within the SE of the original density estimates. However, when trapping occasions were reduced from 4 to 3-nights the density estimates were indistinguishable from the full dataset. Furthermore, reducing trap density by 50% also resulted in density estimates comparable to the full dataset and was a substantially better model than reducing the trap area by 50%. Overall, our results indicated that moderate reductions in the number of trapping occasions or trap density could yield similar density estimates when using a SECR approach. This approach allows the optimization of field trapping efforts and designs by reducing field efforts while maintaining the same population estimate compared to the full dataset. Using a SECR approach may help other wildlife programs identify sampling efficiencies without sacrificing data integrity for long term monitoring of population densities."
https://openalex.org/W4284705823,"Exam-related unwanted intrusive thoughts (UITs) and related neutralizing behaviors are common experiences among students. The present study investigated in what ways these UITs and behaviors are analogues to clinical obsessions and compulsions. Twenty-nine students completed three ecological momentary assessment surveys per day over 7 consecutive days, assessing the severity of exam-related UITs and related neutralizing behaviors, obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptoms, anxiety, distress, urge to neutralize, depressed mood, and stress in the week immediately before an exam period. Multilevel analysis demonstrated that the severity of exam-related UITs and related neutralizing behaviors was positively associated with OC symptoms, anxiety, distress, urge to neutralize, and stress but was not related to depressed mood. During the study period, the exam-related UITs occurred on average 7 times, and the related neutralizing behaviors on average 6 times. Overall, they were experienced with mild severity, low distress, and low urge to neutralize. Findings indicate that some aspects of exam-related UITs and related neutralizing behaviors (e.g., association with distress and urge to neutralize) might be analogous to OC symptoms but not all (e.g., no relation to depressed mood). We discuss how research on obsessive-compulsive disorder could benefit from considering exam-related UITs and related behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W4284711361,"Previous data suggest zero-value, neutral outcomes (draw) are subjectively assigned negative rather than positive valence. The combined observations of faster rather than slower reaction times, subsequent actions defined by shift rather than stay behaviour, reduced flexibility, and, larger rather than smaller deviations from optimal performance following draws all align with the consequences of explicitly negative outcomes such as losses. We further tested the relationships between neutral, positive and negative outcomes by manipulating value salience and observing their behavioural profiles. Despite speeded reaction times and a non-significant bias towards shift behaviour similar to losses when draws were assigned the value of 0 (Experiment 1), the degree of shift behaviour approached an approximation of optimal performance when the draw value was explicitly positive (+1). This was in contrast to when the draw value was explicitly negative (-1), which led to a significant increase in the degree of shift behaviour (Experiment 2). Similar modifications were absent when the same value manipulations were applied to win or lose trials (Experiment 3). Rather than viewing draws as neutral and valence-free outcomes, the processing cascade generated by draws produces a complex behavioural profile containing elements found in response to both explicitly positive and explicitly negative results."
