https://openalex.org/W1999908724,"The long-standing challenge of designing and constructing new crystalline solid-state materials from molecular building blocks is just beginning to be addressed with success. A conceptual approach that requires the use of secondary building units to direct the assembly of ordered frameworks epitomizes this process: we call this approach reticular synthesis. This chemistry has yielded materials designed to have predetermined structures, compositions and properties. In particular, highly porous frameworks held together by strong metal-oxygen-carbon bonds and with exceptionally large surface area and capacity for gas storage have been prepared and their pore metrics systematically varied and functionalized."

The energy needed to rupture a fibre (its toughness) is five times higher for spider silk than for the same mass of steel wire, which has inspired efforts to produce spider silk commercially1,2,3. Here we spin 100-metre-long carbon-nanotube composite fibres that are tougher than any natural or synthetic organic fibre described so far, and use these to make fibre supercapacitors that are suitable for weaving into textiles."

https://openalex.org/W1972989121,"Quantum information science attempts to exploit capabilities from the quantum realm to accomplish tasks that are otherwise impossible in the classical domain. Although sufficient conditions have been formulated for the physical resources required to achieve quantum computation and communication, there is a growing understanding of the power of quantum measurement combined with the conditional evolution of quantum states for accomplishing diverse tasks in quantum information science. For example, a protocol has recently been developed for the realization of scalable long-distance quantum communication and the distribution of entanglement over quantum networks. Here we report the first enabling step in the realization of this protocol, namely the observation of quantum correlations for photon pairs generated in the collective emission from an atomic ensemble. The nonclassical character of the fields is demonstrated by the violation of an inequality involving their normalized correlation functions. Compared to previous investigations of non-classical correlations for photon pairs produced in atomic cascades and in parametric down-conversion, our experiment is distinct in that the correlated photons are separated by a programmable time interval (of about 400 nanoseconds in our initial experiments)."

Here we follow New World Catharus thrushes during their nocturnal migratory flights1,2, recapturing individuals after journeys of up to 600 km and determining their energy expenditure by using doubly labelled water3,4. Although flight itself is costly, our results confirm the counterintuitive prediction that songbirds expend double the amount of energy during stopovers that they spend on flight over their entire migration5,6."
https://openalex.org/W2035169307,"Many-body systems in nature exhibit complexity and self-organization arising from seemingly simple laws. For example, the long-range Coulomb interaction between electrical charges has a simple form, yet is responsible for a plethora of bound states in matter, ranging from the hydrogen atom to complex biochemical structures. Semiconductors form an ideal laboratory for studying many-body interactions of electronic quasiparticles among themselves and with lattice vibrations and light. Oppositely charged electron and hole quasiparticles can coexist in an ionized but correlated plasma, or form bound hydrogen-like pairs called excitons. The pathways between such states, however, remain elusive in near-visible optical experiments that detect a subset of excitons with vanishing centre-of-mass momenta. In contrast, transitions between internal exciton levels, which occur in the far-infrared at terahertz (1012 s(-1)) frequencies, are independent of this restriction, suggesting their use as a probe of electron-hole pair dynamics. Here we employ an ultrafast terahertz probe to investigate directly the dynamical interplay of optically-generated excitons and unbound electron-hole pairs in GaAs quantum wells. Our observations reveal an unexpected quasi-instantaneous excitonic enhancement, the formation of insulating excitons on a 100-ps timescale, and the conditions under which excitonic populations prevail."
https://openalex.org/W2171469414,"Chronic use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is associated with a lower risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. Recent evidence indicates that some NSAIDs specifically inhibit secretion of the amyloidogenic Aβ42 peptide in cultured cells and mouse models of Alzheimer's disease. The reduction of Aβ42 peptides is not mediated by inhibition of cyclooxygenases (COX) but the molecular mechanism underlying this novel activity of NSAIDs has not been further defined. We now demonstrate that NSAIDs efficiently reduce the intracellular pool of Aβ42 in cell-based studies and selectively decrease Aβ42 production in a cell-free assay of γ-secretase activity. Moreover, we find that presenilin-1 (PS1) mutations, which affect γ-secretase activity, differentially modulate the cellular Aβ42 response to NSAID treatment. Overexpression of the PS1-M146L mutation enhances the cellular drug response to Aβ42 lowering NSAIDs as compared with cells expressing wild-type PS1. In contrast, expression of the PS1-ΔExon9 mutation strongly diminishes the Aβ42 response, showing that PS1 mutations can modulate the cellular drug response to NSAID treatment both positively and negatively. Enhancement of the NSAID drug response was also observed with overexpression of the APP V717F mutation but not with Swedish mutant APP, which affects β-secretase cleavage. In sum, these results strongly suggest that NSAIDs represent a founding group of compounds that lower Aβ42 production by direct modulation of γ-secretase activity or its substrate."

https://openalex.org/W2045725116,"Chronic infections with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) and high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are important risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cervical cancer (CC), respectively. HBV and HPV are DNA viruses that almost invariably integrate into the host genome in invasive tumors. The viral integration sites occur throughout the genome, leading to the presumption that there are no preferred sites of integration. A number of viral integrations have been shown to occur within the vicinity of important cancer-related genes. In studies of HBV-induced HCC and HPV-induced CC, we have identified two HBV and three HPV integrations into the human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) gene. Detailed characterization of the integrations revealed that four integrations occurred within the hTERT promoter and upstream region and the fifth integration occurred in intron 3 of the hTERT gene. None of the integrations altered the hTERT coding sequence and all resulted in juxtaposition of viral enhancers near hTERT, with potential activation of hTERT expression. Our work supports the hypothesis that the sites of oncogenic viral integration are nonrandom and that genes at the sites of viral integration may play important roles in carcinogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2087457210,"Recently, we have characterized the Ras association domain family 1A gene (RASSF1A) at the segment 3p21.3, which is frequently lost in variety of human cancers and epigenetically inactivated in many types of primary tumors, such as lung, breast, kidney, prostate and thyroid carcinomas. Here, we investigated the methylation status of the RASSF1A CpG island promoter in the pathogenesis of pancreatic cancer. RASSF1A hypermethylation was detected in 29 out of 45 (64%) primary adenocarcinomas, in 10 out of 12 (83%) endocrine tumors and in eight out of 18 (44%) pancreatitis samples. In seven out of eight pancreas cancer cell lines, RASSF1A was silenced and was retranscribed after treatment with 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine. Additionally, we analysed the aberrant methylation frequency of cell cycle inhibitor p16INK4a and K-ras gene mutations in the pancreatic samples. p16 inactivation was detected in 43% of adenocarcinomas, in 17% of neuroendocrine tumors, in 18% of pancreatitis and in 63% of pancreas cancer cell lines. K-ras mutations were detected in 16 out of 45 (36%) primary adenocarcinomas. Pancreatic adenocarcinomas with K-ras mutation have significantly less RASSF1A methylation and vice versa (P=0.001, χ2 test). In conclusion, our data indicate that inactivation of the RASSF1A gene is a frequent event in pancreatic cancer and suggest an inverse correlation between RASSF1A silencing and K-ras activation."

https://openalex.org/W2017613141,"The AAA+ protein ClpB mediates the solubilization of protein aggregates in cooperation with the DnaK chaperone system (KJE). The order of action of ClpB and KJE on aggregated proteins is unknown. We describe a ClpB variant with mutational alterations in the Walker B motif of both AAA domains (E279A/E678A), which binds but does not hydrolyze ATP. This variant associates <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> in a stable manner with protein substrates, demonstrating direct interaction of ClpB with protein aggregates for the first time. Substrate interaction is strictly dependent on ATP binding to both AAA domains of ClpB. The unique substrate binding properties of the double Walker B variant allowed to dissect the order of ClpB and DnaK action during disaggregation reactions. ClpB-E279A/E678A outcompetes the DnaK system for binding to the model substrate TrfA and inhibits the dissociation of small protein aggregates by DnaK only, indicating that ClpB acts prior to DnaK on protein substrates."
https://openalex.org/W2146191765,"We have investigated the mechanism whereby tumor cells become resistant to the antiproliferative effects of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, while maintaining other responses that can lead to increased malignancy and invasiveness. TGF-beta signaling results in nuclear accumulation of active Smad complexes which regulate transcription of target genes. Here we show that in two pancreatic carcinoma cell lines, PT45 and Panc-1, that are resistant to TGF-beta-induced growth arrest, the TGF-beta-Smad signaling pathway is attenuated compared with epithelial cells that are sensitive to the antiproliferative effects of TGF-beta (HaCaT and Colo-357). In PT45 and Panc-1 cells, active Smad complexes remain nuclear for only 1-2 h compared with more than 6 h in HaCaT and Colo-357 cells. The attenuated pathway in PT45 and Panc-1 cells correlates with low levels of TGF-beta type I receptor and results in an altered expression profile of TGF-beta-inducible genes required for cell cycle arrest. Most significantly, expression of the CDK inhibitor, p21(Cip1/WAF1), which is required for TGF-beta-induced growth arrest in these cells, is not maintained. Moreover, we show that artificially attenuating the TGF-beta-Smad signaling pathway in HaCaT cells is sufficient to prevent TGF-beta-induced growth arrest. Our results demonstrate that the duration of TGF-beta-Smad signaling is a critical determinant of the specificity of the TGF-beta response."

The activated binding component C2IIa forms heptamers, which bind to carbohydrates on the cell surface and interact with the enzyme component C2I. This toxin complex is taken up by receptor-mediated endocytosis. In acidic endosomes, heptameric C2IIa forms pores and mediates the translocation of C2I into the cytosol. We report that the heat shock protein (Hsp) 90-specific inhibitors, geldanamycin or radicicol, block intoxication of Vero cells, rat astrocytes, and HeLa cells by C2 toxin. ADP-ribosylation of actin in the cytosol of toxin-treated cells revealed that less active C2I was translocated into the cytosol after treatment with Hsp90 inhibitors. Under control conditions, C2I was localized in the cytosol of toxin-treated rat astrocytes, whereas geldanamycin blocked the cytosolic distribution of C2I. At low extracellular pH (pH 4.5), which allows the direct translocation of C2I via C2IIa heptamers across the cell membrane into the cytosol, Hsp90 inhibitors retarded intoxication by C2I. Geldanamycin did not affect toxin binding, endocytosis, and pore formation by C2IIa. The ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of C2I was not affected by Hsp90 inhibitors in vitro.

Bacterial AB-toxins are composed of an enzyme domain (A) and a binding domain (B) that mediates cell binding and uptake of the A domain (1Olsnes S. Wesche J. Falnes P.O. Aktories K. Just I. Bacterial Protein Toxins. Springer-Verlag, Berlin2000: 1-14Crossref Google Scholar). In the family of binary toxins, the A and B domains are located on separated proteins, the enzyme component and binding component. Members of the family of binary actin-ADP-ribosylating toxins are the Clostridium botulinum C2 toxin (2Aktories K. Bärmann M. Ohishi I. Tsuyama S. Jakobs K.H. Habermann E.

(49 kDa) and the binding/translocation component C2II that delivers C2I into the cytosol of target cells. C2II (80 kDa) must be activated by trypsin cleavage (11Ohishi I. Infect. Immun. 1987; 55: 1461-1465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An ∼20-kDa peptide is cleaved from the N terminus. The resulting C2IIa (∼60 kDa) forms ring-shaped heptamers, which assemble with C2I and bind to complex and hybrid carbohydrate structures on the cell surface (12Eckhardt M. Barth H. Blöcker D. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2328-2334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The C2 toxin-receptor complex is taken up via receptor-mediated endocytosis, and C2I translocates from the early acidic endosomal compartment into the cytosol (10Barth H. Blöcker D. Behlke J. Bergsma-Schutter W. Brisson A. Benz R. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18704-18711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). This step can be blocked by bafilomycin A1, a specific inhibitor of the vesicular H+-ATPase (10Barth H. Blöcker D. Behlke J. Bergsma-Schutter W. Brisson A. Benz R. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18704-18711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Recently, we reported that this step could be mimicked on the cell surface, when cells were exposed to an acidic pulse after binding of both toxin components to the cell surface (10Barth H.

It was proposed that at low pH C2IIa heptamers insert into the endosomal membrane and form pores with an inner diameter of about 1–2 nm (10Barth H. Blöcker D. Behlke J. Bergsma-Schutter W.

Similarly, C2IIa forms pores in cell membranes of intact cells under acidic conditions. 2D. Blöcker, K. Pohlmann, G. Haug, C. Bachmeyer, R. Benz, K. Aktories, and H. Barth, manuscript in preparation.2D. Blöcker, K. Pohlmann, G. Haug, C. Bachmeyer, R. Benz, K. Aktories, and H. Barth, manuscript in preparation. The binding component C2II has high homology to the protective antigen (PA) of anthrax toxins (13Blöcker D. Barth H. Maier E. Benz R. Barbieri J.T. Aktories K. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 4566-4573Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and the uptake mechanism of anthrax toxins appears to be very similar to that of C. botulinum C2 toxin and the other actin-ADP-ribosylating toxins (14Barth H. Blöcker D. Aktories K. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 2002; 366: 501-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Anthrax toxin is a tripartite toxin and consists of the binding component PA and of the enzyme components lethal factor (LF) and edema factor (EF), which are both unrelated to the enzyme component of C2 toxin. Whereas lethal factor LF is a metalloprotease that cleaves mitogen-activated protein kinases (15Duesbery N.S. Webb C.P. Leppla S.H. Gordon V.M. Klimpel K.R. Copeland T.D. Ahn N.G. Oskarsson M.K. Fukasawa K. Paull K.D. Woude G.F.V. Science. 1998; 280: 734-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar), edema factor is a calmodulin-dependent adenylyl cyclase (16Leppla S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 3162-3166Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar). It was first shown for anthrax toxin that the binding component (PA) forms heptamers and pores that are involved in the delivery of the anthrax enzymes EF and LF into the cytosol (17Milne J.C. Collier R.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 647-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 18Milne J.C. Furlong D. Hanna P.C. Wall J.S. Collier R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20607-20612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the precise mechanism of translocation across the endosomal membrane is not known for actin-ADP-ribosylating toxins or for anthrax toxin. One model suggests that the enzyme components are delivered through the pore formed by the binding components. Therefore, it may be expected that the enzyme components become partially unfolded during the translocation step and refolded in the cytosol. For LF, it was reported that unfolding of the protein was necessary for translocation (19Wesche J. Elliott J.L. Falnes P.O. Olsnes S. Collier R.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15737-15746Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Recently we obtained similar results for C2I.2 These findings imply that refolding of proteins occurs in the cytosol, a process that might involve chaperones. Here, we studied the role of the heat shock protein Hsp90 in cellular uptake of C. botulinum C2 toxin, C. perfringens iota toxin, and Bacillus anthracis lethal toxin. We used the specific pharmacological inhibitors geldanamycin or radicicol to inhibit the chaperone function of Hsp90 (for review, see Ref. 20Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Exp. Biol. Med. 2003; 228: 111-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar). We report that Hsp90 is necessary for translocation of active C2I into the cytosol and that Hsp90 is essential for cytotoxic action of C. botulinum C2 toxin, C. perfringens iota toxin, and the C2IN-C3 fusion toxin. In contrast, inhibition of Hsp90 did not protect macrophage-like cells from the cytotoxic action of anthrax lethal toxin. Moreover, cytotoxic action of the glucosylating C. difficile toxin B, which also translocates from acidic endosomes into the cytosol, was not influenced by geldanamycin or radicicol. Materials—Cell culture medium was obtained from Biochrom (Berlin, Germany), fetal calf serum was from PAN Systems (Aidenbach, Germany), and cell culture materials were obtained from Falcon (Heidelberg, Germany). The components of C2 toxin (C2I, C2IS16C, C2II) and the components of iota toxin (Ia and Ib) were purified as recombinant glutathione S-transferase proteins as described previously (21Barth H.

Recombinant anthrax lethal factor and protective antigen were purchased from Quadratech (Surrey, UK). [32P]NAD (30 Ci/mmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. 86Rb+ was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Bafilomycin A1 was obtained from Calbiochem. Geldanamycin, radicicol, trypsin, lysophosphatidic acid, MG-132 (N-CBZ-Leu-Leu-Leu-Al), and leupeptin were purchased from Sigma. Alexa-488 was obtained from MoBiTec (Göttingen, Germany). The antiserum against C2I was prepared from rabbit. Cell Culture and Cytotoxicity Assays—African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells, HeLa, and J774.A1 macrophage-like cells were cultivated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% heat-inactivated (30 min, 56 °C) fetal calf serum at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Embryonic bovine lung (EBL) cells were grown in minimum Eagle's medium containing 15% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were cultivated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium. All media contained 2 mml-glutamate, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were routinely trypsinized and reseeded twice per week. For cytotoxicity experiments, cells were seeded in 96-well plates and incubated with the respective inhibitor or toxin in complete medium. Cell viability of J774.A1 cells was determined by using the Cell Titer 96® Aqueous non-radioactive cell proliferation assay from Promega (Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Astrocyte cultures were obtained from newborn Wistar rats (23Hildebrand B. Olenik C. Uhl A. Meyer D.K. Brain Res. 1997; 759: 285-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). After isolation of the cortices of the rat brains, the surrounding meninges were removed before mincing. The fragments were incubated with 0.25% trypsin in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS 8.1 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 137 nm NaCl, and 2.7 mm KCl, pH 7.5) at 37 °C for 10 min. The enzymatically treated fragments were then dissociated into single cells by pipetting, and the cells were suspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 5 mm HEPES buffer, 0.2 mg/liter lysophosphatidic acid. The cells were maintained at 37 °C in 8.6% CO2 for 10 days. Immunocytochemistry—Cells were fixed with methanol (–20 °C) for 10 min, washed with PBS, and permeabilized with 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100. Normal goat serum was used to block unspecific reactions. Thereafter, cells were incubated with the primary polyclonal rabbit anti-C2 toxin antibody or together with the Rab5 antibody (BD Bioscience, Heidelberg, Germany). The C2 toxin immune complexes were visualized by using a CyTm 3-conjugated F(ab′)2 fragment of goat anti-rabbit IgG (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany); the Rab5 immune complexes were visualized by using an Alexa-488-conjugated F(ab′)2 fragment of goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes, Heidelberg, Germany). For actin-staining, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, washed with PBS, and permeabilized with 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100. Afterward, the cells were incubated with TRITC-conjugated phalloidin (Biozol, München, Germany) and washed again with PBS. Cells were visualized by using a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 (version 3.2) confocal system with a krypton-argon laser and a Zeiss (Oberkochen, Germany) Axiovert 135TV microscope. Images were obtained by using Laser sharp 2.1T software and processed by using the Metamorph 6.1 Software (Visitron, Munich, Germany). The intensity of the C2 toxin-staining in the endosomes was compared with the intensity in the cytosol by using the Metamorph 6.1 software. Single z-stock micrographs were obtained with identical settings from the confocal system. The intensity of staining of five endosomes per cell was measured and compared with the intensity of five randomly chosen areas per cell in the cytosol. Ten cells were analyzed for each treatment group in this way. The average of the intensity of the endosome-staining was set as 100% for each group and was compared with the cytosol group. ADP-ribosylation Assay—Cells were washed with cold PBS, scraped into 300 μl of cold lysis buffer (2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 80 μg/ml benzamidine in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4), and sonicated with 10 strokes on ice. ADP-ribosylation was performed as described (10Barth H. Blöcker D. Behlke J. Bergsma-Schutter W. Brisson A. Benz R. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18704-18711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In brief, 50 μg of lysate protein (25 μl) were incubated with [32P]NAD (0.5 μm) and 100 ng of C2I for 10 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of Laemmli buffer, and the samples were heated for 3 min at 95 °C and subsequently subjected to SDS-PAGE. [32P]ADP-ribosylated proteins were detected by autoradiography with a PhosphorImager from Molecular Dynamics/Amersham Biosciences. Pore-forming Assay— 86Rb+ efflux experiments were performed as previously described (24Barth H. Pfeifer G. Hofmann F. Maier E. Benz R. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10670-10676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In brief, CHO cells were plated in 24-well culture plates and loaded with 86Rb+ (1 μCi/ml) for 20 h. C2IIa was added to serum-free medium, and cells were incubated on ice for 1 h to allow for toxin binding. Subsequently, the cells were washed twice with cold medium to remove unbound toxin. To initiate membrane insertion of the toxins, cells were treated with serum-free medium (pH 4.5 and for control pH 7.5) for 5 min at 37 °C. Cells were further incubated at 4 °C, and 86Rb+ release into the medium was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Binding of C2 Toxin by Flow Cytometry—C2IS16C was labeled with Alexa-488, and binding of C2 toxin to CHO cells was determined as described earlier in detail (21Barth H. Roebling R. Fritz M. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5074-5081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Cell-associated fluorescence was detected by using a FACSCalibur fluorescence-activated cytometer (BD Biosciences). Hsp90 Inhibitors Geldanamycin and Radicicol Protect Eukaryotic Cells from C2 Cytotoxic Effects—We tested whether Hsp90 was necessary for the cytotoxic action of the C2 toxin on various eukaryotic cell lines. Therefore, Hsp90 was blocked by the specific inhibitors geldanamycin or radicicol. When African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells were treated with C2 toxin (50 ng/ml C2I and 100 ng/ml C2IIa) for 3 h, cells rounded up. When cells were pretreated for 1 h with geldanamycin (1 μm)or radicicol (1 μm) before C2 toxin addition, cell rounding was blocked (Fig. 1A). However, neither geldanamycin nor radicicol blocked C2 toxin effects completely but instead delayed intoxication of cells (Fig. 1B). Higher concentrations of geldanamycin (10 μm) protected Vero cells for more than 5 h from cytotoxic C2 toxin effects. The combination of geldanamycin plus radicicol showed similar effects as the individual components but did not act synergistically. The inhibitors alone did not influence cell morphology within 5 h (not shown). Less actin was ADP-ribosylated in cells pretreated for 1 h with geldanamycin before C2 toxin addition, as detected by sequential ADP-ribosylation with C2I in the presence of [32P]NAD. Actin, previously ADP-ribosylated by C2 toxin in intact cells, was no longer a substrate for in vitro ADP-ribosylation. The autoradiograph of [32P]ADP-ribosylated actin is shown in Fig. 2A. Hsp90 inhibitors had no effect on ADP-ribosylation of actin by C2I, as determined by ADP-ribosylation of actin from cell lysates in vitro with C2I and [32P]NAD in the presence of geldanamycin or radicicol. Neither geldanamycin nor radicicol decreased ADP-ribosylation of actin in vitro (Fig. 2B). These findings suggest that less active C2I was present in the cytosol of cells after pretreatment with Hsp90 inhibitors. Inhibition of Hsp90 by geldanamycin also protected human HeLa cells and EBL cells from C2 toxin (data not shown). We used the recently described C2-C3 fusion toxin (21Barth H. Roebling R. Fritz M. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5074-5081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) to test whether Hsp90 is essential for transport of the fusion toxins, which are based on C2IIa as a delivery system. In this fusion toxin, the C3 transferase from Clostridium limosum, which ADP-ribosylates and inhibits Rho GTPase (25Aktories K. Braun U. Rösener S. Just I. Hall A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 158: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), was fused to the C2I1–225 adaptor domain of C2I. C2I-C3 is transported into cells via C2IIa (26Barth H. Hofmann F. Olenik C. Just I. Aktories K. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1364-1369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Geldanamycin blocked intoxication of cells with the C2-C3 fusion toxin/C2IIa complex, as shown for EBL cells in Fig. 3. This observation suggests that the C2I1–225-C3 fusion toxin is delivered by the same mechanism into the cytosol as C2I, which also depends on Hsp90 for effective transport of active enzyme component into the cytosol. Effects of Inhibitors of Hsp90 on Binding, Endocytosis, and Pore Formation of C2 Toxin—To elucidate the mechanisms underlying the inhibition of the cytotoxic action of C2 toxin by Hsp90, we studied the influence of geldanamycin pretreatment on various steps of the cellular uptake of C2 toxin. We tested whether geldanamycin influenced (i) binding of C2 toxin, (ii) endocytosis, (iii) pore formation of C2IIa, and/or (iv) the C2IIa-mediated translocation of C2I across the cell membrane. First we used flow cytometry to analyze binding of fluorescently labeled C2I (C2I-Alexa-488) to C2IIa on Vero cells (21Barth H. Roebling R. Fritz M. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5074-5081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Cells were treated with geldanamycin (10 μm) for 1 h at 37 °C and subsequently incubated at 4 °C with C2IIa plus C2I-Alexa-488. Under these conditions, geldanamycin did not decrease the binding of C2 toxin to the cells (Fig. 4A). To test whether geldanamycin blocked endocytotic mechanisms in general, Vero cells were treated with geldanamycin (10 μm) for 1 h, and thereafter, C. difficile toxin B was added. Toxin B inactivates small GTPases of the Rho family by glucosylation and is taken up into cells by a similar pathway as C2 toxin (i.e. the toxin is endocytosed and translocated from the acidic endosomal compartment into the cytosol) (24Barth H. Pfeifer G. Hofmann F. Maier E. Benz R. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10670-10676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Neither geldanamycin (10 μm) nor radicicol (1 μm), alone or in combination, inhibited intoxication of cells with C. difficile toxin B (not shown). These findings suggest that the Hsp90 inhibitors did not block the uptake of toxins by general inhibition of endocytosis. Next, we focused on the role of C2IIa and Hsp90 in translocation of C2I from acidic endosomes into the cytosol of cells. To address whether C2IIa pores are directly involved in translocation of C2I across the endosomal membrane, we mimicked the conditions of the acidic endosomes on the surface of intact cells. Recently, we reported that an acidic pulse on the cell surface initiates uptake of C2I into the cytosol of target cells in the presence of C2IIa (10Barth H. Blöcker D. Behlke J. Bergsma-Schutter W. Brisson A. Benz R. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18704-18711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). We found that C2IIa forms pores in membranes of intact cells and that these pores interact with C2I.2 We used a radioactive assay to identify C2IIa pores in cell membranes. CHO cell monolayers were preloaded with 86Rb+, C2IIa was bound to the cells at 4 °C, and the cells were exposed subsequently to an acidic pulse at 37 °C. Pore formation was detected by the release of 86Rb+ into the medium. To test whether Hsp90 was necessary for correct insertion of C2IIa pores into the cell membrane, the effect of geldanamycin on 86Rb+ release from CHO cells was measured. CHO cell monolayers were preloaded with 86Rb+ and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with geldanamycin (10 μm). Subsequently, C2IIa was allowed to bind at 4 °C, and the cells were then exposed to an acidic pulse (pH 4.5, 5 min) at 37 °C. After an additional incubation for 30 min at 4 °C, the release of 86Rb+ was determined. Geldanamycin did not reduce the efflux of 86Rb+ from the cells (Fig. 4B). To exclude the possibility that proteolytic degradation of C2I is involved in the protective effect of the Hsp90 inhibitors, we tested the effect of the proteasome inhibitor MG-132. Vero cells were preincubated for 1 h with MG-132 (MG, 30 μm), and subsequently geldanamycin (1 μm) or radicicol (1 μm) was added for an additional hour. Then C2 toxin was added, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C in the presence of the inhibitors. After 3 h of toxin treatment pictures were taken. MG-132 did not prevent the effects of Hsp90 inhibitors (Fig. 5). Inhibition of Hsp90 Blocks Translocation of Active C2I ADP-ribosyltransferase into the Cytosol—If C2I is partially unfolded during translocation through the C2IIa pore, Hsp90 might be essential for proper folding and recovery of enzyme activity of C2I in the cytosol. We tested whether pretreatment of cells with geldanamycin influenced the direct delivery of C2I via C2IIa across the cell membrane induced by an extracellular acidic pulse. For these experiments, cells were preincubated with bafilomycin to block normal uptake of C2 toxin. Cells were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with C2 toxin in the presence of the inhibitors to allow binding of the toxin on the cell surface. The cells were then shifted to warm acidic medium (pH 4.5, 37 °C) to induce insertion of C2IIa pores into cell membranes and to allow C2IIa-mediated translocation of C2I into the cytosol. After 5 min, the acidic medium was replaced with neutral medium (37 °C, containing bafilomycin A1 (Baf) and geldanamycin (GA), and cells were further incubated at 37 °C. After 2–4 h, fewer cells exhibited C2 toxin-induced cell rounding when they were treated with geldanamycin compared with control cells (Fig. 6A). Fig. 6B shows the percentage of round cells obtained from these experiments. Next, we made use of the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of C2I to determine whether less active enzyme was delivered into the cytosol after treatment with inhibitors of Hsp90. After toxin binding and acidic pulse, lysates of Vero cells that were treated with C2 toxin (in the presence or absence of Hsp90 inhibitor) were analyzed by sequential ADP-ribosylation of actin. In this assay, only actin, which was not ADP-ribosylated by C2 toxin in intact cells, served as a substrate for in vitro ADP-ribosylation with [32P]NAD as a cosubstrate. Radiolabeled (i.e. ADP-ribosylated) actin was determined by autoradiography. More [32P]ADP-ribosylated actin was detected when cells were pretreated with geldanamycin (10 μm) or radicicol (1 μm) (Fig. 6C). These results indicated that Hsp90 inhibitors decreased C2IIa-mediated delivery of active C2I ADP-ribosyltransferase from the cell surface into the cytosol directly across cell membranes induced by an extracellular acidic pulse. Inhibitors of Hsp90 Prevent Translocation of C2I into the Cytosol—For intracellular detection of C2I by confocal microscopy, we used rat astrocytes because these cells are larger and show a clearer distribution of cell compartments than Vero cells. When rat astrocytes were treated with C2 toxin (50 ng/ml C2I and 100 ng/ml C2IIa) for 6 h, cells rounded up, and the actin cytoskeleton was destroyed (Fig. 7A). When cells were pretreated for 1 h with geldanamycin (1 μm) or radicicol (1 μm) before C2 toxin addition, cell rounding was blocked (data not shown). As was shown for Vero cells, geldanamycin or radicicol did not block C2 toxin action completely but delayed intoxication of the rat astrocytes. Next, astrocytes were treated with C2 toxin (50 ng/ml C2I and 100 ng/ml C2IIa) for 2, 4, or 6 h and stained with an antibody against C2I. We detected the C2I toxin in endosomal-like compartments after 2 h. These compartments fused after 4 h, and a clearly detectable, diffuse cytosolic localization of C2I was observed by 6 h (arrow in Fig. 7B). Because of the destruction of the actin cytoskeleton by C2 toxin, the endosomes fused more easily than in th"

Here, we demonstrate the existence of a tachylectin-related protein in the demosponge Suberites domuncula, termed Suberites lectin. The MAPK pathway was activated in response to lipopolysaccharide treatment of the three-dimensional cell aggregates, the primmorphs; this process was abolished by the monosaccharide d-GlcNAc. The cDNA encoding the S. domuncula lectin was identified and cloned; it comprises 238 amino acids (26 kDa) in the open reading frame. The deduced protein has one potential transmembrane region, three characteristic Cys residues, and six internal tandem repeats; it shares the highest sequence similarity with lectins from the horseshoe crab Tachypleus trunculus. The steady-state level of expression of the Suberites lectin rises in primmorphs in response to lipopolysaccharide, an effect that was prevented by co-incubation with d-GlcNAc. The natural sponge lectin was purified by affinity chromatography; it has a size of 27 kDa and displays antibacterial activity against the Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli and the Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus. The putative protein, deduced from the cloned gene, is identical/similar to the purified natural protein, as demonstrated by immunological cross-reactivity with specific antibodies. We conclude that the S. domuncula lectin acts as an antibacterial molecule involved in immune defense against bacterial invaders.

Sponges (phylum Porifera) are marine sessile filter feeders that filtrate huge amounts of water (0.002–0.84 ml/s/cm3 of sponge tissue) through their aquiferous canal system to extract edible material (see Refs. 1Vogel S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 2069-2071Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar and 2Osinga R. Belarbi E.H. Grima E.M. Tramper J. Wijffels R.H. J. Biotechnol. 2003; 100: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Hence, these animals are exposed to large amounts of bacteria and also viruses that are present in seawater (see Ref. 3Gonzales J.M. Moran M.A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 4237-4242Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sponges have developed several strategies to cope with these threats. First, they possess an efficient chemical defense system to inhibit bacterial growth (see Ref. 4Proksch P. Toxicon. 1994; 32: 639-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Triggered by ecological constraints, Porifera developed a large variety of biologically highly active compounds (5Sarma A.S. Daum T. Müller W.E.G. Secondary Metabolites from Marine Sponges. Ullstein-Mosby Verlag, Berlin1993Google Scholar) that were shaped during the last 1 billion years for optimal specificity and activity. Second, sponges are provided with efficient humoral and cellular defense/immune mechanisms that share, at the sequence level, surprisingly high similarity with the immune molecules found in humans (6Müller W.E.G. Blumbach B. Müller I.M. Transplantation. 1999; 68: 1215-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Third, a mechanism in these animals eliminates microorganisms by engulfing them through phagocytosis (reviewed in Ref. 7Wilkinson C.R. Reisser W. Algae and Symbioses: Plants, Animals, Fungi, Viruses, Interactions Explored. Biopress Ltd., Bristol, United Kingdom1992: 111-151Google Scholar). An early illustration and functional analysis of phagocytosis in sponges were given by Metchnikoff (8Metchnikoff É. Leçons sur la Pathologie Comparée de Inflammation. G. Masson, Paris1892Google Scholar). Molecular data indicate that receptors present on the cell surface might have the capacity to discriminate between self-self and non-self (6Müller W.E.G. Blumbach B. Müller I.M. Transplantation. 1999; 68: 1215-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar); examples are receptors that comprise both SRCR (scavenger receptor comprising cysteine-rich) group A domains (9Blumbach B. Pancer Z. Diehl-Seifert B. Steffen R. Münkner J. Müller I. Müller W.E.G. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2635-2644PubMed Google Scholar) and/or SRCR group B domains (10Pahler S. Blumbach B. Müller I. Müller W.E.G. J. Exp. Zool. 1998; 282: 332-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In addition, sponges are very rich in lysosomal enzymes, e.g. cathepsins (11Krasko A. Gamulin V. Seack J. Steffen R. Schröder H.C. Müller W.E.G. Mol. Mar. Biol. Biotechnol. 1997; 6: 296-307PubMed Google Scholar). Lately, our research has focused on those molecules that are involved in the recognition of bacteria and in the intracellular signaling pathway(s) activated after interaction of sponge cells with microorganisms. The search for the kinase pathways that are activated in response to bacterial infection was already successful. It has been demonstrated that, after bacterial infections or after addition of the model molecule for bacterial infection (lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 1The abbreviations used are: LPS, lipopolysaccharide; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; GBP, galactose-binding protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase.1The abbreviations used are: LPS, lipopolysaccharide; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; GBP, galactose-binding protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase.), the phosphorylation of the two MAPKs p38 and JNK strongly increases (12Böhm M. Hentschel U. Friedrich A. Fieseler L. Steffen R. Gamulin V. Müller I.M. Müller W.E.G. Mar. Biol. 2001; 139: 1037-1045Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Hence, it can be deduced that sponges react upon ligation to LPS/bacteria with activation of p38 and JNK MAPKs. One goal of this study was to identify the potential receptor for bacteria on the surface of the sponge cells. The model system for bacterial infection in sponge, LPS-induced activation of the p38 kinase in primmorphs, was used. For this study, the demosponge Suberites domuncula was selected because a cell culture system has been established in this species (13Custodio M.R. Prokic I. Steffen R. Koziol C. Borojevic R. Brümmer F. Nickel M. Müller W.E.G. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1998; 105: 45-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 14Müller W.E.G. Wiens M. Batel R. Steffen R. Borojevic R. Custodio M.R. Mar. Ecol. Prog. Ser. 1999; 178: 205-219Crossref Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Primmorphs are a special form of three-dimensional cell aggregates that contain both proliferating and differentiating cells. The spherical aggregates comprise, in the center, non-differentiated archaeocytes and, on the surface, in the pinacoderm, a layer of differentiated cells, the pinacocytes. Based on the functional analogy to the host defense lectins from the horseshoe crab Tachypleus tridentatus, we screened for a related molecule in S. domuncula. In T. tridentatus, a series of non-self-recognizing lectins have been described that were termed tachylectins or Tachypleus plasma lectins (see Ref. 15Kawabata S.I. Osaki T. Iwanaga S. Ezekowitz R.A.B. Hoffmann J.A. Innate Immunity. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2003: 109-125Google Scholar). A related molecule was cloned from the sponge cDNA library. The deduced protein shares high sequence similarity with the crab polypeptides, especially with the galactose-binding protein (GBP) from T. tridentatus (16Chen S.C. Yen C.H. Yeh M.S. Huang C.J. Liu T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9631-9639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar); the S. domuncula molecule was named LEC_SUBDO. Based on the functional studies described here, we proposed that the S. domuncula lectin is also involved in non-self recognition. Chemicals and Enzymes—The sources of chemicals and enzymes used were given previously (17Kruse M. Müller I.M. Müller W.E.G. Mol. Biol.

Biochem. 1999; 178: 156-165Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). LPS from Escherichia coli O55:B5 and the sugars were from Sigma (Deisenhofen, Germany). The antibody directed against phospho-p38 MAPK (which recognizes the phosphorylated Thr180 and Tyr182 residues) and that against p38 MAPK (which recognizes the total p38 kinase) were obtained from New England Biolabs Inc. (Beverly, MA). Sponges and Primmorphs—Live specimens of S. domuncula (Porifera, Demospongiae, Hadromerida) were collected near Rovinj, Croatia. The sponges were kept in Mainz, Germany, for >4 months prior to the experiments. Where indicated, specimens were analyzed immediately after collection. The procedure for the formation of primmorphs from single cells was applied as described previously (13Custodio M.R. Prokic I. Steffen R. Koziol C. Borojevic R. Brümmer F. Nickel M. Müller W.E.G. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1998; 105: 45-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 14Müller W.E.G. Wiens M. Batel R. Steffen R. Borojevic R. Custodio M.R. Mar. Ecol. Prog. Ser. 1999; 178: 205-219Crossref Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Starting from single cells, primmorphs of 3–7 mm are formed after 5 days. For the experiments, 7-day-old primmorphs were used. They were cultivated in natural seawater supplemented with 0.2% RPMI 1640 medium. Competition Experiments with LPS/ d-GlcNAc—The primmorphs were treated with 10 μg/ml LPS for 12 h in the absence or presence of monosaccharides. After incubation, the primmorphs were immediately processed for Western blot analysis. Samples were homogenized in lysis buffer (1× Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm NaF, protease inhibitor mixture (one tablet/10 ml; Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany), and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate) and centrifuged, and the supernatants were subjected to SDS-PAGE. The protein concentration in the samples was determined (19Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and adjusted to 2 mg/ml. Total cell extracts (10 μg/lane) were subjected to electrophoresis on 12% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.1% SDS as described (12Böhm M. Hentschel U. Friedrich A. Fieseler L. Steffen R. Gamulin V. Müller I.M. Müller W.E.G. Mar. Biol. 2001; 139: 1037-1045Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Western blot experiments were performed using anti-human phospho-p38 antibody (1:2000 dilution) and anti-p38 MAPK antibody (1:2000). After incubation, the blots were incubated with peroxidase-coupled secondary IgG (1:10,000 dilution). Detection of the immunocomplex was carried out using the BM chemiluminescence blotting substrate kit (Roche Applied Science). Isolation of the cDNA for the Suberites Lectin (LEC_SUBDO)—The cDNA encoding the potential LEC_SUBDO protein from S. domuncula was isolated from the cDNA library (17Kruse M. Müller I.M.

Primers were designed based on two highly conserved regions within T. tridentatus GBP (GenBank™/EBI Data Bank accession number AAF74773.1) (16Chen S.C. Yen C.H. Yeh M.S. Huang C.J. Liu T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9631-9639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) at amino acids 78–86 and 108–124. PCR was carried out by an initial denaturation at 95 °C for 4 min, followed by 30 amplification cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 45 s, and 70 °C for 1.5 min and a final extension step at 70 °C for 10 min. The reaction mixture was as described previously (20Wiens M. Koziol C. Hassanein H.M.A. Batel R. Müller W.E.G. Mar. Ecol. Prog. Ser. 1998; 165: 247-257Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The fragments obtained were used to isolate the cDNA from the library (21Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Smith J.A. Seidmann J.G. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology.

Phylogenetic trees were constructed on the basis of amino acid sequence alignments by neighbor joining as implemented in the Neighbor program from the PHYLIP package (25Felsenstein, J. (1993) PHYLIP, Version 3.5, University of Washington, SeattleGoogle Scholar). The distance matrices were calculated using the Dayhoff PAM matrix model as described (26Dayhoff M.O. Schwartz R.M. Orcutt B.C. Dayhoff M.O. Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure. National Biomedical Research Foundation, Washington, D. C.1978: 345-352Google Scholar). The degree of support for internal branches was further assessed by bootstrapping (25Felsenstein, J. (1993) PHYLIP, Version 3.5, University of Washington, SeattleGoogle Scholar). The graphic presentations were prepared with GeneDoc. 4Available at cris.com/~ketchup/genedoc.shtml. Recombinant LEC_SUBDO—The SDLEC sequence, which was used for expression in E. coli, was isolated by PCR using forward primer f1 (5′-GATATCAATTTCAACAGATAAGCAGAGATATG-3′, with the EcoRV restriction site underlined, nucleotides 67–93) and reverse primer r1 (5′-CTCGAGATTTAAGCTCCGATAACATGTCGGAATGT-3′, with the XhoI restriction site underlined, nucleotides 730 to 703). The length of the PCR product was 663 bp; it was used for expression in E. coli. The PCR product was inserted into the bacterial glutathione S-transferase (GST)/oligohistidine/S expression vector pET41a (Novagen, Madison, WI) via the EcoRV (5′-end) and XhoI (3′-end) restriction sites. E. coli strain BL21 was transformed with this plasmid, and expression of the fusion protein was induced for 3 and 6 h at 37 °C with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (21Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Smith J.A. Seidmann J.G. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995Google Scholar). Bacteria from 500-ml cultures were obtained by centrifugation; the fusion protein was extracted and purified first using a His tag purification kit (Novagen) and subsequently with a GST tag purification kit (Amersham Biosciences, Freiburg, Germany) as recommended by the manufacturers. The fusion protein was then cleaved with the recombinant enterokinase (5 units; Novagen) as recommended. The recombinant LEC_SUBDO molecule (tag-free) was purified in a batch procedure using the GST tag purification kit; recombinant LEC_SUBDO remained in the supernatant. Purified recombinant LEC_SUBDO was subjected to a refolding procedure using a protein refolding kit (Novagen). The protein was dialyzed against 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.2) supplemented with 10 mm dl-dithiothreitol. The purity of the material was checked on 10% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.1% SDS according to Laemmli (27Schütze J. Skorokhod A. Müller I.M. Müller W.E.G. J. Mol. Evol. 2001; 53: 402-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). RNA Preparation and Expression Studies in Intact Specimens—RNA was extracted from liquid nitrogen-pulverized primmorphs with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription-PCR was then performed as follows using commercial components (Invitrogen). cDNA was prepared using 10× PCR buffer, MgCl2, dNTP mixture, dithiothreitol, Super-Script reverse transcriptase, and oligo(dT) as described in the Invitrogen protocol. RNA was digested with RNase, and a cDNA segment was amplified (initial denaturation at 95 °C for 3 min, followed by 35 amplification cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 54 °C for 45 s, and 61 °C for 1.5 min and a final extension step at 74 °C for 10 min) with the following two primer pairs: first, with fe1 (5′-TGGCCAATTTCAACAGATAAGC-3′, nucleotides 63–84) and re1 (5′-TATCTCACATGTTTACGGTTCTCAG-3′, nucleotides 853 to 829); and second, with fe2 (5′-AGGCCCTGCAACGGTAAGTG-3′, nucleotides 163–182) and re2 (5′-TGCCCTCCATCTGTTCCCATTCT-3′, nucleotides 649–627). The size of the product obtained with primers fe1 and re1 was 791 bp, and the size of the product obtained with primers fe2 and re2 was 487 bp. The products were size-separated on agarose, followed by staining with ethidium bromide. Expression of SDLEC Analyzed by Northern Blotting—Primmorphs were incubated either in the absence or presence of 10 μg/ml LPS for 0–36 h. In one series of experiments, the assay with LPS contained also 10 mm d-GlcNAc. RNA was extracted, and 5 μg of total RNA was electrophoresed through a 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel and blotted onto a Hybond-Nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences, Little Chal-font, Buckinghamshire, UK) following the manufacturer's instructions (20Wiens M. Koziol C. Hassanein H.M.A. Batel R. Müller W.E.G. Mar. Ecol. Prog. Ser. 1998; 165: 247-257Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Hybridization was performed with a 600-bp part of the corresponding SDLEC cDNA. The probe was labeled with the PCR digoxigenin probe synthesis kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the instruction manual. After washing, digoxigenin-labeled nucleic acid was detected with anti-digoxigenin Fab fragments (conjugated to alkaline phosphatase; 1:10,000 dilution) and visualized by the chemiluminescence technique using CDP according to the instructions of Roche. The screens were scanned with a Bio-Rad GS-525 molecular imager. Purification of LEC_SUBDO—The procedure recently described for GBPs in plasma from Tachypleus trunculus (16Chen S.C. Yen C.H. Yeh M.S. Huang C.J. Liu T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9631-9639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) was applied with modifications. 200 g of S. domuncula tissue was used for the procedure immediately after collection. The material was homogenized in 3 volumes of buffer A (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 2 m NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, and 1% (v/v) Triton X-100) and stirred overnight at 4 °C. The debris was then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was collected. The supernatant was brought to 0.70 saturation with solid ammonium sulfate under stirring. After 12 h, a precipitate was formed, which was collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min. The pellet was dissolved in 30 ml of buffer B (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 0.2 m NaCl, and 10 mm CaCl2) and dialyzed exhaustively overnight against the same buffer. Finally, the fraction was loaded onto an LPS-Sepharose CL-4B column. This matrix was prepared from LPS and CNBractivated Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Biosciences) as recommended in the instruction manual. A column (2 × 10 cm) was prepared and equilibrated with buffer B, and the sample (20 ml) was loaded onto the column. After washing the column with buffer B, the lectin was eluted from the LPS matrix with buffer C (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 2 m NaCl, 20 mm EDTA, and 100 mm d-GlcNAc). Fractions of 2 ml were collected, and the pooled fractions (fractions 66–68) were dialyzed against Ca2+-and Mg2+-free artificial seawater (29Rottmann M. Schröder H.C. Gramzow M. Renneisen K. Kurelec B. Dorn A. Friese U. Müller W.E.G. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3939-3944Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Antibacterial Activity—The assay was performed as described (30Tunkijjanukij S. Olafsen J.A. Dev. Comp. Immunol. 1998; 22: 139-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). E. coli strain BL21 was grown in LB broth overnight. 20 μl of bacterial suspension was added to 80 μl of lectin (either the recombinant or the natural protein) and incubated for 60 min at room temperature. The lectin samples were dialyzed against Ca2+- and Mg2+-free artificial seawater. Antibacterial activity was assayed, and the reduction of colony-forming units was determined after serial dilution of the assay samples and overnight incubation. The percent inhibition was calculated as follows: (number of control and test colonies/number of control colonies) × 100 (n = 5). In one series of experiments, the lectin samples (100 μg/ml) were preincubated with LPS (10 μg/ml) for 12 h at 4 °C and then applied. Antibodies against LEC_SUBDO—Polyclonal antibodies were raised against the recombinant lectin in New Zealand White female rabbits as described (31Schütze J. Krasko A. Diehl-Seifert B. Müller W.E.G. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3189-3198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In 4-weeks intervals, three boosts (10 μg of protein each) were injected. The serum was collected, and the polyclonal antibodies were termed pAb-LEC_SUBDO. In control experiments, 100 μl of pAb-LEC_SUBDO was adsorbed to 20 μg of recombinant lectin (30 min, 4 °C) prior to use. Inhibition of LEC_SUBDO-LPS Interaction Using an Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay System—Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were performed at 20 °C as described (32Wagner-Hülsmann C. Bachinski N. Diehl-Seifert B. Blumbach B. Steffen R. Pancer Z. Müller W.E.G. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 785-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). 96-well polystyrene plates were coated with LPS (10 μg/ml) and incubated for 5 h. Excess protein-binding sites on the microtiter plates were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin and washed three times. The wells were incubated with increasing concentrations of d-GlcNAc together with 10 μg/ml natural S. domuncula LEC_SUBDO. After an additional wash, the wells were incubated with pAb-LEC_SUBDO (1:500 dilution) for 30 min. The immunocomplexes were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies (1:1000) under application of o-phenylenediamine as substrate. The plates were read at 492 nm. The minimal inhibitory concentration of d-GlcNAc was determined. Western Blotting—Gel electrophoresis of the protein extracts was performed on 10 or 15% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.1% SDS according to Laemmli (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Protein samples were subjected to gel electrophoresis in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Semidry electrotransfer was performed according to Kyhse-Andersen (33Kyhse-Andersen J. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1984; 10: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (2145) Google Scholar) onto Immobilon membranes (polyvinylidene difluoride). Membranes were processed (34Bachmann M. Mayet W.J. Schröder H.C. Pfeifer K. Meyer zum Büschenfelde K.-H. Müller W.E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7770-7774Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and incubated with pAb-LEC_SUBDO (1:500 dilution) for 90 min at room temperature. After blocking the membranes with 5% bovine serum albumin, the immunocomplexes were visualized by incubation with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG, followed by staining with 4-chloro-1-naphthol. Competitive Effect of d-GlcNAc on p38 Kinase Phosphorylation—In a previous study, it was documented that the p38 kinase undergoes phosphorylation after incubation of sponge cells (in the primmorph system) in the presence of LPS (12Böhm M. Hentschel U. Friedrich A. Fieseler L. Steffen R. Gamulin V. Müller I.M. Müller W.E.G. Mar. Biol. 2001; 139: 1037-1045Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Consequently, the primmorphs were incubated also in this study in the absence or presence of 10 μg/ml LPS as described under “Materials and Methods.” To clarify whether monosaccharides modulate the extent of phosphorylation, the compounds d-Glc, d-Gal, d-GalNAc, d-GlcNAc, d-GlcNH2, and d-GalNH2 were added to the assays at a final concentration of 10 mm. Extracts were prepared and subjected at identical concentrations to SDS-PAGE. Western blotting was performed either with anti-p38 MAPK antibody (phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated) or with anti-phospho-p38 MAPK antibody. The blots show that the total amount of p38 remained unchanged irrespective of incubation with LPS alone or with the respective sugar (Fig. 1, upper panels). In contrast, when the primmorphs were incubated with LPS, a strong increase in the phosphorylation of the kinase was seen (Fig. 1, lower panels). In the absence of LPS, no immunoreaction occurred with anti-phospho-p38 antibody. A strong reduction of p38 phosphorylation could be recorded only in the presence of d-GlcNAc among the different monosaccharides tested (Fig. 1); no effect was seen in the assays with d-Gal and d-GalNAc (Fig. 1) and d-Glc, d-GlcNH2, and d-GalNH2 (data not shown). From these results, we draw the conclusion that the interaction between LPS and the primmorphs occurs via a lectin-related reaction. Cloning of the cDNA Encoding the S. domuncula Lectin— The S. domuncula lectin protein (LEC_SUBDO) was obtained from the cDNA library by PCR cloning as described under “Materials and Methods.” The cDNA obtained (SDLEC) comprises an open reading frame that ranges from nucleotides 15/17 to 729/731 (stop codon). The deduced protein, termed LEC_SUBDO, comprises 238 amino acids residues with a calculated size of 25,908 Da. A potential transmembrane region was identified (35Rao J. Argos P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 869: 197-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar) ranging from amino acids 1 to 18 (Fig. 2A). Three disulfide linkages have been assigned for the most closely related protein, T. tridentatus lectin L6 (36Saito T. Kawabata S. Hirata M. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14493-14499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The respective Cys residues exist in the S. domuncula sequence at identical positions; the first disulfide bridge is located between Cys49 and Cys53, the second between Cys124 and Cys128, and the third between Cys200 and Cys204. As for T. tridentatus lectin L6, the characteristic feature of the six internal tandem repeats (36Saito T. Kawabata S. Hirata M. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14493-14499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) is also found in the sponge molecule. They range in S. domuncula LEC_SUBDO from amino acids 19 to 55 (repeat 1), 56 to 90 (repeat 2), 91 to 129 (repeat 3), 130 to 166 (repeat 4), 167 to 205 (repeat 5), and 206 to 236 (repeat 6) (Fig. 2A). Phylogenetic Analysis—The sponge LEC_SUBDO polypeptide shares the highest sequence similarity with the lectins from the horseshoe crab T. tridentatus. These lectins (tachylectin-P, lectin L6, and tachylectin-1) show ∼50% amino acid identity and 65% amino acid similarity (with respect to the physicochemical properties) to sponge LEC_SUBDO. The similarity is lower to the deuterostomian sequences from the fish Carassius auratus putative membrane protein and the potential GBP from Danio rerio (22% identity and 40% similarity) as well as to the two tectonins from the Mycetozoa Physarum polycephalum (20% identity and 38% similarity). There is no considerable similarity to the protostomian/nematode putative proteins in the data base. This relationship is also reflected by the phylogenetic tree, which was rooted with one predicted open reading frame from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This tree shows that the S. domuncula protein clusters with the tachylectins (see Ref. 37Kawabata S. Beisel H.G. Huber R. Bode W. Gokudan S. Muta T. Tsuda R. Koori K. Kawahara T. Seki N. Mizunoe Y.

In 1998, genetic analyses revealed a direct linkage between structural and regulatory mutations in the tau gene and the neurodegenerative disease, frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17). Importantly, the FTDP-17 phenotype is transmitted in a dominant rather than a recessive manner. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms causing disease remain uncertain. The most common molecular mechanism generating dominant phenotypes is the loss of function of a multimeric complex containing both mutant and wild-type subunits. Therefore, we sought to determine whether tau might normally function as a multimer. We co-incubated 35S-radiolabeled tau and biotinylated tau with taxol stabilized microtubules, at very low molar ratios of tau to tubulin. Subsequent covalent cross-linking followed by affinity-precipitation of the biotinylated tau revealed the formation of microtubule-dependent tau oligomers. We next used atomic force microscopy to independently assess this conclusion. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that tau forms oligomers upon binding to microtubules. In addition to providing insights into normal tau action, our findings lead us to propose that one mechanism by which mutations in tau may cause cell death is through the formation of tau complexes containing mutant tau molecules in association with wild-type tau. These wild-type-mutant tau complexes may possess altered biological and/or biophysical properties that promote onset of the FTDP-17 phenotype, including neuronal cell death by either altering normal tau-mediated regulation of microtubule-dependent cellular functions and/or promoting the formation of pathological tau aggregates.

The microtubule-associated protein tau, localized predominantly in the cell bodies and axons of neuronal cells, is necessary for the establishment of neuronal cell polarity and axon outgrowth, for axonal transport, and the maintenance of axonal morphology (for example, see Refs. 1Esmaeli-Azad B.

Mechanistically, tau is well known to stimulate MT 1The abbreviations used are: MT, microtubule; AFM, atomic force microscopy; EDC, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide; FTDP-17, frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; MAP, microtubule-associated protein; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid.1The abbreviations used are: MT, microtubule; AFM, atomic force microscopy; EDC, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide; FTDP-17, frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; MAP, microtubule-associated protein; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. polymerization, to stabilize MTs, and to modulate MT dynamics (9Fellous A.

Since MT dynamics must be tightly regulated for cells to function and remain viable (e.g. see Refs. 13Goncalves A. Braguer D. Kamath K. Martello L. Briand C. Horwitz S. Wilson L. Jordan M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11737-11742Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar and 14Yvon A.M. Wadsworth P. Jordan M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 947-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar), it follows that tau action must also be finely regulated in cells. Alternatively, abnormal tau behavior is often associated with neurodegenerative diseases. In Alzheimer's disease, FTDP-17 and a large number of additional “tauopathies,” necrotic neurons possess abnormal pathological fibers composed primarily of hyperphosphorylated and dysfunctional tau (for a recent review, see Ref. 15Lee V.M. Goedert M. Trojanowski J.Q. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1121-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (2112) Google Scholar). Until recently, the relationship between tau and these various diseases was only correlative. However, in 1998, several groups reported a direct genetic linkage between mutations in the tau gene and FTDP-17, a group of related neurodegenerative conditions characterized by neuronal cell death and dementia accompanied by abnormal tau fiber pathology (16Hutton M.

Although some of the tau mutations are structural and others are regulatory, all exhibit dominant phenotypes. Thus, both dysfunction and misregulation of tau are causally related to neuronal cell death, neurodegenerative disease, and dementia. While there is only a single tau gene, alternative splicing of tau mRNA produces two classes of tau proteins known as “3-repeat tau” and “4-repeat tau” (20Himmler A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1389-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 21Himmler A. Drechsel D. Kirschner M.W. Martin Jr., D.W. Mol. Cell.

The FTDP-17 mutations introduce amino acid substitutions in or near to the MT binding domain or alter the pattern of tau RNA splicing without altering the primary sequence of the encoded tau protein (16Hutton M.

Although the genetic linkage between tau mutations and FTDP-17 establishes a clear cause-and-effect relationship between tau dysfunction/misregulation and neuronal cell death and dementia, the underlying molecular mechanism leading to dementia and neuronal cell death is not understood. In line with the growing number of dominantly inherited degenerative diseases involving abnormal protein folding (28Taylor J.P. Hardy J. Fischbeck K.H. Science. 2002; 296: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar), a number of investigators have suggested a “gain-of-a-toxic-function” mechanism in which the mutations confer upon tau an increased probability of forming abnormal tau fibers, which are in turn toxic to the cells (29Gamblin T.C. King M.E. Dawson H. Vitek M.P. Kuret J. Berry R.W. Binder L.I. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6136-6144Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 30Goedert M. Jakes R. Crowther R.A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 450: 306-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). However, while this is a plausible model for FTDP-17 mutations that alter the tau amino acid sequence, it is less obvious what toxic function might be acquired by the tau RNA splicing mutations in which only the 3-repeat to 4-repeat ratio of otherwise wild-type proteins is affected. An alternative to the gain-of-a-toxic function model is a loss-of-function model. Indeed, the most common molecular mechanism underlying dominant mutations is poisoning of, or otherwise altering the properties of, an oligomeric complex that is essential for cell viability. In the case of tau, if proper tau function were to require oligomerization, perhaps oligomers containing mutant tau polypeptides harboring amino acid substitutions or an altered ratio of wild-type tau isoforms alter function sufficiently to cause cell death. Here, we employed two independent assays to test the hypothesis that tau oligomerization may be a part of normal tau action. A biochemical assay demonstrates that, even at very low tau:tubulin molar ratios, tau-tau dimers (and potentially larger oligomers) form in a microtubule dependent manner. Second, AFM visualization of tau alone, tau and microtubules at a low tau:tubulin molar ratio, and tau and MTs at a saturating tau:tubulin ratio support the conclusion that tau oligomerizes in a microtubule dependent manner. These tau oligomers are likely to be important for tau action during normal neuronal development; they also present a molecular mechanism for the tau-mediated cell death in neurodegeneration. Protein Reagents—Full-length rat 4R2N tau cDNA cloned into pET23a was in vitro transcribed and translated (Promega TNT wheat germ lysate kit) using [35S]methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Product yields were determined by percent specific incorporation of radioactivity. Recombinant tau was purified by phosphocellulose chromatography and HPLC (31Chau M.F. Radeke M.J. de Ines C. Barasoain I. Kohlstaedt L.A. Feinstein S.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17692-17703Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Recombinant tau concentrations were determined by comparing to known tau mass standards (established by mass spectroscopy) by quantitative immunoblotting using a tau polyclonal affinity purified antibody directed against full-length 3-repeat tau (pan-tau, a kind gift of Monte Radeke) followed by ECL detection (Pierce). Tau was biotinylated according to the manufacturer's protocol (Pierce) with a 7.5:1 molar ratio of biotin to tau. Briefly a 10 mg/ml working stock of NHS-biotin (Pierce) was prepared in 50 mm Sodium Bicarbonate (pH 8.0) buffer immediately prior to use. Biotin was added to 200 μg of a 5 mg/ml solution of tau (4.43 × 10–6m) at a final concentration of 6.645 × 10–5m biotin. The solution was gently mixed, incubated for 2 h on ice, and free biotin was removed by desalting through a CS-20 column (Princeton Separations, Inc.). Microtubule Polymerization—Taxol stabilized MTs were assembled from MAP-free phosphocellulose-purified bovine tubulin (a kind gift of Dr. Les Wilson and Herb Miller) by incubation at 37 °C in BRB-80 buffer (80 mm Pipes, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgSO4, pH 6.8) in the presence of 1 mm GTP and the stepwise addition of increasing concentrations of taxol (diluted in Me2SO) to a final concentration of 10 μm taxol (Sigma). MT dilutions were made in BRB-80, 1 mm GTP, 10 μm taxol. 1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC) Cross-linking Assays—Tau was incubated either with, or without, taxol-stabilized MTs for 30 min at 37 °C in BRB-80 buffer, 1 mm GTP, 10 μm taxol. EDC (Sigma) was added at the final concentrations indicated (0.1–1.5 mm) in BRB-80 buffer, and the mixture was incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Cross-linking was terminated by the addition of 1 volume of 2× protein sample buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 20% glycerol, 1.4 m β-mercaptoethanol) with or without the addition of 10 mm glycine (as indicated). Samples were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and either directly prepared for autoradiography or transferred to a membrane (nitrocellulose or polyvinylidene difluoride) for immunoblotting prior to autoradiography. Microtubule Assembly Assay—Phosphocellulose-purified tubulin at a final concentration of 2 mg/ml in BRB-80 buffer supplemented with 1 mm GTP was added to varying concentrations of recombinant tau and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, then gently layered over a prewarmed 50% sucrose cushion and ultracentrifuged at 100 kg for 15 min at 25 °C. Pellets and supernatants were recovered and fractionated on SDS-PAGE, Coomassie-stained, and the amount of tubulin and tau in each fraction was determined by comparison to known mass standards. Biotin Pull-down Assay—MT assembly was carried out by two rounds of sequential polymerization. Initially MT seeds were prepared by assembling 10% of the final volume of MAP-free phosphocellulose tubulin in BRB-80 buffer, 1 mm GTP, 10% Me2SO, 10% glycerol at 37 °C for 30 min, followed by shearing. The remaining tubulin was added to the microtubule seed preparation and polymerized under the same buffer and temperature conditions as described previously. MTs were then incubated with 0.1 μm recombinant, HPLC-purified, biotinylated tau for 30 min at 37 °C. EDC cross-linking was carried out as described above and cross-linking was quenched with the addition of a 10-fold molar excess of glycine and the sample denatured by treatment with 1% SDS and heating (two intervals of 2.5 min at 90 °C followed by 2.5 min at room temperature). The samples were then diluted into 10 volumes of binding buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) with 1% Triton X-100 and incubated on ice for 20 min. An excess of Softlink™ monomeric avidin resin (Pierce) was added to each reaction, and the samples were incubated 16 h at 4 °C with tumbling. The avidin beads were extensively washed in binding buffer with 0.1% Triton X-100, and biotinylated tau was eluted at room temperature with 1× protein sample buffer. Atomic Force Microscopy—AFM was performed using a Digital Instruments Multimode Nanoscope III AFM equipped with a D-scanner (15 μm scan size). Tappingmode™ AFM was performed in fluid using a Tappingmode™ Liquid Cell (Digital Instruments) and oxide-sharpened silicon nitride tips (with a spring constant of 0.06 Newton/m (DNPS, Nanoprobes, Digital Instruments). For imaging of individual tau molecules, samples were diluted to 5 ng/ml in BRB-80 buffer containing 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol and incubated for 30 min at room temperature and then adsorbed onto freshly cleaved mica for 5 min at room temperature. Samples were rinsed and imaged in sterile filtered BRB-80 buffer. Taxol-stabilized MTs were prepared for imaging with a prepelleting step of 25 kg, for 6 min, at room temperature; pellets were then washed twice with BRB-80 buffer and gently resuspended in warm filtered BRB-80, 1 mm GTP, 10 μm taxol. Prior to imaging, MT samples were fixed in 0.2% gluteraldehyde (8% stock, Ted Pella) for no less than 10 min to no more than 4 h. 20 μl of the MT samples were then adsorbed onto 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (Sigma) coated mica (freshly prepared by 15 min of vapor deposition) for 15 s, rinsed twice with one ml of BRB-80 buffer, and imaged in sterile filtered buffer. Unless otherwise noted, the AFM data were minimally filtered using a first order flatten and/or a first order planefit function. Sample dimensions were determined from the topography images. The formula for determining the volume (V) of a partial sphere: V = [πh (3r 2 + h 2)]/6 was used to calculate the mean volume of tau monomers from the mean height (h) and apparent diameter (2r) as measured by AFM. To compensate for tip broadening effects, apparent protein diameters were determined at half the maximum height (32Fritzsche W. Vesenka J. Henderson E. Scanning Microsc. 1995; 9: 729-739PubMed Google Scholar). EDC Cross-linking of Tau Bound to Microtubules Leads to the Formation of Microtubule-dependent, Tau-containing Complexes—As a first test of the hypothesis that tau might homooligomerize under normal, non-pathological conditions, we used the zero-length cross-linker EDC to covalently cross-link MTs bound to equilibrium with 4-repeat tau. As seen in Fig. 1A, (lanes 1 and 4) radiolabeled 4-repeat tau migrates as a single major band on SDS-PAGE with an apparent molecular mass of ∼65 kDa. Treatment of tau with 1.5 mm EDC (Fig. 1A, lanes 2 and 5) results in the formation of no new products. However, cross-linking of radiolabeled tau bound to taxol-stabilized MTs (∼3nm tau and 20 μm MTs) leads to the generation of a series of radiolabeled bands between ∼80–160 kDa and of greater than ∼230 kDa (Fig. 1A, lanes 3 and 6). Control reactions in which the non-MT-binding protein luciferase (62 kDa) was substituted for tau exhibited no MT-dependent bands (Fig. 1B), demonstrating the specificity of the MT binding dependent cross-linking events for tau. Tau Binding to Microtubules Leads to Direct Tau-Tau Association—The various MT dependent, cross-linked complexes observed in lanes 3 and 6 of Fig. 1A could be multimers composed either solely of tau or contain both tau and tubulin. To test the hypothesis that MT binding might promote tau-tau intermolecular associations, we developed an assay in which we 1) co-incubated biotinylated tau, radiolabeled tau, and taxol-stabilized MTs, 2) cross-linked with EDC under conditions optimized to maximize the quantity of cross-linked complexes in the region of the gel predicted for tau-tau dimers, and 3) affinity-purified the biotinylated tau with avidin beads. The presence of radiolabeled tau co-precipitating with the biotinylated tau with an apparent size consistent with tau dimers would support the hypothesis that tau multimers form on MTs. As controls, we first established that biotinylation of tau does not affect its functional capability, as assessed by its ability to assemble tubulin into MTs (data not shown). An additional control experiment demonstrated that biotinylated tau bound to MTs produces a similar collection of cross-linked complexes as radiolabeled tau (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 2). This same control experiment further demonstrates that no detectable tubulin-containing cross-linked products form using these low concentrations of EDC (Fig. 2A, lanes 5 and 6), and further, only negligible amounts of tubulin pellet nonspecifically with the biotinylated tau (Fig. 2A, lane 6). Finally, to determine whether MT bound tau might homooligomerize, we conducted the experiment using radiolabeled and biotinylated tau at a tau:tubulin molar ratio of ∼1:200. Both EDC cross-linked and non-cross-linked samples were subjected to avidin affinity precipitation, and the resulting pellets were fractionated by SDS-PAGE. Most importantly, radiolabeled tau migrating in the region of the gel predicted for tau-tau dimers (∼130 kDa) is observed only when radiolabeled tau, EDC, and MTs are present in the reaction (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 9–12). Furthermore, co-migration of biotinylated tau and radiolabeled tau at ∼130 kDa strengthens the conclusion that the band corresponds to a tau-tau dimer (Fig. 2B, lanes 6 and 12). Specificity of the biotinylated tau for radiolabeled tau is demonstrated by the failure of radiolabeled luciferase to cross-link with biotinylated tau (Fig. 2B, lanes 7 and 8). Taken together, the simplest interpretation for the data is that MT binding leads to intermolecular tau-tau association, even at these very low molar ratios of tau to tubulin. AFM Imaging of Highly Purified Tau Reveals Thin, Disk-like Structures—As an independent route to assess the tau-tau and tau-MT interactions, we next employed tapping mode atomic force microscopy. Using this modality, samples can be imaged in fluid, which allows the hydrated topographical conformation to be observed. We first examined highly purified recombinant 4-repeat tau in the absence of microtubules (Fig. 3A). Analysis of the volume distribution (n = 57; see formula under “Materials and Methods”) revealed the presence of two peaks (Fig. 3B). The measured mean width and height, and the calculated mean molecular volume, were found to be 18.6 ± 2.3 nm, 1.27 ± 0.3 nm, and 174 nm3 for the major peak and 24.2 ± 2.2 nm, 1.95 ± 0.3 nm, and 453.5 nm3 for the minor peak. Thus, under these conditions, tau possesses a thin disk-like structure. The major peak contained 85% of the measured tau subunits (n = 49). The simplest interpretation is that the majority of the tau imaged was individual monomers, while only a small proportion (∼15%) was dimeric. AFM Imaging of in Vitro Assembled Microtubules Reveals Individual Subunits—Next, we imaged highly purified tubulin that had been assembled into polymers in the presence of taxol. Fig. 3, C and D, present images of two bundled MTs bifurcating into individual MTs. The image in Fig. 3C shows the topography (height) data; the image in Fig. 3D is the amplitude (error) image for the same sample. From the topography data, we determined that the MT bundle is ∼87 nm in diameter and 20 nm in height. The separated individual MTs are ∼45–47 nm in diameter and have a height of 15.2 and 15.4 nm. The lower than expected height (relative to dimensions observed by electron microscopy (33McEwen B. Edelstein S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 139: 123-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) is likely due to compression of the MTs resulting from tip-sample interactions (34Lal R. John S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C1-C21Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Muller D.J. Engel A. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1633-1644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 36Baumgartner W. Hinterdorfer P. Schindler H. Ultramicroscopy. 2000; 82: 85-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The larger than expected width is likely due to both compression from tip-sample interactions as well as tip broadening effects inherent in AFM imaging (32Fritzsche W. Vesenka J. Henderson E. Scanning Microsc. 1995; 9: 729-739PubMed Google Scholar). In the amplitude image (Fig. 3D), we observed a highly regular array of very small subunits. Since these features are near in size to the sensitivity limit of the AFM feedback mechanism, it would require excessive image processing to enhance these features in the topography image. On the other hand, the small amplitude changes persist in the error mode image. Our interpretation is that this subunit structure reflects the organization of tubulin dimers into longitudinal protofilaments. Given that the MT has a width of ∼46 nm, and that 6 rows of protofilaments are observed, the apparent subunit diameter is ∼7.7 nm. This value is in reasonable agreement with dimensions as assessed by electron crystallography (37Nogales E. Wolf S.G. Downing K.H. Nature. 1998; 391: 199-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (1785) Google Scholar). At a High Tau:Tubulin Ratio, Tau Saturates the Microtubule Surface— Fig. 3, E and F display a MT that has been incubated with saturating levels of tau (∼1 tau per 2 tubulin dimers). The imaged structure is 79 nm in width and 11.1 nm in height. The surface is covered with four rows of subunits. Dividing the width of the structure by the number of rows yields an effective diameter of ∼20 nm per subunit, which is two to three times the size of the tubulin dimers observed in the absence of tau in Fig. 3, C and D, but in good agreement with the dimensions we observed earlier for monomeric tau (Fig. 3A), leading to the conclusion that the entire surface of the MT is coated with tau. Occasional secondary layers of clustered structures were also observed (Fig. 3, E and F). The measured diameter of the clustered subunits in the secondary layer is ∼25–30 nm, and the height may be as much as 5–10 nm, suggesting that these structures may be oligomers composed of stacked tau monomers. At a Low Tau:Tubulin Molar Ratio, Tau Forms Ring-like Oligomers—As a follow up to the biochemical approaches used in Figs. 1 and 2, we next used atomic force microscopy to independently assess whether MT binding might influence tau-tau associations. We imaged MTs bound with a low (1:200) molar ratio of tau to tubulin dimers (Figs. 4, A and B). Given the dimensions previously measured for the unbound tau and undecorated MTs, this molar ratio of tau:tubulin should result in vastly sub-saturating coverage of the MT surface. Under these conditions, we observed that the regular surface of the MT was sometimes modified to include structures that were not seen in the absence of bound tau. These tau-dependent structures can be grouped into two general types. The first group appears as periodic, ring-like structures which span the girth of the MT approximately perpendicular to the long axis (Fig. 4A, arrows). To test the plausibility of the model that the rings are a single layer of tau oligomers encircling the MT, the predicted circumference of such a tau layer (based on the dimensions of tau monomers observed in Fig. 3A) was compared with the observed dimensions.

https://openalex.org/W2027001966,"Telomerase expression is the hallmark of tumor cells in which this ribonucleoprotein complex preserves chromosome integrity by maintaining telomere length and thereby prevents cell death. However, recent data support a role of the combination of p53 and telomerase inactivation in initiating genetic instability that promotes malignant transformation. Through its pleiotropic effects on infected T-cell metabolism, the human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) oncoprotein Tax plays a central role in leukemogenesis. Here, we show that Tax inhibits human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) transcription, which is the rate-limiting factor of telomerase activity. This inhibitory effect, that occurs in competition with c-Myc through a canonical c-Myc binding site within the hTERT promoter, results in a decreased telomerase activity of Tax-expressing cells. This is the first demonstration of hTERT inhibition by an oncogene. Tax, which is only expressed in preleukemic cells, triggers infected T-cell cycle and keeps these cells cycling while inactivating p53. We propose that, in combination with these effects, hTERT repression by Tax at an early phase of carcinogenesis might contribute to the massive ploidy changes associated with the development of HTLV-1-associated malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W2022625436,"Epidemiological evidence suggests that chronic use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) reduces the risk of Alzheimer's disease. Recently, NSAIDs have been shown to decrease amyloid pathology in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. This benefit may be partially attributable to the ability of NSAIDs to selectively reduce production of the amyloidogenic Aβ42 peptide in both cultured cells and transgenic mice. Although this activity does not appear to require the action of cyclooxygenases in cultured cells, it is not known whether other NSAID-sensitive targets contribute to this Aβ42 effect. In this study, we have used both pharmacological and genetic means to determine if other known cellular targets of NSAIDs could mediate the reduction in Aβ42 secretion from cultured cells. We find that altered arachidonic acid metabolism via NSAID action on cyclooxygenases and lipoxygenases does not alter Aβ42 production. Furthermore, we demonstrate that alterations in activity of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, IκB kinase β or nuclear factor κB do not affect Aβ42 production. Thus, NSAIDs do not appear to alter Aβ42 production indirectly through previously identified cellular targets and may interact directly with the γ-secretase complex itself to affect amyloid production.

Safe effective treatments are urgently needed. One hallmark of AD is the accumulation of amyloid β-protein (Aβ), derived from the amyloid precursor protein (APP), in senile plaques in brain. There are two predominant isoforms of Aβ peptide, Aβ40 and Aβ42, differing in their C termini: Aβ42, the longer isoform is more amyloidogenic and toxic to cultured cells. Virtually all mutations associated with familial AD preferentially increase amount of Aβ42 produced, and hence the ratio of Aβ42:Aβ40 (1Selkoe D.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5121) Google Scholar). Thus, decreasing production or increasing the clearance of Aβ42 may be an effective way to either prevent the development of or treat AD.Epidemiological studies demonstrate that persons with a history of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use have a reduced risk of AD (2Zandi P.P. Breitner J.C. Neurobiol. Aging. 2001; 22: 811-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 3Akiyama H. Barger S. Barnum S. Bradt B. Bauer J. Cole G.M. Cooper N.R. Eikelenboom P. Emmerling M.

Aging. 2000; 21: 383-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (3626) Google Scholar). It is generally assumed that the inflammatory responses seen in brains of AD individuals play a key role in neurodegeneration (4Aisen P.S. Davis K.L. Am. J. Psychiatry. 1994; 151: 1105-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 5Aisen P.S. Neurobiol. Aging. 2000; 21: 447-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), but it has not been established that the anti-inflammatory properties of NSAIDs underlie their apparent neuroprotective effects (6Wyss-Coray T. Mucke L. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 973-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 7Golde T.E. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 936-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In line with the epidemiological findings, treatment of APP transgenic mice, which develop Aβ deposits and associated pathology, with these compounds has proven to be beneficial. Specifically, ibuprofen, curcumin, and a nitric oxide derivative of flurbiprofen were recently shown to decrease the formation of amyloid plaques and reduce inflammatory markers in a transgenic mouse model of AD (8Lim G.P. Yang F. Chu T. Chen P. Beech W. Teter B. Tran T. Ubeda O. Ashe K.H. Frautschy S.A. Cole G.M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5709-5714Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Lim G.P. Yang F. Chu T. Gahtan E.

Wallace J.L. Rojiani A.M. Coppola D. Morgan D. Gordon M.N. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 2246-2254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These and other observations have led to a number of clinical trials to determine if NSAIDs or immunosuppression may be useful in the treatment of AD.In our recent studies (11Weggen S. Eriksen J.L. Das P. Sagi S.A. Wang R. Pietrzik C.U. Findlay K.A. Smith T.E. Murphy M.P. Bulter T. Kang D.E. Marquez-Sterling N. Golde T.E. Koo E.H. Nature. 2001; 414: 212-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar) we found that some NSAIDs, including sulindac, ibuprofen, and indomethacin, lowered the levels of the amyloidogenic Aβ42 isoform, hence reducing the ratio of Aβ42:Aβ40, in medium from a variety of cultured cells as well as in brains of APP transgenic mice. The effective NSAIDs did not grossly affect the production or processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). While these NSAIDs decreased the ratio of Aβ42:Aβ40, they appear to increase the production of shorter Aβ peptides, such as Aβ38. This suggested that NSAIDs might subtly alter the production of various Aβ species. To our knowledge, the NSAIDs are the first class of compounds that specifically reduce Aβ42 production without significant alteration in Aβ40 levels.The focus of these studies was to further investigate the cellular mechanisms responsible for the Aβ42:Aβ40 reduction by certain NSAIDs. Our initial report established that inhibition of the cyclooxygenase enzymes COX1 and COX2, the canonical targets of NSAIDs, was not sufficient to reduce the Aβ42 levels (11Weggen S. Eriksen J.L. Das P. Sagi S.A. Wang R. Pietrzik C.U. Findlay K.A. Smith T.E. Murphy M.P. Bulter T. Kang D.E. Marquez-Sterling N. Golde T.E. Koo E.H.

We therefore proposed that NSAIDs affect the amyloid pathology by lowering the amyloidogenic Aβ42 peptide through a COX-independent pathway. This hypothesis is not unparalleled, as a dual-action model has been suggested for the effectiveness of NSAIDs in colorectal cancer studies where both COX-dependent and COX-independent mechanisms have been described. To further understand the mechanism whereby NSAIDs lower Aβ42 levels, we examined whether other NSAID-sensitive targets including arachidonic acid, lipoxygenases, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR), and nuclear factor κB influence the generation of Aβ42 (Fig. 1). In addition, we examined several other compounds that have been reported to lower risk of AD or to reduce amyloid pathology in transgenic mice to determine whether they also have a previously unrecognized activity against Aβ42.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Lines and Culture Conditions—Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably expressing APP751 with or without human presenilin 1 M146L (designated APP-WT and PS1ML, respectively) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) in a 37 °C, humidified incubator with 5% CO2. One day prior to drug treatment cells were plated at ∼1 × 105 cells/ml. Embryonic fibroblasts from wild-type, IKK2 knockout (kindly provided by I. Verma) or p65/RelA knockout (a gift from E. Shaulian) mice were maintained as above. Primary cultures of ALOX5 and ALOX15 knockout fibroblasts were generated from neonatal mice resulting from homozygous ALOX5 or ALOX15 knockout (mice purchased from The Jackson Laboratory) breeding. Fibroblasts were infected with 60 pfu per cell of adenovirus encoding wild-type APP751 for 2 h before treatment with NSAIDs (11Weggen S. Eriksen J.L. Das P. Sagi S.A. Wang R. Pietrzik C.U.

LG10305 and BRL49653 were kind gifts from R. Evans. R-flurbiprofen was supplied by Encore Pharmaceuticals.Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assays—For most experiments human Aβ ELISA were performed as described (12Suzuki N. Cheung T.T. Cai X.D. Odaka A.

For each experiment duplicate or triplicate samples were analyzed. Each drug was tested at several doses in a minimum of two independent experiments with sulindac sulfide as a positive control. Selective reduction in Aβ42 was determined by calculating the Aβ42:Aβ40 ratio for each sample. These ratios were normalized to vehicle control in each experiment. These normalized ratios were pooled and analysis of variance used to determine if the Aβ42:Aβ40 ratio was significantly different from vehicle with p < 0.05. Error bars in figures represent standard errors.Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-Of-Flight Mass Spectrometry—MALDI-TOF was performed on Aβ peptides immunoprecipitated from conditioned medium of CHO cells as described (14Uljon S.N. Mazzarelli L. Chait B.T. Wang R. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 146: 439-452PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Complete protease inhibitor, phosphoramidon and a synthetic Aβ1–22 peptide, that served as an internal control, were added, and all Aβ1-x were immunoprecipitated from conditioned medium by overnight incubation with anti-mouse IgG agarose beads and 26D6, which recognizes the N terminus of Aβ. Extraction from the beads was with formic acid/water/isopropyl alcohol 1:4:4 (v/v/v). Eluted material was mixed 1:1 with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid solution prior to spotting for spectrometry. Spectra shown are representative of at least two experiments performed with duplicate samples. Treatment-induced changes in Aβ species distribution were determined by normalization of peak heights to Aβ40.Bicine/Urea SDS-PAGE and Western Blots—Conditioned medium was immunoprecipitated as for MALDI-TOF analysis, except without the addition of synthetic Aβ22. Bicine/urea gels were performed as described in Wiltfang et al. (15Wiltfang J. Smirnov A. Schnierstein B. Kelemen G. Matthies U. Klafki H.W. Staufenbiel M. Huther G. Ruther E. Kornhuber J. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. The final acrylamide concentration in the separating gel was 10% T, 5% C. The comb gel was eliminated from our protocol. In addition, the 30% sucrose and 5% 2-mercaptoethanol were replaced with glycerol and dithiothreitol. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose in 10 mm CAPS, pH 11, with 10% methanol and boiled for 5 min. Immunoblotting was with 26D6 APP antibody and the signal detected by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG followed by enhanced chemiluminescence. Gels shown are representative of a minimum of three experiments with 2–3 replicates per experiment. Bands intensities were quantified using a CCD camera and software (Syngene).RESULTSReduction in Aβ42 Is Not Generalized Anti-inflammatory Actions—To confirm that the Aβ42-reducing activity was specific to NSAIDs and not mimicked by other anti-inflammatory compounds, we investigated the effects of glucocorticoids on Aβ42 levels in CHO cells stably transfected with wild-type human APP (APP-WT). In clinical trials, these compounds did not slow the rate of cognitive decline in AD individuals (16Koch H.J. Szecsey A. Neurology. 2000; 55: 1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 17Aisen P.S. Davis K.L. Berg J.D. Schafer K. Campbell K. Thomas R.G. Weiner M.F. Farlow M.R. Sano M. Grundman M. Thal L.J.

At the concentrations tested, neither prednisone nor dexamethasone reduced the amount of Aβ42 or the Aβ42:Aβ40 ratio (Table I).Table IAnti-inflammatory treatment does not reduce Aβ42:Aβ40CompoundConcentrations testedSelective reduction in Aβ42Prednisone0.1-10 μmNoneDexamethasone5 nm-5 μmNoneCimetidine1-20 μmNoneCurcumin1-50 μmNoneaAβ42:Aβ40 was slightly increased at curcumin doses 20μm and above.a Aβ42:Aβ40 was slightly increased at curcumin doses 20μm and above. Open table in a new tab Epidemiological studies (18Anthony J.C. Breitner J.C. Zandi P.P. Meyer M.R. Jurasova I. Norton M.C. Stone S.V. Neurology. 2000; 54: 2066-2071Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) have also suggested that antihistamine usage reduces the incidence of AD. Since histamine responses trigger inflammatory changes, we wanted to determine if blocking histamine action altered Aβ42 levels. Therefore, we treated Aβ-producing PS1ML cells with 0.5–20 μm of the H-2 histamine receptor antagonist cimetidine. This treatment did not alter the levels of Aβ detectable by ELISA (Table I) or bicine/urea gel analysis of conditioned medium.Recent studies indicated that the NSAID-like compound curcumin might be beneficial in a mouse model of AD (9Lim G.P. Yang F. Chu T. Gahtan E. Ubeda O. Beech W. Overmier J.B. Hsiao-Ashec K. Frautschy S.A. Cole G.M. Neurobiol. Aging. 2001; 22: 983-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Curcumin has both anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties. APP-WT CHO cells were treated with curcumin to determine if it affected the production of Aβ species. Between 1 and 100 μm, there was no reduction in Aβ levels or Aβ42:Aβ40 (Table I). Counter to the effect of NSAIDs, there was a slight increase (20%) in Aβ42:Aβ40 at doses between 20 and 100 μm. This increase in Aβ42:Aβ40 could be attributed to a reduction in Aβ40 levels. Higher doses were toxic to the cells so Aβ could not be evaluated.COX inhibition Is Not Required for NSAID Action on Aβ42—We previously reported that the reduction in Aβ42 levels secondary to NSAID treatment was accompanied by an increase in the amount of Aβ38 species (11Weggen S. Eriksen J.L. Das P. Sagi S.A. Wang R. Pietrzik C.U. Findlay K.A. Smith T.E. Murphy M.P. Bulter T. Kang D.E. Marquez-Sterling N. Golde T.E. Koo E.H. Nature. 2001; 414: 212-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar). However, several NSAIDs, such as naproxen and aspirin, did not reduce Aβ42 levels. Whether these NSAIDs affect shorter Aβ species was not investigated as the inactivity of naproxen in our previous study had only been determined by ELISA. Here we confirmed the lack of effect on Aβ peptides by both MALDI-TOF spectrometry and bicine/urea SDS-PAGE methods. In these assays, naproxen did not reduce Aβ1–42 or increase Aβ1–38, whereas sulindac sulfate, ibuprofen, flurbiprofen, and indomethacin were all effective (Fig. 2 and data not shown). In our earlier work, we used COX-deficient cells to demonstrate that COX enzymes are not required for sulindac sulfide to reduce Aβ42 levels. However, both of these approaches only concluded that COX inactivation is insufficient to reduce Aβ42 levels. To address whether COX inhibition is required to alter Aβ production we used R-flurbiprofen, which does not inhibit COX and is not efficiently isomerized to S-flurbiprofen. R-flurbiprofen potently reduced Aβ42 levels and increased production of shorter Aβs (Fig. 2C), in agreement with a recent report (19Morihara T. Chu T. Ubeda O. Beech W. Cole G.M. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 1009-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar).Fig. 2Aβ42 lowering potential of NSAIDs does not correlate with the ability to inhibit COX. A, MALDI-TOF analysis of Aβ reveals that not all NSAIDs alter Aβ42 and Aβ38 levels. PS1ML cells were treated with 300 μm naproxen, 350 μm ibuprofen, 250 μm flurbiprofen, or Me2SO control. Ibuprofen and flurbiprofen reduced Aβ42 and increased Aβ38 species while naproxen had no effect on any of the Aβ species. B, bicine-urea SDS gel analysis of Aβ from NSAID-treated cells. Results from naproxen, ibuprofen, and flurbiprofen treatment were similar to that obtained by MALDI-TOF. Migration of Aβ standard peptides is indicated on the right. C, bicine-urea SDS gel analysis of Aβ with flurbiprofen enantiomers. Cells were treated with 250 μm racemic, purified S- or R-flurbiprofen. Both enantiomers reduced Aβ42 as effectively as racemic compound.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Arachidonic Acid and Lipoxygenases Do Not Affect Aβ42 Levels—NSAIDs inhibit not only COX but can alter the activities of several lipoxygenases, which could increase arachidonic acid levels and effect the processing of arachidonic acid into HETEs and leukotrienes (Fig. 1). To mimic the effect of NSAIDs on increasing arachidonic acid levels, we treated the PS1ML cells with exogenous arachidonic acid and assayed the levels of the various Aβ species by ELISA and bicine/urea gels. We also treated cells with the phospholipase A2 activator, melittin (20Hassid A. Levine L. Res. Commun. Chem. Pathol. Pharmacol. 1977; 18: 507-517PubMed Google Scholar). This treatment mobilizes endogenous arachidonic acid from cellular membranes. Arachidonic acid, either added to the extracellular medium or induced by melittin, increased the total amount of Aβ generated by ∼20% as compared with control cells. In the case of arachidonic acid there was a slight reduction in the Aβ42:Aβ40 ratio, because of an increase in Aβ40 and not a decrease in Aβ42 (Table II). Melittin treatment had no effect on Aβ42:Aβ40 ratio.Table IIAltered arachidonic acid metabolism does not explain the NSAID effect on Aβ42CompoundPrimary ActionConcentrations testedSelective reduction in Aβ42Arachidonic acid25-250 μmNoneaArachidonic acid caused a slight decrease in Aβ42:Aβ40 because of an increase in Aβ40 but did not decrease Aβ42.Melittin↑ PLA20.1-5.0 μg/mlNoneMK886↓ 5-LOX0.1-1 μmNoneCaffeic acid↓ 5-LOX5-50 μmNoneBaicalein↓ 15-LOX5-50 μmNonea Arachidonic acid caused a slight decrease in Aβ42:Aβ40 because of an increase in Aβ40 but did not decrease Aβ42. Open table in a new tab Several NSAIDs, including ibuprofen and indomethacin, can inhibit the activity of 5-lipoxygenase (21Kolasa T. Brooks C.D. Rodriques K.E. Summers J.B. Dellaria J.F. Hulkower K.I. Bouska J. Bell R.L. Carter G.W. J. Med. Chem. 1997; 40: 819-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). 5-lipoxygenase expression may be elevated in aging human brains (22Manev H. Uz T. Sugaya K. Qu T. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1464-1469Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), so we wanted to determine if the NSAID effect on Aβ42 was mediated by inhibition of this enzyme. We examined whether other 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors could reduce the Aβ42 levels detected by our sensitive ELISA assay (Table II). The doses chosen for these compounds were above those published to inhibit 5-lipoxygenase, but below toxic concentrations. The inhibitors nordihydroguiaretic acid, MK-886, and caffeic acid, which preferentially inhibit 5-LOX, were without effect on total Aβ or Aβ42 production. Since at elevated doses these pharmacological inhibitors have multiple activities, which could mask the desired effect, we also used a genetic approach to eliminate 5-lipoxygenase activity. Neonatal fibroblasts from 5-lipoxygenase-deficient mice were infected with an adenovirus encoding APP695 and then treated with sulindac sulfide. As shown in Fig. 3A, sulindac retained the ability to inhibit Aβ42 production in these cells, verifying that 5-LOX is not necessary for the NSAID effect on Aβ42.Fig. 3The Aβ42 lowering potential of NSAIDs does require lipoxygenase 5, lipoxygenase 15, IKK2, or p65RelA.

Fischer S.M. Lippman S.M. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 1136-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), so we examined the effect of modulating 15-lipoxygenase on Aβ42:Aβ40. The 15-lipoxygenase inhibitor baicalein had no effect on Aβ42 levels (Table II). As above, we cultured fibroblasts from L-12-lipoxygenase-deficient mice and assayed Aβ levels after adenoviral infection. Once again we saw a marked reduction in Aβ42 with sulindac treatment (Fig. 3B), indicating that this enzyme is also not required for the amyloid-altering effects of NSAIDs.Peroxisome Proliferator-activated Receptors Do Not Alter Aβ42 levels—The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are sensitive to NSAIDs and the eicosanoids produced by arachidonic acid metabolism. Recent studies have also indicated that PPAR activation inhibits microglial activation and the production of proinflammatory molecules and may attenuate Aβ toxicity (25Combs C.K. Johnson D.E. Karlo J.C. Cannady S.B. Landreth G.E. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 558-567Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Combs C.K. Bates P. Karlo J.C. Landreth G.E. Neurochem. Int. 2001; 39: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). NSAIDs activate PPARα and PPARγ (27Lehmann J.M. Lenhard J.M. Oliver B.B. Ringold G.M. Kliewer S.A. J. Biol.

Cell. 1999; 99: 335-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar). Each or these PPARs must heterodimerize with the RXR nuclear transcription factor to bind DNA and alter transcription. If NSAIDS reduce Aβ42 by activating PPARα then the PPARα agonist 8(S)-HETE should also reduce Aβ42 levels from APP-expressing cells. However, 8(S)-HETE did not reduce Aβ42 levels secreted from APP-WT cells. Likewise the PPARγ agonists ciglitazone, 15-deoxy-Δ-prostaglandin J2 or BRL49653 (29Lehmann J.M. Moore L.B. Smith-Oliver T.A.

In addition, we examined the ability of a PPARγ antagonist, GW9662 (30Leesnitzer L.M. Parks D.J. Bledsoe R.K. Cobb J.E. Collins J.L. Consler T.G. Davis R.G. Hull-Ryde E.A. Lenhard J.M. Patel L.

This antagonist had no effect on the ability of sulindac to reduce Aβ42 levels (Fig. 4, A and B). We also tested the Aβ42-reducing potential of the RXR agonist LG10305, which was ineffective in reducing Aβ42 levels.Table IIIPeroxisome proliferator-activated receptors do not alter Aβ42:Aβ40CompoundReceptor targetConcentrations testedSelective reduction in Aβ42μ m8-(S)-HETE↑ PPARα0.1-1NoneCiglitazone↑ PPARγ5-50NoneProstaglandin J2↑ PPARγ0.1-10NoneBRL↑ PPARγ0.1-1NoneLG 10305↑ RXR0.1-10None Open table in a new tab Fig. 4PPARs do not alter Aβ42 production. A and B, inhibition of PPARγ with GW9662 does not affect the NSAID response. PS1ML cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of the PPARγ inhibitor GW9662 with or without 75 μm sulindac.

Quantitation of the GW9662 treatment studies is shown in panel B. C, overexpression of PPARγ or PPARδ does not alter Aβ40 or Aβ42 levels.

Overexpression of these receptors, with or without activator, did not alter the ratio of Aβ42:Aβ40 (Fig. 4C). Because pharmacologic and genetic manipulations of the various PPARs had no affect on Aβ42: Aβ40, these receptors are unlikely to mediate the NSAID Aβ42 response.NFκB Is Not Required to Mediate the Sulindac Sulfide-induced Reduction in Aβ42—Several NSAIDs can inhibit the activity of the NFκB transcription complex at one or more levels: the inhibition of IKK and the prevention of NFκB DNA binding (31Yamamoto Y.

Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3423) Google Scholar). The LPS contains three principle elements: lipid A, the core oligosaccharide, and the O-antigen. The core oligosaccharide provides the link between the highly conserved membrane-imbedded lipid A and the structurally diverse complex carbohydrate O-antigen chain (2Orskov I. Orskov F. Jann B. Jann K. Bacteriol. Rev. 1977; 41: 667-710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and can be further subdivided into the inner and outer core regions. Whereas the structure of the outer core is somewhat variable, the inner core is highly conserved, being primarily composed of l-glycero-d-manno-heptose and 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonate (KDO) residues (3Amor K. Heinrichs D.E. Frirdich E. Ziebell K. Johnson R.P. Whitfield C. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 1116-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). This suggests the importance of the inner core-lipid A complex in maintaining the structural integrity and viability of the cell (4Heinrichs D.E. Yethon J.A. Whitfield C. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 221-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been shown that the minimal LPS required to sustain growth in mutant Escherichia coli strains consists of the KDO2-lipid A core (Re endotoxin) (5Schnaitman C.A. Klena J.D.

Accordingly, enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of KDO are attractive targets for the development of specific antibiotics because of their localization to and high level of conservation within Gram-negative bacteria. The synthesis and activation of KDO involves four sequentially acting enzymes: d-arabinose 5-phosphate isomerase (API), deoxy-d-manno-octulosonate 8-phosphate (KDO 8-P) synthase, KDO 8-P phosphatase, and cytidine 5′-monophosphate-KDO synthetase (Fig. 1) (12Ray P.H.

Biochem. 1990; 59: 129-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). The first committed step to KDO generation is catalyzed by 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonate 8-phosphate (KDO 8-P) synthase, which condenses d-arabinose 5-phosphate (A5P) with phosphoenolpyruvate via a stereospecific aldol-type condensation (14Dotson G.D. Nanjappan P. Reily M.D. Woodard R.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12392-12397Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 15Radaev S. Dastidar P. Patel M. Woodard R.W. Gatti D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9476-9484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). A5P is the first intermediate unique to the KDO biosynthetic pathway, and API is the main de novo source of A5P in Gram-negative bacteria, because it is not readily available via glycolysis (16Fraenkel D.G. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 1. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 189-198Google Scholar). API synthesizes A5P by catalyzing the reversible aldol-keto isomerization of d-ribulose 5-phosphate (Ru5P) to A5P (Fig. 1). It is reasonable to speculate that inhibition of API will have similar cellular effects as direct KDO synthase inhibition (7Rick P.D. Osborn M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 3756-3760Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 8Rick P.D. Osborn M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4895-4903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Rick P.D. Young D.A. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 150: 447-455Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), thus providing another viable Gram-negative antibiotic target from the KDO pathway. The gene(s) encoding API in E. coli K-12 has yet to be positively identified. Recent work in this laboratory provided evidence that the open reading frame (ORF) yrbI encoded a 188-amino acid phosphatase that was highly specific for KDO 8-P (17Wu J. Woodard R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18117-18123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Analysis of the E. coli K-12 MG1655 genome (18Blattner F.R. Plunkett III, G. Bloch C.A. Perna N.T.

Science. 1997; 277: 1453-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (6055) Google Scholar) at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) web site revealed an ORF (yrbH) located next to yrbI in the yrb cluster encoding a putative phosphosugar isomerase. The yrbH gene was cloned, overexpressed, and purified to homogeneity. Utilizing a newly developed 96-well microplate assay, the recombinant protein was subsequently characterized and shown to catalyze the interconversion of A5P and Ru5P. This is the second unknown gene identified from the E. coli yrb cluster to be implicated in KDO biosynthesis. Materials—E. coli cells containing a plasmid with the yrbH ORF (b3197) were obtained from the archive clone collection of the University of Wisconsin E. coli K-12 Genome Sequencing Project (www.genome.wisc.edu/functional/archivecloning.htm).

The Centriprep YM-10 concentrators and Millex® syringe-driven filter units (0.22 μm) were purchased from Millipore. Hi Load™ Q-Sepharose (16/10) fast flow, phenyl Superose (HR 10/10), Superose 12 (HR 10/30), and fast desalting (HR 10/10) chromatography columns were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Polypropylene 96-well full-skirted reaction PCR plates were obtained from Life Science Products Inc. Corning polystyrene 96-well flat-bottom assay microplates were from Fisher Scientific. Microplates were read using the Model 550 microplate reader from Bio-Rad. Sequence Analysis—Data base searching was performed using the BLAST program at the NCBI website (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST) (19Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60228) Google Scholar). Clustal W was used to generate multiple sequence alignments (www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw) (20Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56001) Google Scholar). Protein Concentration Assay—Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent assay with bovine serum albumin serving as the standard. Cloning, Overexpression, and Purification of yrbH—Template DNA containing the yrbH gene was prepared by isolating the plasmid from the host cell line. Forward (5′-CATATGTCGCACGTAGAGTTACAACCGGG-3′) and reverse (5′-GATTCTGAATTCGGATCCA AGCTTACACTACGCCTGCACGCAGTAAATCATGCATgTGTAACACACCG-3′) primers were designed to incorporate NdeI and BamHI sites, respectively. In addition, the reverse primer was designed to remove an endogenous NdeI cut site (lowercase letters). The gene was amplified using standard PCR methodology (Failsafe™ PCR 2× premix buffer “F”) and directly ligated into the pCR®T7/CT-TOPO® vector. Chemically competent E. coli TOPO10′F cells were transformed with the recombinant vector, and plasmids were screened by restriction digest. A correct plasmid that had been verified by sequencing to contain the yrbH gene was then digested (NdeI and BamHI) and ligated into a similarly restricted pT7–7 expression vector that had been treated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase. The ligation mixture was used to transform chemically competent E. coli XL1-Blue cells, and a transformant harboring the correct pT7-yrbH plasmid was identified by restriction analysis and sequencing. E. coli BL21(DE3) cells were transformed with the plasmid, rechecked by restriction analysis, and stored at –80 °C. The E. coli BL21(DE3)/pT7-yrbH cells were grown in 2 × YT medium containing ampicillin (100 mg/liter) at 37 °C with shaking (250 rpm). Once the culture reached the mid-logarithmic growth phase (A600 ∼ 0.7–0.9), the culture was allowed to cool to 18 °C before being induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside at a final concentration of 0.4 mm. After 16 h of growth at 18 °C, the cells were harvested by centrifugation (6,500 × g, 15 min, 4 °C). The cell pellet (3.5 g wet weight) was suspended in 20 ml of buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) and then sonicated on ice (5 × 30 s; 2-min pauses between pulses). Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation (29,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C) and the supernatant (23 ml; 265 mg of protein) was filtered through a 0.22-μm Millex® filter. The solution was loaded onto a Hi Load™ (16/10) Q-Sepharose fast flow column that had been pre-equilibrated with buffer A. The protein was eluted using a 0–500 mm gradient of NaCl in buffer A over 90 min. Fractions containing primarily yrbH (∼35 kDa) as judged by SDS-PAGE were pooled (28 ml; 168 mg of protein). A saturated solution of AS was slowly added with stirring at room temperature until 22% saturation was reached (final volume of 38 ml). At this point, the solution was clarified by centrifugation (29,000 × g, 30 min, room temperature) and 10 ml was loaded onto a phenyl Superose (HR 10/10) column that had been equilibrated with a 25% saturated AS solution of buffer A. A reverse gradient of 25–0% saturated AS solution in buffer A over 60 min was used to elute the protein, with the majority of the 35-kDa protein appearing as a single peak after the end of the gradient. This peak from each of four runs was pooled (35 ml; 112 mg of total protein), dialyzed against 2 liters of buffer A overnight at 4 °C, and then concentrated. The preparation was greater than ∼98% homogeneous as judged by SDS-PAGE. The final total yield of homogeneous protein was 112 mg/500 ml cell culture. The purified enzyme was aliquoted (4.7 mg/ml), frozen in ethanol-dry ice, and stored at – 80 °C. One-dimensional Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis—SDS-PAGE was performed on protein samples (∼5–10 μg) under reducing conditions on a 12% polyacrylamide gel with a Mini-PROTEAN II electrophoresis unit (Bio-Rad). Gels were stained with 0.25% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250 solutions. Molecular Weight (MW) Determinations—The subunit MW of yrbH was determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry on a VESTEC-2000 instrument using a sinipinic acid matrix by the University of Michigan Protein Structure Facility. Protein samples were prepared by buffer exchange via overnight dialysis against 2 liters of 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, at 4 °C. The native MW was determined by gel filtration utilizing a Superose 12 column (HR10/30) with 150 mm NaCl in buffer A as eluent. The elution volume was determined in triplicate for all samples and standards. API Activity Assay—The API activity was determined by a 96-well microplate adaptation of the discontinuous cysteine-carbazole colorimetric assay initially developed by Dische and Borenfreund (21Dische Z. Borenfreund E. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 192: 583-587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and later modified by Ray and coworkers (22Bigham E.C. Gragg C.E. Hall W.R. Kelsey J.E. Mallory W.R. Richardson D.C. Benedict C. Ray P.H. J. Med. Chem. 1984; 27: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A solution containing 25 μlof enzyme at various concentrations in buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5) was incubated at 37 °C for 3 min in a 96-well reaction PCR plate using a Peltier thermal cycler. The reaction was initiated with 25 μl of a 2× mm A5P solution and subsequently quenched after various time intervals with 50 μl of 25 n H2SO4. A 90-μl aliquot was transferred to a flatbottom assay plate containing 250 μl of a freshly prepared H2SO4-cysteine-carbazole mixture (230 μl of 25 N H2SO4: 10 μl of an aqueous cysteine 1.5% (w/v) solution: 10 μl of a 0.12% (w/v) ethanolic carbazole solution) in each well. Plates were thoroughly mixed, and the color was allowed to develop at room temperature for 1 or 3 h, depending on the assay. It was observed that the sensitivity for ketose detection and the degree of reproducibility were increased by longer color development times at room temperature (data not shown) as opposed to shorter development times with heating (22Bigham E.C. Gragg C.E. Hall W.R. Kelsey J.E. Mallory W.R. Richardson D.C. Benedict C. Ray P.H. J. Med. Chem. 1984; 27: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, longer development times reduced the linear range, presumably because of the instability of the chromophore. Accordingly, plates being monitored for the appearance of ketose were read at 540 nm after 3 h of color development, and the plates being monitored for the disappearance of ketose were read after 1 h. All plates contained internal Ru5P standards and appropriate A5P controls in triplicate. One unit of enzyme activity is defined as the conversion of 1 μmol of sugar phosphate per minute at 37 °C. Metal Content Analysis—Enzyme samples as isolated above were prepared for metal analysis by extensive dialysis (48 h) against 2 liters of metal-free buffer B (20 mm Trizma-HCl, pH 8.5) at 4 °C. Metal-free protein samples were prepared by first incubating enzyme in the presence of 10 mm EDTA for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by isolation using a fast desalting column (HR 10/10) with buffer B as eluent. Divalent metal content of the as-isolated and EDTA-treated samples were determined by high-resolution inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry on a Finnigan MAT ELEMENT instrument at the University of Michigan Department of Geology. Effect of Divalent Metals on Activity—Enzyme samples of yrbH as isolated were diluted with buffer C (100 mm Trizma-HCl, pH 8.5) and incubated with various divalent metals or EDTA for 30 min at 4 °C. Activity was assayed at 37 °C under saturating substrate conditions in triplicate with a 3-min reaction time and 3-h color development (final API, 70 nm; A5P, 10 mm; metal or EDTA, 10 μm). EDTA-treated samples were desalted as described and incubated with various concentrations of Zn2+ at 4 °C for 30 min. The remaining activity was measured in triplicate at 37 °C with a 2-min reaction and 3-h color development (final API, 15 nm; A5P, 10 mm; Zn2+, 0–25 μm). Optimum pH and pKa Determination—The activities of yrbH in solutions of varying pH values (6.25–10) were measured by diluting the enzyme in 200 mm BTP buffers containing 2 mm EDTA. The pH of the buffers was adjusted at 37 °C. Activity was measured as outlined above in triplicate with a 3-min reaction time and 3-h color development (final API, 70 nm; A5P, 10 mm; EDTA, 1 mm). The bell-shaped V app data were fit to Equation 1 using nonlinear least-squares fitting to estimate pKa values. Vapp=Vmax11+10-pH10-pKa1+10-pKa210-pH(Eq. 1) Substrate Specificity—Enzyme samples were diluted in buffer C containing 2 mm EDTA and assayed by initiating the reaction with 25 μl of 20 mm sugar (final API, 70 nm; EDTA, 1 mm; sugar, 10 mm). After 10 min at 37 °C, reactions containing the potential alternate substrates d-arabinose, d-ribose 5-phosphate, d-glucose 6-phosphate, d-glucose 1-phosphate, d-glucosamine 6-phosphate, or d-mannose 6-phosphate were quenched and the presence of ketose was determined as outlined above for A5P. Each carbohydrate was assayed in triplicate, along with appropriate controls from which the addition of enzyme was withheld. The lower limit of detection for this assay is estimated to be under 1% of ketose formation. Because the respective ketose forms of d/l-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and d/l-erythrose 4-phosphate do not readily form chromophores under the assay conditions used, product appearance was monitored by 31P NMR for these two substrates. Determination of Kinetic Parameters—Reactions were performed at 37 °C using the discontinuous microplate assay as outlined above, using buffer C containing 2 mm EDTA to dilute the enzyme stock solution. Substrate concentrations typically ranged from a Km of 0.2 to 10. After 2 min the reactions (final API, 7 nm; EDTA, 1 mm) were quenched, at which point approximately less than 10% of substrate had been consumed. Color was developed for 1 or 3 h when using Ru5P or A5P as substrate, respectively. Initial rates (v 0) were determined in triplicate and fit to the standard Michaelis-Menten equation using nonlinear least-squares regression to determine values for Km and k cat. Equilibrium (Keq) Determination—Solutions containing either A5P or Ru5P (0.5, 1, or 2 mm) were incubated in buffer C with 1 mm EDTA at 37 °Cfor4hinthe presence of enzyme (API, 700 nm). Reactions were quenched and color developed as above (1 h). In a separate experiment, solutions containing either 5 mm A5P or 5 mm Ru5P in 50 mm Trizma-HCl, pH = 7.5, with 1 mm EDTA and 10% D2O were incubated in the presence of 700 nm API at 37 °C. Reactions were periodically monitored by 31P NMR using a Bruker Avance DRX-300 instrument with WALTZ16 proton decoupling. A 10-s delay (>3 times the T1A5P/Ru5P) was used during the acquisition to ensure complete relaxation of the phosphorus nucleus, thus allowing direct integration and comparison of peak areas for the two different sugar phosphates under observation. Chemical shifts were referenced to an external phosphoric acid standard (0 ppm). Once there was no change in peak ratios for both samples, the spectra were acquired (64 scans). K eq is reported for API in the direction of Ru5P product formation from A5P substrate (Ru5P/A5P). Identification of yrbH as API in E. coli K-12—To date, the genes encoding the enzymes that are part of the KDO pathway in E. coli K-12 have all been identified except for API (Fig. 1). The genes do not belong to a common operon, and this includes the recently identified KDO 8-P phosphatase gene, yrbI (17Wu J. Woodard R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18117-18123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Genomic analysis using the NCBI website indicated that genes in the yrb cluster are conserved among several Gram-negative bacteria, including the ORF yrbH (Table I). The yrbH gene encodes a 328-amino acid long putative phosphosugar isomerase. Interestingly, a BLAST search with yrbH revealed the existence of at least one other paralogue (gutQ) in the E. coli K-12 genome (18Blattner F.R. Plunkett III, G. Bloch C.A. Perna N.T. Burland V.

Chem. 2002; 277: 24103-24113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Because yrbH is located next to an enzyme involved in KDO synthesis, is highly conserved in Gram-negative bacteria, is predicted to be a phosphosugar isomerase, and has the highest degree of homology among the E. coli paralogues with NMB0352, the yrbH ORF was chosen as the candidate E. coli K-12 gene encoding for the API involved in the generation of A5P for LPS synthesis.Table ISurvey of yrbH-like sequences from Gram-negative bacteriaSourceaSequences having greater than 20% identity with any of the E. coli proteins included in the table.Accession numberFlanking gene(s)Closest homologue in E. coli bCompared to E. coli K-12 yrbH, K-12 gutQ, and CFT073 kpsF sequences.% IdentitycCalculated by number of identical residues as determined from BLAST searches with each respective E. coli sequence divided by query amino acid sequence length.Sequence lengthE. coli K-12 M1655yrbHNP_417664yrbG, yrbIyrbH100328gutQNP_417188srlR, ygaAgutQ100308E. coli CFT073yrbHNP_755823yrbG, yrbIyrbH99335gutQNP_755143srlR, ygaAgutQ98321kpsFNP_755561kpsEkpsF100339S. typhimurium LT2yrbHNP_462225yrbG, yrbIyrbH92328gutQNP_461759srlR, ygaAgutQ93308Y. pestis CO92YrbHNP_407034yrbG, yrbIyrbH77328P. aeruginosa PA01YrbHNP_253147PA4456, yrbIyrbH57326N. meninigitidis MC58NMB0352dAnnotated as kpsF (25) although the genomic location and homology would suggest yrbH as being more appropriate nomenclature.

Open table in a new tab Overexpression and Purification of yrbH—The recombinant protein yrbH was overexpressed using the pT7–7 expression vector (Fig. 3). Optimal conditions for the maximal ratio of recombinant to cellular protein were achieved by overnight expression at 18 °C. The protein exhibited a strong propensity to aggregate, particularly at pH values below 7.2 (data not shown). Efficient purification to homogeneity was achieved in two steps using a Q-Sepharose anion exchange column followed by a phenyl Superose column (Table II). The specific activity after dialysis was 246 units/mg.

Open table in a new tab Molecular Weight Determination—The subunit molecular weight of yrbH as determined by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis under reducing conditions was 35,000 (MWcalc = 35,200) (Fig. 3). The observed doublet, which was at first attributed to proteolytic degradation, could not be prevented by the inclusion of standard protease inhibitors (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, EDTA, pepstatin) in the lysis buffer. However, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry indicated the presence of a single protein species (M+1 = 35,084, M+2 = 17,540), suggesting the observed doublet in SDS-PAGE is an artifact of sample degradation during preparation and/or partial denaturation. The native molecular mass as determined by gel filtration was 122 ± 5 kDa, indicating API is likely a tetramer (∼3.5 subunits).

https://openalex.org/W2069491458,"Dupuytren's disease (DD) is a superficial fibromatosis of the hand. Although the molecular mechanisms responsible for this disease are unknown, recent studies suggest that beta-catenin may be a key factor involved in fibromatosis. In this study, we analysed the in vivo and in vitro expression levels of beta-catenin in DD, using surgical specimens and primary cell lines. Although no somatic mutations (exon 3) of beta-catenin were detected, Western blot analysis revealed high levels of beta-catenin in diseased palmar fascia, and low to undetectable levels of beta-catenin in patient-matched normal palmar fascia. Immunohistochemistry analysis showed high levels of beta-catenin expression within the disease fascia, as well as cytoplasmic and nuclear accumulations of the protein. Immunoprecipitation of beta-catenin from seven patient lesions showed the protein to be tyrosine phosphorylated. Lastly, Western analysis of three patient-matched (disease and normal fascia) primary cell cultures showed significantly elevated levels of beta-catenin in disease cells cultured in three-dimensional collagen lattices. This is the first extensive in vivo and in vitro characterization of beta-catenin in DD, and the first to suggest that the extracellular matrix may play an important role in modulating beta-catenin stability in DD."

The αfoldon chains were expressed in Pichia pastoris cells that also expressed the two types of subunit of human prolyl 4-hydroxylase; the foldon domain was subsequently removed by pepsin treatment, which also digests non-triple helical collagen chains, whereas triple helical collagen molecules are resistant to it. The foldon domain was found to be very effective in chain assembly, as expression of the α1(I)foldon or α1(III)foldon chains gave about 2.5–3-fold the amount of pepsin-resistant type I or type III collagen homotrimers relative to those obtained using the authentic C-propeptides. In contrast, expression of chains with no oligomerization domain led to very low levels of pepsin-resistant molecules. Expression of α2(I)foldon chains gave no pepsin-resistant molecules at all, indicating that in addition to control at the level of the C-propeptide other restrictions at the level of the collagen domain exist that prevent the formation of stable [α2(I)]3 molecules. Co-expression of α1(I)foldon and α2(I)foldon chains led to an efficient assembly of heterotrimeric molecules, their amounts being about 2-fold those obtained with the authentic C-propeptides and the α1(I) to α2(I) ratio being 1.91 ± 0.31 (S.D.). As the foldon sequence contains no information for chain recognition, our data indicate that chain assembly is influenced not only by the C-terminal oligomerization domain but also by determinants present in the α chain domains.

The collagen superfamily of proteins includes more than 20 types of collagen and more than 15 additional proteins that have collagen-like domains. All collagen molecules consist of three polypeptide chains, called α chains, 1The abbreviations used are: α chain, a collagen polypeptide chain; proα chain, a procollagen polypeptide chain; pCα chain, a procollagen polypeptide lacking the N-propeptide; αfoldon chain, a pCα chain with the C-propeptide replaced by the foldon domain.1The abbreviations used are: α chain, a collagen polypeptide chain; proα chain, a procollagen polypeptide chain; pCα chain, a procollagen polypeptide lacking the N-propeptide; αfoldon chain, a pCα chain with the C-propeptide replaced by the foldon domain. that are coiled around each other into a triple helix and contain the triplet sequence -Gly-X-Y-, in which the Y position amino acid is often 4-hydroxyproline. The most abundant collagens form fibrils and are therefore known as fibril-forming collagens, whereas others form other kinds of supramolecular structures. The molecules of the most abundant fibril-forming collagen, type I, consist of two α1(I) chains and one α2(I) chain, whereas the molecules of type III collagen are [α1(III)]3 homotrimers. In addition to the type I collagen heterotrimer, most tissues also contain a small amount of type I collagen with a chain composition of [α1(I)]3, known as the type I collagen homotrimer (for reviews, see Refs. 1Kadler K. Protein Profile. 1995; 2: 491-619PubMed Google Scholar, 2Prockop D.J. Kivirikko K.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 403-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1355) Google Scholar, 3Bateman J.F. Lamandé S.R.

Med. 2001; 33: 7-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). The fibril-forming collagens are synthesized as procollagen molecules with N- and C-terminal propeptides. Chain assembly begins with association of the three C-propeptides through a process directed by their structures (2Prockop D.J. Kivirikko K.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 403-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1355) Google Scholar, 5McLaughlin S.H. Bulleid N.J. Matrix Biol. 1998; 16: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Renaturation experiments with individual type I collagen α chains that lack any propeptides have indicated, however, that the chains form both [α(I)]2α2(I) heterotrimers and [α1(I)]3 homotrimers, although the process is very slow and the T m values of the molecules formed are lower than of those present in vivo (6Tkocz C.

Based on these findings and numerous subsequent studies carried out in a large variety of biological systems over a period of more than 25 years, the C-propeptides are now believed to be essential for correct chain recognition and to play a crucial role in chain assembly in vivo (2Prockop D.J.

A recent study reported, highly surprisingly, that assembly of triple helical recombinant type I collagen molecules from partially hydroxylated α chains in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae does not even require the C-propeptides (20Olsen D.R.

The triple helical molecules had an α1(I) to α2(I) chain ratio of 5:1, however, suggesting that they consist of mixtures of [α1(I)]2α2(I) heterotrimers and [α1(I)]3 homotrimers (20Olsen D.R.

In the present work we have studied whether fully hydroxylated recombinant human type I collagen α chains lacking C-propeptides can assemble effectively into triple helical molecules in the yeast Pichia pastoris when it co-expresses the two types of subunits of a recombinant human prolyl 4-hydroxylase (12Vuorela A.

Yeast. 2001; 18: 797-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). As the collagen domains of the α chains of type III collagen, unlike those of type I, contain two cysteine residues at their C-terminal ends, which are involved in the formation of interchain disulfide bonds (see Ref. 21Bulleid N.J. Wilson R. Lees J.F. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), we also determined whether type III collagen α chains lacking their C-propeptides would be assembled more effectively than those of type I. One major aspect studied here was whether the 30-kDa C-propeptides of the proα1(I), proα2(I), or proα1(III) chains could be replaced by foldon, a 29-amino acid peptide that is normally located at the C terminus of the polypeptide chains in the bacteriophage T4 fibritin, a three-stranded α helical coiled-coil protein, and appears to be essential for the assembly of the fibritin molecule (22Tao Y.

The addition of foldon to the C terminus of the peptide (Pro-Pro-Gly)10 has been shown to markedly increase the T m of the triple helical 4-hydroxyproline-free molecules that are formed from these peptides even in the absence of foldon (25Frank S. Kammerer R.A. Mechling D. Schulthess T. Landwehr R. Bann J. Guo Y Lustig A. Bächinger H.P. Engel J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 1081-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 26Boudko S.

No data are available to indicate whether foldon could be used to replace the C-propeptides of proα chains in the assembly of stable triple helical collagen molecules. We were unable to confirm the effective assembly of triple helical collagen molecules from α chains lacking the C-propeptides in yeast cells (20Olsen D.R. Leigh S.D. Chang R. McMullin H. Ong W.

Expression of α1(I)foldon or α1(III)foldon chains led to an even more efficient assembly of homotrimeric molecules with stable triple helices than in the cases of chains expressed with their own C-propeptides. Furthermore, co-expression of the α1(I)foldon and α2(I)foldon chains led to the effective formation of type I collagen heterotrimers with the correct 2:1 chain ratio, indicating that the chain composition is determined not only by the C-terminal oligomerization domain but also by determinants present in the collagen domain of the polypeptide chains, at least in the case of very small oligomerization domains such as foldon.

The foldon fragments were co-ligated into HindIII-NotI digested pBluescript (Stratagene) to generate pBSfoldon. To replace the sequence coding for the C-propeptide of the pCα1(I) chain with that coding for foldon, two fragments were generated by PCR, the first extending from an internal BamHI site in the pCα1(I) cDNA to the codon for the last amino acid of the C-telopeptide and the second from the first codon of the foldon cDNA to the NotI site following the stop codon. These fragments were co-ligated into BamHI-NotI-digested pPIC3KpCα1(I) to generate pPIC3Kα1(I)foldon. To delete the C-propeptide, a fragment extending from the internal BamHI site of pCα1(I) cDNA to the codon for the last amino acid of the C-telopeptide followed by a stop codon, and a NotI site was created by PCR and ligated into BamHI-NotI-digested pPIC3KpCα1(I) to generate pPIC3Kα1(I).

Schematic representations of the pCα1(I), α1(I)foldon and α1(I) chains are shown in Fig. 1. PCα2(I), α2(I)foldon, PCα1(I)+PCα2(I), and α1(I)foldon+α2(I)foldon Strains—A P. pastoris expression cassette encoding human pCα2(I) chains was digested from pBLADEIXpCα2(I) (14Nokelainen M. Tu H. Vuorela A. Notbohm H. Kivirikko K.I. Myllyharju J. Yeast. 2001; 18: 797-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) with PmeI-NotI and cloned into pPICZB to generate pPICZBpCα2(I). To replace the C-propeptide of pCα2(I) with foldon, two fragments were generated by PCR, the first extending from an internal AvrII site in the pCα2(I) cDNA to the codon for the last amino acid of the C-telopeptide, and the second encoding foldon as above. These fragments were co-ligated into AvrII-NotI-digested pPICZBpCα2(I) to generate pPICZBα2(I)foldon. The constructs were linearized with PmeI and transformed into the ArgαAdeβ,his–strain to generate the strains PCα2(I) and α2(I)foldon. To study the expression of type I collagen heterotrimers, the linearized pPICZBpCα2(I) and pPICZBα2(I)foldon constructs were transformed into the above strains expressing pCα1(I) and α1(I)foldon chains, respectively. PCα1(III), α1(III)foldon, and α1(III) Strains—To delete the sequence encoding the N-propeptide of proα1(III) chains, a PCR fragment extending from the PmeI site of the alcohol oxidase 5′ sequence of pPICZB to the end of the signal sequence of proα1(III) and followed directly by the sequence coding for the N-telopeptide of proα1(III) until an internal NdeI site was amplified using pPICZBproα1(III) (12Vuorela A.

The fragment was cloned into PmeI-NdeI digested pPICZBproα1(III) to generate pPICZBpCα1(III). To change the expression vectors, the proα1(III) and pCα1(III) expression cassettes were digested from the pPICZB vectors with PmeI-NotI and cloned into pPIC3K to generate pPIC3Kproα1(III) and pPIC3KpCα1(III). To replace the C-propeptide of pCα1(III) with foldon, two fragments were generated by PCR, the first extending from an internal AvrII site in the pCα1(III) cDNA to the 3′ end of the C-telopeptide sequence and the second encoding foldon as described above. The fragments were co-ligated into AvrII-NotI-digested pPIC3KpCα1(III) to generate pPIC3Kα1(III)foldon. To delete the C-propeptide, a fragment extending from the internal AvrII site to the 3′ end of the C-telopeptide sequence followed by a stop codon, and a NotI site was created by PCR and ligated into AvrII-NotI-digested pPIC3KpCα1(III) to generate pPIC3Kα1(III). The pPIC3Kproα1(III), pPIC3KpCα1(III), pPIC3Kα1(III)foldon, and pPIC3Kα1(III) constructs were linearized with StuI and transformed into the ArgαAdeβ,his–strain. Culture and Induction of P. pastoris Strains—Cells were cultured in 25-ml shaker flasks in a buffered glycerol complex medium, pH 6.0, with 1 g/liter yeast extract and 2 g/liter peptone. Expression was induced in a buffered minimal methanol medium, pH 6.0, and methanol was added every 12 h to a final concentration of 0.5%. Amino acids were added up to 100 μg/liter as required. Analysis of the Recombinant Collagens—Cells were harvested after a 60-h methanol induction at 30 °C, washed once, and suspended in cold (4 °C) 5% glycerol, 1 mm Pefabloc SC, and 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. The cells were broken by vortexing with glass beads, and the lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min. Aliquots of the soluble fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions followed by Western blotting with polyclonal type I or type III collagen antibodies (Rockland). Further aliquots were digested with pepsin for 2 h at 22 °C or 16 h at 4 °C, the thermal stability of the pepsin-resistant recombinant collagens was studied by digestion with a mixture of trypsin and chymotrypsin for 2 min at various temperatures (28Bruckner P. Prockop D.J. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 110: 360-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), and the samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing or nonreducing conditions followed by Coomassie Blue staining or Western blotting as described above. The amounts of the collagen chains were estimated by densitometry of the Coomassie Blue-stained bands using a GS-710 calibrated imaging densitometer (Bio-Rad). Assembly of Stable Type I [α1(I)] 3 and Type III [α1(III)] 3 Homotrimers—It has previously been shown that stable recombinant human type I and type III collagen homotrimers and type I collagen heterotrimers can be produced in P. pastoris by expressing full-length proα1(I) or proα1(III) chains alone or by co-expressing proα1(I) chains with proα2(I) chains in a recombinant strain also expressing human prolyl 4-hydroxylase α2β2 tetramers (12Vuorela A.

In addition, the expression levels of the type I pCcollagen homotrimers and heterotrimers were 1.5–3-fold relative to those of the corresponding procollagen trimers (14Nokelainen M. Tu H. Vuorela A.

https://openalex.org/W2063171003,"Protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) plays an important role in the regulation of glycogen synthesis by insulin. Protein targeting to glycogen (PTG) enhances glycogen accumulation by increasing PP1 activity against glycogen-metabolizing enzymes. However, the specificity of PTG's effects on cellular dephosphorylation and glucose metabolism is unclear. Overexpression of PTG in 3T3-L1 adipocytes using a doxycycline-controllable adenoviral construct resulted in a 10–20-fold increase in PTG levels and an 8-fold increase in glycogen levels. Inclusion of 1 μg/ml doxycycline in the media suppressed PTG expression, and fully reversed all PTG-dependent effects. Infection of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with the PTG adenovirus caused a marked dephosphorylation and activation of glycogen synthase. The effects of PTG seemed specific, because basal and insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of a variety of signaling proteins was unaffected. Indeed, glycogen synthase was the predominant protein whose phosphorylation state was decreased in 32P-labeled cells. PTG overexpression did not alter PP1 protein levels but increased PP1 activity 6-fold against phosphorylase in vitro. In contrast, there was no change in PP1 activity measured using myelin basic protein, suggesting that PTG overexpression specifically directed PP1 activity against glycogen-metabolizing enzymes. To investigate the metabolic consequences of altering PTG levels, glucose uptake and storage in 3T3-L1 adipocytes was measured. PTG overexpression did not affect 2-deoxy-glucose transport rates in basal and insulin-stimulated cells but dramatically enhanced glycogen synthesis rates under both conditions. Despite the large increases in cellular glucose flux upon PTG overexpression, basal and insulin-stimulated glucose incorporation into lipid were unchanged. Cumulatively, these data indicate that PTG overexpression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes discretely stimulates PP1 activity against glycogen synthase and phosphorylase, resulting in a marked and specific increase in glucose uptake and storage as glycogen."
https://openalex.org/W2064722919,"The Wilms' tumor suppressor gene, WT1, functions as a transcriptional regulator that represses or activates the expression of a variety of putative target genes. However, it is not clear which genes are the biological targets of WT1, nor which cellular pathway(s) is critically altered in tumors as a result of WT1 mutation. To investigate in vivo the role of WT1 as a transcription factor in Wilms' tumors, we used cDNA microarrays to compare the expression of putative WT1 target genes in a set of 15 primary Wilmstumors carrying WT1-inactivating mutations versus a set of 16 tumors with no WT1 mutations. We hypothesized that the expression of direct downstream targets of WT1 that are relevant to tumor development would differ between these two genetically distinct sets of tumors. Using the Atlas Human Cancer 1.2 cDNA arrays to quantitate gene expression in the 31 tumors, we found that the expression of one WT1 putative target gene, c-MYC, statistically significantly differed between the two sets of tumors and was upregulated in WT1-mutant tumors. This increase of relative gene expression for c-MYC was confirmed using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The differential expression of another putative target gene, EGR1, approached significance and was also upregulated in WT1-mutant tumors. These data, in addition to the coexpression of c-MYC and WT1 in embryonic renal mesenchyme, strongly suggest that c-MYC is a biologically relevant target of WT1 in Wilmstumors."
https://openalex.org/W2000700820,"The PLZF gene is translocated in a subset of all-trans-retinoic acid resistant acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) cases, encodes a DNA binding transcription factor and is expressed highly in haematopoietic progenitor cells as well-developing central nervous system (CNS). The spatially restricted and temporally dynamic pattern of PLZF expression in the developing CNS suggested that it might play a role in the circuitry regulating hindbrain segmentation. We have now identified a PLZF binding site (PLZF-RE) in an enhancer region of Hoxb2 that itself is required for directing high-level expression in rhombomers 3 and 5 of the developing hindbrain. The wild-type r3/r5 enhancer linked to a heterologous promoter was responsive to regulation by PLZF, and this activity was lost in variants containing a mutated PLZF-RE. Compared with the wild-type protein, the binding of the APL-associated reciprocal RARα–PLZF fusion to PLZF-RE was much stronger, suggesting that the N-terminal PLZF sequences missing from the fusion may play a role in the regulation of DNA binding. Consistent with this, the N-terminal POZ domain was required for cooperative binding of PLZF to a multimerized PLZF-RE. In the context of the r3/r5 enhancer, the PLZF-RE cooperated for PLZF binding with an additional A/T-rich motif positioned downstream of the PLZF-RE. This A/T motif was previously shown to be essential for the regulation of Hoxb2 expression in r3 and r5 in cooperation with another Krüppel-like zinc finger protein Krox 20. The presence of both the PLZF-RE and the A/T-rich motif was required for a maximal effect of PLZF on a heterologous promoter and was essential in vivo to direct the expression of a lacZ reporter in the chick neural tube. Hence, both PLZF and Krox20 cooperate with a common A/T motif in mediating in vivo activity of the Hoxb2 enhancer. Our findings indicate that Hoxb2 is a direct target for regulation by PLZF in the developing CNS and suggest that deregulation of Hox gene expression may contribute to APL pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2021310757,"A variant of antifreeze protein (AFP) named RD3 from antarctic eel pout (Lycodichthys dearborni) comprises the type III AFP intramolecular dimer, which is known to exhibit a significant enhancement of thermal hysteresis when compared with the type III AFP monomer (Miura, K., Ohgiya, S., Hoshino, T, Nemoto, N., Suetake, T., Miura, A, Spyracopoulos, L., Kondo, H., and Tsuda, S.

Hew C.L. Davies P.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 359-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). The water solution of AFP exhibits a non-colligative freezing temperature (T f) depression, which is 300–500-fold effective compared with the equilibrium colligative depression observed for the ordinary solutes (on a molar basis) (2Yeh Y. Feeney R.E. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 601-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). To date, it appeared that such a splendid T f depression of AFP is a result of its ice binding ability, which inhibits the growth of embryo ice crystals that naturally emerged in the supercooling water. This ice growth inhibitory function of AFP does not change significantly the melting temperature (T m) of the solution so that it gives a difference between T f and T m, which is generally termed thermal hysteresis (TH) (2Yeh Y. Feeney R.E. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 601-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Because such a unique inhibitory function of AFP exhibits a high potential for the cryo-industrial usages, such as cryo-preservations of tissues and cells and maintaining the texture of frozen materials (3Carpenter J.F. Hansen T.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8953-8957Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 4Chao H. Davies P.L. Carpenter J.F. J. Exp. Biol. 1996; 199: 2071-2076PubMed Google Scholar), it becomes more and more significant to design and produce the activity-improved variants of AFP based on the detailed understanding of its ice-binding mechanism. An elegant explanation for the non-colligative depression of T f of AFP was made by “adsorption-inhibition mechanism,” in which accumulations of AFPs onto the growing surfaces of ice crystal result in the creations of numbers of convex ice surfaces at the limited open spaces on the ice between the bound AFPs (5Raymond J.A. DeVries A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 2589-2593Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). The free energy of the convex ice surfaces becomes larger with the increase of the surface curvature (so-called Kelvin effect (6Knight C.A. Cheng C.C. DeVries A.L. Biophys. J. 1991; 59: 409-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar)). Therefore, the further binding of water molecules onto the convex ice surfaces becomes energetically unfavorable, leading to the suppression of the ice crystal growth by increasing the number of bound AFPs. This irreversible ice binding model was then modified to a semi-reversible model (7Hew C.L. Yang D.S.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 203: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 8Wen D.

Rubinsky B. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 241-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar): (i) attachment to the ice-water interface; (ii) rearrangement of adsorbed molecules by diffusion, reorientation, and/or conformational change; and (iii) detachment from the interface. It was assumed that such progressive steps of AFP adsorption are highly correlated with the local concentration of AFPs around the ice crystal surface (2Yeh Y. Feeney R.E. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 601-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Here we focused a 7-kDa small globular type III AFP (10Li X.-M. Trinh K.-Y. Hew C.L. Buettner B. Baenziger J. Davies P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12904-12909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and its genetically synthesized dimer, trimer, and tetramer to investigate the AFP multimerization effects on the T f depression and the ice crystal morphology. The type III AFP has been studied extensively for the species identified from Macrozoarces americanus (Atlantic ocean pout) and appeared to possess a diversity in amino acid sequences by multiple gene encodings (10Li X.-M.

Structure. 1996; 15: 1325-1337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (165) Google Scholar) revealed that type III AFP constructs a globular shape characterized by “2-fold symmetric motif” or a “pretzel fold.” It also revealed that the putative ice-binding residues (e.g. Gln9, Asn14, Thr15, Thr18, and Gln44), which were identified by observing the effect of site-directed mutations of these residues on the TH activity, are located in the planar surface of the type III AFP with tight atom packing, so as to undergo a specific interaction with the ice prism plane (15DeLuca C.I. Davies P.L. Ye Q. Zia Z. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 515-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In 1995, RD3 was identified as an exceptional isomer of the type III AFP from Lycodichthys dearborni (Antarctic ocean pout) and appeared to comprise the two type III AFP domains connected in tandem through a 9-residue linker sequence (-Asp-Gly-Thr-Thr-Ser-Pro-Gly-Leu-Lys-) (16Wang X. DeVries A.L. Cheng C.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1247: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of RD3 was determined using multidimensional NMR techniques (17Miura K. Ohgiya S. Hoshino T Nemoto N. Suetake T. Miura A Spyracopoulos L. Kondo H. Tsuda S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1304-1310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), which revealed the following: (i) the N- and C-domains construct the ordinary type III AFP structures that are laterally oriented with an angle of 32 ± 12°, and (ii) a flexible bend of the 9-residue linker sequence brings the two ice-binding planes of RD3 to an allowed range of orientation. Interestingly, it appeared that TH activity of RD3 is not a simple additive activity of the two type III AFP monomers but exhibits about 6-fold enhancements compared with the monomer (on a molar basis) in the lower concentration range (0–0.5 mm) (17Miura K. Ohgiya S. Hoshino T Nemoto N. Suetake T. Miura A Spyracopoulos L. Kondo H. Tsuda S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1304-1310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This significant TH enhancement of RD3 was ascribed to some cooperative effect originating from the two proximal domains; however, no further information has been obtained for considering detailed tandem repetition effects of the AFP domains on the thermal hysteresis and the ice crystal morphology. In the present study, we attempted to design and generate new intramolecular dimer, trimer, and tetramer of the type III AFP, for which we utilized the primary sequences of either N- or C-domain of RD3. For example, RD3NNC denotes a protein comprising the tandem connections of the two successive N-domain sequences plus the C-domain sequence of RD3. We succeeded in generating RD3NN, RD3NNC, RD3NCN, RD3NCC, and RD3NCNC, for which connections of the AFP domains utilize the 9-residue linker sequence of the native RD3. For these artificial AFP multimers, we measured and compared the TH activity and the ice crystal morphology. Significantly, these AFP multimers exhibit different levels of enhanced TH activity compared with the type III AFP monomer at a lower AFP concentration range on molar and domain bases. It further appeared that these AFP multimers affect the ice crystal morphology in different ways. We believe that these results will significantly expand our understandings of the ice-binding mechanism of AFP and its effect on the TH activity and the ice crystal morphology, which will lead to the design and the production of an activity-modified or -enhanced variant of AFP. Construction of DNAs Encoding the Type III AFP Multimers—Our previously synthesized genes of RD3 (17Miura K. Ohgiya S. Hoshino T Nemoto N. Suetake T. Miura A Spyracopoulos L. Kondo H. Tsuda S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1304-1310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and RD3Nl (18Miura K. Ohgiya S. Hoshino T. Nemoto N. Odaira M. Nitta K. Tsuda S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 126: 387-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) were utilized for the present constructions of DNAs to express the type III AFP intramolecular dimer, trimer, and tetramer. A gene encoding RD3 was newly prepared, in which we removed KpnI and SmaI restriction sites located in a portion encoding the 9-residue linker by using the site-directed mutagenesis (denoted as RD3ΔSma/Kpn). By using this as a template, we further prepared a gene that encodes 6–9 residues of the linker plus RD3 (denoted Linker-RD3) by PCR using a forward primer (5′-CGCGGATCCTATTCGTAGTTTTTAACCATG-3′) and a backward primer (5′-GGAACTGCAGCCCGGGTCTGAAATCCGTTGTTGCTAACCAG-3′). It is noted that the gene encoding the part of the linker is designed so as to include SmaI restriction site. Likewise, a gene encoding RD3 plus linker (RD3-Linker) was constructed using a forward primer (5′-GTCCCCCGGGGAGGTGGTGCCGTCTTCGTAGTTTTTAACCATGTCCGGCATCAGGGTCTG-3′) and a backward primer (5′-GAGCTGCAGTTAACTTTAAG-3′). In this case, the gene encoding 1st to 6th residues of the linker was prepared to include only SmaI restriction site. In addition, the gene encoding a part of the linker (including the SmaI restriction site) connected with that encoding the N-domain of RD3 (denoted as Linker-RD3N) was amplified using a forward (5′-CGCGGATCCTATTCGTAGTTTTTAACCATG-3′) and a backward primer (5′-GGAACTGCAGCCCGGGTCTGAAATCCGTTGTTGCTAACCAG-3′) by using the gene encoding the N-domain of RD3 as a template. Combined use of these prepared DNA fragments (RD3ΔSma/Kpn, Linker-RD3, Linker-RD3N, RD3-Linker, RD3, and RD3Nl) made it possible to construct the genes encoding RD3NN, RD3NCC, RD3NNC, RD3NCN, and RD3NCNC as summarized in Fig. 1, for which the DNA sequences were occasionally digested with NdeI and BamHI followed by ligations with a vector pET20b (Novagen). Expressions and Purifications of the Recombinant Multimers—The plasmid DNAs were transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL 21 (DE3), which was grown at 28 °C in LB medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin until the cell growth reaches to the early stationary phase. To induce the expression of any recombinant AFP multimer, 0.5 mm isopropyl-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added, and the cultures were grown at 28 °C for overnight. The purification of the multimers was commonly performed according to the methods described previously (19Chao H. Sönnichsen F.D. DeLuca C.I. Sykes B.D. Davies P.L. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1760-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The culture was centrifuged at 4,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and then we sonicated the precipitated cell pellet containing the inclusion body of the AFP multimers. After the sonication, the fraction containing the AFP multimers was collected by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and then it was washed with 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA for three times, and dissolved into 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) containing 6 m guanidine hydrochloride at room temperature. Each dissolved AFP multimer was diluted with 50 mm K2HPO4 containing 100 mm NaCl (pH 10.7) at 4 °C followed by extensive dialysis against 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 3.7) at 4 °C. The precipitant formed during dialysis was removed occasionally by centrifugation. The supernatant containing AFP was loaded onto a high-S column (Bio-Rad), and the column-bound AFP was eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (0–0.5 m) using 50 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 3.7). The fractions containing the isolated AFP were stored and dialyzed against 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate (pH 7.9). The purity and the molecular weights (14 (dimer), 22 (trimers), and 29 kDa (tetramer)) of the samples were checked by 16% SDS-PAGE. Measurements of Thermal Hysteresis and Ice Crystal Morphology— The T f measurements were performed for the recombinant AFP multimers dissolved in 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate (pH 7.9) by using an osmometer (model OM 802, Vogel). The observation of ice crystal morphology and the T m determination were performed using an in-house photomicroscope system consisting of Leica DMLB 100 photomicroscope equipped with a Linkam LK600 (liquid nitrogen-type) temperature controller and a CCD camera. The measurements of T f and T m were repeated three times using the fresh samples, and the averaged values were used for determination of the TH activity (TH = T f – T m). The TH values of the multimers were examined as a function of the protein concentration ranging from 0.025 to 0.6 mm. For the observation of ice crystal morphology, a droplet (∼1.0 μl) of the sample solution was once frozen and subsequently heated until a single ice crystal was observed separately in the solution by manipulation of the temperature controller. The morphological change of the single ice crystal into a hexagonal bipyramid caused by the accumulations of AFP on the ice surfaces was then observed with the cooling rate of 0.01 °C per min. The ice crystal morphology observed under different temperatures, cooling rates, and elapses of time were recorded as a movie file on a personal computer. The sample volume and the cooling rate were kept constant through the measurements. We successfully prepared the samples of recombinant type III AFP multimers, such as RD3Nl as the monomer, RD3 and RD3NN as the dimers, RD3NCC, RD3NNC, and RD3NCN as the trimers, and RD3NCNC as the tetramer (Fig. 1), which were used for the measurements of TH activity and the observation of ice crystal morphology. Fig. 2a plots the TH activity (ΔT f (°C)) of the AFP multimers in the molar concentration range between 0 and 0.6 mm. As can be seen, the activity of the monomer (RD3Nl) is dramatically improved in the dimers (RD3 and RD3NN), and the activities of the dimers are further improved in the trimers (RD3NNC, RD3NCC, and RD3NCN). No significant difference in the TH activity was detected between the trimers and a tetramer (RD3NCNC), although the tetramer exhibits the highest activity. As a consequence, the activity curves of Fig. 2a were largely divided into three groups corresponding to monomer, dimers, and the others. Interestingly, it appeared that the TH activity curves of the multimers are sigmoid in shape, which might be ascribed to a kinetic icebinding process of the multimers. The differences between the activity curves of Fig. 2a are distinctly identified in Fig. 2b, which plots the TH activity ratio between ΔT f (multimers) and ΔT f (monomer). For the two recombinant dimers, it appeared that RD3NN is less active than RD3 in the concentration range between 0.02 and 0.2 mm. The maximum ratios of RD3 and RD3NN were estimated to be 8.4 and 6.5, respectively. Among the three trimers, RD3NNC and RD3NCC possessed almost identical activity through the whole concentration range, whereas RD3NCN did not catch up to the activity levels of the other two in the concentration range between 0.02 and 0.15 mm. The maximum ratios of RD3NNC, RD3NCC, and RD3NCN were estimated to be 22.6, 22.0, and 16.8, respectively. A small enhancement of the relative activity was distinctly detected between RD3NCNC and the others for a small range of AFP concentrations between 0.02 and 0.1 mm. The maximum ratio of RD3NCNC was estimated to be 24.6. Overall, the ΔT f (multimers)/ΔT f (monomer) ratio increases in keeping with the number of domain multiplications, although the two species that comprise the N-domain at the C-terminal end (i.e. RD3NN and RD3NCN) tends to lower the activity. Another significant observation of Fig. 2b is that the top position of each curve shifts to the lower concentration side with increasing the size of the multimers, suggesting that a larger size of the multimer exerts the maximum activity at a lower AFP concentration. It is noted that we have reported the detection of maximum 5.9-fold activity enhancements of RD3 compared with the monomer (17Miura K. Ohgiya S. Hoshino T Nemoto N. Suetake T. Miura A Spyracopoulos L. Kondo H. Tsuda S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1304-1310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). It appeared that our previous estimation is slightly insufficient presumably due to an imperfect dissolution of the protein before the TH measurements, and should be revised to maximum 8.4-fold enhancements in the present study. Fig. 2c shows the TH activity of the multimer plotted as a function of the “domain concentration,” in which the ΔT f values of the dimer, trimer, and tetramer are plotted against the molar concentration (mm) times 2, 3, and 4, respectively. This implies that the longitudinal axis of Fig. 2c represents a “per domain ΔT f,” so that the observed difference between the curves of Fig. 2c reflects the tandem repetition-induced change of the TH activity of an AFP domain comprised in a certain multimer. As can be seen in Fig. 2c, the per domain ΔT f values of every multimer are notably improved when compared with that of the monomer (RD3Nl). For dimers, it detected a difference in the profile between RD3 and RD3NN; the activity of the former is highly improved compared with the latter. For trimers, the highest and similar profiles of the per domain ΔT f curves are obtained for RD3NCC and RD3NNC, whereas less improvement is detected for RD3NCN. An interesting finding is that the activity profile of a tetramer RD3NCNC is almost identical to that of RD3, which implies that the TH activity of the tetramer is not significantly enhanced at a per domain level. It should be noted that in Fig. 2c the curves of the multimers are sigmoid in shape, and the species that comprise the N-domain at the C-terminal end tend to lower the activity as already described. It was indicated that both two ice-binding planes constructed in RD3 are able to interact with the prismic planes of a single hexagonal ice crystal, which results in the morphological change of the ice crystal into a unique bipyramidal shape (17Miura K. Ohgiya S. Hoshino T Nemoto N. Suetake T. Miura A Spyracopoulos L. Kondo H. Tsuda S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1304-1310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In the present study, the ice crystal morphology was examined for each water solution of the multimer under two different protein concentrations (0.003 and 0.05 mm). As shown in the photomicrographs of Fig. 3, every multimer changes the morphology of a single ice crystal into a diamond shape, which is closely similar to the ordinary hexagonal bipyramid observed for RD3 and various AFPs. Differently from the ordinary bipyramid, the ice crystals created by the multimers commonly lack the acute corners around the pyramidal junction that slightly protrudes to the a axis direction. It is also noted that the pyramidal plane acquires a slight curvature. As for RD3Nl, it does not create a bipyramidal ice crystal at the concentration of 0.003 mm, and it creates an incomplete bipyramid without acute tips when its concentration reaches 0.02 mm (Fig. 3). It is interesting to note that the c/a axial ratio is about 2 for RD3NN at the protein concentration of 0.003 mm, which slightly decreases in proportion with the size of the multimer, and is estimated to be 1.5 for RD3NCNC. Another significant observation is that the ice crystal size becomes dramatically small (1/3 to 1/4) only in the case of multimers by increasing their protein concentration from 0.003 to 0.05 mm. All of these data imply that a molecule comprising the multiple AFP domains connected in tandem acquires a unique manner of the ice binding. Here we examined the tandem repetition effects of the type III AFP domains on TH activity and ice crystal morphology, and we identified for the first time the following. (i) The TH activity increases in proportion with the size of the multimers. (ii) A larger size of the multimer exerts the maximum activity at lower concentrations. (iii) Every multimer changes the morphology of a single ice crystal into a unique shape that is similar but not identical to the ordinary hexagonal bipyramid. (iv) The size of ice crystal becomes dramatically small by increasing the concentration of the multimer. Interestingly, the TH activity curves against the protein concentrations are sigmoid in shape (Fig. 2), which is presumably a consequence of the kinetic ice binding process of each AFP multimer. Wen and Laursen (8Wen D. Laursen R.A. Biophys. J. 1992; 63: 1659-1662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) proposed a two-step ice-binding process of AFP, in which they assumed an existence of a reversible hydrogen-bonding mechanism between AFP and ice surface at a low range of AFP concentration. Once the AFP concentration becomes high, the AFP molecules on the ice surface begin to pack and interact with each other so as to increase a total affinity of the ice binding (2Yeh Y. Feeney R.E. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 601-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 8Wen D. Laursen R.A. Biophys. J. 1992; 63: 1659-1662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Chao et al. (20Chao H. DeLuca C.I. Davies P.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 357: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and DeLuca et al. (21DeLuca C.I. Comley R. Davies P.L. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 1502-1508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), however, reported that AFP molecules are independently active, and the protein-protein interaction is not an indispensable requirement for the tight binding to ice. For the present AFP multimers, on-rates of the consecutive ice bindings of the comprised domains should be significantly influenced by each other, since they are in close proximity by the connections through the linker sequences. Hence, the observations of the sigmoid curves of Fig. 2 would be attributed to “intra”-molecular cooperative interactions between the AFP domains of a multimer. It could be further assumed that the cooperative interactions are presumably strengthened in keeping with the number of domain multiplications and with the protein concentration as well. The TH activity enhancement therefore occurs at both molar and domain bases (Fig. 2), and the size of an ice crystal dramatically decreases by increasing the protein concentration of the multimer (Fig. 3). An interesting observation is that the largest enhancement of the TH activity was observed for the trimers but not for a tetramer; the maximum activity ratios of the two trimers (22.6 (RD3NNC) and 22.0 (RD3NCC)) are about 3-fold higher than that of a natural dimer (8.4 (RD3)) (Fig. 2b). In order to consider the present detected domain multiplication effects on the TH activity and ice crystal morphology from the three-dimensional structural viewpoint, we constructed model structures of the trimers and a tetramer based on our previous determinations of the NMR structure of RD3 (PDB code 1C8A) (17Miura K. Ohgiya S. Hoshino T Nemoto N. Suetake T. Miura A Spyracopoulos L. Kondo H. Tsuda S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1304-1310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 illustrates one of the model structures for RD3NCNC, in which (i) two molecules of RD3 are connected using the coordinates of the native RD3 linker sequence and (ii) the N-terminal three residues (-Asn-Lys-Ala-) are deleted from the second NC molecule, because these three residues do not exist in the second domain of native RD3 (16Wang X. DeVries A.L. Cheng C.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1247: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 17Miura K. Ohgiya S. Hoshino T Nemoto N. Suetake T. Miura A Spyracopoulos L. Kondo H. Tsuda S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1304-1310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The previous study demonstrated that the N- and C-domains of RD3 are laterally oriented with an angle of 32 ± 12°, and the ice binding plane of the N-domain is located ∼3.5 Å behind that of the C-domain in an averaged structure (17Miura K. Ohgiya S. Hoshino T Nemoto N. Suetake T. Miura A Spyracopoulos L. Kondo H. Tsuda S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1304-1310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it demonstrated that the linker portion is flexible and has an ability to bring the two ice-binding planes of RD3 to an allowed range of orientation; the two planes are presumably aligned with respect to the ice surface in the ice-bound form (17Miura K. Ohgiya S. Hoshino T Nemoto N. Suetake T. Miura A Spyracopoulos L. Kondo H. Tsuda S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1304-1310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These structural features are preserved in the model structure of RD3NCNC, leading to a twisted formation of the ice binding planes (indicated by ellipses in Fig. 4). For clarity, we rename this tetramer RD3N1C2N3C4 so as to indicate the ordinal numbers of the comprised domains. Suppose that this tetramer undertakes the manner of ice binding previously assumed for RD3 (17Miura K. Ohgiya S. Hoshino T Nemoto N. Suetake T. Miura A Spyracopoulos L. Kondo H. Tsuda S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1304-1310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), the C4-domain of RD3N1C2N3C4 located in front presumably binds first to the ice prism plane in the [0001] direction. The N3-domain may cause the second ice binding to the same prism plane in the [01¯11] direction, which is predicted by (i) position matches of the hydrophilic (15DeLuca C.I. Davies P.L. Ye Q. Zia Z. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 515-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and hydrophobic (22Baardsnes J. Davies P.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1601: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) atoms constructing the putative ice binding planes of the N3-domain with the spacing of water atoms of the ice prism plane and (ii) a 32° difference in the lateral alignment of the ice binding planes of the N3- and C4-domains (Ih: c axis = 7.361 Å; a axis = 4.507 Å; Ref. 23Hobbs P.V. Ice Physics. Oxford University Press, London1974: 18-39Google Scholar). Similarly, the 3rd ice binding of the C2-domain of RD3N1C2N3C4 is assumed against the same prism plane in the [21¯1¯1] direction, which is predicted by a total of ∼64° lateral alignment of the C2-domain against the C4-domain. The 4th ice binding of the N1-domain of RD3N1C2N3C4 might be further assumed against the same prism plane in the [21¯1¯0] direction. Obviously, it not possible to predict accurately the target ice surfaces of RD3NCNC especially for its third and fourth ice bindings, because it is extremely difficult to know the atom positions of putative ice binding residues in the AFP domains connected through the flexible linkers and their position matches with the water atom spacing of the ice {1011¯0} prism plane. Nevertheless, it is presumed that any domains of RD3NCNC possess the ability for specific ice binding to strengthen the interaction between the protein and ice, which is thought to be a key determinant to enhance the TH activity at molar and domain bases. Such an enhancement of the ice binding ability of the multimer is also identified by the change of the ice crystal morphology; the c/a-axial ratio becomes smaller by increasing the size of the multimer (Fig. 3). DeLuca et al. (21DeLuca C.I. Comley R. Davies P.L. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 1502-1508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) reported that genetically expressed type III AFP connected with thioredoxin (12 kDa) or maltose-binding protein (42 kDa) possessed only 2–3-fold higher TH activity than the type III AFP monomer. This small enhancement was ascribed to just a wider coverage of the ice surface pursued by the connected proteins that exhibit no antifreeze activity by themselves. The fact that the tetramer only slightly increases the molar basis TH activity (Fig. 2b) therefore suggests that there are significant imperfections of the ice binding between the fourth AFP domain and the ice crystal surface. One may attribute such imperfections to the structural and dynamic natures of the linker but not to an inherent ice binding ability of the fourth AFP domain. A notable observation is that the multimers containing the N-domain sequence at the C terminus (i.e. RD3NN and RD3NCN) significantly lower their TH activities (Fig. 2, b and c). One of the plausible explanations for this result is that the strength of ice binding is different between the N- and C-domains presumably due to their 20% sequence difference (16Wang X. DeVries A.L. Cheng C.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1247: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), although both of them construct a highly similar type III AFP structure (17Miura K. Ohgiya S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 1304-1310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) comprising the same numbers of the putative ice binding residues (Gln9, Asn14, Thr15, Thr18, and Gln44 for the N-domain and Gln79, Asn84, Thr85, Thr88, and Gln144 for the C-domain) (15DeLuca C.I. Davies P.L. Ye Q. Zia Z. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 515-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). It should be noted that the averaged order parameter (S2) of the backbone dynamics of the N-domain is slightly smaller than that of the C-domain (17Miura K. Ohgiya S. Hoshino T Nemoto N. Suetake T. Miura A Spyracopoulos L. Kondo H. Tsuda S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1304-1310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To summarize, we succeeded to synthesize intramolecular dimer, trimer, and tetramer of the type III AFP, and we examined their antifreeze activities. They exhibit a significant enhancement of thermal hysteresis on molar and domain bases and also an enhanced ability to modify the morphology and size of a single ice crystal. The present concept to design an activityenhanced variant of AFP by tandem repetitions of AFP domains is potentially applicable to any type of AFP (i.e. types I–IV and β-helical AFPs). Such approaches might realize a production of an artificial variant of AFP that exerts an extraordinary function.

https://openalex.org/W2006481663,"Cellular responses to low oxygen tension are mediated, at least in part, by the activation of the hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs). In the presence of oxygen, specific HIF residues become hydroxylated by the action of a recently described group of dioxygenases. These post-translational modifications target HIF for proteosomal degradation and prevent its transcriptional activity. Despite these detailed studies, little is known about the regulation of HIF by stimuli other than hypoxia. Here we report that, in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells, nerve growth factor (NGF) stimulation results in a decrease of both basal and hypoxia-induced levels of HIF-2α protein. NGF treatment did not increase HIF-hydroxylase gene expression or activity, and the reduction of the HIF-2α protein level upon stimulation was observed even in the presence of HIF-hydroxylase inhibitors such as deferoxamine or dimethyloxoglutarate. Thus, in contrast to the response to hypoxia, the effect of NGF on HIF-2α protein levels is not mediated by the HIF hydroxilases. Quantitative real time (RT)-PCR showed that NGF stimulation results in a decrease of the HIF-2α mRNA level similar to that found at the protein level. Interestingly, NGF effect was specific for HIF-2α mRNA because it did not affect HIF-1α mRNA levels. NGF treatment reduced HIF-2α mRNA levels even in the presence of actinomycin D, suggesting an effect on mRNA stability. Finally, the effect of NGF on HIF2α correlates with reduction of both basal and hypoxia-induced vascular endothelial growth factor mRNA levels. Reporter assays suggest that the reduced expression of hypoxia-inducible genes upon NGF treatment is related, at least in part, to the reduction of HIF-2α protein. Hence, in PC12 cells the level of HIF-2α protein and its effect on gene expression can be down-regulated by stimuli other than oxygen."

C99 can be cleaved by the γ-secretase to release Aβ and the APP intracellular domain (AID). Alternatively, AβPP can be cleaved within the Aβ sequence by the α-secretase creating a C83 membrane-bound intermediate which produces P3 and AID after γ-cleavage.

Thus, to find AβPP-binding proteins we employed the yeast two-hybrid selection system. This screening resulted in the identification of several proteins that bind the intracellular domain of AβPP. Here we report the novel AβPP interactor ARH, an adapter protein that has been shown to regulate cholesterol uptake by genetic studies (22Garcia C.K. Wilund K. Arca M. Zuliani G. Fellin R. Maioli M. Calandra S. Bertolini S. Cossu F. Grishin N. Barnes R. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. Science. 2001; 292: 1394-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). These data suggest that ARH may be a mediator of the well described effect of cholesterol metabolism on AβPP processing.MATERIALS AND METHODSYeast Two-hybrid System—The two-hybrid screening was conducted using the Matchmaker system from Clontech according to the manufacturer's instruction. For library screening, Yeast190 expressing GAL4BD-AID fusion proteins were transformed with a human fetal brain cDNA library cloned in the pACT2 vector (Clontech). 2 × 106 clones were analyzed. Transformed yeast were selected in synthetic drop-out plates lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine in the presence of 50 mm 3-aminotriazole (Sigma) and grown for 5 days at 30 °C. Colonies growing on selective media were scored as positive. Assays were done for eight independent transformants.cDNA Cloning and Constructs—The GAL4BD-AβPP bait was constructed using the pAS2 vector (Clontech) and consisted of the COOH-terminal 58 amino acids of AβPP fused to the DNA binding domain of GAL4, respectively. AβPP, AβPPNcas, and AID were made as described previously (16Passer B. Pellegrini L. Russo C. Siegel R.M. Lenardo M.J. Schettini G. Bachmann M. Tabaton M. D'Adamio L. J. Alzheimers Dis. 2000; 2: 289-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins were made in pGEX vectors (Amersham Biosciences). Mutations were introduced by using the transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit (Clontech).ARH, ARHth (clone AT60), ARHPTB (amino acid 48–175), and ARHΔPTB (amino acids 170–308) were cloned into pECFP-N1 (Clontech), pcDNA3.1, and FLAG-tagged pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) for expression in mammalian cells or in vitro. Fe65, Fe65N-PTB, and Fe65C-PTB were cloned in FLAG-pcDNA3. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing.Cell Lines and Transfections—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells were grown in RPMI 1640 media (Invitrogen) supplemented with glutamine and with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Biofluids; Rockville, MD). Transfections were performed in 6-well plates either using Metafectene (Biontex Laboratories Gmbh) with 3 μl per 1 μg of DNA.Northern Blot Analysis—A multitissue blot was purchased from Clontech, and it was hybridized with a 32P-labeled ARHPTB probe following the manufacturer's instruction. After washing, the blot was developed by autoradiography.GST Pull-down, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblot Analysis— Recombinant GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (Invitrogen) to make non-phosphorylated proteins and strain TKB1 (Stratagene) to make tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins using the pGEX system (Amersham Biosciences) (23Tarr P.E. Roncarati R. Pelicci G. Pelicci P.G. D'Adamio L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16798-16804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Proteins were purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads.For GST pull down of proteins produced in vitro (Fig. 2a), [3H]leucine-labeled proteins were made using the TnT-coupled in vitro transcription/translation system (Promega). After synthesis of the radiolabeled protein for 1.5 h, aliquots of the protein were incubated with GST fusion proteins bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads for 2 h at room temperature. The beads were then washed three times with lysis buffer T (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 45 mm NaCl) and boiled with SDS loading buffer with DTT. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the gel were fixed with 50% methanol, 40% H2O, 10% acetic acid. The gel was incubated in Amplify (Amersham Biosciences) for 20 min and dried, and signals were detected using autoradiography.For GST-pull down of proteins produced in vivo (Fig. 2b), HEK293 cells were lysed in lysis buffer T containing a protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Applied Science) 24–48 h following transfection. Lysis was allowed to continue for 10 min on ice and was then spun down at full speed at 4 °C for 10 min. Some lysate representing the total lysate was removed and boiled with SDS loading buffer with DTT, whereas the rest was pulled-down with GST fusion proteins. The beads were washed five times with lysis buffer and boiled with SDS loading buffer with DTT. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad). Membranes were probed with either αFLAG or rabbit polyclonal αARH (Zymed Laboratories Inc., new product catalog number 36-0400) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Southern Biotech). Proteins were detected using the Supersignal West Pico chemiluminescent system (Pierce).For immunoprecipitation from transfected cells, lysates were immunoprecipitated for2hat room temperature with the αFLAG monoclonal antibody bound to agarose beads (Sigma). After washing and SDS-PAGE, membranes were probed with either the 22C11 monoclonal antibody directed against the ectodomain of AβPP (Calbiochem) or rabbit polyclonal αARH.For co-precipitation of endogenous proteins, untransfected HEK293 cells were lysed as above. One mg of protein was used for immunoprecipitation with rabbit polyclonal αAPP COOH-terminal (Zymed Laboratories Inc., new product), rabbit polyclonal αARH, or rabbit antimouse IgG antibodies (ICN, Aurora, OH). Immunoprecipitations were performed overnight at 4 °C, followed by incubation of immunoprecipitates with protein A-agarose beads, washing, and immunoblot as described above.FRET Analysis—HEK293T cells were plated in 24-well plates and co-transfected with the CFP and YFP fusion proteins using Metafectene. All transfections contained ratios between the two cDNAs determined empirically to yield the best co-expression as follows. Cells were harvested between 18 and 24 h after transfection in their conditioned media. The analysis was performed as described previously (24Scheinfeld M.H. Roncarati R. Vito P. Lopez P.A. Abdallah M. D'Adamio L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3767-3775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar).RNA Interference—HEK293T cells were plated in 24-well plates and transfected with the following small interfering (si) RNA duplex using TransIT-TKO (Mirus): Scramble (CAGUCGCGUUUGCGACUGGdTdT and CCAGUCGCAAACGCGACUGdTdT); ARH (GCCUUGAGUGGCAGCAGUGdTdT and CACUGCUGCCACUCAAGGCdTdT); and AβPP (CUUGCAUGACUACGGCAUGdTdT and CAUGCCGUAGUCAUGCAAGdTdT).FACS Analysis—For FACS analysis HEK293 cells were collected with phosphate-buffered saline, 0.5 mm EDTA, washed once with FACS media (phosphate-buffered saline, 2% fetal bovine serum), and stained for 1 h at 4 °C in rotation with 2.5 μg/ml P2-1 antibody (BIOSOURCE 44-100) or with the IgG1 isotype control antibody P3 (gift of Dr. Porcelli). Cells were rinsed twice with FACS media and stained with Red-phycoerythrin-conjugated secondary antibody (Southern Biotech 1030-09). Cells were analyzed by FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTo identify proteins interacting with the cytoplasmic domain of AβPP, we have used the yeast two-hybrid selection system. This screening resulted in the identification of two independent clones coding for a novel protein (the interaction in yeast between AID and the representative AT60 clone is shown in Fig. 1a). Northern blot analysis showed that AT60 is expressed, albeit at different levels, in all human tissues analyzed (Fig. 1b). A recent blast search showed that AT60 is identical to the recently identified ARH adapter protein (22Garcia C.K. Wilund K. Arca M. Zuliani G. Fellin R. Maioli M. Calandra S. Bertolini S. Cossu F. Grishin N. Barnes R. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. Science. 2001; 292: 1394-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1c). Homozygous ARH mutations cause familial forms of autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia (ARH). ARH contains a phosphotyrosine-binding domain (PTB), which is known to interact with the PTB-binding motif present in the cytoplasmic tail of AβPP (682YENPTY687) (19Roncarati R. Sestan N.

Tyrosine phosphorylation of Tyr682 of AβPP is important for its interaction with ShcA and ShcC (23Tarr P.E. Roncarati R. Pelicci G. Pelicci P.G. D'Adamio L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16798-16804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). On the contrary, other binding partners interact with AβPP regardless of Tyr682 phosphorylation. Therefore, we sought to determined whether the PTB domain of ARH mediated binding to the 682YENPTY687 of AβPP and whether phosphorylation of AβPP was necessary for binding of ARHs. First, 3H-labeled ARH (ARHPTB), Fe65 COOH-terminal (Fe65C-PTB, which binds AβPP), and NH2-terminal (Fe65N-PTB, which does not bind AβPP, Refs. 28Fiore F. Zambrano N. Minopoli G. Donini V. Duilio A.

The protein-protein complexes were purified, resolved by gel electrophoresis, and visualized by autoradiography. Fig. 2a shows that GST-AID specifically and directly binds both ARHPTB and Fe65C-PTB but not Fe65N-PTB. Next, HEK293 cells were transfected with constructs expressing either ARH or ARHΔPTB (a mutant lacking the PTB domain) of FLAG-tagged Fe65. Cell lysates were incubated with GST-AID, GST-AID phosphorylated on Tyr682 (GST-AIDP), GST-AIDY682G (in which tyrosine682 was mutated to glycine), or GST, and pull downs were resolved by gel electrophoresis. Western blot analysis (Fig. 2b) using either αARH or αFLAG antibodies revealed that ARH, like Fe65, interacted with AID, whereas ARHΔPTB did not. We also found that, similarly to Fe65, AβPP binds ARH independent of Tyr682 phosphorylation, but this binding is abolished by the Y682G mutation.Fig. 1ARH interacts with the AβPP cytoplasmic region in yeast. a, the interaction between AT60 and AID in yeast is specific because AT60 does not interact with SV40 large T and AID does not bind p53. The interaction between p53 and large T is shown as a positive control. b, Northern blot analysis showing that AT60/ARH is ubiquitously expressed in adult human tissues. c, sequence alignment showing that AT60 is identical to ARH. The AT60 clone is missing the NH2terminal 32 amino acids of ARH. The PTB domain is indicated by the lighter shading. The Pro to Ser mutation may represent a polymorphism of ARH.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In further experiments, HEK293 cells were co-transfected with FLAG-ARH and the following AβPP constructs: wild type AβPP, AβPPNcas (an AβPP mutant lacking the COOH-terminal 31 amino acids that include the YENPTY motif), AβPPY682F (in which Tyr682 was mutated to phenylalanine), AβPPY687A (in which Tyr687 was mutated to alanine), or AβPPT653F (in which Thr653 was mutated to phenylalanine). Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with αFLAG monoclonal antibody and analyzed by Western blot. Fig. 3a shows that although FLAG-ARH immunoprecipitates AβPP, it does not immunoprecipitate AβPPNcas which lacks the YENPTY motif. Additionally, AβPPY682F mutation significantly affects the interaction with ARH.Fig. 3ARH interacts with AβPP in vivo. a, immunoblot analysis of AβPP and ARH proteins. Equal amounts of cell lysate (T.L.) from HEK293T cells transfected with the FLAG-tagged ARH and the indicated AβPP constructs. Expression of AβPP constructs was monitored by Western blot (W.B.) analysis with the anti-AβPP antibody 22C11 (W.B. αAβPP), whereas expression of ARH was assessed by hybridizing immunoblots with an anti-ARH antibody (W.B. αARH). Lysates from transfected cells were immunoprecipitated with the anti-FLAG antibody (I.P. αFLAG). After SDS-PAGE, immunoprecipitated samples were analyzed by Western blot using either an anti-ARH or anti-AβPP antibody. b, representative plot of CFP versus YFP to check for cotransfection efficiency (left panels). The R7 gate of each sample was used to calculate the percentage of co-transfected cells exhibiting FRET. Dot plots of representative samples show the presence or lack of FRET. Each plot represents a single co-transfection of the fusion proteins YFP-AID (Y-AID) with either CFP-ARHΔPTB (C-ARHΔPTB), or CFP-ARH (C-ARH). Each dot, representing a single cell, is plotted based on the intensity of the FRET signal's intensity versus its CFP emission (right column), or FRET versus YFP emission (middle panels). Cells falling in the upper right quadrant were scored as FRET-positive cells. Percentages are calculated as the number of FRET-positive cells divided by the total number of cells or, in parentheses, as the number of FRET positive cells divided by the number of co-transfected cells (R7 gate).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To detect interaction between ARH and AβPP in living cells, we used fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) (25Siegel R.M.

Siegel R.M. Zacharias D.A. Swofford R. Holmes K. Tsien R.Y. Lenardo M.J. Cytometry. 2001; 44: 361-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). HEK293T cells were co-transfected with yellow fluorescent protein-AID (Y-AID) and either cyan fluorescent protein-ARH (C-ARH) or C-ARHΔPTB fusion proteins. In FRET on living cells, if the proteins are in close proximity, on the order of 10 nm or less, the energy from the excitation of CFP will be transferred to YFP, and emission at the wavelength of YFP will be detected. If the proteins are not within this proximity, excitation of CFP is not transferred, and only emission at the wavelength of CFP is detected. Importantly, FRET was detected when Y-AID was co-transfected with C-ARH but not with C-ARHΔPTB. Altogether, these data indicate that ARH interacts with the YENPTY motif of AβPP through its PTB domain. Furthermore, this interaction is independent of Tyr682 phosphorylation but requires the presence of Tyr682.To determine whether endogenous AβPP and ARH interact, we immunoprecipitated HEK293 lysates either with an αAβPP or an αARH polyclonal antibody. As shown in Fig. 4, which is representative of data from two independent experiments, AβPP was immunoprecipitated with both αAβPP and αARH antibodies, whereas AβPP was not immunoprecipitated with a control rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibody (RαM). Similar findings were obtained with the reverse experiment, that is ARH was immunoprecipitated by the αAβPP and the αARH antibodies but not by the RαM IgG control. Altogether, these experiments indicate that endogenous AβPP and ARH associate.Fig. 4Endogenous AβPP and ARH interact in HEK293 cells. Immunoprecipitations (I.P.) were done with rabbit anti-mouse IgG (RαM), αAβPP (Zymed Laboratories Inc. anti-COOH-terminal AβPP domain), and αARH antibodies. Western blotting (W.B.) was done with either αARH or αAβPP ectodomain antibody 22C11.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine whether ARH physiologically regulates AβPP biology, we have repressed ARH protein expression in HEK293 cell using RNA interference (RNAi), which involves the transfection of small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes in cells. We have designed siRNAs duplex specific for human ARH, AβPP, and a duplex of unrelated scrambled sequence. As shown in Fig. 5a, ARH and AβPP siRNAs specifically reduce expression of ARH and AβPP proteins, respectively. Because ARH is involved in of low density lipoprotein receptors endocytosis, we next assessed whether ARH may regulate the cell surface levels of AβPP. To this end, we have performed FACS analysis experiments. The monoclonal antibody P2-1, which is specific for the ectodomain of human AβPP, was used in this experiment. The isotype-matched and unrelated monoclonal antibody P3 was used as a negative control. Viable cells were initially stained with either P2-1 or P3. After washing out the unbound antibody, cells were incubated with a phycoerythrin-labeled anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody and analyzed by FACS. P2-1 specifically binds to the cell surface AβPP of HEK293 cells as determined by three complementary facts: (i) the isotype-matched P3 antibody does not bind HEK293 cells (Fig. 5b); (ii) overexpression of AβPP in HEK293 cells increases P2-1 binding (Fig 5b); (iii) conversely, reduction of AβPP protein levels by RNAi results in decreased P2-1 binding (Fig. 5c). Of interest, reduction of ARH protein levels by RNAi results in increased amounts of AβPP on the cell membrane of HEK293 cells (Fig. 5c). These data indicate that ARH physiologically regulates the cell surface level of AβPP.Fig. 5ARH depletion results in increased cell membrane AβPP levels. a, HEK293 cells were transfected with the indicated siRNAs and analyzed by Western blot with the indicated antibodies 48 h later. b, endogenous AβPP expressed on the cell surface of HEK293 cells can be detected and quantitated using the anti-AβPP monoclonal antibody P2-1 in FACS analysis. The isotype control P3 does not stain these cells, and overexpression of AβPP (HEK293-AβPP) increases P2-1 staining. c, the levels of cell membrane AβPP are decreased in cells depleted of AβPP by RNAi. Conversely, reduction of ARH protein levels results in increase of cell surface AβPP. This experiment is representative of three independent experiments.

https://openalex.org/W2078247966,"In this work, we describe the process of cell death induced by a series of new benzo(b)thiophenesulphonamide 1,1-dioxide derivatives (BTS) that have been selected as candidate antineoplastic drugs. Human leukaemic CCRF-CEM cells incubated with BTS undergo a typical apoptotic process that includes cell shrinkage, phosphatidylserine translocation to the cell surface, mitochondrial dysfunction, caspase activation, chromatin condensation and internucleosomal DNA degradation. Mitochondrial alterations included dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential, oxidation of the phospholipid cardiolipin, release of cytochrome c and uncoupling of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, leading to a decrease of the intracellular ATP pool. Activation of caspase-8, -9 and -3 takes place during BTS-induced apoptosis. Either the addition of the specific caspase-8 inhibitor Z-IETD-fmk, or the overexpression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 significantly prevented BTS-induced apoptosis, suggesting the involvement of both caspase-8-regulated and mitochondria-dependent signalling pathways in this process. BTS induce a significant increase in the production and accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) that can be observed within minutes after drug addition. Moreover, cytochrome c release, caspase-3 activation and cell death can be completely abrogated by a previous incubation with the antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine. These results suggest that ROS are essential mediators in BTS-induced apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2028105130,"2-Aminopurine (2-AP) is an adenine analog shown to cause cells to bypass chemical- and radiation-induced cell cycle arrest through as-yet unidentified mechanisms. 2-AP has also been shown to act as a kinase inhibitor. Tumor suppressor p53 plays an important role in the control of cell cycle and apoptosis in response to genotoxic stress. We were interested in examining the effect of 2-AP on p53 phosphorylation and its possible consequences on checkpoint control in cells subjected to various forms of DNA damage. Here, we show that 2-AP suppresses p53 phosphorylation in response to gamma radiation, adriamycin, or ultraviolet treatment. This is partly explained by the ability of the kinase inhibitor to inhibit ATM or ATR activities in vitro and impair ATM- or ATR-dependent p53 phosphorylation in vivo. However, 2-AP is also capable of inhibiting p53 phosphorylation in cells deficient in ATM, DNA-PK, or ATR suggesting the existence of multiple pathways by which this kinase inhibitor modulates p53 activation. Biologically, the 2-AP-mediated inhibition of p53 stabilization enables wild-type p53-containing cells to bypass adriamycin-induced G2/M arrest. In the long term, however, 2-AP facilitates cells to resist DNA damage-induced cell death independently of p53."
