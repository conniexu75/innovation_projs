We developed a platform to interrogate the chromatin accessibility landscape and transcriptional program within neurons during degeneration. We provide evidence that neurons expressing the dipeptide repeat protein poly(proline-arginine), translated from the C9orf72 repeat expansion, activate a highly specific transcriptional program, exemplified by a single transcription factor, p53. Ablating p53 in mice completely rescued neurons from degeneration and markedly increased survival in a C9orf72 mouse model. p53 reduction also rescued axonal degeneration caused by poly(glycine-arginine), increased survival of C9orf72 ALS/FTD-patient-induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived motor neurons, and mitigated neurodegeneration in a C9orf72 fly model. We show that p53 activates a downstream transcriptional program, including Puma, which drives neurodegeneration. These data demonstrate a neurodegenerative mechanism dynamically regulated through transcription-factor-binding events and provide a framework to apply chromatin accessibility and transcription program profiles to neurodegeneration.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are two devastating neurodegenerative diseases. ALS is a motor neuron disease associated with motor impairments and paralysis, while FTD is associated with cognitive and behavioral impairments. Both diseases share some clinical overlap and also similar neuropathology, including aggregation of the RNA-binding protein TDP-43 in the brain and spinal cord of affected individuals (Neumann et al., 2006Neumann M. Sampathu D.M. Kwong L.K. Truax A.C. Micsenyi M.C. Chou T.T. Bruce J. Schuck T. Grossman M. Clark C.M. et al.Ubiquitinated TDP-43 in frontotemporal lobar degeneration and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.Science. 2006; 314: 130-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (3756) Google Scholar). The two diseases are also linked by genetics, including a mutation in the C9orf72 gene as the most common cause of both FTD and ALS (DeJesus-Hernandez et al., 2011DeJesus-Hernandez M. Mackenzie I.R. Boeve B.F. Boxer A.L. Baker M. Rutherford N.J. Nicholson A.M. Finch N.A. Flynn H.

The C9orf72 mutation is a large GGGGCC repeat expansion in the first intron of the gene. There are several different ways by which this mutation might cause disease (Gitler and Tsuiji, 2016Gitler A.D. Tsuiji H.

One way is by loss of function, resulting from decreased C9orf72 expression (DeJesus-Hernandez et al., 2011DeJesus-Hernandez M. Mackenzie I.R. Boeve B.F. Boxer A.L. Baker M. Rutherford N.J.

Another way is by the accumulation of GGGGCC-containing RNAs (and GGCCCC RNAs produced from the antisense transcript) that sequester critical RNA-binding proteins (Cooper-Knock et al., 2014Cooper-Knock J.

These DPRs include glycine-alanine (GA), glycine-proline (GP), glycine-arginine (GR), proline-arginine (PR), and proline-alanine (PA); they accumulate in the brains of patients with C9orf72 mutations, and some of them are cytotoxic in cell and animal models (Gitler and Tsuiji, 2016Gitler A.D.

On the other hand, these toxic DPRs could be key contributors to early facets of disease, but because they are so toxic, they would not be present at detectable levels at end stage. Emerging studies have suggested a role for alterations in epigenetic regulation in ALS and FTD, including DNA methylation, chromatin remodeling, and histone post-translational modification (Barry et al., 2011Barry S.

To explore the epigenetic landscape and cellular mechanisms driving neurodegeneration, we sought to define the programs of gene expression and their regulators within neurons in response to pathogenic protein accumulation. Gene expression is regulated by the binding of transcription factors (TFs) to specific DNA sequence motifs across the genome. TFs do not always have access to these binding sites, because the DNA is packaged into chromatin. The accessibility of these sites to TFs is tightly regulated. The assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) is a high-throughput method that quantifies regions of the genome with open chromatin sites—ones that are accessible to TFs and thus transcriptionally active (Buenrostro et al., 2013Buenrostro J.D.

Wu B. et al.An improved ATAC-seq protocol reduces background and enables interrogation of frozen tissues.Nat. Methods. 2017; 14: 959-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). This technique has been used to address a wide variety of biological questions, profiling the epigenetic features of chromatin state and DNA accessibility (Greenleaf, 2015Greenleaf W.J. Assaying the epigenome in limited numbers of cells.Methods. 2015; 72: 51-56Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Owing to technical difficulties, ATAC-seq has not yet been applied to primary neurons. To analyze the epigenomic landscape of neurodegeneration caused by ALS-associated protein aggregation, we developed a modified version of ATAC-seq that works on primary neurons. We discovered that C9orf72-ALS/FTD associated poly(PR) activated a remarkably specific signature of chromatin accessibility, involving transcriptional targets of the tumor suppressor gene p53. Our findings reveal an unexpected role of p53 as a mediator of neurodegeneration elicited by poly(PR) and provide an example of how ATAC-seq can now be applied to neurons to define mechanisms of neurodegeneration. Two ALS-associated proteins, TDP-43 and poly(PR) dipeptides produced from the C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansion, form aggregates, and cause degeneration in vitro and in vivo (Kwon et al., 2014Kwon I.

But do they do so by similar or different mechanisms? To obtain a comprehensive and integrative picture of the chromatin and transcriptional landscape of cortical neurons after ALS/FTD-associated protein accumulation, we set up an in vitro system where we could monitor neuronal cell death and axonal degeneration elicited by either poly(PR) or TDP-43 accumulation. We cultured embryonic day 16.5 (E16.5) mouse primary cortical neurons for 3 days to allow their processes to grow. We transduced them with lentiviruses expressing a 50-repeat poly(PR) protein, (PR)50, transactive response DNA binding protein 43 kDa (TDP-43), or green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a negative control (Figures 1A and S1A–S1J). Both (PR)50 and TDP-43 caused marked cell death and axonal degeneration 72 h after transduction. (PR)50- and TDP-43-expressing neurons formed numerous tubulin βIII puncta, indicating that microtubules disassembled, and the axons underwent degeneration (Figures 1C and 1D).Figure S1Cortical neurons expressing C9orf72 (PR)50 or TDP-43, related to Figure 1Show full caption(A–J) Cortical WT primary neurons were cultured for 3 days and treated with either C9orf72 (PR)50 or TDP-43 for additional 24h, 48h or 72h or left untreated. (PR)50 levels were elevated at both 48h and 72h of (PR)50 treated neurons, as detected using the anti-Flag antibody (A-B). TDP-43 levels were elevated at 24h (C-D and E-F), 48h (C-D and G-H) and 72h (I-J) of TDP-43 treated neurons, as detected using the anti-Flag antibody (C) and a specific anti TDP-43 (E, G and I) antibody. Quantitation of (PR)50 and TDP-43 was determined by immunoblots and normalized to actin (B, D, F, H and J).

Both TDP-43 and (PR)50 elicited neurodegeneration that looked grossly similar (Figures 1C and 1D), but we wondered whether the underlying chromatin regulation and gene expression programs driving degeneration were the same or different. ATAC-seq is a high-throughput method that quantifies regions of the genome with open chromatin sites—ones that are accessible to TFs and thus transcriptionally active. To probe chromatin accessibility in primary neurons, we developed a modified version of ATAC-seq. Recent methodological advances in the assay have enabled the generation of high-fidelity chromatin accessibility profiles for a variety of cell types (Corces et al., 2017Corces M.R. Trevino A.E. Hamilton E.G. Greenside P.G. Sinnott-Armstrong N.A. Vesuna S. Satpathy A.T. Rubin A.J. Montine K.S. Wu B. et al.An improved ATAC-seq protocol reduces background and enables interrogation of frozen tissues.Nat. Methods. 2017; 14: 959-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). However, so far, this assay has not been applied to primary neurons in vitro. The dissociation of cultured primary neurons, one of the first steps performed in the standard ATAC-seq protocol (Buenrostro et al., 2013Buenrostro J.D. Giresi P.G. Zaba L.C. Chang H.Y.

Methods. 2017; 14: 959-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), causes neuron death, which interferes with ATAC-seq results and motivated us to optimize the protocol for use with primary neurons (see STAR methods). Briefly, to avoid neuronal cell death as a result of dissociation, we instead used direct lysis of plated neurons, followed by isolation of released nuclei (Figures 1B and S2A–S2C). To probe chromatin accessibility, we harvested neurons 20, 40, and 60 h following transduction of (PR)50-, TDP-43-, or GFP-expressing lentiviruses. We chose these time points because they preceded the onset of neuronal morphological changes accompanying cell death and axonal degeneration. We performed sequential DNA and RNA extraction so we could obtain both regions of open chromatin (by ATAC-seq) as well as the transcriptional program of neurons in vitro (by RNA sequencing [RNA-seq]) (Figure 1B). Our ATAC-seq measurements of DNA accessibility displayed a wide array of changes during each treatment over the time course of the experiment. To track the differential DNA accessibility profiles, we used principal-component analysis (PCA) (Figures S2D and S2E). The first principal component (PC1) explains the greatest possible variance in the neuronal data, reflecting the changes in chromatin accessibility that occur in neurons in culture over time. PC2 explains the second greatest proportion of variance, reflecting accessibility changes that occur only at later time points (40 and 60 h) and specifically in neurons expressing TDP-43 or (PR)50 (Figures S2D and S2E). The first two PCs are used for visualization, since they capture most of the variation from the dataset. These differential variations reflect the neuronal chromatin accessibility response to (PR)50 and TDP-43 over time (Figures S2F–S2L). To characterize time-dependent modules of accessible chromatin regions, we first determined the most highly variable regions. We found 3,960 different genomic regions that showed high variability both at different time points and under different treatment conditions (Figure 1E). We used k-means clustering (k = 12) to identify different behaviors between the different conditions and time points. The clustering captures strong changes across time between all treatments, including gain of accessibility (clusters 6–10) and loss of accessibility (clusters 1–3). We detected loss of accessibility in TDP-43, (PR)50 and GFP treated neurons (compared to untreated neurons), across all time points (clusters 4 and 5). We also detected regions that were more accessible for TDP-43 at 60h (cluster 12) and at 40 and 60 h for (PR)50 (cluster 11) (Figure 1E). Thus, applying a modified version of the ATAC-seq protocol adapted for use with primary neurons, we generated diverse regulatory landscapes of neurodegeneration induced by the accumulation of distinct ALS-associated proteins. In addition to quantitative genome-wide information on chromatin accessibility, ATAC-seq also affords the opportunity to identify predicted TF-binding events located in the open chromatin regions (Schep et al., 2017Schep A.N.

Methods. 2017; 14: 975-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In other words, are there any TF sequence motifs enriched in the ATAC-seq peaks? To identify TF binding motifs that are enriched at differentially accessible regions in neurons expressing TDP-43, (PR)50, or GFP, we applied chromVAR (Figure 1F). This bioinformatic approach facilitates the analysis of chromatin accessibility data by estimating gain or loss of accessibility within peaks sharing the same motif, while controlling for technical biases (Schep et al., 2017Schep A.N. Wu B. Buenrostro J.D. Greenleaf W.J. chromVAR: inferring transcription-factor-associated accessibility from single-cell epigenomic data.Nat. Methods. 2017; 14: 975-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). We clustered the top 100 differential TFs according to their deviation scores. We observed many differences in TF accessibility at 60 h in neurons expressing TDP-43, but remarkably, only a single TF family, the p53 family (comprising p53, p63, and p73), was altered in C9orf72 (PR)50-treated neurons (Figure 1F). Indeed, when we examined predicted p53 family binding across the different clusters of ATAC-seq peaks, the p53, p63, and p73 binding motifs were significantly enriched only in cluster 11, the same cluster that captures the C9orf72 (PR)50 specific changes occurring after 40 and 60 h of treatment (Figure 1E). Furthermore, in cluster 11 p53 was the most enriched TF predicted to bind to the C9orf72 (PR)50 open regions (Figure 1G). Thus, whereas neurodegeneration induced by TDP-43 accumulation seems to involve activation of a diverse set of regulatory elements throughout the genome, mediated by a wide range of TFs, the response to C9orf72 (PR)50 is remarkably specific to regulatory elements enriched in binding sites for a single TF family, p53. The enrichment of predicted p53-binding sites in regions of open chromatin in neurons expressing (PR)50 suggests p53 is mediating the neuronal response, but it does not prove it. To provide direct evidence that p53 transcriptional targets are activated (or repressed) in neurons in response to (PR)50, we performed RNA-seq on (PR)50, TDP-43, and GFP-treated neurons at 20, 40, and 60 h. Visualizing RNA-seq data using PCA (Figures S3A and S3B) reveals that the largest amount of variation reflects neuronal gene changes that occur over time. PC2 reflects changes that occur only at later time points (40 and 60 h), capturing the divergence in neuronal responses to TDP-43 and (PR)50 compared with GFP-treated and untreated neurons (Figure S3A). Notably, the variation in gene expression between TDP-43 and (PR)50 mirrors the DNA accessibility data, underscoring unique footprints of chromatin accessibility and transcriptional programs in TDP-43- and (PR)50-treated neurons. Analyzing the differentially expressed genes in neurons after 60 h of (PR)50 treatment revealed that the most highly upregulated genes were Cdkn1a, Puma (Bbc3), Trp53inp1, Ccng1, Sulf2, and Fam212b (Figure 2A). Remarkably, these are all bona fide p53 target genes (Brady and Attardi, 2010Brady C.A. Attardi L.D. p53 at a glance.J. Cell Sci. 2010; 123: 2527-2532Crossref PubMed S"

Objective To investigate the association among social media exposure, risk perception, preventive behaviors, and attitudes toward the COVID-19 epidemic in Bolivia. Methods We launched an online survey in La Paz and El Alto, Bolivia, during April and May 2020. The questionnaire examined: Socio-demographic factors, Social media use, Risk Perception, Preventive behaviors, attitudes and the willingness to use a vaccine if it were available in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic. A logistic regression was used to evaluate factors associated with risk perception and a structural equation model (SEM) was performed to explore the pathway of the relationship among social media exposure, risk perception and preventive behaviors and attitudes. Results Among 886 participants, the most were young adults, between 18–25 years old (73.4%) and 577 (65.1%) were female. During the the week before the survey 387 (43.7%) reported be exposure to social media Covid-19 information almost always or always. Moreover 304 (34.3%) were categorized as with a high risk perception. The multivariable analyses show that being female (aOR = 1.5, CI 95% 1.1–2.1) and having high exposure to Covid-19 information on social media (aOR = 2.5, CI 95% 1.3–5.3) were associated with a higher risk perception for Covid-19. Furthermore, SEM results indicated that risk perception is associated with the adoption of preventive behaviors and attitudes (β = 0.605, p &lt; 0.001) including the acceptance of a vaccine if one were available (β = 0.388, p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion Social media exposure to COVID-19 information influences the adoption of preventive attitudes and behaviors through shaping risk perception. Understanding the role of social media during the pandemic could help policymakers and communicators to develop better communication strategies that enable the population to adopt appropriate attitudes and behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W3125337135,"Introduction Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging respiratory infections and is known to cause illness ranging from the common cold to severe acute respiratory syndrome. At present, the disease has been posing a serious threat to the communities, and it is critical to know the communities’ level of adherence on COVID-19 prevention measures. Thus, this study aimed to identify the predictors of adherence to COVID-19 prevention measure among communities in North Shoa zone, Ethiopia by using a health belief model. Methods Community-based cross-sectional study design was employed. A total of 683 respondents were interviewed using a structured and pre-tested questionnaire. The data were collected by using a mobile-based application called “Google form.” Logistic regression was performed to analyze the data. Estimates were reported in adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and a significant association was declared at p-value of less than 0.05. Result The overall adherence level of the community towards the recommended safety measures of COVID-19 was 44.1%. Self-efficacy (AOR = 0.23; 95% 0.14, 0.36), perceived benefits (AOR = 0.35; 95% 0.23, 0.56), perceived barriers (AOR = 3.36; 95% 2.23, 5.10), and perceived susceptibility of COVID-19 (AOR = 1.60; 95% 1.06, 2.39) were important predictors that influenced the adherence of the community to COVID-19 preventive behaviors. Conclusions In this study, the overall adherence level of the community towards the recommended safety measures of COVID-19 was relatively low. It is vital to consider the communities’ self-efficacy, perceived benefits, perceived barriers and perceived susceptibility of COVID-19 in order to improve the adherence of the community towards the recommended safety measures of COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3122324317,"Neural stem cells (NSCs) in the adult brain transit from the quiescent state to proliferation to produce new neurons. The mechanisms regulating this transition in freely behaving animals are, however, poorly understood. We customized in vivo imaging protocols to follow NSCs for several days up to months, observing their activation kinetics in freely behaving mice. Strikingly, NSC division is more frequent during daylight and is inhibited by darkness-induced melatonin signaling. The inhibition of melatonin receptors affected intracellular Ca2+ dynamics and promoted NSC activation. We further discovered a Ca2+ signature of quiescent versus activated NSCs and showed that several microenvironmental signals converge on intracellular Ca2+ pathways to regulate NSC quiescence and activation. In vivo NSC-specific optogenetic modulation of Ca2+ fluxes to mimic quiescent-state-like Ca2+ dynamics in freely behaving mice blocked NSC activation and maintained their quiescence, pointing to the regulatory mechanisms mediating NSC activation in freely behaving animals."
https://openalex.org/W3126118283,"The subthalamic nucleus (STN) supports action selection by inhibiting all motor programs except the desired one. Recent evidence suggests that STN can also cancel an already selected action when goals change, a key aspect of cognitive control. However, there is little neurophysiological evidence for dissociation between selecting and cancelling actions in the human STN. We recorded single neurons in the STN of humans performing a stop-signal task. Movement-related neurons suppressed their activity during successful stopping, whereas stop-signal neurons activated at low-latencies near the stop-signal reaction time. In contrast, STN and motor-cortical beta-bursting occurred only later in the stopping process. Task-related neuronal properties varied by recording location from dorsolateral movement to ventromedial stop-signal tuning. Therefore, action selection and cancellation coexist in STN but are anatomically segregated. These results show that human ventromedial STN neurons carry fast stop-related signals suitable for implementing cognitive control."

https://openalex.org/W3124794456,"Workload in the nursing profession is high, which is associated with poor health. Thus, it is important to get a proper understanding of the working situation and to analyse factors which might be able to mitigate the negative effects of such a high workload. In Germany, many people with serious or life-threatening illnesses are treated in non-specialized palliative care settings such as nursing homes, hospitals and outpatient care. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the buffering role of resources on the relationship between workload and burnout among nurses. A nationwide cross-sectional survey was applied. The questionnaire included parts of the Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire (COPSOQ) (scale ‘quantitative demands’ measuring workload, scale ‘burnout’, various scales to resources), the resilience questionnaire RS-13 and single self-developed questions. Bivariate and moderator analyses were performed. Palliative care aspects, such as the ‘extent of palliative care’, were incorporated to the analyses as covariates. 497 nurses participated. Nurses who reported ‘workplace commitment’, a ‘good working team’ and ‘recognition from supervisor’ conveyed a weaker association between ‘quantitative demands’ and ‘burnout’ than those who did not. On average, nurses spend 20% of their working time with palliative care. Spending more time than this was associated with ‘burnout’. The results of our study imply a buffering role of different resources on burnout. Additionally, the study reveals that the ‘extent of palliative care’ may have an impact on nurse burnout, and should be considered in future studies."

This has been challenged, however, by research demonstrating growth of E . coli in the environment. In this study, we used whole genome sequencing to investigate the links between E . coli and recent faecal contamination in drinking water. We sequenced 103 E . coli isolates sampled from 9 water supplies in rural Kitui County, Kenya, including points of collection (n = 14) and use (n = 30). Biomarkers for definitive source tracking remain elusive, so we analysed the phylogenetic grouping, multi-locus sequence types (MLSTs), allelic diversity, and virulence and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes of the isolates for insight into their likely source. Phylogroup B1, which is generally better adapted to water environments, is dominant in our samples (n = 69) and allelic diversity differences (z = 2.12, p = 0.03) suggest that naturalised populations may be particularly relevant at collection points with lower E . coli concentrations (&lt;50 / 100mL). The strains that are more likely to have originated from human and/or recent faecal contamination (n = 50), were found at poorly protected collection points (4 sites) or at points of use (12 sites). We discuss the difficulty of interpreting health risk from E . coli grab samples, especially at household level, and our findings support the use of E . coli risk categories and encourage monitoring that accounts for sanitary conditions and temporal variability."

However, cross-species comparisons are missing on site-specific effective connectivity between regions important for cognition. We harnessed functional imaging to visualize the effects of direct electrical brain stimulation in macaque monkeys and human neurosurgery patients. We discovered comparable effective connectivity between caudal auditory cortex and both ventro-lateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC, including area 44) and parahippocampal cortex in both species. Human-specific differences were clearest in the form of stronger hemispheric lateralization effects. In humans, electrical tractography revealed remarkably rapid evoked potentials in VLPFC following auditory cortex stimulation and speech sounds drove VLPFC, consistent with prior evidence in monkeys of direct auditory cortex projections to homologous vocalization-responsive regions. The results identify a common effective connectivity signature in human and nonhuman primates, which from auditory cortex appears equally direct to VLPFC and indirect to the hippocampus.Video Abstracthttps://www.cell.com/cms/asset/0cb19785-ae66-4024-baaf-2dce151c2412/mmc5.mp4Loading ...(mp4, 19.89 MB) Download video"
https://openalex.org/W3121772290,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is an oncogenic human herpesvirus that persists as a multicopy episome in proliferating host cells. Episome maintenance is strictly dependent on EBNA1, a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein with no known enzymatic activities. Here, we show that EBNA1 forms a cell cycle-dependent DNA crosslink with the EBV origin of plasmid replication oriP. EBNA1 tyrosine 518 (Y518) is essential for crosslinking to oriP and functionally required for episome maintenance and generation of EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). Mechanistically, Y518 is required for replication fork termination at oriP in vivo and for formation of SDS-resistant complexes in vitro. EBNA1-DNA crosslinking corresponds to single-strand endonuclease activity specific to DNA structures enriched at replication-termination sites, such as 4-way junctions. These findings reveal that EBNA1 forms tyrosine-dependent DNA-protein crosslinks and single-strand cleavage at oriP required for replication termination and viral episome maintenance."
https://openalex.org/W3121520215,"Urban scaling and Zipf’s law are two fundamental paradigms for the science of cities. These laws have mostly been investigated independently and are often perceived as disassociated matters. Here we present a large scale investigation about the connection between these two laws using population and GDP data from almost five thousand consistently-defined cities in 96 countries. We empirically demonstrate that both laws are tied to each other and derive an expression relating the urban scaling and Zipf exponents. This expression captures the average tendency of the empirical relation between both exponents, and simulations yield very similar results to the real data after accounting for random variations. We find that while the vast majority of countries exhibit increasing returns to scale of urban GDP, this effect is less pronounced in countries with fewer small cities and more metropolises (small Zipf exponent) than in countries with a more uneven number of small and large cities (large Zipf exponent). Our research puts forward the idea that urban scaling does not solely emerge from intra-city processes, as population distribution and scaling of urban GDP are correlated to each other."
https://openalex.org/W3122143120,"Introduction Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the most common and serious ocular complications in both developed and developing countries. To date, epidemiological data of DR and their associated factors in Southeast Asian countries especially in Thailand are scarce. We aimed to use the information from the Thailand Diabetes Mellitus/Hypertension (DM/HT) study to determine trends in DR prevalence and also risk factors among Thai patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Methods A series of cross-sectional surveys of clinical outcomes was conducted annually in 2014, 2015 and 2018 among patients with T2D aged &gt;18 years receiving medical care for at least 12 months. A stratified single stage cluster sampling method that was proportional to the size sampling technique was used to select a nationally and provincially representative sample of patients with T2D in Thailand. A standardized case report form was used to obtain the required information from medical records. Results A total of 104,472 Thai patients with T2D were included in the study from 2014 to 2018. The dominant proportion of participants, 70,756 (67.7%), were females. The overall prevalence of DR declined from 6.9% in 2014 to 6.3% in 2015 and 5.0% in 2018 ( p for trend &lt;0.001). The independent associated factors with DR included survey year, greater duration of DM, geographic region, hospital level, social security scheme, dyslipidemia, insulin therapy, high HbA1c level and elevated pulse pressure. Conclusion We reported a decreasing in trend in the prevalence of DR among Thai patients with T2D over one half decade. Patients with T2D should be encouraged to control their underlying diseases and engage in other effective interventions. When these modifiable risk factors can be inhibited, DR and other cardiovascular complications will be alleviated."

Method In total, 405 women with singleton pregnancies complicated with PPROM were included. Cervical fluid and amniotic fluid samples were collected at the time of admission. Bacterial and G . vaginalis DNA were assessed in the cervical fluid samples using quantitative PCR technique. Concentrations of interleukin-6 and MIAC were evaluated in the amniotic fluid samples. Loads of G . vaginalis DNA ≥ 1% of the total cervical bacterial DNA were used to define the cervical prevalence of G . vaginalis as abundant. Based on the MIAC and IAI, women were categorized into four groups: with intra-amniotic infection (both MIAC and IAI), with sterile IAI (IAI without MIAC), with MIAC without IAI, and without either MIAC or IAI. Results The presence of the abundant cervical G . vaginalis was related to MIAC (with: 65% vs. without: 44%; p = 0.0004) but not IAI (with: 52% vs. without: 48%; p = 0.70). Women with MIAC without IAI had the highest load of the cervical G . vaginalis DNA (median 2.0 × 10 4 copies DNA/mL) and the highest presence of abundant cervical G . vaginalis (73%). Conclusions In women with PPROM, the presence of cervical G . vaginalis was associated with MIAC, mainly without the concurrent presence of IAI."
https://openalex.org/W3124927515,"Knowledge of the mechanisms of assembly of amyloid proteins into aggregates is of central importance in building an understanding of neurodegenerative disease. Given that oligomeric intermediates formed during the aggregation reaction are believed to be the major toxic species, methods to track such intermediates are clearly needed. Here we present a method, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), by which the amount of intermediates can be measured over the course of the aggregation, directly in the reacting solution, without the need for separation. We use this approach to investigate the aggregation of α-synuclein (αS), a synaptic protein implicated in Parkinson’s disease and find a large population of oligomeric species. Our results show that these are primary oligomers, formed directly from monomeric species, rather than oligomers formed by secondary nucleation processes, and that they are short-lived, the majority of them dissociates rather than converts to fibrils. As demonstrated here, EPR offers the means to detect such short-lived intermediate species directly in situ. As it relies only on the change in size of the detected species, it will be applicable to a wide range of self-assembling systems, making accessible the kinetics of intermediates and thus allowing the determination of their rates of formation and conversion, key processes in the self-assembly reaction."

https://openalex.org/W3122696681,"Background The number of hospitalized young coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients has increased significantly. However, specific data about COVID-19 patients under 65 years old who are admitted to the hospital are scarce. Methods The COVID-19 patients under 65 years old who were admitted to the hospital in Sichuan Province, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, and Wuhan Red Cross Hospital were included in this study. Demographic information, laboratory data and clinical treatment courses were extracted from electronic medical records. Risk factors associated with oxygen therapy were explored. Results Eight hundred thirty-three COVID-19 patients under 65 years old were included. Of the included patients, 29.4% had one or more comorbidities. Oxygen therapy was required in 63.1% of these patients, and the mortality was 2.9% among the oxygen therapy patients. Fever (odds ratio [OR] 2.072, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.312–3.271, p = 0.002), dyspnea (OR 2.522, 95% CI 1.213–5.243, p = 0.013), chest distress (OR 2.278, 95% CI 1.160–4.473, p = 0.017), elevated respiratory rate (OR 1.114, 95% CI 1.010–1.228, p = 0.031), and decreased albumin (OR 0.932, 95% CI 0.880–0.987, p = 0.016) and globulin levels (OR 0.929, 95% 0.881–0.980, p = 0.007) were independent factors related to oxygen therapy. Conclusions Oxygen therapy is highly required in COVID-19 patients under 65 years old who are admitted to the hospital, but the success rate is high.

https://openalex.org/W3123880896,"The novel coronavirus responsible for COVID-19 was first identified in Hubei Province, China in December, 2019. Within a matter of months the virus had spread and become a global pandemic. In addition to international air travel, local travel (e.g. by passenger car) contributes to the geographic spread of COVID-19. We modify the common susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) virus spread model and investigate the extent to which short-term travel associated with driving influences the spread of the virus. We consider the case study of the US state of Minnesota, and calibrated the proposed model with travel and viral spread data. Using our modified SEIR model that considers local short-term travel, we are able to better explain the virus spread than using the long-term travel SEIR model. Short-term travel associated with driving is predicted to be a significant contributor to the historical and future spread of COVID-19. The calibrated model also predicts the proportion of infections that were detected. We find that if driving trips remain at current levels, a substantial increase in COVID-19 cases may be observed in Minnesota, while decreasing intrastate travel could help contain the virus spread."
https://openalex.org/W3121260763,"Prematurity (gestational age <37 completed weeks) accounts for the majority of neonatal deaths worldwide and most of these occur in the low-resource countries. Understanding factors that determine the best chances of preterm survival is imperative in order to enhance the care of neonates and reduce adverse outcomes in such complicated births.This was to find out the proportions of preterm babies who survived at the Special Care Baby Unit (SCBU) in the Cape Coast Teaching Hospital (CCTH) and the factors which influenced their survival.This was a retrospective review of data on all the live preterm babies seen at the SCBU of CCTH from 2010 to 2019. Data on 2,254 babies that met the inclusion criteria were extracted. Descriptive statistics were generated and tests of association done with chi-square and multivariable logistic regression.The main outcome measure was the proportion of live preterm neonates who were discharged after SCBU admissions.The CCTH had a total of 27,320 deliveries from 2010 to 2019. Of these, 1,282 were live preterm births, giving a prevalence of live preterm babies over the ten-year period of 4.7% (1,282/27,320). An increasing trend in prevalence was observed with 2019 recording the highest at 9% (271/3027). Most (48.8%) of the deliveries were vaginal, 39.2% were by caesarean section (CS); the mode of birth for 12% of the women were not documented. The mean gestational age was 31.8 (±2.77) weeks. Of the birth weights documented, <1000g babies accounted for 11.9%, 1000-1499g babies made up 34.8%, while 1500g to 2499g babies accounted for 42.6%. The babies with weights >2500g made up only 3.7%. The average length of hospital stay was 8.3 (±9.88) days. Regarding the main outcome variable, 67.6% were discharged alive, 27.6% died and 4.9% were unaccounted for due to incomplete documentation. Factors which influenced survival were: birth weight (p <0.001); gestational age (p <0.001); mode and place of delivery (p <0.001 for both); APGAR scores at 1st and 5th minutes (p <0.001); and length of stay at the SCBU (p <0.001). No association was found for sex of the baby, maternal age and parity.This study shows the possibility of achieving good preterm survival rates through the provision of specialised neonatal care, even in resource-constrained countries. This provides an updated benchmark for clinical decision-making and antenatal counselling. It also highlights the problem of inadequate data capture in our part of the world, which needs considerable improvement."
https://openalex.org/W3121987425,"Silvopasture is the deliberate integration of a woody component with grazed pastures as understorey. It is one of the most extended agroforestry practices all over the world. Silvopasture use is key to increase the sustainability of livestock farming systems as silvopasture reduces the use of concentrates since the woody component provides feed for animals. However, it is not an extensively used practice in Europe. This paper aims at evaluating, from Eurostat, LUCAS database and the 118 rural development programs, the current situation of permanent grasslands in the Mediterranean area of Europe as well as the rural development programmes fostering silvopasture to better understand how sustainable land use systems are promoted and provide insights to foster silvopasture across Europe. The results of this study show that most of the policy measures related to silvopasture are adapted to the local necessity. The already existing agroforestry managed land (dehesas/montado) are related to measures supporting regeneration and maintenance while in those areas where agroforestry does not exist the measures are related to forest fire prevention."
https://openalex.org/W3122184701,"Background Large inter-individual variations in drug metabolism pose a challenge in determining 6-mercaptopurine (6MP) doses. As the last product of 6MP metabolism, DNA-thioguanine nucleotide (DNA-TGN) could reflect the efficacy of 6MP, especially in patients harboring variants in the 6MP metabolism pathway. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical significance of DNA-TGN monitoring in Korean pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients, focusing on the NUDT15 genotype. Methods The subjects of this study were patients who underwent ALL treatment with 6MP. Tests for the NUDT15 and TPMT genotypes were performed, and prospective DNA-TGN and erythrocyte TGN samples were collected after two weeks or more of 6MP treatment. DNA-TGN was quantified using the liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method. Results A total of 471 DNA-TGN measurements in 71 patients were analyzed, which ranged from 1.0 to 903.1 fmol thioguanine/μg DNA. The 6MP intensity demonstrated a significant relationship with DNA-TGN concentration ( P &lt;0.001). Patients harboring NUDT15 variants were treated with a lower dose of 6MP ( P &lt;0.001); however, there was no significant difference in DNA-TGN concentration when compared to patients carrying wild-type NUDT15 ( P = 0.261). These patients also presented higher variation in DNA-TGN levels ( P = 0.002) and DNA-TGN/6MP intensity ( P = 0.019) compared to patients carrying wild-type NUDT15 . DNA-TGN concentration did not show a significant correlation with WBC count ( P = 0.093). Conclusions Patients harboring NUDT15 variants demonstrated similar DNA-TGN concentrations even at low doses of 6MP and showed high variability in DNA-TGN. Particularly in patients with NUDT15 variants who need a reduced 6MP dose, DNA-TGN could be applied as a useful marker to monitor the therapeutic effect of 6MP."

Therefore, mitochondrial DNA suffers more oxidative damage than its nuclear counterpart. Formation of a repair enzyme complex is beneficial to DNA repair. Recent studies have shown that mitochondrial DNA polymerase (Pol γ) and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) were found in the same complex along with other mitochondrial DNA repair enzymes, and mitochondrial PARP1 level is correlated with mtDNA integrity. However, the molecular basis for the functional connection between Pol γ and PARP1 has not yet been elucidated because cellular functions of PARP1 in DNA repair are intertwined with metabolism via NAD+ (nicotinamide adenosine dinucleotide), the substrate of PARP1, and a metabolic cofactor. To dissect the direct effect of PARP1 on mtDNA from the secondary perturbation of metabolism, we report here biochemical studies that recapitulated Pol γ PARylation observed in cells and showed that PARP1 regulates Pol γ activity during DNA repair in a metabolic cofactor NAD+ (nicotinamide adenosine dinucleotide)-dependent manner. In the absence of NAD+, PARP1 completely inhibits Pol γ, while increasing NAD+ levels to a physiological concentration that enables Pol γ to resume maximum repair activity. Because cellular NAD+ levels are linked to metabolism and to ATP production via oxidative phosphorylation, our results suggest that mtDNA damage repair is coupled to cellular metabolic state and the integrity of the respiratory chain.

Therefore, mitochondrial DNA suffers more oxidative damage than its nuclear counterpart. Formation of a repair enzyme complex is beneficial to DNA repair. Recent studies have shown that mitochondrial DNA polymerase (Pol γ) and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) were found in the same complex along with other mitochondrial DNA repair enzymes, and mitochondrial PARP1 level is correlated with mtDNA integrity. However, the molecular basis for the functional connection between Pol γ and PARP1 has not yet been elucidated because cellular functions of PARP1 in DNA repair are intertwined with metabolism via NAD+ (nicotinamide adenosine dinucleotide), the substrate of PARP1, and a metabolic cofactor. To dissect the direct effect of PARP1 on mtDNA from the secondary perturbation of metabolism, we report here biochemical studies that recapitulated Pol γ PARylation observed in cells and showed that PARP1 regulates Pol γ activity during DNA repair in a metabolic cofactor NAD+ (nicotinamide adenosine dinucleotide)-dependent manner. In the absence of NAD+, PARP1 completely inhibits Pol γ, while increasing NAD+ levels to a physiological concentration that enables Pol γ to resume maximum repair activity. Because cellular NAD+ levels are linked to metabolism and to ATP production via oxidative phosphorylation, our results suggest that mtDNA damage repair is coupled to cellular metabolic state and the integrity of the respiratory chain. The oxidative environment of mitochondria results in more damage on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) than its nuclear counterpart (1Brown W.M. George Jr., M. Wilson A.C. Rapid evolution of animal mitochondrial DNA.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1967-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (2241) Google Scholar, 2Brown W.M. Prager E.M. Wang A. Wilson A.C. Mitochondrial DNA sequences of primates: Tempo and mode of evolution.J. Mol. Evol. 1982; 18: 225-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar). Most of the oxidative damage to mtDNA is restored via base excision repair (mtBER), which, like nuclear BER, can be functionally grouped into three distinct steps: (1) lesion recognition, (2) gap tailoring, and (3) DNA synthesis/ligation (3Almeida K.H. Sobol R.W. A unified view of base excision repair: Lesion-dependent protein complexes regulated by post-translational modification.DNA Repair (Amst). 2007; 6: 695-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Although mtBER lesion recognition occurs similarly to nuclear BER, the pathway subsequently diverges. For example, a mitochondria-specific endo/exonuclease G, excises a dinucleotide from the 5’-end of the DNA intermediate in gap-tailoring, generating a DNA gap larger than a single nucleotide. In contrast to specialized DNA polymerases in the nucleus, the mitochondrial DNA polymerase (Pol γ) that is responsible for DNA replication also acts in gap-filling DNA synthesis in mtBER (4Copeland W.C. The mitochondrial DNA polymerase in health and disease.Subcell. Biochem. 2010; 50: 211-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The regulatory mechanisms that govern Pol γ functional conversion have not been illustrated. Poly(ADP-Ribose) (PAR) polymerase 1 (PARP1) is a first responder to DNA strand breaks by serving as a key scaffolding protein in recruitment of other repair enzymes to the lesion site and assembling a repair complex around the lesion DNA (5Masson M.

In the complex, PARP1 uses NAD+ to catalyze poly(ADP-ribosylation) on itself (auto-PARylation) and target proteins (trans-PARylation). PARylation activity of PARP1 was discovered in nucleus more than 50 years ago, then later found in mitochondria, first in extracts of Xenopous oocytes (9Burzio L.O. Koide S.S.

Mono(ADP-ribosylation) in rat liver mitochondria.Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 529-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). An interactor molecule, Mitofilin, has been shown to control PARP-1 transport into mitochondria (18Rossi M.N. Carbone M. Mostocotto C. Mancone C. Tripodi M. Maione R. Amati P.

These studies provide substantial evidence for mitochondrial localization of PARP-1 and imply that PARP-1 may affect mtDNA via Pol γ. Despite its mitochondrial localization, the function of PARP-1 during mtDNA repair is disputed in cellular studies. For instance, mtDNA integrity increased when PARP-1 was knocked down (13Szczesny B. Brunyanszki A. Olah G. Mitra S. Szabo C.

PARP1 depletion improves mitochondrial and heart dysfunction in Chagas disease: Effects on POLG dependent mtDNA maintenance.PLoS Pathog. 2018; 15e1007065Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar), suggesting PARP-1 negatively impacts mtDNA integrity. Opposing results show that mtDNA stability reduces following PARP1 knockdown (18Rossi M.N. Carbone M. Mostocotto C. Mancone C. Tripodi M. Maione R. Amati P.

Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase offers protection against oxidative and alkylation damage to the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes of the retinal pigment epithelium.Ophthalmic Res. 2007; 39: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and the addition of PARP-1 inhibitor augments UV-induced damage on mtDNA (20Hegedus C.

PARP1 inhibition augments UVB-mediated mitochondrial changes-implications for UV-induced DNA repair and photocarcinogenesis.Cancers (Basel). 2019; 12: 5Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar), all suggesting PARP1 contributes positively to mtDNA integrity. The complicated PARP-1 cellular effects are likely because of multiple roles of NAD+ as substrate of PARP-1 and a metabolic cofactor. Intramitochondrial PARP1 resulted in NAD+ depletion and lead to metabolic disorder, reduced ATP production, and cell death (15Du L. Zhang X. Han Y.Y. Burke N.A. Kochanek P.M. Watkins S.C. Graham S.H. Carcillo J.A. Szabo C. Clark R.S. Intra-mitochondrial poly(ADP-ribosylation) contributes to NAD+ depletion and cell death induced by oxidative stress.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18426-18433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). To begin dissecting PARP1 function in mtDNA repair, away from its role in metabolism, we conducted biochemical studies to investigate the activity of PARP1 during mtDNA repair and how it affects Pol γ functionality. We report here that PARP1 differentially affects Pol γ in replication and repair. While having little impact on Pol γ during replication, PARP1 regulates Pol γ repair activity in a NAD-dependent manner. Pol γ is a substrate for PARP1, and PARylation is essential for PARP1 regulation of Pol γ repair activities. Our studies thus revealed a crosstalk between mtDNA repair and cellular metabolism. To recapitulate the interaction of PARP1 and Pol γ in mitochondrial lysate by co-immunoprecipitation (11Wen J.J. Yin Y.W. Garg N.J. PARP1 depletion improves mitochondrial and heart dysfunction in Chagas disease: Effects on POLG dependent mtDNA maintenance.PLoS Pathog. 2018; 15e1007065Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar), we performed binding assays utilizing purified PARP1 and Pol γ with or without a 75-nt dumbbell DNA containing a 3-nt gap. The gapped DNA was designed based on activity of the mitochondrial-specific endo/exonuclease G, which excises two-nucleotides from the 5’-end of the gap of duplex DNA in mtBER, thereby creating 3-nt gapped DNA repair intermediate (21Cymerman I.A. Chung I. Beckmann B.M. Bujnicki J.M. Meiss G.

Exonuclease of human DNA polymerase gamma disengages its strand displacement function.Mitochondrion. 2013; 13: 592-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) that mimics a mtDNA BER intermediate (Fig. S1A). The 25 bp upstream of the gap meets the minimum required length for binding of Pol γ, and the 6 bp downstream of DNA gap was found to be sufficient for binding of PARP1 (24Johnson A.A. Tsai Y. Graves S.W. Johnson K.A.

Biol. 1989; 210: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Pol γ, a heterotrimeric holoenzyme consisting of a catalytic subunit Pol γA and a dimeric accessory subunit Pol γB, has high affinity to the 3’-end of the primer DNA. Binary complexes of Pol γ-DNA and PARP1-DNA were first measured using nano-isothermocalorimetry (nano-ITC). At 25 °C, the enthalpy for PARP1-DNA binary complex was −58.4 kcal/mol, and the dissociation constant (Kd) was calculated to be 36.4 nM (Fig. S1A). There was no measurable ΔH for Pol γ binding to DNA at 25 °C (Fig. S1B). Because Pol γ was shown to bind this DNA substrate under these conditions (discussed in the following paragraph), we concluded that the binding is isothermal at 25 °C, which simplified evaluation of the Pol γ–PARP1–DNA ternary complex. The calculated Kd for the ternary complex was 111 nM (Fig. S1C) with enthalpy ΔHPARP1:Pol γ:DNA −61.4 kcal/mol, similar to the measured enthalpy of the PARP1–DNA binary complex. These results suggest formation of PARP1–Pol γ–DNA ternary complex, and binding is entropically driven (Fig. S1D). The lower affinity of the ternary complex relative to either binary complex (24Johnson A.A. Tsai Y. Graves S.W. Johnson K.A. Human mitochondrial DNA polymerase holoenzyme: Reconstitution and characterization.Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1702-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) may be because of steric hindrance of Pol γA Pol and PARP1 Zn2 domain simultaneously binding to the same DNA gap (26Szymanski M.R. Kuznetsov V.B. Shumate C. Meng Q. Lee Y.S. Patel G. Patel S. Yin Y.W.

Planck J.L. Roy S. Pascal J.M. Crystal structures of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) zinc fingers bound to DNA: Structural and functional insights into DNA-dependent PARP-1 activity.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 10690-10701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Protein–protein interaction was measured by titrating PARP-1 into Pol γ (5 μM). No enthalpy was detected at maximum concentration of PARP-1 (final 10 μM), indicating the two proteins have low or no affinity to each other, with a Kd value greater than 10 μM (Fig. S1E). In comparision to their Kd value of 111 nM in the presence of DNA, the binding studies suggest the Pol γ–PARP1 interaction is mediated by DNA. As multicomponent binding constants are difficult to deconvolute from isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) data, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) to visualize complex formation directly. EMSA supershift assays were performed by titrating increasing amounts of PARP1 into a constant quantity of Pol γ–DNA complex. A super-shifted species emerged that migrated differently from either PARP1–DNA or Pol γ–DNA complexes. The quantity of this species is positively correlated with PARP1 concentration (Fig. S2, A and B). To identify the components in the super-shifted species, Western blot (WB) was performed using antibody against Pol γ. When PARP1 is added, the super-shifted band contains Pol γ. The binding assays were carried out using substoichiometric amount of Pol γ to DNA (2:3 M ratio) so that only one Pol γ is bound to each DNA substrate. Therefore, the super-shifted Pol γ-DNA complex most likely also contains PARP1. The super-shifted species dissociated upon addition of NAD back to Pol γ-DNA binary complex (Fig. S2C, lane 4–5), and addition of PARP1 inhibitor, Olaparib, prevented NAD+-induced dissociation (Fig. S2C, lane 10). These results suggest that PARP1 protein forms a stable complex with Pol γ–DNA, and this binding is decreased by PARylation activity. Results from ITC and EMSA results indicating that Pol γ and PARP1 form a complex on the gapped DNA are in good agreement with in vivo observations of PARP1 co-localization with Pol γ in mitochondria by co-immunoprecipitation (11Wen J.J. Yin Y.W. Garg N.J. PARP1 depletion improves mitochondrial and heart dysfunction in Chagas disease: Effects on POLG dependent mtDNA maintenance.PLoS Pathog. 2018; 15e1007065Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and proximity ligation assays (13Szczesny B. Brunyanszki A. Olah G. Mitra S. Szabo C. Opposing roles of mitochondrial and nuclear PARP1 in the regulation of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA integrity: Implications for the regulation of mitochondrial function.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42: 13161-13173Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To examine whether co-localization with PARP1 results in PARylation of Pol γ, WB analyses were carried out using antibodies against Pol γ, PARP-1, and PAR (poly(ADP-ribose)). A DNA with accessible 5’end is essential for PARP1 robust PARylation activity; the minimum length of DNA for PARP1 activity is 8 bp (29Fischer J.M. Popp O. Gebhard D. Veith S. Fischbach A. Beneke S. Leitenstorfer A. Bergemann J. Scheffner M. Ferrando-May E. Mangerich A. Bürkle A. Poly(ADP-ribose)-mediated interplay of XPA and PARP1 leads to reciprocal regulation of protein function.FEBS J. 2014; 281: 3625-3641Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To determine Pol γ PARylation and whether co-localization with PARP1 is essential for the activity, we used two DNA substrates, the dumbbell 3-nt gapped DNA that can accommodate both PARP1 and Pol γ shown by ITC and EMSA analyses and an 8 bp self-annealing DNA duplex that is sufficient to stimulate PARP1 activity but is only long enough to bind PARP1 alone (29Fischer J.M. Popp O. Gebhard D. Veith S. Fischbach A. Beneke S. Leitenstorfer A. Bergemann J. Scheffner M. Ferrando-May E. Mangerich A. Bürkle A. Poly(ADP-ribose)-mediated interplay of XPA and PARP1 leads to reciprocal regulation of protein function.FEBS J. 2014; 281: 3625-3641Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). PARylation reaction products could potentially contain both PARylated and unmodified PARP1 and Pol γ. The heterogeneous nature of the PAR chains results in smearing on denaturing PAGE, thus PARylated Pol γ and PARP1 species could potentially overlap on the gel. Therefore, WBs were performed using antibodies against PARP1 and Pol γ sequentially on the same membrane to distinguish each PARylated species. PARylation reactions were carried out at increasing concentrations of NAD+ (20–2000 μM). The WB showed that PARP1 auto-PARylation was equally robust on both DNA substrates and was clearly evident at 20 μM NAD+ (Fig. 1B, most clearly evidenced by the loss of the unmodified species in the discrete band). Auto-PARylation intensified with increasing concentrations of NAD+, plateauing around a physiological concentration of NAD+ at 200 μM (Fig. 1, B and D) (30Loetscher P. Alvarez-Gonzalez R. Althaus F.R. Poly(ADP-ribose) may signal changing metabolic conditions to the chromatin of mammalian cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Regulation of corepressor function by nuclear NADH.Science. 2002; 295: 1895-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). By contrast, trans-PARylation of Pol γ differed significantly on the two DNA substrates. On the 8 bp duplex, only a small amount of short PAR chains was observed and only at 2000 μM NAD+ (Fig. 1A), whereas on the gapped DNA, Pol γ PARylation began at 20 μM NAD+ and increased sharply at 200 μM NAD+ (Fig. 1C). No PARylation was observed in the absence of DNA (Fig. S6, furthest lane on the right). This follows logically as PARP1 catalytic activity is stimulated >1000 fold in the presence of DNA (32Prasad R. Caglayan M. Dai D.P. Nadalutti C.A. Zhao M.L. Gassman N.R. Janoshazi A.K. Stefanick D.F. Horton J.K. Krasich R. Longley M.J. Copeland W.C. Griffith J.D. Wilson S.H. DNA polymerase beta: A missing link of the base excision repair machinery in mammalian mitochondria.DNA Repair (Amst.). 2017; 60: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These results suggest that at physiological concentrations of NAD+, Pol γ was PARylated more readily when bound to the same gapped DNA as PARP1 than when free in solution. Interestingly, lack of trans-PARylation did not lead to an increase in auto-PARylated PARP1, suggesting that PARP1 catalyzes auto-PARylation and trans-PARylation as two separate reactions and without preference. The results indicate that Pol γ is a bona fide substrate for PARP1, and trans-PARylation of Pol γ shown in cellular studies (11Wen J.J. Yin Y.W. Garg N.J.

To examine the biological effects of PARP1 interaction and PARylation on Pol γ activity, we investigated Pol γ gap-filling synthesis, an essential activity in DNA repair (Fig. 2C) (21Cymerman I.A. Chung I. Beckmann B.M. Bujnicki J.M. Meiss G. EXOG, a novel paralog of endonuclease G in higher eukaryotes.Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 1369-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 22Szymanski M.R. Yu W. Gmyrek A.M.

Two products can be seen: the gap-filled product and a product from short strand displacement synthesis that has been previously identified (23He Q. Shumate C.K. White M.A. Molineux I.J. Yin Y.W. Exonuclease of human DNA polymerase gamma disengages its strand displacement function.Mitochondrion. 2013; 13: 592-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). As the strand displacement activity was not a focus of this study, we did not differentiate between the two product bands. Pol γ alone efficiently synthesized into the 3-nt DNA gap (Fig. 2A). Addition of stochiometric amount of PARP1 (without NAD+) completely inhibited Pol γ gap-filling activity (Fig. 2B, Lane 2). The diminished Pol γ activity is most likely because of PARP1 obstructing Pol γ from accessing the template in the DNA gap. To examine the effects of PARylation, NAD+ was titrated into the reaction mixture. As NAD+ concentration increases, beginning at 50 μM NAD+, Pol γ gap-filling activity was gradually recovered (Fig. 2B, Lanes 3–7, Fig. 2D) and reached a maximum at 200 μM. Further increasing NAD+ to 2000 μM offers negligible benefit (Fig. 2, B and D). NAD+ itself has no effect on Pol γ activity (Fig. 2, A and D). These results, along with those presented in Figure 1, suggest that PARP1 binding inhibits Pol γ activity, and NAD+-dependent auto- and trans-PARylation under physiological conditions regulates the PARP1–Pol γ interaction in favor of Pol γ activity. Recent studies suggest that the human nuclear BER polymerase, Pol β, could be localized in mitochondria (32Prasad R. Caglayan M. Dai D.P. Nadalutti C.A. Zhao M.L. Gassman N.R. Janoshazi A.K.

We thus tested the effect of PARP1 on Pol β gap-filling activity. Similar to results from Pol γ, Pol β activity is also inhibited by PARP1, and gap-filling synthesis is restored by the addition of NAD+ (Fig. S3, A and B), consistent with the previous report (34Sukhanova M.V.

Like Pol γ, Pol β was PARylated at a NAD+ concentration (200 μM) much higher than that required (20 μM NAD+) for gap-filling synthesis (Fig. S3, A and C), indicating PARylation of the polymerases is not essential for the activity. Our results suggest BER gap-filling synthesis is regulated by PARP1 and NAD+, regardless of which polymerase performs it. To confirm PARylation is a key regulator for the PARP1–Pol γ interaction, we added to the reaction a PARP inhibitor, Olaparib, which competes with NAD+, thus obliterating PARP1 PARylation activity. Olaparib completely abolishes the NAD+ rescuing effect for both DNA polymerases tested (Fig. 2B, Lane 8; Fig. S3A, lane 8), confirming the catalytic activity of PARP1 is involved in regulation of Pol γ and Pol β activities. The above results imp"

This study aimed to identify the prevalence of school policies and practices related to physical activity (PA) and their association with Thai students’ overall and domain specific PA. This cross-sectional analysis included 5,830 students aged 6–17 years from 136 schools recruited though a multi-stage stratified cluster sampling across Thailand. Student’s PA data were assessed using a student survey and school data were collected by a principal survey. Associations between students’ PA and school variables were examined using logistic regressions. Despite a high prevalence of Thai schools reporting many policies and practices promoting PA in different areas, students reported low levels of PA. None of the school PA policies and practices was associated with students’ overall and domain specific activities, with active transport as the one exception. When schools had an active transport policy, students were 40% (OR = 1.40, p = 0.01) more likely to travel actively to/from school. The identified positive relationship between school active transport policy and students’ active travel behavior suggests a potential wider adoption of the policy promoting school active transport aiming to increase student’s PA levels among all Thai schools. Intervention studies are necessary to confirm this finding. Our study also reflected that, for greater levels of children’s school-based PA, strategies to translate the existing school PA policies into effective implementation should be an emphasis for Thai schools."

An extensive survey of five major grapevine viruses in the country was carried out in 2019. A total of 630 samples from the two dominant autochthonous cultivars, named Žilavka and Blatina, were tested by DAS-ELISA for the presence of grapevine leafroll-associated viruses (GLRaV-1 and 3), grapevine fleck virus (GFkV), grapevine fanleaf virus (GFLV) and Arabis mosaic virus (ArMV). Eighty-eight % of the samples were positive for at least one virus, and all five viruses were detected, thought with different incidence, i.e. GLRaV-3 (84%), GFLV (43%), GLRaV-1 (14%), GFkV (10%) and ArMV (0.2%). The majority of infected plants (about 75%) were asymptomatic. Specific virus symptoms were observed in the remaining infected plants, together with the reported GLRaV vectors, Planococcus ficus and Parthenolecanium corni , while nematodes of the Xiphinema genus were not found in the GFLV- or ArMV-infected vineyards. The GLRaV-3 CP phylogenetic analyses showed 75–100% nucleotide identity between the BiH and reference isolates, and the BiH isolates clustered into the major group. The dNS/dS ratio indicated a negative selection of the virus population, and the lack of geographical structuring within the population was observed. In addition, putative GLRaV-3 recombinants with breakpoints in the 5’ of the CP gene were detected, while no recombinant strains were identified for the other four viruses. The obtained results indicate a deteriorated sanitary status of the cultivated grapevines, the prevalence and intraspecies genetic diversity of GLRaV-3 throughout the country. The establishment of certified grapevine material and adequate virus vector control is therefore of primary importance to prevent further spread of these viruses. This study presents the results of the first molecular characterisation of grapevine viruses in Bosnia and Herzegovina."
https://openalex.org/W3122249035,"SARS-CoV-2 is a single stranded RNA (ssRNA) virus and contains GU-rich sequences distributed abundantly in the genome. In COVID-19, the infection and immune hyperactivation causes accumulation of inflammatory immune cells, blood clots, and protein aggregates in lung fluid, increased lung alveolar wall thickness, and upregulation of serum cytokine levels. A serum protein called serum amyloid P (SAP) has a calming effect on the innate immune system and shows efficacy as a therapeutic for fibrosis in animal models and clinical trials. Here we show that aspiration of the GU-rich ssRNA oligonucleotide ORN06 into mouse lungs induces all of the above COVID-19-like symptoms. Men tend to have more severe COVID-19 symptoms than women, and in the aspirated ORN06 model, male mice tended to have more severe symptoms than female mice. Intraperitoneal injections of SAP starting from day 1 post ORN06 aspiration attenuated the ORN06-induced increase in the number of inflammatory cells and formation of clot-like aggregates in the mouse lung fluid, reduced ORN06-increased alveolar wall thickness and accumulation of exudates in the alveolar airspace, and attenuated an ORN06-induced upregulation of the inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12p70, IL-23, and IL-27 in serum. SAP also reduced D-dimer levels in the lung fluid. In human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, SAP attenuated ORN06-induced extracellular accumulation of IL-6. Together, these results suggest that aspiration of ORN06 is a simple model for both COVID-19 as well as cytokine storm in general, and that SAP is a potential therapeutic for diseases with COVID-19-like symptoms and/or a cytokine storm."
https://openalex.org/W3122326816,"Cooking with polluting and inefficient fuels and technologies is responsible for a large set of global harms, ranging from health and time losses among the billions of people who are energy poor, to environmental degradation at a regional and global scale. This paper presents a new decision-support model–the BAR-HAP Tool–that is aimed at guiding planning of policy interventions to accelerate transitions towards cleaner cooking fuels and technologies. The conceptual model behind BAR-HAP lies in a framework of costs and benefits that is holistic and comprehensive, allows consideration of multiple policy interventions (subsidies, financing, bans, and behavior change communication), and realistically accounts for partial adoption and use of improved cooking technology. It incorporates evidence from recent efforts to characterize the relevant set of parameters that determine those costs and benefits, including those related to intervention effectiveness. Practical aspects of the tool were modified based on feedback from a pilot testing workshop with multisectoral users in Nepal. To demonstrate the functionality of the BAR-HAP tool, we present illustrative calculations related to several cooking transitions in the context of Nepal. In accounting for the multifaceted nature of the issue of household air pollution, the BAR-HAP model is expected to facilitate cross-sector dialogue and problem-solving to address this major health, environment and development challenge."
https://openalex.org/W3124418414,"Introduction Routine viral load (VL) testing among persons living with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (PLHIV) enables earlier detection of sub-optimal antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence and for appropriate management of treatment failure. Since adoption of this policy by Zimbabwe in 2016, the extent of implementation is unclear. Therefore we set out to determine among PLHIV ever enrolled on ART from 2004–2017 and in ART care for ≥12 months at health facilities providing ART in Zimbabwe: numbers (proportions) with VL testing uptake, VL suppression and subsequently switched to 2 nd -line ART following confirmed virologic failure. Materials and methods We used retrospective data from the electronic Patient Monitoring System (ePMS) in which PLHIV on ART are registered at 525 public and 4 private health facilities. Results Among the 392,832 PLHIV in ART care for ≥12 months, 99,721 (25.4%) had an initial VL test done and results available of whom 81,932 (82%) were virally suppressed. Among those with a VL&gt;1000 copies/mL; 6,689 (37.2%) had a follow-up VL test and 4,086 (61%) had unsuppressed VLs of whom only 1,749 (42.8%) were switched to 2 nd -line ART. Lower age particularly adolescents (10–19 years) were more likely (ARR 1.34; 95%CI: 1.25–1.44) to have virologic failure. Conclusion The study findings provide insights to implementation gaps including limitations in VL testing; low identification of high- risk PLHIV in care and lack of prompt utilization of test results. The use of electronic patient-level data has demonstrated its usefulness in assessing the performance of the national VL testing program. By end of 2017 implementation of VL testing was sub-optimal, and virological failure was relatively common, particularly among adolescents. Of concern is evidence of failure to act on VL test results that were received. A quality improvement initiative has been planned in response to these findings and its effect on patient management will be monitored."
https://openalex.org/W3124776802,"Elevated plasma triglycerides are a risk factor for coronary artery disease, which is the leading cause of death worldwide. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) reduces triglycerides in the blood by hydrolyzing them from triglyceride-rich lipoproteins to release free fatty acids. LPL activity is regulated in a nutritionally responsive manner by macromolecular inhibitors including angiopoietin-like proteins 3 and 4 (ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4). However, the mechanism by which ANGPTL3 inhibits LPL is unclear, in part due to challenges in obtaining pure protein for study. We used a new purification protocol for the N-terminal domain of ANGPTL3, removing a DNA contaminant, and found DNA-free ANGPTL3 showed enhanced inhibition of LPL. Structural analysis showed that ANGPTL3 formed elongated, flexible trimers and hexamers that did not interconvert. ANGPTL4 formed only elongated flexible trimers. We compared the inhibition of ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4 using human very-low-density lipoproteins as a substrate and found both were noncompetitive inhibitors. The inhibition constants for the trimeric ANGPTL3 (7.5 ± 0.7 nM) and ANGPTL4 (3.6 ± 1.0 nM) were only 2-fold different. Heparin has previously been reported to interfere with ANGPTL3 binding to LPL, so we questioned if the negatively charged heparin was acting in a similar fashion to the DNA contaminant. We found that ANGPTL3 inhibition is abolished by binding to low-molecular-weight heparin, whereas ANGPTL4 inhibition is not. Our data show new similarities and differences in how ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4 regulate LPL and opens new avenues of investigating the effect of heparin on LPL inhibition by ANGPTL3.

Our data show new similarities and differences in how ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4 regulate LPL and opens new avenues of investigating the effect of heparin on LPL inhibition by ANGPTL3. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) plays a central role in the regulation of whole-body energy balance by hydrolyzing triglycerides from circulating lipoproteins to provide free fatty acids to tissues. LPL activity is differentially regulated in adipose versus muscle tissue depending on nutritional state in order to ensure appropriate distribution of available energy throughout the body (1Dijk W. Kersten S. Regulation of lipid metabolism by angiopoietin-like proteins.Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2016; 27: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Specifically, LPL activity is downregulated in adipose tissue during fasting to direct triglyceride-rich lipoproteins to muscle tissue for fatty acid oxidation (2Fried S.K. Hill J.O. Nickel M. DiGirolamo M. Prolonged effects of fasting-refeeding on rat adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase activity: Influence of caloric restriction during refeeding.J.

The influence of starvation and refeeding on the lipoprotein lipase activity of skeletal muscle and adipose tissue of lean and obese Zucker rats.J. Nutr. 1983; 113: 1150-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Conversely, in the postprandial state, LPL activity increases in adipose tissue but decreases in muscle tissue. This allows utilization of glucose by muscle tissue and fat storage in adipose tissue (3Quig D.W. Layman D.K. Bechtel P.J. Hackler L.R. The influence of starvation and refeeding on the lipoprotein lipase activity of skeletal muscle and adipose tissue of lean and obese Zucker rats.J. Nutr. 1983; 113: 1150-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This tissue-specific regulation is facilitated by three members of the angiopoietin-like protein (ANGPTL) family of proteins: ANGPTL3, ANGPTL4, and ANGPTL8 (4Zhang R. The ANGPTL3-4-8 model, a molecular mechanism for triglyceride trafficking.Open Biol. 2016; 6: 150272Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Each protein is an inhibitor of LPL, and each has a different pattern of expression. ANGPTL3 is highly expressed in the liver and is largely insensitive to nutritional state (5Conklin D. Gilbertson D. Taft D.W. Maurer M.F. Whitmore T.E. Smith D.L. Walker K.M. Chen L.H. Wattler S. Nehls M. Lewis K.B. Identification of a mammalian angiopoietin-related protein expressed specifically in liver.Genomics. 1999; 62: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Upon fasting, ANGPTL4 is upregulated in the adipose tissue (6Kersten S. Mandard S. Tan N.S. Escher P. Metzger D. Chambon P. Gonzalez F.J. Desvergne B. Wahli W.

Recent work has shown that ANGPTL8 can also form a complex with ANGPTL4 that prevents LPL inhibition (11Chen Y.Q. Pottanat T.G. Siegel R.W. Ehsani M. Qian Y.W. Zhen E.Y. Regmi A. Roell W.C. Guo H.

Genome-wide association studies in humans have identified robust links between lipid profiles and variants in ANGPTL3, ANGPTL4, and ANGPTL8. Mutations resulting in the loss of ANGPTL3 function are associated with lower plasma triglycerides and protection from coronary artery disease (CAD) (12Stitziel N.O. Khera A.V. Wang X. Bierhals A.J.

However, high circulating levels of ANGPTL8 were found to be associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular events (18Leiherer A. Ebner J. Muendlein A. Brandtner E.M. Zach C. Geiger K. Fraunberger P.

ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4 have similarities that extend beyond their effects on lipid profiles in humans. They are both secreted proteins with many similar structural characteristics and share 29% sequence identity. Both have an N-terminal coiled-coil domain and a C-terminal fibrinogen-like domain separated by a furin cleavage site (19Essalmani R. Susan-Resiga D. Chamberland A. Asselin M.C. Canuel M. Constam D.

Within this N-terminal domain, both ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4 share a conserved LPL inhibition motif (23Lee E.C. Desai U. Gololobov G. Hong S. Feng X. Yu X.C. Gay J. Wilganowski N. Gao C. Du L.L. Chen J.

One unanswered question is why the two inhibitors show such different potencies in vitro. Another unanswered question surrounds the structure and oligomeric form of the N-terminal domains of both inhibitors, which are not known.

Differences have also been observed in the abilities of ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4 to inhibit LPL in the presence of other proteins and additives. For example, heparin was found to protect LPL from inhibition by ANGPTL3 but not from inhibition by ANGPTL4 (24Shan L. Yu X.C. Liu Z. Hu Y. Sturgis L.T. Miranda M.L. Liu Q.

Crystal structures of the C-terminal fibrinogen like domains of both ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4 have been resolved, but little is known about the structure and oligomeric states of the N-terminal domains of both proteins (31Biterova E. Esmaeeli M. Alanen H.I. Saaranen M. Ruddock L.W. Structures of Angptl3 and Angptl4, modulators of triglyceride levels and coronary artery disease.Sci. Rep. 2018; 8: 6752Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). One study showed that the N-terminal domains of both ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4 elute from size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) in a broad peak of high-molecular-weight oligomers (32Ge H. Cha J.Y. Gopal H.

Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 1484-1490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In a later study, SEC suggested that the N-terminal domain of ANGPTL4 forms hexamers (24Shan L. Yu X.C. Liu Z. Hu Y. Sturgis L.T. Miranda M.L. Liu Q. The angiopoietin-like proteins ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4 inhibit lipoprotein lipase activity through distinct mechanisms.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 1419-1424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). By contrast, a study that compared the apparent molecular weight of wildtype, mammalian-produced N-terminal domain ANGPTL4 using reducing and nonreducing SDS-PAGE found that ANGPTL4 formed disulfide-bonded dimers and tetramers (20Yin W. Romeo S. Chang S. Grishin N.V. Hobbs H.H. Cohen J.C. Genetic variation in ANGPTL4 provides insights into protein processing and function.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 13213-13222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In this work, we undertook a biochemical and biophysical study of the N-terminal domains of ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4 to address these outstanding questions. We found that ANGPTL3 associates with a DNA contaminant and removal of this DNA contaminant enhances ANGPTL3 inhibition of LPL. We found that ANGPTL3 adopts two distinct oligomeric states, hexamer and trimer, whereas ANGPTL4 was only observed as a trimer by SEC–multiangle light scattering (MALS). Using small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) we found both ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4 adopt elongated and flexible structures in solution. We assessed the mechanism of LPL inhibition by both ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4 on human very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) using an enzyme-coupled reaction to report on real-time liberation of free fatty acids. This revealed both ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4 are noncompetitive inhibitors. We also investigated the different effects heparin has on ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4 inhibition. These data provide new insight into how these two inhibitors influence LPL activity. In previous in vitro studies, ANGPTL3 was shown to be a less potent inhibitor of LPL than ANGPTL4 (24Shan L.

Most of these studies used the N-terminal domain of ANGPTL3 (∼26 kDa) recombinantly produced in Escherichia coli and purified using nickel chromatography (24Shan L. Yu X.C. Liu Z. Hu Y. Sturgis L.T.

Liu Z. Hu Y. Sturgis L.T. Miranda M.L. Liu Q. The angiopoietin-like proteins ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4 inhibit lipoprotein lipase activity through distinct mechanisms.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 1419-1424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, we found that N-terminal ANGPTL3 (Fig. 1A) copurified with a significant nucleic acid contamination, as observed by absorbance at 254 nm (Fig. 1B). The contaminating nucleic acid was sensitive to DNase treatment, but resistant to RNase treatment, indicating that ANGPTL3 was bound to DNA (Fig. 1C). We also observed two peaks in the included volume of the SEC that contained ANGPTL3 (Fig. 1B). We pooled and concentrated the ANGPTL3 from each peak separately and assessed in vitro LPL inhibition using human VLDL as a substrate. These experiments showed that ANGPTL3 peak 1 had a significantly lower LPL inhibition activity than peak 2 (Fig. 1D). In order to remove the contaminating DNA from the ANGPTL3 preparation, we added an additional purification step, MonoQ anion-exchange chromatography, which led to a significant reduction in DNA and cleaner ANGPTL3 as observed from the 254 nm trace from the subsequent SEC (Fig. 1E). Of interest, DNA-free ANGPTL3 still eluted in two distinct peaks from the SEC after this additional anion-exchange step. Both peak 1 and peak 2 contained >95% pure ANGPTL3 (Fig. 1F). Next, ANGPTL3 from peaks 1 and 2 were tested for inhibition of LPL acting on VLDL. These assays showed that protein from both peaks were now equally as effective at inhibiting LPL (Fig. 1G). Thus, removal of DNA from ANGPTL3 increased its potency as an LPL inhibitor. We next set out to determine the oligomeric state of N-terminal ANGPTL3 in peaks 1 and 2. Although a previous study showed that ANGPTL3 elutes from SEC across a broad peak as high-molecular-weight oligomers, the precise composition of these oligomers was not determined (32Ge H. Cha J.Y. Gopal H. Harp C. Yu X. Repa J.J. Li C. Differential regulation and properties of angiopoietin-like proteins 3 and 4.J. Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 1484-1490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Thus, both peaks 1 and 2 were collected, concentrated, and separately analyzed by SEC-MALS. These experiments revealed that peak 1 had a molecular weight of 151 kDa, which corresponds to a hexamer of ANGPTL3 (monomer 26.8 kDa) (Fig. 2A). The second peak had a molecular weight of 76 kDa, which corresponds to an ANGPTL3 trimer (Fig. 2B). It is intriguing that we also found that the ANGPTL3 hexamers and trimers do not interconvert. When we reinjected each separately concentrated peak onto SEC, we observed only a single peak on the second SEC run (Fig. 2, A and B), indicating that ANGPLT3 hexamers do not break down into trimers and trimers do not assemble into hexamers. It should also be noted that N-terminal ANGPTL3 does not have any cysteine residues, which indicates disulfides cannot account for the oligomerization. To further investigate the oligomeric state, we subjected ANGPTL3 to a denaturing purification and then refolded the protein and compared the elution from SEC with that of natively purified ANGPTL3. This revealed that following refolding ANGPTL3 forms trimers (Fig. S1). In order to ascertain the oligomeric state of ANGPTL3 in mammalian cells, we compared N-terminal ANGPTL3 produced in HEK-293 cells with E. coli-produced ANGPTL3 (Fig. S2). The HEK-293-produced ANGPTL3 elutes from SEC as a trimer. It eluted slightly before the E. coli ANGPTL3 trimer from SEC, which was expected owing to the addition of N-linked glycans in mammalian cells. We also performed SEC-MALS on N-terminal ANGPTL4 and found ANGPTL4 elutes in a single peak with a molecular weight of 46 kDa, which corresponds to a trimer of ANGPTL4 (monomer 15.4 kDa, Fig. 2C). To further analyze the structural differences between ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4, we carried out SEC-SAXS. ANGPTL3 hexamers and trimers were purified by SEC and then separately concentrated before being reinjected for SEC-SAXS (Fig. S3). Analysis of ANGPTL3 hexamers and trimers revealed elongated structural envelopes, with the trimer being about half the length of the hexamer (Fig. 3, A and B, Table S1). The length of molecules seen here is consistent with other coiled-coil proteins of similar size. ANGPTL4 was also found to have an elongated and highly flexible str"

The study aimed to prove that serum PCT, combining with other relevant variables, has an even better sepsis-detecting ability in critically ill patients. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study in a regional teaching hospital enrolling eligible patients admitted to intensive care units (ICU) between July 1, 2016, and December 31, 2016, and followed them until March 31, 2017. The primary outcome measurement was the occurrence of sepsis. We used multivariate logistic regression analysis to determine the independent factors for sepsis and constructed a novel PCT-based score containing these factors. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) was applied to evaluate sepsis-detecting abilities. Finally, we validated the score using a validation cohort. Results A total of 258 critically ill patients (70.9±16.3 years; 55.4% man) were enrolled in the derivation cohort and further subgrouped into the sepsis group (n = 115) and the non-sepsis group (n = 143). By using the multivariate logistic regression analysis, we disclosed five independent factors for detecting sepsis, namely, “serum PCT level,” “albumin level” and “neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio” at ICU admission, along with “diabetes mellitus,” and “with vasopressor.” We subsequently constructed a PCT-based score containing the five weighted factors. The PCT-based score performed well in detecting sepsis with the cut-points of 8 points (AUROC 0.80; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74–0.85; sensitivity 0.70; specificity 0.76), which was better than PCT alone, C-reactive protein and infection probability score. The findings were confirmed using an independent validation cohort (n = 72, 69.2±16.7 years, 62.5% men) (cut-point: 8 points; AUROC, 0.79; 95% CI 0.69–0.90; sensitivity 0.64; specificity 0.87). Conclusions We proposed a novel PCT-based score that performs better in detecting sepsis than serum PCT levels alone, C-reactive protein, and infection probability score."

Latent trajectory modelling estimated variation in patterns of suicide attempt lethality in 1,719 individuals attended by ambulance services on at least three occasions between 2012 and 2016. Cox regression modelling investigated hazards of suicide attempt repetition, all–cause, and suicide mortality as a function of these patterns. Two distinct trajectories provided optimal fit (BIC: –39,464.92). The first (Low/Moderate to Low/Moderate Lethality group; 92.5%) consisted of those consistently using methods associated with low to moderate potential lethality throughout the observation period. The second (High to Low/Moderate Lethality group; 7.5%) consisted of those who initially used methods with higher potential lethality but who switched to methods characterised by lower lethality. There were no significant differences between groups in the hazards of reattempting suicide (Hazard Ratio [HR] = 1.41, 95% CI 0.76 to 2.59) or all–cause mortality (HR = 1.21, 95% CI 0.63 to 2.32). However, those assigned to the High to Low/Moderate Lethality trajectory group may be at greater risk of suicide (Sub–Hazard Ratio [SHR] = 2.82, 95% CI 1.16 to 6.86).

Underrepresentation of persons of color is particularly problematic when the health problem under study disproportionately affects minoritized communities. The purpose of this study was to test the validity and reliability of an abbreviated and adapted version of the Group Based Medical Mistrust Scale. The GBMMS is a 12-item scale with three subscales that assess suspicion, experiences of discrimination, and lack of support in the health care setting. To adapt for use in the research setting, we shortened the scale to six items, and replaced “health care workers” and “health care” with “medical researchers” and “medical research,” respectively. Using panelists from a market research firm, we recruited and enrolled a racially and ethnically diverse sample of American adults (N = 365) and adolescents aged 14–17 (N = 250). We administered the adapted scale in a web-based survey. We used Cronbach’s alpha to evaluate measure internal reliability of the scale and external factor analysis to evaluate the relationships between the revised scale items. Five of the six items loaded onto a single factor, with (α = 0.917) for adolescents and (α = 0.912) for adults. Mean scores for each item ranged from 2.5–2.9, and the mean summary score (range 6–25) was 13.3 for adults and 13.1 for adolescents. Among adults, Black respondents had significantly higher mean summary scores compared to whites and those in other racia/ethnic groups (p&lt;0.001). There was a trend toward significance for Black adolescents as compared to white respondents and those in other racial/ethnic groups (p = 0.09). This five-item modified version of the GBMMS is reliable and valid for measuring research mistrust with American adults and adolescents of diverse racial and ethnic identities."
https://openalex.org/W3126088338,"Background Female genital cutting (FGC) involve an acute physical trauma that hold a potential risk for immediate and long-term complications and mental health problems. The aim of this study was to examine the prediction of depressive symptoms and psychological distress by the immediate and current physical complications following FGC. Further, to examine whether the age at which 12-year-old Gambian girls had undergone the procedure affected mental health outcomes. Method This cross-sectional study recruited 134 12-year-old girls from 23 public primary schools in The Gambia. We used a structured clinical interview to assess mental health and life satisfaction, including the Short Mood and Feeling Questionnaire (SMFQ), the Symptom check list (SCL-5) and Cantril’s Ladder of Life Satisfaction. Each interview included questions about the cutting procedure, immediate- and current physical complications and the kind of help and care girls received following FGC. Results Depressive symptoms were associated with immediate physical health complications in a multivariate regression model [RR = 1.08 (1.03, 1.12), p = .001], and with present urogenital problems [RR = 1.19 (1.09, 1.31), p &lt; .001]. The girls that received medical help following immediate complications had a lower risk for depressive symptoms [RR = .73 (.55, .98), p = .04]. Psychological distress was only associated with immediate complications [RR = 1.04 (1.01, 1.07), p = .004]. No significant differences in mental health outcomes were found between girls who underwent FGC before the age of four in comparison to girls who underwent FGC after the age of four. Conclusion Our findings indicate that the immediate and long-term complications following FGC have implications for psychological health. Only a minimal number of girls received medical care when needed, and the dissemination of health education seems crucial in order to prevent adverse long-term physical and psychological health consequences."
https://openalex.org/W3121555270,"Humans adjust their behavioral strategies to maximize rewards. However, in the laboratory, human decisional biases exist and persist in two alternative tasks, even when this behavior leads to a loss in utilities. Such biases constitute the tendency to choose one action over others and emerge from a combination of external and internal factors that are specific for each individual. Here, we explored the idea that internally-mediated decisional biases should stably occur and, hence, be reflected across multiple behavioral tasks. Our experimental results confirm this notion and illustrate how participants exhibited similar choice biases across days and tasks. Moreover, we show how side-choice behavior in a two alternative choice task served to identify participants, suggesting that individual traits could underlie these choice biases. The tasks and analytic tools developed for this study should become instrumental in exploring the interaction between internal and external factors that contribute to decisional biases. They could also serve to detect psychopathologies that involve aberrant levels of choice variability."

Many of these disorders are autosomal recessive, resulting from founder mutations; hence they are amenable to prevention. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the pathogenicity of novel variants of IEI found among Emiratis. Methods This retrospective data collection study reports novel variants of IEI detected by diagnostic exome sequencing. Pathogenicity prediction was based on scoring tools, amino acid alignment, and Jensen–Shannon divergence values. Results Twenty-one novel variants were identified; nine were frameshift, three nonsense, four intronic (one pathogenic), and five missense (two pathogenic). Fifteen variants were likely pathogenic, of which 13 were autosomal recessive and two uncertain inheritance. Their clinical spectra included combined immunodeficiency, antibody deficiency, immune dysregulation, defects in intrinsic/innate immunity, and bone marrow failure. Conclusion The described novel pathogenic variants are core to a planned national screening program that aims toward IEI prevention. Future studies, however, are needed to confirm their natural history in individual patients and estimate their prevalence in the community."
https://openalex.org/W3123221902,"Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) serotype O, topotype CATHAY is a known porcinophilic virus that has caused devastating damage to the pig industry. However, the minimum infectious dose via a natural infection route in pigs, the infection dynamics in cattle, and risk of viral transmission from infected cattle to pigs have not been quantitatively analyzed. The FMDV strain O/HKN/1/2015 was serially diluted and inoculated into pigs via an intraoral route to determine the infectious dose. We found that a 10 4.0 tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 ) of the virus was insufficient, but 10 5.5 TCID 50 was sufficient to infect pigs via the oral route. While cows inoculated with the strain showed increased temperature in their feet, typical clinical signs including vesicular development were not observed. The cows showed short-term and low levels of viremia and virus excretion only before the detection of virus neutralizing antibodies. FMDV genes were not detected in esophageal-pharyngeal fluid from cows after 14 days post inoculation. No genetic insertions that could be associated with host adaptation were observed in viruses isolated from infected cows. These findings indicate that cows infected with FMDV of O/CATHAY have a low risk of viral transmission or persistence. Information on the dynamics of virus infection is essential for ensuring the rapid and accurate diagnosis of this disease, and its surveillance."
https://openalex.org/W3123403219,"Background Both malaria and intestinal parasites are endemic in Cameroon, and their co-infection can be of great impact on anaemia among people living with HIV (PLWH). This community-based retrospective cohort study determined the prevalence and association of infections with anaemia in PLWH and HIV-negative individuals in Buea, Cameroon from March to August 2019. Methods The study population comprised of 190 PLWH and 216 consenting HIV-negative individuals from the Buea community. Participants were examined clinically, the collected blood sample was used for malaria parasite (MP) detection, HIV diagnosis and haemoglobin (Hb) measurement while stool samples were examined for the detection of intestinal parasites (IPs). Proportions were compared using Pearson’s Chi-square test and association of anaemia with independent variables was evaluated using logistic regression analysis. Results Out of the 406 participants, MP, IPs and MP/IP co-infection prevalences were 15.5%, 13.0% and 3.0% respectively. PLWH had a higher prevalence of MP (16.3%, P = 0.17), IPs (23.7%, P ˂ 0.001) and MP/IPs co-infection (3.7%, P = 0.04) when compared with HIV-negative participants. Similarly, PLWH had significantly lower mean haemoglobin value (11.10 ± 1.54 g/dL) than their HIV-negative counterparts (12.45 ± 2.06 g/dL). Also, PLWH co-infected with MP and IPs were observed to have a significantly lower mean haemoglobin value (10.6 ± 1.21 g/dL). PLWH had a significantly (P ˂ 0.001) higher prevalence of mild (56.8%), moderate (18.4%) and severe (1.6%) anaemia when compared with HIV-negative counterparts. The significant risk factors associated with anaemia included being febrile (P = 0.03), MP-infected only (P = 0.001), HIV-infected only (P &lt; 0.001), having dual (P &lt; 0.001) or triple-infections (P = 0.03). Conclusion Malaria and intestinal parasites remain public health concerns among PLWH and anaemia as a serious haematological abnormality gets exacerbated even with the viral load suppression. Hence, routine medical check-ups among PLWH are recommended."
https://openalex.org/W3123899080,"The cellular prion protein (PrP) is essential to the long-term maintenance of myelin sheaths in peripheral nerves. PrP activates the adhesion G-protein coupled receptor Adgrg6 on Schwann cells and initiates a pro-myelination cascade of molecular signals. Because Adgrg6 is crucial for peripheral myelin development and regeneration after nerve injury, we investigated the role of PrP in peripheral nerve repair. We performed experimental sciatic nerve crush injuries in co-isogenic wild-type and PrP-deficient mice, and examined peripheral nerve repair processes. Generation of repair Schwann cells, macrophage recruitment and remyelination were similar in PrP-deficient and wild-type mice. We conclude that PrP is dispensable for sciatic nerve de- and remyelination after crush injury. Adgrg6 may sustain its function in peripheral nerve repair independently of its activation by PrP."
https://openalex.org/W3124561465,"The HAD superfamily is named after the halogenated acid dehalogenase found in bacteria, which hydrolyses a diverse range of organic phosphate substrates. Although certain studies have shown the involvement of HAD genes in Pi starvation responses, systematic classification and bioinformatics analysis of the HAD superfamily in plants is lacking. In this study, 41 and 40 HAD genes were identified by genomic searching in rice and Arabidopsis , respectively. According to sequence similarity, these proteins are divided into three major groups and seven subgroups. Conserved motif analysis indicates that the majority of the identified HAD proteins contain phosphatase domains. A further structural analysis showed that HAD proteins have four conserved motifs and specified cap domains. Fewer HAD genes show collinearity relationships in both rice and Arabidopsis , which is consistent with the large variations in the HAD genes. Among the 41 HAD genes of rice, the promoters of 28 genes contain Pi-responsive cis-elements. Mining of transcriptome data and qRT-PCR results showed that at least the expression of 17 HAD genes was induced by Pi starvation in shoots or roots. These HAD proteins are predicted to be involved in intracellular or extracellular Po recycling under Pi stress conditions in plants."
https://openalex.org/W3124925790,"The non-breeding period of pelagic seabirds, and particularly the moulting stage, is an important, but understudied part of their annual cycle as they are hardly accessible outside of the breeding period. Knowledge about the moulting ecology of seabirds is important to understand the challenges they face outside and within the breeding season. Here, we combined stable carbon ( δ 13 C) and oxygen ( δ 18 O) signatures of rectrices grown during the non-breeding period of two pairs of storm-petrel species breeding in the northern (European storm-petrel, Hydrobates pelagicus , ESP; Leach’s storm-petrel, Hydrobates leucorhous , LSP) and southern (black-bellied storm-petrel, Fregetta tropica , BBSP; Wilson’s storm-petrel, Oceanites oceanicus , WSP) hemispheres to determine differences in moulting ranges within and between species. To understand clustering patterns in δ 13 C and δ 18 O moulting signatures, we examined various variables: species, sexes, years, morphologies (feather growth rate, body mass, tarsus length, wing length) and δ 15 N. We found that different factors could explain the differences within and between the four species. We additionally employed a geographical distribution prediction model based on oceanic δ 13 C and δ 18 O isoscapes, combined with chlorophyll- a concentrations and observational data to predict potential moulting areas of the sampled feather type. The northern species were predicted to moult in temperate and tropical Atlantic zones. BBSP was predicted to moult on the southern hemisphere north of the Southern Ocean, while WSP was predicted to moult further North, including in the Arctic and northern Pacific. While moulting distribution can only be estimated on large geographical scales using δ 13 C and δ 18 O, validating predictive outcomes with food availability proxies and observational data may provide valuable insights into important moulting grounds. Establishing those, in turn, is important for conservation management of elusive pelagic seabirds."
https://openalex.org/W3125403292,"Background Socio-economic growth in many low and middle-income countries has resulted in more available, though not equitably accessible, healthcare. Such growth has also increased demands from citizens for their health systems to be more responsive to their needs. This paper shares a protocol for the RESPONSE study which aims to understand, co-produce, implement and evaluate context-sensitive interventions to improve health systems responsiveness to health needs of vulnerable groups in Ghana and Vietnam. Methods We will use a realist mixed-methods theory-driven case study design, combining quantitative (household survey, secondary analysis of facility data) and qualitative (in-depth interviews, focus groups, observations and document and literature review) methods. Data will be analysed retroductively. The study will comprise three Phases. In Phase 1, we will understand actors’ expectations of responsive health systems, identify key priorities for interventions, and using evidence from a realist synthesis we will develop an initial theory and generate a baseline data. In Phase 2, we will co-produce jointly with key actors, the context-sensitive interventions to improve health systems responsiveness. The interventions will seek to improve internal (i.e. intra-system) and external (i.e. people-systems) interactions through participatory workshops. In Phase 3, we will implement and evaluate the interventions by testing and refining our initial theory through comparing the intended design to the interventions’ actual performance. Discussion The study’s key outcomes will be: (1) improved health systems responsiveness, contributing to improved health services and ultimately health outcomes in Ghana and Vietnam and (2) an empirically-grounded and theoretically-informed model of complex contexts-mechanisms-outcomes relations, together with transferable best practices for scalability and generalisability. Decision-makers across different levels will be engaged throughout. Capacity strengthening will be underpinned by in-depth understanding of capacity needs and assets of each partner team, and will aim to strengthen individual, organisational and system level capacities."
https://openalex.org/W3125887088,"As highlighted in the International Year of the Nurse and the Midwife, access to quality nursing and midwifery care is essential to promote maternal-newborn health and improve survival. One intervention aimed at improving maternal-newborn health and reducing underutilization of pregnancy services is the construction of maternity waiting homes (MWHs). The purpose of this study was to assess whether there was a significant change in antenatal care (ANC) and postnatal care (PNC) attendance, family planning use, and vaccination rates before and after implementation of the Core MWH Model in rural Zambia. A quasi-experimental controlled before-and-after design was used to evaluate the impact of the Core MWH Model by assessing associations between ANC and PNC attendance, family planning use, and vaccination rates for mothers who gave birth to a child in the past 13 months. Twenty health care facilities received the Core MWH Model and 20 were identified as comparison facilities. Before-and-after community surveys were carried out. Multivariable logistic regression were used to assess the association between Core MWH Model use and ANC and PNC attendance. The total sample includes 4711 mothers. Mothers who used the Core MWH Model had better ANC and PNC attendance, family planning use, and vaccination rates than mothers who did not use a MWH. All mothers appeared to fare better across these outcomes at endline. We found an association between Core MWH Model use and better ANC and PNC attendance, family planning use, and newborn vaccination outcomes. Maternity waiting homes may serve as a catalyst to improve use of facility services for vulnerable mothers."
https://openalex.org/W3121566679,"We investigate the power densities which are obtainable locally in a vibration bioreactor. These reactor systems are of great relevance for research about oncological or antibacterial therapies. Our focus lies on the local liquid pressure caused by resonance vibration in the fluid contained by the reactor’s petri dish. We use for the excitation one piezoelectric patch which offer advantages concerning controllability and reproducibility, when compared to ultrasound. The experimental work is extended by finite element analyses of bioreactor details. The peaks of the vibration response for water, sodium chloride (0.1N Standard solution), and McCoy’s 5A culture medium are in good alignment. Several natural frequencies can be observed. Local power density can reach multiple times the magnitude used in ultrasound studies. Based on the observed local power densities, we are planning future work for the exposure of cell cultures to mechanical vibration."
https://openalex.org/W3124943683,"Daptomycin (DAP) is one of the most potent antibiotics used for the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections. Due to an increase in its administration for combating MRSA infections, DAP non-susceptible (DAP-NS) MRSA strains have recently been reported in clinical settings. The presence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the multiple peptide resistance factor ( mprF ) gene is the most frequently reported cause for the evolution of DAP-NS MRSA strains; however, there are some variations of SNPs that could lead to DAP-NS. In this study, we used two clinical MRSA strains, including DAP susceptible (DAP-S) and DAP-NS, isolated from the same patient at different time points. We introduced T345I SNP to mprF of the DAP-S MRSA strain using the gene exchange method with pIMAY vector. Further, we investigated the phenotype of the mutant strain, including drug susceptibility, cell surface positive charge, and growth speed. The mutant strain exhibited (i) resistance to DAP, (ii) up-regulation of positive surface charge, (iii) slower growth speed, and (iv) thickened cell walls. Hence, the SNP in mprF may have caused an up-regulation in MprF function, with a subsequent increase in positive surface charge. Cumulatively, these results demonstrated that the T345I amino acid substitution in mprF represents one of the primary causes of DAP-NS in MRSA strains."
https://openalex.org/W3122705121,"Background Efficient learning is essential for successful completion of the medical degree and students use a variety of strategies to cope with university requirements. However, strategies that lead to academic success have hardly been explored. We therefore evaluated the individual learning approaches used by a cohort of medical students in their first and second preclinical years and analyzed possible correlations with examination scores. Methods 107 students participated in our longitudinal survey on cognitive, meta-cognitive and resource-oriented learning strategies using the LIST-questionnaire (Lernstrategien im Studium). The students were surveyed twice while in their first and second year of medical school, respectively and academic performances were assessed as scores obtained in two examinations written shortly after the LIST surveys. Statistical evaluations included comparisons and cluster analyses. Results We here identified four different patterns of learning strategy combinations, describing the relaxed, diligent, hard-working, and sociable learners. About half of the students stayed true to their initially registered pattern of learning strategy combinations while 53 students underwent a change between the first and second surveys. Changes were predominantly made between the relaxed and the sociable and between the diligent and the hard-working learners, respectively. Examination results suggested that the diligent and hard-working learners were academically more successful than the relaxed and sociable ones. Conclusion Early habits of sociable learning were quickly abandoned however, not in favor of more successful patterns. It is therefore essential to develop interventions on learning skills that have a lasting impact on the pattern of the students´ learning strategy combinations."
https://openalex.org/W3123653565,"Optimised pre-clinical models are required for TB drug development to better predict the pharmacokinetics of anti-tuberculosis (anti-TB) drugs to shorten the time taken for novel drugs and combinations to be approved for clinical trial. Microdialysis can be used to measure unbound drug concentrations in awake freely moving animals in order to describe the pharmacokinetics of drugs in the organs as a continuous sampling technique. The aim of this work was to develop and optimise the microdialysis methodology in guinea pigs to better understand the pharmacokinetics of rifampicin in the lung. In vitro experiments were performed before progressing into in vivo studies because the recovery (concentration of the drug in the tissue fluid related to that in the collected dialysate) of rifampicin was dependent on a variety of experimental conditions. Mass spectrometry of the dialysate was used to determine the impact of flow rate, perfusion fluid and the molecular weight cut-off and membrane length of probes on the recovery of rifampicin at physiologically relevant concentrations. Following determination of probe efficiency and identification of a correlation between rifampicin concentrations in the lung and skeletal muscle, experiments were conducted to measure rifampicin in the sacrospinalis of guinea pigs using microdialysis. Lung concentrations of rifampicin were estimated from the rifampicin concentrations measured in the sacrospinalis. These studies suggest the potential usefulness of the microdialysis methodology to determine drug concentrations of selected anti-TB drugs to support new TB drug development."
https://openalex.org/W3123831279,"Background To evaluate gestational age as a predictor of subsequent preterm birth. Materials and methods This was a retrospective birth cohort study to evaluate gestational age as a predictor of subsequent preterm birth. Participants were mothers who gave birth to their first two children in Western Australia, 1980–2015 (N = 255,151 mothers). For each week of final gestational age of the first birth, we calculated relative risks (RR) and absolute risks (AR) of subsequent preterm birth defined as final gestational age before 28, 32, 34 and &lt;37 weeks. Risks were unadjusted to preserve risk factor profiles at each week of gestation. Results The relative risks of second birth before 28, 32, and 34 weeks’ gestation were all approximately twenty times higher for mothers whose first birth had a gestational age of 22 to 30 weeks compared to those whose first birth was at 40 weeks’ gestation. The absolute risks of second birth before 28, 32, and 34 weeks’ gestation for these mothers had upper confidence limits that were all less than 16.74%. The absolute risk of second birth before 37 weeks was highest at 32.11% (95% CI: 30.27, 34.02) for mothers whose first birth was 22 to 30 weeks’ gestation. For all gestational ages of the first child, the lowest quartile and median gestational age of the second birth were at least 36 weeks and at least 38 weeks, respectively. Sensitivity and positive predictive values were all below 35%. Conclusion Relative risks of early subsequent birth increased markedly with decreasing gestational age of the first birth. However, absolute risks of clinically significant preterm birth (&lt;28 weeks, &lt;32 weeks, &lt;34 weeks), sensitivity and positive predictive values remained low. Early gestational age is a strong risk factor but a poor predictor of subsequent preterm birth."
https://openalex.org/W3122608554,"Objective To determine risk factors affecting time-to-death ≤90 and &gt;90 days in children who underwent a modified Blalock-Taussig shunt (MBTS). Methods Data from a retrospective cohort study were obtained from children aged 0–3 years who experienced MBTS between 2005 and 2016. Time-to-death (prior to Glenn/repair), time-to-alive up until December 2017 without repair, and time-to-progression to Glenn/repair following MBTS were presented using competing risks survival analysis. Demographic, surgical and anesthesia-related factors were recorded. Time-to-death ≤90 days and &gt;90 days was analyzed using multivariate time-dependent Cox regression models to identify independent predictors and presented by adjusted hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results Of 380 children, 119 died, 122 survived and 139 progressed to Glenn/repair. Time-to-death probability (95% CI) within 90 days was 0.18 (0.14–0.22). Predictors of time-to-death ≤90 days (n = 63) were low weight (&lt;3 kg) (HR 7.6, 95% CI:2.8–20.4), preoperative ventilator support (HR 2.7, 95% CI:1.3–5.6), postoperative shunt thrombosis (HR 5.0, 95% CI:2.4–10.4), bleeding (HR 4.5, 95% CI:2.1–9.4) and renal failure (HR 4.1, 95% CI:1.5–10.9). Predictors of time-to-death &gt;90 days (n = 56) were children diagnosed with pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect and single ventricle (compared to tetralogy of fallot) (HR 3.2, 95% CI:1.2–7.7 and HR 3.1, 95% CI:1.3–7.6, respectively), shunt size/weight ratio &gt;1.1 vs &lt;0.65 (HR 6.8, 95% CI:1.4–32.6) and longer duration of mechanical ventilator (HR 1.002, 95% CI:1.001–1.004). Shunt size/weight ratio ≥1.0 (vs &lt;1.0) and ≥0.65 (vs &lt;0.65) were predictors for overall time-to-death in neonates and toddlers, respectively (HR 13.1, 95% CI:2.8–61.4 and HR 7.8, 95% CI:1.7–34.8, respectively). Conclusions Perioperative factors were associated with time-to-death ≤90 days, whereas particular cardiac defect, larger shunt size/weight ratio, and longer mechanical ventilation were associated with time-to-death &gt;90 days after receiving MBTS. Larger shunt size/weight ratio should be reevaluated within 90 days to minimize the risk of shunt over flow."
https://openalex.org/W3123132151,"Background Short message service (SMS) based interventions are widely used in healthcare and have shown promising results to improve cancer screening programs. However, more research is still needed to implement SMS in the screening process. We present a study protocol to assess the impact on health and economics of three targeted SMS-based interventions in population-based cancer screening programs. Methods/Design The M-TICs study is a randomized controlled trial with a formal process evaluation. Participants aged 50–69 years identified as eligible from the colorectal cancer (CRC) and breast cancer (BC) screening program of the Catalan Institute of Oncology (Catalonia, Spain) will be randomly assigned to receive standard invitation procedure (control group) or SMS-based intervention to promote participation. Two interventions will be conducted in the CRC screening program: 1) Screening invitation reminder: Those who do not participate in the CRC screening within 6 weeks of invite will receive a reminder (SMS or letter); 2) Reminder to complete and return fecal immunochemical test (FIT) kit: SMS reminder versus no intervention to individuals who have picked up a FIT kit at the pharmacy and they have not returned it after 14 days. The third intervention will be performed in the BC screening program. Women who had been screened previously will receive an SMS invitation or a letter invitation to participate in the screening. As a primary objective we will assess the impact on participation for each intervention. The secondary objectives will be to analyze the cost-effectiveness of the interventions and to assess participants’ perceptions. Expected results The results from this randomized controlled trial will provide important empirical evidence for the use of mobile phone technology as a tool for improving population-based cancer screening programs. These results may influence the cancer screening invitation procedure in future routine practice. Trial registration Registry: NCT04343950 (04/09/2020); clinicaltrials.gov."
https://openalex.org/W3125927972,"Background Some patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) must be hospitalized because of heart failure (HF), including HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and HF with reduced EF (HFrEF). The association between IPF and HF has not been clarified. We retrospectively investigated the clinical features and outcomes of patients with IPF who required nonelective hospitalization because of HF. Methods We examined data from IPF patients who required nonelective hospitalization for HF at the Kindai University Hospital from January 2008 to December 2018. We divided the patients into 3 groups: those with HFpEF without elevated right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP), those with HFpEF and elevated RVSP, and those with HFrEF. The recurrence rates of HF after discharge and the 30- and 90-day mortality rates of the patients were evaluated. Results During the study period, 37 patients with IPF required hospitalization because of HF. Among the 34 patients included in the study, 17 (50.0%) were diagnosed with HFpEF without elevated RVSP, 11 (32.3%) with HFpEF and elevated RVSP, and 6 (17.6%) with HFrEF. Patients with HFrEF had significantly higher values for B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and left ventricular (LV) end-systolic and end-diastolic diameters than patients with the 2 types of HFpEF (BNP: P = 0.01 and P = 0.0004, LV end-systolic diameter: P &lt;0.0001 and P &lt;0.0001, and LV end-diastolic diameter: P = 0.01 and P = 0.0004, respectively). Notably, the difference between the LVEFs of the patients with 2 types of HFpEF was not significant. The patients with HFpEF without elevated RVSP had the lowest 30- and 90-day mortality rates (0%, P = 0.02 and 11.7%, P = 0.11, respectively). Conclusions Among patients with IPF, HFpEF without elevated RVSP was the most common type of HF that required hospitalization. Patients with HFpEF without elevated RVSP survived longer than the patients with the other 2 types of HF."
https://openalex.org/W3121691685,"Background The IgE-mediated activation of mast cells and basophils results in the secretion of many substances, including the release of FceRI-alpha subunit. This released alpha subunit can bind IgE and it may act as a down-regulator of subsequent IgE-dependent reactions. However, previous studies do not observe loss of the mass of FceRI-alpha associated with the cells, at least not for human basophils. This study was designed to understand the basis for the discordant observations. Methods Purified human basophils were stimulated with multiple activating secretagogues and supernatants were examined for histamine and released FceRI-alpha. In addition, cell surface IgE densities (occupied and unoccupied) were measured by flow cytometry and total cellular content of mature and immature FceRI-alpha determined with Western blots. Results Released FceRI-alpha, on average, represented 7% of the total surface FceRI before the reaction. The molecular weight of the soluble FceRI-alpha was approximately 54 kD, larger than immature subunit and somewhat smaller than surface subunit. In addition, 1) release ceased long before internalized FceRI-alpha was processed, 2) release was insensitive to Bafilomycin A, 3) release was independent of the starting density of FceRI and 4) release occurred more effectively with non-IgE-dependent stimuli, FMLP or C5a. Conclusions There appears to be relatively constant amount of nearly mature FceRI-alpha that is susceptible to secretion events induced by any form of stimulation. The amount, on average, represents about 7% of the mature form of FceRI-alpha."
https://openalex.org/W3121862238,"Evocalcet is a novel calcimimetic agent with fewer gastrointestinal (GI) adverse effects compared to cinacalcet. Although it is thought that cinacalcet induces GI side effects through the direct stimulation of the calcium receptor (CaR) expressed in the GI tract, the differences in the direct stimulatory effects of these two drugs on the GI tract have not been reported. In this study, we analyzed the difference in the GI effects of these two calcimimetic agents using miniature pigs by detecting vagus nerve stimulation after oral administration of the agents. Although cinacalcet induced vomiting in miniature pigs, evocalcet never induced emetic symptoms. A significant increase in the vagus nerve action potentials was observed after the administration of cinacalcet. Although the increase of that after the administration of evocalcet was mild and not significant in comparison to that in the vehicle group, it was not significantly different from the vagus nerve action potentials after cinacalcet treatment."
