https://openalex.org/W1852268638,"MicroRNA (miRNA) maturation is initiated by Microprocessor composed of RNase III DROSHA and its cofactor DGCR8, whose fidelity is critical for generation of functional miRNAs. To understand how Microprocessor recognizes pri-miRNAs, we here reconstitute human Microprocessor with purified recombinant proteins. We find that Microprocessor is an ∼364 kDa heterotrimeric complex of one DROSHA and two DGCR8 molecules. Together with a 23-amino acid peptide from DGCR8, DROSHA constitutes a minimal functional core. DROSHA serves as a ""ruler"" by measuring 11 bp from the basal ssRNA-dsRNA junction. DGCR8 interacts with the stem and apical elements through its dsRNA-binding domains and RNA-binding heme domain, respectively, allowing efficient and accurate processing. DROSHA and DGCR8, respectively, recognize the basal UG and apical UGU motifs, which ensure proper orientation of the complex. These findings clarify controversies over the action mechanism of DROSHA and allow us to build a general model for pri-miRNA processing."

The function of this organization has been unclear, but the anatomical connections of striosomes indicate their relation to emotion-related brain regions, including the medial prefrontal cortex. We capitalized on this fact by combining pathway-specific optogenetics and electrophysiology in behaving rats to search for selective functions of striosomes. We demonstrate that a medial prefronto-striosomal circuit is selectively active in and causally necessary for cost-benefit decision-making under approach-avoidance conflict conditions known to evoke anxiety in humans. We show that this circuit has unique dynamic properties likely reflecting striatal interneuron function. These findings demonstrate that cognitive and emotion-related functions are, like sensory-motor processing, subject to encoding within compartmentally organized representations in the forebrain and suggest that striosome-targeting corticostriatal circuits can underlie neural processing of decisions fundamental for survival.

Across the animal kingdom, neural mechanisms have evolved to allow decision-making based on rewarding and aversive features of the environment (Glimcher and Fehr, 2014Glimcher P.W. Fehr E. Neuroeconomics: Decision Making and the Brain.Second Edition. Academic Press, New York2014Google Scholar). This fundamental capacity, critical to normal human life, is disabled in a range of neuropsychiatric and neurologic disorders (Gleichgerrcht et al., 2010Gleichgerrcht E. Ibáñez A. Roca M. Torralva T. Manes F. Decision-making cognition in neurodegenerative diseases.Nat. Rev. Neurol. 2010; 6: 611-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). As yet, the mechanisms underlying the relation between decision-making and emotion-related circuit function remain largely unknown (Aupperle and Paulus, 2010Aupperle R.L. Paulus M.P. Neural systems underlying approach and avoidance in anxiety disorders.Dialogues Clin. Neurosci. 2010; 12: 517-531PubMed Google Scholar). Pioneering work, however, has shown that behavioral reactions to value-based decision-making, based on the perceived potential costs and benefits of taking a given action, are differentially represented in regions of the medial prefrontal cortex (Rangel and Hare, 2010Rangel A.

These cortical regions are interlinked with each other and with other downstream parts of the limbic system (Salamone, 1994Salamone J.D.

They are also linked to the striatum, part of the basal ganglia (Amemori and Graybiel, 2012Amemori K. Graybiel A.M.

These networks have been identified in human brain imaging studies as regions of co-activation in relation to emotional task performance (Aupperle et al., 2015Aupperle R.L. Melrose A.J. Francisco A.

In rodents, potential homologs of these regions of the prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortex have been identified (Milad et al., 2007Milad M.R. Quirk G.J. Pitman R.K. Orr S.P. Fischl B. Rauch S.L.

The role of rat medial frontal cortex in effort-based decision making.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 10996-11003PubMed Google Scholar). Much anatomical work supports the view that such value-related networks include corticostriatal circuits (Donoghue and Herkenham, 1986Donoghue J.P. Herkenham M.

The neostriatal mosaic: compartmentalization of corticostriatal input and striatonigral output systems.Nature. 1984; 311: 461-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). A striking feature of a subset of these prefronto-striatal and orbitofronto-striatal circuits is that they preferentially target a distinctive set of distributed striatal microzones known as striosomes (Graybiel and Ragsdale, 1978Graybiel A.M. Ragsdale Jr., C.W. Histochemically distinct compartments in the striatum of human, monkeys, and cat demonstrated by acetylthiocholinesterase staining.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1978; 75: 5723-5726Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). These regions are distinguishable from the much larger matrix tissue of the striatum by their differential expression of most of the neurotransmitter-related molecules expressed in the striatum (Crittenden and Graybiel, 2011Crittenden J.R.

Overriding phasic dopamine signals redirects action selection during risk/reward decision making.Neuron. 2014; 84: 177-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). By contrast, the large matrix compartment of the striatum is divided into a mosaic of microzones known as matrisomes, and these are linked by their outputs to the classic sensorimotor zones of the basal ganglia (Flaherty and Graybiel, 1993Flaherty A.W. Graybiel A.M. Output architecture of the primate putamen.J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 3222-3237PubMed Google Scholar). The differential functions of striosomes, relative to matrix and its matrisomes, have never been identified, largely for technical reasons. Nor is it known how they and their corticostriatal pathways are recruited in different modes of decision-making related to mood and motivation, despite the fact that it has been known for years that cortical regions targeting striosomes are parts of value-related networks (Rudebeck et al., 2006Rudebeck P.H. Walton M.E. Smyth A.N. Bannerman D.M. Rushworth M.F. Separate neural pathways process different decision costs.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 1161-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, Rushworth et al., 2011Rushworth M.F. Noonan M.P. Boorman E.D. Walton M.E. Behrens T.E. Frontal cortex and reward-guided learning and decision-making.Neuron. 2011; 70: 1054-1069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). The lack of this information presents a major roadblock to the development of neural circuit-based therapies for disorders impacting decisions based on value. We therefore designed a battery of decision-making tests involving varying combinations of cost and benefit, and then, in rats performing the different tasks, applied an optogenetic approach in order to assess the differential contributions to decision-making of striosome-targeting and matrix-targeting prefrontal corticostriatal pathways. We based our strategy on the finding (Amemori and Graybiel, 2012Amemori K. Graybiel A.M. Localized microstimulation of primate pregenual cingulate cortex induces negative decision-making.Nat. Neurosci. 2012; 15: 776-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) that, in monkeys, decisions based on conflicting combinations of cost and benefit in approach-avoidance tasks selectively activate a subset of neurons in a medial prefrontal region that could correspond to a zone targeting the striosome compartment of the striatum, as indicated by earlier anatomical work (Eblen and Graybiel, 1995Eblen F. Graybiel A.M. Highly restricted origin of prefrontal cortical inputs to striosomes in the macaque monkey.J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 5999-6013PubMed Google Scholar). These results in the non-human primate suggested that in-depth analysis of striosome-targeting and matrix-targeting circuits with multiple methods feasible in rodent experiments might uncover causally important decision-making control systems hidden from previous analyses. To do these experiments, we focused on two corticostriatal projections from adjacent prefrontal cortical regions implicated in decision-making (Dwyer et al., 2010Dwyer D.M. Dunn M.J. Rhodes S.E.

Herkenham M.

The neostriatal mosaic: compartmentalization of corticostriatal input and striatonigral output systems.Nature. 1984; 311: 461-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). One, originating in the prefrontal region called prelimbic cortex in rodents (here called PFC-PL), projects preferentially to striosomes in the associative striatum (Donoghue and Herkenham, 1986Donoghue J.P. Herkenham M. Neostriatal projections from individual cortical fields conform to histochemically distinct striatal compartments in the rat.Brain Res. 1986; 365: 397-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, Gerfen, 1984Gerfen C.R. The neostriatal mosaic: compartmentalization of corticostriatal input and striatonigral output systems.Nature. 1984; 311: 461-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). The second, originating in the prefrontal region called in rodents anterior cingulate cortex (here named PFC-ACC), projects preferentially to the matrix compartment of the associative striatum (Donoghue and Herkenham, 1986Donoghue J.P. Herkenham M. Neostriatal projections from individual cortical fields conform to histochemically distinct striatal compartments in the rat.Brain Res. 1986; 365: 397-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). By optogenetically tagging these pathways, and then applying manipulations in combination with behavioral and electrophysiological assays, we tried to differentiate the functions of these pathways, identified both by their cortical origins in different medial prefrontal cortical regions and by their different preferential striatal termination fields in either striosome or matrix compartment. Our findings suggest that the medial prefrontal pathway targeting striosomes is differentially activated by motivational conflict induced by a pair of options evoking approach-avoidance conflict, and that this circuit, by way of an intrastriatal inhibitory network, can control both the activity of striosomes in such cost-benefit decision-making and the behavior itself. These findings place the cortico-striosomal system as a potentially crucial control mechanism for organisms facing the need to act based on conflicting options in their environment. We challenged rats to make decisions in five different contexts as they performed T-maze tasks in which they could turn right or left to reach one of the offers presented at the end-arm goals (Figures 1 and S1; Supplemental Experimental Procedures). The tasks presented the animals with different combinations of costs and benefits, with lights of different brightness as costs at the end-arm goal sites and chocolate milk of different dilutions as benefits at these sites (Figure 1A). The animals were over-trained (Figure 1B) and were given forced-choice reminder trials before the main experimental sessions (Figures 1C and 1D; Supplemental Experimental Procedures). To estimate the sensitivity of the rats to benefits without accompanying costs, we introduced two benefit-benefit tasks with the end-arms baited with rewards of similar or dissimilar value (Figure 1A). To examine sensitivity to costs, we introduced a cost-cost task, in which benefits were held constant but were paired with different costs (Figure 1A). Finally, to examine how the rats integrated cost and benefit, we introduced cost-benefit tasks (Figure 1A) that allowed us to assess how choice behaviors were affected by different levels of approach-avoidance conflict (Amemori and Graybiel, 2012Amemori K. Graybiel A.M. Localized microstimulation of primate pregenual cingulate cortex induces negative decision-making.Nat. Neurosci. 2012; 15: 776-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, Miller, 1971Miller N.E. Selected Papers on Conflict, Displacement, Learned Drives and Theory.

A simple and reliable conflict procedure for testing anti-anxiety agents.Psychopharmacology (Berl.). 1971; 21: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). In the cost-benefit conflict task, high benefits were combined with high costs. Thus the rats were required to receive substantial costs to gain reward, a situation inducing approach-avoidance conflict at each choice. In the non-conflict cost-benefit task, high benefits were paired with low costs, thus letting the rats receive reward without receiving substantial costs. In order to estimate the degree of approach-avoidance conflict for these two tasks, we applied logistic modeling and parameterized the cost-benefit ratio (CBR) (Supplemental Experimental Procedures), which indicated the degree of cost that the rats had to accept in order to receive a unit amount of reward. We used the CBR as an estimate of approach-avoidance conflict, because approach-avoidance conflict could be characterized as the conflict between motivation to avoid cost and motivation to approach benefit, and the CBR corresponds to the ratio of these two opponent motivations. This CBR analysis indicated that the conflict task induced high motivational conflict and that the non-conflict task did not (Figure 1E). Our experiments were thus directed toward the form of cost-benefit decision-making in which regulation of simultaneous approach or avoidance motivations was required.Figure S1Behavioral Tasks, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) An example of the change in choice behavior (mean ±SEM) in relation to chocolate milk concentration, obtained from a single rat.(B) The shift of choice function (mean ±SEM) across variable levels of motivational conflict, observed in a single rat performing cost-benefit conflict, benefit-benefit and non-conflict cost-benefit tasks.

We analyzed the contribution of the individual striosome-targeting and matrix-targeting pathways first by optogenetically inhibiting their corticostriatal terminal regions in rats with localized injections of adeno-associated virus (AAV5) carrying halorhodopsin (eNpHR3.0-EYFP) under the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIα (CaMKIIα) promoter, or control virus, in the PFC-PL or the PFC-ACC, and with optical fibers placed in the anterior dorsomedial striatum (Figures 2A, 2B , and S2; Supplemental Experimental Procedures). The cortical inputs to the striatum were differentially selective for striosomes in cases with virus-labeled PFC-PL fibers, in accordance with prior findings, and differentially selective for matrix in PFC-ACC cases. However, also in accordance with prior work, the non-preferred compartment always exhibited some labeling, varying case by case (Eblen and Graybiel, 1995Eblen F. Graybiel A.M.

https://openalex.org/W1890513212,"Vertebrate cells have evolved elaborate cell-autonomous defense programs to monitor subcellular compartments for infection and to evoke counter-responses. These programs are activated by pathogen-associated pattern molecules and by various strategies intracellular pathogens employ to alter cellular microenvironments. Here, we show that, when uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) infect bladder epithelial cells (BECs), they are targeted by autophagy but avoid degradation because of their capacity to neutralize lysosomal pH. This change is detected by mucolipin TRP channel 3 (TRPML3), a transient receptor potential cation channel localized to lysosomes. TRPML3 activation then spontaneously initiates lysosome exocytosis, resulting in expulsion of exosome-encased bacteria. These studies reveal a cellular default system for lysosome homeostasis that has been co-opted by the autonomous defense program to clear recalcitrant pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2127229383,"An enhanced capacity for de novo lipid synthesis is a metabolic feature of most cancer cells that distinguishes them from their cells of origin. However, the mechanisms through which oncogenes alter lipid metabolism are poorly understood. We find that expression of oncogenic PI3K (H1047R) or K-Ras (G12V) in breast epithelial cells is sufficient to induce de novo lipogenesis, and this occurs through the convergent activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) downstream of these common oncogenes. Oncogenic stimulation of mTORC1 signaling in this isogenic setting or a panel of eight breast cancer cell lines leads to activation of the sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBP1 and SREBP2) that are required for oncogene-induced lipid synthesis. The SREBPs are also required for the growth factor-independent growth and proliferation of oncogene-expressing cells. Finally, we find that elevated mTORC1 signaling is associated with increased mRNA and protein levels of canonical SREBP targets in primary human breast cancer samples. These data suggest that the mTORC1/SREBP pathway is a major mechanism through which common oncogenic signaling events induce de novo lipid synthesis to promote aberrant growth and proliferation of cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W1602041588,"Acquired therapeutic resistance is the major drawback to effective systemic therapies for cancers. Aggressive triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) develop resistance to chemotherapies rapidly, whereas the underlying mechanisms are not completely understood. Here we show that genotoxic treatments significantly increased the expression of miR-181a in TNBC cells, which enhanced TNBC cell survival and metastasis upon Doxorubicin treatment. Consistently, high miR-181a level associated with poor disease free survival and overall survival after treatments in breast cancer patients. The upregulation of miR-181a was orchestrated by transcription factor STAT3 whose activation depended on NF-κB-mediated IL-6 induction in TNBC cells upon genotoxic treatment. Intriguingly, activated STAT3 not only directly bound to MIR181A1 promoter to drive transcription but also facilitated the recruitment of MSK1 to the same region where MSK1 promoted a local active chromatin state by phosphorylating histone H3. We further identified BAX as a direct functional target of miR-181a, whose suppression decreased apoptosis and increased invasion of TNBC cells upon Dox treatment. These results were further confirmed by evidence that suppression of miR-181a significantly enhanced therapeutic response and reduced lung metastasis in a TNBC orthotopic model. Collectively, our data suggested that miR-181a induction had a critical role in promoting therapeutic resistance and aggressive behavior of TNBC cells upon genotoxic treatment. Antagonizing miR-181a may serve as a promising strategy to sensitize TNBC cells to chemotherapy and mitigate metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W1571886384,"Oxidative stress has been known to be involved in pathogenesis of dry eye disease. However, few studies have comprehensively investigated the relationship between hyperosmolarity and oxidative damage in human ocular surface. This study was to explore whether and how hyperosmolarity induces oxidative stress markers in primary human corneal epithelial cells (HCECs). Primary HCECs were established from donor limbal explants. The hyperosmolarity model was made in HCECs cultured in isosmolar (312 mOsM) or hyperosmotic (350, 400, 450 mOsM) media. Production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), oxidative damage markers, oxygenases and anti-oxidative enzymes were analyzed by DCFDA kit, RT-qPCR, immunofluorescent and immunohistochemical staining and Western blotting. Compared to isosmolar medium, ROS production significantly increased at time- and osmolarity-dependent manner in HCECs exposed to media with increasing osmolarities (350-450 mOsM). Hyperosmolarity significantly induced oxidative damage markers in cell membrane with increased toxic products of lipid peroxidation, 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) and malondialdehyde (MDA), and in nuclear and mitochondria DNA with increased aconitase-2 and 8-OHdG. Hyperosmotic stress also increased the mRNA expression and protein production of heme oxygenase-1 (HMOX1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2), but reduced the levels of antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1), and glutathione peroxidase-1 (GPX1). In conclusion, our comprehensive findings demonstrate that hyperosmolarity induces oxidative stress in HCECs by stimulating ROS production and disrupting the balance of oxygenases and antioxidant enzymes, which in turn cause cell damage with increased oxidative markers in membrane lipid peroxidation and mitochondrial DNA damage."
https://openalex.org/W1579701530,"Albuminuria contributes to the development and progression of chronic kidney disease by inducing tubulointerstitial inflammation (TI) and fibrosis. However, the exact mechanisms of TI in response to albuminuria are unresolved. We previously demonstrated that NLRP3 and inflammasomes mediate albumin-induced lesions in tubular cells. Here, we further investigated the role of endocytic receptors and lysosome rupture in NLRP3 inflammasome activation. A murine proteinuric nephropathy model was induced by albumin overload as described previously. The priming and activation signals for inflammasome complex formation were evoked simultaneously by albumin excess in tubular epithelial cells. The former signal was dependent on a albumin-triggered NF-κB pathway activation. This process is mediated by the endocytic receptor, megalin and cubilin. However, the silencing of megalin or cubilin inhibited the albumin-induced NLRP3 signal. Notably, subsequent lysosome rupture and the corresponding release of lysosomal hydrolases, especially cathepsin B, were observed in tubular epithelial cells exposed to albumin. Cathepsin B release and distribution are essential for NLRP3 signal activation, and inhibitors of cathepsin B suppressed the NLRP3 signal in tubular epithelial cells. Taken together, our findings suggest that megalin/cubilin and lysosome rupture are involved in albumin-triggered tubular injury and TI. This study provides novel insights into albuminuria-induced TI and implicates the active control of albuminuria as a critical strategy to halt the progression of chronic kidney disease."
https://openalex.org/W1542666708,"KRAS and BRAF are among the most commonly mutated oncogenes in human cancer that contribute to tumorigenesis in both distinct and overlapping tissues. However, KRAS and BRAF mutations are mutually exclusive; they never occur in the same tumor cell. The reason for the mutual exclusivity is unknown, but there are several possibilities. The two mutations could be functionally redundant and not create a selective advantage to tumor cells. Alternatively, they could be deleterious for the tumor cell and induce apoptosis or senescence. To distinguish between these possibilities, we activated the expression of BRAF(V600E) and KRAS(G12D) from their endogenous promoters in mouse lungs. Although the tumor-forming ability of BRAF(V600E) was higher than KRAS(G12D), KRAS(G12D) tumors were larger and more advanced. Coactivation of BRAF(V600E) and KRAS(G12D) markedly reduced lung tumor numbers and overall tumor burden compared with activation of BRAF(V600E) alone. Moreover, several tumors expressed only one oncogene, suggesting negative selection against expression of both. Similarly, expression of both oncogenes in mouse embryonic fibroblasts essentially stopped proliferation. The expression of both oncogenes hyperactivated the MEK-ERK-cyclin D pathway but reduced proliferation by increasing the production of p15, p16 and p19 proteins encoded by the Ink4/Arf locus and thereby increased senescence-associated β-galactosidase-positive cells. The data suggest that coexpression of BRAF(V600E) and KRAS(G12D) in early tumorigenesis leads to negative selection due to oncogene-induced senescence."
https://openalex.org/W391225997,"In vitro activation and growth of primordial dormant follicles to produce fertilizable oocytes would provide a useful instrument for fertility preservation. The employment of Phosphatase and TENsin homolog (PTEN) inhibitors, in combination with Protein kinase B (Akt) stimulating molecules, has been previously employed to increase follicular activation through the stimulation of the PTEN-Akt pathway.We aim to establish improved in vitro activation also for cancer patients whose ovarian tissue has already been cryopreserved. Fresh and previously cryopreserved human ovarian cortex were exposed to short-term, low-concentration and ovary-specific treatment with only a PTEN inhibitor.Our in vitro activation protocol enhances the activation mechanisms of primordial follicles in both fresh and cryopreserved samples, and enlarges growing populations without inducing apoptosis in either follicles or the surrounding stroma. Treatment augments estradiol secretion and restores the expression levels of the previously diminished Anti-Müllerian hormone by means of cryopreservation procedures. Genomic modulation of the relative expression of PTEN pathway genes was found in treated samples.The in vitro activation protocol offers new alternatives for patients with cryopreserved tissue as it increases the pool of viable activated follicles available for in vitro growth procedures. The combination of ovarian tissue cryopreservation and in vitro activation of primordial follicles, the main ovarian reserve component, will be a major advancement in fertility preservation."
https://openalex.org/W1522378176,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, and is on the rise in the United States. Previous studies showed that the matricellular protein CCN1 (CYR61) is induced during hepatic injuries and functions to restrict and resolve liver fibrosis. Here, we show that CCN1 suppresses hepatocarcinogenesis by inhibiting carcinogen-induced compensatory hepatocyte proliferation, thus limiting the expansion of damaged and potentially oncogenic hepatocytes. Consistent with tumor suppression, CCN1 expression is downregulated in human HCC. Ccn1(ΔHep) mice with hepatocyte-specific deletion of Ccn1 suffer increased HCC tumor multiplicity induced by the hepatocarcinogen diethylnitrosamine (DEN). Knockin mice (Ccn1(dm/dm)) that express an integrin α6β1-binding defective CCN1 phenocopied Ccn1(ΔHep) mice, indicating that CCN1 acts through its α6β1 binding sites in this context. CCN1 effectively inhibits epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-dependent hepatocyte proliferation through integrin α6-mediated accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), thereby triggering p53 activation and cell cycle block. Consequently, Ccn1(dm/dm) mice exhibit diminished p53 activation and elevated compensatory hepatocyte proliferation, resulting in increased HCC. Furthermore, we show that a single dose of the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib delivered prior to DEN-induced injury was sufficient to block compensatory proliferation and annihilate development of HCC nodules observed 8 months later, suggesting potential chemoprevention by targeting CCN1-inhibitable EGFR-dependent hepatocyte proliferation. Together, these results show that CCN1 is an injury response protein that functions not only to restrict fibrosis in the liver, but also to suppress hepatocarcinogenesis by inhibiting EGFR-dependent hepatocyte compensatory proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W1508744245,"Airway mucin secretion studies have focused on goblet cell responses to exogenous agonists almost to the exclusion of baseline mucin secretion (BLMS). In human bronchial epithelial cell cultures (HBECCs), maximal agonist-stimulated secretion exceeds baseline by ~3-fold as measured over hour-long periods, but mucin stores are discharged completely and require 24 h for full restoration. Hence, over 24 h, total baseline exceeds agonist-induced secretion by several-fold. Studies with HBECCs and mouse tracheas showed that BLMS is highly sensitive to mechanical stresses. Harvesting three consecutive 1 h baseline luminal incubations with HBECCs yielded equal rates of BLMS; however, lengthening the middle period to 72 h decreased the respective rate significantly, suggesting a stimulation of BLMS by the gentle washes of HBECC luminal surfaces. BLMS declined exponentially after washing HBECCs (t1/2 = 2.75 h), to rates approaching zero. HBECCs exposed to low perfusion rates exhibited spike-like increases in BLMS when flow was jumped 5-fold: BLMS increased >4 fold, then decreased within 5 min to a stable plateau at 1.5–2-fold over control. Higher flow jumps induced proportionally higher BLMS increases. Inducing mucous hyperplasia in HBECCs increased mucin production, BLMS and agonist-induced secretion. Mouse tracheal BLMS was ~6-fold higher during perfusion, than when flow was stopped. Munc13-2 null mouse tracheas, with their defect of accumulated cellular mucins, exhibited similar BLMS as WT, contrary to predictions of lower values. Graded mucous metaplasia induced in WT and Munc13-2 null tracheas with IL-13, caused proportional increases in BLMS, suggesting that naïve Munc13-2 mouse BLMS is elevated by increased mucin stores. We conclude that BLMS is, [i] a major component of mucin secretion in the lung, [ii] sustained by the mechanical activity of a dynamic lung, [iii] proportional to levels of mucin stores, and [iv] regulated differentially from agonist-induced mucin secretion."

https://openalex.org/W1488165686,"Cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) is a known regulator in the cell cycle control of the G1/S and S/G2 transitions. However, the role of CDK2 in tumorigenesis is controversial. Evidence from knockout mice as well as colon cancer cell lines indicated that CDK2 is dispensable for cell proliferation. In this study, we found that ectopic CDK2 enhances Ras (G12V)-induced foci formation and knocking down CDK2 expression markedly decreases epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced cell transformation mediated through the downregulation of c-fos expression. Interestingly, CDK2 directly phosphorylates ELK4 at Thr194 and Ser387 and regulates the ELK4 transcriptional activity, which serves as a mechanism to regulate c-fos expression. In addition, ELK4 is overexpressed in melanoma and knocking down the ELK4 or CDK2 expression significantly attenuated the malignant phenotype of melanoma cells. Taken together, our study reveals a novel function of CDK2 in EGF-induced cell transformation and the associated signal transduction pathways. This indicates that CDK2 is a useful molecular target for the chemoprevention and therapy against skin cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1574034225,"Objective Advances made in the past ten years highlight the notion that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors gamma (PPARγ) has protective properties in the pathophysiology of osteoarthritis (OA). The aim of this study was to define the roles of PPARγ in AGEs-induced inflammatory response in human chondrocytes. Methods Primary human chondrocytes were stimulated with AGEs in the presence or absence of neutralizing antibody against RAGE (anti-RAGE), MAPK specific inhibitors and PPARγ agonist pioglitazone. The expression of IL-1, MMP-13, TNF-α, PPARγ, nuclear NF-κB p65 and cytosol IκBα was determined by western blotting and real-time PCR. Results AGEs could enhance the expression of IL-1, TNF-α, and MMP-13, but the level of PPARγ was decreased in a time- and dose-dependent manner, which was inhibited by anti-RAGE, SB203580 (P38 MAPK specific inhibitor) and SP600125 (a selective inhibitor of JNK). PPARγ agonist pioglitazone could inhibit the effects of AGEs-induced inflammatory response and PPARγ down-regulation. In human chondrocytes, AGEs could induce cytosol IκBα degradation and increase the level of nuclear NF-κB p65, which was inhibited by PPARγ agonist pioglitazone. Conclusions In primary human chondrocytes, AGEs could down-regulate PPARγ expression and increase the inflammatory mediators, which could be reversed by PPARγ agonist pioglitazone. Activation of RAGE by AGEs triggers a cascade of downstream signaling, including MAPK JNK/ p38, PPARγ and NF-κB. Taken together, PPARγ could be a potential target for pharmacologic intervention in the treatment of OA."
https://openalex.org/W1484359909,"BRCA1 and BRCA2 are the two major genes predisposing to breast and ovarian cancer. Whereas high de novo mutation rates have been demonstrated for several genes, only 11 cases of de novo BRCA1/2 mutations have been reported to date and the BRCA1/2 de novo mutation rate remains unknown. The present study was designed to fill this gap based on a series of 12 805 consecutive unrelated patients diagnosed with breast and/or ovarian cancer who met the inclusion criteria for BRCA1/2 gene analysis according to French guidelines. BRCA1/2 mutations were detected in 1527 (12%) patients, and three BRCA1 mutations and one BRCA2 mutation were de novo. The BRCA1/2 de novo mutation rate was estimated to be 0.3% (0.1%; 0.7%). Although rare, it may be useful to take the possibility of de novo BRCA1/2 mutation into account in genetic counseling of relatives and to improve the understanding of complex family histories of breast and ovarian cancers."
https://openalex.org/W1541701590,"Conflicts fueled by popular religious mobilization have rekindled the controversy surrounding Samuel Huntington's theory of changing international alignments in the Post-Cold War era. In The Clash of Civilizations, Huntington challenged Fukuyama's ""end of history"" thesis that liberal democracy had emerged victorious out of Post-war ideological and economic rivalries. Based on a top-down analysis of the alignments of nation states, Huntington famously concluded that the axes of international geo-political conflicts had reverted to the ancient cultural divisions that had characterized most of human history. Until recently, however, the debate has had to rely more on polemics than empirical evidence. Moreover, Huntington made this prediction in 1993, before social media connected the world's population. Do digital communications attenuate or echo the cultural, religious, and ethnic ""fault lines"" posited by Huntington prior to the global diffusion of social media? We revisit Huntington's thesis using hundreds of millions of anonymized email and Twitter communications among tens of millions of worldwide users to map the global alignment of interpersonal relations. Contrary to the supposedly borderless world of cyberspace, a bottom-up analysis confirms the persistence of the eight culturally differentiated civilizations posited by Huntington, with the divisions corresponding to differences in language, religion, economic development, and spatial distance."
https://openalex.org/W1543533354,"The histone variant, macroH2A1, has an important role in embryonic stem cell differentiation and tumor progression in various types of tumors. However, the regulatory roles of macroH2A1 on bladder cancer progression have not been fully elucidated. Here, we show that macroH2A1 knockdown promotes stem-like properties of bladder cancer cells. The knockdown of macroH2A1 in bladder cancer cells increased tumorigenicity, radioresistance, degeneration of reactive oxygen species, increased sphere formation capability and an increase in the proportion of side populations. We found that macroH2A1 is required for the suppression of Lin28B identified as a novel downstream target of macroH2A1 in bladder cancer. Loss of macroH2A1 expression significantly correlated with the elevated levels of Lin28B expression and subsequently inhibited the mature let-7 microRNA expression. Furthermore, the stable overexpression of Lin28B enhances the several phenotypes, including tumorigenicity and sphere-forming ability, which are induced by macroH2A1 depletion. Importantly, Lin28B expression was regulated by macroH2A1-mediated reciprocal binding of p300 and EZH2/SUV39H1. Our results suggest that Lin28B/let-7 pathway is tightly regulated by macroH2A1 and its cofactors, and have a pivotal role in the bladder tumor progression and the regulation of stem-like characteristics of bladder cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W561948035,"In seasonally snow-covered environments, many organisms endure winter by using the subnivium, a below-snow thermally stable seasonal refugium. Because the insulation of snow is dependent on snow depth and density, the stability of temperatures within the subnivium varies across land cover types. Additionally, across much of the Northern Hemisphere snow extent, depth and duration are generally decreasing while snow density is increasing due to climate change. These changes are likely to destabilize the thermal profile of the subnivium, although they have not yet been quantified. To explore the effects of land cover and climate change on the subnivium, we measured snow pack characteristics (depth and density), and ambient and subnivium temperatures from three different land cover types (prairie, deciduous forest, and coniferous forest) and within a micro-greenhouse (2.5 x 2.5 x 2 m) that maintained a temperature of 5 °C warmer than outdoor ambient temperatures, and automatically opened during snow events throughout the winter of 2013/14. We found that the mean daily subnivium temperature was significantly colder in the deciduous cover type than the prairie cover type, and that prairie had higher maximum subnivium temperatures than both of the other cover types. Our climate change simulation revealed that, although ambient temperatures within the micro-greenhouse were 5 °C warmer than outside the greenhouse, the daily minimum subnivium temperature was significantly lower inside the greenhouse. Our findings suggest that climate change could have considerable effects on the refuge quality of the subnivium, and that some cover types appear to be more susceptible to these effects than others."
https://openalex.org/W1602913332,"Among frequent events in prostate cancer are loss of the tumor-suppressor phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) and overexpression of prostate-specific G-protein-coupled receptor (PSGR), but the potential tumorigenic synergy between these lesions is unknown. Here, we report a new mouse model (PSGR-PtenΔ/Δ) combining prostate-specific loss of Pten with probasin promoter-driven PSGR overexpression. By 12 months PSGR-PtenΔ/Δ mice developed invasive prostate tumors featuring Akt activation and extensive inflammatory cell infiltration. PSGR-PtenΔ/Δ tumors exhibited E-cadherin loss and increased stromal androgen receptor (AR) expression. PSGR overexpression increased LNCaP proliferation, whereas PSGR short hairpin RNA knockdown inhibited proliferation and migration. In conclusion, we demonstrate that PSGR overexpression synergizes with loss of PTEN to accelerate prostate cancer development, and present a novel bigenic mouse model that mimics the human condition, where both PSGR overexpression and loss of PTEN occur concordantly in the majority of advanced prostate cancers, yielding an environment more relevant to studying human prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1802190645,"Apolipoprotein C-II (apoC-II) is the co-factor for lipoprotein lipase (LPL) at the surface of triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins. LPL hydrolyzes triacylglycerol, which increases local surface pressure as surface area decreases and amphipathic products transiently accumulate at the lipoprotein surface. To understand how apoC-II adapts to these pressure changes, we characterized the behavior of apoC-II at multiple lipid/water interfaces. ApoC-II adsorption to a triacylglycerol/water interface resulted in large increases in surface pressure. ApoC-II was exchangeable at this interface and desorbed on interfacial compressions. These compressions increase surface pressure and mimic the action of LPL. Analysis of gradual compressions showed that apoC-II undergoes a two-step desorption, which indicates that lipid-bound apoC-II can exhibit at least two conformations. We characterized apoC-II at phospholipid/triacylglycerol/water interfaces, which more closely mimic lipoprotein surfaces. ApoC-II had a large exclusion pressure, similar to that of apoC-I and apoC-III. However, apoC-II desorbed at retention pressures higher than those seen with the other apoCs. This suggests that it is unlikely that apoC-I and apoC-III inhibit LPL via displacement of apoC-II from the lipoprotein surface. Upon rapid compressions and re-expansions, re-adsorption of apoC-II increased pressure by lower amounts than its initial adsorption.

No published information is available regarding epidemiological data on vitamin D status in the Romanian population for a wide age range and geographical territory. In this context, we aimed to evaluate the seasonal and age variation of vitamin D status in a large Romanian population.6631 individuals from across Romania had performed 7544 vitamin D assessments (2012-2014) in a chain of private laboratories. Vitamin D (25-hydroxyvitamin D2 and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3) was measured using High Performance Liquid Chromatography. Vitamin D levels were classified as severe deficiency<10 ng/mL, deficiency 10-20 ng/mL, insufficiency 21-29 ng/mL, sufficiency ≥ 30 ng/mL and potentially harmful>100 ng/ml.Male to female ratio was 1:2.9. Age ranged from 0 to 85 years. Mean vitamin D levels increased from April (26.3n g/ml) to September (35.6 ng/ml) and decreased from October (33.5 ng/ml) to March (24.4 ng/ml). Overall 40% had sufficient vitamin D, while the rest were insufficient 33%, deficient 22%, severely deficient 4% and 1% potentially harmful (of them 81% under 1 year old). Males compared to females showed higher percentages of sufficiency (47% vs. 38%). Children 0- 2 years presented the highest percentage of vitamin D sufficiency (77%). Lowest percentages (21%) of sufficiency were in people 80-84 years.In Romania, suboptimal vitamin D levels are common (59%), especially in older age, wintertime and in women. Vitamin D supplementation would be most warranted from January to April in the Romanian population. 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels > 100 ng/ml were relatively prevalent in children 0-1 year old (17.3%). This was attributed to supplementation errors and the fact that high-risk individuals were more likely to visit for medical check-up. Nonetheless, it stresses the need to increase awareness of the importance of preventing Vitamin D supplementation administration errors in the young."

The dataset included 129,991 VA patients presenting for emergency care between 2008 and 2012 (91% males; 61% non-Hispanic White, 28% Black, 7% Hispanic, 2% Asian, <1% American Indian/Alaska Native, 1% mixed ethnicity) and 774 nurses for a total of 359,642 patient/examiner encounters. Approximately 13% of the variance in ESI scores was due to patient characteristics and 21% was due to the nurse characteristics. After controlling for characteristics of nurses and patients, Black patients were assigned less urgent ESI scores than White patients, and this effect was more prominent for Black males compared with Black females. A similar interaction was found for Hispanic males. It remains unclear how these results may generalize to EDs and patient populations outside of the U.S. VA Health Care system.The findings suggest the possibility that subgroups of VA patients receive different ESI ratings in triage, which may have cascading, downstream consequences for patient treatment quality, satisfaction with care, and trust in the health equity of emergency care."
https://openalex.org/W1488744092,"To study the physiological roles of polyamines, we carried out a global microarray analysis on the effect of adding polyamines to an Escherichia coli mutant that lacks polyamines because of deletions in the genes in the polyamine biosynthetic pathway. Previously, we have reported that the earliest response to polyamine addition is the increased expression of the genes for the glutamate-dependent acid resistance system (GDAR). We also presented preliminary evidence for the involvement of rpoS and gadE regulators. In the current study, further confirmation of the regulatory roles of rpoS and gadE is shown by a comparison of genome-wide expression profiling data from a series of microarrays comparing the genes induced by polyamine addition to polyamine-free rpoS+/gadE+ cells with genes induced by polyamine addition to polyamine-free ΔrpoS/gadE+ and rpoS+/ΔgadE cells. The results indicate that most of the genes in the E. coli GDAR system that are induced by polyamines require rpoS and gadE. Our data also show that gadE is the main regulator of GDAR and other acid fitness island genes. Both polyamines and rpoS are necessary for the expression of gadE gene from the three promoters of gadE (P1, P2, and P3). The most important effect of polyamine addition is the very rapid increase in the level of RpoS sigma factor. Our current hypothesis is that polyamines increase the level of RpoS protein and that this increased RpoS level is responsible for the stimulation of gadE expression, which in turn induces the GDAR system in E. coli.

Polyamines (putrescine, spermidine, or spermine) are polycationic aliphatic bases that are abundantly present in all organisms from bacteria to humans. Polyamines have been implicated in many biological processes, including nucleic acid and protein synthesis and structure, cell growth, binding to membrane phospholipids, N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors, and protection against oxygen toxicity (1Tabor C.W.

However, despite many studies in many laboratories, the specific in vivo targets of the polyamines and the detailed mechanism of most of their effects have been uncertain. To answer these questions, we have studied the effects of adding polyamines to a mutant strain of Escherichia coli that contains no polyamines because of deletions in the genes responsible for polyamine biosynthesis. We have used microarray techniques to study which genes are induced by addition of polyamines to this polyamine-deficient mutant. We found that the genes most rapidly induced by polyamines are the genes involved in the glutamate-dependent acid resistance pathway (GDAR) 2The abbreviations used are: GDARglutamate-dependent acid resistanceGADglutamic acid decarboxylaseADARarginine-dependent acid resistanceLDARlysine-dependent acid resistanceODARornithine-dependent acid resistance. and that polyamines are required for their induction (9Chattopadhyay M.K.

The systems involved in the acid resistance of bacteria have been of particular interest over many years, particularly because resistance to the high acidity of the stomach contents is a prerequisite for host colonization in food-borne pathogens (10Gorden J.

Four of these acid resistance systems depend on the decarboxylation of amino acids by pyridoxal phosphate-dependent decarboxylase such as glutamate decarboxylase (13Richard H.T. Foster J.W.

Of these, the glutamate-dependent acid resistance system is the most effective in protecting cells against an extreme acid environment and has been extensively studied, especially by Foster and others (13Richard H.T. Foster J.W. Acid resistance in Escherichia coli.Adv. Appl. Microbiol. 2003; 52: 167-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 14Foster J.W.

Microbiol. 2012; 86: 770-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The mechanism of the glutamate-dependent acid resistance involves the decarboxylation of glutamate by two glutamic acid decarboxylase (encoded by gadA and gadB) and export of the resultant γ-aminobutyric acid by the antiporter gadC, with the resultant loss of intracellular protons (14Foster J.W.

Microbiol. 2012; 86: 770-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In our earlier studies, direct enzymatic assays were made to assess the changes in glutamate decarboxylase levels after polyamine addition to polyamine-deficient cells (9Chattopadhyay M.K. Tabor H. Polyamines are critical for the induction of the glutamate decarboxylase-dependent acid resistance system in Escherichia coli.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 33559-33570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We found that polyamines are essential for this induction, confirming other studies by Jung and Kim (19Jung I.L. Kim I.G. Polyamines and glutamate decarboxylase-based acid resistance in Escherichia coli.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22846-22852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). During these studies, we presented preliminary evidence that two regulatory factors rpoS and gadE are important for this induction by polyamines of the glutamate-dependent-acid resistance system. However, it was not clear how these genes were involved in the polyamine induction of the GDAR system. The significance of RpoS was of particular interest because of its role as a regulatory subunit of bacterial RNA polymerase. In addition to five core subunits (two α, one β, one β′, and one ω), bacterial RNA polymerase contains one of the seven regulatory subunits called sigma, whose composition varies slightly in different versions of the polymerase to form the holoenzyme. One of these versions is called sigma38 (RpoS), and it has been studied extensively because it is markedly induced in response to various stress factors and in cells reaching stationary growth phase (20Sammartano L.J.

Elucidating the function of the RpoS regulon.Future Microbiol. 2014; 9: 497-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). How gadE is activated by polyamines in regulating the GDAR system is of interest because of the extensive literature (unrelated to polyamines) showing the regulatory action of gadE on many components of the GDAR and other acid resistance genes (29Masuda N. Church G.M. Regulatory network of acid resistance genes in Escherichia coli.Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 699-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 30Ma Z. Gong S. Richard H. Tucker D.L.

GadE (YhiE): a novel activator involved in the response to acid environment in Escherichia coli.Microbiology. 2004; 150: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The gadE gene is located between hdeD and yhiU at the center of a 12-gene acid fitness island and contains an upstream sensory region comprising three different promoters (32Sayed A.K. Foster J.W. A 750 bp sensory integration region directs global control of the Escherichia coli GadE acid resistance regulator.Mol. Microbiol. 2009; 71: 1435-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The present paper reports our current studies on the involvement of these two factors in the polyamine response in greater detail. We postulate a cascade model in which the primary action of the polyamine addition to the polyamine-deficient cells is the very rapid increase in the RpoS level with subsequent induction of gadE expression that in turn increases the GDAR system. This demonstration of the effect of polyamines in rapidly increasing the RpoS level is of importance not only for understanding the requirement of polyamines for the glutamate-dependent acid response system but also for the likely role of the polyamines in regulating the large number of systems already known to involve RpoS and to be induced by various stress conditions. The E. coli strains and plasmids and their source are listed in Table 1. An E. coli mutant lacking polyamines was developed by sequential deletion of seven genes in the polyamine biosynthetic pathway to construct HT873 strain (see footnote to Table 1). All strains were constructed in the background of BW25113 (CGSC7636), parent of the Keio collection (33Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L.

Chem. 1956; 218: 97-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) containing 0.4% glucose and supplemented with different concentrations of amines as indicated. Incubations were at 37 °C with shaking in air. For strains containing plasmids, the appropriate antibiotic was added: 20 μg/ml chloramphenicol for strains containing the pArpoS plasmid or 100 μg/ml of carbenicillin for the strain containing the pQEgadE plasmid. For the microarray experiments, polyamine-free mutants (HT873, HT874, and HT875) were inoculated from an LB plate in triplicate into amine-free M9 minimal medium. The cultures were deprived of contaminating amines (obtained from the prior growth in LB) by growing them overnight in amine-free medium. Then the cultures were diluted to A600 of 0.2 and grown until the A600 reached 1.0. Each culture was divided into two parts. To one part, a mixture of putrescine and spermidine was added to a final concentration of 100 μm; the other part was left untreated and used as a control. Both cultures were harvested 60 min after amine addition. Total RNA from each sample was isolated as described previously (38Chattopadhyay M.K. Chen W. Tabor H. Escherichia coli glutathionylspermidine synthetase/amidase: phylogeny and effect on regulation of gene expression.FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2013; 338: 132-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Briefly, for each RNA isolation, 109–1010 cells were resuspended in Tris-EDTA buffer (100 mm Tris, 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) containing 2 mg/ml lysozyme (Sigma), and RNA was isolated according to the protocol described in the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). The mRNAs were enriched from total RNA by removing the 16S and 23S ribosomal RNAs using the MICROBExpress method and kit (Ambion/Life Technologies; part AM1905) and used for microarray analysis in the NIDDK genomic core facility. The enriched mRNA (40 ng/reaction) was reverse transcribed and amplified using an Ovation WTA pico-V2 kit (part 3302; NuGEN, San Carlos, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 2.5 μg of cDNA was fragmented, biotinylated and then hybridized for 18 h to E. coli GeneChip arrays (Genome 2.0 array; Affymetrix Santa Clara, CA; n = 3 each for each sample). Hybridized arrays were washed and stained with Affymetrix WHS kit (catalog no. 900720) using Fluidic Station 450. Arrays were scanned using a GeneChip scanner 3000 7G (Affymetrix) operated by Affymetrix GeneChip Command Console software. Analysis of variance was performed and p values were calculated using Partek Pro software (Partek, St. Louis, MO) and plotted as the negative log on the y axis against the Affimetrix signal ratios for each probe set on the x axis. Up- and down-regulated genes were selected for further study based on p values of <0.05 and fold change >+2 or −2. To identify the motif of GadE and RpoS binding sites on the DNA of the induced genes, the pattern search tool in coliBASE was used.

Three cDNA replicates from each of rpoS+/gadE+ and mutant groups, ΔrpoS/gadE+ and rpoS+/ΔgadE were used for quantitative real time PCR assays.

For each reaction 10 μl of 2× SyBr Green master mix (Bio-Rad), 400 nmol from each 5′ and 3′ primer, and 500 pg of cDNA were mixed in a total volume of 20 μl. Each reaction was set up in triplicate in a 96-well plate. Samples were heated at 95 °C for 10 min to activate the enzymes followed by 95 °C denaturing for 15 s and 60 °C annealing and extension for 75 s, and the cycle was repeated 40 times. Melt curve analysis (65–95 °C, 0.5 °C increments) showed a single amplified product for each well. The data were analyzed using Bio-Rad CFX manager (version 3.1) software, and relative expression levels were derived using HT873, without added polyamines as the controls. For further analysis of the level of rpoS gene induction by polyamines (see Fig. 5, A and B), cultures were grown without amines as mentioned above, and when the cultures reached an A600 of 1.0, in part of the culture, polyamines (100 μm each of putrescine and spermidine) were added, and the cultures were harvested after 10, 20, and 60 min. Another part of the culture was untreated and used as minus amine culture. RNA was isolated as above, ribosomal RNAs were removed, and cDNAs were synthesized using SuperScript Vilo (Life Technologies). 1.0 ng of cDNA was used for each quantitative real time PCR analyses using gapA as control, following the Bio-Rad protocol as mentioned above. One-step reverse transcriptase-PCR method was used to amplify mRNA using Superscript III and platinum Taq high fidelity polymerase mixtures according to the manufacturer's protocol (Life Technologies).

https://openalex.org/W2215968477,"Considerable studies indicate huperzine A is a promising natural product to suppress neuronal damages induced by β-amyloid (Aβ), a key pathogenic event in the Alzheimer's disease (AD). As an extension, the present study for the first time explored whether the beneficial profiles of huperzine A against oligomeric Aβ(42) induced neurotoxicity are associated with the accumulation and detrimental function of intraneuronal/mitochondrial Aβ, on the basis of the emerging evidence that intracellular Aβ is more relevant to AD progression as compared with extracellular Aβ. Huperzine A treatment was shown to significantly attenuate the neurotoxicity of oligomeric Aβ(42), as demonstrated by increased neuronal viability. Interestingly, our results proved that exogenous Aβ(42) could accumulate intraneuronally in a dose- and time-dependent manner, while huperzine A treatment markedly reduced the level of intracellular Aβ(42). Moreover, huperzine A treatment rescued mitochondrial dysfunction induced by oligomeric Aβ(42), including adenosine triphosphate (ATP) reduction, reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction and membrane potential depolarization. Further study demonstrated that huperzine A also significantly reduced the level of Aβ(42) in the mitochondria-enriched subcellular fractions, as well as the Aβ(42) fluorescent signals colocalized with mitochondrial marker. This study indicates that interfering intracellular Aβ especially mitochondrial Aβ accumulation, together with ameliorating Aβ-associated mitochondrial dysfunction, may contribute to the protective effects of huperzine A against Aβ neurotoxicity. Above results may shed more light on the pharmacological mechanisms of huperzine A and provide important clues for discovering novel therapeutic strategies for AD."
https://openalex.org/W1817073119,"HAMLET (Human Alpha-lactalbumin Made LEthal to Tumor cells) kills tumor cells broadly suggesting that conserved survival pathways are perturbed. We now identify nucleotide-binding proteins as HAMLET binding partners, accounting for about 35% of all HAMLET targets in a protein microarray comprising 8000 human proteins. Target kinases were present in all branches of the Kinome tree, including 26 tyrosine kinases, 10 tyrosine kinase-like kinases, 13 homologs of yeast sterile kinases, 4 casein kinase 1 kinases, 15 containing PKA, PKG, PKC family kinases, 15 calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinases and 13 kinases from CDK, MAPK, GSK3, CLK families. HAMLET acted as a broad kinase inhibitor in vitro, as defined in a screen of 347 wild-type, 93 mutant, 19 atypical and 17 lipid kinases. Inhibition of phosphorylation was also detected in extracts from HAMLET-treated lung carcinoma cells. In addition, HAMLET recognized 24 Ras family proteins and bound to Ras, RasL11B and Rap1B on the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane. Direct cellular interactions between HAMLET and activated Ras family members including Braf were confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation. As a consequence, oncogenic Ras and Braf activity was inhibited and HAMLET and Braf inhibitors synergistically increased tumor cell death in response to HAMLET. Unlike most small molecule kinase inhibitors, HAMLET showed selectivity for tumor cells in vitro and in vivo. The results identify nucleotide-binding proteins as HAMLET targets and suggest that dysregulation of the ATPase/kinase/GTPase machinery contributes to cell death, following the initial, selective recognition of HAMLET by tumor cells. The findings thus provide a molecular basis for the conserved tumoricidal effect of HAMLET, through dysregulation of kinases and oncogenic GTPases, to which tumor cells are addicted."
https://openalex.org/W1679586719,"The rumen microbial ecosystem is a complex system where rumen fermentation processes involve interactions among microorganisms. There are important relationships between diet and the ruminal bacterial composition. Thus, we investigated the ruminal fermentation characteristics and compared ruminal bacterial communities using tag amplicon pyrosequencing analysis in Yanbian yellow steers, which were fed linseed oil (LO) and propionate precursors. We used eight ruminally cannulated Yanbian yellow steers (510 ± 5.8 kg) in a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square design with four dietary treatments. Steers were fed a basal diet that comprised 80% concentrate and 20% rice straw (DM basis, CON). The CON diet was supplemented with LO at 4%. The LO diet was also supplemented with 2% dl-malate or 2% fumarate as ruminal precursors of propionate. Dietary supplementation with LO and propionate precursors increased ruminal pH, total volatile fatty acid concentrations, and the molar proportion of propionate. The most abundant bacterial operational taxonomic units in the rumen were related to dietary treatments. Bacteroidetes dominated the ruminal bacterial community and the genus Prevotella was highly represented when steers were fed LO plus propionate precursors. However, with the CON and LO diet plus malate or fumarate, Firmicutes was the most abundant phylum and the genus Ruminococcus was predominant. In summary, supplementing the diets of ruminants with a moderate level of LO plus propionate precursors modified the ruminal fermentation pattern. The most positive responses to LO and propionate precursors supplementation were in the phyla Bacteriodetes and Firmicutes, and in the genus Ruminococcus and Prevotella. Thus, diets containing LO plus malate or fumarate have significant effects on the composition of the rumen microbial community."

A significant mechanism in HD is the generation of mutant HTT fragments, which are generally more toxic than the full-length HTT. The protein fragments observed in human HD tissue and mouse models of HD are formed by proteolysis or aberrant splicing of HTT. To systematically investigate the relative contribution of the various HTT protein proteolysis events observed in vivo, we generated transgenic mouse models of HD representing five distinct proteolysis fragments ending at amino acids 171, 463, 536, 552, and 586 with a polyglutamine length of 148. All lines contain a single integration at the ROSA26 locus, with expression of the fragments driven by the chicken β-actin promoter at nearly identical levels. The transgenic mice N171-Q148 and N552-Q148 display significantly accelerated phenotypes and a shortened life span when compared with N463-Q148, N536-Q148, and N586-Q148 transgenic mice. We hypothesized that the accelerated phenotype was due to altered HTT protein interactions/complexes that accumulate with age. We found evidence for altered HTT complexes in caspase-2 fragment transgenic mice (N552-Q148) and a stronger interaction with the endogenous HTT protein. These findings correlate with an altered HTT molecular complex and distinct proteins in the HTT interactome set identified by mass spectrometry. In particular, we identified HSP90AA1 (HSP86) as a potential modulator of the distinct neurotoxicity of the caspase-2 fragment mice (N552-Q148) when compared with the caspase-6 transgenic mice (N586-Q148).

https://openalex.org/W1563624833,"Human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUCB-MSCs) secrete various beneficial molecules, which have anti-apoptotic activity and cell proliferation. However, the effect of hUCB-MSCs in melanogenesis is largely unclear. In this study, we show that conditioned media (CM) derived from hUCB-MSCs inhibit melanogenesis by regulating microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) expression via the ERK signalling pathway. Treatment of hUCB-MSC-CM strongly inhibited the alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone-induced hyperpigmentation in melanoma cells as well as melanocytes. Treatment of hUCB-MSC-CM induced ERK1/2 activation in melanocytes. In addition, inhibition of ERK1/2 suppressed the anti-pigmentation activity of the hUCB-MSC-CM in melanocytes and in vitro artificial skin models. We also found that the expression of MITF was appreciably diminished while expression of phosphorylated MITF, which leads to its proteasomal degradation, was increased in cells treated with hUCB-MSC-CM. These results suggested that hUCB-MSC-CM significantly suppresses melanin synthesis via MITF degradation by the ERK pathway activation."
https://openalex.org/W1547049148,"Mutations in Bloom helicase (BLM) lead to Bloom Syndrome (BS). BS is characterized by multiple clinical manifestations including predisposition to a wide spectrum of cancers. Studies have revealed the mechanism of BLM recruitment after stalled replication and its role during the repair of DNA damage. We now provide evidence that BLM undergoes K48-linked ubiquitylation and subsequent degradation during mitosis due to the E3 ligase, Fbw7α. Fbw7α carries out its function after GSK3β- and CDK2/cyclin A2-dependent phosphorylation events on Thr171 and Ser175 of BLM which lies within a well-defined phosphodegron, a sequence which is conserved in all primates. Phosphorylation on BLM Thr171 and Ser175 depends on prior phosphorylation at Thr182 by Chk1/Chk2. Thr182 phosphorylation not only controls BLM ubiquitylation and degradation during mitosis but is also a determinant for its localization on the ultrafine bridges. Consequently lack of Thr182 phosphorylation leads to multiple manifestations of chromosomal instability including increased levels of DNA damage, lagging chromatin, micronuclei formation, breaks and quadriradials. Hence Thr182 phosphorylation on BLM has two functions-it regulates BLM turnover during mitosis and also helps to maintain the chromosomal stability."

In this study, we investigated the relationship between a 4,977-bp deletion in the mitochondrial genome (ΔmtDNA4977) and the severity of clinical symptoms in patients with mitochondrial disease lacking known point mutations. A total of 160 patients with mitochondrial disease and 101 healthy controls were recruited for this study. The copy numbers of ΔmtDNA4977 and wild-type mtDNA were determined by real-time quantitative PCR and analyzed using Spearman’s bivariate correlation analysis, t-tests, or one-way ANOVA. The overall ΔmtDNA4977 copy number per cell and the proportion of mtDNA4977 relative to the total wild-type mtDNA, increased with patient age and symptom severity. Surprisingly, the total mtDNA copy number decreased with increasing symptom severity. Our analyses revealed that increases in the proportion and total copy number of ΔmtDNA4977 in the blood may be associated with disease severity in patients with mitochondrial dysfunction."

These “channel” nucleoporins each contain an ordered region of ∼150–200 residues, which is predicted to be segmented into 3–4 α-helical regions of ∼40–80 residues. Notably, these segmentations are evolutionarily conserved between uni- and multicellular eukaryotes.

In this study, we report data on assembly and disassembly of complexes formed by the ordered region of each of the three channel nups. By employing several biochemical and biophysical approaches, we found that these fragments form dynamic assemblies of heterogeneous stoichiometries rather than forming complex(es) of a uniform 1:1:1 stoichiometry as proposed by Ulrich et al. (7Ulrich A. Partridge J.R. Schwartz T.U. The stoichiometry of the nucleoporin 62 subcomplex of the nuclear pore in solution.Mol. Biol.

Hence, the previously detected interactomes (9Solmaz S.R. Chauhan R. Blobel G. Melčák I.

The expression construct for the Nup62(322–525)·Nup54(346–510)·Nup58(239–415) complex from Rattus norvegicus was generated using a polycistronic vector as described by Melčák et al. (16Melčák I. Hoelz A. Blobel G. Structure of Nup58/45 suggests flexible nuclear pore diameter by intermolecular sliding.Science. 2007; 315: 1729-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Briefly, coding sequences of Nup58, Nup54, and Nup62 were cloned in a modular tricistronic vector with a thrombin-cleavable His6 tag at the N terminus of Nup58. The coding sequences of the three genes were separated by an ∼60-bp ribosome-binding site-encoding linker. Protein complex purification was performed as reported earlier (16Melčák I. Hoelz A. Blobel G. Structure of Nup58/45 suggests flexible nuclear pore diameter by intermolecular sliding.Science. 2007; 315: 1729-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), using His6 affinity chromatography (through His-tagged Nup58), followed by thrombin cleavage, anion exchange chromatography, and size-exclusion chromatography. After thrombin cleavage, a peptide sequence (GSHM) from the vector precedes the actual Nup58 sequence. Nup54 mutant H469F/Q473L was also expressed as His6-tagged protein from the pET28a vector and purified as described above. All the experiments were performed at 4 °C unless otherwise specified. Protein concentrations were determined from absorbance at 280 nm using extinction coefficients calculated from the protein sequence with the ProtParam tool from the ExPASy webserver (17Gasteiger E. Hoogland C. Gattiker A. Duvaud S. Wilkins R.M. Appel D.R. Bairoch A. The Proteomics Protocols Handbook. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2005Google Scholar). Secondary structure prediction was performed using PSIPRED (18McGuffin L.J. Bryson K. Jones D.T. The PSIPRED protein structure prediction server.Bioinformatics. 2000; 16: 404-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (2724) Google Scholar). For size-exclusion chromatography analysis, 200 μl of protein sample at the given protein concentration was loaded on a Superdex200 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) that was pre-equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT (buffer A), unless otherwise indicated. The column was calibrated in the same buffer with a gel filtration calibration kit (GE Healthcare) using standards of known molecular weights. Secondary structure content of the complex was estimated by far UV wavelength CD scans. CD data are reported as molar ellipticities [Θ]. α-Helical content of the protein complex was estimated from the CD wavelength scans using the webserver K2D3 (19Louis-Jeune C. Andrade-Navarro M.A. Perez-Iratxeta C. Prediction of protein secondary structure from circular dichroism using theoretically derived spectra.Proteins. 2012; 80: 374-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Purified proteins were subjected to analytical size-exclusion chromatography at 4 °C. The size-exclusion chromatography column (Superdex200 10/300 GL) was connected to multiangle light scattering (MALS) and refractive index detectors (DAWN HELEOS and Optilab rEX, Wyatt Technology). The temperature of the Wyatt detectors was controlled at 4 °C (the entire system was placed in a refrigeration unit kept at 4 °C). Weight-averaged molar masses were determined by MALS as described by Solmaz et al. (9Solmaz S.R. Chauhan R. Blobel G. Melčák I. Molecular architecture of the transport channel of the nuclear pore complex.Cell. 2011; 147: 590-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and averaged from at least two experiments (standard deviations were calculated; representative experiments are shown), using the ASTRA 6.0.2.9 software (Wyatt Technology). The analysis of proteins using native-PAGE was performed in Tris-glycine buffer (pH 8.0) according to the method of Laemmli with minor modifications. Polyacrylamide gels with 10% acrylamide in the separating gel and 4% acrylamide in the stacking gel (acrylamide:bis-acrylamide, 29:1, respectively) were used. The protein samples were mixed with equal volumes of 2× native loading buffer (250 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 35% glycerol). To prevent denaturation of the protein complex, the samples were run at a constant voltage of 20 V at 4 °C for 14 h. The native gel was negatively stained using the GelCode E-zinc reversible staining kit (Pierce). The identified protein bands were cut, washed with deionized water, and dried. Dry gel was crushed by a pipette tip, and the proteins were eluted with 300 μl of buffer containing 250 mm Tris-Cl (pH 6.8) and 0.1% SDS overnight at room temperature. Eluted proteins were concentrated with a 3-kDa cutoff filtration unit (Millipore). Concentrated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining (SilverXpress, Life Technologies) of the SDS-PAGE gel. The MBP-Nup62(322–525)·Nup54(346–510)·Nup58(239–415) complex from R. norvegicus was generated by co-expression of the proteins using a polycistronic vector where N termini of Nup58 and Nup62 were tagged to His6 and maltose-binding protein (MBP) tags, respectively. The MBP-Nup62·Nup54·Nup58 complex was purified through His6 affinity chromatography. The His6 tag of Nup58 was cleaved with thrombin. The sample was dialyzed in buffer A. The purified protein complex was bound to amylose resin (New England Biolabs Inc.) equilibrated with buffer A. The MBP-Nup62·Nup54·Nup58-amylose resin was washed with buffer A and used for subsequent studies. 75 μl of amylose-MBP-Nup62·Nup54·Nup58 resin was incubated in a 0.8-ml centrifuge column (Thermo Scientific), at 4 °C with increasing amounts of wild-type Nup54 (453–494) in a final volume of 375 μl. The mixture was then spun at 1000 × g for 2 min at 4 °C. The amount of Nup58 released from the amylose matrix into the supernatant, as a function of the concentration of wild-type Nup54 (453–494), was calculated through absorbance of the supernatant at 280 nm, after the blank subtraction. 1 mg/ml of trypsin, chymotrypsin, and elastase stock solutions were separately added to 3 mg/ml of the Nup62·Nup54·Nup58 complex in 1:100 (v/v) ratio. Reaction mixtures were incubated at room temperature, and samples were taken out at different time points. Reactions were quenched by adding guanidine hydrochloride to a final concentration of 5 m. The protein fragments generated in the limited proteolysis experiments were identified as intact peptides measured to within 1 atomic mass unit of mass accuracy, by electrospray ionization-ion trap mass spectrometry (Bruker Amazon), after separation by microbore reversed-phase chromatography on a 300 Å pore polystyrene-divinylbenzene column (PLRP-S, Agilent). The channel nups Nup62, Nup54, and Nup58 contain ordered regions of ∼150–200 residues and natively unfolded regions of up to ∼300 residues that are marked by repeating phenylalanine-glycine (FG) motifs. Fig. 1 (A–C) illustrates the boundaries of the predicted ordered region in each of the three channel nups and indicates segmentation of each region into 3–4 predicted α-helical segments of ∼40–80 amino acid residues in length. As indicated (Fig. 1D), the boundaries of the predicted helical segments of each ordered region closely matched the experimental data (9Solmaz S.R. Chauhan R. Blobel G. Melčák I.

This segmentation pattern is highly conserved between uni- and multicellular eukaryotes (Fig. 2). Each of these segments has been traced and assigned to modular structures that build mid-plane rings and their projecting fingers in a model of a reconstructed central channel, in both its dilated and its constricted forms (11Solmaz S.R.

Size-exclusion chromatography of the purified triple complex at increasing concentrations showed a corresponding shift of its broadly eluting peak to earlier elution positions (Fig. 3B) (16Melčák I. Hoelz A. Blobel G. Structure of Nup58/45 suggests flexible nuclear pore diameter by intermolecular sliding.Science. 2007; 315: 1729-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), consistent with dynamic and concentration-dependent mass heterogeneity of the triple complex. We analyzed the complex by circular dichroism spectroscopy to determine its secondary structure content. Wavelength spectra of the triple complex showed no significant difference at various concentrations (0.075–0.6 mg/ml) on the α-helical content of the structure, which was calculated to be about 68% (Fig. 3, C and D). This value closely matched the predicted α-helical content for the complex (Fig. 2). Hence, the observed concentration effects on the elution profile (Fig. 3B) (16Melčák I. Hoelz A. Blobel G. Structure of Nup58/45 suggests flexible nuclear pore diameter by intermolecular sliding.Science. 2007; 315: 1729-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) are not attributable to improper folding of α-helical regions. To assess the range of mass heterogeneity of the broadly eluting peak of the triple complex, we coupled size-exclusion chromatography to MALS analyses to determine molar masses (Fig. 4, A and B). The large range in molar masses exhibited by the entirety of the eluted peak is listed in Fig. 4C. Notably, the molar mass distribution across the peak ranges from 40 to 92 kDa at 2 mg/ml and from 46 to 192 kDa at 5 mg/ml. Within the considerable mass heterogeneity across the elution profile of the triple complex, masses as low as 40–46 kDa (Fig. 4C) were detected in the descending part of the peak. As the theoretical mass of a 1:1:1 triple complex would be ∼64 kDa, the descending part of the peak is made up of two rather than three protein molecules. It should also be noted that in a mixture of heterogeneous assemblies that are in continuous dynamic equilibrium, the individual oligomeric states are not fully separated, and therefore their masses are averaged. Thus, individual assemblies with lower or higher mass may exist. The mass distribution of the ternary complex and its concentration-dependent variability support the observation that the triple complex is heterogeneous and forms multiple oligomeric states. Furthermore, the mass distribution accommodates various structural states expected from our model of the NPC transport channel, and it can be excluded that the complex forms a stable and homogenous 1:1:1 assembly, as suggested previously (7Ulrich A. Partridge J.R. Schwartz T.U. The stoichiometry of the nucleoporin 62 subcomplex of the nuclear pore in solution.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2014; 25: 1484-1492Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To further assess the degree of heterogeneity of the triple complex, we used multidimensional analysis. Aliquots from fractions across the peak eluted from size-exclusion chromatography (Fig. 5A) were first subjected to electrophoresis under native conditions (Fig. 5B), followed by electrophoresis of the resulting resolved fractions under denaturing conditions (SDS) (Fig. 5C). We observed that each of the four analyzed fractions was composed of distinct mixtures of varying composition of the three channel nups. Notably, the amount of Nup58 is variable. For example, one of these four fractions (Fig. 5B) contained primarily Nup62 and Nup54 when analyzed in a second dimension under denaturing conditions (Fig. 5C). When only one-dimensional SDS-PAGE analysis was carried out on fractions across the peak eluted by size-exclusion chromatography (Fig. 5A), the staining intensity for the three components of the triple complex appeared to be consistent with 1:1:1 stoichiometry of Nup62, Nup54, and Nup58 (Fig. 5D), thus camouflaging the dynamic heterogeneity of the triple complex as illustrated in Fig. 5, B and C. To probe the stability of the triple complex, we subjected it to size-exclusion chromatography in the presence of the non-ionic detergent n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside. Strikingly, the Nup58 component of the triple complex was dissociated during size-exclusion chromatography in 65 mm n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside and eluted in later fractions, separated from the peak of complexes containing Nup54 and Nup62 (Fig. 6). These data indicate that Nup58 engages in triple complex formation primarily through hydrophobic interactions, in agreement with our crystal data showing the Nup54·Nup58 interface to be largely hydrophobic in nature (9Solmaz S.R. Chauhan R. Blobel G. Melčák I. Molecular architecture of the transport channel of the nuclear pore complex.Cell. 2011; 147: 590-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In a second approach, we probed the preassembled triple complex in a competition assay with a cognate segment of Nup54 (residues 453–494) as used for determination of the crystal structure of the Nup54·Nup58 interactome (9Solmaz S.R. Chauhan R. Blobel G. Melčák I. Molecular architecture of the transport channel of the nuclear pore complex.Cell. 2011; 147: 590-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). These components were incubated, and the mixture was subjected to size-exclusion chromatography followed by SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 7). Wild-type Nup54 segment pulled Nup58 (comprising the entire ordered region of Nup58) out of the triple complex (Fig. 7B). Competition was quantitated using a matrix-assisted depletion assay (20Pollard T.D. A guide to simple and informative binding assays.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2010; 21: 4061-4067Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) in which amylose resin-bound MBP triple complex was titrated with varying amounts of wild-type Nup54 (453–494). The amount of Nup58 depleted from the matrix was monitored through increase in the absorbance in the solution. Indeed, incubation of the triple complex with increasing concentrations of Nup54 segment pulled out increasing amounts of Nup58 (Fig. 7D). We conclude that Nup58 is anchored to the triple complex primarily via its interaction with a cognate segment of Nup54 (9Solmaz S.R. Chauhan R. Blobel G. Melčák I. Molecular architecture of the transport channel of the nuclear pore complex.Cell. 2011; 147: 590-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and that interactions of other segments of Nup58, if they would contribute to triple complex formation, would be too weak to detect in this assay. Strikingly, a thermostable mutant of the Nup54 segment (11Solmaz S.R. Blobel G. Melčák I. Ring cycle for dilating and constricting the nuclear pore.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 5858-5863Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) where two crucially localized hydrophilic residues were changed to hydrophobic ones (H469F and Q473L) was unable to accomplish an equivalent pullout of Nup58 from the triple complexes (Fig. 7C). Together these data are consistent with the previously identified Nup54·Nup58 interactome (9Solmaz S.R. Chauhan R. Blobel G. Melčák I. Molecular architecture of the transport channel of the nuclear pore complex.Cell. 2011; 147: 590-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) being an indispensable contributor for triple complex formation. In a third approach, we exposed the triple complex to various proteases and identified the resulting fragments by mass spectrometry, with the expectation that interacting regions should be more protected from proteolysis. Strikingly, the location of protease-protected regions of the triple complex roughly coincided with the boundaries of our previously identified and characterized interactomes (9Solmaz S.R. Chauhan R.

To test whether the previously defined interaction domains between the cognate segments (9Solmaz S.R. Chauhan R. Blobel G. Melčák I.

We found an N-terminally truncated region of Nup58 (Fig. 9, B and E), but not its C-terminally truncated counterpart (Fig. 9, C and F), to be sufficient to efficiently co-purify Nup62 and Nup54 (compare with Fig. 9, A and D). Moreover, a truncated Nup54 cognate segment of Nup62, but not an N-terminally truncated counterpart of Nup62, could be co-purified with Nup54 and Nup58 (Fig. 9, G–J). These data confirm that our crystallographically defined Nup54·Nup58 and Nup54·Nup62 hetero-interactomes are indeed crucial for forming the heterogeneous and dynamic assemblies of the triple complex. Here, we report solution studies on a triple complex formed by the ∼150–200-residue-long ordered region of each of the three channel nucleoporins, Nup62, Nup54, and Nup58. We show that recombinant proteins (each representing the entire ordered region of the three channel nups) form a dynamic mixture of heterogeneous complexes. We biophysically and biochemically characterized this triple complex and employed truncated forms or cognate segments of the ordered region for probing assembly and disassembly of the triple complex. We find that our previously identified hetero-interactomes (9Solmaz S.R. Chauhan R. Blobel G. Melčák I. Molecular architecture of the transport channel of the nuclear pore complex.Cell. 2011; 147: 590-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) formed by cognate segments of the ordered region of the three channel nups are indeed also the principal drivers for triple complex assembly in solution. Cognate segments of the ordered region of each of the channel nups have previously been identified and characterized by mapping and atomic resolution crystal structures, which led us to propose a model for the structure and dynamics of the central channel of the nuclear pore (9Solmaz S.R. Chauhan R. Blobel G. Melčák I. Molecular architecture of the transport channel of the nuclear pore complex.Cell. 2011; 147: 590-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 11Solmaz S.R. Blobel G. Melčák I. Ring cycle for dilating and constricting the nuclear pore.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 5858-5863Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Two salient structural features of this model are mid-plane rings and attached triple helices (fingers) that form cytoplasmic and nucleoplasmic entries to the mid-plane rings (Fig. 10). With regard to dynamics, we have proposed a ring cycle model, whereby conformers of a single large (dilated) ring convert to conformers of three small (constricted) rings, reflecting opened and closed states of the central channel of the nuclear pore (Fig. 10), with transport factors suggested to stabilize the open form of the central channel (9Solmaz S.R.

Melčák I. Ring cycle for dilating and constricting the nuclear pore.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 5858-5863Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Indeed, a recent study yielded data in support of the proposed regulation of the central transport channel. Transport factor binding to the Nup58 segment (extended C-terminally to contain the requisite phenylalanine-glycine repeat binding site for the transport factor) was shown to allosterically stabilize dilated Nup54·Nup58 conformers, at the expense of their constricted counterparts (21Koh J. Blobel G. Allosteric regulation in gating the central channel of the nuclear pore complex.Cell. 2015; 161: 1361-1373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Collectively, our studies led to crystal structure-informed copy numbers of 128, 64, and 32 molecules of Nup62, Nup54, and Nup58, respectively, amounting to a mass of 12.3 MDa for the central channel, roughly 10% of the estimated mass of the entire NPC (9Solmaz S.R. Chauhan R. Blobel G. Melčák I. Molecular architecture of the transport channel of the nuclear pore complex.Cell. 2011; 147: 590-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Our model also suggests that the hitherto unassigned segments of the ordered regions of the three channel nups provide binding sites for neighboring nups. Specifically, a segment located in the N-terminal part of the ordered region of Nup58 was proposed to anchor mid-plane rings to neighboring nucleoporins, and a C-terminal segment of the ordered region of Nup62 was proposed to link the base of the fingers to a neighboring nucleoporin. Although structural information for interactions of channel nups with neighboring nups is still missing, there is biochemical evidence for this arrangement (22Grandi P. Schlaich N. Tekotte H. Hurt E.C.

Hence, the path of segments of the ordered regions of each of the three channel nucleoporins has been tentatively traced (11Solmaz S.R. Blobel G. Melčák I.

Of the three channel nups, Nup54 stands out as it provides two cognate segments, one for forming the mid-plane ring and the other for forming the fingers, respectively, whereas only one segment each of Nup62 and two adjacent segments of Nup58 (Fig. 1D) contribute to the finger and mid-plane elements of the central channel. Notably, the structure-informed stoichiometry of 4:2:1 for Nup62, Nup54, and Nup58 has been supported by in vivo quantitative fluorescence intensity data from the fission yeast where endogenous nups were genomically replaced with their GFP-tagged versions (24Asakawa H.

Accordingly, the hitherto “unsaturated” segments of Nup58 and Nup62 that potentially link the structural elements of the central channel to neighboring nucleoporins do not participate in assembly or in disassembly of the triple complex.

https://openalex.org/W1668236065,"Sugars produced from photosynthesis in leaves are transported through the phloem tissues within veins and delivered to non-photosynthetic organs, such as roots, stems, flowers, and seeds, to support their growth and/or storage of carbohydrates. However, because the phloem is located internally within the veins, it is difficult to access and to study the dynamics of sugar transport. Radioactive tracers have been extensively used to study vascular transport in plants and have provided great insights into transport dynamics. To better study sucrose partitioning in vivo, a novel radioactive analog of sucrose was synthesized through a completely chemical synthesis route by substituting fluorine-18 (half-life 110 min) at the 6' position to generate 6'-deoxy-6'[(18)F]fluorosucrose ((18)FS). This radiotracer was then used to compare sucrose transport between wild-type maize plants and mutant plants lacking the Sucrose transporter1 (Sut1) gene, which has been shown to function in sucrose phloem loading. Our results demonstrate that (18)FS is transported in vivo, with the wild-type plants showing a greater rate of transport down the leaf blade than the sut1 mutant plants. A similar transport pattern was also observed for universally labeled [U-(14)C]sucrose ([U-(14)C]suc). Our findings support the proposed sucrose phloem loading function of the Sut1 gene in maize, and additionally demonstrate that the (18)FS analog is a valuable, new tool that offers imaging advantages over [U-(14)C]suc for studying phloem transport in plants."

We report that PS1-induced apoptosis was associated with cellular FLICE-like inhibitory protein (c-FLIP) turnover and that γ-secretase inhibitor blocked c-FLIP turnover and also partially blocked PS1-induced apoptosis. A complete inhibition of PS1-induced apoptosis was achieved by knockdown of PS1-associated protein (PSAP), a mitochondrial proapoptotic protein that forms a complex with Bax upon induction of apoptosis, in the presence of γ-secretase inhibitor.

However, knockdown of Bax or overexpression of Bcl-2 resulted in complete inhibition of PS1-induced apoptosis. These data suggest that PS1 induces apoptosis through two pathways: the γ-secretase-dependent pathway mediated by turnover of c-FLIP and the γ-secretase-independent pathway mediated by PSAP-Bax complex formation. These two pathways converge on Bax to activate mitochondria-dependent apoptosis. These findings provide new insight into the mechanisms by which PS1 is involved in apoptosis and the mechanism by which PS1 exerts its pathogenic effects.

https://openalex.org/W1590946090,"Background A drug-induced apoptosis assay has been developed to determine which chemotherapy drugs or regimens can produce higher cell killing in vitro. This study was done to determine if this assay could be performed in patients with recurrent or metastatic breast cancer patients, to characterize the patterns of drug-induced apoptosis, and to evaluate the clinical utility of the assay. A secondary goal was to correlate assay use with clinical outcomes. Methods In a prospective, non-blinded, multi institutional controlled trial, 30 evaluable patients with recurrent or metastatic breast cancer who were treated with chemotherapy had tumor samples submitted for the MiCK drug-induced apoptosis assay. After receiving results within 72 hours after biopsy, physicians could use the test to determine therapy (users), or elect to not use the test (non-users). Results The assay was able to characterize drug-induced apoptosis in tumor specimens from breast cancer patients and identified which drugs or combinations gave highest levels of apoptosis. Patterns of drug activity were also analyzed in triple negative breast cancer. Different drugs from a single class of agents often produced significantly different amounts of apoptosis. Physician frequently (73%) used the assay to help select chemotherapy treatments in patients, Patients whose physicians were users had a higher response (CR+PR) rate compared to non-users (38.1% vs 0%, p = 0.04) and a higher disease control (CR+PR+Stable) rate (81% vs 25%, p<0.01). Time to relapse was longer in users 7.4 mo compared to non-users 2.2 mo (p<0.01). Conclusions The MiCK assay can be performed in breast cancer specimens, and results are often used by physicians in breast cancer patients with recurrent or metastatic disease. These results from a good laboratory phase II study can be the basis for a future larger prospective multicenter study to more definitively establish the value of the assay.

https://openalex.org/W352619735,"Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common psychiatric disorder in children and adolescents. Immediate-release methylphenidate (IR-MPH) is the medical treatment of first choice. The necessity to use several IR-MPH tablets per day and associated potential social stigma at school often leads to reduced compliance, sub-optimal treatment, and therefore economic loss. Replacement of IR-MPH with a single-dose extended release (ER-MPH) formulation may improve drug response and economic efficiency.To evaluate the cost-effectiveness from a societal perspective of a switch from IR-MPH to ER-MPH in patients who are sub-optimally treated.A daily Markov-cycle model covering a time-span of 10 years was developed including four different health states: (1) optimal response, (2) sub-optimal response, (3) discontinued treatment, and (4) natural remission. ER-MPH options included methylphenidate osmotic release oral system (MPH-OROS) and Equasym XL/Medikinet CR. Both direct costs and indirect costs were included in the analysis, and effects were expressed as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Univariate, multivariate as well as probabilistic sensitivity analysis were conducted and the main outcomes were incremental cost-effectiveness ratios.Switching sub-optimally treated patients from IR-MPH to MPH-OROS or Equasym XL/Medikinet CR led to per-patient cost-savings of €4200 and €5400, respectively, over a 10-year treatment span. Sensitivity analysis with plausible variations of input parameters resulted in cost-savings in the vast majority of estimations.This study lends economic support to switching patients with ADHD with suboptimal response to short-acting IR-MPH to long-acting ER-MPH regimens."
https://openalex.org/W429222910,"The aims of this study were to compare the steadiness index of spinal regions during single-leg standing in older adults with and without chronic low back pain (LBP) and to correlate measurements of steadiness index with the performance of clinical balance tests. Thirteen community-dwelling older adults (aged 55 years or above) with chronic LBP and 13 age- and gender-matched asymptomatic volunteers participated in this study. Data collection was conducted in a university research laboratory. Measurements were steadiness index of spinal regions (trunk, thoracic spine, lumbar spine, and pelvis) during single-leg standing including relative holding time (RHT) and relative standstill time (RST), and clinical balance tests (timed up and go test and 5-repetition sit to stand test). The LBP group had a statistically significantly smaller RHT than the control group, regardless of one leg stance on the painful or non-painful sides. The RSTs on the painful side leg in the LBP group were not statistically significantly different from the average RSTs of both legs in the control group; however, the RSTs on the non-painful side leg in the LBP group were statistically significantly smaller than those in the control group for the trunk, thoracic spine, and lumbar spine. No statistically significant intra-group differences were found in the RHTs and RSTs between the painful and non-painful side legs in the LBP group. Measurements of clinical balance tests also showed insignificant weak to moderate correlations with steadiness index. In conclusion, older adults with chronic LBP demonstrated decreased spinal steadiness not only in the symptomatic lumbar spine but also in the other spinal regions within the kinetic chain of the spine. When treating older adults with chronic LBP, clinicians may also need to examine their balance performance and spinal steadiness during balance challenging tests."
https://openalex.org/W379695237,"Upon absorption of light, the retinal chromophore in rhodopsin isomerizes from the 11-cis to the trans configuration, initiating a photoreaction cycle. The primary photoreaction state, bathorhodopsin (BATHO), relaxes thermally through lumirhodopsin (LUMI) into a photoactive state, metarhodopsin (META), which stimulates the conjugated G-protein. Previous crystallographic studies of squid and bovine rhodopsins have shown that the structural change in the primary photoreaction of squid rhodopsin is considerably different from that observed in bovine rhodopsin. It would be expected that there is a fundamental difference in the subsequent thermal relaxation process between vertebrate and invertebrate rhodopsins. In this work, we performed crystallographic analyses of the LUMI state of squid rhodopsin using the P62 crystal. When the crystal was illuminated at 100 K with blue light, a half fraction of the protein was converted into BATHO. This reaction state relaxed into LUMI when the illuminated crystal was warmed in the dark to 170 K. It was found that, whereas trans retinal is largely twisted in BATHO, it takes on a more planar configuration in LUMI. This relaxation of retinal is accompanied by reorientation of the Schiff base NH bond, the hydrogen-bonding partner of which is switched to Asn185 in LUMI. Unlike bovine rhodopsin, the BATHO-to-LUMI transition in squid rhodopsin was accompanied by no significant change in the position/orientation of the beta-ionone ring of retinal."
https://openalex.org/W365278753,"Ankyrin-G is an adaptor protein that links membrane proteins to the underlying cytoskeletal network. Alternative splicing of the Ank3 gene gives rise to multiple ankyrin-G isoforms in numerous tissues. To date, only one ankyrin-G isoform has been characterized in heart and transcriptional regulation of the Ank3 gene is completely unknown. In this study, we describe the first comprehensive analysis of Ank3 expression in heart. Using a PCR-based screen of cardiac mRNA transcripts, we identify two new exons and 28 alternative splice variants of the Ank3 gene. We measure the relative expression of each splice variant using quantitative real-time PCR and exon-exon boundary spanning primers that specifically amplify individual Ank3 variants. Six variants are rarely expressed (<1%), while the remaining variants display similar expression patterns in three hearts. Of the five first exons in the Ank3 gene, exon 1d is only expressed in heart and skeletal muscle as it was not detected in brain, kidney, cerebellum, and lung. Immunoblot analysis reveals multiple ankyrin-G isoforms in heart, and two ankyrin-G subpopulations are detected in adult cardiomyocytes by immunofluorescence. One population co-localizes with the voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.5 at the intercalated disc, while the other population expresses at the Z-line. Two of the rare splice variants excise a portion of the ZU5 motif, which encodes the minimal spectrin-binding domain, and these variants lack β-spectrin binding. Together, these data demonstrate that Ank3 is subject to complex splicing regulation resulting in a diverse population of ankyrin-G isoforms in heart."
https://openalex.org/W618493723,"In a competitive sport, the outcome of a game is determined by an athlete's relationship with an unpredictable and uncontrolled opponent. We have previously analyzed the preparatory state of ground reaction forces (GRFs) dividing non-weighted and weighted states (i.e., vertical GRFs below and above 120% of body weight, respectively) in a competitive ballgame task and demonstrated that the non-weighted state prevented delay of the defensive step and promoted successful guarding. However, the associated kinetics of lower extremity joints during a competitive sports task remains unknown. The present study aims to investigate the kinetic characteristics of a real-time competitive sport before movement initiation. As a first kinetic study on a competitive sport, we initially compared the successful defensive kinetics with a relatively stable preparatory state and the choice-reaction sidestep as a control movement. Then, we investigated the kinetic cause of the outcome in a 1-on-1 dribble in terms of the preparatory states according to our previous study. The results demonstrated that in successful defensive motions in the non-weighted state guarding trial, the times required for the generation of hip abduction and three extension torques for the hip, knee, and ankle joints were significantly shortened compared with the choice-reaction sidestep, and hip abduction and hip extension torques were produced almost simultaneously. The sport-specific movement kinetics emerges only in a more-realistic interactive experimental setting. A comparison of the outcomes in the 1-on-1 dribble and preparatory GRF states showed that, in the non-weighted state, the defenders guarded successfully in 68.0% of the trials, and the defender's initiation time was earlier than that in the weighted state (39.1%). In terms of kinetics, the root mean squares of the derivative of hip abduction and three extension torques in the non-weighted state were smaller than those in the weighted state, irrespective of the outcome. These results indicate that the preparatory body state as explained by short-term joint torque fluctuations before the defensive step would help explain the performance in competitive sports, and will give insights into understanding human adaptive behavior in unpredicted and uncontrolled environments."
https://openalex.org/W1827628940,"There is evidence that stem cells and their progeny play a role in the development of the prostate. Although stem cells are also considered to give rise to differentiated progeny in the adult prostate epithelium ex vivo, the cohort of adult prostate stem cells in vivo as well as the mechanisms by which the adult prostate epithelium is maintained and regenerated remain highly controversial. We have attempted to resolve this conundrum by performing in vivo tracing of serially replicating cells after the sequential administration of two thymidine analogues to mice. Our results show that, during normal prostate homeostasis, sequentially proliferating cells are detected at a rate that is consistent with a stochastic process. These findings indicate that in vivo, under steady-state conditions, most adult prostate epithelial cells do not represent the progeny of a small number of specialized progenitors that generate sequentially replicating transit-amplifying (TA) cells but are formed by stochastic cell division. Similarly, no rapidly cycling TA cells were detected during regeneration following one cycle of androgen-mediated involution/regeneration of the prostate epithelium. These findings greatly enhance our understanding of the mechanisms regulating prostate epithelial cell renewal and may have significant implications in defining the cell of origin of proliferative prostatic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2214652090,"Background In patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis (HD), increased levels of circulating fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23) are independently associated with cardiovascular events and mortality. Interventional strategies aiming to reduce levels of FGF-23 in HD patients are of particular interest. The purpose of the current study was to compare the impact of high-flux versus low-flux HD on circulating FGF-23 levels. Methods We conducted a post-hoc analysis of the MINOXIS study, including 127 dialysis patients randomized to low-flux (n = 62) and high-flux (n = 65) HD for 52 weeks. Patients with valid measures for FGF-23 investigated baseline and after 52 weeks were included. Results Compared to baseline, a significant increase in FGF-23 levels after one year of low-flux HD was observed (Delta plasma FGF-23: +4026 RU/ml; p < 0.001). In contrast, FGF-23 levels remained stable in the high flux group (Delta plasma FGF-23: +373 RU/ml, p = 0.70). The adjusted difference of the absolute change in FGF-23 levels between the two treatment groups was statistically significant (p < 0.01). Conclusions Over a period of 12 months, high-flux HD was associated with stable FGF-23 levels, whereas the low-flux HD group showed an increase of FGF-23. However, the implications of the different FGF 23 time-trends in patients on high flux dialysis, as compared to the control group, remain to be explored in specifically designed clinical trials.

https://openalex.org/W1482987114,"Hematopoietic regeneration after high dose chemotherapy necessitates activation of the stem cell pool. There is evidence that serum taken after chemotherapy comprises factors stimulating proliferation and self-renewal of CD34(+) hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs)--however, the nature of these feedback signals is yet unclear. Here, we addressed the question if specific microRNAs (miRNAs) or metabolites are affected after high dose chemotherapy. Serum taken from the same patients before and after chemotherapy was supplemented for in vitro cultivation of HSPCs. Serum taken after chemotherapy significantly enhanced HSPC proliferation, better maintained a CD34(+) immunophenotype, and stimulated colony forming units. Microarray analysis revealed that 23 miRNAs changed in serum after chemotherapy--particularly, miRNA-320c and miRNA-1275 were down-regulated whereas miRNA-3663-3p was up-regulated. miRNA-320c was exemplarily inhibited by an antagomiR, which seemed to increase proliferation. Metabolomic profiling demonstrated that 44 metabolites were less abundant, whereas three (including 2-hydroxybutyrate and taurocholenate sulphate) increased in serum upon chemotherapy. Nine of these metabolites were subsequently tested for effects on HSPCs in vitro, but none of them exerted a clear concentration dependent effect on proliferation, immunophenotype and colony forming unit formation. Taken together, serum profiles of miRNAs and metabolites changed after chemotherapy. Rather than individually, these factors may act in concert to recruit HSPCs into action for hematopoietic regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W609900198,"A growing number of studies have begun to assess how the actions of one individual are represented in an observer. Using a variant of an action observation paradigm, four experiments examined whether one person's behaviour can influence the subjective decisions and judgements of another. In Experiment 1, two observers sat adjacent to each other and took turns to freely select and reach to one of two locations. Results showed that participants were less likely to make a response to the same location as their partner. In three further experiments observers were asked to decide which of two familiar products they preferred or which of two faces were most attractive. Results showed that participants were less likely to choose the product or face occupying the location of their partner's previous reaching response. These findings suggest that action observation can influence a range of free choice preferences and decisions. Possible mechanisms through which this influence occurs are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1517347043,"The PI3K/Akt pathway is central for numerous cellular functions and is frequently deregulated in human cancers. The catalytic subunits of PI3K, p110, are thought to have a potential oncogenic function, and the regulatory subunit p85 exerts tumor suppressor properties. The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, is a highly suitable system to investigate PI3K signaling, expressing one catalytic, Dp110, and one regulatory subunit, Dp60, and both show strong homology with the human PI3K proteins p110 and p85. We recently showed that p37δ, an alternatively spliced product of human PI3K p110δ, displayed strong proliferation-promoting properties despite lacking the catalytic domain completely. Here we functionally evaluate the different domains of human p37δ in Drosophila. The N-terminal region of Dp110 alone promotes cell proliferation, and we show that the unique C-terminal region of human p37δ further enhances these proliferative properties, both when expressed in Drosophila, and in human HEK-293 cells. Surprisingly, although the N-terminal region of Dp110 and the C-terminal region of p37δ both display proliferative effects, over-expression of full length Dp110 or the N-terminal part of Dp110 decreases survival in Drosophila, whereas the unique C-terminal region of p37δ prevents this effect. Furthermore, we found that the N-terminal region of the catalytic subunit of PI3K p110, including only the Dp60 (p85)-binding domain and a minor part of the Ras binding domain, rescues phenotypes with severely impaired development caused by Dp60 over-expression in Drosophila, possibly by regulating the levels of Dp60, and also by increasing the levels of phosphorylated Akt.

Here, we fully describe all the steps to isolate transcriptionally active nuclei from C. roseus leaves and utilize them to perform nuclear run-on transcription assay. Nuclei isolated by this method transcribed at a level consistent with their response to external stimuli, as transcription rate of TDC gene was found to be higher in response to external stimuli i.e. when seedlings were subjected to UV-B light or to methyl jasmonate (MeJA). However, the relative transcript abundance measured parallel through qRT-PCR was found to be inconsistent with the synthesis rate indicating that some post transcriptional events might have a role in transcript stability in response to stimuli.Our study provides an optimized, efficient and inexpensive method of isolation of intact nuclei and nuclear 'run-on' transcription assay to carry out in-situ measurement of gene transcription rate in Catharanthus roseus. This would be valuable in investigating the transcriptional and post transcriptional response of other TIA pathway genes in C. roseus. Isolated nuclei may also provide a resource that could be used for performing the chip assay as well as serve as the source of nuclear proteins for in-vitro EMSA studies.
