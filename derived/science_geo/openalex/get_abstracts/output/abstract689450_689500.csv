https://openalex.org/W4214940159,"The sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor empagliflozin reduces the risk of cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization in patients with chronic heart failure, but whether empagliflozin also improves clinical outcomes when initiated in patients who are hospitalized for acute heart failure is unknown. In this double-blind trial (EMPULSE; NCT04157751 ), 530 patients with a primary diagnosis of acute de novo or decompensated chronic heart failure regardless of left ventricular ejection fraction were randomly assigned to receive empagliflozin 10 mg once daily or placebo. Patients were randomized in-hospital when clinically stable (median time from hospital admission to randomization, 3 days) and were treated for up to 90 days. The primary outcome of the trial was clinical benefit, defined as a hierarchical composite of death from any cause, number of heart failure events and time to first heart failure event, or a 5 point or greater difference in change from baseline in the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Total Symptom Score at 90 days, as assessed using a win ratio. More patients treated with empagliflozin had clinical benefit compared with placebo (stratified win ratio, 1.36; 95% confidence interval, 1.09-1.68; P = 0.0054), meeting the primary endpoint. Clinical benefit was observed for both acute de novo and decompensated chronic heart failure and was observed regardless of ejection fraction or the presence or absence of diabetes. Empagliflozin was well tolerated; serious adverse events were reported in 32.3% and 43.6% of the empagliflozin- and placebo-treated patients, respectively. These findings indicate that initiation of empagliflozin in patients hospitalized for acute heart failure is well tolerated and results in significant clinical benefit in the 90 days after starting treatment."
https://openalex.org/W4214706689,"Abstract Previous studies have suggested that the gut microbiome influences the response to checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs) in patients with cancer. CBM588 is a bifidogenic live bacterial product that we postulated could augment CPI response through modulation of the gut microbiome. In this open-label, single-center study (NCT03829111), 30 treatment-naive patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma with clear cell and/or sarcomatoid histology and intermediate- or poor-risk disease were randomized 2:1 to receive nivolumab and ipilimumab with or without daily oral CBM588, respectively. Stool metagenomic sequencing was performed at multiple timepoints. The primary endpoint to compare the relative abundance of Bifidobacterium spp. at baseline and at 12 weeks was not met, and no significant differences in Bifidobacterium spp. or Shannon index associated with the addition of CBM588 to nivolumab–ipilimumab were detected. Secondary endpoints included response rate, progression-free survival (PFS) and toxicity. PFS was significantly longer in patients receiving nivolumab–ipilimumab with CBM588 than without (12.7 months versus 2.5 months, hazard ratio 0.15, 95% confidence interval 0.05–0.47, P = 0.001). Although not statistically significant, the response rate was also higher in patients receiving CBM588 (58% versus 20%, P = 0.06). No significant difference in toxicity was observed between the study arms. The data suggest that CBM588 appears to enhance the clinical outcome in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma treated with nivolumab–ipilimumab. Larger studies are warranted to confirm this clinical observation and elucidate the mechanism of action and the effects on microbiome and immune compartments."
https://openalex.org/W4214673864,"The composition of the gut microbiome has been associated with clinical responses to immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatment, but there is limited consensus on the specific microbiome characteristics linked to the clinical benefits of ICIs. We performed shotgun metagenomic sequencing of stool samples collected before ICI initiation from five observational cohorts recruiting ICI-naive patients with advanced cutaneous melanoma (n = 165). Integrating the dataset with 147 metagenomic samples from previously published studies, we found that the gut microbiome has a relevant, but cohort-dependent, association with the response to ICIs. A machine learning analysis confirmed the link between the microbiome and overall response rates (ORRs) and progression-free survival (PFS) with ICIs but also revealed limited reproducibility of microbiome-based signatures across cohorts. Accordingly, a panel of species, including Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, Roseburia spp. and Akkermansia muciniphila, associated with responders was identified, but no single species could be regarded as a fully consistent biomarker across studies. Overall, the role of the human gut microbiome in ICI response appears more complex than previously thought, extending beyond differing microbial species simply present or absent in responders and nonresponders. Future studies should adopt larger sample sizes and take into account the complex interplay of clinical factors with the gut microbiome over the treatment course."
https://openalex.org/W4214735462,"The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant exhibits striking immune evasion and is spreading rapidly worldwide. Understanding the structural basis of the high transmissibility and enhanced immune evasion of Omicron is of high importance. Here, using cryo-electron microscopy, we present both the closed and the open states of the Omicron spike (S) protein, which appear more compact than the counterparts of the G614 strain1, potentially related to enhanced inter-protomer and S1-S2 interactions induced by Omicron residue substitution. The closed state showing dominant population may indicate a conformational masking mechanism for the immune evasion of Omicron. Moreover, we captured three states for the Omicron S-ACE2 complex, revealing that the substitutions on the Omicron RBM result in new salt bridges and hydrogen bonds, more favourable electrostatic surface properties, and an overall strengthened S-ACE2 interaction, in line with the observed higher ACE2 affinity of Omicron S than of G614. Furthermore, we determined the structures of Omicron S in complex with the Fab of S3H3, an antibody that is able to cross-neutralize major variants of concern including Omicron, elucidating the structural basis for S3H3-mediated broad-spectrum neutralization. Our findings shed light on the receptor engagement and antibody neutralization or evasion of Omicron and may also inform the design of broadly effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2."
https://openalex.org/W4214512384,"Abstract Large traditional clinical trials suggest that sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors improve symptoms in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and in patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). In the midst of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic, we sought to confirm these benefits in a new type of trial that was patient centered and conducted in a completely remote fashion. In the CHIEF-HF trial ( NCT04252287 ), 476 participants with HF, regardless of EF or diabetes status, were randomized to 100 mg of canagliflozin or placebo. Enrollment was stopped early due to shifting sponsor priorities, without unblinding. The primary outcome was change in the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Total Symptom Score (KCCQ TSS) at 12 weeks. The 12-week change in KCCQ TSS was 4.3 points (95% confidence interval, 0.8–7.8; P = 0.016) higher with canagliflozin than with placebo, meeting the primary endpoint. Similar effects were observed in participants with HFpEF and in those with HFrEF and in participants with and without diabetes, demonstrating that canagliflozin significantly improves symptom burden in HF, regardless of EF or diabetes status. This randomized, double-blind trial, conducted without in-person interactions between doctor and patient, can serve as a model for future all-virtual clinical trials."

https://openalex.org/W4214544930,"As the biomedical community produces datasets that are increasingly complex and high dimensional, there is a need for more sophisticated computational tools to extract biological insights. We present Multiscale PHATE, a method that sweeps through all levels of data granularity to learn abstracted biological features directly predictive of disease outcome. Built on a coarse-graining process called diffusion condensation, Multiscale PHATE learns a data topology that can be analyzed at coarse resolutions for high-level summarizations of data and at fine resolutions for detailed representations of subsets. We apply Multiscale PHATE to a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) dataset with 54 million cells from 168 hospitalized patients and find that patients who die show CD16hiCD66blo neutrophil and IFN-γ+ granzyme B+ Th17 cell responses. We also show that population groupings from Multiscale PHATE directly fed into a classifier predict disease outcome more accurately than naive featurizations of the data. Multiscale PHATE is broadly generalizable to different data types, including flow cytometry, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), single-cell sequencing assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (scATAC-seq), and clinical variables."

https://openalex.org/W4214738445,"Cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) is a therapeutically relevant drug target for controlling pain, obesity, and other central nervous system disorders. However, full agonists and antagonists of CB1 have been reported to cause serious side effects in patients. Therefore, partial agonists have emerged as a viable alternative as they can mitigate overstimulation and side effects. One of the key bottlenecks in the design of partial agonists, however, is the lack of understanding of the molecular mechanism of partial agonism itself. In this study, we examine two mechanistic hypotheses for the origin of partial agonism in cannabinoid receptors and predict the mechanistic basis of partial agonism exhibited by Δ9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) against CB1. In particular, we inspect whether partial agonism emerges from the ability of THC to bind in both agonist and antagonist-binding poses or from its ability to only partially activate the receptor. We used extensive molecular dynamics simulations and Markov state modeling to capture the THC binding in both antagonist and agonist-binding poses in the CB1 receptor. Furthermore, we predict that binding of THC in the agonist-binding pose leads to rotation of toggle switch residues and causes partial outward movement of intracellular transmembrane helix 6 (TM6). Our simulations also suggest that the alkyl side chain of THC plays a crucial role in determining partial agonism by stabilizing the ligand in the agonist and antagonist-like poses within the pocket. Taken together, this study provides important insights into the mechanistic origin of the partial agonism of THC."
https://openalex.org/W4214836700,"Bosnia and Herzegovina is among ten countries in the world with the highest mortality rate due to COVID-19. Lack of lockdown, open borders, high mortality rate, no vaccination plan, and strong domestic anti-vaccination movement present serious COVID-19 concerns in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In such circumstances, we set out to study 1) the willingness of general public to receive the vaccine, 2) factors that affect vaccine rejection, and 3) motivation for vaccine acceptance.A cross-sectional study was conducted among 10471 adults in Bosnia and Herzegovina to assess the acceptance or rejection of participants toward COVID-19 vaccination. Using a logistic regression model, we examined the associations of sociodemographic characteristics with vaccine rejection, reasons for vaccine hesitancy, preferred vaccine manufacturer, and information sources.Surprisingly, only 25.7% of respondents indicated they would like to get a COVID-19 vaccine, while 74.3% of respondents were either hesitant or completely rejected vaccination. The vaccine acceptance increased with increasing age, education, and income level. Major motivation of pro-vaccination behavior was intention to achieve collective immunity (30.1%), while the leading incentive for vaccine refusal was deficiency of clinical data (30.2%). The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is shown to be eightfold more preferred vaccine compared to the other manufacturers. For the first time in Bosnia, vaccine acceptance among health care professionals has been reported, where only 39.4% of healthcare professionals expressed willingness to get vaccinated.With the high share of the population unwilling to vaccinate, governmental impotence in securing the vaccines supplies, combined with the lack of any lockdown measures suggests that Bosnia and Herzegovina is unlikely to put COVID-19 pandemic under control in near future."
https://openalex.org/W4214730142,"Humans race drones faster than neural networks trained for end-to-end autonomous flight. This may be related to the ability of human pilots to select task-relevant visual information effectively. This work investigates whether neural networks capable of imitating human eye gaze behavior and attention can improve neural networks' performance for the challenging task of vision-based autonomous drone racing. We hypothesize that gaze-based attention prediction can be an efficient mechanism for visual information selection and decision making in a simulator-based drone racing task. We test this hypothesis using eye gaze and flight trajectory data from 18 human drone pilots to train a visual attention prediction model. We then use this visual attention prediction model to train an end-to-end controller for vision-based autonomous drone racing using imitation learning. We compare the drone racing performance of the attention-prediction controller to those using raw image inputs and image-based abstractions (i.e., feature tracks). Comparing success rates for completing a challenging race track by autonomous flight, our results show that the attention-prediction based controller (88% success rate) outperforms the RGB-image (61% success rate) and feature-tracks (55% success rate) controller baselines. Furthermore, visual attention-prediction and feature-track based models showed better generalization performance than image-based models when evaluated on hold-out reference trajectories. Our results demonstrate that human visual attention prediction improves the performance of autonomous vision-based drone racing agents and provides an essential step towards vision-based, fast, and agile autonomous flight that eventually can reach and even exceed human performances."
https://openalex.org/W4214491534,"Microfinance Institutions provide financial services to low-income clients and the poor who are excluded from formal financial institutions. Hence, the sustainability of microfinance institutions (MFIs) remains essential. This study examines the relationship between social and financial performance and whether there is a trade-off between both objectives after the 2008 global financial crisis. The study used 735 observations from 105 Microfinance Institutions across 26 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa from 2011 to 2017 and employed the Generalized Method of Moment and Seeming Unrelated Regression for the analyses. The results indicate that increasing the number of customers [breadth of outreach increased the financial performance (return on equity)]. The result also showed that the Percentage of Female Borrowers contributes to the sustainability of Microfinance Institutions due to their higher loan repayment rate than males. In addition, our results document a trade-off between the Depth of Outreach and Operational Self-Sustainability among Microfinance Institutions. The study recommends the following: 1) Microfinance institutions should purposefully increase credit facilities extended to female borrowers since that will make them sustainable. 2) Governments in Sub-Saharan African countries should provide increased financial support in the form of subsidies and tax holidays to Microfinance Institutions operating in very deprived areas, and 3) Management of Microfinance institutions on the continent should regularly re-train and upgrade their staff capacity to effectively assess and manage customers before and after extending credit to them to sustain the industry."
https://openalex.org/W4214656778,"Tuberculosis (TB) is a disease associated with poverty. Moreover, a significant proportion of TB patients face a substantial financial burden before and during TB care. One of the top targets in the End TB strategy was to achieve zero catastrophic costs due to TB by 2020. To assess patient costs related to TB care and the proportion of TB-affected households that faced catastrophic costs, the Philippines National TB Programme (NTP) conducted a national TB patient cost survey in 2016-2017.A cross-sectional survey of 1,912 TB patients taking treatment in health facilities engaged with the NTP. The sample consists of 786 drug-sensitive TB (DS-TB) patients in urban facilities, 806 DS-TB patients in rural facilities, and 320 drug-resistant TB (DR-TB) patients. Catastrophic cost due to TB is defined as total costs, consisting of direct medical and non-medical costs and indirect costs net of social assistance, exceeding 20% of annual household income.The overall mean total cost including pre- and post-diagnostic costs was US$601. The mean total cost was five times higher among DR-TB patients than DS-TB patients. Direct non-medical costs and income loss accounted for 42.7% and 40.4% of the total cost of TB, respectively. More than 40% of households had to rely on dissaving, taking loans, or selling their assets to cope with the costs. Overall, 42.4% (95% confidence interval (95% CI): 40.2-44.6) of TB-affected households faced catastrophic costs due to TB, and it was significantly higher among DR-TB patients (89.7%, 95%CI: 86.3-93.0). A TB enabler package, which 70% of DR-TB patients received, reduced catastrophic costs by 13.1 percentage points (89.7% to 76.6%) among DR-TB patients, but only by 0.4 percentage points (42.4% to 42.0%), overall.TB patients in the Philippines face a substantial financial burden due to TB despite free TB services provided by the National TB Programme. The TB enabler package mitigated catastrophic costs to some extent, but only for DR-TB patients. Enhancing the current social and welfare support through multisectoral collaboration is urgently required to achieve zero catastrophic costs due to TB."
https://openalex.org/W4214708310,"The aim of this research was to systematically investigate the effects of endothelial mesenchymal transition (EndMT) induced by hypoxia on the skin microvascular remodeling of systemic sclerosis (SSc) and the underlying mechanism.Skin tissues from SSc patients and controls were collected for isobaric tags for the relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ)-based proteomics and immunohistochemical test. Human microvascular endothelial cell line-1 (HMEC-1) cultured in hypoxic or normal conditions was treated by tamoxifen or bevacizumab.The iTRAQ-based proteomics indicated a significantly upregulated hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) signal in SSc samples. The immunohistochemical results demonstrated the significant downregulation of CD31, the positive staining of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), HIF-1α, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-a) in SSc skin tissues, compared with control samples. Consistent with these observations, HMEC-1 cells cultured under hypoxic conditions exhibited a significant decrease in CD31 and VE-cadherin expression, alongside a marked increase in the expression of α-SMA and fibronectin, as well as a distinct upregulation of HIF-1α and VEGF-a, when compared with those under normal conditions. It is noteworthy that the inhibition of HIF-1α by tamoxifen effectively downregulated the hypoxic induction of VEGF-a and α-SMA while rescuing the hypoxic suppression of CD31. In addition, the VEGF-a inhibitor bevacizumab treatment had the same effect on the hypoxic expression of α-SMA and CD31, as a tamoxifen intervention, but did not reduce HIF-1α.These results suggest that the HIF-1α/VEGF signaling pathway can have a critical role in mediating the effect of hypoxia-induced EndMT on the skin microvascular remodeling of SSc."
https://openalex.org/W4220959026,"Epidermal tissues play vital roles in maintaining homeostasis and preventing the dysregulation of the cutaneous barrier. Sphingomyelin (SM), a sphingolipid synthesized by sphingomyelin synthase (SMS) 1 and 2, is involved in signal transduction via modulation of lipid-raft functions. Though the implications of SMS on inflammatory diseases have been reported, its role in dermatitis has not been clarified. In this study, we investigated the role of SM in the cutaneous barrier using a dermatitis model established by employing Sgms1 and 2 deficient mice. SM deficiency impaired the cutaneous inflammation and upregulated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation in epithelial tissues. Furthermore, using mouse embryonic fibroblast cells, the sensitivity of STAT3 to Interleukin-6 stimulation was increased in Sgms-deficient cells. Using tofacitinib, a clinical JAK inhibitor, the study showed that SM deficiency might participate in STAT3 phosphorylation via JAK activation. Overall, these results demonstrate that SM is essential for maintaining the cutaneous barrier via the STAT3 pathway, suggesting SM could be a potential therapeutic target for dermatitis treatment."
https://openalex.org/W4214496854,"Fatigue is a major cause of exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD). Compression garments (CGs) can aid post-exercise recovery, therefore, this study explored the effects of CGs on muscular efficacy, proprioception, and recovery after exercise-induced muscle fatigue in people who exercise regularly. Twelve healthy participants who exercised regularly were enrolled in this study. Each participant completed an exercise-induced muscle fatigue test while wearing a randomly assigned lower-body CG or sports pants (SP); after at least 7 days, the participant repeated the test while wearing the other garment. The dependent variables were muscle efficacy, proprioception (displacements of center of pressure/COP, and absolute error), and fatigue recovery (muscle oxygen saturation/SmO2, deoxygenation and reoxygenation rate, and subjective muscle soreness). A two-way repeated measure analysis of variance was conducted to determine the effect of garment type. The results indicated that relative to SP use, CG use can promote muscle efficacy, proprioception in ML displacement of COP, and fatigue recovery. Higher deoxygenation and reoxygenation rates were observed with CG use than with SP use. For CG use, SmO2 quickly returned to baseline value after 10 min of rest and was maintained at a high level until after 1 h of rest, whereas for SP use, SmO2 increased with time after fatigue onset. ML displacement of COP quickly returned to baseline value after 10 min of rest and subsequently decreased until after 1 hour of rest. Relative to SP use, CG use was associated with a significantly lower ML displacement after 20 min of rest. In conclusion, proprioception and SmO2 recovery was achieved after 10 min of rest; however, at least 24 h may be required for recovery pertaining to muscle efficacy and soreness regardless of CG or SP use."
https://openalex.org/W4214512464,"We investigated the relationships between political beliefs regarding two aspects of the right-left distinction (cultural and economic) and the acceptance of the pandemic restrictions using variable-centred and person-centred approaches. The community sample consisted of 305 participants. Four groups of the restrictions were considered. Religious fundamentalism predicted positively the acceptance of the restrictions associated with the limitations of labour rights and those limiting civil rights without a direct impact on safety . Anti-welfare negatively predicted the acceptance of the restrictions regarding social distancing and those limiting civil rights and increasing safety . These associations were discussed in relation to basic needs and values which motivate persons who endorse right-wing or left-wing political views. The latent profile analysis revealed three profiles of political beliefs, which were termed “Conservative Statists,” “Liberal Laissez-fairists,” and “Conservative Laissez-fairists.” The profiles differed in terms of acceptance of the pandemic restrictions, and the patterns of these relationships were different for particular groups of restrictions."
https://openalex.org/W4214687308,"Accurate assessment and monitoring of the Plasmodium falciparum Kelch 13 (pfk13) gene associated with artemisinin resistance is critical to understand the emergence and spread of drug-resistant parasites in malaria-endemic regions. In this study, we evaluated the genomic profile of the pfk13 gene associated with artemisinin resistance in P. falciparum in Nigerian children by targeted sequencing of the pfk13 gene. Genomic DNA was extracted from 332 dried blood (DBS) spot filter paper samples from three Nigerian States. The pfk13 gene was amplified by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and amplicons were sequenced to detect known and novel polymorphisms across the gene. Consensus sequences of samples were mapped to the reference gene sequence obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Out of the 13 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) detected in the pfk13 gene, five (F451L, N664I, V487E, V692G and Q661H) have not been reported in other endemic countries to the best of our knowledge. Three of these SNPs (V692G, N664I and Q661H) and a non-novel SNP, C469C, were consistent with late parasitological failure (LPF) in two States (Enugu and Plateau States). There was no validated mutation associated with artemisinin resistance in this study. However, a correlation of our study with in vivo and in vitro phenotypes is needed to establish the functional role of detected mutations as markers of artemisinin resistance in Nigeria. This baseline information will be essential in tracking and monitoring P. falciparum resistance to artemisinin in Nigeria."
https://openalex.org/W4214691702,"Diabetes mellitus is one of the major concerns for health care systems, affecting 382 million people worldwide. Among the different complications of diabetes, lower limbs chronic ulceration is a common, severe and costly cause of morbidity. Diabetic foot ulcers are a leading cause of hospitalization in diabetic patients and its rate exceed the ones of congestive heart failure, depression or renal disease. Diabetic non-healing ulcers account for more than 60% of all non-traumatic lower limb amputations and the five-year mortality after amputation is higher than 50%, being equal to several types of advanced cancer. The primary management goals for an existing diabetic foot ulcer are to achieve primary healing as expeditiously as possible and to achieve a reduction of the amputation rate in the patients. Unfortunately, approximately a quarter of patients do not partially or fully respond to the standard of care. Advanced therapies for chronic wounds are existing, however, recent guidelines including the latest reviews and meta-analyses of the scientific and clinical evidence available from current treatment strategies and new therapeutic agents revealed that there is a lack of clinical data and persistent gap of evidence for many of the advanced therapeutic approaches. In addition, no pharmacological wound healing product has gained authority approval for more than 10 years in both US and EU, constituting a highly unmet medical need. In this publication we present data from a live biopharmaceutical product AUP1602-C designed as a single pharmaceutical entity based on the non-pathogenic, food-grade lactic acid bacterium Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris that has been genetically engineered to produce human fibroblast growth factor 2,interleukin4 and colony stimulating factor 1. Designed to address different aspects of wound healing (i.e. fibroblast proliferation, angiogenesis and immune cell activation) and currently in phase I clinical study, we show how the combination of the individual components on the wound micro-environment initiates and improves the wound healing in chronic wounds."
https://openalex.org/W4214705888,"Fetal heart rate variability (FHRV) has shown potential in fetal surveillance. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the reliability of time domain and spectral domain parameters based on non-invasive fetal electrocardiography (NI-FECG).NI-FECG, with a sampling frequency of 1 kHz, was obtained in 75 healthy, singleton pregnant women between gestational age (GA) 20+0 to 41+0. The recording was divided into a) heart rate pattern (HRP) and b) periods fulfilling certain criteria of stationarity of RR-intervals, termed stationary heart rate pattern (SHRP). Within each recording, the first and the last time series from each HRP with less than 5% artifact correction were analyzed and compared. Standard deviation of normal-to-normal RR-intervals (SDNN), root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD), high frequency power (HF-power), low frequency power (LF-power), and LF-power/HF-power were performed. A multivariate mixed model was used and acceptable reliability was defined as intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) ≥ 0.80 and a coefficient of variation (CV) ≤ 15%. Based on these results, the CV and ICC were computed if the average of two to six time series was used.For GA 28+0 to 34+6, SDNN and RMSSD exhibited acceptable reliability (CV < 15%; ICC > 90%), whereas GA 35+0 to 41+0and 20+0 to 27+6 showed higher CVs. Spectral domain parameters also showed high CVs However, by using the mean value of two to six time series, acceptable reliability in SDNN, RMSSD and HF-power from GA 28+0 was achieved. Stationarity of RR-intervals showed high influence on reliability and SHRP was superior to HRP, whereas the length of the time series showed minor influence.Acceptable reliability seems achievable in SDNN, RMSSD and HF-power from gestational week 28. However, stationarity of RR-intervals should be considered when selecting time series for analyses."
https://openalex.org/W4214708122,"Clinical adoption of immune checkpoint inhibitors in cancer management has highlighted the interconnection between carcinogenesis and the immune system. Immune cells are integral to the tumour microenvironment and can influence the outcome of therapies. Better understanding of an individual’s immune landscape may play an important role in treatment personalisation. Peripheral blood is a readily accessible source of information to study an individual’s immune landscape compared to more complex and invasive tumour bioipsies, and may hold immense diagnostic and prognostic potential. Identifying the critical components of these immune signatures in peripheral blood presents an attractive alternative to tumour biopsy-based immune phenotyping strategies. We used two syngeneic solid tumour models, a 4T1 breast cancer model and a CT26 colorectal cancer model, in a longitudinal study of the peripheral blood immune landscape. Our strategy combined two highly accessible approaches, blood leukocyte immune phenotyping and plasma soluble immune factor characterisation, to identify distinguishing immune signatures of the CT26 and 4T1 tumour models using machine learning. Myeloid cells, specifically neutrophils and PD-L1-expressing myeloid cells, were found to correlate with tumour size in both the models. Elevated levels of G-CSF, IL-6 and CXCL13, and B cell counts were associated with 4T1 growth, whereas CCL17, CXCL10, total myeloid cells, CCL2, IL-10, CXCL1, and Ly6C intermediate monocytes were associated with CT26 tumour development. Peripheral blood appears to be an accessible means to interrogate tumour-dependent changes to the host immune landscape, and to identify blood immune phenotypes for future treatment stratification."
https://openalex.org/W4214545573,"The prevalence and molecular characteristics of Bartonella infections in small rodents in the Zhongtiao Mountain, China have been explored. In this study, the liver, spleen and kidney tissues of captured rodents were used for Bartonella spp. detection and identification by combination of real-time PCR of transfer-mRNA (ssrA) gene and traditional PCR and sequencing of citrate synthase (gltA) gene. It was shown that 49.52% of the rodents (52/105) were positive for Bartonella spp.. The infection rate in different gender (χ2 = 0.079, P = 0.778) and tissues (χ2 = 0.233, P = 0.890) of small rodents did not have statistical difference, but that in different small rodents (Fisher's exact test, P < 0.001) and habitats (χ2 = 5.483, P = 0.019) had statistical difference. And, the sequencing data suggests that Bartonella sequences (n = 31) were identified into three species, including 14 of B. grahamii, 3 of B. queenslandensis and 14 of unknown Bartonella species. Phylogenetic analysis showed that B. grahamii sequences were clustered with the isolates from South Korea and China, and B. queenslandensis sequences were mainly closely related to the isolates from China and Thailand. The genetic diversity analysis showed that B. grahamii and B. queenslandensis sequences exhibited noticeable intraspecies diversity. Taken together our data demonstrates the high prevalence and genetic diversity of Bartonella infections in small rodents in the Zhongtiao Mountain, especially a potential novel Bartonella specie was detected, which could benefit the prevention and control of rodent-Bartonella species in this area."
https://openalex.org/W4214643478,"Cotrimoxazole and isoniazid preventive therapy (CPT, IPT) have been shown to be efficacious therapies for the prevention of opportunistic infections and tuberculosis (TB) among people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Despite governments' efforts to translate World Health Organization recommendations into practice, implementation remains challenging. This review aimed to explore and compare CPT and IPT with respect to similarities and differences of barriers identified across high TB/HIV burden countries. A secondary objective was to identify facilitators for implementing both preventive therapies.We searched MEDLINE, Web of Science and SCOPUS databases for peer-reviewed literature published before September 2020. We extracted and synthesized our findings using Maxqda software. We applied framework synthesis in conjunction with metasummary to compare both therapies with respect to similarities and differences of barriers identified across seven health system components (in line with the modified WHO's Framework for action). Protocol registration: PROSPERO (CRD42019137778).We identified four hundred and eighty-two papers, of which we included forty for review. Although most barrier themes were identical for both preventive therapies, we identified seven intervention-specific themes. Like for CPT, barriers identified for IPT were most frequently classified as 'service delivery-related barriers' and 'patient & community-related barriers'. 'Health provider-related barriers' played an important role for implementing IPT. Most facilitators identified referred to health system strengthening activities.For researchers with limited working experience in high TB/HIV burden countries, this review can provide valuable insights about barriers that may arise at different levels of the health system. For policymakers in high TB/HIV burden countries, this review offers strategies for improving the delivery of IPT (or any newer therapy regimen) for the prevention of TB. Based on our findings, we suggest initial and continuous stakeholder involvement, focusing on the efficient use and reinforcement of existing resources for health."
https://openalex.org/W4214718707,"Fractional fluid models are usually difficult to solve analytically due to complicated mathematical calculations. This difficulty in considering fractional model further increases when one considers nth order chemical reaction. Therefore, in this work an incompressible nanofluid flow as well as the benefits of free convection across an isothermal vertical sheet is examined numerically. An nth order chemical reaction is considered in the chemical species model. The specified velocity (wall's) is time-based, and its motion is translational into mathematical form. The fractional differential equations are used to express the governing flow equations (FDEs). The non-dimensional controlling system is given appropriate transformations. A Crank Nicholson method is used to find solutions for temperature, solute concentration, and velocity. Variation in concentration, velocity, and temperature profiles is produced as a result of changes in discussed parameters for both Ag-based and Cu-based nanofluid values. Water is taken as base fluid. The fractional-order time evaluation has opened the new gateways to study the problem into a new direction and it also increased the choices due to the extended version. It records the hidden figures of the problem between the defined domain of the time evaluation. The suggested technique has good accuracy, dependability, effectiveness and it also cover the better physics of the problem specially with concepts of fractional calculus."

We find that our primary damage response variable <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" display=""inline"" id=""M1""><mml:mover><mml:msub><mml:mi>t</mml:mi> <mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn> <mml:mo>.</mml:mo> <mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub> <mml:mo>¯</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math> , which is the average shortest time needed to reach all nodes in a road network (which stand in for locations within a metropolitan area) from an initial node (which stands in for the location of a center for disaster relief operations), is strongly linearly–correlated with p d , the fraction of the road network segments damaged. We find that this result, previously reported for a city’s road network as opposed to grid and scale-free idealizations, is widely present across the road networks we have examined regardless of location. Furthermore, we identify three families of road networks according to their damage response, forming a typology by which we can classify city road networks. Using this typology, we identify the family of road networks which may be of most concern from a humanitarian standpoint. We also find that, of the properties of the road networks we examined, the average shortest path length, 〈 l min 〉 and the average node degree, 〈 k 〉, proxies for city road network size and complexity respectively, are very significantly–correlated with damage susceptibility. In addition to forming a damage response typology by which city road networks could be classified, we consider five cities in detail, looking at risks and previous disaster events. Our results offer a generalizable framework in evaluating the feasibility of coursing relief efforts within disaster–affected areas using land–based transportation methods. They also provide, albeit in retrospect, a glimpse of the time difficulties which occurred, and the stakes of life involved in the humanitarian crisis which developed in the Kathmandu area due to the earthquakes of April and May 2015."
https://openalex.org/W4214759650,"Zyxin is a zinc-binding phosphoprotein known to regulate cell migration, adhesion, and cell survival. Zyxin also plays a role in signal transduction between focal adhesions and the nuclear compartment. However, the mechanism of Zyxin shuttling to nucleus is still unclear. Here, we identify that the GlcNAc transferase (O-linked GlcNAc [O-GlcNAc] transferase) can O-GlcNAcylate Zyxin and regulate its nuclear localization. We show that O-GlcNAc transferase O-GlcNAcylates Zyxin at two residues, serine 169 (Ser-169) and Ser-246. In addition, O-GlcNAcylation of Ser-169, but not Ser-246, enhances its interaction with 14-3-3γ, which is a phosphoserine/threonine-binding protein and is reported to bind with phosphorylated Zyxin. Furthermore, we found that 14-3-3γ could promote the nuclear localization of Zyxin after Ser-169 O-GlcNAcylation by affecting the function of the N-terminal nuclear export signal sequence; functionally, UV treatment increases the O-GlcNAcylation of Zyxin, which may enhance the nuclear location of Zyxin. Finally, Zyxin in the nucleus maintains homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 stability and promotes UV-induced cell death. In conclusion, we uncover that the nuclear localization of Zyxin can be regulated by its O-GlcNAcylation, and that this protein may regulate UV-induced cell death.

Zyxin is a member of the LIN-11, Isl1, and MEC-3 (LIM) domain protein family, primarily localizing in focal adhesion plaques (1Smith M.A. Hoffman L.M. Beckerle M.C. LIM proteins in actin cytoskeleton mechanoresponse.Trends Cell Biol. 2014; 24: 575-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LIM domains have been shown to participate in specific protein–protein interactions or protein–DNA interactions. Zyxin plays important roles in the actin cytoskeleton. Zyxin has an α-actinin-binding domain at the N terminus, which specifically interacts with α-actinin (2Crawford A.W. Michelsen J.W. Beckerle M.C. An interaction between zyxin and alpha-actinin.J.

In addition, the N terminus of Zyxin can also bind to vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP), and the interaction between Zyxin and VASP mainly functions in the assembly of stress fibers (6Golsteyn R.M. Beckerle M.C. Koay T. Friederich E. Structural and functional similarities between the human cytoskeletal protein zyxin and the ActA protein of Listeria monocytogenes.J.

Notably, Zyxin is closely related to the genesis and development of tumors. For instance, recent studies have shown that Zyxin is a positive regulator of Hippo–Yes-associated protein (YAP) signaling pathway. Zyxin acts as a scaffold protein to form ternary complex with seven in absentia homolog 2 (SIAH2) and large tumor suppressor kinase 2 (LATS2) regulating the activity of YAP and the growth of cells (9Ma B. Cheng H. Gao R. Mu C. Chen L. Wu S. Chen Q. Zhu Y. Zyxin-Siah2-Lats2 axis mediates cooperation between Hippo and TGF-beta signalling pathways.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7: 11123Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that Zyxin is phosphorylated by cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) during mitosis, which is necessary for cell growth, suggesting that Zyxin promotes colon cancer tumorigenesis through cyclin-dependent kinase 8 (CDK8)–mediated YAP activation in a mitotic phosphorylation–dependent manner (10Zhou J. Zeng Y. Cui L. Chen X. Stauffer S. Wang Z. Yu F. Lele S.M. Talmon G.A. Black A.R. Chen Y. Dong J. Zyxin promotes colon cancer tumorigenesis in a mitotic phosphorylation-dependent manner and through CDK8-mediated YAP activation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2018; 115: E6760-E6769Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Zyxin plays important roles in the nuclear–cytoplasmic communication. Zyxin has two nuclear export signal (NES) sequences near the N terminus and C terminus, respectively, which indicates that Zyxin shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Addition of nuclear export inhibitor, leptomycin B, leads to nuclear localization of Zyxin, indicating that Zyxin functions both on focal adhesions and nucleus (11Nix D.A. Fradelizi J. Bockholt S. Menichi B. Louvard D. Friederich E. Beckerle M.C. Targeting of zyxin to sites of actin membrane interaction and to the nucleus.J. Biol.

From the membrane to the nucleus and back again: Bifunctional focal adhesion proteins.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2006; 18: 524-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). However, as Zyxin lacks canonical nuclear localization signals, the mechanism of Zyxin translocation to nucleus is still unclear (12Hervy M. Hoffman L. Beckerle M.C.

Acta. 2003; 1593: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Zyxin may regulate gene expression in nucleus through interacting with transcription machinery (15Sabino F. Madzharova E. Auf dem Keller U. Cell density-dependent proteolysis by HtrA1 induces translocation of zyxin to the nucleus and increased cell survival.Cell Death Dis. 2020; 11: 674Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the nucleoplasm shuttle of Zyxin may also be related to apoptosis. It has been reported that Zyxin serves as an important regulator in homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2)–p53 signaling axis in DNA damage response (16Hofmann T.G. Moller A. Sirma H. Zentgraf H. Taya Y. Droge W. Will H. Schmitz M.L. Regulation of p53 activity by its interaction with homeodomain-interacting protein kinase-2.Nat.

Control of HIPK2 stability by ubiquitin ligase Siah-1 and checkpoint kinases ATM and ATR.Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 812-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Upon UV irradiation, Zyxin modulates the activity of p53 by regulating the stability of HIPK2, which used to be bound and degraded by the E3 ubiquitin ligase seven in absentia homolog 1 (SIAH1). Zyxin is identified to stabilize HIPK2, especially with nuclear localization. Zyxin in the nucleus interacts with the SIAH1 and regulates HIPK2 stability through interference with the functional active dimerization of SIAH1, which stabilizes HIPK2 and activates p53 to modulate UV-induced cell death (18Crone J. Glas C. Schultheiss K. Moehlenbrink J. Krieghoff-Henning E. Hofmann T.G. Zyxin is a critical regulator of the apoptotic HIPK2-p53 signaling axis.Cancer Res. 2011; 71: 2350-2359Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Protein glycosylation with O-linked GlcNAc (O-GlcNAc) is a post-translational modification that is widely present in various intracellular components (19Bond M.R. Hanover J.A. O-GlcNAc cycling: A link between metabolism and chronic disease.Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2013; 33: 205-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 20Yang X. Qian K. Protein O-GlcNAcylation: Emerging mechanisms and functions.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2017; 18: 452-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). O-GlcNAcylation is controlled by a pair of enzymes: O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and O-GlcNAc glycosidase (O-GlcNAcase [OGA]) (21Hart G.W. Housley M.P. Slawson C. Cycling of O-linked beta-N-acetylglucosamine on nucleocytoplasmic proteins.Nature. 2007; 446: 1017-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). OGT transfers UDP-GlcNAc to the serine (Ser) or threonine (Thr) residues of the target protein, whereas OGA catalyzes the removal of UDP-GlcNAc from protein residues. O-GlcNAcylation appears in various organelles, such as the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, nucleus, and mitochondria, and plays a pivotal role in multiple processes, such as mRNA transcription, cell cycle, neurodevelopment, stress response, and metabolic homeostasis (22Zachara N.E.

Moreover, it has been reported that O-GlcNAcylation is abundant in cytoskeleton proteins or its regulatory proteins and is closely related to breast cancer metastasis, indicating that O-GlcNAcylation may make a difference in coordinating cell migration (22Zachara N.E.

GlcNAcylation plays an essential role in breast cancer metastasis.Cancer Res. 2010; 70: 6344-6351Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In this study, we showed that Zyxin is O-GlcNAcylated by OGT at Ser-169 and Ser-246. O-GlcNAcylation of Zyxin at Ser-169 could promote the nuclear localization of Zyxin in 14-3-3γ-dependent manner. Furthermore, O-GlcNAcylation of Zyxin may play a critical role in UV-induced cell death through regulating the HIPK2–p53 signaling axis. Our findings provide novel insights into the regulatory mechanisms of Zyxin nuclear shuttling and reveal the possible implications of aberrant Zyxin O-GlcNAcylation in cancer malignancies. We found that Zyxin could be O-GlcNAcylated by OGT. The S protein-Flag-Streptavidin binding peptide (SFB)-Zyxin was transfected into human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells and immunoprecipitated by streptavidin beads in indicated conditions. Then, pan-O-GlcNAcylation antibody CTD110.6 was used to determine whether Zyxin could be O-GlcNAcylated. The results showed that Zyxin could be apparently O-GlcNAcylated, and the level of Zyxin O-GlcNAcylation increased significantly when the cells were treated by thiamet-G (TG, 10 μM), the inhibitor of OGA, or overexpression of Myc-OGT (Figs. 1A and S1A). In contrast, when Myc-OGA was overexpressed to reduce the global O-GlcNAcylation level, the O-GlcNAcylation modification of Zyxin decreased dramatically (Fig. 1B). And we got the same results in cells with endogenous OGT depletion or low glucose treatment (Fig. 1B). To examine the O-GlcNAcylation status of endogenous Zyxin, we immunoprecipitated endogenous Zyxin and found that endogenous Zyxin could also be O-GlcNAcylated (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, Zyxin could interact with OGT (Fig. 1D). These data demonstrated that Zyxin could be O-GlcNAcylated by OGT. To identify the O-GlcNAcylated sites on Zyxin, the protein sequence of Zyxin was analyzed using YinOYang 1.2 Server (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/YinOYang/) to find the possible O-GlcNAcylation sites (Fig. S1, B and C). We then constructed the indicated Zyxin mutations based on the predicted potential of O-GlcNAcylation to determine the real O-GlcNAcylation sites on Zyxin (Figs. 1E and S1D). Zyxin mutations were transfected into HEK293T cells, and the O-GlcNAcylation modification was determined as in Figure 1A. The results show that S169A or S246A mutation could obviously affect the O-GlcNAcylation of Zyxin (Figs. 1E and S1D). To further confirm this finding, we constructed the Zyxin mutants in which both Ser-169 and Ser-246 sites were replaced with alanine (Ala), called Zyxin-dA. Wildtype, S169A, S246A, or dA was expressed in HEK293T cells, and the O-GlcNAcylation of each mutant was determined. These cells were treated with TG to inhibit endogenous OGA to enhance O-GlcNAcylation signals or cotransfected with Myc-OGA to reduce O-GlcNAcylation. The results showed that the O-GlcNAcylation of S169A or S246A mutant decreased significantly in contrast to wildtype Zyxin (Fig. 1F). Intriguingly, the O-GlcNAcylation of dA mutant was completely abolished (Fig. 1F), suggesting that Ser-169 and Ser-246 are the major O-GlcNAcylation sites on Zyxin. To further confirm the presence of O-GlcNAcylation on Zyxin, we used purified glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-OGT and His-Zyxin to perform in vitro O-GlcNAcylation assay to determine the O-GlcNAcylation on Zyxin. The result showed that Zyxin was directly O-GlcNAcylated by GST-OGT, and the O-GlcNAcylation level of wildtype Zyxin was much higher than that of S169A mutant (Fig. S1E), suggesting that Ser-169 of Zyxin could be directly O-GlcNAcylated by OGT. Furthermore, we examined the O-GlcNAcylation of Zyxin and S169A mutant using another O-GlcNAcylation recognition antibody, RL2, which confirmed that Ser-169 was the real O-GlcNAcylation site on Zyxin (Fig. S1F). Thus, we demonstrated that Ser-169 of Zyxin could be O-GlcNAcylated by OGT. It has recently been reported that OGT could recognize cysteine (Cys) and generate a thio-linked GlcNAc, which is hydrolytically stable and accurate structural mimic of O-GlcNAc (30Rao F.V.

To examine the site-specific O-GlcNAcylation of Zyxin, we constructed SFB-Zyxin mutants in which Ser-169 or Ser-246 sites was replaced by Cys. The results showed that O-GlcNAcylation of wildtype Zyxin was reduced when OGA was overexpressed (Fig. 1G). Intriguingly, the thio-linked GlcNAc modification on the S169C–S246A mutant slightly decreased in contrast to S246C–S169A mutant, which showed significant decrease with OGA overexpression, indicating that Ser-169 is the major O-GlcNAcylation site of Zyxin instead of Ser-246. OGT could O-GlcNAcylate actin cytoskeletal regulatory proteins (28Xu Z. Isaji T. Fukuda T. Wang Y. Gu J.

GlcNAcylation plays an essential role in breast cancer metastasis.Cancer Res. 2010; 70: 6344-6351Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). To confirm this phenomenon, we depleted endogenous OGT using shRNA and assessed the cell mobility by wound healing assay. The cell mobility dramatically declined when OGT was depleted (Fig. 2, A–C). As Zyxin is an actin-binding protein and plays an important role in cell migration, we assumed that the O-GlcNAcylation of Zyxin may also regulate cell migration. To test this hypothesis, we depleted endogenous Zyxin in MDA-MB-231 cells through shRNA and rescued cells with wildtype Zyxin or dA mutant, respectively (Fig. 2D). We found that the mobility of Zyxin-depleted cells was impaired. Interestingly, the cell motility defects in Zyxin-depleted cells could be rescued by wildtype Zyxin but not dA mutant, indicating that the O-GlcNAcylation of Zyxin promotes cell migration (Fig. 2, E and F). These data suggested that O-GlcNAcylation of Zyxin was also involved in the regulation of cell mobility. The N terminus of Zyxin contains four proline-rich ActA repeats that mediate the interaction between Zyxin and the actin regulator VASP (6Golsteyn R.M. Beckerle M.C. Koay T. Friederich E.

We wondered whether O-GlcNAcylation of Zyxin, which also locates at the N terminus, would affect the interaction between Zyxin and VASP. We examined the interactions between Zyxin and VASP at different O-GlcNAcylation levels and found that there was no significant change (Fig. S2), indicating that Zyxin O-GlcNAcylation did not affect ActA repeat–mediated protein interactions. Meanwhile, we found that Zyxin O-GlcNAcylation did not affect its interaction with SIAH2 neither (Fig. S2), which mediates the role of Zyxin in regulating Hippo pathway (9Ma B. Cheng H. Gao R. Mu C. Chen L. Wu S. Chen Q. Zhu Y. Zyxin-Siah2-Lats2 axis mediates cooperation between Hippo and TGF-beta signalling pathways.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7: 11123Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). It has been reported that protein O-GlcNAcylation could be recognized by 14-3-3γ (34Toleman C.A. Schumacher M.A. Yu S.H. Zeng W. Cox N.J. Smith T.J. Soderblom E.J. Wands A.M. Kohler J.J. Boyce M.

As 14-3-3γ is a Zyxin-associated protein, we conjecture whether the O-GlcNAcylation of Zyxin regulates its interaction with 14-3-3γ. To confirm this hypothesis, we purified the GST-tagged 14-3-3γ proteins and found that GST-14-3-3γ could pull down SFB-Zyxin (Fig. 3A). This GST pull-down assay was independently repeated for three times, and the rate measurement of each experiment was shown (Fig. S3A). Interestingly, OGA inhibitor treatment enhanced this interaction, and OGA overexpression decreased this interaction (Figs. 3A and S3A), indicating that the interaction between Zyxin and 14-3-3γ may be regulated by the level of Zyxin O-GlcNAcylation. To further validate role of Zyxin O-GlcNAcylation on its interaction with 14-3-3γ, we transfected wildtype Zyxin or S169A, S169C, S246A, S246C mutants into HEK293T cells, respectively. GST pull-down assay showed that the interaction between S169C mutant and 14-3-3γ was increased significantly, whereas the interaction between S246C and 14-3-3γ exhibited slight alterations (Figs. 3B and S3B), suggesting that O-GlcNAcylation of Ser-169, but not Ser-246, promoted the association between 14-3-3γ and Zyxin. It has been reported that the phosphorylation of Zyxin Ser-142 was also involved in its interaction with 14-3-3γ (35Chan C.B. Liu X. Tang X. Fu H. Ye K. Akt phosphorylation of zyxin mediates its interaction with acinus-S and prevents acinus-triggered chromatin condensation.Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 1688-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We compared the effects of phosphorylation of Ser-142 and O-GlcNAcylation of Ser-169 on the interaction between Zyxin and 14-3-3γ. First, we found that S142D–S169C mutant showed strongest interaction with 14-3-3γ, and S169C mutant also showed stronger interaction with 14-3-3γ than S142D mutant (Figs. 3C and S3C), indicating that the effect of Zyxin O-GlcNAcylation on its interaction with 14-3-3γ may be stronger than Zyxin phosphorylation. Furthermore, we constructed S169C–S142A mutant, which maintains protein O-GlcNAcylation and lacks protein phosphorylation. GST pull-down assay showed that S142A–S169C mutant still have stronger interaction with 14-3-3γ (Figs. 3C and S3C), suggesting that Ser-169 O-GlcNAcylation alone could promote the interaction between Zyxin and 14-3-3γ. As Ser-169 might also be a phosphorylation site, we examined whether the effect of Ser-169 on the interaction between Zyxin and 14-3-3γ solely depends on Ser-169 O-GlcNAcylation but not Ser-169 phosphorylation. The results showed that S169D mutant, which mimicked the Ser-169 phosphorylation, did not increase the interaction between Zyxin and 14-3-3γ, which was the same as S169A, implying that Ser-169 O-GlcNAcylation could be specifically recognized by 14-3-3γ (Figs. 3D and S3D). We got the same results by coimmunoprecipitation in HEK293T cells overexpressing SFB-14-3-3γ and Zyxin mutants (Figs. 3E and S3E). We also compared the affinity between 14-3-3γ and Zyxin with different Zyxin O-GlcNAcylation level. Decreasing O-GlcNAcylation level by overexpression of OGA reduced the affinity between 14-3-3γ and wildtype Zyxin but not S169C mutant (Figs. 3F and S3F), indicating that Ser-169 O-GlcNAcylation is important for its interaction with 14-3-3γ. To determine whether 14-3-3γ directly bound with Zyxin, we conducted in vitro GST pull-down experiments using GST-14-3-3γ and His-Zyxin protein. We found that GST-14-3-3γ but not GST protein could pull down wildtype His-Zyxin, suggesting that these two proteins did interact directly (Fig. S3H). Furthermore, to explore the role of O-GlcNAcylation on the association between GST-14-3-3γ and Zyxin, we first used His-OGT protein to O-GlcNAcylate wildtype His-Zyxin or His-Zyxin S169A mutant for 4 h. Then, we added GST-14-3-3γ to pull down these His-Zyxin proteins. We found that, in contrast to His-Zyxin S169A, OGT treatment significantly increased the association between GST-14-3-3γ and wildtype His-Zyxin, indicating that the interaction between these two proteins was regulated by O-GlcNAcylation (Fig. 3G). Thus, we demonstrated that O-GlcNAcylation of Zyxin facilitated the direct association between GST-14-3-3γ and His-Zyxin. Previous study showed that arginine (Arg)-57, tyrosine (Tyr)-133, asparagine (Asn)-178, and valine (Val)-181 are the key binding sites on 14-3-3γ, which is required for phosphorylation (Arg-57 and Tyr-133) or O-GlcNAcylation binding (Asn-178 and Val-181) (34Toleman C.A. Schumacher M.A. Yu S.H. Zeng W. Cox N.J. Smith T.J. Soderblom E.J. Wands A.M. Kohler J.J. Boyce M. Structural basis of O-GlcNAc recognition by mammalian 14-3-3 proteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2018; 115: 5956-5961Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We constructed these mutants of 14-3-3γ and checked their affinity with Zyxin S169C mutant. The results revealed that V181W, one of O-GlcNAcylated group recognition-defective mutants, obviously decreased its interaction with Zyxin S169C (Figs. 3H and S3G). R57E or Y133E, which affects the recognition of phosphorylation modification by 14-3-3γ, did not affect its interaction with Zyxin. N178Y mutant, which has been shown to be important for its recognition of O-GlcNAcylation modification, did not show obvious change when compared with wildtype 14-3-3γ, suggesting that Val-181 is important for the interaction between 14-3-3γ and Zyxin Ser-169 O-GlcNAcylation. Taken together, these findings suggested Zyxin Ser-169 O-GlcNAcylation was an important regulator of its interaction with 14-3-3γ. There are two leucine-rich NESs within Zyxin protein, and Zyxin can shuttle between cytoplasm and nucleus. It has been reported that 14-3-3γ triggers Zyxin nuclear localization, which requires Akt-dependent Ser-142 phosphorylation (34Toleman C.A. Schumacher M.A. Yu S.H. Zeng W. Cox N.J. Smith T.J. Soderblom E.J. Wands A.M. Kohler J.J. Boyce M. Structural basis of O-GlcNAc recognition by mammalian 14-3-3 proteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2018; 115: 5956-5961Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). As Zyxin O-GlcNAcylation enhanced the association between 14-3-3γ and Zyxin, we hypothesize that Zyxin O-GlcNAcylation may also promote 14-3-3γ-dependent Zyxin nuclear localization. To verify our speculation, we analyzed the cytoplasmic and nuclear distributions of Zyxin in HCT116 cells treated with TG or dimethyl sulfoxide by immunofluorescence (IF) and Western blot assay. We found that around 18% of cells showed obvious Zyxin nuclear localization with TG treatment in contrast to 9% in dimethyl sulfoxide–treated cells (Fig. 4A). Consistently, nuclear fraction of Zyxin increased remarkably upon TG treatment (Fig. 4B). These results suggested that protein O-GlcNAcylation may promote the nuclear distribution of Zyxin. Next, we compared Zyxin nuclear distribution of wildtype GFP-Zyxin and indicated Zyxin mutants. The nuclear distribution of S169A mutant decreased greatly compared with wildtype Zyxin or S169C mutant (Figs. 4C and S4A). Interesting"

Here, we have investigated the effect of A2A and A2B -selective agonists on vasodilatation in three distinct vascular beds of the rat cardiovascular system. NanoBRET ligand binding studies were used to confirm receptor selectivity. The regional hemodynamic effects of adenosine A2A and A2B selective agonists were investigated in conscious rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (350-450 g) were chronically implanted with pulsed Doppler flow probes on the renal artery, mesenteric artery, and the descending abdominal aorta. Cardiovascular responses were measured following intravenous infusion (3 min for each dose) of the A2A -selective agonist CGS 21680 (0.1, 0.3, 1 µg kg-1 min-1 ) or the A2B -selective agonist BAY 60-6583 (4,13.3, 40 µg kg-1 min-1 ) following predosing with the A2A -selective antagonist SCH 58261 (0.1 or 1 mg kg-1 min-1 ), the A2B /A2A antagonist PSB 1115 (10 mg kg-1 min-1 ) or vehicle. The A2A -selective agonist CGS 21680 produced a striking increase in heart rate (HR) and hindquarters vascular conductance (VC) that was accompanied by a significant decrease in mean arterial pressure (MAP) in conscious rats. In marked contrast, the A2B -selective agonist BAY 60-6583 significantly increased HR and VC in the renal and mesenteric vascular beds, but not in the hindquarters. Taken together, these data indicate that A2A and A2B receptors are regionally selective in their regulation of vascular tone. These results suggest that the development of A2B receptor agonists to induce vasodilatation in the kidney may provide a good therapeutic approach for the treatment of acute kidney injury."

Whether patients with SMI are at increased risk of COVID-19 is, however, sparsely investigated. This important issue must be addressed as the current pandemic could have the potential to increase the existing gap in lifetime mortality between this group of patients and the background population. The objective of this study was to determine whether a diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder is associated with an increased risk of COVID-19. A cross-sectional study was performed between January 18 th and February 25 th , 2021. Of 7071 eligible patients with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder, 1355 patients from seven psychiatric centres in the Capital Region of Denmark were screened for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies. A total of 1258 unvaccinated patients were included in the analysis. The mean age was 40.5 years (SD 14.6), 54.3% were female. Fifty-nine of the 1258 participants had a positive SARS-CoV-2 antibody test, corresponding to a adjusted seroprevalence of 4.96% (95% CI 3.87–6.35). No significant difference in SARS-CoV-2-risk was found between female and male participants (RR = 1.32; 95% CI 0.79–2.20; p = .290). No significant differences in seroprevalences between schizophrenia and bipolar disease were found (RR = 1.12; 95% CI 0.67–1.87; p = .667). Seroprevalence among 6088 unvaccinated blood donors from the same region and period was 12.24% (95% CI 11.41–13.11). SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among included patients with SMI was significantly lower than among blood donors (RR = 0.41; 95% CI 0.31–0.52; p &lt; .001). Differences in seroprevalences remained significant when adjusting for gender and age, except for those aged 60 years or above.

https://openalex.org/W4214506686,"The reproductive success of animals breeding in cities is often lower compared to counterparts that inhabit rural, suburban, and peri-urban areas. Urban dwelling may be especially costly for offspring development and survival. Diet composition and diversity may underlie factors that lead to lower fitness, particularly if prey abundance and quality decline in modified environments. Moreover, breeding success may change over the course of a season, an effect that may be augmented in urban areas. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that habitat and date affected nestling house wren (Troglodytes aedon) body condition and survival, and examined whether diet explained differences in nestling success. We monitored urban and rural populations of house wrens breeding in nest boxes, and tested whether clutch size, nestling survivorship, and nestling body condition varied by habitat or by date, and then characterized the diet of a subset of nestlings with DNA metabarcoding of fecal samples. Urbanization had clear impacts on house wren nestling fitness: urban broods contained fewer, smaller nestlings. Early nestling survival decreased as the breeding season progressed, and this effect was more pronounced in the urban population. However, the diets of urban and rural nestlings were similar and did not explain differences in body condition. Instead, across populations, diet changed with date, becoming less diverse, with fewer Lepidoptera and more Orthoptera. Regardless of habitat, adult house wrens provide nestlings with similar types of foods, but other factors, such as quantity or quality of prey delivered, may lead to fitness disparities between urban and rural nestlings."
https://openalex.org/W4214539908,"Non-fatal traffic accidents may give rise to mental health problems, including posttraumatic stress (PTS) and depression. Clinical evidence suggests that victims may also experience grief reactions associated with the sudden changes and losses caused by such accidents. The aim of this study was to examine whether there are unique patterns of symptoms of PTS, depression, and grief among victims of non-fatal traffic accidents. We also investigated associations of emerging symptom patterns with sociodemographic variables and characteristics of the accident, and with transdiagnostic variables, including self-efficacy, difficulties in emotion regulation, and trauma rumination. Participants (N = 328, Mage = 32.6, SDage = 17.5 years, 66% female) completed self-report measures tapping the study variables. Using latent class analysis (including symptoms of PTS, depression, and grief), three classes were identified: a no symptoms class (Class 1; 59.1%), a moderate PTS and grief class (Class 2; 23.1%), and a severe symptoms class (Class 3; 17.7%). Summed symptom scores and functional impairment were lowest in Class 1, higher in Class 2, and highest in Class 3. Psychological variables were similarly ordered with the healthiest scores in Class 1, poorer scores in Class 2, and the worst scores in Class 3. Different sociodemographic and accident related variables differentiated between classes, including age, education, and time since the accident. In a regression including all significant univariate predictors, trauma rumination differentiated Class 2 from Class 1, all three psychological variables differentiated Class 3 from Class 1, and difficulties with emotion regulation and trauma rumination differentiated Class 3 from Class 2. This study demonstrates that most people respond resiliently to non-fatal traffic accident. Yet, approximately one in three victims experiences moderate to severe mental health symptoms. Increasing PTS coincided with similarly increasing grief, indicating that grief may be considered in interventions for victims of traffic accidents. Trauma rumination strongly predicted class membership and appears a critical treatment target to alleviate distress."

The objective of this study was to investigate if there is a relationship between skill level in the strategy video game Dota 2, a game that places many demands on decision making to be successful, and decision making under ambiguity and experience as measured by performance in the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), a task known to have ecological validity. Two indicators of players' performance in Dota 2, namely match-making rating (MMR) and Medal, were used as predictors of performance in the IGT in path models. Results showed that Medal was a significant predictor of performance in IGT, while MMR score was borderline significant. The cognitive reflection task, included in the models as an indicator of the ability to engage in conscious, analytical, rational, and logical thinking, was a significant predictor of performance in IGT, and was significantly and positively related to MMR. The findings from this study give insight into the cognitive demands related to performance in Dota 2. Although results suggest that strategy video gaming may be a factor that contributes to increased decision making abilities, a reversed relationship is also possible, whereby individuals who are better at decision making are also more likely to become successful in Dota-2. More studies, preferably longitudinal, are needed to replicate the findings of this study and to establish the directionality between factors."

However, the integrated effect of organic amendments and hydrological cycles on soil health indicators are not well understood. In this study, we quantified the impact of hemp residue (HR), hemp biochar (HB), and hardwood biochar (HA) on five hydrolytic enzymes, soil microbial phospholipid (PLFA) community structure, pH, permanganate oxidizable carbon (POXC) soil organic carbon (SOC), and total nitrogen (TN). We compared two soil types, Piedmont and Coastal Plain soils of North Carolina, under (i) a 30-d moisture cycle maintained at 60% water-filled pore space (WFPS) (D-W1), followed by (ii) a 7-day alternate dry-wet cycle for 42 days (D-W2), or (iii) maintained at 60% WFPS for 42 days (D-W3) during an aerobic laboratory incubation. Results showed that HR and HB significantly increased the geometric mean enzyme activity by 1-2-fold in the Piedmont soil under the three moisture cycles and about 1.5-fold under D-W in the Coastal soil. In the presence of HA, the measured soil enzyme activities were significantly lower than control under the moisture cycles in both soil types. The shift in microbial community structure was distinct in the Coastal soil but not in the Piedmont soil. Under D-W2, HR and HB significantly increased POXC (600-700 mg POXC kg-1 soil) in the Coastal soil but not in the Piedmont soil while HA increased nitrate (8 mg kg-1) retention in the Coastal soil. The differences in amendment effect on pH SOC, TN, POXC, and nitrate were less distinct in the fine-textured Piedmont soil than the coarse-textured Coastal soil. Overall, the results indicate that, unlike HA, HR and HB will have beneficial effects on soil health and productivity, therefore potentially improving soil's resilience to changing climate."
https://openalex.org/W4214695181,"Bacillus subtilis strain Ydj3 was applied to sweet peppers to understand the influence of this bacterium on the growth, fruit quality, and rhizosphere microbial composition of sweet pepper. The promotion of seed germination was observed for sweet pepper seeds treated with the Ydj3 strain, indicating that Ydj3 promoted seed germination and daily germination speed (131.5 ± 10.8 seeds/day) compared with the control (73.8 ± 2.5 seeds/day). Strain Ydj3 displayed chemotaxis toward root exudates from sweet pepper and could colonize the roots, which enhanced root hair growth. Following the one-per-month application of strain Ydj3 to sweet pepper grown in a commercial greenhouse, the yield, fruit weight, and vitamin C content significantly increased compared with those of the control. Additionally, the composition of the rhizosphere bacterial community of sweet pepper changed considerably, with the Bacillus genus becoming the most dominant bacterial genus in the treated group. These results suggested that B . subtilis Ydj3 promotes seed germination and enhances fruit quality, particularly the vitamin C content, of sweet pepper. These effects may be partly attributed to the B . subtilis Ydj3 colonization of sweet pepper roots due to Ydj3 chemotaxis toward root exudates, resulting in the modulation of the rhizosphere bacterial community."
https://openalex.org/W4214696346,"Calls to engage community leaders in preventing gender-based violence against women have gained global prominence in recent years. Situated within the growing calls for greater community leaders' engagement, this article problematizes the assumptions that efforts to mobilize community gatekeepers in violence prevention are likely to yield better results. Drawing inspiration from decolonial African feminist perspectives coupled with five focus group discussions conducted with 30 community leaders in the patriarchal setting of Northwestern Ghana, this article highlights the potential limitations of these assumptions by paying attention to the multiple ways; albeit subtly, in which community leaders as cultural gatekeepers may individually or collectively reproduce and sustain dominant cultural tropes that normalize violence against women. Our findings show that cultural gatekeepers' perspectives on and their approaches to addressing violence against women risk normalizing and perpetuating it. If policy makers, development practitioners, and researchers are to adequately address the violence of men, a useful starting point is to build on community leaders' perspectives, attitudes, and responses to violence as a collective issue. By building on these, we will be able to challenge and deconstruct the multiple ways in which community leaders' approaches to addressing violence are reinforcing gendered subordination."
https://openalex.org/W4214753592,"The disease burden and mortality related to Non-communicable Diseases (NCD) increased in the last couple of decades in Ethiopia. As a result, an estimated 300,000 deaths per annum were due to NCD. According to a World Health Organization report, 39% of the total deaths in Ethiopia were attributable to NCD. Rapid urbanization characterized by unhealthy lifestyles such as tobacco and/or alcohol use, physical inactivity, low fruits and vegetable consumption, and overweight drive the rising burden of NCD. However, studies on risk factors for NCD and associated variables are limited among working adults in Eastern Ethiopia. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the magnitude of the risk factors of NCD and associated factors among working adults in Eastern Ethiopia.A cross-sectional study was carried out among 1,200 working adults in Eastern Ethiopia that were selected using a simple random sampling technique from December 2018 to February 2019. Data were collected following the World Health Organization Stepwise Approach to NCD Risk Factor Surveillance (WHO STEP) instruments translated into the local language. A total of five risk factors were included in the study. The Negative Binomial Regression Model was used to determine the association between NCD risk factor scores and other independent variables. Adjusted incidence rate ratio (AIRR) with a 95% Confidence Interval (CI) was used to report the findings while the association was declared significant at a p-value of less than 0.05. STATA version 16.1 was used for data clearing, validating and statistical analysis.Totally, 1,164 (97% response rate) participants were employed for analysis. Overall, 95.8% (95% CI: 94.4-96.7%) of the participants had at least one of the five risk factors of NCD. Furthermore, the proportion of participants that had all NCD risk factors was 0.3%. Among the participants, 47.5% were alcohol drinkers, 5.1% were current smokers, 35.5% were overweight, 49.1% exercise low physical activity, and 95% had less than five portions of fruits and vegetables intake per day. Higher risk factor scores were associated with those of advanced age (AIRR = 1.24; 95% CI: 1.01-1.53 in 35-44 age group and AIRR = 1.28; 95% CI: 1.01-1.62 in 45-54 age group), and the ones who are higher educational level (AIRR = 1.23; 95% CI: 1.07-1.43 for those who have completed secondary school and AIRR = 1.29; 95% CI: 1.11-1.50 for those who have completed college education).The overwhelming majority (95.8%) of the participants had at least one risk factor for non-communicable diseases. The risk score of non-communicable diseases was higher among those with advanced age and who completed secondary and above levels of education. In a nutshell, the finding shows the need for lifestyle modification and comprehensive non-communicable diseases prevention programs for working adults in Eastern Ethiopia."
https://openalex.org/W4214520232,"A key issue in the spatial and temporal analysis of residential burglary is the choice of scale: spatial patterns might differ appreciably for different time periods and vary across geographic units of analysis. Based on point pattern analysis of burglary incidents in Columbus, Ohio during a 9-year period, this study develops an empirical framework to identify a useful spatial scale and its dependence on temporal aggregation. Our analysis reveals that residential burglary in Columbus clusters at a characteristic scale of 2.2 km. An ANOVA test shows no significant impact of temporal aggregation on spatial scale of clustering. This study demonstrates the value of point pattern analysis in identifying a scale for the analysis of crime patterns. Furthermore, the characteristic scale of clustering determined using our method has great potential applications: (1) it can reflect the spatial environment of criminogenic processes and thus be used to define the spatial boundary for place-based policing; (2) it can serve as a candidate for the bandwidth (search radius) for hot spot policing; (3) its independence of temporal aggregation implies that police officials need not be concerned about the shifting sizes of risk-areas depending on the time of the year."

However, dissemination and implementation of EBP remains problematic and is dependent on various external and internal factors, from personal through institutional to systemic, factors, with specific characteristics for different professions, contexts and settings. Knowledge, behaviours, attitudes, as well as facilitators and barriers towards EBP amongst physiotherapists, have been widely explored worldwide, but never in Poland. This study is part of a nationwide project, including dissemination actions addressing EBP in physiotherapists registered in Poland. Our purpose is to explore the issues of knowledge, behaviours, experiences, and attitudes of physiotherapists in Poland towards EBP. Descriptive research studies are warranted before analytical investigations and dissemination activities are conducted.We plan to conduct a quantitative, cross-sectional study-an online survey amongst the total population of physiotherapists registered in Poland to assess knowledge, behaviours and use of EBP (Study 1), and a qualitative study to allow physiotherapists to voice their opinions and to explore their experiences and attitudes towards EBP (Study 2). The EBP2 questionnaire, Polish validated translation, will be used for Study 1, in a web-based survey. A focus group approach will be applied for Study 2, with purposive sampling to achieve a representative picture of physiotherapists with respect to setting, specialty, seniority, educational degrees, and age. We will follow an inductive approach, using topics rather than questions.We will present the results of the studies separately, as typically presented in relevant study types: Study 1 will be reported addressing the domains and items of the EBP2, in relation to the independent variables, and Study 2 will be discussed using the themes and illustrative quotes analyses.We are aware that significant non-response, spin and Hawthorne effect may potentially bias our findings."
https://openalex.org/W4214644634,"Introduction Lower limb arthroplasty is successful at relieving symptoms associated with joint failure. However, physically-demanding activities can cause primary osteoarthritis and accordingly such exposure post-operatively might increase the risk of prosthetic failure. Therefore, we systematically reviewed the literature to investigate whether there was any evidence of increased risk of revision arthroplasty after exposure to intensive, physically-demanding activities at work or during leisure-time. Methods We searched Medline, Embase and Scopus databases (1985—July 2021) for original studies including primary lower limb arthroplasty recipients that gathered information on physically-demanding occupational and/or leisure activities and rates of revision arthroplasty. Methodological assessment was performed independently by two assessors using SIGN, AQUILA and STROBE. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO [CRD42017067728]. Results Thirteen eligible studies were identified: 9 (4,432 participants) after hip arthroplasty and 4 (7,137participants) after knee arthroplasty. Narrative synthesis was performed due to considerable heterogeneity in quantifying exposures. We found limited evidence that post-operative activities (work or leisure) did not increase the risk of knee revision and could even be protective. We found insufficient high-quality evidence to indicate that exposure to physically-demanding occupations increased the risk of hip revision although “heavy work”, agricultural work and, in women, health services work, may be implicated. We found conflicting evidence about risk of revision hip arthroplasty associated with either leisure-time or total physical activities (occupational or leisure-time). Conclusion There is currently a limited evidence base to address this important question. There is weak evidence that the risk of revision hip arthroplasty may be increased by exposure to physically-demanding occupational activities but insufficient evidence about the impact on knee revision and about exposure to leisure-time activities after both procedures. More evidence is urgently needed to advise lower limb arthroplasty recipients, particularly people expecting to return to jobs in some sectors (e.g., construction, agriculture, military)."
https://openalex.org/W4214649207,"Base flow, as an important component of runoff, is the main recharge source of runoff during the dry period, especially in the Yellow River Basin located in a semiarid area. However, the process of obtaining base flow has great uncertainty when considering hydrological simulations. Thus, in this study, a three-step framework is proposed, i.e., the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is used to calibrate model parameters under different subbasin partitioning schemes; then, the hydrograph separation (HYSEP), Improved United Kingdom Institute of Hydrology (IUKIH) and Lyne and Hollick filter (Lyne-Hollick) methods are used to separate the baseflow from the total runoff process, thereby exploring the uncertainty impacts of baseflow segmentation methods on the hydrological simulation process. The subsample-variance-decomposition method is used to quantify the independent and interactive uncertainty in the hydrological simulation process. The results show that the Topmodel model can be better applied to the source area of the Yellow River (the KGE values in the Sub5, Sub13, Sub21, Sub29, Sub37 and Sub13 scenarios were 0.91 and 0.65, 0.94 and 0.86, 0.94 and 0.88, 0.92 and 0.82, 0.95 and 0.89, and 0.92 and 0.83, respectively). The subbasin division uncertainty had less impact on simulated streamflow during the dry season and had a significant impact in the wet season, such as, the subbasin division uncertainty caused the difference between the median of the simulated streamflow to be as high as 213.09 m 3 /s in August but only 107.19 m 3 /s in January; Meanwhile, the baseflow segmentation method uncertainty has a significant impact on the annual mean streamflow values under different subbasin segmentation schemes. In addition, the baseflow values estimated by the Lyne-Hollick and HYSEP methods were obviously higher than those estimated by the IUKIH method during the wet season. The uncertainty influence of subbasin partitioning schemes and baseflow segmentation methods had significant differences on hydrological processes in different periods. The uncertainty influence of subbasin partitioning schemes was dominant in the dry season, accounting for 86%, and the baseflow segmentation methods took second place, accounting for approximately 12%. In the wet season, the uncertainty influence of the baseflow segmentation methods was gradually weakened, which may have been due to the uncertainty influence of the hydrological model. These results provide a reference for the calibration and validation of hydrological model parameters using baseflow components."

Thrap3 has been proved participating in various biological process, especially in the differentiation of stem cells. Here, we demonstrate that Thrap3 could promote osteogenesis through the inhibition of the degradation of Runx2, which is a key molecular structure in early osteoblast differentiation. Furthermore, we found that the osteogenesis enhancing capacity of Thrap3 was caused by physically binding with Sox9, inhibiting the transcriptional activity of Sox9, and then decreasing the decomposition-promoted effect of Sox9 on Runx2. Our data shows that Thrap3 promotes osteoblast differentiation through the Thrap3-Sox9-Runx2 axis. What we found may help for further clarifying the molecular mechanism of osteogenic differentiation and give a new potential therapeutic target for osteoporosis."
https://openalex.org/W4214488637,"Introduction Mycobacterial Interspersed Repetitive Units–Variable Tandem Repeats (MIRU-VNTR) typing has been widely used for molecular epidemiological studies of tuberculosis (TB). However, genotyping tools for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb ) may be limiting in some settings due to high cost and workload. In this study developed a customized stepwise MIRU-VNTR typing that prioritizes high discriminatory loci and validated this method using penitentiary system cohort in the country of Georgia. Methods We used a previously generated MIRU-VNTR dataset from recurrent TB cases (32 cases) in Georgia and a new dataset of TB cases from the penitentiary system (102 cases) recruited from 2014 to 2015. A Hunter-Gaston Discriminatory Index (HGDI) was calculated utilizing a 24 standard loci panel, to select high discriminatory power loci, subsequently defined as the customized Georgia-specific set of loci for initial typing. The remaining loci were scored and hierarchically grouped for second and third step typing of the cohort. We then compared the processing time and costs of the customized stepwise method to the standard 24-loci method. Results For the customized Georgia-specific set that was used for initial typing, 10 loci were selected with a minimum value of 0.32 to the highest HGDI score locus. Customized 10 loci (step 1) typing of 102 Mtb patient isolates revealed 35.7% clustered cases. This proportion was reduced to 19.5% after hierarchical application of 2 nd and 3 rd step typing with the corresponding groups of loci. Our customized stepwise MIRU-VNTR genotyping approach reduced the quantity of samples to be typed and therefore overall processing time and costs by 42.6% each. Conclusion Our study shows that our customized stepwise MIRU-VNTR typing approach is a valid alternative of standard MIRI-VNTR typing panels for molecular epidemiological investigation in Georgia that saves time, workload and costs. Similar approaches could be developed for other settings."
https://openalex.org/W4214497700,"Objective This study continues former studies on perinatal mortality in Japan after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant (FDNPP) accident in March 2011. An increased study region is chosen, and the study period is extended to 2019. Methods Japanese monthly perinatal mortality data are provided on a prefecture level by the Japanese government. The study region consists of 12 prefectures around the FDNPP; the rest of Japan is used as the control region. A combined non-linear regression of perinatal mortality rates in the study- and control regions is conducted. The regression model allows for a common asymptotic lower limit of perinatal mortality, seasonal variations, and periodic peaks in 2012–2019 in the study region. To determine the dependency of the effect on distance from the FDNPP, the study region is divided into four core prefectures and eight prefectures surrounding the core prefectures. Results Perinatal mortality rates in the study region show a significant 6.4% (95% CI: 1.8%, 13.4%) overall increase in 2012–2019 relative to the trend in preceding years with no attenuation during 2012–19. The increase translates to 590 (165, 1226) excess perinatal deaths (p = 0.016). It is characterized by annual peaks with maxima in April. A 13.6% increase is determined in the four core prefectures and a 4.3% increase in eight prefectures surrounding the core prefectures. Before 2012, there is a peak around April 2011 and a decline in October 2011; another significant peak is detected in November 2012. In the 4 core prefectures, large increases are found in the first quarter of 2018 (+70%) and in May 2019 (+130%). Conclusion This study finds periodic peaks in perinatal mortality in spring 2012–2019 in 12 prefectures of Japan surrounding the FDNPP. In light of massive increases in 2018 and 2019 in the four core prefectures, continued investigation of perinatal mortality in contaminated regions of Japan is recommended."
https://openalex.org/W4214534015,"Little is known about usual care by physicians and pharmacy teams to support adherence to statins and whether the extent of this care is associated with adherence to statins. Objective of the study was to examine the relationship between the extent of adherence supporting activities of healthcare practitioners (HCPs) and patients' adherence to statins.Cross-sectional study in 48 pharmacies and affiliated physicians' practices, between September 3, 2014 and March 20, 2015. Patients visiting the pharmacy with a statin prescription from participating prescribers were invited to participate. Usual care to support adherence was assessed among HCPs with the Quality of Standard Care questionnaire about usual care activities to support adherence. Adherence to statins was assessed among patients with the MARS-5 questionnaire. The association between the extent of HCPs' adherence supporting activities and patients' adherence was examined by means of multilevel regression analysis.1,504 patients and 692 HCPs (209 physicians, 118 pharmacists and 365 pharmacy technicians) participated. No association was found between the extent of physicians' adherence supporting activities and patients' adherence to statins. The extent of adherence supporting activities by pharmacy teams in usual care was negatively associated with patients' adherence to statins (B coefficient -0.057 (95%CI: -0.112- -0.002).This study suggests that there is no positive relationship between the extent of HCPs' adherence supporting activities in usual care and patients' adherence to statins. Other methods than questionnaires (e.g. electronic monitors (to assess adherence) and observations (to assess usual care) should be applied to confirm the results of this study."

https://openalex.org/W4221024017,"This study aimed to identify potential lateralization of bladder function. Electrical stimulation of spinal roots or the pelvic nerve’s anterior vesical branch was performed bilaterally in female dogs. The percent difference between the left and right stimulation-induced increased detrusor pressure was determined. Bladders were considered left or right-sided if differences were greater or less than 25% or 10%. Based on differences of 25%, upon stimulation of spinal roots, bladders were left-sided in 17/44 (38.6%), right-sided in 12/44 (27.2%) and bilateral in 15/44 (34.2%). Using ± 10%, 48% had left side dominance (n = 21/44), 39% had right side dominance (n = 17/44), and 14% were bilateral (n = 6/44). With stimulation of the pelvic nerve’s anterior vesical branch in 19 dogs, bladders were left-sided in 8 (42.1%), right-sided in 6 (31.6%) and bilateral in 5 (26.3%) using 25% differences and left side dominance in 8 (43%), right sided in 7 (37%) and bilateral in 4 (21%) using 10% differences. These data suggest lateralization of innervation of the female dog bladder with left- and right-sided lateralization occurring at similar rates. Lateralization often varied at different spinal cord levels within the same animal."
