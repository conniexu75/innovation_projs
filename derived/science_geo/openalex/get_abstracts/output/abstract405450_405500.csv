https://openalex.org/W2094280614,"Human embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells (hESCs/hiPSCs) are promising cell sources for cardiac regenerative medicine. To realize hESC/hiPSC-based cardiac cell therapy, efficient induction, purification, and transplantation methods for cardiomyocytes are required. Though marker gene transduction or fluorescent-based purification methods have been reported, fast, efficient and scalable purification methods with no genetic modification are essential for clinical purpose but have not yet been established. In this study, we attempted to identify cell surface markers for cardiomyocytes derived from hESC/hiPSCs.We adopted a previously reported differentiation protocol for hESCs based on high density monolayer culture to hiPSCs with some modification. Cardiac troponin-T (TNNT2)-positive cardiomyocytes appeared robustly with 30-70% efficiency. Using this differentiation method, we screened 242 antibodies for human cell surface molecules to isolate cardiomyocytes derived from hiPSCs and identified anti-VCAM1 (Vascular cell adhesion molecule 1) antibody specifically marked cardiomyocytes. TNNT2-positive cells were detected at day 7-8 after induction and 80% of them became VCAM1-positive by day 11. Approximately 95-98% of VCAM1-positive cells at day 11 were positive for TNNT2. VCAM1 was exclusive with CD144 (endothelium), CD140b (pericytes) and TRA-1-60 (undifferentiated hESCs/hiPSCs). 95% of MACS-purified cells were positive for TNNT2. MACS purification yielded 5-10×10(5) VCAM1-positive cells from a single well of a six-well culture plate. Purified VCAM1-positive cells displayed molecular and functional features of cardiomyocytes. VCAM1 also specifically marked cardiomyocytes derived from other hESC or hiPSC lines.We succeeded in efficiently inducing cardiomyocytes from hESCs/hiPSCs and identifying VCAM1 as a potent cell surface marker for robust, efficient and scalable purification of cardiomyocytes from hESC/hiPSCs. These findings would offer a valuable technological basis for hESC/hiPSC-based cell therapy."

To determine the biological substrates of PNPLA3 and the effect of the I148M substitution on enzymatic activity and substrate specificity, we purified and characterized recombinant human PNPLA3 and PNPLA3-I148M. Maximal hydrolytic activity of PNPLA3 was observed against the three major glycerolipids, TAG, diacylglycerol, and monoacylglycerol, with a strong preference for oleic acid as the acyl moiety. Substitution of methionine for isoleucine at position 148 markedly decreased the Vmax of the enzyme for glycerolipids but had only a modest effect on the Km. Purified PNPLA3 also catalyzed the hydrolysis of oleoyl-CoA, but the Vmax was 100-fold lower for oleoyl-CoA than for triolein. The thioesterase activity required the catalytic serine but was only modestly decreased by the I148M substitution. The enzyme had little or no hydrolytic activity against the other lipid substrates tested, including phospholipids, cholesteryl ester, and retinyl esters. Neither the wild-type nor mutant enzyme catalyzed transfer of oleic acid from oleoyl-CoA to glycerophosphate, lysophosphatidic acid, or diacylglycerol, suggesting that the enzyme does not promote de novo TAG synthesis. Taken together, our results are consistent with the notion that PNPLA3 plays a role in the hydrolysis of glycerolipids and that the I148M substitution causes a loss of function, although we cannot exclude the possibility that the enzyme has additional substrates or activities.

https://openalex.org/W2169563577,"In our in-depth analysis carried out by the Illumina Solexa massive parallel signature sequencing, microRNA-99a (miR-99a) was found to be the sixth abundant microRNA in the miRNome of normal human liver but was markedly down-regulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Compelling evidence has suggested the important roles of microRNAs in HCC development. However, the biological function of miR-99a deregulation in HCC remains unknown. In this study, we found that miR-99a was remarkably decreased in HCC tissues and cell lines. Importantly, lower miR-99a expression in HCC tissues significantly correlated with shorter survival of HCC patients, and miR-99a was identified to be an independent predictor for the prognosis of HCC patients. Furthermore, restoration of miR-99a dramatically suppressed HCC cell growth in vitro by inducing the G1 phase cell cycle arrest. Intratumoral injection of cholesterol-conjugated miR-99a mimics significantly inhibited tumor growth and reduced the α-fetoprotein level in HCC-bearing nude mice. Insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) were further characterized as the direct targets of miR-99a. Furthermore, protein levels of IGF-1R and mTOR were found to be inversely correlated with miR-99a expression in HCC tissues. miR-99a mimics inhibited IGF-1R and mTOR pathways and subsequently suppressed expression of cell cycle-related proteins, including cyclin D1 in HCC cells. Conclusively, miR-99a expression was frequently down-regulated in HCC tissues and correlates with the prognosis of HCC patients, thus proposing miR-99a as a prospective prognosis predictor of HCC. miR-99a suppresses HCC growth by inducing cell cycle arrest, suggesting miR-99a as potential tumor suppressor for HCC therapeutics.

https://openalex.org/W1980606681,"We describe a new algorithm, meraculous, for whole genome assembly of deep paired-end short reads, and apply it to the assembly of a dataset of paired 75-bp Illumina reads derived from the 15.4 megabase genome of the haploid yeast Pichia stipitis. More than 95% of the genome is recovered, with no errors; half the assembled sequence is in contigs longer than 101 kilobases and in scaffolds longer than 269 kilobases. Incorporating fosmid ends recovers entire chromosomes. Meraculous relies on an efficient and conservative traversal of the subgraph of the k-mer (deBruijn) graph of oligonucleotides with unique high quality extensions in the dataset, avoiding an explicit error correction step as used in other short-read assemblers. A novel memory-efficient hashing scheme is introduced. The resulting contigs are ordered and oriented using paired reads separated by ∼280 bp or ∼3.2 kbp, and many gaps between contigs can be closed using paired-end placements. Practical issues with the dataset are described, and prospects for assembling larger genomes are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2002613261,"Betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase (BHMT) uses betaine to catalyze the conversion of homocysteine (Hcy) to methionine. There are common genetic polymorphisms in the BHMT gene in humans that can alter its enzymatic activity. We generated the first Bhmt−/− mouse to model the functional effects of mutations that result in reduced BHMT activity. Deletion of Bhmt resulted in a 6-fold increase (p < 0.01) in hepatic and an 8-fold increase (p < 0.01) in plasma total Hcy concentrations. Deletion of Bhmt resulted in a 43% reduction in hepatic S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) (p < 0.01) and a 3-fold increase in hepatic S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy) (p < 0.01) concentrations, resulting in a 75% reduction in methylation potential (AdoMet:AdoHcy) (p < 0.01). Bhmt−/− mice accumulated betaine in most tissues, including a 21-fold increase in the liver concentration compared with wild type (WT) (p < 0.01). These mice had lower concentrations of choline, phosphocholine, glycerophosphocholine, phosphatidylcholine, and sphingomyelin in several tissues. At 5 weeks of age, Bhmt−/− mice had 36% lower total hepatic phospholipid concentrations and a 6-fold increase in hepatic triacyglycerol concentrations compared with WT (p < 0.01), which was due to a decrease in the secretion of very low density lipoproteins. At 1 year of age, 64% of Bhmt−/− mice had visible hepatic tumors. Histopathological analysis revealed that Bhmt−/− mice developed hepatocellular carcinoma or carcinoma precursors. These results indicate that BHMT has an important role in Hcy, choline, and one-carbon homeostasis. A lack of Bhmt also affects susceptibility to fatty liver and hepatocellular carcinoma. We suggest that functional polymorphisms in BHMT that significantly reduce activity may have similar effects in humans.

Humans have common single nucleotide polymorphisms in the BHMT gene that alter BHMT enzyme activity and function (1Feng Q. Kalari K. Fridley B.L. Jenkins G. Ji Y. Abo R. Hebbring S. Zhang J. Nye M.D. Leeder J.S. Weinshilboum R.M. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2011; 102: 126-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). A common BHMT single nucleotide polymorphism rs3733890 (41% of NC population has 1 variant allele, and 8% have 2 alleles (2da Costa K.A. Kozyreva O.G. Song J. Galanko J.A. Fischer L.M. Zeisel S.H. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 1336-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar)) was associated with increased risk for having babies with neural tube defects (3Boyles A.L. Billups A.V. Deak K.L.

The epidemiological evidence suggests the importance of single nucleotide polymorphisms in the gene. However, the metabolic consequences of having null mutations of the BHMT gene have not been thoroughly investigated. To directly investigate the role of BHMT in vivo, we generated and characterized mice in which the gene encoding Bhmt was deleted (Bhmt−/−). betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase methionine synthase cystathionine-β-synthase cystathionine-γ-lyase phosphatidylethanolamine methyltransferase glycine methyltransferase choline dehydrogenase homocysteine S-adenosylmethionine S-adenosylhomocysteine phosphatidylcholine phosphatidylethanolamine phosphocholine glycerophosphocholine phosphatidylinositol phosphatidylserine plasma urea nitrogen tetrahydrofolate nonesterified fatty acid triacylglycerol lactate dehydrogenase alanine transaminase creatinine kinase high density lipoprotein cholesterol very low density lipoprotein γ-glutamyltransferase 1 hepatocellular carcinoma. BHMT activity is found at high levels in the liver and kidney, and low levels in the brain, lenses, and other human tissues. In rodents, high levels of BHMT activity are only found in the liver (6Szegedi S.S. Castro C.C. Koutmos M. Garrow T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 8939-8945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Betaine, the methyl donor for BHMT, comes from either dietary sources or from oxidation of choline (an irreversible reaction) by choline dehydrogenase (CHDH). Alternatively, choline can be used to form the phospholipid phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) or the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (7Zeisel S.H. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2006; 26: 229-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). The product of BHMT, methionine, is the precursor for S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), the major methyl donor for most biological methylations, including DNA and histone methylation, the conversion of glycine to methylglycine (catalyzed by glycine methyltransferase (GNMT)), and the methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn) to form PtdCho (catalyzed by phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT)). The other substrate for BHMT is Hcy, a thiol-containing amino acid, which, when elevated in plasma, is associated with cardiovascular diseases, pregnancy complications, renal insufficiency, and cognitive impairment (8Pajares M.A. Pérez-Sala D. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2006; 63: 2792-2803Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Hcy is converted to methionine by BHMT or by methionine synthase, the latter of which uses methyltetrahydrofolate (methyl-THF) as the methyl donor (supplied by methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase) (9Selhub J. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1999; 19: 217-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar). Alternatively, Hcy is removed by the trans-sulfuration pathway, forming cystathionine and cysteine catalyzed by the enzymes cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine-γ-lyase (CγL), respectively (9Selhub J. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1999; 19: 217-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar). Both enzymes require vitamin B6; CBS also requires AdoMet as the allosteric activator (9Selhub J. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1999; 19: 217-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar). All the above pathways might be perturbed with the deletion of Bhmt. Here, we report on the metabolic phenotype of the first Bhmt knock-out mouse created. The gene targeting vector was designed to remove exons 6 and 7, the zinc-binding domains of the gene (Fig. 1A). The targeting vector was constructed by placing a MC1-neomycin (Neo) selectable marker flanked by 2 flippase (FLP) recognition target (FRT) sites and 1 locus of X-over P1 (loxP) site ∼330 bp downstream of exon 7. A second loxP site was introduced ∼240 bp upstream of exon 6. The vector was electroporated into E14Tg2A embryonic stem cells. Targeted cells were screened by PCR, confirmed by Southern blot analysis, and injected into blastocysts derived from mouse strain C57Bl/6 to create Bhmt transmitting chimeras. Neo deleted mice were generated by crossing the transmitting chimeras with Flpe deleters (number 003800, Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME), which expressed Flpe recombinase that recognized FRT sites and deleted the Neo cassette. Bhmt knock-out mice were generated by crossing the Neo deleted mice with Cre deleters (number 003724, Jackson Laboratory), which expressed Cre recombinase that recognized loxP sites and deleted exons 6 and 7. Bhmt knock-out mice were continuously backcrossed to C57Bl/6 mice. Generations F1 to F4 were used in this study. For all experiments, Bhmt+/+, Bhmt+/−, and Bhmt−/− littermates born of Bhmt+/− mating pairs were used to control the mixed genetic background. Mice were genotyped by PCR using TaKaRa Ex TaqDNA polymerase (TaKaRa Bio USA, Madison, WI) and the following primer sequences: Bhmt+/+ forward, 5′-GACTTTTAAAGAGTGGTGGTACATACCTTG-3′,Bhmt+/+ reverse, 5′-TCTCTCTGCAGCCACATCTGAACTTGTCTG-3′, Bhmt−/− forward, 5′-TTAACTCAACATCACAACAACAGATTTCAG-3′, Bhmt−/− reverse, 5′-TTGTCGACGGATCCATAACTTCGTATAAT-3′. PCR conditions were as follows: 94 °C for 2 min; 40 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 64 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 2 min; and 72 °C for 6 min. Bhmt+/+ PCR product was 1.6 kb in size, whereas Bhmt−/− was 545 bp (Fig. 1B). The animals were kept in a temperature-controlled environment at 24 °C and exposed to a 12-h light and dark cycle. All animals received AIN-76A pelleted diet with 1.1 g/kg choline chloride (Dyets, Bethlehem, PA). The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill approved all experimental protocols. Pairs of Bhmt+/+, Bhmt+/−, and Bhmt−/− parents were bred to assess their reproductive potential. Sizes, genotype distribution, and gender distribution of litters were recorded. Body weights and lengths (nose to hip, nose to tail) of Bhmt+/+, Bhmt+/−, and Bhmt−/− mice were measured from age 3.5 to 20 weeks old using a scale and a ruler, respectively. Eleven Bhmt+/+ and 14 Bhmt−/− mice were maintained over the course of a year to determine 1-year survival rates. Mice were anesthetized by inhalation of isoflurane (Hospira, Lake Forest, IL). Tissues were harvested, weighted, snap frozen, pulverized under liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until used. Western blot analysis of BHMT was performed in liver homogenate as previously described (10Delgado-Reyes C.V. Wallig M.A. Garrow T.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 393: 184-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). For all enzymatic assays, pulverized liver from 5-week-old mice were homogenized in buffer using a motorized tissue homogenizer (Talboys Engineering Corporation, Montrose, PA).

Mercaptopropinylglycine (10 μm) was used as an internal standard. Hepatic tHcy, cystathionine, methionine, cysteine, methylglycine, dimethylglycine, and glycine were measured as previously described (21Stabler S.P. Sekhar J. Allen R.H. O'Neill H.C. White C.W.

Plasma total folate was measured using Lactobacillus casei assay as previously described (22Horne D.W. Patterson D. Clin. Chem. 1988; 34: 2357-2359Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Concentrations of plasma urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine as well as activities of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alanine transaminase (ALT), and creatinine kinase (CK) were measured using an automatic chemical analyzer (Johnson and Johnson VT250, Rochester, NY) at the Animal Clinical Chemistry and Gene Expression Facility, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. Urine-specific gravity was measured using a refractometer (AO Instrument Co., Buffalo, NY) at the Department of Laboratory Animal Medicine Veterinary and Technical Services Facility, UNC, Chapel Hill. Plasma triacylglycerol (TAG), β-hydroxybutyrate (Stanbio, Boerme, TX), cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA), and glucose (Wako, Richmond, VA) were measured colorimetrically per the manufacturer's instructions. PtdCho, PtdEtn, phosphatidylserine (PtdSer), and phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) were extracted from the liver of 5-week-old mice using the Bligh and Dyer method (23Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J.

Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and measured colorimetrically as described above. 5-week-old animals were fasted for 4 h. 500 mg/kg body weight of Triton WR1339 (as a 7.5% solution dissolved in PBS) was injected retro-orbitally. Blood samples were taken using heparinized capillary tubes retro-orbitally at 2, 30, 60, and 120 min after Triton WR1339 injection for TAG measurement as an indicator of the secretion rate of the very low density lipoprotein (VLDL). Liver was harvested and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.2% gluteraldehyde for 48 h. Liver was processed, paraffin embedded, sectioned at 5 μm, and stained with hemotoxylin and eosin as previously described (27Lillie R. Histopathologic Technic and Practical Histochemistry. 3rd Ed.

For tumor analysis, whole liver was sectioned serially, and multiple sections per sample were examined by 2 veterinary pathologists from the Department of Laboratory Animal Medicine, UNC, Chapel Hill. High resolution images were collected using a Zeiss Axiovision A1 upright microscope. γGT1 levels were determined using ELISA (Cedarlane, Burlington, NC). Frozen liver samples from 1-year-old mice were homogenized in ice-cold PBS at pH 7.0 containing 10% protease inhibitors (Sigma) using an ultrasonic cell disruptor. The resulting suspension was centrifuged and protein levels were determined by the Lowry method (28Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Equal amounts of proteins were loaded onto the ELISA plate according to the manufacturer's protocol. The optical density was read at 450 nm on a Synergy 2 microplate reader (Biotek, VT). Statistical differences were determined using analysis of variance, Tukey-Kramer HSD, and Student's t test JMP version 6.0 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and reported as mean ± S.E. Bhmt−/− mice were generated using a cre/loxP system to delete exons 6 and 7, which contain the zinc-binding domain essential for BHMT activity. The mouse genotype was confirmed by PCR using genomic DNA (Fig. 1B). Bhmt−/− mice were also validated by assaying hepatic BHMT activity (Fig. 1C) and Western blot (Fig. 1D). Deletion of 1 allele of Bhmt resulted in a 46% reduction of activity, whereas deletion of both alleles resulted in the absence of activity. BHMT protein is predominantly found in mouse liver and was absent in Bhmt−/− liver. Mating pairs of Bhmt+/+, Bhmt+/−, and Bhmt−/− mice produced offspring with similar litter size (7.5 pups/litter) with evenly distributed genders. Bhmt+/− breeding pairs were used to generate littermates of Bhmt+/+, Bhmt+/−, and Bhmt−/− mice for all experiments. Bhmt+/− breeding pairs produced offspring at the expected Mendelian ratio, with 24.5% Bhmt+/+, 49.7% Bhmt+/−, and 25.8% Bhmt−/− mice. The Bhmt+/+ and Bhmt−/− mice appeared healthy and lived for at least 1 year. Body length and weight of pups were monitored from 3.5 to 20 weeks of age. There was no significant difference in body length among Bhmt+/+, Bhmt+/−, and Bhmt−/− mice (data not shown), and in body weight between Bhmt+/+ and Bhmt+/− mice (Fig. 1E). Bhmt−/− mice started with similar body weights as did Bhmt+/+ mice at weaning (3.5 weeks), but gained less weight between 5 and 9 weeks of age (p < 0.05). The weight difference did not persist after 9 weeks of age. Bhmt is predominantly found in the liver, however, complete deletion of Bhmt (Bhmt−/−) resulted in a substantial increase in concentrations of betaine in liver (by 21-fold; p < 0.001), kidney (by 5-fold; p < 0.001), heart (by 14-fold; p < 0.001), brain (by 5-fold; p < 0.001), muscle (by 12-fold; p < 0.001), adipose (by 2-fold; p < 0.001), lung (by 11-fold; p < 0.001), and plasma (by 16-fold; p < 0.001) compared with Bhmt+/+ mice (Table 1). Deletion of Bhmt resulted in reduced concentrations of choline in liver (by 82%; p < 0.01), kidney (by 38%; p < 0.01), heart (by 42%; p < 0.05), and adipose (by 53%; p < 0.01) compared with Bhmt+/+ mice. Deletion of Bhmt resulted in reduced concentrations of PtdCho in liver (by 26%; p < 0.01), kidney (by 21%; p < 0.05), heart (by 25%; p < 0.01), muscle (by 25%; p < 0.05), and plasma (by 31%; p < 0.001) compared with Bhmt+/+ mice. Deletion of Bhmt resulted in reduced concentrations of phosphocholine (PCho) in liver (by 72%; p < 0.01), heart (by 24%; p < 0.05), muscle (by 65%; p < 0.001), and adipose (by 68%; p < 0.01) compared with Bhmt+/+ mice. Deletion of Bhmt resulted in reduced concentrations of glycerophosphocholine (GPCho) in liver (p < 0.01), kidney (p < 0.05), heart (p < 0.001), adipose (p < 0.05), and lung (p < 0.01), as well as reduced concentrations of sphingomyelin in kidney (p < 0.05) and heart (p < 0.001) compared with Bhmt+/+ mice. In testis, there was no change in any choline metabolites in Bhmt−/− mice. Deletion of 1 copy of Bhmt (Bhmt+/−) resulted in choline metabolite concentrations in tissues similar to those of Bhmt+/+ mice (supplemental Table S1).TABLE 1Deletion of Bhmt results in altered choline metabolites in various tissuesBetaineCholineGPChoPChoPtdChoSphingomyelinLiver Bhmt+/+1,321 ± 254154 ± 361,730 ± 554294 ± 6715,897 ± 1,2001,018 ± 131 Bhmt−/−27,314 ± 2,001ap < 0.001 different from Bhmt+/+ by Student's t test.

https://openalex.org/W2024763965,"Progression from the androgen-sensitive to androgen-insensitive (or castration-resistant) stage is the major obstacle for sustained effectiveness of hormonal therapy for prostate cancer. The androgen receptor (AR) and its splice variants play important roles in regulating the transcription program essential for castration resistance. Here, we report the identification of a novel AR splice variant, designated as AR8, which is up-regulated in castration-resistant prostate cancer cells. AR8 is structurally different from other known AR splice variants because it lacks a DNA binding domain and therefore, unlikely functions as a transcription factor on its own. Immunofluorescence staining revealed that AR8 was primarily localized on the plasma membrane, possibly through palmitoylation of two cysteine residues within its unique C-terminal sequence. Mutation of these putative palmitoylation sites in AR8 led to loss of its plasma membrane localization. In addition, we demonstrated that overexpression of AR8 in prostate cancer cells promoted association of Src and AR with the EGF receptor in response to EGF treatment and enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of AR. Conversely, specific knockdown of AR8 expression in prostate cancer cells compromised EGF-induced Src activation and AR phosphorylation. This effect was accompanied with attenuation of proliferation and increased apoptosis in prostate cancer cells cultured in androgen-depleted medium. We also showed that AR8 was required for optimal transcriptional activity of AR in response to treatment of both androgen and EGF. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the membrane-associated AR8 isoform may contribute to castration resistance by potentiating AR-mediated proliferative and survival responses to hormones and growth factors."
https://openalex.org/W2046750712,"Members of the APOBEC3 (A3) family of cytidine deaminase enzymes act as host defense mechanisms limiting both infections by exogenous retroviruses and mobilization of endogenous retrotransposons. Previous studies revealed that the overexpression of some A3 proteins could restrict engineered human Long INterspersed Element-1 (LINE-1 or L1) retrotransposition in HeLa cells. However, whether endogenous A3 proteins play a role in restricting L1 retrotransposition remains largely unexplored. Here, we show that HeLa cells express endogenous A3B and A3C, whereas human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) express A3B, A3C, A3DE, A3F, and A3G. To study the relative contribution of endogenous A3 proteins in restricting L1 retrotransposition, we first generated small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) to suppress endogenous A3 mRNA expression, and then assessed L1 mobility using a cell-based L1 retrotransposition assay. We demonstrate that in both HeLa and hESCs, shRNA-based knockdown of A3B promotes a ∼2-3.7-fold increase in the retrotransposition efficiency of an engineered human L1. Knockdown of the other A3s produced no significant increase in L1 activity. Thus, A3B appears to restrict engineered L1 retrotransposition in a broad range of cell types, including pluripotent cells."
https://openalex.org/W2078930759,"An outstanding problem in cancer therapy is the battle against treatment-resistant disease. This is especially true for ovarian cancer, where the majority of patients eventually succumb to treatment-resistant metastatic carcinomatosis. Limited perfusion and diffusion, acidosis, and hypoxia play major roles in the development of resistance to the majority of front-line therapeutic regimens. To overcome these limitations and eliminate otherwise spared cancer cells, we utilized the cationic photosensitizer EtNBS to treat hypoxic regions deep inside in vitro 3D models of metastatic ovarian cancer. Unlike standard regimens that fail to penetrate beyond ∼150 µm, EtNBS was found to not only penetrate throughout the entirety of large (>200 µm) avascular nodules, but also concentrate into the nodules' acidic and hypoxic cores. Photodynamic therapy with EtNBS was observed to be highly effective against these hypoxic regions even at low therapeutic doses, and was capable of destroying both normoxic and hypoxic regions at higher treatment levels. Imaging studies utilizing multiphoton and confocal microscopies, as well as time-lapse optical coherence tomography (TL-OCT), revealed an inside-out pattern of cell death, with apoptosis being the primary mechanism of cell killing. Critically, EtNBS-based photodynamic therapy was found to be effective against the model tumor nodules even under severe hypoxia. The inherent ability of EtNBS photodynamic therapy to impart cytotoxicity across a wide range of tumoral oxygenation levels indicates its potential to eliminate treatment-resistant cell populations."
https://openalex.org/W2138290270,"Sequences of the novel gammaretrovirus, xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV) have been described in human prostate cancer tissue, although the amounts of DNA are low. Furthermore, XMRV sequences and polytropic (p) murine leukemia viruses (MLVs) have been reported in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). In assessing the prevalence of XMRV in prostate cancer tissue samples we discovered that eluates from naïve DNA purification columns, when subjected to PCR with primers designed to detect genomic mouse DNA contamination, occasionally gave rise to amplification products. Further PCR analysis, using primers to detect XMRV, revealed sequences derived from XMRV and pMLVs from mouse and human DNA and DNA of unspecified origin. Thus, DNA purification columns can present problems when used to detect minute amounts of DNA targets by highly sensitive amplification techniques."
https://openalex.org/W2030343535,"There is accumulating evidence that the activation of spinal glial cells, especially microglia, is a key event in the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain. However, the inhibition of microglial activation is often ineffective, especially for long-lasting persistent neuropathic pain. So far, neuropathic pain remains largely intractable and a new therapeutic strategy for the pain is still required.Using Seltzer model mice, we investigated the temporal aspect of two types of neuropathic pain behaviors, i.e., thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia, as well as that of morphological changes in spinal microglia and astrocytes by immunohistochemical studies. Firstly, we analyzed the pattern of progression in the pain behaviors, and found that the pain consisted of an ""early induction phase"" and subsequent ""late maintenance phase"". We next analyzed the temporal changes in spinal glial cells, and found that the induction and the maintenance phase of pain were associated with the activation of microglia and astrocytes, respectively. When Bushi, a Japanese herbal medicine often used for several types of persistent pain, was administered chronically, it inhibited the maintenance phase of pain without affecting the induction phase, which was in accordance with the inhibition of astrocytic activation in the spinal cord. These analgesic effects and the inhibition of astrocytic activation by Bushi were mimicked by the intrathecal injection of fluorocitrate, an inhibitor of astrocytic activation. Finally, we tested the direct effect of Bushi on astrocytic activation, and found that Bushi suppressed the IL-1β- or IL-18-evoked ERK1/2-phosphorylation in cultured astrocytes but not the ATP-evoked p38- and ERK1/2-phosphorylation in microglia in vitro.Our results indicated that the activation of spinal astrocytes was responsible for the late maintenance phase of neuropathic pain in the Seltzer model mice and, therefore, the inhibition of astrocytic activation by Bushi could be a useful therapeutic strategy for treating neuropathic pain."

Production of mature RNAs in eukaryotes requires a complex set of processing steps, including 5′-end capping, splicing, 3′-end cleavage, polyadenylation, nucleolytic cleavage/trimming, and base modifications, by numerous processing components. Incorrectly processed RNAs are rapidly degraded by RNA quality control machinery to prevent deleterious effects on the cell. Processing and degradation of multiple classes of RNA are performed by RNA endo/exoribonucleases that are recruited to their RNA substrates by specific protein cofactors. These nucleases and their cofactors are highly regulated and evolutionarily conserved.

Importantly, exosome depletion from human cells has revealed the presence of short, polyadenylated, unstable RNAs arising upstream (∼1 kb) of promoters, termed promoter upstream transcripts, indicating that exosome-targeted degradation of such ncRNAs is conserved in humans (20Preker P.

In S. cerevisiae, the nuclear exosome is recruited to ncRNAs and aberrant RNAs through the evolutionarily conserved Trf4/5-Air1/2-Mtr4 polyadenylation (TRAMP) complex, a cofactor and critical RNA surveillance component that adds a short poly(A) tail to RNA substrates and promotes their degradation by stimulating the exonucleolytic activity of the exosome (13Kadaba S.

An outstanding question in nuclear RNA surveillance is how the TRAMP complex can recognize its RNA substrates and distinguish between “good” properly processed and “bad” incorrectly processed RNA. Characterizing the putative RNA-binding proteins, Air1 and Air2, is thus paramount.

Unlike Pap1, which processively adds 70–90 adenosines to an RNA substrate, Trf4, in the context of TRAMP4, distributively adds a short poly(A) tail to an RNA substrate (21LaCava J. Houseley J.

Mutations in TRF4 and RRP44 stabilize unstable hypomodified tRNAiMet that lacks a methyl group in cells with a defective tRNA methyltransferase, and Trf4 overexpression causes polyadenylation of this hypomodified, but not wild type, tRNAiMet in these mutant cells, indicating that Trf4 polyadenylates and marks hypomodified tRNAiMet for degradation by the exosome (13Kadaba S. Krueger A. Trice T. Krecic A.M. Hinnebusch A.G. Anderson J. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1227-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Critically, budding yeast-derived TRAMP4 complex or recombinant Trf4-Air1/2 complex exclusively polyadenylates hypomodified tRNAiMet, suggesting that the TRAMP4 complex recognizes the structure/folding of an RNA substrate (22Vanácová S.

Besides aberrant tRNAs, Trf4 also polyadenylates and stimulates the degradation of snRNAs, snoRNAs, rRNAs, and CUT RNAs, including the prototypic CUT, NEL025c (14Wyers F. Rougemaille M. Badis G.

A recent crystal structure of Trf4 in complex with an Air2 fragment shows that Air2 zinc knuckles 4 and 5 interact with the Trf4 central domain (49Hamill S. Wolin S.L. Reinisch K.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 15045-15050Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In addition, recombinant Trf4 in complex with Air2 ZnK1–5 preferentially polyadenylates aberrant tRNA in vitro, indicating that Air2 zinc knuckles can also recognize RNA (49Hamill S. Wolin S.L. Reinisch K.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 15045-15050Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). A key question is therefore which zinc knuckles of the Air1/2 proteins contribute to RNA recognition and Air protein function in vivo. At present, studies of Air zinc knuckle function have only been carried out in vitro using recombinant protein, and only mutants of ZnK1, ZnK2, and ZnK3 have been generated in the context of Air2 ZnK1–5 (49Hamill S. Wolin S.L. Reinisch K.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 15045-15050Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Trf4 complexed with an Air2 ZnK1 mutant, but not a ZnK2 or ZnK3 mutant, exhibits impaired polyadenylation of mutant tRNA, suggesting that Air2 ZnK1 is important for RNA recognition (49Hamill S. Wolin S.L. Reinisch K.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 15045-15050Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). An Air2 ZnK4-5 fragment also supports weak Trf4-mediated polyadenylation of aberrant tRNA, indicating that ZnK4 and ZnK5 also have the capacity to recognize RNA (49Hamill S. Wolin S.L. Reinisch K.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 15045-15050Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, these conclusions are all based on biochemical experiments, and the contributions of the individual zinc knuckles to the in vivo function of the Air proteins have not been addressed. Here, we present the first in vivo functional analysis of full-length Air1/2 zinc knuckle 1–5 mutants. We find that Air1/2 ZnK4 and ZnK5 are functionally important. In particular, Air1/2 ZnK4 and ZnK5 mutants exhibit temperature-sensitive growth and reduced binding to Trf4. In addition, air1 ZnK4 mutant cells exhibit the highest levels of NEL025c CUT RNA relative to AIR1 cells and the other air1 ZnK mutants, suggesting that Air1 ZnK4 may help facilitate RNA recognition. We also find that Air1/2 and Trf4, but not Trf5 or Mtr4, suppress the temperature-sensitive growth of the air1 ZnK5 mutant. In addition, Air1 interaction with Trf4 and Air1 level are critical for the stability of TRAMP complex components and the integrity of the TRAMP complex. Importantly, our studies also identify a key evolutionarily conserved IWRXY motif in the Air1 ZnK4-5 linker region that is important for Air1 function and interaction with Trf4. A putative human orthologue of the Air proteins, hZCCHC7, which contains the IWRXY motif, localizes to the nucleolus and binds to both mammalian Trf4-like proteins, PAPD5 and PAPD7, providing evidence that hZCCHC7 is the Air protein component of a human TRAMP complex. Together, the data suggest that Air1/2 interacts with Trf4 predominantly via the ZnK4-5 linker and ZnK5 and facilitates recognition of RNA via ZnK1–4. All DN"
https://openalex.org/W1967395613,"Copper is an essential plant micronutrient playing key roles in cellular processes, among them photosynthesis. In Arabidopsis thaliana, copper delivery to chloroplasts, mainly studied by genetic approaches, is thought to involve two P(IB)-type ATPases: AtHMA1 and AtHMA6/PAA1. The lack of biochemical characterization of AtHMA1 and PAA1, and more generally of plant P(IB)-type ATPases, is due to the difficulty of getting high amounts of these membrane proteins in an active form, either from their native environment or after expression in heterologous systems. In this study, we report the first biochemical characterization of PAA1, a plant copper-transporting ATPase. PAA1 produced in Lactococcus lactis is active, forming an aspartyl phosphate intermediate in the presence of ATP and the adequate metal ion. PAA1 can also be phosphorylated using inorganic phosphate in the absence of transition metal. Both phosphorylation types allowed us to demonstrate that PAA1 is activated by monovalent copper ions (and to a lower extent by silver ions) with an apparent affinity in the micromolar range. In agreement with these biochemical data, we also demonstrate that when expressed in yeast, PAA1 induces increased sensitivities to copper and silver. These data provide the first enzymatic characterization of a P(IB-1)-type plant ATPase and clearly identify PAA1 as a high affinity Cu(I) transporter of the chloroplast envelope."

The cellular function and regulation of human KIBRA remain largely unclear. Here, we show that KIBRA is a phosphoprotein and that phosphorylation of KIBRA is regulated in a cell cycle-dependent manner with the highest level of phosphorylated KIBRA detected in mitosis. We further demonstrate that the mitotic kinases Aurora-A and -B phosphorylate KIBRA both in vitro and in vivo. We identified the highly conserved Ser539 as the primary phosphorylation site for Aurora kinases. Moreover, we found that wild-type, but not catalytically inactive, protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) associates with KIBRA. PP1 dephosphorylated Aurora-phosphorylated KIBRA. KIBRA depletion impaired the interaction between Aurora-A and PP1. We also show that KIBRA associates with neurofibromatosis type 2/Merlin in a Ser539 phosphorylation-dependent manner. Phosphorylation of KIBRA on Ser539 plays a role in mitotic progression. Our results suggest that KIBRA is a physiological substrate of Aurora kinases and reveal a new avenue between KIBRA/Hippo signaling and the mitotic machinery.

The lysates were treated or not with 400 units (1 μl) of λ-phosphatase (P0753, New England Biolabs) in the presence of 1 mm MnCl2 at 30 °C for 30 min. A mixed solution of 10 mm sodium orthovanadate and 50 mm sodium fluoride was used as a λ-phosphatase inhibitor. The reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer followed by 5 min of heating at 95 °C. Truncated forms of KIBRA were subcloned in-frame into the pGEX-5X-1 vector (Novagen). The GST-tagged proteins were bacterially expressed and purified on GSTrap FF affinity columns (GE Healthcare) following the manufacturer's instructions. To make His-tagged human Aurora-A kinase, full-length Aurora-A was subcloned into pET-21c vector (Novagen), and proteins were expressed and purified as described (52Tsai M.Y. Wiese C. Cao K. Martin O. Donovan P. Ruderman J. Prigent C. Zheng Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). His-tagged Xenopus Aurora-A and kinase-inactive proteins were purified as described (53Sessa F. Mapelli M. Ciferri C. Tarricone C. Areces L.B. Schneider T.R. Stukenberg P.T. Musacchio A. Mol.

Khorasanizadeh S. Stukenberg P.T. Science. 2008; 319: 469-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). 1–2 μg of GST-KIBRA was incubated with 0.5–1 μg of active recombinant Aurora kinase in kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), and 100 μm ATP) in the presence of 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The reaction was carried out at 30 °C for 30 min and stopped by the addition of SDS loading buffer. The samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto PVDF (Millipore), and visualized by autoradiography followed by Western blot analysis. GST-KIBRA-M was first phosphorylated by Aurora-A in vitro as described above. Phosphorylated GST-KIBRA-M was pulled down by glutathione-agarose (SC-2009, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and extensively washed with Nonidet P-40 buffer. The washed beads were then resuspended in Nonidet P-40 buffer and split into tubes containing 1 mm MnCl2, 1 mm DTT (final concentration), and appropriate protein phosphatases or BSA as a negative control. For inhibitor-2 treatment, 2.5 units of inhibitor-2 were added. The reaction was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. The beads and supernatant were carefully separated by centrifugation. The relative amounts of 32P released into the supernatant and the 32P bound to GST-KIBRA-M were quantified by liquid scintillation counting (Beckman). PP1 (P0754) and protein phosphatase inhibitor-2 (P0755) were purchased from New England Biolabs. PP2A (539508) was from Calbiochem. Statistical significance was determined using a two-tailed, unpaired Student's t test. In most cases, KIBRA runs as a doublet or as multiple bands on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 1A and data not shown) (34Hilton H.N. Stanford P.M. Harris J. Oakes S.R. Kaplan W. Daly R.J. Ormandy C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1783: 383-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). λ-Phosphatase treatment converted all the higher molecular weight protein bands to the faster migrating form, suggesting that the electrophoretic upshift of KIBRA is caused by post-translational phosphorylation (Fig. 1A). The KIBRA phosphorylation is not specific to cancer cells as it is also evident in HEK293T cells (Fig. 1A, lanes 7 and 8). Metabolic labeling with 32P confirmed that transfected FLAG-tagged KIBRA is also phosphorylated (Fig. 1B). KIBRA associates with Lats1 and Lats2 (39Xiao L. Chen Y. Ji M. Dong J. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 7788-7796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), which are both phosphorylated by mitotic kinases during mitosis (55Morisaki T. Hirota T. Iida S. Marumoto T. Hara T. Nishiyama Y. Kawasuzi M. Hiraoka T. Mimori T. Araki N. Izawa I. Inagaki M. Saya H. FEBS Lett. 2002; 529: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 56Toji S. Yabuta N. Hosomi T. Nishihara S. Kobayashi T. Suzuki S. Tamai K. Nojima H. Genes Cells. 2004; 9: 383-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). To test whether KIBRA phosphorylation is also regulated by the cell cycle, we arrested cells in S and G2/M phases by thymidine and nocodazole, respectively. Interestingly, KIBRA was further upshifted in both HeLa and MCF-7 cells synchronized at G2/M phase, suggesting that KIBRA is hyperphosphorylated in nocodazole-arrested mitotic cells (Fig. 1C). Increased phosphorylation of H3 Ser10 and removal of inhibitory phosphorylation at Tyr15 of Cdc2 are both well known characteristics of cells in mitosis. To further examine the phosphorylation status of KIBRA during cell cycle progression under more physiological conditions, we performed double thymidine synchronization in HeLa cells (51Hirota T. Kunitoku N. Sasayama T. Marumoto T. Zhang D. Nitta M. Hatakeyama K. Saya H. Cell. 2003; 114: 585-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Mitotic entry peaked at 8–12 h following thymidine release in these cells as judged by increased cyclin B expression and phospho-H3 Ser10 levels, coinciding with the highest phosphorylation level (judged by mobility upshift) on endogenous KIBRA (Fig. 1D). Taken together, these data suggest that KIBRA is phosphorylated in both unperturbed and nocodazole-arrested mitotic cells. Next, we set out to determine the corresponding kinase(s) involved in KIBRA phosphorylation. Several kinases are activated during mitosis (41Nigg E.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar). Among them, the members of the Aurora kinase family play critical roles in controlling mitosis (40Bischoff J.R. Plowman G.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 454-459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 41Nigg E.A. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Cell. 2003; 114: 585-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). To test whether KIBRA phosphorylation in mitosis is caused by activated Aurora kinases, we treated the nocodazole-arrested cells with VX680, an Aurora-A and -B inhibitor, and analyzed the mobility shift of endogenous KIBRA. As shown in Fig. 1E, inhibition of Aurora kinases largely abolished the upshift of KIBRA caused by nocodazole treatment, indicating that phosphorylation of KIBRA in mitosis is Aurora kinase-dependent. Furthermore, WT Aurora-A and -B upshifted KIBRA, and the kinase-inactive forms (KD) greatly increased the mobility of KIBRA when they were overexpressed (Fig. 1F), implying a potential link between Aurora kinases and KIBRA phosphorylation. To determine whether Aurora kinases can directly phosphorylate KIBRA, we performed in vitro kinase assays with truncated GST-tagged KIBRA forms (-N, -M, and -C) as substrates (Fig. 2A). Fig. 2B shows that purified Aurora-A kinase strongly phosphorylates the middle part of KIBRA (GST-KIBRA-M; amino acids 428–835) with no phosphorylation detected in the N terminus and mild phosphorylation detected in the C terminus (Fig. 2B). Although WT Aurora kinase robustly phosphorylates KIBRA, no phosphorylation was detected when Aurora-KD was used in the kinase assays (Fig. 2C). As expected, addition of VX680 also greatly inhibited phosphorylation of KIBRA even in the presence of WT Aurora kinase (Fig. 2C), further confirming the specificity. The electrophoretic mobility of GST-KIBRA-M was greatly retarded upon phosphorylation (Fig. 2C, compare lane 2 with lanes 1, 3, and 4). The upshift of GST-KIBRA-M is also evident in other kinase assays (Fig. 2, B and D). Aurora-A and Aurora-B kinases are structurally similar with a conserved C-terminal kinase domain (40Bischoff J.R. Plowman G.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 454-459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 57Carmena M. Earnshaw W.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003"
https://openalex.org/W2065712244,"Emerging resistance of human pathogens to anti-infective agents make it necessary to develop new agents to treat infection. The methylerythritol phosphate pathway has been identified as an anti-infective target, as this essential isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway is widespread in human pathogens but absent in humans. The first enzyme of the pathway, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate (DXP) synthase, catalyzes the formation of DXP via condensation of D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (D-GAP) and pyruvate in a thiamine diphosphate-dependent manner. Structural analysis has revealed a unique domain arrangement suggesting opportunities for the selective targeting of DXP synthase; however, reports on the kinetic mechanism are conflicting. Here, we present the results of tryptophan fluorescence binding and kinetic analyses of DXP synthase and propose a new model for substrate binding and mechanism. Our results are consistent with a random sequential kinetic mechanism, which is unprecedented in this enzyme class."
https://openalex.org/W1993942652,"Mucosal transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) results in a bottleneck in viral genetic diversity. Gnanakaran and colleagues used a computational strategy to identify signature amino acids at particular positions in Envelope that were associated either with transmitted sequences sampled very early in infection, or sequences sampled during chronic infection. Among the strongest signatures observed was an enrichment for the stable presence of histidine at position 12 at transmission and in early infection, and a recurrent loss of histidine at position 12 in chronic infection. This amino acid lies within the leader peptide of Envelope, a region of the protein that has been shown to influence envelope glycoprotein expression and virion infectivity. We show a strong association between a positively charged amino acid like histidine at position 12 in transmitted/founder viruses with more efficient trafficking of the nascent envelope polypeptide to the endoplasmic reticulum and higher steady-state glycoprotein expression compared to viruses that have a non-basic position 12 residue, a substitution that was enriched among viruses sampled from chronically infected individuals. When expressed in the context of other viral proteins, transmitted envelopes with a basic amino acid position 12 were incorporated at higher density into the virus and exhibited higher infectious titers than did non-signature envelopes. These results support the potential utility of using a computational approach to examine large viral sequence data sets for functional signatures and indicate the importance of Envelope expression levels for efficient HIV transmission."

However, previous studies had not considered more physiologically relevant temperature elevation associated with febrile hyperthermia. In this report we examine the response of GRP78/BiP and other components of the ER stress pathway in cells exposed to 40°C.AD293 cells were exposed to 43°C heat shock to confirm inhibition of the ER stress response genes. Five mammalian cell types, including AD293 cells, were then exposed to 40°C hyperthermia for various time periods and induction of the ER stress pathway was assessed.The inhibition of the ER stress pathway by heat shock (43°C) was confirmed. In contrast cells subjected to more mild temperature elevation (40°C) showed either a partial or full ER stress pathway induction as determined by downstream targets of the three arms of the ER stress pathway as well as a heat shock response. Cells deficient for Perk or Gcn2 exhibit great sensitivity to ER stress induction by hyperthermia.The ER stress pathway is induced partially or fully as a consequence of hyperthermia in parallel with induction of Hsp70. These findings suggest that the ER and cytoplasm of cells contain parallel pathways to coordinately regulate adaptation to febrile hyperthermia associated with disease or infection."

We show that it is possible to significantly truncate both the N and C termini of the B-chain while still retaining potent biological activity. This suggests that these regions are not critical for interactions with the H2 relaxin receptor, RXFP1. In contrast, truncations do reduce the activity of H2 relaxin for the related receptor RXFP2 by improving RXFP1 selectivity.

https://openalex.org/W1993267239,"Class I MAGE proteins (MAGE I) are normally expressed only in developing germ cells but are aberrantly expressed in many cancers. They have been shown to promote tumor survival, aggressive growth, and chemoresistance but the underlying mechanisms and MAGE I functions have not been fully elucidated. KRAB domain zinc finger transcription factors (KZNFs) are the largest group of vertebrate transcription factors and regulate neoplastic transformation, tumor suppression, cellular proliferation, and apoptosis. KZNFs bind the KAP1 protein and direct KAP1 to specific DNA sequences where it suppresses gene expression by inducing localized heterochromatin characterized by histone 3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3me3K9). Discovery that MAGE I proteins also bind to KAP1 prompted us to investigate whether MAGE I can affect KZNF and KAP1 mediated gene regulation. We found that expression of MAGE I proteins, MAGE-A3 or MAGE-C2, relieved repression of a reporter gene by ZNF382, a KZNF with tumor suppressor activity. ChIP of MAGE I (-) HEK293T cells showed KAP1 and H3me3K9 are normally bound to the ID1 gene, a target of ZNF382, but that binding is greatly reduced in the presence of MAGE I proteins. MAGE I expression relieved KAP1 mediated ID1 repression, causing increased expression of ID1 mRNA and ID1 chromatin relaxation characterized by loss of H3me3K9. MAGE I binding to KAP1 also induced ZNF382 poly-ubiquitination and degradation, consistent with loss of ZNF382 leading to decreased KAP1 binding to ID1. In contrast, MAGE I expression caused increased KAP1 binding to Ki67, another KAP1 target gene, with increased H3me3K9 and decreased Ki67 mRNA expression. Since KZNFs are required to direct KAP1 to specific genes, these results show that MAGE I proteins can differentially regulate members of the KZNF family and KAP1 mediated gene repression."
https://openalex.org/W1987888973,"Chemokine receptors play a major role in immune system regulation and have consequently been targets for drug development leading to the discovery of several small molecule antagonists. Given the large size and predominantly extracellular receptor interaction of endogenous chemokines, small molecules often act more deeply in an allosteric mode. However, opposed to the well described molecular interaction of allosteric modulators in class C 7-transmembrane helix (7TM) receptors, the interaction in class A, to which the chemokine receptors belong, is more sparsely described. Using the CCR5 chemokine receptor as a model system, we studied the molecular interaction and conformational interchange required for proper action of various orthosteric chemokines and allosteric small molecules, including the well known CCR5 antagonists TAK-779, SCH-C, and aplaviroc, and four novel CCR5 ago-allosteric molecules. A chimera was successfully constructed between CCR5 and the closely related CCR2 by transferring all extracellular regions of CCR2 to CCR5, i.e. a Trojan horse that resembles CCR2 extracellularly but signals through a CCR5 transmembrane unit. The chimera bound CCR2 (CCL2 and CCL7), but not CCR5 chemokines (CCL3 and CCL5), with CCR2-like high affinities and potencies throughout the CCR5 signaling unit. Concomitantly, high affinity binding of small molecule CCR5 agonists and antagonists was retained in the transmembrane region. Importantly, whereas the agonistic and antagonistic properties were preserved, the allosteric enhancement of chemokine binding was disrupted. In summary, the Trojan horse chimera revealed that orthosteric and allosteric sites could be structurally separated and still act together with transmission of agonism and antagonism across the different receptor units."

We used CLL samples with discordant VLA-4/CD38 risk to address their individual roles in human bone marrow infiltration (BM), CLL cell homing to murine BM, and in supportive CLL cell-stromal cell interactions.VLA-4, CD38, and Ki-67 expression was measured in CLL cells from peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) aspirates. CLL BM infiltration rates, routinely determined by Pathology, were correlated to VLA-4 and CD38 expression. Short-term homing capacity of CLL cells was evaluated by adoptive transfer experiments. CLL cell viability and adhesion in stromal cell co-culture was determined.About 20% of CLL samples in our cohort displayed discordant VLA-4 and CD38 risk, with either high VLA-4 and low CD38 risk or vice versa. Using particularly such samples, we observed that VLA-4, and not CD38, was responsible for recirculation of CLL cells to murine BM. Human BM infiltration was also significantly higher in patients with high VLA-4 risk but not high CD38 risk. However, both molecules acted as independent prognostic markers. While both VLA-4 and CD38 expression were increased in BM-derived CLL cells, and VLA-4+ and CD38+ subpopulations showed enriched Ki-67 expression, VLA-4 did not contribute to CLL cell protection by stromal cells in vitro.Our data argue for a prominent role of VLA-4 but not CD38 expression in the homing of CLL cells to BM niches and in human BM infiltration, but only a limited role in their protection by stromal cells."
https://openalex.org/W2099820942,"Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) has been reported to modulate angiogenesis, the process of new blood vessel formation, by promoting proliferation, migration and tube formation of endothelial cells. Endothelial progenitor cells are known as a subset of circulating bone marrow mononuclear cells that have the capacity to differentiate into endothelial cells. However, the mechanism underlying the stimulatory effects of PGE2 and its specific receptors on bone marrow-derived cells (BMCs) in angiogenesis has not been fully characterized. Treatment with PGE2 significantly increased the differentiation and migration of BMCs. Also, the markers of differentiation to endothelial cells, CD31 and von Willebrand factor, and the genes associated with migration, matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9, were significantly upregulated. This upregulation was abolished by dominant-negative AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and AMPK inhibitor but not protein kinase, a inhibitor. As a functional consequence of differentiation and migration, the tube formation of BMCs was reinforced. Along with altered BMCs functions, phosphorylation and activation of AMPK and endothelial nitric oxide synthase, the target of activated AMPK, were both increased which could be blocked by EP4 blocking peptide and simulated by the agonist of EP4 but not EP1, EP2 or EP3. The pro-angiogenic role of PGE2 could be repressed by EP4 blocking peptide and retarded in EP4(+/-) mice. Therefore, by promoting the differentiation and migration of BMCs, PGE2 reinforced their neovascularization by binding to the receptor of EP4 in an AMPK-dependent manner. PGE2 may have clinical value in ischemic heart disease."

Commun. 2006; 340: 1028-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), known to be involved in protein-protein interactions. MxiM, PilF, and PilW differ substantially from PulS (<15% sequence identity). Furthermore, although many accessory proteins like PulS, OutS (the PulS homolog from Erwinia chrysanthemi), and MxiM bind the C-terminal region of secretins (10Okon M. Moraes T.F. Lario P.I.

Microbiology. 1998; 144: 3219-3228Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), other chaperones, for example YscW from Yersinia enterocolitica, bind elsewhere (19Burghout P. Beckers F. de Wit E. van Boxtel R. Cornelis G.R. Tommassen J. Koster M. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 5366-5375Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Comparisons of secretin chaperone sequences and functions allow their classification into different families; the PulS family, called pilotins, is found in only a limited number of type II secretion systems that share high sequence similarity and appears to have a different mode of function from other secretin chaperones such as MxiM and PilF/W, leading us to predict that its structure would also be different. PulS is a triacylated lipoprotein that localizes to the OM of Escherichia coli and interacts specifically with the S domain (Sdom) of PulD to protect PulD monomers from degradation and to target them to the OM via the conserved OM lipoprotein-sorting pathway (7Collin S. Guilvout I. Nickerson N.N. Pugsley A.P. Mol. Microbiol. 2011; 80: 655-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 9Hardie K.R. Seydel A. Guilvout I. Pugsley A.P. Mol.

In vitro studies demonstrated that PulD does not require PulS for multimerization or membrane insertion (22Guilvout I. Chami M. Berrier C. Ghazi A. Engel A. Pugsley A.P. Bayan N. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 382: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In the absence of PulS, or when Sdom is deleted, PulD mislocalizes to the inner membrane, where it induces the phage shock response (7Collin S. Guilvout I. Nickerson N.N. Pugsley A.P. Mol. Microbiol. 2011; 80: 655-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 9Hardie K.R. Seydel A. Guilvout I. Pugsley A.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 967-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The fusion of PulD Sdom to the C terminus of the f1 bacteriophage phage secretin pIV increased the efficiency of its targeting to the OM in the presence of PulS, but the absence of PulS rendered the chimera susceptible to proteolysis (20Daefler S. Guilvout I. Hardie K.R. Pugsley A.P. Russel M. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Likewise, fusion of Sdom to the C terminus of periplasmic maltose-binding protein (MalE) rendered it more susceptible to proteolysis (9Hardie K.R. Seydel A. Guilvout I. Pugsley A.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 967-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a soluble periplasmic version of PulS (MalE-PulS) stabilized PulD but did not target it to the OM, thereby uncoupling protection and targeting functions of PulS (9Hardie K.R. Seydel A. Guilvout I. Pugsley A.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 967-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). PulD completely lacking Sdom was degraded even in the presence of PulS, but removal of only the last 25 residues of Sdom abolished targeting but not protection by PulS (20Daefler S. Guilvout I. Hardie K.R. Pugsley A.P. Russel M. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 21Guilvout I. Hardie K.R. Sauvonnet N. Pugsley A.P. J.

To understand better how PulS protects and targets PulD to the OM, we studied the interaction between PulS and a soluble polypeptide corresponding to Sdom in vitro. We determined their stoichiometry and affinity, as well as their secondary structures before and after association, and we identified a minimal PulS binding region in Sdom. We discuss the data in relation to the structures of other secretin chaperones and their interactions with their cognate secretins. Unless otherwise indicated, chemicals were of molecular biology grade and were purchased from Sigma. Thermolysin (Sigma), thrombin (Novagen), and Factor Xa (New England Biolabs) were used according to the manufacturers' recommendations. DNA polymerases, restriction endonucleases, and DNA modification enzymes were from New England Biolabs, Invitrogen, or Roche Applied Science. Vectors pMal-c2 and pMal-p2X were purchased from New England Biolabs, and pQE30 was obtained from Qiagen. Plasmid purification, PCR purification, and gel extraction kits were purchased from Qiagen and used according to the manufacturers' recommendations. DNA encoding PulS without its signal peptide was cloned into the pMal-p2X vector, previously modified to include an additional His6 tag at the MalE N terminus (17Trindade M.B. Job V. Contreras-Martel C. Pelicic V. Dessen A. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 378: 1031-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). pulS was amplified using forward primer PNN19 (see supplemental Table 1 for primer sequences) with a SnaBI restriction site to replace Cys18+ with Val18+ after Factor Xa cleavage, and reverse primer PNN12 with a HindIII site, and cloned into XmnI-HindIII digested pMal-p2X. DNA encoding the C-terminal 71 amino acids of PulD (Sdom) was amplified with primers PNN28 and PNN29 and cloned into the BamHI-HindIII sites of pQE30. Alternatively, DNA encoding Sdom, SdomA, and SdomB were constructed as MalE fusions with primers PNN55 and PNN56, PNN55 and PNN58, and PNN57 and PNN56, respectively, in pMal-c2 digested with EcoRI and HindIII. Primers were designed to encode an N-terminal thrombin cleavage site to allow removal of MalE. The region corresponding to SdomA (Glu599–Leu628) in full-length pulD, from vector pCHAP3635 (21Guilvout I. Hardie K.R. Sauvonnet N. Pugsley A.P. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 7212-7220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was either deleted using primer pair PNN67 and PNN68 or replaced with the linker region (ENSSSNNNNNNNNNNLGIEGRISEFGSSRV) of the pMal-c2 vector using primer pair PNN69 and PNN70 by two-step inverse PCR, and the resulting plasmids were used for in vivo complementation studies. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. E. coli producing MalE-PulS and His6-Sdom were grown in Terrific Broth (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar, 25Tartof K.D. Hobbs C.A. Focus. 1987; 9: 12Google Scholar) to A600 of 0.5 and induced with 0.5 mm isopropylthiogalactoside for 4 h at either 30 or 37 °C. Cells were harvested, resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and 20 μg/ml of DNase and RNase), lysed either by sonication or with a French press and centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 20 min to remove the debris. Recombinant proteins were purified from the supernatant fraction by affinity chromatography using a 5-ml HiTrap chelating column (GE Healthcare) charged with nickel and equilibrated in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, with 500 mm NaCl and 10 mm imidazole. Proteins were eluted with a linear 10–500 mm imidazole gradient. MalE-PulS was dialyzed against 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 20 mm NaCl before overnight digestion with either Factor Xa (1:50) or thermolysin (1:1000), and PulS was purified by cation exchange using a HiTrap 1-ml SP-Sepharose column (GE Healthcare). The sample was further purified, and the buffer was exchanged to 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl by size exclusion chromatography using a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare). Factor Xa cleaved specifically between the MalE fusion and the PulS protein to yield full-length PulS with Cys18+ changed to Val18+. Alternatively, limited proteolysis trials revealed that PulS could also be cleaved from the MalE fusion by thermolysin treatment, cleaving specifically at Val30+ of PulS. All data obtained with thermolysin-treated PulS was indistinguishable from those obtained with full-length PulS; therefore, only the former are shown. After affinity purification, His6-Sdom was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, and further purified on a 1-ml Resource Q column (GE Healthcare). MalE fused to Sdom, SdomA, or SdomB (see text for description of these polypeptide fragments) was purified from the soluble fraction of cell lysates in 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA on amylose-agarose resin (New England BioLabs) and eluted with 20 mm maltose. Pooled fractions of the chimeras with or without digestion by thrombin (1:1000 molar ratio of protease to fusion protein) to remove MalE were dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, and purified on a HiTrap Capto Q 1-ml column (GE Healthcare) with a linear NaCl gradient. All batch purifications were performed on an ÄKTA Purifier FPLC system (GE Healthcare), and analytical studies were performed on an Ettan LC HPLC system. Analytical size exclusion chromatography of proteins and complexes was performed with a prepacked Superdex 75 PC 3.2/30 column with a bed volume of 2.4 ml (GE Healthcare). A280 was measured to estimate the protein content in the samples, and the concentration was calculated from extinction coefficients obtained from the ExPASy ProtParam tool. All purified proteins and processing events were confirmed by Edman N-terminal sequencing and mass spectrometry, and the absence of aggregates was confirmed by dynamic light scattering measurements (DynaPro Plate reader, Wyatt Technology). E. coli strain PAP105 (Δ(lac-pro) F′ (lacIq1 ΔlacZM15 proAB+ Tn10)) was used for plasmid manipulations and complementation studies. Strains were grown under aeration conditions at 30 °C in LB broth or LB with 10% M63 minimal media, with 0.4% maltose for induction of the secretion machinery and antibiotics where appropriate (chloramphenicol, 25 μg·ml−1; ampicillin, 100 μg·ml−1). For secretion assays, pCHAP8243 (a derivative of pCHAP231 carrying the full pul operon with a pulD deletion and encoding soluble nonacylated variant of PulA (26Franceti O. Pugsley A.P. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 7045-7055Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar)) complemented with pulD (pCHAP3635) and pulD variants was grown to an A600 of ∼1.5 and centrifuged to separate cells and supernatant. To observe PulS protection and targeting of PulD, PAP105 carrying wild type PulD or the PulD variants was grown with or without the presence of PulS (pCHAP585 (20Daefler S. Guilvout I. Hardie K.R. Pugsley A.P. Russel M. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar)). Samples were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, probed with protein-specific antibodies, and detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare). 50 μm PulS, 50 μm Sdom, or an equimolar mixture of the two were digested with 30, 15, or 7.5 nm thermolysin for 4 h at room temperature, and the reaction was stopped by adding 2 mm 1,10-phenanthroline. Samples were heated to 100 °C in SDS-PAGE loading buffer with 5 mm DTT and separated by electrophoresis in 12% polyacrylamide gels (SDS-PAGE) using Tris-glycine-HCl buffers. Protein markers PageRuler Plus and Spectra Multicolor low range protein ladders were from Fermentas. CD spectra were recorded on an Aviv 215 spectropolarimeter (Aviv Biomedical) with protein samples at 0.4–0.8 mg·ml−1 in 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaF. Far-UV CD spectra were recorded between 190 and 260 nm using a cylindrical cell with a 0.01-cm path length and an averaging time of 1 s per step. Three consecutive scans from each sample were merged to produce an averaged spectrum and corrected using buffer base lines measured under the same conditions. Data were normalized to the molar peptide bond concentration and path length and expressed as mean residue ellipticity ([θ] degree·cm2·dmol−1). The relative secondary structure content was estimated from the far-UV CD spectra using the CDSSTR routine (27Johnson W.C. Proteins. 1999; 35: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar) of the DICHROWEB server (28Whitmore L. Wallace B.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W668-W673Crossref PubMed Scopus (1953) Google Scholar, 29Whitmore L. Wallace B.A. Biopolymers. 2008; 89: 392-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (1742) Google Scholar) run on the SP175 reference dataset (30Lees J.G. Miles A.J. Wien F. Wallace B.A. Bioinformatics. 2006; 22: 1955-1962Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) containing 72 proteins representing a large panel of secondary structures. Similar results were obtained from different datasets (31Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (2445) Google Scholar) and using the CONTIN/LL routine (32Provencher S.W. Glöckner J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1857) Google Scholar). Thermal denaturation of the proteins was measured by monitoring the change in ellipticity at 206 or 222 nm over the range of 20–100 °C, in increments of 1 °C and an averaging time of 4 s per step. The experimental denaturation profiles were analyzed by a nonlinear least squares fit assuming a two-state transition and used to calculate the melting temperature (Tm) and enthalpy of unfolding (ΔH) (33Santoro M.M. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8063-8068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1589) Google Scholar, 34Swint L. Robertson A.D. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 2037-2049Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Dual cell cuvettes containing two adjacent chambers of 0.44 cm each were used for mixing experiments to determine the gain in secondary structure of the complex. CD spectra from 203 to 260 nm were recorded for 50 μm PulS or 50 μm Sdom, with the second compartment filled with buffer as a control. Subsequently, PulS and Sdom were placed in either one of the two chambers, and their combined spectra were acquired before mixing and after mixing. The change in spectra was attributed to a gain or loss of secondary structure upon complex formation. Raw data are presented as ellipticity in millidegrees. Fluorescence studies were performed on a PTI Quanta-Master QM4CW spectrofluorometer (Photon Technology International) at 25 °C using a 10-mm wide quartz cell. The excitation wavelength was 295 nm, and intrinsic fluorescence emission of the single tryptophan residue of PulS was recorded from 310 to 400 nm. Bandwidths of excitation and emission monochromators were set at 1 and 10 nm, respectively. Cells were charged with 1 μm of PulS in a final volume of 1 ml, and Sdom was added in 0.1 μm increments. The 1H NMR spectrum of 0.3 mm Sdom (30 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 10% D2O, total volume of 240 μl) was acquired on an INOVA spectrometer (Varian) operating at 600-MHz 1H frequency and equipped with a cryogenic probe, with 64 scans and 1024 points at 25 °C. The water signal was suppressed by excitation sculpting with gradients. Equilibrium and velocity experiments were performed at 20 °C in 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl on a Proteomelab XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter) equipped with an AN60-Ti rotor. The protein concentration as a function of radial position and time was measured by absorbance at 280 nm. The buffer viscosity η = 1.021 centipoise and density ρ = 1.00499 g·ml−1 were calculated with Sednterp 1.09, as well as the partial specific volume of PulS, v̄ = 0.723 ml·g−1. The partial specific volume of Sdom, v̄ = 0.667 ml·g−1 was measured by sedimentation equilibrium experiments using the computed molecular mass. The partial specific volume of the PulS-Sdom mixture was calculated by weight average of PulS and Sdom partial specific volume values, v̄ = 0.699 ml·g−1. For sedimentation equilibrium experiments, Sdom samples (120 μl at 25 μm, 50 μm, 100 μm) were loaded in a 1.2-mm thick double sector aluminum centerpiece and centrifuged successively for 27 h at rotor speeds of 26,000 rpm, 23 h at 32,000 rpm, and 16 h at 45,000 rpm. Data were recorded for each speed after controlling that the sedimentation/diffusion equilibrium had been reached. The base line was measured at 60,000 rpm after 6 h. Radial distributions were analyzed by global fitting of the three speeds using the one species model of the UltraScan 9.9 software (35Demeler B. Scott D.J. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Modern Analytical Ultracentrifugation: Techniques and Methods. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK2005: 210-229Google Scholar). For sedimentation velocity experiments, the protein samples (400 μl each) of 100 μm PulS, 100 μm Sdom, and of the mixture of PulS-Sdom at a ratio of 50:100, 75:75, and 100:50 μm, were loaded in 1.2-mm thick double sector aluminum centerpiece and spun at 60,000 rpm. Sedimentation velocity profiles were monitored at 4-min intervals. Data were analyzed with the Sedfit 12.0 software using a continuous size distribution c(s) model (36Brown P.H. Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2006; 90: 4651-4661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). 200-μl samples of 200 μm Sdom or 130 μm 1:1 molar ratio PulS-Sdom complex were separated according to their hydrodynamic size on a Superdex-75 column (GE Healthcare), in 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl at 20 °C, connected on line to a model 302 triple detector array (Viscotek, Malvern Instruments Ltd.). The triple detector array contains four in-line detectors as follows: (i) a static light-scattering cell with two photodiode detectors at 7° for low angle light scattering and at 90° for right angle laser light scattering; (ii) a deflection refractometer; (iii) a photometer, and (iv) a 4-capillary differential viscometer that measures pressure imbalances of the eluted sample by differential pressure transducers. Protein concentration was determined using both the photometer and the deflection refractometer, and right angle laser light scattering and low angle light scattering data coupled to the concentration provided molecular mass determination and differential viscometer measurements combined with concentration gave the intrinsic viscosity [η]. General procedures and conditions have been described previously (37Chenal A. Guijarro J.I. Raynal B. Delepierre M. Ladant D. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 1781-1789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). BSA was used for molecular mass calibration, and polyethylene oxide standards (Malvern Instruments Ltd.) were used for intrinsic viscosity calibration. All data were acquired and processed using the Omnisec software. The viscosity increment (ν) and the hydration (δ) were calculated as described previously (37Chenal A. Guijarro J.I. Raynal B. Delepierre M. Ladant D. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 1781-1789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 38Karst J.C. Sotomayor Pérez A.C. Guijarro J.I. Raynal B. Chenal A. Ladant D. Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 318-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Briefly, the viscosity increment ν (also called the Simha-Einstein hydrodynamic function) was calculated from the Einstein viscosity relation using the following equation (39Harding S.E. Biophys. Chem. 1995; 55: 69-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar): M[η] = νVHNA, where VH is the hydrodynamic volume defined by VH = 4πRH/3, and NA is Avogadro's number. Assays were performed on the Biacore 2000 instrument (GE Healthcare) equilibrated at 25 °C in 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl supplemented with 0.005% Tween 20. The monoclonal α-MalE mAb565 antibody (40England P. Brégégère F. Bedouelle H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 164-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) was immobilized on three flow cells of a CM5 sensor chip (GE Healthcare) to a level of 12,000–15,000 resonance units (resonance units ∼pg/mm2). For separate experiments, 1,200–2,000 resonance units of ligand (MalE-PulS, MalE-Sdom, or MalE-SdomB) were captured on the surface, while maintaining one free flow cell as an α-MalE blank. Preliminary studies determined that it was not possible to measure directly the true binding affinity using MalE-PulS captured on the surface and Sdom flowed over the surface as the analyte due to mass transport limitations. As an alternative, competition experiments designed to measure binding constants in solution provided a reliable estimation of the true binding affinity (41Nieba L. Krebber A. Plückthun A. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 234: 155-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). For competition experiments, 10 or 30 nm PulS alone or pre-equilibrated with competitor (Sdom, SdomA, or SdomB; 0.2 nm to 1 μm) was injected over the surface loaded with either MalE-Sdom or MalE-SdomB for 4 min at 50 μl/min to allow steady-state equilibrium to be reached. The appropriate conditions and protein concentrations were used to allow accurate determination of Sdom and SdomB affinities. All profiles were double referenced by subtracting the signals from the reference surface and the blank injections of running buffer using the Scrubber 2.0 software (BioLogic Software). Data analysis and affinity calculations were carried out using the BIAEvaluation software (GE Healthcare). Genetic and in vivo studies on PulD demonstrated that the PulS-binding site is within the C-terminal 71 amino acids (20Daefler S. Guilvout I. Hardie K.R. Pugsley A.P. Russel M. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 23Guilvout I. Nickerson N.N. Chami M. Pugsley A.P. Res. Microbiol. 2011; 162: 180-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To understand better the interaction between PulD and PulS, we constructed soluble variants of both proteins. PulS has a conserved intramolecular disulfide bond that is required for function (42Pugsley A.P. Bayan N. Sauvonnet N. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1312-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To preserve the disulfide bond, PulS was exported to the E. coli periplasm as a C-terminal MalE chimera, from which MalE was subsequently removed by thermolysin digestion. PulD spontaneously form"
https://openalex.org/W2127641390,"IL-13 is a Th2 cytokine that promotes alternative activation (M2 polarization) in primary human monocytes. Our studies have characterized the functional IL-13 receptor complex and the downstream signaling events in response to IL-13 stimulation in alternatively activated monocytes/macrophages. In this report, we present evidence that IL-13 induces the activation of a Src family tyrosine kinase, which is required for IL-13 induction of M2 gene expression, including 15-lipoxygenase (15-LO). Our data show that Src kinase activity regulates IL-13-induced p38 MAPK tyrosine phosphorylation via the upstream kinases MKK3 or MKK6. Our findings also reveal that the IL-13 receptor-associated tyrosine kinase Jak2 is required for the activation of both Src kinase as well as p38 MAPK. Further, we found that Src tyrosine kinase-mediated activation of p38 MAPK is required for Stat1 and Stat3 serine 727 phosphorylation in alternatively activated monocytes/macrophages. Additional studies identify Hck as the specific Src family member, stimulated by IL-13 and involved in regulating both p38 MAPK activation and p38 MAPK-mediated 15-LO expression. Finally we show that the Hck regulates the expression of other alternative state (M2)-specific genes (Mannose receptor, MAO-A, and CD36) and therefore conclude that Hck acts as a key regulator controlling gene expression in alternatively activated monocytes/macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W2036057552,"Type III secretion systems (T3SSs) of bacterial pathogens involve the assembly of a surface-localized needle complex, through which translocon proteins are secreted to form a pore in the eukaryotic cell membrane. This enables the transfer of effector proteins from the bacterial cytoplasm to the host cell. A structure known as the C-ring is thought to have a crucial role in secretion by acting as a cytoplasmic sorting platform at the base of the T3SS. Here, we studied SsaQ, an FliN-like putative C-ring protein of the Salmonella pathogenicity island 2 (SPI-2)-encoded T3SS. ssaQ produces two proteins by tandem translation: a long form (SsaQ(L)) composed of 322 amino acids and a shorter protein (SsaQ(S)) comprising the C-terminal 106 residues of SsaQ(L). SsaQ(L) is essential for SPI-2 T3SS function. Loss of SsaQ(S) impairs the function of the T3SS both ex vivo and in vivo. SsaQ(S) binds to its corresponding region within SsaQ(L) and stabilizes the larger protein. Therefore, SsaQ(L) function is optimized by a novel chaperone-like protein, produced by tandem translation from its own mRNA species."
https://openalex.org/W2063764068,"The integrin αvβ8 is a cell surface receptor for the latent domain (LAP) of the multifunctional cytokine TGF-β. Through its association with LAP, TGF-β is maintained in a latent form that must be activated to function. Binding to the integrin αvβ8 with subsequent metalloproteolytic cleavage of LAP represents a major mechanism of TGF-β activation in vivo. Altered expression of the integrin β8 subunit (ITGB8) is found in human chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cancers, and brain vascular malformations. We have previously shown that the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β) increases ITGB8 expression on lung fibroblasts, which increases αvβ8-mediated TGF-β activation in fibrosis and pathologic inflammation. Here we report the mechanism of increased ITGB8 expression by IL-1β. Our data support a model where the chromatin architecture of the ITGB8 core promoter is altered by nucleosomal repositioning that enhances the interaction of an AP1 complex (containing c-Jun and ATF2). This repositioning is caused by the dissociation of HDAC2 with the ITGB8 core promoter, leading to increased histone H4 acetylation and a loosening of nucleosomal-DNA interactions allowing “opening” of the chromatin structure and increased association of c-Jun and ATF-2. These changes are mediated through NFκB- and p38-dependent pathways. Ultimately, these events culminate in increasing ITGB8 transcription, αvβ8 surface expression, and αvβ8-mediated TGFβ activation. The integrin αvβ8 is a cell surface receptor for the latent domain (LAP) of the multifunctional cytokine TGF-β. Through its association with LAP, TGF-β is maintained in a latent form that must be activated to function. Binding to the integrin αvβ8 with subsequent metalloproteolytic cleavage of LAP represents a major mechanism of TGF-β activation in vivo. Altered expression of the integrin β8 subunit (ITGB8) is found in human chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cancers, and brain vascular malformations. We have previously shown that the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β) increases ITGB8 expression on lung fibroblasts, which increases αvβ8-mediated TGF-β activation in fibrosis and pathologic inflammation. Here we report the mechanism of increased ITGB8 expression by IL-1β. Our data support a model where the chromatin architecture of the ITGB8 core promoter is altered by nucleosomal repositioning that enhances the interaction of an AP1 complex (containing c-Jun and ATF2). This repositioning is caused by the dissociation of HDAC2 with the ITGB8 core promoter, leading to increased histone H4 acetylation and a loosening of nucleosomal-DNA interactions allowing “opening” of the chromatin structure and increased association of c-Jun and ATF-2. These changes are mediated through NFκB- and p38-dependent pathways. Ultimately, these events culminate in increasing ITGB8 transcription, αvβ8 surface expression, and αvβ8-mediated TGFβ activation. Integrins are a diverse family of cell surface molecules that mediate critical biologic roles during development and in adult tissues (1Hynes R.O. Matrix Biol. 2004; 23: 333-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Although most integrins mainly function as cell-extracellular matrix adhesion receptors, some interact with cytokines or growth factors. Integrins sharing the αv-integrin subunit (αvβ1, αvβ3, αvβ5, αvβ6, and αvβ8) all bind to the critical multifunctional cytokine TGF-β (2Nishimura S.L. Am. J. Pathol. 2009; 175: 1362-1370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Of these, the integrin αvβ8 is of particular interest as mice with genetic deletion of the β8 subunit (ITGB8) phenocopy many of the developmental abnormalities seen in TGF-β1 null animals (3Aluwihare P.

Three TGF-β isoforms exist in mammals, and the integrin αvβ8 binds to the integrin-recognition motif (RGD) of the LAP of TGF-β1 and -β3 (LAP-TGF-β2 does not have an RGD site) (4Annes J.P. Munger J.S. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar).

Recent work from our laboratory has demonstrated that a major mechanism for the proinflammatory and profibrogenic effects of IL-1β is through the increased expression of ITGB8 by mesenchymal cells (i.e. fibroblasts) (5Kitamura H. Cambier S. Somanath S. Barker T. Minagawa S. Markovics J. Goodsell A. Publicover J. Reichardt L. Jablons D. Wolters P. Hill A. Marks J.D. Lou J. Pittet J.F. Gauldie J. Baron J.L. Nishimura S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 2011; 121: 2863-2875Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Thus, IL-1β drives increased αvβ8-mediated TGF-β activation, which mediates increased collagen synthesis and increased fibroblast chemokine secretion, resulting in enhanced dendritic cell trafficking, subsequent T-cell priming, and pathologic inflammation (5Kitamura H. Cambier S. Somanath S. Barker T. Minagawa S. Markovics J. Goodsell A. Publicover J. Reichardt L. Jablons D. Wolters P. Hill A. Marks J.D. Lou J. Pittet J.F. Gauldie J. Baron J.L. Nishimura S.L. J.

The ITGB8 core promoter and the transcriptional machinery driving basal expression has been recently described. Specifically, we found evidence that Sp1, Sp3, and several AP-1 transcription factors form a complex utilizing an SP binding site and a cyclic-AMP response element (CRE) in the ITGB8 core promoter (24Markovics J.A. Araya J. Cambier S. Jablons D. Hill A. Wolters P.J. Nishimura S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 24695-24706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we demonstrated a requirement for p38-, SP3-, and ATF-2-dependent ITGB8 transcription and subsequent αvβ8 protein expression (24Markovics J.A. Araya J. Cambier S. Jablons D. Hill A. Wolters P.J. Nishimura S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 24695-24706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms regulating IL-1β-mediated transcriptional regulation have not yet been defined. The access of DNA binding transcription factors (TFs) is influenced by the chromatin architecture, which is dictated by the wrapping of DNA around histone octamers forming nucleosomes, with intervening nucleosome-free regions linking adjacent nucleosomes (25Cairns B.R. Nature. 2009; 461: 193-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The accessibility of DNA binding sites for TFs is greatest in the nucleosome-free regions (25Cairns B.R. Nature. 2009; 461: 193-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Thus, there is dynamic competition between nucleosomes and TFs for cis-regulatory sites in gene promoters. Nucleosomes are modified (i.e. acetylated) such that they are repositioned, reconfigured, or ejected through the balance of activities of enzymes, for example histone deacetylases (HDACs) or histone acetyl transferases (HATs) (25Cairns B.R. Nature. 2009; 461: 193-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Together, such modifications help create promoter architectures whereby the density, composition, and positioning of nucleosomes relative to important cis-regulatory sites are dynamically regulated (25Cairns B.R. Nature. 2009; 461: 193-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Here we have defined the mechanism of IL-1β-mediated transcriptional regulation of ITGB8. We have found that IL-1β, through p38- and NFκB-dependent pathways, increases the association of the AP-1 complex members (c-Jun and ATF-2) with the ITGB8 core promoter region. The mechanism of the IL-1β-dependent increased association of c-Jun and ATF-2 is due to increased accessibility of the ITGB8 core promoter region mediated by the decreased association of HDAC2, resulting in increased histone acetylation and opening of the chromatin architecture.

We compared the relative ability of IL-1β with IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 to induce surface expression of αvβ8 on primary human lung fibroblasts. IL-1β had the greatest statistically significant effect in increasing αvβ8 expression by cell surface staining, whereas IL-13 had a lesser but still significant effect; IL-4 and IL-5 both increased αvβ8 expression, but there was more variability in these effects, and they did not reach statistical significance (Fig. 1A). The IL-1β- or IL-13-mediated increase of surface expression of αvβ8 on human lung fibroblasts was confirmed by immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1, B and C). By both cell surface staining and immunoprecipitation, IL-1β consistently increased β8 expression to a greater extent than IL-13 (Fig. 1, A–C). Therefore, we focused on the mechanism of IL-1β-mediated induction of ITGB8 expression. IL-1β treatment of adult lung fibroblasts was associated with an increase in ITGB8 transcript levels that peaked at 24 h and surface protein at 48 h (Fig. 1D). Both the transcript and surface protein levels decreased to basal levels 24 h after their respective peaks. We next compared the effect of IL-1β in mediating increased ITGB8 expression in lung fibroblasts with other mesenchymal-derived cell types, human astrocytes, and dermal fibroblasts (Fig. 1E). IL-1β induced αvβ8 expression in astrocytes but not dermal fibroblasts. Dermal fibroblasts did not express integrin β8 basally or in response to IL-1β, illustrating that there is heterogeneity with respect to ITGB8 expression by mesenchymal cells (Fig. 1E). The transcriptional response of human astrocytes to IL-1β resulted in increased αvβ8 surface expression and TGF-β activation (Fig. 1, F and G), similar to previous studies using human lung fibroblasts, providing further evidence that increases in ITGB8 transcript levels lead to increased αvβ8 surface levels and enhance αvβ8-mediated TGF-β activation (5Kitamura H.

To define the IL-1β-dependent signaling pathways involved in up-regulating ITGB8 expression in lung fibroblasts, chemical inhibitors to the NFκB and MAPK pathways were used in conjunction with IL-1β treatment (Fig. 2, A and B). The p38 MAPK pathway inhibitor, SB202190, reduced the ability of IL-1β to up-regulate integrin β8 surface protein and transcript levels (Fig. 2, A and B).

https://openalex.org/W1979744985,"Lentiviral vectors (LVs) are considered one of the most promising vehicles to efficiently deliver genetic information for basic research and gene therapy approaches. Combining LVs with drug-inducible expression systems should allow tight control of transgene expression with minimal side effect on relevant target cells. A new doxycycline-regulated system based on the original TetR repressor was developed in 1998 as an alternative to the TetR-VP16 chimeras (tTA and rtTA) to avoid secondary effects due to the expression of transactivator domains. However, previously described TetR-based systems required cell cloning and/or antibiotic selection of tetracycline-responsive cells in order to achieve good regulation. In the present manuscript we have constructed a dual Tet-ON system based on two lentiviral vectors, one expressing the TetR through the spleen focus forming virus (SFFV) promoter (STetR) and a second expressing eGFP through the regulatable CMV-TetO promoter (CTetOE). Using these vectors we have demonstrated that the TetR repressor, contrary to the reverse transactivator (rtTA), can be expressed in excess to bind and modulate a high number of TetO operons. We have also showed that this dual vector system can generate regulatable bulk cell lines (expressing high levels of TetR) that are able to modulate transgene expression either by varying doxycycline concentration and/or by varying the amount of CTetOE vector genomes per cell. Based on these results we have developed a new all-in-one lentiviral vector (CEST) driving the expression of TetR through the SFFV promoter and the expression of eGFP through the doxycycline-responsive CMV-TetO operon. This vector efficiently produced Tet-ON regulatable immortalized (293T) and primary (human mesenchymal stem cells and human primary fibroblasts) cells. Bulk doxycycline-responsive cell lines express high levels of the transgene with low amount of doxycycline and are phenotypically indistinct from its parental cells."

The cladoniamides have an unusual, indenotryptoline structure rarely observed among bis-indole alkaloids. I report here the isolation, sequencing, and annotation of the cladoniamide biosynthetic gene cluster and compare it to the recently published gene cluster for BE-54017, a closely related indenotryptoline natural product. The cladoniamide gene cluster differs from the BE-54017 gene cluster in gene organization and in the absence of one N-methyltransferase gene but otherwise contains close homologs to all genes in the BE-54017 cluster. Both gene clusters encode enzymes needed for the construction of an indolocarbazole core, as well as flavin-dependent enzymes putatively involved in generating the indenotryptoline scaffold from an indolocarbazole. These two bis-indolic gene clusters exemplify the diversity of biosynthetic routes that begin from the oxidative dimerization of two molecules of L-tryptophan, highlight enzymes for further study, and provide new opportunities for combinatorial engineering."
https://openalex.org/W2015557079,"Powdery mildews (Erysiphales) are economically important plant pathogens that attack many agricultural crops. Conventional management strategies involving fungicide application face challenges, including the evolution of resistance and concerns over impacts on non-target organisms, that call for investigation of more sustainable alternatives. Mycophagous ladybird beetles (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) feed on powdery mildew and have considerable potential as biological control agents; however, the foraging ecology and behavior of these beetles is not well understood. Here we document the olfactory cues presented by squash plants (Cucurbita moschata) infected by powdery mildew (Podosphaera sp.) and the behavioral responses of twenty-spotted ladybird beetles (Psyllobora vigintimaculata) to these cues. Volatile analyses through gas chromatography revealed a number of volatile compounds characteristic of infected plants, including 3-octanol and its analogues 1-octen-3-ol and 3-octanone. These compounds are typical ""moldy"" odorants previously reported in volatiles collected from other fungi. In addition, infected plants exhibited elevated emissions of several compounds also observed in collections from healthy leaves, including linalool and benzyl alcohol, which are reported to have anti-fungal properties. In Y-tube choice assays, P. vigintimaculata beetles displayed a significant preference for the odors of infected plants compared to those of healthy plants. Moreover, beetles exhibited strong attraction to one individual compound, 1-octen-3-ol, which was the most abundant of the characteristic fungal compounds identified. These results enhance our understanding of the olfactory cues that guide foraging by mycophagous insects and may facilitate the development of integrated disease-management strategies informed by an understanding of underlying ecological mechanisms."

It is detectable in the cerebrospinal fluid following a relapse caused by Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and Neuromyelitis Optica (NMO) spectrum disease. Higher levels are found following an NMO-related relapse. It is not known if GFAP is also detectable in the serum following such relapses. In particular, it is not known if lesions limited to the optic nerve release GFAP in sufficient quantities to be detectable within the serum. The aim of this study was to ascertain the extent to which serum GFAP levels can distinguish between an episode of optic neuritis (ON) related to NMO spectrum disease and ON from other causes.Out of 150 patients consecutively presenting to our eye hospital over the period March 2009 until July 2010, we were able to collect a serum sample from 12 patients who had presented with MS-related ON and from 10 patients who had presented with NMO spectrum disease-related ON. We also identified 8 patients with recurrent isolated ON and 8 patients with a corticosteroid-dependent optic neuropathy in the absence of any identified aetiology. GFAP was detectable in the serum of all but three patients (two patients with MS-related ON and one with recurrent optic neuritis). The median serum GFAP level in the patient group with NMO spectrum disease was 4.63 pg/mL whereas in all other cases combined together, this was 2.14 pg/mL. The difference was statistically significant (P = 0.01). A similar statistically significant difference was found when cases with pathology limited to the optic nerve were compared (P = 0.03).Glial pathology in NMO related optic neuritis is reflected in elevated serum GFAP levels independently of whether or not there is extra-optic nerve disease."

Here we have analyzed the maturation of group X sPLA2 in HEK293 cells, which have been extensively used to analyze sPLA2-induced AA release. Using recombinant mouse (PromGX) and human (ProhGX) proenzymes; HEK293 cells transfected with cDNAs coding for full-length ProhGX, PromGX, and propeptide mutants; and various permeable and non-permeable sPLA2 inhibitors and protease inhibitors, we demonstrate that group X sPLA2 is mainly converted intracellularly and releases AA before externalization from the cell. Most strikingly, the exogenous proenzyme does not elicit AA release, whereas the transfected proenzyme does elicit AA release in a way insensitive to non-permeable sPLA2 inhibitors. In transfected cells, a permeable proprotein convertase inhibitor, but not a non-permeable one, prevents group X sPLA2 maturation and partially blocks AA release. Mutations at the dibasic motif of the propeptide indicate that the last basic residue is required and sufficient for efficient maturation and AA release.

All sPLA2s share the common catalytic property of hydrolyzing phospholipids at the sn-2 position to release fatty acids and lysophospholipids. However, each enzyme has very specific enzymatic properties toward the different phospholipids present in cellular membranes and the extracellular milieu, and they may also function intracellularly during secretion or extracellularly on a variety of phospholipid substrates, such as the cellular plasma membrane, lipoproteins, lung surfactant lipids, or microbial agents (4Murakami M.

Several sPLA2s, including group IIA, III, V, and X, are likely to be involved in the release of AA and other fatty acids as well as lysophospholipids that can be further metabolized into various eicosanoids and related bioactive lipid mediators by different pathways (5Funk C.D.

The precise site of action is unknown, but it is likely to be the luminal face of the membranes encountered during secretion in the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, and secretory vesicles targeted toward the plasma membrane. Evidence that hGIIA sPLA2 acts during secretion and prior to externalization includes the observation that exogenously added enzyme is able to cause AA release only when added to cells at a level more than 1,000-fold higher than the amount of enzyme that is produced in transfected HEK293 cells (23Mounier C.M.

Also, highly potent but cell-impermeable hGIIA sPLA2 inhibitors fully block AA release caused by enzyme added exogenously to cells but not when fatty acid release is catalyzed from transfected cells (23Mounier C.M.

Because hGX and mGX sPLA2s are initially produced as proenzymes, these enzymes would also release AA prior to externalization from cells only if their propeptides are removed by a protease in the secretory compartment. On the other hand, if the propeptide cleavage occurs by an extracellular protease, these group X sPLA2s would only act on the external face of the plasma membrane to elicit fatty acid release.

The PCR products were purified with the Nucleospin DNA Extract kit (Macherey-Nagel) and ligated into the pAB3 vector in frame with the ΔGST protein and the factor Xa cleavage site, and the constructs were fully sequenced to verify their integrity.

Interestingly, mass spectrometry analysis after cleavage by Factor Xa revealed the expected cleavage and a miscleavage of the ΔGST- PromGX fusion protein. Indeed, we observed (i) a cleavage at the Factor Xa site IEGR, which releases the full PromGX protein and (ii) a cleavage after the RR dipeptide present in the middle of the propeptide, which releases the miPromGX sPLA2 protein (see Fig. 1). PromGX and miPromGX sPLA2s were fully separated by the successive HPLC steps, and up to 3–5 mg of pure proenzyme sPLA2 forms were obtained per liter of bacterial culture. Met-hGX sPLA2 (hGX mature sequence with an extra Met residue at the N terminus) was produced in E. coli using a pET21a construct coding for Met-hGX mature protein (i.e. no fusion protein is present except for the Met initiator residue right before the hGX mature protein). This construction was similar to that previously described for hGV recombinant protein (3Singer A.G. Ghomashchi F. Le Calvez C. Bollinger J. Bezzine S. Rouault M. Sadilek M. Nguyen E. Lazdunski M.

Reactions contained 1 ml of buffer (100 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.06% BSA) and 1 μm substrate. The initial slope of the reaction progress curve was found to be linearly proportional to the amount of sPLA2 added in the 0–100 ng range (not shown). sPLA2 enzymatic assays were also carried out using [3H]oleic acid-radiolabeled E. coli membranes as described (37Rouault M.

Briefly, the assay was performed at room temperature for various incubation times (5 min to 1 h) in 300 μl of assay buffer (0.1 m Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.1% BSA) containing ∼100,000 dpm of radiolabeled membranes of E. coli. Sample volume and incubation time were adjusted to be proportional to the amount of added sPLA2. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 300 μl of stop buffer (0.1 m EDTA, 0.2% BSA fatty acid free). After centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 5 min, the supernatant containing released radiolabeled oleate was submitted to scintillation counting. MALDI-TOF analyses of sPLA2s were carried out on an Applied Biosystems voyager DE-PRO mass spectrometer in linear mode with sinapinic acid as a matrix and using external or internal calibration (37Rouault M.

The different constructs and the empty parental vector were transfected in HEK293 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A kill curve with Zeocin was generated to determine the lowest concentration of Zeocin needed to select transfected clones. Stable transfectants were first selected by culturing cells for 3 weeks in the presence of Zeocin at 0.8 mg/ml. Individual clones were isolated by limiting dilution using medium containing 0.2 mg/ml Zeocin.

A detailed knowledge of their temporal and spatial expression profiles, especially of closely related FGF family members, are essential to further identification of specific functions in distinct tissues. In the central nervous system dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra and their axonal projections into the striatum progressively degenerate in Parkinson's disease. In contrast, FGF-2 deficient mice display increased numbers of dopaminergic neurons. In this study, we determined the expression profiles of all 22 FGF-ligands and 10 FGF-receptor isoforms, in order to clarify, if FGF-2 deficiency leads to compensatory up-regulation of other FGFs in the nigrostriatal system. Three tissues, ventral mesencephalon (VM), striatum (STR) and as reference tissue spinal cord (SC) of wild-type and FGF-2 deficient mice at four developmental stages E14.5, P0, P28, and adult were comparatively analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR. As no differences between the genotypes were observed, a compensatory up-regulation can be excluded. Moreover, this analysis revealed that the majority of FGF-ligands (18/22) and FGF-receptors (9/10) are expressed during normal development of the nigrostriatal system and identified dynamic changes for some family members. By comparing relative expression level changes to SC reference tissue, general alterations in all 3 tissues, such as increased expression of FGF-1, -2, -22, FgfR-2c, -3c and decreased expression of FGF-13 during postnatal development were identified. Further, specific changes affecting only one tissue, such as increased FGF-16 (STR) or decreased FGF-17 (VM) expression, or two tissues, such as decreased expression of FGF-8 (VM, STR) and FGF-15 (SC, VM) were found. Moreover, 3 developmentally down-regulated FGFs (FGF-8b, FGF-15, FGF-17a) were functionally characterized by plasmid-based over-expression in dissociated E11.5 VM cell cultures, however, such a continuous exposure had no influence on the yield of dopaminergic neurons in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W2107639579,"DNA damage response (DDR) is vital for genomic stability, and its deficiency is linked to tumorigenesis. Extensive studies in interphase (G(1)-S-G(2)) mammalian cells have revealed the mechanisms of DDR in great detail; however, how mitotic cells respond to DNA damage remains less defined. We report here that a full DDR is suppressed in mitotic mammalian cells until telophase/cytokinesis. Although early DDR markers such as the phosphorylations of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and histone H2A.x (H2AX) can be readily detected, the ionizing radiation-induced foci (IRIF) formation of late DDR markers such as breast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein (BRCA1) and p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1) are absent until the telophase/cytokinesis stage. We further showed that the IR-induced ubiquitination cascade around DNA damage sites did not occur in mitotic cells, which explains, at least in part, why BRCA1 and 53BP1 cannot be recruited to the damaged sites. These observations indicate that DDR is suppressed in mitotic cells after the step of γH2AX formation. Not surprisingly, we found that the absence of a full DDR in mitotic cells was associated with the high cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) activities. More 53BP1 IRIF could be detected when the irradiated mitotic cells were treated with a CDK1 inhibitor. Further, the activation of CDK5 in interphase cells impedes the formation of 53BP1 IRIF. Together, these results suggest that the DDR is suppressed by the high CDK1 activity in mitotic mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W1956164996,"Voltage-gated calcium channels, which play key roles in many physiological processes, are composed of a pore-forming α1 subunit associated with up to three auxiliary subunits. In vertebrates, the role of auxiliary subunits has mostly been studied in heterologous systems, mainly because of the severe phenotypes of knock-out animals. The genetic model Caenorhabditis elegans has all main types of voltage-gated calcium channels and strong loss-of-function mutations in all pore-forming and auxiliary subunits; it is therefore a useful model to investigate the roles of auxiliary subunits in their native context. By recording calcium currents from channel and auxiliary subunit mutants, we molecularly dissected the voltage-dependent calcium currents in striated muscle of C. elegans. We show that EGL-19 is the only α1 subunit that carries calcium currents in muscle cells. We then demonstrate that the α2/δ subunit UNC-36 modulates the voltage dependence, the activation kinetics, and the conductance of calcium currents, whereas another α2/δ subunit TAG-180 has no effect. Finally, we characterize mutants of the two β subunits, CCB-1 and CCB-2. CCB-1 is necessary for viability, and voltage-dependent calcium currents are abolished in the absence of CCB-1 whereas CCB-2 does not affect currents. Altogether these results show that EGL-19, UNC-36, and CCB-1 underlie voltage-dependent calcium currents in C. elegans striated muscle."
https://openalex.org/W2057101841,"Chemotaxis is essential for a number of physiological processes including leukocyte recruitment. Chemokines initiate intracellular signaling pathways necessary for chemotaxis through binding seven transmembrane G protein-couple receptors. Little is known about the proteins that interact with the intracellular domains of chemokine receptors to initiate cellular signaling upon ligand binding. CXCR2 is a major chemokine receptor expressed on several cell types, including endothelial cells and neutrophils. We hypothesize that multiple proteins interact with the intracellular domains of CXCR2 upon ligand stimulation and these interactions comprise a ""chemosynapse"", and play important roles in transducing CXCR2 mediated signaling processes.In an effort to define the complex of proteins that assemble upon CXCR2 activation to relay signals from activated chemokine receptors, a proteomics approach was employed to identify proteins that co-associate with CXCR2 with or without ligand stimulation. The components of the CXCR2 ""chemosynapse"" are involved in processes ranging from intracellular trafficking to cytoskeletal modification. IQ motif containing GTPase activating protein 1 (IQGAP1) was among the novel proteins identified to interact directly with CXCR2. Herein, we demonstrate that CXCR2 co-localizes with IQGAP1 at the leading edge of polarized human neutrophils and CXCR2 expressing differentiated HL-60 cells. Moreover, amino acids 1-160 of IQGAP1 directly interact with the carboxyl-terminal domain of CXCR2 and stimulation with CXCL8 enhances IQGAP1 association with Cdc42.Our studies indicate that IQGAP1 is a novel essential component of the CXCR2 ""chemosynapse""."
https://openalex.org/W2082538976,"The guanine nucleotide exchange factor, C3G (RapGEF1), functions in multiple signaling pathways involved in cell adhesion, proliferation, apoptosis and actin reorganization. C3G is regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation on Y504, known to be mediated by c-Abl and Src family kinases. In the present study we explored the possibility of cellular phospho-C3G (pC3G) being a substrate of the intracellular T-cell protein tyrosine phosphatase TC-PTP (PTPN2) using the human neuroblastoma cell line, IMR-32. In vivo and in vitro binding assays demonstrated interaction between C3G and TC-PTP. Interaction is mediated through the Crk-binding region of C3G and C-terminal noncatalytic residues of TC-PTP. C3G interacted better with a substrate trap mutant of TC48 and this complex formation was inhibited by vanadate. Endogenous pC3G colocalized with catalytically inactive mutant TC48 in the Golgi. Expression of TC48 abrogated pervanadate and c-Src induced phosphorylation of C3G without affecting total cellular phospho-tyrosine. Insulin-like growth factor treatment of c-Src expressing cells resulted in dephosphorylation of C3G dependent on the activity of endogenous TC48. TC48 expression inhibited forskolin induced tyrosine phosphorylation of C3G and neurite outgrowth in IMR-32 cells. Our results identify a novel Golgi localized substrate of TC48 and delineate a role for TC48 in dephosphorylation of substrates required during differentiation of human neuroblastoma cells."

Bugg T.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 98-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), which hydrates 2-hydroxypenta-2,4-dienoic acid to 4-hydroxy-2-ketopentanoic acid (EC 4.2.1.80). In the human genome, a second member of the FAH superfamily has been identified, termed FAH domain-containing protein 1 (FAHD1). The structure of this 25-kDa protein was delineated by x-ray crystallography, revealing a homodimeric mixed β-sandwich roll fold bearing a metal ion binding site and showing strong similarities to known structures of other members of the FAH protein family (8Manjasetty B.A. Niesen F.H. Delbrück H. Götz F. Sievert V. Büssow K. Behlke J. Heinemann U. Biol. Chem. 2004; 385: 935-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, the actual enzymatic properties of FAHD1 were not described previously. Given the central importance of FAH for the metabolism of aromatic amino acids (see above), it is of interest to clarify whether FAHD1 has a similar catalytic profile. Within the same study revealing the FAHD1 structure (8Manjasetty B.A. Niesen F.H. Delbrück H. Götz F. Sievert V. Büssow K. Behlke J. Heinemann U. Biol. Chem. 2004; 385: 935-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), a hydroxylase or decarboxylase function (possibly involved in aromatic amino acid catabolism) was tentatively suggested based on the properties of the putative active site, with the physiologically present active-site cation still to be determined. In a comparative study analyzing the common mechanistic features of the FAH superfamily, striking similarities in the active-site signatures of FAHD1, E. coli YcgM, and Thermus thermophilus TTHA0809 were noted, suggesting a common enzymatic activity for these functionally uncharacterized proteins (6Brouns S.J. Barends T.R. Worm P. Akerboom J. Turnbull A.P. Salmon L. van der Oost J. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 379: 357-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Because the FAH superfamily exhibits such diverse enzymatic functions despite the close structural similarities of its members, especially when focusing on the catalytic center, it is difficult to derive a likely function for FAHD1 from sequence information and structural data alone. In this work, we analyzed the potential activity of FAHD1 toward substrates of the β-diketone class, based on the β-diketone hydrolase activity of other members such as the human fumarylacetoacetase FAH and the Ralstonia sp. strain U2 fumarylpyruvase NagK. It is well known that in metazoans, certain biochemical reactions are of particular importance in specialized tissues, e.g. FAH in the liver (9Kvittingen E.A. Jellum E. Stokke O. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1981; 115: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Moreover, many basic biochemical reactions, e.g. of the TCA cycle, are performed by mitochondrial enzymes, whereas other basic metabolic reactions take place in other subcellular compartments, e.g. the cytosol. Although the cytosolic FAH catalyzes the hydrolysis of fumarylacetoacetate, the localization of the related protein FAHD1 is not known. In the present study, we determined both the tissue expression profile and the subcellular localization of FAHD1. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were isolated and maintained according to the methods described in Ref. 10Unterluggauer H. Hampel B. Zwerschke W. Jansen-Dürr P. Exp. Gerontol. 2003; 38: 1149-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar. Cells were propagated in endothelial cell growth medium (EBM CC-3121 supplemented with CC-4133, Lonza). U-2OS cells (ATCC) were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (D5546, Sigma) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Biochrom AG), 4 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen), and 1% penicillin streptomycin (Invitrogen). All cells were grown in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C and were subcultured by trypsinization with 0.05% trypsin-EDTA (Invitrogen). FAHD1 isoform 2 cDNA (GenBankTM NP_112485) was amplified from RNA by RT-PCR using specific primers and introduced into the pET30a vector via the NcoI and BamHI restriction sites, expressing full-length FAHD1 with an N-terminal His6 tag and S-tag. For the pET30a-FAHD1mut plasmid, two mutations (D102A and R106A) were introduced into the FAHD1 sequence by PCR. BL21(DE3) pLysS bacteria were transformed with pET30a-FAHD1 and pET30a-FAHD1mut, respectively, and streaked on LB plates using kanamycin/chloramphenicol selection. 1 liter of NZCYM medium (containing the appropriate antibiotics) was inoculated with 1% LB overnight culture obtained from a single colony and grown at 225 rpm/37 °C to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.5. The culture was then induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and further incubated for 6 h at 16 °C. After centrifugation for 10 min at 3,800 × g/4 °C, the bacterial pellets were stored at −70 °C. Frozen bacterial pellets obtained from 1 liter of NZCYM (see above) were resuspended in 20 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 8.0. After incubation on ice for 20 min, the solution was sonicated 5 × 20 s (Branson Sonifier 250, 50% duty cycle, output 4) and centrifuged for 45 min at 40,000 × g/4 °C (Beckman, JA17). The supernatant was filtered through a 0.22-μm syringe filter (Millipore, Millex) and applied to a 3-ml nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (His-Bind, Novagen) equilibrated with running buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). The column was washed with 30 ml of wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm imidazole, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 8.0), and bound protein was eluted with 5 ml of elution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 250 mm imidazole, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 8.0). The eluate was dialyzed against buffer A (50 mm sodium phosphate, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, pH 5.7) on ice for 2 h and centrifuged for 10 min at 20,000 × g/4 °C. The supernatant was loaded onto a cation exchange column (Mono S, GE Healthcare), washed with 20 ml of buffer A, and eluted by applying a 100-ml salt gradient ranging from buffer A to buffer B (50 mm sodium phosphate, 1 m NaCl, 1 mm DTT, pH 5.7). The main peak fractions containing FAHD1 were twice diluted 1:10 with assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm KCl, pH 7.4) and concentrated to a volume of 1 ml (Amicon Ultra, Millipore). Aliquots were shock-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. FAHD1 activity relative to FAHD1 protein content was monitored via photometric acetylpyruvate hydrolase assay throughout the purification and was not significantly affected by the purification steps. 1.6 mg of purified recombinant FAHD1 were utilized for the generation of affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antisera (BioGenes GmbH). For human samples, whole cell extracts were prepared from the following cells: osteosarcoma cells (U-2OS), epithelial cervical cancer cells (HeLa), foreskin fibroblasts, HUVEC, renal proximal tubule epithelial cells, aortic smooth muscle cells, immortalized prostate smooth muscle cells (PM151T), and preadipocytes. For mouse samples, total fractions were prepared from the following mouse tissues: kidney, pancreas, skin, muscle, liver, prostate, cerebellum, cerebrum, and adipocytes. Samples (20 μg of total protein for human lysates, 10 μg for mouse lysates) were separated by SDS-PAGE (12.5% acrylamide) and blotted onto a PVDF membrane. FAHD1 primary antibody (purpose-made, 2 μg/ml) and anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (Dako P0399, 1:2,500) were applied by standard Western blot protocol. β-Actin antibody (Sigma A5441, 1:20,000) was used for loading control with an anti-mouse HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (Dako P0447, 1:4,000). Detection was achieved by ECL Plus (GE Healthcare). The FAHD1 shRNA sequence 5′-AGAUGAACCCUUCAAGAAA-3′ derived from the 3′-untranslated region of the FAHD1 mRNA (specific to transcript variant 2) was introduced into the pLKO.1 vector (Addgene). The pLKO.1-TRC control vector (Addgene, plasmid 10879) was used as a negative control for knockdown. The FAHD1 isoform 2 coding region was amplified by PCR using specific primers, introduced into the pENTR/D-TOPO entry vector (Invitrogen), and transferred into the pLenti6/V5-DEST destination vector (Invitrogen) via recombination. pLenti6/V5-DEST empty vector was used as a negative control for overexpression. Production of lentiviruses using 293FT cells and titering of the virus stocks were performed as described earlier (11Mück C. Herndler-Brandstetter D. Micutkova L. Grubeck-Loebenstein B. Jansen-Dürr P. J. Gerontol. A Biol. Sci. Med. Sci. 2010; 65: 1165-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). HUVEC (passage 5) were seeded on 6-well plates (40,000 cells/well) and cultivated in EBM CC-3121. On the next day, the medium was aspirated and replaced with 1 ml of EBM CC-3121 containing 8 μg/μl Polybrene and FAHD1 knockdown, overexpression, or control lentiviruses, respectively (multiplicity of infection = 5). On the next day, the medium was aspirated and replaced with 2 ml of EBM CC-3121. Knockdown cells were harvested after 3 days. Overexpression cells were put under blasticidin selection (10 μg/ml) after 3 days and harvested 12 days after infection. HUVEC (passage 10) were subjected to cell fractionation using the Qproteome cell compartment kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Resulting fractions were diluted 1:4 with protein sample buffer (10% SDS, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 50% glycerol, 0.5 m DTT, 300 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8). Cytosolic (15 μl), membrane compartment (22.5 μl), and nuclear (30 μl) fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE (12.5% acrylamide) and blotted onto a PVDF membrane. Antibodies directed against FAHD1 (purpose-made, 2 μg/ml), GAPDH (Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-25778, 1:5,000), OxPhos complex V subunit β (Molecular Probes A21351, 1:2,500), and P84 (Abcam ab487, 1:2,000) were used followed by anti-rabbit/anti-mouse HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Dako P0399/P0447, 1:2,500–1:10,000). Detection was achieved by ECL Plus (GE Healthcare). HUVEC (passage 5) were seeded on 12-mm diameter glass slides and cultivated overnight. All the following steps were performed at room temperature if not otherwise noted. Cells were washed two times with PBS and fixated for 20 min in ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. After washing four times with ice-cold PBS, the cells were permeabilized 3 min on ice with 0.3% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium citrate in PBS. Cells were washed four times with ice-cold PBS and incubated for 20 min in blocking buffer (PBS, 1% BSA). Primary antibody directed against FAHD1 (rabbit polyclonal, purpose-made, 20 μg/ml) was added in blocking buffer and incubated for 1 h. Cells were washed three times with PBS for 5 min. Primary antibodies directed against complex II flavoprotein subunit (Invitrogen catalog number 459200, mouse monoclonal, 10 μg/ml), complex IV mitochondrial subunit I (Invitrogen 459600, mouse monoclonal, 33 μg/ml), and catalase (Abcam ab88650, mouse polyclonal, 33 μg/ml), respectively, were added in blocking buffer and incubated for 1 h. Cells were washed three times with PBS for 5 min. Goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes, A11008) and goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 546 (Molecular Probes, A11003) were added as secondary antibodies and incubated for 1 h at room temperature (4 μg/ml in blocking buffer). Glass slides were washed three times with PBS and mounted in triethylenediamine solution. Samples were analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy at 100× magnification using the confocal scanning system MicroRadiance (Bio-Rad) in combination with an Axiophot (Zeiss) microscope. Previously synthesized acetylpyruvate (12Brecker L. Pogorevc M. Griengl H. Steiner W. Kappe T. Ribbons D.W. New J. Chem. 1999; 23: 437-446Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar) was a kind gift of Prof. Lothar Brecker. For comparison of wild-type and mutant FAHD1 activities, 1-ml samples of 90 μm acetylpyruvate in assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm KCl, pH 7.4) containing 1 mm MgCl2 were supplemented with purified FAHD1 or FAHD1mut (20 μg in 20 μl each) or blank control. Samples were incubated at room temperature and analyzed in regular time intervals by measuring absorbance (infinite M200, Tecan) between 280 and 350 nm (λmax = 297 nm, ϵ = 9986 m−1 cm−1). Reaction mixtures containing no substrate were used as blank. To evaluate the influence of divalent metal ions on FAHD1 activity, the purified protein was first incubated with 5 mm EDTA and then dialyzed against assay buffer supplemented with 1 mm MgCl2, MnCl2, CaCl2, ZnCl2, or EDTA, respectively. 95 μl of a 200 μm solution of acetylpyruvate in assay buffer were mixed with 95 μl (70 μg) of purified recombinant FAHD1 protein and incubated at room temperature for 4 h. A blank lacking FAHD1 was incubated analogously. The conversion mixture and blank of the FAHD1 reaction were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using an ÄKTA purifier system (GE Healthcare) equipped with a Bio-Rad Aminex HPX-87H column (300 × 7.8 mm). Detection was at 210 nm. 84 μl of sample were injected and eluted with 5 mm H2SO4 as the eluent at a flow rate of 0.5 ml min−1 at room temperature. Identification and quantitation of products were based on the characteristic retention times of high purity standards (>99%) of acetate and pyruvate. Pyruvate was also independently confirmed as a product by using a substrate-specific analytic kit for pyruvate quantitation (pyruvate assay kit K609-100, BioVision). Plasmids pET5a-NagI (pWWF19–25) and pET5a-NagL (pWWF53) (13Zhou N.Y. Fuenmayor S.L. Williams P.A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 700-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) were kind gifts from Prof. P. A. Williams, University of Wales, United Kingdom. BL21(DE3) pLysS bacteria were transformed with the respective plasmids and streaked on LB plates (ampicillin/chloramphenicol). NZCYM medium (containing the appropriate antibiotics) was inoculated with LB overnight cultures obtained from single colonies and grown at 225 rpm/37 °C to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.5. Cultures were then induced by the addition of 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and further incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. Cultures were aliquoted and centrifuged for 5 min at 2,700 × g/4 °C. The resulting pellets (∼0.06 g of wet weight) were stored at −20 °C. Bacterial pellets of E. coli BL21(DE3) pLysS pET5a-NagI (gentisate 1,2-dioxygenase) and pET5a-NagL (maleylpyruvate isomerase), respectively, were resuspended in 150 μl of ice-cold assay buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4) and lysed for 20 min on ice. Homogenization was achieved by repeatedly drawing the lysate through a 25-gauge needle attached to a 1-ml syringe. Lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 rpm/4 °C. Total protein content of the supernatants was determined by the Bradford protein assay. 1-ml samples of 60 μm gentisate (Merck) in assay buffer were supplemented with NagI cell extract (45 μg in 24 μl) and incubated at room temperature for 5 min to produce maleylpyruvate from gentisate in situ (13Zhou N.Y. Fuenmayor S.L. Williams P.A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 700-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) followed by the addition of 2 μl of 100 mm reduced glutathione and NagL cell extract (33 μg in 10 μl) and incubation at room temperature for 1 min. Immediately afterward, purified FAHD1 was added (24 μg in 7 μl), and samples were incubated at room temperature and analyzed in regular time intervals by measuring absorbance (infinite M200, Tecan) between 300 and 400 nm (λmax = 330 nm, ϵ = 14160 m−1 cm−1). Reaction mixtures containing no substrate were used as blank. 1-ml samples of 90 μm methyl-3-acetylpyruvate (Aldrich) or acetylacetone (Fluka) in assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4) were supplemented with purified FAHD1 (17 μg in 5 μl). Samples were incubated at room temperature and analyzed in regular time intervals by measuring absorbance (infinite M200, Tecan) between 280 and 350 nm in the case of methylacetopyruvate (λmax = 305 nm, ϵ = 11630 m−1 cm−1) and between 260 and 330 nm in the case of acetylacetone (λmax = 280 nm, ϵ = 2120 m−1 cm−1). Reaction mixtures containing no substrate were used as blank. Although orthologs of human FAHD1 are present in all eukaryotes analyzed so far (data not shown), no information is available concerning their catalytic activity or other functions. A large number of FAH superfamily members can be found in the genomes of prokaryotes, and in some cases, their diverse catalytic activities have been well established. We performed a primary sequence alignment including FAHD1, FAH, and several prokaryotic members of the FAH superfamily with known enzymatic activities (Fig. 1). By concentrating on the catalytically most important residues, we tried to identify the closest homolog of FAHD1 and, thereby, narrow down the list of likely enzymatic functions. We especially focused on eight charged amino acids (Fig. 1, highlighted) that are located in the vicinity of the putative active site of FAHD1 and are thought to create the environment required for substrate binding (8Manjasetty B.A. Niesen F.H. Delbrück H. Götz F. Sievert V. Büssow K. Behlke J. Heinemann U. Biol. Chem. 2004; 385: 935-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). These residues are composed of Asp-102 and Arg-106, whose structural equivalents in FAH were found to lead to hereditary tyrosinemia when mutated, and six charged residues in their immediate environment that form salt bridges with each other (8Manjasetty B.A. Niesen F.H. Delbrück H. Götz F. Sievert V. Büssow K. Behlke J. Heinemann U. Biol. Chem. 2004; 385: 935-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Although both the E. coli decarboxylase HpcE and the Ralstonia sp. strain U2 hydrolase NagK showed reasonable (30–40%) overall homology, these eight amino acids were fully conserved in NagK, whereas they were less well conserved in the other candidates (Fig. 1). The genes NagI, NagK, and NagL are found on a plasmid in Ralstonia sp. strain U2 and mediate the capability to metabolize gentisate, which itself is a breakdown product of aromatic amino acids and other compounds (13Zhou N.Y. Fuenmayor S.L. Williams P.A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 700-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Through the sequential activity of NagI, NagL, and NagK, gentisate is metabolized to maleylpyruvate, which is then isomerized to fumarylpyruvate and broken down to pyruvate and fumarate (Fig. 2). Because bioinformatics analysis had revealed the fumarylpyruvate hydrolase NagK as the closest candidate (Fig. 1), we decided to proceed by testing FAHD1 for potential acylpyruvase activity. To test FAHD1 for potential activities, we prepared bacterial expression vectors for wild-type FAHD1 and for a mutant construct with mutations in Asp-102 and Arg-106 that were expected to diminish enzymatic activity due to similarities to the FAH structure, as mentioned above. To allow efficient purification of recombinant FAHD1 proteins, N-terminal His tags and S-tags were included (Fig. 3A). After expression in E. coli, both wild-type and mutant FAHD1 were purified over a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column followed by ion exchange chromatography, yielding highly pure protein with no remaining visible contaminants (Fig. 3B). To assess the potential acylpyruvate hydrolase activity of FAHD1, the simplest respective substrate analog, acetylpyruvate (Fig. 2), was tested by a photometric assay. Indeed, the addition of purified wild-type FAHD1 induced breakdown of acetylpyruvate, as observed by the time-dependent reduction of the signal, whereas no metabolization was visible in the blank control. The ability of mutant FAHD1 to hydrolyze acetylpyruvate was severely reduced (Fig. 3C), suggesting that Asp-102 and Arg-106 play key roles for the catalytic activity of FAHD1, consistent with predictions derived from structural analysis (8Manjasetty B.A. Niesen F.H. Delbrück H. Götz F. Sievert V. Büssow K. Behlke J. Heinemann U. Biol. Chem. 2004; 385: 935-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To confirm the products of the acetylpyruvate breakdown by FAHD1, the reaction mixture containing the substrate was analyzed by HPLC before and after incubation with purified FAHD1 protein. As expected, this experiment showed the degradation of acetylpyruvate and emergence of pyruvate and acetate (Fig. 4A). Peak quantification yielded stoichiometric levels of pyruvate and acetate, and the appearance of pyruvate was also independently confirmed using a commercial assay kit (data not shown). We also determined enzyme kinetics by measuring the reaction rate in relation to substrate concentration (Fig. 4B), thereby calculating a Km value of 4.6 μm. The maximum acetylpyruvate hydrolase activity of purified FAHD1 in our assay buffer was determined as 0.14 μmol min−1 mg−1 at room temperature, amounting to about 15% of the value reported for acetylpyruvate hydrolase from Pseudomonas putida (14Davey J.F. Ribbons D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 3826-3830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the physiologically present cation within the active site of FAHD1 has not been determined yet (8Manjasetty B.A. Niesen F.H. Delbrück H. Götz F. Sievert V. Büssow K. Behlke J. Heinemann U. Biol. Chem. 2004; 385: 935-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), we decided to test acetylpyruvate hydrolase activity in the presence of different divalent metal ions. Purified FAHD1 was depleted of bivalent metal ions through incubation with EDTA and subsequent dialysis, prior to the addition of metal ions to the apoenzyme. We observed the highest activity in the presence of 1 mm Mg2+ (as used in our standard assay buffer), followed by Mn2+, whereas only weak activity was observed in the presence of Ca2+ and Zn2+ (Fig. 5A). To test for substrate specificity, we included a selection of structurally related substrates of the acylpyruvate/β-diketone class in our FAHD1 assay: acetylpyruvate, fumarylpyruvate, methylacetopyruvate, and acetylacetone. It turned out that among these candidates, acetylpyruvate and fumarylpyruvate were the preferred substrates of FAHD1, and relatively minor structural changes, such as the presence of a methyl ester group, led to a significant reduction in enzymatic activity (Fig. 5B). Acetoacetyl-CoA was also tested with FAHD1, but no activity toward this substrate was observed (data not shown). To address the expression pattern of FAHD1, extracts from several human cell types, including both normal, untransformed cells and tumor cells, were probed in Western blot with antibodies raised against purified human FAHD1. This experiment revealed ubiquitous expression of FAHD1 in all analyzed cell types, at varying levels (Fig. 6A). In addition to the main band corresponding to a molecular mass of 28 kDa, a further band corresponding to a molecular mass of 32 kDa was visible in some of the cell types. Lentiviral shRNA knockdown of FAHD1 in HUVEC led to a significant reduction of the main FAHD1 protein species, whereas the 32-kDa band remained unchanged. This upper band also proved to be unaffected by lentiviral overexpression of FAHD1 in HUVEC (Fig. 6B). We also addressed the expression of FAHD1 in several mouse tissues. We found FAHD1 to be ubiquitously expressed in all mouse tissues analyzed by Western blot, and expression was highest in the kidney and the liver (Fig. 6C). Similar to our findings from human cell types, we observed two bands with apparent molecular mass of 25 and 30 kDa, respectively, the higher molecular mass form being visible in only some of the samples. Applying biochemical fractionation to HUVEC, we found a high proportion of FAHD1 in the fraction composed of membrane compartments, consistent with mitochondrial localization. A small proportion of FAHD1 was found in the cytosol, whereas no signal was detectable in the nuclear fraction (Fig. 7). The subcellular localization of FAHD1 was further analyzed by immunofluorescence, revealing a characteristic staining pattern resembling mitochondrial staining. Co-staining mitochondria with antibodies to complex II and complex IV revealed substantial colocalization, whereas co-staining with catalase antibody, used as a peroxisomal marker, served as a negative control (Fig. 8).FIGURE 8FAHD1 immunofluorescence. Confocal images of immunofluorescence staining of HUVEC for FAHD1 (green, left column), three different localization markers (red, center column), and the resulting merge (right column) are shown. Complex II and complex IV were used as mitochondrial markers, and catalase was used as peroxisomal marker.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the experiments reported here, we found that FAHD1 exhibits acylpyruvase activity, as demonstrated by the hydrolysis of acetylpyruvate and fumarylpyruvate in vitro, whereas several structurally related compounds were hydrolyzed at a significantly reduced rate. Conserved amino acids Asp-102 and Arg-106 of FAHD1 were found important for its catalytic activity, and Mg2+ was required for maximal enzyme activity. FAHD1 was found expressed in all tested murine tissues, with highest expression in liver and kidney. FAHD1 was also found in several human cell lines, where it localized to mitochondria. In summary, the current work identified human FAHD1 as a novel mitochondrial enzyme with acylpyruvate hydrolase activity. Although the bioinformatic analyses carried out initially by Manjasetty et al. (8Manjasetty B.A. Niesen F.H. Delbrück H. Götz F. Sievert V. Büssow K. Behlke J. Heinemann U. Biol. Chem. 2004; 385: 935-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) clearly revealed that FAHD1 contains an FAH domain, this domain is functionally poorly defined as it is involved in several chemically highly unrelated catalytic activities, carried out by β-diketone hydrolases (e.g. EC 3.7.1.2), decarboxylases (e.g. EC 4.1.1.68), isomerases (e.g. EC 5.3.3.10), dehydratases (e.g. EC 4.2.1.43), and hydratases (e.g. EC 4.2.1.80), respectively. For this reason, it is very difficult if not impossible to delineate potential substrates for the putative enzyme based on the occurrence of an FAH domain in a protein of interest. In addition, most known substrates for enzymes of the FAH superfamily, including fumarylacetoacetate, the substrate of the founding member FAH, are not commercially available. In the current study, we circumvented these problems by bioinformatic search for prokaryotic homologs of FAHD1 that would conserve additional features of FAHD1 in addition to the prototypical catalytic domain, referred to as the FAH fold. Advanced BLAST search revealed that a group of eight charged amino acids, which are thought to create the charged environment required for substrate binding in FAHD1 (8Manjasetty B.A. Niesen F.H. Delbrück H. Götz F. Sievert V. Büssow K. Behlke J. Heinemann U. Biol. Chem. 2004; 385: 935-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), were fully conserved in NagK, a well characterized fumarylpyruvate hydrolase from Ralstonia sp. strain U2, but not in other prokaryotic members of the FAH superfamily that are known to catalyze chemical reactions unrelated to acylpyruvate hydrolysis. Based on these findings, we tested the hypothesis that FAHD1 has acylpyruvase activity. Using chemically synthesized acetylpyruvate as substrate, we could confirm this hypothesis. The ability of FAHD1 to break down acetylpyruvate was significantly influenced by the presence of divalent cations, with Mg2+ supporting the highest FAHD1 activity, whereas the identity of the cation bound to FAHD1 in vivo remains to be established. Because the physiological substrate for FAHD1 in vivo is not known at this time (see also below), we considered the possibility that the catalytic activity of FAHD1 shown here could represent a case of promiscuous enzyme activity, a topic increasingly discussed in literature (15Khersonsky O. Tawfik D.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2010; 79: 471-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). To characterize substrate selectivity of the enzyme, three potential substrates with structural homology to acetylpyruvate were tested. This experiment revealed considerable specificity of FAHD1 for acylpyruvate substrates because introduction of a methyl ester group, as in methylacetopyruvate, strongly reduced the ability of FAHD1 to hydrolyze the β-diketone substrate. Although the activity of bacterially produced FAHD1 amounted to about 15% of the activity obtained with a bona fide prokaryotic acetylpyruvate hydrolase (14Davey J.F. Ribbons D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 3826-3830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is conceivable that the activity of the enzyme can be further increased. Besides potential folding problems inherent to the recombinant production of human proteins in E. coli, we consider it likely that maximal activity of FAHD1 may also require posttranslational modifications that are not present in E. coli. This question will be followed up in future studies. Together with the strongly reduced activity of FAHD1 mutant R102A/D106A, data reported here suggest that the ability to hydrolyze acetylpyruvate is an intrinsic property of FAHD1, which is critically dependent on the FAH domain. Acetylpyruvate hydrolase activity was reported previously for FAH, which exhibits a broad substrate specificity toward 2,4- and 3,5-diketo acids (16Mahuran D.J. Angus R.H. Braun C.V. Sim S.S. Schmidt Jr., D.E. Can. J. Biochem. 1977; 55: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Although the precise role of acetylpyruvate hydrolysis in human metabolism has not been established, the disappearance of acetopyruvic acid from various animal tissues was originally reported in 1937 by Sir Hans Krebs and William Johnson (17Krebs H.A. Johnson W.A. Biochem. J. 1937; 31: 772-779Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and later studies confirmed the enzymatic hydrolysis of various acylpyruvates by liver and kidney extracts (18Meister A. Greenstein J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1948; 175: 573-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although FAH activity probably contributes to this reaction in vivo (16Mahuran D.J. Angus R.H. Braun C.V. Sim S.S. Schmidt Jr., D.E. Can. J. Biochem. 1977; 55: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), our finding that FAHD1 is highly expressed in both liver and kidney raises the possibility that part of the acylpyruvate hydrolase activity in these tissues is due to FAHD1. Because FAH is localized to the cytosol (9Kvittingen E.A. Jellum E. Stokke O. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1981; 115: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), whereas FAHD1 is strictly mitochondrial (this study), it is conceivable that both enzymes act in non-redundant pathways. An intriguing finding of the present study is the fact that fumarylpyruvate serves as an in vitro substrate for purified FAHD1, and hydrolysis of fumarylpyruvate is significantly reduced with FAHD1 mutant R102A/D106A. Fumarylpyruvate occurs as a well known metabolite during the enzymatic breakdown of tyrosine and other aromatic compounds in bacteria but has not so far been described in human cells. Tyrosine is metabolized, via 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate, to homogentisate in all organisms. In mammalian cells, homogentisate is further metabolized to fumarylacetoacetate followed by the FAH-dependent hydrolysis to fumarate and acetoacetate. In prokaryotes, an alternative pathway exists where homogentisate is converted to gentisate, which is subsequently converted to maleylpyruvate. In a two-step reaction, maleylpyruvate is converted to fumarylpyruvate, which is then hydrolyzed to fumarate and pyruvate (EC 3.7.1.5), e.g. by fumarylpyruvate hydrolase NagK from Ralstonia sp. strain U2. Although mammalian enzymes that would catalyze this reaction were not described before, the data presented here indicate that human FAHD1 protein can catalyze the same reaction in vitro. However, it remains to be shown whether fumarylpyruvate is a bona fide substrate for human FAHD1 in intact cells. The FAH superfamily appears to have many members in prokaryotes that have no clear homologs in eukaryotes, probably due to the fact that many prokaryotes have developed very specialized metabolic pathways that allow them to metabolize a variety of chemically distinct compounds that cannot be degraded by higher organisms (6Brouns S.J. Barends T.R. Worm P. Akerboom J. Turnbull A.P. Salmon L. van der Oost J. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 379: 357-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, so far three members of the FAH superfamily, FAH, FAHD1, and FAHD2, have been described in eukaryotes, with orthologs in most if not all eukaryotes, including fungi and plants. FAHD2 displays reasonable sequence homology to FAHD1, raising the possibility that the upper signal in Western blot may correspond to a protein related to FAHD1, like the 34-kDa FAHD2 protein. However, FAHD2 protein overexpressed in U-2OS cells was not recognized by affinity-purified FAHD1 antibodies. 5H. Pircher, unpublished. Together with the finding that neither FAHD1 knockdown nor FAHD1 overexpression affected the 32-kDa band, these data strongly indicate that this band represents neither FAHD1 nor FAHD2. Importantly, homologs of these three genes are also found in the human genome, suggesting an important conserved function in all metazoans up to humans. With the notable exception of FAH, not much is known about the function of the FAH superfamily members in higher eukaryotes. The data presented in this study demonstrated, for the first time, a catalytic activity for FAHD1, a member of a growing family of mammalian FAH domain-containing proteins. We expect that the full functional characterization of these proteins and the identification of their presumable catalytic activities will provide new insight in human metabolism. We thank Hermann Unterluggauer and Eveline Hütter for the initial contributions to this work and Lothar Brecker for chemical synthesis of acetylpyruvate. We are grateful to Prof. P. A. Williams, University of Wales, for the kind gift of plasmids encoding enzymes in the Ralstonia sp. strain U2 gentisate metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2048917471,"SUMO proteases can regulate the amounts of SUMO-conjugated proteins in the cell by cleaving off the isopeptidic bond between SUMO and the target protein. Of the six members that constitute the human SENP/ULP protease family, SENP6 and SENP7 are the most divergent members in their conserved catalytic domain. The SENP6 and SENP7 subclass displays a clear proteolytic cleavage preference for SUMO2/3 isoforms. To investigate the structural determinants for such isoform specificity, we have identified a unique sequence insertion in the SENP6 and SENP7 subclass that is essential for their proteolytic activity and that forms a more extensive interface with SUMO during the proteolytic reaction. Furthermore, we have identified a region in the SUMO surface determinant for the SUMO2/3 isoform specificity of SENP6 and SENP7. Double point amino acid mutagenesis on the SUMO surface allows us to swap the specificity of SENP6 and SENP7 between the two SUMO isoforms. Structure-based comparisons combined with biochemical and mutagenesis analysis have revealed Loop 1 insertion in SENP6 and SENP7 as a platform to discriminate between SUMO1 and SUMO2/3 isoforms in this subclass of the SUMO protease family."
https://openalex.org/W2086439592,"N,N'-Dinitrosopiperazine (DNP) is a carcinogen for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), which shows organ specificity to nasopharyngeal epithelium. Herein, we demonstrate that DNP induces fiber formation of NPC cells (6-10B) and also increases invasion and motility of 6-10B cells. DNP-mediated NPC metastasis also was confirmed in nude mice. Importantly, DNP induced the expression of phosphorylated ezrin (phos-ezrin) at threonine 567 (Thr-567) dose- and time-dependently but had no effect on the total ezrin expression at these concentrations. Furthermore, DNP-induced phos-ezrin expression was dependent on increased Rho kinase and protein kinase C (PKC) activity. DNP may activate Rho kinase through binding to its pleckstrin homology and may activate PKC through promoting its translocation to the plasma membrane in vivo. DNP-induced phos-ezrin was associated with induction of fiber growth in 6-10B cells. However, DNP could not induce motility and invasion of NPC cells containing ezrin mutated at Thr-567. Similarly, DNP could not induce motility and invasion of the cells containing siRNAs against Rho or PKC. These results indicate that DNP induces ezrin phosphorylation at Thr-567, increases motility and invasion of cells, and promotes tumor metastasis. DNP may be involved in NPC metastasis through regulation of ezrin phosphorylation at Thr-567."
https://openalex.org/W1995295228,"Calneuron-1 and -2 are neuronal EF-hand-type calcium sensor proteins that are prominently targeted to trans-Golgi network membranes and impose a calcium threshold at the Golgi for phosphatidylinositol 4-OH kinase IIIβ activation and the regulated local synthesis of phospholipids that are crucial for TGN-to-plasma membrane trafficking. In this study, we show that calneurons are nonclassical type II tail-anchored proteins that are post-translationally inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane via an association of a 23-amino acid-long transmembrane domain (TMD) with the TRC40/Asna1 chaperone complex. Following trafficking to the Golgi, calneurons are probably retained in the TGN because of the length of the TMD and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate lipid binding. Both calneurons rapidly self-associate in vitro and in vivo via their TMD and EF-hand containing the N terminus. Although dimerization and potentially multimerization precludes TRC40/Asna1 binding and thereby membrane insertion, we found no evidence for a cytosolic pool of calneurons and could demonstrate that self-association of calneurons is restricted to membrane-inserted protein. The dimerization properties and the fact that they, unlike every other EF-hand calmodulin-like Ca(2+) sensor, are always associated with membranes of the secretory pathway, including vesicles and plasma membrane, suggests a high degree of spatial segregation for physiological target interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1978509911,"Cancer drugs suppress tumor cell growth by inhibiting specific cellular targets. However, most drugs also activate several cellular nonspecific stress pathways, and the implications of these off-target effects are mostly unknown. Here, we report that p38γ, but not p38α, MAPK is specifically activated by treatment of breast cancer cells with topoisomerase II (Topo II) drugs, whereas paclitaxel (Taxol) does not have this effect. The activated p38γ in turn phosphorylates and stabilizes Topo IIα protein, and this enhances the growth inhibition by Topo II drugs. Moreover, p38γ activity was shown to be necessary and sufficient for Topo IIα expression, the drug-p38γ-Topo IIα axis is only detected in intrinsically sensitive but not resistant cells, and p38γ is co-overexpressed with Topo IIα protein in primary breast cancers. These results reveal a new paradigm in which p38γ actively regulates the drug-Topo IIα signal transduction, and this may be exploited to increase the therapeutic activity of Topo II drugs."
https://openalex.org/W1983979081,"The Hedgehog (Hh) pathway is evolutionarily conserved and plays critical roles during embryonic development and adult tissue homeostasis. Defective Hh signaling has been linked to a wide range of birth defects and cancers. Hh family proteins regulate the expression of their downstream target genes through the control of proteolytic processing and the transcriptional activation function of Gli transcription factors. Although Hh-dependent regulation of Gli has been studied extensively, other Gli regulatory mechanisms remain relatively unappreciated. Here we report our identification of a novel signaling cascade that controls the stability of Gli proteins. This cascade consists of Daz interacting protein 1 (Dzip1), casein kinase 2 (CK2), and B56 containing protein phosphatase 2As (PP2As). We provide evidence that Dzip1 is involved in a novel Gli turnover pathway. We show that CK2 directly phosphorylates Dzip1 at four serine residues, Ser-664/665/706/714. B56-containing PP2As, through binding to a domain located between amino acid residue 474 and 550 of Dzip1, dephosphorylate Dzip1 on these CK2 sites. Our mutagenesis analysis further demonstrates that the unphosphorylatable form of Dzip1 is more potent in promoting Gli turnover. Consistently, we found that the stability of Gli proteins was decreased upon CK2 inhibition and increased by inhibition of B56-containing PP2As. Thus, reversible phosphorylation of Dzip1, which is controlled by the antagonistic action of CK2 and B56-containing PP2As, has an important impact on the stability of Gli transcription factors and Hh signaling.

Dysregulation of Hh signaling causes severe consequences ranging from birth defects to the development of basal cell carcinoma, medulloblastoma, and many other tumors (1Ingham P.W. McMahon A.P.

Beachy P.A. Science. 2004; 304: 1755-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). At the molecular level, the Cubitus interruptus (Ci)/Gli family of zinc finger transcription factors act at the downstream end of the Hh signaling cascade to control the expression of Hh target genes. In the absence of Hh signaling, Ci/Gli proteins undergo proteolytic cleavage, leading to production of the repressor forms of Ci/Gli (4Aza-Blanc P. Ramírez-Weber F.A. Laget M.P. Schwartz C.

Hh family proteins operate the pathway by preventing proteolytic processing of Ci/Gli and converting the full-length Ci/Gli into transcriptional activators (7Jiang J. Hui C.C. Dev.

Emerging evidence suggests that the stability of Ci/Gli can be regulated through Hh-independent Gli regulatory mechanisms. In vertebrates, Gli processing requires intact primary cilium, a microtubule-based organelle on the cell surface that is also essential for cells to respond to Hh ligands. Loss of cilia compromises proteolytic processing of Gli3 and prevents the formation of Gli3 repressor (8Haycraft C.J. Banizs B. Aydin-Son Y. Zhang Q. Michaud E.J. Yoder B.K.

Another important Gli regulator in vertebrates is Suppressor of Fused (Sufu), which antagonizes the Spop/Cul3 ubiquitin ligase and protects Gli2 and Gli3 from proteasome degradation (12Chen M.H.

It has been reported that Itch, a critical regulator of Notch, acts together with Numb to regulate Gli1 turnover (17Di Marcotullio L. Greco A. Mazzà D. Canettieri G. Pietrosanti L. Infante P. Coni S.

Several motifs in Gli protein function as degradation signals to mediate proteasome degradation of Gli. Some of these motifs regulate the stability of Gli through as yet unclear mechanisms (19Huntzicker E.G. Estay I.S. Zhen H. Lokteva L.A. Jackson P.K. Oro A.E. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 276-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), arguing for the existence of more Ci/Gli regulatory pathways. PP2A is one of the major Ser/Thr protein phosphatases. PP2A holoenzymes consist of a catalytic subunit (C), scaffold subunit (A), and variable regulatory subunit (B). The catalytic activity, subcellular localization, and substrate specificity of PP2A are regulated by multiple families of regulatory subunits, including B55/B, B56/B′, and PR72/B″ (20Virshup D.M. Shenolikar S. Mol. Cell. 2009; 33: 537-545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). PP2A is an important Ci/Gli regulator. In Drosophila, B56-containing PP2A is required for Hh signaling (21Nybakken K. Vokes S.A. Lin T.Y. McMahon A.P. Perrimon N. Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 1323-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). WDB, a Drosophila B56 family member (22Hannus M. Feiguin F. Heisenberg C.P. Eaton S.

Development. 2009; 136: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In vertebrates, PP2A regulates Hh signaling at the level of Gli as well. It has been observed that PP2As regulate the nuclear localization of Gli3 (24Krauss S. Foerster J. Schneider R. Schweiger S.

To understand the mechanisms by which PP2A regulates Gli, we performed a yeast 2-hybrid screen and identified Dzip1 as a substrate of B56-containing PP2As. Previous studies in zebrafish have revealed that Dzip1 plays a dual role in the Hh pathway. Dzip1 regulates ciliogenesis (27Glazer A.M. Wilkinson A.W. Backer C.B. Lapan S.W. Gutzman J.H.

In this paper, we report that Dzip1 is involved in a Gli turnover pathway. CK2 and B56-containing PP2As influence the Gli turnover function of Dzip1 by controlling reversible phosphorylation of Dzip1. All Dzip1 constructs were derived from mouse Dzip1 (IMAGE: 6825425) and Xenopus Dzip1 (IMAGE: 5511284). Yeast expression constructs (Dzip1, xB56ϵ, hB56α, hB56β, hB56γ1, and xB56δ (33Jin Z. Shi J.

Custom anti-Dzip1 antibodies were generated by New England Peptide. Briefly, a keyhole limpet hemocyanin-coupled peptide (Ac-CAVK(pS)DTDWTEG(pS)EMD-amide) was synthesized and used to immunize rabbits for generating anti-Dzip1 antiserum. Crude sera recognized both unphosphorylated and phosphorylated Dzip1 (supplemental Fig. S1A). After phosphopeptide affinity purification, eluates contained antibodies highly specific to Dzip1 that is phosphorylated on Ser-706/714 (supplemental Fig. S1B). PC6-3, HEK293T, and NIH3T3 cells were cultured as described (34Strack S. Cribbs J.T. Gomez L. J. Biol.

HEK293T cells were used for protein interaction and phosphorylation analysis. NIH3T3 cells were used for all Hh signaling experiments. To replace endogenous Aα with DTP177AAA or wild type (wt) Aα, PC6-3 cells were treated with 1 μg/ml doxycycline (Dox) for 4 days. For okadaic acid (OA) and 4,5,6,7-tetrabromobenzotriazole (TBB) treatment, unless otherwise specified, cells were treated with OA or TBB in DMEM containing 0.5% FBS 1 day after transfection and harvested 18 h after addition of the drug. For dual luciferase assay, cells were transfected with 8×Gli-Luc (200 ng) and pRL-TK (25 ng). Luciferase activities were measured using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Mouse brain and embryonic day 7 whole embryo cDNA libraries were screened using the full-length Xenopus B56ϵ as bait. A total of five millions colonies was screened. To assay the interaction between Dzip1 and B56s, yeast AH109 strain was transformed in combination of pGBKT7 or pGBKT7-Dzip1 with pACT2, pACT2-B56α, pACT2-B56β, pACT2-B56γ, pACT2-B56δ, or pACT2-B56ϵ. Growth of transformants on selective medium was assayed. For λ-protein phosphatase treatment, lysates were treated with 400 units of λ-protein phosphatase (New England Biolabs, #P0753) for 2 h at 30 °C. GST-Dzip1 or Dzip1SA proteins were used for in vitro CK2 (New England Biolabs, #P6010) kinase assay as described (36Jia H. Liu Y. Xia R. Tong C. Yue T. Jiang J. Jia J. J. Biol.

To detect interaction between endogenous Dzip1 and B56ϵ, whole brain protein extract from postnatal day 15 mouse were used. For protein phosphorylation analysis, cells were extracted with lysis buffer containing phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (Sigma). For detection of phosphorylated Dzip1 protein, lysates were separated on 5% SDS-PAGE. Xenopus embryos were obtained as described.

In an effort to understand the mechanisms by which B56-containing PP2As regulate the Hh pathway, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using the full-length B56ϵ as bait. Several clones carrying various lengths of Dzip1 cDNA fragments were identified. Because Dzip1 is involved in Hh signaling (27Glazer A.M. Wilkinson A.W. Backer C.B. Lapan S.W. Gutzman J.H.

Biol. 2004; 14: R668-R670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), we chose to further characterize the potential interaction between B56ϵ and Dzip1. The interaction between B56ϵ and Dzip1 was first analyzed by a GST pulldown assay. An myc-tagged Dzip1 was transfected into HEK293T cells. Cell lysate was incubated with bacterially expressed GST or GST-B56ϵ. We observed that Dzip1 was pulled down by GST-B56ϵ but not by GST (Fig. 1A, left panel). Consistently, myc-Dzip1 was immunoprecipitated by an anti-FLAG antibody when it was coexpressed with B56ϵ-FLAG in HEK293T cells (Fig. 1B), demonstrating that B56ϵ and Dzip1 interact with each other. We then generated Dzip1 deletion constructs (Fig. 1C) and mapped the B56ϵ binding domain of Dzip1. We found that the sequence between amino acid residues 474 and 550 of Dzip1 was sufficient and necessary for B56ϵ binding. GST-B56ϵ pulled down all Dzip1 deletions carrying this domain, including 1–550, 192–852, 285–550, and 474–550. In contrast, all deletions lacking this domain, including 550–852, 1–221, 192–362, and Δ474–550, were not pulled down by GST-B56ϵ (Fig. 1D). This indicates that 474–550 is the B56ϵ interacting domain (BID). Accordingly, Δ474–550 was designated as ΔBID. In a co-immunoprecipitation experiment, Dzip1, but not ΔBID, formed a complex with B56ϵ (Fig. 1E). We further determined whether the interaction between Dzip1 and B56ϵ occurs under physiological conditions. Indeed, endogenous Dzip1 was co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous B56ϵ from P15 whole mouse brain lysate (Fig. 1F). Thus, Dzip1 and B56ϵ physically interact with each other. The interaction between Dzip1 and B56ϵ regulatory subunit of PP2A suggests that PP2A dephosphorylates Dzip1. To test this hypothesis, we first asked whether Dzip1 forms a complex with PP2A holoenzymes. A microcystin pulldown assay was performed to purify PP2Ac, the catalytic subunit of PP2A. We observed that Dzip1, but not EGFP, was co-purified with PP2Ac (Fig. 2A, top panel), demonstrating that Dzip1 forms a complex with PP2A holoenzymes. Moreover, we found that Dzip1 is a phosphoprotein. When separated on 5% SDS-PAGE, two Dzip1 bands were detected. The slower migrating band, which collapsed after a λ-protein phosphatase treatment, is the phosphorylated form of Dzip1 (Fig. 2B). When cells were treated with PP2A inhibitor OA, the amount of the phosphorylated Dzip1 was increased (Fig. 2C). We also noticed that ΔBID, which does not bind to B56ϵ, was hyperphosphorylated in transfected cells (data not shown, also see Fig. 3E). When expressed in Xenopus neural ectoderm, the majority of ΔBID existed in its phosphorylated form (Fig. 2D). Interestingly, the phosphorylation of Dzip1 is not regulated by Hh signaling. Overexpression of Shh in Xenopus embryos (data not shown) or stimulating cells with Smoothened agonist purmorphamine failed to alter the phosphorylation of Dzip1 (Fig. 2E). Purmorphamine treatment markedly induced the expression ptc-1 and gli1 (data not shown, also see Fig. 8D). It appears that PP2A maintains Dzip1 in its dephosphorylated form.FIGURE 3Dephosphorylation of Dzip1 by B56-containing PP2As. A, shown is a summary of the interaction between B56s and Dzip1 in the yeast 2-hybrid system. The number of + symbols indicates the relative binding affinity, as judged by the growth rate of yeast transformants. B, Western blot results show that overexpression of B56ϵ resulted in dephosphorylation of Dzip1. C, Western blot results show dephosphorylation of Dzip1 by B56γ. D, Western blot results show the effect of B56γ overexpression on the phosphorylation status of ΔBID. E, depletion of B56s enhances the phosphorylation of Dzip1. PC6-3 cells were transfected with Dzip1 or ΔBID. Cells were then treated with Dox and subjected to Western blot analysis. Depletion of B56s by Dox-induced Aα → DTP177AAA exchange enhanced phosphorylation of Dzip1 (lanes 1 and 2) but not that of ΔBID (lane 3 and 4). Replacing endogenous Aα with a wt Aα failed to affect Dzip1 phosphorylation (lanes 5–8). Lacking an anti-pan-B56s antibody, we monitored the knockdown efficiency by measuring the level of B56ϵ. Myc-EGFP in B–E served as a control for transfection and loading.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 8The antagonistic action of B56-containing PP2As and CK2 controls the stability of Gli proteins. A, knockdown of B56-containing PP2As in PC6-3 cells by Dox-induced Aα → DTP177AAA exchange enhanced the activity of Gli1 in an 8×Gli luciferase assay. Firefly luciferase activity was normalized to the activity of Renilla luciferase. B, Western blot results show that knockdown of B56-containing PP2As stabilized Gli1, Gli2, and Gli3. C, inhibition of CK2 in NIH3T3 cells by TBB treatment reduced the activity of Gli1 in an 8×Gli luciferase assay. D, inhibition of CK2 reduces purmorphamine-induced expression of gli1 and ptc-1. NIH3T3 cells were treated with purmorphamine alone (PM) or together with various doses of TBB. expression of ptc-1 and gli1 was assayed by real-time RT-PCR. E, Western blot results show that inhibition of CK2 by TBB in NIH3T3 cells decreased the stability of Gli1, Gli2, and Gli3, whereas inhibition of PP2A (OA treatment) increased the level of Gli proteins. When both CK2 and PP2A were inhibited, Gli proteins were degraded, similar to the effect seen when just CK2 was inhibited. F, shown is a working model for regulation of the Gli-destabilizing function of Dzip1 by reversible phosphorylation. CK2 phosphorylated Dzip1. The phosphorylated Dzip1 is less active. B56-containing PP2As, through binding to the BID, dephosphorylate Dzip1 and enhance the Gli-destabilizing function of Dzip1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We then examined the effect of B56ϵ knockdown on Dzip1 phosphorylation. Surprisingly, we found that knockdown of B56ϵ in Xenopus embryos or HEK293T cells failed to cause any detectable change in the phosphorylation of Dzip1 (data not shown), raising the possibility that B56 family members function redundantly to dephosphorylate Dzip1. To test this hypothesis, we examined the interaction between Dzip1 and all five B56 family members using the yeast two-hybrid system. Indeed, co-transformation of Dzip1 with B56s supported the growth of yeast on selection medium (Fig. 3A). This indicates that all B56 family members are capable of binding to Dzip1, although the binding affinities vary as judged by the growth rate of yeast. When overexpressed in HEK293T cells, B56ϵ (Fig. 3B) or B56γ (Fig. 3C) dephosphorylated Dzip1 robustly. Overexpression of B56γ had no effect on the phosphorylation of ΔBID (Fig. 3D), demonstrating that dephosphorylation of Dzip1 by B56s requires physical interaction between Dzip1 and B56s. Overexpression of B56α, B56β, or B56δ had only marginal effects (data not shown). These results suggest that B56-containing PP2As can function redundantly to dephosphorylate Dzip1. We next decided to knock down all five B56s and assayed Dzip1 phosphorylation. The experiment was performed in PC6-3 cells, a specially engineered system allowing Dox inducible knockdown of all five B56s (34Strack S. Cribbs J.T. Gomez L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47732-47739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This system takes advantage of the fact that monomeric B56s are degraded rapidly through the proteasome pathway (34Strack S. Cribbs J.T. Gomez L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47732-47739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 42Li X. Scuderi A. Letsou A. Virshup D.M. Mol. Cell.

U.S.A. 2002; 99: 4221-4226Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). When PC6-3 cells are treated with Dox, endogenous Aα is replaced with DTP177AAA, a mutant form of Aα deficient in binding of B56s but not other PP2A regulatory subunits. This leads to monomerization of B56s and ultimately knockdown of all B56s in PC6-3 cells (34Strack S. Cribbs J.T. Gomez L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47732-47739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 44Van Kanegan M.J. Adams D.G. Wadzinski B.E. Strack S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36029-36036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We also performed our analysis in a control PC6-3 cell line, in which endogenous Aα is replaced with a wt exogenous Aα upon Dox treatment. As shown in Fig. 3E, knockdown of total B56s by Dox-induced Aα → DIP177AAA exchange increased the amount of phosphorylated Dzip1. In contrast, the phosphorylation status of ΔBID was not altered by Dox-induced knockdown of B56s. Furthermore, Dox-induced Aα → wt Aα exchange, which had no effect on B56s, failed to alter the phosphorylation of Dzip1. Thus, knockdown of total B56s enhances phosphorylation of Dzip1. Taken together, we conclude that B56-containing PP2As dephosphorylate Dzip1. Knowing that B56-containing PP2As dephosphorylate Dzip1, we set out to identify the sites of Dzip1 that are dephosphorylated by B56-containing PP2As. Several Dzip1 deletion constructs were generated (Fig. 4A, upper panel). The migration rate of protein on SDS-PAGE was used as a readout for phosphorylation of Dzip1 constructs. As shown in Fig. 4B, all Dzip1 constructs carrying amino acid residues 620–740 (550–852 and 620–740) were phosphorylated, whereas constructs lacking 620–740 (1–550, 550–641, and 739–852) migrated as a single band. The region of 620–740 contains 10 putative kinase recognition sites (Fig. 4A). We mutated these potential phosphorylation sites and assayed the phosphorylation of these Dzip1 mutants in HEK293T cells. Strikingly, mutation of Ser-664, -665, -706, and -714 significantly reduced the amount of phosphorylated Dzip1, whereas mutation of other sites had no effect. Dzip1SA, which carries Ser → Ala mutation on all four serine residues, was no longer band-shifted ("

A lethal mouse model has been utilized which allows investigation of the protective efficacy of active vaccination or passive transfer of vaccine induced sera following lethal H5N1 challenge.We used passive transfer of immune sera to investigate antibody-mediated protection elicited by a Vero cell-derived, non-adjuvanted inactivated whole-virus H5N1 vaccine. Mice were injected intravenously with H5N1 vaccine-induced rodent or human immune sera and subsequently challenged with a lethal dose of wild-type H5N1 virus.Passive transfer of H5N1 vaccine-induced mouse, guinea pig and human immune sera provided dose-dependent protection of recipient mice against lethal challenge with wild-type H5N1 virus. Protective dose fifty values for serum H5N1 neutralizing antibody titers were calculated to be ≤1∶11 for all immune sera, independently of source species.These data underpin the confidence that the Vero cell culture-derived, whole-virus H5N1 vaccine will be effective in a pandemic situation and support the use of neutralizing serum antibody titers as a correlate of protection for H5N1 vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W2043168951,"The 26 S proteasomal complex, which is responsible for the bulk of protein degradation within the cell, recognizes its target substrates via covalently linked polyubiquitin moieties. However, a small but growing number of proteasomal substrates are degraded without a requirement for ubiquitinylation. One such substrate is the pyrimidine biosynthetic enzyme thymidylate synthase (EC 2.1.1.45), which catalyzes the synthesis of TMP and is the sole de novo source of TTP for DNA replication and repair. Previous work showed that intracellular proteolysis of human thymidylate synthase is directed by a degron at the polypeptide's N-terminal end, composed of an intrinsically disordered region (IDR) followed by a highly conserved amphipathic α-helix (hA). In the present report, we show that the hA helix does not function simply as an extension or scaffold for the IDR; rather, it provides a specific structural component that is necessary for degradation. Furthermore, its helical conformation is required for this function. We demonstrate that small domains from heterologous proteins can substitute for the IDR and the hA helix of human thymidylate synthase, indicating that the degradation-promoting function of these regions is not sequence-specific. The results, in general, indicate that cooperation between intrinsically disordered domains and α-helical segments is required for ubiquitin-independent degradation by the proteasome.

For the 26 S proteasome, which has been examined in most detail, the 20 S complex is capped by the 19 S regulatory particle (or PA700) that includes six ATPases organized into a hexameric ring interacting directly with the outer heptameric ring of the 20 S core (3Rechsteiner M.

Studies focusing on the role of the IDR have shown that a free, unmodified amino group at the N terminus and an Arg-Arg dipeptide motif at residues 10–11 are critical to the function of the hTS degron (26Peña M.M.

The mechanisms by which these residues mediate ubiquitin-independent degradation of hTS are not well defined. thymidylate synthase human thymidylate synthase cycloheximide enhanced green fluorescent protein helix A intrinsically disordered region helix-loop-helix prokaryotic ubiquitin-like protein. In the present report, we have examined the roles of both the IDR and the hA helix in more detail. We find that the helix contributes a structural role, rather than simply an extension or scaffold for the IDR; indeed, an α-helical conformation is required for the segment's activity. Both the IDR and the hA helix can be replaced with similarly structured elements from other proteins, indicating that it is conformation (or lack thereof) rather than primary sequence that is required for degron function. The implications of these findings for the mechanism of ubiquitin-independent degradation by the proteasome are discussed. All constructs for mutant analysis were generated using standard molecular biology techniques and were verified directly by DNA sequencing. The parental expression plasmid for hTS, which was used to construct various mutant enzymes, was pJZ205, which contains a full-length hTS cDNA under the control of an SV40 promoter. For expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP), plasmid pMP610, containing a full-length eGFP cDNA under control of a cytomegalovirus promoter, was utilized; the plasmid contains an Escherichia coli TS cDNA (optimized for expression in mammalian cells) under control of a murine stem cell virus LTR promoter. Mutagenesis was carried out by standard PCR-based protocols. Details of all plasmid constructions are available upon request. Cell lines were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cell line RJK88.13, which is a TS-deficient derivative of V79 Chinese hamster lung cells (28Nussbaum R.L. Walmsley R.M. Lesko J.G. Airhart S.D. Ledbetter D.H. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1985; 37: 1192-1205PubMed Google Scholar), was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Cellgro) containing 4.5 g/liter glucose and supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals) and 10 μm thymidine. RJK88.13 cells were transfected with the indicated expression plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 or LTX (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Stable transfectants were selected in thymidine-free medium containing the nucleoside transport inhibitor dipyridamole (5 μm; Sigma-Aldrich). Transfectants were pooled and maintained in mass culture. Protein half-lives were analyzed following the addition of 50 μg/ml cycloheximide (CHX; Acros Organic) to the growth medium for the indicated times. Cells were harvested by scraping and lysed either by sonication (3 × 10 s) in NET2 buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm DTT, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm PMSF, 200 μg/ml aprotinin, 100 μg/ml pepstatin, and 50 μg/ml leupeptin) or resuspension in M-Per® buffer (Pierce). Crude lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, and protein concentrations in the resulting extracts were quantified using the Bio-Rad assay reagent with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Immunoblotting was performed by standard techniques. Probes were monoclonal antibodies to hTS (provided by Dr. Sondra Berger, University of South Carolina), eGFP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) catalog no. sc-9996), or ubiquitin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., catalog no. sc-8017). To control for equal loading, blots were reprobed with an anti-actin monoclonal antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, Clone AC-40). The antigen-antibody complexes were visualized using appropriate secondary antibodies with the ECL chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences). Densitometry was carried out using ImageJ software maintained by the National Institutes of Health. A 2-fold dilution series of each extract was included on the blots for calibration and to correct for film exposure times. All values were normalized to actin concentrations on the same blots. Data were plotted according to first order decay kinetics, and half-lives were determined from the slopes of the resulting lines. Experiments were carried out at least twice and many more times in several cases. Secondary structure analyses were carried out using two prediction tools: Jpred (29Cole C. Barber J.D. Barton G.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: W197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar) maintained by the University of Dundee and PSIpred (30Bryson K. McGuffin L.J. Marsden R.L. Ward J.J. Sodhi J.S. Jones D.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: W36-W38Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar) from the University College London. Generation of the image depicting the three-dimensional structure of the hTS dimer was done using Protein Workshop (31Moreland J.L. Gramada A. Buzko O.V. Zhang Q. Bourne P.E. BMC Bioinformatics. 2005; 6: 21Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), which is maintained on the RCSB Protein Data Bank server. In earlier studies (26Peña M.M. Melo S.P. Xing Y.Y. White K. Barbour K.W. Berger F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 31597-31607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), we identified the N-terminal region of hTS as a degron by ligating amino acids 1–45, spanning the IDR (residues 1–28) and an hA (residues 31–42), to the N terminus of eGFP. CHX chase analysis indicated that this protein, termed N30-hA-eGFP, has a half-life of ∼9–10 h in transfected mammalian cells, as compared with >24 h for the parental eGFP reporter polypeptide (26Peña M.M. Melo S.P. Xing Y.Y. White K. Barbour K.W. Berger F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 31597-31607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Deletion of the hA helix resulted in a molecule, N30-eGFP, that was ∼5-fold more stable than its parent, indicating that the helical segment is required for full activity (26Peña M.M. Melo S.P. Xing Y.Y. White K. Barbour K.W. Berger F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 31597-31607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). As shown in supplemental Fig. 1, treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 causes stabilization of N30-hA-eGFP; in addition, no ubiquitinylated forms can be detected even under conditions where proteasome activity is impeded. Thus, degradation of the reporter substrate is, as expected, proteasome-mediated and ubiquitin-independent. Our earlier studies did not determine whether or not the helix simply provides a scaffold-like extension function to the IDR, as opposed to playing a more specific structural role. To distinguish between these possibilities, we prepared a construct in which the hA segment of N30-hA-eGFP was replaced with a second copy of the IDR, producing two tandem copies of the IDR fused to the N terminus of eGFP. The resulting plasmid, termed N30-N30-eGFP was transfected into the TS-deficient Chinese hamster lung cell line RJK88.13 (26Peña M.M. Melo S.P. Xing Y.Y. White K. Barbour K.W. Berger F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 31597-31607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 28Nussbaum R.L. Walmsley R.M. Lesko J.G. Airhart S.D. Ledbetter D.H. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1985; 37: 1192-1205PubMed Google Scholar); an E. coli TS gene contained within the construct was used to select stable transfectants, based upon their ability to grow in the absence of exogenous thymidine (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). Analysis of the intracellular degradation rate of the N30-N30-eGFP polypeptide showed it to have a half-life of >24 h, which is similar to the unfused eGFP reporter and significantly longer than that for N30-hA-eGFP (Fig. 1, A and C). Thus, a second copy of the IDR, which creates a long, 60-residue disordered domain, does not replace the hA helix in promoting degradation, indicating that the helical segment must provide more than a simple extension function in promoting full degron activity. Some aspect of its sequence and/or structure is likely to be critical. An important question relates to whether or not the secondary structure of the hA segment (i.e. its α-helical conformation) is required for degron function. To address this, we disrupted the helix via targeted introduction of proline residues. Proline is a well known “destabilizer” of helical structure and has been utilized to test the role of α-helices in protein function (32Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1978; 47: 45-148PubMed Google Scholar, 33Kumar S. Bansal M. Proteins. 1998; 31: 460-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 34Mahalingam S. Khan S.A. Murali R. Jabbar M.A. Monken C.E. Collman R.G. Srinivasan A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 3794-3798Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Indeed, analysis of 1,131 α-helices in 205 globular proteins has revealed that proline residues are particularly disfavored at the C-terminal end of helical segments (33Kumar S. Bansal M. Proteins. 1998; 31: 460-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). We predicted, therefore, that Pro substitutions at the C-terminal end of the hA helix should result in profound destabilization of helical conformation. We generated a derivative of N30-hA-eGFP, termed N30-hAP40/P41-eGFP, in which both Ile-40 and Leu-41 at the C-terminal end of the hA helix were converted to Pro. Two secondary structure prediction tools, Jpred (29Cole C. Barber J.D. Barton G.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: W197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar) and PSIpred (30Bryson K. McGuffin L.J. Marsden R.L. Ward J.J. Sodhi J.S. Jones D.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: W36-W38Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar), were used to assess the potential impact of these substitutions. Both predicted an α-helical domain within the wild-type degron at residues 31–42, which is the precise location of the hA helix, as detected by x-ray crystallographic analysis (35Phan J. Steadman D.J. Koli S. Ding W.C. Minor W. Dunlap R.B. Berger S.H. Lebioda L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14170-14177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 36Schiffer C.A. Clifton I.J. Davisson V.J. Santi D.V. Stroud R.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16279-16287Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In contrast, loss of helical conformation within the hA region was predicted for the I40P/L41P mutant. Thus, the structure of the hA helix is likely to be significantly disrupted in the N30-hAP40/P41-eGFP polypeptide. The half-life of this mutant was found to be ∼23 h, indicating it to be stable relative to its parent, N30-hA-eGFP (Fig. 1, B and D). This suggests that an α-helical conformation is necessary for full degron activity. To verify this result, we generated a second mutant, N30-hAP34/P35-eGFP, containing Pro substitutions at positions 34 and 35 within the hA helix. Again, both Jpred and PSIpred predicted disruption of helical conformation within the mutant molecule's hA region. A half-life of ∼19 h was measured for this mutant, indicating it to be quite stable relative to N30-hA-eGFP (Fig. 1, B and D). In sum, the observation that Pro substitutions within the hA segment result in stabilization of the reporter suggests that degron activity requires maintenance of helical propensity. The amphipathic hA helix is highly conserved in mammals (23Carreras C.W. Santi D.V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 721-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar, 26Peña M.M. Melo S.P. Xing Y.Y. White K. Barbour K.W. Berger F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 31597-31607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In the hTS dimer, the two helices lie along the edge of a cleft formed by the interface of the two subunits and are arranged in an antiparallel fashion relative to one another (Fig. 2A). Two charged amino acids near the C-terminal end of the helix (His-39 and Arg-42) face away from the body of the polypeptide into the space created by this cleft. To determine whether or not these residues contribute to degron function, we introduced tryptophan substitutions at both sites within N30-hA-eGFP. The resulting polypeptide, denoted N30-hAW39/W42-eGFP, exhibited a half-life of 1.9 h (Fig. 2, B and C), which is significantly reduced as compared with the 9.8-h half-life observed for N30-hA-eGFP (see Fig. 1). Similarly, substitution of isoleucine at these sites (N30-hAI39/I42-eGFP) also resulted in a very unstable molecule, having a half-life of <1 h (Fig. 2, B and C). Thus, hydrophobic residues at positions 39 and 42 result in marked destabilization of the reporter, indicating that the amino acids at these sites are important determinants of degradation-promoting activity. Apparently, the wild-type hTS degron, containing positively charged His and Arg at these positions, is less than maximally active. The primary sequence of the IDR at the N-terminal end of hTS varies extensively among mammalian species (26Peña M.M. Melo S.P. Xing Y.Y. White K. Barbour K.W. Berger F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 31597-31607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Despite this high degree of variation, the region in several species is still capable of contributing to degron function, so long as it has a free N-terminal end and an Arg-Arg motif at or near residues 10–11 (26Peña M.M. Melo S.P. Xing Y.Y. White K. Barbour K.W. Berger F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 31597-31607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 27Melo S.P. Yoshida A. Berger F.G. Biochem. J. 2010; 432: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Thus, a disordered character rather than a specific primary sequence may be a central feature of the role of the IDR in degradation. This leads to the prediction that disordered domains from distinct proteins might be capable of replacing the hTS IDR with respect to its role in degradation. To test this notion, we introduced a distinct disordered domain, specifically residues 20–38 from the chicken fibrinogen-α polypeptide (37Yang Z. Kollman J.M. Pandi L. Doolittle R.F. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12515-12523Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), into hTS in place of amino acids 7–29 of the endogenous IDR. The resulting polypeptide, termed FIB-hTS, contains the first six amino acids of hTS (1MPVAGS6), the disordered region of fibrinogen-α, and residues 30–313 of hTS. The six hTS-derived residues were retained at the N terminus to protect against N-α-acetylation, a process that can lead to degradation resistance (26Peña M.M. Melo S.P. Xing Y.Y. White K. Barbour K.W. Berger F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 31597-31607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). FIB-hTS exhibited a half-life of 3.7 h (Fig. 3, A and C), which is similar to that for wild-type hTS (26Peña M.M. Melo S.P. Xing Y.Y. White K. Barbour K.W. Berger F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 31597-31607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 27Melo S.P. Yoshida A. Berger F.G. Biochem. J. 2010; 432: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In addition, as is also shown in Fig. 3, A and C, the molecule was stabilized by a Pro-2 Ala replacement within the hTS moiety at the N terminus; this substitution is known to promote N-α-acetylation and to stabilize wild-type hTS (25Peña M.M. Xing Y.Y. Koli S. Berger F.G. Biochem. J. 2006; 394: 355-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 26Peña M.M. Melo S.P. Xing Y.Y. White K. Barbour K.W. Berger F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 31597-31607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Thus, the IDR of fibrinogen-α is capable of promoting degradation of full-length hTS and operates by a similar mechanism as the native IDR within hTS. To show that the fibrinogen-α segment contributes to degron activity, we inserted it into N30-hA-eGFP in place of amino acids 7–29 of the hTS IDR. The polypeptide, denoted FIB-hA-GFP, contains the first six amino acids of hTS (1MPVAGS6), followed by residues 20–38 of fibrinogen-α and the hA helix, all appended to the N-terminal end of the eGFP reporter. Again, the six residues of hTS were retained at the N terminus to protect against the potentially stabilizing impact of N-α-acetylation. The protein exhibited a half-life of ∼5 h (Fig. 3, B and D), which is similar to N30-hA-eGFP (see Fig. 1). As expected, degradation of FIB-hA-eGFP is proteasome-mediated and ubiquitin-independent (see supplemental Fig. 1). Thus, the fibrinogen-α segment can replace the IDR of hTS in promoting degradation of the eGFP reporter. In order to test the dependence of FIB-hA-eGFP degradation on the hA helix, we generated a polypeptide, FIB-eGFP, which lacks the hA helical segment. This protein exhibited a half-life of >24 h (Fig. 3, B and D), indicating it to be at least 5-fold more stable than FIB-hA-eGFP. In all, the results indicate that the IDR of fibrinogen-α, like that of hTS, cooperates with a helical motif in forming a functional degron. The highly mobile N-terminal “headpiece” domain of the E. coli lac repressor (residues 1–45) has been shown to provide a disordered region necessary for ubiquitin-directed proteasomal degradation (38Prakash S. Tian L. Ratliff K.S. Lehotzky R.E. Matouschek A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 830-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). To test the ability of the domain to replace the IDR of hTS in driving degradation, we inserted it into hTS in place of amino acids 7–29 of the endogenous IDR. The encoded polypeptide, termed LAC-hTS, contains the first six amino acids of hTS (1MPVAGS6, to protect against N-α-acetylation) followed by residues 2–38 of the lac repressor and 30–313 of hTS. Degradation rate assays showed that LAC-hTS is a very unstable molecule, having a half-life of 0.56 h (Fig. 4, A and C). In addition, as is the case for wild-type hTS, it is stabilized by the acetylation-promoting Pro-2 Ala substitution within the small segment of hTS at its N-terminal end (Fig. 4, A and C). Thus, the lac repressor region effectively replaces the hTS IDR with regard to its ability to promote degradation. Data presented in supplemental Fig. 1 indicate that LAC-hA-eGFP degradation is proteasome-mediated and ubiquitin-independent. To assess degron function, we inserted the repressor segment into N30-hA-eGFP in place of amino acids 7–29 of the hTS IDR. The encoded polypeptide, denoted LAC-hA-eGFP, contains the first six residues of hTS, followed by the repressor domain and the hA helix, all attached to the N-terminal end of the eGFP reporter. The molecule exhibited a very short half-life of 0.34 h (Fig. 4, B and D), indicating it to be significantly less stable than the native eGFP reporter. Thus, the lac repressor segment shows very strong degron activity, exceeding that of the hTS IDR. To test whether or not degron activity exhibited by the repressor region depends upon the hA helix, we removed the hA segment. The resulting polypeptide, denoted LAC-eGFP, had a half-life of 1.0 h, which is slightly more stable than LAC-hA-eGFP (Fig. 4, B and D) but much less stable than eGFP (see Fig. 1). Thus, the lac repressor region exhibits strong degron activity even in the absence of the hA helix. The region acts on its own as a powerful degron independently of the hA helix. Structural studies have shown that the headpiece region is not completely disordered but contains a helix-loop-helix motif (HLH) spanning residues 9–29 (39Slijper M. Bonvin"
https://openalex.org/W2134393964,"Mariner-like elements (MLEs) are widespread transposable elements in animal genomes. They have been divided into at least five sub-families with differing host ranges. We investigated whether the ability of transposases encoded by Mos1, Himar1 and Mcmar1 to be actively imported into nuclei varies between host belonging to different eukaryotic taxa. Our findings demonstrate that nuclear importation could restrict the host range of some MLEs in certain eukaryotic lineages, depending on their expression level. We then focused on the nuclear localization signal (NLS) in these proteins, and showed that the first 175 N-terminal residues in the three transposases were required for nuclear importation. We found that two components are involved in the nuclear importation of the Mos1 transposase: an SV40 NLS-like motif (position: aa 168 to 174), and a dimerization sub-domain located within the first 80 residues. Sequence analyses revealed that the dimerization moiety is conserved among MLE transposases, but the Himar1 and Mcmar1 transposases do not contain any conserved NLS motif. This suggests that other NLS-like motifs must intervene in these proteins. Finally, we showed that the over-expression of the Mos1 transposase prevents its nuclear importation in HeLa cells, due to the assembly of transposase aggregates in the cytoplasm."

Gene expression profiles associated with renal fibrosis have been attenuated through Wnt pathway modulation in model systems implicating Wnt pathway members as potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy. We assessed tag and potentially functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; n = 31) in four key Wnt pathway genes (CTNNB1, AXIN2, LRP5 and LRP6) for association with diabetic nephropathy using a case-control design.SNPs were genotyped using Sequenom or Taqman technologies in 1351 individuals with type 1 diabetes (651 cases with nephropathy and 700 controls without nephropathy). Cases and controls were white and recruited from the UK and Ireland. Association analyses were performed using PLINK, to compare allele and haplotype frequencies in cases and controls. Adjustment for multiple testing was performed by permutation testing.Following logistic regression analysis adjusted by collection centre, duration of T1D, and average HbA1c as covariates, a single SNP in LRP6 (rs1337791) was significantly associated with DN (OR = 0.74; CI: 0.57-0.97; P = 0.028), although this was not maintained following correction for multiple testing. Three additional SNPs (rs2075241 in LRP6; rs3736228 and rs491347 both in LRP5) were marginally associated with diabetic nephropathy, but none of the associations were replicated in an independent dataset. Haplotype and subgroup analysis (according to duration of diabetes, and end-stage renal disease) also failed to reveal an association with diabetic nephropathy.Our results suggest that analysed common variants in CTNNB1, AXIN2, LRP5 and LRP6 are not strongly associated with diabetic nephropathy in type 1 diabetes among white individuals. Our findings, however, cannot entirely exclude these genes or other members of the Wnt pathway, from involvement in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy as our study had limited power to detect variants with small effect size."
https://openalex.org/W2071800646,"Biliary atresia is a common disease in neonates which causes obstructive jaundice and progressive hepatic fibrosis. Our previous studies indicate that rotavirus infection is an initiator in the pathogenesis of experimental biliary atresia (BA) through the induction of increased nuclear factor-kappaB and abnormal activation of the osteopontin inflammation pathway. In the setting of rotavirus infection, rotavirus nonstructural protein 4 (NSP4) serves as an important immunogen, viral protein 7 (VP7) is necessary in rotavirus maturity and viral protein 4 (VP4) is a virulence determiner. The purpose of the current study is to clarify the roles of NSP4, VP7 and VP4 in the pathogenesis of experimental BA. Primary cultured extrahepatic biliary epithelia were infected with Rotavirus (mmu18006). Small interfering RNA targeting NSP4, VP7 or VP4 was transfected before rotavirus infection both in vitro and in vivo. We analyzed the incidence of BA, morphological change, morphogenesis of viral particles and viral mRNA and protein expression. The in vitro experiments showed NSP4 silencing decreased the levels of VP7 and VP4, reduced viral particles and decreased cytopathic effect. NSP4-positive cells had strongly positive expression of integrin subunit α2. Silencing of VP7 or VP4 partially decreased epithelial injury. Animal experiments indicated after NSP4 silencing, mouse pups had lower incidence of BA than after VP7 or VP4 silencing. However, 33.3% of VP4-silenced pups (N = 6) suffered BA and 50% of pups (N = 6) suffered biliary injury after VP7 silencing. Hepatic injury was decreased after NSP4 or VP4 silencing. Neither VP4 nor VP7 were detected in the biliary ducts after NSP4. All together, NSP4 silencing down-regulates VP7 and VP4, resulting in decreased incidence of BA."
https://openalex.org/W2084512098,"Protein histidine phosphatase (PHP) is an enzyme which removes phosphate groups from histidine residues. It was described for vertebrates in the year 2002. The recombinant human 16 kDa protein forms multimeric complexes in physiological buffer and in the gas phase. High-mass calibration in matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) has remained a problem due to the lack of suitable standards. Large proteins can hardly be freed of their substructural microheterogeneity by classical purification procedures so that their use as calibrants is limited. A small adduct-forming protein of validated quality is a valuable alternative for that purpose.Three major PHP clusters of ∼113, 209 and >600 kDa were observed in gel filtration analysis. Re-chromatography of the monomer peak showed the same cluster distribution. The tendency to associate was detected also in MALDI-TOF MS measuring regular adducts up to 200 kDa.PHP forms multimers consisting of up to more than 35 protein molecules. In MALDI-TOF MS it generates adduct ions every 16 kDa. The protein can be produced with high quality so that its use as calibration compound for high mass ranges above 100 kDa, where standards are difficult to obtain, is feasible."
https://openalex.org/W2003862743,"Numerous inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir) channels possess an aromatic residue in the helix bundle crossing region, forming the narrowest pore constriction in crystal structures. However, the role of the Kir channel bundle crossing as a functional gate remains uncertain. We report a unique phenotype of Kir6.2 channels mutated to encode glutamate at this position (F168E). Despite a prediction of four glutamates in close proximity, Kir6.2(F168E) channels are predominantly closed at physiological pH, whereas alkalization causes rapid and reversible channel activation. These findings suggest that F168E glutamates are uncharged at physiological pH but become deprotonated at alkaline pH, forcing channel opening due to mutual repulsion of nearby negatively charged side chains. The potassium channel pore scaffold likely brings these glutamates close together, causing a significant pKa shift relative to the free side chain (as seen in the KcsA selectivity filter). Alkalization also shifts the apparent ATP sensitivity of the channel, indicating that forced motion of the bundle crossing is coupled to the ATP-binding site and may resemble conformational changes involved in wild-type Kir6.2 gating. The study demonstrates a novel mechanism for engineering extrinsic control of channel gating by pH and shows that conformational changes in the bundle crossing region are involved in ligand-dependent gating of Kir channels.

Alkalization also shifts the apparent ATP sensitivity of the channel, indicating that forced motion of the bundle crossing is coupled to the ATP-binding site and may resemble conformational changes involved in wild-type Kir6.2 gating. The study demonstrates a novel mechanism for engineering extrinsic control of channel gating by pH and shows that conformational changes in the bundle crossing region are involved in ligand-dependent gating of Kir channels. Inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir) channels comprise a transmembrane pore-forming domain conserved within the cation channel superfamily(1Kubo Y. Adelman J.P. Clapham D.E. Jan L.Y. Karschin A.

In contrast to their voltage-dependent cousins (Kv, Nav, and Cav channel families), Kir channels do not possess a canonical voltage-sensing domain (2Kubo Y. Reuveny E. Slesinger P.A. Jan Y.N.

Rather, their ligand sensitivities and gating behaviors are determined by a cytoplasmic ligand-binding domain, and apparent voltage sensitivity in the physiological milieu arises from blockade by intracellular cations (Mg2+ and polyamines) (6Lopatin A.N. Makhina E.N. Nichols C.G. Nature. 1994; 372: 366-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). Kir channels exhibit diverse ligand dependence: some are regulated by G-proteins, others by intracellular nucleotides, and still others by intracellular pH, whereas all Kir channels are stimulated by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) 2The abbreviation used is: PIP2phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate.

Kir6.x channels are the pore-forming subunits of ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels. They are distinguished from other Kir channels by their sensitivity to intracellular nucleotides (ATP and ADP), and the uniquely diverse pharmacology of KATP makes these channels a valuable model for characterizing Kir channel gating (5Inagaki N.

Many Kir channel types (most notably the G-protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) and KATP channels) possess a conserved aromatic residue at the helix bundle crossing (see Fig. 1, A and B), also the locus of the narrowest pore constriction in crystal structures of bacterial Kir homologs (Phe-146 in KirBac1.1 and Tyr-132 in KirBac3.1) (see Fig. 1B) (14Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Antcliff J.F. Rahman T. Lowe E.D. Zimmer J. Cuthbertson J. Ashcroft F.M. Ezaki T. Doyle D.A. Science. 2003; 300: 1922-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). Although crystal structures suggest that this position is important for Kir channel closure, the notion of a functional gate at the Kir channel bundle crossing has been frequently questioned (15Proks P. Antcliff J.F. Ashcroft F.M. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 70-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 16Claydon T.W. Makary S.Y. Dibb K.M. Boyett M.R. J. Biol.

Cell. 2010; 141: 1018-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). We undertook a mutagenic approach to investigate the functional importance of residues in the bundle crossing region and inner cavity of Kir6.2 (19Kurata H.T. Phillips L.R. Rose T. Loussouarn G. Herlitze S. Fritzenschaft H. Enkvetchakul D. Nichols C.G. Baukrowitz T. J. Gen. Physiol. 2004; 124: 541-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Through these studies, we have uncovered several mechanisms for extrinsic/non-natural control of Kir6.2 gating. We previously reported a point mutation that introduces voltage-dependent gating into normally voltage-independent Kir6.2 (20Kurata H.T. Rapedius M. Kleinman M.J. Baukrowitz T. Nichols C.G. PLoS Biol. 2010; 8: e1000315Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Here, we report the generation of Kir6.2 channels with a very pronounced pH-dependent gating mechanism that arises after introduction of a glutamate residue at the helix bundle crossing position (Phe-168). Our findings indicate that deprotonation of the F168E glutamate drives channel opening, likely due to a mutual repulsion of similar charges in the bundle crossing. Additionally, we demonstrate that conformational changes driven by the engineered pH dependence are closely related to gating motions arising from intrinsic ATP/PIP2-dependent gating. These results demonstrate the importance of conformational motions in the helix bundle crossing of Kir channels and illustrate general principles that underlie a mechanism for extrinsic or “engineered” control of ion channel gating. All mutant channel constructs were generated from a mouse WT Kir6.2 gene expressed in the pcDNA3.1(−) plasmid (Invitrogen). Point mutations were introduced by overlapping PCR-based methods, followed by subcloning of desired fragments into pcDNA3.1(−). Concatenated channel constructs were synthesized using PCR amplification of individual subunits with primers that introduced the desired flanking restriction sites, followed by subcloning into the pcDNA3.1(−) vector and verification by sequencing and digestion. Tetrameric channels were first constructed as two separate dimers to simplify sequencing and then combined into a final tetrameric construct. Channel subunits were subcloned between the XbaI-NotI (“slot 1”), NotI-EcoRI (“slot 2”), EcoRI-BamHI (“slot 3”), and BamHI-HindIII (“slot 4”) restriction sites. Gly6 linkers were included at the C-terminal end of each subunit in the tetramer, followed by two (or three for NotI) amino acids corresponding to the introduced restriction sites. Start codons in slots 2–4 were removed to minimize spurious translation initiation within the tetrameric constructs. A C-terminal GFP tag was also included in the tetrameric channel constructs to track synthesis of full-length tetramers. We found empirically that currents from cells transfected with the tetrameric constructs matured more slowly than those from cells transfected with the monomeric constructs, and the GFP tag assisted significantly in finding strongly expressing cells. COSm6 cells were maintained in culture in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were transfected with channel constructs and hamster SUR1 using Lipofectamine 2000. For non-GFP-tagged constructs, cells were also transfected with a GFP plasmid to allow selection of transfected cells for recording. Kir6.2ΔC36 constructs were expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Ambion mMESSAGE T7 kits were used to synthesize mRNA from pcDNA3.1(−) constructs encoding either Kir6.2ΔC36 or Kir6.2(F168E)ΔC36, followed by injection (10–20 ng) into Xenopus oocytes 1 day after isolation. Inside-out patches were excised from oocytes 1–3 days after injection. Data were filtered at 1 kHz, digitized at 5 kHz, and stored directly on a computer hard drive using Clampex software (Axon Inc.). The standard pipette (extracellular) and bath (cytoplasmic) solution used in these experiments had the following composition: 140 mm KCl, 1 mm K-EGTA, 1 mm K-EDTA, and 4 mm K2HPO4. The solution pH was adjusted with KOH or HCl to the desired level. Because the recording solutions are not very strongly buffered, the solution pH was verified each experimental day and verified after the addition of other solutes that can affect solution pH (namely Ba2+ and ATP). Solutions were delivered at room temperature by pressure-driven flow into a chamber designed to prevent mixing of experimental solutions and to allow rapid solution exchange. Identical solutions were used for recordings from both mammalian cell lines and Xenopus oocytes. Chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich or Fisher. COSm6 cells in 6-well plates were transfected with Kir6.2 channel cDNA (600 ng) and FLAG-tagged SUR1 (1.2 μg in the pECE vector). After 3 days of incubation, cell surface proteins were isolated by biotinylation (Pierce cell surface protein isolation kit). Western blotting was carried out with samples of total cell lysates, as well as biotinylated fractions, using 7.5% SDS-PAGE, followed by transfer to nitrocellulose membrane and labeling with mouse anti-FLAG primary antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) and HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (ABM, Vancouver, Canada). Blots were visualized by ECL methods (Femto ECL detection kit, Pierce) using a FluorChem SP gel imager (Alpha Innotech). We observed an unexpected phenotype in Kir6.2 channels with a glutamate substitution at Phe-168 (at the helix bundle crossing). A reasonable prediction for this experiment was that close proximity of charged glutamate side chains might force the M2 helices apart and thereby bias the channels toward an open state. Surprisingly, we observed that Kir6.2(F168E) ion channels conducted very little current around pH 7. However, intracellular alkalization (using inside-out patch recordings) caused a very large current increase (Fig. 1D). This activation was rapid and completely reversible, and currents exhibited voltage-dependent block by Ba2+ and spermine (Fig. 1D), demonstrating that the pH-dependent currents are carried by Kir6.2(F168E). A good measure of the pKa of the effect was not possible because the response did not saturate without significant seal breakdown (usually above pH 9). Remarkably, the alkaline pH-dependent activation of Kir6.2(F168E) was completely reversed from the WT Kir6.2 property of inhibition by alkalization (Fig. 1C) (21Xu H. Wu J. Cui N. Abdulkadir L. Wang R. Mao J. Giwa L.R. Chanchevalap S. Jiang C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38690-38696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We speculated that glutamate substitution at position 168 results in a profound pKa shift of the side chain carboxylic acid. When glutamates and/or aspartates are nearby, a pKa shift of the carboxylic acid reduces the energetic penalty arising from close approach of like charges and can be especially dramatic if the side chains are in a hydrophobic environment (22Lindman S. Linse S. Mulder F.A. André I. Biophys. J. 2007; 92: 257-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This often appears as two carboxylates sharing a proton or one behaving as a protonated (uncharged) species, thereby minimizing repulsive coulombic interactions. In studies of ion channels, the best known example of this arrangement appears in the KcsA selectivity filter, where the Glu-71 and Asp-80 side chains are apposed and are presumed to share a proton (Fig. 2C). A similar arrangement is apparent in KirBac1.1 (23Berneche S. Roux B. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 772-780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2C). A satisfactory explanation for the pH dependence of F168E channels might be that alkalization promotes deprotonation of the carboxylates and forces a conformational change of the helix bundle crossing due to mutual repulsion (Fig. 2, A and B). To test whether alkalization-dependent activation of Kir6.2(F168E) requires mutual repulsion of F168E charges, we generated tetrameric constructs with one, two, or three F168E subunits. Significant alkalization-dependent activation was observed for channel constructs with two (FFEE or FEFE, with different orientations of F168E subunits in the tetramer) or three (FEEE) copies of F168E (Fig. 3, A–C and G). However, channels carrying a single F168E (FFFE) did not exhibit alkalization-dependent activation (Fig. 3, D and G). Additionally, 1:1 dimers of WT and Kir6.2(F168E) channels were activated by alkalization (Fig. 3G, 'FE'+'FE'). The degree of alkalization-dependent activation was notably weaker in the FE dimeric construct. We have not investigated this in great detail but suspect that this may be related to a higher intrinsic open probability of this construct (which would limit the extent of activation that could occur). A similar effect is discussed below for Kir6.2(F168E/I296L) mutant channels in Fig. 8.FIGURE 8Open state stability mutations affect the phenotype of Kir6.2(F168E) channels. Representative inside-out patch records are presented for Kir6.2(F168E/I296L) (A) and Kir6.2(F168E/R176A) (B) channels, with pH jumps as indicated. C, summary data for both mutant channels (n = 4 for I296L and n = 7 for R176A).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Importantly, previous studies of tetrameric Kir6.2 channel constructs have reported a high intrinsic open probability (24Craig T.J. Ashcroft F.M. Proks P. J. Gen. Physiol. 2008; 132: 131-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 25Shyng S. Ferrigni T. Nichols C.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 110: 141-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). To ensure that the absence of alkalization-dependent activation of FFFE channels did not arise because of an intrinsically high Po (from which little further channel activation could be observed), we also examined the effects of pH after polylysine-mediated rundown. After polylysine treatment resulting in ∼60% current reduction, inhibition upon alkalization persisted, similar to WT Kir6.2 (Fig. 3D, panels i and ii). These findings indicate that at least two copies of the F168E mutation are required for alkalization-dependent activation, consistent with a mechanism of mutual repulsion of F168E. Alkalization-dependent activation of Kir6.2(F168E) channels does not rely on the presence of a SUR subunit. We expressed WT and Kir6.2(F168E) channels in the absence of SUR by deleting the C-terminal 36 amino acids (26Tucker S.J. Gribble F.M. Zhao C. Trapp S. Ashcroft F.M. Nature. 1997; 387: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). Similar to full-length channels expressed with SUR1, F168E channels exhibited alkalization-dependent activation, whereas WT Kir6.2 channels were inhibited over a similar pH range (Fig. 3, E–G). Patch clamp records resolving single channel openings demonstrate that alkalization promotes opening of Kir6.2(F168E). Fig. 4A depicts a representative membrane patch switched repeatedly between pH 6.5 and 8.5, demonstrating increased channel activity at alkaline pH. Expanded segments of the recording (Fig. 4B, panels i–iii) highlight that there are no apparent differences in single channel current amplitude, but channel Po is pH-dependent. Also, single channel conductance was ∼80 picosiemens at −50 mV, comparable with reports for WT Kir6.2 (20Kurata H.T. Rapedius M. Kleinman M.J. Baukrowitz T. Nichols C.G. PLoS Biol. 2010; 8: e1000315Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 24Craig T.J. Ashcroft F.M. Proks P. J. Gen. Physiol. 2008; 132: 131-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 27Lorenz E.

These findings indicate that alkalization of F168E channels increases current by promoting channel opening rather than increasing microscopic conductance. Alkalization-dependent activation conferred by the F168E mutation appears to be position-specific, as glutamate substitutions at other pore-lining positions did not exhibit similar pH-dependent activation (Fig. 5). There are also several titratable side chains in the vicinity of F168E (His-70, Lys-170, and His-175), raising the possibility of pH-dependent salt bridges between side chains (Fig. 6A). We ruled this out by systematically neutralizing His-70, Lys-170, and His-175 on a Kir6.2(F168E) background. Each double mutant channel exhibited alkalization-dependent activation comparable with Kir6.2(F168E) (Fig. 6, B–E). Importantly, His-175 has been identified as a determinant of intrinsic pH sensitivity in Kir6.2 (28Wang R. Su J. Zhang X. Shi Y. Cui N. Onyebuchi V.A. Jiang C. J. Membr. Biol. 2006; 213: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Persistence of alkalization-dependent activation in Kir6.2(F168E/H175A) double mutant channels indicates that the pH dependence of the F168E mutation does not arise from a modulation of the intrinsic pH sensor of the channel. Overall, these data indicate that the F168E mutation is sufficient for alkalization-dependent activation and that pH changes likely trigger a conformational change in the vicinity of the F168E substitution.FIGURE 6Neutralization of titratable residues near F168E. A, molecular model of the bundle crossing region of Kir6.2. B–E, double mutants Kir6.2(H70A/F168E) (n = 7), Kir6.2(F168E/K170A) (n = 7), and Kir6.2(F168E/H175A) (n = 5) were examined for pH dependence. All double mutants exhibited alkalization-dependent activation comparable with Kir6.2(F168E) channels.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We also determined the cell surface expression level of Kir6.2(F168E) by assessing the presence of a mature glycosylated form of SUR1 (indicated by arrows in Fig. 7). Interestingly, we were unable to detect functional currents from Kir6.2(F168D) channels despite the similarity of aspartate and glutamate side chains, so cell surface expression of F168D channels was also examined, along with WT Kir6.2. For all channel + FLAG-SUR1 combinations examined, two FLAG-SUR1 bands were detected by Western blotting (Fig. 7A). F168E channels consistently generated smaller protein levels relative to WT or Kir6.2(F168D) channels and required longer exposures to convincingly resolve bands (Fig. 7A, boxed). FLAG-SUR1 migration on SDS-PAGE is interpreted with the lower band corresponding to a core-glycosylated immature form and the upper band corresponding to a mature glycosylated form expressed at the cell surface (29Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar, 30Yan F.F. Casey J. Shyng S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 33403-33413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We confirmed the validity of this interpretation by demonstrating that FLAG-SUR1 expression in the absence of Kir6.2 failed to generate the mature glycosylated form (Fig. 7A) and that cell surface biotinylation isolated only the upper band (Fig. 7B). These findings demonstrate that Kir6.2(F168E) and Kir6.2(F168D) channels are trafficked with efficiency similar to WT Kir6.2. However, Kir6.2(F168D) channels are not sufficient to generate functional currents over the pH range tested in our experiments. We tested whether the pH-influenced activity of Kir6.2(F168E) is related to the intrinsic channel gating mechanism. First, we introduced the F168E mutation together with a gain-of-function Kir6.2 mutation (I296L) that acts by increasing channel open probability (31Koster J.C. Remedi M.S. Dao C. Nichols C.G. Diabetes. 2005; 54: 2645-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 32Proks P. Girard C. Haider S. Gloyn A.L. Hattersley A.T. Sansom M.S. Ashcroft F.M. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 470-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The Kir6.2(F168E/I296L) double mutant exhibited large currents at acidic pH and was weakly potentiated upon alkalization (Fig. 8, A and C). In many patches, pH-activated currents from Kir6.2(F168E/I296L) appeared to saturate at alkaline pH (Fig. 8A). These data suggest that the Kir6.2(F168E/I296L) channels exhibit a high open probability at low pH. In a complementary experiment, we used the R176A mutation (which disrupts PIP2 sensitivity) to generate channels with low open probability (Fig. 8B) (33Shyng S.L. Cukras C.A. Harwood J. Nichols C.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 599-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In Kir6.2(F168E/R176A) double mutant channels, very little current activation was observed until the most extreme alkaline pH, consistent with a greater stimulus required to force these channels open. These findings further support that alkalization of Kir6.2(F168E) channels modulates the native gating mechanism. To test stringently whether pH-dependent activation of F168E channels resembles channel gating, we examined whether pH affects ligand sensitivity. To preface this experiment, note that the ATP-binding site is allosterically coupled to the channel gate, and therefore, manipulations (e.g. mutations, changes in lipid conditions) that change the stability of open versus closed states also alter the apparent Kir6.2 channel ATP sensitivity (Fig. 9E) (7Shyng S.L. Nichols C.G. Science. 1998; 282: 1138-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 8Baukrowitz T. Schulte U. Oliver D. Herlitze S. Krauter T. Tucker S.J. Ruppersberg J.P. Fakler B. Science. 1998; 282: 1141-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 34Enkvetchakul D. Loussouarn G. Makhina E. Shyng S.L. Nichols C.G. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 2334-2348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). For instance, as membrane PIP2 content (and consequently, channel Po) is increased, ATP inhibition of Kir6.2 grows progressively weaker. If motions triggered by alkalization affect opening and closing transitions at the same gate that is operated by the native ATP regulatory mechanism, then pH-induced changes in the closed-open equilibrium of Kir6.2(F168E) channels may translate into changes in apparent ATP sensitivity, similar to the effects of increased membrane PIP2. We tested this possibility by measuring ATP sensitivity at various internal pH values (Fig. 9, A–D). In WT Kir6.2 channels, internal pH had little effect on ATP inhibition (Fig. 9, A and B), ruling out a nonspecific effect of pH on ATP binding. In contrast, Kir6.2(F168E) channels exhibited significantly weakened ATP inhibition at alkaline pH (Fig. 9, C and D). Thus, Kir6.2(F168E) channels are reasonably well inhibited by ATP but with a sensitivity that is modified by internal pH. This indicates that pH-dependent conformational changes in Kir6.2(F168E) channels are likely coupled to the ATP-binding site and resemble gating motions in WT Kir6.2 channels. Another interesting feature of these data is that ATP inhibition of Kir6.2(F168E) did not eliminate macroscopic currents, resulting in a plateau of conductance (asterisk in Fig. 9D, pH 7.3). We have confirmed that the plateau persists at very high ATP concentrations and that currents can be inhibited by spermine (Fig. 10), indicating that the plateau current is carried by Kir6.2(F168E) channels. However, the mechanistic basis for this plateau is unclear. One intriguing possibility is that the glutamate substitution results in a “leaky” closed state, in which channels are in a quasi-closed ATP-bound conformation, but the pore is not completely occluded due to ablation of the Phe-168 aromatic residue. Such partial closings were not apparent in single channel records, but it is noteworthy that the plateau current was best resolved (Fig. 10) at pH 7.3 (where Po is quite low). Therefore, the relative magnitude of the plateau to control (0 ATP) current would not represent the true conductance ratio of a leaky closed state to a fully open state because all closed channels could contribute to the plateau conductance, whereas at pH 7.3, only a small fraction of channels would be likely to open in 0 ATP. Most Kir channel crystal structures have captured a presumed closed state with a narrow constriction in the bundle crossing region (14Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Antcliff J.F. Rahman T. Lowe E.D. Zimmer J.

EMBO J. 2007; 26: 4005-4015Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). KirBac3.1 is the only Kir channel with structural data that may represent multiple channel states: a cryo-EM study modeled substantial rearrangements of the inner M2 helices during channel opening (comparable with the differences between the KcsA and MthK structures) (36Kuo A. Domene C. Johnson L.N. Doyle D.A. Vénien-Bryan C. Structure. 2005; 13: 1463-1472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), whereas a more recent report of multiple crystal structures of KirBac3.1 implies far more subtle rearrangements around the helix bundle crossing and favors a model in which the selectivity filter regulates channel conduction (18Clarke O.B. Caputo A.T. Hill A.P. Vandenberg J.I. Smith B.J. Gulbis J.M. Cell. 2010; 141: 1018-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). These disparate reports mirror earlier uncertainties arising from functional characterization of ligand-dependent “gated access” of cysteine-reactive probes. Specifically, several studies have reported no gating-dependent changes in accessibility of the Kir channel inner cavity (15Proks P. Antcliff J.F. Ashcroft F.M. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 70-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 17Xiao J. Zhen X.G. Yang J. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), whereas other reports have described the kinetic details for cysteine modification by methanethiosulfonate reagents and demonstrated that gated access can indeed be observed at sufficiently low channel Po (37Phillips L.R. Nichols C.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 122: 795-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 38Phillips L.R. Enkvetchakul D. Nichols C.G. Neuron. 2003; 37: 953-962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We cannot claim to have resolved these lingering uncertainties completely, although we would argue that the peculiar Kir6.2(F168E) phenotype sheds light on mechanisms of Kir channel gating and coupling to ligand-binding sites. We have demonstrated that it is possible to force channel opening with extrinsic stimuli that induce a conformational change around the helix bundle crossing. This finding does not provide direct evidence that the helix bundle crossing forms a functional gate in Kir6.2 but certainly indicates that conformational changes in this region can promote channel opening and are functionally coupled to the intrinsic ATP-binding site. Also, this induced gating motion likely resembles ATP-dependent conformational changes because forced channel opening changes the ATP sensitivity of the channel. Thus, conformational rearrangements of the bundle crossing are, at the very least, an important step in transducing ligand binding to the channel gate. Intriguingly, the presence of a hydrophilic glutamate at position 168 also prevented complete channel inhibition even at very high ATP concentrations. This resulted in a discrete plateau conductance with little fluctuation noise (Fig. 10), indicating a possible important role for hydrophobic residues for tight closure of the bundle crossing gate. An earlier study characterizing ATP inhibition in a variety of Kir6.2(F168X) mutants suggested the importance of large hydrophobic side chains in this position to achieve strong ATP sensitivity, although a plateau conductance was not explicitly reported (39Rojas A. Wu J. Wang R. Jiang C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1768: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Our findings differ from this report because the ATP sensitivity of Kir6.2(F168E) is only modestly altered relative to that of WT Kir6.2 (Fig. 9, B and D) unless alkaline pH is imposed. We emphasize that a rightward shift of ATP sensitivity (as reported in Ref. 39Rojas A. Wu J. Wang R. Jiang C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1768: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) does not necessarily indicate that channel closure is prevented, just that the closed state is destabilized relative to the open state. However, a plateau conductance (especially in the absence of any significant shift in ATP sensitivity) likely indicates that ATP-bound “closed” channels retain some permeability. Given the conservation of hydrophobic residues at the bundle crossing (Fig. 1B), it may be surprising that the presence of a hydrophilic glutamate is not more disruptive. For instance, single channel records from Kir6.2(F168E) exhibit well defined closures (as well as we are able to resolve) (Fig. 4), and macroscopic currents can be reduced considerably by ATP (Fig. 9) or internal acidification (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6, FIGURE 7, FIGURE 8, FIGURE 9, FIGURE 10). Together, these observations suggest that any conductance arising from “quasi-closed” F168E channels must be quite small and barely distinguishable from the closed state in single channel records. This study demonstrates a simple but novel mechanism to control channel gating rapidly and reversibly by introducing a protonatable side chain at a position that is important for channel opening and closing. A likely mechanism underlying this phenotype is pH-dependent mutual repulsion of glutamate side chains at F168E driving movement of the M2 helices and opening the channel pore. It should be noted that there are likely many factors influencing the engineered (non-native) pH-dependent gating. For example, despite carrying a similar carboxylic acid side chain, aspartate is not a suitable surrogate to observe the pH-dependent gating mechanism. No functional currents were detected from Kir6.2(F168D) channels, which could be due to poor tolerance of mutations in this functionally important region or possibly because aspartate undergoes a pKa shift that pushes the pH dependence beyond a practical range for patch clamp experiments. Additionally, other potentially interesting protonatable side chains (His and Lys) have not provided useful data, and this may be because the protonated state that would lead to channel opening by mutual repulsion would also carry a ring of positive charge around the mouth of the inner cavity. Prior experiments involving introduction of positive charges (by cysteine modification) in the bundle crossing region resulted in dramatic reduction of macroscopic conductance (40Kurata H.T. Marton L.J. Nichols C.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 2006; 127: 467-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 41Loussouarn G. Makhina E.N. Rose T. Nichols C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1137-1144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), likely by introducing a significant electrostatic barrier for ion permeation. In most Kir channels, one or more pore-lining residues in the narrow bundle crossing are occupied by large hydrophobic side chains, and this has been highlighted as potentially important for channel closure by the formation of a hydrophobic seal (14Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Antcliff J.F. Rahman T. Lowe E.D. Zimmer J. Cuthbertson J. Ashcroft F.M. Ezaki T. Doyle D.A. Science. 2003; 300: 1922-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar, 42Tao X. Avalos J.L. Chen J. MacKinnon R. Science. 2009; 326: 1668-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that this arrangement differs from other common models of gating (Kv channels and KcsA) where the bundle crossing comprises side chains with much smaller volumes (e.g. valines in Kv channels) (43Long S.B. Campbell E.B. MacKinnon R. Science. 2005; 309: 897-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1858) Google Scholar, 44Doyle D.A. Morais Cabral J. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5770) Google Scholar). In eukaryotic Kir channels strongly regulated by cytoplasmic ligand binding (i.e. KATP and GIRK pore-forming subunits), a phenylalanine is conserved in the final turn of the M2 helix (Fig. 1B). There appears to be less selective pressure for a bundle crossing aromatic in Kir channels that physiologically are predominantly open and regulated by polyamine block (Kir2 subfamily) or pH (Kir1 and Kir4 subfamilies). This dichotomy may reflect a stringent physiological requirement for tight channel closure in the ligand-gated subgroup, although we suspect that this may relate to the conservation of a gating mechanism that requires transduction from a cytoplasmic ligand-binding site. The role of aromatic side chains in the Kir channel bundle crossing will be clarified with further exploration of the ligand-dependent gating mechanisms of Kir channels. After acceptance of this article, a crystal structure of Kir2.2 in complex with PIP2 appeared in press (Structural basis of PIP2 activation of the classical inward rectifier K+ channel Kir2.2, epub August 28, doi 10:1038/nature10370), demonstrating conformational changes in the helix bundle crossing region that are likely associated with Kir channel opening.

The presented data supported the Gram-negative bacteria originating from an ancient endosymbiosis between the Actinobacteria and Clostridia. His conclusion was based on a presence-absence analysis of protein families that divided all prokaryotes into five groups: Actinobacteria, Double Membrane bacteria (DM), Clostridia, Archaea and Bacilli. Of these five groups, the DM are by far the largest and most diverse group compared to the other groupings. While the fusion hypothesis for the origin of double membrane bacteria is enticing, we show that the signal supporting an ancient symbiosis is lost when the DM group is broken down into smaller subgroups. We conclude that the signal detected in James Lake's analysis in part results from a systematic artifact due to group size and diversity combined with low levels of horizontal gene transfer."
