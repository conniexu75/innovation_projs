https://openalex.org/W2005988457,"Human T cell lymphoma leukemia virus (HTLV) is a human retrovirus (RNA tumor virus) that was originally isolated from a few patients with leukemias or lymphomas involving mature T lymphocytes. Here we report that the serum of Japanese patients with adult T cell leukemia, but not the serum of tested normal donors, contains high titers of antibodies to HTLV. These observations, together with data from Japan showing that adult T cell leukemia is endemic in southwest Japan, suggest that HTLV is involved in a subtype of human T cell malignancy, including Japanese adult T cell leukemia."
https://openalex.org/W1969791178,"We have prepared an antibody against chicken erythrocyte alpha spectrin, using as immunogen protein purified by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. One- and two-dimensional immunoautoradiography show that this antiserum reacts only with alpha spectrin in chicken erythrocytes and crossreacts with alpha spectrin in erythrocytes from various mammals. Immunofluorescence reveals that this antiserum reacts with a plasma membrane component in erythrocytes as well as in most nonerythroid avian and mammalian cells. Intense staining is seen at or near the plasma membrane in neurons, lens cells, endothelial and epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts, skeletal and cardiac muscle, as well as skeletal myotubes grown in tissue culture. Immunoautoradiography indicates that the crossreactive antigen in these nonerythroid tissues has the same molecular weight and isoelectric point as the chicken erythrocyte antigen. Smooth muscle, tracheal cilia, myelin and mature sperm stain weakly or not at all. These results suggest that spectrin is more extensively distributed than previously recognized, and that the functions of spectrin elucidated for erythrocytes may apply to other cell types as well."
https://openalex.org/W2029454495,"The chemotactic behavior of Escherichia coli has been studied by exposing cells tethered by a single flagellum to pulses of chemicals delivered iontophoretically. Normally, wild-type cells spin alternately clockwise and counterclockwise, changing their direction on the average approximately once per second. When cells were exposed to a very brief diffusive wave of attractant, the probability of spinning counterclockwise quickly peaked, then fell below the prestimulus value, returning to baseline within a few seconds; repellent responses were similar but inverted. The width of the response indicates that cells integrate sensory inputs over a period of seconds, while the biphasic character implies that they also take time derivatives of these inputs. The sensory system is maximally tuned to concentration changes that occur over a span of approximately 2 sec, an interval over which changes normally occur when cells swim in spatial gradients; it is optimized to extract information from signals subject to statistical fluctuation. Impulse responses of cells defective in methylation were similar to those of wild-type cells, but did not fall as far below the baseline, indicating a partial defect in adaptation. Impulse responses of cheZ mutants were aberrant, indicating a serious defect in excitation."

https://openalex.org/W1581484480,"The synthesis of the major linkage found in yeast cell wall structural polysaccharides, glucosyl-beta-(1 leads to 3)-glucosyl, was studied with a membrane preparation from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The sugar donor was UDP-glucose, and the reaction required addition of glycerol bovine serum albumin, and ATP or GTP for maximal activity. Under optimal conditions, extremely efficient glucose transfer was obtained, with 20 to 50% of the substrate utilized in 20 min at 30 degrees C. The polysaccharide formed in the reaction was insoluble in water and soluble in alkali; it was characterized enzymatically and chemically as a beta-(1 leads to 3)-linked linear glucan of chain length 60 to 80. The terminal reducing group was found to be labeled with 14C, as was the substrate used; therefore, the polysaccharide is synthesized de novo. For each glucosyl group transferred, one equivalent of UDP was formed. No evidence was found for a lipid-linked intermediate. When yeast protoplast lysates were subjected to fractionation by centrifugation in Renografin gradients, glucan synthetase was found in the plasma membrane fraction, with the same distribution and sidedness as chitin synthetase. Because of the spatially restricted growth of the cell wall during cell division in budding yeasts, this result suggests localized and reversible activation of the enzyme during the cell cycle."

https://openalex.org/W1838367913,"Abstract We have studied the mechanism by which metabolic energy is coupled to potassium accumulation by the fermentative bacterium, Streptococcus faecalis. In starving cells, K+ movements into the cells or out are very slow; even 42K+/K+ exchange requires concurrent metabolism of glucose or arginine. Metabolizing cells accumulate K+, establishing a concentration gradient of some 50,000. Accumulation is prevented by reagents that block or short circuit the proton circulation, but 42K+/K+ exchange persists. In glycolyzing cells whose proton pump has been blocked with N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, net uptake of K+ can be induced by imposing an artificial membrane potential, interior negative. Net K+ efflux is also controlled by the interplay of ATP and the proton circulation. Addition of proton conductors to glycolyzing cells induces K+ efflux, but has no effect on starving cells; the rate of K+ efflux appears to be a function of the cells' ATP content. We conclude that K+ accumulation requires the cells to generate both a protonmotive force and ATP. K+ uptake is electrogenic and attains a concentration gradient far too steep to be in equilibrium with the membrane potential. We consider two alternative models for K+ transport: a primary ATP-driven pump regulated by the proton circulation or a secondary porter activated by ATP that mediates symport of K+ with H+."

Although the specific effects of nuclear uptake and retention of androgen on the function of heart muscle cells are not known, the presence of this receptor suggests that sex steroid hormones may affect myocardial function directly and may explain some of the peculiar differences in heart disease between men and women."

https://openalex.org/W2046691210,"Several dysgenic traits may occur within the Drosophila melanogaster species as a result of crosses between different strains. Crossing two mutually interacting categories, named inducer and reactive, may lead, among other abnormalities, to a specific kind of female sterility that has proved useful for investigating the genetic factors involved in the interaction. The reactive state appears to result from a cytoplasmic state ultimately controlled by a chromosomal polygenic system. The inducer character is determined by a chromosomal factor that exhibits all characteristics of a transposable element. Overall, the data contribute to clarification of mutator activities in D. melanogaster and open new opportunities to investigate unusual genetic mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2075318985,"Termination of transcription at the end of the tryptophan (trp) operon of E. coli at the trp t site is very efficient in vivo, but is only 25% efficient in vitro. To try to resolve this discrepancy, we have altered numerous parameters and report here on the modifications that bring the in vitro results into closer agreement with the in vivo ones. Lowering the concentration of UTP (but not ATP, CTP or GTP) in the transcription mix can greatly improve termination at trp t. With three other terminators structurally similar to trp t, there is no detectable effect of reducing the concentration of any of the four triphosphates. This response at trp t to low UTP is therefore both nucleotide-specific and terminator-specific, suggesting that apparently minor structural differences may still have profound effects upon termination. Increased specificity and sensitivity may also be provided by the NusA protein, which causes RNA polymerase to pause at trp t and at the 1:2 stem of the trp attenuator. NusA protein also enhances termination at trp t, an effect similar to the low UTP response. Further, termination can be slightly improved by including rho factor, resulting in an overall efficiency of almost 100% at trp t."
https://openalex.org/W1603778778,"Cholera toxin-catalyzed ADP ribosylation of the membrane-bound GTP-binding protein that regulates adenylate cyclase activity requires certain components of the cytosol. In broken cells it is prevented by depletion of endogenous nucleotides and is restored by the provision of GTP (1 to 3 PM half-maximum) or ITP (30 PM) although not by ATP, CTP, TTP, or UTP. An hydrolysis-resistant GTP analog, guanyl-5’-yl imidodiphosphate (Gpp(NH)p, 1 to 3 p ~ ) , also supports the toxin-catalyzed reaction, but adenyl-5’-yl imidodiphosphate is only weakly effective. The ability of nucleoside triphosphates to support toxin-catalyzed ADP ribosylation or the toxin-catalyzed activation of adenylate cyclase correlate well. Even with excess GTP or Gpp(NH)p, the rate of ADP ribosylation and adenylate cyclase activation depends upon the presence of a macromolecular component of the erythrocyte cytosol. If GTP is employed, ADP ribosylation requires the simultaneous presence of this nucleotide, cytosolic macromolecules, NAD’, toxin, and membranes. However, membranes may be predisposed to respond to the toxin by preincubating them with Gpp(NH)p and cytosolic macromolecules. Preincubated membranes, washed free of unbound nucleotide, can then be ADP ribosylated by incubation with cholera toxin and NAD+ without additional cofactors. Both Gpp(NH)p and the macromolecular fraction of the cytosol are required for such preactivation. It is complete in 15 min at 37°C and is about three times slower at 25°C. It requires magnesium, is accelerated by isoproterenol, and is inhibited by GTP or sodium fluoride. The conditions for preactivation resemble those for the specific binding of Gpp(NH)p to the regulatory component of adenylate cyclase and consequent quasi-permanent activation of the cyclase, except that direct activation of the cyclase does not depend upon a cytosolic macromolecule. We conclude that the substrate for cholera toxin is a complex of the GTP-binding protein with GTP, in some way modified by a macromolecule of the cytosol."
https://openalex.org/W1570786435,"Several proteins in sarcoplasmic reticulum preparations move in a band with a mobility, in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels (0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.0), corresponding to a molecular mass of about 55,000 daltons. Only one of these proteins is the high affinity calcium binding protein. An intrinsic glycoprotein is also present in this band, and it is this glycoprotein which is found in vesicles reconstituted after dissolution of sarcoplasmic reticulum in deoxycholate. Both of these proteins are found in rather constant ratios with the ATPase in light, intermediate, and heavy sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles. Transverse tubular vesicles can be isolated from the heavy sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles after disruption of the membrane in a French pressure cell (Lau, Y.H., Caswell, A.H., and Brunschwig, J.P. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 5565-5574). These vesicles are enriched in their content of the high affinity calcium binding and depleted of the intrinsic glycoprotein. Cycloheptaamylose . fluorescamine complex (CFC) labels the intrinsic glycoprotein heavily indicating that it is at least partially exposed on the cytoplasmic surface of sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes. Since the carbohydrate component of the protein must lie in luminal spaces, it is inferred that the intrinsic glycoprotein is a transmembrane protein. The high affinity calcium binding protein is not labeled by CFC indicating that it is not exposed on the cytoplasmic surface of sarcotubular vesicles. The protein is also not affected by proteolytic digestion of sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles and can be isolated intact from trypsin-digested vesicles. It is not removed from sarcoplasmic-reticulum vesicles by washing with buffers containing Chelex 100 or ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA). These data show that the high affinity calcium binding protein is localized in the interior of the sarcotubular system and suggest that it might be common to both sarcoplasmic reticulum and transverse tubular membranes."

https://openalex.org/W1603509290,"The lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was isolated from three strains of Salmonella typhimurium, a smooth strain, STM 7, the Ra mutant, TV 119, and the Re mutant, SL 1102. The effect of depletion of divalent cations on structure and the effect of deoxycholate on hydrodynamic behavior were studied. The results confirmed previous work by others that divalent cations and hydrophobic forces are important factors influencing LPS size and morphology. The binding of deoxycholate to LPS was measured. When the weight average molecular weights of the deoxycholate-dissociated LPS were determined by sedimentation equilibrium and corrected for bound deoxycholate, the values 5,555, 10,607, and 15,592, respectively, for Re, Ra, and smooth LPS were in good agreement with calculated formula weights. Although others have suggested that the basic LPS subunit is a trimer, our results suggest that it exists in the dimeric form."
https://openalex.org/W1489792161,"Prostaglandin synthetase contains both oxygenase and peroxidase activity and catalyzes the first step of prostaglandin synthesis. Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) inhibits oxygenase activity by acetylating a serine residue of the enzyme. In the current study, we have investigated the subunit structure of this complex enzyme and the stoichiometry of aspirin-mediated acetylation of the enzyme. The enzyme was purified to near homogeneity in both active and aspirin-acetylated forms. The purified protein was analyzed for enzymatic activity, [3H]acetate content following treatment with [acetyl-3H]aspirin, NH2-terminal sequence, and amino acid composition. The results show first, that the enzyme can be purified to near homogeneity in an active form; second, that the enzyme consists of a single polypeptide chain (molecular weight 72,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) with a unique NH2-terminal sequence (Ala-Asp-Pro-Gly-Ala-Pro-Ala-Pro-Val-Asn-Pro-Met-Gly-); and third, that aspirin inhibits the enzyme by transfer of one acetate per enzyme monomer. Therefore, the two distinct enzymatic activities, oxygenation and peroxidation, are present in a single polypeptide chain. Experiments with a cross-linking agent indicate that in nonionic detergent the enzyme is a dimer of two identical subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1498380257,"Abstract We have purified propionyl-CoA carboxylase from normal, postmortem human liver to homogeneity. The isolation procedure, which provided an approximately 3000-fold purification and an overall yield of 26%, employed initial centrifugation of a cetyltrimethylammonium bromide-treated homogenate, followed by sequential chromatographic separations using DEAE-cellulose, Blue Sepharose, and Bio-Gel A-1.5m. The native enzyme has a molecular weight of approximately 540,000 and is composed of nonidentical subunits (alpha and beta) of Mr = 72,000 and 56,000, respectively. When studied with analytical isoelectrofocusing techniques, it focuses as a single peak at pH 5.5. Each mole of native enzyme contains 4 mol of bound biotin, virtually all of which is found with the larger (alpha) subunit. The apparent Km values for ATP, propionyl-CoA, and bicarbonate are 0.08 mM, 0.29 mM, and 3.0 mM, respectively. The enzyme also catalyzes the carboxylation of acetyl-CoA and butyryl-CoA to a limited degree, but not that of crotonyl-CoA. Propionyl-CoA carboxylase is quite stable over a temperature range from -50--37 degrees C and over a pH range from 6.2 to 8.4. It has a broad pH optimum from pH 7.2 to 8.8. Limited proteolysis with trypsin results in slow, time-dependent deactivation of the enzyme with preferential cleavage of the smaller subunit. Antiserum prepared against the native enzyme is shown to be monospecific by immunodiffusion and immunoelectrophoresis."
https://openalex.org/W1909465852,"The complete nucleotide sequence of the mRNA for the outer membrane lipoprotein from Escherichia coli has been determined. All the ribonuclease T1 and ribonuclease A fragments obtained from the mRNA were connected with DNA sequencing of restriction endonuclease fragments of the cloned lipoprotein gene. The mRNA consists of 322 nucleotides, and there are 38 and 50 nucleotides in the 5' and 3' end untranslated regions, respectively. The mRNA has several unique features: (a) Out of 50 possible codons for 15 amino acids in the prolipoprotein only 25 codons are used, and all of these appear to be read by the major isoaccepting species of tRNAs for individual amino acids. (b) In the first 64 nucleotides from the 5' end, there are no obvious secondary structures. On the other hand, between the 65th nucleotide and the 3' end, 85% of the nucleotides are involved in the formation of secondary structures, with nine stable stem-and-loop structures. (c) There are many repeating sequences including one repeat of 40 nucleotides. (d) There are a few other features which could be important for efficient translation of the mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1974712769,"Neurons in the visual cortex of monkeys and cats have been characterized as either (i) bar and edge detectors or (ii) cells selective for certain spatial frequencies. To assess which of these functional descriptions is more accurate, we measured (i) the selectivity and (ii) the responsivity-sensitivity of these neurons to bars of various widths and gratings of various spatial frequencies. All of the cells recorded from were considerably more selective along the dimension of spatial frequency than along the dimension of bar width. Further, most were more responsive and sensitive to the grating of optimal frequency than to the bar of optimal width."

https://openalex.org/W1742994929,"The mechanism of the inactivation of purified rat liver cytochrome P-450 during the metabolism of parathion has been investigated with special reference to the covalent binding to the enzyme of the atomic sulfur (S) released upon oxidation of the compound. In addition to the previously reported loss of cytochrome P-450 detectable as its carbon monoxide complex, a loss of heme detectable as pyridine-hemochromagen, and a loss of enzymatic activity toward benzphetamine and ethoxycoumarin are shown. The loss of heme is 80% of the loss of cytochrome P-450, which in turn is less than the loss of benzphetamine demethylase activity, the turnover number of the modified enzyme being two-thirds that of the native based on the amount of cytochrome P-450 detectable as its carbon monoxide complex. Treatment with performic acid or dithiothreitol removes 75% of the 35S covalently bound to the cytochrome P-450 during parathion metabolism. However, the dithiothreitol treatment does not restore cytochrome P-450 detectable as its carbon monoxide complex or enzymatic activity. Likewise, no protection against the loss of heme, cytochrome P-450, or enzymatic activity is afforded by inclusion of 1 mM dithiothreitol during the incubation with parathion, although the amount of irreversibly bound sulfur, i.e. sulfur not dissociable by dithiothreitol, is significantly reduced. In the absence of dithiothreitol, 4 nmol of 35S become bound to the cytochrome P-450 for each nanomole of P-450 no longer detectable as its carbon monoxide complex. Evidence is presented for the covalent binding of sulfur to at least three other amino acids than cysteine. It is suggested that structural changes resulting from the covalent binding of atomic sulfur to cysteine residues are responsible for at least some of the loss of enzymatic activity observed."
https://openalex.org/W2077414265,"We describe the generation of mammalian cell lines carrying amber suppressor genes. Nonsense mutants in the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV tk) gene, the Escherichia coli xanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (Eco-gpt) gene and the aminoglycoside 3′ phosphotransferase gene of the Tn5 transposon (NPT-II) were isolated and characterized. Each gene was engineered with the appropriate control signals to allow expression in both E. coli and mammalian cells. Expression in E. coli made possible the use of well developed bacterial and phage genetic manipulations to isolate and characterize the nonsense mutants. Once characterized, the nonsense mutants were transferred into mammalian cells by microinjection and used, in turn, to select for amber suppressor genes. Xenopus laevis amber suppressor genes, prepared by site-specific mutagenesis of a normal X. laevis tRNA gene, were microinjected into the above cell lines and selected for the expression of one or more of the amber mutant gene products. The resulting cell lines, containing functional amber suppressor genes, are stable and exhibit normal growth rates."
https://openalex.org/W1999378214,"We have developed an in vitro transcription system for yeast mitochondrial rRNA genes. Using highly purified yeast mitochondrial RNA polymerase and bacterial plasmids carrying DNA segments containing the mitochondrial rRNA sites of transcriptional initiation, we have been able to demonstrate correct initiation of transcription in vitro. By directly sequencing the transcription products, we show that transcription in vitro of both the 14S and 21 S rRNAs is initiated at precisely the same site as it is in vivo. Transcription of the rRNA genes is highly sensitive to ionic strength and RNA polymerase concentration. Additional factors or modified conditions may be necessary to permit accurate transcription of mitochondrial protein genes."
https://openalex.org/W1535783442,"A heretofore unrecognized form of cytochrome P-450 was purified from rabbit liver microsomes with an average yield and purity similar to that of other highly purified forms of cytochrome P-450. Several properties of this cytochrome are contrasted with those of form 2, the major phenobarbital-inducible cytochrome P-450, form 4, the major 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin-inducible cytochrome, and form 6, a cytochrome that is selectively induced in liver microsomes by 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin during the perinatal period. Thes four forms can be distinguished by virtue of their molecular weights as determined using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate, by their respective peptide fingerprints, and by the monospecificity of their antisera. Since the enumerated properties are thought to reflect the primary structure of the cytochromes and since the observed differences are extensive, we suggest that these four forms are not derived from a common protein precursor."
https://openalex.org/W1997257050,"We describe a monoclonal antibody (anti-FC-1) that inhibits the attachment of chicken embryo fibroblasts to artificial substrates. In the immunofluorescence, anti-FC-1 also stained the focal contacts of the fibroblasts, organelles suggested to be involved in cell-substrate adhesion. This antibody was absorbed on the surface of intact fibroblasts, and its action was blocked by cell extracts with nonionic detergents, indicating that the antigen (FC-1) is a surface membrane protein. Triton-extracted FC-1 exhibited a molecular weight of approximately 500,000, and a 60,000 dalton protein was immunoprecipitated from 35S-methionine-labeled cells. We have thus characterized a new protein at the exterior side of fibroblast's focal contacts. To determine to what degree this protein mediates the adhesion of the cells to the substrate, and whether it also interacts with the cytoskeletal elements on the cytoplasmic side, will require further investigation."

https://openalex.org/W2066142257,"Using an improved method to quantify the level of phosphorylation of the S6 ribosomal protein, we have analyzed the effect of growth stimuli on S6 phosphorylation in quiescent murine Swiss/3T3 cells to see if it can be dissociated from the later increase in DNA synthesis. Saturating concentrations of epidermal growth factor (EGF), insulin and serum each stimulate phosphorylation of the S6 ribosomal protein to the same maximal level; this is not so for DNA synthesis. Subsaturating concentrations of EGF and insulin act synergistically to stimulate both S6 phosphorylation and DNA synthesis, but qualitatively the two synergistic interactions are expressed differently. Insulin increases the maximal response of DNA synthesis to EGF, whereas it decreases the concentration of EGF required for half-maximal stimulation of S6 phosphorylation. We conclude that S6 phosphorylation is not a principal regulator of DNA synthesis, and that insulin and EGF regulate both S6 phosphorylation and DNA synthesis through different, but interacting, pathways of action."
https://openalex.org/W1491282693,"The beta-(p-aminophenyl)ethylamine derivatives of sialyloligosaccharides can be coupled to proteins via their phenylisothiocyanate intermediates under conditions that preserve labile sugar linkages. Bovine serum albumin containing 10 to 40 mol of oligosaccharides/mol of protein and keyhole limpet hemocyanin containing 1,100 mol of oligosaccharide/mol of protein have been prepared with the following oligosaccharides: Neu-NAc alpha 2-3Gal beta 1-4Glc, NeuNAc alpha 2-6Gal beta 1-4Glc, Neu-NAc alpha 2-6Gal beta 1-4GlcNAc beta 1-4Glc, Gal beta 1-3[Neu-NAc alpha 2-6]GlcNAc beta 1-4Glc, and NeuNAc alpha 2-3Gal- beta 1-3[NeuNAc alpha 2-6]GlcNAc beta 1-4Glc. Rabbits immunized with these synthetic glycoproteins produce antibodies directed against the oligosaccharides. The specificities of these antibodies are determined by comparing inhibitory activities of structurally related oligosaccharides in radioimmunoassay and by double diffusion analysis in agarose gels using oligosaccharide-protein conjugates as precipitating antigens. The antibodies distinguish positional isomers of sialic acid."

https://openalex.org/W2029895867,"Sensory transduction in E. coli consists of two phases, excitation and adaptation, both of which involve the methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs). These molecules relay transmembrane signals and are reversibly methylated during adaptation of E. coli to environmental stimuli. Each MCP contains multiple sites of methylation, and we identified six of these sites in MCPI. Recently, a second covalent modification of MCPs has been identified, which is not methylation. This modification, designated CheB-dependent modification, is stimulated by repellents and causes a net increase in the negative charge of MCPI and MCPII by one or two charges. We demonstrate that one CheB modification occurs on the methyl-accepting methionine-and lysine-containing tryptic peptide in MCPI and MCPII, and the second CheB modification is on an arginine-containing tryptic peptide. The CheB modification allows three additional methyl groups to be incorporated into the methyl-accepting methionine-lysine peptide, while not actually creating all of these methylation sites. The two CheB modifications occur sequentially. A possible mechanism by which CheB modification permits additional methylations and the role of CheB modification in bacterial chemotaxis are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1605205312,"The calcium-binding properties of the coagulation cofactor, Factor V, have been investigated using atomic absorption spectrophotometry, equilibrium dialysis, and chemical exchange experiments. Two classes of binding sites have been observed: one site containing a single Ca2+ ion bound with an unusually high affinity (Kd less than 10(-8) M), and a second site in which 2 mol of calcium are bound/mol of Factor V with an association constant Ka = 1.7 +/- 0.52 x 10(4) M-1 (Kd = 5.9 +/- 1.9 x 10(-5) M). The binding of the dissociable Ca2+ ions is apparently noncooperative. The single high affinity Ca2+ ion may be removed readily by EDTA under native conditions with an immediate loss of Factor V activity, and the activity of the Factor V can be restored by the addition of a molar excess of calcium. The high affinity Ca2+ ion will exchange with radiolabeled calcium in solution, and Factor V labeled in this way was used to provide an independent measure of the stoichiometry of this high affinity binding site, and to observe directly the interaction of calcium in this site with EDTA. In addition, elemental analyses of solid lyophilized samples of Factor V revealed that no transition metals are present and that no phosphorus (or phospholipid) is retained by the Factor V after purification."

https://openalex.org/W2149981278,"The yeast virus ScV is similar to other double-stranded RNA fungal viruses, which persist indefinitely without harm to their host cells. A single large viral double-stranded RNA (L) of 4.8 kilobase pairs codes for the major viral capsid polypeptide. Some strains have a second, satellite virus, with a genomic RNA (M) of 1.9 kilobase pairs, that codes for an extracellular toxin (killer toxin) responsible for killing sensitive cells. Sensitive cells lack a functional resistance gene on M. There are a number of different varieties of this satellite virus with different toxin and resistance specificities. Two of these, k1 and k2, are well characterized. A cytoplasmic genetic element causes the loss of the k2 virus. We show that this element is actually one of the k1 viruses; there are two k1 viruses with L genomic RNAs of the same size but different sequence, which account for some of the previously observed 3′-end heterogeneity of L."
https://openalex.org/W1946194953,"A sialyltransferase activity which catalyzes the synthesis of the trisialoganglioside GT1a from added disialoganglioside TD1a and CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid has been demonstrated using a particulate fraction of 9-day-old embryonic chick brains. The enzyme exhibited optimum activity with the detergent Triton CF-54 and showed a broad pH optimum of 6.0 to 7.2. Ca2+ inhibited the reaction, whereas Mn2+, Mg2+, and EDTA had no effect. Slight elevations in activity were seen in the presence of Hg2+ or histone. The apparent Km for GD1a leading to GT1a was estimated to be 10(-3) M. When the monosialoganglioside, GM1, was used as the glycolipid substrate under conditions optimum for the synthesis of GR1a from GD1a, approximately 65% of the radioactive label was found in GD1a. However, about 50% of the remaining radioactivity was found in GT1a. The results suggest that the synthesis of GR1a could proceed via the sequence GM1 yields GD1a yields GT1a."
https://openalex.org/W2992477311,"The sequence of 92 nucleotides at the 3' end of the mRNA which codes for the lipoprotein of the outer membrane of Escherichia coli has been determined to be GCUAACCAGCGUCUGGACAACAUGGCUACUAAAUACCGCAAGUAAUAGUACCUGUGAAGUGAAAAAUGGCGCACAUUGUGCGCCAUUUUUUUOH. This sequence includes the 50 nucleotides comprising the 3' untranslated region of the mRNA and contains codons for 14 amino acids at the COOH-terminal of the lipoprotein. In addition, the nucleotide sequences of all oligonucleotides derived from complete ribonuclease T1 and ribonuclease A digestions of the lipoprotein mRNA were established. These oligonucleotides were assigned to portions of the known amino acid sequence as well as the 5' untranslated and 3' untranslated regions of the mRNA molecule. With the use of the genetic code, these oligonucleotide sequences served to establish 94% of the mRNA sequence. The lipoprotein mRNA can be deduced to be 322 nucleotides in length. All three translation termination codons (UAA, UAG, and UGA) were found in phase with the coding region of the mRNA. The region at the 3' end of the mRNA showed unusual resistance to partial degradation, and the partial fragments from this region had anomalous mobilities in two-dimensional gels, even under denaturing conditions. This indicates that there is a very stable hairpin stem-and-loop structure at the 3' end. This hairpin structure exhibits all the structural elements implicated in termination of transcription in, prokaryotes."

https://openalex.org/W1546618552,"Membrane proteins within cell fractions of Tetrahymena have been separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the turnover of these proteins has been studied in nongrowing cells using double labeling procedures. Lactoperoxidase iodination and two-dimensional gel separations have revealed over 20 surface-labeled proteins, two of which are responsible for the single peak found in ciliary and nonciliary surface membranes. Turnover measurements show that there is heterogeneity in the rates at which membrane proteins turn over. The data suggest that larger proteins may turn over at higher rates in the microsomal fraction, as previously shown in mammalian cells. This was not found in the surface membrane fractions of Tetrahymena. However, membrane-associated cytoskeletal proteins had lower turnover rates than integral membrane proteins, and significant heterogeneity was found among the integral proteins measured. The implications of these findings for possible modes of membrane biogenesis in Tetrahymena are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1562069683,"A temperature-sensitive (t.s.) tRNATrp from Escherichia coli has a single base change from the wild type (w.t.) species, which results in the loss of a base pair at the bottom of the CCA stem of the cloverleaf structure. Thermodynamic studies on this t.s. tRNA show that it is more susceptible to denaturation than the w.t. due to a larger change in the entropy of denaturation. Correlated with this thermodynamic result is the finding that the denatured t.s. tRNA's T psi C loop is more susceptible to digestion by T1 RNase, suggesting that it has greater freedom than the corresponding structure on the denatured w.t. molecule. In contrast, the native form of the t.s. tRNATrp is very similar to the w.t. with regard to aminoacylation, T1 RNase susceptibility, and column chromatographic mobility, despite the fact that it necessarily has one less base pair. In addition, the well known denaturation-dependent shift in column chromatographic mobility, which is observed for both the t.s. and w.t. molecules, depends on a modification in the anticodon loop, since tRNATrp lacking that modification does not shift when denatured. Thus, though it is not usually thought to be implicated, denaturation probably affects the conformation of the anticodon loop. The lethal phenotype of the mutant at high temperature, defective attenuation of the tryptophan biosynthetic operon in the mutant, and some aspects of the denatured state are clarified by these findings."
