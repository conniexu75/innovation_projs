https://openalex.org/W2052130151,"Acetylation within the globular core domain of histone H3 on lysine 56 (H3K56) has recently been shown to have a critical role in packaging DNA into chromatin following DNA replication and repair in budding yeast. However, the function or occurrence of this specific histone mark has not been studied in multicellular eukaryotes, mainly because the Rtt109 enzyme that is known to mediate acetylation of H3K56 (H3K56ac) is fungal-specific. Here we demonstrate that the histone acetyl transferase CBP (also known as Nejire) in flies and CBP and p300 (Ep300) in humans acetylate H3K56, whereas Drosophila Sir2 and human SIRT1 and SIRT2 deacetylate H3K56ac. The histone chaperones ASF1A in humans and Asf1 in Drosophila are required for acetylation of H3K56 in vivo, whereas the histone chaperone CAF-1 (chromatin assembly factor 1) in humans and Caf1 in Drosophila are required for the incorporation of histones bearing this mark into chromatin. We show that, in response to DNA damage, histones bearing acetylated K56 are assembled into chromatin in Drosophila and human cells, forming foci that colocalize with sites of DNA repair. Furthermore, acetylation of H3K56 is increased in multiple types of cancer, correlating with increased levels of ASF1A in these tumours. Our identification of multiple proteins regulating the levels of H3K56 acetylation in metazoans will allow future studies of this critical and unique histone modification that couples chromatin assembly to DNA synthesis, cell proliferation and cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2017308570,"We used high-resolution SNP genotyping to identify regions of genomic gain and loss in the genomes of 212 medulloblastomas, malignant pediatric brain tumors. We found focal amplifications of 15 known oncogenes and focal deletions of 20 known tumor suppressor genes (TSG), most not previously implicated in medulloblastoma. Notably, we identified previously unknown amplifications and homozygous deletions, including recurrent, mutually exclusive, highly focal genetic events in genes targeting histone lysine methylation, particularly that of histone 3, lysine 9 (H3K9). Post-translational modification of histone proteins is critical for regulation of gene expression, can participate in determination of stem cell fates and has been implicated in carcinogenesis. Consistent with our genetic data, restoration of expression of genes controlling H3K9 methylation greatly diminishes proliferation of medulloblastoma in vitro. Copy number aberrations of genes with critical roles in writing, reading, removing and blocking the state of histone lysine methylation, particularly at H3K9, suggest that defective control of the histone code contributes to the pathogenesis of medulloblastoma."
https://openalex.org/W2040802571,"During perceptual decisions, the activity of sensory neurons correlates with a subject's percept, even when the physical stimulus is identical. The origin of this correlation is unknown. Current theory proposes a causal effect of noise in sensory neurons on perceptual decisions, but the correlation could result from different brain states associated with the perceptual choice (a top-down explanation). These two schemes have very different implications for the role of sensory neurons in forming decisions. Here we use white-noise analysis to measure tuning functions of V2 neurons associated with choice and simultaneously measure how the variation in the stimulus affects the subjects' (two macaques) perceptual decisions. In causal models, stronger effects of the stimulus upon decisions, mediated by sensory neurons, are associated with stronger choice-related activity. However, we find that over the time course of the trial these measures change in different directions-at odds with causal models. An analysis of the effect of reward size also supports this conclusion. Finally, we find that choice is associated with changes in neuronal gain that are incompatible with causal models. All three results are readily explained if choice is associated with changes in neuronal gain caused by top-down phenomena that closely resemble attention. We conclude that top-down processes contribute to choice-related activity. Thus, even forming simple sensory decisions involves complex interactions between cognitive processes and sensory neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1986447756,"Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and other primitive stem cells of mice have been known for more than 30 years to potently block retrovirus replication. Infection of ESCs by the murine leukaemia viruses (MLVs) results in the normal establishment of integrated proviral DNA, but this DNA is then transcriptionally silenced, preventing further viral spread. The repression is largely mediated by trans-acting factors that recognize a conserved sequence element termed the primer binding site, an 18-base pair sequence complementary to the 3' end of a cellular transfer RNA. A specific tRNA is annealed to the primer binding site sequence of the viral genomic RNA, and is used to prime DNA synthesis. This same sequence in the context of the integrated proviral DNA is targeted for silencing in ESCs. We have recently shown that a large protein complex binding to the primer binding site in ESCs contains TRIM28 (refs 8, 9), a well-characterized transcriptional co-repressor. An important question remains as to the identity of the factor that directly recognizes integrated retroviral DNAs and recruits TRIM28 to mediate their specific silencing. Here we identify the zinc finger protein ZFP809 as the recognition molecule that bridges the integrated proviral DNA and TRIM28. We show that expression of ZFP809 is sufficient to render even differentiated cells highly resistant to MLV infection. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ZFP809 is able to potently block transcription from DNA constructs of human T-cell lymphotropic virus-1 (HTLV-1), which use the same primer tRNA. These results identify ZFP809 as a DNA-binding factor that specifically recognizes a large subset of mammalian retroviruses and retroelements, targeting them for transcriptional silencing. We propose that ZFP809 evolved as a stem-cell-specific retroviral restriction factor, and therefore constitutes a new component of the intrinsic immune system of stem cells."

https://openalex.org/W2134573308,"Cochlear inner hair cells (IHCs) transmit acoustic information to spiral ganglion neurons through ribbon synapses. Here we have used morphological and physiological techniques to ask whether synaptic mechanisms differ along the tonotopic axis and within IHCs in the mouse cochlea. We show that the number of ribbon synapses per IHC peaks where the cochlea is most sensitive to sound. Exocytosis, measured as membrane capacitance changes, scaled with synapse number when comparing apical and midcochlear IHCs. Synapses were distributed in the subnuclear portion of IHCs. High-resolution imaging of IHC synapses provided insights into presynaptic Ca(2+) channel clusters and Ca(2+) signals, synaptic ribbons and postsynaptic glutamate receptor clusters and revealed subtle differences in their average properties along the tonotopic axis. However, we observed substantial variability for presynaptic Ca(2+) signals, even within individual IHCs, providing a candidate presynaptic mechanism for the divergent dynamics of spiral ganglion neuron spiking."

https://openalex.org/W2168312688,"Thomas Drake and colleagues report the results of knockout or transgene introduction for nine obesity candidate genes in mice. Eight of the nine mutations result in significant changes in obesity-related traits, validating their previously developed approach for identifying candidate genes involved in particular phenotypes. They further identify related metabolic pathways that are altered by manipulation of the eight genes. A principal task in dissecting the genetics of complex traits is to identify causal genes for disease phenotypes. We previously developed a method to infer causal relationships among genes through the integration of DNA variation, gene transcription and phenotypic information. Here we have validated our method through the characterization of transgenic and knockout mouse models of genes predicted to be causal for abdominal obesity. Perturbation of eight out of the nine genes, with Gas7, Me1 and Gpx3 being newly confirmed, resulted in significant changes in obesity-related traits. Liver expression signatures revealed alterations in common metabolic pathways and networks contributing to abdominal obesity and overlapped with a macrophage-enriched metabolic network module that is highly associated with metabolic traits in mice and humans. Integration of gene expression in the design and analysis of traditional F2 intercross studies allows high-confidence prediction of causal genes and identification of pathways and networks involved."

https://openalex.org/W2073452121,"Deregulated Skp2 function promotes cell transformation, and this is consistent with observations of Skp2 overexpression in many human cancers. However, the mechanisms underlying elevated Skp2 expression are still unknown. Here we show that the serine/threonine protein kinase Akt1, but not Akt2, directly controls Skp2 stability by a mechanism that involves degradation by the APC-Cdh1 ubiquitin ligase complex. We show further that Akt1 phosphorylates Skp2 at Ser 72, which is required to disrupt the interaction between Cdh1 and Skp2. In addition, we show that Ser 72 is localized within a putative nuclear localization sequence and that phosphorylation of Ser 72 by Akt leads to cytoplasmic translocation of Skp2. This finding expands our knowledge of how specific signalling kinase cascades influence proteolysis governed by APC-Cdh1 complexes, and provides evidence that elevated Akt activity and cytoplasmic Skp2 expression may be causative for cancer progression."
https://openalex.org/W1986375034,"Skp2 is an F-box protein that forms the SCF complex with Skp1 and Cullin-1 to constitute an E3 ligase for ubiquitylation. Ubiquitylation and degradation of the p27 are critical for Skp2-mediated entry to the cell cycle, and overexpression and cytosolic accumulation of Skp2 have been clearly associated with tumorigenesis, although the functional significance of the latter is still unknown. Here we show that Akt/protein kinase B (PKB) interacts with and directly phosphorylates Skp2. We find that Skp2 phosphorylation by Akt triggers SCF complex formation and E3 ligase activity. A phosphorylation-defective Skp2 mutant is drastically impaired in its ability to promote cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. Furthermore, we show that Akt-mediated phosphorylation triggers 14-3-3beta-dependent Skp2 relocalization to the cytosol, and we attribute a specific role to cytosolic Skp2 in the positive regulation of cell migration. Finally, we demonstrate that high levels of activation of Akt correlate with the cytosolic accumulation of Skp2 in human cancer specimens. Our results therefore define a novel proto-oncogenic Akt/PKB-dependent signalling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2042048838,"Cardiac myosin-binding protein C (cMyBP-C) is a regulatory protein expressed in cardiac sarcomeres that is known to interact with myosin, titin, and actin. cMyBP-C modulates actomyosin interactions in a phosphorylation-dependent way, but it is unclear whether interactions with myosin, titin, or actin are required for these effects. Here we show using cosedimentation binding assays, that the 4 N-terminal domains of murine cMyBP-C (i.e. C0-C1-m-C2) bind to F-actin with a dissociation constant (K(d)) of approximately 10 microm and a molar binding ratio (B(max)) near 1.0, indicating 1:1 (mol/mol) binding to actin. Electron microscopy and light scattering analyses show that these domains cross-link F-actin filaments, implying multiple sites of interaction with actin. Phosphorylation of the MyBP-C regulatory motif, or m-domain, reduced binding to actin (reduced B(max)) and eliminated actin cross-linking. These results suggest that the N terminus of cMyBP-C interacts with F-actin through multiple distinct binding sites and that binding at one or more sites is reduced by phosphorylation. Reversible interactions with actin could contribute to effects of cMyBP-C to increase cross-bridge cycling."

https://openalex.org/W2097353783,"Active somatosensory perception requires the integration of signals arising from both external stimuli and motor activity. The authors found a population of neurons in rat somatosensory cortex that responded to touch only when contact occurred at a specific phase in the whisk cycle, providing information about the position of the object relative to the rat's face. Sensory perception involves the dual challenge of encoding external stimuli and managing the influence of changes in body position that alter the sensory field. To examine mechanisms used to integrate sensory signals elicited by both external stimuli and motor activity, we recorded from rats trained to rhythmically sweep their vibrissa in search of a target. We found a select population of neurons in primary somatosensory cortex that are transiently excited by the confluence of touch by a single vibrissa and the phase of vibrissa motion in the whisk cycle; different units have different preferred phases. This conditional response enables the rodent to estimate object position in a coordinate frame that is normalized to the trajectory of the motor output, as defined by phase in the whisk cycle, rather than angle of the vibrissa relative to the face. The underlying computation is consistent with gating by an inhibitory shunt."
https://openalex.org/W2060065181,"5'-Methylthioadenosine/S-adenosylhomocysteine nucleosidase (MTAN) is a bacterial enzyme involved in S-adenosylmethionine-related quorum sensing pathways that induce bacterial pathogenesis factors. Transition state analogs MT-DADMe-Immucillin-A, EtT-DADMe-Immucillin-A and BuT-DADMe-Immucillin-A are slow-onset, tight-binding inhibitors of Vibrio cholerae MTAN (VcMTAN), with equilibrium dissociation constants of 73, 70 and 208 pM, respectively. Structural analysis of VcMTAN with BuT-DADMe-Immucillin-A revealed interactions contributing to the high affinity. We found that in V. cholerae cells, these compounds are potent MTAN inhibitors with IC(50) values of 27, 31 and 6 nM for MT-, EtT- and BuT-DADMe-Immucillin-A, respectively; the compounds disrupt autoinducer production in a dose-dependent manner without affecting growth. MT- and BuT-DADMe-Immucillin-A also inhibited autoinducer-2 production in enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 with IC(50) values of 600 and 125 nM, respectively. BuT-DADMe-Immucillin-A inhibition of autoinducer-2 production in both strains persisted for several generations and caused reduction in biofilm formation. These results support MTAN's role in quorum sensing and its potential as a target for bacterial anti-infective drug design."
https://openalex.org/W2048489053,"Accumulating data point to K(+) channels as relevant players in controlling cell cycle progression and proliferation of human cancer cells, including prostate cancer (PCa) cells. However, the mechanism(s) by which K(+) channels control PCa cell proliferation remain illusive. In this study, using the techniques of molecular biology, biochemistry, electrophysiology and calcium imaging, we studied the expression and functionality of intermediate-conductance calcium-activated potassium channels (IK(Ca1)) in human PCa as well as their involvement in cell proliferation. We showed that IK(Ca1) mRNA and protein were preferentially expressed in human PCa tissues, and inhibition of the IK(Ca1) potassium channel suppressed PCa cell proliferation. The activation of IK(Ca1) hyperpolarizes membrane potential and, by promoting the driving force for calcium, induces calcium entry through TRPV6, a cation channel of the TRP (Transient Receptor Potential) family. Thus, the overexpression of the IK(Ca1) channel is likely to promote carcinogenesis in human prostate tissue."
https://openalex.org/W1971422405,"Timothy Graubert and colleagues report a high-resolution survey of copy number variation in mouse inbred strains and assess the impact of such variation on gene expression. They find that up to 26% of strain-dependent expression variation in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells is associated with copy number variation. The extent to which differences in germline DNA copy number contribute to natural phenotypic variation is unknown. We analyzed the copy number content of the mouse genome to sub–10-kb resolution. We identified over 1,300 copy number variant regions (CNVRs), most of which are <10 kb in length, are found in more than one strain, and, in total, span 3.2% (85 Mb) of the genome. To assess the potential functional impact of copy number variation, we mapped expression profiles of purified hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, adipose tissue and hypothalamus to CNVRs in cis. Of the more than 600 significant associations between CNVRs and expression profiles, most map to CNVRs outside of the transcribed regions of genes. In hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, up to 28% of strain-dependent expression variation is associated with copy number variation, supporting the role of germline CNVs as key contributors to natural phenotypic variation in the laboratory mouse."
https://openalex.org/W2075357023,"Angiopoietin-like protein 4 (ANGPTL4) is a secreted protein that modulates the disposition of circulating triglycerides (TG) by inhibiting lipoprotein lipase (LPL). Here we examine the steps involved in the synthesis and post-translational processing of ANGPTL4, and the effects of a naturally occurring sequence variant (E40K) that is associated with lower plasma TG levels in humans. Expression of the wild-type and mutant proteins in HEK-293A cells indicated that ANGPTL4 formed dimers and tetramers in cells prior to secretion and cleavage of the protein. After cleavage at a canonical proprotein convertase cleavage site (161RRKR164), the oligomeric structure of the N-terminal domain was retained whereas the C-terminal fibrinogen-like domain dissociated into monomers. Inhibition of cleavage did not interfere with oligomerization of ANGPTL4 or with its ability to inhibit LPL, whereas mutations that prevented oligomerization severely compromised the capacity of the protein to inhibit LPL. ANGPTL4 containing the E40K substitution was synthesized and processed normally, but no monomers or oligomers of the N-terminal fragments accumulated in the medium; medium from these cells failed to inhibit LPL activity. Parallel experiments performed in mice recapitulated these results. Our findings indicate that oligomerization, but not cleavage, of ANGPTL4 is required for LPL inhibition, and that the E40K substitution destabilizes the protein after secretion, preventing the extracellular accumulation of oligomers and abolishing the ability of the protein to inhibit LPL activity.

Chickering T.W. Rosen E.D. Dussault B. Qin Y. Soukas A. Friedman J.M. Holmes W.E. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 5343-5349Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 2Kersten S.

Triglycerides, either acquired from the diet or synthesized endogenously, circulate in blood as constituents of chylomicrons and very low density lipoproteins (VLDL). As these lipoproteins circulate in tissues they encounter lipoprotein lipase (LPL) at the vascular endothelial surfaces. LPL hydrolyzes the TG, producing free fatty acids that are taken up by the surrounding tissues. ANGPTL4 inhibits the activity of LPL, thereby limiting the uptake of TG-derived fatty acids by the underlying cells (3Yoshida K. Shimizugawa T. Ono M. Furukawa H. J.

Overexpression of ANGPTL4 in mice causes severe hypertriglyceridemia, whereas mice lacking ANGPTL4 have increased LPL activity and low plasma levels of TG (5Koster A. Chao Y.B. Mosior M. Ford A. Gonzalez-DeWhitt P.A. Hale J.E. Li D. Qiu Y. Fraser C.C. Yang D.D. Heuer J.G. Jaskunas S.R. Eacho P. Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 4943-4950Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 6Lichtenstein L.

Accordingly it has been proposed that ANGPTL4 inhibits LPL activity in adipose tissue to reroute fatty acids away from fat to muscle and other tissues when food intake is low (3Yoshida K. Shimizugawa T. Ono M. Furukawa H. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 1770-1772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 4Oike Y. Akao M. Kubota Y. Suda T. Trends Mol.

ANGPTL4 belongs to a family of seven structurally similar secreted proteins (ANGPTL1-ANGPTL7) that contain a signal sequence followed by an α-helical region predicted to form a coiled-coil, and a globular fibrinogen-like domain at the C terminus (1Yoon J.C. Chickering T.W. Rosen E.D. Dussault B. Qin Y. Soukas A. Friedman J.M. Holmes W.E. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 5343-5349Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Gel filtration studies of recombinant ANGPTL4 indicate that the protein assembles into oligomers that are stabilized by disulfide bonds (7Ge H. Yang G. Yu X. Pourbahrami T. Li C. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 2071-2079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Substitution of two highly conserved cysteine residues at positions 76 and 80 in the α-helical domain prevents oligomerization of ANGPTL4 and impairs the ability of the recombinant protein to increase plasma TG levels when overexpressed in the livers of rats (7Ge H. Yang G. Yu X. Pourbahrami T. Li C. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 2071-2079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Upon secretion into the circulation, ANGPTL4 is cleaved into an N-terminal domain and a C-terminal fibrinogen-like domain (8Ge H. Yang G. Huang L. Motola D.L. Pourbahrami T. Li C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2038-2045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The N-terminal peptide circulates as an oligomer, and the fibrinogen-like domain circulates as a monomer (8Ge H. Yang G. Huang L. Motola D.L. Pourbahrami T. Li C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2038-2045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The N-terminal helical region of ANGPTL4 is necessary and sufficient for inhibition of LPL (9Ge H. Cha J.Y. Gopal H. Harp C. Yu X. Repa J.J. Li C. J. Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 1484-1490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). A peptide corresponding to amino acids 1-187 of the protein binds LPL with high affinity and converts the enzyme from catalytically active dimers to inactive monomers, thereby inhibiting LPL activity (10Sukonina V. Lookene A. Olivecrona T. Olivecrona G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 17450-17455Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). After disrupting the LPL dimer, ANGPTL4 is released. The LPL monomers remain folded and stable but fail to re-form active dimers. These data suggest that the N-terminal domain of ANGPTL4 interacts directly but transiently with LPL, triggering a stable conformational switch in LPL that irreversibly inactivates the enzyme. Recently, we used a population-based resequencing strategy to examine the metabolic role of ANGPTL4 in humans (11Romeo S. Pennacchio L.A. Fu Y. Boerwinkle E. Tybjaerg-Hansen A. Hobbs H.H. Cohen J.C. Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: 513-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Resequencing the coding region of ANGPTL4 in a large (n = 3,501), multiethnic sample revealed multiple rare sequence variations that alter an amino acid in the protein and are associated with low plasma TG levels. In addition, we identified a more common variant (E40K), that was present in ∼3% of European-Americans and was associated with significantly lower plasma levels of TG and low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), and higher levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL)-C in two large epidemiological studies (11Romeo S.

These association studies confirmed that ANGPTL4 is involved in TG metabolism in humans, and also revealed additional roles in humans in the metabolism of HDL and LDL, which were not apparent from studies in genetically modified mice. Here we examined the synthesis, secretion, and processing of ANGPTL4 and determine the mechanism by which substitution of a basic (lysine) for an acidic (glutamate) residue at residue 40 affects the function of the protein. Materials—Culture medium and fetal bovine serum were obtained from Meditech, Inc. (Herndon, VA). Protease inhibitor mixture tablets were purchased from Roche Applied Science. 9,10-[3H](N)Triolein was purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO). Polyclonal antibodies were raised by immunizing rabbits using N-terminal (amino acids 26-154) and C-terminal (amino acids 170-406) fragments of human ANGPTL4. Rabbit anti-human ANGPTL4 polyclonal antibody was purchased from Biovendor (Modrice, Czech Republic). Mouse anti-V5 monoclonal antibody was purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Rabbit anti-human calnexin polyclonal antibody was purchase from Stressgen (Ann Arbor, MI). All other chemicals and reagents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise indicated. Animal Treatment—Male C57BL/6J mice (The Jackson Laboratory) aged 8-10 weeks were used for this study. Mice were group-housed (four mice per cage) and fed standard rodent chow. All procedures were performed according to the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. Animals (n = 5 per group) were injected with recombinant adenovirus (1.25 × 1011 particles/mouse) in saline solution via the tail vein. After 72 h, animals were anesthetized, blood samples were drawn, and heparin (1 unit/g body weight) was injected via the jugular vein. A second blood sample was collected 10 min after heparin administration and the animals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Livers were removed and snap-frozen. Expression of ANGPTL4 in Cultured Cells—The human ANGPTL4 cDNA with a V5 epitope tag (GKPIPNPLLGLDST) at the C terminus was inserted into pcDNA3.1 under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter-enhancer (pCMV-ANGPTL4-V5). Sequence changes were introduced into the construct using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The sequences of the oligonucleotides used for mutagenesis are available on request. The presence of the desired mutation and the fidelity of each construct were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Transfections, Cell Lysates, and Liver Lysates—Human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293A cells were seeded (1 × 105 cells/well) in 6-well plates and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum (Cellgro). Cells were transiently transfected with expression plasmids (4 μg/well) using Lipofectamine 2000 (2.5 μl of Lipofectamine 2000/μg of DNA) according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). After 48 h, medium was collected and centrifuged for 5 min (5,000 × g at 4 °C) to remove cell debris. Cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4) and then lysed in 0.3 ml of 1× radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (RIPA) (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% (v/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and complete mini EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche)) at 4 °C. Cells were harvested by scraping with a rubber policeman and transferred to 1.5-ml tubes prior to centrifugation for 15 min (15,000 × g at 4 °C). Aliquots from medium and cells were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis. Mouse livers were homogenized with a IKA T10 Ultra-Turrax hand homogenizer (Wilmington, NC), in 1× RIPA buffer and centrifuged at 15,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min. Supernatants were collected, and aliquots (50 μg) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis. SDS-PAGE and Immunoblot Analysis—Protein concentrations in the cell lysates were determined using the Bio-Rad bicinchoninic acid assay, according to the manufacturer's protocol. Equivalent amounts of protein from the cell lysate and medium were added to sample loading buffer (final concentration of 1×) with, or without β-mercaptoethanol (β-ME). The samples were heated to 95 °C for 5 min, loaded onto 4-15% gradient (for non-reduced samples) or 15% (for reduced samples) SDS-polyacrylamide gels, size-fractionated at 125 V, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were incubated in PBST buffer (1× PBS, pH 7.4, and 0.1% Tween 20) with 5% dry milk for 60 min at room temperature before addition of the primary antibodies. Primary antibodies were diluted in PBST buffer with 5% dry milk and incubated with membranes for 60 min. Membranes were washed three times for 10 min in PBST buffer. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG or goat anti-mouse IgG (Pierce) was diluted (1:10,000) in PBST buffer with 5% dry milk and incubated with membranes for 60 min. Membranes were washed three times for 10 min in PBST and visualized using SuperSignal-enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). In Vitro Assay of Lipoprotein Lipase—LPL activity was measured using a modification of the procedure described by Nilsson-Ehle and Schotz (12Nilsson-Ehle P. Schotz M.C. J. Lipid Res. 1976; 17: 536-541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LPL activity in adenovirus-injected mouse plasma was determined by incubating 7.5 μl of post-heparin plasma with radiolabeled substrate composed of 9,10-[3H](N)triolein (American Radiolabeled Chemicals), triolein, and phosphatidylcholine (Sigma). To determine the effect of ANGPTL4 on LPL activity, conditioned medium harvested from HEK-293A cells transfected with ANGPTL4 expression constructs was concentrated 8-fold and buffer-exchanged into 1× PBS, pH 7.4, using Amicon concentrators. The medium was then preincubated with 7.5 μl of mouse post-heparin plasma at 20 °C for 30 min before addition of radiolabeled substrate. LPL assays were performed at 37 °C and terminated after 15 min by adding heptane-chloroform-methanol (1:1.25:1.41) and then centrifuging at 3,000 × g for 15 min. A 1-ml aliquot of upper (aqueous) phase were taken into scintillation tubes and counted. The amount of 3H-fatty acid released was calculated as previously described (12Nilsson-Ehle P. Schotz M.C. J.

Homologs that were identified were clustered, and representative sequences containing the N-terminal domain similar to ANGPTL4 were multiple-aligned using the PROMALS3D program (15Pei J. Kim B.H. Grishin N.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 2295-2300Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). Expression and Secretion of Recombinant ANGPTL4-E40K in HEK-293A Cells—To determine the effects of the E40K substitution on expression and secretion of ANGPTL4, we performed a time course experiment in HEK-293A cells that were transfected with constructs expressing wild-type and mutant forms of the protein. Immunoblot analyses were performed using antibodies specific for the C-terminal and N-terminal fragments (Fig. 1). Wild-type ANGPTL4 was expressed as a ∼50-kDa protein, and a band of similar size was present in the medium (Fig. 1, top); this band was detected using both the C-terminal and N-terminal antibody and represents the full-length, uncleaved protein. ANGPTL4 contains a highly conserved tetrapeptide sequence (161RRKR164) that matches the preferred cleavage site [RX(K/R)R] for furin, a proprotein convertase that cleaves a broad range of proteins in the secretory pathway and on the cell surface (16Thomas G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 753-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). Cleavage of the protein between arginine residues 161 and 162 would be expected to generate a C-terminal fragment of 37 kDa and an N-terminal fragment of 15 kDa. Bands of the expected sizes were present in the medium and increased progressively in relative intensity over the 2-h time course of the experiment. These data are consistent with ANGPTL4 being synthesized in cells as a full-length protein, and then undergoing cleavage into a 15-kDa N-terminal and a 37-kDa C-terminal fragment. Because neither of the cleavage fragments were detected in the cells, ANGPTL4 cleavage must occur late in the secretory pathway, on the cell surface, or in the medium. Cleavage did not require addition of serum to the medium. The E40K isoform was expressed at comparable levels to the wild-type protein in the cells, but immunoblot analysis with the C-terminal antibody revealed only the 37-kDa C-terminal fragment in the medium (Fig. 1, lower panel). None of the full-length form of the E40K isoform was detected in the medium when the proteins were immunoblotted with the C-terminal antibody. The rate of accumulation of the C-terminal fragment in the medium over the 2-h time course of the experiment was similar to that seen in cells expressing the wild-type protein. Small amounts of full-length E40K protein were visible in medium immunoblotted with the N-terminal antibody, which appears to bind with higher affinity to full-length ANGPTL4 than does the C-terminal antibody. No N-terminal fragment was detected in the medium of cells expressing ANGPTL4-E40K. From this experiment, we concluded that the E40K mutation did not interfere with synthesis, secretion, or cleavage of ANGPTL4. The reduced amount of full-length ANGPTL4 and absence of any detectable N-terminal fragment in the medium is consistent with the substitution promoting degradation of both the full-length protein and the N-terminal domain fragments. The E40K Mutation Prevents Accumulation of ANGPTL4 Oligomers in the Medium—Residue 40 of ANGPTL4 is highly conserved through vertebrate evolution. The corresponding residue is a glutamate in all mammals for which the sequence is available and aspartic acid in fish (Table 1). A closely related family member, ANGPTL3, also has either glutamate or aspartate at this position. Glu-40 is predicted to reside in the 1st turn of an α-helix (FASWDEMNVLAHGLLQLG). This helix is followed by another helix that is predicted to be oriented at an angle to the first helix.TABLE 1Sequence alignment of conserved N-terminal motif in ANGPTLRepresentatives of two subfamilies (ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4) with a conserved acidic residue at positions 40 (ANGPTL4 human number, highlighted red) are shown. Positions with semiinvariant and uncharged residues are highlighted black and yellow, respectively. NCBI gi numbers are shown on the right, consensus computed on the PROMALS3D alignment of all sequences is shown below. Representatives of two subfamilies (ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4) with a conserved acidic residue at positions 40 (ANGPTL4 human number, highlighted red) are shown. Positions with semiinvariant and uncharged residues are highlighted black and yellow, respectively. NCBI gi numbers are shown on the right, consensus computed on the PROMALS3D alignment of all sequences is shown below. The N-terminal domain of ANGPTL4 was shown previously to form higher order oligomers that are stabilized by disulfide bonds (7Ge H. Yang G. Yu X. Pourbahrami T. Li C. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 2071-2079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The domain contains two cysteine residues (Cys-76 and Cys-80) (Fig. 1, top) that when mutated markedly reduce the inhibitory effect of ANGPTL4 on LPL activity (7Ge H. Yang G. Yu X. Pourbahrami T. Li C. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 2071-2079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of the E40K substitution on the oligomerization of ANGPTL4, we used both non-reducing (NR) and reducing (R) gels to fractionate the lysates from cells transfected with wild-type ANGPTL4 or ANGPTL4-E40K (Fig. 2). We included in the experiment cells expressing ANGPTL4 containing a neutral residue (alanine) or another acidic residue (aspartate) for glutamate to further define the role of residue 40 on the oligomerization of ANGPTL4. Immunoblot analysis of non-reduced gels using antibodies to the C terminus or N terminus of ANGPTL4 revealed bands at 50, 100, and 200 kDa in lysates from cells transfected with all four constructs (lanes 1-4 and 9-12). These bands are the expected size of monomers (F1), dimers (F2), and tetramers (F4) of the full-length protein. Because ANGPTL4-E40A and -E40D oligomerized in a manner similar to the wild-type protein (lanes 3, 4, 11, and 12), the glutamic acid at residue 40 is not required for the formation of the higher order oligomers of ANGPTL4 in cells. Immunoblot analysis of ANGPTL4 in the medium of the cells under both nonreduced and reduced conditions is shown in the right panel of Fig. 2. When the C-terminal antibody was used for immunoblotting, only the 37-kDa fragment, corresponding to the cleaved C terminus (C1), was present in the medium (a band corresponding to the full-length protein was only apparent on very long exposures (data not shown)). Similar amounts of the C-terminal fragment were present in medium from cells expressing wild-type (lane 5) and mutant forms of ANGPTL4 (lanes 6-8). Thus, the absence of a glutamic acid residue at position 40 in ANGPTL4 did not interfere with the synthesis, oligomerization, secretion, or cleavage of ANGPTL4. When duplicate aliquots of the medium were subjected to immunoblotting with the N-terminal antibody under nonreduced conditions, significant differences were apparent between the wild-type and mutant forms of the protein. A 15-kDa band and a series of bands of higher molecular weight that were multiples of 15 kDa were present in the medium from cells expressing wild-type ANGPTL4 (lane 13). These bands correspond to monomers (N1), dimers (N2) and tetramers (N4) of the 15-kDa N-terminal fragment. Bands of the expected size of the full-length protein and of oligomers of the intact protein were also detected with the N-terminal antibody (F1, F2, and F4). These full-length oligomers were visible when the C-terminal antibody was used for immunoblotting only after a prolonged exposure of the film to the immunoblot (data not shown). In addition to oligomers of the N-terminal and full-length protein, fragments with an estimated molecular mass of 65 and 134 kDa were also present in the medium of cells expressing the wild-type protein. These bands presumably represent additional oligomers of the N terminus or of the N terminus bound to the full-length protein (see below). These data indicate that the N-terminal domains of wild-type ANGPTL4 remain oligomerized after cleavage, whereas the C-terminal domains dissociate into monomers. In contrast to these results, no immunodetectable N-terminal fragment or higher molecular weight oligomers were present in the medium of cells expressing ANGPTL4-E40K (lane 14) or ANGPTL4-E40A (lane 15). Substitution of aspartate for glutamic acid at residue 40 produced a banding pattern that was similar to the wild-type protein (lane 16). Thus, substitution of a positively charged or neutral residue for a negatively charged amino acid at position 40 does not interfere with the oligomerization, secretion, or catalytic cleavage of ANGPTL4, but rather with stabilization of oligomers of the full-length protein, and of the N-terminal fragments. These data suggest that a negatively charged amino acid at residue 40 is required to stabilize higher order oligomers of ANGPTL4 after cleavage. The E40K Substitution Affects ANGPTL4 Oligomers Independently of Cleavage—Next we examined the effect of protein cleavage on the stability of the N-terminal domain. Substitution of the residues at the highly conserved furin cleavage site (161RRKR164) with the sequence GSGS abolished cleavage of the protein (Fig. 3, lane 7). Because cleavage proceeded normally in furin-deficient cells, a protein other than furin must also be capable of cleaving ANGPTL4 (supplemental Fig. S1). To determine the effect of the E40K substitution in a protein that could not be cleaved, we introduced the substitution into the ANGPTL4-GSGS construct (EKGS). In cells, oligomer formation by ANGPTL4 containing the GSGS sequence (±E40K) (lanes 3, 4, 11, and 12) was indistinguishable from that of wild-type ANGPTL4, and the mutant proteins were secreted into medium (lanes 7, 8, 15, and 16). As expected, full-length ANGPTL4 (F1) but no C-terminal fragment (C1), was present in the medium of cells expressing ANGPTL4-GSGS (lane 7) and ANGPTL4-EKGS (lane 8). A band with an estimated molecular mass of 200 kDa, the predicted size of the full-length tetramer (F4), was present in the medium of the GSGS cells (lane 7), and a band at the expected size of the dimer (F2) was seen when the N-terminal antibody was used (lane 15). No full-length dimers or tetramers were present in medium from cells expressing ANGPL4-EKGS. Only the full-length monomer of ANGPTL4-EKGS was present in the medium (lanes 8 and 16). These results are consistent with the RRKR being the site of cleavage of ANGPTL4 and demonstrate that cleavage is not required for formation or secretion of ANGPTL4 oligomers. Moreover, the absence of any oligomers in the medium from the cells expressing ANGPTL4-EKGS demonstrates that substitution of lysine for glutamate at position 40 interferes with maintenance of stable oligomers of ANGPTL4, irrespective of whether or not the protein undergoes catalytic cleavage. The Cysteine Residues in the N Terminus Are Required for N-terminal Oligomerization of ANGPTL4—The N-terminal domain of ANGPTL4 contains two cysteine residues (Cys-76 and Cys-80) that when mutated markedly reduce the inhibitory effect of ANGPTL4 on LPL activity (7Ge H. Yang G. Yu X. Pourbahrami T. Li C. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 2071-2079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We mutated each of the cysteines to alanine individually (C76A, C80A) and together (CCAA) to determine the effects on oligomerization (Fig. 4). Full-length monomer (F1) and dimer (F2) were both present in the cells expressing ANGPTL4 that contained a single cysteine substitution (lanes 2, 3, 10, and 11). No band at the expected size of a tetramer (F4) was detected in these cells, perhaps because tetramer formation requires both cysteines to form a disulfide bond with different molecules of ANGPTL4. In cells in which alanines were substituted for both cysteine residues, only the monomer was present in the cells (lanes 4 and 12). Thus, as reported by Ge et al. (7Ge H. Yang G. Yu X. Pourbahrami T. Li C. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 2071-2079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), cysteines 76 and 80 in ANGPTL4 are required for oligomerization of the protein. Substitution of alanines for the cysteines in the N terminus did not interfere with the secretion of ANGPTL4 or with the cleavage of the protein. Levels of the C-terminal fragment in the three cysteine mutants were similar to that seen in the medium of cells expressing the wild-type protein (lanes 5-8). In contrast, the cysteine mutations significantly altered the pattern of bands observed with the N-terminal antibody. In the medium from cells expressing the single cysteine mutants, no monomers of the N-terminal fragment were seen (Fig. 4, lanes 14 and 15); only fragments of the expected size of the dimer of the N terminus (N2) and of the full-length protein (F2) were present. In addition, a band of ∼65 kDa was seen in the medium, which is the expected size of a full-length monomer linked to an N-terminal fragment. Mutating both cysteines resulted in no full-length oligomers forming in the cells or being detected in the medium (lanes 8 and 16). The C-terminal domain accumulated"
https://openalex.org/W1997296994,"Viral-mediated gene therapy presents many challenges in the clinic, including the potential for physiological effects that overshoot the intended goals. In a new report by Matthew During and his colleagues, the authors devise a scheme by which packaging of a microRNA into the virus, expressed under the control of a physiological response induced by the viral transgene, allows coordinated dampening of the transgene expression when the therapeutic response achieves a certain threshold. Hypothalamic brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a key element in the regulation of energy balance. Here we investigated the therapeutic efficacy of BDNF by gene transfer in mouse models of obesity and diabetes. Gene transfer of BDNF led to marked weight loss and alleviation of obesity-associated insulin resistance. To facilitate clinical translation and ensure that BDNF protein expression was appropriately decreased as weight loss progressed, thus preventing cachexia, we developed a molecular autoregulatory system involving a single recombinant adeno-associated virus vector harboring two expression cassettes, one constitutively driving BDNF and the other driving a specific microRNA targeting BDNF. The microRNA element was controlled by a promoter (that controlling the Agrp gene encoding agouti-related peptide) responsive to BDNF-induced physiological changes. Hence, as body weight decreased and agouti-related protein is induced, microRNA expression was activated, inhibiting transgene expression. In contrast to the progressive weight loss associated with a nonregulated approach, this microRNA-approach led to a sustainable plateau of body weight after notable weight loss was achieved. This strategy mimics the body's endogenous physiological feedback mechanisms, thereby resetting the hypothalamic set point to reverse obesity and metabolic syndrome."

https://openalex.org/W1976371644,"Deterministic evolution, phylogenetic contingency and evolutionary chance each can influence patterns of morphological diversification during adaptive radiation. In comparative studies of replicate radiations, convergence in a common morphospace implicates determinism, whereas non-convergence suggests the importance of contingency or chance.The endemic cichlid fish assemblages of the three African great lakes have evolved similar sets of ecomorphs but show evidence of non-convergence when compared in a common morphospace, suggesting the importance of contingency and/or chance. We then analyzed the morphological diversity of each assemblage independently and compared their axes of diversification in the unconstrained global morphospace. We find that despite differences in phylogenetic composition, invasion history, and ecological setting, the three assemblages are diversifying along parallel axes through morphospace and have nearly identical variance-covariance structures among morphological elements.By demonstrating that replicate adaptive radiations are diverging along parallel axes, we have shown that non-convergence in the common morphospace is associated with convergence in the global morphospace. Applying these complimentary analyses to future comparative studies will improve our understanding of the relationship between morphological convergence and non-convergence, and the roles of contingency, chance and determinism in driving morphological diversification."

Activation of keratinocyte intracellular signaling pathways is emerging as an important component of pemphigus IgG-mediated acantholysis. We previously reported activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in response to pathogenic pemphigus vulgaris and PF IgG. Inhibition of p38MAPK blocked pemphigus IgG-induced cytoskeletal reorganization in tissue culture and blistering in pemphigus mouse models. We now extend these observations by demonstrating two peaks of p38MAPK activation in pemphigus tissue culture and mouse models. Administration of the p38MAPK inhibitor SB202190 before PF IgG injection blocked both peaks of p38MAPK phosphorylation and blister formation, consistent with our previous findings; however, administration of the inhibitor 4 h after PF IgG injection blocked only the later peak of p38MAPK activation but failed to block blistering. Examination of the temporal relationship of p38MAPK phosphorylation and apoptosis showed that apoptosis occurs at or after the second peak of p38MAPK activation. The time course of p38MAPK activation and apoptotic markers, as well as the ability of inhibitors of p38MAPK to block activation of the proapoptotic proteinase caspase-3, suggest that activation of apoptosis is downstream to, and a consequence of, p38MAPK activation in pemphigus acantholysis. Furthermore, these observations suggest that the earlier peak of p38MAPK activation is part of the mechanism leading to acantholysis, whereas the later peak of p38MAPK and apoptosis may not be essential for acantholysis."

The short life-span of NO in blood requires a mechanism to retain NO bioactivity in the circulation. Recent studies have suggested a mechanism involving the reduction of nitrite back to NO by deoxyhemoglobin in RBCs. A role for RBCs in transporting NO must, however, bypass the scavenging of NO in RBCs by hemoglobin. To understand how the nitrite reaction can deliver bioactive NO to the vasculature, we have studied the intermediates formed during the reaction. A reliable measure of the total concentration of heme-associated nitrite/NO intermediates formed was provided by combining filtration to measure free nitrite by chemiluminescence and electron paramagnetic resonance to measure the final product Hb(II)NO. By modifying the chemiluminescence method used to detect NO, we have been able to identify two intermediates: 1) a heme-associated nitrite complex that is released as NO in acid solution in the presence of ascorbate and 2) an intermediate that releases NO at neutral pH in the presence of ferricyanide when reacted with an Fe(III) ligand like azide. This species designated as “Hb(II)NO+ ⇆ Hb(III)NO” has properties of both isomeric forms resulting in a slower NO dissociation rate and much higher stability than Hb(III)NO, but provides a potential source for bioactive NO, which can be released from the RBC.

This detailed analysis of the nitrite reaction with deoxyHb provides important insights into the mechanism for nitrite induced vasodilation by RBCs. Nitric oxide (NO), also known as the endothelium-derived relaxing factor, is an important messenger molecule involved in the regulation of vascular tone and blood flow (1Ignarro L.J. Cirino G. Casini A. Napoli C. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1999; 34: 879-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar).

Nitrite is present in the blood at fairly high levels (0.1–0.5 μmol/liter) (4Cosby K. Partovi K.S. Crawford J.H. Patel R.P. Reiter C.D. Martyr S. Yang B.K. Waclawiw M.A. Zalos G. Xu X. Huang K.T.

However, the mechanism by which the NO produced in the red cell by nitrite reduction is exported without being trapped or destroyed is still unclear. Recent studies by Rifkind and co-workers (5Nagababu E. Ramasamy S. Abernethy D.R. Rifkind J.M. J. Biol.

In this report, we quantitate the two intermediate species that are formed during the reduction of nitrite by deoxyHb when an excess of hemoglobin is present. We also demonstrate that one of the intermediate species designated as “Hb(II)NO+ ⇆ Hb(III)NO” has properties of Hb(II)NO+ and Hb(III)NO, respectively. This species has a slower NO dissociation rate and a much higher stability than Hb(III)NO. This intermediate is a potential source for bioactive NO that can be released from RBCs. Reagents—All reagents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich unless mentioned. Solution Preparations—All hemoglobin solutions were prepared in 50 mm NaCl and 4 mm phosphate buffer (PBS), pH 7.4. DeoxyHb Preparation—Human hemoglobin was purified from fresh hemolysate by gel filtration using a Sephadex G-100 column equilibrated with PBS, pH 7.4 at 4 °C. A 1 mm hemoglobin solution was deoxygenated in an anaerobic Coy glove box until the visible spectrum of hemoglobin corresponded to that of deoxyHb. A 0.1-cm path length cuvette was used for spectroscopic measurements of the 1 mm hemoglobin solutions. Hb(II)NO Preparation—NO gas (2.5%) was purified, by passing through concentrated NaOH (5 m). Small amounts of this purified gas were transferred to a septum-sealed 100 μm deoxyHb solution to produce Hb(II)NO as confirmed by visible spectroscopy. The Hb(II)NO was then quickly passed down a Sephadex G-25 column anaerobically to remove unreacted NO. The final concentration of Hb(II)NO was determined by visible spectroscopy using the millimolar extinction coefficient for Hb(II)NO of 11.4 at 544 nm. The Hb(II)NO standard solution (∼44 μm) was flushed with inert gas, and stored in the freezer at –150 °C. MetHb Preparation—Purified human hemoglobin (∼1.5 mm) was oxidized with a 50 mm solution of K3Fe(CN)6 (50 μl/ml) for 5 mins. K3Fe(CN)6 was removed from the metHb solution by gel filtration using a Sephadex G-25 column equilibrated with PBS, pH 7.4. The final concentration of metHb was determined by visible spectroscopy using the millimolar extinction coefficient for metHb of 4.4 at 631 nm. The metHb standard solution (∼0.75 mm) was stored in the freezer at –150 °C. Nitrite Preparation—A 10 mm nitrite solution was prepared by dissolving NaNO–2 in 10 ml of an argon-saturated PBS solution, pH 7.4. Nitrite Reduction by DeoxyHb—All experiments were carried out inside an anaerobic Coy glove box. 1 mm deoxyHb was reacted with 0.25 mm nitrite in PBS, pH 7.4 for 60 min at room temperature (22 °C). The free (non-reacted nitrite) was determined as a function of time by filtering aliquots of the reaction mixture at different time intervals using 10,000 mol. wt. cutoff microfilterfuge tubes (Rainin Instrument Co. Inc. filters) inside the anaerobic glove box. The amount of nitrite in the filtrate was determined by chemiluminescence (see below). The total nitrite reacted with hemoglobin was calculated by subtracting the free nitrite from the initial nitrite added. Aliquots of the same reaction mixture were used to determine Hb(II)NO by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). NOA Chemiluminescence Assays—A Model-280 Nitric Oxide Analyzer (NOA) from Sievers Instruments was used to determine free nitrite and the various heme-associated nitrite/NO species. The NOA purge vessel was also kept inside the glove box and gas lines were connected through the gas ports of the glove box to the argon gas tank and the instrument. Argon was bubbled through the purge vessel to carry any released NO to the detector, which quantitates NO by measuring the gas-phase chemiluminescence NO reaction with ozone. The glove box temperature was maintained at 30 °C. The computer was operated using a wireless mouse from inside the glove box. Determination of Hb(II)NO and Nitrite Standards by Chemiluminescence—5-μl injections of 5.5, 11, 22, 33, and 44 μm solutions of Hb(II)NO prepared by appropriate dilutions of the stock Hb(II)NO standard solution (∼44 μm) previously described, were injected into the purge vessel that contained 1.5 ml of 0.8 m K3Fe(CN)6 plus 6.5 ml of 85% glacial acetic acid with 100 mm sulfanilamide to release the NO. The concentration dependent chemiluminescence signals for Hb(II)NO were used to prepare a calibration curve. Similarly, 5 μl of 5, 10, 20, 40, and 80 μm nitrite standard solutions prepared by appropriate dilutions of the stock 10 mm nitrite standard were injected into the purge vessel that contained 7 ml of glacial acetic acid and 1 ml of 0.5 m ascorbic acid to obtain a calibration curve for nitrite. Four injections were made for each sample using a Hamilton gas-tight syringe. The data were transferred to Origin 6.1 software program and the area of under the peak of each signal was integrated. The Hb(II)NO and nitrite standard curves were prepared by plotting the area of each standard against its concentration. The nitric oxide concentration of unknown samples was determined using the Hb(II)NO or nitrite standard curve prepared under the same conditions. Determination of Free Nitrite by Chemiluminescence—5 ml of a 1 mm deoxyHb solution in a mini Petri dish was reacted with 0.25 mm nitrite inside the anaerobic glove box for 60 min at room temperature. At specific time intervals a 0.5 ml aliquot of the reaction mixture was placed into a microfilterfuge tube (Rainin filter with a 10,000 MW cutoff) and centrifuged for 2 min at 6,500 rpm using a microfuge (LK Scientific). After centrifugation, the filtration solutions were diluted accordingly, and 5 μl of the filtrate obtained at various time intervals was injected into the NOA purge vessel containing 7 ml of glacial acetic acid and 1 ml of 0.5 m ascorbic acid in order to determine the concentration of nitrite as previously described (16Nagababu E. Rifkind J.M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2007; 42: 1146-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Simultaneously, at each time interval, 0.4 ml of the remaining reaction mixture were placed anaerobically into 4-mm clear fused quartz EPR tubes (707 SQ250M-WILMAND) and frozen by submerging into liquid nitrogen for Hb(II)NO analysis by EPR. Determination of Heme-NO Species by Chemiluminescence—1 mm deoxyHb solution contained in a septum-sealed cuvette, was reacted with 0.25 mm nitrite. 5 μl of the reaction mixture were withdrawn at varying time points and injected into the NOA purge vessel containing various reagents (see below) to determine the amount of different NO-related species (products) formed (released) from the reaction mixture. Reaction System for Determination of Heme-NO Species under Acidic Conditions—The purge vessel contained 1.5 ml of 0.8 m K3Fe(CN)6 plus 6.5 ml of 85% glacial acetic acid with 100 mm sulfanilamide for determination of exclusively heme-NO species. For determination of heme-NO species and part of nitrite, sulfanilamide was not added to the purge vessel. For determination of heme-associated nitrite/NO species and any free nitrite, no sulfanilamide was present in the purge vessel but 0.5 m ascorbate was added, so that the purge vessel contained 1.5 ml of 0.8 m K3Fe(CN)6 plus 1.0 ml of 0.5 m ascorbic acid and 5.5 ml of glacial acetic acid. For determination of heme-associated nitrite/NO species without free nitrite the purge vessel contained 1.5 ml of 0.8 m K3Fe(CN)6 plus 1.0 ml of 0.5 m ascorbic acid and 5.5 ml of glacial acetic that contained 100 mm sulfanilamide. The total volume of each reaction system was 8 ml. Potassium ferricyanide was used to help release the NO from Hb(II)NO by oxidizing the hemoglobin. Sulfanilamide was used to react with nitrite under acidic conditions to eliminate the NO signal coming from nitrite. Acetic acid enhances the release of NO from Hb(II)NO and prevents protein foam formation. Ascorbic acid is a strong reducing agent that will reduce any nitrite to NO under acidic conditions. In the presence of sulfanilamide it provides a measure of the total nitrite associated or reacted with hemoglobin except for nitrosated (thiol nitrosylated) species that are stable in acid. Determination of Heme-NO species from the Residue—1 mm deoxyHb and 0.25 mm nitrite were reacted for 60 min, the reaction mixture was then filtered to completion in a microfilter (Rainin filter with 10,000 MW cutoff) using a microfuge (LK Scientific) at 6,500 rpm. The residue on the filter was resuspended in PBS buffer pH 7.4 to an initial volume. The residue was analyzed by chemiluminescence at acidic pH with added ascorbate but without sulfanilamide (see above). Reaction System for Determination of Heme-NO Species under Neutral Conditions—The purge vessel contained 0.2 m K3Fe(CN)6 in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 0.1 ml of anti-foam reagent with or without 1 mm sodium azide for a total volume of 8 ml. Azide binds to Fe(III) and was used to release NO from the intermediate species “Hb(II)NO+ ⇆ Hb(III)NO”. Although Hb(III)NO releases NO readily even at neutral pH, the different isoforms present in this species stabilizes the bound NO preventing the release of this NO at neutral pH. However, the interaction of azide with the Fe(III) isoform of this complex, is nevertheless, able to release NO. Determination of Heme-NO Species from the Reaction of metHb with Nitrite and Nitrate—250 μm metHb solution in PBS buffer, pH 7.4 was mixed with a nitrite solution (at 1:1, 1:2, and 1:5, metHb:nitrite ratios) or a nitrate solution (at 1:1, metHb:nitrate ratio) in a septum-sealed cuvette. The reaction mixture was then analyzed by chemiluminescence at neutral pH in the presence of 1 mm sodium azide (see above). Determination of Heme-NO Species from the Reaction of oxyHb with Nitrite and Nitrate—250 μm oxyHb solution in PBS buffer, pH 7.4 was mixed with a nitrite solution (at 1:1, oxyHb: nitrite ratio) or a nitrate solution (at 1:1, oxyHb:nitrate ratio). The reaction mixture was then analyzed by for the formation of heme-NO species by chemiluminescence at neutral pH in the presence of 1 mm sodium azide (see above). Determination of Heme-NO Species from the Reaction of metHb and NO—100 μm metHb was reacted with 100 μm NO obtained from a NO-saturated PBS buffer, pH 7.4 solution in a septum-sealed cuvette for 60 min. The reaction mixture was then analyzed by chemiluminescence at neutral pH in the absence and presence of 1 mm sodium azide (see above). EPR Measurements—EPR spectra were measured using a Bruker EMX-61A spectrometer with an Oxford continuous flow ESR-900 cryogenic unit. An Oxford ITC 502 temperature controller was used to maintain the sample temperature in the cavity at 10 K with an Oxford VC41 gas flow controller for liquid helium flow through the cryostat. EPR spectra were recorded in the region of 500–4500 G with a sweep time of 335.54 s, a time constant of 80.42 ms, 2 milliwatt power, and 100 kHz modulation frequency. Determination of Hb(II)NO Standards by EPR—The Hb(II)NO standard solution (see above) was diluted accordingly with anaerobic 3× diluted PBS, pH 7.4 to make 0.4-ml Hb(II)NO standards of 44, 33, 22, 11, and 5.5 μm. The 0.4-ml aliquots were transferred anaerobically into 4-mm clear fused quartz EPR tubes (707 SQ250M-WILMAD), and frozen by submerging the tubes into liquid nitrogen. The samples were stored in the freezer at –150 °C until recorded. The EPR spectrum of each Hb(II)NO standard was recorded, and the region from 3150–3550 gauss (g = 2 signal) was integrated using the Bruker WINEPR software version 2.22 revision 10. A standard calibration curve for Hb(II)NO was produced which compared the concentration of Hb(II)NO versus the double integration obtained for each standard. Determination of metHb Spectrum by EPR—The EPR spectrum of the metHb standard solution (see above) was recorded in the region of 900–3550 gauss. Determination of Heme-NO Species Formed during the Reaction of deoxyHb with Nitrite by EPR—0.25 mm nitrite was reacted with a 1 mm deoxyHb in an anaerobic glove box. At various time intervals, 0.4-ml aliquots were transferred into 4-mm EPR tubes and immediately frozen by submerging into liquid nitrogen. The EPR signal was measured from 900 to 3550 gauss. The reaction of nitrite with deoxyHb produces metHb as well as Hb(II)NO, both of which have EPR signals in the g = 2 region. To quantitate the formation of Hb(II)NO it was, therefore, necessary to correct the Hb(II)NO spectrum in the g = 2 region from the contribution of metHb. For this purpose, the spectrum of a metHb standard was recorded, which resulted in signals in the g = 6 (900–1300 gauss) and g = 2 (3150–3550 gauss) regions. Because the g = 6 region observed in the spectrum of the reaction mixture contains the dominant contribution from metHb, but no contribution from Hb(II)NO, it was possible to use the g = 6 amplitude in the region of 900–1300 gauss to quantitate the formation of metHb. Furthermore, the amplitude contribution from metHb in the g = 2 region, overlapping with the Hb(II)NO contribution was determined by subtracting the metHb standard from the sample spectrum using the WINEPR algebra/subtraction function. The resulting spectrum corresponded to a spectrum with a corrected g = 2 amplitude of the Hb(II)NO signal in the region from 3150–3550 gauss. From the corrected spectra, the concentration of Hb(II)NO was determined during nitrite reduction using the Hb(II)NO standard curve. Filtration Studies to Determine the Total Nitrite Reacted with deoxyHb—Nitrite reduction by deoxyHb involves the proton-assisted reduction of nitrite to NO (Reaction 1). Hb(II)+NO2−+H+→Hb(III)+NO+OH−REACTION 1 The released NO will rapidly bind to deoxygenated hemoglobin chains producing nitrosylhemoglobin (Hb(II)NO) (Reaction 2) (20Doyle M.P. Pickering R.A. DeWeert T.M. Hoekstra J.W. Pater D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12393-12398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Hb(II)+NO→Hb(II)NOREACTION 2 or react with any oxygenated hemoglobin chains producing metHb and nitrate (Reaction 3) (21Lissi E. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 24: 1535-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Hb(II)O2+NO→Hb(III)+NO3−REACTION 3 In the absence of oxygen all of the reduced nitrite should react with deoxyHb to produce Hb(II)NO. In our original study on nitrite reduction, we compared the level of Hb(II)NO determined by EPR with a chemiluminescence method designed to measure total heme-associated NO (5Nagababu E. Ramasamy S. Abernethy D.R. Rifkind J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46349-46356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). The finding that the chemiluminescence signal accounted for appreciably more NO than EPR indicated the presence of a significant pool of NO associated with hemoglobin that was not Hb(II)NO. This finding indicated that there are intermediate species formed in Reaction 1 before NO is released. Other investigators (14Kim-Shapiro D.B. Gladwin M.T. Patel R.P. Hogg N. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2005; 99: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) have, however, challenged the implied stability of any hemoglobin associated intermediates. While EPR as a measure of Hb(II)NO is accepted, the validity of low pH chemiluminescence to measure heme-associated NO species can be open to uncertainties (the chemiluminescence method used in that study involved ferricyanide in acetic acid to release all the heme-associated NO and sulfanilamide to react with any free nitrite present). In a subsequent study (22Nagababu E. Ramasamy S. Rifkind J.M. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 11650-11659Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), we used visible spectroscopy to analyze the species formed when nitrite reacts with deoxyHb at neutral pH. The analysis of this data supported the formation of a metastable intermediate, but was unable to delineate the actual visible spectrum of the intermediate leaving open uncertainties about the intermediates formed. A determination of free nitrite as a function of time and a comparison of the nitrite consumed with the EPR determined Hb(II)NO is the most direct way to determine whether metastable intermediates are formed. For this purpose we designed a rapid filtration method that makes it possible to collect the unreacted nitrite from the reaction between deoxyHb and nitrite as a function of time. Fig. 1A shows that the concentration of unreacted nitrite (free nitrite) removed from the reaction mixture (1 mm deoxyHb and 0.25 mm nitrite) at various time intervals up to 60 min exponentially decreases as a function of time. The amount of nitrite consumed (decrease in the free nitrite concentration) as the reaction proceeds is a direct measure of the heme-associated nitrite/NO species that are produced. After 60 min of reaction time only 29 μm of the original 250 μm is free, indicating that > 88% of the nitrite has reacted with hemoglobin. However, Fig. 1B indicates that the nitrite consumed is much greater than the Hb(II)NO determined by EPR, which is 43 μm instead of the 221 μm calculated from the filtration experiment. To determine whether the nitrite consumed reflects the nitrite associated with the hemoglobin, we collected the hemoglobin residue after all the low molecular weight material was removed at the end of a 60-min reaction time. We then determined the total chemiluminescence signal of the residue in acidic pH (acetic acid with K3Fe(CN)6 and ascorbate) in order to determine all possible heme-associated NO species. As shown in Fig. 1B the observed chemiluminescence of the residue corresponds to 201 μm of the original nitrite added or 91% of the nitrite consumed. The EPR, therefore, does not detect 158 μm or 78.6% of the nitrite that has reacted with hemoglobin. The comparison of the total consumed nitrite (221 μm) with the total nitrite reacted products detected in the hemoglobin residue (201 μm) results in only 20 μm (8%) not accounted for. This discrepancy can be attributed to other low molecular weight species not detected by this chemiluminescence method and/or to the formation of SNO-Hb, which would also not be detected by low pH chemiluminescence (13Nagababu E. Ramasamy S. Rifkind J.M. Nitric. Oxide. 2006; 15: 20-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Chemiluminescence Determination of an Intermediate Released from Hemoglobin as NO by Ascorbate—The filtration experiment (Fig. 1) in comparison to the EPR data indicates that other heme-NO species in addition to Hb(II)NO are formed during the nitrite reaction. Our earlier studies used ferricyanide in acetic acid with a large excess of sulfanilamide to measure what we assumed to be the total heme-associated nitrite/NO species. By this method the non-reacted (free) nitrite was removed by sulfanilamide and the ferricyanide in acid was assumed to release NO from all heme-associated NO species except SNO-Hb, which is stabilized in acid solution. As shown in Fig. 2A, the chemiluminescence signal under these conditions after 60 min of reaction time accounted for only 100 μm (45.2% of the nitrite consumed or 49.8% of the total heme-associated NO species as indicated by the chemiluminescence of the residue). The finding that the signal intensity is"

However, the roles of T2SS and T4P in the virulence of extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli have not been determined. Methodology/Principal Findings To investigate the functions of putative T2SS and T4P gene clusters present in the model uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) strains UTI89 and CFT073, we deleted the secretin gene present in each cluster. The secretin forms a channel in the outer membrane that is essential for the function of T2S and T4P systems. We compared the secretin deletion mutants with their wild type counterparts using tissue culture assays and the CBA/J mouse model of ascending urinary tract infection. No deficiencies were observed with any of the mutants in adherence, invasion or replication in human bladder or kidney cell lines, but UTI89 ΔhofQ and UTI89 ΔgspD exhibited approximately 2-fold defects in fluxing out of bladder epithelial cells. In the mouse infection model, each of the knockout mutants was able to establish successful infections in the bladder and kidneys by day one post-infection. However, UTI89 ΔhofQ and a CFT073 ΔhofQ ΔyheF double mutant both exhibited defects in colonizing the kidneys by day seven post-infection. Conclusions/Significance Based on our results, we propose that the putative T4P and T2S systems are virulence determinants of UPEC important for persistence in the urinary tract, particularly in renal tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2013165897,"During homologous recombination, a number of proteins cooperate to catalyze the loading of recombinases onto single-stranded DNA. Single-stranded DNA-binding proteins stimulate recombination by coating single-stranded DNA and keeping it free of secondary structure; however, in order for recombinases to load on single-stranded-DNA-binding protein-coated DNA, the activity of a class of proteins known as recombination mediators is required. Mediator proteins coordinate the handoff of single-stranded DNA from single-stranded DNA-binding protein to recombinase. Here we show that a complex of Mei5 and Sae3 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae preferentially binds single-stranded DNA and relieves the inhibition of the strand assimilation and DNA binding abilities of the meiotic recombinase Dmc1 imposed by the single-stranded DNA-binding protein replication protein A. Additionally, we demonstrate the physical interaction of Mei5-Sae3 with replication protein A. Our results, together with previous in vivo studies, indicate that Mei5-Sae3 is a mediator of Dmc1 assembly during meiotic recombination in S. cerevisiae."
https://openalex.org/W2001715059,"Our work suggests an important new link between the RCAN1 gene and Huntington disease. Huntington disease is caused by expansion of glutamine repeats in the huntingtin protein. How the huntingtin protein with expanded polyglutamines (mutant huntingtin) causes the disease is still unclear, but phosphorylation of huntingtin appears to be protective. Increased huntingtin phosphorylation can be produced either by inhibition of the phosphatase calcineurin or by activation of the Akt kinase. The RCAN1 gene encodes regulators of calcineurin, and we now demonstrate, for the first time, that RCAN1-1L is depressed in Huntington disease. We also show that RCAN1-1L overexpression can protect against mutant huntingtin toxicity in an ST14A cell culture model of Huntington disease and that increased phosphorylation of huntingtin via calcineurin inhibition, rather than via Akt induction or activation, is the likely mechanism by which RCAN1-1L may be protective against mutant huntingtin. These findings suggest that RCAN1-1L ""deficiency"" may actually play a role in the etiology of Huntington disease. In addition, our results allow for the possibility that controlled overexpression of RCAN1-1L in the striatal region of the brain might be a viable avenue for therapeutic intervention in Huntington disease patients (and perhaps other polyglutamine expansion disorders)."

After translocation across the plasma membrane, P2 precursor species arise from removal of the signal peptide from P1 precursors by a signal peptidase (16Budzik J.M. Marraffini L.A. Souda P.

Bacillus cereus pili are composed of two subunits; that is, the major pilin, BcpA, and the minor pilin, BcpB (15Budzik J.M. Marraffini L.A. Schneewind O. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 66: 495-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In contrast to BcpA, which is deposited throughout the pilus, BcpB is found at fiber tip (15Budzik J.M. Marraffini L.A. Schneewind O. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 66: 495-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Sortase D cleaves the BcpA LPXTG motif sorting signal between the threonine and glycine residues to form an amide bond to the ϵ-amino group of the lysine within the YPKN motif of adjacent BcpA subunits (16Budzik J.M.

However, sortase A also cleaves BcpA precursors, which are subsequently linked to the side chain amino group of meso-diaminopimelic acid within lipid II (19Budzik J.M. Oh S.Y. Schneewind O. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 36676-36686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).

The conservation of sortase D, the YPKN motif, and C-terminal sorting signal in major pilin subunits suggest a universal pilus assembly mechanism among Gram-positive bacteria (14Ton-That H.

However, the molecular mechanism whereby bacilli deposit BcpB, the minor pilin, at the tip of BcpA pili is not known. Although the BcpB precursor harbors an N-terminal signal peptide and a C-terminal IPNTG sorting signal, it lacks the YPKN pilin motif of the major subunit (15Budzik J.M. Marraffini L.A. Schneewind O. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 66: 495-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the substrate properties of the BcpB IPNTG sorting signal for the four classes of sortases expressed by bacilli has yet to be established. Plasmids—The following plasmids contain B. cereus pilus genes cloned under control of the spac promoter of pLM5 (12Marraffini L.A. Schneewind O. Mol.

Marraffini L.A. Schneewind O. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 66: 495-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). pJB182 encodes for bcpA-srtD-bcpBΔVIPNTGG719, which contains a seven-residue deletion in BcpB, encompassing the IPNTG sorting signal motif and one residue flanking each end (VIPNTGG719). pJB12 was used as a template in site-directed mutagenesis with Pfu polymerase, as described previously (15Budzik J.M. Marraffini L.A. Schneewind O. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 66: 495-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), with primer pairs P128 and P129 Table 1. pJB139 encodes for bcpA-srtD-bcpB with a MH6 tag inserted six nucleotides upstream from the codons encoding for the IPNTG motif in bcpB. pJB139 was created by quick change with primer pair P237/P238 and pJB12 template DNA. Amplified product was digested with NheI and ligated, and non-methylated plasmid DNA was digested with DpnI before transformation into Escherichia coli DH5-α. pJB139 was amplified with primer pairs P105/106 to alter the sorting signal of BcpA, creating pJB202 (bcpALAVAA-srtD-bcpBMH6). P197/198 and P124/125 were used with template pJB202 to introduce two substitutions in bcpA (N163A and V170M), creating pJB213 (bcpALAVAA N163A-srtD-bcpBMH6). pJB174 encodes for srtD-bcpB-gst cloned in pLM5. pJB174 was created by amplification of B. cereus DNA with primers 251/293 and pGEX2T DNA with primers 294/253. Amplified DNA was digested with XbaI/NcoI and NcoI/KpnI, respectively and ligated into pLM5 digested with XbaI and KpnI. P254/253 were used to amplify bcpB-gst from the template pJB174. The amplified DNA was digested with PstI and KpnI and ligated into pJB12 also digested with PstI and KpnI, thereby generating pJB203 (bcpA-srtD-bcpB-GST). pJB205 (bcpA-srtDC207A-bcpB-GST) contains the active site sortase D cysteine 207 to alanine substitution and was created by site-directed mutagenesis with pJB203 as a template and primers P173 and P174. pSY8 encodes for the cell wall sorting signal of BcpA fused to IsdX1 at its N terminus and GST 3The abbreviations used are: GST, glutathione S-transferase; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization; HMW, high molecular weight; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; RP, reverse phase; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. at its C terminus. Plasmid pSY40 contains a substitution in the pentapeptide motif of the LPVTG motif of BcpA to the IPNTG motif of BcpB and was generated by quick change using pSY8 as a template and primers P45/P46. To swap the cell-wall sorting signal of BcpA with the cell-wall sorting signal of BcpB in pSY8, pSY8 (isdX1-bcpASS-gst-srtD) was digested with PstI and NheI. The BcpB cell-wall sorting signal was amplified with primers P47 and P48 and digested with PstI/NheI. The purified plasmid fragment was ligated with the digested BcpB PCR product resulting in pSY41. Plasmid variants lacking srtD were generated by QuikChange™. Primers P88/P89 with pSY40 or pSY41 as a template generated pSY51 (isdX1-hybridSS-gst) or pSY52 (isdX1-bcpBSS-gst), respectively. Plasmids were transformed into the dam-dcm- E. coli host strain K1077 before transformation into Bacillus anthracis strain Sterne or its isogenic variant AHG263 (srtA::ermC).TABLE 1Primers used in this study Lowercase letters indicate the sequence of the restriction site inserted.

Marraffini L.A. Schneewind O. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 66: 495-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Pilus Assembly—Bacilli were harvested after incubation for 20 h at 30 °C in the presence of 1.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and 20 μm kanamycin. Bacilli were sedimented and boiled in 6 m urea, 1% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.5, for 10 min. The extracted material was washed with double-distilled H2O, precipitated with 8% trichloroacetic acid, and washed once with 0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.3, and then twice with 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.3. For immunoblots with α-BcpA and α-BcpB antisera, 3 ml of cell culture was digested with 100 units of mutanolysin in 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.3, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl chloride. For purification of BcpBMH6-BcpA from B. anthracis strains harboring pJB213, 6 liters of cell culture were digested with 20,000 units of mutanolysin, and cells were processed as described previously (19Budzik J.M. Oh S.Y. Schneewind O. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 36676-36686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 16 h, and the solubilized cell wall species was subjected to immunoblotting and purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. For immunoblots of pili from B. anthracis Sterne variants (srtA::ermC), aliquots were precipitated with 7% trichloroacetic acid, incubated on ice for 30 min, and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min. The sediment was washed with 500 μl of acetone, air-dried, and suspended in 500 μl of 4% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Purification of BcpBMH6-BcpA—After cell wall digestion, insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 33,000 × g. The pH of the sample was adjusted to 7.5 with 2 m sodium phosphate dibasic, and BcpBMH6-BcpA was purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography (11Marraffini L.A. Schneewind O. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16263-16271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Purification of BcpB-BcpA Peptides—Purified BcpBMH6-BcpA was methanol-chloroform-precipitated and cleaved with CNBr (11Marraffini L.A. Schneewind O. J. Biol.

BcpBH6-BcpA was purified by a second round of Ni-NTA affinity chromatography under denaturing conditions and separated by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) with UV detection using a C18 column with a linear gradient from 1 to 99% acetonitrile (CH3CN) in 0.1% formic acid in 100 min, as previously reported for BcpA pilin peptides (16Budzik J.M. Marraffini L.A. Souda P. Whitelegge J.P. Faull K.F. Schneewind O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2008; 283: 36676-36686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Mass Spectrometry—Aliquots of RP-HPLC fractions (0.5 μl) were co-spotted with matrix (0.5 μl of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid) prepared at 10 mg/ml in CH3CN-water-trifluoroacetic acid (30:40:0.1). Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI)-mass spectrometry spectra were obtained in a reflectron time-of-flight instrument (ABI Biosystems MALDI 4700) in reflectron mode. Spectra were acquired using external calibration with bovine insulin. Theoretical parent ion and fragmentation ion monoisotopic m/z values were produced with ProteinProspector version 5.1.8 Basic MSProduct web-based program (University of California, San Francisco). Edman Degradation—RP-HPLC samples of anchor peptides were dried under vacuum and submitted for Edman sequencing at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign Biotechnology Center Protein Sciences Facility. IsdX1-BcpBSS-GST cleavage products were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, stained with Amido Black, and submitted for Edman degradation. Electron Microscopy—Double labeling experiments with α-BcpA antisera and 10-nm gold anti-rabbit IgG conjugates followed by α-BcpB antisera and 15-nm gold anti-rabbit IgG conjugates were performed as described previously (15Budzik J.M. Marraffini L.A. Schneewind O. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 66: 495-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The Sorting Signal of the Minor Pilin Is Required for Its Assembly into Pili—When transformed with pJB12, a plasmid encoding the B. cereus pilin operon (bcpA, srtD, bcpB), B. anthracis Sterne forms pili comprising both the major pilin subunit, BcpA, and the minor pilin subunit, BcpB (Fig. 1A) (15Budzik J.M. Marraffini L.A. Schneewind O. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 66: 495-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Lysates of bacilli were examined by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting for the polymerization of pilin subunits. High molecular weight BcpAHMW and BcpBHMW species represent covalently linked pilin subunits within pilus fibers (Fig. 1B). As expected, B. anthracis expressing bcpA and srtD but not bcpB (pJB39) formed exclusively BcpAHMW species, indicating that the major pilin is polymerized in the absence of BcpB (Fig. 1B) (15Budzik J.M. Marraffini L.A. Schneewind O. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 66: 495-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Substitution of lysine 162 of BcpA (K of the YPKN pilin motif) with alanine (pJB28, bcpAK162A, srtD, bcpB) abrogates polymerization of both BcpAK162A and BcpB into high molecular weight species (BcpBHMW) and caused the accumulation of pilin precursors, BcpAP and BcpBP (Fig. 1B) (15Budzik J.M. Marraffini L.A. Schneewind O. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 66: 495-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Deletion of the IPNTG peptide in the sorting signal of BcpB (pJB182, bcpA, srtD, bcpBΔIPNTG) abolishes the formation of BcpBHMW without affecting BcpA polymerization (Fig. 1B). Thus, the BcpB C-terminal sorting signal is required for the incorporation of the minor pilin subunit into pili but is otherwise dispensable for the polymerization of BcpA. The BcpB Sorting Signal Is Cleaved by Sortase D—To examine BcpB sorting signal cleavage, we generated a translational hybrid between the minor pilin 3′ coding end and the 5′ end of glutathione S-transferase (gst) (Fig. 2A). B. anthracis Sterne (wild-type sortase A) and an isogenic srtA deletion variant (srtA::ermC) (21Gaspar A.H. Marraffini L.A. Glass E.M. DeBord K.L. Ton-That H. Schneewind O. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 4646-4655Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) were transformed with plasmids encoding the BcpB-GST hybrid, BcpA, and either wild-type sortase D (bcpA, srtD, bcpB-gst) or the active site mutant, C207A (bcpA, srtDC207A, bcpB-gst). Pilus assembly in bacilli was assessed by immunoblotting as before. Wild-type sortase D assembled BcpAHMW, whereas the C207A variant of sortase D did not form pili and accumulated the BcpA precursor (Fig. 2B). Similarly, wild-type sortase D yielded BcpBHMW, whereas the C207A sortase D variant accumulated BcpB-GST precursor (Fig. 2C). Immunoblotting with antibodies raised against purified GST detected the BcpB-GST precursor (P1/P2) as well as the mature C-terminal GST fragment released by sortase D cleavage (M, Fig. 2D). In contrast, bacilli expressing the C207A sortase D variant were unable to process minor subunit precursors. Furthermore, BcpB-GST cleavage is independent of sortase A, indicating that sortase D, but not sortases A, B, or C, is able to recognize BcpB substrate (Fig. 2D). Electron microscopy of immunogold labeled pili on the surface of bacilli demonstrates that GST fusion to the C terminus of BcpB does not affect pilus assembly (Fig. 2E). Mutants lacking sortase A successfully assemble pili on the bacterial surface, although they are abundantly shed into the extracellular medium (Fig. 2E). Mutants expressing the C207A variant of sortase D fail to form pili (Fig. 2E). The BcpB Sorting Signal Determines Sortase D Substrate Specificity—B. anthracis as well as closely related B. cereus species secrete IsdX1, a hemophore that scavenges heme iron from host hemoglobin (22Maresso A.W. Garufi G. Schneewind O. PLoS Pathog. 2008; 4: e1000132Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We selected IsdX1 as a reporter because this protein is known to travel along the bacterial secretory pathway but is not associated with pili. IsdX1-BcpASS-GST is a translational hybrid between IsdX1, the sorting signal of BcpA (BcpASS) and E. coli glutathione S-transferase (Fig. 3A) (19Budzik J.M. Oh S.Y. Schneewind O. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 36676-36686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Cleavage of the hybrid precursor (P1/P2) into the mature form (M) was monitored by immunoblotting with α-GST serum (Fig. 3A). IsdX1-BcpASS-GST was cleaved in bacilli expressing sortase A and/or sortase D, indicating that the sorting signal of BcpA is recognized by both sortases (Fig. 3B) (19Budzik J.M. Oh S.Y. Schneewind O. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 36676-36686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The LPVTG peptide within BcpASS was replaced with IPNTG, the peptide found in the BcpB sorting signal, thereby creating IsdX1-HybridSS-GST (Fig. 3A). Sortase A cleaves the IsdX1-HybridSS-GST less efficiently than the IsdX1-BcpASS-GST. However, the abundance of mature products in bacilli expressing sortase D appeared similar for both substrates (Fig. 3B). A third fusion, IsdX1-BcpBSS-GST, encompasses the sorting signal of BcpB. This hybrid was cleaved in bacilli expressing sortase D but not in bacteria that lacked this transpeptidase (Fig. 3B). In bacilli expressing IsdX1-BcpASS-GST, sortase A attached IsdX1 to the cell wall envelope. In contrast, sortase A-mediated cell wall anchoring of IsdX1 could not be detected in bacilli expressing either IsdX1-HybridSS-GST or IsdX1-BcpBSS-GST (Fig. 3C). Lysates of B. anthracis Sterne expressing IsdX1-BcpBSS-GST were subjected to affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose. Eluate was analyzed by Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE, which revealed the P1/P2 precursors (50 kDa) and the mature sortase D-derived C-terminal cleavage fragment of IsdX1-BcpBSS-GST (31 kDa, Fig. 3D). The 38-kDa polypeptide in the eluate likely represents B. anthracis GST; this species did not react with antibodies against IsdX1 or E. coli GST (Fig. 3B). Edman degradation of the 31-kDa C-terminal sortase D cleavage product of IsdX1-BcpBSS-GST generated the amino acid sequence GGSGTTIFY, which matches the predicted sequence of the BcpBSS immediately after the threonine of the IPNTG motif (Table 2). Thus, sortase D cleaves the BcpB sorting signal between the threonine and the glycine of its IPNTG sorting signal.TABLE 2Edman degradation of IsdX1-BcpBSS-GST product of sortase DCycleAmino acidpm1Gly (15.28)2Gly (14.81)3Ser (7.39)4Gly (12.14)5Thr (17.77)6Thr (17.21)7Ile (14.10)8Phe (11.06)9Tyr (10.45) Open table in a new tab Sortase D Incorporates BcpB into Pili of B. anthracis—We asked whether BcpB is incorporated into pili in the absence of sortase A, i.e. when these fibers cannot be immobilized in the cell wall envelope. B. anthracis (srtA::ermC) was transformed with pJB12 (bcpA, srtD, bcpB) or pJB39 (bcpA, srtD) (Fig. 4A). The srtA mutant bacilli released pili derived from either plasmid into the culture medium (Fig. 4C). Pili in the medium were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and examined by immunoblot probed with α-BcpB and α-BcpA antisera (Fig. 4B). BcpAHMW was identified within polymerized pili derived from both plasmids, whereas BcpBHMW was only detected in the pili of pJB12 (bcpA, srtD, bcpB) transformants (Fig. 4B). The localization of BcpB in both cell-associated pili and released pili was established via immunogold labeling and electron microscopy. BcpA was detected with 10-nm immunogold conjugates along the shaft of pili that were displayed on the surface of bacilli or released into the culture medium (Fig. 4C). BcpB was detected with 15-nm immunogold conjugates at the tip of pili that were either displayed on the bacterial surface or released into the culture medium (Fig. 4C). BcpB-specific immunogold labeling was not detected in pili that were formed without bcpB (pJB39) (Fig. 4C). Together, these results suggest that sortase A is dispensable for the incorporation of BcpB into pili and that BcpB is deposited at the tip of BcpA pili irrespective of pilus surface attachment. The Bond between BcpB and BcpA—B. anthracis (pJB48) encodes a mutant BcpA with a scrambled LPXTG motif sorting signal (LAVAA) that cannot be cleaved by sortases A and D and, consequently, cannot be incorporated into pili or the cell wall envelope (Fig. 5A) (15Budzik J.M. Marraffini L.A. Schneewind O. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 66: 495-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). As expected, immunoblotting of B. anthracis (pJB48) cell wall extracts did not reveal polymerized BcpAHMW or BcpBHMW (Fig. 5B) (15Budzik J.M. Marraffini L.A. Schneewind O. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 66: 495-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, B. anthracis (pJB48) accumulated a 180-kDa species immunoreactive against both BcpA and BcpB sera (15Budzik J.M. Marraffini L.A. Schneewind O. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 66: 495-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We reasoned these species must represent the sortase D transpeptidation product BcpB-BcpALAVAA (15Budzik J.M. Marraffini L.A. Schneewind O. Mol.

If so, purification and biochemical analysis of this transpeptidation product may reveal the chemical bond that tethers BcpB to BcpA pili. To pursue this goal, we inserted an MH6 tag two residues upstream of the IPNTG sorting signal of BcpB within plasmid pJB202 (bcpALAVAA, srtD, bcpBMH6) (Fig. 5A). Asparagine 163 (YPKN163) of BcpA forms an intramolecular isopeptide bond that is dispensable for pilus assembly, as substitution of asparagine 163 with alanine abolished isopeptide bond formation without affecting pilus assembly (16Budzik J.M. Marraffini L.A. Souda P. Whitelegge J.P. Faull K.F. Schneewind O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 10215-10220Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). As expected, introduction of the bcpA N163A mutation in pJB213 (bcpAN163A, LAVAA, srtD, bcpBMH6) had no effect on the ability of sortase D to generate the transpeptidation product BcpBMH6-BcpALAVAA (Fig. 5, A and B). As a control, the His-horseradish peroxidase probe identified both BcpBMH6 precursor and BcpBMH6-BcpALAVAA in cell wall extracts from bacilli harboring pJB202 or pJB213 (Fig. 5B). Bacillus extracts containing BcpBMH6-BcpAN163A, LAVAA were subjected to affinity chromatography on Ni-NTA-Sepharose (Fig. 6A). The eluate was analyzed by Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE, which demonstrated purification of the BcpBMH6-BcpAN163A, LAVAA transpeptidation product (Fig. 6A). Eluted transpeptidation product was cut at methionyl residues with cyanogen bromide (CNBr), and cleavage products were subjected to a second round of Ni-NTA affinity chromatography (Fig. 6A). Eluted peptides were further purified by RP-HPLC with UV detection at 215 nm (Fig. 6A). At 20% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid, a peak of 15–20 milliabsorbance units was detected, and the compound was subjected to MALDI-mass spectrometry (Fig. 6, A and B). The predominant ion signal at 2764.68 m/z was identified as the branched peptide HHHHHHWVIPNT(YPKAEIKRGAM*) containing the tryptophan oxidation product hydroxytryptophan (calculated monoisotopic m/z 2764.41) (Fig. 6C). An additional cluster of peaks at 2782.69 m/z is thought to represent the branched peptide containing homoseryl instead of homoseryl lactone, methionyl reaction products that are acquired during CNBr cleavage (Fig. 6C) (16Budzik J.M. Marraffini L.A. Souda P. Whitelegge J.P. Faull K.F. Schneewind O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 10215-10220Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The ion signal at 2764.68 m/z was fragmented via collisionally activated dissociation, and fragment ion spectra confirmed the predicted structure of the branched peptide"
https://openalex.org/W2049268865,"The nonmuscle myosin IIA heavy chain (Myh9) is strongly associated with adhesion structures of osteoclasts. In this study, we demonstrate that during osteoclastogenesis, myosin IIA heavy chain levels are temporarily suppressed, an event that stimulates the onset of cell fusion. This suppression is not mediated by changes in mRNA or translational levels but instead is due to a temporary increase in the rate of myosin IIA degradation. Intracellular activity of cathepsin B is significantly enhanced at the onset of osteoclast precursor fusion, and specific inhibition of its activity prevents myosin IIA degradation. Further, treatment of normal cells with cathepsin B inhibitors during the differentiation process reduces cell fusion and bone resorption capacity, whereas overexpression of cathepsin B enhances fusion. Ongoing suppression of the myosin IIA heavy chain via RNA interference results in formation of large osteoclasts with significantly increased numbers of nuclei, whereas overexpression of myosin IIA results in less osteoclast fusion. Increased multinucleation caused by myosin IIA suppression does not require RANKL. Further, knockdown of myosin IIA enhances cell spreading and lessens motility. These data taken together strongly suggest that base-line expression of nonmuscle myosin IIA inhibits osteoclast precursor fusion and that a temporary, cathepsin B-mediated decrease in myosin IIA levels triggers precursor fusion during osteoclastogenesis.

The final stages of osteoclastogenesis involve fusion of differentiated precursors from the monocyte/macrophage lineage (1Teitelbaum S.L. Science. 2000; 289: 1504-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (3059) Google Scholar). Although the membrane structural components regulating preosteoclast fusion are not well understood, in recent years a number of candidate cell surface molecules have been implicated, including receptors CD44 (2Cui W.

A recently identified receptor, the dendritic cell-specific transmembrane protein, is essential for osteoclast fusion both in vitro and in vivo (9Kukita T. Wada N. Kukita A. Kakimoto T. Sandra F.

More recently, the d2 subunit of proton-translocating vacuolar proton-translocating ATPases, a membrane subunit isoform expressed predominantly in osteoclasts, similarly was demonstrated to be required for fusion in vitro and in vivo (11Lee S.H.

Although all class II molecules are composed of two heavy chains, two essential light chains, and two regulatory chains, their unique activities are a function of their particular heavy chain isoforms. Although the nonmuscle heavy chain isoforms share extensive structural homology, they have been shown to demonstrate distinct patterns of expression (15Kolega J. J.

In vitro, myosin IIA, a target of Rho kinase, has been shown to be involved in a wide variety of cellular functions, including cytokinesis, cell contractility, and adhesion and motility. The actin cytoskeleton of osteoclasts possesses features unlike those of most mammalian cell types. First, osteoclasts do not possess stress fibers but instead form a meshwork of fine actin filaments throughout the cell (27Akisaka T. Yoshida H. Inoue S. Shimizu K. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2001; 16: 1248-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 28Krits I. Wysolmerski R.B. Holliday L.S. Lee B.S. Calcif.

Res. 1988; 3: 389-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Osteoclasts express unusual attachment structures typified by the podosome, a form of adhesion structure most typically present in cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage, dendritic cells, and smooth muscle cells. Podosomes are integrin-based cell-matrix contact structures that are notable for the presence of a short (0.5–1.0 μm) F-actin core surrounded by a ring of adaptor proteins, kinases, small GTPases, and regulators of endocytosis (30Linder S. Kopp P. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 2079-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 31Jurdic P. Saltel F. Chabadel A. Destaing O. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 85: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). When cultured on glass, mature osteoclasts generate a belt of podosomes at the cell periphery. However, when cultured on bone, osteoclasts form a dense ring of podosome-like structures that is usually internal to the cell margins (32Luxenburg C. Geblinger D. Klein E. Anderson K. Hanein D. Geiger B. Addadi L. PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e179Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). This region, termed the sealing zone, surrounds a specialized membrane domain termed the ruffled border, from which protons and proteases are secreted to induce resorption of bone (1Teitelbaum S.L. Science. 2000; 289: 1504-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (3059) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that myosins IIA and IIB localize to distinct subcellular regions within osteoclasts, with MyoIIA 2The abbreviations used are: MyoIIA, myosin nonmuscle IIA heavy chain; RANKL, receptor activator of NF-κB ligand; RT-PCR, reverse transcription followed by PCR; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; catB, cathepsin B; siRNA, small interfering RNA. 2The abbreviations used are: MyoIIA, myosin nonmuscle IIA heavy chain; RANKL, receptor activator of NF-κB ligand; RT-PCR, reverse transcription followed by PCR; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; catB, cathepsin B; siRNA, small interfering RNA. strongly segregating to both podosomes and the actin ring of the sealing zone (28Krits I. Wysolmerski R.B. Holliday L.S. Lee B.S. Calcif. Tissue Int. 2002; 71: 530-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Because of this distribution into osteoclast adhesion structures and findings in other cells showing MyoIIA to be associated with dynamic Rho-kinase-dependent functions, such as adhesion and locomotion, we hypothesized that MyoIIA may play a vital role in cell motility and the bone resorption function. In this study, we examined cellular expression of MyoIIA during osteoclastogenesis and, along with RNA interference-mediated suppression of the protein, have confirmed its role in cell spreading, motility, and sealing zone formation. However, this study also unexpectedly revealed a role for MyoIIA in regulating preosteoclast fusion during osteoclastogenesis. Reagents and Cell Culture—Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against the MyoIIA heavy chain were previously generated (28Krits I. Wysolmerski R.B. Holliday L.S. Lee B.S. Calcif. Tissue Int. 2002; 71: 530-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) or were purchased from Sigma. Loading control antibodies to GAPDH and β-actin were purchased from Abcam. Protease inhibitors, excluding CA-074Me and CA-074, and an antibody to cathepsin B were purchased from EMD Biosciences. CA-074Me and CA-074 were obtained from Enzo Life Sciences/BioMol. Osteoclasts were generated either from RAW 264.7 macrophages (ATCC) or murine bone marrow, as previously described (28Krits I. Wysolmerski R.B. Holliday L.S. Lee B.S. Calcif.

Mature osteoclasts, as evidenced by a peripheral belt of podosomes (35Destaing O. Saltel F. Geminard J.C. Jurdic P. Bard F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 407-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar), were present by days 5–7 of culture. Resorption and motility assays were performed as previously described (34McMichael B.K.

Immunocytochemistry and Microscopy—Osteoclasts were cultured either on glass coverslips or thinly cut ivory slices. Cells were fixed and permeabilized, as previously described (28Krits I. Wysolmerski R.B. Holliday L.S. Lee B.S. Calcif. Tissue Int. 2002; 71: 530-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 33McMichael B.K. Kotadiya P. Singh T. Holliday L.S. Lee B.S.

Primary antibodies were added in a standard polyethylene glycol blocking buffer and were detected using Alexa-coupled secondary antibodies (Invitrogen). F-actin was labeled using Alexa-coupled phalloidin, also from Invitrogen. Nuclei were detected with bisbenzimide staining. Cells were visualized using either a Nikon 80i fluorescent microscope with SPOT camera software (Diagnostic Instruments) or a Zeiss 510 META laser-scanning confocal microscope (Campus Microscopy and Imaging Facility, The Ohio State University). Cell and sealing zone perimeters were measured using SigmaScan Pro 5.0 software (SPSS Science, Chicago, IL). Active cathepsin B was visualized using the Cathepsin B Magic Red real time detection kit (Immunochemistry Technologies, LLC, Bloomington, MN). The intensity of cathepsin B labeling was quantified using SigmaScan Pro 5.0 software. Competitive RT-PCR of Myh9 mRNA—Murine myosin IIA heavy chain (Myh9) expression was determined by competitive RT-PCR. The corresponding sense primer was of the sequence 5′-AGACCGCTGATGCTATGAACCG-3′, whereas the antisense primer was of the sequence 5′-ATGGTCAGAGCAGTCTCAAGGC-3′. An internal standard cDNA template for the reaction was generated as previously described (37Jeyaraj S. Dakhlallah D. Hill S.R. Lee B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 37957-37964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 38Lee B.S. Holliday L.S. Krits I. Gluck S.L. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 2127-2136Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This template was transcribed in vitro using the MAXIscript system (Ambion), and 10 pg of the resulting RNA was added to 1 μg of osteoclast total cellular RNA prior to reverse transcription and PCR. These reactions were performed using the Superscript first strand synthesis system and Taq DNA polymerase, both from Invitrogen. The resulting RT-PCR products were run in a 2% gel and stained with ethidium bromide to visualize relative intensities of the bands, which were measured using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Western Analysis—For Western analysis, osteoclast lysates were harvested with M-PER reagent (Pierce) and were run in precast polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad) and transferred to Hybond membrane (GE HealthCare). Primary antibodies were allowed to bind to the membranes using standard methodology and were detected using horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies coupled with SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent reagents (Pierce). Pulse-Chase Analysis—Osteoclasts on days 0, 3, and 7 of differentiation were labeled for 2 h in methionine- and cysteine-free medium supplemented with 45 μCi/ml Tran35S-label (MP Biomedicals). The cells were then incubated in complete medium for various times before immunoprecipitation, performed as previously described (39Lee B.S. Gluck S.L. Holliday L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29164-29171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The precipitates were run in SDS-PAGE, and the gel was subsequently treated with Fluoro-Hance (Research Products International) and exposed to film. Quantity One software was used to quantify the intensity of the myosin IIA immunoprecipitate bands. Knockdown and Overexpression of MyoIIA—siRNA oligonucleotides were designed and synthesized by Ambion. siRNA1, which was used for all relevant experiments, was of the sequence 5′-GGCUGAUUUCUGCAUUAUCtt-3′ (sense) and 5′-GAUAAUGCAGAAAUCAGCCtt-3′ (antisense). siRNA2, used to confirm many of the results, was of the sequence 5′-GGUGAACAAGGACGACAUCtt-3′ (sense) and 5′-GAUGUCGUCCUUGUUCACCtt-3′ (antisense). These siRNAs showed identity to no other myosin isoform or murine transcript. For all experiments, a nontargeting double-stranded RNA from Ambion was used as a negative control (C0), although siRNAs homologous to siRNA1 and siRNA2 but containing point mutations also were used for confirmation. The mutant siRNA1 (C1) was of the sequence 5′-GGCUGAUcagUGCAUUAUCtt-3′ (sense) and 5′-GAUAAUGCAcugAUCAGCCtt-3′ (antisense), whereas the mutant siRNA2 (C2) was of the sequence 5′-GGUGAACAcacACGACAUCtt-3′ (sense) and 5′-GAUGUCGUgugUGUUCACCtt-3′ (antisense). RAW264.7- and marrow-derived osteoclasts were transfected on day 4 of culture using 25–50 nm targeting or control siRNA. RAW264.7 cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), and marrow-derived osteoclasts were transfected via electroporation, as previously described. Osteoclasts were transfected by these methods with >95% efficiency (34McMichael B.K. Lee B.S. Exp. Cell Res. 2008; 314: 564-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 36Kotadiya P. McMichael B.K. Lee B.S. Bone. 2008; 43: 951-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In other experiments, a human myosin IIA cDNA in the pEGFP-C3 vector (40Wei Q. Adelstein R.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3617-3627Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) or the empty vector (Clontech) was transiently transfected into RAW264.7 cells on day 3 of RANKL treatment and assayed for cell perimeter and nuclear number on day 5. Transfection was performed by electroporation at 250 V/250 microfarads, and efficiency was >90%. Overexpression of Cathepsin B—A murine cDNA clone of cathepsin B was obtained by RT-PCR from RAW264.7 cells and was subcloned into the pEF6/V5-His expression vector (Invitrogen). Following transfection of this construct into RAW264.7 macrophages, selection for stable transfectants was performed by selection with 3 μg/ml blasticidin. Two overexpressing clones were chosen for analysis. Statistical Analysis—Pairwise comparisons of samples were performed using Student's t test. Linear regression was used to model the relationship between cell or sealing zone perimeter and the number of nuclei, allowing for different slope and intercept terms for each cell type, and was performed by the Center for Biostatistics (Ohio State University). In order to satisfy the assumptions of normality and constant variance, the data were modeled on the log scale. F-tests were used to determine the significance of type-specific slope and intercept parameters. Statistical comparison was deemed significant at p < 0.05. Myosin IIA Distribution in Osteoclasts—We previously showed that nonmuscle myosin IIA, but not IIB, was associated with podosomes and the actin ring of polarized osteoclasts (28Krits I. Wysolmerski R.B. Holliday L.S. Lee B.S. Calcif. Tissue Int. 2002; 71: 530-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). More detailed examination of these structures demonstrates that MyoIIA is distributed in the cloud of actin surrounding the podosome core but not the core itself. Fig. 1A illustrates immunocytochemistry of MyoIIA surrounding F-actin cores of podosomes (arrowheads). Additionally, detailed examination of the sealing zone of polarized osteoclasts showed that MyoIIA is distributed over the inner face of the actin ring (Fig. 1B, arrowheads). These results, demonstrating a strong presence of MyoIIA in adhesion structures, suggest a role in osteoclast motility and/or bone resorption. Myosin IIA Expression Is Transiently Decreased during Osteoclastogenesis—Two culture models of murine osteoclastogenesis are widely used to study this process. Mouse bone marrow precursors or the mouse macrophage cell line RAW264.7, when stimulated to differentiate with a soluble form of RANKL, can form mature osteoclasts over the course of 5–7 days in culture. Dividing precursors cease mitosis and initiate fusion after about 3 days, continuing to become more extensively multinucleated as long as fusion partners are in close proximity (41Takahashi N. Udagawa N. Tanaka S. Murakami H. Owan I. Tamura T. Suda T. Dev. Biol. 1994; 163: 212-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 42Tanaka S. Takahashi N. Udagawa N. Tamura T. Akatsu T. Stanley E.R. Kurokawa T. Suda T. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). As a first step in examining the role of MyoIIA in osteoclast function, precursor cells were differentiated in the presence of RANKL over a 7-day culture period. Western blots demonstrated that differentiating osteoclasts temporarily decreased their cellular levels of the MyoIIA heavy chain during the middle of this differentiation period, corresponding to the time when precursor cells cease mitosis and begin to fuse (41Takahashi N. Udagawa N. Tanaka S. Murakami H. Owan I. Tamura T. Suda T. Dev. Biol. 1994; 163: 212-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 42Tanaka S. Takahashi N. Udagawa N. Tamura T. Akatsu T. Stanley E.R. Kurokawa T. Suda T. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Fig. 2A shows representative Western blots of this process in RAW264.7 cells, whereas the graph in Fig. 2B shows quantitation of three such experiments each for RAW264.7 cells and mouse marrow precursors. In both cases, MyoIIA levels decreased by about half by day 4 of culture and returned to baseline levels by day 7. In contrast, levels of β-actin and the housekeeping protein GAPDH remained constant (Fig. 2A). Additionally, expression levels of the MyoIIB isoform were unchanged over the same period (data not shown). To determine the mechanism behind this transient decrease, MyoIIA heavy chain mRNA levels were assayed by competitive RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 2C, mRNA remained steady during the differentiation period, indicating that the temporary loss of MyoIIA resulted from a translational or post-translational mechanism. To further define this mechanism, pulse-chase analysis was performed on differentiating RAW 264.7 cells at days 0, 3, and 7 of culture to determine MyoIIA heavy chain half-life. Fig. 2D shows that although day 0 and day 7 cells exhibited only a 10–20% loss of MyoIIA after 9 h of chase, the day 3 cells lost ∼70% of their labeled MyoIIA over the same time period. These results demonstrate that the temporary decrease in MyoIIA expression during mid-osteoclastogenesis is due to increased degradation of the protein. Cathepsin B Regulates Myosin IIA Levels and Osteoclast Fusion—Differentiating osteoclasts were tested with a panel of specific protease inhibitors to identify the class of enzyme responsible for the transient decrease in MyoIIA expression. RAW264.7 cells on day 3 of culture were treated with a panel of these compounds for 6 h. The proteasomal inhibitors MG132 and ZLLF did not suppress MyoIIA degradation; nor did the cysteine protease inhibitor E64 (Fig. 3A) or the specific calpain inhibitor calpeptin (data not shown). A single nonspecific inhibitor of cysteine proteases, ALLM, produced a slight suppression of degradation. However, because ALLM is established as having a degree of reactivity with cathepsins B and L, cathepsin inhibitor I (which inhibits B and, to a lesser extent, L) also was tested on differentiating osteoclasts. Cells treated with cathepsin inhibitor I expressed MyoIIA at levels greater than that of control cells or cells undergoing any other treatment. These data indicate a role for cathepsin B (catB) in promoting MyoIIA degradation. To explore this finding further, differentiating osteoclasts were treated with either CA-074 or CA-074Me, specific inhibitors of cathepsin B. Although CA-074 is mostly impermeant to cell membranes, CA-074Me is modified with a cleavable methyl ester that allows cell entry. As shown in Fig. 3A, treatment with CA-074Me, but not CA-074, strongly increased MyoIIA levels, demonstrating further that MyoIIA degradation is promoted by intracellular cathepsin B. Previous studies (43Blair H.C. Sidonio R.F. Friedberg R.C. Khan N.N. Dong S.S. J. Cell Biochem. 2000; 78: 627-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) have demonstrated increasing levels of both catB protein and activity in lysates from differentiating human osteoclast precursors. We confirmed and extended these studies by taking advantage of a commercially available cell-permeant cathepsin B substrate that fluoresces upon cleavage, allowing visual identification of active catB within live cells. Examination of osteoclasts at varying stages of maturation demonstrated a distinct rise in active catB levels when osteoclast precursors shifted from a mononucleated to multinucleated stage. Fig. 3B, left, shows an example of day 3 osteoclast cultures containing a mixture of mononuclear (open arrows) and multinuclear (closed arrowhead) cells. Multinucleated cells demonstrated intense active catB labeling. Quantification of staining intensity in day 3 cultures revealed a clear rise in active enzyme levels as preosteoclasts underwent multinucleation (Fig. 3B, right). This rise in activity temporally correlates with the loss of MyoIIA expression demonstrated in Fig. 2A. To determine whether inhibition of cathepsin B activity had any effect on osteoclast formation, cathepsin B inhibitors were added to day 3 preosteoclasts, and the resulting cells were examined the next day. Fig. 3C, left, illustrates that the addition of cathepsin inhibitor I produced a significant decrease in multinucleation, relative to vehicle-only controls. Similar results were obtained when CA-074Me, but not CA-074, was added to cultures (Fig. 3C, right). These results demonstrate that inhibitors of intracellular cathepsin B suppress osteoclast fusion. Further, to determine the effects of catB gain of function, a murine cDNA clone was isolated by RT-PCR and overexpressed in RAW264.7 macrophages (Fig. 3D, left). Upon differentiation into mature osteoclasts, catB-overexpressing cells demonstrated an 84% increase in nuclear number, with a similar accompanying increase in cell perimeter (Fig. 3D, right). These results suggest that cathepsin B activity has an effect on osteoclast fusion by promoting proteolysis of MyoIIA. RNA Interference-mediated Suppression of Myosin IIA—The results above suggest that modulation of MyoIIA levels plays a key role in osteoclastogenesis. To test the role of MyoIIA more directly, RNA interference was used to knock down MyoIIA expression in the latter half (day 4 onward) of the osteoclast differentiation process, thus preventing recovery of its expression levels after the normal transient decrease. Two siRNAs specific to the MyoIIA heavy chain were designed and tested for efficacy in both RAW264.7 and mouse marrow cells, as were three control double-stranded oligonucleotides. Cells were transfected on day 4 of culture and assayed for MyoIIA mRNA and protein levels 2 and 3 days later, respectively. Fig. 4A (top) demonstrates that both targeting siRNAs diminished levels of MyoIIA mRNA, whereas the three control double-stranded RNA oligonucleotides (C0–C2) had no effect. The lower panels of Fig. 4A confirm a significant loss of MyoIIA protein after siRNA treatment, whereas cellular GAPDH and β-actin levels remained constant. The remaining panels of Fig. 4 illustrate the time course of diminished MyoIIA expression achieved with siRNA1. Notable decreases in MyoIIA mRNA were evident as early as 1 day post-transfection (Fig. 4B), with suppressed protein levels evident 1 day later (Fig. 4C). GAPDH and β-actin levels were unaffected over the length of the time course. Quantitation of multiple experiments with siRNA1 showed MyoIIA protein to drop to ∼60%"
https://openalex.org/W2035979786,"In the mammalian hippocampus, changes in the expression of immediate early genes (IEGs) is thought to contribute to long term plastic changes in neurons brought about by learning tasks and high frequency stimulation of synapses. The phosphatase calcineurin has emerged as an important negative regulator of hippocampus-dependent learning and long term potentiation. Here we investigated the possibility that the constraining action of calcineurin on hippocampal plasticity is mediated in part by regulation of gene expression through negative control of transcription factors, such as cAMP-response element (CRE)-binding protein (CREB). We assessed the effect of calcineurin inhibitors on CREB activation by neuronal activity and show that calcineurin activity is in fact required for CREB-mediated gene expression. However, inhibition of calcineurin had disparate effects on the transcriptional induction of CREB-dependent IEGs. We find that the IEG c-fos is unaffected by suppression of calcineurin activity, the plasticity-related genes Egr1/Zif268 and Egr2/Krox-20 are up-regulated, and genes encoding the orphan nuclear hormone receptors Nor1 and Nur77 are down-regulated. We further show that the up-regulation of particular IEGs is probably due to the presence of serum response elements (SREs) in their promoters, because SRE-mediated gene expression is enhanced by calcineurin blockers. Moreover, expression of the c-fos gene, which is unaffected by calcineurin inhibitors, could be down-regulated by mutating the SRE. Conversely, SRE-mediated c-fos induction in the absence of a functional CRE was enhanced by calcineurin inhibitors. Our experiments thus implicate calcineurin as a negative regulator of SRE-dependent neuronal genes."

We showed previously that versican, which is overexpressed in cutaneous melanomas as well as in premalignant lesions, contributes to melanoma progression, favoring the detachment of cells and the metastatic dissemination. Here, we investigated the transcriptional regulation of the versican promoter in melanoma cell lines with different levels of biological aggressiveness and stages of differentiation. We show that versican promoter up-regulation accounts for the differential expression levels of mRNA and protein detected in the invasive SK-mel-131 human melanoma cells. The activity of the versican promoter increased 5-fold in these cells in comparison with that measured in non-invasive MeWo melanoma cells. Several transcriptional regulatory elements were identified in the proximal promoter, including AP-1, Sp1, AP-2, and two TCF-4 sites. We show that promoter activation is mediated by the ERK/MAPK and JNK signaling pathways acting on the AP-1 site, suggesting that BRAF mutation present in SK-mel-131 cells impinge upon the up-regulation of the versican gene through signaling elicited by the ERK/MAPK pathway. This is the first time the AP-1 transcription factor family has been shown to be related to the regulation of versican expression. Furthermore, deletion of the TCF-4 binding sites caused a 60% decrease in the promoter activity in SK-mel-131 cells. These results showing that AP-1 and TCF-4 binding sites are the main regulatory regions directing versican production provide new insights into versican promoter regulation during melanoma progression."
https://openalex.org/W2119127513,"Mitotic microtubule (MT)-targeting drugs are widely used to treat cancer. The GTPase Ran regulates multiple processes, including mitotic spindle assembly, spindle pole formation and MT dynamics; Ran activity is therefore essential to formation of a functional mitotic apparatus. The RanBP1 protein, which binds Ran and regulates its interaction with effectors, is overexpressed in many cancer types. Several observations indicate that RanBP1 contributes to regulate the function of the mitotic apparatus: RanBP1 inactivation yields hyperstable MTs and induces apoptosis during mitosis, reminiscent of the effects of the MT-stabilizing drug taxol. Here we have investigated the influence of RanBP1 on spontaneous and taxol-induced apoptosis in transformed cells. We report that RanBP1 downregulation by RNA interference activates apoptosis in several transformed cell lines regardless of their p53 status, but not in the caspase-3-defective MCF-7 breast cancer cell line. Furthermore, RanBP1-interfered cells show an increased apoptotic response to taxol compared to their counterpart with normal or high RanBP1 levels, and this response is caspase-3 dependent. These results indicate that RanBP1 can modulate the outcome of MT-targeting therapeutic protocols."
https://openalex.org/W1995847448,"Ryk is a Wnt receptor that plays an important role in neurogenesis, neurite outgrowth, and axon guidance. We have reported that the Ryk receptor is cleaved by gamma-secretase and that its intracellular domain (ICD) translocates to the nucleus upon Wnt stimulation. Cleavage of Ryk and its ICD is important for the function of Ryk in neurogenesis. However, the question of how the Ryk ICD is stabilized and translocated into the nucleus remains unanswered. Here, we show that the Ryk ICD undergoes ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. We have identified Cdc37, a subunit of the molecular chaperone Hsp90 complex, as a Ryk ICD-interacting protein that inhibits proteasomal degradation of the Ryk ICD. Overexpression of Cdc37 increases Ryk ICD levels and promotes its nuclear localization, whereas Cdc37 knockdown reduces Ryk ICD stability. Furthermore, we have discovered that the Cdc37-Ryk ICD complex is disrupted during neural differentiation of embryonic stem cells, resulting in Ryk ICD degradation. These results suggest that Cdc37 plays an essential role in regulating Ryk ICD stability and therefore in Ryk-mediated signal transduction."

Cluster removal from c-acon is thought to include oxidative demetallation as a required step, but little else is understood about the process of conversion to IRP1.

IRP1 dictates mRNA fate by binding to iron-responsive elements (IREs) in at least six mRNA encoding key proteins that directly control the uptake and metabolic fate of iron. Excess iron promotes inactivation of IRP1 RNA binding through two mechanisms. The first involves insertion of a [4Fe-4S] cluster converting IRP1 to the cytosolic isoform of aconitase (c-acon), the so-called iron-sulfur switch. A second mechanism relies on iron-mediated degradation of the IRP1 apoprotein (1Muckenthaler M.U. Galy B. Hentze M.W. Annu. Rev.

This is particularly relevant to c-acon/IRP1 because the c-acon form can be up to 100-fold more abundant than the IRP1 RNA-binding form (6Chen O.S. Schalinske K.L. Eisenstein R.S. J.

Generation of IRE RNA binding activity from c-acon requires complete removal of the iron-sulfur cluster along with reduction of critical Cys (8Haile D.J. Rouault T.A. Harford J.B. Kennedy M.C.

The generally held view is that iron-sulfur cluster loss from c-acon is not kinetically feasible in response to iron deficiency without the action of agents that directly promote this process (9Beinert H. Kennedy M.C. Stout C.D. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2335-2374Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Studies to date have focused on the role of cluster perturbants such as reactive oxygen and nitrogen species in promoting cluster removal (2Wallander M.L. Leibold E.A. Eisenstein R.S. Biochim.

Chem. 1997; 272: 20340-20347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Although both solvent accessibility of the iron-sulfur cluster in aconitases and the lack of direct ligation of the fourth iron of the cluster (Fea) to a protein moiety facilitates cluster removal by perturbants, many questions remain concerning this process (12Meyron-Holtz E.G. Ghosh M.C. Rouault T.A. Science. 2004; 306: 2087-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 18Eisenstein R.S. Kennedy M.C. Beinert H. Silver S. Walden W. Metal Ions in Gene Regulation. Chapman & Hall, New York1998: 157-216Crossref Google Scholar). For example, it is not clear whether perturbant action is required for generation of RNA binding activity. It is notable that members of the aconitase family differ substantially with respect to the stability of their iron-sulfur cluster, ranging from the spontaneous instability observed in Escherichia coli aconitase B (AcnB) to mammalian c-acon, which appears to have one of the most stable iron-sulfur clusters in this protein family (19Varghese S. Tang Y. Imlay J.A. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 20Walden W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Although the relative stability of c-acon may limit maladaptive responses to cluster perturbants, it raises questions concerning the efficacy of the iron-sulfur switch in controlling IRP1 function. Consequently, a mechanism to enhance the sensitivity of the iron-sulfur cluster in a pool of c-acon to perturbants could provide a key physiological means for generating IRE binding activity while limiting its potential pathological impact. Previous studies suggest that Ser138 phosphorylation of IRP1 provides a mechanism to control the stability of the iron-sulfur cluster in c-acon and to alter the set point for iron regulation of IRP1 (4Clarke S.L.

First, Ser138 phosphomimetic mutants of IRP1 (IRP1S138D and IRP1S138E) can assemble a [4Fe-4S] cluster and exhibit aconitase activity as the purified protein or when supporting aconitase-dependent growth in yeast in vivo. In both cases the iron-sulfur cluster displayed markedly increased sensitivity to oxygen or reactive oxygen species and altered accumulation of a likely intermediate in the conversion of c-acon to IRP1 (10Brown N.M. Anderson S.A. Steffen D.W. Carpenter T.B. Kennedy M.C. Walden W.E. Eisenstein R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15235-15240Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 21Brown N.M.

Second, the capacity of both IRP1S138D and IRP1S138E to support aconitase-dependent growth in yeast was more sensitive to iron depletion than that of IRP1WT, implying that the phosphomimetic mutants exhibit increased rates of cluster removal in vivo (21Brown N.M.

Third, in mammalian cells Ser138 phosphomimetic mutants fail to accumulate as c-acon (4Clarke S.L. Vasanthakumar A. Anderson S.A. Pondarre C. Koh C.M. Deck K.M. Pitula J.S. Epstein C.J.

Biol. 2003; 23: 6973-6981Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), suggesting that enhanced cluster disassembly alters the balance between c-acon and IRP1. Taken together, these studies indicate that the Ser138 phosphomimetic mutants would be useful tools for further elucidating the mechanisms responsible for the conversion of c-acon to IRP1. In this study we have investigated the impact of cluster perturbants and iron chelators on the capacity for cluster-dependent regulation of Ser138 phosphomimetic mutants of IRP1. In vitro cluster reconstitution studies revealed that IRP1S138E exhibits reciprocal regulation of RNA binding and aconitase activities but with markedly greater sensitivity to NO. Interestingly, c-aconS138E was strongly inhibited by iron chelators that were without effect on c-aconWT. Following anaerobic incubation with EDTA, conversion of c-aconS138E from the [4Fe-4S] to a [3Fe-4S] form was detected, suggesting enhanced 4Fe-to-3Fe cycling and spontaneous nonoxidative demetallation of the iron-sulfur cluster in the Ser138 phosphomimetic mutant. Our results support a model wherein Ser138 phosphorylation allows for regulation of IRP1 via the iron-sulfur switch mechanism in a manner that enhances responsiveness to changes of intracellular iron status or oxidative/nitrosative stress while preventing potentially lethal overaccumulation of IRP1 through iron-mediated degradation of the protein.

A. 1992; 89: 11730-11734Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Control reactions lacking iron yielded no aconitase activity. Nitric Oxide and EDTA Treatments of Reconstituted c-acon—In an anaerobic chamber varying concentrations of the NO source diethylamine NONOate (DEANO, stabilized in pH 8.7 TAPS buffer or 0.01 n NaOH at 4 °C) were diluted into a solution of c-acon (5–6 units/ml aconitase, in 90 mm Hepes, 10% glycerol, pH 7.5). Upon dilution into pH 7.5 Hepes buffer at 25 °C, DEANO decays to produce NO (measured t½ = 10–12 min). As a control the aconitase activity of the protein solution in the absence of DEANO was monitored concurrently. For EDTA experiments c-aconWT or c-aconS138E was diluted to an enzymatic activity of 3–6 units/ml, and EDTA or buffer control was added. After anaerobic incubation with EDTA, aconitase activity was measured. Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy—X-band EPR spectra were obtained at liquid helium temperatures on a Bruker E500 ELEXYS spectrometer with 100-kHz field modulation, equipped with an Oxford Instrument ESR-9 helium flow cryostat and a DM-0101 cavity. RNA Binding Activity—For purified IRP1 and iron-sulfur cluster-reconstituted c-acon, the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) method was performed as described except that EDTA was omitted from the gel and the running buffer because of its reactivity with IRP1S138E (27Schalinske K.L. Eisenstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7168-7176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Binding reactions between IRP1/c-acon and [32P]RNA (l-ferritin 73-nucleotide mRNA fragment containing IRE) were set up, incubated anaerobically, and loaded onto the gel outside the anaerobic chamber. Filter binding assays were performed as described (28Barton H.A. Eisenstein R.S. Bomford A. Munro H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7000-7008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using 25-mm nitrocellulose filters (Protran BA 85, Whatman/Schleicher & Schuell) except that all steps were carried out in the anaerobic chamber. Briefly, the protein samples were diluted into binding buffer containing a 5–10-fold molar excess of radiolabeled IRE and incubated for 10 min on ice before passing through a nitrocellulose filter. The filter was washed once with fresh binding buffer. The filter and the flow-through/wash were collected in separate scintillation vials and counted. For extracts of HEK 293 cells an RNA binding supershift assay was performed (4Clarke S.L. Vasanthakumar A. Anderson S.A. Pondarre C. Koh C.M. Deck K.M. Pitula J.S. Epstein C.J. Fleming M.D. Eisenstein R.S. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 544-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The lysates were anaerobically incubated in binding buffer with 1 μg of anti-Myc antibody for 2 h at 4 °C. [32P]RNA (final concentration, 2 nm) was added and incubated for 10 min. After the addition of heparin (0.5 mg/ml final), the reactions were loaded onto a 8% polyacrylamide gel prepared in Tris borate buffer, pH 8.0, lacking EDTA and run at 4 °C to separate free, proteinbound (endogenous IRP1 and IRP2) and supershifted (IRP1 antibody-bound) RNA. Mammalian Cell Culture—HEK 293 cells expressing Myc-tagged IRP1WT or Myc-tagged IRP1S138E were plated at 0.5–1.0 × 106/ml, induced with tetracycline (+tet) or not (–tet) for 36 h under hypoxia (1% O2/5% CO2/94% N2) or under normoxia (normal incubator conditions), and harvested anaerobically in phosphate-buffered saline with 1 mm citrate (4Clarke S.L. Vasanthakumar A. Anderson S.A. Pondarre C. Koh C.M. Deck K.M. Pitula J.S. Epstein C.J. Fleming M.D. Eisenstein R.S. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 544-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The cells were lysed inside the anaerobic chamber in four volumes of lysis buffer (LB, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm citrate, and protease inhibitor mixture as described (4Clarke S.L. Vasanthakumar A. Anderson S.A. Pondarre C. Koh C.M. Deck K.M. Pitula J.S. Epstein C.J. Fleming M.D. Eisenstein R.S. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 544-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) but omitting EDTA). After centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min using O-ring-sealed tubes, the clarified lysate was assayed for aconitase activity within 2 h of lysis. Protein content was determined by the BCA assay. To calculate aconitase activity caused by recombinant protein, the endogenous (–tet) aconitase activity was subtracted from the (+tet) aconitase activity. Tet treatment had no impact on aconitase activity in nontransfected cells. 4S. L. Clarke and K. M. Deck, unpublished results. Immunoblot analysis confirmed the induction of Myc-IRP1 in lysates of tet-induced cells, and no Myc-IRP1 was detected in lysates from uninduced cells. A Ser138 Phosphomimetic Mutant of IRP1 Is Regulated by the Iron-Sulfur Switch in Vitro—Previous studies had suggested that Ser138 phosphorylation might completely uncouple IRP1 from the iron-sulfur switch mechanism, allowing for its regulation only through iron-mediated protein degradation (22Fillebeen C. Chahine D. Caltagirone A. Segal P. Pantopoulos K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6973-6981Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, we reasoned that although the iron-sulfur cluster in Ser138 phosphomimetic mutants of c-acon is extremely sensitive to disruption, they would still be regulated by the iron-sulfur switch mechanism depending on the level of cluster perturbants present. Thus, these mutants could serve as useful models allowing further elucidation of the process(es) of cluster disassembly. An important premise for this hypothesis is that Ser138 phosphomutants of IRP1 should be able to undergo the traditional iron-sulfur switch mechanism in vitro and exhibit a reciprocal relationship between RNA binding and aconitase activities (8Haile D.J. Rouault T.A. Harford J.B. Kennedy M.C. Blondin G.A. Beinert H. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11735-11739Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 29Haile D.J. Rouault T.A. Tang C.K. Chin J. Harford J.B. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7536-7540Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). To test this, we used IRP1S138E because it displays the strongest instability phenotype. In the following sections cluster-containing IRP1 is referred to as c-acon. After anaerobic iron-sulfur cluster reconstitution, the IRP1WT and IRP1S138E displayed substantial aconitase activity (Fig. 1A). No aconitase activity was observed for either protein in the absence of reconstitution (data not shown). The impact of cluster reconstitution on RNA binding activity was determined by EMSA (Fig. 1, B and C). RNA binding activity of IRP1WT and IRP1S138E was decreased by 81 and 53%, respectively, after cluster reconstitution. Previous studies have shown that treatment of c-acon with 2% 2-mercaptoethanol allows c-acon to bind RNA, permitting determination of the total amount of RNA binding activity in a mixture of IRP1 and c-acon (30Hentze M.W. Rouault T.A. Harford J.B. Klausner R.D. Science. 1989; 244: 357-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). As expected total 2-mercaptoethanol-induced RNA binding activity of IRP1WT and IRP1S138E was unaffected by reconstitution (Fig. 1C). Hence, under anaerobic conditions the classical iron-sulfur switch can operate in vitro in IRP1S138E over a similar range as observed for IRP1WT. Altered Set Point for Regulation of RNA Binding and Aconitase Activity in Ser138 Phosphomimetic Mutants—We then asked whether the set point for regulation of the iron-sulfur switch by NO, an established cluster perturbant (16Soum E. Drapier J.C. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2003; 8: 226-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 17Kennedy M.C. Antholine W.E. Beinert H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20340-20347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 31Cairo G. Ronchi R. Recalcati S. Campanella A. Minotti G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7435-7442Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), was altered in Ser138 phosphomimetic mutants. We first compared the NO sensitivity of the iron-sulfur cluster in c-aconWT and the control, c-aconS138A, with that in the phosphomimetic mutants c-aconS138E and c-aconS138D. The NO generator DEANO was used. In the presence of a 200-fold molar excess of DEANO, c-aconWT and c-aconS138A were stable, with more than 90% of aconitase activity being retained over the 80-min experiment (Fig. 2A). From these results the half-life of active aconitase enzyme for c-aconWT and c-aconS138A was estimated to be greater than 10 h. In contrast, the Ser138 phosphomimetic mutants c-aconS138D and c-aconS138E displayed greatly enhanced sensitivity to NO. The half-lives of enzymatically active c-aconS138D and c-aconS138E were 7 and 2 min, respectively, 2 orders of magnitude shorter than for IRP1WT (Fig. 2A). Based on the striking differences in half-lives of the iron-sulfur cluster in c-aconS138D and c-aconS138E compared with c-aconWT after exposure to NO, a more thorough characterization of the instability was desired. Hence, the dose dependence of the DEANO effect was determined. A 50% loss of aconitase activity in c-aconWT required a ratio of DEANO to c-aconWT of 220:1. In contrast, only a 36:1 ratio was required to achieve the same percentage loss of activity in c-aconS138D and only a 7:1 ratio for c-aconS138E (Fig. 2B). We conclude that on a dosage basis, the phosphomimetic mutants are 6–30-fold more sensitive to the cluster perturbant NO than is WT. Given the greater sensitivity to NO-dependent cluster disassembly in the Ser138 phosphomimetic mutants of c-acon, we asked whether this translated into enhanced generation of RNA binding activity at low NO concentration. A strictly anaerobic filter binding assay was used to determine RNA binding activity. RNA binding activity of IRP1WT was maximally increased by 4-fold at 1.0 mm DEANO (Fig. 2C). The RNA binding activity of IRP1S138E was maximally increased 2-fold in the presence of 0.1 mm DEANO, a 10-fold lower concentration than observed for c-aconWT (Fig. 2D). The observation that aconitase activity declined more than the RNA binding activity increased for both IRP1WT and IRP1S138E likely indicates the presence of additional forms of IRP1/c-acon not active in RNA binding or aconitase activity (16Soum E. Drapier J.C. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2003; 8: 226-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 17Kennedy M.C. Antholine W.E. Beinert H. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7435-7442Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In HEK Cells IRP1S138E Displays an Altered Response to Hypoxia and Nitric Oxide—Because the experiments with purified protein demonstrated that IRP1S138E can be regulated by the iron-sulfur switch and that the set point for this regulation is altered, we further probed the effect of enhanced iron-sulfur cluster disassembly on the function and regulation of IRP1. To accomplish this we determined the impact of hypoxia versus normoxia on IRP1, c-acon, and related species for IRP1WT and IRP1S138E expressed in HEK cells. It has been shown that hypoxia generally causes a shift of IRP1 to the aconitase form with a decrease in RNA binding activity in several cell lines, although the impact of hypoxia on IRP1 may depend on cell type (12Meyron-Holtz E.G. Ghosh M.C. Rouault T.A. Science. 2004; 306: 2087-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 32Hanson E.S. Leibold E.A. J. Biol.

This decrease in RNA binding activity is in contrast to IRP2, which is stabilized in hypoxia, increasing its RNA binding activity (35Hanson E.S. Foot L.M. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5047-5052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Using activity assays and immunoblots, we determined the impact of oxygen tension on the abundance of the RNA-binding, aconitase, and inactive forms of IRP1 in HEK cells expressing IRP1WT and IRP1S138E from a tetracycline-inducible promoter. Finally, we determined whether the c-aconS138E generated in cells recapitulated the NO sensitivity phenotype observed with in vitro reconstituted protein. HEK 293 cells were exposed to normoxia or to hypoxia (1% O2) for 36 h with or without tet. The aconitase activity attributable to the IRP1WT or IRP1S138E transgenes was determined by subtracting the activity obtained in the absence of tet (endogenous cellular activity) from the total activity obtained in the presence of tet (endogenous plus tet-induced activity).

The GLTP fold is conformationally unique among lipid binding/transfer proteins and serves as the prototype and founding member of the new GLTP superfamily. In the present study, changes in human GLTP tryptophan fluorescence, induced by membrane vesicles containing glycolipid, are shown to reflect glycolipid binding when vesicle concentrations are low. Characterization of the glycolipid-induced “signature response,” i.e. ∼40% decrease in Trp intensity and ∼12-nm blue shift in emission wavelength maximum, involved various modes of glycolipid presentation, i.e. microinjection/dilution of lipid-ethanol solutions or phosphatidylcholine vesicles, prepared by sonication or extrusion and containing embedded glycolipids. High resolution x-ray structures of apo- and holo-GLTP indicate that major conformational alterations are not responsible for the glycolipid-induced GLTP signature response. Instead, glycolipid binding alters the local environment of Trp-96, which accounts for ∼70% of total emission intensity of three Trp residues in GLTP and provides a stacking platform that aids formation of a hydrogen bond network with the ceramide-linked sugar of the glycolipid headgroup. The changes in Trp signal were used to quantitatively assess human GLTP binding affinity for various lipids including glycolipids containing different sugar headgroups and homogenous acyl chains.

GLTP employs a novel two-layer “sandwich motif,” dominated by α-helices and achieved without intramolecular disulfide bridges, to accommodate glycolipid within a single lipid binding site and to form a membrane-interaction domain that differs from other known membrane targeting/translocation domains, i.e. C1, C2, PH, PX, and FYVE (9Brown R.E.

The glycolipid binding site of GLTP consists of a sugar headgroup recognition center that anchors the ceramide-linked sugar to the protein surface via multiple hydrogen bonds and a hydrophobic tunnel that accommodates the hydrocarbon chains of ceramide. The crystal structures of glycolipid-free GLTP and of GLTP complexed with a half-dozen glycolipids differing in sugar headgroup and/or lipid acyl composition reveal the basis for specific recognition and adaptive accommodation of various GSLs. A conserved, concerted sequence of events, initiated by anchoring of the GSL headgroup to the sugar headgroup recognition center, seems to facilitate entry and exit of the lipid chains in the membrane-associated state (13Malinina L. Malakhova M.L. Kanak A.T. Lu M. Abagyan R. Brown R.E. Patel D.J. PLoS Biol. 2006; 4: e362Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Glycolipid uptake occurs via a cleft-like gating mechanism involving conformational changes to one α-helix and two interhelical loops (12Malinina L. Malakhova M.L. Teplov A. Brown R.E. Patel D.J. Nature. 2004; 430: 1048-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The selectivity of GLTP for glycolipids makes this protein a prime candidate for molecular manipulation of GSL-enriched microdomains in membranes as well as a potential vehicle for selectively delivering glycolipids to cells. However, the binding affinity of various glycolipids for GLTP and the time frame of GSL uptake by GLTP remain unclear. In the present study, these issues are investigated using fluorescence approaches. GLTP is intrinsically fluorescent by virtue of having 3 Trp and 10 Tyr residues among its 209 amino acids. All 3 Trp residues reside on or near the surface of GLTP (12Malinina L. Malakhova M.L. Teplov A. Brown R.E. Patel D.J.

Given the likely roles in membrane interaction and GSL binding, our goal was to define the relative contributions of the Trp fluorescence changes caused by membrane interaction versus glycolipid binding. A signature Trp emission response, indicative of GSL binding by WT-GLTP, has been identified and characterized using select GLTP point mutants and different modes of glycolipid presentation, i.e. ethanol injection of pure GSLs and titration with membrane vesicles (LUVs and SUVs) containing GSLs as minor components. The signature Trp emission response has been used to comprehensively assess the glycolipid binding affinity of the novel GLTP fold for the first time, focusing on the impact of compositional variation of the sugar headgroup and nonpolar acyl chain moieties of the glycolipid. Most GalCers, LacCers, and sphingomyelins with homogeneous acyl chains were synthesized by reacylating GalSph, Lac-Sph, or lysosphingomyelin with the desired fatty acyl residue (24Smaby J.M.

Lipid vesicles were produced by extrusion or sonication (see supplemental information). Protein Expression and Purification—Our GLTP purifications have been described previously in detail (22Li X.-M.

Briefly, the open reading frame encoding human GLTP (National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) GenBank™ accession number AF209704) was subcloned into pET-30 Xa/LIC expression vector (Novagen) by ligation-independent cloning, enabling cleavage of the N-terminal His6-S tag to yield protein identical in sequence to native GLTP (12Malinina L. Malakhova M.L. Teplov A. Brown R.E. Patel D.J. Nature. 2004; 430: 1048-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 27Malakhova M.L. Malinina L. Pike H.M. Kanack A.T. Patel D.J. Brown R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26312-26320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). His6-GLTP also was prepared because structural analyses indicate that glycolipid binding might be subtly affected by the presence of the N-terminal fusion tag (13Malinina L. Malakhova M.L. Kanak A.T. Lu M. Abagyan R. Brown R.E. Patel D.J. PLoS Biol. 2006; 4: e362Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutants were produced by QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) and verified by sequencing. Near UV CD analysis confirmed the global folding similarity of WT-GLTP and W96F-GLTP (12Malinina L. Malakhova M.L. Teplov A. Brown R.E. Patel D.J. Nature. 2004; 430: 1048-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Protein purity and concentration were determined by SDS-PAGE and bicinchoninic acid (22Li X.-M. Malakhova M.L. Lin X. Pike H.M. Chung T. Molotkovsky J.G. Brown R.E. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10285-10294Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Glycolipid intervesicular transfer activity of purified GLTP was monitored using established assays involving fluorophore- or radiolabeled glycolipid (see supplemental information). Fluorescence Measurements—Emission spectra were measured using a SPEX FluoroMax instrument (HORIBA Scientific, Edina, NJ). Excitation and emission band passes were 5 nm, and the cuvette holder was temperature-controlled to 25 ± 0.1 °C (Neslab RTE-111, (Thermo Fisher Scientific)). To eliminate contributions from residues other than Trp, the excitation wavelength was 295 nm. Emission spectra were recorded from 305 to 500 nm using GLTP concentrations at optical densities >0.1 to avoid inner filter effects. GSL addition (2-μl aliquots; 0.1 mm GSL stock in ethanol) to protein (2.5 ml; 1 μm) involved constant stirring. Rapid equilibration of the fluorescence emission signal (<3 min) was observed for glycolipids containing either short saturated or longer unsaturated acyl chains (supplemental Fig. S2). Binding isotherms were adjusted for the constant fractional contributions of Trp-85 and Trp-142 determined from the emission response of W96F-GLTP. Dissociation constants were determined by nonlinear curve fitting using Prism 4.0 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA) (see supplemental information). Mass Spectrometry—WT-GLTP and GLTP·glycolipid complex were analyzed using an Agilent 6210 LC/MS-TOF mass spectrometer (Santa Clara, CA) by preparing (10 μm protein) in 5 mm ammonium acetate plus 5% methanol and infusing directly into the electrospray source. Spectra were collected in positive mode over an m/z range of 500–5000 using parameters optimized for complex stability, e.g. capillary, 3000 V; fragmentor, 300 V; skimmer, -60 V; octopole radio frequency, -300 V; octopole direct current, -32 V. Raw spectra data were transformed into relative molecular masses using the Agilent time-of-flight Protein Confirmation software. SHARP2 Analyses—WT-GLTP surface interaction site analysis was performed using SHARP2. The algorithm calculates parameters for overlapping patches of residues on the surface of a protein from Protein Data Bank (PDB) data (28Jones S. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Six parameters are assessed: solvation potential, hydrophobicity, accessible surface area, residue interface propensity, planarity, and protrusion (SHARP2) (29Jones S. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Patches are ranked according to combined parameter scores, enabling assessment as potential protein-protein interaction sites. Our previous x-ray crystallographic analyses showed that the 3 Trp residues of human GLTP are located in the vicinity of the glycolipid binding site (12Malinina L. Malakhova M.L. Teplov A. Brown R.E. Patel D.J. Nature. 2004; 430: 1048-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 13Malinina L. Malakhova M.L. Kanak A.T. Lu M. Abagyan R. Brown R.E. Patel D.J.

Biol. 2006; 355: 224-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Trp-96 and Trp-142 are surface-localized, 14–16Å apart, and reside within a putative membrane-interaction region that encompasses the glycolipid binding site (Fig. 1, upper panel, and supplemental Fig. S1, upper panel). Trp-96 also helps bind glycolipid by providing a stacking platform for the initial ceramide-linked sugar and facilitating formation of multiple hydrogen bonds between the sugar ring hydroxyls and Asp-48, Asn-52, and Lys-55 (Figs. 1B and 6). Trp-85 resides near the protein surface but is partially buried, with its indole ring sandwiched between Pro-86 (cis configuration) and Lys-78 (supplemental Fig. S1, lower panel). The topology of the 3 Trp residues in glycolipid-free WT-GLTP is reflected by the steady-state Trp fluorescence signal, which is relatively red-shifted (λmax ∼ 347 nm) and is diminished by aqueous quenchers (22Li X.-M. Malakhova M.L. Lin X. Pike H.M. Chung T. Molotkovsky J.G. Brown R.E. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10285-10294Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 23West G. Nylund M. Slotte J.P. Mattjus P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1758: 1732-1742Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). When glycolipid-free GLTP encounters membranes containing glycolipid, dramatic changes in Trp emission occur (22Li X.-M. Malakhova M.L. Lin X. Pike H.M. Chung T. Molotkovsky J.G. Brown R.E. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10285-10294Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 23West G. Nylund M. Slotte J.P. Mattjus P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1758: 1732-1742Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), consistent with Trp involvement in both the glycolipid binding site and the membrane-interaction region of GLTP. The changes include: (i) a large decrease in intensity and (ii) a substantial blue shift (∼12 nm) in wavelength maximum (λmax). Our initial goal was to establish whether the changes in Trp emission could be used to assess the binding affinity and uptake kinetics of various glycolipids by WT-GLTP.FIGURE 6Tryptophan 96 and neighboring residues in the GLTP·N-oleoyl LacCer complex.

The strategy of using ethanol injection was based on our previous findings showing that ethanolic solutions of glycolipids can facilitate cocrystallization of GLTP complexed with various glycolipid ligands (12Malinina L. Malakhova M.L. Teplov A. Brown R.E. Patel D.J. Nature. 2004; 430: 1048-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 13Malinina L. Malakhova M.L. Kanak A.T. Lu M. Abagyan R. Brown R.E. Patel D.J. PLoS Biol. 2006; 4: e362Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and that GLTP is highly adaptable in its ability to acquire glycolipids presented in various forms (27Malakhova M.L. Malinina L. Pike H.M. Kanack A.T. Patel D.J. Brown R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26312-26320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 illustrates a typical Trp emission response upon stepwise injections of LacCer ethanolic solution. The Trp emission λmax becomes progressively blue-shifted, i.e. 347–336 nm, whereas the intensity systematically decreases. Eventually, a saturation response is achieved as the λmax reaches ∼336 nm, and the total Trp emission intensity declines by ∼40%. It is important to note that each glycolipid injection corresponds to <10 mol % of total WT-GLTP and that the changes in Trp fluorescence occurred rapidly (<3–5 min) for glycolipids with short saturated or long monounsaturated acyl chains (supplemental Fig. S2), permitting fast equilibration. The emission response was similar for LacCers with oleoyl (18:1), nervonoyl (24:1), or octanoyl (8:0) acyl chains (e.g. Fig. 2A) and resulted in similar binding isotherms (Fig. 2C). In contrast, almost no changes in Trp emission were observed when POPC (Fig. 2B), l-α-dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine, 1-myristoyl,2-palmitoyl-sn-glycero 3-phosphocholine, or 1-myristoyl-2-stearoyl-sn-glycero 3-phosphocholine were presented with WT-GLTP. Formation of a WT-GLTP·glycolipid complex by GSL ethanol injection was verified by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). Fig. 3A shows spectra obtained by direct infusion of glycolipid-free GLTP plus GLTP·GalCer complex under nondenaturing conditions. Ions corresponding to monomeric, glycolipid-free rGLTP (25,248 Da) and monomeric complex (rGLTP + N-octanoyl GalCer (25,836 Da)) dominate the spectra. To further confirm that the observed changes in the Trp emission reflected glycolipid binding by WT-GLTP, alternate possibilities were evaluated. Adsorption of GLTP·glycolipid complex to the quartz cuvette walls, resulting in diminished protein solution concentration, was ruled out because applying a film of polyethyleneimine, which prevents protein adsorption to silica (30Persson D. Thorén P.E.G. Lincoln P. Nordén B. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11045-11055Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), did not alter the outcome (data not shown). Another possibility was Trp environmental polarity change caused by nonspecific partitioning of WT-GLTP to lipid aggregates/vesicles formed in solution after ethanol injection. However, adjustment of the WT-GLTP concentration from 1 μm to either 0.5 μm or 2 μm proportionally lowered or raised the glycolipid amount needed to saturate the spectral emission changes. Also, SEC analyses using Sephacryl S-300 showed that overnight incubations of WT-GLTP, with POPC vesicles containing glycolipid, resulted in vesicles eluting in the void volume (with almost no adsorbed WT-GLTP when vesicle concentrations were kept relatively low), whereas WT-GLTP (>95%) remained soluble and eluted in the included volume (Fig. 3B). The Trp emission signal of the soluble WT-GLTP exhibited a blue-shifted λmax (∼335 nm), a finding consistent with complexation of glycolipid. Collectively, the experimental results indicated that the changes in Trp emission reflected glycolipid binding by WT-GLTP. This conclusion was further supported by experiments involving a Trp-96 point mutant (W96F), which emits via Trp-85 and Trp-142 while maintaining ∼70% or more activity (12Malinina L. Malakhova M.L. Teplov A. Brown R.E. Patel D.J. Nature. 2004; 430: 1048-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2D and supplemental Fig. S3, W96F-GLTP emits at a λmax of ∼347 nm (like glycolipid-free WT-GLTP) but with only ∼30% intensity. Stepwise ethanol microinjection of 18:1 or 8:0 GalCer with W96F-GLTP resulted in only slight changes in the Trp emission response, i.e. 2–3-nm red shift in the λmax and 4–5% intensity decrease. This finding was consistent with Trp-96 accounting for the blue shift in the λmax and the vast majority of the Trp emission intensity decrease observed when WT-GLTP acquires glycolipid. Glycolipid Structural Parameters Affecting Binding by WT-GLTP—To determine whether the changes in WT-GLTP Trp fluorescence were glycolipid-specific, the responses elicited by ceramide and sphingomyelin were investigated. As expected, removal of the glycolipid sugar headgroup (supplemental Fig. S4A) or replacement with a nonsugar headgroup (supplemental Fig. S4B) had little effect on the intrinsic Trp emission. Next, various glycolipid structural parameters were evaluated. When the sugar headgroup was changed from lactose to either glucose or galactose, the dramatic blue shift in the λmax and decrease in Trp emission intensity persisted (supplemental Fig. S5) and resulted in similar binding isotherms (Fig. 4A). Ethanol injection of ganglioside GM1, which contains five sugars including negatively charged N-acetylneuraminic acid, also elicited a λmax blue shift and decrease in Trp emission intensity, albeit reduced in magnitude and affinity when compared with glycolipids with simpler headgroups (Fig. 4A). In contrast, removal of the amide-linked acyl chain of GlcCer or LacCer elicited very modest changes, i.e. 3–6-nm λmax blue shifts and 15–25% Trp intensity decreases, but only when added in high amounts (supplemental Fig. S4, C and D). Fig. 4B shows that very weak binding occurred with hexyl-β-d-glucoside, which also can occupy the GLTP binding site (13Malinina L. Malakhova M.L. Kanak A.T. Lu M. Abagyan R. Brown R.E. Patel D.J. PLoS Biol. 2006; 4: e362Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Binding Affinity of WT-GLTP for Different Glycolipids—Table 1 shows the binding constants for the spectral responses produced by titration of WT-GLTP with various glycolipids. KD values between ∼0.6 and 2.1 μm were determined for glycolipids with one or two sugars that contained either short saturated acyl chains or long acyl chains with mono- or diunsaturation. Slow equilibration was observed when these simple glycolipids contained long saturated acyl chains (>16 carbons), thus interfering with accurate assessment of KD values. With the multiglycosylated and more soluble ganglioside GM1, fast equilibration was observed despite the predominance of stearoyl acyl chains (supplemental Fig. S2). The KD for GM1 was ∼1.7 μm. The very modest spectral changes elicited by high amounts of lyso-GlcCer and lyso-LacCer translated into KD values of ∼80 and ∼60 μm, respectively. The lack of change in Trp fluorescence signal elicited by nonglycosylated lipids (e.g. ceramide, sphingomyelin, and PC) was consistent with lack of binding.TABLE 1KD values of WT-GLTP for various glycolipids Dissociation constants were determined by nonlinear fitting analyses of glycolipid-induced changes in GLTP Trp emission intensity as detailed in the supplemental information. Values were calculated at fixed wavelength (353 nm) in the emission peak (50Halter D. Neumann S. van Dijk S.M. Wolthoorn J. de Mazière A.M. Vieira O.V. Mattjus P. Klumperman J. van Meer G. Sprong H.

Pioneering phylogenetic studies have indicated a single origin of the GapC1 enzymes in eukaryotic evolution, but there are two potential idiosyncrasies in the GapC1 phylogeny: Firstly, the GapC1 tree topology is apparently inconsistent with the organismal relationship among the ""GapC1-containing"" groups. Secondly, four stramenopile GapC1 homologues are consistently paraphyletic in previously published studies, although these organisms have been widely accepted as monophyletic. For a closer examination of the above issues, in this study GapC1 gene sampling was improved by determining/identifying nine stramenopile and two cryptophyte genes. Phylogenetic analyses of our GapC1 dataset, which is particularly rich in the stramenopile homologues, prompt us to propose a new scenario that assumes multiple, lateral GapC1 gene transfer events to explain the incongruity between the GapC1 phylogeny and the organismal relationships amongst the ""GapC1-containing"" groups. Under our new scenario, GapC1 genes uniquely found in photosynthetic alveolates, photosynthetic stramenopiles, haptophytes, and cryptopyhytes are not necessarily a character vertically inherited from a common ancestor."

Sus1 mediates its different roles as a component of both the histone H2B deubiquitinating module (Sus1-Sgf11-Ubp8-Sgf73) of the SAGA (Spt-Ada-Gcn5 acetyltransferase) transcriptional co-activator and the mRNA export complex, TREX-2 (Sus1-Sac3-Thp1-Cdc31). We have dissected the different functions of Sus1 with respect to its partitioning in transcription and export complexes using a mutational approach. Here we show that the sus1–10 (E18A, S19A, and G20A) and sus1–12 (V73A and D75A) alleles of Sus1 can be dissociated from TREX-2 while leaving its interaction with SAGA largely intact. Conversely, the binding to both TREX-2 and SAGA was impaired in the sus1–11 allele (G37A and W38A), in which two highly conserved residues were mutated. In vitro experiments demonstrated that dissociation of mutant Sus1 from its partners is caused by a reduced affinity toward the TREX-2 subunit, Sac3, and the SAGA factor, Sgf11, respectively. Consistent with the biochemical data, these sus1 mutant alleles showed differential genetic relationships with SAGA and mRNA export mutants. In vivo, all three sus1 mutants were impaired in targeting TREX-2 (i.e. Sac3) to the nuclear pore complexes and exhibited nuclear mRNA export defects.

Sgf73 is the adaptor protein that anchors Sus1-Sgf11-Ubp8 at its N terminus and connects it to SAGA. Deletion of either SGF11 or SUS1 results in the dissociation of Ubp8 from Sgf73, implicating these proteins in the structural integrity of the DUB module (20Ingvarsdottir K. Krogan N.J. Emre N.C.

Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 4228-4236Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Importantly, Sgf73 together with Sus1 and Sgf11 are required for activation of Ubp8, which by itself is enzymatically inactive. The precise architecture of the DUB module has not been determined so far; however, Sus1 was shown to interact directly with the 99-residue protein Sgf11 both in vivo and in vitro (15Köhler A. Schneider M. Cabal G.G. Nehrbass U. Hurt E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 707-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Overall, a regulated cycle of histone H2B ubiquitin addition (catalyzed by Rad6/Bre1) and removal (Ubp8) at the promoter and coding region of a gene triggers multiple steps of gene activation and influences both transcription initiation and elongation (26Weake V.M.

Moreover, recent work has shown that SAGA-associated Sgf73 creates a link to TREX-2 by regulating TREX-2 assembly or stability, possibly through a chaperone activity (15Köhler A. Schneider M. Cabal G.G. Nehrbass U. Hurt E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 707-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Specifically, Sgf73 is required for recruiting the TREX-2 factors Sac3 and Thp1 to SAGA and promotes the association of Sus1 with a distinct domain of Sac3. This assembly event is critical for TREX-2 function (see below).The other Sus1-containing complex, TREX-2, functions in mRNA export as well as promoting transcription elongation and preventing DNA:RNA hybrid formation and genome instability (31Fischer T.

TREX-2 is composed of Sac3, Thp1, Cdc31, and Sus1. Recently, Sem1 was described as an additional TREX-2 subunit, but it is still unclear whether Sem1 is a stoichiometric component (37Wilmes G.M. Bergkessel M. Bandyopadhyay S. Shales M. Braberg H. Cagney G. Collins S.R. Whitworth G.B. Kress T.L. Weissman J.S. Ideker T. Guthrie C. Krogan N.J. Mol. Cell. 2008; 32: 735-746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Within TREX-2, Sus1 directly interacts with the Sac3 CID motif that also harbors a binding site for the calmodulin-like centrin Cdc31 (32Fischer T. Rodriguez-Navarro S. Pereira G. Racz A. Schiebel E. Hurt E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 840-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). TREX-2 is mainly localized at the nuclear periphery and interacts physically and functionally with the general mRNA export receptor Mex67/Mtr2 (31Fischer T. Strässer K. Racz A. Rodriguez-Navarro S. Oppizzi M. Ihrig P. Lechner J. Hurt E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5843-5852Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). NPC tethering of TREX-2 depends on the nuclear basket protein, Nup1, and possibly other nucleoporins (31Fischer T. Strässer K. Racz A. Rodriguez-Navarro S. Oppizzi M. Ihrig P. Lechner J. Hurt E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5843-5852Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Removal of the Sac3 CID strongly impairs TREX-2 targeting to the NPCs in vivo and triggers an mRNA export defect. Notably, the small Sus1 protein is important for NPC targeting of TREX-2, because SUS1 deletion causes TREX-2 dissociation from the NPCs (15Köhler A. Schneider M. Cabal G.G. Nehrbass U. Hurt E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 707-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar).In evolutionary terms, SAGA is well conserved in subunit composition and structural appearance and plays broad and important regulatory roles in transcription from yeast to flies and humans (18Daniel J.A. Grant P.A. Mutat. Res. 2007; 618: 135-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Specifically, the Sus1-containing histone H2B DUB module of SAGA has human orthologues, which include ENY2 (Sus1), the protease USP22 (Ubp8), ATXN7L3 (Sgf11), and ATXN7 (Sgf73) (38Zhao Y. Lang G.

EMBO J. 2008; 27: 394-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In analogy to yeast TREX-2, the Drosophila orthologue of Sus1, E(y)2, forms a complex with the Sac3 counterpart X-linked male sterile 2 (Xmas-2) and functions in mRNA export and gene-NPC anchorage (41Kurshakova M.M. Krasnov A.N. Kopytova D.V. Shidlovskii Y.V. Nikolenko J.V. Nabirochkina E.N. Spehner D. Schultz P. Tora L. Georgieva S.G. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 4956-4965Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The Sac3 orthologue GANP was reported to suppress DNA recombination in mammalian cells, but whether GANP operates in mRNA export and gene positioning remains to be explored (42Yoshida M. Kuwahara K. Shimasaki T. Nakagata N. Matsuoka M. Sakaguchi N. Genes Cells. 2007; 12: 1205-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 43Kuwahara K. Tomiyasu S. Fujimura S. Nomura K. Xing Y. Nishiyama N.

Kouzarides T. Laskey R. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Notably, a potential human orthologue of Cdc31, centrin 2, is associated with the NPCs and plays a role in the export of mRNA (45Resendes K.K. Rasala B.A. Forbes D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 1755-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The functional diversification of Sus1 as a component of both the SAGA histone DUB module and the TREX-2 mRNA export complex represents an intriguing example of molecular innovation during evolution. The small Sus1 protein can support both a sophisticated enzymatic mechanism and confer positional information for an NPC targeting event. Understanding Sus1 function therefore requires dissection of its separate SAGA- and TREX-2-related roles, integrated with an analysis of how SAGA and TREX-2 interact functionally.In this study we report a comprehensive mutational analysis of Sus1 aimed at defining the molecular requirements for its association with either SAGA or TREX-2. Our data show that mutational uncoupling of Sus1-ligand interactions results in selective functional impairments in transcription-coupled mRNA export.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESYeast Strains, Plasmids, and Microbiological Techniques—The S. cerevisiae strains used in this study are listed in supplemental Table 1. Deletion disruption and C-terminal TAP tagging at the genomic locus were performed as described previously (46Longtine M.S. McKenzie A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 10: 953-961Crossref Scopus (4106) Google Scholar, 47Janke C. Magiera M.M. Rathfelder N. Taxis C. Reber S. Maekawa H. Moreno-Borchart A. Doenges G. Schwob E. Schiebel E.

A two-step allele replacement method was devised to generate strains expressing nontagged and C-terminally TAP- or FLAG-tagged Sus1 wild-type or mutant variants (see below).Plasmids used in this study are listed in supplemental Table 2. The site-directed sus1 mutants were generated by fusion PCR, and the correctness of the cloned DNA fragments was verified by sequencing. All recombinant DNA techniques were done according to standard procedures using Escherichia coli DH5α for cloning and plasmid propagation.Preparation of media, yeast transformation, and genetic manipulations were performed according to established methods. For selection of yeast transformants on nourseothricin (clonNAT)-containing plates, YPD plates were supplemented with 100 μg/ml nourseothricin (Werner BioAgents). Tetrad dissection was performed using a Singer MSM micromanipulator.Genomic SUS1 Gene Replacement—To replace genomic wild-type SUS1 with nontagged and TAP- or FLAG-tagged sus1 alleles, we devised a novel two-step allele replacement strategy. In a first step, haploid sus1::klURA3 (URA3 gene from Kluyveromyces lactis) deletion disruption strains were obtained by tetrad dissection of a heterozygous diploid SUS1/sus1::klURA3 strain that had been created by transformation of a klURA3 PCR cassette, bearing short flanking homology regions of the SUS1 promoter and terminator sequence into the diploid W303 strain background. The haploid sus1::klURA3 null mutant strains were then co-transformed with DNA fragments (1 μg) containing wild-type and mutant SUS1, SUS1-TAP, or SUS1-FLAG alleles, excised by XhoI/BamHI digestion from pRS315-SUS1/sus1, pRS315-SUS1/sus1-TAP, or pRS316-SUS1/sus1-FLAG, and empty pRS315 vector (100 ng) for selection of transformants on SDC-Leu plates. To select for clones that had lost the klURA3 marker because of a site-specific recombination event, transformants were replica-plated onto 5-FOA-containing plates. To verify the correctness of the allele replacement, clones that grew on 5-FOA-containing medium were analyzed by colony PCR and sequencing.Affinity Purifications—TAP-tagged proteins were affinity-purified according to published methods (49Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Séraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2275) Google Scholar). Proteins were detected by SDS-PAGE on NuPAGE 4–12% polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen) with subsequent colloidal Coomassie Brilliant Blue G (Sigma) staining or by Western blot analysis. Mass spectrometric identification of the proteins contained in Coomassie-stained bands was performed as described (50Nissan T.A. Bassler J. Petfalski E. Tollervey D. Hurt E.C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5539-5547Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The following primary antibodies were used for Western analysis: anti-Arc1 (Hurt laboratory), anti-CBP (BioCat), anti-Cdc31 (from E. Schiebel, ZMBH, Heidelberg University, Germany), anti-FLAG (Sigma), and anti-Sac3 (from R. Kölling, Hohenheim University, Germany).In Vitro Binding Assays—Recombinant proteins were expressed in LB medium in E. coli BL21 codon plus RIL cells (Stratagene). Expression was induced by addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 23 °C for 3 h. Hexahistidine-tagged Sus1 was purified by metal affinity chromatography and imidazole elution. The GST-Sac3-(573–805)-Cdc31 heterodimer was created by co-expression of GST-Sac3-(573–805) and Cdc31. GST-tagged proteins were purified on GSH beads and eluted with GSH. Recombinant Sus1 proteins were then mixed with GST-Sgf11 or with GST-Sac3-(573–805)-Cdc31 at a 2:1 molar ratio, respectively, in a buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. Proteins were incubated with GSH beads for 30 min at 16 °C, washed in the same buffer (4 °C), and eluted with GSH. After trichloroacetic acid precipitation, the samples were separated by SDS-PAGE (12% gel, MES buffer) and visualized by Coomassie staining.Live Cell Imaging and Fluorescence Microscopy—Prior to live imaging, cells were grown to mid-log phase in YPD (integration strains) or SDC-Leu (plasmid-based) liquid medium. Fluorescence microscopy was performed using an Imager Z1 (Carl Zeiss) microscope equipped with a 100×/63× NA 1.4 Plan-Apo-Chromat oil immersion lens (Carl Zeiss) and using DICIII, HE-EGFP, or 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole filters. Images were acquired with an AxioCam MRm camera and AxioVision 4.3 software (Carl Zeiss).In situ hybridization of poly(A)+ RNA was performed according to Ref. 51Segref A. Sharma K. Doye V. Hellwig A. Huber J. Lührmann R. Hurt E.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3256-3271Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar. Prior to fixation, cells were grown to an A600 of 0.3 at 30 °C and then shifted to 37 °C for 2 h.Measurement of Global H2B Ubiquitin Levels—Immunoprecipitation of FLAG-tagged histone H2B was performed as described previously (52Kao C.F. Osley M.A. Methods (San Diego). 2003; 31: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).RESULTSSus1 is an evolutionary conserved protein in eukaryotes (Fig. 1a) with no homologues in viral, archaeal, and eubacterial genomes. Several Sus1 core residues are strongly conserved, whereas the N and C termini of the protein exhibit variable lengths and little sequence conservation. Secondary structure predictions indicate a primarily α-helical topology for Sus1 with five putative α-helices connected by short loop regions (Fig. 1b). We sought to generate a battery of sus1 mutants that could establish whether Sus1 employs distinct or overlapping interaction surfaces to bind to its two known ligands as follows: the CID (Cdc31 interaction domain) within the C terminus of Sac3 (32Fischer T. Rodriguez-Navarro S. Pereira G. Racz A. Schiebel E. Hurt E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 840-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) or Sgf11, a subunit of the SAGA histone H2B DUB module (15Köhler A. Schneider M. Cabal G.G. Nehrbass U. Hurt E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 707-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 25Köhler A. Pascual-Garcia P. Llopis A. Zapater M. Posas F. Hurt E. Rodriguez-Navarro S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 4228-4236Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). A “clustered charged-to-alanine mutagenesis” strategy (53Wertman K.F. Drubin D.G. Botstein D. Genetics. 1992; 132: 337-350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was initially used to probe for potential interaction surfaces on Sus1 (Fig. 1b). This approach exploits the fact that charged residues are generally exposed at the protein surface rather than being buried in the hydrophobic core of the molecule. Sus1-TAP purifications were then performed to biochemically check whether the interaction with either SAGA or TREX-2 or both was perturbed. Normally, Sus1 affinity-purified by the TAP method efficiently co-enriches both SAGA (including the SAGA-like SLIK(SALSA) complex) and TREX-2 (14Rodriguez-Navarro S. Fischer T. Luo M.J. Antunez O. Brettschneider S. Lechner J. Perez-Ortin J.E. Reed R. Hurt E. Cell. 2004; 116: 75-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, none of the nine mutants (sus1-1 to 9) significantly altered Sus1 binding to SAGA or TREX-2 (supplemental Fig. S1A). We found that deleting the less conserved N- and C-terminal parts of the protein (sus1ΔN1–10 and sus1ΔC91–96; see Fig. 1b) also did not impair the interaction of Sus1 with either SAGA or TREX-2 (data not shown). The remarkable tolerance of Sus1 toward this systematic replacement of charged residues may suggest that the interaction of Sus1 with its partners is based on other types of interaction (e.g. hydrophobic) or requires more extensive mutations to be disrupted.Next, we engineered point-specific mutations in putative loop regions in Sus1 that lie between the α-helices predicted by sequence analysis (Fig. 1b; termed sus1–10, sus1–11, and sus1–12). Each of these amino acid changes involved residues, such as Gly and Asp, that are characteristically present in flexible surface loops in proteins. Additionally, some of the selected residues (e.g. the Gly37Trp38 pair) are highly conserved in evolution (Fig. 1a). Notably, affinity purification of TAP-tagged Sus1–10 and Sus1–12 mutant proteins from yeast showed a pronounced loss of TREX-2 factors (i.e. Sac3, Thp1, and Cdc31), but typical SAGA factors (e.g. Tra1 and Spt7), including the DUB module components Sgf73, Sgf11, and Ubp8, were still co-enriched (Fig. 1c). Western blot analysis revealed that the loss of TREX-2 factors was more severe in sus1–10 than sus1–12 (Fig. 1c). These data indicate that whereas Sus1–10 and Sus1–12 are impaired in their interaction with TREX-2, the structural integrity of the SAGA DUB module (Sus1-Sgf11-Ubp8-Sgf73) remains largely unaffected in these sus1 mutants. In contrast, the purification of TAP-tagged Sus1–11 displayed a striking loss of both TREX-2 and SAGA subunits (Fig. 1c). Because Sgf11 was also absent from this purification, it is conceivable that a reduced affinity between Sus1 and its direct interaction partner Sgf11 may have dissociated Sus1 from the DUB module and hence from the entire SAGA complex (see below). The decrease or lack of a biochemical interaction observed for the different Sus1 mutant proteins is not because of major alterations in Sus1 protein levels. Wild-type and mutant Sus1 proteins exhibited similar expression levels in yeast, although we noticed a slight reduction in the total amount of Sus1–11 (Fig. 1c).To characterize the effects of the different sus1 alleles on TREX-2 subunit composition, we purified TREX-2 via TAP-tagged Thp1 and used Western blotting to determine the amount of bound mutant Sus1 proteins. Consistent with the results of the Sus1-TAP purifications, FLAG-tagged Sus1–10, Sus1–11, and Sus1–12 were specifically absent from the TREX-2 complex, whereas the other TREX-2 subunits Sac3 and Cdc31 were efficiently co-enriched with Thp1 (Fig. 1d). Taken together, the biochemical data indicate that sus1–10 and sus1–12 uncouple Sus1 from TREX-2, whereas the sus1–11 mutation effectively impairs the Sus1 interaction with both TREX-2 and SAGA.To confirm that the dissociation of Sus1 from TREX-2 or SAGA is caused primarily by a reduced affinity between Sus1-Sac3 and Sus1-Sgf11, we reconstituted these Sus1-ligand interactions in vitro (Fig. 2). Recombinant wild-type and mutant Sus1 proteins were first assayed for their ability to bind to a Sac3-(573–805)-Cdc31 heterodimer. This C-terminal fragment of Sac3 harbors the binding sites for Sus1 and Cdc31. Wild-type Sus1 bound to Sac3-(573–805)-Cdc31 very efficiently, whereas the binding was reduced with Sus1–10 and Sus1–12 and largely abolished for the Sus1–11 mutant. On the other hand, binding of Sus1–10 and Sus1–12 to Sgf11 was largely unaffected, whereas Sus1–11 failed to interact with Sgf11 (Fig. 2). We consider it unlikely that the perturbed Sus1-ligand interactions were caused by severe misfolding of the Sus1 mutants. CD spectra for the mutant Sus1 proteins were determined and found to be virtually indistinguishable from those of the wild-type protein (all showed prominent negative ellipticities at 220 nm consistent with the presence of an α-helical conformation; data not shown). In summary, the in vitro experiments largely recapitulate the Sus1-TAP affinity purifications, with Sus1–11 showing a global binding defect, whereas Sus1–10/-12 display a selective Sac3 interaction defect. We observed that the extent of Sus1–10/-12 dissoc"
https://openalex.org/W2023435545,"Remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton is a critical early step in skeletal muscle differentiation. Smooth muscle alpha-actin (SMA) is one of the earliest markers of myoblast differentiation and is important for the migration and cell shape changes that precede fusion. We have found that satellite cell-derived primary myoblasts from mice lacking the Barx2 homeobox gene show altered patterns of actin remodeling, reduced cell migration, and delayed differentiation. Consistent with the role of SMA in these processes, Barx2(-)(/)(-) myoblasts also show reduced expression of SMA mRNA and protein. The proximal SMA promoter contains binding sites for muscle regulatory factors and serum response factor as well as a conserved homeodomain binding site (HBS). We found that Barx2 binds to the HBS element and potentiates up-regulation of SMA promoter activity by MyoD. We also show that Barx2, MyoD, and serum response factor simultaneously occupy the SMA promoter in cells and that Barx2 interacts with MyoD. Overall these data indicate that Barx2 cooperates with other muscle-expressed transcription factors to regulate the early cytoskeletal remodeling events that underlie efficient myoblast differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2045755893,"Although the solute carrier 35B1 (SLC35B1) is evolutionarily conserved, its functions in metazoans remain unknown. To elucidate its function, we examined developmental roles of an SLC35B1 family gene (HUT-1: homolog of UDP-Gal transporter) in Caenorhabditis elegans. We isolated a deletion mutant of the gene and characterized phenotypes of the mutant and hut-1 RNAi-treated worms. GFP-HUT-1 reporter analysis was performed to examine gene expression patterns. We also tested whether several nucleotide sugar transporters can compensate for hut-1 deficiency. The hut-1 deletion mutant and RNAi worms showed larval growth defect and lethality with disrupted intestinal morphology. Inactivation of hut-1 induced chronic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and hut-1 showed genetic interactions with the atf-6, pek-1, and ire-1 genes involved in unfolded protein response signaling. ER ultrastructure and ER marker distribution in hut-1-deficient animals showed that HUT-1 is required for maintenance of ER structure. Reporter analysis revealed that HUT-1 is an ER protein ubiquitously expressed in tissues, including the intestine. Lethality and the ER stress phenotype of the mutant were rescued with the human hut-1 ortholog UGTrel1. These results indicate important roles for hut-1 in development and maintenance of ER homeostasis in C. elegans."
https://openalex.org/W2057164965,"Protein phosphorylation plays an important role in the regulation of centrosome duplication. In budding yeast, numerous lines of evidence suggest a requirement for multiple phosphorylation events on individual components of the centrosome to ensure their proper assembly and function. Here, we report the first example of a single phosphorylation event on a component of the yeast centrosome, or spindle pole body (SPB), that is required for SPB duplication and cell viability. This phosphorylation event is on the essential SPB component Spc29 at a conserved Thr residue, Thr(240). Mutation of Thr(240) to Ala is lethal at normal gene dosage, but an increased copy number of this mutant allele results in a conditional phenotype. Phosphorylation of Thr(240) was found to promote the stability of the protein in vivo and is catalyzed in vitro by the Mps1 kinase. Furthermore, the stability of newly synthesized Spc29 is reduced in a mutant strain with reduced Mps1 kinase activity. These results demonstrate the first evidence for a single phosphorylation event on an SPB component that is absolutely required for SPB duplication and suggest that the Mps1 kinase is responsible for this protein-stabilizing phosphorylation."
