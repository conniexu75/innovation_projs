https://openalex.org/W4295067320,"As pollinators and producers of numerous human-consumed products, honey bees have great ecological, economic and health importance. The composition of their bacteriota, for which the available knowledge is limited, is essential for their body’s functioning. Based on our survey, we performed a metagenomic analysis of samples collected by repeated sampling. We used geolocations that represent the climatic types of the study area over two nutritionally extreme periods (March and May) of the collection season. Regarding bacteriome composition, a significant difference was found between the samples from March and May. The samples’ bacteriome from March showed a significant composition difference between cooler and warmer regions. However, there were no significant bacteriome composition differences among the climatic classes of samples taken in May. Based on our results, one may conclude that the composition of healthy core bacteriomes in honey bees varies depending on the climatic and seasonal conditions. This is likely due to climatic factors and vegetation states determining the availability and nutrient content of flowering plants. The results of our study prove that in order to gain a thorough understanding of a microbiome’s natural diversity, we need to obtain the necessary information from extreme ranges within the host’s healthy state."

The Poisson Pseudo Maximum Likelihood (PPML) and the fixed effect models were also estimated simultaneously to confirm the robustness of our findings. The results reveal that China's economic size (GDP) and its importing countries, the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), common border, and the Chinese language positively determine China's agricultural export flows. The results, on the other hand, also reveal that China's agricultural export is adversely influenced by the income (per capita GDP) of China and its trade partners, currency depreciation, distance, and landlocked. On an average account, China has untapped the potential of 51% in its agriculture export with the countries used in this study. We provide policy suggestions as part of our study."
https://openalex.org/W4295028389,"Inflammatory cytokines and chemokines related to the innate and adaptive immune system have been linked to neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's Disease, dementia, and cognitive disorders. We examined the association of 11 plasma proteins (CD14, CD163, CD5L, CD56, CD40L, CXCL16, SDF1, DPP4, SGP130, sRAGE, and MPO) related to immune and inflammatory responses with measures of cognitive function, brain MRI and dementia risk. We identified Framingham Heart Study Offspring participants who underwent neuropsychological testing (n = 2358) or brain MRI (n = 2100) within five years of the seventh examination where a blood sample for quantifying the protein biomarkers was obtained; and who were followed for 10 years for incident all-cause dementia (n = 1616). We investigated the association of inflammatory biomarkers with neuropsychological test performance and brain MRI volumes using linear mixed effect models accounting for family relationships. We further used Cox proportional hazards models to examine the association with incident dementia. False discovery rate p-values were used to account for multiple testing. Participants included in the neuropsychological test and MRI samples were on average 61 years old and 54% female. Participants from the incident dementia sample (average 68 years old at baseline) included 124 participants with incident dementia. In addition to CD14, which has an established association, we found significant associations between higher levels of CD40L and myeloperoxidase (MPO) with executive dysfunction. Higher CD5L levels were significantly associated with smaller total brain volumes (TCBV), whereas higher levels of sRAGE were associated with larger TCBV. Associations persisted after adjustment for APOE ε4 carrier status and additional cardiovascular risk factors. None of the studied inflammatory biomarkers were significantly associated with risk of incident all-cause dementia. Higher circulating levels of soluble CD40L and MPO, markers of immune cell activation, were associated with poorer performance on neuropsychological tests, while higher CD5L, a key regulator of inflammation, was associated with smaller total brain volumes. Higher circulating soluble RAGE, a decoy receptor for the proinflammatory RAGE/AGE pathway, was associated with larger total brain volume. If confirmed in other studies, this data indicates the involvement of an activated immune system in abnormal brain aging."
https://openalex.org/W4295066709,"Among the many ambitious decarbonization goals globally, the US intends grid decarbonization by 2035, requiring 1 TW of installed photovoltaics (PV), up from ~110 GW in 2021. This unprecedented global scale-up will stress existing PV supply chains with increased material and energy demands. By 2050, 1.75 TW of PV in the US cumulatively demands 97 million metric tonnes of virgin material and creates 8 million metric tonnes of life cycle waste. This analysis leverages the PV in Circular Economy tool (PV ICE) to evaluate two circular economy approaches, lifetime extension and closed-loop recycling, on their ability to reduce virgin material demands and life cycle wastes while meeting capacity goals. Modules with 50-year lifetimes can reduce virgin material demand by 3% through reduced deployment. Modules with 15-year lifetimes require an additional 1.2 TW of replacement modules to maintain capacity, increasing virgin material demand and waste unless >90% of module mass is closed-loop recycled. Currently, no PV technology is more than 90% closed-loop recycled. Glass, the majority of mass in all PV technologies and an energy intensive component with a problematic supply chain, should be targeted for a circular redesign. Our work contributes data-backed insights prioritizing circular PV strategies for a sustainable energy transition."
https://openalex.org/W4295435789,"Novel computational methods such as artificial neural networks (ANNs) can facilitate modeling and predicting results of tissue culture experiments and thereby decrease the number of experimental treatments and combinations. The objective of the current study is modeling and predicting in vitro shoot proliferation of Erysimum cheiri (L.) Crantz, which is an important bedding flower and medicinal plant. Its micropropagation has not been investigated before and as a case study multilayer perceptron- non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (MLP-NSGAII) can be applied. MLP was used for modeling three outputs including shoots number (SN), shoots length (SL), and callus weight (CW) based on four variables including 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP), kinetin (Kin), 1-naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) and gibberellic acid (GA3). The R2 correlation values of 0.84, 0.99 and 0.93 between experimental and predicted data were obtained for SN, SL, and CW, respectively. These results proved the high accuracy of MLP model. Afterwards the model connected to Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) was used to optimize input variables for obtaining the best predicted outputs. The results of sensitivity analysis indicated that SN and CW were more sensitive to BA, followed by Kin, NAA and GA. For SL, more sensitivity was obtained for GA3 than NAA. The validation experiment indicated that the difference between the validation data and MLP-NSGAII predicted data were negligible. Generally, MLP-NSGAII can be considered as a powerful method for modeling and optimizing in vitro studies."
https://openalex.org/W4295048112,"Aims An increasing number of children and adolescents worldwide suffer from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) such as Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). The present work aims to investigate the incidence, prevalence and future trends of IBD in children and adolescents in Saxony, Germany. Methods The Saxon Pediatric IBD Registry collected data on patients up to 15 years of age from all 31 pediatric hospitals and pediatric gastroenterologists in Saxony over a 15-year period (2000–2014). In 2019, an independent survey estimated a registry completeness of 95.7%. Age-standardized incidence rates (ASR) per 100,000 person-years (PY) and prevalence per 100,000 children and adolescents were calculated. Evaluation was also been performed in sex and age subgroups. Joinpoint and Poisson regression were used for trend analyses and projections. Results 532 patients with confirmed IBD during 2000–2014 were included in the epidemiological evaluation. 63.5% (n = 338) patients had CD, 33.1% (n = 176) had UC and 3.4% (n = 18) had unclassified IBD (IBD-U). The 15-year IBD prevalence was 111.8 [95%-CI: 102.3–121.3] per 100,000. The incidence ASR of IBD per 100,000 PY over the whole observation period was 7.5 [6.9–8.1]. ASR for the subtypes were 4.8 [4.3–5.3] for CD, 2.5 [2.1–2.9] for UC and 0.3 [0.1–0.4] for IBD-U. The trend analysis of ASR using the joinpoint regression confirmed a significant increase for incidence of IBD as well as CD. For IBD, the ASR per 100,000 PY increased from 4.6 [2.8–6.3] in 2000 to 8.2 [7.5–13.6] in 2014; projected incidence rates for IBD in Germany are 12.9 [6.5–25.5] in the year 2025 and 14.9 [6.7–32.8] in 2030, respectively. Thus, the number of new IBD diagnoses in Germany would more than triple (325%) in 2030 compared to 2000. The increase is expected to be faster in CD than UC, and be more in males than in females. The expected number of newly diagnosed children with IBD in Germany is projected to rise to about 1,584 [1,512–1,655] in 2025, and to about 1,918 [1,807–2,29] in 2030. Conclusion The incidence of IBD in children and adolescents in Saxony increased at a similar rate as in other developed countries during the observation period. Given this trend, the health care system must provide adequate resources for the care of these young patients in the future."
https://openalex.org/W4295030597,"Background Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is the most frequent retinal hereditary dystrophy and result in blindness if progresses. Several case reports have revealed the possible association between RP and primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG). We conducted a population-based study to explore whether RP significantly increased the risk of PACG development. Methods Using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database, we enrolled patients with RP into the RP group from 2001 to 2013 and included a comparison group of 1:4 age- and sex-matched individuals without RP. We performed a Cox regression analysis to estimate the crude and adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of RP for PACG after adjustment for hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia, chronic kidney disease, and lens subluxation. Results We enrolled 6223 subjects with RP and 24892 subjects for comparison. The mean age of the cohort was 49.0 ± 18.1 years. The RP group had significantly higher percentages of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidaemia. The cumulative incidence of PACG in patients with RP was 1.61%, which was significantly higher than that in the comparison group (0.81%, p &lt; 0.0001). According to the univariate Cox regression analysis, the hazard of PACG development was significantly greater in the RP group, with an unadjusted HR of 2.09 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.64–2.65). The increased risk persisted after adjusting for confounders (adjusted HR = 2.18; 95% CI, 1.76–2.72). Conclusion This nationwide population-based cohort study showed that people with RP are at a significantly greater risk of developing PACG than individuals without RP."
https://openalex.org/W4295066720,"Outdoor and early biting by mosquitoes challenge the efficacy of bed nets and indoor residual spraying against malaria in the Greater Mekong Subregion. The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of outdoor residual spraying (ORS) for malaria vector-control in this region. A cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted between July 2018 and April 2019 in twelve villages in Karen (Kayin) state, Myanmar. Villages were randomly assigned to receive either a single round of ORS with a capsule suspension of lambda-cyhalothrin for two days in October or no intervention (six villages per group). The primary endpoint was the biting rate of malaria mosquitoes assessed with human-landing catch and cow-baited trap collection methods, and was analyzed with a Bayesian multi-level model. In the intervention villages, the proportion of households located within the sprayed area ranged between 42 and 100% and the application rate ranged between 63 and 559 g of active ingredient per hectare. At baseline, the median of Anopheles biting rate estimates in the twelve villages was 2 bites per person per night (inter-quartile range [IQR] 0–5, range 0–48) indoors, 6 bites per person per night (IQR 2–16, range 0–342) outdoors and 206 bites per cow per night (IQR 83–380, range 19–1149) in the cow-baited trap. In intention-to-treat analysis, it was estimated that ORS reduced biting rate by 72% (95% confidence interval [CI] 63–79) from Month 0 to Month 3 and by 79% (95% CI 62–88) from Month 4 to Month 6, considering control villages as the reference. In conclusion, ORS rapidly reduces the biting rates of malaria mosquitoes in a Southeast Asian setting where the vectors bite mostly outdoors and at a time when people are not protected by mosquito bed nets."
https://openalex.org/W4295027185,"The humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 can provide immunity and prevent reinfection. However, less is known about how the diversity, magnitude, and length of the antibody response after a primary infection is associated with symptoms, post-infection immunity, and post-vaccinated immunity.Cook County Health employees provided blood samples and completed an online survey 8-10 weeks after a PCR-confirmed positive SARS-CoV-2 test (pre-vaccinated, N = 41) and again, 1-4 weeks after completion of a 2-dose series mRNA BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine (post-vaccinated, N = 27). Associations were evaluated between SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers, participant demographics, and clinical characteristics. Antibody titers and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) neutralization were compared before and after the mRNA BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine.Antibody titers to the spike protein (ST4), receptor binding domain (RBD), and RBD mutant D614G were significantly associated with anosmia and ageusia, cough, and fever. Spike protein antibody titers and ACE2 neutralization were significantly higher in participants that presented with these symptoms. Antibody titers to the spike protein N-terminal domain (NTD), RBD, and ST4, and ACE2 IC50 were significantly higher in all post-vaccinated participant samples compared to pre-vaccinated participant sample, and not dependent on previously reported symptoms.Spike protein antibody titers and ACE2 neutralization are associated with the presentation of anosmia and ageusia, cough, and fever after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Symptom response to previous SARS-CoV-2 infection did not influence the antibody response from subsequent vaccination. These results suggest a relationship between infection severity and the magnitude of the immune response and provide meaningful insights into COVID-19 immunity according to discrete symptom presentation."
https://openalex.org/W4295027641,"Background Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) are the recommended treatment for uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in all malaria endemic countries. Artemisinin resistance, partner drug resistance, and subsequent ACT failure are widespread in Southeast Asia. The more recent independent emergence of artemisinin resistance in Africa is alarming. In response, triple artemisinin-based combination therapies (TACTs) are being developed to mitigate the risks associated with increasing drug resistance. Since ACTs are still effective in Africa, where malaria is mainly a paediatric disease, the potential deployment of TACTs raises important ethical questions. This paper presents an analysis of stakeholders’ perspectives regarding key ethical considerations to be considered in the deployment of TACTs in Africa provided they are found to be safe, well-tolerated and effective for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria. Methods We conducted a qualitative study in Burkina Faso and Nigeria assessing stakeholders’ (policy makers, suppliers and end-users) perspectives on ethical issues regarding the potential future deployment of TACTs through 68 in-depth interviews and 11 focus group discussions. Findings Some respondents suggested that there should be evidence of local artemisinin resistance before they consider deploying TACTs, while others suggested that TACTs should be deployed to protect the efficacy of current ACTs. Respondents suggested that additional side effects of TACTs compared to ACTs should be minimal and the cost of TACTs to end-users should not be higher than the cost of current ACTs. There was some disagreement among respondents regarding whether patients should have a choice of treatment options between ACTs and TACTs or only have TACTs available, while ACTs are still effective. The study also suggests that community, public and stakeholder engagement activities are essential to support the introduction and effective uptake of TACTs. Conclusion Addressing ethical issues regarding TACTs and engaging early with stakeholders will be important for their potential deployment in Africa."
https://openalex.org/W4295031517,"Most of the existing studies on maker-space focus on internal subjects (such as makers) or external factors (such as policy support, ecological environment, and more). There has been relatively little discussion on the design of a series of mechanisms of maker-space. This paper theorizes the operating mechanism for platform services, resource gathering, network connections and endogenous cultural protection for the maker-space. It uses the method of fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to analyze data from 63 maker-spaces in Zhejiang Province. The study proposes a reasonable mechanism design scheme for maker-space. The results show that the innovativeness of a maker-space is the result of the synergistic effect of various operating mechanisms. Among them, the platform service function, the channel for gathering resources, the formal linkages, and the culture for sharing achievements are indispensable support mechanisms for maker-spaces. Two effective ways to promote innovation in maker-space are outlined: first, preventing interventions from external resource providers; second, building an inclusive culture of trial and error."

We explored the perceptions of frontline ICU staff about the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, and how this experience impacted their personal and professional lives.In a qualitative study as part of the PsyCOVID-ICU project, we conducted semi-structured interviews with a random sample of nurses and nurses' aides from 5 centres participating in the main PsyCOVID study. Interviews were recorded and fully transcribed, and analysed by thematic analysis.A total of 18 interviews were performed from 13 August to 6 October 2020; 13 were nurses, and 5 were nurses' aides. Thematic analysis revealed three major themes, namely: (1) Managing the home life; (2) Conditions in the workplace; and (3) the meaning of their profession.In this qualitative study investigating the experiences and perceptions of healthcare workers caring for critically ill patients during the first COVID-19 wave in France, the participants reported that the crisis had profound repercussions on both their personal and professional lives. The main factors affecting the participants were a fear of contamination, and the re-organisation of working conditions, against a background of a media ""infodemic""."
https://openalex.org/W4295066176,"Deep neural networks have shown great improvements in low-dose computed tomography (CT) denoising. Early algorithms were primarily optimized to obtain an accurate image with low distortion between the denoised image and reference full-dose image at the cost of yielding an overly smoothed unrealistic CT image. Recent research has sought to preserve the fine details of denoised images with high perceptual quality, which has been accompanied by a decrease in objective quality due to a trade-off between perceptual quality and distortion. We pursue a network that can generate accurate and realistic CT images with high objective and perceptual quality within one network, achieving a better perception-distortion trade-off. To achieve this goal, we propose a stationary wavelet transform-assisted network employing the characteristics of high- and low-frequency domains of the wavelet transform and frequency subband-specific losses defined in the wavelet domain. We first introduce a stationary wavelet transform for the network training procedure. Then, we train the network using objective loss functions defined for high- and low-frequency domains to enhance the objective quality of the denoised CT image. With this network design, we train the network again after replacing the objective loss functions with perceptual loss functions in high- and low-frequency domains. As a result, we acquired denoised CT images with high perceptual quality using this strategy while minimizing the objective quality loss. We evaluated our algorithms on the phantom and clinical images, and the quantitative and qualitative results indicate that ours outperform the existing state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of objective and perceptual quality."

Self-management has been proposed as one way to enable people living with the condition to improve or maintain their quality of life and wellbeing whilst living at home.To explore the views and experiences of how people living with Parkinson's self-manage their condition and identify areas needed to be incorporated into self-management resources or interventions.Twenty people with Parkinson's from across London and Hertfordshire, UK took part in semi-structured interviews on self-management. Interviews were transcribed and analysed using thematic analysis to identify themes.Three main themes were identified: (1) Management of physical symptoms, which included engaging in physical activities, adapting their lifestyles, managing medication and using e-health resources; (2) Management of emotional impact, which involved using a range of cognitive and practical strategies, and seeking talking therapies and medication; and (3) barriers to self-management such as accessing accurate information, experiencing stigma towards their condition which impacted their self-esteem and identity, in turn impacting on their ability to self-manage.Holistic and person-centred self-management programmes or interventions should be developed incorporating components such as medication and emotional support, individualised planning of exercise regimes, and accessible, timely and accurate information. Furthermore, more public health knowledge on Parkinson's is needed to help reduce stigma."
https://openalex.org/W4295027406,"The risk of malnutrition is an important predictor of functional capacity in the elderly population. However, whether malnutrition is associated with functional capacity in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) is poorly known.To analyse the association between the risk of malnutrition and functional capacity in patients with PAD.This cross-sectional study included 135 patients with PAD of both genders, ≥50 years old, with symptomatic PAD (Rutherford stage I to III) in one or both limbs and with ankle-brachial index ≤0.90. The risk of malnutrition was assessed by the short form of the Mini Nutritional Assessment-Short Form and patients were classified as having normal nutritional status (n = 92) and at risk of malnutrition (n = 43). Functional capacity was objectively assessed using the six-minute walking test (6MWT, absolute maximal distance and relativized and expressed as a percentage of health subjects), short-physical performance battery (SPPB, balance, gait speed and the sit and stand test) and the handgrip test, and subjectively, using the Walking Impairment Questionnaire and Walking Estimated-Limitation Calculated by History. The association between the risk of malnutrition and functional capacity was analysed using bivariate and multivariate logistic regression adjustments for gender, age, ankle-brachial index, body mass index, use of statins, coronary arterial disease and stroke. For all statistical analyses, significance was accepted at p<0.05.Thirty-two per cent of our patients were classified with a risk of malnutrition. The risk of malnutrition was associated with the absolute 6MWT total distance (OR = 0.994, P = 0.031) relative 6MWT total distance (OR = 0.971, P = 0.038), lowest SPPB total score (OR = 0.682, P = 0.011), sit and stand (OR = 1.173, P = 0.003) and usual 4-meter walk test (OR = 1.757, P = 0.034).In patients with PAD, the risk of malnutrition was associated with objective measurements of functional capacity."
https://openalex.org/W4295047880,"Primary congenital glaucoma (PCG) is a heterogeneous rare recessively inherited disorder prevalent in regions with high consanguinity. Disease phenotype is associated with increased intra ocular pressure and is a major cause of childhood blindness. Sequence variations in Cytochrome P450 1B1 (CYP1B1) gene are a major cause of PCG. Current study was conducted to screen CYP1B1 gene in highly consanguineous PCG affected families from Pakistani population consistent with the autosomal recessive pattern of PCG inheritance.For this study, patients and controls (clinically unaffected individuals of each family) from 25 consanguineous families belonging to Punjab, Baluchistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan were recruited through ophthalmologists. DNA was isolated from collected blood samples. Genetic screening of CYP1B1 gene was done for all enrolled families. In-silico analysis was performed to identify and predict the potential disease-causing variations.Pathogenicity screening revealed sequence variants segregating with disease phenotype in homozygous or compound heterozygous form in eleven out of 25 analyzed families. We identified a total of sixteen disease causing variants among which five frameshift i.e., c.629dup (p.Gly211Argfs*13), c.287dup (p.Leu97Alafs*127), c.662dup (p.Arg222Profs*2), c.758_759insA (p.Val254Glyfs*73) and c.789dup (p.Leu264Alafs*63), two silent c.1314G>A, c.771T>G and six missense variations c.457C>G (p.Arg153Gly), c.516C>A (p.Ser172Arg), c.722T>A (p.Val241Glu), c.740T>A (p.Leu247Gln), c.1263T>A (p.Phe421Leu), and c.724G>C (p.Asp242His) are previously un reported. However two frameshift c.868dup (p.Arg290Profs*37), c.247del (p.Asp83Thrfs*12) and one missense variant c.732G>A (p.Met244Ile), is previously reported. Furthermore, six polymorphisms c.1347T>C, c.2244_2245insT, c.355G>T, c.1294G>C, c.1358A>G and c.142C>G were also identified. In the intronic region, a novel silent polymorphism i.e., g.35710_35711insT was found in homozygous state. All the newly detected disease-causing variants were negative in 96 ethnically matched controls.Among twenty-five screened families, eight families (PCG50, 52-54, 58, 59, 63 and 67) were segregating disease causing variants in recessive manner. Two families (PCG049 and PCG062) had compound heterozygosity. Our data confirms genetic heterogeneity of PCG in Pakistani population however we did not find molecular variants segregating with PCG in fifteen families in coding exons and intron-exon boundaries of CYP1B1 gene. Genetic counseling was provided to families to refrain from practicing consanguinity and perform premarital screening as a PCG control measure in upcoming generations."
https://openalex.org/W4295047957,"Background Community health workers (CHWs) have been identified as a critical bridge to reaching many communities with essential health services based on their social and geographical proximity to community residents. However, various challenges limit their performance, especially in low-and middle-income countries. With the view to guiding global and local stakeholders on how best to support CHWs, this study explored common challenges of different CHW cadres in various contexts. Methods We conducted 36 focus group discussions and 131 key informant interviews in Bangladesh, India, Kenya, Malawi, and Nigeria. The study covered 10 CHW cadres grouped into Level 1 and Level 2 health paraprofessionals based on education and training duration, with the latter having a longer engagement. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. Results We identified three critical challenges of CHWs. First, inadequate knowledge affected service delivery and raised questions about the quality of CHW services. CHWs’ insufficient knowledge was partly explained by inadequate training opportunities and the inability to apply new knowledge due to equipment unavailability. Second, their capacity for service coverage was limited by a low level of infrastructural support, including lack of accommodation for Level 2 paraprofessional CHWs, inadequate supplies, and lack of transportation facilities to convey women in labour. Third, the social dimension relating to the acceptance of CHWs’ services was not guaranteed due to local socio-cultural beliefs, CHW demographic characteristics such as sex, and time conflict between CHWs’ health activities and community members’ daily routines. Conclusion To optimise the performance of CHWs in LMICs, pertinent stakeholders, including from the public and third sectors, require a holistic approach that addresses health system challenges relating to training and structural support while meaningfully engaging the community to implement social interventions that enhance acceptance of CHWs and their services."
https://openalex.org/W4295048285,"The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a complex network of non-malignant cells and stroma that perform a wide array of vital roles in tumor growth, immune evasion, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance. These highly diverse roles have been shown to be critically important to the progression of cancers and have already shown potential as therapeutic targets. Therefore, there has been a tremendous push to elucidate the pathways that underlie these roles and to develop new TME-directed therapies for cancer treatment. Unfortunately, TME-focused research has been limited by a lack of translational in vitro culture platforms that can model this highly complex niche and can support the integrated analysis of cell biology and function. In the current study, we investigate whether an independently developed reconfigurable microfluidic platform, known as Stacks, can address the critical need for translational multi-cellular tumor models and integrated analytics in TME research. We present data on multi-cellular culture of primary human cells in Stacks as well as the orthogonal analysis of cellular polarization, differentiation, migration, and cytotoxicity in this reconfigurable system. These expanded capabilities of Stacks are highly relevant to the cancer research community with the potential to enhance clinical translation of pre-clinical TME studies and to yield novel biological insight into TME crosstalk, metastasis, and responses to novel drug combinations or immune therapies."
https://openalex.org/W4295066443,"In the name of health security, individual freedoms were constrained in an unprecedented way in many countries, democratic or authoritarian, all over the world during the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet the constraints have not been consistent across countries, which motivates this paper to examine the relevance of value preferences towards freedom or security in the society for COVID-19 policies. Based on data for 40 democratic and authoritarian countries, the analyses show that the variation in the stringency of COVID-19 policies can be explained by value preferences of the population only in autocracies. In democracies, however, we do not find such a relationship. Governments in democratic political systems, we argue, are responsive to their constitutions and face prosecution by the judiciary if they violate the law or provisions of the constitution, limiting their capacity to implement strong COVID-19 policies. Nevertheless, their COVID-19 policies restricted citizens’ freedoms and liberties, which means that these policies were rather not responsive to citizens’ preferences for freedom, democratic rights and liberties. By highlighting how autocracies respond to their citizens’ value preferences for security, this paper contributes to a better understanding of how autocracies might gain legitimacy in times of crises."
https://openalex.org/W4295027296,"Although the carcinogenic effects of high-dose radiation are well-established, the risks at low doses, such as from diagnostic X-rays, are less well understood. Children are susceptible to radiation induced cancers, and in the last decade, several cohort studies have reported increased cancer risks following computed tomography (CT) scans in childhood. However, cohort studies can be limited by insufficient follow-up, indication bias, reverse causation, or by lack of organ doses from CT scans or other exposures. Aust-PERC is a retrospective cohort designed to study the effects of low-dose medical radiation exposure, primarily from CT scans, in young Australians. The cohort was ascertained using deidentified billing records from patients who were aged 0-19 years while enrolled in Medicare (Australia's universal healthcare system) between 1985 and 2005. All procedures billed to Medicare in this age/time window that involved low-dose radiation were identified, and persons without such procedures were flagged as unexposed. The Aust-PERC cohort has been linked, using confidential personal identifiers, to the Australian Cancer Database and the National Death Index, on two occasions (to Dec. 2007 and Dec. 2012) by the responsible government agency (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare). Deidentified Medicare service records of all radiological procedures including CT scans, nuclear medicine (NM) scans and fluoroscopy and plain X-ray procedures have been available to derive estimated radiation doses in the cohort. Records of other medical and surgical procedures, together with demographic and socioeconomic variables are being used in analyses to assess biases arising from reverse causation and confounding. After excluding patients with errant records, 11 802 846 persons remained in the baseline cohort, with an average follow-up time of 22.3 years to December 2012. There were 275 489 patients exposed to diagnostic nuclear medicine scans and 688 363 patients exposed to CT scans before age 20 and before cancer diagnosis. Between 1 January 1985 and 31 December 2012, there were 105 124 deaths and 103 505 incident cancers. Dose-response analyses based on the relevant organ doses are underway for individual cancers, and we plan to extend the follow-up for another 8 years to Dec 2020. Analyses using this very large Aust-PERC cohort, with extended follow-up, will help to resolve international uncertainties about the causal role of diagnostic medical radiation as a cause of cancer."
https://openalex.org/W4295027567,"Ingested inorganic arsenic (iAs) is a human carcinogen that is also linked to other adverse health effects, such as respiratory outcomes. Yet, among populations consuming low-arsenic drinking water, the impact of iAs exposure on childhood respiratory health is still uncertain. For a Spanish child study cohort (INfancia y Medio Ambiente—INMA), low-arsenic drinking water is usually available and ingestion of iAs from food is considered the major source of exposure. Here, we explored the association between iAs exposure and children’s respiratory outcomes assessed at 4 and 7 years of age ( n = 400). The summation of 4-year-old children’s urinary iAs, monomethylarsonic acid (MMA), and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) was used as a biomarker of iAs exposure (∑As) (median of 4.92 μg/L). Children’s occurrence of asthma, eczema, sneeze, wheeze, and medication for asthma and wheeze at each assessment time point (i.e., 4- and 7-year) was assessed with maternal interviewer-led questionnaires. Crude and adjusted Poisson regression models using Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) were performed to account for the association between natural logarithm transformed (ln) urinary ∑As in μg/L at 4 years and repeated assessments of respiratory symptoms at 4 and 7 years of age. The covariates included in the models were child sex, maternal smoking status, maternal level of education, sub-cohort, and children’s consumption of vegetables, fruits, and fish/seafood. The GEE—splines function using Poisson regression showed an increased trend of the overall expected counts of respiratory symptoms with high urinary ∑As. The adjusted expected counts (95% confidence intervals) at ln-transformed urinary ∑As 1.57 (average concentration) and 4.00 (99 th percentile concentration) were 0.63 (0.36, 1.10) and 1.33 (0.61, 2.89), respectively. These exploratory findings suggest that even relatively low-iAs exposure levels, relevant to the Spanish and other populations, may relate to an increased number of respiratory symptoms during childhood."
https://openalex.org/W4295027655,"Purpose The increased demand for training of mechanical thrombectomy in ischemic stroke and development of new recanalization devices urges the creation of new simulation models both for training and device assessment. Clots properties have shown to play a role in procedural planning and thrombectomy device effectiveness. In this study, we analyzed the characteristics and applicability of completely synthetic, animal-free clots in the setting of an in-vitro model of mechanical thrombectomy for training and device assessment. Methods Synthetic clots based on agarose (n = 12) and silicone (n = 11) were evaluated in an in-vitro neurointervention simulation of mechanical thrombectomy with clot extraction devices. Calcified clots of mixed nature were simulated with addition of 3D printed structures. 9 clots were excluded due to insufficient vessel occlusion and failure to integrate with clot extraction device. Synthetic thrombi were characterized and compared using a categorical score-system on vessel occlusion, elasticity, fragmentation, adherence and device integration. Results Both agarose-based and silicone-based clots demonstrated relevant flow arrest and a good integration with the clot extraction device. Silicone-based clots scored higher on adherence to the vessel wall and elasticity. Conclusion Selected synthetic clots can successfully be implemented in an in-vitro training environment of mechanical thrombectomy. The clots’ different properties might serve to mimic fibrin-rich and red blood cell-rich human thrombi."
https://openalex.org/W4295027859,"New research shows that the prevalence of neurodevelopmental disorders, such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), is increased in children and adolescents as well as in adults with chronic pain, compared to those without chronic pain. Children and adolescents with ADHD also have an increased incidence of various physical conditions associated with pain, and they more frequently suffer from inflammatory diseases. Moreover, parents of children with ADHD can often suffer from pain conditions. These epidemiological and clinical observations form the scientific basis of our study, which aims to map the relationships between ADHD, altered pain experiences/central sensitization, and inflammation in children and adolescents. We will investigate the presence of central sensitization in children and adolescents with newly diagnosed ADHD and compare it with those who have not been diagnosed with ADHD. Participants (and their biological parents) will complete surveys about their somatic health, pain experience, and quality of life. Biological samples (saliva and stool) will be collected, aiming to utilize proteome and metabolome data to discover disease mechanisms and to predict, prevent and treat them. The results from our investigation should enable an expanded understanding of the pathophysiology behind both ADHD and pain/central sensitization. Presently, there are no established protocols for addressing psychiatric symptoms when examining patients with pain conditions in a somatic care setting, nor is there any knowledge of offering patients with ADHD or other neurodevelopmental disorders adapted treatments for pain conditions. Our results, therefore, can contribute to the development of new treatment strategies for pathological pain conditions in children and adolescents with ADHD. They may also increase awareness about and provide opportunities for the treatment of attention and impulse control problems in children and adolescents with pain syndromes."
https://openalex.org/W4295028362,"In this study, thirty-four soil samples from a typical chlor-alkali slag residue storage site near the city of Qiqihar in northeastern China were collected and their arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, mercury, nickel, lead and zinc concentrations were determined. Sources of these heavy metals were analyzed with a positive matrix factorization model, and the health risks associated with different pollution sources were calculated. The results showed that mercury was the main heavy metal pollutant at the site (maximum concentration of 112.19 mg.kg −1 ) and the soil was also contaminated with arsenic, copper and lead. The sources of eight heavy metals were: mixed oil refinery wastewater and parent material (arsenic, chromium, copper and lead), vinyl chloride waste source (mercury), parent material (cadmium, nickel and zinc). The average potential ecological risk of the soil was 22344.39, with vinyl chloride waste source contributing 99.85% of this risk. The average carcinogenic risk of a mixture of oil refinery wastewater and parent material for children and adults was 9.06×10 −6 and 6.36×10 −6 , respectively, accounting for 99.9% (children) and 99.48% (adults) of the total average carcinogenic risk. The average hazard index of vinyl chloride waste source for children and adults was 0.6 and 0.38, respectively, which accounted for 64.13% (children) and 52.34% (adults) of the total hazard index. These results provide a reference for soil pollution risk assessments at this type of site."
https://openalex.org/W4295030624,"Commuting flows and long-distance travel are important spreading factors of viruses and particularly airborne ones. Therefore, it is relevant to examine the association among diverse mobility scenarios and the spatial dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 cases. We intended to analyze the patterns of virus spreading linked to different mobility scenarios, in order to better comprehend the effect of the lockdown measures, and how such measures can be better informed. We simulated the effects of mobility restrictions in the spread of SARS-CoV-2 amongst the municipalities of two metropolitan areas, Lisbon (LMA) and Porto (PMA). Based on an adapted SEIR (Suscetible-Exposed-Infected-Removed) model, we estimated the number of new daily infections during one year, according to different mobility scenarios: restricted to essential activities, industrial activities, public transport use, and a scenario with unrestricted mobility including all transport modes. The trends of new daily infections were further explored using time-series clustering analysis, using dynamic time warping. Mobility restrictions resulted in lower numbers of new daily infections when compared to the unrestricted mobility scenario, in both metropolitan areas. Between March and September 2020, the official number of new infections followed overall a similar timeline to the one simulated considering only essential activities. At the municipal level, trends differ amongst the two metropolitan areas. The analysis of the effects of mobility in virus spread within different municipalities and regions could help tailoring future strategies and increase the public acceptance of eventual restrictions."
https://openalex.org/W4295031095,"The study aimed at exploring factors that most influence colorectal cancer (CRC) age standardized mortality ratio (ASMR) among Korean women, as reported in previous studies. The factors used the data of 250 municipalities from the Korean Statistical Information Service (KOSIS) from 2010 to 2018. In the exploratory survey, over 70% of women aged 65 and above died of colorectal cancer. After investigating the existing literature and theories, 250 regions were classified into hot and cold spots according to age standardized mortality ratio (ASMR). The Nearest Neighbor Index (NNI), Moran's I index and The Durbin-Watson test were also utilized. The ASMR's regional cluster analysis showed that the inland areas were the hot spots and the cold spots were in the southwest coastal areas. The result also showed the differences in dwellers' lifestyles between these two regions as well as the mean difference between the two. In addition, there was no significant difference in ASMR for breast cancer, CRC deaths, and agricultural product shipments between the two regions. In the multiple regression model, CRC mortality, diabetes, and CRC age standardized incidence ratio (ASIR) were analyzed as major influencing factors, demonstrated a significant result with 30.6% by examining the adjusted R-squared. However, this study showed that factors such as smoking, alcohol consumption, abdominal obesity, breast cancer, and food consumption indicated to have less influence on the occurrence of CRC. The aging rate, amount of food consumption, seafood production, livestock product shipments, and drinking rate were higher in the cold spot than in the hot spot."
https://openalex.org/W4295047790,"Introduction Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has a high mortality and requires effective treatment with anti-MRSA agents such as vancomycin (VCM). Management of the efficacy and safety of VCM has been implemented with the assignment of pharmacists in hospital wards and the establishment of teams related to infectious diseases. However, there are no reports evaluating the association between these factors and the efficacy and safety of VCM in large populations. Methods This study used the Japanese administrative claims database accumulated from 2010 to 2019. The population was divided into two groups, therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) group and non-TDM group, and adjusted by propensity score matching. We performed multivariate logistic regression analysis to determine the influence of pharmacists and infection control teams or antimicrobial stewardship teams on acute kidney injury (AKI) and 30-day mortality. Results The total number of patients was 73 478 (TDM group, n = 55 269; non-TDM group, n = 18 209). After propensity score matching, 18 196 patients were matched in each group. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that pharmacological management for each patient contributed to the reduction of AKI (odds ratio [OR]: 0.812, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.723‒0.912) and 30-day mortality (OR: 0.538, 95% CI: 0.503‒0.575). However, the establishment of infectious disease associated team in facilities and the assignment of pharmacists in the hospital wards had no effect on AKI and 30-day mortality. In addition, TDM did not affect the reduction in AKI (OR: 1.061, 95% CI: 0.948‒1.187), but reduced 30-day mortality (OR: 0.873, 95% CI: 0.821‒0.929). Conclusion Pharmacologic management for individual patients, rather than assignment systems at facilities, is effective to reduce AKI and 30-day mortality with VCM administration."
https://openalex.org/W4295066410,"According to the sequential stage model, the selection and the execution of a motor response are two distinct independent processes. Here, we propose a new adaptive paradigm for identifying the individual duration of the response preparatory period based on the motor reaction time (RT) data. The results are compared using the paradigm with constant values of the preparatory period. Two groups of participants performed on either an easy (Group 1) or a hard (Group 2) response selection task with two types of stimuli based on the preparatory period parameters: (1) stimuli with a constant preparatory period duration of 0 or 1200 ms and (2) stimuli with adaptive preparatory period durations. Our analysis showed an increase in the duration of the response selection process as a function of increasing task complexity when using both paradigms with constant and adaptive values of the preparatory period duration. We conclude that the adaptive paradigm proposed in the current paper has several important advantages over the constant paradigm in terms of measuring the response accuracy while being equally efficiently in capturing other critical response parameters."
https://openalex.org/W4295066764,"The immune response and specific antibody production in COVID-19 are among the key factors that determine both prognostics for individual patients and the global perspective for controlling the pandemics. So called ""dark figure"", that is, a part of population that has been infected but not registered by the health care system, make it difficult to estimate herd immunity and to predict pandemic trajectories. Here we present a follow up study of population screening for hidden herd immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in individuals who had never been positively diagnosed against SARS-CoV-2; the first screening was in May 2021, and the follow up in December 2021. We found that specific antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 detected in May as the ""dark figure"" cannot be considered important 7 months later due to their significant drop. On the other hand, among participants who at the first screening were negative for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG, and who have never been diagnosed for SARS-CoV-2 infection nor vaccinated, 26% were found positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG. This can be attributed to of the ""dark figure"" of the recent, fourth wave of the pandemic that occurred in Poland shortly before the study in December. Participants who were vaccinated between May and December demonstrated however higher levels of antibodies, than those who undergone mild or asymptomatic (thus unregistered) infection. Only 7% of these vaccinated participants demonstrated antibodies that resulted from infection (anti-NCP). The highest levels of protection were observed in the group that had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 before May 2021 and also fully vaccinated between May and December. These observations demonstrate that the hidden fraction of herd immunity is considerable, however its potential to suppress the pandemics is limited, highlighting the key role of vaccinations."

However, COVID-19, a novel coronavirus disease with strong human-to-human transmission, hit China in late 2019 and forced the Chinese government to suspend classes and clinical internships. To cope with this situation, e-internship, which facilitate varied interactions without the need for direct contact, is used as an alternative strategy to help nursing students continue their internships.To describe the perceptions and experiences of undergraduate nursing students in e-internships during the COVID-19 pandemic.A descriptive phenomenological design was adopted. Seventeen undergraduate nursing students in a major teaching hospital in Changsha, China, were recruited into the study. Data were collected through semi-structured, in-depth, face-to-face interviews. The interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using Colaizzi's approach.Four themes were captured from the data analysis: perceived images of clinical nurses in e-internships, psychological experience, perceived benefits of e-internships, and perceived limitations of e-internships.Our findings suggest that e-internship is a suitable method for training and cultivating undergraduate nursing students during a crisis. To enhance the efficiency of e-internships, guidelines and standards should be formulated, and effective measures should be taken to build better e-internship platforms. In the future, we suggest combine on-site internships with e-internships, thereby fully using their advantages, and improve the efficiency of internships as much as possible."
https://openalex.org/W4295067067,"Child feces are an important source of fecal exposure in household environments. Typically, one of two behaviors is necessary to mitigate this risk: either caregivers dispose of their children’s feces into a latrine or children learn how to use a latrine. Although past studies have examined factors associated with these two behaviors collectively (i.e. “safe disposal”), there is a need to separately analyze these distinctive practices to better inform programming. This study aims to quantitatively examine contextual and psychosocial factors influencing caregiver safe disposal and, separately, child latrine training. We surveyed 791 primary female caregivers, who reported on 906 children &lt;5 years old, across 74 villages in rural Odisha, India. At their last defecation event, 38% of children used the latrine and another 10% had their feces safely disposed of into the latrine. Since caregiver safe disposal was rare, we instead assessed safe disposal intention . We used linear regression and multilevel mixed effects models to examine contextual and psychosocial factors. For contextual factors, we found caregivers had stronger safe disposal intention when they came from wealthier households and had greater informational support, but weaker intention when their latrine was near the household. Caregivers more intensely practiced latrine training with their child when they themselves used the latrine for defecation, the latrine was fully intact, and they had greater instrumental support. For psychosocial factors, caregivers had stronger safe disposal intention when their households expected them to practice safe disposal, they felt strongly committed to the behavior, and had a plan for what to do when faced with a water shortage. Caregivers more intensely taught their child how to use the latrine when they believed their child was at risk of becoming sick if they practiced open defecation (OD); viewed child OD as unbeneficial; liked teaching their child; personally felt it was important for the child’s father to help; felt confident in their ability to teach their child; and had greater action control over their training practice. Interestingly, caregivers put less effort into latrine training when they felt more concerned for their child’s safety when the child defecated outside. These findings underscore the critical need to separately assess unique child feces management (CFM) practices and also provide a road map for practitioners on the types of behavior change strategies to consider in their CFM programming."

While some instruments have been developed to measure CKD awareness, we lack validated instruments to evaluate patients' awareness of ESKD and dialysis modalities. This study is part of multipart project for developing and validating an ESKD-centric disease awareness questionnaire.A team of specialty renal care experts developed a 45-items questionnaire encompassing the subdomains of General Kidney Knowledge, CKD Knowledge, and ESKD Knowledge. Item reduction analysis-specifically, calculation of item difficulty and item discrimination index scores-was used to items for further review and potential removal.Index scores were reviewed in conjunction with consideration of theoretical and substantive item content to reduce the number of items in the questionnaire, resulting in a 32-item questionnaire, retaining 5/10 items in the general kidney knowledge subdomain, 14/21 items in the CKD knowledge subdomain, and 13/14 items in the ESKD knowledge subdomain. Retained items ranged from 0.19 to 0.79 on the difficulty index, and from 0.31 to 0.81 on the discrimination index. Scores for percent correct on the reduced questionnaire spanned 0% to 87.5% correct on the full scale, 0% to 100% correct on the General Knowledge subdomain, 0% to 100% on the CKD Knowledge subdomain, and 0% to 92.3% on ESKD Knowledge subdomain.The questionnaire developed and refined in this study constitutes a patient disease awareness instrument that spans a range of difficulty, and yet shows strong ability to distinguish between patients with varying levels of disease awareness. This study is the first in part of a multistep project to addresses a gap in measuring ESKD specific knowledge. Accurate assessment of patients' disease awareness through a validated instrument can allow identification of knowledge domains leading to positive impacts on their healthcare decisions and improve targeted patient education efforts."
https://openalex.org/W4295067473,"Dairy products are important constituents of a healthy and balanced diet, but their association with health outcomes remains to be established. We investigated the association of total dairy, total fermented dairy, and different dairy subtypes (including total/high-fat/low-fat milk, yogurt, cheese, butter, and cream) and the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), coronary heart disease (CHD), bone fracture and all-cause mortality among 1746 Danish healthy men and women (30–60 years, 52%female). Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were estimated using the multivariable Cox proportional hazard models. During a mean follow-up of 30 years, incident cases of CVD ( n = 904), CHD ( n = 332), fracture ( n = 447) and all-cause mortality ( n = 680) were reported. High intake of total fermented dairy was associated with lower fracture risk (HR 0.67, 95% CI: 0.51–0.90, P = 0.02) than observed in the lowest tertile of the fermented dairy group. Furthermore, high intake of low-fat milk was associated with lower risks of CVD (HR 0.84, 95% CI: 0.68–1.03, P = 0.03), CHD (HR 0.82, 95% CI: 0.59–1.16, P = 0.04), and all-cause mortality (HR 0.77, 95% CI: 0.61–0.97, P = 0.004) compared with the lowest tertile of low-fat milk group. No associations were found with other dairy subtypes. The findings from this prospective cohort study suggest an inverse association between total fermented dairy and fracture risk, and also inverse associations were found between low-fat milk consumption and risk of CVD, CHD and all-cause mortality."
https://openalex.org/W4295027111,"Colorectal cancer is well known for its ""adenoma-carcinoma"" sequential carcinogenesis. Some colorectal cancers demonstrate a residual adenoma component during progression from adenoma to invasive carcinoma. However, the clinicopathological significance of residual adenoma component remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate the clinicopathologic and molecular characteristics including the KRAS mutation in colorectal cancers containing a residual adenoma component.In this study, 498 surgically resected colorectal cancer patients were enrolled. Their detailed clinicopathologic features and results of molecular study including KRAS mutation test and microsatellite instability were analyzed.A residual adenoma component was identified in 42 (8.4%) patients with colorectal cancer. The presence of a residual adenoma component was associated with a high frequency of the KRAS mutation (65%, p = 0.031) as well as indolent clinicopathological features, including polypoid gross type (p < 0.001), well-differentiated histology (p < 0.001), low pT (p < 0.001) and pN stage (p = 0.003), absence of vascular invasion (p = 0.005), and a better progression-free prognosis (p = 0.029). The cases with an adenoma component had a 35.7% discordance rate on the KRAS mutation tests in their adenoma and carcinoma regions.In conclusion, colorectal cancer with a residual adenoma component showed indolent clinicopathologic features and frequent KRAS mutations. Due to the discordance in the incidence of the KRAS mutation between the adenoma and carcinoma components, the adenoma component should be documented in the pathology report, and care should be taken not to include the adenoma component when collecting samples for molecular testing."
https://openalex.org/W4295027268,"The present study investigated how women’s body image and body-perceptual processes are affected by navel piercings, an embellishment of the abdominal region women often feel negatively about. We probed perceptual (response times), cognitive (surveys), affective (aesthetic ratings) and neural (event-related potentials, ERPs) facets of (own) body perception. We found that navel piercings are primarily motivated by the desire to enhance one’s body image, and can significantly improve bodily self-perception relative to before and to imagined removal of the piercing. Hence, body image concerns in women with navel piercings were found to be comparable to those of a control group; and their aesthetic ratings of other women’s abdomens only differed, positively, for images depicting navel piercings. ERPs indicated that the sight of navel piercings enhances early structural encoding of bodies as well as late emotional-motivational processes, especially in women with navel piercings. We further found a strong self-advantage in both cortical and behavioural responses during recognition of own and others’ abdomens, especially for images displaying the piercing. Altogether, findings suggest that navel piercings become strongly, and beneficially, integrated into women’s bodily self image. Such piercings may thus be seen as expressions of body care that can protect against self-harming thoughts and behaviours."

Assessing the effectiveness of different management methods also requires estimating the processes that change population size, such as the rates of recruitment into and removal from a population. This is one of the first studies to quantify the size, rates of recruitment and removal, and health and welfare status of free-roaming dog populations in Europe. We determined the size, dynamics, and health status of free-roaming dog populations in Pescara, Italy, and Lviv, Ukraine, over a 15-month study period. Both study populations had ongoing dog population management through catch-neuter-release and sheltering programmes. Average monthly apparent survival probability was 0.93 (95% CI 0.81–1.00) in Pescara and 0.93 (95% CI 0.84–0.99) in Lviv. An average of 7 dogs km -2 were observed in Pescara and 40 dogs km -2 in Lviv. Per capita entry probabilities varied between 0.09 and 0.20 in Pescara, and 0.12 and 0.42 in Lviv. In Lviv, detection probability was lower on weekdays (odds ratio: 0.74, 95% CI 0.53–0.96) and higher on market days (odds ratio: 2.58, 95% CI 1.28–4.14), and apparent survival probability was lower in males (odds ratio: 0.25, 95% CI 0.03–0.59). Few juveniles were observed in the study populations, indicating that recruitment may be occurring by movement between dog subpopulations (e.g. from local owned or neighbouring free-roaming dog populations), with important consequences for population control. This study provides important data for planning effective dog population management and for informing population and infectious disease modelling."

https://openalex.org/W4295028213,"Background Couples HIV Counselling and Testing (CHCT) has been found to be potentially beneficial than individual HIV Counselling and Testing for prevention and treatment of HIV. However, there are few health care opportunities for men and women to access health services together, leading to underutilization of CHCT service. Integrating female Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH) services into male-dominated service could be more effective than trying to integrate men’s health services into female-dominated health services. A potential site for male-female service integration could be Voluntary Medical Male Circumcision (VMMC) centers. Methodology We conducted a qualitative study in Lilongwe, Malawi between June to August 2018. Twenty VMMC clients, 20 peers and 20 VMMC providers completed individual in-depth interviews to share their opinions on what they thought about integrating CHCT and other SRH Services into VMMC services. These proposed SRH services include family planning, cervical cancer screening, sexually transmitted infection management and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Content analysis was used to analyze the results. Results All participants were receptive to integration of CHCT, and most accepted the integration of SRH services into VMMC Services. Most VMMC clients, peers and care providers said that CHCT integration would help couples to know their HIV status, prevent HIV transmission, encourage healthy relationships, and provide a chance for women to participate in VMMC counselling and wound care. However, integration of other services, such as family planning and cervical cancer screening, drew mixed opinions among participants. Most VMMC clients, peers and providers felt that integration of services would promote male involvement and increase men’s knowledge in feminine sexual reproductive health services. A few providers expressed concerns over service integration, citing reasons such as overcrowding, work overload, gender mixing, and lack of provider capacity and space. Most participants supported integrating PrEP with VMMC Services and felt that PrEP would complement VMMC in HIV prevention. Few providers, peers and VMMC clients felt the addition of PrEP to VMMC services would lead to high-risk sexual activity that would then increase the risk for HIV acquisition. A few participants recommended community sensitization when integrating some of sexual reproductive health services into VMMC Services to mitigate negative perceptions about VMMC services and encourage service uptake among couples Conclusion Most participants service providers, VMMC clients and Peers were receptive to integrating SRH services, particularly HIV prevention services such as CHCT and PrEP, into male dominated VMMC services. Adequate community sensitization is required when introducing other SRH services into VMMC services."
https://openalex.org/W4295028394,"Roughly one-fifth of the global population is affected by poor visual acuity. Despite the fact that inhabitants of rural areas in low-income countries are most distressed by this, no prior research has studied the impact of poor visual acuity on the economic performance of farms. We conduct a standardized eye test with 288 farm managers in rural Cambodia and find that around 30 percent of our sample suffers from poor visual acuity in terms of nearsightedness (myopia). Our analyses indicate a statistically significant and economically meaningful association of poor visual acuity with economic farm performance. Our results show that gross margins for cropping activities per year could be, on average, around 630 USD higher if farm managers were able to correct for poor vision. Our results suggest that poor visual acuity impairs farm managers from tapping the full potential of their business, which in turn decreases their chance to break the vicious cycle of poverty."

Increased opioid prescription receipt is a major contributor to the opioid crisis; however, our understanding of prescription patterns and risk factors among those with a history of interpersonal violence remains elusive. This study sought to identify 5-year longitudinal patterns of opioid prescription receipt among patients experiencing interpersonal violence within a large healthcare system and sociodemographic and clinical characteristics associated with prescription patterns. This secondary analysis examined electronic health record data from January 2004-August 2019 for a cohort of patients (N = 1,587) referred for interpersonal violence services. Latent class growth analysis was used to estimate trajectories of opioid prescription receipt over a 5-year period. Standardized differences were calculated to assess variation in sociodemographic and clinical characteristics between classes. Our cohort had a high prevalence of prescription opioid receipt (73.3%) and underlying co-morbidities, including chronic pain (54.6%), substance use disorders (39.0%), and mental health diagnoses (76.9%). Six prescription opioid receipt classes emerged, characterized by probability of any prescription opioid receipt at the start and end of the study period (high, medium, low, never) and change in probability over time (increasing, decreasing, stable). Classes with the highest probability of prescription opioids also had the highest proportions of males, chronic pain diagnoses, substance use disorders, and mental health diagnoses. Black, non-Hispanic and Hispanic patients were more likely to be in low or no prescription opioid receipt classes. These findings highlight the importance of monitoring for synergistic co-morbidities when providing pain management and offering treatment that is trauma-informed, destigmatizing, and integrated into routine care."
https://openalex.org/W4295030923,"Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is one of the most common types of cancers in South China and Southeast Asia. Clinical data has shown that early detection is essential for improving treatment effectiveness and survival rate. Unfortunately, because the early symptoms of NPC are rather minor and similar to that of diseases such as Chronic Rhinosinusitis (CRS), early detection is a challenge. This paper proposes using machine learning methods to detect NPC using routine medical test data, namely Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), k-Nearest-Neighbor (KNN) and Logistic Regression (LR). We collected a dataset containing 523 newly diagnosed NPC patients before treatment, 501 newly diagnosed CRS patients before treatment as well as 600 healthy controls. The routine medical test data including age, gender, blood test features, liver function test features, and urine sediment test features. For comparison, we also used data from Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) antibody tests, which is a specialized test not included among routine medical tests. In our first test, all four methods were tested on classifying NPC vs CRS vs controls; RF gives the best overall performance. Using only routine medical test data, it gives an accuracy of 83.1%, outperforming LR by 12%. In our second test, using only routine medical test data, when classifying NPC vs non-NPC (i.e. CRS or controls), RF achieves an accuracy of 88.2%. In our third test, when classifying NPC vs. controls, RF using only routine test data achieves an accuracy significantly better than RF using only EBV antibody data. Finally, in our last test, RF trained with NPC vs controls, using routine test data only, continued to perform well on an entirely separate dataset. This is a promising result because preliminary NPC detection using routine medical data is easy and inexpensive to implement. We believe this approach will play an important role in the detection and treatment of NPC in the future."
https://openalex.org/W4295031462,"Surgical site infection (SSI) is a common but potentially serious maternal complication of cesarean section (CS). C-reactive protein (CRP) can be used in early detection of SSI. However, its predictive value for post-cesarean SSI has never been investigated. This study aims to evaluate the predictive value of CRP for the development of SSI. This was a hospital-based retrospective cohort study of 748 pregnant women who underwent CS at our university hospital between January 2017 and December 2019. CRP was measured on postoperative days 1, 3, and 6. The predictive values of CRP for SSI were evaluated using receiver operating characteristics analysis. Forty-seven (6.3%) patients developed SSI, of whom 38 (80.9%) underwent emergency CS. Serum CRP levels were significantly higher in the SSI group than in the non-SSI group from postoperative day 1 (64 vs. 81 mg/L, p = 0.001); the difference became more evident on postoperative days 3 and 6. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for CRP on days 1, 3, and 6 was 0.58 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.49 to 0.68), 0.70 (0.62 to 0.78) and 0.73 (0.65 to 0.81), respectively. The optimal cutoff value for day 3 and 6 CRP was 66.4 mg/L (sensitivity = 76.1% and specificity = 54.4%) and 22.2 mg/L (sensitivity = 76.5% and specificity = 63.2%), respectively. CRP on postoperative days 3 and 6 can be used as a predictive marker for the development of SSI after CS. Further studies to validate the predictive value in different populations is essential."
https://openalex.org/W4295049035,"Impairment of gluconeogenesis is a key factor responsible for hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes. As an important member of the suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) protein family, many physiological functions of cytokine-inducible SH2-containing protein (CISH) have been described; however, the role of hepatic CISH in gluconeogenesis is poorly understood. In the present study, we observed that hepatic CISH expression was reduced in fasted wild-type (WT) mice. Overexpression of CISH decreased glucose production in mouse primary hepatocytes, while silencing of CISH had the opposite effects. In addition, adenovirus-mediated hepatic CISH overexpression resulted in improved glucose tolerance and decreased gluconeogenesis in WT and leptin receptor-deficient diabetic (db/db) mice. In contrast, adenovirus-mediated hepatic CISH knockdown impaired glucose tolerance and increased gluconeogenesis in WT mice. We also generated liver-specific CISH knockout (LV-CISH KO) mice and discovered that these mice had a similar phenotype in glucose tolerance and gluconeogenesis as mice injected with adenoviruses that knockdown CISH expression. Mechanistically, we found that CISH overexpression decreased and CISH knockdown increased the mRNA and protein levels of glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 (PEPCK), two key enzymes involved in gluconeogenesis, in vitro, and in vivo. Moreover, we discovered that the phosphorylation of cAMP-responsive element binding protein 1 (CREB), a transcription factor of G6pase and Pepck, was required for regulating gluconeogenesis by CISH. Taken together, this study identifies hepatic CISH as an important regulator of gluconeogenesis. Our results also provide important insights into the metabolic functions of the SOCS protein family and the potential targets for the treatment of diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W4295066262,"To determine whether biological and sociodemographic factors at birth and current factors are associated with insufficient physical activity during leisure among Brazilian adolescents.A school-based cross-sectional study with national coverage was conducted involving Brazilian adolescents 12 to 17 years of age in municipalities with more than 100 thousand residents. The sample consisted of 74,589 adolescents who participated in the Study of Cardiovascular Risk in Adolescents. Insufficient leisure-time physical activity was categorized based on total volume (<300 minutes/week = insufficiently active; >300 minutes/week = sufficiently active). Poisson regression models were used to assess associated factors.Most adolescents were classified as insufficiently active (54.8%; 95%CI: 53.7-55.9). The variables associated with insufficient physical activity during leisure were the female sex (70.4%; 95%CI: 68.8-71.9), age between 15 and 17 years (57.8%; 95%CI: 56.3-59.2), pertaining to the low or middle class (54.5%; 95%CI: 52.8-56.1), and not being overweight (55.9%; 95%CI: 54.6-57.1).Contrary to our hypothesis, birth related factors (e.g., low birth weight, preterm birth and exclusive breastfeeding until 6 months of age) are not associated with physical inactivity. The prevalence of insufficient physical activity during leisure was high among the adolescents evaluated and was associated with sociodemographic characteristics as well as nutritional status. It is necessary to implement strategies focused on physical activity at schools."
https://openalex.org/W4295066729,"The purpose of this study was to examine sex-specific differences in the blood glucose (BG) response to recurrent aerobic exercise in type 1 diabetes rats. Specifically, we examined the role of peak estrogen (E2) concentrations during proestrus on BG response to prolonged repetitive aerobic exercise. To do so, nineteen Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to four exercised groups: control female (CXF; n = 5), control male (CXM; n = 5), diabetic female (DXF, n = 5) and diabetic male (DXM, n = 4). Diabetes was induced in DX groups via subcutaneous multiple injections of low dose streptozotocin (20mg/day for 7 days). After four days of exercise, muscle and liver glycogen content, liver gluconeogenic enzyme content, muscle Beta oxidation activity and BG responses to exercise were compared. The final bout of exercise took place during proestrus when E2 concentrations were at their highest in the female rats. During days 1-3 DXM had significantly lower BG concentrations during exercise than DXF. While both T1DM and non-T1DM females demonstrated higher hepatic G6Pase expression and muscle beta oxidation activity levels on day 4 exercise, no differences in BG response between the male and female T1DM rats were evident. Further, no differences in liver and muscle glycogen content following day 4 of exercise were seen between the sexes. These results would suggest that heightened E2 levels during proestrus may not be an important factor governing glucose counter regulatory response to exercise in female T1DM rats. Rather, the pre-exercise blood glucose levels are likely to be a large determinant of the blood glucose response to exercise in both male and female rats."
https://openalex.org/W4295067085,"In this article, we construct an international oligopoly that explicitly incorporates transporter behavior. In each country, there is one firm that produces differentiated goods and invests in product-differentiating R&D and one transporter that transports the differentiated goods. We adopt a three-stage game in which the firms decide their R&D investment level to determine the degree of horizontal differentiation, the transporters determine the transportation prices through Cournot competition, and then the firms determine the quantities of production. We find that an increase in R&D efficiency in the product differentiation of firms leads to a decrease in transportation prices. We also reveal that an increase in the efficiency of product differentiation always reduces the profits of firms. These results explain the empirically plausible long-term trend of declining transportation prices and also provide a counterintuitive implication that efficiency gains reduce the degree of product differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W4295067132,"A round-robin tournament is a contest where each and every player plays with all the other players. In this study, we propose a round-robin based tournament selection operator for the genetic algorithms (GAs). At first, we divide the whole population into two equal and disjoint groups, then each individual of a group competes with all the individuals of other group. Statistical experimental results reveal that the devised selection operator has a relatively better selection pressure along with a minimal loss of population diversity. For the consisting of assigned probability distribution with sampling algorithms, we employ the Pearson’s chi-square and the empirical distribution function as goodness of fit tests for the analysis of statistical properties analysis. At the cost of a nominal increase of the complexity as compared to conventional selection approaches, it has improved the sampling accuracy. Finally, for the global performance, we considered the traveling salesman problem to measure the efficiency of the newly developed selection scheme with respect to other competing selection operators and observed an improved performance."
https://openalex.org/W4295067262,"Environmental enrichment improves the health and wellbeing of zoo animals. To test this hypothesis, we used Indian leopards ( Panthera pardus fusca ), one of the popular zoo animals, as a model organism to understand effects of active and passive enrichment elements on stress hormone levels of captive individuals. We included three enrichment categories, category ‘A’ (having both active: cage size of 1204 m 3 with raised platforms and earthen flooring, and passive: controlled temperature, playback of forest sounds and sound proof glass to filter visitors’ noise, enrichment elements), category ‘B’ (active enrichment type I, cage size of 264 m 3 with air coolers), and category C (active enrichment type II, cage size of 517 m 3 without air coolers) for leopards (n = 14) housed in two Indian zoos. We used a group-specific enzyme immunoassay to measure fecal glucocorticoid metabolites (fGCM) in captive leopards. For comparison, we analysed samples from free-ranging leopards, as well. fGCM levels (Mean±SEM) were 10.45±2.01 and 0.95±0.003 μg/g dry feces in captive and free-ranging leopards, respectively. Our results revealed that fGCM levels of leopards in categories B and C were significantly (P&lt;0.05) different from each other, thus, indicating cage size (an active enrichment element) as an important factor in influencing the physiology of the sampled animals. Overall, the findings of the study will contribute towards informed policies for management of captive Indian leopards."
