https://openalex.org/W1591653197,"Matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) has been purified as an inactive zymogen of M(r) 92,000 (proMMP-9) from the culture medium of HT 1080 human fibrosarcoma cells. The NH2-terminal sequence of proMMP-9 is Ala-Pro-Arg-Gln-Arg-Gln-Ser-Thr-Leu-Val-Leu-Phe-Pro, which is identical to that of the 92-kDa type IV collagenase/gelatinase. The zymogen can be activated by 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate, yielding an intermediate form of M(r) 83,000 and an active species of M(r) 67,000, the second of which has a new NH2 terminus of Met-Arg-Thr-Pro-Arg-(Cys)-Gly-Val-Pro-Asp-Leu-Gly-Arg-Phe-Gln-Thr- Phe-Glu. Immunoblot analyses demonstrate that this activation process is achieved by sequential processing of both NH2- and COOH-terminal peptides. TIMP-1 complexed with proMMP-9 inhibits the conversion of the intermediate form to the active species of M(r) 67,000. The proenzyme is fully activated by cathepsin G, trypsin, alpha-chymotrypsin, and MMP-3 (stromelysin 1) but not by plasmin, leukocyte elastase, plasma kallikrein, thrombin, or MMP-1 (tissue collagenase). During the activation by MMP-3, proMMP-9 is converted to an active species of M(r) 64,000 that lacks both NH2- and COOH-terminal peptides. In addition, HOCl partially activates the zymogen by reacting with an intermediate species of M(r) 83,000. The enzyme degrades type I gelatin rapidly and also cleaves native collagens including alpha 2 chain of type I collagen, collagen types III, IV, and V at undenaturing temperatures. These results indicate that MMP-9 has different activation mechanisms and substrate specificity from those of MMP-2 (72-kDa gelatinase/type IV collagenase)."
https://openalex.org/W1483907253,"We describe a simplified and reliable polymerase chain reaction-based method for assaying RNAs of low abundancy. The technique involves the co-amplification of cellular RNA-derived cDNA with a multispecific cDNA of synthetic origin added as an internal standard, using primer pairs common to both templates. We show that the co-amplified templates accumulate in a parallel manner throughout both the exponential and nonexponential phases of amplification, even when the starting amounts of the templates differ by up to 2 orders of magnitude. This finding means that preliminary experiments designed to determine either the late exponential region or the amplification efficiency for each pair of primers are unnecessary. This has enabled us to develop a greatly simplified quantitation protocol. We illustrate our approach by quantifying the effect of the immunosuppressor cyclosporin A on the accumulation of interleukin-4, interferon-gamma, and interleukin-2 receptor mRNAs in phytohemagglutinin-stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells."
https://openalex.org/W1574918102,"We report here the cDNA cloning and characterization of a rat basic helix-loop-helix (HLH) factor, designated HES-5. This factor has a distant sequence homology to Drosophila hairy and Enhancer-of-split proteins, both of which are required for normal neurogenesis. DNase I footprinting analyses show that HES-5 binds to the sequence CACNAG (called N box), a recognition sequence of Enhancer-of-split proteins. Although HES-5 does not bind to the sequence CANNTG (called E box) recognized by other HLH factors, it attenuates the binding of E47, an HLH activator, to E box by forming a hetero-oligomer. In cotransfection analyses using NIH 3T3 cells, HES-5 significantly represses transcription originating from the promoter containing the N box sequences. Furthermore, HES-5 also partially inhibits the E47-induced expression from the promoter containing E boxes. Northern blot, RNase protection, and in situ hybridization analyses demonstrate that the HES-5 mRNA is specifically expressed in the nervous system. Prominent expression is observed in the ventricular zones of the embryonal brain vesicles and the outer nuclear layer of the neural retina. These results suggest that the negative regulator HES-5 may play an important role in neural development."
https://openalex.org/W1496861562,"A gene encoding cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase (ApxI) from pea (Pisum sativum L.) was isolated and its nucleotide sequence determined. By homologous alignment between the ApxI cDNA (Mittler, R., and Zilinskas, B. (1991) FEBS Lett. 289, 257-259) and the genomic clone, positions of introns and exons were determined. The isolated ApxI gene was found to contain 9 introns, the first of which was located within the 5'-untranslated region of the mRNA. Southern blot analysis of pea genomic DNA suggests that in pea cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase is encoded by a single copy gene. Steady state ApxI transcript levels were found to increase in response to several stresses imposed by drought, heat, and application of ethephon, abscisic acid, and the superoxide-generating agent paraquat. Increases in ascorbate peroxidase activity in response to stresses were less marked than changes observed in transcript levels; cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase protein levels measured by immunoblot analysis remained unchanged."
https://openalex.org/W1483926031,"Basal expression of a chimeric gene (pMHO4CAT) consisting of approximately 7 kilobase pairs (kbp) of the 5'-flanking region of the mouse heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) gene fused to the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene is 2- to 10-fold greater than that of an analogous construct containing only 1287 bp of the 5'-flanking region (pMHO1CAT) in transiently transfected cultured cells. The enhancer activity has been localized to a 268-base pair (bp) fragment positioned approximately 4 kilobase pairs upstream of the transcription initiation site. This fragment contains two high affinity protein binding sites, regions A and B, as determined by DNase I protection assays using nuclear protein extracts from rat C6 glioma cells. Both sites include core sequence elements, TGAGTCA (region A) and TGTGTCA (region B), that resemble the consensus binding site, TGA(G/C)TCA, of the Jun/Fos (AP-1) family of transcription factors. Purified, bacterially expressed AP-1 (c-Jun homodimer) specifically binds to both elements, exhibiting greater affinity for the region A motif. The expression of pMHO4CAT, but not of pMHO1CAT, is stimulated by the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), and the 268-bp enhancer fragment confers TPA inducibility and c-Jun/c-Fos transactivation to the heterologous SV40 promoter. These functions are mediated by the AP-1 binding sites as multiple copies of the region A motif also confer TPA induction and c-Jun/c-Fos transactivation upon a heterologous promoter."
https://openalex.org/W1539834786,"The alpha-hemolysin (alpha HL) from Staphylococcus aureus causes the lysis of susceptible cells such as rabbit erythrocytes (rRBCs). Lysis is associated with the formation of a hexameric pore in the plasma membrane. Here we show that truncation mutants of alpha HL missing 2 to 22 N-terminal amino acids form oligomers on the surfaces of rRBCs but fail to lyse the cells. By contrast, mutants missing 3 or 5 amino acids at the C terminus are very inefficient at oligomerization but do lyse rRBCs, albeit extremely slowly. The C-terminal truncation mutants, retarded as monomers on the cell surface, undergo a conformational change in which the protease-sensitive loop located near the midpoint of the polypeptide chain becomes occluded. Judged by this criterion, polypeptides truncated at the N terminus, frozen as nonlytic oligomers, are in a similar conformation. A second proteolytic site near the N terminus of the polypeptide becomes inaccessible in the lytic pore formed by the wild-type polypeptide, supporting the idea that a second conformational change occurs upon pore formation. These findings suggest a pathway for assembly of the lytic pore in which alpha HL first binds to target cells as a monomer, which is converted to a nonlytic oligomeric intermediate before formation of the pore. In keeping with this model, an N-terminal truncation mutant blocks the slow lysis induced by a C-terminal truncation mutant, presumably by diverting the weakly lytic subunits into inactive oligomers."
https://openalex.org/W1681118386,"The rat kidney microsomal epoxygenase catalyzed the asymmetric epoxidation of arachidonic acid to generate as major products: 8(R),9(S)-, 11(R),12(S)- and 14(S),15(R)-epoxyeicosatrienoic acids with optical purities of 97, 88, and 70%, respectively. Inhibition studies utilizing a panel of polyclonal antibodies to several rat liver cytochrome P-450 isoforms, indicated that the renal epoxygenase(s) belongs to the cytochrome P-450 2C gene family. Dietary salt, administered either as a 2-2.5% (w/v) solution in the drinking water or as a modified solid diet containing 8% NaCl (w/w), resulted in marked and selective increases in the renal microsomal epoxygenase activity (416 and 260% of controls, for the liquid and solid forms of NaCl, respectively) with no significant changes in the microsomal omega/omega-1 oxygenase or in the hepatic arachidonic acid monooxygenase reaction. Immunoblotting studies demonstrated that dietary salt induced marked increases in the concentration of a cytochrome P-450 isoform(s) recognized by polyclonal antibodies raised against human liver cytochrome P-450 2C10 or rat liver cytochrome P-450 2C11. Comparisons of the stereochemical selectivity of the induced and non-induced microsomal epoxygenase(s) with that of purified rat liver cytochrome P-450 2C11 suggest that the salt-induced protein(s) is catalytically and structurally different from liver cytochrome P-450 2C11. The in vivo significance of dietary salt in regulating the activities of the kidney endogenous arachidonic acid epoxygenase was established by the demonstration of a salt-induced 10-20-fold increase in the urinary output of epoxygenase metabolites. These results, in conjunction with published evidence demonstrating the potent biological activities of its metabolites, suggest a role for the epoxygenase in the renal response to dietary salt."
https://openalex.org/W2103581484,"Guinea pigs cannot synthesize L-ascorbic acid because of their deficiency in L-gulono-gamma-lactone oxidase, a key enzyme for the biosynthesis of this vitamin in higher animals. In this study we isolated the L-gulono-gamma-lactone oxidase gene of the rat and the homologue of this gene of the guinea pig by screening rat and guinea pig genomic DNA libraries in lambda phage vectors, respectively, using a rat L-gulono-gamma-lactone oxidase cDNA as a probe. Sequencing analysis showed that the amino acid sequence of the rat enzyme is encoded by 12 exons and that all the intron/exon boundaries follow the GT/AG rule. On the other hand, regions corresponding to exons I and V were not identified in the guinea pig L-gulono-gamma-lactone oxidase gene homologue. Other defects found in this gene homologue are a deletion of the nucleotide sequence corresponding to a 3' 84-base pair part of rat exon VI, a 2-base pair deletion in the remaining exon VI-related region, and nonconformance to the GT/AG rule at one of the putative intron/exon boundaries. Furthermore, a large number of mutations were found in the amino acid-coding regions of the guinea pig sequence; more than half of them lead to nonconservative amino acid changes, and there are three stop codons as well. Thus it is clear that the guinea pig homologue of the L-gulono-gamma-lactone oxidase gene exists as a pseudogene that randomly accumulated a large number of mutations without functional constraint since the gene ceased to be active during evolution. On the basis of the neutral theory of evolution, the date of the loss of L-gulono-gamma-lactone oxidase in the ancestors of the guinea pig was roughly calculated to be less than 20 million years ago."
https://openalex.org/W1601491244,"Angiogenin is a 14.4-kDa human plasma protein with 65% homology to RNase A that retains the key active site residues and three of the four RNase A disulfide bonds. We demonstrate that recombinant angiogenin functions as a cytotoxic tRNA-specific RNase in cell-free lysates and when injected into Xenopus oocytes. Inhibition of protein synthesis by angiogenin correlates with degradation of endogenous oocyte tRNA. Exogenous, radiolabeled tRNA is also hydrolyzed by angiogenin, whereas oocyte rRNA and mRNA are not detectably degraded by angiogenin. Protein synthesis was restored to angiogenin-injected oocytes by injecting the RNase inhibitor RNasin plus total Xenopus or calf liver tRNAs, thereby demonstrating that the tRNA degradation induced by angiogenin was the sole cause of cytotoxicity. A similar tRNA-reversible inhibition of protein synthesis was seen in rabbit reticulocyte lysates. Angiogenin therefore appears to be a specific cellular tRNase, whereas five homologues in the RNase A superfamily lack angiogenin's specificity for tRNA. One of these homologues purified from human eosinophils, eosinophil-derived neurotoxin, nonspecifically degrades oocyte RNA similar to RNase A and is also cytotoxic at very low concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W1568624108,"Apoptosis of neutrophils at sites of inflammation in vivo is thought to lead to their recognition and safe elimination by macrophages. Little is known, however, about the regulation of apoptosis in myeloid cells. We report here that the human promonocytic leukemic cell line, U937, and mature human neutrophils can be induced to become apoptotic when cultured with interleukin-6. Apoptosis of U937 cells, assessed morphologically and by the presence of DNA fragmentation, was increased significantly in a dose-dependent fashion by concentrations of 0.5-100 ng/ml interleukin-6. Apoptosis of U937 cells was evident after 48 h of incubation with 20 ng/ml interleukin-6, and the effect was eliminated by adsorption of interleukin-6 with a specific monoclonal antibody. Apoptosis was not evident in the presence of the differentiating agent phorbol 12-myristate 13 acetate; the induction of apoptosis in U937 cells was not therefore a consequence of differentiation. Apoptosis of mature neutrophils was enhanced after 24 h in culture with interleukin-6. Interleukin-6 might be an important factor in the normal resolution of inflammation through the induction of apoptosis of neutrophils."
https://openalex.org/W1511049324,"Comparison of the farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) synthase amino acid sequences from four species with amino acid sequences from the related enzymes hexaprenyl diphosphate synthase and geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase show the presence of two aspartate rich highly conserved domains. The aspartate motif ((I, L, or V)XDDXXD) of the second of those domains has homology with at least 9 prenyl transfer enzymes that utilize an allylic prenyl diphosphate as one substrate. In order to investigate the role of this second aspartate-rich domain in rat FPP synthase, we mutated the first or third aspartate to glutamate, expressed the wild-type and mutant enzymes in Escherichia coli, and purified them to apparent homogeneity using a single chromatographic step. Approximately 12 mg of homogeneous protein was isolated from 120 mg of crude bacterial extract. The kinetic parameters of the purified wild-type recombinant FPP synthase containing the DDYLD motif were as follows: Vmax = 0.84 mumol/min/mg; GPP Km = 1.0 microM; isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) Km = 2.7 microM. Substitution of glutamate for the first aspartate (EDYLD) decreased the Vmax by over 90-fold. The Km for IPP increased, whereas the Km for GPP remained the same in this D243E mutant. Substitution of glutamate for the third aspartate (DDYLE) did not result in altered enzyme kinetics in the D247E mutant. These results suggest that the first aspartate in the second domain is involved in the catalysis by FPP synthase."
https://openalex.org/W1521219614,"Visual arrestin plays an important role in regulating light responsiveness via its ability to specifically bind to the phosphorylated and light-activated form of rhodopsin. To further characterize rhodopsin/arrestin interactions we have utilized a rabbit reticulocyte lysate translation system to synthesize bovine visual arrestin. The translated arrestin (404 amino acids) was demonstrated to be fully functional in terms of its ability to specifically recognize and bind to phosphorylated light-activated rhodopsin (P-Rh*). Competitive binding studies revealed that the in vitro synthesized arrestin and purified bovine visual arrestin had comparable affinities for P-Rh*. In an effort to assess the functional role of different regions of the arrestin molecule, two truncated arrestin mutants were produced by cutting within the open reading frame of the bovine arrestin cDNA with selective restriction enzymes. In vitro translation of the transcribed truncated mRNAs resulted in the production of arrestins truncated from the carboxyl terminus. The ability of each of the mutant arrestins to bind to dark (Rh), light-activated (Rh*), dark phosphorylated (P-Rh), and light-activated phosphorylated rhodopsin were then compared. Arrestin lacking 39 carboxyl-terminal residues binds specifically not only to P-Rh* but also to Rh* and P-Rh. This suggests that the carboxyl-terminal domain of arrestin plays an important regulatory role in ensuring strict arrestin binding selectivity to P-Rh*. Arrestin that has only the first 191 amino-terminal residues predominately discriminates the phosphorylation state of the rhodopsin; however, it also retains some binding specificity for the activation state. These results suggest that the amino-terminal half of arrestin contains key rhodopsin recognition sites responsible for interaction with both the phosphorylated and light-activated forms of rhodopsin."
https://openalex.org/W1523242007,"The mechanism by which an agonist, binding to a cell surface receptor, exerts an effect on events in the nucleus is not known. We have previously shown (Leach, K. L., Ruff, V. A., Wright, T. M., Pessin, M. S., and Raben, D. M. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 3215-3221) that alpha-thrombin treatment of IIC9 cells results in increased levels of cellular 1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG) and activation of protein kinase C (PKC). Here, we have examined whether changes in nuclear PKC and nuclear DAG also are induced following alpha-thrombin treatment. IIC9 cells were treated with 500 ng/ml alpha-thrombin, and nuclei were then isolated. Western blot analysis using isozyme-specific antibodies demonstrated the presence of PKC alpha, but not PKC epsilon or zeta in the nuclei of cells treated with either phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or alpha-thrombin. The increase in nuclear PKC alpha levels was accompanied by a 10-fold increase in nuclear PKC specific activity and stimulated phosphorylation of at least six nuclear proteins. The rise in nuclear PKC levels occurred rapidly and reached a maximum at 30-60 s, which was followed by a decline back to the control level over the next 15 min. In addition, alpha-thrombin treatment resulted in an immediate rise in DAG mass levels in the nuclear fractions. Kinetic analysis indicated that a maximum increase in DAG levels occurred 2.5-5 min after the addition of alpha-thrombin and remained elevated for at least 30 min. In cells labeled with [3H]myristic acid, alpha-thrombin treatment induced an increase in radiolabeled nuclear diglycerides, suggesting that the stimulated nuclear DAGs are derived, at least in part, from phosphatidylcholine. Our results suggest that increases in both nuclear DAG levels and PKC activity following alpha-thrombin treatment may play a role in mediating thrombin-induced nuclear responses such as changes in gene expression and cellular proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W1589751286,"Apolipoproteins A-I and A-II comprise approximately 70 and 20%, respectively, of the total protein content of HDL. Evidence suggests that apoA-I plays a central role in determining the structure and plasma concentration of HDL, while the role of apoA-II is uncertain. To help define the function of apoA-II and determine what effect increasing its plasma concentration has on HDL, transgenic mice expressing human apoA-II and both human apoA-I and human apoA-II were produced. Human apoA-II mRNA is expressed exclusively in the livers of transgenic animals, and the protein exists as a dimer as it does in humans. High level expression of human apoA-II did not increase HDL concentrations or decrease plasma concentrations of murine apoA-I and apoA-II in contrast to what was observed in mice overexpressing human apoA-I. The primary effect of overexpressing human apoA-II was the appearance of small HDL particles composed exclusively of human apoA-II. HDL from mice transgenic for both human apoA-I and human apoA-II displayed a unique size distribution when compared with either apoA-I or apoA-II transgenic mice and contain particles with both these human apolipoproteins. These results in mice, indicating that human apoA-II participates in determining HDL size, parallel results from human studies."
https://openalex.org/W1628991398,"The receptors for interleukin-3 (IL-3) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) consist of two polypeptides each belonging to a new class of molecules referred to as the hemopoietin receptor family. When expressed alone, receptor polypeptides of this family often bind their respective factors with lower affinity than the receptors identified in whole cells. Despite the lack of structural evidence for any enzymatic activity of the receptor polypeptides, both IL-3 and GM-CSF stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple intracellular substrates. We investigated IL-3 and GM-CSF receptor structure and signaling in a myeloid cell line, FDC-P1, which is dependent on either IL-3 or GM-CSF for growth. Antiphosphotyrosine antibodies were used to immunoprecipitate tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins from 32P-labeled cells or to probe immunoblots. Both IL-3 and GM-CSF stimulated the phosphorylation of a similar pattern of polypeptides on tyrosine. One tyrosine phosphorylated polypeptide migrated with M(r) = 135,000 and increased to 150,000 over a period of 10 min following stimulation of cells with IL-3 or GM-CSF. The M(r) = 135,000-150,000 polypeptide phosphorylated in response to IL-3 was shown to be primarily the Aic-2A polypeptide, the low affinity IL-3 receptor. Phosphatase treatment showed that the dramatic IL-3-induced shift in apparent molecular weight from M(r) = 125,000 in unstimulated cells was entirely due to phosphorylation. The closely related receptor, Aic-2B, was also tyrosine phosphorylated in response to IL-3, although to a lesser extent than Aic-2A. Treatment with GM-CSF resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of the Aic-2B polypeptide exclusively. It was intriguing that GM-CSF treatment did affect the mobility of the Aic-2A polypeptide on polyacrylamide gels. Together, these results suggest that the Aic-2A polypeptide is part of the IL-3 receptor complex, but not the GM-CSF receptor. In contrast, the Aic-2B polypeptide is a component of the GM-CSF receptor, but it can also be utilized in an IL-3 receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1636545901,"A cDNA coding for the lysosomal aspartic protease from the mosquito (mLAP) was cloned and sequenced. The mLAP cDNA is 1420 base pairs long with an open reading frame of 387 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence contains a signal pre-propeptide sequence of 18 amino acids followed by 369 amino acids with a 35-amino acid putative pro-enzyme domain in the NH2-terminal. The amino acid sequence of mLAP is 92 and 81% similar to human cathepsin D and cathepsin E, respectively. Typical cleavage sites for cathepsin D processing into light and heavy chains are lacking in mLAP. A single glycosylation site occurs in the mLAP sequence at a position corresponding to the first glycosylation site of cathepsins D. The mLAP sequence shares putative phosphorylation determinants, which in cathepsins D are linked to the formation of mannose 6-phosphate. In the mosquito fat body, lysosomal enzymes specifically degrade organelles involved in the biosynthesis and secretion of vitellogenin. The mLAP mRNA accumulates to its highest level 24 h after initiation of vitellogenin synthesis and 12 h before the peak of mLAP protein accumulation and its enzymatic activity. Translational regulation of mLAP mRNA may occur. The 5'-untranslated region of mLAP mRNA is similar to elements conferring negative translational control by steroids."
https://openalex.org/W1575016271,"A specific inhibitor of DNA polymerase alpha was isolated from the lipid fraction prepared from myxoamoebae of a true slime mold, Physarum polycephalum. The purified substance was subjected to structural studies by fast atom bombardment mass spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The structure of this substance was thereby suggested to be a novel lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) composed of cyclic phosphate and cyclopropane-containing hexadecanoic acid. Then we named this substance PHYLPA (Physarum LPA). PHYLPA inhibited more than 80% of the affinity-purified calf thymus DNA polymerase alpha activity at a concentration of 10 micrograms/ml (approximately 20 microM). Inhibition was observed for DNA polymerase alpha but not for DNA polymerase beta or gamma from various eukaryotic species, nor did it inhibit DNA polymerase I from E. coli. From kinetic analyses, the inhibition was considered to be caused by the interaction of PHYLPA with the template DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1528915146,"The mRNA encoding S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (AdoMetDC) has an unusual distribution in polysomes from cells of T lymphocyte origin. It associates predominantly with monosomes and small polysomes with none located in the preribosomal or ribonucleoprotein pool. In sharp contrast, it associates broadly with larger polysomes in several nonlymphoid cell lines, including fibroblasts and the adrenal carcinoma line, Y1. The AdoMetDC 5'-transcript leader (5'-TL) is highly conserved between human and bovine mRNAs. It has a length of about 330 nucleotides and contains a 21-nucleotide upstream open reading frame (uORF) approximately 14 nucleotides downstream of the cap site. The AdoMetDC 5'-TL, when used to replace the 5'-TL of the human growth hormone gene in a chimeric expression construct, causes a suppressed polysomal distribution of the chimeric mRNA identical to that of the endogenous AdoMetDC mRNA in the T cell line, Jurkat. In contrast, mRNA encoded by the same chimeric construct, when expressed in Y1 cells, mimics the broad polysomal distribution of the endogenous AdoMetDC mRNA. Mutations that remove the uORF, or prevent its initiation, abolish the translational suppression in T cells, establishing that the uORF is a negative element that modulates the cell-specific polysomal distribution of AdoMetDC mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1599629122,"Transcription of the corynebacteriophage diphtheria tox operon has been shown to be regulated through a corynebacterial determined factor DtxR. The dtxR gene has been recently cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli, and shown to regulate the expression of beta-galactosidase expression from a diphtheria tox promoter/operator-lacZ transcriptional fusion. Tao et al. (Tao, X., Boyd, J., and Murphy, J. R. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 89, 5897-5901) have recently shown by gel mobility shift assay that the binding of DtxR to the tox operator requires a divalent heavy metal ion, as well as the 27-base pair interrupted palindromic sequence. We now show the activation of DtxR in the presence of Co2+, Fe2+, or Mn2+ results in the protection of a 33- and 27-nucleotide region on the coding and non-coding strand from DNase I digestion, respectively. DtxR is also activated in the presence of Ni2+; however, this metalloregulatory factor is only weakly activated by Zn2+. The diphtheria tox regulatory region protected from DNase I digestion in the presence of activated DtxR encompasses the 27-base pair interrupted palindromic sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1553885547,"The chloroplastic enzyme NADP-malate dehydrogenase is activated by a reversible thiol/disulfide interchange with reduced thioredoxin. Its target disulfide bridge is considered to be located at the amino terminus. To further substantiate the regulatory role of this disulfide, site-directed mutagenesis has been used to replace each or both of the amino-terminal cysteines of the sorghum leaf NADP-malate dehydrogenase, expressed in Escherichia coli, by serines. A truncation mutant lacking the amino terminus has also been produced. Surprisingly, the mutant proteins still required activation by reduced thioredoxin. However, their activation was almost instantaneous, whereas the native enzyme reached full activity after a 10-20 min preincubation. The 8 1/2 for reduced thioredoxin was decreased 2-fold in the mutants, but their Km values for NADPH and oxaloacetate did not change significantly. The inhibition of activation by NADP and inhibition of activity by thiol-derivatizing agents were also retained. These results are interpreted as an indication that two thioredoxin-dependent reduction steps are involved in NADP-dependent malate dehydrogenase light activation, hence that two disulfides per monomer participate in the process. The overall activation rate would depend on a conformational change following the reduction of the amino-terminal disulfide bridge. The amino terminus also plays a role in the dimerization of the protein."
https://openalex.org/W1598918214,"The osteogenic disorder Shionogi (ODS) rat is a mutant Wistar rat that is subject to scurvy, because it lacks L-gulono-gamma-lactone oxidase, a key enzyme in L-ascorbic acid biosynthesis. Sequencing of polymerase chain reaction-amplified cDNAs for mutant and normal rat L-gulono-gamma-lactone oxidases demonstrated that the mutant cDNA has a single base mutation from G to A at nucleotide 182, which mutation alters the 61st amino acid residue from Cys to Tyr. To test the effect of this mutation on the expression of L-gulono-gamma-lactone oxidase, we inserted a region of the cDNAs coding for normal and mutant L-gulono-gamma-lactone oxidases into an expression vector, pSVL, and transfected COS-1 cells with such vectors. The result indicated that the defined amino acid substitution does decrease both the amount of immunologically detectable protein and the level of enzyme activity to about one-tenth of their normal values, while it does not affect the amount of the mRNA produced in the transfected cells. This situation is similar to our previous observation that L-gulono-gamma-lactone oxidase is expressed in the liver of the ODS rat at a very low level irrespective of the presence of a normal amount of L-gulono-gamma-lactone oxidase-specific mRNA of a normal size (Nishikimi, M., Koshizaka, T., Kondo, K., and Yagi, K. (1989) Experientia (Basel) 45, 126-129). Thus it became clear that the Cys-->Tyr substitution is responsible for the L-gulono-gamma-lactone oxidase deficiency in the ODS rat."
https://openalex.org/W1531694665,"GP180 is one of the major transmembrane glycoproteins in mouse T-lymphoma cells. This molecule is an isoform of CD45 and is known to contain an intrinsic protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) activity. Using several complementary biochemical techniques, we have found that fodrin (a spectrin-like protein) is preferentially co-isolated with CD45 (GP180), suggesting that a complex between CD45 (GP180) and the cytoskeleton exists in mouse T-lymphoma cells. Furthermore, we have determined that this CD45 (GP180)-fodrin complex is dissociated by high salt treatment. Using in vitro binding assays, we have shown that CD45 (GP180) binds directly and specifically to fodrin (Kd approximately 1.1 nM) or spectrin (Kd approximately 3.2 nM) in a saturable manner. Additional analyses indicate that a 48-kDa phosphopeptide of CD45 (GP180) contains the fodrin/spectrin-binding domain. Most importantly, the direct binding of fodrin/spectrin to CD45 (GP180) is found to significantly stimulate the PTPase activity of CD45. Enzyme kinetic analysis indicates that fodrin and spectrin increase the Vmax of CD45 (GP180)-mediated dephosphorylation by 7.5 and 3.2-fold, respectively, without significantly changing the Km value. These results strongly suggest that the cytoskeletal proteins, fodrin and spectrin, play an important role in the regulation of the CD45 (GP180) PTPase activity during lymphocyte activation."

The molecular mass was estimated to be 850 kDa by gel filtration. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the proteasome gave a single protein band under nondenaturing conditions and at least 10 bands in the range of 21-32 kDa in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. By electron microscopy after negative staining with uranyl acetate, the proteasome from spinach appeared as symmetrical ring-shaped particles. The substrate specificity of proteasomes indicates that they contain at least three types of activity, namely, chymotrypsin-like, Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease-like, and trypsin-like activities. The former two activities were enhanced by poly-L-lysine or sodium dodecyl sulfate. Moreover, we examined the immunological reactivities of proteasomes from various eukaryotes. As a result, cross-immunoreactivities of some subunits were observed. These properties of the proteasome are similar to those of proteasomes isolated from various other eukaryotic sources."
https://openalex.org/W1532897280,"The imidazoline-guanidinium receptive site (IGRS) is a membrane-bound protein that may mediate some of the pharmacological effects of imidazoline and guanidinium compounds. The structure and functionality of this protein are unknown but, in addition to its location at the plasma membrane, it is found in high density in the outer membrane of mitochondria (Tesson, F., Prip-Buus, C., Lemoine, A., Pegorier, J.-P., and Parini, A. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 155-160). Using a two-step procedure, we report the purification of mitochondrial IGRS from rabbit kidney to the apparent homogeneity. After solubilization of mitochondrial membranes with digitonin, an apparently homogeneous IGRS preparation was obtained by two sequential purification steps, chromatofocusing and hydroxylapatite-agarose chromatography. One- and two-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of the purified preparation after silver staining or radioiodination indicated that IGRS binding subunit was purified at the apparent homogeneity since a single band (M(r) approximately 60,000) was observed. IGRS behaves as an acidic protein (pI 5.5) whose binding activity is regulated by H+ concentration near a physiological pH of 7.4. The ability to achieve rapid purification of IGRS should facilitate efforts to define molecular properties and functionality of this protein."
https://openalex.org/W1491225188,"Activation of protein kinase C (PKC) by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) was compared with calcium/phosphatidylserine (Ca/PS). The substrate specificity of PKC was more limited with PS/PMA. Substrates could be divided into three overlapping groups according to their relative level of phosphorylation: C1, relatively preferred substrates with Ca/PS, included dephosphin, histone, and peptide GS1-10. C2, relatively preferred with PS/PMA, included myelin basic protein and MARCKS. C3, substrates independent of activators. PS/PMA altered the Vmax of PKC for substrate, and decreased the Km for Mg2+. Differential substrate phosphorylation by PS/PMA also occurred for PKC isozymes resolved by hydroxylapatite chromatography and was most dramatic for PKC-alpha, which could no longer phosphorylate histone or GS1-12. Differential activities of PKC were also observed in synaptosol and in intact synaptosomes where PMA stimulated phosphorylation of MARCKS, but not dephosphin. It was further shown that dephosphin was indeed a substrate of PKC in the intact synaptosomes by use of a repolarization-dependent dephosphin phosphorylation assay. The differential PKC activities could also be distinguished by inhibitors. H-7 was equipotent, palmitoylcarnitine did not inhibit in vitro C2 phosphorylation, but inhibited dephosphin in intact synaptosomes, and sphingosine did not inhibit C1 substrates and was without effect on dephosphin in intact synaptosomes. Therefore PS/PMA alters or limits the substrate specificity of PKC, leading to a differential substrate phosphorylation in vitro and in intact synaptosomes and differential inhibitor sensitivity. The pattern of protein phosphorylation observed after PKC activation in intact cells will therefore be dependent upon the activator."
https://openalex.org/W1499054077,"Abstract Fibrinogen chains are assembled in a stepwise manner in the rough endoplasmic reticulum prior to secretion of the final six-chain dimeric molecule. Previous studies indicated that the synthesis of B beta may be a rate-limiting factor in the assembly of human fibrinogen. To determine the domains of B beta which interact with the other two component chains of fibrinogen, deletion mutants of B beta were transiently co-expressed, together with A alpha and gamma chains, in COS cells, and fibrinogen assembly and secretion were measured. Deletion of the COOH-terminal half of the B beta chain (amino acids 208-461) did not affect assembly and secretion. Assembly of A alpha, gamma, and B beta also occurred when the first NH2-terminal 72 amino acids of B beta were deleted, but not when 93 amino acids were deleted. This indicates that the B beta domain between amino acids 73 and 93 is necessary for the assembly of the three fibrinogen chains. This domain marks the start of the alpha-helical coiled-coil region of fibrinogen."
https://openalex.org/W1543613663,"Investigations of human red blood cells show that a cytoplasmic protein called calpromotin is involved in the regulation of calcium-activated potassium transport. Calpromotin associates with the membrane in the presence of calcium and undergoes a chemical transformation. High performance gel filtration and gel electrophoresis show that the cytoplasmic and membrane-bound calpromotin can exist in both low and high molecular weight forms. The biochemical properties of the high molecular weight membrane-bound calpromotin are not the same as the high molecular weight cytoplasmic calpromotin. The high molecular weight membrane forms of calpromotin are increased by leupeptin and diminished by iodoacetic acid. Therefore, the leupeptin enhancement and iodoacetic inhibition of calcium-activated potassium transport may involve the high molecular weight forms of membrane-bound calpromotin."
https://openalex.org/W1536378179,"Abstract Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) is a potent regulator of postnatal growth in mammals, yet little is known about the developmental control of IGF-I synthesis. We have investigated the regulation of IGF-I expression in the rat in order to gain insight into the mechanisms of growth factor induction during early postnatal life. Steady-state levels of liver IGF-I mRNA increased by more than 15-fold during the period from fetal day 18 to postnatal day 7 and reached 50% of adult values by day 14. Transcription run-on experiments using isolated hepatic nuclei and direct analysis of nuclear RNA each demonstrated a comparable rise in nascent IGF-I mRNA over the same time period. Over 90% of transcripts were directed by promoter 1, the more 5' of the two IGF-I gene promoters. By contrast IGF-II gene transcription rates and mRNA levels fell during the first 3 weeks after birth, and albumin expression rose slightly. Analysis of chromatin structure around the IGF-I gene revealed 15 DNase I-hypersensitive sites in adult rat liver in the 120 kilobases (kb) comprising the 6 exon gene and its flanking regions (8 sites within 10 kb at the 5'-end including exons 1-3, 5 sites in the 50-kb third intron, and 2 sites in the 15-kb fifth intron). During development there was a progressive appearance of DNase I-hypersensitive sites that coincided with activation of IGF-I gene expression. One site that became fully hypersensitive by postnatal day 7 was mapped by in vivo DNAse I footprinting to the proximal 200 nucleotides of promoter 1. Since serum IGF-I values rose from 10 to 120 micrograms/liter during the initial postnatal week, these results indicate that transcriptional mechanisms are principally responsible for the stimulation of IGF-I synthesis that occurs shortly after birth. Because discrete changes in chromatin organization coincided with induction of IGF-I gene transcription, it is likely that a series of developmentally modulated transcription factors are involved the activation process."
https://openalex.org/W1523322278,"The M protein of mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 is a triple-spanning membrane protein which assembles with an uncleaved internal signal sequence, adopting an NexoCcyt orientation. To study the insertion mechanism of this protein, domains potentially involved in topogenesis were deleted and the effects analyzed in topogenesis were deleted and the effects analyzed in several ways. Mutant proteins were synthesized in a cell-free translation system in the presence of microsomal membranes, and their integration and topology were determined by alkaline extraction and by protease-protection experiments. By expression in COS-1 and Madin-Darby canine kidney-II cells, the topology of the mutant proteins was also analyzed in vivo. Glycosylation was used as a biochemical marker to assess the disposition of the NH2 terminus. An indirect immunofluorescence assay on semi-intact Madin-Darby canine kidney-II cells using domain-specific antibodies served to identify the cytoplasmically exposed domains. The results show that each membrane-spanning domain acts independently as an insertion and anchor signal and adopts an intrinsic preferred orientation in the lipid bilayer which corresponds to the disposition of the transmembrane domain in the wild-type assembled protein. These observations provide further insight into the mechanism of membrane integration of multispanning proteins. A model for the insertion of the coronavirus M protein is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1572272503,"Rex protein, the posttranscriptional regulator of human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I), is required for the control of viral structural protein expression and virus replication. Rex is a phosphoprotein found predominantly in the cell nucleolus, whose function is thought to be regulated by its nucleolar localization and phosphorylation. Therefore, we investigated the in vivo phosphorylation of Rex protein in more detail. Phosphorylation of Rex occurred in all HTLV-I-infected cell lines examined in vivo, primarily at serine residues and to a very small extent at threonine residues. Treatment of cells with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) led to significant but transient enhancement of the incorporation of [32P]orthophosphate into Rex protein. N-terminal truncation of Rex protein abolished TPA-dependent phosphorylation. Chymotryptic digestion of phosphorylated Rex yielded two phosphopeptides. In vivo phosphorylation sites were identified as serine residues 70 and 177 and threonine residue 174. Serine 70 was a TPA-dependent phosphorylation site within a regulatory domain. We have already shown that the protein kinase C inhibitor H-7 (1-(5-isoquinolinylsulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine) specifically blocked accumulation of viral unspliced gag-pol mRNA. Therefore, the phosphorylation at serine 70 may be involved in the regulation of Rex function in response to extracellular stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W1541928891,"We have isolated a gene from Saccharomyces cerevisiae that encodes a protein homologous to the mammalian cysteine proteinase bleomycin hydrolase. Sequence comparison between the yeast and rabbit proteins indicates an amino acid identity of 41.5% over 277 residues and a similarity of 78.3% when conservative substitutions are included. The apparent mass of the yeast protein by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis is 47 kDa, although sequence analysis indicates two potential initiator methionines that suggest calculated masses of either 51 or 55 kDa. The protein is nonessential in yeast as haploid mutants disrupted at several positions along the open reading frame remain viable. Furthermore, these mutants do not exhibit any readily observable growth defects under varying conditions of temperature, nutrients, osmotic strength, or exogenous bleomycin. However, the purified protein does exhibit marked hydrolytic activity toward the substrate arginine 4-methyl-7-coumarylamide (Km = 12.8 microM, Vmax = 2.56 mumol mg-1 h-1), and yeast cells engineered to express this protein at higher levels maintain increased resistance to bleomycin compared to wild-type cells. Because this protein represents the first example of a cysteine proteinase identified in yeast, we have named it Ycp1 (yeast cysteine proteinase)."
https://openalex.org/W1489418293,"The propeptides of lysosomal enzymes have been implicated in membrane association and mannose 6-phosphate-independent sorting to the lysosome (Rijnboutt, S., Aerts, H., Geuze, H. J., Tager, J. M., and Strous, G. J. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 4862-4868; McIntyre, G. F., and Erickson, A. H. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 15438-15445). In this report, the function of the propeptide of procathepsin D in sorting to the lysosome was directly assessed using a cathepsin D deletion mutant lacking the propeptide, and using a chimeric cDNA encoding the cathepsin D propeptide fused to the secretory protein alpha-lactalbumin. Proteins encoded by these cDNAs were expressed in mouse Ltk- cells and in human hepatoma Hep G2 cells, and then immunoprecipitated and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The deletion mutant was glycosylated but was rapidly degraded in a chloroquine-independent fashion and did not assume an active conformation. Thus the propeptide appeared to be necessary for correct folding. The chimeric protein was glycosylated and secreted. The coincidence of complex oligosaccharide modification and secretion of the chimeric protein suggested that it was slowly released from the endoplasmic reticulum and rapidly passed through the cell to the extracellular compartment. This was confirmed by immunofluorescent localization of the proteins. The data indicated that the propeptide appeared to be necessary for folding of cathepsin D but, unlike the yeast vacuolar propeptides, was not sufficient to direct a secretory protein to the lysosome in fibroblasts or in epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W1555426361,"The cellular actions of nerve growth factor (NGF) involve changes in protein phosphorylation, initiated by the binding and subsequent activation of its tyrosine kinase receptor, the trk protooncogene (pp140c-trk). Upon exposure to NGF, a 38-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein (pp38) is identified in both PC-12 pheochromocytoma cells and NIH3T3 cells transfected with the full-length human pp140c-trk cDNA (3T3-c-trk) that is specifically coimmunoprecipitated with pp140c-trk or phosphatidylinositol-phospholipase C (PLC)-gamma 1. In both PC-12 and 3T3-c-trk cells, NGF rapidly stimulates the association of pp140c-trk and pp38 with a fusion protein containing the src homology (SH) domains of PLC gamma 1. This phosphorylation and subsequent association are specific for NGF, since epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and insulin do not stimulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins or their association with the PLC gamma 1 SH domains, although the receptors for these growth factors do undergo tyrosine phosphorylation and association with the PLC-gamma 1 fusion protein under these conditions. Furthermore, the NGF-dependent pp38-SH binding is specific for the SH2 domains of PLC-gamma 1, since the phosphoprotein does not bind to fusion proteins containing SH domains of ras GTPase-activating protein or the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase. Both amino- and carboxyl-terminal SH2 domains of PLC-gamma 1 are necessary for the association of pp38 with PLC-gamma 1, although each SH2 domain is sufficient for the association of pp140c-trk with PLC-gamma 1. In both PC-12 and 3T3-c-trk cells, the phosphorylation and association of pp38 with PLC gamma 1 is rapid, occurring maximally at 1 min and declining thereafter. Moreover, this effect of NGF is dose-dependent over a physiological concentration of the growth factor. The specificity and rapidity of pp38 phosphorylation and its association with PLC-gamma 1 suggest that it may be an important component in signal transduction for NGF."

Amino acid sequence analysis showed PAR 1 and PAR 2 to be two distinct polypeptides. Antibodies specific against either PAR 1 or PAR 2 were shown to each react with a distinct band in Western blots of paraflagellar isolates of T. cruzi and other trypanosomatids if rigorous protease inhibition was used. The PAR 2 message was isolated and characterized by Northern blot and nucleic acid sequence analysis. Preliminary analysis of the PAR 2 gene indicates that PAR 2 is a member of a multigene family with all members residing on a single chromosome."
https://openalex.org/W1587112517,"Polyclonal antibodies were raised against the nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBMPR)-sensitive nucleoside transporter of human erythrocyte membranes. On Western blots of these membranes they labeled the broad region (average apparent M(r) 55,000), which contains both the nucleoside and glucose transport proteins. However, they did not recognize the glucose transporter when this was prepared free of nucleoside transporter by expression from a cDNA clone. Their specificity for the nucleoside transporter was confirmed by the ability to immunoadsorb NBMPR- but not cytochalasin B-binding sites from a detergent-solubilized mixture of band 4.5 proteins. Although a large proportion of the antibodies recognized extracellular epitopes, these appeared to be located primarily on the polypeptide moiety of the glycoprotein, as demonstrated by the ability of the antibodies strongly to label the deglycosylated transporter (apparent M(r) 45,000) on Western blots. The antibodies were species-cross-reactive, recognizing nucleoside transporters from pig and rabbit erythrocytes and from rat liver. The pig protein is similar to the human transporter in its inhibitor sensitivity but is considerably larger (apparent M(r) 57,000 after deglycosylation). In contrast, the rat protein is similar in size to the human transporter (apparent M(r) 45,000 after deglycosylation) but much less sensitive to the inhibitors dilazep and dipyridamole. These findings indicate that despite their differences in size and inhibitor specificity, the NBMPR-sensitive nucleoside transporters of these mammalian species are related in amino acid sequence."

The sample isolated from liver DNA was also identified by UV spectroscopy at different pH values and by mass spectrometry. The estimated yields of C8-methylguanine obtained in hydrolysates of DNA from the liver or colon tissue were comparable to those of O6-methylguanine. C8-Methylguanine was not detected when the spin trap alpha-(4-pyridyl-1-oxide)-N-tert- butylnitrone was administered together with 1,2-dimethylhydrazine. The spin trap also inhibited N7-methylguanine and O6-methylguanine yields, although to a lesser extent.

https://openalex.org/W1566474800,"Protein kinase N (PKN) is a protein kinase rapidly activated by nerve growth factor (NGF) and other agents in PC12 pheochromocytoma and additional cell types. PKN is selectively inhibited by purine analogs, and this property has served both as a diagnostic for PKN activity and to establish its apparent involvement in certain pathways of the NGF mechanism of action. The present work has focused on further characterization, identification, and purification of NGF-activated PKN. We show here that PKN can be substantially enriched by elution from ion exchange resins with ATP. We exploited this novel technique (nucleotide affinity exchange chromatography) to devise two alternative isolation schemes for PKN. One utilizes sequential chromatographic steps and provides a preparation that is apparently 60% homogeneous for PKN and represents a total enrichment of approximately 10,000-fold. The other is a single column procedure and includes prewashes with NAD. This method yields material that is about 5-10% homogeneous for PKN, requires about 1 h, and can be applied to multiple samples in parallel. The ATP elution technique furthermore distinguishes NGF-regulated from basal PKN activity and thereby suggests the presence of distinct PKN isoforms. The applications of sucrose gradient centrifugation, gel filtration chromatography, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)/silver staining, affinity labeling with 8-azido-ATP/SDS-PAGE, and autophosphorylation (after SDS-PAGE, blotting and renaturation) all indicate that PKN has an apparent molecular mass of 45-47 kDa and is mainly monomeric in solution. These and additional properties appear to distinguish PKN from many previously described protein kinases."

Chem. 267, 16990-16994). In this study, we used a fluoride-specific electrode to determine that the amount of tightly bound fluoride in the complex was 9.4 +/- 2 nmol mg-1 SR protein. The rate constant of inactivation was very similar to the rate constant of fluoride incorporation and varied directly as the square of the fluoride concentration. Luminal Ca2+ accelerated reactivation of the inhibited enzyme, and the rate constants of activity regain and fluoride release were very similar. Although required for inhibition, added magnesium did not accelerate reactivation. Analysis for magnesium using antipyrylazo III of the inhibited enzyme showed 4.1 +/- 0.4 nmol mg-1 SR protein. As there is much evidence in the literature supportive of an estimate of calcium pumps equal to approximately 4-5 nmol mg-1 SR protein, our results indicate that each inhibited enzyme contains two tightly bound fluorides and one tightly bound magnesium."
https://openalex.org/W1595881985,"Endocrine and exocrine cells exhibit both a constitutive and a regulated secretory pathway. In the latter pathway, secretory are stored at a high concentration in secretory granules and are released by exocytosis in response to appropriate external stimuli. Sorting between the two secretory pathways is believed to take place in the trans-Golgi tubular network. To account for experimental data, it has been proposed that sorting receptors exist which bind a variety of regulated secretory proteins, including foreign secretory introduced into the cells by transfection. In support of the sorting receptor hypothesis Chung et al. (Chung, K.-N., Walter, P., Aponte, G. W., and Moore, H.-P.H. (1989) Science 243, 192-197) isolated a group of 25-kDa canine pancreatic hormone-binding proteins that bound regulated but not constitutive secretory proteins. To determine if similar are present in other species and tissues, we have screened porcine pancreas, parathyroid, adrenal medulla, and pituitary glands. A 31-kDa protein, similar to that identified by Chung et al. (1989), which binds to regulated but not to constitutive secretory was identified in porcine pancreas. This protein was not detected in the parathyroid, adrenal medulla, or pituitary glands, however, which argues against it serving as a general sorting receptor. NH2-terminal sequencing, immunoreactivity, and proteolytic activity data indicate that the porcine 31-kDa protein is similar if not identical to porcine chymotrypsinogen A or B."
https://openalex.org/W1605116095,"The interaction between eukaryotic elongation factor eEF-2 and reconstituted 80 S ribosomes was investigated by analyzing the accessibility of 5 S ribosomal RNA for chemical and enzymatic modification. Ribosomes reconstituted from derived subunits were modified, and the positions of the modified sites were identified by primer extension using a 5 S rRNA-specific probe. All reactive sites were located between nucleotides 38 and 99, and most of them were found in putative single-stranded regions of the 5 S rRNA. Conversion of the ribosomes to the post-translocation type of particles by treatment with the translational inhibitor ricin resulted in the exposure of 3 additional bases for chemical modification, suggesting that the 5 S rRNA was more exposed in this type of ribosome. After binding of eEF-2 in complex with the non-hydrolyzable GTP analogue guanosine 5'-(beta, gamma-methylene)-triphosphate, most of the exposed bases in the 5 S rRNA were protected against both chemical and enzymatic modification."
https://openalex.org/W1507307257,"To probe the functional role of tryptophan 49 in human antithrombin III, a mutant antithrombin, W49K, has been expressed in baby hamster kidney cells. The mutation reduces the affinity for heparin pentasaccharide by 1.8 kcal mol-1 but does not alter the heparin enhancement of the rate of factor Xa inhibition. 1H NMR spectra of W49K antithrombin show that the structure of the protein and the mode of heparin binding appear to be unaltered by the mutation, although tryptophan 49 is perturbed by heparin binding. 19F NMR spectra of 6-fluorotryptophan-substituted antithrombin show that tryptophan 49 is in a solvent-exposed environment. The heparin-induced fluorescence enhancement of W49K antithrombin is significantly different from that of wild-type antithrombin. Pentasaccharide induces only a 24% enhancement of antithrombin fluorescence, while high affinity heparin induces an enhancement of 40%. The results indicate that tryptophan 49 is probably a heparin contact residue but can be mutated without altering the remaining heparin-antithrombin interactions or the heparin-induced conformational change and resultant activation toward Factor Xa. Hydrophobic as well as charge interactions are thus probably involved in the specificity of the antithrombin-heparin pentasaccharide interaction. The lower fluorescence enhancements suggest that the heparin-induced 40% fluorescence enhancement used as the hallmark of activating heparin species is not the best indicator of the structural change in antithrombin that results in enhancement of the rate of proteinase inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W1581822626,"Abstract In this report we demonstrate that a transcriptional regulatory element for one gene lies within a second, seemingly unrelated gene. Specifically, the 3' portion of the murine sex-limited protein (slp) gene, located within the class III region of the major histocompatibility complex, contains an element that regulates expression of the linked steroid 21-hydroxylase gene. A 4.2-kilobase (kb) major histocompatibility complex region, located between -2.2 and -6.4 kb upstream of 21OH-A, is required for expression of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene in transgenic mice. Two short regions of DNA, located between -5.3 and -6.0 kb, stimulate chloramphenicol acetyltransferase expression in Y1 adrenocortical tumor cells, and both of these active regions lie within the slp gene. A 21-base pair sequence, which is required for activity of the most 3' region, does not contain any of over 100 previously identified transcriptional regulatory elements. This juxtaposition of structural and regulatory elements of otherwise unrelated genes suggests a mechanism by which the evolutionarily conserved genetic linkage of 21OH-A and slp (or the homologous complement component C4) might provide a selective advantage. Analogous genetic arrangements may explain other examples of conserved linkage of disparate genes."
https://openalex.org/W1581821437,"Abstract The molecular regulation of apolipoprotein E (apoE) synthesis and secretion is incompletely understood. In this study, we have examined the effect of human low density lipoprotein (LDL) on apoE mRNA and protein levels in HepG2 and other eukaryotic cells. Exposing HepG2 cells to LDL for times up to 4 h resulted in an increase in 35S-labeled apoE accumulation in the medium by 2.2-fold, relative to serum free controls (n = 10, p < 0.001), with no changes in apoE mRNA levels. Similar observations have been made in JeG-3 cells and Chinese hamster ovary cells stably transfected with human apoE cDNA constructs. These results indicate that the LDL effect operates at a post-transcriptional level. In pulse-chase experiments, the LDL effect on apoE accumulation in the media was observed when it was added only during the chase even in the presence of cycloheximide, indicating that LDL is functioning at a post-translational level. The use of brefeldin A (BFA), an agent that impedes protein transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus, suggests that the LDL effect occurs in a post-Golgi compartment. The addition of protease inhibitors could not duplicate the effects of LDL on the apoE accumulation in the medium. ApoA-I accumulation in the medium of HepG2 cells, but not albumin, was also significantly increased by 1.9-fold (n = 5, p < 0.001)."
https://openalex.org/W1540163919,"Dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH, EC 1.14.17.1) is present in both membrane-bound and soluble forms in neurosecretory vesicles. This study was designed to investigate the differences between membrane-bound and soluble DBH and how they may arise from translation of a single mRNA. Antisera to a peptide corresponding to the carboxyl terminus of rat DBH was found to specifically immunoprecipitate the 77- and 73-kDa subunits of newly synthesized DBH in rat brain. Thus, both soluble and membrane-bound forms contain the same carboxyl terminus. To investigate differences at the amino terminus, full-length rat DBH mRNA, translated in a cell-free system, produced a 66-kDa peptide. An additional higher molecular mass product was synthesized upon co-translational addition of microsomal membranes. This product was glycosylated since it bound to concanavalin A-Sepharose and reverted to the 66-kDa polypeptide after treatment with endoglycosidase H. This glycosylated product was resistant to protease digestion and fractionated with microsomal membranes on sucrose gradients, indicating that it is incorporated into the microsomal membranes. Amino-terminal sequencing of the glycosylated translation product indicated that the amino-terminal sequence was not cleaved. The results indicate that in the cell-free system newly synthesized DBH undergoes glycosylation and incorporation into microsomal membranes without cleavage of the NH2-terminal signal sequence."

From the amino acid sequence analyses of these peptides, we synthesized a DNA probe and utilized it for successful cloning of a gene encoding the alanine carrier protein (acp gene). The 5'-flanking region was determined by an inverse polymerase chain reaction, and an open reading frame consisting of 1,335 nucleotides was found. The amino acid sequence deduced from the open reading frame consists of 445 amino acids, and all the partial amino acid sequences determined are included in the sequence. Although the calculated M(r) of 47,803 is significantly larger than the apparent M(r) of 42,500 as reported previously (Hirata, H., Kambe, T., and Kagawa, Y. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 10653-10656), an in vitro translation experiment revealed that the product of the acp gene migrates at a position coinciding with that of the purified alanine carrier. Hydropathy analysis suggests that the protein contains at least 8 hydrophobic segments presumably spanning membrane. A homology search on a database reveals relatively high scores of homology with either the Escherichia coli melibiose carrier or the human Na+/glucose symporter, particularly in the region from Leu246 to Glu286. Furthermore, the region also reveals low but significant similarities to other Na(+)-coupled symporters."

With AEDANS-G-actin, the initial formation of a ternary G2S complex between two G-actin and one S1 molecules (Valentin-Ranc, C., Combeau, C., Carlier, M. F., and Pantaloni, D. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 17871-17879) has been confirmed. Data obtained with all probes are consistent with the subsequent rapid formation of G-actin-S1 oligomers in which the actin/S1 molar ratio is 2:1. Oligomers form above 0.6 microM G-actin with S1(A1) and above 3.5 microM G-actin with S1(A2), at 20 degrees C. Oligomerization is endothermic with a delta H of 14 kcal/mol. A tentative model is proposed to comprehensively account for the data and the structural features of the F-actin-S1 filament. Within this model, longitudinal actin-actin interactions take place in G2S, and lateral, hydrophobic actin-actin interactions appear upon formation of (G2S)n oligomers."
https://openalex.org/W1540512763,"Biologically active peptide hormones are synthesized from larger precursor proteins by a variety of post-translational processing reactions. To characterize these processing reactions further we have expressed preprogastrin in two endocrine cell lines and examined the molecular determinants involved in endoproteolysis at dibasic cleavage sites. The Gly93-Arg94-Arg95 carboxyl-terminal processing site of progastrin must be processed sequentially by an endoprotease, a carboxypeptidase, and an amidating enzyme to produce bioactive gastrin. For these studies the dibasic Arg94-Arg95 residues that serve as signals for the initiation of this processing cascade were mutated to Lys94-Arg95, Arg94-Lys95, and Lys94-Lys95. In the GH3 cells the Lys94-Arg95 mutation slightly diminished synthesis of carboxyl-terminally amidated gastrin, whereas in the MTC 6-23 cells this mutation had no effect on amidated gastrin synthesis. In contrast, both Arg94-Lys95 and Lys94-Lys95 mutations resulted in significantly diminished production of amidated gastrin in both cell lines. A specific hierarchy of preferred cleavage signals at this progastrin processing site was demonstrated in both cell lines, indicating that cellular dibasic endoproteases have stringent substrate specificities. Progastrins with the Lys94-Arg95 mutation in GH3 cells also demonstrated diminished processing at the Lys74-Lys75 dibasic site, thus single amino acid changes at one processing site may alter cleavage at distant sites. These studies provide insight into the post-translational processing and biological activation of not only gastrin but other peptide hormones as well."
https://openalex.org/W1481008741,"The protein statin is found in nuclei of nonproliferating cells. Here we report that statin is a phosphoprotein, phosphorylated at serine residues in cultured cells. During immunoprecipitation with anti-statin (S44) antibody, a 45-kDa protein co-precipitates with the 57-kDa statin. In vitro kinase assays demonstrate that the S44 immunoprecipitates can phosphorylate, besides statin, immunoglobulins, enolase, and casein, at either serine or serine/threonine residues. Kinase assays with immunoprecipitated proteins performed on casein- or enolase-impregnated gels show that these substrates are phosphorylated by the 45-kDa (p45) protein. When the S44 immunoprecipitates from human cultured fibroblasts with different in vitro life-spans were compared, the p45 kinase activity was present only in young nongrowing and senescent cells, but not in young growing ones. In other cell cultures, the kinase is detected only in protein complexes precipitated from quiescent 3T3 cells, but not from cycling 3T3 cells or from transformed human glioma (U251-4) cells. Cell fractionation studies, indicating that the phosphorylating activity of S44 immunoprecipitates correlates both qualitatively and quantitatively with the amount of statin present, provide strong evidence that in vivo statin is specifically associated with the p45 kinase. These results suggest that the nonproliferation-specific nature of statin is indeed related to the phosphorylated property of this protein and maybe contributed by the associated kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1488598014,"Using a Nicotiana tabacum leaf cDNA library in the expression vector lambda gt11, two cDNAs encoding the full-length precursor polypeptide (M(r) 20,696) of tobacco chloroplast ribosomal protein L24 were identified and sequenced. These cDNAs encode a mature protein of 146 amino acids (M(r) 16,418) with a transit peptide of 41 amino acids (M(r) 4,278). The mature tobacco L24 protein has 78, 65, 45, and 35% sequence identity with ribosomal proteins L24 of pea, spinach, Bacillus subtilis, and Escherichia coli, respectively. The transit peptide of tobacco L24 is 54 and 57% identical with that of L24 chloroplast ribosomal proteins of pea and spinach, respectively. An expressed beta-galactosidase:L24 fusion protein, bound to nitrocellulose filters, was used as affinity matrix to purify monospecific antibody to L24 protein. Using this monospecific antibody protein L24 was identified among high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-purified tobacco chloroplast ribosome 50 S subunit proteins. The predicted amino terminus of the mature L24 protein was confirmed by partial sequencing of the HPLC-purified L24 protein. Northern blot analysis revealed a single mRNA band (0.85-0.90 kilobase) corresponding in size to full-length L24 cDNA. The presence of multiple genes for L24 is suggested by Southern blot hybridization and characterization of two cDNAs for L24 which only differ in their 3'-noncoding sequences."
