It may well rank with epinephrine, norepinephrine, and histamine as one of the important regulatory amines of the body. Studies carried on in this laboratory on the biosynthesis of 5-hydroxytryptamine in animals indicate that tryptophan is the precursor, being converted by oxidation to 5-hydroxytryptophan, which then undergoes decarboxylation to yield 5hydroxytryptamine (7). The studies reported in this paper concern the enzyme, 5-hydroxytryptophan decarboxylase. Procedures for purification of the enzyme obtained from hog and guinea pig kidney homogenates and acetone-dried powders and some properties of these preparations are described."

DPNH can replace DPN and I-malate in the reduction of chloram- phenicol to the corresponding arylamine mediated by cell-free extracts of Escherichia coli. 2. When DPNH replaces DPN and I-malate, Aureomycin no longer is inhibitory and DPNH can reverse the inhibitory activity of Aureomycin in the present system. 3. Mn++ is necessary for the formation of both DPNH and arylamine and added Mntt- reverses the inhibition of arylamine formation from chlor- amphenicol. 4. The implications of these findings with respect to the antibiotic ac- tivity of Aureomycin are discussed. BIBLIOGRAPHY 1. Saz, A. K., and Marmur, J., Proc. Sot. Exp. Biol. and Med., 82,783 (1953). 2.

The reticulo-endothelial system is an important defence mechanism against malignant tumours in general2,3, and its stimulation therefore probably increases the general defence of the body against tumour growth."
