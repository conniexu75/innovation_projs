In contrast, SRK2E/OST1/SnRK2.6 encodes an Arabidopsis SnRK2 protein kinase and acts as a positive regulator in the ABA-induced stomatal closure. SRK2E/OST1 is activated by osmotic stress as well as by ABA, but the independence of the two activation processes has not yet been determined. Additionally, interaction between SRK2E/OST1 and PP2C-type phosphatases (ABI1 and ABI2) is not understood. In the present study, we demonstrated that the abi1-1 mutation, but not the abi2-1 mutation, strongly inhibited ABA-dependent SRK2E/OST1 activation. In contrast, osmotic stress activated SRK2E/OST1 even in abi1-1 and aba2-1 plants. The C-terminal regulatory domain of SRK2E/OST1 was required for its activation by both ABA and osmotic stress in Arabidopsis. The C-terminal domain was functionally divided into Domains I and II. Domain II was required only for the ABA-dependent activation of SRK2E/OST1, whereas Domain I was responsible for the ABA-independent activation. Full-length SRK2E/OST1 completely complemented the wilty phenotype of the srk2e mutant, but SRK2E/OST1 lacking Domain II did not. Domain II interacted with the ABI1 protein in a yeast two-hybrid assay. Our results suggested that the direct interaction between SRK2E/OST1 and ABI1 through Domain II plays a critical role in the control of stomatal closure.

Water is indispensable for plant activities such as photosynthesis, respiration, and growth. To overcome the serious problems caused by water-deficit conditions, plants have developed unique systems to prevent water loss from, and to retain water inside, their cells. Abscisic acid (ABA) 3The abbreviations used are: ABA, abscisic acid; ABI, ABA insensitive; OS, osmotic stress; SnRK2, Snf1-related protein kinase 2; GFP, green fluorescent protein. 3The abbreviations used are: ABA, abscisic acid; ABI, ABA insensitive; OS, osmotic stress; SnRK2, Snf1-related protein kinase 2; GFP, green fluorescent protein. is a stress-related plant hormone and plays a significant role in the adaptation to water stress (1Bray E.A.

Much is known concerning the function of ABA in the adaptive process, and many factors have been identified in ABA signaling. Protein phosphorylation is one of the best characterized events involved in ABA signaling. However, to understand the major process of ABA signaling, we need to characterize the detailed functions of each signaling molecule. Through a combination of biochemical and bioinformatics approaches, we found the ABA-specific protein kinase activities in Arabidopsis T87 cells and identified their genes as SnRK2 (SNF1-related protein kinase 2) (7Yoshida R. Hobo T. Ichimura K. Mizoguchi T. Takahashi F. Alonso J. Ecker J.R. Shinozaki K. Plant Cell Physiol. 2002; 43: 1473-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). SRK2E is one of the Arabidopsis SnRK2 specifically activated by ABA (7Yoshida R. Hobo T. Ichimura K. Mizoguchi T. Takahashi F. Alonso J. Ecker J.R. Shinozaki K. Plant Cell Physiol. 2002; 43: 1473-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Loss of SRK2E function causes an ABA-insensitive phenotype in stomatal closure (7Yoshida R. Hobo T. Ichimura K. Mizoguchi T. Takahashi F. Alonso J. Ecker J.R. Shinozaki K. Plant Cell Physiol. 2002; 43: 1473-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). This srk2e mutant cannot cope with a rapid humidity decrease and results in a wilty phenotype. On the other hand, a drought-sensitive mutant, open stomata 1 (ost1), was identified by a unique system using infrared thermography, and the OST1 gene was found to be identical to SRK2E (At4g33950) (8Mustilli A.C. Merlot S. Vavasseur A. Fenzi F. Giraudat J. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 3089-3099Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). Reactive oxygen species have been proposed to function as second messengers for ABA signaling in stomata cells and to activate Ca2+ channels (9Pei Z.M. Murata Y. Benning G. Thomine S. Klusener B. Allen G.J. Grill E. Schloeder J.I. Nature. 2000; 406: 731-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (1595) Google Scholar). SRK2E/OST1 may act upstream of reactive oxygen species production (8Mustilli A.C. Merlot S. Vavasseur A. Fenzi F. Giraudat J. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 3089-3099Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). Thus, SRK2E/OST1/SnRK2.6 is now regarded as a major, positive regulator of ABA signaling in Arabidopsis. The importance of SnRK2 in water stress signaling has been extensively studied in many species. The genes that have been described are wheat ABA-induced protein kinase 1 PKABA1 (10Anderberg R.J. Walker-Simmons M.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10183-10187Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), fava bean ABA-activated serine-threonine protein kinase AAPK (11Li J. Wang X.Q.

Chem. 2004; 279: 41758-41766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). The SnRK2 gene family is unique to plants and consists of 10 genes in Arabidopsis (17Hrabak E.M. Chan C.W.M. Gribskov M. Harper J.F. Choi J.H. Halford N. Kudia J. Luan S. Nimmo H.G. Sussman M.R. Thomas M. Walker-Simmons K. Zhu J.K. Harmon A.C. Plant Physiol. 2003; 132: 666-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). Recently, we demonstrated that SRK2C/OSKL4/SnRK2.8 was activated by osmotic stress and significantly increased the drought tolerance of Arabidopsis plants through activating stress-responsive gene expression in transgenic overexpressors (18Umezawa T. Yoshida R. Maruyama K. Yamaguchi-Shinozaki K. Shinozaki K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17306-17311Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The manner in which stomata cells sense humidity changes to activate stomatal closure remains unknown. There are apparently at least two pathways in drought stress signaling that target stomatal closure (19Luan S. Plant Cell Environ. 2002; 25: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). One is ABA dependent; the other is ABA independent, namely, an osmosensing pathway. Osmoregulation of inward K+ channels has been found to function in stomata cells, which provoked the presence of the osmosensing pathway in plant cells (20Liu K. Luan S. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1957-1970Crossref PubMed Scopus (2306) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the nature of the ABA-independent osmosensing pathway in stomatal closure. In the present study, we examined whether ABA-dependent or ABA-independent pathways, or both, function in the activation of SRK2E/OST1 to close stomata cells under low humidity stress. Using Arabidopsis T87 cultured cells we demonstrated that not only ABA, but also osmotic stress (OS), activates SRK2E/OST1 in vivo (7Yoshida R. Hobo T. Ichimura K. Mizoguchi T. Takahashi F. Alonso J. Ecker J.R. Shinozaki K. Plant Cell Physiol. 2002; 43: 1473-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). An experiment using ABA-insensitive or ABA-deficient mutants revealed that the OS-dependent activation of SRK2E/OST1 was not mediated by ABA, implying that two independent pathways exist and function in SRK2E/OST1 signaling. Domain analysis of the SRK2E/OST1 protein indicated that its C-terminal region plays an important role in controlling both ABA- and OS-dependent activation of SRK2E/OST1. A yeast two-hybrid analysis showed direct physical binding between SRK2E/OST1 and ABI1. Interestingly, the binding site was located to the C terminus of SRK2E/OST1 that was needed for ABA response. The possible mechanisms involved in the activation of SRK2E/OST1 in the response to ABA and OS were discussed in relation to stomata closure. Plant Growth Conditions—The Columbia and Landsberg erecta (Ler) ecotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana were used. The seeds of wild-type (Columbia, Ler), srk2e, and transgenic plants were sterilized with 70% ethanol and 1% antiformin and sown on Gamborg’s B5 medium agar plates (21Valvekens D. Van Montagu M. Van Lijsebettens M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5536-5540Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar) containing 1% sucrose. They were grown under 16 h of light/8 h dark conditions at 22 °C for 3 weeks. Generation of Transgenic Cells and Plants—The transgenic plants and cells were generated by fusing each construct in-frame to green fluorescent protein (GFP) driven by the CaMV 35S promotor in pBE2113 (22Mitsuhara I. Ugaki M. Hirochika H. Ohshina M. Murakami T. Gotoh Y. Katayose Y. Nakamura S. Honkura R. Nishimiya S. Ueno K. Mochizuki A. Tanimoto H. Tsugawa H. Otsuki Y. Ohashi Y. Plant Cell Physiol. 1996; 37: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar) or pBiG2113 (23Taji T. Ohsumi C. Iuchi S. Seki M. Kasuga M. Kobayashi M. Yamaguchi-Shinozaki K. Shinozaki K. Plant J. 2002; 29: 417-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). The transformation vector was introduced into Agrobacterium to transform wild-type (Col) and srk2e plants and T87 cells. Generation of 35S::2E-GFP abi1-1, 35S::2E-GFP abi2-1, and 35S::2E-GFP aba2-1—35S::2E-GFP abi1-1 was generated by crossing abi1-1 with 35S::SRK2E-GFP, 35S::2E-GFP abi2-1 was generated by crossing abi2-1 with 35S::SRK2E-GFP, and 35S::2E-GFP aba2-1 was generated by crossing aba2-1 with 35S::SRK2E-GFP. In each case, the F1 was allowed to self fertilize, and candidate F2 plants were genotyped by a combination of phenotypic examinations. To generate 35S::2E-GFP abi1-1 and 35S::2E-GFP abi2-1, phenotypes showing tolerance to both ABA (3 μm) and kanamycin (50 μm) were screened from the F2 population. To generate 35S::2E-GFP aba2-1, phenotypes showing tolerance to both glucose (7%) and kanamycin (50 μm) were screened from the F2 population. Low Humidity Treatment and Water Loss Measurement—Low humidity treatment and water loss measurement were performed as described previously (7Yoshida R. Hobo T. Ichimura K. Mizoguchi T. Takahashi F. Alonso J. Ecker J.R. Shinozaki K. Plant Cell Physiol. 2002; 43: 1473-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). ABA, OS, and Cold Treatment in Arabidopsis T87 Cells and Plants—ABA treatment in T87 cells was performed as described previously (7Yoshida R. Hobo T. Ichimura K. Mizoguchi T. Takahashi F. Alonso J. Ecker J.R. Shinozaki K. Plant Cell Physiol. 2002; 43: 1473-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). For the OS treatment in T87 cells, 1 m NaCl and 1.6 m of sorbitol solution were applied to the suspension cells in a 1:1 ratio resulting in final concentrations of 0.5 m NaCl and 0.8 m sorbitol. For the cold treatment of the T87 cells, 1.5-ml tubes of suspension were put on ice. The ABA and OS treatments of Arabidopsis plants were carried out by placing the plant roots in various concentrations of ABA and 0.5 m NaCl or 0.8 m sorbitol solution. Protein Extraction and In-gel Kinase Assay—Protein extraction and in-gel kinase assay were performed as previously described (7Yoshida R. Hobo T. Ichimura K. Mizoguchi T. Takahashi F. Alonso J. Ecker J.R. Shinozaki K. Plant Cell Physiol. 2002; 43: 1473-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). RNA Extraction and RT-PCR Analysis—RNA extraction and RT-PCR analysis were performed as previously described (7Yoshida R. Hobo T. Ichimura K. Mizoguchi T. Takahashi F. Alonso J. Ecker J.R. Shinozaki K. Plant Cell Physiol. 2002; 43: 1473-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar) except that the following primers were used in rab18 expression: 5′-CGATCCAGCAGCAGTATGAC-3′ for forward and 5′-TTCGAAGCTTAACGGCCACC-3′ for reverse. Two-hybrid Interaction Assays—For the two-hybrid assays, each construct shown in Fig. 6 was amplified by PCR and cloned into the pGBKT7 or pGADT7 vectors (Clontech). For interaction studies, plasmids containing fusion proteins were co-introduced into Saccharomyces cerevisiae AH109 and grown on medium lacking Leu, Trp, and His in the presence of 20 mm 3-AT. The α-galactosidase activity assay was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Clontech). Low Humidity Stress Activated SRK2E/OST1—ABA activated GFP-fused SRK2E (simply designated as 2E-GFP) in Arabidopsis root tissues in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A) as previously reported (8Mustilli A.C. Merlot S. Vavasseur A. Fenzi F. Giraudat J. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 3089-3099Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). A low concentration of ABA (0.5 μm) was sufficient to activate 2E-GFP in our case. ABA activated two protein kinases, p44 and p42, in wild-type roots, and p44 was not detected in srk2e, indicating that p44 corresponds to SRK2E (Fig. 1B). The kinase activities were not detected in leaf tissues treated with ABA even though ABA-inducible genes were clearly expressed in the same tissues under the same conditions (Fig. 1, C and D). These results suggested that the activation of the kinases was root specific. Using the transgenic plants, we next examined whether low humidity directly activated SRK2E/OST1. 2E-GFP was clearly activated by low humidity in leaf tissues (Fig. 1E). The p44 kinase was also activated by low humidity in wild-type leaves, but not in the srk2e leaves (Fig. 1F). To confirm whether OS activated SRK2E/OST1 in Arabidopsis, we transformed Arabidopsis T87 cells with 35S::SRK2E-GFP. Not only ABA, but also OS, such as sorbitol and NaCl, activated the 2E-GFP in Arabidopsis cells (Fig. 1G). Cold stress, however, did not activate 2E-GFP (Fig. 1G). The ABA-dependent Activation of SRK2E/OST1 Suppressed by abi1-1 but Not by abi2-1—To investigate the roles of ABI1 and ABI2 in the activation of SRK2E/OST1 by ABA, we tested the 2E-GFP activity in root tissues of abi1-1 and abi2-1 plants, and aba2-1 was used as a control. ABA activated the 2E-GFP in wild-type plants, but not in abi1-1 plants (Fig. 2A). In contrast, abi2-1 and aba2-1 did not affect the activation of the 2E-GFP by ABA (Fig. 2A). These results indicated that two similar PP2C, ABI1 and ABI2, have distinct roles in ABA signaling in terms of regulation of SRK2E/OST1. The abi and aba Mutations Did Not Affect the OS-dependent Activation of SRK2E/OST1—To investigate the role of ABA signaling in the OS-dependent activation of SRK2E/OST1, we tested the 2E-GFP activity in root and leaf tissues treated with low humidity and sorbitol, respectively. None of the abi1-1, abi2-1, and aba2-1 mutations significantly affected the OS-dependent activation of 2E-GFP. These results indicated that ABA signaling is not required for the OS-dependent activation of SRK2E/OST1 and that ABA and OS may independently activate kinase in Arabidopsis plants. We observed severe water loss in both abi1-1 and aba2-1 mutants (Fig. 2C), but the OS-dependent 2E-GFP activation was normal in these mutants (Fig. 2A). These results supported the central role of the ABA-dependent pathway in SRK2E/OST1 activation in stomatal closure (7Yoshida R. Hobo T. Ichimura K. Mizoguchi T. Takahashi F. Alonso J. Ecker J.R. Shinozaki K. Plant Cell Physiol. 2002; 43: 1473-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 8Mustilli A.C. Merlot S. Vavasseur A. Fenzi F. Giraudat J. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 3089-3099Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). Domain Analysis of the SRK2E/OST1 Protein—The Arabidopsis SnRK2 gene has a kinase domain that is similar to the yeast SNF1 protein kinase (24Halford N.G. Bouly J.P. Thomas M. Kreis M. Walker J.C. Plant Protein Kinases, Advances in Plant Pathology. Academic Press, London2000: 405-428Google Scholar). Unlike SnRK1 and SnRK3 proteins, SnRK2 proteins do not have common regulatory motifs but seem to have an important domain(s) in their N- or C-terminal regions. We first compared the C-terminal regions of 10 Arabidopsis SnRK2 proteins and found two conserved domains; one is ∼30 amino acids starting from the end of the kinase domain (Domain I), and the other is ∼40 amino acids starting from the end of Domain I (Domain II) (Fig. 3A). Domain I is highly conserved in all 10 SnRK2 proteins. Domain II can be classified into two types in Arabidopsis SnRK2 proteins, as previously pointed out (24Halford N.G. Bouly J.P. Thomas M. Kreis M. Walker J.C. Plant Protein Kinases, Advances in Plant Pathology. Academic Press, London2000: 405-428Google Scholar). One group has an Asp-rich region defined as SnRK2a, and the other has a Glu-rich region defined as SnRK2b. SRK2E/OST1 belongs to the SnRK2a group together with four other SnRK2 proteins (SRK2C/OSKL4, SRK2D/OSKL3, SRK2F/OSKL5, and SRK2I/OSKL2). We therefore overexpressed SRK2D, SRK2F, and SRK2I in T87 cells as a GFP fusion protein and examined their responses to ABA and OS. Fused to GFP, these kinases were activated by both ABA and OS in a manner similar to 2E-GFP (Fig. 3B). We also tested the response to ABA and OS in SRK2G/OSKL8, which belongs to the SnRK2b group, by using 35S::SRK2G-GFP transgenic cells. The 2G-GFP was strongly activated by OS, but not by ABA (Fig. 3B), as previously reported (16Boudsocq M. Barbier-Brygoo H. Lauriere C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41758-41766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Domain II was well conserved among three SnRK2s from different plant species, i.e. Arabidopsis SRK2E/OST1, fava bean AAPK (11Li J. Wang X.Q. Watson M.B. Assmann S.M. Science. 2000; 287: 300-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar), and rice SAPK8 (Fig. 3C) (15Kobayashi Y. Yamamoto S. Minami H. Kagaya Y. Hottori T. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 1163-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). AAPK and SAPK8 have been shown to be activated by ABA (11Li J. Wang X.Q. Watson M.B. Assmann S.M. Science. 2000; 287: 300-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 15Kobayashi Y. Yamamoto S. Minami H. Kagaya Y. Hottori T. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 1163-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). These results suggested that Domain II is critical for ABA-induced activation of SRK2E/OST1 and that other SnRK2s belong to the SnRK2a group. Thus, we made two types of C-terminal-deleted constructs of SRK2E/OST1 and overexpressed them as GFP fusion proteins in T87 cells to determine the role of Domain II in the activation (Fig. 4A). We also overexpressed the N terminus-deleted SRK2E/OST1 in T87 cells. Effects of these deletions on SRK2E/OST1 activities were analyzed by in-gel kinase assay (Fig. 4B). Both ABA- and OS-dependent activities decreased but were not completely lost in N-terminal-truncated SRK2E/OST1 (2EΔN). When a C-terminal region of 319-357 amino acids (Domain II) was deleted (represented by 2EΔC1), the ABA-dependent activation was specifically inhibited, whereas the OS-dependent activation was either normal or increased. The SRK2E/OST1 kinase lacking both Domains I and II (2EΔC2) completely lost responsiveness to ABA and OS. These deletion analyses supported our idea that SRK2E/OST1 may be activated by two independent pathways, namely ABA- and OS-dependent pathways. Essential Roles of the C-terminal Domain in the Physiological Function of SRK2E/OST1—Because the C-terminal region is indispensable for both ABA- and OS-dependent activation of SRK2E/OST1, we examined the effects of C terminus deletion on the functional complementation of the wilty phenotype in srk2e. As shown in Fig. 5A, 35S::2EΔC1-GFP srk2e plants had a wilty phenotype in comparison to 35S::2EWT-GFP srk2e plants. We measured the water loss in these plants. 2EWT-GFP fully complemented the wilty phenotype of srk2e, but 2EΔC1-GFP did not completely rescue the wilty phenotype (Fig. 5B). This truncated SRK2E/OST1 appeared to retain partial function of SRK2E/OST1, as the level of water loss was intermediate between that of srk2e plants and the transgenic srk2e plants complemented with full-length SRK2E/OST1. However, the level of water loss in 35S::2EΔC1-GFP srk2e plants reached the same level as that in srk2e plants 60 min after the start of water depletion. To elucidate the effect of ABA on the C terminus deletion, we treated the transgenic plants with ABA prior to the water depletion experiment. A high level of water loss was still observed in the ABA-treated 35S::2EΔC1-GFP srk2e plants as compared with the ABA-treated 35S::2EWT-GFP srk2e plants (Fig. 5C). The effect of low humidity on the activation of the truncated SRK2E/OST1 was examined in the transgenic plants. The in-gel kinase assay clearly demonstrated that 2EΔC1 was still able to respond to the OS signal (Fig. 5D). These results suggested that low humidity or OS-activated SRK2E/OST1 can transduce the stress signal to induce stomata closure and that the C-terminal Domain II region may be responsible for both ABA-dependent activation of SRK2E/OST1 and complete stomatal closure. Physical Interaction between the C-Terminal Regions of SRK2E/OST1 and ABI1—The yeast two-hybrid assay was conducted to examine the interactions between SRK2E/OST1 and well known factors identified in ABA signaling, i.e. ABI1 (25Leung J. Bouvier-Durand M. Morris P.C. Guerrier D. Chefdor F. Giraudat J. Science. 1994; 264: 1448-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar), ABI2 (26Leung J. Merlot S. Giraudat J. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 759-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar), AtRac1 (27Lemichez E. Wu Y. Sanchez J.P. Mettouchi A. Mathur J. Chua N.H. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1808-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), and GPA1 (28Wang X.Q. Ullah H. Jones A.M. Assman S.M. Science. 2001; 292: 2070-2072Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Strong binding activity was observed between SRK2E/OST1 and ABI1 (Fig. 6A). The abi1-1 mutation weakened the binding to SRK2E/OST1 relative to the wild-type ABI1 (Fig. 6B). Domain analysis indicated that the C-terminal Domain II involved in the ABA-dependent response was required and sufficient for the interaction with ABI1 (Fig. 7, A and B). ABI1 did not bind to the C-terminal corresponding region of SRK2G/OSKL8 (311-353 amino acids) that does not respond to ABA (16Boudsocq M. Barbier-Brygoo H. Lauriere C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41758-41766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). SRK2E/OST1/SnRK2.6 plays key roles in the responses to OS and ABA in stomatal closure. SRK2E/OST1/SnRK2.6 with deletions of the C-terminal regulatory domains were used to study the roles of this kinase in the stomatal closure triggered by low humidity in Arabidopsis. Biochemical analysis of the GFP fusion of the kinases with the abi (aba-insensitive) and aba (aba-deficient) mutations and the yeast two-hybrid analysis enabled us to demonstrate that the ABA-dependent and -independent pathways mediate between low humidity and stomatal closure in Arabidopsis. We also pointed out critical roles of Domain II in the C-terminal regulatory region of SRK2E/OST1 in the interaction with ABI1 and activation by ABA in stomata closure. ABA-dependent and -independent Pathways Mediate between Low Humidity and Stomatal Closure in Arabidopsis—In Arabidopsis T87 culture cells, OS, such as sorbitol and NaCl, activated SRK2E/OST1 very rapidly, i.e. in 5 min, as quickly as ABA did (Fig. 1G). Because OS itself promotes ABA synthesis through 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase or Arabidopsis aldehyde oxidase gene expression (29Iuchi S. Kobayashi M. Taji T. Naramoto M. Seki M. Kato T. Tabata S. Kakubari Y. Yamaguchi-Shinozaki K. Shinozaki K. Plant J. 2001; 27: 325-333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Seo M. Koshiba T. Trends Plant Sci. 2002; 7: 41-48Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar), in the present study the ABA dependence of OS-activated SRK2E/OST1 was examined using Arabidopsis abi and aba mutants. In the abi1-1 mutant, OS activated SRK2E/OST1, but ABA did not (Fig. 2A). In aba2-1 and abi2-1, however, both ABA and OS activated SRK2E/OST1. These results clearly showed that OS directly activates SRK2E/OST1 in Arabidopsis and that there are at least two independent pathways to activate SRK2E/OST1, the ABA-dependent and -independent pathways. Not only ABA and OS, but also low humidity, activate SRK2E/OST1 and prevent rapid water loss in Arabidopsis. Low humidity resulted in more water loss in abi1-1 and aba2-1 than in wild-type plants (Fig. 2C). Although abi1-1 blocked the ABA-dependent activation of SRK2E/OST1, kinase activation was detected even in abi1-1 and aba2-1 plants with the severe wilty phenotype (Fig. 2). The loss-of-function srk2e had a wilty phenotype when exposed to low humidity stress (7Yoshida R. Hobo T. Ichimura K. Mizoguchi T. Takahashi F. Alonso J. Ecker J.R. Shinozaki K. Plant Cell Physiol. 2002; 43: 1473-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). These results suggested that the ABA-dependent and -independent pathways mediate cellular signals between low humidity and stomatal closure as described in Fig. 8 and discussed below. Distinct Roles of Domains I and II in the Activation of SRK2E/OST1—We proposed that SRK2E/OST1 may play a critical role in ABA-dependent stomatal closure (7Yoshida R. Hobo T. Ichimura K. Mizoguchi T. Takahashi F. Alonso J. Ecker J.R. Shinozaki K. Plant Cell Physiol. 2002; 43: 1473-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Characterization of SRK2E/OST1 is important to understanding the molecular bases of this signaling and will help in identifying novel upstream factors, including specific receptor(s) of ABA. There are no conserved regulatory domains in SnRK2 genes, except for the short acidic patches in their C-terminal regions (24Halford N.G. Bouly J.P. Thomas M. Kreis M. Walker J.C. Plant Protein Kinases, Advances in Plant Pathology. Academic Press, London2000: 405-428Google Scholar). Using T87 cells, we found two distinct domains required for the activation of SRK2E/OST1 (Figs. 3 and 4); one is the Domain II (319-357 amino acids) region involved in ABA-dependent activation (Fig. 8, Pathway I), and the other is the Domain I (283-318 amino acids) region that functions in the ABA-independent pathway (Pathway III). The Domain I region contains a sequence conserved among all the reported SnRK2 proteins (Fig. 3A). This region may be important for the OS-dependent and ABA-independent activation of all the SnRK2 proteins. Deletion of Domain II specifically blocked the ABA-dependent activation of SRK2E in Arabidopsis (Fig. 3). The importance of the C terminus was also demonstrated in rice SnRK2 (15Kobayashi Y. Yamamoto S. Minami H. Kagaya Y. Hottori T. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 1163-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). ABA activates SAPK8, but not SAPK2, in rice. A chimeric kinase made by substitution of the C terminus of SAPK8 (including both Domains I and II) for the same region of SAPK2 was activated by ABA (15Kobayashi Y. Yamamoto S. Minami H. Kagaya Y. Hottori T. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 1163-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). In our study we further isolated the ABA-responsive region to Domain II. Domain II is highly conserved in the ABA-activated SnRK2s in different plant species and may commonly function as an ABA-responsive domain. We also confirmed that the deletion of Domain II significantly increased the OS-dependent activation of SRK2E. This suggested that Domain II may affect Domain I and repress the OS-dependent kinase activity. SRK2E/OST1 without Domain II only partially complemented the wilty phenotype of srk2e (Fig. 5), but the truncated form of SRK2E was activated by low humidity in a gel kinase assay. These results also supported our idea that the ABA-dependent and -independent pathways shown in Fig. 8 mediate between low humidity and stomatal closure. Both signaling pathways may be required for complete stomatal closure in response to sudden water stress. Roles of the Physical Interaction between SRK2E and ABI1 in the Stomatal Closure Triggered by Low Humidity in Arabidopsis—We found that SRK2E/OST1 interacted with ABI1, but not with other factors involved in ABA signaling, including a homologous PP2C ABI2 (Fig. 6). The abi1-1 mutation, but not the abi2-1 mutation, inhibited the ABA-dependent activation of SRK2E/OST1 (Fig. 2). These results indicated that ABI1 and ABI2 have distinct roles in the signaling in terms of the control of SRK2E in Arabidopsis as shown in Fig. 8. AB11 did not bind to the C terminus of SRK2G/OSKL8 that lacked the conserved sequence in Domain II of the ABA-responsive SnRK2s, such as SRK2E/OST1, AAPK, and SAPK8 (Fig. 3A, C). ABI1 interacted with a HD-Zip transcriptional regulator, ATHB6 (31Himmelbach A. Hoffmann T. Leube M. Hohener B. Grill E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3029-3038Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), and a SOS2-like protein kinase of PSK18 (32Zhang W. Qin C. Zhao J. Wang X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9508-9513Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Phospholipase D-derived phosphatidic acid has been shown to interact with ABI1 and inhibit its PP2C activity (33Ohta M. Guo Y. Halfter U. Zhu J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 11771-11776Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The abi1-1 mutation weakened the binding to SRK2E/OST1, as found in the interactions between ATHB6 and ABI1 (31Himmelbach A. Hoffmann T. Leube M. Hohener B. Grill E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3029-3038Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) or SOS2 and ABI2 (34Guo Y. Xiong L. Song C.P. Gong D. Halfer U. Zhu J.K. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 233-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Members of the SnRK2 family may activate and be activated by different downstream and upstream factors, respectively, using their distinct C-terminal regions, especially Domain II. Based on the present results, we propose that ABI1 may have two roles in the ABA-dependent pathway to control stomatal closure, as shown in Fig. 8. ABI1 and ABI2 may function as negative regulators of ABA signaling in step 5 of Pathway II. ABI1 may have a role in Pathway I of the ABA-dependent pathway as well. In this pathway, ABI1 interacts with Domain II of SRK2E/OST1. Considering the similar wilty phenotypes of srk2e and abi1-1 and the weakened binding activity of the abi1-1 protein to SRK2E, we prefer a model in which ABI1 functions as a positive regulator in the activation of SRK2E by low humidity (Fig. 8, Pathway I, step 3). If ABI1 functions as a negative regulator for SRK2E, the weaker interaction between the abi1-1 protein and SRK2E should result in higher SRK2E activity. Domain II is required for interaction with ABI1 and activation by ABA (Pathway I, step 4). SRK2E without Domain II was activated by low humidity but only partially complemented the wilty phenotype of srk2e (Fig. 5). Both steps 5 and 9 in the ABA-dependent and -independent pathways may be required for the full complementation of the wilty phenotype of srk2e, as described earlier. An alternative explanation is that Domain II may be required for an interaction with a downstream factor in stomatal closure triggered by low humidity (Fig. 8, step 9). We obtained a loss-of-function mutant of abi1 with a T-DNA insertion and found that the ABA-dependent activation of SRK2E was not affected by the abi1 null mutation (data not shown). The abi1-1 mutation behaved as a dominant negative mutation in the ABA signaling (35Gosti F. Beaudoin N. Serizet C. Webb A.A.R. Vartanian N. Giraudat J. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 1897-1909Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar) (Pathway II, step 5). The abi1-1 protein may trap a regulator protein or a downstream factor of SRK2E and function as a dominant negative inhibitor by blocking interaction of the proteins with Domain II of SRK2E. The OS-induced activation of rice, SAPK1, and SAPK2 appeared to be regulated by protein phosphorylation (15Kobayashi Y. Yamamoto S. Minami H. Kagaya Y. Hottori T. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 1163-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Therefore, protein phosphorylation may participate in the activation of SRK2E/OST1. ABI1 encodes a PP2C-type protein phosphatase (25Leung J. Bouvier-Durand M. Morris P.C. Guerrier D. Chefdor F. Giraudat J. Science. 1994; 264: 1448-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). One possible explanation for the functional interaction between SRK2E and ABI1 is that the latter may regulate the former by de-phosphorylation. This is not likely, however, because the abi1-1 protein has a much weaker binding activity to Domain II (Fig. 6) and less phosphatase activity (35Gosti F. Beaudoin N. Serizet C. Webb A.A.R. Vartanian N. Giraudat J. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 1897-1909Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar) than wild-type ABI1. The ABA-dependent activation of SRK2E was inhibited by abi1-1 (Fig. 2), supporting the idea that ABI1 may not be involved in the dephosphorylation of SRK2E. The upstream kinases that directly activate yeast SNF1 or animal AMPK, similar to the SnRK2 family members, were recently identified and characterized (36Nath N. McCartney R.R. Schmidt M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3909-3917Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 37Woods A. Johnstone S.R. Dickerson K. Leiper F.C. Fryer L.G. Neumann D. Schlattner U. Wallimann T. Carlson M. Carling D.

A. 2003; 100: 8839-8843Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Thus, to understand the molecular bases of ABA or OS signaling, it is necessary to identify the upstream factor(s) that directly activate SRK2E/OST1. We are currently trying to find the candidate genes that would bind to the SRK2E/OST1 C terminus and regulate its ABA-specific response. We thank Hiroko Kobayashi for technical assistance."

One example is DYT1 dystonia, a neurodevelopmental disease caused by an in-frame deletion (Δgag) in the gene encoding torsinA. Here we show that neurons from both torsinA null (Tor1a−/−) and homozygous disease mutant “knockin” mice (Tor1aΔgag/Δgag) contain severely abnormal nuclear membranes, although non-neuronal cell types appear normal. These membrane abnormalities develop in postmigratory embryonic neurons and subsequently worsen with further neuronal maturation, a finding evocative of the developmental dependence of DYT1 dystonia. These observations demonstrate that neurons have a unique requirement for nuclear envelope localized torsinA function and suggest that loss of this activity is a key molecular event in the pathogenesis of DYT1 dystonia.

These observations demonstrate that neurons have a unique requirement for nuclear envelope localized torsinA function and suggest that loss of this activity is a key molecular event in the pathogenesis of DYT1 dystonia. DYT1 dystonia is an autosomal-dominant disease invariably caused by a three base pair deletion in the TOR1A gene. This mutation removes a codon (Δgag; ΔE) that normally encodes a glutamic acid residue in the C terminus of torsinA (Ozelius et al., 1997Ozelius L.J. Hewett J.W. Page C.E. Bressman S.B. Kramer P.L.

Genet. 1997; 17: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). Although torsinA is broadly expressed (Ozelius et al., 1997Ozelius L.J. Hewett J.W. Page C.E. Bressman S.B. Kramer P.L. Shalish C. de Leon D. Brin M.F. Raymond D. Corey D.P. et al.The early-onset torsion dystonia gene (DYT1) encodes an ATP-binding protein.Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar), DYT1 dystonia manifests as abnormal, involuntary twisting movements reflecting selective dysfunction of CNS motor circuits. In addition, the disease typically begins during a discrete period of early childhood (Berardelli et al., 1998Berardelli A. Rothwell J.C. Hallett M. Thompson P.D. Manfredi M. Marsden C.D.

These characteristics suggest that understanding the pathogenesis of DYT1 dystonia may provide unique insight into processes involved in neuronal development and function. TorsinA is a peripheral membrane protein that resides in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (Kustedjo et al., 2000Kustedjo K. Bracey M.H. Cravatt B.F.

TorsinA is a member of the AAA+ (ATPase associated with different cellular activities) protein family; these proteins typically function as oligomers and use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to disassemble protein complexes. AAA+ proteins participate in a diverse range of biological functions, including membrane trafficking, powering cellular motors, and protein chaperone activities (Neuwald et al., 1999Neuwald A.F.

Although inclusion in the AAA+ protein family provides little insight into the cellular role of torsinA, several observations indicate that the nuclear envelope lumen is a site of torsinA activity (Gerace, 2004Gerace L.

USA. 2004; 101: 7612-7617Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Consistent with this notion, torsinA interacts with the luminal domain of the inner nuclear membrane protein lamina-associated polypeptide 1 (LAP1) (Goodchild and Dauer, 2005Goodchild R.E. Dauer W.T. The AAA+ protein torsinA interacts with a conserved domain present in LAP1 and a novel ER protein.J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In addition, disease-associated ΔE-torsinA accumulates abnormally in the nuclear envelope (Gonzalez-Alegre and Paulson, 2004Gonzalez-Alegre P. Paulson H.L. Aberrant cellular behavior of mutant torsinA implicates nuclear envelope dysfunction in DYT1 dystonia.J.

Despite this progress in understanding the biology of torsinA, there are no experiments demonstrating an effect of wild-type or ΔE-torsinA on nuclear envelope function, and existing animal models have provided conflicting information as to whether ΔE-torsinA is associated with the nuclear envelope in vivo (Cao et al., 2005Cao S. Gelwix C.C. Caldwell K.A. Caldwell G.A. Torsin-mediated protection from cellular stress in the dopaminergic neurons of Caenorhabditis elegans.J.

In addition, ΔE-torsinA abnormally accumulates in the nuclear envelope of both neuronal and nonneuronal cells, calling into question the relationship between nuclear envelope function and disease pathogenesis. Furthermore, although models of disease pathogenesis depend critically on understanding whether a pathogenic mutation confers a gain or loss of function to the disease protein, the effect of the Δgag mutation on torsinA function is unclear. To address these limitations, we generated torsinA null and Δgag knockin mice and have used these animals to explore the normal cellular role of torsinA and the effect of the DYT1 mutation on torsinA function. We used gene targeting to generate torsinA null (Tor1a−/−) (Figure 1B) and Δgag knockin (Tor1aΔgag/Δgag) mice (Figure 1C). The DYT1 knockin mice contain the Δgag mutation in the endogenous mouse Tor1a gene (Figures 1C and 1D). To prevent nonspecific effects from the PGK-neomycin resistance selection cassette, both lines of mice were crossed with transgenic Cre recombinase mice that excise the cassette from the germ line (see the Supplemental Data available with this article online). Tor1a+/− and Tor1a+/Δgag heterozygous intercrosses generated all expected genotypes with normal Mendelian frequency. However, while Tor1a+/− and Tor1a+/Δgag heterozygotes were indistinguishable from their littermate controls, Tor1a−/− and Tor1aΔgag/Δgag animals typically died within 48 hr of birth. Tor1a−/− and Tor1aΔgag/Δgag animals move, breath, and respond to stimuli, but they typically fail to feed or vocalize. Although torsinA is ubiquitously expressed at birth (Figure 1F), Tor1a−/− and Tor1aΔgag/Δgag pups display no obvious developmental abnormalities (Figure 1G). The striking similarity between the Tor1a−/− and Tor1aΔgag/Δgag animals suggested that Tor1aΔgag may be a loss-of-function allele. However, it remained possible that this comparison was confounded by genetic background or that the Tor1aΔgag allele might produce more mechanistically complex effects than a simple loss of function. Thus, we formally tested whether Tor1aΔgag was a loss-of-function allele by crossing it onto the null background, generating Tor1aΔgag/− animals. Similar to Tor1a−/− and Tor1aΔgag/Δgag animals, Tor1aΔgag/− mice appeared normally developed, but failed to survive past 48 hr. Thus, our genetic analysis suggests strongly that Tor1aΔgag is a loss-of-function allele. To test whether the Δgag mutation might cause this loss of function by altering the stability of torsinA protein, we next measured torsinA protein levels in the Tor1a mutant mice. We found that steady-state levels of torsinA decrease with Tor1aΔgag gene dosage in all tissues examined (Figure 2A), even though homozygous Tor1aΔgag/Δgag knockin mice have normal levels of torsinA mRNA (Figure 2C). We subsequently assessed whether torsinA protein levels are also reduced by the Δgag mutation in the human disease. Similar to our results in mice, there is less torsinA in skin fibroblasts derived from DYT1 patients (heterozygous for Δgag) compared with controls (Figure 2D). These observations indicate that Tor1aΔgag animals accurately model some of the molecular features of DYT1 dystonia and suggest that loss of torsinA activity may contribute to the neurological symptoms of the disease. We next explored the effects of torsinA deficiency on the developing CNS of Tor1a−/− and Tor1aΔgag/Δgag mice at embryonic day 18 (E18), typically the final day of mouse gestation. The brains of homozygous mutant animals appear grossly normal (Figure 3A), exhibiting normal neocortical layering (Figure 3B) and spinal cord development (Figure 3C). In addition, normal levels of synapsin indicate that gross synaptic development in the spinal cord, the most mature area of the CNS, is comparable between Tor1a−/− and Tor1aΔgag/Δgag mice and their wild-type littermates (Figure 3D). Because dopaminergic dysfunction is implicated in other forms of dystonia (Bandmann and Wood, 2002Bandmann O. Wood N.W. Dopa-responsive dystonia—the story so far.Neuropediatrics. 2002; 33: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), we examined the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system of E18 embryos. The dopaminergic projections to the striatum appeared normal in both homozygous mutants (Figure 3E), further illustrating normal circuitry development in these torsinA mutant mice. Several lines of evidence indicate that torsinA functions in the nuclear envelope lumen (Gerace, 2004Gerace L. TorsinA and torsion dystonia: Unraveling the architecture of the nuclear envelope.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 8839-8840Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, Goodchild and Dauer, 2004Goodchild R.E. Dauer W.T.

Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 7612-7617Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Furthermore, disease mutant torsinA abnormally accumulates in the nuclear envelope in cells derived from DYT1 dystonia patients (Goodchild and Dauer, 2004Goodchild R.E. Dauer W.T. Mislocalization to the nuclear envelope: An effect of the dystonia causing torsinA mutation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 847-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that nuclear envelope dysfunction may contribute to disease pathogenesis in DYT1 dystonia. We therefore examined the nuclear envelope in both lines of torsinA mutant mice. This analysis revealed severe abnormalities of nuclear envelope ultrastructure in the CNS of both Tor1a−/− and Tor1aΔgag/Δgag mice (Figures 4A and 4B), while the main endoplasmic reticulum appears relatively unaffected (Figure 4C). In both lines, the lumen of the neuronal nuclear envelope contains large numbers of vesicles (Figures 4A and 4B) that appear to derive from the inner nuclear membrane (arrowhead in Figure 4E). The similarly appearing membrane abnormalities of Tor1a−/− and Tor1aΔgag/Δgag neurons again suggested that the Δgag mutation is a loss-of-function allele, prompting us to examine the nuclear envelope morphology of Tor1a+/−, Tor1aΔgag/−, and Tor1aΔgag/+ animals. Nuclear membrane abnormalities indistinguishable from those in Tor1a−/− and Tor1aΔgag/Δgag animals were present in the CNS of Tor1aΔgag/− mice. However, nuclear membrane abnormalities were not present in Tor1a+/− or Tor1aΔgag/+ heterozygous animals (Figure 4F), suggesting that there is sufficient torsinA function to maintain normal nuclear membrane morphology in these animals. We exploited the presence of this cellular phenotype to carefully test whether the effect of the DYT1 mutation was mediated entirely through its effect on protein levels (Figure 2) or whether it also affects the activity of ΔE-torsinA protein. To explore this question, we compared the steady-state levels of torsinA in Tor1aΔgag/Δgag brain with those of unaffected Tor1a+/− animals. Although both of these mice have similar steady-state levels of torsinA (Figures 4G and 2A), the knockin mice exhibit the complete null phenotype, while the heterozygous knockouts do not. Thus ΔE-torsinA appears to be a hypoactive, perhaps inactive, form of torsinA. Interestingly, the nuclear membranes of blood-brain barrier associated cells (both pericytes and endothelial cells) appeared normal (Figure 5A), despite the presence of abnormalities in adjacent neurons (asterisk in Figure 5A). We further assessed other CNS cell types and found that both astrocytes and oligodendrocytes also appeared normal (Figure 5B). We also failed to identify nuclear envelope changes in any non-nervous system tissue, despite examining connective, epithelial, and muscle cell types (Figure 5C). Thus, the nuclear envelope abnormalities appear to occur specifically in neurons, similar to the tissue selectivity characteristic of DYT1 dystonia. To explore whether torsinA function might be particularly important for certain neuronal populations, we performed a broad assessment of nuclear envelope ultrastructure in the CNS of E18 Tor1a−/− and Tor1aΔgag/Δgag mice. Nuclear envelope abnormalities were observed in multiple areas of the CNS, including neurons of the spinal cord, pons, frontal cortex, and hippocampus. Although the presence of luminal vesicles was widespread, we observed that large ventral horn neurons were particularly severely affected. Similar to these ultrastructural abnormalities, light microscopic analysis revealed that the nuclear shape of Tor1a−/− ventral horn neurons is abnormally convoluted compared with wild-type neurons (Figures 6A and 6B). However, the nuclear lamina remained intact in even these severely affected cells. In addition, it appears that nuclear lamins are not incorporated into the luminal vesicles because the lamina thickness did not differ between wild-type and Tor1a−/− ventral horn neurons. Despite the occurrence of luminal vesicles in other spinal cord neurons, we were unable to identify abnormalities in the nuclear lamina anywhere other than the worst affected ventral horn neurons (Figures 6C and 6D). Our broad assessment of nuclear envelope ultrastructure throughout the CNS also revealed that the severity and number of affected cells clearly increases in a rostral-caudal gradient, a pattern that mirrors the progression of CNS development. This apparent developmental dependence prompted us to focus on events occurring at the nuclear membrane during neuronal development. Interestingly, we never observed vesicles in the nuclear membranes of migrating cortical (E15) or spinal cord (E12) neurons; the nuclear membranes of all migrating cells were morphologically normal (Figure 7A and data not shown). While nuclear envelope vesicles were present at these relatively early points in development (E12 ventral spinal cord), they were observed exclusively in postmigratory cells (Figure 7B). The nucleus of migrating neurons is characteristically elongate and irregularly shaped, but the nuclei of postmigratory neurons are more rounded (Peters et al., 1991Peters A. Palay S.L. Webster H.deF. The Fine Structure of the Nervous System: Neurons and Their Supporting Cells. Oxford University Press, New York1991Google Scholar, Rakic et al., 1974Rakic P. Stensas L.J. Sayre E. Sidman R.L. Computer-aided three-dimensional reconstruction and quantitative analysis of cells from serial electron microscopic montages of foetal monkey brain.Nature. 1974; 250: 31-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) (Figure 7C). This transformation of nuclear morphology may reflect that different physical properties are required of migrating nuclei compared to the nuclei of mature postmigratory cells. These data suggested that torsinA or its interacting proteins might participate in the developmental transformation of nuclear shape. To begin to explore this notion, we examined the expression of torsinA and the torsinA-interacting proteins LAP1 and LULL1 during spinal cord development and maturation (Figure 7D). This analysis revealed that the expression of the largest LAP1 isoform, LAP1A, is upregulated at approximately the same time that nuclear envelope vesicles begin to form (Figure 7D). However, neither LAP1 nor LULL1 expression is altered in Tor1a−/− spinal cord (Figure 7E), despite the occurrence of nuclear envelope abnormalities in this tissue. We next examined the spinal cord of Tor1a−/− E15 and E18 embryos to assess the relationship of nuclear envelope abnormalities to postmigratory neuronal maturation. Ventral regions of the spinal cord develop several days prior to dorsal areas (Altman and Bayer, 2001Altman J. Bayer S.A. Development of the Human Spinal Cord. Oxford University Press, New York2001Google Scholar). Similar to this developmental gradient, we observed that at both ages there was a greater percentage of cells with nuclear envelope abnormalities in ventral compared to dorsal spinal cord (Figure 6, Figure 8A–8H). Furthermore, the severity of membrane abnormalities (number of vesicles/cell) worsened between E15 and E18 in both dorsal and ventral regions. The progressive increase in vesicle number suggests that the nuclear envelope retains and accumulates luminal vesicles over time. Consequently, it appears that nuclear membrane abnormalities develop following migration and worsen concurrent with subsequent events of neuronal maturation, including the transformation of nuclear shape. These data provide novel insight into the molecular mechanism of DYT1 dystonia, demonstrating that the DYT1 Δgag mutation acts through at least two independent mechanisms to impair torsinA function. Our data also demonstrate a unique requirement for torsinA function in neural tissue, the only tissue affected in the disease. Taken together, these findings suggest that loss of torsinA function within the neuronal nuclear envelope may contribute to the pathogenesis of DYT1 dystonia. The strikingly similar phenotypes of Tor1a−/−, Tor1aΔgag/−, and Tor1aΔgag/Δgag animals demonstrates that Tor1aΔgag is a loss-of-function allele. One mechanism by which the mutation causes loss of function is to reduce the steady-state levels of torsinA. This conclusion is supported by data showing a Tor1aΔgag-related gene dosage effect on torsinA levels in mice and decreased torsinA protein in skin fibroblasts derived from DYT1 patients. This effect on torsinA levels appears to be mediated entirely at the protein level, as Tor1aΔgag/Δgag mice have normal levels of torsinA mRNA. We have previously shown that torsinA is abnormally located in the nuclear envelope of fibroblasts derived from DYT1 patients (Goodchild and Dauer, 2004Goodchild R.E. Dauer W.T. Mislocalization to the nuclear envelope: An effect of the dystonia causing torsinA mutation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 847-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), suggesting that ΔE-torsinA protein remains in these cells. However, it is unclear whether lower torsinA levels reflect a selective decrease of ΔE-torsinA or whether the presence of ΔE-torsinA leads to a reduction of both wild-type and ΔE-torsinA. Unfortunately, currently available antisera are unable to distinguish between the single amino acid difference of wild-type and mutant protein, precluding further study of this issue at this time. Independent from its effect on torsinA levels, our data also demonstrate that the DYT1 Δgag mutation results in an intrinsically hypoactive, potentially inactive, form of torsinA. Central to this conclusion is the comparison between the Tor1a+/− and Tor1aΔgag/Δgag animals. While torsinA levels are similar in the nervous system of Tor1a+/− and Tor1aΔgag/Δgag mice, only Tor1aΔgag/Δgag mice display the characteristics of torsinA loss, namely perinatal lethality and neuronal nuclear membrane abnormalities. Thus ΔE-torsinA is less active than the wild-type protein. In fact, ΔE-torsinA in Tor1aΔgag/Δgag animals is unable to ameliorate any effect associated with the complete absence of torsinA, indicating that it could be inactive. Several lines of evidence from in vitro studies of torsinA suggest that a third mechanism may also reduce torsinA activity in the heterozygous state of DYT1 dystonia. AAA+ proteins typically operate as oligomers (Neuwald et al., 1999Neuwald A.F. Aravind L. Spouge J.L. Koonin E.V.

Cell Biol. 2000; 150: F13-F19Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and it has been shown that wild-type and ΔE-torsinA can coassemble into hetero-oligomers. Specifically, wild-type and ΔE-torsinA coimmunoprecipitate (Torres et al., 2004Torres G.E. Sweeney A.L. Beaulieu J.M. Shashidharan P. Caron M.G. Effect of torsinA on membrane proteins reveals a loss of function and a dominant-negative phenotype of the dystonia-associated DeltaE-torsinA mutant.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 15650-15655Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), and the presence of ΔE-torsinA causes wild-type protein to relocate to the nuclear envelope (Goodchild and Dauer, 2004Goodchild R.E. Dauer W.T. Mislocalization to the nuclear envelope: An effect of the dystonia causing torsinA mutation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 847-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Thus, our finding that ΔE-torsinA is a hypoactive torsinA isoform is consistent with the hypothesis that ΔE-torsinA expression in DYT1 dystonia further reduces torsinA activity via a dominant-negative mechanism. However, our experiments do not specifically address this issue. Previously described animal models of DYT1 dystonia have been mostly limited to transgenic overexpression of ΔE-torsinA (Cao et al., 2005Cao S. Gelwix C.C. Caldwell K.A. Caldwell G.A.

Neurol. 2005; 196: 452-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). While overexpressing ΔE-torsinA on a wild-type background has led to varying behavioral and cellular effects, none of these studies addressed the effect of the DYT1 mutation on normal torsinA function or assessed nuclear envelope ultrastructure. Although it is possible to model a dominant effect in a transgenic study, it is not generally possible to distinguish between a dominant gain or loss of function in these experiments. In addition, the other aspects of the Δgag mutation described here (e.g., decreased total levels of torsinA protein) are not modeled by transgenic ΔE-torsinA expression. To date, all transgenic animals have been viable, unlike Tor1aΔgag/− and Tor1aΔgag/Δgag mice, and the nuclear membrane abnormalities seen here have not been reported. Our data also indicate a developmental requirement for torsinA function, so differences between transgenic and gene-targeted models might relate to the developmental timing of transgene expression. The multiple mechanisms by which the DYT1 mutation can decrease torsinA function, including the potential for a dominant-negative mechanism, raise the question of why nuclear envelope vesicles do not develop in Tor1aΔgag/+ mice. One possibility is that these morphological abnormalities only develop in the complete absence of torsinA activity and are therefore not a sensitive measure of torsinA function. This notion is supported by the finding that nuclear envelope vesicles do not occur in heterozygous null mice, which have ∼50% of normal torsinA levels. Complete loss of torsinA activity is unlikely in Tor1aΔgag/+ mice (or DYT1 patients) because of the presence of wild-type torsinA. Unfortunately, it will not be possible to definitively determine whether ΔE-torsinA exerts a dominant-negative effect until the normal cellular activity of torsinA can be quantitatively assessed. The notion that there is a relatively mild biological disturbance in DYT1 dystonia is consistent with clinical features of the disease. The DYT1 mutation is roughly 30% penetrant (∼70% of Δgag carriers do not develop dystonia), and the majority of patients who do develop dystonic symptoms exhibit relatively localized symptoms. In fact, only about 10% of Δgag carriers develop debilitating dystonia. These observations suggest that DYT1 patients or heterozygous knockin mice are likely to exhibit a rather subtle cellular disturbance. Independent of the severity of the cellular abnormality underlying DYT1 dystonia, the fact that the multiple effects of the Δgag mutation likely combine to impair torsinA activity argues that the normal cellular action of torsinA is reduced in DYT1 dystonia. Our observations indicate that the nuclear envelope is a key site of torsinA activity, raising the possibility that this organelle may be preferentially disrupted in DYT1 patients. Two features of the nuclear membrane phenotype described here are consistent with the notion that nuclear envelope dysfunction contributes to the symptoms of DYT1 dystonia. First, the symptoms of the disease and the nuclear membrane vesicles are both exclusively neuronal, despite the widespread expression of torsinA. Second, the onset of disease symptoms and the appearance of nuclear envelope vesicles both exhibit a developmental dependence. Thus, we hypothesize that a more moderate insult to the biological pathway responsible for nuclear membrane vesicle formation may contribute to the symptoms of DYT1 dystonia. The nuclear envelope and endoplasmic reticulum form a continuous membrane system. Nuclear pores and lamin binding transmembrane proteins are specifically found in the nuclear envelope, but other functions and proteins occur in both areas. The membrane abnormalities caused by torsinA deficiency appear to be specifically located in the nuclear envelope lumen, and the peripheral endoplasmic reticulum generally appears normal. However, it is possible that torsinA mutation disrupts a process common to the endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear envelope. The possibility that a specialized aspect of neuronal development requires proteins of the nuclear envelope has not been previously considered. We find that nuclear envelope vesicles develop coincident with postmigratory transformation of neuronal nuclear morphology, raising the possibility that torsinA normally participates in this poorly understood process. Consistent with this notion, a number of AAA+ proteins are involved in membrane-localized events such as membrane fusion (Neuwald et al., 1999Neuwald A.F. Aravind L. Spouge J.L. Koonin E.V. AAA+: A class of chaperone-like ATPases associated with the assembly, operation, and disassembly of protein complexes.Genome Res. 1999; 9: 27-43PubMed Google Scholar, Ogura and Wilkinson, 2001Ogura T.

Cell Biol. 2000; 150: F13-F19Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, torsinA interacts with the luminal domain of the integral inner nuclear membrane protein LAP1 (Goodchild and Dauer, 2005Goodchild R.E. Dauer W.T. The AAA+ protein torsinA interacts with a conserved domain present in LAP1 and a novel ER protein.J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), whose structural features and links to nuclear lamins (Martin et al., 1995Martin L. Crimaudo C. Gerace L. cDNA cloning and characterization of lamina-associated polypeptide 1C (LAP1C), an integral protein of the inner nuclear membrane.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8822-8828Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) are consistent with a potential role in this process. It is also possible that torsinA is involved in nucleokinesis, a key component of neuronal migration, in which coupling of the nucleus, centrosome, and microtubules are used to generate nuclear movement (Tsai and Gleeson, 2005Tsai L.H. Gleeson J.G. Nucleokinesis in neuronal migration.Neuron. 2005; 46: 383-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a C. elegans torsinA homolog, ooc-5, is important for the related process of nuclear rotation in early stages of embryo development (Basham and Rose, 1999Basham S.E. Rose L.S. Mutations in ooc-5 and ooc-3 disrupt oocyte formation and the reestablishment of asymmetric PAR protein localization in two-cell Caenorhabditis elegans embryos.Dev. Biol. 1999; 215: 253-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). While neuronal migration appears normal in the torsinA mutants, torsinA may be involved in disassembly of the nucleokinesis machinery, the uncoordinated dismantling of which could lead to abnormal shear forces. Taken together, our data highlight that the nuclear envelope undergoes a dynamic reorganization during neuronal maturation and suggest that alterations in this process may underlie human neurodevelopmental disease. All Tor1a mutant embryos were delivered by caesarian section from timed pregnant female mice housed on a standard light-dark cycle. The day following overnight mating was designated as embryonic day 0 (E0). Routine histological evaluation was performed on sections of formaldehyde-fixed embryos stained with haematoxylin and eosin. Embryos were prepared for immunohistochemistry by transcardial perfusion with 4% formaldehyde. Tissue was cryoprotected using 30% sucrose, frozen, and 20 μm sections stored at –80°C until required. For immunolabeling visualized using peroxidase and 3, 3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB), sections were post-fixed for 10 min, incubated in 0.3% H2O2, incubated with the avidin-biotin kit (Vector Labs), and permeabilized using 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS, including 10% normal donkey serum. Primary antibody incubation was performed overnight at 4°C in permeabilization solution. The following day, sections were washed in PBS, incubated for 1 hr in biotinylated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch), washed, incubated in ABC reagent (Vector Labs), and developed using DAB substrate (Vector Labs). Immunofluorescent labeling was performed similarly, except that sections were immediately permeabilized and blocked following fixation. Primary antibody incubations were performed at 4°C overnight, then sections were washed and incubated with Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Sections were subsequently washed, incubated with NeuroTrace 500/525 green fluorescent Nissl stain (Invitrogen/Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and coverslip mounted using Vectashield with DAPI (Vector Laboratories). Images were obtained using a LSM510 multiphoton microscope (Zeiss). All animal experiments were performed in accordance with National Health Guidelines for the use of live animals, and the animal protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Columbia University. Protein lysates were produced by sonicating tissues in 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 1% SDS, 150 mM NaCl, and complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma). Protein concentration was determined using BCA assay (Pierce). Lysates were diluted in Laemmli sample buffer and used in SDS-PAGE. Total RNA was extracted from tissue using Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Northern blots were hybridized using ExpressHyb solution (Clontech) and 32P-labeled DNA probes. Full-length coding cDNA sequences for mouse torsinA were used as templates in random priming reactions using Random Priming Kit (Roche). Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) were prepared after removing the head and liver from E13 embryos. Tissue was disrupted by three passages through an 18 gauge needle, and cells were plated in DMEM containing 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Astrocytes were prepared from E18 frontal cortex that was minced, incubated in 0.25% trypsin for 15 min and dissociated by passaging through fire-polished glass pipettes of decreasing diameter. Cells were plated and grown in MEM media containing 10% FBS. Rabbit anti-torsinA was a kind gift from Brett Lauring (Columbia University). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against mouse LAP1 and LULL1 have been described previously (Goodchild and Dauer, 2005Goodchild R.E. Dauer W.T. The AAA+ protein torsinA interacts with a conserved domain present in LAP1 and a novel ER protein.J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Monoclonal anti-dopamine transporter and rabbit anti-synapsin were from Chemicon. Mouse monoclonal anti-myc was from Clontech, β-actin from Sigma, and anti-GAPH was from Ambion. Goat polyclonal anti-laminB was from Santa-Cruz. Tissue was prepared by transcardial perfusion of embryos with 4% paraformaldehyde/3% glutaraldehyde in 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), followed by postfixation in the same solution. Cultured fibroblasts and astrocytes were also fixed in this solution, then scraped from the dish with a Teflon scrapper and pelleted before dicing into small pieces. All samples were postfixed with 1% osmium tetroxide in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) on ice for 1 hr. Samples were then treated with 0.5% aqueous uranyl acetate, dehydrated in graded alcohol, treated with propylene oxide, and embedded in Embed 812 (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Fort Washington, PA) The resin was polymerized in a 60 degree oven for 2–3 days. Sections were cut with a Dupont diamond knife on Reichert-Jung UltraCut E ultramicrotome, collected on copper grids, and doubly stained with saturated aqueous uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Ultrathin sections were viewed using a JEM-1200EX electron microscope manufactured by JEOL, Inc.

This inhibition is greatly diminished during heightened emotional states due to dopamine release. However, dopamine excites most amygdala interneurons, suggesting that this dopaminergic gate may be mediated by an unknown subpopulation of interneurons. We hypothesized that this gate is mediated by paracapsular intercalated cells, a subset of interneurons that are innervated by both cortical and mesolimbic dopaminergic afferents. Using transgenic mice that express GFP in GABAergic interneurons, we show that paracapsular cells form a network surrounding the basolateral complex of the amygdala. We found that they provide feedforward inhibition into the basolateral and the central amygdala. Dopamine hyperpolarized paracapsular cells through D1 receptors and substantially suppressed their excitability, resulting in a disinhibition of the basolateral and central nuclei.

Suppression of the paracapsular system by dopamine provides a compelling neural mechanism for the increased affective behavior observed during stress or other hyperdopaminergic states. The amygdala plays a crucial role in producing emotionally appropriate behavior in response to sensory input, in particular to threatening stimuli (LeDoux, 2000LeDoux J.E. Emotion circuits in the brain.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 23: 155-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (5778) Google Scholar). For this process, an intact inhibitory system is essential as illustrated by the fact that selective blocking of inhibition (e.g., by infusion of GABAA receptor blockers in the amygdala) produces an uncontrolled anxiety-like state (Sanders and Shekhar, 1995Sanders S.K. Shekhar A. Regulation of anxiety by GABAA receptors in the rat amygdala.Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav. 1995; 52: 701-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Previous findings indicate that cortical afferents drive inhibition in the amygdala by activating local interneurons (Lang and Pare, 1998Lang E.J. Pare D.

Stimulation of medial prefrontal cortex decreases the responsiveness of central amygdala output neurons.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 8800-8807PubMed Google Scholar). However, in situations in which an emotional response is important, cortically mediated inhibition must be lifted to facilitate amygdala function. Several lines of evidence suggest that the modulatory neurotransmitter dopamine (DA) may act as switch between the cortically controlled and the disinhibited states of the amygdala: (1) DA is increased under stress in the amygdala (Inglis and Moghaddam, 1999Inglis F.M.

Lett. 2005; 379: 37-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), thus available in emotionally charged situations; (2) DA produces disinhibition in the BLA (Grace and Rosenkranz, 2002Grace A.A.

Kokkinidis L.

LeDoux J.E. Inhibition of the mesoamygdala dopaminergic pathway impairs the retrieval of conditioned fear associations.Behav. Neurosci. 1999; 113: 891-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). DA receptors can be classified into two main groups with the DA D1 receptors comprising the subtypes D1 and D5, and the DA D2 receptors comprising the subtypes D2, D3, and D4 (Missale et al., 1998Missale C. Nash S.R. Robinson S.W. Jaber M. Caron M.G. Dopamine receptors: from structure to function.Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 189-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (2573) Google Scholar). In particular DA D1 receptors appear to be essential for disinhibition of the amygdala, as prefrontal cortical control over the amygdala is strongly reduced through DA D1 receptor activation (Rosenkranz and Grace, 2002Rosenkranz J.A. Grace A.A. Cellular mechanisms of infralimbic and prelimbic prefrontal cortical inhibition and dopaminergic modulation of basolateral amygdala neurons in vivo.J.

Further evidence for the importance of the DA D1 receptor system stems from behavioral studies, in which activation of these receptors by systemic application of the selective agonists SKF38393 augments both fear learning and expression (Borowski and Kokkinidis, 1998Borowski T.B.

On a cellular level, disinhibition of the BLA can either result from reduced excitatory input to interneurons or from a direct suppression of amygdala interneuron excitability. However, interneurons within the BLA were shown to be depolarized by DA or DA D1 receptor agonists, increasing rather than reducing inhibitory activity (Kröner et al., 2004Kröner S. Rosenkranz A.J.

Cellular mechanisms of infralimbic and prelimbic prefrontal cortical inhibition and dopaminergic modulation of basolateral amygdala neurons in vivo.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 324-337PubMed Google Scholar). This raises the question as to whether a subpopulation of amygdala interneurons exists that is differently modulated by DA and mediates cortical control of the amygdala. In the rat amygdala, the so-called paracapsular intercalated cells (pcs) (Alheid et al., 1995Alheid G.F. de Olmos J.S. Beltramino C.A. Amygdala and Extended Amygdala.in: Paxinos G. The Rat Nervous System. Academic Press, San Diego1995: 495-578Google Scholar, Millhouse, 1986Millhouse O.E. The intercalated cells of the amygdala.J. Comp. Neurol. 1986; 247: 246-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) receive the densest afferents from the mesencephalic DAergic system with a high number of somatic and perisomatic synapses and show the highest levels of DA D1 receptor immunoreactivity and DA D1 receptor mRNA (Asan, 1998Asan E.

The dopamine D1 receptor-rich main and paracapsular intercalated nerve cell groups of the rat amygdala: relationship to the dopamine innervation.Neuroscience. 2003; 119: 733-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Functional data on these interneurons is scant except for the subgroup forming an inhibitory gate between BLA and CeA presumably under cortical control (Pare et al., 2003Pare D. Royer S. Smith Y. Lang E.J. Contextual inhibitory gating of impulse traffic in the intra-amygdaloid network.Ann. N Y Acad. Sci. 2003; 985: 78-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, Royer et al., 1999Royer S. Martina M. Pare D. An inhibitory interface gates impulse traffic between the input and output stations of the amygdala.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 10575-10583PubMed Google Scholar). For the second prominent subgroup, located along the external capsule, physiological data are largely missing. Given the occurrence of pcs along the fiber bundles carrying cortical afferents together with their dense dopaminergic innervation, we hypothesized that these cells are substantially involved in mediating the prominent cortical feedforward inhibition and its modulation by DA observed in the amygdala. Using mice that express GFP in GABAergic interneurons (Tamamaki et al., 2003Tamamaki N. Yanagawa Y. Tomioka R. Miyazaki J. Obata K. Kaneko T. Green fluorescent protein expression and colocalization with calretinin, parvalbumin, and somatostatin in the GAD67-GFP knock-in mouse.J. Comp. Neurol. 2003; 467: 60-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar), we were able to identify pcs in acute brain slices and study their connectivity and response to DA. Here we demonstrate that pcs form an interconnected system provide feedforward inhibition into the BLA complex and the CeA and show a modulation by DA and DA D1 agonists that is not found in other neurons in the amygdala. GAD-GFP mice (Tamamaki et al., 2003Tamamaki N. Yanagawa Y. Tomioka R. Miyazaki J. Obata K. Kaneko T. Green fluorescent protein expression and colocalization with calretinin, parvalbumin, and somatostatin in the GAD67-GFP knock-in mouse.J. Comp. Neurol. 2003; 467: 60-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar) express green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of the promotor for GAD67, a key enzyme for the synthesis of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). With help of these mice, two types of interneurons could be distinguished in the amygdala: “classical” interneurons that occur loosely scattered within the BLA and densely packed clusters of smaller interneurons that are located along the external capsule and along the medial border between the BLA and central amygdala (Figures 1A and 1C). Consistent with location and morphology, we identified the latter as pcs (Alheid et al., 1995Alheid G.F. de Olmos J.S. Beltramino C.A. Amygdala and Extended Amygdala.in: Paxinos G. The Rat Nervous System. Academic Press, San Diego1995: 495-578Google Scholar, Millhouse, 1986Millhouse O.E. The intercalated cells of the amygdala.J. Comp. Neurol. 1986; 247: 246-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) with a lateral (lpcs [∗]) and a medial (mpcs [∗∗]) subdivision. These subdivisions were linked by a cell band stretching across the BLA (Figure 1C, downward arrow), presumably constituting a third group of pcs. Characteristic for pcs is their small size (5–8 μm in diameter, n = 27), a poorly developed dendritic tree, and their occurrence in tightly packed nuclei (Figures 1D and 1E). A three-dimensional reconstruction of the pc system revealed that they form an inhibitory sheath around the BLA (Supplemental Data available with this article online). In immunohistochemical studies, subsets of BLA interneurons were immunopositive for typical interneuron markers (calbindin, calretinin, parvalbumin, NPY, cholecystokinin, somatostatin), yet none of these markers labeled pcs (data not shown). In a first set of experiments, we examined the electrophysiological properties of lpcs, mpcs, and classical BLA interneurons as shown in Table 1. Compared to classical interneurons, pcs exhibited broader spikes, less pronounced afterhyperpolarizations, and lower sustained spike frequencies. These features were especially prominent in lpcs; in fact, their spiking pattern was reminiscent of the one observed in pyramidal cells, whereas the firing pattern of mpcs more closely resembled the one observed in other BLA interneurons (Figures 2A–2D). The passive membrane properties of pcs such as input resistance and whole-cell capacitance were typical for small neurons, with the lpcs possessing even higher input resistance and lower whole-cell capacitance than mpcs (see Table 1).Table 1Electrophysiological Properties of Lateral and Medical Paracapsular Intercalated Cells and Interneurons within the Basolateral AmygdalalpcmpcIN BLAavgSEMnavgSEMnavgSEMnParameterRMP (mV)−781.344−781.636−772.825lpc ≈ mpc ≈ IN BLARin (MOhm)865314465749363413725lpc > mpc > IN BLACap (pF)57.11.244593.136937.225lpc ≈ mpc < IN BLApeak f (Hz)19.91.24324.81.93645.4425lpc ≈ mpc < IN BLAsustained f (Hz)14.80.354319.413639.50.625lpc < mpc < IN BLAf adapt (rel)0.750.03430.780.05360.80.0225lpc ≈ mpc ≈ IN BLAhw first (ms)1.70.032431.20.034361.20.0925lpc > mpc ≈ IN BLAhw sust (ms)2.850.053431.90.093361.370.03725lpc > mpc > IN BLAAP first (mV)671.443681.436701.925lpc ≈ mpc ≈ IN BLAAP sust (mV)510.843541.236600.525lpc < mpc < IN BLAWe measured resting membrane potential (RMP), input resistance (Rin), whole-cell capacitance (Cap), peak firing frequency—first three action potentials (peak f), sustained firing frequency—last four action potentials (sustained f), frequency adaptation (sustained frequency divided by the peak frequency), action potential half-width of the first action potential (hw first), action potential half-width of the last action potential (hw sust), amplitude of the action potential from the beginning of the upstroke to the peak for the first action potential (AP first) and for the last action potential (AP sust).

Previous anatomical and electrophysiological studies demonstrated that mpcs receive excitatory input from BLA projection cells (Royer et al., 1999Royer S. Martina M. Pare D.

In addition, studies by Quirk et al., 2003Quirk G.J. Likhtik E. Pelletier J.G. Pare D. Stimulation of medial prefrontal cortex decreases the responsiveness of central amygdala output neurons.J.

Infralimbic cortex activation increases c-Fos expression in intercalated neurons of the amygdala.Neuroscience. 2005; 132: 943-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar imply cortical activation of mpcs. As lpcs are located in close proximity to the external capsule, we investigated whether they are also innervated by cortical afferents. Individual lpcs were recorded in current-clamp mode, while cortical afferents were activated through a bipolar platinum-iridium electrode placed onto the external capsule (Humeau et al., 2003Humeau Y. Shaban H. Bissiere S. Luthi A. Presynaptic induction of heterosynaptic associative plasticity in the mammalian brain.Nature. 2003; 426: 841-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Stimulation of the fiber bundle resulted in EPSPs of sufficient size to fire lpcs (n = 5) (Figures 2E and 2F). To confirm the specificity of cortical innervation, the external capsule was severed with the result that stimulation distal of the cut no longer evoked any synaptic response in the lpc, though proximal stimulation still generated robust excitation (n = 4) (Figures 2G and 2H). Either proximal stimulation or increased stimulation intensity recruited IPSPs in addition to EPSPs, indicating that lpcs receive excitatory cortical innervation and lateral inhibition from other interneurons, reminiscent of the situation in mpcs (Royer et al., 1999Royer S. Martina M. Pare D. An inhibitory interface gates impulse traffic between the input and output stations of the amygdala.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 10575-10583PubMed Google Scholar). A first indication concerning their target cells was obtained by biocytin-filled lpcs, which send axonal collaterals into the BLA. To verify functional connectivity, we recorded from connected lpc-BLA projection cell pairs. Lpcs were recorded in whole-cell current-clamp mode, and presynaptic action potentials were elicited by brief (1 ms) current injections. We recorded from 134 lpc-BLA projection cell pairs; we detected synaptic connections in 7 of these. The amplitude of unitary IPSCs (uIPSCs) was small (16 ± 1.7 pA), and their kinetics were slow (rise time: 5.0 ± 0.7 ms, decay time: 46.8 ± 13.1 ms) (Figures 3B and 3C). Signal size and kinetics strongly imply dendritic, rather than somatic synaptic contacts between lpcs and BLA principal cells, which is in accordance with the distal axo-dendritic contact found in biocytin-filled cell pairs (Figure 3A). Such modest IPSCs may only have limited inhibitory impact on their targets, but if multiple lpcs from a single cluster project to a single BLA principal cell, this could considerably enhance the inhibitory effectiveness of lpcs. We tested this hypothesis by stimulating lpc clusters with an extracellular stimulus electrode and recording IPSCs from a single BLA projection cell (n = 4) (Figure 3D). To ensure local activation of lpcs, an ACFS-filled glass electrode with a small tip was used and recordings were performed in the presence of kynurenate (3 mM). In all experiments, increasing the stimulation current resulted in a slowly growing inhibitory response due to gradual recruitment of lpcs and multiple innervation of the target cell by lpcs (Figures 3E and 3F). So far we have shown that lpcs are activated by cortical afferents and project to BLA projection cells. However, some BLA interneurons are also cortically activated (Lang and Pare, 1998Lang E.J. Pare D. Synaptic responsiveness of interneurons of the cat lateral amygdaloid nucleus.Neuroscience. 1998; 83: 877-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, Szinyei et al., 2000Szinyei C. Heinbockel T. Montagne J. Pape H.C. Putative cortical and thalamic inputs elicit convergent excitation in a population of GABAergic interneurons of the lateral amygdala.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8909-8915PubMed Google Scholar), raising the question as to which amount of feedforward inhibition is mediated by lpcs. To assess their contribution to cortical feedforward inhibition, we stimulated afferents in the external capsule while selectively blocking excitatory synaptic transmission onto lpcs with brief (1–2 s) focal puffs of the AMPA/kainate receptor blocker NBQX (1 mM) (Figures 3G–3J) (Royer et al., 1999Royer S. Martina M. Pare D. An inhibitory interface gates impulse traffic between the input and output stations of the amygdala.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 10575-10583PubMed Google Scholar). These puffs caused a transient reduction in the IPSC amplitude of BLA projection cells that were recorded in the vicinity of the superfused cluster (Figures 3H and 3I). On average the IPSC amplitude was reduced to 31% ± 7% of pre-application values (n = 5, p < 0.05) (Figure 3J), showing that the predominant part of cortical feedforward inhibition on BLA pyramidal cells is carried by lpcs. Since cortically mediated inhibition is strongly sensitive to DA as shown by Rosenkranz and Grace, 2002Rosenkranz J.A. Grace A.A. Cellular mechanisms of infralimbic and prelimbic prefrontal cortical inhibition and dopaminergic modulation of basolateral amygdala neurons in vivo.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 324-337PubMed Google Scholar, we next studied the response of the paracapsular system to DA. Consistent with previous data obtained in the rat (Asan, 1998Asan E. The catecholaminergic innervation of the rat amygdala.Adv. Anat. Embryol. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), dense tyrosine hydroxylase-positive plexuses were found within lpc and mpc clusters in GAD-GFP mice (Figures 4A and 4B). We assessed the physiological effect of this prominent innervation by applying DA (20–30 μM DA was used throughout the study) while recording from a pc (mpc and lpc) held in current-clamp. In lpcs, bath application of DA caused a hyperpolarization of the resting membrane potential (RMP) from −71.6 ± 1.3 mV to −76.4 ± 1.4 mV (n = 8, p < 0.01) and in mpcs from −73.3 ± 1.3 mV to −77.9 ± 1.4 mV (n = 12, p < 0.01) (Figure 4C). The effect was reversible upon washout. No significant difference in the amount of hyperpolarization was observed between lpcs and mpcs, and therefore data of both groups were pooled for subsequent experiments. To examine whether DA directly acts on pc membrane potential and to study the ensuing effect on pc excitability, we repeated the experiments under complete block of ionotropic glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptic transmission (3 mM kynurenate, 100 μM picrotoxin) and evoked action potentials via somatic current injections. Bath application of DA hyperpolarized pcs by −4.7 ± 0.4 mV (−74.5 ± 1.2 mV to −79.3 ± 1.1 mV) (n = 20, p < 0.01), accompanied by a reduction of input resistance (810 ± 100 MΩ to 564 ± 45 MΩ, n = 20, p < 0.01) and of evoked spikes from 6.5 ± 1.1 to 1.6 ± 0.6 per trial (n = 20, p < 0.01) (Figures 4E and 4F). In another series of experiments, we applied DA in the presence of TTX (1 μM), which completely abolished network activity in the slice, and again measured a significant hyperpolarization (−4.6 ± 0.4 mV, n = 10, p < 0.01). As synaptic activity was not necessary for hyperpolarization, and activation of DA receptors on these cells led to a marked decrease in input resistance, we concluded that DA attenuates the excitability of pcs via a direct postsynaptic effect by increasing a hyperpolarizing conductance. In contrast to the inhibitory effect of DA on pcs, we found that classical BLA interneurons were invariably depolarized by DA (−74.4 ± 1.6 mV to −68.7 ± 0.5 mV, n = 15, p < 0.01) and exhibited heightened excitability reflected by an increase in the number of spikes (4.4 ± 1.6 to 14.5 ± 3.5, n = 8, p < 0.05) without significant alteration in input resistance (295 ± 84 to 293 ± 86 MΩ, n = 8, p > 0.05) (Figures 4G and 4H). This result is in agreement with a previous study, which showed that DA receptor activation increased evoked firing in fast-spiking BLA interneurons (Kröner et al., 2004Kröner S. Rosenkranz A.J. Grace A.A. Barrionuevo G. Dopamine modulates excitability of basolateral amygdala neurons in vitro.J. Neurophysiol. 2004; 843: 1-48Google Scholar). Next, we investigated the effect of DA on cortically activated lpcs. We recorded from individual lpcs while stimulating cortical afferents in the external capsule with the stimulus strength set to evoke an EPSP large enough to fire an action potential in ∼50% of the trials. Application of DA led to hyperpolarization accompanied by a significant drop in the likelihood of action potential firing (51% ± 9% before DA versus 12% ± 7% after DA, n = 4, p < 0.05) (Figures 4I and 4J) while leaving the evoked EPSP largely intact. This result demonstrates that DA also depresses cortically evoked action potentials in lpcs. We determined the DA receptor subtype that mediates the hyperpolarization caused by DA (−4.7 ± 0.4 mV, n = 20) by bath applying specific DA receptor agonists and antagonists in the presence of kynurenate (3 mM) and picrotoxin (100 μM) to isolate a direct effect on the membrane potential. The DA D1 agonist dihydrexidine, but not the DA D2 agonist quinpirole, mimicked the effects of DA on membrane potential in both lpcs and mpcs (Figure 5). Dihydrexidine (2 μM) led to a hyperpolarization of −4.4 ± 0.6 mV (n = 12, p < 0.01), a concomitant loss of input resistance (753 ± 51 MΩ to 532 ± 87 MΩ, n = 12, p < 0.05), and a decrease in the number of evoked action potentials (9.2 ± 2.0 to 4.0 ± 1.6, n = 12, p < 0.05) (Figures 5A and 5B). Consistently, DA combined with the DA D2 antagonist sulpiride (5 μM) hyperpolarized the resting membrane potential (−4.2 ± 1.3 mV, n = 8, p < 0.05), whereas quinpirole (1 μM) as well as DA together with the DA D1 antagonist SCH 23390 (5 μM) did not significantly alter the membrane potential (0.7± 0.8 mV, n = 10, p > 0.05 and −0.5 ± 0.8 mV, n = 9, p > 0.05, respectively) (Figure 5C). DA and dihydrexidine caused a marked decrease in input resistance, suggestive of the activation of an additional membrane conductance. Classically, DA D1 receptors activate adenyl cyclase via Gs or Golf, but other types of coupling, e.g., to G protein-coupled inward rectifier potassium (GIRK) channels have been observed in striatal cells (Pacheco-Cano et al., 1996Pacheco-Cano M.T. Bargas J. Hernandez-Lopez S. Tapia D. Galarraga E. Inhibitory action of dopamine involves a subthreshold Cs(+)-sensitive conductance in neostriatal neurons.Exp. Brain Res. 1996; 110: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the hypothesis that DA activates a GIRK current in pcs. Current-voltage curves were obtained (n = 6) using a voltage ramp from −100 to −60 mV"

Here we report the molecular mechanism for S-nitrosylation of methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT) of Arabidopsis thaliana, thereby presenting the first detailed characterization of S-nitrosylation in plants. We cloned three MAT isoforms of Arabidopsis and tested the effect of NO on the activity of the purified, recombinant proteins. Our data showed that incubation with GSNO resulted in blunt, reversible inhibition of MAT1, whereas MAT2 and MAT3 were not significantly affected. Cys-114 of MAT1 was identified as the most promising target of NO-induced inhibition of MAT1, because this residue is absent in MAT2 and MAT3. Structural analysis of MAT1 revealed that Cys-114 is located nearby the putative substrate binding site of this enzyme. Furthermore, Cys-114 is flanked by S-nitrosylation-promoting amino acids. The inhibitory effect of GSNO was drastically reduced when Cys-114 of MAT1 was replaced by arginine, and mass spectrometric analyses of Cys-114-containing peptides obtained after chymotryptic digestion demonstrated that Cys-114 of MAT1 is indeed S-nitrosylated. Because MAT catalyzes the synthesis of the ethylene precursor S-adenosylmethionine and NO is known to influence ethylene production in plants, this enzyme probably mediates the cross-talk between ethylene and NO signaling.

NO is a lipophilic, highly reactive gaseous molecule that plays important roles in regulation of stomatal closure (1.Neill S.J. Desikan R. Clarke A. Hancock J.T.

Plant Biol. 2003; 54: 109-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). Because NO is involved in such many different processes it is not surprising that multiple NO sources are identified in plants providing NO for regulating the different physiological reactions. Recently, a hormone-activated NO-producing enzyme, which is involved in disease resistance, was found in Arabidopsis (8.Guo F.-Q. Okamoto M. Crawford M.J. Science. 2003; 302: 100-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar, 9.Zeidler D. Zähringer U. Gerber I. Dubery I. Hartung T. Bors W. Hutzler P. Durner J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Next to this enzymatic sources, non-enzymatic production of NO via reduction of apoplastic nitrite is also described (13.Bethke P.C. Badger M.R. Jones R.L. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 332-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar).Despite the multiplex importance of NO, less is known about the targets of this redox molecule in plant metabolism. Many of the biological functions of NO arise as a direct consequence of chemical reactions between proteins and NO or NO oxides generated as NO/O2 or NO/superoxide reaction products. Different types of NO-dependent protein modification are described. NO is a precursor of the reactive nitrating species, peroxynitrite and nitrogen dioxide, which modify proteins to generate 3-nitrotyrosine as it is shown for the tyrosine residues 161 and 357 of α-tubulin (14.Tedeschi G.

Protein nitration is an irreversible reaction, which is of importance for pathophysiological but probably not for signaling. Furthermore, NO can bind to metal ions of heme groups as it is reported for the activation of guanylate cyclase (15.Russwurm M. Koesling D. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4443-4450Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 16.Brandish P.E. Buechler W. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16898-16907Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) or it can form dinitrosyl complexes together with iron ions and low molecular weight thiols. Latter reactions seem to be important for iron uptake, trafficking, storage, and delivery in plant mesophyll cells (17.Graziano M. Beligni M.V. Lamattina L. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 1852-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 18.Graziano M. Lamattina L. Trends Plant Sci. 2005; 10: 4-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Finally, NO can react with the thiol group of cysteine residues to form S-nitrosothiols (S-nitrosylation) as it is described e.g. for mammalian methionine adenosyltransferase (19.Perez-Mato I.

Sun J. Xu L. Stamler J.S. Meissner G. Cell. 2000; 102: 499-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Because of their reactivity with intracellular reducing agents like ascorbic acid or glutathione, and with reduced metal ions, especially Cu+, the half-lives of S-nitrosothiols are very short (from seconds to a few minutes). This lability makes protein S-nitrosylation a very sensitive regulation mechanism, and there are many reports about the importance of this cysteine-dependent redox-based mechanism for controlling different cellular processes in animals (21.Mannick J.B. Schonhoff C.M. Free Radic. Res. 2004; 38: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 22.Martinez-Ruiz A. Lamas S. Cardiovasc.

Interv. 2003; 3: 253-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar).Because most proteins possess cysteine residues, substrate specificity is a very important feature of endogenous protein S-nitrosylation. This includes structural factors that influence the susceptibility to S-nitrosylation like surrounding acidic or basic amino acids and the presence of a hydrophobic environment that enables the formation of S-nitrosylating species via the reaction between oxygen and NO (25.Stamler J.S. Toone E.J. Lipton S.A. Sucher N.J. Neuron. 1997; 18: 691-696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Additionally, trans-S-nitrosylation from the in vivo NO donor nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) 2The abbreviations used are: GSNO, nitrosoglutathione; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MS, mass spectrometry; MAT, methionine adenosyltransferase; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; DTNB, 5,5′-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid; DTT, dithiothreitol; AdoMet, S-adenosylmethionine; ACC, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxlic acid.2The abbreviations used are: GSNO, nitrosoglutathione; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MS, mass spectrometry; MAT, methionine adenosyltransferase; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; DTNB, 5,5′-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid; DTT, dithiothreitol; AdoMet, S-adenosylmethionine; ACC, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxlic acid. to proteins seemed to be promoted by acidic, basic, and hydrophobic side chains neighboring the target cysteine residue (23.Hess D.T. Matsumoto A. Kim S.O. Marshall H.E. Stamler J.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 150-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (1706) Google Scholar).Until now more than 100 proteins were reported as targets for protein S-nitrosylation in animals. In plants there is experimental evidence for only three plant proteins to be regulated by S-nitrosylation. Arabidopsis hemoglobin 1 can scavenge NO through the formation of S-nitrosohemoglobin and in vitro experiments suggested that glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and the K+-channel in guard cells are regulated by NO via S-nitrosylation (26.Perazzolli M. Dominici P. Romero-Puertas M.C. Zago E. Zeier J. Sonoda M. Lamb C. Delledonne M. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 2785-2794Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 27.Sokolovski S. Blatt M.R.

Recently, we identified 63 proteins from Arabidopsis cell cultures and 52 proteins from Arabidopsis leaves representing candidates for protein S-nitrosylation including stress-related, redox-related, signaling/regulating, cytoskeleton, and metabolic proteins (28.Lindermayr C. Saalbach G. Durner J. Plant Physiol. 2005; 137: 921-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). The latter group contains enzymes of the methylmethionine cycle: cobalamin-independent methionine synthase, S-adenosylhomocysteinase and S-methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT) (see Fig. 1). MAT catalyzes the biosynthesis of S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), which is the most important methyl donor in transmethylation reactions and a substrate for the biosynthesis of polyamines and the plant hormone ethylene. Because of this important function of AdoMet it is not surprising that most species studied today have more than one MAT isoform (29.Sanchez-Perez G.F. Bautista J.M. Pajares M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 693-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In mammals, two genes (MAT1A and MAT2A) encode different MAT isoenzymes that show an organ-specific expression pattern. MAT1A is expressed in the liver only, whereas MAT2A is expressed in all other tissues (30.Mato J.M. Alvarez L. Ortiz P. Mingorance J. Duran C. Pajares M.A. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1994; 368: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, the most interesting difference between these two isoenzymes is that MAT1A is reversibly inactivated by NO, whereas MAT2A is not. Responsible for the inactivation is the S-nitrosylation of the cysteine residue 121 of MAT1A, which is located within a flexible loop that can gate access to the active center (19.Perez-Mato I.

Moreover, it has been shown that the inducible NO synthase controls the activity of liver MAT (31.Avila M.A. Mingorance J. Martinez-Chantar M.L. Casado M. Martin-Sanz P. Bosca L. Mato J.M. Hepatology. 1997; 25: 391-396PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, NO regulates the synthesis of AdoMet and as consequence the synthesis of the metabolites AdoMet is necessary for.In this paper, we report the differential inhibition of MAT isoenzymes of Arabidopsis by the NO donor GSNO. We isolated the coding sequences of three MAT isoforms and produced the corresponding enzymes as GST-fusion proteins in Escherichia coli. Activity assays with recombinant GST-MAT fusion proteins pretreated with GSNO demonstrated that the activity of isoenzyme MAT1 is reduced to 30%, whereas the other two isoforms are only weakly affected by this treatment. Site-directed mutagenesis and mass spectrometric analysis showed that S-nitrosylation of the cysteine residue 114 of MAT1 is responsible for the inhibition of the enzymatic activity. Thus, MAT1 represents the first metabolic plant enzyme that is regulated by S-nitrosylation of a redox-sensitive cysteine residue. Furthermore, our results led us to speculate about the involvement of MAT in the regulation of ethylene biosynthesis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESStructural Analysis—Amino acid sequences were aligned and modeled using SWISS-Model (www.expasy.ch). The crystal structure of E. coli methionine adenosyltransferase (Protein Data Bank code 1RG9, chains A and B) was used as template for the prediction of the putative conformations of MAT1, MAT2, and MAT3.Isolation of Coding Sequences of MAT Isoforms—For cloning the cDNAs of the different MAT isoforms the λ phage-based site-specific recombination (Stratagene) was used (38.Landy A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 913-949Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, RNA from Arabidopsis leaves and stems was used for reverse transcription-PCR using PfuTurbo DNA polymerase, gene-specific primers, and the following PCR conditions: 2 min at 94 °C, 35 cycles consisting of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 57 °C for amplification of MAT1 and MAT3 cDNA, and 30 s at 54 °C for amplification of MAT2 cDNA, and 2.5 min at 72 °C, followed by a final extension step of 10 min at 72 °C. The introduction of the DNA recombination sequence (att) at the 5′- and 3′-end of the coding sequence of each isoform was achieved by PCR using the isoform-specific att-primers and the amplified cDNAs as template. The resulting PCR products were introduced into pDONR221 by recombination using BP Clonase enzyme mixture according to the instructions of the manufacturer. After verifying the sequences of the different MAT isoforms by sequencing they were transferred into the expression vector pDEST15 by recombination using LP Clonase enzyme mixture.Expression in E. coli and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—E. coli strain BL21 DE3 pLysS harboring the plasmids pDEST15-MAT1, pDEST15-MAT2, pDEST15-MAT3, or pDEST15-MAT1/C114R were grown in Luria-Bertani medium until A600 ∼0.5 was reached. Production of recombinant GST fusion proteins was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. After incubation for 4 h at 37°C bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation. For protein isolation the cells were resuspended in an appropriate volume of buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT)) and disrupted by sonication. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation (20,000 × g, 20 min, 4°C). The recombinant GST fusion proteins were purified by affinity chromatography using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences). Adsorbed proteins were eluted from the matrix with 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 20 mm glutathione. After adding 20% (v/v) glycerol to the eluates they were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -20 °C until analysis.MAT Activity Assay—Purified enzymes were activated with 10 mm DTT (20 min, 4 °C), and residual DTT was removed using Micro Biospin 6 columns (Bio-Rad). The enzyme activity was assayed as described by (39.Shen B. Li C. Tarczynski M.C. Plant J. 2002; 29: 371-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, 50 μl of purified enzyme (∼15 μg of protein) were added to 150 ml of a reaction mixture containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 30 mm MgSO4, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm ATP, and 5 mm [35S]Met (15 μCi). Control reactions contained all agents except for ATP. Reactions were incubated for 1–2 h at 35 °C and were terminated by placement on ice-water. Fifty microliters of the reaction mixture were then spotted onto chromatography paper P81 (2 cm × 2 cm) in duplicate or triplicate. The papers were air-dried and washed two times with ice-water for 5 min. The washed chromatography papers were transferred to scintillation vials containing 1 ml of 1.5 mm ammonium hydroxide. After 5 min, scintillation liquid was added, and the samples were counted by scintillation spectrometry.Site-directed Mutagenesis—The modification of single nucleotide residues was performed as previously described (40.Lindermayr C. Fliegmann J. Ebel J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2781-2786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, for mutation, a pair of oligonucleotides was synthesized harboring the desired alterations. The size of the primers was adjusted to yield a melting temperature of 68 °C by using the following formula: Tm = 81.5 + 0.41 × GC (%) - 675/number of bases - sequence deviation (%). For amplification, 20 ng of plasmid DNA was used in a total volume of 15 μl, including 1 μm each primer, 200 μm dNTPs, and 1 unit of PfuTurbo DNA polymerase. After denaturation (2 min at 94 °C) 18 cycles were conducted, consisting of 45 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, and 15 min at 72 °C, followed by a final extension step at 72 °C for 10 min. Subsequently, the parental and hemi-parental template DNA was digested with DpnI, and the amplified plasmids were transformed into E. coli DH5α. The mutation was verified by sequencing.Mass Spectrometric Analyses—Purified recombinant MAT1 protein was dissolved in 0.1 m NH4HCO3 at 0.5 μg/μl. Aliquots of 10–20 μg of were treated with 500 ng of chymotrypsin at room temperature for 3 h. The digest was then diluted 1:8 into 50% (v/v) methanol/5% (v/v) formic acid. For analysis by mass spectrometry, this solution was applied to a Q-TOF Ultima™ Global (Micromass, Manchester, UK) by electrospray ionization using the nanospray kit coupled to a 100-μl Hamilton syringe. The mass spectrometer was calibrated using MS/MS fragments of GluFib (Sigma). Full mass scans of 1 s were recorded at a collision energy of 10 V, loss of the NO group was achieved at 20–25 V, and MS/MS fragmentation was achieved at 30 V. A number of scans recorded over time were combined and smoothed (Savitzky-Golay, 3/2).Determination of Ethylene—Seven-day-old Arabidopsis cell cultures were portioned in 10-ml fractions in 25-ml Erlenmeyer flasks under sterile conditions. The following day the cell cultures were treated with water (control) or different concentrations of GSNO and incubated in dark at 26 °C (126 rpm). To measure the ethylene production of the cells the flasks were air-tight and after 30 min 1 ml of gas was collected from the gas phase of the cultures using a syringe. The produced ethylene was measured with a PerkinElmer Autosystem XL gas chromatograph equipped with a Porapak Q column (Supelco) and a flame ionization detector as described previously (41.Tuomainen J. Betz C. Kangasjarvi J. Ernst D. Yin Z.H. Langebartels C. Sandermann H. Plant J. 1997; 12: 1151-1162Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar).RESULTSIn a recent publication (28.Lindermayr C. Saalbach G. Durner J. Plant Physiol. 2005; 137: 921-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar), we identified more than 100 proteins as S-nitrosylation targets, among them MAT, which is responsible for supplying AdoMet, e.g. for ethylene biosynthesis. Interestingly, NO inhibits ethylene production in plants (42.Leshem Y. Haramaty E. J. Plant Physiol. 1996; 148: 258-263Crossref Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 43.Leshem Y.Y. Wills R.B.H. Ku V.V. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 1998; 36: 825-826Crossref Scopus (365) Google Scholar). We treated Arabidopsis cell cultures with different concentrations of the NO donor GSNO and determined their ethylene emission (Fig. 2). With 0.5 mm GSNO we detected a maximal inhibition of the ethylene production of 20% after a 3-h incubation. Longer incubation times reduced the inhibition of ethylene emission to 10% (6 and 24 h). Treatment with 1 mm GSNO decreased ethylene production to 55% after 6 h of treatment, and the production is restored with longer incubation times (24 h).FIGURE 2Ethylene emission of Arabidopsis cell cultures after treatment with GSNO. Arabidopsis cell cultures were treated with 0.5 mm (light gray) and 1 mm GSNO (dark gray). The cell cultures were air-tight and after the indicated times the produced ethylene was collected. After 30 min the amount of produced ethylene was determined as described previously (41.Tuomainen J. Betz C. Kangasjarvi J. Ernst D. Yin Z.H. Langebartels C. Sandermann H. Plant J. 1997; 12: 1151-1162Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)A possible mechanism for NO-dependent decrease of ethylene production could be the S-nitrosylation of MAT. Searching the NCBI nucleotide data base we found four different MAT-encoding sequences in Arabidopsis. The deduced amino acid sequences of the different isoenzymes show high homology among each other (89.3–96.4% amino acid sequence identity) and possess seven highly conserved cysteines (Fig. 3). MAT1 and MAT3 have one additional cysteine at positions 114 and 302, respectively.FIGURE 3Alignment of the amino acid sequences of Arabidopsis MAT isoforms. GenBank™ accession numbers are as follows: MAT1 (NP_849577), MAT2 (AAA32869), MAT3 (AAD31573), MAT4 (AAO11581). Highly conserved cysteine residues are bordered, and Cys-114 of MAT1 is marked with an arrow. Amino acids forming the active site loop acids are highlighted with gray. Dots mark amino acids identical to the sequence of MAT1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To investigate whether the activity of the Arabidopsis MAT isoenzymes is regulated by NO we first had to isolate the coding sequence of the Arabidopsis proteins. Because the localization of the cysteines of MAT2 and MAT4 are identical we concentrated our investigations on the isoforms 1, 2, and 3. The isolation of the cDNAs of these three MAT isoforms was achieved by reverse transcription-PCR using gene-specific oligonucleotides, and the amplified coding sequences were expressed in E. coli as inducible fusion proteins containing N-terminal glutathione S-transferase. After affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose 4B, the three fusion proteins showed the expected relative molecular masses of 68 kDa in SDS-polyacrylamide gels.The effect of NO on the activity of the different MAT isoforms was tested by incubating the purified enzymes with 1 mm GSNO and determining their activities afterward. The activity of MAT1 was reduced to ∼30%, whereas neither the activity of MAT2 nor of MAT3 was significantly affected (Fig. 4A). The activity of the inhibited MAT1 could completely be restored by adding 10 mm DTT. Incubation of MAT1 with different doses of GSNO showed that a concentration of 10 μm already reduced the enzyme activity to 50% (Fig. 4B).FIGURE 4Differential inhibition of Arabidopsis MAT isoforms by GSNO. A, recombinant MAT isoenzymes were produced in E. coli and purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Purified enzymes were incubated in the absence (black) or presence (light gray) of 1 mm GSNO for 20 min at room temperature before enzyme activity was measured. For restoring MAT activity, 10 mm DTT was added to extracts with inhibited enzymes (dark gray). The activity of untreated enzymes was set to 100%. Values are the mean ± S.D. of at least four different measurements. B, dose-dependent inhibition of Arabidopsis MAT1 was analyzed by incubating purified, recombinant MAT1 with different concentrations of GSNO for 20 min at room temperature before measuring the enzyme activity. Values are the mean of at least three different experiments. C, SH-modifying agents DTNB and NEM reduce activity of Arabidopsis MAT isoforms. Recombinant enzymes purified from E. coli were incubated with 250 mm DTNB (light gray) or 500 mm NEM (dark gray) for 20 min at room temperature. Afterward, the activity of the enzymes were measured. Control treatment was done with water (black). The activity of the controls was set to 100%. Values represent means of two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further characterize the mechanism of GSNO-mediated MAT inhibition, we tested the influence of the cysteine residue-modifying agents N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) and 5,5′-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid (DTNB) on the activity of the different MAT isoforms. NEM is a highly reactive agent that covalently and irreversibly alkylates free cysteine thiol groups. DTNB is an oxidizing reagent that acts by formation of a disulfide bond between itself and free cysteine thiol groups resulting in a dithiobenzoate complex with proteins. As shown in Fig. 4C exposure to 250 μm DTNB led to complete inactivation of MAT1, whereas MAT2 and MAT3 activity was reduced to 40 and 35%, respectively. We observed a similar result after treatment with 500 μm NEM. Although MAT1 was totally inhibited, MAT2 and MAT3 showed a residual activity of 40 and 20%, respectively (Fig. 4C).E. coli MAT has been crystallized in a ternary complex with the S-adenosylmethionine and imidotriphosphate (44.Komoto J. Yamada T. Takata Y. Markham G.D. Takusagawa F. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 1821-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Because this enzyme shares 54.4–55.4% identical amino acid residues with the Arabidopsis MAT isoforms, it was possible to use the structure of E. coli MAT as a template to model the hypothetical three-dimensional conformation of the Arabidopsis MAT isoenzymes. Actually, MAT is a tetramer of two asymmetric dimers. Each dimer has two-substrate binding site, which are located between the interface of the monomers and are gated by an flexible loop (34.Takusagawa F. Kamitori S. Markham G.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2586-2596Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 35.Takusagawa F. Kamitori S. Misaki S. Markham G.D. J. Biol.

The structural models gave us insight into the spatial disposition of the cysteine residues of the MAT isoforms to identify cysteine residues representing possible candidates for S-nitrosylation. All of the seven highly conserved cysteine residues are present as free amino acids, and therefore all are possible targets for NO. More interestingly, the additional cysteine residue of MAT1 (Cys-114, Fig. 3) is located directly next to the putative catalytic center as part of the acti"

A recent study also demonstrated that inhibition of the activities of cysteine proteases with a broad inhibitor reduced angiogenesis and growth of pancreatic β-cell islet carcinoma in mice with an SV40 T antigen (Tag) transgene driven by the rat insulin II promoter (RIP1-Tag2) (9Bergers G.

However, many important questions are still unanswered; for example, which cathepsin(s) is the most important and by what mechanisms do these cysteinyl cathepsins affect tumor progression? Earlier studies suggested the importance of cathepsin (Cat) B in tumor angiogenesis and growth (6Yanamandra N. Gumidyala K.V. Waldron K.G. Gujrati M. Olivero W.C. Dinh D.H. Rao J.S. Mohanam S.

Oncogene. 2004; 23: 8486-8496Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). However, additional studies also demonstrated constitutive expression of Cat B in several cell types or tissues (12Hershberg R.M. Framson P.E. Cho D.H. Lee L.Y. Kovats S. Beitz J. Blum J.S. Nepom G.T. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: 204-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 13Vigneswaran N. Wu J. Nagaraj N. Adler-Storthz K. Zacharias W. Int. J. Oncol. 2005; 26: 103-112PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, cathepsins other than Cat B may also be involved in angiogenesis, tumor growth, cell proliferation, and metastasis. We tested this hypothesis in our previous study with Cat S-deficient endothelial cells in vitro. Inhibition of Cat S activity or the absence of Cat S expression reduced microvessel formation in Matrigel (14Shi G.P. Sukhova G.K. Kuzuya M. Ye Q. Du J. Zhang Y. Pan J.H. Lu M.L. Cheng X.W. Iguchi A. Perrey S. Lee A.M. Chapman H.A. Libby P. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 493-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Here we introduced mutant alleles of Cat S or its inhibitor cystatin (Cyst) C into the RIP1-Tag2 transgenic tumor model, in which the angiogenic switch is a key step in islet cell carcinogenesis, to test whether the absence of Cat S or Cyst C expression affected tumor growth and, if so, to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms. Generation of RIP1-Tag2/Cat S-/- and RIP1-Tag2/Cyst C-/- Mice—RIP1-Tag2 transgenic mice (in C57/Bl6 background) (11Joyce J.A. Baruch A. Chehade K. Meyer-Morse N. Giraudo E. Tsai F.Y. Greenbaum D.C.

Cyst C-/- (mixed background) (15Sukhova G.K. Wang B. Libby P. Pan J.H. Zhang Y. Grubb A. Fang K. Chapman H.A. Shi G.P. Circ. Res. 2005; 96: 368-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) mice were also crossbred with RIP1-Tag2 transgenic mice. The resulting RIP1-Tag2/Cyst C+/- mice were used as breeding pairs to generate RIP1-Tag2/Cyst C+/+ and RIP1-Tag2/Cyst C-/- littermates. When mice were 10.5 weeks old, serum was collected, and pancreatic angiogenic islets were harvested, counted, and optimal cutting temperature compound (OCT)-embedded. At 12.5 weeks, mouse serum samples were collected, islet cell carcinomas were harvested, and tumors were measured according to the formula (volume = 0.52 × (width)2 × length in mm3) and embedded in OCT for tissue-section staining or protein extraction into pH 7.2 lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.015 m CaCl2, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) for MMP zymogram, ELISA, and immunoblot analysis or pH 5.5 lysis buffer (1 mm EDTA, 0.05% Triton X-100, 20 mm sodium acetate) for cysteine protease active-site labeling. Immunohistochemistry—Serial cryostat sections (6 μm) of pancreatic islet cell carcinoma were fixed in acetone (-20 °C, 10 min) and stained by the avidin-biotin-peroxidase method (ABC kit, Vector Laboratories). After peroxidase activity was limited with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide and nonspecific binding of primary antibody with 5% species-appropriate normal serum, sections were incubated with primary antibodies diluted in PBS overnight at 4 °C. Incubation with secondary antibodies for 30 min was followed by incubation with the avidin-biotin complex conjugated with horseradish peroxidase for another 30 min. The reaction was visualized with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (Vector Laboratories) followed by counterstaining with Gill’s hematoxylin solution (Fisher) or methyl green (DAKO). The antibodies used were rat antimouse CD31 (1:800; Pharmingen), rabbit anti-human Ki67 (1:1000; Novacastra Laboratories, UK), and rabbit anti-mouse canstatin, tumstatin, and arresten (1:500) (16Kamphaus G.D.

Microvessel density of each tumor was determined by measuring the pixel area of CD31-positive staining in five random areas using the image analysis software Image-Pro Plus as described previously (15Sukhova G.K.

Griffioen A.W. Microvasc. Res. 2000; 59: 368-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). A total of 16-20 tumors per group were selected, and data were presented as percentage of CD31-positive areas (mean ± S.E.), CD31-positive area versus image area (×100). The percentage of Ki67-positive cells was determined by scanning rabbit anti-human Ki67 antibody-stained slides and choosing five random areas per tumor to count both Ki67-positive and total cell numbers, with data presented as mean ± S.E. of the Ki67-positive cell percentage. Percentages of positive areas of canstatin, arresten, and tumstatin were determined by capturing five random areas of each slide (×100), and positive staining on each image was quantified using the same image analysis software Image-Pro Plus as we described previously (15Sukhova G.K. Wang B. Libby P. Pan J.H. Zhang Y. Grubb A. Fang K. Chapman H.A. Shi G.P. Circ. Res. 2005; 96: 368-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), and data were presented as mean ± S.E. Cysteine Protease Active-site Labeling and MMP Zymography—Tumor tissue cysteine protease and MMP activities were determined by pulverizing tumor tissues and extracting into pH 5.5 buffer (cysteine proteases) or pH 7.2 buffer (MMPs). Protein concentrations were determined with the Dc protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Cysteine protease activities were measured by labeling equal amounts of protein (100 μg) of each sample with 125I-JPM at 37 °C for 1 h as described previously (15Sukhova G.K. Wang B. Libby P. Pan J.H. Zhang Y. Grubb A. Fang K. Chapman H.A. Shi G.P. Circ. Res. 2005; 96: 368-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) followed by separation on 14% SDS-PAGE. MMP activities were assessed by separating 2 μg of protein from each sample on 10% SDS-PAGE containing 1 mg/ml gelatin and then visualizing active MMP-9 and MMP-2 signals by a protocol described previously (20Fang K.C. Raymond W.W. Lazarus S.C. Caughey G.H. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 97: 1589-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Blood Glucose Measurement—Commercial blood glucose strips were purchased from Home Diagnosis Inc. (Ft. Lauderdale, FL). One drop of blood was applied to the strip, and the glucose was measured directly on the supplied blood glucose meter. ELISA—VEGF (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), bFGF (R & D Systems), IGF-1 (Immunodiagnostic Systems, UK), TGF-β1 (Biosources, Camarillo, CA), and endostatin (Cytimmune Sciences, Rockville, MD) in tumor tissue lysates and serum were determined with commercially available ELISA kits according to the manufacturers’ protocols. In brief, tissue lysates, sera, and known concentrations of recombinant growth factors, as internal standards, were added to the wells of 96-well microtiter plates, which were precoated with capturing antibodies to the specific growth factor being assessed. After a 2-h incubation at room temperature, the plate was washed four times, and a biotinylated detecting antibody to the growth factor was added and incubated for another hour followed by 30 min of incubation with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate. The plate was then washed four times, and a premixed TMB substrate solution was added. The plate was developed at room temperature in the dark for 30 min before the reaction was stopped. The absorbance of each well was measured at 450 nm with an ELISA reader. Immunoblot Analysis—Equal amounts of tumor extracts (40 μg) or equal volumes of serum (2 μl) from each mouse were separated on 8 (to detect laminin-5 γ2 chains) or 14% (to detect canstatin) SDS-PAGE and blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Primary antibodies included rabbit anti-mouse canstatin (1:1000) (16Kamphaus G.D. Colorado P.C. Panka D.J. Hopfer H. Ramchandran R. Torre A. Maeshima Y. Mier J.W. Sukhatme V.P. Kalluri R. J. Biol.

Brakebusch C. Yamada Y. Fassler R. Timpl R. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 751-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). A β-actin immunoblot was performed as a loading control for tumor extract proteins (1:5000; Sigma). Canstatin and Arresten Degradation by Recombinant Cat S—One microgram of purified recombinant murine canstatin (16Kamphaus G.D. Colorado P.C. Panka D.J. Hopfer H. Ramchandran R. Torre A. Maeshima Y.

Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2520-2526PubMed Google Scholar) was incubated with various amounts of recombinant human Cat S (0, 0.1, 1, and 10 nm) in a pH 5.5 reaction buffer containing 50 mm sodium acetate, 0.1% Triton, and 6 mm dithiothreitol for 1 h at 37°C. Reaction mixtures were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE followed with immunoblot detection with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against murine canstatin and arresten (1:1000). Laminin-5 Degradation by Recombinant Human Cat S—Human epidermoid carcinoma A431 cells were cultured in 150-mm cell culture dishes in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with 10% fetal calf serum until confluent. Cells were then lysed and washed in 1× PBS containing 0.5% Triton four times for 10 min at 4 °C as described to remove intracellular proteins (22Weitzman J.B. Pasqualini R. Takada Y. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8651-8657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell skeletons were prepared by washing cells with 2 m urea in 1 m NaCl for 10 min at 4 °C followed by another wash with 1× PBS. Cell skeleton preparations were collected into 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes and then incubated with or without recombinant human Cat S at different concentrations (60, 3, 0.15, and 0.0075 nm) in a pH 5.5 reaction buffer for 1 h at 37 °C. Reaction mixtures were separated directly on 8% SDS-PAGE for immunoblot analysis with human laminin-5 monoclonal antibody 19562 (1:1000; Chemicon). Laminin-5 degradation by Cat S was further examined by culturing the A431 cells on 6-well plates. After confluent cells were lysed and washed with 1× PBS, 0.5% Triton, 2 mm urea, 1 m NaCl, and 1× PBS, primary cultured mouse endothelial cells (1 × 106/well) from Cat S-/- and wild-type mice were seeded onto each well followed by an overnight incubation. Culture media and cell lysates, which contain the whole endothelial cells and residual A431 matrix protein, were collected. Equal amounts of lysate (40 μg/well) and culture media (concentrates from 100 μl of culture media) were separated on 8% SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot staining with human laminin-5 monoclonal antibodies (1:1000). Purification of Cat S-generated Laminin-5 γ2 Fragments and Aortic Ring Assay—A431 cell skeleton protein preparations were digested with recombinant Cat S (0.5, 5, and 30 nm) at 37 °C for 1 h. Reactions were terminated with 10 nm Cat S-selective inhibitor N-morpholinurealeucine-homophenylalanine-vinylsulfone-phenyl (23Shi G.P. Bryant R.A. Riese R. Verhelst S. Driessen C. Li Z. Bromme D. Ploegh H.L. Chapman H.A. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1177-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) and neutralized with 0.5 m Tris·HCl, pH 10.2. After removal of nondigested precipitates, supernatant was incubated with AminoLink® Plus coupling gel (Pierce) coupled with human laminin-5 monoclonal antibody. After overnight incubation at 4 °C, the affinity gel was washed and eluted into fractions. The peptide purity in each fraction was examined on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel followed by silver staining, and peptide specificity was verified with an immunoblot analysis using human laminin-5 monoclonal antibody (21Sasaki T. Gohring W. Mann K. Brakebusch C. Yamada Y. Fassler R. Timpl R. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 751-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Protein concentration of each purified peptide was determined with the Bio-Rad Dc protein assay kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The bioactivity of purified laminin-5 γ2 fragments was examined with an aortic ring assay as described previously (24Kato T. Kure T. Chang J.H. Gabison E.E. Itoh T. Itohara S. Azar D.T. FEBS Lett. 2001; 508: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 96-well plate was covered with 50 μl of Matrigel (BD Biosciences). A 1-mm-long mouse aortic ring was laid on the top of the Matrigel and covered with another 100 μl of Matrigel. After 30 min of solidification, 100 μl of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium without fetal calf serum, with or without purified laminin-5 γ2 fragments, was added to each well to a final concentration of 10 ng/ml. The combination of bFGF (10 ng/ml) and interferon-γ (500 units/ml) was used as a positive control (24Kato T. Kure T. Chang J.H. Gabison E.E. Itoh T. Itohara S. Azar D.T. FEBS Lett. 2001; 508: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). After 10 days of culture, the gels were photographed, and the endothelial outgrowth was analyzed by manually circulating and computing square pixels and quantified by Image-Pro Plus software. Data were presented as mean area ± S.E. (mm2). p values <0.05 were considered significant (Mann-Whitney test). Deficiency of Cat S and Its Inhibitor Cyst C in Mice Altered Angiogenesis, Tumor Growth, and Life Span—RIP1-Tag2 transgenic mice (9Bergers G. Brekken R. McMahon G. Vu T.H. Itoh T. Tamaki K. Tanzawa K. Thorpe P. Itohara S. Werb Z. Hanahan D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (2257) Google Scholar) develop pancreatic islet cell carcinoma over time in stages. At the age of 12-14 weeks, well established solid tumors can be detected. Beginning at 10.5 weeks of age, nascent solid tumors form by progressing from a dysplastic stage called angiogenic islets, only a small fraction of which ultimately progress into mature carcinomas. This model provides a useful system for assessing the contribution of proteases and protease inhibitors to angiogenesis and tumor growth. To examine whether cysteine protease Cat S participates in these pathologic events, we generated Cat S-deficient (Cat S-/-) RIP1-Tag2 mice (in C57/BL6 background). Relative to RIP1-Tag2/Cat S+/+ mice (wild type for Cat S), RIP1-Tag2/Cat S-/- mice developed much smaller tumors at 12.5 weeks of age (Fig. 1A) and significantly fewer angiogenic islets at age 10.5 weeks (Fig. 1B). Immunostaining for endothelial cells (CD31) demonstrated reduced microvessel density in tumors from RIP1-Tag2/Cat S-/- mice (Fig. 1C). Cyst C is an endogenous inhibitor of cysteine proteases, with highest inhibitory competency for Cat S (25Hall A. Ekiel I. Mason R.W. Kasprzykowski F. Grubb A. Abrahamson M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4071-4079Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A previous study reported that the absence of Cyst C increased the activities of cysteinyl cathepsins in tissues under inflammatory conditions (15Sukhova G.K. Wang B. Libby P. Pan J.H. Zhang Y. Grubb A. Fang K. Chapman H.A. Shi G.P. Circ. Res. 2005; 96: 368-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). To examine the impact of Cyst C and to assess further the importance of Cat S and other cysteine cathepsins in angiogenesis and tumor growth (given that six cysteine cathepsins are up-regulated in this model; see Ref. 11Joyce J.A. Baruch A. Chehade K. Meyer-Morse N. Giraudo E. Tsai F.Y. Greenbaum D.C. Hager J.H. Bogyo M. Hanahan D. Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 443-453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar), we generated Cyst C-deficient (Cyst C-/-) RIP1-Tag2 mice (C57/BL6/129S mixed background). Relative to their RIP1-Tag2/Cyst C+/+ littermates, RIP1-Tag2/Cyst C-/- mice developed much larger islet cell carcinomas at age 12.5 weeks (Fig. 1D) and significantly more angiogenic islets at age 10.5 weeks (Fig. 1E). Consistently, the density of CD31-positive microvessels from the tumors was much higher in the RIP1-Tag2/Cyst C-/- mice (Fig. 1F). To examine whether the lack of Cat S or Cyst C in RIP1-Tag2 mice affected other cathepsins or even MMPs activity that might contribute to the phenotypes in Fig. 1, we labeled tumor extracts from the RIP1-Tag2/Cat S-/- and RIP1-Tag2/Cyst C-/- mice and their corresponding wild-type controls by 125I-JPM, which labels only active cysteine proteases (23Shi G.P. Bryant R.A. Riese R. Verhelst S. Driessen C. Li Z. Bromme D. Ploegh H.L. Chapman H.A. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1177-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), and we then performed a gelatin zymogram assay to assess the relative MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity in these tissues. We detected no changes in any cathepsins other than a difference in Cat S expression between RIP1-Tag2/Cat S+/+ and RIP1-Tag2/Cat S-/- mice (Fig. 2A). In contrast, we detected more 125I-JPM-labeled cathepsin signals, especially Cat S and Cat L, in tumor extracts from RIP1-Tag2/Cyst C-/- mice than in those from RIP1-Tag2/Cyst C+/+ mice (Fig. 2A), although we observed no differences in MMP activity in the presence or absence of Cat S or Cyst C (data not shown). Therefore, altered Cat S activity is evidently one of the factors affecting altered tumor growth and angiogenesis in RIP1-Tag2/Cat S-/- and RIP1-Tag2/Cyst C-/- mice (Fig. 1). Because of the absence of Cat S-reduced tumor growth, we asked whether such alteration might prolong the life span of tumor-bearing mice. RIP1-Tag2 mice receiving a chow diet are known to die of hypoglycemia any time after 12 weeks of age (9Bergers G. Brekken R. McMahon G. Vu T.H. Itoh T. Tamaki K. Tanzawa K. Thorpe P. Itohara S. Werb Z. Hanahan D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (2257) Google Scholar). We monitored 12 mice from each group (RIP1-Tag2/Cat S+/+ and RIP1-Tag2/Cat S-/-) and noted that Cat S deficiency prolonged the life span of RIP1-Tag2 mice by an average of 2 weeks (13.3 ± 0.3 versus 15.2 ± 0.6, p < 0.05) (Mann-Whitney test). Consistent with earlier findings (9Bergers G. Brekken R. McMahon G. Vu T.H. Itoh T. Tamaki K. Tanzawa K. Thorpe P. Itohara S. Werb Z. Hanahan D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (2257) Google Scholar), mice bearing the RIP1-Tag2 transgene demonstrated significantly lower serum glucose levels than their counterparts without the transgene (Fig. 2C). Among all RIP1-Tag2 mice tested, RIP1-Tag2/Cat S-/- mice showed higher serum glucose levels than RIP1-Tag2/Cat S+/+ mice (Fig. 2C), which may also contribute to the prolonged life span observed in RIP1-Tag2/Cat S-/- mice. Consistent with insignificant changes in serum glucose levels between RIP1-Tag2/Cyst C+/+ and RIP1-Tag2/Cyst C-/- mice, we detected no significant differences in life span (15.7 ± 0.8 versus 16.7 ± 0.7, p = 0.3), although both groups lived significantly longer than RIP1-Tag2/Cat S+/+ mice did, likely because of the genetic background differences. Cat S Activity on Tumor Cell Proliferation, Pro-angiogenic Growth Factors, and Anti-angiogenic Endostatin—Inhibition of cysteinyl cathepsins by JPM-ethyl ester has been found to impair tumor cell proliferation in the RIP1-Tag2 islet cell carcinoma model (11Joyce J.A.

Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 443-453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). By using this same tumor model with the absence of Cat S expression, we observed a similar phenotype. Tumor cell proliferation was reduced in RIP1-Tag2/Cat S-/- tumors, with significant reduction of the percentage of Ki67-positive cells (Fig. 3, A and B). In contrast, the percentage of Ki67-positive cells was increased in RIP1-Tag2/Cyst C-/- tumors, most likely because of enhanced cysteinyl cathepsin activity and loss of Cyst C activity in antagonizing cell proliferation (26Sokol J.P. Schiemann W.P. Mol. Cancer Res. 2004; 2: 183-195PubMed Google Scholar, 27Sokol J.P. Neil J.R. Schiemann B.J. Schiemann W.P. Breast Cancer Res. 2005; 7: R844-R853Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3, A and B). Thus, Cat S activity is functionally involved in regulating tumor cell proliferation in a nonredundant fashion, given that five other cysteine cathepsins are expressed (11Joyce J.A. Baruch A. Chehade K. Meyer-Morse N. Giraudo E. Tsai F.Y. Greenbaum D.C. Hager J.H. Bogyo M. Hanahan D. Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 443-453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that Cat S deficiency impairs the neoplastic phenotype, we cannot exclude the possibility that these other cathepsins are also contributing to tumor cell proliferation. Cellular growth factors play essential roles in regulating cell migration, proliferation, protease expression, and matrix remodeling, angiogenesis, tumor growth, and metastasis. Multiple studies have demonstrated that proteases participate in the release of growth factors from the extracellular matrix and basement membranes, either by converting them from their latent forms or degrading their associated inhibitors (9Bergers G.

We therefore asked whether a deficiency of Cat S or an increase in the expression of cysteinyl cathepsins because of the lack of Cyst C had any impact on levels of angiogenesis-associated growth factors. Such effects might explain the phenotypes shown in Figs. 1 and 3. We measured circulating VEGF, bFGF, IGF-I, and TGF-β1 in mo"
https://openalex.org/W2014500807,"Mutant α1-antitrypsin Z (α1-ATZ) protein, which has a tendency to form aggregated polymers as it accumulates within the endoplasmic reticulum of the liver cells, is associated with the development of chronic liver injury and hepatocellular carcinoma in hereditary α1-antitrypsin (α1-AT) deficiency. Previous studies have suggested that efficient intracellular degradation of α1-ATZ is correlated with protection from liver disease in α1-AT deficiency and that the ubiquitin-proteasome system accounts for a major route, but not the sole route, of α1-ATZ disposal. Yet another intracellular degradation system, autophagy, has also been implicated in the pathophysiology of α1-AT deficiency. To provide genetic evidence for autophagy-mediated disposal of α1-ATZ, here we used cell lines deleted for the Atg5 gene that is necessary for initiation of autophagy. In the absence of autophagy, the degradation of α1-ATZ was retarded, and the characteristic cellular inclusions of α1-ATZ accumulated. In wild-type cells, colocalization of the autophagosomal membrane marker GFP-LC3 and α1-ATZ was observed, and this colocalization was enhanced when clearance of autophagosomes was prevented by inhibiting fusion between autophagosome and lysosome. By using a transgenic mouse with liver-specific inducible expression of α1-ATZ mated to the GFP-LC3 mouse, we also found that expression of α1-ATZ in the liver in vivo is sufficient to induce autophagy. These data provide definitive evidence that autophagy can participate in the quality control/degradative pathway for α1-ATZ and suggest that autophagic degradation plays a fundamental role in preventing toxic accumulation of α1-ATZ. Mutant α1-antitrypsin Z (α1-ATZ) protein, which has a tendency to form aggregated polymers as it accumulates within the endoplasmic reticulum of the liver cells, is associated with the development of chronic liver injury and hepatocellular carcinoma in hereditary α1-antitrypsin (α1-AT) deficiency.

It is a prototypic member of serine protease inhibitor (serpin) superfamily proteins and the most abundant of the circulating serpins. The principal role of α1-AT in serum is to protect lung tissues from destructive proteases (elastase, cathepsin G, and proteinase 3) released by neutrophils during inflammation. Some genetic alterations in α1-AT are responsible for defective secretion and thus cause serum α1-AT deficiency (1.Teckman J.H. Qu D. Perlmutter D.H. Hepatology. 1996; 24: 1504-1516PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Lomas D.A. Mahadeva R. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 1585-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 3.Perlmutter D.H. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 1579-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The most common causal mutation found in Caucasian populations is the replacement of Glu-342 by Lys that characterizes the Z mutant of α1-AT (α1-ATZ). This substitution is sufficient to cause an abnormality in folding early in the secretory pathway with retention of the mutant α1-ATZ molecule in the ER of liver cells. Homozygotes for the α1-ATZ mutation (PIZZ) are characterized by serum levels of α1-AT that are ∼10–15% of those in the general population and are susceptible to two major target organ injuries. Destructive lung disease/emphysema in adults is due to a loss-of-function mechanism. Chronic liver disease often first discovered in childhood, but also affecting adults, is due to a gain-of-toxic-function mechanism in which liver cell injury results from the hepatotoxic effects of retained α1-ATZ. However, only 8–10% of homozygotes develop clinically significant liver disease. This observation has led to the concept that mechanisms by which cells respond to the ER retention of mutant α1-ATZ play a role in determining which of these homozygotes develop liver disease and which are protected from it. Because previous studies have shown that a reduction in α1-ATZ disposal activity correlates with the presence of liver disease among deficient individuals (4.Wu Y. Whitman I. Molmenti E. Moore K. Hippenmeyer P. Perlmutter D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9014-9018Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), the mechanisms by which α1-ATZ is degraded are thought to be particularly important in determining the liver disease phenotype of patients with α1-AT deficiency.A number of studies have addressed the determinants of the cellular fate of α1-ATZ, including retention in the ER and disposal by the quality control/degradative pathways of the ER.

Recent studies of the ER-associated degradation system revealed that immature or misfolded glycoproteins are captured by ER chaperone proteins calnexin/calreticulin via the terminal glucose residue on asparagine-linked oligosaccharide side chains, which is reciprocally added or trimmed by UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase or glucosidase II, respectively, according to the folding status of the glycoprotein (6.Yoshida Y.

Indeed, a stoichiometric interaction was observed between α1-ATZ and calnexin (4.Wu Y. Whitman I. Molmenti E. Moore K. Hippenmeyer P. Perlmutter D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Terminally misfolded proteins are translocated from ER lumen to the cytoplasm and consequently degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system putatively deployed at the cytoplasmic face of ER.Detailed studies of proteasome-mediated α1-ATZ disposal, including cell-free assays using ER-derived microsomes, have suggested the existence of one disposal pathway in which the α1-ATZ-calnexin complex is ubiquitinated on calnexin and subsequently degraded (8.Qu D.

It is conceivable that the asparagine-linked Glc1Man8GlcNAc2 on α1-ATZ determines the proteasomal degradation pathway via its physical interaction with calnexin and that diversion to other degradation pathways is brought about by further mannose trimming of the oligosaccharide chain during ER retention (11.Cabral C.M. Choudhury P. Liu Y. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25015-25022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). An unknown protease activity sensitive to tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors has also been reported as a potential mechanism for nonproteasomal intramicrosomal degradation of α1-ATZ (11.Cabral C.M.

Autophagy is characterized by bulk sequestration of cytoplasmic constituents within a double-membrane-bound vesicle, called an autophagosome, and their subsequent degradation upon fusion of this vesicle with lysosome. This process accounts for a major portion of the cellular turnover of long lived proteins and organelles such as ER and mitochondria. In addition to constitutive bulk turnover at steady state, autophagic sequestration is induced by specific physiological perturbations, such as nutrient deprivation. Several lines of evidence have implicated autophagy as a physiological response to cope with accumulation of α1-ATZ in the ER in vivo (19.Teckman J.H. Perlmutter D.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: G961-G974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Teckman J.H. An J.K. Loethen S. Perlmutter D.H. Am. J.

Physiol. 2004; 286: G851-G862Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The liver lesion in PIZZ patients as well as in the PiZ mouse model of α1-AT deficiency is accompanied by a marked autophagic response as determined by ultrastructural studies. When cells engineered to express α1-ATZ were treated with 3-methyladenine, an inhibitor of autophagy, the degradation of α1-ATZ was attenuated (19.Teckman J.H. Perlmutter D.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: G961-G974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Traditional methods for monitoring autophagy by means of ultrastructural criteria or the use of chemical inhibitors can be criticized because it is sometimes difficult to discriminate autophagic vacuoles from other organelles especially in degenerating cells, and because 3-methyladenine, a relatively nonspecific inhibitor of autophagy, could potentially suppress degradation pathways other than autophagy (14.Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Hatano M. Kobayashi Y. Kabeya Y. Suzuki K. Tokuhisa T. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 657-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar). Here we tried to provide molecular evidence for autophagy-mediated disposal of α1-ATZ by two approaches. First, we used cell lines deleted for the Atg5 gene, a target molecule for the ubiquitin-like Atg12 conjugation that is necessary for the initial steps of autophagic sequestration (12.Mizushima N. Noda T. Yoshimori T. Tanaka Y. Ishii T. George M.D. Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi M. Ohsumi Y. Nature. 1998; 395: 395-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar). Second, we used GFP-LC3, a defined marker for autophagosome membrane (13.Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T. Kominami E. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5720-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (5363) Google Scholar, 22.Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Matsui M. Yoshimori T. Ohsumi Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1101-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (1892) Google Scholar), for colocalization studies in cell lines and in the liver of novel mouse models of α1-AT deficiency.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESExpression Plasmids, Antibodies, and Reagents—The cDNAs corresponding to α1-ATZ, Atg5, Atg5K130R, and EYFP were subcloned into pCE-neo plasmid. This plasmid is a modified version of pCI-neo (Promega) in which the promoter region was replaced with a fragment containing the cytomegalovirus enhancer and elongation factor promoter of pCE-FL plasmid (a kind gift from Dr. Sumio Sugano). Proteasome sensor vector pcDEF-Ub-G76V-EGFP (23.Dantuma N.P. Lindsten K. Glas R. Jellne M. Masucci M.G. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 538-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. Shigeo Murata (Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science). The coding sequence for hemagglutinin-tagged canine Rab7 T22N was inserted into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The following antibodies were used: rabbit polyclonal anti-rat LC3 (13.Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T. Kominami E. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5720-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (5363) Google Scholar); anti-human Atg5 (14.Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Hatano M. Kobayashi Y. Kabeya Y. Suzuki K. Tokuhisa T. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 657-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar); anti-α1-AT (DAKO); anti-GFP (Invitrogen); goat polyclonal anti-α1-AT (Research Diagnostics, Inc.); mouse monoclonal anti-α-tubulin (clone B5-1-2; Sigma); and anti-KDEL (clone 10C3; Stressgen SPA-827). Lactacystin (Peptide Institute, Inc.) was prepared as 1 mm stock in distilled water; and MG115, MG132, and epoxomicin (Peptide Institute, Inc.) were prepared as 10 mm stock in Me2SO. Bafilomycin A1 was prepared as 250 μm stock in Me2SO.Cell Culture and Transfection—Wild-type and Atg5-/- ES cells were described previously (14.Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Hatano M. Kobayashi Y. Kabeya Y. Suzuki K. Tokuhisa T. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 657-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar). Atg5-/- mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells were established (24.Kuma A. Hatano M. Matsui M. Yamamoto A. Nakaya H. Yoshimori T. Ohsumi Y. Tokuhisa T. Mizushima N. Nature. 2004; 432: 1032-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (2362) Google Scholar) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and antibiotics in 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Wild-type and Atg5-/- MEF cells were engineered for stable expression of α1-ATZ, Ub-G76V-EGFP, and GFP-LC3, exactly as described previously (25.Lin L. Schmidt B. Teckman J. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33893-33898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Transient transfection was carried out using Lipofectamine2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol.Pulse-Chase Experiments—Cell lines engineered for expression of α1-ATZ either by transient or stable transfection were subjected to pulse-chase studies. The transiently transfected cell lines were studied 24 h after transfection. Separate monolayers were incubated in serum- and methionine/cysteine-free medium for 1 h at 37 °C followed by pulse labeling with 150 μCi/ml of 35S-labeled EasyTag Express protein labeling mix (NEG-772; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 2 h at 37°C. Cells were then rinsed with chase medium and chased for several different time periods. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1% Triton X-100, 3 mg/ml BSA, 1 mm PMSF, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-α1-AT polyclonal antibody and protein G-Sepharose 4FF (Amersham Biosciences), followed by analysis with SDS-PAGE (10% gel) and autoradiography using LAS-3000 bioimage analyzer (Fuji Film).Western Blotting—Cells were collected, rinsed with PBS, and lysed in PBS containing 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) on ice for 30 min. Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble fractions were obtained by centrifuging cell lysates at 15,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Alternatively, cells were rinsed with PBS and directly lysed in SDS sample buffer. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk in 0.1% Tween 20/Tris-buffered saline and then incubated with primary antibodies. Immunoreactive bands were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (The Jackson Laboratories) and luminol solution (1.25 mm luminol, 65 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.2 mm coumaric acid, 0.01% H2O2).Endoglycosidase-H Digestion—Cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation using goat anti-α1-AT polyclonal antibody and protein G-Sepharose 4FF (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitates were boiled in 1% SDS, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, and supernatants were added to the reaction containing 50 mm sodium citrate pH 5.0, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μm pepstatin A, and 0.25 units/ml endoglycosidase-H (Seikagaku Kogyo, Inc.). The reaction was carried out at 37 °C for 16 h.Immunofluorescence Microscopy and Flow Cytometry—For immunofluorescence microscopy, cells cultured on coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS, and blocked with 3% BSA/PBS. Primary antibodies were diluted 1:100, and secondary antibodies were diluted 1:200 in 1% BSA, 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS. Coverslips were successively incubated with primary antibodies, Alexa-conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen), and 1 μg/ml Hoechst 33342/PBS (Sigma) with intervening washes with PBS. Samples were examined by using Olympus FV1000 confocal microscopy. For flow cytometry, cells were collected, rinsed with PBS, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS. Cells in suspension were stained using anti-α1-AT polyclonal antibody and Alexa 488-conjugated secondary antibody as in immunofluorescence microscopy samples and analyzed by BD FACScan.Mice—GFP-LC3 transgenic mice were described previously (22.Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Matsui M. Yoshimori T. Ohsumi Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1101-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (1892) Google Scholar). Z mice, in which expression of human α1-ATZ is induced only in liver parenchymal cells upon removal of doxycycline, were produced by using the Tet-Off gene expression system and TALap 2 mice (26.Hidvegi T. Schmidt B.Z. Hale P. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39002-39015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). These mice were crossed to produce Z × GFP-LC3 mice. PiZ mice with constitutive expression of α1-ATZ (27.Rudnick D.A. Liao Y. An J.K. Muglia L.J. Perlmutter D.H. Teckman J.H. Hepatology. 2004; 39: 1048-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) were also crossed to produce PiZ × GFP-LC3 mice. Liver sections were viewed by confocal microscopy. Quantitative morphometry was carried out by counting green vacuoles in 10 cells with many red globules and 10 cells with few or no red globules in three random areas of the liver each from two different liver sections. The results were analyzed using the MetaMorph software program.RESULTSThe Degradation Rate of α1-ATZ Is Attenuated in Atg5-/- Cells—A previous study demonstrated that disruption of the Atg5 gene in an ES cell line resulted in complete abrogation of autophagy, as confirmed by both morphological and biochemical analyses (14.Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Hatano M. Kobayashi Y. Kabeya Y. Suzuki K. Tokuhisa T. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 657-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar). To investigate whether α1-ATZ is degraded via the autophagic pathway, we first carried out pulse-chase analysis in wild-type and Atg5-/- ES cells transiently transfected with the α1-ATZ expression plasmid. Twenty four hours after transfection, cells were metabolically radiolabeled for 2 h with [35S]methionine/cysteine and chased for 0, 4, 6, and 8 h. Cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-α1-AT antibody, and immunoprecipitated samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. A semi-logarithmic plot of α1-ATZ-specific signals against time indicated that there was more than a 2-fold decrease in the degradation rate of α1-ATZ in Atg5-/- cells in comparison with that in wild-type cells (Fig. 1A). Cell culture fluid from these cells was also subjected to immunoprecipitation and autoradiography at the same time, but secreted α1-ATZ was barely detectable in either wild-type or Atg5-/- cells (data not shown), indicating that secretion is not the cause for more rapid disappearance of α1-ATZ in wild-type cells. The intracellular half-life of α1-ATZ was calculated as 122 min (r2 = 0.99) and 274 min (r2 = 0.97) in wild-type and Atg5-/- cells, respectively. The value in wild-type ES cells is well within the range of values that have been described previously in transfected fibroblasts and hepatoma cell lines (8.Qu D. Teckman J.H. Omura S. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22791-22795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 10.Teckman J.H. Burrows J. Hidvegi T. Schmidt B. Hale P.D. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44865-44872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Next, we examined the fate of α1-ATZ by pulse-chase experiments in wild-type and Atg5-/- MEF cells engineered for stable expression of α1-ATZ (Fig. 1B). The results show that there is a delay in the disappearance of α1-ATZ in the Atg5-/- cells compared with the wild-type MEFs. The difference in degradation of 52-kDa precursor α1-ATZ in the presence and absence of autophagic activity in stable transfected MEFs was almost identical to that in transiently transfected ES cells. A trace amount of mature 55-kDa α1-ATZ was secreted into extracellular fluid. Most interestingly, the abrogation of autophagy was associated with a slight increase in the secretion of α1-ATZ in these cell lines, the significance of which is not yet known.To compare the relative contribution of autophagy and the proteasomal pathway in α1-ATZ degradation in these cells, we performed pulse-chase analysis in the presence of various proteasome inhibitors. Twenty four hours after transient transfection with the α1-ATZ expression plasmid, cells were preincubated with Met/Cys-free medium for 1 h, metabolically labeled for 2 h, and chased for 4 h in the presence of proteasome inhibitors MG115 (20 μm), epoxomicin (10 μm), lactacystin (10 or 30 μm), or vehicle control. The results show that degradation of α1-ATZ was inhibited by all of the proteasome inhibitors in the wild-type cells but not in the Atg5-/- cells. The α1-ATZ degradation rate in wild-type cells treated with proteasome inhibitor was almost same as that in Atg5-/- cells treated with vehicle control (Fig. 1C), indicating that the inhibitory effects of autophagy and the proteasomal pathway were nearly equivalent in these experiments. To exclude the possibility that delayed α1-ATZ degradation in Atg5-/- cells is secondary to proteasome inhibition in these cells, we analyzed proteasome activity by using Ub-G76V-EGFP, a model substrate for the ubiquitin-fusion degradation pathway (23.Dantuma N.P. Lindsten K. Glas R. Jellne M. Masucci M.G. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 538-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Wild-type and Atg5-/- MEF cell lines were engineered for stable expression of Ub-G76V-EGFP and then the cell lines were subjected to flow cytometric analysis for the fluorescent signal. The results showed that there were no differences between the two cell lines in the absence or presence of MG132. Furthermore, transient transfection of the α1-ATZ expression plasmid had no effect on the levels of the proteasomal substrate (Fig. 1D). There was also no difference in the level of polyubiquitinated proteins in the two cell lines as determined by Western blot analysis for ubiquitin (data not shown). These data indicate that expression of α1-ATZ does not inhibit proteasomal activity and furthermore that inhibition of proteasomal activity cannot be an explanation for the delayed degradation in the Atg5-deficient background. Thus, the results of Fig. 1 provide definitive evidence that autophagy can contribute to degradation of α1-ATZ.α1-ATZ Accumulation in Atg5-/- Cells Is Augmented Over Time—Next, we examined steady-state levels of α1-ATZ in wild-type and Atg5-/- cells (Fig. 2A). The results show a significant increase in levels of α1-ATZ in the Atg5-/- cells. α1-ATZ degradation in Atg5-/- cells was restored by cotransfection of wild-type Atg5 but not mutant Atg5K130R (14.Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Hatano M. Kobayashi Y. Kabeya Y. Suzuki K. Tokuhisa T. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 657-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar), indicating that α1-ATZ disposal requires functional Atg5 that is covalently modified by Atg12 to form autophagosomes and to promote the conversion of LC3-I to faster migrating LC3-II (13.Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T. Kominami E. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5720-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (5363) Google Scholar, 16.Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Yamamoto A.

https://openalex.org/W2161458381,"AMPA receptors mediate the majority of the fast excitatory transmission in the central nervous system. Much evidence suggests that the fast trafficking of AMPA receptors into and out of the postsynaptic membrane underlies changes in synaptic strength thought to be necessary for higher cognitive functions such as learning and memory. Despite the abundance of research conducted in this area, a direct, real-time functional assay that measures the trafficking of native AMPA receptors has been lacking. Toward this aim, we use a photoreactive, irreversible antagonist of AMPA receptors, ANQX, to rapidly silence surface AMPA receptors and investigate directly the trafficking of native AMPA receptors in real time. We find that the most dynamic movement of AMPA receptors occurs by lateral movement across the surface of neurons. Fast cycling of surface AMPA receptors with receptors from internal stores does occur but exclusively at extrasynaptic somatic sites. The cycling of synaptic AMPA receptors only occurs on a much longer timescale with complete exchange requiring at least 16 hr. This cycling is not dependent on protein synthesis or action potential driven network activity. These data suggest a revised model of AMPA receptor trafficking wherein a large internal store of AMPA receptors exchanges rapidly with extrasynaptic somatic AMPA receptors, and these newly inserted AMPA receptors then travel laterally along dendrites to reside stably at synapses."
https://openalex.org/W2133427405,"Neuropilins, secreted semaphorin coreceptors, are expressed in discrete populations of spinal motor neurons, suggesting they provide critical guidance information for the establishment of functional motor circuitry. We show here that motor axon growth and guidance are impaired in the absence of Sema3A-Npn-1 signaling. Motor axons enter the limb precociously, showing that Sema3A controls the timing of motor axon in-growth to the limb. Lateral motor column (LMC) motor axons within spinal nerves are defasciculated as they grow toward the limb and converge in the plexus region. Medial and lateral LMC motor axons show dorso-ventral guidance defects in the forelimb. In contrast, Sema3F-Npn-2 signaling guides the axons of a medial subset of LMC neurons to the ventral limb, but plays no major role in regulating their fasciculation. Thus, Sema3A-Npn-1 and Sema3F-Npn-2 signaling control distinct steps of motor axon growth and guidance during the formation of spinal motor connections."

Two psychoactive drugs, nicotine in cigarettes and Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), in marijuana have the opposite effects on food intake. The former decreases food intake, and the latter stimulates hunger as well as appetite (Cota et al., 2003Cota D. Marsicano G. Tschop M. Grubler Y. Flachskamm C. Schubert M. Auer D. Yassouridis A.

Despite the well-known physiological effects of these agents administered exogenously, relatively little is known of the hypothalamic actions of their endogenous counterparts. Our prior studies demonstrate that nicotine and endogenous acetylcholine enhance GABAergic transmission at lateral hypothalamus (LH) synapses (Jo and Role, 2002Jo Y.H. Role L.W.

The electrophysiological mechanism(s) that underlie the orexigenic effect of cannabinoids remains largely unexplored, and the effects of cannabinoids on synaptic transmission in hypothalamic circuits involved in motivated aspects of feeding are not known. Recent evidence suggests that an endogenous cannabinoid ligand, such as anandamide, increases food intake and body weight (Hao et al., 2000Hao S. Avraham Y. Mechoulam R. Berry E.M.

Genetic deletion of the cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptor (CB1R) in mice results in a decreased body weight, reduced fat mass, and hypophagia (Cota et al., 2003Cota D. Marsicano G. Tschop M.

Invest. 2003; 112: 423-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar). CB1R mRNA is coexpressed with mRNA encoding neuropeptides known to modulate food intake in the hypothalamus, such as corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART), melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH), and orexin/hypocretin (Cota et al., 2003Cota D.

Moreover, recent reports identify cannabinoid receptor (CBR) antagonists (such as SR141716, aka rimonabant) as potent inhibitors of appetite with consequent reduction in body weight (Arnone et al., 1997Arnone M.

Both populations of neurons have been implicated in the regulation of arousal and in motivated aspects of feeding behavior via their widespread and overlapping projections to key cortical, limbic, and basal forebrain areas (Cvetkovic et al., 2003Cvetkovic V.

As LH neurons are implicated in the hedonic or motivational aspects of food intake (Fulton et al., 2000Fulton S. Woodside B. Shizgal P. Modulation of brain reward circuitry by leptin.Science. 2000; 287: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), the appetite-stimulating effects of cannabinoid could involve changes in the excitability of LH neurons. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that activation of presynaptic CB1Rs by released endogenous cannabinoids might regulate inhibitory tone to perifornical LH neurons. Our electrophysiological analysis reveals that perifornical LH neurons are subject to CB1R-mediated depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition (DSI; for reviews, see Alger, 2002Alger B.E.

Endocannabinoid signaling in the brain.Science. 2002; 296: 678-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar). We show that the effects of leptin, an anorexigenic hormone, involve the modulation of endocannabinoid-mediated DSI. Leptin inhibits voltage-gated calcium entry via janus kinase 2 (JAK2) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-dependent signaling, thereby decreasing synthesis and release of endocannabinoids. These results extend prior biochemical studies of leptin-induced decreases in endocannabinoids and are consistent with the hypothesis that the integration of endocannabinoid and leptin signaling regulates the excitability of neurons in appetite-related circuits (Di Marzo et al., 2001Di Marzo V. Goparaju S.K. Wang L. Liu J. Batkai S. Jarai Z. Fezza F. Miura G.I. Palmiter R.D. Sugiura T. Kunos G. Leptin-regulated endocannabinoids are involved in maintaining food intake.Nature. 2001; 410: 822-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar). Our initial experiments identified specific populations of perifornical neurons within acute slice preparations of LH (Jo et al., 2005Jo Y.H. Wiedl D. Role L.W. Cholinergic modulation of appetite-related synapses in mouse lateral hypothalamic slice.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 11133-11144Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We focused our search for possible physiological effects of endocannabinoids on inhibitory inputs to perifornical neurons within the LH by conducting experiments in the presence of a mixture of glutamate receptor blockers (see Experimental Procedures). Under these conditions, all synaptic currents recorded appear to be mediated by GABAA receptors as antagonists (such as 10 μM bicuculline or 10 μM β-hydrastine) blocked all evoked and spontaneous synaptic currents. Our prior studies identified a population of perifornical LH neurons in acute preparations of mouse brain slice, establishing basic electrophysiological and morphological properties that are associated with specific immunocytochemical features (Jo et al., 2005Jo Y.H. Wiedl D. Role L.W. Cholinergic modulation of appetite-related synapses in mouse lateral hypothalamic slice.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 11133-11144Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In the current study, we focused our work on perifornical neurons with the characteristics of type 1/MCH-positive neurons, which are typically large, multipolar neurons with moderate spike accommodation profiles (Figures 1A and 1B), consistent with the studies of van den Pol and colleagues (Gao et al., 2003Gao X.B. Ghosh P.K. Van Den Pol A.N. Neurons synthesizing melanin-concentrating hormone identified by selective reporter gene expression after transfection in vitro: transmitter responses.J.

Physiological properties of hypothalamic MCH neurons identified with selective expression of reporter gene after recombinant virus infection.Neuron. 2004; 42: 635-652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). We provide further support for these basic features of MCH neurons in single-cell reverse transcription (RT)-PCR studies of perifornical LH neurons (Figure 1C). Thirteen of the 25 large, multipolar perifornical LH neurons assayed by RT-PCR were positive for both neuronal enolase and MCH mRNA. The majority of the MCH-positive neurons were also positive for fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), a key enzyme in endocannabinoid catalysis (Piomelli, 2003Piomelli D. The molecular logic of endocannabinoid signalling.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 873-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (1521) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies examined the role of endocannabinoid signaling in the GABAergic synaptic inputs to neurons with similar morphology and electrophysiological profile located less than 200 μM lateral to the fornix. Thus, overall about half of the neurons sampled are likely to be MCH positive. We first tested for depolarization-induced suppression of stimulus-evoked GABAergic inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs). Electrical stimulation of presynaptic inputs within the area ventromedial to the fornix was performed while we recorded from postsynaptic, perifornical LH neurons (Figure 2A). The LH neurons were briefly depolarized from −70 mV to 0 mV for 5 s prior to stimulation of the presynaptic input (Figures 2B1 and 2B2). This protocol has been shown in other brain areas to cause the release of endocannabinoids that then act as retrograde messengers to regulate presynaptic inputs (e.g., Diana et al., 2002Diana M.A. Levenes C. Mackie K. Marty A. Short-term retrograde inhibition of GABAergic synaptic currents in rat Purkinje cells is mediated by endogenous cannabinoids.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 200-208PubMed Google Scholar, Kreitzer and Regehr, 2001Kreitzer A.C. Regehr W.G. Cerebellar depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition is mediated by endogenous cannabinoids.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: RC174PubMed Google Scholar, Wilson and Nicoll, 2001Wilson R.I. Nicoll R.A. Endogenous cannabinoids mediate retrograde signalling at hippocampal synapses.Nature. 2001; 410: 588-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar). Also consistent with an endocannabinoid-based mechanism, the depolarization (prepulse)-induced decrease in stimulus-evoked GABAergic transmission was blocked by inclusion of CB1R antagonists (e.g., AM251; 1 μM; n = 3; Figures 2B2 and 2E). Likewise, treatment with a CB1R agonist, such as WIN 55,212-2 (1 μM) mimicked the effects of the DSI protocol, decreasing the amplitude of evoked IPSCs by 55% ± 10% (Figure 2C; n = 4). Examination of the effects of a single prepulse depolarization in perifornical LH neurons revealed significant inhibition of subsequent stimulus-evoked GABAergic IPSCs in about half of the neurons assayed (eIPSCs versus time; Figure 2D). IPSC amplitude was typically decreased by 58% ± 8% of control levels, and the time constant (τ) of recovery from DSI was about 20 s (Figure 2D; τ = 18 ± 2 s; r = 0.8; n = 24). In another set of experiments, 5 s depolarizing steps preceded each presynaptic stimulation with an interstimulus interval of 5 s. Such repetitive prepulse depolarization resulted in sustained reduction in the amplitude of evoked IPSCs (Figures 2F1 and 2F2). We next tested whether the direct depolarization protocol modulated spontaneous synaptic transmission of GABAergic inputs to LH neurons (sIPSCs). Direct depolarization of perifornical LH neurons decreased ongoing GABAergic transmission, evident in a significant decrease in the frequency of sIPSCs in one-third of the neurons tested (Figure 3A; n = 29). This suppression of sIPSCs persisted after a single prepulse depolarization, with a time constant of ∼4 s (τ = 4.3 ± 0.7 s; r = 0.8; Figure 3B; n = 10). The mean percent decrease in sIPSC frequency was 57% ± 10% (Figure 3B; n = 10 of 29 neurons tested). As in studies of stimulus-evoked GABAergic transmission, we found that exogenous application of a CB1R antagonist blocked depolarization-induced inhibition of spontaneous GABAergic transmission (n = 7; Figure 3A [right panel] and Figure 3C). To test whether DSI could be mimicked by increasing the intracellular concentration of endocannabinoids, we injected a natural CBR agonist, anandamide (100 μM), into the postsynaptic neurons through the recording pipette. Under these conditions, the frequency of sIPSCs was monitored continuously from the time of initial access in whole-cell configuration (i.e., the onset of anandamide infusion) and without direct depolarization of the neuron. There was a significant decrease in the frequency of sIPSCs in ∼40% of neurons tested (mean inhibition: 28% ± 13%; n = 7 of 19 neurons tested; Figures 3D1 and 3D2). The subsequent addition of CB1R antagonists to the bath reversed the anandamide-induced suppression of sIPSCs (Figures 3D2 and 3E). Taken together, these findings are consistent with the previous studies (Gerdeman et al., 2002Gerdeman G.L. Ronesi J. Lovinger D.M. Postsynaptic endocannabinoid release is critical to long-term depression in the striatum.Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 446-451PubMed Google Scholar, Ronesi et al., 2004Ronesi J. Gerdeman G.L. Lovinger D.M. Disruption of endocannabinoid release and striatal long-term depression by postsynaptic blockade of endocannabinoid membrane transport.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 1673-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) and a proposed model of depolarization-induced suppression in LH, where depolarization of the postsynaptic perifornical LH neurons results in their release of endocannabinoids and the consequent activation of presynaptic CB1Rs, thereby depressing GABAergic transmission. Having found that the excitability of perifornical LH neurons can be tuned by endocannabinoids, we next examined the potential of an anorexigenic hormone, leptin, to counter the effects of the orexigenic endocannabinoid signal. We induced DSI by prepulse depolarization of the postsynaptic neurons as before, assaying the effects on evoked (Figures 4A and 4B) and spontaneous GABAergic transmission with or without leptin treatment for ∼10 min (60 nM; Figure 7E). Whereas brief depolarization decreased the amplitude of evoked IPSCs by 47% ± 11%, the same protocol was without effect on the evoked IPSCs following leptin treatment for ∼10 min (n = 5; Figure 4B). Leptin had similar effects on the depolarization-induced suppression of spontaneous GABAergic transmission (see below). The observation that leptin blocks DSI of both evoked and spontaneous inhibitory transmission in LH could be due to leptin interaction at one or more steps in the proposed sequence of endocannabinoid synthesis and release from perifornical LH neurons or in the CB1R-mediated suppression of GABA transmission. We next tested whether leptin treatment interferes with endocannabinoid signaling due to a direct block of CB1Rs. As shown in Figures 4C and 4D, application of a CB1R agonist (WIN 55,212-2; 1 μM) decreased the amplitude of evoked IPSCs in the presence of leptin (60 nM; n = 4). Leptin does not interfere with CB1R activation per se: the mean inhibition of evoked IPSCs was the same with or without leptin plus the CB1R agonist (Figure 4E). We next explored the mechanism(s) by which leptin could interfere with endocannabinoid signaling in assays of leptin effects on depolarization-induced synthesis/release of endocannabinoids from perifornical LH neurons. The regulation of endocannabinoid by leptin appears to be independent of transcriptional effects, as blockade of DSI occurred within minutes (e.g., see Figure 5A). The synthesis of endocannabinoids in response to direct depolarization is strongly dependent on increased calcium influx (for review, see Di Marzo et al., 1998Di Marzo V. Melck D. Bisogno T. De Petrocellis L. Endocannabinoids: endogenous cannabinoid receptor ligands with neuromodulatory action.Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 521-528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, Piomelli, 2003Piomelli D.

Endocannabinoid signaling in the brain.Science. 2002; 296: 678-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar). Hence, we reasoned that leptin-inhibition of DSI may be due, at least in part, to a leptin-induced decrease in calcium entry via the voltage-gated calcium currents that normally support depolarization-induced endocannabinoid production (Figure 5A). To test this possibility, we directly monitored the amplitude of voltage-gated calcium currents in LH neurons by depolarizing the neurons from −80 to 0 mV for 100 ms in the presence or absence of leptin. Bath application of leptin (30 nM) strongly inhibited voltage-gated calcium currents in the LH with the mean inhibition of 54% ± 6% (Figures 5B1 and 5B2; n = 5). We further explored the intracellular signal transduction mechanisms by which leptin modulates voltage-gated calcium currents (Figure 5A). Leptin receptors are members of the cytokine receptor superfamily that interact with JAK/STAT via specific intracellular docking sites. Leptin's interaction with its receptor causes the activation of JAK2, which in turn can lead to the activation of other downstream kinase cascades, including MAPK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-K) (Figure 5A). As shown in Figures 5C and 5F, leptin receptor-mediated inhibition of voltage-gated calcium currents is blocked following treatment of LH slices with a JAK2 inhibitor, AG490 (50 μM and 5 min; n = 6), consistent with the involvement of JAK2 in the regulation of calcium current by leptin. Other studies have implicated both MAPK (Hegyi et al., 2004Hegyi K. Fulop K. Kovacs K. Toth S. Falus A. Leptin-induced signal transduction pathways.Cell Biol. Int. 2004; 28: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) and PI 3-K (Lee et al., 2003Lee J.W. Swick A.G. Romsos D.R. Leptin constrains phospholipase C-protein kinase C-induced insulin secretion via a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent pathway.Exp. Biol. Med. (Maywood). 2003; 228: 175-182PubMed Google Scholar) as potential downstream mediators of JAK/STAT signaling. To test whether leptin-stimulated JAK/STAT regulates voltage-gated calcium currents via activation of MAPK, we examined the effect of the MAPK inhibitor U0126. As with JAK2 inhibitor, incubation of slices with MAPK inhibitor U0126 (10 μM; 5 min; n = 5) blocked the leptin-mediated inhibition of voltage-gated calcium currents (Figures 5D and 5F). In contrast to our results implicating both JAK and MAPK in leptin-induced inhibition of calcium currents, inhibitors of PI 3-K (200 nM wortmannin) were without effect; leptin still effectively inhibited voltage-gated calcium currents (mean inhibition: 52% ± 7%; n = 3; Figures 5E and 5F). Our data are consistent with the involvement of JAK2 and MAPK in the regulation of voltage-dependent calcium channels by leptin. Having found that leptin modulates voltage-gated calcium current in a manner consistent with the observed leptin-induced inhibition of DSI, we next tested the potential contribution of calcium influx to the extent of DSI at LH synapses. First, we examined the effects of increasing external [Ca2+] on the profile of DSI. Raising [Ca2+]ext from 2.5 to 5 mM significantly prolonged DSI of spontaneous GABAergic transmission, increasing the time constant for recovery from 4 to 31 s (compare Figures 3B and 6B; n = 8 cells). Hence, the duration of DSI appears to be regulated by the amount of calcium influx. In another set of experiments, we decreased the intracellular [Ca2+] by increasing the concentration of the calcium buffer, BAPTA, in the patch pipette solution over the range of 0.2 mM (standard conditions) to 10 mM. Raising [BAPTA]int levels above 5 mM prevented DSI of GABAergic transmission in LH (Figure 6C). Taken together, these results are compatible with the idea that intracellular Ca2+ levels are an important determinant of the extent of DSI and are consistent with prior studies demonstrating that endocannabinoid synthesis is dependent on cellular levels of calcium (for review, see Di Marzo et al., 1998Di Marzo V. Melck D. Bisogno T. De Petrocellis L. Endocannabinoids: endogenous cannabinoid receptor ligands with neuromodulatory action.Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 521-528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). We further tested the relationship between depolarization-induced Ca2+ conductance and DSI by direct measure of both parameters. We isolated calcium currents (ICa) by addition of broad spectrum blockers of both IK and INa (see Experimental Procedures). Application of depolarizing voltage steps to postsynaptic perifornical LH neurons activated ICa and elicited DSI as measured by decreased spontaneous GABAergic transmission. The extent of DSI was steeply related to changes in the total charge transfer measured as integrated ICa; even a 20% decrease in the integrated ICa was sufficient to block DSI (Figures 6D1, 6D2, and 6E). Having established that leptin can regulate voltage-gated calcium currents, subsequent studies tested for a potential role of endogenous signaling via leptin-endocannabinoid interactions, using leptin-deficient (ob/ob) mice of the FVB strain (Haluzik et al., 2004Haluzik M. Colombo C. Gavrilova O. Chua S. Wolf N. Chen M. Stannard B. Dietz K.R. Le Roith D. Reitman M.L. Genetic background (C57BL/6J versus FVB/N) strongly influences the severity of diabetes and insulin resistance in ob/ob mice.Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 3258-3264Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In wild-type FVB littermates (+/+), we observed the same time course and the same extent of DSI as observed in C57BL/6 wild-type mice (Figure 7A). In contrast, brief depolarization of perifornical LH neurons induced a more profound DSI in slices from ob/ob mice than in those from wild-type littermates (Figure 7B). Thus, the time constant for recovery of DSI was increased about 6-fold in ob/ob versus +/+ littermates (Figures 7A and 7B; τ: +/+ = 4.5 ± 1 s, ob/ob = 30 ± 6 s; mean percent of inhibition: +/+ = 54 ± 17, ob/ob = 57 ± 3; n = 6/19 and n = 9/27, respectively). DSI of the evoked IPSCs was also more prolonged in ob/ob than in +/+ mice (Figures 7C and 7D; τ: +/+ = ∼33 ± 3.5 s, ob/ob = 82 ± 14 s; τ over t = 0–120 s for both; mean percent of inhibition: +/+ = 48 ± 9, ob/ob = 53 ± 19; n = 3 and n = 5, respectively). Finally, as the blockade of DSI by leptin seems to be due, at least in part, to inhibition of voltage-gated calcium current, we tested whether there might be an increase in calcium currents in leptin-deficient animals. Significant increases in the mean amplitude of voltage-gated calcium currents in LH neurons of ob/ob mice (+/+: 818 ± 90 pA, n = 17; ob/ob: 1096 ± 90 pA, n = 17; p < 0.05; Figure 7E) were detected without changes in capacitance (+/+: 14.5 ± 0.6 pF, n = 14; ob/ob: 14.5 ± 0.7 pF, n = 13). Neither the frequency nor the mean amplitude of sIPSCs was significantly different between +/+ and ob/ob mice, although we noted a trend toward increased baseline sIPSC frequency in ob/ob mice (frequency: +/+ = 9.3 ± 2 Hz, ob/ob = 13.1 ± 2.5 Hz; amplitude: +/+ = 46.1 ± 5 pA, ob/ob = 58.6 ± 6 pA; n = 19 and 27, respectively; p > 0.05). The application of exogenous leptin in slices from ob/ob mice blocked DSI, similar to its effects in wild-type littermates (Figure 7F; n = 4). Overal"

We have applied multielectrode array recording to characterize murine ipRGCs. We find that all ipRGC photosensitivity is melanopsin dependent. At least three populations of ipRGCs are present in the postnatal day 8 (P8) murine retina: slow onset, sensitive, fast off (type I); slow onset, insensitive, slow off (type II); and rapid onset, sensitive, very slow off (type III). Recordings from adult rd/rd retinas reveal cells comparable to postnatal types II and III. Recordings from early postnatal retinas demonstrate intrinsic light responses from P0. Early light responses are transient and insensitive but by P6 show increased photosensitivity and persistence. These results demonstrate that ipRGCs are the first light-sensitive cells in the retina and suggest previously unappreciated diversity in this cell population."
https://openalex.org/W2129828870,"All four mammalian Notch proteins interact with a single DNA-binding protein (RBP-jkappa), yet they are not equivalent in activating target genes. Parallel assays of three Notch-responsive promoters in several cell lines revealed that relative activation strength is dependent on protein module and promoter context more than the cellular context. Each Notch protein reads binding site orientation and distribution on the promoter differently; Notch1 performs extremely well on paired sites, and Notch3 prefers single sites in conjunction with a proximal zinc finger transcription factor. Although head-head sites can elicit a Notch response on their own, use of CBS (CSL binding site) in tail-tail orientation is context-dependent. Bias for specific DNA elements is achieved by interplay between the N-terminal RAM (RBP-jkappa-associated molecule/ankyrin region), which interprets CBS proximity and orientation, and the C-terminal transactivation domain that interacts specifically with the transcription machinery or nearby factors. To confirm the prediction that modular design underscores the evolution of functional divergence between Notch proteins, we generated a synthetic Notch protein (Notch1 ankyrin with Notch3 transactivation domain) that displayed superior signaling strength on the hes5 promoter. Consistent with the prediction that preferred targets (Hes1) should respond faster and at lower Notch concentration than other targets, we showed that Hes5-GFP was extinguished fast and recovered slowly, whereas Hes1-GFP was inhibited late and recovered quickly after a pulse of DAPT in metanephroi cultures."
https://openalex.org/W2042432891,"A rare type of mammalian retinal ganglion cell (RGC) expresses the photopigment melanopsin and is a photoreceptor. These intrinsically photosensitive RGCs (ipRGCs) drive circadian-clock resetting, pupillary constriction, and other non-image-forming photic responses. Both the light responses of ipRGCs and the behaviors they drive are remarkably sustained, raising the possibility that, unlike rods and cones, ipRGCs do not adjust their sensitivity according to lighting conditions (“adaptation”). We found, to the contrary, that ipRGC sensitivity is plastic, strongly influenced by lighting history. When exposed to a constant, bright background, the background-evoked response decayed, and responses to superimposed flashes grew in amplitude, indicating light adaptation. After extinction of a light-adapting background, sensitivity recovered progressively in darkness, indicating dark adaptation. Because these adjustments in sensitivity persisted when synapses were blocked, they constitute “photoreceptor adaptation” rather than “network adaptation.” Implications for the mechanisms generating various non-image-forming visual responses are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2062431479,"In addition to affecting respiration and vascular tone, deviations from normal CO(2) alter pH, consciousness, and seizure propensity. Outside the brainstem, however, the mechanisms by which CO(2) levels modify neuronal function are unknown. In the hippocampal slice preparation, increasing CO(2), and thus decreasing pH, increased the extracellular concentration of the endogenous neuromodulator adenosine and inhibited excitatory synaptic transmission. These effects involve adenosine A(1) and ATP receptors and depend on decreased extracellular pH. In contrast, decreasing CO(2) levels reduced extracellular adenosine concentration and increased neuronal excitability via adenosine A(1) receptors, ATP receptors, and ecto-ATPase. Based on these studies, we propose that CO(2)-induced changes in neuronal function arise from a pH-dependent modulation of adenosine and ATP levels. These findings demonstrate a mechanism for the bidirectional effects of CO(2) on neuronal excitability in the forebrain."
https://openalex.org/W2171919975,"Input to the central nervous system from olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) is modulated presynaptically. We investigated the functional organization of this inhibition and its role in odor coding by imaging neurotransmitter release from OSNs in slices and in vivo in mice expressing synaptopHluorin, an optical indicator of vesicle exocytosis. Release from OSNs was strongly suppressed by heterosynaptic, intraglomerular inhibition. In contrast, inhibitory connections between glomeruli mediated only weak lateral inhibition of OSN inputs in slices and did not do so in response to odorant stimulation in vivo. Blocking presynaptic inhibition in vivo increased the amplitude of odorant-evoked input to glomeruli but had little effect on spatial patterns of glomerular input. Thus, intraglomerular inhibition limits the strength of olfactory input to the CNS, whereas interglomerular inhibition plays little or no role. This organization allows for control of input sensitivity while maintaining the spatial maps of glomerular activity thought to encode odorant identity."
https://openalex.org/W2006742868,"The lower rhombic lip (LRL) is a germinal zone in the dorsal hindbrain productive of tangentially migrating neurons, streaming extramurally (mossy fiber neurons) or intramurally (climbing fiber neurons). Here we show that LRL territory, operationally defined by Wnt1 expression, is parceled into molecular subdomains predictive of cell fate. Progressing dorsoventrally, Lmx1a and Gdf7 expression identifies the primordium for hindbrain choroid plexus epithelial cells; Math1, for mossy fiber neurons; and immediately ventral to Math1 yet within Wnt1(+) territory, a climbing fiber primordium dominated by Ngn1-expressing cells. Elimination of Pax6 results in expansion of this Ngn1(+) progenitor pool and reduction in the Math1(+) pool, with accompanying later enlargement of the climbing fiber nucleus and reductions in mossy fiber nuclei. Pax6 loss also disrupts Msx expression cell-nonautonomously, suggesting Pax6 may influence LRL progenitor identity indirectly through potentiating BMP signaling. These studies suggest that underlying the diversity and proportions of fates produced by the LRL is a precise suborganization regulated by Pax6."

Although TRPC5 was stimulated by agonists at G-protein-coupled receptors, TRPC5 activation by LPC occurred downstream and independently of G-protein signaling. The effect was not due to the generation of reactive oxygen species or because of a detergent effect of LPC. LPC activated TRPC5 when applied to excised membrane patches and thus has a relatively direct action on the channel structure, either because of a phospholipid binding site on the channel or because of sensitivity of the channel to perturbation of the bilayer by certain lipids. Activation showed dependence on side-chain length and the chemical head-group.

The channels have received considerable attention over the past decade, but their mechanisms of activation and endogenous regulators remain quite poorly understood.

Ca2+ permeability of TRPC5 allows its activity to be detected by the fluo-4 intracellular Ca2+ indicator dye on a 96-well real-time fluorescence platform. Here we see that LPC and the related lipid LPI evoke responses in TRPC5-expressing cells but not the controls and that the solvent for LPC and LPI, methanol, has no effect (Fig. 1, a and b). LPC and LPI responses have the same magnitude, but the LPI response has faster onset and some subsequent decay. There is specificity for TRPC5 because the hydrogen peroxide- and arachidonic acid-activated TRPM2 channel (19McHugh D. Flemming R. Xu S.Z. Perraud A.L. Beech D.J. J. Biol.

For further and more quantitative analysis, we used microscopy-based single-cell imaging with the ratiometric Ca2+ indicator dye fura-PE3. Similarly, LPC is an activator. Responses developed over a period of a few minutes (Fig. 2a) and were sustained for up to 20 min (data not shown). LPC and LPI have different head-groups, choline and inositol, but evoke responses of the same magnitude (Fig. 2b). The above experiments used LPC C16:0. In contrast, LPC with a shorter side chain (LPC C6:0) has no effect (Fig. 2b). Phospholipase A2 enzymes hydrolyze phosphatidylcholine to yield LPC and arachidonic acid. This other product, arachidonic acid, fails to activate TRPC5 (Fig. 2b). Basic Characteristics of the Effect of LPC—The response of TRPC5-expressing cells to LPC was lost in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, showing that the effect relates to TRPC5-dependent Ca2+ influx (Fig. 2, c and d). LPC contains a choline group, choline is an agonist at muscarinic receptors, and muscarinic agonists activate TRPC5 in HEK-293 cells. However, choline has only a minor role in the effect of LPC because LPI mimics the effect of LPC (Figs. 1 and 2; see also Fig. 4a), and there is substantial resistance of the LPC response to the muscarinic antagonist atropine (Fig. 2d). LPC may generate reactive oxygen species (17Takeshita S. Inoue N. Gao D. Rikitake Y. Kawashima S. Tawa R. Sakurai H. Yokoyama M. J. Atheroscler. Thromb. 2000; 7: 238-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and act via such intermediates. However, TRPM2 is activated by reactive oxygen species (20Hara Y. Wakamori M. Ishii M. Maeno E.

Cell. 2002; 9: 163-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar) but not LPC (Fig. 1c), and activation of TRPC5 by LPC is unaffected by vitamin E, a scavenger of reactive oxygen species (Fig. 2d). The prefix “lyso” in LPC refers to the property of this substance to cause cell lysis by what is presumed to be a detergent effect on the membrane. The primary evidence against the LPC effect reflecting such a detergent action is that responses did not occur in the control (Tet-) cells (Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). Secondly, for comparison, the expected nonspecific chemical detergent effect can be demonstrated by using Triton X-100 (Fig. 2e). These experiments show the detergent response in control (Tet-) cells and also reveal that Tet+ cells have a weaker response, which is opposite to that found for LPC. The mechanism for this protective effect of TRPC5 is unknown, but the data showed that TRPC5 does not inadvertently increase sensitivity of the cells to chemical detergent.FIGURE 5Activation by physiological lysophospholipids and in native cells. a-c, mean fura-PE3 Ca2+ imaging data for TRPC5-expressing (Tet+)or control (Tet-) cells. a-c and f, gadolinium (10 μm) was continuously present. a, for Tet+ cells, concentration-response curve for LPC C16:0 responses after 10 min (24-130 cells per point); >10 μm LPC was not tested because such concentrations risk cell lysis. b and c, mean responses to 10 μm natural LPC from bovine brain with (b, 149/129 Tet± cells) or without (c, 98/147 Tet± cells) preincubation and the continuous presence of 5 μm fatty-acid-free bovine serum albumin. d and e, cross-section of part of the mouse aorta (lumen to the left) stained with T5Chk anti-TRPC5 antibody (d) or as a control in the absence of primary antibody (e), showing endogenous expression of TRPC5 in the smooth muscle cells (red staining, arrow). f, typical whole-cell recording from a freshly isolated aortic smooth muscle cell showing the effect of bath-applied 10 μm LPC C16:0 starting 10-min after breaking the cell-attached patch to start whole-cell recording.

Whole-cell recordings in voltage clamp mode show that LPC activates current in TRPC5-expressing cells with a time course (Fig. 3a) similar to that found in Ca2+ imaging experiments (Fig. 2c). Fig. 3b shows that the evoked current has the fingerprint-inflected TRPC5 current-voltage relationship (I-V) (7Zeng F. Xu S.Z. Jackson P.K. McHugh D. Kumar B. Fountain S.J. Beech D.J. J. Physiol.

Neurosci. 2005; 25: 1234-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Given the ability to definitively identify activated TRPC5, we used this approach to further elucidate chemical requirements for activation. Consistent with data in Fig. 2b, LPC chain length is important; TRPC5 activation occurs with chain lengths greater than 12 (Fig. 3c). Choline (the head-group of LPC) has no effect (Fig. 3d). Without the head-group, LPC is palmitic acid, but because of poor solubility, we used palmitoleic acid, which is the same except for one unsaturated bond. Palmitoleic acid had a weak and statistically insignificant activating effect on TRPC5 (Fig. 3e). These data suggest that the combination of the head-group and side chain of sufficient length is important for activation. The dependence on chain length implies that lipid solubility is a requirement. LPC Acts Independently of G-protein Signaling—Because TRPC5 is activated by agonists at G-protein-coupled receptors (8Plant T.D. Schaefer M. Cell Calcium. 2003; 33: 441-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 10Schaefer M. Plant T.D. Obukhov A.G. Hofmann T. Gudermann T. Schultz G. J. Biol.

Neuron. 2001; 29: 645-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar) and there are G-protein-coupled receptors for LPC (14Ishii I. Fukushima N. Ye X. Chun J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 321-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar), it is necessary to explore whether LPC acts via one of these receptors endogenously expressed in HEK-293 cells. However, the amplitude of the response to LPC is much bigger than that to activation of endogenous muscarinic receptors by carbachol (Fig. 3f), and robust LPC responses occur without GTP or ATP in the patch pipette, a condition unfavorable for G-protein signaling; for example, with such a pipette solution, carbachol responses failed in five of nine cells within one batch of experiments, whereas the LPC C16:0 response occurred in every cell. Furthermore, we had observed in Ca2+ imaging experiments that LPC responses are unaffected by pretreatment of cells with pertussis toxin, an inhibitor of Gαo/i proteins (p > 0.05, n = 30 cells and six independent experiments). Therefore, we focused on the hypothesis that LPC is acting on TRPC5 independently of G-protein signaling. To investigate the role of G-proteins, LPC responses were compared with and without GDP-β-S in the pipette because GDP-β-S is a hydrolysis-resistant analogue of GDP that locks G-proteins in the inactive state. Consistent with our hypothesis, the LPC response is unaffected by intracellular dialysis with GDP-β-S (Fig. 3f). The response to carbachol is, however, abolished, showing a marked contrast between the effects of the two agonists (Fig. 3f). There is little or no effect of LPC on control (Tet-) cells, and the small signal that does occur has a linear rather than TRPC5 I-V and is prevented by the lanthanide gadolinium (Fig. 3f), which blocks many endogenous cationic channels but not TRPC5 (7Zeng F. Xu S.Z. Jackson P.K. McHugh D. Kumar B. Fountain S.J. Beech D.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2004; 15: 739-750Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 8Plant T.D. Schaefer M. Cell Calcium. 2003; 33: 441-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Activation in Excised Membrane Patches—If lysophospholipids do not activate TRPC5 via G-protein-coupled receptors, how are they acting? We considered that they do not act via a signaling pathway but more directly on the channel complex; that is, TRPC5 has a novel lysophospholipid-sensing capability. The patch clamp technique provides a powerful method to test such an idea by enabling the excision of patches of plasma membrane from the cell. Outside-out patch recordings were made with GDP-β-S at the intracellular face of the membrane (in the patch pipette) and the extracellular face of the channels facing the bath solution. Consistent with a relatively direct action, lysophospholipids evoke responses that are characteristic of TRPC5 in Tet+, but not Tet-, cells (Fig. 4, a and b). Because the carbon chain length is important (Figs. 2b and 3c), the lysophospholipid effect most likely results from an interaction with the lipid bilayer or with a lipid interaction site associated with the channel. We therefore explored whether LPC is also effective at the inner face of the membrane, using inside-out patch recording. There is activation (Fig. 4, c and d). The small physical size of inside-out patches has the advantage of enabling single channel recordings, and these revealed LPC-evoked unitary current events with conductance as reported previously for TRPC5 (Fig. 4, e and f) (10Schaefer M. Plant T.D. Obukhov A.G. Hofmann T. Gudermann T. Schultz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17517-17526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Because outside-out and inside-out patches are detached from the cell, the presence of LPC responses in these patches not only suggests a relatively direct action on the channels but also rules out forward trafficking of vesicles (6Bezzerides V.J. Ramsey I.S. Kotecha S. Greka A. Clapham D.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 709-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar) as the mechanism underlying the action of LPC. Activation by Physiological Lipid—We hypothesized that activation of TRPC5 by LPC C16:0 might be physiologically important because C16:0 is a common chain length of natural LPC (14Ishii I. Fukushima N. Ye X. Chun J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 321-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar, 15Yan J.J. Jung J.S. Lee J.E. Lee J. Huh S.O. Kim H.S. Jung K.C. Cho J.Y. Nam J.S. Suh H.W. Kim Y.H. Song D.K. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Determination of the concentration-response curve for LPC C16:0 shows effects in the concentration-range of 0.1-10 μm (Fig. 5a) and thus shows that LPC is effective at the lower end of the 5-180 μm concentration range reported for physiological systems (14Ishii I. Fukushima N. Ye X. Chun J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 321-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar, 16Okita M. Gaudette D.C. Mills G.B. Holub B.J. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 71: 31-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). To further explore the relevance, we considered that native LPC is not only LPC C16:0 but a mixture of chain lengths. Testing an isolate of natural LPC shows that it too is a strong TRPC5 activator (Fig. 5b). Native LPC, in some contexts, is also in dynamic equilibrium between free and protein-bound forms. To mimic this effect, natural LPC was tested in the continuous presence of fatty acid-free albumin. The effect of LPC was retained, although reduced in amplitude (Fig. 5c), consistent with there being a lower free LPC concentration. Therefore, the data support the notion of LPC as a physiological activator of TRPC5. Native Cells Endogenously Expressing TRPC5—We further explored the potential relevance of the LPC effect by focusing on freshly isolated vascular smooth muscle cells because of the roles phospholipids play in cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis (17Takeshita S. Inoue N. Gao D. Rikitake Y. Kawashima S. Tawa R. Sakurai H. Yokoyama M. J. Atheroscler. Thromb. 2000; 7: 238-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Complementary to mRNA studies (4Beech D.J. Muraki K. Flemming R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2004; 559: 685-706Crossref Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 21Facemire C.S. Mohler P.J. Arendshorst W.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: F546-F551Google Scholar), we show that TRPC5 protein exists in smooth muscle cells of native mouse aorta (Fig. 5, d and e). We also show that these cells have a previously unrecognized Gd3+-resistant and G-protein-independent response to LPC C16:0 (Fig. 5f), occurring with a time course similar to that found for TRPC5 activation in HEK cells (Fig. 3a). Current occurred in 7 out of 12 smooth muscle cells and averaged -207.3 ± 83.4 pA at -80 mV, reversing near 0 mV, as for TRPC5. The I-V is relatively linear (data not shown), which suggests that it is not explained by TRPC5 alone but by a heteromultimeric assembly, consistent with expression of additional TRP channels in smooth muscle cells (4Beech D.J. Muraki K. Flemming R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2004; 559: 685-706Crossref Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Native HEK-293 cells do not share the Gd3+-resistant LPC response (Fig. 3f), possibly because there is lack of native TRPC5 expression (22Wu X. Babnigg G. Villereal M.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C526-C536Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is an attractive idea that lysophospholipids might represent a point of convergence of the diverse general signals already known to stimulate TRPC5, including muscarinic receptor-activation and store depletion (7Zeng F. Xu S.Z. Jackson P.K. McHugh D. Kumar B. Fountain S.J. Beech D.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2004; 15: 739-750Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar), both of which have the capability to stimulate phospholipase A2 and generate LPC (23Felder C.C. Dieter P. Kinsella J. Tamura K. Kanterman R.Y. Axelrod J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1990; 255: 1140-1147PubMed Google Scholar, 24Wolf M.J. Wang J. Turk J. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1522-1526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Consistent with this idea, study of native store-operated channels has shown activation by LPC or LPI and suggested that these lipids are downstream of phospholipase A2 in the coupling mechanism between stores and store-operated channels (25Smani T. Zakharov S.I. Csutora P. Leno E. Trepakova E.S. Bolotina V.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Mechanism of Action of LPC—Primary findings of this study are that LPC is a novel activator of TRPC5 and that this occurs through a relatively direct action on the channel. There is a strong suggestion that the effect does not occur via a G-protein-coupled receptor or free radicals and does not require significant co-factors because the effect is preserved in the sparse environment of excised membrane patches. The effect has specificity because TRPM2 channels are not activated, and chemical detergent and arachidonic acid do not mimic the effect of LPC on TRPC5. Therefore, it is our hypothesis either that LPC is a direct agonist at the TRPC5 channel complex or that TRPC5 has sensitivity to the structure of the lipid bilayer such that it is activated when the concentration of certain lipids, such as LPC, increases in the bilayer. Distinguishing between these two concepts is a considerable challenge. Nevertheless, our data have raised intriguing questions about the underlying mechanism of activation. The poor effects of arachidonic and palmitoleic acids indicated that it may not be a simple matter of insertion of a long carbon side chain in the bilayer. That LPC and LPI are more effective suggests that the side chain needs a bulky head-group, implying that physical distortion of the bilayer is involved. Such a hypothesis could be reconciled with the excised patch data if, in this context, LPC has the capacity to flip to the other side of the bilayer surprisingly rapidly; that is, within a few minutes. Alternatively, the mechanisms of the intracellular and extracellular effects may be different. Future detailed studies of the chemical requirements will resolve such issues. General Conclusion—We suggest a novel concept for TRPC5 as a direct sensor of lysophospholipids, a lipid ionotropic receptor, stepping it aside from the mystique surrounding its controversial store- and receptor-operated properties (1Putney Jr., J.W.

The developing tooth is an excellent model for studying the molecular mechanisms of morphogenesis. Tooth development is regulated by sequential and reciprocal interactions between the neural crest-derived mesenchyme and the oral ectoderm (1Thesleff I. Hurmerinta K.

Ectomesenchymal cells surrounding the bud form the dental papilla, which later develop into dentin-secreting odontoblasts and the tooth pulp. Following the bud stage, the tooth germ develops to the cap and bell stages, and dental epithelium differentiates into polarized and elongated enamel-secreting ameloblast. The basement membrane is a thin, sheet-like extracellular matrix, which is present in most tissues. The basement membrane separates epithelium and mesenchyme and surrounds many cell types, such as muscle, fat, peripheral nerve, and endothelia. The basement membrane plays a role in organogenesis by supporting cells and providing signals for cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation (5Martin G.R. Timpl R. Kuhn K. Adv.

Basement membranes contain laminin, type IV collagen, perlecan, nidogen/entactin, and other molecules, but their structural compositions differ in tissues, developmental stages, and diseases, which reflects the diverse biological functions of the basement membrane. Laminin is a heterotrimeric glycoprotein, consisting of three genetically distinct α, β, and γ chains. There are five α and three each of β and γ chains, which form 15 isoforms of laminin (laminin-1 to -15) with different chain combinations (8Miner J.H. Yurchenco P.D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

These results suggest that the α5 chain-containing laminin-10/11 has multiple functional roles for the development and establishment of tissue architecture. In developing tooth, mRNA for laminin α3 and α5 are expressed by the dental epithelium, whereas mRNA for the other three laminin α chains, α1, α2, and α4, are expressed primarily by the dental mesenchyme (16Salmivirta K.

Laminin-10/11 are the major laminins in the tooth basement membrane, which appears at the initial stage of tooth development. Laminin α5 expression is diminished when dental epithelium differentiates to enamel matrix-secreting ameloblasts. The basement membrane begins to degrade before the preameloblasts begin their differentiation to ameloblasts, and a new structure, the enamel matrix, is formed at the secretory stage (20Fukumoto S. Kiba T. Hall B. Iehara N. Nakamura T. Longenecker G. Krebsbach P.H. Nanci A. Kulkarni A.B. Yamada Y. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 973-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). At the later terminal differentiation stage of ameloblasts, laminin α3 synthesis begins. Thus, laminin α5 is a major laminin α chain in tooth basement membrane during early development. However, the role of laminin α5 in tooth development is not known. Integrin α3β1, α6β1, and α6β4, as well as Lutheran and α-dystroglycan, have been reported to be receptors for laminin-10/11 (21Kikkawa Y. Sanzen N. Fujiwara H. Sonnenberg A. Sekiguchi K. J.

Integrin α3, α6, and β4 subunits are expressed by dental epithelium, whereas a majority of integrin β1 is expressed by both dental epithelium and mesenchyme with stronger expression in the mesenchyme (25Salmivirta K. Gullberg D. Hirsch E. Altruda F. Ekblom P. Dev. Dyn. 1996; 205: 104-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the major integrin of dental epithelium for laminin-10/11 is integrin α6β4. Integrin α6β4 is a receptor for laminin-5 (LM-332) and laminin-10/11 and is expressed in epithelial, Schwann, and endothelial cell types, as well as double-negative T cells. In basal cells of stratified and transitional epithelia, integrin α6β4 is concentrated at the hemidesmosomes, adhesive junctions connected to the keratin cytoskeleton. The unique feature of integrin α6β4 is the large cytoplasmic domain of the β4 subunit, which appears to interact directly with both BPAG-2 and plectin/HD-1 that form the inner plaque of the hemidesmosomes. Recent studies revealed that integrin α6β4 has signaling functions (26Mercurio A.M. Rabinovitz I. Shaw L.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 541-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of β4 of integrin α6β4 promotes recruitment of the signaling adaptor protein Shc (27Mainiero F. Murgia C. Wary K.K. Curatola A.M. Pepe A. Blumemberg M. Westwick J.K. Der C.J. Giancotti F.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2365-2375Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Upon tyrosine phosphorylation, Shc binds to the Grb2·mSOS complex and activates Ras-Raf-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (28Mainiero F. Pepe A. Yeon M. Ren Y. Giancotti F.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 241-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)-Rac/Cdc42-c-Jun-NH2-terminal kinase signaling cascades are also activated under the control of phosphorylation of the integrin β4 cytoplasmic tail and regulate cell migration and polarity (29Shaw L.M.

Here we study the role of laminin α5 in tooth development using Lama5 knock-out mice. Mutant mice develop a smaller tooth germ and have defects in the enamel knot and cusp. In the tooth bud of mutant mice, distribution patterns of integrin α6β4 are changed, and basal dental epithelial cell polarity is lost. Using primary dental epithelium culture, we show that PI3K and downstream molecules Rac1/Cdc42 regulate cell spreading and filopodia formation of the dental epithelium. These findings suggest that laminin α5 plays a role in cell polarity and proliferation of the dental epithelium and is essential for tooth morphogenesis. Materials—The primary antibodies were anti-collagen IV (Ab756) and anti-PCNA (Mab424) from CHEMICON; anti-integrin α3 (6B3) from Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (Iowa City, IA); anti-integrin α6 (GoH3), integrin β1 (9EG7, HMβ1-1), and integrin β4 (346-11A) from BD Biosciences. Secondary antibodies, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rat IgG and anti-mouse IgG, were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. Rhodamine-phalloidin and wortmannin were from Sigma. LY294002, PP1, PP2, SB203580, and herbimycin A were from Calbiochem. PD98059 was from Cell Signaling. Knock-out Mice for Lama5—We used two lines of Lama5-deficient mice. The original Lama5 knock-out mice were created by deleting a 3.5-kb fragment of Lama5 coding for amino-terminal domains of the protein (13Miner J.H. Cunningham J. Sanes J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1713-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Heterozygous mice develop normally, but homozygous mice die at E14–E18 with multiple tissue abnormalities (13Miner J.H. Cunningham J. Sanes J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1713-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). A second, independent line of Lama5 knock-out mice (Lama5 Trap mice) was generated from embryonic stem cells carrying an insertion into the intron of Lama5 of a gene trap vector (33Yin Y. Kikkawa Y. Mudd J.L. Skarnes W.C. Sanes J.R. Miner J.H. Genesis. 2003; 36: 114-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This vector, which was designed to trap genes encoding secreted and transmembrane proteins expressed in embryonic stem cells, lacks a promoter but has a splice acceptor and sequences encoding a transmembrane domain and a fusion between β-galactosidase and neomycin phosphotransferase II (βgeo) (34Leighton P.A. Mitchell K.J. Goodrich L.V. Lu X. Pinson K. Scherz P. Skarnes W.C. Tessier-Lavigne M. Nature. 2001; 410: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 35Mitchell K.J. Pinson K.I. Kelly O.G.

Genet. 2001; 28: 241-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Insertion into Lama5 resulted in a fusion protein containing the first 1763 amino acids of laminin α5 (domains VI through part of IVa), the transmembrane domain, and βgeo (33Yin Y. Kikkawa Y. Mudd J.L. Skarnes W.C. Sanes J.R. Miner J.H. Genesis. 2003; 36: 114-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Although a major portion of the laminin α5 short arm is contained in the fusion protein, it is incapable of assembling with laminin β and γ chains and is therefore nonfunctional. Indeed, Lama5 Trap homozygotes exhibit phenotypes identical to those observed in the original targeted knockout. 5J. H. Miner, unpublished data. In addition, because the fusion protein is expressed under the control of endogenous Lama5 regulatory sequences, staining with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) can be used to assay which cells express Lama5 (33Yin Y. Kikkawa Y. Mudd J.L. Skarnes W.C. Sanes J.R. Miner J.H. Genesis. 2003; 36: 114-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Preparation of Tissue Sections and Immunohistochemistry—E12.5, E13.5, E14.5, and E17.5 heads were dissected out and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline overnight at 4 °C. Tissues were embedded into OCT compound (Sakura Finetechnical Co.) for frozen sectioning or dehydrated into xylene through a graded ethanol series and embedded in Paraplast paraffin (Oxford Laboratories). Sections were cut at 8 μm by a cryostat (2800 Frigocut, Leica, Inc.) for frozen sections and at 10 μm on microtome (RM2155, Leica, Inc.) for paraffin sections. For morphological analysis of molars and incisors, sections were stained with Harris hematoxylin (Sigma) and eosin Y (Sigma). LacZ staining for E13.5 heterozygous and homozygous heads was performed as described previously (36Tsumaki N. Kimura T. Tanaka K. Kimura J.H. Ochi T. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22861-22864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemistry was performed on sections that were incubated in 1% bovine serum albumin/phosphate-buffered saline for blocking for 1 h and incubated with primary antibody. We used antibodies to collagen IV, integrin α3 (6B3), integrin α6 (GoH3), integrin β1 (9EG7), integrin β4 (346-11A), and PCNA. Primary antibodies were detected by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch) for integrins or Histomouse immunostaining kit (Zymed Laboratory, Inc.) for collagen IV and PCNA. Tissue and cell samples of immunohistochemistry were examined under a fluorescence microscope and confocal microscope (Zeiss). Images were recorded and imported into Metamorph 4.5 and NIH Image 1.6 software. In Situ Hybridization—In situ hybridization was performed on paraffin sections of E14.5 molars with the SureSite II system (Novagen). Shh and Fgf-4 cDNA for the RNA probe were gifts from Lillian Shum (NIH). Lef-1 cDNA (465 bp) was prepared by reverse transcription-PCR using RNA from E15 mouse molar tooth germ with Lef-1 primers, 5′-CCCATCCTCACTGTCAGGCGACAC-3′ and 5′-CCTGTACCTGAAGTCGACTCC-3′, and cloned into the pCR4-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). The Lef-1 cDNA was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The Lef-1 cDNA plasmid were digested by NotI for antisense probe and PstI for sense probe, and then cRNAs were synthesized by T3 RNA polymerase for antisense and T7 RNA polymerase for sense probes. [33P]UTP-labeled RNA probes were prepared according to the manufacturer’s instructions for the SureSite II system. The labeled transcripts were alkaline hydrolyzed to 150–200 nucleotides and used for hybridization. Dental Epithelial Cell Culture—Molars from E13.5 or E14.5 mouse embryos were dissected, and dental epithelial cells were prepared and cultured as described previously (20Fukumoto S. Kiba T. Hall B. Iehara N. Nakamura T. Longenecker G. Krebsbach P.H. Nanci A. Kulkarni A.B. Yamada Y. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 973-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Briefly, molars were treated with 0.1% collagenase, 0.05% trypsin, and 0.5 mm EDTA for 10 min, and the dental epithelium was separated from the dental mesenchyme. The dental epithelium was treated further with 0.1% collagenase, 0.05% trypsin, and 0.5 mm EDTA for 15 min, and then pipetted up and down well. Cells were cultured in keratinocyte-SFM medium supplemented with epidermal growth factor, bovine pituitary extract, 50 μg/ml penicillin G, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). To remove mesenchymal cells, cells were cultured in this medium for 7 days. During the culture, the medium was changed every 2 days. Cell Proliferation Assays—Dental epithelial cells were cultured at 1.0 × 105 cells/a 60-mm diameter dish coated with laminin-1 (Invitrogen), laminin-2 (Invitrogen), laminin-10/11 (Invitrogen), type I collagen (Cellmatrix, NITTA GERATIN, Japan), or fibronectin (Invitrogen) for 3 days. The cell proliferation assays were performed by incorporation of 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) using the BrdUrd labeling and detection kit (Roche Applied Science). Three days after culturing on each substrate, the cells were incubated with 10 μm BrdUrd and 10% fetal bovine serum for 1 h. The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and phosphate-buffered saline and permeabilized by 0.5% Triton X-100. The cells were incubated with 1% bovine serum albumin and Tris-buffered saline for 1 h and then with anti-BrdUrd antibody. Anti-BrdUrd antibodies were visualized by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody. Nuclear staining was performed with DAPI. Cell Spreading and Filopodia-like Microspike Formation—Approximately 1 × 104 cells were plated onto glass coverslips coated with laminin-1 or laminin-10/11 and allowed to spread for 1, 3, and 12 h at 37 °C in keratinocyte-SFM medium. To determine whether cell spreading and filopodia-like microspike formation on laminin-10/11 were dependent on integrins, cells were preincubated with 10 μg/ml inhibitory antibodies against integrin α6 (GoH3), integrin α3 (6B3), integrin β1 (HMβ1–1) and integrin β4 (346-11A), and several kinase inhibitors: wortmannin (20 nm), LY294002 (20 μm), PP1 (20 μm), PP2 (20 μm), herbimycin (0.5 μg/ml), PD98059 (50 μm), SB203580 (50 μm) for 30 min. Then cells were fixed as described above and stained with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin for F-actin. Preliminary studies indicated that round cells that have not begun to spread have cell areas <400 μm2 and microspikes <2 μm. Hence, we define those cells with areas >400 μm2 as spread, cell areas <400 μm2 as not spread, and those cells with >2 μm microspikes as filopodia-positive cells. DNA Transfection—For transfection, primary dental epithelial cells with ∼80% confluence on glass coverslips in 24-well culture plates were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 1-μg expression vectors for AU-5-tagged attached active and dominant negative forms of RhoA (pcEF/RhoQL and pcEF/RhoN19), Rac1 (pcEF/RacQL and pcEF/RacN17), and Cdc42 (pcEF/Cdc42QL and pcEF/Cdc42N17) were used. These plasmids were gifts from Silvio Gutkind (NIH). After a 3-h incubation with transfection reagents, cells were washed with keratinocyte-SFM medium, cultured for 2 days on a medium containing epidermal growth factor and bovine pituitary extract, and then used for analysis of cell spreading and filopodia-like microspike formation. Organ Culture—Initiation stage (E12.5), bud stage (E13.5), and early cap stage (E14.5) tooth germs of mandibular first molars were dissected out from ICR mice and cultured for periods of up 7 days using chemically defined medium in a modification of Trowell’s system (37Yamada M.

The explants were cultured using BGJb medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 100 μg/ml ascorbic acid, 10% fetal bovine serum, and penicillin-streptomycin on a filter (Millipore) in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. The medium was changed every 2 days. Defects in Tooth Germ Development of Lama5 Knock-out Mice—Two different lines of Lama5 mutant mice (13Miner J.H. Cunningham J. Sanes J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1713-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 33Yin Y. Kikkawa Y. Mudd J.L. Skarnes W.C. Sanes J.R. Miner J.H. Genesis. 2003; 36: 114-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) were used. Using Lama5 Trap mice, which express the βgeo gene (lacz/neo) under the control of the endogenous Lama5 promoter, we found that Lama5 was expressed specifically in the dental epithelium, but it did not appear in the dental mesenchyme (supplemental Fig. 1), agreeing with a previous report (17Salmivirta K. Sorokin L.M. Ekblom P. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 210: 206-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We next analyzed abnormalities of tooth germ development in E12.5–E17.5 embryos by hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunostaining for type IV collagen, the major basement membrane collagen. In E12.5 (initiation stage) and E13.5 (bud stage) heterozygous mice, the oral ectoderm thickens and invaginates into the ectomesenchyme (Fig. 1A, a and c). During these stages, the epithelium forms a single cell layer of the inner and outer epithelium, which surrounds multilayer dental epithelial cells including the stratum intermedium and stellate reticulum. However, in mutant mice, formation of a distinct single cell layer of the dental epithelium was not observed (Fig. 1A, b and d). In E14.5 control tooth germ (cap stage), the structure of the enamel knot, which determines the tooth shape including cusp, starts to form in the middle of the inner epithelium layer (Fig. 1Ae). In contrast, in mutant mice, such a structure is not formed, and the size of tooth germ is significantly smaller than control (Fig. 1Af). However, type IV collagen is immunostained on the basal laminar of the dental epithelium similar to that of control mice, indicating that the basement membrane is formed in mutant tooth germ despite the absence of the laminin α5 chain (Fig. 1A, g and h). At E17.5 control tooth germ (bell stage), cusps form, and the inner dental epithelial layer expands. At this stage, the inner dental epithelium of control mice is polarized, forms an elongated shape, and starts to synthesize enamel matrix proteins essential for enamel formation after birth (Fig. 1B, a and b). In mutant mice, the inner dental epithelium is not polarized and remains in a round shape (Fig. 1B, d and e). In addition, the basement membrane is discontinuous and disintegrated in some portions in the inner dental epithelium, but not the outer dental epithelial region (Fig. 2Bf). This is in contrast to the presence of a continuous smooth layer of the basement membrane surrounding the inner and outer dental epithelium in control mice (Fig. 1Bc).FIGURE 2In situ hybridization of Fgf-4, Shh, and Lef-1. Expression of Fgf-4 (a and b), Shh (c and d), and Lef-1 mRNA (e and f) in cap stage (E14.5) molar of heterozygote (a, c, and e) and mutant mice (b, d, and f) was analyzed by in situ hybridization. Fgf-4 (a) and Shh (c) are strongly expressed by epithelium in the enamel knot region of heterozygotes (a and c), whereas in mutants, the expression levels of these genes are significantly reduced (c and d). In contrast, Lef-1 mRNA expression is observed in the enamel knot region and its surrounding mesenchyme in both control and mutant mice (e and f).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Shh and Fgf-4 Expression and Cell Proliferation of Dental Epithelium—It has been suggested that tooth shape is regulated in part by signaling molecules from the enamel knots (40Vaahtokari A. Aberg T. Jernvall J. Keranen S. Thesleff I. Mech. Dev. 1996; 54: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). To examine the mechanism involved in the abnormal tooth morphogenesis observed in Lama5 knock-out mice, we performed in situ hybridization for Fgf-4, Shh, and Lef-1. Expression of Fgf-4 and Shh mRNA was localized in the enamel knot in heterozygous mice (Fig. 2). In mutant mice, mRNA expression levels of these genes were significantly reduced (Fig. 2). In contrast, Lef-1 was expressed in the enamel knot and its surrounding dental mesenchyme in both heterozygous and mutant mice (Fig. 2). Because Shh and Fgf-4 are known to promote cell proliferation, we examined cell proliferation in E14.5 tooth germ by PCNA staining (Fig. 3). In wild-type mice, the inner and outer epithelia and surrounding mesenchyme cells are positive for PCNA, indicating that these cells are prolif"
https://openalex.org/W2146283921,"Overexpression of GLUT4 exclusively in skeletal muscle enhances insulin action and improves glucose homeostasis. Transgenic studies have discovered two regions on the GLUT4 promoter conserved across several species that are required for normal GLUT4 expression in skeletal muscle. These regions contain binding motifs for the myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) family and GLUT4 enhancer factor (GEF). A single bout of exercise increases both GLUT4 transcription and mRNA abundance; however, the molecular mechanisms mediating this response remain largely unexplored. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine whether a single, acute bout of exercise increased the DNA-binding activities of MEF2 and GEF in human skeletal muscle. Seven subjects performed 60 min of cycling at approximately 70% of VO2peak. After exercise, the DNA-binding activities of both the MEF2A/D heterodimer and GEF were increased (P<0.05). There was no change in nuclear MEF2D or GEF abundance after exercise, but nuclear MEF2A abundance was increased (P<0.05). These data demonstrate that exercise increases MEF2 and GEF DNA binding and imply that these transcription factors could be potential targets for modulating GLUT4 expression in human skeletal muscle."
https://openalex.org/W2116320003,"Circadian clocks consist of transcriptional feedback loops housed in interdependent pacemaker neurons. Yet little is known about the neuronal output components essential for rhythmic behavior. Drosophila mutants of a putative ion channel, narrow abdomen (na), exhibit poor circadian rhythms and suppressed daylight activity. We find that NA is expressed in pacemaker neurons and induced expression within circadian neurons is sufficient to rescue these mutant phenotypes. Selective na rescue in distinct pacemaker neurons influences rhythmicity and timing of behavior. Oscillations of the clock protein PERIOD are intact in na mutants, indicating an output role. Pore residues are required for robust rescue consistent with NA action as an ion channel. In na mutants, expression of potassium currents and the key neuropeptide PDF are elevated, the latter consistent with reduced release. These data implicate NA and the pacemaker neural network in controlling phase and rhythmicity."

Overall, relaxin-3 adopts an insulin-like fold, but the structure differs crucially from the crystal structure of human relaxin-2 near the B-chain terminus. In particular, the B-chain C terminus folds back, allowing TrpB27 to interact with the hydrophobic core. This interaction partly blocks the conserved RXXXRXXI motif identified as a determinant for the interaction with the relaxin receptor LGR7 and may account for the lower affinity of relaxin-3 relative to relaxin for this receptor.

BMC Evolutionary Biology. 2005; http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/14PubMed Google Scholar), and RLN3 genes have been identified in all mammalian genomes as well as in the genomes of chicken, frog, and various fish species. In contrast, the RLN1 gene is found only in mammals. Fig. 1 shows a sequence comparison of the product of the human RLN3 gene, human relaxin-3 (H3 relaxin); H2 and H1 relaxins; and relaxin-3 orthologs from other species. Interestingly, the relaxin-3 sequences are highly conserved between species, in contrast to relaxin, which shows considerable sequence variation. Relaxin has long been regarded as a hormone mainly associated with pregnancy. Produced in the corpus luteum and/or placenta of most mammals, it has numerous pregnancy-specific actions, including the remodeling of the reproductive tract and preparation of the mammary apparatus for lactation (6Sherwood O.D. The Physiology of Reproduction.in: Knobil E. Neill J.D. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 861-1009Google Scholar). However, relaxin also has important physiological roles outside of pregnancy. It inhibits collagen biosynthesis and promotes collagen breakdown (7Williams E.J. Benyon R.C. Trim N. Hadwin R. Grove B.H. Arthur M.J. Unemori E.N. Iredale J.P.

Pharmacol. 1997; 28: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the expression pattern of relaxin-3 differs significantly from that of relaxin, suggesting a distinctly different physiological role. The highest expression of relaxin-3 in all species examined to date, including humans, is in the brain. In rats (11Burazin T.C. Bathgate R.A.D. Macris M. Layfield S. Gundlach A.L. Tregear G.W. J. Neurochem. 2002; 82: 1553-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) and mice (1Bathgate R.A.D. Samuel C.S. Burazin T.C. Layfield S. Claasz A.A. Reytomas I.G. Dawson N.F. Zhao C. Bond C.

Chem. 2002; 277: 1148-1157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), the expression is localized to a specific region of the dorsal tegmental region of the pons called the nucleus incertus. Anatomical studies suggest that this nucleus is involved in a midbrain behavior control network that influences circuits regulating locomotion, attention, and learning processes and that responds to stress-related neuroendocrine signals (12Goto M. Swanson L.W. Canteras N.S. J. Comp. Neurol. 2001; 438: 86-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Mapping studies have demonstrated that relaxin-3-immunoreactive nerve fibers emanating from the nucleus incertus innervate numerous regions of the brain, suggesting that the nucleus incertus utilizes relaxin-3 as a neurotransmitter (13Tanaka M. Iijima N. Miyamoto Y. Fukusumi S. Itoh Y. Ozawa H. Ibata Y. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2005; 21: 1659-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). These data, coupled with the remarkable conservation of the relaxin-3 peptide from fish to humans, suggest that relaxin-3 has highly important, but presently unknown, central actions. Indeed, a very recent study suggests that relaxin-3 is involved in appetite regulation (14McGowan B.M. Stanley S.A. Smith K.L. White N.E. Connolly M.M. Thompson E.L. Gardiner J.V. Murphy K.G. Ghatei M.A. Bloom S.R. Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 3295-3300Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), and another study has demonstrated that relaxin-3 mRNA production is increased in response to water-restraint stress (13Tanaka M. Iijima N. Miyamoto Y. Fukusumi S. Itoh Y. Ozawa H. Ibata Y. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2005; 21: 1659-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), suggesting a role in the stress response. Members of the relaxin family are structurally similar to insulin, comprising two peptide chains that are linked by two disulfide bonds, with the A-chain containing a third, intrachain disulfide bond. However, unlike insulin, whose receptor is a tyrosine kinase, members of the relaxin peptide family bind to G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). 2The abbreviations used are: GPCRs, G-protein-coupled receptors; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect. The first receptors identified responding to relaxin stimuli were the leucine-rich repeat-containing GPCRs LGR7 and LGR8 (2Hsu S.Y. Nakabayashi K. Nishi S. Kumagai J. Kudo M. Sherwood O.D. Hsueh A.J. Science. 2002; 295: 671-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar), which both have low nanomolar affinity for relaxin and which are capable of mediating the actions of relaxin through a cAMP-dependent pathway (2Hsu S.Y. Nakabayashi K. Nishi S. Kumagai J. Kudo M. Sherwood O.D. Hsueh A.J. Science. 2002; 295: 671-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). Interestingly, relaxin-3 also activates LGR7, albeit with a lower affinity than relaxin, but has a significantly reduced affinity for LGR8 (15Sudo S. Kumagai J. Nishi S. Layfield S. Ferraro T. Bathgate R.A.D. Hsueh A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7855-7862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Recent work has identified two additional orphan GPCRs, GPCR135 and GPCR142, which also respond to relaxin-3 activation (16Liu C. Eriste E. Sutton S. Chen J. Roland B. Kuei C. Farmer N. Jornvall H. Sillard R. Lovenberg T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50754-50764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 17Liu C. Chen J. Sutton S. Roland B. Kuei C. Farmer N. Sillard R. Lovenberg T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50765-50770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). On the basis of the higher affinity of relaxin-3 for GPCR135 and their coexpression in regions of the brain, it was concluded that relaxin-3 is the endogenous ligand for GPCR135, whereas the primary ligands for LGR8 and GPCR142 are two other members of the relaxin peptide family, INSL3 (insulin-like peptide-3 or Leydig insulin-like peptide) (18Kumagai J. Hsu S.Y. Matsumi H. Roh J.S. Fu P. Wade J.D. Bathgate R.A.D. Hsueh A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31283-31286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) and INSL5 (insulin-like peptide-5) (19Liu C. Kuei C. Sutton S. Chen J. Bonaventure P. Wu J. Nepomuceno D. Kamme F. Tran D.T. Zhu J. Wilkinson T. Bathgate R. Eriste E. Sillard R. Lovenberg T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 292-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), respectively. The cross-reactivity of these hormone-receptor signaling systems has raised questions about which factors are responsible for the selectivity of these ligand-receptor pairings. Moreover, as relaxin-3, GPCR135, and LGR7 are all expressed in the brain, understanding the significance of the interaction of relaxin-3 with LGR7 will be crucial in determining its function. In this study, we provide a crucial piece of the puzzle by presenting the solution structure of the human form of the most recently discovered member of this hormone family, relaxin-3. The structure reveals a relaxin/insulin fold, but with an unusual conformation of the C-terminal region of the B-chain. The structural data provide insights into the receptor specificities of this new member of the relaxin peptide family. Peptide Synthesis—The A- and B-chains were assembled as C-terminal peptide acids or amides by Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) solid-phase synthesis on a hydroxymethylphenoxyacetyl- or 5-(4-aminomethyl-3,5-dimethoxyphenoxy)valeryl-polyethylene glycol/polystyrene support using the following selective cysteine S-protection: Cys A10/A15 trityl; CysA11/B11, acetamidomethyl; CysA24, t-butyl; and CysB22, trityl. Following conventional trifluoroacetic acid cleavage in the presence of scavengers, the intramolecular disulfide bond of the A-chain was formed by aeration, and CysA24 (t-butyl) was displaced with S-pyridinyl by reaction with 2,2′-dipyridyl disulfide in trifluoromethanesulfonic acid. Combination of the peptide with the B-chain occurred by thiolysis, after which the third and final disulfide bond between A11 and B10 was formed by iodolysis. The purity of the peptide was confirmed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (for example, peptide acid: theory, 5500.5; and found, 5499.6) and analytical reversed-phase HPLC. Biological Activity Assays—H3 relaxin acid and amide were tested for their ability to activate LGR7, LGR8, and GPCR135. Stably transfected human embryonic kidney 293T cells expressing human LGR7 or LGR8 (15Sudo S. Kumagai J. Nishi S. Layfield S. Ferraro T. Bathgate R.A.D. Hsueh A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7855-7862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) and Chinese hamster ovary K1 cells stably expressing human GPCR135 (20van der Westhuizen E.T. Sexton P.M. Bathgate R.A.D. Summers R.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2005; 1041: 332-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) were stimulated for 30 min with various concentrations of H3 relaxin acid or amide. LGR7 and LGR8 were tested in parallel with H2 relaxin and human INSL3, respectively (both at 100 nm), and GPCR135 with forskolin (5 μm) to determine maximum cellular cAMP response. cAMP accumulation was measured in cell lysates as described previously (15Sudo S. Kumagai J. Nishi S. Layfield S. Ferraro T. Bathgate R.A.D. Hsueh A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7855-7862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). NMR Spectroscopy—Pulsed-field gradient NMR diffusion experiments were performed with a two-dimensional sequence using stimulated echo longitudinal encode-decode (21Altieri A.S. Hinton D.P. Byrd R.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 7566-7567Crossref Scopus (442) Google Scholar). The lengths of all pulses and delays were held constant, and 32 spectra were acquired with the strength of the diffusion gradient varying between 2 and 95% of its maximum value. The lengths of the diffusion gradient and the stimulated echo were optimized for each sample to give a total decay in the protein signal of ∼90%. Dioxane was added to the samples to a final concentration of 0.2 mm and used as an internal standard (22Wilkins D.K. Grimshaw S.B. Receveur V. Dobson C.M. Jones J.A. Smith L.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16424-16431Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). Samples prepared for structure determination contained ∼1 mm peptide dissolved in 90% H2O and 10 or 100% (v/v) D2O at pH 3.0. Spectra were recorded at 290, 298, and 303 K on a Bruker Avance 600-MHz spectrometer or on a Bruker DMX 750-MHz spectrometer. Two-dimensional experiments recorded included double-quantum filtered COSY; total correlation spectroscopy using an MLEV-17 spin lock sequence with a mixing time of 80 ms; and nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) correlation spectroscopy with mixing times of 100, 150, and 200 ms. Spectra were generally acquired with 4096 complex data points in F2 and 512 increments in the F1 dimension over a spectral width of 14 ppm. Slowly exchanging NH protons were detected by acquiring a series of one-dimensional and total correlation spectra of the fully protonated peptide immediately after dissolution in D2O. As most amides disappeared within the first 2 h, resonances still visible after 2 h were considered to be protected from the solvent by hydrogen bonding. Spectra were processed on a Silicon Graphics Octane workstation using XWIN-NMR (Bruker BioSpin Corp.). The F1 dimension was generally zero-filled to 1024 real data points, and 90° phase-shifted sine bell window functions were applied before Fourier transformation. Chemical shifts were referenced to 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentanesulfonic acid at 0.00 ppm. Distance restraints were derived primarily from a 100-ms NOE correlation spectrum recorded at 298 K and 600 MHz. Cross-peaks were assigned and integrated in XEASY and converted to distance restraints using CYANA. Distance restraints for cross-peaks that could not be unambiguously assigned were introduced into structure calculations as ambiguous restraints. Backbone dihedral restraints were inferred from 3JNH-Hα coupling constants. Because of the generally broad lines of many amide protons, coupling constants were, in some cases, estimated from a combination of apparent coupling constants, peak intensities, and consistency with preliminary structures. The dihedral angle φ was restrained to -120 ± 40° for 3JNH-Hα > 8 Hz and to -60 ± 30° for 3JNH-Hα < 5 Hz. Additional φ angle restraints of -100 ± 80° were included where a positive angle could be excluded based on a strong sequential Hαi-1-HNi NOE compared with the intraresidue Hαi-HNi NOE. Side chain χ1 angles and stereospecific assignments were determined on the basis of observed NOE and 3JHα-Hβ coupling patterns. For a predicted t2 g3 side chain conformation, the χ1 were restrained to -60 ± 30°(TrpA13residues,GluA19, CysA24, ArgB8, LeuB9, CysB10, and CysB22); and for a g2t3 conformation, the angles were constrained to 180 ± 30° (residues LysA12, LysA17, LeuA23, PheB14, and ArgB26). No residues could be confirmed to be in the g2 g3 conformation based on experimental data. Additional stereospecific assignments of the methyl groups for ValB18 and LeuA23 were determined based on their NOE patterns. Hydrogen bonds were included in the structure calculations for all amide protons concluded to be slowly exchanging only after a suitable acceptor could be identified in the preliminary structures. In all cases, these hydrogen bonds were found between the backbone atoms within the elements of secondary structure. Three-dimensional structures were calculated using simulated annealing and energy minimization protocols from ARIA (23Linge J.P. Nilges M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) in the program CNS (24Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). The protocol involves a high temperature phase with 4000 steps of 0.015 ps of torsion angle dynamics; a cooling phase with 4000 steps of 0.015 ps of torsion angle dynamics during which the temperature is lowered to 0 K; and finally, an energy minimization phase with 5000 steps of Powell minimization. The refinement in explicit water involves the following steps: heating to 500 K via steps of 100 K, each with 50 steps of 0.005 ps of Cartesian dynamics; 2500 steps of 0.005 ps of Cartesian dynamics at 500 K; and a cooling phase in which the temperature is lowered in steps of 100 K, each with 2500 steps of 0.005 ps of Cartesian dynamics. Finally, the structures were minimized with 2000 steps of Powell minimization. Protein structures were analyzed using PROMOTIF and PRO-CHECK and displayed using MOLMOL. Ramachandran analysis showed that 83% of the residues are in the most favored regions, with the remaining in the additionally allowed (15%) and generously allowed (2%). The coordinates representing the solution structure of H3 relaxin and the experimental restraints have been submitted to the Protein Data Bank (Code 2FHW). Peptide Synthesis—H3 relaxin was prepared as both its C-terminal acid and amide forms by solid-phase peptide synthesis of the separate A- and B-chains together with regioselective disulfide bond formation (25Lin F. Otvos Jr., L. Kumagai J. Tregear G.W. Bathgate R.A.D. Wade J.D. J. Pept. Sci. 2004; 10: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Chemical characterization by reversed-phase HPLC and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry confirmed the homogeneity of the products. Tryptic mapping followed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry showed that the disulfide bonds were in the correct insulin-like pairings. Biological Activity—H3 relaxin acid was tested for its ability to stimulate human LGR7, LGR8, and GPCR135 in parallel with the H3 relaxin amide peptide. As shown in Fig. 2, the activities of the peptides were identical. In LGR7-expressing cells, both peptides stimulated cAMP accumulation to levels similar to those achieved with H2 relaxin (H3 relaxin acid pEC50 = 8.08 ± 0.07 (n = 4) and H3 relaxin amide pEC50 = 8.19 ± 0.078 (n = 3)). In GPCR135-expressing cells, both peptides decreased forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation (H3 relaxin acid pEC50 = 9.30 ± 0.082 (n = 3) and H3 relaxin amide pEC50 = 9.25 ± 0.092 (n = 3)). Both peptides were unable to stimulate cAMP accumulation in LGR8-expressing cells at concentrations up to 1 μm (data not shown). NMR Diffusion Measurements—In light of the tendency of members of the insulin superfamily to aggregate, including H2 relaxin and insulin, it was important to establish whether any multimers of H3 relaxin were present under the conditions used for the NMR studies. This was assessed by measuring translational diffusion using pulsed-field gradient experiments with dioxane (hydrodynamic radius of 2.12 Å) as an internal standard. No significant difference in the hydrodynamic radius of H3 relaxin was observed between concentrations of 0.1 and 1 mm (14.2 and 14.4Å,respectively), indicating that there was no concentration-dependent aggregation. On the basis of the equation derived by Wilkins et al. (22Wilkins D.K. Grimshaw S.B. Receveur V. Dobson C.M. Jones J.A. Smith L.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16424-16431Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar) (Rh = (4.75 ± 1.11)N0.29±0.02, where N is the number of residues in the protein and Rh is the hydrodynamic radius in Angstroms), the expected values for a H3 relaxin monomer (51 residues) and a H3 relaxin dimer (102 residues) would be ∼14.8 and ∼18.2 Å, respectively, confirming that H3 relaxin is monomeric under the conditions used for these studies. NMR Assignments and Structure Determination of H3 Relaxin—For the structural analysis of H3 relaxin, extensive two-dimensional NMR spectral data were recorded at 600 and 750 MHz on a sample containing ∼1 mm peptide. The spectral data were of high quality with excellent signal dispersion indicative of a well structured peptide. Resonance assignments were achieved using two-dimensional sequential assignment strategies, which, after analysis of spectra of both the H3 relaxin acid and amide forms at several temperatures, resulted in complete assignments for the peptide backbone and nearly complete assignment for side chain resonances. Interestingly, a number of residues showed broad lines; and in particular, significant line broadening was observed for a set of resonances, including SerA7, CysA10, CysA11, ArgA12, TrpA13, GlyA14, CysA15, CysB10, and PheB14, suggesting that conformational exchange is present in this region of the molecule. This exchange is present in this region of the molecule. This exchange is likely a result of a pro-R/pro-S disulfide bonds. In addition, several weak spin systems arising from a minor conformation were identified. These resonances were found correspond to the N-terminal region of the B-chain, i.e. AlaB2, AlaB3, ProB4, and TyrB5, and analysis of NOEs revealed that they were the result of a cis/trans-isomerization of ProB4. The trans-conformation is the major isomer (∼90%), with the cis-conformation corresponding to a minor conformation (∼10%), as evident from strong sequential Hαi-1-Hδi and Hαi-1-Hαi NOEs, respectively. The structural restraints derived from the NMR data and used for structure calculations were based exclusively on data recorded for the native acid form and included interproton distances, backbone and side chain dihedral angles derived from coupling constants, and restraints for hydrogen bonds deduced from amide exchange experiments. Structures were calculated by simulated annealing followed by refinement and energy minimization in explicit solvent (H2O). Distance restraints were derived from intensities of NOE cross-peaks in an NOE correlation spectrum recorded at 298 K with a mixing time of 100 ms. As expected for a 51-amino acid peptide, a number of cross-peaks were ambiguous at the first stage of the assignment due to degeneracy of chemical shifts, in particular in the methyl region. These ambiguities were resolved using an iterative approach in which preliminary structures were used to guide the assignments and by inclusion of ambiguous restraints. Hydrogen bonds were inferred from amide exchange behavior and introduced into the structure calculations once the preliminary structures indicated a suitable acceptor, which in all cases were found to be within elements of secondary structure. Description of the Three-dimensional Structure of H3 Relaxin—A summary of the NMR data, including sequential and medium-range NOEs, coupling constants, hydrogen exchange, and secondary Hα shifts, is presented in Fig. 3. These data provide a good indication of the presence of secondary structure, as both helical and extended conformations have typical “fingerprints.” Helices are generally characterized by a large number of medium-range NOE contacts, small 3JHα-HN coupling constants, and negative secondary shifts, whereas β-sheets display large 3JHα-HN coupling constants and positive secondary shifts. The exchange rates between the backbone amide protons and the solvent can be measured by recording the decay in signal after dissolution of the peptide in D2O and provide information about the presence of hydrogen bonds, as amide protons involved in hydrogen bonds are protected from the solvent and display a slow exchange behavior. Although most amides in H3 relaxin exchange in minutes, a number are still visible >2 h after dissolution in D2O, and these could in all cases be correlated to hydrogen bonds in the structure. Fig. 4 shows a superposition of a family of 20 low energy structures representing the solution structure of H3 relaxin. Overall, the structure is well defined, with the exception of the N terminus of the B-chain, which is disordered and likely flexible in solution. The energetic and structural statistics for the structural family are summarized in Table 1. All structures have good energies and covalent geometry as evident from small deviations from ideal bond lengths and angles and the Ramachandran analysis, which showed that 83% of all non-Gly/Pro residues are in the most favored regions and that the remaining residues, all of which are in the more flexible regions of the peptide, are in the additionally allowed regions. It is clear that H3 relaxin adopts a typical relaxin/insulin fold, with the A-chain containing two α-helices (residues A1-A13 and A17-A24) separated by a short β-strand (residues A15-A17) and the B-chain containing a second β-strand (residues B5-B7) and an α-helix (residues B12-B22). The A-chain helices lie parallel to each other, forming a U-shaped arrangement. The B-chain helix is placed across the face of the U, roughly perpendicular to the axes of the A-chain helices. Enclosed between them is a significant hydrophobic core involving the side chains of, LeuA3, LeuA6, IleA20, LeuA23, CysA10, CysA15, LeuB9, CsyB10, PheB14, IleB15, ValB18, IleB19 and TrpB27. The observation that the Trp side chain interacts with the hydrophobic core as evident from a large number of NOEs to CysA24, CysB22, IleB15, ValB18, and IleB19 was surprising because, in the crystal structure of H2 relaxin, this region is disordered, and the Trp extends away from the core, being fully exposed to the solvent. The interaction appears to have become possible because of a shortening of the B-chain helix and a reversal of the peptide backbone due to turns formed by the B23-B26 (GGSR) segment.TABLE 1NMR and refinement statistics for protein structuresH3 relaxinNMR distance and dihedral constraintsDistance constraintsTotal inter-residue NOEs766Sequential (|i - j| = 1)311Medium-range (|i - j| < 4)213Long-range (|i - j| > 5)242Hydrogen bonds21Total dihedral angle restraintsΦ33ϰ116Structure statisticsViolations (mean ± S.D.)Distance constraints (>0.2 Å)0.4 ± 0.60Dihedral angle constraints (>2°)0Maximum distance constraint0.24violation (Å)Deviations from idealized geometryBond lengths (Å)0.00414 ± 0.00011Bond angles0.512 ± 0.017°Impropers0.412 ± 0.026°Average pairwise r.m.s.d.aPairwise root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) was calculated for 20 refined structures over residues A1-A24 and B3-B27.

Open table in a new tab Solution Structure of H3 Relaxin—In this study, we have determined the three-dimensional solution structure of H3 relaxin. H3 relaxin is well behaved in solution and adopts an insulin-like fold that is braced by the three disulfide bonds conserved throughout the family and that is characterized by three helical segments and a short double-stranded β-sheet. Although the structure is well defined overall, there is evidence for dynamic processes in several regions of the peptide. Most pronounced is the disorder at the N terminus of the B-chain, which is likely due to flexibility in this region. Supporting this suggestion is the observation of cis/trans-isomerization for ProB4, which results in two sets of resonances for the amino acids in this region. A similar isomerization has been observed in insulin (26Higgins K.A. Craik D.J. Hall J.G. Andrews P.R. Drug Des. Delivery. 1988; 3: 159-170Google Scholar), but there are no data suggesting that this feature is implicated in the biological function. More interesting is the observation of specific broadening of peaks from residues near the CysA10 -CysA15 and CysA11 -CysB10 disulfide bonds, with the extreme example"

Mice have two isoforms of sphingosine kinase type 1, SPHK1a and SPHK1b. In addition to the previously reported difference in their enzyme activities, we have found that these isoforms differ in several enzymatic characteristics. First, SPHK1b is unstable, whereas SPHK1a is highly stable. Degradation of SPHK1b occurs at the membrane and is inhibited by a proteasome inhibitor. Second, only SPHK1b exhibits abnormal mobility on SDS-PAGE, probably due to its SDS-resistant structure. Third, SPHK1a and SPHK1b are predominantly detected in the soluble and membrane fractions, respectively, when their degradation is inhibited. Fourth, only SPHK1b is modified with lipid, on its unique Cys residues (Cys-4 and Cys-5). Site-directed mutagenesis at these Cys residues resulted in increased sphingosine kinase activity, suggesting that the modification is inhibitory to the enzyme. Finally, SPHK1b tends to form homo-oligomers, whereas most SPHK1a is presented as monomers. We have also determined that the lipid modification of SPHK1b is involved in its homo-oligomerization. Thus, although these two proteins differ only in a few N-terminal amino acid residues, their enzymatic traits are extremely different.

The bioactive lipid molecule sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) 2The abbreviations used are: S1P, sphingosine 1-phosphate; HEK, human embryonic kidney; 3×FLAG, triple FLAG; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. regulates several cellular processes such as cell proliferation, cell migration, and differentiation through binding to its cell surface receptors, which are S1P/Edg family members (1.Pyne S.

In addition to its extracellular action, S1P is presumed to act intracellularly in Ca2+ mobilization, cell proliferation, and apoptosis inhibition (1.Pyne S. Pyne N.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 385-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar, 2.Spiegel S. Milstien S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 397-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1768) Google Scholar). S1P is abundant in blood (4.Yatomi Y. Igarashi Y. Yang L. Hisano N. Qi R. Asazuma N. Satoh K. Ozaki Y. Kume S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 121: 969-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar) and is physiologically important, especially in the vascular and immune systems (5.Hla T. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 513-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Its importance in the vascular system is evident in S1P1/Edg1-null mice, which die in utero with severe hemorrhage resulting from impaired vessel integrity due to a deficiency in smooth muscle cell recruitment (6.Liu Y.

Its influence in the immune system has been demonstrated using the synthetic immunosuppressant FTY720, which is phosphorylated in vivo and binds to S1P receptors (7.Brinkmann V. Davis M.D. Heise C.E.

S1P and the S1P1 receptor also have important functions in the egress of lymphocytes from lymphoid organs, and phosphorylated FTY720 induces the down-regulation of S1P1 on lymphocytes and inhibits their recirculation (9.Allende M.L.

Sphingosine kinases catalyze the production of S1P from sphingosine and are also responsible for the phosphorylation of FTY720 (11.Billich A. Bornancin F. Devay P. Mechtcheriakova D. Urtz N.

Although sphingosine kinases possess no apparent enzymatic motif or transmembrane domain, there are five regions, termed C1 to C5, that are conserved among sphingosine kinases (13.Kohama T.

Two mammalian sphingosine kinases are known, SPHK1, which was identified by purification of the enzyme and subsequent sequence determination (13.Kohama T. Olivera A. Edsall L. Nagiec M.M. Dickson R.

Intracellular S1P levels are regulated by a balance between synthesis by sphingosine kinase and degradation by either phosphohydrolase or lyase.

Although such regulation is involved in the stimuli-dependent activation of SPHK1, the precise molecular mechanisms that link the stimuli and the activation still remain largely unknown in most cases. Two isoforms for mouse SPHK1 have been reported, SPHK1a and SPHK1b (13.Kohama T. Olivera A. Edsall L. Nagiec M.M. Dickson R. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23722-23728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the activity of SPHK1b is significantly lower (30-200-fold) than that of SPHK1a (13.Kohama T. Olivera A. Edsall L. Nagiec M.M. Dickson R. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23722-23728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar), although these proteins differ only in a few amino acid residues in their N termini. In the present study we have demonstrated that SPHK1b does not accumulate within the cell due to its low stability. We also found that SPHK1b differs from SPHK1a in several enzymatic characteristics. These include structural resistance toward SDS, membrane localization, protein stability, post-translational modification, and oligomer formation. Thus, the N terminus plays an important role in the determination of the enzymatic properties of SPHK1. Cell Culture and Transfection—Mouse F9 embryonal carcinoma cells and human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (D6429; Sigma) containing 10% fetal calf serum and supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in 0.1% gelatin- and 0.3% collagen-coated dishes, respectively. Transfections were performed using Lipofectamine™ 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) for F9 cells and Lipofectamine Plus™ reagent (Invitrogen) for HEK 293T cells. Plasmids—The pCE-puro SPHK1a, pCE-puro SPHK1a2, and pCE-puro SPHK1b plasmids are derivatives of the pCE-puro vector (30.Kihara A. Ikeda M. Kariya Y. Lee E.Y. Lee Y.M. Igarashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14578-14585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and encode SPHK1a, SPHK1a2, and SPHK1b, respectively. The pCE-puro SPHK1a-3×FLAG, pCE-puro SPHK1b-3×FLAG, pCE-puro SPHK1a-Myc, and pCE-puro SPHK1b-Myc plasmids encode SPHK1 proteins tagged with triple FLAG (3×FLAG) or Myc epitopes at the C termini. The pCE-puro 3×FLAG-SPHK1a-Myc and pCE-puro 3×FLAG-SPHK1b-Myc plasmids encode SPHK1 proteins tagged with both 3×FLAG epitopes at their N termini and Myc epitopes at their C termini. The SPHK1a, SPHK1a2, and SPHK1b cDNAs were amplified by PCR using the pCE-puro HA-SPHK1a plasmid (30.Kihara A. Ikeda M. Kariya Y. Lee E.Y. Lee Y.M. Igarashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14578-14585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) as a template. The primers used included a common primer, 5′-GGTTTGTCCAAACTCATCAA-3′, a SPHK1a-specific primer, 5′-TGCCACCATGGAACCAGAATGCCCTCG-3′, a SPHK1a2-specific primer, 5′-GCCACCATGGAACCAGTAGAATGCCCTCGAGGACTGCTCCC-3′, and a SPHK1b-specific primer, 5′-CGATTAGCTTGCCACCATGTGGTGGTGTTGTGTTTTGTTTGTAGTAGAATGCCCTCGAGGACTG-3′. Each amplified fragment was first cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI), and the NotI-NotI fragment of the resulting plasmid was then cloned into the NotI site of the pCE-puro vector, generating the pCE-puro SPHK1a, pCE-puro SPHK1a2, or pCE-puro SPHK1b plasmid. The pCE-puro SPHK1b-C1, pCE-puro SPHK1b-C2, and pCE-puro SPHK1b-C1C2 plasmids were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) from the pCE-puro SPHK1b plasmid. The primers used are as follows: for pCE-puro SPHK1b-C1, 5′-GCTTGCCACCATGTGGTGGAGTTGTGTTTTGTTTGTAGTAG-3′ and 5′-CTACTACAAACAAAACACAACTCCACCACATGGTGGCAAGC-3′; for pCE-puro SPHK1b-C2, 5′-GCTTGCCACCATGTGGTGGTGTAGTGTTTTGTTTGTAGTAG-3′ and 5′-CTACTACAAACAAAACACTACACCACCACATGGTGGCAAGC-3′; for pCE-puro SPHK1b-C1C2, 5′-GCTTGCCACCATGTGGTGGAGTAGTGTTTTGTTTGTAGTAG-3′ and 5′-CTACTACAAACAAAACACTACTCCACCACATGGTGGCAAGC-3′. The pCE-puro SPHK1b-C1C2-3×FLAG plasmid was constructed by cloning a 0.48-kilobase EcoRI-SgrAI fragment of pCE-puro SPHK1b-C1C2 into the EcoRI-SgrAI site of pCE-puro SPHK1b-3×FLAG. The pCE-puro SPHK1b-C1C2-Myc plasmid was similarly constructed using pCE-puro SPHK1b-C1C2 and pCE-puro SPHK1b-Myc. The pCE-puro 3×FLAG-Ub plasmid, which encodes ubiquitin tagged with a 3×FLAG epitope at the N terminus, was constructed as follows. The ubiquitin cDNA was amplified from 17-day mouse embryo cDNA (BD Biosciences Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) using primers 5′-AGGATCCATGCAGATCTTTGTGAAGACCCTG-3′ and 5′-TTTAGCCACCTCTGAGGCGAAGGACCAGG-3′. The amplified fragment was cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector, creating the pGEM Ub plasmid. The pCE-puro 3×FLAG-Ub plasmid was constructed by cloning the 0.26-kilobase BamHI-NotI fragment of the pGEM Ub plasmid into the BamHI-NotI site of the pCE-puro 3×FLAG-1 vector, which had been designed to produce an N-terminal 3×FLAG tagged protein. Real-time Quantitative PCR—First-strand cDNAs from various mouse tissues and embryonic development stages were purchased from BD Biosciences Clontech (Mouse Multiple Tissue cDNA (MTC) panel I). Real-time quantitative PCR was performed using the first-strand cDNAs, Platinum Quantitative PCR SuperMix UDG (Invitrogen), and an ABI PRISM™ 7700 sequence detector (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). 6-Carboxyfluorescein (FAM)-labeled LUX™ primers (5′-CGAGGTATGGAACCAGAATGCCCT(FAM)G-3′ for SPHK1a and 5′-CTACAAATGGTGGTGTTGTGTTTTGTTTG(FAM)AG-3′ for SPHK1b) and the common unlabeled primer (5′-GCCTTGCCCTTGCCACCCTGGGG-3′) were used as primers. The expression level of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was examined using Certified LUX™ Primer Set (100 M-01; Invitrogen). Immunoblotting—Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (30.Kihara A. Ikeda M. Kariya Y. Lee E.Y. Lee Y.M. Igarashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14578-14585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Anti-SPHK1 (1/1000 dilution) (31.Fukuda Y. Kihara A. Igarashi Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 309: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), anti-FLAG M2 (1 μg/ml; Stratagene), anti-Myc PL14 (1 μg/ml; Medical & Biological Laboratories, Nagoya, Japan), anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (1 μg/ml; Ambion, Austin, TX), and anti-calnexin (H-10) antibodies (0.2 μg/ml; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) were used as primary antibodies. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG F(ab′)2 fragment (both from Amersham Biosciences and diluted 1:7500) were used as secondary antibodies. When immunoprecipitated proteins were subjected to immunoblotting with the same rabbit antibodies used for the immunoprecipitation, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit IgG TrueBlot™ (eBioscience, San Diego, CA), which does not react with SDS-denatured rabbit IgGs, was used as the secondary antibody. Labeling was detected using ECL™ Reagents or an ECL Plus system for Western blotting detection (both from Amersham Biosciences). Immunofluorescence Microscopy —Microscopic immunofluorescence analysis was performed as described previously (32.Ogawa C. Kihara A. Gokoh M. Igarashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1268-1272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) with affinity-purified anti-SPHK1 antibodies (1:100) and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L)-conjugated antibody (5 μg/ml, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The stained cells were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy (Axioskop 2 PLUS; Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Pulse-Chase and Immunoprecipitation —HEK 293T cells were transfected with the pCE-puro SPHK1a, pCE-puro SPHK1b, or pCE-puro SPHK1b-C1C2 plasmid. Eighteen h after transfection, the cell layer was disrupted by a trypsin/EDTA solution, and the cell suspension was divided into 4 or 5 aliquots. Each aliquot was added to a new 30-mm culture dish and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Culture medium was then changed to 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without Met/Cys (D0422, Sigma) and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]Met/[35S]Cys (22 μCi/dish EXPRESS™ protein labeling mix; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 20 min and chased with unlabeled Met (final concentration 0.5 mg/ml) and Cys (final concentration 0.1 mg/ml) in 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (D6429) containing 10% fetal calf serum. At predetermined times cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), treated with 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Complete™ EDTA free; Roche Diagnostics)), and kept on ice. Cells were disrupted by 5 passages through a 21-gauge needle, and debris was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Cell lysates with equal radioactivity were incubated with affinity-purified anti-SPHK1 antibodies and protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C for 14 h. After 2 washes with 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and 1 with 1 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), beads were suspended in 2× SDS sample buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, and a trace amount of bromphenol blue) containing 10% 2-mercaptoethanol and boiled for 3 min. The precipitates were then separated by SDS-PAGE. Radioactivities associated with SPHK1 were quantified using a Bio-Imaging Analyzer BAS2500 (Fuji Photo Film, Tokyo, Japan). For detection of SPHK1-ubiquitin conjugations, HEK 293T cells were transfected with pCE-puro 3×FLAG-Ub and either pCE-puro SPHK1a or pCE-puro SPHK1b, then incubated for 40 h at 37 °C. Preparation of cell lysates and immunoprecipitation with anti-SPHK1 antibodies were performed as described above. Precipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblotting using an anti-FLAG M2 antibody. To detect homo-oligomer formation of SPHK1, HEK 293T cells were transfected with two plasmids, one carrying 3×FLAG-tagged SPHK1 genes and the other harboring Myc-tagged SPHK1 genes. Twenty-two hours after transfection, 20 μm MG132 was added to inhibit the proteasome-dependent SPHK1 degradation, and the cells were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. The cells were washed twice with PBS, suspended in buffer A (PBS, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1× protease inhibitor mixture, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and sonicated. After a centrifugation at 300 × g for 3 min at 4 °C, the resulting supernatant was treated with 1% Triton X-100 for 30 min at 4 °C. Samples were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was incubated with an M2 affinity gel (Sigma) for 2 h at 4°C. The gel was washed 3 times with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, suspended in 2× SDS sample buffer, and boiled. The obtained precipitates were treated with 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, boiled for 3 min, separated by SDS-PAGE, and subjected to immunoblotting with an anti-FLAG M2 antibody or an anti-Myc PL14 antibody. In Vivo [3H]Palmitic Acid Labeling— HEK 293T cells grown on a 30-mm dish were transfected with plasmids and incubated for 23 h at 37 °C. Culture medium was then changed to 1.5 ml of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. After a 30-min incubation at 37 °C, 3 μg/ml cerulenin, which inhibits fatty acid synthesis, and 20 μm MG132 were added to the medium, and the cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were labeled with 0.2 mCi of [3H]palmitic acid (60 Ci/mmol; American Radiolabeled Chemical, St. Louis, MO) at 37 °C for 3 h. After washing with PBS, cells were treated with 1 ml radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. SPHK1 was immunoprecipitated using anti-SPHK1 antibodies and protein A-Sepharose as described above. Immunoprecipitates suspended in 2× SDS sample buffer containing 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol were boiled for 3 min, separated by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography using the fluorographic reagent EN3HANCE™ (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Preparation of Soluble and Membrane Fractions—HEK 293T cells transfected with plasmids were washed twice with PBS, suspended in buffer A, and sonicated. After removal of cell debris by centrifugation at 300 × g for 3 min at 4 °C, cell lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant and pellet were used as soluble and membrane fractions, respectively. Sphingosine Kinase Assay —Sphingosine kinase assays were performed as described elsewhere (33.Olivera A. Kohama T. Tu Z. Milstien S. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12576-12583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Tissue-specific Expression of SPHK1 Isoforms—There are variations in mouse SPHK1 mRNAs due to the differences in transcriptional initiation sites, and as a result, two different polypeptides, SPHK1a and SPHK1b, are produced (34.Imamura T. Miyauchi-Senda N. Tanaka S. Shiota K. J. Vet. Med. Sci. 2004; 66: 1387-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). At least four types of mRNAs, differing in the first exons, encode the same SPHK1a protein, whereas only one mRNA is known for SPHK1b (34.Imamura T. Miyauchi-Senda N. Tanaka S. Shiota K. J. Vet. Med. Sci. 2004; 66: 1387-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Translation of the SPHK1a protein is initiated near the end of the common second exon (Fig. 1). By searching EST clone databases, we found that certain SPHK1a-encoding mRNAs contain a 3-bp insertion in the coding region. This newly identified variation, named here SPHK1a2, is produced by an altered junction between the second and third exons. Consequently, the SPHK1a2 protein contains an extra Val residue. In contrast, transcription of SPHK1b mRNA is initiated within the intron region between the second and third exons of SPHK1a/SPHK1a2, so the 3′-half of the first exon of the SPHK1b gene is common to the third exon of SPHK1a/SPHK1a2 (34.Imamura T. Miyauchi-Senda N. Tanaka S. Shiota K. J. Vet. Med. Sci. 2004; 66: 1387-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Translation of the SPHK1b protein is initiated from 28 bp upstream of the 5′-terminal end of the third exon of SPHK1a2 (Fig. 1). Thus, there are three types of SPHK1 proteins, which differ only in their N termini. The N-terminal sequences specific to each are: SPHK1a, Met-Glu-Pro; SPHK1a2, Met-Glu-Pro-Val; SPHK1b, Met-Trp-Trp-Cys-Cys-Val-Leu-Phe-Val-Val. Of the 23 EST clones registered, we found that 8 represented SPHK1a, 12 represented SPHK1a2, and 3 represented SPHK1b, suggesting that SPHK1a2 may be the most abundant isoform, and SPHK1b may be only a minor isoform. We examined tissue- and embryonic development-specific expression patterns of SPHK1a/a2 and SPHK1b, although we were unable to prepare a specific primer that would distinguish SPHK1a mRNA from SPHK1a2 mRNA. Real-time quantitative PCR analysis revealed that SPHK1a/a2 mRNA is ubiquitously expressed, although levels vary among tissues and embryonic stages (Table 1). However, very little expression of SPHK1a/a2 mRNA was detectable in skeletal muscle, consistent with the extremely low sphingosine kinase activity in this tissue (31.Fukuda Y. Kihara A. Igarashi Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 309: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The expression of SPHK1b mRNA was more restrictive than that of SPHK1a (Table 1). Little SPHK1b mRNA expression was detected in heart, brain, liver, and skeletal muscle. The expression levels of SPHK1b mRNA were observed to be lower than those of SPHK1a/a2 mRNA regardless of the tissue, which is consistent with the small number of the EST clones carrying SPHK1b. The amount of SPHK1b mRNA was 10-20% that observed for SPHK1a/a2 mRNA in spleen, lung, kidney, and testis. In embryonic stages, days 11-15, the discrepancy was somewhat less, with SPHK1b mRNA levels at 67 and 37% of SPHK1a/a2 mRNA levels. Thus, it would appear that the expression of SPHK1a/a2 mRNA and that of SPHK1b mRNA are regulated differently among tissues and embryonic stages.TABLE 1Expression levels of SPHK1a/a2 and SPHK1b in various tissues and during embryonic development The mRNA expression of SPHK1a/a2 and SPHK1b was investigated in the indicated tissues and embryonic stages by real-time quantitative PCR as detailed under “Materials and Methods.” Values provided are relative to the GAPDH mRNA levels in the respective tissues or embryonic stages and represent the mean ± S.D. from three independent experiments.Tissue or embryonic stageRelative SPHK1 levelSPHK1a/a2SPHK1b×10–4Heart2.9 ± 0.400.96 ± 0.93Brain6.4 ± 1.51.1 ± 0.38Spleen190 ± 8.121 ± 3.2Lung240 ± 8248 ± 4.4Liver2.4 ± 0.500.52 ± 0.45Skeletal muscle0.48 ± 0.0300.062 ± 0.053Kidney19 ± 3.04.3 ± 0.56Testis51 ± 136.5 ± 6.57 Day430 ± 2462 ± 2.411 Day11 ± 1.97.4 ± 2.515 Day15 ± 1.75.5 ± 2.317 Day26 ± 1.43.7 ± 1.0 Open table in a new tab Abnormal Mobility of SPHK1b on SDS-PAGE—SPHK1b reportedly has a much lower activity than SPHK1a (13.Kohama T.

To study this phenomenon, we cloned each of the three isoforms and expressed them in mouse F9 cells. In immunoblots using anti-SPHK1 antibodies, SPHK1a and SPHK1a2 were detected at ∼43 kDa (Fig. 2A), in accordance with their predicted molecular masses (both 42.4 kDa). We found no differences in enzymatic characteristics (activity, gel mobility, membrane localization, stability, and oligomerization) between SPHK1a and SPHK1a2 (Fig. 2A and data not shown), so we described hereafter only SPHK1a. In contrast, the mobility of SPHK1b deviated from its predicted molecular mass (43.3 kDa) and was instead detected at 34 kDa (Fig. 2A). This mobility was not cell-specific, since it was also observed for HEK 293T cells (Figs. 3, 4, 5, 6). An additional band at 68 kDa, which may represent a SDS-resistant dimer (see Fig. 6), was also detected, although its level varied with the experimental conditions. A similar upper band was often observed in SPHK1a blots (Figs. 3B, 4A, and 6A); however, the intensity of the band was always lower than that observed for SPHK1b blots.FIGURE 4Ubiquitination of SPHK1.

Previous studies have described the role of SRF in controlling expression of structural genes involved in conferring the myogenic phenotype. Recent studies by us and others have demonstrated embryonic lethal cardiovascular phenotypes in SRF-null animals, but have not directly addressed the mechanistic role of SRF in controlling broad regulatory programs in cardiac cells. In this study, we used a loss-of-function approach to delineate the role of SRF in cardiomyocyte gene expression and function. In SRF-null neonatal cardiomyocytes, we observed severe defects in the contractile apparatus, including Z-disc and stress fiber formation, as well as mislocalization and/or attenuation of sarcomeric proteins. Consistent with this, gene array and reverse transcription-PCR analyses showed down-regulation of genes encoding key cardiac transcriptional regulatory factors and proteins required for the maintenance of sarcomeric structure, function, and regulation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that at least a subset of these proteins are likely regulated directly by SRF. The results presented here indicate that SRF is an essential coordinator of cardiomyocyte function due to its ability to regulate expression of numerous genes (some previously identified and at least 28 targets newly identified in this study) that are involved in multiple and disparate levels of sarcomeric function and assembly.

The serum response factor (SRF) 2The abbreviations used are: SRF, serum response factor; MHC, myosin heavy chain; Ad, adenovirus; RT, reverse transcription; GFP, green fluorescent protein; MEF-2, myocyte enhancer factor-2. is a member of the MADS (MCM1, AGAMOUS, DEFICIENS, SRF) box family of transcriptional regulatory proteins. SRF was first identified based on its ability to mediate serum and growth factor activation of the c-fos proto-oncogene (1Treisman R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4905-4913Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Subsequently, it was found that SRF and/or SRF-binding sites (CC(A/T)6GG), termed CArG boxes or serum response elements, regulate expression of a wide variety of inducible genes by various stimuli ranging from growth factors to changes in intracellular calcium flux (2Johansen F.E. Prywes R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1242: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). SRF plays a key role during early development and is required for successful gastrulation presumably due to its importance in mesoderm differentiation (3Arsenian S. Weinhold B. Oelgeschlager M. Ruther U. Nordheim A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6289-6299Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Numerous studies also suggest a role for SRF in myogenic differentiation and cardiac development and function. Cell culture studies have shown that functional SRF-binding elements are key cis-regulatory sites in the promoters of various cardiac contractile genes, including cardiac α-actin, β-myosin heavy chain (MHC), and dystrophin (4Minty A. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 2125-2136Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 5Sprenkle A.B. Murray S.F. Glembotski C.C. Circ.

Hugnot J.P. Lambert M. Chafey P. Kaplan J.C. Kahn A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10823-10830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SRF has also been implicated in the regulation of genes encoding non-contractile cardiac proteins, including the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase SERCA2 and the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger NCX1 (8Fisher S.A. Walsh K. Forehand C.J. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1996; 28: 113-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 9Cheng G. Hagen T.P. Dawson M.L. Barnes K.V. Menick D.R. J. Biol.

Further support for an important role for SRF in cardiac function comes from transgenic experiments in rodent model systems demonstrating that cardiac-specific dysregulation of SRF expression can induce cardiac hypertrophy and cardiomyopathies in postnatal animals that mimic those observed during the initial development of congestive heart failure, indicating that SRF may be involved in cardiac pathogenesis (10Zhang X. Azhar G. Chai J. Sheridan P. Nagano K. Brown T. Yang J. Khrapko K. Borras A.M. Lawitts J. Misra R.P. Wei J.Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: H1782-H1792Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Nelson T.J.

The role of SRF in cell regulation and differentiation has been largely elucidated via a series of in vitro loss-of-function experiments. It has been shown that skeletal muscle differentiation is blocked in C2C12 myoblasts by microinjection of anti-SRF antibody and that differentiation of proepicardial cells to coronary smooth muscle cells is blocked by the addition of a dominant inhibitory SRF (11Landerholm T.E. Dong X.R. Lu J. Belaguli N.S. Schwartz R.J. Majesky M.W. Development (Camb.). 1999; 126: 2053-2062Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SRF-null embryonic stem cells express low levels of focal adhesion proteins correlating with impairment in cell adhesion and migration and stress fiber formation (12Schratt G. Philippar U. Berger J. Schwarz H. Heidenreich O. Nordheim A. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 737-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). More recently, we (13Miano J.M. Ramanan N. Georger M.A. de Mesy Bentley K.L. Emerson R.L. Balza Jr., R.O. Xiao Q. Weiler H. Ginty D.D. Mirsa R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17132-17137Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) and others (14Parlakian A.

We have demonstrated, using conditional knockout animals, that SRF is required for normal cardiac trabeculation, compact layer expansion, sarcomeric assembly, and embryonic survival. These conditional knockout studies, although yielding significant advances in our understanding of the role of SRF in vivo, have been difficult to interpret at the cellular level and offer limited mechanistic insight into the role of SRF in the genetic basis of early lethality and heart function. Compensatory physiological mechanisms within the developing heart also complicate the interpretation of such experiments and may explain some of the phenotypic differences observed in these reports. The heterogeneity of cell types within the mouse heart and the secondary nonspecific effects of SRF-dependent cardiomyopathies are likely to mask the primary cellular effects of SRF allelic excision, further complicating analysis. Previous results using cultured myocytes have largely described the role of SRF in controlling expression of structural genes involved in conferring the myogenic phenotype. The recent in vivo loss-of-function studies cited above, although demonstrating lethal cardiovascular phenotypes, have not addressed the global mechanistic role of SRF in controlling broad regulatory programs in the cell. To more carefully address the role of SRF in regulating genetic programs important for controlling cardiomyocyte function, we took advantage of recently described conditional SRF mutant animals (16Miano J.M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2003; 35: 577-593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 17Ramanan N. Shen Y. Sarsfield S. Lemberger T. Schutz G. Linden D.J. Ginty D.D. Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 759-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) to generate SRF-null cardiomyocytes. We isolated transgenic neonatal cardiomyocytes homozygous for a floxed SRF allele and excised the SRF gene by transducing cells in culture with adenovirus encoding Cre recombinase (Ad-Cre). Consistent with animal studies, ultrastructural analysis of SRF-null cardiomyocytes revealed severe defects in the contractile apparatus, including Z-disc and stress fiber formation. To characterize gene expression changes that accompanied this phenotype, we performed cDNA array analysis, reverse transcription (RT)-PCR, and immunofluorescence on SRF-null myocytes. This analysis revealed the attenuation of key sarcomeric, cytoskeletal, and transcription factor genes in cardiomyocytes lacking SRF. These results demonstrate that not only does SRF regulate structural factors important for muscle function, but significantly that SRF is a central coordinator of numerous genes (some previously identified and at least 28 targets newly identified in this study) involved in multiple and disparate levels of sarcomeric function and assembly. Primary Cardiomyocyte Culture and Transduction—SRFf/f mice were generated by Drs. Naren Ramanan and David Ginty as described previously (16Miano J.M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2003; 35: 577-593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 17Ramanan N. Shen Y. Sarsfield S. Lemberger T. Schutz G. Linden D.J. Ginty D.D. Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 759-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Ventricular tissue was carefully dissected and dissociated in 0.41 mg/ml collagenase (Sigma) and 0.30 mg/ml pancreatin (Sigma) in Ads buffer (116 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, 0.8 mm NaH2PO4, 1 g/liter glucose, 5.4 mm KCI, 0.8 mm MgSO4, pH 7.35). Cardiomyocytes were enriched on a discontinuous Percoll gradient (40.5 over 58.5%; Sigma) and plated at 50,000 cells/well on a gelatin-coated 24-well plate (Costar). Cultured cardiomyocytes were transduced with Ad-Cre (courtesy of Dr. Beverly Davidson, University of Iowa) or a control virus encoding green fluorescent protein (Ad-GFP; Medical College of Wisconsin Adenoviral Core Facility) at a multiplicity of infection of 25. Each Ad construct drives exogenous gene expression via a cytomegalovirus promoter stabilized with a metallothionein polyadenylation signal. Electron Microscopy—Transmission electron microscopy was carried out at the Medical College of Wisconsin Facility for Electron Microscopy. Five days after transduction, cardiomyocytes were fixed in 0.1 m cacodylate-buffered 2.5% glutaraldehyde, embedded in epoxy resin, sectioned, and imaged on a Hitachi 600 electron microscope. Thin sections (60 nm) were evaluated at magnifications of ×5000, ×25,000, and ×40,000. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Total protein was isolated from cardiomyocytes 5 days after transduction in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, 10 mm Na3VO4, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin). A probe containing the SRF-binding site in the Nppa (natriuretic peptide precursor type A) gene was amplified by PCR using primers 5′-CAGGTGTGAAGGTAACTCCA-3′ and 5′-GCTGTCAGGGGCTCCAAATA-3′. The probe (50 ng) was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase, incubated with protein lysate (4 μg), and separated on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. Supershift assays were performed by preincubation of protein lysate with anti-SRF antibody (G-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Gels were dried and exposed on Biomax MS film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Identification of Conserved CArG Boxes—SRF-binding sites were defined as allowing for one nucleotide mismatch from the consensus CC(A/T)6GG sequence (16Miano J.M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2003; 35: 577-593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Putative SRF target gene sequence including 5 kilobase pairs upstream and downstream of the predicted transcriptional start site was obtained from the May 2004 Mouse Genome Assembly (available at genome.ucsc.edu/). Conservation was determined by the Jotun Hein (79Hein J.J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 183: 626-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) method of alignment using the Lasergene suite of genome analysis software (DNASTAR, Inc.). Indirect Immunofluorescence—Cardiomyocytes were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized in 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and blocked in 3% bovine serum albumin. Primary antibodies were used as follows. Rabbit anti-SRF polyclonal antibody (raised against the C terminus of SRF by Proteintech Group Inc.) was used at 1:300 dilution. Anti-phosphohistone H3 antibody (Upstate) was used to label mitotic nuclei at 1:200 dilution. Antibody EA-53 (Sigma) was used to label sarcomeric α-actinin at 1:200 dilution. All other antibodies were obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa: CH-1 (developed by Jim Jung-Ching Lin and used at 1:40 dilution) for labeling sarcomeric tropomyosin, CT3 (developed by Jim Jung-Ching Lin and used at 1:200 dilution) for labeling troponin T, and MF-20 (developed by D. A. Fischman and used at 1:200 dilution) for labeling sarcomeric myosin. The cells were then incubated with a fluorescent secondary antibody (green Alexa 488 or red Alexa 568, Molecular Probes) at 1:200 dilution. The cells were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma) to label the nuclei blue or propidium iodide (Sigma) to label the nuclei red and/or with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated phalloidin (1:20 dilution; Molecular Probes) to label filamentous actin green. Coverslips were mounted on glass slides using Mowiol 4-88 medium (Calbiochem) and visualized using a Nikon Eclipse TE300 inverted fluorescence microscope equipped with ×20/0.45 and ×40/0.60 Plan Fluor objectives. Images were acquired with a SPOT RT digital camera using SPOT RT Version 3.3 imaging software. Microarray Hybridization, Statistical Analysis, and Confirmation by RT-PCR—Mouse 430 2.0 gene arrays (Affymetrix) were used to analyze the transcription profiles of Ad-GFP (control)-transduced and Ad-Cre (SRF-null)-transduced cardiomyocytes. For each array, double-strand cDNA was synthesized from 8 μg of total RNA using oligo(dT) primers, SuperScript II reverse transcriptase, and Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I (Invitrogen). Biotin-labeled antisense cRNA was synthesized using the BioArray HighYield RNA transcript labeling kit (Enzo Biochem, Inc.). The labeled cRNA was purified, fragmented, and subsequently hybridized using the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 400. Raw data were scanned with the Affymetrix Scanner 3000, processed with dChip Version 1.3 software (available at dchip.org), and imported into Microsoft Excel for analysis. A statistical ±1.5-fold change (p < 0.05) was considered significant. For RT-PCR, total RNA was reverse-transcribed using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and random hexamer primers (Roche Applied Science). This cDNA provided templates for PCRs that contained dNTPs, [α-32P]dCTP, Taq DNA polymerase, and specific primer pairs. 3PCR primer sequences are available upon request. PCR products were separated on 5% acrylamide gels, detected in dried gels using a PhosphorImager (Storm 840, Amersham Biosciences), and quantitated using Image-Quant Version 5.2 software. PCRs were performed at various cycles to ensure linear amplification (data not shown), and minus-RT controls were performed to ensure specific amplification. All numerical quantification is the mean ± S.D. of four independently performed experiments. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—Ventricular tissue from 3-week-old male CD-1 mice was fixed with 1% formaldehyde and homogenized using 50-μm Medicons in a Medimachine (BD Biosciences). Homogenized tissue was sonicated to obtain 500-800-bp DNA fragments. Immunoprecipitation was performed using a chromatin immunoprecipitation kit (catalog no. 17-295, Upstate) according to the suggested protocol of the manufacturer. For precipitation of SRF, rabbit anti-SRF polyclonal antibody (raised against the C terminus of SRF) was used. 3PCR primer sequences are available upon request. To investigate the role of SRF in cardiac myocyte function, neonatal cardiomyocytes were isolated from homozygous floxed SRF (SRFf/f) animals (16Miano J.M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2003; 35: 577-593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 17Ramanan N. Shen Y. Sarsfield S. Lemberger T. Schutz G. Linden D.J. Ginty D.D. Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 759-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Excision of the floxed SRF allele was mediated by transducing myocytes with Ad-Cre. The efficiency of the Ad-Cre-mediated excision over a 5-day time course was evaluated at 24-h time points via genomic PCR assay using primers specific for the excised region of SRF (Fig. 1A). Unexcised SRFf/f alleles were undetectable by this method 5 days after transduction. To ensure that no spurious transcription of the excised SRFf/f gene occurred following excision, an RT-PCR time course was carried out using primers specific to the SRF C terminus (Fig. 1B). SRF mRNA was significantly reduced (p < 0.01) by 15.7 ± 4.1-fold in myocytes transduced with Ad-Cre relative to those transduced with the control virus, Ad-GFP (Fig. 1C). GFP is commonly used as a molecular marker and is thought to be biologically inert (18Heim R. Prasher D.C. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12501-12504Crossref PubMed Scopus (1506) Google Scholar). However, an isolated report has suggested that high levels of GFP expression may be linked to dilated cardiomyopathy in transgenic mice (19Huang W.Y. Aramburu J. Douglas P.S. Izumo S. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 482-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In this study, we did not observe significant differences between cardiomyocytes transduced with Ad-GFP and untreated cells (data not shown). We have shown previously that the half-life of SRF protein in fibroblasts is ∼12 h (20Misra R.P. Rivera V.M. Wang J.M. Fan P.D. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4545-4554Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To determine whether significant levels of SRF protein persist 5 days after Ad-Cre transduction in cardiac myocytes, we assayed the presence of SRF protein using indirect immunofluorescence (Fig. 1D). We observed that 95.9 ± 2.4% of the myocytes were SRF-positive in untransduced control cells compared with 5.2 ± 3.9% in myocytes 5 days after Ad-Cre transduction (Fig. 1E). To determine whether this represents a significant decrease in overall functional SRF protein, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays 5 days after transduction with Ad-Cre or Ad-GFP (Fig. 1F). Quantification of the results from the electrophoretic mobility shift assay experiments (n = 3) revealed a 27.8 ± 8.2-fold decrease in SRF protein 5 days after treatment with Ad-Cre (Fig. 1G). Based on these results, we conclude that transduction with Ad-Cre mediates an efficient reduction of SRF mRNA and protein within 5 days after transduction. SRF cofactors in the ETS family have been shown to regulate proliferation and to protect human embryonic kidney cells from apoptotic death through an SRF-dependent mechanism (21Vickers E.R. Kasza A. Kurnaz I.A. Seifert A. Zeef L.A. O'Donnell A. Hayes A. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 10340-10351Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Additionally, neonatal mice with inactivated Homeodomain-Only Protein (HOP), an SRF inhibitor, display cardiac hyperplasia (22Shin C.H. Liu Z.P. Passier R. Zhang C.L. Wang D.Z. Harris T.M. Yamagishi H. Richardson J.A. Childs G. Olson E.N. Cell. 2002; 110: 725-735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In contrast, SRF-null embryonic stem cells are viable and continue to proliferate in culture (23Schratt G. Weinhold B. Lundberg A.S. Schuck S. Berger J. Schwarz H. Weinberg R.A. Ruther U. Nordheim A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2933-2943Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), and cardiac-specific inactivation of SRF during embryonic development appears to have no effect on cardiomyocyte proliferation (13Miano J.M. Ramanan N. Georger M.A. de Mesy Bentley K.L. Emerson R.L. Balza Jr., R.O. Xiao Q. Weiler H. Ginty D.D. Mirsa R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17132-17137Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 14Parlakian A. Tuil D. Hamard G. Tavernier G. Hentzen D. Concordet J.P. Paulin D. Li Z. Daegelen D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 5281-5289Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In light of these incongruous data, we addressed whether SRF is required for cardiomyocyte viability by trypan blue exclusion assay and whether SRF is required for cardiomyocyte proliferation by staining a mitotic indicator, phosphohistone H3. As shown in Fig. 2 (A-C), we observed no difference in cell viability or proliferative capacity in SRF-null cardiomyocytes compared with control cells. The proliferation rates of SRF-null cells (5.6 ± 2.8%) and control myocytes (5.1 ± 2.0%) were consistent with the 3-12% proliferation rate previously reported for rodent neonatal cardiomyocytes (24Soonpaa M.H. Field L.J. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Together, these data support the conclusion that SRF is dispensable for cardiomyocyte viability and division. Examination of control neonatal cardiomyocyte cultures revealed that the majority of the cells were spontaneously beating. However, we observed only isolated rare pockets of weakly beating myocytes 5 days after treatment with Ad-Cre, suggesting that cell morphology and regulation and/or structure of the contractile apparatus may be disrupted in SRF-null cells. Numerous studies have indicated that SRF is important for regulating various aspects of cellular architecture, including cell shape, cell movement, actin dynamics, and actin gene expression. Therefore, we initially examined the effect of SRF on cell morphology by comparing control and SRF-null cardiomyocytes by transmission electron microscopy. Transmission electron microscopy analysis revealed dramatic differences in myofibrillar organization between SRF-null and control cells. In control cells, myofibrils were organized into large parallel stacks, divided into ∼1.25-μm sarcomeric units by evenly spaced Z-disks (Fig. 3, A and C). Mitochondria were observed to be frequently aligned and in close association with the myofibrils. In stark contrast, SRF-null cardiomyocytes generally contained a small number of insubstantial and unaligned myofibrils, which were frequently observed to be unassociated with mitochondria (Fig. 3, B and D). In some cells, small bundles of myofilaments were observed in close association with the membrane, reminiscent of the punctate round Z-bodies commonly thought to represent the precursors of Z-discs in developing striated muscle (25Dabiri G.A. Turnacioglu K.K. Sanger J.M. Sanger J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9493-9498Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we also observed a reduction in the abundance of spiral polysomes, which are thought to indicate myosin translation, in SRF-null cells (Fig. 3F) compared with control cells (Fig. 3E). Taken together, these observations indicate that SRF is required for proper assembly of the contractile apparatus in cardiac myocytes. To identify SRF-dependent genes responsible for the maintenance of contractile apparatus structure, we performed cDNA expression analysis on SRF-null cardiomyocytes. Microarray technology (Affymetrix GeneChip 430 2.0) was used to define the transcription profile of >34,000 mouse genes in cardiomyocytes treated with Ad-Cre or with Ad-GFP as a control. The number and diversity of gene expression changes in SRF-null cardiomyocytes was striking. There were 388 genes (281 known genes and 107 additional expressed cDNAs) that exhibited ≥1.5-fold decreases. The attenuated genes encompass diverse functional groups. Prominent among these are sarcomeric, cytoskeletal/cell adhesion, and transcription factor proteins. Table 1 provides a summary of the 80 attenuated genes that we were able to functionally classify by known or putative function. The complete gene array data have been deposited in the NCBI gene expression and hybridization array depository under accession number GSE3181 (available at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). Comparison of these data with the recently reported gene array analysis of SRF-null embryonic stem cells by Zhang et al. (27Zhang S.X. Garcia-Gras E. Wycuff D.R. Marriot S.J. Kadeer N. Yu W. Olson E.N. Garry D.J. Parmacek M.S. Schwartz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19115-19126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) revealed that only three genes were attenuated by the inactivation of SRF in each model system (Actc1, Myl3, and Itga9). This finding likely indicates dramatic differences in the genetic regulatory network of embryonic stem cells compared with fully differentiated cardiac myocytes and may further reflect the disparate roles of SRF during early differentiation of the mesodermal lineage and maintenance of the cardiogenic phenotype. We undertook a rigorous series (n = 4) of semiquantitative RT-PCRs to confirm the observed gene expression changes, focusing on genes implicated in contractile apparatus function and assembly (Fig. 4). As expected, many genes known to constitute the functional contractile apparatus in the heart were significantly down-regulated in SRF-null cardiomyocytes. For example, the expression levels of three α-actin isoforms, calponin, cardiac troponin C, desmin, two MHC isoforms, SM22, and two tropomyosin isoforms were attenuated by ≥3.0-fold. The LIM domain-containing proteins CRP1 and CRP2 were also attenuated in SRF-null myocytes. CRP family members bind to the cytoskeletal and contractile proteins zyxin and actinin (28Chang D.F.

When expressed in JEG-3 cells, the M2 receptor exhibits much higher susceptibility than the M3 receptor to agonist-induced down-regulation.

Over the last decade, many studies have shown broad evidence that G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) 3The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; mAChR, muscarinic acetylcholine receptor; TMD, transmembrane domain; BRET, bioluminescence resonance energy transfer; RLuc, Renilla luciferase; YFP, yellow fluorescence protein, GFP, green fluorescence protein; Smo, smoothened; QNB, quinuclidinyl benzilate; i3, third intracellular loop; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HA, hemagglutinin. interact with one another to form constitutive homo- or hetero-oligomers. GPCR dimerization has been implicated in many aspects of receptor pharmacology, such as maturation, ligand binding, activation, signaling, desensitization, endocytosis, and trafficking (1Bouvier M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 274-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar, 2Angers S. Salahpour A. Bouvier M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

In the early 1990s, several studies showed that muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChR), like other GPCR, might be arranged in dimeric or oligomeric complexes. Complex binding curves for both muscarinic agonists and antagonists were interpreted as evidence for the existence of multiple states of affinity, which is consistent with the notion of binding sites located on dimeric receptor molecules (4Hirschberg B.T. Schimerlik M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26127-26135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Potter L.T. Ballesteros L.A. Bichajian L.H. Ferrendelli C.A. Fisher A. Hanchett H.E. Zhang R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 39: 211-221PubMed Google Scholar). More recent studies on mAChR have shown that such heterogeneity of affinity should rather be attributed to nucleotide-sensitive cooperative effects between interacting sites (6Chidiac P. Wells J.W. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10908-10921Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 7Chidiac P. Green M.A. Pawagi A.B. Wells J.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7361-7379Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Because there seems to be one binding site per receptor molecule, cooperativity suggests that mAChR are actually oligomers formed by two or more interacting sites (6Chidiac P. Wells J.W. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10908-10921Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Additional pharmacological evidence that mAChR can form dimers was provided by Maggio et al. (8Maggio R. Vogel Z. Wess J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3103-3107Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), who used chimeric α2-adrenergic/M3 muscarinic receptors composed of the first five transmembrane domains (TMD) of one receptor and the last two TMD of the other. No binding or signaling was detected when either fusion protein was expressed alone, but coexpression of both chimeras rescued binding activity and signaling properties of both adrenergic and muscarinic ligands. These results were interpreted as intermolecular interactions between two inactive receptors now engaged in a dimeric complex with restored receptor functional properties. However, such trans-complementation results have been challenged because of the fact that those intermolecular interactions were seen by studying mutant receptors and not wild type receptors (1Bouvier M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 274-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Coimmunoprecipitation of solubilized epitope-tagged M3 mAChR and Western blot analysis has also been employed to demonstrate the existence of mAChR oligomers in a direct fashion. This biochemical approach revealed that the M3 mAChR is capable of forming disulfide-linked as well as noncovalent dimers/multimers (9Zeng F.Y. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19487-19497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Although coimmunoprecipitation/immunoblotting assays provide fairly convincing evidence for mAChR dimer formation, such studies have been criticized for the possibility that the observed receptor aggregation could result from an artifact because of the presence of concentrated preparations of highly hydrophobic molecules following the solubilization process (1Bouvier M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 274-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Over the last decade, several groups have used biophysical assays based on light resonance energy transfer to assess GPCR oligomerization (1Bouvier M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 274-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar, 2Angers S. Salahpour A. Bouvier M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

A. 2000; 97: 3684-3689PubMed Google Scholar). Fluorescence resonance energy transfer and its variation, bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET), have been used extensively to overcome technological limitations present in pharmacological and biochemical methods because they have the distinct advantage of monitoring real time interactions between proteins synthesized in their correct location in living cells (10Kroeger K.M. Pfleger K.D.G. Eidne K.A. Front. Neuroendocrinol. 2004; 24: 254-278Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In the classical BRET methodology, the first protein is fused to Renilla luciferase (RLuc), and the second protein partner is fused to a fluorescent protein (yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)). If both partners interact, resonance energy transfer between RLuc (donor) and the YFP (acceptor) can be measured upon addition of the RLuc substrate coelenterazine (12Xu Y. Piston D.W. Johnson C.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). In this study, the occurrence of constitutive homo- and hetero-oligomers among M1, M2, and M3 mAChR was investigated in living cells expressing physiological levels of these receptors by BRET. BRET saturation experiments were conducted to estimate the relative ability of each receptor subtype to engage in homo- and heterotropic interactions. The nature of such homo-oligomers, the proportion of receptor molecules forming those oligomeric complexes, and the effect of muscarinic agonist on M1, M2, and M3 mAChR homo- and heterodimerization were also addressed. Finally, we examined the implications of oligomerization on mAChR function by determining the effect of M2/M3 heterodimerization on agonist-induced M3 mAChR regulation. Materials—[3H]Quinuclidinyl benzilate ([3H]QNB, 42 Ci/mmol) and N-[3H]methylscopolamine (81 Ci/mmol) were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium, penicillin/streptomycin, and fetal bovine serum were purchased from Invitrogen. Restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA), and coelenterazine h was obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). The anti-HA polyclonal antibody (HA.11) was purchased from Covance (Berkeley, CA). Carbamylcholine chloride (carbachol), atropine sulfate, anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody, and all other reagents were purchased from Sigma. The monoclonal antibody against the porcine cardiac M2 mAChR was generated and characterized by Luetje et al. (13Luetje C.W. Brumwell C. Norman M.G. Peterson G.L. Schimerlik M.I. Nathanson N.M. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6892-6896Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Receptor Constructs—mAChR-RLuc and mAChR-YFP fusion proteins were constructed by ligating the Renilla luciferase (RLuc) and the YFP moieties to the C-terminal end of the receptors. Mouse M1, porcine M2, and human M3 mAChR coding sequences without their stop codons were amplified by using sense and antisense primers harboring unique restriction sites. The fragments were then subcloned in-frame into pRL-CMV-RLuc (Promega) or pEYFP-N1 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Restriction sites used were as follows: XhoI/BamHI (M1-RLuc, M1-YFP), XhoI/SacII (M2-RLuc, M2-YFP), EcoRV/BamHI (M3-RLuc), and EcoRI/BamHI (M3-YFP). pEYFP was cut with AgeI and BsrGI, and the YFP fragment was inserted into the AgeI/BsrGI site from human Smoothened-GFP (Smo-GFP) to give Smo-YFP. Smo-GFP was provided by Dr. A. Kaykas (University of Washington). The HA-M3 mAChR expression plasmid was obtained from University of Missouri-Rolla cDNA Resource Center (Rolla, MO). All other constructs have been described elsewhere (14Nadler L.S. Kumar G. Nathanson N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10539-10547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 15Kaykas A. Yang-Snyder J. Héroux M. Shah K.V. Bouvier M. Moon R.T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK 293 or JEG-3 cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and penicillin (100 units/ml)/streptomycin sulfate (0.1 mg/ml) at 37 °C in a humidified 10% CO2 environment. Transient transfections were performed on cells that were at 70–80% confluence using the calcium phosphate precipitation protocol (16Mellon P. Parker V. Gluzman Y. Maniatis T. Cell. 1981; 27: 279-288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Pharmacological Characterization of Constructs—HEK 293 cells grown in 15-cm dishes were transfected with RLuc-tagged, YFP-tagged, or nontagged mAChR (12.5-25 μg of DNA/plate). Following a 36-h period post-transfection, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, and membranes were obtained as described previously (17Goin J.C. Nathanson N.M. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 964-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Saturation binding studies were performed by incubating membranes with increasing concentrations of [3H]QNB at 37 °C for 90 min in 50 mm sodium/potassium phosphate, pH 7.4. Atropine (1 μm) was used to define nonspecific binding. The reaction was stopped by rapid filtration over GF/C glass-fiber filters (Whatman). Filters were then washed four times with cold phosphate buffer, and the retained radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. Curves were analyzed by nonlinear regression analysis using Prism 4 software (GraphPad, San Diego). BRET Assays—Thirty six hours after transfection, HEK 293 cells were distributed in 96-well microplates (white opaque Isoplate, Wallac) washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and resuspended in PBS/glucose 0.1% in the presence or absence of 10 μm carbachol at 25 °C. Coelenterazine h was added at a final concentration of 5 μm, and light intensity was sequentially integrated in the 510–590 and 440–500 nm windows using a Victor2 multiplate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). BRET ratio was defined as ((emission at 510–590)/(emission at 440–500)) – Cf, where Cf corresponded to (emission at 510–590)/(emission at 440–500) for the receptor RLuc constructs expressed alone in the same experiments. Fluorescence and Luminescence Measurements—Transiently transfected HEK 293 cells were harvested, washed, and resuspended as described above and then distributed in 96-well microplates (either clear-bottomed or white opaque Isoplates for fluorescence and luminescence determinations, respectively). Both determinations were also carried out in a Victor2 multiplate reader. The total fluorescence of cells was measured using an excitation filter of 485 nm and an emission filter of 535 nm. For assessing the activity of Renilla luciferase, total luminescence was determined on samples incubated with 5 μm coelenterazine. For both measurements, the means of duplicate wells were calculated. Total fluorescence values were then divided by the background determined in wells containing untransfected cells. The background values for total luminescence were negligible, and they were subtracted from sample values. Titration of Donor and Acceptor Fusion Proteins—Expression levels of mAChR-RLuc and mAChR-YFP constructs were monitored by measuring luminescence and fluorescence, respectively, as described above. This procedure is based on the observation that luminescence and fluorescence levels of several receptor-RLuc and receptor-YFP (or receptor-GFP) fusion proteins have been found to be linearly correlated with receptor numbers (18Ayoub M.A. Levoye A. Delagrange P. Jockers R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 66: 312-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Because this correlation is an intrinsic property of each fusion protein, we tested whether our mAChR fusion proteins followed a linear correlation pattern. Thus, we expressed each mAChR-RLuc or mAChR-YFP at different levels in HEK 293 cells and assessed the relationship between luciferase activity or fluorescence, respectively, and the amount of mAChR-binding sites in the same cells. Thirty six hours after transfection, ∼20,000 HEK 293 cells were incubated with 1 nm [3H]QNB in PBS, 0.1% glucose for 90 min at 25 °C. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 μm atropine. The reaction was stopped by rapid filtration over GF/C glass-fiber filters, which were then washed four times with cold PBS. Retained radioactivity was determined as described above. Luminescence and fluorescence (arbitrary units) were plotted against total binding sites, and linear regression curves were obtained (supplemental Fig. 2). These standard curves generated for each single experiment were used to transform fluorescence and luminescence values into femtomoles of receptor. Thus, the fluorescence/luminescence ratios were transformed into (receptor-YFP)/(receptor-RLuc) ratios, which allowed us to determine accurate BRETmax and BRET50 values (19Mercier J.F. Salahpour A. Angers S. Breit A. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44925-44931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Protein concentration of samples was determined to control for the number of cells and also to express receptor numbers in femtomole/mg of total cell protein, using the standard method described by Lowry et al. (20Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Receptor Down-regulation Assays—Determination of agonist-induced M2 or M3 mAChR down-regulation was accomplished using the binding of the membrane-permeable muscarinic ligand [3H]QNB to intact cells expressing either mAChR subtype, as described previously (21Schlador M.L. Grubbs R.D. Nathanson N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23295-23302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, JEG-3 cells were transiently transfected with either M2 or FLAG-M3 mAChR DNA constructs. Forty eight hours later cells were incubated either with 1 mm carbachol for different times (within a 0–12-h-range) or in the presence of various concentrations of carbachol for 12 h at 37 °C. Cells were then washed with ice-cold PBS and labeled with a saturating concentration of [3H]QNB (∼1 nm) in PBS for 90 min at 37 °C. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 μm atropine. Labeled cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and filtered onto GF/C membrane filters (Whatman). Filters were then washed with ice-cold PBS, transferred to scintillation vials, and combined with scintillation fluid before the determination of radioactivity by scintillation counting. Down-regulation of Coexpressed M2 and M3 mAChR—JEG-3 cells were transfected with M2 mAChR, FLAG-M3 mAChR, or both DNA constructs at different proportions following the procedure indicated above. Forty eight hours post-transfection, cells were treated with 10 μm carbachol for 12 h at 37 °C. Cells were then washed with ice-cold PBS, harvested in 50 mm sodium/potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, supplemented with protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml leupeptin, 70 μg/ml phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 0.25 μg/ml pepstatin A), and were glass-glass homogenized. Membranes were obtained as described previously (17Goin J.C. Nathanson N.M. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 964-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), and the total number of mAChR in crude membrane homogenates was determined using the binding of [3H]QNB as described by Halvorsen and Nathanson (22Halvorsen S.W. Nathanson N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7941-7948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The numbers of M2 and FLAG-M3 mAChR were measured by the immunoprecipitation assay described previously (23McKinnon L.A. Nathanson N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20636-20642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) using anti-M2 and anti-FLAG monoclonal antibodies, respectively. Alternatively, control experiments were performed by cotransfecting cells with FLAG-M3 mAChR and HA-M3 mAChR at different relative expression levels, as determined by immunoprecipitation using anti-FLAG and anti-HA antibodies (23McKinnon L.A. Nathanson N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20636-20642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The extent of FLAG-M3 down-regulation after carbachol treatment was then determined as indicated above. Data Analysis—BRET saturation curves were analyzed using Prism 4 software. Isotherms were fitted using a nonlinear regression equation assuming a single binding site, which provided BRETmax and BRET50 values. The correlation between fluorescence or luminescence and receptor density was analyzed by linear regression curve fitting with the same software. Statistical significance of differences in M2 versus M3 mAChR regulation was assessed by the two-tailed unpaired Student’s t test. Homo- and heterodimerization of M1, M2, and M3 mAChR were assessed in live HEK 293 cells by quantitative BRET analysis. For this purpose, the three mAChR subtypes were fused at their C terminus to the energy donor RLuc or the acceptor YFP. To ensure that the expressed fusion proteins were properly folded polypeptides capable of binding muscarinic ligands, we assessed their binding properties by saturation binding assays using the muscarinic antagonist [3H]QNB. Detailed analysis of the Kd values obtained from those saturation curves (Table 1) indicated that the modifications at the C terminus of M1, M2, and M3 mAChR did not significantly alter the affinity for the muscarinic radioligand as compared with the wild type receptors. In another set of experiments, all constructs were individually expressed in HEK 293 cells, and the binding of the membrane-impermeable muscarinic ligand N-[3H]methylscopolamine was determined in parallel with the binding of the membrane-permeable muscarinic antagonist [3H]QNB at saturating radioligand concentrations for each receptor expressed. Because no significant difference was found between the binding levels of both radioligands to the same receptor, 4J. C. Goin and N. M. Nathanson, unpublished observations. we concluded that all fusion proteins are expressed at the cell surface and that such colocalization ensures their chances of interacting with each other.TABLE 1Binding parameters of M1, M2, and M3 mAChR constructsConstructKdpmM1 mAChR-RLuc13.7 ± 0.9M1 mAChR-YFP13.0 ± 0.7WT-M1 mAChR11.7 ± 2.0M2 mAChR-RLuc19.4 ± 2.0M2 mAChR-YFP24.6 ± 3.3WT-M2 mAChR24.0 ± 2.8M3 mAChR-RLuc38.6 ± 3.2M3 mAChR-YFP33.6 ± 4.2WT-M3 mAChR37.8 ± 2.5 Open table in a new tab To determine whether M1, M2, and M3 mAChR can form homodimers in intact cells, we assessed the ability of coexpressed RLuc-tagged mAChR and YFP-tagged mAChR to interact with one another by BRET saturation curve analysis. HEK 293 cells were transiently cotransfected with a constant amount of the RLuc construct and increasing amounts of the YFP construct, and the transfer of energy between both fusion proteins was measured upon addition of the Renilla luciferase substrate coelenterazine h. The expression levels of each RLuc-tagged receptor were assessed by detection of total luminescence from the previous luciferase reaction, and the expression levels of the YFP-tagged receptors were monitored by determination of total fluorescence. Because the expression levels of RLuc constructs were found to be modified by the cotransfection of increasing amounts of their YFP partners, BRET signals were plotted as a function of the fluorescence/luminescence ratio. Coexpression of M1, M2, or M3 donor molecules with their homologous acceptor partners resulted in classical saturation isotherms (Fig. 1, A–C), in which BRET signals increased as a hyperbolic function of the concentration of the acceptor, reaching an asymptote that corresponds to the saturation of all BRET donors by acceptor molecules. This observation suggests that M1, M2, and M3 mAChR form constitutive homodimers in live cells. To ensure that these BRET signals did not result from a spurious interaction between RLuc and YFP, we performed control assays in which each RLuc-tagged mAChR was coexpressed with increasing amounts of soluble YFP. These saturation assays resulted in quasi-linear curves showing marginal BRET signals, which indicate a nonspecific interaction between both coexpressed partners in each case. The selectivity of the interaction between donor and acceptor mAChR was further assessed to rule out the possibility of nonspecific BRET signals because of transmembrane protein overexpression. The distantly related seven transmembrane signaling receptor Smoothened fused to YFP (Smo-YFP) was cotransfected with M1, M2, or M3 mAChR-RLuc, which resulted in a dramatically decreased BRET ratio for the three mAChR tested. In contrast, coexpression of Smo-RLuc with increasing amounts of Smo-YFP yielded significantly higher BRET levels (supplemental Fig. 1), indicating that Smo-RLuc is effectively capable of forming constitutive dimers in intact cells when coexpressed with a specific partner. BRET data were not influenced by the relative position of RLuc or YFP on the receptor pairs because identical results were obtained for the reciprocal orientation. 4J. C. Goin and N. M. Nathanson, unpublished observations. These data confirm our previous observation, indicating that M1, M2, and M3 donor and acceptor fusion proteins are engaged in specific interactions as constitutive homodimers. Although the saturation curves shown previously suggest that M1, M2, and M3 donor and acceptor specifically interact with each other, they do not provide enough information about the binding parameters required for proper quantitative analysis of receptor-receptor interactions. Therefore, we conducted a new set of saturation experiments in which the amount of each receptor effectively expressed in transfected cells was monitored, for each individual experiment, by correlating both total luminescence and total fluorescence with the number of [3H]QNB-binding sites. The analysis of such correlation shows a linear relationship between total luminescence and receptor density with no significant differences among the slopes obtained for the three mAChR receptor subtypes (supplemental Fig. 2). Correlation analysis between total fluorescence and total receptor numbers also yielded linear curves. However, the slope obtained for M1-YFP was significantly higher than that from either M2-YFP or M3-YFP. The linear regression equations shown in supplemental Fig. 2 were used to transform fluorescence and luminescence units to receptor numbers, and BRET signals were plotted as a function of (receptor-YFP number)/(receptor-RLuc number) ratio. These new BRET saturation curves also behaved as hyperbolic functions reaching a saturation level (Fig. 2). According to classical analysis of BRET-monitored protein-protein interaction assuming one binding site, the concentration of the acceptor giving 50% of the energy transfer (BRET50) accounts for the relative affinity between both interacting protomers, and the maximal BRET signal depends on the total number of dimers formed as well as on the distance between the donor and the acceptor within the dimer (19Mercier J.F. Salahpour A. Angers S. Breit A. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44925-44931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). When comparing the curves obtained for M1, M2, and M3 mAChR homodimers (Table 2), no significant differences in BRET50 values were found, indicating that the affinities of protomers for one another are similar among the three mAChR subtypes studied. On the other hand the BRETmax value for the M1 donor-acceptor pair was found to be significantly different from that for M2 and M3 homodimers. Indeed, the BRETmax for the M1-RLuc/M1-YFP pair was over twice as high as the other BRETmax values. This could indicate that either a higher percentage of the M1 subtype is engaged in homodimerization or that energy transfer between RLuc and YFP within the M1 homodimer is more efficient than that for M2 and M3 homodimers. Because the relative affinities between each of the partners were found to be very similar among the three receptor subtypes (Table 2), the second hypothesis is more likely. Moreover, the fact that correlation curves between total fluorescence and receptor density yielded a higher slope value for M1 suggests that YFP functions as a more efficient acceptor when it is fused to the M1 receptor subtype, which may result in higher BRET values for this pair.TABLE 2Homodimerization of M1, M2, and M3 mAChR; parameters from BRET saturation curvesPair transfectedBRETmaxBRET50% of receptors existing as dimersM1-RLuc/M1-YFP0.285 ± 0.0071.83 ± 0.1472 ± 4M2-RLuc/M2-YFP0.139 ± 0.0041.70 ± 0.2378 ± 8M3-RLuc/M3-YFP0.128 ± 0.0031.41 ± 0.1383 ± 6 Open table in a new tab To assess the nature of M1, M2, and M3 mAChR homo-oligomers, we compared their corresponding experimental saturation curves (Fig. 2) with the expected ones for dimeric, trimeric, and tetrameric complexes using a modification of the equation by Veatch and Stryer (24Veatch W. Stryer L. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 113: 89-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). This formula describes the probability of forming BRET-competent complexes as a function of the oligomeric size of the receptor (19Mercier J.F. Salahpour A. Angers S. Breit A. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44925-44931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). The experimental curves fit better to the theoretical curve predicted for a dimer rather than those expected for a trimer or tetramer, suggesting that the oligomeric fraction of M1, M2, or M3 mAChR populations is predominantly composed of dimeric complexes (Fig. 3). Detailed quantitative analysis of β2-adrenergic receptor homodimerization by Mercier et al. (19Mercier J.F. Salahpour A. Angers S. Breit A. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44925-44931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar) suggested that it is possible to estimate the proportion of receptors engaged in dimerization. Assuming a free equilibrium between donor and acceptor fusion proteins, only 50% of the dimers are expected to generate BRET if both partners are expressed at equimolar concentrations, because each partner can also generate 25% homodimers between identical molecules."

We report here that purified MukB introduces right-handed knots into DNA in the presence of type-2 topoisomerase, indicating that the protein promotes intramolecular DNA condensation. The pattern of generated knots suggests that MukB, similar to eukaryotic condensins, stabilizes large right-handed DNA loops. In contrast to eukaryotic condensins, however, the net supercoiling stabilized by MukB was negative. Furthermore, DNA reshaping by MukB did not require ATP. These data establish that bacterial condensins alter the shape of double-stranded DNA in vitro and lend support to the notions that the right-handed knotting is the most conserved biochemical property of condensins. Finally, we found that MukB can be eluted from a heparin column in two distinct forms, one of which is inert in DNA binding or reshaping. Furthermore, we find that the activity of MukB is reversibly attenuated during chromatographic separation. Thus, MukB has a unique set of topological properties, compared with other SMC proteins, and is likely to exist in two different conformations.

SMC (structural maintenance of chromosome) proteins are involved in various aspects of higher order chromatin dynamics in organisms ranging from bacteria to humans. They act as a part of multisubunit complexes that are required for such diverse cellular functions as chromosome cohesion and condensation, recombination, repair, and dosage compensation (1Swedlow J.R.

In solution, SMC proteins form a distinctive V-shaped structure composed of two molecules joined via their hinge domains (7Melby T.E. Ciampaglio C.N. Briscoe G. Erickson H.P. J.

The head domains themselves can dimerize, creating a composite ATP binding pocket at the interface of the two head domains. ATP binding and hydrolysis has been proposed to drive conformational changes in the interacting head domains, which eventually result in the formation and disruption of protein rings (10Hopfner K.P.

In eukaryotes, the structurally similar condensins and cohesins have very distinct roles in chromosome dynamics. In vitro, the purified SMCs act according to their intracellular functions. Condensins promote intramolecular DNA condensation, which can be detected as an increase in DNA knotting in the presence of type-2 topoisomerase (17Kimura K. Rybenkov V. Crisona N. Hirano T. Cozzarelli N. Cell. 1999; 98: 239-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 18Kimura K. Cuvier O. Hirano T. J. Biol.

Similar reaction carried out with cohesins produces catenanes, indicating that DNA fragments from different DNA molecules are brought together (20Losada A. Hirano T. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 268-272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Rad50 protein, an SMC protein involved in double strand break repair in yeast, oligomerizes upon binding to the ends of linear DNA (15de Jager M. van Noort J. van Gent D.C. Dekker C. Kanaar R. Wyman C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1129-1135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). The mechanism of DNA reshaping by SMC complexes remains unknown. It is not even clear how much of the biochemical specificity resides within the SMC core of the complex and how much is conferred by its non-SMC subunits. Perhaps the most comprehensive picture of DNA reshaping has been established for 13 S condensin from frogs (17Kimura K. Rybenkov V. Crisona N. Hirano T. Cozzarelli N. Cell. 1999; 98: 239-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). In a reaction coupled to DNA strand transport by type-2 topoisomerase, the five-subunit 13 S condensin promoted the ATP-dependent formation of chiral knots in nicked circular DNA. The majority of generated knots were right-handed trefoils, the three-noded knots. Five-noded torus knots and six-noded granny knots, which can be formed after two strand passages by topoisomerase, were also detected. Based on this knotting pattern, the authors suggested that 13 S condensin introduces right-handed loops into DNA (17Kimura K. Rybenkov V. Crisona N. Hirano T. Cozzarelli N. Cell. 1999; 98: 239-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Besides knotting, 13 S condensin promoted positive supercoiling of relaxed plasmids in the presence of type-1 topoisomerase (21Kimura K. Hirano T. Cell. 1997; 90: 625-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Both knotting and supercoiling are indicative of DNA compaction (1Swedlow J.R. Hirano T. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 557-569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 22Holmes V.F. Cozzarelli N.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1322-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), and thus it is not entirely clear which of the two reactions is primary in DNA condensation. Condensins from other organisms were reported to support either positive supercoiling (23Hagstrom K.A. Holmes V.F. Cozzarelli N.R. Meyer B.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 729-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) or knotting (18Kimura K. Cuvier O. Hirano T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5417-5420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) or knotting without concomitant supercoiling (19Stray J.E. Lindsley J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26238-26248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 24Stray J.E. Crisona N.J. Belotserkovskii B.P. Lindsley J.E. Cozzarelli N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34723-34734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The SMC protein from Bacillus subtilis has not been tested for knotting or supercoiling. Instead, the protein was reported to promote ATP-dependent aggregation of single-stranded DNA (25Hirano M. Hirano T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7139-7148Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This result is surprising, since condensins are believed to act on double-stranded DNA. It was interpreted therefore as an indication that B. subtilis SMC preferentially binds to negatively supercoiled DNA (25Hirano M. Hirano T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7139-7148Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 26Hirano M. Hirano T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5733-5744Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Here, we investigated DNA reshaping by the Escherichia coli SMC protein MukB. MukB is the first discovered member of the SMC protein family (27Niki H. Jaffe A. Imamura R. Ogura T. Hiraga S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 183-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Purified MukB forms a stable complex with double-stranded DNA and binds ATP and GTP in the presence of Zn2+ (28Niki H. Imamura R. Kitaoka M. Yamanaka K. Ogura T. Hiraga S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 5101-5109Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Inside the cell, MukB acts in a complex with two other, non-SMC proteins, MukE and MukF (29Yamanaka K. Ogura T. Niki H. Hiraga S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 250: 241-251PubMed Google Scholar, 30Yamazoe M. Onogi T. Sunako Y. Niki H. Yamanaka K. Ichimura T. Hiraga S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5873-5884Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Cells deficient in MukB function show chromosome decondensation and cutting and produce normal size anucleate cells (27Niki H. Jaffe A. Imamura R. Ogura T. Hiraga S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 183-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). The phenotype of mukB can be suppressed by mutations in DNA topoisomerases that increase DNA supercoiling (31Sawitzke J.A. Austin S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1671-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and thereby result in greater compactness of the chromosome. It was proposed therefore that MukBEF is a condensin (22Holmes V.F. Cozzarelli N.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1322-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 31Sawitzke J.A.

We report here that MukB promotes DNA knotting in the presence of type-2 topoisomerase. The pattern of generated knots, mostly right-handed trefoils, was similar to that found earlier for other condensins (17Kimura K. Rybenkov V. Crisona N. Hirano T. Cozzarelli N. Cell. 1999; 98: 239-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 18Kimura K. Cuvier O. Hirano T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5417-5420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 19Stray J.E. Lindsley J.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 2005; 280: 34723-34734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Thus, this aspect of DNA reshaping by condensins is highly conserved between the species. In contrast to eukaryotic condensins, however, the net supercoiling generated by MukB was negative. Furthermore, the topological activities of MukB did not require ATP. It appears, therefore, that MukB stabilizes DNA in a compact static structure that is prone to produce knots and supercoils upon treatment with topoisomerases. As an unexpected bonus, we find that MukB can be eluted from a heparin column as two peaks. The two eluted forms of MukB differ in DNA binding and reshaping and thus appear to represent two conformations of MukB. These two forms of MukB might correspond to different conformations of the protein during the chromosome condensation-decondensation cycle. Plasmids and Strains—The MukB-deficient strain GC7528 (27Niki H. Jaffe A. Imamura R. Ogura T. Hiraga S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 183-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) was a kind gift of Dr. Sota Hiraga. pBB10 is a pBAD/Myc-HisB (Invitrogen)-based plasmid that contains the mukB-His10 gene under the control of arabinose-inducible promoter PBAD. Protein Purification—Phage T2 topoisomerase was a generous gift of Dr. Nicholas R. Cozzarelli. Wheat germ topoisomerase I was purified as described (34Dynan W.S. Jendrisak J.J. Hager D.A. Burgess R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5860-5865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli topoisomerase I was purified by nickel-chelate chromatography using a polyhistidine tag cloned onto its C terminus. MukB-His10 was purified from DH5α cells harboring plasmid pBB10. The cells, grown in LB, were induced at A600 of 0.6 by the addition of 0.1% l-arabinose, collected by centrifugation 3 h later, resuspended in Buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.7, 300 mm NaCl, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) supplemented with 20 mm imidazole, and lysed using a French press. Clarified lysate was applied to nickel-charged His-Bind resin (Novagen), washed with 10 column volumes of Buffer A plus 20 mm imidazole and 6 volumes of Buffer A plus 125 mm imidazole, and eluted with 5 column volumes of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.7, 50 mm NaCl, 400 mm imidazole, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Eluted protein was supplemented with 2 mm EDTA and 1 mm DTT, 2The abbreviations used are: DTT, dithiothreitol; ACP, acyl carrier protein; AMPPNP, 5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate. applied to a heparin-agarose (Sigma) column, and washed with 5 volumes each of 1) Buffer B (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.7, 5% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) plus 50 mm NaCl, 400 mm imidazole and 2) Buffer B plus 50 mm NaCl. The protein was then eluted with a 10-volume gradient of 50–500 mm NaCl in Buffer B. The peak fractions were pooled; concentrated by dialysis against 20% polyethylene glycol 20000 in Buffer B plus 200 mm NaCl; dialyzed against 20 mm HEPES, 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 50% glycerol; and stored at –20 °C. Analytical fractionation of purified MukB was done using a 1-ml HiTrap heparin column (Amersham Biosciences). The fractions from the high and low salt peaks were pooled separately; dialyzed against 20 mm HEPES, 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 20% glycerol; and kept on ice for up to 2 weeks. Molecular Weight of MukB—The size of the purified MukB was measured using a combination of sucrose density gradient centrifugation and gel filtration chromatography. The size markers used for centrifugation and gel filtration were as follows: thyroglobulin (19.2 S, 8.6 nm), apoferritin (17.6 S, 6.2 nm), β-amylase (8.9 S, 4.8 nm), alcohol dehydrogenase (7.3 S, 4.6 nm), bovine serum albumin (4.3 S, 3.6 nm), and carbonic anhydrase (2.8 S). MukB migrated as a single peak on the sucrose gradient and Sephacryl S500 column (data not shown). The Stokes radius of MukB was estimated as 9.1 nm, and the sedimentation coefficient was 8.6 S (data not shown). These values are in very good agreement with the previous measurements performed for MukB in cell extracts (30Yamazoe M. Onogi T. Sunako Y. Niki H. Yamanaka K. Ichimura T. Hiraga S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5873-5884Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The molecular mass of MukB was calculated as 330 kDa, and the form factor was 2.0. Sucrose Density Gradient Centrifugation—30 μg of MukB was mixed with 30 μg each of thyroglobulin (Amersham Biosciences), apoferritin, β-amylase, yeast alcohol dehydrogenase, bovine serum albumin, and carbonic anhydrase (Sigma) in 20 mm HEPES, 200 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT. The protein mixture was layered on top of a 10–40% sucrose gradient atop a 70% sucrose cushion in the same buffer and centrifuged at 45,000 rpm at 4 °C for 12 h. DNA Reshaping—DNA knotting was done essentially as described in Ref. 17Kimura K. Rybenkov V. Crisona N. Hirano T. Cozzarelli N. Cell. 1999; 98: 239-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar. The indicated amounts of MukB were added to the mixture containing 10 ng (3.5 fmol) of singly nicked pBR322 DNA in 10 μl of Reaction Buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.7, 40 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 7% glycerol, 1 mm DTT) containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and, where indicated, 1 mm MgATP. The reaction mixture was supplemented with 3.5 fmol of phage T2 topoisomerase and incubated at 37 °C for 40 min. The reactions were quenched with Stop Buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5% SDS, 20 mm EDTA, 200 mm NaCl, 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K) plus 10 μg/ml yeast tRNA and incubated at 50 °C for 40 min. Following phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, the DNA samples were resolved using gel electrophoresis through 0.8% agarose gels in 0.75× TBE for 39 h at 3 V/cm. The DNA was then visualized using Southern blot hybridization and quantified using a Storm PhosphorImager. For the supercoiling reaction, 10 ng of relaxed pBR322 DNA was treated with either 35 fmol of wheat germ or E. coli topoisomerase I in the presence or absence of MukB in 10 μl of Reaction Buffer. Following deproteinization, the DNA was analyzed using gel electrophoresis through 0.8% agarose gels in 1× TAE (40 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.3, 1 mm EDTA) at 4 °C for 22 h at 3 V/cm followed by Southern blot hybridization. For the time course of DNA supercoiling, DNA topoisomerase was added prior to the addition of condensin. For gel shift experiments, 10 ng of DNA in Reaction Buffer was mixed with the indicated amounts of MukB and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction mixtures were then placed on ice and analyzed by gel electrophoresis through a 0.7% agarose gel in 89 mm Tris borate, pH 8.3, for 12 h (to resolve pBR322 DNA) or 2.5 h (for 443-bp DNA) at 4 V/cm at 4 °C. To visualize DNA, the gels were stained with SYBR Gold (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). ATPase Rate—1 μg of MukB was added to Reaction Buffer (10-μl final volume) supplemented with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1 mm MgATP, 0.1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and, where indicated, 200 ng of pBR322 or phage φX174 DNA. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C up to 1 h. 1-μl aliquots were removed every 20 min, mixed with 10 μl of Stop Buffer, incubated for 40 min at 50 °C, and resolved by thin layer chromatography using polyethyleneimine-cellulose plates (J. T. Baker Inc.). Two-dimensional Gel Elctrophoresis—DNA was first electrophoresed through a 1.1% agarose gel in 1× TAE for 22 h at 3 V/cm. The gel was then turned by 90°, soaked for 3 h in TAE supplemented with 0.8 μg/ml chloroquine, and further electrophoresed for 18 h at 2 V/cm. Electron Microscopy— 40 ng of singly nicked pBR322 DNA were incubated with 5.8 pmol of MukB in 20 μl under the same conditions that were used for the knotting assay. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 80 μl of Stop Buffer. Following deproteinization, we combined DNA from five separate reactions, denatured it in the presence of glyoxal, coated it with RecA protein in the absence of ATP, and examined it by electron microscopy as described in Ref. 35Zechiedrich E.L. Crisona N.J. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 94: 99-107PubMed Google Scholar. MukB Elutes from Heparin-Sepharose as Two Peaks—We initially purified MukB using the C-terminally placed His6 tag. That preparation of MukB, however, contained numerous contaminants, including nucleases. We therefore introduced the His10 C-terminal tag onto MukB. MukB-His10 fusion protein was overproduced from the pBB10 plasmid, which carries mukB-His10 under the control of the arabinose inducible promoter PBAD. The protein encoded on the plasmid was functionally active, since the plasmid suppressed the temperature sensitivity, anucleate cell formation and chromosome decondensation of mukB null mutant GC7528 (data not shown). Following purification by nickel-chelate chromatography, MukB was 95% pure. To make sure that no nucleic acids carried over with MukB, we next applied the protein to a heparin column (Heparin I). MukB eluted as a broad peak from this column (Fig. 1A). The high salt fractions of the peak (marked with the black bar in Fig. 1A) were pooled and analyzed further. The purified MukB was found to be a dimer (see “Materials and Methods”). Several additional species could be found in our main preparation of MukB (Fig. 1B). There was ∼3% acyl carrier protein (ACP), which translates into about 1 ACP per MukB dimer. The 8.8-kDa ACP migrates through SDS-PAGE with an anomalous mobility that depends on the length of the attached lipids (36de la Roche M.A. Shen Z. Byers D.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 344: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Copurification of ACP and MukB has been reported earlier (28Niki H. Imamura R. Kitaoka M. Yamanaka K. Ogura T. Hiraga S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 5101-5109Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 37Butland G. Peregrin-Alvarez J.M. Li J. Yang W. Yang X. Canadien V. Starostine A. Richards D. Beattie B. Krogan N. Davey M. Parkinson J. Greenblatt J. Emili A. Nature. 2005; 433: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). The significance of this interaction remains unknown. We also found several high molecular weight species that migrate more slowly than MukB on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1B, ×). These species are likely to be the cross-linked oligomers of MukB, since they appear equally abundant, about 2% of total protein, when visualized by Coomassie Blue staining and immunoblotting using anti-MukB antibody, and they are resistant to boiling in the presence of SDS and β-mercaptoethanol (Fig. 1B). The cross-linking most probably happened on the nickel column. Similar cross-linking has been reported earlier for other proteins (38Gill G. Richter-Rusli A.A. Ghosh M. Burrows C.J. Rokita S.E. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 302-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Two unidentified proteins, p30 and p24, were removed in the next round of heparin chromatography (Fig. 1C). These proteins comprised less than 1% of total protein and did not co-migrate with MukB or DNA reshaping activities during gel filtration or heparin chromatography (see below). Finally, we observed a variety of proteolytic fragments of MukB (marked P in Fig. 1B). The degradation of MukB was significantly less pronounced when the protein was coated with SDS at room temperature rather than at 100 °C (Fig. 1B). We detected no other contaminants in excess of 0.2% (Fig. 1B). MukB eluted as a broad peak from the first heparin column (Fig. 1A). This raised the possibility that MukB exists as a mixture of two different populations. We indeed found two separate peaks when we applied the Heparin I pool of MukB (black bar in Fig. 1A) to a HiTrap heparin column (Heparin II) and eluted it with a gradient of NaCl (Fig. 1, A and C). ACP copurified exclusively with the low salt fraction of MukB, indicating that the two peaks represent two different conformations of MukB. Furthermore, only one of the two protein populations was efficient in DNA reshaping (see below). The more active, high salt fraction of MukB was devoid of any detectable contaminants. This preparation (fractions 22–24 in Fig. 1C) was used below to characterize the topological activities of the protein. It was not immediately clear why the separation between the two peaks of MukB improved during the second run of the heparin column (Fig. 1A). Perhaps this difference can be attributed to the properties of heparin-agarose supplied by different manufacturers (see “Materials and Methods”). Alternatively, the variable elution of MukB could reflect conformational instability of the protein. In agreement with the latter interpretation, we again found two peaks (with similar partitioning between the high and low salt fractions) when we applied the low salt half of the Heparin I peak to the Heparin II column (data not shown). MukB Is a Slow ATPase—To characterize the ATPase activity of MukB, we used the Heparin I pool (black bar in Fig. 1A) of the protein that was additionally purified by gel filtration through Sephacryl S300. This additional purification step removed the contaminating ATPase activity from our main preparation of the protein (see below). MukB was a slow ATPase. At the optimal salt conditions, one dimer of MukB hydrolyzed 0.2 ATPs/min. This is perhaps the lowest ATPase rate reported so far for the SMC proteins and is comparable with that found for the Walker A mutants of SMCs (25Hirano M. Hirano T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7139-7148Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The ATPase activity of MukB declined at 10 mm MgCl2 and above 100 mm NaCl and was not affected by the presence of single-stranded or double-stranded DNA (Fig. 2). We found virtually the same rates of ATP hydrolysis when we further fractionated MukB into the high and low salt peaks using heparin chromatography (Fig. 2B). We again found no effect of DNA on the rates of ATP hydrolysis (data not shown). The salt conditions that resulted in the highest ATPase rate, 2 mm MgCl2, 40 mm NaCl, were selected to assay for DNA reshaping. MukB Binds Linear and Circular DNA—10 ng of DNA was incubated with increasing amounts of MukB in our standard reaction buffer (see “Materials and Methods”) for 30 min at 37 °C, the reactions were quenched by placing the tubes on ice, and the mixtures were resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis. The protein-bound DNA migrated as a smear through the gel, with the average mobility of the smear decreasing at higher concentrations of the protein (Fig. 3). The same gel shift pattern, at similar concentrations of the protein, was reported for MukB (28Niki H. Imamura R. Kitaoka M. Yamanaka K. Ogura T. Hiraga S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 5101-5109Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) and other SMC proteins (19Stray J.E. Lindsley J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26238-26248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 21Kimura K. Hirano T.

Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and is consistent with the view that numerous condensins bind the same DNA molecule. In agreement with this interpretation, discrete bands of gel-shifted DNA could often be observed at low protein concentration (Fig. 3, A and D). The high salt fraction of MukB was binding linear and circular DNA with similar affinities (Fig. 3A). Over several experiments, the difference in the apparent dissociation constants for binding to linear and circular, supercoiled pBR322 DNA was always less than a factor of 2 (data not shown). Such a small difference, if any, does not immediately support the topological entrapment mechanism proposed for cohesins (9Haering C.H. Lowe J. Hochwagen A. Nasmyth K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 773-788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). Rather, it can be readily explained by the higher local concentration of DNA segments next to each other typical for supercoiled DNA (40Vologodskii A.V. Cozzarelli N.R. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 2548-2556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the 10-fold shorter, 443-bp linear DNA required only 4-fold more MukB for complete gel shift (Fig. 3A). The low salt fraction of MukB showed similar DNA binding properties, albeit with a 3-fold lower affinity (Fig. 3B). The binding of MukB to either linear (data not shown) or supercoiled (Fig. 3C) DNA was not affected by the presence of ATP and was only marginally weakened when we replaced magnesium with EDTA in our reaction mixtures (Fig. 3C). Thus, neither ATP nor magnesium is required for DNA binding. Similar to the B. subtilis SMC protein (25Hirano M. Hirano T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7139-7148Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), MukB was binding to the phage single-stranded DNA much better than to double stranded DNA (Fig. 3D). However, we did not observe any gel shift for the 60-nucleotide single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides (data not shown). Thus, the high affinity of MukB for the phage DNA might reflect its interaction with the secondary st"
https://openalex.org/W1997321621,"Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) is a widely expressed Ser/Thr protein kinase that phosphorylates numerous substrates. This large number of substrates requires precise and specific regulation of GSK3 activity, which is achieved by a combination of phosphorylation, localization, and interactions with GSK3-binding proteins. Members of the Wnt canonical pathway have been shown to influence GSK3 activity. Through a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified the Wnt canonical pathway co-receptor protein low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6) as a GSK3-binding protein. The interaction between the C terminus of LRP6 and GSK3 was also confirmed by in vitro GST pull-down assays and in situ coimmunoprecipitation assays. In vitro assays using immunoprecipitated proteins demonstrated that the C terminus of LRP6 significantly attenuated the activity of GSK3β. In situ, LRP6 significantly decreased GSK3β-mediated phosphorylation of tau at both primed and unprimed sites. Finally, it was also demonstrated that GSK3β phosphorylates the PPP(S/T)P motifs in the C terminus of LRP6.

Jope R.S. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 65: 391-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (1319) Google Scholar). GSK3 is a unique Ser/Thr protein kinase that phosphorylates both primed (target Ser/Thr is 4 amino acids N-terminal to a prephosphorylated Ser/Thr) and unprimed (target Ser/Thr is flanked by a Pro) substrates (for a review, see Ref. 2Jope R.S. Johnson G.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 95-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1334) Google Scholar). A screen of a rat brain cDNA library revealed that GSK3 is encoded by two independent genes, GSK3α and GSK3β, with molecular masses of 51 and 47 kDa, respectively (3Woodgett J.R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2431-2438Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). The two genes display 85% overall sequence identity, which is even higher in the catalytic domain (93%). In the brain, although GSK3α mRNA level is higher than GSK3β, GSK3β protein level is higher (4Lau K.F. Miller C.C. Anderton B.H. Shaw P.C. J. Pept. Res. 1999; 54: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The poor relationship between transcription and translation in some tissues indicates that these two isoforms are subject to differential regulation, but little is known about the isoform-specific functions. More than 40 proteins have been reported to be phosphorylated by GSK3, including over a dozen transcription factors (reviewed in Ref. 2Jope R.S. Johnson G.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 95-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1334) Google Scholar). This large number of substrates illustrates the great potential of GSK3 to affect many cellular functions and suggests that the activity of GSK3 must be carefully regulated by individual mechanisms for each substrate. Although the mechanisms regulating GSK3 are not fully understood, precise control appears to be achieved by a combination of phosphorylation, localization, and interactions with GSK3-binding proteins (reviewed in Ref. 2Jope R.S. Johnson G.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 95-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1334) Google Scholar). Protein complexes that contain GSK3 are of major importance in regulating its actions. The best characterized of these complexes is involved in the Wnt canonical pathway, where GSK3-binding proteins control access to the GSK3 substrate, β-catenin, and generate a high degree of specificity in regulating the actions of GSK3. In the absence of Wnt signal, adenomatous polyposis coli, β-catenin, GSK3, casein kinase I (5Amit S. Hatzubai A. Birman Y. Andersen J.S. Ben-Shushan E. Mann M. Ben-Neriah Y. Alkalay I. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1066-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar), and other proteins all bind to the scaffold protein axin to form a complex (6Ikeda S. Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Murai H. Koyama S. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1371-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). In this complex, β-catenin is phosphorylated by casein kinase I and subsequently by GSK3, which allows the β-transducing repeat-containing protein, an F-box protein in the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, to bind and tag β-catenin for proteasome-mediated degradation (7Hart M. Concordet J.P. Lassot I. Albert I. del los Santos R. Durand H. Perret C. Rubinfeld B. Margottin F. Benarous R. Polakis P. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 207-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 8Li L. Yuan H. Weaver C.D. Mao J. Farr III, G.H. Sussman D.J. Jonkers J. Kimelman D. Wu D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4233-4240Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). When specific Wnts, such as Wnt 3a and Wnt 8, bind to the appropriate Frizzled (Fz) receptors, Dishevelled is activated; this, in concert with the GSK3-binding protein, frequently rearranged in advanced T-cell lymphoma (FRAT), facilitates disruption of the axin-based complex. This decreases the phosphorylation of β-catenin and results in β-catenin accumulation and activation (for a review, see Ref. 9Seidensticker M.J. Behrens J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1495: 168-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). This is a classical example of how GSK3-binding proteins can regulate the action of GSK3 toward individual substrates. In addition to the Fz receptors, Wnt canonical signaling requires single span transmembrane proteins that belong to a subfamily of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-related proteins (LRPs): vertebrate LRP5 and -6 and their Drosophila ortholog Arrow (10Pinson K.I. Brennan J. Monkley S. Avery B.J. Skarnes W.C. Nature. 2000; 407: 535-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar, 11Tamai K. Semenov M. Kato Y. Spokony R. Liu C. Katsuyama Y. Hess F.

DiNardo S. Nature. 2000; 407: 527-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). Unlike Fz, which is required for multiple Wnt pathways (13Veeman M.T. Axelrod J.D. Moon R.T. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 367-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1162) Google Scholar, 14Strutt D. Development. 2003; 130: 4501-4513Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), Arrow and LRP5/6 appear to be specifically required for Wnt/β-catenin signaling (12Wehrli M. Dougan S.T. Caldwell K.

He X. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 951-961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism for LRP5/6 involvement in Wnt signaling has not been fully elucidated, recent studies suggest that the C terminus of LRP5/6 binds to axin and localizes axin and other bound proteins of the destruction complex to the plasma membrane. This is followed by axin degradation and dispersal of proteins of the destruction complex (16Tamai K. Zeng X. Liu C. Zhang X. Harada Y. Chang Z. He X. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 149-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 17Mao J. Wang J. Liu B. Pan W. Farr III, G.H. Flynn C. Yuan H. Takada S. Kimelman D. Li L. Wu D. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 801-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a study demonstrated that a single PPP(S/T)P motif, which is reiterated five times in the LRP5/6/Arrow intracellular domain, can fully activate the Wnt pathway (16Tamai K. Zeng X. Liu C. Zhang X. Harada Y. Chang Z. He X. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 149-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Wnt signaling stimulates and requires phosphorylation of the PPP(S/T)P motif (16Tamai K. Zeng X. Liu C. Zhang X. Harada Y. Chang Z. He X. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 149-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), although it has not been determined which kinases and/or phosphatases are involved in this modification. Although this is the prevailing model for LRP5/6/Arrow function, it does not explain the observation that the intracellular domain alone of LRP5/6 can activate and potentiate the Wnt 3a-induced LEF-1 signal, although it is not membrane-anchored (18Mi K. Johnson G.V. J. Cell. Biochem. 2005; 95: 328-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Members of the Wnt canonical pathway have also been shown to influence GSK3 activity toward substrates outside of the pathway, with the microtubule-associated protein tau being a notable example (reviewed in Ref. 2Jope R.S. Johnson G.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 95-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1334) Google Scholar). Tau is phosphorylated by GSK3 at both unprimed and primed motifs. It has been demonstrated that primed phosphorylation of tau at Thr231 by GSK3 plays an essential role in decreasing the ability of tau to both bind and stabilize microtubules (19Cho J.H. Johnson G.V. J. Neurochem. 2004; 88: 349-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In contrast, GSK3-mediated phosphorylation of unprimed sites on tau (e.g. Ser396/404) may be more pathological and contribute to the formation of filamentous inclusions in Alzheimer disease and other neurodegenerative disorders (20Abraha A. Ghoshal N. Gamblin T.C. Cryns V. Berry R.W. Kuret J. Binder L.I. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3737-3745Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, our group demonstrated that axin potently inhibits tau phosphorylation by GSK3β, probably by sequestering GSK3β away from tau (21Stoothoff W.H. Bailey C.D. Mi K. Lin S.C. Johnson G.V. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 904-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Dishevelled has also been shown to decrease tau phosphorylation by GSK3β (22Mudher A. Chapman S. Richardson J. Asuni A. Gibb G. Pollard C. Killick R. Iqbal T. Raymond L. Varndell I. Sheppard P. Makoff A. Gower E. Soden P.E. Lewis P. Murphy M. Golde T.E. Rupniak H.T. Anderton B.H. Lovestone S. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 4987-4995Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), despite the fact that Dishevelled and GSK3β do not interact (8Li L. Yuan H. Weaver C.D. Mao J. Farr III, G.H. Sussman D.J. Jonkers J. Kimelman D. Wu D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4233-4240Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Interestingly, studies showed that FRAT-1 inhibits GSK3-mediated tau phosphorylation (23Thomas G.M. Frame S. Goedert M. Nathke I. Polakis P. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 458: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Further, antisense-induced knock-down of Dickkopf-1, a negative modulator of the Wnt pathway that functions through binding to the co-receptor LRP6 (24Mao B. Wu W. Li Y. Hoppe D. Stannek P. Glinka A. Niehrs C. Nature. 2001; 411: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar, 25Zorn A.M. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R592-R595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), attenuates the increased tau phosphorylation in β-amyloid peptide-treated neurons (26Caricasole A. Copani A. Caraci F. Aronica E. Rozemuller A.J. Caruso A. Storto M. Gaviraghi G. Terstappen G.C. Nicoletti F. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 6021-6027Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). However, whether LRP6 directly influences GSK3 activity has not been elucidated. Here we identify LRP6 as a GSK3-binding protein through a yeast two-hybrid assay. The interaction between LRP6 and GSK3 was confirmed by an in vitro GST pull-down assay and coimmunoprecipitation assays. The interaction of LRP6 with GSK3 significantly attenuated the activity of GSK3, and LRP6 was found to be a GSK3 substrate. Overall, this study suggests that LRP6 plays a unique and important role in and out of Wnt canonical signaling through regulating GSK3 activity. Cell Culture—Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were maintained in Ham’s F-12/Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Cellgro) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), 100 units/ml penicillin (Invitrogen), 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen), and 2 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen). Cells were grown in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Constructs and Recombinant Protein Preparation—The tau construct that does not contain exons 2 and 3 (T4) was described previously (27Huber A.H. Nelson W.J. Weis W.I. Cell. 1997; 90: 871-882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Human GSK3β-HA was a gift from Dr. J. R. Woodgett. The plasmid encoding glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion β-catenin in a bacterial expression vector was a gift from Dr. W. I. Weis (27Huber A.H. Nelson W.J. Weis W.I. Cell. 1997; 90: 871-882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). To make the GSK3α-HA construct, human brain mRNA (Clontech) was used as the template for RT-PCR of GSK3α (Superscript™ one-step reverse transcription-PCR (Invitrogen)). The following primers were used in the reaction: forward, 5′-GCG AAT TCC GTT ATG AGC GGC GGC GGG CCT TCG-3′; reverse, 5′-GCG AAT TCC AGC ACA CTG GCG GCC GTA-3′. The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and subcloned into the same vector as GSK3β-HA. The cytosolic fragment of the C terminus of human LRP6 (LRP6-C3) was described previously (18Mi K. Johnson G.V. J. Cell. Biochem. 2005; 95: 328-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Using LRP6-C3 in pCMV5A (18Mi K. Johnson G.V. J. Cell. Biochem. 2005; 95: 328-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) as a template, PCR was performed to subclone the LRP6-C3 fragment into corresponding vectors. The following primers were used for each PCR: forward (5′-CGC GGA TCC AGC ATG GGA CCA GCT TCT GTG CCT CTT GGT TAT GTG-3′) and reverse (5′-GCG CGT CGA CTT CTA GGA GGA GTC TGT ACA GGG AGA GGG TGG CGG TGG GT-3′) for subcloning LRP6-C3 into pGEX-6P-2 (Amersham Biosciences) (GST-LRP6-C3); forward (5′-CCG GAA TTC GGG ACC AGC TTC TGT GCC TCT TGG TTA TGT-3′) and reverse (5′-GGG ATC CTC AGG AGG AGT CTG TAC AGG GAG AG-3′) for subcloning LRP6-C3 into pEGFP-C1 (BD Biosciences) (GFP-LRP6-C3). The PCR products were digested and ligated into the corresponding cloning sites in vectors. For subcloning LRP6-C3 into pGBD-C1 vector (Clontech), LRP6-C3 was cut out from LRP6-C3 in pCMV5A by BamHI and SalI and ligated into the corresponding cloning sites in the vector. We also mutated all five PPP(S/T)P motifs in GST-LRP6-C3 to PPPAP to make GST-mut-LRP6-C3. The mutatgenesis reactions were carried out using either the GeneEditor™ in vitro site-directed mutagenesis system from Promega or the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. Plasmid integrity was verified using DNA sequencing analysis. GST-LRP6-C3, GST-mut-LRP6-C3, and GST-β-catenin were purified according to the manufacturer’s protocol, with the exception that cleared bacterial lysates were incubated with preblocked Fast Flow Glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h with rotation at 4 °C. For controls, GST was prepared in the same manner. For functional studies, GST-LRP6-C3 was treated on column with 60 units of Prescission protease (Amersham Biosciences) in cleavage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.0) overnight at 4 °C to remove the GST, and the LRP6-C3 was eluted. Where indicated, the fusion protein was left intact and eluted with glutathione buffer (20 mm Tris, 10 mm reduced glutathione, pH 8). After elution, GST-β-catenin, GST-LRP6-C3, GST-mut-LRP6-C3, and LRP6-C3 were dialyzed into phosphate-buffered saline. To determine the concentration of the purified protein, the samples were diluted in 2× SDS stop buffer (0.25 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2% SDS, 25 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue) and electrophoresed on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, in addition to aliquots containing known amounts of bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Fisher). The gel was Coomassie-stained, destained, and dried. The gel was scanned and quantitated using UNSCANIT software (Silk Scientific, Inc.), and the amount of recombinant protein in the sample was determined as a function of the BSA standards. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—The MATCHMAKER yeast two-hybrid system and an adult human brain cDNA library were purchased from Clontech. The bait for library screening was the intracellular domain of human LRP6 (residues 1416–1613), which was fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain by subcloning into the pGBD-C1 vector. The adult human brain cDNA library (Clontech) in the pGAD-C2 vector, which has a transcription activation domain, was used in the screen. Prior to the screening, the LRP6-C3 construct in the pGBD-C1 vector was first transformed into the Y190 yeast hosts (Clontech), and subsequently the yeast Y190 cells carrying LRP6-C3 were transformed with the human brain cDNA library using the lithium acetate/single-stranded carrier DNA/polyethylene glycol protocol (28Gietz R.D. Woods R.A. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 350: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (2097) Google Scholar). A small fraction of the transformation reaction was plated on synthetic dropout medium –Leu, –Trp, to estimate the total number of transformants. The remainder was plated on synthetic dropout medium –Leu, –Trp, –Ade to identify ADE2 reporter gene-positive colonies, which were subsequently transferred to synthetic dropout medium –Leu, –Trp, –His plates (Teknova) for further selection. Transient Transfections and Collection—CHO cells were transiently transfected using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were harvested in lysis buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 μm okadaic acid, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin). After sonication on ice for 10 s, cellular debris was removed by centrifugation. Protein concentrations of supernatants were then determined by the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce). Immunoblotting, Pull-down Assays, and Immunoprecipitation— Cells were collected as described above. After determination of protein concentrations, samples were diluted in 2× SDS buffer and electrophoresed on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Nitrocellulose membranes were blocked for 1 h with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) and then probed with antibody overnight at 4 °C. Blots were then rinsed with TBST, incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch) for 1 h at room temperature, rinsed with TBST, and developed with enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). To evaluate the phosphorylation state of tau, the following antibodies were used: AT180 (Pierce/Endogen), which recognizes tau phosphorylated on Thr231 (29Goedert M. Jakes R. Crowther R.A. Cohen P.

Cox T.M. Motter R. Brown J.P. Galasko D. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 430-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Levels of transfected GSK3 and GFP-LRP6-C3 were detected using monoclonal HA (Transduction Laboratories) and monoclonal GFP (Roche Applied Science) antibodies, respectively. The in vitro pull-down assay was carried out as described previously (36Bafico A. Gazit A. Wu-Morgan S.S. Yaniv A. Aaronson S.A. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2819-2825Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of GST- or GST-LRP6-C3-conjugated glutathione beads were incubated for 2 h with lysates from CHO cells transiently transfected with GSK3 and washed eight times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 350 mm NaCl (high salt) and 0.2% Triton X-100 prior to immunodetection by Western blotting. Alternatively, GST- or GST-LRP6-C3-conjugated beads were incubated with 200 ng of recombinant GSK3β (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) and washed in the same manner. For immunoprecipitation, 100 μg of the total lysate was diluted to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml and subjected to immunoprecipitation at 4 °C with preconjugated monoclonal anti-GFP antibody (Roche Applied Science) M-280 sheep anti-mouse magnetic IgG beads (Dynal Biotech) for 2 h on a rotational shaker. Precipitates were washed at least five times and boiled in 2× SDS stop buffer. The supernatants were collected, resolved on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and blotted as described above. Five micrograms of total protein of each condition were probed to check expression levels. GSK3 Activity Assays—Cell lysates were incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with magnetic IgG beads, which were precoupled with 1.5 μg of the monoclonal anti-GSK3β antibody (BD Biosciences) (to immunoprecipitate endogenous GSK3β) or with 1 μg of the monoclonal anti-GFP antibody (to immunoprecipitate GFP-LRP6-C3 and the associated GSK3β). After washing IgG beads containing the immunomobilized GSK3β four times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 350 mm NaCl (high salt) and 0.5% Nonidet P-40, the beads were washed two additional times with GSK3 kinase buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). GSK3β activity assays were performed as described using phosphoglycogen synthase peptide 2 or recombinant tau as substrates (37Stoothoff W.H. Cho J.H. McDonald R.P. Johnson G.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 270-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) with the exception that GSK3β activity was normalized to GSKβ levels in the sample, and the data were expressed as percentages of control (GFP alone). The same immunoprecipitation was performed to detect phospho-Ser9 GSK3β (Cell Signaling) in each condition. Recombinant in Vitro GSK3β Activity Assays—GST-β-catenin, purified as described above, was bound to washed glutathione beads for 4 h and washed twice with GSK3 kinase buffer. Sixty units of recombinant GSK3β (New England Biolabs) was preincubated with or without LRP6-C3 (cleaved from GST as described above) in the presence of 1 mg/ml BSA in GSK3 kinase buffer for 30 min at 4 °C. Preliminary experiments were conducted to determine optimal conditions for functional assay readouts, and a 40-fold molar excess of LRP6-C3 over GSK3β was used for all experiments. Following preincubation, reaction components were added to final concentrations of 125 μm ATP, 0.182 μCi/μl [γ-32P]ATP, and 1 mg/ml BSA in GSK3 kinase buffer. Washed GST-β-catenin bound to beads was then incubated in the reaction mix for 30 min at 30 °C. After removing the reaction supernatant and washing the beads twice with GSK3 kinase buffer, the beads were boiled with 30 μlof 2× SDS buffer, and the supernatants were resolved on an 8% polyacrylamide gel. The gels were dried and analyzed by phosphorimaging (Storm 840 (Amersham Biosciences) and ImageQuant software). GST-LRP6-C3 and GST-mut-LRP6-C3 in vitro phosphorylation by recombinant GSK3β was performed in a similar manner except that the purified GST-LRP6-C3 or GST-mut-LRP6-C3 was incubated with recombinant GSK3β alone without binding to the glutathione beads and without the addition of the BSA. For comparison, recombinant tau was incubated with recombinant GSK3β under identical conditions. Data Analysis—Data were analyzed using analysis of variance between individual groups. Values were considered significantly different when p was <0.05. Results were expressed as mean ± S.E. The C Terminus of LRP6 Directly Interacts with GSK3—Previous studies have shown that the Wnt canonical pathway co-receptors LRP5 and -6 can bind to axin and recruit it to the membrane, resulting in the degradation of axin and propagation of the Wnt signal (16Tamai K. Zeng X. Liu C. Zhang X. Harada Y. Chang Z. He X. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 149-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 17Mao J. Wang J. Liu B. Pan W. Farr III, G.H. Flynn C. Yuan H. Takada S. Kimelman D. Li L. Wu D. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 801-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). Although this is one mechanism by which LRP5/6 facilitates canonical Wnt signaling, our previous study showed that membrane targeting was not essential for the C terminus of LRP5/6 to constitutively activate the Wnt canonical pathway and synergistically increase LEF-1 activation in response to Wnt 3a (18Mi K. Johnson G.V. J. Cell. Biochem. 2005; 95: 328-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These findings suggested that LRP5/6 can facilitate the propagation of the Wnt signal through mechanisms other than recruitment of axin to the membrane. To determine which other proteins may be involved in the LRP5/6 signaling cascades, a yeast two-hybrid screen was carried out by using the intracellular domain of human LRP6 (LRP6-C3) as the bait, which was described previously (18Mi K. Johnson G.V. J. Cell. Biochem. 2005; 95: 328-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). An adult human brain cDNA library was used in the screen. We screened ∼2.5 million clones and identified four clones as GSK3 by nucleotide sequencing analyses. GSK3 interacted strongly with LRP6-C3 in yeast (Fig. 1). We also identified nine other unique clones, some of which are in the Wnt canonical pathway. However, none of them were axin. To confirm the interaction between LRP6-C3 and GSK3 in vitro, we made a GST-fused LRP6-C3 construct. Purified GST and a GST-LRP6-C3 fusion protein were conjugated to glutathione beads. CHO cells were transfected with GSK3α or GSK3β, and lysates from the transfected cells were incubated with GST- or GST-LRP6-C3-conjugated beads. Both GSK3α and GSK3β were specifically pulled down by LRP6-C3 in vitro (Fig. 2). To rule out an indirect interaction between LRP6-C3 and GSK3, a pull-down assay was performed using recombinant GSK3β and recombinant GST-LRP6-C3 (Fig. 2C), which confirmed a direct protein-protein interaction. Further co-immunoprecipitation assays also revealed that LRP6-C3 interacts directly with both GSK3α and GSK3β (Fig. 3).FIGURE 2The C terminus of LRP6 interacts with both GSK3α and GSKβ in vitro. CHO cells were collected 48 h after transfection with the indicated HA-tagged GSK3 constructs. 500 μg of the GSK3α cell lysates (A) or 200 μg of the GSK3β cell lysate (B) was incubated with GST or GST-LRP6-C3 proteins conjugated to glutathione beads for 2 h. Both GSK3α and GSK3β were specifically pulled down by LRP6-C3. Aliquots of the lysates (3 μg for GSK3α (A) and 4 μg for GSK3β (B)) were run in the first lane of each blot to show input. Blots were probed with an anti-HA antibody. C, GST- or GST-LRP6-C3-conjugated beads were incubated with 200 ng of recombinant GSK3β (rGSK3β), washed, and blotted with a GSK3β antibody.

https://openalex.org/W2034274268,"Native disulfide bond formation in eukaryotes is dependent on protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI) and its homologs, which contain varying combinations of catalytically active and inactive thioredoxin domains. However, the specific contribution of PDI to the formation of new disulfides versus reduction/rearrangement of non-native disulfides is poorly understood. We analyzed the role of individual PDI domains in disulfide bond formation in a reaction driven by their natural oxidant, Ero1p. We found that Ero1p oxidizes the isolated PDI catalytic thioredoxin domains, A and A′ at the same rate. In contrast, we found that in the context of full-length PDI, there is an asymmetry in the rate of oxidation of the two active sites. This asymmetry is the result of a dual effect: an enhanced rate of oxidation of the second catalytic (A′) domain and the substrate-mediated inhibition of oxidation of the first catalytic (A) domain. The specific order of thioredoxin domains in PDI is important in establishing the asymmetry in the rate of oxidation of the two active sites thus allowing A and A′, two thioredoxin domains that are similar in sequence and structure, to serve opposing functional roles as a disulfide isomerase and disulfide oxidase, respectively. These findings reveal how native disulfide folding is accomplished in the endoplasmic reticulum and provide a context for understanding the proliferation of PDI homologs with combinatorial arrangements of thioredoxin domains.

These findings reveal how native disulfide folding is accomplished in the endoplasmic reticulum and provide a context for understanding the proliferation of PDI homologs with combinatorial arrangements of thioredoxin domains. Proteins that traverse the secretory pathway typically contain disulfide bonds that are critical for their correct fold and function. In eukaryotes, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 2The abbreviations used are: ERendoplasmic reticulumPDIprotein-disulfide isomeraseGuHClguanidine hydrochlorideAMS4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′ disulfonic acidCPYcarboxypeptidase Y. is the entry point into the secretory pathway and is the cellular compartment where folding and disulfide bond formation occur (1Sevier C.S. Kaiser C.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 836-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar, 2Tu B.P. Weissman J.S. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). Disulfides can form spontaneously in vitro in the presence of an oxidizing agent such as molecular oxygen or oxidized glutathione; however, this process is typically slow and inefficient. In vivo, disulfide bond formation is dependent on cellular machinery to catalyze the formation of new disulfides (oxidation) and the rearrangement of non-native disulfides (isomerization). Both oxidation and isomerization are necessary for allowing the full complement of native disulfide bond formation. endoplasmic reticulum protein-disulfide isomerase guanidine hydrochloride 4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′ disulfonic acid carboxypeptidase Y. Protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI), which was identified more than 40 years ago, plays a critical role in promoting native disulfide bond formation in vivo (3Goldberger R.F. Epstein C.J. Anfinsen C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 628-635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PDI, an essential enzyme with the ability to catalyze both the oxidation of new disulfides and the isomerization of existing disulfides, is composed of four thioredoxin-like domains (4Freedman R.B. Klappa P. Ruddock L.W. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 136-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The first and last domains (referred to as A and A′, respectively) contain Cys-x-x-Cys (CxxC) active sites, whereas the two middle domains (referred to as B and B′) are catalytically inactive (5Farquhar R. Honey N. Murant S.J. Bossier P. Schultz L. Montgomery D. Ellis R.W. Freedman R.B. Tuite M.F. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 6Kemmink J. Darby N.J. Dijkstra K. Nilges M. Creighton T.E. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 239-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Oxidation involves the transfer of an active site disulfide from PDI to substrate proteins, while isomerization requires the active site cysteines to be in a reduced form so that they can attack non-native disulfides in substrate proteins thereby catalyzing their rearrangement. Thus, oxidation and isomerization have opposing requirements for the redox state of PDI. Analyses of the cellular role of PDI have led to a conflicting picture about whether it functions primarily as an isomerase or an oxidase. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a PDI mutant in which the second active-site cysteine in both of the catalytic domains is replaced with serine (CxxS-CxxS) is able to restore viability to a Δpdi1 strain (7Laboissiere M.C. Sturley S.L. Raines R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28006-28009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Since isomerization only requires one cysteine per active site, this implies that the isomerase activity of PDI is essential. However, in S. cerevisiae, the inactivation of PDI leads to a dramatic defect in the de novo formation of disulfide bonds in newly synthesized proteins (8Frand A.R. Kaiser C.A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 469-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). This suggests that PDI also plays an important role in catalyzing disulfide oxidation. The picture is further complicated by the existence of four other yeast PDI homologs in the ER: Mpd1p, Mpd2p, Eug1p, and Eps1p (9Tachibana C. Stevens T.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4601-4611Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 10Wang Q. Chang A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5972-5982Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 11Tachikawa H. Takeuchi Y. Funahashi W.

Katoh S. Gao X.D. Mizunaga T. Fujimoto D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 710-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The PDI family is even larger in metazoans and now includes at least 17 different human proteins (13Ellgaard L. Ruddock L.W. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). These homologs possess varying combinations of catalytic and non-catalytic thioredoxin domains as well as additional trans-membrane and chaperone domains. In general, it is poorly understood what contribution these complicated domain architectures make given that the thioredoxin domain is the basic catalytic unit. One possibility is that the specific domain combinations dictate the interactions between a PDI homolog and other ER-resident chaperones to define a subset of folding substrates. A well studied example of this is the human protein, ERp57, which acts in concert with the ER lectin chaperones, calreticulin and calnexin, to specifically aid in the folding of glycosylated substrates (14Oliver J.D. van der Wal F.J. Bulleid N.J. High S. Science. 1997; 275: 86-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 15Oliver J.D. Roderick H.L. Llewellyn D.H. High S. Mol. Biol.

Another possibility is that the different domain combinations may dictate distinct redox functions for the PDI homologs. Many studies have explored the functional differences among PDI homologs by examining the redox properties of the different thioredoxin catalytic domains (reviewed in Ref. 1Sevier C.S. Kaiser C.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 836-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). These studies have typically focused on measurements of redox potentials using small molecule thiol agents such as glutathione. The redox potential of a thioredoxin domain can be used successfully to distinguish between the more strongly reducing cytosolic thioredoxin domains and the ER localized PDI family members (17Mossner E. Huber-Wunderlich M. Glockshuber R. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1233-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). However, recent studies have shown that disulfide bond formation occurs independently of glutathione both in vivo (18Cuozzo J.W. Kaiser C.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 130-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) and in vitro (19Tu B.P. Ho-Schleyer S.C. Travers K.J. Weissman J.S. Science. 2000; 290: 1571-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). In vivo, the redox state of PDI is determined by its interaction with Ero1p rather than by equilibrium with the bulk glutathione redox buffer in the ER (8Frand A.R. Kaiser C.A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 469-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Ero1p is an essential and evolutionarily conserved protein that generates disulfides in a flavin-dependent reaction that consumes molecular oxygen (Fig. 1) (19Tu B.P. Ho-Schleyer S.C. Travers K.J.

Instead, Ero1p specifically oxidizes PDI which in turn passes the oxidizing equivalents to substrates (Fig. 1) (8Frand A.R. Kaiser C.A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 469-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 19Tu B.P. Ho-Schleyer S.C. Travers K.J. Weissman J.S. Science. 2000; 290: 1571-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Thus, to understand the specific cellular role of PDI and its homologs, we have to establish whether and how these proteins interact with Ero1p. In the present study, we systematically explore the contribution of PDI to native disulfide bond formation in a reaction driven by Ero1p. Taking advantage of the reconstitution of the Ero1p pathway (19Tu B.P. Ho-Schleyer S.C. Travers K.J. Weissman J.S. Science. 2000; 290: 1571-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), we show that there is an asymmetry in the rate of oxidation of the two PDI catalytic domains that allows it to function as a dual disulfide oxidase/isomerase. We also demonstrate that this asymmetry results from a combination of two effects: first, the enhanced rate of oxidation of the A′ domain in the context of the full-length protein and second, the substrate-mediated inhibition of oxidation of the A domain. We further establish that the asymmetry is not intrinsic to the individual catalytic domains and rather the specific order of thioredoxin domains in PDI is critical for the functional asymmetry in its active sites.

ACxxCA′AxxA was generated by the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) of the second active site of the PDI expression vector pBT101.

All of the generated plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing. All the constructs are N-terminally His tagged and were purified over a nickel column as described previously (19Tu B.P.

Ho-Schleyer S.C. Travers K.J. Weissman J.S. Science. 2000; 290: 1571-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The folding reactions were initiated by addition of reduced RNase A and reduced PDI or ERp57 to Ero1p and 20 μm FAD in a final reaction buffer (100 mm Tris acetate (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA). At the indicated time points, free thiols were blocked by the addition of SDS loading buffer and 10 mm AMS (4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′ disulfonic acid, Molecular Probes). The oxidized and reduced forms of RNase A were detected by Coomassie staining after separation by non-reducing SDS-PAGE. RNase A Activity Assay—RNase A activity was assayed by the hydrolysis of cCMP (Sigma) (19Tu B.P. Ho-Schleyer S.C. Travers K.J. Weissman J.S. Science. 2000; 290: 1571-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Reduced RNase A (20 μm) was added to a reaction containing the indicated concentrations of Ero1p, reduced PDI or ERp57, FAD (100 μm), and cCMP (18 mm) in a buffer containing 100 mm Tris acetate (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.005% digitonin. RNase A activity was monitored by the change in absorbance at 296 nm at 25 °C using an absorbance plate reader (Molecular Devices). Fluorescence Assay of PDI Oxidation—Oxidation of PDI was monitored using the dye ThioGlo1 (Covalent Associates, Inc.). ThioGlo1 is a multimode derivative of naphthopyranone that has little background fluorescence (27Wright S.K. Viola R.E. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 265: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). It reacts rapidly with free thiols to give a fluorescent product and can be used to detect protein thiol concentrations as low as 10 nm (27Wright S.K. Viola R.E. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 265: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The reactions are monitored using a fluorescence plate reader (Molecular Devices) with the excitation wavelength set at 379 nm and the emission measured at 510 nm. PDI was reduced using 10 mm dithiothreitol and buffer exchanged using a Centri-Sep spun column (Princeton Separations) into 100 mm Tris acetate (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA. Reactions were started by the addition of reduced PDI to the indicated concentration of Ero1p and FAD (20 μm). For measurements of the oxidation rate in the presence of RNase A, reactions were started by the addition of reduced PDI and reduced RNase A to Ero1p and FAD (20 μm) at the indicated concentrations. The final reaction buffer contained 100 mm Tris acetate (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA. The disulfide content was analyzed at the indicated time points by the addition of 6 m GuHCl, 1× phosphate-buffered saline, and 25 μm ThioGlo1. The samples were incubated for 10 min and analyzed by fluorescence. The initial rate of oxidation was calculated as the slope of the linear decrease in fluorescence over time. The assay with ERp57 was done following the same protocol. RNase A Protection Assay—To prepare reduced and alkylated RNase A, 10 mg of protein was reduced in 1 ml of 6 m GuHCl, 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 10 mm DTT. RNase A was reduced for 30 min at 37 °C and iodoacetamide (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 80 mm. The protein was incubated in the dark for another 30 min at 37 °C. The sample was then desalted using a Centri-Sep spin column into 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.0) and 50 mm NaCl and protein concentration was determined by A280 in 6 m GuHCl. Blocked RNase A (200 μm) was added to the reaction mixture with reduced PDI or ERp57, Ero1p (0.3 μm), and FAD (20 μm). The rate of oxidation was compared in the presence or absence of alkylated RNase A. Both the PDI Active Site Mutants Have Large Defects in Promoting RNase A Refolding—The individual contributions of the two yeast PDI active sites to Ero1p-mediated disulfide bond formation are poorly characterized. To dissect their roles, we made two active site mutants in which the pair of active site cysteines in the first (AAxxAA′CxxC) and last (ACxxCA′AxxA) thioredoxin domains was mutated to a pair of alanines (Fig. 2A). We characterized the activity of these mutants by reconstituting the complete Ero1p pathway using purified Ero1p, PDI, FAD, and the folding substrate RNase A (19Tu B.P. Ho-Schleyer S.C. Travers K.J. Weissman J.S. Science. 2000; 290: 1571-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). RNase A is a well characterized substrate that depends on the correct formation of four disulfide bonds for folding and activity (28Lyles M.M. Gilbert H.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 613-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). We followed native disulfide bond formation in refolding RNase A by monitoring its activity using the artificial substrate cCMP. We found that both AAxxAA′CxxC and ACxxCA′AxxA have large defects in promoting RNase A folding when compared with wild-type PDI under conditions in which the number of active sites are matched (Fig. 2B). In principle, the discrepancies in the abilities of the active site mutants to refold RNase A could result from a defect in either disulfide oxidation or isomerization. To help differentiate between these possibilities, we directly tested the ability of the two active site mutants to support disulfide formation by using an assay that, unlike the activity assay, does not distinguish between native and non-native disulfides. We followed the oxidation of RNase A at the defined reaction times by blocking free thiols with AMS, which adds 0.5 kDa for each free sulfydryl group (19Tu B.P. Ho-Schleyer S.C. Travers K.J. Weissman J.S. Science. 2000; 290: 1571-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The oxidation state of RNase A can then be monitored using SDS-PAGE. We found that for ACxxCA′AxxA, oxidation is compromised and accordingly, it has a marked defect in refolding native RNase A (Fig. 2, B and C). In contrast, AAxxAA′CxxC and wild-type PDI have a similar ability to catalyze RNase A oxidation (Fig. 2C). Therefore, in comparing AAxxAA′CxxC and wild-type PDI, there is discordance between their rate of disulfide formation and the yield of native RNase A (Fig. 2, B and C). The PDI Active Sites Have Distinct Roles; the A Domain Is Mainly an Isomerase, while the A′ Domain Is an Efficient Oxidase—To dissect the contributions of the individual active sites to the activity of wild-type PDI, we quantified the initial rates of disulfide bond formation using a dye, ThioGlo1, which reacts rapidly with free thiols to give a fluorescent product (27Wright S.K. Viola R.E. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 265: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). We found that at 3 μm, the N-terminal active site (ACxxCA′AxxA) has over a 4-fold defect in the initial rate of oxidation when compared with wild-type PDI (Fig. 3A). In contrast, as we saw previously AAxxAA′CxxC has a rate of oxidation that is close to that of wild-type PDI, and when the Ero1p concentration is increased modestly (1.3-fold), the initial rates of oxidation can be matched (Fig. 3A). However, even under conditions in which the rate of disulfide formation is matched, we found that AAxxAA′CxxC has a much lower yield of functional RNase A than wild-type PDI (Fig. 3B). Since rearrangement of incorrect disulfides is a rate-limiting step in refolding RNase A, the failure of AAxxAA′CxxC to refold RNase A may be due to a defect in isomerization (29Shin H.C. Scheraga H.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 995-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Additionally, the presence of the N-terminal active site contributes significantly to the activity of wild-type PDI even though it is a poor oxidase, arguing that the N-terminal active site functions as an isomerase. To determine whether the two active sites are functionally distinct, we tested the possibility that ACxxCA′AxxA can act in trans with AAxxAA′CxxC to overcome its marked defect in refolding RNase A (Fig. 3C). Indeed, we found that ACxxCA′AxxA can complement AAxxAA′CxxC in trans even when ACxxCA′AxxA is added well after the oxidation reaction is initiated. The rapid increase in the rate of RNase A refolding seen upon ACxxCA′AxxA addition to pre-oxidized RNase A indicates that it promotes the conversion of non-native disulfides to the native form. Together, AAxxAA′CxxC and ACxxCA′AxxA can match the yield of refolded RNase A by wild-type PDI (Fig. 3C). Thus, we find that there is a functional asymmetry in the PDI active sites with the C-terminal active site acting primarily as an oxidase, while the N-terminal active site acts as an isomerase. Mechanism of Asymmetry in the PDI Active Sites; the N-terminal Active Site Is Oxidized More Slowly than the C-terminal Active Site—What is the mechanistic basis of the functional asymmetry in the PDI active sites? A previous study has suggested that Ero1p cannot oxidize the N-terminal active site of PDI (30Tsai B. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 207-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). However, Ero1p was used under conditions in which it was compromised because no additional FAD was present in the reaction, which is known to be required for its activity (19Tu B.P. Ho-Schleyer S.C. Travers K.J. Weissman J.S. Science. 2000; 290: 1571-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 22Gross E. Kastner D.B. Kaiser C.A. Fass D.

Additionally, the activity reported was under conditions in which Ero1p was in large excess over PDI (10:1), in contrast to the multiple turnovers that we typically monitor using substoichiometric Ero1p. For these reasons, we systematically explored the ability of Ero1p to oxidize the PDI active sites and analyzed the minimal requirements for recognition by Ero1p. We used the ThioGlo1 fluorescence assay to establish conditions in which the initial rate of oxidation of PDI is linearly dependent on its concentration and the relative rate of oxidation of the PDI active sites can be compared (Fig. 4A). Our data indicate that Ero1p is able to oxidize both PDI active sites and, as seen previously, there is negligible oxidation in the absence of additional FAD (Fig. 4B) (19Tu B.P. Ho-Schleyer S.C. Travers K.J. Weissman J.S. Science. 2000; 290: 1571-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Since ACxxCA′AxxA appeared to be oxidized more slowly than AAxxAA′CxxC, we compared their initial rates of oxidation and found that there is a 2-fold disparity in the ability of Ero1p to oxidize the two active sites (Fig. 4C). Additionally, we found that the sum of the initial rates of oxidation of ACxxCA′AxxA and AAxxAA′CxxC is equal to the rate of oxidation of PDI strongly suggesting that the two domains are oxidized independently (Fig. 4C). We also compared the initial rate of oxidation of a series of PDI domain truncations to identify the minimal requirement for functional interaction with Ero1p. We found that Ero1p is able to oxidize the isolated A′ domain indicating that a single thioredoxin domain is sufficient for recognition. However, the rate of oxidation of the A′ domain is half that of AAxxAA′CxxC indicating that the enhanced rate of oxidation of the A′ domain in the full-length protein is contingent on the presence of the A domain (Fig. 4C). Additionally, the rates of oxidation of BB′A′, B′A′ and A′ are the same, demonstrating that the loss of either the B or B′ domain does not affect the interaction with Ero1p (Fig. 4C). Also, there is no difference in the rate of oxidation of the N- and C-terminal active sites in the PDI truncation mutants (A versus A′). This is in contrast to the 2-fold disparity between the rate of oxidation of the N- and C-terminal active sites in the PDI mutants, ACxxCA′AxxA and AAxxAA′CxxC. Thus, we show that the fundamental unit of recognition is the thioredoxin domain as Ero1p can oxidize the isolated A and A′ domains. Our results additionally highlight the role of the thioredoxin domain architecture in establishing asymmetry in the PDI active sites, since the enhanced rate of oxidation of the A′ domain is only apparent in the context of the full-length AAxxAA′CxxC. Substrate Inhibits Ero1-mediated Oxidation of the N-terminal Active Site—Although the intrinsic difference in the rate of oxidation of the PDI active sites by Ero1p may contribute to their functional asymmetry, this 2-fold disparity in the rate of oxidation of the two active sites is not sufficient to fully explain the difference in their ability to oxidize RNase A. For this reason, we explored the possibility that substrate binding to PDI might play a more active role in altering the rate of Ero1p-mediated oxidation. The substrate can affect the rate of the reaction in two ways; first, it is a source of reductant for PDI, and second, it is an unfolded protein that binds to PDI and may alter the ability of Ero1p to interact with PDI. To specifically focus on the effects of substrate binding in the absence of catalysis, we took advantage of the fact that the interaction between PDI and folding substrates can occur in the absence of substrate disulfides (31Klappa P. Ruddock L.W. Darby N.J. Freedman R.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 927-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) and measured the rate of oxidation of PDI in the presence of reduced and alkylated RNase A. We found that substrate binding specifically protects the first thioredoxin domain from oxidation by Ero1p. The rate of oxidation of ACxxCA′AxxA decreases to 40 ± 4% in the presence of alkylated RNase A (Fig. 5A). In contrast, the rate of oxidation of AAxxAA′CxxC is not altered significantly in the presence of this substrate. The effect of substrate binding on the rate of oxidation of wild-type PDI is intermediate (70 ± 9%), which is consistent with its altering the oxidation of the first but not the second active site. Furthermore, we found that the addition of alkylated RNase A does not inhibit the oxidation of the N-terminal active site in the PDI mutant, AB (Fig. 5A). Therefore, the B′A′ domains, which have been shown previously to be required for substrate binding, are required for this effect (31Klappa P. Ruddock L.W. Darby N.J. Freedman R.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 927-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Thus, the substrate-mediated protection of the N-terminal active site magnifies the intrinsic difference in rate of oxidation of the PDI active sites and further contributes to the asymmetry in their function. It remains to be explored whether the substrate-mediated protection of the A domain results from a direct competition between substrate and Ero1p for PDI recognition (Fig. 5B). Alternately, substrate binding could also induce a conformational change in PDI preventing access of Ero1p to the A domain.

https://openalex.org/W2071184823,"AIF is a main mediator of caspase-independent cell death. It is encoded by a single gene located on chromosome X, region q25–26 and A6 in humans and mice, respectively. Previous studies established that AIF codes for two isoforms of the protein, AIF and AIF-exB. Here, we identify a third AIF isoform resulting from an alternate transcriptional start site located at intron 9 of AIF. The resulting mRNA encodes a cytosolic protein that corresponds to the C-terminal domain of AIF (amino acids 353–613). We named this new isoform AIFshort (AIFsh). AIFsh overexpression in HeLa cells results in nuclear translocation and caspase-independent cell death. Once in the nucleus, AIFsh provokes the same effects than AIF, namely chromatin condensation and large scale (50 kb) DNA fragmentation. In contrast, these apoptogenic effects are not precluded by the AIF-inhibiting protein Hsp70. These findings identify AIFsh as a new pro-apoptotic isoform of AIF, and also reveal that the first N-terminal 352 amino acids of AIF are not required for its apoptotic activity. In addition, we demonstrate that AIFsh is strongly down-regulated in tumor cells derived from kidney, vulva, skin, thyroid, and pancreas, whereas, γ-irradiation treatment provokes AIFsh up-regulation. Overall, our results identify a novel member of the AIF-dependent pathway and shed new light on the role of caspase-independent cell death in tumor formation/suppression.

Harrington Jr., W.J. Semin. Arthritis Rheum. 2003; 32: 345-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Aberrations in apoptosis signaling pathways result in a variety of pathological conditions and are common in cancer cells (2Brown J.M. Attardi L.D. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 231-237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, cellular changes leading to inhibition of apoptosis play an essential role in tumor development (3Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21926) Google Scholar, 4Thompson C.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6174) Google Scholar). The elucidation of the apoptotic pathways is thus an important area of study that may provide insights into the causes of drug resistance and facilitate the development of novel anticancer therapies.In the last decade, the study of PCD focused on caspases, a family of cysteine proteases specifically activated in apoptotic cells. Because the induction of apoptosis through the use of caspase activators may theoretically constitute a treatment for cancer (5Hu W. Kavanagh J.J. Lancet Oncol. 2003; 4: 721-729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar), the initial pro-apoptotic anticancer trials have focused on caspase activity (6Blagosklonny M.V. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2967-2975Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, most of these studies are still in preclinical development because of their low efficacy. In part, this may be because of the fact that programmed cell death can proceed even when the caspase cascade is blocked (7Susin S.A. Daugas E. Ravagnan L. Samejima K. Zamzami N. Loeffler M. Costantini P. Ferri K.F. Irinopoulou T. Prevost M.C. Brothers G. Mak T.W. Penninger J. Earnshaw W.C. Kroemer G. J. Exp.

Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2746-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). This fact has revealed the existence of alternative pathway(s) defined as caspase-independent (8Jaattela M. Ann. Med. 2002; 34: 480-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar).Apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) was the first identified protein involved in caspase-independent cell death (10Susin S.A. Lorenzo H.K. Zamzami N. Marzo I. Snow B.E. Brothers G.M. Mangion J. Jacotot E. Costantini P. Loeffler M. Larochette N. Goodlett D.R. Aebersold R. Siderovski D.P. Penninger J.M. Kroemer G. Nature. 1999; 397: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (3431) Google Scholar). AIF is expressed as a precursor of 67 kDa, which is addressed and compartmentalized into mitochondria by two mitochondrial localization sequences (MLS) located within the N-terminal prodomain of the protein. Once in the mitochondria, this prodomain is removed, giving rise to a mature form of ∼57 kDa (10Susin S.A. Lorenzo H.K. Zamzami N. Marzo I. Snow B.E. Brothers G.M. Mangion J. Jacotot E. Costantini P.

Nagaura Z. Ishihara N. Mihara K. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1375-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). This form comprises three structural domains: FAD-binding domain, NADH-binding domain, and C-terminal domain (12Lorenzo H.K. Susin S.A. FEBS Lett. 2004; 557: 14-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The oxidoreductase part of AIF (composed by both NADH- and FAD-binding domains) confers an electron transfer activity to the protein (13Miramar M.D. Costantini P. Ravagnan L. Saraiva L.M. Haouzi D.

Under physiological conditions, AIF is a mitochondrial FAD-dependent oxidoreductase that plays a role in oxidative phosphorylation (14Vahsen N. Cande C. Briere J.J. Benit P. Joza N. Larochette N.

EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4679-4689Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Thus, AIF has a protective function in some cell types (15Klein J.A. Longo-Guess C.M. Rossmann M.P. Seburn K.L. Hurd R.E.

However, after a cellular insult, AIF is cleaved by calpains and/or cathepsins (11Otera H. Ohsakaya S. Nagaura Z. Ishihara N. Mihara K.

On the other hand, in human colon cancer cells, AIF suppresses chemical stress-induced apoptosis and maintains the transformed state of tumor cells (32Urbano A. Lakshmanan U. Choo P.H. Kwan J.C.

All these data illustrate the role of AIF and the caspase-independent death pathway in the control of PCD.AIF, located on chromosome X, consists of 16 exons (10Susin S.A. Lorenzo H.K. Zamzami N. Marzo I. Snow B.E. Brothers G.M. Mangion J. Jacotot E. Costantini P. Loeffler M. Larochette N. Goodlett D.R. Aebersold R. Siderovski D.P. Penninger J.M. Kroemer G. Nature. 1999; 397: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (3431) Google Scholar). Previous work revealed that AIF codes for two isoforms (AIF and AIF-exB) characterized by an alternative use of exon 2 or exon 2b (33Loeffler M. Daugas E. Susin S.A. Zamzami N. Metivier D. Nieminen A.L. Brothers G. Penninger J.M. Kroemer G. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 758-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). However, a detailed study allowed us to identify a novel AIF transcript present in human and mouse tissues. This novel transcript, called AIFshort (AIFsh), comprises 7 exons derived from exon 10 to 16 of AIF. The resulting protein corresponds to the C-terminal part of AIF, lacking its N-terminal domain. AIFsh provokes caspase-independent cell death, indicating that the pro-apoptotic activity of AIF resides in its C-terminal domain. In addition, we explored the potential role of this new pro-apoptotic AIF isoform in tumor formation/suppression and showed that AIFsh mRNA is down-regulated in tumor cells but is transcriptionally up-regulated by γ-irradiation.MATERIALS AND METHODSRapid Amplification of cDNA End (RACE) Analysis—5′- and 3′-RACE were performed using Marathon-Ready cDNA from human kidney (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. In short, for the 5′-RACE, 2 μl of a cDNA sample were subjected to the first round of PCR amplification using the adaptor primer 1 and the antisense primer HCR1 (Table 1). For the 3′-RACE, the first round of PCR was performed using the adaptor primer 1 and the sense primer I9F (Table 1). After amplification for 30 cycles (94 °C, 20 s; 66 °C, 30 s; and 72 °C, 3 min), 1 μl of this PCR was reamplified for 30 cycles using the same reaction conditions with nested primer adaptor primer 2 and the nested antisense primer HAIFshR for 5′-RACE. For the 3′-RACE, nested sense primer was E10F (Table 1). The PCR amplimers were synthesized with Herculase Enhanced DNA Polymerase (Stratagene, San Diego, CA) and, finally, the PCR products were cloned in the pCR® 4-TOPO® vector (Invitrogen, Cergy Pontoise, France) and sequenced on an ABI Prism 310 capillary sequencer (Applied Biosystem, Foster City, CA).TABLE 1Primers and probes used in the study Primers and probes for RACE, RT-PCR, Northern, and cancer array experiments were used as described under “Materials and Methods.”Primer/ProbeaPrimer/Probe, name of the primer or probeSequencebSequence, nucleotidic sequence of the indicated primerPositioncPosition, exon or intron of AIF containing the primerSensedSense, sense of the primerHuman:5′-RACE HCR15′–CCTCGGTGCTCAAGTTCATTTGTAACGC–3′Intron 9Reverse HAIFshR5′–CATAAGTGCTTTGCAACCTCTGAATAGGA–3′Intron 9Reverse3′-RACE I9F5′–GCGTTACAAATGAACTTGAGCACCGAGG–3′Intron 9Forward E10F5′–ACCTCAGCAACTGGACCATGG–3′Exon 10ForwardRT-PCR AIFis3F5′–AGAGGAACCGGCTCCCAGCTC–3′Ex1–Ex10Forward E2F5′–GACAAATGGCTAGCTCTGGTGCA–3′Exon 2Forward E10R5′–CCATGGTCCAGTTGCTGAGGT–3′Exon 10Reverse I9F25′–TCATGCCCACTGTCCTGTAAGT–3′Intron 9Forward R45′–CACCAACTGTGGGCAAACTACT–3′Exon 14Reverse L27F5′–AGCTGTCATCGTGAAGAACAT–3′Forward L27R5′–CTTGGCGATCTTCTTCTTGCC–3′ReverseHAIF Probe E2F5′–GACAAATGGCTAGCTCTGGTGCA–3′Exon 2Forward E10R5′–CCATGGTCCAGTTGCTGAGGT–3′Exon 10ReverseHAIFsh Probe I9F35′–ACTGCACCTGGCCAACAGCAATACTT–3′Intron 9Forward HAIFshR5′–CATAAGTGCTTTGCAACCTCTGAATAGGA–3′Intron 9ReverseMouse:RT-PCR mAIFex35′-GGACTGTCCCCAGAAGAGAAA–3′Exon 3Forward E10R5′–CCATGGTCCAGTTGCTGAGGT–3′Exon 10Reverse mI9F5′–CAAGTGCTGACACCTCTGTGTTTG–3′Intron 9Forward R45′–CACCAACTGTGGGCAAACTACT–3′Exon 14Reverse GAPDHF5′–ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC–3′Forward GAPDHR5′–TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA–3′Reversea Primer/Probe, name of the primer or probeb Sequence, nucleotidic sequence of the indicated primerc Position, exon or intron of AIF containing the primerd Sense, sense of the primer Open table in a new tab ARN Extraction and RT-PCR—Total RNA from human tissues was obtained from Stratagene. RNA from aif+/y and aif-/y ES cells was extracted using the RNeasy kit from Qiagen (Courtaboeuf, France). For the reverse transcription, 1 μg of total RNA was mixed with 200 units of Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and 150 ng of random primers (Promega, Charbonnières, France). As a control, reverse transcription was performed without enzyme. AIF isoform 3 (GenBank™ ID AL049704) was amplified using primers: AIF is3F and R4. Human AIF was amplified using primers E2F and E10R. Human AIFsh isoform was amplified using primers I9F2 and R4. The sense and antisense primers for mouse AIF (mAIF) were mAIFex3F and E10R. The sense and antisense primers for mouse AIFsh (mAIFsh) were mI9F and R4. As a control, the cDNAs of the ribosomal protein L27 and GAPDH were amplified using primers L27F and L27R or GAPDHF, GAPDHR, respectively. The conditions used for the PCR reaction were 94 °C, 2 min; 30 cycles for L27 and GAPDH, 35 cycles for AIF and mAIF and 40 cycles for AIFsh and mAIFsh of 94 °C, 20 s; 64 °C, 30 s; 72 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 10 min. All PCR products were separated by electrophoresis through 2% agarose gel. All primers used were defined in Table 1.Northern Blot, Cancer Profiling Array, and Cancer Cell Line Profiling Array—First choice Human Blot I membrane from Ambion was used for Northern blotting. Cancer Profiling Array II and Cancer Cell Line Profiling Array were purchased from Clontech (BD Biosciences). Northern membrane or cancer arrays were hybridized with HAIF- or HAIFsh-specific probes amplified using E2F and E10R or I9F3 and HAIFshR primers, respectively (Table 1). The probe was radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP (ICN, Orsay, France) using the Random Priming Labeling kit (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany), and unincorporated nucleotides were removed using a nucleotide purification kit (Qiagen). After prehybridization in ULTRAhyb Ultrasensitive Hybridization Buffer (Ambion) for 1 h, membranes were hybridized overnight at 42 °C in ULTRAhyb Ultrasensitive Hybridization buffer. Then membranes were washed at 42 °C for Northern blot or 68 °C for Cancer Arrays (2×, 15 min each) in NorthernMax Low Stringency Wash Solution (Ambion), followed by washing in NorthernMax High Stringency Wash Solution (Ambion). Finally, the membrane was exposed to x-ray film in a cassette. For cancer arrays, signal intensities were calculated for individual spots using STORM phosphorimager (Molecular Dynamics, Eugene, OR). The housekeeping gene ubiquitin (provided by the manufacturer) was used for array normalization.Cell Culture, Transient Transfection, RNAi Assays, and Treatments—HeLa cells were cultured in complete culture medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, Invitrogen) and maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells were seeded at a concentration of a 2 × 105 into 6-well plates or 1 × 104 into 96-well plates. Embryonic stem (ES) aif+/y and aif-/y cells were cultured as described (19Joza N. Susin S.A. Daugas E. Stanford W.L. Cho S.K. Li C.Y. Sasaki T. Elia A.J. Cheng H.Y. Ravagnan L. Ferri K.F. Zamzami N. Wakeham A. Hakem R. Yoshida H. Kong Y.Y. Mak T.W. Zuniga-Pflucker J.C. Kroemer G. Penninger J.M. Nature. 2001; 410: 549-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar). Transient transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 in Optimem (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For RNAi assays, HeLa cells were transfected with specific siRNA double-stranded oligonucleotides designed against human AIF (I, 5′-CCGGCTCCCAGGCAACTTG-3′ and II, 5′-CTTGTTCCAGCGATGGCAT-3′), human AIFsh (III, 5′-GAATGTTTCATGGCAACTA-3′ and IV, 5′-GGAGGATGCTTCCTATTCA-3′), or a common siRNA against both human AIF and human AIFsh (V, 5′-GCATGCTTCTACGATATAA-3′). As a control, we used an irrelevant siRNA oligonucleotide (Co., 5′-GCGATAAGTCGTGTCTTAC-3′). 48 h after the indicated transfection AIF or AIFsh mRNA expression was assessed by RT-PCR as described above. Apoptosis was induced by treatment of HeLa cells for 8 or 12 h with STS (1 μm, Sigma). In a separate series of experiments, the pan-caspase inhibitors z-VAD.fmk (50 μm, MP Biomedicals, Irvine, CA) or QVD-OPH (10 μm, MP Biomedicals) were added 30 min before pcDNA3-AIF, pcDNA3-AIFsh, pcDNA3-empty vector transfection or STS apoptosis induction.Vector Construction—Mammalian expression vectors for AIF and AIFsh were carried out by PCR amplification of the corresponding human cDNA fragments and subsequently cloned into CMV promoter-based expression vectors pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), pEGFP-N1 (Statagene), or C-terminal p3xFLAG (Sigma). Final constructs are referred to as pcDNA3-Δ5′UTRAIFsh, pcDNA3–5′UTRAIFsh (pcDNA3-AIFsh), pcDNA3-AIF, pEGFP-AIF, pEGFP-AIFsh, p3xFLAG-AIF, or p3xFLAG-AIFsh. Empty vectors (pcDNA3, pEGFP-N1, or p3xFLAG) were used as controls.Immunofluorescence—For viewing the localization of pEGFP-AIF, pEGFP-AIFsh, and pEGFP-N1, transfected HeLa cells seeded on coverslips were washed with phosphate-buffered saline three times and stained by Mitotracker Red® (20 nm, Molecular Probes, Invitrogen) for 15 min at room temperature. Nuclear morphology was assessed by staining cells/nuclei with 0.5 μg/ml Hoechst 33342. Cells were mounted and red, green, and blue fluorescence were observed in a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U microscope and analyzed using Nikon ACT-1 software.MTT Reduction and Propidium Iodide Cell Viability Assays—MTT is a water-soluble tetrazolium salt that is reduced by metabolically viable cells to a colored, water insoluble formazan salt. MTT (0.5 mg/ml final concentration) was added to the culture medium of cells growing in 96-well dishes (10,000 cells/well). After incubating the dishes at 37 °C for 20 min, the assay was stopped by replacement of the MTT-containing medium with 50 μl of Me2SO. Formazan salts were allowed to dissolve in Me2SO shaking them gently for 10 min at room temperature, and the assays were quantified by means of a Multiskan Ex ELISA plate reader (ThermoLabsystems, Cergy Pontoise, France). Final values were the result of subtracting 630 nm from 590 nm readings. For DNA loss measurements, cells were exposed for 10–15 min at room temperature to propidium iodide (PI, 0.5 μg/ml) and analyzed by flow cytometry in a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). Data analysis was carried out in total cell population (>10,000 cells).Protein Extraction and Immunoblot Analysis—When whole protein extracts were used, ∼2 × 106 HeLa cells per condition were detached, gently pelleted by centrifugation, and washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were lysed in total extraction buffer containing 125 mm Tris-HCl pH 6.8 and 2% SDS prewarmed at 95 °C. Nuclear and cytoplasmic subfractionation extracts were performed with NE-PER™ Extraction reagents (Pierce) following the manufacturer's instructions. In all cases, protein content was quantified by a modified Lowry assay (Bio-Rad DC protein assay). Around 25–100 μg of protein per condition were electrophoresed in 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels that were electrotransferred to immobilon-polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Filters were probed with the indicated primary antibodies and incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated with peroxidase (Sigma). As substrates for immunodetection, we used the ECL Western blotting analysis system (Amersham Biosciences). Antibodies used in this study were anti-AIF C-terminal (Sigma), anti-AIF N-terminal (Clone E-1, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-FLAG, anti-caspase-3 (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), anti-ICAD (Medical and Biological Laboratories, Nagoya, Japan), anti-actin (Sigma), anti-LaminA/C (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-Erk3 (BD Biosciences).DNA Fragmentation Assessment—For field-inversed gel electrophoresis (FIGE), DNA was prepared from agarose plugs (2 × 106 cells) (25Yuste V.J.

Running conditions were: 180 V (forward pulse), 120 V (reverse pulse) and 1.5 s and 3.5 s for the initial and final switch times (forward and reverse pulses, linear ramp) for 20 h. For the detection of oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation, nuclear DNA from lysed cells (treated with protease K and RNase according to standard protocols) was subjected to conventional horizontal agarose gel electrophoresis (1%) followed by ethidium bromide staining (25Yuste V.J. Sanchez-Lopez I. Sole C. Moubarak R.S. Bayascas J.R. Dolcet X. Encinas M. Susin S.A. Comella J.X. J. Biol.

Zamzami N. Castedo M. Hirsch T. Marchetti P. Macho A. Daugas E. Geuskens M. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1331-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar). In standard conditions, nuclei (103 nuclei/μl) were cultured in the presence of AIF, AIFsh, or AIFΔ353–613 for 90 min at 37 °C. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 (0.5 μg/ml, Sigma) and examined by fluorescence microscopy. Nuclei presenting chromatin condensation and/or a translucid aspect were considered apoptotic. Alternatively, nuclei were stained with PI (0.5 μg/ml) followed by cytofluorometric analysis. In one series of experiments, 600 nm recombinant AIF or AIFsh were preincubated 30 min with different amounts of Hsp70 human recombinant protein (Sigma) or bovine serum albumin (Sigma). Furthermore, in one experiment, nuclei were pretreated with z-VAD.fmk (50 μm, 60 min), washed three times (1,000 × g; 10 min), and exposed to AIF and AIFsh recombinant proteins for 90 min at 37 °C.RESULTSIdentification of AIFsh, a Novel AIF Isoform—To identify new isoforms of AIF we first analyzed, by an in silico approach, human AIF (NCBI Gene Data Base accession number NT_011786, gene ID 9131). This study yielded the putative existence of an alternative and uncharacterized third form of AIF (NCBI Nucleotide Data Base, accession number NM_145813) corresponding to a short splice variant lacking exons 2–9 of AIF. This predicted isoform of AIF has a mitochondrial targeting sequence, but lacks a part of the AIF oxidoreductase domain. Using the total cDNA obtained from both HeLa cells and different human tissues as templates, we performed a PCR amplification to find this putative mRNA. However, using two specific oligonucleotides as primers (AIFis3F and R4), we failed in the amplification of this isoform. In fact, a more careful assessment of the nucleotide sequence observed in the junction between exons 1 and 10 of AIF revealed that the same six nucleotides sequence (TCCCAG) is present at the end of exon 1 and intron 9 (nucleotides 279–284 and 28643–28648 of AIF, respectively). Thus, it seems possible that this predicted in silico variant is only derived from a bioinformatic"
https://openalex.org/W2098132374,"Parkinson disease (PD) is a relatively common neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons and by the formation of Lewy bodies (LBs), which are cytoplasmic inclusions containing aggregates of α-synuclein. Although certain post-translational modifications of α-synuclein and its related proteins are implicated in the genesis of LBs, the specific molecular mechanisms that both regulate these processes and initiate subsequent inclusion body formation are not yet well understood. We demonstrate in our current study, however, that the prolyl-isomerase Pin1 localizes to the LBs in PD brain tissue and thereby enhances the formation of α-synuclein immunoreactive inclusions. Immunohistochemical analysis of brain tissue from PD patients revealed that Pin1 localizes to 50–60% of the LBs that show an intense halo pattern resembling that of α-synuclein. By utilizing a cellular model of α-synuclein aggregation, we also demonstrate that, whereas Pin1 overexpression facilitates the formation of α-synuclein inclusions, dominant-negative Pin1 expression significantly suppresses this process. Consistent with these observations, Pin1 overexpression enhances the protein half-life and insolubility of α-synuclein. Finally, we show that Pin1 binds synphilin-1, an α-synuclein partner, via its Ser-211-Pro and Ser-215-Pro motifs, and enhances its interaction with α-synuclein, thus likely facilitating the formation of α-synuclein inclusions. These results indicate that Pin1-mediated prolyl-isomerization plays a pivotal role in a post-translational modification pathway for α-synuclein aggregation and in the resultant Lewy body formations in PD."
https://openalex.org/W2108172458,"The role of sarcolipin (SLN) in cardiac physiology was critically evaluated by generating a transgenic (TG) mouse model in which the SLN to sarco(endoplasmic)reticulum (SR) Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) ratio was increased in the ventricle. Overexpression of SLN decreases SR calcium transport function and results in decreased calcium transient amplitude and rate of relaxation. SLN TG hearts exhibit a significant decrease in rates of contraction and relaxation when assessed by ex vivo work-performing heart preparations. Similar results were also observed with muscle preparations and myocytes from SLN TG ventricles. Interestingly, the inhibitory effect of SLN was partially relieved upon high dose of isoproterenol treatment and stimulation at high frequency. Biochemical analyses show that an increase in SLN level does not affect PLB levels, monomer to pentamer ratio, or its phosphorylation status. No compensatory changes were seen in the expression of other calcium-handling proteins. These studies suggest that the SLN effect on SERCA pump is direct and is not mediated through increased monomerization of PLB or by a change in PLB phosphorylation status. We conclude that SLN is a novel regulator of SERCA pump activity, and its inhibitory effect can be reversed by β-adrenergic agonists.

We have recently demonstrated that SLN is localized in the cardiac SR membrane, and its distribution pattern is similar to SERCA2a and PLB (11.Babu G.J. Zheng Z. Natarajan P. Wheeler D. Janssen P.M. Periasamy M. Cardiovas. Res. 2005; 65: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). SLN mRNA is differentially expressed in small as opposed to larger mammals. In rodents, SLN mRNA is abundant in the atria with very low levels in the ventricle and skeletal muscles (11.Babu G.J. Zheng Z. Natarajan P. Wheeler D. Janssen P.M. Periasamy M. Cardiovas.

In contrast, in larger mammals including humans, SLN mRNA is abundant in fast-twitch skeletal muscle compared with atria and ventricle (13.Odermatt A. Taschner P.E. Scherer S.W. Beatty B. Khanna V.K.

SLN expression is developmentally regulated (11.Babu G.J. Zheng Z. Natarajan P. Wheeler D. Janssen P.M. Periasamy M. Cardiovas.

A recent study also showed that SLN mRNA was up-regulated ∼50-fold in the hypertrophied ventricles of Nkx2–5-null mice (17.Pashmforoush M. Lu J.T. Chen H. Amand T.S. Kondo R. Pradervand S. Evans S.M.

Structural similarities between SLN and PLB indicate that they are homologous proteins and may functionally substitute for each other (9.Asahi M. Nakayama H. Tada M. Otsu K. Trends Cardiovasc.

Recent studies carried out in HEK cells showed that SLN could inhibit the SERCA pump activity (8.Asahi M. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol.

Co-expression of SLN with either SERCA1a or SERCA2a decreases the apparent Ca2+ affinity of the SERCA pump. Furthermore, when SLN and PLB are co-expressed, SLN was shown to inhibit the polymerization of PLB, resulting in more monomers and super-inhibition of the SERCA pump (8.Asahi M. Kurzydlowski K.

Using adenoviral gene transfer into cardiac myocytes, we recently demonstrated that overexpression of SLN resulted in decreased myocyte contractility and calcium handling. However, overexpression of SLN did not alter the PLB pentamer/monomer ratio in cardiac myocytes (21.Luss I. Boknik P. Jones L.R. Kirchhefer U. Knapp J. Linck B. Luss H. Meissner A. Muller F.U. Schmitz W. Vahlensieck U. Neumann J. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 1999; 31: 1299-1314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Based on our adenoviral gene transfer studies in cardiac myocytes (11.Babu G.J. Zheng Z. Natarajan P. Wheeler D. Janssen P.M. Periasamy M. Cardiovas. Res. 2005; 65: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that SLN can directly modulate SERCA pump activity and affect cardiac contractility. To test this hypothesis, we specifically altered the SLN to SERCA ratio in the ventricle by overexpressing SLN using the α-MHC gene promoter. Results presented in this study suggest that SLN directly inhibits the SERCA pump activity, and its inhibitory effect can be reversed upon adrenergic stimulation and increased frequency. All experiments were performed in accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines and approved by the Institutional Laboratory Animal Care and Use Committee at The Ohio State University. Generation of Transgenic Mice—N-terminal FLAG-tagged mouse SLN cDNA (11.Babu G.J. Zheng Z. Natarajan P. Wheeler D. Janssen P.M. Periasamy M. Cardiovas. Res. 2005; 65: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR and ligated into the SalI and HindIII sites downstream of the 5.5-kb mouse α-MHC promoter and upstream of the poly(A) signal sequence from the human growth hormone. The complete recombinant construct was excised from the plasmid backbone by NotI restriction digestion and gel-purified. To generate transgenic founder mice, DNA samples were microinjected into the pronuclei of C57BL/6 murine embryos at the core facility for transgenics, University of Cincinnati. Mice carrying the transgene were identified by PCR analysis using primers specific for α-MHC (5′-GCCCACACCAGAAATGACAGA-3′) and the antisense primer specific for the 3′-end of SLN cDNA (5′-TCAGTATTGGTAGGACCTCA-3′). The copy number of the transgene was identified by Southern blot analysis of DNA samples from TG mice as described earlier (23.Greene A.L. Lalli M.J. Ji Y. Babu G.J. Grupp I. Sussman M. Periasamy M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24722-24727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Determination of SERCA/SLN Ratio by RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from ventricle or atria (pooled from two mice) using the ULTRASPEC-II RNA Isolation System (Biotecx Labs., Houston, TX). RT-PCR analysis was done using 1 μg of total RNA from ventricle or atria as described earlier (22.Reed T.D. Babu G.J. Ji Y. Zilberman A. Ver Heyen M. Wuytack F. Periasamy M. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2000; 32: 453-464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Following oligo(dT)-primed first-strand cDNA synthesis, 1-μl portions of the first-strand cDNA mixture were subjected to PCR using primers specific for mouse SERCA (forward, 5′-CTGTGGAGACCCTTGGTTGT-3′ and reverse, 5′-CAGAGCACAGATGGTGGCTA-3′), mouse SLN (forward, 5′-GCACTAGGTCCTTGGCATGT-3′ and reverse, 5′-ACTCAAGGGACTGGCAGAGA-3′), NF-SLN (FLAG forward, 5′-CTACAAGGACGACGATGACAA and human growth hormone poly(A) reverse, 5′-AGGTTGTCTTCCCAACTTGC) and mouse GAPDH (forward, 5′-CCCATCACCATCTTCC AGGA-3′ and reverse, 5′-TTGTCATACCAGG AAATGAGC-3′). PCR was adjusted to obtain equal amounts of SERCA2a, and the number of cycles was chosen to fall within the exponential phase of amplification. Total SLN mRNA levels were calculated by adding endogenous and NF-SLN mRNA levels. The PCR protocols were as follows: 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 75 °C for 60 s (35 cycles) with a 72 °C extension for 7 min. Western Blot Analysis—Cardiac homogenate was prepared from transgenic and non-transgenic ventricles, and Western blot analysis was carried out as described earlier (11.Babu G.J. Zheng Z. Natarajan P. Wheeler D. Janssen P.M. Periasamy M. Cardiovas. Res. 2005; 65: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 23.Greene A.L. Lalli M.J. Ji Y. Babu G.J. Grupp I. Sussman M. Periasamy M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24722-24727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Briefly, equal amounts of total homogenates from SLN TG and NTG ventricles were separated on: 5% (for RyR, NCX, and PMCA) 8% (for SERCA and CSQ), 10% (for DHPRα2 and triadin), and 14% (for PLB and NF-SLN) SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were immunoprobed with the following primary antibodies: anti-rabbit SERCA2a, anti-rabbit PLB, anti-rabbit CSQ (ABR), anti-mouse DHPRα2, anti-rabbit triadin, anti-mouse PMCA (ABR), anti-mouse NCX (Swant, Switzerland), anti-rabbit S16 or T17 PLB antibody (Cyclacel, Dundee, UK). Protein loading was normalized to Coomassie Blue staining and α-actin levels. Signals were detected by SuperSignal WestDura substrate (Pierce) and quantitated by densitometry. To determine β-adrenergic agonist-mediated PLB phosphorylation, SLN TG hearts were perfused with isoproterenol in an isolated work-performing heart setup as described below. One set of hearts was freeze-clamped after 30 min without isoproterenol, and the other set was treated with isoproterenol (1 μm) for 5 min after 25 min of perfusion. PLB phosphorylation was estimated by Western blotting analyses. Calcium Uptake Assay—Ventricles from TG and NTG mice were used for calcium uptake assays as described earlier (23.Greene A.L. Lalli M.J. Ji Y. Babu G.J. Grupp I. Sussman M. Periasamy M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24722-24727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 24.Ji Y. Periasamy M. Ana. Biochem. 1999; 269: 236-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Briefly, ventricular tissue was homogenized in 8 volumes of protein extraction buffer (in mmol/liter, 50 KPi, 10 NaF, 1 EDTA, 300 sucrose, 0.5 dithiothreitol, and 0.3 phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and calcium uptake was measured by the Millipore filtration technique. Ventricular homogenates (150 μg) from NTG and SLN TG animals were incubated at 37 °C in a 1.5 ml of calcium uptake medium (in mmol/liter, 40 imidazole, pH 7.0, 100 KCl, 5 MgCl2, 5NaN3, 5 potassium oxalate, and 0.5 EGTA) and various concentrations of CaCl2 to yield 0.03–3 μmol/liter free Ca2+ (containing 1 μCi/μmol 45Ca2+). To obtain the maximal stimulation of SR Ca2+ uptake, 1 μm ruthenium red was added immediately prior to the addition of the substrates to begin the calcium uptake. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 5 mm ATP and terminated at 1 min by filtration. The rate of calcium uptake and the Ca2+ concentration required for half-maximal velocity of Ca2+ uptake (EC50) were determined by non-linear curve fitting analysis using GraphPad PRISM 4.0 software. Isolated Work-performing Heart Preparations—Work-performing heart preparations were performed as described previously (23.Greene A.L. Lalli M.J. Ji Y. Babu G.J. Grupp I. Sussman M. Periasamy M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24722-24727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 25.Grupp I.L. Subramaniam A. Hewett T.E. Robbins J. Grupp G. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: H1401-H1410PubMed Google Scholar). Mice were anesthetized via intraperitoneal injection with 100 mg/kg sodium nembutal and 1.5 units of heparin to prevent intracoronary microthrombi. The aorta was cannulated, and retrograde perfusion (Langendorff mode) was carried out at a constant perfusion pressure of 50 mmHg with Krebs-Henseleit buffer containing (in mmol/liter) 118 NaCl, 4.7 KCl, 2.5 CaCl2, 1.2 MgSO4, 0.5 Na-EDTA, 25 NaHCO3, 1.2 KH2PO4, and 11 glucose. All perfusion buffers were equilibrated with 95% O2 plus 5% CO2, yielding a pH of 7.4. A water-filled catheter (P-50) was inserted through mitral valve into the left ventricle. After a short period of stabilization on retrograde perfusion, the pulmonary vein was cannulated, and perfusion of the heart was switched from retrograde to anterograde. A 20-gauge cannula was tied into the left pulmonary vein to accommodate regulation on recording of venous return. Anterograde work-performing perfusion was initiated at a workload of 250 mmHg ml/min, which was achieved using a custom micrometer-controlled venous return of 5 ml/min and an aortic pressure of 50 mmHg. After establishment of the base line, responses to infusion of β-adrenergic receptor agonist, isoproterenol, by a microperfusion pump (Master flex) were measured with varying concentrations for 2 min. The signals were digitized, and the following indices of cardiac performance were measured off-line using Biobench software (National Instruments, Inc): left ventricular systolic pressure, end diastolic pressure, diastolic pressure, the minimum (–dP/dt) and maximum (+dP/dt) derivatives of left ventricular pressure, time to peak systolic pressure (TPP), and time to reach 50% of relaxation (TR1/2). TPP and TR1/2 were normalized with respect to peak left ventricular pressure because they are dependent upon extent of pressure development. Force-frequency relationship was carried out to assess frequency-dependent contractile reserve. For these experiments, hearts were paced with frequencies from 4 to 12 Hz, and +dP/dt and –dP/dt were determined at multiple intervals. Preparation of Muscle Fibers and Experimental Set-up—Small, unbranched trabeculae or the smallest of the RV papillary muscles were dissected from the right ventricle as previously described (26.Stull L.B. Leppo M. Marban E. Janssen P.M.L. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2002; 34: 1367-1376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The dimensions of the preparations were 221 ± 21 μm, 174 ± 18, and 1401 ± 78 (width × thickness × length in μm, n = 15) and are not different between the two groups. Using the dissection microscope, muscles were mounted between a platinum-iridium basket-shaped extension of a force transducer (KG7, Scientific Instruments GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany) and a hook (valve end) connected to a micromanipulator. Muscles were superfused with Krebs-Henseleit buffer ([Ca2+]o 1.5 mmol/liter) at 37 °C and stimulated at baseline (4 Hz). Muscles were stretched to a length where a small increase in length resulted in nearly equal increases in resting tension and active developed tension (26.Stull L.B. Leppo M. Marban E. Janssen P.M.L. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2002; 34: 1367-1376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This length was selected to be comparable to a length close to the end of diastole. After stabilization, contractile parameters were recorded at 4 different muscle lengths between slack and optimal length, stimulated at rates between 4 and 14 Hz in a second protocol, and finally the response to a concentration-response curve of isoproterenol was assessed. SR calcium load was estimated via rapid cooling contracture (RCC) experiments (27.Bers D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: C408-C415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In all the experiments performed, the parameters of developed force (Fdev) and diastolic force (Fdia) were determined and normalized to the cross-sectional area of the muscle. Additionally, the maximum speed of contraction (dF/dtmax) and relaxation (dF/dtmin) were measured. Preparations that did not exceed 10 mN/mm2 sometime during the protocol or muscles that displayed excessive rundown of Fdev (>10%/hour) were excluded. Multiple analyses of variance were used to determine significant differences between the interventions, with post-hoc t test when appropriate. A two-sided p value of < 0.05 was considered significant. n = 6–8 experiments are included in each protocol, and all values are expressed as the mean ± S.E. unless stated otherwise. Simultaneous Measurement of Ca2+ Transient and Myocyte Shortening—Ventricular myocytes from SLN TG and NTG hearts were isolated as described previously (28.Li L. Chu G. Kranias E.G. Bers D.M. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ Physiol. 1998; 274: 1335-1347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, mice were injected intraperitoneally (IP) with 0.04 ml of heparin (10,000 units/ml) 20 min before a 0.2-ml IP injection of sodium pentobarbital until unreactive. After aortic cannulation, heart was mounted on Langendorff apparatus and cleared of all blood with modified MEM (Sigma M0518, 37 °C, bubbled with 95%O2, 5%CO2). The heart was then perfused with blenzyme solution (Roche Applied Science, 37 °C, bubbled with 95%O2, 5%CO2). The tissue was then dissected in a Petri dish with fresh blenzyme solution, removing atria, and chopping into fine pieces. After triturating with a large bore pipette, the remaining pieces were post-digested with additional blenzyme solution and filtered through a 200 micron nylon mesh. All myocyte suspensions were spun for 20 s at 1000 rpm, supernatant decanted, and resuspended in modified MEM to which 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 50 μm Ca2+ were added. After gravity-settled, cells were resuspended in MEM containing 200 μm Ca2+. Myocytes were loaded at 22 °C with Fluo-4 AM (10 μm, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 30 min for intracellular de-esterification. The instrumentation used for cell fluorescence measurement was a Cairn Research Limited (Faversham, UK) epifluorescence system. Myocytes were field-stimulated and superfused with (in mm/liter): 140 NaCl, 4 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 10 glucose, and 5 HEPES (pH 7.4). [Ca2+]i was measured by Fluo-4 epifluorescence with excitation at 480 ± 20 nm and emission at 535 ± 25 nm. The illumination field was restricted to a small spot to get emission from a single cell. Data were expressed as F/Fo, where F is the fluorescence intensity and Fo is the intensity at rest. Simultaneous measurement of shortening was also performed using an edge detection system (Crescent Electronics, Sandy, UT). Data were expressed as % of resting cell length. Myocytes were field-stimulated via platinum electrodes connected to a Grass S48 stimulator, with Ca2+ transients and myocyte shortening simultaneously measured (29.Ziolo M.T. Martin J.L. Bossuyt J. Bers D.M. Pogwizd S.M. Circ. Res. 2005; 96: 815-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Force-frequency relationship (0.2, 0.5, 1, and 2 Hz) and isoproterenol dose-response curves were generated. Statistics—Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was estimated by a paired Student's t test. A value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Generation of SLN TG Mice—To determine how SLN regulates cardiac function and SR calcium transport, we overexpressed FLAG-tagged mouse SLN cDNA under the control of the α-MHC promoter (Fig. 1A). The TG mice were generated in a CB56 background and the progeny screened for germline transmission of the transgene. PCR analysis indicated that 4 of 52 of initial F0 mice carried the transgene. Out of 4 founders, only 2 of them (line 20 and line 26) were fertile and produced progeny. Southern blot analysis revealed mouse lines 20 and 26 carried 1 and 2 copies of the transgene, respectively (data not shown). Transgenic mice were born in the expected Mendelian ratio and were indistinguishable from their NTG control littermates; there were no signs of phenotypic alterations or reduced viability. Western blot analysis of NF-SLN expression in various muscle tissues including cardiac, skeletal, and vascular smooth muscle indicates that NF-SLN expression is restricted to heart and not detectable in other tissues analyzed (Fig. 1B). Further our data suggest that NF-SLN expression is ∼3-fold higher in the ventricle than in the atria of TG mice. This finding may suggest that high levels of endogenous SLN present in the atria may limit the amount of transgenic NF-SLN expression. To quantitate the NF-SLN expression in line 20 and line 26, Western blot analysis was carried out. Results shown in Fig. 1C indicate that line 26 expresses ∼2-fold higher NF-SLN protein than line 20. The transgenic mouse line 26 at 18–25 weeks old was chosen for further studies. To determine whether TG expression of NF-SLN has modified the levels of endogenous SLN, RT-PCR analysis was carried out, because we did not have a suitable antibody for SLN at that time. Our results show that overexpression of NF-SLN did not alter the endogenous SLN mRNA levels in both atria and ventricle (data not shown). We additionally wanted to determine the relative ratio of SLN to SERCA2a in the NTG and TG atria and ventricle. The data shown in Fig. 1D indicate the percent expression level of SLN mRNA to SERCA2a mRNA levels. Our results suggest that the ratio of SLN/SERCA is higher in atria than in the ventricle. In the transgenic ventricle, the ratio of SLN to SERCA was increased 57% more (from 107.35 ± 2.3% to 169.47 ± 2.7%) indicating that we altered the SLN to SERCA2a ratio successfully. Overexpression of SLN Is Not Associated with Any Cardiac Pathology—We next examined whether overexpression of SLN led to any structural abnormalities and caused muscle pathology. There was no difference in the heart weight to body weight ratio in SLN TG mice when compared with age- and sex-matched littermate controls. Histological analysis of hearts from lines 20 and 26 at the age of 3, 6, and 12 months (via conventional microscopic evaluation of hematoxylin/eosin and Masson's trichromestained slices) revealed no difference in tissue morphology or evidence of fibrosis (Data not shown). Expression Levels of SR Calcium-handling Proteins Are Unchanged in Transgenic Mice—Quantitative Western blot analysis was carried out to determine if increased SLN expression affected the levels of SERCA and PLB in the TG ventricle. Our results show that the expression levels of SERCA2a, PLB, and CSQ were unchanged in the TG ventricle (Fig. 2A) indicating that expression of these proteins was not affected by SLN overexpression. We also quantitated the expression levels of ryanodine receptor (RyR), L-type calcium channel subunit-dihydropyridine receptor α2 (DHPRα2), and triadin to determine changes in Ca2+ release and entry mechanisms. As shown in Fig. 2B, SLN overexpression did not affect the RyR, DHPRα2, or triadin levels. To determine whether SLN inhibition of the SERCA pump is associated with compensatory changes in the expression of other plasma membrane calcium extrusion systems, we quantitated the sodium-calcium exchanger (NCX) and plasma membrane calcium ATPase (PMCA) levels. Results in Fig. 2B indicate that SLN overexpression did not alter the expression of NCX and PMCA protein levels. Basal Phosphorylation of PLB Is Not Affected by SLN Overexpression—In a recent study, Asahi et al. (12.Asahi M. Otsu K. Nakayama H. Hikoso S. Takeda T. Gramolini A.O. Trivieri M.G. Oudit G.Y.

Mice with homozygous null Pax2 mutations have developmental defects of the midbrain-hindbrain region, optic nerve, and ear and are anephric. During nephrogenesis, PAX2 is also expressed by mesenchymal cells as they cluster and reorganize to form proximal elements of each nephron, but the function of PAX2 in these cells is unknown. In this study we hypothesized that PAX2 activates expression of WNT4, a secreted glycoprotein known to be critical for successful nephrogenesis. PAX2 protein was identified in distal portions of the “S-shaped” body, and the protein persists in the emerging proximal tubules of murine fetal kidney. PAX2 activated WNT4 promoter activity 5-fold in co-transfection assays with JTC12 cells derived from the proximal tubule. Inspection of the 5′-flanking sequence of the human WNT4 gene identified three novel PAX2 recognition motifs; each exhibited specific PAX2 protein binding in electromobility shift assays. Two motifs were contained within a completely duplicated 0.66-kb cassette. Transfection of JTC12 cells with a PAX2 expression vector was associated with a 7-fold increase in endogenous WNT4 mRNA. In contrast, Wnt4 mRNA was decreased by 60% in mesenchymal cell condensates of fetal kidney from mice with a heterozygous Pax2 mutation. We speculated that a key function of PAX2 is to activate WNT4 gene expression in metanephric mesenchymal cells as they differentiate to form elements of the renal tubules.

Two motifs were contained within a completely duplicated 0.66-kb cassette. Transfection of JTC12 cells with a PAX2 expression vector was associated with a 7-fold increase in endogenous WNT4 mRNA. In contrast, Wnt4 mRNA was decreased by 60% in mesenchymal cell condensates of fetal kidney from mice with a heterozygous Pax2 mutation. We speculated that a key function of PAX2 is to activate WNT4 gene expression in metanephric mesenchymal cells as they differentiate to form elements of the renal tubules. PAX2 belongs to the “paired box” family of transcription factors. Like other family members, it is thought to orchestrate the patterns of gene expression in specific cells during organ development. Homozygous inactivation of the Pax2 gene in mice causes malformation of the midbrain-hindbrain region, the optic nerve, and complete absence of the kidneys (1Dressler G.R. Deutsch U. Chowdhury K. Nornes H.O. Gruss P. Development (Camb.). 1990; 109: 787-795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Torres M. Gomez-Pardo E. Dressler G.R. Gruss P. Development (Camb.). 1995; 121: 4057-4065Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although these observations clearly implicate PAX2 in the development of renal and neural tissue, little is known about its precise gene targets or the specific developmental processes in which it plays a role. Studies thus far suggest that the developmental functions of PAX2 may be multiplex, activating distinct panels of genes in different cell lineages at different stages. During development of mammalian kidney, PAX2 first appears during the caudal descent of the nephric duct where it affects the fate of a cell (3Bouchard M. Souabni A. Mandler M. Neubuser A. Busslinger M. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2958-2970Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). When the nephric duct arrives at about somite 26, a “ureteric bud” (UB) 2The abbreviations used are: UB, ureteric bud; RT, reverse transcriptase; Gapdh, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; DTT, dithiothreitol; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; E, embryonic day; mut, mutant. emerges from its wall and grows toward the adjacent lateral mesenchyme. This event is again orchestrated by PAX2 through activation of glial cell line-derived neurotropic Factor (GDNF) in the uninduced mesenchyme and activation of the GDNF receptor (RET) in UB cells (4Brophy P.D. Ostrom L. Lang K.M. Dressler G.R. Development (Camb.). 2001; 128: 4747-4756Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, homozygous Pax2 knockout mice lack normal ureteric bud outgrowth and are unable to induce metanephric kidneys (2Torres M. Gomez-Pardo E. Dressler G.R. Gruss P. Development (Camb.). 1995; 121: 4057-4065Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A third function of PAX2 in developing kidney involves suppression of programmed cell death in ureteric bud cells. During normal development, the UB arborizes as it penetrates the metanephric mesenchyme, inducing nephrons to form at the tip of each branch. Final nephron endowment is determined by the extent of UB branching achieved at the point when new nephron formation comes to an end in the perinatal period. Mice and humans lacking one Pax2 allele have increased apoptosis of UB cells, reduced UB branching, and suboptimal final nephron number (5Torban E. Eccles M.R. Favor J. Goodyer P.R. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 157: 833-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 6Porteous S. Torban E. Cho N.P. Cunliffe H. Chua L. McNoe L. Ward T. Souza C. Gus P. Giugliani R. Sato T. Yun K. Favor J. Sicotte M. Goodyer P. Eccles M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Delivery of a pro-apoptotic gene (Baxα) to the developing UB reduces arborization (7Dziarmaga A. Clark P. Stayner C. Julien J.P. Torban E. Goodyer P. Eccles M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2003; 14: 2767-2774Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar); conversely, the branching defect seen in Pax2 heterozygous mutants can be rescued by targeted expression of an anti-apoptotic gene (Bcl2) to the UB lineage 3E. Torban, A. Dziarmaga, D. Iglesias, L. L. Chu, T. Vassilieva, M. Little, M. Eccles, M. Discenza, J. Pelletier, and P. Goodyer, unpublished data. or by administration of caspase inhibitors to pregnant mice bearing heterozygous mutant Pax2 fetuses (8Clark P. Dziarmaga A. Eccles M. Goodyer P. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2004; 15: 299-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Once within the mesenchyme, the arborizing UB delivers signals to nearby mesenchymal cells, inducing them to cluster at the tip of each UB branch. These induced mesenchymal cells express moderately high levels of PAX2 as they undergo a profound transformation into polarized epithelia, but the precise role of PAX2 during this process is unknown (2Torres M. Gomez-Pardo E. Dressler G.R. Gruss P. Development (Camb.). 1995; 121: 4057-4065Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rapid cell division and coordinated cell movement result in twisting growth of an elongated “S-shaped” body with a central lumen lined by epithelial cells. Capillary ingrowth at one end allows formation of the glomerulus, and at its other end fusion with the UB branch tip affords outflow of luminal fluid into the common collecting system. Torban et al. (9Torban E. Goodyer P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1401: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) showed that PAX2 expression is associated with an increase in E-cadherin and suppression of vimentin levels in cultured fetal kidney cells, thus proposing that PAX2 might regulate the transition from mesenchyme to epithelium. However, the PAX2 gene targets that might mediate this transition remain elusive. In 1994, Stark et al. (10Stark K. Vainio S. Vassileva G. McMahon A.P. Nature. 1994; 372: 679-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar) reported that formation of S-shaped bodies in the developing kidney is critically dependent on WNT4, a member of the WNT family of secreted glycoproteins. WNT4 is expressed by the induced metanephric mesenchymal cells as they cluster and undergo transformation into epithelia (10Stark K. Vainio S. Vassileva G. McMahon A.P. Nature. 1994; 372: 679-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). Knock-out mice with homozygous inactivation of the Wnt4 gene exhibit initial outgrowth of the ureteric bud, induction of mesenchymal cell clustering, and local expression of PAX2 but no further development of S-shaped bodies (10Stark K. Vainio S. Vassileva G. McMahon A.P. Nature. 1994; 372: 679-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar, 11Kispert A. Vainio S. McMahon A.P. Development (Camb.). 1998; 125: 4225-4234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of S-shaped body formation, UB branching comes to an abrupt halt, and the mutant Wnt4 mice are born anephric (10Stark K. Vainio S. Vassileva G. McMahon A.P. Nature. 1994; 372: 679-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). In general, WNTs are thought to transmit signals to nearby cells bearing cognate receptors, thereby organizing cell alignment and tissue patterns during development (12Huelsken J. Birchmeier W. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 547-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). WNT4 was recently shown to be capable of activating the “canonical” β-catenin signaling pathway and therefore presumably regulates β-catenin-responsive gene targets, such as c-Myc, involved in cellular growth (13Lyons J.P. Mueller U.W. Ji H. Everett C. Fang X. Hsieh J.C. Barth A.M. McCrea P.D. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 298: 369-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In this study, we hypothesize that a key function of PAX2 in the S-shaped body is to activate the WNT4 gene. We show that PAX2 protein is present in the distal portion of the S-shaped body and persists in the emerging proximal tubular cells of fetal kidney. Transient transfection of a PAX2 expression vector into JTC12 cells (derived from the simian proximal tubule) stimulates transcriptional activity of the human WNT4 promoter. We identify several unique recognition motifs in the WNT4 promoter that specifically bind PAX2 protein and show that JTC12 cells stably transfected with PAX2 cDNA have increased endogenous WNT4 expression. Finally, we demonstrate that endogenous WNT4 expression is reduced in hypoplastic fetal kidneys of mice bearing a heterozygous Pax2 mutation. Cell Lines, Transfections, and Luciferase Assays—The monkey proximal tubule cell line (JTC12) was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in a humidified environment. The activity of a 10.7-kb WNT4 promoter was analyzed in transient transfections of the JTC12 cell line in the presence or absence of a PAX2 expression vector. Plasmid DNA preparation, cell culture, and transient transfections using FuGENE™ 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) were carried out as described (14Stayner C.K. Cunliffe H.E. Ward T.A. Eccles M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25472-25479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), with modifications. Briefly, cells at 50-70% confluency were co-transfected with 0.4 μg of pRSV-βgal and 0.8 μg of human WNT4 promoter/pGL2Basic. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, lysed in a passive lysis buffer (Promega), and assayed for firefly luciferase and normalized for β-galactosidase (Galacto-Star, Tropix). Transfections were performed in replicates of six on three separate occasions. Immunohistochemistry—Immunohistochemisty for PAX2 was performed on 4% paraformaldehyde-fixed, paraffin-embedded embryonic mouse kidney tissues as described previously (6Porteous S. Torban E. Cho N.P. Cunliffe H. Chua L. McNoe L. Ward T. Souza C. Gus P. Giugliani R. Sato T. Yun K. Favor J. Sicotte M. Goodyer P. Eccles M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Briefly, 7-μm sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and boiled twice for 5 min in 10 mm citrate buffer, pH 7.0. Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched using 3% H2O2 in methanol for 30 min at room temperature. After a 30-min blocking step with horse serum, sections were incubated with 1:50 dilution of polyclonal rabbit anti-PAX2 antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA) overnight at 4 °C, followed by staining with the Vectastain ABC universal kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) as described by the manufacturer. Sections were then incubated with diaminobutyric acid reagent (Vector Laboratories). Sections were counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin (Sigma) for 3 min, dehydrated, and mounted with Permount (Fisher). Immunofluorescent staining was performed on 14-μm frozen sections of embryonic mouse kidney. Briefly, sections were rinsed in PBS for 10 min and fixed in ice-cold acetone for 10 min. Sections were blocked with horse serum for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with a 1:50 dilution of primary polyclonal rabbit anti-PAX2 antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) overnight at 4 °C. Sections were exposed for 1 h at room temperature to secondary anti-rabbit IgG (1:200) conjugated with Texas Red as per the manufacturer's recommendations (Vector Laboratories). Sections were then stained with a 1:200 dilution of fluorescein-labeled Lotus tetragonolobus lectin (Vector Laboratories) overnight at 4 °C and mounted with aqueous gel mount (Sigma). To confirm the proximal tubule origin of JTC12 cells, monolayers were cultured on chamber slides in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) until they reached 60% confluence. The cells were fixed for 10 min on ice in 4% paraformaldehyde. After several washes in PBS, cells were incubated with fluorescein-labeled L. tetragonolobus lectin (Vector Laboratories) for 30 min at 37 °C. Slides were then rinsed in PBS and mounted with aqueous gel mount (Sigma). In Situ Hybridization—Mouse Wnt4 cDNA (851-1275 bp) subcloned into PGEM7zf vector was kindly provided by Dr. McMahon (Harvard University). The Wnt4 antisense and sense probes (424 bp) were generated by linearizing the vector with BamHI and XbaI restriction endonucleases and Sp6 and T7 promoters, respectively. 0.5 μg (1 μl) of the plasmid template was combined with 125 μCi of 35S-labeled α-UTP (1320 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 1 μl of 10× transcription buffer (100 mm NaCl, 400 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 60 mm MgCl2, 100 mm DTT, 40 mm spermidine), 1.5 μl of 3.3 mm of ATP, GTP, and CTP mixture (Amersham Biosciences), 1 μl of 100 mm DTT, and 0.25 units of RNAguard (Roche Applied Science). 20 units of the appropriate enzyme was added, and the final mixture was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. DNA template was digested with 2.5 units of DNase (Roche Applied Science) at 37 °C for 15 min. The cRNA probes were purified by ethanol precipitation in the presence of carrier yeast RNA and washed two times with 70% EtOH. Integrity of probe was checked on a 4% denaturing gel. 5 × 104 cpm/μl of the hybridization buffer in a volume of 100 μl was used for in situ hybridization on each slide. E14.5 Pax21Neu wild type and heterozygous mouse embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. Five-micron sections were mounted on Frost-Plus glass slides (Fisher), deparaffinized, rehydrated, and incubated with 5 μg/ml of proteinase K followed by three rinses in PBS. Slides were incubated for 2-4 h at room temperature in 100 μl of prehybridization buffer (4× SET, 1× Denhardt's, 0.5 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA, 0,6 mg/ml yeast RNA) mixed with 50% formamide followed by overnight incubation at 52.5 °C in 100 μl of 50% formamide and 1× hybridization buffer (4× SET, 1× Denhardt's solution, 100 μg/ml single-stranded DNA, 100 μg/ml yeast RNA, 10% dextran sulfate) combined with the labeled probe. Slides were washed twice in 2× SSC, 5 mm DTT at room temperature for 10 min and twice in the same buffer at 50 °C followed by two washes in 50% formamide, 1× SSC, 10 mm DTT at 55 °C and then at 62 °C. Slides were rinsed three times for 10 min in 0.5× SSC at room temperature and treated with 20 μg/ml RNase A in 3.5× SSC at 37 °C. They were then rinsed four times in 3.5× SSC and three times at room temperature in 2× SSC, followed by dehydration in ethanol. Slides were dipped in the photographic emulsion, exposed, counterstained with hematoxylin-eosin, and photographed. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSAs)—Probes for EMSAs were prepared from synthetically generated oligonucleotides. The sequences of the probes are as below. Putative sense (A and B) and antisense (C) core recognition nucleotides are double-underlined. Mutations were created in conserved core PAX2 recognition nucleotides for sites A, B, and C; these are shown in boldface. For A, 5′-TCGGCGGCGCGCAGCCAGGCGTGCCTGGAG-3′; for B, 5′-AGAGCCCCCCGTCACTCTTGAAAACATCCT-3′; and for C, 5′-CAGTACGTACTTCCTAGATTTGTTGCAACGATTGAATGA-3′; for A (mut), 5′-TCGGCGGCGCGAAGCCAGGCGTGCCTGGAG-3′; for B (mut), 5′-AGAGCCCCCCGTAACTCTTTAAAACATCCT-3′; and for C (mut), 5′-CAGTACGTACTTCCTAGATTTGTTGAAACGATTTAATGA-3′. Synthetic oligonucleotide probes to the WNT4 promoter region were labeled by back filling with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I using [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The Pax2 proteins were synthesized using a T7-coupled transcription/translation reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). The in vitro translated products were incubated with 32P-labeled probes at room temperature for 15 min in a solution containing 4% Ficoll, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), and 1 μg of poly[(dIdC)(dIdC)]. In some reactions, the protein was also preincubated with the 1 μg of anti-PAX-2/5/8(N-19) antibody (catalog number sc-7747; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 20 min at room temperature and then incubated with the radiolabeled probe for 20 min at room temperature. For competition experiments, reaction mixtures were preincubated for 15 min at room temperature with unlabeled oligonucleotide prior to the addition of radiolabeled probes. Following the binding step, reaction mixtures were electrophoresed on a 6% polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide/bisacrylamide ratio, 29:1) in 0.25× TBE buffer (22.25 mm Tris·HCl, 22.25 mm boric acid, and 1 mm EDTA) at 90 V at room temperature. The gels were dried and exposed to Kodak X-Omat film at room temperature. Stable Transfection of JTC12 Cells and Western Immunoblotting—Subconfluent JTC12 cells were transfected with a PAX2 expression vector, pCDNA3.1/PAX2, or with an empty vector without the PAX2 insert, using the lipophilic transfection agent FuGENE™ 6 (Roche Applied Science). After 48 h, cells were then selected in medium containing 400 μg/ml G418 for 2-3 weeks; surviving colonies were pooled. Protein in whole cell extracts were resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, electroblotted onto Hybond ECL membrane (Amersham Biosciences), and probed with rabbit anti-PAX2 polyclonal antibody (1 μg/ml) (catalog number 71-6000, Zymed Laboratories Inc.), followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:10,000; Bio-Rad). To visualize protein bands, blots were incubated in Western Lightning Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus according to the manufacturer's instructions (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and exposed to Kodak X-Omat film. Band intensity was quantified and normalized for GAPDH. RNA Isolation—Three litters of E15.5 Pax21Neu mice were sacrificed, and total RNA was extracted from each pair of kidneys. Genotypes of the Pax21Neu pups and their wild type littermates were identified as described previously (Clark Electromedical Instruments). Total RNA was isolated from kidney lysates with RNeasy columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's directions. RNA was treated with DNase while bound to the RNeasy column. Real Time RT-PCR—All real time RT-PCRs were carried out using the Mx4000 Multiplex Quantitative PCR System (Stratagene). We used the Qiagen QuantiTect™ SYBR® Green RT-PCR method for quantitative, real time one-step RT-PCR. Following reverse transcription with universal primers, PCR amplifications were performed using the recommended buffer supplied by the manufacturer. Primers included the following: 5′Wnt4(sense), ACCTGGAAGTCATGGACTCG; 3′Wnt4-(antisense), TCAGAGCATCCTGACCACTG. Each 25-μl PCR contained cDNA, forward and reverse primers, and the passive reference dye (ROX) to normalize the SYBR Green/double-stranded DNA complex signal during analysis to correct for well-to-well variations. Triplicate or quadruplicate reactions were performed for each template amount. DNA standard template was replaced with water in all no-template controls. We performed simultaneous real time RT-PCR with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gapdh). All N-methyl-d-aspartic acid values were normalized for Gapdh. PCR cycling conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 15 min according to manufacturer's recommendations, followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 1 min of annealing (annealing temperature adapted for specific primer set used), and 1 min/kb extension at 72 °C. The identities of the PCR products were examined by melting curve analysis on the Mx4000 and by agarose gel electrophoresis. Data analysis was performed using the Mx4000 software. The calculated threshold (CT) was determined for all samples and defined as the amount of the Wnt4 gene in relation to the reference gene Gapdh. All results are displayed as fold induction of target gene mRNA expression as determined by the ΔCT method. Briefly, ΔCT indicates the difference between the number of cycles necessary to detect the PCR products of Wnt4 and the reference gene Gapdh. PAX2 Is Expressed in the Distal S-shaped Body and Persists in Fetal Proximal Tubule—Previous investigators have demonstrated Pax2 mRNA expression in induced mesenchymal cells as they cluster at the tip of each ureteric bud branch (2Torres M. Gomez-Pardo E. Dressler G.R. Gruss P. Development (Camb.). 1995; 121: 4057-4065Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our immunohistochemical studies show that PAX2 protein expression is sustained in tubular cells of the distal loop of S-shaped bodies (Fig. 1A). However, PAX2 protein is conspicuously absent in epithelial cells at the proximal loop of the S-shaped body, which will give rise to podocytes of the primitive glomerulus (Fig. 1A). PAX2 expression is evident in maturing tubules that stain for the differentiated proximal tubule marker, L. tetragonolobus lectin (Fig. 1, B-D). The JTC12 cell line, derived from simian renal proximal tubule, also exhibits immunofluorescent staining for L. tetragonolobus lectin (Fig. 1C) and was used for the in vitro studies of PAX2 and WNT4 below. PAX2 Activates the WNT4 Promoter in Vitro—To determine whether PAX2 activates WNT4 promoter activity in vitro, a 10.7-kb 5′-flanking sequence of the human WNT4 gene (15Sim E.U. Smith A. Szilagi E. Rae F. Ioannou P. Lindsay M.H. Little M.H. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2948-2960Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) was cloned into a luciferase reporter vector and co-transfected with a full-length human PAX2b expression vector into cultured JTC12 cells (Fig. 2). Luciferase activity in cell extracts was assayed after 48 h. In the presence of PAX2b, transcriptional activity of the 10.7-kb WNT4 promoter was increased 5-fold. Description of Putative PAX2-binding Sites in the WNT4 Promoter—To determine whether the WNT4 promoter contains plausible PAX2-binding sites, we screened the 10.7-kb 5′-flanking sequence of the human WNT4 gene (15Sim E.U. Smith A. Szilagi E. Rae F. Ioannou P. Lindsay M.H. Little M.H. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2948-2960Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) with MatInspector software. The recognition motif for PAX2 has been studied by others and appears to vary significantly from gene target to gene target. Nevertheless, a consensus sequence consisting of about 11 core nucleotides spaced over a stretch of 25 bp has been proposed (4Brophy P.D. Ostrom L. Lang K.M. Dressler G.R. Development (Camb.). 2001; 128: 4747-4756Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Of 11 putative sites with partial homology to this consensus sequence, only 5 were subsequently shown to specifically bind PAX2 protein. The first putative PAX2-binding motif (motif A in Fig. 3A) was identified close (-461 to -435 in sense orientation) to the transcriptional start site. It contained only 7 of the 11 core nucleotides of the PAX2 consensus sequence but was selected for study because it also exhibited homology with the “PAX5” recognition sites. A second (motif B1 at -2428 to -2405) and third (motif C1 at -2460 to -2581) putative PAX2 recognition sequence were identified further upstream, positioned fairly closely together and in sense and antisense orientations, respectively. These two motifs contained 9 (motif B1) and 6 (motif C1) nucleotides of the PAX2 consensus sequence, respectively. Most interestingly, motifs C1 and B1 lie within a 0.66-kb cassette of DNA (-5331 to -4672) that was completely duplicated further upstream (-7563 to -6904) (Fig. 3A). Thus, two additional putative PAX2 motifs (B2 and C2) were identified close together lying on opposite DNA strands, but these were duplicates of sites in the downstream cassette. The three unique putative PAX2-binding motifs and surrounding nucleotide sequences are listed in Fig. 3B and compared with PAX2 recognition motifs reported by others (Fig. 3C). EMSA—To determine whether the three putative recognition motifs exhibited specific high affinity PAX2 binding, a series of gel shift experiments was performed with radiolabeled oligonucleotides containing the A-C sequences and in vitro translated PAX2 protein. Incubation of PAX2 protein with each radiolabeled probe resulted in single protein-DNA complexes seen as band shifts in Fig. 4A, lanes 1, 5, and 8. The complex disappeared in the presence of PAX2 antibody (Fig. 4A, lanes 2, 6, and 9) but not nonimmune serum (data not shown). The specificity of Pax2 binding was examined in competition assays with increasing amounts of excess unlabeled wild type oligonucleotides A-C (Fig. 4, B-D) and mutant oligonucleotides A (mut), B (mut), and C (mut) (Fig. 4E). Binding of PAX2 to probes A-C was competed out by increasing amounts of unlabeled wild type oligonucleotides A-C (Fig. 4, B-D). Competition was evident at 25-fold excess (probe A), 50-fold excess (probe B), and 100-fold excess (probe C) unlabeled wild type oligonucleotide. EMSAs were also performed with PAX2 protein and mutated oligonucleotides A (mut), B (mut), and C (mut), as probes. Mutation of a single core nucleotide in the putative recognition motif of probe A significantly reduces complex band intensity (Fig. 4B, lanes 9 versus 2). When core nucleotides of motif B and C were mutated, complex formation was completely abrogated (Fig. 4, C, lanes 8 versus 2, and D, lanes 8 versus 2). Similarly, mutant cold oligonucleotides were unable to inhibit complex formation in the same molar range as the unlabeled wild type oligonucleotide competitors (Fig. 4E). Thus, PAX2 recognizes each of the three sites in sequence-specific fashion. PAX2 Activates Endogenous WNT4 in JTC12 Cells—JTC12 cells are derived from the monkey proximal tubule lineage and express the proximal tubular marker, L. tetragonolobus lectin. The cells express modest levels of endogenous PAX2, identifiable by Western immunoblotting (Fig. 5A). To examine the effect of PAX2 on endogenous WNT4 expression, JTC12 cells were stably transfected with a cytomegalovirus-driven human PAX2 expression vector and selected in neomycin-containing culture medium. Stable transfectants were isolated and re-assessed for PAX2 protein level by Western immunoblotting. As seen in Fig. 5A, the JTC12/PAX2 stable transfectants expressed about five times as much PAX2 protein as the parent cell line. Endogenous WNT4 mRNA levels were measured in control (parent) JTC12 cells and in the stable JTC12/PAX2 transfectants by real time RT-PCR, normalizing samples for Gapdh mRNA amount. As seen in Fig. 5B, WNT4 mRNA levels were about 7-fold higher in the JTC12/PAX2 transfectants compared with control cells. WNT4 Expression Is Reduced in the Pax21Neu Mutant Mouse—In previous studies we demonstrated that fetal kidneys from Pax21Neu heterozygotes have reduced PAX2 protein and moderately severe renal hypoplasia, although the architecture of individual nephrons is relatively normal (6Porteous S. Torban E. Cho N.P. Cunliffe H. Chua L. McNoe L. Ward T. Souza C. Gus P. Giugliani R. Sato T. Yun K. Favor J. Sicotte M. Goodyer P. Eccles M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). To determine whether the in vitro evidence of WNT4 regulation by PAX2 reflects an important molecular pathway for mammalian kidney development in vivo, we assessed endogenous Wnt4 expression in E15 fetal kidney of heterozygous Pax21Neu mutant mice and their wild type littermates. Heterozygous male Pax21Neu C3H mice were crossed with wild type C3H females. E15 embryos were genotyped as described previously (8Clark P. Dziarmaga A. Eccles M. Goodyer P. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2004; 15: 299-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and"
https://openalex.org/W2123915935,"Angiogenesis plays an important role in the development of the ovarian follicle and its subsequent transition into the corpus luteum. Accordingly, follicular fluid is a rich source of mitogenic and angiogenic factors such as basic fibroblast growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor secreted by granulosa cells. In the present study, we show that follicular fluid deprived of basic fibroblast growth factor or vascular endothelial growth factor by means of thermal denaturation or antibody neutralization retains its capacity to stimulate endothelial proliferation and angiogenesis. Mass spectrometric analysis of chromatographic fractions stimulating endothelial growth obtained from follicular fluid revealed that the heat-stable mitogenic activity is identical with the subfraction α of high density lipoproteins purified from follicular fluid (FF-HDL). Further investigations demonstrated that sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), one of the lysophospholipids associated with HDL, accounts for the capacity of this lipoprotein to stimulate endothelial growth and the formation of new vessels. Activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (p42/44ERK1/2), protein kinase C, and protein kinase Akt represent signaling pathways utilized by FF-HDL and S1P to induce endothelial proliferation and angiogenesis. We conclude that FF-HDL represents a novel mitogenic and angiogenic factor present in follicular fluid and that S1P is one of the FF-HDL lipid components accounting for this activity. Angiogenesis plays an important role in the development of the ovarian follicle and its subsequent transition into the corpus luteum. Accordingly, follicular fluid is a rich source of mitogenic and angiogenic factors such as basic fibroblast growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor secreted by granulosa cells. In the present study, we show that follicular fluid deprived of basic fibroblast growth factor or vascular endothelial growth factor by means of thermal denaturation or antibody neutralization retains its capacity to stimulate endothelial proliferation and angiogenesis. Mass spectrometric analysis of chromatographic fractions stimulating endothelial growth obtained from follicular fluid revealed that the heat-stable mitogenic activity is identical with the subfraction α of high density lipoproteins purified from follicular fluid (FF-HDL). Further investigations demonstrated that sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), one of the lysophospholipids associated with HDL, accounts for the capacity of this lipoprotein to stimulate endothelial growth and the formation of new vessels. Activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (p42/44ERK1/2), protein kinase C, and protein kinase Akt represent signaling pathways utilized by FF-HDL and S1P to induce endothelial proliferation and angiogenesis. We conclude that FF-HDL represents a novel mitogenic and angiogenic factor present in follicular fluid and that S1P is one of the FF-HDL lipid components accounting for this activity. Angiogenesis, the formation of blood vessels from endothelial cells, occurs during embryonic and adult life (1Augustin H.G. Baillieres Best Pract. Res. Clin. Obstet. Gynaecol. 2000; 14: 867-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). One of the few organ systems in healthy adults in which angiogenic processes appear is the female reproductive system. In the cytogenic and hormone-secreting ovaries, angiogenesis occurs on a dynamic basis during the reproductive cycle (2Reynolds L.P. Killilea S.D. Redmer D.A. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 886-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). The transition of the follicle into the corpus luteum and subsequent luteolysis is accompanied by growth and subsequent regression of blood vessels (3Abulafia O. Sherer D.M. Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 2000; 182: 240-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Massive proliferation and migration of endothelial cells preceding new vessel formation is especially visible during corpus luteum formation after the ovulating gonadotrophin surge (4Meyer G.T. McGeachie J.K. Anat. Rec. 1988; 222: 18-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). These dynamic processes are driven by growth factors and cytokines and are tempered by inhibitors of angiogenesis present in follicular fluid. Several pro- and antiangiogenic molecules involved in endothelial cell proliferation, the principal process underlying ovarian angiogenesis, have been identified in follicular fluid (5Risau W. Nature. 1997; 386: 671-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (4866) Google Scholar). These include in the first place basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) 3The abbreviations used are: bFGF, basic fibroblast growth factor; apo, apolipoprotein;FF, follicular fluid; FF-HDL, follicular fluid high density lipoprotein; S1P, sphingosine 1-phosphate; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell(s); PKC, protein kinase C; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide. and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (6Phillips H.S.

Reprod. 2003; 69: 2078-2084Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), SPARC (secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine), and thrombospondin (11Bagavandoss P. Sage E.H. Vernon R.B. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1998; 46: 1043-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The exact contribution of each of these factors to the formation of new vessels within ovarian tissues remains unclear. Our previous investigations of angiogenic constituents of human follicular fluid indicated that a considerable portion of its mitogenic activity cannot be attributed to VEGF or bFGF (12von Otte S. Paletta J.R.J. Burghus B. Rickert-Föhring M. Nordhoff V. Kiesel L. Greb R.R. Hum. Reprod. 2003; 18: 125-126Google Scholar). For instance, VEGF and bFGF added to endothelial cells at concentrations equivalent to those present in follicular fluid were revealed to be several times less potent in inducing endothelial proliferation than follicular fluid itself. Even the combined application of VEGF and bFGF to endothelial cells failed to induce mitogenic response comparable with that triggered by follicular fluid. These data clearly indicate that follicular fluid is a source of angiogenic activity distinct from traditional growth factors. Follicular fluid HDL (FF-HDL) has been identified as a sole lipoprotein present in follicular fluid until the ovulation of the oocyte (13Simpson E.R. Rochelle D.B. Carr B.R. MacDonald P.C. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1980; 51: 1469-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Unlike serum HDL, FF-HDL particles are cholesterol-poor but contain significantly higher amounts of phospholipids. Apolipoproteins apoA-I and apoA-IV are major protein constituents of FF-HDL. The physiological role fulfilled by FF-HDL remains obscure. It has been proposed that FF-HDL is involved in sperm capacitation (14Therien I. Bousquet D. Manjunath P. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 65: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) or delivery of cholesterol to granulosa cells for progesterone production (15Azhar S. Tsai L. Medicherla S. Chandrasekher Y. Giudice L. Reaven E. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1998; 83: 983-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Here we report that FF-HDL is a potent and endothelial cell-specific mitogen present in human follicular fluid. We further demonstrate that sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), the lysosphingolipid identified in FF-HDL, accounts for a significant portion of the mitogenic and angiogenic activity associated with this lipoprotein. Reagents—S1P was purchased from Biomol (Hamburg, Germany). ApoA-I and apoA-IV were obtained from Sigma. The inhibitors PD98059, H7, and LY294002 were purchased from Calbiochem (Schwalbach, Germany). Human Follicular Fluid—Human follicular fluid (FF) was obtained from 10 women undergoing ovarian hyperstimulation with recombinant follicle-stimulating hormone (Gonal F®, Serono, Unterschleissheim, Germany) after pituitary desensitization with nafarelin acetate (Synarela®; Amersham Biosciences) for in vitro fertilization or intracytoplasmic sperm injection. Ovulation induction was performed by administration of 10,000 IU human gonadotrophin (hCG; Choragon®, Ferring, Kiel, Germany) when at least three follicles reached a diameter of at least 18 mm. After 36 h, follicular fluids were aspirated transvaginally under ultrasound guidance. For removal of cell debris, follicular fluids were immediately centrifuged after aspiration for 5 min at 1500 rpm. All samples were frozen at –80 °C for further analysis. For experiments, fluid samples of all aspirated follicles were pooled. Isolation of Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVEC)—HUVEC were isolated from human umbilical cord veins as described by Jaffe et al. (16Jaffe E.A. Nachman R.L. Becker C.G. Minick C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1973; 52: 2745-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (6019) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, the venous lumen was washed with phosphate-buffered saline to remove coagulated blood, filled with 0.1% collagenase I (Worthington), and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. The cell suspension was obtained by flushing the lumen with endothelial growth medium (Promocell, Heidelberg, Germany) and centrifuged at 173 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was removed, and the cell pellet was resuspended in endothelial cell medium. Cells were seeded at a density of 24,000 cells/cm2 in cell culture dishes (BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA), cultured at 37 °C in a CO2-enriched atmosphere and in medium containing 2% (w/v) fetal calf serum and gentamicin. Confluent monolayers were passaged twice at a ratio of 1:3 using 0.05% trypsin and 0.02% EDTA. Cells were either frozen at passage 2 or used for experiments in passage 3. Cell identity was confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy using fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled antibodies against CD31 (BD Biosciences). Proliferation Assay—Proliferation was assayed in 96-well plates. Cells were seeded at densities of 1 × 104 cells/well in 0.2 ml of endothelial cell medium in the absence or presence of follicular fluid (up to 80 μl/well). After incubation for 48 h at 37 °C, the proliferation was analyzed with 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) using a commercially available kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Heat Treatment of Follicular Fluid and Immunoneutralization—Heat inactivation was performed by incubation of follicular fluid for 30 min at 90 °C. After cooling, follicular fluid was centrifuged for 60 min at 2500 × g to remove denatured proteins, and the supernatant was retrieved for further processing. For immunoneutralization, anti-human VEGF antibody and anti-bFGF antibody (both from R&D Systems) were added to follicular fluid at an antibody/growth factor molar ratio of 1000:1 and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The concentrations of bFGF and VEGF in native, heat-treated, and immunoneutralized follicular fluid were determined in duplicates by a quantitative sandwich-enzyme immunoassay technique using a Quantikine human VEGF immunoassay and a Quantikine human bFGF immunoassay (both from R&D Systems). The minimum detection limits of the assays were 5 and 3 pg/ml for VEGF and bFGF, respectively. Purification of the Mitogenic Activity—All steps of the purification were carried out at 4–8 °C. Native follicular fluid (100 ml) was heat-treated and centrifuged as described above. The resulting supernatant (50 ml) was concentrated by ultrafiltration in a pressure chamber (Amicon, Beverly, MA), equipped with an YN30 membrane. The concentrate (5 ml) was applied to a DEAE-Sepharose column (2.6 × 22.0 cm; 116-ml bed volume (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 10 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 7.0), with a flow rate of 0.5 bed volume/h. The column was washed with 2.5 bed volumes of buffer, and bound proteins were eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (0–1.0 mol/liter; 600 ml) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions exhibiting high protein content were pooled, desalted, and subjected to further analysis. Protein Separation and Identification—Proteins were separated under denaturing conditions in 11.5% (w/w) polyacrylamide gels by the method of Laemmli (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207522) Google Scholar) and stained with Serva Blue R (Serva, Heidelberg, Germany). Bands were excised, and the proteins were tryptically digested in the gel following a slightly modified general procedure, which was previously published (18Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7832) Google Scholar). Peptides generated by proteolysis were extracted, purified using C18 solid phase extraction (ZipZips; Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA), and subjected to MALDI time-of-flight mass spectrometry using TofSpec-2E (Waters/Micromass, Manchester, UK). Data base searches were performed using Mascot software (Matrix Science Ltd., London, UK) screening the NCBI and SwissProt data bases. Lipoprotein Isolation, Characterization, and Modification—HDL (d = 1.125–1.210 g/ml) was isolated from follicular fluid by a discontinuous ultracentrifugation as described by Havel et al. (19Havel R.J. Eder H.A. Bragdon J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1955; 34: 1345-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (6498) Google Scholar) and dialyzed overnight against phosphate-buffered saline. The composition of lipoprotein in follicular fluid was investigated using one- or two-dimensional nondenaturing gel electrophoresis. A standard electrophoresis in agarose gel (1% w/v) was performed in the first dimension to separate major lipoprotein classes. The gels were stained with Sudan black and densitometered, or agarose strips were placed on a 2–15% polyacrylamide gradient gel with a 2% stacking gel. The electrophoresis was performed in a 25 mmol/liter Tris, 0.2 mol/liter glycine buffer (pH 8.2) for 3 h at 100 V. After electrophoresis, gels were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes for immunoblotting with anti-apoA-I antibodies. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were used for apolipoprotein visualization in a chemiluminescence-based procedure. To reduce S1P content in HDL isolated from follicular fluid, the treatment with alkalic phosphatase as described by Ruwisch et al. (20Ruwisch L. Schafer-Korting M. Kleuser B. Naunyn. Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 2001; 363: 358-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) was used. Briefly, 50 units of alkaline phosphatase were diluted in 0.45 ml of buffer containing 200 mmol/liter Tris-HCl (pH 4.5) and 75 mmol/liter MgCl2 in glycine (2 mol/liter, pH 9.0) and added to 1.5 ml of HDL. After incubation for 30 min at 37 °C, pH was neutralized with HCl. Control samples were treated identically without the addition of phosphatase. The apoA-I-phospholipid complexes were prepared as described previously (21Nofer J.R. Junker R. Pulawski E. Fobker M. Levkau B. von Eckardstein A. Seedorf U. Assmann G. Walter M. Thromb. Haemost. 2001; 85: 730-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Western Blotting—HUVEC were lysed in 0.18 mol/liter Tris-HCl, 0.15 mol/liter NaCl, 10% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 5% (v/v) sodium deoxycholate, 1% (v/v) SDS, 50 mmol/liter, 50 mmol/liter NaF, 1 mmol/liter EGTA, 1 mmol/liter orthovanadate, and the Complete® protease inhibitor mixture. Cell lysates (50 μg/lane) were subjected to SDS-gel polyacrylamide electrophoresis according to Laemmli (15Azhar S. Tsai L. Medicherla S. Chandrasekher Y. Giudice L. Reaven E. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1998; 83: 983-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Thereafter, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, which were blocked overnight in Tris-buffered saline containing 5% fat dry milk prior to incubations with antibodies. Loading controls were performed using an antibody against a ubiquitously expressed protein (α-actin). Determination of Sphingosine 1-Phosphate—S1P levels were determined as described previously (20Ruwisch L. Schafer-Korting M. Kleuser B. Naunyn. Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 2001; 363: 358-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Briefly, HDL was mixed with methanol/HCl (1:1; v/v), and lipids were extracted by the addition of 1 volume of chloroform/NaCl. After alkalization with NaOH, the alkaline aqueous phase was transferred into a siliconized glass tube, and the organic phase was re-extracted with methanol/NaCl/NaOH. The aqueous phases were combined, acidified, and extracted twice with chloroform. The organic phases were evaporated, and the dried lipids were dissolved in methanol/K2HPO4. The resolved lipids were derivatized with o-phthaldialdehyde. The derivatives were analyzed with a Merck-Hitachi LiChrom HPLC system (Merck-Hitachi, Darmstadt, Germany) using an RP 18 Kromasil column (Chromatographie Service GmbH, Langerwehe, Germany). Separation was done with a gradient of methanol/K2HPO4 (0.07 mol/liter). The recovery of S1P was calculated using dihydro-S1P as a standard (20Ruwisch L. Schafer-Korting M. Kleuser B. Naunyn. Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 2001; 363: 358-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 22Nofer J.R. van der Giet M. Tolle M. Wolinska I. von Wnuck Lipinski K. Baba H.A. Tietge U.J. Godecke A.

Angiogenesis Assay on Matrigel—Growth factor-reduced Matrigel matrix was purchased from BD Biosciences. Gels were allowed to polymerize in a 96-well plate for 30 min at 37 °C. HUVEC were seeded at 1 × 104/well and grown in endothelial cell medium supplemented with 1% fetal calf serum and without growth supplement for 18 h in a humidified 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator. Tube formation was observed using a light microscope (Olympus BX51, Hamburg, Germany), and pictures were captured with a computer system and subjected to image processing using Image-Pro 4.5 image analysis software (CyberView Corp., Suwanee, GA). The extent of tube formation on matrix gels was expressed as total length of sprouts per captured area. Each control or test compound was assayed in duplicate, and the assays were performed three times. Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as mean ± S.D. unless indicated otherwise. Results were analyzed using Student’s t test, and statistical significance for all comparisons was assigned at p < 0.05. Mitogenic and Angiogenic Activities of Human Follicular Fluid—First, we examined the ability of native human follicular fluid to stimulate endothelial cell proliferation as determined by MTT assay. As shown in Fig. 1A, follicular fluid induced HUVEC proliferation at different concentrations tested (10–80 μl of follicular fluid/well, protein concentration, ∼47 g/liter). Basal endothelial proliferation was used as control and compared with proliferation after the addition of follicular fluid. Depending on the amount of follicular fluid added, the increases in proliferation varied from 25 to 60%. In order to characterize the temperature stability of mitogenic mediators, follicular fluid was subjected to incubation at different temperatures (from 25 to 100 °C) for 30 min. Denatured proteins were removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was used for determination of growth factor concentration by immunoassay or mitogenic activity by proliferation assay. No detectable amounts of bFGF or VEGF were found in the follicular fluid after heat treatment (not shown). Interestingly, the addition of heat-treated follicular fluid to endothelial cells resulted in a marked increase in endothelial proliferation rate, and the heat stability could be demonstrated for up to 100 °C (Fig. 1B). The mitogenic effect of follicular fluid increased with rising temperature during pretreatment of follicular fluid and reached a maximum at 90 °C. This might reflect a temperature-dependent removal of antiangiogenic proteins by heat denaturation. To further characterize the contribution of bFGF and VEGF to mitogenic activity of follicular fluid, the growth rate of endothelial cells exposed to follicular fluid, in which bFGF and VEGF were neutralized with specific monoclonal antibodies, was determined. To achieve this, follicular fluid was incubated for 1 hour at room temperature with antibodies against bFGF and VEGF at an antibody/growth factor molar ratio of 1000:1. Concentrations of bFGF and VEGF in pooled native follicular fluid were 160 pg/ml and 3.6 ng/ml, respectively, and were reduced below the detection limit after pretreatment with antibodies. However, the mitogenic activity of follicular fluid under these experimental conditions was reduced only by 12 ± 5% (n = 3, not significant) and 29 ± 4% (n = 3, not significant), respectively, as compared with untreated follicular fluid (Fig. 1C), indicating that some unidentified residual angiogenic activity was present in follicular fluid after immunoneutralization. Although endothelial proliferation is critical for the formation of new vessels, it may be argued that proliferative effects alone are not sufficient for supporting effective angiogenesis. Therefore, we next sought to directly examine angiogenic effects of follicular fluid using an assay for new vessel formation. When placed on growth factor-reduced Matrigel in the absence of angiogenic factors or follicular fluid, HUVEC formed very few incomplete and narrow tube-like structures (Fig. 1D, Control). Untreated follicular fluid induced the development of expansive tubes organized by a high number of endothelial cells (Fig. 1D, FF). Similar although less pronounced effects were observed in the presence of heat-treated follicular fluid (ht-FF) and follicular fluid after immunoneutralization of bFGF or VEGF (Fig. 1D, ht-FF, FF + anti-bFGF, FF + anti-VEGF). Total sprouted area amounted to 458.3 ± 24 and 15,230 ± 238 pixels in the absence or presence of native follicular fluid (n = 3, p < 0.01), 7826 ± 84 pixels in the presence of heat-treated follicular fluid (n = 3; p < 0.01), and 13,773 ± 239 and 15,133 ± 832 pixels in the presence of follicular fluid pretreated with antibodies against VEGF and bFGF (n = 3; not significant), respectively. Collectively, these results point to the presence of a heat-stable mitogenic and angiogenic activity distinct from bFGF and VEGF in follicular fluid. Purification and Identification of the Mitogenic Activity of Human Follicular Fluid—Heat-stable mitogenic activity from human follicular fluid was partially purified in a two-step procedure. Heat treatment resulted in an approximately 2-fold increase of the relative mitogenic activity, whereas protein content decreased from 48.3 to 2.0 mg/ml. This indicates that the heat pretreatment is an effective initial step in the purification of mitogenic activity. Ion exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose was applied as a second step. As indicated in Fig. 2A (arrows), three protein-rich fractions with retention times between 65 and 80 min could be eluted from the DEAE-Sepharose column using a linear NaCl gradient (0.1–0.4 mol/liter). All eluted fractions were subsequently pooled, desalted, and tested for their mitogenic activity in the MTT assay. As shown in Fig. 2B, the protein-rich DEAE fraction markedly increased endothelial cell proliferation. The subsequent SDS-PAGE of the mitogenically active fraction obtained by DEAE chromatography revealed five protein bands with molecular masses of approximately 14, 28, 43, 47, and 50 kDa (Fig. 2C). Dominant bands were excised from the gel, trypsinized, and subjected to the MALDI mass spectrometric analysis. The mass spectrograms of protein digests and the sequences of derived tryptic peptides are shown in Fig. 2D. Apolipoproteins A-I (SwissProt P02647) and A-IV (SwissProt P06727) were identified as major constituents of 28- and 43-kDa bands. Although a large part of the sequence was detected, signals for some terminal peptides were missing. Whereas the possibility cannot be entirely excluded that apolipoproteins present in follicular fluid are shorter, it is also possible that they were not detected with mass spectrometry due to suppression effects. In addition to bands corresponding to apoA-I and apoA-IV, several weak bands with lower molecular masses were observed that may represent the products of apolipoprotein cleavage occurring at aspartic acid residues at high temperature. Modifications of several amino acid residues were observed, such as the oxidation of methionine residues 164, 245, and 322 in apoA-IV and 118 and 154 in apoA-I. In addition, a large signal suggests ester formation at glutamic acid residue 96 of apoA-IV. Mitogenic Activity of HDL Isolated from Follicular Fluid—Because apoA-I and apoA-IV are major protein constituents of HDL, we assumed that the observed heat-stable mitogenic activity of human follicular fluid was induced by this lipoprotein fraction. As shown in Fig. 3A, FF-HDL induced proliferation of HUVEC in a dose-dependent manner with effective stimulation at a concentration of ∼0.4 mg/ml, which is close to the physiological level of HDL in follicular fluid (23Jaspard B. Fournier N. Vieitez G. Atger V. Barbaras R. Vieu C. Manent J. Chap H. Perret B. Collet X. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 1605-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Fig. 3B demonstrates that the heat-treated HDL displayed no reduction in the mitogenic activity as compared with the native FF-HDL. Furthermore, more than 90% of HDL estimated as apoA-I concentration could be recovered from heat-treated follicular fluid. We conclude that the mitogenic activity of FF-HDL is heat-stable. To further examine the contribution of HDL to the mitogenic activity exerted by follicular fluid, the effect of HDL depletion on follicular fluid-induced endothelial growth was investigated. The removal of an HDL fraction from follicular fluid by a discontinuous gradient centrifugation reduced its apoA-I content from 23.2 ± 0.05 to 4.8 ± 0.06 mg/dl (n = 4) and the HDL-cholesterol content from 12.2 ± 2.4 to 2.25 ± 1.5 mg/dl. Fig. 3C (inset) demonstrates a marked reduction of the electrophoretic HDL fraction after ultracentrifugation. Follicular fluid was previously demonstrated to contain two HDL subfractions, α and pre-β, characterized by distinct migration patterns in two-dimensional electrophoresis. As shown in Fig. 3D, the reduction of HDL content in the follicular fluid after ultracentrifugation was largely accounted by the depletion of phospholipid and cholesterol-rich α-HDL subfraction. The preferential removal of the α-HDL subfraction is also reflected by a disproportional reduction of HDL-cholesterol concentration in comparison with the apoA-I concentration in follicular fluid after ultracentrifugation. Fig. 3E demonstrates that HDL-depleted follicular fluid exhibited a markedly reduced ability to stimulate endothelial cell proliferation as compared with its native counterpart. HDL is known to be a complex lipoprotein fraction comprising several distinct protein and lipid entities. To discriminate which component of HDL accounts for its mitogenic activity, the endothelial proliferation-inducing effects of proteins or lipid fraction derived from HDL were investigated. As shown in Fig. 4A, purified apolipoproteins A-I and A-IV were not able to substitute the native FF-HDL in its ability to stimulate endothelial cell proliferation. Similarly, neither apoA-I complexed to phosphatidylcholine nor phosphatidylcholine-containing liposomes exerted any mitogenic activity. By contrast, the lipid fraction isolated from HDL exhibited a strong mitogenic effect toward endothelial cells. Both the mitogenic effects of FF-HDL and the lipid fraction isolated from FF-HDL were comparable with effects of HDL obtained from plasma. Recently, several lysophospholipids with potent mitogenic properties such as S1P were identified in the HDL fraction of human plasma. Therefore, we next examined whether follicular fluid and FF-HDL contain detectable amounts of S1P. As shown in Fig. 4B, S1P could be detected in both native follicular fluid and FF-HDL. The concentration of S1P in follicular fluid was estimated at 0.87 ± 0.11 ng/mg protein (n = 3; ∼170 nmol/liter). At this concentration, S1P was found to efficiently stimulate endothelial cell proliferation as determined by an MTT assay (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, the S1P content of the follicular fluid was considerably reduced after the removal of FF-HDL by performing discontinuous gradient centrifugation (Fig. 4D), indicating that this lysosphospholipid is associated with FF-HDL. To examine the contribution of S1P to mitogenic effects exerted by follicular fluid, we performed a digestion with alkaline phosphatase, which is known to degrade S1P (18Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7832) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4E, alkaline phosphatase pretreatment of FF-HDL reduced the initially observed increase in endothelial cell proliferation as compared with the native FF-HDL. Contribution of Various Signal Transduction Pathways to Follicular Fluid-induced Proliferation—One consequence of the predicted role of S1P and FF-HDL in the follicular fluid-induced endothelial proliferation is that"

Activation function 1 (AF1) in the NH2-terminal region is the major transactivation domain (2Simental J.A. Sar M. Lane M.V. French F.S. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 510-518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but is not well conserved across species (3He B. Bai S. Hnat A.T. Kalman R.I. Minges J.T. Patterson C. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30643-30653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Activation function 2 (AF2) in the ligand binding domain is a highly conserved hydrophobic surface that is stabilized by agonist binding and required for SRC/p160 coactivator recruitment. AF2 is formed by helices 3, 3′, 4, and 12 and is flanked by clusters of oppositely charged residues (4He B. Wilson E.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2135-2150Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). AR binding of the biologically active androgens testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is thought to stabilize the AF2 helix 12 to complete the coactivator binding surface (5Darimont B.D.

More than 300 different AR single amino acid mutations or partial gene deletions cause the androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS). Partial loss of AR function results in male infertility and varying degrees of incomplete masculinization. Complete loss of AR function results in an external female genital phenotype in the genetic male (8Gottlieb B. Beitel L.K. Wu J.H. Trifiro M. Hum. Mutat. 2004; 23: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 9Quigley C.A. De Bellis A. Marschke K.B. El-Awady M.K. Wilson E.M. French F.S. Endocr.

Mutations in the AR gene occur in the human population with a frequency of ∼0.002%, with single base changes over-whelmingly positioned in the highly structured ligand binding domain. Mutations in the AF2 region of the ligand binding domain can cause AIS without altering equilibrium androgen binding affinity (10He B. Kemppainen J.A. Voegel J.J. Gronemeyer H. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37219-37225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 11Langley E. Kemppainen J.A. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 92-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). For the steroid receptors as a group, AF2 serves as a critical if not essential binding site for the LXXLL motifs of SRC/p160 coactivators that have histone acetyltransferase activity (12Spencer T.E. Jenster G. Burcin M.M. Allis C.D. Zhou J. Mizzen C.A. McKenna N.J. Onate S.A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Nature. 1997; 389: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar). However, AR is unique because AF2 displays different affinities for multiple LXXLL-related motifs. Like other steroid receptors in the presence of agonist, AR AF2 binds the LXXLL motifs of SRC/p160 coactivators but with an affinity 5-10 times weaker than that of the AR NH2-terminal FXXLF motif sequence 23FQNLF27 (10He B.

AR FXXLF motif binding to AF2 mediates the androgen-dependent NH2- and carboxyl-terminal (N/C) interaction that has been shown to be important for androgen-regulated gene expression (11Langley E.

Chem. 1995; 270: 29983-29990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). AR has in addition an NH2-terminal WXXLF-binding motif (433WHTLF437) that contributes to the N/C interaction by binding AF2 (14He B. Kemppainen J.A. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22986-22994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 16He B. Lee L.W. Minges J.T. Wilson E.M. J. Biol.

AR transactivation through AF2 in the presence of agonist appears to be limited not only by the lower binding affinity for the coactivator LXXLL motifs but also through competitive inhibition of coactivator binding by the AR FXXLF motif. Beneath the exterior surface of the AR AF2 coactivator-binding site is a shallow interface juxtaposed against the ligand binding pocket. This close structural arrangement provides a platform for potential communication between AF2 and bound ligand in regulating AR transcriptional activity. Support for structural communication at this boundary region is evident from the slower androgen dissociation that results from FXXLF motif binding to AF2 (11Langley E. Kemppainen J.A. Wilson E.M. J.

Coactivator LXXLL motif binding may similarly induce conformational changes in AF2 and impact ligand binding kinetics (13He B. Gampe R.T. Kole A.J. Hnat A.T. Stanley T.B. An G. Stewart E.L.

Here we investigated structural features and functional consequences of the naturally occurring AR germ line and somatic mutations in or near the AF2 site in search of evidence for a structural relay between AF2 and the ligand binding pocket. In the AR-linked disorders of androgen insensitivity and prostate cancer, AR gene mutations have opposite effects on AR activity that involve the N/C interaction, androgen dissociation rates, and coactivator recruitment.

The structures were viewed with QUANTA (Accelrys, Inc.) and rendered and annotated with PyMol version 0.98 (Delano Scientific, www.pymol.org) and Adobe Photoshop. Cell Transfections—Transcriptional activities of wild-type and mutant full-length human AR (pCMVhAR) were determined in transient cotransfection assays. Monkey kidney CV1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% bovine calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, penicillin, and streptomycin. CV1 cells (4.2 × 105/6 cm dish) were plated in the same medium except containing 5% bovine calf serum, and the next day the cells were transfected with 0.1 μg of wild-type or mutant pCMVhAR and 5 μg of the PSA-Enh-Luc reporter (Michael Carey, University of California Los Angeles) (4He B. Wilson E.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2135-2150Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). For the effects of SRC/p160 coactivators, pSG5-TRAM1 (2 μg DNA/6 cm dish) was included. After incubating with the calcium phosphate-DNA precipitate for 4 h at 37 °C, cells were shocked with 15% glycerol-containing medium, washed, and transferred to serum-free medium lacking phenol red in the absence and presence of the indicated steroids. Cells were incubated overnight and the next day placed in serum-free medium with and without the indicated hormones. The medium was exchanged and incubated for an additional 24 h at 37 °C with or without hormone. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer containing 25 mm Tris phosphate, pH 7.8, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100. After 30 min rocking at room temperature, 100-μl aliquots were analyzed for luciferase activity using an automated LumiStar Galaxy (BMG Labtech) multiwell plate reader luminometer. Two-hybrid interaction assays were performed using human epithelioid cervical carcinoma HeLa cells. HeLa cells were maintained in Eagle's minimum essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 2 mm l-glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin. HeLa cells were plated in 12-well plates (5 × 104 cells/well) and transfected using Effectene (Qiagen) or FuGENE (Roche Applied Science) with 50 ng/well GAL-AR-(624-919), 50 ng/well VP-AR-(1-660), and 0.1 μg of 5XGAL4Luc3 reporter vector. For the Effectene procedure, the DNA transfection mixture contained 50 μl of transfection buffer (Qiagen), 1 μl of Enhancer, and 1 μl of Effectene per well (4He B. Wilson E.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2135-2150Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To each DNA mixture was added 0.4 ml of serum-containing medium, and 0.4 ml was added to each well containing 0.8 ml of fresh serum-containing medium. For the FuGENE transfection, 43 μl of serum-free medium and 0.6 μl of FuGENE were combined per well, and after a 15-min incubation with the DNA, 40 μl of the mixture was added per well. After 24 h, cells were washed, and serum-free medium (2 ml) lacking phenol red was added with and without the indicated steroids. Cells were incubated overnight, and 100 μl of the cell lysate was assayed for luciferase activity after harvesting in 0.25 ml of lysis buffer as described above. Transcription assays of AR activity were performed in HeLa cells as described above using per well of 12-well plates the following: 10 ng of wild-type or mutant pCMVhAR, 0.25 μg of PSA-Enh-Luc, in the absence and presence of 50 ng/well pSG5-TIF2. In Vitro Binding Assays—Competitive binding and ligand dissociation studies were performed at 37 °C in whole cell binding assays by plating 4 × 105 COS cells/well of 6-well plates and transfecting 1 μg of wild-type or mutant pCMVhAR or pCMVhAR-(507-919) per well using DEAE-dextran (4He B. Wilson E.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2135-2150Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated for 2 h at 37°C in 0.6 ml of serum-free medium lacking phenol red and containing 5 nm [3H]R1881 (17α-methyl-[3H]methyltrienolone; 82 Ci/mmol), [1,2,4,5,6,7-3H]dihydrotestosterone (DHT, 124 Ci/mmol), or [1,2,6,7-3H]testosterone (78.5 Ci/mmol) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Nonspecific binding was determined by the addition of a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled androgen. For competitive binding studies, increasing concentrations of unlabeled ligands were added during the 2-h incubation. For ligand dissociation studies, unlabeled androgen was added to the labeling media in 0.1 ml of medium to a final concentration of 50 μm, and ligand dissociation at 37 °C was terminated at increasing time intervals up to 2.5 h. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and total bound radioactivity was determined by lysing cells in 0.5 ml of 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 20 mm Tris, pH 6.8. Dissociation half-times were determined as the mean ± S.E. of the time required to reduce specific androgen binding activity by 50%. Equilibrium binding constants were determined by transfecting 2 × 105 COS cells/well of 12-well plates with 0.05 μg of wild-type and mutant pCMVhAR expression vector DNA using DEAE-dextran. Cells were incubated with 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.5, and 3 nm [3H]R1881 in the absence and presence of a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled R1881 to assess nonspecific binding. Free [3H]R1881 was determined after the 2-h incubation by counting an aliquot of the medium. Cells were washed and harvested, and radioactivity was determined. In the in vitro affinity matrix binding assays, GST fusion proteins were expressed, isolated, and incubated with [35S]methionine-labeled AR ligand binding domain residues 624-919 as described (10He B.

Degradation Assays—Wild-type and V715M, H874Y, or T877A pCMVhAR (10 μg/10-cm dish) was expressed in COS cells (2 × 106/10-cm dish) plated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% bovine calf serum (Hyclone) and transfected using DEAE-dextran. After 24 h, transfected cells were placed in serum-free medium. 48 h from transfection, cells were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C in serum-free medium lacking phenol red and methionine. To the NEG-772 Easytag Express protein labeling mixture, l-[35S]methionine (1175 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added at 80 μCi/dish, and cells were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. The medium was changed to serum-free without phenol red and containing 2 mm cold methionine and 1 nm testosterone, and cells were incubated for the indicated times. At each time point the medium was replaced on all plates. At the indicated times, cells were washed and harvested in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in freshly prepared RIPA buffer (1 ml/dish) containing 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, proteinase inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma). Cell extracts were incubated with 25 μg of AR52 IgG antibody and 10 μl of protein A-agarose beads (Sigma) for 2 h at 4 °C. Affinity beads were centrifuged and washed with RIPA buffer, and protein was eluted in 50 μl of sample buffer containing 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.2% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, and separated on 10% acrylamide gels containing SDS. The gel proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and exposed to x-ray film. Degradation half-times were determined from semi-logarithmic plots of optical density of the scanned AR bands versus time and are expressed as the mean half-time and standard error to reduce AR levels by 50% from three independent experiments. Rapid Dissociation of Bound Androgen Correlates with Reduced AR Activity in Vivo—The relationship between androgen dissociation rate and AR functional activity was investigated by characterizing naturally occurring ligand binding domain germ line mutations in AF2 and flanking regions that cause partial or complete AIS. AR mutations L712F, F725L, Q733H, I737T, G743V, V889M, and I898T result from single base changes in the coding sequence. Equilibrium binding affinities (Kd) for [3H]R1881 (a synthetic androgen) were similar to that of wild-type AR (Table 1). Representative Scatchard plot analysis of the AR AIS mutants is shown in Fig. 1, A and B. On an AIS grading scale of 1-7 (9Quigley C.A. De Bellis A. Marschke K.B. El-Awady M.K. Wilson E.M.

More rapid androgen dissociation was observed for AR with mutations F725L and I737T (t1/2 = 81-86 min), G743V, Q733H, and L712F (t1/2 = 26-58 min), and I898T and V889M (t1/2 = 9-21 min) (Fig. 2A). Mean half-times of [3H]R1881 dissociation (Table 1) suggest that faster androgen dissociation correlates with a more severe AIS phenotype. By comparison, AF2 charge clamp mutation K720A did not alter androgen dissociation, whereas E897K caused more rapid androgen dissociation. Neither charge clamp mutation has been reported in AIS. Androgen dissociation rates were also measured for AR-(507-919), an AR DNA and ligand binding domain fragment that lacks the NH2-terminal region. Androgen dissociation from AR-(507-919) (t1/2 = 33 min) is ∼3 times faster than from full-length AR (Table 1), reflecting the absence of the N/C interaction (14He B. Kemppainen J.A. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22986-22994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Apparent equilibrium binding affinity of AR-(507-919) for [3H]R1881 is nevertheless similar to that of wild-type full-length AR (20Zhou Z.X. Lane M.V. Kemppainen J.A. French F.S. Wilson E.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 208-218Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Naturally occurring mutations can therefore alter androgen dissociation kinetics through different mechanisms. Mutations in AF2 can directly interfere with FXXLF motif binding in the N/C interaction, alter a ligand entry and exit gateway, or have indirect effects through structural changes in AF2 and the ligand binding pocket. Studies using AR-(507-919) allowed us to distinguish these possibilities. Androgen dissociation from AR-(507-919) containing F725L, I737T, or Q733H (t1/2 = 30-38 min) was similar to that of wild-type AR-(507-919) (Fig. 2B and Table 1), indicating this subgroup of AR mutations in AIS does not directly alter ligand entry or exit from the binding pocket. AR-(507-919) containing G743V or L712F increased androgen dissociation (t1/2 = 19-20 min), and I898T and V889M caused the most rapid rates of androgen dissociation (t1/2 = 4-6 min) (Fig. 2B and Table 1) (10He B. Kemppainen J.A. Voegel J.J. Gronemeyer H. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37219-37225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The results suggest that F725L, I737T, and Q733H located in helices 3-5 alter ligand dissociation indirectly in the ligand binding pocket through changes at the AF2 surface that interfere with the N/C interaction. This subgroup of mutations cause partial AIS with phenotypic variation (Table 1). The rapid androgen dissociation rate of AR-(507-919) I898T suggests AF2 residue Ile-898 also impacts the ligand binding pocket from the AF2 surface. The fast androgen dissociation caused by V889M in the 11/12 loop at the base of helix 12 outside the ligand binding pocket suggests Val-889 is involved as gatekeeper for ligand entry and exit. Both I898T and V889M caused grade 6 complete AIS. AR AF2 Mutations That Cause AIS Interfere with AR FXXLF and Coactivator LXXLL Motif Binding—A mammalian two-hybrid assay revealed that these AR AIS AF2 mutations inhibited FXXLF and LXXLL binding to a similar extent. GAL-AR-(624-919) containing the AR ligand binding domain was coexpressed with VP-AR-(1-660) containing AR NH2-terminal FXXLF motif sequence 23FQNLF27 (Fig. 3A) or VP-TIF2-(624-1287) containing the three LXXLL motif regions of TIF2 (Fig. 3B). Relative to the wild-type AR ligand binding domain interaction, only 5-30% luciferase activity remained for the AIS mutants in the presence of 0.1 and 1 nm DHT. Similarly, charge clamp mutation E897K disrupted both FXXLF and LXXLL motif binding, whereas K720A selectively inhibited LXXLL motif binding. Structure Analysis and Predictions for AR Mutations in AIS—Cocrystal structures of the R1881-AR ligand binding domain complex bound to the FXXLF or LXXLL motif peptide demonstrated similar yet distinctive properties (13He B. Gampe R.T. Kole A.J. Hnat A.T. Stanley T.B. An G. Stewart E.L. Kalman R.I. Minges J.T. Wilson E.M. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 425-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The sites of 5 of the 7 residues mutated in AIS lie in close proximity to the bound FXXLF peptide (magenta in Fig. 4 and 5) or LXXLL peptide (not shown). Interatomic distances between wild-type residues mutated in AIS (cyan in Figs. 4 and 5) and the bound FXXLF or LXXLL peptide motifs are summarized in Table 2.FIGURE 5Close up views of wild-type AR AF2 and ligand binding pocket bound with R1881 and AR-("
https://openalex.org/W2036577601,"Ankyrins contain significant amino acid identity and are co-expressed in many cell types yet maintain unique functions in vivo. Recent studies have identified the highly divergent C-terminal domain in ankyrin-B as the key domain for driving ankyrin-B-specific functions in cardiomyocytes. Here we identify an intramolecular interaction between the C-terminal domain and the membrane-binding domain of ankyrin-B using pure proteins in solution and the yeast two-hybrid assay. Through extensive deletion and alanine-scanning mutagenesis we have mapped key residues for interaction in both domains. Amino acids 1597EED1599 located in the ankyrin-B C-terminal domain and amino acids Arg37/Arg40 located in ANK repeat 1 are necessary for inter-domain interactions in yeast two-hybrid assays. Furthermore, conversion of amino acids EED1597 to AAA1597 leads to a loss of function in the localization of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors in ankyrin-B mutant cardiomyocytes. Physical properties of the ankyrin-B C-terminal domain determined by circular dichroism spectroscopy and hydrodynamic parameters reveal it is unstructured and highly extended in solution. Similar structural studies performed on full-length 220-kDa ankyrin-B harboring alanine substitutions, 1597AAA1599, reveal a more extended conformation compared with wild-type ankyrin-B. Taken together these results suggest a model of an extended and unstructured C-terminal domain folding back to bind and potentially regulate the membrane-binding domain of ankyrin-B.

Taken together these results suggest a model of an extended and unstructured C-terminal domain folding back to bind and potentially regulate the membrane-binding domain of ankyrin-B. Ankyrins are a family of membrane adaptor proteins required for the localization of diverse ion channels, transporters, calcium-release channels, and cell adhesion molecules to specialized membrane domains (1Bennett V. Baines A.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1353-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). The ankyrin family is comprised of three genes, ANK1, ANK2, and ANK3, that encode ankyrin-R, ankyrin-B, and ankyrin-G polypeptides, respectively. Human ankyrin-R mutations are a major cause of hereditary spherocytosis, a defect in proteins that connect the membrane skeleton to the lipid bilayer (2Eber S. Lux S.E. Semin. Hematol. 2004; 41: 118-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Ankyrin-B polypeptides are required for the localization of InsP3 2The abbreviations used are: InsP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; aa, amino acid(s); PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GST, gltathione S-transferase; MBD, membrane-binding domain; GFP, green fluorescent protein. receptor, Na/Ca exchanger, and Na/K-ATPase to transverse-tubule/sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes in heart (3Mohler P.J.

Nature. 2003; 421: 634-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar). In addition, loss-of-function mutations in ankyrin-B cause a stress-induced cardiac arrhythmia syndrome in humans (3Mohler P.J. Schott J.J. Gramolini A.O. Dilly K.W. Guatimosim S. duBell W.H. Song L.S. Haurogne K. Kyndt F. Ali M.E. Rogers T.B. Lederer W.J. Escande D. Le Marec H. Bennett V.

Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9137-9142Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Finally, ankyrin-G is required for the assembly of βIV-spectrin, neurofascin, and voltage-gated sodium channels at excitable membranes in the nervous system (5Jenkins S.M. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) and for targeting voltage-gated sodium channels in heart (6Mohler P.J. Rivolta I. Napolitano C. LeMaillet G. Lambert S. Priori S.G. Bennett V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17533-17538Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). An important unresolved question in understanding ankyrin function is the molecular basis for ankyrin specificity in vivo. Ankyrin-B and ankyrin-G are closely related in amino acid sequence (67% amino acid identity between their membrane-binding, spectrin-binding, and death domains) and are commonly co-expressed in many cell types. Nevertheless, ankyrin-B and ankyrin-G interact with different membrane proteins and perform distinct functions in vivo. For example, ankyrins-B and -G are both expressed in cardiomyocytes. However, ankyrin-B is required for the localization of the InsP3 receptor, Na/K-ATPase, and Na/Ca exchanger at specialized sites on T-tubules, whereas ankyrin-G activity is required for targeting of the cardiac voltage-gated sodium channel (Nav1.5) (6Mohler P.J. Rivolta I. Napolitano C. LeMaillet G. Lambert S. Priori S.G. Bennett V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17533-17538Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Furthermore, only transfection of ankyrin-B into ankyrin-B null neonatal cardiomyocytes can rescue the localization of the InsP3 receptor, whereas ankyrin-G is inactive (7Mohler P.J. Gramolini A.O. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10599-10607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Studies with ankyrin-B/G chimeras support a key role for the highly divergent ankyrin C-terminal regulatory domain in defining specific functions of ankyrin-B and ankyrin-G in cardiomyocytes (7Mohler P.J. Gramolini A.O. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10599-10607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain could regulate ankyrin specificity via interactions with other proteins, or through inter-domain interactions. To date Hsp40 and obscurin have been shown to bind the ankyrin-B C-terminal domain (8Kontrogianni-Konstantopoulos A. Jones E.M. Van Rossum D.B. Bloch R.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1138-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 9Mohler P.J. Hoffman J.A. Davis J.Q. Abdi K.M. Kim C.R. Jones S.K. Davis L.H. Roberts K.F. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25798-25804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Evidence for inter-domain interactions of the regulatory domain has come from studies of ankyrin-R. Ankyrin-R 2.2, an alternatively spliced variant missing 162 residues in the regulatory domain, binds to erythrocyte-spectrin and the anion exchanger with higher affinity than the original ankyrin-R 2.1 (10Hall T.G. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10537-10545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The peptide corresponding to the missing residues bound directly to ankyrin-R 2.2 and inhibited binding of ankyrin-R 2.2 to spectrin and the anion exchanger (11Davis L.H. Davis J.Q. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18966-18972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here we provide evidence for a functionally important interaction between the C-terminal and membrane-binding domains of ankyrin-B. We identify sites of interaction between these domains and have generated mutations in 220-kDa ankyrin-B leading to loss of this inter-domain interaction as well as activity in cardiomyocytes. Structural analysis of the C-terminal domain reveals an extended conformation capable of contacting the membrane-binding region of ankyrin-B. Together these results provide evidence for a role of intramolecular interactions in driving ankyrin-B specific function, and offer a potential mechanism for regulation of ankyrin-B activity. Hydrodynamic Measurements—The Stokes radii and sedimentation coefficients of full-length ankyrins and the C-terminal domain were determined as described previously (12Davis J. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 7757-7766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence—Neonatal cardiomyocytes were prepared, transfected, and analyzed as described previously (7Mohler P.J. Gramolini A.O. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10599-10607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 9Mohler P.J. Hoffman J.A. Davis J.Q. Abdi K.M. Kim C.R. Jones S.K.

Images were collected using a Zeiss 510 Meta confocal microscope (40 power, oil objective, 1.4-numerical aperture (Zeiss)) using imaging software from Zeiss. Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—The Gal4 yeast two-hybrid system was used to test direct binding between domains of 220-kDa ankyrin-B. Fragments were PCR-amplified and inserted either in the pACT2 (GAL-4 activation domain vector) or pAS2-1 (GAL-4 DNA-binding domain vector). All constructs were completely sequenced and were free of mutations. Fusion protein expression in yeast was confirmed by immunoblot analysis using either commercially available antibodies to GAL-4 fusions (Clontech) or affinity-purified antibodies to ankyrin-B. Plasmids were co-transformed into AH109 yeast (Clontech) and assayed using Leu, Trp, Ade 2The abbreviations used are: InsP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; aa, amino acid(s); PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GST, gltathione S-transferase; MBD, membrane-binding domain; GFP, green fluorescent protein., and His 3K. M. Abdi, P. J. Mohler, J. Q. Davis, and Vann Bennett, unpublished data. selection. Transformants that exhibited growth on -Ade/His/Leu/Trp media were considered positive for interaction. Ankyrin-B Constructs and Mutagenesis—cDNAs for the membrane-binding domain (aa 1-959), spectrin-binding domain (aa 862-1444), death domain (aa 1445-1555), and C-terminal domain (aa 1556-1840) were PCR-amplified, cloned into the pACT2 vector, and sequenced to confirm that no additional mutations were introduced by the PCR protocol. The death/C-terminal domain (aa 1445-1840) and C-terminal domain (aa 1556-1840) were also cloned into the pAS2-1 vector. Deletions of the C-terminal domain were generated using site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange XL from Stratagene) converting amino acids Ser1820, Tyr1790, Thr1764, Val1732, Ile1672, and Gln1630 to stop codons. The construct D7 was generated by PCR amplification and cloned into the pAS2-1 vector. MBDR1-24 (aa 31-959), MBDR2-24 (aa 64-959), MBDR3-24 (aa 97-959), MBDR4-24 (aa 130-959), MBDR5-24 (aa 163-959), MBDR6-24 (aa 197-959), MBDR7-24 (aa 227-959), MBDR13-24 (aa 443-959), and MBDR19-24 (aa 628-959) were generated by PCR amplification and cloned into pACT2. Site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) was used to mutate amino acids Arg37, Arg40, Asp1557, Glu1560, EE1567/1568, Lys1575, KEE1577/1578/1579, KE1585/1586, Glu1587, Asp1590, and EED1597/1598/1599 to alanines. For protein expression in bacteria, the regulatory domain and membrane-binding domain were cloned into the pGex6p-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences). Inserts were PCR-amplified and inserted into pGex6p-1 using EcoR1/XhoI cloning sites. Plasmids encoding eGFP-220-kDa ankyrin-B EED1597AAA and RAAR37AAAA were generated by site-directed mutagenesis and subcloned into the parental backbone once the mutated sequence was confirmed. cDNA of 220-kDa ankyrin-B was subcloned into pBacPak9 using EcoR1/Pme1 sites to generate pBacPaK9-6His ankyrin-B WT. Sub-cloning the mutated fragment from peGFP-ankyrin-B RAAR37AAAA using EcoR1/NdeI sites generated the mutant, pBacPak9-6His ankyrin-B RAAR37 AAAA. Sub-cloning the mutated region from peGFP-ankyrin-B EED1597 AAA using KpnI/SacII sites generated pBakPak9-6His ankyrin-B EED1597AAA. Recombinant Protein Expression and Purification—BL21(DE3)-pLysS cells transformed with pGex6p-1 regulatory domain, pGex6p-1 death domain, pGex6p-1 membrane-binding domain, or pGex6p-1 C-terminal domain were grown overnight at 37 °C in LB/amp/chloramphenicol media and sub-cultured the following day for large-scale expression. Cells were grown to an optical density of 0.6-0.8 and induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation for 10 min at 8,000 × g, resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4), and frozen at -80 °C following resuspension. Lysis was completed after thawing through activity of lysozyme. The crude extract was syringed through a 22-gauge needle to shear bacterial DNA in lysis buffer (PBS, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 40 μg/ml 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonylfluoride hydrochloride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 40 μg/ml benzamidine, 10 μg/ml pepstatin). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 110,000 × g (35,000 rpm) for 1 h. Supernatants were added to 2 ml of equilibrated glutathione-agarose (Amersham Biosciences) batchwise for 4 h at 4°C. The agarose was washed with 1× PBS containing 0.65 m NaCl and eluted using elution buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, 10 mm glutathione, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 8.0). Further purification was performed using high-pressure liquid chromatography on either a Mono Q or Mono S 5/5 HR column. Protein concentrations were determined using Bradford assay. When needed, GST was cleaved using 30 units of Precision Protease (Amersham Biosciences) per milligram of fusion protein and incubated for 6 h at 4 °C. Digests were dialyzed in PBS buffer overnight and re-coupled to glutathione resin for 2 h at 4°C. All purification steps were analyzed on a Fairbanks SDS-PAGE gradient gel stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Expression and Purification of Full-length Ankyrin-B—The baculovirus protein expression system was used to express and purify full-length ankyrin-B and mutants. pBacPak9 (Clontech) plasmids encoding ankyrin-B WT, 37AAAA, and 1597AAA were co-transfected into sf21 insect cells along with viral plasmid pBakPak6(Clontech) to generate recombinant virus. Single viral clones were isolated for each ankyrin and amplified for expression. Cells were lysed in 50 mm phosphate buffer, 0.3 m NaBr, 20 mm imidazole, 0.2 mm β-mercaptoethanol and coupled batchwise to high performance nickel Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Sepharose was washed with binding buffer, and proteins were finally eluted in buffer containing 50 mm phosphate buffer, 0.3 m NaBr, 70 mm imidazole. In Vitro Protein Interaction—GST-ankyrin-B membrane-binding domain was absorbed to glutathione-Sepharose beads (20 ml of a 10% suspension) and incubated for 2 h at 25°C in a 100-μl final volume with increasing concentrations of 125I-ankyrin-B CT (63,600 cpm/pmol, labeled with Bolton-Hunter reagent). Samples were layered onto 200 μl of 20% glycerol dissolved in binding assay buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm NaEDTA, 0.2% Triton X-100, 1 mm NaN3, 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin), and beads with absorbed proteins were pellet by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 15 min. The tubes were frozen, and tips containing beads were cut off and assayed for 125I in a gamma counter. Values for nonspecific binding were determined using beads with bound GST and were subtracted. The beads were prepared as follows: A 50% slurry of PBS-washed glutathione-Sepharose beads were incubated overnight at 4 °C with either 5 μm purified GST ankyrin-B membrane-binding domain or GST. Beads were then washed with PBS and resuspended in binding assay buffer with the addition of bovine serum albumin. InsP3 receptor was purified as described previously (15Mohler P.J. Davis J.Q. Davis L.H. Hoffman J.A. Michaely P. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12980-12987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). An InsP3 receptor in vitro competition assay was performed by immobilizing GST-membrane-binding domain on glutathione resin and co-incubating with 1 nm of 125I-labeled InsP3 receptor (specific activity, 4,934,444 cpm/pmol) and increasing concentrations of full-length wild-type ankyrin-B-his, ankyrin-B 1597AAA-his, or ankyrin-B 37AAAA-his. Pellets were washed and assayed for 125I using a gamma counter. Values for nonspecific binding were determined by binding 125I-labeled InsP3 receptor to GST-bound glutathione beads and subtracted from total binding. Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—Purified ankyrin-B C-terminal domain and death domain were dialyzed in buffer containing 10 mm Na phosphate, pH 7.4, and 150 mm NaF. 300 μl of a 150 μg/ml solution was loaded onto a 1-mm path-length quartz cuvette. CD measurements were taken on an Aviv 62 DS model CD spectrometer at 25 °C between wavelengths of 260 and 190 nm. Spectra are the averages of five scans. Background signal was determined using buffer alone and subtracted from protein spectra followed by conversion to mean molar ellipticity. Cardiomyocytes—Neonatal cardiomyocytes were cultured from hearts of P1 mice as described previously (13Tuvia S. Buhusi M. Davis L. Reedy M. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 995-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). For transfection, purified endotoxin-free DNA was isolated from bacteria using Qiagen Midipreps (Valencia, CA). Eighty-six hours post-isolation, washed cardiomyocytes were transfected using Genefector reagent (Venn Nova, Pompano, FL) according to the manufacturer’s guidelines (using 2× DNA concentration and reagent at 2 mg/ml). Ankyrin-B Regulatory Domain Binds Specifically to the Membrane-binding Domain—220-kDa ankyrin-B has four known folded domains; an 89-kDa membrane-binding domain, a 62-kDa spectrin-binding domain, a 12-kDa death domain, and a 36-kDa C-terminal domain. The combination of death plus C-terminal domain is commonly referred to as the regulatory domain. Previous publications have implicated the ankyrin-B regulatory domain in defining ankyrin-B-specific function in neonatal cardiomyocytes (7Mohler P.J. Gramolini A.O. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10599-10607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 9Mohler P.J. Hoffman J.A. Davis J.Q. Abdi K.M. Kim C.R. Jones S.K. Davis L.H. Roberts K.F. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25798-25804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To evaluate if the regulatory domain of ankyrin-B promotes this activity through inter-domain interactions with other domains within the 220-kDa ankyrin-B polypeptide, we performed yeast two-hybrid protein interaction assays. We tested interactions of the regulatory domain (amino acids 1444-1840) with all four known folding domains of ankyrin-B (Fig. 1A). Yeast were co-transformed with vector containing ankyrin-B regulatory domain (fused with GAL4 DNA-binding domain) and vector containing either the membrane-binding domain, spectrin-binding domain, death domain, or C-terminal domain of ankyrin-B (fused with GAL4 DNA activation domain). We observed interaction only between the ankyrin-B regulatory domain and the ankyrin-B membrane-binding domain (Fig. 1B). The ankyrin-B regulatory domain showed no interaction with ankyrin-B spectrin-binding domain, death domain, or C-terminal domain even after prolonged incubations of more than 10 days (negative for growth on -AHLT plates, see “Materials and Methods”). These results identify a potential intramolecular interaction between the ankyrin-B regulatory domain and the membrane-binding domain. Our results also suggest that ankyrin-B death domains do not self-associate with significant affinity, in contrast to other death domain containing proteins (14Xiao T. Towb P. Wasserman S.A. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1999; 99: 545-555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). To determine if the ankyrin-B regulatory domain interacts with the membrane-binding domain in solution, we expressed and purified both domains as GST fusion proteins (GST-MBD) in bacteria and immobilized the GST-membrane-binding domain on glutathione resin. The GST tag was cleaved from the regulatory domain using Precision Protease (see “Materials and Methods”), and the purified domain was labeled with 125I using Bolton-Hunter reagent. The in vitro binding assay reveals these two domains associate with a Kd of 530 nm (Fig. 2A). The stoichiometry of the interaction is approximately one C-terminal domain per one membrane-binding domain based on Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 2B). This interaction is salt-sensitive, because increasing amounts of sodium chloride lead to a reduction in binding (Fig. 2C). This suggests the interaction is likely to occur between charged amino acids. As a control for nonspecific binding, agarose containing GST was incubated with equal amounts of radiolabeled regulatory domain, and these values were subtracted. Deletion and Alanine Mutagenesis Reveal a C-terminal Domain Binding Site—To determine if the observed interaction between regulatory and membrane-binding domains is required for ankyrin-B function, we generated loss-of-intramolecular interaction mutants. Initially, interaction of the ankyrin-B membrane-binding domain was tested with either the isolated death domain or C-terminal domain using the yeast two-hybrid assay. Ankyrin-B C-terminal domain interacts with ankyrin-B membrane-binding domain in yeast (Fig. 3). In contrast, within the limits of detection, ankyrin-B membrane-binding domain did not interact with the ankyrin-B death domain. Therefore, the ankyrin-B C-terminal domain alone harbors binding sites for the membrane-binding domain. This finding is consistent with the result that the death domain of ankyrin-B is not required for establishing ankyrin-B function in cardiomyocytes (7Mohler P.J. Gramolini A.O. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10599-10607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We further resolved the binding site on the C-terminal domain using deletion mutagenesis (Fig. 3). Truncations were generated by introduction of premature stop codons using site-directed mutagenesis (see “Materials and Methods”). The approach of using deletions is justified, because this domain is highly extended and does not contain significant secondary structure (see Fig. 8 and Table 2). Each C-terminal truncation mutant was co-transformed into yeast with a plasmid containing the ankyrin-B membrane-binding domain, and positive interaction was again assessed by growth on medium lacking AHLT. Interestingly, we observed interaction of C-terminal “prey” constructs as small as residues 1556-1630 (Fig. 3). In contrast, residues 1631-1840 did not interact with the membrane-binding domain. The N-terminal 74 amino acids of the ankyrin-B C-terminal domain are necessary and sufficient for inter-domain interaction with the ankyrin-B membrane-binding domain.TABLE 2Structural properties of ankyrin-BPropertiesValuesWTEED1597AAARAAR37AAAASedimentation coefficient, s20,waFrom sucrose gradient sedimentation.6.7 s6.3 s6.7 sPartial specific volume, vbEstimated from the amino acid composition.0.713 cm3/g0.713 cm3/g0.713 cm3/gStokes radius, RscDetermined from gel filtration on a calibrated Superose 6 column.7.8 nm8.2 nm7.8 nmMolecular weight, calculateddMolecular weight calculated from the equation, molecular weight = (6πNRss20,w)/(1 - vp20,w) (Eq. 1).208,912206,514208,912Molecular weight, actualeCalculated from the amino acid sequence.202,393202,233202,223Frictional ratio, f/f0fCalculated from the equation, f/f0 = Rs ((4πN/3 molecular weight (v + σρ)))⅓ (Eq. 2).1.781.881.78a From sucrose gradient sedimentation.b Estimated from the amino acid composition.c Determined from gel filtration on a calibrated Superose 6 column.d Molecular weight calculated from the equation, molecular weight = (6πNRss20,w)/(1 - vp20,w) (Eq. 1).e Calculated from the amino acid sequence.f Calculated from the equation, f/f0 = Rs ((4πN/3 molecular weight (v + σρ)))⅓ (Eq. 2). Open table in a new tab We next resolved the binding site on the ankyrin-B C-terminal domain to specific amino acid residues. We performed alanine mutagenesis of charged amino acids in the 74-amino acid region of the ankyrin-B C terminus. The approach to target charged amino acids was based on the observation that this interaction is salt-sensitive. Nine sites consisting of single or multiple charged residues were targeted for alanine substitution within the regulatory domain construct (Fig. 4A). These ankyrin-B C-terminal mutants were co-transformed into yeast with the plasmid containing the ankyrin-B membrane-binding domain. Interaction was completely abolished in one mutant where the amino acids Glu1597, Glu1598, and Asp1599 were converted to alanines (EED1597AAA) (Fig. 4B). The remaining eight mutants interact with the ankyrin-B membrane-binding domain. EED1597 thus represent a set of critical residues in the ankyrin-B C-terminal domain required for the ankyrin-B intramolecular interaction. Identification of a Membrane-binding Domain Docking Site for the C-terminal Domain—Membrane-binding domain truncation mutants and the yeast two-hybrid system were used to identify the binding site for the ankyrin-B C terminus on the ankyrin-B membrane-binding domain. Membrane-binding domain deletion constructs were designed based upon the boundaries of each ANK repeat (Fig. 5). The first tested deletion construct of the membrane-binding domain encompassed the known binding site for the InsP3 receptor (ANK repeats 19-24) (15Mohler P.J. Davis J.Q. Davis L.H. Hoffman J.A. Michaely P. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12980-12987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5). This construct did not interact with the C-terminal domain by yeast two-hybrid analysis. Additional deletions were generated to encompass ANK repeats 13-24 and 7-24, both of which were also negative for interaction. The remaining ANK repeats were added sequentially to the membrane-binding domain generating the constructs MBDR6-24, MBDR5-24, MBDR4-24, MBDR3-24, MBDR2-24, and MBDR1-24 (Fig. 5). Only the construct containing ANK repeats 1-24 showed interaction with the C-terminal domain. Exon one of ankyrin-B encodes a 30-amino acid stretch prior to the first ANK repeat and is not required for binding the C-terminal domain. We conclude that ANK repeat 1 contains a binding site for the C-terminal domain. ANK repeat does not contain obvious stretches of contiguous charged amino acid likely to interact with the negatively charged C-terminal domain (Fig. 6A). However, the atomic structure for thirteen ankyrin repeats in ankyrin-R reveals that each ANK repeat contains two anti-parallel α helices separated by a short linker (16Michaely P. Tomchick D.R. Machius M. Anderson R.G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6387-6396Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). We analyzed ANK repeat one using a molecular model of the repeat generated through the three-dimensional model prediction software, Robetta (robetta.bakerlab.org, David Baker). This model reveals the expected anti-parallel α helical structure determined through x-ray crystallography (Fig. 6A). Importantly the model shows the likely position of each amino acid within this repeat structure and reveals that the basic side chains of amino acids Arg37 and Arg40 are positioned together on the same surface of the first helix. We performed site-directed mutagenesis to convert the two residues to alanines and tested association of the C-terminal domain with this membrane-binding domain mutant in yeast (Fig. 6B). We observe that the ankyrin-B membrane-binding domain with amino acid substitutions, Arg37/Arg40 to Arg37/Arg40, abolishes interaction with the ankyrin-B C-terminal domain with likely minimal affect on the overall structure of the protein.

We have shown that SR-BII mediates HDL endocytosis through aclathrin-dependent, caveolae-independent pathway. Two candidate amino acid motifs were identified in the tail that could mediate association with clathrin-containing endocytic vesicles: a putative dileucine motif at position 492–493 and an overlapping tyrosine-based YXXZ motif starting at position 489. Although substitution of tyrosine at position 489 with alanine or histidine did not affect endocytosis, substitution L492A resulted in increased surface binding of HDL and reduced HDL particle endocytosis. Substitution L493A had a less dramatic effect. No other regions in the carboxyl-terminal tail appeared to contain motifs required for HDL endocytosis. Substitutions of leucine at position 492 with the hydrophobic amino acids valine or phenylalanine also reduced HDL endocytosis, stressing the importance of leucine at this position. Introducing the SR-BII YTPLL motif into the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic tail of SR-BI converted SR-BI into an endocytic receptor resembling SR-BII.

During the selective uptake process, only lipids are taken up from lipoproteins; apolipoproteins are not degraded (5.Glass C. Pittman R.C. Weinstein D.B. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 5435-5439Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). There is uncertainty as to whether the selective uptake process occurs at the cell surface or during uptake and retro-endocytosis of the ligand. In polarized cells, such as hepatocytes and transfected Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, evidence points toward SR-BI-dependent retro-endocytosis of at least part of the internalized HDL (6.Silver D.L.

In non-polarized cells, such as CHO, COS, and human embryonic kidney cells, selective uptake appears to occur at the cell membrane (9.Rodrigueza W.V. Thuahnai S.T. Temel R.E. Lund-Katz S.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1734: 44-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Furthermore, selective uptake could be observed in artificial membranes containing only purified SR-BI (14.Liu B. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34125-34135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The SR-BI gene gives rise to at least two mRNA splice variants (15.Webb N.R. de Villiers W.J.S. Connell P.M. de Beer F.C. van der Westhuyzen D.R. J.

The SR-BII variant is the main isoform in terms of mRNA levels in some tissues, exceeding SR-BI mRNA levels by up to 48-fold in brain cells (17.Thilakawardhana S. Everett D.M. Murdock P.R. Dingwall C. Owen J.S. Neurobiol. Aging. 2005; 26: 813-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and protein levels reach 10–15% of SR-BI in the liver (16.Webb N.R. Connell P.M. Graf G.A.

SR-BII immunoreactivity has also been detected in significant amounts in other tissues, such as testes (18.Azhar S. Reaven E. Mol. Cell Endocrinol. 2002; 195: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), retinal pigment epithelial cells (19.Duncan K.G. Bailey K.R. Kane J.P. Schwartz D.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 292: 1017-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and rabbit spleen, where protein levels of SR-BII are relatively high when compared with SR-BI (20.Ritsch A. Tancevski I.

Interestingly, the SR-BII isoform differs from SR-BI only in its entirely different, yet highly conserved, cytoplasmic carboxyl terminus. We recently showed that the carboxyl terminus of SR-BII must contain a signal that mediates predominantly intracellular expression in CHO cells and polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (21.Eckhardt E.R.

However, through endocytosis, SR-BII mediates the accumulation of significant amounts of ligand intracellularly, largely within the transferrin-positive endosomal recycling compartment (21.Eckhardt E.R. Cai L. Sun B. Webb N.R. van der Westhuyzen D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14372-14381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Selective uptake of cholesteryl ether from endocytosed HDL was rather inefficient, however, and virtually all of the selective uptake mediated by SR-BII could be accounted for by the surface pool of the receptor (21.Eckhardt E.R. Cai L. Sun B. Webb N.R. van der Westhuyzen D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14372-14381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The physiological significance of retro-endocytosis of lipoproteins via the SR-BII pathway remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to identify the mechanism by which SR-BII mediates uptake of lipoproteins as well as the signal in the carboxyl terminus that is responsible for its endocytic activity. Alignment of predicted and published SR-BII protein sequences identified two candidate motifs: a dileucine motif, which was conserved among all species, and an overlapping tyrosine-based motif, which was less conserved. It was found that SR-BII endocytosis occurs in a clathrin-dependent, caveolae-independent fashion. The conserved dileucine motif in the carboxyl terminus of SR-BII appeared essential for endocytosis, whereas the tyrosine residue was not required. No other motifs affecting endocytosis were found in the carboxyl terminus of SR-BII. Interestingly, introduction of the dileucine motif into the carboxyl terminus of SR-BI resulted in endocytosis of SR-BI. Cell Lines—CHO-A7-based clones expressing similar amounts (21.Eckhardt E.R.

CHO-A7 cells used for transient transfections were maintained in the same medium but without Geneticin. Isolation and Labeling of Ligands—Human HDL3 (d = 1.13 - 1.18 g/ml) was obtained from human plasma (donated by volunteers following a protocol approved by the University of Kentucky Internal Review Board) by KBr density gradient fractionation as described before (22.Strachan A.F. de Beer F.C. van der Westhuyzen D.R. Coetzee G.A. Biochem. J. 1988; 250: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), dialyzed against 150 mm NaCl, 0.01% EDTA, sterile-filtered, and stored under nitrogen gas at 4 °C. HDL3 apolipoproteins were labeled by iodination in presence of 125I (Amersham Biosciences) by the iodine monochloride method (23.Bilheimer D.W. Eisenberg S. Levy R.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 260: 212-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (1184) Google Scholar). HDL-associated cholesteryl ester was traced with non-hydrolyzable [1,2(n)-3H]cholesteryl oleoyl ether (Amersham Biosciences) according to the method of Gwynne and Mahaffee (24.Gwynne J.T. Mahaffee D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8141-8150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with the following modifications: [1,2(n)-3H]cholesteryl oleoyl ether was dried in a 12 × 75-mm glass borosilicate tube (20 μCi/mg of HDL protein), after which HDL and partially purified cholesteryl ester transfer protein were added. Following a 16-h incubation at 37 °C, HDL was refloated by ultracentrifugation at a density of 1.21 g/ml. The size and apolipoprotein integrity of labeled lipoproteins were verified by SDS-PAGE and non-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. The specific activity typically ranged between 50–100 and 3–10 dpm/ng of protein for 125I and 3H, respectively. For microscopy studies, fatty acid-free albumin or the protein fraction of HDL3 was labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 568 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) according to the manufacturer's instructions. HDL Cell Association and Selective Uptake—Cell association assays were performed in radiolabeled lipoprotein-containing medium with 0.5% bovine serum albumin instead of serum as described previously (16.Webb N.R. Connell P.M. Graf G.A. Smart E.J. de Villiers W.J.S. de Beer F.C. van der Westhuyzen D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15241-15248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). CHO-A7 cells were seeded on 12-well culture clusters at an initial density of 1 × 105 cells/cm2 and were grown until ∼50% confluency was reached. Plasmids were introduced with FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics; 0.5 μg DNA and 1.5 μl FuGENE/well) and were grown for an additional 48 h. Thereafter, the cells were either incubated with double-labeled HDL3 at 37 °C for indicated times or incubated with double-labeled HDL3 at 4 °C for 2 h, in the latter case with HEPES-buffered medium. Medium was removed, and cells were washed four times with ice-cold buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) containing albumin (2 mg/ml) followed by two washes in the same buffer without albumin. Cells were then solubilized in 0.1 n NaOH for 60 min at room temperature, and protein content and radioactivity were measured in this lysate; 125I represented HDL protein association according to the protein tracer, and 3H represented cholesteryl ester accumulation, calculated from cell-associated cholesteryl-ether tracer. The non-iodide, trichloroacetic acid-soluble 125I in cell media corresponding to degraded 125I-apolipoprotein was assayed as described (16.Webb N.R. Connell P.M. Graf G.A.

Values are expressed as apparent HDL protein uptake assuming the uptake of intact holoparticles. This was done to compare association of both tracers on the same basis. Selective uptake is defined as 3H - (125I cell-associated + 125I degraded) and represents the uptake of cholesteryl ester that cannot be accounted for by the internalization of intact particles. Receptor-specific values were calculated as the difference between CHO-SR-Bx and CHO-A7 values. Selective uptake efficiency was defined as the amount of selective uptake normalized for total (i.e. surface bound and internalized) cell association of 125I-HDL. Inhibition of Endocytosis—The formation of clathrin-coated pits was disrupted by different treatments. Potassium depletion was performed according to the method of Larkin et al. (25.Larkin J.M.

Caveolae-dependent endocytosis was inhibited by preincubating cells for 2 h with serum-free medium containing 200 μm genistein (Sigma) (27.Singh R.D. Puri V. Valiyaveettil J.T. Marks D.L. Bittman R.

Generation of Point Mutations in SR-Bx—Point mutations were introduced in the carboxyl terminus of full-length murine SR-BI or SR-BII cDNA that had been subcloned into pCMV5 or pcDNA5 FRT/TO (Invitrogen). Amino acid substitutions were introduced with the PCR-based QuikChange kit from Stratagene, using synthetic DNA oligonucleotides (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA) carrying the desired mutation. Mutants were verified by DNA sequence analysis, and the predicted protein size (∼82 kDa) was verified by immunoblotting using the Red-1 antibody (16.Webb N.R. Connell P.M. Graf G.A.

Microscopy—CHO-A7 cells were grown on glass coverslips, transfected with FuGENE 6, and maintained for an additional 48 h. The medium was changed on the morning of the experiment. Fluorescently labeled ligand was added directly to the medium, at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml, followed by incubations at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for the indicated amount of time. Thereafter, cells were washed seven times with cold phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (at room temperature), and subsequently mounted on glass slides with VECTASHIELD mounting medium containing nuclear stain 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories). Slides were observed under an Olympus BX51 fluorescence microscope. Statistical Analysis—Statistics were calculated with Graphpad's Prizm software, using one-way analyses of variance with post-hoc Bonferroni's test. Statistical significant differences, with p values lower than 0.05, are indicated with asterisks in Figs. 2 and 6.FIGURE 6Selective uptake efficiency (i.e. selective uptake divided by cell association) by CHO cells expressing SR-BI, SR-BII, and indicated mutants.

SR-BII, in contrast, mediated extensive endocytosis of HDL, through a transferrin-positive pathway (21.Eckhardt E.R. Cai L. Sun B. Webb N.R. van der Westhuyzen D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14372-14381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To elucidate the endocytic mechanism underlying HDL uptake by SR-BII, we first studied uptake of HDL, fluorescently labeled at the protein moiety, in CHO-SRBII cells after a short potassium depletion treatment to block clathrin-coated pit formation (25.Larkin J.M. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Anderson R.G. Cell. 1983; 33: 273-285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, potassium depletion led to a marked decrease of HDL endocytosis by CHO-SRBII cells. Cells grown in potassium-containing medium, however, showed intracellular localization of the ligand, as we have reported before (21.Eckhardt E.R. Cai L. Sun B. Webb N.R. van der Westhuyzen D.R. J.

In the case of CHO-SRBI cells, the bulk of cell-associated HDL was found at the cell surface, both in control cells and in treated cells.

Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 389-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar), had similar results (not shown). For both receptor isoforms, potassium depletion did not alter 4 °C binding of 125I-HDL, indicating that the steady-state amount of surface receptors was unaltered by the treatment (Fig. 2A). At 37 °C, however, cell association (the sum of surface-bound and internalized ligand) in potassium-depleted CHO-SRBII cells was significantly decreased when compared with untreated cells (Fig. 2B). This is in line with an inhibitory effect of potassium depletion on intracellular accumulation of HDL (Fig. 1). In the case of SR-BI, potassium depletion resulted in a slight but significant increase in 37 °C cell association. No effect of potassium depletion on HDL-cell association was seen in receptor-deficient control cells. Surprisingly, although potassium depletion had little effect on selective uptake by SR-BI, selective uptake by SR-BII was actually significantly increased following the treatment (Fig. 2C), despite unaltered surface receptor numbers in the steady-state (Fig. 2A). The explanation for this is unclear. Perhaps the displacement of SR-BII out of clathrin-coated pits to other areas of the cell surface enhances selective uptake efficiency. Nevertheless, it can be concluded that blocking SR-BII-dependent HDL endocytosis does not impair selective uptake. Genistein, an inhibitor of caveolae-dependent uptake (28.Sharma D.K. Brown J.C. Choudhury A. Peterson T.E. Holicky E. Marks D.L. Simari R. Parton R.G. Pagano R.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 3114-3122Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), had no effect on HDL uptake by either CHO-SRBI or CHO-SRBII cells (Fig. 3), whereas the compound potently inhibited uptake of Alexa Fluor-labeled albumin, a marker for caveolae-dependent endocytosis (29.Schnitzer J.E. Oh P. Pinney E. Allard J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1217-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3).FIGURE 3Effect of genistein, an inhibitor of caveolae-dependent endocytosis, on HDL uptake. CHO cells expressing SR-BI or SR-BII were preincubated in serum-free medium for 2 h, either with or without 200 μm genistein. Thereafter, Alexa Fluor 488-labeled HDL3 (10 μg/ml) or Alexa Fluor 488-labeled albumin (10 μg/ml) was added, and cells were further incubated for 30 min, fixed, and mounted on a cover slide for fluorescence microscopy.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Tyr-489 Is Not Required for Endocytosis of HDL by SR-BII—Previously published data showed that deletion of the SR-BI carboxyl terminus did not affect surface expression of SR-BI in CHO cells (21.Eckhardt E.R.

We therefore hypothesized that the strongly conserved carboxyl terminus of SR-BII (16.Webb N.R. Connell P.M. Graf G.A. Smart E.J. de Villiers W.J.S. de Beer F.C. van der Westhuyzen D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15241-15248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4) must contain a motif that mediates receptor endocytosis. Alignment of hitherto known SR-BII cDNA sequences as well as SR-BII sequences predicted based on published SR-BI data, shown in Fig. 4, revealed a putative YXXZ (Z representing a hydrophobic amino acid) motif (30.Bonifacino J.S. Dell'Angelica E.C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar) at amino acid positions 489–492 with a partially overlapping, completely conserved dileucine motif (Leu-492–Leu-493). It should be noted, however, that, in contrast to the dileucine repeat, the tyrosine residue is not entirely conserved; in the rabbit, this residue is replaced with a histidine (20.Ritsch A. Tancevski I. Schgoer W. Pfeifhofer C. Gander R. Eller P. Foeger B. Stanzl U. Patsch J.R. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 45: 214-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of the carboxyl terminus of SR-BII was carried out to define amino acid residues necessary for SR-BII-mediated HDL endocytosis. Constructs encoding wild-type SR-BI or SR-BII or mutant isoforms were transiently transfected into CHO-A7 cells grown on glass coverslips. Endocytosis was determined microscopically after incubation with Alexa Fluor 568-labeled HDL3 (10 μg/ml HDL protein, 40–60 min, 37 °C). Table 1 shows the analyzed mutations and summarizes the effect of the mutations on HDL endocytosis by SR-BII.TABLE 1Mutational analysis of the carboxyl terminus of SR-BI and SR-BII The putative endocytosis signal in SR-BII is underlined, point-mutations are in bold.

To address the question of whether Tyr-489 is required for HDL endocytosis by SR-BII, this residue was replaced by histidine or alanine, and the ability of the mutant receptors to mediate endocytosis of Alexa Fluor 568-labeled HDL3 at 37 °C was studied in transiently transfected CHO-A7 cells. As shown in Fig. 5D, mutant Y489A still mediated HDL endocytosis; the same was observed for mutant Y489H (not shown). Thus, tyrosine 489 appears not to be required for endocytosis of HDL. The Dileucine Motif Leu-492–Leu-493 Is Required for Intracellular Accumulation of HDL—Dileucine motifs are known to mediate endocytosis into endosomal compartments (31.Bonifacino J.S. Traub L.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 395-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (1614) Google Scholar) and usually correspond to a (DE)XXXL(LI) or DXXLL consensus. Despite the fact that SR-BII lacks the acidic residue(s) preceding Leu-492, we nevertheless tested the hypothesis that the strongly conserved dileucine repeat Leu-492–Leu-493 is required for SR-BII endocytosis. Interestingly, substitution L492A resulted in a virtual abolishment of intracellular accumulation of Alexa Fluor-labeled HDL in CHO cells (Fig. 5E). Substitution L493A had a less striking effect, with only partial loss of endocytic activity (Fig. 5F), whereas Thr-490 and Pro-491 appeared not critical for the SR-BII phenotype (not shown; Table 1). Further, we tested whether leucine, one of the most hydrophobic amino acids, is required at position 492 or whether it can be replaced by another hydrophobic amino acid such as the structurally similar hydrophobic amino acid valine or by phenylalanine, which carries a “bulky” side chain. Interestingly, as seen in Fig. 5G, CHO cells expressing the L492V mutant accumulated HDL mainly on the cell surface, not dissimilar from wild-type SR-BI but in strong contrast with wild-type SR-BII. The same was observed for L492F (not shown). Thus, leucine 492 is specifically required for SR-BII endocytosis and might be part of an unorthodox dileucine motif. Introduction of the SR-BII Endocytic Motif into SR-BI Results in HDL Endocytosis—The carboxyl terminus of SR-BI contains a tyrosine residue at position 490 (Table 1), which is highly conserved, and a leucine residue at position 494. To test whether introduction of the YTPLL motif into SR-BI would be sufficient to mediate endocytosis, the amino acids in between Tyr-490 and Leu-494 were substituted with the amino acid sequence TPL (Table 1). Strikingly, when introduced into CHO cells, this SR-BI mutant mediated endocytosis of HDL similarly to SR-BII (Fig. 5H). These results show that the YTPLL residue is sufficient to mediate endocytosis. Furthermore, since the YTP residues are dispensable for endocytosis by SR-BII, these results strongly suggest that the dileucine motif is the mediator of endocytosis. Effect of Mutations in the Carboxyl Terminus of SR-BII on Selective Uptake Efficiency—To determine whether mutations in the endocytic motif of SR-BII that block HDL endocytosis also affect selective uptake efficiency, wild-type SR-BI and SR-BII as well as various mutant forms of these receptors were transfected into CHO-A7 cells. Non-transfected and transfected cells were then incubated with 125I/3H-labeled HDL3, and receptor-mediated selective uptake efficiency was determined by measuring the ratio of selective uptake per unit of cell association. In agreement with published results (21.Eckhardt E.R. Cai L. Sun B. Webb N.R. van der Westhuyzen D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14372-14381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), SR-BII mediated selective uptake from HDL with reduced efficiency when compared with SR-BI (Fig. 6), most likely due to the fact that HDL endocytosed by SR-BII did not significantly contribute to selective uptake. All mutants that abolished HDL endocytosis showed statistically significant increases in selective uptake efficiency when compared with SR-BII, reaching similar efficiencies as observed with wild-type SR-BI. Interestingly, two SR-BII mutants that maintained endocytic capacity, i.e. the Y489A mutant and the mutant lacking the residues following the endocytic motif (E494stop), showed increased selective uptake efficiency (Fig. 6) when compared with wild-type SR-BII. These results suggest that these mutants deliver HDL to different cellular compartments than SR-BII and that this allows for selective uptake to occur. In the present study, we show that SR-BII, a protein encoded by alternatively spliced SR-BI mRNA, undergoes endocytosis by a clathrin-dependent, caveolae-independent mechanism. Endocytosis appeared to be mediated by a unique signal in the cytoplasmic carboxyl terminus, which was identified as a conserved dileucine-motif. When compared with previously described dileucine motifs, the putative dileucine motif of SR-BII is somewhat unusual. Although it carries a serine residue after the dileucine repeat, the motif lacks the preceding acidic amino acids conforming to the consensus (DE)XXX-L(LI) or DXXLL (31.Bonifacino J.S. Traub L.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 395-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (1614) Google Scholar). These dileucine motifs mediate rapid endocytosis and generally target the receptor to late endosomes or lysosomes (31.Bonifacino J.S. Traub L.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 395-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (1614) Google Scholar). One example of a protein with such a signal is lysosomal integral membrane protein-II (LIMP-II), which belongs to the same scavenger receptor family as CD36, SR-BI, and SR-BII. However, SR-BII does not appear to direct HDL to lysosomes since apolipoprotein degradation is negligible (21.Eckhardt E.R. Cai L. Sun B. Webb N.R. van der Westhuyzen D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14372-14381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Perhaps the lack of the acidic residues prior to the dileucine repeat, which might decrease lysosomal targeting efficiency (31.Bonifacino J.S. Traub L.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 395-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (1614) Google Scholar, 32.Rous B.A. Reaves B.J. Ihrke G. Briggs J.A. Gray S.R. Stephens D.J. Banting G. Luzio J.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1071-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), prevents lysosomal targeting of SR-BII. Interestingly, introduction of the SR-BII dileucine motif into the carboxyl terminus of SR-BI confers the SR-BII-like endocytic phenotype to an otherwise unaltered SR-BII, providing additional evidence that this motif alone is sufficient to target receptors for internalization. We previously showed that SR-BII-mediated selective lipid uptake from HDL is less efficient than selective uptake by SR-BI and argued that endocytosed HDL does not contribute significantly to the selective uptake process (21.Eckhardt E.R. Cai L. Sun B. Webb N.R. van der Westhuyzen D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14372-14381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Our present data indicate that SR-BII mutants that are deficient in endocytosis have enhanced selective uptake activity. In addition, blocking SR-BII-mediated HDL endocytosis by potassium depletion actually enhanced selective uptake. We interpret these results to suggest that localization of the receptor to the cell surface is optimal for selective uptake. SR-BI-dependent endocytosis of HDL has been reported by various groups (6.Silver D.L. Wang N. Xiao X. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25287-25293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 7.Wustner D. Mondal M. Huang A. Maxfield F.R. J.

Acta. 2005; 1734: 44-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), but increasing evidence points against a role for HDL endocytosis in selective uptake. As recently shown by Nieland et al. (13.Nieland T.J. Ehrlich M. Krieger M. Kirchhausen T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1734: 44-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), for example, blocking of SR-BI-dependent HDL endocytosis appeared not to inhibit selective uptake, and blocking of selective uptake by specific inhibitors did not affect endocytosis of HDL. Furthermore, selective uptake can be mediated by purified SR-BI inserted into artificial membranes (13.Nieland T.J. Ehrlich M. Krieger M. Kirchhausen T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1734: 44-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and electron microscopic studies showed that little HDL is taken up by cells that naturally exhibit strong SR-BI-dependent selective uptake activities (10.Peng Y. Akmentin W. Connelly M.A. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Williams D.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 384-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 33.Reaven E. Chen Y.D. Spicher M. Azhar S. J. Clin. Investig. 1984; 74: 1384-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Thus, whatever the functional significance of HDL endocytosis by SR-BI or SR-BII, it does not seem to be related to selective lipid uptake from the lipoprotein. HDL endocytosis by SR-BII appears unique in this respect, however, since mutations in the carboxyl terminus of SR-BII that did not abolish endocytosis did not show the reduced selective uptake efficiency characteristic for SR-BII. This is somewhat unexpected and could indicate that endocytosis of HDL does not necessarily preclude selective uptake. Possibly, the endocytic route taken by wild-type SR-BII is different from mutant SR-BII and targets HDL to compartments where selective uptake is not efficient. Nevertheless, both wild-type SR-BII (21.Eckhardt E.R. Cai L. Sun B. Webb N.R. van der Westhuyzen D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14372-14381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and SR-BII mutants that retained endocytic activity (data not shown) do not degrade significant amounts of HDL apolipoproteins. Although SR-BII protein levels in most tissues are relatively low when compared with SR-BI, it cannot be excluded that some of the severe occlusive atherosclerosis displayed by SR-BI(II)/ApoE double knockout mice (34.Braun A. Trigatti B.L. Post M.J. Sato K. Simons M. Edelberg J.M. Rosenberg R.D. Schrenzel M. Krieger M. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 270-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar) can be attributed to lack of SR-BII. It is not likely that SR-BII plays a role in bulk HDL metabolism, but the isoform might nevertheless indirectly be involved in cholesterol homeostasis. SR-BII recycles HDL in a transferrin-positive peri-centriolar compartment (21.Eckhardt E.R. Cai L. Sun B. Webb N.R. van der Westhuyzen D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14372-14381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) close to the nucleus. HDL carries many biologically active hydrophobic compounds that are ligands for nuclear receptors, including oxysterols, fat-soluble vitamins, estrogens, and bile salts, compounds that normally have to diffuse across the plasma membrane and through the cytoplasm to reach the nucleus. Perhaps efficient internalization and peri-nuclear recycling of HDL by SR-BII enhances diffusion of such compounds into the nucleus and thus potentiates the cellular response; this is a possibility we are currently investigating. Additionally, SR-BII-mediated retro-endocytosis of HDL, a potent acceptor of free cholesterol, might affect the endocytic recycling compartment itself by altering its cholesterol content, thus potentially affecting endocytic pathways of other receptors. Recycling of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored receptors, for example, strongly depends on endosomal cholesterol content (35.Mayor S. Sabharanjak S. Maxfield F.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4626-4638Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 36.Maxfield F.R. Wustner D. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 891-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Taken together, we have identified an endocytic motif in the carboxyl terminus of SR-BII that mediates clathrin-dependent endocytosis of the receptor and have provided additional evidence against involvement of HDL endocytosis in selective uptake."

Two metabolic roles have been ascribed to this folate derivative. It has been proposed to 1) serve as a storage form of folate because it is chemically stable and accumulates in seeds and spores and 2) regulate folate-dependent one-carbon metabolism by inhibiting folate-dependent enzymes, specifically targeting folate-dependent de novo purine biosynthesis. Methenyltetrahydrofolate synthetase (MTHFS) is the only enzyme that metabolizes 5-formylTHF and catalyzes its ATP-dependent conversion to 5,10-methenylTHF. This reaction determines intracellular 5-formylTHF concentrations and converts 5-formylTHF into an enzyme cofactor. The regulation and metabolic role of MTHFS in one-carbon metabolism was investigated in vitro and in human neuroblastoma cells. Steady-state kinetic studies revealed that 10-formylTHF, which exists in chemical equilibrium with 5,10-methenylTHF, acts as a tight binding inhibitor of mouse MTHFS. [6R]-10-formylTHF inhibited MTHFS with a Ki of 150 nm, and [6R,S]-10-formylTHF triglutamate inhibited MTHFS with a Ki of 30 nm. MTHFS is the first identified 10-formylTHF tight-binding protein. Isotope tracer studies in neuroblastoma demonstrate that MTHFS enhances de novo purine biosynthesis, indicating that MTHFS-bound 10-formylTHF facilitates de novo purine biosynthesis. Feedback metabolic regulation of MTHFS by 10-formylTHF indicates that 5-formylTHF can only accumulate in the presence of 10-formylTHF, providing the first evidence that 5-formylTHF is a storage form of excess formylated folates in mammalian cells. The sequestration of 10-formylTHF by MTHFS may explain why de novo purine biosynthesis is protected from common disruptions in the folate-dependent one-carbon network. 5-Formyltetrahydrofolate (5-formylTHF) is the only folate derivative that does not serve as a cofactor in folate-dependent one-carbon metabolism.

Bailey L.B. Folate in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1995: 1-22Google Scholar). Methionine can be adenylated to form S-adenosylmethionine, which serves as a cofactor and methyl donor for numerous cellular reactions, including histone, DNA, RNA, phospholipid, and catecholamine methylation (2.Finkelstein J.D. Nutr. Rev. 2000; 58: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 3.Finkelstein J.D. Semin. Thromb. Hemostasis. 2000; 26: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 4.Clark S. Banfield K. Carmel R. Jacobsen D.W. Homocysteine in Health and Disease. Cambridge University Press, New York2001: 63-78Google Scholar). Disruptions in the folate-mediated one-carbon metabolic network are common and result from single nucleotide polymorphisms in genes that encode folate-dependent enzymes, from low intracellular folate concentrations, and/or from other environmental factors (5.Bailey L.B. Gregory III, J.F. J. Nutr. 1999; 129: 919-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 6.Suh J.R. Herbig A.K. Stover P.J. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2001; 21: 255-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). De novo thymidylate synthesis and homocysteine remethylation are highly sensitive to network disruptions, which result in increased incorporation of dUTP into DNA, elevated cellular homocysteine, and impaired S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methylation reactions. De novo purine biosynthesis is less sensitive to network disruptions, although the mechanisms for this protection are unknown. Impaired folate metabolism increases risk for pathologies and developmental anomalies, including epithelial cancers, cardiovascular disease, and neural tube defects (7.Stover P.J. Nutr.

Because of its role in nucleotide biosynthesis and cellular methylation reactions, this network continues to be an attractive target for the development of antiproliferative drugs (8.Kisliuk R.L.

Bailey L.B. Folate in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1995: 1-22Google Scholar). Folates are transported across cell membranes as monoglutamate derivatives that are converted to folate polyglutamates by the enzyme folylpolyglutamate synthetase (1.Shane B. Bailey L.B. Folate in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1995: 1-22Google Scholar, 11.Moran R.G. Semin. Oncol. 1999; 26: 24-32PubMed Google Scholar). The polyglutamate chain serves both to retain folates within the cell and to increase the affinity of folate derivatives for folate binding enzymes (1.Shane B. Bailey L.B. Folate in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1995: 1-22Google Scholar). Typically, folate polyglutamates bind to proteins two to three orders of magnitude tighter than corresponding monoglutamate forms (12.Schirch V. Strong W.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 269: 371-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). There are five naturally occurring one-carbon-substituted forms of THF (Fig. 2). 5-MethylTHF carries the one-carbon unit at the oxidation level of methanol for the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine. 5,10-MethyleneTHF carries the one-carbon unit at the oxidation level of formaldehyde for thymidylate biosynthesis. Three THF derivatives, 10-formylTHF, 5-formylTHF, and 5,10-methenylTHF, carry the one-carbon unit at the oxidation level of formate. Of these forms, only 10-formylTHF is an enzyme cofactor and supplies the number 2 and number 8 carbons of the purine ring. Folate-dependent biosynthetic enzymes show absolute substrate specificity for a single folate cofactor. However, other one-carbon-substituted forms often function as potent enzyme inhibitors that regulate flux through the network (1.Shane B. Bailey L.B. Folate in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1995: 1-22Google Scholar, 13.Wagner C. Bailey L.B. Folate in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1995: 23-42Google Scholar). Although 5-formylTHF is the most stable natural folate, little is known about its physiological role and regulation in mammalian systems. 5-FormylTHF is synthesized from 5,10-methenylTHF in a reaction catalyzed by serine hydroxymethyltransferase (14.Stover P.

In prokaryotes, there is evidence that 5-formylTHF is a storage form of folate and that its accumulation in dormant cells, including seeds and spores, is mediated by alterations in MTHFS expression (19.Stover P. Schirch V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 102-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 20.Kruschwitz H.L. McDonald D. Cossins E.A. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28757-28763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, 5-formylTHF is not known to account for more than 10–15% of total folate in mammalian cells (19.Stover P. Schirch V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 102-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In mammalian systems, 5-formylTHF has been shown to inhibit several folate-dependent enzymes. 5-FormylTHF polyglutamates are tight binding inhibitors of serine hydroxymethyltransferase and phosphoribosylaminoimidazole carboxamide formyltransferase (21.Girgis S. Suh J.R. Jolivet J. Stover P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4729-4734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 22.Bertrand R. Jolivet J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8843-8846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to catalyzing 5-formylTHF synthesis, serine hydroxymethyltransferase also catalyzes the interconversion of serine and THF to glycine and methyleneTHF, a reaction that generates one-carbon units for purine, thymidine, and methionine biosynthesis (21.Girgis S. Suh J.R. Jolivet J. Stover P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4729-4734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Phosphoribosylaminoimidazole carboxamide formyltransferase catalyzes the incorporation of formate into the C2 position of the purine ring. Inhibition of MTHFS in human MCF-7 cells by exposure to the MTHFS antifolate inhibitor, 5-formyltetrahydrohomofolate (5-formyl-THHF), results in an accumulation of cellular folate as 5-formylTHF. This creates a purine auxotrophy because elevated levels of 5-formylTHF inhibit phosphoribosylaminoimidazole carboxamide formyltransferase (22.Bertrand R. Jolivet J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8843-8846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it has been proposed that alterations in cellular 5-formylTHF concentrations, mediated through changes in MTHFS activity, may regulate purine biosynthesis (19.Stover P. Schirch V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 102-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In this study, we elucidated a mechanism for feedback metabolic regulation of MTHFS by 10-formylTHF and provide evidence that this regulatory mechanism supports a role for 5-formylTHF as storage form of folate in mammalian cells. Furthermore, we discovered a novel role for MTHFS-bound 10-formylTHF in the regulation of de novo purine biosynthesis. Materials—MES, HEPES, and Tris were purchased from Sigma. ATP was purchased from Roche Applied Science. [6S]-5-formylTHF (the natural isomer) and [6R,S]-5-FormylTHF were a generous gift from Eprova AG. Folic acid, 10-formylfolic acid, [6R,S]-5-formyltetrahydropteroate, 6-methylpterin, 5-formyltetrahydrofolate triglutamate, and folic acid polyglutamates were from Schircks Laboratories. Homofolate (NSC 79249) was a generous gift from Dr. Roy Kisliuk, Tufts University. All other materials were of high quality and obtained from various commercial vendors. Synthesis of Folate and Antifolate Derivatives—[6R]-10-formylTHF (the natural isomer) was synthesized from [6S]-5-formylTHF as described previously (23.Stover P. Schirch V. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 202: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). 5-Formyl, 6-methyltetrahydropterin and 5-formyltetrahydrohomofolic acid were synthesized from 6-methylpterin and homofolic acid, respectively, as described by others (11.Moran R.G. Semin. Oncol. 1999; 26: 24-32PubMed Google Scholar). Both homofolic acid and 6-methylpterin were reduced to tetrahydrohomofolic acid and 6-methyltetrahydropterin, respectively, by reduction over palladium(II) oxide hydrate in water or formic acid, respectively; formylation at N5 was achieved by the immediate addition of formic acid and N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N′-ethylcarbodiimide at pH 4.0 as described previously (24.Moran R.G. Keyomarsi K. Colman P.D. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 122: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). All synthesized compounds were purified by anion exchange chromatography and desalted by gravity filtration on a 0.5 × 64-inch G-10 Sephadex column using water as the mobile phase as described elsewhere (23.Stover P. Schirch V. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 202: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Samples were lyophilized and their identity verified by UV spectroscopy and 1H NMR. Homology Model Construction—A model of the mouse MTHFS protein was constructed using the crystal structure of Mycoplasma pneumoniae MTHFS with ADP, phosphate, and 5-formylTHF bound (PDB code 1U3G; Fig. 3) (25.Chen S. Shin D.H. Pufan R. Kim R. Kim S.H. Proteins. 2004; 56: 839-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 26.Chen S. Yakunin A.F. Proudfoot M. Kim R. Kim S.H. Proteins. 2005; 61: 433-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). A BLAST search of the Swiss-Prot data base (27.Boeckmann B. Bairoch A. Apweiler R. Blatter M.C. Estreicher A. Gasteiger E. Martin M.J. Michoud K. O'Donovan C. Phan I. Pilbout S. Schneider M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (2822) Google Scholar), using the SIB BLAST Network Service (28.Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar), revealed a number of sequences related to mouse MTHFS. A set of eight sequences comprising three mammalian and five bacterial proteins, including the murine and M. pneumoniae MTHFS enzymes, was aligned using ClustalW (29.Higgins D.G. Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 383-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar). A small adjustment was made to the location of insertions in the murine relative to the M. pneumoniae sequence to minimize interruption of secondary structure elements by the insertions. The SWISS-MODEL homology modeling server (30.Schwede T. Kopp J. Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3381-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (4537) Google Scholar) was used to generate a model of mouse MTHFS. The M. pneumoniae and mouse sequences are 28% identical and 70% similar, and the alignment of the portions of the sequence that are involved in ATP and THF binding is unambiguous. The conformations and locations of inserted loops are uncertain, but none of these is close enough to the active site to be directly involved in catalysis. Protein Expression and Purification—Recombinant murine MTHFS protein was expressed and purified as described elsewhere (31.Anguera M.C. Liu X. Stover P.J. Protein Expression Purif. 2004; 35: 276-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Steady-state Kinetics—MTHFS activity was monitored by measuring the increase in 5,10-methenylTHF production with time at 37 °C in 1-ml cuvettes using a spectrophotometer; 5,10-methenylTHF has a unique absorbance maximum at λ, 355 nm (ϵ, 25,100). Reaction mixtures contained 100 mm MES, pH 6.0, 20 mm MgATP. Reactions were initiated by the addition of MTHFS to 70 nm. Km and kcat values were determined from Lineweaver-Burke plots, and reported values are the average of three experiments. To determine the Km for [6R,S]-5-formylTHFGlu3, final substrate concentrations ranged from 0.1 to 1.5 μm. For all inhibition experiments, 70 nm MTHFS was preincubated with the inhibitors for 2–4 min in the reaction mixture; the reaction was then initiated by adding [6S]-5-formylTHF. Ki values were determined from Dixon plots, and reported values are the average of at least two independent determinations. Purine Biosynthesis Assay—SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells expressing the human MTHFS cDNA (SH-SY5YMTHFS) have been described elsewhere (19.Stover P. Schirch V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 102-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 31.Anguera M.C. Liu X. Stover P.J. Protein Expression Purif. 2004; 35: 276-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). These cells were maintained in Minimal Essential Medium, alpha modification (Hyclone) supplemented with 11% fetal bovine serum. For tracer experiments, fetal bovine serum was dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline for over 24 h with four buffer changes to remove folate and other small molecules and then charcoal treated to remove any residual folate. The tracer medium was Defined Minimal Essential Medium (Hyclone) that lacked glycine, serine, methionine, hypoxanthine, and folate but was supplemented with 200 μm methionine, 20 nm leucovorin, 2 nm [3H]hypoxanthine, and 20 μm [14C]formate. Cells were split 1:3 and grown in 6-well plates at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in tracer medium until confluent and harvested. The cell pellets were stored at -40 °C. Nuclear DNA was isolated using a DNA blood kit from Quiagen and isotope levels quantified on a Beckman LS6500 scintillation counter in dual dpm mode. For HPLC separation of nucleosides, cells were grown to confluence and harvested. DNA was digested to nucleosides prior to separation by HPLC, using procedures described elsewhere (32.Friso S. Choi S.W. Dolnikowski G.G. Selhub J. Anal. Chem. 2002; 74: 4526-4531Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Peaks corresponding to nucleosides were identified from standards, collected, and isotope levels quantified. Determinants of MTHFS Substrate Specificity—The contribution of all folate chemical moieties to substrate binding and catalysis was elucidated for recombinant murine MTHFS (Table 1 and Fig. 1). [6R,S]-5-formylTHFGlu3, an endogenous form of cellular folate, is a substrate for murine MTHFS (Km, 0.4 μm; kcat/Km, 225). Previous studies have shown that the unnatural [6R]-5-formylTHF is not a substrate or inhibitor of mammalian MTHFS enzymes; therefore, the Km value for [6S]-5-formylTHFGlu3 is likely 0.2 μm (33.Hopkins S. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5618-5622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Bertrand R. MacKenzie R.E. Jolivet J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 911: 154-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The Km for [6S]-5-formylTHF is 10 μm (kcat/Km, 6.0), in agreement with values determined for rabbit and human MTHFS (22.Bertrand R. Jolivet J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8843-8846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Hopkins S. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5618-5622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the loss of the diglutamate chain increases the Km by 25-fold and decreases the substrate specificity (kcat/Km) by 97%. [6R,S]-5-formyltetrahydropteroate, an unnatural derivative that lacks a glutamate moiety, is also a substrate (Km, 33 μm; kcat/Km, 1.8), indicating that the Glu1 moiety of 5-formylTHF makes only minor contributions to the Km and substrate specificity (kcat/Km). [6R,S]-5-formyl, 6-methyltetrahydropterin, which lacks the p-aminobenzoic acid and glutamate moieties, at a concentration of 60 μm did not inhibit the MTHFS-catalyzed conversion of 10 μm [6S]-5-formylTHF to 5, 10-methenylTHF, demonstrating that the p-aminobenzoate moiety of folate is essential for substrate binding. Collectively, these data indicate that pterins lack affinity for MTHFS and that the glutamate polypeptide decreases Km and increases substrate specificity.TABLE 1Substrate specificity of MTHFS All reactions were carried out at 37 °C in 100 mm MES, pH 6.0.SubstrateKmkcatkcat/Kmμmmin–1[6R,S]-5-formylTHPteroate33 ± 1060 ± 201.8[6S]-5-formylTHF10 ± 364 ± 166.4[6R,S]-5-formylTHFGlu30.4 ± 0.190 ± 30225.0 Open table in a new tab Inhibition of MTHFS—Previous studies of human MTHFS protein have demonstrated that folic acid, THF, and 5-methylTHF are weak competitive inhibitors of human MTHFS (34.Bertrand R. MacKenzie R.E. Jolivet J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 911: 154-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Inhibition of MTHFS by 10-formylTHF has never been investigated. The inhibition of recombinant murine MTHFS by folic acid and 10-formyl-substituted folate derivatives was examined and compared with inhibition by the synthetic antifolate and known MTHFS competitive inhibitor, 5-formylTHHF (Table 2). 5-FormylTHHF inhibited MTHFS activity with a Ki of 700 nm. Folic acid, an oxidized and unnatural form of folate present in vitamin supplements, weakly inhibited MTHFS activity (Ki, 58 μm). The Ki for folic acid triglutamate and pentaglutamate was reduced by 70 and 98%, respectively, compared with folic acid; the Ki for folic acid pentaglutamate was similar to that determined for 5-formylTHHF. The tighter binding resulting from the addition of the polyglutamate chain illustrates the importance of the polyglutamate binding site as a critical determinant of inhibitor affinity. N10-Formyl substitution markedly decreased the Ki for folate derivatives; inhibition of all N10-substituted folates was competitive with the substrate, [6S]-5-formylTHF. N10-Formylation of folic acid decreased the Ki value by nearly 80%. Similarly, [6R,S]-10-formylTHHF was a more effective inhibitor than [6R,S]-5-formylTHHF (Table 2). The Ki for N10-formyl folates decreased with glutamate chain length; [6R]-10-formylTHF inhibited MTHFS with a Ki of 150 nm, whereas [6R,S]-10-formylTHF triglutamate inhibited MTHFS with a Ki of 30 nm. These results demonstrate that both N10-formyl substitution and the glutamate chain increase the affinity of folates for MTHFS. The effective inhibition of MTHFS by [6R]-10-formylTHF polyglutamate, a naturally occurring folate derivative, indicates that 10-formylTHF regulates MTHFS activity in vivo.TABLE 2Inhibition of MTHFS All reactions were carried out at 37 °C in 100 mm MES, pH 6.0 in the presence of 10 μm [6S]-5-formylTHF.InhibitorKiμmFolic acid58 ± 5Folic acid Glu317 ± 3Folic acid Glu51.0 ± 0.310-Formylfolic acid13 ± 6[6R,S]-10-formylTHPteroate5 ± 2[6R]-10-formylTHF0.15 ± 0.09[6R,S]-10-formylTHFGlu30.03 ± 0.01[6R,S]-5-formylTHHF0.7 ± 0.3[6R,S]-10-formylTHHF0.20 ± 0.02 Open table in a new tab Structural Analysis of MTHFS Active Site—The murine MTHFS model shows the calculated solvent-accessible surface colored according to electrostatic potential (Fig. 3, blue for positive and red for negative). The positioning of the substrate, 5-formylTHF (in green), is identical to that observed in the active site of the M. pneumoniae crystal structure of the MTHFS·ADP·Pi·5-formylTHF complex. In this model, the MTHFS N terminus is at the lower left, the entrance to the ATP binding site is on the left side, and the view is directly into the 5-formylTHF binding site. All the inserted loops (i.e. the poorly modeled portions of the structure) are in the top half of the molecule. The positively charged region at the bottom of the structure is the putative polyglutamate binding site. In this model, the conformation of 5-formylTHF exposes the γ-carboxyl of the 5-formylTHF glutamate moiety to the solvent, but this part of the molecule was not well defined in the crystal structure (zero occupancies are given in the Protein Data Bank for all atoms past C9). Adjustment of the 5-formylTHF model using O (35.Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar) reveals that it is easily possible for hydrogen-bonding interactions to be made between polar atoms in the substrate glutamate moiety and the side chains of residues Lys-17 and Arg-147. Glu-62 could also be part of a network of H-bonds involving 5-formylTHF and the protein surface. All three of these residues are conserved in known mammalian MTHFS sequences, and Lys-17 of rabbit liver MTHFS can be cross-linked to the α-carboxylate of 5-formylTHF (36.Maras B. Stover P. Valiante S. Barra D. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18429-18433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The lack of specific contacts for the 5-formylTHF Glu1 is consistent with its apparent weak contribution to substrate specificity (Table 1). Residues lining the 5-formylTHF binding site include amino acid sequence regions 58–64, 97–105, 133–136, and 144–152 (corresponding to 49–55, 76–84, 104–107, and 115–123, respectively, in the M. pneumoniae protein) (Fig. 4a). The pterin moiety of 5-formylTHF is coordinated by the side chain of Glu-64 and the main chain O of Asp-59 and probably by Gln-58 Oϵ1 and Ser-97 Oγ. The first two of these interactions are present in the M. pneumoniae structure and in the MTHFS of most species, whereas the latter two are not. Modeling an ATP into the MTHFS active site such that the γ-phosphate occupies the site of a phosphate in the M. pneumoniae structure illustrates that a simple rotation of the formyl group of 5-formylTHF places the formyl O in good approximation and orientation for nucleophilic attack on the γ-phosphorous (Fig. 4a). The importance of the highly conserved residues 144, 148, and 150–152 in defining the active site is apparent: Arg-144 occupies a critical position coordinating both the N5-formyl group of 5-formylTHF and the γ-phosphate of ATP. 10-FormylTHF can be built into the THF binding site without altering the position of side chain residues (Fig. 4b). Because the active site is not tightly constricted, several folate derivatives can be positioned to form good interactions between the pterin moiety and residues lining the binding site and between the glutamate moiety and surface hydrophilic residues. This is consistent with the kinetic data that demonstrate weak inhibition of MTHFS activity by most folate derivatives (Table 2). However, it is not possible to position the N10 formyl oxygen properly for attack on the γ-phosphorous of ATP. Approach of the formyl oxygen to the phosphorous is hindered by two of the phosphate oxygens. The angle (formyl O)-P-(opposite P-O bond) is nearly linear with the 5-formyl moiety but is bent by ∼40° with the 10-formyl moiety. In the case of N10 formyl species, it is possible that an H-bond could be formed between the formyl O and Lys-149 N; whether this is sufficient to explain the tighter binding of N10-formylated inhibitors is unclear (Table 2). Effect of MTHFS Expression on Purine Biosynthesis—The intracellular concentration of folate derivatives is less than the binding capacity of folate-utilizing enzymes, indicating that biosynthetic pathways within the one-carbon network compete for a limiting pool of folate cofactors (6.Suh J.R. Herbig A.K. Stover P.J. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2001; 21: 255-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 34.Bertrand R. MacKenzie R.E. Jolivet J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 911: 154-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Folate-binding proteins can serve as “sinks” that sequester specific folates and thereby inhibit folate-dependent pathways or can interact with other enzymes to selectively “channel” cofactors and accelerate flux through individual biosynthetic pathways (12.Schirch V. Strong W.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 269: 371-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). 10-FormylTHF is required by GARFT and phosphoribosylaminoimidazole carboxamide formyltransferase, two folate-dependent enzymes involved in de novo purine biosynthesis (Fig. 2) (1.Shane B. Bailey L.B. Folate in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1995: 1-22Google Scholar, 11.Moran R.G. Semin. Oncol. 1999; 26: 24-32PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the metabolic effects of 10-formylTHF sequestration by MTHFS on de novo purine biosynthesis, a “formate suppression” assay was developed. Mammalian cells expressing the MTHFS cDNA were cultured in the presence of [3H]hypoxanthine and [14C]formate. [3H]Hypoxanthine is converted to purine nucleotides via the folate-independent salvage pathway, whereas [14C]formate is incorporated into purine nucleotides via the de novo pathway after condensing with THF to form 10-formylTHF (Fig. 5). The ability of the de novo purine biosynthetic pathway to suppress contributions from the purine salvage pathway to DNA synthesis was investigated in human SHSY-5Y and SHSY-5YMTHFS neuroblastoma cells. SHSY-5YMTHFS cells display 100-fold increased MTHFS activity and protein levels (19.Stover P. Schirch V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 102-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 34.Bertrand R. MacKenzie R.E. Jolivet J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 911: 154-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The ratio of 14C to 3H (dpm) in DNA and purine nucleotides serves as a measure of de novo purine synthesis efficiency. The 14C/3H ratio in nuclear DNA is 20% higher in SHSY-5YMTHFS cells compared with the parent cell line (Fig. 6). Because 14C could also be incorporated into deoxythymidine and methylcytosine (Fig. 2) via equilibration into the folate-activated one-carbon pool, the DNA was digested to nucleosides, which were fractionated by HPLC. The deoxyguanosine and deoxyadenosine 14C/3H ratio was increased by 43 and 69%, respectively, in SHSY-5YMTHFS cells compared with the parent cell line (Fig. 6). Comparison of 14C counts derived from purified deoxythymidine normalized to 3H counts from deoxyadenosine indicates that increased MTHFS expression does not affect the 14C deoxythymidine/3H deoxyadenosine ratio. The enhancement of de novo purine biosynthesis by MTHFS indicates that MTHFS-bound 10-formylTHF is available for de novo purine biosynthesis.FIGURE 6MTHFS enhances de novo purine biosynthesis. Mammalian cells expressing the MTHFS cDNA were cultured in the presence of [3H]hypoxanthine and [14C]formate. [3H]Hypoxanthine is converted to purines via the folate-independent salvage pathway, whereas [14C]formate is incorporated into purines via the de novo pathway. The 14C/3H dpm ratio was determined in SHSY-5Y and SHSY-5YMTHFS nuclear DNA. Nuclear DNA was isolated from SHSY-5Y (white bars) and SHSY-5YMTHFS (shaded bars) and digested to nucleosides, which were then separated by HPLC. The 14C and 3H content (dpm) in resulting fractions was quantified on a Beckman Coulter LS6500 scintillation counter. Variation is expressed as S.D. of the mean from three measurements for separated nucleosides and six experiments for nuclear DNA. dA, deoxyadenosine; dT, deoxythymidine; dG, deoxyguanosine.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The data presented in this study provide the first evidence that 5-formylTHF concentrations are regulated in mammalian cells. The product of the MTHFS reaction, 5, 10-methenylTHF, exists in chemical equilibrium with 10-formylTHF. Upon the hydrolysis of 5,10-methenylTHF to 10-formylTHF, the MTHFS reaction is subject to feedback inhibition by 10-formylTHF (Table 2) (Fig. 7). This discovery that MTHFS is regulated by 10-formylTHF informs the physiological function of 5-formylTHF. 5-FormylTHF can only accumulate when MTHFS is inhibited by 10-formylTHF. Therefore, 10-formylTHF accumulation both suppresses 5-formylTHF metabolism and, through its equilibrium conversion to 5,10-methenylTHF, serves as a substrate for 5-formylTHF synthesis by serine hydroxymethyltransferase. This regulatory mechanism does not support a role for physiological regulation of purine biosynthesis by 5-formylTHF. 5-FormylTHF can only accumulate when the substrate for de novo purine biosynthesis, 10-formylTHF, accumulates. Feedback regulation of MTHFS does indicate that 5-formylTHF represents a stable pool of excess formyl folates that can be mobilized by MTHFS only when 10-formylTHF levels are depleted. These studies have also identified MTHFS as a 10-formylTHF tight-binding protein. Folate cofactors are bound by enzymes that utilize one-carbon units in transfer reactions and also by folate tight-binding proteins that do not metabolize the cofactor but regulate its availability. For example, 5-methylTHF is a substrate for methionine synthase but is bound tightly to and inhibits glycine N-methyltransferase (37.Yeo E.J. Briggs W.T. Wagner C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37559-37564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). THF is bound tightly by and inhibits 10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (38.Fu T.F. Maras B. Barra D. Schirch V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 367: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and 5-formylTHF and 5-methylTHF are bound tightly by and inhibit serine hydroxymethyltransferase (39.Herbig K. Chiang E.P. Lee L.R. Hills J. Shane B. Stover P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38381-38389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). MTHFS is the first 10-formylTHF tight-binding protein to be identified. Previously, we have shown that increased MTHFS expression in SHSY-5Y cells increased relative concentrations of 10-formylTHF at the expense of 5-methylTHF levels; 10-formylTHF levels constituted as much as 90% of total cellular folate in MTHFS-expressing cells (21.Girgis S. Suh J.R. Jolivet J. Stover P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4729-4734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These results are consistent with MTHFS serving as a reservoir for 10-formylTHF that permits its accumulation. The results from this study indicate that MTHFS may determine the fate of cellular 10-formylTHF (Fig. 7). 10-FormylTHF can be used by three pathways. It is a cofactor for phosphoribosylaminoimidazole carboxamide formyltransferase and GARFT during de novo purine biosynthesis. Alternatively, the 10-formyl group can be reduced and the cofactor converted to other THF one-carbon forms through its conversion to 5,10-methenylTHF by the enzyme 5,10-methenylTHF cyclohydrolase. Finally, 10-formylTHF can be converted to THF and CO2 by the enzyme 10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase, an enzyme that depletes the supply of 10-formylTHF (38.Fu T.F. Maras B. Barra D. Schirch V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 367: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In this study, we have demonstrated that sequestration of 10-formylTHF by MTHFS enhances de novo purine biosynthesis, which supports a role for MTHFS in directing 10-formylTHF to de novo purine synthesis. 10-FormylTHF sequestration by MTHFS may function to protect purine biosynthesis from disruptions in the one-carbon network, including folate deficiency. Although there is no direct evidence that MTHFS associates with phosphoribosylaminoimidazole carboxamide formyltransferase or GARFT and channels 10-formylTHF, the electrostatic surface of MTHFS shows a large negatively charged area near the active site that is a potential protein-protein interaction site (Fig. 3). Previous studies have demonstrated that MTHFS and cytoplasmic serine hydroxymethyltransferase exhibit very different tissue expression patterns (40.Anguera M.C. Suh J.R. Ghandour H. Nasrallah I.M. Selhub J. Stover P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29856-29862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), indicating that MTHFS may play other roles in one-carbon metabolism distinct from metabolizing 5-formylTHF, including serving as a 10-formylTHF-binding protein. These results inform the design of inhibitors that target MTHFS. The data in Table 2 indicate that high affinity MTHFS inhibitors should be N10 formyl substituted and be capable of conversion to polyglutamate derivatives in the cell. N5-substituted MTHFS inhibitors, including 5-formylTHHF, are not attractive in vivo inhibitors because they can be phosphorylated and slowly metabolized by some mammalian MTHFS enzymes and because they are not effective substrates for folylpolyglutamate synthetase (1.Shane B. Bailey L.B. Folate in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1995: 1-22Google Scholar). A number of GARFT inhibitors have been synthesized (4.Clark S. Banfield K. Carmel R. Jacobsen D.W.

DDATHF inhibited mouse GARFT with a Ki of 6 nm and human GARFT with a Ki of 60 nm. It also proved to be an effective inhibitor of cell growth with an EC50 of 10–30 nm in several different cell lines (42.McGuire J.J. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2003; 9: 2593-2613Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). A similar compound, 10-formyl-5,10-dideaza-acyclicTHF (10-formyl-DDACTHF), was shown to exhibit some selectivity for GARFT. 10-Formyl-DDACTHF is a substrate for folylpolyglutamate synthetase and accumulates in cell cultures over 100-fold (41.Marsilje T.H. Labroli M.A. Hedrick M.P. Jin Q. Desharnais J. Baker S.J. Gooljarsingh L.T. Ramcharan J. Tavassoli A. Zhang Y. Wilson I.A. Beardsley G.P. Benkovic S.J. Boger D.L. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2002; 10: 2739-2749Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The pentaglutamate form effectively inhibits GARFT (Ki, 14 nm) and was an effective cytotoxic agent (IC50, 60 nm). Given the high affinity of MTHFS for the natural isomer of 10-formylTHFGlu3 (Ki, 15 nm) and its relaxed specificity for the pterin moiety, the results of the present work suggest that N10-substituted analogs of 10-formylTHF may be targeting MTHFS, which may contribute to their cytotoxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2002863315,"Protein translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum occurs at pore-forming structures known as translocons. In yeast, two different targeting pathways converge at a translocation pore formed by the Sec61 complex. The signal recognition particle-dependent pathway targets nascent precursors co-translationally, whereas the Sec62p-dependent pathway targets polypeptides post-translationally. In addition to the Sec61 complex, both pathways also require Sec63p, an integral membrane protein of the Hsp40 family, and Kar2p, a soluble Hsp70 located in the ER lumen. Using a series of mutant alleles, we demonstrate that a conserved Brl (Brr2-like) domain in the COOH-terminal cytosolic region of Sec63p is essential for function both <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i>. We further demonstrate that this domain is required for assembly of two oligomeric complexes of 350 and 380 kDa, respectively. The larger of these corresponds to the heptameric ""SEC complex"" required for post-translational translocation. However, the 350-kDa complex represents a newly defined hexameric SEC′ complex comprising Sec61p, Sss1p, Sbh1p, Sec63p, Sec71p, and Sec72p. Our data indicate that the SEC′ complex is required for co-translational protein translocation across the yeast ER membrane."

Consecutive phosphatidyl inositol kinase-like kinase (PIKK)-dependent and PIKK-independent steps in activation of Rad53 are key steps for controlling and transmitting diverse downstream responses to DNA damage. However, these activities have not been demonstrated in vitro in defined systems.

Ionizing radiation, radiomimetic chemicals, and metabolically reactive species induce a variety of DNA lesions. Cells have evolved a series of mechanisms to cope with such damage and thus avoid loss of genome integrity. DNA damage checkpoint pathways initiate a signal transduction cascade to ensure that cells progress through DNA replication and mitosis with intact genetic information (1.Motoyama N. Naka K. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2004; 14: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). DNA damage checkpoint pathways are remarkably well conserved from yeasts to man (2.Melo J. Toczyski D. Curr. Opin.

Based on biochemical and genetic observations, multiple mechanisms of DNA damage-dependent activation of Rad53 have been proposed (Fig. 1). The PIKKs Mec1 and Tel1 regulate targets through phosphorylation at consensus SQ/TQ sites that are often reiterated in domains known as SCDs (SQ/TQ-rich cluster domains) (12.Schwartz M.F. Duong J.K.

A. 2000; 97: 10389-10394Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). Mec1 and/or Tel1 are required for activation of Rad53 in vivo and are linked with Rad53 activation through PIKK-dependent phosphorylation of consensus PIKK sites within Rad53. Elimination of phosphorylation sites in the SCDs by mutagenesis largely abrogates regulated phosphorylation of Rad53 (25.Lee S.-J. Schwartz M.F. Duong J.K. Stern D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6300-6314Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 29.Sun Z. Fay D.S. Marini F. Foiani M. Stern D.F. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 395-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Kinase-defective forms of Rad53 are still partially phosphorylated in response to DNA damage and replicational stress, so damage-dependent phosphorylation of Rad53 occurs at least in part in trans, through the action of other protein kinases (16.Sanchez Y. Desany B.A. Jones W.J. Liu Q. Wang B. Elledge S.J. Science. 1996; 271: 357-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 20.Pellicioli A. Lucca C. Liberi G. Marini F. Lopes M. Plevani P. Romano A.

Moreover, recent studies have shown that fusion of Ddc2 with Rad53 fusion proteins enables damage-regulated Rad53 phosphorylation and activity in the absence of mediators (30.Lee S.J. Duong J.K. Stern D.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 5443-5455Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). These data support the simple model that Rad53 is activated directly through phosphorylation by PIKKs (Fig. 1, Models A and B). However, there is no published evidence that phosphorylation of Rad53 or Chk2 by the cognate PIKKs in vitro enhances catalytic activity. Moreover, genetic evidence indicated that PIKKs are not sufficient for Rad53 activation in vivo (31.Emili A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 183-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 32.de la Torre-Ruiz M.A. Green C.M. Lowndes N.F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2687-2698Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Rather, mediator proteins Mrc1 and Rad9 are required to couple replicational stress and DNA damage to activation of Rad53 (12.Schwartz M.F. Duong J.K. Sun Z. Morrow J.S. Pradhan D. Stern D.F. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1055-1065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 33.Alcasabas A.A. Osborn A.J. Bachant J. Hu F. Werler P.J. Bousset K. Furuya K. Diffley J.F. Carr A.M.

Earlier studies suggested that Rad9 functions as an adaptor or scaffold protein for signal transmission to Rad53. After DNA damage, phosphorylated Rad9 localizes at double-strand breaks, and phosphorylated Rad9 interacts selectively with the FHA domains of Rad53 (12.Schwartz M.F. Duong J.K. Sun Z. Morrow J.S.

Mutagenesis studies show that phosphorylation of Rad9 at PIKK consensus sites is important for checkpoint activation and interaction with Rad53 (12.Schwartz M.F. Duong J.K. Sun Z. Morrow J.S. Pradhan D. Stern D.F. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1055-1065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Mutation of PIKK consensus sites within Rad9 or the FHA domains of Rad53 impairs checkpoint activation (12.Schwartz M.F. Duong J.K. Sun Z. Morrow J.S. Pradhan D. Stern D.F. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1055-1065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 25.Lee S.-J. Schwartz M.F. Duong J.K. Stern D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6300-6314Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Since there is no evidence for direct interaction of Mec1 with Rad53, this led to the hypothesis that Rad9 may act as an adaptor to deliver Rad53 to PIKKs (Fig. 1, Models A and B). This could occur through formation of a ternary complex (Model A) or through a hit-and-run mechanism (Model B). (We have not detected formation of complexes between Mec1 and Rad53 or between Rad9 and Mec1, but S.p. Crb2 and Rad3 do interact when overexpressed (38.Mochida S. Esashi F. Aono N. Tamai K. O'Connell M.J. Yanagida M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 418-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).) Alternatively, phospho-Rad9 might allosterically activate bound Rad53, either directly or by making it a better substrate for PIKKs and other activating kinases, or concentration of phospho-Rad9 at sites of DNA damage may colocalize bound Rad53 to sites near Mec1-Ddc2. Consistent with this idea, targeting Rad53 to sites of DNA damage by fusion with Ddc2 reduces the requirement for Rad9 (30.Lee S.J. Duong J.K. Stern D.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 5443-5455Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Rad9 apparently undergoes a conformational change and/or a change in quarternary structure after DNA damage (39.Gilbert C.S. Green C.M. Lowndes N.F. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 129-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 40.Gilbert C.S. van den Bosch M. Green C.M. Vialard J.E. Grenon M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Lowndes N.F. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 953-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In addition, phosphorylated Rad9 interacts with itself through a mechanism requiring the carboxyl-terminal BRCT domains after DNA damage (41.Soulier J. Lowndes N.F. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 551-554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Bacterially expressed recombinant Rad53p, but not kinase-defective forms of Rad53, is hyperphosphorylated and highly active, indicating that Rad53 can phosphorylate and activate itself in vivo in bacteria (see Fig. 2) (39.Gilbert C.S. Green C.M. Lowndes N.F. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 129-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). 6J.-L. Ma, S.-J. Lee, J. K. Duong, and D. F. Stern, unpublished data.6J.-L. Ma, S.-J. Lee, J. K. Duong, and D. F. Stern, unpublished data. These and other findings led to a model in which Rad9 oligomers work as scaffolds that bind Rad53 and promote cross-phosphorylation of Rad53. Indeed, Rad9-containing complexes promote phosphorylation of recombinant Rad53, but possible changes in Rad53 activity were not evaluated (Fig. 1, Model C) (39.Gilbert C.S. Green C.M. Lowndes N.F. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 129-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). In addition to PIKK-dependent and Rad9-dependent activation of Rad53, it has been hypothesized that Rad53 can directly activate other Rad53 molecules. The high activity of bacterially expressed Rad53 is produced in the absence of other eukaryotic protein kinases. Studies of Rad53 and Chk2 by our laboratory and other laboratories showed that the phosphorylated SCDs of Rad53 and Chk2 are recognized by the FHA domains from those proteins as well (42.Xu X. Tsvetkov L. Stern D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4419-4432Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 43.Ahn J.Y. Li X. Davis H.L. Canman C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 18: 18Google Scholar, 44.Lee C.H. Chung J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30537-30541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Thus SCD-hyperphosphorylated (active) Rad53 and Chk2 readily bind the FHA domains of hypophosphorylated molecules. This homo-oligomerization of Rad53/Chk2 may promote cross-phosphorylation at sites in the activation loop of the kinase domain, which is apparently the final rate-limiting step in Rad53/Chk2 activation (45.Ahn J. Prives C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48418-48426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In summary, there may be three phases to DNA damage-dependent activation of Rad53 (and Chk2) by PIKKs. Initial activation appears to occur through a priming phase in which PIKK-dependent phosphorylation of Rad53 itself activates Rad53. This priming phase is enabled or facilitated in Mediator/Rad53 complexes, which may themselves serve as scaffolds for subsequent PIKK-independent, Mediator-dependent amplification (Fig. 1, Model D). Finally, Rad53 and Chk2 may continue to amplify the signal in homo-oligomerization and cross-phosphorylation reactions that ultimately lead to activation loop phosphorylation (Fig. 1, Model E). Despite the plethora of models, as just discussed, there is fundamental uncertainty about the relative contributions and mechanisms of PIKK- and mediator-dependent activation of Rad53 and Chk2. A major cause of this uncertainty is the lack of cell-free models for activation of Rad53 by itself or by PIKKs that would enable detailed investigation of these processes. We have shown previously that cell lysates can activate Chk2 in vitro (43.Ahn J.Y. Li X. Davis H.L. Canman C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 18: 18Google Scholar), and others have obtained phosphorylation of Rad53 in partially purified systems (39.Gilbert C.S. Green C.M. Lowndes N.F. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 129-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Although phosphorylation is required for activation of Rad53, there is no published evidence directly showing that phosphorylation of Rad53 can activate Rad53 kinase activity in vitro. Furthermore, activation of Rad53/Chk2 by PIKKs or Rad53/Chk-dependent phosphorylation has not been directly tested. To understand the Rad53 activation machinery, we have purified Rad53 and developed conditions for activation of Rad53 by autophosphorylation and by Mec1-Ddc2 complexes.

Cell. 2001; 8: 129-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). pET28b Rad53-3xFLAG (wild type and kinase-defective K227A,D339A) plasmids were constructed by inserting an EcoRI-NotI fragment containing the appropriate Rad53-3xFLAG open reading frame in pBluescript as described previously (25.Lee S.-J. Schwartz M.F. Duong J.K. Stern D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6300-6314Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). pET28b-Rad53-13xMyc was constructed by replacing a SwaI-NotI fragment of pET28b Rad53-3xFLAG with the corresponding fragment from pRS316 Rad53-13Myc. pRS315 9xMyc-mec1KD (kinase-defective D2224A,N2229A) plasmid was generated by replacing a PacI-SacI fragment of pRS315 18xmyc-MEC1 (described previously (25.Lee S.-J. Schwartz M.F. Duong J.K. Stern D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6300-6314Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar)) with the corresponding fragment from pRS315 V5-mec1KD. In this plasmid, sequences encoding the 9xMyc tag were deleted during subcloning. Mec1 was prepared with immunoprecipitation from yJKD 417 (W303 background; MATa ade2-1 can1-100 his 3-11,15 leu2-3,112 trp1-1 ura3-1 sml1-1 rad53-XB:: HIS3 mec1ρ::TRP) transformed with pRS315 18xMEC1 or pRS315 9xMEC1. Expression and Purification of His-tagged Rad53—Expression of pET-Rad53 (wild type, kinase-defective, Myc-tagged, and FLAG-tagged) in BL21(De3)pLysS cells (Stratagene) was induced by adding 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h. Cells were harvested and lysed by sonication in HEPES lysis buffer A (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol, and 1% Triton X-100) with a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics). Lysates were clarified for 15 min at 12,000 × g, and the supernatant was rotated 4–8 h at 4 °C with Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (Qiagen). The beads were washed three times with HEPES washing buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol, and 1% Triton X-100) and eluted with imidazole elution buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol, and 1% Triton X-100). To produce dephosphorylated Rad53, the hyperphosphorylated form of Rad53 purified from bacteria was incubated with bacteriophage λ phosphatase (New England Biolabs) in the manufacturer's recommended buffer for 2 h at 30° C and repurified with Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads using the procedure described above. The concentration of recombinant Rad53 was determined by comparing the intensity of Coomassie Blue staining with that of protein standards. Antibodies—We used affinity-purified polyclonal goat anti-Rad53 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or rabbit anti-Rad53 produced in our laboratory as described previously (14.Zheng P. Fay D.S. Burton J. Xiao H. Pinkham J.L. Stern D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5829-5842Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated forms of Rad53 and Ddc2 were detected using rabbit polyclonal antibodies that recognize phosphorylated (S/T)Q motifs (Cell Signaling Technology). Myc-, HA-, and FLAG-tagged proteins were detected by incubation for 1–2 h with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated antibodies (anti-Myc-HRP and anti-HA-HRP from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and anti-FLAG-HRP from Sigma). Immunoprecipitations (IP)—Cells were incubated with 0.1% methyl methane sulfonate for 1 h and then washed with HEPES lysis buffer B (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100) flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C. The thawed cells (20 g) were resuspended in 30 ml of HEPES lysis buffer C (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1% aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm NaF, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm sodium orthovanadate, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) and disrupted in a French press. The crude extract was clarified by ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g for 90 min). 15–20 μg of protein were used per IP with 10 μg of mouse anti-Myc antibody (Sigma), 2 μg of rat anti-HA antibody (Roche Applied Science) or mouse IgG, and 30 μl of protein G-plus protein A-agarose beads (Oncogene Science). IP mixtures were rotated for 3–4 h, centrifuged, and washed three times in HEPES lysis buffer B and twice in Mec1 Kinase buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MnCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mixture). Pull-down Reactions—100 ng of each purified protein was used. Rad53 preparations were mixed and incubated in buffer containing 150 mm NaCl for 30 min at 4 °C and then incubated with agarose beads containing either anti-Myc antibodies or anti-FLAG antibodies for 30 min at 4 °C. The beads were collected by centrifugation, washed three times in buffer containing 200 mm NaCl, and then eluted with SDS sample buffer. Kinase Assays—(i) In situ Rad53 autophosphorylation assays were performed as described previously (20.Pellicioli A. Lucca C. Liberi G. Marini F. Lopes M. Plevani P. Romano A. Paolo Di Fiore P. Foiani M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6561-6572Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 25.Lee S.-J. Schwartz M.F. Duong J.K. Stern D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6300-6314Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). (ii) For Mec1 kinase assays, Mec1 was immunoprecipitated as described above. Kinase reactions with recombinant Rad53 as substrate were performed in Mec1 kinase buffer containing 10 μm nonradioactive ATP for 25 min at 30 °C in a volume of 60 μl. After this first kinase reaction, 15 μl of kinase buffer was added to the reaction mixture. For controls in which the first incubation had been carried out in the absence of ATP, this buffer also contained 10 μm nonradioactive ATP. SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added to 25-μl portions of the first reaction mixture containing the Mec1 immunoprecipitates or control IgG agarose beads for analysis of products of the first reaction. Samples were resolved in 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. 50 μl remaining from the total mixtures was then processed for the second kinase reactions to measure Rad53 activity. (iii) in trans Rad53 kinase assays were carried out in 75 μl of total reaction volume in Rad53 kinase buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 10 mm MnCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mixture) with 3 μg of histone H1 (Roche Applied Science) as substrate and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Kinase reactions were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C and stopped by adding SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples were resolved in gradient SDS-4–15% polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad) and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). Radiolabeled proteins were visualized with autoradiography and quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were then immunoblotted for Rad53 to monitor protein loading. Western Blot Analysis—After 1 h of blocking with 5% milk in TBST (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20), membranes were incubated with anti-Rad53 and anti-phospho-(S/T)Q antibodies overnight and secondary antibodies for 1 h. Proteins were detected using ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Correlation of Extent of Autophosphorylation with Kinase Activity of Recombinant Rad53—To establish an in vitro system to assay activation of Rad53p, histidine-tagged full-length recombinant Rad53p was purified from Escherichia coli. As shown in previous studies, recombinant Rad53p expressed in E. coli is hyperphosphorylated (Fig. 2A, Time 0) (39.Gilbert C.S. Green C.M. Lowndes N.F. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 129-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Hyperphosphorylated forms are not produced when kinase-defective alleles of Rad53 are expressed, indicating that the phosphorylation is not mediated by bacterial enzymes (39.Gilbert C.S. Green C.M. Lowndes N.F. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 129-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar).6 PIKK substrates are phosphorylated at (S/T)Q consensus sites preferred by PIKKs. However, as we and others have shown, such sites can also be substrates for other protein kinases, including Rad53 and Chk2. The hyperphosphorylated form of Rad53p produced by bacterial expression reacts strongly with anti-phospho-(S/T)Q antibodies, marking Rad53-dependent phosphorylation at one or more (S/T)Q sites. (Fig. 2A, Time 0). Incubation of hyperphosphorylated Rad53p with λ phosphatase causes a progressive increase in the electrophoretic mobility of Rad53 and a loss of immunoreactive phospho-(S/T)Q (Fig. 2A). To develop assays for Rad53 regulation, we analyzed the activity of Rad53 protein kinase using histone H1 as substrate. Hyperphosphorylated Rad53 produced in bacteria is active in trans-kinase assays using histone H1 as substrate (Fig. 2A, lowest panel). Rad53 has autophosphorylation activity in these assays, measured in immune complexes (Fig. 2A) or using in situ filter assays in which Rad53 transferred to filters after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis is renatured and incubated in situ with [γ-32P]ATP (Fig. 2B). As shown before, the activity of recombinant Rad53 in all three kinase assay formats was nearly eliminated by enzymatic dephosphorylation of Rad53 with λ phosphatase (Fig. 2). Dephosphorylation was monitored by immunoblotting with anti-(S/T)Q and by Rad53 immunoblotting for mobility shifts. For kinase assays with the exogenous substrate H1, the decrease in activity occurred monotonically in parallel with dephosphorylation. In contrast, Rad53 autophosphorylation was maximal for partially dephosphorylated forms in immune complex and in situ autophosphorylation kinase assays. The weaker apparent autophosphorylation activity of bacterially expressed Rad53 was probably due to prior occupancy of Rad53 autophosphorylation sites with nonradioactive phosphate, but negative regulation by phosphorylation cannot be ruled out. Regardless of the assay, continued dephosphorylation of Rad53 nearly eliminated its catalytic activity. In Vitro Activation of Rad53 by Autophosphorylation—As discussed in the Introduction, it is thought that Rad53- or Chk2-dependent autoactivation can replace priming by PIKK-dependent activation for signal amplification. This autoactivation requires phosphorylation. Thus we determined whether Rad53-dependent Rad53 phosphorylation is sufficient to activate Rad53 in vitro. Recombinant Rad53 was produced in bacteria and enzymatically dephosphorylated as shown in Fig. 2. The recombinant R"

We confirmed the presence of a single 14-3-3 homolog gene (g14-3-3) by an in silico screening of the complete genome of Giardia, and we demonstrated its constitutive transcription throughout the life stages of the parasite. We cloned and expressed the g14-3-3 in bacteria, and by protein-protein interaction assays we demonstrated that it is a functional 14-3-3. Using an anti-peptide antibody raised against a unique 18-amino acid sequence at the N terminus, we observed variations both in the intracellular localization and in the molecular size of the native g14-3-3 during the conversion of Giardia from trophozoites to the cyst stage. An affinity chromatography, based on the 14-3-3 binding to the polypeptide difopein, was set to purify the native g14-3-3. By matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectroscopy analysis, we showed that polyglycylation, an unusual post-translational modification described only for tubulin, occurred at the extreme C terminus of the native g14-3-3 on Glu246, Glu247, or both and that the Thr214, located in the loop between helices 8 and 9, is phosphorylated. We propose that the addition of the polyglycine chain can promote the binding of g14-3-3 to alternative ligands and that the differential rate of polyglycylation/deglycylation during the encystation process can act as a novel mechanism to regulate the intracellular localization of g14-3-3.

With the exception of prokaryotes, they have been found in all eukaryotes studied to date, including protozoa, yeasts, plants, and animals (1Rosenquist M. Sehnke P. Ferl R.J. Sommarin M. Larsson C. J. Mol. Evol. 2000; 51: 446-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Generally, unicellular organisms have either one or two 14-3-3s (e.g. the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum has one, and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has two), whereas multicellular organisms contain several. Mammals, including Homo sapiens, contain seven 14-3-3 genes (i.e. β, γ, ∈, σ, ζ, τ, η), and 15 genes coding for 14-3-3s have been identified in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana. 14-3-3 homologs have also been found in several protozoan and metazoan parasites (1Rosenquist M. Sehnke P. Ferl R.J. Sommarin M. Larsson C. J. Mol. Evol. 2000; 51: 446-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 2Siles Lucas del Mar M. Gottstein B. Trends Parasitol. 2003; 19: 575-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of both animal and plant 14-3-3s has been shown to be conserved. The monomers, consisting of nine α-helices organized in a cup-like shape, are able to interact by their N-terminal portions to form U-shaped dimers (3Liu D. Bienkowska J. Petosa C. Collier R.J. Fu H.

The phosphorylation (or dephosphorylation) of the 14-3-3 ligands determines their intracellular localization, complex formation, enzyme activation, and conformational changes through the association or dissociation with 14-3-3s.With regard to protozoan parasites, only limited information is available on 14-3-3s. Preliminary studies, which have mainly focused on expression and localization, have been conducted on Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium knowlesi, Toxoplasma gondii, and Eimeria tenella, and the results have suggested that 14-3-3s play a role in the transmission of the regulatory signals involved in a wide array of biological processes, including the proliferation and migration of the parasite during infection (2Siles Lucas del Mar M.

The flagellate protozoan G. duodenalis (syn. lamblia or intestinalis), which parasitizes the upper part of the small intestine of mammals, including humans, is one of the major causes of non-bacterial diarrhea worldwide (14Thompson R.C. Int. J. Parasitol. 2000; 12-13: 1259-1267Crossref Scopus (356) Google Scholar). This parasite belongs to the order Diplomonadidae, the earliest known branching eukaryotic lineage. Giardia is an “ancient” eukaryote, as inferred from the phylogenetic analysis of different genes and proteins (15Sogin M.L. Gunderson J.H. Elwood H.J. Alonso R.A. Peattie D.A. Science. 1989; 243: 75-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar, 16Hedges S.B. Blair J.E. Venturi M.L. Shoe J.L. BMC Evol. Biol. 2004; 4: 2Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar) and from the finding that it retains many prokaryotic characteristics, such as the size of the small subunit rRNA and the presence of bacterial-like metabolic enzymes. Moreover, it lacks typical eukaryotic structures (i.e. peroxisomes) and has a reduced Golgi apparatus and mitochondrial remnant organelles (known as “mitosomes”), probably as an adaptation to parasitism (17Lloyd D. Harris J.C. Trends Microbiol. 2002; 10: 122-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The Giardia life cycle consists of two main stages, (i) the trophozoite, a teardrop-shaped binucleated cell that colonizes the host intestine and reproduces through binary fission, and (ii) the cyst, an infective stage that is able to survive in the external environment. Given that the life cycle can be reproduced in vitro and that the entire genome is available (18McArthur A.G. Morrison H.G. Nixon J.E. Passamaneck N.Q. Kim U. Hinkle G. Crocker M.K. Holder M.E. Farr R. Reich C.I. Olsen G.E. Aley S.B. Adam R.D. Gillin F.D. Sogin M.L. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2000; 189: 271-273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Giardia is a suitable model for analyzing the functions of 14-3-3s in eukaryotes and the peculiar role of this class of protein in parasites.In the present study we describe the cloning and expression of the 14-3-3 protein homolog of G. duodenalis. The recombinant 14-3-3 was biochemically characterized, and the expression and intracellular localization of the 14-3-3 protein were studied during the parasite life stages using specific antibodies. Moreover, mass spectroscopy analysis of the purified protein demonstrated that the Giardia 14-3-3 is phosphorylated and, for the first time, that it is a target for polyglycylation.MATERIALS AND METHODSChemicals—[γ-32P]ATP and [α-32P]dCTP (specific activities, 110 TBq/mmol) were from MP Biomedicals (Irvine, CA); PreScission protease was from Amersham Biosciences. The catalytic subunit of protein kinase A, dithiothreitol and iodoacetamide were from Sigma. The soluble Raf259p phosphopeptide, LSQRQRST(pS)TPNVHMV (pS, phosphoserine) was synthesized, and the anti-g14-3-3 polyclonal antibody was produced by NeoMPS (Strasbourg, France). Chemicals for gel electrophoresis were from Bio-Rad. All other reagents were of analytical grade.Cell Culture and Differentiation—Trophozoites of the G. duodenalis WB-C6 strain were axenically grown for 72 h at 37 °C in TYI-S-33 medium supplemented with 10% bovine serum and bovine bile at pH 7.0. Encystation was induced essentially as described (19Kane A.V. Ward H.D. Keusch G.T. Pereira M.E. J. Parasitol. 1991; 77: 974-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were grown until confluence, and the medium was replaced with TYI-S-33 supplemented with 10% bovine serum and 10 mg/ml bovine bile at pH 7.8 and then incubated at 37 °C for the indicated time as shown in the figures.Nucleic Acid Isolation—Genomic DNA was isolated from 109 cells of G. duodenalis using the phenol/chloroform extraction method. Total RNA was extracted from 107 trophozoites, or encysting parasites, using the RNAeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Plasmid DNA was isolated from bacteria using the QIAPrep kit (Qiagen).PCR Amplification—The sequence encoding for the g14-3-3 protein without any intron was amplified directly from the genomic DNA of the WB-C6 isolate using the primers Gd14forw (5′-ggatccatggccgaggcatttacgcgt-3′) and Gd14rev (5′-gaatcctcatcacttctcctcggcattatcgtc-3′), designed to anneal with, respectively, the ATG and the stop codons of the coding sequence (the BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites are underlined). PCR reactions were performed in a final volume of 50 μl using 5 μl of 10 × buffer containing 20 mm MgCl2 (Takara Holdings Inc., Kyoto, Japan), 50 μm dNTPs (Takara), 20 pmol of each primer, and 1.25 units of ExTaq (Takara). Reactions were performed on a GeneAmp 2400 thermocycler (Applera Corp., Norwalk, CT). Amplification conditions were 1 cycle at 94 °C for 5 min, 35 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 65 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min, and 1 cycle at 72 °C for 7 min. For the Northern blot analysis, a 725-bp fragment of the G. duodenalis cyst wall protein 1 gene (cwp1) and a 1011-bp fragment of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene (gap1) were amplified using, respectively, the designed primers CWP1forw (5′-ATGATGCTCGCTCTCCTTGC-3′) and CWP1rev (5′-TCAAGGCGGGGTGAGGC-3′) and primers GAP1forw (5′-ATGCCTATTCGCCTCGG-3′) and GAP1rev (5′-TTAGCAGCCCTTGGACC-3′). The PCR conditions were the same as those used to amplify the g14-3-3 fragment.Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA (10 μg) was separated on 1.2% agarose gel containing 37% formaldehyde. RNA was capillary-transferred with 20× standard saline phosphate-EDTA onto Hybond-N nylon membranes (Amersham Biosciences), and Northern hybridization was performed at 50 °C, as described by Sambrook et al. (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.39-7.52Google Scholar), using specific probes previously labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the RadPrime DNA labeling system kit (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s instructions.Vector Construction—The g14-3-3 coding sequence was amplified by PCR as described above. For overlay experiments, a short sequence, coding for a protein kinase A phosphorylation site, was introduced by PCR at the 5′ end of the g14-3-3 coding sequence using the designed primers Gd14PKforw (5′-ggatcccgtcgtgcatctgttatggccgaggcatttacgcgt-3′) (the BamHI site is underlined, and the phosphorylation site coding sequence is in italics) and Gd14rev to produce the modified gPK14-3-3 protein. The PCR conditions were the same as those described for g14-3-3 amplification. Both fragments were cloned in the BamHI and EcoRI sites of the pGEX6-P1 vector (Amersham Biosciences) in-frame with the glutathione S-transferase (GST) 3The abbreviations used are: used: GST, glutathione S-transferase; LC, liquid chromatography; ESI, electrospray; MS, mass spectrometry; MS/MS, tandem MS; MS3, triple stage MS; α-cyano, α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Ab, antibody; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization; DHB, dihydroxybenzoic acid. and introduced in Escherichia coli JM109 competent cells. The cloned fragments were verified by DNA sequencing. The plasmids were named p14-X and pPK14-X, and the expressed proteins were named g14-3-3 and gPK14-3-3, respectively.The mutants PK-K53E and T214A were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis of the g14-3-3 coding sequence using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis methods (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The plasmid pPK14-X was used as template to produce the PK-K53E mutant, and the plasmid p14-X was used as a template for the T214A mutant. The primers used for mutagenesis were: K53Eforw (5′-ctgctttctgtagcctacgagaacgtcatcggc-3′) and K53Erev (5′-gcgggggccgatgacgttctcgtaggctacaga-3′) and T214Aforw (5′-acagatctggacaagctggccgaggagtcttac-3′) and T214Arev (5′-cgagtccttgtaagactcctcggccagcttgtc-3′) (the mutated triplets are underlined). After 18 cycles of PCR (95 °C for 30 s, 53 °C for 1 min, and 68 °C for 8 min), 10 units of DpnI were added to the mixture to digest the templates, and the reactions were carried out at 37 °C for 2 h. Twenty μl of each reaction mixture was used to transform E. coli JM109 competent cells. The presence of the mutations was determined by DNA sequencing.The plasmid pSCM138A, containing the difopein coding sequence fused to the enhanced green fluorescent protein (21Masters S.C. Fu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45193-45200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), was kindly provided by Dr. Haian Fu. A 169-bp EcoRI difopein fragment was excised from the plasmid and cloned into the EcoRI-digested and dephosphorylated pGEX-6P1 vector in-frame with the GST coding sequence to produce the plasmid pDIF-X.Expression and Purification of the Recombinant Proteins—E. coli- transformed cells were grown in SOB medium (2% bacto tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 0.05% NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, pH 7.2) at A600 = 0.6, and the expression of recombinant proteins was induced in the presence of 1 mm isopropyl thio-β-d-galactoside at 37 °C for 4 h. GST-fused proteins were purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with 10 mm reduced glutathione, pH 8.0, or released from GST by digestion with the appropriate amount of PreScission protease (Amersham Biosciences) in digestion buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 15 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5) at 4 °C for 16 h following the manufacturer’s instructions.Protein Preparation—Total proteins from soluble and membrane fractions were prepared according to the method of Moss et al. (22Moss D.M. Mathews H.M. Visvesvara G.S. Dickerson J.W. Walker E.M. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1990; 28: 254-257Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Briefly, 2 × 109 trophozoites or encysting trophozoites were collected by chilling on ice and washed 3 times with cold PBS (140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.2), and the cell pellet was frozen at -70 °C overnight. Cells were resuspended in 2 volumes of extraction buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl,1mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4), supplemented with a protease-inhibitor mixture (P8340, Sigma) and a phosphatase-inhibitor mixture (P2850, Sigma), and then destroyed by sonication (5 times for 30 s at 60% power and 10% duty cycle) with a Sonoplus ultrasonic homogenizer (Bandelin electronic, Berlin, Germany). The lysate was centrifuged at 24,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected and designated as soluble cytosolic fraction. The sediment containing the membranous material was washed twice with cold PBS and centrifuged both times for 30 min at 24,000 × g at 4 °C. The pellet was then resuspended in 3 ml of 8 m urea, 0.05 m Tris-HCl, 0.3 m KCl, and 0.002 m EDTA, pH 8.0, and constantly stirred at 4 °C overnight. Further solubilization was achieved by sonication (5 times for 30 s at 50% power and 20% duty cycle), and centrifugation was performed at 24,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected, and the urea was removed by diafiltration against TBE (40 mm Tris, 54 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.3) using a PM-5 membrane and then concentrated using Centricon 10 (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The protein concentration was measured with the method of Bradford (52Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213462) Google Scholar) (Bio-Rad), and the material was stored at -70 °C.Western Blot Analysis—Proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 277: 680-685Crossref Scopus (206048) Google Scholar) and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes with 39 mm glycine, 48 mm Tris, 0.1% SDS, and 10% methanol membrane using a semidry apparatus (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked with 5% non-fatty dried milk in T-TBS (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) for 1 h and then incubated with the primary antibody (Ab) in 3% non-fatty dried milk/T-TBS. After incubation with an appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary Ab (1:2000-1:4000), the antibody/antigen interaction was revealed with the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). The anti-g14-3-3 polyclonal Ab was produced in rabbit against the g14-3-3 N-terminal peptide (EAFTREDYVFMAQLNENA), and the serum (N14) was used at a 1:4000 dilution, whereas the AXO49 mouse monoclonal Ab, kindly provided by Dr. M.H. Brè, was used at a 1:2000 dilution.Overlay Assay—The overlay assay was carried out according to Lalle et al. (24Lalle M. Visconti S. Marra M. Camoni L. Velasco R. Aducci P. Plant Mol. Biol. 2005; 59: 713-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). GST-gPK14-3-3 and the GST-PK-K53E mutant were labeled with [32γ P]ATP on a cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation site using the protein kinase A catalytic subunit and then released from GST by cleavage with the PreScission protease. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane with 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, and 0.01% SDS, pH 8.3, and blocked for 1 h with 5% nonfat dried milk in HT buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH pH 7.6, 75 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2,1mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.04% Tween 20). The membrane was incubated at 4 °C overnight in HT buffer with 3% nonfat dried milk and with 1 μg/ml 32P-labeled gPK14-3-3 or PK-K53E (9 kBq/ml). Where indicated, 100 μm concentrations of the soluble phosphopeptide Raf259p (LSQRQRST(pS)TPNVHMV), reproducing one of the 14-3-3 binding motifs of the human Raf-1 protein, was added during the incubation with 32P-gPK14-3-3. After thorough washing with HT buffer, the interaction was revealed by autoradiography. For Pep-spot binding assay, kindly provided by Drs. G. Cesareni and S. Panni, 100 nmol/cm2 of phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of the Raf259 and Raf621 peptides were directly synthesized on cellulose-(3-amino-2-hydroxy-propyl) ether membranes, and after prewashing the filter with 100% ethanol and HT buffer, the overlay assay was performed as described above.Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Trophozoites or encysting cells were collected and fixed at 37 °C with 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 30 min. Fixed cells were stored in PBS at 4 °C until permeabilization, or they were immediately permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS at room temperature for 5 min and then spotted on slides. Slides were blocked with 1% gelatin in PBS for 30 min and then incubated at room temperature with polyclonal anti-g14-3-3 antiserum (1:100) for 1 h. After extensive washes with PBS, the parasites were incubated with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary Ab (Kirkegard and Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) and the Texas Red-conjugated anti-CWP monoclonal Ab A300-TR at 1:30 dilution (Waterborne Inc., New Orleans, LA), and the nuclei were stained with 300 nm 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. After washes with PBS, the slides were mounted with an anti-fading agent (Vectashield, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), and microscopy was performed using a Leica (Bensheim, Germany) confocal laser-scanning microscope with appropriate filter sets. A series of 20 optical sections with an approximate z distance of 0.3 μm was performed for each cell. The image processing was performed using the Huygen program (Scientific Volume Imaging BV, Hilversum, The Netherlands) and the Imaris program (Bitplane, Zurich, Switzerland).Pull-down Assay—For pull-down assays, 15 μg of glutathione-Sepharose immobilized GST or GST-difopein were incubated with 3 mg of Giardia cytosolic fractions from trophozoites or from trophozoites grown for 12 h in encystation medium (12 h encysting cells) in HT buffer at 4 °C for 2 h. After extensive washes with HT buffer, the 14-3-3 proteins bound to the beads were eluted with 100 μl of 5 mm soluble Raf259p phosphopeptide in HT buffer. An aliquot was run in SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblot with the N14 serum as described above.Mass Spectrometry Analysis—Aliquots of the PreScission-cleaved recombinant g14-3-3, the T214A mutant or the purified native g14-3-3 were separated on a one-dimensional gel NuPAGE 4-12% (Novex, Invitrogen) run in MOPS buffer and stained with the Colloidal Blue staining kit (Invitrogen). Slices were excised, treated essentially as previously described (25Shevchenko S. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7771) Google Scholar), and digested with modified trypsin, sequencing grade (Promega Corp.). Peptide mixtures were desalted on a POROS-R2 (Applied Biosystems) handmade microcolumn or directly analyzed by MALDI-time of flight on a Voyager-DE STR mass spectrometer (Applera Corp.) in linear and/or reflector positive mode. As a matrix, we used re-crystallized α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (α-cyano, Sigma) dissolved in 50% CH3CN, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (10 mg/ml) or 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB) (Sigma) in 50% CH3CN, and 1% orthophosphoric acid (30 mg/ml), which has been reported to enhance the efficiency of phosphopeptide ionization in MALDI by diminishing the loss of phosphoric acid (26Kjellstrom S. Jensen O. Anal. Chem. 2004; 76: 5109-5117Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The presence of phosphopeptides in MALDI-MS spectra was confirmed by direct comparison between spectra acquired using 1% orthophosphoric DHB and α-cyano; the metastable decomposition product of the phosphopeptide is prominent with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, whereas it is present in lower quantities or not detectable in a 1% orthophosphoric DHB spectrum. Samples were loaded onto the instrument target using the dried droplet technique. Spectra were externally calibrated using a standard peptide mixture.For the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis, LC/ESI-MS/MS and the LC/ESI-MS3 experiments were performed on an LCQ-DECA XP instrument equipped with a Surveyor MS pump (Thermo Electron Corp.). Peptide mixtures were analyzed on a capillary column, BioBasic C18, 100 × 0.180 mm, 5-μm particle size (Thermo Electron Corp.); the operating flow (2 μl/min) was obtained by the Surveyor MS pump through a homemade splitting device. The LCQ-ESI probe was equipped with a 34-gauge inner diameter metal needle (Thermo Electron Corp.). Peptides were eluted from the column in 50 min using a linear 5-60% acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% formic acid. The acquisition method for LC/ESI-MS/MS experiments was set to perform MS/MS data-dependent scanning on the three most abundant ions, enabling the dynamic exclusion function (repeat count 2). For LC-MS3 experiments, parent ions at m/z 1054.6 (for MS/MS) and 1006.4 (for MS3) were isolated (3.0 m/z window) and fragmented using 35% collision energy.In Vitro Kinase Assays—Approximately 20 μg of the glutathione-Sepharose immobilized recombinant GST-g14-3-3 or GST-T214A mutant protein was mixed with 50 μl of the reaction buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl2, 200 μm ATP, 2.5 μCi of [32γ-P]-ATP, protease and phosphatase inhibitors, and 0.4 mg of the trophozoite cytosolic fraction. After incubation at 30 °C for 1 h, the reactions were stopped by adding 5 mm EDTA, and the beads were extensively washed with T-TBS. The recombinant wild type g14-3-3 and the T214A mutant protein were recovered by digestion with the PreScission protease, as described above, and 2 μg of each protein was run in 12% SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie, and the phosphorylated polypeptides were detected by autoradiography of dried gels.Densitometric Analysis—The image was acquired using the GS-690 Imaging Densitometer (Bio-Rad) and analyzed with the Multi-Analyst 1.1 software (Bio-Rad).Sequence Analysis—General homology searches with DNA and protein sequences were conducted on non-redundant GenBank™ databases using the BLAST algorithm, available at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST. Giardia genome databases were analyzed on-line (www.mbl.edu/Giardia) by submitting the protein sequence on translated databases (TBLASTN). Sequence data were provided by the National Centre for Biotechnology Information. Multiple alignments were performed using the ClustalW program at www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw.RESULTSIdentification and Cloning of the 14-3-3 Coding Sequence from G. duodenalis—A single putative 14-3-3 homolog gene has been annotated in the genome of the G. duodenalis WB-C6 clone (www.mbl.edu/Giardia). To verify the presence of other 14-3-3 homologs, we carried out an in silico screening of the G. duodenalis genome using the BLAST algorithm. As probes, we selected two amino acid sequences, RNLLS-VAYKN(V/I) and SYKDSTLIMQLL(R/H)DNLTLWTD(S/A), previously defined as 14-3-3 signatory motifs (27Wang W. Shakes D.C. J. Mol. Evol. 1996; 43: 384-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The search confirmed the presence of the single open reading frame of 744 bp (GenBank™/EBI accession number AACB01000009), previously identified by the Giardia genome project (18McArthur A.G. Morrison H.G. Nixon J.E. Passamaneck N.Q. Kim U. Hinkle G. Crocker M.K. Holder M.E. Farr R. Reich C.I. Olsen G.E. Aley S.B. Adam R.D. Gillin F.D. Sogin M.L. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2000; 189: 271-273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The gene lacks introns and codes for a polypeptide of 248 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 28.5 kDa and a theoretical isoelectric point of 5.1 (data not shown). The sequence was confirmed by PCR amplification and sequencing of a 2.5-kilobase region spanning the ATG and the stop codon of the open reading frame (data not shown). This gene was named g14-3-3 (GenBank™/EBI accession number DQ146480).Using the ClustalW program, we performed a multiple alignment between the g14-3-3 protein and 117 sequences of different 14-3-3 isoforms from protozoa, fungi, plants, and animals, obtained from the GenBank™ d"
https://openalex.org/W2079135649,"Thiamine pyrophosphokinase transfers a pyrophosphate group from a nucleoside triphosphate, such as ATP, to the hydroxyl group of thiamine to produce thiamine pyrophosphate. Deficiencies in thiamine can result in the development of the neurological disorder Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome as well as the potentially fatal cardiovascular disease wet beriberi. Pyrithiamine is an inhibitor of thiamine metabolism that induces neurological symptoms similar to that of Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome in animals. However, the mechanism by which pyrithiamine interferes with cellular thiamine phosphoester homeostasis is not entirely clear. We used kinetic assays coupled with mass spectrometry of the reaction products and x-ray crystallography of an equilibrium reaction mixture of thiamine pyrophosphokinase, pyrithiamine, and Mg2+/ATP to elucidate the mechanism by which pyrithiamine inhibits the enzymatic production of thiamine pyrophosphate. Three lines of evidence support the ability of thiamine pyrophosphokinase to form pyrithiamine pyrophosphate. First, a coupled enzyme assay clearly demonstrated the ability of thiamine pyrophosphokinase to produce AMP when pyrithiamine was used as substrate. Second, an analysis of the reaction mixture by mass spectrometry directly identified pyrithiamine pyrophosphate in the reaction mixture. Last, the structure of thiamine pyrophosphokinase crystallized from an equilibrium substrate/product mixture shows clear electron density for pyrithiamine pyrophosphate bound in the enzyme active site. This structure also provides the first clear picture of the binding pocket for the nucleoside triphosphate and permits the first detailed understanding of the catalytic requirements for catalysis in this enzyme.

Thiamine pyrophosphokinase (TPK, 2The abbreviations used are: TPK, thiamine pyrophosphokinase; TPP, thiamine pyrophosphate; TMP, thiamine monophosphate; TTP, thiamine triphosphate; PPP, pyrithiamine pyrophosphate; OPP, oxythiamine pyrophosphate; PDB, Protein Data Bank; RMSD, root mean squared deviation; HPPK, 6-hydroxy-methyl-7,8-dihydropterin pyrophosphokinase.2The abbreviations used are: TPK, thiamine pyrophosphokinase; TPP, thiamine pyrophosphate; TMP, thiamine monophosphate; TTP, thiamine triphosphate; PPP, pyrithiamine pyrophosphate; OPP, oxythiamine pyrophosphate; PDB, Protein Data Bank; RMSD, root mean squared deviation; HPPK, 6-hydroxy-methyl-7,8-dihydropterin pyrophosphokinase. EC 2.7.6.2) catalyzes the transfer of a pyrophosphate group from ATP to thiamine to form thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP). TPK is a member of the pyrophosphotransferase family that also includes 6-hydroxy-methyl-7,8-dihydropterin pyrophosphokinase (HPPK), phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthase, nucleotide pyrophosphokinase, and GTP pyrophosphokinase. The product of the reaction, TPP, plays a central role in cellular energy generation and functions as a tightly bound cofactor for the reactions catalyzed by pyruvate dehydrogenase, α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, branched chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase, and 2-hydroxyphytanoyl-CoA lyase. In addition, TPP is also required for transketolase activity in the pentose phosphate pathway. This pathway is the sole source of ribose for nucleotide synthesis and the major source of NADPH for reductive biosynthesis. Therefore, the production of TPP catalyzed by TPK is critical for both catabolic and anabolic cellular processes. TPK is essential for growth and survival in yeast (1Nosaka K. Kaneko Y. Nishimura H. Iwashima A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17440-17447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In humans, thiamine deficiency is most commonly associated with alcoholism and Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome. The latter of which is characterized by depression, cognitive impairment, anorexia as well as ocular abnormalities (2Homewood J. Bond N.W. Alcohol. 1999; 19: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). For example, it has been reported that 86% of alcoholics with Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome are thiamine-deficient (3D'Amour M.L. Brissette S. Lavoie J. Butterworth R.F. Addiction Biol. 2000; 5: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Thiamine administration is necessary to disrupt alcohol addiction of patients and to correct neuronal abnormalities. However, whether the presence of alcohol or the depletion of thiamine contributes to the neuropsychiatric abnormalities is less clear. In addition to functioning as cofactors of some important metabolic enzymes, TPP is also the precursor for two other thiamine phosphoesters, thiamine monophosphate (TMP), and thiamine triphosphate (TTP) (4Bettendorff L. Peeters M. Wins P. Schoffeniels E. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 423-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 5Nosaka K. Kaneko Y. Nishimura H. Iwashima A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1989; 51: 55-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 6Shikata H. Egi Y. Koyama S. Yamada K. Kawasaki T. Biochem. Int. 1989; 18: 943-949PubMed Google Scholar). The functions of TMP and TTP are less clear. TTP is found at low levels, but is present in bacteria, fungi, plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates. Lakaye et al. (7Lakaye B. Wirtzfeld B. Wins P. Grisar T. Bettendorff L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17142-17147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) showed that thiamine triphosphate is required for optimal growth in Escherichia coli during amineo acid starvation and suggested that accumulation of TTP may be involved in a new signal pathway that helps the bacteria to adapt to stringent conditions. In humans, TTP has been found in peripheral nerve cells and has been proposed to be required for ion translocation in stimulated nerve cells. Nghiem et al. (8Nghiem H.O. Bettendorff L. Changeux J.P. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 543-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) showed that TTP is the phosphate donor for the phosphorylation of 43K rapsyn, which is a peripheral protein specifically associated with the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR). The level of TTP seems to be highly regulated (9Lakaye B. Makarchikov A.F. Antunes A.F. Zorzi W. Coumans B. De Pauw E. Wins P. Grisar T. Bettendorff L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13771-13777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 10Makarchikov A.F. Lakaye B. Gulyai I.E. Czerniecki J. Coumans B. Wins P. Grisar T. Bettendorff L. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 1477-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 11Schellenberger A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1385: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The presence of TTP in organisms as diverse as prokaryotes through mammals suggests that it may play some fundamental role in cell metabolism and/or cell signaling. Two thiamine analogs, oxythiamine and pyrithiamine, are known to induce symptoms associated with thiamine deficiency in both mice and rats (Fig. 1). However, the symptoms produced by the two analogs are distinct (12Rindi G. Patrini C. Nauti A. Bellazzi R. Magni P. Metab. Brain Dis. 2003; 18: 245-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Oxythiamine treatment produces anorexia and lethargy, but not the neurological deficits associated with Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome and oxythiamine does not appear to deplete thiamine levels (13Gubler C.J. Murdock D.S. J. Nutr. Sci. Vitaminol. (Tokyo). 1982; 28: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Oxythiamine is a competitive substrate of TPK and can be phosphorylated by TPK to form oxythiamine pyrophosphate (14Rindi G. de Giuseppe L. Ventura U. J. Nutr. 1963; 81: 47-154Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Oxythiamine pyrophosphate (OPP) binds to and inhibits TPP-dependent enzymes and induces a functional thiamine deficiency because the catalytically critical 4′-NH2 group of thiamine pyrophosphate is substituted by a hydroxyl group thereby rendering both the cofactor and enzyme non-functional. In contrast, pyrithiamine administration produces neurological symptoms and appears to deplete thiamine levels (15Gubler C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 3112-3120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism by which pyrithiamine inhibits TPK and whether it can be phosphorylated by TPK is still unclear (16Machlin L.J. Machlin L.J. Handbook of Vitamins. 2nd. Marcel Dekker, New York1991: 233-281Google Scholar). In addition, little is known about the mechanism by which TPK catalyzes its reaction and the role the enzyme plays in maintaining thiamine phosphoester homeostasis. We have previously solved mouse TPK structures in complexes with thiamine (17Timm D.E. Liu J. Baker L.J. Harris R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and TPP (18Liu J.Y. Timm D.E. Harris R.A. Hurley T.D. Patel M.S. Jordan F. Thiamine: Catalytic Mechanism and Role in Normal and Disease States. Marcel Dekker, New York2002: 29-42Google Scholar). In this report, we describe the ternary structure of mouse TPK complexed with pyrithiamine pyrophosphate (PPP) and AMP at 2.5-Å resolution. Our crystal structure as well as data generated by kinetic assays and mass spectrometry showed that pyrithiamine can be phosphorylated by TPK. Moreover, the identification of the nucleotide bound to mouse TPK provides additional insights into the catalytic mechanism of TPK. Crystallization, Structure Solution, and Refinement—The recombinant His-tagged mouse TPK was purified by nickel-chelate chromatography and dialyzed and concentrated as described previously (17Timm D.E. Liu J. Baker L.J. Harris R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Crystallization experiments were set up by incubating mouse TPK with pyrithiamine and MgATP prior to adding the equilibrium mixture of enzyme, substrate, and products to the previously determined crystallization conditions. The following protocol was used for these incubations: solutions containing 2.5 mm, 5.0 mm, 12.5 mm, or 25 mm of both, pyrithiamine and Mg2+/ATP at pH 7.0 were mixed in a 1:2 volume ratio with an 11 mg/ml enzyme solution and incubated at room temperature for 45 min. These four separate mixtures created solutions that were 0.83 mm, 1.7 mm, 4.2 mm, and 8.3 mm in substrate concentration and 7.4 mg/ml (0.28 mm) in enzyme concentration. Based on the known kinetic properties of mouse TPK we estimated that 45 min was sufficient to reach equilibrium for these reaction mixtures. To initiate crystallization, 3 μl of the equilibrium reaction mixture was mixed with 2 μlofthe crystallization solution containing 2.0 m ammonium sulfate, 0.1 m HEPES, and 3% polyethylene glycol 400, pH 7.1. The crystallization experiment utilized the hanging drop vapor diffusion geometry, and the trays were incubated at room temperature. Crystals appeared within 2 weeks. The size of the crystals obtained in this manner tends to be smaller at the higher concentrations of Mg2+/ATP. To make solutions for cryopreservation of the crystals prior to exposure to x-rays, a second reaction was set up with 60 mm pyrithiamine, 120 mm MgATP, pH 7.0, and 0.15 μg/ml mouse TPK, and the reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Then the reaction mixture is mixed with the mother liquor solution from which the crystal was obtained in a ratio of 1:2. Crystals were soaked with the mixture for another 30 min to 1 h before they were transferred to a similarly preincubated mixture to which 15% (v/v) glycerol had been added. The crystals were flash-frozen in a supercooled gaseous nitrogen stream operated at -180 °C and evaluated for diffraction quality. The diffraction data were collected to 2.5-Å resolution using the oscillation method and 0.5 degree oscillation widths at beam line 19ID at the Advanced Photon Source located at the Argonne National Laboratory. The raw diffraction data were indexed, integrated, and scaled using HKL2000 (19Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Carter Jr., C.W. Sweet R.M. Methods in Enzymology. Academic Press, New York1997: 307-326Google Scholar) and were converted into structure factors using the program package CCP4 (20Collaborative Computer Project No. 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19748) Google Scholar). The isomorphous apo-mouse TPK structure, after removal of solvent molecules, was used directly to perform the first round of refinement.

Coordinates for AMP were obtained from the PDB. The coordinate file for PPP was created using the program CORINA (23Gasteiger J. Rudolph C. Sadowski J. Tetrahedron Comp. Method. 1990; 3: 537-547Crossref Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 24Sadowski J. Rudolph C. Gasteiger J. Analytica Chimica Acta. 1992; 265: 233-241Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The parameter and topology file for AMP and PPP was generated by the program Xplo2D (20Collaborative Computer Project No. 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19748) Google Scholar), with manual adjustments to the default weighting schemes for the dihedral angles. Kinetic Studies—Kinetic activity assays were performed using a coupled enzyme system (26Bergmeyer H.U. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. 2nd. Verlag Chemie Weinhein Academic Press, New York1974: 2127-2131Crossref Google Scholar) that included mouse TPK, myokinase (Sigma), pyruvate kinase (Sigma), and lactate dehydrogenase (Sigma). In this assay, each mole of AMP generated by mouse TPK results in the oxidation of two moles of NADH. The disappearance of NADH was monitored at 340 nm. One unit is defined by the amount of enzyme required to convert 1 nmol of thiamine to TPP per minute. The 1-ml standard reaction mixture contains 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.4, 40 mm phosphoenolpyruvate (Sigma), 6 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP, pH 7.4, 400 μm pyrithiamine (Sigma), or thiamine (Sigma), 30 units of lactate dehydrogenase (Sigma), 30 units of pyruvate kinase (Sigma), 30 units of myokinase (Sigma), and 0.2 mm NADH (Sigma). The reaction was initiated by the addition of 50 μg of TPK. To rule out the possibility that pyrophosphate was produced when pyrithiamine was the substrate, a reagent kit to detect pyrophosphate (Sigma) was used. This kit uses another coupled enzyme assay system consisting of fructose-6-phosphate kinase (pyrophosphate-dependent), aldolase, triosephosphate isomerase, and α-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase. The reaction was carried out by incubating a 0.5-ml mixture containing 0.2 m HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm thiamine or pyrithiamine, 5 mm ATP, pH 7.4 and 5 mm MgCl2 and 45 μg of mouse TPK at 37 °C for 10 min, 1 h, 8 h, and overnight. The reactions were stopped by heating at 100 °C for 5 min, at which point 17 μl of the reaction mixture were removed and mixed with 983 μl of the pyrophosphate reagent kit containing NADH. The reaction was monitored spectrophotometrically at 340 nm for the oxidation of NADH. Mass Spectroscopy Analysis—We attempted to detect the existence of PPP in the reaction mixture directly by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. A 0.5-ml reaction mixture containing 100 μm MgCl2, 500 μm ATP, pH 7.4, 15 μg of mouse TPK, and 1 mm pyrithiamine or 1 mm thiamine was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. A negative control reaction was also prepared without added enzyme. After 30 min of incubation, methanol was mixed with reaction mixture to achieve a final concentration of 50% (v/v). The assay sample was injected into a Finnigan LCQ™/MSn system at a rate of 3.00 μl/min. Formic acid was added to a final concentration of 0.1% to samples analyzed in positive ion mode, whereas 1% ammonium hydroxide was added to samples analyzed in the negative ion mode. Positive and negative ions were scanned by the Xcalibur software package that fell between m/z ranges of 100 and 1000. The spray voltage was set at 4.00 kV. Data from 10 continuous scans were collected and saved. Structure of Mouse TPK Complexed with Pyrithiamine Pyrophosphate and MgAMP—Purified mouse TPK was incubated with pyrithiamine and Mg2+/ATP to generate an equilibrium substrate/product mixture for crystallization. The resulting diffraction data were isomorphous with the apoenzyme structure, which was used directly to solve the structure of this complex. The structure has been refined to 2.5 Å with good geometry (Table 1). We observed strong electron density in the resulting structure consistent with a pyrophosphorylated product of pyrithiamine in both subunits of the asymmetric unit (Fig. 2). In addition, electron density consistent with the structure of AMP was initially identified in both subunits of the dimeric enzyme. However, subsequent refinement and difference feature analysis suggests that only the A subunit contains a fully occupied AMP molecule, whereas the B subunit appears to contain mixed occupancy of AMP and the buffer molecule HEPES. The latter of which is modeled into the B subunit as the resulting difference maps show fewer significant positive and negative features with this assignment. This is the first reported structure of TPK to which ATP or AMP is bound.TABLE 1Crystallographic statistics of data collection and refinement for mouse TPK-PPP-MgAMP complex structure RMSD, root mean square deviation.Data setsPPP-MgAMP-mouse TPKData collectionWavelength1.00 ÅMosaicity0.8Space groupP3121Resolution (Å)30–2.5Cell constantsa, b, c (Å)89.36, 89.36, 141.43α, β, γ (°)90, 90, 120Measured reflections87,425Unique reflections21,991Completeness (%)94.5Rsym (%)11.7 (61.4)RefinementRwork/Rfree (%)23.7 (25.2)RMSD bond length (Å)0.91RMSD bond angles (°)1.64 Open table in a new tab Mouse TPK exists as a homodimer in this space group (Fig. 3). No significant overall structural differences were found between this structure and the binary TPP and thiamine complexes of TPK with a RMSD of 0.38 Å and 0.39 Å of all main chain atoms, respectively. The products PPP and AMP together occupy a long groove, which is ∼30 Å in length, 8 Å wide, and 8 Å deep. However, this binding groove is not closed, but is relatively open to the solvent. Two PPP molecules and two magnesium ions are bound in the structure. Similar to TPP in the TPP-complexed structure of TPK, PPP is found at the interface between the two subunits and adopts the F-conformation (ΦT = 15° and ΦP = 74° in the A subunit and ΦT = 27° and ΦP = 68° in the B subunit) (18Liu J.Y. Timm D.E. Harris R.A. Hurley T.D. Patel M.S. Jordan F. Thiamine: Catalytic Mechanism and Role in Normal and Disease States. Marcel Dekker, New York2002: 29-42Google Scholar, 27Pletcher J. Sax M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1972; 94: 3998-4005Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The similarity of the PPP and TPP structures extends to the residues with which the respective products interact in the active site where all side chains are similarly placed in the PPP structure as found in the TPP structure (Fig. 4).FIGURE 4Stereoview of the PPP binding pocket. An overlay of the TPP-bound structure onto the PPP-bound structure of TPK showing the position of the bound TPP molecule relative to the PPP molecule. Both TPP (gold) and PPP adopt a similar F-conformation in mouse TPK. A water molecule that is unique to the PPP structure forms a hydrogen bond with Lys103 and is in close proximity to the oxygen atom of PPP is also illustrated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The one well-ordered AMP molecule bound in this structure adopts the C3′-endo anti-conformation for the adenosine group (Fig. 5). The major points of contact between the bound AMP molecule and TPK involve residues 25-26, 45-47, 99-101, 127-131, and 134-135. There are no direct hydrogen bonds between the enzyme and the adenine ring, but numerous van der Waals contacts are made. Two of these interactions are worth highlighting: one is between the main chain nitrogen atom of Arg131 and the N6 atom of the adenine and the other is between the main chain oxygen of Gly129 and the N1 atom. The location of these interactions and the lack of other specific interactions suggest that ATP may not be a specific substrate and that other nucleotide triphosphates can be utilized. The remaining interactions are largely hydrophobic contacts to the faces of the adenine ring and are provided by residues Gly127, Leu128, and Gly129. The main chain amide nitrogen atoms of Phe101 and Asn45 form hydrogen bonds to the O3′ and the O4′ atoms of the ribose ring, respectively. The negatively charged phosphoryl group interacts with the main chain amide of Gly47 and the side chain amide nitrogen of Asn25. Lastly, the bound Mg2+ ion coordinates with one of phosphoryl oxygen atoms of AMP. The binding of magnesium to the enzyme and products shifts the loop comprised of residues 71-75 (Fig. 6). The RMSD between the metal-bound conformation and other TPK structures for all atoms in this loop is 2.49 Å and 1.72 Å for just the main chain atoms. Both Mg2+ ions are octahedrally coordinated, but the nature of the interactions differs between the two subunits because of the difference in ligand occupancy in the B subunit. In the A subunit, the six coordinating interactions involve the α-phosphoryl of PPP, the phosphoryl group of AMP, and the side chain carboxylate groups of residues 46, 71, 73, and 100 (Fig. 7). The square plane of the octahedron is formed by the interactions contributed by the α-phosphoryl of PPP and the side chain carboxylates of Asp100, Asp46, and Asp73. The phosphoryl group of AMP and the side chain carboxylate of Asp71 form the two axial positions of the coordination sphere.FIGURE 7Stereoview of magnesium binding in subunit A.

The atoms are colored according to atom types, and the dashed lines and distances indicate the coordinating atoms and their distances to the bound magnesium ion.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Evidence of PPP Formation from Kinetic Studies—The mechanism by which pyrithiamine inhibits the production of TPP by TPK was studied using both coupled enzymatic assays and by direct detection of the reaction products by mass spectrometry. AMP production was measured in the reaction mixture when thiamine or pyrithiamine was provided as the substrate for mouse TPK using a coupled enzyme assay system. The rate of AMP production with pyrithiamine was found to be 60 nmol/mg mouse TPK/min, which is about 80% of the rate obtained when thiamine was used as the substrate. Consequently, AMP was produced from ATP when thiamine or pyrithiamine was used as substrate for mouse TPK. However, it is possible that pyrithiamine binds to TPK, but promotes the hydrolysis of ATP to AMP and pyrophosphate. To rule out this possibility, we tested the pyrithiamine-containing reaction mixture for the existence of pyrophosphate using another coupled assay system. No pyrophosphate molecule was detected in the reaction mixture. The enzymatic data support, but do not provide, positive evidence for the production of a pyrophosphorylated product of pyrithiamine, PPP. To detect the existence of PPP in the reaction mixture and further confirm what we observed in our structure, we performed mass spectrometry by injecting the reaction mixture into a mass spectrometer. A mass peak consistent with pyrithiamine (259 daltons) was clearly identified in the reaction mixture with or without added enzyme. Another peak with an m/z ratio of 415.5 was identified only in the reaction mixture with added enzyme; this mass is consistent with the PPP molecule carrying a single negative charge. Positive control experiments using thiamine in the reaction mixture were run in parallel. Thiamine was identified by a peak corresponding to an m/z ratio of 264.9 in positive ion detection mode in both the reaction mixtures with or without added enzyme. Operating in negative ion mode, an additional mass peak with an m/z ratio of 211.4 was present only in the reaction mixture with added enzyme. This peak corresponds to the mass of TPP carrying two negative charges. It is unclear whether these charge differences are related to inherent differences in the pKa of the pyrophosphoryl groups of these compounds or whether slight differences in the final pH of the sample injected into the instrument influenced the observed charge distributions. The structure of mouse TPK in a ternary complex with PPP and Mg2+/AMP has been solved to 2.5-Å resolution by crystallization of a preformed equilibrium substrate/product mixture. This was a surprising result, because much of the available literature would suggest that pyrithiamine exerts its inhibitory effect without being an alternative substrate, such as that observed for oxythiamine (14Rindi G. de Giuseppe L. Ventura U. J. Nutr. 1963; 81: 47-154Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In addition to this structural result, we consistently detected the production of AMP in the enzymatic reaction mixture when pyrithiamine was provided as the substrate, and we detected the presence of PPP in the reaction mixture by performing mass spectrometry on the reaction products. Therefore, we conclude that similar to the action of oxythiamine, pyrithiamine is also a substrate for TPK and can be converted to its pyrophosphorylated product, PPP. In agreement with our results, Iwashima et al. (28Iwashima A. Wakabayashi Y. Nose Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1976; 79: 845-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) detected the presence of pyrithiamine pyrophosphate in rat brain tissue and in the reaction mixture catalyzed by partially purified pig TPK. Although oxythiamine and pyrithiamine are structurally similar and can both be converted by TPK to their phosphorylated products (Ref. 14Rindi G. de Giuseppe L. Ventura U. J. Nutr. 1963; 81: 47-154Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar and present work), the symptoms produced by them in animals are clearly different. Administration of oxythiamine to animals produces primarily metabolic aberrations such as lethargy and anorexia while the administration of pyrithiamine to animals produces neurological problems similar to Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome. The reasons for different physiological effects of the two analogs are currently unknown. It is known that OPP can inhibit the activity of TPP-dependent enzymes because the catalytically important 4′-amino group of TPP is replaced by a hydroxyl group in OPP that prevents the deprotonation of the C2 atom, thereby inactivating the coenzyme and, consequently, the enzyme (14Rindi G. de Giuseppe L. Ventura U. J. Nutr. 1963; 81: 47-154Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 15Gubler C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 3112-3120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, OPP would appear to disrupt cellular events primarily via inhibition of TPP-dependent enzymes and thereby produces mainly metabolic aberrations. However, thiamine pyrophosphate is also the precursor of TMP and TTP. TTP is believed to play important roles in brain and nerve tissues. Pyrithiamine pyrophosphate may disrupt thiamine phosphoester homeostasis through interference with the production or function of TMP/TTP, thereby producing mainly neurological disorders similar to Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome. The differential fate of OPP and PPP may be related to the chemical differences in thiazolium and pyridine rings. When we manually modeled PPP into the TPP site of the E1 component of the branched chain ketoacid dehydrogenase enzyme (PDB code 1OLS) we observed little difference in the way that PPP would be predicted to bind to TPP-requiring enzymes from a steric point of view. However, there is no stabilizing force to keep PPP in the V-conformation. In"

Excitatory neurotransmission in the mammalian central nervous system is mediated predominantly by the acidic amino acid glutamate. In addition to mediating swift synaptic depolarization, glutamatergic neurotransmission is important for physiological processes such as synapse development and synaptic plasticity (1Monaghan D.T.

However, high levels of extracellular glutamate result in excessive activation of glutamate receptors, a factor that presumably contributes to the cytotoxicity associated with stroke, hypoglycemia, and brain injury (4Choi D.W.

In contrast to other neurotransmitter transporters, EAAC1 is expressed predominantly on postsynaptic neurons, where it is localized to perisynaptic membrane (9Rothstein J.D. Martin L. Levey A.I.

Neurosci. 2001; 21: 8328-8338Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Antisense knock-down of the neuronal glutamate transporter revealed that transport by EAAC1 accounts for ∼40% of glutamate uptake in the hippocampus (12Rothstein J.D. Dykes-Hoberg M. Pardo C.A.

EAAC1 expression has also been found on presynaptic GABA terminals (9Rothstein J.D. Martin L. Levey A.I. Dykes-Hoberg M. Jin L. Wu D. Nash N. Kuncl R.W.

Neurosci. 2003; 23: 2040-2048Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). EAAC1 is also unique in that only ∼30% of the transporter is expressed at the cell surface in both C6 glioma cells and primary neuronal cultures (16Sims K.D. Straff D.J. Robinson M.B. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 901-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). PDGF treatment results in approximately a 40–50% increase in EAAC1 at the cell surface, apparently from increased insertion of EAAC1 at the plasma membrane rather than decreased endocytosis. PMA has a larger effect on cell surface expression and appears both to increase insertion and to decrease endocytosis of EAAC1 (17Fournier K.M. González M.I. Robinson M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34505-34513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The effect of PDGF on other glutamate transporters has not been examined. The bulk of glutamate uptake in the cortex is mediated by GLT-1, which is enriched on astrocytic processes that ensheath the synapse (for review, see Refs. 8Danbolt N.C. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 65: 1-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3800) Google Scholar and 20Robinson M.B. Neurochem. Int. 1999; 33: 479-491Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The mechanisms underlying PDGF-stimulated trafficking of EAAC1 as well as how signals are transduced by transporters to result in trafficking are unknown. In the present study, we sought to identify amino acid motifs in EAAC1 which are involved in PDGF-induced trafficking of EAAC1 to the cell surface. By identifying residues involved in this regulation, we hoped to elucidate mechanisms underlying PDGF-stimulated trafficking of EAAC1.

Cells were used up to passage 60, and no gross morphological changes or changes in experimental effects were observed resulting from passage number. Generation of Mutant Transporters—Chimeric glutamate transporters were constructed previously using cDNAs encoding GLT-1 and EAAC1 rat transporter subtypes (21Kalandadze A. Wu Y. Robinson M.B. J.

Myc-EAAC1 plasmid was constructed by subcloning full-length rat EAAC1 (amino acids 1–523) into the pCMV-Myc plasmid from Clontech, using XhoI and EcoRI restriction sites. Myc-EAAC1 truncated mutants were created by PCR amplification and subcloning into the pCMV-Myc plasmid, with Asp513 as the last amino acid of Myc-EAAC1Δ10 (amino acids 1–513) and Val503 as the last amino acid of Myc-EAAC1Δ20 (amino acids 1–503). Amino acid substitution mutants were created using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) and pCMV-Myc-EAAC1 or EEEG chimera templates.

Transient Transfection of C6 Glioma Cells—C6 cells were grown to 50–60% confluence in 10-cm plates before the introduction of cDNA plasmids with a cationic lipid-based procedure, GenePorter. Cells were transfected with 6–10 μg of cDNA mixed with 30–50 μl of GenePorter in a 1 μg:5 μl ratio, ∼18 h prior to experimental use. Biotinylation of Cell Surface Transporters—C6 cells were serum-starved in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin for 2 h prior to treatment with vehicle, PDGF (20 ng/ml), or PMA (100 nm). Cell surface proteins were then biotinylated as described previously (17Fournier K.M. González M.I. Robinson M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34505-34513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 18Davis K.E. Straff D.J. Weinstein E.A. Bannerman P.G. Correale D.M. Rothstein J.D. Robinson M.B. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2475-2485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cell monolayers were rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS, pH 7.35, containing 0.1 mm CaCl2 and 1.0 mm MgCl2. The cells were then incubated in 2 ml of biotinylation solution (1 mg/ml NHS-biotin in PBS Ca/Mg) for 25 min at 4 °C with gentle agitation. The solution was aspirated, and excess biotin was quenched by incubating the cells with PBS Ca/Mg containing 100 mm glycine for 25 min at 4 °C with gentle shaking. Cells were then lysed in 1 ml of radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer containing protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml leupeptin, 250 μm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm iodoacetamide) and phosphatase inhibitors (10 mm sodium fluoride, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate). After removal of cellular debris by centrifugation, biotinylated proteins were batch extracted using UltraLink immobilized monomeric avidin (avidin beads). SDS-PAGE loading buffer was added to cell lysate, biotinylated proteins (cell surface proteins), and nonbiotinylated proteins (intracellular proteins). Each of these fractions was diluted and loaded such that the sum of immunoreactivity in the nonbiotinylated and biotinylated fractions should equal the immunoreactivity found in the lysate, if the yield from avidin extraction is 100%. Measurement of Na+-dependent Transport Activity—Transport activity in C6 glioma was measured in 12-well plates as described previously (22Dowd L.A. Robinson M.B. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 508-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). After preincubation with PDGF, C6 cells were assayed in a 37 °C water bath. Wells were rinsed twice with either 1 ml of warm Na+- or choline-containing buffer and then incubated with 0.5 μm l-[3H]glutamate for 5 min. These washes and incubation period result in a 10-min delay between the end of treatment with PDGF and conclusion of the measure of transporter activity. After stopping uptake of radioactive glutamate, the cells were solubilized, and samples were taken for analysis of radioactivity in a scintillation counter. Na+-dependent uptake was calculated as the difference in radioactivity accumulated in the presence and absence of Na+. Immunoprecipitation—After treatment, C6 cells were washed twice with PBS Ca/Mg and then lysed in 1 ml of radioimmunoprecipitation buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (listed above). Lysates were precleared by shaking with 40 μl of protein-G agarose beads at 4 °C for 1 h, and then 450 μg of cell lysate protein was mixed overnight at 4 °C with 4 μg immunoprecipitation antibody (mouse monoclonal anti-Myc, rabbit polyclonal anti-EAAC1, mouse monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine, or rabbit polyclonal anti-phosphotyrosine) or 4 μg of rabbit or mouse IgG. Proteins were precipitated by incubating with 25 μl of protein-G agarose beads for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were washed four times with radioimmunoprecipitation buffer and solubilized at 95 °C for 5 min in 25 μl of SDS sample buffer. Western Blot Analysis—Proteins were resolved on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes, and blocked for 1 h in TBS-T (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Tween 20) containing 1% nonfat dry milk. Membranes were then probed with the appropriate primary antibody: anti-EAAC1 (1:75), anti-GLT-1 (1:10,000), anti-actin (1:5,000), anti-HA (1:500), monoclonal anti-Myc (1:500), polyclonal anti-Myc (1:1,000), or anti-PDGF receptor (1:1,000). Membranes were washed and then incubated with anti-rabbit or anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase IgG (1:5,000). Protein bands were visualized with ECL. Immunoreactivity was quantified using NIH Image software. We routinely see an immunoreactive band at ∼66 kDa, which corresponds to EAAC1 monomer, and a band at ∼218 kDa, which corresponds to EAAC1 multimer (16Sims K.D. Straff D.J. Robinson M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5228-5237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 23Haugeto Ø. Ullensveng K. Levy L.M. Chaudhry F.A. Honore T. Neilsen M. Lehre K.P. Danbolt N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27715-27722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Within each fraction, the optical densities of both monomer and multimer bands were summed and used to quantitate EAAC1 immunoreactivity. Quantitation of the monomer band alone yielded similar results. Transporter immunoreactivity in each fraction (lysate, cell surface, or intracellular fraction) was normalized to the amount of actin in the lysate fraction. The amount of transporter observed in a fraction was expressed as a percentage of transporter in the corresponding control (vehicle) fraction. Actin immunoreactivity was used both as a loading control and to ensure that cells were intact during the biotinylation procedure. Experiments in which biotinylated actin was greater than 30% (consistent with cell lysis) were excluded. Based on this criterion 7 of 163 experiments were excluded. In four experiments the control construct, Myc-EAAC1, did not respond to PDGF; therefore results for all constructs tested in those experiments were not included. Data are presented as the means ± S.E. and compared using one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc analysis or paired t test. These tests were employed to compare the effect of PDGF on chimeric/mutant transporters to the effect of PDGF on wild-type transporters. In addition, for each construct we compared the effects of PDGF (as a percentage) with the effects of vehicle (100%) using a one-sample t test. Time Course of Effects of PDGF on EAAC1 Activity and Cell Surface Expression—Previously, we have shown that treating C6 glioma with PDGF results in an increase in Na+-dependent transport activity. This is associated with an increase in EAAC1 at the cell surface, as assessed by biotinylation and Western analysis (16Sims K.D. Straff D.J. Robinson M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5228-5237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The central nervous system-derived C6 glioma cell line is an attractive system to study EAAC1 in isolation because it expresses EAAC1 but none of the other glutamate transporter subtypes (18Davis K.E. Straff D.J. Weinstein E.A. Bannerman P.G. Correale D.M. Rothstein J.D. Robinson M.B. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2475-2485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In past experiments, l-[3H]glutamate transport and EAAC1 cell surface immunoreactivity were measured after a 30-min treatment with PDGF; however, other time points were not tested. To determine when the effect of PDGF on EAAC1 was maximal, C6 cells were treated with PDGF for different times, and cell surface expression was measured by biotinylation and Western analysis. Treatment with vehicle alone had no effect on cell surface expression of EAAC1 at any time point (data not shown). PDGF increased cell surface expression of EAAC1 maximally (178 ± 17% of control) at 15 min (Fig. 1, A and B). PDGF increased glutamate transport activity maximally (183 ± 2% of control) at 5 min (Fig. 1C); however, multiple washes and a 5-min incubation period with radioactive glutamate resulted in a 10-min delay between the end of treatment with PDGF and conclusion of the measure of transporter activity. Therefore, the maximal increases occur at similar times, and subsequent biotinylation experiments were conducted after 15 min of treatment. PDGF Stimulation Has a Differential Effect on EAAC1 and GLT-1— Although the effects of PDGF on EAAC1 are well documented, it was unknown whether PDGF affects the astroglial glutamate transporter, GLT-1. To determine the effect of PDGF on GLT-1, C6 cells were transiently transfected with a cDNA clone encoding GLT-1, and cell surface expression was assessed by biotinylation and Western analysis. Approximately 80% of GLT-1 was localized to the plasma membrane in the basal state (Table 1), and there was no increase in cell surface GLT-1 immunoreactivity with PDGF treatment (99 ± 6% of control) (Fig. 2, A and C). In additional experiments, 30% of endogenous EAAC1 was located at the cell surface in the basal state (Table 1), and PDGF increased cell surface expression of EAAC1 to 148 ± 4% of control (Fig. 2, B and C), in agreement with past studies (16Sims K.D. Straff D.J. Robinson M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5228-5237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 17Fournier K.M. González M.I. Robinson M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34505-34513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Therefore, in contrast to its effects on EAAC1, PDGF had no effect on subcellular localization of GLT-1.TABLE 1Basal biotinylated transporter and effects of PDGF on biotinylated transporter C6 glioma were transiently transfected with different transporter cDNAs. Basal biotinylated transporter is the amount of transporter in the biotinylated fraction after vehicle treatment, expressed as a percentage of total transporter.

Boudker O. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2004; 431: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar), these glutamate transporters are thought to contain eight membrane-spanning domains, with cytoplasmic amino and carboxyl termini. The mammalian members of this family share 50–60% sequence similarity (for review, see Ref. 8Danbolt N.C. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 65: 1-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3800) Google Scholar), suggesting that the differential effect of PDGF could be related to differences in primary structure of these transporters. Therefore, the differential effect of PDGF was used to define motifs of EAAC1 involved in PDGF-induced redistribution. In an earlier study, chimeras consisting of domains originating from EAAC1 or GLT-1 (Fig. 3A) were used to identify structural motifs required for PMA-induced regulation of GLT-1 (21Kalandadze A. Wu Y. Robinson M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45741-45750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Chimeras containing the carboxyl terminus of EAAC1 were tagged with an HA epitope to distinguish them from endogenously expressed EAAC1. Because PDGF had no effect on cell surface expression of GLT-1, substitution of an EAAC1 domain with an equivalent domain of GLT-1 allowed us to determine whether that EAAC1 domain was necessary for PDGF-dependent translocation. C6 glioma were transfected with cDNAs encoding chimeric transporters, and trafficking was assessed by biotinylation of cell surface proteins and Western analysis. PDGF increased cell surface expression of HA-EAAC1 to 160 ± 12% of control (Fig. 3D), indicating that the HA tag did not interfere with this regulated trafficking of EAAC1. One problem we confronted is that C6 cells display a robust cross-reacting band to the HA antibody, which is directly above the transporter monomer band; however, we were able to resolve the HA-transporter monomer and multimer bands from this cross-reacting band. An untransfected lysate sample was always run in an adjacent lane to confirm the difference between the cross-reacting band and transporter bands. Similarly to GLT-1, all chimeras containing GLT-1 domains displayed a higher percentage of transporters at the cell surface in the basal state (Table 1). However, there was intracellular transporter available for redistribution. Initially, multiple chimeras were analyzed; for instance, HA-EEGE responded to PDGF similarly to EAAC1 (data not shown). However, the focus was soon switched to EEEG because of the apparent difference in response to PDGF compared with EAAC1. PDGF had no effect on cell surface expression of EEEG (98 ± 5% of control), which differed significantly from the percent change at the cell surface of endogenous EAAC1 or transfected HA-EAAC1 (Fig. 3, B and D). Therefore, residues within the 37 carboxyl-terminal amino acids of EAAC1 are required for PDGF-dependent redistribution. The reciprocal chimera, HA-GGGE, consists of three GLT-1 domains and the carboxyl terminus of EAAC1. PDGF incr"
https://openalex.org/W2122646957,"Myasthenia gravis (MG) and experimental autoimmune MG (EAMG) are T cell-dependent antibody-mediated autoimmune disorders, in which the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) is the major autoantigen. DNA microarray analysis revealed increased levels of several phosphodiesterase (PDE) subtypes in lymph node cells (LNC) and muscles of EAMG rats compared with healthy controls. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis indicated that EAMG is characterized by an increase of PDE subtypes 1, 3, 4, and 7 in LNC and of PDE subtypes 2, 3, 4, and 7 in muscles. Pentoxifylline (PTX), a general PDE inhibitor, inhibited the progression of EAMG when treatment started at either the acute or chronic stages of disease. This suppression was associated with down-regulation of humoral and cellular AChR-specific responses, as well as down-regulation of PDE4, TNF-alpha, IL-18, IL-12, and IL-10 in LNC and of PDEs 1, 4, 7, and TNF-alpha in muscles. The expression of Foxp3, a transcription factor essential for CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cell function, was increased in splenocytes although the number of these cells remained unchanged. PTX also reduced the expression of the endopeptidase cathepsin-l, a marker of muscle damage, in EAMG muscles. This study demonstrates the involvement of PDE regulation in EAMG pathogenesis and suggests that PDE inhibitors may be considered for immunotherapy of MG."

It acts as an l-carnitine/γ-butyrobetaine exchanger and is predicted to span the membrane 12 times.

The Escherichia coli carnitine transporter is a member of the betaine, choline, and carnitine transporter (BCCT) 3The abbreviations used are: BCCT, betaine, choline, and carnitine transporter; DDM, β-d-dodecylmaltoside; DPPC, 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; POPC, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine. family of secondary transporters. The BCCT family comprises a large group of membrane proteins, which share the common functional feature of transporting substrates containing a quaternary ammonium group. Most transporters of this family utilize electrochemical gradients for substrate accumulation. Some respond to osmotic stress and take up osmoprotectants, such as glycine, betaine, proline, ectoine, or trehalose (1Kramer R. Morbach S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1658: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment of the proteins in the BCCT family shows two conserved regions, which are possibly involved in substrate binding. This includes a stretch of conserved residues along the putative transmembrane helices 3 and 4 and the adjacent loops. The second stretch comprises transmembrane 8 and an adjacent loop. This latter region is rich in tryptophan residues. Binding of the substrate causes a conformational change, which has been studied by analyzing tryptophan fluorescence emission in CaiT (2Jung H. Buchholz M. Clausen J. Nietschke M. Revermann A. Schmid R. Jung K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39251-39258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Unlike its homologue BetP, the protein sequence of CaiT shows no N- or C-terminal extensions. In BetP, these extensions are responsible for osmosensing and regulation (1Kramer R. Morbach S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1658: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). CaiT differs from the other members of this family also with respect to the use of the electrochemical gradient. It acts as an l-carnitine/γ-butyrobetaine exchanger and does not respond to osmotic stress (2Jung H. Buchholz M. Clausen J. Nietschke M. Revermann A. Schmid R. Jung K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39251-39258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). E. coli dehydrates l-carnitine accumulated by CaiT. The resulting crotonobetaine is used as an electron acceptor under anaerobic conditions, which results in the end product γ-butyrobetaine (3Jung H. Jung K. Kleber H.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1003: 270-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Many membrane proteins have a strong tendency to associate into oligomers. The oligomeric state of a particular protein may be essential for its function, as in the case of ion channels, or simply required for stability, as in the case of porins. Secondary transporters are diverse membrane proteins, which have been found in a variety of oligomeric states, that tend to be conserved in a given family or subfamily (4Veenhoff L.M. Heuberger E. Poolman B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 242-249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar).

Nature. 2004; 431: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar) and in BetP of the BCCT family (1Kramer R. Morbach S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1658: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The role of oligomers in secondary transporters is not always evident. For some, it has been shown or proposed that monomers cooperate with one another during transport (14Veenhoff L.M. Heuberger E. Poolman B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3056-3062Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 15Casey J.R. Reithmeier R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15726-15737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), implying that the oligomeric state is essential for function. Knowledge of the quaternary structure is also important for structural studies; for example, crystallization requires monodisperse solutions that contain only one oligomeric state. Unfortunately, determining the quaternary structure of a membrane protein is usually not trivial. A wide variety of techniques, including genetic approaches, chemical cross-linking, analytical ultracentrifugation, size exclusion chromatography, and electron microscopy, have been used (4Veenhoff L.M. Heuberger E. Poolman B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 242-249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), but no single technique is entirely satisfactory. We have used some of these techniques to determine the quaternary structure of CaiT and discuss its implications for function. Expression and Purification of CaiT—CaiT was expressed in E. coli strain BL21 plysS with either an N- or C-terminal His6 tag and purified as described previously (2Jung H. Buchholz M. Clausen J.

Gel dimensions were 16 cm × 18 cm × 1 mm. Linear polyacrylamide (6–16%) gradient gels were cast with 4% overlay. For SDS dissociation and redialysis, 50 μg of protein was incubated with 0.075% SDS for 5 min and then dialyzed overnight at room temperature. The dialysis buffer contained 0.05% (w/v) DDM at pH 8. Cross-linking of CaiT in Detergent—Different cross-linkers were added to 30 μg of protein in 25 mm KPi, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 0.05% DDM. Bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)succinate (Pierce) and disuccinimidyl suberate (Sigma)) were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) and added to a final concentration of 1 and 10 mm, respectively. As a control, Me2SO was added alone. Glutaraldehyde (Agar Scientific, Stansted, UK) was added to final concentrations of 0.25, 0.5, 2.5, or 5 mm. After incubation for 30 min at room temperature, the reaction was quenched by the addition of 1/6 volume of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. The cross-linked samples were then analyzed on 10% SDS gel stained with Coomassie Blue. Single Particle Analysis—Protein was diluted to a final concentration of 0.01 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.05% DDM, 10% glycerol, and 300 mm NaCl and applied to glow-discharged 400-mesh copper grids coated with a thin carbon film. The specimens were negatively stained with 1.5% uranylacetate. Electron micrographs were recorded under low dose conditions in a Philips CM120 electron microscope at 100 kV accelerating voltage and a calibrated magnification of 58,600×. Images were taken at a defocus range of 0.8–1 μm. Micrographs were digitized using a Zeiss SCAI scanner with an effective pixel size of 21 μm, corresponding to 0.36 nm on the scale of the specimen. Single particles were selected manually from the images using the program WEB (17Frank J. Radermacher M. Penczek P. Zhu J. Li Y. Ladjadj M. Leith A. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1808) Google Scholar). The images were processed using the program SPI-DER (17Frank J. Radermacher M. Penczek P. Zhu J. Li Y. Ladjadj M. Leith A. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1808) Google Scholar). Selected particles were windowed into 80 × 80 pixel boxes and normalized with the background of the electron micrograph (18Radermacher M. Wagenknecht T. Verschoor A. Frank J. J. Microsc. (Oxf.). 1987; 146: 113-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). The images were centered, and a first reference was obtained by reference-free alignment (19Marco S. Chagoyen M. de la Fraga L.G. Carazo J.M. Ultramicroscopy. 1996; 66: 5-10Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). All particles were then aligned to this new reference using simultaneous translational/rotational algorithms based on cross-correlations of two-dimensional radon transforms (20Radermacher M. Scan Micros. 1997; 11: 171-177Google Scholar, 21Radermacher M. Ruiz T. Wieczorek H. Gruber G. J. Struct. Biol. 2001; 135: 26-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The aligned particles were classified using pattern recognition by a neuronal network algorithm (22Marabini R. Carazo J.M. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 1804-1814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) of the program XMIPP (23Marabini R. Masegosa I.M. San Martin M.C. Marco S. Fernandez J.J. de la Fraga L.G. Vaquerizo C. Carazo J.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) using a field of 7 × 7 nodes. Several nodes were selected and used as references in multireference alignments. The aligned particles were assigned to the reference for which they showed the highest cross-correlation coefficient. Neuronal network analysis and multireference alignments were repeated several times until the particles in a class converged to a homogenous population. Two-dimensional Crystallization—Purified protein in DDM was reconstituted into various lipids (Avanti) at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml with varying lipid to protein ratios from 0.25 to 0.75 (w/w). The ternary mixture of protein, lipid, and detergent was incubated on ice for 1 h before dialysis. Dialysis was carried out for detergent removal against 25 mm AMPSO (3-N-(α-α-dimethyl-hydroxyethyl)-amino-2-hydroxypropane sulfonic acid), pH 9, 0.25 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 3 mm NaN3 for 7 days at 37 °C with a molecular mass cutoff of 14 kDa. Electron Microscopy and Image Processing—Two-dimensional crystals were stained with 1.5% uranylacetate. Images were recorded in a CM12 microscope operating at 120 kV in low dose mode with a magnification of 35–45,000×. Selected image areas of 4000 × 4000 pixels were digitized with a pixel size of 7 μm on a Zeiss SCAI scanner. Images were processed using the Medical Research Council image processing programs (24Henderson R. Baldwin J.M. Downing K.H. Lepault J. Zemlin F. Ultramicroscopy. 1986; 19: 147-178Crossref Scopus (634) Google Scholar, 25Crowther R.A. Henderson R. Smith J.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). Protein Purification and Blue Native Gel Electrophoresis—Typically we obtained up to 2.5 mg of pure protein from a liter of culture. It was possible to solubilize CaiT with a number of different detergents, but the protein was stable only in those with a carbon chain length of 10 or above, with the maltoside head group preferred. The purity of the protein was >95% after a single step of nickel affinity chromatography as judged by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. The protein was stable for more than a week at 4 °C in DDM without aggregation or proteolysis. The molecular mass of CaiT calculated from the amino acid sequence was ∼57.4 kDa, but the apparent mass estimated by SDS-PAGE was ∼36 kDa. Blue native gel electrophoresis of CaiT indicates a band at ∼250 kDa, a little above catalase, which was used as the marker, indicating that the transporter is an oligomer in detergent solution. The position of the band was not affected by the addition of substrate. The oligomer dissociated into monomers upon incubation with SDS prior to electrophoresis (Fig. 1A). When an SDS-treated sample was dialyzed against DDM buffer overnight, a ladder of clearly distinguished bands was observed on the blue native gel, with masses corresponding to a CaiT monomer, dimer, trimer, or tetramer. This ladder was used for estimating the apparent mass of the oligomer and indicated that CaiT is a trimer in detergent solution. The trimer was stable at pH values of from 5 to 9. At pH 4, it tended to precipitate. The CaiT trimer was not affected by a final DDM concentration up to 1.5% (data not shown). To check the stability of the protein in different detergents, DDM was exchanged on the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column by equilibration with buffer containing other detergents at a concentration of two times the critical micelle concentration. A representative gel is shown in Fig. 1C, with protein in DDM as a positive control and zwittergent3–12 as a negative control. In detergents with a carbon chain length of 9 or 10, a higher band corresponding to a CaiT hexamer was observed (Fig. 1C, lanes 2 and 4). Cross-linking—Purified protein in DDM solution was cross-linked with reagents of varying spacer lengths. When analyzed by SDS-PAGE, the control without the cross-linker migrated predominantly as a monomer at ∼36 kDa, as expected. A diffuse band corresponding to a dimer was also seen (Fig. 2). With increasing concentrations of cross-linker, higher oligomeric forms of CaiT were observed. The prominent band at ∼100 kDa corresponds to the trimer. At higher concentrations, small amounts of larger oligomers formed independent of the length of the cross-linker. Gel Filtration—CaiT co-purifies with the lipids phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylethanolamine as analyzed by thin-layer chromatography (data not shown). The oligomeric state of the CaiT-lipid-detergent complex in DDM was investigated by gel filtration on a Superose 6 column calibrated with soluble proteins. The transporter eluted from the column as a single peak with a retention time of 31.5 min, indicating an apparent size of the CaiT-lipid-detergent complex corresponding to a Stokes radius of 63 Å, similar to apoferritin (Fig. 3). Electron Microscopy and Single Particle Analysis—Protein purified in DDM was observed in the electron microscope as single particles. A total of 5015 particles was selected from 6 micrographs (Fig. 4A). After several steps of translational/rotational alignment using radon transforms and pattern recognition by neuronal networks (Fig. 4B), two homogenous particle classes were easily distinguished (Fig. 5, C and D). Class I contained 67.5% of the particles and showed clearly three round densities arranged in a triangle with an edge length of ∼85 Å. The diameter of each density was ∼38 Å. This was evidently a face-on view of a CaiT oligomer with 3-fold symmetry, either a trimer or a hexamer. Class II with 32.5% of the particles showed an arrangement of two apparently unconnected, elongated densities arranged parallel to one another. The density was weaker in the center of the elongated particles. The dimensions of the elongated particles were 85 × 43 Å. The center-to-center distance was ∼27 Å. This view can be interpreted as a sandwich of two trimers seen edge-on. The resolution of the class I and II averages were calculated to be 21 and 23 Å, respectively (Fig. 5, A and B), with a cutoff criterion of five times noise correlation.FIGURE 5Fourier ring correlation of averaged particles. The respective data sets were split into two groups and compared. The resolution was calculated with a cutoff criterion of five times noise correlation of 21 (A) and 23 Å (B). Scale bar, 10 nm. C and D represent two-dimensional averages of single particles showing two different orientations of the protein, face on view (C) and side view (D). 3350 and 1600 particles were averaged for C and D, respectively. E and F are the same as C and D, except with 3- or 2-fold symmetry applied, respectively. Scale bar is 10 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The effect of uranylacetate on the CaiT trimer was analyzed by blue native gel electrophoresis (Fig. 4C). A band corresponding to a CaiT hexamer was prominent at the concentrations of uranylacetate used for negative staining, indicating that the heavy metal salt promoted the association of CaiT trimers into symmetrical hexamers, presumably by charge screening of protein exposed on the membrane surface. Two-dimensional Crystallization—CaiT was reconstituted with lipid into proteoliposomes in a wide pH range. At pH 7.5–9, the protein formed two-dimensional lattices in the reconstituted membranes. The two-dimensional crystals assumed different shapes, with vesicular structures predominating, but occasionally tubular crystals were observed that are frequently found with other transporters. At the low lipid to protein ratio of ∼0.2 (w/w), the membranes were small and poorly ordered. The optimal lipid to protein ratio for two-dimensional lattice formation was 0.4–0.5, whereas at a higher lipid to protein ratio, the lipid vesicles tended not to contain protein, as indicated by freeze-fracture electron microscopy. The vesicular crystals showed a hexagonal lattice, and the initial crystals obtained had a tendency to stack (Fig. 6, A and C). An initial screen of lipids with different head groups and chain lengths (14 to 18) indicated that negatively charged lipids, such as phosphatidylglycerol or cardiolipin, promoted stacking. Therefore uncharged lipids were used in subsequent trials. Finally, the best two-dimensional lattices were obtained with DPPC and POPC under similar conditions. These vesicles containing the best two-dimensional lattices measured on average 0.5–1 μm (Fig. 6, B and D), but the resolution was limited to ∼25 Å, as indicated by crystallographic image processing. The unit cell of the two-dimensional crystals in isolated vesicles was a = b = 93 Å, γ = 120°, independent of the lipids used. The program ALLSPACE (26Valpuesta J.M. Carrascosa J.L. Henderson R. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 240: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) indicated that isolated vesicles had 3-fold symmetry, whereas the stacked membranes exhibited higher symmetries, such as P6 and P622. Images of the isolated vesicles were merged, and a projection map at 25 Å was calculated with P3 symmetry applied (Fig. 7). The approximate dimension of the trimer calculated from the projection map was ∼90 Å, and the diameter of a monomer density was ∼38 Å. We used different methods to investigate the oligomeric structure of CaiT. Determining the exact number of subunits in an oligomeric membrane protein by biochemical or hydrodynamic means is difficult because of the presence of unknown amounts of lipids and detergent in mixed micelles. Blue native electrophoresis has been used to study the oligomeric state of membrane proteins, including LacS (27Heuberger E.H. Veenhoff L.M. Duurkens R.H. Friesen R.H. Poolman B. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 591-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), SecYEG complex (28Bessonneau P. Besson V. Collinson I. Duong F. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 995-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), and glutamate transporters (29Gendreau S. Voswinkel S. Torres-Salazar D. Lang N. Heidtmann H. Detro-Dassen S. Schmalzing G. Hidalgo P. Fahlke C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39505-39512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We observed that CaiT migrates slightly >232 kDa (Fig. 1A). For membrane proteins with multiple membrane-spanning helices, the molecular mass on blue native gels has been shown to be up to 1.8 times greater than predicted from the amino acid sequence (27Heuberger E.H. Veenhoff L.M. Duurkens R.H. Friesen R.H. Poolman B. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 591-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) apparently because of bound stain. In our approach, we did not measure the amount of bound Coomassie stain. However, taking advantage of the observation that SDS dissociates the trimer into monomers, we promoted the formation of aggregates that resulted in a ladder of oligomers starting with the monomer (Fig. 1B). In this ladder, the band corresponding to a trimer migrates a little lower than the native protein. This may be due to bound SDS that has not been displaced by Coomassie stain. For other transporters, such as LacS (27Heuberger E.H. Veenhoff L.M. Duurkens R.H. Friesen R.H. Poolman B. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 591-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), an equilibrium between monomer and dimer has been observed, whereas a detergent-mediated change in the oligomeric state was found for SecYEG from E. coli (28Bessonneau P. Besson V. Collinson I. Duong F. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 995-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). By comparison, the trimer of CaiT appears to be very stable and dissociates only upon the addition of harsh detergents, such as SDS. This stability may be due to unusually strong ionic and hydrophobic interactions between the protein monomers or to lipid-protein interactions. In fact, negatively charged lipids have been shown to be important in the stability of oligomers, such as KcsA (30Valiyaveetil F.I. Zhou Y. MacKinnon R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10771-10777Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) and LHCII (31Standfuss J. Kühlbrandt W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36884-36891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The structures of AcrB and GltPh suggest that the central region between trimers may be filled with lipids (12Murakami S. Nakashima R. Yamashita E. Yamaguchi A. Nature. 2002; 419: 587-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar, 13Yernool D. Boudker O. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2004; 431: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). When purified CaiT was subjected to lipid analysis, we found both phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylglycerol co-purifying with the protein. We therefore believe that the stability of the CaiT trimer is a result of lipid-protein interactions. The presence of this oligomeric state is also supported by the cross-linking results (Fig. 2). Interpretation of the gel filtration profile of a membrane protein largely depends on the amount of bound detergent and the shape of the protein-detergent micelle. For secondary transporters with multiple membrane-spanning helices, the amount of bound DDM is in the range of 150–180 molecules/monomer, corresponding to 70–90 kDa (27Heuberger E.H. Veenhoff L.M. Duurkens R.H. Friesen R.H. Poolman B. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 591-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The molecular mass of the CaiT monomer calculated from the amino acid sequence is 57.4 kDa. Without bound detergent and lipid, a CaiT trimer would therefore have a molecular mass of 174 kDa, whereas the observed retention time of CaiT corresponds to ∼440 kDa (Fig. 3). This indicates clearly that the CaiT trimer binds detergent and lipid amounting to ∼240 kDa, corresponding to ∼160 DDM molecules/monomer. The formation of hexamers under normal conditions can be ruled out based on our observation of uranylacetate-induced hexamers on blue native gels (Fig. 4C) that were observed in the electron microscope. Initial two-dimensional crystallization trials were carried out with E. coli polar lipids in various pH ranges. The vesicles thus obtained were analyzed by freeze-fracture electron microscopy, which indicated a high level of protein incorporation (data not shown). However, ordering of the protein into two-dimensional lattices was observed only at pH 7.5 or above, presumably because of pH-dependent protein-protein or lipid-protein interactions. The membranes obtained with E. coli polar lipids were predominantly multiple layers and poorly ordered. Through a screen for lipids, better conditions for obtaining isolated crystalline vesicles were found with choline lipids. The vesicular two-dimensional crystals obtained with DPPC and POPC were used for electron microscopy and image processing to obtain information about the structure and the oligomeric state of the protein. The dimension of the trimer calculated from the projection map (Fig. 7) was very similar to that of the single particle, indicating a near-native structure in the detergent micelle (Fig. 5E). Among the high resolution structures of the secondary transporters known, AcrB (12Murakami S. Nakashima R. Yamashita E. Yamaguchi A. Nature. 2002; 419: 587-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar) and GltPh (13Yernool D. Boudker O. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2004; 431: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar) are trimers. AcrB is a 12-transmembrane helix protein that uses the proton gradient to remove drugs from the cell. GltPh probably co-transports glutamate with sodium and has eight transmembrane helices. The structures of both proteins differ significantly in the arrangement of transmembrane helices and the substrate translocation pathway (12Murakami S. Nakashima R. Yamashita E. Yamaguchi A. Nature. 2002; 419: 587-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar, 13Yernool D. Boudker O. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2004; 431: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). This highlights the importance of studying the structures of least one transporter from each family. In the BCCT family of secondary transporters, structural information is available only for BetP from Corynebacterium glutamicum at ∼8 Å resolution. The projection map reveals a trimer showing densities attributed to membrane-spanning helices surrounding two less dense regions, one or both of which might be related to substrate translocation (32Ziegler C. Morbach S. Schiller D. Kramer R. Tziatzios C. Schubert D. Kühlbrandt W. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 1137-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We found that CaiT, a homologue of BetP, is also a trimer with similar dimensions indicated by the two-dimensional crystals. From the structures of AcrB and GltP (12Murakami S. Nakashima R. Yamashita E. Yamaguchi A. Nature. 2002; 419: 587-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar, 13Yernool D. Boudker O. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2004; 431: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar), it is evident that each monomer in these trimeric membrane transporters harbors a single translocation channel. We believe that this will also be true for CaiT and BetP. A single translocation pore on the 3-fold axis of the trimer, with equal contributions from all three monomers, seems unlikely. So far, a corresponding arrangement has been found only in the ion channels, which have 4-fold symmetry. If each monomer of the BCCT transporters harbors its own independent transport pathway, this raises the question as to why they need to be trimers. There are two possible explanations. An oligomeric assembly might be required for functional cooperativity between subunits or allosteric regulation of the transport process, as has been shown for LacS (10Wang D.N. Kühlbrandt W. Sarabia V.E. Reithmeier R.A. EMBO J. 1993; 6: 2233-2239Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and proposed for anion exchanger (11Mindell J.A. Maduke M. Miller C. Grigorieff N. Nature. 2001; 409: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The oligomeric structure may also be required for the formation of an aqueous vestibule on the membrane surface, in which substrates are collected prior to passage through the individual monomers, as suggested for Gltph (13Yernool D. Boudker O. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2004; 431: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the trimer might be required simply for the correct folding and stability of the protein in the membrane. It is striking that many, if not most, membrane proteins are found as oligomers in the membrane, whereas a functional cooperativity between subunits is rarely evident. This may suggest that the oligomers form for reasons of protein stability or perhaps to adapt to the tight space and packing constraints in the membrane. In many cases, these oligomeric assemblies of membrane proteins are stable enough to withstand the solubilization of the membrane with detergent. Further functional and structural studies are required to address the question as to why oligomers of CaiT and other transport proteins form in the membrane and how they work. The E. coli carnitine transporter CaiT has been produced by homologous expression on a scale of several milligrams. The purified protein was reconstituted into proteoliposomes and formed two-dimensional crystals under defined conditions. The oligomeric state of CaiT was investigated by a range of techniques. Blue native gel electrophoresis and single-particle electron microscopy indicated that the protein was a trimer, as is its homologue BetP from C. glutamicum. Gel filtration of CaiT indicated a size similar to apoferritin, a soluble protein with a mass of 440 kDa, confirming that this method tends to overestimate the molecular mass of membrane proteins because of bound detergent and lipid, whereas a fully denaturing SDS gel tends to underestimate it because of partial unfolding of the hydrophobic protein even by harsh detergents. The projection map calculated by the image processing of two-dimensional crystals showed a trimer of the same dimension as the single particles with dimensions similar to those of BetP. This suggests that the transporters of the BCCT family are probably trimeric. In analogy to other secondary transporters with known high resolution structures, we assume that each CaiT monomer contains one substrate translocation path. The oligomer may be required for functional cooperativity or for the stability of protein in the membrane."

PYPM at neutral pH was in equilibrium between two spectroscopically distinct states. Absorption maxima of the acidic form (PYPMacid) and alkaline form (PYPMalkali) were located at 367 and 356 nm, respectively. Equilibrium was represented by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, in which apparent pKa was 6.4. Content of α- and/or β-structure of PYPMacid was significantly greater than PYPMalkali as demonstrated by the molar ellipticity at 222 nm. In addition, changes in amide I and II modes of β-structure in the difference Fourier transform infrared spectra for formation of PYPMacid was smaller than that of PYPMalkali. The vibrational mode at 1747 cm-1 of protonated Glu-46 was found as a small band for PYPMacid but not for PYPMalkali, suggesting that Glu-46 remains partially protonated in PYPMacid, whereas it is fully deprotonated in PYPMalkali. Small angle x-ray scattering measurements demonstrated that the radius of gyration of PYPMacid was 15.7 Å, whereas for PYPMalkali it was 16.2 Å. These results indicate that PYPMacid assumes a more ordered and compact structure than PYPMalkali. Binding of citrate shifts this equilibrium toward PYPMalkali. UV-visible absorption spectra and difference infrared spectra of the long lived intermediate formed from E46Q mutant was consistent with those of PYPMacid, indicating that the mutation shifts this equilibrium toward PYPMacid.

Photon absorption by the chromophore initiates the photocycle of PYP (7.Meyer T.E. Yakali E. Cusanovich M.A. Tollin G.

The primary photochemical event of PYP is the trans-cis isomerization of the chromophore (12.Kort R. Vonk H. Xu X. Hoff W.D. Crielaard W. Hellingwerf K.J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 13.Imamoto Y. Shirahige Y. Tokunaga F. Kinoshita T. Yoshihara K. Kataoka M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8997-9004Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), like bacterial retinal proteins. Several intermediates are then formed, followed by a return to the dark state in 100 ms under physiological conditions. During the photocycle, photon energy stored in the twisted chromophore is released to the protein moiety to form the putative signaling state (called PYPM, I2, or pB). Because of a largely blue-shifted absorption spectrum with respect to the dark state, as well as the long lifetime (∼100 ms), PYPM is easily detectable by UV-visible spectroscopy. This spectral blue shift is considered to be caused by protonation of the phenolic oxygen of the chromophore (5.Baca M. Borgstahl G.E.O. Boissinot M. Burke P.M. Williams D.R. Slater K.A. Getzoff E.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14369-14377Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 14.Imamoto Y. Mihara K. Hisatomi O. Kataoka M. Tokunaga F. Bojkova N. Yoshihara K. J. Biol.

Infrared spectroscopy demonstrated that PYPM is formed from its precursor (PYPL,I1, or pR) in two steps (15.Brudler R. Rammelsberg R. Woo T.T. Getzoff E.D. Gerwert K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 16.Xie A. Kelemen L. Hendriks J. White B.J. Hellingwerf K.J. Hoff W.D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1510-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). First, a proton at Glu-46 is transferred to the chromophore, but the global conformational change of the protein moiety does not take place at this stage, as shown by a small absorbance change of the amide mode. This intermediate (pB′) has a protonated chromophore, but the chromophore binding site is considered to be preserved. Second, a global conformational change takes place to form PYPM. As the lifetime of pB′ (∼1 ms) is not markedly different from pR (∼100 μs) and the absorption spectra of PYPM and pB′ are similar, isolation of pB′ has been difficult in steady-state measurement. Recently, the presence of pB′ between PYPL and PYPM has been established by time-resolved UV-visible spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy (17.Hendriks J. van Stokkum I.H. Hellingwerf K.J. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 1180-1191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 18.Joshi C.P. Borucki B. Otto H. Meyer T.E. Cusanovich M.A. Heyn M.P.

Although the signaling pathway of the PYP system has not yet been identified, detailed characterization of long lived intermediates (signaling state) is essential for understanding the signal transduction mechanism of PYP. We have demonstrated extensive conformational change upon formation of PYPM. The dimension of PYPM is significantly larger than the dark state as shown by ∼1 Å increase of Rg (20.Shimizu N. Kamikubo H. Mihara K. Imamoto Y. Kataoka M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 132: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 21.Imamoto Y. Kamikubo H. Harigai M. Shimizu N. Kataoka M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13595-13601Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and PYPM is in a partially unfolded state (22.Ohishi S. Shimizu N. Mihara K. Imamoto Y. Kataoka M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2854-2859Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The N-terminal cap and the central part undergo a substantial structural change (21.Imamoto Y. Kamikubo H. Harigai M. Shimizu N. Kataoka M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13595-13601Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 23.Harigai M. Imamoto Y. Kamikubo H. Yamazaki Y. Kataoka M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 13901-13908Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar); however, the cause of this large conformational change has not yet been determined. Accumulated evidence suggests that properties of PYPM are highly pH-sensitive. The extent of conformational change evaluated by the difference FTIR spectra under acidic conditions (24.Hoff W.D.

Hellingwerf K.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7902-7909Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) is significantly smaller than at neutral pH (15.Brudler R. Rammelsberg R. Woo T.T. Getzoff E.D. Gerwert K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 23.Harigai M. Imamoto Y. Kamikubo H. Yamazaki Y. Kataoka M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 13901-13908Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The decay rate constant of PYPM is reduced by acidification, and the relationship between rate constant and pH agrees with the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation with a pKa of 6.4 (26.Genick U.K. Devanathan S. Meyer T.E. Canestrelli I.L. Williams E. Cusanovich M.A. Tollin G. Getzoff E.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Proton uptake per PYPM formation is also represented by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation with a pKa of 6.6 (27.Hendriks J. Hoff W.D. Crielaard W. Hellingwerf K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17655-17660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). On the other hand, we have reported that PYPM substantially alters its nature, depending on the buffer system (20.Shimizu N. Kamikubo H. Mihara K. Imamoto Y. Kataoka M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 132: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Absorption spectra as well as the lifetime of PYPM at acidic pH are affected by multivalent organic ions, such as citrate. Mutation of amino acids nearby the chromophore also affects properties of PYPM. The absorption maximum of E46QM is 11-nm red-shifted (28.Imamoto Y. Mihara K. Tokunaga F. Kataoka M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14336-14343Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The protein conformational change for formation of E46QM is significantly smaller than wild type (16.Xie A. Kelemen L. Hendriks J. White B.J. Hellingwerf K.J. Hoff W.D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1510-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 29.Derix N.M. Wechselberger R.W. van der Horst M.A. Hellingwerf K.J. Boelens R. Kaptein R. van Nuland N.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14501-14506Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), suggesting that the photocycle of E46Q may be different from that of wild type. To study whether there is a simple and consistent explanation for the variety of signaling states or whether each phenomenon has an individual specific reason, the spectroscopic properties of PYPM were studied in detail under various conditions using UV-visible spectroscopy, CD spectroscopy, FTIR spectroscopy, and small angle x-ray scattering measurements. The results are explained by the equilibrium between two states of PYPM. Sample Preparation—Wild type PYP and E46Q were prepared as described previously (30.Mihara K. Hisatomi O. Imamoto Y. Kataoka M. Tokunaga F. J. Biochem. 1997; 121: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). For UV-visible and CD spectroscopy, PYP or mutant was suspended in 10 mm TAPS buffer (pH 8.5-8.0), 10 mm MOPS buffer (pH 8.0-6.5), or 10 mm MES buffer (pH 6.5-4.0) containing 200 mm NaCl (Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan). To investigate the effect of binding of citrate to PYPM, 50 mm (see Fig. 6) or 1 m (see Fig. 7) sodium citrate was added instead of NaCl (sample concentration ∼0.15 mg/ml). For SAXS measurements, samples at pH 5.0 and 8.0 were concentrated to 2-10 mg/ml with an ultrafiltration membrane (Centricon YM10, Millipore, Billerica, MA). For FTIR measurement, PYP and E46Q were desalted, lyophilized, and resuspended in 100 mm MES buffer (pH 5.0) or TAPS buffer (pH 8.0) containing 200 mm NaCl at a concentration of 150 mg/ml.FIGURE 7Shift of equilibrium by citrate. Dark state PYP in 1 m citrate buffer (base line) was excited by a yellow flash, then transient difference spectra were measured every 40 ms (pH 5.0, 5 °C). Inset, absorbance change at 383 nm was plotted against time after flash and fitted using an exponential curve (k = 0.003 s-1).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) UV-visible Spectroscopy—Absorption spectra in the dark and in the photosteady state were obtained by a multichannel CCD/fiber optic spectroscopy system (S2000 system, Ocean Optics, Dunedin, FL) (23.Harigai M. Imamoto Y. Kamikubo H. Yamazaki Y. Kataoka M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 13901-13908Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). For steady-state measurements, the sample was irradiated with a yellow light obtained from a 150-W cold light source (HL150, HOYA-Schott, Tokyo, Japan) and a Y43 cutoff filter (>410 nm, Asahi Techno Glass, Chiba, Japan). For time-resolved measurements, the sample was excited with a yellow flash obtained with a short arc xenon flash lamp (SA200, Nissin Electronic, Tokyo, Japan) and a Y43 filter. Absorption spectra of PYPM were calculated by subtracting dark spectra from photosteady state spectra (31.Imamoto Y. Harigai M. Kataoka M. FEBS Lett. 2004; 577: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). At pH > 6, contribution of the small amount of PYPL was also subtracted, as reported previously (31.Imamoto Y. Harigai M. Kataoka M. FEBS Lett. 2004; 577: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). CD Spectroscopy—Far-UV CD spectra of dark state and photosteady state were measured using a J-725 circular dichroism spectropolarimeter (JASCO, Tokyo, Japan). Temperature was maintained at 5 °C with a PYC-347WI Peltier device (JASCO). The sample cell, with a 1-mm light path length, was irradiated at an angle of 30° using a HOYA-Schott HL150 light source and an Y43 cutoff filter. To protect the detector, the band pass filter (214FS10-25, 210 nm < λ < 233 nm, Tmax = 14%, Andover Corporation, Salem, NH) was set in front of the detector window. It was confirmed that the artifact on CD signal caused by band-bass filter was negligible in this setup (23.Harigai M. Imamoto Y. Kamikubo H. Yamazaki Y. Kataoka M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 13901-13908Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The photosteady state mixture was composed of PYP, PYPL, and PYPM. The CD spectrum of PYPM was calculated assuming that the CD spectrum of PYPL is indistinguishable from that of PYP because FTIR measurements demonstrate that global structural change takes place at PYPM (32.Chen E. Gensch T. Gross A.B. Hendriks J. Hellingwerf K.J. Kliger D.S. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2062-2071Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The fraction of PYPM in the photosteady state mixture was estimated by absorption spectroscopy using an S2000 system under the same irradiation conditions as CD spectroscopy. FTIR Spectroscopy—Difference FTIR spectra between photosteady state and dark state were measured using an FTS6000 Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (23.Harigai M. Imamoto Y. Kamikubo H. Yamazaki Y. Kataoka M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 13901-13908Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The sample was put into a CaF2 cell with a 7.2 μm light path length (23.Harigai M. Imamoto Y. Kamikubo H. Yamazaki Y. Kataoka M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 13901-13908Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Irradiation light at 436 nm (FWHM = 10 nm) was obtained by an optical interference filter (43161, Edmund Scientific, Barrington, NJ) and a Hoya-Schott HL150 light source. SAXS Measurements—Small angle x-ray scattering measurements were carried out at BL-10C (Photon Factory, Tsukuba, Japan (20.Shimizu N. Kamikubo H. Mihara K. Imamoto Y. Kataoka M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 132: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 21.Imamoto Y. Kamikubo H. Harigai M. Shimizu N. Kataoka M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13595-13601Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar)). The exposure time was 5 min. Three to five sets of independent measurements were averaged to improve the signal to noise ratio. Temperature of the cell was maintained at 5 °C. Rg and I(0) were obtained by Guinier approximation in the small angle region (33.Guinier A. Fournet G. Small Angle X-ray Scattering. John-Wiley and Sons, New York1955Google Scholar, 34.Glatter O. Kratky O. Small Angle X-ray Scattering. Academic Press, New York1982Google Scholar), I(Q)≅I(0)exp(-13Q2Rg2) where Q = 4πsinθ/λ is the amplitude of the scattering vector, I(Q) is the scattering intensity at Q,2θ is the scattering angle, λ is the wavelength of the x-ray (1.488 Å), I(0) is the scattering intensity at Q = 0, and Rg is the radius of gyration. The sample was irradiated with yellow light obtained using a 1000-W tungsten-halogen lamp (HILUX-HR, Tokyo Master, Japan) and Y43 cutoff filter. The scattering profiles of photoproducts were calculated using scattering patterns of the photosteady state and dark state based on the fraction estimated by absorption spectroscopy. pH Titration—Absorbance at 395 nm (see Fig. 2c) or the ellipticity at 222 nm (see Fig. 3b) of PYPM was plotted against pH. Data were fitted according to Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, ΔAbs395nm,Δ[θ] 222nm=k0+k11+10pH-pKa (Eq. 2) where k0 and k1 are a base value and amplitude of the titration curve, respectively.FIGURE 3Secondary structural change of PYP at various pH values. a, far-UV CD spectra of the PYP dark state (dashed lines) at pH 5.0 and 8.0 and of PYPM (solid lines)atpH 5.0, 6.5, and 8.0. b, difference in molar ellipticity at 222 nm between PYP and PYPM at each pH was plotted against pH.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) pH-dependent Spectral Change of PYPM—Fig. 2a shows the absorption spectra of PYP suspended in the buffer at pH 4.0-8.5 in the dark. The absorption spectrum of PYP is independent of pH in this pH region, although it is bleached at pH < 4.1 (pKa = 3) (35.Meyer T.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 806: 175-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 36.Imamoto Y. Koshimizu H. Mihara K. Hisatomi O. Mizukami T. Tsujimoto K. Kataoka M. Tokunaga F. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4679-4685Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Then samples at various pH values were irradiated by continuous yellow light (>410 nm), and the absorption spectra of the photosteady state were recorded. As the photosteady state is in equilibrium between PYP, PYPL, and PYPM (31.Imamoto Y. Harigai M. Kataoka M. FEBS Lett. 2004; 577: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 37.Borucki B. Otto H. Joshi C.P. Gasperi C. Cusanovich M.A. Devanathan S. Tollin G. Heyn M.P. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8780-8790Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), the absorption spectrum of PYPM at each pH was calculated by subtracting the absorption spectra of dark state and PYPL from that of the photosteady state, so that the contributions of PYP and PYPL were cancelled (31.Imamoto Y. Harigai M. Kataoka M. FEBS Lett. 2004; 577: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Calculated absorption spectra of PYPM at pH 8.5-4.0 are shown in Fig. 2b. The PYPM spectrum at pH 8.5 had a broad shape with the shoulder at around 330 nm (λmax = 356 nm). Upon acidification, the spectrum was red-shifted (λmax = 367 nm), and the shoulder disappeared. The pH-dependent spectral change of PYPM at pH 8.5-4.0 is virtually a two-state transition with a clear isosbestic point at 362 nm. The absorbance change at 395 nm was plotted against pH (Fig. 2c). Absorbance at 395 nm was increased from pH 8.5 to 5.0, but decreased at pH < 5, suggesting that a part of PYPM is denatured at low pH. The absorbance change was fitted by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation (Equation 2). The pKa was estimated to be 6.4, which is close to that for the rate constant (6.4) (26.Genick U.K. Devanathan S. Meyer T.E. Canestrelli I.L. Williams E. Cusanovich M.A. Tollin G. Getzoff E.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) or proton uptake (6.6) (27.Hendriks J. Hoff W.D. Crielaard W. Hellingwerf K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17655-17660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The two states of PYPM observed at pH 8.5 and at pH 5.0 are hereafter called PYPMalkali PYPMacid, respectively. Comparison of Secondary Structure Using CD Spectroscopy—Differences in the secondary structure between PYPMalkali and PYPMacid were evaluated using CD spectra in the far-UV region. The CD spectra of PYP at pH 8.0 and 5.0 agreed with each other in the dark state (Fig. 3a, dashed lines), indicating that the secondary structure of the dark state PYP is pH-independent in this pH region. The CD spectra of the photosteady state were then measured, and pure CD spectra of PYPM were calculated using the fraction of the dark state PYP estimated by absorption spectroscopy under the same irradiation conditions. Typical CD spectra for PYPM at pH values 8.0, 6.5, and 5.0 are shown in Fig. 3a. The significant difference indicates that the secondary structure of PYPMalkali is different from that of PYPMacid. The spectrum at pH 6.5 is in between those at pH 8.0 and 5.0, indicating that it is a 1:1 mixture of PYPMacid and PYPMalkali. The loss of ellipticity at 222 nm using light is 36% for PYPMalkali (pH 8.0) and 9% for PYPMacid (pH 5.0). In Fig. 3b, the light-induced ellipticity change at 222 nm (Δ[θ]222 nm) is plotted against pH. From pH 8.5 to 5.0, Δ[θ]222 nm gradually decreased, indicating that the loss of secondary structure is reduced. However, it increased at pH < 5, as demonstrated by the absorption spectroscopy (Fig. 2c), also indicating partial denaturation of PYPM. The apparent pKa for the ellipticity change was 6.4, which agrees with the change in the absorption spectrum. Thus changes in the absorption spectrum of PYPM correspond well with the secondary structural change. Figs. 2c and 3b show that the fraction of PYPMacid is maximal at pH 5.0, and the equilibration shift is almost saturated at pH 8.0. PYPMacid and PYPMalkali were further characterized using PYP solutions at pH 5.0 and pH 8.0, respectively. Comparison of Secondary Structure Using FTIR Spectroscopy—The difference between PYPMacid and PYPMalkali was studied by FTIR spectroscopy using PYP solution at pH 5.0 or pH 8.0. Spectra were measured in the dark and under continuous illumination, then difference FTIR spectra between photosteady state and dark state were calculated. Vibrational bands between 1500 and 900 cm-1, where chromophore bands appear, were insensitive to pH for the dark state (negative bands); however, the positive bands at 1004 and 1193 cm-1 for PYPMalkali were slightly down-shifted in PYPMacid. This demonstrates a structural difference in the chromophore between PYPMacid and PYPMalkali that would cause an 11-nm difference in the absorption maximum, whereas changes in the protein environment may also contribute. Global conformational change induced by light is evaluated by the absorbance change in the amide I (∼1650 cm-1) and amide II (∼1550 cm-1) mode regions. The negative band at 1646 cm-1 at pH 8.0 was reduced and split into two bands at 1644 and 1658 cm-1 at pH 5.0. Second derivative spectra (Fig. 4b) show that a 1646 cm-1 band at pH 8.0 is composed of 1658, 1645, and 1635 cm-1 bands, with the 1645 cm-1 band being the largest of them. At pH 5.0, part of the 1645 cm-1 mode was shifted to 1658 cm-1, resulting in a split peak. A similar shift was observed in N terminus-truncated PYP (23.Harigai M. Imamoto Y. Kamikubo H. Yamazaki Y. Kataoka M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 13901-13908Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). FTIR spectra and their second derivative spectra clearly show that the 1529 cm-1 band, a typical amide II mode of a β-structure, was reduced by acidification. Together with the CD spectra results, structural change of both α-helices and β-sheets at pH 5.0 is smaller than at pH 8.0. It should be noted that the positive 1747 cm-1 band, which indicates protonation of Glu-46, is observed for PYPMacid. The shoulder of this band suggests that Glu-46 is flexible and in two states in PYPMacid. As the peak area of the negative band at 1736 cm-1 is 5.3 times larger than that of the positive band at 1747 cm-1, it is likely that Glu-46 is partially protonated in PYPMacid. Solution Structure of PYPMacid and PYPMalkali—The tertiary structures of PYPMalkali and PYPMacid were characterized by small angle x-ray scattering measurements. The scattering profile was measured in the dark and under illumination at pH 8.0 and 5.0. The scattering profiles for PYPM in each preparation (2-10 mg/ml) at pH 8.0 and 5.0 were calculated by subtracting scattering profiles of the dark state from that of the photosteady state, in which the amount of dark state was estimated by UV-visible spectroscopy. Fig. 5 shows Guinier plots (ln I(Q) versus Q2) for dark state PYP at pH 5.0 (a) and 8.0 (b), plus PYPMacid (a) and PYPMalkali (b). All Guinier plots were fitted in the linear region (Q2 < 0.022), and the square of radius of gyration (Rg2) was obtained from the slope. In all samples, illumination of PYP made the slope of Guinier plots steeper, indicating that Rg is increased upon PYPM formation. However, the increase in the slope for PYPMalkali (Fig. 5b) was clearly larger than for PYPMacid (Fig. 5a). Rg2 values estimated at various concentrations were plotted against concentration (Fig. 5c), and the intrinsic values of Rg2 were obtained by extrapolation to a concentration of zero. Rg values thus obtained are shown in Table 1.TABLE 1The radius of gyration (Å) of dark state PYP and photoproductpH 2.0pH 5.0pH 8.0Dark15.9 ± 0.2aBleached15.2 ± 0.215.2 ± 0.1Light16.1 ± 0.215.7 ± 0.216.2 ± 0.1a Bleached Open table in a new tab At both pH values, y intersections of Guinier plots were not altered by illumination (Fig. 5, a and b), indicating that neither aggregation nor binding of solute ions to PYPM (20.Shimizu N.

Therefore, the difference in Rg between the samples at pH 8.0 and pH 5.0 simply reflects the difference in the structure between PYPMacid and PYPMalkali. Rg for PYPMalkali (16.2 ± 0.1 Å) was significantly larger than that for PYPMacid (15.7 ± 0.2 Å), indicating that PYPMalkali is swollen compared with the PYPMacid. Shift in Equilibrium by Citrate—Multivalent organic anions such as citrate bind to PYPM and stabilize it (20.Shimizu N. Kamikubo H. Mihara K. Imamoto Y. Kataoka M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 132: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Here the effect of citrate on equilibrium of PYPM was investigated. PYPM spectra at pH 8.0 and 5.0 in the presence of 50"
https://openalex.org/W1977889268,"Genetically encoded Ca2+ indicators are outstanding tools for the assessment of intracellular/organelle Ca2+ dynamics. Basically, most indicators contain the Ca2+-binding site of a (mutated) cytosolic protein that interacts with its natural (mutated) interaction partner upon binding of Ca2+. Consequently, a change in the structure of the sensor occurs that, in turn, alters the fluorescent properties of the sensor. Herein, we present a new type of genetically encoded Ca2+ indicator for the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (apoK1-er (W. F. Graier, K. Osibow, R. Malli, and G. M. Kostner, patent application number 05450006.1 at the European patent office)) that is based on a single kringle domain from apolipoprotein(a), which is flanked by yellow and cyan fluorescent protein at the 3'- and 5'-ends, respectively. Notably, apoK1-er does not interact with Ca2+ itself but serves as a substrate for calreticulin, the main constitutive Ca2+-binding protein in the ER. ApoK1-er assembles with calreticulin and the protein disulfide isomerase ERp57 and undergoes a conformational shift in a Ca2+-dependent manner that allows fluorescence resonance energy transfer between the two fluorophores. This construct primarily offers three major advantages compared with the already existing probes: (i) it resolves perfectly the physiological range of the free Ca2+ concentration in the ER, (ii) expression of apoK1-er does not affect the Ca2+ buffering capacity of the ER, and (iii) apoK1-er is not inactivated by binding of constitutive interaction partners that prevent Ca2+-dependent conformational changes. These unique characteristics of apoK1-er make this sensor particularly attractive for studies on ER Ca2+ signaling and dynamics in which alteration of Ca2+ fluctuations by expression of any additional Ca2+ buffer essentially has to be avoided."

Using the HXT2 and HXT4 genes, we now present evidence for a functional link between Snf1p-dependent activation, recruitment of the SAGA complex, histone H3 removal, and H3 acetylation. Recruitment of the SAGA complex is dependent on the release of Ssn6p-Tup1p repression by Snf1p. In addition, we found that the Gcn5p subunit of the SAGA complex preferentially acetylates histone H3K18 on the HXT2 and HXT4 promoters and that Gcn5p activity is required for removal of histone H3 from the HXT4 promoter TATA region. In contrast, histone H3 removal from the HXT2 promoter does not require Gcn5p. In conclusion, although similar protein complexes are involved, induction of HXT2 and HXT4 displays important mechanistic differences.

The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae utilizes glucose fermentation to generate metabolic energy. To optimize this process, glucose concentrations are carefully monitored, and gene expression is tightly linked to glucose availability. When glucose is present, genes involved in the uptake and fermentation of glucose are actively transcribed. However, glucose can also mediate repressive signals for genes involved in processing non-fermentable carbon sources and genes involved in the uptake and processing of alternative carbon sources. This latter process is known as glucose repression (1.Carlson M. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 202-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 2.Rolland F. Winderickx J. Thevelein J.M. FEMS Yeast Res. 2002; 2: 183-201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A central component in the glucose repression pathway is the Tup1p-Ssn6p complex. The Ssn6p-Tup1p complex has no DNA binding activity and depends on sequence-specific factors such as Mig1p for association to its target promoters (3.Treitel M.A. Carlson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3132-3136Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 4.Smith R.L. Johnson A.D. Trends Biochem.

Moreover, deletion of either SSN6 or TUP1 results in an altered chromatin organization of RNR3, FLO1, SUC2, and a-cell-specific genes (10.Cooper J.P. Roth S.Y. Simpson R.T. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1400-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 11.Gavin I.M. Simpson R.T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6263-6271Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 12.Ducker C.E. Simpson R.T.

A direct molecular link between Tup1p and chromatin organization was suggested by the interaction of the Tup1p repression domain with the N-terminal tails of histone H3 and H4 (15.Edmondson D.G. Smith M.M. Roth S.Y. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1247-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). In addition, Tup1p preferentially binds hypoacetylated histones on a subset of genes in vivo (16.Davie J.K. Trumbly R.J. Dent S.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 693-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 17.Bone J.R. Roth S.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1808-1813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To ensure efficient influx of glucose, yeast cells can express different hexose transporter (HXT) genes. The HXT2 and HXT4 genes encode high affinity glucose transporters, whose expression is repressed by high levels of glucose (18.Ozcan S. Johnston M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1564-1572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Repression of the HXT2 and HXT4 genes is mediated by both subunits of the Ssn6p-Tup1p complex, because deletion of either SSN6 or TUP1 results in promoter activation of these genes under non-inducing conditions (18.Ozcan S. Johnston M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1564-1572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Ozcan S. Johnston M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5536-5545Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). To release Ssn6p-Tup1p-mediated repression under inducing conditions (i.e. low glucose), the HXT2 and HXT4 genes require Snf1p function (18.Ozcan S. Johnston M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1564-1572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Snf1p encodes a serine/threonine kinase and is required for the expression of glucose-repressed genes (20.Celenza J.L. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 21.Celenza J.L. Carlson M. Science. 1986; 233: 1175-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Snf1p kinase phosphorylates Mig1p, which results in a functional disruption of the Mig1p-Ssn6p interaction on repressed genes (22.Treitel M.A. Kuchin S. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6273-6280Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 23.Ozcan S. Johnston M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 554-569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Papamichos-Chronakis M. Gligoris T. Tzamarias D. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 368-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Snf1p has also been reported to phosphorylate serine 10 of histone H3 (H3S10), which is important for SAGA recruitment to the INO1 promoter (25.Lo W.S. Gamache E.R. Henry K.W. Yang D. Pillus L. Berger S.L. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 997-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The SAGA complex is a multisubunit complex with distinct transcriptional activities (26.Grant P.A. Sterner D.E. Duggan L.J. Workman J.L. Berger S.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 193-197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 27.Timmers H.T. Tora L. Trends Biochem.

The Spt3p and Spt8p proteins regulate TBP activity, whereas the Gcn5p subunit has histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity (28.Eisenmann D.M. Arndt K.M. Ricupero S.L. Rooney J.W. Winston F.

Furthermore, subunits, including Spt7p and Spt20p, comprise the structural backbone of the SAGA complex supporting the Spt3p-Spt8p-TBP and Gcn5p-HAT modules (30.Sterner D.E. Grant P.A. Roberts S.M.

Ruhlmann C. Winston F. Schultz P. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 199-208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The SAGA complex is specifically recruited via its Tra1p subunit by activators like Gal4p and Gcn4p (34.Brown C.E. Howe L. Sousa K. Alley S.C. Carrozza M.J. Tan S. Workman J.L. Science. 2001; 292: 2333-2337Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). SAGA is essential for the Spt3p-dependent TBP recruitment to the TATA box region of the GAL1 promoter (35.Dudley A.M. Rougeulle C. Winston F. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2940-2945Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 36.Bhaumik S.R. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1935-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 37.Larschan E. Winston F. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1946-1956Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). In addition, Spt3p and Gcn5p were shown to recruit Mot1p to the GAL1 gene and to play a role in nucleosomal arrangement of the GAL1 promoter after activation (38.Topalidou I. Papamichos-Chronakis M. Thireos G. Tzamarias D. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1943-1948Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, deletion of GCN5 only has a mild effect on GAL1 transcription (35.Dudley A.M. Rougeulle C. Winston F. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2940-2945Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 36.Bhaumik S.R. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1935-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, SAGA recruitment to the GAL1 gene involves Cti6p, a protein that physically bridges Ssn6p to the SAGA complex (39.Papamichos-Chronakis M. Petrakis T. Ktistaki E. Topalidou I. Tzamarias D. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1297-1305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We have shown recently that SAGA is specifically recruited to the upstream regions of the HXT2 and HXT4 genes (40.van Oevelen C.J. van Teeffelen H.A. Timmers H.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 4863-4872Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Although the SAGA complex is required for the recruitment of both Mot1p and the TFIID subunit, Taf1p, to the TATA box regions via different modules, SAGA is only essential for HXT4 expression (40.van Oevelen C.J. van Teeffelen H.A. Timmers H.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 4863-4872Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Here, we describe a functional link between release of repression by Snf1p, SAGA recruitment, and its consequences for chromatin regulation of the HXT2 and HXT4 promoters. Acetylation of histone H3 depends on the HAT activity of Gcn5p but does not play a role in transcription activation. Together, these experiments show a novel relation between Snf1p-dependent activation, release of Ssn6p-Tup1p repression, SAGA recruitment, and chromatin regulation on the HXT2 and HXT4 genes.

Previously, it was shown that deletion of components of the repression complex (i.e. MIG1, RGT1, SSN6, and TUP1) leads to (partial) derepression of the HXT2 and HXT4 promoters depending on the growth conditions (18.Ozcan S. Johnston M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1564-1572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Ozcan S. Johnston M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5536-5545Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In contrast, deletion of the SNF1 gene completely abolishes HXT2 and HXT4 induction under conditions of low glucose (18.Ozcan S. Johnston M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1564-1572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In these experiments HXT2 and HXT4 promoter activity was measured in a plasmid-based system using the LacZ reporter gene. To study the early kinetics of HXT2 and HXT4 mRNA induction we have developed a rapid cell harvesting protocol (40.van Oevelen C.J. van Teeffelen H.A. Timmers H.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 4863-4872Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Using this method, we studied the kinetics of mRNA induction from the endogenous HXT2 and HXT4 genes in repression and derepression mutant strains (Table 1). To analyze variations in mRNA loading, HXT2 and HXT4 mRNA were quantified relative to ACT1 mRNA levels (Fig. 1, C and D), which is invariant during the glucose concentration shift (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 1 and as previously described (40.van Oevelen C.J. van Teeffelen H.A. Timmers H.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 4863-4872Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), a 20- to 25-fold induction of HXT2 and HXT4 mRNA was observed, which occurred already 5 min after a shift to low glucose. Deletion of SNF1 completely abolished induction of HXT2 and HXT4 mRNA, which is in agreement with previous results (18.Ozcan S. Johnston M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1564-1572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mig1p and Rgt1p are repressors recruiting the Ssn6p-Tup1p complex to glucose-repressed genes (1.Carlson M. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 202-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Mutant cells deleted for either MIG1 or RGT1 displayed a 3- to 5-fold increase of basal levels compared with wild-type cells (Fig. 1). Nevertheless, shifting to low glucose still resulted in mRNA induction of HXT2 and HXT4 to levels, which slightly exceeded wild-type levels. In contrast, deletion of TUP1 resulted in (an almost complete) derepression and deletion of SSN6 completely derepressed HXT2 and HXT4 transcription under non-inducing conditions. Thus, the Ssn6p-Tup1p complex represses mRNA expression of the HXT2 and HXT4 genes under non-inducing conditions and relief of repression requires Snf1p as has been described previously (18.Ozcan S. Johnston M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1564-1572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Ozcan S. Johnston M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5536-5545Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The results also suggest that both Mig1p and Rgt1p can recruit the Ssn6p-Tup1p complex to the HXT2 and HXT4 promoters. A Decrease in Tup1p Binding Precedes Decreased Histone H3 Binding and Preinitiation Complex Formation—The Ssn6p-Tup1p repressor complex is recruited by Mig1p to several glucose-repressed genes such as CYC1 and GAL1 (3.Treitel M.A. Carlson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3132-3136Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 24.Papamichos-Chronakis M. Gligoris T. Tzamarias D. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 368-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 48.Tzamarias D. Struhl K. Nature. 1994; 369: 758-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Furthermore, deletion of either component of the Ssn6p-Tup1p complex resulted in a constitutive expression of the HXT2 and HXT4 genes (Fig. 1). Therefore, to investigate the direct association of the Ssn6p-Tup1p complex to the HXT2 and HXT4 promoters, we determined the binding kinetics of Tup1p during a shift to low glucose. This was investigated by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays employing yeast cells expressing a hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged version of Tup1p (see Table 1). Cells were grown in SC medium containing 4% glucose and shifted to 0.1% glucose. Subsequently, formaldehyde-cross-linked chromatin was isolated at various times after the glucose shift. Immunopurified DNA was analyzed by real-time PCR using primer sets, which amplify the TATA or upstream regions of the HXT2 and HXT4 genes (Fig. 2A). An intragenic fragment of the POL1 gene was used as a normalization control (49.Kuras L. Struhl K. Nature. 1999; 399: 609-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). When cells were grown in 4% glucose we observed strong and specific binding of Tup1p to the putative UAS regions of the HXT2 and HXT4 promoters, which was 35- to 40-fold above the POL1 background signal (Fig. 2B). Directly after cells were shifted to low glucose, Tup1p binding was slightly decreased (less than 2-fold) at the putative UAS of HXT2 and HXT4. Association of Tup1 with the flanking regions was lower, and activation did not reduce this association. Tup1p has been reported to bind to the N-terminal tails of histone H3 and H4, and Tup1p binding correlates with hypoacetylated histone H3 on the STE2 and STE6 promoters in vivo (15.Edmondson D.G. Smith M.M. Roth S.Y. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1247-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 16.Davie J.K. Trumbly R.J. Dent S.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 693-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Therefore we analyzed the binding of histone H3 to the HXT2 and HXT4 promoters by using an antibody directed against the C-terminal 12 residues of H3. Under levels of high glucose, we observed histone H3 binding to the UAS and TATA regions of the HXT2 and HXT4 promoters. Shifting cells to low glucose resulted in a 3- to 8-fold decrease in histone H3 binding to both UAS and TATA regions with minimal binding after 2–5 min (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, H3 binding inversely correlated with TBP and polymerase II binding, which is at maximum levels 2–5 min after the glucose shift (Fig. 2D) as we observed previously (40.van Oevelen C.J. van Teeffelen H.A. Timmers H.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 4863-4872Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 46.Andrau J.-C. van Oevelen C.J.C. van Teeffelen H.A.A.M. Weil P.A. Holstege F.C.P. Timmers H.T.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5173-5183Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Thus, after a shift to low glucose the small decrease in Tup1p association precedes a strong decrease in histone H3 binding and increases in TBP and polymerase II association. HXT2 and HXT4 Promoters Are Preferentially Acetylated at Histone H3K18 after Activation—A correlation between Tup1p association and histone H3 acetylation was reported for the STE2, RNR3, and SUC2 genes (16.Davie J.K. Trumbly R.J. Dent S.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 693-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 17.Bone J.R. Roth S.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1808-1813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In these cases, deletion of TUP1 leads to an increase in acetylated histone H3 on these promoters. Therefore, we tested whether a decrease in Tup1p binding correlated with an increase in acetylated histone H3 on the HXT genes. Cross-linked chromatin was subjected to immunoprecipitations using specific antibodies directed against individual acetylated lysine residues of histone H3. We observed a strong increase in H3K18Ac relative to a control region of the POL1 open reading frame (46.Andrau J.-C. van Oevelen C.J.C. van Teeffelen H.A.A.M. Weil P.A. Holstege F.C.P. Timmers H.T.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5173-5183Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 50.Kuras L. Kosa P. Mencia M. Struhl K. Science. 2000; 288: 1244-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) on both HXT2 and HXT4 promoters after a shift to low glucose (Fig. 3A). In contrast, we did not detect changes in H3K14Ac levels (Fig. 3B) and only a 2-fold increase in H3K9Ac levels (supplementary Fig. S1). However, when compared with the total amount of histone H3 on the HXT2 and HXT4 promoters, H3K14Ac (and H3K9Ac) increased after the glucose shift (Fig. 3, C and D). In addition, normalization to total histone H3 levels further confirms that the HXT2 and HXT4 promoters are preferentially acetylated on H3K18 (Fig. 3, C and D). Thus, analysis of the modification status of histone H3 reveals a specific histone H3 acetylation pattern on the HXT2 and HXT4 prom"

They alter DNA topology by cleaving and resealing one strand of duplex DNA via a covalent DNA-(3-phosphotyrosyl)-enzyme intermediate. Bacterial type IB enzymes were discovered recently and are described as poxvirus-like with respect to their small size, primary structures, and bipartite domain organization. Here we report the 1.75-Å crystal structure of Deinococcus radiodurans topoisomerase IB (DraTopIB), a prototype of the bacterial clade. DraTopIB consists of an amino-terminal (N) β-sheet domain (amino acids 1–90) and a predominantly α-helical carboxyl-terminal (C) domain (amino acids 91–346) that closely resemble the corresponding domains of vaccinia virus topoisomerase IB. The five amino acids of DraTopIB that comprise the catalytic pentad (Arg-137, Lys-174, Arg-239, Asn-280, and Tyr-289) are preassembled into the active site in the absence of DNA in a manner nearly identical to the pentad configuration in human topoisomerase I bound to DNA. This contrasts with the apoenzyme of vaccinia topoisomerase, in which three of the active site constituents are either displaced or disordered. The N and C domains of DraTopIB are splayed apart in an “open” conformation, in which the surface of the catalytic domain containing the active site is exposed for DNA binding. A comparison with the human topoisomerase I-DNA cocrystal structure suggests how viral and bacterial topoisomerase IB enzymes might bind DNA circumferentially via movement of the N domain into the major groove and clamping of a disordered loop of the C domain around the helix.

Topoisomerases I and II are involved in virtually all DNA transactions and are the targets of clinically effective anti-cancer and anti-infective drugs (1Champoux J.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 369-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (2218) Google Scholar, 2Corbett K.D. Berger J.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2004; 33: 95-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Topoisomerases exploit a tyrosine nucleophile to attack the phosphodiester backbone, yielding a covalent enzyme-DNA adduct on one side of the resulting break that permits the passage of strand(s) through the break. Type I enzymes operate by cleaving one DNA strand and passing another strand through the nick; type II enzymes cleave both DNA strands and allow passage of a duplex segment through the double strand break. Closure of the break by reversal of the cleavage step results in a change to the topology of DNA, with no net effect on its chemical structure. Type I topoisomerases are subclassified as type IA or type IB enzymes, depending on whether they form a 5′- or 3′-phosphotyrosyl adduct, respectively. Type IA enzymes are distributed widely in the bacterial, archaeal, and eukaryal domains of life. Type IB enzymes are found in eukarya, eukaryotic viruses (poxviruses and mimivirus), and many genera of bacteria (1Champoux J.J. Annu. Rev.

Eukaryotic nuclear type IB enzymes are large monomeric polypeptides, typically >90 kDa, whereas the viral and bacterial type IB polypeptides are much smaller, typically ∼33–36 kDa. Despite their differences in size, the poxvirus and nuclear type IB enzymes have a common core tertiary structure and catalytic mechanism (7Cheng C. Kussie P. Pavletich N. Shuman S.

The atomic structures of the individual domains of vaccinia TopIB have been determined by x-ray crystallography (7Cheng C. Kussie P. Pavletich N. Shuman S.

Whereas the fold and active site of the predominantly α-helical catalytic domain are conserved in nuclear type IB topoisomerases (nuclear TopIB) and the tyrosine recombinases (7Cheng C. Kussie P.

Hanai R. Mondragón A.

Champoux J.J. Hol W.G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Bacterial type IB topoisomerases were discovered recently (5Krogh B.O. Shuman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1853-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and are similar to poxvirus type IB topoisomerases with respect to their size, primary structures, and domain organization (Fig. 1). Mutational analyses indicate that the transesterification mechanism and active site constituents of bacterial TopIB adhere closely to those of vaccinia TopIB (5Krogh B.O. Shuman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1853-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). A major difference between the viral and bacterial enzymes is their cleavage site specificity. Whereas poxvirus and mimivirus TopIB transesterify at a pentapyrimidine cleavage site 5′-(C/T)CCTT↓ in duplex DNA (6Benarroch D. Claverie J.M. Raoult D. Shuman S. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 314-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 28Shuman S. Prescott J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17826-17836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the same element cannot be cleaved by Deinococcus radiodurans topoisomerase IB (DraTopIB), the only member of the bacterial TopIB clade that has been characterized to date (5Krogh B.O.

Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15984-15992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been proposed that contacts of the poxvirus TopIB with DNA trigger assembly of a competent active site by recruitment of several of the catalytic residues that are either disordered or out of position in the free enzyme (7Cheng C. Kussie P. Pavletich N. Shuman S. Cell. 1998; 92: 841-850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 30Krogh B.O. Shuman S. J. Biol.

Structural studies of tyrosine recombinases underscore the theme that the active site might not be preassembled in the free enzyme prior to productive DNA binding (11Kwon H.J. Tirumalai R. Landy A. Ellenberger T. Science. 1997; 276: 126-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 12Subramanya H.S. Arciszewska L.K. Baker R.A. Bird L.E. Sherratt D.J. Wigley D.B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5178-5187Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). A fuller understanding of target site recognition by type IB enzymes and the conformational changes that accompany DNA binding will depend on capturing the structures of a single enzyme in free and DNA-bound states or on structural comparisons of enzymes with different site specificity in the same functional states along the reaction pathway. These goals have been elusive. The structures of a free full-length poxvirus or nuclear TopIB remain unsolved, perhaps because domain motions about the linker are an impediment to crystallization. Whereas the human TopIB has been crystallized bound to DNA (8Redinbo M.R. Stewart L. Kuhn P. Champoux J.J. Hol W.G. Science. 1998; 279: 1504-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar), no DNA cocrystal has been obtained for the vaccinia enzyme. Here we report the structure of the intact D. radiodurans topoisomerase IB, a prototypal bacterial type IB topoisomerase. The structure verifies the predicted similarity between viral, nuclear, and bacterial type IB enzymes. Important findings are: (i) the active site of DraTopIB is substantially preassembled and seemingly poised for transesterification and (ii) the relative orientation of the catalytic and amino-terminal domains in the apoenzyme clearly needs to change to engage duplex DNA in the circumferential binding mode used by viral and nuclear enzymes (7Cheng C. Kussie P. Pavletich N. Shuman S. Cell. 1998; 92: 841-850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 8Redinbo M.R. Stewart L. Kuhn P. Champoux J.J. Hol W.G.

A comparison with the human TopIB-DNA cocrystal structure suggests how viral and bacterial TopIB enzymes might bind circumferentially to DNA. DraTopIB Purification and Crystallization—DraTopIB was produced and purified as described previously (5Krogh B.O. Shuman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1853-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Selenomethionine-substituted protein was produced using the methionine pathway inhibition method (34Van Duyne G.D. Standaert R.F. Karplus P.A. Schreiber S.L. Clardy J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 105-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar). For crystallization, the protein was further purified by hydrophobic (Tosoh Biosep; TSK-Gel Phenyl-5PW) and gel filtration chromatography (Pharmacia Corporation; Sephacryl S-100). Purified protein was dialyzed into 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, and concentrated to 5 mg/ml. Initial crystallization trials, using 96-well crystallization plates set up with a Hydra-II crystallization robot, gave small plate-like crystals in a variety of polyethylene glycol conditions at 10 °C, which were refined further. Refined conditions yielded plate-like crystals in 12% polyethylene glycol 3350 (w/v), 0.1 m MES (pH 6.5), 0.2 m ammonium chloride using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. Typical crystals were .4×.4×.05 mm. Prior to data collection, DraTopIB crystals were transferred to a solution containing 25% glycerol in addition to the mother liquor in several steps (5% glycerol increments/step and soaking for 2 min/step), harvested using a rayon crystal-mounting loop, and flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. Throughout the transfer, the crystals were kept at 4 °C. Structure Determination and Refinement—All data were collected from a single crystal at 100 K using synchrotron radiation at the DuPont-Northwestern-Dow Collaborative Access Team Synchrotron Research Center at the Advanced Photon Source. Diffraction data were measured at a wavelength corresponding to an energy value of ∼35 eV above the theoretical absorption edge of selenium (E = 12,693 eV, λ = 0.9768 Å). To minimize radiation damage, the crystal was translated halfway through data collection. In addition, a low resolution data set was collected from the same crystal after the high resolution data had been measured. All data were processed using XDS (35Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3243) Google Scholar) and scaled using SCALA software programs (36Collaborative Computational Project 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). DraTopIB crystals belong to space group P21 with unit cell dimensions a = 38.09, b = 64.97, and c = 76.62 Å, β = 91.78° and have one molecule in the asymmetric unit.

Open table in a new tab Three of five possible selenium sites were identified using the Shake and Bake program (37Weeks C.M. DeTitta G.T. Hauptman H.A. Thuman P. Miller R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 472-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar). The missing fifth site corresponds to the disordered amino-terminal methionine. The four selenium sites were refined and phases to 1.75 Å were calculated using SHARP. Phases were improved by density modification using Solomon (40Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1996; 52: 30-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar) and DM programs (41Cowtan K. Joint CCP4 and ESF-EACBM Newsletter on Protein Crystallography, Vol. 31. Daresbury Laboratory, Daresbury, UK1994: 34-38Google Scholar) as implemented in SHARP. The resulting electron density map clearly showed elements of protein secondary structure. Experimental density for the active site region is shown in Fig. 2. The high quality of the experimental map enabled the use of ARP/warp programs (42Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2565) Google Scholar) to trace automatically 253 of 346 amino acids in the polypeptide chain mainly corresponding to the C domain, which is better ordered. Additional model building was carried out in the program O (43Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). The model was refined with the REFMAC5 program (44Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar) using data to 1.75 Å resolution. The program ARP was used to place water molecules into peaks >1.5σ in a 2Fo - Fc difference Fourier map and within hydrogen bonding distances. No electron density was seen for several loops in the N domain and one loop in the C domain. As part of the refinement, the translation/liberation/screw parameters were refined for each domain. The final model contained residues 2–16, 20–24, 39–138, and 149–337 plus 321 water molecules and 1 unidentified atom. The model also included 12 amino acids showing alternative side chain conformations. All residues were found within the most favored or allowed regions in the Ramachandran plot. Refinement statistics are listed in Table 1. Figures were made with the programs MOLSCRIPT (45Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar), RASTER3D (46Merritt E.A. Murphy M.E.P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; D50: 869-873Crossref Scopus (2859) Google Scholar), and PYMOL (47DeLano W.L. The PyMOL User's Manual. DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA2002Google Scholar). Coordinates and structure factors for DraTopIB have been deposited in the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics Protein Data Bank under the accession code 2F4Q. Overview of the DraTopIB Structure—The structure of DraTopIB was determined by Single Anomalous Dispersion phasing as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The final model, containing one DraTopIB protomer in the asymmetric unit, was refined at 1.75 Å resolution (Rfree = 23.2% and r = 19.7%; Table 1). DraTopIB is composed of an N domain spanning aa 1–90 and a C domain from aa 91–346. Most of the amino acids in the C domain were clearly visible in the electron density map (e.g. see Fig. 2), except for a disordered loop from residues 139–148. The density in the N domain was of poorer quality, with several disordered loops and missing side chains, especially near the amino terminus. The N domain (Fig. 1, red) comprises three α helices plus a five strand antiparallel β-sheet in a tertiary structure similar to that of the N domain of vaccinia TopIB (22Sharma A. Hanai R. Mondragón A. Structure (Lond.). 1994; 2: 767-777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The first helix, α0N, which has no equivalent in vaccinia TopIB, packs against the C domain. The structure of the C domain, which contains the active site, is similar to the catalytic domain of vaccinia TopIB (7Cheng C. Kussie P. Pavletich N. Shuman S. Cell. 1998; 92: 841-850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). It can be described as a two-lobed fold. Lobe 1 (Fig. 1, cyan) comprises residues 115–233 and contains four helices plus two β-sheets; one sheet is formed by three anti-parallel strands (β1-β3) and the second by two anti-parallel strands (β4-β5). Lobe 2 (Fig. 1, blue) comprises eight α helices (α1 and α6–10) formed by residues 91–113 and 234–346. The last nine amino acids of the protein are part of lobe 2 but are not visible in the crystal structure. The two lobes make extensive interactions, and the active site residues are located at the interface between the lobes. Similarity to Viral TopIB—A search of the Protein Data Bank using the DALI server (48Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3566) Google Scholar) and the Structural Classification of Proteins data base (49Murzin A.G. Brenner S.E. Hubbard T. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 536-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (5610) Google Scholar) using secondary structure matching (50Krissinel E. Henrick K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2004; 60: 2256-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (3189) Google Scholar) confirmed that the C domain of DraTopIB is structurally similar to the catalytic domains of vaccinia TopIB, human TopIB, and several tyrosine recombinases, thereby supporting the proposed common ancestry of the TopIB and tyrosine recombinase enzymes (5Krogh B.O. Shuman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1853-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 7Cheng C. Kussie P. Pavletich N. Shuman S. Cell. 1998; 92: 841-850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The search also highlighted the similarity of the N domains of DraTopIB and vaccinia TopIB; otherwise, no significant similarities to any other protein or class of proteins were uncovered. The N domains of DraTopIB and vaccinia TopIB are superimposable with an r.m.s.d. of 1.05 Å for 42 Cα atoms; the C domains superposed with an r.m.s.d. of 3.0 Å for 132 Cα atoms (Fig. 3A). Considered individually, lobes 1 and 2 of DraTopIB superposed on lobes 1 and 2 of vaccinia TopIB with r.m.s.d. values of 2.05 Å and 2.35 Å for 82 and 52 Cα atoms, respectively. The secondary structure elements of lobe 1 aligned well, except for the presence of a surface β-sheet inserted between helices α4 and α5 of DraTopIB (aa 204–216) (Fig. 1). A disordered surface loop in DraTopIB (aa 139–148) corresponds closely to a disordered segment in vaccinia TopIB (aa 129–136), with an important difference being that there is well defined electron density for the first essential arginine of the catalytic pentad (Arg-137) in DraTopIB immediately preceding the start of the disordered loop, whereas the equivalent Arg-130 side chain of vaccinia TopIB is part of the missing segment (Fig. 1). Lobe 2 of vaccinia and DraTopIB differ significantly with respect to their secondary structures flanking the tyrosine nucleophile of the active site. Whereas Tyr-274 of vaccinia TopIB is located within a long continuous helix (helix α8 from aa 269–283), the corresponding region of DraTopIB is broken into two shorter helices (α8′ and α8″), such that the Tyr-289 nucleophile is now situated in the loop connecting the short helices (Figs. 1 and 3C). This has the effect of changing dramatically the position of the catalytic tyrosine, as discussed under “A Preassembled Active Site in DraTopIB.” The structures of vaccinia and DraTopIB also differ in the positioning of the α9 helices distal to the catalytic tyrosine (Fig. 1), although the final α10 helix does occupy an equivalent position in both proteins. Similarity to Nuclear TopIB and Insights into Circumferential Binding—Fig. 3B shows a superposition of the N and C domains of DraTopIB on the structure of human nuclear TopIB in its complex with DNA (8Redinbo M.R. Stewart L. Kuhn P. Champoux J.J. Hol W.G. Science. 1998; 279: 1504-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). Nuclear TopIB is a much larger protein than vaccinia or DraTopIB and contains multiple structural components that have no counterpart in the viral and bacterial proteins. Nuclear TopIB forms a C-shaped clamp around duplex DNA. The two ends of the C-clamp consist of loops (the so-called ”lips“) that meet in a noncovalent “kiss” to envelop the target site (Fig. 3B). A subset of the β-strands of the N domain of DraTopIB that comprises a DNA-binding surface in vaccinia TopIB (24Cheng C. Shuman S. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2023818611,"Ribonucleotide reductases provide the building blocks for DNA synthesis. Three classes of enzymes are known, differing widely in amino acid sequence but with similar structural motives and allosteric regulation. Class I occurs in eukaryotes and aerobic prokaryotes, class II occurs in aerobic and anaerobic prokaryotes, and class III occurs in anaerobic prokaryotes. The eukaryote Euglena gracilis contains a class II enzyme (Gleason, F. K., and Hogenkamp, H. P. (1970) J. Biol. Chem. 245, 4894–4899) and, thus, forms an exception. Class II enzymes depend on vitamin B12 for their activity. We purified the reductase from Euglena cells, determined partial peptide sequences, identified its cDNA, and purified the recombinant enzyme. Its amino acid sequence and general properties, including its allosteric behavior, were similar to the class II reductase from Lactobacillus leichmannii. Both enzymes belong to a distinct small group of reductases that unlike all other homodimeric reductases are monomeric. They compensate the loss of the second polypeptide of dimeric enzymes by a large insertion in the monomeric chain. Data base searching and sequence comparison revealed a homolog from the eukaryote Dictyostelium discoideum as the closest relative to the Euglena reductase, suggesting that the class II enzyme was present in a common, B12-dependent, eukaryote ancestor.

Ribonucleotide reductases (RNRs) 3The abbreviations used are: RNR, ribonucleotide reductase; MetH, B12-dependent methionine biosynthesis; DTT, dithiothreitol. provide all cells with the deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) required for DNA replication and repair (1Eklund H. Uhlin U. Färnegårdh M. Logan D.T. Nordlund P. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2001; 77: 177-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 2Jordan A. Reichard P. Annu. Rev.

Structure Bonding. 1997; 88: 139-173Crossref Google Scholar). During evolution their appearance was a prerequisite for the transition of the RNA world to the DNA world (5Reichard P. Science. 1993; 260: 1773-1777Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 6Torrents E. Aloy P. Gibert I. Rodriguez-Trelles F. J. Mol. Evol. 2002; 55: 138-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). They catalyze the replacement of an OH group in the ribose moiety of a ribonucleoside di- or triphosphate by a hydrogen atom. Chemically this is a difficult reaction. It occurs by an unusual free radical mechanism in which a cysteine of the enzyme becomes a free radical and participates in the catalytic reaction (4Sjöberg B.-M. Structure Bonding. 1997; 88: 139-173Crossref Google Scholar, 7Stubbe J. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2003; 7: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The process by which the radical is generated differs between aerobic and anaerobic organisms; this has led to the definition of three different classes of ribonucleotide reductases (1Eklund H. Uhlin U. Färnegårdh M. Logan D.T. Nordlund P. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2001; 77: 177-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 2Jordan A. Reichard P. Annu. Rev.

Structure Bonding. 1997; 88: 139-173Crossref Google Scholar). Class I RNRs are aerobic enzymes that are found both in eukaryotes and microorganisms. They consist of two homodimeric proteins (R1 and R2), where R2 generates a cysteine radical in R1 with the aid of a stable tyrosyl radical (8Sjöberg B.M. Reichard P. Gräslund A. Ehrenberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 6863-6865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and R1 catalyzes the reduction of the ribonucleotide (7Stubbe J. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2003; 7: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Class II RNRs occur only in microorganisms and function both aerobically and anaerobically. Theses enzymes consist of a single polypeptide chain whose cysteine radical is generated by adenosyl cobalamin, vitamin B12 (3Lawrence C.C. Stubbe J. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 650-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). They are either monomers or homodimers. Class III RNRs are also exclusively present in microorganisms. They are anaerobic enzymes (9Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8383-8386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Catalysis resides in a single protein that contains a stable oxygen-sensitive glycyl radical. The glycyl radical is formed by a second protein that is not required for catalysis once the glycyl radical has been generated (10Torrents E. Eliasson R. Wolpher H. Gräslund A. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33488-33494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The enzymes from the three classes show little sequence homology. Nevertheless, their structures and allosteric regulation are similar, making it highly likely that they evolved from a common ancestor (11Reichard P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 397: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). All enzymes direct their substrate specificity toward reduction of each of the four canonical ribonucleotides via an allosteric “specificity site” to which effectors are bound such that binding of ATP or dATP directs the enzyme toward reduction of cytosine or uracil nucleotides, dTTP directs the enzyme binding toward reduction of guanine nucleotides, and dGTP directs the enzyme binding toward reduction of adenine nucleotides (11Reichard P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 397: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The detailed structural transitions bringing about switches in substrate specificity were recently elucidated for a class II reductase (12Larsson K.M. Jordan A. Eliasson R. Reichard P. Logan D.T. Nordlund P. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 1142-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Class I and III enzymes contain in addition an “activity site” where binding of ATP stimulates and dATP inhibits the overall activity of the reductase (11Reichard P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 397: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Euglena gracilis is a eukaryotic unicellular organism with a class II ribonucleotide reductase (13Gleason F.K. Hogenkamp H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 4894-4899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Hamilton F.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 4428-4434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and represents an exception from the general rule that eukaryotes contain class I enzymes. Ribonucleoside triphosphates serve as the substrate, and enzyme activity is absolutely dependent on adenosyl cobalamin. In these respects the reductase resembles the known class II enzyme from Lactobacillus leichmannii and differs from mammalian class I enzymes. A highly purified form of the enzyme catalyzed the reduction of all four canonical ribonucleoside triphosphates but apparently without the strict allosteric regulation of substrate specificity found for other ribonucleotide reductases (13Gleason F.K. Hogenkamp H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 4894-4899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Hamilton F.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 4428-4434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The structure and function of the Euglena enzyme is of interest with regard to the evolution of ribonucleotide reduction, but it also bears upon the evolution of B12 dependence among eukaryotes in general. Only prokaryotes synthesize B12 (15Roth J.R. Lawrence J.G. Bobik T.A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1996; 50: 137-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar), but numerous eukaryotes have a B12 requirement for growth. B12 dependence is widespread among animals (15Roth J.R. Lawrence J.G. Bobik T.A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1996; 50: 137-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar) and various unicellular organisms including diatoms, chrysophytes, dinoflagellates, euglenids (16Hunter S.H. Provasoli L. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1964; 15: 37-56Crossref Google Scholar), and some chlamydomonads (17Pringsheim E.G. Nature. 1962; 195: 604Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Although isolated reports can be found for B12-dependent enzymatic reactions among fungi (18Stutzenberger F. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 56: 294-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) and higher plants (19Poston J.M. Science. 1977; 195: 301-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), reports of B12-dependent growth for either group is lacking. In humans, two B12 dependent enzymatic steps are known; they are the methylmalonyl-CoA mutase reaction (20Parle-McDermott A. McManus E.J. Mills J.L. O'Leary V.B. Pangilinan F. Cox C. Weiler A. Molloy A.M. Conley M. Watson D. Scott J.M. Brody L.C. Kirke P.N. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2003; 80: 463-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) and the MetH reaction in methionine synthesis (15Roth J.R. Lawrence J.G. Bobik T.A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1996; 50: 137-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Outside of the animals, the biochemical basis of B12 dependence is usually obscure. Very recent findings indicate that B12 dependence in the green alga Lobomonas rostrata and, by inference, in many other algal groups (21Croft M.T. Lawrence A.D. Raux-Deery E. Warren M.J. Smith A.G. Nature. 2005; 438: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar) involves the B12-dependent (MetH-type) methionine biosynthesis route, as in humans, via loss of the B12-independent (MetE-type) enzyme. However, supplementing B12-deficient growth media with methionine could not restore normal Lobomonas growth levels (21Croft M.T. Lawrence A.D. Raux-Deery E. Warren M.J. Smith A.G. Nature. 2005; 438: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar), indicating the presence of additional B12-dependent steps. B12 dependence in Euglena relates to its B12-dependent ribonucleotide reductase (13Gleason F.K. Hogenkamp H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 4894-4899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Hamilton F.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 4428-4434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (22Watanabe F. Abe K. Tamura Y. Nakano Y. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 2631-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), which likely form the basis of the classical Euglena clinical assay for diagnosing human B12 deficiency and for quantifying human serum B12 levels (23Mollin D.L. Anderson B.B. Burman J.F. Clin. Haematol. 1976; 5: 521-546PubMed Google Scholar). Here we report the purification of class II ribonucleotide reductase from Euglena cells grown in the presence of limiting amounts of cobalamin. From the purified product we isolated and sequenced 11 peptide fragments, which were used to obtain a corresponding Euglena cDNA clone. After overproduction of the relevant protein in Escherichia coli we found that the protein indeed was an active class II ribonucleotide reductase with properties similar, but not identical to those of the enzyme prepared from Euglena cells. Both its structure and allosteric properties were closely related to the Lactobacillus enzyme. Materials—E. gracilis KLEBS, strain Z for protein purification, was donated by Prof. Paola Mariani. E. coli strain Rosetta(DE3)/pRARE and plasmid pET24a were from Novagen and were used for protein overexpression.

Appleton-Century-Crofts, New York1967: 174-180Google Scholar) on a rotary shaker under 16/8 h of light/dark photoperiods for 6 days in the laboratory of Prof. Paola Meriani in the Department of Biology, University of Padova, Italy. The amount of cobalamin in the medium was decreased to 7.5 ng/ml in place of the prescribed 1000 ng/ml (26Carell E.F. Seeger Jr., J.W. Biochem. J. 1980; 188: 573-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The final cell density (105 cells/ml) was only 10% of cultures grown with an excess of the vitamin, but the specific ribonucleotide reductase activity in cell extracts was 50–100 times higher. After centrifugation and washing with buffer A (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, 0.5 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm benzamidine, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin), the cells (7 g from 3 liters of culture) were suspended in 28 ml of buffer A and disintegrated in a French press. All further manipulations were made close to +4 °C. The suspension was centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 1 h, and the clear supernatant solution was precipitated with an equal volume of a neutralized saturated solution of ammonium sulfate. The precipitate obtained after centrifugation was dissolved in a small volume of buffer A and dialyzed against the same buffer until free from sulfate ions. This solution was chromatographed with a 300 ml linear gradient from 0 to 0.25 m KCl in buffer A on a 20-ml column of DE-52 equilibrated with the same buffer. Reductase activity appeared between 0.10 and 0.14 m KCl. Active fractions were combined and precipitated with solid ammonium sulfate to 80% saturation. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation and dissolved in 0.5 ml of buffer A. After clarification by centrifugation the solution was applied to a 55-ml column of Superdex-200 and eluted with buffer A. The column had been standardized with thyroglobulin (660 kDa), ferritin (443 kDa), and bovine serum albumin (66 kDa). An active symmetrical protein peak was eluted at ∼500 kDa. The typical purification procedure described above gave a 37-fold purification of the enzyme with a 40% yield resulting in a final specific activity of 14 (Table 1).TABLE 1Purification of RNR from Euglena cellsmg of proteinTotal unitsSpecific activityPurificationCell extract256970.380Ammonium sulfate138700.511.3DEAE8.4323.810Superdex-2002.2311437 Open table in a new tab Polypeptide Sequences—A fraction of the material from the Sephadex-200 column was electrophoresed on a preparative SDS-polyacrylamide gel after denaturation and alkylation of the cysteines (Fig. 1b). We excised the three Coomassie-stained major bands in the 80-kDa region and treated the α band and the combined β+γ bands separately as described in Hellman et al. (27Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Gonez J. Heldin C.H. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 224: 451-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). Briefly, we incubated the destained and moistened gel pieces with LysC protease from Achromobacter lyticus (WAKO Chemicals GmbH, Neuss, Germany), separated the resulting peptides by reversed phase liquid chromatography on a SMART system (Amersham Biosciences), and determined the amino acid sequences of selected well separated peaks in an Applied Biosystems Model 494A sequencer, resulting in sequences of 11 well defined peptides. In some cases we also determined their molecular mass by mass spectrometry. Identification and Cloning of Euglena Sequence—All peptide sequences from the hypothetical Euglena RNR matched 7 cDNA clones corresponding to a single mRNA in a collection of 10,000 Euglena EST sequences 4W. Martin, unpublished data. cloned in the EcoRI site of λZapII (Stratagene). The insert of the largest of the cDNAs (pEgRNR3, 2458 nucleotides long) was excised as a pSK(+) plasmid and sequenced. It had an open reading frame for 729 amino acids. The ATG start codon was preceded by the sequence 5′-ttttttcgtccacagtcca-3′, with the spliced leader sequence indicated in italics (data not shown). The presence of the spliced leader indicates that the cDNA is full size, and this together with peptide 80:18 suggests that the indicated methionine probably is the authentic N terminus of the protein. Production of Recombinant Enzyme—Two sets of PCR reactions were used for the amplification of E. gracilis reductase gene with plasmid pEgRNR3 as a template. In the first we used primer EugRNR-2up (5′-TTAACTTTAAGGAGATATACATATGGCTGAAAAGGA-3′; the ribosomal binding site is in bold) and primer EugRNR-3lw (5′-AGAGCTCATCAGAGCTTAATGCCìAGGCG-3′; the SacI site is underlined). The amplified band was used as a template for the second PCR using primer EugRNR-1up (5′-CCTCTAGAAATAATTTTGTTTAACTTTAAGAAGGAG-3′; the XbaI site is underlined, and the ribosomal binding site is in bold) and primer EugRNR-31w. Both PCRs were carried out in 50 μl with 50 pmol of each primer and 0.2 mm concentrations of each dNTP, 5 μl of 10× PCR buffer, and 1.5 units of High Expand Taq polymerase (Roche Applied Science) at 55 °C annealing temperature. The PCR fragment was digested with XbaI and SacI, and the resulting Euglena fragment (2430 bp) was inserted downstream the T7 promoter of pET24a generating plasmid pETS140. This plasmid was transformed into Rosetta(DE3)/pRARE E. coli. The plasmid-containing bacteria were grown at 25 °C with 60 μg/ml kanamycin and 17 μg/ml chloramphenicol to a final density of A550 of 0.5, induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h, collected by centrifugation (17.9 g of cell paste), and disrupted in an X-press in buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm CaCl2, 20 mm DTT, and protein inhibitors (Roche Applied Science)). After high speed centrifugation, the protein concentration was adjusted to 10 mg/ml, and the supernatant solution was first precipitated with streptomycin sulfate (final 1%) and, after a second centrifugation, with solid ammonium sulfate to 45% saturation. The collected precipitate was dissolved in a small volume of buffer B and chromatographed on a HiLoad 16/10 Phenyl-Sepharose High Performance (Amersham Biosciences) column with a 0.75 to 0 m gradient of ammonium sulfate in buffer B. Fractions were analyzed by SDS gel electrophoresis, and those with a band containing Euglena RNR were chromatographed on a HighLoad 16/10 Q-Sepharose High Performance column with a 0–400 mm KCl gradient in buffer B. Final purification of the enzyme was by chromatography on a Superdex-75 10/300 column with buffer B containing 200 mm KCl. Our procedure gave a 40-fold purified homogeneous protein (Fig. 1C) with a 25% yield (Table 2).TABLE 2Purification of recombinant Euglena RNRmg of proteinTotal unitsSpecific activityPurificationCell extract4568211.80Phenyl-Sepharose876207.13.9Q-Sepharose13431327.9Superdex-752.92097240 Open table in a new tab Assay of Reductase Activity—In standard assays the protein was incubated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.4 mm dATP, 60 mm DTT, 6 μm adenosylcobalamin, and 0. 7 mm [3H]CTP (12996 cpm/min·pmol–1) for 20 min at 25 °C in a final volume of 0.05 ml. The reaction was terminated with 0.5 ml of 1 m perchloric acid, and the amount of dCTP formed was determined by chromatography on Dowex-50 (28Thelander L. Sjöberg B.R. Eriksson S. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 51: 227-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The reduction of ATP and GTP was assayed under identical conditions with 14C-labeled substrates and various effectors as shown in Fig. 4. In this case we terminated the reaction by immersion in a boiling water bath, transformed nucleotides to nucleosides with alkaline phosphatase, and determined the amount of labeled deoxynucleosides as described earlier (29Eliasson R. Pontis E. Jordan A. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7182-7189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). One enzyme unit corresponds to 1 nmol of dCTP formed per min. Specific enzyme activity is units/mg of protein. Protein was measured by the Bradford assay (30Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as standard. Phylogenetic Analyses—RNR homologues were identified by a BLAST search of the non-redundant data base at GenBank™ (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), retrieved, and aligned using ClustalW (31Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56002) Google Scholar). Gapped positions in the alignment were removed. Protein LogDet distances (32Lockhart P.J. Steel M.A. Hendy M.D. Penny D. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1994; 11: 605-612PubMed Google Scholar) between protein coding sequences were determined with LDDist (33Thollesson M. Bioinformatics. 2004; 20: 416-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Neighbor-Net planar graphs of splits among protein LogDet distances were constructed with Nnet (34Bryant D. Moulton V. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2004; 21: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar) and visualized with Splitstree (35Huson D.H. Bioinformatics. 1998; 14: 68-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar). Isolation and Properties of RNR Purified from Euglena Cells—Our starting material was an extract of Euglena grown under B12 limitation (26Carell E.F. Seeger Jr., J.W. Biochem. J. 1980; 188: 573-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) with ∼100-fold higher RNR activity than extracts from cells grown in the presence of an excess of the vitamin. After a three-step purification (see “Experimental Procedures”) we obtained a 37-fold purified protein with a specific activity of 14. This is very low, as in a similar assay other pure class II enzymes had specific activities ranging from 250 to 1800 (29Eliasson R. Pontis E. Jordan A. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7182-7189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Gel patterns from denaturing gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1A) revealed an accumulation during purification of two bands between the 77- and 97-kDa markers, suggesting that one or both of these bands were derived from the reductase. After purification without protease inhibitors, the relative amount of the slowest moving band decreased, and less enzyme activity was recovered, suggesting that proteolytic degradation was a major complication. This was strongly supported from the presence of several identical peptides in both major bands (Table 3). During the last step (gel filtration on Superdex-200) a single active protein peak with an estimated molecular mass of 500 kDa eluted between the thyroglobulin and ferritin markers.TABLE 3Peptide sequences from RNR prepared from Euglena cellsPeptideSourceSequence81:25β + γKFMIPDK81:46β + γKGISFLPRYPMGAFK80:6αKI?LVGEKLL80.8αKE?QYEEAIRKLL81:39αKRTLYSALR?YAFEM80:9aPeptides present in both α and β + γ bands.α/β +γKLHCHWDAQKLL80:18aPeptides present in both α and β + γ bands.α/β + γKENVHPQVISSFPTPSK80:19aPeptides present in both α and β + γ bands.α/β + γKREGWVESLK80:22aPeptides present in both α and β + γ bands.α/β + γKTFGGTSSGPGPLINLHKLL81:36αKEFLDLKLL81:47αKKPPFGFNGLGEVVYLLbLL, peptides with a high degree of identity to L. leichmannii RNR (36Booker S.

Enzyme activity absolutely required adenosyl cobalamin (Km = 4 μm) and DTT (Km = 20 mm). In contrast to an earlier report (14Hamilton F.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 4428-4434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Mg2+ was not required but was inhibitory at concentrations above 5 mm. Under standard conditions reduced DTT served as substitute for the physiological hydrogen donor, which probably was thioredoxin (24Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13963-13966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because Euglena thioredoxin was not available, we tested the effect of reduced E. coli thioredoxin and found that it was strongly stimulatory (Fig. 2). In these experiments thioredoxin was maintained in the reduced state by increasing concentrations of DTT. At low concentrations the dithiol by itself only poorly supported the reduction of CTP. The addition of thioredoxin stimulated up to 10-fold, demonstrating that E. coli thioredoxin was a hydrogen donor for the Euglena reductase. The reaction showed a broad pH optimum between 7 and 9 in Tris and phosphate buffers (data not shown). In experiments not shown here we investigated allosteric effects and found that at low concentrations of CTP the reaction was stimulated by dATP or dGTP and inhibited by dTTP. These effects largely disappeared, however, at higher concentrations of the substrate. More extensive experiments, including additional substrates and effectors, will be described in detail below for the recombinant enzyme. Sequences of Euglena Peptides—Despite the inhomogeneity and low activity of our enzyme preparation, its behavior on gel electrophoresis suggested that it largely consisted of Euglena RNR. We used the preparation to determine internal peptide sequences for cloning of the enzyme as described under “Experimental Procedures” and obtained the 11 sequences given in Table 3. Because the sequenced peptides were derived by proteolysis with the highly specific LysC protease, we have added a Lys residue at the N terminus of each peptide. We obtained the sequences of peptides 81:25 and 81:46 from the β + γ band, the sequences indicated by an asterisk from both the α and the β + γ bands, and the remaining sequences from the α band. Sequences marked “LL” in the Table show a high degree of identity with the sequence of L. leichmannii RNR (36Booker S. Stubbe J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8352-8356Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Cloning of E. gracilis RNR and Isolation of Recombinant Enzyme— Preliminary attempts to use the peptide sequence information to clone the complete E. gracilis cDNA were unsuccessful. However, we found that all sequences matched the sequence from a 2458-nucleotide-long E. gracilis cDNA clone (pEgRNR3) that contained an open reading frame for 729 amino acids with the sequence shown in Fig. 3. The 11-peptide sequences of Table 3 are underlined in the figure. Data base searching revealed 13 class II sequences with >25% amino acid sequence identity to the Euglena enzyme across 600 or more contiguous amino acids, with the closest match observed from the eukaryote Dictyostelium discoideum (51% identity) followed by several Lactobacillus species including L. leichmannii (31% identity). These sequences are included for comparison in Fig. 3. Conserved residues included in all cases the catalytically important cysteines highlighted in Fig. 3. Interestingly, most of the residues that are functionally important in the structure of L. leichmannii (37Sintchak M.D. Arjara G. Kellogg B.A. Stubbe J. Drennan C.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) are also present in the Euglena protein (data not shown). The close relationship between the Euglena and Lactobacillus sequences suggests that the former belongs to the group of monomeric class II reductases (see “Discussion”). We overproduced the Euglena reductase in the E. coli Rosetta (DE3) strain carrying plasmid pRARE encoding all the rare codons of E. coli and plasmid pETS140 carrying the cDNA sequence of Euglena RNR. After induction with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside we obtained soluble RNR protein in bacterial extracts and purified the enzyme to homogeneity (Table 2 and Fig. 1c) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The protein showed an apparent molecular mass of 82 kDa on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 1C). On chromatography on Superdex-200 the homogenous protein peak eluted with a calculated molecular mass of 470 kDa. This value did not change in the presence of the allosteric effector dATP or the cofactor adenosyl cobalamin in the buffer.

As with many other retroviruses, HTLV-1 uses ribosomal frameshifting to regulate the relative expression of Gag proteins and the viral replication enzymes. In many retroviruses, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Rous sarcoma virus (RSV), protein synthesis that initiates from the gag start codon gives rise to both Gag and Gag-Pol polyprotein precursors. A ribosomal frameshift site encoded either at the 5′-end of pol (HIV) or at the 3′-end of gag (RSV) allows the synthesis of the Gag-Pol polyprotein (1.Jacks T. Power M.D. Masiarz F.R. Luciw P.A.

In contrast, the pro gene of some retroviruses, such as HTLV, mouse mammary tumor virus, and Mason-Pfizer monkey virus, is in a separate reading frame from both gag and pol. Thus, the expression of Gag-Pol polyprotein in these retroviruses involves two ribosomal frameshifts: one where gag and pro overlap and the second within the pro/pol overlap (3.Nam S.H. Kidokoro M.

In HTLV-1, they are Gag (Pr53), Gag-Pro (Pr76), and Gag-Pro-Pol (Pr180). Based on in vitro translation of viral RNA, the molar ratio of the Gag, Gag-Pro, and Gag-Pro-Pol polyproteins was estimated to be about 100:10:1 (12.Mador N. Panet A. Honigman A. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 2400-2404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This means that the relative amounts of Pol to Gag produced by HTLV-1 would be 5–10-fold less than the amount present in single-frameshift retroviruses, such as HIV and RSV (1.Jacks T.

Retroviral pol genes encode RT and integrase (IN), which are required for the replication and integration of the viral genome. The Pol precursor is enzymatically cleaved by the viral protease to yield the subunits of the RT complex. The reverse transcriptases of HIV-1, RSV, and murine leukemia virus are the prototypes of three distinct forms of RT (16.Telesnitsky A. Goff S.P. Coffin J.M. Hughes S.H. Varmus H.E. Retroviruses. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1997: 121-160Google Scholar). The heterodimeric RSV RT consists of an RT-IN β subunit and the RT α subunit (17.Werner S. Wohrl B.M. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3245-3252Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). HIV-1 RT is a smaller heterodimer, where the larger subunit (p66) contains both polymerase and RNase H domains, and the smaller subunit (p51) corresponds closely, but not exactly, to the polymerase domain (18.Le Grice S.F.

In contrast to the RTs of HIV and RSV, the RT of murine leukemia virus is a monomer in solution, although it may dimerize when it binds nucleic acid (23.Roth M.J. Tanese N. Goff S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9326-9335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Das D. Georgiadis M.M. Structure (Camb.). 2004; 12: 819-829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Shortly after the virus was identified in 1980, some basic properties of the virion-associated HTLV-1 RT were defined. The virion-associated enzyme had DNA polymerase and RNase H activity and was reported to have a molecular mass of about 95 kDa (25.Rho H.M. Poiesz B. Ruscetti F.W. Gallo R.C. Virology. 1981; 112: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). However, neither the Pol cleavage products present in HTLV-1 virions nor their quaternary organization in the RT complex are known. Sequence alignments of diverse retroviral pol genes have been used to try to predict the HTLV-1 polymerase, ribonuclease H, and integrase functional domains (26.Barber A.M. Hizi A. Maizel Jr., J.V. Hughes S.H. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1990; 6: 1061-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 27.Johnson M.S. McClure M.A. Feng D.F. Gray J. Doolittle R.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, these sequence alignments did not correctly predict the N terminus of HTLV-1 RT. We recently demonstrated that the N-terminal residue of RT is not encoded immediately adjacent to the C terminus of protease (PR), as it is in other retroviruses (28.Trentin B. Rebeyrotte N. Mamoun R.Z. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6504-6510Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Heidecker G. Hill S. Lloyd P.A. Derse D. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 13101-13105Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 31.Agbuya P.G. Sherman N.E. Moen L.K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 392: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Instead, there is an 8-amino acid peptide, p1, that separates PR and RT. Removal of p1 from the C terminus of PR is not required for proteolytic activity, but removal of p1 from the N terminus of RT is essential for virion-associated RT activity and infectivity (30.Heidecker G. Hill S. Lloyd P.A. Derse D. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 13101-13105Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In order to define HTLV-1 Pol processing and to characterize the mature RT, we constructed virus expression plasmids that generate VLPs containing ∼10-fold higher levels of Pol than wild-type virions. Immunoblotting of VLPs from transfected cells revealed Pol cleavage products corresponding to RT-IN, RT (p62), polymerase (p49), and RNase H (p15). Pol maturation was analyzed by immunoblotting proteins from wild type and mutant VLPs. Protease cleavage sites within Pol were then mapped by mutagenesis or by in vitro PR cleavage reactions. Immunoprecipitation of an epitope-tagged version of p62 RT from HTLV-1 VLPs co-precipitated the untagged p49 polymerase subunit, suggesting that the virion-associated HTLV-1 RT can exist as a p62/p49 heterodimer, analogous to the HIV-1 p66/p51 RT complex. Plasmids—pCMVHT-1Δenv is an HTLV-1 expression plasmid that produces virus-like particles (VLPs) that lack the Env glycoprotein when the plasmid is transfected into cultured cells (32.Derse D. Hill S.A. Lloyd P.A. Chung H. Morse B.A. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 8461-8468Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). pCMVHT-1Δenv-polfs was constructed from pCMVHT-1Δenv by inserting a deoxycytidine residue into the pro/pol ribosomal frameshift site using site-directed mutagenesis. This mutant plasmid expresses the HTLV-1 Gag-Pro-Pol polyprotein precursor via a single frameshifting event. The level of Gag-Pro-Pol expression is about 10-fold higher than from the parent HTLV-1 plasmid. Unless otherwise indicated, the following Pol mutations were constructed in the pCMVHT-1Δenv-polfs backbone. Pol is 880 amino acids long, and our numbering of the 880-amino acid Pol is based on the N terminus of RT having the sequence GLEHLP (30.Heidecker G. Hill S. Lloyd P.A. Derse D. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 13101-13105Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The INΔ mutation creates a stop codon at amino acid 718; the RHΔ mutation creates a stop codon at amino acid 514; and the RTΔ mutation creates a premature stop codon at amino acid 311. The F442am mutation creates a stop codon at amino acid residue 442 of Pol. An 11-amino acid hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag followed by a stop codon was inserted after amino acid 581 to construct the RH-HA vector; the HA tag is inserted immediately upstream of the predicted RT/IN cleavage site. An HA tag was also inserted after amino acid residue 738, in the integrase domain, to make IN-HA. To construct the IN-HA-psite plasmid, the amino acids at the predicted RT/IN cleavage site (residues 582–585 of Pol) were changed from VLQL to GAQA. Cell Lines, Transfections, and Preparation of Virus-like Particles—The human kidney line 293T was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, l-glutamine, and antibiotics. Virus stocks were generated by transfection of 293T cells with expression plasmids by calcium phosphate co-precipitation. The culture medium was replaced 16 h after transfection with Advanced Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 2% ultralow IgG fetal bovine serum, GlutaMAX-1, and antibiotics. Virus-containing supernatants were collected 24 h later. Transfected cell supernatants were cleared by low speed centrifugation and filtered through 0.45-μm pore size low protein-binding filters (Millipore). VLPs were concentrated by ultracentrifugation through a 20% glycerol cushion in a Ti70 rotor at 30,000 rpm for 90 min at 4 °C. The HTLV-1 transformed T-cell lines, MT-2, C10/MJ, and C8166 were maintained in RPMI 1640 and 10% fetal bovine serum. MT-2 and C10/MJ cells produce HTLV-1 virions, and C8166 does not. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in AIM-V medium (supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum), and virus stocks were harvested after 24 h. Supernatants were cleared by low speed centrifugation and filtered through 0.45-μm pore size low protein-binding filters. Virus particles were collected by ultracentrifugation, as described above. Antibodies—A 15-amino acid-long synthetic peptide, NH2-Cys-SENKTQQTPGTIKF-COOH (ProSci, Inc.), which contained a cysteine residue at the amino terminus and amino acid residues 204–217 of the mature HTLV-1 RT, was used to raise rabbit antiserum designated as anti-RTM. An aliquot of the affinity-purified antibody was biotinylated (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) and used to detect immunoprecipitated Pol products. In addition, a previously described rabbit polyclonal antibody that recognizes amino acids 4–16 of HTLV-1 RT, designated as anti-RTN, was used to detect Pol products (30.Heidecker G. Hill S. Lloyd P.A. Derse D. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 13101-13105Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Hemagglutin-tagged Pol products were immunoprecipitated with an agarose-conjugated anti-HA antibody (Covance clone 16B12). A rat monoclonal antibody (Roche Applied Science clone 3F10) was used for chemiluminescent detection of immunoprecipitated HA-tagged protein. A mouse monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) clone F-7 or Covance clone 16B12) was used to detect the epitope-tagged Pol products on Western blots of VLP lysates. A mouse monoclonal antibody (Zeptometrix clone 46/6.11.1.3) specific for HTLV-1 MA (p19) was used to monitor Gag processing. Immunoblotting—VLPs were lysed in LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) and denatured under reducing conditions prior to separation on 4–12% Bis-Tris gels in MES buffer or 10% Bis-Tris gels in MOPS buffer. Proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore) membranes for immunodetection. In most cases, blots were probed with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and visualized by chemiluminescence. Blots of immunoprecipitated proteins were probed with biotinylated anti-RTM and detected by avidin-horseradish peroxidase and chemiluminescent staining. Immunopurification—VLPs were lysed in LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen). One-fifth of the volume was reserved for analysis by Western blotting, and the remaining lysate was diluted 20-fold in radioimmune precipitation buffer. The viral lysates were precleared with agarose-conjugated normal mouse IgG for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated overnight with agarose-conjugated mouse anti-HA (Covance). After the overnight incubation, the agarose beads were washed five times with radioimmune precipitation buffer before eluting bound protein with LDS sample buffer. The VLP lysate and immunopurified samples were heated at 70 °C for 10 min under reducing conditions, loaded onto a 10% Bis-Tris polyacrylamide gel, and separated at 150 V in MOPS buffer. Proteins were transferred to an Immobilon P membrane (Millipore), probed with biotinylated anti-RTM, and detected by avidin-horseradish peroxidase and chemiluminescent staining. In Vitro RT Assays—Reverse transcriptase assays were performed with a bacteriophage MS2 RNA template and a corresponding primer. The template-primer was prepared by combining equimolar amounts of MS2 RNA (Roche Applied Science) and RT-1 DNA primer (5′-GGAAGAAACTCTTGAAGGTG-3′) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, plus 0.1 mm EDTA. The template-primer was annealed by heating at 95 °C for 5 min and then at 37 °C for 30 min, followed by the addition of 200 units of RNasin (Promega) or SUPERase-In (Ambion). RT reactions were carried out in a final volume of 25 μl containing 20 μl of RT buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 75 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 μm dNTPs) plus 2 μl (0.245 pmol) of MS2 RNA template-primer and 3 μl of virion extract. Reactions were incubated for 3 min at 37 °C followed by heating at 95 °C for 7 min. Virion extracts were prepared by centrifugation of cell culture supernatants and lysis of the virion pellet in RT extraction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 20% glycerol, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) for 15 min on ice. The DNA products were quantified by Taqman real time PCR analysis. Real time PCR quantitation of the RT reaction products was performed on a Prism 7700 sequence detector (PerkinElmer Life Sciences/Applied Biosystems). 25-μl PCRs contained 5 μl of the RT reaction plus 20 μl of Taqman master mix (Applied Biosystems), containing 100 ng of RT-2 primer (5′-CCTAAACGAAGATCGAAAGT-3′), 100 ng of RT-3 primer (5′-AACCTTCGTAAGCATCTCAT-3′), 100 ng of Taqman probe (5′-carboxyfluorescein-TGAGTGATATCCAGGGTGCA-6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine-3′), 0.02 units of RNase H (Invitrogen), 0.0005 units of RNase A, and 0.02 units of RNase T1 (Ambion). Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min to degrade any residual RNA that could serve as a template for Taq polymerase (33.Jones M.D. Foulkes N.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 8387-8388Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 34.Shaffer A.L. Wojnar W. Nelson W. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 190: 292-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The PCR amplification conditions were 50 °C for 2 min followed by 95 °C for 10 min to activate the DNA polymerase and then 50 cycles of 15 s at 94 °C and 1 min at 60 °C. Calibration curves were derived with a pCR-II TOPO plasmid containing a cDNA segment of the MS2 genome (nucleotides 21–790; GenBank™ accession number V00642), which was serially diluted over the range of 2.5 × 100 to 2.5 × 107 molecules, as previously described (35.Princler G.L. Julias J.G. Hughes S.H. Derse D. Virology. 2003; 317: 136-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). RT activity is expressed as the number of cDNA molecules generated under these reaction conditions per pg of Gag protein added to the reaction. The HTLV-1 p19 (MA) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit from Zeptometrix was used to quantify the Gag protein. In Vitro Cleavage of Synthetic Peptides—Oligopeptides were obtained from Biosynthesis Inc. (Lewisville, TX). Stock solutions and dilutions were made in distilled water, and the peptide concentrations were determined by amino acid analysis with a Beckman 6300 amino acid analyzer. Stabilized, purified HTLV-1 PR was prepared as described previously (36.Louis J.M. Oroszlan S. Tozser J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6660-6666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Active site titration of the PR was performed using peptide KTKVL-r-VVQPK (IB268), where r represents a reduced peptide bond, as described previously (37.Kadas J. Weber I.T. Bagossi P. Miklossy G. Boross P. Oroszlan S. Tozser J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27148-27157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The PR assays were initiated by the mixing of 5 μl (34–1700 nm) of purified HTLV-1 PR with 10 μlof 2× incubation buffer (0.5 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 5.6, containing 10% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 4 m NaCl) and 5 μl of 0.04–1.2 mm substrate. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37° C for 1 h or overnight, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 180 μl of 1% trifluoroacetic acid, and an aliquot was injected onto a Nova-Pak C18 reversed-phase chromatography column (3.9 × 150 mm; Waters Associates, Inc.) using an automatic injector. Substrates and the cleavage products were separated using an increasing water-acetonitrile gradient (0–100%) in the presence of 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. Cleavage product peaks were collected and were identified by mass spectrometric analysis and by amino acid analysis, which was also used to quantitate the amount of products generated. Due to the estimated low Km value, the kcat/Km value for the most efficiently cleaved peptide was determined using a competition assay performed in triplicate, as previously described for several HTLV-1 PR substrates (38.Tozser J. Zahuczky G. Bagossi P. Louis J.M. Copeland T.D. Oroszlan S. Harrison R.W. Weber I.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6287-6295Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Pol Synthesis and Predicted Cleavage Products—Expression of HTLV-1 Pol requires that two ribosomal frameshifts occur during translation of viral mRNA. Neither frameshift is efficient; translation produces Gag, Gag-Pro, and Gag-Pro-Pol polyprotein precursors in a ratio of about 100:10:1 (Fig. 1A). These polyproteins assemble into an immature virion; maturation of the virion by proteolytic processing is predicted to produce a 98-kDa Pol precursor, containing the p1, polymerase, ribonuclease H, and integrase domains. Removal of p1 is required for virion-associated RT activity and virus replication (30.Heidecker G. Hill S. Lloyd P.A. Derse D. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 13101-13105Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). There is a predicted processing site at the junction of the RNase H and integrase domains that would produce an IN protein of ∼33 kDa. The combined molecular mass of the polymerase and ribonuclease H domains is estimated to be about 64 kDa. If cleavage were also to occur between the polymerase and RNase H domain in HTLV-1 RT, similar to the cleavage that takes place in HIV-1 RT, the resulting peptides would be ∼50 and 14 kDa, respectively. The small amount of mature RT present in virions makes it difficult to detect virion-associated HTLV-1 RT. Similar difficulties have been encountered in investigations of the RTs of mouse mammary tumor virus and Mason-Pfizer monkey virus, which also use two ribosomal frameshifts to express Pol (39.Entin-Meer M. Avidan O. Hizi A. Virology. 2003; 310: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). We increased the expression of Gag-Pro-Pol in HTLV-1 VLPs by inserting a base pair into the second ribosomal frameshift site to create the polfs construct: pCMVHTΔenv-polfs (Fig. 1A) (30.Heidecker G. Hill S. Lloyd P.A. Derse D. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 13101-13105Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This insertion mutation places the pro and pol open reading frames in the same reading frame, increasing the production of Gag-Pro-Pol and eliminating the expression of Gag-Pro. Polfs constructs efficiently produce VLPs in which Gag is processed normally (30.Heidecker G. Hill S. Lloyd P.A. Derse D. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 13101-13105Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Rabbit antiserum was raised against a peptide in the pro/pol transframe protein (p9), whose sequence corresponds to amino acids 4–16 of the mature RT; this antiserum is designated anti-RTN (30.Heidecker G. Hill S. Lloyd P.A. Derse D. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 13101-13105Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In addition, we recently made an antiserum, designated as anti-RTM, against a peptide corresponding to residues 204–217 of the mature HTLV-1 RT. Fig. 1B shows an immunoblot of HTLV-1 proteins from VLPs derived from transfected 293T cells and from virions released by productively infected T-cell lines probed with the anti-RTM antibody. Specific bands were not detected in supernatant from mock-transfected 293T cells (lane 1) or from C8166 T-cells, which do not produce HTLV-1 structural proteins (lane 4). A single band migrating at ∼49 kDa was detected in VLPs from 293T cells transfected with HTLV-1 expression plasmids (lane 2) and from chronically HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines, MT-2 (lane 5) and C10/MJ (lane 6). VLPs from 293T cells transfected with the polfs construct contained significantly more Pol proteins than wild-type VLPs, as evidenced by the intensity of the protein bands in lane 3. Although the p49 band was the most intense, other bands can be seen that migrate at 163, 98, and 62 kDa, consistent with the predicted sizes for Gag-Pro-Pol, RT-IN, and RT, respectively. Immunoblots probed with the anti-RTN antibody gave similar results. None of these Pol products were detected in immunoblots of proteins from VLPs with a mutated protease (data not shown). Although the polfs mutation resulted in a significantly higher amount of Pol products in VLPs, the polymerase activity associated with these virions is (at best) only about 2–3-fold higher than the polymerase activity associated with wild-type virions rather than the 10-fold higher activity that might be expected (Table 1).TABLE 1Virion-associated RT activityAverage RT/pgpCMVHT-1Δenv2.2 ± 0.83pCMVHT-1Δenv-polfs2.8 ± 0.78pCMVHT-1Δenv-polfs IN-HA1.2 ± 0.11pCMVHT-1Δenv-polfs IN-HA-psite1.0 ± 0.16pCMVHT-1Δenv-polfs RH-HA6.0 ± 1.8pCMVHT-1Δenv-polfs ΔRH0.0068 ± 0.0067pCMVHT-1Δenv-polfs F442am0.00053 ± 0.00028pUC190 Open table in a new tab Characterization of the Pol Cleavage Products—To identify the Pol cleavage products observed in the immunoblots of HTLV-1 virus and VLPs, we transfected 293T cells with a series of pCMVHT-1Δenv-polfs constructs encoding truncated versions of the Gag-Pro-Pol polyprotein (Fig. 2A). Stop codons were introduced into the integrase, ribonuclease H, or polymerase regions of pol; these will shorten the Gag-Pro-Pol polyprotein by 163 (INΔ), 368 (RHΔ), or 572 (RTΔ) residues. Immunoblots of the VLP lysates were probed with anti-RTN antibody (Fig. 2B) or with anti-p19 (MA) antibody (Fig. 2C). Immunoblots probed with anti-RTN antibody showed that VLP lysates from cells transfected with pCMVHT-1Δenv-polfs (designated here as wild type) produce bands of ∼163, 98, 62, and 49 kDa and a smaller band of about 17 kDa (Fig. 2B, lane 1); as seen previously, the p49 band was the most intense. The 163-kDa band, which is Gag-Pro-Pol, shows an appropriate decrease in size in the INΔ (lane 2), RHΔ (lane 3), and RTΔ (lane 4) mutations. As expected, these high molecular weight bands were detected with the anti-p19 (MA) antibody (Fig. 2C). The band in lane 1 running at ∼98 kDa is RT-IN; its size is decreased to ∼80 kDa in the INΔ mutant (lane 2). The p62 band corresponds to RT, since it was not affected by the INΔ mutation, but it was reduced to ∼57 kDa in the RHΔ VLPs. The p49 protein was present in all VLPs except those from the RTΔ mutant, which caused this band to shift to ∼35 kDa. The p49 protein is derived by the proteolytic cleavage of RT-IN or p62 RT, and it contains the N terminus of RT, because the anti-RTN antibody recognizes it. Likewise, the band migrating at ∼17 kDa, which appears to be present in all VLPs except RTΔ, is believed to be an N-terminal fragment of RT. We monitored the effects of the Pol truncations on HTLV-1 Gag processing, because it has been reported that truncations of the HIV-1 pol domain impair and interfere with proper virion assembly, release, and maturation of virus particles (40.Bukovsky A. Gottlinger H. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6820-6825Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41.Quillent C. Borman A.M. Paulous S. Dauguet C. Clavel F. Virology. 1996; 219: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Although the polfs mutation resulted in the accumulation of more pr53 Gag polyprotein precursor compared with wild-type VLPs, the Pol truncations did not cause Gag processing defects or appear to affect the packaging of Gag-Pro-Pol in VLPs (Fig. 2C). In vitro reverse transcription of bacteriophage MS2 RNA, quantified by Taqman real time PCR, was used to measure the level of virion-associated RT activity of the Pol truncation mutants (described below). As expected, the truncation (ΔRH) or deletion (F442am) of the RNase H domain eliminated the polymerase activity of RT (Table 1). The absence of a full-length integrase domain (ΔIN, IN-HA, IN-HA-psite, and RH-HA) had no noticeable effect on polymerase activity (data not shown for"
https://openalex.org/W2153070673,"Transcriptionally silent chromatin in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is associated with histone hypoacetylation and is formed through the action of the Sir histone deacetylase complex. A histone acetyltransferase (HAT) targeted near silent chromatin can overcome silencing at a distance by increasing histone acetylation in a sizable region. However, how a tethered HAT acetylates distant nucleosomes has not been resolved. We demonstrate here that targeting the histone H3-specific HAT Gcn5p promotes acetylation of not only histone H3 but also histone H4 in a broad region. We also show that long range anti-silencing and histone acetylation by targeted HATs can be blocked by nucleosome-excluding sequences. These results are consistent with the contention that a tethered HAT promotes stepwise propagation of histone acetylation along the chromatin. Because histone hypoacetylation is key to the formation and maintenance of transcriptionally silent chromatin, it is believed that acetylation promoted by a targeted HAT disrupts silent chromatin thereby overcoming silencing. However, we show that the acetylated and transcriptionally active region created by a tethered HAT retains structural hallmarks of Sir-dependent silent chromatin and remains associated with Sir proteins indicating that tethered HATs overcome silencing without completely dismantling silent chromatin.

Eukaryotic DNA is packed into chromatin through the formation of nucleosomes composed of a histone octamer around which 147 bp of DNA is wrapped (1.Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6725) Google Scholar, 2.Richmond T.J. Davey C.A. Nature. 2003; 423: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). Chromatin plays a pivotal role in the regulation of gene expression. It is subject to various modifications that differentially affect its compaction and accessibility to transcriptional regulators. The two major types of modifications of chromatin structure are the remodeling of nucleosome patterning along the chromatin fiber and covalent modifications of histones, including acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitination (3.Lusser A. Kadonaga J.T. BioEssays. 2003; 25: 1192-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 4.Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6448) Google Scholar). Increasing evidence indicates that histone modifications create a histone code (surface) that is read (recognized) by other proteins to bring about various downstream events (5.Fischle W. Wang Y. Allis C.D. Nature. 2003; 425: 475-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 6.Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (7467) Google Scholar, 7.Kurdistani S.K.

Acetylation of the N-terminal lysine residues of histones neutralizes the positive charge they carry, which is believed to alter the property of nucleosomes resulting in a reduction in the degree of chromatin compaction (8.Workman J.L. Kingston R.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 545-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar). Moreover, as an important part of the histone code, acetyllysines on histones serve as recognition sites for regulatory factors (5.Fischle W. Wang Y. Allis C.D. Nature. 2003; 425: 475-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 6.Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (7467) Google Scholar, 9.Zeng L. Zhou M.M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 124-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Promoter-specific localized hyperacetylation of histones may lead to activation of individual genes, whereas coordinated acetylation of histones across a sizable chromosomal region may help maintain a transcriptionally poised chromatin state (10.Bulger M.

Biochem. 2001; 70: 81-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar). For example, yeast Gcn5p is a member of the GNAT (Gcn5-related N-acetyltransferase) family that prefers histones H3 and H2B as substrates, whereas Esa1p belongs to the MYST (MOZ, Ybf2/Sas3, Sas2, and Tip60) family that preferentially acetylates histones H4 and H2A (13.Roth S.Y.

A native HAT usually functions as part of a multisubunit regulatory complex or the transcription machinery, which directs the HAT to proper gene targets and helps it gain access to nucleosomal histones (13.Roth S.Y. Denu J.M. Allis C.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 81-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar). Gcn5p is a shared component of the SAGA complex and its three smaller variants SLIK, ADA, and HAT-A2, whereas Esa1p is a subunit of NuA4 or a smaller core complex called piccolo NuA4 (14.Allard S.

Although a large number of HAT complexes has been characterized, it is still largely unknown how they function to create/maintain gene-specific, locus/domain-specific, or global histone acetylation. Of particular interest is how a targeted HAT “reaches” and acetylates nucleosomes at a distance, for which two distinct models have been proposed (10.Bulger M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21689-21692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 11.Forsberg E.C. Bresnick E.H. BioEssays. 2001; 23: 820-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The looping model suggests that a HAT complex recruited to a regulatory element engages in protein-protein interactions with factors bound at the promoter thereby reaching the promoter. Such factors can be transcriptional activators or the preinitiation complex. On the other hand, the spreading model proposes that local acetylation of histones carried out by a targeted HAT serves to recruit additional HATs thereby initiating the spread of HAT complexes along the chromatin. However, direct evidence supporting either model is lacking. Contrary to the lack of understanding of long range actions of HATs, long range functions of certain histone deacetylases (HDACs) have been well characterized (18.Yang X.J. Seto E. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2003; 13: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Opposite to histone acetylation, histone deacetylation is often involved in the repression/silencing of gene expression. Histone deacetylation may help form a more rigid chromatin structure thereby decreasing DNA accessibility to transcriptional activators and/or the transcription machinery. For example, promoter-targeted deacetylation can inhibit the recruitment of transcription factors to promoters (19.Deckert J. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6458-6470Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). HDACs are also involved in the establishment of heterochromatin/silent chromatin domains that underlie region-specific, gene nonspecific transcriptional silencing. In this case, a sizable region is associated with relatively uniform hypoacetylation of histones. Silent domains in Saccharomyces cerevisiae include the cryptic mating loci HML and HMR, as well as regions near telomeres (20.Moazed D. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 489-498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 21.Rusche L.N. Kirchmaier A.L. Rine J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 481-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). Histone hypoacetylation in these regions depends on the NAD+-dependent HDAC Sir2p, which forms a silencing complex with Sir3p and Sir4p (20.Moazed D. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 489-498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 21.Rusche L.N. Kirchmaier A.L. Rine J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 481-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). The Sir complex is recruited to silent loci through interactions with telomere-binding proteins or factors that bind to special sequences called silencers flanking HML and HMR. Importantly, Sir complexes interact with each other and bind to the N termini of histones H3 and H4 with a strong preference for their unacetylated forms (22.Carmen A.A. Milne L. Grunstein M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4778-4781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 23.Hecht A. Laroche T. Strahl-Bolsinger S. Gasser S.M. Grunstein M.

Cell. 2005; 121: 515-527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, a model for the establishment of silent chromatin has been proposed (20.Moazed D. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 489-498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 21.Rusche L.N. Kirchmaier A.L. Rine J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 481-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar, 25.Grewal S.I. Moazed D. Science. 2003; 301: 798-7802Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). In this model, a Sir complex is recruited to a silencer/telomere, and Sir2p deacetylates an adjacent nucleosome, which then binds another Sir complex with high affinity. The nucleosome-bound Sir complex then deacetylates the neighboring nucleosome enabling it to bind a new Sir complex. Subsequent cycles of this process lead to the sequential propagation of the Sir complex along an array of nucleosomes. Such a stepwise (nucleosome-by-nucleosome) spreading model for Sir complexes implies that a continuous array of closely spaced nucleosomes is needed. This is supported by our finding that disrupting the regularity of nucleosomes by nucleosome-excluding structures blocks the spread of silent chromatin (26.Bi X. Yu Q. Sandmeier J.J. Zou Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2118-2131Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The above mechanism for Sir complex propagation provides a paradigm (in the opposite sense) for the spreading model for long range HAT action. Because histone deacetylation is essential to the formation of transcriptionally silent chromatin, a HAT might counteract silencing if it is directed to the silenced domain. This has been proven to be the case as targeting either the HAT Gcn5p or Esa1p in between a silencer and a reporter prevented the silencing of the reporter (27.Chiu Y.H. Yu Q. Sandmeier J.J. Bi X. Genetics. 2003; 165: 115-125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Donze D. Kamakaka R.T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 520-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Therefore, a tethered HAT apparently functioned as a barrier to block the spread of silencing emanating from the silencer. Moreover, we showed, surprisingly, that Gcn5p or Esa1p could counteract silencing even when targeted at a site that was outside the region bracketed by the silencer and reporter (27.Chiu Y.H. Yu Q. Sandmeier J.J. Bi X. Genetics. 2003; 165: 115-125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, the long distance anti-silencing function of tethered LexA-Gcn5p or LexA-Esa1p coincided with the creation of a sizable (>2 kb) chromatin domain with elevated acetylation of histone H3 or H4 that spanned the target site (27.Chiu Y.H. Yu Q. Sandmeier J.J. Bi X. Genetics. 2003; 165: 115-125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was not clear whether the tethered LexA-HAT employed the looping or spreading mechanism to acetylate nucleosomes at a distance from its target site. Concerning the anti-silencing function of HATs, it is thought that elevated acetylation of histones would evict the Sir proteins thereby disrupting silent chromatin structure characterized by densely and stably positioned nucleosomes (29.Ravindra A. Weiss K. Simpson R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7944-7950Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 30.Reimer S.K. Buchman A.R. Chromosoma. 1997; 106: 136-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 31.Weiss K. Simpson R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5392-5403Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, this has not been experimentally tested. In this report we investigated how targeted HATs create extended regions of histone hyperacetylation and counteract transcriptional silencing at a distance and analyzed changes in silent chromatin induced by the HATs. We obtained evidence in accord with the spreading model for long range HAT function. We also found that targeted HATs did not induce significant changes in the Sir-dependent silent chromatin structure pertaining to the profile of nucleosome distribution along the DNA and the abundance of Sir proteins associated with chromatin. These results are not consistent with the all-or-none model for the state of silent chromatin but instead suggest that HATs tethered to silent loci create a state of chromatin different from the “fully silent” (hypoacetylated and Sir-associated) and “fully activated” (acetylated and Sir-free) chromatin. Plasmids—Plasmids pXB323, pXB301, and pRQ12 encoding LexA, LexA-Esa1p, and LexA-Gcn5p, respectively, have been described previously (27.Chiu Y.H. Yu Q. Sandmeier J.J. Bi X. Genetics. 2003; 165: 115-125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid pAR61 contains the HindIII-BamHI fragment of chromosome III (coordinates 14,838–16,263). The 1.1-kb BglII-URA3-BglII fragment of plasmid pFL44 (32.Chevallier M.R. Bloch J.C. Lacroute F. Gene. 1980; 11: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) was inserted at the EcoRV site of pAR61 to make plasmid pMB22-a. Four tandem copies of the ColE1 operator was inserted at the EagI site of pMB22-a to make plasmid pXB306 (27.Chiu Y.H. Yu Q. Sandmeier J.J. Bi X. Genetics. 2003; 165: 115-125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Each ColE1 operator consists of two LexA-binding sites. A 388-bp XmaI-NogMIV fragment of bacterial origin from the plasmid pBLUESCRIPT was inserted at the NgoMIV site of pXB306 making pYC20. A 190-bp sequence containing (CCGNN)16 (n = A/G/C/T) and a 340-bp sequence containing two copies of (T)80 were inserted at the NgoMIV site of pXB306 making plasmids pYZ73 and pYZ72, respectively. The sequence of (CCGNN)16 has been described before (26.Bi X. Yu Q. Sandmeier J.J. Zou Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2118-2131Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Yeast Strains—S. cerevisiae strains used in this study were derived from YXB76 (MATa ura3–52 leu2–3,112 ade2–1 lys1–1 his5–2 can1–100 E-HML-Iinverted) (33.Bi X. Braunstein M. Shei G.J. Broach J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11934-11939Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Strain c carrying the construct near the inverted HML-I as shown in Fig. 1A has been described before (27.Chiu Y.H. Yu Q. Sandmeier J.J. Bi X. Genetics. 2003; 165: 115-125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Strains c1 and c2 were derived from c by replacing the open reading frames of SIR3 and SAS2, respectively, with kanMX. Strains h and h1–h3 were made by transforming YXB76 to Ura+ with HindIII and BamHI-digested plasmids pXB306, pYC20, pYZ73, and pYZ72, respectively. Strains c′ and c″ were made by transforming strain c to being Geneticin-resistant with a PCR-produced fragment encoding 9-Myc linked to kanMX embedded in a sequence spanning the 3′ region of the SIR3 and SIR2 open reading frames, respectively. The relevant genotypes of all strains were verified by Southern blotting. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—ChIP was carried out as described (27.Chiu Y.H. Yu Q. Sandmeier J.J. Bi X. Genetics. 2003; 165: 115-125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sequences of PCR primers used in ChIP are available upon request. Chromatin Analysis with Micrococcal Nuclease—Spheroplasts were made from ∼1 × 109 log phase cells using zymolyase and were permeabilized with Nonidet P-40. MNase was used at 150 and 300 units/ml, respectively, to treat 2 × 108 spheroplasts at 37 °C for 5 min. DNA was then isolated and digested with EagI (Fig. 2C), AvaII (Fig. 4B), or NgoMIV (Fig. 4C). DNA samples were subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis and Southern blotting. Relevant fragments were detected by probes shown in Figs. 2A and 4A, respectively.FIGURE 4Effects of targeted HATs on silent chromatin structure. A, diagram of sequences near HML-I in strains c or c1 examined by chromatin mapping. The filled bars a and b indicated the DNA probes used in B and C, respectively. B, shown are results of MNase digestion and indirect end labeling on strain c (SIR+) (lanes 1–3) and c1 (Δsir3) (lanes 1′–3′) bearing LexA, LexA-Esa1p, and LexA-Gcn5p, respectively. Permeabilized cells were treated with MNase at 150 units/ml, a condition that had been experimentally predetermined to be able to clearly reveal MNase-sensitive sites in a broad region. DNA was isolated and digested with AvaII. An aliquot of permeabilized cells of each strain that were not treated by MNase was used to isolate naked DNA that was then treated with 7.5 units/ml of MNase and digested with AvaII. This sample was designated N (for strain c) or N′ (for c1). DNA samples were subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis and Southern blotting. Relevant DNA fragments were detected by probe a (200 bp) near the AvaII site as shown in A. The relative positions of HML-I, URA3, and LexA sites are shown on the left. Bands uniquely salient in lanes 1–3 but not 1′–3′ are indicated by dots, whereas bands present in lanes 1′–3′ but not 1–3 are indicated by diamonds. C, results from an experiment identical to that in B except that the restriction enzyme used was NgoMIV, and the probe used was b near the NgoMIV site. Note that results in B focused on HML-I and the region between HML-I and URA3, whereas those in C focused on the URA3 sequence.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Tethered Gcn5p Leads to Elevated Acetylation of Not Only Histone H3 but Also Histone H4 in a Sizable Region—In our previous work on the anti-silencing effect of targeted HATs, we used strain c in which the URA3 reporter gene was inserted near the HML-I silencer and two tandem LexA-binding sites were inserted 3′ to URA3 (Fig. 1A) (27.Chiu Y.H. Yu Q. Sandmeier J.J. Bi X. Genetics. 2003; 165: 115-125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The URA3 product can convert 5-fluoroorotic acid (FOA) into a toxic product thus rendering cells sensitive to FOA (34.Boeke J.D. Trueheart J. Natsoulis G. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 164-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar). Therefore, URA3 silencing can be measured by FOA resistance of the cell. URA3 was silenced in strain c bearing LexA (Fig. 1B, growth of strain c bearing LexA on –Leu+FOA medium) (27.Chiu Y.H. Yu Q. Sandmeier J.J. Bi X. Genetics. 2003; 165: 115-125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As predicted, URA3 silencing was Sir-dependent, because it was abolished by deleting SIR3 (Fig. 1B, lack of growth of strain c1 bearing LexA). The LexA-Esa1p or LexA-Gcn5p fusion proteins abolished URA3 silencing in strain c thus exhibiting anti-silencing activity (Fig. 1B, strain c bearing LexA-Esa1p or LexA-Gcn5p). When the LexA-binding sites were deleted from strain c, LexA-Esa1p or LexA-Gcn5p did not have any effect on the silencing of URA3 (27.Chiu Y.H. Yu Q. Sandmeier J.J. Bi X. Genetics. 2003; 165: 115-125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that LexA-Esa1p or -Gcn5p overcame silencing only when they were tethered near the silent region. To examine the mechanism(s) underlying the anti-silencing function of tethered HATs, we tested the spreading model for HAT function, which proposes that local acetylation carried out by a targeted HAT serves to recruit additional HATs (10.Bulger M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21689-21692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 11.Forsberg E.C. Bresnick E.H. BioEssays. 2001; 23: 820-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In this model, the incoming HATs may or may not have the same substrate (histone) specificity as the tethered HAT. This implies that targeting a histone H3-specific HAT might recruit one or more H4-specific HAT(s) to chromatin, and vice versa. Consequently, a targeted HAT regardless of its substrate specificity might generate a region of both H3 and H4 hyperacetylation. This could be tested by simultaneously examining the profiles of acetylation of both histones H3 and H4 around the targeted HAT. We measured the acetylation of both H3 and H4 in a region of ∼2.6 kb encompassing URA3 and the LexA-binding sites in strain c bearing LexA-Gcn5p by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with antibodies against acetylated H3 (α-H3-Ac) or acetylated H4 (α-H4-Ac) (Fig. 1C). Strain c bearing LexA was examined as a control. PCR primers were designed to detect DNA fragments 1–9 (200–450 bp in length) in immunoprecipitated DNA (Fig. 1A). PCR products corresponding to these fragments were examined by agarose gel electrophoresis. Three independent ChIP experiments (on independent cultures of each strain) were performed, and a representative gel picture is presented (Fig. 1C, left). The intensity of each band was quantified and normalized against input control. LexA-Gcn5p-induced acetylation in a particular sequence (1.Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J.

FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 124-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar) was estimated as the ratio of the intensity of the corresponding fragment in LexA-Gcn5p-expressing cells over that in LexA-expressing cells, and the mean of data from all the repeats (together with standard deviation) was graphed in the right panel of Fig. 1C. Also included as controls were results for the ACT1 and TDH3 loci that were not associated with LexA-Gcn5p. Tethered LexA-Gcn5p increased H3 acetylation 1.5- to 3-fold in a region of ∼2kb spanning the LexA sites (Fig. 1C, right panel, 2–9, H3-Ac bars). This was consistent with results from our previous experiments (27.Chiu Y.H. Yu Q. Sandmeier J.J. Bi X. Genetics. 2003; 165: 115-125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but the -fold increase in H3 acetylation detected here was lower, perhaps because α-H3-Ac from a different source was used. In general, LexA-Gcn5p also increased histone H4 acetylation in the same region where H3 acetylation was elevated (Fig. 1C, right panel, 2–9, H4-Ac bars). Therefore, targeted Gcn5p induced the acetylation of not only histones H3 but also histone H4 in a sizable region. It is possible that, although native Gcn5p prefers histone H3 as substrate for acetylation (12.Carrozza M.J. Utley R.T. Workman J.L. Cote J. Trends Genet. 2003; 19: 321-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar), tethered LexA-fused Gcn5p might have an expanded spectrum of substrates that includes histone H4. An alternative explanation is that histone H3 acetylated by LexA-Gcn5p may help recruit one or more histone H4-specific HATs. The two known H4 HATs in yeast are Esa1p and Sas2p (12.Carrozza M.J. Utley R.T. Workman J.L. Cote J. Trends Genet. 2003; 19: 321-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). We wondered whether Esa1p or Sas2p was involved in the function of tethered Gcn5p. We showed that deletion of SAS2 had no significant effect on the long range anti-silencing function of tethered Gcn5p or Esa1p (Fig. 1B, strain c2, compare LexA-Gcn5p or -Esa1p to LexA). Therefore, SAS2 is not required for the anti-silencing function of targeted Gcn5p. Because ESA1 is essential for cell growth, it was not possible to use deletion analysis to test if ESA1 is required for the function of tethered Gcn5p. We also measured the acetylation of both histones H3 and H4 around the LexA-binding sites in strain c bearing LexA-Esa1p. As predicted, LexA-Esa1p increased histone H4 acetylation in a region of ∼2.6 kb encompassing the LexA sites (Fig. 1D, right, 1–9, H4-Ac bars). Acetylation of histone H3, however, was not elevated in this region except for a 2-fold increase at 2- and a 1.5-fold increase at 9 (Fig. 1D, right panel, H3-Ac bars at 4 and 9). Therefore, unlike LexA-Gcn5p, LexA-Esa1p only induced acetylation of histone H4 but not H3 in a broad region. One possible explanation was that histone H4 acetylation by LexA-Esa1p only helps recruit additional H4-specific HATs. We note that the apparent increase in acetylation of histones induced by tethered LexA-Gcn5p or -Esa1p as described above might also have been the result of a change in the density and distribution of nucleosomes. However, this was unlikely, because we showed that LexA-Esa1p or -Gcn5p did not induce detectable changes in the primary chromatin structure pertaining to the density and distribution of nucleosomes in the region between HML-I and the LexA sites in strain c (see Fig. 4 and corresponding descriptions in a later part under “Results”). Long Distance Anti-silencing Function of a Tethered HAT Can Be Blocked by Nucleosome-excluding Sequences—In the spreading model for long distance HAT function, nucleosomes not only are the substrates but also serve to recruit HATs (10.Bulger M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21689-21692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 11.Forsberg E.C. Bresnick E.H. BioEssays. 2001; 23: 820-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Therefore, a nucleosome-free region should hinder the putative spread of HAT complexes and histone acetylation. To test this, we examined the effect of known nucleosome-excluding sequences (CCGNN)n (n = A/G/C/T) and poly-(dA:dT) (26.Bi X. Yu Q. Sandmeier J.J. Zou Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2118-2131Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 35.Simpson R.T. Kunzler P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 6: 1387-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 36.Wang Y.H.

Strain h was identical to strain c except that LexA-binding sites were located farther (1.7 kb) from the URA3 promoter (Fig. 2A) (27.Chiu Y.H. Yu Q. Sandmeier J.J. Bi X.
