https://openalex.org/W3182978015,"Widespread acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines is crucial for achieving sufficient immunization coverage to end the global pandemic, yet few studies have investigated COVID-19 vaccination attitudes in lower-income countries, where large-scale vaccination is just beginning. We analyze COVID-19 vaccine acceptance across 15 survey samples covering 10 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) in Asia, Africa and South America, Russia (an upper-middle-income country) and the United States, including a total of 44,260 individuals. We find considerably higher willingness to take a COVID-19 vaccine in our LMIC samples (mean 80.3%; median 78%; range 30.1 percentage points) compared with the United States (mean 64.6%) and Russia (mean 30.4%). Vaccine acceptance in LMICs is primarily explained by an interest in personal protection against COVID-19, while concern about side effects is the most common reason for hesitancy. Health workers are the most trusted sources of guidance about COVID-19 vaccines. Evidence from this sample of LMICs suggests that prioritizing vaccine distribution to the Global South should yield high returns in advancing global immunization coverage. Vaccination campaigns should focus on translating the high levels of stated acceptance into actual uptake. Messages highlighting vaccine efficacy and safety, delivered by healthcare workers, could be effective for addressing any remaining hesitancy in the analyzed LMICs."
https://openalex.org/W3182247580,"According to the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, medical teleconsultations using various technologies have become an important tool to mediate communication between general practitioners (GP) and the patients in primary health care in many countries. The quality of the GP-patient communication is an essential factor, which improves the results of treatment and patient satisfaction. The objective of this paper is to study patients’ satisfaction from teleconsultation in primary care and the impact of teleconsultations on GP-patient communication through the Covid-19 pandemic in Poland. We analyse whether the teleconsultations performed without physical examinations have a positive impact on GP-patient communication. The quality of teleconsultation and GP-patient communication have been measured using a questionnaire regarding the quality of medical care in a remote care conditions. Among 36 items, nine questions have been related to the dimension of GP-patient communication and ten to system experience. Our results suggest that the quality of teleconsultations is not inferior to the quality of consultation during a face-to-face visit. The patients indicated a high level of satisfaction regarding communication with their GP during teleconsultation. We have also identified that the technical quality and the sense of comfort during teleconsultation positively impact the communication quality."

In this work, tobacco residues were pyrolyzed in an ablative reactor under vacuum. The maximum bio-oil yield of 55% w/w was obtained at 600°C with a particle size of 10 mm at a blade rotation speed of 10 rpm. The physical properties of the products showed that the oil produced was of high quality with high carbon, hydrogen, and calorific value. Two-dimensional gas chromatography/time-of-flight mass spectrometric analysis results indicated that the oils were complex mixtures of alkanes, benzene derivative groups, and nitrogen-containing compounds. In addition, 13C NMR results confirmed that long aliphatic chain alkanes were evident. The alkanes were likely converted from furans that were decomposed from hemicelluloses. Ablative pyrolysis under vacuum proved to be a promising option for generating useful amount of bio-oils from tobacco residues."

However, whether and how Dex affects breast cancer metastasis remain to be furtherly understood. In this study, we established several mouse breast cancer metastatic models to study the effect of Dex in vitro and in vivo. Transwell, Western Blot and RNA interference were applied to study the molecular mechanism of Dex in promoting breast cancer cell migration. Meanwhile, the effect of Dex on lung metastasis of breast cancer in Dex combined with PTX chemotherapy was discussed. Our results confirmed that Dex could promote breast cancer cell metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistic studies revealed that this pro-metastatic effect of Dex was mediated by the GR-PI3K-SGK1-CTGF pathway in tumor cells. Ligation of Dex and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) on tumor cells activated the PI3K signaling pathway and upregulated serum glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 (SGK1) expression, and then increased the expression of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) through Nedd4l-Smad2. Moreover, Dex was the leading factor for lung metastasis in a standard regimen for breast cancer treatment with paclitaxel and Dex. Importantly, targeting SGK1 with the inhibitor GSK650394 remarkably reduced lung metastasis in this regimen. Our present data provide new insights into Dex-induced breast cancer metastasis and indicate that SGK1 could be a candidate target for the treatment of breast cancer metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W3181260403,"Abstract Targeting androgen signaling with the second-generation anti-androgen drugs, such as enzalutamide (Enza), abiraterone (Abi), apalutamide (Apal), and darolutamide (Daro), is the mainstay for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). While these treatments are effective initially, resistance occurs frequently. Continued expression of androgen receptor (AR) and its variants such as AR-V7 despite AR-targeted therapy contributes to treatment resistance and cancer progression in advanced CRPC patients. This highlights the need for new strategies blocking continued AR signaling. Here, we identify a novel AR/AR-V7 degrader (ARVib) and found that ARVib effectively degrades AR/AR-V7 protein and attenuates AR/AR-V7 downstream target gene expression in prostate cancer cells. Mechanistically, ARVib degrades AR/AR-V7 protein through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway mediated by HSP70/STUB1 machinery modulation. ARVib suppresses HSP70 expression and promotes STUB1 nuclear translocation, where STUB1 binds to AR/AR-V7 and promotes its ubiquitination and degradation. ARVib significantly inhibits resistant prostate tumor growth and improves enzalutamide treatment in vitro and in vivo. These data suggest that ARVib has potential for development as an AR/AR-V7 degrader to treat resistant CRPC."
https://openalex.org/W3180109413,"Pneumatically-actuated soft robots have advantages over traditional rigid robots in many applications. In particular, their flexible bodies and gentle air-powered movements make them more suitable for use around humans and other objects that could be injured or damaged by traditional robots. However, existing systems for controlling soft robots currently require dedicated electromechanical hardware (usually solenoid valves) to maintain the actuation state (expanded or contracted) of each independent actuator. When combined with power, computation, and sensing components, this control hardware adds considerable cost, size, and power demands to the robot, thereby limiting the feasibility of soft robots in many important application areas. In this work, we introduce a pneumatic memory that uses air (not electricity) to set and maintain the states of large numbers of soft robotic actuators without dedicated electromechanical hardware. These pneumatic logic circuits use normally-closed microfluidic valves as transistor-like elements; this enables our circuits to support more complex computational functions than those built from normally-open valves. We demonstrate an eight-bit nonvolatile random-access pneumatic memory (RAM) that can maintain the states of multiple actuators, control both individual actuators and multiple actuators simultaneously using a pneumatic version of time division multiplexing (TDM), and set actuators to any intermediate position using a pneumatic version of analog-to-digital conversion. We perform proof-of-concept experimental testing of our pneumatic RAM by using it to control soft robotic hands playing individual notes, chords, and songs on a piano keyboard. By dramatically reducing the amount of hardware required to control multiple independent actuators in pneumatic soft robots, our pneumatic RAM can accelerate the spread of soft robotic technologies to a wide range of important application areas."
https://openalex.org/W3177772206,"As the COVID-19 pandemic drags into its second year, there is hope on the horizon, in the form of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines which promise disease suppression and a return to pre-pandemic normalcy. In this study we critically examine the basis for that hope, using an epidemiological modeling framework to establish the link between vaccine characteristics and effectiveness in bringing an end to this unprecedented public health crisis. Our findings suggest that a return to pre-pandemic social and economic conditions without fully suppressing SARS-CoV-2 will lead to extensive viral spread, resulting in a high disease burden even in the presence of vaccines that reduce risk of infection and mortality. Our modeling points to the feasibility of complete SARS-CoV-2 suppression with high population-level compliance and vaccines that are highly effective at reducing SARS-CoV-2 infection. Notably, vaccine-mediated reduction of transmission is critical for viral suppression, and in order for partially-effective vaccines to play a positive role in SARS-CoV-2 suppression, complementary biomedical interventions and public health measures must be deployed simultaneously."
https://openalex.org/W3181458096,"Anemia remains an important global health problem. Inexpensive, accurate, and noninvasive solutions are needed to monitor and evaluate anemia in resource-limited settings. We evaluated the performance of multiple point-of-care hemoglobin devices, including a novel noninvasive smartphone application tested on Apple® and Android® cell phones, Masimo Pronto®, and HemoCue® Hb-301 and Hb-801, against a gold-standard hematology analyzer (reference hemoglobin) using venous blood. We examined correlations between hemoglobin devices and reference hemoglobin, device accuracy (average bias, Bland-Altman plots, clinical performance) and classification bias (sensitivity, specificity) among 299 refugees (10mo-65y) in Atlanta, GA. Semi-structured interviews (n = 19) with participants and staff assessed usability and acceptability. Mean reference hemoglobin was 13.7 g/dL (SD:1.8) with 12.5% anemia. Noninvasive hemoglobin devices were not well correlated with reference hemoglobin (Apple® R2 = 0.08, Android® R2 = 0.11, Masimo Pronto® R2 = 0.29), but stronger correlations were reported with HemoCue® Hb-301 (R2 = 0.87) and Hb-801 (R2 = 0.88). Bias (SD) varied across each device: Apple®: -1.6 g/dL (2.0), Android®: -0.7 g/dL (2.0), Masimo Pronto®: -0.4 g/dL (1.6), HemoCue® Hb-301: +0.4 g/dL (0.7) and HemoCue® Hb-801: +0.2 g/dL (0.6). Clinically acceptable performance (within ± 1 g/dL of reference hemoglobin) was higher for the invasive devices (HemoCue® Hb-301: 90.3%; HemoCue® Hb-801: 93.4%) compared to noninvasive devices (Apple®: 31.5%; Android®: 34.6%; Masimo Pronto®: 49.5%). Sensitivity and specificity were 63.9% and 48.2% for Apple®, 36.1% and 67.6% for Android®, 45.7% and 85.3% for Masimo Pronto®, 54.3% and 97.6% for HemoCue® Hb-301, and 66.7% and 97.6% for HemoCue® Hb-801. Noninvasive devices were considered easy to use and were the preferred method by participants. Among the only studies to compare multiple point-of-care approaches to hemoglobin testing, the diagnostic ability of HemoCue® was comparable to reference hemoglobin, while noninvasive devices had high user acceptability but considerable biases. Improvements in noninvasive device performance and further testing in anemic populations are recommended before broader use."
https://openalex.org/W3180644866,"Microbially Induced Carbonate Precipitation (MICP) is currently viewed as one of the potential prominent processes for field applications towards the prevention of soil erosion, healing cracks in bricks, and groundwater contamination. Typically, the bacteria involved in MICP manipulate their environment leading to calcite precipitation with an enzyme such as urease, causing calcite crystals to form on the surface of grains forming cementation bonds between particles that help in reducing soil permeability and increase overall compressive strength. In this paper, the main focus is to study the MICP performance of three indigenous landfill bacteria against a well-known commercially bought MICP bacteria (Bacillus megaterium) using sand columns. In order to check the viability of the method for potential field conditions, the tests were carried out at slightly less favourable environmental conditions, i.e., at temperatures between 15-17°C and without the addition of urease enzymes. Furthermore, the sand was loose without any compaction to imitate real ground conditions. The results showed that the indigenous bacteria yielded similar permeability reduction (4.79 E-05 to 5.65 E-05) and calcium carbonate formation (14.4-14.7%) to the control bacteria (Bacillus megaterium), which had permeability reduction of 4.56 E-5 and CaCO3 of 13.6%. Also, reasonably good unconfined compressive strengths (160-258 kPa) were noted for the indigenous bacteria samples (160 kPa). SEM and XRD showed the variation of biocrystals formation mainly detected as Calcite and Vaterite. Overall, all of the indigenous bacteria performed slightly better than the control bacteria in strength, permeability, and CaCO3 precipitation. In retrospect, this study provides clear evidence that the indigenous bacteria in such environments can provide similar calcite precipitation potential as well-documented bacteria from cell culture banks. Hence, the idea of MICP field application through biostimulation of indigenous bacteria rather than bioaugmentation can become a reality in the near future."
https://openalex.org/W3181374437,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor δ (PPARδ) is a nuclear receptor transcription factor that plays an important role in the regulation of metabolism, inflammation, and cancer. In addition, the nutrient-sensing kinase 5'AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a critical regulator of cellular energy in coordination with PPARδ. However, the molecular mechanism of the AMPK/PPARδ pathway on cancer progression is still unclear. Here, we found that activated AMPK induced PPARδ-S50 phosphorylation in cancer cells, whereas the PPARδ/S50A (nonphosphorylation mimic) mutant reversed this event. Further analysis showed that the PPARδ/S50E (phosphorylation mimic) but not the PPARδ/S50A mutant increased PPARδ protein stability, which led to reduced p62/SQSTM1-mediated degradation of misfolded PPARδ. Furthermore, PPARδ-S50 phosphorylation decreased PPARδ transcription activity and alleviated PPARδ-mediated uptake of glucose and glutamine in cancer cells. Soft agar and xenograft tumor model analysis showed that the PPARδ/S50E mutant but not the PPARδ/S50A mutant inhibited colon cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth, which was associated with inhibition of Glut1 and SLC1A5 transporter protein expression. These findings reveal a new mechanism of AMPK-induced PPARδ-S50 phosphorylation, accumulation of misfolded PPARδ protein, and inhibition of PPARδ transcription activity contributing to the suppression of colon tumor formation."
https://openalex.org/W3177715097,"Signaling of semaphorin ligands via their plexin-neuropilin receptors is involved in tissue patterning in the developing embryo. These proteins play roles in cell migration and adhesion but are also important in disease etiology, including in cancer angiogenesis and metastasis. While some structures of the soluble domains of these receptors have been determined, the conformations of the full-length receptor complexes are just beginning to be elucidated, especially within the context of the plasma membrane. Pulsed-interleaved excitation fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy allows direct insight into the formation of protein-protein interactions in the membranes of live cells. Here, we investigated the homodimerization of neuropilin-1 (Nrp1), plexin A2, plexin A4, and plexin D1 using pulsed-interleaved excitation fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy. Consistent with previous studies, we found that Nrp1, plexin A2, and plexin A4 are present as dimers in the absence of exogenous ligand. Plexin D1, on the other hand, was monomeric under similar conditions, which had not been previously reported. We also found that plexin A2 and A4 assemble into a heteromeric complex. Stimulation with semaphorin 3A or semaphorin 3C neither disrupts nor enhances the dimerization of the receptors when expressed alone, suggesting that activation involves a conformational change rather than a shift in the monomer-dimer equilibrium. However, upon stimulation with semaphorin 3C, plexin D1 and Nrp1 form a heteromeric complex. This analysis of interactions provides a complementary approach to the existing structural and biochemical data that will aid in the development of new therapeutic strategies to target these receptors in cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3179019500,"With the continued rise of the global incidence of COVID-19 infection and emergent second wave, the need to understand characteristics that impact susceptibility to infection, clinical severity, and outcomes remains vital. The objective of this study was to assess modifying effects of demographic factors on COVID-19 testing status and outcomes in a large, diverse single health system cohort. The Mount Sinai Health System de-identified COVID-19 database contained records of 39,539 patients entering the health system from 02/28/2020 to 06/08/2020 with 7,032 laboratory-confirmed cases. The prevalence of qRT-PCR nasopharyngeal swabs (χ 2 = 665.7, p&lt;0.0001) and case rates (χ 2 = 445.3, p&lt;0.0001) are highest in Hispanics and Black or African Americans. The likelihood of admission and/or presentation to an intensive care unit (ICU) versus non-ICU inpatient unit, emergency department, and outpatient services, which reflects the severity of the clinical course, was also modified by race and ethnicity. Females were less likely to be tested [Relative Risk(RR) = 1.121, p&lt;0.0001], and males had a higher case prevalence (RR = 1.224, p&lt;0.001). Compared to other major ethnic groups, Whites experienced a higher prevalence of mortality (p&lt;0.05). Males experienced a higher risk of mortality (RR = 1.180, p = 0.0012) at relatively younger ages (70.58±11.75) compared to females (73.02±11.46) (p = 0.0004). There was an increased severity of disease in older patient populations of both sexes. Although Hispanic and Black or African American race was associated with higher testing prevalence and positive testing rates, the only disparity with respect to mortality was a higher prevalence in Whites."
https://openalex.org/W3178549207,"The purpose of this study was to clarify the histological effect of reducing the loading to knee on cartilage degeneration, osteophyte formation, and synovitis in early-stage osteoarthritis (OA) using a post-traumatic rat model. Ten male rats were randomly allocated into two experimental groups: OA induction by surgical destabilization of medial meniscus (DMM, OA group) and hindlimb suspension after OA induction by DMM (OAHS group). The articular cartilage, osteophyte formation, and synovial membrane in the medial tibiofemoral joint were analyzed histologically and histomorphometrically at 2 and 4 weeks after surgery. The histological scores and changes in articular cartilage and osteophyte formation were significantly milder and slower in the OAHS group than in the OA group. At 2 and 4 weeks, there were no significant differences in cartilage thickness and matrix staining intensity between both the groups, but chondrocytes density was significantly lower in the OA group. Synovitis was milder in OAHS group than in OA group at 2 weeks. Reducing knee joint loading inhibited histological OA changes in articular cartilage, osteophyte formation, and synovial inflammation. This result supports the latest clinical guidelines for OA treatment. Further studies using biochemical and mechanical analyses are necessary to elucidate the mechanism underlying delayed OA progression caused by joint-load reduction."
https://openalex.org/W3182807963,"Transcription factors (TFs) harboring broad-complex, tramtrack, and bric-a-brac (BTB) domains play important roles in development and disease. These BTB domains are thought to recruit transcriptional modulators to target DNA regions. However, a systematic molecular understanding of the mechanism of action of this TF family is lacking. Here, we identify the zinc finger BTB-TF Zbtb2 from a genetic screen for regulators of exit from pluripotency and demonstrate that its absence perturbs embryonic stem cell differentiation and the gene expression dynamics underlying peri-implantation development. We show that ZBTB2 binds the chromatin remodeler Ep400 to mediate downstream transcription. Independently, the BTB domain directly interacts with nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase and histone chaperone histone regulator A. Nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase recruitment is a common feature of BTB TFs, and based on phylogenetic analysis, we propose that this is a conserved evolutionary property. Binding to UBN2, in contrast, is specific to ZBTB2 and requires a C-terminal extension of the BTB domain.

Many TFs present a modular protein architecture containing DNA-binding domains and domains that interact with transcriptional activators or repressors (1Lambert S.A. Jolma A. Campitelli L.F. Das P.K.

Zinc-finger (Znf) domains are the most common family of DNA-binding domains and are often found in combination with Kruppel-associated box or broad-complex, tramtrack, and bric-a-brac (BTB) domains (3Collins T.

In contrast, there is no comprehensive understanding of the transcriptional role of BTB domains. There are three groups of TFs containing BTB domains (BTB TFs): the Zbtb, the Bach, and the Nacc families. They are defined by their DNA-binding domains: Znf for Zbtb, bZIP for Bach, and BEN for Nacc (5Stogios P.J. Downs G.S. Jauhal J.J. Nandra S.K. Privé G.G. Sequence and structural analysis of BTB domain proteins.Genome Biol. 2005; 6R82Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In human and mouse, the Bach and the Nacc families contain only two members each, and the Zbtb family comprises 49 members. Several of them are critical regulators of fate allocation and differentiation across many organs and systems (6Chevrier S. Corcoran L.M. BTB-ZF transcription factors, a growing family of regulators of early and late B-cell development.Immunol. Cell Biol. 2014; 92: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). A striking example is hematopoiesis, in which BTB TFs direct the differentiation of several lineages (7Maeda T. Regulation of hematopoietic development by ZBTB transcription factors.Int. J. Hematol. 2016; 104: 310-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The BTB domains are invariably found at the N terminus of BTB TFs and the DNA-binding domains at the C terminus, separated by a long nonconserved linker region (7Maeda T. Regulation of hematopoietic development by ZBTB transcription factors.Int. J. Hematol. 2016; 104: 310-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Although BTB domains function in homo- and hetero-dimerization and protein–protein interactions, the BTB domains found in TFs and CUL3 ubiquitin ligases constitute separate families (5Stogios P.J. Downs G.S. Jauhal J.J. Nandra S.K. Privé G.G. Sequence and structural analysis of BTB domain proteins.Genome Biol. 2005; 6R82Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mechanistic studies of ZBTB factors have focused on the proto-oncogenes Bcl6 (Zbtb27) and Lrf (Zbtb7a) and on the tumor suppressor Plzf (Zbtb16) and found that they act as transcriptional repressors via the recruitment of complexes such as nuclear receptor corepressor/silencing mediator of retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptor (NCOR/SMRT), BCL6 corepressor (BCOR), SIN3 transcription regulator family member A/B (SIN3A/B), and nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) (7Maeda T.

Mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) are a developmentally relevant cell type that captures the pluripotent state of the preimplantation mouse epiblast and that recapitulates developmental progression upon release into differentiation in vitro (8Martello G. Smith A. The nature of embryonic stem cells.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2014; 30: 647-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a large number of genomic datasets have been derived from mESCs, making them an ideal model for mechanistic studies of transcription. mESCs are maintained by provision of the cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) in a fetal calf serum–containing medium (Serum-LIF) (9Smith A.G.

The histone regulator A (HiRA) complex acts as the H3.3 histone chaperone at euchromatic loci (26Goldberg A.D. Banaszynski L.A. Noh K.-M. Lewis P.W. Elsaesser S.J. Stadler S. Dewell S. Law M. Guo X.

Euchromatic H3.3 is found in H2A.Z-containing nucleosomes (30Jin C. Felsenfeld G.

Cell. 2016; 61: 27-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), yet if and how Ep400 interacts with H3.3 chaperones is unclear. HiRA is required for exit from the naïve pluripotency during differentiation (32Leeb M. Dietmann S. Paramor M. Niwa H. Smith A. Genetic exploration of the exit from self-renewal using haploid embryonic stem cells.Cell Stem Cell. 2014; 14: 385-393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), while the Ep400 complex is essential for the maintenance of mESCs (33Fazzio T.G.

Here, we identify the BTB-TF Zbtb2 in a genetic screen for regulators of exit from mESC pluripotency and report a detailed mechanistic analysis of its function, showing that ZBTB2 recruits ZNF639, MBD3-NuRD, UBN2-HiRA, and the Ep400 complex. Transcriptome analysis reveals that ZBTB2 interactors form two functionally distinct modules, one encompassing ZNF639, NuRD, and HiRA and the other corresponding to the Ep400 complex. We show that NuRD and HiRA associate with ZBTB2 via the subunits GATAD2A/B and UBN2, respectively. We systematically test these interactions across all BTB TFs in yeast-2-hybrid (Y2H) screens. We find that ZBTB2 harbors an extension of the BTB domain that mediates a unique interaction with UBN2. GATAD2A/B interaction is instead a common feature of BTB TFs and shared across several BTB-TF phylogenetic branches, making NuRD recruitment a candidate ancestral feature of TF-associated BTB domains. Our study therefore reveals unique and shared molecular functions of the BTB domain TF family. We performed a sensitized genetic screen for maintenance of pluripotency in the presence of the GSK3i CHIR99021 (CHIR) (34Sato N. Meijer L. Skaltsounis L. Greengard P. Brivanlou A.H.

The ground state of pluripotency.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2010; 38: 1027-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). As the role of CHIR in mESC maintenance is well characterized (36Martello G.

We mutagenized haploid mESCs (38Elling U. Taubenschmid J. Wirnsberger G. O’Malley R. Demers S.-P. Vanhaelen Q. Shukalyuk A.I. Schmauss G. Schramek D. Schnuetgen F. von Melchner H. Ecker J.R.

Enhanced gene trapping in mouse embryonic stem cells.Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36e133Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), leading to both loss and gain of function alleles. We cultured the mutagenized library in N2B27 + CHIR + Puromycin to select for undifferentiated cells and harvested the cells after 16 to 23 days. We mapped the insertions by high-throughput inverse PCR and determined insertion enrichment compared with the starting library for every gene (Fig. 1A, Table S1). Confirming the specificity of our setup, Fgfr1 and Lif were among the highest scoring hits. FGFR1 is the main fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor in mESCs and acts upstream of MEK activation (40Molotkov A. Mazot P. Brewer J.R. Cinalli R.M. Soriano P.

Cell. 2017; 41: 511-526.e4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and chemical inhibition of FGFR signaling has been shown to substitute for MEKi in mESC maintenance (10Ying Q.-L.

The ground state of embryonic stem cell self-renewal.Nature. 2008; 453: 519-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (2361) Google Scholar). Lif, evidently a gain of function hit, is also able to sustain pluripotency in combination with CHIR (34Sato N. Meijer L. Skaltsounis L. Greengard P. Brivanlou A.H.

Oct4 is a technical false-positive hit, as it can drive the expression of the Oct4>GFP-puro reporter irrespectively of the cell state. Confidence in our analysis was also bolstered by the identification of Esrrb and Tfcp2l1 among the insertion-depleted genes, as these are transcriptional mediators of CHIR activity (8Martello G.

We therefore decided to validate the hits Zbtb2, Zfp42, Nexmif, and Nmt1. The Nexmif gene lies upstream of the Rlim transcription start site, and RLIM is a known E3 ubiquitin ligase for ZFP42 (47Gontan C. Achame E.M. Demmers J. Barakat T.S. Rentmeester E. van IJcken W. Grootegoed J.A. Gribnau J. RNF12 initiates X-chromosome inactivation by targeting REX1 for degradation.Nature. 2012; 485: 386-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), so we reasoned that the Nexmif insertion enrichment would lead to Rlim overexpression. We therefore generated CRISPR KO clones (Table S2) for Zfp42 (Fig. S1A), Nmt1 (Fig. S1B), and Zbtb2 (Fig. S1C), and Rlim overexpressing cells using naïve TNG-A mESCs, a conventional diploid cell line harboring a Nanog>GFP reporter (48Chambers I. Silva J. Colby D. Nichols J. Nijmeijer B. Robertson M. Vrana J. Jones K. Grotewold L. Smith A. Nanog safeguards pluripotency and mediates germline development.Nature. 2007; 450: 1230-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar). Upon exposure to N2B27 + CHIR, concomitant with the addition of recombinant basic FGF (bFGF) to increase the stringency of the assay, all three mutants and the Rlim-overexpressing cells showed delayed downregulation of the Nanog reporter when compared with WT cells (Fig. 1, B–D, and Fig. S1D), indicating that they are bona fide loss-of-function screen hits. Overexpression of Rlim in the Zfp42 mutant did not modify the phenotype of the Zfp42 single mutant (Fig. 1B and Fig. S1D), supporting the epistatic relationship between Rlim and Zfp42. While Zfp42 overexpression did not affect differentiation (Fig. 1B and Fig. S1D), strong Zbtb2 constitutive overexpression using a CAG promoter caused cell death (not shown). We therefore tested the effect of moderate Zbtb2 overexpression, achieved by a doxycycline (DOX)-inducible promoter, and observed accelerated differentiation upon Zbtb2 induction (Fig. 1D and Fig. S1D). Nmt1 encodes an N-myristoyltransferase (49Yang S.H. Shrivastav A. Kosinski C. Sharma R.K. Chen M.-H. Berthiaume L.G. Peters L.L. Chuang P.-T. Young S.G. Bergo M.O.

Chem. 2005; 280: 18990-18995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and myristoylation is required for the function of FRS2, an essential component for FGFR1 signaling (50Kouhara H.

We therefore speculated that loss of Nmt1 would inhibit mESC differentiation by dampening mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling. However, ERK phosphorylation upon exposure to bFGF was unperturbed in Nmt1−/− cells (Fig. S1E). We therefore turned our attention to another myristoylated protein, LAMTOR1 (51Thinon E. Serwa R.A.

Nichols J. Dietmann S. Corrin P.D. Paddison P.J. Smith A. Exit from pluripotency is gated by intracellular redistribution of the bHLH transcription factor Tfe3.Cell. 2013; 153: 335-347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence staining revealed abnormal nuclear localization of TFE3 in Nmt1−/− mESCs (Fig. 1E), suggesting that ectopically active TFE3 mediates the differentiation delay in the absence of Nmt1. Although Zbtb2 had already been suggested to play a role in the differentiation of Serum-LIF mESCs (54Karemaker I.D. Vermeulen M. ZBTB2 reads unmethylated CpG island promoters and regulates embryonic stem cell differentiation.EMBO Rep. 2018; 19e44993Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), we decided to focus our efforts on this factor in the hope of gaining insights that are broadly applicable to BTB TFs. We first sought to better characterize Zbtb2’s role in the exit from the naïve state and determine when the earliest developmental defect would arise. We first tested differentiation of N2B27 containing LIF, CHIR, and PD0325901 (2iLIF) cells using the EpiLC differentiation protocol, which faithfully mimics the preimplantation to postimplantation epiblast transition (13Hayashi K.

The secondary outcomes were outpatient visits, place of death and hospitalizations, as well as radiotherapy and major surgery. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was used for associations. A moderation variable was added to assess for the effect of SPC at home between the cohorts.Intensity of care at EOL increased over time between the cohorts, especially use of SACT, increased with 10%, p<0.001, (n = 102/754 = 14% to n = 236/972 = 24%), ED visits with 7%, p<0.001, (n = 25/754 = 3% to n = 100/972 = 10%) and ICU care, 2%, p = 0.04, (n = 12/754 = 2% to n = 38/972 = 4%). High intensity of care at EOL were more likely among patients with lung cancer. The difference in use of SACT between the years, was moderated by SPC, with an increase of SACT, unstandardized coefficient β; 0.87, SE = 0.27, p = 0.001, as well as the difference between the years in death at acute care hospitals, that decreased (β = 0.69, SE = 0.26, p = 0.007).These findings underscore an increase of several aspects regarding intensity of care at EOL, and a need for further exploration of the optimal organization of EOL care. Our results indicate fragmentation of care and a need to better organize and coordinate care for vulnerable patients."
https://openalex.org/W3180169797,"The tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) negatively regulates the insulin signaling pathway. Germline PTEN pathogenic variants cause PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome (PHTS), associated with lipoma development in children. Adipose progenitor cells (APCs) lose their capacity to differentiate into adipocytes during continuous culture, whereas APCs from lipomas of patients with PHTS retain their adipogenic potential over a prolonged period. It remains unclear which mechanisms trigger this aberrant adipose tissue growth. To investigate the role of PTEN in adipose tissue development, we performed functional assays and RNA-Seq of control and PTEN knockdown APCs. Reduction of PTEN levels using siRNA or CRISPR led to enhanced proliferation and differentiation of APCs. Forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1) transcriptional activity is known to be regulated by insulin signaling, and FOXO1 was downregulated at the mRNA level while its inactivation through phosphorylation increased. FOXO1 phosphorylation initiates the expression of the lipogenesis-activating transcription factor sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1). SREBP1 levels were higher after PTEN knockdown and may account for the observed enhanced adipogenesis. To validate this, we overexpressed constitutively active FOXO1 in PTEN CRISPR cells and found reduced adipogenesis, accompanied by SREBP1 downregulation. We observed that PTEN CRISPR cells showed less senescence compared with controls and the senescence marker CDKN1A (p21) was downregulated in PTEN knockdown cells. Cellular senescence was the most significantly enriched pathway found in RNA-Seq of PTEN knockdown versus control cells. These results provide evidence that PTEN is involved in the regulation of APC proliferation, differentiation, and senescence, thereby contributing to aberrant adipose tissue growth in patients with PHTS."
https://openalex.org/W3182197846,"Cluster of differentiation-22 (CD22) belongs to the sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin (Ig)-like lectin family of receptors that is expressed on the surface of B cells. It has been classified as an inhibitory coreceptor for the B-cell receptor because of its function in establishing a baseline level of B-cell inhibition. The restricted expression of CD22 on B cells and its inhibitory function make it an attractive target for B-cell depletion in cases of B-cell malignancies. Genetically modified T cells with chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) derived from the m971 antibody have shown promise when used as an immunotherapeutic agent against B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. A key aspect of the efficacy of this CAR-T was its ability to target a membrane-proximal epitope on the CD22 extracellular domain; however, the molecular details of m971 recognition of CD22 have thus far remained elusive. Here, we report the crystal structure of the m971 fragment antigen-binding in complex with the two most membrane-proximal Ig-like domains of CD22 (CD22d6-d7). The m971 epitope on CD22 resides at the most proximal Ig domain (d7) to the membrane, and the antibody paratope contains electrostatic surfaces compatible with interactions with phospholipid head groups. Together, our data identify molecular details underlying the successful transformation of an antibody epitope on CD22 into an effective CAR immunotherapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W3182322685,"Phenol-soluble modulins (PSMs), such as α-PSMs, β-PSMs, and δ-toxin, are virulence peptides secreted by different Staphylococcus aureus strains. PSMs are able to form amyloid fibrils, which may strengthen the biofilm matrix that promotes bacterial colonization of and extended growth on surfaces (e.g., cell tissue) and increases antibiotic resistance. Many components contribute to biofilm formation, including the human-produced highly sulfated glycosaminoglycan heparin. Although heparin promotes S. aureus infection, the molecular basis for this is unclear. Given that heparin is known to induce fibrillation of a wide range of proteins, we hypothesized that heparin aids bacterial colonization by promoting PSM fibrillation. Here, we address this hypothesis using a combination of thioflavin T-fluorescence kinetic studies, CD, FTIR, electron microscopy, and peptide microarrays to investigate the mechanism of aggregation, the structure of the fibrils, and identify possible binding regions. We found that heparin accelerates fibrillation of all α-PSMs (except PSMα2) and δ-toxin but inhibits β-PSM fibrillation by blocking nucleation or reducing fibrillation levels. Given that S. aureus secretes higher levels of α-PSM than β-PSM peptides, heparin is therefore likely to promote fibrillation overall. Heparin binding is driven by multiple positively charged lysine residues in α-PSMs and δ-toxins, the removal of which strongly reduced binding affinity. Binding of heparin did not affect the structure of the resulting fibrils, that is, the outcome of the aggregation process. Rather, heparin provided a scaffold to catalyze or inhibit fibrillation. Based on our findings, we speculate that heparin may strengthen the bacterial biofilm and therefore enhance colonization via increased PSM fibrillation."

This study aimed to explore whether health self-management had a mediating role between social class and health under the framework of Socio-cultural Self Model.663 adults, randomly sampled from six communities in Southwest China, completed the survey for this study. Social class was assessed using individuals' income, education, occupation. Health self-management was assessed through evaluation of the health self-management behavior, health self-management cognition, health self-management environment. Physical health and mental health were measured by the Chinese version of Short-Form (36-item) Health Survey, which contains Physical Functioning, Role-Physical, Role-Emotional, Vitality, Mental Health, Social Function, Bodily Pain and General Health. Pearson's correlation was used to examine the associations between major variables. Mediation analyses were performed to explore the mediating role of health self-management.Social class positively predicted self-rated health. The lower the social class, the lower the self-reported physical and mental health. Health self-management partially mediated the relationship between social class and self-rated health. That is, the health self-management ability of the lower class, such as access to healthy and nutritious food and evaluate their own health status, is worse than that of the higher class, which leads to physical and mental health inequality between the high and the low classes.Health self-management mediated the relationship between social class and health.

However, the selective inhibition of the lyase reactions, particularly with 17α-hydroxy pregnenolone, remains a challenge for the treatment of prostate cancer. Here, we considered the mechanisms of inhibition of drugs that have been developed to inhibit P450 17A1, including ketoconazole, seviteronel, orteronel, and abiraterone, the only approved inhibitor used for prostate cancer therapy, as well as clotrimazole, known to inhibit P450 17A1. All five compounds bound to P450 17A1 in a multistep process, as observed spectrally, over a period of 10 to 30 s. However, no lags were observed for the onset of inhibition in rapid-quench experiments with any of these five compounds. Furthermore, the addition of substrate to inhibitor-P450 17A1 complexes led to an immediate formation of product, without a lag that could be attributed to conformational changes. Although abiraterone has been previously described as showing slow-onset inhibition (t1/2 = 30 min), we observed rapid and strong inhibition. These results are in contrast to inhibitors of P450 3A4, an enzyme with a larger active site in which complete inhibition is not observed with ketoconazole and clotrimazole until the changes are completed. Overall, our results indicate that both P450 17A1 reactions-17α-hydroxylation and lyase activity-are inhibited by the initial binding of any of these inhibitors, even though subsequent conformational changes occur."
https://openalex.org/W3179306335,"Personal data is ubiquitous in the digital world, can be highly valuable in aggregate, and can lead to unintended intrusions for the data creator. However, individuals' expressions of concern about exposure of their personal information are generally not matched by their behavioural caution. One reason for this mismatch could be the varied and intangible value of personal data. We present three studies investigating the potential association between personal data value and privacy behaviour, assessing both individual and cross-cultural differences in personal data valuation, comparing collectivist and individualistic cultures. Study 1a, using a representative UK sample, found no relationship between personal data value and privacy behaviour. However, Study 1b found Indian (collectivist) participants' privacy behaviour was sensitive to personal data value, unlike US (individualist) participants. Study 2 showed that in a UK sample, privacy behaviour was sensitive to personal data value but only for individuals who think of themselves as more similar to others (i.e., self-construe as similar, rather than different). We suggest those who prioritise group memberships are more sensitive to unintentional disclosure harm and therefore behave in accordance with personal data valuations-which informs the privacy concern-behaviour relationship. Our findings can suggest approaches to encourage privacy behaviours."
https://openalex.org/W3181037607,"The rate of suicide in the US has increased substantially in the past two decades, and new insights are needed to support prevention efforts. The National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS), the nation's most comprehensive registry of suicide mortality, has qualitative text narratives that describe salient circumstances of these deaths. These texts have great potential for providing novel insights about suicide risk but may be subject to information bias.To examine the relationship between decedent characteristics and the presence and length of NVDRS text narratives (separately for coroner/medical examiner (C/ME) and law enforcement (LE) reports) among 233,108 suicide and undetermined deaths from 2003-2017.Generalized estimating equations (GEE) logistic and quasi-Poisson modeling was used to examine variation in the narratives (proportion of missing texts and character length of the non-missing texts, respectively) as a function of decedent age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, marital status, military history, and homeless status. Models adjusted for site, year, location of death, and autopsy status.The frequency of missing narratives was higher for LE vs. C/ME texts (19.8% vs. 5.2%). Decedent characteristics were not consistently associated with missing text across the two types of narratives (i.e., Black decedents were more likely to be missing the LE narrative but less likely to be missing the C/ME narrative relative to non-Hispanic whites). Conditional on having a narrative, C/ME were significantly longer than LE (822.44 vs. 780.68 characters). Decedents who were older, male, had less education and some racial/ethnic minority groups had shorter narratives (both C/ME and LE) than younger, female, more educated, and non-Hispanic white decedents.Decedent characteristics are significantly related to the presence and length of narrative texts for suicide and undetermined deaths in the NVDRS. Findings can inform future research using these data to identify novel determinants of suicide mortality."
https://openalex.org/W3182221151,"To investigate pneumothorax patterns in pazopanib treatment by focusing on the positional relationship between the visceral pleura and metastatic lung tumor, we examined 20 patients with advanced soft tissue tumors who developed lung metastases and underwent pazopanib treatment between 2012 and 2019. Pneumothorax was classified into two types based on the location of the metastatic lesion around the visceral pleural area before pazopanib treatment: subpleural type, within 5 mm from the pleura; and central type, >5 mm from the pleura. We investigated the rates of pneumothorax and the associated risk factors. Five patients experienced pneumothorax (three subpleural and two central types). Cavitation preceded pneumothorax in 83% of patients and led to connection of the cavitated cyst of the metastatic lesion to the chest cavity in the shorter term in patients with the subpleural type. Conversely, a more gradual increase in the cavity size and sudden cyst rupture were observed in the central type. The risk factors for pneumothorax were cavitation after initiating pazopanib and intervention before pazopanib, either ablation or surgery. The location of the metastatic lesions was not a risk factor for the occurrence of pneumothorax. In conclusion, pneumothorax is an adverse event associated with pazopanib treatment. Therefore, attention must be paid to predisposing factors such as the formation of cavitation after pazopanib initiation and previous interventions to the lungs. Moreover, because subpleural pneumothorax tends to occur earlier than the central type, a different time course can be anticipated based on the positional relationships of the metastatic lesions to the visceral pleura."
https://openalex.org/W3182456038,"Prions are transmissible protein pathogens most reliably detected by a bioassay in a suitable host, typically mice. However, the mouse bioassay is slow and cumbersome, and relatively insensitive to low titers of prion infectivity. Prions can be detected biochemically in vitro by the protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) technique, which amplifies disease-associated prion protein but does not detect bona fide prion infectivity. Here, we demonstrate that Drosophila transgenic for bovine prion protein (PrP) expression can serve as a model system for the detection of bovine prions significantly more efficiently than either the mouse prion bioassay or PMCA. Strikingly, bovine PrP transgenic Drosophila could detect bovine prion infectivity in the region of a 10-12 dilution of classical bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) inoculum, which is 106-fold more sensitive than that achieved by the bovine PrP mouse bioassay. A similar level of sensitivity was observed in the detection of H-type and L-type atypical BSE and sheep-passaged BSE by bovine PrP transgenic Drosophila. Bioassays of bovine prions in Drosophila were performed within 7 weeks, whereas the mouse prion bioassay required at least a year to assess the same inoculum. In addition, bovine PrP transgenic Drosophila could detect classical BSE at a level 105-fold lower than that achieved by PMCA. These data show that PrP transgenic Drosophila represent a new tractable prion bioassay for the efficient and sensitive detection of mammalian prions, including those of known zoonotic potential."
https://openalex.org/W3182749514,"Background Governments across the globe responded with different strategies to the COVID-19 pandemic. While some countries adopted measures, which have been perceived controversial, others pursued a strategy aiming for herd immunity. The latter is even more controversial and has been called unethical by the WHO Director-General. Inevitably, without proper control measures, viral diversity increases and multiple infectious exposures become common, when the pandemic reaches its maximum. This harbors not only a potential threat overseen by simplified theoretical arguments in support of herd immunity, but also deserves attention when assessing response measures to increasing numbers of infection. Methods and findings We extend the simulation model underlying the pandemic preparedness web interface CovidSim 1.1 ( http://covidsim.eu/ ) to study the hypothetical effect of increased morbidity and mortality due to ‘multi-infections’, either acquired at by successive infective contacts during the course of one infection or by a single infective contact with a multi-infected individual. The simulations are adjusted to reflect roughly the situation in the USA. We assume a phase of general contact reduction (“lockdown”) at the beginning of the epidemic and additional case-isolation measures. We study the hypothetical effects of varying enhancements in morbidity and mortality, different likelihoods of multi-infected individuals to spread multi-infections and different susceptibility to multi-infections in different disease phases. It is demonstrated that multi-infections lead to a slight reduction in the number of infections, as these are more likely to get isolated due to their higher morbidity. However, the latter substantially increases the number of deaths. Furthermore, simulations indicate that a potential second lockdown can substantially decrease the epidemic peak, the number of multi-infections and deaths. Conclusions Enhanced morbidity and mortality due to multiple disease exposure is a potential threat in the COVID-19 pandemic that deserves more attention. Particularly it underlines another facet questioning disease management strategies aiming for herd immunity."
https://openalex.org/W3178372760,"Although Diabetes Self-Management Education (DSME) programs are recommended to help reduce the burden of diabetes and diabetes-related complications, Florida is one of the states with the lowest DSME participation rates. Moreover, there is evidence of geographic disparities of not only DSME participation rates but the burden of diabetes as well. Understanding these disparities is critical for guiding control programs geared at improving participation rates and diabetes outcomes. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to: (a) investigate geographic disparities of diabetes prevalence and DSME participation rates; and (b) identify predictors of the observed disparities in DSME participation rates.Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data for 2007 and 2010 were obtained from the Florida Department of Health. Age-adjusted diabetes prevalence and DSME participation rates were computed at the county level and their geographic distributions visualized using choropleth maps. Significant changes in diabetes prevalence and DSME participation rates between 2007 and 2010 were assessed and counties showing significant changes were mapped. Clusters of high diabetes prevalence before and after adjusting for common risk factors and DSME participation rates were identified, using Tango's flexible spatial scan statistics, and their geographic distribution displayed in maps. Determinants of the geographic distribution of DSME participation rates and predictors of the identified high rate clusters were identified using ordinary least squares and logistic regression models, respectively.County level age-adjusted diabetes prevalence varied from 4.7% to 17.8% while DSME participation rates varied from 26.6% to 81.2%. There were significant (p≤0.05) increases in both overall age-adjusted diabetes prevalence and DSME participation rates from 2007 to 2010 with diabetes prevalence increasing from 7.7% in 2007 to 8.6% in 2010 while DSME participation rates increased from 51.4% in 2007 to 55.1% in 2010. Generally, DSME participation rates decreased in rural areas while they increased in urban areas. High prevalence clusters of diabetes (both adjusted and unadjusted) were identified in northern and central Florida, while clusters of high DSME participation rates were identified in central Florida. Rural counties and those with high proportion of Hispanics tended to have low DSME participation rates.The findings confirm that geographic disparities in both diabetes prevalence and DSME participation rates exist. Specific attention is required to address these disparities especially in areas that have high diabetes prevalence but low DSME participation rates. Study findings are useful for guiding resource allocation geared at reducing disparities and improving diabetes outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3178933886,"One of the current challenges in long-term care homes (LTCH) is to identify the optimal model of care, which may include specialty physicians, nursing staff, person support workers, among others. There is currently no consensus on the complement or scope of care delivered by these providers, nor is there a repository of studies that evaluate the various models of care. We conducted a rapid scoping review to identify and map what care provider models and interventions in LTCH have been evaluated to improve quality of life, quality of care, and health outcomes of residents.We conducted this review over 10-weeks of English language, peer-reviewed studies published from 2010 onward. Search strategies for databases (e.g., MEDLINE) were run on July 9, 2020. Studies that evaluated models of provider care (e.g., direct patient care), or interventions delivered to facility, staff, and residents of LTCH were included. Study selection was performed independently, in duplicate. Mapping was performed by two reviewers, and data were extracted by one reviewer, with partial verification by a second reviewer.A total of 7,574 citations were screened based on the title/abstract, 836 were reviewed at full text, and 366 studies were included. Studies were classified according to two main categories: healthcare service delivery (n = 92) and implementation strategies (n = 274). The condition/ focus of the intervention was used to further classify the interventions into subcategories. The complex nature of the interventions may have led to a study being classified in more than one category/subcategory.Many healthcare service interventions have been evaluated in the literature in the last decade. Well represented interventions (e.g., dementia care, exercise/mobility, optimal/appropriate medication) may present opportunities for future systematic reviews. Areas with less research (e.g., hearing care, vision care, foot care) have the potential to have an impact on balance, falls, subsequent acute care hospitalization."
https://openalex.org/W3180990921,"Delays in seeking and accessing treatment for rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis (RR-TB) and multi-drug resistant (MDR-TB) are major impediments to TB control in high-burden, resource-limited settings.We prospectively determined health-seeking behavioural patterns and associations with treatment outcomes and costs among 68 RR-TB patients attending conveniently selected facilities in a decentralised system in Harare, Zimbabwe.From initial symptoms to initiation of effective treatment, patients made a median number of three health care visits (IQR 2-4 visits) at a median cost of 13% (IQR 6-31%) of their total annual household income (mean cost, US$410). Cumulatively, RR-TB patients most frequently first visited private facilities, i.e., private pharmacies (30%) and other private health care providers (24%) combined. Median patient delay was 26 days (IQR 14-42 days); median health system delay was 97 days (IQR 30-215 days) and median total delay from symptom onset to initiation of effective treatment was 132 days (IQR 51-287 days). The majority of patients (88%) attributed initial delay in seeking care to ""not feeling sick enough."" Total delay, total cost and number of health care visits were not associated with treatment or clinical outcomes, though our study was not adequately powered for these determinations.Despite the public availability of rapid molecular TB tests, patients experienced significant delays and high costs in accessing RR-TB treatment. Active case finding, integration of private health care providers and enhanced service delivery may reduce treatment delay and TB associated costs."
https://openalex.org/W3181047948,"Patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection are at a high general risk for in-hospital mortality. A simple and easy-to-use model for predicting mortality based on data readily available to clinicians in the first 24 hours of hospital admission might be useful in directing scarce medical and personnel resources toward those patients at greater risk of dying. With this goal in mind, we evaluated factors predictive of in-hospital mortality in a random sample of 100 patients (derivation cohort) hospitalized for COVID-19 at our institution in April and May, 2020 and created potential models to test in a second random sample of 148 patients (validation cohort) hospitalized for the same disease over the same time period in the same institution. Two models (Model A: two variables, presence of pneumonia and ischemia); (Model B: three variables, age &gt; 65 years, supplemental oxygen ≥ 4 L/min, and C-reactive protein (CRP) &gt; 10 mg/L) were selected and tested in the validation cohort. Model B appeared the better of the two, with an AUC in receiver operating characteristic curve analysis of 0.74 versus 0.65 in Model A, but the AUC differences were not significant (p = 0.24. Model B also appeared to have a more robust separation of mortality between the lowest (none of the three variables present) and highest (all three variables present) scores at 0% and 71%, respectively. These brief scoring systems may prove to be useful to clinicians in assigning mortality risk in hospitalized patients."
https://openalex.org/W3182827067,"A unique window of opportunity currently exists to generate ethical and practical considerations presented by interventional HIV cure-related research at the end-of-life (EOL). Because participants would enroll in these studies for almost completely altruistic reasons, they are owed the highest ethical standards, safeguards, and protections. This qualitative empirical ethics study sought to identify ethical and practical considerations for interventional HIV cure-related research at the EOL.We conducted 20 in-depth interviews and three virtual focus groups (N = 36) with four key stakeholder groups in the United States: 1) bioethicists, 2) people with HIV, 3) HIV care providers, and 4) HIV cure researchers. This study produced six key themes to guide the ethical implementation of interventional HIV cure-related research at the EOL: 1) all stakeholder groups supported this research conditioned upon a clearly delineated respect for participant contribution and autonomy, participant understanding and comprehension of the risks associated with the specific intervention(s) to be tested, and broad community support for testing of the proposed intervention(s); 2) to ensure acceptable benefit-risk profiles, researchers should focus on limiting the risks of unintended effects and minimizing undue pain and suffering at the EOL; 3) only well-vetted interventions that are supported by solid pre-clinical data should be tested in the EOL translational research model; 4) the informed consent process must be robust and include process consent; 5) research protocols should be flexible and adopt a patient/participant centered approach to minimize burdens and ensure their overall comfort and safety; and 6) a participant's next-of-kin/loved ones should be a major focus of EOL research but only if the participant consents to such involvement.To our knowledge, this empirical ethics study generated the first ethical and practical considerations for interventional HIV cure-related research at the EOL. The ethical complexities of such research must be considered now. We must navigate this ethical conundrum so that we are good stewards of the participants' extremely altruistic gifts by maximizing the impact and social value of this research. We hope that this study will serve as the foundation for future research and discussion on this topic."
https://openalex.org/W3178353381,"Epidermis is the most outer layer of the skin and a physical barrier protecting the internal tissues from mechanical and environmental insults. The basal keratinocytes, which, through proliferation and differentiation, supply diverse cell types for epidermal homeostasis and injury repair. Sustainable culture of murine keratinocyte, however, is a major obstacle. Here we developed murine keratinocyte lines using low-Ca2+ (0.06 mM) keratinocyte serum-free medium (KSFM-Ca2+) without feeder cells. Cells derived in this condition could be subcultured for >70 passages. They displayed basal epithelial cell morphology and expressed keratin (Krt) 14, but lacked the epithelial-characteristic intercellular junctions. Moreover, these cells could be adapted to grow in the Defined-KSFM (DKSFM) media containing 0.15 mM Ca2+, and the adapted cells established tight- and adherens-junctions and exhibited increased Krt1/10 expression while retained subculture capacity. Global gene expression studies showed cells derived in KSFM-Ca2+ media had enriched stem/proliferation markers and cells adapted in DKSFM media had epithelial progenitor signatures. Correspondingly, KSFM-Ca2+-derived cells exhibited a remarkable capacity of clonal expansion, whereas DKSFM-adapted cells could differentiate to suprabasal epithelial cell types in 3-dimentional (3D) organoids. The generation of stem-like murine keratinocyte lines and the conversion of these cells to epithelial progenitors capable of terminal differentiation provide the critically needed resources for skin research."
https://openalex.org/W3178464514,"The relative age effect (RAE) has primarily been investigated in male athletes involved in popular sports and high-level competitions. However, occurrence of RAE in other types of sports at the grassroots level, particularly in female athletes, is less well-studied. Thus, we examined the RAE in a large cohort of young athletes who participated in all competitive sports in Bizkaia, Spain, according to gender and specificity of the sport. The birth dates of 38,381 participants (65.1% males and 34.9% females) aged 9-14 years old in 37 competitive sports were analyzed. Birth dates were divided into four birth-quarters and compared to those of all children born in the same period using a χ2 goodness-of-fit test and standardized residuals. The effect size Cramer's V was measured, and odds ratio and 95% confidence intervals were calculated to determine the odds of athletes born in January playing in the highest leagues. In the total sample, in boys RAE was evident in football, but only in higher-competition leagues (p<0.001, large effect size). In girls, RAE was evident in the most popular team sports: basketball (p<0.001, large effect size in basketball 1st league), handball and football (p<0.05, both small effect sizes). Players born in January were 3.23- and 2.89-times more likely to play in the 1st leagues than those born in December, for boys (football) and girls (basketball) respectively. In the overall analysis and in the remaining sports, presence of RAE was negligible. Therefore, the date of birth does not seem to be a constraint to participating in most sports in Bizkaia. The potential mechanisms for RAE are multifactorial and complex, yet a combination of factors, such as the popularity of a sport and the depth of competition, physicality and social influences may be involved. We discuss these mechanisms and potential measures to mitigate RAE."
https://openalex.org/W3178605817,"Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are involved in the pathology of numerous inflammatory retinal degenerations, including retinitis pigmentosa (RP). Our previous work revealed that intravitreal injections with tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1 (TIMP-1) reduce the progression of rod cell death and inhibit cone cell remodeling that involves reactive gliosis in retinal Müller glial cells (MGCs) in rodent models. The underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms of how TIMP-1 functions in the retina remain to be resolved; however, MGCs are involved in structural homeostasis, neuronal cell survival and death. In the present study, MMP-9 and TIMP-1 expression patterns were investigated in a human MGC line (MIO-M1) under inflammatory cytokine (IL-1β and TNF-α) and oxidative stress (H2O2) conditions. First, both IL-1β and TNF-α, but not H2O2, have a mild in vitro pro-survival effect on MIO-M1 cells. Treatment with either cytokine results in the imbalanced secretion of MMP-9 and TIMP-1. H2O2 treatment has little effect on their secretion. The investigation of their intracellular expression led to interesting observations. MMP-9 and TIMP-1 are both expressed, not only in the cytoplasm, but also inside the nucleus. None of the treatments alters the MMP-9 intracellular distribution pattern. In contrast to MMP-9, TIMP-1 is detected as speckles. Intracellular TIMP-1 aggregation forms in the cytoplasmic area with IL-1β treatment. With H2O2 treatments, the cell morphology changes from cobbles to spindle shapes and the nuclei become larger with increases in TIMP-1 speckles in an H2O2 dose-dependent manner. Two TIMP-1 cell surface receptors, low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP-1) and cluster of differentiation 82 (CD82), are expressed within the nucleus of MIO-M1 cells. Overall, these observations suggest that intracellular TIMP-1 is a target of proinflammatory and oxidative insults in the MGCs. Given the importance of the roles for MGCs in the retina, the functional implication of nuclear TIMP-1 and MMP-9 in MGCs is discussed."

Smart transformation is critical for manufacturing enterprises in the development of smart manufacturing. This study addressed the gap between maturity models and project management by designing an effective assessment framework for smart transformation. It adopts the Smart Industry Readiness Index, created by the Singapore Economic Development Board, as a maturity assessment model to analyze enterprises' smart transformation and formulate project management strategies. Enterprises can use this model to examine the maturity level of their transformation and assess scope for improvement in their project strategies and implementation barriers. This study focuses on Taiwanese enterprises using data collected from 165 valid questionnaires and subjected to a cluster analysis. Enterprises were divided into three categories. The results reveal that, first, most enterprises' smart transformation is at an immature or medium-maturity level, and is therefore amenable to further improvement. Second, inconsistent with research findings, many enterprises invest in transformation projects but fail to advance these projects to maturity. Third, most enterprises' project management plans fail to meet actual transformation needs. Using the thematically oriented maturity model proposed in this study, Taiwanese enterprises can effectively evaluate the maturity of their transformation projects. In conclusion, the study highlights that Taiwanese enterprises must identify more effective external resources to strengthen their competitiveness."
https://openalex.org/W3179869318,"Cognitive impairments are a frequent and difficult to treat symptom in patients with schizophrenia and the strongest predictor for a successful reintegration in occupational and everyday life. Recent research suggests transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to enhance cognition in this patient group. However, the question regarding its acute effectiveness on executive functions remains largely unanswered. Here, we examined in a randomized, double blind, sham-controlled repeated-measures design the impact of tDCS on performance in several executive functions in patients with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or acute transient psychotic disorder.Patients (N = 48) were tested twice using standardized, well-constructed and clinically validated neuropsychological tests assessing verbal working memory, response inhibition, mental flexibility and problem solving. In session 1 they solely underwent the neuropsychological assessment, whereas in session 2 they additionally received 2 mA of anodal tDCS stimulation over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), cathode right supraorbital ridge, or sham stimulation for 20 minutes.Patients of both groups were not able to correctly discriminate the type of stimulation received confirming the success of the blinding procedure. However, analyzing the whole sample the change in performance from session 1 to session 2 was the same in the verum as in the sham condition (all p >.5). Moreover, a subsequent exploratory analysis showed that performance in the response inhibition task was worse for patients that engaged in the task within 20 minutes after the end of the verum stimulation.Hence, 2 mA of anodal tDCS applied over the left DLPFC did not acutely enhance executive functions in patients with schizophrenia or related disorders but impaired performance in the response inhibition task shortly after. Future studies should continue to seek for effective stimulation configurations for this patient group.The study is registered in the ""Deutsches Register Klinischer Studien DRKS"", German Clinical Trial Register and has been allocated the following number: DRKS00022126."

Patients were traced 9 months post-evaluation using contact information from TB registers. We collected information on healthcare visits and implemented locally-validated costing questionnaires to assess the financial impact of their symptoms post-evaluation.Of 70 participants, 57 (81%) were traced and 53 completed the survey. 31/53 (58%) surveyed participants returned to healthcare facilities post-evaluation, making a median of 2 visits each (interquartile range [IQR] 1-3). 11.3% (95%CI 4.3-23.0%) of surveyed patients and 16.1% (95%CI 5.5-33.7%) of those returning to healthcare facilities incurred catastrophic costs (i.e., spent >20% annual household income). Indirect costs related to lost work represented 80% (IQR 32-100%) of total participant costs.Patients with TB symptoms who experience financial catastrophe after negative TB evaluation may represent a larger absolute number of patients than those suffering from costs due to TB. They may not be captured by existing definitions of non-TB catastrophic health expenditure."
https://openalex.org/W3182433015,"Vacuolar H+-ATPases (V-ATPases) are large, multisubunit proton pumps that acidify the lumen of organelles in virtually every eukaryotic cell and in specialized acid-secreting animal cells, the enzyme pumps protons into the extracellular space. In higher organisms, most of the subunits are expressed as multiple isoforms, with some enriched in specific compartments or tissues and others expressed ubiquitously. In mammals, subunit a is expressed as four isoforms (a1-4) that target the enzyme to distinct biological membranes. Mutations in a isoforms are known to give rise to tissue-specific disease, and some a isoforms are upregulated and mislocalized to the plasma membrane in invasive cancers. However, isoform complexity and low abundance greatly complicate purification of active human V-ATPase, a prerequisite for developing isoform-specific therapeutics. Here, we report the purification of an active human V-ATPase in native lipid nanodiscs from a cell line stably expressing affinity-tagged a isoform 4 (a4). We find that exogenous expression of this single subunit in HEK293F cells permits assembly of a functional V-ATPase by incorporation of endogenous subunits. The ATPase activity of the preparation is >95% sensitive to concanamycin A, indicating that the lipid nanodisc-reconstituted enzyme is functionally coupled. Moreover, this strategy permits purification of the enzyme's isolated membrane subcomplex together with biosynthetic assembly factors coiled-coil domain-containing protein 115, transmembrane protein 199, and vacuolar H+-ATPase assembly integral membrane protein 21. Our work thus lays the groundwork for biochemical characterization of active human V-ATPase in an a subunit isoform-specific manner and establishes a platform for the study of the assembly and regulation of the human holoenzyme."

Gonadotropins are the key regulator of the reproduction in mammals. In this study, PTPN5 is detected to express in murine pituitary in a developmental manner. Moreover, the expression of PTPN5 in the pituitary is heavily reduced after ovary removal. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) secretion in gonadotropes is regulated by PTPN5 via binding GnRH to GnRH-R. Two parallel signaling pathways, Gs-protein kinase A (PKA)-PTPN5 and Gq-phospholipases C (PLC)-p38 MAPK-PTPN5, cooperatively regulate GnRH-induced FSH secretion. We also show that influx of Ca2+ activates the Ca2+-dependent phosphatase calcineurin, leading to the phosphorylation and activation of PTPN5. The intracellular release of Ca2+ is reduced via TC2153. In conclusion, blocking or knocking out of PTPN5 reduces the release of FSH in whole pituitary. Mechanically, PTPN5 regulates gonadotropes' function through regulating intracellular calcium homeostasis."

Many sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) countries, including Nigeria are adopting the use of LLIN and IPTp to fight malaria. Albeit, the coverage of these interventions to prevent malaria across geographical divisions have been understudied in many countries. In this study, we aimed to explore the differentials in LLIN and IPTp uptake across Nigerian geopolitical zones.We analyzed data from Nigeria Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) 2016-17. The outcome variables were IPTp and LLIN uptake among women of childbearing age (15-49 years). A total sample of 24,344 women who had given birth were examined for IPTp use and 36,176 women for LLIN use. Percentages, Chi-square test and multivariable logit models plots were used to examine the geopolitical zones differentials in IPTp and LLIN utilization. Data was analyzed at 5% level of significance.The overall prevalence of IPTp was 76.0% in Nigeria. Moreover, there were differences across geopolitical zones: North Central (71.3%), North East (76.9%), North West (78.2%), South East (76.1%), South South (79.7%) and South West (72.4%) respectively. Furthermore, the prevalence of LLIN was 87.7%% in Nigeria.

Women who have access to media use, married, educated and non-poor were more likely to uptake IPTp. On the other hand, rural dwellers and those with media use were more likely to use LLIN. Conversely, married, educated, non-poor and women aged 25-34 and 35+ were less likely to use LLIN.Though the utilization of IPTp and LLIN was relatively high, full coverage are yet to be achieved. There was geopolitical zones differentials in the prevalence of IPTp and LLIN in Nigeria. Promoting the utilization of IPTp and LLINs across the six geopolitical zones through intensive health education and widespread mass media campaigns will help to achieve the full scale IPTp and LLIN utilization."
https://openalex.org/W3178727973,"There is ample research supporting White's (1967) thesis, which postulates that religion and religious belief inhibit ecological concerns. This study thus seeks to explore the relationship between individuals' acceptability for harming animals as one representation of ecological concern (measured using Animal Issue scale (AIS)) and their religious belief (measured using Religious Orientation Scale (ROS)) and ethical ideology (measured using Ethical Position Questionnaire (EPQ)). The study surveyed 929 Muslim teachers and school staff in East Java, Indonesia. We found that ROS correlates with EPQ whereby intrinsic personal (IP) relates with idealism while extrinsic social religious orientation (ES)-where religion is perceived as an instrument for social gain, membership and support-relates with relativism. However, using multiple regression analysis to examine both EPQ and ROS relation to acceptability for harming animals suggests mixed results. We found that, idealism and IP relate to a lower acceptability for harming animals, while relativism and ES correlate to a higher acceptability for harming animals. In another model where we calculate all the main variables with all the demographical and other determinants, we found that only ROS consistently relates to acceptability for harming animals. Additionally, we identify, explain and discuss significant demographic determinants along with this study's limitations."
https://openalex.org/W3180379354,"Dengue has emerged as a major public health problem in Bhutan, with increasing incidence and widening geographic spread over recent years. This study aimed to investigate the knowledge and clinical management of dengue among medical practitioners in Bhutan.We administered a survey questionnaire to all practitioners currently registered under the Bhutan Medical and Health Council. The questionnaire contained items on four domains including transmission, clinical course and presentation, diagnosis and management, and surveillance and prevention of dengue. Participants were able to respond using an online Qualtrics survey, with the invitation and link distributed via email.A total of 97 respondents were included in the study (response rate: 12.7%), of which 61.86% were Health Assistants/Clinical Officers (HAs/COs) and 38.14% were medical doctors. The afternoon feeding behaviour of Aedes mosquito was correctly identified by only 24.7% of the respondents, and ~66.0% of them failed to identify lethargy as a warning sign for severe dengue. Knowledge on diagnosis using NS1 antigen and the clinical significance of elevated haematocrit for initial fluid replacement was strikingly low at 47.4% and 27.8% respectively. Despite dengue being a nationally notifiable disease, ~60% of respondents were not knowledgeable on the timing and type of cases to be reported. Respondent's median score was higher for the surveillance and reporting domain, followed by their knowledge on transmission of dengue. Statistically significant factors associated with higher knowledge included respondents being a medical doctor, working in a hospital and experience of having diagnosed dengue.The study revealed major gaps on knowledge and clinical management practices related to dengue in Bhutan. Physicians and health workers working in Basic Health Units need training and regular supervision to improve their knowledge on the care of dengue patients."
https://openalex.org/W3183618191,"HIV-1 matrix protein p17 variants (vp17s) derived from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) tissues of HIV-1-seropositive (HIV+) patients promote B-cell growth by activating the Akt signaling pathway. It is fundamental to understand the role played by vp17s in producing a microenvironment that fosters lymphoma development and progression. Therefore, we asked whether vp17s could be secreted from infected cells in their biologically active form. In this study, we show that two B-cell growth-promoting vp17s, NHL-a101 and NHL-a102, characterized by amino acid insertions at position 117 to 118 (Ala-Ala) or 125 to 126 (Gly-Asn), respectively, are secreted from HIV-1-infected Jurkat T cells during the active phase of viral replication. Secretion of biologically active vp17s also occurred in HeLa cells nucleofected with a plasmid expressing the entire Gag gene, following proteolytic cleavage of the Gag precursor polyprotein (Pr55Gag) by cellular aspartyl proteases. Binding of Pr55Gag to phosphatidylinositol-(4,5)-bisphosphate was indispensable for allowing the unconventional secretion of both wildtype p17 and vp17s. Indeed, here we demonstrate that inhibition of Pr55Gag binding to phosphatidylinositol-(4,5)-bisphosphate by using neomycin, or its enzymatic depletion achieved by overexpression of 5ptaseIV, significantly impair the secretion of p17s. We also demonstrated that heparan sulfate proteoglycans were involved in tethering p17s at the cell surface. This finding opens up an interesting way for investigating whether tethered p17s on the surface of HIV-1 reservoirs may represent a likely target for immune-mediated killing."
https://openalex.org/W3186020868,"Protein structural bioinformatic analyses suggest preferential associations between methionine and aromatic amino acid residues in proteins. Ab initio energy calculations highlight a conformation-dependent stabilizing interaction between the interacting sulfur-aromatic molecular pair. However, the relevance of buried methionine-aromatic motifs to protein folding and function is relatively unexplored. The Small Ubiquitin-Like Modifier (SUMO) is a β-grasp fold protein and a common posttranslational modifier that affects diverse cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, chromatin remodeling, metabolic regulation, mitosis, and meiosis. SUMO is a member of the Ubiquitin-Like (UBL) protein family. Herein, we report that a highly conserved and buried methionine-phenylalanine motif is a unique signature of SUMO proteins but absent in other homologous UBL proteins. We also detect that a specific ""up"" conformation between the methionine-phenylalanine pair of interacting residues in SUMO is critical to its β-grasp fold. The noncovalent interactions of SUMO with its ligands are dependent on the methionine-phenylalanine pair. MD simulations, NMR, and biophysical and biochemical studies suggest that perturbation of the methionine-aromatic motif disrupts native contacts, modulates noncovalent interactions, and attenuates SUMOylation activity. Our results highlight the importance of conserved orientations of Met-aromatic structural motifs inside a protein core for its structure and function."
https://openalex.org/W3178133854,"Artificial pancreas system (APS) is an emerging new treatment for type 1 diabetes mellitus. The aim of this study was to develop a rat APS as a research tool and demonstrate its application. We established a rat APS using Medtronic Minimed Pump 722, Medtronic Enlite sensor, and the open artificial pancreas system as a controller. We tested different dilutions of Humalog (100 units/ml) in saline ranged from 1:3 to 1:20 and determined that 1:7 dilution works well for rats with ~500g bodyweight. Blood glucose levels (BGL) of diabetic rats fed with chow diet (58% carbohydrate) whose BGL was managed by the closed-loop APS for the total duration of 207h were in euglycemic range (70-180 mg/dl) for 94.5% of the time with 2.1% and 3.4% for hyperglycemia (>180mg/dl) and hypoglycemia (<70 mg/dl), respectively. Diabetic rats fed with Sucrose pellets (94.8% carbohydrate) for the experimental duration of 175h were in euglycemic range for 61% of the time with 35% and 4% for hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, respectively. Heathy rats fed with chow diet showed almost a straight line of BGL ~ 95 mg/dl (average 94.8 mg/dl) during the entire experimental period (281h), which was minimally altered by food intake. In the healthy rats, feeding sucrose pellets caused greater range of BGL in high and low levels but still within euglycemic range (99.9%). Next, to study how healthy and diabetic rats handle supra-physiological concentrations of glucose, we intraperitoneally injected various amounts of 50% dextrose (2, 3, 4g/kg) and monitored BGL. Duration of hyperglycemia after injection of 50% dextrose at all three different concentrations was significantly greater for healthy rats than diabetic rats, suggesting that insulin infusion by APS was superior in reducing BGL as compared to natural insulin released from pancreatic β-cells. Ex vivo studies showed that islets isolated from diabetic rats were almost completely devoid of pancreatic β-cells but with intact α-cells as expected. Lipid droplet deposition in the liver of diabetic rats was significantly lower with higher levels of triacylglyceride in the blood as compared to those of healthy rats, suggesting lipid metabolism was altered in diabetic rats. However, glycogen storage in the liver determined by Periodic acid-Schiff staining was not altered in diabetic rats as compared to healthy rats. A rat APS may be used as a powerful tool not only to study alterations of glucose and insulin homeostasis in real-time caused by diet, exercise, hormones, or antidiabetic agents, but also to test mathematical and engineering models of blood glucose prediction or new algorithms for closed-loop APS."
https://openalex.org/W3179198489,"The primary aim of this study was to determine the relationship between a team numerical advantage during structured phases of play and match event outcomes in professional Australian football. The secondary aim was to quantify how players occupy different sub-areas of the playing field in match play, while accounting for match phase and ball location. Spatiotemporal player tracking data and play-by-play event data from professional players and teams were collected from the 2019 Australian Football League season played at a single stadium. Logistic regression analysed the relationship between total players and team numerical advantage during clearances and inside 50's. Total players and team numerical advantage were also quantified continuously throughout a match, which were separated into three match phases (offence, defence, and stoppage) and four field positions (defensive 50, defensive midfield, attacking midfield, and forward 50). Results identified an increased team numerical advantage produced a greater likelihood of gaining possession from clearances or generating a score from inside 50's. Although, an increased number of total players inside 50 was likely associated with a concomitant decrease in the probability of scoring, irrespective of a team numerical advantage. Teams were largely outnumbered when the ball was in their forward 50 but attained a numerical advantage when the ball was in the defensive 50."
https://openalex.org/W3179326612,"Anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (a-tDCS) has been shown to improve bicycle time to fatigue (TTF) tasks at 70-80% of VO2max and downregulate rate of perceived exertion (RPE). This study aimed to investigate the effect of a-tDCS on a RPE-clamp test, a 250-kJ time trial (TT) and motor evoked potentials (MEP). Twenty participants volunteered for three trials; control, sham stimulation and a-tDCS. Transcranial magnetic stimulation was used to determine the corticospinal excitability for 12 participants pre and post sham stimulation and a-tDCS. The a-tDCS protocol consisted of 13 minutes of stimulation (2 mA) with the anode placed above the Cz. The RPE-clamp test consisted of 5 minutes ergometer bicycling at an RPE of 13 on the Borg scale, and the TT consisted of a 250 kJ (∼10 km) long bicycle ergometer test. During each test, power output, heart rate and oxygen consumption was measured, while RPE was evaluated. MEPs increased significantly by 36% (±36%) post a-tDCS, with 8.8% (±31%) post sham stimulation (p = 0.037). No significant changes were found for any parameter at the RPE-clamp or TT. The lack of improvement may be due to RPE being more controlled by afferent feedback during TT tests than during TTF tests. Based on the results of the present study, it is concluded that a-tDCS applied over Cz, does not enhance self-paced cycling performance."
https://openalex.org/W3181580280,"Despite recent interest in the mental health benefits of increasing physical activity (PA) and reducing sedentary behaviour (SB), little is known about PA and SB counselling provided by mental health professionals. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore the attitudes and practices of mental health professionals in recommending more PA and less SB to their clients.Quantitative data were collected using a modified version of the Exercise in Mental Illness Questionnaire in a sample of 17 Australian mental health professionals. The collected data were reported using percentages (for categorical data) and means and standard deviations (for numerical data). Additionally, in focus group discussions, 10 mental health professionals provided in-depth information about their clinical practice, facilitators, and perceived barriers in recommending more PA and less SB. They also provided suggestions on how to potentially improve their PA and SB counselling practices. The focus groups were audio-recorded, transcribed and analysed using thematic analysis.Only 35.3% of participants have undergone formal training in recommending PA in the treatment of mental illness. Most participants (64.7%) ranked PA counselling among the top three types of mental health treatment. All participants reported recommending PA to their clients at least ""occasionally"", while 88% of them also provided SB counselling. However, the recommendations provided were usually not specific. The most commonly reported barriers for providing PA and SB counselling were a lack of knowledge and confidence. Participants also believed that, if they were more active themselves, they would be in a better position to recommend PA to their clients, by sharing their own experience of evidence-informed strategies designed to increase PA and reduce SB.The findings of this study indicate that mental health professionals commonly provide generic PA and SB counselling to their clients. PA and SB counselling in the mental health setting could be improved by: including training on PA and SB counselling in formal education and continued professional training for mental health professionals; implementing interventions to increase PA and reduce SB among mental health professionals themselves; and ensuring support from an exercise or PA promotion specialist as a part of a multi-disciplinary approach to mental health care."
https://openalex.org/W3182351438,"Primary care consultation is significantly influenced by communication between the General Practitioner (GP) and their patients. Hypothesising that patient satisfaction can be tested based on an expectation-experience comparison, the aim of this article is to discuss the influence of communication on patient satisfaction.A standardised questionnaire was developed striving for a universal primary care survey tool that focuses on patient satisfaction in the context of patient-centred-communication. The sample consisted of 14 German GPs with 80 patients each (n = 1120). Due to the inclusion in an overarching cluster-randomised-study (CRT), the medical practices to be examined were divided into intervention and control groups. The intervention was developed as a reflective training on patient-centred communication.The results in the present sample show no correlation between patient-centred-communication and patient satisfaction. There are also no significant differences between the intervention and control group.The results raise the question to what extent patient satisfaction can be shaped significantly through patient-centred-communication. The presented project represents part of the basic research in general medical care research and contributes to the transparent processing of theoretical assumptions. With the results described here, communication models with a focus on patient centredness can be evaluated with regard to their practical relevance and transferability."
https://openalex.org/W3178419961,"Dupuytren's disease (DD) is a fibroproliferative disorder of the palmar aponeurosis, which is characterized by a compound myofibrogenesis and evidenced by an increased expression of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA). In Dupuytren's tissue, higher levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are documented, stimulating the proliferation and differentiation of myofibroblasts. Our preliminary study demonstrates that α-SMA-expression is significantly inhibited by blue light irradiation in DD. The objective of this study was to investigate the beneficial effect of blue light irradiation and to elucidate the influence of ROS on myofibrogenesis in the pathogenesis of DD. Therefore, an in-vitro model of human DD fibroblasts was used. DD fibroblasts and control fibroblasts isolated from carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) were daily irradiated with 40 J/cm2 (λ = 453 nm, 38 mW/cm2). Protein expression of ROS-modulating enzymes (Catalase, NOX4, SOD1, MnSOD) and α-SMA were determined, and additionally analysed after a pharmacological inhibition of the TGF-β1-signaling with SB431542. Furthermore, the protein expression of α-SMA as surrogate parameter for myofibrogenesis was evaluated after applying different concentrations of long-lasting ROS. It could be determined that the beneficial blue light irradiation, which inhibited myofibrogenesis, is mediated by a significant inhibition of catalase protein expression. This effect should be accompanied with an increased intracellular ROS level. Proof of evidence was an H2O2-application on DD fibroblasts, also leading to a decreased myofibrogenesis. Furthermore, it could be demonstrated that endogenous MnSOD was significantly downregulated in resting DD fibroblasts. If DD fibroblasts were treated with the pharmacological inhibitor SB431542, myofibrogenesis was inhibited, but MnSOD expression was simultaneously elevated, which ought to affect ROS level by raising intracellular H2O2 amount. Blue light irradiation as well as the pharmacological action of SB431542 in consequence mediates their beneficial effect on disturbed myofibrogenesis in DD by further increasing ROS level. The present study demonstrates the importance of intracellular ROS homeostasis in DD and illuminates the beneficial effect of blue light as a promising therapy option for DD."
https://openalex.org/W3179301581,"Knowledge of non-breeding distributions is a crucial component to seabird conservation, as conditions during the non-breeding period can play an important role in regulating seabird populations. Specifically, if seabirds from different colonies share the same wintering grounds, conditions in that shared region could have a widespread impact on multiple breeding populations. Red-legged kittiwakes (Rissa brevirostris) are endemic to the Bering Sea and may be especially susceptible to effects of climate change due to a restricted breeding range, small population size, and specialized diet. To examine whether red-legged kittiwakes from different breeding colonies overlapped in winter distribution and activity patterns, we used geolocation loggers to simultaneously track individuals from the two largest red-legged kittiwake breeding colonies in Alaska (separated by over 1000 km) during two consecutive non-breeding periods. We found that non-breeding activity patterns were generally similar between birds originating from the two colonies, but birds employed different migratory strategies during the early winter. Kittiwakes from Buldir Island in the western Aleutian Islands left the colony in September and immediately headed west, spending October through December around the Sea of Okhotsk and the Kuril Islands. In contrast, birds from St. George Island in the Pribilof Islands remained in the eastern Bering Sea or around the eastern Aleutian Islands for a couple months before traveling farther west. During late winter however, from January through March, birds from both colonies converged south of Kamchatka and east of the Kuril Islands over the Kuril-Kamchatka Trench and in the Western Subarctic Gyre before returning to their respective colonies in the spring. This late winter overlap in distributions along the Kuril-Kamchatka Trench suggests the region is a winter hotspot for red-legged kittiwakes and highlights the importance of this region for the global kittiwake population."
