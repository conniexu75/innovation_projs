https://openalex.org/W2135237314,"We report on the Bose-Einstein condensation of more than 10 5 Li 2 molecules in an optical trap starting from a spin mixture of fermionic lithium atoms. During forced evaporative cooling, the molecules are formed by three-body recombination near a Feshbach resonance and finally condense in a long-lived thermal equilibrium state. We measured the characteristic frequency of a collective excitation mode and demonstrated the magnetic field–dependent mean field by controlled condensate spilling."
https://openalex.org/W2040628293,"Secretion of cytolytic granules content at the immunological synapse is a highly regulated process essential for lymphocyte cytotoxicity. This process requires the rapid transfer of perforin containing lytic granules to the target cell interface, followed by their docking and fusion with the plasma membrane. Defective cytotoxicity characterizes a genetically heterogeneous condition named familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (FHL), which can be associated with perforin deficiency. The locus of a perforin (+) FHL subtype (FHL3), observed in 10 patients, was mapped to 17q25. This region contains hMunc13-4, a member of the Munc13 family of proteins involved in vesicle priming function. HMunc13-4 mutations were shown to cause FHL3. HMunc13-4 deficiency results in defective cytolytic granule exocytosis, despite polarization of the secretory granules and docking with the plasma membrane. Expressed tagged hMunc13-4 localizes with cytotoxic granules at the immunological synapse. HMunc13-4 is therefore essential for the priming step of cytolytic granules secretion preceding vesicle membrane fusion."
https://openalex.org/W2066660409,"In C. elegans, the transcription factor DAF-16 promotes longevity in response to reduced insulin/IGF-1 signaling or germline ablation. In this study, we have asked how different tissues interact to specify the lifespan of the animal. We find that several tissues act as signaling centers. In particular, DAF-16 activity in the intestine, which is also the animal's adipose tissue, completely restores the longevity of daf-16(-) germline-deficient animals, and increases the lifespans of daf-16(-) insulin/IGF-1-pathway mutants substantially. Our findings indicate that DAF-16 may control two types of downstream signals: DAF-16 activity in signaling cells upregulates DAF-16 in specific responding tissues, possibly via regulation of insulin-like peptides, and also evokes DAF-16-independent responses. We suggest that this network of tissue interactions and feedback regulation allows the tissues to equilibrate and fine-tune their expression of downstream genes, which, in turn, coordinates their rates of aging within the animal."
https://openalex.org/W2055188333,"In budding yeast, many proteins involved in endocytic internalization, including adaptors and actin cytoskeletal proteins, are localized to cortical patches of differing protein composition. Using multicolor real-time fluorescence microscopy and particle tracking algorithms, we define an early endocytic pathway wherein an invariant sequence of changes in cortical patch protein composition correlates with changes in patch motility. Three Arp2/3 activators each showed a distinct behavior, suggesting distinct patch-related endocytic functions. Actin polymerization occurs late in the endocytic pathway and is required both for endocytic internalization and for patch disassembly. In cells lacking the highly conserved endocytic protein Sla2p, patch motility was arrested and actin comet tails associated with endocytic patch complexes. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching of the actin comet tails revealed that endocytic complexes are nucleation sites for rapid actin polymerization. Attention is now focused on the mechanisms by which the order and timing of events in this endocytic pathway are achieved."
https://openalex.org/W2001680897,"Very few gene conversions in mitotic cells are associated with crossovers, suggesting that these events are regulated. This may be important for the maintenance of genetic stability. We have analyzed the relationship between homologous recombination and crossing-over in haploid budding yeast and identified factors involved in the regulation of crossover outcomes. Gene conversions unaccompanied by a crossover appear 30 min before conversions accompanied by exchange, indicating that there are two different repair mechanisms in mitotic cells. Crossovers are rare (5%), but deleting the BLM/WRN homolog, SGS1, or the SRS2 helicase increases crossovers 2- to 3-fold. Overexpressing SRS2 nearly eliminates crossovers, whereas overexpression of RAD51 in srs2Δ cells almost completely eliminates the noncrossover recombination pathway. We suggest Sgs1 and its associated topoisomerase Top3 remove double Holliday junction intermediates from a crossover-producing repair pathway, thereby reducing crossovers. Srs2 promotes the noncrossover synthesis-dependent strand-annealing (SDSA) pathway, apparently by regulating Rad51 binding during strand exchange."

Evidence of distributary, channelized flow (in particular, flow that lasted long enough to foster meandering) and the resulting deposition of a fan-shaped apron of debris indicate persistent flow conditions and formation of at least some large intracrater layered sedimentary sequences within fluvial, and potentially lacustrine, environments."
https://openalex.org/W2021384012,"Understanding the functional organization of the human primary auditory cortex (PAC) is an essential step in elucidating the neural mechanisms underlying the perception of sound, including speech and music. Based on invasive research in animals, it is believed that neurons in human PAC that respond selectively with respect to the spectral content of a sound form one or more maps in which neighboring patches on the cortical surface respond to similar frequencies (tonotopic maps). The number and the cortical layout of such tonotopic maps in the human brain, however, remain unknown. Here we use silent, event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging at 7 Tesla and a cortex-based analysis of functional data to delineate with high spatial resolution the detailed topography of two tonotopic maps in two adjacent subdivisions of PAC. These maps share a low-frequency border, are mirror symmetric, and clearly resemble those of presumably homologous fields in the macaque monkey."

https://openalex.org/W2014408809,"The NMDA subtype of glutamate receptors (NMDAR) at excitatory neuronal synapses plays a key role in synaptic plasticity. The extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1,2 or ERK) pathway is an essential component of NMDAR signal transduction controlling the neuroplasticity underlying memory processes, neuronal development, and refinement of synaptic connections. Here we show that NR2B, but not NR2A or NR1 subunits of the NMDAR, interacts in vivo and in vitro with RasGRF1, a Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent Ras-guanine-nucleotide-releasing factor. Specific disruption of this interaction in living neurons abrogates NMDAR-dependent ERK activation. Thus, RasGRF1 serves as NMDAR-dependent regulator of the ERK kinase pathway. The specific association of RasGRF1 with the NR2B subunit and study of ERK activation in neurons with varied content of NR2B suggests that NR2B-containing channels are the dominant activators of the NMDA-dependent ERK pathway."

https://openalex.org/W2045651327,"The human T cell leukemia virus (HTLV) is associated with leukemia and neurological syndromes. The physiopathological effects of HTLV envelopes are unclear and the identity of the receptor, present on all vertebrate cell lines, has been elusive. We show that the receptor binding domains of both HTLV-1 and -2 envelope glycoproteins inhibit glucose transport by interacting with GLUT-1, the ubiquitous vertebrate glucose transporter. Receptor binding and HTLV envelope-driven infection are selectively inhibited when glucose transport or GLUT-1 expression are blocked by cytochalasin B or siRNAs, respectively. Furthermore, ectopic expression of GLUT-1, but not the related transporter GLUT-3, restores HTLV infection abrogated by either GLUT-1 siRNAs or interfering HTLV envelope glycoproteins. Therefore, GLUT-1 is a receptor for HTLV. Perturbations in glucose metabolism resulting from interactions of HTLV envelope glycoproteins with GLUT-1 are likely to contribute to HTLV-associated disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2154686098,"Cognitive theories of numerical representation suggest that understanding of numerical quantities is driven by a magnitude representation associated with the intraparietal sulcus and possibly under genetic control. The aim of this study was to investigate, using fMRI and structural imaging, the interaction between the abnormal development of numerical representation in an X-linked condition, Turner syndrome (TS), and the development of the intraparietal sulcus. fMRI during exact and approximate calculation in TS showed an abnormal modulation of intraparietal activations as a function of number size. Morphological analysis revealed an abnormal length, depth, and sulcal geometry of the right intraparietal sulcus, suggesting an important disorganization of this region in TS. Thus, a genetic form of developmental dyscalculia can be related to both functional and structural anomalies of the right intraparietal sulcus, suggesting a crucial role of this region in the development of arithmetic abilities."
https://openalex.org/W2025111140,"RNA polymerase (RNAP) transcribes DNA discontinuously, with periods of rapid nucleotide addition punctuated by frequent pauses. We investigated the mechanism of transcription by measuring the effect of both hindering and assisting forces on the translocation of single Escherichia coli transcription elongation complexes, using an optical trapping apparatus that allows for the detection of pauses as short as one second. We found that the vast majority of pauses are brief (1–6 s at 21°C, 1 mM NTPs), and that the probability of pausing at any particular position on a DNA template is low and fairly constant. Neither the probability nor the duration of these ubiquitous pauses was affected by hindering or assisting loads, establishing that they do not result from the backtracking of RNAP along the DNA template. We propose instead that they are caused by a structural rearrangement within the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2021885143,"Recent research has revived interest in the possibility that previously consolidated memories need to reconsolidate when recalled to return to accessible long-term memory. Evidence suggests that both consolidation and reconsolidation of certain types of memory require protein synthesis, but whether similar molecular mechanisms are involved remains unclear. Here, we explore whether zif268, an activity-dependent inducible immediate early gene (IEG) required for consolidation of new memories, is also recruited for reconsolidation of recognition memory following reactivation. We show that when a consolidated memory for objects is recalled, zif268 mutant mice are impaired in further long-term but not short-term recognition memory. The impairment is specific to reactivation with the previously memorized objects in the relevant context, occurs in delayed recall, and does not recover over several days. These findings indicate that IEG-mediated transcriptional regulation in neurons is one common molecular mechanism for the storage of newly formed and reactivated recognition memories."
https://openalex.org/W2167157682,"Cadherins and catenins are thought to promote adhesion between pre and postsynaptic elements in the brain. Here we show a role for beta-catenin in localizing the reserved pool of vesicles at presynaptic sites. Deletion of beta-catenin in hippocampal pyramidal neurons in vivo resulted in a reduction in the number of reserved pool vesicles per synapse and an impaired response to prolonged repetitive stimulation. This corresponded to a dispersion of vesicles along the axon in cultured neurons. Interestingly, these effects are not due to beta-catenin's involvement in cadherin-mediated adhesion or wnt signaling. Instead, beta-catenin modulates vesicle localization via its PDZ binding domain to recruit PDZ proteins such as Veli to cadherin at synapses. This study defines a specific role for cadherins and catenins in synapse organization beyond their roles in mediating cell adhesion."
https://openalex.org/W1975483893,"AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) play a major role in excitatory synaptic transmission and plasticity. Channel properties are largely dictated by their composition of the four subunits, GluR1-4 (or A-D). Here we show that AMPAR assembly and subunit stoichiometry are determined by RNA editing in the pore loop. We demonstrate that editing at the GluR2 Q/R site regulates AMPAR assembly at the step of tetramerization. Specifically, edited R subunits are largely unassembled and ER retained, whereas unedited Q subunits readily tetramerize and traffic to synapses. This assembly mechanism restricts the number of the functionally critical R subunits in AMPAR tetramers. Therefore, a single amino acid residue affects channel composition and, in turn, controls ion conduction through the majority of AMPARs in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2134765462,"The glycine transporter subtype 1 (GlyT1) is widely expressed in astroglial cells throughout the mammalian central nervous system and has been implicated in the regulation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activity. Newborn mice deficient in GlyT1 are anatomically normal but show severe motor and respiratory deficits and die during the first postnatal day. In brainstem slices from GlyT1-deficient mice, in vitro respiratory activity is strikingly reduced but normalized by the glycine receptor (GlyR) antagonist strychnine. Conversely, glycine or the GlyT1 inhibitor sarcosine suppress respiratory activity in slices from wild-type mice. Thus, during early postnatal life, GlyT1 is essential for regulating glycine concentrations at inhibitory GlyRs, and GlyT1 deletion generates symptoms found in human glycine encephalopathy."
https://openalex.org/W2072465203,"The glycine transporter subtype 2 (GlyT2) is localized in the axon terminals of glycinergic neurons. Mice deficient in GlyT2 are normal at birth but during the second postnatal week develop a lethal neuromotor deficiency that resembles severe forms of human hyperekplexia (hereditary startle disease) and is characterized by spasticity, tremor, and an inability to right. Histological and immunological analyses failed to reveal anatomical or biochemical abnormalities, but the amplitudes of glycinergic miniature inhibitory currents (mIPSCs) were strikingly reduced in hypoglossal motoneurons and dissociated spinal neurons from GlyT2-deficient mice. Thus, postnatal GlyT2 function is crucial for efficient transmitter loading of synaptic vesicles in glycinergic nerve terminals, and the GlyT2 gene constitutes a candidate disease gene in human hyperekplexia patients."
https://openalex.org/W2003421056,"S100P is a member of the S100 protein family that is expressed in several malignant neoplasms. Currently the effects of this molecule on cell function are unknown. In the present study we investigated the biological effects and mechanisms of action of S100P using NIH3T3 cells. Expression of S100P in NIH3T3 cells led to the presence of S100P in the culture medium, increased cellular proliferation, and enhanced survival after detachment from the culture substrate or after exposure to the chemotherapeutic agent 5-flurouracil. The proliferation and survival effects of S100P expression were duplicated in a time- and concentration-dependent manner by the extracellular addition of purified S100P to wild-type NIH3T3 cells and correlated with the activation of extracellular-regulated kinases (Erks) and NF-κB. To determine the mechanisms involved in these effects, we tested the hypothesis that S100P activated RAGE (receptor for activated glycation end products). We found that S100P co-immunoprecipitated with RAGE. Furthermore, the effects of S100P on cell signaling, proliferation, and survival were blocked by agents that interfere with RAGE including administration of an amphoterin-derived peptide known to antagonize RAGE activation, anti-RAGE antibodies, and by expression of a dominant negative RAGE. These data suggest that S100P can act in an autocrine manner via RAGE to stimulate cell proliferation and survival.

These data suggest that S100P can act in an autocrine manner via RAGE to stimulate cell proliferation and survival. The S100 family consists of Ca2+-binding proteins of the EF-hand type with at least 20 members (1Donato R. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 33: 637-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1308) Google Scholar, 2Heizmann C.W. Fritz G. Schafer B.W. Front. Biosci. 2002; 7: 1356-1368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although these molecules are widely expressed, none appear to be ubiquitous, and several have highly restricted distributions (1Donato R. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 33: 637-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1308) Google Scholar). The functions of these proteins vary widely between individual members. S100 proteins can function as both intracellular and extracellular signaling molecules. Intracellular actions of S100 proteins are isoform-specific and include Ca2+-dependent regulation of a variety of intracellular activities including protein phosphorylation, enzyme activities, cytoskeletal function, intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis, and protection from oxidative cell damage (1Donato R. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 33: 637-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1308) Google Scholar, 3McNutt N.S. J. Cutan. Pathol. 1998; 25: 521-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 4Schafer B.W.

Bull. 1995; 37: 417-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). Several S100s are also known to be released from cells and to act extracellularly. Although the mechanisms for the extracellular effects of many S100 proteins are not known and there may be differences between isoforms, both S100A12 and S100B proteins have previously been shown to act extracellularly through their abilities to activate the receptor for activated glycation end products (RAGE), 1The abbreviations used are: RAGEreceptor for activated glycation end productsErkextracellular-regulated kinaseELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay5-FU5-fluorouracilpoly-HEMApolyhydroxyethyl methacrylateDndominant negativeMTS[3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfphenyl)-2-H-tetrazolium, inner salt).1The abbreviations used are: RAGEreceptor for activated glycation end productsErkextracellular-regulated kinaseELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay5-FU5-fluorouracilpoly-HEMApolyhydroxyethyl methacrylateDndominant negativeMTS[3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfphenyl)-2-H-tetrazolium, inner salt). leading to the suggestion that this may be an important mechanism for extracellular effects of S100 proteins (6Hofmann M.A. Drury S. Fu C. Qu W. Taguchi A. Lu Y. Avila C. Kambham N. Bierhaus A. Nawroth P. Neurath M.F. Slattery T. Beach D. McClary J. Nagashima M. Morser J. Stern D. Schmidt A.M. Cell. 1999; 97: 889-901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1582) Google Scholar).One of the least studied members of the S100 family is S100P, a 95-amino acid protein first purified from placenta with a restricted cellular distribution (7Becker T. Gerke V. Kube E. Weber K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 541-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 8Emoto Y. Kobayashi R. Akatsuka H. Hidaka H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 182: 1246-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The molecular structure of S100P has been well described and supports its classification in the S100 family of proteins (9Zhang H. Wang G. Ding Y. Wang Z. Barraclough R. Rudland P.S. Fernig D.G. Rao Z. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 785-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Expression of S100P has been noted in esophageal epithelial cells during their differentiation, indicating that it may play a role in normal development (10Sato N. Hitomi J. Anat. Rec. 2002; 267: 60-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). There is also considerable evidence that S100P plays a role in cancer. S100P expression has been noted in various cancer cell lines including breast cancer, where it was associated with cellular immortalization (11Guerreiro I, D.S. Hu Y.F. Russo I.H. Ao X. Salicioni A.M. Yang X. Russo J. Int. J. Oncol. 2000; 16: 231-240PubMed Google Scholar), and colon cancer, where its expression was elevated in doxorubicin-resistant cells (12Bertram J. Palfner K. Hiddemann W. Kneba M. Anticancer Drugs. 1998; 9: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). S100P has also been shown to be expressed in tumors, including prostate cancer, where its expression is androgen-sensitive (13Averboukh L. Liang P. Kantoff P.W. Pardee A.B. Prostate. 1996; 29: 350-355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and pancreatic adenocarcinoma, where expression has been localized to the neoplastic epithelium of pancreatic (14Logsdon C.D. Simeone D.M. Binkley C. Arumugam T. Greenson J.K. Giordano T.J. Misek D.E. Hanash S. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2649-2657PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, S100P expression has been shown to be correlated with decreased survival in patients with lung cancer (15Beer D.G. Kardia S.L. Huang C.C. Giordano T.J. Levin A.M. Misek D.E. Lin L. Chen G. Gharib T.G. Thomas D.G. Lizyness M.L. Kuick R. Hayasaka S. Taylor J.M. Iannettoni M.D. Orringer M.B. Hanash S. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 816-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (1645) Google Scholar). Despite the evidence indicating the potential importance of this molecule in normal and transformed cell function, its effects on cell function are unknown. Previous studies have utilized affinity columns to identify molecules that may interact with S100P. It was observed that S100P can interact with the cytoskeletal protein ezrin in a Ca2+-dependent manner and influence its ability to bind actin (16Koltzscher M. Neumann C. Konig S. Gerke V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2372-2384Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). S100P has also been reported to be able to interact with CacyBP/SIP, a component of a novel ubiquitinylation pathway, leading to β catenin degradation (17Filipek A. Jastrzebska B. Nowotny M. Kuznicki J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28848-28852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether S100P interacts with these molecules under in vivo conditions or what effects these interactions might have on cell function.RAGE is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell surface molecules that is activated by multiple ligands (6Hofmann M.A. Drury S. Fu C. Qu W. Taguchi A. Lu Y. Avila C. Kambham N. Bierhaus A. Nawroth P. Neurath M.F. Slattery T. Beach D. McClary J. Nagashima M. Morser J. Stern D. Schmidt A.M.

Biosci. 2001; 6: 1151-1160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RAGE was originally identified based on its ability to bind advanced glycation end products, which are adducts formed by glycoxidation (20Cerami A. Vlassara H. Brownlee M. Diabetes Care. 1988; 11: 73-79PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, it has been observed that RAGE can be activated by a number of specific ligands including amphoterin, amyloid-β peptide, and members of the S100 family and play important roles in a variety of disease states including inflammation, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, and cancer (21Schmidt A.M. Yan S.D. Yan S.F. Stern D.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 949-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). In the context of cancer cells, activation of RAGE has been found to stimulate cell proliferation, survival, and motility (22Taguchi A. Blood D.C. del Toro G. Canet A. Lee D.C. Qu W. Tanji N. Lu Y. Lalla E. Fu C. Hofmann M.A. Kislinger T. Ingram M. Lu A. Tanaka H. Hori O. Ogawa S. Stern D.M. Schmidt A.M. Nature. 2000; 405: 354-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1094) Google Scholar). The intracellular signaling mechanisms activated by RAGE are not completely understood, but occupation of RAGE by its ligands leads to stimulation of extracellular-regulated kinase (Erk), Rho, and Jak/Stat signaling as well as activation of the transcription factor NF-κB (23Stern D.M. Yan S.D. Yan S.F. Schmidt A.M. Ageing Res. Rev. 2002; 1: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The role of RAGE activation in S100P signaling has not been previously examined.In the current study, we observed that expression of S100P led to the release of this molecule into the culture media and conferred proliferation and survival benefits to NIH3T3 cells. We then tested the hypothesis that extracellular S100P could influence cell function through the activation of RAGE. NIH3T3 cells were treated with purified S100P, which led to dose- and time-dependent increases in cell proliferation and survival. The effects of S100P on cell function correlated with its ability to activate Erks and the transcription factor NF-κB. Evidence that these biological effects were mediated by S100P activation of RAGE included the observation that these two molecules could be co-immunoprecipitated. Furthermore, blocking the interaction between S100P and RAGE using anti-RAGE antibodies, administration of a peptide antagonist derived from amphoterin, or expression of a dominant negative truncated RAGE inhibited the biological and signaling effects of S100P. Taken together, these data suggest that S100P can act in an autocrine manner to stimulate cell growth and survival through activation of RAGE.MATERIALS AND METHODSDevelopment of Stable Cell Lines—NIH3T3 cells obtained from the American Type Culture collection (Manassas, VA) were transfected using LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) with plasmids encoding human S100P or a dominant negative RAGE (22Taguchi A. Blood D.C. del Toro G. Canet A. Lee D.C. Qu W. Tanji N. Lu Y. Lalla E. Fu C. Hofmann M.A. Kislinger T. Ingram M. Lu A. Tanaka H. Hori O. Ogawa S. Stern D.M. Schmidt A.M. Nature. 2000; 405: 354-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1094) Google Scholar) cloned into pcDNA3.1 vector and selected for resistance to G418 (0.5 mg/ml). Wild-type and stably transfected NIH3T3 cells were routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Data are shown for a single representative stable cell line, but all experiments were reproduced with at least two other monoclonally selected cell lines (data not shown).Expression and Purification of S100P—Full-length human S100P cDNA was cloned into the pTrcHis2 vector and transformed into one-shot TOP10 competent Escherichia coli (Invitrogen). The bacterial culture was incubated at 37 °C to an A600 = 0.6, then isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm) was added, and the bacteria were cultured for another 3 h. His-S100P was purified using a Probond resin column as described by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). The fraction was further dialyzed against 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, containing 0.1% Triton X 100 overnight at 4 °C using a Slide-A-Lyzer 10K (Pierce). The dialyzed protein was further concentrated by a Centricon centrifugal filter device YM10 (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The purity of the S100P protein was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting, and ELISA was used for in vitro experiments. To monitor for nonspecific effects, proteins from non-induced bacteria were utilized as a control.SDS-PAGE, Western Blot Analysis, and Co-immunoprecipitation— Western blot analysis was utilized for the detection of S100P, RAGE, and Erks by minor modifications of previously published methods (24Ji B. Chen X.Q. Misek D.E. Kuick R. Hanash S. Ernst S. Najarian R. Logsdon C.D. Physiol. Genomics. 2003; 14: 59-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were prepared and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose. Membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C in 5% milk solution. S100P was detected by incubating the transferred membrane overnight at 4 °C with anti-human monoclonal antibody (Transduction Laboratories, San Diego, CA) at 1:1000 dilution in 5% milk solution. RAGE was detected by incubating the transferred membrane for 1 h at room temperature with anti-human goat polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA) at 1:100 dilution in 5% milk solution. Erk activation was estimated by detection of phosphorylated forms of Erk 1 and 2 using phospho-p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (Thr-202/Tyr-204) antibody (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA) and as a loading control a rabbit polyclonal antibody for total Erk 1 and 2 (Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA) by incubating the membrane at 4 °C for overnight with antibody diluted 1:100 in 5% milk solution. Secondary antibody anti-mouse, anti-rabbit, or anti-goat IgG plus horseradish peroxidase antibody was incubated for 1 h at room temperature, and the signal was detected by the ECL detection system (Amersham) as per the manufacturer's protocol.For co-immunoprecipitation experiments cell lysates were incubated in the absence or presence of purified S100P (1 μg) at 4 °C overnight. S100P was immunoprecipitated using a monoclonal antibody against S100P for 6 h at 4 °C and IgG-immobilized beads (Pierce). Antibody-associated proteins were electrophoresed on 10% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The transferred membrane was blocked by 5% milk solution overnight at 4 °C. RAGE was detected by Western blotting as described.Cell Growth Studies—Cell growth was analyzed using the MTS reagent (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's directions. For studies on the effects of exogenously applied S100P, purified S100P was added at the indicated concentrations for the specified times. Control cells were treated with non-induced bacterial protein. For studies on cell survival cells were treated with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) at the concentrations indicated for the specified times, or cells were plated on dishes previously coated with polyhydroxyethyl methacrylate (poly-HEMA; Sigma-Aldrich). Poly-HEMA dissolved at 10 mg/ml in ethanol and 3 ml of solution was added to each well, and plates were kept at 37 °C for 5 days to evaporate solvent completely. Cell numbers were estimated using MTS, which was added to the wells 1 h before taking the photometric reading.ELISA for S100P—S100P was quantified in the media collected from S100P-transfected NIH3T3 cells. S100P was captured between a anti-bovine S100B rabbit polyclonal antibody (Abcam Ltd., Cambridge, UK) and the S100P monoclonal antibody using an ELISA kit (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD). Cells were plated at 1 × 105 cells per well for 3 days, and medium was collected and concentrated using YM10 Centricon concentrating filters. Concentrated samples (200 μl) were incubated for 2 h at room temperature in antibody-coated plates and washed three times with wash buffer. Bound S100P was detected with horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse secondary antibody and TMB (3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidene) substrate. Color development was blocked with 1 m phosphoric acid and read at 450 nm. Purified S100P was used as a standard, and placental lysate was used as a positive control.NF-κB Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear extracts were prepared and used for electrophoretic mobility shift assays as previously described (25Han B. Logsdon C.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: 74-82Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For NF-κB DNA binding the reaction was started by the addition of 10,000 cpm of the 22-base pair oligonucleotide 5′-AGT TGA GGG GAC TTT CCC AGG C-3′ containing the NF-κB consensus sequence that had been labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (10 mCi/mmol) by T4 polynucleotide kinase. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 min at room temperature. For cold competition experiments unlabeled NF-κB oligonucleotide or OCT1 oligonucleotide as a nonspecific competitor (300×) was added to the binding reaction 5 min before the addition of the radiolabeled probe. For antibody supershift assays 2 μl of specific antibodies to NF-κB protein subunits p65, p50, and c-Rel were incubated with nuclear extracts for 1 h at room temperature before the addition of labeled probe. All reaction mixtures were subjected to PAGE on 4.5% gel in 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA buffer at 200 V. Gels were dried and directly exposed to a B-1 phosphorimaging screen and visualized with a GS-250 Molecular Imaging System (Bio-Rad).Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorter Analysis—Standard propidium iodide staining by the hypotonic lysis method was used for cell cycle and apoptosis studies. Wild-type and S100P-transfected NIH-3T3 cells were seeded in 100-mm plates for 48 h. Apoptosis was induced by treating with 150 μg/ml 5-FU. After 48 h cells were collected by trypsinization, washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline, mixed with 500 μl of hypotonic solution (0.1% sodium citrate, 0.1% Triton X-100, 100 μg/ml RNase, 50μg/ml propidium iodide), and analyzed by flow cytometry after 30 min incubation. Cells undergoing apoptosis that had lost part of their DNA (due to the DNA fragmentation) were detected as the population of cells with sub-G1 DNA contents.RESULTSExpression of S100P Stimulates NIH3T3 Cell Growth and Survival—To evaluate the influence of S100P on cell function, NIH3T3 cells stably expressing this molecule were produced using standard transfection techniques. S100P was detected in cell lysates after but not before transfection (Fig. 1A). S100P expression did not stimulate these cells to form colonies in soft agar, suggesting a lack of transforming ability (data not shown). However, S100P expression increased the proliferation rate of NIH3T3 cells to 251 ± 42% that of control (n = 3, p < 0.05) within 72 h (Fig. 1B). This increase in proliferation rate correlated with an increased proportion of the cell population in S phase (Fig. 1C). Similar results were observed in two other independently derived stable NIH cell lines (data not shown).S100P expression also influenced NIH3T3 cell survival after two apoptotic insults, detachment from the growth substrate (causing anoikis) or treatment with the cytotoxic agent 5-FU. When wild-type NIH3T3 cells were plated on dishes coated with poly-HEMA, which prevents cell attachment, the cells underwent rapid induction of anoikis, indicated by a reduction in cell numbers (Fig. 2A). In contrast, S100P-expressing NIH3T3 cells were remarkably resistant to this treatment. Furthermore, the chemotherapeutic agent 5-FU (150 μg/ml) was able to efficiently kill wild-type NIH3T3 cells, but S100P-expressing cells were resistant to this treatment (Fig. 2B). The survival benefits of S100P expression were due to an inhibition of apoptosis, as indicated by a reduced proportion of cells with sub-G1 levels of DNA content after 72 h of treatment with 5-FU (Fig. 2C) and by a reduction in the appearance of active caspase 3 after plating on poly-HEMA for 3 h (data not shown).Fig. 2Expression of S100P protects NIH3T3 cells against cell death induced by detachment or 5-FU.A, effects of detachment on wild-type and S100P-expressing NIH3T3 cells. Cells were plated on poly-HEMA-coated dishes to prevent cell attachment and incubated for indicated times, and cell viability was analyzed using the MTS method. Data shown are the means ± S.E. for three experiments (*, p < 0.05). B, effects of 5-FU treatment on wild-type (WT) and S100P-expressing NIH-3T3 cell numbers.

Data shown are the means ± S.E. for three experiments (*, p < 0.05). C, effects of 5-FU treatment on apoptosis in wild-type and S100P-expressing NIH-3T3 cells. Cells were cultured in the presence of 5-FU (150 μg/ml) for 48 h, and the number of apoptotic cells was estimated as the percentage of cells with sub-G1 DNA contents as quantitated using fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. Data shown are the means ± S.E. for three experiments (*, p < 0.05).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We hypothesized that the effects of S100P expression might be due to secretion of S100P and activation of autocrine signaling mechanisms. Therefore, we examined the level of S100P in conditioned media from NIH3T3 cells using an ELISA assay. S100P was detected in media bathing cells stably transfected with S100P (22 ± 4 ng/ml, n = 5) but not media from wild-type NIH3T3 cells (undetectable). Therefore, to avoid the complications of potential intracellular actions of S100P, we subsequently focused on the effects of extracellularly added S100P.Extracellular S100P Stimulates NIH3T3 Cell Growth and Survival—To test the effects of extracellular S100P on cell function we produced purified S100P as a histidine-tagged fusion protein in bacteria. Purity of the protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3A), and specificity was confirmed by Western blot (Fig. 3B). Non-induced bacterial proteins were used as a control. The addition of purified S100P (0.01–1000 nm) to NIH3T3 cells stimulated cell proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner. Effects were noted with 0.01 nm, and maximal effects (188 ± 23% of control, p < 0.05, n = 3) were observed with 100 nm S100P (Fig. 3C). The effects of S100P on cell proliferation were also time-dependent, with a significant increase in cell proliferation noted within 48 h after the addition of 100 nm S100P to the culture medium (Fig. 3D).Fig. 3Exogenous S100P stimulates NIH3T3 cell proliferation and survival.A, S100P was synthesized in E. coli, and His-S100P protein was purified using a nickel column. Expression and purity of protein was confirmed by SDS-PAGE. M. Wt. kD, molecular mass in kDa. B, specificity of S100P was confirmed by Western blot by using a monoclonal S100P antibody. BXPc3 cell lysate was used as a positive control (+), and non-induced bacterial protein was used as a negative control (Bacterial Protein). C, S100P stimulated proliferation was concentration-dependent. Wild-type NIH3T3 cells were incubated with the indicated concentrations of S100P for 48 h. D, S100P stimulated proliferation was time-dependent. Cells were incubated with 100 nm S100P for the indicated times. E, S100P increased cell survival after treatment with 5-FU in a concentration-dependent manner. Wild-type NIH3T3 cells were incubated in the presence of 5-FU (150 μg/ml) and the indicated concentrations of S100P for 48 h. F, S100P increased cell survival after cell detachment was time-dependent. Wild-type NIH3T3 cells were plated onto poly-HEMA-coated dishes for the indicated times in the presence and absence of S100P (100 nm). Protein from non-induced bacteria was used as a control. Cell numbers were estimated using MTS, and data shown are the means ± S.E. (n = 3; *, p < 0.05).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The addition of S100P to the culture medium also increased the survival of NIH3T3 cells. Pretreatment of wild-type NIH3T3 cells with S100P (100 nm) reduced the loss of cells due to treatment with 5-FU (150 μg/ml) in a concentration-dependent manner with significant protection (p < 0.05, n = 3) observed at 10 nm (Fig. 3E) and nearly complete protection at 100 nm S100P. The effects of S100P on cell survival were also time-dependent, with protection from the effects of 5-FU treatment noted within 36 h and persisting for at least 48 h (Fig. 3F).S100P Activates Erks and NF-κB—We examined the effects of extracellular S100P on cell growth and survival signaling pathways. Erk activation is commonly associated with stimulation of cell proliferation. Treatment of NIH3T3 cells with purified S100P induced Erk 1 and 2 phosphorylation in a time-dependent manner, with significant effects noted within 10 min, and a maximal increase over control levels (458 ± 30% of control, n = 3) was observed after 30 min (Fig. 4A). Beyond 30 min Erk phosphorylation levels returned toward base line but remained significantly elevated for at least 2 h. The effects of S100P on Erk phosphorylation were also concentration-dependent, with significant effects noted at 0.01 nm and maximal effects noted with 100 nm S100P (Fig. 4B).Fig. 4Exogenous S100P stimulates Erk activation in NIH3T3 cells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Purified S100P was added to medium bathing wild-type NIH3T3 cells, and activation of Erks 1 and 2 was visualized by Western blotting with anti-phospho-Erk (P-Erk), then the membranes were stripped and reprobed with antibodies for total Erks (T-Erk). A, induction of Erks by S100P was time-dependent. Wild-type NIH3T3 cells were treated with S100P (100 nm) for the indicated times (0–120 min). B, induction of Erks by S100P was concentration-dependent. Wild-type NIH3T3 cells were treated with purified S100P at the indicated concentrations or with non-induced bacterial protein (BP) for 30 min. Data are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)NF-κB activation is often associated with increased cell survival. Therefore, we investigated whether extracellular S100P activated this transcription factor. S100P caused a time-dependent increase in NF-κB DNA binding in NIH3T3 cells that was significant within 10 min and was maintained for at least 1 h (Fig. 5A). The specificity of the NF-κB band observed in these assays was indicated by competition with unlabeled κB site oligonucleotides. Furthermore, super-shift analysis using antibodies specific for individual NF-κB subunits indicated the presence of p50, p65, and to a lesser extent c-Rel in the induced complexes (Fig. 5A). These effects on NF-κB activation were also concentration-dependent, with significant effects noted at 0.1 nm, and a maximal effect was observed with 100 nm S100P (494 ± 38% of control, n = 3) (Fig. 5B).Fig. 5Exogenous S100P stimulates NF-κB activation in NIH3T3 cells. Purified S100P was added to the medium bathing wild-type NIH3T3 cells, and NF-κB activation was assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. A, S100P effects on NF-κB were time-dependent. Nuclear extracts from wild-type NIH3T3 cells treated with S100P at 100 nm for the indicated times (0–60 min) were subjected to electrophoretic mobility shift assays with equal amounts of nuclear protein per sample. To assess specificity, competition with 300× excess of unlabeled κB oligonucleotide (cold oligo) was added to the reaction before the addition of labeled κB oligonucleotide. For supershift analysis nuclear extracts were incubated for 1"
https://openalex.org/W2167511682,"Endophilin is a membrane-associated protein required for endocytosis of synaptic vesicles. Two models have been proposed for endophilin: that it alters lipid composition in order to shape membranes during endocytosis, or that it binds the polyphosphoinositide phosphatase synaptojanin and recruits this phosphatase to membranes. In this study, we demonstrate that the unc-57 gene encodes the Caenorhabditis elegans ortholog of endophilin A. We demonstrate that endophilin is required in C. elegans for synaptic vesicle recycling. Furthermore, the defects observed in endophilin mutants closely resemble those observed in synaptojanin mutants. The electrophysiological phenotype of endophilin and synaptojanin double mutants are virtually identical to the single mutants, demonstrating that endophilin and synaptojanin function in the same pathway. Finally, endophilin is required to stabilize expression of synaptojanin at the synapse. These data suggest that endophilin is an adaptor protein required to localize and stabilize synaptojanin at membranes during synaptic vesicle recycling."
https://openalex.org/W1988214498,"Activation of the cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) pathway has been proposed as a mechanism for improving age-related cognitive deficits based on studies of hippocampal function. However, normal aging also afflicts prefrontal cortical cognitive functioning. Here, we report that agents that increase PKA activity impair rather than improve prefrontal cortical function in aged rats and monkeys with prefrontal cortical deficits. Conversely, PKA inhibition ameliorates prefrontal cortical cognitive deficits. Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses of rat brain further indicate that the cAMP/PKA pathway becomes disinhibited in the prefrontal cortex with advancing age. These data demonstrate that PKA inhibition, rather than activation, is the appropriate strategy for restoring prefrontal cortical cognitive abilities in the elderly."
https://openalex.org/W2014944893,"NOXO1 (Nox organizing protein 1) and NOXA1 (Nox activating protein 1) are homologs of p47phox and p67phox. p47phox functions in phagocytes as an essential organizing protein mediating the binding of other regulatory proteins during activation of the phagocyte oxidase, and its translocation to the membrane is triggered upon cell activation by hyperphosphorylation, which relieves autoinhibition of SH3 and PX domains. NOXO1 lacks an autoinhibitory region and phosphorylation sites that are present in p47phox. Co-transfection of Nox1, NOXO1, and NOXA1 reconstitutes ROS (reactive oxygen species) generation in HEK293 cells in the absence of cell stimulation. NOXO1 binds to the phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) lipids PtdIns 3,5-P2, PtdIns 5-P, and PtdIns 4-P. Unlike p47phox, which is located in the cytosol of resting cells and translocates to the plasma membrane where gp91phox is located, NOXO1 co-localizes with Nox1 in the membranes of resting cells. This localization of NOXO1 is dictated by its PX domain, since this domain but not the remainder of the molecule localizes to membranes. A point mutation in the PX domain of holo-NOXO1 decreases lipid binding resulting in cytosolic localization and also inhibits NOXO1-activation of Nox1. Thus, in transfected HEK293 cells, NOXO1 and NOXA1 activate Nox1 without the need for agonist activation, and this is mediated in part by binding of the NOXO1 PX domain to membrane lipids."
https://openalex.org/W2135998787,"Dendritic spines receive excitatory synapses and serve as calcium compartments, which appear to be necessary for input-specific synaptic plasticity. Dendrites of GABAergic interneurons have few or no spines and thus do not possess a clear morphological basis for synapse-specific compartmentalization. We demonstrate using two-photon calcium imaging that activation of single synapses on aspiny dendrites of neocortical fast spiking (FS) interneurons creates highly localized calcium microdomains, often restricted to less than 1 microm of dendritic space. We confirm using ultrastructural reconstruction of imaged dendrites the absence of any morphological basis for this compartmentalization and show that it is dependent on the fast kinetics of calcium-permeable (CP) AMPA receptors and fast local extrusion via the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. Because aspiny dendrites throughout the CNS express CP-AMPA receptors, we propose that CP-AMPA receptors mediate a spine-free mechanism of input-specific calcium compartmentalization."
https://openalex.org/W2122283324,"We demonstrate that distinct forms of the yeast chromatin-remodeling enzyme Isw1p sequentially regulate each stage of the transcription cycle. The Isw1a complex (Iswlp/Ioc3p) represses gene expression at initiation through specific positioning of a promoter proximal dinucleosome, whereas the Isw1b complex (Iswlp/Ioc2p/Ioc4p) acts within coding regions to control the amount of RNA polymerase (RNAPII) released into productive elongation and to coordinate elongation with termination and pre-mRNA processing. These effects of Isw1b are controlled via phosphorylation of the heptad repeat carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of RNAPII and methylation of the chromatin template. The transcription elongation factor Spt4p antagonizes Isw1p and overcomes the Isw1p dependent pausing of RNAPII at the onset of the elongation cycle. Overall these studies establish the central role played by Isw1p in the coordination of transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1995910380,"Apoptotic elimination of T cells at sites of inflammation or infiltration into tumors limits an effective immune response. T cell apoptosis can be initiated by a variety of triggers, including galectin-1, a soluble, secreted lectin that binds to oligosaccharide ligands on cell surface glycoproteins, or to oligosaccharide ligands on extracellular matrix glycoproteins in tissue stroma. Although galectin-1 has no transmembrane domain and is secreted from cells that make it, it is not clear if galectin-1 functions as a soluble death trigger <i>in vivo</i>. We examined the ability of stromal cells secreting galectin-1 to kill T cells. Although the stromal cells synthesized abundant galectin-1, the majority of the galectin-1 remained bound to the cell surface, and stromal cell-associated galectin-1 killed bound T cells. In contrast, insufficient amounts of functional galectin-1 were released from the stromal cells into the media to kill T cells in the absence of contact with stromal cells. However, when stromal cells were grown on Matrigel, a mixture of extracellular matrix proteins, or on permeable membranes above Matrigel, secreted galectin-1 bound to Matrigel and killed T cells without stromal cell contact. Ten-fold less galectin-1 on Matrigel was sufficient to kill adherent T cells compared with soluble galectin-1. These results demonstrate that galectin-1 in extracellular matrix is able to directly kill susceptible T cells. Because increased galectin-1 deposition in tumor stroma occurs with tumor progression in various types of cancer, galectin-1 in stroma may act locally in the apoptotic elimination of infiltrating T cells during an immune response."
https://openalex.org/W2018928754,"Many neurodegenerative diseases, including tauopathies, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and the polyglutamine diseases, are characterized by intracellular aggregation of pathogenic proteins. It is difficult to study modifiers of this process in intact cells in a high-throughput and quantitative manner, although this could facilitate molecular insights into disease pathogenesis. Here we introduce a high-throughput assay to measure intracellular polyglutamine protein aggregation using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). We screened over 2800 biologically active small molecules for inhibitory activity and have characterized one lead compound in detail. Y-27632, an inhibitor of the Rho-associated kinase p160ROCK, diminished polyglutamine protein aggregation (EC50 ≅ 5 μM) and reduced neurodegeneration in a Drosophila model of polyglutamine disease. This establishes a novel high-throughput approach to study protein misfolding and aggregation associated with neurodegenerative diseases and implicates a signaling pathway of previously unrecognized importance in polyglutamine protein processing."
https://openalex.org/W2082559028,"Located within the perisinusoidal space and surrounded by extracellular matrix, hepatic stellate cells (HSC) undergo phenotypic trans-differentiation called “myofibroblastic activation” in liver fibrogenesis. This study investigated the regulation of interleukin-1 (IL-1α) on expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) by HSC grown in three-dimensional extracellular matrix and the role of MMPs in HSC activation. To recapitulate the in vivo “quiescent” state of HSC, the isolated rat HSC were grown in three-dimensional Matrigel or type I collagen. Stimulation with IL-1α caused robust induction of pro-MMP-9 (the precursor of matrix metalloproteinase-9) when HSC were cultured in these matrices. IL-1α induced a conversion of the pro-MMP-9 to the active form only when the cells were in type I collagen. In collagen lattices, IL-1α provoked activation of HSC with induction of MMP-13, MMP-3, and breakdown of the matrix. The HSC activation was completely prevented by a treatment of the cells with tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 or deprivation of MMP-9. Once fully activated, HSC failed to express MMP-9 and showed attenuated induction of MMP-13 and MMP-3. Further, we demonstrated colocalization of α-smooth muscle actin and MMP-9 in a subpopulation of HSC in human fibrotic liver tissues. Thus, this study provides a novel model to enlighten the role of MMPs, particularly that of MMP-9, in HSC activation regulated by a specific cytokine in liver fibrogenesis.

Liver Dis. 1999; 19: 129-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The ultimate outcome of liver fibrosis is the formation of nodules encapsulated by fibrillar scar matrix (2Tsukamoto H.

In the process of fibrosis, HSC undergo dramatic morphological and functional changes called “activation” during which the star-shaped HSC are converted to myofibroblast-like cells with induced expression of α-smooth muscle actin and stress fibers but decreased retinoid storage. Liver fibrogenesis is initiated by hepatocyte damage and subsequent recruitment and activation of Kupffer cells, platelets, and inflammatory cells via the release of fibrogenic cytokines and growth factors (2Tsukamoto H. Alcohol Clin. Exp. Res. 1999; 23: 911-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). These soluble factors and the surrounding extracellular matrix are the two major classes of mediators that determine the fate of HSC. The morphological and metabolic changes associated with HSC activation are reproduced by culturing isolated HSC on plastic (9de Leeuw A.M. McCarthy S.P. Geerts A. Knook D.L.

Sci. 1998; 857: 110-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). On the other hand, excessive remodeling of ECM occurs in chronic diseases such as tumor metastasis, unhealed trauma, and arthritis (25Liotta L.A. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Steeg P.S. Cancer Invest. 1991; 9: 543-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). For liver fibrosis, the intracellular events that occur in activation of HSC have been characterized (26Eng F.J. Friedman S.L. Semin. Liver Dis. 2001; 21: 385-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and changes in the matrix substratum were shown to affect the behavior of HSC (27Benyon R.C. Arthur M.J.

Goddard S. Murphy G. Benyon R.C. Arthur M.J. Clin. Sci. (Lond.). 1995; 89: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). However, the precise role of the ECM remodeling in HSC activation is yet to be explored. In particular, there are few investigations on ECM remodeling and HSC activation in a three-dimensional ECM culture model, which more closely mimics HSC in vivo (30Senoo H. Hata R. Kaibogaku Zasshi. 1994; 69: 719-733PubMed Google Scholar, 31Imai K. Senoo H. Anat. Rec. 1998; 250: 430-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Within the perisinusoidal space, HSC are in direct contact with the loose matrix composed of basement membrane constituents on the endothelial side and with type I and III collagen fibers on the parenchymal side (32Wake K. Motomatsu K. Senoo H. Cell Tissue Res. 1987; 249: 289-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These ECMs support the three-dimensional cell structure and morphology of HSC in the quiescent state in vivo. Matrix remodeling is mostly carried out by the balance between activities of proteinases and their inhibitors (33Parks W.C. Wound Repair Regen. 1999; 7: 423-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of zinc metalloendopeptidases and responsible for the turnover of all of the ECM components (34Werb Z. Cell. 1997; 91: 439-442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar). In a rat model of bile duct ligation-induced hepatic fibrosis, MMP-2 and MMP-9 are elevated during liver fibrosis (35Kossakowska A.E. Edwards D.R. Lee S.S. Urbanski L.S. Stabbler A.L. Zhang C.L. Phillips B.W. Zhang Y. Urbanski S.J. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 153: 1895-1902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Earlier investigations have shown that primary cultures of rat HSC produce pro-MMP-2 and that the proteolytic activation of the zymogen is facilitated by type I collagen (36Arthur M.J. Friedman S.L. Roll F.J. Bissell D.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 1076-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 37Theret N. Lehti K. Musso O. Clement B. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 462-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In a mouse model of acute hepatitis caused by TNF-α, the lethality, hypothermia, and influx of leukocytes into the liver are all prevented by a broad spectrum MMP inhibitor, suggesting a role for MMPs even in acute hepatitis (38Wielockx B. Lannoy K. Shapiro S.D. Itoh T. Itohara S. Vandekerckhove J. Libert C. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1202-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). MMP-9, also called gelatinase B and type IV collagenase, was originally identified as a secreted factor of alveolar macrophages (39Mainardi C.L. Hasty K.A. Hibbs M.S. Coll. Relat. Res. 1984; 4: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Based on the substrate preference, MMP-9 is believed to participate in remodeling of basement membrane and cell migration (40Murphy G. Ward R. Hembry R.M. Reynolds J.J. Kuhn K. Tryggvason K. Biochem. J. 1989; 258: 463-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). MMP-9 is secreted as a zymogen and maintained in the latent form presumably by the interaction of a conserved cysteine in N-terminal prodomain with the zinc atom in the catalytic sites. Activation by cleavage of the prodomain is essential for the enzymatic activity and is observed in many chronic diseases (41Matrisian L.M. Bioessays. 1992; 14: 455-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar). For example, the active form of MMP-9 is present in hepatocellular carcinoma, suggesting a prognostic value (42Maatta M. Soini Y. Liakka A. Autio-Harmainen H. Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 2726-2734PubMed Google Scholar), and overexpression of MMP-9 correlates with the growth of small hepatocellular carcinoma (43Sakamoto Y. Mafune K. Mori M. Shiraishi T. Imamura H. Takayama T. Makuuchi M. Int. J. Oncol. 2000; 17: 237-243PubMed Google Scholar). However, the regulatory mechanisms underlying pro-MMP-9 activation still remain elusive. In this study we examined the IL-1-mediated regulation of MMPs and its role in HSC activation in the three-dimensional ECM environment. This culture model simulates the morphologic characteristics of the quiescent HSC in vivo (31Imai K. Senoo H. Anat. Rec. 1998; 250: 430-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Under this condition, no MMP-9 is generated. When HSC are embedded in three-dimensional Matrigel, IL-1α induces pro-MMP-9 expression without its activation. In contrast, IL-1α causes massive induction and proteolytic activation of pro-MMP-9 by HSC grown in three-dimensional type I collagen gel, whereas IL-1α or three-dimensional type I collagen individually fails to do so. On the other hand, HSC grown in three-dimensional fibrin lattices do not generate MMP-9 in response to the cytokine stimulation. IL-1α also induces MMP-13, an interstitial collagenase, and MMP-3 (stromelysin-1), a wide spectrum proteinase, by HSC grown in the collagen matrix. Parallel to the IL-1α-induced expression and activation of the multiple MMPs in three-dimensional collagen, HSC undergo activation and cause the breakdown of the collagen matrix. To support a link between MMP-9 activities with HSC activation, we show that inhibition of MMP-9 by TIMP-1 or depletion of the proteinase by gelatin-Sepharose 4B attenuates the IL-1α-induced HSC activation. Further, we demonstrate colocalization of MMP-9 and α-smooth muscle actin in human liver fibrosis specimens. Taken together we propose that MMP activities including that of MMP-9 are essential for IL-1-induced trans-differentiation of HSC during the early phase of liver fibrogenesis. Isolation Rat HSC—HSC were isolated from male Wistar rats (Charles River) by the Non-Parenchymal Liver Cell Core of the Research Center for Alcoholic Liver and Pancreatic Diseases. The normal Wistar rats were treated by in situ sequential digestion with Pronase and collagenase followed by arabinogalactan gradient ultracentrifugation as described previously (10Friedman S.L. Rockey D.C. McGuire R.F. Maher J.J. Boyles J.K. Yamasaki G. Hepatology. 1992; 15: 234-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 44Tsukamoto H. Cheng S. Blaner W.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: G581-G586PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the liver was sequentially digested with Pronase (Roche Applied Science) and type IV collagenase (Sigma) by in situ perfusion. Parenchymal cells were removed by centrifugation of the digest at 50 × g for 2 min, and nonparenchymal cells were laid on top of the four density gradients of arabinogalactan (Sigma). The gradients were centrifuged at 21,400 rpm for 40 min at 25 °C using a Beckman SW41 Ti rotor (Beckman Instruments). A pure fraction of HSC was recovered from the interface between the medium and the density of 1.035. The purity of HSC was assessed by phase-contrast microscopy and ultraviolet excited fluorescence microscope, and the viability was examined by the trypan blue exclusion test. Both the purity and viability of the cells always exceeded 95%. Cell Culture and Embedding in Three-dimensional Matrix—The model used in the most of the experiments described below is based on a comparison of morphologic and biochemical parameters of HSC cultured in three-dimensional matrices (type I collagen gel, Matrigel, fibrin) and those on plastic. Freshly isolated HSC were plated on 10-cm culture dish with 10% FBS in DMEM for 2 days. During this period, HSC retained the quiescent state as monitored by star-shaped morphology with long, prominent dendritic processes and autofluorescence of vitamin A-containing droplets. Then cells were detached by a trypsin/EDTA treatment followed by neutralization by 10% FBS in DMEM. After washing with serum-free DMEM the cells were suspended in 4 ml of DMEM. The cell density was adjusted to 2 × 106/ml. To plate the cells as a monolayer on plastic, 2 ml of the cell suspension was mixed with 18 ml of DMEM containing 10% FBS and seeded of 1 ml in each well of a 24-well plate. Another 2-ml cell suspension was mixed with type I collagen gel mixture as described previously (45Han Y.P. Nien Y.D. Garner W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27319-27327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Briefly, this mixture was prepared by mixing 0.6 ml of 10× minimum essential medium, 0.6 ml of 0.1 n NaOH, 1.4 ml of DMEM, and 4.8 ml of Vitrogen (Cohesion Technologies). An aliquot of 0.4 ml was loaded in the wells of a 24-well plate and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. After forming of lattices, 1 ml of DMEM and 10% FBS were added on top and cultured in 5% CO2 at 37 °C for 6 h. Then the monolayers or lattices were washed gently by DMEM followed by culturing in 1 ml of DMEM (0.5% FBS) with cytokines (R&D Systems) as mentioned in the text. To make the fibrin clot, a stock was prepared by mixing 3 ml of 10 mg/ml fibrinogen in DMEM and 1 ml of cell suspension. Aliquots of 5 μl of thrombin (250 units/ml) were preloaded in the wells followed by adding 0.4 ml of the fibrinogen cell mixture. To make Matrigel gel lattices, the stock (BD Biosciences) was diluted twice with cold DMEM followed by mixing with the cell suspension. For some experiments, a sandwich gel was made by placing an additional 0.2-ml matrix layer before loading the collagen lattices on the top. For inhibition experiments, purified recombinant TIMP-1 (CC3328, Chemicon) was applied to the culture. Deprivation of MMP-9 during IL-1α-induced Activation of HSC—Isolated rat HSC were embedded into three-dimensional type I collagen in the bottom chamber of a Transwell (BD Biosciences). 400 μl of gelatin-conjugated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) or the control beads were loaded into the insert chambers. After culture with 20 ng/ml IL-1α for 6 days the cells were fixed for immunostaining of α-SMA. The conditioned medium was examined for gelatinase activities. Zymography—Prior to gel electrophoresis the conditioned medium was briefly centrifuged and mixed with a SDS-PAGE sample buffer in the absence of reducing agents. The conditioned medium was resolved by 10% polyacrylamide separation gel with 0.1% (w/v) gelatin (Sigma). To prepare the casein zymography, the protein was dissolved in 0.01 n NaOH before casting into the gel. Electrophoresis was carried out at 4 °C with 120 volts for 16 h. After electrophoresis, SDS in the gel was deprived by incubation with 2.5% Triton X-100. Proteolytic activities were developed in a buffer containing 5 mm CaCl2, 150 mm NaCl, and 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, for 16 h at 37 °C and visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue R-250. For most of the experiments, 35 μl of the original conditioned medium was resolved by zymogram. To examine the weak activity of MMP-9 from the fully activated HSC (myofibroblast-like HSC), gelatinases from 300 μl of conditioned medium were enriched by pull-down with gelatin-conjugated Sepharose 4B prior to zymography. Western Blot Analysis—Because some components in fetal bovine serum were found to be tightly associated with the collagen matrix and recognized by the secondary antibody in Western blot analysis, quiescent HSC was cultured in serum-free DMEM, and a minimal concentration of PDGF at 0.2 ng/ml was added in the basal medium for culturing fully activated HSC to prevent apoptosis. The conditioned medium was resolved by 12.5% SDS-PAGE, and the protein was transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore). After blotting with 10% nonfat milk, the individual membranes were probed with either anti-rat MMP-13 (mAB13426, Chemicon), MMP-3 (AB19150, Chemicon), TIMP-1 (MS-570, NeoMarkers), or MMP-9 (AB805, Chemicon) overnight. After incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, the membranes were developed by Super Signal West Pico Chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). MMP-9 Activity Assay—The fluorogenic peptide substrate, DNP-Pro-Leu-Gly-Met-Trp-Ser-Arg (Calbiochem), was dissolved in 15% dimethyl sulfoxide. Assays were carried out by incubation of 5 μl of conditioned medium, 45 μl of H2O, 50 μl of 36 μm peptide dilution, and 50 μl of buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 30 mm CaCl2 in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, at 37 °C for 4 h. The hydrolysis of the peptide was measured by the fluorescence at λex = 280 nm and λem = 360 nm in a Hitachi F-2000 spectrofluorometer. Immunohistological Staining—After cultivation the HSC in matrix lattices and on plastic were washed by phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in cold methanol for 20 min for three-dimensional gel and 10 min for monolayers. After three washes the cells were permeabilized by incubation with cold 0.15% Triton X-100 with 0.1% bovine serum albumin (fraction V from Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min. After treatment with blocking solution containing 5% bovine serum albumin for 60 min, the staining was performed by incubation of 1:200 dilution of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated monoclonal antibody against α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA, Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline with 5% bovine serum albumin fro 16 h at 4 °C. After three washes, the nuclei were stained by 0.1 μg/ml DAPI for 10 min. For some experiments the colorimetric staining with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and AEC substrates (Labvision) were used. The cells were viewed using a Nikon microscope equipped with digital camera available at the Imaging Core of the USC Research Center for Liver Diseases. To examine the colocalization of MMP-9 and α-SMA, a dual immunofluorescence staining was performed onto human fibrotic liver biopsies by the Morphology Core of the Research Center for Alcoholic Liver and Pancreatic Diseases with approved IRB protocol. Briefly, a paraffin block was sectioned at a thickness of 5 μm followed by a dewaxing process. After hydration, the slides were treated with 0.1% trypsin at 37 °C for 30 min and then blocked by a solution containing 5% skim milk (BD Biosciences), 0.25% serum, and 1% bovine serum albumin (EM Science). The slides were incubated with rabbit antibodies for human MMP-9 (AB805, Chemicon) (1:300) and mouse monoclonal antibody for α-SMA (1:300) in the blocking solution for 16 h at 4 °C. After washing of the slides the fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG were applied at a dilution of 1:400. Before mounting, the slides were stained with 1 μg/ml DAPI. Induction and Activation of MMP-9 during IL-1α-induced Activation of HSC in ECMs—A general design of this study was to establish a three-dimensional culture of HSC by embedding isolated quiescent HSC in ECM matrix and to examine cytokine regulation of MMPs and HSC activation. We first tested type I collagen gel because this model was shown to recapitulate best the quiescent morphology of HSC in vivo (31Imai K. Senoo H. Anat. Rec. 1998; 250: 430-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). HSC were isolated from rats and plated on a plastic dish with medium containing 10% FBS for 2 days. More than 95% of the cells retained the quiescent phenotype of HSC as judged by perinuclear retinoid droplets and star-shaped morphology with prominent dendritic protrusion. Then the cells were either reseeded on plastic as a monolayer or embedded in the reconstituted fibrillar type I collagen. The cells were cultured in basal medium with an increasing concentration of IL-1α. After an additional 6 days of culture in the absence of IL-1α, the cells in three-dimensional collagen retained a quiescent state with intracellular vitamin A droplets and the absence of α-SMA immunoreactivity (Fig. 1A). Treatment of HSC with IL-1α induced apparent trans-differentiation of the quiescent HSC into myofibroblast-like cells with the formation of α-SMA-positive fibers. The initial induction of α-SMA for monolayer and three-dimensional-collagen was evident at 0.2 and 2 ng/ml, respectively. At the concentration of 20 ng/ml, IL-1α brought formation of heavy bundles of stress fiber in the cells. Gelatinolytic activities in the conditioned medium were resolved and are shown in Fig. 1B. To our surprise, robust gelatinase activities with a molecular mass of 105-95-kDa were produced by IL-1α-treated HSC in three-dimensional collagen. In contrast, IL-1α or three-dimensional collagen matrix alone was without effect. The 105-kDa gelatinase represents the rat pro-MMP-9 with a prodomain of ∼100 amino acid residues. The 95-kDa gelatinase is regarded as the active form of rat MMP-9 generated by the cleavage of the prodomain. In fact, only pro-MMP-9 was generated when the cells were treated with a low concentration of IL-1α (0.2 ng/ml). Further, after a continued culture for 6 days with IL-1α, the collagen gel was completely degraded, suggesting that fibrillar collagenase activities were induced by IL-1α (Fig. 1C). We also assessed serine proteinase activities by casein zymography. As shown in Fig. 1D, a major serine proteinase with an approximate molecular size of 75-kDa was expressed at the basal state in the collagen lattice, and the treatment with IL-1α induced the generation of a lower molecular mass serine proteinase, presumably through an activation process. To address the concern that cellular contaminants such as Kupffer cells may provide the source of MMP-9, we performed detailed histological analysis of the three-dimensional cultures. The identity and purity of HSC were readily confirmed by UV excited autofluorescence of intracellular retinoids. By this standard, more than 95% of cells were found to be vitamin A-positive. After a 2-day culture in the collagen lattice, the cells were immunostained by the anti-rat MMP-9 monoclonal antibody. As shown in Fig. 1E, MMP-9 immunoreactivity was present only in the cells stimulated with IL-1α. We also confirmed the type IV collagenase activity as MMP-9 by a Western blot analysis of the 6-day cultured medium (Fig. 1F). These results indicate that IL-1α-induced HSC activation in three-dimensional collagen is tightly associated with cytokine-provoked expression and proteolytic activation of multiple ECM proteinases. They also suggest that the breakdown of the ECM which helped maintain the quiescent state of HSC is essential for IL-1α-induced activation of HSC. Conversely, in the absence of ECM framework the HSC grown on plastic readily undergo activation without the need of MMPs. Specific ECM and Cytokines Are Both Required for Pro-MMP-9 Expression and Activation by HSC—We addressed next the specificity of ECM required for the IL-1α-mediated MMP-9 induction and activation. We tested Matrigel, which contains the basement membrane components similar to that found in the space of Disse between HSC and sinusoidal endothelial cells. We also tested fibrin clot, which is frequently present in the early stage of acute wounds. These two matrices were compared with fibrillar type I collagen, which is normally present between HSC and hepatocytes and becomes abundant in fibrotic conditions. Quiescent HSC were embedded in the ECM followed by cytokine stimulation. We found very interesting patterns of cytokine-mediated regulation of MMP-9 expression/activation by the HSC in these matrices. In Matrigel, IL-1α and TNF-α but not TGF-β induced expression of pro-MMP-9. However, the 105-kDa pro-MMP-9 remained as a zymogen without being converted to the active form. When HSC were grown in type I collagen, IL-1α induced pro-MMP-9 expression followed by conversion to the active 95-kDa form, whereas TNF-α failed even to induce pro-MMP-9. In fibrin clot HSC did not secrete MMP-9 in response to all of these cytokines. Thus these results highlight that the ECM, presumably through the specific cellular receptors, can drastically determine the responsiveness of HSC for their cytokine-mediated regulation of MMP-9 expression and activation. IL-1α and Type I Collagen Serve as Costimulatory Signals for Induction of MMP-9 and MMP-13, whereas Collagen Is Not Required for MMP-3 Expression—We evaluated cytokines and ECM on other MMPs represented in fibrosis. As shown in Fig. 3A, we confirmed that dual signals from IL-1α and type I collagen are required for induction and activation of MMP-9. After a prolonged development of the zymogram, we occasionally observed weak induction of pro-MMP-9 by the I"
https://openalex.org/W2026996225,"Mobile light-harvesting complex II (LHCII) is implicated in the regulation of excitation energy distribution between Photosystem I (PSI) and Photosystem II (PSII) during state transitions. To investigate how LHCII interacts with PSI during state transitions, PSI was isolated from Arabidopsis thaliana plants treated with PSII or PSI light. The PSI preparations were made using digitonin. Chemical cross-linking using dithio-bis(succinimidylpropionate) followed by diagonal electrophoresis and immunoblotting showed that the docking site of LHCII (Lhcb1) on PSI is comprised of the PSI-H, -L, and -I subunits. This was confirmed by the lack of energy transfer from LHCII to PSI in the digitonin-PSI isolated from plants lacking PSI-H and -L. Digitonin-PSI was purified further to obtain an LHCII·PSI complex, and two to three times more LHCII was associated with PSI in the wild type in State 2 than in State 1. Lhcb1 was also associated with PSI from plants lacking PSI-K, but PSI from PSI-H, -L, or -O mutants contained only about 30% of Lhcb1 compared with the wild type. Surprisingly, a significant fraction of the LHCII bound to PSI in State 2 was not phosphorylated. Cross-linking prior to sucrose gradient purification resulted in copurification of phosphorylated LHCII in the wild type, but not with PSI from the PSI-H, -L, and -O mutants. The data suggest that migration of LHCII during state transitions cannot be explained sufficiently by different affinity of phosphorylated and unphosphorylated LHCII for PSI but is likely to involve structural changes in thylakoid organization.

PSI is also involved in cyclic electron transport without the participation of PSII, and this process serves to produce additional ATP and to regulate the transthylakoidal proton gradient (1Munekage Y. Hojo M. Meurer J. Endo T. Tasaka M. Shikanai T. Cell. 2002; 110: 361-371Google Scholar), but in plants this is a minor part of the electron transport. In linear electron transport, PSI and PSII must operate with the same rate, but natural environmental conditions, such as the quality and quantity of light, are constantly fluctuating, and this may alter the balance between the two photosystems. The two photosystems have different absorption spectra, and therefore a change in light quality may favor one photosystem over the other. However, plants can balance the excitation energy distribution between the two photosystems via a mechanism known as state transitions, which was discovered more than 30 years ago (2Bonaventura C. Myers J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 189: 366-383Google Scholar, 3Murata N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 172: 242-251Google Scholar, 4Allen J.F. Science. 2003; 299: 1530-1532Google Scholar). If PSII is overexcited relative to PSI, the plastoquinone pool becomes overreduced, and this will activate a kinase that phosphorylates a mobile pool of light-harvesting complex II (LHCII), leading to the lateral movement of LHCII in favor of PSI. This is the so-called “State 2,” in which the PSII antenna is smaller and the PSI antenna is larger than in State 1 (5Lunde C. Jensen P.E. Haldrup A. Knoetzel J. Scheller H.V. Nature. 2000; 408: 613-615Google Scholar, 6Allen J.F. Forsberg J. Trends Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 317-326Google Scholar). State 1 is obtained when PSI is preferentially excited, which leads to oxidation of the plastoquinone pool and inactivation of the LHCII kinase. The phospho-LHCII is then dephosphorylated by a redox-independent phosphatase and moves back to PSII. Although the phenomenon of state transitions has been recognized for a long time, there is still considerable uncertainty about the mechanism. Two models have been proposed to explain the movement of LHCII. According to one model, alteration in the surface charge upon phosphorylation leads to structural changes of the thylakoid membrane and results in the movement of phospho-LHCII away from grana stacks (7Barber J. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1982; 33: 261-295Google Scholar, 8Bennett J. Biochem. J. 1983; 212: 1-13Google Scholar, 9Bennett J. Physiol. Plant. 1984; 60: 583-590Google Scholar). According to another model, the net movement of LHCII toward PSI in State 2 is caused by PSII with higher affinity for unphosphorylated LHCII and PSI with higher affinity for phospho-LHCII, therefore movement of phospho-LHCII is a question of molecular recognition (6Allen J.F. Forsberg J. Trends Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 317-326Google Scholar). Although the models differ in the way of explaining state transitions, they both involve phosphorylation of LHCII as a prerequisite for the initiation of State 1–State 2 transitions. A search for kinases involved in the phosphorylation of thylakoid proteins has been carried out by many workers for more than 20 years. A family of proteins, thylakoid-associated kinases, was identified as good candidates for LHCII kinases (10Snyders S. Kohorn B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9137-9140Google Scholar, 11Snyders S. Kohorn B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32169-32176Google Scholar). The antisense Arabidopsis plants with low amounts of thylakoid-associated kinase 1 showed a lower level of LHCII phosphorylation and were deficient in state transitions, but the phosphorylation of LHCII was distributed equally between PSII and PSI under white light, which was also the case in wild type plants (11Snyders S. Kohorn B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32169-32176Google Scholar). This indicates that the correlation between LHCII phosphorylation and state transition is complex. Recently, Depege et al. (12Depege N. Bellafiore S. Rochaix J.D. Science. 2003; 299: 1572-1575Google Scholar) reported a novel kinase in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, thylakoid-associated serine-threonine protein kinase, and demonstrated that it is required for the phosphorylation of LHCII and for state transitions. photosystem I and photosystem II chlorophyll β-dodecyl maltoside PSI prepared after DM solubilization dithio-bis(succinimidylpropionate) maximum fluorescent yield photosystem I light (red light) photosystem II light (orange light) light-harvesting complex of photosystem II and photosystem I, respectively N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. LHCII consists of three different proteins, Lhcb1, Lhcb2, and Lhcb3. Lhcb1 and Lhcb2 are the most abundant and can form Lhcb1 homotrimers and Lhcb1/2 heterotrimers, which are believed to be a mobile complex (13Larsson U.K. Anderson J.M. Andersson B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 894: 69-75Google Scholar, 14Jackowski G. Kacprzak K. Jansson S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1504: 340-345Google Scholar). Both proteins usually exist in several very similar isoforms, but specific isoforms are not well conserved between species, indicating that they probably are redundant rather than having specific functions. However, this is another unclear point because it is not known whether there are biochemical differences between the mobile and nonmobile LHCII apart from the reversible phosphorylation described above. Electron microscopy studies have revealed that PSII core complexes are found as dimers surrounded by LHCII trimers (15Boekema E.J. van Roon H. van Breemen J.F.L. Dekker J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 444-452Google Scholar, 16Boekema E.J. van Roon H. van Breemen J.F.L. Dekker J.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2233-2239Google Scholar, 17Boekema E.J. van Roon H. van Breemen J.F.L. Dekker J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 1123-1133Google Scholar, 18Yakushevska A.E. Jensen P.E. Keegstra W. van Roon H. Scheller H.V. Boekema E.J. Dekker J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 6020-6028Google Scholar). There are specific binding sites for the trimers, but the number of trimers/PSII complex differs depending on species and growth conditions. Generally, strongly bound, intermediately bound, and loosely bound trimers can be recognized. In contrast to the situation with PSII, the binding site of LHCII on PSI is not known. PSI is composed of a multisubunit core complex (PSI core) and outer antenna, the light-harvesting complex I (LHCI). The PSI core complex in higher plants consists of 14 different subunits (PSI-A to PSI-L, PSI-N) (19Chitnis P.R. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 52: 593-626Google Scholar, 20Scheller H.V. Jensen P.E. Haldrup A. Lunde C. Knoetzel J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1507: 41-60Google Scholar) and a recently discovered subunit PSI-O (21Knoetzel J. Mant A. Haldrup A. Jensen P.E. Scheller H.V. FEBS Lett. 2002; 510: 145-148Google Scholar). LHCI is composed of four different subunits of about 21–24 kDa, Lhca1 to Lhca4. The association between LHCII and PSI is relatively weak, and a stable complex is difficult to purify. Early studies (22Bassi R. Simpson D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 163: 221-230Google Scholar) suggested that LHCII was bound to LHCI rather than directly to the PSI core, but this conclusion was based on the inability to reconstitute a LHCII·PSI complex using PSI devoid of LHCI-680 (composed of Lhca2 and Lhca3). We now know that preparation of a PSI complex devoid of LHCI is likely to cause the loss of additional small core subunits that were unknown at the time. Electron microscopy studies have revealed that all LHCI subunits bind at the side of PSI-F and PSI-J subunits of the PSI core complex (23Boekema E.J. Jensen P.E. Schlodder E. van Breemen J.F.L. van Roon H. Scheller H.V. Dekker J.P. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1029-1036Google Scholar). Arabidopsis plants lacking PSI-H were highly deficient in state transitions and have identical PSI antenna size in both States 1 and 2, whereas in wild type the antenna size of PSI was found to increase about 33% during transition to State 2 (5Lunde C. Jensen P.E. Haldrup A. Knoetzel J. Scheller H.V. Nature. 2000; 408: 613-615Google Scholar). Therefore we suggested that LHCII binds directly to the PSI core and that PSI-H is part of a docking site (5Lunde C. Jensen P.E. Haldrup A. Knoetzel J. Scheller H.V. Nature. 2000; 408: 613-615Google Scholar). Based on cross-linking and x-ray crystallography data, the PSI-H subunit is positioned close to PSI-L and PSI-I on the opposite side of the PSI core complex compared with PSI-F, PSI-J, and LHCI (24Jansson S. Andersen B. Scheller H.V. Plant Physiol. 1996; 112: 409-420Google Scholar, 25Jordan P. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Klukas O. Saenger W. Krauss N. Nature. 2001; 411: 909-917Google Scholar). However, until now, no direct biochemical evidence has ever been found for the association of LHCII to PSI during state transitions. To investigate how LHCII interacts with PSI during state transitions, we purified LHCII·PSI complex from wild type Arabidopsis in State 1 and State 2, and we also used mutants lacking the PSI-H, -L, -O, or -K subunits to determine the docking sites for LHCII. The results indicate that PSI-H, -L, -O, and -I all participate in forming the docking site. Furthermore, the results show that both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated LHCII are associated with PSI in State 2. Plant Materials—Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heyhn ecotype Col-0 was used for all experiments. Plants were grown in peat in a controlled environment Arabidopsis chamber (Percival AR-60L, Boone, IA) at a photosynthetic flux of 100–120 μmol photons m–2 s–1, 20 °C, 70% relative humidity. The photoperiod was 8 h. Transformants lacking specific PSI subunits were obtained by antisense or cosuppression and have been reported before (5Lunde C. Jensen P.E. Haldrup A. Knoetzel J. Scheller H.V. Nature. 2000; 408: 613-615Google Scholar, 26Naver H. Haldrup A. Scheller H.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10784-10789Google Scholar, 27Jensen P.E. Gilpin M. Knoetzel J. Scheller H.V. J.

P. Zhang, D. Leister, and H. V. Scheller, unpublished data. Light Treatment—Colored filters were used in the experiments to provide PSII light (L2) and PSI light (L1) essentially as described by Pfannschmidt et al. (29Pfannschmidt T. Nilsson A. Allen J.F. Nature. 1999; 397: 625-628Google Scholar). PSII light was obtained with an orange filter (Rosco, 105 orange, Teadon Aps, Stenløse, Denmark), and PSI light was obtained with a red filter (HT 027 medium red, LEE Filters, Andover, UK). Gray filter (209 neutral density, LEE Filters) was used to adjust the light coming through the orange filter to a level similar to that through the red filter (50–70 μmol photons m–2 s–1). The filters were mounted in a controlled environment chamber equipped with 400-watt Powertone HPI-T Plus lamps (Philips). Six-week-old wild type plants were exposed to PSI or PSII light for 1 h prior to harvesting of leaves. Plants lacking PSI-H, -L, -O, or -K subunits were treated with PSII light for 1 h. State Transitions in Leaves—State transitions were measured with a pulse amplitude modulation 101–103 fluorometer (Walz, Effeltrich, Germany) in the growth chamber equipped with filters as described above. Plants were dark-adapted for 30 min before the measurements. A detached leaf from a wild type plant was fixed to the light fiber, which was positioned so the leaf was horizontal and received the same irradiation as the plants used for preparation of thylakoids. Maximum fluorescence yield (Fm) was determined by exposing the leaf to a saturating flash (0.8 s, 6000 μmol photons m–2 s–1). The leaf was then exposed to orange light (which favors PSII, L2) for about 20 min, and the maximum fluorescence yield in State 2 (Fm2) was determined. The fiber with the leaf was then transferred rapidly to the red light (which favors PSI, L1), and after 20 min the maximum fluorescence yield (Fm1) was measured. The leaf was then exposed to orange light for another 20 min and finally kept in darkness. The difference of maximal fluorescence in State 1 and State 2 was calculated as Fm1/Fm2. The relative change in fluorescence was calculated as in Equation 1 (5Lunde C. Jensen P.E. Haldrup A. Knoetzel J. Scheller H.V. Nature. 2000; 408: 613-615Google Scholar, 30Haldrup A. Jensen P.E. Lunde C. Scheller H.V. Trends Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 301-305Google Scholar),Fr=((Fi'-Fi)-(Fii'-Fii))/(Fi'-Fi)(Eq. 1) where Fi and Fii designate fluorescence in the presence of PSI light in State 1 and State 2, respectively, and Fi′ and Fii′ designate fluorescence in the absence of PSI light in State 1 and State 2, respectively (see Fig. 1). Isolation of DM-PSI (β-Dodecyl Maltoside-solubilized PSI) and Digitonin-PSI—After plants were treated with light as described above, rosette leaves were rapidly harvested and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Thylakoids were prepared as described previously (31Haldrup A. Naver H. Scheller H.V. Plant J. 1999; 17: 689-698Google Scholar) except that all solutions contained 10 mm NaF to inhibit phosphatase. DM-PSI was isolated according to Jensen et al. (27Jensen P.E. Gilpin M. Knoetzel J. Scheller H.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24701-24708Google Scholar). The sucrose gradients were prepared by freezing and thawing at 4 °C of 11 ml of 0.6 m sucrose, 20 mm Tricine-NaOH, pH 7.5, 0.06% DM, and 10 mm NaF. Digitonin-PSI was prepared by solubilizing thylakoids (0.5 mg of Chl/ml) with digitonin (final concentration 0.5% (w/v)) for 30 min at 4 °C with stirring, followed by centrifugation at 48,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was centrifuged at 257,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 20 mm Tricine, pH 7.5, 20% glycerol, 10 mm NaF, and the samples (digitonin-PSI) were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C until use. The Chl concentration and Chl a/b ratio were determined in 80% acetone (32Lichtenthaler H.K. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 148: 350-382Google Scholar). Preparation of LHCII·PSI Complex—For preparing pure LHCII·PSI complex, the digitonin-PSI preparations were diluted to 0.3 mg of Chl/ml in 20 mm Tricine, pH 7.5, 0.3% (w/v) DM, 10 mm NaF. Half of the preparation was treated with chemical cross-linker dithio-bis(succinimidylpropionate) (DTSP) on a shaker for 30 min at 22 °C in darkness as described previously (24Jansson S. Andersen B. Scheller H.V. Plant Physiol. 1996; 112: 409-420Google Scholar). After incubation with 0.015% (w/v) DTSP at room temperature for 30 min in darkness, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 1/7 volume of 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA. The DTSP-treated and the control samples were applied to sucrose gradients containing 0.06% (w/v) DM and centrifuged as described above. The LHCII bands and LHCII·PSI complex bands were collected with syringes, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C. Analysis of Phosphate Content—Phosphate content of LHCII in State 2 was analyzed according to Martensen (33Martensen T.M. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 107: 3-23Google Scholar). First the purified LHCII preparations were ashed to convert protein-bound phosphate to inorganic phosphate, then the inorganic phosphate was measured by absorbance at 660 nm in a microtiter plate reader after complexation of ammonium molybdate with malachite green. The standard curve was made with KH2PO4 (0–1 nmol). The content of phosphate in LHCII·PSI in State 2 was determined by immunoblotting using the phosphothreonine antibody and comparing with a dilution series of LHCII with known content of phosphate. SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—All the gels used were home-made 8–25% gradient gels prepared according to Fling and Gregerson (34Fling S.P. Gregerson D.S. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 155: 83-88Google Scholar), except that the first dimension of diagonal electrophoresis was on 12% homogeneous gels. All samples were loaded on Chl basis. Immunoblotting was carried out by transferring the electrophoretically separated proteins to nitrocellulose membranes followed by incubation with different polyclonal antibodies and detection with the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). To determine the composition of cross-linked products on one-dimensional gels, the nitrocellulose strip for each lane was cut into two sections and incubated with two different antibodies. In this way the two sections could be aligned exactly. To determine the relative content of Lhcb1, Lhcb2, and phosphothreonine in the LHCII·PSI complexes each sample was electrophoresed together with a dilution series of known amounts of LHCII to ensure that the response on the immunoblots was in a linear range. Quantitation was carried out by scanning the x-ray films and analyzing them using the ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Polyclonal antibodies against PSI proteins were prepared in rabbits and have been described before (21Knoetzel J. Mant A. Haldrup A. Jensen P.E. Scheller H.V. FEBS Lett. 2002; 510: 145-148Google Scholar, 35Andersen B. Koch B. Scheller H.V. Physiol. Plant. 1992; 84: 154-161Google Scholar). Antibodies against Lhcb1 and Lhcb2 were kind gifts of S. Jansson, Umeå University, Sweden. Antibodies against phosphothreonine were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Beverly, MA). Diagonal Electrophoresis—The digitonin-PSI preparations (treated with PSII light) were diluted to 0.3 mg of Chl/ml in 20 mm Tricine, pH 7.5, 0.3% (w/v) DM, and 10 mm NaF. Chemical cross-linking with DTSP was carried out as described above. The cross-linked samples were mixed with 1 volume of nonreducing sample buffer (50 mm Na2CO3, 15% w/v sucrose, 2.5% (w/v) SDS), the solution was incubated for 20 min at room temperature, and loaded on the first dimension 12% gel. After electrophoresis, the lanes were cut out and incubated for 30 min in reducing sample buffer (50 mm Na2CO3, 15% sucrose, 2.5% SDS, and 50 mm dithiothreitol) to obtain complete reductive cleavage of the cross-linked products. The gel slice was placed on top of a second 8–25% gradient gel and reelectrophoresed. P700 Photooxidation Measurements—The photooxidation kinetics of P700 were monitored with the absorbance changes at 810 nm with 860 nm as reference (ΔA810–860) using the dual wavelength unit ED-P700DW of a PAM 101–103 fluorometer (Walz) as described by Bukhov et al. (36Bukhov N. Egorova E. Carpentier R. Planta. 2002; 215: 812-820Google Scholar) with some modifications. Actinic light from a KL1500 halogen lamp (Schott, Mainz, Germany) with different light intensities was controlled by an electronic shutter, which opened for 1 s with 40-s intervals. Digitonin-PSI preparations (15 μg of Chl) were diluted to a total volume of 500 μl in 50 mm Tricine buffer, pH 7.5, 0.01% (w/v) digitonin, and 0.5 mm ascorbate and 0.05 mm methyl viologen were added prior to measurements. Ascorbate was used to ensure complete reduction of P700 in the dark, and methyl viologen to prevent the back-reaction from PSI acceptors. The output signal from the fluorometer was passed to an oscilloscope where averaging of signals was performed. The half-life (t½) was calculated after fitting of exponential curves to the absorption curves. State Transitions in the Growth Chamber—To make sure that we chose the right light conditions to do the following experiments, we first tested whether the plants performed state transitions in the growth chamber. To induce state transitions, we equipped a growth chamber with orange and red filters for preferential excitation of PSII and PSI, respectively. The light intensity passing through the filters was about 50–70 μmol photons m–2 s–1, The plants were dark-adapted for 30 min before measuring the maximum fluorescence signal (Fm), and subsequently the leaves were exposed to orange light (L2, which favors PSII) for 20 min (Fig. 1). After the steady-state fluorescence level was reached, the maximal fluorescence in State 2 (Fm2) was determined. Then State 1 was induced by illuminating with red light (L1, which favors PSI) for 20 min, and the maximal fluorescence in State 1 (Fm1) was determined. To quantify state transitions we determined Fm1 and Fr (30Haldrup A. Jensen P.E. Lunde C. Scheller H.V. Trends Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 301-305Google Scholar). For wild type Arabidopsis plants, the value of Fm1/Fm2 was determined as 1.19 ± 0.03, and Fr as 0.86 ± 0.05 (± S.D., n = 4). The values are in good agreement with Haldrup et al. (30Haldrup A. Jensen P.E. Lunde C. Scheller H.V. Trends Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 301-305Google Scholar), who got the numbers 1.051 ± 0.005 and 0.851 ± 0.034 at a light intensity of 80 μmol photons m–2 s–1 using a conventional setup. This indicates that the right experimental conditions were established for performing state transitions in our growth chamber. Detergent Solubilization and Purification of PSI—From plants exposed to different light conditions we first used DM to solubilize thylakoids and then isolate PSI from sucrose gradients. As shown in Fig. 2A (lanes 1 and 2) the isolated PSI did contain all known higher plant PSI subunits but did not have any detectable LHCII attached both in State 1 and in State 2. The absence of LHCII in DM-PSI was confirmed by immunoblotting (data not shown). This demonstrates that the association between LHCII and PSI is weak and could be disrupted during solubilization with DM. Therefore, we used a milder solubilization with the nonionic detergent digitonin instead of DM and without running sucrose gradients. The resulting preparations were highly enriched in PSI and contained large amounts of LHCII (Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and 4). However, the preparations are obviously not pure PSI but also contain some PSII. Thus, we could not at this point determine how large a fraction of the LHCII was actually associated with PSI. However, it is clear that the LHCII isolated together with PSI was much more phosphorylated in State 2 than in State 1 (Fig. 2B). This result further confirmed that the reversible phosphorylation was functional under the chosen light conditions and that state transitions were induced. Chemical Cross-linking and Diagonal Electrophoresis—To determine whether LHCII in the digitonin-PSI preparation was associated with PSI and to investigate the possible docking sites of LHCII on PSI, we employed chemical cross-linking, diagonal electrophoresis, and immunoblotting. Lunde et al. (5Lunde C. Jensen P.E. Haldrup A. Knoetzel J. Scheller H.V. Nature. 2000; 408: 613-615Google Scholar) suggested that LHCII may bind to PSI-H and PSI-L. To test this possibility, digitonin-PSI was cross-linked with DTSP, subjected to SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions, and electroblotted to nitrocellulose membranes. Two cross-linked products could be clearly identified with an antibody against Lhcb1 (Fig. 3A, lane 1). One cross-linked product (Fig. 3, A and B, Δ) with an apparent molecular mass of ∼30 kDa, was most probably a product of PSI-I and Lhcb1 because an antibody against PSI-I identified a product of the same size. Previous work has shown that cross-linking products migrate with apparent molecular masses corresponding to the combined molecular masses of the individual proteins (24Jansson S. Andersen B. Scheller H.V. Plant Physiol. 1996; 112: 409-420Google Scholar), and 30 kDa is in excellent agreement with the combined molecular masses of Lhcb1 (25 kDa) and PSI-I (4 kDa). The other cross-linked product (Fig. 3A, *) had an apparent molecular mass of 55–60 kDa. Antibodies against PSI-I, PSI-L, and PSI-H reacted with a band of exactly the same size. The combined molecular mass of Lhcb1, PSI-I, PSI-H, and PSI-L is 57 kDa, and the data therefore indicate that the immunoreactive cross-linking product is a product of these four proteins. The previously described (24Jansson S. Andersen B. Scheller H.V. Plant Physiol. 1996; 112: 409-420Google Scholar) cross-linking products involving PSI-L+H (28 kDa), PSI-L+I (22 kDa), and PSI-H+I (14 kDa) are also clearly seen on the blot. With an antibody against Lhcb2 a cross-linking product with apparent molecular mass of around 50 kDa (▿) was observed (Fig. 3C). However, this product is clearly smaller than the cross-linking product involving PSI-I, -L, and -H, and it may correspond to an Lhcb2 dimer. A well known problem with using antibodies against cross-linked proteins is that epitopes may be lost because of the cross-linking (24Jansson S. Andersen B. Scheller H.V. Plant Physiol. 1996; 112: 409-420Google Scholar). However, with a cleavable cross-linker such as DTSP this problem can largely be overcome by electrophoresing the cleaved cross-linked products in a second dimension. To confirm the above conclusions further, the gel slices after the first dimension were therefore cut out, incubated with reducing sample buffer to cleave the cross-linked products completely, and reelectrophoresed. In the first dimension, cross-linked products will migrate approximately according to the combined apparent molecular mass, but after cleavage the previously linked proteins will migrate separately according to their normal apparent molecular masses and therefore form vertically aligned spots in the second dimension (24Jansson S. Andersen B. Scheller H.V. Plant Physiol. 1996; 112: 409-420Google Scholar). Proteins that are not cross-linked will migrate to the same position in both dimensions and thus form a diagonal in the final gel. The blot in Fig. 4A confirms that Lhcb1 formed two cross-linked products of 30 and 55–60 kDa. The 55–60-kDa product is clearly resolved into Lhcb1 (25 kDa) and PSI-L (14 kDa; note that the protein migrates faster than the actual molecular mass of 18 kDa). PSI-H (10 kDa) is also vertically positioned under Lhcb1 and PSI-L corresponding to 55–60 kDa in the first dimension (Fig. 4B), and the spots of PSI-L and PSI-H can be resolved into two cross-linking products. One might be Lhcb1/PSI-L/PSI-H, and another might be Lhcb1/PSI-L/PSI-H plus PSI-I (4 kDa). The presence of PSI-I in the 60-kDa product could not be confirmed in the second dimension, probably because of the lower sensitivity of the PSI-I antibody. The product of ∼30 kDa is seen to consist of large amounts of Lhcb1 t"
https://openalex.org/W2118731883,"A novel method employing filter arrays of a cDNA expression library for the identification of substrates for protein kinases was developed. With this technique, we identified a new member of the cyclin family, cyclin L2, as a substrate of the nuclear protein kinase DYRK1A. Cyclin L2 contains an N-terminal cyclin domain and a C-terminal arginine/serine-rich domain (RS domain), which is a hallmark of many proteins involved in pre-mRNA processing. The gene for cyclin L2 encodes the full-length cyclin L2, which is predominantly expressed in testis, as well as a truncated splicing variant (cyclin L2S) that lacks the RS domain and is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues. Full-length cyclin L2, but not cyclin L2S, was associated with the cyclin-dependent kinase PITSLRE. Cyclin L2 interacted with splicing factor 2 in vitro and was co-localized with the splicing factor SC35 in the nuclear speckle compartment. Photobleaching experiments showed that a fusion protein of green fluorescent protein and cyclin L2 in nuclear speckles rapidly exchanged with unbleached molecules in the nucleus, similar to other RS domain-containing proteins. In striking contrast, the closely related green fluorescent protein-cyclin L1 was immobile in the speckle compartment. DYRK1A interacted with cyclin L2 in pull-down assays, and overexpression of DYRK1A stimulated phosphorylation of cyclin L2 in COS-7 cells. These data characterize cyclin L2 as a highly mobile component of nuclear speckles and suggest that DYRK1A may regulate splicing by phosphorylation of cyclin L2.

DYRK1A (dual specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A) is a nuclear protein kinase that appears to play an important role in brain development (for a review, see Ref. 1Hämmerle B. Elizalde C. Galceran J. Becker W. Tejedor F.J. J. Neural Transm. Suppl. 2003; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The first evidence for a role of DYRK1A in neurogenesis came from its similarity with the Drosophila orthologue, the minibrain kinase (2Tejedor F. Zhu X.R. Kaltenbach E. Ackermann A. Baumann A.

Consistent with a potential involvement of the DYRK1A gene in the pathogenesis of mental retardation in Down syndrome, overexpression of DYRK1A in transgenic mice causes learning deficits and neurodevelopmental alterations (5Smith D.J.

Furthermore, mice heterozygous for a targeted deletion of the Dyrk1a gene (Dyrk1a+/- mice) develop abnormal brain morphology (7Fotaki V. Dierssen M. Alcantara S. Martinez S. Marti E. Casas C. Visa J. Soriano E. Estivill X. Arbones M.L. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 6636-6647Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). In early embryonal development, DYRK1A is expressed in neural progenitor cells during the transition from proliferating to neurogenic divisions (8Hämmerle B. Vera-Samper E. Speicher S. Arencibia R. Martinez S. Tejedor F.J. Dev. Biol. 2002; 246: 259-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Altogether, these findings suggest a relevant function of DYRK1A during neuronal development, related to proliferation and/or differentiation. In recent years, several transcription factors have been identified as substrates of DYRK1A (for a review, see Ref. 9Galceran J. de Graaf K. Tejedor F.J. Becker W. J. Neural Transm. Suppl. 2003; (in press)Google Scholar). Particularly, overexpression of DYRK1A has been shown to modulate the transactivation potential of FKHR (forkhead in rhabdomyosarcoma) (10Woods Y.L. Rena G.

However, although DYRK1A contains a canonical nuclear localization signal and is indeed predominantly targeted to the nucleus (16Song W.J. Chung S.H. Kurnit D.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 231: 640-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 17Becker W. Weber Y. Wetzel K. Eirmbter K. Tejedor F.J. Joost H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25893-25902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), a significant fraction of the kinase is also present in the cytoplasm (18Marti E. Altafaj X. Dierssen M. de la Luna S. Fotaki V. Alvarez M. Perez-Riba M. Ferrer I. Estivill X. Brain Res. 2003; 964: 250-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Within the nucleus, DYRK1A is localized in “nuclear speckles,” which represent the splicing factor compartment (17Becker W. Weber Y. Wetzel K. Eirmbter K. Tejedor F.J. Joost H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25893-25902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 19Álvarez M. Estivill X. De La Luna S. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3099-3107Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The precise function of DYRK1A in the nucleus is still largely unknown, and it is an open question whether any of the known substrates of DYRK1A is a key mediator of its functions on cell differentiation and proliferation. We have therefore performed a more extensive search for interacting proteins and substrates to address this problem. Several methods have been employed to identify novel substrates of protein kinases. Routine interaction screens like the yeast two-hybrid system, phage display, and phage expression library screening, yield in many cases substrates of kinases (20Yang X. Hubbard E.J. Carlson M. Science. 1992; 25: 680-682Crossref Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 21Chen Z. Indjeian V.B. McManus M. Wang L. Dynlacht B.D. Dev.

Cell. 2003; 5: 127-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Other approaches are based on the specificity of substrate recognition by kinases and aim to identify substrate proteins by searching data bases with experimentally determined or predicted consensus phosphorylation sequences (24Yaffe M.B. Leparc G.G. Lai J. Obata T. Volinia S. Cantley L.C. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 25Brinkworth R.I. Breinl R.A. Kobe B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 74-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). More direct strategies include the phosphorylation screening of phage expression libraries (26Fukunaga R. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1921-1933Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar) or of cell lysates (27Knebel A. Morrice N. Cohen P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4360-4369Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), and the identification of phosphoproteins by functional proteomics and mass spectrometry (28Lewis T.S. Hunt J.B. Aveline L.D. Jonscher K.R. Louie D.F. Yeh J.M. Nahreini T.S. Resing K.A. Ahn N.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1343-1454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Here we have employed a new method which allowed us to screen in parallel for interaction partners and substrates of the kinase DYRK1A. In this approach, we used an arrayed protein expression library (29Büssow K. Cahill D. Nietfeld W. Bancroft D. Scherzinger E. Lehrach H. Walter G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5007-5008Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 30Büssow K. Nordhoff E. Lübbert C. Lehrach H. Walter G. Genomics. 2000; 65: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) both for interaction screening by overlaying with the radiolabeled recombinant kinase (31Zhao Z. Lim L. Manser E. Methods. 2001; 24: 194-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), and for a substrate screen by solid phase phosphorylation (26Fukunaga R. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1921-1933Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). The use of the filter array allowed us to directly identify positive clones without the need of further rounds of purification. Several DYRK1A-interacting and/or phosphorylated proteins were identified by this approach, and one protein was found in both screens. This protein turned out to be a novel member of the cyclin family and was designated cyclin L2. Here we characterize cyclin L2 as a novel substrate of DYRK1A. Furthermore, we describe the alternative transcripts generated from the cyclin L2 gene and show that full-length cyclin L2, but not the truncated splicing variant cyclin L2S, is co-localized with the splicing factor SC35 in nuclear speckles. Using photobleaching techniques, we demonstrate that cyclin L2 and the closely related isoform, cyclin L1, differ strikingly with regard to their intranuclear mobility. Production of the Filter Array—The construction of the cDNA expression library and the production of high density filter arrays have been described previously (29Büssow K. Cahill D. Nietfeld W. Bancroft D. Scherzinger E. Lehrach H. Walter G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5007-5008Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Human fetal brain cDNA was directionally cloned into the pQE-30NST vector (GenBank™ accession number AF074376) for isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible expression of His6-tagged fusion proteins. The filter array (22 × 22 cm) used in the present study contained a library of 37,830 double-spotted plasmid clones (library number 800; RZPD, Berlin, Germany) that were enriched for putative expression clones as described earlier (29Büssow K. Cahill D. Nietfeld W. Bancroft D. Scherzinger E. Lehrach H. Walter G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5007-5008Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The colonies were lysed by alkali treatment (0.5 m NaOH, 1.5 m NaCl, 10 min), and the filter was neutralized for 2 × 5 min in 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1.5 m NaCl. Bacterial debris was carefully wiped off in TBS 1The abbreviations used are: TBSTris-buffered salineCDKcyclin-dependent kinaseFLIPfluorescence loss in photobleachingFRAPfluorescence recovery after photobleachingGFPgreen fluorescent proteinGSTglutathione S-transferasePBSphosphate-buffered salineRS domainarginine- and serine-rich domainBSAbovine serum albuminDH boxDYRK homology box. supplemented with 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 (TBS contains 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl), and then the filter was washed twice for 10 min in TBS with 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 and once for 10 min in TBS.

Probe Labeling for Overlay Assays—The probe for the interaction screen, GST-DYRK1A-ΔC-K188R, was expressed from the pGEX-2TK vector (GenBank™ accession number U13851), which allows labeling of the fusion protein on a vector-encoded phosphorylation site by cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The C-terminally truncated mutant of DYRK1A was used as a probe in order to avoid potential nonspecific binding of the repeat structures in the C-terminal domain of DYRK1A (32Kentrup H. Becker W. Heukelbach J. Wilmes A. Schürmann A. Huppertz C. Kainulainen H. Joost H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3488-3495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The kinase-negative point mutant (K188R) of DYRK1A should exhibit enhanced enzyme-substrate interactions. For labeling, 20–25 μg of GST-DYRK1A-ΔC-K188R bound to glutathione S-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) were incubated in a volume of 110 μl with 10 units of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (New England Biolabs) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 6 mg/ml dithiothreitol for 30 min at 4 °C in the presence of 45 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol). The reaction was stopped by adding 10 mm EDTA to a final concentration of 2 mm. The Sepharose beads were then washed seven times with 500 μl of ice-cold PBST (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4, 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100) in order to remove free [γ-32P]ATP. The labeled protein was then eluted for 10 min on ice in 500 μl of glutathione elution buffer (10 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). The typical yield of this reaction was about 15 μCi of incorporated 32P in the eluted protein. Interaction Screening by DYRK1A Overlay—In order to allow refolding of denatured proteins (33Takayama S. Reed J.C. Methods Mol. Biol. 1997; 69: 171-184PubMed Google Scholar), the filter array or nitrocellulose membranes with electroblotted proteins were first incubated for 1 h at room temperature in 6 m guanidinium HCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA and then rinsed with TBS, followed by an overnight incubation at 4 °C in 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 1% BSA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40. To reduce false positive signals due to binding of GST, the membrane was blocked by incubation in interaction buffer (0.5% BSA, 75 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.7, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.05% Nonidet P-40) containing 1 μg/μl GST for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was then incubated with 6 × 104 cpm/ml of 32P-labeled GST-DYRK1A-ΔC-K188R in interaction buffer for 18 h at 4 °C. After washing three times for 10 min each at room temperature with interaction buffer, the membrane was dried and subjected to autoradiography. Substrate Screening by Solid Phase Phosphorylation—The filter with the expression array or polyvinylidene fluoride membranes with electroblotted proteins were preincubated in kinase buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2), 100 mm NaCl, 3% BSA containing 3 μm cold ATP for 1 h at room temperature to mask proteins with autophosphorylating and/or ATP-binding activities (26Fukunaga R. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1921-1933Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). The solid phase phosphorylation was done by incubation with 0.2 units/ml GST-DYRK1A-ΔC in kinase buffer containing 3 μm [γ-32P]ATP (5 μCi/ml) for 45 min at room temperature. This construct has been shown to have the same substrate specificity but higher activity than the full-length kinase when produced in Escherichia coli (34Himpel S. Tegge W. Frank R. Leder S. Joost H.G. Becker W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2431-2438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). One unit of protein kinase activity was that amount that catalyzed the phosphorylation of 1 nmol of DYRKtide, the standard synthetic peptide substrate (34Himpel S. Tegge W. Frank R. Leder S. Joost H.G. Becker W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2431-2438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), in 1 min in kinase buffer containing 100 μm ATP and 200 μm DYRKtide. After phosphorylation, the membrane was washed twice with 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, once with 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, twice with 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, without Nonidet P-40, once with 1 m HCl, and again twice with 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, each washing step for 10 min. The membrane was air-dried and exposed to x-ray film. Bacterial Expression—The plasmids for bacterial expression of GSTDYRK1A-ΔC (34Himpel S. Tegge W. Frank R. Leder S. Joost H.G. Becker W. J. Biol.

GSTDYRK1A-NT contains amino acids 1–177 of the N terminus of DYRK1A; GST-DYRK1Acat contains amino acids 133–499 of DYRK1A. Plasmids from the human fetal brain expression library that encode His6-tagged fusion proteins (Table I) were obtained from the RZPD Deutsches Ressourcenzentrum für Genomforschung (Berlin, Germany) (for cloning and vector information see, on the World Wide Web, www.rzpd.de, library number 800). The expression plasmids for GST-SF2/ASF and GST-hTRA2β1 were kindly provided by Stefan Stamm (Erlangen, Germany) (36Beil B. Screaton G. Stamm S. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 679-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar).

Proteins were eluted from the beads under native conditions (reduced glutathione or imidazole). His6-tagged cyclin L2 expressed from the pQE-30NST vector (RZPD clone N16596) was purified from inclusion bodies as described previously (37Himpel S. Joost H.G. Becker W. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 274: 138-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The purified protein was refolded by gel filtration through a Sephadex G25 column (NAP™-5 column, Amersham Biosciences) with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl as equilibration and elution buffer. For kinase assays, imidazole was removed from His6-tagged fusion protein by ultrafiltration using Centricon concentrators (Amicon, Beverly, MA). Mammalian Expression—The expression clone for GFP-DYRK1A has been described (17Becker W. Weber Y. Wetzel K. Eirmbter K. Tejedor F.J. Joost H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25893-25902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). GFP-CLK3 was constructed by cloning the insert of pGEX-CLK3 (38Becker W. Kentrup H. Heukelbach J. Joost H.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1312: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) into pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) and expresses C-terminal to the GFP tag amino acids 33–490 of rat CLK3. GFP constructs of cyclin L2 were cloned in pEGFP-C1 and comprise the indicated amino acids C-terminal of GFP (numbered as in Fig. 3A): GFP-CycL2, amino acids 1–520; GFP-CycL2-ΔN, amino acids 223–520; GFP-CycL2S, amino acids 1–220 of cyclin L2 plus 6 specific amino acids as indicated in Fig. 3A. GFP-CycL1 contains the full open reading frame of human cyclin L1 (amino acids 1–526; GenBank™ accession number AF180920). A plasmid for expression of untagged cyclin L2 was generated by deletion of GFP from GFP-CycL2. In Vitro Kinase Assays—For in vitro-kinase assays (Fig. 2), amounts of substrates were adjusted to 750 ng of myelin basic protein (Sigma) according to the intensities of the Coomassie Blue-stained bands on SDS-PAGE. Substrates were incubated for 15 min at 30 °C with 0.5 units/ml GST-DYRK1A-ΔC in kinase buffer supplemented with 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP (66.6 μCi/ml). The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue, and phosphorylated proteins were detected by autoradiography of dried gels. Mass Spectrometry—For identification of DYRK1A phosphorylation sites, His6-tagged cyclin L2 (produced from the RZPD clone N16596) was phosphorylated by GST-DYRK1Acat. In order to maximize the yield of the phosphorylated protein, the reaction was carried out for 1 h and with high amounts of the kinase (1:1 molar ratio). Coomassie-stained bands were cut and processed for analysis by mass spectrometry as described previously (35Himpel S. Panzer P. Eirmbter K. Czajkowska H. Sayed M. Packman L.C. Blundell T. Kentrup H. Grötzinger J. Joost H.G. Becker W. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Northern Blot Analysis—Northern blots containing RNA from different human tissues were purchased from Clontech. For differential detection of the splicing variants of CCNL2 and CCNL1, templates for specific hybridization probes were generated by PCR from a human testis cDNA library (catalog number HL1161x; Clontech). Probe CCNL2-E11 matches the 3′-untranslated region of CCNL2 (nucleotides 1477–2070 in AY037150); probe CCNL2-E6a-5′ matches the 5′-end of exon 6a (nucleotides 663–787 in AK074112); and probe CCNL2-E6a-3′ matches the 3′-end of exon 6a (nucleotides 1913–2600 in AK074112). Probe CCNL1-E14 matches the 3′-end of the coding region of CCNL1 (nucleotides 1237–1660 of AF180920). CCNL1-E7+8 contains exon 7, exon 8, and the intron in between (exon definition by Dickinson et al. (39Dickinson L.A. Edgar A.J. Ehley J. Gottesfeld J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25465-25473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar); nucleotides 39525–39874 of human bac clone AC104411). Probes were labeled with 32P by random oligonucleotide priming, and Northern blots were hybridized at probe concentrations of 1–5 × 106 cpm/ml. PCR Analysis of Cyclin L2 Transcripts—Mouse cDNAs were produced using the First Strand cDNA synthesis kit (Amersham Biosciences). A panel of human cDNAs was purchased from Clontech (Human MTC™ Panel I). For specific detection of the transcripts T1–T3, we combined a common forward primer matching exon 2 (E2for, 5′-ATTCCGGAATGGCTACCGGGCAGGTGTTG-3′) with primers that were specific for either exon 6a (E6arev, 5′-AGTCTAGAGCCAGCCTTCG-3′) or exon 6b (E6brev, 5′-AAGACGTCGGTGCGAAGG-3′). These oligonucleotides were designed to match both the murine and the human mRNA sequences. PCRs were performed with the JumpStart REDAccuTaq™ DNA polymerase (Sigma) at an annealing temperature of 52 °C, each step (denaturing, annealing, polymerization) for 30 s. Products were separated by electrophoresis through 1.5% agarose gels and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. The PCR products amplified from the human cDNAs were hardly detectable by ethidium bromide staining and were therefore evaluated by Southern blot analysis with a probe matching exons 3–5 (nucleotides 301–664 of AY037150). The identity of the PCR products was verified by sequencing. Antibodies—The following antibodies were commercially obtained: monoclonal antibodies for GFP (MBL, Nagoya, Japan), SC35 (Sigma), and phosphothreonine-proline (p-Thr-Pro-101; Cell Signaling Technology) and rabbit polyclonal antibodies for GFP (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) and PITSLRE (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies were purchased from Perbio Science, Bonn, Germany (anti-rabbit IgG) and Amersham Biosciences (anti-mouse IgG). Alexa Red-conjugated secondary antibody for immunofluorescence was obtained from Molecular Probes. An antiserum specific for the long form (see “Results”) of cyclin L2 was raised by immunization of rabbits with a peptide (PYKGSEIRGSRK) corresponding to amino acids 437–448 within the C-terminal serine/arginine-rich (RS) domain (see Fig. 3A). Cell Culture, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblotting—COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium high glucose, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) as suggested by the manufacturer. For detection of phosphorylated proteins, cells were washed twice in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, lysed in 500 μl of boiling SDS lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% (w/v) SDS), and incubated in a boiling water bath at 100 °C for 5 min. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation, and the lysates were diluted with 2 ml of water and 2.5 ml of 2× immunoprecipitation buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PM"
https://openalex.org/W2031397452,"Two different mechanisms for Mg-protoporphyrin monomethyl ester (MgPMe) cyclization are shown to coexist in Rubrivivax gelatinosus and are proposed to be conserved in all facultative aerobic phototrophs: an anaerobic mechanism active under photosynthesis or low oxygenation, and an aerobic mechanism active only under high oxygenation conditions. This was confirmed by analyzing the bacteriochlorophyll accumulation in the wild type and in three mutant strains grown under low or high aeration. A mutant lacking the acsF gene is photosynthetic, exhibits normal bacteriochlorophyll accumulation under low oxygenation and anaerobiosis, and accumulates MgPMe under high oxygenation. The photosynthesis-deficient bchE mutant produces bacteriochlorophyll only under high oxygenation and accumulates MgPMe under low oxygenation and anaerobiosis. The double knockout mutant is devoid of photosystem and accumulates MgPMe under both conditions indicating the involvement of the two enzymes at the same step of the biosynthesis pathway. Oxygen-mediated expression of bchE was studied in the wild type and in a regulatory mutant. The reverse transcriptase-PCR and the bchE promoter activity results demonstrate that the expression of the bchE gene is oxygen-independent and suggest that it is rather the enzyme activity that should be oxygen-sensitive. No obvious sequence similarities were found between oxygen-dependent AcsF and the oxygen-independent anaerobic Mg-protoporphyrin monomethylester cyclase (BchE) enzymes. However, common to all BchE proteins is the conserved CXXX-CXXC sequence. This motif is essential for 4Fe-4S cluster formation in many anaerobic enzymes. Expression and purification of BchE were achieved, and the UV-visible spectral analyses confirmed the presence of an active 4Fe-4S cluster in this protein. The use of different classes of enzymes catalyzing the same reaction under different oxygen growth conditions appears to be a common feature of different biosynthetic pathways, and the benefit of possessing both aerobic and anaerobic systems is discussed.

Purple bacteria perform anoxygenic photosynthesis on the basis of a bacteriochlorophyll-mediated process. It takes place within the membrane photosynthetic apparatus, composed of three pigment-protein complexes as follows: the two light-harvesting antennae and the reaction center, associated with carotenoids and bacteriochlorophylls. Bacteriochlorophyll a is the most widely distributed bacteriochlorin pigment and is found in most photosynthetic bacteria. The early steps in bacteriochlorophyll a biosynthesis up to chlorophyllide a are common to the biosynthesis pathway of chlorophyll a, a pigment present in all organisms capable of oxygenic photosynthesis. The chelation of Mg2+ into protoporphyrin IX to form Mg-protoporphyrin IX (MgP) 1The abbreviations used are: MgP, Mg-protoporphyrin IX; MgPMe, Mg-protoporphyrin monomethyl ester; RT, reverse transcriptase; Km, kanamycin; WT, wild type; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; SAM, S-adenosyl-l-methionine; Pchlide, protochlorophyllide; BchE, anaerobic Mg-protoporphyrin monomethylester cyclase. 1The abbreviations used are: MgP, Mg-protoporphyrin IX; MgPMe, Mg-protoporphyrin monomethyl ester; RT, reverse transcriptase; Km, kanamycin; WT, wild type; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; SAM, S-adenosyl-l-methionine; Pchlide, protochlorophyllide; BchE, anaerobic Mg-protoporphyrin monomethylester cyclase. is catalyzed by the products of the bchD, bchI, and bchH genes. Methylation of MgP to form MgP monomethyl ester (MgPMe) is then catalyzed by the product of bchM (for review see Refs. 1Suzuki J.Y. Bollivar D.W. Bauer C.E. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1997; 31: 61-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar and 2Beale S.I. Photosynth. Res. 1999; 60: 43-79Crossref Scopus (370) Google Scholar). MgPMe, a key intermediate in the biosynthesis of chlorophylls and bacteriochlorophylls, is the substrate for the oxidative cyclase(s) responsible for the formation of the isocyclic ring V of protochlorophyllide (Pchlide) a (1Suzuki J.Y. Bollivar D.W. Bauer C.E. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1997; 31: 61-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 2Beale S.I. Photosynth. Res. 1999; 60: 43-79Crossref Scopus (370) Google Scholar). In phototrophic bacteria, this cyclase is encoded by the bchE gene. Recently, mutational analyses of selected loci from the photosynthesis gene cluster of the purple nonsulfur bacterium Rubrivivax gelatinosus allowed us to identify the acsF gene as responsible for the cyclization of MgPMe (3Pinta V. Picaud M. Reiss-Husson F. Astier C. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 746-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Pinta et al. (3Pinta V. Picaud M. Reiss-Husson F. Astier C. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 746-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) generated a photosynthetic competent mutant accumulating a pigment identified as MgPMe only under high oxygenation. The data showed that under high oxygenation, bacteriochlorophyll a biosynthesis is controlled by AcsF at the level of MgPMe oxidative cyclization and raised the question as to how bacteriochlorophyll a is synthesized under low oxygenation or anaerobic photosynthetic conditions. We have suggested the coexistence of two pathways leading to the bacteriochlorophyll a biosynthesis in this bacterium. This assumption is in agreement with biochemical studies in Rhodovulum sulfidophilum claiming that this bacterium incorporates atomic oxygen from either H2O or O2 to form the 13(1)-oxo group of the bacteriochlorophyll a isocyclic ring, and suggesting that two different cyclization mechanisms coexist in R. sulfidophilum involving both an oxygenase and a hydratase to form the 13(1)-oxo group of the bacteriochlorophyll a isocyclic ring (4Porra R.J. Urzinger M. Winkler J. Bubenzer C. Scheer H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 257: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, in Rhodobacter sphaeroides cells shifted from respiratory to photosynthetic growth conditions, H2O was shown to be the source of oxygen for the cyclization reaction (5Porra R.J. Schafer W. Katheder I. Scheer H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 371: 21-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The derivation of the 13(1)-oxo group from water showed that the formation of the isocyclic ring from the 13-propionic acid methyl ester side chain of MgPMe is an anaerobic process involving a hydratase. This bacterium produces bacteriochlorophyll a also under aerobic conditions, and a homologue of acsF (ORF277) was identified within its photosynthesis gene cluster. The ability to produce bacteriochlorophyll a both aerobically and anaerobically represents a significant advantage for these bacteria as they become competent to produce the photosystem even under aerobiosis and to shift rapidly to photosynthetic growth following reduction of oxygen tension and exposure to light. To elucidate the mechanisms of the bacteriochlorophyll isocyclic ring formation in the photosynthetic bacterium R. gelatinosus, we have identified the bchE gene and analyzed bchE and acsF knockout mutants. The observed phenotypes and the characteristics of the bacteriochlorophyll precursors in the mutants strongly support the involvement of the two genes at the same level of the biosynthetic pathway and explain the presence of bacteriochlorophyll a either under aerobiosis or anaerobiosis in R. gelatinosus and in other facultative aerobic photosynthetic bacteria.

Plasmid DNAs were purified using QIAprep spin miniprep kit (Qiagen) or Quantum prep plasmid midiprep kit (Bio-Rad). DNA was treated with restriction enzymes and other nucleic acid-modifying enzymes (Klenow fragment, T4 DNA polymerase, and T4 DNA ligase) according to the manufacturer's specifications. DNA fragments were analyzed on agarose gels, and different restriction fragments were purified using the Geneclean kit (Bio 101, Inc., Vista, CA). Library Screening for bchE—The PCR was carried out using genomic or plasmid templates in a 50-μl reaction mixture containing PCR buffer, 1.5 μm MgCl2, 200 μm of each deoxynucleoside triphosphate, 1 μm of each primer, 5% Me2SO, and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase. 20 cycles were performed in a Hybaid thermal cycler, each cycle comprising 30 s at 92 °C, 40 s at 60 °C, and 60 s at 72 °C.

Picaud M. Reiss-Husson F. Vernotte C. Astier C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 379-385PubMed Google Scholar). Transformants were selected on malate plates supplemented with the appropriate antibiotic. Construction of the bchE-lacZ Reporter Fusion Plasmid—To construct a bchE-lacZ fusion, the promoter region of bchE containing the putative PpsR-binding site (TGTN12ACA) was amplified by PCR (380-bp DNA fragment) from plasmid pSO2770. The following primers were designed to create XbaI and BamHI sites at 5′ and 3′ ends of the amplified fragment, respectively: Ol-bchE-FBamHI and Ol-bchE-RXbaI. The sequence and the orientation of the amplified DNA fragment were confirmed by sequencing after cloning into the BamHI and XbaI site of the lacZ transcriptional fusion vector plasmid pSO3001 to generate the fusion plasmid pSO3027 (bchE::lacZ). RT-PCR Analysis of bchE Gene Expression—Total RNA from WT cells grown photosynthetically or aerobically under high or low oxygenation was extracted according to Ref. 10Heck C. Rothfuchs R. Jager A. Rauhut R. Klug G. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 1165-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, treated with RNase-free DNase I, and then purified by phenol chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. A reverse transcription reaction was performed to synthesize the cDNA from 3 μg of total RNA using Superscript II RNase enzyme (Invitrogen) at 60 °C for 1 h with oligonucleotide Ol-bchE-R2 (extending from position +1110 to +1091 of the bchE gene). The products were then amplified by PCR and analyzed by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels. Primers corresponding to the coding region of bchE gene were Ol-bchE-R2 and Ol-bchE-F (extending from position +726 to +748 of the bchE gene) and were designed to obtain a 384-bp-long PCR product. For each RT-PCR experiment, a control experiment (RNA template without the reverse transcriptase) was performed to check that there was no trace of genomic DNA. Construction of Plasmids for High Level Expression of BchE in E. coli—A His6-tagged construct was prepared using the pET-15b plasmid (Novagen). The bchE gene was amplified by PCR from pSO2770 plasmid using the Ol-HbchE-FNdeI and Ol-HbchE-RBamHI primers. NdeI and BamHI sites were introduced at the ATG translation initiation codon and after the TGA stop codon, respectively. The NdeI-BamHI PCR fragment was inserted into the NdeI-BamHI site of pET-15b. Two plasmids were isolated and sequenced. Plasmid pSO2775 contains the wild type sequence of bchE and should encode a full-length protein. In plasmid pSO2776, a spontaneous mutation (G to A) was randomly introduced during PCR, introducing a premature stop codon at position 1098 (TGA/TGG) of the bchE coding sequence. Overexpression, Purification, and Analysis of a His-tagged BchE Protein—E. coli BL21(DE3) cells harboring either pSO2775 or pSO2776 were grown in LB medium at 30 °C until they had reached an A600 of 0.6. Then isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and growth was continued for 4 h. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside-induced cells from 200-ml cultures were suspended in 50 ml of binding buffer containing 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.9), 5 mm imidazole, and 0.5 m NaCl and broken by a French pressure cell. Unbroken cells and debris were removed by centrifugation at 600 × g for 10 min. Inclusion bodies were obtained by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 10 min. The expressed proteins were extracted from the inclusion bodies using 6 m urea in the binding buffer. To purify the proteins, the supernatants were applied to nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) affinity columns equilibrated with binding buffer. The columns were then washed with this buffer and the wash buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.9), 0.5 m NaCl, and 15 mm imidazole). The bound proteins were eluted from the columns with elution buffer containing 500 mm imidazole. The overexpressed His-tagged BchE proteins were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue. Membrane Protein Preparation and Spectrophotometric Measurements—The membranes were prepared by cell disruption with a French press in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, followed by differential ultracentrifugation. The membranes were then resuspended in the same buffer. Absorption spectroscopy was performed with a CARY 500 spectrophotometer. Preparation of Pigment Extracts—Cells were harvested in their exponential growth phase, when the culture optical density at 680 nm reached 0.7. Pigments were extracted from cell pellets by resuspending cells in 20 volumes of ice-cold acetone/methanol 7:2 (v/v). The cell debris was eliminated by centrifugation. Further extractions were made until the cell debris pellet was completely depigmented. For the HPLC analyses, the solvent and residual water were then totally evaporated. The dried pigments were resolubilized in a small volume of acetone/methanol 7:2 (v/v) and concentrated by evaporation. Secreted pigments were extracted from 10 ml of growth medium using Sep-Pak C18 silica cartridges (Waters) according to the manufacturer's specifications. The pigments were eluted by adding 1 ml of ice-cold acetone/methanol 7:2 (v/v). HPLC Analysis—20 μl of pigment preparation were injected on a 5-μm Kromasil C18 column (4.6 mm inner diameter, length 250 mm) and eluted at a 1 ml/min solvent flow rate. HPLC solvent mixture was acetonitrile/methanol/dichloromethane 75:15:15 (v/v/v). Detection was carried out at 436 nm, and collected fractions were further analyzed by spectrophotometric absorption measurements. Sequencing of the entire photosynthesis gene cluster of R. gelatinosus followed by mutational analysis allowed the identification of the acsF gene as responsible for the aerobic oxidative cyclization of MgPMe (3Pinta V. Picaud M. Reiss-Husson F. Astier C. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 746-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In Rhodobacter species, this reaction is catalyzed under anaerobiosis by the BchE Mg-protoporphyrin IX monomethyl ester oxidative cyclase (11Yang Z.M. Bauer C.E. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5001-5010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To elucidate the mechanism of the bacteriochlorophyll isocyclic ring formation in R. gelatinosus under anaerobiosis conditions, we have undertaken the study of bchE involvement in this process. Cloning and Sequence Analysis of the bchE Genomic Region in R. gelatinosus—The purple photosynthetic bacterium R. gelatinosus has within its genome a cluster of ∼59 kb in length containing most of the photosynthesis related genes (12Igarashi N. Harada J. Nagashima S. Matsuura K. Shimada K. Nagashima K.V. J. Mol. Evol. 2001; 52: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Two genes involved in bacteriochlorophyll biosynthesis are missing from this cluster. In an attempt to identify these genes, namely bchE and bchJ involved in the early stage of bacteriochlorophyll biosynthesis, a R. gelatinosus genomic DNA library was screened using a couple of primers (Ol-bchE-F and Ol-bchE-R) based on the published Rhodobacter bchE gene sequences (AJ010302 and Z11165). A plasmid (pSO2770) containing bchE and bchJ genes was isolated and sequenced. Sequence similarity searches were performed using the BLAST network service (13Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (58771) Google Scholar). The bchE gene is 1746 bp long and encodes a 582-amino acid polypeptide with a predicted molecular mass of about 63 kDa. A putative PpsR-binding motif was identified upstream from the bchE gene suggesting an oxygen-dependent expression of bchE. BlastP and Clustal analyses indicated that the BchE polypeptide from R. gelatinosus shows similarities to BchE from R. rubrum (68% identity and 80% similarity) and from R. sphaeroides (61% identity and 74% similarity). Further sequence analyses indicate that BchE possesses a vitamin B12-binding motif in its N-terminal domain suggesting that this protein uses vitamin B12 as cofactor. A potential S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM)-binding motif characteristic of methyltransferases is present in the central region. Moreover, cysteine residues Cys-205, Cys-209, and Cys-212, which are part of a conserved CXXXCXXC motif, were found in many BchE proteins. This motif was also found and shown to be essential for a 4Fe-4S cluster formation in many oxygen-independent oxidases. bchE Mutant Construction and Characterization—To gain insight into the role of bchE gene in the bacteriochlorophyll isocyclic ring formation, a bchE mutant was generated. For that purpose the bchE gene fragment cloned in plasmid pSO2771 was disrupted with the kanamycin resistance cartridge inserted at the BssHII site of bchE to construct plasmid pSO2772. Wild type cells electroporated with pSO2772 were plated on selective medium under respiratory conditions to select transformants resulting from double crossover events. The BCHE mutant colonies showed a brown pigmentation on plates. The BCHE mutant was photosynthesis-deficient, and interestingly, when grown aerobically under high oxygenation, the mutant resembles wild type, i.e. it synthesizes bacteriochlorophyll and assembles the photosystem like a photosynthetic competent strain. Furthermore, the culture medium was pigmented (greenish) only when cells were grown under low oxygenation conditions, suggesting the presence of a pigment secreted by the cells and indicating that they have an altered pigment production. The involvement of bchE in the MgPMe-cyclase reaction was first investigated by absorption spectroscopy. Because the BCHE mutant is photosynthetic deficient, the growth properties of this mutant and its ability to synthesize pigments and photosystem were investigated, in comparison to the WT grown under respiratory conditions, under high or low oxygenation. Under high oxygenation conditions, both strains had the same generation time and assembled photosynthetic complexes as indicated by the absorbance peaks at 800 and 860 nm (Fig. 1A). Nevertheless, under low oxygenation conditions, and unlike the WT, the BCHE mutant assembled no or a very low amount of photosynthetic complexes (Fig. 1B). Moreover, this strain also accumulated an additional compound absorbing at 416 nm characteristic of protochlorophyllide in aqueous solution. Analysis of acetone/methanol pigment extracts from WT and BCHE strains grown under high oxygenation conditions showed identical spectra, with absorption at 770 nm for bacteriochlorophyll a, 420-442-472 nm for carotenoids, and 362 nm for the bacteriochlorophyll a Soret absorption band (Fig. 2A). Under low oxygenation, the WT spectrum still presented the same characteristics. In contrast, only traces of bacteriochlorophyll a could be detected in the low oxygenated BCHE mutant, whereas a majority peak appeared at 416 nm (Fig. 2B). These spectral characteristics of the BCHE mutant grown under low oxygenation recall the spectral characteristics of the SIX9Km (acsF::Km) mutant grown under high oxygenation (3Pinta V. Picaud M. Reiss-Husson F. Astier C. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 746-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Functional Complementation of BCHE Phenotype— pSO2773, a replicative plasmid bearing the bchE gene, was introduced into BCHE mutant cells. All the resulting colonies were photosynthetic, produced bacteriochlorophyll a, and assembled spectral complexes under photosynthetic as well as under low oxygenation conditions. These experiments confirmed that the loss of bacteriochlorophyll a and photosystem in the BCHE mutant grown under low oxygenation was strictly due to the disruption of the bchE gene. HPLC Analysis of Pigments from High and Low Oxygenated bchE Mutant Cells—Even though the above data suggest that the BCHE mutant accumulates the MgPMe intermediate of bacteriochlorophyll biosynthesis, like the (acsF::Km) mutant, further analysis of the bacteriochlorophyll intermediates pool accumulated by the bchE disrupted mutant was subsequently undertaken to determine the nature of these pigments. For this analysis, the pigment content of the BCHE mutant grown under either low or high oxygenation was analyzed by HPLC. Isolated pigment fractions were identified on the basis of their UV-visible absorption spectra and of the retention time. In the isolated pigment extract from cells grown under high oxygenation, two fractions were collected (peak 1 and 4) in addition to the carotenoid OH spheroidenone (peak 3) (Fig. 3A). According to their retention time and UV-visible absorption spectra, fraction 1 was identified as Mg-protoporphyrin (416-552-590 nm), whereas fraction 4 was identified as bacteriochlorophyll a (770 nm). In the extracted pigment from cells grown under low oxygenation, three fractions were collected and analyzed by UV-visible absorbance (Fig. 3B). Fraction 1 elutes after 2.6 min and was identified as Mg-protoporphyrin (MgP) (416-552-590 nm) or its monomethyl ester (MgPMe). Based on the data published previously (3Pinta V. Picaud M. Reiss-Husson F. Astier C. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 746-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) concerning the retention time of MgPMe and MgP, this compound is proposed to be the MgPMe. Fraction 2 elutes after 4 min and absorbs at 402-504-538-574 and 680 nm, it was identified as protoporphyrin IX. Fraction 4 corresponds to the smallest peak; it elutes after 11 min and exhibits a maximal peak at 770 nm; it was concluded that it corresponds to bacteriochlorophyll a. These results showed that the main accumulated metalloporphyrins in the BCHE mutant grown under low oxygenation are similar to those found in the R. gelatinosus acsF mutant grown under high oxygenation. This is the first direct evidence that both enzymes are involved in MgPMe cyclization and catalyze the same step of bacteriochlorophyll biosynthesis. Nevertheless, AcsF acts strictly under high oxygenation conditions, whereas BchE is involved when the oxygen tension drops. If this assumption is correct, then a double bchE-acsF mutant should be devoid of bacteriochlorophyll a and photosystem irrespective of growth conditions. bchE-acsF Double Mutant Construction and Characterization—To inactivate the acsF gene in the WT and in the BCHE backgrounds, a plasmid (pSO2774) bearing the acsF gene with the Ω cartridge inserted at the StuI site was used to electroporate the WT and the BCHE cells. Electroporated cells were plated on selective medium to select transformants resulting from double crossover events. The resulting disrupted strains were named ACSFΩ and BCHE-ACSF, respectively. ACSFΩ mutant has almost the same phenotype as SIX9Km (3Pinta V. Picaud M. Reiss-Husson F. Astier C. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 746-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).

We report that treatment of human T lymphocytes with a recombinant membrane-permeable YopH resulted in severe reduction in intracellular tyrosine phosphorylation and inhibition of T cell activation. The primary signal transducer for the T cell antigen receptor, the Lck tyrosine kinase, was specifically precipitated by a substrate-trapping YopH mutant, and Lck was dephosphorylated at its positive regulatory site, Tyr-394, in cells containing active YopH. By turning off Lck, YopH blocks T cell antigen receptor signaling at its very first step, effectively preventing the development of a protective immune response against this lethal bacterium."

It has been demonstrated that the transfer of GlcNAc to the 2-OH position of the mannose residue is catalyzed by the enzyme, protein O-mannose β1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (POMGnT1), but the enzymatic basis of the transfer to the 6-OH position is unknown. We recently reported on a brain-specific β1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, GnT-IX, that catalyzes the transfer of GlcNAc to the 6-OH position of the mannose residue of GlcNAcβ1,2-Manα on both the α1,3- and α1,6-linked mannose arms in the core structure of N-glycan (Inamori, K., Endo, T., Ide, Y., Fujii, S., Gu, J., Honke, K., and Taniguchi, N.

Using three synthetic Ser-linked mannose-containing saccharides, Manα1-Ser, GlcNAcβ1,2-Manα1-Ser, and Galβ1,4-GlcNAcβ1,2-Manα1-Ser as acceptor substrates, the findings show that 14C-labeled GlcNAc was incorporated only into GlcNAcβ1,2-Manα1-Ser after separation by thin layer chromatography. To simplify the assay, high performance liquid chromatography was employed, using a fluorescence-labeled acceptor substrate GlcNAcβ1,2-Manα1-Ser-pyridylaminoethylsuccinamyl (PAES). Consistent with the above data, GnT-IX generated a new product which was identified as GlcNAcβ1,2-(GlcNAcβ1,6-)Manα1-Ser-PAES by mass spectrometry and 1H NMR. Furthermore, incorporation of an additional GlcNAc residue into a synthetic mannosyl peptide Ac-Ala-Ala-Pro-Thr(Man)-Pro-Val-Ala-Ala-Pro-NH2 by GnT-IX was only observed in the presence of POMGnT1.

Nearly all secreted and cell surface proteins in mammalian cells are glycosylated, and two major groups on glycoproteins are N- and O-glycans. In O-glycans, the mucin-type O-GalNAc linkage and O-xylose linkage in proteoglycans are well known. In addition to these O-glycans, several other unique linkages such as O-linked fucose (1.Nishimura H. Takao T. Hase S. Shimonishi Y. Iwanaga S. J. Biol.

One of the obvious functional roles of O-mannosylation has been shown to involve a sialyl O-mannosyl glycan, Siaα2,3-Galβ1,4-GlcNAcβ1,2-Man, is the laminin binding ligand of α-dystroglycan (8.Chiba A.

MEB is congenital muscular dystrophy caused by a defect in the binding activity of dystroglycan to its ligands, including laminin, neurexin, and agrin due to the hypoglycosylation of α-dystroglycan (11.Michele D.E.

Interestingly, O-mannosyl glycan is one of major O-glycans in the brain (its ratio to the O-linked GalNAc is about 1:3), which contains GlcNAcβ1,2-Man and GlcNAcβ1,2-(GlcNAcβ1,6-)Man structures (12.Chai W.

In addition, the brain contains the HNK-1 epitope (sulfoglucuronyl lactosamine) carried on O-mannosyl glycans that contain 2-mono- and 2,6-di-substituted mannose (13.Yuen C.T. Chai W. Loveless R.W.

To date, it has been demonstrated that the GlcNAcβ1,2-Man linkage is formed by the action of POMGnT1, but the enzymatic basis of the formation of the GlcNAcβ1,6-Man linkage in O-mannosyl glycan remains unclear. We recently identified a new β1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, GnT-IX, as a homolog of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V (GnT-V), which is specifically expressed in the brain (14.Inamori K. Endo T. Ide Y. Fujii S. Gu J. Honke K. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43102-43109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). GnT-IX was found to catalyze the transfer of GlcNAc to the 6-OH position of the mannose in the sequence of GlcNAcβ1,2-Manα, present in both the α1,3- and α1,6-linked mannose arms in the core structure of N-glycan. In the present study, we provide evidence to show that GnT-IX also catalyzes the transfer of GlcNAc in β1,6-linkage to O-mannosyl glycan, indicating that GnT-IX is responsible for the formation of the 2,6-branched structure of O-mannosyl glycans in the brain. Materials—Ser-linked mannose-containing saccharides, Manα1-O-Ser, GlcNAcβ1,2-Manα1-O-Ser, and Galβ1,4-GlcNAcβ1,2-Manα1-O-Ser were synthesized as reported previously (15.Seifert J. Ogawa T. Kurono S. Ito Y. Glycoconj. J. 2000; 17: 407-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). GlcNAcβ1,2-Manα1-O-Ser was fluorescence-labeled with N-[2-(2-pyridylamino)ethyl]succinamic acid 5-norbornene-2,3-dicarboxyimide ester (Wako, Osaka, Japan) and the labeled substrate (GnM-S-PAES) was purified by TSKgel Amide-80 column (21.5 × 300 mm; Tosoh) and TSKgel ODS-80TM column (7.8 × 300 mm; Tosoh) using a Shimadzu LC-VP HPLC system. The labeled substrate was eluted with a linear gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid from an amide column and with 20 mm ammonium acetate (pH 4.0) from an ODS column and monitored with a fluorescence spectrophotometer (excitation, 320 nm; emission, 400 nm). The synthetic mannosyl peptide (Ac-Ala-Ala-Pro-Thr(Man)-Pro-Val-Ala-Ala-Pro-NH2) was kindly provided by Dr. Toshiyuki Inazu (Department of Applied Chemistry, School of Engineering, Tokai University). Recombinant soluble GnT-IX was prepared as described previously (14.Inamori K. Endo T. Ide Y. Fujii S. Gu J. Honke K. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43102-43109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Activity Assay for GnT-IX—The activity assay using the synthetic Ser-linked mannose-containing saccharides as acceptor substrates was performed in a mixture of 0.1 m MOPS (pH 7.5), 10 mm EDTA, 21.9 μm UDP-[14C]GlcNAc (71.2 Ci/mol), 0.5 mm substrate and recombinant soluble GnT-IX in a volume of 20 μl. After incubation for 12 h at 37 °C, the reaction mixture was boiled for 3 min, diluted with 80 μl of water, and then passed through an AG-X8 column (Bio-Rad, acetate form, 0.1 ml). The flow-through was evaporated and redissolved in 10 μl of water and then applied to a Silica gel 60 HPTLC plate (Merck). The plate was developed with methanol:n-butyl alcohol:acetic acid:water (2:2:1:1 by volume), and the incorporation of the radioactivity was visualized by a phosphorimager (BAS-2500, Fuji Film, Tokyo). The reaction using a synthetic mannosyl peptide, Ac-Ala-Ala-Pro-Thr(Man)-Pro-Val-Ala-Ala-Pro-NH2, was performed in a mixture of 0.1 m MOPS (pH 7.5), 10 mm MnCl2,40mm UDP-GlcNAc, 200 mm GlcNAc, 0.5% Triton X-100, 40 μm mannosyl peptide, with or without recombinant soluble GnT-IX and partially purified recombinant POMGnT1. The enzymatic product was separated by HPLC. MALDI-TOF MS Analysis—MALDI-TOF MS was performed with a Perseptive Biosystems Voyager RP-DE instrument. The mass spectra were acquired in the reflectron mode under a 20 kV accelerating voltage with positive detection. 2,5-Dihydroxybenzoic acid (10 mg/ml) was used as the matrix. NMR Analysis—For preparation of the NMR sample, a large scale reaction was carried out in a mixture of 0.1 m MOPS (pH 7.5), 10 mm EDTA, 40 mm UDP-GlcNAc, 100 mm GlcNAc, 0.5 m glycine, 0.5 mm GnM-S-PAES, and recombinant soluble GnT-IX. After 36 h of incubation at 37 °C, the reaction product was isolated using a TSKgel ODS-80TM column (7.8 × 300 mm, Tosoh) as described previously (14.Inamori K. Endo T. Ide Y. Fujii S. Gu J. Honke K.

The separated sugar chains were lyophilized, dissolved in 99.9% D2O, and then lyophilized from D2O twice and dissolved in this solvent. Proton NMR measurements were carried out on a Varian Unity-400 spectrometer at 400 MHz at 30 °C. Chemical shifts are expressed as parts per million (ppm) relative to an external standard of 3-(trimethylsilyl)propionic acid-d4.

Three synthetic Ser-linked mannose-containing saccharides, Manα1-O-Ser, GlcNAcβ1,2-Manα1-O-Ser, and Galβ1,4-GlcNAcβ1,2-Manα1-O-Ser, were separately incubated with recombinant soluble GnT-IX and UDP-[14C]GlcNAc. After incubation, unreacted UDP-[14C]GlcNAc was removed by anion-exchange column chromatography and the reaction product was separated on HPTLC. Interestingly, radioactivity was incorporated only when GlcNAcβ1,2-Manα1-O-Ser was used as an acceptor (Fig. 1A). When POMGnT1 and GnT-IX were simultaneously incubated with a synthetic mannosyl peptide, Ac-Ala-Ala-Pro-Thr(Man)-Pro-Val-Ala-Ala-Pro-NH2, two GlcNAc residues were incorporated into the substrate (m/z values for (M + Na)+ of 1425.6 and (M + K)+ of 1441.5), but no transfer was detected by GnT-IX in the absence of POMGnT1 (data not shown), as confirmed by HPLC and MS analysis (Fig. 2C) of the enzymatic product. It supports the view that GnT-IX acts on the GlcNAcβ1,2-Manα structure in O-mannosyl glycans of glycoproteins as a substrate, and the action is dependent on prior action of POMGnT1. This substrate specificity is similar to that of the homolog, GnT-V, which is not able to catalyze the transfer of GlcNAc to the galactosylated biantennary sugar chains, as reported previously (16.Gu J.

The fluorescence-labeled substrate GnM-S-PAES was incubated in the reaction mixture, and the enzymatic product was then separated from the substrate on an ODS column. The product peak (P) had a faster retention time than the substrate peak (S) as shown in Fig. 1B. The separated product peak and the substrate were subjected to MS analysis (Fig. 2A). The spectrum of the substrate showed an m/z value for (M + H)+ of 690.9, corresponding to that of the calculated value of GnM-S-PAES (691.7). On the other hand, the spectrum of the product peak showed an m/z value for (M + H)+ of 894.6, indicating that one GlcNAc had been transferred to the substrate. NMR analyses were carried out to further confirm the structure of the enzymatic product. Proton NMR spectra of the substrate and the product are shown in Fig. 2B. In the spectrum of the substrate, anomeric proton signals of Man and GlcNAc were observed at 4.838 and 4.546 ppm, respectively, and a methyl proton signal corresponding to the acetyl group of GlcNAc was detected at 2.057 ppm. The anomeric proton signal of GlcNAc appeared as a doublet with a coupling constant of 8.2 Hz. In the spectrum of the product, a methyl proton signal of an additional GlcNAc appeared at 2.038 ppm. The chemical shift value was similar to that of the methyl proton signal of GlcNAc, which was linked to the 6-OH position of Man 4 in the tetra'-antennary sugar chain (14.Inamori K. Endo T. Ide Y. Fujii S. Gu J. Honke K. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43102-43109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). A new anomeric proton signal consistent with the GlcNAc was found at 4.594 ppm as a doublet with a coupling constant of 8.0 Hz. The coupling constant value indicates that the linkage of the GlcNAc is β. The anomeric proton signal of Man was observed at 4.797 ppm and showed a shift to higher field by 0.041 ppm relative to that of the substrate (spectra of S and P in Fig. 2B). A similar up-field shift of the Man anomeric proton signal was observed when GlcNAc was attached to 6-OH position of Man (14.Inamori K. Endo T. Ide Y. Fujii S. Gu J. Honke K. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43102-43109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the additional GlcNAc of the product is linked to the 6-OH position of Man and that the anomeric configuration is β. To determine whether GnT-V also catalyzes the same reaction, recombinant GnT-V, possessing equivalent enzymatic activity toward the GnGn-bi-PA substrate with GnT-IX, was incubated with GnM-S-PAES, but no activity was detected (data not shown). As a result, we conclude that GnT-IX, but not GnT-V, acts on the GlcNAcβ1,2-Manα structure in the O-mannosyl glycan, as a β1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase. Fig. 3 shows a proposed biosynthetic pathway for the brain O-mannosyl glycan mediated by POMGnT1 and GnT-IX. It has been suggested that a putative O-mannosyltransferase, POMT1, catalyzes the addition of mannose to OH groups of Ser and Thr residues of polypeptides (17.Beltran-Valero de Bernabe D. Currier S.

In conclusion, our results indicate that GnT-IX is a novel β1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase that acts not only on N-glycans but on O-mannosyl glycans as well. Although the biological function of the 2,6-branched structure remains unclear, the addition of GlcNAc to the 6-OH position of O-mannosyl glycan may contribute to an increase in terminal glycan structures which, in turn, may modify the affinities and avidities with respect to interacting counterparts.

https://openalex.org/W2021707184,"Agrin activates the transmembrane tyrosine kinase MuSK to mediate acetylcholine receptor (AChR) clustering at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). However, the intracellular signaling mechanism downstream of MuSK is poorly characterized. This study provides evidence that geranylgeranyltransferase I (GGT) is an important signaling component in the Agrin/MuSK pathway. Agrin causes a rapid increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of the alpha(G/F) subunit of GGT and in GGT activity. Inhibition of GGT activity or expression prevents muscle cells from forming AChR clusters in response to Agrin and attenuates the formation of neuromuscular synapses in spinal neuron-muscle cocultures. Importantly, transgenic mice expressing an alpha(G/F) mutant demonstrate NMJ defects with wider endplate bands and smaller AChR plaques. These results support the notion that prenylation is necessary for AChR clustering and the NMJ formation and/or maintenance, revealing an active role of GGT in Agrin/MuSK signaling."

System A amino acid transport activity is sodium-dependent, pH-sensitive, inhibited by high concentrations of intracellular amino acids, and displays a preference for neutral amino acids with unbranched side chains. There are a number of recent reviews that have summarized the current understanding of amino acid transport mechanisms and transporter regulation (1Bode B.P. J. Nutr. 2001; 131: 2475S-2485SGoogle Scholar, 2Broer S. Pflugers Arch. 2002; 444: 457-466Google Scholar, 3Brosnan J.T. J. Nutr. 2003; 133: 2068S-2072SGoogle Scholar, 4Hyde R. Taylor P.M. Hundal H.S. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 1-18Google Scholar). System A can be the rate-determining step for hepatic alanine utilization and may also contribute to whole body nitrogen homeostasis as a mediator of glutamine transport (1Bode B.P. J. Nutr. 2001; 131: 2475S-2485SGoogle Scholar, 2Broer S. Pflugers Arch. 2002; 444: 457-466Google Scholar). The activity is linked to the cell cycle and cell growth rate as illustrated by the observation that the transformed cells exhibit subsequently elevated system A uptake relative to parental cells or tissues (5Saier Jr., M.H. Daniels G.A. Boerner P. Lin J. J. Membr. Biol. 1988; 104: 1-20Google Scholar). System A transport activity is up-regulated in mammalian cells in response to amino acid deprivation (6Gazzola G.C.

J. 1972; 128: 19-27Google Scholar), but until recently, little progress was made toward understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying this increase because of the lack of molecular tools. Indirect evidence suggested that the gene encoding System A is regulated at the level of transcription (8Tarnuzzer R.W. Campa M.J. Qian N.-X. Englesberg E. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13914-13917Google Scholar).During the past several years cDNA sequences for three System A-encoding isoforms have been cloned (9Varoqui H. Zhu H. Yao D. Ming H. Erickson J.D. J.

Pflugers Arch. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that human SNAT2 is the primary isoform induced by amino acid deprivation and there is a direct relationship between SNAT2 mRNA expression and System A transport activity (15Gazzola R.F. Sala R. Bussolati O. Visigalli R. Dall'Asta V. Ganapathy V. Gazzola G.C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 490: 11-14Google Scholar, 16Ling R. Bridges C.C. Sugawara M. Fujita T. Leibach F.H. Prasad P.D. Ganapathy V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1512: 15-21Google Scholar). Extending those studies, we recently documented amino acid-regulated transcription from a human SNAT2 genomic fragment (17Bain P.J. LeBlanc-Chaffin R. Chen H. Palii S.S. Leach K.M. Kilberg M.S. J. Nutr. 2002; 132: 3023-3029Google Scholar). A decline in cellular amino acid content results in enhanced translation of specific mRNA species (18Jefferson L.S. Kimball S.R. J. Nutr. 2001; 131: 2460S-2466SGoogle Scholar) and elevated transcription of selected genes. A number of examples of this increased transcription have been reported for genes encoding enzymes, transporters, and ribosomal proteins (19Fafournoux P. Bruhat A. Jousse C. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 1-12Google Scholar, 20Kilberg M.S. Barbosa-Tessmann I.P. J. Nutr. 2002; 132: 1801-1804Google Scholar). One example is the human asparagine synthetase gene for which transcription increases in response to either amino acid deprivation or endoplasmic reticulum stress (21Gong S.S. Guerrini L. Basilico C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6059-6066Google Scholar, 22Barbosa-Tessmann I.P. Pineda V.L. Nick H.S. Schuster S.M. Kilberg M.S. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 151-158Google Scholar, 23Barbosa-Tessmann I.P.

It has been demonstrated that nutrient sensing response element-1 and -2 (NSRE-1 and NSRE-2), 1The abbreviations used are: NSREnutrient sensing response elementSNAT2sodium-coupled neutral amino acid transporter-2CHOPC/EBP homology proteinntnucleotide(s)AAREamino acid response elementMEMminimal essential mediumC/EBPCCAAT/enhancer-binding protein.1The abbreviations used are: NSREnutrient sensing response elementSNAT2sodium-coupled neutral amino acid transporter-2CHOPC/EBP homology proteinntnucleotide(s)AAREamino acid response elementMEMminimal essential mediumC/EBPCCAAT/enhancer-binding protein. located in the asparagine synthetase proximal promoter, mediate both of these responses (24Barbosa-Tessmann I.P. Chen C. Zhong C. Siu F. Schuster S.M. Nick H.S. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26976-26985Google Scholar). The human C/EBP homology protein (CHOP) promoter contains a sequence that differs from the asparagine synthetase NSRE-1 by only two nucleotides (5′-ATGATGCAAT-3′) and functions as an amino acid response element (AARE) (25Bruhat A. Jousse C. Carraro V. Reimold A.M. Ferrara M. Fafournoux P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7192-7204Google Scholar, 26Bruhat A. Averous J. Carraro V. Zhong C. Reimold A.M. Kilberg M.S. Fafournoux P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48107-48114Google Scholar). The CHOP AARE has been termed a C/EBP-ATF composite site, because it binds members from both of these subfamilies of the bZIP superfamily of transcription factors (27Fawcett T.W. Martindale J.L. Guyton K.Z. Hai T. Holbrook N.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 135-141Google Scholar, 28Wolfgang C.D. Chen B.P. Martindale J.L. Holbrook N.J. Hai T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6700-6707Google Scholar).The molecular mechanism for increased SNAT2 mRNA production following amino acid deprivation has been contrasted with that for asparagine synthetase (17Bain P.J. LeBlanc-Chaffin R. Chen H. Palii S.S. Leach K.M. Kilberg M.S. J. Nutr. 2002; 132: 3023-3029Google Scholar), and fundamental differences were observed between the mechanisms for nutrient regulation. For example, when HepG2 hepatoma cells were incubated in amino acid-deprived media, there was a lag period of ∼4 h before an increase in asparagine synthetase mRNA content was detected, whereas the elevation of SNAT2 mRNA was detectable as early as 2 h following amino acid removal. Additionally, de novo protein synthesis was absolutely required for the asparagine synthetase activation, whereas the increase in SNAT2 mRNA content was largely independent of protein synthesis. Based on these observations, it was concluded that it is unlikely that the SNAT2 gene will contain the same genomic nutrient-responsive cis-elements as the asparagine synthetase gene.The purpose of this paper is to report the identification of the SNAT2 AARE, describe its initial characterization, and document its unique localization within the first intron for both the human and the mouse genes. In close proximity to the AARE, there are two highly conserved sequences that contribute to regulated SNAT2 expression. One is a purine-rich (PuR) sequence that serves as a repressor element to maintain the low basal transcription rate, and the second is a CAAT-containing sequence that enhances the action of the AARE. The data also show that the CAAT/AARE combination exhibits enhancer-like activity, conferring regulated transcription to a heterologous promoter and functioning in a location- and orientation-independent manner.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture—Human HepG2 hepatoma cells were cultured in 75-cm2 tissue culture flasks at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air. The medium used was modified Eagle's minimal essential medium (MEM) (Mediatech, Herndon, VA), supplemented with 25 mm NaHCO3, 2 mm glutamine, 10 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, 100 μg/ml penicillin G, 28.4 μg/ml gentamycin, 0.023 μg/ml N-butyl-p-hydroxybenzoate, 0.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, and 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. For amino acid deprivation experiments, the complete MEM was removed and replaced with either fresh complete MEM or MEM lacking histidine, each supplemented with 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum.Northern Analysis—Cells were grown to 60–70% confluence in 60-mm tissue culture dishes, subjected to the amino acid deprivation treatment as described in the figure legends, and then RNA was collected using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). RNA was subjected to Northern analysis as described by Barbosa-Tessmann et al. (22Barbosa-Tessmann I.P. Pineda V.L. Nick H.S. Schuster S.M. Kilberg M.S. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 151-158Google Scholar). The cDNA probes for the human SNAT2 and the ribosomal protein L7a were described previously (17Bain P.J. LeBlanc-Chaffin R. Chen H. Palii S.S. Leach K.M. Kilberg M.S. J. Nutr. 2002; 132: 3023-3029Google Scholar). Radiolabeled cDNA probes were prepared with [32P]dATP (Amersham Biosciences) using a Strip-EZ DNA probe synthesis kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Autoradiographs were made using Kodak Bio-Max MS film and Bio-Max MR intensifier screens (Kodak, Rochester, NY). The relative intensity of each experimental band was determined by densitometry and then normalized to the signal intensity of the L7a control mRNA for which there was little or no change in expression under the experimental conditions.Cloning of Genomic Fragments and Plasmid Construction—Human SNAT2 genomic fragments, corresponding to the region 5′ upstream of the transcription start site, were amplified by PCR from a bacterial artificial chromosome 12 clone (number RP11-474P2 from the BACPAC Resource Center, Oakland, CA). The obtained PCR products were cloned in front of the promoter-less firefly luciferase reporter vector using either the KpnI or BglII sites of the pGL3 plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI). A mouse genomic library (number RPCI 23 from the BACPAC Resource Center) was screened using a DNA probe generated by PCR from mouse genomic DNA using primers based on the published human SNAT2 sequence with the forward primer starting at nt +1418 (in exon 2) and the reverse primer starting at nt +2224 (in exon 4) of the human gene (see Table I). Screening of the mouse genomic library yielded four positive clones, one of which, was used for further analysis. From the original positive, a 1.7-kb BamHI fragment and a 5-kb XbaI fragment, which hybridized to the mouse Snat2 probe, were obtained and then subcloned. Sequencing results showed that the BamHI fragment contained mouse Snat2 sequence from nt -227/+1465, based on a reported transcription start site (GenBank™ accession number AK017145). Likewise, it was shown that the XbaI fragment contained nt -1255/+3700 of the mouse Snat2 gene. Subsequently, smaller fragments were generated by restriction enzyme digestion, and a putative minimal core promoter sequence, nt -227/+1 was generated by PCR using primers (see Table I) that were based on sequencing the BamHI fragment. For the experiments designed to test the transcriptional regulatory properties of these genomic fragments, PCR products were cloned into a firefly luciferase reporter vector (pGL3-control vector) or this same vector containing a 5′ upstream promoter fragment of the human SNAT2 gene (nt -512/+59) to function as a basal, homologous promoter. The fidelity of the clones and their orientation were tested by restriction enzyme digestion and gel electrophoresis, and confirmed by sequencing.Table IPCR primers The primers listed in this table were used for cloning mouse and human SNAT2 genomic fragments and creating transiently expressed cDNA sequences. When appropriate, the oligonucleotides were designed with Kpnl, BglII, or BamHI restriction enzyme overhangs (not listed) and this feature was used to facilitate subsequent cloning into the respective sites of the vector, as described under “Materials and Methods.” All sequences correspond to the human gene, unless indicated as “mouse.” Mutations are shown as bold sequence.ClonePrimers+2224/+1418, mouseForward: 5′-CCGCCAAGGACAAAAGGA-3′Reverse: 5′-GAAAGCCCAAGGATTCCAC-3′–227/+1465, mouseForward: 5′-GGATCCGGCTCCGTAATTA-3′Reverse: 5′-GAAGCTTGTGGAGCAGCCT-3′–1111/+59Forward: 5′-TGCCCTGCCCAATTTCTCCC-3′Reverse: 5′-GGTCGGGCTGCTGCTAGCAG-3′–512/+59Forward: 5′-TCAGGACAACCTTGCTGCCTTG-3′Reverse: 5′-GGTCGGGCTGCTGCTAGCAG-3′–222/–1Forward: 5′-GGGCTTTGCGGGAGAGTCTTGGGG-3′Reverse: 5′-GGAGCAGCCCTGCGAGCGGC-3′–218/+770Forward: 5′-CTTTGCGGGAGAGTCTTGGGGGCGC-3′Reverse: 5′-CCCGCGAGTGCTACGCCCGC-3′–512/+698Forward: 5′-TCAGGACAACCTTGCTGCCTTG-3′Reverse: 5′-GTCAAATGTTCCCAACTCGT-3′AAREForward: 5′-CCTAGGGACGATCGATATTGCATCAGTTTTCTTTCCCATGGG-3′Reverse: 5′-CCATGGGAAAGAAAACTGATGCAATATCGATCGTCCCTAGGG-3′CAAT/AAREForward: 5′-CCATGGACATTTGACAATCGACGATCGATATTGCATCAGTTTTCTTTCAGATCTAGG-3′Reverse: 5′-GAAAGAAAACTGATGCAATATCGATCGTCGATTGTCAAATGTCCATGGAGATCTTCC-3′+689/+754Forward: 5′-ACATTTGACAATCGACGATCGATATTGCATCAGTTTTCTTTCCGGACATAGGAGGGGCTGGGCGGG-3′;Reverse: 5′-CCCGCCCAGCCCCTCTATGTCCGGAAAGAAAACTGATGCAATATCGATCGTCGATTGTCAAATGT-3′CAAT box mutantForward primer 5′-CGAGTTGGGAACATTTGACCTGCGACGATCG-3′Reverse primer: 5′-CGATCGTCGCAGGTCAAATGTTCCCAACTCG-3′AARE mutantForward primer 5′-CGACGATCGATAATGCCCCAGTTTTCTTTCCGGACA-3′Reverse primer: 5′-TGTCCGGAAAGAAAACTGGGGCATTATCGATCGTCG-3′PuR box mutantForward primer 5′-CCGGACATAGGAGTTTCTGGGCGGGCG-3′Reverse primer: 5′-CGCCCGCCCAGAAACTCCTATGTCCGG-3′ Open table in a new tab Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assays—Human HepG2 hepatoma cells were seeded in 24-well plates at the density of 1.5 × 105 cells/well, supplied with complete MEM and grown for 24 h. Transfection was performed with 1 μg of plasmid DNA per 105 cells and the Superfect reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) was present at a ratio of 1:6 μg of DNA/μl of reagent, according to the manufacturer's protocol. When appropriate, a human asparagine synthetase construct incorporating the promoter fragment nt -115/+1 in front of the firefly luciferase was used as a positive control for the amino acid deprivation response (29Zhong C. Chen C. Kilberg M.S. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 603-609Google Scholar). Each well also received 5 ng of pRL-SV40 plasmid (Renilla luciferase) to serve as a control for transfection efficiency. After 3 h, cells were rinsed once with phosphate-buffered saline and given fresh MEM. At 16 h post-transfection, the medium was removed, the cells were rinsed once with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 10 h in 1 ml/well of either complete MEM or MEM lacking histidine (MEM-His), each supplemented with 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. After the completion of treatment, the cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, lysed with 100 μl of 1× Passive lysis buffer (Promega), and then subjected to one freeze-thaw cycle to assure complete disruption of the membranes. Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured in a Sirius luminometer (Berthold Detection Systems, GmbH, Germany) using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega).Site-directed Mutagenesis—To generate the mutant sequences, a plasmid containing the human SNAT2 sequence from nt -512/+770 was used as a wild-type template. The mutagenesis was performed with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The identity and fidelity of the constructs was verified by sequencing. The mutagenic primers used are presented in Table I (the mutated nucleotides are in bold and underlined). To generate mutants for multiple sites, plasmids containing mutated sequences were used as templates for additional rounds of site-directed mutagenesis.Nuclear Extract Preparation and Electrophoresis Mobility Shift Assay—HepG2 cells were seeded on 150-mm dishes (15 × 106 cells per dish). After 16 h of culture, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 4 h in either complete MEM or MEM lacking histidine, both supplemented with 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. The nuclear extraction was performed as previously described (30Leung-Pineda V. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16585-16591Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined using a modified Lowry assay (31Kilberg M.S. Methods Enzyme. 1989; 173: 564-575Google Scholar). Single-stranded oligonucleotides were annealed by adding 4.8 nmol of each oligonucleotide, with 20 μl of 10× annealing buffer (100 nm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 m sodium chloride, 10 mm EDTA) in a total volume of 200 μl. The oligonucleotide solution was heated to 95 °C for 5 min and then allowed to gradually cool to 4 °C over 2 h. The oligonucleotides used as either electrophoresis mobility shift assay probes or competitors are listed in Table II. The double-stranded oligonucleotides were radiolabeled by extension of overlapping ends with Klenow fragment in the presence of [α-32P]dATP. For each binding reaction, 10 μg of nuclear extract protein was incubated with 40 mm Tris base, 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.05% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 3 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Biosciences), 0.04 pmol of unrelated DNA (see Table II), and 0.05 mm EDTA for 20 min on ice. The radiolabeled probe was added at a concentration of 0.02 pmol/reaction (∼20,000 cpm), and unlabeled competitor oligonucleotides were added at the indicated concentrations. The reaction mixture, 30 μl final volume, was incubated at room temperature for 20 min. The reactions were subjected to electrophoresis as described previously (30Leung-Pineda V. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16585-16591Google Scholar).Table IIElectrophoretic mobility shift analysis probes and competitors Each pair of oligonucleotides was designed to produce a 5′ overhang of 2-3 nucleotides after annealing. Radiolabeled probes were then produced by extension of overlapping ends with Klenow fragment in the presence of [α-32P]dATP. To produce blunt-ended competitor oligonucleotides, the same protocol was used with unlabeled dNTPs. The table lists the double-stranded DNA sequences with filled-in ends.

The GenBank™ accession numbers for SNAT2 sequences were: human, NT_029419 and AF298897; mouse, AC109201 and XM_128198.2; and rat, NW_044046.1 and XM_217051. The genomic sequences for the mouse, rat, and human SNAT2 genes were aligned using the Vector NTI suite version 7 (Infor-Max, Inc., Bethesda, MD). The GenBank™ accession numbers used to obtain the intronic sequences were: mouse, AC109201; rat, NW_044046.1; and human, NT_029419.RESULTSSNAT2 Gene Structure Is Similar in Three Mammalian Species—An mRNA to genomic alignment was employed to visualize the SNAT2 gene structures for human, mouse, and rat. In all three species examined, the gene consists of 16 exons and 15 introns, with exon 1 encoding most of the 5′-untranslated region (Fig. 1). The apparent translation start and stop codons are located in exons 2 and 16, respectively.SNAT2 mRNA Content Is Increased following Amino Acid Deprivation—To determine whether HepG2 hepatoma cells were a suitable model for our study, a comparative analysis of SNAT2 mRNA levels was conducted in three human cell lines: HepG2 hepatoma, Huh7 hepatoma, and HeLa cells. Consistent with previous results, SNAT2 mRNA content was increased in all cell lines examined, with enhancements of 7 to 17 times the control values (Fig. 2). Given the extensive information on System A activity and amino acid control of transcription that has been published in HepG2 cells, these cells were chosen as the model system for the remaining experiments.Fig. 2SNAT2 mRNA content in three human cell lines. Cells were incubated for 12 h in either complete MEM (MEM) or amino acid-free Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (-AA). Northern blot analysis with total mRNA extracted from Huh7 hepatoma, HepG2 hepatoma, and HeLa cells was performed as described under “Materials and Methods.” The blots were hybridized with radiolabeled cDNA probes specific for SNAT2 or L7a (Panel A). Quantification of the Northern blot analysis (Panel B) was performed by scanning densitometry of the film and data assembly as described under “Materials and Methods.” Statistically significant differences are indicated by asterisks, *, p < 0.005.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Transcription from the SNAT2 Promoter Does Not Change in Response to Amino Acid Deprivation—To identify the genomic sequences necessary for the amino acid-dependent regulation of the human SNAT2 gene, several fragments of its promoter region were tested using firefly luciferase as the reporter. Previous data has shown that luciferase enzymatic activity actually underestimates the amount of transcription in amino acid-deprived cells (32Siu F.Y. Chen C. Zhong C. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48100-48107Google Scholar). An asparagine synthetase promoter construct containing nt -115/+1 was used as a positive control (29Zhong C. Chen C. Kilberg M.S. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 603-609Google Scholar). The luciferase activities in cells transfected with the human SNAT2 upstream genomic fragments nt -512/+59 or -1111/+59 did not change significantly in response to amino acid removal, whereas the asparagine synthetase promoter construct yielded about a 10-fold increase in the luciferase activity (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, no amino acid-dependent transcription was observed when a longer human SNAT2 genomic fragment (nt -4086/+59) was tested (data not shown). These results suggested that the amino acid response element of the human SNAT2 gene might not reside in the 5′ upstream region. Transfection of two different mouse genomic fragments, nt -1255/+191 or nt -227/+1, also resulted in no detectable amino acid-regulated transcription (Fig. 3B).Fig. 3Transcription from the SNAT2 5′ upstream sequence does not change in response to amino acid deprivation. HepG2 cells were transiently transfected with firefly luciferase reporter constructs containing the indicated genomic fragments of either the human (Panel A) or mouse (Panel B) SNAT2 5′ upstream sequence. The human asparagine synthetase proximal promoter (Asns (asparagine synthetase) nt -115 to +1) was used as a positive control. Sixteen hours after transfection, the cells were incubated for 10 h in either complete (MEM) medium or medium lacking histidine (-His), harvested, and the luciferase activities were measured as described under “Materials and Methods.” Statistically significant differences are indicated by an asterisk, *, p < 0.005.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)A SNAT2 Amino Acid Responsive Element Is Located in the First Intron—To investigate the possibility of an AARE located downstream of the transcription start site, several constructs were prepared from the mouse gene that contained a minimal promoter region (nt -227/+1) as well as downstream genomic sequences through nt +764. These sequences were cloned into the firefly luciferase reporter vector and their ability to drive regulated transcription was measured under histidine-deprived conditions (Fig. 4A). A construct containing the proximal promoter, the entire exon 1, and a large portion of intron 1 (nt -227/+764) exhibited a relatively small, but reproducible increase in transcription following histidine deprivation. Deletion in the 5′ direction yielded two constructs (nt -227/+627, -227/+571) that had significantly less basal transcription, but maintained a high rate of transcription following amino acid limitation (Fig. 4A). Further deletion to a fragment containing nt -227/+467 resulted in a complete loss of the regulated transcription. When the corresponding regions of the human gene were tested, similar results were obtained (Fig. 4B). The human proximal promoter (nt -222/-1) was negative with regard to enhancement of transcription, while including 770 nt of the downstream sequence, in combination with either 218 or 512 nt of the upstream human SNAT2 promoter region, resulted in amino acid-regulated transcription. Deletion of the nt -512/+770 fragment to one containing nt -512/+698 resulted in loss of the amino acid responsiveness (Fig. 4B). Collectively, the data demonstrate that both the human and mouse SNAT2 genes contain an AARE activity that is located in intron 1 and, for the human gene, the AARE resides within nt +698/+770.Fig. 4Amino acid responsive elements are located in the first intron of the SNAT2 gene. HepG2 cells were transiently transfected with luciferase reporter constructs containing the indicated genomic fragments of either the mouse (Panel A) or human (Panel B) SNAT2 gene. Sixteen hours after transfection, the cells were incubated for 10 h in complete (MEM) medium or medium lacking histidine (-His), then lysed and the luciferase activities were measured as described under “Materials and Methods.” Statistically significant differences are indicated by asterisks, *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.005.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)A Specific SNAT2 Intronic Sequence Is Required for Amino Acid-dependent Regulation—Given that the AARE activity of the human SNAT2 gene was contained within a 72-nt sequence, the respective regions from the human, mouse, and rat genomes were aligned (Fig. 5). Three highly conserved sequence regions were identified. Interestingly, sequence 1 (nt +693/+701) includes a CAAT motif and will be called the “CAAT box,” sequence 2 (nt +707/+723) contains a 9-nucleotide core that is identical to the human CHOP AARE and will be termed the “AARE,” and sequence 3 (nt +738/+746) is a purine-rich sequence of 9 nucleotides that will be referred to as the “purine-rich (PuR) box.” The corresponding genomic sequence numbers for the mouse and rat genomes are shown in Fig. 5B. To test whether or not these three conserved sequences are functionally important for amino acid-dependent regulation, multiple mutations within each of these boxes were produced in the context of the human SNAT2 -512/+770 genomic fragment (Fig. 6A). The wild-type sequence nt -512/+770 yielded an increase of 15 times control in response to histidine limitation (Fig. 6B). Mutagenesis of the CAAT sequence had no effect on basal transcription, but decreased the induced rate to about 40%"
https://openalex.org/W2128890789,"Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is a multifunctional protein with glycolytic and non-glycolytic functions, including pro-apoptotic activity. GAPDH accumulates in the nucleus after cells are treated with genotoxic drugs, and it is present in a protein complex that binds DNA modified by thioguanine incorporation. We identified a novel CRM1-dependent nuclear export signal (NES) comprising 13 amino acids (KKVVKQASEGPLK) in the C-terminal domain of GAPDH, truncation or mutation of which abrogated CRM1 binding and caused nuclear accumulation of GAPDH. Alanine scanning of the sequence encompassing the putative NES demonstrated at least two regions important for nuclear export. Site mutagenesis of Lys259 did not affect oligomerization but impaired nuclear efflux of GAPDH, indicating that this amino acid residue is essential for proper functioning of this NES. This novel NES does not contain multiple leucine residues unlike other CRM1-interacting NES, is conserved in GAPDH from multiple species, and has sequence similarities to the export signal found in feline immunodeficiency virus Rev protein.

Falluel-Morel A. Leuillet S. Vaudry H. Gonzalez B.J. Science. 2003; 300: 1532-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). GAPDH also participates in membrane, cytoplasmic, and nuclear functions for endocytosis, mRNA regulation, tRNA export, DNA replication, and DNA repair (2Sirover M.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 66: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 3Sirover M.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1432: 159-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Some species, including humans and mouse, contain more than one functional GAPDH gene and a diversity of pseudogenes (4Ishitani R. Tajima H. Takata H. Tsuchiya K. Kuwae T. Yamada M. Takahashi H. Tatton N.A. Katsube N. Prog. Neuropsychopharmacol. Biol. Psychiatry. 2003; 27: 291-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In its monomeric form, GAPDH has a molecular mass of ∼37 kDa, however, within cells, it exists mainly as a tetramer comprising four identical 37-kDa subunits (3Sirover M.A. Biochim. Biophys.

An increase in nuclear GAPDH is required for its apoptotic effects, which appear to be upstream from events that mediate apoptotic degradation (13Carlile G.W. Chalmers-Redman R.M. Tatton N.A. Pong A. Borden K.E. Tatton W.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 2-12PubMed Google Scholar), and the nuclear accumulation of GAPDH precedes chromatin condensation, nuclear fragmentation, and a decline in mitochondrial membrane protein (14Dastoor Z. Dreyer J.L. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1643-1653Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This is consistent with the reported involvement of GAPDH in apoptosis of primary cultures of cerebellar neurons following nuclear translocation (9Ishitani R. Sunaga K. Tanaka M. Aishita H. Chuang D.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 542-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and the induction of intranuclear translocation of GAPDH by treatment of cells with thiopurines (12Krynetski E.Y. Krynetskaia N.F. Gallo A.E. Murti K.G. Evans W.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 367-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Moreover, significant correlation has been shown between basal intranuclear GAPDH in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell lines and sensitivity to thiopurine treatment (12Krynetski E.Y. Krynetskaia N.F. Gallo A.E. Murti K.G. Evans W.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 367-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Recently, GAPDH was identified as a component of a nuclear protein complex that recognizes duplex DNA into which fraudulent nucleosides (e.g. thioguanosine, cytosine arabinoside, or 5-fluorouridine) have been incorporated (15Krynetski E.Y. Krynetskaia N.F. Bianchi M.E. Evans W.E. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 100-106PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro treatment of the complex with monoclonal anti-GAPDH antibody (anti-GAPDH mAb) resulted in its dissociation (12Krynetski E.Y. Krynetskaia N.F. Gallo A.E. Murti K.G. Evans W.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 367-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This observation led us to hypothesize that the corresponding epitope recognized by anti-GAPDH mAb is localized at or near the surface involved in protein-protein interactions and provided the basis for the present study to characterize the region(s) of the GAPDH polypeptide chain involved in protein-protein interactions. We identified the region of GAPDH, which constitutes the anti-GAPDH mAb binding site, and demonstrated involvement of this region in binding with other nuclear proteins. Finally, we demonstrated that this region interacts with components of the nuclear export system and defines intracellular localization of GAPDH. Elucidating the mechanism of nuclear targeting of GAPDH has identified a novel nuclear export signal and provided new insights into disease pathogenesis and drug-induced apoptosis. Cell Cultures and Nuclear Extract Precipitation—Colon adenocarcinoma cell lines SW620 and DLD1 were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Cell lines were grown in RPMI 1640 (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen, Palo Alto, CA) and 1.0% l-glutamine. Cytotoxic effects of thiopurines (Sigma, St. Louis MO) were determined using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay (16Pieters R. Huismans D.R. Leyva A. Veerman A.J. Cancer Lett. 1988; 41: 323-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) after incubation of SW620 and DLD1 cells with mercaptopurine (MP, 0.001-180 μm) or thioguanine (TG, 0.001-100 μm) for 3-6 days. The concentrations of MP or TG were determined by spectrophotometer at 320 and 340 nm, respectively. The 96-well plates were read by a microplate spectrophotometer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The IC50 values were obtained by fitting a sigmoid Emax model to the cell viability (%) versus concentrations of drug (micromolar), determined in triplicate. Experiments were performed using an initial concentration of 1 × 105 cells/ml of media before the addition of either MP or TG. In subsequent experiments, thiopurines were added to the media in a single dose to achieve a concentration of 10 μm MP or 10 μm TG in the growth medium. The human T-lineage leukemia cell line Molt4 was obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA); the human T-lineage leukemia P12 and B-lineage Nalm6 cell lines were obtained from the DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (Braunschweig, Germany). Cell number and viability were determined in duplicate in a Burker-Turk chamber using trypan blue exclusion. All experiments were started with an initial concentration of 0.25 × 106 cells/ml. Nuclear extracts from human acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells (Molt4, CEM, or Nalm6) were prepared according to Dignam et al. (17Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9160) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by Bradford dye-binding procedure using Bio-Rad protein assay. Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography—2.0 mg of GAPDH from human erythrocytes (control; Sigma, St. Louis, MO), K259N mutant GAPDH protein and total nuclear protein from ALL cells were analyzed by FPLC on Superdex 200 HR 10/30 columns (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) in elution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 100 mm KCl) at 0.3-0.4 ml/min at 4 °C. Composition of eluate was monitored by spectrophotometer at 280 nm. Fractions (0.25 ml) were collected during the FPLC separation and concentrated to 25 μl using an Ultrafree 0.5 centrifugal filter and tube (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and analyzed by Western blot. Membranes were developed with anti-GAPDH monoclonal antibody (mAb; Chemicon, Temecula, CA) (18Krynetskaia N.F. Brenner T.L. Krynetski E.Y. Du W. Panetta J.C. Ching-Hon P. Evans W.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 456-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Glycolytic Assay—GAPDH glycolytic activity was measured by spectrophotometric assay at 340 nm. Briefly, the assay was carried out in 0.015 m sodium pyrophosphate, 0.03 m sodium arsenate (Sigma), pH 8.5, in the presence of 3.5 mm DTT, 0.26 mm NAD+, and 0.51 mm glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (Sigma) using human GAPDH (Sigma) or cellular lysates or nuclear extracts. The reactions were performed for 10 min at 25 °C. Identification of mAb Epitope Using Pin-bound Peptides—Pin-bound peptides representing the entire GAPDH polypeptide sequence were synthesized using Multipin Peptide Synthesis kit (Chiron Technologies, San Diego, CA) in the Hartwell Center for Biotechnology (St. Jude Children's Research Hospital) using standard peptide synthesis and Sepharose Coupling. Identification of epitopes was performed according to manufacturer's instructions, using monoclonal antibody (clone 6C5; Chemicon, Temecula, CA) at a concentration of 500 ng/ml, and secondary anti-mouse HRP-conjugated antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA) at a concentration of 50 ng/ml. A series of overlapping pin-bound 15-mer peptides was incubated with anti-GAPDH monoclonal anti-GAPDH antibody, and the IgG complex with antigen was detected by incubation with HPR-conjugated secondary antibody. Data were collected using a microplate reader at 405 nm. Affinity Chromatography—Cellular or nuclear extract from 1 × 108 cells (200 μl) was incubated with peptide 51 (DDIKKVVKQASEGPL) or peptide 52 (KPAKYDDIKKVVKQA) immobilized on Sepharose in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 5 mm NaCl, 0.3 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm DTT (Buffer 1) in a 2-ml column for 30 min at room temperature. Column was washed with 15 ml of Buffer 1 and then eluted with 10 ml of Buffer 1 containing 1 m NaCl (0.3 ml/min). Fractions were collected, concentrated, and analyzed by SDS gel electrophoresis and silver staining. Mass Spectroscopy of Proteins—Proteins localized by silver staining following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were excised from the gel, and digested with trypsin. The peptides thus released from the gel plug were subjected to analysis by combined liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry using an LCQ-Deca ion-trap mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA) coupled with a capillary high-performance liquid chromatography system (Waters, Milford MA). Peptides were separated by reversed-phase chromatography using a 320-μm I.D. column packed with Waters Delta-Pak C18 stationary phase by Microtech Scientific (Santa Clara, CA). Peptides were assigned to known proteins on the basis of searches of the NCBI non-redundant protein data base performed on product ion spectra using the SEQUEST algorithm. Plasmid Preparation—GAPDH cDNA was prepared by RT-PCR from total RNA isolated from 697 human pre-B leukemia cells. The forward primer, 5′-TGTACATGGGCGGAGGCGGAGGCATGGGGAAGGTGAAGGTCG-3′, contained a NotI site, a 15-mer encoding (Gly)5 link and the first 20 nucleotides (including the initiation codon) of the coding sequence of the GAPDH cDNA. The reverse primer, 5′-GCGGCCGCTTACTCCTTGGAGGCCATGT-3′, contained a BsrG1 binding site and the last 20 nucleotides (including the termination codon) of the coding sequence of the GAPDH cDNA. The modified GAPDH cDNA was cloned into pcDNA3.1/EGFP to obtain the pcDNA3.1/GFP-(Gly)5-GAPDH fusion construct (6Schmitz H.D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 80: 419-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 19Schmitz H.D. Bereiter-Hahn J. Cell Biol. Int. 2002; 26 (20): 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The portion of the pEGFP vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) containing the coding region for EGFP was previously cloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) using conventional methods (20Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Vol. 1. John Wiley and Sons Inc., New York1991: 3.16.1-3.16.2Google Scholar). Truncated and mutated hybrids of the fusion constructs were prepared by site mutagenesis (Fig. 1). Sequences of all constructs were verified by DNA sequencing at the Hartwell Center for Bioinformatics and Biotechnology at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. Functional Characterization of the Putative NES—Fig. 1 depicts the truncated (T1, T2, and T3) or mutated (K259N and Ala mutants M1-M6) GAPDH constructs. The GFP-tagged truncated GAPDH T1 contains nucleotides 1-774, which encodes the N terminus, however, it lacks any part of the putative NES. The truncated construct, T2, contains nucleotides 1-786, which encodes the N terminus and the first four amino acids, KKVV, of the putative NES. The second truncated construct, T2, contains nucleotides 806-1008, which encodes the last three amino acids, PLK, of the putative NES and the rest of the C terminus of GAPDH. In the GFP-tagged mutated fusion constructs 1-6, amino acids, including those within the putative NES, were sequentially replaced with four alanine residues. Additionally, a mutant hybrid of the fusion construct was generated in which lysine 259 was mutated to asparagine (K259N). Transfection Assay—Transient transfection was done using LipofectAMINE Reagent 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Expression of the GFP fusion construct in the cell lines was documented by fluorescence microscopy. Flow cytometry was used to separate transfected from non-transfected cells, and the transfected cells were grown in 1 mg/ml G418 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) until colonies were formed. Individual colonies were placed in a Petri dish containing 2 ml of growth medium supplemented with 1 mg/ml G418 and incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 until the cells achieved ∼80% confluence. The confluent cells were trypsinized and grown in a flask containing the appropriate growth medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1 mg/ml G418. Immunoprecipitation—Total cell lysate was prepared as recommended by Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), and protein concentration was determined using the PlusOne 2-D Quant kit (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). Immunoprecipitation was performed using a modification of the method suggested by Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Briefly, 80 μl of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer was added to 5-10 μg (in 20 μl) of total cell lysate, and the mixture was precleared by adding 0.25 μg (in 5 μl) of normal rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and 20 μl of Protein G Plus-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. After the incubation, the beads were pelleted by centrifugation at 2500 rpm for 5 min, and the supernatant was transferred to a fresh 1-ml microcentrifuge tube at 4 °C. 0.19 μg/μl (in 20 μl) of rabbit anti-GFP polyclonal antibody (Clontech) was added to the supernatant, and the mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. After incubation, 20 μl of Protein G Plus-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added to the mixture, followed by incubation overnight at 4 °C with constant rotation. The pellet was collected by centrifugation at 2500 rpm for 5 min, washed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer four times, and then re-suspended in 10 μl of Nu-PAGE LDS 4× sample buffer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), vortexed, and boiled at 100 °C for 5 min. After cooling, 10 μl of running buffer and 1 μl of 1 m DTT was added to the boiled sample, and the mixture was separated on 10-12% Nu-PAGE gel (Invitrogen). Western Analysis—After immunoprecipitation and SDS-electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to a Hybond-P membrane (Amersham Biosciences) by electrotransfer. The membrane was then incubated with mouse anti-CRM1 mAb antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories, San Diego, CA). Bound antibodies were detected using goat anti-mouse IgG HRP conjugate (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and ECL-Plus kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membrane was washed and re-developed with Rabbit anti-GFP polyclonal antibody (Clontech) and goat anti-rabbit IgG HRP conjugate as secondary antibody conjugate (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Confocal Microscopy—Samples were examined using a Leica TCS NT SP confocal laser scanning microscope equipped with argon (488 nm) and krypton (568 nm) lasers. Endogenous GAPDH was stained using mouse anti-GAPDH (Chemicon) as primary antibody and goat anti-mouse IgG fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as secondary antibody, and the nuclei were stained with propidium iodide (PI). GFP-positive cells were stained with PI. Samples were imaged with detector slit widths of 500-548 nm in the green, or fluorescein isothiocyanate channel; and 580-609 nm in the red, or PI channel, using a 100× plan apochromatic 1.4 numerical aperture oil immersion objective. Overlay images combining the green and red channels were produced using the Leica software, and the images were re-scaled and gamma-corrected in Adobe Photoshop. The nuclear and cytoplasmic fluorescence intensities were quantified using a published procedure. Single section images containing 20-40 cells were used in the analysis to determine the nuclear and cytoplasmic fluorescence (single fixed intensity × number of pixels per nucleus or cytoplasm). The nuclear area is defined by the red fluorescence due to propidium iodide. Intracellular Localization of Endogenous GAPDH and GFP-GAPDH—In untreated cells, endogenous GAPDH was localized mainly in the cytosol of colon adenocarcinoma cells (SW620 and DLD1), as revealed by immunostaining and confocal microscopy (Fig. 2A). However, following 24-48 h of thiopurine treatment (either MP or TG), GAPDH accumulated predominantly in the nucleus, with exclusion from the nucleoli. Fig. 2B shows the distribution of endogenous GAPDH in SW620 cells after 24 h of treatment with 10 μm MP. GAPDH was localized predominantly in the cytoplasm of DLD1 cells expressing the GFP-GAPDH fusion construct, similar to endogenous GAPDH, as illustrated in Fig. 2C (compared with Fig. 2A). Treatment of DLD1 cells expressing the GFP-GAPDH fusion construct with 10 μm thiopurine resulted in subcellular redistribution of GAPDH, with accumulation in the nucleus and exclusion from the nucleoli, after 48 h of thiopurine treatment (Fig. 2, E and D, compared with C). This was similar to that observed for endogenous GAPDH (Fig. 2B). Therefore, GFP-GAPDH fusion construct (Fig. 1) was used as a model to assess the effect of truncation or mutation on the localization of GAPDH. In control experiments with SW620 and DLD1 cells expressing EGFP vector, GFP was uniformly present in both cytoplasm and nucleus (data not shown). Thiopurine treatment of SW620 and DLD1 cells expressing EGFP vector had no effect on the cellular distribution of EGFP (data not shown). Identification of the Anti-GAPDH-bound Epitope within the GAPDH Polypeptide Chain—Pepscan technology was used to delineate the amino acid sequences of peptides that constitute the epitope of GAPDH recognized by anti-GAPDH mAb. Peptides 51 and 52, corresponding to overlapping segments 250KPAKYDDIKKVVKQA264 and 255DDIKKVVKQASEGPL269, respectively, gave the highest absorption at 405 nm (>2 optical units/ml) (Fig. 3A), and reaction with the other peptides resulted in negligible absorption (0.038-0.1 optical units405/ml). Treatment with monoclonal anti-PCNA antibody (a negative control) did not result in any signal, indicating the lack of nonspecific interaction with pin-bound peptides (data not shown). N-terminal sequencing verified the sequences of pin-bound peptides 51 and 52. Unbound peptides 51 and 52 inhibited immunostaining of GAPDH in Western analysis, thus confirming specific binding of anti-GAPDH MAb with epitopes encompassing amino acids 250-269 of GAPDH (data not shown). Putative NES Involved in Protein-Protein Interaction—Incubation of cellular lysate from Molt4 cells with 256DDIKKVVKQASEGPL270 covalently bound to Sepharose resulted in specific binding of GAPDH, as confirmed by SDS gel electrophoresis and mass-spectroscopy (Fig. 3B). One major and at least four minor bands were detected by silver staining of the gel. Electrospray mass spectrometry of the major band identified it as GAPDH (Fig. 3B). The identified peptide sequence within GAPDH is conserved across different species (human, Homo sapiens; rabbit, Oryctolagus cuniculis; lobster, Homarus americanus; and Palinurus versicolor) and contains invariant amino acid residues, conservative substitutions, and non-conservative changes as illustrated in Fig. 3C. This GAPDH peptide sequence is comparable to FIV Rev protein that has an atypical nuclear export signal (Fig. 3C). Oligomeric Forms and Glycolytic Activity of Nuclear GAPDH—Gel filtration FPLC chromatography depicts a typical profile of purified K259N mutant and wild-type GAPDH extracted from human erythrocytes used as control. The FPLC profile revealed that both wild-type and mutant GAPDH were eluted as tetramers with a molecular mass of 144 kDa (Fig. 4A). No peaks with molecular mass higher than 144 kDa were detected. The chromatography of nuclear extracts from ALL cells (P12, Molt4, and Nalm6) in non-denaturing conditions and subsequent Western blot analysis of the collected fractions revealed that GAPDH was present in several oligomeric forms or high molecular weight complexes in the nuclear compartment of untreated lymphoblast cells. Fig. 4B (analysis of nuclear protein from Molt4 cells) depicts a typical FPLC profile of nuclear protein distribution for ALL cells. Fractions 24-25 contained a high molecular weight protein complex exceeding the exclusion volume of the column (i.e. more than 2 × 106 Da), and fractions 35-43 contained different oligomeric forms of GAPDH, including the monomeric, dimeric, and tetrameric forms (Fig. 4, B and C). Measurement of enzymatic activity in the nuclear extracts and cellular lysates from P12, Molt4, and Nalm6 cell lines revealed that GAPDH activity in the nucleus of untreated Molt 4, P12, and Nalm6 cells was lower when compared with cellular lysates (Fig. 4D). Modification of the Putative NES Changes Intracellular Distribution of GAPDH—We performed alanine scanning using Ala tetrapeptide sequence (AAAA) across the entire length of the tested region (Fig. 1). GFP-GAPDH mutant proteins bearing Ala4 substitution in different positions of the putative NES revealed different distribution between cellular compartments. DLD1 cells stably expressing the GFP-tagged Ala mutants M1 and M4 demonstrated cytoplasmic localization of the mutant GFP-GAPDH as depicted by green GFP fluorescence (Fig. 5, A, B, G, and H, respectively). However, there is evidence of some nuclear rim association illustrated by the yellow border around the red PI-stained nucleus. GFP-tagged Ala mutant M2 was localized in both nucleus and cytoplasm of DLD1 cells (Fig. 5, C and D). In contrast, DLD1 cells stably expressing Ala-mutated GFP-tagged fusion construct M3 exhibited predominantly nuclear accumulation of the Ala mutated GAPDH fusion construct (Fig. 5, E and F). Similar distribution of GAPDH was observed in cells stably expressing the GFP-tagged Ala mutants M5 (Fig. 5, I and J) and M6 (Fig. 5, K and L). DLD1 cells stably expressing the truncated GFP-tagged fusion construct T1 exhibited predominantly nuclear accumulation of the truncated GAPDH fusion construct (Fig. 6, A and B). Cells stably expressing the GFP-tagged fusion construct T2 exhibited mainly nuclear localization of the T2 GAPDH fusion construct (Fig. 6, C and D). Similar distribution of GAPDH was observed in cells stably expressing the GFP-tagged T3 (data not shown). Stable expression of the K259N mutant fusion construct in DLD1 cells resulted in nuclear accumulation of GAPDH in the absence of thiopurine treatment (Fig. 6, G and H). The localization of K259N was similar to that exhibited by DLD1 cells stably expressing Ala-mutated GFP-tagged fusion constructs M3 (Fig. 5, E and F), M5 (Fig. 5, I and J), and M6 (Fig. 5, K and L). Effect of Thiopurine Treatment on Nuclear Accumulation of Modified GAPDH—Truncated or mutated forms of GAPDH, which accumulated in the nucleus, did not change nuclear localization of fluorescence after thiopurine treatment. Interestingly, the treatment of cells expressing the truncated fusion protein T2 with 10 μm thiopurine (TG or MP) resulted in nuclear rim association (Fig. 6, E compared with C). No further intracellular accumulation of GAPDH was observed in cells expressing the K259N mutant construct following thiopurine treatment. Similar observations were made for both SW620 and DLD1 cell lines. Leptomycin B Prevents Export of GFP-GAPDH from the Nucleus—Treatment for 2 h with 2.5 ng/ml leptomycin B (LMB), an inhibitor of CRM1-mediated nuclear export, resulted in subcellular redistribution of GAPDH from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in DLD1 cells (Fig. 7, compare A and B with C and D). Similar results were obtained when SW620 cells were treated with LMB (data not shown). Co-immunoprecipitation of GAPDH and CRM1—Western analysis using anti-GFP antibody indicated that GFP-GAPDH fusion protein was present in the cell lysate and in the anti-GFP antibody immunoprecipitate from DLD1 cells transfected with the GFP-GAPDH expression vector (Fig. 8A, lane 3, lower panel). Western analysis with anti-CRM1 antibody revealed that CRM1 was present in the immunoprecipitate, indicating that CRM1 was associated with the GFP-GAPDH fusion protein (Fig. 8A, lane 4, upper panel). In control experiments, the immunoblot of membranes obtained from DLD1 cells expressing the EGFP vector, using anti-GFP and anti-CRM1 antibodies,"

However, its precise role in this complex process remains controversial. To more thoroughly examine the role of the MEK-ERK kinase cascade in chondrogenesis, we analyzed the effects of two structurally different pharmacological inhibitors of MEK, the upstream kinase activator of ERK, on chondrocyte differentiation in micromass cultures of embryonic chick limb mesenchyme cells. We found that the MEK inhibitors, U0126 and PD98059, promote increased accumulation of cartilage-characteristic mRNA transcripts for type II collagen, aggrecan, and the transcription factor, Sox9. PD98059 treatment stimulated increased deposition of sulfated glycosaminoglycan into both Alcian blue-stainable cartilage matrix and the surrounding culture medium, whereas U0126 elevated glycosaminoglycan secretion into the medium fraction alone. Both MEK inhibitors increased total type II collagen protein accumulation in micromass culture and elevated the activity of a transfected type II collagen enhancer-luciferase reporter gene. Thus, pharmacological MEK inhibition induced increased expression of multiple chondrocyte differentiation markers. Conversely, transfection of limb mesenchyme cells with a constitutively active MEK1 plasmid resulted in a prominent decrease in the activity of a co-transfected type II collagen enhancer-luciferase reporter gene. Collectively, these findings support the hypothesis that signaling through the MEK-ERK kinase cascade may function as an important inhibitory regulator of embryonic cartilage differentiation.

During organogenesis of the vertebrate embryo, cells from three distinct mesenchymal lineages (sclerotome, somatopleure, and neural crest) independently undergo chondrogenesis and form the multiple cartilages of the primary skeleton. Despite differences in cellular origin and anatomical location, all of the cartilaginous elements are thought to arise following a common chondrogenic differentiation pathway (1Lefebvre V. Behringer R.R. de Crombrugghe B. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2001; 9: 69-75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). At the sites of the future skeletal elements, the chondrogenic progenitors initially reside as a dispersed population of undifferentiated mesenchyme cells. Subsequently, the prechondrogenic cells initiate a process of condensation in which they assemble into high density, compact aggregates (2Hall B.K. Miyake T. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 138-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). The intimate juxta-position of mesenchymal cells within the precartilage aggregates enables crucial cell-cell interactions that trigger overt chondrocyte differentiation. In this stage, the prechondrogenic cells lose their fibroblastic-like phenotype in exchange for the spherical morphology of chondrocytes and commence synthesis of cartilage-specific extracellular matrix molecules such as type II collagen and the large chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, aggrecan (3Hoffman L.M. Weston A.D. Underhill T.M. J. Bone Joint Surg. Am. 2003; 85-A: 124-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). A variety of extracellular signaling ligands have been implicated in the process of precartilage condensation and the activation of chondrocyte differentiation.

Most recently, the Wnt family of secreted glycoproteins has been suggested to play important regulatory roles in chondrogenesis (11Tuan R.S. J. Bone Joint Surg. Am. 2003; 85-A: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Many nuclear factors involved in chondrocyte differentiation have also been identified. Expression of the transcription factor, Sox9, is required for cartilage formation (12Bi W. Deng J.M. Zhang Z. Behringer R.R. de Crombrugghe B. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (1415) Google Scholar) and precedes detectable up-regulation of the cartilage-specific type II collagen and aggrecan genes during in vitro chondrogenesis (13Kulyk W.M. Franklin J.L. Hoffman L.M. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 255: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Other Sox family transcription factors, specifically L-Sox5 and Sox6, act cooperatively with Sox9 to activate chondrocyte differentiation (1Lefebvre V. Behringer R.R. de Crombrugghe B. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2001; 9: 69-75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The Hox genes, msx-1 and msx-2, are required for skeletal patterning and morphogenesis (14Carlson M.R. Bryant S.V. Gardiner D.M. J. Exp.

Nkx3.2, a member of the NK class of homeoproteins, has most recently been demonstrated to function as a transcriptional repressor that promotes somite chondrogenesis (17Kim D.W. Kempf H. Chen R.E.

Although many of the extracellular ligands and nuclear transcription factors responsible for embryonic cartilage differentiation have been documented, comparatively little is known about the cytoplasmic protein kinase cascades that relay cell surface signals to the internal gene regulators. Protein kinase A activity may positively regulate chondrogenesis by promoting cartilage nodule formation (18Yoon Y.M. Oh C.D. Kang S.S. Chun J.S. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 2197-2205Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and protein kinase C expression is up-regulated during in vitro chondrogenesis (19Choi B. Chun J.S. Lee Y.S. Sonn J.K. Kang S.S.

In addition, the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases have been recently implicated as important intracellular mediators of embryonic chondrocyte differentiation. bone morphogenetic protein extracellular signal-regulated kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase constitutively active human MEK1 catalytically inactive human MEK1 glycosaminoglycan(s) fetal bovine serum glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cytomegalovirus. The ERK pathway, also known as the MEK-ERK kinase cascade, is one of the preeminent cytoplasmic signal transduction pathways governing the proliferation, survival, and differentiation of eukaryotic cells (21Chang F. Steelman L.S. Shelton J.G. Lee J.T. Navolanic P.M. Blalock W.L. Franklin R. McCubrey J.A. Int. J. Oncol. 2003; 22: 469-480PubMed Google Scholar, 22Johnson G.L. Lapadat R. Science. 2002; 298: 1911-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (3542) Google Scholar). The MEK-ERK cascade consists of three serially phosphorylating protein kinases (Raf, MEK, and ERK) that typically function downstream of cell surface receptors for growth factors and mitogens. These G-protein-coupled receptors recruit, via GDP/GTP exchange factors and adapter proteins, the small guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase), Ras. Ras activates the Raf family of serine threonine kinases (A-Raf, B-Raf, or c-Raf1). The Raf kinases, in turn, activate MEK1 and MEK2. MEK1 and -2 activate ERK1 and ERK2, their only known downstream substrates, by dual phosphorylation at their TEY motif (23Hilger R.A. Scheulen M.E. Strumberg D. Onkologie. 2002; 25: 511-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). ERK phosphorylation results in dissociation from its cytoplasmic anchor MEK, nuclear translocation, and subsequent phosphorylation of various transcription factors, including Elk-1, Rsk, ERF, c-Myc, and Cbfa1 (24Adachi M. Fukuda M. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5347-5358Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 25Weinstein-Oppenheimer C.R. Blalock W.L. Steelman L.S. Chang F. McCubrey J.A. Pharmacol.

Recently, the MEK-ERK kinase cascade has been implicated in the process of embryonic cartilage differentiation; however, its precise role remains controversial. Murakami et al. (7Murakami S. Kan M. McKeehan W.L. de Crombrugghe B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1113-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) interpreted the MEK-ERK cascade as a positive regulator of chondrogenesis, since, in cultured costal chondrocytes, the pharmacological MEK inhibitor U0126 diminished fibroblast growth factor 2-induced increases in Sox9 protein levels. In addition, transfection of a constitutively active MEK1 mutant up-regulated activity of a Sox9-dependent collagen II enhancer in both costal chondrocytes and C3H10T1/2 cells, a pluripotent mesenchymal progenitor cell line (7Murakami S. Kan M. McKeehan W.L. de Crombrugghe B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1113-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). In contrast, other studies describe the MEK-ERK kinase cascade as a negative modulator of cartilage differentiation. Endogenous ERK activity was observed to decrease during spontaneous chondrogenesis in micromass cultures of embryonic chick limb mesenchyme cells (27Chang S.H. Oh C.D. Yang M.S. Kang S.S. Lee Y.S. Sonn J.K. Chun J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19213-19219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and epidermal growth factor-induced inhibition of in vitro chondrogenesis coincided with increased ERK1 phosphorylation (8Yoon Y.M. Oh C.D. Kim D.Y. Lee Y.S. Park J.W. Huh T.L. Kang S.S. Chun J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12353-12359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the MEK inhibitor PD98059 was reported to enhance cartilage matrix formation in limb mesenchyme micromass cultures as evidenced by collagen II immunostaining and Alcian blue histochemistry (27Chang S.H.

(29Seghatoleslami M.R. Roman-Blas J.A. Rainville A.M. Modaressi R. Danielson K.G. Tuan R.S. J. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 88: 1129-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) reported that PD98059 elevates type II collagen and sox9 gene transcript levels in C3H10T1/2 cells, as determined by semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis. The present study was performed to better define the role of the MEK-ERK kinase cascade in chondrogenic differentiation of embryonic limb mesenchyme cells. To more thoroughly examine the effects of MEK inhibition on chondrogenesis, micromass cultures of prechondrogenic limb mesenchyme were treated with two different pharmacological MEK inhibitors, U0126 and PD98059. The effects of the two MEK inhibitors on expression of the cartilage-specific marker genes, type II collagen, aggrecan, and sox9, were compared utilizing RNA dot blot analysis. Effects on cartilage matrix proteoglycan synthesis and secretion were examined by measurement of radioactive 35SO4 uptake into sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAG) and by histochemical staining. Immunocytochemical staining was used to examine the effects of the pharmacological MEK inhibitors on type II collagen production. To directly analyze the effects of increased MEK activity on in vitro chondrogenesis, micromass cultures of prechondrogenic limb mesenchyme cells were transfected with a constitutively active MEK expression plasmid. Our results support the hypothesis that the MEK-ERK kinase cascade functions as an inhibitory modulator of chondrocyte differentiation in embryonic limb mesenchyme cells. However, some differences in the responses of the prechondrogenic cells to U0126 and PD98059 treatments suggest that the two putative MEK inhibitors do not have completely equivalent target specificities. Preparation of Micromass Cultures—High density micromass cultures of embryonic chick limb mesenchyme were established as previously described (13Kulyk W.M. Franklin J.L. Hoffman L.M. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 255: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 30Kulyk W.M. Dev. Biol. 1991; 146: 38-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Briefly, mesenchyme tissue was isolated from whole wing buds of stage 23/24 (31Hamburger V. Hamilton H.L. J. Morphol. 1951; 88: 49-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (10048) Google Scholar) chick embryos or from the distal tips of stage 24/25 chick embryo wing buds (32Gay S.W. Kosher R.A. J. Exp. Zool. 1984; 232: 317-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). After 25 min in 0.25% trypsin, the mesenchyme was dissociated into a single cell suspension at a density of 1–2 × 107 cells/ml, and 10-μl drops of cell suspension were spotted onto tissue culture dishes. Unless otherwise stated, a single 10-μl drop of cell suspension was spotted onto each 15-mm diameter well of either 4-well or 24-well NUNC tissue culture dishes. After spotting, the dishes were preincubated for 90 min at 37 °C to permit cell attachment. The cultures were then fed with F-12/10% FBS medium (Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, and antibiotics) and incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 plus 95% air atmosphere for up to 3 days without further medium change. Following incubation, cultures were processed for Alcian blue staining, type II collagen immunostaining, Western blotting, RNA dot blot analysis, or measurement of sulfated GAG synthesis. Pharmacological MEK inhibitors—F-12/10% FBS culture medium was supplemented with U0126 or PD98059 (Calbiochem) at 20 μm final concentrations. Unless otherwise stated, the MEK inhibitors were added to the culture medium at the time of initial feeding as concentrated stock solutions dissolved in Me2SO. Control cultures were supplemented with Me2SO vehicle alone (0.1% final concentration). Histochemistry and Immunostaining—To demonstrate sulfated cartilage matrix proteoglycan accumulation, representative cultures were collected after 3 days of incubation and stained with 0.5% Alcian blue 8GX, pH 1.0, as described (33Hassell J.R. Horigan E.A. Teratog. Carcinog. Mutagen. 1982; 2: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Alcian blue dye bound to matrix proteoglycans was extracted with 4 m guanidine hydrochloride and quantified by measuring absorbance at 600 nm (27Chang S.H. Oh C.D. Yang M.S. Kang S.S. Lee Y.S. Sonn J.K. Chun J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19213-19219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). To demonstrate type II collagen deposition, cultures were fixed for 30 min in 95% ethanol containing 2% acetic acid, incubated overnight in 70% ethanol, and then rehydrated and postfixed for 1 h in 4% paraformaldehyde. Cultures were subsequently incubated for 1 h with a 1:50 dilution of hybridoma supernatant containing chicken collagen II monoclonal antibody II-II6B3 (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa), washed, and incubated for 1 h with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (antibody A-1293 at 1:250 dilution; Sigma). Color development was performed using nitro blue tetrazolium chloride (0.34 mg/ml) and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate (0.175 mg/ml) dissolved in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.5, 50 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.05% levamisole. Western Blot Analysis—For Western blot analysis, cultures were established on 35-mm NUNC tissue culture dishes (eight 10-μl micromass spot cultures per dish). Denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and protein transfer to nitrocellulose were performed using the Bio-Rad Protean II Minigel apparatus according to a standard protocol. Micromass cultures from a single plate were homogenized in lysis buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma). Proteins were separated on 10% polyacrylamide containing 0.1% SDS. ERK was detected using polyclonal antibody sc-94 against total ERK1/2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and monoclonal antibody 9101S against dual phosphorylated ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling Technology). Primary antibodies were detected using appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad) and the Western blot Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as per the manufacturer's instructions. RNA Dot Blot Analysis—For RNA analysis, cultures were established on 35-mm NUNC tissue culture dishes (usually 4–8 10-μl micromass spot cultures/dish). Total RNA was isolated from the micromass cultures on each plate using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) as previously described (34Hoffman L.M. Kulyk W.M. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1999; 43: 167-174PubMed Google Scholar). The relative RNA contents of each sample were determined by RiboGreen (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) fluorescence assay according to the manufacturer's protocol. Equal aliquots of total RNA were spotted onto nitrocellulose (MSI Nitroplus) using a 96-well BioDot apparatus (Bio-Rad). Membranes were then hybridized with single-stranded cDNA probes specific for chicken sox9, aggrecan, and type II collagen (col2α1) mRNAs or with an oligonucleotide probe for the chicken glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene transcript. All cDNA probes were labeled to high specific activity with [32P]dCTP following the method of Konat (35Konat G.W. Scanning Microsc. Suppl. 1996; 10: 57-60PubMed Google Scholar); the GAPDH oligonucleotide was 5′-end-labeled with 32P using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Hybridization and washes were performed at high stringency as previously described (13Kulyk W.M. Franklin J.L. Hoffman L.M. Exp.

The specificities of all probes under the hybridization condition employed were established in earlier studies (13Kulyk W.M. Franklin J.L. Hoffman L.M. Exp.

Franklin J.L. Hoffman L.M. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 255: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The cDNA probes for chicken col2α1 and aggrecan were pCAR2 (38Vuorio E. Sandell L. Kravis D. Sheffield V.C. Vuorio T. Dorfman A. Upholt W.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 1175-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and ST-1 (39Sai S. Tanaka T. Kosher R.A. Tanzer M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5081-5085Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Hybridization signals for all probes were quantified by densitometric measurements on properly exposed autoradiographs using a Tecan SLT Spectra II spectrophotometric plate reader. To correct for slight variations in sample loading, hybridization signals for cartilage-specific mRNAs were normalized against signals for the constitutively expressed GAPDH transcript. Analysis of sulfated GAG Accumulation—F-12/10% FBS culture medium was supplemented with 5 μCi/ml [35S]H2SO4 (carrier-free; PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and the cells were continuously labeled over a 3-day incubation period. Sulfated GAG was isolated from both the cell layer and the medium fractions of the cultures by precipitation with cetylpyridinium chloride as previously described (30Kulyk W.M. Dev. Biol. 1991; 146: 38-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 40Kosher R.A. Dev. Biol. 1976; 53: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). GAG-incorporated label was quantified by liquid scintillation counting and normalized against the DNA content of each culture as determined by the Hoechst 33258 fluorescence assay (41Labarca C. Paigen K. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 102: 344-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (4553) Google Scholar). Transfection of Micromass Cultures—Prechondrogenic mesenchyme cells isolated from whole stage 23/24 wing buds or the distal tips of stage 24/25 chick embryo limb buds were suspended at a density of 2 × 107 cells/ml in F-12/5% FBS medium. The cells were transiently transfected with plasmid DNA using Lipofectin reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 0.75 μg of MEK expression vector, 0.75 μg of collagen II enhancer-firefly luciferase reporter plasmid, and 0.0375 μg of CMV-Renilla luciferase construct were combined in 100 μl of Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen) and then added to an equal volume of Lipofectin/Opti-MEM (6:100) mixture. For transfection purposes, 100 μl of mesenchymal suspension (2 × 106 cells) was combined 2:1 (v/v) with the Lipofectin-DNA complex. Following a 5-min incubation at room temperature, 15-μl spots of cell suspension (2 × 105 cells/spot) were plated onto 4-well NUNC culture dishes (1 spot/well). After 60 min at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 plus 95% air incubator, the cultures were flooded with F-12/5% FBS medium lacking antibiotics. Six hours later, the culture medium was replaced with F-12/5% FBS containing antibiotics. The cultures were incubated for a total of 2 days and then collected for determination of firefly luciferase and Renilla luciferase activities using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) following the manufacturer's protocol. Luciferase measurements were performed on cells from each individual culture well, with a minimum of eight replicates per treatment group. Measurements were performed on a Turner Designs TD20/20 luminometer. To correct for variations in transfection efficiency, activities of the collagen II enhancer-firefly luciferase reporter gene were normalized against activity of the co-transfected CMV-Renilla luciferase construct. MEK expression vectors under the control of the CMV promoter were generously provided by Natalie Ahn (University of Colorado, Boulder, CO). The plasmid encoding constitutively active human MEK1 (CA-MEK1) was construct hMKK1-N3/S218E/S222D (42Mansour S.J. Candia J.M. Gloor K.K. Ahn N.G. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 243-250PubMed Google Scholar). The catalytically inactive MEK1 vector (CI-MEK1) was plasmid hMKK1-K97M (43Mansour S.J. Candia J.M. Matsuura J.E. Manning M.C. Ahn N.G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15529-15536Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The corresponding empty vector was pCEP4L (42Mansour S.J. Candia J.M. Gloor K.K. Ahn N.G. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 243-250PubMed Google Scholar). The collagen II enhancer-firefly luciferase reporter was provided by T. Michael Underhill (University of Western Ontario) and contained four repeats of the 48-bp Sox9-responsive enhancer sequence of the mouse col2α1 gene (44Weston A.D. Chandraratna R.A. Torchia J. Underhill T.M. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) cloned in vector pGL3. The CMV-Renilla luciferase plasmid (pRL-CMV) was purchased from Promega. To test the effects of U0126 and PD98059 on collagen II enhancer activity, cells were transfected with the collagen II enhancer-firefly luciferase reporter plasmid alone. The MEK inhibitors were added to the cultures at the time of antibiotic addition (7 h after initial plating; see above). Luciferase activity was normalized against total cellular DNA as determined by a fluorescence assay (41Labarca C. Paigen K. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 102: 344-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (4553) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Quantitative data pertaining to Alcian blue staining, mRNA expression, sulfated GAG accumulation, and luciferase activity were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance with either Dunnett or Tukey multiple comparison post-tests (GraphPad Prism 4 software). Effects of the MEK Inhibitors, U0126 and PD98059, on Alcian Blue-stainable Matrix Proteoglycan Accumulation—We first examined the effects of the two putative MEK inhibitors, U0126 and PD98059, on the accumulation of histochemically identifiable cartilage matrix proteoglycans. Micromass cultures prepared from whole stage 23/24 chick embryo wing buds or from the distal mesenchyme of stage 24/25 wing buds were stained with Alcian blue dye following 3 days of incubation in medium supplemented with 20 μm U0126, 20 μm PD98059, or 0.1% Me2SO vehicle alone (controls). Cultures of stage 23/24 whole limb mesenchyme (Fig. 1, upper row) form numerous discrete Alcian blue-positive cartilage nodules separated by areas of unstained tissue, due to the presence of both chondrogenic and myogenic progenitor cells. In these whole limb mesenchyme cultures, PD98059 treatment stimulated a visible increase in Alcian blue-positive matrix accumulation relative to untreated control cultures (Fig. 1), while U0126 treatment caused no discernible increase. Quantitation of the histochemical staining confirmed that PD98059 increased Alcian blue-positive matrix proteoglycan deposition ∼1.9-fold over untreated control cultures (p < 0.001; n = 4), whereas U0126 treatment had no significant effect on Alcian blue-stainable cartilage matrix production (p > 0.05; n = 4). Micromass cultures of stage 24/25 distal limb mesenchyme (Fig. 1, lower row) contain a more uniform population of prechondrogenic cells that is uncontaminated by myoblast precursors. As such, their pa"

However, an involvement of nitric oxide (NO)-induced phosphorylation of c-Jun on Ser-63 and Ser-73 in apoptosis has not been explored. We report that in SH-Sy5y neuroblastoma cells, NO induced apoptosis following JNK activation and phosphorylation of c-Jun almost exclusively on Ser-63. Importantly, NO-induced apoptosis and caspase-3 activity were inhibited in cells stably transformed with dominant-negative c-Jun in which Ser-63 is mutated to alanine (S63A), but not in cells transformed with dominant-negative c-Jun (S73A). Ser-63 of c-Jun (but not Ser-73) was required for NO-induced, c-Jun-dependent transcriptional activity. NO-induced apoptosis, Ser-63 phosphorylation of c-Jun, and caspase-3 activity were all inhibited in SH-Sy5y cells transformed with dominant-negative jnk. A caspase-3 inhibitor prevented apoptosis but not c-Jun phosphorylation. In a different neuroblastoma cell line, NO-induced Ser-63 phosphorylation of c-Jun and apoptosis were blocked by a specific JNK inhibitor. We conclude that NO-inducible apoptosis is mediated by JNK-dependent Ser-63 phosphorylation of c-Jun upstream of caspase-3 activation in neuroblastoma cells. c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases (JNKs) potentiate transcriptional activity of c-Jun by phosphorylating serines 63 and 73.

There is much evidence that excessive NO generation during strokes, ischemia, or neurodegenerative diseases contributes to neuronal cell death (4Coyle J.T. Puttfarcken P.

Rev. 1999; 30: 153-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). NO can exert its cytotoxic effects in diverse cell types via generation of highly reactive free radicals such as peroxynitrite, which damages DNA, proteins, and lipids by oxidation (3Lipton S.A. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 943-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 6Kroncke K.D. Fehsel K. Kolb-Bachofen V.

Such damage in turn triggers downstream signal transduction pathways, which lead to apoptosis or necrosis (6Kroncke K.D. Fehsel K. Kolb-Bachofen V. Nitric Oxide. 1997; 1: 107-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). However, the death pathways that are activated in neurons in response to massive NO production are not well understood. Because NO can stimulate the activity of the transcription factor AP-1 in neurons (8Bogdan C. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 66-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 9Haby C. Lisovoski F. Aunis D. Zwiller J. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 496-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), one such death pathway might involve the AP-1-dependent regulation of cell death or survival genes.c-Jun, a prominent member of the AP-1 transcriptional factor family, has been implicated in the regulation of a wide range of biological processes including apoptosis, which it can promote or counteract, depending on the tissue, the developmental stage and the nature of the death stimulus (10Leppa S. Bohmann D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6158-6162Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 11Shaulian E. Karin M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E131-E136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2164) Google Scholar). Its transcriptional activities are regulated by changes in the level of c-jun expression as well as post-translational modifications of the c-Jun protein. In particular, phosphorylation of Ser-63 and Ser-73 in the NH2-terminal transactivation domain of c-Jun, which is mediated primarily by the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases (JNKs) (12Morton S. Davis R.J. McLaren A. Cohen P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3876-3886Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), substantially enhances the activity of c-Jun as a transcriptional factor (13Pulverer B.J. Kyriakis J.M.

Nature. 1991; 354: 494-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). c-Jun NH2-terminal phosphorylation on Ser-63 and Ser-73 can be either pro- or antiapoptotic (15Behrens A. Sibilia M. Wagner E.F. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 326-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar, 16Wisdom R. Johnson R.S. Moore C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 188-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). c-Jun phosphorylation is thought to be required for the antiapoptotic function of c-Jun during hepatogenesis (17Ganiatsas S.

The precise role of c-Jun phosphorylation in genotoxin-induced apoptosis (UV irradiation, DNA-damaging agents) is controversial, but c-Jun phosphorylation is proapoptotic in neurons subjected to kainate, a low potassium concentration, or nerve growth factor deprivation (15Behrens A.

Bim, Hrk, and Fas ligand are among the proteins whose up-regulation upon neurotrophin withdrawal is transcriptionally controlled, at least in part, by c-Jun phosphorylation (19Le Niculescu H.

Two previous reports suggested that NO activates p38 MAP kinase, triggering significant apoptosis in neuronal cells (27Cheng A. Chan S.L. Milhavet O. Wang S. Mattson M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43320-43327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 28Ghatan S. Larner S. Kinoshita Y. Hetman M. Patel L. Xia Z. Youle R.J. Morrison R.S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 335-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). JNK-mediated c-Jun phosphorylation is important for apoptosis of starved neuronal cells (19Le Niculescu H. Bonfoco E. Kasuya Y. Claret F.X. Green D.R. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 751-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar), and the JNK3 isoform is required for kainate-induced cytotoxicity in the central nervous system (29Yang D.D. Kuan C.Y. Whitmarsh A.J. Rincon M. Zheng T.S. Davis R.J. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Nature. 1997; 389: 865-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar). Mouse fibroblasts derived from jnk1–/– jnk2–/– double knock-out embryos that lack all JNK activity are less sensitive to apoptosis induced by UV irradiation. The brains of these embryos exhibit altered morphologies because of deregulated apoptosis, which surprisingly is increased in some brain regions but decreased in others (30Kuan C.Y. Yang D.D. Samanta Roy D.R. Davis R.J. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Neuron. 1999; 22: 667-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar). Thus, much evidence suggests that c-Jun phosphorylation is often but not always proapoptotic, particularly in neuronal cells.We reported recently that in SH-Sy5y cells, the constitutive activity of c-Jun/AP-1 in the absence of detectable AP-1 DNA binding is required for the expression of the neural cell adhesion molecule NCAM-140 (31Feng Z. Li L. Ng P.Y. Porter A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5357-5366Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This basal c-Jun/AP-1-dependent synthesis of NCAM-140 counteracts NO-induced apoptosis. Here, we investigated whether NO induces c-Jun phosphorylation and regulates apoptosis through the JNK-c-Jun pathway, as do other cellular stressors. Notably, we found that JNK-dependent phosphorylation of c-Jun on Ser-63 promotes NO-induced apoptosis of neuroblastoma cells. A speculative model is proposed which can account for the pro- and antiapoptotic action of c-Jun/AP-1 within a single neuroblastoma cell.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials and Plasmid Constructions—The human neuroblastoma cell lines SH-Sy5y and SHEP were obtained from Eva Feldman (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor) and from Evelyne Goillot (Laboratoire d'Immunologie, Centre Leon Berard, Lyon, France), respectively. The polyclonal antibodies against phospho-c-Jun, phospho-JNK, c-Jun, and JNK were from Cell Signaling Technology. The antibody against actin was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. DEVD-afc and z-DEVD-fmk were obtained from BACHEM. Lipofectin and Opti-MEM were purchased from Invitrogen. The cell proliferation reagent WST-1 was purchased from Roche Applied Science. The D-TAT and D-JNKI1 peptides were from Alexis Biochemicals (Switzerland). The dual luciferase assay kit and β-galactosidase assay kit were from Promega. All the other reagents used in this research were from Sigma.The plasmid encoding dominant-negative c-Jun (denoted JunAA) was obtained from Dan Mercola (Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center, San Diego). The plasmids bearing the dominant-negative S63A or S73A mutations in c-Jun were constructed by PCR-based mutagenesis based on the plasmid JunAA. The primers used were: S63A (forward), 5′-GCT CAA GCT GGC GTC TCC CGA GCT GG-3′; S63A (reverse), 5′-CCA GCT CGG GAG ACG CCA GCT TGA GC-3′; S73A (forward,) 5′-CCT CCT CAC CTC TCC CGA CG-3′; S73A (reverse), 5′-CGT CGG GAG AGG TGA GGA GG-3′, respectively. The Gal4-c-Jun transactivator and Gal4-luciferase reporter plasmids were purchased from Stratagene. The modified Gal4-c-Jun plasmids (S63A or S73A) were constructed by cloning the transactivation domain of c-Jun (amino acids 1–221) bearing either the S63A or S73A mutations into the pFA-CMV vector from Stratagene. The pGL3-AP1 reporter plasmid and RPL-TK plasmid were kindly provided by S. Dhakshinamoorthy (Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, Singapore). The plasmid encoding dominant-negative (DN)-JNK1 was provided by Roger J. Davis (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester), and the plasmid encoding DN-JNK2 was provided by Dr. Shengcai Lin (Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, Singapore).Cell Culture and Transfection—Both SH-Sy5y and SHEP cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The substrate that ensures cell plating is presumed to be extracellular matrix proteins, either exogenous or derived from the bovine serum. Normally the cells were split after 48 h in culture. The JunAA, S63A, S73A, DN-jnk1, and DN-jnk2, plasmids were transfected into SH-Sy5y cells using Lipofectin following the manufacturer's instructions. The stably transfected cells were selected and maintained in medium with 100 μg/ml hygromycin (JunAA, S63A, S73A), 500 μg/ml G418 (DN-jnk1), and 100 μg/ml zeosin (DN-jnk2).Reporter Assays—For the Gal4-c-Jun reporter assay, 50 ng of Gal4-c-Jun activator plasmids (wild type, S63A, S73A, or JunAA), 1 μg of Gal4-luciferase reporter plasmid, and 10 ng of β-galactosidase plasmid were cotransfected into SH-Sy5y cells in 6-well plates (1–2 × 105 cells/plate). 40 h later, cells were treated with 2 mm SNP for the indicated times. Medium was removed, and cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were harvested with 400 μl of reporter lysis buffer (provided in the β-galactosidase assay kit) and subjected to a short spin. 20 μl of supernatant was added to 100 μl of luciferase substrate, and the luciferase activity was measured immediately in a TD-20e luminometer. An aliquot of the same sample was used to determine β-galactosidase activity for normalizing luciferase activity obtained above. For the AP-1 reporter assay, 1 μg of pGL3-AP1 reporter plasmid and 10 ng of RPL-TK plasmid were cotransfected in S63A or S73A or vector control cells in 6-well plates. 40 h later, cells were treated with 2 mm SNP for the indicated times and harvested as described above. Lysates were diluted 10 times, and firefly luciferase activity was measured by adding 10 μl of diluted lysate and 100 μl of firefly luciferase substrate. The Renilla luciferase activity, as internal control, was measured by adding Stop&Glo solution in the same tube.Cell Death Assays—To measure cell death by WST-1 or lactate dehydrogenase release assay, cells (1–2 × 104/well) were plated in 96-well plates and treated with SNP for up to 15 h. WST-1 was added to the culture medium at a 1:10 dilution and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h or until the color of the medium turned red (incubation time can vary according to the cell number in the culture). The absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 420 nm. To carry out the lactate dehydrogenase release assay, the supernatants of the cells were collected, and the cell layer was lysed with an equal volume of lysis buffer (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 0.1% Triton X-100). Lactate dehydrogenase activity in the supernatant and the lysate was quantitated. The cytotoxicity was calculated as percentage of lactate dehydrogenase release by the ratio of supernatant/(lysate + supernatant).Caspase Activity Assay—The activity of caspase-3-like proteases was measured using microtiter plates as described previously (28Ghatan S. Larner S. Kinoshita Y. Hetman M. Patel L. Xia Z. Youle R.J. Morrison R.S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 335-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 32Hentze H. Schmitz I. Latta M. Krueger A.

After SNP treatment, the cells were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 μg/ml each pepstatin, leupeptin, and aprotinin), and the lysate was stored at –80 °C. The samples were diluted 1:10 with reaction buffer (60 μm fluorogenic substrate DEVD-afc in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1% sucrose, 0.1% CHAPS, 10 mm dithiothreitol) in a final volume of 100 μl and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Released afc was measured kinetically with a fluorescent spectrophotometer set at excitation wavelength of 400 nm and emission wavelength of 505 nm. For normalization, protein concentrations of the corresponding samples were estimated simultaneously by using the BCA reagents from Pierce Chemical Company. 1 microunit/mg corresponds to 1 (μmol/mg) × min.Western Blot Analysis—105 cells were lysed in 200 μl of SDS sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 50 mm freshly added dithiothreitol). Sonication was needed to shear the genomic DNA and reduce the viscosity of the lysate. The sonicated lysate was then heated at 99 °C for 5 min and subjected to centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. 50 μl of the supernatants was separated on 0.1% SDS and 12% polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). Detection of bands was performed using the Phototope®-horseradish peroxidase Western Blot Detection System (Cell Signaling).Peptide Inhibition Assay—The inhibition assay was carried out in SHEP neuroblastoma cells. D-TAT and D-JNKI1 peptides were added at final concentrations of 20, 50, and 100 μm into the medium. After 24 h, the medium was refreshed with peptides, and SNP was added at a final concentration of 2 mm. At various times thereafter, cell death and c-Jun phosphorylation were measured as described above.RESULTSNO Induces JNK Activation, c-Jun Phosphorylation on Ser-63, and Apoptosis in SH-Sy5y Cells—Various NO donors have been used widely to study oxidative stress and cellular responses by mimicking endogenous NO generation (33Brune B. von Knethen A. Sandau K.B. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 969-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). SH-Sy5y neuroblastoma cells are highly sensitive to cell death induced by various NO donors including SNP at concentrations in the range 0.5–2.5 mm, and the mode of cell death under these conditions is apoptosis (28Ghatan S. Larner S. Kinoshita Y. Hetman M. Patel L. Xia Z. Youle R.J. Morrison R.S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 335-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 31Feng Z. Li L. Ng P.Y. Porter A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5357-5366Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 34Oh-Hashi K. Maruyama W. Yi H. Takahashi T. Naoi M. Isobe K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 504-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). As described previously (31Feng Z. Li L. Ng P.Y. Porter A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5357-5366Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), a time-dependent increase in cell death was observed beginning around 8 h after the addition of SNP to the SH-Sy5y cells (Fig. 1A), and this increase correlated with the appearance of significant JNK activity at 6–7.5 h after the addition of SNP (Fig. 1B, upper panel).Because JNKs are the main upstream kinases for c-Jun NH2-terminal phosphorylation (12Morton S. Davis R.J. McLaren A. Cohen P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3876-3886Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), we next tested whether the Ser-63 and Ser-73 residues of c-Jun were phosphorylated after SNP treatment of SH-Sy5y cells by using phosphoserine 63- and phosphoserine 73-specific antibodies. A strong and sustained c-Jun phosphorylation on Ser-63 was observed at 6–8 h after the addition of SNP, whereas phosphorylation on Ser-73 was virtually undetectable (Fig. 1C). In contrast, UV irradiation of SH-Sy5y cells resulted in similar levels of Ser-63 and Ser-73 phosphorylation (Fig. 1C). Thus, JNK activation and selective phosphorylation of c-Jun on Ser-63 both occurred around the onset of NO donor-induced apoptosis. Ser-63 phosphorylation and the death of SH-Sy5y cells both occurred at 1.5 and 2 mm SNP. Concentrations of SNP lower than 1.5 mm neither induced cell death nor elicited Ser-63 phosphorylation of c-Jun (data not shown), indicating that c-Jun is phosphorylated only at toxic concentrations of SNP. Excessive concentrations of SNP higher than 2.5 mm resulted in detectable Ser-73 phosphorylation that closely correlated with the onset of appreciable necrosis, indicating that predominant Ser-63 phosphorylation is an apoptosis-related phenomenon (data not shown).NO-induced Apoptosis Is Blocked in S63A and JunAA Stable Cells but Not in S73A Stable Cells—To investigate whether c-Jun phosphorylation contributes to NO-induced apoptosis, we stably transfected SH-Sy5y cells with plasmids encoding various dominant-negative forms of c-Jun. In one form, Ser-63 was mutated to alanine (denoted S63A), and in another Ser-73 was mutated to alanine (denoted S73A). In a third form, both Ser-63 and Ser-73 were mutated to alanines (JunAA), which compromises the ability of c-Jun to transactivate target genes (15Behrens A. Sibilia M. Wagner E.F. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 326-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar).To exclude the possibility that highly overexpressed S63A, S73A, or JunAA might quench JNK activity by sequestering JNK in an abortive complex, we chose for further analysis independent clones in which S63A (Fig. 2A, top panel) or JunAA (Fig. 2A, lower panel) or S73A (data not shown) are expressed at levels only slightly in excess of endogenous c-Jun. Normal phosphorylation of endogenous c-Jun on Ser-63 in response to UV irradiation was still observed in two independent clones of S63A stable cells (Fig. 2B); and as expected, the endogenous Ser-73 phosphorylation of c-Jun in response to UV irradiation was more intense in S63A stable cells compared with the vector control cells (Fig. 2C). Analogous results were obtained in UV irradiation-treated S73A cells (data not shown). In addition, NO-induced phosphorylation of endogenous c-Jun on Ser-63 still occurred in two independent JunAA clones (Fig. 2D). These data indicate that the expression of c-Jun mutated to S63A and/or S73A did not compromise endogenous JNK activity.Fig. 2Stable expression of S63A or JunAA does not inhibit endogenous c-Jun phosphorylation in SH-Sy5y cells.A, expression levels of the exogenous c-Jun proteins in the stable cell lines compared with vector control (V.C.). Upper panel, two clones of S63A. Lower panel, two clones of JunAA. B, two independent clones of S63A stable cell and the vector control cell were treated with 100 J/m2 UV irradiation, and the cells were harvested after 1 h. Total proteins in the cell lysates were fractionated on 0.1% SDS and 12% polyacrylamide gels and subjected to immunoblot analysis using an antibody against phosphoserine 63. C, two independent clones of S63A stable cell and the vector control cell line were treated with 100 J/m2 UV irradiation, and total proteins were prepared as in B for immunoblot analysis using an antibody against phosphoserine 73. D, two independent clones of JunAA stable cell and the vector control cell line were treated with 2 mm SNP for 10 h. Total proteins were prepared as in B for immunoblot analysis using an antibody against phosphoserine 63. Actin was visualized as a loading control in all three panels.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We then compared the sensitivities of the above three different stable cells and vector control cells to NO donors and UV radiation. At any concentrations of SNP which were sufficient to induce apoptosis, several independent clones of S63A and JunAA stable cells showed markedly increased resistance to cell death compared with vector control cells (Fig. 3A). Importantly, various S73A stable cell lines failed to show resistance to NO compared with vector control cells (Fig. 3A). In contrast, neither S63A nor S73A stable cells were resistant to UV irradiation-induced cell death, whereas JunAA cells only showed a marginal increase in resistance to UV irradiation (Fig. 3B). These data provide evidence that Ser-63 phosphorylation of c-Jun is important in NO-induced, but not UV irradiation-induced cell death.Fig. 3Stable expression of S63A and JunAA increases resistance of SH-Sy5y cells to NO.A, S63A, S73A, and JunAA stable cells and vector control (V.C.) cells were treated with SNP for 15 h at the different indicated concentrations. The percentage of dead cells was measured. Values are the mean ± S.D. determined from three independent clones of S63A, S73A, or JunAA, each in triplicate. B, S63A, S73A, and JunAA stable cells and vector control cells were treated with UV irradiation at the different indicated doses. After 24 h, the percentage of dead cells was measured. Values are the mean ± S.D. determined from three independent clones of S63A, S73A, or JunAA, each in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Ser-63 of c-Jun Is Required for c-Jun- and AP-1-mediated Transactivation in Response to NO—Dual phosphorylation of Ser-63 and Ser-73 has been found previously to lead to c-Jun-dependent transactivation (14Smeal T. Binetruy B. Mercola D.A. Birrer M. Karin M. Nature. 1991; 354: 494-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar), and accordingly mutation of both serines reduces the ability of c-Jun to transactivate target genes (15Behrens A. Sibilia M. Wagner E.F. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 326-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Because we found that NO caused c-Jun phosphorylation predominantly on Ser-63, and since S63A and JunAA stable cells showed markedly increased resistance to cell death, we next asked whether Ser-63 phosphorylation alone can potentiate c-Jun and AP-1 transactivation. Using a Gal4-c-Jun reporter system, we found that Gal4-c-Jun (wild type) as well as Gal4-c-Jun (S73A) were transactivated up to 4-fold in SH-Sy5y cells upon NO stimulation (Fig. 4A). However, Gal4-c-Jun (S63A) and Gal4-c-Jun (JunAA) were completely inactive in transactivation (Fig. 4A). In parallel experiments, transient transfections with AP-1 reporter plasmids revealed that NO-induced AP-1 activation of up to ∼2.7-fold occurred in SH-Sy5y and S73A cells but was absent in S63A cells (Fig. 4B). Thus, our combined data from the c-Jun and AP-1 reporter assays indicate that the presence of Ser-63 (but not Ser-73) is required for NO-induced c-Jun/AP-1 transactivation. These results also indicate that S63A and the JunAA constructs function as dominant-negatives by inhibiting gene transcription mediated by endogenous c-Jun.Fig. 4Ser-63 of c-Jun is required for c-Jun- and AP-1-mediated transactivation in response to NO.A, different Gal4-c-Jun constructs bearing the unmodified (WT) c-Jun sequence, or S63A, S73A, or JunAA mutations in the transactivation region of c-Jun, were cotransfected with a luciferase reporter plasmid together with β-galactosidase into SH-Sy5y cells. 40 h later, the cells were treated with 2 mm SNP for the indicated times and harvested. Luciferase activity was measured, and β-galactosidase activity was also measured as an internal control. B, the AP-1 reporter plasmid was cotransfected with the RPL-TK plasmid into S63A, S73A, and vector control (V-AA) stable cells. 40 h later, the cells were treated with 2 mm SNP for the indicated times and harvested.

We used human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) as a model system. We show that PAF activated pertussis toxin-insensitive Gαq protein upon binding to its seven transmembrane receptor. Elevated cAMP levels were observed via activation of adenylate cyclase, which activated protein kinase A (PKA) and was attenuated by a PAF receptor antagonist, blocking downstream activity. Phosphorylation of Src by PAF required Gαq protein and adenylate cyclase activation; there was an absolute requirement of PKA for PAF-induced Src phosphorylation. Immediate (1 min) PAF-induced STAT-3 phosphorylation required the activation of Gαq protein, adenylate cyclase, and PKA, and was independent of these intermediates at delayed (30 min) and prolonged (60 min) PAF exposure. PAF activated PLCβ3 through its Gαq protein-coupled receptor, whereas activation of phospholipase Cγ1 (PLCγ1) by PAF was independent of G proteins but required the involvement of Src at prolonged PAF exposure (60 min). We demonstrate for the first time in vascular endothelial cells: (i) the involvement of signaling intermediates in the PAF-PAF receptor system in the induction of TIMP2 and MT1-MMP expression, resulting in the coordinated proteolytic activation of MMP2, and (ii) a receptor-mediated signal transduction cascade for the tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK by PAF.

Zimmerman G.A. Stafforini D.M. McIntyre T.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 419-445Google Scholar). A wide variety of PAF bioactions have been elucidated, including platelet activation, embryogenesis, cell differentiation, and shock, inflammatory, and immune responses (2Ishii S. Shimizu T. Prog. Lipid. Res. 2000; 39: 41-82Google Scholar). PAF is so potent that it can always elicit significant biological responses at nanomolar concentrations in vitro and in vivo (3Snyder F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1254: 231-249Google Scholar). Many cells and organs have been shown to produce PAF, which can themselves become targets of PAF bioactions (2Ishii S. Shimizu T. Prog. Lipid. Res. 2000; 39: 41-82Google Scholar). PAF induces endothelial cell migration, which depends on a chemotactic rather than a chemokinetic effect, and promotes in vivo angiogenesis, thus acting as a mediator of vascularization for tumor growth and metastasis (4Montrucchio G.

PAF acts through its specific G protein-coupled receptor, found to be localized to the plasmalemma and a large endosomal compartment in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) (6Ihida K. Predescu D. Czekay R.P. Palade G.E. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 285-295Google Scholar). The PAF receptor contains seven α-helical domains that span the plasma membrane and relates the binding of PAF to an intracellular signal through the coupled G protein (7Ishii S. Nagase T. Shimizu T. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2002; 68 (–69): 599-609Google Scholar). Depending on the cell types, multiple G proteins interact with the PAF receptor resulting in a myriad of distinct signaling pathways. In leukocytes, chemotactic responses to PAF use the pertussis toxin-resistant G proteins (8Haribabu B. Zhelev D.V. Pridgen B.C. Richardson R.M. Ali H. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37087-37092Google Scholar), whereas in eosinophils, PAF signals through both pertussis toxin-sensitive and -resistant G proteins (9Kato M. Kimura H. Motegi Y. Tachibana A. Minakami H. Morikawa A. Kita H. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 5252-5259Google Scholar). Activation of the p38 MAPK by PAF in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells occurs through the pertussis toxin-insensitive Gαq protein, whereas the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 upon PAF stimulation in these cells signals through the α subunit of pertussis toxin-sensitive Go but not Gi protein (10van Biesen T.

The activation of adenylate cyclase and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A (PKA)) by the PAF-PAF receptor system regulates different effector functions depending on the cell type. Stimulation of adenylate cyclase leads to increased levels of cAMP in mesangial cells upon binding of PAF to its receptor, whereas in CHO cells, PAF stimulation antagonized adenylate cyclase activity, leading to decreased levels of cAMP (12Nakao A.

Shiomi T. Shimizu T. Yamaguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43025-43030Google Scholar). The PAF-induced activation of PKA leads to stimulation of the acrosome reaction in human spermatozoa, and causes generation of superoxide anions and degranulation in eosinophils (14Takizawa T.

Nishiwaki K. Ishikawa M. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 1996; 2: 401-404Google Scholar). One consequence of PAF receptor activation is the stimulation of specific isoenzymes of phospholipase C (PLC) depending on the cell type. Of the three classes of PLC, namely PLCβ, PLCγ, and PLCδ, PAF stimulates the phosphorylation and activation of only PLCβ and PLCγ (16Lee C.W. Park D.J. Lee K.H. Kim C.G. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21318-21327Google Scholar). Signaling to PLCβ isoenzymes occurs through either Gαq protein (17Park D.J. John D.Y. Lee C.W. Lee K.H. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4573-4576Google Scholar) or through the Gi protein using the βγ subunit (18Murthy K.S. Makhlouf G.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 1172-1179Google Scholar). There appears to be a requirement for the phosphorylation of a tyrosine residue on PLCγ to enable its activation (19Rhee S.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 297-301Google Scholar). In a B lymphoblastoid cell line, PAF induces an immediate phosphorylation of the tyrosine residue on PLCγ1 leading to its activation (20Kuruvilla A. Pielop C. Shearer W.T. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 5433-5442Google Scholar). Introduction of anti-Src antibodies into rat aortic smooth muscle cells attenuated tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ1 upon stimulation of the G protein-coupled angiotensin II receptor (21Marrero M.B. Schieffer B. Paxton W.G. Schieffer E. Bernstein K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15734-15738Google Scholar). Involvement of Src in the PAF-dependent PLCγ activation has also been demonstrated in platelets (22Dhar A. Shukla S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9123-9127Google Scholar). Among the various tyrosine kinases, focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is involved in the regulation of cellular motility, adhesion, and cytoskeletal assembly (23Schaller M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1540: 1-21Google Scholar). FAK has a molecular structure that is distinct from other identified tyrosine kinases. The catalytic domain is flanked on one side by the N terminus, which interacts with integrins and growth factor receptors (23Schaller M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1540: 1-21Google Scholar), and on the other side by the C terminus, which has binding sites for SH2 and SH3 domains that link FAK to the activation of various downstream signaling pathways (24Schlaepfer D.D. Hauck C.R. Sieg D.J. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 435-478Google Scholar). The unique terminal focal adhesion targeting sequence contains prolinerich sequences that serve as binding sites for paxillin, an adaptor protein (25Hildebrand J.D. Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 637-647Google Scholar), and the structural protein, talin (26Chen H.C. Appeddu P.A. Parsons J.T. Hildebrand J.D. Schaller M.D. Guan J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16995-16999Google Scholar). In rat cerebral cortex and hippocampus, binding of PAF to its receptor has been shown to stimulate a rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK (27Calcerrada M.C. Catalan R.E. Prerz-Alvarez M.J. Miguel B.G. Martinez A.M. Brain Res. 1999; 835: 275-281Google Scholar, 28Calcerrada M.C. Catalan R.E. Martinez A.M. Neurochem. Res. 2002; 27: 313-318Google Scholar). Thus, a variety of different signaling proteins directly associate with FAK, and this combination of proteins affects the involvement of FAK in diverse signaling pathways. Degradation of the matrix surrounding the interstitial space, occurs through the stringent regulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), including membrane type 1 MMP (MT1-MMP or MMP14) and MMP2 (29Itoh T. Tanioka M. Yoshida H. Yoshioka T. Nishimoto H. Itohara S. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1048-1051Google Scholar), and the action of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases, such as TIMP2 (30Morrison C.J. Butler G.S. Bigg H.F. Roberts C.R. Soloway P.D. Overall C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47402-47410Google Scholar), leading to cellular invasion. PAF has been shown to stimulate the expression and activity of MMPs in corneal epithelial cells (31Tao Y. Bazan H.E.P. Bazan N.G. Invest. Opthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1995; 36: 345-354Google Scholar). In neuroblastoma clones isolated from the human LaN1 neuroblastoma cell line, PAF exposure reduced the expression MMPs and activation of MMP2, resulting in inhibition of invasiveness through Matrigel by these cells (32Barletta E. Mugnai G. Ruggieri S. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 189-197Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated that the stimulation of quiescent HUVECs with PAF induces increases in mRNA levels for TIMP2 and MMP14, resulting in coordinated increases in protein levels of both TIMP2 and MT1-MMP (55Axelrad T.W. Deo D.D. Ottino P. Van Kirk J. Bazan N.G. Bazan H.E.P. Hunt J.D. FASEB J. 2004; 18 (in press)Google Scholar). PAF does not increase mRNA levels or protein levels of MMP2 but instead results in proteolytic activation of constitutively expressed pro-MMP2 to MMP2 through the coordinated activity of the extracellular membrane-bound heterotrimeric TIMP2·pro-MMP2·MT1-MMP complex. In this complex, TIMP2 binds to pro-MMP2, which is bound to the extracellular matrix. TIMP2 then associates with a membrane-bound MT1-MMP molecule, which positions the pro-MMP2 so that a second, membrane-bound MT1-MMP can cleave the pro-domain from pro-MMP2, releasing active MMP2 into the extracellular milieu. In the present report, we show that activation of the PAF receptor induces a specific receptor-associated pertussis toxin-insensitive Gαq protein in HUVECs. Stimulation of adenylate cyclase by PAF, resulting in increased levels of cAMP, induces the activation of PKA in HUVECs, which requires the activation of Gαq protein coupled to the PAF receptor. Phosphorylation of Src by PAF is attenuated by the PAF receptor antagonist LAU-8080 as well as upon blocking the activation of Gαq protein and adenylate cyclase; indeed, there is an absolute requirement for PKA activation in the PAF-PAF receptor signaling to Src. We have previously demonstrated that both Src and JAK-2 phosphorylate STAT-3 in HUVECs in a temporally regulated fashion (33Deo D.D. Axelrad T.W. Robert E.G. Marcheselli V. Bazan N.G. Hunt J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21237-21245Google Scholar). Here we show that the initial signal to STAT-3 through the PAF-PAF receptor signaling mechanism involves the activation of Gαq protein, adenylate cyclase, and PKA, whereas the delayed and prolonged phosphorylation of STAT-3 by PAF is independent of these signaling intermediates. This confirms our previous findings that delayed phosphorylation (30 min) of STAT-3 in HUVECs occurs through JAK-2 and that immediate phosphorylation (1 min) occurs via Src (33Deo D.D. Axelrad T.W. Robert E.G. Marcheselli V. Bazan N.G. Hunt J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21237-21245Google Scholar). Activation of the Gαq-protein-coupled PAF receptor by PAF also stimulates the early phosphorylation of PLCβ3 and does not involve Src, whereas there is no requirement of G proteins for the activation of PLCγ1 by the PAF-PAF receptor mechanism. The Src inhibitor PP1 attenuates the delayed activation of PLCγ1 by PAF suggesting the importance of Src in the PAF-mediated activation of PLCγ1. The Gαq-protein-coupled PAF-PAF receptor-signaling cascade also phosphorylates FAK in a time-dependent manner, and its activation is independent of the adenylate cyclase/PKA axis in HUVECs. Stimulation of the tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK by PAF-PAF receptor signaling cascade induces the binding of Src, p130Cas, SHC, and paxillin to FAK in HUVECs. Finally, PAF induces a time-dependent increase in expression of TIMP2 and MT1-MMP, which are dependent upon the activity of Gαq and Src, but has no effect on the level of pro-MMP2 in growth factor-starved HUVECs. However, the PAF-mediated increased TIMP2 and MT1-MMP levels, result in the proteolytic activation of pro-MMP2 to active MMP2 in the growth medium.

Pertussis toxin, GP Antagonist-2, GP Antagonist-2A, suramin, adenylate cyclase inhibitor SQ-22536, PKA inhibitor H-89, and Src family inhibitor PP1 were from BIOMOL Research Laboratories, whereas the JAK-2 inhibitor Tyrphostin AG-490 (T-9142) (Tyrphostin B42) was from LC Laboratories, Woburn, MA. Detection of cAMP was done using a Direct cAMP enzyme immunoassay kit from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO), and PKA activity was detected using the PKA assay kit from Upstate Biotechnology. FBS, endothelial growth medium (EGM-2), and endothelial basal medium (EBM-2) were from Cambrex (Walkersville, MD). Cell Culture—HUVECs were grown to sub-confluent levels in EGM-2 obtained from Cambrex, Inc. plated onto 6-well culture plates (1 × 106 cells/well). HUVECs were then washed once with EBM-2 and starved of growth factors by switching them to EBM-2 supplemented with 0.2% FBS (Cambrex) for 16 h. Cells were again washed once with EBM-2 and then exposed to various experimental conditions for different time points. At the end of each time point, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (Invitrogen), lysed in cell lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm NA3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 70 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1% v/v Triton X-100, 2% w/v SDS, and 1 μg/ml protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma-Aldrich). Cell lysates were used as indicated below. cAMP Assay—Activation of adenylate cyclase was assessed by estimating the levels of cAMP using the Direct cAMP enzyme immunoassay kit (Sigma-Aldrich). Briefly, HUVECs treated with various conditions for different time points were lysed using 0.1 m HCl for 10 min, centrifuged at 600 × g at room temperature, and the supernatant was used directly in the assay. All samples were acetylated with the acetylating reagent and aliquoted onto 96-well plate, neutralized with the neutralizing reagent and treated with cAMP conjugate and cAMP antibody. After incubating at room temperature for 2 h, the wells were aspirated and washed three times with the wash solution, followed by treatment with substrate and incubation for 1 h at room temperature. The reaction was stopped with the stop solution and read at 405 nm. PKA Activity Assay—Analysis of PKA activity was based on its ability to phosphorylate its specific substrate, Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly (Kemptide), using the PKA assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology). Briefly, HUVECs were treated for different time points with various experimental conditions and lysed with the lysis buffer. Cell lysate (200 μg) was added to a mixture of cAMP, Kemptide, protease inhibitor mixture and inhibitor peptide in the assay dilution buffer. The reaction was started by adding magnesium/ATP mixture containing [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity, 3448 cpm/pmol). After incubating for 10 min at 30 °C with constant shaking, samples were aliquoted onto P81 phosphocellulose squares and washed in 0.75% phosphoric acid to stop the reaction. Furthermore, the squares were washed in acetone, added to scintillation vials containing Ecolite (ECN, Costa Mesa, CA) and quantified on a Tri-Carb 2900TR Liquid Scintillation Counter (Packard, Meriden, CT). Cell Membrane Preparation—Total cell membranes were isolated by the method of Nagamatsu et al. (34Nagamatsu S. Kornhauser J.M. Burant C.F. Seino S. Mayo K.E. Bell G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 467-472Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline after each time point and homogenized in 1 ml of homogenization buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 200 mm sucrose, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The nuclei and cell debris were removed from the homogenate by centrifugation at 900 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 110,000 × g for 75 min at 4 °C (SW 50.1 rotor, Beckman ultracentrifuge). The membrane pellet was in solubilization buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for a minimum of 1 h at 4 °C. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and 1 μg/ml protease inhibitor mixture was added to the solubilized membrane samples. Western Blot Analysis—HUVECs, treated for 16 h in EBM-2 supplemented with 0.2% FBS, were pretreated for 30 min with 10 μm LAU-8080, 10 μm BN-52021, or 3 μm CV-3988, followed by exposure to 10-7m PAF for various time points. The inhibition of G proteins was achieved by a 30-min pretreatment with 60 μm suramin, 25 μm GP Antagonist-2, or 10 μm GP Antagonist-2A. Cells were treated with 1 μg/ml pertussis toxin overnight prior to PAF exposure. Adenylate cyclase and PKA activities were inhibited by treatment of HUVECs with 50 μm SQ-22536, 100 μm H-89 for 30 min, followed by 10-7m PAF exposure for various time points. JAK-2 and Src were inhibited by a 30-min pretreatment with 50 μm AG-490 and 170 nm PP1, respectively, followed by PAF exposure. After the completion of each time point, the cells were lysed in the cell lysis buffer containing 0.1% w/v bromphenol blue, or the growth medium was collected and concentrated using Centricon YM-10 centrifugal filter devices. The samples were boiled for 5 min, and separated using 7.5%, 10%, or 15% SDS-PAGE (40 μg of total protein/lane), respectively. The separated proteins were then transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, blocked with Tris-buffered saline containing 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with the antibodies against the phosphorylated proteins in Tris-buffered saline containing 5% nonfat dry milk and 0.5% Tween 20, overnight at 4 °C. After washing and incubation with the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, the phosphorylated proteins were revealed using the enhanced chemiluminescent detection kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Membranes were stripped by incubation in 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 10% w/v SDS, and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol for 30 min at 55 °C. After washing, membranes were blocked with blocking buffer and reprobed with antibodies against the non-phosphorylated proteins or tubulin, respectively, and developed as described above. Immunoprecipitation of FAK—HUVECs were preincubated with 10 μm LAU-8080 or 10 μm GP Antagonist-2A for 30 min and then exposed to 10-7m PAF for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were then lysed with the cell lysis buffer and were incubated with anti-FAK antibody at 4 °C overnight and precipitated by incubation with 100 μg of protein A-Agarose for 2 h at 4 °C. After washing three times with lysis buffer, complexes were dissolved in 1× loading buffer, separated using 7.5% SDS-PAGE, blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), incubated with antibodies against various FAK-binding proteins: anti-Src, anti-SHC, anti-p130Cas, anti-paxillin, anti-CAP antibodies, for 1 h at room temperature and detected using the chemiluminescent detection kit (Pierce). PAF Induces Activation of Pertussis Toxin-insensitive Gαq Protein—HUVECs were starved of growth factors overnight (EBM supplemented with 0.2% FBS), after which they were exposed to 1 μg/ml pertussis toxin (overnight), or for 30 min with 60 μm suramin, 25 μm GP Antagonist-2 (pertussis toxin-sensitive Gαi and Gαo protein inhibitor), or 10 μm GP Antagonist-2A (pertussis toxin-insensitive Gαq protein inhibitor). The cells were then stimulated with 0.1 μm PAF, and the level of Src phosphorylation was investigated over time (Fig. 1A). As seen in Fig. 1B pertussis toxin and GP Antagonist-2 do not affect the downstream activation of Src following stimulation of HUVECs with PAF, indicating that pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins are not involved in PAF signaling in HUVECs. In contrast, GP Antagonist-2A, which specifically inhibits pertussis toxin-insensitive Gαq protein, significantly reduced downstream phosphorylation of Src following stimulation of HUVECs with PAF. The inhibition observed with GP Antagonist-2A treatment exceeded the inhibition observed with the broad spectrum G protein inhibitor suramin. Adenylate Cyclase Is Activated by PAF through PAF Receptor and Gαq—We hypothesized that adenylate cyclase is induced in HUVECs following PAF receptor stimulation and activation of a specific G protein. To test this hypothesis, HUVECs were starved overnight by exposing them to basal medium devoid of growth factors and then exposed for various time points to PAF with or without PAF receptor antagonists LAU-8080, BN-52021, or CV-3988. Adenylate cyclase activity was analyzed by measuring the amount of cAMP produced in each condition. As seen in Fig. 2A cAMP levels were maximal at 10 min of PAF exposure. The PAF-stimulated cAMP production was attenuated at each time point by the PAF receptor antagonists alone or in combination with PAF, suggesting that PAF stimulates the activity of adenylate cyclase through the PAF receptor in HUVECs. Furthermore, growth factor-starved HUVECs were exposed to suramin, SQ-22536 (adenylate cyclase inhibitor), or pertussis toxin-sensitive or -insensitive G protein inhibitors for 30 min prior to PAF exposure over time Fig. 2B. Basal levels of cAMP were observed upon inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity by SQ-22536 with or without PAF in HUVECs. Pertussis toxin or GP Antagonist-2, which inhibit the pertussis toxin-sensitive Gαi or Gαo proteins, did not antagonize PAF-stimulated cAMP production. Decreased levels of cAMP were observed in the presence of the general G protein inhibitor suramin, which was not altered in the presence of PAF. Significant attenuation of cAMP levels were observed at the 10-min time point when the pertussis toxin-insensitive Gαq protein was specifically blocked by GP Antagonist-2A, and PAF stimulation could not alter this effect, suggesting that PAF activates adenylate cyclase through the involvement of PAF receptor and its associated Gαq protein. PKA Is Activated via the PAF-PAF Receptor-signaling Cascade—As seen in Fig. 3A, maximal stimulation of PKA activity by PAF occurred following 10 min of PAF exposure in growth factor-starved HUVECs; this effect was antagonized by each of PAF receptor antagonists at all time points, further supporting the involvement of PAF in PKA activation. Inhibition of PKA activity by H-89 (a specific PKA inhibitor) could not be recovered by the addition of PAF at any time point (Fig. 3B). Although PAF-stimulated PKA activity was unaffected upon blocking the pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins, atte"

For this purpose, green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged versions of these proteins were expressed in the myeloid cell line PLB-985. First, the correct localization of p67GFP and GFP-Rac2 was shown during phagocytosis of serum-treated zymosan by wild-type PLB-985 cells and PLB-985 X-CGD (chronic granulomatous disease) cells, which lack expression of flavocytochrome b558. Subsequently, these constructs were used for fluorescence recovery after photobleaching studies to elucidate the turnover of these proteins on the phagosomal membrane. The turnover of p67GFP and GFP-Rac2 proved to be very high, indicating a continuous exchange of flavocytochrome b558-bound p67GFP and GFP-Rac2 for cytosolic, free p67GFP and GFP-Rac2. Furthermore, the importance of an intact actin cytoskeleton for correct localization of these proteins was investigated by disrupting the actin cytoskeleton with cytochalasin B. However, cytochalasin B treatment of PLB-985 cells did not alter the localization of p67GFP and GFP-Rac2 once phagocytosis was initiated. In addition, the continuous exchange of flavocytochrome b558-bound p67GFP and GFP-Rac2 for cytosolic p67GFP and GFP-Rac2 was still intact in cytochalasin B-treated cells, indicating that the translocation of these proteins does not depend on a rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton. In this study, the translocation of the NADPH oxidase components p67phox and Rac2 was studied during phagocytosis in living cells.

Phagocytes comprise a very important factor in the neutralization of infections by potentially harmful microorganisms (1Lekstrom-Himes J.A. Gallin J.I. N. Engl. J. Med. 2000; 343: 1703-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Their main task is to track down, phagocytose, and subject the microbes to an impressive array of antimicrobial proteins and products, a combination that ultimately leads to eradication of the infection (1Lekstrom-Himes J.A. Gallin J.I. N. Engl. J. Med. 2000; 343: 1703-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). One of the most important, and best studied, antimicrobial systems is the phagocyte NADPH oxidase (2Babior B.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 1464-1476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Lambeth J.D. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2002; 9: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). This enzyme produces superoxide in the phagosome by transferring electrons from NADPH in the cytosol over the phagosomal membrane to molecular oxygen (4DeLeo F.R. Allen L.A. Apicella M. Nauseef W.M. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6732-6740PubMed Google Scholar). The superoxide generated by the phagocyte NADPH oxidase forms the basic compound from which other reactive oxygen species (ROS), 1The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; STZ, serum-treated zymosan; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP; FRAP, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching; CGD, chronic granulomatous disease.1The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; STZ, serum-treated zymosan; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP; FRAP, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching; CGD, chronic granulomatous disease. such as hydrogen peroxide and hypochlorous acid, are formed. High concentrations of ROS in the phagosome are toxic and ultimately lead to killing of the phagocytosed microbe (2Babior B.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 1464-1476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Hampton M.B. Kettle A.J. Winterbourn C.C. Blood. 1998; 92: 3007-3017Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the transfer of electrons over the phagosomal membrane leads to changes in the membrane potential that are crucial for the influx of K+ ions into the phagosome, an event that liberates matrix-bound proteases to diffuse freely into the phagosome and contribute to the successful killing of the microorganism (6Reeves E.P. Lu H. Jacobs H.L. Messina C.G. Bolsover S. Gabella G. Potma E.O. Warley A. Roes J. Segal A.W. Nature. 2002; 416: 291-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). Thus, there is a central role for the phagocyte NADPH oxidase in the killing of phagocytosed microorgansisms, a direct one in generating ROS and an indirect one in the dispersion of intracellular proteases in the phagosome. Since ROS are potentially harmful to the host itself, the activity of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase is tightly regulated in space and time. The enzymatic core of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase is flavocytochrome b558, which consists of two integral membrane proteins, p22phox and gp91phox (phox: phagocyte oxidase). Flavocytochrome b558 contains the FAD and two heme groups needed to transfer electrons from NADPH to oxygen (7Vignais P.V. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 1428-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). The activity of flavocytochrome b558 is regulated by the interaction with three cytosolic proteins, p47phox, p67phox, and Rac2 (8Babior B.M. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2002; 4: 35-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 9Nisimoto Y. Motalebi S. Han C.H. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22999-23005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 10Bokoch G.M. Diebold B.A. Blood. 2002; 100: 2692-2696Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Mutations in any of these five subunits can lead to a severe immunodeficiency, called chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) (11Roos D. de Boer M. Kuribayashi F. Meischl C. Weening R.S. Segal A.W. Ahlin A. Nemet K. Hossle J.P. Bernatowska-Matuszkiewicz E. Middleton-Price H. Blood. 1996; 87: 1663-1681Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CGD is characterized by defective killing of phagocytosed pathogens, which leads to recurrent life-threatening infections. Activation of gp91phox is induced after the translocation of the cytosolic proteins to the phagosomal membrane and their subsequent interaction with the flavocytochrome (2Babior B.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 1464-1476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The translocation of p47phox, p67phox, and Rac2 is driven by several changes in the conformation of these proteins, occurring after binding of chemokines or opsonins to phagocyte surface receptors (8Babior B.M. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2002; 4: 35-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 10Bokoch G.M. Diebold B.A. Blood. 2002; 100: 2692-2696Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The Rho GTPase Rac2 is dissociated from its inhibitor RhoGDI after stimulation and is then able to interact with membranes via its prenylated C terminus (10Bokoch G.M. Diebold B.A. Blood. 2002; 100: 2692-2696Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Once attached to the membrane, Rac2 is able to bind to flavocytochrome b558 and forms a binding partner for p67phox (10Bokoch G.M. Diebold B.A. Blood. 2002; 100: 2692-2696Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The cytosolic proteins p47phox and p67phox can form a complex with another protein, p40phox, in the cytosol of the neutrophil (12Lapouge K. Smith S.J. Groemping Y. Rittinger K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10121-10128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). During activation, phosphorylation of p47phox at crucial serine residues leads to conformational changes in this protein, allowing the formation of the p47phox-p67phox-p40phox complex as well (12Lapouge K. Smith S.J. Groemping Y. Rittinger K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10121-10128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 13Karathanassis D. Stahelin R.V. Bravo J. Perisic O. Pacold C.M. Cho W. Williams R.L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5057-5068Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The outcome of these conformational changes is an increase in the capacity of these proteins to interact with the membrane, with Rac2, and with flavocytochrome b558, three interactions that are crucial for translocation and subsequent activation of gp91phox (9Nisimoto Y. Motalebi S. Han C.H. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22999-23005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 10Bokoch G.M.

To study the translocation of p67phox and Rac2 during phagocytosis in living cells, GFP-tagged fusions of these proteins were introduced in the myeloid cell line, PLB-985. The translocation kinetics of these proteins were studied during phagocytosis by wild-type PLB-985 cells as well as by PLB-985 cells that do not express flavocytochrome b558 due to targeted disruption of gp91phox expression (PLB-985 X-CGD) (15Zhen L. King A.A. Xiao Y. Chanock S.J. Orkin S.H. Dinauer M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9832-9836Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Furthermore, by means of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments, we found that the translocation of p67phox and Rac2 is a cyclic process, in which flavocytochrome b558-bound p67GFP and GFP-Rac2 are continuously exchanged for free p67GFP and GFP-Rac2. Finally, the effect of the actin-modifying compound cytochalasin B on the translocation of p67phox and Rac2 during phagocytosis was investigated. The disruption of the actin cytoskeleton by this compound did not change the localization of p67GFP and GFP-Rac2, nor did it affect the cyclic translocation, indicating that the actin cytoskeleton is not important for the correct localization of these proteins during phagocytosis. Culture of Cell Lines—K562, PLB-985, and ϕnx-α cells were cultured in Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (200 μg/ml), streptomycin (200 μg/ml), and l-glutamine (4 mm)inaCO2 incubator at 37 °C. PLB-985 cells were induced to differentiate to granulocytes by the addition of 0.5% dimethylformamide. The cells were then cultured for 6 days and subsequently harvested. Generation of Fluorescent Constructs—For the generation of C-terminally GFP-tagged p67phox, the cDNA encoding p67phox was amplified with primers designed to discard the stop codon of this gene. In addition, these primers contained restriction sites (EcoRI, ApaI) to facilitate further cloning into the pEGFP vector (Clontech). The primers used were (5′ to 3′) gatcgaattccctaatcatgtccctggtggagg (sense) and (5′ to 3′) gatcgggcccggacttctctccgagtgcttt (antisense). The PCR reaction contained PWO polymerase (Roche Applied Science), buffer, dNTPs, 100 ng of plasmid DNA encoding p67, and 100 ng of each primer. The PCR conditions used were: 1 cycle, 95 °C, 5 min; 35 cycles, 1 min, 95 °C; 1 min, 56 °C, and 2.5 min, 68 °C, and 1 cycle, 5 min, 68 °C. The PCR product was purified over QiaSpin PCR purification columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The PCR product and the destination vector pEGFP were then digested with EcoRI and ApaI for 1.5 h at 37 °C. Both digests were run on a low melting point agarose gel (1% w/v) and stained with ethidium bromide. DNA fragments of the right size were cut out of the gel and purified with QiaQuick columns (Qiagen). Fragments were ligated with the FastLink ligase kit (Epicenter Technologies, Madison, WI) and subsequently transformed into competent DH5α cells. Plasmids were examined for correct inserts by restriction digests and sequenced for detection of unwanted mutations. Analogously, GFP-Rac2 was generated by fusing eGFP N-terminally with Rac2. For the cloning of Rac2 in the eGFP vector, the cDNA of Rac2 was amplified with primers containing XhoI and NotI restriction sites. The primers used were (5′ to 3′) gatcctcgagttcaggccatcaagtgtgtg (sense) and (5′ to 3′) gagatcgcggccgcctagaggaggctgcagg (antisense). The PCR reaction and subsequent cloning were carried out as described for the p67GFP construct. Transient Expression of p67GFP and GFP-Rac2 in K562 Cells—K562 cells stably expressing p22phox, p47phox, and gp91phox (16de Mendez I. Leto T.L. Blood. 1995; 85: 1104-1110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were transiently transfected by electroporation (0.25 kV, capacitance 960 micro-farads, 0 ohms of resistance) on a Bio-Rad Biopulser with GFP, wild-type p67phox, p67GFP, or GFP-Rac2. Cells were grown for 48 h before analysis. GFP expression was assayed by flow cytometry on a BD Biosciences FacsStar. Hydrogen Peroxide Generation by K562 Cells—Hydrogen peroxide production of K562 cells after phorbol myristate acetate (Sigma) activation was measured by the Amplex Red Assay (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) measured on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences plate reader. Western Blotting of K562 Cells—For immunodetection, 105 cells were boiled in SDS sample buffer (125 mmol/liter Tris, pH 6.8; 20% (w/v) SDS, and 12.5% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol) for 5 min and loaded on a 12.5% polyacrylamide gel, according to Laemmli (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar), in a gel apparatus (Mini-Protean II, Bio-Rad). Western blotting was performed (Mini Trans-Blot cell, Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. For the detection of p67GFP and GFP-Rac2, a polyclonal antibody against GFP (Clontech, catalog number 8372-1) was used. The secondary antibody was a swine-anti-rabbit-Ig horseradish peroxidase-conjugated polyclonal antibody (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark). Detection was performed with the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) kit (Amersham Biosciences). Stable Expression of Selected Mutants in PLB-985 Cells—PLB-985 and PLB-985 X-CGD cells were retrovirally transduced with p67GFP or GFP-Rac2. In brief, cDNA constructs encoding p67GFP and GFP-Rac2 were cloned from the pEGFP vector into the retroviral expression vector pLZRS. pLZRS constructs were then transfected into a retroviral packaging cell line (ϕnx-ampho) by calcium phosphate transfection (Invitrogen). After selection of transfected cells by puromycin (1 μg/ml) (Invitrogen), virus was harvested and used for retroviral transduction of PLB-985 and PLB-985 X-CGD cells with 10 μg/ml of N-(1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl)-N,N,N-trimethylammonium chloride (Roche Applied Science). Transduced cells were sorted on a FacsStar (BD Biosciences) cell sorter. Confocal Imaging of PLB-985 Cells—For in vivo imaging of p67GFP and GFP-Rac2 fusion proteins, 500 μl of a suspension of 2 × 106 PLB-985 cells transduced with these constructs were allowed to adhere to glass coverslips in complete Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium at 37 °C in a heat stage. Cells were allowed to adhere for 5 min before serum-treated zymosan (STZ) was added. Images were taken using a Zeiss Axiovert 100 confocal laser scanning microscope and analyzed with LSM 5 software (Zeiss, Göttingen, Germany). Fluorescence Recovery after Photobleaching (FRAP)—PLB-985 cells were allowed to adhere to glass coverslips in complete Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium at 37 °C in a heat stage. Cells were allowed to adhere for 5 min before STZ was added. Rectangles were bleached with the full intensity of a 488-nm laser beam, and the recovery of fluorescence in the bleached spot was quantified with LSM 5 software (Zeiss). The experiments were performed several times on different days. Generation of p67GFPand GFP-Rac2 Fusion Proteins and Expression in K562 Cells—For live imaging of p67phox translocation, the cDNA encoding this protein was fused C-terminally to GFP. Before the fusion of the cDNAs, the ATG of the GFP cDNA was deleted by site-directed mutagenesis because free GFP was observed when several different fusion proteins were constructed with the parent vector containing the start codon. K562 cells already expressing p22phox, gp91phox, and p47phox were transfected with the p67GFP construct, wild-type p67phox, or GFP. The superoxide-producing capacity of the cells transfected with the p67GFP construct was compared with K562 cells transfected with wild-type p67phox and with the GFP-transfected K562 cells that express all NADPH oxidase components except p67phox. Upon phorbol myristate acetate stimulation, K562 cells transfected with wild-type p67phox were able to produce hydrogen peroxide, in contrast to GFP-transfected cells, which showed no NADPH oxidase activity (Table I). The K562 cells expressing the p67GFP construct showed similar superoxide-producing capacities as the wild-type p67phox-transfected cells (Table I), proving that this construct is able to fulfill its role in the activation of the NADPH oxidase. To ensure that GFP was not cleaved from the C terminus of p67phox, a possibility that could not be excluded from the previous experiments, Western blot analysis was performed on total lysates of the transfected K562 cells. As controls, untransfected, GFP-transfected, and wild-type p67phox-transfected K562 cells were taken. The fusion protein was detected after staining with anti-GFP at a molecular mass of ∼95 kDa, in good agreement with its predicted molecular mass (94 kDa) (Fig. 1).Table IHydrogen peroxide production by K562 cells Hydrogen peroxide-producing capacity of K562 cells transfected with empty vector, eGFP, wild-type p67phox, or p67GFP. In addition, the effect of GFP-Rac2 expression was tested in K562 cells that expressed all essential components of the NADPH oxidase. The number of cells tested for hydrogen peroxide production was corrected for the percentage of transfected cells of each individual transfection. Values are given as relative fluorescence units (RFUs), with wild-type p67phox-transfected cells at 10,000 RFUs. The RFUs generated by untransfected cells were subtracted.

This approach has been used successfully for Rac1 and several other small GTPases (17Itoh R.E. Kurokawa K. Ohba Y. Yoshizaki H. Mochizuki N. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 6582-6591Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Due to the lack of Rac-negative K562 cells, it was impossible to prove that the GFP-Rac2 fusion is able to perform the function of wild-type Rac2 in the activation of the NADPH oxidase. However, no inhibitory effect of this construct was observed on hydrogen peroxide production in K562 cells stably transfected with p47phox, p67phox, and gp91phox (Table I). Furthermore, the GFP-Rac2 fusion protein was detected at the expected molecular mass of 48 kDa by Western blotting (Fig. 1). Localization of p67GFP and GFP-Rac2 during NADPH Oxidase Activation—The localization of p67GFP and GFP-Rac2 during NADPH oxidase activation was studied in PLB-985 cells. The constructs were retrovirally expressed in myeloid PLB-985 cells and in a derivative of this cell line in which the expression of gp91phox has been disrupted, i.e. PLB-985 X-CGD cells. The cells were then induced to differentiate into granulocytes. The localization of the fusion proteins was studied during phagocytosis of STZ. Upon binding of STZ to both PLB-985 cell lines, p67GFP was rapidly recruited to the site of attachment (Fig. 2a). During particle internalization and the formation of a phagosome, p67GFP was located at the membrane of the phagosome in both cell lines. When the particle was completely taken up, p67GFP in the wild-type cells remained located around the phagosomes through time (Fig. 2, a and b). In contrast, p67GFP was lost from the phagosome in the PLB-985 X-CGD cells after complete uptake of the STZ particles (Fig. 2, c and d). An identical pattern was observed for the localization of GFP-Rac2 (Fig. 2, e–h). Like p67GFP, this fusion protein is also located at the phagosome during and after complete internalization of the particle by PLB-985 cells, but loss of the protein from the phagosome was observed after internalization of STZ in PLB-985 X-CGD cells. These findings are consistent with previous studies that showed loss of cytosolic NADPH oxidase components from the phagosomal membrane in X-CGD neutrophils, identifying cytochrome b558 as an essential factor for correct translocation of p47phox, p67phox, and Rac2 (18Allen L.A. DeLeo F.R. Gallois A. Toyoshima S. Suzuki K. Nauseef W.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 3521-3530Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Dusi S. Donini M. Rossi F. Biochem.

Chem. 1994; 269: 30749-30752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, in PLB-985 X-CGD cells, the translocation of p47phox, p67phox, and Rac2 is known to be disturbed (21Biberstine-Kinkade K.J. Yu L. Dinauer M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10451-10457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Together with the observation that p67GFP and GFP-Rac2 localize correctly in both PLB-985 and PLB-985 X-CGD cells, this identifies the p67GFP and GFP-Rac2 expressing cell lines as suitable models to study the localization of these proteins in more detail. Photobleaching of p67GFP and GFP-Rac2 during NADPH Oxidase Activation—To investigate the turnover of p67phox and Rac2 on the phagosomal membrane, FRAP experiments were performed with the p67GFP- and GFP-Rac2-expressing PLB-985 cells. First, the bleaching protocol (see “Experimental Procedures”) was tested on fixed PLB-985 cells expressing p67GFP or GFP-Rac2 to ensure that all fluorescence was bleached in the target area with these specific settings. Indeed, the fluorescence in p67GFP- and GFP-Rac2-expressing cells completely disappeared in the bleached area under these conditions (data not shown). PLB-985 cells were then allowed to phagocytose STZ, and bleaching of phagosomes was performed after the completion of phagocytosis. At the phagosome, the fluorescence of p67GFP at the site of photobleaching was rapidly restored, with a recovery time (t½, time in which 50% of the fluorescence is recovered in the bleached area) that was generally lower than the scan time (700 ms) needed for the generation of an image by confocal laser scanning microscopy, thus preventing a reliable estimation of the t½ for this protein (Fig. 3a). The translocation of GFP-Rac2 was also investigated by FRAP (Fig. 3b). This protein also displayed rapid recovery at the site of bleaching, again with a t½ that was lower than 700 ms. Sequential bleaching of the same spot in individual PLB-985 cells expressing p67GFP or GFP-Rac2 led to a complete loss of fluorescence in the whole cell, illustrating the free diffusion of these proteins throughout the cell (data not shown). Effects of Actin-modifying Compounds on Translocation of p67GFP and GFP-Rac2—Phagocytosis is an actin-dependent event, and actin polymerization is rapidly induced upon binding of an opsonized particle to phagocyte surface receptors (22Tse S.M.

F-actin is surrounding the particle during internalization, after which actin is lost again from the phagosome (24Lowry M.B. Duchemin A.M. Robinson J.M. Anderson C.L. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 161-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Depolymerization of the actin cytoskeleton by actin-modifying compounds inhibits phagocytosis by preventing the internalization but not the binding of opsonized particles (23Coppolino M.G. Dierckman R. Loijens J. Collins R.F. Pouladi M. Jongstra-Bilen J. Schreiber A.D. Trimble W.S. Anderson R. Grinstein S. J. Biol.

Several reports have indicated the importance of an intact actin cytoskeleton for NADPH oxidase activity, in the cell-free system as well as in living cells (25Granfeldt D. Dahlgren C. Inflammation. 2001; 25: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 26Morimatsu T. Kawagoshi A. Yoshida K. Tamura M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 230: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 27Tamura M. Kanno M. Endo Y. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). During activation of the NADPH oxidase, the cytosolic oxidase components bind to the cytoskeleton, as determined by analysis of the detergent-insoluble cytoskeletal fraction (28Nauseef W.M. Volpp B.D. McCormick S. Leidal K.G. Clark R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5911-5917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, p47phox has been shown to bind directly to actin, and p47phox and p67phox have been shown to accumulate on nascent phagosomes together with F-actin (29Tamura M. Kai T. Tsunawaki S. Lambeth J.D. Kameda K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 1186-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Whether correct p67GFP and GFP-Rac2 localization requires an intact and rearranging actin cytoskeleton during phagocytosis was tested in PLB-985 cells by treating the cells with the actin-modifying compound cytochalasin B. First, the importance of an intact actin cytoskeleton for the translocation of p67GFP and GFP-Rac2 after binding of STZ particles to the cell surface was determined. PLB-985 cells were pretreated with cytochalasin B, a potent actin-depolymerizing agent, before the addition of STZ. As expected, pretreatment with cytochalasin B inhibited the uptake of STZ after binding and diminished the translocation of p67GFP and GFP-Rac2 to the site of STZ attachment (Fig. 4, a–d). The same result was obtained by pretreating PLB-985 cells with latrunculin A, a compound that, like cytochalasin B, depolymerizes existing actin filaments (not shown). Since the translocation of p67GFP and GFP-Rac2 to phagosomes proved to be a continuous process, as concluded from the FRAP experiments, the question was raised of whether this process of continuous translocation to the phagosome requires an intact actin cytoskeleton. To determine the effect of disruption of the actin cytoskeleton on the translocation of p67GFP and GFP-Rac2 during and after phagocytosis, cells were allowed to take up STZ for 5 min before cytochalasin B was added. Typically, the addition of this compound rapidly led to an arrest in phagocytosis and cell movement. However, the localization of p67GFP and GFP-Rac2 was not altered in cytochalasin B-treated cells in comparison with untreated cells (not shown). To determine whether the process of continuous translocation of p67GFP and GFP-Rac2 to the phagosome was still intact in PLB-985 cells with a disrupted actin cytoskeleton, FRAP experiments were performed on cytochalasin B-treated cells (Fig. 5, a and b). Like untreated cells, cytochalasin B-treated cells showed a rapid recovery of fluorescence at the bleached spots of the phagosome (Figs. 5b and 6). In all cases, the t½ was too small to be reliably detected by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Furthermore, the use of actin-modifying agents allowed the bleaching of phagocytic cups because uptake of STZ particles was arrested after the addition of either cytochalasin B or latrunculin A. FRAP experiments of phagocytic cups showed no differences in recovery between fluorescence at completely closed phagosomes and phagocytic cups (not shown).Fig. 6FRAP kinetics of p67GFP and GFP-Rac2 in PLB-985 cells. In this experiment, cells were allowed to phagocytose STZ for 5 min before cytochalasin B or latrunculin A was added. Single phagosomes were bleached for 1 s, and fluorescence recovery was subsequently measured. The recovery kinetics for untreated cells and for cells treated with the actin-modifying compounds cytochalasin B and latrunculin A were determined. Shown are representative curves for each condition. Relative fluorescence at a given time point is defined as the ratio of fluorescence of the bleached spot over the whole cell at a given time point divided by the ratio of fluorescence of the bleached spot over the whole cell at t = 0.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The NADPH oxidase of phagocytic leukocytes consists of the membrane-bound flavocytochrome b558 and three essential cytosolic components, p47phox, p67phox, and Rac2. In this report, the localization of p67phox and Rac2 during NADPH oxidase activation was studied by means of GFP fusions of these proteins. The p67GFP fusion protein was first tested for its ability to support superoxide production in K562 cells expressing all essential NADPH oxidase components but lacking p67phox expression. Expression of the fusion protein was seen to restore the superoxide-producing capacity of the K562 cells. Initially, the same approach was taken for p47phox, but the p47GFP fusion protein was not able to restore superoxide production in K562 cells lacking p47phox (data not shown); therefore, this construct was not used in this study. The GFP-Rac2 could not be tested in a similar manner, but the GFP-Rac2 fusion protein did not have deleterious effects on superoxide production by K562 cells. Expressed in a granulocytic cell line, p67GFP and GFP-Rac2 show the same intracellular localization as the endogenous proteins during STZ phagocytosis. Additionally, their localization was disturbed in later stages of phagocytosis in cells that lack gp91phox, which is consistent with experiments performed previously with these cell lines as well as with granulocytes from CGD patients (18Allen L.A. DeLeo F.R. Gallois A. Toyoshima S. Suzuki K. Nauseef W.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 3521-3530Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Grogan A. Reeves E. Keep N. Wientjes F. Totty N.F. Burlingame A.L. Hsuan J.J. Segal A.W. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 3071-3081Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During phagosome formation, the translocation of the cytoplasmic NADPH oxidase components and their subsequent interaction with flavocytochrome b558 may result in the formation of a stable complex of these proteins. Alternatively, the cytoplasmic components p47phox, p67phox, and Rac2 may only transiently associate with flavocytochrome b558. Since the translocation of the cytosolic NADPH oxidase components is rapidly terminated in cells that lack flavocytochrome b558, it is generally believed that flavocytochrome b558 and the cytosolic proteins form a stable complex, resulting in the containment of the cytosolic proteins at the phagosomal membrane. To determine the turnover of p67GFP and GFP-Rac2 on the phagosome, FRAP experiments were performed. The fluorescence recovery of both proteins was extremely rapid, indicating that there is continuous exchange of soluble p67GFP and GFP-Rac2 for flavocytochrome b558-bound p67GFP and GFP-Rac2, even after complete internalization of zymosan particles. This is in accordance with a previous study in which evidence was obtained, suggesting that a limited amount of cytosolic components can activate an excess of flavocytochrome b558, which also argues against the formation of a stoichiometric complex between the cytosolic factors and flavocytochrome b558 (31Cross A.R. Erickson R.W. Curnutte J.T. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 251-255Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, Akard et al. (32Akard L.P. English D. Gabig T.G. Blood. 1988; 72: 322-327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have provided evidence that sustained superoxide production is a result of continuous replenishment of a pool of active NADPH oxidase, which is also in line with the data obtained in this study. The presence of flavocytochrome b558 in the membrane is crucial for the observed continuous translocation of the cytosolic proteins, as illustrated by the loss of p67GFP and GFP-Rac2 from the phagosomes of PLB-985 X-CGD cells. This is in sharp contrast to the translocation of the cytosolic proteins to nascent phagosomes, which clearly does not depend on the presence of flavocytochrome b558, since p67GFP and GFP-Rac2 localize correctly during this stage of phagocytosis in PLB-985 X-CGD cells. Furthermore, the involvement of the actin cytoskeleton in the translocation of p67phox and Rac2 during phagocytosis was investigated by the use of an actin-modifying agent. The effect of cytochalasin B, a potent actin depolymerizing agent, on the translocation behavior of p67GFP and GFP-Rac2 was tested. Pretreatment of PLB-985 cells with this compound prevented an increase in the amount of p67GFP and GFP-Rac2 at the binding site of STZ, identifying the importance of the actin cytoskeleton in the initiation of the translocation of p67GFP and GFP-Rac2. It remains unclear why disruption of the actin cytoskeleton disturbs the primary translocation of the cytosolic factors. Rac2, p40phox, and p47phox have been shown to be able to interact with the membrane through their prenylated C terminus or PX domains, respectively (14Stahelin R.V. Burian A. Bruzik K.S. Murray D. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; Google Scholar, 33Tao W. Filippi M.D. Bailey J.R. Atkinson S.J. Connors B. Evan A. Williams D.A. Blood. 2002; 100: 1679-1688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Ando S. Kaibuchi K. Sasaki T. Hiraoka K. Nishiyama T. Mizuno T. Asada M. Nunoi H. Matsuda I. Matsuura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25709-25713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In cytochalasin B-treated cells, the interaction of the PX domains of p40phox and p47phox with the phosphoinositides formed in the membrane after binding of STZ particles to cell surface receptors was anticipated to still occur, as well as the interaction of Rac2 with the membrane. However, the translocation of p67GFP and GFP-Rac2 is absent in cytochalasin B-treated cells upon binding of zymosan particles, which identifies the association of these proteins with the actin cytoskeleton as a step preceding the interaction of these proteins with the membrane and flavocytochrome b558. In contrast, cytochalasin B had no effect on the localization and continuous exchange of p67GFP and GFP-Rac2 on the phagosomal membrane when phagocytosis had already been initiated. According to our data, the translocation of cytosolic NADPH oxidase components is independent of the actin cytoskeleton after the initiation of phagocytosis. Several earlier reports have indicated the importance of actin polymerization for NADPH oxidase activity (25Granfeldt D. Dahlgren C. Inflammation. 2001; 25: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 26Morimatsu T. Kawagoshi A. Yoshida K. Tamura M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 230: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 27Tamura M. Kanno M. Endo Y. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, most of these experiments were performed in a cell-free system and did not address the translocation of the cytosolic factors to flavocytochrome b558. Furthermore, inhibition of NADPH oxidase activity in intact cells may well be due to the effects of actin cytoskeleton disruption on primary translocation, which was not identified in these studies. Besides actin-modifying compounds, several other pharmacological agents were tested in PLB-985 p67GFP and GFP-Rac2 cells. In an attempt to identify the mechanism that drives the continuous translocation of p67phox and Rac2, the PLB-985 cells were treated with several inhibitors after the addition of STZ. Among these agents were LY290042 (PI3-kinase inhibitor), staurosporine (a general inhibitor of protein kinase C), SB20358 (an inhibitor of p38MAPK), and U0126 (an inhibitor of pErk). Unfortunately, no effect of any of these inhibitors was found on the continuous translocation of p67GFP and GFP-Rac2. The lack of effect of these inhibitors is probably due to simultaneous stimulation of several signal transduction routes, leading to activation of the NADPH oxidase. Overall, these results indicate that the translocation of p67phox and Rac2 during phagocytosis can be divided into three stages. The first stage is the initiation of phagocytosis after binding of an opsonized particle, in which translocation is dependent on an intact actin cytoskeleton and independent of flavocytochrome b558. The second stage is the formation of the phagosome, during which translocation seems to be independent of flavocytochrome b558 and the cytoskeleton but may be dependent on the interaction of the PX domains of p40phox and p47phox and the prenylated C terminus of Rac2 with the membrane. The last stage, after closure of the phagosome, requires the presence of flavocytochrome b558 for correct localization of p67phox and Rac2. Further studies are needed to elucidate the role of the actin cytoskeleton in NADPH oxidase activity in living cells during phagocytosis as well as the mechanism that drives continuous translocation of p67phox and Rac2 to the phagosomal membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2048887881,"Transcription start site selection in eukaryotes is mediated through combinations of the TATA, initiator (Inr), and downstream promoter elements (DPE). In Trichomonas vaginalis, a parabasalian flagellate thought to represent an ancient eukaryote lineage, the Inr appears to be solely responsible for start site selection and is recognized by the initiator binding protein 39 kDa (IBP39). IBP39 contains an N-terminal Inr binding domain (IBD) connected via a flexible linker to a C-terminal domain (C domain). Here we present crystal structures of the apoIBD and IBD-Inr complexes and the C domain. The IBD structures reveal a winged-helix motif with prokaryotic and eukaryotic features and a scaffold similar to that of ETS-family proteins. The C domain structure and biochemical studies indicate that it interacts with the T. vaginalis RNAP II large subunit C-terminal domain. These data suggest that binding of IBP39 to the Inr directly recruits RNAP II and in this way initiates transcription."

Hain J. Thuriaux P. Zillig W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5768-5772Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Archaeal TBP and TFB are functionally and structurally highly homologous to eukaryotic TBP and TFIIB (5Littlefield O. Korkhin Y. Sigler P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 25-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), and this, together with the homology between archaeal and eukaryotic RNAPs, suggests that the basic mechanism of transcription initiation has been conserved between the Archaea and Eukaryotes. Archaeal and eukaryotic transcription systems have diverged in important ways, particularly in that eukaryotic RNAP II requires a large set of general transcription factors (7Orphanides G. Lagrange T. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2657-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar), for proper function in the context of a highly organized and regulated chromatin environment, and partly because additional control points are placed along the reaction pathway leading to productive RNA chain elongation. However, the archaeal transcription system provides a simple system for studying the basic mechanism of transcription initiation by eukaryotic-type RNAPs. RNA polymerase bovine serum albumin 2-nitro-5-thiocyanobenzoic acid. Archaeal transcription initiation begins with promoter binding by TBP, which recognizes A-T rich sequences (box A, Ref. 8Hain J.

TFB recognizes TBP bound to DNA and makes site-specific interactions with DNA upstream of the TATA box (the B recognition element, BRE; Fig. 1A) (10Qureshi S.A. Jackson S.P. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 389-400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), defining the orientation of the complex, and thus the direction of transcription (11Bell S.D. Cairns S.S.

This ternary complex recruits RNAP to the promoter for transcription initiation, but the details of interaction between RNAP, TBP, TFB, and promoter DNA in the archaeal transcription initiation complex are not well characterized. The topography of transcription initiation complexes from eukaryotes and bacteria has been studied in detail by DNA site-specific photochemical cross-linking (12Bartholomew B. Durkovich D.

In conjunction with RNAP structural information, these studies have led to models for eukaryotic and bacterial initiation complexes that delineate the path of promoter DNA relative to the RNAP and transcription factors. We have applied similar cross-linking techniques to analyze the arrangement of proteins in archaeal transcription initiation complexes assembled with promoter DNA and TBP, TFB1 and RNAP from the hyperthermophilic euryarchaeon Pyrococcus furiosus. A preliminary study established the orientation of DNA downstream of the transcriptional start site (modeled using the bacterial RNAP structure) (16Bartlett M.S. Thomm M. Geiduschek E.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 782-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We have extended this analysis and incorporated modifications that have improved the resolution of the data, using proteins from P. furiosus and from two Methanococcaceae. The presented results suggest a path of DNA in a euryarchaeal transcription initiation complex. DNA and Proteins—DNA fragments spanning the P. furiosus gdh promoter (bp -60 to +35 or +37, relative to the transcriptional start as +1) were used for transcription and formation of protein complexes. P. furiosus TFB1, TBP, and RNA polymerase were prepared as described (17Hethke C. Geerling A.C. Hausner W. de Vos W.M. Thomm M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2369-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Preparation of the corresponding Methanothermococcus thermolithotrophicus and Methanocaldococcus jannaschii proteins has also been described (18Frey G. Thomm M. Brudigam B. Gohl H.P. Hausner W.

All TBPs and TFBs were recombinant proteins, overproduced in Escherichia coli. Transcription Complex Formation—P. furiosus transcription complexes were assembled essentially as described (16Bartlett M.S. Thomm M. Geiduschek E.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 782-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar): 2 nmgdh promoter DNA was incubated with 20 nm TBP, 60 nm TFB1, and 10 nm RNAP in 12.5 μl of 40 mm sodium HEPES (pH 7.3 at 25 °C), 250 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA). M. thermolithotrophicus and M. jannaschii transcription complexes were formed with 20 nm TBP, 20 nm TFB, and 6 nm RNAP in 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0 at 25 °C), 180 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.1 mg/ml BSA. When indicated, nonspecific DNA competitor (plasmid pUC19 digested with blunt cutters PvuII, RsaI, and BsrBI) was present at 48 μg/ml during complex formation. Complexes were formed at 65 °C (P. furiosus) or 55 °C (M. thermolithotrophicus and M. jannaschii) for 40 min. Heparin was then added (50 μg/ml) along with specific DNA competitor (gdh promoter DNA bp -60 to +37 at 400 nm) when indicated. In transcription reactions NTPs were added (to 500 μm ATP, GTP, and CTP, and 10 μm [α-32P]UTP at 40 Ci/mmol) 30 s after heparin addition, reactions were incubated at 65 °C (P. furiosus) or 55 °C (M. thermolithotrophicus and M. jannaschii) for 20 min, and transcription was halted by addition of an equal volume of deionized formamide containing bromphenol blue and xylene cyanol (each at 1 mg/ml). Cross-linking—For cross-linking, protein-DNA complexes were formed as above, using internally α-32P-labeled gdh promoter derivatives containing azidophenacylated phosphorothioate or AB-dUMP (5-[N′-(p-azidobenzoyl)-3-aminoallyl]dUMP) at specific locations, prepared as described (16Bartlett M.S. Thomm M. Geiduschek E.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 782-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Probes were radiolabeled by DNA polymerase-directed incorporation of radioactive dNTP(s) (3000 Ci/mmol) 3′ to the phosphorothioate-containing dNTP or AB-dUMP; therefore individual probes contained one to four radioactive nucleotides, as follows: four radiolabels in probe -11NT and -7T; three in -31NT, -15NT, -27T, -11T; two in -35NT, -23NT, -9NT, +8NT, +14NT, +16NT, +20NT, -33T, -15T, -9T, +4T, +6T, +14T, +16T, and +19T; the rest of the probes had one radioactive nucleotide. Reaction mixtures were UV irradiated at 65 °C (P. furiosus) or 55 °C (M. thermolithotrophicus and M. jannaschii), as described (21Bartholomew B. Tinker R.L. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 476-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) 30 s after addition of heparin (no DNA competitors), or 10 min after addition of heparin and specific DNA competitor, as specified. Following cross-linking, complexes were treated with nuclease and analyzed on 4-20% gradient polyacrylamide-SDS gels, essentially as described (21Bartholomew B. Tinker R.L. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 476-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Cross-linked proteins were detected by autoradiography using phosphor image plates. Where indicated, UV-irradiated complexes were separated on 4% polyacrylamide native gels, bands containing the desired protein-DNA complexes were excised from the gel, and complexes were eluted overnight in 800 μl elution buffer (10 mm Tris, 0.05% SDS, and 15 μg/ml BSA), then concentrated by microfiltration and washed 3× with 500 μl of transcription reaction buffer (lacking glycerol and BSA). Washed eluates were concentrated to about 15 μl, and processed using DNase I and micrococcal nuclease (10 units of each); entire samples were loaded onto 4-20% gradient polyacrylamide-SDS gel for analysis. Chemical Cleavage of RNAP Subunit H—Typical cross-linking reactions were performed using P. furiosus polypeptides and gdh promoter DNA containing AB-dUMP at bp +19 of the transcribed (T) strand. Reaction products were processed with nuclease, and proteins were separated on 4-20% gradient polyacrylamide-SDS gels. Radiolabeled bands were visualized by phosphor imaging, and the cross-linked small RNAP subunit was excised and eluted overnight in 450 μl of 10 mm Tris pH 8.0, 0.2% SDS, and 25 μg/ml BSA. Eluates were concentrated by microfiltration, and the concentrated eluate was divided and treated with various chemical cleavage reagents. Cyanogen bromide (CNBr) and 2-nitro-5-thiocyanobenzoic acid (NTCB) treatments were performed as described (22Shah S.M. Kumar A. Geiduschek E.P. Kassavetis G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28736-28744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) except that CNBr treatment was for 16 h at 300 mm, and NTCB treatment was for 3.5 h at 50 mm to induce more complete cleavage at methionine and cysteine residues, respectively. Mock treatments were identical but lacked CNBr or NTCB. For cleavage at Asp-Pro (23Jue R.A. Doolittle R.F. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 162-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), formic acid was added to 50% (v/v) and reacted at 40 °C for 16 h. CNBr was then added to 0.9 mm; after 3 min at room temperature, reaction samples were diluted 10-fold with water, dried down by vacuum centrifugation, resuspended in protein gel sample buffer and analyzed by 6-25% gradient polyacrylamide-SDS gel electrophoresis; labeled proteins were visualized by phosphor image plate autoradiography. A DNA site-specific photochemical cross-linking method was used to examine the path of DNA through the archaeal transcription initiation complex. A set of photoactive DNA probes was constructed by attaching a single azidophenacyl (AP) group to every other nucleotide on both strands of the P. furiosus (Pfu) glutamate dehydrogenase (gdh) promoter, covering bp -35 to +20 (relative to the transcriptional start site as +1; Fig. 1A). Probes were checked for ability to support specifically initiating run-off transcription at 65 °C and this led to two interesting observations: 1) Derivatization with azidophenacyl bromide (APB) in a segment of the non-transcribed (NT) strand comprising its open transcription bubble (24Spitalny P. Thomm M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30497-30505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and ∼2 flanking base pairs increased transcription activity; the non-polar AP group at these locations may favor polymerase recruitment or, more probably, promoter opening. 2) AP derivatization at the downstream end of the transcribed (template) strand blocked transcript elongation (data not shown). Promoter complexes were formed with these DNA probes, recombinant Pfu transcription factors TBP and TFB1, and native Pfu RNA polymerase (RNAP) at 65 °C and irradiated at the same temperature. A similar approach had been used previously to map cross-links to Pfu RNAP subunits B, A′, and A″ to downstream segments (bp -5 to +20) of the gdh promoter transcribed strand. Homology considerations and the structure of a bacterial RNA polymerase core enzyme (25Zhang G. Campbell E.A. Minakhin L. Richter C. Severinov K. Darst S.A. Cell. 1999; 98: 811-824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar) were used to derive a model of the DNA trajectory and specify the orientation of DNA in the archaeal transcription complex (16Bartlett M.S. Thomm M. Geiduschek E.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 782-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Extension of this analysis to both strands of the promoter, and covering bp -35 to +20, showed cross-links to RNAP subunits between the TATA box and the start site, cross-links to TBP near the TATA box, and cross-links to TFB1 both upstream and downstream of the TATA box. There were also unexpected RNAP cross-links within and upstream of the TATA box, and cross-links to TFB1 that appeared likely to be due to nonspecific binding (data not shown). A DNA competition step was therefore introduced to address the possible presence of nonspecifically bound complexes, based on reasoning that nonspecific binding of transcription factors and RNAP would be diminished by an excess of nonspecific DNA, and that those nonspecific complexes that did form would be less avidly bound and therefore selectively unstable to a subsequent challenge by an excess of specific competitor. Transcription initiation complexes were assembled essentially as described previously (16Bartlett M.S. Thomm M. Geiduschek E.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 782-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and under “Experimental Procedures,” but in the presence of a 400-fold excess of nonspecific competitor DNA (linearized, fragmented bacterial plasmid) during 40 min allowed for complex formation, and then challenged with a 200-fold molar excess of specific competitor (wild-type gdh promoter DNA) for 10 min, before cross-linking. The presence of nonspecific competitor was found to have only a minimal effect on the formation of active transcription complexes (tested by a transcription assay; data not shown) but reduced formation of nonspecific complexes. A representative data set for cross-linking of initiation complexes using the competition protocol is shown for both strands of the gdh promoter in Fig. 1 B and C. RNA Polymerase Cross-links—Most cross-linking to Pfu RNAP was to subunits B, A′, and A″, the archaeal homologues of eukaryotic RNA polymerase II subunits Rpb2 (B) and Rpb1 (A′ and A″). Pfu subunit B was cross-linked between bp -9 and +2 of the non-transcribed (NT) strand and between bp -15 and ∼+14 of the transcribed (T; template) strand. Weak cross-linking to subunit B within and upstream of the TATA box most probably represents residual incorrectly assembled complexes, since the amount of cross-linking to B in this promoter segment (relative to other sites) was reduced in the presence of competitors (data not shown). Subunit A′ was cross-linked mainly to the T strand between bp -7 and +6, with a pair of cross-links to the NT strand at bp +8 and +10. Subunit A″ cross-linked to both the T and NT strands between ∼bp -1 and +20. The A′ and A″ cross-links observed for the transcribed strand are consistent with previously reported results (16Bartlett M.S. Thomm M. Geiduschek E.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 782-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Cross-links to a small polypeptide (∼7-10 kDa) were observed between bp +12 and +20 on the T strand, and bp +14 to +20 on the NT strand, and chemical cleavage was used to identify this small protein as RNAP subunit H (Fig. 2). Cross-links were formed using a photoactive probe with AB-dUMP at bp +19 of the T-strand, which yields the most efficient cross-linking. The cross-linked protein was excised from the gel, eluted, and then treated with cyanogen bromide (cleaving at methionine), NTCB (cleaving at cysteine), or formic acid (cleaving between aspartic acid and proline). The results in Fig. 2B indicate that the small protein lacks Met and Cys, but contains at least one Asp-Pro motif. The experiment was repeated with probes containing AP-derivatized phosphorothioate in the T strand at bp +12 and +16, with the same result (data not shown). The only Pfu small RNAP subunit with this profile is subunit H (Pf1655, 9.2 kDa); the other small RNAP subunits (E″, Pf0255, 6.9 kDa; F, Pf1036, 14.1 kDa; K, Pf1642, 6.2 kDa; L, Pf0050, 11.1 kDa; M, Pf0986, 12.9 kDa; N, Pf1643, 8.9 kDa and P, Pf2009, 5.7kDa; see www.tigr.org/tigr-scripts/CMR2/LocusNameSearch.spl?db = ntpf01 for sequences) (26Robb F.T. Maeder D.L. Brown J.R. DiRuggiero J. Stump M.D. Yeh R.K. Weiss R.B. Dunn D.M. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 330: 134-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) are necessarily excluded as candidates. Subunit H is the archaeal homologue of eukaryotic Rpb5, which is located in close proximity to DNA downstream of the transcription start site in eukaryotic initiation complexes (13Kim T.K. Lagrange T. Wang Y.H. Griffith J.D. Reinberg D. Ebright R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12268-12273Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 27Kim T.K. Ebright R.H. Reinberg D. Science. 2000; 288: 1418-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Transcription Factor Cross-links—The 2.4 Å structure of Pfu TBP and the C-terminal two-thirds of TFB1 bound to TATA-box DNA (5Littlefield O. Korkhin Y. Sigler P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13668-13673Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) specifies that TBP should be cross-linked by probes spanning the TATA box (bp -30 to -22) and that TFB1 should cross-link to DNA just upstream and just downstream of the TATA box. The results shown in Fig. 1 confirm these predictions. In addition, extensive cross-linking of TFB1 was observed downstream of the TATA box, extending nearly to the transcriptional start site on the NT strand, and to bp of +6 of the T strand. These results suggest a trajectory for the N-terminal one-third of TFB1. There were also unexpected cross-links to a 20-25 kDa protein (the same size as TBP) at bp -13 to -7 of the NT strand. The just-described patterns of cross-linking were obtained with mixtures of TFB1, TBP, RNAP, and DNA and might be contributed by transcription factor-DNA complexes or polymerase-containing transcription initiation complexes. In order to focus attention on initiation complexes, these were separated by non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis from DNA complexes containing only TBP and TFB1 (see Fig. 1 of Ref. 16Bartlett M.S. Thomm M. Geiduschek E.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 782-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows the results of such an experiment in which each lane corresponds to an irradiated sample that has been subjected to gel electrophoresis, the part of the gel containing initiation complexes excised, proteins, and DNA eluted and concentrated, and the sample subsequently processed by nuclease digestion, SDS-PAGE and autoradiography as for Fig. 1. Cross-links of RNAP subunits to the non-transcribed (Fig. 3A) and transcribed (Fig. 3B) strands were essentially unchanged relative to Fig. 1, as expected. Cross-links to the transcription factors, which could now be specifically assigned to initiation complexes, were generally similar to those observed in the absence of fractionation, but with some significant differences: the relative intensity of cross-links to TFB1 on the T strand was somewhat reduced downstream of bp -3; the intensity of T strand cross-links to TFB1 between bp -23 and -7 was more uniform than before; the NT strand cross-links to TBP at bp -23 was relatively prominent. Variations of efficiency of cross-linking may in part reflect the manipulative complexity of this experiment and, potentially, differential effects of derivatization with APB on formation of TBP-TFB1 and TBP-TFB1-RNAP complexes. However, the principal and clear-cut outcome of the experiment is the observation that TFB1 in RNA polymerase-containing initiation complexes is accessible to cross-linking from both strands of a promoter segment that extends nearly to the transcriptional start site. The relationship of cross-linking efficiency in TFB1-TBP-DNA complexes and polymerase-containing initiation complexes was explored further by excising transcription factor bands from separation gels and subjecting them to the same analysis. The result of such an experiment with T strand probes for bp -5 to +6 is presented in Fig. 3C. Comparison with Fig. 3B shows that the strongest cross-links to TFB1 in the factors-only complex are with probes -1T and +2T with significant cross-linking to bp +6, whereas the strongest cross-links in the initiation complex are with probe -5T and cross-linking fades out downstream of bp -1. This result indicates that at least some downstream cross-links to TFB1 occur even in the absence of RNAP. It was surprising to find a protein co-migrating with TBP prominently cross-linked to the NT strand far downstream of the TATA box in polymerase-containing transcription complexes (Fig. 3A), near the upstream end of the transcription bubble (24Spitalny P. Thomm M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30497-30505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To investigate this further, transcription initiation complexes were formed with probes -9NT and -7NT, and irradiated; TFB1-TBP-DNA complexes were separated from transcription initiation complexes and analyzed (Fig. 3D). The striking result of this experiment is that relatively efficient cross-linking of the TBP-sized protein to bp -9 of the T strand is specific to polymerase-containing complexes, as is the much weaker cross-linking to bp -7 of the same strand. In contrast, TFB1 is located within cross-linking range of both these sites in the transcription factor and transcription initiation complexes. Most of the cross-links observed in Figs. 1, 2, 3 are consistent with current models for transcription complexes, as discussed below, but some suggest novel/unanticipated (functional) interactions. In particular, it was important to verify that cross-links to the TBP-sized protein at bp -13 to -7 of the NT strand are contributed by specifically assembled complexes, since they are not compatible with the structure of the Pfu TBP-TFB1-TATA DNA complex (regarded as static). The numerous and strong cross-links to TFB1 between the TATA box and the transcription start site could also indicate mechanistically important interactions in initiation of transcription and had to be verified. To examine specificity further, we used a derivative of the gdh promoter with two TATA box mutations (Fig. 4A) that inactivate the promoter (16Bartlett M.S. Thomm M. Geiduschek E.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 782-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), presumably by preventing TBP binding and transcription complex assembly. DNA cross-linking with wild-type and TATA mutant promoters AP-derivatized at several positions between bp -35 and +19 was examined (Fig. 4B). Cross-links to RNAP subunits and transcription factors generally required an intact TATA box, specifying that these cross-links arise from specific and correctly assembled transcription complexes. Only two exceptions were apparent: 1) the cross-link to RNAP subunit B at bp -35 was found to be independent of the TATA box, and not correlated with TFB1 or TBP cross-linking, suggesting that this signal is due to misassembled RNAP, possibly residual factor-independent polymerase binding to the upstream end of the probe; 2) weak cross-links to TFB1 and RNAP subunit B (relative to A″) at bp +12 of the T strand were also seen to be at least partly independent of the TATA box. It should be noted that this experiment was done without nonspecific or specific competitors present; the nonspecific cross-links at bp +12 of the T strand may disappear under more stringent conditions. In the course of our experiments we observed that the Pfu gdh promoter is recognized by purified transcription factors and RNAP from M. thermolithotrophicus (Mth) and M. jannaschii (Mja) (Fig. 5A). 2C. Hethke and M. Thomm, unpublished results. Transcription with the Mth and Mja factors and RNAPs was less efficient than with Pfu RNAP and factors under the conditions used, but transcription start sites were seen to be identical (Fig. 5A). We examined cross-linking of Mth and Mja transcription factors and RNAP using cross-linking probes derivatized at numerous positions in the gdh promoter, in several experiments that were carried out in the absence of competitors. Data for selected probes are shown in Fig. 5B. Subunit B is split in the Methanococcaceae, B″ corresponding approximately to the N-terminal half of Pfu subunit B, and B′ approximately to the C-terminal half. Mth and Mja RNAP subunit A′ was cross-linked by probe +4T, while A″ was cross-linked by probes +4T as well as +16NT. (Mja subunit A″ and TFB are of similar size and mobility, making these two proteins difficult to distinguish on the gel). Subunit B″ was cross-linked by all the probes shown with variable efficiency, while B′ was cross-linked at bp -7 and +4 of the T strand. TBP cross-linked at the TATA box (probe -29T), and TFB cross-linked upstream as well as downstream of the TATA box. Numerous experiments ("
https://openalex.org/W2156050324,"The nervous system must observe a complex world and produce appropriate, sometimes complex, behavioral responses. In contrast to this complexity, neural responses are often characterized through very simple descriptions such as receptive fields or tuning curves. Do these characterizations adequately reflect the true dimensionality reduction that takes place in the nervous system, or are they merely convenient oversimplifications? Here we address this question for the target-selective descending neurons (TSDNs) of the dragonfly. Using extracellular multielectrode recordings of a population of TSDNs, we quantify the completeness of the receptive field description of these cells and conclude that the information in independent instantaneous position and velocity receptive fields accounts for 70%-90% of the total information in single spikes. Thus, we demonstrate that this simple receptive field model is close to a complete description of the features in the stimulus that evoke TSDN response."
https://openalex.org/W2087901269,"To examine the role of the estrogen response element (ERE) sequence in binding of liganded estrogen receptor (ER) to promoters, we analyzed <i>in vivo</i> interaction of liganded ER with the imperfect ERE in the <i>pS2</i> gene and the composite estrogen-responsive unit (ERU) in the proteinase inhibitor 9 (PI-9) gene. In transient transfections of ER-positive HepG2-ER7 cells, PI-9 was strongly induced by estrogen, moxestrol (MOX), and 4-hydroxytamoxifen (OHT). PI-9 was not induced by raloxifene or ICI 182,780. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR showed that moxestrol strongly induced cellular PI-9 and pS2 mRNAs, whereas OHT moderately induced PI-9 mRNA and weakly induced pS2 mRNA. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated strong and similar association of 17β-estradiol-hERα and MOX-hERα with the PI-9 ERU and with the pS2 ERE. Binding of MOX-hERα to the PI-9 ERU and the pS2 ERE was rapid and continuous. Although MOX-hERα bound strongly to the PI-9 ERU and less well to the pS2 ERE in chromatin immunoprecipitation, gel shift assays showed that estrogen-hERα binds with higher affinity to the deproteinized pS2 ERE than to the PI-9 ERU. Across a broad range of OHT concentrations, OHT-hERα associated strongly with the pS2 ERE and weakly with the PI-9 ERU. ICI-hERα bound poorly to the PI-9 ERU and effectively to the pS2 ERE. Raloxifene-hERα and MOX-hERα exhibited similar binding to the PI-9 ERU and the pS2 ERE. These studies demonstrate that ER ligand and ERE sequence work together to regulate <i>in vivo</i> binding of ER to estrogen-responsive promoters."
https://openalex.org/W2117501766,"The reaction mechanism of the esterase 2 (EST2) from Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius was studied at the kinetic and structural level to shed light on the mechanism of activity and substrate specificity increase previously observed in its double mutant M211S/R215L. In particular, the values of kinetic constants (k1, k(-1), k2, and k3) along with activation energies (E1, E(-1), E2, and E3) were measured for wild type and mutant enzyme. The previously suggested substrate-induced switch in the reaction mechanism from kcat=k3 with a short acyl chain substrate (p-nitrophenyl hexanoate) to kcat=k2 with a long acyl chain substrate (p-nitrophenyl dodecanoate) was validated. The inhibition afforded by an irreversible inhibitor (1-hexadecanesulfonyl chloride), structurally related to p-nitrophenyl dodecanoate, was studied by kinetic analysis. Moreover the three-dimensional structure of the double mutant bound to this inhibitor was determined, providing essential information on the enzyme mechanism. In fact, structural analysis explained the observed substrate-induced switch because of an inversion in the binding mode of the long acyl chain derivatives with respect to the acyl- and alcohol-binding sites."
https://openalex.org/W2133010156,"Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptor 3 (TRAIL-R3) is a decoy receptor for TRAIL, a member of the tumor necrosis factor family. In several cell types decoy receptors inhibit TRAIL-induced apoptosis by binding TRAIL and thus preventing its binding to proapoptotic TRAIL receptors. We studied the regulation of TRAIL-R3 gene expression in breast tumor cells treated with the genotoxic drug doxorubicin (DXR). The breast tumor cell line MCF-7 (p53 wild type) responded to DXR with a marked elevation of TRAIL-R3 expression at the mRNA, total protein, and cell surface levels. In contrast, in EVSA-T cells (p53 mutant) DXR did not induce increased expression of TRAIL-R3. In MCF-7 cells overexpressing the human papillomavirus protein E6, which causes p53 degradation, DXR-induced TRAIL-R3 expression was notably reduced. Furthermore, in MCF-7 cells overexpressing a temperature-sensitive p53 mutant (Val135), shifting the cultures to the permissive temperature was sufficient to induce the expression of TRAIL-R3. We also cloned and characterized a p53 consensus element located within the first intron of the human TRAIL-R3 gene. This element binds p53 and confers responsiveness to genotoxic damage to constructs of the TRAIL-R3 promoter in transient transfection experiments. Our results indicate that genotoxic treatments such as DXR, frequently used in cancer therapy, may also induce genes such as TRAIL-R3 that potentially have antiapoptotic actions and thus interfere with the TRAIL signaling system.

Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 66-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). A definitive demonstration of the antiapoptotic action of TRAIL-R3 in apoptosis induced by TRAIL thus requires further studies. The TRAIL-R3 gene maps to human chromosome 8p22-21, clustered with the genes encoding TRAIL-R1, -R2 (8Degli-Esposti M.A. Smolak P.J. Walczak H. Waugh J. Huang C.P. DuBose R.F. Goodwin R.G. Smith C.A.

The first exon encodes the 5′ untranslated region and the first 60 amino acid residues of the open reading frame. Exon II codes for the next 35 amino acids, from position 61 to 95, and includes the predicted signal peptide cleavage site (8Degli-Esposti M.A. Smolak P.J. Walczak H. Waugh J. Huang C.P. DuBose R.F. Goodwin R.G. Smith C.A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1165-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). Exons III and IV encode the two cysteine-rich domains characteristic of the TNF receptor family. The rest of the protein is encoded by exon V. This region contains the extreme carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic region, the 88-amino acid linker sequence, and the 3′ untranslated region. Tissue and cellular distribution of TRAIL-R3 transcripts seems to be more restricted compared with the other TRAIL receptors (8Degli-Esposti M.A. Smolak P.J. Walczak H. Waugh J. Huang C.P.

Its transcripts have been detected in some normal tissues, and they can also be observed in most transformed cell lines but in substantially lower amounts. However, very little is known about the regulation of TRAIL-R3 expression. Overexpression of c-Rel or activation of endogenous Rel/NF-κB factors by TNF-α have been reported to up-regulate TRAIL-R3 expression and confer resistance to TRAIL-induced apoptosis (11Bernard D. Quatannens B. Vandenbunder B. Abbadie C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27322-27328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). TRAIL-R3 is also induced by genotoxic agents in a p53-dependent manner and is overexpressed in primary tumors of the gastrointestinal tract (14Sheikh M.S. Huang Y. Fernandez-Salas E.A. El-Deiry W.S.

These findings give urgency to understanding the mechanisms controlling the transcriptional regulation of TRAIL-R3 expression in tumor cells because treatments that elevate its levels may dampen the potential effectiveness of TRAIL-based therapies. By using nested PCR we recently cloned the promoter region of the TRAIL-R3 gene (15Ruiz de Almodóvar C. López-Rivas A. Redondo J.M. Rodríguez A. FEBS Lett. 2002; 531: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), which contains a consensus TATA box sequence as well as potential binding sites for several transcription factors. However, despite being a p53-regulated gene, no p53 consensus binding site is located within the described promoter region (15Ruiz de Almodóvar C. López-Rivas A. Redondo J.M. Rodríguez A. FEBS Lett. 2002; 531: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The proapoptotic receptors CD95 and TRAIL-R2 are also up-regulated by p53 after genotoxic damage in various cell types (16Sheikh M.S. Burns T.F. Huang Y. Wu G.S. Amundson S. Brooks K.S.

In the CD95 and TRAIL-R2 genes, the p53 consensus element responsible for the observed up-regulation is located within the first intron of the gene (18Muller M. Wilder S. Bannasch D. Israeli D.

In this report, we describe the expression levels of TRAIL receptors in breast cancer cells before and after genotoxic treatment with doxorubicin (DXR), a commonly used drug in breast cancer therapy. Our results revealed a p53-dependent elevation of TRAIL-R1, -R2, and -R3 receptors in these cells. We also identified a p53 consensus element within the first intron of the TRAIL-R3 gene, which is involved in the observed up-regulation of expression upon genotoxic treatment. Reagents and Antibodies—RPMI 1640 medium and fetal bovine serum were obtained from Invitrogen. DXR was from Sigma Immunochemicals. Anti-human TRAIL receptor antibodies for Western blots were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Anti-human TRAIL receptor antibodies for flow cytometry studies were from Alexis Corp. (San Diego, CA). Anti-human p53 and p21 antibodies were purchased from Calbiochem and Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), respectively. All restriction enzymes were from Roche Applied Science. T4 DNA ligase was purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Cell Lines—The human tumor cell lines MCF-7 and EVSA-T were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and 40 μg/ml gentamycin at 37 °C in a humidified 5%CO2, 95% air incubator. MCF-7 cells stably expressing the human papillomavirus type 16 E6 protein or the temperature-sensitive p53 mutant p53Val135were previously generated in our laboratory and maintained in culture as described previously (17Ruiz-Ruiz M.C. López-Rivas A. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 271-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Reverse Transcriptase and PCR Assays—Total RNA was isolated from MCF-7 cells with the TRIzol RNA isolation system (Invitrogen) as recommended by the supplier. cDNAs were synthesized from 2 μg of total RNA using a reverse transcriptase PCR kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with the supplied oligo(dT) primer under conditions described by the manufacturer. PCRs were performed using the following primers: hTRAIL sense, 5′-CAACTCCGTCAGCTCGTTAGAAAG-3′, and hTRAIL antisense, 5′-TTAGACCAACAACTATTTCTAGCACT-3′; hTRAIL-R1 sense, 5′-CTGAGCAACGCAGACTCGCTGTCCAC-3′, and hTRAIL-R1 antisense, 5′-TCCAAGGACACGGCAGAGCCTGTGCCAT-3′; hTRAIL-R2 sense, 5′-GCCTCATGGACAATGAGATAAAGTGGCT-3′, and hTRAIL-R2 antisense, 5′-CCAAATCTCAAAGTACGCACAAACGG-3′; hTRAIL-R3 sense, 5′-GAAGAATTTGGTGCCAATGCCACTG-3′, and hTRAIL-R3 antisense, 5′-CTCTTGGACTTGGCTGGGAGATGTG-3′; hTRAIL-R4 sense, 5′-CTTTTCCGGCGGCGTTCATGTCCTTC-3′, and hTRAIL-R4 antisense, 5′-GTTTCTTCCAGGCTGCTTCCCTTTGTAG-3′; human β-actin sense, 5′-TGACGGGGTCACCCACACTGTGCCCTTC-3′, and human β-actin antisense, 5′-CTAGAAGCATTTGCGGTGGACGATGGAGGG-3′, whose products were 443, 506, 502, 612, 453, and 661 bp long, respectively. Cycle conditions for all the PCRs were 1 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C. The number of cycles varied depending on the TRAIL receptor analyzed. The products were resolved on a 1% agarose gel and visualized with ethidium bromide. Flow Cytometry—To detect TRAIL receptors at the cell surface, control cells or cells treated with DXR (500 ng/ml, 15 h) were detached with RPMI 1640 medium, 3 mm EDTA, washed with PBS, and suspended in 200 μl of PBS. Cells were incubated with primary antibodies (5 μg/ml) at 4 °C for 30 min. After washing with PBS to remove unbound primary antibody, cells were incubated with rabbit anti-mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibody (Dako) (dilution 1:20) for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were then washed again with PBS, suspended in 200 μl of PBS, and analyzed in a FACScan flow cytometer using the Cell Quest software (BD Biosciences). Immunoblot Detection of Proteins—After detachment with trypsin, 0.25% EDTA or PBS, 3 mm EDTA, cells (3 × 105) were washed with PBS, and protein content was measured before lysing the cells in Laemmli sample buffer under reducing conditions. Cell lysates were sonicated, and proteins were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and detected as described previously (17Ruiz-Ruiz M.C. López-Rivas A. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 271-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Plasmid Constructs—Wild-type and mutant versions of the TRAIL-R3 intronic p53-binding site were generated by annealing the corresponding synthetic complementary oligonucleotides. The double-stranded oligonucleotides had overhang ends to direct their cloning between BamHI (5′ end) and HindIII (3′ end) restriction sites (italic residues in oligonucleotide sequences indicate the restriction enzyme sites). The sequences of the oligonucleotides used were: 5′-GATCCCGGCCGGGCATGTCCGGGCAGGACGAACTCA-3′ and 5′-AGCTTGAGTTCGTCCTGCCCGGACATGCCCGGCCGG-3′ for wtp53-BS and 5′-GATCCCGGCCGGGAAAATCCGGGAAAAACGAACTCA-3′ and 5′-AGCTTGAGTTCGTTTTTCCCGGATTTTCCCGGCCGG-3′ for mutp53-BS. For the annealing reaction each pair of complementary primers was mixed at a final concentration of 25 μm, each in an annealing buffer containing 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The annealing mixture was incubated at 90 °C for 4 min, and the reaction mixture was allowed to cool down to room temperature. pIBS-506Luc and pmIBS-506Luc constructs, which respectively contain the wtp53-BS and mutp53-BS upstream of a 506-bp portion of the TRAIL promoter, were generated from the TRAIL-R3 promoter reporter plasmid (p-1641luc) described previously (15Ruiz de Almodóvar C. López-Rivas A. Redondo J.M. Rodríguez A. FEBS Lett. 2002; 531: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). p-1641luc was digested with BamHI and HindIII to release a 1135-bp fragment of the TRAIL-R3 promoter, which was replaced by either the wt or mutant p53-binding site. The p506Luc construct was obtained by filling BamHI and HindIII ends with Klenow and religating the blunted ends. To generate the pTR3Luc reporter plasmid, which includes the intronic p53-binding site in its native genomic context, PCR with Klen-Taq-LA polymerase mixture (Clontech) was used to amplify a 976-bp fragment of the TRAIL-R3 gene containing 533 bp of the promoter, all of exon I, and the first 181 bp of the first intron, which span the p53-binding site. The following combination of primers were used for this: sense, 5′-GGGGGATCCGAGGGATACCAAGCCC-3′, and antisense, 5′-GGGAAGCTTGTCCCTCCTGCCCAGCC-3′. The PCR product was cloned directly into the pGEM-T vector (Promega). A 949-bp fragment was released from this construct by HindIII digestion and finally cloned into a HindIII-digested pXP2 plasmid. A QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used to obtain the pmTR3Luc construct following the manufacturer's instructions. The mutation (underlined nucleotides) was generated with the following oligonucleotides: sense, 5′-CTGCGGCCGGGGGGGTCCGGGCAGG-3′; and antisense, 5′-CCTGCCGGACCCCCCCGGCCGCAG-3′. This construct was sequenced to confirm the expected mutation. pC53-SN3 and pC53-SCX3 plasmids, encoding wt p53 and an Ala143 mutant p53, respectively, were generously provided by Dr. M. Oren (Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel). Transient Transfection and Reporter Activity Assay—Transient transfection experiments were conducted in MCF-7 cells with the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) as indicated by the manufacturer. Briefly 2 × 105 cells/well were seeded into 6-well plates the day before transfection. 0.75 μg of luciferase reporter plasmid and 0.25 μg of β-galactosidase plasmid were mixed with the FuGENE 6 reagent and added to each well. Twelve hours after transfection cells were treated with DXR (500 ng/ml) for 15 h. For co-transfection with wild-type or mutant p53 plasmids, 0.5 μg of luciferase reporter plasmid, 0.25 μg of p53 expression plasmid, and 0.25 μg of β-galactosidase plasmid were mixed with the FuGENE 6 reagent, and cells were incubated with the transfection mixture for 36 h. After incubation, cells were harvested, and luciferase activity was measured according to the instructions of the luciferase system kit (Promega). Transfection efficiency was normalized by measuring the β-galactosidase activity. Transfection experiments were performed in triplicate. Electrophorectic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSAs)—For nuclear protein extractions, MCF-7 cells were treated with DXR (500 ng/ml) for 6 h. Cells were lysed in 400 μl of hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm Na2MoO4, protease inhibitors, 0.75 mm spermidine, and 0.15 mm spermine) containing 0.6% Nonidet P-40. Nuclei were then centrifuged and washed once with a detergent-free hypotonic buffer and incubated in 50 μl of high salt-containing buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 400 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm Na2MoO4, and protease inhibitors) for 30 min on a rocking platform at 4 °C. Nuclei were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge for 10 min, and supernatants containing the nuclear extracts were immediately stored at –80 °C. The protein concentration was quantified by the Bradford procedure. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed as described previously(20Lorenzo E. Ruiz-Ruiz C. Quesada A.J. Hernandez G. Rodríguez A. López-Rivas A. Redondo J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10883-10892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Nuclear proteins (4 μg) were incubated with 2.0 μg of poly(dI-dC) DNA carrier and 4 μl of 5× DNA binding buffer (10% polyvinyl ethanol, 12.5% (v/v) glycerol, 50 mm Tris (pH 8), 2.5 mm EDTA, and 2.5 mm dithiothreitol) in a final volume of 20 μl for 10 min on ice. Next 2 μl (5 × 104 cpm/μl) of 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide was added to the reaction mixture, which was then incubated at room temperature for 30 min. For competition assays, a 100 m excess of unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide was added to the cellular extract prior to the addition of the 32P-labeled probe. When indicated, 100 ng of the anti-p53 antibody (pAb421, Calbiochem) or a control antibody (identical isotype) was added to the cellular extract prior to the 32P-labeled probe. The sequences (5′ to 3′) of the oligonucleotides used in these studies (corresponding to the p53 sequence located within the first intron of the human TRAIL-R3 gene) were as follows: gatccCGGCCGGGCATGTCCGGGCAGGACGAACTCa (sense) and agcttGAGTTCGTCCTGCCCGGACATGCCCGGCCGg (antisense). Up-regulation of TRAIL Receptors in Breast Tumor Cells Treated with DXR—To increase the sensitivity of cancer cells to TRAIL, different DNA-damaging treatments have been used (21Chinnaiyan A.M.

The synergism observed between TRAIL and DNA-damaging agents in the induction of apoptosis is likely to be the result of p53-dependent up-regulation of proapoptotic TRAIL receptors (21Chinnaiyan A.M.

We have analyzed the expression of the TRAIL decoy receptor TRAIL-R3 (also known as DcR1) in the breast tumor cell line MCF-7 and its regulation by genotoxic stress. Treatment of MCF-7 cells with DXR resulted in the up-regulation of proapoptotic TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2 mRNA expression (Fig. 1A). In these cells, expression of decoy receptor TRAIL-R3 mRNA was also markedly increased by DXR treatment (Fig. 1A). Similar results were obtained using the anti-metabolite drug methotrexate as the genotoxic agent (not shown). By contrast, TRAIL and decoy receptor TRAIL-R4 mRNAs, which are expressed in MCF-7 cells prior to treatment with DXR, were not up-regulated after this treatment (Fig. 1A). These results were consistent with the altered protein levels at the cell surface of treated cells detected by flow cytometry. Fig. 1B shows that DXR treatment slightly increased the expression of TRAIL-R1. TRAIL-R2 was expressed in untreated cells, and its expression was further elevated by DXR (Fig. 1B), confirming the results reported by other authors in various cell types (16Sheikh M.S. Burns T.F. Huang Y. Wu G.S. Amundson S. Brooks K.S. Fornace Jr., A.J. El-Deiry W.S. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1593-1598PubMed Google Scholar). Of the decoy receptors, TRAIL-R4 was expressed at the cell surface of MCF-7 cells prior to treatment, and its expression levels did not change after incubation with DXR. By contrast, TRAIL-R3 protein could not be detected by flow cytometry at the cell surface of untreated MCF-7 cells, but its expression was markedly increased upon treatment (Fig. 1B). Elevated TRAIL-R3 Expression Induced by DXR in Breast Tumor Cells Is Dependent on p53—It has been reported that the tumor suppressor protein p53, which participates in the cellular response to DNA damage, is involved in the up-regulation of the expression of several apoptosis-related genes, including death receptors (25Vousden K.H. Lu X. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 594-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (2728) Google Scholar). To address the role of p53 in DXR-induced TRAIL receptor up-regulation in breast tumor cells, we compared the expression levels of TRAIL receptors in breast tumor MCF-7 (wild-type p53) and EVSA-T (inactive mutant p53) cells before and after treatment with DXR. We also analyzed the effect of DXR in these cell lines on the accumulation of p53 and the expression of WAF1/p21, a protein whose gene is regulated by p53 (26Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6740) Google Scholar). Fig. 2A shows that in MCF-7 cells, the p53 level was low in untreated cultures and was markedly elevated after drug treatment. By contrast, untreated EVSA-T cells showed a high level of p53 expression, and there was only a small increase after treatment. Consistent with this, the expression of WAF1/p21 was up-regulated by DXR treatment in only MCF-7 cells, confirming that p53 expressed in EVSA-T cells is transcriptionally inactive. The results shown in Fig. 2A demonstrate that contrary to the findings in MCF-7 cells, DXR failed to elevate the expression of TRAIL-R1, -R2, or -R3 in EVSA-T cells. These results suggest that p53 may be required for the up-regulation of TRAIL receptors in response to genotoxic stress. To confirm this we used MCF-7 cells that express the human papillomavirus type 16 E6 protein (17Ruiz-Ruiz M.C. López-Rivas A. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 271-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Overexpression of E6 protein causes the degradation of p53 via the proteasome pathway and thus prevents the transcriptional activation of p53 target genes (27Kessis T.D. Slebos R.J. Nelson W.G. Kastan M.B. Plunkett B.S. Han S.M. Lorincz A.T. Hedrick L. Cho K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3988-3992Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). We have previously reported that overexpression of E6 protein in MCF-7 cells prevents the up-regulation of CD95/Fas receptor that takes place in response to genotoxic stress (28Ruiz-Ruiz C. Robledo G. Cano E. Redondo J.M. López-Rivas A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31667-31675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) As shown in Fig. 2B, MCF-7E6 cells failed to accumulate p53 in response to DXR treatment and showed a complete absence of TRAIL-R3 upregulation. Likewise up-regulation of TRAIL-R1 and -R2 by DXR was abrogated, and we also observed a markedly lower induction of WAF1/p21 in MCF-7E6 cells when compared with MCF-7neo (control) cells. The data presented so far indicated that p53 accumulation is a necessary event for the up-regulation of TRAIL-R1, -R2, and -R3 expression in breast tumor cells treated with DXR. This prompted us to examine whether accumulation of active p53 was sufficient to elevate TRAIL receptor expression in MCF-7 cells. For this we used MCF-7 cells stably expressing a temperature-sensitive mutant of mouse p53 (Val135) (17Ruiz-Ruiz M.C. López-Rivas A. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 271-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Shifting the cells from the restrictive temperature (37–38 °C), at which the protein adopts an inactive conformation, to a lower temperature (32 °C) triggers the adoption of an active wild-type conformation (29Michalovitz D. Halevy O. Oren M. Cell. 1990; 62: 671-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar) capable of inducing the expression of the p53-regulated gene WAF1/p21 (Fig. 2C). Fig. 2C shows that control (puro) cells did not express TRAIL-R3 protein at either temperature. By contrast, TRAIL-R3 protein expression, which was low in MCF-7p53ts cells maintained at 37 °C, was notably elevated after incubation at the permissive temperature for 48 h. Similar results were obtained when the proapoptotic receptors TRAIL-R1 and -R2 were analyzed (Fig. 2C).

The structure will form a basis for future mechanistic and structural studies, as well as engineering aimed at production of alternative β-amino acids. An important mechanism of bacterial resistance to β-lactam antibiotics involves β-lactamase-catalyzed hydrolysis of the β-lactam ring, resulting in biologically inactive products (1Matagne A. Dubus A. Galleni M. Frère J.-M. Nat. Prod. Rep. 1999; 16: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Clavulanic acid (Fig. 1), one of many β-lactams produced by Streptomyces clavuligerus, is the most widely used inhibitor of the serine β-lactamases, and is clinically administered in combination with the penicillin amoxycillin (2Jensen S.E. Paradkar A.S. Antonie Leeuwenhoek Int. J. Gen. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 75: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 3Baggaley K.H. Brown A.G. Schofield C.J. Nat. Prod. Rep. 1997; 14: 309-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Clavulanic acid is itself a bicyclic β-lactam, and reacts with the β-lactamases to form stable acyl-enzyme complexes (4Brown R.P. Aplin R.T. Schofield C.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12421-12432Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 5Knowles J.R. Acc. Chem. Res. 1985; 18: 97-104Crossref Scopus (222) Google Scholar). A commercially viable synthesis of clavulanic acid is rendered difficult by the high lability and density of functionalization around the bicyclic core (3Baggaley K.H. Brown A.G. Schofield C.J. Nat.

Consequently clavulanic acid is produced by fermentation and there is considerable interest in its biosynthetic pathway. A total of 18 genes from the genome of S. clavuligerus have thus far been implicated in clavulanic acid biosynthesis (7Mellado E. Lorenzana L.M. Rodriguez-Saiz M. Diez B. Liras P. Barredo J.L.

N2-(2-Carboxyethyl)arginine synthase (CEAS) is the enzyme product of the first gene in the clavulanic acid cluster, orf2. It catalyzes the first step in the clavulanic acid pathway, the condensation of l-arginine and a three-carbon precursor to give N2-(2-carboxyethyl)arginine (Fig. 1). On the basis of turnover experiments with a variety of potential three carbon precursors the best substrate identified was d-glyceraldehyde 3-P (12Khaleeli N. Li R. Townsend C.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 9223-9224Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis indicated the presence of a conserved thiamin diphosphate (ThP2) binding fold, and indeed, CEAS catalysis has been shown to be dependent on ThP2 (12Khaleeli N. Li R. Townsend C.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 9223-9224Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar). ThP2-dependent enzymes generally employ the cofactor both to effect nucleophilic attack at a carbonyl group and to stabilize the carbanion subsequently formed by proton transfer or decarboxylation. The reactions catalyzed by ThP2 enzymes may be subclassified as either non-oxidative, such as those of yeast pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC) (23Jordan F. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2003; 20: 184-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) and benzoylformate decarboxylase (24Hasson M.S. Muscate A. McLeish M.J. Polovnikova L.S. Gerlt J.A. Kenyon G.L. Petsko G.A. Ringe D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9918-9930Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), or oxidative, such as those of pyruvate oxidase (25Muller Y.A. Schulz G.E. Science. 1993; 259: 965-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 26Bertagnolli B.L. Hager L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10168-10173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, several ThP2 enzymes that catalyze atypical reactions have been identified, including CEAS and 2-hydroxyphytanoylcoenzyme A lyase, an enzyme involved in the degradation of phytanic acid that is derived from the side chain of chlorophyll (27Foulon V. Antonenkov V.D. Croes K. Waelkens E. Mannaerts G.P. Van Veldhoven P.P. Casteels M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10039-10044Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In addition to its key role in clavam biosynthesis, CEAS is of mechanistic interest due to the unprecedented manner in which a ThP2-dependent enzyme is used in a N-C bond forming reaction, proposed to proceed via an α,β-unsaturated acyl-ThP2 intermediate. Here we report the crystal structure of CEAS complexed with ThP2 and Mg2+, and discuss the mechanistic implications arising. Protein Expression and Purification—The ceas gene was PCR amplified and subcloned directly as an NdeI/BamHI fragment into the pET24a(+) vector (Novagen). Primers used were: forward, 5′-acgctcatatgtcccgtgta-3′; reverse, 5′-ggacatgagcggtctcccgactccgtcagtacc-3′. Following amplification, the integrity of ceas was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The ceas/pET24a(+) construct was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) and grown at 37 °C in 2TY medium containing 30 μg/ml kanamycin. Protein production was induced at an A600 of 0.8 by addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1.0 mm, following reduction of the temperature to 30 °C. CEAS was purified by sequential use of Q-Sepharose and phenyl-Resource chromatography. Size exclusion chromatography (Superdex S200) was used as a final step to yield CEAS of >95% purity by SDS-PAGE analysis. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) revealed that the mass of the isolated CEAS was consistent with loss of N-terminal methionine from the predicted amino acid sequence (observed, 60,776 Da; calculated without N-terminal methionine, 60,776 Da). N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis (observed, SRVSTAPSGK) confirmed the identity of the protein and the loss of the N-terminal methionine. The activity of purified CEAS was confirmed by high performance liquid chromatography assay and comparison with known synthetic standards. Selenomethionine-substituted Protein Expression—Selenomethionine-substituted CEAS was produced using a metabolic inhibition protocol and LeMaster media supplemented with 50 mg/liter l-selenomethionine. Selenomethionine incorporation was >95% by ESI-MS. Native Molecular Weight Determination—The “native” molecular weight of CEAS was determined by size exclusion chromatography (Superdex 200 HR). Calibration was carried out using cytochrome c (12 kDa), chymotrypsin (25 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), and blue dextran (2000 kDa) (Gel Filtration Calibration kit, Amersham Biosciences). An elution volume parameter (Kav) was calculated for each of the calibration proteins and a calibration curve was constructed. By calculating Kav for CEAS the native molecular weight was established. Crystallization—Crystallization conditions were initially sought by the vapor diffusion method, using commercially available crystallization screens. Hanging drops of 2 μl of protein (10 mg/ml), containing a 3-fold excess of thiamin diphosphate, and 2 μl of well solution were suspended at 17 °C over a well solution containing 1.6 m ammonium sulfate and 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.4. Under these conditions, crystals of two different morphologies grew over a period of 2 weeks. The crystals belonged to two different space groups, however, the shape of the crystals was not a determinant of the space group. The majority of the crystals belonged to space group P212121, with unit cell dimensions a = 117.7 Å, b = 127.3 Å, c = 196.8 Å. The remainder of the crystals belonged to space group P21212, with unit cell dimensions a = 123.1 Å, b = 187.2 Å, c = 198.6 Å. Crystallographic Data Collection and Structure Solution—Crystals were cryocooled by plunging into liquid nitrogen and x-ray data were collected at 100 K using a nitrogen stream. Cryoprotection was accomplished by sequential transfer into solutions of 1.8 m ammonium sulfate, containing 10% (v/v) glycerol and 25% glycerol. Data from selenomethionine-substituted crystals was collected on beamline BM14 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble, France, using a MarCCD detector. All other data were collected on beamlines 14.1 and 14.2 of the Synchrotron Radiation Source, Daresbury, UK. The data were processed using MOSFLM (28Leslie A.G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1696-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar) and the CCP4 suite of programs (29Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). The selenomethionine-substituted crystal used for the structure solution belonged to the P212121 space group. Using SHELXD (30Schneider T.R. Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 54: 1772-1779Crossref Scopus (1580) Google Scholar), 40 selenium positions were determined, corresponding to four molecules per asymmetric unit, excluding the N-terminal methionine that was not present by N-terminal sequencing and ESI-MS. Phasing and density modification were performed using CNS (31Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J.

Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). Refinement of this model against the selenomethionine-substituted data (remote wavelength) using a strict non-crystallographic symmetry relationship was performed using CNS. One cycle of simulated annealing followed by grouped B-factor refinement brought the Rfree to 30.5%. 5% of the reflections were excluded for calculation of Rfree. Further rounds of refinement using REFMAC5 (33Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Lebedev A. Wilson K.S. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar), including individual B-factor refinement and the addition of solvent molecules and ThP2 cofactor, brought the conventional R-factor to 15.7% and the Rfree to 19.8%. Non-crystallographic symmetry restraints were used throughout refinement. The current model contains residues 12–572 for all four molecules in the asymmetric unit, excluding residues 182–184 for which the electron density was unclear. In total the final model contains 16,616 non-hydrogen protein atoms out of a theoretical maximum of 17,144. According to Procheck (34Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) there were no Ramachandran outliers. The 2.35-Å native dataset was solved by rigid body refinement using REFMAC5, further rounds of refinement brought the R-factor to 15.7% and the Rfree to 19.5%. The P21212 crystal form was solved by molecular replacement with the 2.35-Å selenomethionine structure using CNS. There were six molecules per asymmetric unit. Refinement of this data was performed using REFMAC5. Figures were prepared with Molscript (35Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar), Bobscript (36Esnouf R.M. J.

Crystallization—Diffraction quality CEAS crystals were obtained in the presence of ThP2, using ammonium sulfate as precipitant, whereas poor quality crystals that did not diffract x-rays were obtained in the absence of ThP2 under a variety of conditions. The useful crystals grew in two morphologies, rods and many-sided polyhedra. The majority of the crystals were of the polyhedral form. The crystals belonged to two different space groups, P212121 and P21212, with differing cell dimensions. Both space groups were observed for the polyhedral-shaped crystals although as yet only the P212121 space group has been observed for the rod-shaped crystals. Structure Solution—The structure of CEAS has been determined to 2.35-Å resolution in the P212121 crystal form using the multiple anomalous dispersion method and the P21212 form was subsequently solved to 2.45-Å resolution by molecular replacement. In both crystal forms a similar tetrameric arrangement of CEAS molecules was observed (Fig. 2). In the P212121 form the tetramer was comprised of the four molecules in the asymmetric unit, whereas the P21212 form contained one tetramer in the asymmetric unit and one dimer that formed a tetramer by association about a crystallographic 2-fold rotation axis. Monomer Structure—Each CEAS subunit consists of three domains, labeled α, β, and γ as in the structure of PDC (Fig. 3) (38Arjunan P. Umland T. Dyda F. Swaminathan S. Furey W. Sax M. Farrenkopf B. Gao Y. Zhang D. Jordan F. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 590-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The overall structure and fold of CEAS is similar to that of PDC (Fig. 4) and is reflected in a root mean square deviation of 1.95 Å over 372 Cα atoms (66% of CEAS residues). The α domain (residues 12–193) is the most similar to its equivalent in PDC (root mean square deviation 1.50 Å over 150 Cα atoms, 83% of CEAS residues in this domain), whereas the β domain (194–376) is the least similar (root mean square deviation 1.63 Å over 109 Cα atoms, 59.9% of CEAS residues). The most substantial difference between the α domains is the complete absence in CEAS of the second α helix of PDC. The lower similarity of the β domains is mainly because of differences at each end of the central β-sheet (Fig. 4). At one end CEAS lacks the inserted antiparallel β-strand of PDC, having a loop over connection between strands β11 and β12 that maintains the parallel nature of the β-sheet, whereas at the other end CEAS both lacks one β-strand and possesses an additional α-helix (α9). The β domain was found to be the most flexible domain of PDC (38Arjunan P. Umland T. Dyda F. Swaminathan S. Furey W. Sax M. Farrenkopf B. Gao Y. Zhang D. Jordan F. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 590-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), which may be connected to the tetrameric rearrangement that occurs with that enzyme (see below). The γ domain of CEAS (377–572), which contains the majority of the residues that bind the ThP2, has a substantially similar backbone arrangement around the active site to that of PDC, with the differences being largely because of differing lengths of secondary structural elements.Fig. 4Comparison of the structures of CEAS (left) and yeast pyruvate decarboxylase (right).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) CEAS has only 16% sequence identity to PDC. However, the relative orientation of the three domains of each is very similar, which is presumably because of the necessity of maintaining such an arrangement to form the tightly bound dimer, essential for composition of the active site. Oligomerization—The observation of a tetramer in the crystal form is in agreement with gel filtration chromatographic analysis, which showed CEAS to exist in two oligomeric solution states. The calculated approximate native molecular masses of 240 and 130 kDa correspond to tetrameric and dimeric forms of CEAS (60,776 Da after N-terminal methionine loss). Relative peak areas suggest that, under the conditions of analysis, these forms exist in approximately equal quantities (Fig. 5). The tetramer consists of two tightly bound dimers (root mean square deviation 0.19 Å over all Cα atoms), which are more loosely bound together to form a tetramer. The tetramer has a size of ∼115 Å on the longest dimension and 60 Å on the shortest. Monomer-monomer contacts occur exclusively between α and γ domains, whereas dimer-dimer contacts to form the tetramer mainly feature the β domain. Internally, each tightly bound dimer buries a surface area of ∼7400 Å2, whereas each monomer buries a surface area of 1950 Å2 with the closest monomer of the other dimer and 460 Å2 with the further monomer. Altogether, the dimer-dimer interaction buries a surface area of ∼4600 Å2. Each dimer is stabilized by a large number of hydrogen bonds. By contrast, there are very few hydrogen bonds at the dimer-dimer interface, although there are a considerable number of crystallographic water molecules located in the sizeable cavity between the dimers, at the center of the tetramer. Whereas these water molecules may provide substantial stabilization, because of the greatly differing surface areas of interaction the tetramer is best described as a dimer of dimers. It is not yet known for CEAS whether large conformational changes occur in the tetramer on substrate binding, as in yeast PDC, where an allosteric substrate activation process takes place involving an approximate 30° movement of the dimers with respect to each other (39Lu G.G. Dobritzsch D. Baumann S. Schneider G. König S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 861-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This rotation is asymmetrical with respect to the tetramer and results in a separation of one pair of β domains, whereas the other pair remain associated much as in the starting tetramer. The assembly of the CEAS tetramer is most similar to that of PDC from Zymomonas mobilis (ZmPDC) (40Dobritzsch D. König S. Schneider G. Lu G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20196-20204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), which does not behave in such a manner and in which the tetramer is symmetrically arranged. By comparison to yeast PDC the dimers of the ZmPDC tetramer are rotated ∼30° with respect to each other, but about the central point of the tetramer. In contrast to yeast PDC, this tetrameric arrangement is much more closely associated, hindering movement, and for ZmPDC has been ascribed as the activated conformation. Based on this comparison it seems likely that CEAS would not undergo tetrameric rearrangement although further investigation will be needed to confirm this supposition. ThP2Binding Site—The ThP2 binding region is situated across two subunits of the closely associated dimer, as with related enzymes such as PDC. The γ domain of one subunit and the α domain of the other subunit contribute to binding, with two ThP2 binding regions per dimer. ThP2 binding is facilitated by a combination of hydrogen bonding and formation of a complex with a single Mg2+ ion. The Mg2+ ion is coordinated octahedrally by the side chains of Asp-463 and Asn-490, the backbone carbonyl of Thr-492, two diphosphate oxygens of ThP2 and a water molecule, also bound to the carbonyl oxygen of Val-488 (Fig. 6). This environment is similar to the characteristic ThP2/Mg2+ binding motif identified as a conserved sequence in all ThP2 enzyme structures (41Hawkins C.F. Borges A. Perham R.N. FEBS Lett. 1989; 255: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). This sequence is found entirely in the γ domain and contributes to the binding of the diphosphate region of the ThP2. Further hydrogen bonding of the diphosphate oxygens occurs directly to the backbone nitrogens of Phe-413, Leu-495, and Gly-465, all from the γ domain. The aminopyrimidine “end” of the ThP2 is associated with non-conserved regions of both the same γ domain, and the α domain of the other monomer in the dimer. It is anchored via hydrogen bonds between N-4′ and the carbonyl oxygen of Ser-43, and between N-1′ and the side chain of Glu-57 of the α domain of the other monomer. The ThP2 cofactor is observed in a “V” conformation (Fig. 6), bent around the hydrophobic side chain of Phe-438. Structural information on other ThP2-dependent enzymes indicates that a single hydrophobic residue is always found in a similar position, possibly aiding distortion of ThP2 into this high potential energy state not normally witnessed outside a protein environment (23Jordan F. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2003; 20: 184-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The type of residue carrying out this function is specific to an individual enzyme, and evidence from mutation studies on yeast PDC suggests that it may have an important effect on mechanism (42Guo F.S. Zhang D.Q. Kahyaoglu A. Farid R.S. Jordan F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13379-13391Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Potential Glyceraldehyde-3-P and Arginine Binding Sites—In all the refined structures, a sulfate anion could be identified in the electron density at a distance of ∼6 Å from the nucleophilic C-2 carbon of ThP2. It is likely that this sulfate occupies the binding position of the phosphate of glyceraldehyde-3-P. The sulfate is bound at one oxygen by the side chains of Arg-414 and His-415, at another by Tyr-271, and at a third by His-120 from the other monomer in the dimer (Fig. 7). The fourth sulfate oxygen is not bound directly to the protein and is located at a distance of 4.8 Å from the nucleophilic C-2 of ThP2. This distance is ideal for a fully extended four-bond link between these two atoms as might be expected from the reaction intermediate formed by ThP2 and glyceraldehyde-3-P (Fig. 8).Fig. 8Proposed outline biosynthetic mechanism of CEAS. Note that the stage at which l-arginine binds and the details of proton transfers and eliminations are uncertain.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A similar phosphate binding site has been identified in the crystal structure of transketolase complexed with erythrose 4-phosphate (43Nilsson U. Meshalkina L. Lindqvist Y. Schneider G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1864-1869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The phosphate is anchored in a pocket of two arginine side chains, a histidine and a serine. The phosphate is bound further from the C-2 of ThP2 than in CEAS, at a distance of ∼9 Å, which fits with the larger size of the substrate over the glyceraldehyde-3-P of CEAS. The structure of yeast acetohydroxyacid synthase also reveals a phosphate bound close to the C-2 of ThP2 (44Pang S.S. Duggleby R.G. Guddat L.W. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 249-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). However, the phosphate ligands differ and the authors propose this as a binding site for the carboxyl group of the pyruvate substrate. The active site cavity surrounding the proposed glyceraldehyde-3-P binding position is largely hydrophobic, containing the side chains of Ile-410 and Leu-495. The exceptions in this region are Gln-121 and Ser-436. It is also possible that, in the presence of substrate, the side chain of Arg-36 would move into a position capable of participating in the reaction. Overall, however, the CEAS active site is remarkable through its apparent lack of polar residues positioned to assist catalysis. By comparison, some of the active site residues with acidic/basic side chains proposed in a functional role in PDC are replaced in CEAS with neutral amino acids, e.g. His-115 by Gln-121, and Glu-477 by Ile-496. It is therefore difficult to assign distinct mechanistic functions to particular residues in the CEAS active site and it appears that CEAS must rely heavily on ThP2 for general acid/base catalysis. Analysis of the external region of the active site channel reveals a number of residues that may facilitate arginine binding. Furthest from the ThP2, Tyr-298 and Asp-113 could potentially bind the positively charged guanidino group. Nearer the proposed phosphate binding site, Arg-303 and Asp-301 may participate in arginine binding. Mechanistic Discussion—In their assignment of the function of CEAS, Khaleeli et al. (12Khaleeli N. Li R. Townsend C.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 9223-9224Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar) proposed an outline mechanism for the condensation of d-glyceraldehyde-3-P with l-arginine, involving initial nucleophilic attack of the ThP2 ylide on the aldehyde of d-glyceraldehyde-3-P. Subsequent elimination and tautomerization then allows loss of the hydroxyl function at the C-2 position. Prior labeling studies imply that addition of arginine to glyceraldehyde-3-P occurs with retention of configuration at C-2 (45McIlwaine D.B. Townsend C.A. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1993; 17: 1346-1347Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 46Basak A. Salowe S.P. Townsend C.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 1654-1656Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar), suggesting an elimination-addition process during formation of the C-N bond. In the final step, the acyl-ThP2 intermediate must be hydrolyzed to release the N2-(2-carboxyethyl)arginine product. The absence of residues capable of general acid/base catalysis at the active site of CEAS suggests that the 4′ amino group of the aminopyrimidine ring of ThP2 plays a key role. The structure shows that the suggested binding/polarizing site for the phosphate of d-glyceraldehyde-3-P could position the aldehyde of this substrate close to the nucleophilic carbon of ThP2. Considerable work on the early stages of ThP2 reaction mechanisms has shown that formation of the “activated” ThP2, by deprotonation at C-2, occurs via an intramolecular proton transfer to the 4′ amino nitrogen of the aminopyrimidine ring (38Arjunan P. Umland T. Dyda F. Swaminathan S. Furey W. Sax M. Farrenkopf B. Gao Y. Zhang D. Jordan F. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 590-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 47Kern D. Kern G. Neef H. Tittmann K. Killenberg-Jabs M. Wikner C. Schneider G. Hubner G. Science. 1997; 275: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The stabilized negative charge at C-2 can then effect a nucleophilic attack on a substrate carbonyl group. Following such a nucleophilic attack by ThP2 at C-1 of glyceraldehyde-3-P (Fig. 8), proton transfer from C to O, via the amino group of ThP2, may occur to give a C-1 anion. Studies on deamino ThP2 analogues have indicated that the 4′ amino group of ThP2 then stabilizes the negatively charged oxygen formed at the α-carbon position (48Schellenberger A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta Protein Struct. 1998; 1385: 177-186Google Scholar, 49Schellenberger A. Chem. Ber. 1990; 123: 1489-1494Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 50Golbik R. Neef H. Hubner G. König S. Seliger B. Meshalkina L. Kochetov G.A. Schellenberger A. Bioorg. Chem. 1991; 19: 10-17Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar), possibly via partial protonation. The proposed role for the 4′-amino group is supported by freeze-quench crystallographic studies on ThP2-substrate adducts with transketolase (51Fiedler E. Thorell S. Sandalova T. Golbik R. König S. Schneider G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 591-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Although the geometry of the adduct does not seem to satisfactorily allow for such stabilization, during transition state formation, the change in hybridization from sp2 to sp3 allows for a more favorable interaction between the oxygen and 4′ amino group. After formation of the enamine/carbanion, two distinct reaction pathways appear to occur in the mechanisms of most ThP2-dependent enzymes: either the enamine/carbanion is protonated, as in PDC, or it is not, such as in transketolase, where it reacts with another substrate molecule. This fundamental difference in mechanism is reliant on the presence of a proton donor close to the enamine/carbanion position. In PDC, the Glu-477 residue has been shown to fulfill this function, via a bridging water molecule (52Lobell M. Crout D.H.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 1867-1873Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In benzoylformate decarboxylase, His-281 has been shown to perform the same role, possibly with the aid of Ser-26 (53Polovnikova E.S. McLeish M.J. Sergienko E.A. Burgner J.T. Anderson N.L. Bera A.K. Jordan F. Kenyon G.L. Hasson M.S. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1820-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). There appears to be no such proton donor present in CEAS where an isoleucine occupies an equivalent position to Glu-477 of PDC. It therefore seems reasonable that with CEAS the carbanion subsequently reacts to eliminate the C-2 hydroxyl group to give an enol/enolate. The three positively charged residues binding the glyceraldehyde-3-P phosphate are bound to no other negatively charged atom, and the consequent polarization of glyceraldehyde-3-P would promote phosphate elimination. This elimination would give an α,β-unsaturated acyl-ThP2 species, which could act as a Michael acceptor for l-arginine. Possible binding sites for arginine could place the nucleophilic amino group in a suitable position for such an addition. Finally, hydrolysis of the acyl-ThP2 complex would leave the β-amino acid product, N2-(2-carboxyethyl)arginine. Although details of the steps, including proton transfers are uncertain, it seems likely that the aminopyrimidine ring of ThP2 plays a key role in some of the steps, possibly including elimination of both water and phosphate, and addition of arginine.

Anticancer agents induce apoptosis through death receptor- and mitochondria-initiated pathways. The object of this work was to determine the involvement of these pathways in the response to doxorubicin (Dox) and cisplatin (CDDP) in S-type neuroblastoma cells. Both drugs activated caspase-9 and caspase-3 but not caspase-8. Caspase-9-specific inhibition blocked S-type cell death induced by Dox. SH-EP1 cells transfected to express dominant negative mutant caspase-9, but not those expressing DN caspase-8, were resistant to Dox- and CDDP-induced apoptosis. The lack of caspase-8 involvement in chemotherapy-induced death was not the result of an intrinsic inability of these cells to activate this enzyme because when they were treated with tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand, caspase-8 was activated. We also found that both drugs up-regulated CD95/Fas expression but that CD95/Fas signaling was not necessary for cell killing. Experiments testing the response of chemotherapy-treated cells to agonists of the CD95/Fas receptor established that Dox and CDDP treatment sensitizes cells to CD95/Fas killing. Together, these results are consistent with a model in which caspase-9 is of central importance in the death mechanism utilized by these drugs in S-type cells. Although the death response is not dependent on CD95/Fas, concomitant stimulation of this receptor amplifies the death response in drug-treated cells."

Lack of CDC25A leads to an accumulation of inactive Cdk2 (phosphorylated at Thr-14 and Tyr-15) (10Falck J. Mailand N. Syljuasen R.G. Bartek J. Lukas J.

It is a nuclear serine/threonine protein kinase that is not only involved in the damage checkpoint pathway but is also an essential factor for double-strand break (dsb) repair (also known as non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) repair). It is a three-protein complex consisting of a 460-kDa catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) and two regulatory subunits (Ku70/Ku80 heterodimer). The latter regulates kinase activity upon binding to DNA termini (22Gottlieb T.M. Jackson S.P. Cell. 1993; 72: 131-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). Studies with mouse and human cells defective in DNA-PKcs indicated that DNA-PK is not only necessary for exit from the DNA damage-induced G2 arrest (23Lee S.E. Mitchell R.A. Cheng A. Hendrickson E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1425-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) but is also involved in S phase arrest following DNA damage (24Park J.S. Park S.J. Peng X. Wang M. Yu M.A. Lee S.H. J.

Both DNA-PK and ATM phosphorylate human replication protein A, a key replication/repair factor involved in replication and repair, suggesting a possible role for ATM/DNA-PK in controlling DNA replication following DNA damage, although the functional implication for replication protein A phosphorylation in DNA replication and repair remains unclear (26Shao R.G.

Ku70/Ku80 are the regulatory subunits for DNA-PKcs that preferentially interact with chromosomal breaks following IR, which not only protects DNA ends from nuclease attack but is also essential for double-strand break repair (29Suwa A.

In addition, human Ku complex has been shown to associate physically with telomerase and plays a unique role in telomere maintenance (32Hsu H.L. Gilley D. Blackburn E.H. Chen D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12454-12458Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 33Espejel S. Franco S. Sgura A. Gae D. Bailey S.M. Taccioli G.E. Blasco M.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6275-6287Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated a role for the Ku complex in S phase arrest following IR. We found that mammalian cells lacking Ku80 exhibit a prolonged retardation in S phase progression following DNA damage. This was not directly related to the lack of DNA repair activity in Ku80-/- cells. Instead, the Ku complex binds to chromosomal breaks following IR and prevents a key replication factor, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), from being unloaded from chromatin. In this way, intact replication machinery can be maintained on the chromosome without falling apart, which eventually facilitates cells to resume DNA replication after repair. Cell Cultures—Mouse embryonic fibroblast cells (Ku80-/-, Atm-/-, and DNA-PKcs-/-) (34Wang S. Guo M. Ouyang H. Li X. Cordon-Cardo C. Kurimasa A. Chen D.J. Fuks Z. Ling C.C. Li G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1584-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and HeLa cells were grown in minimum essential medium and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media F-12 (Invitrogen), respectively, which were supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), penicillin (10 unit/ml, Sigma), and streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml, Sigma). For irradiation, cells were grown in 150-mm dishes with 70-80% confluence at the time of irradiation. Tissue culture medium was renewed 1 day prior to irradiation to remove non-viable and unattached cells. A Gammacell-40 exactor (Nordion) containing a 137Cs source was used as a source for ionizing radiation. BrdUrd Tracking Experiment—To analyze S phase progression of wild-type (WT) and mutant cells following IR treatment, cells were pulse-labeled with 10 μm bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) for 1 h, washed twice with PBS, treated with 0-40 Gy of IR, and cultured for the indicated times before harvest. BrdUrd-labeled cells were detected using FITC-conjugated anti-BrdUrd monoclonal antibody (Pharmingen) essentially according to the manufacturer's specifications. Briefly, cells labeled with BrdUrd were trypsinized, fixed in 70% ethanol, treated with 2 m HCl for denaturation, and washed in PBS. After neutralization with 0.1 m sodium borate, cells were resuspended in PBS, 0.5% Tween 20 containing anti-BrdUrd monoclonal antibody and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. After PBS wash, cells were resuspended in propidium iodide (50 μg/ml, Sigma) and analyzed on a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Watson Pragmatic analysis was used to quantify cell cycle distribution of BrdUrd-incorporated cells (35Watson J.V. Chambers S.H. Smith P.J. Cytometry. 1987; 8: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Preparation of Intact Nuclei and Cytosolic Extracts—Cytosolic extracts and intact nuclei were prepared from asynchronously grown WT or mutant murine cells essentially as described previously (36Krude T. Jackman M. Pines J. Laskey R.A. Cell. 1997; 88: 109-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Cells were washed twice with PBS and allowed to swell in 20 ml of ice-cold hypotonic buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.8, 5 mm potassium acetate, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 mm DTT) per 150-mm dish for 10 min. All subsequent steps were carried out at 4 °C. After removal of mitotic cells that detached from the dish under hypotonic conditions, interphase cells were scraped off the plates and disrupted with 25 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer using a loose-fitting pestle. Nuclei were pelleted at 1,500 × g for 3 min, and the supernatant (cytosolic extracts) was collected and recentrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Cytosolic extracts were aliquoted and frozen in liquid N2. Pelleted nuclei, after a brief wash with hypotonic buffer, were resuspended at 1.5 × 108 nuclei/ml in hypotonic buffer. Aliquots were frozen in drops in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C until use. In Vitro Replication with Intact Nuclei—Replication reactions (30 μl) containing cytosolic extracts (300 μg of protein), a buffered mixture of NTPs, dNTPs, an ATP-regenerating system, and 1.0 × 105 nuclei were performed as described previously (36Krude T. Jackman M. Pines J. Laskey R.A. Cell. 1997; 88: 109-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). In vitro DNA replication reactions were incubated at 37 °C in the presence of [α-32P]dATP for 2 h. Two volumes of a stop mixture (1% SDS, 5 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 6.8) were added after the incubation, and aliquots were pipetted onto GFC filters in quadruplicate. Two filters were dried and used to measure total counts, although the other two were trichloroacetic acid-precipitated (10% trichloroacetic acid containing 2% sodium pyrophosphate). By using the ratio of the incorporated radiolabel to the total radiolabel available in the reaction and relating this to the dATP pool, the mass of DNA synthesized was calculated using the formula ((trichloroacetic acid cpm/total cpm) × 0.101 = ng/μl DNA synthesized). In Vivo DNA Synthesis—Rate of DNA synthesis was measured by incorporation of [3H]thymidine into chromosomal DNA as described previously (24Park J.S. Park S.J. Peng X. Wang M. Yu M.A. Lee S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32520-32527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Cells (1 × 105/16-mm diameter well) were incubated with [3H]thymidine (5 μCi/ml; 67 Ci/mmol from ICN) and cold thymidine (0.2 μg/ml) for the indicated times, and metabolism was stopped by the addition of 1/10 volume 2.3 m citric acid. Cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and DNA was precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid at 4 °C for at least 2 h. Trichloroacetic acid-precipitated materials were solubilized in 250 μl of 0.2 m NaOH and transferred to a vial containing 5 ml of scintillation fluid and 10 μl of concentrated acetic acid for radioactivity measurement. Double-strand Break Repair Assay—Kinetics of the rejoining of radiation-induced damaged DNA in cells following exposure to γ irradiation (137Cs) were measured by pulsed field gel electrophoresis. Cells were grown in the presence of 2.5 μm [14C]thymidine (0.1 μCi/ml) (37DiBiase S.J. Zeng Z.C. Chen R. Hyslop T. Curran Jr., W.J. Iliakis G. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1245-1253PubMed Google Scholar, 38Kim C.H. Park S.J. Lee S.H. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 303: 753-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and treated with ionizing radiation. Following IR, cells were incubated at 37 °C with prewarmed (42 °C) fresh medium to allow dsb repair and then harvested at various times and resuspended in serum-free medium at a concentration of 2-5 × 106 cells/ml. Cells were mixed with an equal volume of 1% agarose, and the solidified cell-agarose suspensions were lysed with buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 m EDTA, 2% N-laurylsarcosyl, and proteinase E and O (0.1 mg/ml) for 16-18 h at 50 °C (37DiBiase S.J. Zeng Z.C. Chen R. Hyslop T. Curran Jr., W.J. Iliakis G. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1245-1253PubMed Google Scholar). DNA double-strand breaks were analyzed by asymmetric field inversion gel electrophoresis using 0.5% agarose gel in 0.5× TBE at 10 °C for 40 h. After electrophoresis, gels were analyzed by fluorography. For quantification of damaged DNA repair, intact chromosome and damaged DNA were separately removed from the gel and measured for 14C using liquid scintillation counter. Assessment of Chromatin-bound Proteins—Immunoblot analyses of chromatin-bound Ku complex and PCNA from WT and Ku80-/- cells were carried out following various doses of IR treatment. Cells were treated with cell lysis buffer I (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.3 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm DTT, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated for 90 min on ice. After centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 30 min, pellets were extensively washed four times with cell lysis buffer I, resuspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer, and analyzed by a 10% SDS-PAGE. Gels were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, probed with either Ku70/Ku80 antibody (goat polyclonal IgG, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or PCNA antibody (monoclonal mouse IgG, Oncogene Sciences) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Proteins were visualized by using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Laser-scanning Confocal Microscopy—Cells were grown up to 70% confluence on a sterilized Labtek II coverslip, irradiated with a 137Cs source, and further incubated at 37 °C until harvest. Immunofluorescence microscopy was carried out as described previously (8Balajee A.S. Geard C.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1341-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Treatment of Cells with Antisense Oligonucleotides—Cells were seeded in a 100-mm tissue culture plate (5 × 106) 24 h prior to an antisense oligonucleotide treatment. Indicated amounts of either control- or Ku80-antisense oligonucleotides (morpholino, Gene Tools, LLC.) were mixed with 200 μl of special delivery solution in a serum-free RPMI for 15 min at room temperature. After further incubation at room temperature for 20 min, antisense oligonucleotide solutions were added to cells in a 100-mm dish, briefly mixed, and returned to a 37 °C incubator for 3 h. Solutions were removed from dishes and replaced with fresh serum-containing media for further incubation at 37 °C 72 h before cell harvest. Ku80-deficient Cells Exhibit a Prolonged Retardation in DNA Replication Following IR—DNA-PK and ATM are the members of PI 3-kinase family involved in damage-induced cell cycle arrest. To investigate the role for these proteins in damage-induced S phase arrest, WT cells and the mutants (Atm-/-, Ku80-/-, and DNA-PKcs-/-) were labeled with [3H]thymidine (0.5 μCi/ml) 1 h prior to IR and examined for in vivo DNA synthesis (2 and 5 Gy). In the absence of IR, the rate of DNA synthesis in DNA-PKcs-/- or Ku80-/- cells was similar to WT cells (Fig. 1, A and B). IR treatment of either WT or DNA-PKcs-/- cells showed a slight decrease in their DNA replication activity for up to 8 h, while Ku80-/- cells exhibited a prolonged period (up to 24 h) of reduced rate of DNA synthesis following IR (Fig. 1, A and B). These results suggest that the Ku complex may have a unique role in DNA replication following DNA damage, which may not be shared with DNA-PKcs. IR-induced Lower Replication Activity in Ku80-/- Cells Is Independent of G1/S Transition or Intra-S Phase Checkpoint Pathway (RDS Pathway)—To investigate further IR-induced inhibition of replication associated with Ku80-/-, [3H]thymidine incorporation in Ku80-/- was compared with those in WT, DNA-PKcs-/-, and Atm-/- cells following IR treatment (2 or 5 Gy). WT, DNA-PKcs-/-, and Ku80-/- cells showed a lower [3H]thymidine incorporation following IR treatment (2 or 5 Gy), whereas IR treatment had no effect on that in Atm-/- cells (Fig. 2A, top panel). Interestingly, WT and DNA-PKcs-/- cells restored replication activity within 4-6 h following IR, whereas Ku80-/- cells did not (Fig. 2A, bottom panel), suggesting that IR-induced lower replication activity in Ku80-/- cells was not related to the ATM-mediated intra-S phase checkpoint pathway (10Falck J. Mailand N. Syljuasen R.G. Bartek J. Lukas J. Nature. 2001; 410: 842-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar, 11Falck J. Petrini J.H. Williams B.R. Lukas J. Bartek J. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 290-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) or an altered DNA-PK activity. We further examined whether IR-induced inhibition of replication activity in Ku80-/- cells is due to a blockade of G1/S phase transition or an alteration of the intra-S phase checkpoint pathway. WT and mutants (DNA-PKcs-/- and Ku80-/-) were initially pulse-labeled with BrdUrd to mark a defined population of cells in S phase and monitor their progression through G2/M phase of the cell cycle. Following 1-h pulse with BrdUrd, cells were treated with IR (5 Gy), cultured for the indicated times, and analyzed for cell cycle progression using fluorescence cytometry. In both WT and DNA-PKcs-/-, BrdUrd-labeled cells progressed through S phase but showed cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase following IR treatment (Fig. 2B and Table I). In contrast, treatment of Ku80-deficient cells with IR not only induced G2/M phase arrest but also exhibited a prolonged retardation in S phase of the cell cycle that continued for at least 16 h (Fig. 2B and Table I). A prolonged delay of Ku80-/- cells in S phase progression following IR was different from the ATM-mediated intra-S phase checkpoint pathway (Fig. 2B) that exhibits a transient replication arrest (10Falck J. Mailand N. Syljuasen R.G. Bartek J. Lukas J. Nature. 2001; 410: 842-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar, 11Falck J. Petrini J.H. Williams B.R. Lukas J. Bartek J. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 290-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Together, these results suggest the following: 1) IR-induced inhibition of S phase progression in Ku80-/- cells is not related to G1/S phase or the intra-S phase checkpoint pathway; 2) the Ku complex, unlike DNA-PKcs or ATM, may have a unique role in DNA replication following DNA damage.Table ICell cycle distribution of BrdUrd-incorporated mouse cells following IR treatmentWTKu80 −/−DNA-PKcs −/−HoursG1SG2/MG1SG2/MG1SG2/M048115580164791740792118512079218717790465451580121415701366230136516471537121734614412064161921381402236 Open table in a new tab IR-induced Retardation of S Phase Progression in Ku80-/- Cells Is Independent of DNA-PK Activity or dsb Repair—To investigate further whether IR-induced lower replication activity in Ku80-/- cells is due to the lack of the Ku complex and not associated with DNA-PK kinase activity, WT murine fibroblast cells were treated with a PI 3-kinase inhibitor, wortmannin, and examined for replication activity following IR treatment. Regardless of IR, wortmannin treatment had no effect on DNA synthesis in WT cells (data not shown), suggesting that the role for Ku complex in replication is unique and not related to DNA-PK kinase activity. Because the Ku complex also plays a crucial role in dsb repair, we examined repair kinetics of WT and mutants following a high dose of IR (Fig. 3). Both WT and Atm-/- cells showed efficient repair activity immediately following IR treatment, whereas Ku80-/- cells exhibited very little or no repair (Fig. 3). In the meanwhile, DNA-PKcs-/- cells showed effective but a much slower dsb repair compared with WT or Atm-/- cells (Fig. 3). This result suggests that IR-induced prolonged inhibition of replication activity in Ku80-/- cells may not be due to the lack of dsb repair because DNA-PKcs-/- cells, despite of its lower dsb repair activity, showed very little or no change in replication activity following IR. IR-induced Lower Replication Activity in Ku80-/- Cells Cannot Be Overcome by the Addition of Ku Complex in Vitro—IR-induced inhibition of replication activity in Ku80-/- may be overcome by addition of Ku70/Ku80 if the Ku complex is directly responsible for it. To test this, we carried out an in vitro chromatin replication reactions with intact nuclei and cytosolic extracts because most replication factors are present in cytosolic fractions of the cell extracts (39Li J.J. Kelly T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6973-6977Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Intact nuclei from WT or Ku80-/- cells efficiently supported DNA synthesis in vitro (Fig. 4), whereas a considerably lower DNA synthesis was observed in reactions containing nuclei from irradiated Ku80-/- cells regardless of the source of cytosolic extracts. This suggests that IR-induced lower replication activity was dependent on the nuclear fraction and not the cytosolic extracts (protein fractions). It should be pointed out that the addition of cytosolic extracts (from WT) to the nuclei (from irradiated Ku80-/) was not able to rescue lower replication activity (Fig. 4), although more than 80% of the Ku complex was in cytosolic extracts (data not shown). This suggests that IR treatment may modulate nuclei in the absence of functional Ku complex. IR Induces Dissociation of PCNA from Chromatin in Ku80-/- Cells but Not WT and DNA-PKcs-/- Cells—The observation that the addition of Ku complex was not able to overcome damage-induced replication inhibition in Ku80-/- cells (Fig. 4) raises the possibility that a lack of functionally active Ku complex may cause a change in chromatin structure or distribution of replication factor(s) following DNA damage, leading to a lower replication activity in vivo. In keeping with this notion, an increased interaction between the Ku70-Ku80 complex and PCNA was observed following DNA damage (8Balajee A.S. Geard C.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1341-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This prompted us to examine whether the presence of Ku complex affects the association of PCNA with chromatin following DNA damage. For this, nuclei were isolated from WT or Ku80-/- cells following IR and examined for the presence of PCNA. As reported previously (22Gottlieb T.M. Jackson S.P.

Interestingly, the amount of PCNA was markedly reduced following"

We have previously identified 11 genes whose expression was up- or down-regulated by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) in mouse skin keratinocyte progenitor cells (Wei, S.-J., Trempus, C.

Interestingly, stable transfection of the nm23-M2/NDPK-B del-RGD or G106A mutant gene in JB6 Cl 41-5a cells selectively abrogated NDPK-B-induced cellular transformation, implicating a possible Arg105-Gly106-Asp107 regulatory role in early skin carcinogenesis.

This novel approach was highly effective in the in vivo identification of TPA-inducible effector genes that might lead to neoplastic transformation. The protein kinase nm23-M2/NDPK-B was another one of nine TPA-up-regulated genes and was selected for further characterization. Nm23 is a large family of structurally and functionally conserved proteins consisting of 4-6 identical subunits of 17-20 kDa each, known also as nucleoside diphosphate kinases (NDPKs; EC 2.7.4.6) (9Parks J.R.E. Agarwal R.P. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 3rd Ed. 8. Academic Press, Inc., New York1973: 307-334Google Scholar). NDPKs were originally identified as essential housekeeping enzymes required for the synthesis of nucleoside triphosphates by catalyzing the transfer of the γ-phosphoryl groups from nucleoside triphosphates to nucleoside diphosphates via a phosphohistidine 118 enzyme intermediate, and they play a role in maintaining intracellular nucleotide concentrations (10Lascu I. Gonin P.J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2000; 32: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Altered expression of NDPK is also reportedly involved in many cellular processes, including oncogenesis (11Hailat N. Keim D.R. Melhem R.F. Zhu X. Eckerskorn C. Broudeur G.M. Reynolds C.P.

To date, eight distinct human NDPK genes, designated nm23-H1 to nm23-H8, have also been identified. Human nm23-H1 and nm23-H2 are 88% homologous and are closely linked on chromosome 17q21-22 near the Brca1 gene locus (31Backer J.M. Mendola C.E. Kovesdi I. Fairhurst J.L. O'Hara B. Eddy Jr., R.L.

DR-nm23 (nm23-H3), located on chromosome 16, is 70% identical to nm23-H1 and nm23-H2 and may play a role in normal hematopoiesis and in the induction of apoptosis (19Venturelli D. Martinez R. Melotti P. Casella I. Peschle C. Cucco C. Spampinato G. Darzynkiewicz Z. Calabretta B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7435-7439Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). nm23-H5 was specifically expressed in testis and found to encode a protein devoid of NDP kinase activity (36Munier A. Feral C. Milon L. Phung-Ba V. Gyapay G. Capeau J. Guellaen G. Lacombe M.L. FEBS Lett. 1998; 434: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Nm23-H6 is a mitochondrial NDPK and affects cytokinesis (37Tsuiki H. Nitta M. Furuya A. Hanai N. Fujiwara T. Inagaki M. Kochi M. Ushio Y. Saya H. Nakamura H. J. Cell.

Chem. 1991; 66: 8784-8789Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), is a basic protein recently identified as the human PuF factor, a transcriptional activator of the c-myc proto-oncogene (39Postel E.H. Berberich S.J. Flint S.J. Ferrone C.A. Science. 1993; 261: 478-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 40Berberich S.J. Postel E.H. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2343-2347PubMed Google Scholar). Mutational analysis has identified residues and domains of Nm23-H2 that are involved in DNA binding, implicating a role in the regulation of genes important to cell proliferation, differentiation, and cancer development (40Berberich S.J.

In colorectal carcinomas, nm23-H2 is among the most abundant overexpressed transcript, suggesting that nm23-H2 helps maintain the malignant phenotype in these tumors (35Zhang L. Zhou W. Velculescu V.E. Kern S.E. Hruban R.H. Hamilton S.R. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1997; 276: 1268-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar). Recently, nm23-M2/NDPK-B was also identified as a novel potential disease locus that was involved in mouse leukemic transformation (42Joosten M. Vankan-Berkhoudt Y. Tas M. Lunghi M. Jenniskens Y. Parganas E. Valk P.J.M. Löwenberg B. van den Akker E. Delwel R. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 7247-7255Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The biological functions of Nm23-M2/NDPK-B in cellular transformation still remain unknown. To gain insights into the contribution of this protein to early skin carcinogenesis, we characterized and studied the biological properties of Nm23-M2/NDPK-B. In this study, our data showed that Nm23-M2/NDPK-B was significantly induced either in vivo animal models or in vitro cell cultures by TPA or UVR and appeared to have a critical role in mediating neoplastic transformation of epidermal cells in the early stages of skin carcinogenesis. Using site-directed mutagenesis analysis, we further identified an RGD consensus sequence domain site in Nm23-M2/NDPK-B that was involved in the potentiation of cellular transformation activity. Nm23-M2/NDPK-B represents an attractive candidate mediator of TPA- or UVR-induced tumor promotion. Nm23-M2/NDPK-B rat monoclonal antibodies (mAb) were obtained from United States Biological (Swampscott, MA). V5 tag mouse mAb was from Invitrogen; α-tubulin mouse mAb was from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA); actin rabbit polyclonal antibody (pAb) was from Sigma. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Amersham Biosciences. Nm23-H2/NDPK-B mouse mAb (233.1) was a kind gift from Dr. Michel Véron (Institute Pasteur, Paris, France). Uridine 5′-[α-35S]thiotriphosphate triethylammonium salt (SP6/T7 grade) (∼800 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Restriction enzymes, including BamHI, XbaI, EcoRI, and HindIII, were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). The primers used in this study were purchased from Proligos Corp. (La Jolla, CA). Noble agar was purchased from Difco. The tumor promoter TPA was from Sigma. TPA-susceptible JB6 Cl 41-5a and TPA-resistant JB6 Cl 30-7b mouse epidermal cell clonal variants were from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and grown at 37 °C in a 95% air plus 5% CO2 atmosphere in Eagle's minimal essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) containing 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate (Invitrogen). Mouse fibroblast Rat-1, human keratinocyte HaCaT (generously provided by Dr. Norbert Fusenig, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany), and human epidermoid carcinoma cell A431 were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS. Tg·AC43 (a TPA-induced Tg·AC squamous cell carcinoma cell line) and FVB/N217 (an FVB/N carcinoma cell line) (43French J.E. Libbus B.L. Hansen L. Spalding J.W. Tice R.R. Mahler J. Tennant R.W. Mol. Carcinog. 1994; 11: 215-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) were cultured in RPMI1640/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (1:1) with 20% FBS. NIH/3T3 cells were maintained as described previously (44Paules R.S. Buccione R. Moschel R.C. Vande Woude G.F. Eppig J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5395-5399Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Cell lines used in this study were free of mycoplasma infection. 8-10-week-old female homozygous Tg·AC mice were obtained from the Taconic Laboratory of Animals and Services (Germantown, NY). Animal studies were carried out in compliance with the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. The dorsal skin surface of groups of four homozygous female Tg·AC mice were dosed twice weekly for 2 weeks with 5 μg of TPA in 200 μl of acetone. Untreated control mice were sacrificed on day 1 (designated as NS). Four dosing protocols were used as follows. Mice were dosed on day 1 and sacrificed on day 5 (designated as 1TPA); mice were dosed on days 1 and 5 and sacrificed on day 8 (designated as 2TPA); mice were dosed on days 1, 5, and 8 and sacrificed on day 12 (designated as 3TPA); and mice were dosed on days 1, 5, 8, and 12 and sacrificed respectively at 48 h (designated as 4TPA), 7 days (designated as 4TPA + 7 days), 14 days (designated as 4TPA + 14 days), and 21 days (designated as 4TPA + 21 days) after the last dose. TPA-induced papillomas and malignant tumors (spindle cell tumors and squamous cell carcinomas) were identified, removed, and characterized as described previously (6Spalding J.W. Momma J. Elwell M.R. Tennant R.W. Carcinogenesis. 1993; 14: 1335-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Tg·AC mice were irradiated with combination of 30-40% UVA and 60-70% UVB, as described previously (5Trempus C.S. Mahler J.F. Ananthaswamy H.N. Loughlin S.M. French J.E. Tennant R.W. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1998; 111: 445-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). After three exposures to UVA/UVB with 8.67 kJ/m2 per exposure, total cumulative dose of 26 kJ/m2, skin tissues (designated as UV1-UV4) were collected 24 h after the last exposure. Some animals were held for papilloma development (designated as UVP1-UVP6), and tumors were collected and stored at -80 °C. The full-length mouse nm23-M2/NDPK-B cDNA was generated by reverse transcription (RT) and PCR amplification using total RNA isolated from untreated (normal) skins harvested from Tg·AC mice. Because the nucleotide similarity (83%) and amino acid identity (88%) between nm23-M1/NDPK-A and nm23-M2/NDPK-B are relatively high (27Urano T. Takamiya K. Furukawa K. Shiku H. FEBS Lett. 1992; 309: 358-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), mouse nm23-M2/NDPK-B-specific primers were designed to exclude the possibility of cross-reactivity with mouse nm23-M1/NDPK-A. The specific primers used for PCR were as follows: forward (5′-CAC CAT GGC CAA CCT CGA GCG TA-3′) and reverse (5′-CTC GTA CAC CCA GTC ATG GGC ACA A-3′) for full-length mouse nm23-M2/NDPK-B cDNA cloning; forward (105→123) (5′-CAC CG105G TGG CCA TGA AGT TCC TT123-3′) and reverse (321→297) (5′-A321TC CCC ACG GAT GGT GCC TGG TTT T297-3′) for in situ hybridization assay. The amplified cDNA was cloned directly into pcDNA3.1D/V5-His-TOPOc mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen). For the in situ hybridization assay, a construct expressing 217 bp of mouse nm23-M2/NDPK-B sense or antisense RNA probe was generated as follows. pcDNA3.1D/nm23-M2/NDPK-B (105→321)-V5-His was digested with BamHI and XbaI and the mouse nm23-M2/NDPK-B cDNA fragment (105→321) was cloned into T3/T7-U19 plasmid (Ambion, Austin, TX). The deletion or point substitution mutations were introduced into mouse nm23-M2/NDPK-B cDNA by the ExSite™ PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis kit, as described in the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The mutagenic primers were 24-29 bases long and had a greater than 50% GC content. The oligonucleotides used to generate the different mouse Nm23-M2/NDPK-B mutants were as follows (base changes underlined): delRGD (RGD consensus sequence domain), 5′-TTC TGC ATT CAA GTT GGC AGG AAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-pGAT GGT GCC TGG TTT TGA ATC AGC-3′ (reverse); G106A (RGD consensus sequence domain), 5′-CAC CAT CCG TGC GGA TTT CTG CAT-3′ (forward) and 5′-pCCT GGT TTT GAA TCA GCT GGA TTG GTC TC-3′ (reverse); S122P (phosphoryl transfer activity site), 5′-AGT GAT CCG GTG GAG AGT GCT GAG AAA-3′ (forward) and 5′-pGCC ATG AAT GAT GTT CCT GCC AAC TTG-3′ (reverse); H118F (kinase activity site), 5′-CAT CAT TTT TGG CAG TGA TTC AGT GGA GAG TGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-pTTC CTG CCA ACT TGA ATG CAG AAA TCC CC-3′ (reverse). DNA sequences were verified using an automated Applied Biosystems sequencer and the BigDye™ Terminator Kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Plasmid DNAs were purified using purification kits from Qiagen (Stanford Valencia, CA) and were endotoxin-free when used for transfection into mammalian cells. Cells were transfected with empty vector pcDNA3.1, wild type nm23-M2/NDPK-B (WT) or mutant types nm23-M2/NDPK-B including delRGD, G106A, S122P, and H118F plasmid DNAs using LipofectAMINE PLUS™ reagents (Invitrogen). Transfected cells were cultured for at least 2 weeks in medium containing 400 μg/ml of geneticin (G418) (Invitrogen). Cells were analyzed by immunoblot to confirm the expression of mouse NDPK-B. Single-stranded cDNA was prepared from total RNA using the Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase SuperScript II (Invitrogen) with oligo(dT) primer and used as a template for PCR. PCR primers for mouse nm23-M2/NDPK-B were as described above. The forward and reverse primers of β2-microglobulin gene (217 bp in size), used as an internal control, are 5′-GAC TGG TCT TTC TAT ATC CTG G-3′ and 5′-CTT TCT GCG TGC ATA AAT TG-3′, respectively. PCR cycling was as follows: denaturation (94 °C, 45 s), annealing (58 °C, 45 s), and extension (72 °C, 2 min) for 30 cycles. The reaction was carried out in a PerkinElmer-9600 thermal cycler, and PCR products were analyzed using 2% agarose gels. DNA was quantified using Quantity One software version 4.0 (Bio-Rad). An in situ hybridization assay was performed as previously described (45Hansen L.A. Tennant R.W. Mol. Carcinog. 1994; 9: 143-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, skin tissues were removed from Tg·AC mice treated or untreated with multiple doses of TPA and fixed overnight in 10% neutral buffered formalin. Tissues were paraffin-embedded, and sections (6 μm) were cut onto SuperFrost Plus microscope slides (Daigger, Vernon Hills, IL). The sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated by successive washes in xylene and graded alcohols to 2× SSC, and then 2 × 106 cpm of [α-35S]UTP-labeled mouse nm23-M2/NDPK-B sense or antisense riboprobes was applied to slides. Riboprobes were prepared from T7/T3-U19/nm23-M2/NDPK-B (105→321) plasmid linearized with EcoRI (antisense) or HindIII (sense) using an in vitro T7 or T3 Riboprobe kit (Promega, Madison, WI). Following 40 °C overnight hybridization, tissues were washed in 2× SSC plus 50% formamide at 40 °C and then in 2× SSC, 1× SSC, 0.5× SSC, and 0.5× SSC for 30 min each wash at room temperature. To remove unbound probe, tissues were incubated with 20 μl of RNase (10 mg/ml). After several washes, the slides were dehydrated in graded alcohols and completely air-dried. The slides were then dipped into NTB-3 autoradiographic emulsion (Eastman Kodak Co.), exposed for 10 days at room temperature in the dark, dried in a light-tight container, and developed in Kodak D19 developer and fixer. The sections were counterstained with hematoxylin, covered with coverslips, and photographed under dark-field illumination (model BX51, Olympus Optical Co., Tokyo, Japan). Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in ice-cold modified radioimmunoprecipitation (RIPA) buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 mm NaF. Cell suspensions were gently rocked on an orbital shaker in a cold room for 15 min to lyse cells. Lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The skin tissues or tumors were homogenized and sonicated in ice-cold RIPA buffer and ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g for1hat4 °C. Protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and then transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were stained with primary antibodies, detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:3000) (Amersham Biosciences) and enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were stripped and rehybridized with anti-α-tubulin mouse mAb (1:1000) or anti-actin rabbit pAb (1:1000) as a control to confirm equal loading. Protein quantitation was determined by ImageQuant software version 5.1 (Amersham Biosciences), and relative quantity is shown below the panels of Figs. 3B, 4, 5, 6, and 8.Fig. 4In vitro dose response and kinetics of TPA-induced expression of nm23-M2/NDPK-B in epidermal cells. JB6 Cl 41-5a (A and B) or JB6 Cl 30-7b epidermal cells (C) were treated with the indicated TPA concentrations or exposed to 10 ng/ml TPA at indicated time points. Cells were harvested, and whole cell lysates were extracted using modified RIPA buffer. Sixty micrograms of whole-cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting for the detection of mouse Nm23-M2/NDPK-B (top panel). α-Tubulin (50 kDa) (lower panel) served as an internal control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 5Elevated NDPK-B expression in skin tumor cell lines and Tg·AC neoplasms.A, skin tumor cell lines.
