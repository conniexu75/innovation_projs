Herein, we demonstrate that NADPH oxidase (NOX) 3, a member of the NOX/dual domain oxidase family of NADPH oxidases, is highly expressed in specific portions of the inner ear. As assessed by real-time PCR, NOX3 mRNA expression in the inner ear is at least 50-fold higher than in any other tissues where its expression has been observed (e.g. fetal kidney, brain, skull). Microdissection and in situ hybridization studies demonstrated that NOX3 is localized to the vestibular and cochlear sensory epithelia and to the spiral ganglions. Transfection of human embryonic kidney 293 cells with NOX3 revealed that it generates low levels of ROS on its own but produces high levels of ROS upon co-expression with cytoplasmic NOX subunits. NOX3-dependent superoxide production required a stimulus in the absence of subunits and upon co-expression with phagocyte NADPH oxidase subunits p47phox and p67phox, but it was stimulus-independent upon co-expression with colon NADPH oxidase subunits NOX organizer 1 and NOX activator 1. Pre-incubation of NOX3-transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells with the ototoxic drug cisplatin markedly enhanced superoxide production, in both the presence and the absence of subunits. Our data suggest that NOX3 is a relevant source of ROS generation in the cochlear and vestibular systems and that NOX3-dependent ROS generation might contribute to hearing loss and balance problems in response to ototoxic drugs. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a major role in drug-, noise-, and age-dependent hearing loss, but the source of ROS in the inner ear remains largely unknown.

Our data suggest that NOX3 is a relevant source of ROS generation in the cochlear and vestibular systems and that NOX3-dependent ROS generation might contribute to hearing loss and balance problems in response to ototoxic drugs. The inner ear is a highly complex structure involved in hearing and balancing. The conversion of sound into electrical signals occurs within the cochlea, in the organ of Corti, and the electrical signals are conducted by the axons of spiral ganglion neurons to the brain. The linear movement of the head is sensed by the otolith organs (utricle and saccule) and the rotation movements by the ampulla of the semicircular canals. The signals generated in the vestibular system are transmitted by the vestibular ganglion neurons to the central nervous system. Hearing impairment caused by loss of cochlear function occurs frequently, if not invariably, over a lifetime. Noise and ototoxic chemicals may lead to a precocious, rapid hearing loss, whereas aging leads to a more insidious, chronic loss of hearing. Research over the last decades has identified reactive oxygen species (ROS) 1The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; NOX, NADPH oxidase; NOXA1, NOX activator 1; NOXO1, NOX organizer 1; gp91phox, 91-kDa glycoprotein subunit of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase; DUOX, dual domain oxidase; HEK, human embryonic kidney; RT, reverse transcription; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; PKC, protein kinase C. as the major factor mediating hearing loss (1Kopke R.

ROS is generated within the cochlea after exposure to ototoxic drugs (e.g. cisplatin (2Kopke R.D. Liu W. Gabaizadeh R. Jacono A. Feghali J. Spray D. Garcia P. Steinman H. Malgrange B. Ruben R.J.

Sci. 1999; 884: 368-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Signs of oxidative stress, such as DNA damage and lipid peroxidation, have been documented in vivo in response to those challenges (5Ohinata Y. Miller J.M. Altschuler R.A. Schacht J. Brain Res. 2000; 878: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 6Van Campen L.E. Murphy W.J. Franks J.R. Mathias P.I. Toraason M.A. Hear.

Neurol. 1999; 413: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The vestibular system is also damaged by ototoxic drugs (8Sergi B. Ferraresi A. Troiani D. Paludetti G. Fetoni A.R. Hear. Res. 2003; 182: 56-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 9Jones G.E. Balaban C.D. Jackson R.L. Wood K.A. Kopke R.D. Exp. Brain Res. 2003; 153: 293-306Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar) in a process that includes excessive ROS production (10Takumida M. Anniko M. Shimizu A. Watanabe H. Acta Otolaryngol. 2003; 123: 8-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 11Darlington C.L. Smith P.F. Curr. Opin. Investig. Drugs. 2003; 4: 841-846PubMed Google Scholar). Although the role of oxidative stress in inner ear damage is well established, its source is poorly understood. Non-enzymatic generation of ROS by the ototoxic gentamicin-Fe2+ complex has been suggested. However, an enzymatic source of superoxide was needed to convert inactive gentamicin-Fe3+ into redox-active gentamicin-Fe2+ complex (12Sha S.H. Schacht J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 26: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Thus, the presence of a superoxide-producing enzyme in the inner ear and its involvement in drug ototoxicity could be anticipated. Over the last decade, it has been proven that the expression of superoxide-generating NADPH oxidases (NOX) is not restricted to phagocytes. Besides the well known catalytic subunit of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase, gp91phox/NOX2 (for review, see Ref. 13Babior B.M. Lambeth J.D. Nauseef W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 397: 342-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar), six other superoxide-producing enzymes have been identified in mammals (14Bokoch G.M. Knaus U.G. Trends Biochem.

For most NOX and dual domain oxidase (DUOX) enzymes, a predominant tissue localization has been described (e.g. colon epithelium for NOX1 (16Suh Y.A. Arnold R.S. Lassegue B. Shi J. Xu X. Sorescu D.

The tissue distribution of NOX3 was systematically investigated in two studies (23Kikuchi H. Hikage M. Miyashita H. Fukumoto M. Gene. 2000; 254: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 24Cheng G. Cao Z. Xu X. Meir E.G. Lambeth J.D. Gene. 2001; 269: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar) in which the authors found only very low levels of NOX3 mRNA expression in embryonic kidney. Our knowledge of the activation mechanisms of the members of NOX/DUOX family varies considerably among individual enzymes. NOX1 and gp91phox/NOX2 are subunit-dependent enzymes that need to assemble with an activator subunit (NOXA1 and p67phox, respectively) and an organizer subunit (NOXO1 and p47phox, respectively) to generate superoxide (25Babior B.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 1464-1476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Banfi B. Clark R.A. Steger K. Krause K.H. J. Biol.

NOX5, DUOX1, and DUOX2, on the other hand, have N-terminal Ca2+-binding motifs (EF-hand domains) and, so far, one of them, NOX5, has been shown to be activated by increased Ca2+ concentration (29Banfi B. Tirone F. Durussel I. Knisz J. Moskwa P. Molnar G.Z. Krause K.H. Cox J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18583-18591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The mechanism of NOX4 activation is less clear; there are indications that it might be a constitutively active enzyme (18Geiszt M. Kopp J.B. Varnai P. Leto T.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8010-8014Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar, 19Shiose A. Kuroda J. Tsuruya K. Hirai M. Hirakata H. Naito S. Hattori M. Sakaki Y. Sumimoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1417-1423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Virtually nothing is known about NOX3 activation. Indeed, it has not been established whether NOX3 is a superoxide-producing enzyme at all. Herein, we demonstrate that NOX3 is highly expressed in the inner ear. We show that it generates low levels of ROS in a subunit-independent manner and high levels of ROS in the presence of activator and organizer subunits. We also demonstrate that an ototoxic drug, cisplatin, markedly increases NOX3-dependent superoxide production. Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's nutrient mixture F12 that was supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 4 mM l-glutamine. NOX3-, NOXO1, NOXA1, p47phox, and p67phox cDNAs were subcloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) and transfected into HEK293 cells with the Effectene transfection system (Qiagen). To obtain stable clones, NOX3-, NOXO1-, and NOXA1-transfected HEK293 cells were selected with 400 μg/ml G418 starting on the second day after transfection. After 14 days of selection, 24 surviving clones were tested for superoxide production. The positive clones were verified to express NOX3, NOXO1, and NOXA1 RNA by RT-RCR. Cloning of Mouse and Rat NOX3 cDNA—The first and last exons of mouse and rat NOX3 genes were identified based on their homology with the human NOX3 gene using the Ensembl Genome Browser (www.ensembl.org). Inner ear samples of mouse (strain C57Bl/6) and rat (strain Sprague-Dawley) were isolated, and total RNA was purified as described previously (30Yanai T. Katagiri T. Akiyama S. Imada M. Yamashita T. Chiba H. Takahashi N. Suda T. J. Bone Miner. Metab. 2001; 19: 345-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Primers were designed and used to amplify the full length of coding sequences (mouse NOX3: forward, 5′-atg ccg gtg tgc tgg att ctg aac-3′; reverse, 5′-cta gaa gtt ttc ctt gtt gta ata gaa-3′; rat NOX3: forward, 5′-gtg ttg gta gta aga gaa gtg tca tg-3′; reverse, 5′-c tag aag ttt tcc ttg ttg taa tag-3′) with TaqDNA polymerase (Qiagen) under standard conditions. PCR products were subcloned into pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen) and verified by sequencing. Tissue Distribution of NOX3—Total RNA was isolated from different organs of rat and mouse and from specific regions of the rat inner ear using the TRIzol reagent. Except for RNA purified from parts of the inner ear, samples were treated with DNase and then further purified with the use of an RNeasy kit (Qiagen). 2 μg total RNA from each tissue was reverse-transcribed using Superscript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen).

Standard PCR conditions were used, and the number of PCR cycles was 30 (Figs. 1 and 2) or 28 (Fig. 3) for the amplification of GAPDH and 35 for all other amplifications unless stated otherwise.Fig. 2PCR detection of cDNAs encoding NOX activator and regulator subunits in the inner ear.A, RT-PCR amplification of NOXA1, NOXO1, and the reference GAPDH cDNA from the indicated rat tissues.

All amplifications were carried out in MicroAmp optical 96-well reaction plates with optical adhesive covers (Applied Biosystems). The accumulation of PCR products was detected by monitoring the increase in fluorescence of the reporter dye. In Situ Hybridization—For in situ hybridization experiments, digoxigenin-labeled antisense and sense (negative control) cRNA probes (nucleotides 560–849 of mNOX3) were generated and used as described previously (20Banfi B. Molnar G. Maturana A. Steger K. Hegedus B. Demaurex N. Krause K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37594-37601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar) on decalcified, 7-μm thick inner ear sections. Measurement of Reactive Oxygen Species—ROS generation was measured by the peroxidase-dependent luminol-amplified chemiluminescence technique (referred to as luminol-amplified chemiluminescence) in 96-well microplates using Luminometer Wallac 1420 Multilabel Counter (PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences). Measurements were performed in Hanks' balanced salt solution supplemented with 1 mg/ml d-glucose, 1 unit/ml horseradish peroxidase, and 250 μm luminol. In some experiments, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) was added during the measurements to a final concentration of 100 nm. When the effect of cisplatin or 5-fluorouracil was investigated, these compounds were dissolved in Me2SO and pre-incubated with the cells for the indicated time and concentration in cell culture medium. Before ROS measurements, the cell culture medium was exchanged with the assay solution and chemiluminescence or absorption (see below) was measured at 37 °C. After measurements, cells were counted, and the results were normalized to 150,000 cells. Extracellular superoxide production was measured in 96-well microplates at 550 nm as the superoxide dismutase-sensitive reduction of 100 μm ferricytochrome c (referred to as cytochrome c reduction technique) in the presence or absence of ionomycin (1 μm) or hypoxanthine (40 μm) and xanthine oxidase (20 milliunits/ml). The superoxide production was calculated using an absorption coefficient of 21.1 mm-1 cm-1 and was normalized to 107 cells (31Mocsai A. Banfi B. Kapus A. Farkas G. Geiszt M. Buday L. Farago A. Ligeti E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 54: 781-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Cloning of Mouse and Rat NOX3 cDNA from Inner Ear— NOX3 mRNA has been shown to be expressed in human embryonic kidney, but expression levels were very low (23Kikuchi H. Hikage M. Miyashita H. Fukumoto M. Gene. 2000; 254: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 24Cheng G. Cao Z. Xu X. Meir E.G. Lambeth J.D. Gene. 2001; 269: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar); hence, the physiological relevance was questionable. We reasoned that the physiologically relevant localization of NOX3 might have been missed because previous studies had restricted their analysis to commercially available human RNA sources. To overcome these limitations, we decided to work in mouse and rat and to prepare RNA from tissues that had not yet been investigated. Because hitherto only the human NOX3 sequence was known, we identified mouse and rat NOX3 genes by searching genomic DNA databases and designed, based on these results, mouse and rat NOX3 PCR primers. We then prepared RNA from a variety of mouse and rat tissues, including bone (femur, skull, shoulder blade), cartilage (joints of ribs, outer ear), and inner ear and analyzed them for NOX3 expression by RT-PCR. As shown on Fig. 1A, high levels of NOX3 transcript were detected only in the rat inner ear sample (despite its relatively low mRNA content demonstrated by the low amount of GAPDH PCR product). Using primer pairs designed from the first and the last exons of the mouse and rat NOX3 gene, respectively, we amplified the complete coding regions of mouse and rat NOX3 cDNA sequences from inner ear samples. The predicted amino acid sequences of both mouse and rat NOX3 showed 81% sequence identity with the human sequence and 93.5% identity with each other (GenBank accession numbers of rat and mouse NOX3: AY573239 and AY573240, respectively). NOX3 Is Predominantly Expressed in the Inner Ear—Based on the cDNA sequence of mouse NOX3, we designed primers for real-time PCR to study quantitative expression of NOX3 mRNA in different mouse tissues. 18 S RNA was used as a reference gene. The results of real-time PCR demonstrated that NOX3 was predominantly expressed in the inner ear (Fig. 1B). Low amounts of NOX3 mRNA could also be detected in skull, brain, and embryonic kidney. However, inner ear contained 50- and 870-fold greater NOX3 content compared with skull and embryonic kidney, respectively (Fig. 1B). Expression of Cytoplasmic NOX Subunits in the Inner Ear— NOX1 and gp91phox/NOX2 require cytoplasmic organizer subunits (NOXO1, p47phox) and activator subunits (NOXA1, p67phox) to form a functional enzyme. Because NOX3 shows a high degree of homology with NOX1 and gp91phox/NOX2 (32Lalucque H. Silar P. Trends Microbiol. 2003; 11: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), we considered that it might also be a subunit-dependent enzyme. We therefore investigated expression of cytoplasmic NOX subunits in the inner ear. RT-PCR analysis (using 35 PCR cycles) showed that mRNA of the activator subunit NOXA1, as well as mRNA of the organizer subunit p47phox, were expressed in the inner ear (Fig. 2, A and B). mRNA of the activator subunit p67phox and the organizer subunit NOXO1 could be detected only at very high cycle numbers (40 PCR cycles; data not shown). Because p47phox mRNA is expressed in phagocytic cells, its detection is probably a result of the leukocyte content of the tissue sample. Confirming that hypothesis, gp91phox/NOX2 mRNA, typically expressed in phagocytes, could also be detected from inner ear by RT-PCR (supplemental Fig. 1S). In contrast, NOXA1 is not expressed in blood cells (26Banfi B. Clark R.A. Steger K. Krause K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3510-3513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar) or in tissues neighboring the inner ear (Fig. 2A); thus, it is most probably expressed within cells of the inner ear. Expression of NOX3 in Different Parts of the Cochlea—To identify regions of the inner ear that express NOX3, we isolated distinct parts of rat cochlea, such as organ of Corti, stria vascularis, and spiral ganglia, from newborn rats (postnatal day 0 to 4) as described previously (33Malgrange B. Rogister B. Lefebvre P.P. Mazy-Servais C. Welcher A.A. Bonnet C. Hsu R.Y. Rigo J.M. Van De Water T.R. Moonen G. Neurochem. Res. 1998; 23: 1133-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). As a control tissue, we used dorsal root ganglia. Total RNA was extracted from these tissues and tested for NOX3 and GAPDH housekeeping gene expression by RT-PCR. Results showed that NOX3 was expressed in spiral ganglia and in the organ of Corti, whereas stria vascularis and dorsal root ganglia were devoid of NOX3 mRNA (Fig. 3). Our experiments demonstrated that 1) NOX3 is expressed only in selected structures of the cochlea (i.e. organ of Corti and spiral ganglia) and 2) its expression is not a general property of the peripheral nervous system (i.e. it was absent from dorsal root ganglia). Localization of NOX3 mRNA by in Situ Hybridization—To further define the sites of NOX3 expression, we performed in situ hybridizations of adult mouse inner ear sections. The antisense NOX3 probe labeled spiral ganglion neurons (Fig. 4A) but not the stria vascularis (Fig. 4C). The sense probe gave only a weak, uniform background signal demonstrating the specificity of the antisense hybridization (Fig. 4, B and D). The cellular structures within the organ of Corti were not sufficiently well preserved to verify NOX3 expression by in situ hybridization. Specific labeling for NOX3 was also observed in the vestibular system, in the sensory epithelial cell layer of the saccule (Fig. 4, E and F). NOX3-dependent Superoxide Generation in the Absence of Subunits—To investigate its molecular function, we transiently expressed NOX3 in HEK293 cells, which do not express this enzyme endogenously. Superoxide production was measured with cytochrome c reduction technique and with luminol-amplified chemiluminescence. Using either technique, NOX3-transfected cells generated low amounts of superoxide, but only in the presence of a PKC activator (PMA) (Fig. 5). Because both NOX1 and gp91phox/NOX2 have an obligatory subunit requirement, the stimulus-dependent and subunit-independent activity of NOX3 is a unique and distinguishing feature of this NOX isoform. Regulation of NOX3 by the Organizer and Activator Subunits of NOX1 and gp91phox/NOX2—Because expression of NOX regulator and activator subunits was detected in the inner ear (see above, Fig. 2), we reasoned that they might influence NOX3 activity. Thus, we investigated superoxide generation by NOX3 upon co-transfection with cytoplasmic subunits. In the first series of experiments, NOX3 was co-transfected with the cytosolic subunits of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase, p67phox and p47phox. In these transfectants, the NOX3-dependent superoxide generation was markedly increased, even without an added stimulus (Fig. 6A). The addition of PMA, however, led to a strong enhancement of NOX3 activity (Fig. 6A). HEK293 cells, transfected with p47phox and p67phox but devoid of NOX3, produced no superoxide (data not shown). It is interesting that p67phox in the absence of p47phox was sufficient to double the PMA-induced superoxide generation of NOX3, whereas p47phox in the absence of p67phox did not modify NOX3 activity (compare Fig. 5 and Fig. 6A). We next investigated whether NOX3 could be regulated by the NOXO1 and NOXA1 subunits, which are associated with NOX1 in the colon. Co-transfection of NOX3 with NOXO1 and NOXA1 resulted in a massive increase of superoxide production (Fig. 6B). The NOXO1/NOXA1-enhanced superoxide generation was insensitive to PMA (Fig. 6B). The co-expression of NOXA1 with NOX3, in the absence of NOXO1, had an enhancing effect on PMA-stimulated NOX3 activity. NOXO1 alone, however, did not influence NOX3-dependent superoxide production (Fig. 6B, bottom). We and others had previously shown that, at least on a biochemical level, there is promiscuity among the organizer and regulator subunits: NOXO1 is able to function with p67phox and NOXA1 is able to function with p47phox (26Banfi B.

Chem. 2003; 278: 25234-25246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated which combinations of organizer and activator subunits are capable of regulating NOX3 and what kind of properties those complexes might have. Expression of NOXO1, p67phox, and NOX3 in HEK293 cells led to spontaneous superoxide generation that could not be further enhanced by PMA (Fig. 6C). However, when p47phox, NOXA1, and NOX3 were expressed, superoxide production by HEK293 cells was largely PMA-dependent (Fig. 6C). Thus, the organizer subunit (p47phox versus NOXO1) determines whether NOX3 activity is PKC-dependent or -independent. Increased Superoxide Production after Cisplatin Treatment—Cisplatin is an ototoxic drug that exerts its toxic effect, at least in part, through induction of ROS generation in the inner ear (2Kopke R.D. Liu W. Gabaizadeh R. Jacono A. Feghali J. Spray D. Garcia P. Steinman H. Malgrange B. Ruben R.J. Rybak L. Van de Water T.R. Am. J. Otol. 1997; 18: 559-571PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the effect of cisplatin on NOX3-dependent superoxide production, we generated HEK293 clones stably expressing NOX3, NOXO1, and NOXA1 subunits. These clones produced superoxide constitutively and spontaneously as observed in the transient transfectants (Fig. 7A); upon incubation with cisplatin (20 μm, 12 h), a marked increase of superoxide production was detected by the luminol-amplified chemiluminescence (Fig. 7, A and B), and also by cytochrome c reduction (Fig. 7E). Vector-transfected cells did not generate superoxide in either the presence or the absence of cisplatin (Fig. 7A). Superoxide generation of cisplatin-treated NOX3/NOXO1/NOXA1-transfected cells was insensitive to PMA (Fig. 7B) and could be abolished by an NADPH oxidase inhibitor, diphenylene iodonium (Fig. 7A). Likewise, after 12-hour incubation with cisplatin (20 μm), increased superoxide production was measured using HEK293 cells co-transfected with NOX3, p47phox, and p67phox (Fig. 7B) or using HEK293 cells transfected with NOX3 alone (data not shown). As control, we investigated the effect of another chemotherapeutic drug, 5-fluorouracil, which is devoid of ototoxicity. Incubation of NOX3/NOXO1/NOXA1-expressing cells with 5-fluorouracil (100 μm, 17 h) did not influence superoxide production (data not shown). We next investigated the range of cisplatin concentrations that affect superoxide production of NOX3/NOXO1/NOXA1-transfected cells. After incubating the cells with various concentrations of cisplatin for 12 h, superoxide production was measured (Fig. 7C). Cisplatin caused an increase of NOX3-dependent ROS generation at 1 μm concentration, and 20 μm cisplatin had a nearly maximal effect (Fig. 7C; EC50 = 3.6 ± 1.4 μm). To examine the time course of the effect of cisplatin on superoxide production, NOX3/NOXO1/NOXA1-transfected cells were incubated with 20 μm cisplatin for various periods of time. Superoxide generation was enhanced already after 5 h of cisplatin treatment and reached its maximal effect after around 17 h (Fig. 7D; t50 = 11.5 ± 1.7 h). Until this point our results were compatible with two possible modes of action of cisplatin: 1) it might increase NOX3 enzyme activity or 2) cisplatin or its derivatives might produce superoxide themselves in the presence of another superoxide generating system, as has been described for the gentamicin-Fe2+ complex (12Sha S.H. Schacht J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 26: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and for lucigenin (34Liochev S.I. Fridovich I. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 25: 926-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In the latter case, cisplatin would increase superoxide production regardless of its source. Therefore, we compared the superoxide production of three different superoxide-producing enzymes (NOX3, NOX5, and xanthine oxidase) with or without cisplatin pre-incubation using cytochrome c reduction assay. NOX3/NOXO1/NOXA1-transfected, NOX5-transfected, and control transfected HEK293 cells were treated with 20 μm cisplatin for 24 h. Superoxide production was measured in the absence of stimulus (NOX3/NOXO1/NOXA1 transfectants), in the presence of 1 μm ionomycin (NOX5 transfectants), or in the presence of 40 μm hypoxanthine and 20 milliunits/ml xanthine oxidase (control transfected cells). Cisplatin enhanced NOX3-, NOX5-, and xanthine oxidase-dependent superoxide productions, indicating that its effect was not restricted to NOX3 (Fig. 7E). Thus, cisplatin may amplify superoxide production downstream of the oxidase. In this study, we demonstrated high-level expression of the NADPH oxidase NOX3 in the inner ear. We also demonstrated that NOX3 is capable of generating superoxide, with a pattern of subunit and stimulus dependence that is distinct from other known NOX family NADPH oxidases. Finally, we showed that an ototoxic drug, cisplatin, could enhance NOX3-dependent superoxide production. Vestibular and cochlear sensory epithelia develop from a common ectodermal thickening at the head region, called placode (35Fekete D.M. Wu D.K. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2002; 12: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The otic placode also gives rise to the neurons that will form the inner ear ganglia (36Fritzsch B.F. Barald K.F. Lomax M.I. Rubel E.W. Popper A.N. Fay R.R. Development of the Auditory System. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1998: 80-145Google Scholar). Our data suggest that the expression of NOX3 mRNA may follow this pattern. We demonstrated in this study that NOX3 is a superoxide-generating enzyme. NOX3, as opposed to NOX1 and NOX2, produces low levels of superoxide upon PKC activation without the need for subunits. Although the activation of phagocyte NADPH oxidase is thought to occur through PKC-dependent phosphorylation of p47phox (13Babior B.M. Lambeth J.D. Nauseef W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 397: 342-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar), this obviously cannot be the mechanism of the subunit-independent activation of NOX3. At this point, PKC might activate NOX3 by numerous possible pathways (e.g. direct phosphorylation of NOX3, activation of the small GTPase protein Rac1, or changes in the lipid environment). However, because the subunit-independent ROS generation by NOX3 is of low level in the transfected cells, its ability to exert biological effect in vivo remains to be clarified. NOX3 activity is massively enhanced by NOX organizer and regulator subunits. Searches of genomic databases suggest that there are no close homologues of p47phox and p67phox other than NOXO1 and NOXA1, respectively. Thus, if NOX3 functions in a subunit-dependent manner in vivo, it would have to use the subunits of other NOX enzymes. Based on our PCR data (Fig. 2), NOX3 could potentially interact with NOXA1, whereas the detection of p47phox is probably the result of the leukocyte content of the inner ear. It is possible, however, that in a very limited number of cells, other cytosolic NOX subunits are also expressed in the inner ear. It is interesting that although there are a considerable number of studies on the pathological effect of excessive ROS production in the inner ear (for reviews see Refs. 1Kopke R. Allen K.A. Henderson D. Hoffer M. Frenz D. Van de Water T. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 884: 171-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar and 4Henderson D. McFadden S.L. Liu C.C. Hight N. Zheng X.Y. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 884: 368-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), there is only one very recent study, which suggests a physiological role of ROS in the inner ear. During the preparation of this article, Paffenholz et al. (37Paffenholz R. Bergstrom R.A. Pasutto F. Wabnitz P. Munroe R.J. Jagla W. Heinzmann U. Marquardt A. Bareiss A. Laufs J. Russ A. Stumm G. Schimenti J.C. Bergstrom D.E. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 486-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) reported that het (head tilt) mice, which are characterized by impaired balance and by the lack of otoconia formation in the utricle and saccule, carry mutations in the NOX3 gene. The het mice do not have gross hearing deficits, suggesting no overt physiological role of NOX3 in hearing. However, a pathological role for NOX3 is possible not only in the vestibular system but also in the cochlea. Ototoxic drugs (such as platinum derivatives or aminoglycoside antibiotics) lead to accumulation of ROS both in the cochlea (3Clerici W.J. Hensley K. DiMartino D.L. Butterfield D.A. Hear. Res. 1996; 98: 116-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) and in the vestibular system (8Sergi B. Ferraresi A. Troiani D. Paludetti G. Fetoni A.R. Hear.

Otorhinolaryngol. Relat. Spec. 2002; 64: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and noise trauma has been demonstrated to be a prominent cause of ROS production in the cochlea (39Ohlemiller K.K. Wright J.S. Dugan L.L. Audiol. Neurootol. 1999; 4: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). A permanent increase of ROS concentration, in turn, leads primarily to the death of sensory epithelial cells, and, to a lesser extent, to the death of innervating neurons (1Kopke R. Allen K.A. Henderson D. Hoffer M. Frenz D. Van de Water T. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 884: 171-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Cisplatin is able to increase the amount of superoxide generated by three different enzyme systems including NOX3, NOX5, and xanthine oxidase (Fig. 7E). However, because of its tissue localization, NOX3 is the most likely to be involved in ROS-mediated cisplatin ototoxicity. The time course and dose response of the cisplatin effect on superoxide generation of NOX3 transfectants is compatible with the time course (2Kopke R.D. Liu W. Gabaizadeh R. Jacono A. Feghali J. Spray D. Garcia P. Steinman H. Malgrange B. Ruben R.J. Rybak L. Van de Water T.R. Am. J. Otol. 1997; 18: 559-571PubMed Google Scholar) and dose-response (40Zhang M. Liu W. Ding D. Salvi R. Neuroscience. 2003; 120: 191-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) of cisplatin toxicity to inner ear sensory cells. Taken together, our results suggest that NOX3 is a superoxide-generating enzyme in the inner ear. NOX3 seems to be required for otoconia formation under physiological circumstances, but it is also likely to be involved in ROS-mediated cisplatin ototoxicity. We thank A. Hild and L.

https://openalex.org/W2166217974,"Joubert syndrome is a congenital brain malformation of the cerebellar vermis and brainstem with abnormalities of axonal decussation (crossing in the brain) affecting the corticospinal tract and superior cerebellar peduncles1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. Individuals with Joubert syndrome have motor and behavioral abnormalities, including an inability to walk due to severe clumsiness and 'mirror' movements, and cognitive and behavioral disturbances5,6,7,8,10,11,12. Here we identified a locus associated with Joubert syndrome, JBTS3, on chromosome 6q23.2–q23.3 and found three deleterious mutations in AHI1, the first gene to be associated with Joubert syndrome. AHI1 is most highly expressed in brain, particularly in neurons that give rise to the crossing axons of the corticospinal tract and superior cerebellar peduncles. Comparative genetic analysis of AHI1 indicates that it has undergone positive evolutionary selection along the human lineage. Therefore, changes in AHI1 may have been important in the evolution of human-specific motor behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W2009045981,"Defects in cilia are associated with several human disorders, including Kartagener syndrome1, polycystic kidney disease2,3, nephronophthisis4 and hydrocephalus5. We proposed that the pleiotropic phenotype of Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), which encompasses retinal degeneration, truncal obesity, renal and limb malformations and developmental delay, is due to dysfunction of basal bodies and cilia6,7. Here we show that individuals with BBS have partial or complete anosmia. To test whether this phenotype is caused by ciliary defects of olfactory sensory neurons, we examined mice with deletions of Bbs1 or Bbs4. Loss of function of either BBS protein affected the olfactory, but not the respiratory, epithelium, causing severe reduction of the ciliated border, disorganization of the dendritic microtubule network and trapping of olfactory ciliary proteins in dendrites and cell bodies. Our data indicate that BBS proteins have a role in the microtubule organization of mammalian ciliated cells and that anosmia might be a useful determinant of other pleiotropic disorders with a suspected ciliary involvement."

Primarily based on morphological features, animal cell death is usually referred to as apoptosis or necrosis. Apoptosis is characterized by membrane blebbing, cytosolic condensation, cell shrinkage, nuclear condensation, breakdown of nuclear DNA, and finally, the formation of apoptotic bodies that can easily be taken up by other cells (1Fiers W. Beyaert R. Declercq W. Vandenabeele P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7719-7730Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). Necrosis, as defined on a microscopic level, denotes cell death in which cells swell, round up, and then suddenly collapse, spilling their contents into the medium. However, in animals, other forms of cell death exist, such as autophagic and autolytic death and intermediate varieties (2Lockshin R.A. Zakeri Z. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 727-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In plants “programmed cell death” usually denotes apoptosis-like cell death characterized by chromatin aggregation, cell shrinkage, cytoplasmic, and nuclear condensation, and DNA fragmentation (3Buckner B.

Apoptotic characteristics have been observed during hypersensitive response and after abiotic stress, such as exposure to ozone, UV irradiation, chilling, and salt stress (6Danon A. Gallois P.

On a biochemical level, apoptosis in animals is characterized and commonly defined by the activation of a family of cysteine-dependent aspartate-specific proteases, or caspases (11Earnshaw W.C. Martins L.M. Kaufmann S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 383-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (2417) Google Scholar). Caspases can proteolytically activate downstream caspases or cut various cellular substrates, resulting in a plethora of structural and metabolic alterations, ultimately leading to cell death (11Earnshaw W.C. Martins L.M. Kaufmann S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 383-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (2417) Google Scholar, 12Cohen G.M. Biochem.

Caspases hydrolyze peptide bonds at the C-terminal side of an aspartate, the so-called P1 residue. By using a variety of synthetic oligopeptide caspase substrates and inhibitors with an aspartate at this P1 position, caspase-like activity has recently been demonstrated in various plant cell death models (14Bozhkov P.V.

Cultures were harvested, resuspended in extraction buffer (50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm oxidized glutathione), and passed through a French press. Cellular debris were removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was mixed with TALON cobalt affinity resin (BD Biosciences) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Beads were washed twice in the same buffer, loaded on a column, and washed twice again. Bound protein was eluted with extraction buffer supplemented with 150 mm imidazole. Metacaspase and Caspase Assays, Substrates, and Inhibitors—All tested fluorogenic substrates were obtained from Bachem (Bubendorf, Switzerland), except for d-VKKR-AMC (Enzyme Systems Products, Livermore, CA) and inhibitors from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO), except for the caspase inhibitors, Z-FA-fmk and Z-FK-tbmk (Enzyme Systems Products). Assays were performed in 150 μl with 50 μm substrate in optimized metacaspase assay buffers. For Atmc9, the buffer consisted of 50 mm MES (pH 5.5), 150 mm NaCl, 10% (w/v) sucrose, 0.1% (w/v) CHAPS, 10 mm dithiothreitol; for Atmc4 the buffer consisted of 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 100 mm CaCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol; for caspase activity assays, the buffer consisted of 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, and 10 mm 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane. For the determination of the pH profile of metacaspases, the buffer consisted of 50 mm acetic acid, 50 mm MES, and 100 mm Tris (25Ellis K.J. Morrison J.F.

The alignment of the corresponding protein sequences is shown in Fig. 1 and the corresponding phylogenetic tree in Fig. 2. Previous genomic analysis has revealed that the Arabidopsis genome consists of a large number of duplicated blocks, which might be the results of one or many complete genome duplications (28Initiative Arabidopsis Genome Nature. 2000; 408: 796-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (7006) Google Scholar, 29Raes J.

Comparison of the genomic organization of all nine Arabidopsis metacaspases and these duplicated segments shows that the Atmc8 gene is linked with genes Atmc4, Atmc5, Atmc6, and Atmc7 by an internal duplication event on chromosome I (data not shown). In addition, these genes (Atmc4 to Atmc7) are present as a tandem within a region of 10.6 kilobases on chromosome I. By combining the phylogenetic tree topology (Fig. 2) and this genomic organization, this metacaspase cluster (genes Atmc4 to Atmc7) originated through a block duplication of the Atmc8 gene that was followed by a tandem duplication. As shown in Fig. 1, a high degree of similarity exists between the members of this cluster, with amino acid sequence identities ranging from 56% to 71%. We isolated the corresponding open reading frames of all but one genes by reverse transcription-PCR on pooled RNA isolated from different organs of Arabidopsis. Despite several attempts we could not isolate a full-length Atmc8 cDNA fragment. Because no expressed sequence tags corresponding to Atmc8 are found in public databases, we assume that it is probably a pseudogene.Fig. 2Unrooted phylogenetic tree of the Arabidopsis metacaspase family. For construction of the tree, the alignment of Fig. 1 was subjected to the TREECON software package (52Van de Peer Y. De Wachter R. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1994; 10: 569-570PubMed Google Scholar). On the right side a tentative schematic representation of the structure of the nine Arabidopsis metacaspases is presented. The putative prodomain is in dark gray, the large subunit (p20) is in white, the small subunit (p10) is in black, and the linker/loop regions between p20 and p10 are in light gray. H and C designate His and Cys residues, respectively. Cysteine residues within the putative prodomain zinc fingers are shown as white stripes.

They possess N-terminal extensions ranging from ∼80 to 120 amino acids in length (Fig. 2; Ref. 20Uren A.G. O'Rourke K. Aravind L.A. Pisabarro M.T. Seshagiri S. Koonin E.V. Dixit V.M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 961-967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and could represent a prodomain that is also present in mammalian upstream “initiator” caspases. As such, this domain may be responsible for protein-protein interactions between metacaspases and/or other oligomerizing components of different signaling complexes, leading to subsequent metacaspase activation (11Earnshaw W.C. Martins L.M. Kaufmann S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 383-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (2417) Google Scholar, 31Boatright K.M. Renatus M. Scott F.L. Sperandio S. Shin H. Pedersen I.M. Ricci J.-E.

The Arabidopsis metacaspase prodomains are rich in proline (Atmc1 and Atmc2) or glutamine (Atmc3), and all contain two putative CXXC-type zinc finger structures, similar to the lesion-simulating disease-1 protein, a negative regulator of the hypersensitive response with homology to GATA-type transcription factors (20Uren A.G.

Dean C. Dangl J.L. Cell. 1997; 88: 685-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). The other metacaspases (Atmc4 to Atmc9) lack a large prodomain, although the existence of a short prodomain cannot be excluded, and were designated type II metacaspases (20Uren A.G. O'Rourke K. Aravind L.A. Pisabarro M.T. Seshagiri S. Koonin E.V. Dixit V.M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 961-967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In both types, a conserved region of ∼150 amino acids could correspond with the p20 subunit of mammalian caspases (11Earnshaw W.C. Martins L.M. Kaufmann S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 383-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (2417) Google Scholar). At the C terminus, another conserved domain is reminiscent of the p10 of caspases. In between these putative p20 and p10 domains, a variable region is present that differs considerably between type I and type II metacaspases; this putative loop or linker region is ∼20 amino acids long in type I metacaspases, whereas in type II metacaspases it varies in size from 90 (for Atmc9) to 150 residues (Atmc4 to Atmc8). In addition to this structural domain homology, the designation of metacaspases as caspase homologs is based on the presence of a conserved histidine/cysteine dyad in the p20 domain. The sequence context of the catalytic histidine residue in Arabidopsis metacaspases is H(Y/F)SGHG, suggesting an intermediate stabilizing role for the adjacent glycine, as in mammalian caspases (11Earnshaw W.C. Martins L.M. Kaufmann S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 383-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (2417) Google Scholar). The catalytic cysteine in caspases is contained in a QAC(R/Q)G context, with the glutamine residue shown to coordinate the P1 aspartate. The metacaspases of Arabidopsis have a D(A/S)C(H/N)SG signature, suggesting that this role is now played by an aspartate. Bacterial Overproduction of Arabidopsis Type II Metacaspases Leads to Cysteine-dependent Autocatalytic Processing—Upon overproduction in bacteria, caspases autoprocess in a cysteine-dependent manner to generate fully active proteases (11Earnshaw W.C. Martins L.M. Kaufmann S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 383-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (2417) Google Scholar). We initiated a biochemical analysis by overproducing N-terminal His6-tagged versions of the Arabidopsis type II metacaspases in E. coli (Fig. 3a). Detection with anti-His6 antibody revealed that all type II metacaspases could be produced in bacteria and, more interestingly, that this overproduction led to their processing, in analogy to caspases. Only for Atmc6 was cleavage less clear. During this processing, a C-terminal region ranging from 15 to 30 kDa was removed, resulting in a concomitant decrease in the size of the detected His6-tagged protein. For a detailed analysis of the type II metacaspases, we chose Atmc4 as a representative of the closely related group encoded by the gene cluster Atmc4 to Atmc7, together with Atmc9. For these two proteins, mutant forms in which the presumed catalytic cysteine (Cys139 for Atmc4 and Cys147 for Atmc9) was replaced by an alanine (designated C/A mutation) were also produced. Fig. 3b shows immunoblots with anti-His6 antibodies on bacterial lysates overproducing wild-type and mutated Atmc4 and Atmc9. Overproduction of Atmc4 resulted in the presence of the His6-tagged full-length protein (apparent molecular mass 60 kDa) and of an N-terminal fragment of 33 kDa. For Atmc9, overproduction led to the detection of the His6-tagged full-length protein (apparent molecular mass 46 kDa) and an N-terminal fragment of 28 kDa. These patterns suggest that both metacaspases, like caspases, are able to autoprocess, thereby separating the putative large (p20) and small (p10) subunits. For the cysteine mutants, no such processing occurred, demonstrating that it is the result of cysteine-dependent autocatalytic action of the type II metacaspases. Atmc9 Autoprocesses after an Arginine Residue—Because bacterial overproduction of type II metacaspases is sufficient for autoprocessing, we were able to characterize the putative p20 and p10 subunits of Atmc9 by N-terminal peptide sequencing and by molecular mass determination via mass spectrometry. When His6 tag-purified Atmc9 was analyzed by PAGE and silver staining, major fragments with apparent molecular masses of 22 and 15 kDa were visible, whereas bands at 38 and 28 kDa were less clear (Fig. 4). Western blot analysis revealed that besides the full-length C/A mutant, only the 28-kDa fragment of wild-type Atmc9 could be detected with the anti-His6 antibody and, thus, represented the His6-tagged p20-like subunit. Therefore, the 22-kDa band could represent the mature p20 subunit after removal of the His6 tag and possibly a very short prodomain, whereas the other fragment (15 kDa) could be the p10-like subunit. It should be noted that, although the p20- and p10-like fragments did not carry a His6 tag, they probably co-purified in complexes that did so. Furthermore, we observed that processing and concomitant disappearance of the full-length zymogen, which occurred after purification, also resulted in the presence of these non-tagged fragments. The 15-kDa protein band was sufficiently purified and Edman degradation sequencing resulted in the peptide sequence ALPFKAV, indicating that the fragment was generated by cleavage after Arg183. Molecular mass determination by matrix-assisted laser absorption deionization coupled to tandem time of flight revealed the p10-like subunit of Atmc9 had a mass of 15,442 Da, confirming that it consists of amino acids 184–325. As seen on Fig. 1, all type II metacaspases possess either an arginine or a lysine at this position. The nature of the autocatalytic cleavage site of Atmc9 already suggests that, although mammalian caspases and metacaspases are structural homologs, they differ in substrate specificity, with a Lys/Arg specificity at the P1 position for the latter. N-terminal sequencing of the 22-kDa fragment revealed that it was generated through removal of the His6 tag at an artificial site, LYKK↓AGST, introduced by the Gateway cloning procedure (data not shown). A few residues downstream a similar sequence were present, conserved in both type I and type II metacaspases. Therefore, it is possible that the natural processing site is masked by the artificial one, and hence, no conclusions can be drawn for now on any additional processing on the N-terminal side of the large subunit. Atmc4 and Atmc9 Cleave P1 Arginine/Lysine Substrates—To study the substrate specificity of Atmc4 and Atmc9 in more detail, the purified recombinant proteins and their respective cysteine mutants were tested for their ability to cleave the synthetic fluorogenic oligopeptide P1 arginine substrate t-butyloxycarbonyl-Gly-Arg-Arg-amido-4-methylcoumarin (Boc-GRR-AMC) in a wide pH range. As shown in Fig. 5a, both Atmc4 and Atmc9 have prominent activity toward GRR. The corresponding catalytic cysteine mutants were not active at all (see also below). For Atmc4, optimal buffer pH was 7.5–8.0, with detectable activity in the pH range of 6.5 to 9.0. Interestingly, the pH optimum for Atmc9 activity was 5.0–5.5 (pH range 4.5 to 6.0), whereas activity at the physiological pH of the cytoplasm (7.0–7.5) was completely abolished. To explore substrate P1 preference, proteolytic activities of purified Atmc4 and Atmc9 were tested against additional oligopeptide substrates with an arginine or lysine at the P1 position; benzyloxycarbonyl-Phe-Arg-amido-4-methylcoumarin (Z-FR-AMC), Boc-GRR-AMC, t-butyloxycarbonyl-Gly-Lys-Arg-AMC (Boc-GKR-AMC), d-VKKR-AMC, and H-Ala-Phe-Lys-AMC (AFK-AMC). All tested P1 arginine substrates are indeed cleaved by both Atmc4 and Atmc9, albeit at different efficiencies (Fig. 5b). Noteworthy, Atmc9 also showed some activity toward the P1 lysine substrate H-AFK-AMC. To confirm that type II metacaspases prefer basic rather than acidic P1 residues, we tested whether Atmc4 and Atmc9 could cleave the caspase substrates Ac-DEVD-AMC, Ac-YVAD-AMC, and ZVAD-AMC. None of the caspase substrates were cleaved by the metacaspases (Fig. 5b). To exclude the possibility that specific experimental conditions would impair the measurement of caspase activity in our assays, we cloned and purified human caspase 7 as a His6-tag fusion in the same vector as the Arabidopsis metacaspases and assessed its potential to cleave caspase substrates. As shown in Fig. 5b, recombinant human caspase 7 efficiently hydrolyzed Ac-DEVD-AMC and also Ac-YVAD-AMC, although at hardly measurable efficiency. On the other hand, human caspase 7 did not cleave any of the arginine/lysine substrates. These results demonstrate that caspase substrates cannot be cleaved by Arabidopsis Atmc4 and Atmc9 and are, hence, very unlikely to be responsible for the caspase-like activities in plants reported in literature. Effect of Protease Inhibitors on the Activity of Type II Metacaspases—We assessed the effect on Atmc4 and Atmc9 of several protease inhibitors with Boc-GRR-AMC as substrate (Table I). First, we tested the caspase inhibitors Z-YVAD-chloromethyl ketone (cmk), Z-DEVD-cmk, and Z-VAD-cmk. However, none of these compounds could block metacaspase activity at concentrations up to 100 μm. Also, the cathepsin B inhibitor Z-FA-fmk had no effect as well at this concentration.Table IEffect of different protease inhibitors on the activity of Atmc4 and Atmc9 with Boc-GRR-AMC as substrateReagentConcentrationActivityAtmc4Atmc9%Z-YVAD-cmk100 μm97 ± 599 ± 9Z-DEVD-cmk100 μm94 ± 1494 ± 8Z-VAD-fmk100 μm90 ± 7103 ± 1Z-FA-fmk100 μm97 ± 492 ± 3Chymostatin100 μm14 ± 210 ± 1Soybean trypsin inhibitor100 μg/ml34 ± 050 ± 4Pepstatin100 μm66 ± 169 ± 0Benzamidine5 mm2 ± 15 ± 1Iodoacetamide10 mm0 ± 03 ± 0PMSF1 mm23 ± 098 ± 14E-64100 μm44 ± 293 ± 6Aprotinin5 μg/ml114 ± 11113 ± 7Leupeptin1 μm12 ± 15 ± 1Antipain1 μm6 ± 01 ± 1Z-FK-tbmk1 μm5 ± 012 ± 0TLCK250 μm41 ± 50 ± 0TLCK1 μm79 ± 50 ± 1TPCK250 μm72 ± 079 ± 6 Open table in a new tab Of the broad-spectrum inhibitors tested, only chymostatin, a reversible serine and cysteine protease inhibitor, and to a lesser extent soybean trypsin inhibitor and pepstatin could block metacaspase activity at 100 μm.

The end result of this enzymatic cascade is a covalent isopeptide bond linking the C-terminal glycine of SUMO to the ∈-amino group of specific lysines in the target protein. Sumoylation of a target protein in this manner can regulate protein function by a number of different mechanisms including altering its subcellular localization, modulating its interaction with other proteins, or by antagonizing its attachment to ubiquitin or other lysine-targeting modifications. Desumoylation of substrates by SUMO isopeptidases, such as Ulp1p and Ulp2p in yeast, is also a central feature in regulation of protein function by SUMO (8Li S.J. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1999; 398: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar, 9Li S.J. Hochstrasser M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2367-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 10Li S.J. Hochstrasser M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 1069-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Genetic data in both budding and fission yeast, as well as the variety of known SUMO targets in mammalian cells, point to a broad role for sumoylation and desumoylation in the regulation of many biological processes including transcription, cell cycle progression, DNA damage response, and signal transduction (11Schwienhorst I. Johnson E.S. Dohmen R.J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2000; 263: 771-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 12Seeler J.S. Dejean A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 690-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar).It is known that a large number of proteins are sumoylated in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but very few of these substrates have been identified to date. This is thought to be due to the low abundance of the sumoylated targets and the fact that only a small fraction of a substrate is sumoylated under a given set of conditions. A critical step in the effort to gain a more complete picture of the role of SUMO in eukaryotic biology will be the identification and characterization of a wider range of SUMO targets. To this end, we have performed a global proteomics analysis of sumoylation in budding yeast.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESYeast Strains—EJ337 contains at the chromosomal SMT3 locus a version of SMT3 encoding eight histidines between the third and fourth residues, giving the N-terminal sequence MSDHHHHHHHHSEV... This allele was constructed with a HIS3 marker at the 3′ end of SMT3 using overlap PCR as described previously (13Johnson E.S. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 981-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The tagged locus was sequenced and contains no additional mutations. Strains expressing Cdc10p, Rad51p, Rpb4p, Prp45p, Rsc2p, and Vps72p C-terminally tagged with the HA and His8-containing sequence GYPYDVPDYAAFLHHHHHHHH were constructed by transforming strain JD52 with PCR fragments that introduced this sequence followed by a HIS3 marker at the chromosomal loci.Purification of SUMO Conjugates for Mass Spectrometry—The His8-Smt3p and control purifications were performed essentially as described (13Johnson E.S. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 981-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). EJ337 and the JD53 control strains were each grown in 6 liters of YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose) to an A600 of 1.8. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed in 1.85 n NaOH and 7.5% β-mercaptoethanol, and the proteins in the resulting lysate were precipitated by the addition of trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 20%. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation, washed in acetone, and resuspended in Buffer A (6 m guanidine HCl, 100 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 20 mm imidazole). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation with pH adjusted to 8.0 using NaOH and incubated with Ni-nitroacetic acid NTA-agarose (Qiagen) for 2 h at room temperature. Ni-NTA-agarose was then washed extensively in Buffer A followed by Buffer B (8 m urea, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mm imidazole). Proteins bound to the Ni-NTA were eluted by the addition of Buffer C (Buffer B + 500 mm imidazole), trichloroacetic acid-precipitated, and analyzed by mass spectrometry. Small aliquots of these purifications were also analyzed by immunoblotting with α-Smt3p antisera and silver staining (Fig. 1B).Identification of Proteins by Mass Spectrometry—Trichloroacetic acid precipitates from the His8-Smt3p and control purifications were resuspended in digestion buffer (8 m urea, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5) and digested by the sequential addition of Lys-C and trypsin proteases as previously described (14McDonald W.H.

The digests were then fractionated using microscale two-dimensional liquid chromatography and analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry using a Finnigan LTQ ion trap mass spectrometer. Multidimensional chromatography was performed on-line according to MacCoss et al. (15MacCoss M.J. McDonald W.H. Saraf A. Sadygov R. Clark J.M. Tasto J.J. Gould K.L. Wolters D. Washburn M. Weiss A.

Tandem mass spectra were collected in data-dependent fashion by collecting one full MS scan (m/z range = 600–1600) followed by MS/MS spectra of the eight most abundant precursor ions. The collection of resulting spectra was then searched against a data base of yeast open reading frames obtained from Saccharomyces Genome Data bank using the SEQUEST algorithm (16Eng J. McCormack A. Yates III, J.R. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1994; 5: 976-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (5361) Google Scholar). Peptide identifications were organized and filtered using the DTASelect program (17Tabb D.L. McDonald W.H. Yates III, J.R. J. Proteome Res. 2002; 1: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). Filtering criteria for positive protein identifications in the Smt3p purification were the identification of two unique fully tryptic peptides with Xcorr values greater than 2.0 for +1 spectra, 2.2 for +2 spectra, and 3.75 for +3 spectra. The filtering for the control purification used the same Xcorr thresholds but required only one unique fully tryptic peptide for identification.Confirmation of SUMO Substrates by Immunoblotting—Strains expressing TAP-tagged forms of putative SUMO targets were purchased from Open Biosystems.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5509-5519Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). 50-ml cultures of TAP strains ± pRS315-PGAL-His6-FLAG-Smt3p were grown on selective medium containing 2% galactose to an A600 ∼1.2. Cells were collected by centrifugation, and lysates were prepared as described above. Purifications were performed using Ni-NTA spin columns (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Ni-NTA eluates were trichloroacetic acid-precipitated, resuspended in Laemmli loading buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Immunoblotting for the presence of the TAP-tagged protein was performed using α-calmodulin-binding peptide antisera kindly provided by Jonathan Weissman. HA-His8-tagged version of Cdc10p, Rad51p, Rpb4p, Prp45p, Rsc2p, and Vps72p were affinity-purified from the appropriate strains using essentially the same approach as described above. Purifications were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with either α-HA or α-Smt3p.RESULTSPurification of Smt3p-conjugated Proteins from His8-Smt3p-expressing Yeast—To affinity-purify Smt3p-conjugated proteins from S. cerevisiae, we first constructed a yeast strain in which His8-tagged Smt3p was expressed from its original chromosomal location under the control of its endogenous promoter. Importantly, sumoylation patterns in this strain as assessed by immunoblotting of whole cell extracts with anti-Smt3p antisera were very similar to sumoylation patterns in the wild-type parental strain in both asynchronous cells and in cells treated with nocadazole (Fig. 1A). The small mobility shift in the sumoylation patterns between the two strains is due to the presence of the His8 affinity tag on Smt3p. We have previously found that sumoylation patterns in yeast overexpressing Smt3p can differ significantly from sumoylation patterns in wild-type yeast, which can lead to the spurious identification of SUMO targets (data not shown). Furthermore, we have found that the use of even a slightly larger epitope tag such as His6-FLAG or HA appeared to reduce SUMO attachment to some proteins, even when the tagged SUMO was overexpressed (data not shown). SUMO-conjugated proteins were then affinity-purified from the His8-Smt3p-expressing yeast strain under denaturing conditions using Ni-NTA-agarose. A mock purification from an untagged Smt3p strain was also performed as a control. Immunoblotting with anti-Smt3p antisera showed a high degree of enrichment of Smt3p conjugates after the affinity purification compared with the control purification (Fig. 1B). Both control and His8-Smt3p affinity purifications were also analyzed by silver staining (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, very few differences in staining patterns could be found between the two samples. Thus, even though Smt3p was highly enriched after affinity purification, the abundance of the SUMO conjugates was still quite low compared with the non-sumoylated yeast proteins that bound nonspecifically to the affinity matrix.Identification of Smt3p Substrates Using Multidimensional Protein Identification Technology—The extremely low abundance of the enriched SUMO conjugates compared with the large amount of contaminants makes the identification of sumoylated targets technically challenging. By relying on multidimensional protein identification technology (MudPIT) previously developed in our laboratory coupled with newer more sensitive instrumentation, we were able to analyze both the control and His8-Smt3p affinity-purified proteins (18Washburn M.P. Wolters D. Yates III, J.R. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 242-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (4053) Google Scholar, 19Wolters D.A. Washburn M.P. Yates III, J.R. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 5683-5690Crossref PubMed Scopus (1557) Google Scholar). Each protein mixture was digested with Lys-C and trypsin proteases, fractionated using on-line multidimensional microscale chromatography, and analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry. Peptide sequences and their corresponding proteins were identified by correlating the fragmentation spectra with the predicted fragmentation spectra from a yeast protein data base using the SEQUEST algorithm (16Eng J. McCormack A. Yates III, J.R. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1994; 5: 976-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (5361) Google Scholar). In total, 5047 peptides from 704 proteins were identified from the His8-Smt3p sample using minimum criteria of two fully tryptic peptides (peptides whose sequence at both termini is consistent with the known cleavage specificity of trypsin) per locus and Xcorr cutoffs of 2.0 for +1 spectra, 2.2 for +2 spectra, and 3.75 for +3 spectra. 2171 peptides from 574 proteins were identified in the control sample using identical Xcorr cutoffs but only one fully tryptic peptide per locus. Upon comparison of the two samples, 271 proteins were found to be unique to the His8-Smt3p sample and represent putative sumoylation targets. A complete list of all of the proteins found in these samples can be found in supplementary material.As a whole, the list of putative SUMO substrates appears to be of high quality. Most previously identified SUMO targets were identified in this approach including Cdc3p, Cdc11p, Shs1p, Pol30p, and Top2p (13Johnson E.S. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 981-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 20Bachant J. Alcasabas A. Blat Y. Kleckner N. Elledge S.J. Mol.

Commun. 1999; 259: 582-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Pds5p and Ycs4p were the only published Smt3p conjugates not identified by our approach (23Stead K. Aguilar C. Hartman T. Drexel M. Meluh P. Guacci V. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 729-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 24D'Amours D. Stegmeier F. Amon A. Cell. 2004; 117: 455-469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The identification of previously identified SUMO targets strongly supports the validity of our approach and suggests that most of the 271 proteins identified in our study are likely to be bona fide SUMO substrates.Although the 271 proteins uniquely identified in the Smt3p purification provide a plethora of new substrates to be characterized, this list is not comprehensive and it is likely that there are some proteins erroneously classified as negatives. There are three potential sources of false negatives in this study. The first potential is that some sumoylated proteins may be of extremely low abundance and below the level of detection in our analysis. This is the probable reason that we were unable to identify Pds5p and Ycs4p in our investigation. A second potential cause of these misclassified negatives is that, if a protein had bound to Ni-NTA-agarose in the strain where Smt3p was not tagged, it was excluded from our list of putative SUMO targets. However, it is likely that some of these proteins, which include almost 10% of yeast proteins, are still authentic sumoylated substrates. We have found that, whereas a protein may bind to Ni-NTA-agarose in both strains at low levels, its relative abundance as estimated by spectral count may be significantly higher in Smt3p-tagged strains versus the control strain. For example, although Cdc48p was present in both Smt3p and control purifications, 15 unique peptides and 35 different spectra were identified for Cdc48p in the Smt3p purification compared with only 4 unique peptides and 15 spectra in the control purification. As recent work has shown that differences in spectra count can reflect differences in protein abundance, it is likely that Cdc48p was enriched to a greater extent in the SUMO purification and is potentially a SUMO substrate (25Gao J. Opiteck G.J. Friedrichs M.S. Dongre A.R. Hefta S.A. J. Proteome Res. 2003; 2: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 26Liu H. Sadygov R. Yates III, J.R. Anal. Chem. 2004; 14: 4193-4201Crossref Scopus (2055) Google Scholar). Indeed, the immunoblotting experiments presented later in Fig. 2A identify Cdc48p as a legitimate sumoylation substrate. Nonetheless, the mere presence of these potential SUMO conjugates in the control purification prevents global conclusions from being made regarding their sumoylation status and makes it necessary to analyze them on an individual basis. A third possible cause for false negatives is the filtering criteria used in this analysis. The criteria for filtering the Smt3p purification data was very stringent, requiring a correct protein identification to have at least two fully tryptic peptides identifications above the Xcorr cutoffs described earlier. In this case, many proteins identified by a single unique but high quality peptide identification were excluded from our analysis, although many of these are still potentially sumoylation targets but probably present at very low levels. A list of these one-peptide identifications can be found in supplementary material. To ensure reasonable quality of these one peptide identifications, we included only those peptides that were independently identified by at least two different spectra and by two separate search algorithms (SEQUEST and Pep_Probe) (16Eng J. McCormack A. Yates III, J.R. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1994; 5: 976-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (5361) Google Scholar, 27Sadygov R.G. Yates III, J.R. Anal. Chem. 2003; 75: 3792-3798Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar).Fig. 2Confirmation of sumoylation substrates by immunoblotting.A, Cdc11p, Cdc48p, Nop2p, Rsc58p, Pre2p, Cdc14p, Swc1p, and Pob3p are in vivo sumoylation substrates. Ni-NTA purifications were performed from strains expressing TAP-tagged versions of Cdc11p, Cdc48p, Nop2p, Rsc58p, Pre2p, Cdc14p, Swc1p, and Pob3p and either a plasmid expressing His-FLAG-Smt3p from a galactose-inducible promoter or no plasmid as a control. These purifications were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting (IB) with α-calmodulin-binding peptide antisera to detect the presence of the TAP-tagged protein. B, Rpb4p, Prp45p, Rsc2p, and Vps72p are sumoylated in vivo. Ni-NTA purifications were performed from strains expressing C-terminally HA-His -tagged versions of four putative substrates (Rpb4p, Prp45p, Rsc2p, and Vps72p) and two negative controls (Cdc10p and Rad51p). These purifications were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with either α-HA or α-Smt3p to detect the fusion protein or SUMO, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)As in any large scale analysis, it is also important to note that some of the putative SUMO substrates identified in our analysis will be incorrect (false positives). We have taken several steps in an attempt to minimize the false positive rate in our study. We have used very stringent filtering criteria as described earlier. The false positive rate for peptide identification using these criteria was estimated using a decoy data base approach to be <1% (28Peng J. Elias J.E. Thoreen C.C. Licklider L.J. Gygi S.P. J. Proteome Res. 2003; 2: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (1371) Google Scholar). A false positive could also arise when a protein that binds nonspecifically to the affinity matrix is not identified in the control purification. To partially address this concern, we lowered the criteria for protein identifications from the control purification as compared with the Smt3p purification (one peptide minimum versus two peptide minimum) to generate a more comprehensive but less reliable list of background proteins.Confirmation of Smt3p Targets by Immunoblotting—To further establish the legitimacy of our proteomics results, we confirmed that a subset of the putative sumoylation substrates could be verified by immunoblotting. Strains in which putative targets were chromosomally TAP-tagged were transformed with a plasmid expressing His6- and FLAG-tagged Smt3p under the control of a galactose-inducible promoter. TAP-Cdc11, a septin known to be sumoylated, was used as a positive control (13Johnson E.S. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 981-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). These strains were grown in medium containing galactose and lysed under denaturing conditions. Smt3p conjugates were then purified using Ni-NTA-agarose and analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies against the calmodulin-binding peptide portion of the TAP tag. TAP-tagged strains not expressing tagged Smt3p were used as negative controls. Fig. 2A shows the presence of TAP-Cdc11p, TAP-Pre2p, TAP-Nop2p, TAP-Rsc58p, TAP-Cdc14p, TAP-Cdc48p, TAP-Swc1p, and TAP-Pob3p in the Ni-NTA purification from His6-FLAG-Smt3p-expressing strains but not in the corresponding control strains, indicating that these candidate SUMO targets are indeed authentic in vivo SUMO substrates. To ensure that all of the TAP-tagged proteins are not sumoylated in this assay, we also tested several TAP-tagged proteins not found to be sumoylated in our proteomic analysis (TAP-Cor1p, TAP-Nde1p, TAP-Arf1p, TAP-Pho88p) and were unable to detect their sumoylation (data not shown).As a second approach to confirming our proteomics analysis, we also constructed yeast strains in which a His8-HA tag was fused to the C terminus of Rpb4p, Prp45p, Rsc2p, and Vps72p. Rad51p and Cdc10p, which were not identified in our proteomic analysis, were also tagged as negative controls. These fusion proteins were purified using Ni-NTA-agarose, analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with either α-Smt3 or α-HA antibodies. Rpb4p, Prp45p, Rsc2p, and Vps72p were all found to be sumoylated under these conditions, whereas Cdc10p sumoylation was extremely weak and no sumoylation of Rad51p was detected (Fig. 2B). Together, these results further authenticate our mass spectrometry data and provide added confidence in the quality of our list of putative SUMO substrates.Categorization of SUMO Targets by Gene Ontology (GO) Annotations and Subcellular Localization—A detailed analysis of the sumoylation substrates identified in our study reveals a number of interesting trends and patterns that could not be ascertained by the investigation of individual proteins. Fig. 3A shows a histogram of the sumoylation targets categorized by GO-Slim biological process annotations, which is composed of very broad functional classifications. This histogram clearly demonstrates the diversity of processes potentially associated with sumoylation. Beyond the expected role of SUMO in transcription, DNA metabolism, and transport, these results suggest other roles for sumoylation in a wide range of processes including RNA metabolism, protein catabolism, and protein biosynthesis. Moreover, a large number of sumoylation targets have not yet been ascribed a role in any known biological process, making them interesting candidates for further investigation.Fig. 3Categorization of SUMO substrates by GO-Slim annotation and subcellular localization.A, histogram showing the identification of SUMO substrates in a diverse range of biological processes.

ER, endoplasmic reticulum.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Categorizing proteins by GO-Slim annotations separates proteins into very broad categories. To search for the clustering of SUMO substrates into more specific processes, we used the Gene Ontology Term finder tool on the Saccharomyces Genome Data bank to look for the categorical overrepresentation of GO annotations for a specific process in the SUMO candidate list compared with the entire yeast genome (www.yeastgenome.org) (29.Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar). A binomial distribution is used to calculate the probability that the fraction of sumoylation candidates mapped to a given biological function (GO process) could occur by chance given the fraction of all of the yeast proteins that map to that function. A representative subset of the biological processes that are associated with the sumoylation target list with a p value of <0.05 are shown in Table I. A complete list of the GO processes associated with sumoylation as well as the sumoylation substrates that map to those annotations can be found in supplementary material.Table IBiological processes regulated by sumoylationGO_termFrequencyProbabilityTranscription from pol I promoter9 of 271 genes, 3.3%1.42E-06Transcription from pol II promoter42 of 271 genes, 15.4%2.51E-15Transcription from pol III promoter11 of 271 genes, 4.0%1.58E-07RNA elongation from pol II promoter7 of 271 genes, 2.5%1.69E-05Covalent chromatin modification13 of 271 genes, 4.7%9.40E-08Chromatin assembly/disassembly11 of 271 genes, 4.0%2.71E-09Chromatin remodeling43 of 271 genes, 15.8%1.11E-28Chromatin silencing12 of 271 genes, 4.4%1.86E-05Protein sumoylation4 of 271 genes, 1.4%4.23E-05Mitotic cell cycle17 of 271 genes, 6.2%0.002RNA processing23 of 271 genes, 8.4%0.00279DNA replication9 of 271 genes, 3.3%0.02116 Open table in a new tab Table I displays several interesting features with respect to the regulation of biological processes by sumoylation. Although Fig. 3A demonstrates the connection between sumoylation and transcription, Table I clearly shows the prevalence of sumoylation in many different facets of transcription including transcription by all three RNA polymerase complexes, transcriptional elongation by RNA polymerase II, and modulation of chromatin structure through both chromatin modification and remodeling. This is significant in that that prior work linking transcription to sumoylation has focused primarily on the sumoylation of transcription factors and some chromatin-modifying enzymes such as histone deacetylases (30Gill G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2003; 13: 108-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 31Verger A. Perdomo J. Crossley M. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Our data provide the first report of SUMO directly modifying basal transcription machinery, transcriptional elongation complexes, and histone acetylases (SAGA, Spt-Ada-Gcn5-acetyltransferase complex) as well as multiple chromatin-remodeling complexes including Swr1p, Ino80p, and SWI/SNF. Clearly, the regulation of transcription by sumoylation is far more widespread than previously realized.In addition to the diversity of biological processes associated with SUMO, we find the presence of SUMO conjugates in a diverse range of subcellular locations. Recent work by Huh et al. (32Huh W.K. Falvo J.V. Gerke L.C. Carroll A.S. Howson R.W. Weissman J.S. O'Shea E.K. Nature. 2003; 425: 686-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (3256) Google Scholar) used genome-wide green fluorescent protein tagging of yeast open reading frames followed by fluorescence microscopy to determine the subcellular localization of >4100 yeast proteins. Taking advantage of this localization data, Fig. 3B shows a histogram depicting the number of SUMO substrates found in different subcellular compartments. Whereas the nucleus is by far the most abundant location for SUMO substrates, a large number of candidate targets can also be found in the cytoplasm and other subcellular structures. This is in good agreement with previous work suggesting that sumoylation is a predominantly nuclear process with a few notable cytoplasmic exceptions (12Seeler J.S. Dejean A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 690-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). An important caveat is that sumoylation is kno"

Here we show that deletion of the mouse gene Timp3 resulted in an increase in TNF-alpha converting enzyme activity, constitutive release of TNF and activation of TNF signaling in the liver. The increase in TNF in Timp3(-/-) mice culminated in hepatic lymphocyte infiltration and necrosis, features that are also seen in chronic active hepatitis in humans. This pathology was prevented when deletion of Timp3 was combined with Tnfrsf1a deficiency. In a liver regeneration model that requires TNF signaling, Timp3(-/-) mice succumbed to liver failure. Hepatocytes from Timp3(-/-) mice completed the cell cycle but then underwent cell death owing to sustained activation of TNF. This hepatocyte cell death was completely rescued by a neutralizing antibody to TNF. Dysregulation of TNF occurred specifically in Timp3(-/-), and not Timp1(-/-) mice. These data indicate that TIMP3 is a crucial innate negative regulator of TNF in both tissue homeostasis and tissue response to injury."

Chloroplasts in green algae and plants have evolved from a cyanobacterial endosymbiont. They contain a small genome that encodes ∼120 proteins and RNA molecules. Most chloroplast proteins are encoded by the nuclear genome, synthesized in the cytosol as precursors, and subsequently targeted to chloroplasts via an N-terminal chloroplast transit peptide (cTP). 1The abbreviations used are: cTP, chloroplast transit peptide; TMD, transmembrane domain; MS, mass spectrometry; LC, liquid chromatography; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry; ESI, electrospray ionization; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; TPP, three-phase partitioning; RP, reverse phase; PPDB, Plastid Proteome Database; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; CF, coupling factor; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization; EST, expressed sequence tag. This cTP is proteolytically removed after import in chloroplasts. Chloroplasts contain three membrane systems: a double membrane system of inner and outer envelopes, surrounding the organelle, and the thylakoid membrane system. Thylakoid membranes contain four major multisubunit protein complexes involved in photosynthesis (1Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar, 2Wollman F.A. Minai L. Nechushtai R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 21-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), comprising nearly 100 proteins; 65 of these have one or more transmembrane domains (TMDs) (3Friso G. Giacomelli L. Ytterberg A.J.

Subcellular prediction of all proteins encoded by the Arabidopsis nuclear genome using TargetP (4Emanuelsson O. Nielsen H. Brunak S. von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 1005-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (3616) Google Scholar) suggested that 4255 proteins have a cTP (14.9% of the total Arabidopsis proteome); at least 520 of these are predicted to have one or more TMDs and are located in the inner envelope or thylakoid membrane (5Sun Q. Emanuelsson O. van Wijk K.J. Plant Physiol. 2004; 135: 723-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Many of the proteins in the outer chloroplast envelope membrane typically do not have a cleavable cTP that can be predicted by the current subcellular localization predictors. These hydrophobic proteins are distributed between the envelope and the thylakoids via a sorting process that remains elusive. Recent proteomics studies on both membrane systems identified significant sets of proteins in and associated with the membrane system (3Friso G. Giacomelli L. Ytterberg A.J. Peltier J.-B. Rudella A.

This motivated us to further analyze the thylakoid membrane proteome and to develop a method that allows identification of low abundant proteins. 20–30% of the genes in any sequenced genome encode integral membrane proteins with one or more α-helical TMDs (8Krogh A. Larsson B. von Heijne G. Sonnhammer E.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (9154) Google Scholar). These membrane proteins fulfill critical functions in the transport of ions, small organic molecules, and proteins and in intra- and intercellular communication. Unfortunately, membrane proteomes are difficult to analyze experimentally because of their hydrophobic nature, resulting in insolubility and adsorption, and incompatibilities of ionic detergents with mass spectrometry. Different experimental strategies for large-scale identification of membrane proteins have been explored (reviewed in Ref. 9Wu C.C. Yates J.R. Nat.

Despite extensive efforts to synthesize nonionic detergents for separation of membrane proteins on two-dimensional gels with immobilized pH gradient strips in the first dimension, no significant membrane protein separation on two-dimensional electrophoresis gels with high dynamic resolution has been reported (10Santoni V.

CNBr cleavage of the insoluble fraction of yeast cells combined with extensive two-dimensional LC-MS/MS (MudPit) has also been successful in identification of yeast membrane proteins (17Washburn M.P. Wolters D. Yates J.R. II I Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 242-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (4089) Google Scholar). Recently, direct methanol extraction of membranes followed by in-solution trypsin digestion in buffered methanol of membrane fragments and nano-LC-electrospray ionization (ESI)-MS/MS was reportedly successful in identifying a significant fraction of integral membrane proteins (18Blonder J. Hale M.L. Lucas D.A. Schaefer C.F. Yu L.R. Conrads T.P. Issaq H.J. Stiles B.G. Veenstra T.D. Electrophoresis. 2004; 25: 1307-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 19Blonder J. Conrads T.P. Yu L.R. Terunuma A. Janini G.M. Issaq H.J. Vogel J.C. Veenstra T.D. Proteomics. 2004; 4: 31-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Despite these successes, simple and fast fractionation methods for membrane proteomes are lacking that (i) do not require HPLC, (ii) allow for removal of lipids and apolar pigments such as chlorophylls and carotenoids, (iii) allow processing of small amounts of membrane proteins, and (iv) are compatible with ESI-MS. Such off-line fractionation techniques are needed to reach dynamic resolutions that are sufficient to identify ion channels and transmembrane signal transducers as well as low abundance enzymes such as kinases and phosphatases. Three-phase partitioning (TPP) was originally developed in the 1950s to purify proteins using 1-butanol in the upper phase and (NH4)2SO4 and pH in the aqueous lower phase (20Penn N. Mackler B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1958; 27: 539-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Low speed centrifugation will induce an interphase with precipitated proteins above the aqueous phase because butanol bound to proteins increases their buoyancy (21Dennison C. Lovrien R. Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 11: 149-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The precipitated proteins are largely free of salts and are easy to resuspend. The amount of salt required to precipitate a protein varies inversely with the protein's molecular mass, and proteins precipitate most readily at their pI (22Pike R. Dennison C. Prep. Biochem. 1989; 19: 231-245PubMed Google Scholar). The method has previously been used for the purification of soluble proteins and recently for the purification of overexpressed proteins (23Yakhnin A.V. Vinokurov L.M. Surin A.K. Alakhov Y.B. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 14: 382-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 24Roy I. Gupta M.N. Anal.

However, this methodology has not been explored for integral membrane proteins. In this work, we have adapted the original TPP method to hydrophobic proteins and used this modified protocol to fractionate the proteome of salt-stripped thylakoids of chloroplasts from the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. After removal of SDS, fractionated membrane proteins were solubilized in (CH3)2SO, digested with trypsin, and analyzed by on-line reverse phase (RP)-nano-LC-ESI-MS/MS. In addition, protein fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE and in-gel digested with trypsin, followed by on-line RP-nano-LC-ESI-MS/MS. A total of 242 proteins were identified, at least 40% of which were predicted transmembrane proteins, and 50% of which were not identified in our earlier thylakoid membrane analysis (3Friso G. Giacomelli L. Ytterberg A.J. Peltier J.-B. Rudella A. Sun Q. van Wijk K.J. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 478-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Most of these proteins newly identified here have no predicted functions, and they include several proteins with DnaJ-like domains, rhodanese domains, or PPR/TPR domains. All proteins, together with thylakoid-associated proteins identified in other studies, were cross-checked against experimental analysis of the envelope membrane proteome surrounding the chloroplast. These 714 non-redundant proteins were classified in functional categories using an adapted classification developed for MapMan (26Thimm O. Blasing O. Gibon Y. Nagel A. Meyer S. Kruger P. Selbig J. Muller L.A. Rhee S.Y. Stitt M. Plant J. 2004; 37: 914-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (2548) Google Scholar) combined with information from KEGG, Aracyc, and functional domain predictors as well as primary literature. This analysis showed strong differentiation in cellular functions between the two membrane systems and elucidated the suborganellar location of many chloroplast membrane proteins. The data, including details of MS-based identification as well as functional classifications, can be extracted and searched via the Plastid Proteome Database (PPDB; ppdb.tc.cornell.edu/). Plant Growth and Thylakoid Preparations—A. thaliana (Columbia ecotype 0) was grown on soil with 10-h light/14-h dark periods at 22/19 °C (light/dark). Thylakoids were purified from fully developed leaves using a combination of differential and gradient centrifugation steps as described (3Friso G. Giacomelli L. Ytterberg A.J. Peltier J.-B. Rudella A. Sun Q. van Wijk K.J. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 478-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Removal of Water-soluble and Peripheral Thylakoid Proteins—The thylakoid membranes were resuspended at 10 mg/ml chlorophyll in ice-cold 10 mm Hepes containing a mixture of protease inhibitors as detailed previously (27Peltier J.-B. Emanuelsson O. Kalume D.E. Ytterberg J. Friso G. Rudella A. Liberles D.A. Soderberg L. Roepstorff P. von Heijne G. van Wijk K.J. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 211-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). The suspension was diluted 20 times with ice-cold solutions of 2 m KBr and KNO3 to reach a final concentration of 1 m each. The suspension was stirred slowly for 30 min on ice with 10-s sonication steps every 5 min. Membranes were collected by centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 25 min at 4 °C, washed with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8) to remove the remaining salts, and resuspended in solubilization buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 2% SDS, 5 mm TBP, and 6 m urea). The solubilized membranes were used as starting material for the TPP fractionation. Salt-extracted proteins in the supernatant (water-soluble and peripheral) were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid, left on ice for 15 min, and collected by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 25 min at 4 °C). The pellet was washed with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8) and resuspended in solubilization buffer. One-dimensional Electrophoretic Analysis—Proteins from the different samples were heated at 100 °C for 2 min and spun for 5 min at 14,000 × g prior to separation by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE. Proteins were separated on 24 × 18-cm Tricine/SDS/urea-polyacrylamide gels (8–15% acrylamide gradient) (28Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10480) Google Scholar). The gels were fixed, and proteins were visualized by high sensitivity silver staining (29Rabilloud T. Vuillard L. Gilly C. Lawrence J.J. Cell. Mol. Biol. (Noisy-Le-Grand). 1994; 40: 57-75PubMed Google Scholar), Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, or SYPRO Ruby (Molecular Probes, Inc.). Images of the gels were taken with an Amersham Biosciences Personal Densitometer™ II or FluorS (Bio-Rad). Extraction of Pigments and Fractionation of Hydrophobic Membranes Using TPP—KBr/KNO3-treated thylakoid membranes (containing 20 mg of chlorophyll) were resuspended in solubilization buffer. Chlorophylls and carotenoids were removed prior to fractionation by sequential extractions with 1-butanol saturated with solubilization buffer with the objective to avoid interference with protein separation or MS. 1-Butanol was added to the solubilized membrane proteins at a 4:7 ratio to facilitate two-phase separation between a butanol-enriched upper phase and the aqueous lower phase. Since pigments (unlike proteins) preferentially partition to this upper phase, they could easily be removed by collecting the pigment-enriched upper phase (after shaking the upper and lower phases and spinning the tubes for 5 min at 7000 × g). The upper phase was then replaced with a fresh upper phase. Five extractions were necessary to remove the pigments from the lower phase. Once the pigments were removed, fractionation of the hydrophobic membrane proteins was achieved either by stepwise increasing the (NH4)2SO4 concentration or by stepwise shifting the pH. After each step, an interphase (or third phase) consisting of precipitated proteins was collected between the upper and lower phases and resuspended in solubilization buffer by sonication. Six fractions were collected using six different steps: 1) TPP1, addition of 55 mm (NH4)2SO4 (crystals); 2) TPP2, a shift from pH 8 to 5 with Mes (50 mm final concentration); 3) TPP3, addition of (NH4)2SO4 to 275 mm; 4) TPP4, saturation of the solution with (NH4)2SO4; 5) TPP5, shift to very low pH (∼1) by addition of phosphoric acid (150 mm final concentration); and 6) TPP6, shift to very high pH (∼14) by addition of sodium hydroxide (400 mm final concentration). No proteins were detected in the collected upper phases. Protein Digestion, MS Analysis, and Extraction of MS Data—More than 700 protein spots were excised manually from the one-dimensional gels. The spots were automatically washed, digested with modified trypsin (Promega) (30Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7819) Google Scholar), and extracted using the ProGest robot (Genomic Solutions, Ann Arbor) as summarized previously (3Friso G. Giacomelli L. Ytterberg A.J. Peltier J.-B. Rudella A. Sun Q. van Wijk K.J. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 478-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). For in-solution digestion, aliquots from the dissolved TPP fractions were precipitated, and SDS was removed as principally described (31Puchades M. Westman A. Blennow K. Davidsson P. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1999; 13: 344-349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were precipitated with 100% acetone for 30 min at -20 °C. Precipitates were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed, and a solution of 80% acetone, 10% methanol, and 0.2% acetic acid was added. The samples were incubated for 30 min at -20 °C, followed by centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The residual acetone was removed by vacuum centrifugation. Because it has been reported that trypsin is active in 10% Me2SO (32Heller M. Mattou H. Menzel C. Yao X. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2003; 14: 704-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), we solubilized the proteins in 100% Me2SO for 20 min, followed by dilution with digestion buffer (final concentrations of 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate and 10% Me2SO; 1:20 (w/w) trypsin/protein ratio). The proteins were digested overnight at 37 °C. The Me2SO was then removed by vacuum centrifugation of the peptide mixtures. All samples were analyzed using nano-LC-ESI-MS/MS in automated mode on a quadrupole/orthogonal acceleration time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometer (Micromass Q-TOF1). Details for on-line RP-HPLC were described previously (33Peltier J.-B. Ripoll D.R. Friso G. Rudella A. Cai Y. Ytterberg J. Giacomelli L. Pillardy J. van Wijk K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4768-4781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The spectra were used to search the public data bases (downloaded locally) automated via in-house Mascot (Matrix Science). When searching Mascot, the maximum peptide and fragment errors were 1.2 and 0.8 Da, respectively. The probability-based Mowse score, the number of matching peptides, and the highest peptide score were extracted from the Mascot peptide summary report pages using in-house written software. The minimum criteria for identification were as follows: (i) one matching peptide with a peptide score higher than the minimum significant (p < 0.05) individual ion score, (ii) two matching peptides with a peptide score >21, or (iii) three matching peptides with a peptide score ≥20. Since >50% of Arabidopsis proteins are part of multigene families, protein identifications were verified for ambiguities resulting from the presence of multigene families or conserved domains. This was largely automated via software written inhouse. Proteins that were not identified with any “unique” peptides (which are not shared with any other protein entries) were manually verified, and peptides were ignored if a better fit to the MS/MS spectrum could be found in a higher ranking entry. The highest peptide score, the probability-based Mowse score from the peptide summary report, and the number of matching peptides as well as remaining ambiguities can be directly seen in PPDB when searching an accession number. All identifications based on one matching peptide or low mascot scores were manually verified, and all proteins that were identified only once were carefully considered. The Plastid Proteome Database—The construction of PPDB was described previously (3Friso G. Giacomelli L. Ytterberg A.J. Peltier J.-B. Rudella A. Sun Q. van Wijk K.J. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 478-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). PPDB contains the theoretical analysis of all Arabidopsis entries (currently Release 4.0 of ATH1.pep, with 28,581 nuclear encoded Arabidopsis proteins as well as the mitochondrial and plastid genomes). Predicted TMDs from the Aramemnon Database (aramemnon.botanik.uni-koeln.de/) are from Release 1.2. Compared with the earlier PPDB release, the Mascot scores, the number of matching peptides, and the higher peptide score for each identification as well as functional classification are listed. Ambiguous identifications of members of multigene families can be directly viewed in PPDB. Miscellaneous—Chlorophyll concentrations were determined spectrometrically in 80% acetone (34Porra R.J. Thompson W.A. Kriedemann P.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 975: 384-394Crossref Scopus (4694) Google Scholar), and protein determination was done using BCA (35Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18643) Google Scholar). The latest genome-wide analysis of the predicted Arabidopsis proteome suggested that the chloroplast proteome contains 520 proteins with one or more TMDs when using TMHMM as the predictor (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/) (5Sun Q. Emanuelsson O. van Wijk K.J. Plant Physiol. 2004; 135: 723-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). When using the consensus prediction listed in the latest release (Release 1.2) of the Aramemnon Database, 728 proteins with TMDs were found. These integral membrane proteins can be part of the thylakoid membrane or inner envelope membrane. The number of integral membrane proteins in the outer membrane is unknown because we cannot predict proteins in this membrane system (most do not have cTPs). Currently, fewer than 200 integral membrane proteins in the thylakoid and envelope membrane systems together have been identified, despite significant experimental efforts in both membrane systems. These efforts included substantial fractionation with organic solvents of salt-stripped thylakoid and envelope membranes, followed by ESI-MS/MS, as well as one-dimensional gels combined with on-line nano-LC-MS/MS (3Friso G.

Christopher W. Sjolander K. Gruissem W. Baginsky S. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 354-362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). In addition, many integral membrane proteins were initially identified via genetic tools and more “traditional” protein analyses (see Ref. 5Sun Q. Emanuelsson O. van Wijk K.J. Plant Physiol. 2004; 135: 723-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To identify additional integral membrane proteins or proteins that are tightly bound to the thylakoid via lipid anchors or short helical structures parallel to the membrane plane, we specifically developed a new fractionation protocol based on a so-called “three-phase partitioning” technique using t-butyl alcohol, originally successfully developed for soluble proteins (21Dennison C. Lovrien R. Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 11: 149-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). These TPP protocols were adapted here to membrane proteins using salt-stripped thylakoid membranes as our target proteome (Fig. 1, A and B). This adaptation comprises essentially the switch from t-butyl alcohol to 1-butanol, addition of solubilization buffer (SDS, urea, and TBP) to the upper and lower phases, as well as selection of appropriate (NH4)2SO4 concentrations and pH shifts. We chose to use 1-butanol because it does not require any addition of (NH4)2SO4 to form a two-phase system, which proved important for the fractionation of membrane proteins. The 1-butanol was saturated with SDS solubilization buffer to avoid depleting the SDS from the lower phase during the extraction of pigments and massive precipitation of the hydrophobic proteome. It should be pointed out that 1-butanol is only poorly miscible in water (maximum of 7%, w/v), but this increases up to ∼20% when SDS and urea are added (data not shown). Prior to the 1-butanol fractionation, the salt-stripped thylakoid membranes were solubilized with urea, SDS, and reductant to dissociate the lipids and to denature proteins and protein complexes. In addition, this liberated the large amount of apolar pigments (chlorophylls and carotenoids) from their protein carriers in the thylakoid membranes. Stripping of the membrane was carried out with 1 m KBr and 1 m KNO3 combined, and we found this very effective (see “Experimental Procedures” for details) (Fig. 2, A and B). This detergent/lipid/pigment/protein mixture was then mixed with 1-butanol at a 4:7 ratio, leading to partitioning of chlorophylls and carotenoids to the organic upper phase (Fig. 1, A and B). The pigment-enriched upper phase was then removed and replenished with new 1-butanol. Four successive extractions were necessary to completely remove the pigments from the lower phase. Analysis of these pooled upper phases showed that they contained only very small amounts of proteins from carryover (data not shown). Fig. 1B shows the efficiency of the pigment extraction; whereas the butanol phase from the first extraction (fraction E1) was dark green, that from the last extraction (fraction E5) was almost colorless. During the extractions (TPP0), a red precipitate was formed (Fig. 1B) that was highly enriched in carotenoids and devoid of proteins (data not shown). Once the pigments were removed, the proteins were stepwise precipitated by changing the concentrations of (NH4)2SO4 or changing the pH in the solution (Fig. 1A). The interphases (TPP1–TPP6) collected during the fractionation were all white/gray, with the exception of TPP1, which was slightly green (Fig. 1B). Different (NH4)2SO4 concentrations and pH steps were tested, and the scheme presented in Fig. 1A was optimum for the thylakoid proteome. The amounts of proteins that precipitated in each TPP fraction were determined and tested for reproducibility by protein determinations and separation by SDS-PAGE (see legend to Fig. 1). Image analysis of four different gel-separated extractions stained with the fluorescent dye SYPRO Ruby also showed a very good reproducibility (Fig. 2C). Fig. 2 (A and B) shows the protein profiles (stained with silver or Coomassie Brilliant Blue)"
https://openalex.org/W1483147211,"T cell death-associated gene 8 (TDAG8) has been reported to be a receptor for psychosine. Ovarian cancer G-protein-coupled receptor 1 (OGR1) and GPR4, G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) closely related to TDAG8, however, have recently been identified as proton-sensing or extracellular pH-responsive GPCRs that stimulate inositol phosphate and cAMP production, respectively. In the present study, we examined whether TDAG8 senses extracellular pH change. In the several cell types that were transfected with TDAG8 cDNA, cAMP was markedly accumulated in response to neutral to acidic extracellular pH, with a peak response at approximately pH 7.0–6.5. The pH effect was inhibited by copper ions and was reduced or lost in cells expressing mutated TDAG8 in which histidine residues were changed to phenylalanine. In the membrane fractions prepared from TDAG8-transfected cells, guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) binding activity and adenylyl cyclase activity were remarkably stimulated in response to neutral and acidic pH. The concentration-dependent effect of extracellular protons on cAMP accumulation was shifted to the right in the presence of psychosine. The inhibitory psychosine effect was also observed for pH-dependent actions in OGR1- and GPR4-expressing cells but not for prostaglandin E2- and sphingosine 1-phosphate-induced actions in any pH in native and sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor-expressing cells. Glucosylsphingosine and sphingosylphosphorylcholine similarly inhibited the pH-dependent action, although to a lesser extent. Psychosine-sensitive and pH-dependent cAMP accumulation was also observed in mouse thymocytes. We concluded that TDAG8 is one of the proton-sensing GPCRs coupling to adenylyl cyclase and psychosine, and its related lysosphingolipids behave as if they were antagonists against protein-sensing receptors, including TDAG8, GPR4, and OGR1.

GPR4 also shares homology with TDAG8 and was identified as a receptor for lysolipids, including lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) and SPC (6Zhu K. Baudhuin L.M. Hong G. Williams F.S. Cristina K.L.

Nature. 2003; 425: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar), however, that OGR1 and GPR4 sense extracellular protons through histidine residues of receptors and are coupled to G-proteins to stimulate intracellular signaling pathways. Thus, OGR1 stimulation causes inositol phosphate production, and the subsequent mobilization of intracellular calcium and GPR4 stimulation induces cAMP accumulation, probably reflecting the activation of adenylyl cyclase in response to an extracellular pH change (7Ludwig M.G. Vanek M. Guerini D. Gasser J.A. Jones C.E. Junker U. Hofstetter H. Wolf R.M. Seuwen K. Nature. 2003; 425: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). These results raise the possibility that TDAG8 may also respond to extracellular pH change and stimulate intracellular signaling pathways. If TDAG8 is proven to be one of the pH-sensing receptors, the next issue is the relationship between two putative ligands, lysolipid and proton, with respect to the action mechanism; that is, do the two ligands recognize these proton-sensing receptors independently of each other? In a previous study (7Ludwig M.G. Vanek M. Guerini D. Gasser J.A. Jones C.E. Junker U. Hofstetter H. Wolf R.M. Seuwen K. Nature. 2003; 425: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar), the specific action of SPC, a putative OGR1 agonist, could not be observed in OGR1-expressing cells. In the present study, we observed that TDAG8 senses extracellular pH and stimulates adenylyl cyclase and the subsequent accumulation of cellular cAMP. Mutagenesis experiments on TDAG8 suggest that histidine residues may play a role in proton sensing. Furthermore, we observed that psychosine and its related lysosphingolipids inhibited the proton-sensing responses in a manner that is dependent on extracellular pH in the cells expressing not only TDAG8 but also OGR1 and GPR4. Thus, TDAG8 is one of the proton-sensing GPCRs that is sensitive to psychosine and its related lysosphingolipids. These lipids behave as if they were antagonists for the proton-sensing GPCRs and may be useful tools for characterization of this group of receptors. Materials—Psychosine (galactosylsphingosine), glucosylsphingosine, SPC, d-erythro-sphingosine, and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) were purchased from Sigma. 1-Oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate (lysophosphatidic acid), l-α-lysophosphatidylcholine palmitoyl (LPC, C16:0), and sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) were from Cayman Chemical Co. (Ann Arbor, MI). Fatty acid-free BSA was from Calbiochem-Novabiochem; PTX was from List Biological Laboratories, Inc. (Campbell, CA); anti-Gαs/Gαolf (C-18) antibody, a polyclonal antibody raised against a peptide mapping at the C-terminal Gαs, and the C-terminal peptide for the blocking were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); and myo-[2-3H]inositol (23.0 Ci/mmol) was from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc. (St. Louis, MO). A 14-peptide fragment of muscarinic receptor m4I3C was synthesized as described previously (8Kuribayashi F. Nunoi H. Wakamatsu K. Tsunawaki S. Sato K. Ito T. Sumimoto H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6312-6320Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Mice—C57BL/6 mice (females, 5 weeks of age) were obtained from Charles River Japan, Inc. (Tokyo, Japan). Sterile food and water were fed to the mice ad libitum. The mice were sacrificed within 1 week according to procedures approved by the Gunma University Animal Care Committee. Preparation of Receptor cDNA Plasmids and Expression—The entire coding regions of TDAG8 (1014 bp, GenBank™ accession no. NM_003608), OGR1 (1098 bp, GenBank™ accession no. U48405), and GPR4 (1089 bp, GenBank™ accession no. NM_005282) were amplified from a human cDNA library by RT-PCR. The respective amplified fragment was subcloned into the EcoRI site of a pEFneo expression vector (9Kon J. Sato K. Watanabe T. Tomura H. Kuwabara A. Kimura T. Tamama K. Ishizuka T. Murata N. Kanda T.

Brain Res. 2000; 85: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) for TDAG8 and OGR1, and a pIRESneo expression vector for GPR4. Each DNA sequence was then confirmed. The 5′ primers contained an EcoRI site, a Kozak sequence (CCACC), and the N-terminal region of the respective receptor. The 3′ primers contained an EcoRI site and a stop codon in addition to the C-terminal region of the respective receptor. CHO cells or RH7777 cells were transfected with the respective plasmids by electroporation, and the neomycin-resistant (G418 sulfate at 1 mg/ml for CHO cells and 0.5 mg/ml for RH7777 cells) cells were selected. CHO cells resistant to G418 were used in bulk, whereas RH7777 cells expressing TDAG8 receptor were cloned by limiting the dilution. Subsequently, two clonal RH7777 cells expressing TDAG8 (C2 or C6) were isolated. TDAG mutants were generated by PCR-based mutagenesis and cloned into BamHI/EcoRI sites of pcDNA 3.1 (Invitrogen) to generate pcDNA-H10F, pcDNA-H14F, or pcDNA-H243F, in which the 10th, 14th, or 243rd position of histidine from the N terminus was changed to phenylalanine, respectively. Wild type human TDAG8 was also cloned into pcDNA3.1 to generate pcDNA-WT. These mutated or wild type TDAG8 constructs were transfected into COS7 cells by electroporation to let them transiently express in the cells (11Tomura H. Itoh H. Sho K. Sato K. Nagao M. Ui M.

Cell Cultures—Permanent cell lines of CHO cells and RH7777, which were transfected with empty plasmids (pEFneo and pIRESneo) or the respective receptor plasmid (pEFneoTDAG8, pEFneoOGR1, pEFneoS1P3 (9Kon J.

For cAMP and inositol phosphate assays, the cells were plated on 12-well multiplates. Twenty-four hours before the experiments, the medium was changed to fresh DMEM (without serum) containing 0.1% BSA for the cAMP response and to TCM199 medium containing 2 μCi of [3H]inositol (in 1 ml) and 0.1% BSA. PTX treatment of the cells was performed by adding the toxin (100 ng/ml) to the medium 18 h before the experiments. COS7 cells transiently transfected with pcDNA-WT, pcDNA-H10F, pcDNA-H14F, pcDNA-H243F, and pcDNA3.1 were cultured for 2 days in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, and the medium was replaced with fresh DMEM containing 0.1% BSA 24 h before the experiments. Thymocytes (5 × 107 cells/ml) were cultured in 10 ml of RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in the presence or absence of 1 μm dexamethasone (DEX). After the appropriate time (2 and 4 h, respectively), cells were harvested and used for the measurement of mRNA expression and cAMP assay. Accumulation of cAMP in Intact Cells—The cells, except for thymocytes, were washed once and preincubated for 10 min at 37 °C in HEPES-buffered medium (pH 7.6) consisting of 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 134 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 2mm CaCl2, 2.5 mm NaHCO3, 5 mm glucose, and 0.1% (w/v) albumin-free BSA (fraction V). The cells were then incubated for 30 min under the indicated pH level in the presence of 0.5 mm IBMX in a final volume of 0.5 ml. To cover a wider pH range, the incubation medium was buffered with a HEPES/EPPS/MES mixture (8 mm each). Where indicated, appropriate test agents were supplemented with the incubation medium. All data in this report are referenced to the pH at room temperature. The reaction was terminated by adding 100 μl of 1 n HCl. Although the HEPES/EPPS/MES-buffered medium was used for the cAMP response in intact CHO, RH7777, and COS7 cells, we did not detect any significant difference between the response of the HEPES-buffered medium and the HEPES/EPPS/MES-buffered medium, at least in the cAMP response in RH7777 cells. In the case of thymocytes, the harvested cells were washed once with the HEPES-buffered medium (pH 7.6) and suspended with the same medium (2 × 108 cells/ml). The cell suspensions (100 μl) were added to the reaction medium, which contained 0.98 mm IBMX, under the appropriate pH (105 μl) and were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by adding 30 μlof1 n HCl. Cyclic AMP in the acid extract was measured as described previously (9Kon J. Sato K. Watanabe T. Tomura H. Kuwabara A. Kimura T. Tamama K.

Inositol Phosphate Production—The [3H]inositol-labeled CHO cells transfected with the respective receptors were washed once and preincubated with the HEPES-buffered medium (pH 7.6) for 10 min. The cells were then incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in HEPES/EPPS/MES-buffered medium under the appropriate pH in the presence of 10 mm LiCl. Total inositol phosphates, including inositol mono-, di-, and triphosphate, were measured as described previously (9Kon J. Sato K. Watanabe T. Tomura H. Kuwabara A. Kimura T. Tamama K. Ishizuka T.

GTPγ35S Binding Assay—The membrane fractions were prepared from vector- and TDAG8-transfected RH7777 cells with 50 mm HEPES-buffered medium (pH 7.4) containing 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 mm sucrose, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin as described previously (9Kon J. Sato K. Watanabe T. Tomura H. Kuwabara A. Kimura T. Tamama K. Ishizuka T. Murata N. Kanda T. Kobayashi I. Ohta H. Ui M. Okajima F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23940-23947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The binding assay was performed by incubating the membranes (25 μg) with GTPγ35S for 30 min at 30 °C as described previously (12Ohta H. Sato K. Murata N. Damirin A. Malchinkhuu E. Kon J. Kimura T. Tobo M. Yamazaki Y. Watanabe T. Yagi M. Sato M. Suzuki R. Murooka H. Sakai T. Nishitoba T. Im D.S. Nochi H. Tamoto K. Tomura H. Okajima F. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 994-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), except that the pH of the assay medium was changed. In brief, membranes (100 μl of medium at pH 7.4) were incubated with the assay medium under the appropriate pH (900 μl) in final concentrations of 0.1 nm GTPγS(∼2 × 105 dpm/ml), 10 μm GDP, 50 mm HEPES, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, and 25 μg/ml saponin. The reaction was terminated by adding 3 ml of an ice-cold 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 100 mm NaCl followed by an immediate filtration under vacuum through a Whatman GF/C glass fiber filter (24-mm diameter). The filter was washed twice with the same buffer and dried at 60 °C for 1 h before being counted for radioactivity. Adenylyl Cyclase Activity in a Cell-free System—The same membrane fractions that were prepared for the GTPγ35S binding assay were used for the adenylyl cyclase assay. The membranes (50 μg in 50 μl) were incubated with the assay medium under the appropriate pH (450 μl) in final concentrations of 0.5 mm IBMX, 0.2 mm ATP, 7 mm phosphocreatine, 30 units/ml creatine phosphokinase, 0.1 nm GTPγS, and 10 μm GDP in 50 mm HEPES-buffered medium containing 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, and 25 μg/ml saponin for 15 min at 30 °C. In the experiment in which the effect of antibody for Gαs was examined, membranes were preincubated with the antibody (100 μg/ml) for 2.5 h at 4 °C. Reaction was terminated by adding 100 μl of 1 n HCl. Quantitative RT-PCR Using Real-time TaqMan Technology—Total RNA was isolated using TRI reagent (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After DNase I (Promega, Madison, WI) treatment to remove possible traces of genomic DNA contaminating the RNA preparations, 5 μg of the total RNA was reverse-transcribed using random priming and Multiscribe reverse transcriptase according to the manufacturer's instructions (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). To evaluate the expression level of the OGR1 (GPR68), TDAG8 (GPR65), and GPR4 mRNAs, quantitative RT-PCR was performed using real-time TaqMan technology with a sequence detection system model 7700 (Applied Biosystems). The mouse OGR1-, GPR4-, and TDAG8-specific probes were obtained from Assay-on-Demand products (identification nos. Mm00558545 for OGR1, Mm00433695 for TDAG8, and Mm00558777 for GPR4) (Applied Biosystems). TaqMan probe, sense primer, and antisense primer of mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were synthesized as follows: 5′-FAM-ATTTGGCCGTA-TTGGGCGCC-TAMRA-3′, 5′-GACAAAATGGTGAAGGTCGG-3′, and 5′-CAATCTCCACTTTGCCACTG-3′, respectively. Other experimental conditions were described previously (13Yamada T. Sato K. Komachi M. Malchinkhuu E. Tobo M. Kimura T. Kuwabara A. Yanagita Y. Ikeya T. Tanahashi Y. Ogawa T. Ohwada S. Morishita Y.

The expression level of the target mRNA was normalized to the relative ratio of the expression of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA. Each RT-PCR assay was performed at least three times, and the results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Data Presentation—All experiments were performed in duplicate or triplicate. The results of multiple observations are presented as the mean ± S.E. or as representative results from more than three different batches of cells unless otherwise stated. Statistical significance was assessed by the Student's t test; values were considered significant at p < 0.05. TDAG8 Senses Extracellular pH Resulting in cAMP Accumulation—We first examined cAMP accumulation in CHO cells transfected with vector plasmid and TDAG8 cDNA. To evaluate adenylyl cyclase activity, IBMX, an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase, was included in the assay medium. As shown in Fig. 1A, in vector-transfected CHO cells a slightly acidic pH of 6.9 did not change the basal cAMP level and somewhat decreased PGE2- and forskolin-induced cAMP accumulation compared with accumulation levels induced at pH 7.8. Thus, slight acidification of extracellular pH seems to decrease the apparent activity of Gs or the catalytic activity of adenylyl cyclase. On the other hand, in the TDAG8-transfected cells, the slightly acidic pH remarkably increased the basal cAMP level, whereas PGE2 and forskolin effects were roughly additive to the high basal activity. The maximal response was observed at pH 6.8 (Fig. 1B). The cAMP response to pH was insensitive to PTX (Fig. 1B), treatment of which completely suppressed the S1P-induced inhibition of cAMP accumulation in the presence of forskolin (data not shown). These results suggest that Gi proteins are not involved in the proton-sensing response. As shown later (see Fig. 5), the extracellular pH change caused a remarkable inositol phosphate accumulation in OGR1-transfected cells, but no significant effect on inositol phosphate response was detected by a pH change in either vector-transfected or TDAG8-transfected CHO cells (Fig. 1C).Fig. 5Psychosine inhibited pH-dependent responses in the cells transfected with proton-sensing GPCRs.A and B, TDAG8-transfected CHO cells were incubated for inositol phosphate (A) and cAMP (B) responses to the indicated pH in the presence (•) or absence (○) of 10 μm psychosine. C, TDAG8 cells were incubated at pH 7.0 in the presence of the indicated concentrations of psychosine (Psy), glucosylsphingosine (GlcPsy), SPC, LPC, and sphingosine (Sph). D, GPR4-transfected CHO cells were incubated under the indicated pH in the presence (•) or absence (○) of 10 μm psychosine. For GPR4 expression plasmid, we used pIRESneo vector instead of pEFneo vector; however, pIRESneo vector-transfected CHO cells did not respond to extracellular pH either (data not shown). E, OGR1-transfected CHO cells were incubated for inositol phosphate response to pH in the presence (•) or absence (○) of 10 μm psychosine.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The effect of the extracellular pH change in cAMP accumulation was also observed in RH7777 cells when transfected with TDAG8 cDNA, whereas no significant effect was detected in response to the pH change in vector-transfected cells (Fig. 2A). Even if the cAMP response reflects the activity of adenylyl cyclase, it is still possible that TDAG8 receptor stimulation indirectly activates the enzyme through intracellular and extracellular signaling mechanisms. To clarify this point, we prepared crude membranes from these cells and analyzed GTPγS binding activity and adenylyl cyclase activity in the cell-free system. As shown in Fig. 2B, a change in pH in the medium significantly stimulated GTPγS binding in the membranes, probably reflecting the increase in the guanine nucleotide binding to G-proteins. Thus, a proton behaves as a typical receptor ligand for GPCR. In these membrane preparations from cloned cells, the activity of the components of the adenylyl cyclase system seemed to be almost identical to that of the vector-transfected bulk cell membranes, as evidenced from the finding that the activity elicited by the catalyst activator forskolin, Gs-coupling β-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol, or Gi stimulator m4I3C, a 14-peptide fragment of muscarinic receptor (8Kuribayashi F. Nunoi H. Wakamatsu K. Tsunawaki S. Sato K. Ito T. Sumimoto H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6312-6320Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), was unchanged (Fig. 2C) at pH 7.97. An increase in proton concentration in the assay medium, however, caused a remarkable increase in the activity up to pH 7.3, and then the activity declined with the acidification of the medium, which was probably caused by the inhibition of the availability of the active substrate Mg2+ATP for the enzyme. Indeed, with increasing proton concentration, the basal enzyme activity was gradually reduced in membranes prepared from the vector-transfected cells (Fig. 2D). Gs proteins may mediate the proton-induced adenylyl cyclase activation as evidenced by a significant inhibition of the proton-induced enzyme activation by anti-Gαs/Gαolf antibody (Fig. 2E). The inhibitory effects of the antibody were prevented by co-incubation with the cognate peptide (data not shown). This antibody has been shown to recognize Gαs but not Gαo, Gαi1, Gαi2, Gαi3, or Gαq (14Cussac D. Pasteau V. Millan M.J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2004; 485: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Thus, TDAG8 receptors seem to couple to G-proteins and probably Gs proteins, and a proton may accelerate the guanine-nucleotide exchange and induce the subsequent activation of adenylyl cyclase. In the case of OGR1-expressing cells, CuCl2 was effective in inhibiting the proton-induced response, probably by stabilizing the unprotonated state of histidine pairs (7Ludwig M.G. Vanek M. Guerini D. Gasser J.A. Jones C.E. Junker U. Hofstetter H. Wolf R.M. Seuwen K. Nature. 2003; 425: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). The proton-sensing cAMP response in TDAG8-expressing cells was almost completely inhibited by CuCl2 (Fig. 3A), whereas the S1P-induced response was hardly affected by the metal cation (Fig. 3B). The involvement of histidine residues was also supported by experiments in which cAMP accumulation in COS7 cells transiently transfected with the wild type or mutated form of TDAG8 cDNAs was analyzed. As shown in Fig. 4, a mutation at a certain position of the histidine residues (H10F, H14F, or H243F) in TDAG8 inhibited the proton-dependent cAMP accumulation with a low maximal activity and a high apparent half-maximal effective concentration. The change in the ED50 does not seem to be the result of the low expression of the mutant receptor protein because a decrease in the amount of transfected wild type DNA changed the maximal activity but did not appreciably change the ED50 value (Fig. 4). The mutation in His-10 is equivalent to His-17 in OGR1 as His-14 is to His-17 in GPR4 (7Ludwig M.G. Vanek M. Guerini D. Gasser J.A. Jones C.E. Junker U. Hofstetter H. Wolf R.M. Seuwen K. Nature. 2003; 425: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar), and both mutations are located in extracellular N-terminal sites. Thus, these extracellular histidine residues may play a role in sensing extracellular protons. On the other hand, His-243 is equivalent to His-245 in OGR1 and is located in helix VI facing the lipid environment. The mutation in this position resulted in a marked reduction in the proton-sensing response as was the case in OGR1, suggesting that the position may be required for overall structural integrity (7Ludwig M.G. Vanek M. Guerini D. Gasser J.A. Jones C.E. Junker U. Hofstetter H. Wolf R.M. Seuwen K. Nature. 2003; 425: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar).Fig. 4Mutation of histidines on TDAG8 receptors resulted in inhibition of proton-sensing cAMP response in COS7 cells. COS7 cells were transiently transfected with 20 μg of pcDNA-WT (WT), pcDNA-H10F (H10F), pcDNA-H14F (H14F), pcDNA-H243F (H243F), or pcDNA3.1 (Vector), and cAMP response to the indicated pH was then measured. When the cells were transfected with 2.1 or 7 μg of pcDNA-WT, the maximal value was 20 or 40% of that observed in transfected cells (20μg). On the other hand, the ED50 value was pH 6.90, 6.98, and 6.92 for cells transfected with 2.1, 7, and 20 μg of pcDNA-WT, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Inhibition by Psychosine and Related Lysolipids of Proton-sensing Responses—TDAG8 has recently been reported (4Im D.S. Heise C.E. Nguyen T. O'Dowd B.F. Lynch K.R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 429-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) to be a receptor for psychosine. Similarly, OGR1 and GPR4 have also been shown to be receptors for lysolipids such as SPC and LPC (5Xu Y. Zhu K. Hong G. Wu W. Baudhuin L.M. Xiao Y. Damron D.S. Nat.

As shown in Fig. 5A, however, we failed to detect a significant effect of psychosine on inositol phosphate response at any pH level in TDAG8-transfected CHO cells. On the other hand, the concentration-dependent cAMP-response curve of the proton was shifted to the right in the presence of psychosine (Fig. 5B). Thus, psychosine behaves as if it was an antagonist when TDAG8 was stimulated with the proton. Other lysolipids, including glucosylsphingosine and SPC, although to a lesser extent than psychosine, also inhibited the cAMP response to the neutral pH in TDAG8-transfected cells.

Exposure of human spermatozoa to a concentration gradient of progesterone (0–3 μm) to simulate approach to the oocyte induced a slowly developing increase in [Ca2+]i upon which, in many cells, slow oscillations were superimposed. [Ca2+]i oscillations often started at very low progesterone (<10 nm), and their frequency did not change during the subsequent rise in concentration. Oscillations also occurred, but in a much smaller proportion of cells, in response to stepped application of progesterone (3 μm). When progesterone was removed, [Ca2+]i oscillations often persisted or quickly resumed. Superfusion with low-Ca2+ bathing medium (no added Ca2+) did not prevent [Ca2+]i oscillations, but they could be abolished by addition of EGTA or La3+. Inhibitors of sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPases or inositol trisphosphate signaling had no effect on [Ca2+]i oscillations, but pharmacological manipulation of ryanodine receptors affected both their frequency and amplitude. Staining of live spermatozoa with BODIPY FL-X ryanodine showed localization of ryanodine binding primarily to the caudal part of the head and mid-piece. [Ca2+]i oscillations did not induce acrosome reaction, but in cells generating oscillations, the flagellar beat mode alternated in synchrony with the oscillation cycle. Flagellar bending and lateral movement of the sperm head during [Ca2+]i peaks were markedly increased compared with during [Ca2+]i troughs. This alternating pattern of activity is likely to facilitate zona penetration. These observations show that progesterone initiates unusual and complex store-mediated [Ca2+]i signaling in human spermatozoa and identify a previously unrecognized effect of progesterone in regulating sperm “behavior” during fertilization.

Inositol trisphosphate receptors and sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPases have been localized to the acrosome and mid-piece, and permeabilized human spermatozoa have been shown to contain a releasable store of Ca2+ (9Kuroda Y.

Androl. 2003; 26: 366-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).The best characterized agonist of [Ca2+]i signaling in mammalian spermatozoa is the zona pellucida, which surrounds the oocyte. The zona pellucida induces elevations in [Ca2+]i upon sperm contact, resulting in AR at the zona surface (14Bailey J.L. Storey B.T. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1994; 39: 297-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 15Florman H.M. Dev. Biol. 1994; 165: 152-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The zona pellucida-activated [Ca2+]i signal in mouse spermatozoa is initially generated by Ca2+ influx through a voltage-operated Ca2+ channel. There is good evidence for subsequent participation of a low capacity (or fractionally filled) Ca2+ store in this process, but the function of store mobilization is to permit activation of store-operated Ca2+ channels rather than to provide a significant source of Ca2+ (16O'Toole C.M. Arnoult C. Darszon A. Steinhardt R.A. Florman H.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1571-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Progesterone, which is synthesized by and present in mammalian cumulus (17Osman R.A. Andria M.L. Jones A.D. Meizel S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Reprod. 2003; 68: 1193-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), also causes elevations in [Ca2+]i and is the best characterized agonist of human spermatozoa. As with the response to the zona pellucida, stimulation with progesterone induces a “sim ple” signal by Ca2+ influx (20Blackmore P.F. Beebe S.J. Danforth D.R. Alexander N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1376-1380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Plant A. McLaughlin E.A. Ford W.C.L. Fertil. Steril. 1995; 64: 1213-1215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This involves at least two influx pathways, but their identity is far from clear (22Guzman-Grenfell A.M. Gonzalez-Martinez M.T. J. Androl. 2004; 25: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, a small proportion of progesterone-stimulated human spermatozoa generate large slow [Ca2+]i oscillations, possibly reflecting store mobilization (23Kirkman-Brown J.C. Barratt C.L.R. Publicover S.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 827-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).That responsiveness of human spermatozoa to progesterone is correlated with fertilization success in vitro (24Krausz C. Bonaccorsi L. Maggio P. Luconi M. Criscuoli L. Fuzzi B. Pellegrini S. Forti G. Baldi E. Hum. Reprod. (Oxf.). 1996; 8: 1661-1667Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar) indicates its biological significance, but the role of progesterone in fertilization is poorly understood. Micromolar doses of progesterone induce AR, but the relevance of this response for fertilization in vivo is disputed (22Guzman-Grenfell A.M. Gonzalez-Martinez M.T. J. Androl. 2004; 25: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 25Wassarman P.M. Jovine L. Litscher E.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E59-E64Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Progesterone is also reported to induce hyperactivation, a vigorous swimming pattern caused by marked changes in flagellar beating. Hyperactivated motility is adopted by sperm as they gain the ability to fertilize and is characteristic of cells retrieved at the site and time of fertilization (4Suarez S.S. Ho H.C. Reprod. Domest. Anim. 2003; 38: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar).Progesterone is present in the cumulus at micromolar concentrations (17Osman R.A. Andria M.L. Jones A.D. Meizel S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 160: 828-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), but human spermatozoa respond to the hormone at nanomolar doses (26Baldi E. Casano R. Falsetti C. Krausz C. Maggi M. Forti G. J. Androl. 1991; 12: 323-330PubMed Google Scholar, 27Harper C.V. Kirkman-Brown J.C. Barratt C.L.R. Publicover S.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 407-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Spermatozoa will therefore detect cumulus-derived progesterone, distributed by diffusion and/or ciliary currents, prior to encountering the oocyte zona cumulus. Furthermore, the progesterone stimulus encountered by the spermatozoa is likely to occur as a concentration gradient, which the cell ascends as it approaches the oocyte. Previous studies on the action of progesterone on spermatozoa have used stepped application. To understand better the response of human spermatozoa to the progesterone stimulus that they encounter in vivo, we have exposed human spermatozoa to a rising logarithmic progesterone concentration gradient. Cells stimulated in this way respond with novel and complex changes in [Ca2+]i and flagellar activity, generated by an unusual mechanism.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—All chemicals were cell culture-tested grade where available. Oregon Green BAPTA-1/AM and BODIPY FL-X ryanodine were from Molecular Probes, Inc. Aristolochic acid, caffeine, cyclopiazonic acid, 2,4-dinitrophenol, Me2SO, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), FITC-conjugated Pisum sativum agglutinin, Pluronic F-127, progesterone, poly-l-lysine, neomycin, ryanodine, tetracaine, thapsigargin, and 8-(diethylamino)octyl 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoate (TMB-8) were from Sigma. (2-Aminoethoxy)diphenylborate, SKF-96365, and U-73122 were products of Calbiochem. Fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin was from JRH Biosciences (Andover, United Kingdom). Drugs were dissolved as a concentrated stock solution in Me2SO (when necessary) and diluted in supplemented Earle's balanced salt solution (sEBSS; 0.3% bovine serum albumin) before application. Me2SO never exceeded 0.5% and was normally 0.1%. These doses of Me2SO had no effect on [Ca2+]i in human spermatozoa. The progesterone enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit was obtained from DRG Diagnostics.Preparation and Capacitation of Spermatozoa—Donors were recruited at Birmingham Women's Hospital. Highly motile spermatozoa were harvested into sEBSS as described previously (27Harper C.V. Kirkman-Brown J.C. Barratt C.L.R. Publicover S.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 407-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and were left to capacitate (to acquire the ability to fertilize, a process that normally occurs during residence in the female tract) for 6 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2.Imaging—Aliquots were loaded with Oregon Green BAPTA-1/AM and imaged in a continuously perfused chamber as described previously (27Harper C.V. Kirkman-Brown J.C. Barratt C.L.R. Publicover S.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 407-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Stepped (3 μm) progesterone stimuli and drugs were applied by addition to the perfusion header. 1 mm La3+ was applied in HEPES-buffered saline containing 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2), 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 0.3% bovine serum albumin (pH 7.4). All experiments were carried out at 25 °C unless stated otherwise. Data acquisition and storage were controlled by a PC running AQM Orca 2001 (Kinetic Imaging Ltd., Nottingham, United Kingdom).Generation and Assessment of Gradient Stimuli—Progesterone gradients were generated using a five-chamber gradient maker (0, 3 nm,30 nm, 300 nm, and 3 μm progesterone) connected to the inflow of the imaging chamber. Gradient characteristics were assessed in two ways. To determine the time of initiation of the gradient and to assess smoothness/stability, an FITC gradient was generated using 0, 2, 10, 20, and 30 nm FITC. Fluorescence intensity in the imaging chamber was measured at 10-s intervals. The outflow from the imaging chamber was collected at various time points during a number of the gradient experiments, and progesterone was measured using the ELISA kit following the manufacturer's instructions.Single Cell Data Processing—Data were processed off-line using AQM Orca 2001 as described previously (27Harper C.V. Kirkman-Brown J.C. Barratt C.L.R. Publicover S.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 407-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Raw intensity values from the caudal part of the head of each sperm were imported into Microsoft Excel and normalized to pre-stimulus values. At each time point, the normalized fluorescence intensity values (R) for each cell were compiled to generate an overall average normalized head fluorescence (Rtot).The latency of response to gradient stimuli was estimated by comparing mean control fluorescence (at least 20 images immediately prior to stimulation) with each mean from a 10-point moving average (increment = 1). The response to the gradient stimulus was considered to have been initiated from the midpoint of the first 10-point sample at which there was a significant (and subsequently maintained) increase in fluorescence (p < 0.05) using unpaired Student's t test.Assessment of the Characteristics of [Ca2+]i Oscillations—Initial attempts to use Fourier analysis as an objective method to identify oscillating cells and to determine oscillation frequency were unsuccessful due to variability, particularly in the cycle period and in the base line upon which oscillations were superimposed. Traces that clearly incorporated repeated transitions between fluorescence levels (such as in Fig. 2a) generated noisy spectra in which the dominant frequency was often barely detectable, and oscillating cells could not be identified with any degree of reliability. Cells displaying oscillations in [Ca2+]i were therefore identified directly from time/fluorescence intensity plots. Only cells with cyclical changes in fluorescence, comprising repeated events of consistent characteristics, were categorized as oscillators. The period of [Ca2+]i oscillation in each cell was calculated by taking an average over 3–10 cycles.Flagellar Activity—Immediately following [Ca2+]i imaging, the field of cells was observed under phase-contrast microscopy (2 Hz for 12 min). We then selected cells that were well adhered to the slide but had a freely motile and clearly visible flagellum in the phase contrast images. A scale with 1.5-μm graduations was superimposed on the image, normal to the axis of the sperm, at a point on the flagellum (typically not >10 μm beyond the mid-piece) where the position could be detected in every frame. The point where the tail crossed this scale was then recorded for each image in the phase contrast series. The square of each frame/frame increment in tail position was calculated ((change in position in micrometers)2) and plotted as a 20-point moving average.Labeling with BODIPY FL-X Ryanodine—Capacitated spermatozoa (6 million cells/ml) were labeled with 2.5 μm BODIPY FL-X ryanodine for 30 min at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and then transferred to the imaging chamber. An additional 30-min incubation at 37 °C in 5% CO2 was then carried out for the cells to adhere. The chamber was connected to the perfusion apparatus, and 2 ml of medium was perfused through the chamber to remove excess dye.Assessment of Acrosomal Status—After collection of a series of Oregon Green BAPTA-1/AM images for assessment of [Ca2+]i signaling, the chamber was perfused with 100% methanol for 30 s and then washed with sEBSS. The field was bleached by exposure to fluorescent illumination for 30 s. (A control was carried out to confirm that this process did not significantly increase the number of acrosome-reacted cells.) FITC-conjugated P. sativum agglutinin (0.2 mg/ml) was introduced into the chamber and left for 45 min, and then distilled water was perfused through the chamber for 10 min. This procedure was carried out at 25 °C. An image of the field of view was captured, and the each cell was assessed for acrosomal status and related to the [Ca2+]i signaling activity from the preceding fluorescence image series. Approximately 15% of the cells were not scored for acrosomal status either because they were washed off during the staining stage or because we were not able to assess acrosomal status from the labeling pattern.Statistical Analysis—Proportions of oscillating cells, oscillation cycle frequency, and rates of AR were compared in Microsoft Excel using paired or unpaired t tests (two-tailed) as appropriate. Percentage data were arcsine-transformed before analysis. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. All data are presented as means ± S.E.RESULTSResponse to Stepped Progesterone TreatmentWe previously described the biphasic [Ca2+]i response of progesterone-stimulated human sperm (27Harper C.V. Kirkman-Brown J.C. Barratt C.L.R. Publicover S.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 407-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 28Kirkman-Brown J.C. Bray C. Stewart P.M. Barratt C.L.R. Publicover S.J. Dev. Biol. 2000; 222: 326-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Both population and single cell responses comprise a transient [Ca2+]i increase followed by a sustained elevation in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 1a). The response is dependent upon [Ca2+]o, occurs in ∼98% of viable cells, and is dose-dependent (27Harper C.V. Kirkman-Brown J.C. Barratt C.L.R. Publicover S.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 407-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).Fig. 1a, [Ca2+]i (normalized Oregon Green BAPTA-1/AM fluorescence) in the caudal part of the head of six cells stimulated with a 3 μm progesterone step (shown above the traces) showing the simple biphasic response. b, calibration of gradient stimulation. The five tubes of the gradient maker were filled with 0, 2, 10, 20, and 30 nm FITC, and the resulting gradient was perfused through the imaging chamber while taking measurements of fluorescence intensity at 10-s intervals. FITC at each of the concentrations was also perfused separately to calibrate this gradient. During progesterone gradient experiments, the gradient maker tubes contained 0, 3 nm, 30 nm, 300 nm, and 3 μm progesterone. The arrowheads show estimated times at which these concentrations would be present in the perfusion chamber based upon the FITC calibration. The inset shows results from ELISA analysis of progesterone (micromolar) in the chamber outflow during a progesterone gradient experiment. Gradients in the fluorescein calibration and in the experiment analyzed by ELISA were initiated after 4 min of recording. Measurements correlate well with calibration and show that, between 8 and 20 min, the increase in progesterone concentration is near logarithmic. c, [Ca2+]i in the caudal part of the head of seven cells in which [Ca2+]i increased gradually (similar to the population response) during stimulation with a progesterone gradient (3 nm to 3 μm; shown above the traces). The latency of the response varied considerably between cells, and [Ca2+]i often peaked before the maximum progesterone concentration. d, [Ca2+]i in the caudal part of the head of three cells, two of which generated slow oscillations superimposed on the [Ca2+]i ramp (blue and pink traces) during stimulation with a progesterone gradient (3 nm to 3 μm; shown above the traces). In one of these cells (pink trace), oscillation began within <3 min of the gradient start (<5 nm progesterone). The gradient was initiated after 5 min of recording. The inset shows an overlay of a phase contrast image with a fluorescence image of the same cell collected at the peak of an oscillation, illustrating the localization of the fluorescence signal to the caudal part of the head/mid-piece. e, pseudo-colored images from a series (collected at 0.1 Hz) showing two cells stimulated by a progesterone gradient. Neither cell generated an initial [Ca2+]i transient upon stimulation, but the lower cell displayed a series of [Ca2+]i oscillations (arrows) superimposed on the [Ca2+]i ramp induced by the stimulus.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Response to a Progesterone GradientTo simulate the progesterone stimulus during approach to the oocyte, we used a logarithmic progesterone gradient (0–3 μm) that started 4–5 min after commencing recording and developed over 20 min (see “Experimental Procedures”) (Fig. 1b). In contrast to the progesterone step-induced biphasic response, population responses (Rtot) showed a smooth ramped rise in [Ca2+]i that was detectable within <1 min of progesterone introduction and that usually peaked before the end of the progesterone gradient (latency of peak = 17 ± 1 min, n = 7). [Ca2+]i then stabilized or decreased slowly. Examination of single cell responses showed a similar pattern: cells generating a gradual increase in [Ca2+]i that often peaked before completion of the progesterone gradient and fell toward the end of the recording, possibly reflecting desensitization of the response (Fig. 1c). Phasic changes in [Ca2+]i, superimposed on the raised level of [Ca2+]i, were often observed (see below), but initial [Ca2+]i transients of the type characteristic of the response to stepped application of progesterone (Fig. 1a) never occurred. Transient responses of human spermatozoa to a stepped progesterone stimulus are well synchronized, with 98% of the cells responding within 20 s of progesterone application (27Harper C.V. Kirkman-Brown J.C. Barratt C.L.R. Publicover S.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 407-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In contrast, only 28 ± 3% of the cells generated a significant increase in [Ca2+]i (fluorescence exceeding control levels; p < 0.05) within the first 20 s after initiation of a progesterone gradient, with the response rate rising to 66 ± 1 and 96 ± 0.2% after 60 s and 5 min, respectively (seven experiments, 885 cells).Gradient Stimulation Induces Oscillations in [Ca2+]iIn addition to causing a slow increase in sperm [Ca2+]i, progesterone gradients induced slow [Ca2+]i oscillations in the caudal part of the head of more than one-third of the cells (34 ± 2%; oscillation period = 4.1 ± 0.3 min; seven experiments, 885 cells) (Fig. 1, d and e). The onset of oscillations varied between cells, but typically occurred within 3–10 min of gradient initiation, with 36 ± 5% of the cells generating the upstroke of the first oscillation within 4 min of gradient initiation (Fig. 1d), at a progesterone concentration of <10 nm according to gradient calibration. The subsequent increase in progesterone concentration was never reflected in a discernible increase in the frequency of oscillations, despite an increase in agonist concentration of ≥100-fold after oscillations commenced (Fig. 1d). Once established, oscillations continued throughout recording, although [Ca2+]i between cycles often decayed, similar to the response in non-oscillating cells (Fig. 1d, pink trace). The amplitude of oscillations was typically a 40–100% increase in fluorescence, at least as great as the [Ca2+]i transient evoked by 3 μm progesterone (Fig. 1a), which had an amplitude of 700 nm in fluorometric measurements (27Harper C.V. Kirkman-Brown J.C. Barratt C.L.R. Publicover S.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 407-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The kinetics of [Ca2+]i oscillations varied between cells, possibly reflecting cell/cell differences in Ca2+ mobilization and/or clearance processes.Progesterone Step-induced OscillationsExposure of capacitated human spermatozoa to a 3 μm progesterone step induced slow oscillations in [Ca2+]i in ≈10% of the cells after the initial transient response (23Kirkman-Brown J.C. Barratt C.L.R. Publicover S.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 827-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In stepped progesterone experiments carried out in parallel with our progesterone gradient experiments (Fig. 2a), 14 ± 2% of the cells displayed oscillations (nine experiments, 1346 cells), less than half as many as with gradient stimuli (p < 0.01) (Fig. 2b). In five instances, direct comparisons were made between paired aliquots from the same sample, prepared identically before exposure to either a stepped or gradient stimulus. Gradient stimuli were consistently more effective in activating oscillatory [Ca2+]i signaling (p < 0.01) (Fig. 2c). The period of oscillation in step-stimulated cells was typically 2–4 min (mean = 3.4 ± 0.2 min; six experiments, 525 cells), slightly shorter than the gradient-induced oscillation period of 4.1 ± 0.3 min (p < 0.05). In almost 30% of the oscillating cells activated by a progesterone step, [Ca2+]i returned almost to control levels between cycles (Fig. 2a), a pattern seldom observed in gradient-stimulated cells.To confirm that the recorded oscillations were not affected by aliasing, we investigated the effect of image acquisition frequency. The recorded rate, amplitude, and kinetics of the oscillations were independent of the rate at which images were collected (between 0.1 and 0.67 Hz). Fig. 2a shows two cells from an experiment in which the sampling rate was changed from 0.1 to 0.67 Hz after 15 min of recording.Temperature Sensitivity of [Ca2+]i OscillationsIn experiments at 31 and 37 °C (four experiments at each temperature; stepped progesterone stimuli), the proportions of cells displaying oscillations (5–15%) and the amplitudes of oscillations (typically a 40–50% increase in fluorescence) were similar to those observed at 25 °C. However, the kinetics (rise and fall) and oscillation rate were markedly temperature-sensitive. The oscillation period at 37 °C (0.39 ± 0.03 min; range of 0.2–0.6 min; four experiments, 298 cells) was 10 times shorter than that at 25 °C (3.4 ± 0.2 min). At 25 °C, the initial progesterone-induced [Ca2+]i transient often had an amplitude and kinetics similar to those of subsequent oscillations (Fig. 2a), but at 31 and 37 °C, the oscillations were much shorter than the transient (Fig. 2d), indicating that oscillations are not generated by periodic repetitions of the initial transient. This conclusion was supported by the observation that the first [Ca2+]i oscillation occasionally activated before decay of the initial [Ca2+]i transient and was superimposed upon it (data not shown). Because of the difficulty of applying drugs via the gradient maker and of maintaining stable recording conditions at temperatures above 25 °C, all subsequent studies in which saline manipulations and drug application were used for characterization of the processes underlying progesterone-induced oscillations were done using stepped progesterone stimuli at 25 °C.Is the Induction of Oscillations Reversible?After fertilization, the sperm no longer exists as a separate cell. Transformations of signaling and cell activity induced by stimuli during approach to the oocyte (such as progesterone) could therefore be irreversible. To investigate this possibility, we observed the effect of removing the progesterone stimulus on established [Ca2+]i oscillations. Three patterns of response were seen. In 10% of the cells generating [Ca2+]i oscillations, the effect of progesterone washout was essentially undetectable (Fig. 3a, □). In 40% of the cells, [Ca2+]i fell toward pre-stimulus levels but recovered discernibly within 1–2 min, and oscillations restarted (latency = 1.5–6 min after progesterone washout; seven experiments, 792 cells) (Fig. 3a, ▪). In the remaining 50% of the cells, oscillations ceased and did not restart, but these cells resumed oscillating immediately upon restorati"
https://openalex.org/W2140514427,"A new class of dominant dark skin (Dsk) mutations discovered in a screen of approximately 30,000 mice is caused by increased dermal melanin. We identified three of four such mutations as hypermorphic alleles of Gnaq and Gna11, which encode widely expressed Galphaq subunits, act in an additive and quantitative manner, and require Ednrb. Interactions between Gq and Kit receptor tyrosine kinase signaling can mediate coordinate or independent control of skin and hair color. Our results provide a mechanism that can explain several aspects of human pigmentary variation and show how polymorphism of essential proteins and signaling pathways can affect a single physiologic system."

https://openalex.org/W1969399174,"In this study, we tested the hypothesis that a CB(1) TMH3-4-5-6 aromatic microdomain, which includes F3.25(190), F3.36(201), W5.43(280), and W6.48(357), is centrally involved in CB(1) receptor activation, with the F3.36(201)/W6.48(357) interaction key to the maintenance of the CB(1)-inactive state. We have shown previously that when F3.36(201), W5.43(280), and W6.48(357) are individually mutated to alanine, a significant reduction in ligand binding affinity is observed in the presence of WIN 55,212-2 and SR141716A but not CP55,940 and anandamide. In the work presented here, we report a detailed functional analysis of the F3.36(201)A, F3.25(190)A, W5.43(280)A, and W6.48(357)A mutant receptors in stable cell lines created in HEK cells for agonist-stimulated guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTPgammaS) binding and GIRK1/4 channel current effects in Xenopus oocytes where the mutant proteins were expressed transiently. The F3.36(201)A mutation showed statistically significant increases in ligand-independent stimulation of GTPgammaS binding versus wild type CB(1), although basal levels for the W6.48(357)A mutant were not statistically different from wild type CB(1). F3.36(201)A demonstrated a limited activation profile in the presence of multiple agonists. In contrast, enhanced agonist activation was produced by W6.48(357)A. These results suggest that a F3.36(201)/W6.48(357)-specific contact is an important constraint for the CB(1)-inactive state that may need to break during activation. Modeling studies suggest that the F3.36(201)/W6.48(357) contact can exist in the inactive state of CB(1) and be broken in the activated state via a chi(1) rotamer (F3.36(201) trans, W6.48(357) g+) --> (F3.36(201) g+, W6.48(357) trans). The F3.36(201)/W6.48(357) interaction therefore may represent a toggle switch for activation of CB(1)."
https://openalex.org/W2143399007,"In mammalian cells, induced expression of arginase in response to wound trauma and pathogen infection plays an important role in regulating the metabolism of l-arginine to either polyamines or nitric oxide (NO). In higher plants, which also utilize arginine for the production of polyamines and NO, the potential role of arginase as a control point for arginine homeostasis has not been investigated. Here, we report the characterization of two genes (LeARG1 and LeARG2) from Lycopersicon esculentum (tomato) that encode arginase. Phylogenic analysis showed that LeARG1 and -2, like all other plant arginases, are more similar to agmatinase than to arginases from vertebrates, fungi, and bacteria. Never-theless, recombinant LeARG1 and -2 exhibited specificity for l-arginine over agmatine and related guanidino substrates. The plant enzymes, like mammalian arginases, were inhibited (Ki ∼ 14 μm) by the NO precursor NG-hydroxy-l-arginine. These results indicate that plant arginases define a distinct group of ureohydrolases that function as authentic l-arginases. LeARG1 and LeARG2 transcripts accumulated to their highest levels in reproductive tissues. In leaves, LeARG2 expression and arginase activity were induced in response to wounding and treatment with jasmonic acid (JA), a potent signal for plant defense responses. Wound- and JA-induced expression of LeARG2 was not observed in the tomato jasmonic acid-insensitive1 mutant, indicating that this response is strictly dependent on an intact JA signal transduction pathway. Infection of wild-type plants with a virulent strain of Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato also up-regulated LeARG2 expression and arginase activity. This response was mediated by the bacterial phytotoxin coronatine, which exerts its virulence effects by co-opting the host JA signaling pathway. These results highlight striking similarities in the regulation of arginase in plants and animals and suggest that stress-induced arginase may perform similar roles in diverse biological systems. In mammalian cells, induced expression of arginase in response to wound trauma and pathogen infection plays an important role in regulating the metabolism of l-arginine to either polyamines or nitric oxide (NO). In higher plants, which also utilize arginine for the production of polyamines and NO, the potential role of arginase as a control point for arginine homeostasis has not been investigated. Here, we report the characterization of two genes (LeARG1 and LeARG2) from Lycopersicon esculentum (tomato) that encode arginase. Phylogenic analysis showed that LeARG1 and -2, like all other plant arginases, are more similar to agmatinase than to arginases from vertebrates, fungi, and bacteria. Never-theless, recombinant LeARG1 and -2 exhibited specificity for l-arginine over agmatine and related guanidino substrates. The plant enzymes, like mammalian arginases, were inhibited (Ki ∼ 14 μm) by the NO precursor NG-hydroxy-l-arginine. These results indicate that plant arginases define a distinct group of ureohydrolases that function as authentic l-arginases. LeARG1 and LeARG2 transcripts accumulated to their highest levels in reproductive tissues. In leaves, LeARG2 expression and arginase activity were induced in response to wounding and treatment with jasmonic acid (JA), a potent signal for plant defense responses. Wound- and JA-induced expression of LeARG2 was not observed in the tomato jasmonic acid-insensitive1 mutant, indicating that this response is strictly dependent on an intact JA signal transduction pathway. Infection of wild-type plants with a virulent strain of Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato also up-regulated LeARG2 expression and arginase activity. This response was mediated by the bacterial phytotoxin coronatine, which exerts its virulence effects by co-opting the host JA signaling pathway. These results highlight striking similarities in the regulation of arginase in plants and animals and suggest that stress-induced arginase may perform similar roles in diverse biological systems. l-Arginine is one of the most functionally diverse amino acids in living cells. In addition to serving as a constituent of proteins, arginine is a precursor for the biosynthesis of polyamines, agmatine, and proline, as well as the cell-signaling molecules glutamate, γ-aminobutyric acid, and nitric oxide (1Wu G.Y. Morris S.M. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (2157) Google Scholar, 2Morris S.M. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2002; 22: 87-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 3Cederbaum S.D. Yu H.

Two of the most intensively studied pathways of arginine metabolism are those catalyzed by arginase and nitric-oxide synthase (NOS). 1The abbreviations used are: NOS, nitric-oxide synthase; l-NOHA, NG-hydroxy-l-arginine; LeARG, Lycopersicon esculentum arginase; JA, jasmonic acid; MeJA, methyl jasmonate; Pst, Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato; COR, coronatine; EST, expressed sequence tag; ODC, ornithine decarboxylase; ADC, arginine decarboxylase; COI1, coronatine-insensitive 1; CHES, 2-(cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid; TIGR, The Institute for Genomic Research; dpi, days post-infection.1The abbreviations used are: NOS, nitric-oxide synthase; l-NOHA, NG-hydroxy-l-arginine; LeARG, Lycopersicon esculentum arginase; JA, jasmonic acid; MeJA, methyl jasmonate; Pst, Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato; COR, coronatine; EST, expressed sequence tag; ODC, ornithine decarboxylase; ADC, arginine decarboxylase; COI1, coronatine-insensitive 1; CHES, 2-(cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid; TIGR, The Institute for Genomic Research; dpi, days post-infection. Arginase hydrolyzes arginine to urea and ornithine, the latter of which is a precursor for polyamine biosynthesis. Recent studies in animal systems indicate that increased arginase expression stimulates the production of polyamines that promote tumor cell proliferation (4Chang C.I. Liao J.C. Kuo L. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1100-1106PubMed Google Scholar), wound healing (5Satriano J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2003; 1009: 34-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and axonal regeneration following injury (6Cai D. Deng K. Mellado W. Lee J. Ratan R.R. Filbin M.T. Neuron. 2002; 35: 711-719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Jux-taposed to the growth-promoting effects of polyamines are the cytostatic effects of NO produced by activated macrophages. The switch between the arginase and NOS branches of arginine metabolism is controlled by various inflammatory signals that regulate arginase expression and arginine availability (2Morris S.M. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2002; 22: 87-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 7Lee J. Ryu H. Ferrante R.J. Morris Jr., S.M. Ratan R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nutr. 2002; 21: 273-279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Because arginase and NOS compete for a common substrate, increased arginase expression can effectively attenuate the NOS pathway, often with profound physiological consequences. A diversity of human pathogens, for example, induce arginase expression as a means of evading NO-mediated host defenses (10Duleu S. Vincendeau P. Courtois P. Semballa S. Lagroye I. Daulouede S.

Mossalayi M.D. Trends Parasitol. 2003; 19: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The interaction between the arginase and NOS pathways extends beyond the fact that they both use a common substrate. For example, the intermediate in the NOS-catalyzed production of NO, NG-hydroxy-l-arginine (NOHA), functions as a potent inhibitor of arginase (14Boucher J.L. Custot J. Vadon S. Delaforge M.

In contrast to our understanding of arginase regulation in animals, very little is known about the potential role of arginase as a metabolic control point for arginine homeostasis in higher plants. The well established role of NO in plant developmental and defense-related processes (16Durner J. Klessig D.F. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 1999; 2: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 17Wendehenne D. Pugin A. Klessig D.F. Durner J.

Sci. 2000; 25: 79-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), together with the recent discovery of two arginine-utilizing plant NOSs (19Chandok M.R. Ytterberg A.J. van Wijk K.J. Klessig D.F. Cell. 2003; 113: 469-482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 20Guo F.Q. Okamoto M. Crawford N.M. Science. 2003; 302: 100-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar), provides a strong rationale for addressing this question. Most studies of plant arginase have focused on its role in mobilizing arginine as a nitrogen source during post-germinative growth (21Splittstoesser W.E. Phytochemistry. 1969; 8: 753-758Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 22Kollöffel C. van Dijke H.D. Plant Physiol. 1975; 55: 507-510Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Wright L.C. Brady C.J. Hinde R.W.

Phytochemistry. 2001; 58: 1015-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Arginine can account for 50% of the nitrogen in seed protein, and up to 90% of the free nitrogen in vegetative tissues. In several plant species, including soybean, broad bean, pumpkin, Arabidopsis, and loblolly pine, nitrogen mobilization during seedling development is correlated with large increases in arginase expression (26Polacco J.C. Holland M.A. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1993; 145: 65-103Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 28Hwang H.J. Kim E.H. Cho Y.D. Phytochemistry. 2001; 58: 1015-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 29Todd C.D. Gifford D.J. Planta. 2002; 215: 110-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Seedling arginase catalyzes the breakdown of a significant portion of the arginine pool to ornithine and urea. Ornithine can support the biosynthesis of polyamines, proline, and glutamate, whereas urea is further catabolized by urease to carbon dioxide and ammonium. The coordinate action of arginase and urease is thought to recycle urea nitrogen to meet the metabolic demands of developing seedlings (26Polacco J.C. Holland M.A. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1993; 145: 65-103Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 30Zonia L.E. Stebbins N.E. Polacco J.C. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 1097-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms by which arginase expression in plants is regulated by developmental or stress-related cues remain to be determined. A prerequisite for addressing this question is the unambiguous identification of genes that encode plant arginase. cDNAs encoding putative arginases has been reported for Arabidopsis (31Krumpelman P.M. Freyermuth S.K. Cannon J.F. Fink G.R. Polacco J.C. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 1479-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), soybean (32Goldraij A. Polacco J.C. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and loblolly pine (33Todd C.D. Cooke J.E. Mullen R.T. Gifford D.J. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 45: 555-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The arginase superfamily is composed of enzymes that hydrolyze various guanidino substrates to a one-carbon nitrogen-containing product (e.g. urea) and a second product that retains the quaternary nitrogen at the site of hydrolysis. The family includes arginase, agmatinase, proclavaminate amidinohydrolase, formiminoglutamase, as well as several uncharacterized sequences from archaea and eubacteria (34Perozich J. Hempel J. Morris Jr., S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1382: 23-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 35Sekowska A. Danchin A. Risler J.L. Microbiology-UK. 2000; 146: 1815-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Because the predicted sequences of plant arginases are more similar to agmatinase and other arginase-like enzymes than to non-plant arginases from vertebrates, fungi, and bacteria, it was suggested that plant genes annotated as arginase may encode agmatinase or another amidinohydrolase activity involved in the production of secondary metabolites (34Perozich J. Hempel J. Morris Jr., S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1382: 23-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 35Sekowska A. Danchin A. Risler J.L. Microbiology-UK. 2000; 146: 1815-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Although an Arabidopsis arginase cDNA can genetically complement an arginase-deficient yeast mutant (31Krumpelman P.M. Freyermuth S.K. Cannon J.F. Fink G.R. Polacco J.C. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 1479-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), no direct enzymatic data have been reported for the product of any plant arginase gene. To begin to assess the role of arginase in arginine homeostasis in higher plants, we identified and characterized two arginase genes (LeARG1 and LeARG2) from tomato. Our results demonstrate that, despite their phylogenetic similarity to agmatinases, the proteins encoded by LeARG1 and LeARG2 have robust amidinohydrolase activity against and high specificity for l-arginine. We report that LeARG2 expression in leaves is strongly induced by wounding and, furthermore, that this induction is mediated by the plant stress signal jasmonic acid (JA). We also document induced expression of arginase in response to Pseudomonas syringae, the causal agent of bacterial speck disease. The bacterial toxin coronatine, which exerts its effects by activating the host JA signaling pathway, was both necessary and sufficient for arginase induction in P. syringae-infected plants. The potential role of stress-induced arginase in higher plants is discussed. Plant Material and Treatments—Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum cv. Castlemart) plants were grown in Jiffy peat pots (Hummert International) in a growth chamber maintained under 17 h of light (200 μE m-2 s-1) at 28 °C and 7 h of dark at 18 °C. Seed for the sterile jai1-1 mutant was obtained from a segregating population as described by Li et al. (36Li L. Li C. Howe G.A. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1414-1417Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Flowers and fruits were harvested from plants maintained in a greenhouse. For experiments involving methyl-JA (MeJA) treatment, 3-week-old plants were placed in a closed Lucite box (31 cm × 27 cm × 14 cm) and treated with 2 μl of pure MeJA (Bedoukian Research) dissolved in 300 μl of ethanol, as previously described (37Li L. Howe G.A. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 46: 409-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A hemostat was used to inflict mechanical wounds near the distal end of leaflet, perpendicular to the midvein. Zhao et al. (38Zhao Y. Thilmony R. Bender C.L. Schaller A. He S.Y. Howe G.A. Plant J. 2003; 36: 485-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) described the source of coronatine (COR) and application to tomato plants. Briefly, 20 ng of COR (dissolved in 0.1 m NH4HCO3, 5 ng/μl) was applied to the adaxial surface of leaflets of 3-week-old tomato plants. Control plants were treated with 4 μlof0.1 m NH4HCO3. The sources and growth conditions of Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato strain DC3000 (Pst DC3000) and the mutant strain Pst DC3118 COR- were described previously (38Zhao Y. Thilmony R. Bender C.L. Schaller A. He S.Y. Howe G.A. Plant J. 2003; 36: 485-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Bacterial suspensions were vacuum-infiltrated into the leaves of 3-week-old plants (38Zhao Y. Thilmony R. Bender C.L. Schaller A. He S.Y. Howe G.A. Plant J. 2003; 36: 485-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Three replicate samples were taken for each treatment over a 4-day period. At various times following the treatment, leaf tissue was harvested, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C until further use for RNA extraction or arginase assays (see below). Identification of Full-length LeARG cDNAs—A search of the tomato EST (Expressed Sequence Tag) data base (version 9.0 released on April 17, 2003) at the Institute for Genomic Research (www.tigr.org/tdb/lgi/) identified two tentative consensus sequences (TC124738 and TC124737) that were annotated as arginase. cDNA clones (EST435583 and EST337938) corresponding to representative members of these two genes were obtained from the Clemson University Genomics Institute. cDNA inserts from each clone were sequenced in their entirety on both strands. The cDNA corresponding to EST435583, which we designated LeARG1, was 1508 bp in length and included 252 bp upstream of the initiator AUG codon and 209 bp in the 3′-untranslated region (excluding 30 poly(A) residues). The presence of an in-frame stop codon (TAA) nine nucleotides upstream of the initiator AUG codon indicated that the cDNA encodes a full-length protein. The cDNA corresponding to EST337938, which we designated LeARG2, was 1360 bp in length and included 19 bp upstream of the initiator AUG codon and 266 bp in the 3′-untranslated region (excluding 58 poly(A) residues). The presence of an in-frame stop codon (TAA) 9 nucleotides upstream of the initiator AUG codon indicated that this cDNA also encodes a full-length protein. Data base searches were performed using the BLAST program (39Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69707) Google Scholar) available at the U.S. National Center for Biotechnology. Arginase Phylogeny—Members of the arginase superfamily were identified by BLAST searches against non-redundant sequence databases (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/) and TIGR plant EST databases (www.tigr.org/tdb/tgi/plant.shtml). Sequences obtained from the TIGR databases are composed of unigene clusters of multiple EST clones. A total of 85 sequences were used for construction of the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1). Sequence accession numbers are listed in Fig. S1 (Supplemental Materials). Amino acid sequences were aligned using PILEUP in the GCG software suite (Wisconsin Package version 10.2, Genetics Computer Group (GCG), Madison, WI). A neighbor-joining phylogeny was constructed from mean character distances using PAUP 4.0*, version 4.0b10 (40Swofford D.L. PAUP*. Phylogenetic Analysis Using Parsimony (*and Other Methods), Version 4. Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA2000Google Scholar). Neighbor-joining bootstrap replicates were run to test the branching order reliability. Expression and Purification of Recombinant LeARG1 and LeARG2— Basic molecular techniques were performed as described in Sambrook et al. (41Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Springer Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). A PCR-based approach was used to construct the expression vector that added a C-terminal His6 tag to the LeARG coding sequence. Forward and reverse primers were designed to contain NdeI and XhoI restriction sites, respectively. For preparation of the LeARG1 construct, the sequence of the forward primer was 5′-GGA ATT CCA TAT GAG GAG TGC TGG AAG AAT-3′ and that of the reverse primer was 5′-CCG CTC GAG CTT GGA TAT CTT GGC AGT AAG-3′. For preparation of the LeARG2 construct, the sequence of the forward primer was 5′-GGA ATT CCA TAT GAA GAG TGC TGG AAG TAT-3′ and that of the reverse primer was 5′-CCG CTC GAG CTT GGA CAT CTT GGC AGC AAG-3′. PCR amplification of EST435583 (LeARG1) and EST337938 (LeARG2) yielded a 1.0-kilobase product that was subsequently cut with NdeI and XhoI subcloned into the same sites of the expression vector pET-23b (Novagen, Madison, WI). The resulting construct placed an additional eight amino acids (LEHHHHHH) on the C terminus of the protein. His-tagged recombinant proteins were expressed in BL21(DE3) host cells as follows. An overnight culture (1 ml) was inoculated into 50 ml of Terrific Broth medium supplemented with 200 μg/ml ampicillin. Bacteria were grown at 37 °C in a shaker at 250 rpm for 4 h to a cell density of about 1.2 A600, and then isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.25 mm. The induced culture was incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. Cells were collected by centrifugation and stored at -20 °C until further use. Purification of the His-tagged LeARG1 and LeARG2 was performed at 4 °C except where otherwise noted. Bacterial cells expressing the construct were harvested from 50 ml of culture medium, followed by resuspension in 2 ml of Tris buffer (50 mm, pH 8.0) containing 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cells were first incubated with 2.5 mg of lysozyme for 60 min at room temperature and then lysed using three 2-min pulses from a probe-type sonicator (Branson Sonifier Model 450). Cell homogenates were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min. The resulting supernatant was collected, and the buffer was exchanged to binding buffer (5 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9) with a 5-ml spin column prepared with Sephadex G-25 (Amersham Biosciences) and equilibrated with binding buffer. Nickel-charged resin columns having a 1-ml bed volume (Qiagen) were conditioned with 10 ml of water and then 5 ml of binding buffer. After loading the protein solution (2 ml in binding buffer), the column was washed with 10 ml of binding buffer and 10 ml of washing buffer (80 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9). His-tagged arginase was eluted with elution buffer (400 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9) and collected in 2-ml fractions. Arginase eluted in the first two fractions as determined by analysis of fractions on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Imidazole was removed from the protein samples with a 5-ml spin column packed with Sephadex G-25 and equilibrated with 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (42Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The relative purity of recombinant protein was assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and staining of gels with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Enzyme Assays—Frozen tomato leaves (∼1.5 g) were ground in liquid nitrogen with a mortar and pestle and then homogenized in 10 ml of 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Homogenates were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were used as the enzyme source. Recombinant LeARG enzyme was prepared as described above. Protein concentrations were determined as described above. Arginase activity was measured with a spectrophotometric assay for detection of urea (43Alabadí D. Aguero M.S. Perez-Amador M.A. Carbonell J. Plant Physiol. 1996; 112: 1237-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. The enzyme solution was activated with 1 mm MnCl2 at 37 °C for 60 min. The reaction mixture (0.5 ml) contained 10 μl of the enzyme source in assay buffer (50 mm CHES buffer (pH 9.6), 250 mm l-arginine, 2 mm MnCl2). Reactions were carried out at 37 °C for 20 min and stopped by the addition of 500 μl of 15% (v/v) perchloric acid. A 200-μl aliquot was mixed vigorously with 3 ml of acid mixture (9% (v/v) of phosphoric acid and 27% (v/v) of sulfuric acid) and 100 μl of 3% (w/v) α-isonitrosopropiophenone (Sigma) in 95% ethanol. This mixture was heated in a boiling water bath in the dark for 60 min and cooled for 10 min to room temperature. The A540 was recorded on a Uvikon 933 spectrophotometer (Research Instruments, San Diego, CA). Substrate specificity tests were performed as described above with the exception that agmatine and other related compounds were added in place of l-arginine, to a final concentration of 250 mm. All substrates tested were obtained from Sigma. Three buffer systems were used to test the effect of pH on arginase activity: 200 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 7.5, 11.0, and 12.0; 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 8.0, and 8.5; and 200 mm Gly-NaOH, pH 8.7, 9.0, 9.5, 10.0, and 10.5 (Alabadí et al. (43Alabadí D. Aguero M.S. Perez-Amador M.A. Carbonell J. Plant Physiol. 1996; 112: 1237-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar)). Inhibitor studies were conducted with test compounds that were dissolved in water and then diluted into the assay buffer at various concentrations prior to addition of enzyme. For example, 1 μl of a 5-mm l-NOHA stock was added to 489 μl of assay buffer, followed by addition of 10 μl of enzyme solution. The reaction was carried out as described above. l-NOHA was obtained from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). Nucleic Acid Blot Analysis—RNA blot analyses were performed as previously described (44Howe G.A. Lee G.I. Itoh A. Li L. DeRocher A. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 711-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Full-length LeARG1 and LeARG2 cDNAs were PCR-amplified with T3 and T7 primers that anneal to the pBlueScript vector. Because full-length LeARG1 and LeARG2 cDNAs cross-hybridize to each other, a PCR-based approach was used to generate gene-specific probes corresponding to the diverged untranslated regions of the cDNA. Primers used to generate the LeARG1-specific probe were 5′-CCC CTT CAC AAG AGA AGA AAT-3′ and 5′-TTC TGA TTA TCC TAC AAC TGC-3′. The resulting 233-bp product hybridizes to the 5′-untranslated region of LeARG1 transcripts. Primers used to generate the LeARG2-specific probe were 5′-CAA GCA AGA AGT ACC ATG TAT-3′ and T7 5′-TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GG-3′ (T7 primer), which gave a 349-bp product that included 48 bp from the pBluescript SK vector. This probe hybridized specifically to the 3′-untranslated region of LeARG2 transcripts. Total RNA was extracted from various tissues of soil-grown plants. Hybridization signals on RNA blots were normalized to the signal obtained using a cDNA probe for translation initiation factor eIF4A mRNA, obtained from Clemson University (EST clone cLED1D24). Tomato genomic DNA preparations and Southern blot analysis were as described previously (44Howe G.A. Lee G.I. Itoh A. Li L. DeRocher A. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 711-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Identification of Arginase-encoding Genes in Tomato—A search of the tomato EST data base at The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR) identified two genes annotated as arginase, which we designated LeARG1 and LeARG2. Full-length LeARG1 and LeARG2 cDNAs were predicted to encode 338-amino acid proteins having calculated molecular weights of 37,048 and 36,851, respectively. The deduced amino acid sequences of LeARG1 and LeARG2 were 89% identical to each other, and 70–87% identical to arginase sequences reported from Arabidopsis (31Krumpelman P.M. Freyermuth S.K.

Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and loblolly pine (33Todd C.D. Cooke J.E. Mullen R.T. Gifford D.J. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 45: 555-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Sequence alignments between the plant arginases showed a high degree of amino acid sequence identity over almost the entire length of the polypeptide. The greatest sequence diversity between plant arginases was at the N-terminal end. This region of the plant arginase exhibits features of a mitochondrial targeting peptide (32Goldraij A. Polacco J.C. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), which is consistent with the localization of the enzyme to this organelle (22Kollöffel C. van Dijke H.D. Plant Physiol. 1975; 55: 507-510Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Goldraij A. Polacco J.C. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequence alignments between 85 amidinohydrolases from diverse organisms indicated that the arginase superfamily is divided into four major groups: (i) l-arginases from vertebrates, fungi, and bacteria (referred to here as non-plant arginases); (ii) plant arginases, including LeARG1 and LeARG2; (iii) agmatinases and agmatinase-like enzymes; and (iv) several hypothetical arginase-like proteins from archea and eubacteria (Fig. 1). All plant arginases (14 sequences from 11 species) formed a monophyletic cluster that was clearly distinguisha"
https://openalex.org/W1993729354,"We reported previously that the synthesis of specific proteins such as OppA, Cya, and RpoS (sigma(38)), which are important for cell growth and viability, is stimulated by polyamines at the level of translation. In this study we found that the synthesis of FecI and Fis was also stimulated by polyamines at the level of translation. The FecI and Fis proteins enhance the expression of mRNAs that are involved in iron uptake and energy metabolism and the expression of rRNA and some tRNAs. The Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence of their mRNAs was not obvious or was not located at the usual position. When the SD sequences were created at the normal position on these mRNAs, protein synthesis was no longer influenced by polyamines. Thus, the common characteristic of these mRNAs was to have a weak or ineffective SD sequence. We propose that a group of genes whose expression is enhanced by polyamines at the level of translation be referred to as a By DNA microarray, we found that 309 of 2,742 mRNA species were upregulated by polyamines. Among the 309 up-regulated genes, transcriptional enhancement of at least 58 genes might be attributable to increased levels of the transcription factors Cya, RpoS, FecI, and Fis, which are all organized in the polyamine modulon. This unifying molecular mechanism is proposed to underlie the physiological role of polyamines in controlling the growth of Escherichia coli."
https://openalex.org/W2026128531,"UDP-sugars, activated forms of monosaccharides, are synthesized through de novo and salvage pathways and serve as substrates for the synthesis of polysaccharides, glycolipids, and glycoproteins in higher plants. A UDP-sugar pyrophosphorylase, designated PsUSP, was purified about 1,200-fold from pea (Pisum sativum L.) sprouts by conventional chromatography. The apparent molecular mass of the purified PsUSP was 67,000 Da. The enzyme catalyzed the formation of UDP-Glc, UDP-Gal, UDP-glucuronic acid, UDP-l-arabinose, and UDP-xylose from respective monosaccharide 1-phosphates in the presence of UTP as a co-substrate, indicating that the enzyme has broad substrate specificity toward monosaccharide 1-phosphates. Maximum activity of the enzyme occurred at pH 6.5–7.5, and at 45 °C in the presence of 2 mm Mg2+. The apparent Km values for Glc 1-phosphate and l-arabinose 1-phosphate were 0.34 and 0.96 mm, respectively. PsUSP cDNA was cloned by reverse transcriptase-PCR. PsUSP appears to encode a protein with a molecular mass of 66,040 Da (600 amino acids) and possesses a uridine-binding site, which has also been found in a human UDP-N-acetylhexosamine pyrophosphorylase. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that PsUSP can be categorized in a group together with homologues from Arabidopsis and rice, which is distinct from the UDP-Glc and UDP-N-acetylhexosamine pyrophosphorylase groups. Recombinant PsUSP expressed in Escherichia coli catalyzed the formation of UDP-sugars from monosaccharide 1-phosphates and UTP with efficiency similar to that of the native enzyme. These results indicate that the enzyme is a novel type of UDP-sugar pyrophosphorylase, which catalyzes the formation of various UDP-sugars at the end of salvage pathways in higher plants.

These results indicate that the enzyme is a novel type of UDP-sugar pyrophosphorylase, which catalyzes the formation of various UDP-sugars at the end of salvage pathways in higher plants. It is highly probable that the relative amounts and the architecture of cell wall polysaccharides and of the sugar moieties of glycolipids and glycoproteins in higher plants are regulated by the level of nucleotide sugars available, as well as by the levels of glycosyltransferases that incorporate monosaccharide units from respective nucleotide sugars into the polymers. Activated nucleotide sugars that serve as glycosyl donors for these polymers in higher plants are generated through de novo pathways, in which various UDP- and GDP-sugars are produced through sequential interconversions from UDP-Glc and GDP-Man as the starting substrates (1Reiter W.D. Vanzin G.F. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 47: 95-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In the salvage pathways, alternative routes to synthesize nucleotide sugars, free monosaccharides released during the degradation of polysaccharides and glycoconjugates are first phosphorylated by the action of monosaccharide kinases, then converted into nucleotide sugars by the action of pyrophosphorylases in the presence of the respective nucleotide triphosphates as co-substrates. Pyrophosphorylases principally catalyze both the following forward (synthesis of NDP-sugars) and reverse (pyrophospholysis) reactions (1Reiter W.D. Vanzin G.F. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 47: 95-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar): monosaccharides 1-phosphates + NTP ↔ NDP-sugars + PPi, where NTP and NDP are nucleoside triphosphates and diphosphates, respectively. Various kinases and pyrophosphorylases are involved in the salvage pathways and seem to regulate carbon flux, together with enzymes in de novo pathways, leading to modification of the architecture of polysaccharides and glycoconjugates (1Reiter W.D. Vanzin G.F. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 47: 95-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Indeed, an l-arabinose-sensitive ara mutant of Arabidopsis is known to be deficient in l-arabinokinase (ARA1, EC 2.7.1.46) and cannot reutilize free l-arabinose (l-Ara) 1The abbreviations used are: l-Ara, l-arabinose; PsUSP, P. sativum UDP-sugar pyrophosphorylase; l-Fuc, l-fucose; GlcA, d-glucuronic acid; Xyl, xylose; UDP-HexNAc, UDP-N-acetylhexosamine; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; BSA, bovine serum albumin; MOPS, 3-morpholinopropanesulfonic acid; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends., 2Sugars mentioned in this article belong to the d-series unless otherwise noted. because of the block in the l-arabinose salvage pathway. Administration of exogenous l-Ara to the mutant causes severe growth inhibition, providing evidence of the importance of the salvage pathways for normal growth and development of plants (2Dolezal O. Cobbett S.C. Plant Physiol. 1991; 96: 1255-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Further evidence came from the case of the mur1 mutant of Arabidopsis with dwarf phenotype, which shows a decrease in l-fucose (l-Fuc) content in rhamnogalacturonan II because of a defect in the conversion of GDP-Man to GDP-l-Fuc in the de novo pathway (3O'Neill M.A. Eberhard S. Albersheim P. Darvill A.G. Science. 2001; 294: 846-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Since the phenotype is rescued by addition of exogenous l-Fuc to the mur1 mutant, a normal level of GDP-l-Fuc seems to be supplied by the salvage pathway via l-Fuc 1-phosphate synthesis (1Reiter W.D. Vanzin G.F. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 47: 95-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that the network of the synthesis of nucleotide sugars is regulated through concerted actions of various enzymes involved in both de novo and the salvage pathways. In cell wall polysaccharides, l-Ara and xylose (Xyl) are the predominant pentose constituents found in pectins, arabinogalactan proteins, xyloglucans, and arabinoxylans, etc. They are incorporated into these polymers from UDP-β-l-arabinopyranose (UDP-l-Ara) and UDP-α-d-xylose (UDP-Xyl) by the action of l-arabinosyltransferases and xylosyltransferases, respectively (4Doblin M.S. Vergara C.E. Read S. Newbigin E. Bacic A. Rose J.K.C. The Plant Cell Wall, Annual Plant Reviews. 8. Blackwell Publishing, Oxford2003: 183-222Google Scholar). UDP-Xyl is generated from UDP-glucuronic acid (GlcA) as the immediate substrate in the de novo pathway mediated by UDP-glucurunate decarboxylase (UDP-glucuronate carboxylyase; EC 4.1.1.35) (5Harper A.D. Bar-Peled M. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 2188-2198Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), that is then interconverted to UDP-l-Ara by the action of UDP-l-arabinose 4-epimerase (EC 5.1.3.5) (6Burget E.G. Reiter W.D. Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 383-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In the salvage pathway, UDP-l-Ara is generated by sequential conversions via l-Ara 1-phosphate catalyzed by the action of l-arabinokinase mentioned above, followed by UDP-l-Ara pyrophosphorylase (UTP: β-l-arabinose 1-phosphate uridylyltransferase, no EC number). In a similar manner, UDP-Xyl is produced by xylokinase and UDP-Xyl pyrophosphorylase (UTP: α-d-xylose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase, EC 2.7.7.11). The latter enzyme has been detected in a crude enzyme preparation from mung bean seedlings (7Ginsburg V. Neufeld F.E. Hassid Z.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1956; 42: 333-335Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but it has been neither purified nor cloned so far. Furthermore, it is unclear whether distinct pyrophosphorylases specific to either of the pentose 1-phosphates are involved in the synthesis of each UDP-pentose or whether a single pyrophosphorylase with broad specificity toward pentose 1-phosphates is responsible for both UDP-pentoses (8Feingold S.D. Avigad G. Stumpt P.K. Conn E.E. The Biochemistry of Plants. 3. Academic Press, New York1980: 101-170Google Scholar). For a better understanding of the regulation of the synthesis of the various nucleotide sugars in the salvage pathways, it is necessary to get information on individual monosaccharide kinases and pyrophosphorylases leading to the generation of particular nucleotide sugars. In this article, we report the purification, characterization, and cloning of a pyrophosphorylase involved in the synthesis of UDP-l-Ara from pea (Pisum sativum L.) sprouts. The enzyme appears to be a novel type of pyrophosphorylase generating various UDP-sugars from respective monosaccharide 1-phosphates. In this context, we also discuss the characteristics of the enzyme based on the comparison of amino acid sequences with other pyrophosphorylases as well as its possible function in vivo. Materials—Pea (P. sativum L.) sprouts were purchased from a local market and incubated under illumination in a growth chamber at 25 °C for 1 day prior to preparation of the enzyme. Pea (cv. Dun) seeds were a gift from Murakami Seed (Yokohama, Japan). For RNA preparation, pea seeds were sown on 1% agar plates and grown at 25 °C for 7 days. β-l-Arabinopyranose 1-phosphate (l-Ara 1-phosphate) and UDP-β-l-arabinopyranose (UDP-l-Ara) were chemically synthesized according to the methods of Aspinall et al. (9Aspinall G.O. Cottrell I.W. Matheson N.K. Can. J. Biochem. 1972; 50: 574-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and MacDonald (10MacDonald D.L. J. Org. Chem. 1962; 27: 1107-1109Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and the method of Roseman et al. (11Roseman S. Distler J.J. Moffatt J.G. Khorana H.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1961; 83: 659-663Crossref Scopus (160) Google Scholar), respectively. UDP-Xyl was enzymatically prepared according to the method of Kobayashi et al. (12Kobayashi M. Nakagawa H. Suda I. Miyagawa I. Matoh T. Plant Cell Physiol. 2002; 43: 1259-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Inorganic pyrophosphatase from yeast, ATP, CTP, GTP, ITP, UTP, PPi, UDP-Glc, UDP-Gal, UDP-GlcA, UDP-GlcNAc, 1-phosphates of Gal, Glc, GlcA, GlcNAc, Man, Xyl, and l-Fuc, and Glc 6-phosphate were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. V8 protease from Staphylococcus aureus was from Wako (Osaka, Japan). Protein Determination—The concentration of protein was determined by the method of Bradford with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the standard (13Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). Enzyme Assay—The activity of pea pyrophosphorylase (also called UDP-sugar pyrophosphorylase in this paper, because of its broad substrate specificity) was determined by monitoring the formation (forward direction of the enzyme action) of either UDP-Glc or UDP-l-Ara from respective Glc 1-posphate or l-Ara 1-phosphate in the presence of UTP. The reaction mixture usually contained 50 mm MOPS-KOH buffer, pH 7.0, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.01% (w/v) BSA, 1 mm monosaccharide 1-phosphate, 1mm UTP, and enzyme in a final volume of 0.1 ml (this is referred to as the standard reaction mixture). The enzyme was preincubated at 35 °C for 5 min in buffer without substrates, and then the reaction was started by addition of monosaccharide 1-phosphate and UTP. After incubation at 35 °C for 10 min, the reaction was terminated by dipping the mixture in a boiling water bath for 2 min. The reaction products were detected according to the method described by Pauly et al. (14Pauly M. Porchia A. Olsen C.E. Nunan K.J. Scheller H.V. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 278: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min, and then 40-μl aliquots were analyzed on a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system with a Shimadzu LC-10AD equipped with a CarboPac PA-1 column (4 × 250 mm, Dionex Japan). The column was eluted with 50 mm ammonium formate for the initial 2 min, followed by a linear gradient (50–650 mm, 2–26 min) and an isocratic elution with the eluent (1 m, 26–32 min) at a flow rate of 1 ml per min and at 35 °C. The reaction products were monitored by absorbance at 262 nm, and the amount of UDP-sugar produced was estimated from the peak area based on the curve of UDP-Glc as the calibration standard. One unit of enzyme activity is capable of producing 1 μmol of UDP-Glc or UDP-l-Ara from respective monosaccharide 1-phosphates per min. When various monosaccharide 1-phosphates were examined for their efficiency as substrate for the enzyme, each UDP-sugar produced was confirmed by comparison of its elution time with respective standard UDP-sugars on HPLC. Elution times of standard nucleotide sugars as well as uridine nucleotides are shown in parentheses as follows: UDP-l-Ara (14.89 min), UDP-Gal (14.99), UDP-Xyl (15.16), UDP-Glc (15.24), UDP-Glc-NAc (15.24), UDP-GlcA (24.53), UMP (14.64), UDP (18.39), UTP (23.72). When crude enzyme preparations were assayed for activity during purification of the enzyme, UMP was also detected in reaction mixtures possibly because of the presence of phosphatase(s) and/or pyrophosphatase(s) that degrade substrates and/or products. The assay for pyrophospholysis of UDP-Glc (reverse direction of the enzyme action) was performed in a 0.1-ml reaction mixture containing 50 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.0, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.01% (w/v) BSA, 1 mm UDP-Glc, 1 mm PPi, and enzyme. Here, the enzyme activity was measured in a similar manner as above with UTP as the calibration standard, and expressed as μmol of UTP produced per min. Enzyme Purification—A procedure described by Kobayashi et al. (12Kobayashi M. Nakagawa H. Suda I. Miyagawa I. Matoh T. Plant Cell Physiol. 2002; 43: 1259-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) was modified to prepare the crude enzyme fraction. All operations were carried out at 0–4 °C. Pea seedlings (1 kg) containing epicotyls and leaves were chopped with razor blades and homogenized with two times their weight in homogenization buffer containing 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.9, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA in a homogenizer. The homogenate was filtered through three layers of nylon mesh, then centrifuged at 1,500 × g for 15 min to remove cell debris. The crude enzyme fraction was further fractionated with crystalline ammonium sulfate. Proteins precipitated between 40 and 70% saturation with ammonium sulfate were collected by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 min, dissolved in 120 ml of a column buffer (20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.9, containing 0.5 mm dithiothreitol; this buffer was used throughout for all chromatography), and dialyzed overnight against the same buffer. The dialyzed sample was adsorbed onto a 2.8 × 73-cm DEAE-Sepharose FF (Amersham Biosciences) column, which had been equilibrated with the column buffer. The column was eluted with the buffer, followed by a linear gradient of 0–500 mm NaCl in the column buffer (total volume, 1.5 liters). The active fractions were collected, brought to 30% saturation with ammonium sulfate, and applied onto a 2 × 19.5-cm Butyl-Toyopearl 650 m (Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan) column equilibrated with the buffer containing 30% saturated ammonium sulfate. The column was eluted with a linear gradient of 30–0% saturated ammonium sulfate in the buffer (total volume, 700 ml). The active fractions were combined, brought to 80% saturation with crystalline ammonium sulfate, and proteins were recovered by centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 40 min. The proteins were dissolved in 2 ml of the buffer and applied onto a 2 × 112-cm Sephacryl S-200 (Amersham Biosciences) column equilibrated with the buffer containing 100 mm NaCl. The column was eluted with the same buffer, and the active fractions were collected and dialyzed overnight against the buffer. The dialyzed sample was then applied onto a 0.7 × 12-cm DEAE-Sepharose FF column equilibrated with the column buffer. The column was eluted with a linear gradient of 0–300 mm NaCl in the buffer (total volume, 200 ml), and the active fractions were collected. The enzyme specimen was stored at 4 °C and used in the following experiments. Peptide Sequencing—The purified enzyme (10 μg) was digested with 3 μg of V8 protease from Saccharomyces aureus at 25 °C for 15 min. The peptide fragments were separated on SDS-PAGE (15Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar), blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride-Plusmembrane (Osmonics, Moers, Germany) and subjected to an N-terminal amino acid analysis with a protein sequencer HP G1000A (Hewlett Packard). cDNA Cloning—Total RNA was extracted from 7-day-old pea seedlings containing epicotyls, leaves and roots. The seedlings were frozen in liquid nitrogen, homogenized with mortar and pestle, and extracted with an Isogen kit (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Single strand cDNA was synthesized from 2 μg of total RNA from the pea seedlings using a reverse-transcriptase, ReverTra Ace-α-(Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) and an oligo(dT)-adaptor primer (5′-GCGACATCATCGAATTCCGATGTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT-3′). For cloning of the UDP-sugar pyrophosphorylase gene, two degenerate primers, F-1 (5′-CAYGGNCAYGGNGARGT-3′) and R-1 (5′-GGRTARTCYTGCATCATRCAYTC-3′), were designed based on the conserved regions (HGHGDV and ECMMQDYP, respectively) found in common with Arabidopsis At5g52560 and rice AK064009. The PCR was performed with the degenerate primers, F-1 and R-1, using the single strand cDNA as a template under the following conditions: 0.5 min denaturing at 94 °C, 0.5 min annealing at 45 °C and 1.5 min amplification at 72 °C, 35 cycles. The amplified cDNA fragment was subcloned into a pGEM T-Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI), and the nucleotide sequence was determined with an ABI PRISM 310 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The 3′-region was amplified with an internal specific primer (5′-GGCTCACCCACTCTGATGGG-3′, corresponding to RLTHSDG of the cloned sequence) and an adaptor primer (5′-GCGACATCATCGAATTCCGATG-3′), using the single strand cDNA as a template under the following conditions: 0.5 min denaturing at 94 °C, 0.5 min annealing at 55 °C and 2.0 min amplification at 72 °C, 30 cycles. The 5′-region of the gene was cloned with a kit for rapid amplification of 5′ cDNA ends (5′-RACE kit, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) using internal specific primers (5′-CCATACTTTCAGAATACCGC-3′ and 5′-AGAACCCATTTCAACCCGGC-3′, corresponding to SGILKVW and AGLKWVL of the cloned sequence, respectively). The coding region was amplified with proofreading polymerase (KOD-plus-, Toyobo), and the nucleotide sequence was determined. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Enzyme—The coding region of the cloned cDNA of UDP-sugar pyrophosphorylase was amplified with a set of specific primers, S-1 (5′-GGATCCATGGCTTCCTCCCTCGG-3′) and A-1 (5′-GAGCTCTATATTCTTTGCGCAC-3′), which contain restriction sites for BamHI and SacI, respectively. The cDNA fragment was subcloned into a pGEM5zf+ vector (Promega), and its nucleotide sequence was confirmed, then inserted between the BamHI and SacI sites of the pET32a expression vector (Novagen, Madison, WI). The construct was designed to express the recombinant enzyme fused to thioredoxin and His6-tags at the N terminus. The plasmid construct was transfected into a BL21 gold strain of Escherichia coli (Novagen). The E. coli cells were grown at 10 °C, and the recombinant protein was induced by treatment with 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 24 h. The E. coli cells were harvested and lysed in a buffer containing 25 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.2% lysozyme from chicken egg (Wako). The lysate was put on a 1.5 × 6.0-cm chelating Sepharose FF column. The column was washed with 50 mm sodium-phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 50 mm imidazole, and the bound protein was then eluted with the same buffer containing 250 mm imidazole. Approximately 5 mg of purified recombinant UDP-sugar pyrophosphorylase was obtained from a 500-ml culture of E. coli. The purified recombinant enzyme (1 mg) was digested with 0.1 unit of thrombin (Novagen) at 20 °C for 24 h in order to split off the fused thioredoxin and His6 tags, then dialyzed overnight against the column buffer mentioned under “Enzyme Purification.” The dialyzed sample was applied onto a 1.5 × 1.0-cm DEAE-Sepharose FF column equilibrated with the buffer. The column was eluted with a linear gradient of 0–300 mm NaCl in the buffer (total volume, 50 ml) and the active fractions were collected. The purified recombinant enzyme was examined for its purity, specific activity, and substrate specificity. Analyses of Product—To identify UDP-sugar formed by the action of the recombinant enzyme, a large scale reaction was employed. A reaction mixture consisting of 50 mm MOPS-KOH buffer, pH 7.0, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mml-Ara 1-phosphate, 1 mm UTP, 0.1 unit/ml inorganic pyrophosphatase from yeast, and 0.4 unit/ml recombinant enzyme in a final volume of 50 ml was incubated at 35 °C for 24 h: the rate of conversion to UDP-l-Ara was 84% based on the initial l-Ara 1-phosphate according to analysis on HPLC done as described above. After the reaction was terminated by heating in a boiling water bath, the mixture was passed through a 4.8 × 10-cm charcoal column (Wako). After washing the column with water, the adsorbed UDP-sugar was eluted with 70% (v/v) ethanol containing 0.1 m ammonium hydroxide, and monitored for total sugar (16Dubois M. Gilles K.A. Hamilton J.K. Rebers P.A. Smith F. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 350-356Crossref Scopus (40882) Google Scholar) and absorbance at 260 nm. Aliquots of the eluate were also analyzed on HPLC to detect UDP-l-Ara. To obtain pure specimens, the pooled fraction was concentrated and then subjected to preparative paper chromatography using Whatman 3MM filter paper with 7:4:2 (v/v/v) 1-butanol/ethanol/water as the solvent (to wash out salts from the mixture), followed by 5:2 (v/v) ethanol/1 M ammonium acetate, pH 6.8 (to migrate and separate UDP-l-Ara from other reaction components). A strip of paper corresponding to UDP-l-Ara was cut and developed again with the first solvent. A pure UDP-l-Ara specimen was extracted from the paper and lyophilized (yield, 8 mg). Identification of the isolated UDP-l-Ara was performed by NMR spectroscopy. The sample was dissolved in D2O and NMR spectra were recorded at room temperature. 1H-, 13C-, and 31P-NMR spectra were recorded at 600, 150, and 243 MHz, respectively, with a JEOL JNM-ECA 600 spectrometer. Dioxane was used as the reference for 1H-NMR (δ = 3.75 ppm) and 13C-NMR (δ = 67.4 ppm), and 85% H3PO4 was used as an external reference for 31P-NMR (δ = 0.0 ppm). PFG-COSY, PFG-HMQC, and PFG-HMBC were recorded for assignment of signals. Purification of a Pyrophosphorylase from Pea Sprouts—We looked for activity of UDP-l-Ara pyrophosphorylase in plant sources and found the activity, together with UDP-Glc pyrophosphorylase activity, in a crude enzyme preparation of pea sprouts. The enzyme was purified from the crude preparation by ammonium sulfate fractionation and several subsequent chromatographic operations: during purification, both enzyme activities were monitored after each chromatographic step. Upon chromatography on a DEAE-Sepharose FF column, two partially separated UDP-Glc pyrophosphorylase activities were detected (Fig. 1A). The former peak eluted with 90 mm NaCl exhibited lower UDP-Glc pyrophosphorylase activity than the latter, and the elution profile of the former peak coincided with that of UDP-l-Ara pyrophosphorylase. The former peak was collected and subjected to further purification of the enzyme by successive chromatography on columns of Butyl Toyopearl, Sephacryl S-200, and a second DEAE-Sepharose FF chromatography monitoring elution profiles only of UDP-Glc pyrophosphorylase activity (Fig. 1, B–D). During this chromatography, a single UDP-Glc pyrophosphorylase activity peak was observed, which was accompanied by UDP-l-Ara pyrophosphorylase activity (Table I). At the final purification stage, the enzyme was purified ∼1,200-fold (based on the specific UDP-l-Ara pyrophosphorylase activity) in a yield of 0.4% (Table I). The purified enzyme (designated UDP-sugar pyrophosphorylase) appeared as a single band with an apparent molecular mass of ∼67,000 Da on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2).Table IPurification of UDP-sugar pyrophosphorylase from pea sproutsTotal proteinTotal activitySpecific activityPurificationYieldmgunitsunits/mg protein-fold%Crude extractsaExtracts prepared from 1 kg of pea sprouts.57901220(144)0.211(0.025)1.0(1.0)100.0(100.0)40-70% Ammonium sulfate1150218(80.8)0.190(0.070)0.9(2.8)17.9(56.1)1st DEAE-Sepharose FF57.7137(57.3)2.37(0.99)11.2(39.6)11.2(39.8)Butyl-Toyopearl1.4552.2(15.7)36.0(10.8)171(432)4.3(10.9)Sephacryl S-2000.1664.26(1.57)25.7(9.46)122(378)0.35(1.09)2nd DEAE-Sepharose FF0.0181.15(0.54)63.9(30.0)303(1200)0.09(0.37)a Extracts prepared from 1 kg of pea sprouts.

When the purified enzyme was incubated with Glc 1-phosphate and UTP, production of UDP-Glc increased proportionally with incubation times and the amount of enzyme protein in reaction mixtures and there was a concomitant decrease in the content of UTP on HPLC analysis. The activity, however, ceased after prolonged incubation times (see Fig. 4) or with higher amounts of protein because of the reversible character of pyrophosphorylases. This was also the case for pyrophospholysis using UDP-Glc and PPi as the substrates. Similar results were observed when Glc 1-phosphate was replaced by l-Ara 1-phosphate as the substrate. The enzyme showed an absolute requirement of divalent cations for activity (Table II) and gave maximal activity in the presence of Mg2+ or Mn2+ to produce UDP-Glc from Glc 1-phosphate and UTP as do UDP-Glc pyrophosphorylases from human, Acanthamoeba castellanii, and potato (17Tuboi K.K.

The effect of various concentrations (1–10 mm) of Mg2+ on enzyme activity was measured, and activity was found to be almost constant in the range from 1–5 mm. Activity gradually declined at higher concentrations. The maximum activity of the enzyme to form UDP-Glc was observed at pH 6.5–7.5 (Fig. 3A). The enzyme was stable in the pH range from 6.5–8.0 and lost 80% of its activity below pH 5.0.

In this study, we identify a novel DnaA-associating protein, DiaA, that is required for the timely initiation of replication during the cell cycle. DiaA promotes the growth of specific temperature-sensitive dnaA mutants and ensures stable minichromosome maintenance, whereas DiaA does not decrease the cellular DnaA content. A diaA::Tn5 mutation suppresses the cold-sensitive growth of an overinitiation type dnaA mutant independently of SeqA, a negative modulator of initiation. Flow cytometry analyses revealed that the timing of replication initiation is disrupted in the diaA mutant cells as well as wild-type cells with pBR322 expressing the diaA gene. Gel filtration and chemical cross-linking experiments showed that purified DiaA forms a stable homodimer. Immunoblotting analysis indicated that a single cell contains about 280 DiaA dimers. DiaA stimulates minichromosome replication in an in vitro system especially when the level of DnaA included is limited. Moreover, specific and direct binding between DnaA and DiaA was observed, which requires a DnaA N-terminal region. DiaA binds to both ATP- and ADP-bound forms of DnaA with a similar affinity. Thus, we conclude that DiaA is a novel DnaA-associating factor that is crucial to ensure the timely initiation of chromosomal replication.

Thus, we conclude that DiaA is a novel DnaA-associating factor that is crucial to ensure the timely initiation of chromosomal replication. In Escherichia coli, the timing of initiation of chromosomal replication during the cell cycle is strictly regulated (1Helmstetter C. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 1627-1639Google Scholar). Only a few protein factors related to this regulation have been identified to date. The DnaA protein is the initiator of replication, and its nucleotide-bound forms change in coordination with the replication cycle (2Boye E. Løbner-Olesen A. Skarstad K. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 3Katayama T. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 4Messer W. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2002; 26: 355-374PubMed Google Scholar). The cellular content of ATP-bound DnaA increases temporarily around the time of replication initiation (5Kurokawa K. Nishida S. Emoto A. Sekimizu K. Katayama T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6642-6652Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). DnaA in its active ATP-bound form unwinds duplex in the initiation complex, which includes the origin (oriC) and DnaA multimers, so that DnaB helicase, DnaG primase, and DNA polymerase III holoenzyme can assemble replisomes on single-stranded DNA (4Messer W. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2002; 26: 355-374PubMed Google Scholar, 6Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Company, NY1992Google Scholar). The level of DnaA-ATP decreases in a DNA replication-dependent manner due to hydrolysis of DnaA-bound ATP. The resultant ADP-DnaA is inactive. The DNA-loaded sliding clamp subunit of DNA polymerase III holoenzyme and Hda protein functionally interact with ATP-DnaA to induce hydrolysis (7Katayama T. Kubota T. Kurokawa K. Crooke E. Sekimizu K. Cell. 1998; 94: 61-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 8Kato J. Katayama T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4253-4262Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). This system for regulatory inactivation of DnaA is designated “RIDA 1The abbreviations used are: RIDA, regulatory inactivation of DnaA; ORF, open reading frame; DAD, DnaA domain.” and limits initiation to once per oriC per cell cycle. In dnaA mutant cells, the timing of initiation at oriC is disrupted during the cell cycle, even under conditions that allow the cells to grow (9Skarstad K. Boye E. Steen H.B. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1711-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 10Skarstad K. von Meyenburg K. Hansen F.G. Boye E. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 852-858Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This finding indicates that timely initiation requires strict regulation of DnaA activity In E. coli, when the growth rate of cells is above a certain level, the next round of replication is initiated while the present round is still ongoing (1Helmstetter C. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 1627-1639Google Scholar). These cells contain two or four copies, or four or eight copies of oriC, depending on the growth conditions. In wild-type cells, the initiation steps at multiple oriC sites are synchronized (9Skarstad K. Boye E. Steen H.B. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1711-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). In seqA mutant cells, this synchrony is disturbed, resulting in odd numbers of oriC copies in a cell (11Lu M. Campbell J.L. Boye E. Kleckner N. Cell. 1994; 77: 413-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). The dam gene product, Dam, methylates the adenine residue in the palindromic sequence GATC that is repeated 11 times within the minimal oriC region (12Zyskind J.W. Smith D.W. Cell. 1986; 46: 489-490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). SeqA preferentially binds to these hemimethylated GATC sequences, which inhibits re-initiation at oriC (11Lu M. Campbell J.L. Boye E. Kleckner N. Cell. 1994; 77: 413-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 13Slater S. Wold S. Lu M. Boye E. Skarstad K. Kleckner N.

Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 873-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Semi-conservative replication of fully methylated oriC DNA yields hemimethylated oriC, which is sustained for a while by SeqA until Dam re-methylates these sites. Lack of SeqA accelerates the timing of re-methylation of oriC (11Lu M. Campbell J.L. Boye E. Kleckner N. Cell. 1994; 77: 413-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Asynchronous initiation is also observed in dam mutants (17Boye E. Løbner-Olesen A. Cell. 1990; 62: 981-989Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Moreover, cells expressing mutants of dnaC and Histone-like proteins, HU, IHF, and FIS, display an asynchronous replication phenotype during exponential growth (18Boye E. Løbner-Olesen A. Skarstad K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 951: 359-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 19Boye E. Lyngstadaas A. Løbner-Olesen A. Skarstad K. Wold S. Fanning E. DNA Replication and the Cell Cycle.

Leonard A.C. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 113-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). These histone-like proteins may participate in initiation complex formation at oriC (21Ryan V.T. Grimwade J.E. Nievera C.J. Leonard A.C. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 113-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 22Cassler M.R. Grimwade J.E. Leonard A.C.

As specified above, strict regulation of oriC and DnaA functions is necessary to ensure precise initiation timing. In this study, we isolated a suppressor gene from an overinitiation-type dnaA mutant, dnaAcos (24Kellenberger-Gujer G. Podhajska A.J. Caro L. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1978; 162: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 25Katayama T. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12698-12703Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Katayama T.

Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 731-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Our data show that this previously uncharacterized gene is required to ensure the timely initiation of chromosomal replication. A mutant bearing an inactive form of this gene displays an asynchronous replication phenotype. Moreover, the encoded protein directly and specifically binds DnaA. We designate this novel gene diaA, representing “DnaA initiator-associating factor.” Strains, Plasmids, Media, and Buffer—E. coli K-12 strains used for genetic experiments are described in Table I. The recA::Tn10 mutation was introduced via P1 transduction. Transductants of recipient strains bearing wild-type diaA and diaA::Tn5 mutations were obtained with similar efficiency. The recA mutation was confirmed by measuring its sensitivity to UV. pKP1673, a gift from Dr. Takeyoshi Miki, is a low copy mini-R vector containing genes for active partition and chloramphenicol resistance (30Miki T. Park J.A. Nagao K. Murayama N. Horiuchi T. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 39-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). For plasmid complementation experiments, a 3.3-kb HpaI fragment bearing the diaA gene (yraO) was isolated from a Kohara λ phage #518 (31Kohara Y. Akiyama K. Isono K. Cell. 1987; 50: 495-508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar) and inserted into the StuI site of pKP1673, resulting in pNA095. A 1.2-kb HpaI-BssHII fragment containing the entire diaA gene was similarly isolated, the BssHII end was filled in, and the resultant fragment was inserted to the StuI site of pKP1673, generating pNA102. The diaA gene within pNA102 was digested with MluI, filled in, and self-ligated to produce pNA121. The 1.2-kb HpaI-BssHII fragment was similarly filled in and inserted into the HincII site of pUC19. From the resultant plasmid (pNA159), a 1.2-kb EcoRI-PstI fragment containing diaA was isolated and inserted into the corresponding restriction sites of pT7-5, generating pKA251. For protein purification, BL21(DE3) cells containing pKA251 were used for the overproduction of DiaA. The filled-in 1.2-kb HpaI-BssHII fragment was additionally inserted into the EcoRV site of pBR322 and designated pNA135. pTOA5 (2.7 kb) and pTOA24 (6.1 kb) minichromosomes bearing oriC-mioC and gidA-oriC-mioC regions, respectively, in addition to the β-lactamase gene, were kindly provided by Dr. Tohru Ogawa (32Kano Y.

Briefly, defective λ phage containing Tn5 (λ467) was introduced into NA001 (dnaAcos) at 42 °C, and Tn5 was transposed onto the chromosome. After the strain was cured of λ phage, kanamycin-resistant colonies were isolated and purified at 30 °C. Tn5 in isolated suppressor mutants was transduced back into NA001 using P1 phage for confirmation of growth at 30 °C. One of the resultant transductants was designated NA026. The BamHI fragment of NA026 chromosomal DNA, which includes part of Tn5 encoding the kanamycin-resistant gene and the border region between Tn5 and the chromosome, was cloned into pUC18. The border region was sequenced, as described previously (26Katayama T. Akimitsu T. Mizushima T. Miki T. Sekimizu K. Mol.

Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12698-12703Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that polyclonal rabbit anti-DiaA antiserum and NA141 (diaA::Tn5) were used. Briefly, cells were grown exponentially at 37 °C in LB medium. At an optical density (A595) of 0.8, 1-ml aliquots were withdrawn, and 5% trichloroacetic acid immediately added. Precipitates formed on ice were collected by brief centrifugation and used for SDS-polyacrylamide (12%) gel electrophoresis. Separated proteins were blotted onto Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore) and detected using polyclonal rabbit anti-DiaA antiserum and alkaline phosphate-conjugated anti-rabbit antiserum (Bio-Rad).

Incubation was further continued in the presence of rifampicin (150 μg/ml) and cephalexin (10 μg/ml) for 4 h at the same temperature. Cells were collected by brief centrifugation and suspended in cold 70% ethanol. After washing and suspension of cells in cold buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 20 mm magnesium sulfate, chromosomal DNA was stained with mithramycin (27 μg/ml) and ethidium bromide (5 μg/ml). Cells were analyzed with a BRYTE-HS flow cytometer (Bio-Rad). dnaA46 cells incubated at 42 °C and containing one or two chromosomes per cell were used to calibrate the chromosome number.

Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactosidase (1 mm) was added at an optical density (A660) of 0.8, and incubation continued for 4 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4 °C, resuspended to an optical density (A595) of 200 in cold buffer containing 25 mm Hepes-KOH (pH7.6), 1 mm EDTA, and 2 mm dithiothreitol, and frozen in liquid nitrogen for storage at –80 °C. Frozen cells were thawed at 4–8 °C, incubated on ice for 30 min in the presence of 100 mm KCl and 300 μg/ml lysozyme, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. All the procedures described below were performed at 0–6 °C. Frozen cell paste was thawed, and supernatant fractions obtained by centrifugation in a Beckman type 50.2 Ti rotor at 40,000 rpm for 20 min. Proteins in the supernatant (fraction I, 21.5 ml) were precipitated with 0.22 g/ml ammonium sulfate, collected by centrifugation, and resuspended in chilled buffer C (fraction II, 1.5 ml). The solution was dialyzed against buffer C and diluted in the same buffer to 2 mg protein/ml. Supernatant (44 ml) was obtained by centrifugation, and a 40-ml aliquot was loaded onto a hydroxylapatite column (18 ml) equilibrated with buffer C at a flow rate of 18 ml/h. The column was washed with three volumes of buffer C, three volumes of buffer C containing 1 m KCl, and two volumes of buffer C containing 1 mm potassium phosphate. Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient (180 ml) from 1 to 300 mm potassium phosphate in buffer C. DiaA was detected in fractions containing 10–20 mm potassium phosphate (fraction III, 10 ml). Next, fraction III was dialyzed against buffer C containing 50 mm KCl and loaded onto a Mono Q column (bed volume of 1 ml, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with the same buffer at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. The column was washed with three volumes of buffer C containing 50 mm KCl, followed by five volumes of buffer C containing 200 mm KCl. Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient (10 ml) from 200 to 600 mm KCl in buffer C. DiaA protein was eluted at around 350 mm KCl (fraction IV, 1.6 ml). Chemical Cross-linking of DiaA—DiaA (5 μg) was incubated at room temperature for 3 h in buffer (25 μl) containing 40 mm Hepes-KOH (pH7.6), 40 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20% sucrose, and the indicated amounts of glutaraldehyde. Protein was precipitated by incubation on ice in the presence of 10% trichloroacetic acid. Precipitates were collected, dissolved in 40 μl of standard SDS sample buffer, and incubated at 100 °C for 5 min. Aliquots (10 μl) were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide (12%) gel electrophoresis, and proteins were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Gel Filtration of DiaA Protein—DiaA protein (200 μl of fraction IV, 3.1 mg/ml) was loaded on a Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer C containing 150 mm KCl at 4–6 °C at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. Using the same buffer and flow rate, DiaA was eluted. The elution profile was monitored by absorbance at 280 nm. In Vitro Minichromosome Replication and RIDA Assay—A replicative crude extract was prepared from WM433 (dnaA204) and TK24 (WM433 diaA::Tn5), using the method described previously (7Katayama T.

Using the indicated amounts of extracts and DnaA protein, M13oriCE10 minichromosome RFI (200 ng; 600 pmol as nucleotide) was incubated in reaction (25 μl), as described previously (25Katayama T. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12698-12703Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Fuller R.S. Kaguni J.M. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The RIDA reaction was promoted as above, except that [α-32P]dTTP was excluded and [α-32P]ATP-DnaA was added (7Katayama T. Kubota T. Kurokawa K. Crooke E. Sekimizu K. Cell. 1998; 94: 61-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 8Kato J. Katayama T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4253-4262Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 35Katayama T.

Nucleotide-bound forms of DnaA were assessed by immunoprecipitation and thinlayer chromatography, in accordance with earlier reports (7Katayama T. Kubota T. Kurokawa K. Crooke E. Sekimizu K. Cell. 1998; 94: 61-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 8Kato J. Katayama T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4253-4262Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Assays for Specific Binding of DiaA to DNA-bound DnaA—Gel filtration experiments were performed as follows: DnaA protein (11.5 pmol) and pBSoriC (0.43 pmol) were incubated for 5 min at 30 °C in buffer C (25 μl) containing 50 mm KCl. Fraction II (1 μg) prepared from DiaA-overproducing cells was added. After further incubation for 5 min at 30 °C, the reaction was loaded onto a Microspin S-400HR spin column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with the same buffer, and the void fraction was obtained by centrifugation (3000 rpm, 2 min) at room temperature. Control experiments in which DnaA, pBSoriC, or DiaA were excluded from the reaction, were additionally performed. Eluted proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide (12%) gel electrophoresis and silver staining. Similar results were obtained in the presence of 150 mm KCl. A pull-down assay using a biotin-conjugated polynucleotide was performed as we described previously (36Obita T. Iwura T. Su'etsugu M. Yoshida Y. Tanaka Y. Katayama T. Ueda T. Imoto T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 299: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), except that DiaA was included in the binding reaction. Briefly, the polynucleotide used was doublestrand DNA (29-mer) containing DnaA box R1 with a 5′-biotin-conjugated 30-mer T-stretch tag. DnaA protein (10 pmol) and biotin-tagged DnaA box DNA (5 pmol) were incubated for 5 min on ice in buffer C′ containing 100 mm KCl (50 μl). DiaA protein (2.4 pmol of dimer or the indicated amounts) was added, and incubation continued for 5 min on ice. Streptavidin-coated magnetic beads in suspension (50 μl; Promega) were washed twice in buffer C′ and resuspended in an equal volume of buffer C′ containing 100 mm KCl and bovine serum albumin (100 μg/ml), then added to the reaction mixture, and incubation continued for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle rotation. Streptavidin-coated beads and bound materials were collected using magnetic force, washed in buffer C′ containing 100 mm KCl and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and suspended in standard SDS sample buffer (20 μl). Beads were excluded as above, and proteins were analyzed using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The buffer for washing included the same nucleotide at a concentration of 1 μm when nucleotide-bound DnaA was used. When a cleared soluble extract (fraction I) prepared from WM433 was used instead of DiaA, the above method was applied, except for the addition of buffer C″ containing 150 mm KCl (instead of buffer C′ containing 100 mm KCl). Briefly, DnaA protein (20 pmol) and biotin-tagged DnaA box DNA (20 pmol) were incubated for 5 min on ice in buffer C″ (200 μl) containing 150 mm KCl. DnaA bound to DNA was isolated using streptavidin beads as above, suspended in buffer C″ (160 μl) containing 400 μg of WM433 fraction I and 40 mm KCl, and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle rotation. Beads bearing bound materials were collected, washed in 160 μl of buffer C″ containing 150 mm KCl and bovine serum albumin (100 μg/ml), and suspended in SDS sample buffer (80 μl). Aliquots (20 and 50 μl) of this sample were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as above and immunoblotted using anti-DiaA antiserum, respectively. The WM433 fraction I was obtained with the method of Fuller et al. (28Fuller R.S. Kaguni J.M. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 7370-7374Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), except that buffer C″ containing 250 mm KCl, 20 mm spermidine-HCl, and 300 μg/ml lysozyme was employed for cell lysis. Construction of Overproducing Plasmids of Biotin-tagged DnaA Proteins—The full-length DnaA-coding region (1.4 kb) was amplified by PCR from pKA234 (29Kubota T. Katayama T. Ito Y. Mizushima T. Sekimizu K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 130-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) using primers, 5′-GCGGATCCGTGTCACTTTCGCTTTG (TAKU5) and 5′-GCGGTACCCTTACGATGACAATGTTCTG (TAKU6). The resultant fragment was ligated to pAN6 vector (Avidity) using the BamHI and KpnI sites, resulting in pTKM12. A 1.5-kb region was amplified by PCR from pTKM12 using primers, 5′-CTAGTCTAGATTTAAGAAGGAGATATACATATGTCCGGCCTGAACGAC (KWdN5XSA) and 5′-CTTCTCTCATCCGCCAAAACAG (sim16). The resultant fragment was ligated to pBAD18 using the XbaI and HindIII sites, resulting in pST11-2, which was an overproducer of the DnaA conjugated with the biotin ligase recognition peptide (bioDnaA). A 0.45-kb region was amplified by PCR from pST11-2 using primers, KWdN5XSA, and 5′-CGGAATTCTTAACGATAGGTCGGTTCTGCC (TAKU12). The resultant fragment was digested with XbaI and ligated to pBAD18 using the NheI and SmaI sites, resulting in pTKM13, which was an overproducer of the DnaA domains I–II conjugated with the biotin ligase recognition peptide (bioDAD I–II). A 5.6-kb region was amplified by PCR from pST11-2 using primers, 5′-GGATCCTCGAGCTCCCGGCG (TAKU68) and 5′-TCTAACGTAAACGTCAAACACACG (TAKU69). The resultant fragment was self-ligated, resulting in pTKM14, which was an overproducer of the DnaA domains III–IV conjugated with the biotin ligase recognition peptide (bioDAD III-IV). All constructions were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. Overproduction and Purification of Biotin-tagged DnaA Proteins— MC1061 cells bearing pBirA (Avidity) and pST11-2 were grown at 37 °C in 2.4 liter of LB medium containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (20 μg/ml). When an optical density (A660) of the culture reached 0.4–0.6, 1% l(+)-arabinose, 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactosidase, and 50 μm (+)-biotin were included and incubation was further continued for 3 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in buffer C″ as described previously for purification of DnaA (37Sekimizu K. Yung B.Y.-M. Kornberg A. J. Biol.

The regions that undergo conformational change and form part of the transmembrane pore are currently being defined. It was shown recently that the N-terminal region (residues 10–28) of equinatoxin, an actinoporin from Actinia equina, participates in building of the final pore wall. Assuming that the pore is formed solely by a polypeptide chain, other parts of the toxin should constitute the conductive channel and here we searched for these regions by disulfide scanning mutagenesis. Only double cysteine mutants where the N-terminal segment 1–30 was attached to the β-sandwich exhibited reduced hemolytic activity upon disulfide formation, showing that other parts of equinatoxin, particularly the β-sandwich and importantly the C-terminal α-helix, do not undergo large conformational rearrangements during the pore formation. The role of the β-sandwich stability was independently assessed via destabilization of a part of its hydrophobic core by mutations of the buried Trp117. These mutants were considerably less stable than the wild-type but exhibited similar or slightly lower permeabilizing activity. Collectively these results show that a flexible N-terminal region and stable β-sandwich are pre-requisite for proper pore formation by the actinoporin family.

Interaction of proteins with lipid membranes is fundamental for many biological processes. Proteins have to bind transiently or permanently to the membranes to elicit biological functions crucial for cells (1Goñi F.M. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2002; 19: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Many examples of protein-membrane interactions are known, most notably those involved in cell signaling events (2Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32407-32410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 3Hurley J.H. Misra S. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol.

Cell. 1996; 85: 621-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a large number of protein toxins attach to membranes as the first step in creating transmembrane pores that are permeable for various compounds (5Gouaux E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 566-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The lipid membrane is the first obstacle that needs to be overcome by toxins and in fact creation of transmembrane pores is a very efficient way of killing cells. Pore-forming toxins (PFTs) 1The abbreviations used are: PFT, pore-forming toxin; ANS, 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid; BRBC, bovine red blood cells; CD, circular dichroism; DTT, dithiothreitol; EqtII, equinatoxin II; PC, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine; POC, phosphorylcholine; SM, sphingomyelin; StII, sticholysin II; mN, millinewton(s). are thus a very important group of natural toxins (6Menestrina G. Dalla Serra M. Lazarovici P. Pore-forming Peptides and Protein Toxins. Taylor & Francis, London2003Google Scholar), and the best studied examples are bacterial PFTs, because they are also important virulence factors in human and animal bacterial disease. In recent years they have been used to study fundamental biological processes such as protein-membrane and protein-protein interactions within the lipid membrane milieu and conformational changes associated with the change of environment from polar to hydrophobic as encountered within the core of lipid membranes. In general all PFTs intoxicate cells by a multistep mechanism that involves binding to the membrane, oligomerization, and transfer of a region of polypeptide across the lipid bilayer to form a functional pore (5Gouaux E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 566-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Heterogeneous PFTs can be divided into two groups according to the structural element present in the final pore. So-called β-PFTs form pores by creation of transmembrane β-barrels. Examples include α-toxin from Staphylococcus aureus, cholesterol-dependent cytolysins and anthrax protective antigen (7Heuck A.P. Tweten R.K. Johnson A.E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9065-9073Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In contrast, α-PFTs, like colicins from Escherichia coli, form pores by bundles of α-helices (8Lakey J.H. Slatin S.L. Van Der Goot F.G. Pore-Forming Toxins. 257. Springer Verlag, Heidelberg, Germany2001: 131-161Google Scholar). Although pores of β-PFTs are stable structures that resist heat or detergents, α-PFT pores are not stable and have provided little structural information. Actinoporins are a group of eukaryotic PFTs that are very important in our understanding of how α-PFTs function (9Anderluh G. Maček P. Structure. 2003; 11: 1312-1313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 10Anderluh G. Maček P. Toxicon. 2002; 40: 111-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). These 20-kDa, mainly basic, proteins can efficiently lyse various cells and permeabilize model lipid membranes by using an α-helix in a mechanism that is slowly being defined in vitro (11Athanasiadis A.

Actinoporins represent a unique family of cysteineless proteins with high sequence similarity (10Anderluh G. Maček P. Toxicon. 2002; 40: 111-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). The two most studied examples are equinatoxin II (EqtII) from the sea anemone Actinia equina and sticholysin II (StII) from Stichodactyla helianthus. They are both globular proteins composed of a tightly folded β-sandwich flanked on two sides by α-helices (Fig. 1, A and B) (11Athanasiadis A. Anderluh G. Maček P. Turk D.

The N-terminal segment containing an amphipathic α-helix (helix A) is the only part of the molecule that can be displaced without disrupting the β-sandwich fold. Actinoporins strictly follow the multistep scheme of pore formation. The initial attachment to the membrane is achieved by a cluster of aromatic amino acid residues from one of the broad loops at the bottom of the β-sandwich and helix B (13Hong Q.

In the next step the segment 10–28 is transferred to the lipid-water interface (13Hong Q. Gutiérrez-Aguirre I. Barlič A. Malovrh P. Kristan K. Podlesek Z. Maček P. Turk D. González-Mañas J.M.

The final oligomeric pore of actinoporins has not yet been directly visualized. Instead, the number of monomers was deduced only from the cross-linking studies and kinetic experiments. Both, EqtII and StII, form 2-nm pores in diameter composed of four monomers (21Belmonte G. Pederzolli C. Maček P. Menestrina G. J. Membrane Biol. 1993; 131: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 22Tejuca M. Dalla Serra M. Ferreras M. Lanio M.E. Menestrina G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14947-14957Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 23Tejuca M. Dalla Serra M. Potrich C. Alvarez C. Menestrina G. J. Membr.

Biochem. 1998; 252: 284-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Pores of such a diameter cannot be simply formed by a cluster of four helices (Fig. 1D). Either other parts of the molecule contribute to the final oligomeric conductive pore, or the pore is composed partially of lipid molecules from the bilayer. The first possibility requires considerable unfolding of the β-sandwich and its rearrangements in such a way that remaining space between helices is filled with the polypeptide chain. A testable model has been proposed for EqtII involving the formation of a transmembrane β-barrel (12Hinds M.G. Zhang W. Anderluh G. Hansen P.E. Norton R.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 1219-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Each molecule would then contribute one β-hairpin, including residues 118–142. This model requires a significant unfolding of the β sandwich, because each hairpin would include β-strands 8 and 9 and C-terminal helix B. The aim of this study is to test such models by clearly defining those regions of the EqtII molecule that undergo conformational rearrangements during the pore formation and which could therefore participate in the building of pore walls. We used disulfide scanning mutagenesis, because this technique was previously successfully used to determine conformationally flexible regions in PFTs (25Duche D. Izard J. González-Mañas J.M.

Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 997-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The movement of polypeptide chain segments during pore formation can be restricted by a disulfide formation and viewed as a large decrease in permeabilizing activity. We show that apart from the N-terminal segment there are no other parts, specifically β-sandwich and helix B, that undergo gross conformational changes. Interestingly, mutations of broad loops at the bottom of the molecule abolished hemolytic activity completely, showing the need to preserve primary structure for pore formation. The need for an unperturbed β-sandwich was further and independently confirmed by destabilizing mutants in the β-sandwich. We propose that the flexible N-terminal segment and loops at the bottom of the molecule are the solely parts of the molecule directly involved in the steps that follow the initial binding, whereas the β-sandwich is maintained rigid during all steps of pore formation. Materials—1, 2-Dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine (PC) and brain sphingomyelin (SM) were both from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). All other materials were from Sigma, unless specified differently. Mutant Design—Positions for mutations were selected first by the SSBond program (28Hazes B. Dijkstra B.W. Protein Eng. 1988; 2: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) using EqtII crystal structure as a template (11Athanasiadis A. Anderluh G. Maček P. Turk D. Structure. 2001; 9: 341-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) (PDB code 1IAZ). Additional mutants were selected by manually inspecting the structure and searching for amino acid pairs with suitable Cβ–Cβ distances (between 3.8 and 4.8 Å). These additional mutants were employed to cover all regions of the EqtII molecule. All selected pairs were analyzed by the Scwrl3 program (29Canutescu A.A. Shelenkov A.A. Dunbrack R.L. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 2001-2014Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar) and Swiss-PDB Viewer (www.expasy.org/spdbv/) (30Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9641) Google Scholar). The most suitable rotamer was selected, either by program, in the case of Scwrl3, or manually by the use of Swiss-PDB Viewer, when Scwrl3 did not report in silico disulfide bridge formation. Disulfide bonds could be formed in silico by all mutants used in this study. Cloning, Expression, and Isolation of Mutants—Double cysteine mutants and Trp117 mutants were prepared by replacing the corresponding EqtII residue with the desired amino acid as described previously (31Anderluh G. Barlič A. Podlesek Z. Maček P. Pungerčar J. Gubenšek F. Zecchini M.L. Dalla S. Menestrina G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 128-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Wild-type EqtII and selected mutants were expressed in the E. coli BL21(DE3) strain and isolated from the bacterial cytoplasm exactly as described elsewhere (15Malovrh P. Viero G. Dalla Serra M.

Štrukelj B. Maček P. Gubenšek F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1996; 220: 437-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). All mutants were purified to homogeneity as observed on the SDS-PAGE gels. Treatment of Mutants with Reductant or Oxidant—Double cysteine mutants were treated either with 20 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) or 0.5 mm 1,10-phenantroline and 0.1 mm CuSO4 for 30 min at 37 °C to obtain reduced or oxidized form of the mutants, respectively. These concentrations were sufficient to obtain fully oxidized or reduced samples. Samples were immediately used for hemolytic activity measurements or erythrocytes binding assay. DTT has no effect on cells in these tests, because it was always diluted below 2 mm. Hemolytic Assay—Bacterial lysates were used to assay hemolytic activity of expressed double cysteine mutants. Mutants were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) strain. 20 ml of LB medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin was inoculated with 1 ml of overnight culture. The expression of proteins was induced with final concentration of 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, when bacteria reached an absorbance at 600 nm of ∼0.6, and then grown for additional 4 h. To prepare lysates, bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4 °C and 14,000 × g for 10 min. Pellets were resuspended in 0.5 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, containing ∼2 mg/ml lysozyme. Incubation of samples at room temperature for 15 min was followed by a 30-s pulse of sonication. Supernatants were collected after centrifugation at 4 °C and 14,000 × g for 15 min. The pellets were washed with 0.25 ml of the same buffer, vortexed, sonicated, and centrifuged as above. Supernatants were merged and stored at –20 °C before use. Hemolytic activity was measured turbidimetrically by the use of a microplate reader (MRX; Dynex Technologies, Deckendorf, Germany) (20Malovrh P. Barlič A. Podlesek Z. Maček P. Menestrina G. Anderluh G. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). A suspension of bovine red blood cells (BRBC) with A630 = 0.5 in hemolysis buffer (0.13 m NaCl, 0.02 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) was prepared from well washed BRBC. 100 μl of BRBC suspension were added to 100 μl of 2-fold serially diluted bacterial lysates or purified mutants. Hemolysis was monitored by measuring the absorbance at 630 nm for 20 min at room temperature. The amount of bacterial lysate used for the assay, where reduced and oxidized forms were compared, corresponded to the volume of the lysate that exhibits 50% of maximal hemolytic rate at the dilution 32 or 64 (6th or 7th well in the multiwell plate) in the presence of 2 mm DTT. Binding of Double Cysteine Mutants to Erythrocytes—The binding assay was done as described in Hong et al. (13Hong Q. Gutiérrez-Aguirre I. Barlič A. Malovrh P. Kristan K. Podlesek Z. Maček P. Turk D. González-Mañas J.M. Lakey J.H. Anderluh G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41916-41924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.15 nmol of pretreated protein was incubated with BRBC suspension (A700 = 0.5) in erythrocyte buffer supplemented with 30 mm polyethylene glycol 3350 at 4 °C. After 10 min of incubation, the samples were pelleted and electrophoresis loading buffer was added to the pellets containing erythrocytes with bound toxin. Bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and Western-blotted as described below. SDS-PAGE Electrophoresis—Mini Protean II system (Bio-Rad) was used. 5 μl of bacterial lysates or 0.15 nmol of purified toxins, treated with reductant or oxidant as described above, were mixed with the same volume of SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer (120.5 mm Tris-HCl, 4% SDS (w/v), 10% glycerol (v/v), and 0.002% (w/v) Bromphenol Blue). Proteins were resolved on 15% SDS-PAGE gels. The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue or Western-blotted. For blotting, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore), blocked in 4% bovine serum albumin at 4 °C overnight, and incubated with rabbit anti-EqtII serum for 2 h. Bands were stained with goat anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase using 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole/H2O2. Permeabilizing Assay Using Liposomes—Large unilamellar vesicles were prepared by extrusion of multilamellar vesicles. Lipids, dissolved in chloroform, were spread on the round-bottom glass flask on a rotary evaporator and dried under vacuum for at least 3 h. The lipid film was resuspended in 1 ml of 60 mm calcein in vesicle buffer (140 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 1 mm EDTA) and freeze-thawed six times. Large unilamellar vesicles of 100 nm were extruded through polycarbonate membranes with 100-nm pores by an Avestin lipid extruder (Avestin, Ottawa, Canada) (33MacDonald R.C. MacDonald R.I. Menco B.P. Takeshita K. Subbarao N.K. Hu L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1061: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar). The excess of calcein was removed from the calcein-loaded liposomes by gel filtration on a small G-50 column. For calcein release experiments, liposomes were stirred at the desired concentration at 25 °C. Toxins were added at final 0.05 μm concentration. Changes in the fluorescence intensity were followed on a Jasco FP-750 spectrofluorimeter. Excitation and emission wavelengths were set to 485 and 520 nm, respectively. Excitation and emission slits were set to 5 nm. The permeabilization induced by the toxins was expressed in percentage as compared with the maximal permeabilization obtained at the end of the assay by the addition of Triton X-100 at a final concentration of 2 mm. Critical Pressure Measurements—A MicroTrough S system (Kibron, Helsinki, Finland) was used to perform surface pressure measurements. The aqueous phase consisted of 0.5 ml of 10 mm HEPES, 200 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, at room temperature. The PC/SM 1/1 mixture of lipids, dissolved in chloroform, was gently spread over the surface, until desired initial pressure was achieved. The protein was injected with a Hamilton microsyringe through a hole connected to the subphase. The final protein concentration was 1 μm. The increment in surface pressure versus time was followed until a stable signal was obtained. ANS Binding Assay—The fluorescence of 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid (ANS) in the presence of EqtII or Trp117 mutants in 10 mm HEPES, 200 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, was followed at 468 nm with excitation wavelength set to 370 nm. Excitation and emission slits were set to 5 nm. The cuvette was placed in a thermostatted cell holder, and the contents were stirred continuously. Measurements were taken between 15 and 75 °C by using a 1 °C/min heating rate. The concentration of ANS and protein was 15 and 6 μm, respectively. Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—Circular dichroism (CD) spectra were measured in the far-UV region, 250–185 nm, by Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter. Bandwidth was set to 2 nm; scanning speed was 50 nm/min. Proteins were placed in a 1-mm path-length stoppered cuvette (Hellma) at 8 μm concentration in 10 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.0. The reported spectra are averages of 10 scans. The signal at 217 nm was followed for thermal denaturation that was performed between 20–90 °C at a heating rate of 1 °C/min. Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystals of EqtII double cysteine mutant Val8 → Cys, Lys69 → Cys (8–69) were grown by the sitting drop vapor diffusion method. The reservoir contained 1 ml of 15% polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.12 m ammonium sulfate, 0.06 m sodium acetate, pH 6.0. The drop was composed of 3.7 μl of reservoir solution and 2.3 μl of the protein (10 mg/ml). Diffraction data were collected from a single crystal using CuKα radiation from a Rigaku Ru200 rotating anode x-ray generator and recorded on a 345-mm MAR Research image plate detector. Auto indexing and scaling was done using HKL2000 (34Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). The crystal diffracted to 2.3-Å resolution and belonged to the primitive monoclinic space group P21 with cell dimensions a = 36.6 Å, b = 52.7 Å, c = 39.8 Å, β = 92.3°. The asymmetric unit contained one molecule. Structure Determination and Refinement—The structure of 8–69 mutant was solved by the molecular replacement method implemented in the AMoRe (35Navaza J. Saludjian P. Macromol. Cryst. Pt. A. 1997; 276: 581-594Crossref Scopus (368) Google Scholar) program. The crystal structure of the wild-type equinatoxin (11Athanasiadis A. Anderluh G. Maček P. Turk D. Structure. 2001; 9: 341-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) was used as the search model. In the subsequent structure determination, the program MAIN (36.Turk, D. (1992) Weiterentwicklung eines Programmes für Molekülgraphik und Electronendichte-manipulation und Seine Anwendungen auf Verschiedene Protein-strukturaufklärungen, Dissertation, Technische Universität München, GermanyGoogle Scholar) was used for model building and refinement. The final refinement included all reflections in the resolution range 10–2.3 Å, with the crystallographic R-value being 0.192. The geometry of the final model was inspected with MAIN and Procheck (37Laskowski R.A. Macarthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. App. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). All residues lie in the allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot, 0.913 of residues in most favored regions and 0.087 in additional allowed regions. The coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with the accession code 1TZQ. Preparation of Double Cysteine Mutants—The wild-type EqtII is produced in the active form in the cytoplasm of E. coli. The negative control, the soluble fraction of bacterial cells with pT7 expression vector without EqtII gene, is not hemolytically active (see Fig. 2) (32Anderluh G. Pungerčar J. Štrukelj B. Maček P. Gubenšek F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1996; 220: 437-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Thus any hemolytic activity observed is due to expressed active toxin. The hemolytic assay we use routinely is very sensitive, because nanomolar concentrations of the toxin already produce detectable hemolysis. Conformational changes are expected during pore formation. By introducing two cysteines at appropriate positions in a cysteineless EqtII it is possible to block conformational changes upon disulfide formation. Therefore, twenty-five mutants were designed throughout the molecule covering the N-terminal region (6 mutants), the region around the C-terminal helix B (5 mutants), β-sandwich (11 mutants), and broad loops at the bottom of the molecule (3 mutants) (Fig. 1 and Table I). Positions for mutagenesis were determined by using the program SSBond using EqtII crystal structure as a template. Additional mutants were added to selection, although SSBond did not report them as favorable, on the basis of their Cβ–Cβ distances. The majority of mutants have this distance between 3.8 and 4.8 Å, one of the criteria that needs to be fulfilled for the disulfide formation. This set of mutants covers all regions proposed to be involved in conformational changes during the pore formation, thus enabling us to exclude regions that are not important.Table IMutants used for double cysteine scanningMutantaAmino acids that were mutated to a cysteine are shown in the table by a three-letter code.Structural elements linkedbβ, beta strand; h, helix.

https://openalex.org/W1967286437,"Prolyl-tRNA synthetases (ProRSs) from all three domains of life have been shown to misactivate cysteine and to mischarge cysteine onto tRNAPro. Although most bacterial ProRSs possess an amino acid editing domain that deacylates mischarged Ala-tRNAPro, editing of Cys-tRNAPro has not been demonstrated and a double-sieve mechanism of editing does not appear to be sufficient to eliminate all misacylated tRNAPro species from the cell. It was recently shown that a ProRS paralog, the YbaK protein from Haemophilus influenzae, which is homologous to the ProRS editing domain, is capable of weakly deacylating Ala-tRNAPro. This function appears to be redundant with that of its corresponding ProRS, which contains a canonical bacterial editing domain. In the present study, we test the specificity of editing by H. influenzae YbaK and show that it efficiently edits Cys-tRNAPro and that a conserved Lys residue is essential for this activity. These findings represent the first example of an editing domain paralog possessing altered specificity and suggest that similar autonomous editing domains could act upon different mischarged tRNAs thus providing cells with enhanced proofreading potential. This work also suggests a novel mechanism of editing wherein a third sieve is used to clear Cys-tRNAPro in at least some organisms.

The high fidelity of this process must be ensured for cells to survive (1Orgel L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1963; 49: 517-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar, 2Laughrea M. Exp.

In some cases, the amino acid binding pocket of an aaRS is unable to effectively discriminate among chemically and/or structurally related amino acid substrates. In these cases, the high likelihood of misactivation and misacylation of a noncognate amino acid requires an error correction mechanism (4Freist W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6787-6795Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 5Jakubowski H. Goldman E. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 412-429Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, to ensure the exquisite specificity required for protein synthesis, aaRSs have evolved editing or proofreading functions. Specific hydrolysis of a noncognate aminoacyl-adenylate intermediate occurs via pretransfer editing, whereas a misacylated tRNA is hydrolyzed by a posttransfer editing activity (5Jakubowski H. Goldman E. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 412-429Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both classes of synthetases have been shown to possess editing functions. Class I isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase, leucyl-tRNA synthetase, and valyl-tRNA synthetase use the highly conserved connective polypeptide 1 (CP1) domain to edit a variety of noncognate amino acids (6Baldwin A.N.

Whereas the CP1 editing domain of class I synthetases is highly conserved through evolution, phylogenetic analyses have revealed that the class II-specific editing domain found in all AlaRSs and bacterial and eukaryotic ThrRSs is missing in archaeabacterial ThrRSs. However, a distinct domain for editing has recently been identified in the latter (22Beebe K. Merriman E. De Pouplana L.R. Schimmel P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

S. A. 2003; 100: 15422-15427Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In particular, it was demonstrated that the Haemophilus influenzae YbaK protein specifically hydrolyzes Ala-tRNAPro but not Pro-tRNAProin vitro (18Wong F.C. Beuning P.J. Silvers C. Musier-Forsyth K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52857-52864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). H. influenzae is closely related to Escherichia coli (27Woese C.R. Olsen G.J. Ibba M. Söll D. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 202-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar) and therefore possesses a bacterial type ProRS containing a canonical editing domain with high sequence identity (73%) to the E. coli INS domain. In addition, the H. influenzae tRNAPro/UGG sequence is 96% identical to E. coli tRNAPro/UGG, with only three differences at nonconserved positions in the TψC arm. The function of the H. influenzae YbaK protein in the cell is not known. Its relatively weak Ala-tRNAPro editing activity appears to be redundant with that of full-length ProRS. Interestingly, efficient editing of Ala-tRNAPro was recently demonstrated by another INS domain homolog (designated PrdX) from Clostridium sticklandii, a bacterium that lacks a ProRS editing domain (26Ahel I. Korencic D. Ibba M. Söll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15422-15427Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). This finding and the correlation with the occurrence of the prdX gene in organisms that lack an editing domain in the context of ProRS suggest that editing of Ala-tRNAPro is performed by the autonomous editing domain in vivo. ProRSs from all three domains of life have been shown to misactivate cysteine and to misacylate cysteine onto tRNAPro (19Ahel I. Stathopoulos C. Ambrogelly A. Sauerwald A. Toogood H. Hartsch T.

Moreover, the x-ray crystal structures of ProRS from Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus complexed with Cys- and Pro-sulfamoyl-adenylates show that ProRS accommodates both adenylates in a very similar manner (31Kamtekar S.

This finding provides structural support for the biochemical data showing that discrimination of Pro and Cys does not occur at the level of amino acid binding or adenylate synthesis. Surprisingly, Cys-tRNAPro is resistant to editing by ProRS (28Beuning P.J. Musier-Forsyth K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30779-30785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 29Lipman R.S. Wang J. Sowers K.R. Hou Y.M. J. Mol.

In this work, we investigate the aminoacyl-tRNA specificity of the H. influenzae YbaK protein and provide evidence for the existence of a third sieve that functions in the editing of Cys-tRNAPro.

H. influenzae YbaK protein was purified from E. coli B834 cells containing pCYB2_HI1434 using the IMPACT™ I system (New England Biolabs) as described before (18Wong F.C. Beuning P.J. Silvers C.

The YbaK K46A point mutant was created from plasmid pET15b_HI1434 encoding the wild-type H. influenzae YbaK protein using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Expression of the mutant protein was induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside in BL21(DE3)pLysS cells (Novagen). The protein was purified using Ni2+-NTA resin (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol, followed by removal of the His tag using the thrombin-cleavage capture kit (Novagen). The protein was concentrated using Centricon 10 concentrators (Amicon) and stored in 10 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 0.25 m NaCl, 0.05 mm EDTA, 0.05% Triton, 5mm dithiothreitol, and 40% glycerol. The concentrations of AlaRS-CQ, LysRS, INS, and YbaK proteins were determined by the Bradford assay (37Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215608) Google Scholar). The concentrations of WT AlaRS and WT ProRS were based on the active site titration assay (38Fersht A.R. Ashford J.S. Bruton C.J. Jakes R. Koch G.L. Hartley B.S. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Aminoacylation Assays and Preparation of Aminoacyl-tRNAs—Aminoacylation assays with 3H-labeled amino acids were performed at room temperature as described previously using purified tRNA transcripts prepared in vitro (15Beebe K. Ribas De Pouplana L. Schimmel P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 668-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 39Musier-Forsyth K. Scaringe S. Usman N. Schimmel P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Briefly, E. coli AlaRS-CQ (3.4 μm) was used to aminoacylate the E. coli G1:C72/U70 tRNAPro variant (5.0 μm) in the presence of both [3H]Ser (9.1 μm) and cold Ser (0.5 mm) in buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 4 mm ATP, 20 mm KCl, 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 25 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. E. coli ProRS (0.5 μm) was used to aminoacylate [35S]Cys (50.9 μm) onto E. coli tRNAPro (10 μm) in reaction buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 20 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 25 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 mm ATP as described previously (41Hou Y.M. Westhof E. Giegé R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6776-6780Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In some experiments, E. coli ProRS was premixed with the H. influenzae YbaK protein before initiating the charging reaction. To prepare aminoacyl-tRNAs, [3H]Ala and [3H]Lys were misaminoacylated onto the E. coli G1:C72/U70 tRNAPro variant (8 μm) using WT E. coli AlaRS (2 μm) and WT human LysRS (4 μm), respectively, in the 3H-labeled amino acid buffer given above (16Beuning P.J. Musier-Forsyth K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8916-8920Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). [35S]Cys was mischarged onto E. coli tRNAPro (8 μm) using E. coli ProRS (8 μm) in the [35S]Cys buffer described above. [3H]Ser-tRNAAla and [3H]Gly-tRNAAla were synthesized by mischarging E. coli tRNAAla (8 μm) using E. coli AlaRS-CQ (5.7 μm) as described previously (15Beebe K. Ribas De Pouplana L. Schimmel P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 668-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The mischarged tRNAs were purified by repeated phenol extractions, followed by ethanol precipitation. The aminoacyl-tRNAs were quantified by scintillation counting and stored at –20 °C in 50 mm KPO4 (pH 5.0). Deacylation Assays—Deacylation assays were carried out at room temperature according to published conditions (16Beuning P.J. Musier-Forsyth K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8916-8920Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 29Lipman R.S. Wang J. Sowers K.R. Hou Y.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 943-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Reactions contained ∼0.8 μm [3H]Gly-tRNAAla, 1.2 μm [3H]Ser-tRNAAla, 0.5 μm [3H]Ala-tRNAPro, 0.1 μm [3H]Lys-tRNAPro, or 0.2 μm [35S]Cys-tRNAPro and were initiated with the amount of protein indicated in the figure legends. In each case, a background reaction was carried out in which buffer (0.15 m KPO4 (pH 7.0)) was used to initiate the reaction. Each aminoacyl-tRNA had its own background reaction, although for clarity only one representative data set is shown in the figures. To study the substrate specificity of the deacylation activity of the H. influenzae YbaK protein, we synthesized various aminoacyl-tRNAs, including Ala-, Lys-, and Cys-tRNAPro and Ser- and Gly-tRNAAla. The tRNA transcripts possessed ∼70% acceptor activity on the basis of plateau-level aminoacylation assays with cognate amino acid. Our initial deacylation assays used high concentrations of purified YbaK protein (21 μm), similar to previous studies (18Wong F.C. Beuning P.J. Silvers C. Musier-Forsyth K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52857-52864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, under these conditions we observe similar levels of deacylation of Ala-tRNAPro and Ser- and Gly-tRNAAla. In contrast, hydrolysis of Lys-tRNAPro was not observed, which is in agreement with previous studies using E. coli ProRS (16Beuning P.J. Musier-Forsyth K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8916-8920Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Strikingly, the YbaK protein was capable of rapidly hydrolyzing Cys-tRNAPro under these conditions (Fig. 1). We next tested the deacylation of the same set of aminoacyl-tRNAs using lower concentrations of YbaK (1.0 μm). Under these conditions, nearly complete deacylation (∼90%) of Cys-tRNAPro was observed after 20 min, but hydrolysis of the other aminoacyl-tRNAs, including Ala-tRNAPro, was not detectable (Fig. 2A). In contrast, under similar reaction conditions, E. coli ProRS hydrolyzed Ala-tRNAPro but not Cys-tRNAPro (Fig. 2B). Thus, the YbaK protein appears to be specific for Cys-tRNAPro, while ProRS is specific for Ala-tRNAPro. As shown in Fig. 1, even in the presence of high concentrations of YbaK, hydrolysis of Lys-tRNAPro was not observed. Therefore, it is unlikely that an RNase contaminant is responsible for the Cys deacylation activity of the YbaK protein. To confirm that the editing reaction involves specific removal of the amino acid rather than cleavage by a nuclease, we showed that Cys-tRNAPro, which had been hydrolyzed by YbaK and recovered via phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, could be re-aminoacylated with Pro by ProRS (data not shown). The extent of charging observed corresponded to the level expected based on the acceptor activity of the tRNA. To determine whether the YbaK protein was functional in the presence of ProRS, aminoacylation assays were performed with E. coli ProRS in the absence and presence of varying concentrations of the YbaK protein. A concentration-dependent decrease in aminoacylation was observed in the presence of YbaK, with almost complete (∼90%) elimination of charging achieved at a ProRS:YbaK ratio of 1:4 (Fig. 3). Thus, the YbaK protein performs its trans-editing reaction in the presence of a functional ProRS, thereby preventing Cys-tRNAPro from being used in protein synthesis. A strictly conserved Lys residue (Lys279 in E. coli ProRS) present in all bacterial ProRS editing domains was previously shown to be critical for posttransfer editing of Ala-tRNAPro by E. coli ProRS (17Wong F.C. Beuning P.J. Nagan M. Shiba K. Musier-Forsyth K. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7108-7115Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This amino acid is also found in the YbaK protein family (Lys46 in H. influenzae YbaK). To determine whether this Lys residue is important for Cys editing, we mutated Lys46 to Ala in H. influenzae YbaK. Strikingly, this single point mutation abolished Cys-tRNAPro deacylation activity even at high concentrations of the mutant protein (21 μm) (Fig. 4). In addition, K46A YbaK also failed to deacylate Ala-tRNAPro (data not shown). The Lys46 residue lies within the putative substrate-binding pocket of the H. influenzae YbaK protein (23Zhang H. Huang K. Li Z. Banerjei L. Fisher K.E. Grishin N.V. Eisenstein E. Herzberg O. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2000; 40: 86-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Although its precise role in catalysis is unknown, the mutagenesis data suggest that this highly conserved Lys is a key catalytic residue of the protein family. The separately cloned INS domain from E. coli ProRS was previously demonstrated to possess posttransfer editing activity (18Wong F.C. Beuning P.J. Silvers C. Musier-Forsyth K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52857-52864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). To establish whether the Ala specificity observed for editing by ProRS depends on protein domains outside of the editing domain or whether it is inherent to the INS domain, we tested the cloned INS domain for editing of Cys-tRNAPro. Whereas the cloned INS displayed a similar level of deacylation activity of Ala-tRNAPro as the YbaK protein, no hydrolysis of Cys-tRNAPro was observed, even in the presence of high concentrations of INS (10 μm) (data not shown). Thus, the substrate specificity is dictated by residues within the INS domain rather than by other regions of ProRS. The findings reported here demonstrate at least one mechanism by which cells can survive despite the fact that they possess a ProRS that misactivates Pro and Cys with similar efficiencies. Previous studies had suggested that a double-sieve mechanism (32Fersht A.R. Dingwall C. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2627-2631Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 33Fersht A.R. Science. 1998; 280: 541Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 34Nureki O. Vassylyev D.G. Tateno M. Shimada A. Nakama T. Fukai S. Konno M. Hendrickson T.L. Schimmel P. Yokoyama S. Science. 1998; 280: 578-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) for ProRS editing cleared Ala-tRNAPro but was not capable of eliminating Cys-tRNAPro species. In particular, whereas all three amino acids (Pro, Ala, and Cys) pass through the course sieve (i.e. the aminoacylation active site) and are thus activated, only the smaller amino acid (Ala) enters into the second sieve and is edited, while Cys and Pro, which have similar molecular volumes (31Kamtekar S. Kennedy W.D. Wang J. Stathopoulos C. Söll D. Steitz T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1673-1678Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), are rejected by this fine sieve. As shown in Fig. 2A, to eliminate Cys-tRNAPro, the mischarged tRNA appears to enter a third sieve and undergo a second round of proofreading by an autonomous trans-editing protein. Intriguingly, previous studies suggest that not all INS domain homologs can hydrolyze Cys-tRNAPro as demonstrated here for the H. influenzae YbaK protein. In particular, a recent report demonstrated selective and efficient hydrolysis of Ala-tRNAPro but not Cys-tRNAPro by the INS domain homolog from the bacterium C. sticklandii (CSPrdX) (26Ahel I. Korencic D. Ibba M. Söll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15422-15427Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The ProRS expressed from C. sticklandii is classified as “eukaryotic like” and lacks the bacterial-specific editing domain. Unlike H. influenzae, which possesses both a ProRS with a canonical editing domain responsible for eliminating Ala-tRNAPro and a YbaK protein with Cys-specific editing activity, the CSPrdX protein appears to be specific for Ala-tRNAPro. Thus, the data obtained to date suggest the existence of at least two distinct classes of free-standing aa-tRNAPro trans-editing factors, i.e. those with Ala specificity (ProX) and those with Cys specificity (YbaK). The mechanism for Cys-tRNAPro editing in C. sticklandii or in other species that appear to lack both a functional editing domain within ProRS and a YbaK protein (such as Methanococcus jannaschii and Saccharomyces cerevisiae) is still unknown. Some species may contain a ProRS that is more specific to start with and thus do not require editing (26Ahel I. Korencic D. Ibba M. Söll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15422-15427Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). However, this is unlikely to be the explanation in the case of M. jannaschii ProRS, which very efficiently activates Cys and mischarges it onto tRNAProin vitro (19Ahel I. Stathopoulos C.

Musier-Forsyth K. Hou Y.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). An alternative mechanism that has been proposed involves regulation of intracellular Pro and Cys levels, which when combined with the higher Km for Cys over Pro, may prevent mischarging (30Ambrogelly A. Ahel I. Polycarpo C. Bunjun-Srihari S. Krett B. Jacquin-Becker C. Ruan B. Kohrer C. Stathopoulos C. RajBhandary U.L. Söll D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34749-34754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Finally, an additional unidentified factor present in these species may prevent Cys-tRNAPro formation or function to hydrolyze it, as was demonstrated here for the H. influenzae YbaK protein. In conclusion, the double-sieve mechanism for editing does not appear to be sufficient to eliminate all misacylated tRNAPro species in some organisms. In particular, some bacteria, which contain a ProRS editing domain that clears Ala-tRNAPro, additionally require an autonomous editing domain paralog that is specific for editing Cys-tRNAPro. Although we have demonstrated that the highly conserved residue Lys46 is critical for the editing activity, the detailed mechanism of trans-editing, as well as the molecular basis for the altered amino acid specificity of the free-standing editing domain, remain to be determined. A recent search using the Conserved Domain Architecture Retrieval Tool (CDART available at ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) identified 143 ProRSs containing a sequence homologous to the H. influenzae YbaK protein either as an internal domain or an N-terminal extension and an additional 213 homologous proteins expressed as independent domains. Additional studies of these intriguing ProRS paralogs from a variety of organisms will be required to gain a better understanding of how specific aminoacyl-tRNA synthesis is achieved in living cells. We thank Dr. Osnat Herzberg (University of Maryland) for kindly providing us with the expression plasmids for the H. influenzae YbaK protein and Dr. Paul Schimmel (The Scripps Research Institute) for providing the expression plasmid encoding E. coli AlaRS-CQ."

The protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei is the etiological agent of African sleeping sickness. The cysteine protease activity of this organism is a validated drug target as first recognized by the killing of the parasite with the diazomethane inhibitor Z-Phe-Ala-CHN2 (where Z is benzyloxycarbonyl). Whereas the presumed target of this inhibitor was rhodesain (also brucipain, trypanopain), the major cathepsin L-like cysteine protease of T. brucei, genomic analysis has now identified tbcatB, a cathepsin B-like cysteine protease as a possible inhibitor target. The mRNA of tbcatB is more abundantly expressed in the bloodstream versus the procyclic form of the parasite. Induction of RNA interference against rhodesain did not result in an abnormal phenotype in cultured T. brucei. However, induction of RNA interference against tbcatB led to enlargement of the endosome, accumulation of fluorescein isothiocyanate-transferrin, defective cytokinesis after completion of mitosis, and ultimately the death of cultured parasites. Therefore, tbcatB, but not rhodesain, is essential for T. brucei survival in culture and is the most likely target of the diazomethane protease inhibitor Z-Phe-Ala-CHN2 in T. brucei.

The Clan CA cysteine proteases include the papain-related proteases of plants and the lysosomal cathepsins of mammalian cells. Recent genomic and biochemical studies of protozoa and primitive metazoa suggested that there was an explosion of gene diversity in this family coincident with the evolution of the first eukaryotic cell (1Barrett A.J. Tolle D.P. Rawlings N.D. Biol. Chem. 2003; 384: 873-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In contrast to higher plants and most mammalian cells, the cysteine proteases of primitive protozoa and metazoa function in a variety of chemical environments and cellular compartments (2Sajid M. McKerrow J.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 120: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar, 3Ward W. Alvarado L. Rawlings N.D. Engel J.C. Franklin C. McKerrow J.H.

Therefore, the biological importance and distribution of cysteine proteases is much greater than originally proposed for the cathepsins. Because primitive protozoa include many of the major parasitic organisms of humans and domestic animals, parallel studies of the pathogenesis of parasitic diseases have underscored the importance of Clan CA proteases as virulence factors. Furthermore, considerable progress has been made in targeting these proteases for the development of new antiparasitic chemotherapy (2Sajid M. McKerrow J.H. Mol. Biochem.

Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11015-11022Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). One notable observation in this regard was that the benzyloxycarbonyl-phenylalanine-alanine diazomethane cysteine protease inhibitor (Z-Phe-Ala-CHN2) 1The abbreviations used are: Z-Phe-Ala-CHN2, benzyloxycarbonylphenylalanine-alanine diazomethane; RNAi, RNA interference; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; DAPI, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. was lethal to Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of African sleeping sickness, in vitro and in vivo (8Scory S. Caffrey C.R. Stierhof Y.D. Ruppel A. Steverding D. Exp. Parasitol. 1999; 91: 327-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 9Shaw E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2768-2772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The presumptive target for this inhibitor was a cathepsin L-like protease, rhodesain, isolated from T. brucei rhodesiense and the homologue of brucipain, trypanopain, or congopain in other Trypanosoma species (10Lalmanach G. Boulange A. Serveau C. Lecaille F. Scharfstein J. Gauthier F. Authie E. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 739-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 11Nkemgu N.J. Grande R. Hansell E. McKerrow J.H. Caffrey C.R. Steverding D. Int. J. Antimicrob. Agents. 2003; 22: 155-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, peptide diazomethanes are relatively non-selective irreversible cysteine protease inhibitors, and recent genomic analysis of trypanosomes suggested that a repertoire of Clan CA protease genes might be present. To identify and validate the target of Z-Phe-Ala-CHN2 in T. brucei, as well as to clarify its biological function, a genomic scan using papain as a probe was first undertaken. The previously characterized cathepsin L-like cysteine protease, rhodesain (12Caffrey C.R. Hansell E. Lucas K.D. Brinen L.S. Alvarez Hernandez A. Cheng J. Gwaltney 2nd, S.L. Roush W.R. Stierhof Y.D. Bogyo M. Steverding D. McKerrow J.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 118: 61-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), was identified as expected, but a second cathepsin B-like gene product was also discovered. Subsequent expression, biochemical analysis, and localization studies suggested that the cathepsin B-like protease in T. brucei was a plausible target for the diazomethane inhibitor. Therefore, to clarify the roles of both the T. brucei cathepsin B and cathepsin L homologues, RNA interference (RNAi) was used in conjunction with radiolabeled active site probes. Identification of Clan CA Cysteine Proteases in the T. brucei Ge nome—The 159 amino acid sequence Cys-19 to Asn-178 representing the active site of papain, EC 3.4.22.2, was used to search (by BLAST) the T. brucei genomic data bases from the Sanger Center and the Institute for Genomic Research for cysteine protease homologues. Subcloning of TbcatB cDNA into Escherichia coli—Reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions were carried out using the One Step with Platinum Taq kit (Invitrogen). Two micrograms of total RNA from T. brucei were mixed with the splice leader primer, TbSL 5′-ATTATTAGAACAGTTTCTGTACTATATTG-3′, plus the reverse primer, TbCatBXhoIR 5′-GCTAATATCTCAGATACGCCGTGTTGGGTGCA-3′, to amplify the full-length cDNA of tbcatB. To amplify the open reading frame of tbcatB for recombinant expression, the primers TbCatBBHIF, 5′-GTCTATAGGATCCATGCATCTCATGCGTGCCT-3′, and TbGSTHisR 5′-GTCGACGAGATGGAGATGGAGATGCGCCGTGTT-3′, were used. All of the amplified products were subcloned into the TOPO TA cloning vector and transformed into competent E. coli for propagation (Invitrogen). Purification of Recombinant tbcatB from E. coli—One liter of Terrific Broth (Invitrogen) containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin was inoculated with 5 ml of E. coli expressing the pGSTbcatBHis plasmid. The E. coli were incubated at 37 °C until the A600 reached 1.0 and then induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm for 5 h. Bacteria were centrifuged at 9,000 × g for 15 min using a Beckman JLA 10.5000 rotor. After centrifugation, the pellet was resuspended in 50 ml of sonication buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol) and sonicated on ice five times for 2-min intervals with 3-min breaks between each interval. The crude lysate was cleared by centrifugation for 15 min at 25,000 × g. The cleared supernatant was decanted, and the pellet was resuspended in 50 ml of guanidine HCl buffer (6 m guanidine HCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaH2PO4)for 2 h at room temperature. After 2 h, the lysate was cleared by centrifugation, and 10 ml of equilibrated nickel-agarose beads (Qiagen) in 50% slurry were added to the cleared lysate. The beads were incubated with the lysate for 3 h at room temperature. The mixture was poured into a 10-ml gravity column and washed with guanidine HCl buffer, pH 8.0. The recombinant 6-His tagged protein was eluted from the beads according to the manufacturer's manual (Qiagen). Three microliters from each fraction were mixed with 2 μl of SDS loading dye and examined by SDS-PAGE. Peak fractions were pooled and dialyzed three times in 1 liter of dialysis buffer (50 mm Tris,pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 3.0 m urea), and 1.5 mg of protein was sent to AnimalPharm, Inc. for production of rabbit polyclonal antibodies. Northern Blot Analysis of T. brucei RNA—T. brucei total RNA was purified from 108 parasites using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Thirty micrograms of total RNA were loaded on a 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde gel and resolved by electrophoresis at 50 V for 2.5 h. After electrophoresis, the RNA was transferred to polyvinylidene diflouride membrane and cross-linked to the membrane with a Stratalinker (Stratagene). 32P-Labeled cDNA probes were generated using the random primed labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences). The probes were denatured at 100 °C and hybridized to the blot overnight at 42 °C in buffer containing 50% formamide, 5× SSC, 4× Denhardt's solution, 0.1% SDS, and 0.1% sodium pyrophosphate. Culturing of T. brucei—Procyclic T. brucei strain 427 was incubated at 27 °C without carbon dioxide and maintained in complete Cunningham's media containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1× penicillin/streptomycin. The transgenic bloodstream form T. brucei clone 90-13 was a gift from the laboratory of George A. M. Cross (15Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar). Bloodstream parasites were incubated in 5% CO2 at 37 °C in HMI-9 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 10% Serum Plus (Omega Scientific), 1× penicillin/streptomycin with 5.0 μg/ml hygromycin B, and 2.5 μg/ml G418. Introduction of RNAi Transgenes into Bloodstream T. brucei by Elec troporation—For electroporation, 108 parasites were pelleted by centrifugation and washed twice with 10 ml of cytomix (120 mm KCl, 150 μm CaCl2, 10 mm K2HPO4/KH2PO4, pH 7.6, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 2 mm EGTA, pH 7.6, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.6, adjusted with KOH) (16van den Hoff M.J. Christoffels V.M. Labruyere W.T. Moorman A.F. Lamers W.H. Methods Mol. Biol. 1995; 48: 185-197PubMed Google Scholar). After the second wash, the parasites were resuspended in 0.5 ml of cytomix. The plasmid pZJM, which allows for stable tetracycline-inducible expression of double-stranded RNA in T. brucei, was a gift from the laboratory of Paul T. Englund (17Wang Z. Morris J.C. Drew M.E. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40174-40179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). One hundred micrograms of pZJM vector containing the first 597 nucleotides of the rhodesain cDNA (pZJMTbRho) or nucleotides 300–1020 of the tbcatB cDNA (pZJMTbCB) were linearized with NotI restriction endonuclease and precipitated with ethanol. The DNA was resuspended in 100 μl of cytomix buffer and mixed with the 0.5-ml suspension of T. brucei in a 4-mm electroporator cuvette. The parasites were pulsed with 1.7 kV and 25 microfarads. After pulsing, the parasites were transferred to 24 ml of complete medium and incubated overnight at 37 °C with 5% CO2. To select for parasites stably expressing the transgenes, phleomycin was added to the parasites at a concentration of 2.5 μg/ml, and the parasites were aliquoted in a 24-well plate for 7–12 days. Stably transfected parasites were maintained in complete medium containing 2.5 μg/ml phleomycin. Induction of the double-stranded RNA in bloodstream parasites was carried out by adding tetracycline to a final concentration of 100 ng/ml. Western Blots of RNAi Clones—T. brucei were either induced for 24 h with 100 ng/ml tetracycline or maintained uninduced. The parasites were lysed with Tb lysis buffer (1.0% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris pH 7.5, 25 mm KCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol), and 25 μg of crude lysate was resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. After transferring and blocking, the polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were incubated with rabbit anti-tbcatB (1:2,000 dilution) or anti-rhodesain antiserum (1:5,000 dilution) (12Caffrey C.R. Hansell E. Lucas K.D. Brinen L.S. Alvarez Hernandez A. Cheng J. Gwaltney 2nd, S.L. Roush W.R. Stierhof Y.D. Bogyo M. Steverding D. McKerrow J.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 118: 61-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) for 1 h and washed three times for 5 min with TBST (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.4% Tween 20). After the third wash, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:1,000 dilution) was added to the blots for 1 h. The blots were then washed again in the same buffer three times for 5 min and then examined by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorter (FACS) Analysis and 4,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) Staining—For FACS analysis, parasites were fixed overnight in 70% methanol and 30% phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C. Afterward, the parasites were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended to 106 cells/ml. RNase A and propidium iodide were added to the cells to a final concentration of 10 μg/ml each and incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. FACS analysis was performed with a Becton Dickinson FACScalibur using FL2-H. Data analysis was carried out with either FlowJo version 4.52 or CellQuest version 3.3. Analyzing Degradation Fluorescein Isothiocyanate (FITC)-transferrin in T. brucei—FITC-conjugated bovine transferrin (Sigma) was resuspended at 1 mg/ml in 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4. Parasites were incubated in HMI-9 medium containing 15 μg/ml FITC-conjugated bovine transferrin at 37 °C and 5% carbon dioxide for 3 h. The parasites were then washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and fixed in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer containing 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 1.6% paraformaldehyde and applied to poly-L-lysine-coated slides. Parasites were visualized using an Axioskop2 microscope (Zeiss). Identification of Clan CA Cysteine Protease Active Sites with 125I-Labeled Inhibitors—Ten million T. brucei cultured in 10 ml of complete HMI-9 medium at 37 °C and 5% carbon dioxide were incubated with 125I-JPM565 for 2 h (18Meara J.P. Rich D.H. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 3357-3366Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). After 2 h, the parasites were pelleted by centrifugation at 900 × g for 20 min with a Beckman GH 3.8A rotor and lysed in 100 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm sodium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, pH 5.5) for 1 h on ice. Alternatively, 10 million unlabeled parasites were pelleted and lysed using identical conditions. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C in Eppendorf tubes. The protein concentration of the cleared lysates was determined by Bradford assay, and equal amounts of parasite lysates were labeled with 125I-MB-074 for 1 h at 25 °C (19Bogyo M. Verhelst S. Bellingard-Dubouchaud V. Toba S. Greenbaum D. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: 27-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Quantification of labeled enzymes was determined by PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics). T. brucei Viability Assay—Uninduced control or tetracycline-induced T. brucei were grown in a T-25 flask under standard conditions for 48 h. After 48 h, 100 μl of the cultures were aliquoted into white opaque 96-well plates. To assay for viability, an equal volume of CellTiterGlo™ (Promega) was added to the corresponding wells. The mixture was placed on an orbital shaker at room temperature for 5 min before reading the plates with a SpectraFluor Plus multidetection plate reader (Tecan). Alternatively, 48 h after tetracycline induction, the parasites were counted by hemocytometer. Identification of TbcatB, a Cathepsin B-like Homologue in T. brucei—Using the highly conserved catalytic region of papain as a probe, we searched T. brucei data bases for homologues to papain. From this search, cathepsin L-like and cathepsin B-like protease sequences were identified. The cDNAs encoding these two gene products were amplified from T. brucei RNA by reverse transcriptase PCR, subcloned, and sequenced. The 1.3-kb cDNA encoded a 450-amino acid polypeptide with a predicted Mr of 48,431 identical to rhodesain (or brucipain or trypanopain), the previously characterized cathepsin L-like protease identified by biochemical assays in T. brucei lysates (20Pamer E.G. Davis C.E. Eakin A. So M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6141Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The 1.0-kb cDNA encoded a cathepsin B-like protease, tbcatB, having 341 amino acids with a predicted Mr of 37,223. The tbcatB open reading frame contained each of the conserved motifs identified in the active site of lysosomal cathepsins including the residues that form the catalytic triad, Cys-42, His-282, and Asn-302 (tbcatB numbering). The tbcatB open reading frame also encodes two conserved motifs identified in cathepsin B family proteases: Gly-Cys-Xaa-Gly-Gly, which is identical to human cathepsin B (residues 70–74), and an occluding loop motif that is thought to be responsible for the exopeptidase activity of cathepsin B-like proteases (21Illy C. Quraishi O. Wang J. Purisima E. Vernet T. Mort J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1197-1202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The tbcatB sequence has been deposited in the GenBank™ data base under accession number AY508515. Examination of Rhodesain and TbcatB mRNA Expression in T. brucei—Rhodesain has been characterized extensively with synthetic peptides demonstrating that it was the major cysteine protease activity in T. brucei (22Lonsdale-Eccles J.D. Grab D.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 169: 467-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 23Robertson C.D. North M.J. Lockwood B.C. Coombs G.H. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1990; 136: 921-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 24Huet G. Richet C. Demeyer D. Bisiau H. Soudan B. Tetaert D. Han K.K. Degand P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1138: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Consistent with it being the most abundantly expressed cysteine protease gene product in T. brucei, genomic analysis has indicated that there were between 10 and 20 copies of the rhodesain gene repeated in tandem (25Mottram J.C. North M.J. Barry J.D. Coombs G.H. FEBS Lett. 1989; 258: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). We examined the mRNA expression of rhodesain and tbcatB to elucidate their relative abundance in the two major developmental stages of T. brucei. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that the amounts of rhodesain mRNA expressed in either the bloodstream (mammalian host stage) or the procyclic (insect stage) forms of the parasite were equivalent (Fig. 2A). In shorter exposures of the autoradiography, the rhodesain mRNA could be visualized as a doublet in the RNA from both forms of the parasite. These mRNA results were surprising because studies from previous protein expression assays concluded that rhodesain protein was up-regulated in the bloodstream-form parasites (12Caffrey C.R. Hansell E. Lucas K.D. Brinen L.S. Alvarez Hernandez A. Cheng J. Gwaltney 2nd, S.L. Roush W.R. Stierhof Y.D. Bogyo M. Steverding D. McKerrow J.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 118: 61-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). It is therefore reasonable to conclude that rhodesain, like its homologue in Trypanosoma cruzi, may be translationally regulated in procyclic parasites. We used gene-specific probes to hybridize to tbcatB mRNA for Northern blot analysis. Our results demonstrated that tbcatB mRNA was less abundantly expressed than rhodesain mRNA in both developmental stages of T. brucei; however, the sizes of the two transcripts were very similar. To avoid ambiguous results, we carried out the tbcatB and rhodesain blots in parallel rather than using blots that were stripped and reprobed. Northern blot analysis also demonstrated that the message for tbcatB was up-regulated in the bloodstream-form parasites (Fig. 2B). The differential expression of tbcatB observed in the bloodstream-form versus procyclic parasites suggests that in contrast to rhodesain, tbcatB is regulated at the transcriptional level. Up-regulation of tbcatB mRNA in the bloodstream-form parasites suggests that it may primarily function in the bloodstream parasites. Silencing of Rhodesain mRNA Expression in T. brucei—To examine the consequences of inhibiting the activity of each protease in T. brucei, RNAi was used to silence the mRNA expression of rhodesain or tbcatB. We used tetracycline to induce RNAi in T. brucei, stably expressing the rhodesain, pZJMTbRho (or tbcatB), or pZJMTbCB transgenes. The tetracycline-induced pZJMTbRho parasites did not exhibit visible phenotypic abnormalities, signs of cell cycle defects, or changes in growth rate compared with the uninduced parasites. Total RNA from induced and control parasites was extracted and analyzed by Northern blot analysis 24 h postinduction. The rhodesain probe hybridized with two distinct messages on the Northern blot with about equal intensity. Because the Northern blot analysis was carried out on total RNA, the two transcripts recognized by the probe could have arisen if the rhodesain gene lay within a cluster of related genes as described for the cathepsin L-like genes of Leishmania species (26Mundodi V. Somanna A. Farrell P.J. Gedamu L. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 282: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the two transcripts may represent a mixture of mature rhodesain mRNAs and either immature or alternatively processed transcripts. In either case, both of these transcripts were reduced to almost undetectable levels after tetracycline-induced RNAi was done in these parasites (Fig. 3A). Immunoblot analysis was used to compare the amount of rhodesain in control parasites with the amount in RNAi-silenced parasites. Affinity-purified rabbit anti-rhodesain antibodies recognized two bands, 45 and 47 kDa, in the Western blots of control parasites. These two bands could reflect that rhodesain has become glycosylated because a cryptic glycosylation site has been identified (12Caffrey C.R. Hansell E. Lucas K.D. Brinen L.S. Alvarez Hernandez A. Cheng J. Gwaltney 2nd, S.L. Roush W.R. Stierhof Y.D. Bogyo M. Steverding D. McKerrow J.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 118: 61-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and these antibodies do not distinguish between glycosylated and non-glycosylated forms of rhodesain. Recently, it has been demonstrated that a species of mammalian cathepsin L is able to initiate translation from a second downstream methionine codon and become translocated into the nucleus (27Goulet B. Baruch A. Moon N.S. Poirier M. Sansregret L.L. Erickson A. Bogyo M. Nepveu A. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 207-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Rhodesain is a cathepsin L-like protease that also contains several downstream methionine codons where translation can initiate. Initiation at a downstream methionine codon may also account for the second species of rhodesain detected by the antibodies. In either case, these two bands were nearly undetectable by the same antibodies in extracts where rhodesain expression was silenced in parasites by RNAi (Fig. 3B). To confirm the effects of mRNA silencing on protease activity in vivo, we used JPM565, a derivative of E-64, the irreversible inhibitor of papain and other cysteine proteases. E-64 and its derivatives form a thioether bond with the sulfhydryl group in the active center of cysteine proteases, and they are therefore ideal for active site titration because 1 mol of the inhibitor inhibits 1 mol of protease (28Barrett A.J. Kembhavi A.A. Brown M.A. Kirschke H. Knight C.G. Tamai M. Hanada K. Biochem. J. 1982; 201: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). Furthermore, JPM565 has a preference for cathepsin L-like proteases and can be iodinated allowing quantitative analysis to be carried out on labeled proteases (18Meara J.P. Rich D.H. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 3357-3366Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 29Shi G. Munger J. Meara J. Rich D. Chapman H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7258-7262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When control parasites were incubated with 125I-JPM565, both species of rhodesain were detected by the label (Fig. 3C). The tetracycline-induced parasites showed a 65% reduction in labeling of rhodesain by 125I-JPM565 (Fig. 3D). Together these observations suggested that rhodesain was not essential for parasite replication in culture. Knock Down of TbcatB Leads to Dysmorphism and Death of T. brucei—When the pZJMTbCB clones were induced with tetracycline, distension of the posterior endosome/lysosome compartment of the parasites was easily visualized within 12 h postinduction (Fig. 4). Distension of these RNAi-induced parasites in the region of the endosome reached a maximum by 24 h postinduction. In addition to posterior swelling, some RNAi-induced parasites displayed multiple flagella that looked similar to uninduced control parasites undergoing cytokinesis (Fig. 4A, Phase Contrast). To examine the consequences of endosome/lysosome dysfunction in the parasites, we used DAPI to stain nuclear DNA and kinetoplast DNA (which is the mitochondrial DNA equivalent in T. brucei) of control and induced parasites. In uninduced controls, the population was composed of non-dividing parasites containing one kinetoplast and one nucleus, parasites undergoing kinetoplast division and segregation containing two kinetoplasts and one nucleus, and parasites undergoing nuclear mitosis containing two kinetoplasts and two nuclei. These observations were consistent with the control parasites existing as an asynchronous population (30Woodward R. Gull K. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 95: 49-57Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The nuclei of RNAi-induced pZJMTbCB clones were stained with DAPI 24 h postinduction. These clones demonstrated a dramatic increase in the number of parasites containing two kinetoplasts and two nuclei, but no parasites containing one kinetoplast and one nucleus were detected 48 h postinduction (Fig. 4A, DAPI). The DNA content of control or induced parasites was then analyzed by flow cytometry to verify the karyotype results observed by microscopy. In the uninduced control population, a similar number of parasites contained either non-replicating 2C or postmitotic 4C DNA. A similar profile was observed in the parental 90-13 and wild-type 221 bloodstream-form parasites consistent with uninduced parasites existing as an asynchronous population (data not shown). After 24 h of tetracycline induction, the majority of parasites observed contained 4C DNA or greater, suggesting that the tetracycline-induced population of parasites was arrested in cytokinesis after completing several rounds of DNA synthesis and mitosis (Fig. 4A, FACS). No proliferation in the pZJMTbCB clones was detected by either direct counting with a hemocytomer or by a luciferase-based proliferation assay that detects adenosine triphosphate generation by 48 h postinduction (Fig. 4B) (31Crouch S.P. Kozlowski R. Slater K.J. Fletcher J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1993; 160: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). The tetracycline-induced parasites died by 72 h postinduction. These abnormalities were not observed in uninduced control parasites where normal proliferation occurred. We carried out dosage-dependent induction of the parental 90-13 strain versus pZJMTbCB clones. After 48 h of induction, the proliferation of the 90-13 strain was not affected at any of the concentrations of tetracycline, indicating that this drug does not produce any toxic effects on T. brucei. Proliferation of the pZJMTbCB clones was inhibited at tetracycline concentrations as low as 1 ng/ml, showing dosage-dependent inhibition of proliferation by RNAi. The parasites that remain at 1 ng/ml of tetracycline may represent those that inefficiently produce RNAi having a more modest reduction in mRNA for tbcatB (Fig. 4C). The effect of RNAi on tbcatB protease in the parasites was examined by Western blot analysis. A modest but significant decrease in the amount of tbcatB protein was detected in the extracts of the induced parasites versus the control parasites (Fig. 4D). We used the cathepsin B-specific inhibitor MB-074 to confirm reduction of cathepsin B activity in the tetracycline-induced clones. MB-074 is a derivative of CA-074 that binds specifically to the occluding loop found in cathepsin B-like proteases but not other cysteine proteases (32Turk D. Podobnik M. Popovic T. Katunuma N. Bode W. Huber R. Turk V. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4791-4797Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). MB-074 has a tyramine group that allows it to be labeled by 125I. The labeled inhibitor was added to crude lysates of control or tetracycline-induced pZJMTbCB clones and resolved by SDS-PAGE for quantitative analysis. A 34-kDa band consistent in size with the band recognized by tbcatB antibodies was labeled by 125IMB-074 in both extracts, but a slight decrease in the 34 kDa band was visualized in the extracts of the induced parasites (Fig. 4E). When the intensities of the labeled bands from the extracts were compared by PhosphorImager analysis, a 32% reduction of the 34 kDa protein was observed in the extracts of the RNAi-induced parasites (Fig. 4F). TbcatB but Not Rhodesain Is Required for Degradation of Transferrin—Because they lack cytochromes, the bloodstream form of T. brucei acquires iron from the host by internalizing transferrin through receptor-mediated endocytosis. The host transferrin is then rapidly degraded in the “endosome/lysosome” located between the nucleus and kinetoplast of the parasite. Because of the observation that tbcatB RNAi led to swelling of this compartment, FITC-transferrin was used to assay the effect that knocking down tbcatB had on the ability of the parasites to degrade this key host protein. No accumulation of FITC-transferrin was detected in uninduced control pZJMTbCB clones indicating that the ability of the parasites to degrade transferrin was not hindered. However, when the clones were induced by tetracycline, FITC-transferrin began to accumulate throughout the parasite and within the endosome/lysosome, suggesting that their ability to efficiently and effectively degrade transferrin was hindered (Fig. 5A). A similar accumulation of FITC-transferrin was also previously reported when T. brucei were treated with the cysteine protease inhibitor Z-Phe-Ala-CHN2 (8Scory S. Caffrey C.R. Stierhof Y.D. Ruppel A. Steverding D. Exp. Parasitol. 1999; 91: 327-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). No accumulation of FITC-transferrin was detected in control pZJMTbRho parasites or in tetracycline-induced pZJMTbRho clones, indicating that knocking down rhodesain activity in the parasites does not interfere with the ability of the parasites to degrade transferrin (Fig. 5B). Scory et al. (8Scory S. Caffrey C.R. Stierhof Y.D. Ruppel A. Steverding D. Exp. Parasitol. 1999; 91: 327-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) showed that a peptide diazomethane inhibitor was lethal to T. brucei in culture and produced swelling of the endosome/lysosome compartment of T. brucei. The presumptive target of this inhibitor was rhodesain, the major proteolytic activity and cathepsin L-like protease of the parasite. We have identified a cathepsin B-like homologue, tbcatB, in the T. brucei genome that confirms the Clan CA cysteine protease repertoire of T. brucei is more complex than previously thought. The tbcatB transcript is similar in size to the rhodesain transcript, but the amount of the message and protease is relatively low in comparison with the amount of rhodesain message and protein. This may explain why tbcatB was not identified in previous studies where synthetic peptides were used to characterize protease activities in T. brucei. Whereas rhodesain mRNA was expressed at equivalent levels in both digenic stages of T. brucei, the mRNA of tbcatB was differentially up-regulated in the bloodstream-form parasites. Previous studies examining the expression of cathepsin-B and l-like cysteine proteases in related kinetoplastids showed that the mRNA for the cathepsin L-like protease in Leishmania species was up-regulated in the intracellular amastigote stage, but the mRNA for the cathepsin B-like cysteine protease was equivalently expressed in the promastigote and amastigote stages (33Sakanari J.A. Nadler S.A. Chan V.J. Engel J.C. Leptak C. Bouvier J. Exp. Parasitol. 1997; 85: 63-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 34Bart G. Coombs G.H. Mottram J.C. Mol. Biochem.

Chem. 2002; 277: 25305-25312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In T. cruzi, the mRNAs for cathepsin L and cathepsin B-like proteases are both up-regulated in the bloodstream trypomastigote stage (36Eakin A. Mills A. Harth G. McKerrow J. Craik C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7411-7420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Nobrega O.T. Santos Silva M.A. Teixeira A.R.L. Santana J.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 97: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, as shown here for T. brucei, the cathepsin L-like protease of T. cruzi represents the most abundant cysteine protease activity and is post-transcriptionally up-regulated in the intracellular amastigote stage. Because both proteases are expressed in the bloodstream form of T. brucei, it is conceivable that they represent a redundant system of host-protein degradation. The observation that T. brucei bloodstream forms degrade host proteins in an unusual endosome/lysosome compartment was thought to differ from the intracellular protein degradation classically attributed to the Clan CA family proteases of mammalian and plant cells. Recently, similar phenomena have been observed in mammalian systems where extracellular proteins were degraded by cathepsins either exocytosed from lysosomal compartments (38Mai J. Sameni M. Mikkelsen T. Sloane B.F. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 1407-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) or released through a regulated secretory pathway (13Linke M. Herzog V. Brix K. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4877-4889Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that the Clan CA cysteine protease family evolved very early to carry out a broad array of biologic functions in primitive eukaryotic cells, some of which have been retained by higher eukaryotes. The differential regulation of tbcatB and rhodesain suggests that these two proteases may have distinct biological roles. To address this issue in T. brucei, we utilized RNA interference to selectively knock down rhodesain or tbcatB activity in T. brucei. In cultured bloodstream trypanosomes, no observable phenotype was found after nearly complete knockdown of rhodesain message, protein, and proteolytic activity. In contrast, induction of RNAi in the pZJMTbCB clones produced a modest 32% reduction in protein and protease activity but led to a distinctive dysmorphic phenotype. Dilation of the anterior end and a block in cytokinesis of the tbcatB knockdown parasites produced a tadpole-like morphology with an enlarged lysosome/endosome compartment. These parasites were able to complete multiple rounds of genomic replication and mitosis as evidenced by the appearance of multiple kinetoplasts and nuclei but were not able to complete cytokinesis. This defect in cytokinesis is reminiscent of that seen and reported for α-tubulin-depleted parasites (14Ngo H. Tschudi C. Gull K. Ullu E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14687-14692Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). It is possible that tbcatB could also be involved in a microtubule-related event alternatively; lack of cytokinesis may be an indirect consequence of iron depletion because of the inability of the parasite to degrade transferrin. The fact that a dysmorphic and later lethal phenotype was observed with modest reduction in the total protease suggests that this enzyme may be slowly replenished or be at a critical steady-state concentration in the parasites. Finally, the lethal tbcatB RNAi effect associated with inhibition of FITC-transferrin degradation recapitulated the phenotype seen with parasites exposed to a peptide diazomethane cysteine protease inhibitor. This suggests that tbcatB was the most probable target of that inhibitor and plays a major role in host serum protein degradation by the parasite. T. brucei is the causative agent of African sleeping sickness, a major health problem in sub-Saharan Africa and one of the great neglected diseases. Identification of a specific enzyme required for the viability of bloodstream trypanosomes represents an exploitable target for the development of new chemotherapy. We thank C. Caffrey for anti-rhodesain antibodies, George Cross for the 90-13 T. brucei strain, Paul Englund for the pZJM vector, and Matt Bogyo for active site probes."

https://openalex.org/W2147339154,"Diabetic nephropathy affects 30–40% of diabetics leading to end-stage kidney failure through progressive scarring and fibrosis. Previous evidence suggests that tissue transglutaminase (tTg) and its protein cross-link product ϵ(γ-glutamyl)lysine contribute to the expanding renal tubulointerstitial and glomerular basement membranes in this disease. Using an in vitro cell culture model of renal proximal tubular epithelial cells we determined the link between elevated glucose levels with changes in expression and activity of tTg and then, by using a highly specific site directed inhibitor of tTg (1,3-dimethyl-2[(oxopropyl)thio]imidazolium), determined the contribution of tTg to glucose-induced matrix accumulation. Exposure of cells to 36 mm glucose over 96 h caused an mRNA-dependent increase in tTg activity with a 25% increase in extracellular matrix (ECM)-associated tTg and a 150% increase in ECM ϵ(γ-glutamyl)lysine cross-linking. This was paralleled by an elevation in total deposited ECM resulting from higher levels of deposited collagen and fibronectin. These were associated with raised mRNA for collagens III, IV, and fibronectin. The specific site-directed inhibitor of tTg normalized both tTg activity and ECM-associated ϵ(γ-glutamyl)lysine. Levels of ECM per cell returned to near control levels with non-transcriptional reductions in deposited collagen and fibronectin. No changes in transforming growth factor β1 (expression or biological activity) occurred that could account for our observations, whereas incubation of tTg with collagen III indicated that cross-linking could directly increase the rate of collagen fibril/gel formation. We conclude that Tg inhibition reduces glucose-induced deposition of ECM proteins independently of changes in ECM and transforming growth factor β1 synthesis thus opening up its possible application in the treatment other fibrotic and scarring diseases where tTg has been implicated. Diabetic nephropathy affects 30–40% of diabetics leading to end-stage kidney failure through progressive scarring and fibrosis. Previous evidence suggests that tissue transglutaminase (tTg) and its protein cross-link product ϵ(γ-glutamyl)lysine contribute to the expanding renal tubulointerstitial and glomerular basement membranes in this disease.

It is characterized by an early thickening of tubular and glomerular basement membranes due to an excessive accumulation of the extracellular matrix and ultimately leads to progressive scarring and fibrosis of the kidney (1Amos A.F. McCarty D.J. Zimmet P. Diabet. Med. 1997; 14: S1-S85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Chiarelli F. Trotta D. Verrotti A. Mohn A. Panminerva. Med. 2003; 45: 23-41PubMed Google Scholar, 3Gilbert R.E. Cooper M.E. Kidney Int. 1999; 56: 1627-1637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). It also causes a significant increase in the cardiovascular morbidity and mortality of diabetic patients. The incidence of diabetes and diabetic nephropathy continues to rise worldwide. It is predicted that the number of people with diabetes will continue to increase, reaching 221 million by 2010 (1Amos A.F. McCarty D.J. Zimmet P. Diabet. Med. 1997; 14: S1-S85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Clinically, DN manifests itself by the onset of continuous microalbuminuria followed by the appearance of persistent proteinuria (2Chiarelli F. Trotta D. Verrotti A. Mohn A. Panminerva. Med. 2003; 45: 23-41PubMed Google Scholar). This is followed by a progressive decline in glomerular filtration rate ultimately leading to end-stage renal failure. Although DN was traditionally considered to be primarily a glomerular disease, it is now widely accepted that the rate of deterioration of kidney function correlates best with the degree of tubulointerstitial fibrosis (3Gilbert R.E. Cooper M.E. Kidney Int. 1999; 56: 1627-1637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Consequently, increased research has focused on the role of the tubular epithelial cells, in particular the proximal tubular epithelial cells, in the initiation of fibrosis. In a recent study using the rat streptozotocin-induced hyperglycemic model of diabetes, we demonstrated elevated levels of the protein cross-linking enzyme tissue transglutaminase (tTg) in the peritubular interstitial space. This change in enzyme distribution was paralleled by an increase in the ϵ(γ-glutamyl)-lysine protein cross-link (4Skill N.J. Griffin M. El Nahas A.M. Sanai T. Haylor J.L. Fisher M. Jamie M.F. Mould N.N. Johnson T.S. Lab. Invest. 2001; 81: 705-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We have shown similar changes in fibrotic/scarred human kidney biopsy material (5Johnson T.S. El-Koraie A.F. Skill N.J. Baddour N.M. El Nahas A.M. Njloma M. Adam A.G. Griffin M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2003; 14: 2052-2062Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and in the rat remnant kidney model of renal scarring (6Johnson T.S. Griffin M. Thomas G.L. Skill J. Cox A. Yang B. Nicholas B.

Thomas G.L. Douthwaite J.A. Haylor J.L. Griffin M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 2146-2157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In all cases the up-regulation of tTg and its product correlated significantly with increased interstitial fibrosis and scarring. In both animal and human tissues, we demonstrated tubular epithelial cells to be the major source of tTg. Tissue transglutaminase belongs to a group of calcium-dependent mammalian enzymes that have the capacity to irreversibly cross-link proteins through the formation of ϵ(γ-glutamyl)lysine bonds (8Griffin M. Casadio R. Bergamini C. Biochem. J. Rev. 2002; 368: 377-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). In addition to the potential role in kidney scarring, elevated levels of tTg have been associated with a number of other fibrotic diseases, including lung, liver, and heart (9Griffin M. Smith L.L. Wynne J. Br. J. Exp. Pathol. 1979; 60: 653-661PubMed Google Scholar, 10Small K. Feng J.F. Lorenz J. Donnelly E.T. Yu A. Im M.J. Dorn 2nd, G.W. Liggett S.B. J. Biol.

Invest. Dermatol. 2003; 121: 412-423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 13Kleman J.P. Aeschlimann D. Paulsson M. van der Rest M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13768-13775Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) as well as their increased resistance to the action of matrix metalloproteinases (7Johnson T.S. Skill N.J. El Nahas A.M. Oldroyd S.D. Thomas G.L. Douthwaite J.A. Haylor J.L. Griffin M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 2146-2157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to this proposed direct effect of tTg on matrix accumulation, the enzyme has also been implicated in the matrix storage and subsequent activation of the fibrogenic cytokine, transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1), through the cross-linking of the latent TGFβ1-binding protein (LTBP-1) to the ECM (14Nunes I. Gleizes P.E. Metz C.N. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1151-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) thus facilitating its activation. Given these potential direct and indirect contributions of tTg to the pathogenesis of DN and the epidemiological evidence, which indicates that the complications of diabetes are related to poor glycemic control (2Chiarelli F. Trotta D. Verrotti A. Mohn A. Panminerva. Med. 2003; 45: 23-41PubMed Google Scholar, 15Gaster B. Hirsch I.B. Arch. Intern. Med. 1998; 158: 134-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), it was important to demonstrate a molecular link between elevated glucose levels and changes in the expression and action of tissue transglutaminase. To date, changes in tTg in relation to elevated glucose conditions have only been observed in the pancreatic β cell (16Bungay P.J. Owen R.A. Coutts I.C. Griffin M. Biochem. J. 1986; 235: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The aim of the current study is to investigate the effects of high glucose levels on tTg expression and activity in the well characterized opossum proximal tubular epithelial cell line (OK cells) (17Gstraunthaler G. Seppi T. Pfaller W. Zhang S.L. Filep J.G. Hohman T.C. Tang S.S. Ingelfinger J.R. Chan J.S. Tam V.K. Clemens T.L. Green J. Cell Physiol.

Initial studies were aimed at examining the regulation of tTg expression in response to elevated glucose concentrations, whereas subsequent studies examined how changes in tTg could affect ECM deposition. We demonstrate that elevated glucose concentrations stimulate de novo synthesis of tTg, which is paralleled by an increase in the expression of the ECM proteins fibronectin, collagen III, and collagen IV, with a subsequent increase in the deposition of total collagen and fibronectin. In the time frame of our experiments (96 h) we observed no changes in the expression or presence of TGFβ1. We demonstrate, for the first time, that the observed increase in the deposition of fibronectin, collagen, and other matrix proteins induced by elevated glucose conditions can be directly linked to their covalent cross-linking via ϵ(γ-glutamyl)lysine bridges. Experimental Protocol and Conditions—Opossum kidney proximal tubular epithelial cells (OK PTCs) (European collection of cell cultures, Cambridge, UK) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 6 mm d-glucose (glucose-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies) plus 1.1g/liter d-glucose), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 20 mm glutamine, and 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum in a humidified atmosphere at 5% (v/v) CO2. For experimentation, 6 mm d-glucose was considered equivalent to normal glycemic conditions. Glucose concentrations between 12 and 36 mm were considered to represent the clinical hyperglycemic environment. To achieve this, media was further supplemented with d-glucose to the required concentration with a parallel flask containing an equivalent concentration of l-glucose to control for osmolarity. All experiments were carried out over a 96-h period with the alteration to glucose at the time of plating. To ensure that glucose differentials were maintained throughout the experimental time period, media was assayed for glucose daily using a glucose analyzer (Analox P-GM7 Micro-Stat) and glucose added to compensate for cell usage. For Tg inhibition studies, two highly specific active site-directed, irreversible inhibitors were used. One, 1,3-dimethyl-2[(oxopropyl)thio]-imidazolium (20Fround K.F. Doshi K. Gaul S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10109-10119Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 21.Syntex (March, 1990) U. S. Patent 4,912,120Google Scholar) was termed compound NTU283. The other, a carboxybenzoyl-glutamylglycine analogue, was termed compound NTU281. 2Patent application number GB0314262.7, June 2003. Both compounds were synthesized in-house. The inhibitor NTU283 was added to 36 mm d-glucose culture media at the time of plating to a final concentration of 33, 66, or 99 μm. The inhibitor NTU281 was used in the collagen fibrillogenesis assays at a concentration of 250 μm. Cell Number, Protein, DNA, and Viability Determination—Protein concentrations were determined using protocols based on the Lowry and the bicinchoninic acid assays. DNA was determined using the Burton assay (diphenylamine). Viable cell numbers were measured by the counting of cells using the trypan blue exclusion method. Cell viability/cell leakage was also determined by measuring leakage of lactate dehydrogenase into the cell culture medium (Cytotox 96 viability assay kit, Promega, Southampton, UK). Quantitation of Transglutaminase—Unless specified, cells were removed with 2 mg/ml trypsin-2 mm EDTA then centrifuged at 300 × g for 5 min, and the resultant pellet was washed in PBS. Cells were resuspended in 250 μl of STE buffer (0.32 m sucrose, 5 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA) containing protease inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm), benzamidine (5 mm), and leupeptin (10 μg/ml) and homogenized on ice. For extracellular Tg, the media was collected and cells were removed by centrifugation. The media was freeze-dried and re-suspended in 1/10 volume of STE buffer with protease inhibitors prior to analysis for activity and tTg antigen (12Gross S.R. Balklava Z. Griffin M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2003; 121: 412-423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Transglutaminase Activity—Transglutaminase activity was determined by the Ca2+-dependent incorporation of [1,4-14C]putrescine (Amersham Biosciences) into N,N′-dimethylcasein as previously described (6Johnson T.S. Griffin M. Thomas G.L. Skill J. Cox A. Yang B. Nicholas B. Birckbichler P.J. Muchaneta-Kubara C. Meguid El Nahas A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2950-2960Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Results were corrected to units/mg of protein (1 unit equals 1 nmol of putrescine incorporated per hour at 37 °C). tTg Western Blotting—Proteins were separated on a 10% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel and then electroblotted onto Hybond ECL (Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was blocked with 3% nonfat dried milk, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 in PBS (milk-Tween-PBS) and then immunoprobed with 0.2 μg/ml of a anti-tTg monoclonal antibody (CUB7402, Stratek Scientific, Luton, UK) at 4 °C overnight. Primary antibody binding was revealed with 1.5 μg/ml goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody (Dako, UK) for 1 h at room temperature and visualized using ECL chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Films were quantified by volume densitometry using a Bio-Rad GS-690 imaging densitometer and molecular analyst version 4 software (Bio-Rad). tTg ELISA—Ninety-six-well plates were coated with 100 μl of 5 μg/ml fibronectin overnight at 4 °C and blocked as above. Cell homogenates or concentrated culture media (50 μl) were incubated in triplicate for 2 h at room temperature and then washed with milk-Tween-PBS. Wells were then immunoprobed for tTg with 100 μl of 0.2 μg/ml of anti-tTg monoclonal antibody CUB7402 overnight at 4 °C and revealed with 100 μl of 1.5 μg/ml goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody for 2 h at room temperature using a TMB (3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine) substrate. 50 μl of 2.5 m H2SO4 was used to stop the reaction, and the absorbance was read at 450 nm. Immunolocalization of tTg—OK cells were seeded and cultured in 8-well plastic chamber slides (Lab Tech, Scientific Laboratory Supplies, Nottingham, UK), incubated for 96 h under experimental conditions and immunoprobed for tTg, as previously described (22Verderio E. Gaudry C. Gross S. Smith C. Downes S. Griffin M. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1999; 47: 1417-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) using 0.6 μg/ml of anti-tTg monoclonal antibody CUB7042 overnight at 4 °C. Binding was revealed using 3 μg/ml goat anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated to fluorescein and visualized using a Leica TCS-NT confocal laser microscope with excitation at 488 nm and the emissions recorded at 530 nm. Extracellular Matrix Analysis—For ϵ-(γ-glutamyl)lysine and hydroxyproline analysis, OK cells were grown in 10-cm Petri dishes and solubilized with 1 ml of 0.1% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate-2 mm EDTA (DOC-EDTA). The DOC-EDTA-soluble fraction was kept for protein analysis (BCA assay) while the insoluble residue, remaining on the plate and predominantly representing the ECM, was partially digested with 0.2 mg/ml trypsin/1 mm EDTA and then scraped off. The fraction was then freeze-dried. For tTg and fibronectin analysis, cells were seeded in 96-well plates, and the DOC-EDTA-insoluble fraction was immunoprobed directly on the plate. ϵ-(γ-Glutamyl)lysine Levels—Freeze-dried proteins were suspended in 0.1 m ammonium carbonate and subjected to exhaustive proteolysis as previously described (23Griffin M. Wilson J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1984; 58: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Digests were freeze-dried again and resuspended in 0.1 n HCl. ϵ-(γ-glutamyl)lysine was analyzed by cation exchange chromatography using an LKB 4151 amino acid analyzer (Amersham Biosciences) using a modification of a lithium citrate buffer method with an Ultrapac 8 cation exchange resin (8 ± 0.5-μm particle size (23Griffin M. Wilson J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1984; 58: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar)). The detection of amino acids and peptides was undertaken by a post column reaction with 600 mg/liter o-phthalaldehyde/5 ml/liter 2-mercaptoethanol, and the fluorescence was observed at 450 nm after excitation at 360 nm using an LS1 detector (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with analysis of chromatograms by a Nelson 9000 A-D integrator and software (Nelson Analytical). The amount of ϵ-(γ-glutamyl)lysine in each sample was quantified by standard addition of 1 nmol of ϵ-(γ-glutamyl)lysine dipeptide. Quantitation of Hydroxyproline—DOC-EDTA-insoluble proteins were acid-hydrolyzed in 6 n HCl overnight at 110 °C in an oxygen-free environment. After freeze drying and re-suspending in H2O the hydrolysates were assayed for hydroxyproline by derivatization with 7-chloro-4-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole and separation by reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatography (Beckman Instruments, High Wycombe, UK) (24Campa J.S. McAnulty R.J. Laurent G.J. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 186: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Quantification was by absorption at 495 nm and peak integration as above. Extracellular Fibronectin and tTg—DOC-EDTA-insoluble proteins were blocked with milk-Tween-PBS before the addition of either 0.2 μg/ml of the monoclonal anti-tTg antibody CUB7042 or a 1:1000 dilution of rabbit anti-fibronectin (clone IST-1, Sigma) at 4 °C overnight (22Verderio E. Gaudry C. Gross S. Smith C. Downes S. Griffin M. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1999; 47: 1417-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Primary antibody was revealed with 1.5 μg/ml goat anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase or goat anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugates before the application of 70 μg/ml TMB in phosphatecitrate urea hydrogen peroxide buffer. The reaction was stopped with 2.5 m sulfuric acid, and the absorbance was read at 450 nm. Measurement of ECM Collagen by 3H Proline Labeling—Cells were seeded in 10-cm Petri dishes at a density of 3.75 × 106 per dish. Deposited collagens were labeled by the addition of 20 μl of [2,3-3H]proline (1.0 mCi/ml, ICN) at the time of plating. After 96 h the media was removed, and cells were washed with PBS. Cells were then removed with 2 ml of 0.25 m ammonium hydroxide in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, at 37 °C for 10 min. The soluble fraction was collected, and protein concentration was determined using the BCA assay. The dishes were washed extensively with increasing volumes of PBS before the ECM was solubilized with 2 ml of 2.5% (w/v) SDS in 50 mm Tris, pH 6.8. The dish was then scraped to ensure complete removal of the ECM, and 200 μl was measured for radioactivity in a scintillation counter. Collagen Fibrillogenesis Assay—Collagen fibrillogenesis was monitored using a spectrophotometric method (25Nomura Y. Takahashi K. Shirai K. Wada K. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1989; 53: 1614-1620Google Scholar). Type III collagen (Sigma C3511) was solubilized in 0.2 m acetic acid at a concentration of 5 mg/ml at 4 °C with constant stirring for 24 h. Initiation of fibrillogenesis was by neutralization of the collagen mixture by the addition of 10× Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 0.2 m HEPES buffer to final concentrations of 1× and 0.02 m, respectively. Addition of CaCl2 to 5 mm and dithiothreitol to 5 mm was made immediately after neutralization and before addition of guinea pig liver tissue transglutaminase (Sigma T5398, ∼1000 units/mg). Fibril formation after neutralization was monitored by measuring absorbance at 325 nm using a PYE Unicam SP1800 UV spectrophotometer. mRNA Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from at least 5 × 106 cells using TRIzol™ (Invitrogen) and quantitated by optical density at 260 nm. 15 μg of total RNA was then run on a 1.2% (w/v) agarose/MOPS/formaldehyde gel and then capillary blotted on to Nylon+ (Roche Applied Science) and cross-linked with 70 mJ/cm2 UV radiation (UV cross-linker, Amersham Biosciences). This was then probed with [α-32P]dCTP random primed labeled (Prime a gene, Promega, UK), sequence-specific DNA probes for tTg (7Johnson T.S. Skill N.J. El Nahas A.M. Oldroyd S.D. Thomas G.L.

Development. 1991; 111: 131-143PubMed Google Scholar) before exposure to BioMax MS film. The resulting autoradiographs were then quantified by scanning densitometry using a Bio-Rad GS-690 densitometer and Molecular Analyst version 4 software. Transcript size was determined by comparison to RNA molecular weight markers (Promega, UK) using the same analysis package. Values were then corrected for loading using repeat probings with GAPDH. Detection of Active TGFβ—Active and total TGFβ (heat-activated) was determined using the mink lung epithelial cell assay whereby mink lung epithelial cells are stably transfected with a construct consisting of the TGFβ1 promoter region of plasmin activator inhibitor ligated to the luciferase reporter construct (30Abe M. Harpel J.G. Metz C.N. Nunes I. Loskutoff D.J. Rifkin D.B. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 216: 276-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). Media (serum-free) from OK cells grown under increased glucose concentrations was collected and applied to mink lung epithelial cells overnight. The media was then removed, and the cells were lysed and assayed for luciferase activity using a luciferase assay kit (Promega) and luminometer (Anthos Lab Tec Instruments, Salzberg, Austria), as per the manufacturer's instructions. Commercially available TGFβ1 was used as a positive control. Collagen Secretion—Cells were grown for 96 h with [2,3-3H]proline (Amersham Biosciences) added to the culture media at a final concentration of 75 kBq/ml. To determine the total amount of [2,3-3H]proline-labeled proteins present in the media, 25 μl of media was precipitated onto 3MM filter paper using ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid, washed three times in 5% trichloroacetic acid and twice in ethanol before counting in a scintillation counter. To determine the collagen component of this, a parallel sample of media was digested with 30 units/ml of chromatography-purified (i.e. free of proteases and clostripain) bacterial collagenase (Sigma) for 15 min at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.2 m NaCl before precipitation with trichloroacetic acid. The overall amount of collagen-labeled material in the media was calculated by subtracting the counts following collagenase digestion from the total labeled protein. Fluorography of Secreted Collagens—Media from cells grown in 75 kBq/ml labeled proline (Amersham Biosciences) for 96 h was precipitated using 4 volumes of acetone, washed 3×, and then resuspended in 1% (w/v) SDS, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA. 50 μl of protein was then separated on 10% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels using an interrupted SDS-PAGE (31Sykes B.

The gel was then dried under vacuum at 80 °C and exposed to BioMax MS film at –70 °C for 4 weeks. Data Analysis—All data are shown as means ± S.E. Experimental groups were compared using Student's t test with unequal variance. p < 0.05 was taken as statistically significant. Effect of High Glucose on Cell Proliferation and Viability— Increasing the concentration of glucose from 6 to 36 mm in the culture media of OK PTCs over a 96-h period caused a dose-dependent increase in viable cell numbers with no significant changes observed in cell leakage (lactate dehydrogenase ratio) and cell viability (Trypan Blue) (Table I).Table IEffect of high glucose on cell proliferation and viabilityExtracellular d-glucoseCell numberTotal proteinTotal DNAIntracellular d-glucoseLDH ratioTrypan blue stainingmm× 106mg/plateμg/plateμm%61.45 ± 0.150.23 ± 0.0618.2 ± 1.30.87 ± 0.1896.6 ± 0.495.4 ± 2.17241.59 ± 0.17ap < 0.050.34 ± 0.08ap < 0.0519.9 ± 0.71.36 ± 0.1997.3 ± 0.896.6 ± 1.3361.83 ± 0.30ap < 0.050.38 ± 0.1ap < 0.0522.9 ± 2.3ap < 0.051.79 ± 0.1997.4 ± 0.794.6 ± 2.8a p < 0.05 Open table in a new tab Effect of High Glucose on Transglutaminase—Increasing the media concentration of glucose caused a dose-dependent increase in the cellular activity of Tg in OK cells (Fig. 1a). This was shown to be due to increases in tTg protein measured by both ELISA (Fig. 1b) and Western blotting (Fig. 1c), which was mRNA-dependent (Fig. 1d). Immunoprobing of cells for tTg showed that large increases in antigen were localized to cell clusters (Fig. 1e). Measurement of Tg activity and tTg antigen in the culture media demonstrated that changes in intracellular tTg were carried through to the extracellular environment with Tg activity increasing from 1.65 ± 0.21 to 2.5 ± 0.27 units/106 cells and tTg antigen from 1.51 ± 0.07 to 3.3 ± 0.41 ng/106 cells as glucose concentration was increased from 6 to 36 mm, respectively. Effects of High Glucose on the Extracellular Matrix—Following the removal of cells using a deoxycholate-EDTA solution (DOC-EDTA), the remaining extracellular proteins (i.e. ECM) increased in response to glucose from 1.1 ± 0.1 mg/107 cells at 6 mm glucose to 2.5 ± 0.2 mg/107 cells at 36 mm glucose (Fig. 2a). Analysis of fibronectin (Fig. 2b) and total collagen (hydroxyproline) (Fig. 2c) showed that both these proteins were in part responsible for increased levels of ECM proteins. Northern blot analysis indicated that these increases were mRNA-dependent with specific changes in fibronectin, collagen I and IV mRNA levels (Fig. 2, d–f). There was no measurable change in TGFβ1 mRNA or active TGFβ1 present in the cell culture medium (data not shown) suggesting these i"

Several components have now been identified that control both the intracellular localization as well as activity of the Rtg1p·Rtg3p complex, yet the precise upstream regulatory signals involved remain unclear. For example, it has been proposed that Rtg1p·Rtg3p activity is repressed by glutamate, acting through the mitochondrial retrograde response pathway or, alternatively, by glutamine, acting through the Tor kinase pathway. Here we demonstrate that RTG target gene regulation is remarkably complex, with glutamate and glutamine as well as ammonia collaborating as potentially distinct signals to regulate RTG target gene expression. We show that both Tor and these nutrient-based signals converge on Mks1p, the immediate upstream inhibitor of Rtg1p·Rtg3p, and that a direct correlation exists between the degree of Mks1p phosphorylation and the extent of RTG target gene repression. Finally, we find that Tor- and glutamine-mediated RTG-target gene repression can be experimentally uncoupled, indicating that glutamine and Tor act, at least in part, independently to inhibit this pathway.

Normal cell proliferation requires that cells adjust their protein biosynthetic and metabolic activity in response to nutrient availability and other environmental cues. Specific signaling pathways exist that enable cells to perceive and respond appropriately to these cues, and distinct pathogenic states are often contingent upon impaired regulation of these pathways (1Vogt P.K.

Accordingly, a detailed understanding of how these pathways function is likely to be important for improved treatment of many human diseases, including cancer. One signaling pathway utilized by cells to control their growth in response to nutritional signals is the Tor (Target of rapamycin) kinase pathway. This pathway was discovered through the action of the antibiotic rapamycin, which inhibits the activity of many rapidly proliferating cells and, because of this, is presently in clinical use as an anti-proliferative agent as well as in trials as a potential anti-cancer tool (1Vogt P.K.

Treating yeast cells with rapamycin induces several responses that bear similarity to nutrient starvation, including a reduction in protein synthesis and ribosome biogenesis, cell cycle arrest, and ultimately, entry into G0 (4Schmelzle T.

Remarkably, despite the importance of Tor as a regulator of cell growth and an important target for therapy, we still know very little about the physiologically relevant signals that control this pathway. Recent studies demonstrate that Tor regulates the expression of many cell growth-related genes in yeast, including genes involved in carbon and nitrogen metabolism (10Beck T. Hall M.N.

In particular, we and others show that Tor negatively regulates a concise cluster of genes, termed RTG target genes, which encode a variety of enzymes involved in the anaplerotic production of α-ketoglutarate for use in de novo biosynthesis of glutamate and glutamine (13Komeili A. Wedaman K.P. O'Shea E.O. Powers T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 863-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 14Shamji A.F. Kuruvilla F.G. Schreiber S.L. Curr.

RTG target genes include enzymes involved in the tricarboxylic acid and glyoxylate cycles, for example peroxisomal citrate synthase 2 (CIT2), and are positively regulated by a heterodimeric transcription factor complex composed of the bHLH/Zip proteins Rtg1p and Rtg3p (15Liao X.

In response to impaired mitochondrial function, as occurs in rho0 petite cells that lack mitochondrial DNA or after rapamycin treatment of cells grown under rich nutrient conditions, the Rtg1p and Rtg3p proteins translocate from the cytoplasm into the nucleus and activate their target genes (13Komeili A.

Several proteins have been identified that are important for this regulated nucleocytoplasmic trafficking event, including two cytoplasmic proteins, Rtg2p (13Komeili A. Wedaman K.P. O'Shea E.O.

Results of several studies indicate that Mks1p is an inhibitor of the Rtg1p·Rtg3p complex and that Rtg2p in turn acts to inhibit Mks1p (20Sekito T. Liu Z. Thornton J. Butow R.A. Mol. Biol.

Indeed, dynamic interactions between Rtg2p and Mks1p as well as between Mks1p and Bmh1p and Bmh2p, the latter being the yeast homologues of mammalian 14-3-3 proteins, play critical roles in regulating the localization and activity of the Rtg1p·Rtg3p complex (23Liu Z. Sekito T. S'pirek M. Thornton J. Butow R.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 410-411Google Scholar). An important focal point within this regulatory scheme is the phosphorylation state of Mks1p, which is responsive both to mitochondrial dysfunction as well as rapamycin treatment (20Sekito T. Liu Z. Thornton J. Butow R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 795-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 21Dilova I. Chen C.-Y. Powers T. Curr.

An outstanding question that remains is the nature of metabolic signals that regulate RTG target gene expression. Butow and Liu provide evidence that glutamate is important as a repressive signal for the pathway (17Liu Z. Butow R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6720-6728Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). This repression appears to involve, at least in part, the SPS amino acid sensor system (24Forsberg H. Ljungdahl P.O. Curr. Genet. 2001; 40: 91-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), which includes the amino acid permease-like protein Ssy1p and its partner proteins Ptr3p and Shr3p (25Liu Z. Sekito T. Epstein C.B. Butow R.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7209-7219Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). By contrast, in collaboration with Hall and co-workers (26Crespo J.L. Powers T. Fowler B. Hall M.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6784-6789Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), we have provided evidence that glutamine production is important for RTG target gene repression. Indeed, because of the correlation between the effects of glutamine starvation and rapamycin treatment, we suggested that glutamine is likely to act upstream of Tor within this pathway (26Crespo J.L. Powers T. Fowler B. Hall M.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6784-6789Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Finally, Cooper and co-workers reported that providing proline as a sole source of nitrogen is also repressive for this pathway, but in a manner that is insensitive to rapamycin, suggesting the existence of a Tor-independent mode for RTG target gene repression. Here we have investigated further the role of these different putative repressive nutritional signals. We find that the role of proline can be attributed to its conversion to glutamate and that rapamycin-sensitive RTG target gene repression requires the availability of ammonia and/or glutamine. Importantly, we confirm a role for glutamine as a bona fide repressive signal for the pathway. However, our present results suggest that glutamine likely acts in concert with, rather than uniquely upstream of Tor. We find that all metabolic signals converge on Mks1p to influence its phosphorylation state and, ultimately, regulate the intracellular localization and activity of the Rtg1p·Rtg3p complex.

Cell. 1999; 10: 987-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). 50 ml of cells were grown to mid-logarithmic phase (A600 = 0.5) and concentrated by centrifugation, and total RNA extraction was performed using a hot phenol method employing phase-lock tubes (Eppendorf). 20 μg of total RNA was loaded onto a 1.5% agarose, 6.9% formaldehyde gel and run in 1× E buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 5 mm sodium acetate, 0.5 mm EDTA). The RNA was transferred overnight to Duralon-UV membrane (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and probed overnight at 65 °C in Church hybridization buffer (0.5 m NaPO4, pH 7.2, 7% SDS, 1 mm EDTA). Membranes were washed in 2× sodium saline citrate (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate) buffer, exposed to a phosphorimaging screen, and analyzed using a STORM 860 imaging system and software provided by the manufacturer software (Amersham Biosciences). DNA templates for the Northern probes were made as described previously (13Komeili A. Wedaman K.P. O'Shea E.O. Powers T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 863-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 30Powers T. Walter P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 987-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Relative levels of expression of mRNAs were normalized to actin mRNA (ACT1). Western Blot Analysis—10 ml of cells were grown to mid-logarithmic phase (A600 = 0.5) and harvested by centrifugation, and total protein extraction was performed using a NaOH extraction procedure (19Sekito T. Thorton J. Butow R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2103-2115Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed in 0.255 m NaOH, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, and proteins were precipitated by treatment with trichloroacetic acid at a final concentration of 6.1%. The protein pellet was then washed with 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, and resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (65 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 0.002% bromphenol blue). Proteins were resolved on 7.5% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Protran, Intermountain Scientific). Membranes were probed using monoclonal anti-hemagglutinin (HA) antibody (HA.11; Covance) and visualized by chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Gene Expression Analysis Using cDNA Microarrays—For experiments presented in Fig. 2, 1-liter cultures each of strains S288c, Σ1278b, and Σ2000 (MY1384) were grown with vigorous shaking to 0.5 A600/ml in MD-Gln or MD-Glu. Cultures were then divided, and rapamycin was added to a final concentration of 0.2 μg/ml to half of each culture. After incubation for 30 min, cells were harvested, poly(A) mRNA was isolated, and microarray analysis was carried out essentially as described (13Komeili A. Wedaman K.P. O'Shea E.O. Powers T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 863-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Shown in Fig. 2 is a comparison of rapamycin-treated samples for each strain, where poly(A) mRNA isolated from cells grown in MD-Gln was used in the preparation of Cy5-labeled cDNA, and poly(A) mRNA isolated from cells grown in MD-Glu was used in the preparation of Cy3-labeled cDNA. The ratio of Cy5/Cy3 for known RTG target genes was then plotted using Excel software (Microsoft). For comparison, similar Cy5- and Cy3-labeled cDNAs were prepared from all three strains grown in MD-Gln and MD-Glu, respectively, but that were not treated with rapamycin. For this latter comparison, only results from strain S288c are shown in Fig. 2; however, similar results were obtained from all three strains. In addition, similar results were obtained in two independent experiments for each strain examined. Fluorescence Microscopy—Strain EYO733 was freshly transformed with plasmid pRTG1-GFP (13Komeili A. Wedaman K.P. O'Shea E.O. Powers T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 863-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) and grown overnight in MD-Gln media that lacked uracil to select for plasmid maintenance. Media also contained 0.006% adenine, 0.008% leucine, 0.006% histidine, and 0.005% tryptophan to supplement the auxotrophic requirements of this strain. Cells were then washed and then diluted to 0.005 A600/ml in MD-Gln or MD-Glu media containing the auxotrophic supplements listed above. Cells were then grown to 0.3 A600/ml, cultures were divided into two, and rapamycin or drug vehicle alone (Me2SO) was added to each sample. Cells were examined 10 min later by fluorescence microscopy using a Nikkon Eclipse E600 microscope equipped with a 100× oil immersion objective. Images were recorded with a CCD camera (Hamamatsu) using an exposure time of 2 s. Image analysis was performed using Open Lab software (Improvision, Boston, MA). Measurement of Intracellular Ammonia—Intracellular NH4+ was measured essentially as described (31Chen E.J. Kiaser C.A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 1-15Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Briefly, three A600 of yeast cells were filtered, washed twice with distilled water, and resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold methanol. The cell suspension was dried in a Speed-Vac with no heat and stored at –80 °C. Pellets were resuspended in 450 μl of distilled water by vortexing for 5 min followed by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm at 4 °C. Supernatants were filtered through a 0.2-μm syringe filter and submitted to the University of California Davis Molecular Structure Facility for analysis, where a Beckman 6300 amino acid analyzer employing a lithium citrate buffer system was used. Characterization of Rapamycin-insensitive RTG Target Gene Repression—We were intrigued by the finding reported by Tate et al. (22Tate J.J. Cox K.H. Rai R. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20477-20482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) that the RTG target gene CIT2 remains repressed when Tor is inactivated by rapamycin in cells utilizing proline as a sole nitrogen source. This is in contrast to cells grown in glutamine, where RTG target genes are also repressed yet become induced by rapamycin treatment (13Komeili A. Wedaman K.P. O'Shea E.O. Powers T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 863-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 21Dilova I. Chen C.-Y. Powers T. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 389-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 26Crespo J.L. Powers T. Fowler B. Hall M.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6784-6789Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Because proline is catabolized to glutamate within mitochondria (32Stryer L. Biochemistry. 4th Ed. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1995: 505Google Scholar), it was suggested that glutamate is likely to be the rapamycin-insensitive repressive signal (22Tate J.J. Cox K.H. Rai R. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20477-20482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). At odds with this conclusion is the fact that Sekito et al. (20Sekito T. Liu Z. Thornton J. Butow R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 795-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) demonstrate that RTG target genes are repressed during growth in glutamate in a rapamycin-inducible manner. A key difference between these studies is that ammonia as well as glutamate was present in the growth medium used by Sekito et al. (20Sekito T. Liu Z. Thornton J. Butow R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 795-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Thus, we reasoned ammonia might act to convert RTG target gene expression from a rapamycin-insensitive to a rapamycin-sensitive mode during growth in glutamate. To test this possibility directly, we used Northern blotting to examine expression of CIT2 when the prototrophic strain Σ1278b was grown in media containing different defined nitrogen sources followed by treatment with rapamycin (Fig. 1A). The results showed that rapamycin treatment had no effect on CIT2 expression when cells were grown in minimal dextrose (MD) media that contained either proline (MD-Pro) or glutamate (MD-Glu) as a sole nitrogen source (Fig. 1A). Significant induction was, however, observed when cells were grown in media that contained both glutamate and ammonia (MD−Glu/NH4+) (Fig. 1A, lanes 9 and 10), in agreement with the above prediction. The level of CIT2 induction caused by rapamycin was similar in MD−Glu/NH4+ as in MD-Gln (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 6 and 10). A higher level of CIT2 expression was observed in MD−NH4+, and this level was induced further by rapamycin (Fig. 1A, lanes 11 and 12), in agreement with previous observations (22Tate J.J. Cox K.H. Rai R. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20477-20482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The addition of ammonia to proline media also resulted in rapamycin-inducible CIT2 expression (data not shown). Together these results demonstrate that cells switch to a rapamycin-sensitive mode of CIT2 repression when both ammonia and glutamate (or proline) are present in the growth medium. While this work was in progress Tate et al. (33Tate J.J. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36924-36933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) also reported that using glutamate as a sole source of nitrogen results in rapamycin-insensitive CIT2 repression, in agreement with our present findings (33Tate J.J. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36924-36933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To determine the strain specificity of our results, we examined the effects of rapamycin treatment on CIT2 expression when a different prototrophic strain, S288c, was grown in glutamate media that either contained or lacked ammonia (Fig. 1B). Here similar results were obtained, namely, that ammonia converted repression of CIT2 to a rapamycin-sensitive mode during growth in glutamate (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 7 and 8 and lanes 9 and 10). By contrast, strain-dependent differences were observed in the expression of the Gln3p-dependent target gene GAP1, where ammonia alone repressed this gene in the Σ1278b but not in the S288c background (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 5 and 11). This latter result suggests that the effect of ammonia on CIT2 expression in glutamate-containing media is distinct from the well established role of ammonia in nitrogen catabolite repression, where significant differences have been characterized between these two strain backgrounds (34Magasanik B. Jones E.W. Pringle J.R. Broach J.R. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces: Gene Expression. 2. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1992: 283-317Google Scholar, 35Magasanik B. Kaiser C.A. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 290: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). To determine whether these results extend to other known RTG target genes, we used DNA microarray analysis to compare global changes in gene expression when rapamycin was added to cells grown in MD-Glu versus MD-Gln, as described under “Materials and Methods.” For this analysis, we examined in parallel the expression profiles of the two prototrophic strains described above, S288c and Σ1278b, as well as a third prototroph, Σ2000 (Fig. 2). The results showed that rapamycin caused a significant increase in the expression of most RTG target genes in MD-Gln relative to MD-Glu in each of the three strains examined (Fig. 2). The sole exception was PYC1, where only minor differences where observed and only in two of the three strains examined, consistent with our previously published observation that the expression pattern of this gene is strain-specific (21Dilova I. Chen C.-Y. Powers T. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 389-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). We, therefore, conclude that rapamycin-insensitive repression during growth in glutamate is a general feature of RTG target gene regulation. Genome-wide analysis further revealed that no other major class of genes displayed significant differences in rapamycin-induced expression in MD-Gln versus MD-Glu, indicating this phenomenon is restricted primarily to RTG target genes (data not shown). We next characterized the interplay between glutamate, glutamine, and ammonia in mediating rapamycin-sensitive repression of CIT2 (Fig. 3). Similar levels of CIT2 induction were observed when rapamycin was added to cells grown in MD-Glu that had an equal concentration of either ammonia or glutamine (Fig. 3A, compare lanes 4 and 6). Decreasing the amount of ammonia or glutamine that was added to MD-Glu resulted in significantly less rapamycin-induced CIT2 expression (Fig. 3, B and C). In addition, we found that urea could substitute for ammonia, demonstrating that at least a portion of this response specifically requires intracellular ammonia (Fig. 3D, compare lanes 2 and 4). An important control for this latter experiment was the demonstration that urea did not provide a similar response in a dur1,2Δ mutant, which is unable to catabolize urea to ammonia (Fig. 3D, lane 10). Together these results"

Using an Ascaris embryo cell-free translation system, we found that the TMG-cap and spliced leader sequence synergistically collaborate to promote efficient translation, whereas addition of either a TMG-cap or spliced leader sequence alone decreased reporter activity. We cloned an A. suum embryo eIF4E homolog and demonstrate that this recombinant protein can bind m7G- and TMG-capped mRNAs in cross-linking assays and that binding is enhanced by eIF4G. Both the cap structure and the spliced leader (SL) sequence affect levels of A. suum eIF4E cross-linking to mRNA. Furthermore, the differential binding of eIF4E to a TMG-cap and to trans-spliced and non-trans-spliced RNAs is commensurate with the translational activity of reporter RNAs observed in the cell-free extract. Together, these binding data and translation assays with competitor cap analogs suggest that A. suum eIF4E-3 activity may be sufficient to mediate translation of both trans-spliced and non-trans-spliced mRNAs. Bioinformatic analyses demonstrate the SL sequence tends to trans-splice close to the start codon in a diversity of nematodes. This evolutionary conservation is functionally reflected in the optimal SL to AUG distance for reporter mRNA translation in the cell-free system. Therefore, trans-splicing of the SL1 leader sequence may serve at least two functions in nematodes, generation of an optimal 5′-untranslated region length and a specific sequence context (SL1) for optimal translation of trimethylguanosine capped transcripts.

Trends Genet. 2001; 17: 678-680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Spliced leader addition forms the mature 5′ end of the mRNA providing an unusual cap structure and common sequence to the mRNA. In the case of Caenorhabditis elegans, 70% of transcripts have one of two 22-base sequences, spliced leader 1 or spliced leader 2 (Ref. 2Zorio D.A. Cheng N.N. Blumenthal T. Spieth J.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 117-145Google Scholar). Because the spliced leader donor RNA exon has a 2,2,7-trimethylguanosine cap, rather than the usual monomethylguanosine cap, the product of the trans-splicing reaction is a TMG-capped mRNA (4Maroney P.A. Hannon G.J. Nilsen T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 709-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 5Thomas J. Conrad R.C. Blumenthal T.

Transsplicing may therefore affect translation initiation. The major function of SL2 trans-splicing in C. elegans is to contribute to the resolution of polycistronic transcripts to generate mature mRNAs (8Huang X.Y. Hirsh D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8640-8644Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 9Spieth J. Brooke G. Kuersten S. Lea K. Blumenthal T.

Trans-splicing also plays this role in some other organisms, including the kinetoplastid protozoans, and perhaps platyhelminths (11Ullu E. Tschudi C. Günzl A. Smith D.F. Parsons M. Molecular Biology of Parasitic Protozoa. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1996: 115-133Google Scholar, 12Davis R.E. Hodgson S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 89: 25-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear that resolution of polycistronic pre-mRNAs is the sole role for spliced leader trans-splicing, particularly in platyhelminths (see 13Davis R.E. Hardwick C. Tavernier P. Hodgson S. Singh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21813-21819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). 2R. E. Davis, unpublished data.2R. E. Davis, unpublished data. The predominant form of trans-splicing in C. elegans and other nematodes is SL1 trans-splicing (57% of C. elegans and at least 70% of Ascaris suum transcripts) (2Zorio D.A. Cheng N.N. Blumenthal T. Spieth J. Nature. 1994; 372: 270-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 14Maroney P.A. Denker J.A. Darzynkiewicz E. Laneve R. Nilsen T.W. RNA (N. Y.). 1995; 1: 715-723Google Scholar). However, the major role(s) of SL1 trans-splicing has yet to be defined in nematodes, and the role of trans-splicing in other organisms such as Ciona intestinalis and Hydra vulgaris also remains unknown (15Vandenberghe A.E. Meedel T.H. Hastings K.E.M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 294-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 16Stover N.A. Steele R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5693-5698Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Since trans-splicing has a profound effect on the 5′-UTR of mRNAs, it has long been postulated that SL1 and TMG-cap addition might influence translational efficiency of mRNAs (see Ref. 17Davis R.E. Parasitol. Today. 1996; 12: 33-40Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Indeed a survey of SL-containing transcripts showed that trans-splicing tends to occur close to the start codon of mRNAs, providing circumstantial evidence for a relationship between trans-splicing and translation (3Blumenthal T. Steward K. Riddle D.L. Blumenthal T. Meyers B.J. Priess J.R. C. elegans II. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 117-145Google Scholar). While the nematodes are a major focus of both genomic and developmental biology research, in vitro translation studies have not been conducted in C. elegans because of the lack of a competent cell-free system. Embryos of the parasitic nematode Ascaris are highly suitable for preparation of several types of biochemically competent extracts that have been used to examine multiple molecular processes in nematodes (18Maroney P.A.

Ascaris translation extracts were used to show that 80–90% of transcripts are trans-spliced (14Maroney P.A. Denker J.A. Darzynkiewicz E. Laneve R. Nilsen T.W. RNA (N. Y.). 1995; 1: 715-723Google Scholar). This same study found that the TMG-cap and SL1 sequence collaborate to increase translational efficiency in a micrococcal nuclease treated Ascaris extract. In recent years, development and characterization of in vitro eukaryotic translation systems have used cap dependence and synergy between the mRNA cap and poly(A)-tail as an important characteristic for validation of cell-free systems (Ref. 23Gallie D.R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2108-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar and reviewed in Ref. 24Sachs A.B. Sarnow P. Hentze M.W. Cell. 1997; 89: 831-838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Cap dependence and cap/poly(A) synergy are in vivo properties of translation, and some in vitro systems do not recapitulate these characteristics. Indeed only a few systems exhibiting cap/poly(A)-tail synergy exist, none of them allowing translation studies in a nematode cell-free system (25Gebauer F. Corona D.F.V. Preiss T. Becker P.B.

The effect of trans-splicing on protein synthesis in nematodes in a system known to reflect in vivo conditions has not been carried out. In fact, little has been done to functionally characterize many attributes of nematode translation, including 5′-UTR length and start codon choice, factors known to be important in mammalian and yeast translation systems (30Kozak M. Cell. 1978; 15: 1109-1123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 31Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 12: 857-872Crossref Scopus (2376) Google Scholar, 32Slusher L.B. Gillman E.C.

Translation initiation in yeast and mammals involves the binding of a multiprotein complex, eIF4F to the 5′ end of the mRNA (reviewed in Refs. 34Gingras A.-C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Annu. Rev.

Whereas eIF4E recognizes the 5′ mRNA cap structure, eIF4G acts as a coordinating scaffold, connecting eIF4E, eIF4A, and the poly(A)-binding protein (36Lamphear B.J. Kirchweger R. Skern T. Rhoads R.E.

The interaction of eIF4G with eIF4E has been shown to enhance binding of the latter to the mRNA cap (39Haghighat A. Sonenberg N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21677-21680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 40Gross J.D. Moerke N.J. von der Haar T. Lugovsky A.A. Sachs A.B. McCarthy J.E.G. Wagner G.

Raught B. Sonenberg N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 913-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1732) Google Scholar). Of these events, only the binding of eIF4E proteins to methylated nucleoside triphosphates (as a proxy for the mRNA cap structure) has been examined in nematodes. Whereas many organisms have one to two homologs of eIF4E, C. elegans has five (named ife-1 through 5, Ref. 41Jankowska-Anyszka M. Lamphear B.J. Aamodt E.J. Harrington T. Darzynkiewicz E. Stolarski R. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10538-10542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) that differ in their binding specificity for mono- and trimethyl-cap analogs. Of these proteins, C. elegans IFE-3 and IFE-4 most closely resemble the two human eIF4E proteins in primary structure, and both bind to an m7GTP-Sepharose column. IFE-1, -2, and -5 are capable of binding both m7GTP- and m 2,2,73GTP-Sepharose matrices (41Jankowska-Anyszka M. Lamphear B.J. Aamodt E.J. Harrington T. Darzynkiewicz E. Stolarski R. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10538-10542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Such binding experiments, along with structural modeling, were used to predict and define residues that might enable IFE-1, -2, and -5 binding to m 2,2,73GTP-Sepharose (42Miyoshi H. Dwyer D.S. Keiper B.D. Jankowska-Anyszka M. Darzynkiewicz E. Rhoads R.E. EMBO J. 2002; 17: 4680-4690Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These binding studies and in vivo functional experiments (43Keiper B.D. Lamphear B.J. Deshpande A.M. Jankowska-Anyszka M. Aamodt E.J. Blumenthal T. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10590-10596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) were used to support the hypothesis that C. elegans IFE-3 and -4 might be responsible for m7GpppG-based translation (with IFE-4 playing a non-essential role). IFE-1, -2, and -5 were predicted to play a role in m 2,2,73GpppG-cap based translation. However, conservation of these TMG-binding proteins across nematodes, differential binding of IFEs to a capped RNA (i.e. the in vivo substrate) rather than a cap analog, and their contribution to the translation of trans-spliced transcripts has not been examined. In the current study, we describe and use an Ascaris cell-free system to examine the effect of trans-splicing on translation. We show that the Ascaris in vitro system is mRNA cap-dependent and retains translational synergy between the cap structure (both m7G and TMG) and the poly(A)-tail, an effect that we have observed in vivo in separate studies. 3L.

Darzynkiewicz, and R. E. Davis, manuscript in preparation. We find that in our Ascaris extract, non-trans-spliced transcripts are most efficiently translated. Whereas either the TMG-cap or SL sequence alone have a detrimental effect on protein synthesis, together they promote translation of a reporter mRNA. We then show that Ascaris eIF4E-3 is capable of binding both m7G- and TMG-capped RNA. The cross-linking efficiency of Ascaris eIF4E-3 to mRNA may explain the translational activity of trans-spliced versus non-trans-spliced transcripts in the in vitro system. We have also used a bioinformatic analysis to show that the spliced leader (SL1) tends to splice close to the translation start codon across nematode species. This correlates in part with the most efficient SL to start codon distance for translation in our cell-free system and may therefore reflect evolutionary selection for optimal expression. The Ascaris system should be valuable for further characterizing and understanding nematode translation and the role of trans-splicing in post-transcriptional gene expression. The parasite cell-free extract may also prove useful for drug testing and identification of targets for rational drug design. A. suum Extract Preparation—Embryos were collected from the proximal third (∼4 cm) of A. suum uteri (Carolina Biological Supply). After rinsing in cold 1× PBS (140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 8 mm Na2HPO4, 2 mm KHPO4 (pH 7.5)), the uterine tissue was dissolved in 0.5 n NaOH. Embryos were washed extensively in cold H2O, twice in cold 1× PBS (pH 2.0), and stored in 5 volumes of PBS (pH 2.0) at 4 °C until required. Development was initiated by agitating embryos at 110 rpm, 30 °C in 1× PBS (pH 2.0). At day 5 (32–64 cell stage, determined by 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining), embryos were spun for 5 min at 750 × g, and the eggshells were removed by a 90-min 0.4 n KOH, 1.4% sodium hypochlorite treatment at 30 °C. After four washes in 10–20 volumes of cold 1× PBS (pH 7.4), the embryo pellet was resuspended in 0.4 volume of buffer A (10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm Tris (pH 7.9), 1 mm DTT, 1× Roche Applied Science EDTA-free complete protease inhibitors, 0.1 mm PMSF, 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin). The embryo suspension was homogenized within 5 min with 8–10 passes in a 15 ml Wheaton Dura-Grind® stainless steel dounce (Millville, NJ) and the homogenate centrifuged at 27,000 × g, 4 °C, 20 min. The intermediate layer (soluble non-lipid layer) was dialyzed twice against 1000–2000 volumes of ice-cold buffer (50 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF, 20% glycerol). The extract was then centrifuged (21,000 × g, 4 °C, 10 min), frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at–80 °C until use. In Vitro Transcription—PCR-generated templates for in vitro transcription were synthesized using the primers in supplemental Table I (which introduce a T7 promoter), from either pRL-null for Renilla luciferase or pGL3-Basic for firefly luciferase (Promega). The in vitro transcription reactions (T7 Megascript, Ambion) typically contained 1 μg of template, 10 mm ATP, 10 mm CTP, 10 mm UTP, 12 mm cap analogue (ApppG, m7GpppG, or m 2,2,73GpppG, Ref. 44Darzynkiewicz E. Stepinski J. Ekiel I. Jin Y. Haber D. Sijuwade T. Tahara S.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 8953-8962Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), 1.5 mm GTP, 1× Reaction buffer, 1× T7 polymerase mix and was carried out at 37 °C for 4 h. Uncapped transcription reactions lacked cap analog. After DNase I treatment, the mRNA transcript was purified, qualified by formaldehyde denaturing gel electrophoresis, and quantified using UV spectroscopy and the Ribogreen reagent (Molecular Probes). Analysis of cap orientation on transcripts was carried out as described (45Pasquinelli A.E. Dahlberg J.E. Lund E. RNA (N. Y.). 1995; 1: 957-967PubMed Google Scholar) and indicated that 90% of the m7GpppG and 80% of the m 2,2,73GpppG caps were added in the correct orientation. These analyses demonstrated that differences in the translation efficiencies observed were not a function of differences in cap orientation on the transcripts. Uniformly labeled transcripts for UV cross-linking were synthesized with the Promega T7 Riboprobe kit according to the manufacturer's instructions using 0.5 μg of template in a 20-μl reaction containing 50 μCi of [α-32P]GTP (3000 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), a 0.5 mm concentration each of CTP, UTP, and ATP, 0.2 mm GTP, and 1.6 mm cap analog. Uncapped transcripts were similarly generated without cap analog. The transcripts were gel-purified from 5% denaturing PAGE gels. Cap-labeled RNAs were prepared from uncapped RNA substrates using [α-32P]GTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and recombinant vaccinia RNA guanylyltransferase and (guanine-N7)-methyltransferase (generously provided by Stewart Shuman) or human guanylyltransferase (generously provided by Aaron Shatkin) (46Cohen L.S.

RNA sequences used for translation and cross-linking are provided in supplemental Table II. In Vitro Translation and Reporter Quantification—Ten-microliter translation reactions contained 5–12.5 μg/ml reporter RNA, 50% Ascaris embryo extract (∼125–150 μg of extract protein), 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 125 mm KOAc, 25 mm KCl, 2.6 mm Mg(OAc)2, 0.5 mm GTP, 0.5 mm ATP, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 50 μg/ml creatine kinase, 2.5 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 μm Promega amino acid mix, 0.25 mm PMSF, and 10% glycerol. After 30–60 min at 30 °C, the translation reaction was diluted in the appropriate lysis buffer (Promega) and frozen on dry ice. Typically, 0.1% of the reaction was read in a Sirius luminometer v.2.2 (Berthold Detection Systems). Dual assay experiments were performed by mixing 62.5 ng of test mRNA (Renilla luciferase) with 62.5 ng m7G-firefly luciferase. After 1 h, translation was assayed using the Promega dual luciferase assay kit. Statistical analysis was carried out using Prism 4.0. Cloning and Sequence Analysis of eIF4E Genes—A. suum eIF4E-3 (GenBank™ Accession number AY599493) was cloned from 32–64 cell cDNA (synthesized as described below) (12Davis R.E. Hodgson S. Mol.

RACE products were directionally cloned into the pAMP vector (Invitrogen), as described by the manufacturer. 3′ RACE was then used to obtain the entire open reading frame of A. suum eIF4E-3 (primers in supplemental Table I). C. elegans ife-1 and ife-3 coding regions were obtained from mixed stage oligo(dT) or random primed C. elegans cDNA using the primers in supplemental Table I. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using neighbor-joining and Bayesian methods (see overviews in Refs. 51Swofford D.L. Olsen G.J. Waddell P.J. Hillis D.M. Hillis D.M. Moritz C. Mable B.K.

Recombinant Protein Production and Nucleotide Binding Studies— The eIF4E open reading frames were cloned into the NdeI/BamHI sites of pET16b and transformed into Rosetta(DE3) bacteria (Novagen). Protein production was induced overnight (25 °C) using 0.4 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The bacterial pellet was frozen at–80 °C, then sonicated in lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 100 mm KCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, 0.4× Roche Applied Science EDTA-free protease inhibitors), and the fusion protein was purified on aNi2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Qiagen). The bound protein was eluted using an imidizole gradient (10–500 mm), dialyzed against buffer B (50 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF, 20% glycerol) and stored at –80 °C. For cap analog binding studies, recombinant protein was added to m7GTP-Sepharose or m 2,2,73GTP-Sepharose 4B beads (41Jankowska-Anyszka M. Lamphear B.J. Aamodt E.J. Harrington T. Darzynkiewicz E. Stolarski R. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10538-10542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and incubated for 45 min at 4 °C on a rotating platform. The beads were collected, the supernatant removed (unbound fraction), and the beads washed three times in buffer B (above). Protein bound to the beads and in the unbound fraction were analyzed by 12.5% SDS-PAGE to determine protein binding efficiency to the matrices. Proteins were detected by Coomassie Blue staining or SYPRO Ruby labeling (Molecular Probes). UV cross-linking was performed by incubating 500 ng of recombinant protein with 250,000 dpm of uniformly labeled RNA (or 100,000 dpm of cap-labeled RNA) for 10 min at 30 °C in 20 μl of buffer (100 mm KOAc, 2mm Mg(OAc)2, 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 2 mm DTT, 3% glycerol). Cross-linking was then performed in a Hoefer UV Cross-linker, at a distance of 4 cm (120,000 μJ/cm2) for 30 min on ice. The cross-linked mRNA was then treated with 20 μg of RNase A (United States Biochemical, 37 °C for 30 min) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE on a 4–15% Tris-HCl gel (Bio-Rad), and the gel was exposed to Kodak BioMax film overnight at –80 °C. Cross-linked proteins were also imaged and analyzed using the STORM 860 and ImageQuant programs (Amersham Biosciences). Search for Spliced Leaders in Ascaris Embryos—To assess the presence of SL sequences on Ascaris embryo mRNAs, an oligonucleotidecapped cDNA library was constructed from 32–64 cell stage A. suum embryo RNA (12Davis R.E. Hodgson S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 89: 25-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 47Fromont-Racine M. Bertrand E. Pictet R. Grange T.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2507-2511Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In brief, total RNA was dephosphorylated with alkaline phosphatase (Roche Applied Science), decapped using tobacco acid pyrophosphatase (Epicenter Technologies), and an RNA oligonucleotide (see supplemental Table I) ligated to the 5′ end of RNAs using T4 RNA ligase (New England Biolabs) under the conditions described by the manufacturers. First strand cDNA was synthesized using an adaptor oligo(dT) primer and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) at 42 °C for 30 min, followed by addition of more Superscript enzyme and a further incubation at 50 °C for 30 min. Reverse transcription-PCR products were generated using primers complementary to the RNA oligonucleotide and the 3′ adaptor sequence. PCR products ∼500–1000 and 1000–3000 bp were gel-purified and directionally cloned using ligation-independent cloning with the pAMP system (Invitrogen). The 5′ ends (only ∼30 nucleotides) of ∼1500 randomly selected clones were directly sequenced from bacterial lysates using 32P-end-labeled primers and cycle sequencing. Bioinformatic Analysis of SL to AUG Distance—The position of the spliced leader sequence relative to the start codon in trans-spliced mRNAs was ascertained using cDNA and EST sequences from available developmental stages in current databases. We took the following steps to ensure that only cDNA sequences that truly contain a spliced leader were assessed. Nematode cDNA sequences that contain an entire spliced leader sequence at their 5′ end were identified using a BLASTN search of the NCBI nr data base. Additional sequences were found using BLASTN searches of EST data bases at NCBI and the NEM-BLAST server (nema.cap.ed.ac.uk/ncbi_blast.html). Libraries based on PCR amplification with an SL containing primer were not used (to avoid sequences where an SL had been fortuitously introduced by PCR primers). The predicted start codon was either that specified in the data base entry or the most 5′ AUG of the longest open reading frame in the sequence (in the case of ESTs). The A. suum in Vitro Translation Extract Is Cap-dependent and Shows Synergy between the Cap and Poly(A)-tail—A. suum embryonic extracts have previously been used to study translation in vitro (14Maroney P.A. Denker J.A. Darzynkiewicz E. Laneve R. Nilsen T.W. RNA (N. Y.). 1995; 1: 715-723Google Scholar).

The human high affinity copper importer, hCtr1, and its yeast and murine orthologues have been shown to mediate the uptake of cisplatin. This transporter is located at the plasma membrane under low copper conditions, and excess copper concentrations stimulate its endocytosis and degradation. In this study we further examined the link between cisplatin and hCtr1 by examining whether cisplatin can also stimulate the endocytosis and degradation of hCtr1. The steady-state location of hCtr1 and its endocytosis from the plasma membrane were not altered by cisplatin treatment. Unexpectedly, cisplatin treatment of a cell line expressing hCtr1 revealed the time- and concentration-dependent appearance of a stable hCtr1 multimeric complex, consistent with a homotrimer, which was not observed following copper treatment of these same cells. Mutagenesis studies identified two methionine-rich clusters in the extracellular amino-terminal region of hCtr1 that were required for stabilization of the hCtr1 multimer by cisplatin, suggesting that these sequences bind cisplatin and form crosslinks between hCtr1 polypeptides. Treatment with the metal chelator dimethyldithiocarbamate disassembled the hCtr1 multimer following cisplatin exposure, suggesting that platinum was an integral component of this complex. These studies provide the first evidence for a direct interaction between cisplatin and the hCtr1 protein and establish that cisplatin and copper have distinct biochemical consequences on this transporter.

Copper is an essential metal for various metabolic processes including oxidative phosphorylation, catecholamine biosynthesis, antioxidant defense, pigmentation, and iron homeostasis (1Puig S. Thiele D.J. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2002; 6: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Like all essential metals, copper is potentially toxic at elevated concentrations, and homeostatic mechanisms have evolved to provide sufficient copper for metabolic requirements while avoiding copper toxicity. Copper homeostasis is accomplished through the action of copper transporters and intracellular copper chaperones. High affinity copper uptake at the plasma membrane in humans is mediated by the hCtr1 protein (2Zhou B. Gitschier J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Members of the Ctr1 family have three putative membrane-spanning domains, and studies on human Ctr1 (hCtr1) and yeast Ctr1 (yCtr1) suggest that these proteins assemble as homodimers and -trimers (3Lee J.

Recent studies have also shown that elevated copper concentrations stimulate the endocytosis and degradation of hCtr1 and yCtr1 proteins (7Guo Y. Smith K. Lee J. Thiele D.J. Petris M.J. J. Biol.

Once in the cytoplasm, copper is delivered to specific destinations via one of three copper chaperones, CCS, COX17, or ATOX1 (1Puig S. Thiele D.J. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2002; 6: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). CCS delivers copper to superoxide dismutase, COX17 delivers copper to cytochrome c oxidase, and ATOX1 transfers copper to one of two copper-transporting ATPases, ATP7A or ATP7B. The ATP7A and ATP7B proteins are located in the trans-Golgi network and are required to deliver copper into secretory compartments for the assembly of copper-requiring enzymes (10Petris M.J.

An unexpected connection has recently been discovered between the copper transporters and the accumulation of, and resistance to, the chemotherapy drug cisplatin (cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (DDP)). 1The abbreviations used are: DDP, cis-diamminedichloroplatinum; EGS, ethylene glycol bis(succinimidylsuccinate); PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; DDTC, diethydithiocarbamate; HEK, human embryonic kidney. The ectopic expression of ATP7A and ATP7B in cultured cells is associated with DDP resistance (14Komatsu M. Sumizawa T. Mutoh M. Chen Z.S. Terada K. Furukawa T. Yang X.L. Gao H. Miura N. Sugiyama T.

It is thought that these copper transporters confer DDP resistance by transporting DDP into vesicular compartments, thereby sequestering the drug from cytotoxic targets (19Samimi G. Safaei R. Katano K. Holzer A.K. Rochdi M. Tomioka M. Goodman M. Howell S.B. Clin. Cancer Res. 2004; 10: 4661-4669Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Recent studies have also implicated a role for the Ctr1 copper importer in the uptake of DDP. Deletion of yCtr1 in yeast or mCtr1 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts confers DDP resistance. This is associated with reduced uptake of the drug (20Lin X. Okuda T. Holzer A. Howell S.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 1154-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 21Ishida S. Lee J.

In support of this proposed role, studies have demonstrated that the overexpression of human hCtr1 protein in ovarian carcinoma cell lines results in the increased uptake of DDP (22Holzer A.K. Samimi G. Katano K. Naerdemann W. Lin X. Safaei R. Howell S.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar). Interestingly, however, DDP toxicity is not significantly increased in these hCtr1-overexpressing cells, and the internalized DDP does not have ready access to the DNA, suggesting that the DDP imported by hCtr1 is prevented from reaching cytotoxic targets (22Holzer A.K. Samimi G. Katano K. Naerdemann W. Lin X. Safaei R. Howell S.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar). Despite a role for hCtr1 in DDP uptake, it remains unclear whether the drug can also exert regulatory control over the location and trafficking of the hCtr1 protein. In this study, we further examined the link between DDP and hCtr1 by testing whether DDP can mimic the ability of copper to stimulate the endocytosis and degradation of hCtr1 in human cells. Rather than stimulating hCtr1 endocytosis, DDP treatment resulted in the stabilization of a high molecular weight complex of the hCtr1 protein that was consistent with a homotrimer. This DDP-mediated appearance of the hCtr1 multimer was reversible upon chelation of platinum from the complex, and mutagenesis studies identified two extracellular methionine-rich clusters that were essential for this process. These findings suggest that the uptake of DDP is associated with the formation of a stable homotrimer that is stabilized via interactions between DDP and the methionine-rich clusters. Cell Lines and Reagents—The human embryonic kidney cell line, HEK293, was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum under 5% CO2. This basal medium contains ∼1 μm copper. HEK293 cells stably transfected with the pcDNA3.1 empty vector or the same vector harboring the wild type or M1/M2 mutant hCTR1 cDNAs have been described previously (7Guo Y. Smith K. Lee J. Thiele D.J. Petris M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17428-17433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 8Petris M.J. Smith K. Lee J. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9639-9646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). DDP, oxaliplatin, and carboplatin were purchased from Sigma and freshly prepared prior to each experiment. Copper was supplied to the growth medium as CuCl2. In vitro cross-links were generated by treating cell lysates with 100 mm ethylene glycol bis(succinimidylsuccinate) (EGS) (Sigma) as described previously (3Lee J. Pena M.M. Nose Y. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4380-4387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). The affinity-purified anti-myc antibody (clone 9E10) was purchased from Roche Applied Science. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells were grown on sterile glass coverslips coated with poly-l-lysine (Sigma) and treated with DDP and/or copper as indicated. After rinsing twice with 1 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), cells were fixed for 10 min at 25 °C using 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. Cells were blocked for 1 h with 1% bovine serum albumin and 3% skim milk in PBS and probed with the anti-myc antibodies (10 μg/ml) followed by Alexa 488 antimouse antibodies (1:1000). Immunoblots and Endocytosis Assays—For immunoblot detection of the total hCtr1 protein, de novo protein synthesis was inhibited by pretreating cells for 30 min with 100 μg/ml cycloheximide, which was subsequently maintained throughout copper and DDP treatments. This allowed changes in levels of monomeric hCtr1 to be observed without the confounding effects of new protein synthesis. Cells cultured in 6-well trays were scraped into ice-cold PBS and pelleted by centrifugation. After several washes in ice-cold PBS, the cells were lysed for 20 min on ice in buffer containing 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 16,000 × g, and 20 μg of protein lysates were separated using non-reducing 4–20% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and detected by chemiluminescence using anti-myc antibodies (1:1000) followed by anti-mouse antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (1:5000). The endocytosis of hCtr1-myc protein was determined by measuring the uptake of anti-myc antibodies added to the culture medium of stably transfected HEK293 cells, as described previously (8Petris M.J. Smith K. Lee J. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9639-9646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells in 6-well trays were incubated in the presence of 10 μg/ml anti-myc antibodies for 5 min at 37 °C in basal medium or media containing the indicated concentrations of copper and/or DDP. Cells were washed twice with PBS on ice, and surface-bound antibodies were removed by three washes in ice-cold acidic buffer (100 mm glycine, 20 mm magnesium acetate, 50 mm potassium chloride, pH 2.2). Cells were harvested by scraping into ice-cold PBS and pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 × g. The cell pellets were solubilized in lysis buffer (above), and 20 μg of lysates containing internalized anti-myc antibodies were separated using 4–20% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and detected by chemiluminescence using HRP-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies. Several studies have suggested that the yeast, murine, and human Ctr1 orthologues function in the uptake of DDP (22Holzer A.K. Samimi G. Katano K. Naerdemann W. Lin X. Safaei R. Howell S.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar). To further explore the connection between DDP and hCtr1, we tested whether DDP could mimic the ability of copper to stimulate the endocytosis of a functional myc-tagged human hCtr1 protein stably expressed in HEK293 cells (3Lee J. Pena M.M. Nose Y. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4380-4387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 8Petris M.J. Smith K. Lee J. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9639-9646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). As expected, the exposure of cells to 20 μm copper for 1 h altered the distribution of hCtr1-myc from the plasma membrane to a predominantly vesicular localization (Fig. 1, compare A with B). A longer exposure of 2 h in the presence of elevated copper reduced the intensity of this vesicular staining (Fig. 1C), consistent with the degradation of hCtr1-myc by high copper concentrations reported previously (8Petris M.J. Smith K. Lee J. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9639-9646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). However, when cells were exposed to 200 μm DDP for 1 or 2 h, the location of the hCtr1-myc protein was unchanged from the plasma membrane distribution observed in untreated cells (Fig. 1, D and E). Longer DDP exposure times (6 h) and higher DDP concentrations (up to 1 mm) failed to alter the location of hCtr1-myc (data not shown). These data suggested that the location of hCtr1 was not altered in response to DDP. We then tested whether a pretreatment of cells with DDP could block the relocalization of hCtr1 by copper. Pretreating cells with 200 μm DDP for 1 h failed to block the copper-induced redistribution of hCtr1 to vesicles when 20 μm copper was subsequently added to the DDP-containing media (Fig. 1F). These data suggest that the steady-state location of hCtr1 is not affected by DDP, and that a 10-fold molar excess of DDP does not inhibit copper-stimulated endocytosis. To more rigorously test the effect of DDP on the location of hCtr1, we examined whether the endocytosis of hCtr1 was altered by DDP. The extracellular location of the myc tag permits analysis of hCtr1-myc endocytosis by the measurement of the internalization of anti-myc antibodies from the media by living cells expressing this protein. This method has been used to define the kinetics, sensitivity, and metal specificity of copper-stimulated endocytosis of hCtr1-myc (8Petris M.J. Smith K. Lee J. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9639-9646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 23Petris M.J. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2004; 447: 752-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). As expected, copper was found to stimulate endocytosis of hCtr1-myc, as was evident by the increased internalization of anti-myc antibodies by copper-treated HEK/hCtr1-myc cells relative to untreated cells (Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and 4). However, in DDP-treated cells, there was no change in the extent of hCtr1-myc endocytosis relative to untreated cells (Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and 5). Moreover, pretreating HEK/hCtr1-myc cells with 200 μm DDP for 1 h failed to block copper-stimulated endocytosis of hCtr1 after the addition of 20 μm copper to the DDP-containing media (Fig. 2A, lane 6). There was no uptake of anti-myc antibodies by vector-transfected control cells in basal medium or medium containing 100 μm copper (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 2), indicating that the uptake of antibodies was dependent on the hCtr1-myc protein. Control experiments demonstrated that neither DDP nor copper in the media affected the binding of anti-myc antibodies to the hCtr1-myc protein at the surface of cells (data not shown). Further studies were undertaken to test whether a high DDP concentration affects the sensitivity of hCtr1 endocytosis to low micromolar copper concentrations that are closer to the Km for copper uptake activity (∼2 μm copper) (3Lee J. Pena M.M. Nose Y. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4380-4387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 24Eisses J.F. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29162-29171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). A pre-exposure for 1 h to 200 μm DDP did not alter the copper-stimulated endocytosis of hCtr1-myc in response to low micromolar copper concentrations compared with untreated cells (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 6–10 with lanes 1–5). These findings independently confirmed the immunofluorescence studies and suggested that DDP does not stimulate the endocytosis of the hCtr1-myc protein or block the ability of copper to induce this process. We then examined the possibility that DDP may cause the degradation of the hCtr1 protein. The hCtr1 protein migrates as a 35-kDa monomer and a 70-kDa dimer in non-reducing SDS gels (3Lee J. Pena M.M. Nose Y. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4380-4387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 24Eisses J.F. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol.

J. 2002; 364: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Both of these expected sizes for hCtr1-myc were observed by immunoblot analysis of HEK/hCtr1-myc cells using anti-myc antibodies (Fig. 3, lane 2, ovals). A cross-reacting endogenous protein was also detected by the anti-myc antibody in HEK293 cells (Fig. 3, lane 1, asterisk) as reported previously (7Guo Y. Smith K. Lee J. Thiele D.J. Petris M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17428-17433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 8Petris M.J. Smith K. Lee J. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9639-9646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The exposure of cells to elevated copper levels resulted in the degradation of hCtr1-myc, as indicated by the marked diminution of both 35- and 70-kDa bands (Fig. 3, lane 3). Surprisingly, treating HEK/hCtr1-myc cells with increasing concentrations of DDP resulted in the appearance of a slower migrating complex of 110 kDa with the concomitant diminution of the 35- and 70-kDa species (Fig. 3, lanes 4–8). At both 10 and 50 μm DDP concentrations, the 110-kDa hCtr1 multimer was clearly visible as a double band, suggesting that various conformations may exist for this complex. The apparent molecular weight of this complex was close to that predicted for a homotrimeric form of hCtr1, suggesting that DDP may stabilize this trimeric form by forming cross-links between hCtr1 polypeptides. To further characterize the stabilization of the hCtr1 multimer by DDP, a time course analysis of this process was undertaken. The exposure of HEK/hCtr1-myc cells to DDP for 30 s was sufficient to allow detection of the 110-kDa hCtr1 multimer (Fig. 4, lane 2), and saturation was observed between 30 and 60 min (Fig. 4, lanes 6 and 7). Interestingly, the multimerization of hCtr1 was also observed when DDP was added to cells that had been pre-cooled to 4 °C (Fig. 4, lane 9), a condition that is known to block both hCtr1-dependent copper transport activity and endocytosis of the protein (3Lee J. Pena M.M. Nose Y. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4380-4387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 8Petris M.J. Smith K. Lee J. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9639-9646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). This observation suggested that the stabilization of the hCtr1 multimer does not require the uptake of DDP or the endocytosis of hCtr1 and therefore may involve DDP-mediated cross-links between regions of hCtr1 proteins that are exposed at the cell surface. If stabilizing the hCtr1 multimer did involve DDP-mediated cross-links, we predicted that such a process would be reversible upon extraction of DDP from the protein complex. The metal chelator diethydithiocarbamate (DDTC) was tested for the ability to reverse DDP-induced hCtr1 multimerization. This agent is a strong chelator of platinum compounds and has been shown to protect against DDP-induced cytotoxicity (26Dedon P.C. Borch R.F. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1987; 36: 1955-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 27Hidaka S. Funakoshi T. Shimada H. Tsuruoka M. Kojima S. J. Appl. Toxicol. 1995; 15: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 28Borch R.F. Pleasants M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 6611-6614Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). HEK/hCtr1-myc cells were initially exposed to 200 μm DDP to generate the multimeric hCtr1 complex. The protein lysates from these cells were then exposed to a range of DDTC concentrations prior to analysis of hCtr1 by Western blotting. A dose-dependent disassembly of the hCtr1 complex was observed following the exposure to DDTC, as indicated by the loss of the 110-kDa hCtr1 multimer (Fig 5A, lanes 4–8). These data further support the hypothesis that DDP mediates cross-links between hCtr1 proteins. Previous studies have demonstrated that the hCtr1 dimer is unstable in the presence of reducing agents, and mutagenic studies suggest that a cytoplasmic cysteine at position 189 may form a disulfide bridge between hCtr1 subunits (24Eisses J.F. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29162-29171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). To further characterize the DDP-mediated multimerization of hCtr1, we assessed whether the 110-kDa multimer is stable to the presence of the reducing agent dithiothreitol. As expected, the addition of dithiothreitol to protein lysates derived from untreated cells resulted in the marked reduction of the 70-kDa hCtr1 dimer relative to non-reducing conditions (Fig. 5B, compare lane 3 with lane 1). Significantly, however, pretreatment of the cells with DDP resulted in hCtr1 dimeric and trimeric complexes in the protein lysates that were highly stable in the presence of dithiothreitol (Fig. 5B, compare lane 2 with lane 4). These data suggest that the stabilization of the hCtr1 multimer occurs independently of the disulfide bridges between hCtr1 subunits and is largely unaffected by reduction of these bonds. A notable feature of the hCtr1 protein is two methionine-rich clusters located in the extracellular amino-terminal portion of the molecule (Fig. 6A). These “Mets” motifs, with the sequences 7MGMSYM12 and 40MMMMPM45, are highly conserved among Ctr1 family members from yeast, plants, insects, and mammals (1Puig S. Thiele D.J. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2002; 6: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). The 40MMMMPM45 motif closest to the first transmembrane domain of hCtr1 was recently shown to be critical for both the high affinity copper uptake and for stimulating hCtr1 endocytosis in response to low micromolar copper levels (∼2 μm) (7Guo Y. Smith K. Lee J. Thiele D.J. Petris M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17428-17433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 29Puig S. Lee J. Lau M. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26021-26030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Given the propensity of DDP to bind to the sulfur-containing amino acids methionine and cysteine (26Dedon P.C. Borch R.F. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1987; 36: 1955-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 30Montine T.J. Borch R.F. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1990; 39: 1751-1757Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 31Roche P.A.

Cancer Res. 1984; 44: 5764-5770PubMed Google Scholar), we tested the importance of the Mets motifs in DDP-induced multimerization of hCtr1. Each methionine of both Mets motifs was mutated to alanine resulting in the M1/M2 mutant (Fig. 6A). DDP treatment of cells resulted in the stabilization of the 110-kDa complex for the wild type hCtr1 protein (Fig. 6B, lane 2), but no such complex was observed for the M1/M2 mutant protein (Fig. 6B, lane 5). Immunofluorescence microscopy confirmed that there was abundant expression of the M1/M2 mutant protein at the plasma membrane (Fig. 6A), suggesting that the absence of a 110-kDa multimer was not because of a defect in trafficking of this mutant protein to the cell surface. Significantly, when the protein cross-linker EGS was added to protein lysates from the M1/M2 mutant cell line, the 110-kDa multimer was readily observed at levels equivalent to the wild type protein (Fig. 6, compare lanes 3 and 6). This result suggested that although the M1/M2 mutation does not prevent interactions between hCtr1 subunits, it prevents the stabilization of these interactions by DDP. These findings suggest that in the wild type protein, DDP may stabilize interactions between hCtr1 proteins by cross-linking the Mets motifs. Previous studies in yeast have demonstrated that yCtr1-deficient cells are resistant to a variety of cisplatin analogues (20Lin X. Okuda T. Holzer A. Howell S.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 1154-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), suggesting that these compounds may be transported by the Ctr1 family of transporters. Therefore, we compared the abilities of DDP and two clinically important cisplatin analogues to induce the multimerization of hCtr1. DDP, carboplatin (cis-diammine-1,1-cyclobutanedicarboxylateplatinum), or oxaliplatin (trans-1-diaminocyclohexane oxalatoplatinum) was supplied to the media of HEK/hCtr1-myc cells at 50 or 500 μm for 3 h (Fig. 7); this was followed by immunoblot detection of hCtr1-myc protein. Both carboplatin and oxaliplatin treatments resulted in the appearance of the 110-kDa hCtr1 multimer, but this occurred less efficiently relative to DDP, particularly in the case of carboplatin. Neither carboplatin nor oxaliplatin altered the plasma membrane location of hCtr1 in HEK/hCtr1-myc cells (data not shown), as was found earlier for DDP (Fig. 1). These data suggest that DDP and two of its clinically important analogues are able to stabilize the 110-kDa hCtr1 multimer, albeit with different efficacies. Given the recent finding that the hCtr1 protein undergoes copper-stimulated endocytosis and degradation, we tested whether DDP could elicit a similar posttranslational response. Using two independent approaches involving immunofluorescence microscopy and endocytosis assays, we found no evidence that DDP alters the steady-state distribution or the endocytosis of hCtr1, which remained unchanged in DDP-treated cells. Unexpectedly, DDP exposure resulted in the appearance of a novel 110-kDa hCtr1 multimeric complex, suggesting that DDP may bind to hCtr1 and form cross-links between hCtr1 molecules. This process was rapid and occurred in a dose-dependent manner at minimal DDP concentrations that were similar to plasma concentrations of DDP observed clinically (33Oguri S. Sakakibara T. Mase H. Shimizu T. Ishikawa K. Kimura K. Smyth R.D. J. Clin. Pharmacol. 1988; 28: 208-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 34Panteix G. Beaujard A. Garbit F. Chaduiron-Faye C. Guillaumont M. Gilly F. Baltassat P. Bressolle F. Anticancer Res. 2002; 22: 1329-1336PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies using cross-linking agents and co-immunoprecipitation experiments suggested that Ctr family members in yeast and humans form homodimer and -trimer complexes (3Lee J. Pena M.M. Nose Y. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4380-4387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 4Dancis A. Haile D. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 33244-33251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The apparent molecular weight of the 110-kDa hCtr1 complex in DDP-treated cells was consistent with a homotrimeric form of hCtr1, but the possibility that this complex results from interactions between hCtr1 and other proteins cannot be excluded by our results. It was notable that carboplatin and oxaliplatin also resulted in the appearance of the hCtr1 multimer because these drugs share little structural similarity to cisplatin beyond their common platinum cores. These findings suggest that it is the platinum ion itself that stabilizes the hCtr1 multimer rather than an indirect pharmacological effect of the drug treatment. Furthermore, the ability of the metal chelator DDTC to disassemble the 110-kDa hCtr1 multimer provided additional evidence that platinum is integral to the structure of this complex. The stabilization of the hCtr1 multimer by DDP is not specific to the HEK293 cell line, as we have observed the same effect in a range of hCtr1-transfected cell lines (data not shown), including A2780 ovarian carcinoma cells, in which the exogenous expression of hCtr1 has been shown to increase DDP uptake (22Holzer A.K. Samimi G. Katano K. Naerdemann W. Lin X. Safaei R. Howell S.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar). DDP is a neutral molecule consisting of a platinum ion with two ammonia and two chloride ligands. It becomes positively charged when its chloride ions are displaced by water in the plasma or intracellular fluid. In this active form, DDP is able to cross-link DNA strands and selectively bind sulfur-containing amino acids such as cysteine and methionine (36Stone P.J. Kelman A.D. Sinex F.M.

Our studies demonstrated that the Mets motifs were critical for the appearance of the 110-kDa hCtr1 multimer in DDP-treated cells but not for multimerization per se, suggesting that DDP may stabilize this complex by cross-linking the Mets motifs of interacting hCtr1 polypeptides. Interestingly, recent yeast two-hybrid experiments have shown that individual amino-terminal domains of hCtr1 can interact (41Klomp A.E. Juijn J.A. van der Gun L.T. van den Berg I.E. Berger R. Klomp L.W. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 881-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), suggesting that in principle, the Mets motifs may come close enough to be cross-linked by DDP. It is also notable that DDP has been shown to stabilize the multimeric interactions of the α2-macroglobulin and serum albumin (32Gonias S.L. Oakley A.C. Walther P.J. Pizzo S.V. Cancer Res. 1984; 44: 5764-5770PubMed Google Scholar, 42Gonias S.L. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12478-12484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that methionine residues are involved in DDP-induced inter-subunit cross-linking for both proteins (31Roche P.A. Strickland D.K. Enghild J.J. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6715-6721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Ivanov A.I. Christodoulou J. Parkinson J.A. Barnham K.J. Tucker A. Woodrow J. Sadler P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14721-14730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). In contrast to our observation that the endocytosis of hCtr1 is not affected by DDP treatment, DDP has been shown to promote the endocytosis and degradation of yCtr1 in yeast (21Ishida S. Lee J. Thiele D.J. Herskowitz I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14298-14302Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). The reasons for the different effects of DDP on the human and yeast Ctr1 proteins are unclear. Both proteins share only 29% identity, and the yeast orthologue is considerably larger. Moreover, the longer extracellular amino-terminal region of yCtr1 contains eight Mets motifs, compared with only two motifs in the human protein. Perhaps these sequence differences alone may account for the different consequences of DDP on human and yeast orthologues. Alternatively, it is possible that like hCtr1, DDP does indeed promote formation of a multimeric complex of the yCtr1 protein. However, unlike hCtr1, the concomitant stimulation of endocytosis and degradation of this multimer may prevent its detection by immunoblot analysis. Future studies that make use of yeast mutants defective in endocytosis and/or degradation may permit the detection of a cisplatin-stabilized multimer of yCtr1. The mechanism of hCtr1 transport is not well understood. Although there is evidence to suggest that yCtr1 and hCtr1 form homotrimers, it is currently unclear whether the assembly of such a complex is required for copper transport activity. The hCtr1 polypeptide possesses three putative membrane-spanning regions, and therefore the assembly of a homotrimeric complex should result in a channel consisting of nine transmembrane domains. Our data suggest that DDP may stabilize this trimeric form of hCtr1 by bridging the Mets motifs of interacting hCtr1 subunits. This may facilitate the creation of a pore through which DDP is able to cross the membrane into the cytoplasm, possibly by diffusion down a concentration gradient. Alternatively, others have postulated that the uptake of DDP may be coupled with the endocytosis of a yCtr1-DDP complex (21Ishida S. Lee J. Thiele D.J. Herskowitz I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14298-14302Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar), and such a mechanism may also occur for the hCtr1 protein (22Holzer A.K. Samimi G. Katano K. Naerdemann W. Lin X. Safaei R. Howell S.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar). Our finding that DDP fails to increase hCtr1 endocytosis does not rule out an endocytic mechanism for the uptake of the drug, because endocytosis of hCtr1 still occurs at basal rates in DDP-treated cells (Fig. 2). Indeed, the uptake of DDP via internalization of an hCtr1-DDP complex to a vesicular compartment is consistent with recent studies in hCtr1-transfected A2780 ovarian carcinoma cells, which suggest that DDP taken up by hCtr1 is restricted from accessing cytotoxic targets like DNA (22Holzer A.K. Samimi G. Katano K. Naerdemann W. Lin X. Safaei R. Howell S.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar). This endocytic model of DDP uptake is also appealing because it offers an explanation for how the hCtr1 protein can be highly selective for Cu(I) over other divalent metal ions and yet mediate the uptake of DDP, which shares little structural similarity to elemental copper. In summary, our studies have provided the first evidence for a biochemical interaction between hCtr1 and DDP and have identified candidate DDP-binding sequences in the extracellular region of hCtr1. Further analysis of how DDP stabilizes the multimerization of hCtr1 will provide a more detailed understanding of the mechanism by which hCtr1 mediates DDP uptake and how it differs from that of copper. Our findings highlight potentially valuable new directions for research into candidate platinum-based chemotherapy agents by assessing their propensity to cross-link hCtr1, along with studies examining the abundance and multimeric state of hCtr1 in various tumors and cell lines that respond differently to these agents.

These proteins are characterized by an N-terminal RING-B box-coiled-coil (RBCC) motif and a C-terminal PHD finger/bromodomain unit, and have been implicated in epigenetic mechanisms of transcriptional repression involving histone modifiers and heterochromatin-binding proteins. We describe here the isolation and functional characterization of a fourth murine TIF1 gene, TIF1δ. The predicted TIF1δ protein displays all the structural hallmarks of a bona fide TIF1 family member and resembles the other TIF1s in that it can exert a deacetylase-dependent silencing effect when tethered to a promoter region. Moreover, like TIF1α and TIF1β, TIF1δ can homodimerize and contains a PXVXL motif necessary and sufficient for HP1 (heterochromatin protein 1) binding. Although TIF1α and TIF1β also bind nuclear receptors and Krüppel-associated boxes specifically and respectively, TIF1δ appears to lack nuclear receptor- and Krüppel-associated box binding activity. Furthermore, TIF1δ is unique among the TIF1 family proteins in that its expression is largely restricted to the testis and confined to haploid elongating spermatids, where it associates preferentially with HP1 isotype γ (HP1γ) and forms discrete foci dispersed within the centromeric chromocenter and the surrounding nucleoplasm. Collectively, these data are consistent with specific, nonredundant functions for the TIF1 family members in vivo and suggest a role for TIF1δ in heterochromatin-mediated gene silencing during postmeiotic phases of spermatogenesis.

Transcriptional regulation of gene expression in eukaryotes in response to developmental or environmental signals is a complex multistep process that requires the concerted action of many cellular factors. Central players in this elaborate process are sequence-specific transcription factors that positively and/or negatively control transcription through interactions with transcriptional intermediary factors (TIFs 1The abbreviations used are: TIF, transcriptional intermediary factor; RBCC, RING-B box-coiled-coil; NR, nuclear receptors; KRAB, Krüppel-associated boxes; RXR, retinoid X receptor; RAR, retinoic acid receptor; TR, thyroid receptor; VDR, vitamin D3 receptor; ER, estrogen receptor; mAb, monoclonal antibody; ORF, open reading frame; DAPI, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RT, reverse transcription; NGS, normal growth serum; GST, glutathione S-transferase; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; AAD, acidic activation domain; OMPdecase, orotidine 5′-monophosphate decarboxylase; TSA, trichostatin A; PtdInsPs, phosphoinositides; ERE, estrogen-response element; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyl-transferase; DBD, DNA binding domain.; also designated as coactivators and corepressors), whose ultimate function is to remodel chromatin structure (1Hassan A.H.

TIF1s are members of a growing family of chromatin-associated/related TIFs, a subset that has emerged as key regulators of developmental and physiological processes (6Cammas F. Losson R. Recent Res.

TIF1α, the founding member of the family, was initially identified in a yeast genetic screen for proteins modulating the transactivation potential of retinoid X receptor (RXR) (7Le Douarin B.

TIF1α is a euchromatin-enriched chromosomal protein expressed ubiquitously and early in development (17Niederreither K. Remboutsika E. Gansmuller A. Losson R. Dollé P. Mech. Dev. 1999; 88: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 18Remboutsika E. Lutz Y. Gansmuller A. Vonesh J.-L. Losson R. Chambon P. J.

Losson R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2020-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). In mouse NIH 3T3 cells, TIF1α was reported to play a role in the growth-suppressive activity of RXR/RAR and to exhibit a transforming activity when fused to a truncated B-Raf (19Zhong S. Delva L. Rachez C. Cenciarelli C. Gandini D. Zhang H. Kalantry S. Freedman L.P. Pandolfi P.P. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Supporting the notion that the biological functions of TIF1α are achieved through modulation of chromatin states, TIF1α has been demonstrated to possess an intrinsic transcriptional silencing activity that requires histone deacetylation (8Le Douarin B.

Khechumian R. Gansmuller A. Chambon P. Losson R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6385-6395Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Moreover, TIF1α has the ability to interact directly with members of the heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) family (8Le Douarin B. Nielsen A.L. Garnier J.-M. Ichinose H. Jeanmougin F. Losson R. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6701-6715Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar), a class of nonhistone chromosomal proteins that serve as dose-dependent regulators of higher order chromatin structures to promote silencing on euchromatic genes (reviewed in Refs. 21Eissenberg J.C. Elgin S.C. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 204-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar and 22Li Y. Kirschmann D.A. Wallrath L.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16462-16469Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Mapping of the HP1-interacting domain in TIF1α led to the identification of a conserved PXVXL motif located in its central region that binds directly to the C-terminal chromoshadow domain of HP1 proteins (8Le Douarin B. Nielsen A.L. Garnier J.-M. Ichinose H. Jeanmougin F. Losson R. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6701-6715Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar) and exists in other potential transcriptional regulatory targets (23Smothers J.F. Henikoff S. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 27-30Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The identification of TIF1β established the TIF1 family of transcriptional cofactors (8Le Douarin B. Nielsen A.L. Garnier J.-M. Ichinose H. Jeanmougin F. Losson R. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6701-6715Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). TIF1β (also known as KAP-1 or KRIP-1) was isolated by virtue of its ability to interact with mouse HP1α (8Le Douarin B. Nielsen A.L. Garnier J.-M. Ichinose H. Jeanmougin F. Losson R. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6701-6715Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar) and with the KRAB domain of the human Krüppel-like proteins KOX1 (24Friedman J.R. Fredericks W.J. Jensen D.E. Speicher D.W.

A. 1996; 93: 15299-15304Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The KRAB transcriptional repression domain is a widely distributed motif frequently found at the N termini of zinc finger proteins of Krüppel Cys2-His2-type (27Looman C. Abrink M. Mark C. Hellman L. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2002; 19 (and references therein): 2118-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). This domain contains a conserved KRAB A box and is usually followed by a KRAB B box (or a diverged b box; Ref. 28Mark C. Abrink M. Hellman L. DNA Cell Biol. 1999; 18: 381-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). All variants of the KRAB domain studied so far function through the recruitment of TIF1β (29Abrink M. Ortiz J.A. Mark C. Sanchez C. Looman C. Hellman L. Chambon P. Losson R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1422-1426PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with a role in chromatin organization, TIF1β silences transcription through a mechanism that involves histone deacetylation (20Nielsen A.L. Ortiz J.A. You Y. Oulad-Abdelghani M.

Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 919-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar), and recruitment of HP1 proteins by a PXVXL motif (20Nielsen A.L. Ortiz J.A. You Y. Oulad-Abdelghani M. Khechumian R.

Biol. 2000; 20: 6449-6465Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Most importantly, this motif is also required to trigger the relocalization of TIF1β into regions of centromeric heterochromatin during cell differentiation (33Cammas F. Oulad-Abdelghani M. Chambon P. Losson R. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3439-3448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In mouse, TIF1β is expressed ubiquitously throughout development (34Cammas F. Mark M. Dolle P. Dierich A. Chambon P. Losson R. Development (Camb.). 2000; 127: 2955-2963PubMed Google Scholar) and in many adult tissues (26Kim S.-S. Chen Y.-M. O'Leary E. Witzgall R. Vidal M. Bonventre J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15299-15304Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that disruption of TIF1β in mice leads to an embryonic lethal phenotype due to a developmental arrest at the egg cylinder stage, prior to the onset of gastrulation (34Cammas F. Mark M. Dolle P. Dierich A. Chambon P. Losson R. Development (Camb.). 2000; 127: 2955-2963PubMed Google Scholar), thus demonstrating that TIF1β exerts essential and nonredundant functions during early post-implantation development. Subsequently, the use of a conditional germ line-specific disruption of TIF1β in the adult testis unveiled a later and essential nonredundant function of TIF1β in the homeostasis of the seminiferous epithelium (35Weber P. Cammas F. Gerard C. Metzger D. Chambon P. Losson R. Mark M. Development (Camb.). 2002; 129: 2329-2337PubMed Google Scholar). The third mammalian member of the TIF1 family, TIF1γ, was discovered via low stringency hybridization screens using TIF1α as a probe (9Venturini L. You J. Stadler M. Galien R. Lallemand V. Koken M.H.M. Mattei M.G. Ganser A. Chambon P. Losson R. de Thé H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1209-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Amino acid comparison revealed that, among the three mammalian members of the family, TIF1γ is closer to TIF1α than to TIF1β (50% overall identity between TIF1α and TIF1γ and ∼30% identity among the other TIF1s) (9Venturini L. You J. Stadler M. Galien R. Lallemand V. Koken M.H.M. Mattei M.G. Ganser A. Chambon P. Losson R. de Thé H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1209-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 36Yan K. Dollé P. Mark M. Lerouge T. Wendling O. Chambon P. Losson R. Gene (Amst.). 2004; 334: 3-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In vitro, TIF1α and TIF1γ hetero-oligomerize as efficiently as they homo-oligomerize, whereas TIF1β does homooligomerize but does not hetero-oligomerize with TIF1α or TIF1γ (12Peng H. Feldman I. Rauscher III, F.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 629-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 37Germain-Desprez D. Bazinet M. Bouvier M. Aubry M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 20: 22367-22373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been shown that an overexpression of TIF1γ in transiently transfected cells can interfere with the transrepression activity of TIF1α (12Peng H. Feldman I. Rauscher III, F.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 629-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Further evidence supporting a cross-talk between TIF1α and TIF1γ is the recent identification of two novel types of RET rearrangements in childhood papillary thyroid carcinomas, PTC6 and PTC7, having in common the RET receptor tyrosine kinase domain fused to the RBCC domains of TIF1α (PTC6) and TIF1γ (PTC7), respectively (38Klugbauer S. Rabes H.M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4388-4393Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In both human and mouse, TIF1γ transcripts are widely expressed at varying levels in adult and fetal tissues (9Venturini L. You J. Stadler M. Galien R. Lallemand V. Koken M.H.M. Mattei M.G. Ganser A. Chambon P. Losson R. de Thé H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1209-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 36Yan K. Dollé P. Mark M. Lerouge T. Wendling O. Chambon P. Losson R. Gene (Amst.). 2004; 334: 3-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Similar to the other TIF1 family members, TIF1γ contains an intrinsic transcriptional silencing function (9Venturini L. You J. Stadler M. Galien R. Lallemand V. Koken M.H.M. Mattei M.G. Ganser A. Chambon P. Losson R. de Thé H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1209-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar); however, the downstream targets that mediate gene silencing have yet to be identified. Recently, we isolated and characterized the only ortholog of mammalian TIF1s in the Drosophila genome, the so-called Bonus (10Beckstead R. Ortiz J.A. Sanchez C. Prokopenko S.N. Chambon P. Losson R. Bellen H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 753-765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Bonus is a chromatin-associated protein that is expressed throughout development. Mutational analysis revealed that Bonus is required for male viability, molting, and numerous events in metamorphosis that are associated with genes implicated in the ecdysone pathway, a nuclear hormone receptor pathway required throughout Drosophila development (10Beckstead R. Ortiz J.A. Sanchez C. Prokopenko S.N. Chambon P. Losson R. Bellen H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 753-765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Bonus shares with TIF1α the ability to interact with the nuclear receptor AF-2 activation domain (10Beckstead R. Ortiz J.A. Sanchez C. Prokopenko S.N. Chambon P. Losson R. Bellen H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 753-765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Direct evidence for the biological relevance of this evolutionarily conserved interaction was provided by genetic studies showing that reduction in the level of Bonus suppresses the phenotype associated with a partial loss of function mutation of the nuclear receptor βFTZ-F1 (10Beckstead R. Ortiz J.A. Sanchez C. Prokopenko S.N. Chambon P. Losson R. Bellen H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 753-765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), thus defining Bonus (and by analogy TIF1α) as negative regulators of nuclear receptor-dependent transcription. Here we report the isolation and functional analysis of a fourth murine TIF1 gene, TIF1δ. Over the entire length of the 1344-amino acid protein, TIF1δ shares ∼30% identity with the other TIF1s and also displays a potent trichostatin A (TSA, a specific inhibitor of histone deacetylases)-sensitive repression function. However, TIF1δ differs remarkably from the other TIF1 family members in that its expression is largely restricted to testis, where it was seen by immunohistochemistry only in male germ cells that have completed meiosis, at the early elongating spermatid stages. TIF1δ was localized by confocal laser-scanning microscopy in discrete nuclear foci distributed throughout the nucleus including the chromocenter, a condensed structure formed by the association of centromeric heterochromatin. Furthermore, a preferential association between TIF1δ and HP1 isotype γ (HP1γ) has been identified through coimmunoprecipitation. Taken together, these data suggest a role for TIF1δ as a negative regulator of postmeiotic genes acting through HP1γ complex formation and centromere association. Clone Isolation and Sequencing—Four exon-specific primers designed according to the nucleotide sequences of predicted human TIF1δ exons in the KIAA0298 genomic sequence (GenBank™ accession number AJ400879) were used to amplify two DNA probes by RT-PCR. Primers used are as follows: (a) forward primer, 5′-AACCCAAGATGGCCAGGAAC-3′ (AAU20) and reverse primer, 5′-GCCCTGGACATTTGTCCACC-3′ (AAU21), and (b) forward primer, 5′-CAGAGCCTTCAATAGTGAGC-3′ (AAU22) and reverse primer 5′-TGCCTTGGCTGGGCAAACCG-3′ (AAU23). RT-PCR amplification was performed on 0.5 μg of HeLa total RNA using the Clostridium thermocellum polymerase One-step RT-PCR system (Roche Applied Science). The amplified DNA fragments were used as probes to screen a λZAPII mouse brain-derived cDNA library (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. These screens resulted in the isolation of two mouse cDNA clones, TIF1δ-a (nucleotides +212 to +1322) and TIF1δ-b (nucleotides +2011 to +4111) (see Fig. 1B). Complete sequence information of the coding region was achieved by RT-PCR using 1.5 μg of mouse testis total RNA as template and the following primer pairs: (a) TIF1δ exon 9 forward primer, 5′-TTCCAGTCTCCAGCACTGTG-3′ (ACD251), and TIF1δ exon 10 reverse primer, 5′-AGAGCTGGCTTTGGGCCCTC-3′ (ACD252), designed from the TIF1δ-a and TIF1δ-b sequences, respectively; and (b) TIF1δ exon 1 forward primer, 5′-ATAACTTGGACCTCGGAGAC-3′ (ADA27), and TIF1δ exon 3 reverse primer, 5′-ATGTGTGCTGCCCGCTTCTC-3′ (ACM266), designed on the basis of the nucleotide sequences of putative TIF1δ exon 1 (GenBank™ accession number AJ307670) and TIF1δ-a cDNA clone, respectively. The resulting RT-PCR products (TIF1δ-c (nucleotides +1240 to +2045), TIF1δ-d1 (nucleotides -183 to +353), and TIF1δ-d2 (nucleotides -183 to +353 containing a deletion of 63 nucleotides), see Fig. 1, B and D) were gel-purified and subcloned into pBluescript II SK(+) (Stratagene). Three independent clones of amplified cDNAs from each RT-PCR were subjected to DNA sequence analysis. To extend the TIF1δ cDNA sequence toward its 3′ end, a 3′-RACE experiment was performed using the SMART RACE kit (Clontech), with mouse testis total RNA and the gene-specific forward primer, TIF1δ exon 19 primer, 5′-TACATGCAGGAAGGCATCCA-3′ (AFA51). The fragment amplified by 3′-RACE (TIF1δ-e (nucleotides +3931 to +4254)) was purified, cloned, and sequenced. Northern Blot Analysis—Multiple mouse tissue Northern blots containing poly(A)+ RNA from various tissues (Clontech) were hybridized with a cDNA fragment encoding amino acids 671-976 of TIF1δ (nucleotides +2011 to +2930) or a β-actin cDNA fragment (control) labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random priming according to the manufacturer's instructions. Antibodies—Specific antibodies used include the following: (a) mouse anti-TIF1δ monoclonal antibody (mAb), PG124, raised against TIF1δ-(132-151) for immunohistochemistry, and rabbit anti-TIF1δ polyclonal antibody, PG78, raised against TIF1δ-(695-721) for Western blot analysis. The specificity of these antibodies was established with an extract of COS-1 cells transfected with a eukaryotic expression plasmid encoding FLAG-tagged TIF1δ (Fig. 5 and data not shown). (b) mouse anti-HP1α mAbs, 2HP1H5 for immunoprecipitation and immunohistochemistry and 2HP2G9 for Western blot analysis (18Remboutsika E. Lutz Y. Gansmuller A. Vonesh J.-L. Losson R. Chambon P. J.

For the double immunostaining experiments, anti-HP1β and -HP1γ antibodies were purified by the caprylic acid/ammonium sulfate method and then coupled to biotin (Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin kit, ES-Link, Pierce) or to Cy3 (Cy3 mAb labeling kit, Amersham Biosciences); mouse anti-FLAG mAb, 2Fl1B11 (gift of M. Oulad-Abdelghani, IGBMC, France); mouse anti-VP16 mAb, 2GV4 (39Le Douarin B. Pierrat B. vom Baur E. Chambon P. Losson R.

Losson R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 876-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar); and mouse anti-β-actin mAb, AC-15 (Sigma). Immunohistochemistry—Testes from 3-month-old mice were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (12 h at 4 °C) and then embedded in Paraplast. Five-μm-thick sections were collected on Superfrost slides (Kindler, Freiburg, Germany), dried for 16 h at 37 °C, and kept at 4 °C until use. Sections were dried again for 15 min at 57 °C, dewaxed, hydrated, then placed into 0.01 m sodium citrate buffer, pH 6.0, and exposed to microwave treatment (power output 900 watts; 10 min). After cooling down to room temperature, sections were rinsed in PBS, treated with 5% NGS in PBS, 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS/NGS/Tween) for 30 min at room temperature to block nonspecific antibody binding to the tissue, and incubated for 16 h at 4 °C with the anti-TIF1δ antibody PG124 (ascites dilution: 1/1000 in PBS/NGS/Tween). Sections were then washed (PBS; three times for 5 min), incubated with the secondary antibody (Cy3-coupled goat anti-mouse, diluted 1/500, The Jackson Laboratories) for 1 h at room temperature, washed in PBS, and mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) containing DAPI (Roche Applied Science) at 10 μg/μl. As negative controls of the immunostaining procedure, histological sections were incubated with a mixture of the primary antibody (diluted 1/1000) and immunizing peptide (5 μg/ml). Double immunostaining experiments were performed as follows. Following incubation with the primary anti-TIF1δ antibody PG124 as described above, testis sections were then washed (PBS; three times for 5 min), incubated with the secondary antibody (Alexa488-coupled goat anti-mouse, diluted 1/250, The Jackson Laboratories) for 45 min at room temperature, washed in PBS, and incubated with either Biotin-coupled anti-HP1β antibody 1Mod1A9 (dilution 1/150 in PBS) or Cy3-coupled anti-HP1γ antibody 2Mod1G6 (dilution 1/50 in PBS) for 12 h at 4 °C. TIF1δ/HP1β double-labeled sections were then washed (PBS, three times for 5 min), incubated with Cy3-coupled streptavidin (dilution 1/250 in PBS, The Jackson Laboratories) for 45 min at room temperature, washed in PBS, fixed in 4% formalin (10 min, room temperature), then washed again in PBS and mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) containing DAPI at 10 μg/μl. Washing, fixation, and mounting were also done for TIF1δ/HP1γ double-labeled sections. Confocal images were obtained using a Leica confocal scanning microscope (SP1) and were superposed using home-made software. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Testes from adult mice were homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer in ice-cold lysis buffer (EBC: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 170 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaF) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and a protease inhibitor mixture of aprotinin, leupeptin, chymostatin, and pepstatin at 2.5 μg/ml each. Intact cells and debris were removed by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C, and supernatants were collected. Protein concentration was determined with Bio-Rad protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad). To immunoprecipitate the HP1 proteins, testicular lysates (15 mg) were first incubated with 50 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were removed by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 2 min, and 5 μl of specific antibody was then added. Samples were incubated for 3 h at 4 °C, followed by incubation overnight with 50 μl of Protein G-Sepharose beads at 4 °C. Immune complexes were collected by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 2 min and washed three times with 3 ml of EBC buffer. The final pellets were then resuspended in 50 μl of 2× Laemmli SDS buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 2% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.002% bromphenol blue) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting as described previously (40Nielsen A.L.

Transient Transfection—Transient transfection in COS-1 cells as well as CAT and β-galactosidase assays were performed as described (8Le Douarin B. Nielsen A.L. Garnier J.-M. Ichinose H. Jeanmougin F.

https://openalex.org/W2080441958,"Catalase-peroxidases (KatGs) are heme peroxidases with a catalatic activity comparable to monofunctional catalases. They contain an unusual covalent distal side adduct with the side chains of Trp122, Tyr249, and Met275 (Synechocysis KatG numbering). The known crystal structures suggest that Tyr249 and Met275 could be within hydrogen-bonding distance to Arg439. To investigate the role of this peculiar adduct, the variants Y249F, M275I, R439A, and R439N were investigated by electronic absorption, steady-state and transient-state kinetic techniques and EPR spectroscopy combined with deuterium labeling. Exchange of these conserved residues exhibited dramatic consequences on the bifunctional activity of this peroxidase. The turnover numbers of catalase activity of M275I, Y249F, R439A, and R439N are 0.6, 0.17, 4.9, and 3.14% of wild-type activity, respectively. By contrast, the peroxidase activity was unaffected or even enhanced, in particular for the M275I variant. As shown by mass spectrometry and EPR spectra, the KatG typical adduct is intact in both Arg439 variants, as is the case of the wild-type enzyme, whereas in the M275I variant the covalent link exists only between Tyr249 and Trp122. In the Y249F variant, the link is absent. EPR studies showed that the radical species formed upon reaction of the Y249F and R439A/N variants with peroxoacetic acid are the oxoferryl-porphyrin radical, the tryptophanyl and the tyrosyl radicals, as in the wild-type enzyme. The dramatic loss in catalase activity of the Y249F variant allowed the comparison of the radical species formed with hydrogen peroxide and peroxoacetic acid. The EPR data strongly suggest that the sequence of intermediates formed in the absence of a one electron donor substrate, is por·+ → Trp· (or Trp·+) → Tyr·. The M275I variant did not form the Trp· species because of the dramatic changes on the heme distal side, most probably induced by the repositioning of the remaining Trp122–Tyr249 adduct. The results are discussed with respect to the bifunctional activity of catalase-peroxidases.

Catalase-peroxidases (KatGs) 1The abbreviations used are: KatG, catalase-peroxidase; CcP, cytochrome c peroxidase; APX, ascorbate peroxidase; CD, circular dichroism; EPR, electron paramagnetic resonance; HF EPR, high-field electron paramagnetic resonance. are present in bacteria and fungi and function primarily as hydrogen peroxide scavengers (1Loewen P.C.

Biophys. 1992; 296: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Sequence similarities indicate they are members of the class I of the superfamily of plant, fungal, and bacterial peroxidases (4Welinder K.G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1992; 2: 388-393Crossref Scopus (778) Google Scholar). In contrast to the other members of this group, such as cytochrome c peroxidase (CcP) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX), they show a high catalase activity comparable with monofunctional catalases. Although the catalase activity is overwhelming, KatGs also show a substantial peroxidase activity with various one electron donors. There are three crystal structures of KatGs available, namely the Archaebacterium Haloarcula marismortui (5Yamada Y. Fujiwara T. Sato T. Igarashi N. Tanaka N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 691-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), Burkholderia pseudomallei (6Carpena X. Loprasert S. Mongkolsuk S. Switala J. Loewen P.C. Fita I. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 475-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and Synechococcus PCC 7942 (PDB entry 1UB2), the latter being a cyanobacterial KatG with high homology to Synechocystis KatG. The structures show that the arrangement of the active site is similar to CcP and APX, containing the distal triad arginine, histidine, tryptophan, and the proximal triad aspartate, tryptophan, and histidine. The coordinates of these amino acids are virtually identical in all three enzymes. An unprecedented covalent bond between the distal side tryptophan, tyrosine, and methionine residues (in Synechocystis numbering Trp122, Tyr249, and Met275) was proposed to be present in the H. marismortui enzyme (5Yamada Y. Fujiwara T. Sato T. Igarashi N. Tanaka N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 691-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). A mass spectrometric analysis of the tryptic peptides from recombinant wild-type KatG and the tryptophan, tyrosine, and methionine variants of Synechocystis (7Jakopitsch C. Kolarich D. Petutschnig G. Furtmuller P.G. Obinger C. FEBS Lett. 2003; 552: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and B. pseudomallei (8Donald L.J. Krokhin O.V. Duckworth H.W. Wiseman B. Deemagarn T. Singh R.

Chem. 2003; 278: 35687-35692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) confirmed that this novel covalent adduct really exists in solution and thus may be a common feature to all catalase-peroxidases. In Synechocystis KatG exchange of either Trp122 or Tyr249 prevents cross-linking, whereas exchange of Met275 still allowed the covalent bond formation between Trp122 and Tyr249 (7Jakopitsch C. Kolarich D. Petutschnig G. Furtmuller P.G. Obinger C. FEBS Lett. 2003; 552: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The integrity of the covalent adduct appears to be important for the catalase but not the peroxidase activity of catalase-peroxidases. Upon exchange of the distal Trp (Trp122 in Synechocystis) the catalase activity was dramatically diminished in the Escherichia coli (9Hillar A. Peters B. Pauls R. Loboda A. Zhang H. Mauk A.G. Loewen P.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5868-5875Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) or even lost in the Synechocystis (10Regelsberger G. Jakopitsch C. Ruker F. Krois D. Peschek G.A. Obinger C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22854-22861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) enzymes, whereas the peroxidase activity was not affected in both cases. Moreover, upon exchange of the cross-linked Tyr residue (Tyr249 in Synechocystis) the bifunctional enzyme was totally converted to a monofunctional peroxidase (11Jakopitsch C. Auer M. Ivancich A. Ruker F. Furtmuller P.G. Obinger C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20185-20191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The Y249F variant shows spectral and kinetic features characteristic of most plant-type peroxidase intermediates, namely compounds I and II (11Jakopitsch C. Auer M. Ivancich A. Ruker F.

Chem. 2003; 278: 20185-20191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Additionally, the B. pseudomallei variant M264L (Met275 in Synechocystis) showed a significantly reduced overall catalase but an intact peroxidase activity (8Donald L.J. Krokhin O.V. Duckworth H.W. Wiseman B. Deemagarn T. Singh R. Switala J. Carpena X. Fita I. Loewen P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35687-35692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the Trp-Tyr-Met adduct appears to be hydrogen-bonded to a neighboring arginine residue (Arg439 in Synechocystis). In the H. marismortui and Synechococcus PCC 7942 KatG crystallographic structures, the corresponding arginine residue (Arg409) is in hydrogen-bonding distance to both Tyr218 and Met244 (Fig. 1A). Specifically, the NH1 and the NH2 groups of Arg409 form hydrogen bonds with the phenol oxygen of Tyr218 and the backbone oxygen of Met244, respectively (Fig. 1A). However, in the crystal structure of B. pseudomallei KatG, the corresponding arginine (Arg426) points away from the covalent adduct in its predominant orientation (6Carpena X. Loprasert S. Mongkolsuk S. Switala J. Loewen P.C. Fita I. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 475-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and no hydrogen bonds can be formed (Fig. 1B). Only in its minor conformation (30%) are the side chains of Arg426 in a favorable position to form hydrogen bonds, as in the case of H. marismortui (6Carpena X. Loprasert S. Mongkolsuk S. Switala J. Loewen P.C. Fita I. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 475-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The structural requirements that enable a peroxidase to disproportionate hydrogen peroxide are not really understood. The presence of the covalent adduct in KatGs as well as the arginine with the two possible orientations suggest that the region may have a yet undefined function in KatG catalysis. In order to investigate the role of Met275 and Arg439 in the bifunctional activity of KatG and in the formation of the covalent adduct, the variants M275I, R439A, and R439N have been prepared and characterized by both steady-state and transient-state kinetic UV-vis spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. In comparison to wild-type KatG, these variants exhibit dramatic differences in both the catalase and the peroxidase activities, as well as the spectral features and kinetics of interconversion between their redox intermediates. The radical intermediates formed by the M275I, R439A, and R439N variants were also investigated by using EPR spectroscopy and compared with those formed by the Y249F variant. Only the M275I variant indirectly induced a significant change in the heme microenvironment so that the tryptophanyl radical intermediate was not formed. The same three radical intermediates previously identified in the wild-type enzyme (exchange-coupled oxoferryl-porphyrin, tryptophanyl, and tyrosyl radicals) (13Ivancich A. Jakopitsch C. Auer M. Un S. Obinger C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 14093-14102Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) were observed for the other variants. The possibility of using hydrogen peroxide for radical formation allowed us to predict the sequence of radical formation. Materials—Standard chemicals and biochemicals were obtained from Sigma at the highest grade available. Cloning, expression, and purification of wild-type KatG and the M275I and the Y249F variants from Synechocystis were described previously (11Jakopitsch C. Auer M. Ivancich A. Ruker F. Furtmuller P.G.

Jakopitsch C. Auer M. Un S. Obinger C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 14093-14102Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of Arg439—Oligonucleotide site-directed mutagenesis was performed using PCR-mediated introduction of silent mutations as described (10Regelsberger G. Jakopitsch C. Ruker F. Krois D. Peschek G.A. Obinger C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22854-22861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). A pET-3a expression vector that contained the cloned catalase-peroxidase gene from the cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC 6803 (14Jakopitsch C. Rüker F. Regelsberger G. Dockal M. Peschek G.A. Obinger C. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 1087-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) was used as the template for PCR. At first, unique restriction sites were selected flanking the region to be mutated. The flanking primers were 5′-GGC ACC CGG ATC CTT TAT G-3′ containing a BamHI restriction site and 5′-AGT GCA GAC TAG TTC GGA AAC G-3′ containing an SpeI restriction site. The internal 3′-primer was 5′-TGT GAG TAA GCT TAA ACC AGG CC-3′ and possessed a HindIII restriction site. The following mutant primers with the desired mutation and a silent mutation introducing a restriction site were constructed (point mutations italicized and restriction sites underlined): 5′-CTG GTT TAA GCT TAC TCA CAACGA TCT AGG AC-3′ changed Arg439 to N; 5′-GTT TAA GCT TAC TCA CGC GGA TCT AGG AC-3′ changed Arg439 to Ala. The fragment defined by the BamHI and SpeI restriction sites was replaced by the new construct containing the point mutation. All constructs were sequenced to verify DNA changes using thermal cycle sequencing. Spectroscopic Studies—Optical spectra were recorded on a diode array spectrophotometer (Zeiss Specord S10) and a Hitachi U-3000 spectrophotometer equipped with a thermostatted cell holder. Circular dichroism studies were carried out using a JASCO J-600 spectropolarimeter. Far-UV (190–260 nm) experiments were carried out using protein concentrations of 1.5 μm and the path length of the cuvette was 1 mm. A good signal-to-noise ratio in the CD spectra was obtained by averaging twelve scans (resolution: 1 nm; bandwidth: 1 nm, response 16 s; scan speed 20 nm/min). The protein concentration was calculated from the known amino acid composition and absorption at 280 nm according to Gill and Hippel (15Gill C. Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5072) Google Scholar). Steady-state Kinetics—Catalase activity was determined polarographically in 50 mm phosphate buffer using a Clark-type electrode (YSI 5331 Oxygen Probe) inserted into a stirred water bath (YSI 5301B) at 30 °C. Alternatively, the catalase activity was measured by continuously monitoring hydrogen peroxide concentration polarographically with a platinum electrode covered with a hydrophilic membrane and fitted to the Amperometric Biosensor Detector 3001 (Universal Sensors, Inc.). The applied electrode potential at pH 7 was 650 mV, and the H2O2 electrode-filling solution was prepared fresh each half-day. The electrode was calibrated against known concentrations of hydrogen peroxide. All reactions were performed at 30 °C and started by the addition of KatG. One unit of catalase is defined as the amount that decomposes 1 μmol of H2O2/min at pH 7 and 30 °C. To cover the pH range 4–9 50 mm citrate-phosphate or 50 mm Tris/HCl buffers were used. Since the potential of hydrogen peroxide increases with decreasing pH the applied electrode potential had to be changed from 890 mV (pH 4) to 530 mV (pH 9). Peroxidase activity was monitored spectrophotometrically using 1 mm H2O2 and 5 mm guaiacol (ϵ470 = 26.6 mm-1 cm-1) or 1 mmo-dianisidine (ϵ460 = 11.3 mm-1 cm-1) or 500 μm ascorbate (ϵ290 = 2.8 mm-1 cm-1). Additionally, peroxidase activity was measured with peroxoacetic acid (1 mm) instead of H2O2. One unit of peroxidase is defined as the amount that decomposes 1 μmol of electron donor/min at pH 7 and 30 °C. Transient-state Kinetics—Transient-state measurements were made using the model SX-18MV stopped-flow spectrophotometer from Applied Photophysics equipped with a 1-cm observation cell thermostatted at 15 °C. Calculation of pseudo-first order rate constants (kobs) from experimental traces at the Soret maximum was performed with the SpectraKinetic workstation v4.38 interfaced to the instrument. The substrate concentrations were at least five times that of the enzyme to allow determination of pseudo-first order rate constants. Second order rate constants were calculated from the slope of the linear plot of pseudo-first order rate constants versus substrate concentration. To follow spectral transitions a photodiode array accessory (model PD.1 from Applied Photophysics) connected to the stopped-flow machine together with the XScan Diode Array Scanning v1.07 software was utilized. The kinetics of oxidation of ferric KatG variants to compound I by peroxoacetic acid or hydrogen peroxide or the formation of the cyanide complex were followed in the single mixing mode. Ferric KatG and either peroxide or cyanide were mixed to give a final concentration of 1 μm enzyme and 5–250 μm peroxide or 20–500 μm cyanide. The first data point was recorded 1.5 ms after mixing, and 2000 data points were accumulated. Sequential mixing stopped-flow analysis was used to measure compound I reduction by one-electron donors. In the first step the enzyme was mixed with peroxoacetic acid or H2O2 and, after a delay time where compound I was built, the intermediate was mixed with the electron donors aniline, ascorbate, or o-dianisidine. All stopped-flow determinations were measured in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 and 15 °C, and at least three determinations were performed per substrate concentration. The temperature (15 °C) was used to allow comparison of the transient state kinetic data with those obtained with other variants of Synechocystis KatG. Mass Spectrometry—Molecular masses were determined on a LC/ESI-MS apparatus (Waters Micromass Q-TOF Ultima Global) as previously reported (7Jakopitsch C. Kolarich D. Petutschnig G. Furtmuller P.G. Obinger C. FEBS Lett. 2003; 552: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The proteolytic digest patterns were compared with virtual digests performed by the PeptideMass software, which is available via the ExPASy World Wide Web server, at the URL address (www.expasy.ch/www/tools.html). EPR Spectroscopy—Conventional 9-GHz EPR measurements were performed using a Bruker ER 300 spectrometer with a standard TE102 cavity equipped with a liquid helium cryostat (Oxford Instrument) and a microwave frequency counter (Hewlett Packard 5350B). Typically, EPR samples were prepared by mixing manually 0.5–1.0 mm native enzyme (100 mm Tris maleate buffer, pH 8.0, pH 7.4, or pH 5.6) with an excess of peroxoacetic acid (10-fold) or hydrogen peroxide (5- and 10-fold), directly in the 4-mm EPR tubes kept at 0 °C. The reaction was stopped by rapid immersion of the EPR tube in liquid nitrogen after 5 s. The home built high-field EPR spectrometer (95–285 GHz) has been described elsewhere (16Un S. Dorlet P. Rutherford A.W. Appl. Magn. Reson. 2001; 21: 341-361Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Electronic Absorption and Circular Dichroism Spectra—The UV-vis absorption spectra of recombinant wild-type KatG and the three variants exhibited the typical bands of a heme b-containing peroxidase in the visible and near ultraviolet region. The Soret peak was at 407 nm (in R439A at 408 nm) together with two bands around 510 and 638 nm (CT1) suggesting the presence of a dominating five-coordinate high-spin heme coexisting with a low portion of six-coordinate high-spin heme (17Heering H.A. Indiani C. Regelsberger G. Jakopitsch C. Obinger C. Smulevich G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9237-9247Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 18Santoni E. Jakopitsch C. Obinger C. Smulevich G. Biopolymers (Biospectroscopy). 2004; 74: 46-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The variant M275I has a small shoulder at about 368 nm, which could indicate the presence of some free heme. This fits well with the so-called purity number (Reinheitszahl, i.e. the ratio A406/A280), which was 0.41–0.48 for the M245I variant and 0.56–0.64 for wild-type KatG, 0.52–0.57 for R439A, and 0.46–0.52 for R439N, respectively. The yield of expression varied in the range of 30–60 mg per liter of E. coli cell culture. The spectral features of Y249F have been described recently (11Jakopitsch C. Auer M. Ivancich A. Ruker F.

Biopolymers (Biospectroscopy). 2004; 74: 46-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The CD spectra of the recombinant enzymes were typical for proteins composed predominantly of α-helices (not shown). Very little difference was observed between the CD spectra of wild-type and the three variants, indicating that there was no large scale conformational change in the structure. If conformational changes did occur, they must be very localized and minimal and thus went undetected by CD. Mass Spectrometry—Recently it has been demonstrated by Jakopitsch et al. (7Jakopitsch C. Kolarich D. Petutschnig G. Furtmuller P.G. Obinger C. FEBS Lett. 2003; 552: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) that exchange of either Trp122 or Tyr249 in Synechocystis KatG prevents formation of the KatG-specific distal side covalent adduct, whereas exchange of Met275 still allowed bond formation between Trp122 and Tyr249. In this work, we have investigated the impact of exchange of Arg439 on the formation of the adduct. If the covalent link between Trp122, Tyr249, and Met275 exists in solution, a peptide of [MH]+ with the monoisotopic mass of 7096.34 Da should have been detectable after tryptic digestion and LC/ESI-MS analysis. Fig. 2 shows the isotopic pattern of the [M5H]5+ species (1420.07 Da) found for both wild-type KatG and the R439N variant, both not for M275I. This clearly rules out the hypothesis that Arg439 takes part in the formation and/or integrity of the covalent bonds. Structural information obtained by EPR spectroscopy on the native Arg439 variants confirms these results (see below). Catalase and Peroxidase Activity—Wild-type KatG shows an overwhelming catalase activity (kcat of 3500 s-1). Upon exchange of Tyr249 by phenylalanine the enzyme was totally converted from a bifunctional peroxidase to a monofunctional peroxidase (11Jakopitsch C. Auer M. Ivancich A. Ruker F. Furtmuller P.G. Obinger C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20185-20191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Exchange of both Met275 and Arg439 also had a dramatic influence on the catalatic activity (Table I). The kcat value of the M275I was only 0.6% of wild-type, and the arginine variants retained only 3–5% of wild-type activity. There was no difference in the pH profile of catalase activity between wild-type and mutant proteins (maximum at pH 6.5).Table IApparent Km and kcat values for the catalase activity of wild-type and variant catalase-peroxidases from Synechocystis PCC 6803 Given are specific peroxidase activities (units per mg of protein).

By contrast, M275I showed a substantial increase in peroxidase activity. Compared with wild-type KatG, the peroxidase activity for the M275I variant was 8 times higher with o-dianisidine and even about 30 times higher with guaiacol (Table I). Interestingly, with both aromatic electron donors the pH maximum shifted to pH 7.0. Because in wild-type KatG, an overwhelming catalase activity strongly favors H2O2 disproportionation over the oxidation of one-electron donors, using peroxoacetic acid instead of hydrogen peroxide allowed us to directly compare the peroxidase activity of wild-type KatG and the variants. The peroxidase activity of the variants was similar to that of wild-type KatG when peroxoacetic acid was used to initiate the peroxidase reaction as shown in Table I. The typical substrate for APX, namely ascorbate, is a very poor electron donor for catalase-peroxidases, and therefore it is not possible to detect ascorbate oxidation mediated by native KatG (11Jakopitsch C. Auer M. Ivancich A. Ruker F. Furtmuller P.G. Obinger C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20185-20191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 14Jakopitsch C. Rüker F. Regelsberger G. Dockal M. Peschek G.A. Obinger C. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 1087-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, M275I and both Arg439 variants, exhibited a reasonable ascorbate-peroxidase activity, which dramatically increased with decreasing pH (not shown). By contrast, the ascorbate-peroxidase activity of Y249F was negligible. Cyanide Binding—Cyanide is often used to probe the accessibility to the distal heme cavity and thereby simulating the H2O2-mediated formation of compound I. Upon cyanide binding to heme proteins, a conversion of the ferric iron from high-spin to low-spin state is observed, as in the case of wild-type KatG and the variants, that was also accompanied by a shift of the Soret band to 422 nm and the appearance of a new prominent peak around 540 nm (Fig. 3). The cyanide complex of wild-type KatG and the arginine variants exhibited a small hypochromicity at the Soret absorbance (Fig. 3B), whereas in the case of the M275I variant a small hyperchromicity was observed (Fig. 3A). Under pseudo-first order conditions, the observed rate constant of cyanide binding to the ferric proteins linearly increased with the concentration of cyanide (Fig. 3, C and D). From the slope of the plots the apparent second order rate constant (kon) for cyanide binding was calculated to be (3.2 ± 0.2) × 105m-1 s-1 for M275I, (7.6 ± 0.3) × 105m-1 s-1 for R439A and (6.2 ± 0.2) × 105m-1 s-1 for R439N, respectively, very similar to native KatG (14Jakopitsch C. Rüker F. Regelsberger G. Dockal M. Peschek G.A. Obinger C. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 1087-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) (Table II). The finite intercept of these plots, 1.4 s-1 for M275I, 1.9 s-1 for R439A, and 3.1 s-1 for R439N represent koff. From the koff/kon ratios the dissociation constants were calculated to be 4.4 μm for M275I, 2.5 μm for R439A, and 5.1 μm for R439N. The dissociation constants of these variants decreased substantially compared with the wild-type enzyme (15.8 μm).Table IIBimolecular rate constants of compound I formation, cyanide binding, and compound I reduction for wild-type Synechocystis KatG and the variants M275I, R439A, and R439NWild-typeM275IR439AR439N× 104m-1 s-1Compound I formationHydrogen peroxiden.d.aNot detectable12.0230.3150.2Peroxoacetic acid3.930.871.144.1Cyanide binding48.431.576.161.8Compound I reductionbConditions: 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7, and 15°C.

The multiple positive feedback mechanisms operating during platelet activation have obscured the exact analysis of the roles individual G protein-mediated signaling pathways play during the platelet activation process. In this report, we show that platelets lacking Gq and G13 are completely unresponsive to diffusible stimuli such as ADP, thromboxane A2, or thrombin, even when applied at very high concentrations in combination, whereas all stimuli are able to induce platelet aggregation, shape change, and RhoA activation in platelets lacking only one Gα subunit. This shows that Gq or G13 is required to induce some platelet activation, whereas the activation of Gi-mediated signaling alone is not sufficient to induceactivation of mouse platelets. In addition, platelets lacking Gαq and Gα13 adhered normally to collagen under high shearbut did not aggregate any more in response to collagen, indicating that collagen-induced platelet activation but not platelet adhesion requires intact G protein-mediated signaling pathways.

Platelet adhesion and activation at sites of vascular injury and subsequent formation of a platelet plug is initiated by a multistep process involving the interaction of platelets with adhesive macromolecules, such as collagen and von Willebrand factor, at the subendothelial surface (1Ruggeri Z.M. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1227-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1348) Google Scholar, 2Jackson S.P. Nesbitt W.S. Kulkarni S. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2003; 1: 1602-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). The initial interaction of platelets with the extracellular matrix under the condition of high shear rates is mediated by GPIb-V-IX, which interacts with von Willebrand factor bound to subendothelial collagen (3Savage B. Almus-Jacobs F. Ruggeri Z.M. Cell. 1998; 94: 657-666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar) and induces rolling of platelets to the subendothelium. During the rolling process in particular, the collagen receptor glycoprotein VI (GPVI) 1The abbreviations used are: GPVI, glycoprotein VI; TxA2, thromboxane A2; MLC, myosin light chain.1The abbreviations used are: GPVI, glycoprotein VI; TxA2, thromboxane A2; MLC, myosin light chain. interacts with the extracellular matrix and via the FcRγ chain induces signaling pathways involving phospholipase Cγ2 and phosphoinositide-3 kinase (4Watson S.P.

Haemost. 2001; 86: 276-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). These signaling processes promote some inside-out activation of such integrins as αIIbβ3 (GPIIb-IIIa) or α2β1 (GPIa-IIa), which results in the firm adhesion of platelets to the injured vessel wall (5Nieswandt B. Watson S.P. Blood. 2003; 102: 449-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). Although collagen is able to induce some platelet activation, the recruitment of additional platelets to the growing platelet plug involves the local accumulation of diffusable mediators, which are produced or released once platelet adhesion has been initiated and some level of activation through platelet adhesion receptors has occurred (6Abrams C.S. Brass L.F. Colman R.W. Hirsh J. Marder V.J. Clowes A.W. George J.N. Hemostasis and Thrombosis. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2001: 541-559Google Scholar). These mediators include ADP/ATP and thromboxane A2 (TxA2) which are secreted or released from activated platelets as well as thrombin, which is produced on the surface of activated platelets. These platelet stimuli have in common their action through G protein-coupled receptors. Whereas ADP induces the activation of Gq and Givia P2Y1 and P2Y12 receptors (7Gachet C. Thromb.

G protein-coupled protease-activated receptors, which are activated by thrombin, are functionally coupled to Gq, G12/G13, and, in some cases, Gi (11Coughlin S.R. Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant.

Progress has recently been made using genetic mouse models in understanding the role of individual G protein-mediated signaling pathways during platelet activation. On the basis of platelets from mice lacking individual G protein α-subunits, three G proteins have been identified as major mediators of platelet activation via ADP and TxA2 receptors: Gq, Gi2, and G13 (12Yang J.

For instance, platelets lacking Gαq still undergo the platelet shape change reaction in response to various stimuli (10Klages B. Brandt U. Simon M.I. Schultz G. Offermanns S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 745-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 13Offermanns S. Toombs C.F. Hu Y.H. Simon M.I.

In the absence of Gαi2, ADP and thrombin can still induce platelet activation; however, the effects are clearly impaired and require higher ligand concentrations than in wild-type platelets (12Yang J.

Finally, lack of Gα13 in platelets severely reduces the potency of thrombin, TxA2, and collagen to induce platelet shape change and aggregation but does not render them completely unresponsive (14Moers A. Nieswandt B. Massberg S. Wettschureck N. Gruner S. Konrad I. Schulte V. Aktas B. Gratacap M.P. Simon M.I. Gawaz M. Offermanns S. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 1418-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). In the case of Gαq and Gα13 deficiency, in vivo functions are severely affected (13Offermanns S. Toombs C.F. Hu Y.H. Simon M.I. Nature. 1997; 389: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 14Moers A. Nieswandt B. Massberg S. Wettschureck N. Gruner S. Konrad I. Schulte V. Aktas B. Gratacap M.P. Simon M.I. Gawaz M. Offermanns S. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 1418-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Thus, platelet activation through G protein-coupled receptors is an integrated process that requires different G protein signaling pathways involving at least Gq, Gi, and G13. Although all three pathways seem to be required for efficient platelet activation, signaling through two of these pathways is still sufficient to induce platelet activation. To further define the minimal requirement of G protein-mediated platelet activation, we have generated platelets lacking both Gαq, and Gα13. Herein, we show that in the absence of both Gq and G13, ADP, TxA2, or thrombin can induce no platelet activation. This indicates that Gq or G13 is required to induce some platelet activation and that activation of Gi-type G proteins alone is not sufficient to activate mouse platelets. In addition, our data show that collagen-induced activation of mouse platelets resulting in platelet aggregation and thrombus formation is completely dependent on intact G protein-mediated signaling pathways.MATERIALS AND METHODSAnimals—Conditional mutant mice lacking Gαq and Gα13 were produced as described previously (14Moers A.

Offspring were intercrossed to give Mx-Cre; gnaqflox/flox; gna13flox/flox. Recombination was induced by six intraperitoneal injections of 250 μg of polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (PIPC) at 2-day intervals.Chemicals—The ATP analog AR-C69931MX was a generous gift from ASTRA Charnwood (Loughborough Leics, England). ADP, 2-methylthio-ADP, essential fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, and human fibrinogen were from Sigma (Deisenhofen, Germany). The thromboxane A2 analog U46619 was purchased from Alexis Biochemicals (Grünberg, Germany), and the fibrillar type I collagen from equine tendon was from Horm, Nycomed (Munich, Germany).Antibodies—JON/APE, which selectively binds to activated mouse αIIbβ3 integrin and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-P-selectin and control IgG antibodies (21Bergmeier W. Schulte V. Brockhoff G. Bier U. Zirngibl H. Nieswandt B. Cytometry. 2002; 48: 80-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) were from Emfret Analytics (Würzburg, Germany). Anti-Gαq/11, anti-Gα13, anti-Gαi, anti-RhoA, and anti-phosphorylated form of myosin light chain (MLC) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. The MLC antibody was from Sigma.Platelet Preparation and Aggregation—Whole blood was collected from the retro-orbital plexus in acid citrate dextrose (150 μl/ml of blood) from anesthetized mice. Blood was diluted with 0.75 of the volume of HEPES-Tyrode-buffer (137 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 12 mm NaHCO3, 0.3 mm NaH2PO4, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5.5 mm glucose, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.3) containing 0.35% bovine serum albumin. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was washed once, and optical aggregation experiments (2.5 × 108 platelets/250 μl) were conducted in a two-channel aggregometer (Chrono-Log).Flow Cytometry—Washed platelets (2 × 106) were incubated with the indicated stimuli for 2 min at 37 °C, stained with fluorophore-conjugated monoclonal antibodies (Emfret Analytics, Würzburg, Germany) at saturating concentrations for 15 min at room temperature and directly analyzed on a FACScalibur (BD Biosciences). Platelets were gated by forward scatter/sideward scatter characteristics (18Nieswandt B. Schulte V. Zywietz A. Gratacap M.P. Offermanns S. J. Biol.

Schwartz M.A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 325: 264-272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Platelets were stimulated with the indicated concentrations of stimuli for 10 s or 1 min, lysed, and subjected to GST-Rhotekin pulldown. Precipitated GTP-bound RhoA and lysates were immunoblotted with antibodies against RhoA, the MLC, or against the phosphorylated form of MLC.Flow Chamber Experiments—Experiments were performed as described previously (23Kuijpers M.J. Schulte V. Bergmeier W. Lindhout T. Brakebusch C. Offermanns S. Fassler R. Heemskerk J.W. Nieswandt B. Faseb J. 2003; 17: 685-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In brief, transparent flow chambers with a slit depth of 50 μm, equipped with Horm-type collagen-coated coverslips, were connected to a syringe filled with the anticoagulated blood. Perfusion was performed using a pulse-free pump under high shear stress equivalent to a wall shear rate of 1000 s–1 (4 min). Thereafter, chambers were rinsed by a 4-min perfusion with HEPES buffer (2 mm Ca2+) at the same shear stress, and phase-contrast images were recorded from at least five different microscopic fields (40× objectives). Shown are images representative of five to eight experiments per group.RESULTSIn platelets lacking Gα13 but not Gα12, TxA2 has a severely reduced potency to induce platelet shape change and aggregation (14Moers A. Nieswandt B. Massberg S. Wettschureck N. Gruner S. Konrad I. Schulte V. Aktas B. Gratacap M.P. Simon M.I. Gawaz M. Offermanns S. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 1418-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). However, the potency of ADP to induce shape change and aggregation is not affected by the absence of Gα13, whereas it is abrogated in Gαq-deficient platelets (Fig. 1, a–c). This indicates that platelet ADP receptors do not employ Gα13 and that platelet activation in response to ADP can be induced through Gq and Gi, which are activated by P2Y1 and P2Y12 receptors, respectively. This is consistent with the finding that high concentrations of other stimuli such as TxA2 and thrombin can induce platelet activation also in the absence of Gα13 (14Moers A. Nieswandt B. Massberg S. Wettschureck N. Gruner S. Konrad I. Schulte V. Aktas B. Gratacap M.P. Simon M.I. Gawaz M. Offermanns S. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 1418-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). However, as shown in Fig. 1d, the effect of the TxA2 mimetic U46619 on Gα13-deficient platelets but not on wild-type platelets is sensitive to apyrase, which degrades ADP released from U46619-activated platelets via Gq-mediated signaling pathways (24Paul B.Z. Jin J. Kunapuli S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29108-29114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). TxA2, which does not directly activate Gi through its receptor, has been shown to require P2Y12 receptor-mediated Gi activation by ADP for full platelet activation (25Jin J. Kunapuli S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8070-8074Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that in the absence of Gα13, the remaining Gq-mediated signaling of the TxA2 receptor alone is not sufficient to induce irreversible platelet activation unless Gi is concomitantly activated via released ADP.To further analyze the role of G13 and to test whether there is any platelet activation in the absence of both Gα13 and Gαq, we generated platelets deficient in both α subunits. To do so, we generated mice that were homozygous for the floxed alleles of the Gα13 and Gαq genes (14Moers A. Nieswandt B. Massberg S. Wettschureck N. Gruner S. Konrad I. Schulte V. Aktas B. Gratacap M.P. Simon M.I. Gawaz M. Offermanns S. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 1418-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 20Wettschureck N. Rutten H. Zywietz A. Gehring D. Wilkie T.M. Chen J. Chien K.R. Offermanns S. Nat.

Schwenk F. Aguet M. Rajewsky K. Science. 1995; 269: 1427-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (1523) Google Scholar). Deletion of both the Gαq and Gα13 genes was induced by intraperitoneal injections of PIPC. Four weeks after the last PIPC injection no Gαq and Gα13 protein was detectable in platelets prepared from these animals (Fig. 2a). Thrombin and U46619 can still induce shape change responses in Gαq-deficient platelets and at higher concentrations induce shape change and aggregation in the absence of Gα13 (13Offermanns S. Toombs C.F. Hu Y.H. Simon M.I. Nature. 1997; 389: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 14Moers A. Nieswandt B. Massberg S. Wettschureck N. Gruner S. Konrad I. Schulte V. Aktas B. Gratacap M.P. Simon M.I. Gawaz M. Offermanns S. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 1418-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). However, in platelets lacking both α subunits, there was no response to both stimuli even at maximal concentrations (Fig. 2, b and c). In Gαq-deficient platelets, integrin αIIbβ3 activation could be induced when thrombin or U46619 are given together with an agent that induces strong Gi activation, such as ADP, acting through the P2Y12 receptor at high concentration (18Nieswandt B. Schulte V. Zywietz A. Gratacap M.P. Offermanns S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39493-39498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). However, platelets lacking both Gαq and Gα13 were completely unresponsive, even when exposed to 100 μm ADP together with maximal concentrations of thrombin or U46619 (Fig. 2, d and e). This shows that Gq and G13 are required for platelet activation and that the activation of Gi-mediated signaling pathways alone is not sufficient to induce platelet aggregation.Fig. 2Effect of various platelet stimuli on aggregation of platelets lacking Gαq and Gα13.

Wild-type platelets (wt) as well as platelets lacking Gαq (q–/–), Gα13 (13–/–), or both Gαq and Gα13 (q–/–), were incubated with maximally active concentrations of U46619 and thrombin alone (b and c) or together with 100 μm ADP (d and e).

Blood. 1999; 94: 1665-1672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this, RhoA activation and MLC phosphorylation in response to U46619 is not changed in platelets lacking Gαq, which still undergo normal platelet shape change (29Gratacap M.P. Payrastre B. Nieswandt B. Offermanns S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47906-47913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In Gα13-deficient platelets, the potency of U46619 to induce RhoA activation and MLC phosphorylation is severely reduced (14Moers A. Nieswandt B. Massberg S. Wettschureck N. Gruner S. Konrad I. Schulte V. Aktas B. Gratacap M.P. Simon M.I. Gawaz M. Offermanns S. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 1418-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). However, high concentrations of U46619 induce some level of RhoA activation and MLC phosphorylation also in the absence of Gα13 (Fig. 3, a and b). The small remaining RhoA activation and MLC phosphorylation was not mediated by G12 as platelets lacking both Gα12 and Gα13 were indistinguishable from Gα13-deficient platelets (Fig. 3, a and b). In contrast, platelets lacking both Gαq and Gα13 did not respond at all with RhoA activation and MLC phosphorylation even to very high concentrations of agonists (Fig. 3, a and b). This indicates that at low agonist concentrations, RhoA activation is induced via G13, whereas Gq can mediate RhoA activation in response to high agonist concentrations. The activation of Gi alone is not sufficient to induce RhoA activation and subsequent MLC phosphorylation. Consistent with this, exposure of Gαq-deficient platelets to ADP, which is only able to activate Gi-mediated signaling in the absence of Gαq, induced neither RhoA activation nor MLC phosphorylation. However, wild-type platelets showed strong RhoA activation and MLC phosphorylation in response to ADP (Fig. 3, c and d).Fig. 3Effects of U46619 and 2MeSADP on RhoA activation and myosin light-chain phosphorylation in Gα-deficient platelets. Wild-type platelets, Gαq-deficient (q–/–), Gα13-deficient (13–/–), Gα12/Gα13 double-deficient platelets (12–/–;13–/–), and Gαq/Gα13 double-deficient platelets (q–/–;13/–) were incubated with increasing concentrations of U46619 (a and b) for 10 s. c and d, wild-type- and Gαq-deficient (q–/–) platelets were incubated with increasing concentrations of 2-merthylthio-ADP for 1 min. Activated RhoA was precipitated as described under “Materials and Methods” (a and c), and the amount of phosphorylated MLC (b and d) was determined using a phosphorylation site-specific antibody (see “Materials and Methods”). Shown are Western blots of the platelet lysates (lysates) or GST-RBD precipitates (pull-down) using the indicated antibodies (IB). Data shown are representative of at least three independently performed experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fibrillar collagen is an insoluble molecule that, in solution, comes in contact only with a small fraction of platelets (30Nieswandt B. Brakebusch C. Bergmeier W. Schulte V. Bouvard D. Mokhtari-Nejad R. Lindhout T. Heemskerk J.W. Zirngibl H. Fässler R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2120-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Its primary signaling through the platelet collagen receptor GPVI/FcRγ results in platelet activation, which is not affected by the absence of Gαq (18Nieswandt B. Schulte V. Zywietz A. Gratacap M.P. Offermanns S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39493-39498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 30Nieswandt B. Brakebusch C. Bergmeier W. Schulte V. Bouvard D.

Flow cytometric analysis of single platelets in diluted suspensions under conditions that largely exclude the accumulation of released mediators show that only about 11% of wild-type platelets are directly activated by collagen at high concentrations (50 μg/ml). This primary activation of a subpopulation of platelets by fibrillar collagen in solution was also not affected by the absence of both Gαq and Gα13 (Fig. 4). Likewise, the initial adhesion of Gαq- as well as Gαq/Gα13-deficient platelets during perfusion of whole blood over collagen under high shear conditions ex vivo was indistinguishable from that observed in wild-type platelets (Fig. 5). This shows that adhesion of platelets to collagen and the direct activation of a platelet subpopulation by collagen fibrils acting through GPVI is independent of G protein-mediated signaling. However, the formation of stable thrombi under high shear conditions was severely impaired in the absence of Gαq and Gα13, and no thrombi could be observed after rinsing the chamber (Fig. 5), as recently also shown even for platelets lacking Gα13 alone (14Moers A. Nieswandt B. Massberg S. Wettschureck N. Gruner S. Konrad I. Schulte V. Aktas B. Gratacap M.P. Simon M.I. Gawaz M. Offermanns S. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 1418-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). These data indicate that a small fraction of platelets is activated by collagen directly, resulting in firm adhesion of platelets to collagen, and that the subsequent release of soluble mediators (such as ADP, TxA2, and other stimuli that act through G protein-coupled receptors) are required for the formation of stable platelet aggregates.Fig. 4Collagen-induced activation of Gαq- and Gαq/Gα13-deficient platelets. Washed platelets (2 × 106/50 μl) from wild-type (wt), Gαq-deficient (q–/–) or Gαq/Gα13 double-deficient platelets (q–/–;13–/–) were stimulated with collagen (50 μg/ml) for 2 min at 37 °C, stained with fluorophore-labeled antibodies for 15 min and directly analyzed on a FACScalibur.

Low collagen concentrations were unable to induce aggregation in Gαq-deficient and Gαq/Gα13 double-deficient platelets. However, in the absence of Gαq, high collagen concentrations induce shape change and aggregation (18Nieswandt B. Schulte V. Zywietz A. Gratacap M.P. Offermanns S. J. Biol.

In contrast, platelets lacking Gαq and Gα13 showed only a very small aggregation response to high collagen concentrations. This effect was not affected by the P2Y12 receptor antagonist AR-C69931MX, indicating that the very small remaining aggregation is not mediated by ADP release from collagen-stimulated platelets but may be the result of a small fraction of platelets activated by collagen directly through GPVI (Fig. 4). The unresponsiveness of Gαq/Gα13-deficient platelets to collagen in aggregation experiments was accompanied by a complete lack of RhoA activation and MLC phosphorylation (Fig. 6, d and e). These data indicate that although a subpopulation of platelets can be directly activated by fibrillar collagen, aggregation of platelets in suspension and platelet thrombus formation under h"

This model has gained acceptance as a general framework with recently suggested modifications and refinements (4Van Veen H.W. Margolles A. Muller M. Higgins C.F. Konings W.N.

We have proposed that ATP initially binds to each of the NBDs while Pgp is in the open conformation, and then the NBDs approach each other to form an integrated structure, the closed conformation, in which catalytic side chains required to stabilize the ATP hydrolysis transition state complex are made available from both NBDs. After hydrolysis of ATP coupled to drug movement from inner membrane leaflet to the outer side of the membrane, the NBDs dissociate to re-form the open conformation and then release the ADP product (6Urbatsch I.L.

Nature. 1998; 396: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar) and later in several other x-ray structures, it was apparent that a conserved Glu residue immediately adjacent to and downstream of the conserved “Walker B” Asp residue might provide the same catalytic carboxylate function in ABC transporter NBDs.A mutagenesis screen of carboxylate residues by Urbatsch et al. (28Urbatsch I.L. Julien M. Carrier I. Rousseau M.E. Cayrol R. Gros P. Ruysschaert J.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14138-14149Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) underscored the importance of the highly conserved, putative catalytic carboxylate residues Glu-552 and Glu-1197 in mouse MDR3 Pgp. Mutagenesis of either residue to Gln yielded Pgp with strongly impaired drug transport and ATPase activities, although mutant proteins did show orthovanadate (Vi)-induced trapping of 8-azido-ADP upon incubation with 8-azido-ATP and Vi, suggesting that at least one turnover of 8-azido-ATP hydrolysis as far as the Pi release step was occurring. Urbatsch et al. (28Urbatsch I.L. Julien M. Carrier I. Rousseau M.E. Cayrol R. Gros P. Ruysschaert J.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14138-14149Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) proposed that in the mutants release of product ADP was unusually slow (28Urbatsch I.L. Julien M. Carrier I. Rousseau M.E. Cayrol R. Gros P. Ruysschaert J.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14138-14149Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Later studies from the same laboratory indicated that mutants E552Q and E1197Q induce asymmetric conformations of the two NBDs (29Vigano C. Julien M. Carrier I. Gros P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5008-5016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 30Carrier I. Julien M. Gros P. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12875-12885Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Sauna et al. (31Sauna Z.E. Müller M. Peng X.H. Ambudkar S.V. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13989-14000Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) studied the equivalent conserved glutamates in human MDR1 Pgp, introducing Gln and Ala mutations. Consistent with the earlier data, both drug transport and ATPase activity were strongly impaired in mutant proteins, and Vi-induced trapping of 8-azido-ADP was seen. However, these workers differed from Urbatsch et al. (28Urbatsch I.L. Julien M. Carrier I. Rousseau M.E. Cayrol R. Gros P. Ruysschaert J.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14138-14149Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) as to the impact of the mutations, concluding that a second round of ATP hydrolysis, required to “reset” the drug-binding sites after an initial outward transport-generating ATPase turnover, was blocked. Sauna et al. (31Sauna Z.E. Müller M. Peng X.H. Ambudkar S.V. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13989-14000Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) also found that when Ala or Gln mutations were introduced simultaneously into both NBDs, the resultant double mutants showed Vi-independent occlusion of 8-azido-ADP upon incubation with 8-azido-ATP along with loss of ATPase and drug transport.In a recent study we further characterized nucleotide binding and hydrolysis properties of pure mouse MDR3 Pgp in which Glu residues at both positions 552 and 1197 were simultaneously substituted with Ala, Gln, Asp, or Lys (32Tombline G. Bartholomew L.A. Urbatsch I.L. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31212-31220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Using a sensitive radioactive assay, we found that the mutants displayed real but very low ATPase activity and that inability to form the normal transition state, rather than slow ADP release, was the primary defect. Both E552Q/E1197Q and E552A/E1197A mutants were able to bind MgATP and MgADP with high affinity, suggesting that they were trapped in the closed conformation of Pgp, which, we propose, occurs immediately before the hydrolytic step (see above).Therefore it was apparent that mutations of the catalytic carboxylate glutamate residues in Pgp have the potential to clarify several aspects of mechanism. Here we present detailed studies of effects of mutations Glu to Gln, Ala, Asp, or Lys, present singly in either NBD, using pure mouse MDR3 protein and the naturally occurring ligands MgATP and MgADP. First we evaluated two previous suggestions, namely that ADP release (28Urbatsch I.L. Julien M. Carrier I. Rousseau M.E. Cayrol R. Gros P. Ruysschaert J.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14138-14149Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) or a second round of ATPase turnover (31Sauna Z.E. Müller M. Peng X.H. Ambudkar S.V. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13989-14000Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) is defective in Gln mutants. Second, we extended the studies using Ala, Asp, and Lys mutants. Third, we combined the mutations S528A and S1173A, involving mutations of the conserved Ser residue in the “LSGGQ” ABC signature sequence of NBD1 or NBD2, with the catalytic carboxylate E552A mutation of NBD1 to assess the effects of mutations “in cis” or “in trans” at the putative NBD dimer interface.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—[8-14C]ADP and [α-32P]ATP were purchased from Perkin Elmer Life Sciences. Escherichia coli lipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids.Construction of Mutant Mouse MDR3 Pgp, Expression of Mutant Pgp in Pichia pastoris, and Purification and Quantitation of Pgp—P. pastoris strains expressing E552Q and E1197Q mutant mouse MDR3 Pgp were generous gifts of Professor Philippe Gros and Dr. Isabel Carrier (McGill University). Other mutations at positions Glu-552 and Glu-1197 were generated by PCR mutagenesis as described previously (32Tombline G. Bartholomew L.A. Urbatsch I.L. Senior A.E. J. Biol.

All mutant proteins contained a C-terminal His6 tag and were expressed in P. pastoris and purified as described previously (32Tombline G. Bartholomew L.A. Urbatsch I.L. Senior A.E. J. Biol.

Protein concentration was determined by reference to a standard calibrated by amino acid analysis as described previously (33Tombline G. Bartholomew L.A. Gimi K. Tyndall G.A. Senior A.E. J. Biol.

Briefly Pgp was activated by preincubation with 8 mm DTT and E. coli lipids at ratio of 50:1 (for ATPase measurement) or 2:1 (for nucleotide-trapping experiments). Release of [32P]Pi from [γ-32P]ATP was determined using the charcoal (Norit) adsorption assay using 0.5–1 μg of activated Pgp. When present, verapamil (150 μm) was added directly to the ATPase assay buffer. Km(MgATP) and Ki(MgADP) were determined as in Refs. 32Tombline G. Bartholomew L.A. Urbatsch I.L. Senior A.E. J. Biol.

Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5363-5373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Briefly the trapping procedure entailed preincubation of Pgp (5–10 μg) with 200 μm [α-32P]ATP or 100 μm [8-14C]ADP, 200 μm Vi, and 2 mm MgSO4, with or without 150 μm verapamil, at 37 °C for 20 min (with ATP) or 120 min (with ADP) followed by centrifuge column elution to separate bound from free ligands and counting of eluates to determine bound nucleotide. Identification of the trapped nucleotide (ATP versus ADP) was by TLC analysis (32Tombline G. Bartholomew L.A. Urbatsch I.L. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31212-31220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Rate of onset of trapping was carried out at room temperature to slow the reaction sufficiently to allow accurate determination. Rate of release of trapped nucleotide was measured by allowing centrifuge column eluates to incubate for varied times at 37 °C and then passing the eluates through a second centrifuge column to determine remaining bound nucleotide. Where sequential rounds of Vi trapping were carried out the procedure was modified as follows. In the first round of Vi trapping, 90 μg of activated Pgp was incubated in 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EGTA, 2.5% glycerol, 8 mm DTT, 4 mm MgSO4 with 150 μm verapamil, 200 μm [α-32P]ATP, and 200 μm Vi at 37 °C for 20 min in a total volume of 200 μl. Samples were placed on ice for 2 min, and then 2 × 100-μl aliquots were passed through centrifuge columns at 4 °C that were pre-equilibrated with 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 10 mm DTT. The eluates were combined and quickly counted by the Cerenkov method, and a 10-μl sample was removed for protein quantitation. MgATP was added to a concentration of 1 mm. The eluates were then incubated at 37 °C for 180 min (wild type and E552Q) or 90 min (E1197Q) to allow release of trapped nucleotide. Next samples were placed on ice for 2 min followed by passage through a centrifuge column equilibrated as above. After quickly counting by the Cerenkov method, 5 μl was removed for protein quantitation. For the second round of Vi trapping, the remaining sample was incubated under conditions identical to the first round of trapping in 100-μl total volume at 37 °C for 20 min. Samples were then placed on ice for 2 min followed by passage through centrifuge columns at 4 °C. Eluates were counted by the Cerenkov method, and protein was quantitated. It was noted that Pgp (wild type or mutant) lost activity if DTT or ATP was omitted at any of the centrifuge column steps.RESULTSAs remarked in the Introduction, there is agreement that the conserved Glu residues (Glu-552 and Glu-1197 in mouse MDR3 Pgp) that lie immediately adjacent and C-terminal to the Walker B Asp residues in the NBDs are catalytically important in P-glycoprotein. However, authors of previous studies differed as to the proposed mechanism by which mutations to Gln impaired function (28Urbatsch I.L. Julien M. Carrier I. Rousseau M.E. Cayrol R. Gros P. Ruysschaert J.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14138-14149Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 31Sauna Z.E. Müller M. Peng X.H. Ambudkar S.V. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13989-14000Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Here we further studied the roles of these Glu residues. First we re-evaluated the earlier conclusions. Second, we made mutations to Ala, Asp, and Lys, and we compared data obtained with these mutants. Third, we combined the E552A mutation in the N-terminal NBD with a mutation Ser to Ala in the LSGGQ ABC signature sequence of either the N-terminal or the C-terminal NBD. Pure mouse MDR3 Pgp obtained from P. pastoris grown in fermenter culture was used throughout. Yields of all mutant proteins were the same as for wild-type Pgp. All purified proteins showed a single band on SDS gels as for example in Ref. 33Tombline G. Bartholomew L.A. Gimi K. Tyndall G.A. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5363-5373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar.Effects of E552Q and E1197Q MutationsATPase Activity—Pgp containing E552Q and E1197Q mutations in the N- and C-terminal NBDs, respectively, was purified and activated with lipids and DTT. ATPase activity was measured using [γ-32P]ATP in a sensitive charcoal adsorption assay. Results are shown in Fig. 1, A and B (note differences in vertical axes). Calculated turnover rates are given in Table I with wild-type enzyme assayed under the same conditions shown for comparison. Duplicate purifications of each mutant enzyme gave the same results. Contrary to previous results (28Urbatsch I.L. Julien M. Carrier I. Rousseau M.E. Cayrol R. Gros P. Ruysschaert J.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14138-14149Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 31Sauna Z.E. Müller M. Peng X.H. Ambudkar S.V. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13989-14000Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) we found that both E552Q and E1197Q mutants undergo multiple turnovers during the time course of the assay (contrast these data with the zero or close to zero activity of mutant E552A/S528A shown in Fig. 6B also reproduced in duplicate Pgp purifications). Moreover there was apparent “asymmetry” in that the mutation in the C-terminal NBD (E1197Q) was more impairing than the one in the N-terminal domain (E552Q) in regard to turnover and drug stimulation. As with wild type, both mutant enzymes showed activation and then inhibition when titrated with increasing concentrations of verapamil (data not shown). The concentration of verapamil yielding maximal activity was ∼150 μm for all three enzymes. Vi potently inhibited wild-type and both mutant enzymes. IC50 values were: wild-type, 3 μm; E552Q, 0.1 μm; E1197Q, 0.2 μm (data not shown). The enhanced apparent affinity for Vi in mutants is consistent with previous work (30Carrier I. Julien M. Gros P. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12875-12885Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Km values were calculated from plots of ATPase activity versus MgATP concentration (Fig. 2) and are given in Table I. Since for technical reasons the maximal ATP concentration used was 2 mm, which was insufficient to reach saturation in Fig. 2, A and B, these values are apparent only. However, they are useful for comparisons, showing that both mutants had lower Km values than wild type with E1197Q producing a larger effect.Table IATPase activity, Km(MgATP), and Ki(MgADP) values for E552Q and E1197Q mutantsPgpATPase activityaTurnover rate with -fold stimulation by 150 μm verapamil in parentheses.

It is seen that the E552Q and E1197Q mutants were not very different from wild type, indicating that ADP binding affinity is not significantly altered by the mutations.Release and Formation of Vi-trapped ADP—Fig. 3 shows release of [α-32P]ADP after prior trapping with Vi and [α-32P]ATP. Rates and half-times for release are shown in Table II (columns three and four). The data for wild type (t½ = 77 min) are in good agreement with previous reports (32Tombline G. Bartholomew L.A.

Release of ADP was faster in the E1197Q mutant (t½ = 17 min) than in wild type, whereas E552Q (t½ = 60 min) was similar to wild type. Formation of Vi-trapped ADP was faster in both mutants as compared with wild type (Table II, column one) consistent with more potent inhibition of ATPase by Vi (above). Trapped Vi-ADP is thought to mimic a transition state of ATP hydrolysis, therefore one may conclude that the mutations have altered the nature of the transition state but have not abolished it.Fig. 3Rate of release of Vi-trapped [α-32P]ADP by E552Q and E1197Q mutants.

Colon cancer, often diagnosed at an advanced stage, is generally treated by surgical resection followed by adjuvant treatment with 5-fluorouracil plus leucovorin (1Wils J. O'Dwyer P. Labianca R. Ann. Oncol. 2001; 12: 13-22Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, because only 26% of patients respond, the need for improved therapies is pressing. Oxaliplatin, a platinum agent that directly damages DNA, and irinotecan, an inhibitor of topoisomerase I, are currently in clinical trial for colon cancer and are showing some significant activity and promise (2Falcone A. Masi G. Allegrini G. Danesi R. Pfanner E. Brunetti I.M. Di Paolo A. Cupini S. Del Tacca M. Conte P. J. Clin. Oncol. 2002; 20: 4006-4014Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The cellular response to anticancer drugs is dependent on molecules that couple drug-induced damage to those that regulate the engagement of apoptosis (3Dive C. Hickman J.A. Br. J.

Indeed, the suppression of apoptosis is one of the six hallmarks of cancer (5Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22075) Google Scholar). Several oncogenes and mutated tumor suppressor genes relevant to colon cancer, such as Kirsten (Ki) Ras and p53, modulate the threshold for drug-induced apoptosis, prompting drug discovery programs directed at these molecules and at the pathways that they regulate (6Workman P. Kaye S.B. Trends Mol. Med. 2002; 8: S1-S9Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The non-receptor-tyrosine kinase c-Src is overexpressed in >70% of human colon cancers (7Cartwright C.A. Gastroenterology. 1998; 114: 1335-1338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 8Frame M.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1602: 114-130PubMed Google Scholar), and recent studies suggest that its activity may also modulate apoptosis (9Webb B.L. Jimenez E. Martin G.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9271-9280Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 10Johnson D. Agochiya M. Samejima K. Earnshaw W. Frame M. Wyke J. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 8: 685-696Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Cellular Src (c-Src) is ubiquitously expressed, and its activity is tightly controlled in healthy cells. It is normally inactivated via phosphorylation of tyrosine 527 by C-terminal Src kinase (11Young M.A. Gonfloni S. Superti-Furga G. Roux B. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2001; 105: 115-126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated Tyr-527 binds its own SH2 domain, which is tightly coupled to its SH3 domain, and this inhibits kinase activity (the closed conformation). Activating c-Src involves both dephosphorylation at Tyr-527 (e.g. by protein-tyrosine phosphatase PTPα) or the binding of tyrosine-phosphorylated cellular proteins to the SH2 domain to destabilize the phosphorylated Tyr-527 intermolecular interaction with the SH2 domain (12Cam W.R. Masaki T. Shiratori Y. Kato N. Ikenoue T. Okamoto M. Igarashi K. Sano T. Omata M. Cancer. 2001; 92: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These events allow c-Src to adopt an open conformation that results in autophosphorylation at Tyr-416 and c-Src kinase activity. C-terminal Src kinase is down-regulated in a subset of human colon cancers, providing one mechanism explaining the high activity of c-Src in this disease (11Young M.A. Gonfloni S. Superti-Furga G. Roux B. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2001; 105: 115-126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), and c-Src is mutated and activated in a subset of late-stage colon cancer (13Irby R.B.

The roles c-Src plays in signaling changes in cellular adhesion and motility together with its ability to promote proliferation are well established (14Martin G.S. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Studies carried out in transformed fibroblasts expressing the viral homologue v-Src suggest that activated Src can signal cell survival via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Ras-dependent pathways but can also prime for apoptosis via an unknown mechanism (9Webb B.L.

Cell Death Differ. 2000; 8: 685-696Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Shp-2 has been shown not only to be necessary for morphological transformation by v-Src but also for activation of AKT via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (17Hakak Y. Hsu Y.S. Martin G.S.

These studies suggest a connection between Src-mediated STAT3 phosphorylation and bcl-xL transcription, although there is no direct evidence to link the two events. Here we assess the impact of expressing kinase-defective mutants of c-Src on drug-induced apoptosis in human metastatic colon cancer cells in vitro. KM12L4A metastatic human colon cancer cells were provided by Dr. I. Fidler (MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas). The CA10-Src251GFP 1The abbreviations used are: GFP, green fluorescent protein; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; FADD, FAS-associated death domain protein. expression vector (a gift from P. Schwartzberg, NIH, Bethesda, MD) was introduced into KM12L4A cells using SuperFect transfection reagent (Qiagen, Crawley, UK). Stable cells to generate (KM12L4A Src251) were selected with 200 μg/ml hygromycin (Roche Diagnostics). pBABEpuro-SrcMF and pBABEpuro-SrcMF with function-blocking point mutations in the SH2 (R175L) or SH3 domain (W118A) were introduced as above, and stable clones termed KM12L4A SrcMF-10, KM12L4A Src MFR, and KM12L4A Src MFW, respectively, were selected in 1 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma). Cells were cultured in Eagle's minimal essential medium with Ear le's salts supplemented with minimal essential medium vitamins (×2), non-essential amino acids, l-glutamine 2 mm, and sodium pyruvate (1 mm) (all from Invitrogen) in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum. All cells were routinely maintained in log phase in a humidified incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Oxaliplatin was purchased from Alexis Biochemicals (Nottingham, UK) and was dissolved at 12.5 mm in sterile phosphate-buffered saline. SN38 was from Aventis Pharma (West Malling, UK) and was dissolved in Me2SO (2 mm). Caspase inhibitors IETD CHO and DEVD CHO, the c-Src destabilizing agent herbimycin A, and the Src kinase inhibitor PP2 were from Calbiochem and were dissolved in Me2SO as stock solutions. In selected experiments cell monolayers were washed, and medium containing freshly prepared PP2 at 100 nm–10 μm was added daily for up to 72 h. Low concentrations of PP2 were used to minimize potential inhibition of other kinases (23Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J.

Detached and adherent cells were collected and pelleted, cell pellets were resuspended in Vectorshield® containing 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories, Burlington, CA) before examination of nuclear morphology by fluorescent microscopy. Apoptotic cells were identified with nuclear condensation and fragmentation. The {2,3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-5[(phenylamino)carbonyl]-2H-tetrazolum hydroxide} assay was performed as previously described (24Scudiero D.A. Shoemaker R.H. Paull K.D. Monks A. Tierney S. Nofziger T.H. Currens M.J. Seriff D. Boyd M.R. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 4827-4833PubMed Google Scholar). For clonogenic assays, cells were seeded at 5 × 103 cells/well in a 6-well plate and allowed to adhere overnight. Medium was removed and replaced with warm, fresh medium or medium containing 50 or 100 μm oxaliplatin, and cells were left at 37 °C for 1 h. After incubation, medium was removed, cells were washed once in medium, and fresh medium was replenished. Cells were left to grow for 10–14 days after which colonies were fixed in 70% methanol, stained with methylene blue, photographed, and scored using Total Lab colony counter v1.11 from Phoretix (Newcastle, UK). Detached and adherent cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in 70% ethanol, incubated with RNase, and stained with propidium iodide, and DNA content was analyzed by flow cytometry as previously described (25Ormerod M. Flow Cytometry: A Practical Approach. 3rd Ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford, New York2000Google Scholar, 26.Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar). Total Intracellular Platinum Levels—Control and oxaliplatin-treated cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline to remove unreacted drug and then harvested by centrifugation. Cell pellets (1 × 106 cells) were resuspended in ice-cold deionized distilled H20. 90 μl of sonicated sample was solubilized with 10 μl of 10 m NaOH (Sigma) and incubated at 60 °C for 1 h, whereas 10 μl was retained for protein quantification. 900 μl of 1 m HNO3 was added, and samples were incubated at 70 °C overnight and then stored at -20 °C before inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry analysis. HNO3 was SpectrosoL grade (69%, BDH) and diluted 1:20 in deionized distilled H2O for a final concentration of 1 m. Oxaliplatin DNA Adducts—DNA extraction was performed using the Qiagen Genomic-tip system according to the manufacturer's protocol. Lysed pellets were sonicated after the addition of buffer G2 and subjected to RNase digestion for 45 min at 37 °C before digestion with proteinase K for 1 h at 50 °C. Quantification of DNA was performed by UV-visible spectrophotometry with ratios of A260 nm/A280 nm of 1.8. To aliquots of DNA solution, equal volumes of nitric acid (7% w/v) were added, and the solutions then incubated at 70 °C for 18 h before analysis. Whole cell lysates were diluted with nitric acid (3.5% w/v) to give platinum concentrations appropriate for analysis. The platinum contents of these preparations were analyzed on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Sciex Elan 6000 inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer using a standard cross-flow nebulizer and Scott-type double-pass spray chamber. The method involved monitoring four isotopes of platinum (194Pt, 195Pt, 196Pt, 198Pt) and correction for isobaric interferences from mercury as described previously (25Ormerod M. Flow Cytometry: A Practical Approach. 3rd Ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford, New York2000Google Scholar). Platinum concentrations were derived with reference to a standard solution calibration curve and are the mean of the concentrations derived from monitoring of the 194Pt, 195Pt, and 196Pt isotopes. Total cellular proteins (25 μg) from whole cell lysates were subjected to Western blotting as previously described. Blots were probed or reprobed with the antibodies to caspases (caspase 8, Ab-3, or caspase 3, Ab-1, Calbiochem) to Bcl-xL (catalog #610211, BD Transduction Laboratories, Franklin, NJ), and to Src family kinases Src (Ab-1, Oncogene Research, Calbiochem) Fyn (catalog # 06-133, Upstate Biotechnology, Charlottesville, VA), and Yes (catalog #06-514, Upstate Biotechnology, Charlottesville, VA). Bound antibody was detected using Enhanced Chemiluminescence Reagent (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Activation of c-Src was assessed in three ways. First, a phospho-specific antibody reactive with the 416 phosphorylated form of c-Src (catalog #44-660, BIOSOURCE International, Inc., Camarillo, CA) was used to assess c-Src activation status. Second, the effect of c-Src phosphorylation of its substrate paxillin was assessed. Cell extracts were prepared in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS), and paxillin immunoprecipitates were prepared from 1 mg of protein with 4 μg of anti-paxillin antibody (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY). Immunocomplexes were collected using protein A-Sepharose and washed extensively with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Proteins were resolved by 7% SDS-PAGE gels before transfer to nitrocellulose membranes and probed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (pY20, Transduction Laboratories). Blots were subsequently stripped and reprobed with anti-paxillin antibody (27Jones R.J. Avizienyte E. Wyke A.W. Brunton V.G. Frame M.C. Br. J. Cancer. 2002; 87: 1128-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Last, c-Src kinase activity was assessed using a standard in vitro kinase assay using a kit from Upstate Biotechnology according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reduction of c-Src Kinase Activity in KM12L4A Cells by Stably Expressing Kinase-defective Mutants of c-Src— KM12L4A cells were stably transfected with two forms of kinase-defective c-Src, and stable clones were isolated. KM12L4A-SrcMF-10 cells (termed MF-10 hereafter) expressed c-Src with point mutations K295M and Y527F that encoded a kinase-defective molecule in the open conformation (Fig. 1A). KM12L4A SrcMFW and KM12L4A Src MFR contain additional function blocking point mutations in their SH3 or SH2 domains, respectively (see Fig. 1A) and are hereafter termed MFW and MFR. KML12L4A Src251GFP-6 and KM12L4A Src251GFP-13 are two independent clones expressing a truncated c-Src-GFP fusion protein that encoded for the first 251 amino acids of c-Src containing the unique domain and the SH3-SH2 domains but without the catalytic domain (hereafter referred to as 251-6 and 251-13). All of the results obtained with 251-6 were consistently reproduced in 251-13 (not all of the data are shown for 251-13). The increased levels of c-Src protein are shown in the cells overexpressing the kinase-defective forms (251-6, MF10, MFW, and MFR) (Fig. 1B). The activity of endogenous c-Src in these cell lines was assessed using two different methods. First, the phosphorylation status of the Src substrate paxillin was examined using a phospho-specific antibody. This showed a decrease in Paxillin phosphorylation in cells expressing MF-10 and 251-6 compared with the empty vector control (Fig. 1C, i and ii). Second and confirming these results, c-Src was immunoprecipitated, and its activity was assessed using an in vitro kinase assay (Fig. 1Ciii). There was decreased Src kinase activity in cells expressing either kinase-defective mutant compared with the vector controls. No compensatory rise in the protein expression levels of other Src family members Fyn and Yes was observed after expression of the kinase-defective c-Src mutants (Fig. 1D). Expression of c-Src Kinase-defective Mutants Increased Sensitivity to Oxaliplatin Downstream of Drug-induced Damage— The response of MF-10 and 251-6 (and 251-13, not shown) to oxaliplatin in vitro was assessed by 3 day {2,3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-5[(phenylamino)carbonyl]-2H-tetrazolumhydroxide} viability assay (Fig. 2A) and by the number of detached cells with apoptotic nuclear morphology (Fig. 2B and inset) compared with that observed for empty vector controls. Expression of both types of kinase-defective c-Src decreased the concentration of oxaliplatin required to reduce viable cell number by 50% (IC50). The IC50 values were 75 μm for MF-10, 90 μm for 251-6, 118 μm for 251-13, and 180 μm for empty vector controls. These data were mirrored by a pronounced increase in the percentage of apoptotic cells in KM12L4A clones expressing the kinase-defective forms of c-Src 24–72h after treatment with oxaliplatin (150 μm). Expression of both types of kinase-defective c-Src also reduced the IC50 concentrations for cisplatin that were 70 μm for MF-10, 251-6 and 251-13 and 90 μm for empty vector controls. The increased sensitivity of MF-10 and 251-6 cells to oxaliplatin in comparison with vector controls was also observed in a clonogenic assay; oxaliplatin-treated MF-10 and 251-6 cells displayed 33 and 21% clonogenicity relative to untreated cells (taken as 100%). In comparison, oxaliplatin treatment resulted in 76.9% clonogenicity relative to untreated vector control cells (Fig. 2C). To determine whether the enhanced sensitivity to oxaliplatin mediated by kinase-defective c-Src was upstream or downstream of oxaliplatin-induced cellular damage, we examined changes in the cell cycle (Table I), the cellular uptake of oxaliplatin (Fig. 3A), and the degree of DNA damage inflicted (Fig. 3B). Oxaliplatin treatment resulted in a similar decrease in cells in G1 accompanied by increased S phase cells at 24 h in vector controls, MF-10, and 251-6 cells. G2/M arrest was observed in vector control cells by 48 h, whereas MF-10 and 251-6 cells underwent apoptosis with increased number of cells exhibiting sub G1 DNA content. There was no significant difference in the cellular uptake of oxaliplatin nor in the level of platinum-DNA adducts at time points before the observation of apoptotic cells between vector controls, MF-10, or 251-6 cells (p > 0.3, Student's two-tailed t test).Table IEffect of the expression of kinase defective c-Src on the cell cycle phase distribution of Oxaliplatin-treated KM12L4A human metastatic colon cancer cells Cell cycle analysis of the effects of Oxaliplatin (150 μm) on vector control, MF-10, and 251–6 cells at 24 and 48 h after drug treatment as determined by propidium-bound DNA content measured by flow cytometry.

Solary E. Hammann A. Dimanche-Boitrel M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7987-7992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), we examined whether expression of kinase-defective forms of c-Src would co-sensitize KM12L4A cells to Fas-induced apoptosis. Cells were exposed to the CH-11 Fas-activating antibody (25 ng/ml), and apoptosis was assessed up to 72 h later. Cells expressing either form of kinase-defective c-Src were significantly more sensitive to Fas-induced apoptosis with 90% cell death at 72 h compared with 20% cell death in the empty vector control cells (Fig. 4A). However, no differences were observed between the KML124A clones in the protein levels of Fas, Fas ligand, the adaptor FADD, or the negative regulator of the death-inducing signaling complex FLICE-inhibitory protein (data not shown). The role of the initiator caspase, caspase 8, in the co-sensitization to oxaliplatin and Fas by dominant negative c-Src was then examined. Oxaliplatin-induced apoptosis, the cleavage of caspase 8, and of the downstream effector caspase, caspase 3, was examined in control and MF-10 cells in the presence and absence of the caspase 8-specific inhibitor IETD CHO or the caspase 3 (and 7) inhibitor DEVD CHO (Fig. 4, A and B). Oxaliplatin-induced cleavage of both caspase 8 and caspase 3 was observed in MF-10 but not vector control cells. That IETD CHO suppressed both the oxaliplatin-induced cleavage of caspase 8 and of caspase 3 suggested that it acted upstream of caspase 3 in the oxaliplatin-induced apoptotic pathway (Fig. 4B). Consistent with these data, the dominant negative c-Src-mediated sensitization to oxaliplatin-induced apoptosis was completely abrogated by caspase 8 inhibition (Fig. 4C). Caspase 3 inhibition also prevented the detection of cleaved caspase 8 (Fig. 4B), implying that caspase 3 may be acting as an amplifier of caspase 8 cleavage. The pro-apoptotic BH-3-only Bcl-2 family member Bid is cleaved by caspase 8 to generate truncated Bid that directly or indirectly activates Bax and/or Bak at the mitochondrial surface to facilitate release of apoptogenic factors from mitochondria in a pathway that ultimately activates effector caspases (32Degli Esposti M. Dive C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 304: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Oxaliplatin treatment resulted in increased full-length Bid in both vector control and MF-10 cells (Fig. 4D). However, Bid was cleaved only in oxaliplatin-treated MF-10 cells (Fig. 4D). In MF-10 cells the appearance of truncated Bid was suppressed by inhibition of caspase 8 or caspase 3, again suggesting that caspase 3 activity served to amplify a caspase 8-initiated apoptotic pathway. The Sensitivity to Oxaliplatin in c-Src-defective Mutants Was Not Attributable to a Kinase-independent Scaffold Function of Src—The data above show that increased oxaliplatin sensitivity was observed in KM12L4A cells that stably overexpress full-length kinase-defective Src in an open conformation (i.e. in MF-10) and in those which overexpress truncated Src mutants without the kinase domain but with open available SH3 and SH2 domains (i.e. 251-6 and 251-13). To determine whether the enhanced oxaliplatin sensitivity was due to the SH3-SH2 scaffold function of c-Src, the response to oxaliplatin was tested in KM12L4A cells overexpressing the same truncated c-Src mutants in which the additional function blocking point mutations were present in either the SH3 or SH2 domain (i.e. MFW and MFR). Fig. 5 shows that, like MF10 and 251-6 cells, MFW and MFR cells exhibited enhanced sensitivity to oxaliplatin compared with vector controls. The point mutations in the SH3 and SH2 domains have been previously shown to abrogate protein-protein interactions with c-Src, suggesting that these interactions are not required for the observed oxaliplatin sensitivity (33Avizienyte E. Fincham V.J. Brunton V.G. Frame M.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2794-2803Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Inhibition of c-Src Kinase by PP2 Did Not Sensitize KML4A Control Cells to Oxaliplatin-induced Death—To confirm that c-Src kinase activity modulates oxaliplatin-induced apoptosis in KM12L4A cells, we examined the impact of the small molecular weight Src TK inhibitor PP2 on oxaliplatin response in KM12L4A vector control cells. In contrast to the stable expression of kinase-defective c-Src mutants (e.g. MF-10) PP2 (1–10 μm) when added every 24 h for up to 72 h had no effect on oxaliplatin response (Fig. 6A), although it clearly reduced c-Src kinase activity as determined by reduced reactivity with the phospho-specific antibody reactive with the tyrosine 416-phosphorylated form of c-Src (Fig. 6B). The lack of effect of PP2 on oxaliplatin-induced apoptosis was not a reflection of altered cell growth kinetics over the 72-h period (data not shown). Similar studies using herbimycin A at the minimal concentration that inhibited Src kinase activity but at a time point at which there was no decrease in c-Src expression also failed to increase the levels of oxaliplatin-induced apoptosis (data not shown). The Role of Bcl-xL in Cell Lines Expressing Kinase-defective Mutants of c-Src or Those Treated with a Small Molecule Src Kinase Inhibitor—Src is implicated in signaling for the up-regulation of Bcl-xL in a variety of cell types including intestinal epithelial cells (18Cao X. Tay A. Guy G.R. Tan Y.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1595-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 20Coll M.L. Rosen K. Ladeda V. Filmus J.

Indeed this was observed in all KM12L4A cell lines expressing c-Src kinase-defective mutants compared with vector controls (Fig. 6C). However, daily exposure to 1–10 μm PP2, although reducing c-Src activity, failed to reduce Bcl-xL levels in KM12L4A vector control cells, consistent with its"
https://openalex.org/W1980394089,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is associated with several human cancers. Latent membrane protein 1 (LMP-1) is one of the key viral proteins required for transformation of primary B cells in vitro and establishment of EBV latency. In this report, we show that LMP-1 is able to induce the expression of several interferon (IFN)-stimulated genes (ISGs) with antiviral properties such as 2'-5' oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS), stimulated trans-acting factor of 50 kDa (STAF-50), and ISG-15. LMP-1 inhibits vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) replication at low multiplicity of infection (0.1 pfu/cell). The antiviral effect of LMP-1 is associated with the ability of LMP-1 to induce ISGs; an LMP-1 mutant that cannot induce ISGs fails to induce an antiviral state. High levels of ISGs are expressed in EBV latency cells in which LMP-1 is expressed. EBV latency cells have antiviral activity that inhibits replication of superinfecting VSV. The antiviral activity of LMP-1 is apparently not related to IFN production in our experimental systems. In addition, EBV latency is responsive to viral superinfection: LMP-1 is induced and EBV latency is disrupted by EBV lytic replication during VSV superinfection of EBV latency cells. These data suggest that LMP-1 has antiviral effect, which may be an intrinsic part of EBV latency program to assist the establishment and/or maintenance of EBV latency."
https://openalex.org/W2004829901,"A variety of cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins can be modified on serine and threonine residues by O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc), although the effects of this modification on protein and cellular functions are not completely defined. The sugar donor for the O-GlcNAc transferase that catalyzes this post-translational modification is UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), a product of the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP). Here, the dynamics of the O-GlcNAc modification are examined in the physiological context of agonist-induced signal transduction using neutrophils. Formylated Met-Leu-Phe (fMLF) is shown to stimulate a rapid and transient increase in protein O-GlcNAcylation in both immunoblot and immunofluorescence imaging assays using O-GlcNAc-specific antibodies. In high performance liquid chromatography analyses of HBP metabolic activity, short term exposure to an exogenous substrate of the HBP, glucosamine (GlcNH2), leads to increased GlcNH2 6-phosphate and then UDP-GlcNAc levels. The GlcNH2 treatments also increase O-GlcNAcylation and augment the aforementioned fMLF-associated increase. In functional assays, GlcNH2 pre-treatment selectively augments fMLF-induced chemotaxis but has little effect on respiratory burst activity. Furthermore, augmenting levels of O-GlcNAc in the absence of agonist is sufficient to stimulate chemotaxis. These data demonstrate that neutrophils possess a functionally significant O-GlcNAcylation pathway that is robustly induced by stimulation with agonist. We propose that O-GlcNAcylation plays an important role in rapid and dynamic neutrophil signal transduction, especially with respect to chemotaxis.

The cloning and characterization of enzymes responsible for the addition, O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), and removal, neutral β-N-acetylglucosaminidase, of O-GlcNAc moieties supported this idea (11Kreppel L.K.

However, it has only been over the last few years that studies have begun to elucidate functional roles for O-GlcNAc and have uncovered mechanisms through which it may modulate cellular signaling pathways, and thereby cellular function, in health and disease. For example, altered O-GlcNAcylation has been extensively investigated with respect to its role in the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus (6Vosseller K. Wells L. Lane M.D. Hart G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Res. 1995; 41: 270-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar).Many of the approaches used to investigate O-GlcNAc function have relied on the manipulation of hexosamine biosynthesis. Approximately 2–5% of the total glucose transported into cells feeds into the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP) to form glucosamine (GlcNH2) 6-phosphate (GlcNH2 6-P) and ultimately UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), the sugar donor for OGT (21Marshall S. Nadeau O. Yamasaki K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; : 824-831Google Scholar). OGT activity has been found to be sensitive to relatively small changes in substrate availability over a wide range of substrate concentrations and, additionally, recognizes different acceptor proteins at different concentrations of UDP-GlcNAc (22Kreppel L.K. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32015-32022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Thus, as several studies have shown, when cells in culture (4Gao Y. Miyazaki J.

This indicates that elevated levels of glucose lead to enhanced HBP flux and UDP-GlcNAc formation and thereby enhanced O-GlcNAc. Exogenous GlcNH2, which is not normally present in the cellular environment at appreciable levels, is also transported into cells and preferentially metabolized through this pathway, resulting in enhanced O-GlcNAc (6Vosseller K. Wells L. Lane M.D. Hart G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5313-5318Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 21Marshall S. Nadeau O. Yamasaki K. J. Biol.

The current body of research in this area supports these ideas, and several reviews have recently emerged expounding their various facets (1Wells L. Vosseller K. Hart G.W. Science. 2001; 291: 2376-2378Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar, 7Wells L. Whalen S.A. Hart G.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

However, important questions remain. Foremost among these is whether O-GlcNAc can serve as a rapid, highly inducible signal transduction mechanism akin to phosphorylation, the archetypal regulatory mechanism for the coupling of extracellular signals to specific cell responses.The bulk of the work on the functional significance of O-GlcNAc has relied on long term treatments, hours or days, with either high glucose (4Gao Y. Miyazaki J. Hart G.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 415: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 14Du X.L. Edelstein D. Rossetti L. Fantus I.G. Goldberg H. Ziyadeh F. Wu J. Brownlee M.

Commun. 2002; 293: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) that inhibit specific enzymes in the pathways affecting O-GlcNAcylation to manipulate this protein modification. Lymphocytes provided early evidence that O-GlcNAcylation can be a dynamic process, because pharmacological mitogens were shown to induce changes in cellular O-GlcNAc over times as short as 1 h (9Kearse K.P. Hart G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1701-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In addition, certain pharmacological agents that bypass physiologically relevant agonist- and receptor-specific signaling mechanisms induce relatively rapid changes in O-GlcNAc. In particular, pharmacological treatments with the calcium ionophore A23187 and the protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid have been shown to induce changes in O-GlcNAc within 1 min, suggesting that O-GlcNAc responses may indeed proceed quite rapidly (28Griffith L.S. Schmitz B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 824-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). These examples are often used as corroborative evidence of the potential of O-GlcNAc as a signaling mechanism that is analogous to phosphorylation. There is, however, only limited evidence of physiological agonist-induced, receptor-mediated changes in O-GlcNAcylation. Specifically, insulin infusions over several hours lead to increases in O-GlcNAc, although it is likely that these responses are due to an increase in glucose transport and a slowly progressive increase in HBP flux rather than a direct effect of insulin on the O-GlcNAcylation machinery (6Vosseller K.

These responses, which include degranulation, phagocytosis, chemotaxis, a respiratory burst, and alterations in gene expression, ultimately lead to microbe killing. Within this context PMNs have served as useful models for studying the signal transduction mechanisms involved in cellular stimulation. One of the most commonly used PMN stimuli, the chemotactic tripeptide formyl-methionine-leucine-phenylalanine (fMLF), binds to cell surface receptors and induces protein phosphorylation within tens of seconds (31Andrews P.C. Babior B.M. Blood. 1983; 61: 333-340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Andrews P.C. Babior B.M. Blood. 1984; 64: 883-890Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Omann G.M. Allen R.A. Bokoch G.M. Painter R.G. Traynor A.E. Sklar L.A. Physiol. Rev. 1987; 67: 285-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). These phosphorylation events are central to a diverse set of signaling pathways, leading, for example, to chemotaxis and the production of reactive oxygen species (34Downey G.P. Butler J.R. Tapper H.

We report here that PMNs possess a functionally significant HBP and associated O-GlcNAcylation mechanism. In doing so, we also provide evidence of rapid and robust agonist-induced changes in O-GlcNAcylation. We show that PMNs respond rapidly to both GlcNH2 and agonist, leading to similar and additive increases in protein O-GlcNAcylation. Our data support the premise that protein O-GlcNAcylation is a highly dynamic signaling mechanism capable of rapidly transducing receptor-associated signals to influence cellular function.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPMN Isolation—Whole blood from volunteers was obtained by venipuncture and layered onto a double discontinuous gradient formed with equal volumes of Histopaque-1077 (Sigma) over Histopaque-1119 (Sigma) (39English D. Anderson B. J. Immunol. Methods. 1974; 5: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). The blood was centrifuged at 700 × g for 30 min. Granulocytes were collected from the 1077/1119 interface and washed in Hanks' buffered salt solution buffered with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 (HBSS). Contaminating red blood cells were lysed by incubation in 0.15 m NH4Cl/1 mm KHCO3/0.1 mm EDTA for 5 min at 37 °C. The granulocytes were then washed twice in HBSS and resuspended in HBSS. The resulting samples were >95% PMNs as indicated by the polymorphic nature of their nuclei (see “Immunofluorescence Microscopy” below). Cell viability was assessed through Trypan Blue (Sigma) exclusion.Immunoblotting—2 × 106 PMNs were treated as indicated, directly lysed in 5× sample buffer (0.3 m Tris·HCl/5% SDS/50% glycerol/0.025% bromphenol blue/5% mercaptoethanol) and boiled for 5 min. 7.5 × 105 cell equivalents per lane (∼60 μg of protein) were separated by SDS-PAGE (40Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206016) Google Scholar) and transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore). Immunoblotting was performed using a rapid immunodetection method for Immobilon-P (Millipore Tech Note TN051). Briefly, the membranes were equilibrated in methanol and air dried. The dry membrane was incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of anti-O-GlcNAc antibody CTD110.6 (41Comer F.I. Vosseller K. Wells L. Accavitti M.A. Hart G.W. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 293: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) (Covance) in 1% casein/phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (Pierce) with 0.01% Tween 20 for 2 h and then washed three times in PBS. To demonstrate O-GlcNAc-specific immunoreactivity, 10 mm GlcNAc was added during the primary antibody incubation (41Comer F.I. Vosseller K. Wells L. Accavitti M.A. Hart G.W. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 293: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The membrane was then incubated with a 1:5000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM (Calbiochem) in 1% casein/PBS with 0.01% Tween 20 for 1 h. After further washing in PBS the immunoblots were developed with enhanced chemiluminescence (SuperSignal West Pico; Pierce).Immunofluorescence Microscopy—PMNs at 1.25 × 106 cells/ml were treated as indicated. The cells were fixed by adding an equal volume of 6% formaldehyde (Tousimis)/PBS for 30 min and resuspended in PBS. The cells were cytospun onto glass coverslips at 500 × g for 5 min. The coverslips were post-fixed in 3% formaldehyde/PBS for 10 min and washed with PBS. The PMNs were permeabilized with methanol (–20 °C) for 2 min. After washing, the coverslips were blocked for 30 min at room temperature in 1% casein/PBS with 0.2% Tween 20 and then incubated with a 1:250 dilution of anti-O-GlcNAc antibody CTD110.6 in 1% casein/PBS with 0.2% Tween 20 for 60 min at 37 °C. To demonstrate O-GlcNAc-specific immunoreactivity, 100 mm GlcNAc was added during the primary antibody incubation. After washing, the coverslips were then blocked for 10 min at room temperature with 10% normal goat serum (Sigma)/PBS with 0.2% Tween 20 and then incubated with a 1:250 dilution of Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated goat antimouse IgM (Molecular Probes) in 10% normal goat serum/PBS with 0.2% Tween 20 for 45 min at room temperature. The coverslips were finally washed and mounted with 9:1 glycerol/PBS. Hoechst 33258 (Molecular Probes), 1:1000 dilution of 10 mg/ml stock, was used when indicated to counterstain nuclei (>95% of cells stained had polymorphic nuclei consistent with PMN nuclear morphology). Quantification of fMLF-induced O-GlcNAc label by fluorescence intensity was performed using Image J (National Institutes of Health).GlcNH2 6-P and UDP-GlcNAc Determinations—5 × 106 PMNs were treated as indicated and analyzed for GlcNH2 6-P and UDP-GlcNAc as previously described (42Robinson K.A. Weinstein M.L. Lindenmayer G.E. Buse M.G. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 1438-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were centrifuged, and the pellet was extracted with 100 μl of 0.3 m perchloric acid. The extract was centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C at 14,000 × g, and 200 μl of 1:4 trioctylamine:1,1,2-trichlorotrifluoroethane (freon) was mixed with the resulting supernatant. The mixture was centrifuged for 5 min at 4 °C at 14,000 × g, and the aqueous phase (top) was stored at –80 °C for up to 1 week. For HPLC determination of UDP-GlcNAc the aqueous phase was run on a strong anion exchange column (Partisil SAX; Thermo) with the detector set to 262 nm. The flow rate was 2 ml/min, with the mobile phases consisting of 5 mm NH4H2PO4, pH 2.8, and 750 mm NH4H2PO4, pH 3.7, for buffers A and B, respectively, with a linear gradient from 0% to 100% buffer B over 40 min. The retention time for UDP-GlcNAc was ∼17 min. For the HPLC determination of GlcNH2 6-P 100 μl of the aqueous phase was mixed with 200 μl of 6 mmO-pthalaldehyde (OPA) (Sigma)/1% ethanol/0.2% mercaptoethanol/0.2 m boric acid, pH 9.7, for 1 min followed by neutralization with 400 μl of 100 mm NaH2PO4. The sample was then loaded onto a C-18 column (Ultrasphere; Beckman Coulter) with the detector set to 340 nm. The flow rate was 0.5 ml/min, with the mobile phases consisting of 90% 16.7 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.2/5% iso-propanol/5% acetonitrile and 76% 19.7 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.2/12% iso-propanol/12% acetonitrile for buffers A and B, respectively, with a linear gradient from 0% to 100% B over 15 min followed by a linear gradient of 100% to 0% buffer B over 10 min. The retention time for GlcNH2 6-P was ∼9.5 min. The data were analyzed and quantified as area under the curve by System Gold Nouveau software (Beckman Coulter). For determination of nanomoles of UDP-GlcNAc/mg of protein and picomoles of GlcNH2 6-P/mg of protein, UDP-GlcNAc (Sigma) and GlcNH2 6-P (Sigma) standards were run to establish molar reference values. PMN cell equivalents lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40/0.5% sodium deoxycholate/50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4/150 mm NaCl were assayed using the Lowry method (43Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for protein concentration determination.Chemotaxis Assays—2 × 105 PMNs were pre-treated as indicated, washed, resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/5% bovine serum albumin and then placed in the upper filter plate of a Multi-Screen-MIC chemotaxis plate (Millipore) with 3-μm membrane pores. The lower receiver plate contained Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 100 μm fMLF where indicated. Basal chemotaxis was assessed in the absence of fMLF. The chemotaxis chambers were placed in a 37 °C incubator for 45 min. The filter plate was then carefully removed, and migrating cells were counted by microscopic examination of receiver plates (44Frevert C.W. Wong V.A. Goodman R.B. Goodwin R. Martin T.R. J. Immunol. Methods. 1998; 213: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar).Respiratory Burst Assays—PMN respiratory burst activity was assessed by luminol-dependent chemiluminescence (45Wymann M.P. von Tscharner V. Deranleau D.A. Baggiolini M. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 165: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The PMNs were pretreated where indicated, and all samples were rapidly washed before being assayed (the presence of free GlcNH2 in the chemiluminescence buffer was found to inhibit chemiluminescence readings). Samples were prepared by mixing 106 washed PMNs into HBSS/10 μm luminol/100 μm sodium azide/10 units/ml horseradish peroxidase. Chemiluminescence was monitored at room temperature in a tube-based luminometer (Optocomp 1; MGM Instruments) without stirring or shaking. Baseline readings were established over 30 s followed by stimulation with fMLF as indicated.RESULTSPMNs Display Rapid Agonist-induced Changes in O-GlcNAc—The formylated peptide fMLF is a well established and widely used PMN agonist. It rapidly activates a diverse group of signal transduction pathways by engaging a specific G-protein-coupled receptor (33Omann G.M. Allen R.A. Bokoch G.M. Painter R.G. Traynor A.E. Sklar L.A. Physiol. Rev. 1987; 67: 285-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). We used fMLF to assess whether receptor-associated stimulation could signal protein O-GlcNAcylation. 2 min of stimulation with 100 nm fMLF led to increased protein-associated O-GlcNAc as determined by immunoblot analyses of whole cell extracts with the O-GlcNAc-specific antibody CTD110.6 (Fig. 1A). A variety of proteins with molecular weights above ∼50 kDa were observed, with some variation in the banding pattern and/or intensity of some bands from experiment to experiment, as might be expected for primary PMN isolates. Additional analyses revealed that O-GlcNAcylation begins within 1 min of stimulation and progresses through 5 min (Fig. 1B). In each experiment the specificity of CTD110.6 immunoreactivity was established by competitively blocking antibody binding with free GlcNAc.Although the O-GlcNAc-specific antibody CTD110.6 has been successfully used previously in immunoblot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based assays (41Comer F.I. Vosseller K. Wells L. Accavitti M.A. Hart G.W. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 293: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), it has not been evaluated with respect to immunocytochemical microscopy. We developed a protocol using CTD110.6 in a fluorescence-based immunocytochemical assay as an alternate and complementary method of examining changes in O-GlcNAc modifications. 100 nm fMLF increased O-GlcNAc over 2 min of stimulation (Fig. 2A). We obtained low background, antibody-specific signal using formaldehyde fixation followed by methanol permeation. The permeation agent was a critical variable in developing this assay, as commonly used agents such as Triton and acetone yielded high nonspecific backgrounds (data not shown). The agonist-induced CTD110.6 signal was specific for protein-associated O-GlcNAc, because it was competitively blocked by free GlcNAc. These results paralleled our immunoblot data.Fig. 2Immunofluorescence microscopy reveals rapid agonist-induced protein O-GlcNAcylation. Immunofluorescence labeling was performed using the anti-O-GlcNAc antibody CTD110.6. The specificity of this antibody for protein O-GlcNAc was assessed by adding 100 mm GlcNAc to the primary antibody dilution buffer (indicated as +GlcNAc). A, PMNs were left unstimulated (control) or stimulated with 100 nm fMLF for 2 min. Two predominant labeling patterns were evident: a relatively intense punctate label and a less intense, diffuse and homogenous label. B, the more intense, punctate O-GlcNAc label was limited to the cytoplasm, as was evident when the cells were counterstained using the nuclear stain Hoechst 33258. PMNs were left unstimulated (control) or stimulated with 100 nm fMLF for 2 min. Higher magnification images of selected cells revealed a punctate label that was localized exclusively to the cytoplasm (the arrows in the low magnification images that are labeled as C and F, control, and fMLF, respectively, are the individual cells shown in the higher magnification views).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)CTD110.6 labeled both the nucleus and cytoplasm in resting and stimulated cells. The cells displayed two predominant patterns of label: a less intense, diffuse, and relatively homogenous label and a comparatively intense, non-homogenous, punctate label that, in contrast to a Hoechst counterstain that clearly defined the polymorphic multilobed PMN nucleus, was restricted to the cytoplasm. The punctate cytoplasmic label displayed the major increas"

We report here the first crystal structure of this metalloenzyme under different forms, free or complexed with the Hcy and folate substrates. The Arabidopsis thaliana MetE (AtMetE) crystals reveal a monomeric structure built by two (βα)8 barrels making a deep groove at their interface. The active site is located at the surface of the C-terminal domain, facing the large interdomain cleft. Inside the active site, His647, Cys649, and Cys733 are involved in zinc coordination, whereas Asp605, Ile437, and Ser439 interact with Hcy. Opposite the zinc/Hcy binding site, a cationic loop (residues 507–529) belonging to the C-terminal domain anchors the first glutamyl residue of CH3-H4PteGlu5. The pterin moiety of CH3-H4PteGlu5 is stacked with Trp567, enabling the N5-methyl group to protrude in the direction of the zinc atom. These data suggest a structural role of the N-terminal domain of AtMetE in the stabilization of loop 507–529 and in the interaction with the poly-glutamate chain of CH3-H4PteGlun. Comparison of AtMetE structures reveals that the addition of Hcy does not lead to a direct coordination of the sulfur atom with zinc but to a reorganization of the zinc binding site with a stronger coordination to Cys649, Cys733, and a water molecule."
https://openalex.org/W2145512353,"A new concept is introduced for the rational design of β-sheet ligands, which prevent protein aggregation. Oligomeric acylated aminopyrazoles with a donor-acceptor-donor (DAD) hydrogen bond pattern complementary to that of a β-sheet efficiently block the solvent-exposed β-sheet portions in Aβ-(1–40) and thereby prevent formation of insoluble protein aggregates. Density gradient centrifugation revealed that in the initial phase, the size of Aβ aggregates was efficiently kept between the trimeric and 15-meric state, whereas after 5 days an additional high molecular weight fraction appeared. With fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) exactly those two, i.e. a dimeric aminopyrazole with an oxalyl spacer and a trimeric head-to-tail connected aminopyrazole, of nine similar aminopyrazole ligands were identified as efficient aggregation retardants whose minimum energy conformations showed a perfect complementarity to a β-sheet. The concentration dependence of the inhibitory effect of a trimeric aminopyrazole derivative allowed an estimation of the dissociation constant in the range of 10–5m. Finally, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) was used to determine the aggregation kinetics of Aβ-(1–40) in the absence and in the presence of the ligands. From the comparable decrease in Aβ monomer concentration, we conclude that these β-sheet ligands do not prevent the initial oligomerization of monomeric Aβ but rather block further aggregation of spontaneously formed small oligomers. Together with the results from density gradient centrifugation and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy it is now possible to restrict the approximate size of soluble Aβ aggregates formed in the presence of both inhibitors from 3- to 15-mers.

Several pathological processes are connected with the formation of a β-sheet structure and subsequent protein aggregation. In particular amyloid deposition of the Aβ peptide is discussed as the primary cause for Alzheimer's disease. Structural conversions of proteins leading to the formation of β-sheet-rich aggregates are also documented for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), Parkinson's disease, and other protein misfolding diseases (1Wisniewski T. Aucouturier P. Soto C. Frangione B. Amyloid. 1998; 5: 212-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 2Carrell R.W. Lomas D.A. Lancet. 1997; 350: 134-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). To date only palliative therapies for those diseases are available. For this reason understanding the mechanism of aggregation and understanding the development of β-sheet binders, which can slow down or even prevent the pathological process, are of great importance both from a mechanistic and a therapeutic view (3Lansbury Jr., P.T. Acc. Chem. Res. 1996; 29: 317-321Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 4Cohen F.E. Kelly J.W. Nature. 2003; 426: 905-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar, 5Sacchettini J.C. Kelly J.W. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2002; 1: 267-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Approaches for Alzheimer's disease therapy, which are studied at present in several laboratories, constitute the activation of brain activity as well as recent experiments concerning a retarded aggregation, e.g. by the inhibition of secretases (6Yamada K. Ren X. Nabeshima T. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 80: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 7Soto C. Mol. Med.

In the future, the dissolution or clearance of aggregates from the neurocortex will definitely become an important research goal. Studies with active and passive Aβ immunization also appear very promising (8Schenk D. Barbour R. Dunn W. Gordon G. Grajeda H. Guido T. Hu K. Huang J. Johnson-Wood K. Khan K. Kholodenko D. Lee M.

Science. 1997; 275: 630-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). Based on solid state NMR investigations it is today generally assumed that the fibrils form a parallel β-sheet with residues in exact register and an alternating order of charged and hydrophobic side chains (12Benzinger T.L. Gregory D.M. Burkoth T.S. Miller-Auer H. Lynn D.G. Botto R.E. Meredith S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13407-13412Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 13West M.W. Wang W.

Several newer investigations indicate that medium size oligomers are the most neurotoxic species involved in Alzheimer's disease (15Lashuel H.A. Hartley D. Petre B.M. Waltz T. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Nature. 2002; 418: 291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar). Walsh and co-workers (16Walsh D.M. Hartley D.M. Kusumoto Y. Fezoui Y. Condron M.M. Lomakin A. Benedek G.B. Selkoe D.J. Teplow D.B.

Several new ligands or ligand classes have been identified that intervene with fibril or plaque formation (17Pappolla M. Bozner P. Soto C. Shao H. Robakis N.K. Zagorski M. Frangione B. Ghiso J. J.

However, very few ligands demonstrate a rational design. Those that do are modified peptides derived from key recognition elements of pathological proteins; Tjernberg et al. (22Tjernberg L.O. Naslund J. Lindqvist F. Johansson J. Karlstrom A.R. Thyberg J. Terenius L. Nordstedt C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8545-8548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar) were the first to discover that small peptides with the peptide fragment KLVFF taken directly from the middle part of Aβ are able to block Aβ aggregation. Soto et al. (23Soto C. Sigurdsson E.M. Morelli L. Kumar R.A. Castano E.M. Frangione B. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 822-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar) developed peptides with the LPFFD sequence that could be used as β-sheet breakers against Aβ. Others have modified these sequences, e.g. by inserting disrupting elements such as KKKKKK or EEEEE (24Lowe T.L. Strzelec A. Kiessling L.L. Murphy R.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7882-7889Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) or by adding amino acids DD (25Watanabe K. Nakamura K. Akikusa S. Okada T. Kodaka M. Konakahara T. Okuno H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In a very interesting approach, Meredith and co-workers (26Gordon D.J. Sciarretta K.L. Meredith S.C.

However, nonpeptidic inhibitors with a rational design are unknown to date. We present in this report 3-aminopyrazole derivatives and their oligomers as rationally designed nonpeptidic β-sheet templates that block Aβ aggregation.

The simulations were conducted in water applying the generalized born/surface area (GB/SA) solvation model. MonteCarlo conformational searches were performed over 3000 steps.Aggregation Assay for Density Gradient Centrifugation—Aβ-(1–40) was synthesized using Fmoc solid phase chemistry. Purity was >95% as estimated by reverse-phase HPLC and mass spectrometric analysis (Dr. P. Henklein, Institute for Biochemistry, Charité Berlin, Germany). Prior to incubation Aβ-(1–40) was dissolved in 100% water-free Me2SO at 3.4 mm. The ligand was added to 100% acetonitrile and dissolved at 50 °C in a screw cap vial for 1 day by repeated vortexing and sonificating. Centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min removed a minor portion of undissolved particles from the saturated solution. Concentration of the solution was estimated from the weighed out substance. The 5 mm stock solution was stored until use in the dark at room temperature. To start the aggregation process 250 μm Aβ-(1–40) was incubated with or without 750 μm Ampox (see Fig. 2, ligand 2) or 600 μm Trimer (see Fig. 2, ligand 9) in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 7.4% Me2SO, and 15% acetonitrile at 37 °C. The assay volume was 300 μl, enough for 3 aliquots of 100 μl taken after different incubation times to be analyzed by density gradient centrifugation.Density Gradient Centrifugation—A discontinuous gradient of iodixanol was preformed by layering 260 μl of 50% OptiPrep™ (AXIS-SHIELD, Oslo, Norway) at the bottom of an 11 × 34-mm Polyallomer centrifuge tube, overlayered by 260 μl of 40%, 260 μl of 30%, 780 μl of 20%, 260 μl of 10%, and 100 μl of 5% OptiPrep™. The total volume of the phosphate-buffered non-linear gradient was 1920 μl. The top of the gradient was overlaid by a 100-μl aliquot of incubated Aβ-(1–40). The tubes were spun at 259,000 × g for 4 h at 4 °C in a TL 100 ultracentrifuge (Beckman Instruments) with a TLS-55 rotor after 10 min, 1 day, and 5 days of incubation. After the centrifugation 14 fractions of 140 μl and one last fraction of 60 μl were harvested with a pipette by upward displacement. Fraction 1 from the top of the gradient was the least dense, and fraction 15 from the bottom was the most dense fraction. The fractions were subsequently analyzed with respect to their peptide content by Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE.SDS-PAGE with Silver Staining—The harvested fractions were analyzed by a denaturating discontinuous Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE optimized for the detection of small proteins (28Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10442) Google Scholar). A separating gel containing 11.8% acrylamide was overlaid with a 7.2% spacer gel and a stacking gel with 2.8% acrylamide in a Hoefer Mighty Small S.E. 250 (Hoefer Scientific Instruments, San Francisco, CA). A protein wide range marker (Mark12™ wide range protein standard, Invitrogen) with molecular weights between 2500 and 200,000 was used as a size standard. The protein amounts/fraction were determined by silver staining (29Heukeshoven F. Dernick R. Electrophoresis. 1985; 6: 103-112Crossref Scopus (1239) Google Scholar).Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy—Measurements were performed with the ConfoCor I instrument (Zeiss, Jena, Evotec, Hamburg, Germany) equipped with an argon laser. The pinhole diameter was 45 μm, and the focus was set 200 μm above the cover glass. Adjustment of diffusion times was achieved by comparing with rhodamine 6G. Measurements were made on Lab-Tek chambered borosilicate cover glasses (Nalge Nunc Int. Corp., Naperville, IL) used as sample carriers. The fluorescent probe Aβ-(1–42) was synthesized in solid phase using Fmoc chemistry and labeled directly at the N terminus with OregonGreen™ (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands). The peptide was purified by reverse-phase HPLC. Purity was >95% as estimated by reversephase HPLC and mass spectrometric analysis (Dr. P. Henklein, Institute of Biochemistry, Charité Berlin, Germany). The stock solution contained 500 nm labeled peptide in 5% water-free Me2SO, 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, and was filtered through 0.45-μm pore nylon filters. Although originally chosen for combination with unlabeled Aβ-(1–42) it proved to be more advantageous to use this probe with the less aggressively aggregating Aβ-(1–40). The unlabeled Aβ-(1–40) (Sigma) was dissolved at 500 μm in 100% water-free Me2SO. Comparative measurements with different ligands were performed with trifluoroacetate salts of the ligands, which rendered the sample preparation more convenient because of their higher solubility. The ligands were dissolved at a concentration of 5.4 mm in 100% Me2SO. The final incubation assay contained 20 μm Aβ-(1–40), 10 nm OregonGreen™-labeled Aβ-(1–42), with or without 100 μm ligand in 10 mm sodium phosphate and 6% Me2SO in a 50-μl final volume. All solutions were sterile filtered except the Aβ-(1–40) stock solution. For each sample the fluorescence intensities were recorded 10 times for 60 s directly after mixing and again after 1 day of incubation at room temperature. It should be noted that the sample holder of the instrument is not thermostated, so experiments were performed at ambient temperature.The concentration dependence was analyzed by repeated measurement cycles beginning after 2 h of incubation at room temperature and lasting for 8 h. In each cycle fluorescence fluctuations for each sample position were measured 20 times for 30 s with a resolution of 16.7 data points/s. All samples contained 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 50 mm NaCl, 33 μm Aβ-(1–40) (Bachem Biochemica, Heidelberg, Germany), 8% Me2SO, and 5.6 nm OregonGreen™-labeled Aβ-(1–42). The concentration of the ligand varied from 1.35 to 108 μm.ESI-MS—For ESI-MS experiments an acidic buffer (buffer A, NH4Ac/HCOOH; pH 4.2) or a neutral buffer (buffer B, Me4NAc; pH 6.8) was used. Samples containing 25 μm Aβ-(1–40) (Bachem Biochemica, Heidelberg, Germany) with or without inhibitors (melatonin, Ampox, or Trimer at concentrations of 250 μm) in 10 mm buffer with 4% Me2SO were freshly prepared. At last the stock solution of Aβ-(1–40) (2.50 mm in Me2SO) was added to the different samples, and the mixtures were subsequently incubated at 25 °C. The time of Aβ addition to the samples was set as the starting point of the aggregation experiments. At defined time points, 25-μl samples were injected into a Qstar Pulsar i ESI-time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany) with the standard ESI source mounted. Masses were measured between 700 and 2000 atomic mass units. Buffer A or buffer B was used as a transport solvent at flow rates of 50 μl/min. For ESI-MS experiments in the positive ion mode the following settings were applied: declustering potential (DP1), 85; focusing potential (FP), 225; declustering potential 2 (DP2), 15; ion energy (IE1), 2.0; nebulizer gas (GS1), 40; curtain gas (CUR), 25; and ion spray voltage (IS), 5400. The amount of monomeric Aβ was calculated by adding the peak heights of the monoisotopic M3+ = 1443.383 m/z, M4+ = 1082.787 m/z, and M5+ = 866.430 m/z peaks.Because all internal standards would potentially interfere with the aggregation process, the use of an internal mass standard was not possible in our case. Care was therefore taken to ensure that the four samples were injected under comparable ion source conditions for each time point measured. To this end, the different aggregation experiments (β-peptide dissolved in buffer or in buffer containing melatonin, Ampox, or Trimer, respectively) were all performed in parallel with a time lag of 5 min. Although the ESI source is normally stable over several days within an acceptable range, the experiments were repeated several times, assuring that temporary variations of the ESI spray efficiency did not influence the observed signal intensities.At the beginning of these experiments, we observed a somewhat unexpected effect; obviously the ESI source capillary adsorbed Aβ to a certain extent until saturation was reached. Flushing the source over a prolonged period (1 h) with buffer inverted this effect. Therefore we saturated the source before injection of our samples with freshly prepared monomeric Aβ solution.RESULTSConcept and Structures—In recent years, considerable effort has been invested in the synthesis of small soluble β-sheet structures (30Nowick J.S.

Simple β-sheet templates have also been incorporated into drugs that bind to a peptide region with β-sheet conformation (34Smith III, A.B. Hirschmann R. Pasternak A. Akaishi R. Guzman M.C. Jones D.R.

However, external templates, which force a peptide strand into the β-sheet conformation, are very rare (35Schrader T. Kirsten C. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1996; 1996: 2089-2093Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 36Schrader T.H. Kirsten C.N. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 12061-12068Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 37Weiner W.S. Hamilton A.D.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 475-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) very recently demonstrated the paramount importance of backbone hydrogen bonding for the formation of β-amyloid fibrils; replacing the amide bonds by ester linkages completely eliminated any aggregation propensity of the respective peptide-like compound taken from the Aβ sequence (26Gordon D.J. Sciarretta K.L. Meredith S.C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8237-8245Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 27Gordon D.J. Meredith S.C. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 475-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Some years ago, our group presented the first template molecule that is able to induce formation of the β-sheet conformation in small peptides (14Sticht H. Bayer P. Willbold D. Dames S. Hilbich C. Beyreuther K. Frank R.W. Rosch P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Both the top and the bottom face of the peptide are complexed, each with an aminopyrazole derivative involving every hydrogen bond donor and acceptor available. By detailed nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy-NMR experiments the postulated three-point binding mode could be proven, together with an almost perfect β-sheet conformation for the bound peptide. These results have been confirmed independently by detailed studies in the molecular beam (UV/UV hole burning, IR/resonant 2-photon ionization (R2PI) spectra) (38Unterberg C. Gerlach A. Schrader T.

Modeling experiments suggest that larger peptide strands may be bound much more tightly even in polar solvents if suitable aminopyrazole oligomers are lined up along their top and bottom faces. Effective capping of all free amino and carboxyl groups could thus prevent aggregation of the peptides.We have therefore devised new generations of dimeric and oligomeric ligands, retaining the perfect complementarity toward a β-sheet peptidic backbone (Fig. 1). Their synthesis has been described recently (40Rzepecki P. Wehner M. Molt O. Zadmard R. Schrader T. Synthesis. 2003; : 1815-1826Google Scholar). All respective ligand structures are depicted in Fig. 2. In two cases (Ampox 2 and AmpPyr 6 in Fig. 2), we obtained crystal structures; they confirmed the donor-acceptor-donor (DAD) hydrogen bond pattern of the aminopyrazoles as well as their flat, rigid overall conformation, rendering these ligands ideal candidates for the entropically favorable multipoint hydrogen bond interaction with β-sheets. The new classes of ligands have some common promising features; they are easily synthesized, contain non-toxic components, have low molecular weights around 300, and are neutral, stable molecules in their biologically active form (41.Schrader, T., Riesner, D., Nagel-Steger, L., Aschermann, K., Kirsten, C., Rzepecki, P., Molt, O., Zadmard, R., and Wehner, M.

(Phe residues involved in hydrophobic interactions are shown in light gray).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Experimental Analysis—Prior to systematic studies on the inhibition of protein aggregation by the designed β-sheet binders, two major experimental difficulties had to be overcome. These are (i) the low reproducibility of the Aβ aggregation, which is a typical difficulty with irreversible reactions, and (ii) the low solubility of the aminopyrazole derivatives in aqueous buffers. Induction of Aβ aggregation in the absence and presence of aminopyrazoles was achieved by decreasing the Me2SO concentration from 100% in the Aβ stock solution to a maximal 10% concentration. The details of the procedure are described under “Experimental Procedures.” We used two different approaches to analyze the interaction of the Aβ peptide with the aminopyrazole derivatives and its inhibitory effect on the peptide aggregation.Analysis of Aβ Aggregation by Density Gradient Ultracentrifugation—The size distribution of the protein aggregates formed during incubation with and without ligand was determined by a sedimentation analysis on a preformed gradient of iodixanol (OptiPrep™) (42Ward R.V. Jennings K.H. Jepras R. Neville W. Owen D.E. Hawkins J. Christie G. Davis J.B. George A. Karran E.H. Howlett D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The Aβ-(1–40) peptide was used because it was less prone to irreproducible aggregation than the longer Aβ-(1–42). The incubation mixtures contained 250 μm peptide to guarantee a sufficiently sensitive protein detection in the different fractions. A volume of 100 μl of aggregation assay was incubated for 10 min, 1 day, and 5 days at 37 °C, respectively, and overlaid on a step gradient of 5–50% OptiPrep™. After centrifugation 15 fractions of 140 μl each were harvested by pipetting from the top of the gradient; fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining (Fig. 3). The uncharged ligands with molecular weights below 500 were not stained in the gels. Without addition of an aminopyrazole compound the Aβ peptide was highly aggregated already at 10 min of incubation time; i.e. most of the protein was found within the bottom five fractions containing 30–50% OptiPrep™ with a density from 1.14 to 1.36 g/cm3 as determined by refractometric measurements. By comparison with gradients loaded with proteins of known s-values, these fractions contained aggregates with s-values of at least 18 S. In the bottom fraction Aβ peptide has reached its buoyant density; i.e. it does not sediment further. Some peptide, however, was left in the first three or four fractions (corresponding to s-values between 3 and 5 S). Aggregation assays without added ligand analyzed after 1 day of incubation at 37 °C showed a very narrow distribution over only two fractions (fractions 12 and 13) at the bottom of the gradient. After 5 days of incubation Aβ concentrates in fractions 13 and 14. The narrow distributions after 1 day and particularly after 5 days of incubation represented large aggregates. By contrast aggregation assays containing 750 μm Ampox or 600 μm Trimer showed an enrichment of the Aβ peptide in the upper half of the gradient, whereas nearly no peptide could be detected in the bottom fractions at the first time point. Only Ampox and Trimer were analyzed by density gradient (Fig. 3) because only these showed marked inhibition of aggregation during screening of all components by FCS (see the next paragraph). For Ampox the observed shift to lower s-values was still visible after 1 day of incubation, although after 1 and 5 days of incubation larger Aβ aggregates appeared in fractions 12, 13, and 14 similarly to the control experiment. Even after 5 days of incubation, however, some peptide could still be detected in the upper half of the gradient. For Trimer the larger aggregates were still missing after 1 day of incubation but appeared after a 5-day incubation period. The fractions in the upper half of the gradient correspond to s-values between 3 and 5S; i.e. the size of aggregates is below 15-mers. Thus by density gradient centrifugation we demonstrated that the aminopyrazoles Ampox and Trimer drastically influenced the size distribution of formed Aβ-(1–40) aggregates by increasing the number of small oligomeric species. Because larger aggregates as found in the control also appeared in the presence of the ligands after longer incubation times it looks rather like a retardation of the aggregation process than a prolonged prevention of aggregate formation caused by"

Muscle Nerve. 2000; 23: 1456-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Vertebrate DG is transcribed as a single mRNA and translates into a 895-amino acid polypeptide (1Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya O. Ervasti J.M. Leveille C.J. Slaughter C.A. Sernett S.W. Campbell K.P. Nature. 1992; 355: 696-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (1198) Google Scholar). This precursor undergoes an early posttranslational cleavage with the release of the highly glycosylated peripheral membrane protein α-DG and the transmembrane subunit β-DG, both being targeted separately to the plasma membrane (4Holt K.H. Crosbie R.H. Venzke D.P. Campbell K.P. FEBS Lett. 2000; 468: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The two subunits remain tightly associated via non-covalent interactions. In skeletal muscle, they form together with sarcoglycans, sarcospan, syntrophins, and dystrobrevins the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC). This complex links the extracellular matrix (ECM) with the actin cytoskeleton and provides stability to the muscle fiber sarcolemma against contractile forces (3Cohn R.D. Campbell K.P. Muscle Nerve. 2000; 23: 1456-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Electron microscopy studies showed that the α-DG subunit is a 20–30-nm-long dumbbell-shaped molecule. It contains a central mucin-like part, comprising residues 315–485, and is flanked by two globular regions (5Brancaccio A. Schulthess T. Gesemann M. Engel J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 139-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) (see supplemental Fig. 1). The interactions of α-DG with laminin G-like domains “LG,” also called “LNS” (LG/LNS) domain-containing ECM molecules, is thought to mainly involve the carbohydrate moieties protruding from the α-DG mucin-like region and the protein epitopes of LG/LNS domains (6Tisi D. Talts J.F. Timpl R. Hohenester E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1432-1440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Hohenester E. Tisi D. Talts J.F. Timpl R. Mol.

Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya O. Campbell K.P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 831-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar) show premature lethality, indicating that DG plays a crucial role during early embryonic development prior to myogenesis, muscle basement membrane formation, or stabilization. Accordingly, no natural genetic defects have been found in the highly conserved DG gene in living individuals so far, but genetic abnormalities in DG binding partners like laminin-2 or dystrophin as well as in any of the members of the sarcoglycan complex cause severe muscular dystrophy phenotypes (3Cohn R.D. Campbell K.P. Muscle Nerve. 2000; 23: 1456-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Furthermore, α-DG can act as a direct receptor for Arena viruses, including Lassa fever virus (9Cao W. Henry M.D. Borrow P. Yamada H. Elder J.H. Ravkov E.V. Nichol S.T. Compans R.W. Campbell K.P. Oldstone M.B. Science. 1998; 282: 2079-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 10Jung D. Yang B.

The amino acids 169–408 of α-DG contain an essential binding site for the entry of Arena viruses via its GP1 envelope protein (12Kunz S. Sevilla N. McGavern D.B. Campbell K.P. Oldstone M.B. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The involvement of DG in this broad range of pathological situations makes it attractive for structural and functional studies aimed to define the molecular basis for the recognition of the binding partners in the DGC. The crystal structure of the murine α-DG fragment (50–313)R166H, corresponding to its N-terminal globular region, represents the first structural elucidation of a DG component. The structure is characterized by an N-terminal Ig-like domain and a C-terminal domain, whose fold resembles that of ribosomal RNA-binding proteins. The two domains are connected by a long and flexible linker. Solid-phase binding assays with the modular domain construct (28–313)R166H, not including the mucin-like region, as well as with each of the two separate domains, (28–168) and (168–313), respectively, pinpoint to the occurrence of some protein-protein interactions contributing to the laminin/α-DG interaction, as first reported by Hall et al. (13Hall H. Bozic D. Michel K. Hubbell J.A. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2003; 24: 1062-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Crystallization and Data Collection—The murine α-DG(50–313)R166H DNA construct and the corresponding recombinant protein were prepared as described previously (14Bozic D. Engel J. Brancaccio A. Matrix Biol. 1998; 17: 495-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) using standard PCR protocols and appropriate primers. Crystals were grown at 4 °C by vapor diffusion sitting drops (3 μl + 3 μl) against a reservoir of 1 m sodium citrate/citric acid at pH 7.0 at a protein concentration of 7 mg ml-1. To overcome the problem of twinning due to fast nucleation, the rate of crystal formation was slowed down using mineral oil seal covering the crystallization drop. For data collection the crystals were transferred to a solution containing 1.1 m sodium citrate/citric acid at pH 7.0 and 25% ethylene glycol. All data sets were collected using CuKα radiation from an Enraf-Nonius rotating-anode x-ray source and a MAR image-plate detector system with crystals flash frozen to 100 K in the nitrogen stream of an Oxford Cryosystems cooling device. The crystals belong to the space group R3 with unit cell constants a = b = 71.4 Å, c = 144.2 Å, α = β = 90°, and γ = 120°. They have one molecule in the asymmetric unit with a calculated solvent content of 45%. All collected data were integrated and reduced with DENZO/SCALEPACK (15Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

A bulk solvent correction was applied, and a 5% test set for the calculation of the Rfree was used. Only KI was found to be useful as a derivative for difference Patterson interpretation. Due to weak data quality combined with a high twinning fraction the thiomersalic acid heavy atom data set was not interpretable by difference Patterson methods but only useful for difference Fourier and cross phasing. Patterson map calculations were performed using CNS_SOLVE (16Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J.

Initial phasing was performed with MLPHARE followed by density modification using DM from the Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 suite (17Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). Final phasing was performed within SHARP (18de LaFortelle E. Bricogne G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 267: 472-494Crossref Scopus (1797) Google Scholar). Model building was performed with the programs MAIN (19Turk D. MAIN.

A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). When the high-resolution data set (native 3) became available, a round of simulated annealing from 5000 K was performed and the structure was refined to 2.3-Å resolution (Fig. 1). The refinement statistics are summarized in Table I. Solid-phase Binding Assays—The full-length cDNA coding for murine dystroglycan was also used as template to generate both the α-DG N-terminal region (28–313)R166H and the separated domains (28–168)R166H and (168–313) by established PCR protocols. The recombinant proteins were expressed and purified as described elsewhere (21Sciandra F. Schneider M. Giardina B. Baumgartner S. Petrucci T.C. Brancaccio A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 4590-4597Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Murine laminin-1 (Sigma), α-DG(28–313)R166H, and domains α-DG(28–168) and α-DG(168–313) were biotinylated in 5 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, with 0.5 mg/ml sulfo-N-hydroxylsuccinimido-biotin with a molar ratio protein/biotin 1:10. The reactions were carried out for 30 min on ice. Biotinylated proteins were then dialyzed against 10 mm Tris/HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. To assess the binding properties of recombinant α-DG fragments, solid-phase binding assays were performed as follows: 0.5 μg of murine laminin-1 (Sigma) were immobilized on microtiter plates in 50 mm NaHCO3, pH 9.6, overnight at 4 °C. Plates were then washed with washing buffer (WB: phosphate-buffered saline, 0.005% Tween 20, 1.25 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2) and blocked with 3% BSA in WB. Wells were then incubated with increasing concentrations of biotinylated α-DG(28–313)R166H and of domains α-DG(28–168) and α-DG(168–313), in WB with 3% BSA for3hat room temperature. The biotinylated bound fraction was detected with alkaline phosphatase Vectastain AB Complex (Vector Laboratory) using a solution of p-nitrophenyl phosphate as substrate. Absorbance values, in triplicate, were recorded at 405 nm. Data were fitted using a “single class of equivalent binding sites” equation: Ai = [Asat × (c/Kd+c)], where Ai represents the absorbance measured at increasing concentrations of ligand, Kd is the binding dissociation constant, c is the concentration of ligand, and Asat is the absorbance at saturation. Data were normalized according to the equation (Ai/Asat) and reported as fractional saturation (percent). Overall Structure—The murine α-DG N-terminal fragment shows an L-shaped modular domain architecture, and the presence of two autonomous domains is fully confirmed (14Bozic D. Engel J. Brancaccio A. Matrix Biol. 1998; 17: 495-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). The first domain (Fig. 2, A–C) comprises residues 60–158 and belongs to the I-set of the Ig superfamily. The overall dimensions are 50 × 25 × 20 Å. The first β-sheet consists of the anti-parallel strands B, E, and D. The second β-sheet is formed by the strands A′, G, F, and C with strands A′ and G arranged in a parallel and G, F, and C in an anti-parallel fashion. Two helices are inserted into this framework; H1 between β-strands B and C and H2 (310 helix) between β-strand E and F. A DALI search (22Holm L. Sander C. Science. 1996; 273: 595-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar) revealed a z-score of 7.0 and an root mean square deviation of 2.4 Å for 78 out of 93 residues with twitchin (23Fong S. Hamill S.J. Proctor M. Freund S.M. Benian G.M. Chothia C. Bycroft M. Clarke J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 265: 624-639Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank entry 1WIT) as the closest structural neighbor (Fig. 2C). It is noteworthy that the present structure does not confirm a previous prediction, based on multiple sequence alignment, that this domain would show a cadherin-like fold (24Dickens N.J. Beatson S. Ponting C.P. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: R197-R199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In contrast to other members of the I-set, the A and C′ strands are not present in the herein described Ig module. The partial de-attachment of the N terminus (Fig. 2, A and C, and supplemental Fig. 2), and consequently the structural difference to other I-set Ig modules, arises from close crystallographic contacts of the N terminus to the B3B4 connecting loop of domain 2 from a neighboring symmetry related molecule. Another feature of the I-set fold is the conformational conservation of the AB and EF connections (Fig. 2C). In α-DG the AB connection fulfils this criterion, whereas the EF connection is longer. A 21-amino acid-long and partially not resolved flexible stretch connects the two domains. The presence of the complete and intact fragment was demonstrated by mass spectrometry using protein from dissolved crystals (data not shown). The second domain containing residues 180–303 has a ribosomal RNA-binding protein fold (Fig. 2, A, B, and D). The overall dimensions for the second domain are 37 × 30 × 25 Å. It consists of a central five-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet flanked on one side by three helices and leaves the opposite side of the β-sheet exposed and solvent-accessible (Fig. 2, A and D). An extended loop region between β-strands B2 and B3 folds over the central β-sheet and gives the molecule a “basket”-like shape with the B2B3 connection acting as a “handle.” According to DALI (22Holm L. Sander C. Science. 1996; 273: 595-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar) the second domain resembles a modification of the ribosomal protein S6 fold (Protein Data Bank code 1RIS) (25Lindahl M. Svensson L.A. Liljas A. Sedelnikova S.E. Eliseikina I.A. Fomenkova N.P. Nevskaya N. Nikonov S.V. Garber M.B. Muranova T.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1249-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The topology (Fig. 2, B and D) differs from the S6 fold in the additional B3 β-strand (green) with the double crossing of B2B3 and B3B4 interconnecting loops over the central β-sheet as well as the insertion of H1, H3, and the kink in H4H5 helices. This domain was recently identified as a major component of an interaction region between α-DG and the Arena virus GP1 protein (12Kunz S. Sevilla N. McGavern D.B. Campbell K.P. Oldstone M.B. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Interestingly, within the ribosomal protein S6 and other RNA-binding proteins belonging to the same family, the interactions with RNA have been mapped on the two central β-strands (25Lindahl M. Svensson L.A. Liljas A. Sedelnikova S.E. Eliseikina I.A. Fomenkova N.P. Nevskaya N. Nikonov S.V. Garber M.B. Muranova T.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1249-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). This region corresponds to the B1 and B4 β-strands within a basic cleft of the second domain (Fig. 2D). Interfaces and Crystal Contacts—The interface between domains 1 and 2 (Fig. 3A) has a total surface area of ∼681 Å2. A network of close hydrophobic and polar/charged side chain to side chain as well as side chain to backbone, and backbone to backbone interactions are found. Surface complementarity (26Jones S. Thornton J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (2289) Google Scholar) is 2.9 Å, a value that is in the range of typical antibody-protein and hetero complexes. The analysis of the crystal packing revealed the presence of a trimer (Fig. 2B). The interface is formed by the CFF′G strands including the BC, CD, and DE interconnecting loops and by the H5 helix and surrounding structural elements belonging to domains 1 and 2, respectively (Fig. 3C). The major binding contributions arise from the F′G strands and its interconnecting loop pointing into the convex cleft formed by the CFG strands between the FG extension and the CD interconnecting region of a symmetry equivalent molecule. Furthermore, the BC and DE interconnecting loops contact the CD connection of the same symmetry equivalent molecule. Due to this tight association the region that would correspond to the C′-strand, a conserved feature of the I-set of the Ig fold, gets disrupted and does not adapt to a β-strand conformation. The most prominent interaction of the crystallographic trimer within the second domain is the formation of a trimeric parallel one-heptade-long coiled coil by helix H5 and its symmetry-related counterparts (Fig. 3B). Namely, G282, A283, and A286 form the coiled coil interior at positions 1, 2, and 5 of the heptade repeat. Overall the sum of the three pair-wise interactions bury a total area of about 4300 Å2. This value is well within the range of molecules described to form oligomeric complexes (27Janin J. Rodier F. Proteins. 1995; 23: 580-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Individual contacts of each domain to the neighboring trimer are in the range of 350 and 120 Å2. However, it is unclear whether such trimeric assembly could be formed in solution. In fact, sedimentation equilibrium experiments were carried out at increasing concentrations of recombinant α-DG N-terminal fragment (28–313)R166H (up to 0.4 mg/ml) and did not show any self-associating behavior (data not shown). The Ig-like Domain of α-DG Binds Laminin-1—To investigate whether one of the domains belonging to the N-terminal region is involved in the binding to laminin, we have prepared two new recombinant protein fragments: namely, 28–168 (spanning the Ig-like domain) and 168–313 (spanning the ribosomal domain). Using solid-phase binding assays, we have observed binding (within the low μm range) with coated commercial murine laminin-1 only for the whole N-terminal fragment (28–313)R166H and the Ig-like (28–168) (Fig. 4). Our experiments would confirm the contribution of some protein-protein interactions within the α-DG-laminin complex, as reported recently (13Hall H. Bozic D. Michel K. Hubbell J.A. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2003; 24: 1062-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and show that the binding site for the protein type of interactions to laminin-1 is harbored by the Ig-like domain of α-DG. As a result of the present structural analysis, it is possible that α-DG fragments previously used to perform laminin binding studies could not match the domain borders herein identified (1Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya O. Ervasti J.M. Leveille C.J. Slaughter C.A. Sernett S.W. Campbell K.P. Nature. 1992; 355: 696-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (1198) Google Scholar). In previous studies, only carbohydrate-mediated binding activities for the interaction between α-DG and its binding partners were described (28Winder S.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 118-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). However, the complete exclusion of protein-mediated interactions in such a highly conserved molecule was somehow difficult to understand and justify. It is worth noting that recently it has been reported that the glycosyltransferase LARGE needs to recognize some protein epitopes within the N-terminal region of α-DG to properly initiate its glycosylation (29Kanagawa M. Saito F. Kunz S. Yoshida-Moriguchi T. Barresi R. Kobayashi Y.M. Muschler J. Dumanski J.P. Michele D.E. Oldstone M.B. Campbell K.P.

The present crystal structure provides the domain boundaries that will help the design of new recombinant constructs to carry out a rational site-directed mutagenesis approach aimed to further investigate important functional aspects of α-DG.

https://openalex.org/W2087791144,"The Escherichia coli adenine DNA glycosylase, MutY, plays an important role in the maintenance of genomic stability by catalyzing the removal of adenine opposite 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine or guanine in duplex DNA. Although the x-ray crystal structure of the catalytic domain of MutY revealed a mechanism for catalysis of the glycosyl bond, it appeared that several opportunistically positioned lysine side chains could participate in a secondary β-elimination reaction. In this investigation, it is established via site-directed mutagenesis and the determination of a 1.35-Å structure of MutY in complex with adenine that the abasic site (apurinic/apyrimidinic) lyase activity is alternatively regulated by two lysines, Lys142 and Lys20. Analyses of the crystallographic structure also suggest a role for Glu161 in the apurinic/apyrimidinic lyase chemistry. The β-elimination reaction is structurally and chemically uncoupled from the initial glycosyl bond scission, indicating that this reaction occurs as a consequence of active site plasticity and slow dissociation of the product complex. MutY with either the K142A or K20A mutation still catalyzes β and β-δ elimination reactions, and both mutants can be trapped as covalent enzyme-DNA intermediates by chemical reduction. The trapping was observed to occur both pre- and post-phosphodiester bond scission, establishing that both of these intermediates have significant half-lives. Thus, the final spectrum of DNA products generated reflects the outcome of a delicate balance of closely related equilibrium constants.

Over the last 15 years, multiple laboratories have investigated the catalytic mechanism of DNA glycosylases that initiate the base excision repair (BER) 1The abbreviations used are: BER, base-excision repair; AP, apurinic/apyrimidinic; 8-oxoG, 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine. pathway (reviewed in Refs. 1Stivers J.T.

These investigations have been successful in both localizing the active site pocket of these enzymes and identifying the key amino acids that participate in the catalytic events that lead to the excision of the inappropriate base. Determination of the chemical steps in the catalytic mechanism of DNA glycosylases is fundamental for understanding how organisms maintain their genome, despite the inevitable damage caused by exogenous and endogenous agents. DNA glycosylases with an associated AP lyase activity (β-elimination) can be distinguished from DNA glycosylases without such activity, based on the identity of the nucleophile that attacks C1′ of the deoxyribose sugar and whether the reaction proceeds through a covalent DNA-enzyme intermediate. DNA glycosylases that also catalyze a β-elimination reaction utilize a primary or secondary amine in the active site, whereas monofunctional glycosylases cleave the glycosyl bond via either the activation of a water molecule or a SN1 attack (reviewed in Refs. 1Stivers J.T. Jiang Y.L. Chem. Rev. 2003; 103: 2729-2759Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar and 18Dodson M.L. Kurtz A.J. Lloyd R.S. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 354: 202-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). When a primary or secondary amine is utilized as the nucleophile, a Schiff base intermediate is formed that can undergo β-elimination, resulting in the cleavage of the phosphodiester bond (5Dodson M.L. Michaels M.L. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32709-32712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The identity of the amino acid residue involved in the formation of the Schiff base intermediate can be elucidated by reduction with NaBH4 or NaCNBH3, resulting in the formation of a covalently trapped enzyme-DNA complex that can undergo peptide sequencing. This technique has been widely used as a diagnostic tool to differentiate glycosylases from glycosylase/AP lyases. In recent years, several reports have probed the catalytic mechanism of MutY (12Guan Y. Manuel R.C. Arvai A.S. Parikh S.S. Mol C.D. Miller J.H. Lloyd S. Tainer J.A. Nat. Struct.

Soc. 2003; 125: 16235-16242Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar); however, this mechanism and an accounting of the roles of catalytic residues have not been formalized. A straightforward interpretation of the complex catalytic mechanism of MutY has remained a challenge due to observations that the enzyme does not demonstrate standard Michaelis-Menten kinetics, with very slow enzyme turnover and apparent redundancies in potential catalytic residues (16Zharkov D.O. Gilboa R. Yagil I. Kycia J.H. Gerchman S.E. Shoham G. Grollman A.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14768-14778Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 19Zharkov D.O. Grollman A.P.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6465-6475Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Although there is a consensus on the glycosylase base excision activity of MutY, the AP lyase activity of MutY has remained poorly defined. Biochemical evidence has been presented that argues for MutY being a monofunctional glycosylase (19Zharkov D.O. Grollman A.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12384-12394Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 20Williams S.D. David S.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5123-5133Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 21Williams S.D. David S.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15417-15424Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), whereas other data are consistent with the enzyme being a glycosylase with a concomitant AP lyase activity (30Lu A.L. Yuen D.S. Cillo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24138-24143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 31Manuel R.C. Lloyd R.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11140-11152Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Although the latter data suggested an intrinsic AP lyase activity, initial attempts to trap the lyase reaction with NaBH4 were unsuccessful (6Sun B. Latham K.A. Dodson M.L. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19501-19508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Insight into the identity of specific catalytic residues came from the determination of the crystal structure of the 26-kDa catalytic domain of MutY (cMutY, residues Met1-Lys225) complexed with adenine (12Guan Y. Manuel R.C. Arvai A.S. Parikh S.S. Mol C.D. Miller J.H. Lloyd S. Tainer J.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 1058-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Examination of this structure suggested a reasonable hypothesis to explain and rationalize all prior data. The architecture of the 26-kDa domain of MutY revealed a structure consisting of two subdomains: a 4α-helical, 4Fe-4S cluster domain connected to a 6α-helical bundle containing a helix-hairpin-helix motif (Fig. 1A). Between these subdomains is a deep cleft that binds adenine; the glycosylase active site is composed of two acidic residues Glu37 and Asp138 (shown as the D138N mutant) that are located on opposite sides of the cleft (Fig. 1B). It was hypothesized that these residues have side chains positioned to both protonate N7 of adenine and activate a water molecule for nucleophilic attack at C1′ of the corresponding deoxyribose, a standard glycosylase reaction mechanism. Recently, a catalytically inactive cocrystal complex was solved of a full-length thermophilic homolog of MutY from Bacillus stearothermophilus with DNA containing an A:8-oxoG1 mismatch (17Fromme J.C. Banerjee A. Huang S.J. Verdine G.L. Nature. 2004; 427: 652-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). In this structure, the DNA was bent 55°, and the adenine was fully extruded from the helix and occupied roughly the same position as determined in the previous structure. The reaction mechanism inferred from this structure, suggests that the essential aspartic acid residue stabilizes the positively charged oxocarbenium intermediate in the base cleavage reaction (17Fromme J.C. Banerjee A. Huang S.J. Verdine G.L. Nature. 2004; 427: 652-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The experimental observation that gave the clue to the source of the lyase reaction came from data that demonstrated that the cMutY bound DNAs containing abasic site analogs with ∼1 nm binding constants. With the enzyme dissociation being very slow, it was hypothesized that a lysine residue (Lys142) would be available for initiating the lyase chemistry through the formation of a Schiff base intermediate (12Guan Y. Manuel R.C. Arvai A.S. Parikh S.S. Mol C.D. Miller J.H. Lloyd S. Tainer J.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 1058-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Thus, the glycosylase and AP lyase reactions were postulated to be uncoupled, and the lyase chemistry occurred only as a consequence of an opportunistically positioned lysine residue. These hypotheses provided reasonable explanations for why NaBH4-induced trapping of MutY was inefficient, since following the glycosylase reaction, the strong reducing agent NaBH4 will reduce the transiently ring-opened deoxyribose, rendering it unreactive for further β-elimination chemistry. Experimental verification of this hypothesis appeared concomitantly with the crystal structure in which conditions were established for the trapping of a covalent complex between MutY and an A:G mismatch containing DNA with the linkage through Lys142 (16Zharkov D.O. Gilboa R. Yagil I. Kycia J.H. Gerchman S.E. Shoham G. Grollman A.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14768-14778Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 19Zharkov D.O. Grollman A.P.

Chem. 1997; 272: 5335-5341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). However, these conclusions do not rule out the possibility that lysines other than Lys142 could also participate in catalyzing the β-elimination reaction, and none of these data reveal whether the reduction occurs at a pre- or postincision complex. The investigations presented here provide insights into the underlying structural chemistry of the glycosylase and lyase activities of MutY. Materials—All DNA substrates were synthesized by standard phosphoramidite chemistry on a 394 DNA/RNA synthesizer (Applied Biosystems). 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2′-deoxyguanine phosphoramidite was purchased from Glen Research. DNA sequencing was performed using an ABI Prism 310 Genetic Analyzer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). All DNA syntheses and sequence analyses were performed by the NIEHS Center (Molecular Biology Core, Dr. Thomas G. Wood, Director, University of Texas Medical Branch). The plasmid pKKYEco (derivative of pKK223-3; Amersham Biosciences) containing the mutY gene was a gift from Drs. J. H. Miller and M. L. Michaels (UCLA). Adenine, NaBH4, and NaCNBH3 were purchased from Sigma. T4 polynucleotide kinase was purchased from New England Biolabs, Inc., and [γ-32P]ATP was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Site-directed Mutagenesis—In vitro site-directed mutagenesis was performed by polymerase chain reaction using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Synthetic oligonucleotides used to create the desired changes in the mutY gene were synthesized and purified by gel electrophoresis. Following mutagenesis, the sequence of the entire mutY gene or the region coding for the catalytic domain of MutY (cMutY) was verified by DNA sequence analyses. Amino acids Glu37 and Asp138 were independently changed to cysteines in MutY. In addition, E37S, D138N, K142A, and K20A mutations were engineered independently in cMutY. Protein Purification—Wild type MutY, cMutY, and the mutant forms of these were expressed in Escherichia coli strain CC104mutY-. MutY and cMutY were purified by sequential affinity chromatography (Q-Sepharose, SP-Sepharose, and single-stranded DNA cellulose) as previously described (31Manuel R.C. Lloyd R.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11140-11152Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 33Manuel R.C. Czerwinski E.W. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol.

DNA Substrates—Heteroduplex DNAs used in enzymatic assays are listed in Table I.

The DNA substrate (0.5 nm) was reacted with the enzyme (200 nm) in a reaction buffer containing 25 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.8), 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. The 20-μl reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for various times. Aliquots of these reactions were further incubated for 15 min, at 90 °C with piperidine. The reactions were terminated with an equal volume of formamide buffer (95% formamide, 20 mm EDTA, 0.05% xylene cyanol, and 0.05% bromphenol blue) and heated at 90 °C for 4 min prior to separating the DNA reaction products through 15% polyacrylamide gels containing 7 m urea. The substrates and products of the incision reactions were analyzed by PhosphorImager analyses using ImageQuant Software (Amersham Biosciences). Guanine Glycosylase Assays—Duplex DNAs containing G opposite 8-oxoG were used to assay additional mismatch recognition and glycosylase activity (Table I, sequence 1). The strand containing the mismatched guanine was radiolabeled at the 5′-end with [γ-32P]ATP. Two sets of experiments were conducted in which guanine excision was monitored as a function of time or increasing concentrations of MutY. To monitor the kinetics of guanine excision, MutY (400 nm) was incubated with the DNA substrate (2 nm) in a buffer containing 25 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. Aliquots were withdrawn at specific times (0, 1, 5, 15, 30, 60, and 300 min) and treated with piperidine for 15 min at 90 °C. Quantitation of guanine glycosylase activity with increasing enzyme concentrations was performed using conditions described above except with different concentrations of MutY (0, 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100 nm). The mismatch cleavage reaction was allowed to proceed for 12 h at 37 °C, prior to the addition of the piperidine. Incubations with piperidine continued for another 15 min before they were terminated and quantitated as described above. Characterization of Schiff Base Intermediates—DNAs containing a single A:G or A:8-oxoG mismatch (Table I, sequences 1-3) were used in the following assay. The strand containing the mismatched adenine was 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP. The concentration of each enzyme (MutY, cMutY, cMutY-K142A, and cMutY-K20A) was 200 nm. Substrate DNA (5 nm) and the corresponding protein were incubated in a buffer containing 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, in the presence of 50 mm NaBH4 or 25 mm NaCNBH3. The 20-μl reaction volume was incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. The reactions were terminated with an equal volume of SDS buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 10 mm dithiothreitol, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.1% bromphenol blue) and boiled at 100 °C for 5 min. The covalently trapped protein-DNA complexes were resolved through 15% polyacrylamide gels and analyzed by PhosphorImager analyses. Trapping reactions were also performed in which the strand containing the mismatched adenine was 3′-end-labeled with [32P]cordycepin 5′-triphosphate and terminal transferase. DNA substrates were incubated with cMutY or cMutY-K20A in the presence of 50 mm NaBH4. The buffer components, reaction conditions, and analyses of the covalently trapped protein-DNA complexes were similar to that described above for the 5′-end-labeled DNA substrates. Crystallization and Structure Determination of K20A, K142A cMutY, and K20A cMutY-Adenine Complex—Crystals of K20A cMutY were obtained from a solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.2), 500 mm NaCl, 100 mm MgSO4, 1.2 m Li2SO4, and 10% ethylene glycol. For the K20A cMutY-adenine complex, the mother liquor was saturated with adenine. K142A cMutY was crystallized using a solution containing 100 mm imidazole/malate (pH 8.0), 45% saturated (NH4)2SO4, 500 mm NaCl, and 8% ethylene glycol. To obtain suitable crystals, initial crystals were used for microseeding. Data for K20A and K20A-adenine complex were collected on a Rigaku RU200 rotating anode generator with a Mar image plate detector and beamline 11-1 of the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory, respectively, and processed with Denzo and Scalepack (34Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). Data for cMutY K142A was collected at beamline 5.0.2 of the Advanced Light Source and processed with Mosflm and Scala. The structures were solved by molecular replacement using AmoRe with wild type cMutY as a search model (Protein Data Bank number 1MUY) (35Navaza J. Saludjian P.

This experimentally defined preservation of the folds and two-domain structures for these cMutY mutant enzymes suggests that biochemical investigations of these proteins should reflect the functional roles of the mutated residues rather than changes due to misfolding. These new structures and the original structural data are furthermore consistent with localizing the active site of MutY at the interdomain cleft region and suggest putative amino acid residues that contribute to the glycosylase and lyase chemistry of MutY (Fig. 1B) (12Guan Y. Manuel R.C. Arvai A.S. Parikh S.S. Mol C.D. Miller J.H. Lloyd S. Tainer J.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 1058-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The recent cocrystal structure of a thermophilic homolog of full-length MutY has also confirmed the general positioning of the extrahelical adenine (17Fromme J.C. Banerjee A. Huang S.J. Verdine G.L. Nature. 2004; 427: 652-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). It was hypothesized that Asp138 was the acidic residue that activates a water molecule for nucleophilic attack on the C1′ carbon of the deoxyribose sugar, facilitating the release of the mismatched adenine. Glu37 was hypothesized to protonate N7 of adenine during the nucleophilic displacement reaction. The presence of lyase activity in MutY and the ability of MutY to form Schiff base intermediates led to the hypothesis that an amine group from a side chain of a lysine in the vicinity of the trapped adenine could catalyze the β-elimination reaction. Further analyses of the adenine specificity pocket identified the ϵ-amino group of Lys142 as a candidate residue for the formation of the Schiff base intermediate. Williams and David (21Williams S.D. David S.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15417-15424Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) demonstrated that although various lysine mutants of MutY (K16A, K132A, K142A, K157G, and K158A) could nick DNA containing an A:8-oxoG mismatch, only K142A was diminished in the formation of a covalent intermediate in the presence of NaBH4. Additionally, we hypothesized that K20 located within the interdomain loop may modulate the reaction mechanism of MutY (Fig. 1B). The above hypotheses were tested by altering the putative catalytic residues by site-directed mutagenesis and analyzing the wild type and mutant active sites by x-ray crystallography and biochemical enzymology. The detailed atomic structures of cMutY K20A, K142A, and K20A with adenine are identical within experimental error to the cMutY D138N structure reported earlier (12Guan Y. Manuel R.C. Arvai A.S. Parikh S.S. Mol C.D. Miller J.H. Lloyd S. Tainer J.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 1058-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) except for informative local changes and interactions at the mutation site noted here. The crystal structures of cMutY-K20A and cMutY-K142A were determined to 1.9 and 1.8 Å, respectively (Table II, Fig. 2) to provide accurate positions for the mutated residue and its environment. In the wild type structure of cMutY, Lys20 is located on a loop that connects the two subdomains of the [4Fe-4S] cluster and six-helix barrel domain (Fig. 1). A hook, consisting of Lys28 or both Lys20 and Lys28 connects to the [4Fe-4S] domain at the Glu178 main chain through a water molecule, drawing the loop near the two subdomains (Fig. 2A). In D138N and K142A mutant structures, Lys20 twists up 90° toward the surface of the protein, whereas Arg19 turns in the opposite direction into the catalytic pocket (data not shown). The K20A substitution disturbs neither the vicinity of residue 20 nor the active site but is expected to increase flexibility due to the removal of Lys20-forming hydrogen bonds and destabilization of the linker-domain interactions (Fig. 2A). The three-dimensional conservation of the catalytic domain (12Guan Y. Manuel R.C. Arvai A.S. Parikh S.S. Mol C.D. Miller J.H. Lloyd S. Tainer J.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 1058-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) was also used to solve the crystal structure of cMutY in complex with adenine at 1.35 Å by molecular replacement, indicating that the K20A mutant retains the active site features suitable for adenine binding. In this very high resolution structure, the adenine position and interactions"

The eukaryotic and archaeal Mcm proteins have conserved helicase motifs and exhibit DNA helicase and ATP hydrolysis activities in vitro. Although the Mcm proteins have been proposed to be the replicative helicase, the enzyme that melts the DNA helix at the replication fork, their function during cellular DNA replication elongation is still unclear. Using nucleoplasmic extract (NPE) from Xenopus laevis eggs and six purified polyclonal antibodies generated against each of the Xenopus Mcm proteins, we have demonstrated that Mcm proteins are required during DNA replication and DNA unwinding after initiation of replication. Quantitative depletion of Mcms from the NPE results in normal replication and unwinding, confirming that Mcms are required before pre-replicative complex assembly and dispensable thereafter. Replication and unwinding are inhibited when pooled neutralizing antibodies against the six different Mcm2-7 proteins are added during NPE incubation. Furthermore, replication is blocked by the addition of the Mcm antibodies after an initial period of replication in the NPE, visualized by a pulse of radiolabeled nucleotide at the same time as antibody addition. Addition of the cyclin-dependent kinase 2 inhibitor p21(cip1) specifically blocks origin firing but does not prevent helicase action. When p21(cip1) is added, followed by the non-hydrolyzable analog ATPgammaS to block helicase function, unwinding is inhibited, demonstrating that plasmid unwinding is specifically attributable to an ATP hydrolysis-dependent function. These data support the hypothesis that the Mcm protein complex functions as the replicative helicase."

The subsequent metabolic retinoid cycle starts with Schiff base hydrolysis and release of photolyzed all-trans-retinal from the active site and ends with the uptake of fresh 11-cis-retinal. To probe chromophore-protein interaction in the active state, we have studied the effects of blue light absorption on metarhodopsin II using infrared and time-resolved UV-visible spectroscopy. A light-induced shortcut of the retinoid cycle, as it occurs in other retinal proteins, is not observed. The predominantly formed illumination product contains all-trans-retinal, although the spectra reflect Schiff base reprotonation and protein deactivation. By its kinetics of formation and decay, its low temperature photointermediates, and its interaction with transducin, this illumination product is identified as metarhodopsin III. This species is known to bind all-trans-retinal via a reprotonated Schiff base and forms normally in parallel to retinal release. We find that its generation by light absorption is only achieved when starting from active metarhodopsin II and is not found with any of its precursors, including metarhodopsin I. Based on the finding of others that metarhodopsin III binds retinal in all-trans-C15-syn configuration, we can now conclude that light-induced formation of metarhodopsin III operates by Schiff base isomerization (“second switch”).

Living cells react to stimuli, which are realized in physical or chemical signals and are often detected by specialized membrane receptor proteins.

The majority of signals are chemical ligands, such as hormones or pheromones, which reach their GPCR by diffusion and bind to a site near their extracellular surface (1Wess J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 346-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 2Ernst O.P. Bartl F.J. Chembiochem. 2002; 3: 968-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Photoreceptors contain a chromophore as a fixed prostethic group and are specialized for the detection of quanta of visible light in the environment (3Spudich J.L. Yang C.S. Jung K.H. Spudich E.N. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 365-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 4Hofmann K.P. Stavenga D.G. DeGrip W.J. Pugh E.N.J. Molecular Mechanism in Visual Transduction. 3. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam2000: 91-142Google Scholar). The first step in the signal transduction pathway mediated by these receptors is the generation of a short-lived electronically excited state caused by photon absorption to channel the energy into a conformationally and/or chemically altered state of chromophore-protein interaction (5Kandori H. Shichida Y. Yoshizawa T. Biochemistry (Mosc.). 2001; 66: 1197-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Although these early events of light absorption are lacking in ligand binding receptors, G-protein-coupled photoreceptors may use similar mechanisms to spread the local activation near the ligand binding site to the cytoplasmic binding sites, where the G-protein has access. In this view, the chromophore can be understood as a fixed ligand that becomes an agonist by light absorption. Because the isomerized chromophore is still light-sensitive, although at a wavelength different from the ground state, chromophore-protein interaction in the active state can be tested by light. Rhodopsin (Rh), the visual pigment in the disc membranes of retinal rods, consists of the apoprotein (termed opsin) and the visual chromophore, 11-cis-retinal, bound by a protonated Schiff base to Lys296 in the center of the seventh transmembrane helix (6Hargrave P.A. McDowell J.H. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1992; 137B: 49-97PubMed Google Scholar). X-ray analysis shows the retinal in a specialized pocket with strong hydrophobic interaction near the β-ionone ring and a stabilizing salt bridge between the protonated nitrogen of the Schiff base and its counterion, provided by the negatively charged carboxylic group on Glu113 in the third helix (7Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (4971) Google Scholar). In this environment, electronic relaxation on the excited-state potential surface allows fast initial motions of the retinal chromophore and leads the retinal to a region in the configurational space, where the transition to the all-trans-retinal product state can take place (8Xu D. Martin C. Schulten K. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 453-460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In the subsequent pathway, each of the intermediates (blue-shifted intermediate, bathorhodopsin (Batho), lumirhodopsin, metarhodopsin (Meta) I, and Meta II) is characterized by its own UV-visible absorption spectrum. The conversion into the activating conformation is marked by the near-UV absorbing Meta II intermediate, in which the Schiff base is still intact but deprotonated (9Matthews R.G. Hubbard R. Brown P.K. Wald G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1963; 47: 215-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Meta II is stabilized by either low pH or high temperature and remains in equilibrium with its Meta I predecessor (10Parkes J.H. Liebman P.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5054-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The large shift of the absorption maximum from 480 nm in Meta I to 380 nm in Meta II is due to deprotonation of the Schiff base and coupled to protonation of the counterion at Glu113. The resulting neutralization of Glu113 opens the stabilizing salt bridge, a necessary condition for forming the signaling state for the G-protein (see Ref. 11Menon S.T. Han M. Sakmar T.P. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1659-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). A second necessary step is proton uptake of Glu134, a conserved residue in the (D/E)RY motif found in many GPCRs, which is linked to a breakage of the hydrogen bonded network around this motif. This structure and the NPXXY(X)5,6F stretch that links helices VII and VIII and (D/E)RY exert a dual control, essential for reliable transformation of quiescent rhodopsin to active Meta II (12Fritze O. Filipek S. Kuksa V. Palczewski K. Hofmann K.P. Ernst O.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2290-2295Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). In turn, chromophore-protein interaction in Meta II is expected to depend on the activation state of these structures, although the mechanism of coupling is not yet clear. Understanding the active state and how it can form requires structural information on the Meta II intermediate and a comparison with the dark ground state. One way to approach the problem employs analogs of the native retinal. The chromophore pocket recombines strikingly well with analogs of the native 11-cis-retinal, such as 9-cis-retinal, 10-methyl retinal, or 9-demethyl retinal, and even with “locked” retinals, which have a ring-like bridge between C10 and C13 of two to four carbons. The main effect of the modifications in these analogs occurs in the active state and has led to the concept of the modified retinals being “partial agonists,” in analogy to the term used for diffusible ligands (4Hofmann K.P. Stavenga D.G. DeGrip W.J. Pugh E.N.J. Molecular Mechanism in Visual Transduction. 3. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam2000: 91-142Google Scholar, 13Meyer C.K. Böhme M. Ockenfels A.

These studies have already suggested that the retinal in the active state may build up new interactions that are absent in the dark ground state. Interactions may now be stronger near the center of the retinal polyene, where the modifications are placed to which Meta II is sensitive. The present investigation addresses this problem using a quite different approach. Rather than employing synthetic constraints on the retinal moiety, it uses the native chromophore and studies the constraints exerted by the protein itself. The actinic light is applied in the active state. This enables us to measure the constraints that come into play when the active state is left, rather than when it is formed. These new constraints may then be compared with those seen in the ground state, where the structural limitations are known. The basic technique of probing the active site by blue light (λ < 420 nm) illumination of the Meta II state dates back to the 1960s (9Matthews R.G. Hubbard R. Brown P.K. Wald G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1963; 47: 215-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 16Williams T.P. Vision Res. 1968; 8: 1457-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Later, when Rh was recognized as a GPCR, it was used to study the influence of G-protein on the blue light-induced reaction (17Arnis S. Hofmann K.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9333-9340Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The general observation in these studies is that after illumination, Meta II goes through a shift of the absorption maximum, indicating reprotonation of the retinal Schiff base and proton release, i.e. just the inverse of the proton transfer reactions observed in the forward pathway. Because the absorption change was partially inhibited by G-protein (17Arnis S. Hofmann K.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9333-9340Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and C-terminal peptides (18Ernst O.P. Meyer C.K. Marin E.P. Henklein P. Fu W.Y. Sakmar T.P. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1937-1943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), it was assumed that up to ∼50% an inactive product (P subspecies with λmax = 500 nm (P500); P is used henceforth to represent the blue light illumination product of Meta II) was formed that does not interact with the G-protein. It was thus generally assumed that blue light absorption can revert the forward pathway (see Refs. 17Arnis S. Hofmann K.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9333-9340Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar and 18Ernst O.P. Meyer C.K. Marin E.P. Henklein P. Fu W.Y. Sakmar T.P. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1937-1943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), as it does in bacteriorhodopsin or halorhodopsin. However, a more recent analysis based on Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and retinal extraction has shown that this does not apply to vertebrate rhodopsin. The spectral features in the chromophore “fingerprint” region indicating reversal of the changes in retinal geometry and retinal-protein interaction were lacking in the difference spectra. The data showed that most of the retinal was still in the all-trans-retinal configuration, as it was in the Meta II state, from which the reaction had started. The spectral features that reflect the activating changes in the protein backbone were, however, fully reversible (19Bartl F.J. Ritter E. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30161-30166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The data allowed the conclusion that (i) the conditions imposed on the retinal in the active state are such that isomerization around a central double bond does not occur to a significant degree and (ii) rhodopsin can be switched between an active and an inactive state without such isomerization. In this study and the accompanying article (44.Zimmermann, K., Ritter, E., Bartl, F. J., Hofmann, K. P., and Heck, M. J. Biol. Chem. 279, 48112-48119Google Scholar), we wanted to further explore the nature of the alterations in chromophore-protein interaction behind the “second switch” and the properties of the intermediate formed, respectively. We had previously noted that the product formed by blue light illumination of Meta II is similar to that arising from its thermally activated decay. This is the metarhodopsin III (Meta III) intermediate, a “retinal storage” product that forms in parallel to the pathway through Schiff base hydrolysis and release of the photolyzed retinal from the active site. In Meta III, retinal remains covalently bound, still in the trans configuration, but with the retinylidene linkage reprotonated (19Bartl F.J. Ritter E. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30161-30166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 20Heck M. Schädel S.A. Maretzki D. Bartl F.J. Ritter E. Palczewski K. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol.

Visual Neurosci. 2003; 20: 249-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Vogel et al. (22Vogel R. Siebert F. Mathias G. Tavan P. Fan G. Sheves M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9863-9874Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) have recently shown that Meta III harbors the retinal in an all-trans-15-syn-retinal configuration, in which the Schiff base bond and not the central C11=C12 double bond is isomerized. This gives us the chance to identify the Meta III arising from blue light illumination of Meta II and to come closer to an understanding of this product, which is of interest both for its interesting mechanism of formation and for its potentially important role in the regeneration of a light-sensitive photoreceptor. Preparation of Samples—Rod outer segments were prepared from fresh, dark-adapted retinae of cattle eyes (23Papermaster D.S. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 81: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Rhodopsin disc membranes were subsequently purified by repetitive washes with a low ionic strength buffer (24Sachs K. Maretzki D. Hofmann K.P. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 238-251Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Opsin membranes were prepared from rhodopsin membranes by bleaching, extraction of retinals with hydroxylamine, and repetitive washes with fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin. All membrane suspensions were stored at -80 °C. Rhodopsin with isotopically labeled retinals was prepared by reconstitution of opsin with a 3-fold excess of the labeled retinal at 8 °C for 10 h. Excess retinal was subsequently removed by repetitive washes with 2% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin. Isotopically labeled retinals were a generous gift from Mordechai Sheves. BTP was used as buffer. pH was adjusted with diluted NaOH or HCl. Deuterated samples were prepared by repetitive washes of the rhodopsin membranes with BTP buffer prepared in D2O. pD in deuterated samples was adjusted with diluted NaOD or DCl. All steps were performed under dim red light (λ > 640 nm). FTIR Measurements—The sample (200 μm rhodopsin membrane suspension) was centrifuged for 30 min at 100,000 × g and 4 °C to obtain a 2.4 mm rhodopsin pellet (25Bartl F. Ritter E. Hofmann K.P. FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 259-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was transferred to a temperature-controlled (±0.5 °C) transmission cuvette with two BaF2 windows and a 3-μm polytetrafluorethylene spacer. For infrared spectroscopy, we used a Bruker ifs 66v spectrometer equipped with a liquid nitrogen-cooled HgCdTe detector (J15D-series; EG&G Judson). Before the measurement, the sample was equilibrated for at least 30 min in the spectrometer. Illumination was performed with a 150-watt fiberoptic light source (Spindler & Hoyer) equipped with a heat reduction filter (Schott KG2). Additionally, the following filters were used: a 495 nm long pass filter (Schott GG495) for illumination of Rh and Meta III at room temperature, a 400 ± 20 nm band pass filter (combination of Schott UG1 and fiber optics) for illumination of Meta II, a 480 ± 2 nm band pass filter for illumination of Meta I, a 470-480 nm band pass filter for illumination of Rh or Meta III at 80 K, a 530 nm long pass filter for illumination of Batho, and a 480 ± 5 nm filter for the illumination of Meta III at 173 K and 273 K. Illumination times were 4 s for Rh, 40 s for Meta II, and 20 s for Meta III, unless noted otherwise. Measurements at low temperatures were performed using an Oxford Instruments Optistat DN variable temperature liquid nitrogen cryostat. Infrared absorbance spectra (256 scans; spectral resolution, 2 cm-1) were recorded before (stage A) and after (stage B) illumination. The difference spectrum was calculated by subtracting the spectrum measured after illumination from the spectrum measured before illumination, unless noted otherwise. Henceforth, it will be termed the “B minus A” difference spectrum for the conversion A→ B. UV-visible Measurements—For measurements in the spectral range between 200 and 800 nm, the same sample preparation and centrifugation procedure as described for FTIR were used. Pellets (∼2 mm) were transferred to a temperature-controlled transmission cuvette made of two 10-mm-diameter BaF2 windows with a 50-μm polytetrafluorethylene spacer. An OLIS RSM-16 spectrometer was used for data aquisition. Spectra were recorded with a time resolution of 1 ms, and the total data collection time was 1 s. Flash illumination of the sample was done with a Rapp flash lamp (Rapp OptoElectronic GmbH). A 480 nm short-wave cutoff filter was used for illumination of Rh and Meta III, and a 400-450 nm band pass filter was used for illumination of Meta II. Duration of the flash was 2 ms. During the flash, the detector was protected by a shutter. The first 11 ms after flash excitation were not recorded due to influence of the shutter on the detector signal. The measurements in Fig. 4 were performed on membrane suspensions as described in the accompanying article (44.Zimmermann, K., Ritter, E., Bartl, F. J., Hofmann, K. P., and Heck, M. J. Biol. Chem. 279, 48112-48119Google Scholar). The UV-visible spectra in Fig. 1A were recorded from native disc membranes using the OLIS spectrometer and FTIR sample preparations to make them comparable with the FTIR data (see the text below and “Experimental Procedures”). Dark-adapted Rh exhibits an absorption maximum of 500 nm. Illumination of Rh (pathway a) generates the active Meta II intermediate (380 nm). When the Meta II sample is subsequently illuminated with blue light (pathway b), the absorption maximum is shifted to the 475 nm region (blue light product P). Even saturating blue light illumination does not recover the 500 nm absorption maximum of Rh. However, when blue light product P is illuminated with green light (>500 nm), a Meta II-like product absorbing at 380 nm is formed (pathway c). On the basis of the UV-visible data shown in Fig. 1A, the scheme in Fig. 1B was deduced. Pathway a is the normal activating pathway of Rh. Pathway b is the blue light-induced formation of the P product (P-Meta III), which shows the same absorption maximum as the thermal decay product Meta III (T-Meta III). Pathway c illustrates that, as with Meta III (9Matthews R.G. Hubbard R. Brown P.K. Wald G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1963; 47: 215-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 20Heck M. Schädel S.A.

Chem. 2001; 276: 30161-30166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The time-resolved difference spectra in Fig. 1C, a (Meta II minus Rh) were taken at pH 5.5 and 10 °C every 20 ms after flash illumination of Rh with green light. In the first trace (20 ms), the pronounced negative band at 520 nm is due to the decrease of the 500 nm absorption of Rh. The 20 nm red shift can be explained by the overlap with a positive band at 480 nm caused by the formation of Meta I within microseconds after illumination. The rise of the 380 nm absorption in the subsequent traces reflects an increasing amount of Meta II, which appears within milliseconds in the equilibrium with Meta I. The corresponding decrease of 475 nm absorption and the isosbestic point at 417 nm, characteristic for the Meta I/Meta II equilibrium, are clearly seen. After 140 ms, only a minor amount of Meta I is present in the equilibrium; therefore, the spectrum reflects the transition from Rh to Meta II characterized by the negative band at 500 nm and the positive band at 380 nm, respectively. When the sample is subsequently flashed with blue light, the difference spectra in Fig. 1C, b (Meta II minus P) are recorded. The absorption change back to the 475 nm region (forming the blue light product P) is much faster than that linked to Meta II formation (compare the traces in a and b of Fig. 2C) and could not be time-resolved with the available experimental setup. However, the difference spectra shown in Fig. 1C, c (Meta II minus P), which arise from subsequent green light flash illumination of the P product (λmax = 475 nm), show similar kinetics as the Meta I/Meta II equilibrium (shown in Fig. 1C,a) and can be time-resolved again with our experimental setup. According to available UV-visible and FTIR (shown in Fig. 1, C and D) data, this recovers Meta II. The data show that illumination of Rh and formation of Meta II lead to a photoreversible reaction pathway between Meta II and P that does not recover the 500 nm absorption maximum of Rh. Analogous to Fig. 1C, the FTIR difference spectra in Fig. 1D are from green light illumination of Rh (Fig. 1D, a), subsequent blue light illumination of Meta II (Fig. 1D, b), and green light illumination of its product, P (Fig. 1D, c), respectively. Again, the spectra for the Meta II→ P conversions (compare Fig. 1C, b and c) are fully reversible, in contrast to the difference spectra for the Rh→ Meta II conversion. The photoreversibility is specifically seen in characteristic bands at 1745, 1713, and 1644 cm-1, reflecting changes in protonation states, hydrogen bonding, the secondary structure of the protein, and also the chromophore fingerprint, including bands at 1348 and 1181 cm-1. These fingerprint characteristics are lacking in the Meta II minus Rh difference spectrum of the first illumination and are replaced with features such as the negative band at 1238 cm-1 and the spectral pattern around it, reflecting the well-known change in the 11-cis to all-trans geometry of the retinal that triggers activation of Rh from the dark ground state (19Bartl F.J. Ritter E. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30161-30166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). From previous work (16Williams T.P. Vision Res. 1968; 8: 1457-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 17Arnis S. Hofmann K.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9333-9340Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), it is known that the first Schiff base reprotonated products of Meta II illumination include P subspecies with λmax = 470 nm (P470) and P500, in which the suffix denotes the absorption maxima of these products in detergent solution. Both in solution and in native membranes, as used in this study, two products are kinetically distinguishable (with formation times of <1 and 20 ms, respectively) and exhibit different sensitivity toward the retinal G-protein (transducin) and its C-terminal peptides (17Arnis S. Hofmann K.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9333-9340Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 19Bartl F.J. Ritter E. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30161-30166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, in native membranes, an apparently uniform product with λmax = 475 nm is formed (Fig. 1A), suggesting that the two species are more isochromic under these conditions. We know that formation of the fast product is not linked to a change in activity, despite its UV-visible absorption that indicates Schiff base reprotonation. Consistently, it does not contribute much to the FTIR difference spectrum. We will therefore focus on the product P formed with a change in activity and neglect the fast “hybrid” side product, which remains Meta II-like by its structure but contains a protonated Schiff base. The following experiments were undertaken to explore how the P product, which we will term P-Meta III, relates to the normal Meta III arising from thermal decay of Meta II (T-Meta III; see Fig. 1B). Light-induced Pathways—P-Meta III and T-Meta III were illuminated at low temperatures, and the respective intermediates were stabilized at 80 K, 173 K, 273 K, and 293 K. The amount of P-Meta III formed is ∼70%; the amount of T-Meta III formed is only 30%. The spectra were therefore normalized using the band at 1348 cm-1. In the difference spectra of the intermediates (Fig. 2), blue represents the intermediate minus P-Meta III difference spectrum, and red represents the intermediate minus T-Meta III difference spectrum. P-Meta III and T-Meta III form very similar intermediates. Slight differences, especially in the spectra of the intermediates at 173 K and 273 K, can be attributed in part to different content of residual cis isomers, which are able to regenerate with opsin to form Rh and isorhodopsin (Iso), and to deviations in water content. The spectra are surprisingly similar to the spectra of the corresponding intermediates generated by Rh illumination (Fig. 2, black), termed Batho, lumirhodopsin, Meta I, and Meta II, apart from bands in the region between 1348 and 1100 cm-1, which are related to retinal geometry or retinal protein interaction. The intermediates at 80 K show positive bands for both pathways at 1688, 1670, and 1653 cm-1 and a negative band at 1662 cm-1. This spectral region is dominated by the amide I bands of the protein. The low intensities of these bands show that, similar to the Batho intermediate, structural changes of the protein only occur to a limited extent. There is an intense negative band at 1559 cm-1 and an intense positive band at 1535 cm-1 characteristic for changes in the C=C stretching mode of the retinal and similar to those observed in the Batho minus Rh intermediate. However, the negative band at 1238 cm-1 and the spectral pattern around it, which are characteristic for retinal 11-cis/all-trans isomerization, are lacking in these spectra. This pattern is replaced with bands at 1348, 1181, 1191, and at 1198 cm-1. This observation was interpreted as a deactivating movement of the chromophore different from the cis/trans isomerization (19Bartl F.J. Ritter E. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2032815179,"Antithrombin (AT) inhibits most of the serine proteases generated in the blood coagulation cascade, but its principal targets are factors IXa, Xa, and thrombin. Heparin binding to AT, via a specific pentasaccharide sequence, alters the conformation of AT in a way that promotes efficient inhibition of factors IXa and Xa, but not of thrombin. The conformational change most likely to be relevant to protease recognition is the expulsion of the N-terminal portion of the reactive center loop (hinge region) from the main beta-sheet A. Here we investigate the hypothesis that the exosites on the surface of AT are accessible for interaction with a protease only when the hinge region is fully extended, as seen in the related Michaelis complex between heparin cofactor II and thrombin. We engineered a disulfide bond between residues 222 on strand 3A and 381 in the reactive center loop to prevent the extension of the hinge region upon pentasaccharide binding. The disulfide bond did not significantly alter the ability of the variant to bind to heparin or to inhibit thrombin. Although the basal rate of factor Xa inhibition was not affected, that of factor IXa inhibition was reduced to the limit of detection. In addition, the disulfide bond completely abrogated the pentasaccharide accelerated inhibition of factors Xa and IXa. We conclude that AT hinge region extension is the activating conformational change for inhibition of factors IXa and Xa, and propose models for the progressive and activated AT Michaelis complexes with thrombin, factor Xa, and factor IXa."
https://openalex.org/W1972471009,"Scaffold proteins play pivotal roles during signal transduction. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the Ste5p scaffold protein is required for activation of the mating MAPK cascade in response to mating pheromone and assembles a G protein-MAPK cascade complex at the plasma membrane. To serve this function, Ste5p undergoes a regulated localization event involving nuclear shuttling and recruitment to the cell cortex. Here, we show that Ste5p is also subject to two types of phosphorylation and increases in abundance as a result of MAPK activation. During vegetative growth, Ste5p is basally phosphorylated through a process regulated by the CDK Cdc28p. During mating pheromone signaling, Ste5p undergoes increased phosphorylation by the mating MAPK cascade. Multiple kinases of the mating MAPK cascade contribute to pheromone-induced phosphorylation of Ste5p, with the mating MAPKs contributing the most. Pheromone induction or overexpression of the Ste4p Gβ subunit increases the abundance of Ste5p at a post-translational step, as long as the mating MAPKs are present. Increasing the level of MAPK activation increases the amount of Ste5p at the cell cortex. Analysis of Ste5p localization mutants reveals a strict requirement for Ste5p recruitment to the plasma membrane for the pheromone-induced phosphorylation. These results suggest that the pool of Ste5p that is recruited to the plasma membrane selectively undergoes feedback phosphorylation by the associated MAPKs, leading to an increased pool of Ste5p at the site of polarized growth.

Upon binding of mating pheromone to a G protein-coupled receptor of the serpentine family, the Gβγ (Ste4p/Ste18p) dimer of the G protein is released from an inhibitory Gα subunit (Gpa1p) and activates a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; GST, glutathione S-transferase; NLS, nuclear localization signal; HA, hemagglutinin.1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; GST, glutathione S-transferase; NLS, nuclear localization signal; HA, hemagglutinin. cascade. The MAPK cascade consists of a MAPKKK Ste11p, a MAPKK Ste7p, and two MAPKs, Fus3p and Kss1p, of which Fus3p is the major MAPK. The relay of the signal through the MAPK cascade is achieved through sequential phosphorylation of each kinase. Previous work has established that the Ste5p scaffold is essential for this signal relay and plays two distinct roles: Ste5p binds to Ste11p, Ste7p, and Fus3p and tethers them into an active complex. In addition, Ste5p binds to the Gβ subunit of the activated G protein and enables Ste11p to be activated by Ste20p, a p21-activated protein kinase that is enriched at the plasma membrane through its association with Cdc42p, a Rhotype GTPase.A variety of evidence argues that it is the interaction between a RING-H2 domain in Ste5p and the Gβ subunit (Ste4p) that allows for the assembly of the associated MAPK cascade near Ste20p at the plasma membrane (18Inouye C.

Cell. 1999; 98: 501-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). During vegetative growth, Ste5p continuously shuttles between cytoplasm and nucleus. In response to mating pheromone, a pool of Ste5p that is derived from the nucleus is recruited to Ste4p at the plasma membrane.Despite the pivotal role of Ste5p in regulating the mating MAPK cascade, little is known about how it is regulated at a molecular level. The active form of Ste5p is an oligomer, which may also shuttle and be recruited to the plasma membrane (13Wang Y. Elion E.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2543-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 22Yablonski D. Marbach I. Levitzki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 313-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), however, in vivo evidence in support of such a feedback regulatory mechanism has been lacking. Previous work suggests that the bulk pool of Ste5p is phosphorylated on at least 15 serine and threonine residues during vegetative growth (25.Hasson, M. S. (1992) Analysis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pheromone Response: Biochemical and Genetic Characterization of the Ste5 Protein. Ph.D. thesis, University of California, Berkeley, CAGoogle Scholar), however, phosphorylation as a result of mating pheromone was not detected. To better understand how Ste5p phosphorylation is regulated, we devised a methodology that allows reproducible detection of phosphorylated forms of Ste5p expressed at native levels in vivo both during vegetative growth and pheromone signaling. Using this methodology, we find that Ste5p is phosphorylated by two distinct sets of kinases during vegetative growth and in response to mating pheromone. Pheromone-induced phosphorylation requires plasma membrane localization of Ste5p and is primarily regulated by the mating MAPKs with additional input by upstream kinases. Moreover, the mating MAPKs positively regulate the abundance of Ste5p at a post-translational step during pheromone stimulation, suggesting a potential level of feedback control that could be regulated by phosphorylation.MATERIALS AND METHODSStrains and Plasmids—See Table I for a list of yeast strains and plasmids used in this study. Yeast strains were grown in standard selective synthetic complete (SC) media. Strains transformed with PGAL-driven genes were pre-grown in 2% raffinose medium, and then switched to 2% galactose medium to induce transcription. MAPK cascade kinase deletion strains carrying an additional copy of the STE12 gene under control of a leaky GAL1 promoter (pNC252) were grown in 2% dextrose medium, which permitted low-level transcription of STE12. The leaky GAL1 promoter was confirmed in a growth test using a PFUS1-HIS3 reporter gene. Pheromone induction was performed at a cell density of ∼A600 1.0 for 1 h with 250 nm α-factor (C. Dahl, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA) for bar1Δ cells and 5 μm for BAR1 cells, unless indicated otherwise. In some instances, mating pathway activation employed overexpression of the STE4 genes as follows: cells carrying PGAL-STE4 (pL19) were grown in 2% raffinose medium to a cell density of ∼A600 0.8, then switched to 2% galactose medium for 4 h prior to a 1-h α-factor exposure. Cells carrying temperature-sensitive mutations were grown at room temperature, and then shifted to 37 °C for 4 h. Transformation of yeast was performed as described (26Baker R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) with the addition of 40 mm dithiothreitol upon plasmid DNA incubation. Standard cloning techniques were used to construct all plasmids. pCU-NLSK128T-S5-M9 was made by swapping a 1.2-kb AFLII-SphI fragment of pSKM96 (S. Mahanty) into pSKM12 (9Mahanty S.K. Wang Y.

Errede Open table in a new tab Assessment of Ste5p Abundance—Cells harboring GAL1-STE4 (pL19) and STE5-MYC9 (pSKM49 or pSKM92) were grown in SC selective medium containing 2% raffinose to an A600 of ∼0.75, then pelleted and resuspended in fresh medium containing 2% galactose and induced for 4 h with shaking at 30 °C, followed by treatment with α factor for the indicated times. The cycloheximide experiments were done by growing cells in SC selective medium containing 2% dextrose or 2% galactose to an A600 ∼ 0.75, then treated with 10 mg/ml cycloheximide and 50 nm α factor in the indicated order for the indicated lengths of time. Whole cell extracts were prepared as previously described by glass bead breakage (29Elion E.A. Satterberg B. Kranz J.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 495-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) in the described buffer with addition of 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm benzamidine, 4 mm 1,10-phenanthroline, 50 mm NaF, 1:100 dilution of phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Sigma P2850). Decreased total protein recovered from cycloheximide-treated cells provided evidence that translation had been inhibited. The pulse expression experiments were done by expressing STE5-MYC9 from the GAL1 promoter for 1.5 h in SC selective medium containing 2% galactose to an A600 ∼ 0.5, removing an aliquot, then pelleting the cells at room temperature and resuspending them in prewarmed SC selective medium at pH 4 containing 2% glucose, with or without 2 μm α factor. The inclusion of 150 mm NaCl or greater in the breaking buffer was essential for efficient recovery of Ste5 protein and detection of increases in abundance after α factor treatment.Northern Analysis—Northern analysis was performed as described (30Elion E.A. Warner J.R. Cell. 1984; 39: 663-673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). STE5 mRNA was detected with an internal 1.5-kb KpnI-SalI fragment from STE5, and FUS3 mRNA was detected with a 3.0-kb EcoRI-EcoRI fragment from pYEE93 (31Elion E.A. Grisafi P.A. Fink G.R. Cell. 1990; 60: 649-664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). DNA fragments were purified from low melting agarose gels, radiolabeled by the hexamer labeling method, then purified by ethanol precipitation with carrier tRNA.Gel-shift Assays—A Myc-tagged Ste5p (Ste5-Myc9p (9Mahanty S.K. Wang Y. Farley F.W. Elion E.A. Cell. 1999; 98: 501-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar)) that is fully functional and expressed at native levels was used for the analysis. For whole cell extractions, equal numbers of cells were normalized by cell density, washed in ice-cold H2O containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, resuspended in SDS-loading buffer containing 60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol and bromphenol blue, and then broken by vortexing with acid-washed glass beads (Sigma). The lysates were boiled then electrophoresed on 7.5% SDS-PAGE gels. Immunoblots were probed with 9E10 mAb (Harvard University Monoclonal Antibody facility; cell supernatant, 1:25 dilution) and αTcm1 mAb (J. Warner, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY; 1:10,000 dilution). Immunoreactivity was detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Bio-Rad) using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences).Phosphatase Treatment of Ste5-MYC9p Immune Complexes—Whole cell extracts were prepared exactly as described above except the extraction buffer contained 0.14% β-mercaptoethanol and no bromphenol blue. 150 μl of protein extract from 20 A600 units worth of cells was diluted 1:20 in modified H buffer (29Elion E.A. Satterberg B. Kranz J.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 495-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) that also contained 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm benzamidine, and 1 mm EDTA. Immunoprecipitations of Ste5-MYC9p were carried out as described (29Elion E.A. Satterberg B. Kranz J.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 495-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) using 60 μl of 9E10 cell supernatant and 50 μl of Protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma). Ste5-MYC9p immunoprecipitates were washed in dephosphorylation buffer (40 mm PIPES, pH 6.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and protease inhibitors (leustatin, pepstatin, chymostatin, papain, 10 μg/ml each)). Each reaction used ⅓ of the immune complexes and 0.35 unit of acid phosphatase from potato (Fluka) dissolved in storage buffer containing 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 50% glycerol. In addition, the phosphatase inhibitors, 50 mm NaF and 10 mm orthovanadate, were added where indicated. The reactions were performed at 4 °C and inactivated after 1 h by boiling the immune complexes in SDS loading buffer at 95 °C for 10 min. Immunoblot analysis was performed as described above. Bacterial alkaline phosphatase and protein phosphatase 2 were less effective at dephosphorylating Ste5-MYC9p in other experiments. 2H. Sadhegi and E. Elion, unpublished data.Kinase Assays—Fus3-HAp, Fus3K42R-HAp, and GST-Ste5p immune complexes were prepared from whole cell extracts as described (24Kranz J.E. Satterberg B. Elion E.A.

Cell. 1993; 4: 495-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Duplicate immune complexes were analyzed by immunoblot analysis using 12CA5 monoclonal antibody to detect Fus3-HAp and Fus3K42R-HAp and anti-GST antiserum to detect GST and GST-Ste5p.Visualization of Ste5-GFP and Ste5-Myc9p—WT and STE11-4 cells harboring either Ste5-GFP (expressed at native levels from the CUP1 promoter) (9Mahanty S.K. Wang Y. Farley F.W. Elion E.A. Cell. 1999; 98: 501-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) or Ste5-Myc9p (expressed from a multicopy plasmid) (9Mahanty S.K. Wang Y. Farley F.W. Elion E.A. Cell. 1999; 98: 501-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) were grown to logarithmic phase, then induced with 50 nm α factor. Ste5-GFP samples were visualized by live cell microscopy, whereas Ste5-Myc9p samples were fixed and prepared for indirect immunofluoresence with 9E10 monoclonal antibody (1:1000 dilution of ascites fluid) and a rabbit anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated to CY3 (1:1000 dilution) essentially as described (9Mahanty S.K. Wang Y. Farley F.W. Elion E.A. Cell. 1999; 98: 501-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). 3M. Qi and E. Elion, submitted for publication. Samples were observed on an Axioskop 2 microscope (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) linked to a digital camera (C4742–95; Hamamatsu, Bridgewater, NJ).RESULTSThe Mating MAPKs Positively Regulate the Abundance of Ste5p Post-translationally—To study potential post-translational modification of Ste5p we expressed a fully functional tagged derivative of Ste5p (Ste5-MYC9p) (9Mahanty S.K. Wang Y. Farley F.W. Elion E.A. Cell. 1999; 98: 501-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) at native levels from a centromeric plasmid in a ste5Δ strain. Immunoblot analysis showed that the abundance of Ste5p increases as a result of mating pheromone stimulation, with the increase most apparent 1 h after α factor addition, as confirmed by reprobing for the ribosomal protein Tcm1p (Fig. 1A). Overexpression of the Ste4p Gβ subunit, which binds Ste5p, further increased the abundance of Ste5p in the presence of α factor (Fig. 1A) and was sufficient to increase the abundance of Ste5p in the absence of α factor (Fig. 1B). Similar increases in abundance were found for Fus3p (Fig. 1, A and B). The increase in Ste5p abundance was dependent on the mating MAPKs and was blocked in a fus3Δ kss1Δ double mutant (Fig. 1B). In contrast, the level of STE5 mRNA did not increase as a result of activation of the mating pathway, and was not affected by mutations in the mating MAPKs or STE12, whereas the level of FUS3 mRNA was increased by mating pheromone and decreased by mutations in STE5 and STE12 (Fig. 1C). These findings suggested that the increase in Ste5p protein was post-transcriptional.To determine whether the increase in Ste5p abundance might be post-translational, we treated cells with cycloheximide to block translation of Ste5p and then added α factor. Prior analysis has shown that α factor activation of the mating MAPKs still occurs in the presence of cycloheximide (32Farley F. Satterberg B. Goldsmith E.A. Elion E.A. Genetics. 1999; 151: 1425-1444PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis of the cycloheximide-treated cells revealed an increase in Ste5p abundance after α factor treatment (Fig. 1D), demonstrating that the increase is post-translational. To circumvent secondary effects of cycloheximide on the level of components in the pathway that activate the MAPKs, we also induced with α factor for 1 h before adding cycloheximide for another hour in wild type and fus3Δ kss1Δ cells. The level of Ste5p was still greater as a result of α factor induction with no increase in the absence of Fus3p and Kss1p (Fig. 1E). A pulse expression method was next used to determine whether Ste5p is stabilized during α factor induction (33Zhou P. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 284: 67-78PubMed Google Scholar). The transcription of the STE5-MYC9 gene was induced for 90 min with the GAL1 promoter. Further expression was repressed by the addition of dextrose and the abundance of Ste5-Myc9p was monitored for 150 min in cells treated with or without α factor. The level of Ste5-Myc9p fell to 24% of the initial level in the cells that had not been treated with α factor compared with a much smaller decline to ∼85% in the α factor-treated cells (Fig. 1, F and G). Thus, Ste5p abundance increases at a post-translational step as a result of activation of the mating MAPKs, possibly as a result of stabilization of Ste5p from degradation. However, these findings do not rule out the possibility that the α factor-induced increase in Ste5p abundance may also involve enhanced translation of STE5 mRNA, because the level of Ste5p increases at the earliest (10 min) time point after the shift to glucose in α factor-treated cells (Fig. 1F).Ste5p Is Rapidly and Specifically Modified in Response to Pheromone Signaling—Previous unpublished work in this laboratory suggested that Ste5p is modified in vivo in response to the α factor mating pheromone, but it was difficult to reproducibly detect the modified forms using conventional methods of extract preparation (34.Sadeghi, H. (1999) Detection of Possible Differences in Phosphorylation of Nuclear Versus Cytoplasmic Ste5 and Possible Physical Interactions with the CDKI Far1. Master thesis, Harvard UniversityGoogle Scholar) (note broad mobility of Ste5p in Fig. 1). To better capture the modification status of Ste5p we lysed cells directly in SDS-loading buffer and separated these lysates on SDS-PAGE gels. Under these conditions, we detected a pattern of at least two differently migrating species of Ste5p during vegetative growth, and this pattern shifted toward a slower migrating species in the presence of mating pheromone in addition to greater abundance (Fig. 2A). The difference in the migration pattern in the absence and presence of mating pheromone was highly reproducible and not attributed to differences in loading, as shown by the relative levels of Tcm1p.Fig. 2Modification of Ste5p during vegetative growth and in response to pheromone signaling. A, Ste5-MYC9p modification in the absence and presence of α factor is highly reproducible. Ste5-MYC9p was expressed from its native promoter on a CEN plasmid (pSKM12) in a MATa bar1Δ ste5Δ strain (EY1775) in the absence or presence of α-factor. B, α factor time course in the presence of cycloheximide. Vegetatively dividing cells were exposed to cycloheximide for 10 min, the culture was then split into aliquots and induced with α factor for the indicated times. C, effect of osmotic shock on Ste5p modification. Note: lane 1 is overloaded compared with the other lanes based on Ponceau S staining of the immunoblot. Vegetatively dividing ste5Δ cells (EY1775) expressing Ste5-MYC9p (pSKM12) were exposed to 0.4 m NaCl for the indicated times. D, Ste5-MYC9p modification in the S288C strain background. S288C cells (FLY93) expressing Ste5-MYC9p (pSKM49) were induced with 5 μm α factor for 10 min. Samples were prepared by vortexing, heating, and sonicating in loading buffer as described under “Materials and Methods.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To determine whether the modification on Ste5p was the result of an initial signaling event, we compared its mobility in an α factor time course of cells that had been pretreated with cycloheximide. An optimal shift in the Ste5p migration pattern was detected as early as 5 min after pheromone exposure, and this migration pattern was independent of the presence of cycloheximide (Fig. 2B, only +CHX data shown). 15 to 30 min after induction, the level of slower migrating Ste5p species declined slightly, but still remained detectably elevated after 60 min of α-factor exposure. These findings indicate that Ste5p modification occurs early in the signaling process and is not dependent upon transcriptional induction.To determine whether the Ste5p modification was specific to the mating pheromone stimulus, we tested whether stimuli that activate signaling pathways other than the mating MAPK cascade would affect Ste5p modification. When cells were exposed to osmotic stress conditions known to activate the high osmolarity growth pathway (i.e. 0.4 m NaCl), Ste5p did not undergo a mobility shift (Fig. 2C, although the abundance declined slightly at the 60-min time point). Similar results were obtained when cells were exposed to heat shock, which activates the protein kinase C pathway (data not shown). Therefore, the modification of Ste5p that occurs in the presence of mating pheromone is a specific consequ"

Meta III is a side product of the Meta II decay path and holds its retinal in the original binding site, with the Schiff base bond to the apoprotein reprotonated as in the dark ground state. It thus keeps the retinal away from the regeneration pathway in which the photolyzed all-trans-retinal is released. This study was motivated by our recent observation that Meta III remains stable for hours in membranes devoid of regulatory proteins, whereas it decays much more rapidly in situ. We have now explored the possibility of regulated formation and decay of Meta III, using intrinsic opsin tryptophan fluorescence and UV-visible and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. We find that a rapid return of Meta III into the regeneration pathway is triggered by the G-protein transducin (Gt). Depletion of the retinal storage is initiated by a novel direct bimolecular interaction of Gt with Meta III, which was previously considered inactive. Gt thereby induces the transition of Meta III into Meta II, so that the retinylidene bond to the apoprotein can be hydrolyzed, and the retinal can participate again in the normal retinoid cycle. Beyond the potential significance for retinoid metabolism, this may provide the first example of a G-protein-catalyzed conversion of a receptor.

Beyond the potential significance for retinoid metabolism, this may provide the first example of a G-protein-catalyzed conversion of a receptor. The visual pigment in retinal rods, rhodopsin, is an archetype of a G-protein-coupled receptor and belongs to the large class I of the G-protein-coupled receptor superfamily. Its chromophoric ligand, 11-cis-retinal, is responsible for the absorption of light and for the function as a photoreceptor. To make the receptor permanently available for light excitation, the retinal is bound to the opsin apoprotein by a covalent Schiff base linkage. However, in contrast to other retinal proteins, which serve biological functions from proton transport to archaeal phototaxis, the Schiff base is not unconditionally stable during the whole lifetime of the protein (see Ref. 1Spudich J.L. Yang C.S. Jung K.H. Spudich E.N. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 365-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Within minutes after light excitation and during the lifetime of the active, G-protein binding conformation, the linkage to the photoisomerized chromophore is broken by hydrolysis, and the photolyzed all-trans-retinal is released from the active site (see Refs. 2DeGrip W.J. Rothschild K.J. Stavenga D.G. DeGrip W.J. Pugh E.N.J. Molecular Mechanism in Visual Transduction. 3. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam2000: 1-54Google Scholar and 3Hofmann K.P. Stavenga D.G. DeGrip W.J. Pugh E.N.J. Molecular Mechanism in Visual Transduction. 3. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam2000: 91-142Google Scholar). The site is then filled with fresh 11-cis-retinal delivered by a specialized retinal metabolism that involves a complex enzymology in the distant cells of the pigment epithelium (see Ref. 4McBee J.K. Palczewski K. Baehr W. Pepperberg D.R. Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 2001; 20: 469-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). This so-called retinoid cycle is necessary because the retinal exchange mechanism in rhodopsin is exclusive and unidirectional, so that not even the absorption of blue light allows the restoration of the original 11-cis-retinal opsin complex. This is likely to be the price to be paid for the exceedingly stable ground state provided by the tight packing of this form of retinal in the apoprotein binding pocket (5Bartl F.J. Ritter E. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30161-30166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This work and the accompanying article by Ritter et al. (43Ritter E.

Chem. 2004; 279: 48102-48111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) deal with an intriguing and potentially important detail of the retinal cycle, namely, that not all of the rhodopsin activated by light is immediately subjected to regeneration and takes part in the retinal cycle. A substantial part of the retinal remains bound in a form termed metarhodopsin (Meta) 1The abbreviations used are: Meta, metarhodopsin; P-Meta, photogenerated metarhodopsin; FTIR, Fourier transform infrared; Gt, G-protein transducin; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. III, which follows on the active Meta II intermediate. The retinal cycle starts with light absorption in the inactive ground state of rhodopsin, in which 11-cis-retinal is bound by a protonated Schiff base linkage to Lys296 in the seventh of the transmembrane helices. After light-induced 11-cis-retinal/all-trans-retinal isomerization, the active Meta II state is formed within milliseconds. Specific interactions stabilizing the ground state are now broken in the protein and allow it to adopt a conformation in which the G-protein and also arrestin are recognized (see Refs. 2DeGrip W.J. Rothschild K.J. Stavenga D.G. DeGrip W.J. Pugh E.N.J. Molecular Mechanism in Visual Transduction. 3. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam2000: 1-54Google Scholar and 3Hofmann K.P. Stavenga D.G. DeGrip W.J. Pugh E.N.J. Molecular Mechanism in Visual Transduction. 3. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam2000: 91-142Google Scholar). Although the Schiff base is deprotonated in Meta II, thus breaking the central salt bridge between the Schiff base nitrogen and its counterion at Glu113, the all-trans-retinylidene linkage is still intact (see Ref. 6Menon S.T. Han M. Sakmar T.P. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1659-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). A rapid quench of the catalytic activity of rhodopsin is brought about by interaction with receptor kinase, which catalyzes phosphorylation of rhodopsin at C-terminal sites and initiates tight interaction with arrestin (see Ref. 7Maeda T. Imanishi Y. Palczewski K. Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 2003; 22: 417-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). All these interactions occur while rhodopsin is still in its active conformation (see Ref. 3Hofmann K.P. Stavenga D.G. DeGrip W.J. Pugh E.N.J. Molecular Mechanism in Visual Transduction. 3. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam2000: 91-142Google Scholar). Full deactivation requires release of the photolyzed all-trans-retinal from and uptake of fresh 11-cis-retinal into the retinal binding pocket, a sequential process for which a channeling of the chromophore through entrance and exit sites of rhodopsin was recently proposed (Ref. 8Schädel S.A.

Chem. 2003; 278: 24896-24903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar; for the physiological perspective, see Ref. 9Lamb T.D. Pugh Jr., E.N. Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 2004; 23: 307-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). However, parallel to hydrolysis and transition into the exit site, a fraction of the isomerized chromophore (up to 30% under cellular conditions) can also take a side tour through the Meta III state, in which the Schiff base linkage remains intact and is reprotonated. Recent work has provided evidence that Meta III arises from Meta I by isomerization around the Schiff base bond, so that the retinal polyene chain is in the all-trans configuration and the C15=N double bond is in the syn configuration (10Vogel R. Siebert F. Mathias G. Tavan P. Fan G. Sheves M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9863-9874Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 11Vogel R. Siebert F. Zhang X.Y. Fan G. Sheves M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9457-9466Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The presumed significance of the Meta III state lies in the fact that the chromophore is excluded for a certain time interval from the release reaction, thus avoiding accumulation of the toxic all-trans-retinal and blocking regeneration in a substantial fraction of the isomerized pigment (see Ref. 9Lamb T.D. Pugh Jr., E.N. Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 2004; 23: 307-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, however, Meta III is only transiently formed in situ and returns within minutes into the normal regeneration pathway, whereas it is much more stable in isolated disc membranes, which possess their native phospholipid and integral membrane inventory but are devoid of regulatory proteins. Under these conditions, it takes more than 1 h (t½ ≈ 100 min at 30 °C and pH 7.3) for Meta III to decay, longer than any of the physiological time constants of the retinal cycle. In this study, we will describe how the storage side pathway of the retinoid cycle is regulated. Surprisingly, we find that the G-protein transducin itself regulates the lifetime of Meta III.

Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 471-489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Illumination Protocol: Formation of Meta III—Suspensions of isolated disc membranes (50 μm rhodopsin) were briefly sonicated and adjusted to pH 6.0 (20 °C). Saturating photoactivation of rhodopsin was achieved by illumination of the membranes (10 s) with a 150-watt fiber optic light source filtered through a heat filter (Schott KG2) and a 495 nm long pass filter (Schott GG495). Immediately after illumination, the samples were rapidly adjusted to pH 8.0 in the dark. Under these conditions, thermal decay of Meta II results in the formation of about 40% Meta III (22Heck M. Schädel S.A. Maretzki D. Bartl F.J. Ritter E. Palczewski K. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3162-3169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). After completion of the decay reactions (60 min, 20 °C), the suspensions were stored on ice. Under this condition, half time of thermal decay of Meta III is about 7 days (see Fig. 1A). Control membranes containing no Meta III but fully decayed light-activated rhodopsin (opsin complexed with all-trans-retinal) were obtained by incubation of the illuminated membranes at 30 °C and pH 6.0 (60 min). After the incubation, the sample was adjusted to pH 8.0 and stored on ice. FTIR Spectroscopy—FTIR samples were prepared using a centrifugation method as described previously (23Bartl F. Ritter E. Hofmann K.P. FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 259-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In ∼40 μl of washed membranes (0.3 mm rhodopsin), the pH was adjusted to 7.5 with diluted NaOH or HCl. Subsequently, the suspension was centrifuged for 20 min at 80,000 × g, yielding a pellet containing ∼3 mm rhodopsin (calculated from the absorption at 500 nm). The buffer solution was removed, and the pellet was transferred to a 30-mm-diameter transmission cell with two BaF2 windows and a 3-μm Teflon spacer. The sample was then equilibrated for 1 h at 23 °C, and subsequently, a set of 256 transmission spectra was recorded. After illumination with a 150-watt fiber optic light source filtered through a heat filter (Schott KG2) and a 495 nm long pass filter, a second set of spectra was recorded. From these two sets of spectra, the Meta II minus rhodopsin difference spectrum was generated (we use the convention that the spectra of the conversion A→ B are calculated as B - A and termed B - A difference spectrum). A second illumination (400 nm) of the sample converts Meta II into P-Meta III (5Bartl F.J. Ritter E. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30161-30166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The sample was then allowed to decay for 2 h in the presence or absence of 4 mm Gtα-HAA. The decay was followed by recording sets of spectra every 2 min after the first illumination. After 2 h, final spectra of the decay product were taken, and the sample was illuminated with green light (495 nm) for 30 s. Subtraction of the decay product spectra (“after” minus “before” illumination) yielded the Meta II minus Meta III FTIR difference spectrum. UV-visible Spectroscopy—UV-visible absorbance spectra were measured using a Varian Cary 50 spectrometer (resolution, 1 nm; scan rate, 600 nm/min). Measurements were performed in isotonic buffer adjusted to the chosen pH values in temperature-controlled microcuvettes (100 μl, 1-cm path length). Alternatively, spectra were recorded using a Shimadzu UV-2501PC (resolution, 1 nm; scan rate, 600 nm/min) equipped with an integrating sphere. These measurements were performed in 1-ml cuvettes under continuous stirring and with 0.3 m sucrose added to the buffer to avoid aggregation of the membranes. Spectra were taken at the indicated times using suspensions of isolated disc membranes (5 μm rhodopsin) or Meta III preparations (obtained from 5 μm bleached rhodopsin; see Illumination Protocol Formation of Meta III). Difference spectra of the Meta III decay were obtained by subtracting the first spectrum recorded immediately after adjusting the pH or temperature of the samples (see Fig. 1B) or after addition of Gt or synthetic peptides to the suspensions (see Fig. 3A). The time-dependent change of absorbance at 475 nm yields the time course of Meta III decay (see Fig 3A, inset). The peptide-induced depletion of Meta III was also used to quantify the amount of Meta III when the decay reaction was too slow to follow directly. Briefly, aliquots were withdrawn at a given time after incubation of the membrane suspensions at the respective temperature. Immediately after addition of excess peptide (500 μm Gtα-HAA), a spectrum was taken and used as a baseline. The subsequent decay of Meta III was then followed spectroscopically, and the amount of Meta III was calculated from the maximum change of absorbance at 475 nm using ϵ = 40,000 m-1 cm-1 (24Kolesnikov A.V. Golobokova E.Y. Govardovskii V.I. Vis. Neurosci. 2003; 20: 249-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Fluorescence Measurements—The fluorescence assay of illuminated rhodopsin in isolated disc membranes is based on the relief from the quenching of opsin tryptophan fluorescence exerted by the retinal ligand and was applied to study the release of the chromophore from its binding pocket (25Heck M. Schädel S.A. Maretzki D. Hofmann K.P. Vision Res. 2003; 43: 3003-3010Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Fluorescence signals were detected with a SPEX Fluorolog 1680 instrument. Slits were set to 0.2 nm for excitation (λ = 300 nm) and 1 nm for emission (λ = 340 nm). Suspensions of isolated disc membranes (800 μl, 5 μm rhodopsin) in isotonic buffer were stirred continuously and incubated at 30 °C during the experiment. Reactions were started by illumination with a 150-watt fiber optic light source filtered through a heat filter (Schott KG2) and a 495 nm long pass filter (Schott GG495) in the absence or presence of Gtα-HAA peptide (100 μm). The time course of light-induced fluorescence change (F) was analyzed using a simple monoexponential function (Equation 1)[F]=[A](1−e−k2t)(Eq. 1) in which [A] represents the maximum amplitude of the fluorescence change, and k2 identifies the rate constant of the conversion of Meta II to opsin and all-trans-retinal (see the reaction scheme in Fig. 6). Addition of Gtα-HAA to Meta III induces formation of Meta II, which in turn decays to opsin and all-trans-retinal. Thus, the time course of Gtα-HAA-induced fluorescence change was analyzed using the equation describing product formation for a series of two first-order reactions (Equation 2) (see Ref. 26Schmid R. Sapunov V.N. Non-formal Kinetics. Verlag Chemie GmbH, Weinheim, Germany1982: 17Google Scholar)[F]=[A](1−1k1−k2(k2e−k1t−k1e−k2t))(Eq. 2) in which k1 represents the rate constant of the Meta III→ Meta II conversion (see Fig. 6). GDP Dissociation Assay—To monitor dissociation of GDP from the Gtα subunit, the release of [α-32P]GDP was quantified using the filter binding assay. Gt complexed with [α-32P]GDP was prepared by incubating Gtα (10 μm) with Gtβγ (15 μm), [α-32P]GTP (2–11 nm), and illuminated disc membranes (1 μm rhodopsin) for 1 h at 22 °C. After sedimentation of the membranes (3 min, 12,000 × g), the supernatant containing the [α-32P]GDP-loaded G-protein was removed and stored on ice. Measurements were performed with membrane suspensions (5 μm rhodopsin) and G-protein complexed with [α-32P]GDP (1 μm Gtα subunit) at 20 °C. Reactions were initiated either by illumination (10 s with white light, 100 watts) or by addition of the membrane suspension. Aliquots of 20 μl were withdrawn at the times indicated, filtered through Millipore cellulose nitrate filters (0.45 μm), and washed once with 1 ml of ice-cold buffer. The amount of G-protein complexed with [α-32P]GDP associated with the filter was measured by scintillation counting in a Beckman LS6500. Control measurements were performed with rhodopsin in the dark and with fully decayed light-activated rhodopsin (opsin/all-trans-retinal, see Illumination Protocol: Formation of Meta III). Stability of Meta III Depends on pH and Temperature—Meta III is formed by thermal decay of Meta II (or Meta I) within minutes (10Vogel R. Siebert F. Mathias G. Tavan P. Fan G. Sheves M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9863-9874Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 22Heck M. Schädel S.A. Maretzki D. Bartl F.J. Ritter E. Palczewski K. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3162-3169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Using isolated disc membranes, Meta III formation is essentially irreversible, i.e. Meta III is stable for hours at pH 8.0 (see below). This makes it easy to separate the formation and decay of Meta III from one another and to determine the rates of decay as a function of temperature or pH. Thus, a protocol was applied in which first Meta III was formed at pH 8.0 and 20 °C (i.e. where its formation is at a maximum) and then its decay was followed at various conditions. Decay of Meta III was followed spectroscopically by the decrease of absorbance at 475 nm (examples can be seen in Fig. 3A). Under conditions in which Meta III decay rates were too slow (t½ > 200 min) and affected by sedimentation, the amount of Meta III present at a given time was determined by the fast and quantitative peptide-induced Meta III depletion (Figs. 1A and 3). The dependence of Meta III decay on temperature and pH is shown in Fig. 1. The temperature dependence is quite pronounced, with an increase of the rate between 0 °C and 30 °C by more than a factor of 100. Monophasic fits to the data and representation of the resulting decay rates in form of an Arrhenius plot (Fig. 1A, right panel) allow us to estimate the activation energy (Ea) as 130 kJ/mol for the overall decay of Meta III to opsin and all-trans-retinal. The value is consistent with the previously reported Ea obtained with rat retinas (Ea = 134 kJ/mol) (27Ebrey T.G. Vision Res. 1968; 8: 965-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and significantly higher than the Ea of the decay of Meta II to opsin and all-trans-retinal measured under similar conditions (Ea = 67 kJ/mol; Ref. 22Heck M. Schädel S.A. Maretzki D. Bartl F.J. Ritter E. Palczewski K. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3162-3169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The high Ea obtained gives a first hint that the decay of Meta III involves a substantial change of protein conformation. As Fig. 1B shows, Meta III depends on pH as well, with a half time of ∼2 min at pH 5.5 and 60–90 min at neutral pH (30 °C). Note that the rate versus pH plot (Fig. 1B, right panel) does not allow us to determine a pK of the reaction because data for pH < 5.5 are uncertain, due to protein denaturation over the long measuring period. In any case, the pK is <6. Gtα C-terminal Peptide Accelerates the Decay of Meta III— FTIR spectroscopy is sensitive not only to the environment of the chromophore, but also to alterations of the protein structure that accompany the formation of an intermediate. Spectrum a in Fig. 2A represents the Meta II minus rhodopsin difference spectrum obtained when the rhodopsin dark ground state is photoactivated. It shows the typical fingerprint pattern around 1238 cm-1 characteristic for 11-cis/all-trans isomerization. Illumination of Meta II with blue light results in formation of P-Meta III (for details, see the accompanying article by Ritter et al., Ref. 43Ritter E. Zimmermann K. Heck M. Hofmann K.P. Bartl F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48102-48111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The P-Meta III minus Meta II difference spectrum of the Meta II→ P-Meta III conversion is shown in Fig. 2A, b (inverted for better comparison). It is characterized by the lack of bands around 1238 cm-1 and the appearance of a new band at 1348 cm-1 (5Bartl F.J. Ritter E. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30161-30166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These features were recently assigned to anti/syn isomerization of the retinal Schiff base (10Vogel R. Siebert F. Mathias G. Tavan P. Fan G. Sheves M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9863-9874Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The P-Meta III content in the sample was probed by its conversion to a Meta II-like intermediate on green light illumination of P-Meta III and subsequent recording of the Meta II minus P-Meta III difference spectrum as described previously (5Bartl F.J. Ritter E. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30161-30166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 22Heck M. Schädel S.A. Maretzki D. Bartl F.J. Ritter E. Palczewski K. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3162-3169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Consistent with the stability of thermally generated Meta III (T-Meta III; see the accompanying article by Ritter et al., Ref. 43Ritter E. Zimmermann K. Heck M. Hofmann K.P. Bartl F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48102-48111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), the difference spectrum recorded on illumination of the sample after 210 min identifies a significant fraction of P-Meta III still present in the sample (spectrum c in Fig. 2A still shows the 1348 cm-1 band). Interestingly, the decay of Meta III is significantly accelerated in the presence of Gtα-HAA. Illumination of a Gtα-HAA-containing sample after 120 min reveals a quantitative decay of P-Meta III (Fig. 2A, d) as indicated by the absence of the 1348 cm-1 absorption change. Light-induced changes in this spectrum can be explained by cis/trans isomerization of residual 11-cis-retinal and 9-cis-retinal identified by the bands at 1238 and 1206 cm-1. These cis-isomers may be generated by the illumination of free all-trans-retinal initially present in the dark-adapted sample. The result indicates that the peptide can influence the amount of P-Meta III once formed. Release of the chromophore from the active site can be monitored by the change of intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of opsin (Fig. 2B) (22Heck M. Schädel S.A. Maretzki D. Bartl F.J. Ritter E. Palczewski K. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3162-3169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Importantly, the strong quenching of Trp fluorescence exerted by all-trans-retinal bound in its original pocket is similar in all metarhodopsin intermediates (Meta I, Meta II, and Meta III). Using the fluorescence monitor, it was previously shown that interaction of Gtα-HAA with Meta II effectively blocks its conversion to Meta III, which is directly seen in the larger fluorescence increase in the presence of the peptide (Fig. 2B, trace a) as compared with the fluorescence change measured without peptide (Fig. 2B, trace b). A second illumination with green light after 60 min of decay converts the fraction of Meta III formed to Meta II, whose subsequent decay to opsin/all-trans-retinal gives rise to a further increase in fluorescence (Fig. 2B, trace c). The initial fast fluorescence decrease reflects the fast light-induced conversion of Meta III to Meta II (see Fig. 2A and the accompanying article by Ritter et al., Ref. 43Ritter E. Zimmermann K. Heck M. Hofmann K.P. Bartl F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48102-48111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), which is similar to the initial fast fluorescence change that accompanies the light-induced conversion of rhodopsin to Meta I and Meta II. These changes are small compared with the fluorescence change that accompanies the release of the chromophore, confirming that the chromophore maintains its quenching of Trp fluorescence through Meta II and Meta III. Trace b of Fig 2B shows that addition of Gtα-HAA after formation of Meta III induces an increase of Trp fluorescence to a level similar to that obtained when Meta II quantitatively decays into opsin and all-trans-retinal. As seen in the inset of Fig. 2B, the onset of the peptide-induced fluorescence increase is significantly delayed, demonstrating that at least two consecutive reaction steps with similar rate constants are involved in the release of the chromophore. The sigmoidal shape of fluorescence change is indeed well fitted by Eq. 2, which is based on a process with two irreversible consecutive reaction steps (see “Experimental Procedures” and Fig. 6). Thus, a mechanism can be excluded in which the peptide induces the direct decay of Meta III to opsin and all-trans-retinal. When Gtα-HAA was added after partial decay of Meta III, the amplitude of fluorescence increase was reduced. Thus, analogous to the protocol applied in UV-visible spectroscopy, the dependence of the peptide-induced fluorescence change on the incubation time could be used to analyze the stability of Meta III; the data thereby obtained (data not shown) yield a value of 77 min for the half-time of Meta III decay in the absence of Gtα-HAA (30 °C, pH 8.0), which is consistent with the results obtained by UV-visible spectroscopy"
https://openalex.org/W2046955904,"Cell migration is a well organized process regulated by the extracellular matrix-mediated cytoskeletal reorganization. The signaling adaptor protein Crk has been shown to regulate cell motility, but its precise role is still under investigation. Herein, we report that Crk associates with ERM family proteins (including ezrin, radixin, and moesin), activates RhoA, and promotes cell motility toward hyaluronic acid. The binding of Crk with ERMs was demonstrated both by transient and stable protein expression systems in 293T cells and 3Y1 cells, and it was shown that v-Crk translocated the phosphorylated form of ERMs to microvilli in 3Y1 cells by immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy. This v-Crk-dependent formation of microvilli was suppressed by inhibitors of Rho-associated kinase, and the activity of RhoA was elevated by coexpression of c-Crk-II and ERMs in 3Y1 cells. In concert with the activation of RhoA by Crk, Crk was found to associate with Rho-GDI, which has been shown to bind to ERMs. Furthermore, upon hyaluronic acid treatment, coexpression of c-Crk-II and ERMs enhanced cell motility, whereas the sole expression of c-Crk-II or either of the ERMs decreased the motility of 3Y1 cells. These results suggest that Crk may be involved in regulation of cell motility by a hyaluronic acid-dependent mechanism through an association with ERMs. Cell migration is a well organized process regulated by the extracellular matrix-mediated cytoskeletal reorganization.

Extracellullar matrix drives the spatiotemporal reorganization of the cytoskeleton, which is involved in physiological cell migration, tumor cell invasion, and metastasis. Multiple cell surface molecules have been shown to participate in this extracellullar matrix-dependent signaling mechanism. One of the major molecules is CD44, a transmembrane receptor for hyaluronic acid (4Ponta H. Sherman L. Herrlich P.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

The cleavage of CD44 at the extracellular domain by membrane-associated metalloproteinases plays a crucial role in efficient cell detachment during cell migration (6Tsukita S. Oishi K. Sato N.

Chem. 1999; 274: 25525-25534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The binding of CD44 and ERMs is controlled by the threonine phosphorylation of ERMs through Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) and also by N-terminal phospholipid modification of ERMs (8Matsui T. Maeda M. Doi Y. Yonemura S. Amano M. Kaibuchi K. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 647-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). The signaling adaptor protein Crk, which is composed of an SH2 domain and two SH3 domains, is considered to be involved in cytoskeletal regulation. Crk has been shown to interact with components of focal adhesion, such as p130Cas and paxillin (9Brugge J.S. Nat. Gen. 1998; 19: 309-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 10Feller S.M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6348-6371Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar), which were tyrosine-phosphorylated mainly by integrin stimulation. Crk transmits signals to downstream effecters through Crk-SH3 binding proteins C3G and Dock180, which exert a guanine-nucleotide exchange factor activity on Rap-1/R-Ras and Rac, respectively (11Tanaka S. Morishita T. Hashimoto Y. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Shibuya M. Matuoka K. Takenawa T. Kurata T. Nagashima K. Matsuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In fact, studies of C3G knockout mice have suggested the regulation of cell adhesion by C3G through Rap-1 (14Ohba Y. Ikuta K. Ogura A. Matsuda J. Mochizuki N. Nagashima K. Kurokawa K. Mayer B.J.

The phagocytosis, membrane ruffling, and lamellipodia formation has been shown to be regulated by a Dock180-ELMO-Rac-dependent mechanism (15Brugnera E. Haney L. Grimsley C. Lu M. Walk S.F.

Cell. 2001; 107: 27-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Besides the identification of the activation of Rap-1 or Rac, we and others previously found that Crk could activate another GTPase, RhoA, in rat fibroblast 3Y1 cells or PC-12 neuronal cells (17Iwahara T. Akagi T. Shishido T. Hanafusa H. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 5946-5957Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 18Altun-Gultekin Z.F. Chandriani S. Bougeret C. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. de Graaf P.

Cell Growth Differ. 2002; 13: 131-139PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of Crk-induced RhoA activation and its role were still under the investigation. In this study, we analyzed the mechanism and significance of the Crk-induced RhoA activation and found the novel association of Crk and ERMs. Unlike the known Crk-associated molecules, these bindings were not dependent solely on the SH2 or SH3 domain. In agreement with the activation of RhoA by Crk, Rho-GDI was colocalized and coprecipitated with Crk. Thus, the dissociation of Rho-GDI and RhoA by Crk was supposed to be involved in RhoA activation. Furthermore, Crk and the phosphorylated form of ERMs cooperatively induced microvilli formation in fibroblasts. The hyaluronic acid treatment enhanced the activation of RhoA in cell lines stably expressing Crk and ERMs. Finally, Crk and ERMs cooperatively regulated cell motility toward hyaluronic acid. These results suggest that Crk associated with ERMs and activated RhoA, possibly through Rho-GDI. Through this mechanism, Crk plays a role in hyaluronic acid-induced enhancement of cell motility.

The cDNAs of ezrin, radixin, and moesin, a gift from Dr. Sachiko Tsukita (Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan), were subcloned into the pCXN2-Flag vector. The cDNA for Rho-GDI was a gift from Dr. Yoshimi Takai (Osaka University, Osaka, Japan). The following are Crk mutants: pCAGGS-Myc-CrkII-R38V (an SH2 mutant of c-Crk-II), pCAGGS-Myc-CrkII-W169L (an SH3 mutant of of c-Crk-II), pCAGGS-Myc-vCrk-N273 (an SH2 mutant of v-Crk), and pCAGGS-Myc-vCrk-W405K (an SH3 mutant of v-Crk). Establishment of Cell Lines—To establish stable cell lines expressing Crk and/or ERMs, mammalian expression plasmids of pCAGGS-Myc-Crk II and/or pCXN2-Flag-ezrin, -radixin, or -moesin were transfected to 3Y1 cells using Fugene 6 transfection reagent (Roche). After the selection with 400 μg/ml of G418 (Calbiochem), the expression levels of Crk and ERMs were examined by immunoblotting using anti-Myc and anti-Flag antibody, respectively. Immunoprecipitaion and Immunoblotting—Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed by the method described elsewhere. For detection of CD44 by immunoblotting, cells were pretreated by proteasome inhibitor as described previously (19Tsuda M. Tanaka S. Sawa H. Hanafusa H. Nagashima K. Cell Growth Differ. 2002; 13: 131-139PubMed Google Scholar). Confocal Laser Scanning—For analysis of the subcellular localization of v-Crk, cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature (RT), permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 4 min at RT, and then refixed with 70% methanol for 5 min at –20 °C. Anti-gag monoclonal antibody, 3C2 (1:50 dilution), and Alexa 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin antibody (1:200 dilution; Molecular Probes) were used as primary and secondary antibodies, respectively. For analysis of the localization of pERMs, cells were fixed with 10% trichloroacetic acid for 15 min on ice. Anti-pERM Ab (297S, culture supernatant without dilution) and Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rat immunoglobulin antibody (1:200 dilution; Molecular Probes) were used as primary and secondary antibodies, respectively. The samples were observed using a confocal laser-scanning microscope (FV-300; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a computer. Pull-down Assay for RhoA and Rac—These methods were described previously (19Tsuda M. Tanaka S. Sawa H. Hanafusa H. Nagashima K. Cell Growth Differ. 2002; 13: 131-139PubMed Google Scholar, 20Nishihara H. Maeda M. Tsuda M. Makino Y. Sawa H. Nagashima K. Tanaka S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 296: 716-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In brief, for Rho assay, serum-starved v-Crk-inducible 3Y1 cells with or without Dox were lysed by lysis buffer composed of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin. Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 5,000 × g, 4 °C, for 5 min, and the supernatants were incubated with 10 μg of GST-rhotekin-RBD fusion protein pre-conjugated with glutathione-beads at 4 °C for 1 h. For Rac assay, cells were lysed with lysis buffer composed of 1% Nonidet P-40, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysates were clarified by 12,000 rpm at 4 °C for 1 min, and the supernatant was incubated with 10 μg of purified GST-PAK2-RBD and glutathione beads at 4 °C for 1 h. In both Rho and Rac assays, the beads were washed three times with each lysis buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE with a 12% gel. Precipitated RhoA or Rac1 was detected by immunoblotting using anti-RhoA or Rac1Ab. Immunoelectron Microscopy—Analysis was performed by the pre-embedding method with double immunostaining. v-Crk-induced 3Y1 cells were fixed with 0.1% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer for 5 min on ice and first incubated with a mixture of primary rat monoclonal antibodies for pERM and a mouse mAb for v-Crk for 3 days at 4 °C. After washing with PBS, the specimens were incubated with 10 nm gold-labeled anti-mouse immunoglobulin Ab for 1 h, followed by incubation for 1 h with biotin-labeled anti-rat Ab, which was further reacted with peroxidase-labeled streptavidin. After re-fixation for 5 min, the enzyme reaction was visualized by using diaminobenzidine as substrate. Cells were re-fixed with 2% OsO4 in 0.1 m phosphate buffer for 50 min and then embedded in Epon. Cells in Epon block were sectioned into 1-μm thicknesses and stained with 1% toluidin blue for confirmation of the status of the cells. Then, ultra-thin sections made with the use of an ultramicrotome (Ultracut, Reihert-Jung, Co, Ansberg, Germany) were stained with 0.2% lead citrate for 5 min. Samples were observed by transmission electron microscopy (Hitachi 7100, Tokyo, Japan). Wound Healing Assay—The method for the wound healing assay was described previously (19Tsuda M. Tanaka S. Sawa H. Hanafusa H. Nagashima K. Cell Growth Differ. 2002; 13: 131-139PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, after the initial plating of cells for 48 h on uncoated, 10 μg/ml fibronectin- or hyaluronic acid-coated culture dishes, cells were scraped off/wounded by a yellow tip. Subsequently, at 12 and 18 h, the recovery percentage of the wounded portion was measured. Association of Crk and ERMs—To examine the mechanism of Crk-mediated cytoskeletal movement, the association of Crk and ERMs was examined, because we reported the Crk-dependent activation of RhoA and the cleavage of CD44 (19Tsuda M. Tanaka S. Sawa H. Hanafusa H. Nagashima K. Cell Growth Differ. 2002; 13: 131-139PubMed Google Scholar), and ERMs are known to bind to CD44 regulating actin cytoskeleton. First, we found that anti-Crk antibody coprecipitated transiently expressed ERMs with endogenous Crk in human embryonic kidney 293T cells (Fig. 1A, lanes 1–3). Furthermore, with the overexpression of either v-Crk or human c-Crk-II and ERMs, the association of Crk and ERMs was efficiently demonstrated in 293T cells (Fig. 1A, lanes 4–9). To confirm the association of Crk and ERMs, we established 3Y1 cell lines stably expressing either c-Crk-II or ERMs alone, and c-Crk-II and either of the ERMs. In these cell lines, coprecipitations of EMRs with Crk were clearly demonstrated (Fig. 1B, lanes 6–8). To analyze the binding mechanism of Crk and ERMs, we transiently transfected mutants of c-Crk-II with ERMs in 293T cells. Although the association of c-Crk-II and radixin/moesin seemed to be weakened when we expressed the SH2 or SH3 mutants of c-Crk-II (Fig. 1C, lanes 9, 10, 12, and 13), we could not detect a remarkable suppression of the binding of SH2- or SH3-mutants of c-Crk-II and ERMs (Fig. 1C). Mutational analyses using SH2 or SH3 mutants of v-Crk and CrkL were also performed, and similar results were obtained (data not shown). Activation of Rho by Crk and ERMs—To examine the effect of the association of Crk and ERMs on Crk-induced activation of RhoA, we performed a pull-down assay using the GST fusion form of Rhotekin-RBD in 293T cells. The activities of RhoA were augmented by coexpression of ERMs by 2.8-fold compared with Crk alone (Fig. 2A, top and graph). In addition, coexpression of Crk and EMRs enhanced Rac activity (Fig. 2B, bottom and graph). To examine the mechanism of Crk-induced Rho activation, we focused on the association of Crk and Rho-GDI, because no known Rho guanine-nucleotide exchange factor has been reported to bind to Crk. In fact, Rho-GDI contains possible Crk-interacting sequences, such as the YXXP motif for the SH2 domain and proline-rich region for the SH3 domain. The colocalization of these proteins was observed in 3Y1 cells by confocal microscopy (Fig. 2B), and force-expressed Crk was coprecipitated with Rho-GDI by using anti-Rho-GDI antibody in 293T cells (Fig. 2C, arrowhead). The association of ERMs and Rho-GDI was also observed, as reported previously (Fig. 2C, asterisk) (21Takahashi K. Sasaki T. Mammoto A. Takaishi K. Kameyama T. Tsukita S. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23371-23375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). It should be noted that we failed to detect the association of endogenous Crk and Rho-GDI (data not shown). Association of Crk and pERMs and Induction of Microvilli Formation—Because ERM proteins were known to be regulated by phosphorylation, the binding of Crk and the phosphorylated form of ERMs (pERMs) were examined by using a v-Crk-inducible 3Y1 cell line (clone 21-2-1) (19Tsuda M. Tanaka S. Sawa H. Hanafusa H. Nagashima K. Cell Growth Differ. 2002; 13: 131-139PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of v-Crk, the association of Crk with pERMs was detectable in the cytoplasmic fraction of 3Y1 cells (Fig. 3A). We then analyzed the subcellular localization of pERMs in a v-Crk-inducible 3Y1 cell line. pERMs were observed diffusely in the cytoplasm and partially at the edge of the cytoplasm of 3Y1 cells without v-Crk (Fig. 3B, a). However, with v-Crk induction, pERMs were demonstrated to translocate to cellular microvilli, and co-localization of v-Crk and pERMs was shown by a merged image (Fig. 3B, b–d). In addition, co-localization of v-Crk and pERMs was also detected as dotted patterns in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3B, b–d, arrowheads). To confirm the involvement of ROCK, which was known to phosphorylate ERMs in v-Crk-dependent microvilli formation of pERMs, we used the ROCK inhibitor Y27632 and found that this reagent inhibited the localization of pERMs to microvilli, whereas the remaining co-localization of v-Crk and pERMs was still detectable in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3B, e–g, arrowheads). With Y27632 treatment, phosphothreonine levels of ERMs especially on ezrin and radixin were decreased, but the detectable levels of the phosphorylated form of moesin should be noted (Fig. 3C, lanes 3 and 4). Given that the accumulation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate in the plasma membrane through the activation of Rho/ROCK/PI 4-phospho 5-kinase cascade has been shown to be involved in the continuous activation of pERMs (22Matsui T. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1259-1262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we analyzed the effect of neomycin that inhibits the membrane accumulation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and found that this reagent produced similar responses to Y27632 (Fig. 3, B, h–j and C, lanes 5 and 6). To confirm the immunofluorescence study, we performed immunoelectron microscopy using the double staining method. pERMs were visualized with the use of diaminobenzidine, in which they are recognized as electron-dense black substances by transmission electron microscopy, and the presence of anti-v-Crk Ab was demonstrated by secondary antibodies labeled with 10-nm gold particles. pERM labeled with diaminobenzidine was recognized in the cytoplasm of vCrk-expressing 3Y1 cells by light microscopy (Fig. 4a). Immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated that vCrk was colocalized with pERM at the microvilli, cytoplasmic edge, and filamentous structure in the cytoplasm of the cells (Fig. 4, b–g). The Cleavage of CD44 in 3Y1 Cells Expressing Both Crk and ERMs—To analyze the involvement of Crk in the hyaluronic acid-CD44-dependent signaling mechanism, we examined whether Crk increased the cleavage of CD44. Without hyaluronic acid, there was no detectable level of cleavage product of CD44 in Crk or Crk/ERMs-expressing cells (Fig. 5A, top, lanes 3, 7, and 8). Upon hyaluronic acid coating, the cleavage products of CD44 could be observed in Crk-expressing cells and coexpressing cells of c-Crk-II and ezrin or radixin (Fig. 5A, bottom, lanes 3, 7, and 8). Cleaved bands were not observed in Crk/moesin-coexpressing cells (Fig. 5A, bottom, lane 9). Analysis of Cell Motility of 3Y1 Cells Expressing Crk and ERMs—To examine whether the association of Crk with ERMs affects cell motility, we performed wound healing assay by using 3Y1 cells stably expressing Crk and ERMs. Without extracellular matrix, the expression of Crk decreased cell motility, as reported previously (19Tsuda M. Tanaka S. Sawa H. Hanafusa H. Nagashima K. Cell Growth Differ. 2002; 13: 131-139PubMed Google Scholar), and expression of either of the ERMs also suppressed motilities (Fig. 5B, top). Coexpression of Crk and either of the ERMs slightly promoted motility, but the levels were still below those observed with wild-type 3Y1 cells. However, upon hyaluronic acid stimulation, double expression of Crk and ERMs enhanced motility more than wild-type level (Fig. 5B, bottom). With integrin stimulation, Crk-expressing cells and the double expression of Crk and ERMs recovered the motility to the levels of wild-type 3Y1 cells but did not provide significant enhancement of motility higher than that of wild-type 3Y1 cells (data not shown). To confirm the involvement of the CD44 cleavage in v-Crk-regulated cell motility, we examined the effect of PI-3 kinase inhibitors because PI-3 kinase was known to up-regulate CD44 cleavage (23Kawano Y. Okamoto I. Murakami D. Itoh H. Yoshida M. Ueda S. Saya H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29628-29635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 24Kamikura D.M. Khoury H. Maroun C. Naujokas M.A. Park M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3482-3496Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Wound healing assay demonstrated that PI-3 kinase inhibitors such as LY294002 and Wortmannin tend to suppress the motility of 3Y1 cell lines; however, this suppressive function was most prominently found in 3Y1 cells stably expressing Crk and ezrin (Fig. 5C). PI-3 kinase inhibitors did not affect the motility of cells expressing Crk and moesin (Fig. 5C). Signaling adaptor protein Crk was originally found as an avian sarcoma encoding oncoprotein v-Crk (25Mayer B.J. Hamaguchi M. Hanafusa H. Nature. 1988; 332: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Since human c-Crk-II, the homologue of v-Crk, was isolated, the identification of Crk targets has suggested that Crk links between tyrosine phosphorylated proteins and guanine-nucleotide exchange factors for small GTPases, and regulates cytoskeletal reorganization. In particular, under fibronectin stimulation, the integrin-provoked signal has been shown to be mediated by Crk and transmitted to the downstream effecter Dock180, leading to Rac activation. However, the mechanism of Crk-mediated cell migration or tumor cell invasion has remained under investigation. In this study, we have found a novel interaction of Crk and the ERM family of proteins that is involved in activation of Rho and hyaluronic acid-CD44 dependent regulation of cell motility (Fig. 6). In contrast to the known Crk binding molecules such as p130Cas, paxillin, C3G, and Dock180, the interaction of Crk and EMRs were not solely SH2- or SH3-dependent. Mutation analysis showed that both SH2 and SH3 mutants of Crk significantly attenuate the association of Crk and ERMs, whereas Crk SH2 mutant binds to ezrin as much as wild-type Crk. Thus, Crk may bind to EMRs by both the SH2 and SH3 domains. On the other hand, the entire conformation of Crk might be required for this association. Determination of the Crk binding site(s) of ERMs may reveal the mechanism. According to our previous results, v-Crk activated RhoA in fibroblasts and coexpression of Crk, and ERMs enhanced the activity of RhoA in 293T cells. Given that no known Rho-guanine-nucleotide exchange factor was found to bind to Crk, the mechanism of Crk-dependent activation of Rho was the missing link. Rho-GDI has been shown to bind to the N-terminal FERM domain of ERMs (21Takahashi K. Sasaki T. Mammoto A. Takaishi K. Kameyama T. Tsukita S. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23371-23375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), and these data led us to hypothesize that upon extracellullar matrix stimulation, Crk binds to the negative regulator of RhoA (such as Rho-GDI), inactivates Rho-GDI, and leads to the activation of RhoA shown as Fig. 6. Thus, we examined the association of Rho-GDI and Crk. In this study, the association of force-expressed Crk and Rho-GDI was observed in 293T cells, but we failed to show the association of endogenous Crk and Rho-GDI (data not shown). In 293T cells, we did not examine the inhibition of the function of negative regulator Rho-GDI because the simple expression of Rho-GDI did not significantly suppress the activity of RhoA measured by pull-down assay. Furthermore, we also tried to test the effect of Crk on another negative regulator of RhoA, Rho-GAP. However, we did not observe a significant activation of RhoA by the double expression of Crk and Rho-GAP (data not shown). Establishment of a deficient cell line for the negative regulator of RhoA may reveal the Crk-dependent activation mechanism of Rho in future studies. Because it is known that ERMs were phosphorylated in the cytoplasm and translocated to membrane, and that pERMs link between CD44 and actin cytoskeleton, we analyzed the localization of pERMs in v-Crk-inducible fibroblasts. In 3Y1 cells, v-Crk translocated pERMs and induced microvilli formation by a ROCK-dependent signaling mechanism. Although we expected the induction of v-Crk-induced phophorylation of ERMs, we failed to demonstrate such increased phosphorylation of ERMs by Crk in our system (Fig. 3C). We speculate that the relatively high levels of pERMs in the cytoplasm of wild-type 3Y1 cells may mask further phosphorylation of ERMs. In this study, we showed that the association of Crk and ERMs was involved in the hyaluronic acid-CD44 signaling mechanism to promote cell motility. Considering the mechanism of Crk-dependent enhancement of CD44 cleavage, Crk may also regulate the transcriptional levels of matrix metalloproteinases. As Crk is also known to activate PI-3 kinase (26Akagi T. Shishido T. Murata K. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7290-7295Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), which was reported to control the transcriptional levels of matrix metalloproteinases by a Rac-Cdc25-dependent mechanism (23Kawano Y. Okamoto I. Murakami D. Itoh H. Yoshida M. Ueda S. Saya H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29628-29635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 24Kamikura D.M. Khoury H. Maroun C. Naujokas M.A. Park M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3482-3496Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of PI-3 kinase inhibitors on Crk/ERM-dependent motility of 3Y1 cells on an HA-coated plate. The data shown in Fig. 5C suggest that PI-3 kinase may be involved in the motility of Crk/ezrin- and Crk/radixin-expressing 3Y1 cells. In addition, the Ras/ERK pathway may be involved in Crk-dependent expression of matrix metalloproteinases, because v-Crk has been reported to activate the secretion of matrix metalloproteinase through Ras and ERK (27Liu E. Thant A.A. Kikkawa F. Kurata H. Tanaka S. Nawa A. Mizutani S. Matsuda S. Hanafusa H. Hamaguchi M. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2361-2364PubMed Google Scholar). We and others have reported recently that overexpression of Crk, especially Crk-I, was observed in human malignant tumors, such as glioblastoma and lung cancer (28Miller C.T. Chen G. Gharib T.G. Wang H. Thomas D.G. Misek D.E. Giordano T.J. Yee J. Orringer M.B. Hanash S.M. Beer D.G. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 7950-7957Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 29Nishihara H. Tanaka S. Tsuda M.

Yamada K.M. Sato H. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2335-2337PubMed Google Scholar). Crk has been shown to be related to the malignant feature of tumor cells. Thus, we should reveal the significance of our present findings, in which Crk regulates cell motility through hyarulonic acid/CD44/ERM, in relation to the invasiveness of human cancers in future studies.

For the first time, the presteady-state kinetic analysis of the Phe-sensitive DAHP synthase from E. coli is reported. The steady-state and presteady-state kinetic parameters of the DAHP synthase reconstituted with Mn(II), Cu(II), and Zn(II) were compared. These studies showed the following: 1) product release is rate-limiting for all of the three metal ions studied under physiologically relevant conditions; 2) concentration of the active sites of the metal-containing DAHP synthase is increasing from Mn- (30%) to Zn- (52%) and to Cu-DAHP synthase (88%); 3) rate constant for product formation is higher in Mn- (130–200 s–1) than Cu- (55 s–1) and Zn-DAHP synthase (6.8 s–1); and 4) steady-state rate (rate constant for product release) is higher for the Mn- (70 s–1) than for Cu- (5.6 s–1) and Zn-DAHP synthase (1.8 s–1). In addition, an examination of the reaction kinetics at lower pH reveals that for Cu-DAHP synthase, product release is no longer rate-limiting, whereas the Mn- and Zn-DAHP synthase show a slower rate of product formation, suggesting that the intermediate formation becomes rate-limiting in product formation. Also, a deuterium-isotope effect on the burst rate constant of product formation for Mn-DAHP synthase was observed at pH 6.0.

The first committed step in the biosynthesis of shikimic acid, which ultimately leads to the synthesis of aromatic amino acids, is catalyzed by 3-deoxy-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate (DAHP) 1The abbreviations used are: DAHP, 3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; E4P, erythrose-4-phosphate; bis-tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)-propane-1,3-diol; BTP, bis-tris propane, TEAB, triethylammonium bicarbonate; KDO8P synthase, 3-deoxy-d-manno-2-octulosonic acid-8-phosphate synthase. synthase. The biosynthetic pathway of aromatic amino acids is absent in mammals, rendering the enzyme an attractive molecular target for antibiotic design. A putative inhibitor for the enzyme would inhibit bacterial growth while leaving the host organism unaffected. Over the years, DAHP synthase has been isolated from a wide range of organisms ranging from bacteria to eukaryotes (1Gorlach J. Schmid J. Amrhein N.

Escherichia coli harbors three DAHP synthase isozymes, each subject to feedback inhibition by one of the three aromatic amino acids (tyrosine, phenylalanine, and tryptophan, respectively). In the present study, we have focused on the phenylalanine-sensitive DAHP synthase encoded by E. coli aroG gene. The enzyme catalyzes the net aldol condensation of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and erythrose 4-phosphate (E4P) to form DAHP and inorganic phosphate (Pi) (Scheme 1). The degree of sequence homology between the E. coli DAHP synthase and the 3-deoxy-d-manno-2-octulosonic acid-8-phosphate (KDO8P synthase) and the conserved active site residues between the two enzymes allow us to extrapolate the mechanistic findings from one system to the other (6Radaev S.

Also, experiments using radiolabeled H 182O established that the reaction involves the nucleophilic attack of a water molecule on C-2 of PEP, followed by or in concert with the nucleophilic attack of C-3 of PEP on the C-1 of arabinose 5-phosphate. A similar mechanism can be envisioned for the E. coli DAHP synthase. Indeed, the most recent crystal structure (10Shumilin I.A. Bauerle R. Kretsinger R.H. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3766-3776Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) revealed the presence of seven water molecules in the active site of the enzyme, with two of them positioned in close proximity to the C-2 of PEP that may serve as the nucleophile in the reaction (Scheme 1). Unlike KDO8P synthase, which can catalyze this reaction either in a metal-dependent or metal-independent fashion, the DAHP synthases isolated thus far are all metal-dependent. From the first time DAHP synthase was isolated from E. coli in 1969 (2Staub M. Denes G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 178: 599-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), there has been an ongoing controversy in the literature regarding the nature of the metal ion at the active site of this enzyme. A variety of metal ions have been proposed to reside at the active site of DAHP synthase under physiological conditions. They include cobalt (2Staub M. Denes G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 178: 599-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 11Ganson R.J. Jensen R.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 260: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), iron (4Paravicini G.

Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 1894-1901Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or copper (13Baasov T. Knowles J.R. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 6155-6160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Today, after more than 30 years of research, the nature of the physiological metal ion at the active site of DAHP synthase remains an open question. A major objective of this work is to decipher the role of metal ion at the active site of DAHP synthase and to gain insights into the mechanism of product formation by determining the steady-state and presteady-state kinetic parameters of the enzyme reconstituted with different metal ions. Potential metal coordinating residues, Cys-61 and His-268, have been shown to play an important role in the catalytic activity of DAHP synthase (14Howe D.L. Duewel H.S. Woodard R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40258-40265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 15Sundaram A.K. Howe D.L. Sheflyan G.Y. Woodard R.W. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Mn(II) (hard metal) and Cu(II) or Zn(II) (softer metals as compared with Mn(II)) coordinate different types of ligands, with Mn(II) preferring oxygen ligands and Cu(II) or Zn(II) preferring nitrogen and thiol ligands (16Christianson D.W. Cox J.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 33-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Accordingly, a detailed kinetic analysis of the enzyme reconstituted with Mn(II), Cu(II), and Zn(II) has been performed. The parameters derived from steady-state and presteady-state burst experiments for the Mn-, Cu-, and Zn-DAHP synthase were compared to address the following questions. (i) What is the rate-limiting step in the kinetic mechanism of Mn-, Cu-, and Zn-DAHP synthase? (ii) What is the concentration of the active sites for the three forms of DAHP synthase? (iii) What are the relative rate constants of chemical catalysis for product formation? (iv) Which step in the catalytic mechanism is affected by lowering the pH? (v) What may the steady-state and presteady-state kinetic parameters reveal regarding the ability of the metal ion to facilitate the reaction? In addition, the deuterium kinetic isotope effect on the rate constant of product formation was determined to gain information on the steps leading to intermediate formation and intermediate decay. This report constitutes the first presteady-state kinetic analysis of a DAHP synthase and provides insight into these questions that may offer valuable input for the design of novel enzyme inhibitors. In this section and throughout the paper we used DAHP synthase to refer to the isolated “as is” DAHP synthase and apoDAHP synthase for the EDTA-treated DAHP synthase (metal-free). Materials—PEP, E4P, manganese chloride (MnCl2), copper chloride (CuCl2), magnesium chloride (MgCl2), ATP, potassium monophosphate (KH2PO4), ammonium chloride (NH4Cl), inorganic pyrophosphatase, triethylamine, and Chelex-100 were purchased from Sigma. [1-14C] Pyruvate was obtained from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, and the high pressure liquid chromatography MonoQ 5/5 anion-exchange column was from Amersham Biosciences. Purification of DAHP Synthase—DAHP synthase was purified as reported previously (17Sheflyan G. Howe D.L. Wilson T.L. Woodard R.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 11027-11032Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by using an extinction coefficient for DAHP synthase at 280 nm of 40.5 mm–1 cm–1 (18Park O.K. Bauerle R. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1636-1642Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of the active sites was determined as described below, and the catalytic rate was calculated based on concentration of the active sites determined from burst experiments. [1-14C]PEP Synthesis—Radiolabeled PEP was enzymatically synthesized from [1-14C]pyruvate by coupling the pyruvate phosphate dikinase reaction to inorganic pyrophosphatase reaction. Pyruvate phosphate dikinase was a generous gift from Prof. Dunaway-Mariano at the University of New Mexico. The radiolabeled PEP was purified by Q-Sepharose anion-exchange chromatography using a linear gradient of 20 mm to 1 m triethylamine bicarbonate (TEAB). The fractions containing PEP were identified by absorbance at 232 nm. Final stock solutions (5.6 mm) contained 29,300 dpm/nmol. Metal Ion Removal from DAHP Synthase and Reconstitution with Mn(II), Cu(II), or Zn(II) Metal Ions—In order to eliminate heterogeneity in metal ion composition in the enzyme, prior to all kinetic experiments, the enzyme was treated with EDTA to remove the metal ions bound to the isolated enzyme. The enzyme was dialyzed overnight against 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, containing 10 mm EDTA followed by successive dialysis (two times for 4 h) against the same buffer but in the absence of EDTA. All buffers were treated with Chelex-100. The glassware and the spectrophotometric cuvettes were washed with 2 m KOH. After dialysis, the enzyme was concentrated using a Centriprep YM-10 (Millipore), diluted to the desired concentration prior to the rapid chemical quench experiment and reconstituted with 2 mm MnCl2 or 2 mm CuCl2. For the reconstitution with ZnCl2, the enzyme was first diluted to 100 nm. An equimolar concentration of ZnCl2 was then added, and the reconstituted enzyme was concentrated to the desired concentration. Steady-state Kinetic Analysis; Mn(II), Cu(II), and Zn(II) Dependence of the Steady-state Rate—The reactions were performed at 25 °C in 1 ml of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5. The reactants were added in the following order: the metal ions (0–500 μm) and the apoDAHP synthase (50 nm) were preincubated for 10 min, then 300 μm PEP was added to the reaction mixture, and the reaction was initiated by the addition of the second substrate, E4P. The consumption of PEP was monitored spectrophotometrically by following the decrease of absorbance at 232 nm. The steady-state rate was calculated by using an extinction coefficient for PEP at 232 nm of 2.84 mm–1 cm–1. The effect on the rate by metal ions was determined by comparing the rates with CuCl2, ZnCl2, and MnCl2. There was no change in the kinetic behavior such as a lag in the reaction kinetics when the order of addition of reactants was changed. To test the optimum amount of metal ion required to fully activate the enzyme, apoDAHP synthase (50-μl aliquots of 54 μm) was incubated with different MnCl2 concentrations in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5. After 10 min of incubation, 1 μl was removed and added to a 1-ml reaction mixture containing 1 mm E4P, 300 μm PEP in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5. No additional metal ion was added to the reaction mixture. The consumption of PEP was monitored spectrophotometrically by following the decrease of absorbance at 232 nm. The steady-state rate was calculated by using an extinction coefficient for PEP at 232 nm of 2.84 mm–1 cm–1. The steady-state rate was plotted against the metal ion/DAHP synthase ratio. Presteady-state Kinetic Analysis—The enzyme and substrate concentrations described below and throughout the paper represent the concentrations after mixing. Burst experiments were performed using [1-14C]PEP. The reaction was quenched with 0.3 m KOH using a Kintek RQF-3 Chemical Quench apparatus (Kintek Instruments, Austin, TX). The samples were analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography with on-line UV-visible detector (Waters 486 Tunable Absorbance Detector) and flow scintillation analyzer for radioactivity detection (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The analysis system was automated using a Waters 717plus (Milford, MA) autosampler. The substrates and products were separated on an anion-exchange MonoQ HR 5/5 column (Amersham Biosciences) using a 35-min linear gradient from 20 mm to 1 m TEAB. The elution was performed with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Before entering the radioactivity detector, the eluent was mixed with liquid scintillation mixture (Monoflow V, National Diagnostics) at a flow rate of 5 ml/min. Under these conditions, the retention times for DAHP and PEP were 15 and 17 min, respectively. Presteady-state burst experiments were performed under several different experimental conditions as described below. Burst Experiment for the Mn-DAHP Synthase—ApoDAHP synthase (8.4 μm), 2 mm MnCl2, and 25.2 μm [1-14C]PEP were reacted with 500 μm E4P. To examine the effect of pH, the burst experiments were conducted in 50 mm BTP, pH 7.6 and pH 6.0. The reaction was quenched with 0.3 m KOH. A similar experiment was performed at pH 6.0 in protonated and deuterated BTP. In these experiments, apoDAHP synthase (20 μm), 2mm MnCl2, and 60 μm [1-14C]PEP were reacted with 500 μm E4P. Burst Experiment for the Zn-DAHP Synthase—ApoDAHP synthase (5 μm), 5 μm ZnCl2, and 15 μm [1-14C]PEP were reacted with 500 μm E4P in 50 mm BTP, pH 7.6 and pH 6.0. To follow the dependence of presteady-state burst experiments on DAHP synthase concentration, burst experiments were performed at three different enzyme concentrations: 3, 5, and 7.5 μm. The enzyme incubated with a 3-fold excess of [1-14C]PEP (9, 15, and 22.5 μm, respectively) and an equimolar concentration of ZnCl2 was reacted with 500 μm E4P. The reaction was quenched with 0.3 m KOH. Burst Experiment for the Cu-DAHP Synthase—ApoDAHP synthase (12.5 μm), 2mm CuCl2, and 37 μm [1-14C]PEP were reacted with 500 μm E4P. The reaction was performed in 50 mm BTP, pH 7.5, and the reaction was quenched with 0.3 m KOH. To examine the effect of pH, a burst experiment for the Cu-DAHP synthase was conducted at pH 6.5. For this experiment, 10 μm apoDAHP synthase, 2 mm CuCl2, and 30 μm [1-14C]PEP were reacted with 500 μm E4P in 50 mm BTP, pH 6.5, followed by quenching with 0.3 m KOH at the desired time interval. Data Analysis. Steady-state Experiments—Data were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation, and the kcat and Km parameters for copper and manganese were determined. Presteady-state Burst Experiments—DAHP formation (μm) was plotted against time (s), and data were fit to a burst equation (Equation 1).C=C0⋅(1−e(−k1⋅t))+C0⋅k2⋅t(Eq. 1) C represents DAHP concentration at time t; the amplitude C0 corresponds to the concentration of the active sites; k1 is the rate constant for DAHP formation (s–1); and k2 is the rate of DAHP release (s–1). The percentage of active enzyme can be calculated by dividing C0 with the enzyme concentration. Data were analyzed using Kaleidagraph version 3.52, released June 17, 2002 by Synergy Software. When isolated from E. coli, recombinant DAHP synthase is heterogeneous in terms of metal ion content with 30% of DAHP synthase containing Fe(II) and 10% containing Zn(II), Cu(II), and other metal ions, whereas most of the enzyme (>60%) does not seem to have any metal ion bound at the active site. Reconstitution of apoDAHP synthase with different metal ions showed that a wide range of metal ions activate the enzyme. Although the highest catalytic rate is achieved with Mn(II), Zn(II) is the metal ion with the highest affinity for DAHP synthase (19Stephens C.M. Bauerle R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20810-20817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Considering the different chemical properties of the two metal ions (16Christianson D.W. Cox J.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 33-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), one of the objectives was to investigate how these differences are reflected on the kinetic landscape of the reaction catalyzed by Mn-DAHP synthase versus Zn-DAHP synthase. The chemical properties of Cu(II) (type of ligands and coordination geometry) are similar to those of Zn(II), but the magnetic (EPR-active) and optical properties of Cu(II) could be further exploited in the kinetic analysis of DAHP synthase. Therefore, the presteady-state kinetics of Cu-DAHP synthase was also studied. In the first part of the “Results” section, the steady-state and presteady-state kinetics of the Mn-, Cu-, and Zn-DAHP synthase are presented, whereas the second part focuses on the pH dependence and deuterium kinetic isotope effect of the presteady-state kinetic parameters of Mn-, Cu-, and Zn-DAHP synthase. The main goals of these experiments are as follows: 1) determine the correlation between metal ion affinity and the concentration of the active sites, 2) determine the rate-limiting step in the catalytic cycle, and 3) gain insight into the steps that lead to product formation. The main hypothesis for this work was that a comparison of the presteady-state kinetic parameters for Mn-, Cu-, and Zn-DAHP synthase at different pH values along with the investigation of the deuterium isotope effect on the kinetics of product formation would provide insight into the role of metal ion at the active site of DAHP synthase. The Dependence of kcat on MnCl2 Concentration—Manganese has been reported as the metal ion that gives the highest steady-state rate (19Stephens C.M. Bauerle R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20810-20817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, the Kd (1 μm) and kcat (23 s–1) values were determined by following the consumption of PEP in a continuous spectrophotometric assay (Fig. 1). The kcat value was calculated based on protein concentration by assuming a concentration of the active sites equal to protein concentration. However, the results of burst experiments with the Mn-DAHP synthase (see below and Fig. 2) show that only 30% of the enzyme is active. Therefore, the corrected kcat value based upon the concentration of the active sites is 75 s–1 (Fig. 1). This value is in accordance with the previously reported rate determined for the enzyme (19Stephens C.M. Bauerle R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20810-20817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Fig. 2Burst experiments for Mn-DAHP synthase. 8.4 μm apo-DAHP synthase, 2 mm MnCl2, and 25.2 μm [1-14C]PEP were reacted with 500 μm E4P. The reaction was performed in 50 mm BTP pH 7.6 (•) and 50 mm BTP pH 6.0 (○). The parameters determined by fitting the data to a burst equation were 28% active sites, rate constant for product formation of 200 and 45 s–1, and steady-state rate of 36 and 24 s–1, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Determining the Concentration of the Active Sites for the Mn-DAHP Synthase—A burst experiment was performed to determine the concentration of the active sites. The data presented in Fig. 2 (solid circle) were fitted to Equation 1, and the resulting parameters are as follows: a burst rate of 200 s–1, amplitude corresponding to 28% of the protein concentration, and steady-state rate of 36 s–1 (Table I). There is a variance between the kcat determined in the steady-state assay (75 s–1) and the kcat determined in the presteady-state assay (36 s–1). A comparison of the steady-state and presteady-state experiments for Mn-DAHP synthase (KdMn 1 μm) and Cu-DAHP synthase (KdCu 120 nm, see below) reveals that whereas 2 mm Mn(II) is inhibitory for the steady-state rate, 2 mm Cu(II) is not, despite the almost 10-fold lower Kd of Cu(II). Therefore, in the case of Mn-DAHP synthase, we considered it necessary to look at the effect of the metal ion to enzyme ratio on the steady-state rate to explain the apparent discrepancy between the steady-state rate obtained from the presteady-state burst experiment and the rate obtained from the steady-state experiments. Most surprisingly, it was found that only in a relatively narrow range of Mn(II)/DAHP synthase concentration ratios (80–100) did the enzyme achieve maximum specific activity. Higher Mn(II) concentrations resulted in a rapid drop in the enzyme-specific activity. This is consistent with the presteady-state burst experiment in which a ratio of Mn(II)/DAHP synthase of 150 was used. The expected steady-state rate at this ratio of Mn(II)/DAHP synthase is 35 s–1, which is in good agreement with the steady-state rate determined from the burst experiment.Table ISummary of presteady-state kinetic parametersMn-DAHPSZn-DAHPSCu-DAHPSActive site concentrationBurst rateSteady-state rateActive site concentrationBurst rateSteady-state rateActive site concentrationBurst rateSteady-state rate%s-1s-1%s-1s-1%s-1s-1pH 6.0apH 6.5 for the Cu-DAHPS.284524527.41.72.3pH 7.62820036526.81.888555.6a pH 6.5 for the Cu-DAHPS. Open table in a new tab The Dependence of kcat on CuCl2 Concentration—The dependence of DAHP synthase rate upon CuCl2 concentration was determined. The kcat was 5 s–1 and the Kd for Cu(II) was 120 nm (Fig. 3). The values are based on protein concentration. Based on the results from the burst experiments described below, it was determined that 88% of the protein active sites were active adjusting the kcat to 5.6 s–1. Determining the Concentration of the Active Sites for the Cu-DAHP Synthase—To confirm the catalytic rate determined in the previous section and to gain information on the rate of product formation, a burst experiment for the Cu-DAHP synthase was performed. Similar to Mn-DAHP synthase, product release was also rate-limiting for Cu-DAHP synthase. The burst rate was 55 s–1; the amplitude corresponded to 88% of protein concentration; and the steady-state rate was 5.6 s–1 (Table I and Fig. 4, solid circles). The rates determined in the steady-state experiments were corrected by the concentration of the active sites, and the data were replotted (Fig. 3, open circles). Steady-state Rate Dependence on ZnCl2 Concentration—Apo-DAHP synthase was obtained following the same procedure described for the reconstitution with MnCl2 and CuCl2. The steady-state rate was the same over the range of metal ion concentrations used (3 s–1). Lowering the ZnCl2 concentration below the enzyme concentration resulted in a decrease in the steady-state rate most likely because of a lower metal ion to enzyme stoichiometry. Determining the Concentration of the Active Sites for the Zn-DAHP Synthase—ApoDAHP synthase reconstitution with equimolar concentrations of ZnCl2 (30 μm) resulted in inactive enzymes. Using the same protein in the steady-state assay (50 nm apoDAHP synthase and 50 nm ZnCl2) restored the activity to 3 s–1. Therefore, a different procedure was used for the reconstitution of apoDAHP synthase with ZnCl2. The metal-free enzyme was diluted to ∼100 nm and reconstituted with 100 nm ZnCl2, and after the activity was confirmed by steady-state assay, the enzyme was concentrated to 3–15 μm. The enzyme obtained in this way was used without further dilution for the burst experiments. Examples of the presteady-state burst experiments at three different enzyme concentrations are shown in Fig. 5. Although the steady-state rate and the concentration of the active sites were the same (2.3 s–1, 40%) for the three enzyme concentrations used (3 μm in Fig. 5, panel A, 5 μm in panel B, and 7.5 μm in panel C, final concentration), the burst rate varied from 22 s–1 to 8.7 and 4.84 s–1 as the enzyme concentration was increased. The Effect of pH on the Chemistry of DAHP Synthesis—To investigate the effect of pH on the rate of chemistry, presteady-state burst experiments were performed at lower pH values, and the experimental results for Mn-, Cu-, and Zn-DAHP synthase are summarized in Table I. Most surprisingly, the nature of metal ion seemed to have a major effect on the pH dependence of DAHP synthase. Zn-DAHP synthase was the least affected by the change in pH. The concentration of the active sites (52%), the burst rate (6.8–7.4 s–1), and the steady-state rate (1.7–1.8 s–1) were basically identical at the two pH values (Fig. 6). In the case of Mn-DAHP synthase, although the concentration of the active sites remained the same (28%), the burst (45 s–1 at pH 6.0) and the steady-state rates (24 s–1 at pH 6.0) were significantly affected by the change in pH (Fig. 2, open circle). The Cu-DAHP synthase showed the most drastic effect. At pH 6.5, the chemistry leading to product formation became rate-limiting, and the rate of product formation was 22 μm/s, which translates into a rate of 2.3 s–1 (Fig. 4, open circle). This value coincides with the rate determined by continuous spectrophotometric steady-state assay at the same pH. Deuterium Isotope Effect on Mn-DAHP Synthase Reaction—To investigate the presence or absence of a deuterium kinetic isotope effect on the product formation, two sets of burst experiments were performed at pH 6.0 and at pH 6.8 in protonated and deuterated 50 mm BTP buffer for Mn-DAHP synthase. A kinetic isotope effect on the rate constant of product formation would suggest that the steps leading to intermediate formation become rate-limiting for product formation. Performing the reaction at the physiologically relevant pH 6.8 or 7.5 resulted in burst rate constants higher than 200 s–1, precluding a reliable estimation of the kinetic isotope effect under these conditions. However, an isotope effect of 2 was observed on the rate constant of product release (Fig. 7, panel A). Lowering the reaction temperature did not lower the rate constant of product formation to values below 100 s–1 (data not shown). On the other hand, at pH 6.0 a deuterium kinetic isotope effect of 2 was observed for the burst rate constant (the rate constant of product formation) (62 versus 34 s–1), whereas no significant isotope effect was observed on the rate of product release (24 versus 18 s–1) (Fig. 7, panel B). To confirm further the rate constant of product formation, a presteady-state single turnover experiment was performed at pH 6.0 in protonated and deuterated buffer. The rate constants were 63 and 37 s–1, respectively (data not shown). This is in agreement with the rate constant of product formation determined from presteady-state burst experiment. As isolated, recombinant DAHP synthase contains 20–30% iron, whereas the remaining enzyme population contains variable amounts o"
https://openalex.org/W2034763339,"Previously, in vitro formation of thioether bonds between Hydrogenobacter thermophilus apocytochrome c552 and Fe-protoporphyrin IX has been demonstrated (Daltrop, O., Allen, J. W. A., Willis, A. C., and Ferguson, S. J. (2002) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 99, 7872–7876). Now we report studies on the reaction between the metalloderivatives Zn-, Co-, and Mn-protoporphyrin IX and the cysteine thiols of H. thermophilus apocytochrome c552. All of these metalloporphyrins were capable of forminga“b-type cytochrome” state in which the hydrophobic prosthetic group is bound non-covalently. Zn(II)-protoporphyrin IX attached to the polypeptide covalently in the presence of either dithiothreitol or tri(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine to keep the thiol moieties reduced. These data show that the chemical nature of the thiol-reducing agent does not interfere with the thioether bond-forming mechanism. Mn-porphyrin could only react with the protein in the divalent state of the metal ion. Co-porphyrin did not react with the cysteine thiols of the apocytochrome in either oxidation state of the metal. In the absence of a metal (i.e. protoporphyrin IX itself), no reactivity toward apocytochrome is observed. These results have significant implications for the chemical requirements for thioether bond formation of heme vinyl groups to cysteine thiols and also have potential applications in de novo design of metalloproteins. Previously, in vitro formation of thioether bonds between Hydrogenobacter thermophilus apocytochrome c552 and Fe-protoporphyrin IX has been demonstrated (Daltrop, O., Allen, J. W. A., Willis, A. C., and Ferguson, S. J. (2002) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 99, 7872–7876).

These results have significant implications for the chemical requirements for thioether bond formation of heme vinyl groups to cysteine thiols and also have potential applications in de novo design of metalloproteins. c-Type cytochromes are found in almost all of the organisms, mainly being involved in electron transport. They usually contain at least one characteristic CXXCH motif whereby the conserved cysteine residues are involved in forming covalent thioether bonds between the thiol functionalities and the vinyl groups of the prosthetic heme group (1Barker P.D.

Some aspects of the heme orientation during the in vitro formation of c-type cytochromes have been discussed previously (7Allen J.W.A. Barker P.D. Ferguson S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52075-52083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The general trend of apocytochromes c to form thioether bonds to heme vinyl groups has been demonstrated (8Daltrop O. Ferguson S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4404-4409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In this work, we report the in vitro studies on the reaction of metalloporphyrin derivatives of heme to throw more light on the chemical requirements for the thioether bond formation and the reactivity of the apocytochrome. In addition to gaining mechanistic insights into this bond formation, these studies are important for strategies of de novo protein design. Being able to incorporate covalently different metal-containing moieties under mild conditions may prove useful for synthesizing proteins used for electron transfer and other nanotechnological devices.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESWild-type, C11A, C14A, and C11A/C14A variants of Hydrogenobacter thermophilus c552 were expressed and purified as previously described (9Tomlinson E.J.

Chem. 1973; 248: 3188-3195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After the removal of the Ag+ by the addition of dithiothreitol (DTT), the proteins were dialyzed extensively in sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0, 20 mm). The H. thermophilus C11A/C14A apocytochrome variant was obtained according to the method of Tomlinson and Ferguson (10Tomlinson E.J. Ferguson S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5156-5160Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar).SDS-PAGE analysis was carried out using the buffer system described by Laemmli (12Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206048) Google Scholar). The concentration of apocytochrome was determined using the extinction coefficient 15.2 mm–1 cm–1 (calculated using the protein sequence) for wild-type and cysteine mutants (C11A, C14A, and C11A/C14A) of H. thermophilus c552. Visible absorption spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer Lambda 2 spectrophotometer in sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0, 50 mm). Pyridine hemochrome spectra were obtained according to the method of Bartsch (13Bartsch R.G. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 23: 344-363Crossref Scopus (197) Google Scholar) using 1.25–5 μm protein in 19% (v/v) pyridine and 0.15 m NaOH.Heme derivatives were purchased from Frontier Scientific. For the heme nomenclature, the “Fischer System of Nomenclature” is used (14Falk J.E. Porphyrins and Metalloporphyrins: Their General, Physical, and Coordination Chemistry and Laboratory Methods. 2. Elsevier, Amsterdam1964Google Scholar). H. thermophilus apocytochrome c552 wild-type, C11A, C14A, and C11A/C14A variants (5 μm) were incubated with metalloderivatives of heme (5 μm) in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, at 25 °C. Stock solutions (1 mm) of metalloderivatives of heme were prepared in Me2SO. Concentrations of (M-)PPIX were determined by weight and the following extinction coefficients: Zn-PPIX in phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, ϵ412 = 87.4 mm cm–1 (15Leonard J.J. Yonetani T. Callis J.B. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 1460-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar); Mn(III)-PPIX in 0.1 m NaOH, ϵ462 = 25 mm cm–1 (16Yonetani T. Asakura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 3996-3998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); Co(III)-PPIX in 0.1 m NaOH-pyridine, ϵ424 = 180 mm cm–1 (17Yonetani T. Yamamoto H. Woodrow III, G.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 682-690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); and PPIX in phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, ϵ536 = 7.0 mm cm–1 (15Leonard J.J. Yonetani T. Callis J.B. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 1460-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). PPIX was dissolved in glacial acetic acid and diluted into 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, to a final concentration of 100 μm. The formation of disulfide bonds in the apocytochrome was prevented by the addition of either DTT (5 mm) or tri(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) (10 mm). Mn- and Co-protoporphyrin were reduced by the addition of disodium dithionite. Solutions were thoroughly sparged with humidified argon, and reactions were carried out in the dark.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONZn(II)-protoporphyrin—Apocytochrome c was shown to be pure by SDS-PAGE analysis and contained no absorption peaks in the visible region (data not shown). When Zn(II)-PPIX was added to the apoprotein, a spectrum corresponding to a “b-type cytochrome” state was obtained whereby the ligation state of the zinc changed in the presence of the protein relative to the Zn-porphyrin by itself (Fig. 2). Bands appeared around 428, 552, and 590 nm in the visible absorption spectrum (Table I). This observation suggested that the hydrophobic pocket of the apoprotein is such that it can accommodate metalloderivatives of heme and that the vacant coordination site of the protein is not specific to the iron metal. This non-covalent binding was also evidenced by passing the M-PPIX-protein complex through a desalting column. The colored band moved with the protein fraction, and the resulting eluent had a visible spectrum of the Zn-PPIX-protein complex. The spectral features of this Zn-PPIX “cytochrome b” compare well with the values obtained for zinc-protomyoglobin from sperm whale myoglobin (Table I) (18Nocek J.M. Sishta B.P. Cameron J.C.

Allen J.W.A. Willis A.C. Ferguson S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7872-7876Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and is a strong indication of thioether bond formation between the heme vinyl groups and the apocytochrome. Importantly, the time scale of this spectral change of the reaction with Zn-PPIX was very similar to the kinetics of the thioether bond formation between H. thermophilus apocytochrome c552 and (Fe-)heme, implying a similar reaction mechanism irrespective of the metal present. The pyridine metallochrome spectrum had blue-shifted over time as well (Table I), indicating the saturation of the protoporphyrin vinyl groups. The covalent attachment was further evidenced by recording an electrospray mass spectrometry spectrum, which had a peak corresponding to the apocytochrome plus Zn-protoporphyrin IX (9,325 Da). A non-covalent complex gave only the mass of the apoprotein (8,702 Da) as the prosthetic group dissociates from the protein in this analytical technique. The reaction was shown to involve the cysteine residues as the C11A/C14A variant of H. thermophilus cytochrome c552 was only able to form the non-covalent complex but did not show any changes in the visible spectrum over the same time period as the wild-type protein did. Interestingly, the spectrum of Zn-PPIX with the C11A/C14A variant of H. thermophilus cytochrome c552 was slightly different from the spectrum obtained for the non-covalent complex of wild-type protein with Zn-PPIX (Table I). This might indicate that a cysteine can be a ligand to the zinc ion in the initial Zn-PPIX-protein complex. As both the single cysteine C11A and C14A variants of H. thermophilus apocytochrome c552 give rise to the same visible spectrum with Zn-PPIX as the wild-type protein, either cysteine could be causing the spectral change relative to the C11A/C14A variant of H. thermophilus cytochrome c552-Zn-PPIX complex. The spectra obtained for the H. thermophilus apocytochrome c552 with covalently attached Zn-PPIX compare very well with the Zn-PPIX derivative of horse heart cytochrome c (Table I) (19Vanderkooi J.M. Adar F. Erecinska M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 64: 381-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Structural analysis of the latter zinc-substituted cytochrome c revealed that the overall folding of the secondary structure elements, including the ligation, are very close to the native Fe-heme horse heart cytochrome c (20Qian C. Yao Y. Tong Y. Wang J. Tang W. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2003; 8: 394-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is assumed that the Zn-derivative of H. thermophilus cytochrome c552 has a very similar structure to the wild-type iron-containing form.To test whether the reductant of the potential mixed disulfide between the apoprotein and DTT had any effect on the reaction of thioether bond formation, DTT was omitted from the reaction and replaced by the phosphine TCEP. The reaction proceeded in the same fashion with either reductant. As these two reductants have different chemical means of reducing a disulfide, DTT being a thiol-based reagent and TCEP being a phosphine, it can be excluded for the first time that a disulfide bond involving a cysteine thiol occurs, thus possibly providing a thiol leaving group, and that it is thiols of the protein that react directly to form a thioether bond between heme and the protein. This is an important result for understanding the chemistry of uncatalyzed thioether bond formation but does not necessarily mean that a leaving group attached to the apoprotein or heme is not involved in one or more of the known biogenesis systems.The findings of the in vitro thioether bond formation with Zn-PPIX are also of interest with respect to the recent report of a novel hemoglobin that can form a bond from a histidine side chain to a vinyl of heme in vitro (21Vu B.C. Jones A.D. Lecomte J.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 8544-8545Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The latter reaction fails with Zn-PPIX (21Vu B.C. Jones A.D. Lecomte J.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 8544-8545Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), thus implying a distinct reaction mechanism possibly involving a redox active center with the Fe2+/Fe3+ oxidation state transitions of the heme iron.Mn-protoporphyrin—When Mn(III)-PPIX was added to H. thermophilus apocytochrome c552, the ligation state of the metal changed relative to the free Mn(III)-PPIX as judged from the visible absorption spectrum (Fig. 3A). The same observation was made with the C11A/C14A mutant of H. thermophilus apocytochrome c552 (Table I). However, when the (non-covalent) putative Mn-PPIX-protein complex with either the wild-type protein or C11A/C14A apocytochrome variant was passed through a desalting column, the protein was separated from the metallo-cofactor. This indicates that the protein-Mn-PPIX complex is held together more loosely compared with the heme (4Daltrop O. Allen J.W.A. Willis A.C. Ferguson S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7872-7876Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and Zn-PPIX protein complexes. The reason for this is not determined, but the hydrophobic pocket of the apoprotein does not appear to accommodate the Mn-PPIX as well as the Fe- and Zn-PPIX. This result is consistent with studies on other heme proteins and metalloporphyrin derivatives thereof (22Dickinson L.C. Chien J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 6156-6162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Gruenke L.D. Sun J. Loehr T.M. Waskell L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7114-7125Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). It has been argued that the size of the manganese ion leads to an out of plane position of the metal relative to the protoporphyrin plane, which causes one of the axial ligands to be closer to the metal than the trans ligand (22Dickinson L.C. Chien J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 6156-6162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Gruenke L.D. Sun J. Loehr T.M. Waskell L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7114-7125Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, the ligation requirement of this metal cannot be the only reason, because PPIX itself binds to the apoprotein (see “Protoporphyrin”). Therefore, one major contributor to the binding of the M-PPIX is the steric fit into the hydrophobic pocket. The visible spectrum of the Mn(III)-PPIX complex remained unchanged for 20 h and thus indicates that no chemical modification took place in this oxidation state of the Mn-PPIX. The spectrum compares well with spectra obtained for Mn(III) derivatives of cytochrome b5 (23Gruenke L.D. Sun J. Loehr T.M. Waskell L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7114-7125Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), myoglobin (24Yonetani T. Asakura T. J. Biol.

The same trend was observed around 559 and 595 nm (Fig. 3B and Table I), i.e. bands characteristic of the presence of a ligated metalloporphyrin, which had a yellow appearance. The pyridine metallochrome spectrum of this mixture immediately after mixing had its α-band at 594 nm, indicating that the Mn-PPIX contained two unreacted vinyl groups. These results show that the apoprotein and Mn-PPIX initially form a “b-type cytochrome” in which the Mn-PPIX is not covalently attached to the peptide but in which its Mn(II) ion is coordinated by amino acid side chains from the protein. Similar bands in the visible spectrum were observed when the C11A/C14A mutant of H. thermophilus apocytochrome c552 was incubated with Mn(II)-porphyrin. However, as in the case of the Zn-PPIX protein complex, a spectral difference between the wild-type and C11A/C14A variant of H. thermophilus cytochrome c552 was observed. This again might indicate the involvement of a cysteine in the initial ligation process to the metalloporphyrin, which is reflected here in a small steady state in a subpopulation of the Mn-PPIX-protein mixture. It is apparent that the spectrum for the Mn-derivative of H. thermophilus cytochrome c552 is characteristic of a portion of the metal being in a low spin configuration, which is in contrast with the high spin state observed for cytochrome b5 (23Gruenke L.D. Sun J. Loehr T.M. Waskell L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7114-7125Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and horse heart cytochrome c (22Dickinson L.C. Chien J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 6156-6162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Over a time period of 10 h, the spectrum of the mixture of Mn2+-PPIX in wild-type apocytochrome containing cysteines in the CXXCH heme binding motif had blue-shifted, whereas the AXXAH variant remained unchanged. The pyridine metallochrome spectrum of the initial wild-type protein-Mn-PPIX complex also had blue-shifted over time, indicating that the vinyl groups became saturated. When passing this complex through a desalting column, a fraction of the protein band retained the color and hence the metallo-cofactor. Because most of the Mn-PPIX dissociates from the protein on the desalting column when bound non-covalently, this was an indication that a fraction of the non-covalent Mn(II)-PPIX can react with the cysteine thiols to yield thioether bonds. Covalent attachment of the Mn(II)-PPIX to a fraction of the protein was substantiated by electrospray mass spectrometry analysis. Further evidence that the majority of this protein species contains covalently rather than non-covalently bound Mn-PPIX came from a comparison of the pyridine metallochrome spectrum of a precipitated and solvent-extracted sample, which had its α-band at 589 nm representing the fully covalently attached Mn(II)-PPIX derivative, with that of the M-PPIX protein complex obtained after desalting (Table I). Because the spectra are almost identical, most of the non-covalently attached Mn(II)-PPIX was removed during desalting. The visible spectrum for the desalted Mn(II)-PPIX-protein is shown (Fig. 3B and Table I). However, the yield of covalently bound Mn-PPIX-cytochrome was not quantitative. When a 1:1 M-PPIX-protein complex was incubated under reductive conditions, only 20–30% of covalently attached Mn-PPIX cytochrome was obtained after desalting with the remainder being apoprotein as judged from the ratio of the absorbance at 280 and 429 nm. When protein was added in a 5-fold excess over the Mn(II)-PPIX, the yield of covalently attached Mn(II)-PPIX cytochrome increased up to 50%. It is unclear why the reaction could not be quantitative, but it is assumed that the attachment is less efficient with Mn(II)-PPIX than with Fe(II)-PPIX and Zn-PPIX.The experiments with the two oxidation states of Mn-PPIX showed an interesting change in reactivity of the cysteine thiols depending on the oxidation state of the manganese. The divalent state of the metal is required for the covalent bond formation. This study is consistent with the observation that controlled thioether bond formation between (Fe-)heme and apocytochrome c requires the ferrous oxidation state (4Daltrop O. Allen J.W.A. Willis A.C. Ferguson S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7872-7876Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This observation is also interesting, because the electron occupancy in the metal d-orbitals is different but does not have a pronounced effect on the kinetics of the thioether bond formation.Co-protoporphyrin—When Co(III)-PPIX was added to the apocytochrome, the visible spectrum showed that the coordination around the cobalt had changed relative to Co(III)-PPIX itself (Fig. 4A). The assumption that a Co-PPIX-protein complex had formed was further demonstrated by passing the protein through a desalting column, which did not separate the cofactor from the protein fraction. This protein species was stable for several hours as judged from the visible spectrum. The spectrum was indicative of a low spin state of the cobaltic ion, which is consistent with the chemical property of this metal (25Dickinson L.C. Chien J.C. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 3526-3534Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 26Ridsdale S. Cassatt J.C. Steinhardt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 771-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). No modification of the Co-PPIX was observed as judged from the spectra including the pyridine addition (metallochrome) spectra (Table I). Very similar spectra were obtained with the C11A/C14A variant of H. thermophilus apocytochrome (Table I). These experiments indicate that the cysteine might not play an important role in the initial ligation of the metalloporphyrin, thus differing from the case of Zn- and Mn-PPIX. Overall, the spectra agree with those obtained for other Co-derivatized metalloproteins (Table I). Co-PPIX was capable of binding strongly to the apocytochrome in contrast to Mn-PPIX. Interestingly, Co(III)-PPIX was not capable of forming thioether bonds with the cysteines of apocytochrome c. The reaction might have been anticipated to occur given that Co3+ is isoelectronic with Fe2+. This observation implies that the charge on the trivalent Co(III) was incompatible with thioether bond formation. In accordance with the experimental data showing that Fe(II)-, Zn(II)-, and Mn(II)-PPIX can react with apocytochrome c, it appears that a divalent state of the metal is favorable for thioether bond formation in c-type cytochromes. Therefore, covalent bond formation within a M-PPIX-cytochrome complex seems to be hindered by a build-up of too much positive charge around the porphyrin.Fig. 4A, visible spectrum of the noncovalent form of Co(III)-PPIX and H. thermophilus cytochrome c552 (∼6 μm).

https://openalex.org/W1989253513,"CooA is a homodimeric transcriptional activator from Rhodospirillum rubrum containing one heme in each subunit. CO binding to the heme in its sensor domain activates CooA, facilitating the binding to DNA by its DNA-binding domain. The C-helix links the two domains and shapes an interface between the subunits. To probe the nature of CO activation, residues at positions 112–121 on the C-helix were replaced by Asn or Gln and their effects were evaluated by resonance Raman spectroscopy and by the measurements of CO binding affinity. The ν(Fe-CO) stretching Raman line in CO-bound wild-type CooA was up-shifted by 6 cm-1 in the L116Q, G117N, and L120Q mutants, indicating unequivocally that these residues are close to the bound CO. Residues Leu116 and Leu120 from each subunit form contacts with the corresponding residues in the opposite subunit, enabling hydrophobic interactions in the inactive ferrous form. Thus, in the CO-bound activated form, both C-helices appear to roll to direct these residues toward the heme, forming a hydrophobic pocket for the bound CO. The CO affinity is approximately one order of magnitude higher in the L112Q, I115Q, L116Q, G117N, L120Q, and T121N mutants but reduced in A114N mutant. The variation indicates that these residues are close to the heme in the ferrous and/or CO-bound forms and are responsible for CooA activation. A roll-and-slide mechanism is proposed for CO activation of CooA. CooA is a homodimeric transcriptional activator from Rhodospirillum rubrum containing one heme in each subunit. CO binding to the heme in its sensor domain activates CooA, facilitating the binding to DNA by its DNA-binding domain. The C-helix links the two domains and shapes an interface between the subunits.

Residues Leu116 and Leu120 from each subunit form contacts with the corresponding residues in the opposite subunit, enabling hydrophobic interactions in the inactive ferrous form. Thus, in the CO-bound activated form, both C-helices appear to roll to direct these residues toward the heme, forming a hydrophobic pocket for the bound CO. The CO affinity is approximately one order of magnitude higher in the L112Q, I115Q, L116Q, G117N, L120Q, and T121N mutants but reduced in A114N mutant. The variation indicates that these residues are close to the heme in the ferrous and/or CO-bound forms and are responsible for CooA activation. A roll-and-slide mechanism is proposed for CO activation of CooA. CooA from the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodospirillum rubrum is a heme-based transcription factor that is activated upon binding CO (1Aono S. Nakajima H. Saito K. Okada M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Coppoc L.J. Ludden P.W. Roberts G.P. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 74: 5284-5294Crossref Google Scholar). CooA is a homodimer (221 amino acids/monomer) containing a DNA-binding and a sensor domain analogous to those found in the cAMP receptor protein (CRP) 1The abbreviations used are: CRP, cAMP receptor protein; WT, wild type.

Because CooA is the first example of a CO sensor protein (1Aono S. Nakajima H. Saito K. Okada M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 752-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 2Shelver D. Kerby R.L. He Y. Roberts G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11216-11220Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), its CO sensing and activation mechanisms have been attracting the attention of many researchers (11Rodgers K.R. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1999; 3: 158-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 12Chan M.K. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2001; 5: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 13Aono S. Acc. Chem.

The signal of CO binding to the heme is transmitted to the DNA-binding domain, directing the protein to its target DNA sequence, which is palindromic (15He Y. Shelver D. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 120-123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 16Fox J.D. He Y. Shelver D. Roberts G.P. Ludden P.W. J.

Commun. 1999; 261: 270-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Because the two domains are linked by a long α-helix (C-helix), the residues on the C-helix must play a key role in signal transmission from the heme-containing domain to the DNA-binding domain and hence CO activation of CooA. The C-helices form a coiled-coil structure, which shapes the dimer interface in the inactive ferrous form (Fig. 1). As summarized in Table I, the Cα atoms of Ile113, Leu116, Leu120, Cys123, and Ile127 on the respective subunits are in close proximity to each other (<7.0 Å) in CooA as in the optimal leucine zipper alignment. To reveal the activation mechanism, it is potentially informative to inspect the structural difference between CooA and CRP, which is homologous to CooA and whose cAMP-bound activated structure is available (18Passner J.M. Schultz S.C. Steitz T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 847-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The Cα atoms in the C-helix of CRP (residues at position 112–136) are organized in a similar way to the corresponding region of CooA (Table I), and the difference in the distances between the inactive ferrous CooA and active cAMP-bound CRP is not apparent. Thus, it is unclear what kind of structure is required for the activation of these transcription factors.Table IDistances between specific atoms of residues in the C-helix region All of the values are calculated with atomic coordinate sets of ferrous inactive CooA (Protein Data Bank code 1FT9) (4Lanzilotta W.N.

Williams R.D. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. Spiro T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35384-35393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) revealed that the side chains of Ile113 and Leu116 are close to the CO in the ferrous CO-bound CooA. When Leu116 is replaced by the heme-coordinating lysine residue, CooA is active both in the presence and absence of CO (20Youn H. Kerby R.L. Thorsteinsson M.V. Clark R.W. Burstyn J.N. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33616-33623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The importance of the nearby Gly117 to CooA activation has also been stressed (21Youn H. Kerby R.L. Thorsteinsson M.V. Conrad M. Staples C.R. Serate J. Beack J. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41603-41610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Thus, it is believed that residues in this region are crucial for CooA activation. Although these pieces of evidence are informative, the mutation studies have not been systematic so far and the role of the C-helix in CO activation remains to be fully elucidated. In our strategy, we at first inspected the distances between the heme iron and each Cα atom on the C-helix with the atomic coordinate set of the inactive ferrous form (4Lanzilotta W.N. Schuller D.J. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) (Table I). Because CooA is homodimeric, the two Cα-Fe distances within the respective subunits (d(Cα-Fe)) are averaged and the deviation is given. Similarly, two distances from iron to Cα atoms on the opposite subunit (d(Cα-Fe′)) are evaluated. Although the deviations in the C-terminal half of the C-helix are relatively large, the distances in the N-terminal half are well conserved between the subunits (the deviations are <0.1 Å). The Cα atoms of Leu112 and Leu116 are relatively close to the heme iron within the same subunit (<10 Å), whereas those of Ile113, Ala114, Gly117, Arg118, and Thr121 are close to the iron in the opposite subunit. Thus, in this study, 10 residues at positions from 112 to 121 have been systematically mutated and the mutated proteins have been examined by resonance Raman spectroscopy and by the measurement of CO binding affinity. We conclude that the C-helix rolls to direct residues Leu116, Gly117, and Leu120 toward the heme and that there is a concomitant sliding of the heme with respect to the C-helix. Therefore, we propose a roll-and-slide model for CO activation of CooA. Preparation of CooA Mutants—We have reported a high expression system for CooA, which employs a synthetic gene optimized for expression in Escherichia coli (8Yamashita T. Hoashi Y. Watanabe K. Tomisugi Y. Ishikawa Y. Uno T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21394-21400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The QuikChange system (Stratagene) was used to introduce mutations into the CooA coding sequence, and the DNA sequence of the plasmid products were confirmed with a Li-Cor Model 4200S2 DNA sequencer. Cell growth and protein purification were performed as described previously (6Shelver D. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Chung S.Y. Roberts G.P. Reynolds M.F. Parks R.B. Burstyn J.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2669-2678Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Soluble fractions of the cell extract were applied to a Q-Sepharose FF column (Amersham Biosciences), and the adsorbed proteins were eluted with linear gradient of NaCl in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). The CooA fractions were subsequently purified by Sephacryl S-100 column chromatography (Amersham Biosciences) and concentrated (Amicon Ultra-15, Millipore). Proteins were purified to homogeneity as judged by SDS-PAGE criteria. CooA concentrations were evaluated from the heme content, which was measured by a pyridine hemochrome assay, and hence were based on a monomer unit. Resonance Raman Spectroscopy—The spectra were recorded using a double monochromator (Jasco R-800) with a slit width of 6 cm-1 following excitation by a krypton ion laser (406.7-nm line, Coherent I-302). A photomultiplier detector was used (Hamamatsu Photonics, R595), and the frequencies were calibrated with indene. The frequencies reported are accurate within 1 cm-1 for sharp and discrete Raman lines. A spinning Raman cell was used throughout the measurements to minimize local heating and sample damage. The samples contained 100 μm protein in 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Ferrous proteins were prepared by the addition of sodium dithionite after purging extensively with nitrogen gas. The carbonmonoxy forms were prepared by the addition of sodium dithionite under 1 atm CO. The spectra of the CO forms were obtained with a defocused laser beam. CO Titration—CO titration of ferrous CooA was performed in 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) at 25 °C as described previously (8Yamashita T. Hoashi Y. Watanabe K. Tomisugi Y. Ishikawa Y. Uno T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21394-21400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). A cuvette was filled with a CooA solution, which was purged extensively with nitrogen gas stoppered with a rubber septum, and the protein was reduced by an excess of sodium dithionite solution, which was injected by a syringe. Full reduction of CooA was confirmed by absorption spectroscopy (Beckman DU640). Aliquots of CO saturated in 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and dithionite were added to solutions containing ∼2 μm protein, and the absorption spectra were recorded. The CO concentrations were calibrated using pig myoglobin. The absorbance changes at the Q-band maxima were traced and analyzed after normalization. Ferric and Ferrous CooAs—In our mutation strategy, those residues having long and hydrophobic side chains (Leu and Ile) were replaced by Gln, which has long but polar side chain. On the other hand, small residues (Ala, Gly, and Thr) were replaced by the short and polar Asn, which is analogous to Gln. Arg118, the sole charged residue in our target set, was replaced by the hydrophobic Leu. The effect of these mutations was evaluated by resonance Raman spectroscopy, which is a powerful tool for revealing the coordination states of heme iron (22Spiro T.G. Li X.-Y. Spiro T.G. Biological Applications of Raman Spectroscopy. 3. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1988: 1-38Google Scholar, 23Kincaid J.R. Kadish K.M. Smith K.M. Guilard R. The Porphyrin Handbook. 7. Academic Press, San Diego2000: 227-291Google Scholar). In the ferric state, the spectral profiles of these mutants are essentially the same as that of WT CooA (Fig. 2). ν2, ν38, and ν3 lines, which are sensitive to the iron coordination state, are observed at 1583, 1549, and 1501 cm-1, respectively, indicating that the Cys75 and Pro2 ligands in the WT CooA are unperturbed by the mutations. However, in the A114N, I115Q, and A119N mutants, the ν38 line appears stronger than the ν2 line and it is also slightly up-shifted. In these mutants, a relatively strong line is observed at 268 cm-1, which is assignable to the δ(CβC1) bending vibration of peripheral carbon atom of the heme (24Hu S. Smith K.M. Spiro T.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 12638-12646Crossref Scopus (476) Google Scholar). In the ferrous CooA mutants, the resonance Raman spectra are again essentially the same as those of the WT protein (Fig. 3). The ν2, ν38, and ν3 lines are observed at 1581, 1555, and 1493 cm-1, respectively, corresponding to six-coordination with axial ligands contributed by the His77 and Pro2 side chains (Fig. 1). However, in the L116Q, G117N, and L120Q mutants, the ν2 and ν38 lines are slightly up-shifted and a weak line appears around 1470 cm-1 (ν3). A similar profile was detected in the P2H and H77A mutants of CooA in which one of the Pro2-His77 axial ligands is replaced (8Yamashita T. Hoashi Y. Watanabe K. Tomisugi Y. Ishikawa Y. Uno T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21394-21400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Thus, some of the C-helix residues affect the axial coordination of the ferric and ferrous hemes in CooA but the effects are slight. CO Probe—In Fig. 4, resonance Raman spectra of ferrous CO-bound CooA are shown. The ν(Fe-CO) stretching frequency is sensitive to the polarity of the residues surrounding the bound CO, and it therefore represents an excellent probe of the distal environment (25Uno T.

Chem. 1998; 273: 19988-19992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), indicating that the bound CO is in a hydrophobic distal environment. This line is clearly affected by mutations of some of the C-helix residues, and especially noted are the large up-shifts of 6 cm-1 in the L116Q, G117N, and L120Q mutants. A small but measurable up-shift of 3 cm-1 in the L112Q and A119N mutants is also noted. In these mutants, hydrophobic residues are replaced by polar Gln or Asn residues. The effect of hydrophobic to polar substitutions on the ν(Fe-CO) stretching frequency has been reported in myoglobin (31Sakan Y. Ogura T. Kitagawa T. Fraunfelter F.A. Mattera R. Ikeda-Saito M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5815-5824Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In ferrous CO-bound myoglobin, the bound CO is close to the distal His64 and the ν(Fe-CO) stretching line is observed at ∼510 cm-1 (32Tsubaki M. Srivastava R.B. Yu N.-T. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1132-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 33Uno T. Sakamoto R. Tomisugi Y. Ishikawa Y. Wilkinson A.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 10191-10199Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The line is observed at 490 cm-1 in H64L and at 492 cm-1 in H64I mutants that have apolar replacements, but it is restored to 508 cm-1 in H64Q (31Sakan Y. Ogura T. Kitagawa T. Fraunfelter F.A. Mattera R. Ikeda-Saito M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5815-5824Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Thus, it is clear that Leu116, Gly117, and Leu120 in WT CooA are close to the bound CO, contributing to a hydrophobic distal heme pocket. Leu112 and Ala119 may also locate close to the CO but in a rather remote fashion. The frequency of the ν(Fe-CO) stretch and the shift values relative to that in WT protein are summarized in Table II.Table IIν(Fe-CO) frequencies and CO dissociation constants of ferrous CO-Bound CooAResidueν(Fe-CO)/cm–1Δν(Fe-CO)aFrequency shift relative to WT CooA.

The values greater than +1 or smaller than –1 are shown in boldface Open table in a new tab Along with the frequency shift, the band shape of the ν(Fe-CO) stretch is slightly affected by the mutations of some of the C-helix residues (Fig. 4). The ν(Fe-CO) lines are relatively broad in the I113Q, A114N, L116Q, and L120Q mutants, suggesting the fluctuation in the Fe-CO geometry. A minor band seems to exist at ∼520 cm-1 in the I115Q mutant, and the presence of multiple Fe-CO conformers is suggested. Similar multiple ν(Fe-CO) stretching modes were detected in some of the His77 axial ligand mutants of CooA (8Yamashita T. Hoashi Y. Watanabe K. Tomisugi Y. Ishikawa Y. Uno T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21394-21400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and hence, the Fe-His bond may partly be affected in the I115Q mutant. The main ν(Fe-CO) stretching frequency at 489 cm-1, however, is almost the same as that in WT CooA; hence, Ile115 is suggested to be remote from the heme in the CO-bound state. Because some of the C-helix residues affect the bound CO, the effect of these residues on the CO binding affinity was evaluated. The CO dissociation constants (Kd) for the ferrous-CO bound CooA mutants are given in Table II. The CO affinity of WT CooA (Kd = 11 μm) is similar to that for FixL (9.0 μm) (34Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Gonzalez G. Perutz M.F. Kiger L. Marden M.C. Poyart C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8067-8073Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) and Dos (10 μm) (35Delgado-Nixon V.M. Gonzalez G.

Although the CO binding kinetics is reported to be multi-step (36Puranik M. Nielsen S.B. Youn H. Hvitved A.N. Bourassa J.L. Case M.A. Tengroth C. Balakrishnan G. Thorsteinsson M.V. Groves J.T.

Chem. 2000; 275: 38378-38383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), the equilibrium CO binding is a one-step process (8Yamashita T. Hoashi Y. Watanabe K. Tomisugi Y. Ishikawa Y. Uno T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21394-21400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Thus, binding was analyzed in terms of a simple equilibrium between the ferrous and CO-bound forms of the protein. The Kd values generally decreased in the C-helix mutants, indicating that polar side chains in the mutants facilitate CO binding to the ferrous heme. The logarithm of the ratio of the Kd values for the mutant and WT CooA (i.e. Δlog Kd) is calculated and also summarized in Table II. The CO affinity is less affected in I113Q and R118L, indicating that Ile113 and Arg118 are remote from the heme. It should be noted here that the Kd value greatly increased in the A114N mutant. Thus, Ala114 is suggested to play a key role in CO activation of CooA. Because of this low affinity, resonance Raman measurement of CO-bound A114N was very difficult (Fig. 4) and the laser power had to be reduced to 0.3 milliwatts. Even under this condition, the ferrous heme is not fully coordinating CO because saturated CO concentration is 1 mm. This is the main reason for the relatively weak ν(Fe-CO) stretching line in this mutant. Inactive Ferrous Form—In Fig. 5, the positions of C-helix residues are schematically drawn in rectangle and in helical wheel projection models. Because the C-helix shapes a coiled-coil structure in the inactive ferrous form (4Lanzilotta W.N. Schuller D.J. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), a 3.5 residue/turn scheme was adopted. As summarized in Table I, the Cα atoms of Ile113, Leu116, Leu120, Cys123, and Ile127 residues on the respective subunits are located close to each other (<7.0 Å) and these residues are marked with small pink circles (Fig. 5, top). It is clear that these residues align on one face of the C-helix and shape a dimer interface. The Cα atoms of Leu112 and Leu116 (marked with cyan circles) are close to the ferrous heme within the same subunit, whereas those of Ile113, Ala114, Gly117, Arg118, and Thr121 (marked with green circles) are close to the heme within the opposite subunit. Pro2, one of the heme axial ligands, is provided by the opposite subunit and is shown in green. In the ferric state, the A114N, I115Q, and A119N mutants affected the relative intensity of the ν38 and δ(CβC1) bending modes (Fig. 2) and, hence, these residues are probably close to the heme periphery in the WT CooA. In the crystal structure of ferrous CooA (4Lanzilotta W.N. Schuller D.J. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), the side chain of Ile115 is close to the heme 1-methyl and 2-vinyl groups and Ala119 is close to the 1-methyl group, although Ala114 is remote from the heme periphery (Fig. 1). The proximal ligand in the ferric state is the side chain of Cys75, which is replaced by that of His77 in the ferrous state (6Shelver D. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Chung S.Y. Roberts G.P. Reynolds M.F. Parks R.B. Burstyn J.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2669-2678Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 7Aono S. Ohkubo K. Matsuo T. Nakajima H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25757-25764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The redox-linked ligand exchange in CooA may reposition the heme, providing a close contact of heme periphery with Ala114 side chain. In the ferrous state, the mutation of residues Leu116, Gly117, and Leu120 slightly affected the axial coordination of the heme (Fig. 3). Because His77 ligand is opposite to the heme plane when viewed from the C-helix, relatively weak coordination by Pro2 ligand (8Yamashita T. Hoashi Y. Watanabe K. Tomisugi Y. Ishikawa Y. Uno T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21394-21400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) should be affected by the mutation. It has been reported that the replacement of Gly117 with Ile sterically perturbs Pro2 coordination (21Youn H. Kerby R.L. Thorsteinsson M.V. Conrad M. Staples C.R. Serate J. Beack J. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41603-41610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and this is similar to that observed in our G117N mutant. In these Leu116, Gly117, and Leu120 mutants, the Kd values for CO dissociation increased by ∼10-fold (Table II). Although many factors may affect CO affinity, this increase may partly be attributed to the weaker Pro2 coordination in these mutants. Pro2 coordination greatly reduces the CO affinity, and this coordination is the way in which CooA regulates its CO-sensing level (8Yamashita T. Hoashi Y. Watanabe K. Tomisugi Y. Ishikawa Y. Uno T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21394-21400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Leu116 and Leu120 locate in the dimer interface in the inactive ferrous state, and the side chain of Leu120 is too far from the Pro2 ligand for direct interaction (Fig. 5, top). Thus, the C-helices must roll relative to each other at least in the L120Q mutant to weaken the Fe-Pro2 bond in the ferrous state. The replacement of these aliphatic residues by the polar Gln should weaken the hydrophobic interaction between the helices. This may promote the rolling of the helices, mimicking the active CO-bound form as described below and facilitating CO binding with high affinity. Active Ferrous-CO Form—As we revealed previously (8Yamashita T. Hoashi Y. Watanabe K. Tomisugi Y. Ishikawa Y. Uno T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21394-21400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), the Pro2 ligand is replaced by the incoming CO molecule and this replacement triggers CooA activation (11Rodgers K.R. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1999; 3: 158-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 12Chan M.K. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2001; 5: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 13Aono S. Acc.

The residues affecting the ν(Fe-CO) stretch (Fig. 4) by >3 cm-1 are marked with red circles (Fig. 5). Among these residues, the effects of Leu116, Gly117, and Leu120 mutation were dominant again; hence, these three residues appear to be located close to the CO molecule. Because Leu116 and Leu120 locate at the dimer interface in the ferrous state, the C-helices must roll to direct these residues to the CO molecules. To maximize the interaction between these residues and CO, the hemes must slide along the C-helices. Because Pro2 is provided from the opposite subunit, CO replacement should heave the Pro2 anchor in CooA. This should increase the freedom for relative movement of C-helices and hemes. Regardless, the movement of both helices as well as both hemes must be symmetrical because CooA is homodimeric and the recognition sequence of CooA is palindromic (15He Y. Shelver D. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 120-123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 16Fox J.D. He Y. Shelver D. Roberts G.P. Ludden P.W. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6200-6208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Aono S. Takasaki H. Unno H. Kamiya T. Nakajima H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 270-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The residues that affected the CO affinity more than one order of magnitude are marked by small purple circles in Fig. 5 (bottom). The CO affinity increased predominantly in the L112Q, I115Q, L116Q, Gl117N, L120Q, and T121N mutants. The Leu116, Gly117, and Leu120 side chains are close to one another on one face of the C-helix, thus lining the distal heme pocket and greatly affecting the CO affinity. The remaining Leu112, Ile115, and Thr121 residues are directed outward from the dimer interface in the ferrous form (Fig. 5, top) and may not interact directly with the bound CO. These residues surround the Leu116, Gly117, and Leu120 triad, possibly forming an entrance allowing CO to access the heme. Among the CooA mutants examined, A114N is the sole mutant, which greatly reduced the CO affinity, although Gly117 and Thr121, which lie on the same C-helix face, enhanced the CO affinity when replaced by Asn. It is interesting to note that Ala114 is sandwiched by Gly111 and Gly117, which have small side chains. Such small residues may facilitate the helical roll in the CO activation. When the small Ala114 is substituted by the polar and bulkier Asn, it may inhibit C-helix rolling. This inhibition may stabilize the ferrous inactive form so that CO affinity is reduced. Roll-and-Slide Model—As discussed above, the C-helices must roll, and here, we propose a roll-and-slide model for the CO activation of CooA (Fig. 5, bottom). In this section, we validate the model based on the experimental evidence. Since A114N showed low CO affinity, we propose that Ala114 could be the fulcrum of the helix rolling to shape the CO-bound form. This means that the heme must slide to the C-terminal side on the helix, and this view is consistent with the close proximity of the Leu116, Gly117, and Leu120 triad to the CO-bound heme. Leu116 is reported to be crucial for CooA activity, and the L116K mutant is active in both ferrous and CO-bound states (20Youn H. Kerby R.L. Thorsteinsson M.V. Clark R.W. Burstyn J.N. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33616-33623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Leu116 is close to the heme in our model (Fig. 5, bottom), enabling the coordination of Lys side chain in L116K. It is proposed (19Coyle C.M. Puranik M. Youn H. Nielsen S.B. Williams R.D. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. Spiro T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35384-35393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) that the C-helix relatively moves upon the CO binding and that the heme also moves to the N-terminal side. In our systematic mutation study, however, we favor the movement of the heme toward the C-terminal portion of the C-helices for the reasons outlined below. In the I113Q mutant, the Kd value and ν(Fe-CO) stretching frequency are less affected than in the other mutants examined (Table II), although Ile113 is one helical turn up from Leu116 and Gly117 and is close to the heme (marked with green circle in Fig. 5, top). In contrast, Met124 is reported to affect iron coordination in the activated form (38Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Youn H. Conrad M. Serate J. Staples C.R. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26807-26813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This residue is one helical turn down from Leu120, supporting the notion of translation of the heme toward the C terminus of the helix. Three major factors contribute to cofactor retention in heme proteins (39Hargrove M.S. Wilkinson A.J. Olson J.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11300-11309Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar): (i) covalent bonding between the heme iron and axial ligand residues; (ii) apolar interactions between the heme and surrounding hydrophobic residues; and (iii) polar interactions between the heme propionates and surrounding hydrophilic residues (40Uno T. Yukinari A. Moriyama Y. Ishikawa Y. Tomisugi Y. Brannigan J.A. Wilkinson A.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 512-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In ferrous CooA, the bonds to the Pro2-His77 ligands may be enough to anchor the heme, although the heme propionate is not surrounded by amino acid side chains. However, in the CO-bound state, Pro2 is replaced by CO, requiring a compensating mechanism for the heme retention. In our model, the helical roll may allow the positively charged Arg118 to interact favorably with the negatively charged heme propionate in the opposite subunit. Although Arg118 interacts with Asp72 in the ferrous form (4Lanzilotta W.N. Schuller D.J. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), this residue may partly contribute electrostatically to the stabilization of the slipped heme. In summary, the C-helix in CooA rolls upon CO binding to the heme as revealed by resonance Raman spectra and CO dissociation constants. We propose a roll-and-slide model for the CO activation mechanism of CooA. This model satisfactorily accounts for our observations as well as those reported earlier. Although further studies on the interactions between the C-helices and the DNA-binding domains are required, our roll-and-slide model may be a good starting point for fully understanding the CO activation mechanism. We thank Dr. Anthony J. Wilkinson (University of York) for valuable discussion."

Proteins that sense small gaseous molecules such as NO, O2, and CO play important roles in biological systems ranging from prokaryotes to mammals. In mammals, heme-containing soluble guanylyl cyclase serves a pivotal role for sensing NO (1Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 175-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (2137) Google Scholar) and possibly CO (2Verma A. Hirsch D.J. Glatt C.E. Ronnett G.V. Snyder S.H. Science. 1993; 259: 381-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1376) Google Scholar). Several other sensors respond to O2, including the heme-based FixL and DOS proteins (3Delgado-Nixon V.M. Gonzalez G. Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2685-2691Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 4Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Ditta G.S. Helinski D.R. Nature. 1991; 350: 170-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). These sensors use heme prosthetic groups to perceive the presence of different small molecules, but they show relatively less selectivity than does CooA 1The abbreviation used is: CooA, the CO-oxidation activator protein from R. rubrum. (5Jain R. Chan M.K. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2003; 8: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). For example, hemoglobin is poised to discriminate against CO, but CO is still a potent inhibitor of O2 transport. Although FixL shows significant discrimination for O2 by some in vitro assays, it does respond to a variety of small molecules to some detectable extent (6Dunham C.M. Dioum E.M. Tuckerman J.R. Gonzalez G. Scott W.G. Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7701-7708Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In contrast, CooA, the CO-oxidation activator protein from Rhodospirillum rubrum, is highly selective toward CO and fails to respond detectably to other small molecules (7Reynolds M.F. Parks R.B. Burstyn J.N. Shelver D. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. Vogel K.M. Spiro T.G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 388-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 8Youn H. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2333-2340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). CooA is a heme-containing homodimeric transcriptional regulator that activates the genes required for the oxidation of CO only when CO binds to its heme groups (9Kerby R.L. Ludden P.W. Roberts G.P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2241-2244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10He Y. Shelver D. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. J. Biol.

Biol. 2001; 67: 35-63Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CooA exists in at least two general conformations: in the active conformation, the DNA-binding domains are positioned to allow the F helices to contact specific DNA targets, but in inactive conformations, these DNA-binding domains are positioned substantially differently (11Roberts G.P. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Lanzilotta W.N. Poulos T.L. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 67: 35-63Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although these two conformations exist in equilibrium, CO binding, which displaces a subunit-swapped N-terminal Pro2 ligand (12Yamamoto K. Ishikawa H. Takahashi S. Ishimori K. Morishima I. Nakajima H. Aono S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11473-11476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), causes a shift in that equilibrium toward the active form. Structural analysis and additional experimentation have shown that the signal transduction mechanism between the CO-bound heme and the DNA-binding domains involves the repositioning about the C helices at the dimer interface (13Lanzilotta W.N. Schuller D.J. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 14Kerby R.L. Youn H. Thorsteinsson M.V. Roberts G.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 809-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Importantly, a portion of these C helices also forms the distal heme pocket of CooA (Fig. 1). In the CO-bound form, the C-helix residues Ile113, Leu116, and Gly117 have been identified to be near the bound CO by resonance Raman analysis (15Coyle C.M. Puranik M. Youn H. Nielsen S.B. Williams R.D. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. Spiro T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35384-35393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and the roles of these residues in CooA function in response to CO have been evaluated (8Youn H. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2333-2340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 16Youn H. Kerby R.L. Thorsteinsson M.V. Conrad M. Staples C.R. Serate J. Beack J. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41603-41610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, the active form of CooA has not been solved structurally and therefore the molecular basis of CO specificity is unknown. It has been shown that hydrophobicity along this region of the C helices is important for activity, leading to the notion that CO binding displaces the N terminus, which in turn exposes a hydrophobic surface of the C helices. This might provide the driving force for repositioning these C helices (8Youn H. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2333-2340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). A central problem in understanding CooA function is therefore to explain the extreme CO specificity in terms of the mechanism that repositions the C helices. In other words, by what mechanism does the exclusive binding of CO to CooA stimulate this repositioning? To better understand this process, we sought to perturb that selectivity by identifying CooA variants that functionally recognized another ligand. We used structural and spectroscopic information to identify residues near the bound CO, simultaneously randomized those residues to obtain a library of altered proteins, and then carried out a biological screen for CooA variants that respond to imidazole, a small molecule to which wild-type CooA is completely unresponsive. The subsequent biochemical characterization of these variants has revealed the basis of the response to imidazole and has important implications for the selectivity and responsiveness of wild-type CooA to CO. Strains and Plasmids—The construction of strains overexpressing wild-type CooA and CooA variants in an Escherichia coli background having a β-galactosidase reporter system in the chromosome was described previously (17Shelver D. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Chung S.Y. Roberts G.P. Reynolds M.F. Parks R.B. Burstyn J.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2669-2678Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). CooA variants were constructed in a pEXT20-based expression plasmid that provides tight control of cooA expression (18Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Conrad M. Youn H. Staples C.R. Lanzilotta W.N. Poulos T.L. Serate J. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39332-39338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Creation and Screening of cooA Mutations—Site-directed mutagenesis involved PCR amplification of cooA with primers designed to incorporate the desired nucleotide change, as described elsewhere (18Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Conrad M. Youn H. Staples C.R. Lanzilotta W.N. Poulos T.L. Serate J. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39332-39338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The method used for codon randomization was essentially identical to the method used for site-directed mutagenesis, except that the primers contained randomized codons for targeted positions of cooA. CooA variants were screened for their ability to cause β-galactosidase accumulation in colonies incubated under different growth conditions as described previously (18Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Conrad M. Youn H. Staples C.R. Lanzilotta W.N. Poulos T.L. Serate J. Roberts G.P. J. Biol.

CooA variants were chosen based on colony color, and β-galactosidase activity was then determined quantitatively in liquid culture (18Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Conrad M. Youn H. Staples C.R.

For biochemical characterization, wild-type, ΔP3R4 (lacking Pro3 and Arg4) and selected imidazole-responsive CooA variants were his-tagged at the C terminus, expressed with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and purified as described below. Purification of His-tagged Wild-type CooA and CooA Variants—The His-tagged wild-type CooA and CooA variants were purified with a Novagen nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column. Although the purity was >95% after that step, we carried out an additional hydroxylapatite column to completely remove imidazole, then precipitated the purified proteins with a final concentration of 42.5% ammonium sulfate, and stored the proteins at –80 °C. The heme content and extinction coefficient of CooA of each preparation were calculated using an extinction coefficient of 34.4 mm–1 cm–1 at 557 nm for the pyridine hemochrome (19Waterman M.R. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 52: 456-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Production of Imidazole-, CO-, NO-, and CN–-bound Forms—Imidazole-, 1-methylimidazole-, 4-methylimidazole-, CN–-, and CO-bound Fe(II) forms of various CooA proteins were generated by aerobic addition of each effector (50 mm KCN, 50 mm imidazole and its derivatives, and 20% CO (v/v)), followed by anaerobic addition of sodium dithionite to 2mm. As stock solutions, 2.5 m imidazole, and its derivatives, and 2.5 m KCN were freshly prepared in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.5 m KCl. The pH of the imidazole stock solution was re-adjusted to pH 8. For the production of NO-bound Fe(II) CooA, cuvettes or tubes (which were used for fluorescence polarization measurements) containing the Fe(III) forms were thoroughly degassed, 20% NO (v/v) gas was added, and then sodium dithionite was added to 2 mm. Imidazole, 1-methylimidazole, 2-methylimidazole, 4-methylimidazole, KCN, and sodium dithionite were purchased from Sigma or Aldrich. UV-visible Absorption Spectroscopy—UV-visible absorption spectroscopy of CooA samples was performed at room temperature in quartz cuvettes using a Shimadzu UV-2401PC spectrophotometer.

In Vivo Activity Assays and in Vitro DNA-binding Assays—In vivo activities of wild-type CooA and CooA variants were measured using an E. coli strain containing a chromosomally encoded β-galactosidase reporter system (18Thorsteinsson M.V.

In vitro DNA-binding assays of CooA were performed by fluorescence polarization measured with a Beacon 2000 fluorescence polarization detector (PanVera Corp., Madison, WI) as described previously (18Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Conrad M. Youn H. Staples C.R. Lanzilotta W.N. Poulos T.L. Serate J. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39332-39338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The binding mixture contained 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 6 mm CaCl2, 50 mm KCl, 5% glycerol (v/v), and 5 mm dithiothreitol. As a fluorescence probe, a 26-bp target DNA (pCooF) was labeled with Texas Red on one end of the duplex and used at the concentration of 6.4 nm. Salmon sperm DNA at 6.4 μm was included in the reaction mixture to eliminate possible nonspecific DNA binding. Dissociation constants (Kd) were calculated by fitting the binding data to an equation that corrected fluorescence quenching as described elsewhere (21Lundblad J.R. Laurance M. Goodman R.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 607-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). In Vivo Screening and Identification of Novel Imidazole-responsive CooA Variants—To better understand the specificity and response of wild-type CooA to CO, we sought CooA variants that could respond to a completely different effector, imidazole. We reasoned that a comparison of the similarities and differences between wild-type CooA and such variants would clarify the recognition processes in each. Imidazole cannot bind to wild-type CooA, because it is unable to displace either heme ligand. In seeking imidazole-responsive variants, we therefore started with ΔP3R4 CooA in which the codons for Pro3 and Arg4 have been deleted (8Youn H. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2333-2340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This weakens the Pro2 ligand and therefore allows the binding of imidazole to the same side of the heme as is bound by CO when activating wild-type CooA. This variant is still not activated in response to imidazole binding (Ref. 8Youn H. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2333-2340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar and see below), which demonstrates that there is another level of ligand selectivity in CooA. In the ΔP3R4 CooA background, we altered residues known to be near the bound CO in wild-type CooA (15Coyle C.M. Puranik M. Youn H. Nielsen S.B. Williams R.D. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. Spiro T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35384-35393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) in the expectation that different residues might support a responsiveness to imidazole. We simultaneously randomized the codons for residues 113 and 116 and separately randomized the codons for positions 117 and 120 as well. E. coli cultures with libraries of mutagenized cooA alleles were screened for those that produced active CooA in the anaerobic presence of imidazole, based on detection of CooA-dependent β-galactosidase activity. Randomized libraries of positions 117 and 120 gave no positive clones, but at positions 113/116, ∼2.5% of the 6400 colonies displayed intense blue color. After eliminating effector-independent variants, the cooA genes of selected clones were sequenced. Twelve sequenced non-identical imidazole-responsive CooA variants (termed “Blue” in Table I) displayed a range of responses to imidazole in a quantitative in vivo β-galactosidase assay, whereas wild-type and ΔP3R4 CooA showed no response (Table I). The imidazole-responsive CooA variants also responded to CO to varying degrees. The striking pattern among imidazole-responsive CooA variants with high activity is the presence of a Trp residue at either position 113 or 116, although a Trp residue at position 116 tended to severely perturb CO-responsive activity (Table I). In addition to the requirement for a Trp residue, there are obviously effects of the other residues as well: half of the Blue variants possess Trp at position 113, but show an imidazole response of 5.7–117%, depending on the residue at position 116. These differences presumably reflect effects on in vivo activity such as the accumulation level of heme-containing CooA proteins, their affinity for imidazole, their interactions with an RNA polymerase, and the degree to which imidazole binding stimulates the equilibrium shift to the active form. In fact, lowering the external imidazole concentration by 2.5-fold decreased the activities of imidazole-responsive variants, suggesting that even 25 mm imidazole in the growth medium may not be a saturating condition (data not shown). Nonetheless, some CooA variants, such as Blue-1 (ΔP3R4/Arg113/Trp116) and Blue-4 (ΔP3R4/Trp113/Trp116), displayed much higher activity with imidazole than with CO in vivo (Table I). The in vitro quantification of the dramatic alteration in ligand specificity is described below. The efficacy of Trp residues, compared with that of Phe and Tyr, suggests that its particular geometry is important.Table ISelected imidazole-responsive CooA variants obtained by randomization of both 113 and 116 residues in the ΔP3R4 backgroundCooASequenceβ-Galactosidase activityaPercent activity indicates the mean value of multiple measurements of activity relative to that of wild-type CooA cultivated in the presence of CO and showed variability of <10% and <20% with the effectors CO and imidazole, respectively. 100% activity corresponds to 46.2 Miller units.

Open table in a new tab Binding of Imidazole to the Heme Affords DNA Binding in Selected Imidazole-responsive CooA Variants—To show that the imidazole-responsive activity in vivo correlates with the transition of CooA to the DNA-binding form, we carried out in vitro biochemical analysis with purified imidazole-responsive variants. For this analysis, selected imidazole-responsive variants, together with wild-type and ΔP3R4 CooA, were His-tagged and purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 2A, all the tested CooA variants, including ΔP3R4 CooA, had a significant population of five-coordinate species in their Fe(II) forms, as indicated by the elevated ϵFe(II)+CO/ϵFe(II) ratio of Soret maxima, which range from 1.08 for wild-type CooA to more than 1.7 for several variants (see “ϵFe(II)+CO/ϵFe(II)” column in Table II). Based on the titration of imidazole binding, all CooA variants were saturated in the presence of 50 mm imidazole, and their spectra appear to be fully of six coordinates (Fig. 2A; see also the “ϵFe(II)+CO/ϵFe(II)+Imi” column in Table II). We assume that imidazole binds to the five-coordinate species created by the weakened Pro2 ligation and shifts the equilibrium to the six-coordinate imidazole adducts. The approximate Kd values for imidazole binding to the Fe(II) forms of the variants ranged from 0.1 to 5 mm (data not shown). These affinities are within an order of magnitude of the imidazole affinity of N-terminal-acetylated microperoxidase-8, whose Fe(II) form is known to be five coordinate (22Tezcan F.A. Winkler J.R. Gray H.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 13383-13388Crossref Scopus (263) Google Scholar), consistent with the model for imidazole binding by these CooA variants.Table IIComparison among the electronic absorption spectral parameters of various imidazole-responsive CooA variants along with those of wild-type, ΔP3R4, and G117I CooA proteinsCooASequenceMaximum (nm) and ϵ (mm-1 cm-1) of Soret bandRatio of Soret ϵ113116Fe(II)Fe(II)+Imia50 mm imidazole was used.Fe(II)+COb20% CO (v/v) was used.Fe(II)+Imi/Fe(II)Fe(II)+CO/Fe(II)Fe(II)+CO/Fe(II)+ImiFe(II) form coordinationnmϵnmϵnmϵWild-typeIleLeu423.5218425.0218422.02361.001.081.086-CoordinatecRef. 25.ΔP3R4IleLeu424.5155425.5214422.52271.381.461.06Blue-1ArgTrp426.0150426.5208421.52221.391.481.07Blue-2TrpPhe425.0124426.5209423.02181.691.761.04Blue-4TrpTrp425.5126427.0199423.02161.581.711.09Blue-7LysTrp425.0173426.5204422.02151.181.241.05Blue-9TrpLeu424.5144426.0201422.52251.401.561.12Blue-12IleTrp425.5120426.5192423.02121.601.771.10G117I426.0NAdNA, not available.NANA422.0NANA1.78eRef. 16.NA5-CoordinatefRef. 15.a 50 mm imidazole was used.b 20% CO (v/v) was used.c Ref. 25Shelver D.

Open table in a new tab These variants were still able to bind CO and the UV-visible spectra of the CO-bound forms were similar to each other and to that of wild-type CO-bound CooA, with minor variations (Fig. 2A and Table II). This suggests that there is not a dramatic effect on the local heme environment in these forms. When CO was added to the imidazole adducts of the above CooA variants, the spectra of the resultant forms were indistinguishable from their CO-bound forms in the absence of imidazole (data not shown), indicating that CO can completely displace the imidazole ligand under these conditions. DNA-binding abilities of the proteins were then measured using the method of fluorescence polarization to quantify the effectiveness of imidazole in inducing the active conformation. Fig. 2B shows the titration of selected imidazole-responsive variants to target DNA under three conditions: no effector, 50 mm imidazole, and 20% CO (v/v). Although the selected imidazole-responsive variants differ in the degree of imidazole responsiveness, they are all dramatically better than wild-type or ΔP3R4 CooA, which showed no DNA binding in response to imidazole up to 1 μm protein (Fig. 2B and Table III). In response to CO, all these variants showed poorer DNA binding than did wild type CooA, and a Trp at position 116 was particularly detrimental (Fig. 2B and Table III), consistent with the in vivo data (Table I) and previous results (8Youn H. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2333-2340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Importantly, however, some of the variants were significantly poorer at responding to CO than to imidazole. Similar results were seen when CO was added to the pre-existing imidazole adducts of these variants (data not shown). In the absence of any effector, none of the variants had significant DNA-binding activity (Fig. 2B).Table IIIDNA-binding parameters and change of ligand specificity in selected imidazole-responsive CooA variantsCooASequenceDissociation constant (Kd) for DNA bindingRatio of KdChange of specificityaChange of specificity was calculated by dividing the ratio of Kd values for wild-type CooA by that for each variant.nMKd(+Imi)/Kd(+CO)-fold113116None+Imib50 mm imidazole was used for the assay.+COc20% CO (v/v) was used for the assay.Wild-typeIleLeu>5000>500028>1791ΔP3R4IleLeu>5000>500043>116∼1.5Blue-1ArgTrp>500058∼12000.05>3580Blue-2TrpPhe>50001194240.28>639Blue-4TrpTrp>5000404∼19000.21>852Blue-7LysTrp>5000329∼11000.30>597Blue-9TrpLeu>50006364514>13Blue-12IleTrp>5000∼960∼16000.60>298a Change of specificity was calculated by dividing the ratio of Kd values for wild-type CooA by that for each variant.b 50 mm imidazole was used for the assay.c 20% CO (v/v) was used for the assay. Open table in a new tab Table III summarizes DNA-binding characteristics of these variants in response to either imidazole or CO and compares their ligand responsiveness with that of wild-type CooA. ΔP3R4/Arg113/Trp116 CooA displayed the best DNA affinity in response to imidazole, as well as the greatest change in ligand specificity, where it showed a change of specificity of ∼3000-fold relative to wild-type CooA (Table III). Taken together, these results strongly argue that imidazole ligation to the heme iron initiates the activation of these variants. It is also clear that the effector specificity has not merely been expanded, but rather has been dramatically altered, such that some variants respond better to imidazole than to CO. As explained in the introduction, the ability of these proteins to bind DNA results from a repositioning of the DNA-binding domains, which in wild-type CooA involves movement of the C helices. Because the residue changes in these variants lie far from the DNA-binding domains themselves, it is highly likely that they also reposition their C helices in the course of becoming active, rather than create a completely different signal pathway. It is therefore interesting that there is no clear correlation between imidazole responsiveness and CO responsiveness among these variants. This result implies that these variants sense the two effectors by rather different specific mechanisms. It is also apparent that the major contribution to the change of ligand specificity is from increased DNA-binding ability in response to imidazole, rather than from perturbed DNA-binding ability in response to CO. The Variants Differentially Recognize Imidazole and Its Derivatives—To understand the basis for the conformational change induced by imidazole in these variants, we tested the response of three variants (ΔP3R4/Trp113/Leu116, ΔP3R4/Trp113/Phe116, and ΔP3R4/Arg113/Trp116) to three imidazole derivatives: 1-, 2-, and 4-methylimidazole. As indicated by UV-visible spectra (Fig. 3A), 1- and 4-methylimidazole bound to the hemes at the tested level of 50 mm. 2-Methylimidazole did not bind as a heme ligand but perturbed the heme stability of the protein by an unknown mechanism. Neither 1- nor 4-methylimidazole perturbed the DNA-binding activity of CO-bound wild-type CooA at the tested level of 50 mm (data not shown), so any effect on the DNA-binding activities of the variants must be from the ligation property of these two molecules. At the saturating concentration (50 mm each) for heme ligation, imidazole and these two derivatives produced meaningfully different responses with the variants in terms of DNA binding (Fig. 3B). In the case of ΔP3R4/Arg113/Trp116, imidazole was far more effective than the two derivatives. In the case of ΔP3R4/Trp113/Phe116, imidazole was more effective than 4-methylimidazole, which was itself more effec"
