https://openalex.org/W2054113812,Budgerygahs (Melopsittacus undulatus) flew with a minimum oxygen consumption of 38 milliliters per gramhour at each of three speeds between 19 and 33 kilometers per hour in a recirculating wind tunnel. An oxygen debt accumulated in the first minute of flight and was repaid in the minute following cessation of flight. Frequency of wingbeat was independent of flight speed. The data suggest that flying budgerygahs have a higher cardiac output per kilogram of body weight than mammals and that flight muscle of the budgerygah is among the most metabolically active tissues known.

A gas-solid capillary and several packed columns were used. The onset of turbulence was associated with abrupt decrease in peak width in the capillary and gradual leveling off and decrease in the Packed width in the existence of separation under turbulent conditions was shown. The Potential of the method was demonstrated by its short elution times and generation of theoretical Plates."

Experiments to determine reader preference and acceptance of the device are presented, and performance criteria on the device are listed."

https://openalex.org/W2010051512,"The ""nacreous"" luster characteristic of the pholidostrophiid group of fossil brachiopods results from a shell structure that produces superimposed sets of natural optical-diffraction gratings made of calcite. The wall structure is crossed lamellar, parallel to the shell surfdce; thus flakiness and development of reflecting surfaces are facilitated."

https://openalex.org/W1965392251,"It appears possible to extend the application of most of the existing detection techniques to the identification and separation of charged particles in the relativistic energy region. One can probably extend these applications, in certain limited cases, up to an energy region of several hundred billion electron volts. However, for general applications in the identification of particles in the ultrarelativistic region, the existing detectors are rather limited, and new methods and approaches are desirable. At present, detectors making use of the relativistic rise effect seem to show considerable promise."
