https://openalex.org/W1605002548,"Iron and iron compounds may facilitate hydroxyl-radical generation from activated oxygen species. Earlier work on the generation of this radical has been focused on simple, low-molecular-weight iron compounds. We hypothesized that free hemoglobin, like other iron-rich substances, might also mediate hydroxyl-radical generation. We find: 1) In the presence of a superoxide anion-generating system (hypoxanthine and xanthine oxidase), hemoglobin promotes hydroxyl-radical formation in a dose-dependent fashion. 2) This generation of hydroxyl radical is greatly decreased by prior oxidation of the hemoglobin, equilibration of hemoglobin with carbon monoxide, or addition of catalase, while added superoxide dismutase has little effect. Therefore, hydroxyl radical probably arises primarily via reaction between the ferrous heme iron and H2O2. 3) In further support of this, hydroxyl radical forms as readily upon the addition of H2O2 to hemoglobin. 4) Hemoglobin also increases hypoxanthine/xanthine oxidase-driven peroxidation of poly-unsaturated fatty acids such as arachidonic acid and human red cell membrane lipids. 5) The addition of sufficient haptoglobin (the plasma hemoglobin-binding protein) suppresses both hemoglobin-driven hydroxyl radical and malondialdehyde generation. Thus, free hemoglobin may be biologically hazardous, in part because it acts as a Fenton reagent, having the potential to catalyze hydroxyl-radical generation in areas of inflammation. Haptoglobin, which binds hemoglobin very tightly, blocks this through a presently unknown mechanism. An important physiologic function of haptoglobin may be prevention of such hemoglobin-mediated oxidation."
https://openalex.org/W2042464607,"The cells of a cold-sensitive mutant nda3-KM311 of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe were arrested highly synchronously at a step similar to mitotic prophase when incubated at a restrictive temperature. DAPI staining and indirect immunofluorescence microscopy showed three condensed chromosomes but no spindle. Six minutes after the temperature shifted to a permissive one, the spindle appeared and elongated. The chromosomes were separated at a constant speed (relative velocity 1 micron/min), and the spindle disappeared after the chromosomes reached opposite ends of the cell. The NDA3 gene of S. pombe was cloned by transformation. The 2.6 kb Hind III genomic DNA that complemented the nda3 mutations had only one coding frame split with five short introns. The predicted amino acid sequence contained 448 residues, and was 75% homologous to that of chicken beta-tubulin."
https://openalex.org/W2060426330,"Treatment of guinea pig neutrophils with pertussis toxin (islet-activating protein; IAP) results in inhibition of N-formyl peptide receptor-mediated release of arachidonic acid and granular enzymes. Inhibition by the toxin is specific, in that responses to the calcium ionophore A23187 are not affected. The action of the toxin is not associated with alterations in cellular concentrations of cyclic AMP but is correlated with the ability of the toxin to catalyze the ADP-ribosylation of a 41,000 dalton membrane protein. This protein comigrates on SDS-polyacrylamide gels with the alpha subunit of Gi, the inhibitory guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory component of adenylate cyclase. It is likely that this G protein is involved in receptor-mediated signal transduction in neutrophils by mechanisms that do not involve cyclic AMP."
https://openalex.org/W2049645388,"Heteroduplex analysis shows that the transferrin receptor gene contains at least 19 distinct coding sequences distributed over 31 kb of genomic DNA. The nucleotide sequence of these coding regions has been determined from a cDNA clone. The sequence contains a single complete open reading frame of 2280 bases which specifies a 760 residue polypeptide with a molecular weight of 85K daltons. The deduced amino acid sequence of the receptor shows that it does not contain an N-terminal hydrophobic signal peptide. We have found a single region of sufficient length and hydrophobicity to span the membrane, located 61 amino acids from the N-terminus. This leads to the prediction that the receptor is oriented in the membrane with a cytoplasmic N-terminus and an extracellular C-terminus. The receptor has no significant homology with transferrin, or with any receptor for which a sequence is available."

Molecular cloning of DNA sequences encompassing the per+ locus has allowed germ-line transformation experiments to be carried out. Certain subsegments of the per region, transduced into the genome of arrhythmic pero flies, restore rhythmicity in circadian locomotor behavior and the male's courtship song."
https://openalex.org/W1977839031,"Special mechanisms for stimulating recombination among the nearly identical repeat units of certain multigene families may exist in order to maintain their sequence homogeneity. We have found evidence for such a recombination-stimulating activity in the tandemly repeated ribosomal RNA genes of yeast. A fragment of the yeast ribosomal DNA (rDNA), containing the 5S gene, nontranscribed spacer DNA, and part of the 25S gene, causes a localized stimulation of recombination when inserted at novel locations in the yeast genome. The rDNA fragment stimulates both interchromosomal and intrachromosomal mitotic recombination but not meiotic recombination. To stimulate mitotic recombination, the fragment must act on both copies of the recombining gene. Furthermore, the rDNA fragment stimulates exchange only when inserted with the 5S gene proximal to, and the 25S gene distal to, the recombining alleles."
https://openalex.org/W1998374399,"Albinism in plants regenerated from pollen by anther culture may result from the same mechanisms as postulated to be responsible for maternal inheritance of chloroplasts. Consistent with this view, Southern blotting was used to show that large regions of the chloroplast genome (over 80% in one case) were deleted in the major ctDNA molecules present in eight albino wheat plants regenerated from separate pollen calluses. A wide variety of deleted ctDNA molecules was present in these plants. Most albino plants appeared to contain a heterogeneous population of ctDNA molecules. Albino plant 6 contained one major type of deleted ctDNA molecule that had a circular 39 kb restriction map. The retention of only two Pst l (unaltered in size) fragments in albino plant 7 may delimit a region of ctDNA that contains a replication origin."
https://openalex.org/W2171017866,"The Mu A protein binds site-specifically to the ends of Mu DNA. Two blocks of protection against nuclease are seen at the left (L) end; the right (R) end exhibits one continuous block of protection. We interpret the nuclease protection pattern and sequence data as evidence for three Mu A protein binding sites at each end of Mu. Both the L and R ends have one site close to the terminus; each end also has two additional sites that differ in location between the L and R ends. The Mu A protein protection patterns on the L ends of Mu and the closely related phage D108 are, despite many interspersed sequence differences in one of the protected regions, essentially identical. We show that the A proteins of Mu and D108 can function, at different efficiencies, interchangeably on the Mu and D108 L ends in vivo. Purified Mu repressor, in addition to its primary binding in the operator region, also binds less strongly to the Mu ends at the same sites as the Mu A protein. This affinity of Mu repressor for DNA sites recognized by the Mu A protein may play a role as a second level of control of transposition by the repressor."
https://openalex.org/W1573850071,The rat proenkephalin gene has been isolated by molecular cloning and characterized by DNA-sequence analysis. The gene exhibits a structural organization similar to that of the human gene. The nucleotide sequence encoding the biologically active opioid peptides which are generated from the proenkephalin precursor as well as the 3' untranslated region of the mRNA are found on a large exon at the 3' end of the gene (Exon III). The nucleotide sequence encoding the N terminus of the mature protein and its signal peptide are located on Exon II while Exon I encodes the 5' untranslated region of the mRNA. The nucleotide sequence of these exons and their flanking regions has been determined and compared to the human proenkephalin gene. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence homology between the human and rat proenkephalin gene reveals the presence of highly conserved regions within both the coding and noncoding portions of the genes. Enkephalin-coding sequences as well as 5' flanking sequences appear to be the most highly conserved. The importance and possible function of these sequences are discussed.
https://openalex.org/W1584635729,"Glucagon, a peptide of 29 amino acids that is produced and secreted by the pancreas, is a regulator of carbohydrate and protein metabolism. Recently, we determined the nucleotide sequence of a mRNA of 1300 nucleotides that encodes rat pre-proglucagon, a polyprotein precursor of glucagon. The polyprotein contains the sequences of glucagon and two glucagon-like peptides arranged in tandem and separated by intervening peptides. Now we report the structure of the gene encoding rat pre-proglucagon. The unique transcriptional unit of the gene spans 10 kilobase pairs and consists of six exons and five introns. Four of the six exons encode distinct functional domains of the pre-proglucagon. The signal sequence, glucagon, and two glucagon-like sequences arranged in tandem are each encoded by a separate exon. A promoter sequence TA-TAAA is located 26 base pairs upstream from the mRNA cap site, and two polyadenylation signals AA-TAAA are present in the 3' untranslated region of the encoded mRNA. The 3' flanking region of the gene contains repetitive sequence DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1480240085,"A family of approximately 10 trypsin genes was detected in a rat genomic library by hybridization and in vivo recombination techniques using cloned rat pancreatic trypsin I and II cDNAs as probes. Two separate clones containing the entire trypsin I gene and most of the trypsin II gene were sequenced. Four introns split the trypsin I coding sequence. The positions of the first three introns of the trypsin II gene are identical with those in the trypsin I gene (the fourth intron was not present in the trypsin II clone). The coding regions of the two genes are 88% homologous; the 5'-noncoding regions are 92% homologous, whereas the 3'-noncoding regions share 66% identity. In contrast, the proximal 5'-flanking regions from -1 to -500 which may contain the elements controlling gene expression are less than 30% conserved overall, but segments of approximately 70% homology can be discerned in this region. Some of these sequences are homologous to sequences found in the chymotrypsin and elastase genes. More distal upstream sequences (-500 to -2500) and the intervening sequences show no evident sequence homology (less than 20%). Unique sequences containing homopolymeric purine/pyrimidine repeats are found 2.5 kilobases upstream from the start of transcription of the trypsin I gene and within the second and third introns of the trypsin II gene. The nucleotide homologies as well as the similarities of intron positions of the two trypsin genes to those of other serine protease genes clearly support an evolutionary relationship between members of this gene family."
https://openalex.org/W1585720578,"Epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor protein has been purified in a single high-yield step by immunoaffinity chromatography of extracts of A431 cells. A monoclonal antibody directed against the EGF binding site of the receptor was immobilized to Sepharose 4B as a specific immune absorbent and competitive elution with EGF was used to obtain purified EGF receptor protein with tyrosine kinase activity. The stoichiometry of EGF binding was determined by comparing 125I-EGF binding to A431 cells with the mass of EGF receptor protein in those cells as measured by immunoaffinity chromatography, radioimmunoassay, and immune precipitation. Each measurement indicated one EGF binding site/EGF receptor protein molecule. Study of the kinetics of autophosphorylation revealed rapid incorporation of 1 mol of phosphate/mol of enzyme followed by slower incorporation of additional phosphate groups. The autophosphorylation reaction has a Km for ATP (0.2 microM) which is about 10-fold lower than that for phosphorylation of exogenous substrates. The kinetically preferred autophosphorylation is an intramolecular reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1578537067,"Beef heart aconitase, as isolated under aerobic conditions, is inactive and contains a [3Fe-4S]1+ cluster. On incubation at pH greater than 9.5 (or treatment with 4-8 M urea) the color of the protein changes from brown to purple. This purple form is stable and can be converted back in good yield to the active [4Fe-4S]2+ form by reduction in the presence of iron. Active aconitase is converted to the purple form at alkaline pH only after oxidative inactivation. The Fe/S2- ratio of purple aconitase is 0.8, indicating the presence of [3Fe-4S] clusters. The number of SH groups readily reacting with 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) is increased from approximately 1 in the enzyme as isolated to 7-8 in the purple form, indicating a partial unfolding of the protein. On conversion of inactive aconitase to the purple form, the EPR signal at g = 2.01 (S = 1/2) is replaced by signals at g = 4.3 and 9.6 (S = 5/2). Mossbauer spectroscopy shows that purple aconitase has high-spin ferric ions, each residing in a tetrahedral environment of sulfur atoms. The three iron sites are exchange-coupled to yield a ground state with S = 5/2. Analysis of the data within a spin coupling model shows that J13 congruent to J23 and 2 J12 less than J13, where the Jik describe the antiferromagnetic (J greater than 0) exchange interactions among the three iron pairs. Comparison of our data with those reported for synthetic Fe-S clusters (Hagen, K. S., Watson, A. D., and Holm, R. H., (1983) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 105, 3905-3913) shows that purple aconitase contains a linear [3Fe-4S]1+ cluster, a structural isomer of the S = 1/2 cluster of inactive aconitase. Our studies also show that protein-bound [2Fe-2S] clusters can be generated under conditions where partial unfolding of the protein occurs."
https://openalex.org/W1602013545,"We have studied the ATPase activity of DNA gyrase both in the absence and presence of DNA. In the absence of DNA we show that the gyrase B protein alone has a very low level of ATPase activity which can be increased many-fold by pretreatment of the B protein with heat or urea. When both the gyrase A protein and linear DNA are also present, the ATPase activity of the untreated B protein is greatly stimulated. We find that the extent of stimulation is dependent upon the length of the DNA but largely independent of DNA sequence. DNA molecules greater than 100 base pairs in length are much more effective in stimulating the gyrase ATPase than those of 70 base pairs or less, although short DNA molecules will stimulate the ATPase at high concentrations. The behavior of long and short DNA molecules with respect to ATPase stimulation is also reflected in their abilities to bind DNA gyrase. To account for these data we propose a model for the interaction of gyrase with ATP and DNA in which ATP hydrolysis requires the binding of DNA to two sites on the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1540784621,"A 110-kDa protein present in chicken intestinal brush-border microvilli is believed to laterally link the actin filament bundle that forms the structural core of the microvilli with the microvillar plasma membrane. We have purified a 110-kDa protein to greater than 95% homogeneity by extraction of brush borders with solution containing 0.6 M KCl and 5 mM ATP, followed by gel filtration chromatography, sedimentation as a complex with exogenous actin, and hydroxylapatite chromatography. The 110-kDa protein-calmodulin complex bound F-actin in the absence but not the presence of ATP and had K+,EDTA-ATPase (0.2 mumol/min/mg) and Ca2+-ATPase (0.2 mumol/min/mg) activities and Mg2+-ATPase activity (0.03 mumol/min/mg) that was not activated by F-actin. The actin-binding and ATPase activities of the complex were similar to those of purified brush-border myosin. However, immunoblot analysis showed no reactivity between the 110-kDa protein and polyclonal antibody against purified chicken brush-border myosin. Also, peptide maps of 110-kDa protein and myosin obtained by limited proteolysis with chymotrypsin and Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease had few, if any, peptides in common. Immunoblot analysis also showed that myosin heavy chain was stable under the conditions of the preparation."
https://openalex.org/W1531185348,"Apolipoprotein (apo) E-deficient rat high-density lipoproteins (HDL) bind to isolated rat hepatocytes at 4 degrees C by a process shown to be saturable and competed for by an excess of unlabeled HDL. Uptake (binding and internalization) at 37 degrees C was also saturable and competed for by an excess of unlabeled HDL. At 37 degrees C the HDL apoprotein was degraded as evidenced by the appearance of trichloroacetic acid-soluble radioactivity in the incubation media. The binding of a constant amount of 125I-apo-E-deficient HDL was measured in the presence of increasing concentrations of various lipoproteins. HDL and dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine (DMPC) X apo-A-I complexes decreased binding by 80 and 65%, respectively. Human low-density lipoproteins, DMPC X apo-E complexes, and DMPC vesicles alone did not compete for apo-E-deficient HDL binding. However, DMPC X apo-E complexes did compete for the binding of the total HDL fraction that contained apo-E but to a lesser extent than did DMPC X apo-A-I. DMPC X 125I-apo-A-I complexes also bound to hepatocytes, and this binding was competed for by excess HDL (70%) and DMPC X apo-A-I complexes (65%), but there was no competition for binding by DMPC vesicles or DMPC X apo-E complexes. It thus appears that hepatocytes have a specific receptor for HDL and that apo-A-I is the ligand for this receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1536988058,"We have isolated and characterized rat genomic DNA fragments bearing the two secretory elastase genes that are expressed in the exocrine pancreas. The complete exonic sequences for each of the genes as well as considerable intronic and flanking sequences are reported. Each elastase gene is interrupted by seven intervening sequences which are located at corresponding positions within the two genes, with one exception: the third intron of the elastase II gene has shifted one codon in the 5' direction. The placement of introns within the amino acid coding domains in part may reflect the formation of the progenitor serine protease gene by the duplication of an exon encoding a characteristic polypeptide structure comprising three beta sheets. The activation peptides of the zymogens and the signal peptides, which form discrete functional domains in the protein precursors, are encoded by separate exons. In addition to the TATAA box, the two genes share considerable sequence similarity in the 5'-proximal flanking regions (up to approximately 450 base pairs upstream); however, a number of gaps must be introduced to optimize the sequence alignment. The similarities are largely confined to six oligonucleotide regions with greater than 70% sequence conservation. The elastase I gene has a perfect repeating copolymer (GT)24 located 427-379 nucleotides upstream from the start of transcription. The elastase II gene has a similar GT-rich region (52/55 G or T) located 384-330 nucleotides upstream. Comparison of the 5'-flanking regions of the two elastase genes with those of pancreatic chymotrypsin and trypsin I and II reveals that one of the six conserved oligonucleotide regions is generally conserved for these genes as well. This conserved region contains putative enhancer core sequences."
https://openalex.org/W1564677921,"We have isolated a cDNA clone (pRcol 2) which is complementary to the 5'-terminal portion of the rat pro-alpha 1(II) chain mRNA. A synthetic oligonucleotide was used both as a primer for cDNA synthesis and as a probe for screening a cDNA library. The probe was a mixture of sixteen 14-mers deduced from an amino acid sequence present in the amino-terminal telopeptide of the rat cartilage alpha 1(II) chain. This primer was chosen so that the resulting cDNA would contain the sequence of the 5' end of the mRNA. The nucleotide sequences of the cDNA were determined and compared with that of three other interstitial procollagen chain mRNAs (pro-alpha 1(I), pro-alpha 2(I), and pro-alpha 1(III) chain mRNA). pRcol 2 contains a 521-base pair (bp) insert, including 153 bp of the 5' untranslated region plus 368 bp coding for the signal peptide, the amino-terminal propeptide, and a part of the telopeptide. The signal peptide of the type II collagen chain is composed of about 20 amino acids. There is little homology between the amino acid sequence of the signal peptide in the pro-alpha 1(II) chain and that of three other interstitial procollagen chains. The NH2-terminal propeptide is deduced to contain short nonhelical sequences at its amino and carboxyl ends and an internal helical collagenous domain comprising 25 repeats of Gly-X-Y with one interruption. There is a strong conservation of the amino acid sequence of the carboxyl-terminal part of the NH2-terminal propeptide in the pro-alpha 1(II), pro-alpha 1(I), and pro-alpha 2(I) chains. Type II collagen mRNA does not contain a sequence corresponding to a uniquely conserved nucleotide sequence around the translation initiation site which occurs in mRNA for other procollagen chains."
https://openalex.org/W2167432245,"The DNA sequence of the Escherichia coli metK gene has been determined. Protein sequence data for purified S-adenosylmethionine synthetase have also been obtained and confirm that metK is the structural gene for S-adenosylmethionine synthetase in E. coli. The sequence of the amino-terminal 35 residues of purified S-adenosylmethionine synthetase localizes the beginning of the coding region of the DNA. The open reading frame extends 1152 bases and codes for a 384-residue protein of Mr = 41,941. The gene is transcribed clockwise on the E. coli chromosome. The DNA region 5' to the coding region was found to contain symmetrical sequences suggestive of operator structures and homologous to sequences upstream from other met genes sharing the same regulatory mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1676708789,"When solubilized in laurylmaltoside, cytochrome oxidases from beef heart and rat liver mitochondria exist as monodisperse populations that are stable, highly active, and have apparent molecular weights of 300,000 to 350,000, as measured by gel filtration. To determine whether these are monomeric (2 heme A, 2 Cu) or dimeric forms of the enzyme, we performed radiation inactivation and sedimentation equilibrium analyses. From radiation inactivation experiments under two different sets of conditions, we obtained estimates for the functional molecular weight of beef heart cytochrome oxidase of 114,000 and 99,000, much less than a dimer and significantly smaller than a 200,000 molecular weight monomer containing one copy of each of the 12 subunits normally present in the complex. The same functional size is obtained for a rat liver oxidase preparation depleted of subunit III. The physical molecular weight of cytochrome oxidase was determined by sedimentation equilibrium measurements in solvents of different densities using mixtures of H2O and D218O. Estimates of Mr = 194,000 +/- 9,000 for the beef heart oxidase and Mr = 152,000 +/- 6,000 for the rat liver enzyme were obtained, consistent with the size predicted for monomers of their subunit composition. From these results we conclude that mammalian cytochrome oxidases from beef heart and rat liver exist in laurylmaltoside as monomers capable of high rates of electron transfer and normal substrate binding. Further, these functions appear to be associated with a subset of the peptides present in the monomer, mainly composed of subunits I and II."
https://openalex.org/W1662303298,"Nucleotide sequence of a DNA fragment containing the alkA gene and its control region has been determined using a chemical method. Only one open reading frame responsible for 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase II was found. The hypothetical polypeptide deduced from the DNA sequence, with a molecular weight of 31,400, has an amino-terminal sequence and total amino acid composition identical to that of purified 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase II. We constructed hybrid plasmids carrying an alkA'-lacZ' fusion, with the proper control region for alkA expression. A hybrid polypeptide with beta-galactosidase activity was formed when lac mutant cells harboring such plasmids were incubated with low doses of N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine or methylmethane sulfonate. Other DNA-damaging agents, such as ethylmethane sulfonate, nalidixic acid, and ultraviolet light did not induce the enzyme activity. The induction was controlled by the ada and adc, but not by the recA and lexA genes."
https://openalex.org/W1587806072,"In a previous communication we proposed a reaction scheme to explain our observation that thyroid peroxidase and lactoperoxidase degrade H2O2 catalatically in the presence of low concentrations of iodide. An essential feature of the scheme was the proposal that enzyme-bound hypoiodite, designated [EOI]-, is a common intermediate in various peroxidase-catalyzed reactions involving iodide. In the present investigation, we tested the validity of this scheme by studying the predictions that it makes concerning the formation of OH-, O2, I2, and organically bound iodine. Stoichiometric and kinetic measurements were made to correlate formation of these various products. Three different peroxidase-catalyzed reactions were studied: 1) oxidation of I- to I2; 2) iodide-dependent catalytic degradation of H2O2 to O2; and 3) iodination of tyrosine or thyroglobulin. Reaction 2 was also studied nonenzymatically using I2, for comparison with the enzyme-catalyzed reaction. In all three reactions, both the stoichiometric and kinetic results with thyroid peroxidase agreed closely with the predictions made by the proposed scheme. This was largely the case with lactoperoxidase also. However, in the case of lactoperoxidase-catalyzed iodination of tyrosine or thyroglobulin, we observed a marked discrepancy between initial rates of OH- release and iodination, inconsistent with the mechanism originally proposed for the iodination reaction. As a possible explanation for this kinetic discrepancy, we postulate that lactoperoxidase generates hypoiodous acid and that the latter is the active intermediate in the various reactions involving iodide."
https://openalex.org/W1522192042,"Here, we report the first identification of a sperm receptor for an egg-associated peptide (speract). Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Tyr-Asp-Leu-Asn-Gly-Gly-Gly-Val-Gly (GGG[Y2]-speract), was chemically synthesized and shown to possess equivalent respiration-stimulating activity and the same receptor binding characteristics as speract (Gly-Phe-Asp-Leu-Asn-Gly-Gly-Gly-Val-Gly). The incubation of Strongylocentrotus purpuratus intact sperm cells with radioiodinated GGG[Y2]-speract and the chemical cross-linking reagent, disuccinimidyl suberate, resulted in the appearance of a single radiolabeled band with an estimated Mr = 77,000 (determined by Na dodecyl SO4-gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions). The covalent coupling of 125I-GGG[Y2]-speract was prevented by biologically active analogues of speract but not by inactive analogues and the 125I analogue was not detectably coupled to any protein in Arbacia punctulata spermatozoa, a species with which speract does not cross-react. Comparisons of the amount of 125I-GGG[Y2]-speract bound in the presence of variable concentrations of unlabeled GGG[Y2]-speract showed that about 1 nM unlabeled peptide reduced 125I-GGG[Y2]-speract binding by 50% when estimated as either specific binding to intact cells or as the reduction in radioactivity found in the 77,000 molecular-weight band on autoradiographs after covalent coupling. The radiolabeled receptor could be solubilized with 0.5% Lubrol PX and was bound to wheat germ lectin-Sepharose. It could be subsequently eluted with N-acetylglucosamine or diacetylchitotriose but not by methyl-alpha-D-mannoside or NaCl, suggestive that the receptor is a glycoprotein."
https://openalex.org/W1481594091,"The nucleotide sequence of the Escherichia coli metJ regulatory gene (312 nucleotides) has been determined as well as that of two mutations located within the gene. Analysis of the sequence downstream from the metJ gene has revealed inverted repeats homologous to several intercistronic regions, also reported to occur between operons. A hybrid protein that contains the 55 first amino acid residues of the metJ protein substituting for the 8 amino acid residues at the NH2 terminus of beta-galactosidase was produced by gene fusion. The hybrid protein retaining beta-galactosidase activity was purified. Its amino-terminal sequence was determined and this allowed us to locate the translational start codon of the metJ gene. Evidence was provided for autoregulation by repression of the metJ gene. By sequencing upstream from metJ, the region situated between the metJ and metB genes was found to contain putative operator structures that we propose to call Met boxes."
https://openalex.org/W1797636376,"From the inserts of two recombinant plasmids isolated from a murine liver cDNA library, the nucleotide sequence coding for the C3 alpha chain was obtained and the corresponding amino acid sequence was derived. The alpha chain portion of the mRNA is 2979 nucleotides long, specifying a polypeptide of 993 amino acids. The molecular weight of the alpha chain, in the absence of carbohydrate, was calculated from the sequence data to be 112,933. Two possible carbohydrate attachment sites were predicted at residues 269 (Asn) and 947 (Asn). In addition, the positions for two putative factor I cleavage sites were predicted from a comparison with the cleavage sites in the human C3 alpha chain. The C3 alpha chain contains 24 cysteine residues, 10 of these clustered in the C-terminal 175 amino acids of the alpha chain. Together with the accompanying report (Lundwall, A, Wetsel, R.A., Domdey, H., Tack, B.F., and Fey, G.H. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 13851-13856), this study completes the nucleotide and amino acid structure of the murine precursor prepro-C3 molecule."
https://openalex.org/W2085180719,"The unique oncogene carried by the McDonough strain of feline sarcoma virus (SM-FeSV), called v-fms, directs the synthesis of a set of related glycoproteins, called gP 180gag-fms, gp 140fms, and gp 120fms. We have prepared antibodies to these proteins and used indirect immunofluorescence techniques on viable SM-FeSV transformed cells to demonstrate that fms-specific determinants are expressed on the external surface. The fms-specific fluorescence co-localized with clathrin and was detectable in clathrin-coated pits and endocytotic vesicles. Two cell surface labeling methods indicated that gp140fms was the only fms-related protein on the cell surface. In view of the relationship between the erbB oncogene product and the epidermal growth factor receptor, and the fact that growth factor receptors utilize clathrin-coated pits in endocytosis, we believe the gp140fms transforming protein of SM-FeSV also could function as an analog of a growth factor receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1980137879,"The distribution of newly synthesized DNA strands in the transposition products of bacteriophage Mu made in an in vitro system has been analyzed. The results support a model in which all Mu transpositions are initiated by a pair of strand transfer reactions that attach the 3' ends of Mu DNA to 5' protruding staggered ends of the target DNA. Joining of these ends produces a pair of structures similar to replication forks at the ends of the Mu DNA. Successful initiation of replication at either one or both ends, followed by a round of semiconservative replication, results in formation of a cointegrate structure. When the intermediate structure fails to replicate, breakage of the junctions between the Mu sequence and the vector sequence derived from the donor molecule can lead to a simple insert with a pair of gaps at the 5' ends of the Mu DNA. Evidence for a gap repair process that completes the simple insertion process has been obtained."
https://openalex.org/W1526232150,"DNA fragments from the Streptomyces antibioticus genome have been cloned in Streptomyces lividans using the SphI site of the vector, pIJ702. Using a sib selection procedure, transformants were screened for their ability to produce levels of the enzyme, phenoxazinone synthase, which were detectable by enzyme assay. Three clones were obtained by this procedure. The recombinant plasmids from these clones contained inserts of 1.77, 2.45, and 4.28 kilobases in size. The clones and the corresponding recombinant plasmids were, therefore, referred to as PHS 1.8, PHS 2.4 and PHS 4.3. PHS 2.4 produced transformants with significantly higher phenoxazinone synthase specific activities than those observed in comparably grown S. antibioticus. Southern blotting showed that the cloned 2.45-kilobase insert hybridized to a fragment of exactly the same size in an SphI digest of S. antibioticus total DNA. Using a streptomycete-coupled transcription-translation system, PHS 2.4 was shown to code for the synthesis of a protein with the electrophoretic and immunological properties of the phenoxazinone synthase subunit. Thus, the 2.45-kilobase insert represents the structural gene for that subunit. The protein produced by S. lividans transformed with PHS 2.4 was shown to be virtually identical to the S. antibioticus subunit in terms of its electrophoretic mobility, peptide profile, and amino acid composition. It was further observed that cloning of the 2.45-kilobase insert in the orientation opposite to that obtained originally still resulted in high levels of phenoxazinone synthase expression in transformed S. lividans. However, the repression of phenoxazinone synthase synthesis by glucose which has been observed in S. antibioticus was not found when PHS 2.4 was used to transform S. lividans."
https://openalex.org/W1582296137,"Kringle 1 (Tyr 79/Leu 80-His 167 and Tyr 79/Leu 80-Tyr 173), a chymotryptic fragment of human plasminogen that has high affinity for fibrin and omega-aminocarboxylic acids, has been subjected to modification with 1,2-cyclohexanedione to identify arginine residues essential for ligand binding. Reaction of 1,2-cyclohexanedione with kringle 1 was found to rapidly abolish the fibrin-Sepharose affinity of the fragment, whereas the affinity for lysine-Sepharose was lost at a significantly slower rate. Successive affinity chromatography of modified kringle 1 on fibrin- and lysine-Sepharose was used to separate kringle 1 that lost affinity for fibrin-, but retained affinity for lysine-Sepharose from kringle 1 that lost affinity for both affinants. The modified proteins were subjected to structural studies in order to locate the labeled arginine residues in kringle 1. These studies have revealed that modification of Arg 34 leads to the loss of both the fibrin- and lysine-Sepharose affinities of kringle 1, whereas reaction of Arg 32 abolishes fibrin affinity but leaves lysine-Sepharose affinity unaltered. The results suggest that Arg 32 and Arg 34 are both involved in fibrin binding and that Arg 34 is also involved in binding omega-aminocarboxylic acids. Previous NMR studies on kringles have indeed shown that the segment containing residue 34 is in the proximity of and interacts with the omega-aminocarboxylic acid-binding site. This interaction may explain the influence of omega-aminocarboxylic acids on fibrin binding by kringle 1."
https://openalex.org/W1528113712,"Electron spin resonance spectroscopy has been used to demonstrate production of semiquinone-free radicals from the oxidation of the catechol estrogens 2- and 4-hydroxyestradiol and 2,6- and 4,6-dihydroxyestradiol. Radicals were generated either enzymatically (using horseradish peroxidase-H2O2 or tyrosinase-O2) or by autoxidation, and were detected as their complexes with spin-stabilizing metal ions (Zn2+ and/or Mg2+). In the peroxidase system, radicals are produced by one-electron oxidation of the catechol estrogen and their decay is by a second-order pathway, consistent with their disproportionation to quinone and catechol products. With tyrosinase-O2, radical generation occurs indirectly. Initial hydroxylation of phenolic estrogen (at either the 2- or 4-position) gives a catechol estrogen in situ; subsequent two-electron oxidation of the catechol to the quinone, followed by reverse disproportionation, leads to the formation of radicals. A competing mechanism for radical production involves autoxidation of the catechol. Results obtained from the estrogen systems have been compared with those from the model compound 5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-2-naphthol."

Addition of leukotriene C4 to the recirculating perfusion buffer was observed to cause a persistent increase in the pulmonary arterial pressure. Leukotriene C4 instilled into the airway of the perfused lung was also rapidly metabolized to these same products with retention of the products within the lung. In contrast, leukotriene B4 injected into the perfusion fluid was recovered unchanged in the lung effluent. Leukotriene B4 instilled into the airway of the perfused lung was observed to rapidly traverse the alveolar membranes and was recovered intact in the lung effluent. No evidence for formation of the 20-hydroxy or the 20-carboxy metabolites of leukotriene B4 by the isolated perfused rat lung was observed."
https://openalex.org/W1509206746,"An iron-sulfur protein has been purified from beef heart ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase (Complex III) of the mitochondrial respiratory chain by phenyl-Sepharose column chromatography and Sephacryl S-200 gel chromatography. Depletion of most of the endogenous phospholipids in the complex was a prerequisite to the dissociation of the protein from the complex in the former chromatography. The iron-sulfur protein was nearly homogeneous as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and contained 76 ng atoms of nonheme iron and 66 nmol of acid-labile sulfide/mg of protein. When this preparation was incubated with an iron-sulfur protein-depleted complex in the presence of soybean phospholipids, the enzymic activity was restored up to 90% of that of the parent Complex III, whereas the recovery of the activity was marginal in the absence of the phospholipids. Thus it is clear that the iron-sulfur protein is integrated into the complex with the aid of phospholipids."

https://openalex.org/W1515638832,"M13 RF DNA was synthesized in vitro in the presence of various single deoxynucleoside 5'-O-(1-thiotriphosphate) phosphorothioate analogues, and the three other appropriate deoxynucleoside triphosphates using a M13 (+)-single-stranded template, Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I and T4 DNA ligase. The resulting DNAs contained various restriction endonuclease recognition sequences which had been modified at their cleavage points in the (-)-strand by phosphorothioate substitution. The behavior of the restriction enzymes AvaI, BamHI, EcoRI, HindIII, and SalI towards these substituted DNAs was investigated. EcoRI, BamHI, and HindIII were found to cleave appropriate phosphorothioate-substituted DNA at a reduced rate compared to normal M13 RF DNA, and by a two-step process in which all of the DNA is converted to an isolable intermediate nicked molecule containing a specific discontinuity at the respective recognition site presumably in the (+)-strand. By contrast, SalI cleaved substituted DNA effectively without the intermediacy of a nicked form. AvaI, however, is only capable of cleaving the unsubstituted (+)-strand in appropriately modified DNA."

In this communication we report the catalytic properties of the enzyme. The enzyme catalyzes the phosphorylation of deoxythymidine monophosphate to form deoxythymidine diphosphate in the presence of phosphate donor. ATP and dATP are the most efficient phosphate donors. In addition to dTMP, the yeast enzyme can use dUMP and 5-iodo-dUMP as phosphate acceptors. Kinetic analysis gives a Km of 0.5 mM for dTMP and 2 mM for dUMP. dTMP has a 7-fold greater rate constant than dUMP. Thymidylate kinase requires a divalent cation and is active over the entire range of pH from 6 to 9. The relative inhibitory effects of related compounds on yeast thymidylate kinase activity are in the order of dTDP greater than thymidine greater than 5-iodo-dUMP greater than ADP greater than or equal to dADP greater than dUMP greater than dTTP greater than dUDP, if dTMP is used as the phosphate acceptor. dTDP is a competitive inhibitor, with a Ki of 0.62 mM. Subcellular fractionation indicates that thymidylate kinase is found in the combined nuclear and cytoplasmic fraction but not in the mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W1498484903,"The bidirectional hydrogenase from Clostridium pasteurianum W5 is an iron-sulfur protein containing approximately 12 Fe atoms and 12 labile sulfides. We have studied oxidized samples of the enzyme with Mossbauer and electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) spectroscopy to elucidate the nature of the center that gives rise to the EPR signal with principal g-values at 2.10, 2.04, and 2.01. The g = 2.10 center exhibits two well-resolved 57Fe ENDOR resonances. One is isotropic with A1 = 9.5 MHz; the other is nearly isotropic with A2 = 17 MHz. These magnetic hyperfine coupling constants are substantially (approximately 50%) smaller than those observed for [2Fe-2S], [3Fe-4S], and [4Fe-4S] clusters. The Mossbauer and ENDOR data, taken together, suggest that the g = 2.10 center contains at least two but not more than four iron atoms. Comparison of our data with recent results reported for Escherichia coli sulfite reductase and the ferricyanide-treated [4Fe-4S] cluster from Azotobacter vinelandii ferredoxin I suggests that the g = 2.10 center may possibly be formed, by oxidation, from a structure with a [4Fe-4S] core. The Mossbauer spectra give evidence that at least 8 of the 12 Fe atoms of oxidized hydrogenase are organized in two ferredoxin-type [4Fe-4S] clusters, supporting conclusions derived previously from EPR studies of the reduced enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1496981472,"The nucleotide sequence of the HindIII-D fragment of adenovirus type 2 has been determined. The sequence, which is located between coordinates 41.8 and 51.0, covers most of the L2 cotermination family. It includes three major open translational reading frames encoding the carboxyl-terminal part of the penton base as well as the major core polypeptides V and VII. An additional minor open translational reading frame encoding a highly basic polypeptide was detected in the sequence. The L2 region has a very compact organization with very short distances between the different genes, although no overlapping coding sequences were found. The predicted amino acid sequences of core proteins V and VII reveal that they are highly basic proteins and polypeptide VII resembles the arginine-rich H4 histones in its amino acid composition, but no striking similarities are apparent at the amino acid sequence level. The candidate polypeptide encoded by the newly discovered translational reading frame contains 29% basic residues and includes a hypothetical recognition sequence for the adenovirus-encoded endopeptidase. In conjunction with previously published sequences and those reported in accompanying papers (Akusjarvi, G., Alestrom, P., Pettersson, M., Lager, M., Jornvall, H., and Pettersson, U. (1984) J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1509865461,"Site-directed mutagenesis was employed to replace cysteine 12 with phenylalanine in Bacillus subtilis glutamine phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (amidophosphoribosyltransferase). Glutamine-dependent amidophosphoribosyltransferase activity was abolished as a consequence of the mutation. The mutant enzyme, however, exhibited NH3-dependent activity, contained Fe-S, and was normally regulated by AMP. These results document the role of the active site cysteine in activation of glutamine for amide transfer. NH3-dependent amidophosphoribosyltransferase was utilized for de novo purine nucleotide synthesis. Cells containing the mutant enzyme grew at nearly the wild-type rate in media containing a high concentration of NH4Cl. The Phe-12 mutation was used to study NH2-terminal processing. Whereas the wild-type Cys-12 enzyme is processed correctly in Escherichia coli by removal of 11 amino acid residues from the NH2 terminus, the Phe-12 mutant enzyme was not subject to undecapeptide processing. Neither the mutant nor wild-type enzyme made in vitro was correctly processed. Alternative enzymatic and autocatalytic processing mechanisms were considered. The available evidence favors autocatalytic NH2-terminal undecapeptide processing."
https://openalex.org/W1524498828,"Recombinant plasmids carrying Streptomyces antibioticus DNA (phenoxazinone synthase plasmids 1.8 and 4.3) have been used as templates in a streptomycete-coupled transcription-translation system. Analysis of the synthetic products from these experiments shows that PHS 1.8 and 4.3 appear to code for polypeptides which are not structurally related, as judged by immunoprecipitability, to the phenoxazinone synthase subunit. 35S-labeled cell extracts of Streptomyces lividans and S. lividans transformed with the phenoxazinone synthase plasmids each contain a protein which is precipitable with antiserum to S. antibioticus phenoxazinone synthase. These proteins have exactly the same electrophoretic mobility as the S. antibioticus phenoxazinone synthase subunit on one-and two-dimensional gels and the peptide maps of the proteins from the S. lividans clones are essentially indistinguishable from the map of the S. antibioticus phenoxazinone synthase subunit. Glycerol-gradient centrifugation of extracts of cells transformed with PHS 1.8 and 4.3 showed that both the large and small phenoxazinone synthase enzyme forms were present. Southern hybridization experiments demonstrated that pIJ2505, a pBR322 derivative containing the phenoxazinone synthase structural gene, hybridized to S. lividans DNA digested with BclI, SphI, SstI, and XhoI. The results obtained are discussed in terms of the hypothesis that the expression of phenoxazinone synthase activity in cells transformed with the PHS 1.8 and 4.3 plasmids results from the activation of an endogenous phenoxazinone synthase gene in S. lividans (and perhaps in other streptomycetes in the case of PHS 4.3) which is normally silent or expressed at very low levels."

(1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 48-53). From one such transformed cell clone, cloned recombinant lambda phages containing DNA fragments were obtained recently that were concluded by circumstantial genetic evidence to have been derived from the human thymidylate synthase gene (Takeishi, K., Ayusawa, D., Kaneda, S., Shimizu, K., and Seno, T.

The cloned cDNA plasmid containing an insert of approximately 1.7-kilobase transformed mouse thymidine auxotrophic mutant cells to thymidine prototrophic cells at a frequency of 2-3 transformants/micrograms of DNA/10(5) cells, a value almost comparable to the highest so far reported.

https://openalex.org/W1527199045,"Two thioredoxin fractions had previously been reported to occur in Anabaena 7119 by Buchanan and co-workers (Yee, B. C., dela Torre, A., Crawford, N. A., Lara, C., Carlson, D. E., and Buchanan, B. B. (1981) Arch. Microbiol. 130, 14-18). These proteins were detected by their ability to activate spinach fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (Fru-P2-ase). The partially purified proteins resembled similar thioredoxins found in spinach chloroplasts and were designated thioredoxin f (Tf) for the fraction most effective in activating spinach Fru-P2-ase and thioredoxin m (Tm) for the fraction most effective in activating spinach NADPH-malate dehydrogenase. Using the assay system of Yee and co-workers, we were able to separate and purify to homogeneity two thioredoxin fractions from Anabaena extracts. Tm corresponded to the thioredoxin fraction we had isolated and studied previously (Gleason, F. K., and Holmgren, A. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 8301-8309). The other fraction, Tf, was characterized further. Unlike the thioredoxins found in higher plants, the cyanobacterial thioredoxins do not appear to be related. Anabaena thioredoxin f has a Mr = 25,500 as compared to the more usual Mr = 12,000 for Tm. From a comparison of the amino acid composition, Tf is not obviously a dimer or otherwise related to Tm. Tf has one active center cystine disulfide. Anabaena Tf activates spinach Fru-P2-ase very efficiently but has very little activity with spinach malate dehydrogenase. Anabaena Tf, unlike Tm, does not reduce the homologous ribonucleotide reductase. Anabaena Tf also does not activate a partially purified preparation of Anabaena Fru-P2-ase. We conclude that the cyanobacterial Tf is a unique protein with no structural or functional properties in common with other thioredoxins."
https://openalex.org/W2106092122,"Dolichyl [beta-32P]pyrophosphate ([beta-32P]Dol-P-P) has been prepared chemically to study Dol-P-P phosphatase in calf brain. Calf brain microsomes catalyze the enzymatic release of 32Pi from exogenous [beta-32P]Dol-P-P by a bacitracin-sensitive reaction. [32P]Pyrophosphate was not detected with the water-soluble product even when 1 mM sodium pyrophosphate was added to impede pyrophosphatase activity. A substantial fraction of the Dol-P-P phosphatase activity can be solubilized by treating brain microsomes with 3% Triton X-100. The detergent extracts catalyze the enzymatic release of 32Pi from [beta-32P]Dol-P-P and the conversion of [14C]undecaprenyl pyrophosphate to [14C]undecaprenyl monophosphate. The solubilized Dol-P-P phosphatase activity: 1) is optimal at neutral pH; 2) is inhibited by Mn2+ and stimulated by EDTA; 3) exhibits an apparent Km = 20 microM for Dol-P-P; 4) is competitively inhibited by undecaprenyl pyrophosphate, and 5) is blocked by bacitracin. Solubilized Dol-P-P phosphatase activity differs from Dol-P phosphatase activity present in the same detergent extracts with respect to: 1) thermolability at 50 degrees C, 2) effect of 20 mM EDTA, and 3) sensitivity to phosphate and fluoride ions. These studies describe the chemical synthesis of [beta-32P]Dol-P-P for use in a convenient assay of Dol-P-P phosphatase activity. A procedure for the solubilization of Dol-P-P phosphatase activity from microsomes is presented, and an enzymological comparison indicates that Dol-P-P and Dol-P phosphatase are separate enzymes in calf brain."
https://openalex.org/W1480322783,"At the concentrations usually employed as a Ca2+ indicator, arsenazo III underwent a one-electron reduction by rat liver mitochondria to produce an azo anion radical as demonstrated by electron-spin resonance spectroscopy. Either NADH or NADPH could serve as a source of reducing equivalents for the production of this free radical by intact rat liver mitochondria. Under aerobic conditions, addition of arsenazo III to rat liver mitochondria produced an increase in electron flow from NAD(P)H to molecular oxygen, generating superoxide anion. NAD(P)H generated from endogenous mitochondrial NAD(P)+ by intramitochondrial reactions could not be used for the NAD(P)H azoreductase reaction unless the mitochondria were solubilized by detergent or anaerobiosis. In addition, NAD(P)H azoreductase activity was higher in the crude outer mitochondrial membrane fraction than in mitoplasts and intact mitochondria. The steady-state concentration of the azo anion radical and the arsenazo III-stimulated cyanide-insensitive oxygen consumption were enhanced by calcium and magnesium, suggesting that, in addition to an enhanced azo anion radical-stabilization by complexation with the metal ions, enhanced reduction of arsenazo III also occurred. Accordingly, addition of cations to crude outer mitochondrial membrane preparations increased arsenazo III-stimulated cyanide-insensitive O2 consumption, H2O2 formation, and NAD(P)H oxidation. Antipyrylazo III was much less effective than arsenazo III in increasing superoxide anion formation by rat liver mitochondria and gave a much weaker electron spin resonance spectrum of an azo anion radical. These results provide direct evidence of an azoreductase activity associated with the outer mitochondrial membrane and of a stimulation of arsenazo III reduction by cations."

The nauplii exhibit a burst of Na,K-ATPase synthesis between 6 and 32 h of development (Peterson, G. L., Churchill, L., Fisher, J. A., and Hokin, L. E. (1982) J. Exp. Zool. 221, 295-308). We have now determined the sites of synthesis of the alpha and beta subunits of the Na,K-ATPase in developing A. salina nauplii. Membrane-bound and free polysomes were isolated from nauplii, and RNA was extracted from the polysomes. The polysomal RNA was translated in vitro in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate, and the translation products were immunoprecipitated by anti-subunit antisera. The immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by fluorography. Our data show that the alpha subunit precursor is synthesized on membrane-bound polysomes and the beta subunit precursor is synthesized on free polysomes. In addition, the alpha subunit precursor appears as two separate peptides on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels, which suggests that the two alpha subunit forms seen in mature brine shrimp Na,K-ATPase are products of two distinct messenger RNAs. The beta subunit precursor appears as a single discrete band, unlike the mature beta subunit, which appears as a diffuse band."

Characteristics of the two reactions catalyzed by this enzyme are studied. Guanylyltransferase is most active at pH 7.0 in the presence of 3 mM Mg2+, and utilizes GTP as a guanylyl donor with an apparent Km of 5 microM, and ppGCC (A2, U2, G)n as a guanylyl acceptor with two Km values of 0.5 and 4 microM. It catalyzes GTP-PPi exchange in the absence of the acceptor RNA, and forms a covalent enzyme-GMP intermediate having Mr = 45,000 in sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis. RNAs with 5'-diphosphoryl as well as 5'-triphosphoryl ends are capped, while mononucleotides such as GDP and ppGp are inert. Since guanylyltransferase can utilize ppGpC and ppGpCpC as acceptors, the presence of at least one phosphodiester bond seems to be sufficient for the acceptor activity. However, oligonucleotides of longer chain length are preferred. RNA 5'-triphosphatase associated with the purified enzyme requires Mg2+ and exhibits a broad pH optimum from 6.5 to 8.5, and an apparent Km value for pppA-terminated poly(A) is 1.4 microM. The enzyme is specific for the gamma-phosphoryl group at the 5'-terminus of RNA and does not hydrolyze ATP. It can hydrolyze the gamma-phosphoryl group of pppGp, but the RNA substrates with longer chain length are preferred."
https://openalex.org/W1605381947,"Experiments aimed at the partial reconstitution of the intracellular transport systems regulating the cytosolic free Ca2+ homeostasis are reported. Rat insulinoma subcellular fractions enriched in mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum (microsomes), and secretory granules were studied. The ambient free Ca2+ concentration maintained by the separate or combined organelles was determined with a Ca2+-selective minielectrode. The data demonstrate that ambient [Ca2+] is established by the microsomes, not by the mitochondria or the secretory granules, in the range of resting cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations (0.1-0.2 microM Ca2+). Furthermore, the microsomes are able to deplete largely the mitochondria of their exchangeable calcium. Nonetheless, both mitochondria and microsomes, but not secretory granules, function as a coordinated unit to restore the previous ambient [Ca2+] following its perturbation. Thus, mitochondria play a major role in bringing down rapidly ambient [Ca2+] to the submicromolar range, whereas the endoplasmic reticulum acts as a relay in the transport mechanisms which lower [Ca2+] to the resting level."
https://openalex.org/W1547277102,"N-Bromoacetylethanolamine phosphate and 3-bromo-1,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone 1,4-bisphosphate have been tested in order to study the hexose phosphate binding sites of a bifunctional enzyme, fructose-6-P,2-kinase:fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase. N-Bromoacetylethanolamine phosphate is a competitive inhibitor with respect to fructose-6-P (Ki = 0.24 mM) and a noncompetitive inhibitor with ATP (Ki = 0.8 mM). The reagent inactivates fructose-6-P,2-kinase but not fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase, and the inactivation is prevented by fructose-6-P. The inactivation reaction follows pseudo first-order kinetics to completion and with increasing concentrations of N-bromoacetylethanolamine phosphate a rate saturation effect is observed. The concentration of the reagent giving the half-maximum inactivation is 2.2 mM and the apparent first order rate constant is 0.0046 s-1. The enzyme alkylated by N-bromoacetylethanolamine-P has lost over 90% of the kinase activity, retains nearly full activity of fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase, and its inhibition by fructose-6-P is not altered. 3-Bromo-1,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone 1,4-bisphosphate is also a competitive inhibitor of fructose-6-P,2-kinase with respect to fructose-6-P in the forward reaction and fructose-2,6-P2 in the reverse direction. This reagent inhibits 93% of fructose-6-P,2-kinase but activates fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase 3.7-fold. 3-Bromo-1,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone 1,4-bisphosphate alters the fructose-2,6-P2 saturation kinetic curve from negative cooperativity to normal Michaelis-Menten kinetics with K0.5 of 0.8 microM. The reagent, however, has no effect on the fructose-6-P inhibition of the phosphatase. These results strongly suggest that hexose phosphate binding sites of fructose-6-P,2-kinase and fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase are distinct and located in different regions of this bifunctional enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1590919614,"Several aspects of the interaction of xanthine oxidase with arsenite are investigated. Room temperature potentiometric titrations using EPR to monitor Molybdenum reduction reveal midpoint potentials of -225 mV for the Mo(VI)-arsenite/Mo(V)-arsenite couple and -440 mV for the Mo(V)-arsenite/Mo(IV)-arsenite couple at pH 8.3. Under the same conditions, the values for native enzyme are -395 mV and -420 mV, respectively. The predicted effects of the altered Mo(VI)/Mo(V) potential on the distributions of reducing equivalents in partially reduced enzyme are compared with the experimentally observed effects in optical experiments. The bleaching that occurs on reduction of the chromophore that is generated when arsenite binds to oxidized enzyme is characterized and found to be associated with reduction of Mo(V)-arsenite to Mo(V)-arsenite. This probe enables determination of the midpoint potential for this conversion using optical data. From such data at a series of pH values ranging from 6.15 to 9.9, a pH dependence of -60 mV/pH unit increase is determined for this couple above pH 7. The ability of arsenite to bind to reduced xanthine oxidase and to desulfo enzyme are also investigated. Reduced active enzyme binds arsenite much more tightly (Kd less than 0.1 microM) and more rapidly than does oxidized active enzyme (Kd = 8 microM); oxidized desulfo enzyme binds arsenite almost as tightly (Kd = 20 microM) as does the oxidized active enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1641919774,"Human high-density lipoprotein class-3 (HDL3) was incubated with freshly isolated blood polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) at 37 and 4 degrees C. At both temperatures the release of proteolytic activity (PA) causing the specific hydrolysis of apo-A-II was dependent on the concentration of HDL3 in the medium. At 37 degrees C, the efflux of PA was linear and no saturation was reached up to an HDL3 protein concentration in the medium of 800 micrograms/ml. In turn, at 4 degrees C, maximal PA release was reached at a concentration below 600 micrograms/ml of HDL3 protein/ml in the medium. Canine HDL, which contains apo-A-I, but not apo-A-II, was as effective as human HDL3 in promoting the release of PA from PMN. This property was also exhibited by egg lecithin/cholesterol vesicles containing apo-A-I. At 4 degrees C, there was no strict correlation between efflux of PA affected by HDL3 and specific binding of 125I-apo-A-I (HDL3). In competitive binding experiments, a 50-fold excess of unlabeled HDL3 prevented more than 90% of the binding of 125I-apo-A-I (HDL3) to PMN, whereas an excess of unlabeled low-density lipoprotein exhibited no effect. When human HDL3 was incubated with PMN at 4 or 37 degrees C and then subjected to ultracentrifugation at d 1.21 g/ml, most of the PA that was initially associated with this lipoprotein was recovered in the bottom of the tube. By gel filtration, both PA and HDL3 were in the same peak in a low ionic strength buffer, but were dissociated from each other by a high-salt solution (d 1.21 g/ml). We conclude that both naturally occurring HDLs and apo-A-I-stabilized lipid vesicles favor the release from PMN of an enzymatic activity which cleaves human apo-A-II. This release appears to be dependent both on the interaction of the cells with the lipoprotein ligand and on the lipoprotein surface area acting as the acceptor for the enzyme, probably through electrostatic forces."
https://openalex.org/W1519991535,"Bovine serum albumin inhibits the light activation of bovine rod disc membrane (RDM) cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase. The KI for inhibition is 32 microM at pH 8 and 37 degrees C. Trypsin-activated phosphodiesterase was not inhibited under these conditions, suggesting that albumin does not alter substrate access to the enzyme. Light titration curves of phosphodiesterase activity were vertically displaced downwards by albumin. The lack of displacement along the bleach axis indicated no loss in relative light sensitivity, but rather loss of a constant fraction of the normal activity for each bleach level. Thus, activated rhodopsin appeared to be functional in the presence of albumin. However, the metarhodopsin II yield with less than 10% bleached was reduced in the presence of albumin. This effect was quantitatively explained by albumin elution of GTP-binding protein from the RDM. Similarly, the reduction in light-induced phosphodiesterase activity quantitatively matched GTP-binding protein elution by albumin. beta-Lactoglobulin, which, like albumin, is known to bind hydrophobic molecules, also inhibits phosphodiesterase activation. In contrast, ovalbumin, which has little hydrophobic binding affinity, had little or no inhibitory effect on phosphodiesterase light activation. We conclude that albumin and other molecules capable of hydrophobic interactions inhibit light activation of RDM-phosphodiesterase by selectively eluting GTP-binding protein from the membrane into the surrounding medium where it is unable to efficiently gain access to activated rhodopsin."
