https://openalex.org/W2092166712,"miRNAs act as oncogenes or tumor suppressors in a wide variety of human cancers, including prostate cancer (PCa). We found a severe and consistent downregulation of miRNAs, miR-154, miR-299-5p, miR-376a, miR-376c, miR-377, miR-381, miR-487b, miR-485-3p, miR-495 and miR-654-3p, mapped to the 14q32.31 region in metastatic cell lines as compared with normal prostatic epithelial cells (PrEC). In specimens of human prostate (28 normals, 99 primary tumors and 13 metastases), lower miRNA levels correlated significantly with a higher incidence of metastatic events and higher prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels, with similar trends observed for lymph node invasion and the Gleason score. We transiently transfected 10 members of the 14q32.31 cluster in normal prostatic epithelial cell lines and characterized their affect on malignant cell behaviors, including proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion. Finally, we identified FZD4, a gene important for epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in (PCa), as a target of miR-377."

While metastasis is the most common cause of death among PCa patients, no specific markers have been assigned to severity and ethnic biasness of the disease. MicroRNAs represent a promising new class of biomarkers owing to their inherent stability and resilience. In the present study, we investigated potential miRNAs that can be used as biomarkers and/or therapeutic targets and can provide insight into the severity and ethnic biasness of PCa. PCR array was performed in FFPE PCa tissues (5 Caucasian American and 5 African American) and selected differentially expressed miRNAs were validated by qRT-PCR, in 40 (15 CA and 25 AA) paired PCa and adjacent normal tissues. Significantly deregulated miRNAs were also analyzed in urine samples to explore their potential as non-invasive biomarker for PCa. Out of 8 miRNAs selected for validation from PCR array data, miR-205 (p<0.0001), mir-214 (p<0.0001), miR-221(p<0.001) and miR-99b (p<0.0001) were significantly downregulated in PCa tissues. ROC curve shows that all four miRNAs successfully discriminated between PCa and adjacent normal tissues. MiR-99b showed significant down regulation (p<0.01) in AA PCa tissues as compared to CA PCa tissues and might be related to the aggressiveness associated with AA population. In urine, miR-205 (p<0.05) and miR-214 (p<0.05) were significantly downregulated in PCa patients and can discriminate PCa patients from healthy individuals with 89% sensitivity and 80% specificity. In conclusion, present study showed that miR-205 and miR-214 are downregulated in PCa and may serve as potential non-invasive molecular biomarker for PCa."
https://openalex.org/W2087522345,"Photoplethysmogram (PPG) monitoring is not only essential for critically ill patients in hospitals or at home, but also for those undergoing exercise testing. However, processing PPG signals measured after exercise is challenging, especially if the environment is hot and humid. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm that can detect systolic peaks under challenging conditions, as in the case of emergency responders in tropical conditions. Accurate systolic-peak detection is an important first step for the analysis of heart rate variability. Algorithms based on local maxima-minima, first-derivative, and slope sum are evaluated, and a new algorithm is introduced to improve the detection rate. With 40 healthy subjects, the new algorithm demonstrates the highest overall detection accuracy (99.84% sensitivity, 99.89% positive predictivity). Existing algorithms, such as Billauer's, Li's and Zong's, have comparable although lower accuracy. However, the proposed algorithm presents an advantage for real-time applications by avoiding human intervention in threshold determination. For best performance, we show that a combination of two event-related moving averages with an offset threshold has an advantage in detecting systolic peaks, even in heat-stressed PPG signals."
https://openalex.org/W1989069545,"Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), and glucagon bind to related members of the same receptor superfamily and exert important effects on glucose homeostasis, insulin secretion, and energy regulation. The present study assessed the biological actions and therapeutic utility of novel GIP/glucagon/GLP-1 hybrid peptides. Nine novel peptides were synthesized and exhibited complete DPP-IV resistance and enhanced in vitro insulin secretion. The most promising peptide, [dA(2)]GLP-1/GcG, stimulated cAMP production in GIP, GLP-1, and glucagon receptor-transfected cells. Acute administration of [dA(2)]GLP-1/GcG in combination with glucose significantly lowered plasma glucose and increased plasma insulin in normal and obese diabetic (ob/ob) mice. Furthermore, [dA(2)]GLP-1/GcG elicited a protracted glucose-lowering and insulinotropic effect in high fat-fed mice. Twice daily administration of [dA(2)]GLP-1/GcG for 21 days decreased body weight and nonfasting plasma glucose and increased circulating plasma insulin concentrations in high fat-fed mice. Furthermore, [dA(2)]GLP-1/GcG significantly improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity by day 21. Interestingly, locomotor activity was increased in [dA(2)]GLP-1/GcG mice, without appreciable changes in aspects of metabolic rate. Studies in knock-out mice confirmed the biological action of [dA(2)]GLP-1/GcG via multiple targets including GIP, GLP-1, and glucagon receptors. The data suggest significant promise for novel triple-acting hybrid peptides as therapeutic options for obesity and diabetes."

https://openalex.org/W2061023907,"Eukaryotic cell membranes are organized into functional lipid and protein domains, the most widely studied being membrane rafts. Although rafts have been associated with numerous plasma membrane functions, the mechanisms by which these domains themselves are regulated remain undefined. Bile acids (BAs), whose primary function is the solubilization of dietary lipids for digestion and absorption, can affect cells by interacting directly with membranes. To investigate whether these interactions affected domain organization in biological membranes, we assayed the effects of BAs on biomimetic synthetic liposomes, isolated plasma membranes, and live cells. At cytotoxic concentrations, BAs dissolved synthetic and cell-derived membranes and disrupted live cell plasma membranes, implicating plasma membrane damage as the mechanism for BA cellular toxicity. At subtoxic concentrations, BAs dramatically stabilized domain separation in Giant Plasma Membrane Vesicles without affecting protein partitioning between coexisting domains. Domain stabilization was the result of BA binding to and disordering the nonraft domain, thus promoting separation by enhancing domain immiscibility. Consistent with the physical changes observed in synthetic and isolated biological membranes, BAs reorganized intact cell membranes, as evaluated by the spatial distribution of membrane-anchored Ras isoforms. Nanoclustering of K-Ras, related to nonraft membrane domains, was enhanced in intact plasma membranes, whereas the organization of H-Ras was unaffected. BA-induced changes in Ras lateral segregation potentiated EGF-induced signaling through MAPK, confirming the ability of BAs to influence cell signal transduction by altering the physical properties of the plasma membrane. These observations suggest general, membrane-mediated mechanisms by which biological amphiphiles can produce their cellular effects.

Bile acids are synthesized from cholesterol in the liver, stored in the gallbladder, and secreted into the small intestines as a component of enterohepatic circulation. A hallmark characteristic of bile acids is their amphiphilicity, which determines their detergent properties and affinity for dietary lipids, facilitating intestinal absorption of these lipids in the form of mixed micelles (1Hofmann A.F.

Because of this detergent effect, high concentrations of bile acids have been used extensively as membrane lysis agents in molecular cell biology. At sublytic doses, bile acids have been shown to influence cell signaling by specifically interacting both with nuclear receptors (7Zollner G. Trauner M. Nuclear receptors as therapeutic targets in cholestatic liver diseases.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2009; 156: 7-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and cell surface transporters (8Dawson P.A. Role of the intestinal bile acid transporters in bile acid and drug disposition.Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2011; 201: 169-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). However, the fact that these biological amphiphiles interact strongly with lipids led us to the hypothesis that bile acids can influence signaling elements on the cell surface by partitioning directly into the plasma membrane and altering its microenvironment. Recent advancements in the understanding of plasma membrane heterogeneity suggest that the plasma membrane microenvironment directly and dynamically regulates cell signal transduction (9Young R.M.

A subset of these domains, the lipid rafts, is driven by lipid immiscibility in the plane of the bilayer (16Veatch S.L. Keller S.L.

The physicochemical principle behind this immiscibility is the preferential interactions between certain lipid species: cholesterol, sphingolipids, and fully saturated phospholipids, whose chemistries and geometries allow efficient packing into relatively ordered domains that exclude more bulky membrane components. These bulky lipids, such as branched and polyunsaturated lipids, form coexisting, relatively disordered domains (19Sengupta P. Baird B. Holowka D.

Bile acids (BAs), as biological amphiphiles, can also intercalate into lipid membranes and alter lipid distribution (44Akare S. Martinez J.D. Bile acid induces hydrophobicity-dependent membrane alterations.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1735: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 45Jean-Louis S. Akare S. Ali M.A. Mash Jr., E.A.

Chem. 2006; 281: 14948-14960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Further, the signaling effects of bile acids correlate with their hydrophobicity and thus their membrane affinity (46Powell A.A. LaRue J.M. Batta A.K. Martinez J.D. Bile acid hydrophobicity is correlated with induction of apoptosis and/or growth arrest in HCT116 cells.Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Therefore, BAs have the potential to affect cell signaling by perturbing the organization of the plasma membrane, although there is no direct evidence for such membrane-mediated effects of BAs on signaling components at the cell surface. In this study, we have systematically examined the interaction between the unconjugated bile acids cholic and deoxycholic acid (CA and DCA, respectively) and biological/biomimetic membranes, from fully synthetic liposomes to live cell plasma membranes. We observed solubilization of model and natural membranes, correlating with cellular toxicity, at BA concentrations near the critical micellar concentration (cmc), which may approximate their levels in the lumen of the small intestine in certain pathophysiological conditions. At subtoxic (order of magnitude smaller than cmc) doses, BAs alter domain properties in isolated plasma membranes and synthetic liposomes, reflected in a reorganization of intact cell plasma membranes quantified by Ras nanoclustering. These effects on the organization of Ras lead to alterations in the efficiency of EGF-stimulated MAPK signaling. Thus, bile acids alter cell surface signaling activities by modulating the stability of lateral domains and thereby changing distribution of lipids and proteins in the plasma membrane.

Rat basophilic leukemia RBL-2H3 cells were cultured in media containing 60% minimum Eagle's medium, 30% RPMI 1640 medium, and 10% FBS supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) and transfected using nucleofection with reagents and protocol from Lonza. Wild-type BHK cells as well as BHK cells stably expressing GFP-K-Ras.G12V or GFP-H-Ras.G12V were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS. The stable cell lines were described in previous studies (33Zhou Y. Cho K.J. Plowman S.J. Hancock J.F.

Briefly, ∼6 mg of monounsaturated DOPC dissolved in chloroform was purged with nitrogen gas to evaporate chloroform and then exposed to vacuum overnight to eliminate trace amount of chloroform. The resulting lipid film was suspended in 2 ml of Tris containing 4.5 mm calcein. Subsequent vortexing and sonication for 10 min induced the formation of liposomes encapsulating high concentrations of calcein. The suspension containing a mix of calcein-containing liposomes and free calcein molecules was passed through a Sephadex G-50 column to separate liposomes, which elute in the void volume, from free calcein in the bulk solution. The calcein-containing liposomes were exposed to bile acid solutions dissolved in Tris for 30 min at 23 °C. Fluorescence intensity of calcein was measured (excitation, 472 nm; emission, 516 nm). The maximal fluorescent intensity of calcein was obtained by adding ∼0.5% Triton X-100 to completely lyse all liposomes at the end of each experiment. The percentage of calcein leakage was calculated % Leakage =(Ft−Fo)/(Fmax−Fo)*100(Eq. 1) where Ft is the fluorescent intensity of a liposome solution exposed to bile acid solutions, Fo is the control fluorescent intensity of a liposome solution before being exposed to bile acid, and Fmax is the fluorescent intensity obtained after exposure to Triton X-100. Cells cultured to 85–90% confluence, washed with PBS buffer three times, and incubated in serum-free medium containing various doses of DCA or CA. After 3 h of bile acid treatment, the suspending medium was collected, and the level of a cytosolic enzyme, LDH, was measured using a LDH assay kit from Sigma-Aldrich, according to the manufacturer's instruction (49Zhou Y.

https://openalex.org/W1976771127,"Desmosomal cadherins mediate cell-cell adhesion in epithelial tissues and have been known to be altered in cancer. We have previously shown that one of the two intestinal epithelial desmosomal cadherins, desmocollin-2 (Dsc2) loss promotes colonic epithelial carcinoma cell proliferation and tumor formation. In this study we show that loss of the other intestinal desmosomal cadherin, desmoglein-2 (Dsg2) that pairs with Dsc2, results in decreased epithelial cell proliferation and suppressed xenograft tumor growth in mice. Dsg2-deficient cells demonstrated a compensatory increase in Dsc2 expression, and small interfering RNA-mediated loss of Dsc2 restored proliferation in Dsg2-deficient cells. Dsg2 downregulation inhibited epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling and cell proliferation through altered phosphorylation of EGFR and downstream extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation in parallel with inhibited EGFR receptor internalization. Additionally, we demonstrated a central role of Dsc2 in controlling EGFR signaling and cell proliferation in intestinal epithelial cells. Consistent with these findings, analyses of human colon cancers demonstrated increased Dsg2 protein expression. Taken together, these data demonstrate that partner desmosomal cadherins Dsg2 and Dsc2 play opposing roles in controlling colonic carcinoma cell proliferation through differential effects on EGFR signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2007970434,"In Alzheimer's disease (AD), disturbed homeostasis of the proteases competing for amyloid precursor protein processing has been reported: a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 10 (ADAM10), the physiological α-secretase, is decreased in favor of the amyloid-β-generating enzyme BACE-1. To identify transcription factors that modulate the expression of either protease, we performed a screening approach: 48 transcription factors significantly interfered with ADAM10/BACE-1-promoter activity. One selective inducer of ADAM10 gene expression is the X-box binding protein-1 (XBP-1). This protein regulates the unfolded protein-response pathway. We demonstrate that particularly the spliced XBP-1 variant dose dependently regulates ADAM10 expression, which can be synergistically enhanced by 100 nM insulin. Analysis of 2 different transgenic mouse models (APP/PS1 and 5xFAD) revealed that at early time points in pathology XBP-1 metabolism is induced. This is accompanied by a 2-fold augmented ADAM10 amount as compared with nontransgenic littermates (P=0.011). Along with aging of the mice, the system is counterregulated, and XBP-1 together with ADAM10 expression level decreased to ~50% as compared with control animals. Analyses of expression levels in human AD brains showed that ADAM10 mRNA correlated with active XBP-1 (r=0.3120), but expression did not reach levels of healthy age-matched controls, suggesting deregulation of XBP-1 signaling. Our results demonstrate that XBP-1 is a driver of ADAM10 gene expression and that disturbance of this pathway might contribute to development or progression of AD.—Reinhardt, S., Schuck, F., Grösgen, S., Riemenschneider, M., Hartmann, T., Postina, R., Grimm, M., Endres, K.

https://openalex.org/W2048421231,"Assessing the trophic role and interaction of an animal is key to understanding its general ecology and dynamics. Conventional techniques used to elucidate diet, such as stomach content analysis, are not suitable for large threatened marine species. Non-lethal sampling combined with biochemical methods provides a practical alternative for investigating the feeding ecology of these species. Stable isotope and signature fatty acid analyses of muscle tissue were used for the first time to examine assimilated diet of the reef manta ray Manta alfredi, and were compared with different zooplankton functional groups (i.e. near-surface zooplankton collected during manta ray feeding events and non-feeding periods, epipelagic zooplankton, demersal zooplankton and several different zooplankton taxa). Stable isotope δ(15)N values confirmed that the reef manta ray is a secondary consumer. This species had relatively high levels of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) indicating a flagellate-based food source in the diet, which likely reflects feeding on DHA-rich near-surface and epipelagic zooplankton. However, high levels of ω6 polyunsaturated fatty acids and slightly enriched δ(13)C values in reef manta ray tissue suggest that they do not feed solely on pelagic zooplankton, but rather obtain part of their diet from another origin. The closest match was with demersal zooplankton, suggesting it is an important component of the reef manta ray diet. The ability to feed on demersal zooplankton is likely linked to the horizontal and vertical movement patterns of this giant planktivore. These new insights into the habitat use and feeding ecology of the reef manta ray will assist in the effective evaluation of its conservation needs."
https://openalex.org/W2145136453,"The glycolytic end-product lactate is a pleiotropic tumor growth-promoting factor. Its activities primarily depend on its uptake, a process facilitated by the lactate-proton symporter monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1). Therefore, targeting the transporter or its chaperon protein CD147/basigin, itself involved in the aggressive malignant phenotype, is an attractive therapeutic option for cancer, but basic information is still lacking regarding the regulation of the expression, interaction and activities of both proteins. In this study, we found that glucose deprivation dose-dependently upregulates MCT1 and CD147 protein expression and their interaction in oxidative tumor cells. While this posttranslational induction could be recapitulated using glycolysis inhibition, hypoxia, oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) inhibitor rotenone or hydrogen peroxide, it was blocked with alternative oxidative substrates and specific antioxidants, pointing out at a mitochondrial control. Indeed, we found that the stabilization of MCT1 and CD147 proteins upon glucose removal depends on mitochondrial impairment and the associated generation of reactive oxygen species. When glucose was a limited resource (a situation occurring naturally or during the treatment of many tumors), MCT1-CD147 heterocomplexes accumulated, including in cell protrusions of the plasma membrane. It endowed oxidative tumor cells with increased migratory capacities towards glucose. Migration increased in cells overexpressing MCT1 and CD147, but it was inhibited in glucose-starved cells provided with an alternative oxidative fuel, treated with an antioxidant, lacking MCT1 expression, or submitted to pharmacological MCT1 inhibition. While our study identifies the mitochondrion as a glucose sensor promoting tumor cell migration, MCT1 is also revealed as a transducer of this response, providing a new rationale for the use of MCT1 inhibitors in cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2030857870,"Aberrant expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) has been implicated in cancer initiation and progression. However, little is known about the potential role of miRNAs in glioma tumorigenesis. In this study, we found that miRNA-106b-5p was significantly upregulated in glioma tumor samples and cell lines compared with normal brain tissues, and its expression level correlated with the pathological grading. Overexpression of miR-106b-5p in glioma tumor cells significantly promoted cell proliferation, although inhibited cell apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. In contrast, knockdown of miR-106b-5p significantly inhibited cell proliferation, although enhanced cell apoptosis. Mechanistic study revealed that two target genes, retinoblastoma-like 1 (RBL1) and RBL2, were involved in miR-106b-5p’s regulation of cell proliferation and one target gene, caspase-8 (CASP8), mediated miR-106b-5p’s regulation of apoptosis. We also investigated the function of the three targets in glioma tumorigenesis by RNA interference manipulation and demonstrated that knockdown of these target genes led to cell proliferation enhancement or cell apoptosis inhibition in vitro. More interestingly, the expression levels of these targets were significantly downregulated in glioma samples and knockdown of these targets in glioma cells inhibited the xenograft tumor formation in vivo. Moreover, we verified the regulation function of miR-106b-5p and its targets on cell proliferation and apoptosis of the primary cultured astrocytes isolated from glioma tumor samples and healthy controls. Collectively, our findings show the critical roles of miR-106b-5p and its targets, RBL1, RBL2 and CASP8, in glioma tumorigenesis and provide potential candidates for malignant glioma therapy."

Srr1-mediated binding to fibrinogen is important for the attachment of GBS to human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMEC), where fibrinogen served as a bridging molecule between Srr1 and the endovascular surface (4Seo H.S.

During this binding process, fibrinogen engages a cleft between two IgG-like folds (the N2 and N3 domains) of the binding region. This docking event results in a conformational change of the adhesin, such that the flexible C terminus of the N3 domain (the “latch”) forms a β-strand and completes a β-sheet within the N2 domain, thereby “locking” the ligand in place. Deletion of the latch region of Srr1 is associated with reduced GBS binding in vitro to fibrinogen and hBMEC and resulted in attenuated virulence in a mouse model of bacteremia and meningitis (4Seo H.S.

As compared with Srr1, relatively little is known about the binding properties of Srr2 or its contribution toward GBS virulence.

In addition, strains expressing Srr2 were significantly more virulent in a mouse model of neonatal sepsis, as compared with Srr1-expressing strains (16Seifert K.N. Adderson E.E. Whiting A.A.

Delineating the molecular differences between Srr1 and Srr2 could improve our understanding of how Srr2 confers hypervirulence in S. agalactiae. We now report that both Srr1 and Srr2 bind to a specific tandem repeat region of fibrinogen Aα chain. Crystal structures and mutagenesis studies indicate that both proteins employ a DLL mechanism for host binding. Moreover, Srr2 has significantly higher binding affinity for fibrinogen as compared with Srr1, and analysis of their structures suggests that the physical positioning of the latch region may underlie this enhanced affinity. Purified human fibrinogen was obtained from Hematologic Technologies. Rabbit anti-fibrinogen IgG was purchased from Aniara. Rabbit anti-Srr2 IgG was generated by NeoPeptide, using purified recombinant protein corresponding to the binding region (BR) of Srr2. The bacteria and plasmids used in this study are listed in TABLE 1, TABLE 2. S. agalactiae strains were grown in Todd-Hewitt broth (Difco) supplemented with 0.5% yeast extract (THY). All mutant strains grew comparably well in vitro, as compared with parent strains (data not shown). Escherichia coli strains DH5α, BL21, and BL21(DE3) were grown at 37 °C under aeration in Luria broth (LB; Difco).

The recombinant proteins were purified by affinity chromatography with amylose resin, according to the manufacturer's instructions (New England Biolabs). Cysteine replacement mutations were made within latch and latching cleft domains of Srr-BRs by a two-stage PCR procedure. For codon conversion to cysteine in the latching cleft, overlapping primers were used with either primer 3006(NotI)/5003 (N423C) or 3003(N423C)/5006(XhoI) for Srr1-BR and either 3012(NotI)/5009 (N336C) or 3009(N339C)/5012(XhoI) for Srr2-BR to generate overlapping DNA fragments spanning the entire Srr1-BR and Srr2-BR. The two DNA fragments were combined for the second stage PCR and then amplified using primers 3006(NotI)/5006(XhoI, K639C) for the Srr1-BR and 3012(NotI)/5012(XhoI, N541C) for Srr2-BR. Amplified products were digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes and ligated into pET28-FLAG. The constructs were sequenced to confirm that the mutations were correctly positioned and then expressed in E. coli, as described above. Genomic DNA was isolated from COH1 and NCTC 10/84 strains, using Wizard Genomic DNA purification kits (Promega).

https://openalex.org/W1976626755,"Synovial sarcoma is a high-grade soft tissue malignancy characterized by a specific reciprocal translocation t(X;18), which leads to the fusion of the SS18 (SYT) gene to one of three SSX genes (SSX1, SSX2 or SSX4). The resulting chimeric SS18-SSX protein is suggested to act as an oncogenic transcriptional regulator. Despite multimodal therapeutic approaches, metastatic disease is often lethal and the development of novel targeted therapeutic strategies is required. Several expression-profiling studies identified distinct gene expression signatures, implying a consistent role of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in synovial sarcoma tumorigenesis. Here we investigate the functional and therapeutic relevance of Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation in vitro and in vivo. Immunohistochemical analyses of nuclear β-catenin and Wnt downstream targets revealed activation of canonical Wnt signaling in a significant subset of 30 primary synovial sarcoma specimens. Functional aspects of Wnt signaling including dependence of Tcf/β-catenin complex activity on the SS18-SSX fusion proteins were analyzed. Efficient SS18-SSX-dependent activation of the Tcf/β-catenin transcriptional complex was confirmed by TOPflash reporter luciferase assays and immunoblotting. In five human synovial sarcoma cell lines, inhibition of the Tcf/β-catenin protein–protein interaction significantly blocked the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling cascade, accompanied by the effective downregulation of Wnt targets (AXIN2, CDC25A, c-MYC, DKK1, CyclinD1 and Survivin) and the specific suppression of cell viability associated with the induction of apoptosis. In SYO-1 synovial sarcoma xenografts, administration of small molecule Tcf/β-catenin complex inhibitors significantly reduced tumor growth, associated with diminished AXIN2 protein levels. In summary, SS18-SSX-induced Wnt/β-catenin signaling appears to be of crucial biological importance in synovial sarcoma tumorigenesis and progression, representing a potential molecular target for the development of novel therapeutic strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2075995070,"The leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene was found to play a role in the pathogenesis of both familial and sporadic Parkinson’s disease (PD). LRRK2 encodes a large multi-domain protein that is expressed in different tissues. To date, the physiological and pathological functions of LRRK2 are not clearly defined. In this study we have explored the role of LRRK2 in controlling vesicle trafficking in different cellular or animal models and using various readouts. In neuronal cells, the presence of LRRK2G2019S pathological mutant determines increased extracellular dopamine levels either under basal conditions or upon nicotine stimulation. Moreover, mutant LRRK2 affects the levels of dopamine receptor D1 on the membrane surface in neuronal cells or animal models. Ultrastructural analysis of PC12-derived cells expressing mutant LRRK2G2019S shows an altered intracellular vesicle distribution. Taken together, our results point to the key role of LRRK2 to control vesicle trafficking in neuronal cells."
https://openalex.org/W2019355018,"Bacterial community composition in the marine environment differs from one geographical location to another. Reports that delineate the bacterial diversity of different marine samples from geographically similar location are limited. The present study aims to understand whether the bacterial community compositions from different marine samples harbour similar bacterial diversity since these are geographically related to each other.In the present study, 16S rRNA deep sequencing analysis targeting V3 region was performed using Illumina bar coded sequencing. A total of 22.44 million paired end reads were obtained from the metagenomic DNA of Marine sediment, Rhizosphere sediment, Seawater and the epibacterial DNA of Seaweed and Seagrass. Diversity index analysis revealed that Marine sediment has the highest bacterial diversity and the least bacterial diversity was observed in Rhizosphere sediment. Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes were the dominant taxa present in all the marine samples. Nearly 62-71% of rare species were identified in all the samples and most of these rare species were unique to a particular sample. Further taxonomic assignment at the phylum and genus level revealed that the bacterial community compositions differ among the samples.This is the first report that supports the fact that, bacterial community composition is specific for specific samples irrespective of its similar geographical location. Existence of specific bacterial community for each sample may drive overall difference in bacterial structural composition of each sample. Further studies like whole metagenomic sequencing will throw more insights to the key stone players and its interconnecting metabolic pathways. In addition, this is one of the very few reports that depicts the unexplored bacterial diversity of marine samples (Marine sediment, Rhizosphere sediment, Seawater) and the host associated marine samples (Seaweed and Seagrass) at higher depths from uncharacterised coastal region of Palk Bay, India using next generation sequencing technology."

https://openalex.org/W2112303554,"Cooperative organisms are ubiquitous in nature, despite their vulnerability to exploitation by cheaters. Although numerous theoretical studies suggest that spatial structure is critical for cooperation to persist, the spatial ecology of microbial cooperation remains largely unexplored experimentally. By tracking the community dynamics of cooperating (rpoS wild-type) and cheating (rpoS mutant) Escherichia coli in well-mixed flasks and microfabricated habitats, we demonstrate that spatial structure stabilizes coexistence between wild-type and mutant and thus facilitates cooperator maintenance. We develop a method to interpret our experimental results in the context of game theory, and show that the game wild-type and mutant bacteria play in an unstructured environment changes markedly over time, and eventually obeys a prisoner's dilemma leading to cheater dominance. In contrast, when wild-type and mutant E. coli co-inhabit a spatially-structured habitat, cooperators and cheaters coexist at intermediate frequencies. Our findings show that even in microhabitats lacking patchiness or spatial heterogeneities in resource availability, surface growth allows cells to form multi-cellular aggregates, yielding a self-structured community in which cooperators persist."
https://openalex.org/W2015961818,"Localization of membrane type I matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) to the leading edge is thought to be a crucial step during cancer cell invasion. However, its mechanisms and functional impact on cellular invasion have not been clearly defined. In this report, we have identified the MT-LOOP, a loop region in the catalytic domain of MT1-MMP (163PYAYIREG170), as an essential region for MT1-MMP to promote cellular invasion. Deletion of the MT-LOOP effectively inhibited functions of MT1-MMP on the cell surface, including proMMP-2 activation, degradation of gelatin and collagen films, and cellular invasion into a collagen matrix. This is not due to loss of the catalytic function of MT1-MMP but due to inefficient localization of the enzyme to β1-integrin-rich cell adhesion complexes at the plasma membrane. We also found that an antibody that specifically recognizes the MT-LOOP region of MT1-MMP (LOOPAb) inhibited MT1-MMP functions, fully mimicking the phenotype of the MT-LOOP deletion mutant. We therefore propose that the MT-LOOP region is an interface for molecular interactions that mediate enzyme localization to cell adhesion complexes and regulate MT1-MMP functions. Our findings have revealed a novel mechanism regulating MT1-MMP during cellular invasion and have identified the MT-LOOP as a potential exosite target region to develop selective MT1-MMP inhibitors.

https://openalex.org/W2090555084,"Clostridium botulinum HA is a component of the large botulinum neurotoxin complex and is critical for its oral toxicity. HA plays multiple roles in toxin penetration in the gastrointestinal tract, including protection from the digestive environment, binding to the intestinal mucosal surface, and disruption of the epithelial barrier. At least two properties of HA contribute to these roles: the sugar-binding activity and the barrier-disrupting activity that depends on E-cadherin binding of HA. HA consists of three different proteins, HA1, HA2, and HA3, whose structures have been partially solved and are made up mainly of β-strands. Here, we demonstrate structural and functional reconstitution of whole HA and present the complete structure of HA of serotype B determined by x-ray crystallography at 3.5 Å resolution. This structure reveals whole HA to be a huge triskelion-shaped molecule. Our results suggest that whole HA is functionally and structurally separable into two parts: HA1, involved in recognition of cell-surface carbohydrates, and HA2-HA3, involved in paracellular barrier disruption by E-cadherin binding."
https://openalex.org/W2131777168,"3-Ketosteroid Δ(1)-dehydrogenases are FAD-dependent enzymes that catalyze the 1,2-desaturation of 3-ketosteroid substrates to initiate degradation of the steroid nucleus. Here we report the 2.0 Å resolution crystal structure of the 56-kDa enzyme from Rhodococcus erythropolis SQ1 (Δ(1)-KSTD1). The enzyme contains two domains: an FAD-binding domain and a catalytic domain, between which the active site is situated as evidenced by the 2.3 Å resolution structure of Δ(1)-KSTD1 in complex with the reaction product 1,4-androstadiene-3,17-dione. The active site contains four key residues: Tyr(119), Tyr(318), Tyr(487), and Gly(491). Modeling of the substrate 4-androstene-3,17-dione at the position of the product revealed its interactions with these residues and the FAD. The C1 and C2 atoms of the substrate are at reaction distance to the N5 atom of the isoalloxazine ring of FAD and the hydroxyl group of Tyr(318), respectively, whereas the C3 carbonyl group is at hydrogen bonding distance from the hydroxyl group of Tyr(487) and the backbone amide of Gly(491). Site-directed mutagenesis of the tyrosines to phenylalanines confirmed their importance for catalysis. The structural features and the kinetic properties of the mutants suggest a catalytic mechanism in which Tyr(487) and Gly(491) work in tandem to promote keto-enol tautomerization and increase the acidity of the C2 hydrogen atoms of the substrate. With assistance of Tyr(119), the general base Tyr(318) abstracts the axial β-hydrogen from C2 as a proton, whereas the FAD accepts the axial α-hydrogen from the C1 atom of the substrate as a hydride ion."
https://openalex.org/W2043640862,"The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs13438494 in intron 24 of PCLO was significantly associated with bipolar disorder in a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies. In this study, we performed functional minigene analysis and bioinformatics prediction of splicing regulatory sequences to characterize the deep intronic SNP rs13438494. We constructed minigenes with A and C alleles containing exon 24, intron 24, and exon 25 of PCLO to assess the genetic effect of rs13438494 on splicing. We found that the C allele of rs13438494 reduces the splicing efficiency of the PCLO minigene. In addition, prediction analysis of enhancer/silencer motifs using the Human Splice Finder web tool indicated that rs13438494 induces the abrogation or creation of such binding sites. Our results indicate that rs13438494 alters splicing efficiency by creating or disrupting a splicing motif, which functions by binding of splicing regulatory proteins, and may ultimately result in bipolar disorder in affected people."
https://openalex.org/W2011116859,"Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) at advanced stage is considered an incurable disease. Despite good response to initial chemotherapy, the responses in SCLC patients with metastatic disease are of short duration and resistance inevitably occurs. Although several target-specific drugs have altered the paradigm of treatment for many other cancers, we have yet to witness a revolution of the same magnitude in SCLC treatment. Anthracyclines, such as doxorubicin, have definite activity in this disease, and ganetespib has shown promising activity in preclinical models but underwhelming activity as a single agent in SCLC patients. Using SCLC cell lines, we demonstrated that ganetespib (IC50: 31 nM) was much more potent than 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG), a geldanamycin derivative (IC50: 16 μM). Ganetespib inhibited SCLC cell growth via induction of persistent G2/M arrest and Caspase 3-dependent cell death. MTS assay revealed that ganetespib synergized with both doxorubicin and etoposide, two topoisomerase II inhibitors commonly used in SCLC chemotherapy. Expression of receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 (RIP1), a protein that may function as a pro-survival scaffold protein or a pro-death kinase in TNFR1-activated cells, was induced by doxorubicin and downregulated by ganetespib. Depletion of RIP1 by either RIP1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) or ganetespib sensitized doxorubicin-induced cell death, suggesting that RIP1 may promote survival in doxorubicin-treated cells and that ganetespib may synergize with doxorubicin in part through the downregulation of RIP1. In comparison to ganetespib or doxorubicin alone, the ganetespib+doxorubicin combination caused significantly more growth regression and death of human SCLC xenografts in immunocompromised mice. We conclude that ganetespib and doxorubicin combination exhibits significant synergy and is efficacious in inhibiting SCLC growth in vitro and in mouse xenograft models. Our preclinical study suggests that ganetespib and doxorubicin combination therapy may be an effective strategy for SCLC treatment, which warrants clinical testing."

Recent studies have suggested that lithium possesses robust neuroprotective and anti-tumor properties. Thus far, a large number of lithium targets have been discovered. Here, we report for the first time that HDAC1 is a target of lithium. Lithium significantly down-regulated HDAC1 at the translational level by targeting HDAC1 mRNA. We also showed that depletion of HDAC1 is essential for the neuroprotective effects of lithium and for the lithium-mediated degradation of mutant huntingtin through the autophagic pathway. Our studies explain the multiple functions of lithium and reveal a novel mechanism for the function of lithium in neurodegeneration."

https://openalex.org/W2051729070,"Biological applications, from genomics to ecology, deal with graphs that represents the structure of interactions. Analyzing such data requires searching for subgraphs in collections of graphs. This task is computationally expensive. Even though multicore architectures, from commodity computers to more advanced symmetric multiprocessing (SMP), offer scalable computing power, currently published software implementations for indexing and graph matching are fundamentally sequential. As a consequence, such software implementations (i) do not fully exploit available parallel computing power and (ii) they do not scale with respect to the size of graphs in the database. We present GRAPES, software for parallel searching on databases of large biological graphs. GRAPES implements a parallel version of well-established graph searching algorithms, and introduces new strategies which naturally lead to a faster parallel searching system especially for large graphs. GRAPES decomposes graphs into subcomponents that can be efficiently searched in parallel. We show the performance of GRAPES on representative biological datasets containing antiviral chemical compounds, DNA, RNA, proteins, protein contact maps and protein interactions networks."
https://openalex.org/W2037463541,"Despite the clinical success of tamoxifen, its resistance remains a major challenge in breast cancer. Here we show that Aurora-A determines tamoxifen sensitivity by regulation of oestrogen receptor (ER)α. Ectopic expression of Aurora-A decreases and depletion of Aurora-A enhances tamoxifen sensitivity in ERα-positive breast cancer. Elevated Aurora-A was significantly associated with the recurrence of ERα-positive tumours. Notably, Aurora-A inhibitor MLN8237, which is currently in clinical trial, synergizes with tamoxifen and overcomes tamoxifen resistance. Furthermore, Aurora-A interacts with and phosphorylates ERα on serine-167 and -305, leading to increase in ERα DNA-binding and transcriptional activity. Elevated levels of Aurora-A are significantly associated with disease-free survival in ERα-positive but not ERα-negative breast cancers. These data suggest that Aurora-A has a pivotal role in tamoxifen resistance and ERα is a bona fide substrate of Aurora-A. Thus, Aurora-A represents a prognostic marker in ERα-positive tumour and a critical therapeutic target in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer, and Aurora-A inhibitor could be used as either an independent or concurrent agent in tamoxifen-resistant tumour."
https://openalex.org/W2036795437,"Bone metastasis of lung adenocarcinoma (AC) is a frequent complication of advanced disease. The purpose of this study was to identify key mediators conferring robust prometastatic activity with clinical significance. We isolated highly metastatic subpopulations (HMS) using a previously described in vivo model of lung AC bone metastasis. We performed transcriptomic profiling of HMS and stringent bioinformatics filtering. Functional validation was assessed by overexpression and lentiviral silencing of single, double and triple combination in vivo and in vitro. We identified HDAC4, PITX1 and ROBO1 that decreased bone metastatic ability after their simultaneous abrogation. These effects were solely linked to defects in osseous colonization. The molecular mechanisms related to bone colonization were mediated by non-cell autonomous effects that include the following: (1) a marked decrease in osteoclastogenic activity in vitro and in vivo, an effect associated with reduced pro-osteoclastogenic cytokines IL-11 and PTHrP expression levels, as well as decreased in vitro expression of stromal rankl in conditions mimicking tumor–stromal interactions; (2) an abrogated response to TGF-β signaling by decreased phosphorylation and levels of Smad2/3 in tumor cells and (3) an impaired metalloproteolytic activity in vitro. Interestingly, coexpression of HDAC4 and PITX1 conferred high prometastatic activity in vivo. Further, levels of both genes correlated with patients at higher risk of metastasis in a clinical lung AC data set and with a poorer clinical outcome. These findings provide functional and clinical evidence that this metastatic subset is an important determinant of osseous colonization. These data suggest novel therapeutic targets to effectively block lung AC bone metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2149805582,"The Wilms’ tumor-1 protein (WT1) is a transcriptional regulator that can either activate or repress genes controlling cell growth, apoptosis and differentiation. The transcriptional corepressor BASP1 interacts with WT1 and mediates WT1’s transcriptional repression activity. BASP1 is contained within large complexes, suggesting that it works in concert with other factors. Here we report that the transcriptional repressor prohibitin is part of the WT1–BASP1 transcriptional repression complex. Prohibitin interacts with BASP1, colocalizes with BASP1 in the nucleus, and is recruited to the promoter region of WT1 target genes to elicit BASP1-dependent transcriptional repression. We demonstrate that prohibitin and BASP1 cooperate to recruit the chromatin remodeling factor BRG1 to WT1-responsive promoters and that this results in the dissociation of CBP from the promoter region of WT1 target genes. As seen with BASP1, prohibitin can associate with phospholipids. We demonstrate that the recruitment of PIP2 and HDAC1 to WT1 target genes is also dependent on the concerted activity of BASP1 and prohibitin. Our findings provide new insights into the function of prohibitin in transcriptional regulation and uncover a BASP1–prohibitin complex that plays an essential role in the PIP2-dependent recruitment of chromatin remodeling activities to the promoter."
https://openalex.org/W1987279602,"Cytosolic proteins containing SH2 and SH3 domains, such as Crk and Crk-like (CrkL), are broadly expressed adapters that interact with a variety of proteins to fulfill key roles in signal transduction pathways triggered by activation of receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinases. Crk and CrkL are similar to each other in structure and biochemical function, although they provide both distinct, as well as overlapping, biological roles during development. We developed a systematic approach to investigate Crk family functions at the cellular level by generating a conditional knock-out system for ablation of Crk and CrkL in cultured fibroblasts. The loss of both Crk and CrkL from fibroblasts resulted in reduced cell surface area and adoption of a rounded, refractile cellular phenotype. These morphological alterations were accompanied by a decrease in focal adhesion sites, reduced actin stress fibers and a collapse of microtubule structures. In addition, cells exhibited decreases in spontaneous motility and wound-healing behavior. Reduced p130Cas phosphorylation and actin levels closely followed the loss of Crk and CrkL, and stabilization of polymerized actin by jasplakinolide suppressed the morphological conversion. Ablation of Crk or CrkL alone conferred a much more modest phenotype suggesting that Crk and CrkL have overlapping functions that are critical for maintaining cell structure. The morphological alterations could be partially rescued by reintroduction of CrkII, and, to a lesser extent, CrkL. Taken together, our results suggest that Crk and CrkL have critical roles in cell structure and motility by maintaining cytoskeletal integrity."
https://openalex.org/W2080730446,"The reaction of the air-tolerant CO dehydrogenase from Oligotropha carboxidovorans with H2 has been examined. Like the Ni-Fe CO dehydrogenase, the enzyme can be reduced by H2 with a limiting rate constant of 5.3 s−1 and a dissociation constant Kd of 525 μm; both kred and kred/Kd, reflecting the breakdown of the Michaelis complex and the reaction of free enzyme with free substrate in the low [S] regime, respectively, are largely pH-independent. During the reaction with H2, a new EPR signal arising from the Mo/Cu-containing active site of the enzyme is observed which is distinct from the signal seen when the enzyme is reduced by CO, with greater g anisotropy and larger hyperfine coupling to the active site 63,65Cu. The signal also exhibits hyperfine coupling to at least two solvent-exchangeable protons of bound substrate that are rapidly exchanged with solvent. Proton coupling is also evident in the EPR signal seen with the dithionite-reduced native enzyme, and this coupling is lost in the presence of bicarbonate. We attribute the coupled protons in the dithionite-reduced enzyme to coordinated water at the copper site in the native enzyme and conclude that bicarbonate is able to displace this water from the copper coordination sphere. On the basis of our results, a mechanism for H2 oxidation is proposed which involves initial binding of H2 to the copper of the binuclear center, displacing the bound water, followed by sequential deprotonation through a copper-hydride intermediate to reduce the binuclear center.

https://openalex.org/W2047980144,"Johne's disease (JD) is a chronic, enteric disease in ruminants caused by Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP). Disease progression follows four distinct stages: silent, subclinical, clinical and advanced. Available diagnostic tests have poor sensitivity and cannot detect early stages of the infection; as a result, only animals in the clinical and advanced stages, which represent the tip of the 'iceberg', are identified through testing. The Iceberg Phenomenon is then applied to provide estimates for JD prevalence. For one animal in the advanced stage, it is assumed that there are one to two in the clinical stage, four to eight in the subclinical stage, and ten to fourteen in the silent stage. These ratios, however, are based on little evidence. To evaluate the ratios, we developed a deterministic ordinary differential equation model of JD transmission and disease progression dynamics. When duration periods associated with the natural course of the disease progression are used, the above ratios do not hold. The ratios used to estimate JD prevalence need to be further investigated."
https://openalex.org/W2104674816,"The role of Ago-1 in microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis has been thoroughly studied, but little is known about its involvement in mitotic cell cycle progression. In this study, we established evidence of the regulatory role of Ago-1 in cell cycle control in association with the G2/M cyclin, cyclin B. Immunostaining of early embryos revealed that the maternal effect gene Ago-1 is essential for proper chromosome segregation, mitotic cell division, and spindle fiber assembly during early embryonic development. Ago-1 mutation resulted in the up-regulation of cyclin B-Cdk1 activity and down-regulation of p53, grp, mei-41, and wee1. The increased expression of cyclin B in Ago-1 mutants caused less stable microtubules and probably does not produce enough force to push the nuclei to the cortex, resulting in a decreased number of pole cells. The role of cyclin B in mitotic defects was further confirmed by suppressing the defects in the presence of one mutant copy of cyclin B. We identified involvement of 2 novel embryonic miRNAs--miR-981 and miR--317-for spatiotemporal regulation of cyclin B. In summary, our results demonstrate that the haploinsufficiency of maternal Ago-1 disrupts mitotic chromosome segregation and spindle fiber assembly via miRNA-guided control during early embryogenesis in Drosophila. The increased expression of cyclin B-Cdk1 and decreased activity of the Cdk1 inhibitor and cell cycle checkpoint proteins (mei-41 and grp) in Ago-1 mutant embryos allow the nuclei to enter into mitosis prematurely, even before completion of DNA replication. Thus, our results have established a novel role of Ago-1 as a regulator of the cell cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2055298183,"Focal adhesions (FAs), sites of tight adhesion to the extracellular matrix, are composed of clusters of transmembrane integrin adhesion receptors and intracellular proteins that link integrins to the actin cytoskeleton and signaling pathways. Two integrin-binding proteins present in FAs, kindlin-1 and kindlin-2, are important for integrin activation, FA formation, and signaling. Migfilin, originally identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen for kindlin-2-interacting proteins, is a LIM domain-containing adaptor protein found in FAs and implicated in control of cell adhesion, spreading, and migration. By binding filamin, migfilin provides a link between kindlin and the actin cytoskeleton. Here, using a combination of kindlin knockdown, biochemical pulldown assays, fluorescence microscopy, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), we have established that the C-terminal LIM domains of migfilin dictate its FA localization, shown that these domains mediate an interaction with kindlin in vitro and in cells, and demonstrated that kindlin is important for normal migfilin dynamics in cells. We also show that when the C-terminal LIM domain region is deleted, then the N-terminal filamin-binding region of the protein, which is capable of targeting migfilin to actin-rich stress fibers, is the predominant driver of migfilin localization. Our work details a correlation between migfilin domains that drive kindlin binding and those that drive FA localization as well as a kindlin dependence on migfilin FA recruitment and mobility. We therefore suggest that the kindlin interaction with migfilin LIM domains drives migfilin FA recruitment, localization, and mobility."
https://openalex.org/W1971232645,"The vertebrate limbs develop through coordinated series of inductive, growth and patterning events. Fibroblast Growth Factor receptor 2b (FGFR2b) signaling controls the induction of the Apical Ectodermal Ridge (AER) but its putative roles in limb outgrowth and patterning, as well as in AER morphology and cell behavior have remained unclear. We have investigated these roles through graded and reversible expression of soluble dominant-negative FGFR2b molecules at various times during mouse limb development, using a doxycycline/transactivator/tet(O)-responsive system. Transient attenuation (≤24 hours) of FGFR2b-ligands signaling at E8.5, prior to limb bud induction, leads mostly to the loss or truncation of proximal skeletal elements with less severe impact on distal elements. Attenuation from E9.5 onwards, however, has an irreversible effect on the stability of the AER, resulting in a progressive loss of distal limb skeletal elements. The primary consequences of FGFR2b-ligands attenuation is a transient loss of cell adhesion and down-regulation of P63, β1-integrin and E-cadherin, and a permanent loss of cellular β-catenin organization and WNT signaling within the AER. Combined, these effects lead to the progressive transformation of the AER cells from pluristratified to squamous epithelial-like cells within 24 hours of doxycycline administration. These findings show that FGFR2b-ligands signaling has critical stage-specific roles in maintaining the AER during limb development."
https://openalex.org/W1982811136,"We showed previously that the small molecule indirubin-3'-monoxime (I3MO) prevents vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation by selectively inhibiting signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). Looking for the underlying upstream molecular mechanism, we here reveal the important role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) for PDGF-induced STAT3 activation in VSMC. We show that neither NADPH-dependent oxidases (Noxes) nor mitochondria, but rather 12/15-lipoxygenase (12/15-LO) are pivotal ROS sources involved in the redox-regulated signal transduction from PDGFR to STAT3. Accordingly, pharmacological and genetic interference with 12/15-LO activity selectively inhibited PDGF-induced Src activation and STAT3 phosphorylation. I3MO is able to blunt PDGF-induced ROS and 15(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15(S)-HETE) production, indicating an inhibitory action of I3MO on 12/15-LO and consequently on STAT3. We identify 12/15-LO as a hitherto unrecognized signaling hub in PDGF-triggered STAT3 activation and show for the first time a negative impact of I3MO on 12/15-LO."
https://openalex.org/W2063051235,"Lymphocyte apoptosis is one reason for immunoparalysis seen in sepsis, although the triggers are unknown. We hypothesized that molecules in plasma, which are up-regulated during sepsis, may be responsible for this. In this study, peripheral lymphocyte apoptosis caused by extracellular histones was confirmed both in mouse and human primary lymphocytes, in which histones induced lymphocyte apoptosis dose-dependently and time-dependently. To identify which intracellular signal pathways were activated, phosphorylation of various mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) were evaluated during this process, and p38 inhibitor (SB203580) was used to confirm the role of p38 in lymphocyte apoptosis induced by histones. To investigate the mitochondrial injury during these processes, we analyzed Bcl2 degradation and Rhodamine 123 to assess mitochondrial-membrane stability, via cyclosporin A as an inhibitor for mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT). Then, caspase 3 activation was also checked by western-blotting. We found that p38 phosphorylation, mitochondrial injury and caspase 3 activation occurred dose-dependently in histones-mediated lymphocyte apoptosis. We also observed that p38 inhibitor SB203580 decreased lymphocyte apoptotic ratio by 49% (P<0.05), and inhibition of MPT protected lymphocytes from apoptosis. Furthermore, to investigate whether histones are responsible for lymphocyte apoptosis, various concentrations of histone H4 neutralization antibodies were co-cultured with human primary lymphocytes and plasma from cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) mice or sham mice. The results showed that H4 neutralization antibody dose-dependently blocked lymphocyte apoptosis caused by septic plasma in vitro. These data demonstrate for the first time that extracellular histones, especially H4, play a vital role in lymphocyte apoptosis during sepsis which is dependent on p38 phosphorylation and mitochondrial permeability transition. Neutralizing H4 can inhibit lymphocyte apoptosis, indicating that it could be a potential target in clinical interventions for sepsis associated immunoparalysis."
https://openalex.org/W2169372453,"Although holoplankton are ocean drifters and exhibit high dispersal potential, a number of studies on single species are finding highly divergent genetic clades. These cryptic species complexes are important to discover and describe, as identification of common marine species is fundamental to understanding ecosystem dynamics. Here we investigate the global diversity within Pleuromamma piseki and P. gracilis, two dominant members of the migratory zooplankton assemblage in subtropical and tropical waters worldwide. Using DNA sequence data from the mitochondrial gene cytochrome c oxidase subunit II (mtCOII) from 522 specimens collected across the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans, we discover twelve well-resolved genetically distinct clades in this species complex (Bayesian posterior probabilities >0.7; 6.3–17% genetic divergence between clades). The morphologically described species P. piseki and P. gracilis did not form monophyletic groups, rather they were distributed throughout the phylogeny and sometimes co-occurred within well-resolved clades: this result suggests that morphological characters currently used for taxonomic identification of P. gracilis and P. piseki may be inaccurate as indicators of species’ boundaries. Cryptic clades within the species complex ranged from being common to rare, and from cosmopolitan to highly restricted in distribution across the global ocean. These novel lineages appear to be ecologically divergent, with distinct biogeographic distributions across varied pelagic habitats. We hypothesize that these mtDNA lineages are distinct species and suggest that resolving their systematic status is important, given the ecological significance of the genus Pleuromamma in subtropical-tropical waters worldwide."
https://openalex.org/W1968294323,"Invasive species, local plant communities and invaded ecosystems change over space and time. Quantifying this change may lead to a better understanding of the ecology and the effective management of invasive species. We used data on density of the highly invasive shrub Lantana camara (lantana) for the period 1990–2008 from a 50 ha permanent plot in a seasonally dry tropical forest of Mudumalai in southern India. We used a cumulative link mixed-effects regression approach to model the transition of lantana from one qualitative density state to another as a function of biotic factors such as indicators of competition from local species (lantana itself, perennial grasses, invasive Chromolaena odorata, the native shrub Helicteres isora and basal area of native trees) and abiotic factors such as fire frequency, inter-annual variability of rainfall and relative soil moisture. The density of lantana increased substantially during the study period. Lantana density was negatively associated with the density of H. isora, positively associated with basal area of native trees, but not affected by the presence of grasses or other invasive species. In the absence of fire, lantana density increased with increasing rainfall. When fires occurred, transitions to higher densities occurred at low rainfall values. In drier regions, lantana changed from low to high density as rainfall increased while in wetter regions of the plot, lantana persisted in the dense category irrespective of rainfall. Lantana seems to effectively utilize resources distributed in space and time to its advantage, thus outcompeting local species and maintaining a population that is not yet self-limiting. High-risk areas and years could potentially be identified based on inferences from this study for facilitating management of lantana in tropical dry forests."

However, the influence of G-CSF on diabetic nephropathy (DN) remains to be examined. In this study, we investigated the effect of G-CSF on DN and its possible mechanisms in a rat model. Methods Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats with early DN were administered G-CSF or saline intraperitoneally. Urine albumin creatinine ratio (UACR), creatinine clearance, mesangial matrix expansion, glomerular basement membrane (GBM) thickness, and podocyte foot process width (FPW) were measured. The levels of interleukin (IL)-1β, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, and type IV collagen genes expression in kidney tissue were also evaluated. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying G-CSF effects, we also assessed the expression of G-CSF receptor (G-CSFR) in glomeruli as well as mobilization of bone marrow (BM) cells to glomeruli using sex-mismatched BM transplantation. Results After four weeks of treatment, UACR was lower in the G-CSF treatment group than in the saline group (p<0.05), as were mesangial matrix expansion, GBM thickness, and FPW (p<0.05). In addition, the expression of TGF-β1 and type IV collagen and IL-1β levels was lower in the G-CSF treatment group (p<0.05). G-CSFR was not present in glomerular cells, and G-CSF treatment increased the number of BM-derived cells in glomeruli (p<0.05). Conclusions G-CSF can prevent the progression of DN in OLETF rats and its effects may be due to mobilization of BM cells rather than being a direct effect."
https://openalex.org/W2004886851,"Background Previous studies have observed an altitude-dependent increase in central apneas and a shift towards lighter sleep at altitudes >4000 m. Whether altitude-dependent changes in the sleep EEG are also prevalent at moderate altitudes of 1600 m and 2600 m remains largely unknown. Furthermore, the relationship between sleep EEG variables and central apneas and oxygen saturation are of great interest to understand the impact of hypoxia at moderate altitude on sleep. Methods Fourty-four healthy men (mean age 25.0±5.5 years) underwent polysomnographic recordings during a baseline night at 490 m and four consecutive nights at 1630 m and 2590 m (two nights each) in a randomized cross-over design. Results Comparison of sleep EEG power density spectra of frontal (F3A2) and central (C3A2) derivations at altitudes compared to baseline revealed that slow-wave activity (SWA, 0.8–4.6 Hz) in non-REM sleep was reduced in an altitude-dependent manner (∼4% at 1630 m and 15% at 2590 m), while theta activity (4.6–8 Hz) was reduced only at the highest altitude (10% at 2590 m). In addition, spindle peak height and frequency showed a modest increase in the second night at 2590 m. SWA and theta activity were also reduced in REM sleep. Correlations between spectral power and central apnea/hypopnea index (AHI), oxygen desaturation index (ODI), and oxygen saturation revealed that distinct frequency bands were correlated with oxygen saturation (6.4–8 Hz and 13–14.4 Hz) and breathing variables (AHI, ODI; 0.8–4.6 Hz). Conclusions The correlation between SWA and AHI/ODI suggests that respiratory disturbances contribute to the reduction in SWA at altitude. Since SWA is a marker of sleep homeostasis, this might be indicative of an inability to efficiently dissipate sleep pressure."
https://openalex.org/W2045091361,"Autotransporters are a superfamily of virulence proteins produced by Gram-negative bacteria. They consist of an N-terminal β-helical domain (""passenger domain"") that is secreted into the extracellular space and a C-terminal β-barrel domain (""β-domain"") that anchors the protein to the outer membrane. Because the periplasm lacks ATP, vectorial folding of the passenger domain in a C-to-N-terminal direction has been proposed to drive the secretion reaction. Consistent with this hypothesis, mutations that disrupt the folding of the C terminus of the passenger domain of the Escherichia coli O157:H7 autotransporter EspP have been shown to cause strong secretion defects. Here, we show that point mutations introduced at specific locations near the middle or N terminus of the EspP β-helix that perturb folding also impair secretion, but to a lesser degree. Surprisingly, we found that even multiple mutations that potentially abolish the stability of several consecutive rungs of the β-helix only moderately reduce secretion efficiency. Although these results provide evidence that the free energy derived from passenger domain folding contributes to secretion efficiency, they also suggest that a significant fraction of the energy required for secretion is derived from another source."

Because a reduction of circulating osteocalcin levels after iron overload have been demonstrated in cell cultures, and osteocalcin is related to glucose and insulin metabolism, the iron-induced osteocalcin reductions could contribute to explain the role of iron metabolism in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Objective To analyzed the associations between serum total and uncarboxylated osteocalcin and adiponectin concentrations with serum ferritin and soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) in elderly subjects. Design We evaluated a total of 423 subjects from the PREDIMED cohort in a population-based cross-sectional analysis. Extensive clinical, nutritional and laboratory measurements, including total and uncarboxylated osteocalcin, adiponectin, ferritin and sTfR were recorded. Results Serum ferritin was positively correlated with increased glucose and insulin circulating levels but also with HOMA-IR, and was inversely associated with total osteocalcin and adiponectin. A regression analysis revealed that serum ferritin and transferrin receptor levels were significantly associated with a decrease in total and uncarboxylated osteocalcin. Serum sTfR levels were associated with lower uncarboxylated osteocalcin levels in the whole-study subjects and remained significant only in the IFG (impaired fasting glucose) individuals. Conclusions We described, for the first time, an inverse association between serum ferritin and sTfR with osteocalcin and extend previous results on adiponectin, thus supporting that factors related to iron metabolism could contribute to the insulin resistance and the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

https://openalex.org/W1989536122,"Merlin, encoded by the Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) gene, is a multifunctional tumor suppressor that integrates and regulates extracellular cues and intracellular signaling pathways, both at the plasma membrane and in the nucleus, to control cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Molecular mechanisms regulating merlin’s tumor-suppressive activity have not been clearly defined. Here we report that merlin can be sumoylated on Lysine residue (K76) in vitro and in vivo. Sumoylation mediates merlin’s intramolecular and intermolecular binding activities and regulates its cytoplasm/nucleus trafficking. Interestingly, sumoylation of merlin is regulated by its phosphorylation via Akt and PAK2 kinases. Mutation of K76 into arginine (R) abolishes its sumoylation, disrupts merlin cortical cytoskeleton residency and attenuates its stability. Using a K76R mutant merlin in a subcutaneous U87MG xenograft model, we demonstrate that merlin sumoylation is required for tumor-suppressive activity. Taken together, our findings indicate that merlin is sumoylated and that this post-translational modification is essential for tumor suppression."

Results The cross-sectional analysis (ANOVA) of n = 398 high performance swimmers showed significant effects for sex, stroke and distance on the IAT, the percentage of personal best time on the IAT (% of PB on IAT) and maximal lactate values (max. bLA). For the freestyle events the IAT decreased, % of PB on IAT and max. bLA increased from 100 to 400 m significantly in men and women. Women showed significantly higher % of PB on IAT with descriptive lower IAT in 7 of 8 analyzed events. Men showed significantly higher max. bLA in 5 of 8 events. In the second step, the analysis of 1902 data sets of these 398 athletes with a multi-level analysis (MLA) showed also significant effects for sex, swimming distance and stroke. For initial status and development over time, the effect sizes for the variables distance and sex were medium to large, whereas for stroke there were no or small effect sizes. Discussion These significant results suggest that lactate tests in swimming specifically have to consider the lactate affecting factors sex and distance under consideration of the time period between measurements. Anthropometrical factors and the physiology of women are possible explanations for the relative better performance for lower lactate concentrations compared to men."
https://openalex.org/W2020054478,"Tropomyosin, a coiled-coil protein that binds along the length of the actin filament, is a universal regulator of the actin cytoskeleton. We have taken a bioinformatics/proteomic approach to studying structure-function relationships in this protein. The presence of a single, essential tropomyosin gene, cdc8, in fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, enables a systems-based approach to define the residues that are important for cellular functions. Using molecular evolution methodologies we identified the most conserved residues and related them to the coiled coil structure. Mutants in which one or more of 21 of the most conserved surface residues was mutated to Ala were tested for the ability to rescue growth of a temperature-sensitive cdc8 mutant when overexpressed at the restrictive temperature. Based on altered morphology of the septum and actin cytoskeleton, we selected three sets of mutations for construction of mutant cdc8 strains using marker reconstitution mutagenesis and analysis of recombinant protein in vitro: D16A.K30A, V114S.E117A.H118A and R121A.D131A.E138A. The mutations have sequence-specific effects on cellular morphology including cell length, organization of cytoskeletal structures (actin patches, actin cables and contractile rings), and in vitro actin affinity, lending credence to the proteomic approach introduced here. We propose that bioinformatics is a valid analysis tool for defining structure-function relationships in conserved proteins in this model organism."

Mathematical modeling of these diseases can help us understand their dynamics and develop more effective control strategies. In this work, we show the capabilities of interior-point methods and nonlinear programming (NLP) formulations to efficiently estimate parameters in multiple discrete-time disease models using measles case count data from three cities. These models include multiplicative measurement noise and incorporate seasonality into multiple model parameters. Our results show that nearly identical patterns are estimated even when assuming seasonality in different model parameters, and that these patterns show strong correlation to school term holidays across very different social settings and holiday schedules. We show that interior-point methods provide a fast and flexible approach to parameterizing models that can be an alternative to more computationally intensive methods."
https://openalex.org/W2086436381,"Visceral fat has a crucial role in the development and progression of cardiovascular disease, the major cause of death in end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Although sagittal abdominal diameter (SAD), as an index of visceral fat, significantly correlated with mortality in the general population, the impact of SAD on clinical outcomes has never been explored in ESRD patients. Therefore, we sought to elucidate the prognostic value of SAD in incident peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients.We prospectively determined SAD by lateral abdominal X-ray at PD initiation, and evaluated the association of SAD with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in 418 incident PD patients.The mean SAD was 24.5 ± 4.3 cm, and during a mean follow-up of 39.4 months, 97 patients (23.2%) died, and 49.4% of them died due to cardiovascular disease. SAD was a significant independent predictor of all-cause [3rd versus 1st tertile, HR (hazard ratio): 3.333, 95% CI (confidence interval): 1.514-7.388, P = 0.01; per 1 cm increase, HR: 1.071, 95% CI: 1.005-1.141, P = 0.03] and cardiovascular mortality (3rd versus 1st tertile, HR: 8.021, 95% CI: 1.994-32.273, P = 0.01; per 1 cm increase, HR: 1.106, 95% CI: 1.007-1.214, P = 0.03). Multivariate fractional polynomial analysis also showed that all-cause and cardiovascular mortality risk increased steadily with higher SAD values. In addition, SAD provided higher predictive value for all-cause (AUC: 0.691 vs. 0.547, P<0.001) and cardiovascular mortality (AUC: 0.644 vs. 0.483, P<0.001) than body mass index (BMI). Subgroup analysis revealed higher SAD (≥ 24.2 cm) was significantly associated with all-cause mortality in men, women, younger patients (<65 years), and patients with lower BMI (<22.3 kg/m(2)).SAD determined by lateral abdominal X-ray at PD initiation was a significant independent predictor of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in incident PD patients. Estimating visceral fat by SAD could be useful to stratify mortality risk in these patients."
https://openalex.org/W2079207327,"Inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate 2-kinase (IPK1) converts inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate(IP5) to inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6). IPK1 shares structural similarity with protein kinases and is suspected to employ a similar mechanism of activation. Previous studies revealed roles for the 1- and 3-phosphates of IP5 in IPK1 activation and revealed that the N-lobe of IPK1 is unstable in the absence of inositol phosphate (IP). Here, we demonstrate the link between IPK1 substrate specificity and the stability of its N-lobe. Limited proteolysis of IPK1 revealed that N-lobe stability is dependent on the presence of the 1-phosphate of the substrate, whereas overall stability of IPK1 was increased in ternary complexes with nucleotide and IPs possessing 1- and 3-phosphates that engage the N-lobe of IPK1. Thus, the 1- and 3-phosphates possess dual roles in both IPK1 activation and IPK1 stability. To test whether kinase stability directly contributed to substrate selectivity of the kinase, we engineered IPK1 mutants with disulfide bonds that artificially stabilized the N-lobe in an IP-independent manner thereby mimicking its substrate-bound state in the absence of IP. IPK1 E82C/S142C exhibited a DTT-sensitive 5-fold increase in kcat for 3,4,5,6-inositol tetrakisphosphate (3,4,5,6-IP4) as compared with wild-type IPK1. The crystal structure of the IPK1 E82C/S142C mutant confirmed the presence of the disulfide bond and revealed a small shift in the N-lobe. Finally, we determined that IPK1 E82C/S142C is substantially more stable than wild-type IPK1 under nonreducing conditions, revealing that increased stability of IPK1 E82C/S142C correlates with changes in substrate specificity by allowing IPs lacking the stabilizing 1-phosphate to be used. Taken together, our results show that IPK1 substrate selection is linked to the ability of each potential substrate to stabilize IPK1.

Recent crystal structures have revealed that some IPKs possess an N- and C-lobed structure similar to that of protein kinases (PKs), in which both lobes contribute to a conserved ATP binding pocket (8Ten Eyck L.F.

Both PKs and IPKs require mechanisms to recognize their physiological substrates from among pools of similar molecules. Although PKs recognize consensus sequences in their targets, IPKs must recognize their substrates from among more than 30 IPs based on differences in stereochemistry and numbers and patterns of phosphate groups (9Ubersax J.A.

This mechanism must be able to differentiate physiological substrates from non-substrates that may differ by the presence, absence, or position of a single phosphate.

The first crystal structures of IPK1 revealed how IP5 is phosphorylated on the 2′-hydroxyl of the inositol ring to yield IP6, but the recognition of all five phosphate groups and the axial hydroxyl group did not offer explanations for how it excludes IPs with fewer than five phosphates from its pool of potential substrates (1Sweetman D.

Comparison of IP-bound and free crystal structures of IPK1 suggested that stabilization of its N-lobe was triggered by IP binding (19Gosein V. Leung T.F. Krajden O. Miller G.J.

Recently, we demonstrated that the positions of the phosphates on IPK1 substrates play different roles in directing IP binding to IPK1 and the recognition of IPs as substrates (20Gosein V. Miller G.J. Roles of phosphate recognition in inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate 2-kinase (IPK1) substrate binding and activation.J. Biol.

The aim of our current work is to define the contributions of IP phosphates on IPK1 stabilization and define how this relates to enzyme activation. The results presented here demonstrate that the stable conformation of IPK1 is achieved when IP binding sites in the N-lobe are occupied by the 1- and 3-phosphates of the IP and that substrate specificity of IPK1 can be manipulated through artificial stabilization of the N-lobe in an IP-independent manner. Inositol phosphates (1,3,4,5,6-IP5; 1,3,4,5-IP4; 1,4,5,6-IP4; 1,3,4,6-IP4; 3,4,5,6-IP4) were purchased from Cayman Chemical Company (Ann Arbor, MI). Trypsin, ADP, and IP6 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. AMPPNP was purchased from Jena Bioscience (Jena, Germany). ATP was purchased from Fisher. All IPs were dissolved in Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) to a stock concentration of 20 mm and stored at −20 °C until use. IPK1 was purified as described previously (19Gosein V. Leung T.F. Krajden O. Miller G.J. Inositol phosphate-induced stabilization of inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate 2-kinase and its role in substrate specificity.Protein Sci. 2012; 21: 737-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Limited proteolysis of IPK1 was performed in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, and 2.5 mm DTT. 9 μm of purified IPK1 was incubated with 2 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm IP (IP4, IP5, or IP6) with and without nucleotides (AMPPNP, ADP) for 20 min at 4 °C. 0.08 μg of trypsin was then added to each reaction, except the undigested control. The reactions were incubated at 20 °C, and samples were taken at 2, 4, 6, and 8 h. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, stained with Coomassie Blue, and analyzed as described by Gosein et al (19Gosein V. Leung T.F. Krajden O. Miller G.J. Inositol phosphate-induced stabilization of inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate 2-kinase and its role in substrate specificity.Protein Sci. 2012; 21: 737-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Densitometry of IPK1 digestion fragments was performed using ImageJ (21Schneider C.A. Rasband W.S. Eliceiri K.W. NIH Image to ImageJ: 25 years of image analysis.Nat. Methods. 2012; 9: 671-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (34949) Google Scholar). The Analyze Gel module was used as described in the ImageJ manual. The area was measured for the uncut control fragment where no digestion had occurred, and for the full-length fragment and fragments comprising amino acids 52–451 and 130–451 bands in digested conditions. The areas of the digested fragments were plotted as a percentage of the area of the control band. DSF was performed on a Corbett Life Science Rotor-Gene 6000. All reactions were prepared individually in 0.2-ml PCR tubes at a final volume of 50 μl. The reactions consisted of 9 μm of purified IPK1 in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, and 2.5 mm DTT buffer, incubated with 1 mm nucleotide (ADP, AMPPNP) and/or 1 mm IP (IP4, IP5, or IP6) for 5 min on ice. SYPRO Orange (Life Technologies) was then added to 5× under dark conditions. The final dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) concentration was 0.1%. A temperature melt was carried out between 28 and 80 °C with 0.15 °C/s increments, and the gain was set to 2. The high resolution melt module was used with an excitation filter of 460 nm and emission filter of 510 nm. Each condition was performed in triplicate. Data were analyzed using the Rotor-Gene software. The first derivative of the raw data was analyzed for peaks, which corresponded to the melting temperature (Tm) of IPK1. DSF was performed similarly using IPK1 E82C/S142C mutant purified in the absence of reducing agents; however, the reactions consisted of IPK1 E82C/S142C incubated with nucleotide and/or IP in the absence or presence of 2.5 mm DTT prior to the DSF run. The structure of IPK1 was processed using the Disulfide by Design software to identify pairs of residues that could be mutated to cysteines to form disulfide bonds (22Dombkowski A.A. Disulfide by Design: a computational method for the rational design of disulfide bonds in proteins.Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 1852-1853Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Cysteine mutants of these residues were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange method (Stratagene) in two subsequent steps. A pET28a vector containing wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana IPK1 and a hexahistidine tag was used a template (a generous gift from Dr. C. A. Brearley). All mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. IPK1 kinase activity was measured using the Kinase-Glo Max luminescent kinase assay (Promega) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Kinase reactions were performed in 25-μl volumes in black 96-well plates at 25 °C and contained 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 6 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, and 300 μm ATP. 0.1 μm of each IPK1 mutant, purified in the absence of reducing agents, was tested with 80 μm IP in the presence or absence of 2.5 mm DTT. 25 μl of Kinase-Glo reagent was added to stop the reaction. Luminescence was measured after 20 min on a Berthold Orion II microplate luminometer. Initially, 80 μm IP was used, and the amount of IPK1 E82C/S142C enzyme was varied to determine conditions in which product formation was linear over 30 min. Subsequently, an array of reactions with varying concentrations of IP (20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, and 140 μm) stopped at various time points (2, 5, 10, 20, and 30 min) was performed in triplicate. The process was performed for both IP5 and 3,4,5,6-IP4, in the absence of reducing agent. The rate of product formation versus IP concentration was plotted and fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation using nonlinear regression to determine Km and Vmax (GraphPad). Values were reported as mean ± S.D. The kcat values were calculated using the equation kcat = Vmax/[E], where [E] is the concentration of enzyme in μm. IPK1 E82C/S142C was expressed and purified as described previously for wild-type IPK1; however, DTT and β-mercaptoethanol were omitted in all buffers (19Gosein V. Leung T.F. Krajden O. Miller G.J.

IPK1 E82C/S142C at 5 mg/ml crystallized with 5 mm ADP/MgCl2, 5 mm IP6 in 0.08 m MES (pH 6.5), 19.85% PEG 3000, 0.17 m NaCl, 2.35% benzamidine HCl at 20 °C within 6–72 h using the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method. X-ray diffraction data were collected on a Rigaku MicroMax-007 HF microfocus x-ray generator fitted with Varimax x-ray optics and a Saturn 944+ CCD detector. Crystals were cryoprotected with reservoir solution that included 10% PEG 400, and data were collected under cryogenic conditions. Diffraction data were analyzed and processed with the HKL2000 software and refined with Phenix and Coot (23Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

Molecular replacement was performed with Protein Data Bank code: 2XAM. All model images were created using PyMOL (27DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. Schrödinger, LLC, New York2010Google Scholar). We used limited proteolysis as a probe for IPK1 stability (19Gosein V. Leung T.F. Krajden O. Miller G.J. Inositol phosphate-induced stabilization of inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate 2-kinase and its role in substrate specificity.Protein Sci. 2012; 21: 737-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). As reported previously (19Gosein V. Leung T.F. Krajden O. Miller G.J. Inositol phosphate-induced stabilization of inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate 2-kinase and its role in substrate specificity.Protein Sci. 2012; 21: 737-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), IPK1 can be cleaved by trypsin at Arg-130 when the N- and C-lobes are not stabilized, but not when the N- and C-lobes have stabilized (Fig. 1A). To identify phosphate groups of the IP substrate that promote IPK1 stabilization, we performed limited proteolysis of IPK1 in complex with IPs alone or in ternary complexes (AMPPNP+IP4, AMPPNP+IP5, or ADP+IP6). The resulting proteolytic patterns observed on SDS gels were compared (Fig. 1B). In contrast to IP alone, IPK1 in complex with both nucleotide and IP protected an additional 46-kDa fragment with Lys-52 at its N terminus, indicating that the Arg-130 site was protected under these conditions (Fig. 1B). To assess the relative stability of IPK1 in the complexes, we performed densitometry to compare the ratios of the stabilized fragments to uncut IPK1 (Fig. 1C). The amounts of full-length fragment in each of the ternary complexes were similar, indicating that digestion occurred to a similar extent in each of these complexes (Fig. 1C, green bars). There was little variability in the amount of the Arg-130-Ser-451 band between the different complexes, indicating that C-lobe stability was very similar in each of the complexes (Fig. 1C, blue bars). Finally, the amount of the Lys-52-Ser-451 band varied between each of the ternary complexes, indicating that IPK1 was differentially stabilized specifically at the N-lobe when IPK1 was bound to different IPs (Fig. 1C, red bars). Protection of the Lys-52 cleavage site is substantially decreased with IPK1 in complex with AMPPNP and 3,4,5,6-IP4 as compared with other ternary complexes, which demonstrates that the 1-phosphate of the IP is singularly important for N-lobe stabilization. To further characterize the overall stability of IPK1, we used DSF to measure the melting point of IPK1 in the ligand-free state, bound to nucleotide (AMPPNP or ADP), bound to IP (IP4s, IP5, or IP6), or as ternary complexes bound to both nucleotide and IP (Fig. 2). In the free state, IPK1 exhibited a Tm of 35 °C. When bound to either AMPPNP or ADP, the Tm of IPK1 increased to 38 °C, indicating that nucleotide contributes to the overall stability of IPK1. When bound to IPs only, except 1,4,5,6-IP4, IPK1 exhibited Tm values of 40 °C, revealing that the stability of IPK1 is impacted more by the binding of IP than nucleotide. Finally, in the ternary complexes, IPK1 exhibited varying Tm values that were dependent on the phosphorylation pattern of the IP. When also bound to nucleotide, IPK1 displayed markedly lower Tm values in the 3,4,5,6-IP4 and 1,4,5,6-IP4 conditions as compared with the 1,3,4,6-IP4, 1,3,4,5-IP4, IP5, and IP6 conditions. Our results indicate that the 1- and 3-phosphate groups contribute more to the overall stability of IPK1 than other phosphates when IPK1 is in the nucleotide-bound state. Observing that binding of different IPs led to differential stabilization of IPK1, we hypothesized that IPK1 stabilized in an IP-independent manner would exhibit altered specificity for IP substrates, diminishing the requirement for N-lobe-interacting 1- and 3-phosphates that stabilize IPK1. To test this role of IPK1 stabilization, we engineered and tested a series of disulfide bonds to artificially stabilize the N-lobe of IPK1. We created double cysteine mutants of IPK1 at different sites near residues 110–140, the region of the N-lobe that was previously observed to be unstable in the absence of IP (19Gosein V. Leung T.F. Krajden O. Miller G.J.

We tested the kinase activity of these mutants using its physiological substrate, IP5, and 3,4,5,6-IP4, a poor IPK1 substrate (20Gosein V. Miller G.J. Roles of phosphate recognition in inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate 2-kinase (IPK1) substrate binding and activation.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 26908-26913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), in reducing and nonreducing conditions (Fig. 3). Wild-type IPK1 displayed very high activity for IP5 and very low activity for 3,4,5,6-IP4 and was unaffected by DTT. The IPK1 E82C/S142C mutant showed moderate activity for IP5 and greater activity for 3,4,5,6-IP4 than the wild-type enzyme under nonreducing conditions, and wild-type activity was restored in the presence of DTT (Fig. 3). This demonstrated the mutations themselves, which are remote from the active site, are not responsible for the altered activity and that the changes were due primarily to the formation of the disulfide bond. To further examine the effect of the disulfide bond on IPK1 kinase activity, we performed a kinetic analysis of IPK1 E82C/S142C with IP5 or 3,4,5,6-IP4, under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 4). IPK1 E82C/S142C exhibited similar Km and kcat values to that of wild-type IPK1 with IP5 as a substrate, both possessing kcat values of ∼44 nmol/min (Table 1). In contrast, IPK1 E82C/S142C displayed a 5-fold increase in kinase activity (kcat = 32.93 nmol/min) with 3,4,5,6-IP4 as a substrate as compared with wild-type IPK1 (kcat = 6.30 nmol/min) (Table 1). The ratio of kcat/Km for the disulfide mutant and wild-type IPK1 for each IP revealed changes in substrate selectivity due to the presence of the disulfide bond. We observed that wild-type IPK1 had a 5.3:1 preference for IP5 over 3,4,5,6-IP4 when comparing IP selectivity. In contrast, IPK1 E82C/S142C displayed a 2.5:1 preference for IP5 over 3,4,5,6-IP4, demonstrating that the disulfide bond altered substrate specificity of IPK1.TABLE 1Kinetic parameters of IPK1 E82C/S142CIPK1IPKmkcatkcat/Kmμmmin−1Wild-type3,4,5,6-IP447.54 ± 13.946.30 ± 0.680.13Wild-type1,3,4,5,6-IP563.05 ± 10.7744.02 ± 3.190.70E82C/S142C3,4,5,6-IP479.17 ± 8.5132.93 ± 1.660.41E82C/S142C1,3,4,5,6-IP544.53 ± 13.4344.18 ± 4.760.99 Open table in a new tab To explore structural changes associated with the introduction of the disulfide bond, we crystallized the disulfide mutant in the presence of ADP and IP6 under nonreducing conditions to obtain a structure of IPK1 E82C/S142C (Fig. 5, Table 2). Overall, the structure of IPK1 E82C/S142C was very similar to wild-type IPK1 (root mean squared deviation = 0.5 Å). The presence of the disulfide bond shifted the N-lobe in the mutant structure as compared with the structure of wild-type IPK1 (Fig. 5A). Inspection of the electron density indicated the presence of the disulfide bond between Cys-82 and Cys-142 (Fig. 5B). To confirm the presence of a disulfide bond between these residues, we generated an omit map lacking the side chains at these residues and observed a large unoccupied density in the Fo − Fc map (σ = 3.0) located between both residues, consistent with the presence of a disulfide bond (Fig. 5C). We performed the same refinement using diffraction data from a wild-type structure of IPK1 (Protein Data Bank code: 3UDZ) and did not observe unoccupied density between the two residues in the Fo − Fc difference map (σ = 3.0), confirming that the density observed is unique to the mutant structure (Fig. 5D).TABLE 2Data collection and refinement statistics for IPK1 E82C/S142C structure.IPK1 E82C/S142C (PDB ID: 4LV7)Data collectionaValues in parentheses are for highest-resolution shell.Space groupP1Cell dimensionsa, b, c (Å)59.76, 59.35, 82.23α, β, γ (°)83.01, 89.91, 63.41Wavelength (Å)1.54178Resolution (Å)50.00-2.60 (2.69-2.60)Rmerge0.086 (0.254)Mean (I/σI)15.4 (4.2)I/σI3.39 (2.51)Completeness (%)94.9 (87.5)Redundancy (%)3.9 (3.8)RefinementResolution (Å)34.55–2.60No. of reflections28,726Rwork/Rfree0.2244/0.2943Ramachandran plot (%)bResidues in the favored/allowed/disallowed regions, as determined by MolProbity.95/4.6/0.4No. of atoms6,380Protein6,250Ligand/ion130Water0B-factors (Å2)Protein33.01Ligand/ion25.54Water0r.m.s.cr.m.s., root mean squared. deviationsBond lengths (Å)0.022Bond angles (°)1.320a Values in parentheses are for highest-resolution shell.b Residues in the favored/allowed/disallowed regions, as determined by MolProbity.c r.m.s., root mean squared. Open table in a new tab To investigate the effect of the disulfide bond on the overall stability of IPK1, we employed DSF to measure the Tm of wild-type IPK1 and IPK1 E82C/S142C. We compared the Tm values of wild-type IPK1 and IPK1 E82C/S142C in the free state, bound to nucleotide (AMPPNP or ADP) or IP (3,4,5,6-IP4, IP5, or IP6), or in ternary complexes bound to both nucleotide and IP (Fig. 6). We performed this experiment under reducing conditions (with DTT) and nonreducing conditions (without DTT) to detect the effect of the disulfide bond. In the presence or absence of DTT, wild-type IPK1 exhibited similar Tm values as noted above, with the lowest Tm in the apo condition, a slight 2 °C increase in Tm when bound to nucleotide only, a moderate 5 °C increase in Tm when bound to IP only, and a large 12 °C increase in the ternary complex with IP5 and IP6 (Fig. 6, first and second sets). AMPPNP + 3,4,5,6-IP4 failed to stabilize IPK1 to the same extent as AMPPNP + IP5 and ADP + IP6 as shown by a 5 °C difference in Tm between the ternary complexes. DTT did not markedly affect any of the Tm values of wild-type IPK1 under any conditions, revealing that the overall stability of wild-type IPK1 is not dependent on disulfide bonds. This is consistent with the structure of wild-type IPK1 that does not have disulfide bonds. In contrast, IPK1 E82C/S142C exhibited an average increase in Tm of 5.6 °C under each condition as compared with wild-type IPK1 in the absence of DTT, and this increase in Tm is reversible in the presence of DTT, confirming that the disulfide bond is increasing the overall stability of IPK1 (Fig. 6, third and fourth sets). In our kinetic studies, we observed that IPK1 E82C/S142C exhibited increased selectivity for 3,4,5,6-IP4 (Table 1). Thus, the engineered disulfide bond that was stabilizing the N-lobe of IPK1 in an IP-independent manner conferred specificity to 3,4,5,6-IP4, a poor substrate that lacks the 1-phosphate that is key for N-lobe stabilization, indicating that the stability of the N-lobe is a determinant for substrate specificity of IPK1. Here, we investigated the role of the IP phosphates in stabilizing IPK1. We determined that the 1-phosphate is important for localized stability of the N-lobe (Fig. 1), consistent with the IP-free crystal structure of IPK1 that revealed localized destabilization of the region surrounding Arg-130, which interacts with the 1-phosphate (19Gosein V. Leung T.F. Krajden O. Miller G.J. Inositol phosphate-induced stabilization of inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate 2-kinase and its role in substrate specificity.Protein Sci. 2012; 21: 737-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). We recently investigated specific roles of phosphate groups in binding and activation of IPK1, and we determined that the 5- and 6-phosphates were important for binding of the IP, whereas the 1- and 3-phosphates were important for activation of IPK1 (20Gosein V. Miller G.J. Roles of phosphate recognition in inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate 2-kinase (IPK1) substrate binding and activation.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 26908-26913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In our current study, we demonstrated that the overall stability of IPK1 is dependent on the N-lobe binding 1- and 3-phosphates (Fig. 2). Thus, the dual roles of the N-lobe binding 1- and 3-phosphates in both IPK1 stabilization and IPK1 activation indicate that the stabilization of the N-lobe is an important component of IPK1 activation. We have also demonstrated that the IP, and not the nucleotide, contributes substantially to the stabilization of the N-lobe of the kinase. This is consistent with our earlier observation that the N-lobe is destabilized in the absence of IP and the structures of Gonzales et al. (15González B. Baños-Sanz J.I. Villate M. Brearley C.A. Sanz-Aparicio J. Inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate 2-kinase is a distant IPK member with a singular inositide binding site for axial 2-OH recognition.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 9608-9613Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), which demonstrated structures bound to IP, but not to nucleotide adopt the stable state (19Gosein V. Leung T.F. Krajden O.

Changes in protease accessibility and increased protein stability upon substrate binding suggested that activation of IPK1 may be linked to the ability of the IP substrate to stabilize IPK1, so we hypothesized that artificial stabilization of the N-lobe of IPK1 in an IP-independent manner would alter the substrate specificity of IPK1. We engineered the IPK1 E82C/S142C disulfide mutant by introducing a cysteine in the N-lobe of IPK1 at a site that is unstable in the IP-free crystal structure and a second cysteine at a site that is well ordered and apparently stable in all IPK1 crystal structures (Fig. 5) (15González B. Baños-Sanz J.I. Villate M. Brearley C.A. Sanz-Aparicio J. Inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate 2-kinase is a distant IPK member with a singular inositide binding site for axial 2-OH recognition.Proc.

By covalently linking stable and unstable regions, we endeavored to stabilize some or all of the N-lobe. This increase in stability was reflected in our DSF data with IPK1 E82C/S142C, which shows increased Tm values under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 6). This mutant also displays increased selectivity for 3,4,5,6-IP4 under nonreducing conditions as compared with wild-type IPK1 (Table 1). Given that 3,4,5,6-IP4 lacks the ability to stabilize wild-type IPK1 as much as IP5 in ternary complexes (Fig. 1), our data collectively show that substrate specificity is linked to N-lobe stability. We recently proposed a model for IP recognition wherein interactions with the IP substrate stabilize the N-lobe and C-lobe to promote kinase activation (19Gosein V. Leung T.F. Krajden O. Miller G.J. Inositol phosphate-induced stabilization of inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate 2-kinase and its role in substrate specificity.Protein Sci. 2012; 21: 737-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In this model, the stable C-lobe recognizes the 4-, 5-, and 6-phosphates of the IP, and the 1- and 3-phosphates of the IP induce N-lobe stabilization. The key interaction between Arg-130 and the 1-phosphate of the IP stabilizes the N-lobe. Thus, our model possesses a triad of elements that are interconnected for IPK1 activity: 1) substrate specificity, 2) stability, and 3) activation. Our current study provides the necessary evidence for the first time to reconcile all three elements and validates our proposed model. We have linked substrate specificity to kinase stability by demonstrating that IPs possessing the 1-phosphate markedly stabilize the N-lobe as compared with 3,4,5,6-IP4, which lacks a 1-phosphate, whereas artificial stabilization of the N-lobe of IPK1 alters substrate specificity. We have also found that the 1- and 3-phosphates of the IP provide increased stability to IPK1, whereas the 5- and 6-phosphates do not affect the overall stability of IPK1, consistent with an unstable N-lobe and a stable C-lobe in the absence of IP. Moreover, previous kinetic studies of IPK1 link substrate specificity to kinase activation (20Gosein V. Miller G.J. Roles of phosphate recognition in inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate 2-kinase (IPK1) substrate binding and activation.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 26908-26913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). We contend that IPK1 stability is linked to IPK1 activation because IPK1 stability correlates with the active state in previous crystal structures (19Gosein V. Leung T.F. Krajden O. Miller G.J. Inositol phosphate-induced stabilization of inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate 2-kinase and its role in substrate specificity.Protein Sci. 2012; 21: 737-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), IPs that display low IPK1 kinase activity (kcat) correlate with a decreased ability to stabilize IPK1 (20Gosein V. Miller G.J. Roles of phosphate recognition in inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate 2-kinase (IPK1) substrate binding and activation.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 26908-26913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), and kinase stability has been validated to be a precursor for activation of PKs, for which IPK1 shares similar features (9Ubersax J.A. Ferrell Jr., J.E. Mechanisms of specificity in protein phosphorylation.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 530-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar, 15González B. Baños-Sanz J.I. Villate M. Brearley C.A. Sanz-Aparicio J. Inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate 2-kinase is a distant IPK member with a singular inositide binding site for axial 2-OH recognition.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 9608-9613Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In short, our current data provide strong evidence to support our model that IPK1 substrate specificity is coupled to IPK1 stability and subsequent activation (Fig. 7). Conformational changes that stabilize links between protein kinase N- and C-lobes that occur during activation have been well documented (9Ubersax J.A. Ferrell Jr., J.E. Mechanisms of specificity in protein phosphorylation.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 530-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar). Stabilization of the kinase structure is promoted by the assembly of a hydrophobic spine spanning the two lobes, one of which consists of the Phe residue from the DFG motif, a hydrophobic residue from the αC helix, and two residues buried in the cores of the N- and C-lobes. This structural spine, called the R-spine, assembles only when the DFG and αC helix regulatory motifs sit in their active conformations (8Ten Eyck L.F. Taylor S.S. Kornev A.P. Conserved spatial patterns across the protein kinase family.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1784: 238-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In IPK1, the αC helix sits at a 46° angle as compared with PKA that precludes the αC helix from contributing a hydrophobic residue to the R-spine (Fig. 8, A and B). Further, the IPK1 DLS motif lacks the large hydrophobic Phe residue, which likely impairs its ability to assemble a stabilizing R-spine (Fig. 8, C and D). These structural differences highlight that IPK1 activation occurs through a different mechanism than found in many PKs. In the proposed model, it is the IP substrate that acts as the bridge between the N-lobe and C-lobe to stabilize the active conformation of the kinase rather than the intrinsic R-spine structure (Fig. 7). The phosphate profile of the IP dictates the ability of the substrate to stabilize the N-lobe of IPK1 and promote kinase activation. This is consistent with previous suggestions that conformational dynamics may play a role in the catalytic cycle of IPK1 (19Gosein V. Leung T.F. Krajden O. Miller G.J. Inositol phosphate-induced stabilization of inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate 2-kinase and its role in substrate specificity.Protein Sci. 2012; 21: 737-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 26Baños-Sanz J.I.

Thus, IPK1 retains important features of PK activation such as N- and C-lobe stabilization, yet distinguishes itself from the PKs. These distinct features could be exploited to selectively inhibit IPK1. In this study, we demonstrate the missing link between IP substrate specificity and the N-lobe stability of IPK1. Our results conclusively support IP-induced stabilization of IPK1 as a proposed model of IP discrimination. IP substrates are very similar, and the elucidation of the unique substrate recognition mechanism of IPK1 among IPKs may provide a basis for selective pharmacological targeting of IPK1. Inhibitors of IPK1 would be useful for ascertaining the functional roles of higher IPs and validation of this IP signaling axis as a therapeutic target."

Among the 27 proteins, 14 were found to be up-regulated and the rest 13 were down-regulated. The identified proteins belonged to five different functional classes: ATP generation, transport and carbohydrate metabolism; protein metabolism; ROS scavenging and detoxifying enzymes; cell wall remodeling and metabolism; transcription, cell cycle and signal transduction. The identification of these differentially expressed proteins and their function could help in analysing the mechanism of lower mutation rate of diploid male gamete when the microsporangium of G. biloba was induced by colchicine."
