https://openalex.org/W2767884883,"This research aims to estimate the relative risks of responsibility for a fatal accident linked to driving under the influence of cannabis or alcohol, the prevalence of these influences among drivers and the corresponding attributable risk ratios. A secondary goal is to estimate the same items for three other groups of illicit drugs (amphetamines, cocaine and opiates), and to compare the results to a similar study carried out in France between 2001 and 2003.Police procedures for fatal accidents in Metropolitan France during 2011 were analyzed and 300 characteristics encoded to provide a database of 4,059 drivers. Information on alcohol and four groups of illicit drugs derived from tests for positivity and potential confirmation through blood analysis. The study compares drivers responsible for causing the accident, that is to say having directly contributed to its occurrence, to drivers involved in an accident for which they were not responsible, and who can be assimilated to drivers in general.The proportion of persons driving under the influence of alcohol is estimated at 2.1% (95% CI: 1.4-2.8) and under the influence of cannabis at 3.4% (2.9%-3.9%). Drivers under the influence of alcohol are 17.8 times (12.1-26.1) more likely to be responsible for a fatal accident, and the proportion of fatal accidents which would be prevented if no drivers ever exceeded the legal limit for alcohol is estimated at 27.7% (26.0%-29.4%). Drivers under the influence of cannabis multiply their risk of being responsible for causing a fatal accident by 1.65 (1.16-2.34), and the proportion of fatal accidents which would be prevented if no drivers ever drove under the influence of cannabis is estimated at 4.2% (3.7%-4.8%). An increased risk linked to opiate use has also been found to be significant, but with low prevalence, requiring caution in interpreting this finding. Other groups of narcotics have even lower prevalence, and the associated extra risks cannot be assessed.Almost a decade separates the present study from a similar one previously conducted in France, and there have been numerous developments in the intervening years. Even so, the prevalence of drivers responsible for causing fatal accidents under the influence of alcohol or narcotics has stayed remarkably stable, as have the proportion of fatal accidents which could in theory be prevented if no drivers ever exceeded the legal limits. The overall number of deaths from traffic accidents has dropped sharply during this period, and the number of victims attributable to alcohol and/or cannabis declined proportionally. Alcohol remains the main problem in France. It is just as important to note that one in two drivers considered to be under the influence of cannabis was also under the influence of alcohol. With risks cumulating between the two, it is particularly important to point out the danger of consuming them together."
https://openalex.org/W2592909217,"Identifying the factors that determine academic performance is an essential part of educational research. Existing research indicates that class attendance is a useful predictor of subsequent course achievements. The majority of the literature is, however, based on surveys and self-reports, methods which have well-known systematic biases that lead to limitations on conclusions and generalizability as well as being costly to implement. Here we propose a novel method for measuring class attendance that overcomes these limitations by using location and bluetooth data collected from smartphone sensors. Based on measured attendance data of nearly 1,000 undergraduate students, we demonstrate that early and consistent class attendance strongly correlates with academic performance. In addition, our novel dataset allows us to determine that attendance among social peers was substantially correlated ($>$0.5), suggesting either an important peer effect or homophily with respect to attendance."
https://openalex.org/W2768091137,"The present longitudinal study examined the reliability of self-reported academic grades across three phases in four subject domains for a sample of 916 high-school students. Self-reported grades were found to be highly positively correlated with actual grades in all academic subjects and across grades 9 to 11 underscoring the reliability of self-reported grades as an achievement indicator. Reliability of self-reported grades was found to differ across subject areas (e.g., mathematics self-reports more reliable than language studies), with a slight yet consistent tendency to over-report achievement levels also observed across grade levels and academic subjects. Overall, the absolute value of over- and underreporting was low and these patterns were not found to differ between mathematics and verbal subjects. In sum, study findings demonstrate the consistent predictive utility of students’ self-reported achievement across grade levels and subject areas with the observed tendency to over-report academic grades and slight differences between domains nonetheless warranting consideration in future education research."
https://openalex.org/W2767819117,"The large patient variability in human physiology and the effects of variables such as exercise or meals challenge current prediction modeling techniques. Physiological models are very precise but they are typically complex and specific physiological knowledge is required. In contrast, data-based models allow the incorporation of additional inputs and accurately capture the relationship between these inputs and the outcome, but at the cost of losing the physiological meaning of the model. In this work, we designed a hybrid approach comprising physiological models for insulin and grammatical evolution, taking into account the clinical harm caused by deviations from the target blood glucose by using a penalizing fitness function based on the Clarke error grid. The prediction models were built using data obtained over 14 days for 100 virtual patients generated by the UVA/Padova T1D simulator. Midterm blood glucose was predicted for the 100 virtual patients using personalized models and different scenarios. The results obtained were promising; an average of 98.31% of the predictions fell in zones A and B of the Clarke error grid. Midterm predictions using personalized models are feasible when the configuration of grammatical evolution explored in this study is used. The study of new alternative models is important to move forward in the development of alarm-and-control applications for the management of type 1 diabetes and the customization of the patient’s treatments. The hybrid approach can be adapted to predict short-term blood glucose values to detect continuous glucose-monitoring sensor errors and to estimate blood glucose values when the continuous glucose-monitoring system fails to provide them."
https://openalex.org/W2767862255,"Background Hypoxia preconditioning has been proven to be an effective method to enhance the therapeutic action of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). However, the beneficial effects of hypoxic MSCs in ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) lung injury have yet to be investigated. In this study, we hypothesized that the administration of hypoxic MSCs would have a positive therapeutic impact on I/R lung injury at molecular, cellular, and functional levels. Methods I/R lung injury was induced in isolated and perfused rat lungs. Hypoxic MSCs were administered in perfusate at a low (2.5×105 cells) and high (1×106 cells) dose. Rats ventilated with a low tidal volume of 6 ml/kg served as controls. Hemodynamics, lung injury indices, inflammatory responses and activation of apoptotic pathways were determined. Results I/R induced permeability pulmonary edema with capillary leakage and increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), pro-inflammatory cytokines, adhesion molecules, cytosolic cytochrome C, and activated MAPK, NF-κB, and apoptotic pathways. The administration of a low dose of hypoxic MSCs effectively attenuated I/R pathologic lung injury score by inhibiting inflammatory responses associated with the generation of ROS and anti-apoptosis effect, however this effect was not observed with a high dose of hypoxic MSCs. Mechanistically, a low dose of hypoxic MSCs down-regulated P38 MAPK and NF-κB signaling but upregulated glutathione, prostaglandin E2, IL-10, mitochondrial cytochrome C and Bcl-2. MSCs infused at a low dose migrated into interstitial and alveolar spaces and bronchial trees, while MSCs infused at a high dose aggregated in the microcirculation and induced pulmonary embolism. Conclusions Hypoxic MSCs can quickly migrate into extravascular lung tissue and adhere to other inflammatory or structure cells and attenuate I/R lung injury through anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic mechanisms. However, the dose of MSCs needs to be optimized to prevent pulmonary embolism and thrombosis."

https://openalex.org/W2768031533,"Oil palm monoculture comprises one of the most financially attractive land-use options in tropical forests, but cropland suitability overlaps the distribution of many highly threatened vertebrate species. We investigated how forest mammals respond to a landscape mosaic, including mature oil palm plantations and primary forest patches in Eastern Amazonia. Using both line-transect censuses (LTC) and camera-trapping (CT), we quantified the general patterns of mammal community structure and attempted to identify both species life-history traits and the environmental and spatial covariates that govern species intolerance to oil palm monoculture. Considering mammal species richness, abundance, and species composition, oil palm plantations were consistently depauperate compared to the adjacent primary forest, but responses differed between functional groups. The degree of forest habitat dependency was a leading trait, determining compositional dissimilarities across habitats. Considering both the LTC and CT data, distance from the forest-plantation interface had a significant effect on mammal assemblages within each habitat type. Approximately 87% of all species detected within oil palm were never farther than 1300 m from the forest edge. Our study clearly reinforces the notion that conventional oil palm plantations are extremely hostile to native tropical forest biodiversity, which does not bode well given prospects for oil palm expansion in both aging and new Amazonian deforestation frontiers."
https://openalex.org/W2767877638,"Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) is the third most widely consumed plant food by humans. Its tubers are rich in starch and vitamin C, but have low or null levels of essential nutrients such as provitamin A and vitamin E. Transformation of potato with a bacterial mini-pathway for β-carotene in a tuber-specific manner results in a “golden” potato (GP) tuber phenotype resulting from accumulation of provitamin A carotenoids (α- and β-carotene) and xanthophylls. Here, we investigated the bioaccessibility of carotenoids and vitamin E as α-tocopherol (αTC) in boiled wild type and golden tubers using in vitro digestion. Golden tubers contained up to 91 μg provitamin A carotenes (PAC)/g D, increased levels of xanthophylls, phytoene and phytofluene, as well as up to 78 μg vitamin E/g DW. Cubes from wild type and GP tubers were boiled and subjected to simulated digestion to estimate bioaccessibility of carotenoids and αTC. Retention in boiled GPs exceeded 80% for β-carotene (βC), α-carotene (αC), lutein, phytoene ± and αTC, but less than 50% for phytofluene. The efficiency of partitioning of total βC, αC, E-lutein, phytoene, phytofluene and αTC in the mixed micelle fraction during small intestinal digestion was influenced by genotype, tuber content and hydrophobicity. Apical uptake of the compounds that partitioned in mixed micelles by monolayers of human intestinal Caco-2 cells during incubation for 4h was 14–20% for provitamin A and xanthophylls, 43–45% for phytoene, 23–27% for phytofluene, and 53% for αTC. These results suggest that a 150 g serving of boiled golden potatoes has the potential to contribute 42% and 23% of the daily requirement of retinol activity equivalents (RAE), as well as 34 and 17% of the daily vitamin E requirement for children and women of reproductive age, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2767718126,"Thermal degradation of insulin complicates its delivery and use. Previous efforts to engineer ultra-stable analogs were confounded by prolonged cellular signaling in vivo, of unclear safety and complicating mealtime therapy. We therefore sought an ultra-stable analog whose potency and duration of action on intravenous bolus injection in diabetic rats are indistinguishable from wild-type (WT) insulin. Here, we describe the structure, function, and stability of such an analog, a 57-residue single-chain insulin (SCI) with multiple acidic substitutions. Cell-based studies revealed native-like signaling properties with negligible mitogenic activity. Its crystal structure, determined as a novel zinc-free hexamer at 2.8 Å, revealed a native insulin fold with incomplete or absent electron density in the C domain; complementary NMR studies are described in the accompanying article. The stability of the analog (ΔGU 5.0(±0.1) kcal/mol at 25 °C) was greater than that of WT insulin (3.3(±0.1) kcal/mol). On gentle agitation, the SCI retained full activity for >140 days at 45 °C and >48 h at 75 °C. These findings indicate that marked resistance to thermal inactivation in vitro is compatible with native duration of activity in vivo. Further, whereas WT insulin forms large and heterogeneous aggregates above the standard 0.6 mm pharmaceutical strength, perturbing the pharmacokinetic properties of concentrated formulations, dynamic light scattering, and size-exclusion chromatography revealed only limited SCI self-assembly and aggregation in the concentration range 1–7 mm. Such a combination of favorable biophysical and biological properties suggests that SCIs could provide a global therapeutic platform without a cold chain.

https://openalex.org/W2767721047,"An important feature of the mammary gland is its ability to undergo profound morphological, physiological, and intracellular changes to establish and maintain secretory function. During this process, key polarity proteins and receptors are recruited to the surface of mammary epithelial cells (MECs), and the vesicle transport system develops and matures. However, the intracellular mechanisms responsible for the development of secretory function in these cells are unclear. The vesicular zinc (Zn2+) transporter ZnT2 is critical for appropriate mammary gland architecture, and ZnT2 deletion is associated with cytoplasmic Zn2+ accumulation, loss of secretory function and lactation failure. The underlying mechanisms are important to understand as numerous mutations and non-synonymous genetic variation in ZnT2 have been detected in women that result in severe Zn2+ deficiency in exclusively breastfed infants. Here we found that ZnT2 deletion in lactating mice and cultured MECs resulted in Zn2+-mediated degradation of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), which impaired intercellular junction formation, prolactin receptor trafficking, and alveolar lumen development. Moreover, ZnT2 directly interacted with vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase), and ZnT2 deletion impaired vesicle biogenesis, acidification, trafficking, and secretion. In summary, our findings indicate that ZnT2 and V-ATPase interact and that this interaction critically mediates polarity establishment, alveolar development, and secretory function in the lactating mammary gland. Our observations implicate disruption in ZnT2 function as a modifier of secretory capacity and lactation performance."
https://openalex.org/W2767831610,"We report five new specimens of xenorophid dolphins from North and South Carolina. Four of the specimens represent the xenorophid Albertocetus meffordorum, previously only known from the holotype skull. The other is a fragmentary petrosal from the upper Oligocene Belgrade Formation that we refer to Echovenator sp, indicating at least two xenorophids from that unit. Two of the Albertocetus meffordorum specimens are from the lower Oligocene Ashley Formation: 1) a partial skeleton with neurocranium, fragmentary mandible, ribs, vertebrae, and chevrons, and 2) an isolated braincase. The partial vertebral column indicates that Albertocetus retained the ancestral morphology and locomotory capabilities of basilosaurid archaeocetes, toothed mysticetes, and physeteroids, and caudal vertebrae that are as wide as tall suggest that the caudal peduncle, which occurs in all extant Cetacea, was either wide or lacking. CT data from the isolated braincase were used to generate a digital endocast of the cranial cavity. The estimated EQ of this specimen is relatively high for an Oligocene odontocete, and other aspects of the brain, such as its anteroposterior length and relative size of the temporal lobe, are intermediate in morphology between those of extant cetaceans and terrestrial artiodactyls. Ethmoturbinals are also preserved, and are similar in morphology and number to those described for the Miocene odontocete Squalodon. These fossils extend the temporal range of Albertocetus meffordorum into the early Oligocene, its geographic range into South Carolina, and expand our paleobiological understanding of the Xenorophidae."
https://openalex.org/W2767759039,"Background Effective vaccination communication with parents is critical in efforts to overcome barriers to childhood vaccination, tackle vaccine hesitancy and improve vaccination coverage. Health workers should be able to provide information to parents and other caregivers and support them in reaching decisions about vaccinating their children. Limited information exists regarding the perceptions of caregivers and health workers on the vaccination communication strategies employed in Nigeria. This study, which forms part of the ‘Communicate to vaccinate’ (COMMVAC) project, aims to explore the perceptions and experiences of caregivers and health workers in Nigeria on vaccination communication strategies implemented in their settings. Methodology We conducted the study in two States: Bauchi in Northern Nigeria and Cross River in the south. We carried out observations (n = 40), in-depth interviews (n = 14) and focus group discussions (FGDs) (n = 12) amongst 14 purposively selected health workers, two community leaders and 84 caregivers in the two states. We transcribed data verbatim and analysed the data using a framework analysis approach. Results Caregivers were informed about vaccination activities through three main sources: health facilities (during health education sessions conducted at antenatal or immunization clinics); media outlets; and announcements (in churches/mosques, communities and markets). Caregivers reported that the information received was very useful. Their preferred sources of information included phone text messages, town announcers, media and church/mosque announcements. Some caregivers perceived the clinic environment, long waiting times and health worker attitudes as barriers to receiving vaccination information.When delivering communication interventions, health workers described issues tied to poor communication skills; poor motivation; and attitudes of community members, including vaccine resistance. Conclusion Communication about vaccination involves more than the message but is also influenced by the environment and the attitudes of the deliverer and receiver. It is pertinent for health policy makers and programme managers to understand these factors so as to effectively implement communication approaches."
https://openalex.org/W2767466714,"The attenuating effects of green tea supplements (GTS) against the ultraviolet (UV) radiation induced skin damages are distinguished. However, the concomitant effects of GTS on the large intestinal microbiomes and associated metabolomes are largely unclear. Herein, we performed an integrated microbiome-metabolome analysis to uncover the esoteric links between gut microbiome and exo/endogenous metabolome maneuvered in the large intestine of UVB-exposed mice subjected to dietary GTS. In UVB-exposed mice groups (UVB), class Bacilli and order Bifidobacteriales were observed as discriminant taxa with decreased lysophospholipid levels compared to the unexposed mice groups subjected to normal diet (NOR). Conversely, in GTS fed UVB-exposed mice (U+GTS), the gut-microbiome diversity was greatly enhanced with enrichment in the classes, Clostridia and Erysipelotrichia, as well as genera, Allobaculum and Lachnoclostridium. Additionally, the gut endogenous metabolomes changed with an increase in amino acids, fatty acids, lipids, and bile acids contents coupled with a decrease in nucleobases and carbohydrate levels. The altered metabolomes exhibited high correlations with GTS enriched intestinal microflora. Intriguingly, the various conjugates of green tea catechins viz., sulfated, glucuronided, and methylated ones including their exogenous derivatives were detected from large intestinal contents and liver samples. Hence, we conjecture that the metabolic conversions for the molecular components in GTS strongly influenced the gut micro-environment in UVB-exposed mice groups, ergo modulate their gut-microbiome as well as exo/endogenous metabolomes."
https://openalex.org/W2767412516,"To examine the relationship between spending on electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) and disease symptoms compared with the relationship between 30-day e-cigarette use and disease symptoms among adult cigarette smokers in the U.S.We analyzed data from the Tobacco and Attitudes Beliefs Survey which included 533 respondents aged 24+ who were current cigarette smokers and e-cigarette ever users. Fifteen self-reported disease symptoms were included as outcome variables. Separate multivariable logistic regression models were estimated for each disease symptom with total spending on e-cigarettes in the past 30 days and with reported 30-day e-cigarette use. All models controlled for cigarettes smoked per day (CPD) and sociodemographic characteristics.We found that those who spent more on e-cigarettes were more likely to report chest pain (AOR = 1.25, 95% CI 1.02-1.52), to notice blood when brushing their teeth (AOR = 1.23, 95% CI 1.02-1.49), to have sores or ulcers in their mouth (AOR = 1.36, 95% CI 1.08-1.72), and to have more than one cold (AOR = 1.36, 95% CI 1.05-1.78) than those with no spending on e-cigarettes in the past 30 days in an adjusted analysis. After controlling for CPD and other covariates, there were no significant relationships between 30-day e-cigarette use and symptoms. Even after controlling for CPD, e-cigarette expenditures or use was associated with greater odds of wheezing and shortness of breath.E-cigarette expenditures might be a more useful measure of intensity of e-cigarette use. The additional health effect of e-cigarette use or expenditures among smokers independent of the effect of CPD suggests that e-cigarette use adds adverse health effects even among cigarette smokers."
https://openalex.org/W2767697681,"Tissues of symbiotic Cnidarians are exposed to wide, rapid and daily variations of oxygen concentration. Indeed, during daytime, intracellular O2 concentration increases due to symbiont photosynthesis, while during night, respiration of both host cells and symbionts leads to intra-tissue hypoxia. The Hypoxia Inducible Factor 1 (HIF-1) is a heterodimeric transcription factor used for maintenance of oxygen homeostasis and adaptation to hypoxia. Here, we carried out a mechanistic study of the response to variations of O2 concentrations of the coral model Stylophora pistillata. In silico analysis showed that homologs of HIF-1 α (SpiHIF-1α) and HIF-1β (SpiHIF-1β) exist in coral. A specific SpiHIF-1 DNA binding on mammalian Hypoxia Response Element (HRE) sequences was shown in extracts from coral exposed to dark conditions. Then, we cloned the coral HIF-1α and β genes and determined their expression and transcriptional activity. Although HIF-1α has an incomplete Oxygen-dependent Degradation Domain (ODD) relative to its human homolog, its protein level is increased under hypoxia when tested in mammalian cells. Moreover, co-transfection of SpiHIF-1α and β in mammalian cells stimulated an artificial promoter containing HRE only in hypoxic conditions. This study shows the strong conservation of molecular mechanisms involved in adaptation to O2 concentration between Cnidarians and Mammals whose ancestors diverged about 1,200-1,500 million years ago."
https://openalex.org/W2767843201,"Although leishmaniases are responsible for high morbidity and mortality all over the world, no really satisfying treatment exists. Furthermore, the corresponding parasite Leishmania undergoes a very characteristic form of programmed cell death. Indeed, different stimuli can induce morphological and biochemical apoptotic-like features. However, the key proteins involved in mammal apoptosis, such as caspases and death receptors, are not encoded in the genome of this parasite. Currently, little is known about Leishmania apoptosis, notably owing to the lack of specific tools for programmed cell death analysis in these parasites. Furthermore, there is a need for a better understanding of Leishmania programmed cell death in order (i) to better understand the role of apoptosis in unicellular organisms, (ii) to better understand apoptosis in general through the study of an ancestral eukaryote, and (iii) to identify new therapeutic targets against leishmaniases. To advance understanding of apoptosis in Leishmania, in this study we developed a new tool based on the quantification of calcein and propidium iodide by flow cytometry. This double labeling can be employed to distinguish early apoptosis, late apoptosis and necrosis in Leishmania live cells with a very simple and rapid assay. This paper should, therefore, be of interest for people working on Leishmania and related parasites."
https://openalex.org/W2767744222,"Postoperative residual tumor is the major prognostic factor in ovarian cancer. The feasibility of complete cytoreductive surgery is assessed by laparoscopy. Our goal was to develop a predictive score prior to laparoscopy to evaluate the feasibility of complete cytoreductive surgery in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer.We developed a score to predict incomplete cytoreductive surgery by performing multiple logistic regressions after bootstrap procedures on data from a retrospective cohort of 247 patients with advanced ovarian cancer. This score was validated on a different population of 45 patients with ovarian cancer.Four criteria were independently associated with incomplete cytoreduction, confirmed by surgery: BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 3.07; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.0-9.6), CA125 > 100 IU/L (aOR, 3.99; 95% CI, 1.6-10.1), diaphragmatic and/or omental carcinomatosis by CT-Scan (aOR, 5.82; 95% CI, 2.6-13.1), and positive parenchymal metastases by PET/CT (aOR, 3.59; 95% CI, 1.0-12.8). The 100-point score was based on these criteria. The area-under-the-curve of the score was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.73-0.86). In the validation group, no patient ranked in the high-risk group of incomplete cytoreductive surgery had a complete upfront cytoreductive surgery (95% CI 0-16). Three of 29 patients for whom primary complete cytoreduction was not possible were classified in the group at low risk of incomplete cytoreductive surgery (12%; 95% CI 4-27).This pre-operative score may be useful for distinguishing which patients may have complete cytoreductive surgery from those who will receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy, while avoiding unnecessary laparoscopy."
https://openalex.org/W2767784239,"Vestibular disorders, by inducing significant posturo-locomotor and cognitive disorders, can significantly impair the most basic tasks of everyday life. Their precise diagnosis is essential to implement appropriate therapeutic countermeasures. Monitoring their evolution is also very important to validate or, on the contrary, to adapt the undertaken therapeutic actions. To date, the diagnosis methods of posturo-locomotor impairments are restricted to examinations that most often lack sensitivity and precision. In the present work we studied the alterations of the dynamic weight distribution in a rodent model of sudden and complete unilateral vestibular loss. We used a system of force sensors connected to a data analysis system to quantify in real time and in an automated way the weight bearing of the animal on the ground. We show here that sudden, unilateral, complete and permanent loss of the vestibular inputs causes a severe alteration of the dynamic ground weight distribution of vestibulo lesioned rodents. Characteristics of alterations in the dynamic weight distribution vary over time and follow the sequence of appearance and disappearance of the various symptoms that compose the vestibular syndrome. This study reveals for the first time that dynamic weight bearing is a very sensitive parameter for evaluating posturo-locomotor function impairment. Associated with more classical vestibular examinations, this paradigm can considerably enrich the methods for assessing and monitoring vestibular disorders. Systematic application of this type of evaluation to the dizzy or unstable patient could improve the detection of vestibular deficits and allow predicting better their impact on posture and walk. Thus it could also allow a better follow-up of the therapeutic approaches for rehabilitating gait and balance."
https://openalex.org/W2768053242,"Environmental exposures to essential and toxic elements may alter health trajectories, depending on the timing, intensity, and mixture of exposures. In epidemiologic studies, these factors are typically analyzed as a function of elemental concentrations in biological matrices measured at one or more points in time. Such an approach, however, fails to account for the temporal cyclicity in the metabolism of environmental chemicals, which if perturbed may lead to adverse health outcomes. Here, we conceptualize and apply a non-linear method-recurrence quantification analysis (RQA)-to quantify cyclical components of prenatal and early postnatal exposure profiles for elements essential to normal development, including Zn, Mn, Mg, and Ca, and elements associated with deleterious health effects or narrow tolerance ranges, including Pb, As, and Cr. We found robust evidence of cyclical patterns in the metabolic profiles of nutrient elements, which we validated against randomized twin-surrogate time-series, and further found that nutrient dynamical properties differ from those of Cr, As, and Pb. Furthermore, we extended this approach to provide a novel method of quantifying dynamic interactions between two environmental exposures. To achieve this, we used cross-recurrence quantification analysis (CRQA), and found that elemental nutrient-nutrient interactions differed from those involving toxicants. These rhythmic regulatory interactions, which we characterize in two geographically distinct cohorts, have not previously been uncovered using traditional regression-based approaches, and may provide a critical unit of analysis for environmental and dietary exposures in epidemiological studies."

https://openalex.org/W2767264339,"Introduction Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is associated to an increased prevalence of Metabolic Syndrome (MeS) and to a reduction of Quality of Life (QoL). The aim of this study is to evaluate the association between MeS and QoL in SLE. Methods SLE patients were consecutively enrolled in a cross sectional study. MeS was defined according to IFD definition. Therapy with glucocorticoids (GC) and antimalarial was analyzed as cumulative years of exposure. We used a cut off of 7.5 mg of prednisone to define high daily dose of GC. QoL was quantified using SF-36. We used BDI and HAM-H to assess symptoms of mood disorders. Fatigue was evaluated using Facit-Fatigue, physical activity using IPAQ, sleep quality using PSQI and alexithymia using TAS-20. Results We enrolled 100 SLE patients. MeS prevalence was 34%. Patients with MeS presented reduced scores in SF-36 MCS and PCS compared to patients without MeS (p 0.03 and p 0.004). BDI and HAM-H score were significantly higher in patients meeting MeS criteria compared to subjects without MeS (p 0.004, p 0.02). These results were confirmed after adjustment for confounders. Compared to patients without MeS, those with MeS presented higher age, lower education level, higher recent SELENA-SLEDAI, higher number of flares, increased SDI, longer cumulative exposure to high dose GC and shorter duration of antimalarial therapy. In the multiple logistic regression model, the variable associated to the Odds Ratio of having MeS were: the average of recent SELENA-SLEDAI (OR 1.15 p 0.04), the years of exposure to high dose of GC (OR 1.18 p 0.004), the years of exposure to antimalarials (OR 0.82 p 0.03) and the BDI score (OR 1.1 p 0.005). Conclusion A modern management of SLE should not miss to take all the possible measures to ensure an adequate QoL to SLE patients, with particular attention to those affected by MeS."
https://openalex.org/W2767792893,"Background Temporal characterisation of physical activity in children is required for effective strategies to increase physical activity (PA). Evidence regarding determinants of physical activity in childhood and their time-dependent patterns remain inconclusive. We used functional data analysis (FDA) to model temporal profiles of daily activity, measured objectively using accelerometers, to identify diurnal and seasonal PA patterns in a nationally representative sample of primary school-aged UK children. We hypothesised that PA levels would be lower in girls than boys at play times and after school, higher in children participating in social forms of exercise (such as sport or play), and lower among those not walking to school. Methods Children participating in the UK-wide Millennium Cohort Study wore an Actigraph GT1M accelerometer for seven consecutive days during waking hours. We modelled 6,497 daily PA profiles from singleton children (3,176 boys; mean age: 7.5 years) by means of splines, and used functional analysis of variance to examine the cross-sectional relation of time and place of measurement, demographic and behavioural characteristics to smoothed PA profiles. Results Diurnal and time-specific patterns of activity showed significant variation by sex, ethnicity, UK country and season of measurement; girls were markedly less active than boys during school break times than boys, and children of Indian ethnicity were significantly less active during school hours (9:30–12:00). Social activities such as sport clubs, playing with friends were associated with higher level of PA in afternoon (15:00–17:30) and early evenings (17:30–19:30). Lower PA levels between 8:30–9:30 and 17:30–19:30 were associated with mode of travel to and from school, and number of cars in regular use in the household. Conclusion Diminished PA in primary school aged children is temporally patterned and related to modifiable behavioural factors. FDA can be used to inform and evaluate public health policies to promote childhood PA."
https://openalex.org/W2767880338,"Family studies have shown a strong heritability component for venous thromboembolism (VTE), but established genetic risk factors are present in only half of VTE patients.To identify genetic risk factors in two large families with unexplained hereditary VTE.We performed whole exome sequencing in 10 affected relatives of two unrelated families with an unexplained tendency for VTE. We prioritized variants shared by all affected relatives from both families, and evaluated these in the remaining affected and unaffected individuals. We prioritized variants based on 3 different filter strategies: variants within candidate genes, rare variants across the exome, and SNPs present in patients with familial VTE and with low frequency in the general population. We used whole exome sequencing data available from 96 unrelated VTE cases with a positive family history of VTE from an affected sib study (the GIFT study) to identify additional carriers and compared the risk-allele frequencies with the general population. Variants found in only one individual were also retained for further analysis. Finally, we assessed the association of these variants with VTE in a population-based case-control study (the MEGA study) with 4,291 cases and 4,866 controls.Six variants remained as putative disease-risk candidates. These variants are located in 6 genes spread among 3 different loci: 2p21 (PLEKHH2 NM_172069:c.3105T>C, LRPPRC rs372371276, SRBD1 rs34959371), 5q35.2 (UNC5A NM_133369.2:c.1869+23C>A), and 17q25.1 (GPRC5C rs142232982, RAB37 rs556450784). In GIFT, additional carriers were identified only for the variants located in the 2p21 locus. In MEGA, additional carriers for several of these variants were identified in both cases and controls, without a difference in prevalence; no carrier of the UNC5A variant was present.Despite sequencing of several individuals from two thrombophilic families resulting in 6 candidate variants, we were unable to confirm their relevance as novel thrombophilic defects."

Methods After injecting 25.6 ± 8.8 MBq (0.7 ± 0.2 mCi) of 18F-Fluoro-L-DOPA intravenously, three static PET scans were acquired at 20, 30, and 40 min post injection in 3-D mode on 10 patients (6 male, 4 female) with congenital hyperinsulinism. Regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn over several organs visible in the reconstructed PET/CT images and time activity curves (TACs) were generated. Residence times were calculated using the TAC data. The radiation absorbed dose for the whole body was calculated by entering the residence times in the OLINDA/EXM 1.0 software. Results The mean residence times for the 18F-Fluoro-L-DOPA in the liver, lungs, kidneys, muscles, and pancreas were 11.54 ± 2.84, 1.25 ± 0.38, 4.65 ± 0.97, 17.13 ± 2.62, and 0.89 ± 0.34 min, respectively. The mean effective dose equivalent for 18F-Fluoro-L-DOPA was 0.40 ± 0.04 mSv/MBq. The CT scan used for attenuation correction delivered an additional radiation dose of 5.7 mSv. The organs receiving the highest radiation absorbed dose from 18F-Fluoro-L-DOPA were the urinary bladder wall (2.76 ± 0.95 mGy/MBq), pancreas (0.87 ± 0.30 mGy/MBq), liver (0.34 ± 0.07 mGy/MBq), and kidneys (0.61 ± 0.11 mGy/MBq). The renal system was the primary route for the radioactivity clearance and excretion. Conclusions The estimated radiation dose burden from 18F-Fluoro-L-DOPA is relatively modest to newborns."
https://openalex.org/W2767544865,"The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP) is the largest network of marine reserves in the world, yet little is known of the efficacy of no-fishing zones in the relatively lightly-exploited remote parts of the system (i.e., northern regions). Here, we find that the detection of reserve effects is challenging and that heterogeneity in benthic habitat composition, specifically branching coral cover, is one of the strongest driving forces of fish assemblages. As expected, the biomass of targeted fish species was generally greater (up to 5-fold) in no-take zones than in fished zones, but we found no differences between the two forms of no-take zone: ‘no-take’ versus ‘no-entry’. Strong effects of zoning were detected in the remote Far-North inshore reefs and more central outer reefs, but surprisingly fishing effects were absent in the less remote southern locations. Moreover, the biomass of highly targeted species was nearly 2-fold greater in fished areas of the Far-North than in any reserve (no-take or no-entry) further south. Despite high spatial variability in fish biomass, our results suggest that fishing pressure is greater in southern areas and that poaching within reserves may be common. Our results also suggest that fishers ‘fish the line’ as stock sizes in exploited areas decreased near larger no-take zones. Interestingly, an analysis of zoning effects on small, non-targeted fishes appeared to suggest a top-down effect from mesopredators, but was instead explained by variability in benthic composition. Thus, we demonstrate the importance of including appropriate covariates when testing for evidence of trophic cascades and reserve successes or failures."

https://openalex.org/W2767838781,"Virulence of Clostridium difficile is primarily attributed to the large clostridial toxins A and B while the role of binary toxin (CDT) remains unclear. The prevalence of human strains of C. difficile possessing only CDT genes (A−B−CDT+) is generally low (< 5%), however, this genotype is commonly found in neonatal livestock both in Australia and elsewhere. Zoonotic transmission of C. difficile has been suggested previously. Most human diagnostic tests will not detect A−B−CDT+ strains of C. difficile because they focus on detection of toxin A and/or B. We performed a prospective investigation into the prevalence and genetic characteristics of A−B−CDT+ C. difficile in symptomatic humans. All glutamate dehydrogenase or toxin B gene positive faecal specimens from symptomatic inpatients over 30 days (n = 43) were cultured by enrichment, and C. difficile PCR ribotypes (RTs) and toxin gene profiles determined. From 39 culture-positive specimens, 43 C. difficile isolates were recovered, including two A−B−CDT+ isolates. This corresponded to an A−B−CDT+ prevalence of 2/35 (5.7%) isolates possessing at least one toxin, 2/10 (20%) A−B− isolates, 2/3 CDT+ isolates and 1/28 (3.6%) presumed true CDI cases. No link to Australian livestock-associated C. difficile was found. Neither A−B−CDT+ isolate was the predominant A−B−CDT+ strain found in Australia, RT 033, nor did they belong to toxinotype XI. Previous reports infrequently describe A−B−CDT+ C. difficile in patients and strain collections but the prevalence of human A−B−CDT+ C. difficile is rarely investigated. This study highlights the occurrence of A−B−CDT+ strains of C. difficile in symptomatic patients, warranting further investigations of its role in human infection."
https://openalex.org/W2768075758,"Domain-minimized insulin receptors (IRs) have enabled crystallographic analysis of insulin-bound micro-receptors. In such structures, the C-terminal segment of the insulin B chain inserts between conserved IR domains, unmasking an invariant receptor-binding surface that spans both insulin A and B chains. This conformation not only rationalizes the inactivity of single-chain insulin (SCI) analogs (in which the A and B chains are directly linked), but also suggests that connecting (C) domains of sufficient length will bind the IR. Here, we report the high-resolution solution structure and dynamics of such an active SCI. The hormone's closed-to-open transition is foreshadowed by segmental flexibility in the native state as probed by heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy and multiple conformer simulations of crystallographic protomers as described in the companion article. We propose a model of the SCI's IR-bound state based on molecular-dynamics simulations of a micro-receptor complex. In this model, a loop defined by the SCI's B and C domains encircles the C-terminal segment of the IR α-subunit. This binding mode predicts a conformational transition between an ultra-stable closed state (in the free hormone) and an active open state (on receptor binding). Optimization of this switch within an ultra-stable SCI promises to circumvent insulin's complex global cold chain. The analog's biphasic activity, which serendipitously resembles current premixed formulations of soluble insulin and microcrystalline suspension, may be of particular utility in the developing world."
https://openalex.org/W2767564657,"Gene expression DNA microarrays have been vital for characterizing whole-genome transcriptional profiles. Nevertheless, their effectiveness relies heavily on the accuracy of genome sequences, the annotation of gene structures, and the sequence-dependent performance of individual probes. Currently available gene expression arrays for the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum rely on an average of 2 probes per gene, usually positioned near the 3' end of genes; consequently, existing designs are prone to measurement bias and cannot capture complexities such as the occurrence of transcript isoforms arising from alternative splicing or alternative start/ stop sites. Here, we describe two novel gene expression arrays with exon-focused probes designed with an average of 12 and 20 probes spanning each gene. This high probe density minimizes signal noise inherent in probe-to-probe sequence-dependent hybridization intensity. We demonstrate that these exon arrays accurately profile genome-wide expression, comparing favorably to currently available arrays and RNA-seq profiling, and can detect alternatively spliced transcript isoforms as well as non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). Of the 964 candidate alternate splicing events from published RNA-seq studies, 162 are confirmed using the exon array. Furthermore, the exon array predicted 330 previously unidentified alternate splicing events. Gene expression microarrays continue to offer a cost-effective alternative to RNA-seq for the simultaneous monitoring of gene expression and alternative splicing events. Microarrays may even be preferred in some cases due to their affordability and the rapid turn-around of results when hundreds of samples are required for fine-scale systems biology investigations, including the monitoring of the networks of gene co-expression in the emergence of drug resistance."

Krill were collected 14-29 May 2013 using a macrozooplankton trawl. Biomass of both species combined was significantly higher in the southwest than in north and east. M. norvegica clearly dominated in Atlantic waters, whereas T. inermis was more evenly distributed around the island, while the highest values were also observed in the southwest for this species. Simple linear regressions showed that the abundance of M. norvegica was positively related to temperature, salinity and phytoplankton concentration, while the abundance of T. inermis was negatively related to bathymetry. Multiple linear regression analyses did not add to this information of a positive relationship between abundance and temperature for M. norvegica, while T. inermis was shown to be negatively related to both temperature and bathymetry. During the latter half of May, the main spawning of both species was confined to the regions off the southwest coast. Sex ratio (males/females) of M. norvegica was higher in the southwest than in the north and east, whereas T. inermis showed a similar sex ratio all around the island. In all regions, M. norvegica appears to have a lifespan of 2 years while T. inermis of 1 year in the southwest and possibly 2 years in north and east."
https://openalex.org/W2767655953,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most prevalent sexually transmitted infection, affecting an estimated 11% of the world’s population. The high-risk HPV types (HR HPV) account for approximately 5% of the global burden of cancer and thus cause high morbidity and mortality. Although it is known that persistent infection with HR HPV is the greatest risk factor for developing HPV-associated cancer, and that the HPV early proteins E6 and E7 dysregulate immune detection by its host cells, the mechanisms of immune evasion by HR HPV are not well understood. Previous work in the laboratory identified the endogenous cytoplasmic host protein NFX1-123 as a binding partner of the HR HPV type 16 oncoprotein E6 (16E6). Together NFX1-123 and 16E6 affect cellular growth, differentiation, and immortalization genes and pathways. In a whole genome microarray, human foreskin keratinocytes (HFKs) stably expressing 16E6 and overexpressing NFX1-123 showed a diverse set of innate immune genes downregulated two-fold or more when compared to 16E6 cells with endogenous NFX1-123. We demonstrated that 16E6 and NFX1-123 decreased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in 16E6 HFKs at the mRNA and protein level. Knock down of NFX1-123 in 16E6 HFKs resulted in a derepression of innate immune genes, pointing to the requirement of NFX1-123 for immune regulation in the context of 16E6. Studies using immunofluorescent microscopy revealed that 16E6 and NFX1-123 disturbed the normal localization of signaling proteins involved in initiating the immune response. This study identifies NFX1-123 as a critical host protein partner through which 16E6 is able to subvert the immune response and in turn permit a long-lived HR HPV infection."

The availability of several NB genomic profiles improves the prognostic ability, but the outcome prediction for this pathology remains imperfect. We previously produced a novel prognostic gene signature based on the response of NB cells to hypoxia, a condition of tumor microenvironment strictly connected with cancer aggressiveness. Here we attempted to further define the expression of hypoxia-modulated specific genes, looking at their protein level in NB specimens, considering in particular the hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), the mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1), and the HIF-prolyl hydroxylase domain 3 (PHD3). The evaluation of expression was performed by Western blot and immunocytochemistry on NB cell lines and by immunohistochemistry on tumor specimens. Stimulation of both HIF-1α and PDK1 and inhibition of PHD3 expression were observed in NB cell lines cultured under prolonged hypoxic conditions as well as in most of the tumors with poor outcome. Our results indicate that the immunohistochemistry analysis of the protein expression of PDK1, PHD3, and HIF-1α defines the hypoxic status of NB tumors and can be used as a simple and relevant tool to stratify high-risk patients."
https://openalex.org/W2767725080,"Plants have evolved developmental mechanisms to ensure reproduction when in sub-optimal local environments. The shade-avoidance syndrome is one such mechanism that causes plants to elongate and accelerate flowering. Plants sense shade via the decreased red:far-red (R:FR) ratio that occurs in shade. We explored natural variation in flowering behavior caused by a decrease in the R:FR ratio of Arabidopsis thaliana accessions. A survey of accessions revealed that most exhibit a vigorous rapid-flowering response in a FR-enriched environment. However, a subset of accessions appeared to be compromised in the accelerated-flowering component of the shade-avoidance response. The genetic basis of the muted response to FR enrichment was studied in three accessions (Fl-1, Hau-0, and Mir-0). For all three accessions, the reduced FR flowering-time effect mapped to the FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) region, and the FT alleles from these accessions are expressed at a lower level in FR-enriched light compared to alleles from accessions that respond robustly to FR enrichment. In the Mir-0 accession, a second genomic region, which includes CONSTANTS (CO), also influenced flowering in FR-enriched conditions. We have demonstrated that variation in the degree of precocious flowering in shaded conditions (low R:FR ratio) results from allelic variation at FT."
https://openalex.org/W2768053914,"Studies have shown large variation of referral probabilities in different countries, and many influencing factors have been described. This variation is most likely explained by different healthcare systems, particularly to which extent primary care physicians (PCPs) act as gatekeepers. In Switzerland no mandatory gatekeeping system exists, however insurance companies offer voluntary managed care plans with reduced insurance premiums. We aimed at investigating the role of managed care plans as a potential referral determinant in a non-gatekeeping healthcare system. We conducted a cross-sectional study with 90 PCPs collecting data on consultations and referrals in 2012/2013. During each consultation up to six reasons for encounters (RFE) were documented. For each RFE PCPs indicated whether a referral was initiated. Determinants for referrals were analyzed by hierarchical logistic regression, taking the potential cluster effect of the PCP into account. To further investigate the independent association of the managed care plan with the referral probability, a hierarchical multivariate logistic regression model was applied, taking into account all available data potentially affecting the referring decision. PCPs collected data on 24'774 patients with 42'890 RFE, of which 2427 led to a referral. 37.5% of patients were insured in managed health care plans. Univariate analysis showed significant higher referral rates of patients with managed care plans (10.7% vs. 8.5%). The difference in referral probability remained significant after controlling for other confounders in the hierarchical multivariate regression model (OR 1.355). Patients in managed care plans were more likely to be referred than patients without such a model. These data contradict the argument that patients in managed care plans have limited healthcare access, but underline the central role of PCPs as coordinator of care."

https://openalex.org/W2767757747,"In animal contests, communicating aggressive motivation is most often mediated by visual or acoustic signals, while chemical signals are not expected to serve such a function since they are less able to be modulated by the sender during the changing behavioral context. We describe a rare example of ephemeral olfactory signals in terrestrial animals, signals that are emitted via protrusive scent glands in male cave crickets Troglophilus neglectus (Orthoptera, Rhaphidophoridae) to reflect the state of the signaler's aggression. We correlate the intensity of behaviorally expressed aggression of the individuals in dyadic contests with the frequency and extent of their gland tissue protrusion, the latter serving as an indication of the amount of released odor. We detected large amounts of odor release during brief gland protrusions, and the absence of its release during gland retraction. Males protruded the glands during and after encountering a rival, with the degree of protrusion increasing with the intensity of the signalers' aggression. During the encounters, the degree of gland protrusion increased most strongly with the occurrence of the elevated body posture, directly preceding the attack. This degree was significantly higher in encounter winners than in losers displaying such posture, suggesting the highly important role of the released odor for contest resolution. After the encounters, glands were protruded almost exclusively by winners, apparently announcing victory. We tested for the function of the olfactory signals also directly, by preventing gland tissue protrusion in symmetric and asymmetric treatments of the contestants. Treating only the dominant individuals decreased the percentage of encounters they won by over 60%, while treating both contestants elicited a significant increase in the frequency and duration of fights. During contests, the olfactory signals of T. neglectus apparently function as a highly effective threat, which prevents maximal contest escalation and decreases the conflict-related costs."

Human beliefs are central to drivers of emerging zoonoses, yet little is known about how people make inferences about risk in such scenarios. We present an inductive account of zoonosis risk perception, suggesting that beliefs about the range of animals able to transmit diseases to each other influence how people generalize risks to other animals and health behaviors. Consistent with our account, in Study 1, we find that participants who endorse higher likelihoods of cross-species disease transmission have stronger intentions to report animal bites. In Study 2, using real-world descriptions of Ebola virus from the WHO and CDC, we find that communications conveying a broader range of animals as susceptible to the virus increase intentions to report animal bites and decrease perceived safety of wild game meat. These results suggest that inductive reasoning principles may be harnessed to modulate zoonosis risk perception and combat emerging infectious diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2767371338,"Purpose The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical feasibility of spectral analyses using dual-layer detector spectral computed tomography (CT) in acute intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH). Material and methods We retrospectively reviewed patients with acute ICH who underwent CT angiography on a dual-layer detector spectral CT scanner. A spectral data analysis was performed to detect contrast enhancement in or adjacent to acute ICH by using spectral image reconstructions including monoenergetic (MonoE), virtual noncontrast (VNC), and iodine overlay fusion images. We also acquired a spectral plot to assess material differentiation within lesions. Results Among the 30 patients, the most common cause of acute ICH was chronic hypertension (18/30, 60%) followed by trauma (5/30, 16.7%), brain tumour (3/30, 10%), Moyamoya disease (2/30, 6.7%), and haemorrhagic diathesis from anticoagulation therapy (2/30, 6.7%). Of 30 patients, 13 showed suboptimal iodine suppression in the subcalvarial spaces on VNC images compared with true noncontrast images. The CT angiographic spot sign within the acute ICH was detected in four patients (4/30, 13.3%). All three tumours were metastatic and included lung cancer (n = 2) and hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 1) which showed conspicuous delineation of an enhancing tumour portion in the spectral analysis. Spectral analyses allowed the discrimination of acute haemorrhage and iodine with enhanced lesion visualization on the MonoE images obtained at lower keVs (less than 70 keV) and spectral plot. Conclusions Even though the image quality of VNC is perceived to be inferior, it is feasible to evaluate acute ICH in clinical settings using dual-layer detector spectral CT. The MonoE images taken at lower keVs were useful for depicting contrast enhancing lesion, and spectral plot might be helpful for material differentiation in patients with acute ICH."

We used the ecosystem model known as the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) to estimate NPP of semiarid grassland in northern China counties between 2001 and 2013. Model estimates were strongly linearly correlated with observed values from different counties (slope = 0.76 (p < 0.001), intercept = 34.7 (p < 0.01), R2 = 0.67, RMSE = 35 g C·m-2·year-1, bias = -0.11 g C·m-2·year-1). We also quantified inter-annual changes in NPP over the 13-year study period. NPP varied between 141 and 313 g C·m-2·year-1, with a mean of 240 g C·m-2·year-1. NPP increased from west to east each year, and mean precipitation in each county was significantly positively correlated with NPP-annually, and in summer and autumn. Mean precipitation was positively related to NPP in spring, but not significantly so. Annual and summer temperatures were mostly negatively correlated with NPP, but temperature was positively correlated with spring and autumn NPP. Spatial correlation and partial correlation analyses at the pixel scale confirmed precipitation is a major driver of NPP. Temperature was negatively correlated with NPP in 99% of the regions at the annual scale, but after removing the effect of precipitation, temperature was positively correlated with the NPP in 77% of the regions. Our data show that temperature effects on production depend heavily on recent precipitation. Results reported here have significant and far-reaching implications for natural resource management, given the enormous size of these grasslands and the numbers of people dependent on them."

Aging and inactivity cause atrophy and weakness of the muscle, leading to a loss of the heart-assisting role. An electrical lower limb muscle stimulator can prevent atrophy and weakness more effectively than conventional resistance training; however, it has been reported to increase the heart's pumping workload in some situations. Therefore, more effective tools should be developed.We newly developed a cardiac cycle-synchronized electrical lower limb muscle stimulator by combining a commercially available electrocardiogram monitor and belt electrode skeletal muscle electrical stimulator, making it possible to achieve strong and wide but not painful muscle contractions. Then, we tested the stimulator in 11 healthy volunteers to determine whether the special equipment enabled lower limb muscle training without harming the hemodynamics using plethysmography and a percutaneous cardiac output analyzer.In 9 of 11 subjects, the stimulator generated diastolic augmentation waves on the dicrotic notches and end-diastolic pressure reduction waves on the plethysmogram waveforms of the brachial artery, showing analogous waveforms in the intra-aortic balloon pumping heart-assisting therapy. The heart rate, stroke volume, and cardiac output significantly increased during the stimulation. There was no change in the systolic or diastolic blood pressure during the stimulation.Cardiac cycle-synchronized electrical muscle stimulation for the lower limbs may enable muscle training without harmfully influencing the hemodynamics and with a potential to reduce the heart's pumping workload, suggesting a promising tool for effectively treating both locomotor and cardiovascular disorders."

The aim of this study was to determine whether the anti-inflammatory action of icilin could potentially be used to treat autoimmune neuroinflammatory disorders, such as multiple sclerosis (MS). During experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE)—a CD4+ T cell-driven murine model of MS—we found that both wild-type (WT) and TRPM8-deficient EAE mice were protected from disease progression during icilin treatment, as evidenced by delays in clinical onset and reductions in neuroinflammation. In vitro, icilin potently inhibited the proliferation of murine and human CD4+ T cells, with the peripheral expansion of autoantigen-restricted T cells similarly diminished by the administration of icilin in mice. Attenuation of both TRPM8–/– and TRP ankyrin-1–/– T-cell proliferation by icilin was consistent with the WT phenotype, which suggests a mechanism that is independent of these channels. In addition, icilin treatment altered the expressional profile of activated CD4+ T cells to one that was indicative of restricted effector function and limited neuroinflammatory potential. These findings identify a potent antiinflammatory role for icilin in lymphocyte-mediated neuroinflammation and highlight clear pleiotropic effects of the compound beyond classic TRP channel activation.—Ewanchuk, B.

Using in vitro chemoresponse assay, we compared the chemosensitivity according to RS in these patients. METHOD Among the patients with Oncotype Dx assay, we identified 63 patients who had chemotherapy response assays to doxorubicin based on adenosine triphosphate. The degree of chemosensitivity to doxorubicin was translated into the cell death rate (CDR). The RS was also dichotomized with a cutoff of 26. RESULTS Of 63 patients, 34 (54%), 17 (27%), and 12 patients (19%) had a low, intermediate, and high RS, respectively. The mean CDR differed significantly according to categorized RS, with 17.3±10.8 in the low RS group vs. 23.6±16.3 in the intermediate RS group vs. 28.8±12.6 in the high RS group (P = 0.024, One-way ANOVA test). The mean CDR was significantly higher in the higher RS (26≥) group compared with the lower RS ( 30) group compared with the low RS (<18) group (P = 0.012, the Student's t-test). Also, continuous RS and CDR correlated positively (Pearson's R = 0.337; P = 0.007). High RS demonstrated the odds ratio (OR = 26.33; 95% CI = 1.69-410.0) for predicting tumors with chemosensitivity on the multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS The chemosensitivity measured by in vitro chemoresponse assay was different according to the RS.

The time frame of data sets is divided into two periods: before 2011 (i.e., T1) and after 2011 (i.e., T2). Through quadratic assignment procedure analysis, we found that some authors have ABC or AC relationships (i.e., potential communication relationship, PCR) but do not have actual collaborations or direct citations (i.e., actual communication relationship, ACR) among them. In addition, we noticed that PCR and AKC are highly correlated and that the old PCR and the new ACR are correlated and consistent. Such facts indicate that PCR tends to produce academic exchanges based on similar themes, and ABC bears more advantages in predicting potential relations. Based on tripartite citation analysis, including AC, ABC, and ADC, we also present an author-relation mining process. Such process can be used to detect deep and potential author relationships. We analyze the prediction capacity by comparing between the T1 and T2 periods, which demonstrate that relation mining can be complementary in identifying authors based on similar themes and discovering more potential collaborations and academic communities."

https://openalex.org/W2767797407,"Structured management programmes deliver optimized care in heart failure patients and improve outcome. We examined the feasibility of including patients with migration background speaking little or no German in a heart failure management programme.After adaption of script material and staff to Turkish language we aimed to recruit 300 Turkish and 300 German (control group) patients within 18 months using the operational basis of a local heart failure management programme for screening, contact and inclusion. Of 488 and 1,055 eligible Turkish and German patients identified through screening, 165 Turkish (34%) and 335 German (32%) patients consented on participation (p = 0.46). General practitioners contributed significantly more of the Turkish (84%) than of the German patients (16%, p<0.001). Contact attempts by programme staff were significantly less successful in Turkish (52%) than in German patients (60%, p = 0.005) due to significantly higher rate of missing phone numbers (36% vs 25%), invalid address data (28% vs 7%) and being unreachable by phone more frequently (39% vs 26%, all p<0.001). Consent rate was significantly higher in successfully contacted Turkish (63%) compared to German patients (50%, p<0.001).The inclusion of Turkish minority patients into a heart failure management programme is feasible with higher consent rate than in Germans. However, effort is high due to inherent logistic adaptions and barriers in identification and contacting of patients.DRKS00007780."
