https://openalex.org/W1989128016,"Analyses for manganese, nickel, iron, cobalt, sodium, and lithium in the interstitial water of cores from the southern California borderland and six deep-sea cores in the area of the East Pacific Rise show great variation in concentration of trace elements. Oxidizing near-shore sediments showed a 50-fold enrichment in manganese in contrast to sulfide-rich reducing sediments, which showed no enrichment. Deep-sea sediments were variable in their concentration of the trace metals. All but one core showed a high enrichment in dissolved manganese, with a maximum of 6.6 parts per million. Two cores showed a 100-fold enrichment in nickel and cobalt. The manganese appears to be in solution either as Mn(2+) or as a complex. The results appear to support manganese nodule formation in deep-sea sediments through a diffusion of manganese from depth to the surface."
https://openalex.org/W2068181264,"The widespread occurrence of sedimentary phosphate in argillaceous sediments provides the basis for a new method of paleosalinity estimation. Sedimentary phosphate contains iron- and calcium-phosphate fractions, the relative proportions of which are sensitive to salinity of the water at sites of deposition. The sedimentary phosphate method provides direct estimates of paleosalinity throughout the freshwater to marine range."
https://openalex.org/W1984275918,Recent development of a microelectrode has enabled the first continuous recording of the pH of the secretion of the normally functioning accessory boring organ of the shell-boring predatory snail Urosalpinx. The recording was made in an incomplete borehole in a glass-shell model. The minimum pH recorded was 3.8; hitherto the secretion had been considered neutral.
https://openalex.org/W2070867865,"A new mineral, stanfieldite, Ca(4)(Mg,Fe)(5)(PO(4))(6), has been found in the Estherville mesosiderite and several pallasites: Santa Rosalia, Albin, Finmarken, Imilac, Mount Vernon, and Newport. The atom ratio Mg:Fe of this mineral varies from 1.5 in Estherville to a constant ratio of about 15 in the pallasites. X-ray, optical, and chemical data for the mineral resemble those for the only intermediate compound in the system Mg(3)(PO(4))(2)-Ca(3)(PO(4))(2)."
https://openalex.org/W2063034286,The characteristic blue color of the mineral kyanite is shown to be caused by traces of Ti(+++) in the range of a few parts per million. Evidence from the intensity and position of optical absorption bands indicates that the unusually intense color probably arises from electron delocalization into narrow d-bands.

https://openalex.org/W2033911268,"Faunal changes observed in association with reversals of the geomagnetic field have been attributed to increased radiation dosages produced by cosmic rays when the field intensity is greatly reduced. However, at currently observed cosmic ray and solar particle intensities, the additional dosages produced at sea level during a period of complete removal of the geomagnetic field are negligible. Furthermore, even complete dumping of the energetic particle in the radiation belts would not give rise to the necessary increased dosages."

https://openalex.org/W2073349538,"In stellar astronomy, the future of automation techniques lies in their application to the largest telescopes. In such a case, the cost of automation is small compared to that of the telescope project as a whole, and is well repaid in the savings in observing time. A ""stand-alone"" capability for manual operation in event of computer breakdown is usually provided for systems like this; an example is the 107-inch (272-cm) telescope under construction at the McDonald Observatory of the University of Texas, which will be associated with an IBM 1800 computer."

X-ray diffraction studies of the tridymite indicate that it has a disordered structure in which hexagonal close packing predominates. The specimens, which contain trace amounts of aluminum, iron, and other elements, are soft and fibrous, varying from white to shades of brown."
