https://openalex.org/W1600283399,"Addition of membrane vesicles prepared from the electric organ of Torpedo californica to the aqueous phase of a planar phospholipid bilayer system results in a large (up to 3 orders of magnitude) stepwise increase in membrane conductance. This increased conductance consists of two components: an ohmic background leak and a voltage-dependent, ideally anion-selective conductance. The anion conductance is low at voltages greater than +10 mV, rises sharply as the voltage becomes negative, and then saturates as the voltage becomes highly negative. (The trans side of the bilayer, to which vesicles are not added, is defined as ground.) Under high amplification, the anion conductance shows single channel behavior with a voltage-independent, single channel conductance of 13.9 +/- 0.1 pmho in 0.1 M Cl-. Furthermore, the anion channel, but not the background conductance, is inhibited by submillimolar concentrations of SITS and DIDS, two well known anion transport inhibitors. The inhibition is seen only when SITS or DIDS is added to the cis side. No cholinergic agents tested have any effect on the channel."

https://openalex.org/W1570941153,"Insulin regulation of lipoprotein lipase was studied in fully differentiated 3T3-Ll fat cells. Insulin at low concentrations (10e7 to 10-l’ M) elicited a rapid and maximal increase (-lo-fold) in lipoprotein lipase release from the cells to the medium within 30 min and caused a 2to lo-fold increase in total cellular lipoprotein lipase activity over a a-day period. Insulin had no effect on cell lipoprotein lipase activity during the first 4 h of treatment. Prolonged exposure to insulin (% to 4 days) resulted in additional increases in enzyme release rate, and increased the fractional release rate per h approximately lo-fold. Stimulation of cellular lipoprotein lipase activity was dependent on the presence of glucose in the incubation medium. Although half-maximal increases in cell activity required 12 h of insulin treatment in glucose-containing medium, removal of either glucose or insulin resulted in loss of more than 50% of the stimulation in enzyme activity within 90 min. Addition of glucose to cells incubated 20 h with insulin in carbohydrate-free medium elicited a rapid and full response to insulin in 2 h. Fructose, mannose, and glucosamine could substitute for glucose in supporting this rapid response in insulin-pretreated cells, but only glucose, mannose, and fructose would support the effect in 24-h incubations with hormone. Induction of the increase in lipoprotein lipase activity by glucose in insulin-pretreated cells was prevented by cycloheximide, but not by actinomycin D. In contrast, inhibitors of either protein (cycloheximide, puromycin) or RNA (a-amanitin, actinomycin D) synthesis completely blocked the response when added with insulin to cells incubated in medium containing glucose. We propose that insulin regulates lipoprotein lipase in fat cells by three major actions: 1) it elicits a rapid release of enzyme from the cell through mechanisms which are independent of energy metabolism and protein synthesis; 2) it stimulates gene expression and synthesis of RNA independently of effects on hexose and amino acid transport; 3) it stimulates expression of the nuclear effects of the hormone at the translational level by increasing hexose uptake and the levels of regulatory glycolytic metabolites within the cells. Induction of the enzyme and its release thus appear"

The bulk of base exchange reaction enzymes remained firmly bound to the particulate fraction under these conditions. The phospholipase D specific activity was enriched 240-fold by a purification protocol employing ammonium sulfate precipitation, and both Sepharose 4B and DEAE-cellulose column chromatography. The approximate molecular weight of the partially purified enzyme was calculated to be 200,000 based upon the elution profile from Sepharose 4B and Sephadex G-200 columns. The optimum pH was 6.0, and Km values for phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine were 0.75 mM and 0.91 mM, respectively. The enzyme activity was not dependent on the presence of divalent cation although Ca2+ and Fe2+ showed stimulatory effects."
https://openalex.org/W1570642136,"Colchicine.tubulin complex (CD) inhibits microtubule assembly. We examined this inhibition under conditions where spontaneous nucleation was suppressed and assembly was restricted to an elongation polymerization. We found that CD inhibited assembly by a mechanism which preserved the ability of microtubule ends to add tubulin. This observation is inconsistent with the end-poisoning model which recently was proposed as a general mechanism for assembly inhibition by CD. Our data are consistent with the following model: (a) microtubules formed in the presence of CD are CD-tubulin copolymers; (b) these copolymers can have appreciable numbers of incorporated CDs which are, most likely, randomly distributed in the copolymers; (c) CD-tubulin copolymers have assembly-competent ends with association and dissociation rate constants which decrease as the CD/tubulin ratio in the copolymers, (CD/T)MT, increases; and (d) the critical tubulin concentrations required for microtubule assembly increase in the presence of CD, indicating that copolymer affinity for tubulin decreases as (CD/T)MT increases."
https://openalex.org/W1594784426,"Platelet plasma membrane vesicles accumulate 5-hy- droxytryptamine in response to a gradient of NaCl (out > in). Although potassium ion is not required for this process, a K’ concentration gradient (in > out) elevates the steady state level of 5-hydroxytryptamine accu- mulation 5-fold. Transport is independent of the gen- eration of an electrical potential (interior negative) across the vesicle membrane when K’ is present inter- nally, but in its absence 5-hydroxytryptamine trans- port is apparently electrogenic, with net positive charge crossing the membrane with 5-hydroxytrypt- amine. Potassium ion directly interacts with the 5-hy- droxytryptamine transporter as evidenced by its ef- fects on the initial rate of 5-hydroxytryptamine trans- port. Internal K+ stimulates influx and external K’ inhibits. Even in the absence of a K’ gradient, K’ affects the kinetics of 5-hydroxytryptamine transport, 30 meq of K’/liter increasing the V,,,,, for 5-hydroxy- tryptamine transport 3-fold and increasing K,,, by 2- fold. The unidirectional efflux of [3H]5-hydroxytrypt- amine is stimulated by both K’ and unlabeled 5-hy- droxytryptamine in the external medium. Although 5- hydroxytryptamine-stimulated efflux requires external Na+, K’-induced efflux is independent of external Na’. A mechanism consistent with the above observations is proposed in which internal K+ accelerates the influx of 5-hydroxytryptamine by increasing the rate at which the 5-hydroxytryptamine binding site of the trans- porter “moves” from the internal surface of the mem- brane to the external surface. Concomitant with this movement, one potassium ion is transported from the vesicle lumen to the external medium. Blood platelets accumulate 5-hydroxytryptamine by a proc- ess which is believed to be similar, if not identical, to the reuptake of Shydroxytryptamine by serotonergic neurons (1, 2). In both cases, transport is an energy-dependent carrier- mediated process with an absolute requirement for Na’ and Cl- in the external medium (3-10). Plasma membrane vesicles isolated from platelets provide a useful model system for the"

The kinetic properties of alpha-amino[1-14C]isobutyric acid (AIB) transport were investigated in isolated hepatocytes following stimulation by either hormone in vitro. In nonhormonally treated cells (i.e. basal state), saturable transport occurred mainly through a low affinity (Km approximately equal to 40 mM) component. In insulin or glucagon-treated hepatocytes, saturable transport occurred through both a low affinity component (similar to that observed in the basal state) and a high affinity (Km approximately equal to 1 mM) component. At low AIB concentrations (less than 0.5 mM), insulin and glucagon at maximally stimulating doses increased AIB uptake about 2-fold and 5-fold, respectively. The high affinity component induced by either hormone exhibited the properties of the A (alanine preferring) mediation of amino acid transport. This component required 2 to 3 h for maximal expression, and its emergence was completely prevented by cycloheximide. Half-maximal stimulation was elicited by insulin at about 3 nM and by glucagon at about 1 nM. Dibutyryl cyclic AMP mimicked the glucagon effect and was not additive to it at maximal stimulation. Maximal effects of insulin and glucagon, or insulin and dibutyryl cyclic AMP, were additive. We conclude that insulin and glucagon can modulate amino acid entry in hepatocytes through the synthesis of a high affinity transport component."

https://openalex.org/W1605590412,"The topology of the steroid hydroxylase complexes in bovine adrenocortical mitochondria were studied by using controlled digestion with trypsin of purified inner mitochondrial membranes. Inhibition of steroid hydroxylase activity by trypsin was only observed in inner mitochondrial membranes which had been disrupted by various techniques. The steroid hydroxylase activity of intact inner membranes was not inhibited by trypsin. The effect of tryptic digestion was monitored by measuring 11 beta-hydroxylase and cholesterol side chain cleavage activities, as well as cytochrome P-450 reduction. The effect of trypsin on the steroid-induced difference spectra using pregnenolone, 20 alpha-hydroxycholesterol, and deoxycorticosterone was also measured. The results were similar regardless of which procedure was utilized and strongly suggest that both cytochrome P-45011 beta and cytochrome P-450scc are located on the matrix side of the mitochondrial inner membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1568811076,"The main purpose of this study was to describe the influence of lecithin upon lipolysis of mixed monomolecular films of trioctanoylglycerol/didodecanoylphosphatidycholine by pancreatic lipase in order to mimic some physiological situations. The quantity of enzyme adsorbed to the interface was simultaneously determined using 5-thio-2-nitro[14C]benzoyl lipase. Lipolytic activity was enhanced 3- to 4-fold in the presence of colipase, an effect which is attributed to increased enzyme turnover number. When a pure triglyceride film was progressively diluted with lecithin, the minimum specific activity of lipase exhibited a bell-shaped curve: a mixed film containing only 20% trioctanoylglycerol was hydrolyzed at the same rate as a monolayer of pure triglyceride."

https://openalex.org/W1516746187,"Previous work suggested that hormonal activation of adenylate cyclase involves the introduction of GTP to the regulatory site, and subsequent hydrolysis of the bound GTP terminates the activation. In many tissues the turn-off GTPase reaction cannot be readily measured because of a high background of nonspecific GTP hydrolysis. To circumvent this problem a general assay for the turn-off reaction has now been developed. The adenylate cyclase is first activated by hormone and GTP and the introduction of GTP is then stopped either by addition of an excess of guanosine 5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) (GDP beta S) or by addition of a receptor blocking agent. The decay of adenylate cyclase activity brought on by these inhibitors is used to calculate the rate constant of the turn-off reaction. In turkey erythrocyte and rat parotid membranes the rate constant of the decay process as determined with GDP beta S is similar to that determined with the beta-adrenergic blocker propranolol. The rate constants (min-1 at 30 degrees C) for various adenylate cyclase preparations are 10 for turkey erythrocyte, 7.5 for rat parotid, and 6.2 for the rat liver enzyme. The finding of similar rate constants in the various preparations indicates that GTP hydrolysis at the regulatory site is a general mechanism for terminating the activation of adenylate cyclase."

At pH 7.7, the Km for carbamyl phosphate is 0.026 mM, and the Km for ornithine is 0.04 mM. The inhibition constants of a number of amino acids that act as competitive inhibitors of the enzyme are reported. The native enzyme of Mr = 112,000 is composed of three subunits of Mr = 39,600 +/- 1,000. Chemical evidence indicates that the subunits are identical in amino acid composition and amino acid sequence. The amino acid sequence of the NH2-terminal region of ornithine transcarbamylase is Ser-Gln-Val-Gln-Leu-Lys-Gly-Ser-Asp-Leu-Leu-Thr-Leu-Lys-Asn-(Phe)-X-Thr-X-Glu-Ile-Gln-Tyr-Met-."

https://openalex.org/W1496005353,"Solubilized proteins of the plasma membrane of bovine adrenal medulla were fractionated on the basis of their affinity for secretory vesicles. The isolation procedure included preparation of a highly purified fraction of plasma membranes, its solubilization in detergent, and application to a column prepared from glutaraldehyde-fixed chromaffin granules. Using this technique, one major polypeptide (80% of the material bound) was isolated. This protein has been shown to originate from the plasma membrane and has no affinity for fixed bovine adrenal medullary mitochondria or lysosomes. It is eluted most effectively by low pH (3.0) and can be rebound and re-eluted from fixed secretory granules. In sodium dodecyl sulfate and beta-mercaptoethanol it has an apparent molecular weight of 51,000. In addition, two minor components, comprising about 20% of the material bound were detected having apparent molecular weights in sodium dodecyl sulfate of 14,000 and 62,000. It is suggested that such a molecule could function as a plasma membrane-located receptor for chromaffin granules during the secretory process."
https://openalex.org/W1514427555,"The well separated transitions observed on heating synthetic core particles containing poly(dA-dT).poly(dA-dT) have allowed physicochemical studies to define the mechanism of the first, reversible transition. The shape of the particle, assessed by sedimentation velocity measurements, becomes extended at temperatures about 10 degrees C below the optical melting temperature; this change is unaffected by cross-linking the histones into a stable octamer. A portion of the DNA undergoes a transition to a structure more like that of protein-free poly(dA-dT).poly(dA-dT), as judged by circular dichroism measurements, also at temperatures below those necessary for optical melting. Digestion of 5'-32P-labeled particles with S1 nuclease at a temperature partly through the first optical transition demonstrates that the initial phase in melting core particles is separation of about 20 base pairs of DNA at each end of the particle segment from the histone core. Implications of this mechanism for transcription of histone-bound DNA segments in chromatin are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1501903408,"Abstract Membrane microenvironmental changes associated with thrombin-induced platelet activation were followed by fluorescence intensity and polarization studies of 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH)-labeled human platelets. The labeling of washed platelets with DPH did not alter platelet intactness and morphology. In response to thrombin, DPH-labeled platelets exhibited reduced serotonin release, yet aggregation was barely inhibited. Shape change induced by thrombin or ADP was indistinguishable in control and in DPH-labeled platelets. During platelet aggregation induced by thrombin, fluorescence intensity increased by about 14%, which may indicate a more hydrophobic exposure of the probe. However, no change in fluorescence was detected during platelet shape change, induced either by thrombin in presence of EDTA or by ADP. Thrombin-activated platelets exhibited an increase in values of fluorescence polarization (P) during the stages of shape change and secretion, which further increased during aggregation. A similar pattern of increase in P values characterized platelet shape changes, caused either by thrombin in the presence of EDTA or by ADP. Changes in individual platelets are discernible from the alterations of the aggregating cells. These results may indicate that platelet activation is accompanied by an increase in rigidity of the membrane lipids. Functionally, the elevated microviscosity may reflect a primary role of membrane lipids in modulating the process of platelet activation or secondary transitions in lipids due to membrane events mediated by proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1484569271,"Abstract The possible role of HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A) reductase (the rate-controlling enzyme of cholesterol biosynthesis) in regulating the rate of dolichyl phosphate biosynthesis in rat liver was investigated. Rats were either fasted 48 h or fed diets supplemented with the drug cholestyramine. The activity of HMG-CoA reductase was 5000-fold greater in liver from cholestyramine-fed rats as compared to fasted rats. The activity of dolichyl phosphate synthetase, the prenyl transferase responsible for the biosynthesis of dolichyl phosphate from farnesyl pyrophosphate and isopentenyl pyrophosphate, was similar in both nutritional conditions and was markedly less active than HMG-CoA reductase even in the fasted state. Acetate incorporation into cholesterol was 2200-fold greater in liver slices from cholestyramine-fed rats as compared to fasted rats. By contrast, acetate incorporation into dolichyl phosphate was only 6-fold higher. Further studies suggested that the levels of farnesyl pyrophosphate and isopentenyl pyrophosphate are several hundred-fold greater in liver from cholestyramine-treated rats. From these results, it is concluded that the rate of dolichyl phosphate biosynthesis in rat liver is not regulated by the activity of HMG-CoA reductase but is probably regulated at the level of dolichyl phosphate synthetase."

More than 99% of the naturally occurring polyadenosine diphosphoribose n greater than 4 was present in rat liver in covalent association with non-histone proteins. The chain length of the polymer varied between n = 4 and n = 34. Less than 1% of naturally occurring polyadenosine diphosphoribose n greater than 4 was almost evenly distributed between histone fractions f1, f2a, f2b, and f3. Adenosine diphosphoribose polymers of relatively long chain length were also detected in the histone fractions. The covalent association of polyadenosine diphosphoribose with non-histone proteins was demonstrated by affinity chromatography."

https://openalex.org/W1591119311,"Sea anemone contain a number of closely related peptide heart stimulants. In the present investigation, the conformation of anthropleurin A from Anthopleura xanthogrammica was investigated by laser Raman, circular dichroism, and fluorescence spectral methods and by the Chou-Fasman method using sequence data. The recent 13C NMR data of the peptide (Norton, R.S., and Norton, T.R. (1979) J. Biol. Chem., in press) provided useful information for the interpretation of the above-mentioned spectral data. The results from these spectral methods suggested that anthropleurin A and the related sea anemone peptides are roughly spherical in shape due to the presence of some beta-bends, possibly due to a beta-pleated sheet region and due to the 3 cystine residues in the peptide which exist in the gauche-gauche-gauche configuration. The sole tyrosine residue is exposed to the solvent, a finding which has now been confirmed by 13C NMR. The laser Raman and fluorescence spectral procedures showed that one or more of the tryptophan residues are buried. Interestingly, the reduction of the native protein with dithioerythritol did not change the spherical shape even in the presence of 5 M guanidine HCl and the carboxymethylcysteine derivative of the peptide was folded even in the presence of the denaturing agent, guanidine HCl."
https://openalex.org/W1489196150,"The incubation of prostaglandins (PG's) with liver microsomes from guinea pigs treated with inducers of monooxygenase (1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane (DDT), benzo[alpha]pyrene (benzpyrene), or a mixture of chlorinated biphenyls (Aroclor 1254)) exhibited marked elevation of 19-hydroxylation of PGE1, PGE2, PGA1, and PGA2 without affecting significantly 20-hydroxylation. However, with respect to effects on hydroxylation of a variety of xenobiotics, benzpyrene and Aroclor treatments differed markedly; whereas Aroclor treatment elevated the demethylation of ethylmorphine, benzphetamine, and p-chloro-N-methylaniline (PCMA), benzpyrene treatment had no effect on demethylation of ethylmorphine and only a marginal effect on that of PCMA. Both inducers elevated benzpyrene hydroxylation. By contrast, treatment with phenobarbital did not affect the hepatic microsomal PG's hydroxylation, although the hydroxylation of benzpyrene and the demethylation of ethylmorphine, benzphetamine, and PCMA were enhanced. Also, the hydroxylation of PG's by kidney cortex microsomes was not affected by either benzpyrene or Aroclor treatment. Inhibitors of monooxygenase were used to help delineate the type of monooxygenases induced. At low levels of alpha-naphthoflavone (ANF), benzpyrene hydroxylation in control- and Aroclor-treated guinea pigs was only little affected; by contrast, the same concentration of ANF markedly inhibited benzpyrene hydroxylation in benzpyrene-treated guinea pigs. On the other hand, metyrapone was most inhibitory in control guinea pigs. Support for the conclusion that benzpyrene induces in the guinea pig a hepatic monooxygenase with different characteristics than that found in control animals was provided by the observation that ANF (10 MICROM) inhibited PGE1 hydroxylation more pronouncedly in liver microsomes from benzpyrene-treated than from Aroclor-treated guinea pigs or controls. In addition, in benzpyrene and Aroclor-treated guinea pigs, ANF inhibited the (omega-1)-hydroxylation more pronouncedly than that of omega-hydroxylation. By contrast, metyrapone appeared to inhibit omega-hydroxylation more effectively than (omega-1)-hydroxylation. These results indicate that in the guinea pig, hydroxylation of PG's at the omega (20-) and omega-1 (19-) positions is catalyzed by different monooxygenases and that the inducers tested affect several hepatic monooxygenases with different specificities toward xenobiotics; however, with respect to PG's only the enzyme(s) involved in the 19-hydroxylation is affected."

https://openalex.org/W1492878067,"An enzyme, previously described as endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase L (Tarentino, A.L., and Maley, F. (1974) J. Biol. Chem. 249, 811-817) because of its apparent specificity for Man(GlcNAc)2Asn, has been purified to homogeneity. The enzyme has now been found to hydrolyze (GlcNAc)3 to (GlcNAc)2 plus GlcNAc, and (GlcNAc)4 to 2(GlcNAc)2, at twice the rate observed for Man(GlcNAc)2Asn. Removal of the asparagine from the latter compound reduces the rate of hydrolysis by about 30-fold. Reduction of (GlcNAc)3 to GlcNAc beta 1 leads to 4GlcNAc beta 1 leads to 4GlcNAc-ol eliminates this compound as a substrate for endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase L. However, the reduction of (GlcNAc)4 does not affect its rate of hydrolysis. Endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase L consists of a single polypeptide chain with a molecular weight of 49,500 +/- 400, which on isoelectric focusing separates into two closely migrating bands; a major with a pI of 4.25 and a minor one with a pI 4.20. Both bands possess similar enzyme activities and amino acid compositions, but differ slightly in their tryptic peptide maps."
https://openalex.org/W98721030,"Adenylate cyclase was solubilized from rat brain particulate fraction with the nonionic detergent, Nonidet P-40. Incubation of detergent-solubilized adenylate cyclase with liposomes prepared from egg yolk phosphatidylcholine results in virtually quantitative incorporation of the enzyme activity into phospholipid vesicles. Incorporation of adenylate cyclase into liposomes results in an approximately 10- to 20-fold purification relative to the solubilized preparation giving a final specific activity of about 50 nmol of cAMP min-1 mg-1. The detergent-solubilized adenylate cyclase migrates as a broad band between 14 and 33% sucrose on density gradient centrifugation, separated from the endogenous phospholipid. Following overnight incubation of the solubilized enzyme with exogenous phospholipid, all enzyme activity is found in a narrow band between 7 and 9% sucrose, co-migrating with the phospholipid. The adenylate cyclase could not be released from the liposomes by extraction with high ionic strength, low ionic strength-EDTA, or sonication. Treatment of liposomal adenylates cyclase with soluble proteases or immobilized trypsin destroys enzyme activity. Thus, it is likely that a functionally important part of the enzyme molecule is exposed on the outer surface of the liposome. Optimal conditions for the incorporation of adenylate cyclase into liposomes, and some effects of manipulating the phospholipid composition on enzyme activity are reported."

https://openalex.org/W1517773031,"Renal tubules from rabbit kidneys were isolated from thin shavings of the kidney surface. Basement membrane was then prepared following sonication of the isolated tubules. To insure preservation of the integrity of the basement membrane polypeptides, the protease inhibitors, diisopropyl fluorophosphate, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, N-ethylmaleimide, and epsilon-amino-caproic acid were used at all stages of the preparations. The optimal conditions of sonication and centrifugation were established and the chemical composition of basement membrane prepared under these conditions was examined in detail. Glycine, hydroxyproline, and hydroxylysine were found in concentrations of 206, 65, and 18 residues per thousand, respectively, in basement membrane from young kidneys. About 38% of the basement membrane was found to be soluble in sodium dodecyl sulfate upon incubation at 90 degrees C, and to possess relatively low amounts of the amino acids characteristic of collagen. Electrophoretic analysis of this fraction revealed that the major subunits ranged in approximate molecular weight from 18,500 to greater than 10(6). When analyzed with disulfide bonds reduced, a molecular weight range from 31,000 to 275,000 was observed for this fraction. The sodium dodecyl sulfate-insoluble fraction could be dissolved upon reduction and alkylation and its composition was enriched in the amino acids characteristic of collagen. Polypeptides from this fraction were analyzed by electrophoresis in agarose and in agarose-acrylamide gels. The approximate molecular weight of the smallest component was 164,000. Additional polypeptides were observed whose molecular weights occurred in multimers of this component, up to 1.1 x 10(6), possibly indicating covalent cross-linked multimers of a basic collagen-like polypeptide(s)."
https://openalex.org/W1538633401,"In vitro, the transport of [14C]riboflavin into and from the isolated choroid plexus, the anatomical locus of the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier, was studied. With concentrations of [14C]riboflavin of 0.7 microM (or greater) in the incubation medium, the choroid plexus accumulated [14C]riboflavin against a large concentration gradient by a process that did not depend on binding or intracellular metabolism of the [14C]riboflavin. The [14C]riboflavin accumulation process in isolated choroid plexus could be described by Michaelis-Menten transport kinetics (kt = 78 microM and Ymax = 1.65 mmol kg-1 (15 min)-1) and was inhibited by other flavins and probenecid but not by ribose, weak bases, or other B vitamins. The accumulation process was markedly depressed by iodoacetate and low temperatures. With a concentration of 0.08 microM [14C]riboflavin in the incubation medium, 28% of the [14C]riboflavin within the choroid plexus was converted to [14C]FAD or [14C]FMN intracellularly. Unlike the active transport of [14C]riboflavin into choroid plexus, accumulated [14C]riboflavin departed choroid plexus by a process independent of intracellular concentration or temperature. The efflux of [14C]riboflavin from choroid plexus could be described by first oder kinetics with a rate constant of -0.08 min-1."

https://openalex.org/W1519929840,"We have developed a system for the in vitro transcription of specific genes in rooster liver chromatin by endogenous RNA polymerase II that maintains the specificity of transcription in vivo. Radioactive transcripts synthesized in vitro were identified and quantitated by hybridization to a vast excess of cloned cDNA. The cDNA preparations employed corresponded to vitellogenin mRNA, the synthesis of which is responsive to estrogen stimulation in vivo, and chicken serum albumin mRNA, the synthesis of which is not significantly affected by estrogen stimulation in vivo. Comparing the pattern of transcription of the albumin and vitellogenin genes in chromatin from the liver of the normal rooster with the pattern in chromatin from the liver of the estrogen-stimulated rooster, we found that prior estrogen treatment of the rooster is attended by a slight decrease in the differential rate of transcription of the albumin gene and approximately a 10-fold increase in the differential rate of transcription of the vitellogenin gene. Because this pattern of transcription reflects the estrogen-induced changes in transcription observed in vivo, chromatin preparations from the livers of normal and estrogen-stimulated roosters can be used to investigate regulation of specific gene transcription at the molecular level in vitro."

https://openalex.org/W1603427111,"The kinetic properties of partially purified rat liver selenium-glutathione peroxidase were studied under various conditions. Steady state kinetic measurements show sigmoidal saturation curves, parabolic double reciprocal plots, and Hill coefficients greater than unity. Although these kinetic results appear to show cooperative interactions between subunits, they more reflect the presence of several oxidation-reduction forms of the catalytic site. A substrate-induced transition between enzyme forms was evidence by the occurrence of a lag in the attainment of the final steady state velocity under certain preincubation conditions. This hysteretic behavior was evident only when the enzyme was incubated in the absence of reduced glutathione, the donor substrate. Thus, reduced glutathione induces the transition to the fully active form of the enzyme, a slow process requiring about 0.5 min after addition of glutathione, depending on conditions. The length, tau, of the lag period is dependent on the concentrations of enzyme and glutathione, but to a first approximation, this lag period is independent of the concentration of the hydroperoxide acceptor substrate. The lag period is also relatively independent of the nature of the hydroperoxide species. A model for the transition process that is compatible with these observations and with the possible oxidation-reduction properties of the selenium moiety of the enzyme is suggested."
