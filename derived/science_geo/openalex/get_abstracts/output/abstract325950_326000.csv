https://openalex.org/W2055325400,"Molecular dynamics simulations and atomic force microscopy are used to investigate the atomistic mechanisms of adhesion, contact formation, nanoindentation, separation, and fracture that occur when a nickel tip interacts with a gold surface. The theoretically predicted and experimentally measured hysteresis in the force versus tip-to-sample distance relationship, found upon approach and subsequent separation of the tip from the sample, is related to inelastic deformation of the sample surface characterized by adhesion of gold atoms to the nickel tip and formation of a connective neck of atoms. At small tipsample distances, mechanical instability causes the tip and surface to jump-to-contact, which in turn leads to adhesion-induced wetting of the nickel tip by gold atoms. Subsequent indentation of the substrate results in the onset of plastic deformation of the gold surface. The atomic-scale mechanisms underlying the formation and elongation of a connective neck, which forms upon separation, consist of structural transformations involving elastic and yielding stages."
https://openalex.org/W2122043751,"Pigeon pea was shown to be more efficient at utilizing iron-bound phosphorus (Fe-P) than several other crop species. This ability is attributed to root exudates, in particular piscidic acid and its p-O-methyl derivative, which release phosphorus from Fe-P by chelating Fe(3+). Pigeon pea is normally intercropped with cereals under low-input conditions in the Indian subcontinent. Although pigeon pea can utilize the relatively insoluble Fe-P, intercropped cereals must rely on the more soluble calcium-bound phosphorus. This finding suggests that cultivation of pigeon pea increases total phosphorus availability in cropping systems with low available phosphorus."
https://openalex.org/W2086998126,"Analyses of particle size distributions indicate that clay minerals and other diagenetic and metamorphic minerals commonly undergo recrystallization by Ostwald ripening. The shapes of their particle size distributions can yield the rate law for this process. One consequence of Ostwald ripening is that a record of the recrystallization process is preserved in the various particle sizes. Therefore, one can determine the detailed geologic history of clays and other recrystallized minerals by separating, from a single sample, the various particle sizes for independent chemical, structural, and isotopic analyses."
https://openalex.org/W1968814930,"Crystals of MgSiO(3) perovskite synthesized at high pressures and temperatures have orthorhombic symmetry under ambient conditions. Examination by transmission electron microscopy shows that the microstructure of crystals synthesized at 26 gigapascals and 1600 degrees C is dominated by a large number of twin domains that are related by reflection operations with respect to {112} and {110} planes. These twins may be associated with the transformations of MgSiO(3) perovskite from the cubic to tetragonal and tetragonal to orthorhombic phases, respectively, upon decreasing pressure and temperature. These observations suggest that under the experimental synthesis conditions, and perhaps in the earth's lower mantle, the stable phase of MgSiO(3) might have the cubic perovskite structure."
https://openalex.org/W2088527771,"The term ""underclass"" has been widely used by journalists and by some social scientists but, until recently, has not been clearly defined or quantified. Most of the recent quantitatively oriented literature on the topic has used a definition that emphasizes either the persistence ofpoverty or the number ofpeople living in neighborhoods where the incidence ofpoverty or dysfunctional behavior is high. Conclusions about the size and growth of the underclass are sensitive to the definition chosen, but most available evidence suggests that it is small but growing."
https://openalex.org/W2073590480,"Projections are analyzed for the future supply and demand of scientists and engineers. The demographics of the college-age population combined with estimates of the percentage of students who will pursue careers in science and engineering indicate significant shortfalls between supply and demand for the next several decades at both the baccalaureate and Ph.D. levels. If these projections are realized, the shortage of technical personnel will have a major impact on economic growth, international competitiveness, and national security. Various strategies for recruiting and retaining students in science and engineering are considered."
https://openalex.org/W2079203380,"Measurements of the melting temperature of lead, carried out to pressures of 1 megabar (1011 pascal) and temperatures near 4000 kelvin by means of a laser-heated diamond cell, are in excellent agreement with the results of previous shock-wave experiments. The data are analyzed by means of first principles quantum mechanical calculations, and the agreement documents the reliability of current experimental and theoretical techniques for studies of melting at ultrahigh pressures. These studies have potentially wide-ranging applications, from planetary science to condensed matter physics."

https://openalex.org/W2022768358,"Shell-encrusting species of the coral Aulopora and the bryozoan Leioclema changed ecological pgilds and escaped limits imposed by substrate size through mutstic intergrowth during the Early Devonian. Where colonies of these species intergew, they produced upright, arborescent masses consisting of sparsely branched uniserial Aulopora sp. entirely covered, except for calyx openings, by a thin encrustation of Leioclema sp. These interrowts appear to constitute a mutualistic association with benefits induding escape from limited space on the substratum into a higher tier of suspension feeders, as well as more modules per colony. Such mutualism between benthic modular competitors may have developed more readily than assocations between solitary competitors."

The Europeans were interested in actions to stabilize or curb emissions of greenhouse gases while the US position stressed the need for more research. At the end of the second day some reconciliation was achieved between these views with a future session planned, possibly later this year, to negotiate a climate convention."
