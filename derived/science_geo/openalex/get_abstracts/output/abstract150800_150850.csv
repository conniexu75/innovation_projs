https://openalex.org/W1521510688,"Hydrogen could be the ultimate clean fuel of the future, but it is expensive and difficult to handle. Fuel cells that can directly oxidize the hydrogen found in regular fuels (principally hydrocarbons) offer a real alternative to the dirty and wasteful combustion processes by which most hydrocarbons are oxidized today."
https://openalex.org/W2058057521,"Over the past century the power of artificial light sources has increased exponentially from a kilowatt to a petawatt (1015watts). As a result the world's most powerful lasers can now accelerate electrons to relativistic speeds, making laser-induced nuclear fission a reality."
https://openalex.org/W2770967773,"Quantum mechanics allows matter to be prepared in a strangely correlated way called entanglement. In future, large numbers of entangled particles may be put to work in quantum computers and precise quantum measurements."
