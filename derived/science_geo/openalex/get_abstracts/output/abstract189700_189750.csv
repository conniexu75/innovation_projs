Here, we examined the hypothesis that OS and LS differentially regulate production of O2- from the endothelial NAD(P)H oxidase, which, in turn, is responsible for their opposite effects on a critical atherogenic event, monocyte adhesion. We used aortic endothelial cells obtained from C57BL/6 (MAE-C57) and p47phox-/- (MAE-p47-/-) mice, which lack a component of NAD(P)H oxidase. O2- production was determined by dihydroethidium staining and an electron spin resonance using an electron spin trap methoxycarbonyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-pyrrolidine. Chronic exposure (18 h) to an arterial level of OS (± 5 dynes/cm2) increased O2- (2-fold) and monocyte adhesion (3-fold) in MAE-C57 cells, whereas chronic LS (15 dynes/cm2, 18 h) significantly decreased both monocyte adhesion and O2- compared with static conditions. In contrast, neither LS nor OS were able to induce O2- production and monocyte adhesion to MAE-p47-/-. Treating MAE-C57 with a cell-permeable superoxide dismutase compound, polyethylene glycol-superoxide dismutase, also inhibited OS-induced monocyte adhesion. In addition, over-expressing p47phox in MAE-p47-/- restored OS-induced O2- production and monocyte adhesion. These results suggest that chronic exposure of endothelial cells to OS stimulates O2- and/or its derivatives produced from p47phox-dependent NAD(P)H oxidase, which, in turn, leads to monocyte adhesion, an early and critical atherogenic event.

Fluid shear stress, the frictional force generated by blood flow over the vascular endothelium, is a major factor in atherogenesis. The importance of shear stress in vascular biology and pathophysiology has been highlighted by the focal development patterns of atherosclerosis in hemodynamically defined regions. For example, regions of branched and curved arteries experience disturbed blood flow patterns, including oscillatory shear stress (OS), 1The abbreviations used are: OSoscillatory shearLSlaminal shearNOnitric oxideROSreactive oxygen speciesDiI-Ac-LDL1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3,3′-tetramethyl-indocarbocyanine perchlorate-labeled acetylated low density lipoproteinDHEdihydroethidiumCMHmethoxycarbonyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-pyrrolidinePEGpolyethylene glycolSODsuperoxide dismutaseTBAPtetrakis-(4-benzoic acid) porphyrin. typically ranging ± 5 dynes/cm2 (± indicates changes in flow directions) (1Zarins C.K.

Arteriosclerosis. 1985; 5: 293-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These disturbed shear regions correspond to “lesion-prone” areas that develop early forms of atherosclerotic lesions (1Zarins C.K.

In contrast, relatively straight arteries, which are exposed to steady uni-directional laminar shear stress (typically ranging from 5–25 dynes/cm2), are usually protected from early atherosclerotic plaque development (1Zarins C.K.

The mechanisms by which laminar shear (LS) acts as atheroprotective force whereas OS initiates or contributes to atherogenesis have been the subject of intense investigation by many researchers. oscillatory shear laminal shear nitric oxide reactive oxygen species 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3,3′-tetramethyl-indocarbocyanine perchlorate-labeled acetylated low density lipoprotein dihydroethidium methoxycarbonyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-pyrrolidine polyethylene glycol superoxide dismutase tetrakis-(4-benzoic acid) porphyrin. The vascular endothelium is in direct contact with blood flow and acts as a mechanotransducer by sensing and transducing the changes in local mechanical forces into cellular signals. Endothelial function, shape, physiology, and pathophysiology are greatly regulated by the types (uni-directional laminar or disturbed flow conditions) and magnitudes (high or low) of the shear stress imparted upon them (4Berk B.C. Abe J.I. Min W. Surapisitchat J. Yan C. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2001; 947: 93-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 5Davies P.F. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 519-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (2356) Google Scholar). LS exerts atheroprotective effects, including regulation of vascular tone, diameter and vessel wall remodeling, prevention of apoptosis, and monocyte adhesion (4Berk B.C. Abe J.I. Min W. Surapisitchat J. Yan C. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2001; 947: 93-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 5Davies P.F. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 519-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (2356) Google Scholar). These functions are mediated by regulating the production of several vasoactive factors, including NO, and by the expression of mechanosensitive and atheroprotective genes in endothelial cells (4Berk B.C. Abe J.I. Min W. Surapisitchat J. Yan C. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2001; 947: 93-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 5Davies P.F. Physiol.

In contrast, the exposure of endothelial cells to disturbed flow conditions such as OS has been shown to induce several inflammatory and pro-atherogenic responses, including monocyte adhesion as observed in human arteries, animal models, and cultured endothelial cells (4Berk B.C.

The induction of inflammatory adhesion molecules, including E-selectin, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and the consequent monocyte adhesion to the lesion-prone areas seem to be the earliest visible markers leading to atherosclerotic plaque development (3Ross R.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS), including superoxide (O2-), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and peroxynitrite (ONOO-), have been implicated in atherogenesis (9Griendling K.K. Sorescu D. Ushio-Fukai M. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 494-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2625) Google Scholar, 10Patel R.P. Moellering D. Murphy-Ullrich J. Jo H. Beckman J.S. Darley-Usmar V.M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1780-1794Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Although the phagocytic NAD(P)H oxidase is the major source of O2- in the circulatory system, vascular endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and fibroblasts also express functional leukocyte-type NAD(P)H oxidases (9Griendling K.K. Sorescu D. Ushio-Fukai M. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 494-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2625) Google Scholar). The endothelial NAD(P)H oxidase is comprised of five major components, namely gp91phox (and/or its homologues) and p22phox in the membrane and p47phox, p67phox, and Rac in the cytosol, and it has been suggested to be the major source of O2- in these cells (9Griendling K.K. Sorescu D. Ushio-Fukai M. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 494-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2625) Google Scholar). p47phox in endothelial cells has been shown to play an essential role in activation of NAD(P)H oxidase and the production of O2- (11Babior B.M. Isr. Med. Assoc. J. 2002; 4: 1023-1024PubMed Google Scholar, 12Landmesser U. Cai H. Dikalov S. McCann L. Hwang J. Jo H. Holland S.M. Harrison D.G. Hypertension. 2002; 40: 511-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Recent results have shown that both LS and OS can induce ROS production from endothelial cells (13Go Y.M. Patel R.P. Maland M.C. Park H. Beckman J.S. Darley-Usmar V.M. Jo H. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: H1647-H1653PubMed Google Scholar, 14De Keulenaer G.W. Chappell D.C. Ishizaka N. Nerem R.M. Alexander R.W. Griendling K.K. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 1094-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). De Keulenaer et al. suggested that an NAD(P)H-dependent oxidase was activated by LS and OS (14De Keulenaer G.W. Chappell D.C. Ishizaka N. Nerem R.M. Alexander R.W. Griendling K.K. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 1094-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar); however, the molecular identity of this oxidase remains to be determined. Moreover, the identity of its source as well as its pathophysiological roles in cells remain unclear due, in large part, to the lack of specific molecular approaches, thus relying heavily on the use of inhibitors/scavengers of ROS. For example, chronic exposure to OS has been shown to activate endothelial cells to stimulate monocyte adhesion, which can be blocked by treating with a nonspecific antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine, during shear (8Chappell D.C. Varner S.E. Nerem R.M. Medford R.M. Alexander R.W. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 532-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). This result suggests a role for ROS in this inflammatory response. Here, we hypothesized that the ROS produced by shear stress is O2- derived from NAD(P)H oxidase. We further hypothesized that LS and OS differentially regulate production of O2-, which, in turn, is responsible for regulating monocyte adhesion. To examine these hypotheses, we used aortic endothelial cells (MAE cells) obtained from either normal (C57BL/6) or knockout mice (p47phox-/-) that lack a key component of NAD(P)H oxidases, the p47phox gene (15Jackson S.H. Gallin J.I. Holland S.M. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 751-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that the chronic exposure of endothelial cells to OS stimulates monocyte adhesion by a mechanism dependent on O2- derived from NAD(P)H oxidase, whereas LS induces transient O2- production followed by a substantial inhibition in both O2- production and monocyte adhesion. Genotyping of p47phox DNA—Genotyping of mice was performed with the p47phox-specific primers 5′-ACATCACAGGCCCCATCATCCTCC-3′ and 5′-GGAGAGCCCCCTTTCTCTCCCTCA-3′ and the neomycin-resistant primer 5′-CAACGTCGAGCACAGCTGCGCAAG-3′ (15Jackson S.H. Gallin J.I. Holland S.M. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 751-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). PCR was performed in a 50-μl reaction containing 200 μm dNTP, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 2 units of Taq polymerase (Invitrogen), and 0.5 μm each primer. The denaturing temperature was 95 °C for 3 min, and the cycling parameters were 95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min for 30 cycles. PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel (2%) electrophoresis. Isolation and Culture of Mouse Thoracic Aorta Endothelial Cells— Pathogen-free male C57BL/6 mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratories, and p47phox-/- mice were described previously (15Jackson S.H. Gallin J.I. Holland S.M. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 751-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). MAE cells were isolated by modifying a previously described method (16Suh S.H. Vennekens R. Manolopoulos V.G. Freichel M. Schweig U. Prenen J. Flockerzi V. Droogmans G. Nilius B. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1999; 438: 612-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Briefly, the thoracic aorta was dissected free of adventitia and cut into small pieces (∼2 × 2 mm). The explants were cultured intimal side down on Matrigel (BD Biosciences)-coated 6-well plates in an initial growth medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml endothelial cell growth supplement (Sigma), 10 units/ml heparin, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin). Initially, a very small volume of medium was added onto the outside of the piece of aorta, which was just enough to keep the Matrigel wet but not enough to cover the outer side of the aorta; this inhibited fibroblast growth. One drop of medium was added each day. Two to three days post-isolation, endothelial cells began to grow out of the aortic intima. Aortic pieces were removed from the wells showing capillary-like tubes within 4–5 days, a characteristic of endothelial cells on Matrigel matrix. Adherent cells were allowed to grow in 2 ml of medium. After ∼10 days of culture, cells grown out of the explants were trypsinized and seeded on collagen-coated 6-well tissue culture plates. Cell Sorting and Characterization—To isolate pure MAE cells, wells containing cells reaching confluence with apparent cobblestone shapes were loaded with acetylated low density lipoprotein conjugated to 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3,3′-tetramethyl-indocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI-Ac-LDL) and sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Briefly, cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml DiI-Ac-LDL (Biomedical Technologies) in the initial growth medium for 4 h at 37 °C. The cells were rinsed with the initial growth media, trypsinized, and centrifuged for 5 min at 1,000 rpm. Cell pellets were resuspended into a single cell suspension in fresh medium and sorted by florescence-activated cell sorting (488-nm excitation and 525-nm emission wavelength). Rat vascular smooth muscle cells and bovine and mouse aortic endothelial cells were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. The sorted cells were grown on collagen-coated tissue culture plates and observed by fluorescent microscopy. Only when all of the observed cells were labeled with DiI-Ac-LDL were the cells used for further study. To further ascertain the purity of endothelial cells, passaged endothelial cells were stained with a polyclonal von Willebrand factor antibody (Dako, 1:100 dilution) for 30 min, followed by rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Molecular Probes, 1:1000 dilution) for 30 min. Subsequently, cells were mounted with an anti-fade (Molecular Probes) and photographed with a Zeiss fluorescent microscope. Cell Culture and Shear Exposure—MAE cells obtained from C57 (MAE-C57) and p47phox-/- (MAE-p47-/-) mouse aortas were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a growth medium (the same as the initial growth medium except for the heparin concentration, 2.5 units/ml). Cells used in this study were between passages 4 and 10. For shear experiments, cells were plated on 0.5% gelatin-coated 100-mm plates (Falcon). One day prior to shear experiments, the media were changed to endothelial cell growth supplement-free growth media. Monocytes from a human monocytic leukemia cell line, THP-1, were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a growth medium (RPMI 1640; Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 50 units/ml penicillin. Monocytes were maintained at a density of 5 × 105 cells/ml. Confluent MAE monolayers grown in 100-mm tissue culture dishes were exposed to an arterial level of uni-directional laminar shear stress (15 dynes/cm2) in the growth medium by rotating a Teflon cone (0.5° cone angle) as we have described previously (17Go Y.M. Park H. Maland M.C. Darley-Usmar V.M. Stoyanov B. Wetzker R. Jo H. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: H1898-H1904PubMed Google Scholar). To mimic unstable shear conditions in vivo, cells were exposed to oscillatory shear stress with directional changes of flow at 1 Hz cycle (± 5 dynes/cm2) by rotating the cone back-and-forth using a stepping motor (Servo Motor) controlled by a computer program (DC Motor Company) (7Sorescu G.P. Sykes M. Weiss D. Platt M.O. Saha A. Hwang J. Boyd N. Boo Y.C. Vega J.D. Taylor W.R. Jo H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31128-31135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Determination of Protein Expression by Western Blot Analysis—Cell lysates (20 μg protein each) were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore), and probed with a primary antibody specific to p47phox (BD Transduction Laboratories). IgG conjugated with alkaline phosphatases (Bio-Rad) were used as secondary antibodies, and the membrane was developed using chemiluminescence detection (18Jo H. Sipos K. Go Y.M. Law R. Rong J. McDonald J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1395-1401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The intensities of the immunoreactive bands in the Western blots were quantified using the NIH IMAGE program. Superoxide Measurement by Dihydroethidium—Intracellular O2- production was measured using the cell-permeable dye dihydroethidium (DHE; Molecular Probes), which binds to nuclear DNA when oxidized by O2- and emits red fluorescence (19Szocs K. Lassegue B. Sorescu D. Hilenski L.L. Valppu L. Couse T.L. Wilcox J.N. Quinn M.T. Lambeth J.D. Griendling K.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

Med. 2003; 34: 1359-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). Briefly, following shear exposure in the presence or absence of antioxidants, cells were immediately incubated with 10 μm DHE for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were then washed in ice-cold fresh DHE-free medium, and the fluorescence intensity was semi-quantified by Bio-Rad laser scanning fluorescence microscopy (514-nm excitation line and 580 ± 30 nm band pass filter) (19Szocs K. Lassegue B. Sorescu D. Hilenski L.L. Valppu L. Couse T.L. Wilcox J.N. Quinn M.T. Lambeth J.D. Griendling K.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). O2- production was estimated by determining the intensity of the fluorescence images taken randomly at a minimum of five different locations of each dish using the NIH IMAGE program (Scion Image Beta 4.02). Superoxide Measurement by ESR—As a second approach, O2- was measured by ESR spectroscopy using the spin probe, methoxycarbonyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-pyrrolidine (CMH), as described previously (21Kuzkaya N. Weissmann N. Harrison D.G. Dikalov S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22546-22554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Each ESR assay was carried out using cells treated with or without polyethylene glycol-superoxide dismutase (PEG-SOD; 50 units/ml) to quantify the SOD-inhibitable formation of CM·. Following experimental treatments (shear or static), MAE cells were rinsed with ice-cold Krebs-Hepes buffer (5.6 mm d-glucose, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 99 mm NaCl, 4.69 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 25 mm NaHCO3, 1 mm KH2PO4, and 20 mm sodium-HEPES; pH 7.4) and scraped from the tissue culture dishes. To inhibit iron-catalyzed reactions, 25 μm desferrioxamine and 5 μm diethylenetriamine-pentaacetic acid were added to all samples. After centrifugation at 2,000 rpm for 1 min, the cells were resuspended in 200 μl of Krebs-Hepes buffer and stored on ice. Cells were counted, and an equal number of cells containing 1 mm CMH was transferred to a 50-μl capillary tube to scan in a super high Q microwave cavity of an EMX ESR spectrometer (Bruker BioSpin). The ESR settings were as follows: field sweep, 50 G; microwave frequency, 9.78 GHz; microwave power, 20 milliwatts; modulation amplitude, 2 G; conversion time, 656 ms; time constant, 656 ms; resolution, 512 points; and receiver gain, 1 × 105. The kinetics were recorded by using a 1312-ms conversion time and 5248-ms time constant and monitoring the ESR amplitude of the low field component of the ESR spectrum of 3-methoxycarbonyl-proxyl. Monocyte Adhesion Assay—The monocyte binding to endothelial cells was determined using a modified method of Tsao et al. (22Tsao P.S. Buitrago R. Chan J.R. Cooke J.P. Circulation. 1996; 94: 1682-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Briefly, THP-1 cells (5 × 105 cells/ml) were labeled with the fluorescent dye 2′,7′-bis(carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein acetoxymethyl ester (BCECF-AM; Molecular Probes) (1 μg/μl) in serum-free RPMI medium for 45 min at 37 °C (8Chappell D.C. Varner S.E. Nerem R.M. Medford R.M. Alexander R.W. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 532-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Following exposure to shear stress or other treatments, the endothelial cells were washed in RPMI medium before adding 2′,7′-bis(carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein-loaded THP-1 cells (1:1 ratio). After a 30-min incubation at 37 °C under no-flow conditions, unbound monocytes were removed by washing the endothelial dishes five times with Hank's phosphate-buffered solution. Bound monocytes were quantified by either counting the cells under a fluorescent microscope or by measuring the fluorescent intensity of cell lysates by fluorescence spectrophotometry (8Chappell D.C. Varner S.E. Nerem R.M. Medford R.M. Alexander R.W. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 532-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 22Tsao P.S. Buitrago R. Chan J.R. Cooke J.P. Circulation. 1996; 94: 1682-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Both methods yielded similar results. p47phox Transfection into MAE-p47-/-—MAE-p47-/- cells were grown to 90% confluency and transfected with the full-length p47phox cDNA inserted in EbopLPP vector (kindly provided by Dr. B M. Babior) or the empty vector alone using LipofectAMINE as we have described previously (7Sorescu G.P. Sykes M. Weiss D. Platt M.O. Saha A. Hwang J. Boyd N. Boo Y.C. Vega J.D. Taylor W.R. Jo H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31128-31135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Following 36 h of incubation, the medium was changed to a fresh growth medium. Transfection efficiency (30–40%) was estimated by determining green fluorescent protein expression (pEGFP vector, Clontech) by fluorescent microscopy. Statistical Analysis—For all the experiments, statistical analysis was performed by using the Student's t test. A significance of p < 0.05 from three or more independent experiments was considered statistically significant. Characterization of MAE-C57 and MAE-p47-/-Cells—Genotypes of C57BL/6 and p47phox-/- mice were confirmed by PCR with genomic DNA obtained from tail tissues using two p47phox-specific primers and neomycin-resistant primers as described (15Jackson S.H. Gallin J.I. Holland S.M. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 751-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). As expected, the wild type mice showed a 650-bp band (Fig. 1A, lane 1), whereas p47phox knockout mice showed a 900-bp band because it contains the neomycin cassette inserted to generate the knockout (Fig. 1A, lane 2). Fig. 1A, lane 3 was a negative control for PCR containing no DNA. To assess the purity of wild type MAE and MAE-p47-/- cells isolated from the thoracic aortas of C57BL/6 and p47phox-/- mice, cells were labeled with the endothelial marker DiI-Ac-LDL (Fig 1, B and C). The identity and purity of MAE cells were further confirmed by the positive staining of all sorted cells using an additional endothelial cell marker, the von Willebrand factor (Fig. 1C). Immunostaining with antibodies specific to the platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM-1) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) further confirmed endothelial cell purity (data not shown). To ensure that the p47phox gene product was indeed absent in MAE-p47-/- cells, cell lysates were analyzed by Western blot using an antibody specific for p47phox. As expected, MAE-p47-/- cells did not express p47phox protein in more than four independent preparations from four different mouse thoracic aortas, whereas its expression was clearly identified in more than four independent MAE-C57 cell preparations (Fig. 1E; see also Fig. 9C). Alignment of MAE Cells by Shear Stress—MAE-C57 and MAE-p47-/- cells grown under static (no flow) culture conditions were not distinguishable from each other and showed typical cobblestone shapes (Fig. 2). Although we do not use cells beyond 10 passages for any of our studies, both cell types could be cultured for at least 10 passages without showing any detectable phenotypic changes. To examine whether these cells respond to shear stress in an expected manner, confluent MAE-C57 and MAE-p47-/- monolayers were exposed to arterial levels of LS or OS by using a cone-and-plate device for 18 h. Both MAE-C57 and MAE-p47-/- cells aligned to the direction of imposed laminar shear (Fig. 2). Additional comparisons between the two MAE cell types showed that their exposure to LS stimulated phosphorylation of p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinases (extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2) and Akt (two well known shear-dependent signaling proteins) in a similar time course pattern with similar fold stimulations (data not shown). Moreover, as expected, neither MAE cell type displayed any signs of alignment when exposed to oscillatory shear (Fig. 2). These results suggest that both MAE cells respond in an expected manner to align to the imposed shear conditions and that the p47phox gene product does not alter this morphological response. Differential Effects of LS and OS onO2-Production from NAD(P)H Oxidase—Here, we examined whether relatively short (1–2 h) or long-term (18–24 h) exposure of endothelial cells to LS or OS regulates O2- production from NAD(P)H oxidases. We initially used an immunocytochemical method using DHE as an indicator of intracellular O2- production. Acute exposure of MAE-C57 cells to either LS or OS for a short period (1 h) significantly increased O2- production by 2.5-fold above static controls (Fig. 3). This result is consistent with previous findings (14De Keulenaer G.W. Chappell D.C. Ishizaka N. Nerem R.M. Alexander R.W. Griendling K.K. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 1094-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). To ascertain the specificity of O2- production, MAE-C57 cells were treated with a cell-permeable SOD (PEG-SOD) or a SOD mimetic (manganese-TBAP). Both reagents substantially prevented O2- production in response to shear (Fig. 3). These results suggest that acute exposure of MAE-C57 cells to either LS or OS stimulated O2- production to a similar degree. We next examined whether this ROS was produced from NAD(P)H oxidases. To this end, we exposed MAE-p47-/- cells to LS or OS for 1 h and determined O2- production by DHE staining. In static conditions, MAE-p47-/- cells produced approximately half the amount of O2- compared with that of MAE-C57 cells (Fig. 3). More importantly, neither LS nor OS exposure was able to stimulate O2- production in MAE-p47-/- (Fig. 3). These results clearly suggest that shortterm exposure of MAE-C57 cells to LS or OS stimulate ROS production, most likely O2-, from p47phox-dependent NAD(P)H oxidases. To assess shear stress-stimulated production of O2- in a more specific and quantitative manner, we used ESR. CMH was used as an O2--specific spin trap, and PEG-SOD-inhibitable formation of CM· was"

Despite similar total plasma cholesterol levels in response to hypercholesterolemia, HO-1-/-apoE-/- mice, in comparison with HO-1+/+apoE-/- mice, had an accelerated and more advanced atherosclerotic lesion formation. In addition to greater lipid accumulation, these advanced lesions from HO-1-/-apoE-/- mice contained macrophages and smooth muscle alpha-actin-positive cells. We further tested the role of HO-1 on neointimal formation in a mouse model of vein graft stenosis. Autologous vein grafts in HO-1-/- mice showed robust neointima consisting of alpha-actin-positive vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) 10 days after surgery in comparison to the smaller neointima formed in autologous vein grafts in HO-1+/+ mice. However, at 14 days after surgery, the neointima from composite vessels of HO-1-/- mice was composed mainly of acellular material, indicative of substantial VSMC death. VSMC isolated from HO-1-/- mice were susceptible to oxidant stress, leading to cell death. Our data demonstrate that HO-1 plays an essential protective role in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis and vein graft stenosis."

Cleavage of pre-formed AGEs within the kidney by a cross-link breaker, such as ALT-711, may confer renoprotection in diabetes. STZ diabetic rats were randomized into a) no treatment (D); b) treatment with the AGE cross-link breaker, ALT-711, weeks 16-32 (DALT early); and c) ALT-711, weeks 24-32 (DALT late). Treatment with ALT-711 resulted in a significant reduction in diabetes-induced serum and renal AGE peptide fluorescence, associated with decreases in renal carboxymethyllysine and RAGE immunostaining. Cross-linking of tail tendon collagen seen in diabetic groups was attenuated only by 16 weeks of ALT-711 treatment. ALT-711, independent of treatment duration, retarded albumin excretion rate (AER), reduced blood pressure, and renal hypertrophy. It also reduced diabetes-induced increases in gene expression of transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), and collagen IV. However, glomerulosclerotic index, tubulointerstitial area, total renal collagen, nitrotyrosine, protein expression of collagen IV, and TGF-beta1 only showed improvement with early ALT treatment alone. This study demonstrates the utility of a cross-link breaker as a treatment for diabetic nephropathy and describes effects not only on renal AGEs but on putative mediators of renal injury, such as prosclerotic cytokines and oxidative stress."

This is assumed to result in electrophoretic extrusion of such anions from the inner to the outer leaflet of the inner mitochondrial membrane, being driven by membrane potential (mitochondrial interior negative). In this way, the inner leaflet is ridded of fatty acid peroxides that otherwise can form very aggressive oxidants damaging mitochondrial DNA, aconitase, and other mitochondrial matrix-localized components of vital importance. The steady-state concentration the fatty acid peroxides is known to be low. This explains why UCP2, 3, 4, and 5 are present in small amounts usually insufficient to make a large contribution to the H+ conductance of the mitochondrial membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2170023789,"Improving the ability of the kidney to tolerate ischemic injury has important implications. We investigated the effect of recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) treatment on subsequent ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury and evaluated the role of heat shock protein (HSP) 70 in rHuEPO-induced renal protection. rHuEPO (3000 U/kg) was administered 24 h before I/R injury, and rats were killed at 24, 48, and 72 h after I/R injury. Pretreatment of rHuEPO resulted in the following: i) decreased serum creatinine level; ii) decreased tubular cell apoptosis and necrosis, measured by DNA fragmentation analysis and TUNEL staining and histomorphological criteria; iii) decreased tubular cell proliferation as determined by proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression; iv) increased bcl-2 protein and decreased caspase 3 activity; and v) decreased JNK expression. rHuEPO treatment increased HSP70 expression in a dose-dependent manner in normal rat kidneys, and inhibition of HSP70 expression by quercetin eliminated the renoprotective effect of rHuEPO in ischemic kidneys. Our study demonstrates that rHuEPO has a protective effect on subsequent I/R injury and that this effect is associated with induction of HSP70. Our study provides a new avenue for therapy to prevent renal damage after I/R injury."
https://openalex.org/W2164631866,"Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is induced under a variety of pro-oxidant conditions such as those associated with ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) of transplanted organs. HO-1 cleaves the heme porphyrin ring releasing Fe2+, which induces the expression of the Fe2+ sequestering protein ferritin. By limiting the ability of Fe2+ to participate in the generation of free radicals through the Fenton reaction, ferritin acts as an anti-oxidant. We have previously shown that HO-1 protects transplanted organs from IRI. We have linked this protective effect with the anti-apoptotic action of HO-1. Whether the iron-binding properties of ferritin contributed to the protective effect of HO-1 was not clear. We now report that recombinant adenovirus mediated overexpression of the ferritin heavy chain (H-ferritin) gene protects rat livers from IRI and prevents hepatocellular damage upon transplantation into syngeneic recipients. The protective effect of H-ferritin is associated with the inhibition of endothelial cell and hepatocyte apoptosis in vivo. H-ferritin protects cultured endothelial cells from apoptosis induced by a variety of stimuli. These findings unveil the anti-apoptotic function of H-ferritin and suggest that H-ferritin can be used in a therapeutic manner to prevent liver IRI and thus maximize the organ donor pool used for transplantation."

Here we report that Met-F-AEA also blocks the growth of tumors previously induced in nude mice by the s.c. injection of the same rat thyroid carcinoma cells. Met-F-AEA significantly inhibited, in tumors as well as transformed cells, the expression of the vascular endothelial growth factor, an angiogenetic factor known to be up-regulated by p21ras, as well as of one of its receptors, flt-1/VEGFR-1. The levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27(kip1), which is down-regulated by p21ras, were instead increased by Met-F-AEA. All these effects were antagonized by the selective CB1 receptor antagonist SR141716A. Met-F-AEA inhibited in vitro the growth of a metastasis-derived thyroid cancer cell line more potently than a primary cancer cell line. Therefore, the hypothesis that CB1 receptor stimulation interferes not only with angiogenesis but also with metastatic processes was tested in a widely used model of metastatic infiltration in vivo, the Lewis lung carcinoma (3LL) in C57Bl/6 mice. Three weeks from the paw injection of 3LL cells, Met-F-AEA reduced significantly the number of metastatic nodes, in a way antagonized by SR141716A. Our findings indicate that CB1 receptor agonists might be used therapeutically to retard tumor growth in vivo by inhibiting at once tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2138448256,"Colorectal cancer is the second most frequent cancer in the Western world, often lethal when invasion and/or metastasis occur. In addition to hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), colon cancer invasion may be driven by prostaglandins, especially the E2 series (PGE2), generated by the cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) enzyme. While concentration of PGE2 as well as expression of Cox-2, HGF receptor (c-Met-R), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and beta-catenin are all dramatically increased in colon cancers and implicated in their growth and invasion, the precise role of PGE2 in the latter process remains unclear. Here we provide evidence that PGE2 transactivates c-Met-R (contingent upon functional EGFR), increases tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin, and induces urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) mRNA expression. This is accompanied by increased beta-catenin association with c-Met-R and enhanced colon cancer cell invasiveness. Inactivation of EGFR and c-Met-R significantly reduced PGE2-induced cancer cell invasiveness. Clinical relevance of these findings is confirmed by our immunohistochemical studies demonstrating that cancer cells in the invasive front overexpress Cox-2, c-Met-R, and beta-catenin. Our findings explain a functional relationship between prostaglandins, EGFR, and c-Met-R in colon cancer growth and invasion."
https://openalex.org/W2164604975,"Delivery of drugs to the brain is impeded by the activity of efflux pumps expressed by endothelial cells of brain vasculature. The ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters, among which ABCB1/MDR1 P-glycoprotein and ABCC1/multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 are expressed in brain endothelial cells, participate in drug efflux properties of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Searches of the EST (expressed sequence tags) database with the conserved ABC domain, conducted to identify other ABC transporters expressed in the BBB, recovered 15 ABC transporter sequences expressed in human brain cDNA libraries. One of these sequences, identical to ABCG2, was highly expressed in cultured human cerebromicrovascular endothelial cells and human brain tissue at both mRNA and protein levels. Overexpression of human ABCG2 in immortalized rat brain endothelial cells resulted in enhanced polarized abluminal to luminal transport of various substrates tested in the in vitro BBB model. Brain vessels extracted from tissue sections of nonmalignant human brain and glioblastoma tumors by laser capture microdissection microscopy and analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction showed higher expression of ABCG2 relative to ABCB1/MDR1 and ABCC1/MRP1. ABCG2 was up-regulated in both glioblastoma vessels and parenchymal tissue. These studies suggest a role for brain endothelial ABCG2 transporter in modulating drug delivery to the brain and in conferring drug resistance to glioblastomas."
https://openalex.org/W2038062572,"Electrical conductance is greatly altered in end-stage heart failure, but little is known about the underlying events. We therefore investigated the expression of genes coding for major inward and outward ion channels, calcium binding proteins, ion receptors, ion exchangers, calcium ATPases, and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases in explanted hearts (n=13) of patients diagnosed with end-stage heart failure. With the exception of Kv11.1 and Kir3.1 and when compared with healthy controls, major sodium, potassium, and calcium ion channels, ion transporters, and exchangers were significantly repressed, but expression of Kv7.1, HCN4, troponin C and I, SERCA1, and phospholamban was elevated. Hierarchical gene cluster analysis provided novel insight into regulated gene networks. Significant induction of the transcriptional repressor m-Bop and the translational repressor NAT1 coincided with repressed cardiac gene expression. The statistically significant negative correlation between repressors and ion channels points to a mechanism of disease. We observed coregulation of ion channels and the androgen receptor and propose a role for this receptor in ion channel regulation. Overall, the reversal of repressed ion channel gene expression in patients with implanted assist devices exemplifies the complex interactions between pressure load/stretch force and heart-specific gene expression."

The spatial, temporal gradients of shear stress, topology, and outcome of cellular interactions that underlie these responses have so far been inferred from static imaging of tissue sections or studies of statically cultured cells. In this report, we developed micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) sensors, comparable to a single endothelial cell (EC) in size, to link real-time shear stress with monocyte/EC binding kinetics in a complex flow environment, simulating the moving and unsteady separation point at the arterial bifurcation with high spatial and temporal resolution. In response to oscillatory shear stress (tau) at +/- 2.6 dyn/cm2 at a time-averaged shear stress (tau(ave))=0 and 0.5 Hz, individual monocytes displayed unique to-and-fro trajectories undergoing rolling, binding, and dissociation with other monocyte, followed by solid adhesion on EC. Our study quantified individual monocyte/EC binding kinetics in terms of displacement and velocity profiles. Oscillatory flow induces up-regulation of adhesion molecules and cytokines to mediate monocyte/EC interactions over a dynamic range of shear stress +/- 2.6 dyn/cm2 (P=0.50, n=10)."

Although found in different phyla (animal, plant, and fungus), ICK peptides appear to be most prominent in venoms of cone snail and spider. Recently, two scorpion toxins activating a calcium release channel have been found to adopt an ICK fold. We have isolated and identified both cDNA and genomic clones for this family of ICK peptides from the scorpion Opistophthalmus carinatus. The gene characterized by three well-delineated exons respectively coding for three structural and functional domains in the toxin precursors illustrates the correlation between exon and module as suggested by the ""exon theory of genes."" Based on the analysis of precursor organization and gene structure combined with the 3-D fold and functional data, our results highlight a common evolutionary origin for ICK peptides from animals. In contrast, ICK peptides from plant and fungus might be independently evolved from another ancestor."

Here, B cell lines made deficient in TRAF2 using a novel homologous recombination system reveal new roles for TRAF2. We demonstrate that TRAF2 participates in synergy between CD40 and B cell antigen receptor signals, and in CD40-mediated, TNF-dependent IgM production. We also find that TRAF2 participates in the degradation of TRAF3 associated with CD40 signaling, a role that may limit inhibitory actions of TRAF3. Finally, we show that TRAF2 and TRAF6 have overlapping functions in CD40-mediated NF-κB activation and CD80 up-regulation.

In B lymphocytes, CD40 engagement results in the transcriptional up-regulation of costimulatory molecules (CD80 and CD86), adhesion receptors (CD54, CD11a/CD18, CD23), and cytokines (interleukin-6 and TNF) (7Bishop G.A. Hostager B.S. Arch. Immunol. Ther. Exp. 2001; 49: 129-137PubMed Google Scholar). Increased expression of these proteins is partially attributed to activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and the transcription factor NF-κB. However, the mechanisms allowing CD40 to activate these factors remain unclear. Like other members of the TNFR family, signaling from CD40 involves proteins of the TNFR-associated factor (TRAF) family. This group of molecules serves as adapter proteins linking CD40 to downstream signaling events. TRAFs 2, 3, and 5 all bind to the membrane-distal CD40 cytoplasmic domain, whereas TRAF6 binds a membrane-proximal site. TRAFs 2–6 contain four major structural motifs.

Near the N terminus, TRAFs 2–6 contain a zinc RING motif and several zinc fingers. The zinc binding domains of TRAF2 participate in its ubiquitination when recruited to the CD40 signaling complex (12Brown K.D. Hostager B.S. Bishop G.A. J. Biol.

In a variety of experiments, TRAF2 has been associated with the activation of JNK and NF-κB by TNFR family members (14Inoue J. Ishida T. Tsukamoto N. Kobayashi N. Naito A. Azuma S. Yamamoto T. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 254: 14-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Additional information concerning the role of TRAF2 in TNFR family signaling has been sought using TRAF2–/– mice (15Yeh W.C. Shahinian A. Speiser D. Kraunus J. Billia F. Wakeham A. Delapompa J.L. Ferrick D. Hum B. Iscove N. Ohashi P. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. Mak T.W.

These experiments support a role for TRAF2 in JNK activation by TNF, as well as a contribution to TNF- or CD40-induced NF-κB activation. Unfortunately, because TRAF2–/– mice die shortly after birth, more detailed analysis of CD40 signaling in their B cells has been difficult. The viability of the mice improves if produced on a TNF–/– or TNFR1–/– background, and B cells from such mice display defects in CD40-mediated NF-κB activation and proliferation (16Nguyen L.T. Duncan G.S. Mirtsos C. Ng M. Speiser D.E. Shahinian A. Marino M.W. Mak T.W. Ohashi P.S. Yey W.-C. Immunity. 1999; 11: 379-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). However, interpretation of these results is complicated by the fact that, in normal B cells, CD40 stimulates the production of TNF, which in turn contributes to their activation (17Hostager B.S. Bishop G.A. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 3318-3322Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). It is also unclear if the activation defects in TRAF2–/–/TNF–/– (or TRAF2–/–/TNFR1–/–) B cells are directly related to the absence of TRAF2 in the CD40 signaling complex or if the combined deficiencies disrupt function of mature B cells in more indirect ways. An alternate method of assessing the contributions of TRAF molecules has been to examine the function of transgenic CD40 molecules with mutations in putative TRAF binding sites (18Yasui T. Muraoka M.

However, levels of transgene expression and residual TRAF binding by CD40 mutants (21Haxhinasto S.A. Hostager B.S. Bishop G.A. J.

To examine receptor signaling in the complete absence of individual or multiple TRAFs and to avoid the severe viability and development defects of TRAF–/– mice we have developed methodology to allow the efficient targeted disruption of TRAF (and other) genes in somatic cell lines. We have successfully applied this method to produce two mouse B cell lines specifically deficient in TRAF2. Using these B cells, in addition to their subclones stably expressing transfected wild-type (Wt) and mutant TRAF and CD40 molecules, we evaluated the contributions of TRAF2 to several CD40-mediated events not previously examined in TRAF–/– mice or mice bearing mutant CD40 transgenes. We found that the CD40-dependent degradation of TRAF3 is inhibited in cells lacking TRAF2, an observation relevant to the ubiquitination and degradation events recently found to be associated with TNFR family signaling (12Brown K.D.

We also found that, although some CD40 signals are TRAF2-independent, synergy between CD40 and the BCR in IgM production did not occur in TRAF2–/– B cells. The TNF-dependent component of CD40-mediated IgM secretion was also found to be TRAF2-dependent, and CD40-mediated JNK activation was diminished in TRAF2–/– B cells. Interestingly, we found that TRAF2 and TRAF6 make overlapping contributions to CD40-mediated NF-κB activation, reconciling and explaining the apparently disparate results of prior studies. These findings provide new information on the multiple roles played by TRAF2, using a novel approach applicable to the study of many other signaling receptors and pathways.

A. 1986; 83: 7410-7414Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The diploid mouse B cell line A20.2J (27Kim K.J. Kanellopoulos-Langevin C. Merwin R.M. Sachs D.H. Asofsky R. J. Immunol. 1979; 122: 549-554PubMed Google Scholar) was the gift of Dr. David McKean (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN). CH12.LX is diploid or near-diploid (karyotype analysis performed by Dr. Baoli Yang, University of Iowa). B cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 10 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, and antibiotics. Sf9 insect cells were cultured in Grace's supplemented medium (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) containing 10% fetal calf serum. High Five insect cells were grown in Express Five medium (Invitrogen). CD154-expressing Cells—Insect cells expressing mouse CD154 (mCD154) were prepared as described previously (28Hostager B.S. Hsing Y. Harms D.E. Bishop G.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 1047-1053PubMed Google Scholar). A similar baculoviral expression construct was prepared for human CD154 (hCD154), using a commercially available kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Recombinant baculovirus and CD154-expressing insect cells (either Sf9 or High Five) were prepared by the Iowa Diabetes and Endocrinology Research Center (University of Iowa and Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Iowa City, IA). In all experiments using CD154-expressing cells, insect cells infected with wild-type baculovirus were used as negative controls. These cells were used in some experiments to again demonstrate that CD154 and anti-CD40 yield similar results in our assays, as shown in our previous reports (12Brown K.D. Hostager B.S. Bishop G.A.

Reagents and Materials—Proteinase K was from Roche Applied Science (Indianapolis, IN). DNA oligonucleotide primers were obtained from IDT (Coralville, IA). Elongase DNA polymerase was from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). G418 sulfate was from Invitrogen. Anti-TRAF2 antibody (Ab) used in Western blotting was from Medical and Biological Laboratories Co., Ltd. (Nagoya, Japan). Western blotting Abs for c-Jun kinase, TRAF3, and TRAF6 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Sheep Ab used in human CD40 (hCD40) Western blots was described previously (13Hostager B.S. Catlett I.M. Bishop G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15392-15398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Abs for phospho-JNK, IκBα, and phospho-IκBα were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Anti-actin Ab was from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). mAbs against mCD40 (1C10 (29Heath A.W. Wu W.W. Howard M.C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 1828-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), rat IgG2a), hCD40 (G28–5 (ATCC, Manassas, VA), mouse IgG1), and mouse IgE (EM-95.3 (30Baniyash M. Eshhar Z. Eur. J. Immunol. 1984; 14: 799-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), rat IgG2a) were purified from hybridoma culture supernatants. Mouse IgG1 isotype control Ab (MOPC-21) and anti-FLAG Ab (M2) were from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-mCD80 and control Ab were from eBioscience (San Diego, CA). Hamster anti-mCD40 and control Ab were from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA). Horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit and goat anti-mouse Abs were from Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA), and horseradish peroxidase-labeled rabbit anti-sheep Ab was from Upstate (Waltham, MA). Recombinant mouse TNF was from R&D Systems (St. Paul, MN). Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was from Amresco (Solon, OH). Cycloheximide was from Sigma. Protran nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher and Schuell, Keene, NH) was used for JNK Western blots. Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) was used for all remaining Western blots. Preparation of Genomic DNA—Approximately 1 × 105 cells were suspended in 25 μl of digestion buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS) containing 60 μg/ml proteinase K (added immediately before use). The digests were incubated at 56 °C for 1 h, then 10 min at 90 °C. Genomic DNA templates were used at a final dilution of 1:100 in PCR. PCR—PCR amplification of genomic DNA was performed with Elongase (Invitrogen), using the manufacturer's protocols. Targeting Vectors—pUC19 was modified by the insertion of a promoterless neomycin resistance gene (flanked by loxP sites (31Sauer B. Henderson N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 147-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar)) and an SV40 polyadenylation (pA) site. Portions of these inserts were derived from p656 and IRES-neo-pA, provided by Dr. John Sedivy (Brown University, Providence, RI). A diphtheria toxin-subunit A (DTA) gene was inserted into the targeting vector to select against cells carrying randomly inserted vector (32Yanagawa Y. Kobayashi T. Ohnishi M. Kobayashi T. Tamura S. Tsuzuki T. Sanbo M. Yagi T. Tashiro F. Miyazaki J.-I. Trans. Res. 1999; 8: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The toxin gene was positioned to be disrupted during the process of homologous recombination, but remain intact (and lethal) should the vector randomly integrate into the genome. Although a herpes simplex thymidine kinase cassette is often used for the same purpose, DTA proved more efficient in the B cell lines used and did not require the addition of gancyclovir to the culture medium. The diphtheria toxin cassette was provided by Drs. Matthew Anderson and Susumu Tonegawa (Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA). Two versions of the basic targeting vector were produced, pPNTV1 (promoterless neomycin phosphotransferase targeting vector 1) and pPNTV2. In pPNTV1, diphtheria toxin (DTA) gene expression was driven by the phosphoglycerate kinase promoter, and in pPNTV2 (Fig. 1A) by a weaker, modified RSV promoter from pOPRSV1.mcs1 (33Busch L.K. Bishop G.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2555-2561PubMed Google Scholar). To produce TRAF2-specific targeting vectors, genomic DNA sequences from the mouse TRAF2 gene (from the mouse B cell line M12.4.1 (34Hamano T. Kim K.J. Leiserson W.M. Asofsky R. J. Immunol. 1982; 129: 1403-1406PubMed Google Scholar)) were inserted into endonuclease restriction sites flanking the neomycin resistance cassette in pPNTV1 or pPNTV2. Three TRAF2-specific targeting vectors were produced, pT2delA, -B, and -C. pPNTV1 was used for constructing pT2delA, and pPNTV2 was used for B and C. Fig. 1B illustrates the segments of the TRAF2 gene inserted into the three targeting vectors. PCR primers used in generating the 5′ genomic flank in pT2delA and C were pT2delA-5′F (tagtcgaccgtgaagtggtgctgatggt) and pT2delA-5′R (ctacccgggcagccatgtgagttacaacccccaca). PCR primers for the 3′ flank in pT2delA were T2delA-3′F (atggtaccgtctatgaaaggggccagtgtagt) and T2delA-3′R (aatctagaacagggtgctctgcagtg). Primers for the 5′ flank in pT2delB were T2delB-5′F (ttgtcgactgtgtgggggttgtaactcac) and T2delB-5′R (aatctagagtttaaactcagtcattcaatagacacaggcagc). Primers for the 3′ flank in pT2delB and pT2delC were T2delB-3′F (tttggtacccagaactgtgctgcctgtgtc) and T2delB-3′R (aaggtaccaacagtttacagaaggtaagactaatg). In all targeting vectors, the 5′ genomic flanks were inserted so that the TRAF2 coding sequence was in-frame with the neomycin phosphotransferase (NeoR) sequence. A promoterless NeoR cassette was used to reduce the number of anti-biotic-resistant clones resulting from random integration of the targeting constructs (35Sedivy J.M. Dutriaux A. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 88-90Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). With homologous recombination, the endogenous TRAF2 promoter drives expression of a fusion protein consisting of a short segment of TRAF2 fused to NeoR. It has been shown that NeoR is particularly useful as an antibiotic resistance marker in promoterless gene targeting vectors, because even relatively weak genomic promoters drive sufficient expression to confer drug resistance (36Hanson K.D. Sedivy J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The loxP sites flanking NeoR permit its removal after targeting each copy of the TRAF2 gene, and therefore allow neomycin selection to be used throughout the targeting process. Transient transfection of cells with a plasmid encoding Cre recombinase mediates recombination at the loxP sites and deletion of NeoR. Following the recombination event, the SV40 polyadenylation sequence remains in the TRAF2 gene to maintain disruption of expression. Removal of NeoR after the second round of targeting permits subsequent transfection of the cells with other neomycin-selectable expression plasmids. TRAF2 and CD40 Vectors—IPTG-inducible TRAF2 and C-terminally 3XFLAG-tagged (37Hernan R. Heuermann K. Brizzard B. BioTechniques. 2000; 28: 789-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) TRAF2 constructs were prepared using an expression system similar to that previously described (33Busch L.K. Bishop G.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2555-2561PubMed Google Scholar, 38Hsing Y. Bishop G.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2804-2811PubMed Google Scholar). The IPTG-inducible “dominant-negative” (DN) TRAF2 expression vector was previously described (22Hostager B.S. Bishop G.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 6307-6311PubMed Google Scholar). Using PCR-based mutagenesis, expression vectors encoding hybrid CD40 molecules were prepared. One hybrid consists of the extracellular domain of hCD40 fused to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic (CY) domains of mCD40 (hmCD40). The second hybrid, hmCD40ΔT6, contains point mutations at two residues in the putative TRAF6 binding site (39Manning E. Pullen S.S. Souza D.J. Kehry M. Noelle R.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Both constructs were inserted into the pRSV.5(neo) expression vector (40Long E.O. Rosen B.-S. Karp D.R. Malnati M. Sekaly R.P. Jaraquemada D. Hum. Immunol. 1991; 31: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). An expression vector encoding hCD40Δ22 was previously described (28Hostager B.S. Hsing Y. Harms D.E. Bishop G.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 1047-1053PubMed Google Scholar). Stable transfection of cells with CD40 and TRAF2 constructs by electroporation was performed as described below. Transfection of Cells with Targeting Vectors—Cells (1.5 × 107) were suspended in 400 μl of RPMI supplemented with 1.54 mg/ml glutathione, 5 μg of linearized targeting vector, and 5 μg of double-stranded DNA oligonucleotide of random sequence (62 bp; synthesized by IDT). The addition of the oligonucleotide to the transfection mixture appeared to increase the frequency of homologous recombination. Transfections performed without the oligonucleotide, although resulting in neomycin-resistant clones, frequently yielded no homologous recombinants. With the oligonucleotide in the transfection mixture, the ratio of homologous recombination to random integration approached 1:10 in some cases. We speculate that the oligonucleotide may serve as a sequence-independent decoy for cellular nucleases that would otherwise degrade or damage the targeting vector. It is also possible that the short oligonucleotide strands induce DNA repair enzymes that facilitate the process of homologous recombination. Cells were electroporated using an ECM 830 electroporator (Genetronics, San Diego, CA). Settings for CH12.LX cells were 200 V/30 ms, and for A20.2J cells, 225 V/30 ms (4-mm gap cuvettes). After electroporation, cells were placed on ice for 5–10 min then diluted in 10 ml of culture medium supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum and cultured overnight. Cells were subcloned in medium containing 400 μg of G418 sulfate. Approximately 10–14 days after electroporation, neomycin-resistant clones were screened for homologous recombination. Screening for Homologous Recombination—A PCR-based assay was used to screen clones for homologous recombination. Screening of pT2delA and -C transfectants was performed with the PCR primers T2delA-5′S (cttagttttcacaatgccttcg) and rNeo (caatccatcttgttcagccat). T2delA-5′S is complementary to genomic sequence immediately upstream of the sequence used as the 5′ flank in the targeting vectors, and the 3′ primer is complementary to a portion of NeoR. PCR amplification of genomic DNA from homologous recombinants produced a product of ∼4500 bp (not shown). As positive controls, several genomic DNA samples from each transfection were PCR-amplified with T2delA-5′S and the T2delA-5′R. PCR screening of pT2delB transfectants was accomplished using rNeo and T2delB-5′S (gaattgaggtgtgatatggtctgtg). PCR amplification of genomic DNA from homologous recombinants produced a product of ∼2000 bp. In positive control reactions, T2delB-5′S and T2delB-5′R were used. Removal of NeoR—To mediate recombination at the loxP sequences, cells were transiently transfected with pBS185, coding for Cre recombinase (41Sauer B. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 225: 890-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). 1 × 107 cells were suspended in 400 μl of RPMI containing 1.54 mg/ml glutathione and 15 μg of pBS185. Cells were electroporated as above then subcloned in medium without G418. After ∼10 days of culture, clones were tested for G418 sensitivity. Typically, 5–10% of the clones were G418-sensitive. TRAF3 Degradation Assay—Cells (5 × 106) were stimulated for 6 h in a volume of 0.5 ml at 37 °C with 10 μg/ml hamster anti-mCD40 or an isotype control Ab. Where indicated, new protein synthesis was blocked by adding 1.0 μm cycloheximide to the cell cultures 30 min prior to the addition of the stimulatory antibody (42Catlett I.M. Xie P. Hostager B.S. Bishop G.A. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 6019-6024Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The cells were then pelleted by centrifugation, and whole-cell lysates were prepared by resuspending the cells in 200 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer and sonicating briefly. 2.5 × 105 cell equivalents were loaded per lane on SDS-PAGE gels. TRAF3 was quantitated on Western blots using a low light imaging system (LAS-1000, FujiFilm Medical Systems USA, Inc., Stamford, CT). Western blots were simultaneously probed for actin, which allowed for normalization of the TRAF3 signal in each lane. JNK Assay—Activated JNK was detected on Western blots using a polyclonal antiserum specific for JNK phosphorylated on Thr183 and Tyr185. Briefly, 1 × 106 B cells were assayed per stimulation condition. Cells were stimulated for various times in a volume of 1 ml at 37 °C with 5 μg/ml hamster anti-mCD40 or an isotype control Ab. Following stimulation, cells were pelleted by centrifugation, and whole cell lysates were prepared as in TRAF3 degradation experiments. 1 × 105 cell equivalents were loaded per lane on SDS-PAGE gels. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose for Western blotting with antibodies for anti-phospho-JNK and total JNK. NFκB Activation Assay—NFκB activation was measured by the phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα appearing on Western blots of whole cell lysates, using anti-phospho-IκBα and anti-IκBα Abs according to the manufacturer's instructions. 1 × 106 cells were stimulated at 37 °C in a volume of 1 ml, using 5 μg/ml anti-CD40 mAbs (1C10 and G28–5) or isotype control mAbs. Whole cell lysates were prepared as in JNK assays. IgM Secretion Assay—Quantitation of IgM-secreting CH12.LX cells was accomplished as described previously (43Bishop G.A. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 1107-1114PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, B cells were incubated with various stimuli for 72 h, and viable cells were counted by trypan blue exclusion, mixed with sheep erythrocytes (SRBC) and guinea pig complement, and transferred to chamber slides. Slides were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Activated CH12.LX cells secrete IgM specific for phosphatidylcholine present on SRBC and create lytic plaques on a lawn of SRBC in the presence of complement. In experiments with cells expressing IPTG-inducible TRAF2, cells were incubated for 24 h with 100 μm IPTG, then stimulated for 48 h. Stimuli used were anti-CD40 (1C10 or G28–5, 2 μg/ml), mouse- or human CD154-expressing insect cells (1 insect cell per 10 B cells), SRBC (antigen, 0.1%), and recombinant mouse TNF (50 pg/ml). Results are presented as the ratio of plaque-forming cells (pfc) to viable recovered cells. Immunoprecipitation—For examining TRAF-CD40 interactions by coimmunoprecipitation, cells (2 × 107) were stimulated for 20 min (37 °C) with 1 × 106 High Five cells infected with wild-type baculovirus or baculovirus encoding hCD154. Cells were lysed and hCD40 was immunoprecipitated from membrane microdomains as described (44Busch L.K. Bishop G.A. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 5805-5813Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). CD80 Up-regulation—Cells were stimulated for 72 h with 5 μg/ml anti-mCD40 (1C10), anti-hCD40, or appropriate isotype controls and assayed by flow cytometry as described previously (28Hostager B.S. Hsing Y. Harms D.E. Bishop G.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 1047-1053PubMed Google Scholar). Flow Cytometry—Staining of cells for flow cytometry was described (28Hostager B.S. Hsing Y. Harms D.E. Bishop G.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 1047-1053PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were analyzed with a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and WinMDI software (The Scripps Research Institute, San Diego, CA). Generation of TRAF2 – / – Cells by Homologous Recombination—To generate TRAF2–/– B cell lines, we constructed targeting vectors containing segments of the mouse TRAF2 gene interrupted by neomycin resistance cassettes. The DNA constructs were designed to undergo homologous recombination with the TRAF2 genes in cells, disrupting TRAF2 production. Although disruption of genes by homologous recombination has been very successful in murine embryonic stem cells, it has been used infrequently in somatic cell lines due to the often abysmal ratio of homologous to non-homologous recombination events (35Sedivy J.M. Dutriaux A. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 88-90Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). We used a number of strategies to improve the frequency of hom"
https://openalex.org/W2100399069,"Recruitment of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC) by endothelial cells (EC) is essential for angiogenesis. Endothelial-derived heparin binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF) was shown to mediate this process by signaling via ErbB1 and ErbB2 receptors in SMCs. 1) Analysis of ErbB-ligands demonstrated that primary ECs expressed only HB-EGF and neuregulin-1. 2) Primary SMCs expressed ErbB1 and ErbB2, but not ErbB3 or ErbB4. 3) Consistent with their known receptor specificities, recombinant HB-EGF, but not neuregulin-1, stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB1 and ErbB2 and migration in SMCs. 4) Neutralization of HB-EGF or inhibition of ErbB1 or ErbB2 blocked 70-90% of the potential of ECs to stimulate SMC migration. Moreover, 5) angiopoietin-1, an EC effector with a role in recruitment of SMC-like cells to vascular structures in vivo, enhanced EC-stimulated SMC migration by a mechanism involving up-regulation of endothelial HB-EGF. Finally, 6) immunohistochemical analysis of developing human tissues demonstrated that HB-EGF was expressed in vivo in ECs associated with SMCs or pericytes but not in ECs of the hyaloid vessels not associated with SMCs. These results suggest an important role for HB-EGF and ErbB receptors in the recruitment of SMCs by ECs and elaborate on the mechanism by which angiopoietins exert their vascular effects."
https://openalex.org/W1986704854,"The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway participates in the metabolic effects of contraction on muscle glucose uptake. We have shown that contraction increases both GLUT4 translocation to the cell surface and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) activity. The latter pathway may be involved in the activation of GLUT4. Here we investigated whether the AMPK activator AICAR increases glucose uptake by inducing translocation of GLUT4 and/or by activating the p38 MAPK pathway. AICAR infusion into glucose-clamped rats increased muscle glucose uptake and GLUT4 translocation from an intracellular fraction to the plasma membrane but not to T-tubules. AICAR also caused recruitment of the transferrin receptor to the plasma membrane and increased [125I]-transferrin uptake in isolated muscle. AICAR treatment in vivo or in vitro activated both p38 MAPKalpha and beta (1.6- to 2.8-fold) in EDL muscles with a time course identical to that of stimulation of AMPK and glucose transport. The p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 abrogated the stimulatory effect of AICAR on glucose uptake. These results suggest that AICAR increases muscle glucose uptake by two mechanisms: 1) inducing selective recruitment of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane, and 2) activating p38 MAPKalpha and beta, which may be involved in the activation of GLUT4."
https://openalex.org/W1989622278,"β2-Microglobulin (β2-m), a typical immunoglobulin domain made of seven β-strands, is a major component of amyloid fibrils formed in dialysis-related amyloidosis. To understand the mechanism of amyloid fibril formation in the context of full-length protein, we prepared various mutants in which proline (Pro) was introduced to each of the seven β-strands of β2-m. The mutations affected the amyloidogenic potential of β2-m to various degrees. In particular, the L23P, H51P, and V82P mutations significantly retarded fibril extension at pH 2.5. Among these, only L23P is included in the known “minimal” peptide sequence, which can form amyloid fibrils when isolated as a short peptide. This indicates that the residues in regions other than the minimal sequence, such as H51P and V82P, determine the amyloidogenic potential in the full-length protein. To further clarify the mutational effects, we measured their stability against guanidine hydrochloride of the native state at pH 8.0 and the amyloid fibrils at pH 2.5. The amyloidogenicity of mutants showed a significant correlation with the stability of the amyloid fibrils, and little correlation was observed with that of the native state. It has been proposed that the stability of the native state and the unfolding rate to the amyloidogenic precursor as well as the conformational preference of the denatured state determine the amyloidogenicity of the proteins. The present results reveal that, in addition, stability of the amyloid fibrils is a key factor determining the amyloidogenic potential of the proteins. β2-Microglobulin (β2-m), a typical immunoglobulin domain made of seven β-strands, is a major component of amyloid fibrils formed in dialysis-related amyloidosis.

More than 20 diseases are related to the deposition of insoluble amyloid fibrils (1Kelly J.W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 2Kelly J.W. Curr.

In some cases, such as Alzheimer's disease, fibril components are the truncated relatively short fragments of amyloid precursor proteins. In other types of amyloidosis, such as familial amyloid polyneuropathy and dialysis-related amyloidosis, amyloid fibrils are made of the entire part of the originally globular proteins. For these proteins, it has been shown that short peptides, called minimal (or essential) sequences, can also form amyloid fibrils (4Selvaggini C. De Gioia L. Cantu L. Ghibaudi E. Diomede L.

These findings raise the question of whether regions other than the minimal sequence affect the amyloid fibril formation.For many amyloidogenic globular proteins, destabilization of the native globular state by mutation or by introduction of unstable conditions is highly correlated with the formation of amyloid fibrils, suggesting that the denaturation or unfolding of the native state is the critical event in triggering amyloid formation (8Booth D.R.

A study with a series of transthyretin mutants revealed that the unfolding rate rather than the thermodynamic stability is an important factor determining amyloidogenicity (13Hammarström P. Jiang X.

Alternatively, because the non-native state is an intermediate or precursor of amyloid fibril formation, residues other than the minimal region can control amyloid fibril formation by affecting the conformational properties of the non-native state. Consistent with this, recent studies with various mutants of acylphosphatase demonstrated that the hydrophobicity and β-sheet propensity of the key regions, which are distinct from those parts important for protein folding, as well as the net charge of the protein are the critical factors for aggregation (14Chiti F.

Moreover, it is likely that mutations affecting the stability of the amyloid fibrils also determine the amyloidogenicity of proteins.Dialysis-related amyloidosis is a common and serious complication in patients receiving long term hemodialysis for more than 10 years (16Gejyo F.

The straight needle-like amyloid fibrils can be formed in vitro by the seed-dependent extension reaction at pH 2.5, in which monomeric β2-m is added to the end(s) of seed fibrils (19Naiki H. Hashimoto N. Suzuki S. Kimura H. Nakakuki K. Gejyo F. Amyloid. 1997; 4: 223-232Crossref Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The similar amyloid fibrils are formed spontaneously with a lag phase at pH 2.5 and low ionic strength (20Kad N.M. Myers S.L. Smith D.P. Alastair Smith D. Radford S.E. Thomson N.H. J. Mol.

Recently, we identified that an 11-residue peptide, Asn-21-His-31, in the K3 region also forms amyloid fibrils (21Hasegawa K. Ohhashi Y. Yamaguchi I. Takahashi N. Tsutsumi S. Goto Y. Gejyo F. Naiki H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 304: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In addition, Jones et al. (5Jones S. Manning J. Kad N.M. Radford S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) identify another peptide, Asp-59-Thr-71, forms amyloid fibrils.In amyloid fibrils of β2-m, more than 50% of amide protons, mostly located at the central regions of the protein, are highly protected from hydrogen/deuterium exchange (Fig. 1A), which is distinct from the protected amide protons of the native state protein (Fig. 1) (22Hoshino M. Katou H. Hagihara Y. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 332-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The distribution of preferential proteolytic sites confirmed the protected central regions and the exposed N- and C-terminal regions (23Monti M. Principe S. Giorgetti S. Mangione P. Merlini G. Clark A. Bellotti V. Amoresano A. Pucci P. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2362-2369Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, the reduced β2-m, in which the disulfide bond between Cys-25 and Cys-80 (Fig. 1) is reduced, cannot form straight needle-like amyloid fibrils (24Ohhashi Y. Hagihara Y. Kozhukh G. Hoshino M. Hasegawa K. Yamaguchi I. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 131: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), although this molecule has both of these two minimal sequence regions. Instead, the reduced β2-m forms flexible, thin filaments, suggesting that the mature fibril is made of several filaments (20Kad N.M. Myers S.L. Smith D.P. Alastair Smith D. Radford S.E. Thomson N.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 785-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 25Katou H. Kanno T. Hoshino M. Hagihara Y. Tanaka H. Kawai T. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y.

The recovery of the fibril formation of the K3 peptide (Ser-20-Lys-41) upon removal of the nonessential regions indicates that regions other than the minimal region control fibril formation.β2-m, at neutral pH, assumes a typical immunoglobulin domain-fold consisting of seven β-strands (Fig. 1B) (26Bjorkman P.J.

Bellotti V. Esposito G. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 487-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). To examine the role of each β-strand, we prepared mutants that have a proline (Pro) substitution at the central hydrophobic amino acid, except for the β D strand. Because the β D strand forms the β-bulge, which separates this strand into two parts, we prepared three mutants, V49P, H51P, and L54P. Because Pro is the least favored amino acid at the center of the β-strand (29Minor Jr., D.L. Kim P.S. Nature. 1994; 371: 264-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 30Minor Jr., D.L. Kim P.S. Nature. 1994; 367: 660-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar), each Pro substitution in β2-m (Pro mutation) should affect the formation of amyloid fibrils to a different extent depending on the role of each region. The seed-dependent extension reaction, performed at pH 2.5, is a reproducible and quantitative experiment suitable for characterizing the amyloid fibril formation kinetics of β2-m. However, amyloid fibrils formed at pH 2.5 are unstable at neutral pH, suggesting that additional cellular components are involved in stabilization of the amyloid fibrils in vivo. Therefore, nine mutants were examined for their ability to form amyloid fibrils at pH 2.5 by the seed-dependent extension reaction. To further understand the mechanism of the mutational effects, we measured the stability against guanidine hydrochloride (Gdn-HCl) denaturation of the amyloid fibrils at pH 2.5 and the native states at pH 8. Because of the instability of the native state at pH 2.5 (24Ohhashi Y. Hagihara Y. Kozhukh G. Hoshino M. Hasegawa K. Yamaguchi I. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 131: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), the experiments at pH 2.5, although not physiological, can directly extract the effects of mutations on the fibril formation and the stability of amyloid fibrils, separated from the effects on the native state.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstruction of an Expression Plasmid for Wild-type β2-m—For the production of recombinant β2-m, Pichia pastoris was used (7Kozhukh G.V.

Hoshino M. Hasegawa K. Yamaguchi I. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 131: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, this expression system was unsuitable for producing unstable mutants, because the cellular quality control system disallows the release of unstable protein from the secretory pathway (31Hagihara Y. Shiraki K. Nakamura T. Uegaki K. Takagi M. Imanaka T. Yumoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 51043-51048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 32Hagihara Y. Kim P.S. Proc.

Science. 1999; 286: 1882-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar). Because the Pro-mutation may destabilize the native structure of β2-m, and thus, the proteins may not be secreted in the P. pastoris expression system, an Escherichia coli expression system was selected for producing recombinant β2-m and its mutants. cDNA encoding β2-m was amplified by PCR using Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene Cloning Systems, La Jolla, CA). The amplified DNA fragment was cloned into the E. coli expression vector pAED4 (34Doering D.S. Matsudaira P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12677-12685Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). A Met residue was always present at the N-terminal position of the recombinant protein, which was referred to as M0. Nine Pro mutants, V9P, L23P, L39P, V49P, H51P, L54P, L65P, V82P, and V93P, were prepared using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Fig. 1 shows the distribution of these mutations on the sequence of β2-m.Expression and Purification of Wild-type β2-m and Pro Mutants— Prepared mutants were expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS (Novagen, Inc., Madison, WI). Wild-type and all mutant β2-ms accumulated in inclusion bodies. These inclusion bodies were dissolved in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 8 m urea and air-oxidized for 2-3 days at 4 °C. Formation of the intrachain disulfide bond was confirmed by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (35Hong D.P. Gozu M. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21554-21560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). After air oxidation, the sample was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8) to refold the proteins. The refolded sample was then subjected to DEAESepharose CL-6B (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and the proteins were eluted with a linear concentration gradient of NaCl (0-200 mm). The fraction containing the major peak was dialyzed against deionized water and lyophilized. The lyophilized protein sample was dissolved in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) and applied to a HiPrep 26/60 Sephacryl S-100 high resolution column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), and the fraction containing the major peak was collected, dialyzed against deionized water, and lyophilized.The molecular weight of the purified proteins was measured by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and was correct in each case (±0.025%). Monomer concentrations of wild-type and mutant β2-ms were determined by measuring the UV absorption using a U-3000 spectrophotometer (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan), at 25 °C. The protein extinction coefficient (ϵ = 19,300 m-1 cm-1) was calculated from amino acid sequence data (36Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5023) Google Scholar).Fluorometric Analysis of Fibrillogenesis with Thioflavin T—Amyloid fibril formation by wild-type and mutant β2-ms was carried out using the seed-dependent fibril extension method (37Naiki H.

The reaction was monitored by fluorometric analysis with thioflavin T (ThT). Native β2-m fibrils were originally purified from Baker's cyst wall excised from the popliteal fossa of a patient suffering from dialysis-related amyloidosis (16Gejyo F. Yamada T. Odani S. Nakagawa Y. Arakawa M. Kunitomo T. Kataoka H. Suzuki M. Hirasawa Y. Shirahama T. Cohen A.S. Schmid K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 129: 701-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). In this study the seed fibrils were prepared by the repeated extension reaction of the seeds previously generated with native β2-m fibrils, and β2-m expressed in P. pastoris (7Kozhukh G.V.

Hoshino M. Hasegawa K. Yamaguchi I. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 131: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) with monomeric wild-type β2-m that was expressed in E. coli.Briefly, the extension reaction was started by increasing the temperature to 37 °C by placing the samples in an air incubator. From each reaction tube, an aliquot of 7.5 μl was taken and mixed with 1.5 ml of 5 μm ThT in 50 mm glycine-NaOH buffer (pH 8.5), and the fluorescence of ThT was measured using a fluorescence spectrophotometer, F-4500 (Hitachi), at 25 °C with excitation at 445 nm and emission at 485 nm. The amyloid extension reactions of mutant β2-m were carried out in a similar manner.Precipitation Assay for Amyloid Fibrils—After a 4-day incubation with seeds at 37 °C the solutions were centrifuged (15,000 × g, 4 °C, 2 h) to precipitate amyloid fibrils. The concentration of proteins in supernatant was determined by UV absorption, and the precipitated fraction was calculated by subtracting this value from the initial concentration of monomeric proteins.Electron Microscopy—Aliquots (5 μl) of each amyloid extension reaction were diluted with distilled water (95 μl), which was kept at room temperature. These diluted samples were spread on carbon-coated grids, and the solution was allowed to stand for 2-3 min. The excess solution was then removed with filter paper, and the residual solution was allowed to air dry before the grids were negatively stained with 1% phosphotungstic acid (pH 7.0). These samples were examined under an H-7000 electron microscope (Hitachi) with an acceleration voltage of 75 kV.Circular Dichroism—Circular dichroism (CD) measurements were performed with a J-720 spectropolarimeter (Jasco, Tokyo, Japan). The standard buffers for spectroscopic measurements were 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 10 mm glycine-HCl (pH 2.5). For far-UV measurement of the amyloid fibrils, 50 mm citrate-NaOH buffer (pH 2.5) containing 100 mm NaCl at an amyloid fibril concentration of 8.5 μm was used. Amyloid fibrils were prepared by the following method. After 4 days of incubation with seeds at 37 °C, protein solutions were centrifuged (15,000 × g, 4 °C, 2 h) to precipitate amyloid fibrils. The protein concentration in the supernatant was measured by UV absorption to estimate the amount of fibrils precipitated. Precipitated fibrils were then resuspended in 50 mm citrate-NaOH buffer (pH 2.5) containing 100 mm NaCl, which was used as a stock amyloid fibril solution. The amyloid fibrils for the unfolding experiments were prepared using the same method as above.Equilibrium Denaturation by Guanidine Hydrochloride—Gdn-HCl-dependent unfolding of wild-type β2-m and Pro mutants in the monomeric and amyloid fibril states were measured using the change in the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence associated with conformational change. Buffers used for the amyloid fibril and native states were 50 mm citrate-NaOH (pH 2.5) with 100 mm NaCl and 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), respectively. Before the measurements, 25-30 samples containing various concentrations of Gdn-HCl were equilibrated at 25 °C for 24 h. Fluorescence spectra were measured with a fluorescence spectrophotometer, F-4500 (Hitachi), at 25 °C with excitation at 295 nm monitored in the range of 300-450 nm at a protein concentration of 0.05 mg·ml-1.When the transition curves were constructed by plotting the tryptophan fluorescence intensity at a particular wavelength (e.g. 350 nm) against the concentration of Gdn-HCl, scattering of the data points was observed, particularly for amyloid fibrils. This scattering, which was probably caused by the fluctuation of protein concentration, demonstrates the difficulty of dealing with aggregation-prone amyloid fibrils. Usually in these cases shift of the maximum emission wavelength or a ratio of intensities at two different emission wavelengths has been used to obtain a smooth transition curve. However, transition curves produced by either of these two methods do not represent the fraction of each structural state. In other words, the midpoint of the transition represented by these two methods does not agree with the true midpoint of the unfolding transition. Instead, a mathematically exact transition curve can be obtained by performing deconvolution of the spectra. Emission spectra were represented by a combination of the spectra of the amyloid (or native) and unfolded states, so that fractions of the two states were obtained at respective concentrations of Gdn-HCl. We used the spectrum acquired without denaturant as the reference amyloid fibril or native state. The spectrum in the presence of 6 m Gdn-HCl was used as a reference spectrum for the unfolded state for each mutant. To obtain the fraction of unfolded species (fU), the fluorescence spectra from 310 to 450 nm were fitted to the equation F = α(fUF6 M + (1 - fU)F0 M), where F is the spectrum for a sample with each concentration of Gdn-HCl, F0 M and F6 M, for 0 m and 6 m Gdn-HCl, respectively, fU is the fractional population of unfolded species, and α is a variable term for fluorescence intensity. fU was plotted against Gdn-HCl concentration. In the analysis of the unfolding transition of the native state at pH 8, a standard linear relation was assumed between free energy of unfolding (ΔGU) and denaturant concentration ([Gdn-HCl]); ΔGU = ΔGU,H20 - m[Gdn-HCl], where ΔGU,H20 is a free energy of unfolding in water and m is the dependence of ΔGU on Gdn-HCl concentration.RESULTSAmyloid Fibril Formation Monitored by ThT Fluorescence—To analyze the effects of Pro mutations on the amyloidogenic potential, the seed-dependent amyloid fibril extensions of wild-type and mutant β2-ms were examined with wild-type seeds. When monitored by ThT fluorescence, the extension reactions of wild-type β2-m at pH 2.5, completed in 2 h, were consistent with previous reports (19Naiki H. Hashimoto N. Suzuki S. Kimura H.

The kinetics of fibril extension was affected to varying degrees by the mutations, and significant retardation of the extension reaction was observed for several mutants (i.e. L23P, L39P, H51P, L65P, and V82P). Comparison of all the mutants and wild-type β2-ms is summarized in Figs. 2B and 3A. In addition, after 4 days of incubation, all samples were centrifuged at 15,000 × g, and the amounts of precipitated fibrils were estimated (Figs. 2C and 3B). With the exception of L65P, the data from the two different assays were qualitatively consistent (compare Figs. 2B and 2C or Figs. 3, A and B).Fig. 2Formation of amyloid fibrils detected by ThT fluorescence (A and B) and the quantification of precipitated proteins after 4 days of incubation (C).

After 4 days of incubation, L23P and V82P showed less than 30% of the ThT fluorescence and precipitated fractions in comparison with those of wild-type β2-m, indicating decreased tendencies toward amyloid fibril formation. These two mutations were introduced into the β B and F strands, which are connected by the intrachain S-S bond (Fig. 1). Among the mutants with a substitution in the β D strand, H51P also exhibited about 40% of amyloid fibril formation at 4 days compared with wild type. However, we did not observe the marked decreases in ThT fluorescence and precipitated fraction for V49P and L54P, which are also in the β D strand. The intensity of ThT fluorescence for V49P was about twice that of wild-type β2-m. This could be explained by the increased sensitivity of ThT to the fibrils of V49P mutant (see below).For V9P and V93P, ThT fluorescence and the amount of precipitated proteins were almost identical to those of the wild-type protein, indicating little effect of these mutations on fibril formation. Although L65P showed very little ThT fluorescence, more than 90% of protein was precipitated by the centrifugatio"
https://openalex.org/W2063496130,"CXCR4 is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that has multiple critical functions in normal and pathologic physiology that include regulation of the metastatic behavior of mammary carcinoma, and utilization as a coreceptor for infection by T-tropic strains of human immunodeficiency virus-1. Molecular dynamic simulations of the rhodopsin-based homology model of CXCR4 were performed in a solvated lipid bilayer to reproduce the microenvironment of this integral membrane protein. The amino acids in CXCR4 necessary for interaction with an inverse agonist, T140, and a weak partial agonist, AMD3100, identified by alanine scanning mutants, were spatially consistent when computationally docked. Whereas T140 binds residues in extracellular domains and regions of the hydrophobic core proximal to the cell surface, amino acids in the central hydrophobic core are critical to binding of AMD3100. The physical localization of T140 binding to CXCR4 by biochemical analyses corroborated the molecular and computational approaches. The structural basis for the interaction of T140 and AMD3100 with CXCR4 confirms that the mechanisms used by these agents are different. This complementary utilization of molecular, physical, and computation analysis provides a powerful approach to elucidate GPCR conformation."
https://openalex.org/W2117991682,"The presence of elevated circulating triacylglycerol (TG)-rich very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB-100) levels represents an independent risk factor for coronary artery disease. Triacylglycerol hydrolase catalyzes the mobilization of cytoplasmic TG stores. To test the hypothesis that the enzyme plays a role in the provision of core lipids for the assembly of VLDL, we inhibited the lipase activity in primary rat hepatocytes and analyzed lipid and apoB synthesis and secretion. Inhibition of lipolysis resulted in a dramatic decrease in secretion of TGs. In addition, secretion of cholesteryl ester and phosphatidylcholine was substantially decreased. Analysis of secreted apolipoproteins indicated that apoB-100 secretion was much more sensitive to lipase inhibition than was apoB-48 secretion, perhaps because of the ability of apoB-48 to be secreted as a relatively lipid-poor particle. The results agreed with those obtained with hepatoma cells transfected with triacylglycerol hydrolase cDNA, in which preferential lipidation of apoB-100 was observed. Together, our findings provide evidence that inhibition of intracellular TG hydrolysis significantly decreases apoB-100 secretion and suggest that triacylglycerol hydrolase may be a suitable pharmacological target in efforts to lower plasma lipid levels."
https://openalex.org/W2144985457,"Gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) is an endogenous neuromodulator with therapeutical applications in anesthesia, sleep disorders, and drug addiction. We report the cloning of a GHB receptor from a rat hippocampal cDNA library. This receptor has a molecular mass of 56 kDa and belongs to the seven-transmembrane receptor family. The peptidic sequence has no significant homology with any known receptor, including GABA(B) receptors. Its mRNA is restricted to the brain and is particularly abundant in the hippocampus, cortex, striatum, thalamus, olfactory bulbs, and cerebellum, matching the distribution of GHB binding sites in rat brain. Southern blot revealed the presence of homologous sequences in several species including the human. Binding assays on transfected CHO cells showed a dissociation constant (Kd) of 426 nM for GHB and no affinity for GABA, baclofen, or glutamate. In patch-clamp experiments, transfected CHO cells revealed a functional G-protein-coupled receptor as demonstrated by GTP-gamma-S-induced irreversible activation. Application of 0.1-15 microM GHB specifically induced an inward current at negative membrane potentials that was not reproduced by application of baclofen (10 microM).

Here, it is argued that a condition of raised interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) that can be observed in many tumors is a major factor in preventing optimal access of systemically administered chemotherapeutic agents. Using prostaglandin E1-methyl ester (PGE1), which is known transiently to reduce IFP, it was shown that 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) caused significant growth inhibition on two experimental tumors in rats but only after administration of PGE1. Furthermore, timing experiments showed that only in the period in which IFP is reduced did 5-FU have an antitumor effect. These experiments uniquely demonstrate a clear and, according to the starting hypothesis, logical, synergistic effect of PGE1 and 5-FU that offers hope for better treatment of many tumors in which raised IFP is likely to be inhibiting optimal results with water-soluble cancer chemotherapeutic agents."
https://openalex.org/W2167843578,"We have recently shown that injection of the hypothalamic peptide cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript (CART) into discrete hypothalamic nuclei stimulates food intake. This stimulation was particularly marked in the arcuate nucleus. Here we show that twice daily intra-arcuate injection of 0.2 nmole CART peptide for 7 days was associated with a 60% higher daytime food intake, an 85% higher thermogenic response to the beta3 agonist BRL 35135, and a 60% increase in brown adipose tissue UCP-1 mRNA. In a separate study, using stereotactically targeted gene transfer, a CART transgene was delivered by using polyethylenimine to the arcuate nucleus of adult rats. Food intake was increased significantly during ad libitum feeding and following periods of food withdrawal and food restriction in CART over-expressing animals. CART over-expressing animals lost 12% more weight than controls following a 24-h fast. Brown adipose tissue uncoupling protein-1 (UCP-1) mRNA levels (collected Day 25) were 80% higher in CART over-expressing animals. Finally, by using quantitative in situ hybridization, we found that chronic cold exposure (20 days at 4oC) increased arcuate nucleus CART mRNA by 124%. Together with the orexigenic and thermogenic effects of CART, this finding suggests a role for arcuate nucleus CART in cold adaptation."
https://openalex.org/W2138713764,"Allergy diagnosis relying on the determination of specific IgE is frequently complicated by the presence of cross-reacting IgE of unclear clinical relevance. Particularly, the anaphylactogenic activity of IgE directed to cross-reactive carbohydrate moieties of glycoproteins from plants and invertebrates has been a matter of debate. In this study, we present the biochemical and immunological characterization of Api g 5, a glycoprotein allergen from celery with homology to FAD containing oxidases. Carbohydrate analysis of the allergen revealed the presence of glycans carrying fucosyl and xylosyl residues, structures previously shown to bind IgE. Chemical deglycosylation of the protein completely abolished binding of serum IgE from all 14 patients tested. Likewise, basophils from a patient allergic to mugwort pollen and celery were stimulated only by native Api g 5, whereas the deglycosylated allergen did not trigger release of histamine. IgE inhibition immunoblots showed that native Api g 5 other than the deglycosylated protein completely inhibited IgE binding to high molecular weight allergens in protein extracts from birch pollen, mugwort pollen, and celery. A similar inhibition was accomplished using the IgE binding oligosaccharide, MUXF, coupled to bovine serum albumin. All these observations taken together confer convincing evidence that IgE directed to cross-reactive carbohydrates is capable of eliciting allergic reactions in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1979117383,"An extensive analysis has been carried out of mitochondrial biochemical and bioenergetic properties of fibroblasts, mostly skin-derived, from a large group of subjects ranging in age between 20 wk fetal and 103 yr. A striking age-related change observed in a fundamental process underlying mitochondrial biogenesis and function was the very significant decrease in rate of mitochondrial protein synthesis in individuals above 40 yr. The analysis of endogenous respiration rate revealed a significant decrease in the age range from 40 to 90 yr and a tendency to uncoupling in the samples from subjects above 60 yr. A surprising finding was the occurrence of a subgroup of individuals >or=90 yr old whose skin fibroblasts exhibited an exceptionally high respiration rate. This high rate was not due to respiration uncoupling, rather pointing to a compensatory phenomenon, not involving an increase in mtDNA content, in the corresponding skin fibroblast populations, or, possibly, to a selection of a different cell type secondary to more extensive dermal atrophy. The most important aging-related phenotypic effects observed were those that affected the cell oxidative phosphorylation (OX-PHOS) capacity. These were, in particular, the very significant reduction in the ratio of uncoupled to oligomycin-inhibited endogenous respiration observed in intact fibroblasts, which pointed to a decrease with donor's age in the control of respiration by the mitochondrial membrane potential, the very significant decrease in efficiency of OX-PHOS, as determined by novel in situ measurements of P:O ratios, and, consistent with these results, the very significant reduction in the respiratory control ratios. These findings clearly pointed to a dramatic mitochondrial dysfunction, which would lead to a decrease in ATP synthesis rate, with the observed decline in mitochondrial protein synthesis rate being a likely contributing factor. These observations have important implications for understanding the biology of aging, as well as the pathogenesis of aging-related degenerative diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2062748949,"Nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF-1) is a transcriptional activator of nuclear genes that encode a range of mitochondrial proteins including cytochrome c, various other respiratory chain subunits, and delta-aminolevulinate synthase. Activation of NRF-1 in fibroblasts has been shown to induce increases in cytochrome c expression and mitochondrial respiratory capacity. To further evaluate the role of NRF-1 in the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and respiratory capacity, we generated transgenic mice overexpressing NRF-1 in skeletal muscle. Cytochrome c expression was increased approximately twofold and delta-aminolevulinate synthase was increased approximately 50% in NRF-1 transgenic muscle. The levels of some mitochondrial proteins were increased 50-60%, while others were unchanged. Muscle respiratory capacity was not increased in the NRF-1 transgenic mice. A finding that provides new insight regarding the role of NRF-1 was that expression of MEF2A and GLUT4 was increased in NRF-1 transgenic muscle. The increase in GLUT4 was associated with a proportional increase in insulin-stimulated glucose transport. These results show that an isolated increase in NRF-1 is not sufficient to bring about a coordinated increase in expression of all of the proteins necessary for assembly of functional mitochondria. They also provide the new information that NRF-1 overexpression results in increased expression of GLUT4."
https://openalex.org/W2163379732,"In neurons, hypoxia activates intracellular death-related pathways, yet the antiapoptotic mechanisms triggered by hypoxia remain unclear. In RN46A neuronal cells, minimum media growth conditions induced cell death as early as 12 h after the cells were placed in these conditions (i.e., after removal of B-27 supplement). However, apoptosis occurred in hypoxia (1% O2) only after 48 h, and in fact hypoxia reduced the apoptosis associated with trophic factor withdrawal. Furthermore, hypoxia induced time-dependent increases in expression of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) B mRNA and protein, as well as PDGF-beta receptor phosphorylation. Although exogenous PDGF-BB induced only transient Akt activation, hypoxia triggered persistent activation of Akt for up to 24 h. Inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) or of PDGF-beta receptor phosphorylation abrogated both hypoxia-induced and exogenous PDGF-BB-induced Akt phosphorylation, and it completely abolished hypoxia-induced protection from media supplement deprivation, which suggests that the long-lasting activation of Akt during hypoxia and the prosurvival induction were due to endogenously generated PDGF-BB. Furthermore, these inhibitors decreased hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha) DNA binding, which suggests that the PDGF/PDGF-beta receptor/Akt pathway induces downstream HIF-1alpha gene transcription. We conclude that in RN46A neuronal cells, hypoxia activates an autocrine-paracrine antiapoptotic mechanism that involves up-regulation of PDGF-B and PDGF-beta receptor-dependent activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway to induce downstream transcription of survival genes."
https://openalex.org/W2146994866,"The goal of this study is to investigate whether TLR2 mediates hBD2 induction through NF-kappaB in response to bacterial components in the human airway epithelia. We showed that hTLR2 is expressed in the airway epithelial cells by immunohistochemical staining and RT-PCR. The biology of hTLR2 in this context was studied initially in 293 cells transfected with a plasmid expressing hTLR2 together with an hBD2 promoter-driven luciferase reporter (hBD2-promoter-LUC). Upon incubation with lipoteichoic acid (LTA), the major cell wall component of gram-positive bacteria, luciferase activity was greatly increased compared with mock stimulation. Analysis of mutation constructs of the hBD2 promoter revealed that NF-kappaB sites are important for hTLR2-mediated hBD2 up-regulation upon LTA stimulation. When hBD2-promoter-LUC was transfected into primary human airway epithelia cells (EC), the luciferase activity was greatly increased upon LTA stimulation compared with mock stimulation. The hBD2 promoter mutation constructs were also tested in EC, which confirmed the studies in 293 cells. When a plasmid expressing a dominant-negative mutant of hTLR2 was co-transfected with hBD2-promoter-LUC into EC, LTA could not stimulate hBD2 expression. These data provide convincing evidence that up-regulation of hBD2 can be induced through hTLR2-mediated NFkappaB/IkappaB pathway in the human airway epithelial cells."

Excessive or inappropriate growth factor signaling by receptor tyrosine kinases has been implicated in the progression of several cancers and disorders of developmental processes. Thus, the strength and the duration of this signaling must be controlled strictly in normal biological processes. A negative feedback loop is one of the mechanisms that provides an effective way to terminate, limit, or modulate receptor tyrosine kinase signaling (8.Freeman M.

Recently, many novel negative regulators of growth factor signaling were described using genetic screening methods. Sprouty was identified in Drosophila melanogaster as an inhibitor of FGF signaling during tracheal development (13.Hacohen N. Kramer S. Sutherland D. Hiromi Y. Krasnow M.A. Cell. 1998; 92: 253-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). However, how this gene functions remains unknown. During D. melanogaster eye development, Sprouty seems to inhibit the activation of MAPK upstream of Ras (14.Casci T. Vinos J. Freeman M. Cell. 1999; 96: 655-665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). In contrast, during wing development, Sprouty was reported to inhibit MAPK downstream of Ras (15.Reich A. Sapir A. Shilo B. Development. 1999; 126: 4139-4147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). D. melanogaster has only one Sprouty protein, whereas mammals have at least four isoforms (16.de Maximy A.A.

Sef (similar expression of FGF genes) is another novel negative regulator of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling that was first isolated from a zebrafish embryo library through in situ hybridization (20.Furthauer M. Lin W. Ang S.L. Thisse B. Thisse C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 170-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 21.Tsang M. Friesel R. Kudoh T. Dawid I.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Sef was reported to be syn-expressed with FGF8, FGF3, Sprouty2, and Sprouty4 in zebrafish and in mouse. Extensive similarities between the expression patterns of these genes indicate that they could be coregulated. In zebrafish, Sef functions as a novel negative regulator of Ras-MAPK-mediated FGF signaling (20.Furthauer M. Lin W. Ang S.L. Thisse B. Thisse C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 170-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 21.Tsang M. Friesel R. Kudoh T. Dawid I.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Most recent reports indicated that overexpression of mSef in vitro could inhibit FGF-induced 3T3 cell proliferation associated with a reduction of FGFR1 phosphorylation (22.Kovalenko D. Yang X. Nadeau R.J. Harkins L.K. Friesel R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14087-14091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Those results suggest that Sef could be involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, or other cell fates mediated by FGF signaling. However, the physiological function of mammalian Sef remains unknown. Accordingly, the detailed molecular mechanism that Sef regulates FGF signaling in mammalian cells needed to be clarified. In this study, we searched GenBank using a conserved domain of the IL-17AR and identified a gene with 31% amino acid identity to IL-17 receptor (23.Yao Z. Spriggs M.K. Derry J.M. Strockbine L.

Immunol. 1997; 17: 366-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We then used RACE to isolate full-length cDNAs and identified two isoforms. The long isoform of the sequence was identical to the recently reported mouse and human Sef genes (22.Kovalenko D. Yang X. Nadeau R.J. Harkins L.K. Friesel R. J. Biol.

We have named the short isoform Sef-S in this article. More importantly, using PC-12 cell lines as a model, we demonstrate that overexpression of hSef significantly inhibited FGF2- or NGF-induced PC-12 cell differentiation. hSef, as a negative regulator of FGF signaling pathway, exerted an inhibitory effect on PC-12 cell differentiation, possibly through prevention of FGFR-Ras-MAPK signaling on molecules upstream of Ras. GenBank Data Base Search and RACE PCR—The human high-throughput genomic sequence (HTGS) data base was scanned for “virtual” open reading frames using the ab initio gene prediction program GENSCAN (27.Burge C. Karlin S. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 78-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (3098) Google Scholar). Signal sequences were predicted by SIGNALP algorithm (28.Nielsen H. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1999; 12: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). Predication of the transmembrane domain was performed with TMPRED (29.Landolt-Marticorena C. Williams K.A. Deber C.M. Reithmeier R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 602-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), an algorithm based on the statistical analysis of a transmembrane domain data base. Netphos2.0 was used to identify and score all possible cytoplasmic serine, threonine, and tyrosine phosphorylation sites. To obtain a full-length cDNA, 5′-RACE PCR was performed using mRNA from normal human testis and 293T cells according to the SMART RACE cDNA amplification kit user manual (Clontech). Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol reagent kit (Invitrogen) and reverse-transcribed using an oligo(dT) primer and Superscript II kit (Invitrogen). The 5′-RACE PCR products were then cloned into pT-Adv vector according to the AdvanTage PCR cloning kit instructions and then sequenced. Plasmid Construction—Full-length cDNA of hSef was cloned into pcDNA3.0 and pcDNA3.1/Myc-His by HindIII/XhoI sites. hSef-S and mSef-S were subcloned into the EcoRI/XhoI sites of pcDNA3.0 with a six-repeat Myc tag at the N terminus. The deletions and mutants of hSef were cloned into pIRESneo expression vector by standard polymerase chain reaction. Mouse FGFR-1, -2, -3, and -4 constructs were donated by Dr. D. Onitz. Elk-1 luciferase reporter plasmids and Sprouty4 were the gift from Dr. A. Yoshimura. The constitutive active MEK was donated by Dr. M. Cobb and active RasG12V construct was provided by Dr. T. Satoh. Cell Lines—293T cells and COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum/glutamine/penicillin/streptomycin. Rat pheochromocytoma PC-12 cells (ATCC) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 5% horse serum (Invitrogen). Antibody Preparation—For bacterial production of hSef, an open reading frame coding for the peptide in intracellular domain of hSef (M320–I457, 138 aa) was amplified by PCR and cloned into pGEX4T-1 vector. The reading frame was sequence-confirmed after cloning. hSef was expressed in the inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli, solubilized with 4 m guanidine HCL, and dialyzed against 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5, containing 0.1 m NaCl. Antisera were raised in rabbits by standard methods and used for immunoblot analysis after 1,000–10,000-fold dilution. Immunofluorescent Staining and Microscopy—COS-7 cells were cultured on 6-well plates with 8 × 104 per well (Corning Incorporated, Corning, NY). Cells were cotransfected with mFGFR2 and hSef constructs using Effectine transfection reagent (Qiagen). hSef and mFGFR2 were stained with secondary antibodies conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (green) and Cy3 (red), respectively. The cells were viewed using a Nikon inverted microscope ECLIPSE TE300. The co-localization of the two proteins was shown as a merged figure. Generation of Stably Transfected PC-12 Cell Clones—To establish hSef stably expressed PC-12 cell lines, PC-12 cells were transfected with the above constructs using Transfast transfection reagent (Promega). Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were plated at several different dilutions in media containing 0.5 mg/ml G418. For the next 2 weeks, the selective media were replaced every 3 to 4 days. Once the distinct “islands” of surviving cells were visualized, the individual clones were transferred into 96-well plates and continued to maintain cultures in selected media. The positive clones were confirmed by immunoblotting. Western Blotting and Immunoprecipitation—The cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate in the presence of protease inhibitors. The immune complexes were captured with protein A or G-Sepharose, washed in lysis buffer, and resolved by SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane, and the membrane was blocked with 5% non-fat milk in TBST containing 0.1% Tween 20 overnight at 4 °C. Then, the indicated primary antibody was incubated, followed by horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-sheep or anti mouse antibodies as secondary antibodies and detected by chemiluminescence according to manufacturer's instructions (ECL; Amersham Biosciences). Luciferase Assay—The Elk-1 luciferase activity assay was performed using trans-reporting constructs, including PFA-Elk-1 and PFR-luciferase plasmids (PathDetect in vivo signal transduction pathway trans-reporting system; Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The Elk-1 luciferase activity was measured using a luciferase assay system (Promega). The results were expressed as mean ± S.D. from three independent experiments. Differentiation of PC-12 Cells—PC-12 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 5% horse serum, and 4.5 g/liter glucose at 37 °C under 5% CO2. The cells were plated at a subconfluent density on 12-well culture plates coated with poly-l-lysine to improve cell attachment activity. The next day, cells were transiently transfected with enhanced green fluorescent protein, wild-type hSef, or the mutants for 36 h using Effectene Transfection reagent (Qiagen). Cells were stimulated with or without recombinant human FGF2 or NGF (R&D Systems) for 72 h and then examined by fluorescence microscopy. Cells with processes longer than 1.5 times the diameter of the cell body were considered to be positive for neurite outgrowth. The numbers of undifferentiated and differentiated cells were counted in three randomly selected fields containing ∼200 cells each. Data were expressed as means ± S.D of three independent counts. Cloning and Primary Structure of hSef—To explore for the existence of additional members of the IL-17 receptor gene family, we screened the National Center for Biotechnology Information expressed sequence tag and NR databases using the cytoplasmic domain of the IL-17 receptor with the tBlastn and Blastp algorithms. We found several expressed sequence tags encoding an unknown protein reported in Gene Bank as the hypothetical human protein DKFZp434N1928 (accession no. AL133097). However, the translated sequence was only a fragment without an N terminus. We performed 5′-RACE PCR using mRNA from human testis tissue and 293T cells and obtained two complete cDNAs that were 4477 and 4478 bp long. The 4477-bp cDNA predicted an open reading frame of 739 amino acids encoding a novel single transmembrane protein (Fig. 1A), whereas the other cDNA encoded a protein of 595 amino acids that lacked the N-terminal 144 amino acids of the longer protein (Fig. 1B). BLAST analysis revealed that the sequences were identical to the Sef gene of human and mouse (20.Furthauer M. Lin W. Ang S.L. Thisse B. Thisse C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 170-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 21.Tsang M. Friesel R. Kudoh T. Dawid I.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). However, only the longer protein isoform had previously been reported. We had isolated two isoforms of the gene in both human and mouse (GenBank accession numbers AF494208 & AF494211 and AF494210 & AF494209, respectively), and we adopt the name Sef for the long form and Sef-S for the short form in this article. hSef was mapped on human chromosome 3p21.1 with 13 exons and spanned 70,903 base pairs. hSef-S consisted of 14 exons and spanned 85,485 base pairs (Fig. 1C). mSef or mSef-S was located on chromosome 14 with 13 or 12 exons, respectively. and spanned 6,6304 and 13,726 base pairs, respectively. mSef and mSef-S encoded proteins with 738 and 594 amino acids, respectively. hSef is 75% identitical to mSef at the amino acid level, whereas hSef-S and mSerf-S shared 72% identity.Fig. 1Sequence information of Sef.A, nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence of interleukin-17 receptor-like molecule (hSef). Nested RACE-PCR was used to clone the 5′-fragment of the Sef cDNA, and then the full-length cDNA was assembled by reverse transcriptase-PCR.

B, sequence alignment of Sef alternative splicing forms. Both splicing forms of hSef were aligned using ClustalW multiple alignment. hSef-S is shown as a truncated form, which lacks 144 amino acids at the N terminus compared with hSef. C, genomic structure of human Sef. Schematic representation of exons is marked, and spans nucleotides 427,937–498,840 (hSef) and 420,648–506,133 (hSef-S) in NT_005787.8 from human chromosome 3p21. The hSef (long form) has 13 exons and hSef-S (short form) has 14 exons. The start and stop codons are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Computer-assisted analysis suggested that hSef contained a putative signal peptide of 16 amino acids, a 281-amino acid extracellular domain (Cys17-Pro297), a 23-amino acid transmembrane stretch (Ile298-Met320), and a 420-amino acid cytoplasmic tail (Cys321-Leu739). This protein was predicted to be a type I single span transmembrane molecule according to Hartmann membrane topology model and PSORT II server. There were eight cystine residues and nine potential N-linked glycosylation sites in the extracellular domain, where an immunoglobulin domain and a fibronectin III domain were also predicted. Furthermore, a highly conserved segment (TPPPLRPRKVW) located proximal to the IL-17 receptor transmembrane domain was replaced by the proline-rich segment (PFHPPPLRYREP), a putative SH3 interaction domain, which is a typical feature of transactivation domains for transcription factors. In addition, a putative TIR domain (Val358-Lys424) (Toll/IL-1 Receptor domain) (30.O'Neill L. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2000; 28: 557-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) and a putative TRAF6 binding motif (Pro347-Leu351), Pro-X-Glu-X-X (aromatic/acidic residue) (31.Ye H. Arron J.R. Lamothe B. Cirilli M. Kobayashi T. Shevde N.K. Segal D. Dzivenu O.K. Vologodskaia M. Yim M. Du K. Singh S. Pike J.W. Darnay B.G. Choi Y. Wu H. Nature. 2002; 418: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar), were predicted in the intracellular part of hSef. Sef Interacted with FGFR—It has been reported that FGFRs were highly expressed in kidney tissue (32.Cancilla B. Davies A. Cauchi J.A. Risbridger G.P. Bertram J.F. Kidney Int. 2001; 60: 147-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), where hSef was also abundant (data not shown). Based on the suggestion that zSef and mSef might interact with FGFRs (22.Kovalenko D. Yang X. Nadeau R.J. Harkins L.K. Friesel R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14087-14091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), we reasoned that hSef could interact with FGFRs and possibly affect FGF signaling. To detect whether a physical interaction of the two receptors occurred, we carried out a co-immunoprecipitation assay by co-expression of the two proteins in COS-7 cells. We successfully precipitated the FGFR1 (Fig. 2A) and FGFR2 (Fig. 2B) using anti-Sef serum, but failed to precipitate FGFR3 (data not shown), suggesting that Sef specifically interacted with FGFR1 and FGFR2 in intact cells. These results are consistent with the report of interactions between zebrafish Sef with Xenopus laevis FGFR1 or FGFR2 (21.Tsang M. Friesel R. Kudoh T. Dawid I.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). It also implied that hSef might elicit an effect on FGFR signaling similar to that of Spred or Sprouty family members, which strongly inhibit FGFR signaling (13.Hacohen N. Kramer S. Sutherland D. Hiromi Y. Krasnow M.A. Cell. 1998; 92: 253-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar, 14.Casci T. Vinos J. Freeman M.

Yoshimura A. Nature. 2001; 412: 647-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 34.Yusoff P. Lao D.H. Ong S.H. Wong E.S. Lim J. Lo T.L. Leong H.F. Fong C.W. Guy G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3195-3201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). To further examine whether co-expression of the two receptors occurred in mammalian cells, we carried out the immunostaining assay with the anti-FGFR2 antibody and anti-hSef serum. The results demonstrated that overexpressed hSef and FGFR2 were co-localized in COS-7 cells (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, we found that hSef was co-localized with FGFR1 in normal human testis (Fig. 5D), whereas we failed to observe obvious co-expression of the two proteins in other tissues (data not shown). Taken together, these data suggested that hSef interacted with FGFR1 and FGFR2 under at least some physiological condition. hSef Strongly Inhibited FGF2 or NGF-induced PC-12 Cell Differentiation—Although hSef is able to interact with FGFR1 and FGFR2, the biological function of this protein in mammalian cells remains unclear. Next, we examined whether hSef could affect FGF signaling. We stably expressed hSef in PC-12 cells, a rat pheochromocytoma cell line that could be induced into sympathetic neuron-like cells possessing elongated neuritis by basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2) or NGF. As showed in Fig. 3A, mock-transfected PC-12 clones were induced into neurite outgrowth in the presence of FGF-2 or NGF as seen in normal PC-12 cells. In contrast, all clones transfected with hSef, remained undifferentiated in response to either FGF2 or NGF, suggesting that hSef elicited an inhibitory effect on the differentiation of PC-12 cells (Fig. 3A). The percentages of cells with neurite outgrowth (differentiated cells) were significantly decreased for cells stably expressing hSef at both dosages of FGF2 or NGF (Fig. 3B). When cells were exposed to FGF2 or NGF for longer periods, the percentage of mock-transfected clones that were induced into neurite outgrowth increased significantly, whereas clones transfected with hSef resisted differentiation in the presence of FGF2 (Fig. 3C) or NGF (Fig. 3D). These results indicate that hSef could significantly inhibit the differentiation of PC-12 cells triggered by FGF2 or NGF, even in conditions of higher dosage or prolonged exposure of growth factor. To determine which domain of hSef was necessary for inhibition of PC-12 cell differentiation induced by FGF2, we constructed the N-terminal truncated mutant hSef(Δ N), which lacks the N-terminal extracellular domain of hSef; the C-terminal truncated mutant hSef(Δ C), which lacks C-terminal intracellular domain of hSef; and a mutant hSef(DN), which lacks a motif (Glu327∼Leu333) in the intracellular domain containing a putative tyrosine phosphorylation site. We overexpressed these mutants with enhanced green fluorescent protein in PC-12 cells in the presence or absence of FGF2. In control cells and overexpressing hSef(Δ C) cells, FGF2 strongly induced cell differentiation. However, in the cells overexpressing hSef(WT), hSef(Δ N), and hSef(DN), FGF2 failed to induce significant cell differentiation (Fig. 3, E and F), suggesting that the N-terminal-truncated mutant and the (Δ Glu327-Leu333) mutant missing the seven amino acid putative tyrosine phosphorylation site did not affect the inhibitory properties of Sef on FGF2-induced PC-12 cell differentiation. These data indicated that the intracellular domain plays a critical role in the inhibition of PC-12 cell differentiation induced by FGF2. The results also suggest that hSef(DN), which lacks a tyrosine phosphorylation motif (Glu327∼Leu333) in the intracellular domain of hSef, does not function as a dominant negative form. hSef Inhibited Ras-MAPK Signaling Pathway—It has been reported that Ras-MAPK signaling was required for FGF2-induced PC-12 cell differentiation. To investigate the role of hSef in MAPK activation during FGF2-induced PC-12 cell differentiation, we first determined the effects of Sef on Elk-1 mediated luciferase activity. Data showed that overexpression of hSef significantly suppressed FGF2-induced Elk-1 luciferase activity in PC-12 cells (Fig. 4A), which was comparable with the effect of Sprouty4 (14.Casci T. Vinos J. Freeman M. Cell. 1999; 96: 655-665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 33.Wakioka T. Sasaki A. Kato R. Shouda T. Matsumoto A. Miyoshi K. Tsuneoka M. Komiya S. Baron R. Yoshimura A. Nature. 2001; 412: 647-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 34.Yusoff P. Lao D.H. Ong S.H. Wong E.S. Lim J. Lo T.L. Leong H.F. Fong C.W. Guy G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3195-3201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Compared with Sef, the C-terminal truncated mutant hSef(Δ C) and the N-terminal truncated mutant hSef(Δ N) had about 23 and 81% of the inhibitory effect, respectively (Fig. 4A, columns 4 and 5). This result was also correlated with the inhibitory effect of hSef on the FGF2-induced PC-12 cell differentiation. Furthermore, our results showed both hSef(WT) and hSef(Δ N) suppressed FGF2-dependent Elk-1 luciferase activity in PC-12 cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4, B and C). Earlier studies had shown that activation of ERK1/2 was important for neurite outgrowth in PC-12 cells and that ERK1/2 phosphorylation was strongly but transiently induced by FGF2, with the level of phosphorylation reaching a maximum within 5–10 min and then declining to lower sustained levels (35.Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4245) Google Scholar, 36.Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar). With this in mind, we examined whether hSef suppressed endogenous ERK1/2 activation induced by FGF2 in PC-12 cells. As shown in Fig. 4D, overexpression of hSef significantly suppressed endogenous ERK phosphorylation, with a maximum inhibition at 10 min after stimulation. In addition, hSef exhibited an inhibitory effect on ERK activation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4E). These results indicate that hSef could inhibit FGF2-induced PC-12 cell differentiation, possibly through the inhibition of Ras-MAPK signaling. hSef Inhibited Ras-MAPK Signaling, Possibly by Targeting the Upstream Molecules of Ras—To attempt to identify the signaling component of Ras-MAPK pathway in FGF2-induced PC-12 differentiation that is suppressed by Sef, we used the constitutively active Ras(G12V) or active MEK(MEK1RF) molecules to examine ERK activation and Elk-1 luciferase activity in both PC-12 cells and 293T cells. Both luciferase assays and Western blotting analysis results showed that hSef had no inhibitory effect on the signaling mediated by constitutively active MEK (Fig. 5, A–C) or Ras (Fig. 5, D–F) in both PC-12 and 293T cells. These data suggest that the target signaling molecule for Sef was located upstream of Ras in the FGFR-Ras-MAPK signaling pathway at least in PC-12 and 293T cells. In our attempt to identify novel receptors in the IL-17 family (37.Shi Y. Ullrich S.J. Zhang J. Connolly K. Grzegorzewski K.J. Barber M.C. Wang W. Wathen K. Hodge V. Fisher C.L. Olsen H. Ruben S.M.

Chem. 2002; 277: 4309-4316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), we screened GenBank using the intracellular domain of human IL-17AR and found a gene encoding novel single-span transmembrane proteins. Our results show that there are at least two isoforms of this gene in mouse and human. The long form of the sequence was identical to Sef (26.Yang R.B. Ng C.K. Wasserman S.M. Komuves L.G. Gerritsen M.E. Topper J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; Google Scholar), and we adopted the name of Sef-S for the short form in this article. The specific functions of this gene were unclear. In this report, we provided evidence that hSef has an inhibitory effect on the PC-12 differentiation induced by FGF2 or NGF. zSef and mSef, zebrafish and mouse orthologues of the Sef gene, have recently been reported to be novel modulators of FGF signaling, and zSef might regulate Ras/MAPK signaling triggered by FGF during early zebrafish embryonic development (20.Furthauer M. Lin W. Ang S.L. Thisse B. Thisse C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 170-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 21.Tsang M. Friesel R. Kudoh T. Dawid I.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Our data demonstrate that hSef interact and colocalize with FGFRs in some human tissues. This interaction was confirmed by immunoprecipitation assays, which showed that hSef interacted with FGFR1 and FGFR2 but not FGFR3. We examined the effect of Sef on growth factor-induced neurite outgrowth of PC-12 pheochromocytoma cells, which is dependent upon the Ras-MAPK signaling pathway. Our results show that hSef significantly suppresses FGF2- or NGF-induced PC-12 cell differentiation even in conditions of higher growth factor dosage or elongated exposure. The cytoplasmic domain of Sef is critical for the inhibition of PC-12 cell differentiation induced by FGF-2. We further investigated the molecular mechanism on the effect of Sef on the inhibition of PC-12 cell differentiation. Our results show that the inhibitory effect of overexpressed hSef on FGF2-induced PC-12 cell differentiation was significantly correlated with the role of hSef on the prevention of Ras-MAPK activation. Interestingly, two reports showed that zSef was expressed in mid-brain–hindbrain boundary, hindbrain, and forebrain (20.Furthauer M. Lin W. Ang S.L. Thisse B. Thisse C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 170-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 21.Tsang M. Friesel R. Kudoh T. Dawid I.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Another group using in situ hybridization demonstrated expression of mSef in the forebrain, mid-brain–hindbrain boundary region and branchial arches in the mouse (25.Lin W. Furthauer M. Thisse B. Thisse C. Jing N. Ang S.L. Mech. Dev. 2002; 113: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Recently, a report demonstrated that hSef was detectable in human brain (26.Yang R.B. Ng C.K. Wasserman S.M. Komuves L.G. Gerritsen M.E. Topper J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; Google Scholar), which is consistent with our Northern blot analysis (data not shown). All of those data suggested that the Sef gene is expressed in the brain. In this article, we adopted PC-12 cells as a model to demonstrate that hSef inhibited cell differentiation induced by FGF or NGF. Therefore, we speculate that Sef might play a role in developmental processes in the nervous system. Opposing results on the point of action of Sef on FGFR-Ras-MAPK signaling have been reported. One group has suggested that Sef acts at the FGFR level (21.Tsang M. Friesel R. Kudoh T. Dawid I.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), whereas another has demonstrated that Sef functions downstream of Ras (20.Furthauer M. Lin W. Ang S.L. Thisse B. Thisse C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 170-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Like Sprouty, the specific target molecule of Sef interfering with Ras-MAPK signaling is unclear. Our results demonstrated that Sef suppressed Ras-MAPK activation, possibly functioning upstream of Ras, possibly at the FGFR. We have succeeded in detecting colocalization of endogenous Sef with FGFR1 in the testis and other tissues (data not shown). Sef might also function through other pathways if it can interact with other indirect signaling molecules in FGF signaling. Thus, the detailed molecular mechanism of the physiological regulation of Sef on FGFR signaling remains to be determined. Taken together, our results show that Sef is an interesting and important molecule that significantly inhibits FGF2-induced PC-12 cell differentiation, probably through prevention of Ras/MAPK signaling. However, the precise functions of Sef in vivo and its splicing isoform remain unclear. The next critical goal is to disrupt the locus in mice for clarifying functions in vivo.

https://openalex.org/W2157041817,"The matrix metalloprotease matrilysin is expressed in premalignant polyps and plays a key role in local invasion during the progression of digestive tumors. In the present work, we investigated the possible relationships between the activity of the mouse and human matrilysin promoters (Mp), endogenous matrilysin protein expression, and two early oncogenetic defects frequently observed in human colonic cancers, namely activation of the src oncogene and impairment of the Wnt/APC/beta-catenin pathway. Using transient transfection assays, we report here that src signaling and the HMG-box transcription factor LEF-1 act synergistically with the proximal (-61 to -67) AP-1 binding site to transactivate the Mp in premalignant and tumorigenic kidney and colonic epithelial cells, through beta-catenin- and axin-independent signaling pathways. This synergism involves the -109 and -194 Tcf/LEF-1 binding sites in the Mp and a physical interaction between LEF-1 and c-Jun. Furthermore, src coordinates accumulation of the c-Jun factor and matrilysin transcripts. Conversely, the c-Jun dominant negative mutant TAM67 and the src tyrosine kinase inhibitor M475271 impaired src-induced Mp activation, matrilysin protein accumulation, and invasion of type I collagen gels. This mechanism may thereby contribute to cellular invasion during the early-stage adenoma/adenocarcinoma conversion and the metastatic process of digestive tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2172137781,"The existence of an increased number of Kupffer cells is recognized as critical in the initiation of the inflammatory cascade leading to liver fibrosis. Because 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) is a key regulator of cell growth and survival, in the current investigation we assessed whether inhibition of the 5-LO pathway would reduce the excessive number of Kupffer cells and attenuate inflammation and fibrosis in experimental liver disease. Kupffer cells were the only liver cell type endowed with a metabolically active 5-LO pathway (i.e., expressed mRNAs for 5-LO, 5-LO-activating protein [FLAP], and leukotriene [LT] C4 synthase and generated LTB4 and cysteinyl-LTs). Both the selective 5-LO inhibitor AA861 and the FLAP inhibitor BAY-X-1005 markedly reduced the number of Kupffer cells in culture. The antiproliferative properties of AA861 and BAY-X-1005 were associated with the occurrence of condensed nuclei, fragmented DNA, and changes in DNA content and cell cycle frequency distribution consistent with an apoptotic process. In vivo, in carbon tetrachloride-treated rats, BAY-X-1005 had a significant antifibrotic effect and reduced liver damage and the hepatic content of hydroxyproline. Together, these findings indicate a novel mechanism by which inactivation of the 5-LO pathway could disrupt the sequence of events leading to liver inflammation and fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2130494787,"Interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), or N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA) are increased in patients with chronic disease-related anemia. They increase the binding activity of GATA and inhibit erythropoietin (Epo) promoter activity. In this study, we examined the ability of K-7174 (a GATA-specific inhibitor) to improve Epo production when inhibited by treatment with IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, or L-NMMA. Epo protein production and promoter activity were induced in Hep3B cells with 1% O2. However, 15 U/ml IL-1beta, 220 U/ml TNF-alpha, or 10(-3) M L-NMMA inhibited Epo protein production and promoter activity, respectively. Addition of 10 microM K-7174 rescued these inhibitions of Epo protein production and promoter activity induced by IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, or L-NMMA, respectively. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that addition of K-7174 decreased GATA binding activity, which was increased with the addition of IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, or L-NMMA. Furthermore, intraperitoneal injection of mice with IL-1beta or TNF-alpha decreased the hemoglobin concentrations and reticulocyte counts. However, the addition of K-7174 reversed these effects. These results raise the possibility of using K-7174 as therapy to treat anemia."
https://openalex.org/W2131533678,"Diabetic (DB) mice exhibit significant resistance to hepatotoxicants. The role of peroxisome proliferator receptor (PPAR)-alpha activation in diabetes, in protection against lethal acetaminophen (APAP) challenge, was investigated. Upon treatment with APAP (600 mg/kg, i.p., a LD100 dose in wild-type [WT] non-DB mice), WT-DB mice showed only 30% mortality and 40% less liver injury as measured by alanine aminotransferase and histopathology. In contrast, diabetes in PPAR knockout (PPAR-alpha-/-) mice failed to protect against APAP toxicity, suggesting the importance of PPAR-alpha in diabetes-induced protection. S-phase DNA synthesis and PCNA immunohistochemical staining after injury showed early and robust tissue repair in WT-DB mice, but not in the PPAR-alpha-/--DB mice. Microarray analyses were performed on livers from non-DB and DB (WT and PPAR-alpha-/-) mice at 0 and 12 h after APAP. Microarray data were confirmed via real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis of several genes, including stress response, immediate early genes, DNA damage, heat shock proteins, and cell cycle regulators, followed by Western analyses of selected proteins. Gel shift assays revealed higher activation of nuclear factor-kappaB in WT-DB mice after APAP treatment. These findings suggest PPAR-alpha activation as a hepatoprotective adaptive response mediating protection against APAP in diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2005448107,"The androgen receptor (AR), a member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily, functions as a ligand-dependent transcription factor that regulates genes involved in cell proliferation and differentiation. Using a C-terminal region of the human AR in a yeast two-hybrid screen, we have identified RACK1 (receptor for activated Ckinase-1) as an AR-interacting protein. In this report we found that RACK1, which was previously shown to be a protein kinase C (PKC)-anchoring protein that determines the localization of activated PKCβII isoform, facilitates ligand-independent AR nuclear translocation upon PKC activation by indolactam V. We also observed RACK1 to suppress ligand-dependent and -independent AR transactivation through PKC activation. In chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we demonstrate a decrease in AR recruitment to the AR-responsive prostate-specific antigen (PSA) promoter following stimulation of PKC. Furthermore, prolonged exposure to indolactam V, a PKC activator, caused a reduction in PSA mRNA expression in prostate cancer LNCaP cells. Finally, we found PKC activation to have a repressive effect on AR and PSA protein expression in androgen-treated LNCaP cells. Our data suggest that RACK1 may function as a scaffold for the association and modification of AR by PKC enabling translocation of AR to the nucleus but rendering AR unable to activate transcription of its target genes.

In its inactive state, unliganded AR is associated with heat-shock proteins from which it dissociates upon binding of the ligand, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which is generated from testosterone by membrane-bound 5-α-reductase. Following homodimerization, AR translocates to the nucleus where it interacts with coactivators or corepressors and binds to androgen response elements (AREs) located in the promoter region of target genes triggering their transcriptional activation or repression (1Gnanapragasam V.J. Robson C.N. Leung H.Y. Neal D.E. BJU Int. 2000; 86: 1001-1013Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Jenster G. Semin. Oncol. 1999; 26: 407-421PubMed Google Scholar). There is evidence to support AR cross-talk with other cellular signal transduction pathways resulting in AR ligand-independent activation and modulation of AR transactivation. There is also mounting evidence that ligand-independent activation of AR may play a role in hormone refractory prostate cancer. cAMP-dependent kinase (PKA) has been reported to mediate ligand-independent AR activation and cross-talk between AR and PKA signaling pathways resulting in androgen-independent induction of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) gene expression (3Nazareth L.V. Weigel N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19900-19907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 4Sadar M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7777-7783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). In contrast, protein kinase C (PKC) negatively regulates AR-dependent transcription (5Darne C. Veyssiere G. Jean C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 256: 541-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). AR activation in the absence of ligand has been reported in response to the peptide hormones epidermal growth factor (EGF), keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), which serve as ligands for receptor-tyrosine kinases and activate downstream intracellular kinase cascades (6Culig Z. Hobisch A. Cronauer M.V. Radmayr C. Trapman J. Hittmair A. Bartsch G. Klocker H. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5474-5478PubMed Google Scholar). These growth factors can activate transcription from an androgen-responsive reporter construct in the absence of ligand or synergistically in conjunction with androgens. Interleukin-6 (IL-6), a multifunctional cytokine, can also stimulate ligand-independent AR activation via mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT-3) signaling pathways in LNCaP human prostate cancer cells (7Ueda T. Mawji N.R. Bruchovsky N. Sadar M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38087-38094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Moreover, steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1) has been shown to enhance ligand-independent activation of the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the AR by IL-6 via a pathway that is dependent on MAPK in LNCaP (8Ueda T. Bruchovsky N. Sadar M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7076-7085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which these signaling pathways affect AR function is not known. They may modulate AR via phosphorylation of either AR itself or of AR coregulators. For example, activation of the HER2/Neu MAPK pathway results in AR phosphorylation, increasing its ability to recruit coregulators and enhancing AR transactivation (9Wen Y. Hu M.C. Makino K. Spohn B. Bartholomeusz G. Yan D.H. Hung M.C. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6841-6845PubMed Google Scholar). Pyk2 interacts with ARA55 protein and represses AR transactivation via phosphorylation of ARA55 (10Wang X.

In turn, these alternative pathways may affect AR translocation to the nucleus or transcriptional activity via interaction with scaffolding proteins that orchestrate the precise compartmentalization of signal transduction components. It is thought scaffolding proteins cluster signaling proteins thus allowing a tight control of cellular pathways as well as cross-talk between different cascades. Caveolin, a major component of caveolae membrane structures, has been implicated as a principal scaffold for many signal transduction pathways. In a study by Lu et al. (28Lu M.L. Schneider M.C. Zheng Y. Zhang X. Richie J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13442-13451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), caveolin was shown to interact with AR and its overexpression potentiated ligand-dependent AR activation. Recently, we identified filamin, an actin-binding protein also thought to act as a scaffold, as an AR-interacting protein that facilitates ligand-dependent AR nuclear translocation (11Ozanne D.M. Brady M.E. Cook S. Gaughan L. Neal D.E. Robson C.N. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1618-1626Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In filamin-deficient M2 cells AR remained cytoplasmic even after prolonged exposure to androgen. Previous studies have also identified filamin as an interacting partner for caveolin (12Stahlhut M. van Deurs B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 325-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Furthermore, caveolin also appears to have a role in ligand-independent estrogen receptor α nuclear translocation (13Schlegel A. Wang C. Pestell R.G. Lisanti M.P. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The aim of this study was to identify novel AR-interacting proteins involved in movement or signaling from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. A yeast-two hybrid screen identified RACK1 (receptor for activated protein kinase C-1) as an AR-interacting protein. RACK1, a 36-kDa homologue of the β subunit of G proteins, is a member of the WD-40 family of proteins characterized by highly conserved internal WD-40 repeats (Trp-Asp) (14Ron D. Chen C.H.

FEBS Lett. 1992; 307: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). It was initially identified as a protein that interacts with activated PKC and acts as a shuttling protein that coordinates the correct localization of βIIPKC isoform for its function (16Mochly-Rosen D.

We have found RACK1 to have a role in ligand-independent AR movement and transactivation via the PKC signaling pathway suggesting a possible function for this scaffolding protein in AR cross-talk with other signaling pathways. Materials—R1881 was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Dihydrotestosterone, Indolactam V, and monoclonal anti-α tubulin antibody were purchased from Sigma. GF109203X was purchased from Calbiochem. Monoclonal anti-RACK1 antibody was purchased from Transduction Laboratories. Monoclonal anti-AR antibody was purchased from BD Pharmingen. Polyclonal anti-PSA antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Yeast Two-hybrid Analysis—Two-hybrid screening was performed as described previously (25Brady M.E. Ozanne D.M. Gaughan L. Waite I. Cook S. Neal D.E. Robson C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17599-17604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). An hAR fragment comprising residues 559-918, encompassing the DNA-binding and ligand-binding domains was used as bait in the assay. Positive clones were isolated, sequenced and submitted into the GenBank™ data base. One positive clone (RACK1163-317), 0.5 kb in size, gave a 100% homology to the receptor for activated protein kinase C (RACK1, GenBank™ accession no NM_006098). Interaction of RACK1163-317 with truncated forms of the hAR was examined by liquid LacZ assays as previously described (25Brady M.E. Ozanne D.M. Gaughan L. Waite I. Cook S. Neal D.E. Robson C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17599-17604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Deletion Constructs of RACK1 Clones—Four deletion constructs of RACK1163-326 in pACT2 were constructed via deletion of residues from C terminus of the fragment, sequentially deleting individual WD domains. Primers used in PCR to generate the deletion constructs were: WD4-7, 5′-AGCAGCAACCCTATCATCGT-3′; WD5-7, 5′-TCTCCAGATGGATCCCTCTG-3′; WD6-7, 5′-TGCTTCAGCCCTAACCGCTA-3′; WD7, 5′-AAGGCAGAACCACCCCAGT-3′; RACK1 Reverse, 5′-GTGTGCCTAG GTCACCTG-3′. Amplified inserts were cloned into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen) and subcloned into pACT2 via EcoRI site. Orientation was determined via restriction analysis and confirmed by sequencing. Deletion constructs were cotransformed with pAS2-1-AR559-918 into yeast strain PJ69-4A and resultant transformants were grown on media lacking adenine, leucine, and tryptophan. In Vitro Interaction of hAR and RACK1—RACK1163-317 cDNA was excised with EcoRI and XhoI digestion from pACT2 and directionally cloned into pRSETC (Invitrogen) via EcoRI and XhoI sites. hAR fragments used in the yeast two-hybrid analysis were cloned into the EcoRI site of pRSETC from pAS2-1. Constructs were sequenced to confirm the maintenance of the open reading frame. Template DNA was subjected to Geneclean (Anachem) to remove contaminant RNases and the coupled Transcription/Translation Kit (Promega) was used for in vitro interaction analysis. Templates were labeled with [35S]methionine, and the reaction was performed according to the manufacturer's guidelines. Equivalent amounts of labeled protein samples were mixed in immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm Na3VO4, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 25 μg/ml leupeptin, 25 μg/ml aprotinin, 25 μg/ml pepstatin). Interacting proteins were precipitated and visualized as previously described (25Brady M.E. Ozanne D.M. Gaughan L. Waite I. Cook S. Neal D.E. Robson C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17599-17604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Cell Culture—Tissue culture ingredients were purchased from Sigma, unless stated otherwise. LNCaP and COS7 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) (Invitrogen), l-glutamine, 1% penicillin, and 1% streptomycin. Transient Transfections and Luciferase Assays—PC3M cells were seeded in 24-well culture plates (Corning) at densities of 1 × 104 cells/well. After 24 h, cells were transfected using Superfect (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's recommendation with pPSAluc reporter (200 ng), pCMV-β-Gal control plasmid (200 ng), pEGFP-C1AR1-918 (50 ng) and pDSRed-1N1RACK11-326 (100 ng). After 2 h, cells were washed and incubated in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum that had been depleted of steroids by treatment with dextran-coated charcoal (SDM), with the addition of activator/inhibitor as indicated. After 48 h, cells were harvested and assayed for luciferase activity according to the manufacturer's guidelines (Promega). Luciferase activity was corrected for the corresponding β-galactosidase activity to give relative activity. β-galactosidase assays were previously described (25Brady M.E. Ozanne D.M. Gaughan L. Waite I. Cook S. Neal D.E. Robson C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17599-17604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitations—Approximately 1 × 106 LNCaP cells were washed in PBS, harvested, and lysed in reaction lysis buffer on ice for 30 min. Lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 3 min. Supernatants were precleared with 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose (PGS) after three washes in reaction lysis buffer and rotated at 4 °C for 4 h. PGS and nonspecific bound protein were removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 5 min. Immunoprecipitation was performed with 4 μg of polyclonal anti-AR antibody and incubated overnight at 4 °C with rotation. After incubation, a further 20 μl of PGS were added to immunoprecipitated samples and returned to 4 °C for 1 h with rotation. PGS with bound protein complexes was recovered by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 5 min, and samples were washed once in wash buffer A (PBS, 0.2% Triton-X-100, 350 mm NaCl) and twice in wash buffer B (PBS, 0.2% Triton-X-100). Sample buffer (100 mm dithiothreitol, 125 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.005% bromphenol blue) containing 10% β-mercaptoethanol was added to recovered fractions. Samples were denatured and separated by SDS-PAGE, followed by transfer to nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was probed with monoclonal anti-RACK1 antibody. Immunoreaction was visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Western Blotting—LNCaP cells were seeded in 6-well cell culture plates at densities of 1 × 105 cells/well. After 24 h, cells were washed in PBS and incubated for 48 h in SDM in the presence or absence of activators/inhibitors. Adherent cells were lysed directly using SDS sample buffer containing 10% β-mercaptoethanol. Samples were denatured by boiling for 10 min and separated on 12% polyacrylamide gels, followed by transfer to nitrocellulose Hybond™ membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS, 50 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) for 1 h and then incubated with primary antibodies in diluant (1% nonfat milk in TBS-Tween) for 1 h. Primary antibody complexes were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, and protein bands were visualized using ECL reagents. Microscopic Analysis—Full-length hAR (corresponding to residues 1-918) was cloned into the XbaI site of pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) to generate GFP-hAR1-918. Full-length RACK1 (corresponding to residues 1-326) was cloned into pDSRed-1N1 (Clontech) via HindIII and SalI to generate RFP-RACK11-326. Cells were seeded on ethanol-sterilized 22 × 22-mm microscope cover slips in 6-well cell culture plates at densities of 1 × 105 cells/well. After 24 h, cells were washed with PBS and transfected with 1 μg of GFP- and/or RFP-construct using Superfect reagent. After 3 h, cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated overnight in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Following a PBS wash, cells were placed in serum-free containing RPMI 1640 medium for a further 18 h and then exposed to activators or inhibitors. Cover slips were washed with PBS, fixed in methanol for 10 min at -20 °C, dried, inverted on microscope slides and mounted in mounting media (DAKO). Slides were analyzed using a Leica scanning laser confocal microscope. Reverse Transcription PCR—Total RNA was isolated from LNCaP cells using TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer's recommendation (Invitrogen). Complementary DNA was synthesized from 2 μg of total RNA using MMLV reverse transcriptase (Promega) at 37 °C for 60 min. The sequences of the primers for the amplification of PSA cDNA were as follows: forward primer, 5′-CATCAGGAACAAAAGCGTGA-3′ and reverse primer, 5′-TGGGGTCAAGAACTCCTCCTG-3′. This primer pair amplified a 305-bp product. PCR cycle conditions were 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 20 s and 72 °C for 30 s for 25 cycles with an initial denaturation at 94 °C for 3 min and a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. β-Actin, a housekeeping control gene, was used to ensure equal initial RNA amounts. The PCR products were resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining and visualized by UV. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays—LNCaP cells were grown on 150-mm dishes in fetal calf serum-containing RPMI 1640 media for 2 days until approx. 5 × 106 cells were present. 16 h prior to androgen and PKC activator treatment, cells were incubated in steroid-depleted media. Cells were placed in steroid-depleted media supplemented with or without 10 nm R1881 or 10 μm indolactam V for 15 min or 60 min. Following treatment, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were carried out as described (26Gaughan L. Logan I.R. Cook S. Neal D.E. Robson C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25904-25913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Primer sequences for PSA were also described previously (26Gaughan L. Logan I.R. Cook S. Neal D.E. Robson C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25904-25913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). RACK1 Is an AR-interacting Protein—Yeast two-hybrid screening using an AR construct AR559-918 comprising the DNA and ligand-binding domains (DBD and LBD respectively) as bait, identified RACK1 as an AR-interacting protein (Fig. 1). The clone isolated in the screen spanned a region of 154 amino acids from amino acids 163 to 317, designated RACK1163-317. The interaction of AR and RACK1 is enhanced in the presence of ligand, demonstrated by an approximate 5-fold increase in β-galactosidase activity in its presence. Co-transformation of RACK1163-317 with AR deletion constructs in yeast revealed an interaction between RACK1163-317 and the AR fragment AR624-918 comprising the LBD alone upon treatment with ligand. The approximate 3-fold increase in β-galactosidase levels in the presence of 1 μm DHT suggested that additional residues in the DBD further contribute to the interaction or influence the conformational change upon ligand binding. These preliminary data imply that AR interacts with RACK1 in the presence of ligand. RACK1 Interacts with the AR in Vitro and in Vivo—To confirm the data obtained from the yeast two-hybrid system, we sought to determine whether RACK1 could interact with AR in vitro. The interaction was analyzed using in vitro transcription and translation of the proteins labeled with [35S]methionine. Fig. 2A represents in vitro transcribed/translated protein products before immunoprecipitation. Fig. 2B demonstrates that RACK1163-326 interacts with full-length AR (amino acids 1-918), the DBD and LBD (amino acids 559-918) and LDB alone (amino acids 624-918). No interaction was observed between RACK1163-317 and the transactivation domain and DBD (amino acids 1-624). In agreement with the results from the two-hybrid analysis the site of the RACK1 interaction on AR appeared to be around the LBD (amino acids 624-918). Immunoprecipitation and subsequent Western analysis were used to confirm the interaction between RACK1 and AR in vivo. A rabbit polyclonal antibody was used to immunoprecipitate AR protein from prostate LNCaP cells prior to detection of RACK1 by Western blotting. LNCaP cells were also treated with androgen to study the influence of ligand on the interaction. As shown in Fig. 2C, a 36-kDa band, corresponding to RACK1 was observed in the absence (lane 4) and presence of ligand (lane 5) but was absent in control lanes omitting extract (lanes 2 and 3) or antibody (lane 1). Minimal Domain Mapping of AR-RACK1 Interaction—The presence of WD-40 repeats, which have been implicated in protein-protein interactions, within RACK1 suggested that one of these motifs may be responsible for the interaction. The clone isolated in the two-hybrid system, RACK1163-317, contains five out of the seven WD repeat sequences. The minimal domain of RACK1 required to interact with AR was investigated by deleting residues from the C terminus of RACK1163-317. The deletion constructs were tested for their ability to interact with AR559-918 in yeast. Resultant transformants were grown on media lacking adenine, leucine, and tryptophan selecting for both plasmids and for an interaction between the proteins encoded by these plasmids. Interaction between AR559-918 and all RACK1 deletion constructs was observed apart from the RACK1 deletion construct solely encoding the seventh WD40 repeat (RACK1WD7) (Fig. 3). Combined these results implicate the sixth WD40 repeat in the interaction with the AR. RACK1 Is Involved in Ligand-independent AR Nuclear Translocation—To assess the functional significance of AR-RACK1 interaction, the role of RACK1 in AR movement to the nucleus was investigated by fluorescence (confocal) microscopy tagging the interacting proteins with GFP or red fluorescent protein (RFP). A recent report (17Ron D. Jiang Z. Yao L. Vagts A. Diamond I. Gordon A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27039-27046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) proposed RACK1 to act as a PKC shuttling protein that moves βIIPKC upon activation from one intracellular site to another. It has been previously demonstrated using a GFP-AR chimera that unliganded AR is cytoplasmic but rapidly translocates to the nucleus upon addition of ligand (27Georget V. Lobaccaro J.M. Terouanne B. Mangeat P. Nicolas J.C. Sultan C. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1997; 129: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). This ligand-induced nuclear translocation was also observed in this study in COS7 cells (Fig. 4). In the absence of R1881, GFP-AR is predominantly cytoplasmic with background nuclear fluorescence (column 1, row 1). Following a 20-min exposure to steroid, GFP-AR is predominantly nuclear (column 1, row 2). We next determined the localization of RFP-RACK1 in COS7 cells. RFP-RACK1 was found to be cytoplasmic but also localized to a perinuclear structure in unstimulated cells (column 2, row 1). In the basal state, both constructs colocalized in the cytoplasm, displayed by a yellow fluorescent pattern (column 3, row1). Activation by synthetic androgen R1881 induced GFP-AR to move from the cytoplasm to the nucleus while RFP-RACK1 remained in the cytoplasm (column 3, row 2). Ron et al. (17Ron D. Jiang Z. Yao L. Vagts A. Diamond I. Gordon A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27039-27046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) showed RACK1 movement upon PKC activation from the Golgi apparatus to the cell periphery alongside βIIPKC. Also, cross-talk has been reported between the AR and PKC signaling pathways. The PKC signaling pathway has been reported to negatively regulate AR-dependent transcription. Thus, we next sought to examine whether AR translocates to the nucleus in the presence of RACK1 and upon PKC activation. Upon treatment with PKC activator indolactam V, unliganded GFP-AR remained cytoplasmic (column 1, row 3). However, in the presence of RFP-RACK1 androgen-independent nuclear translocation of GFP-AR was observed upon exposure to indolactam V (column 3, row 3). Furthermore, this movement was reduced in the presence of PKC inhibitor GF109203X (column 3, row 4). These results suggest that RACK1 has a role in ligand-independent movement of AR induced by activation of the PKC signaling pathway. RACK1 and Activation of PKC Signaling Pathway Suppress AR Transactivation—We next determined the potential influence of RACK1 on AR transactivation in reporter assays using the pPSALuc reporter. Briefly, AR was transiently transfected into the AR-negative and androgen-independent prostate cancer PC3M cell line in the absence and presence of RACK1 together with pPSALuc. As shown in Fig. 5, R1881 induces AR transactivation up to 6-fold (compare bars 1 and 2). However, the addition of RACK1 repressed androgen-induced AR transactivation to a level comparable to that observed in the absence of R1881 (compare bars 2 and 8). Because we observed androgen-independent AR movement upon PKC activation and in the presence of RACK1, we also investigated their potential effect on androgen-dependent and -independent transcriptional activation of AR. Upon treatment with PKC activator indolactam alone, AR activity was comparable to that observed in the absence of any stimulus (compare bars 1 and 3) whereas upon treatment with PKC inhibitor GF109203X alone, AR activity was enhanced 7.5-fold (compare bars 1 and 4), suggesting a potential role for PKC signaling pathway in ligand-independent AR transactivation. Similarly, GF109203X enhanced R1881-dependent AR transactivation a further 3-fold (compare bars 2 and 6) but indolactam V slightly reduced reporter activity (compare bars 2 and 5). In the presence of GF109203X, the enhancement of reporter activity observed in the presence of AR alone was reduced 5-fold upon cotransfection with RACK1 (compare bars 4 and 10). A reduction was also observed upon treatment with indolactam V (compare bars 3 and 9). The addition of RACK1 also reduced androgen-dependent AR transactivation upon treatment with indolactam V and GF109203X (compare bars 5 and 11, 6 and 12). These results suggest a possible inhibitory role for RACK1. However, GF109203X appears to reverse the repression of both androgen-dependent and -independent AR activity observed upon treatment with indolactam V. PKC Activation Causes a Decrease in AR Recruitment to PSA Promoter—Because PKC activation induces AR movement to the nucleus aided by RACK1 but has a repressive effect upon AR-mediated transcription, we next sought to determine whether the AR is still"
https://openalex.org/W2151799721,"Bone resorption is regulated by the immune system, where receptor activator of nuclear factor (NF)kappaB ligand (RANKL), a new member of the tumor-necrosis factor family, may contribute to pathological conditions. Due to the role of RANKL in the maturation of monocyte-derived osteoclasts, we hypothesized that RANKL could exert chemotactic properties toward monocytic cells. Our results demonstrate that RANKL induces the migration of MonoMac-6 monocytic cells as well as human freshly isolated total peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and CD14+ purified PBMC. RANKL induces the migration of MonoMac-6 cells in a dose-dependent manner and with an efficacy similar to MCP-1. After an 8-h incubation, the soluble form of RANKL (sRANKL) started to exhibit a chemoattractive effect on MonoMac-6 cells, with an increased effect observed up to 24 h. RANKL elicits an additive chemotactic effect to MCP-1. Furthermore, addition of the RANKL decoy receptor osteoprotegerin in the lower well or RANKL in the upper well abrogates the RANKL-induced migration of MonoMac-6 cells, hallmarking a true specific activity. RNase protection assay experiments indicate that exposure of MonoMac-6 cells to RANKL had no significant effect on the expression of a variety of chemokines, known to attract monocytes. This study provides evidence that RANKL behaves as a chemotactic factor for monocytic cells, emphazing the cross-talk between bone and immune systems."
https://openalex.org/W2130496537,"Fhit expression is reduced in most cancers, and Fhit replacement by FHIT expression viruses in lung, esophageal, pancreatic, and cervical cancers induces apoptosis in the cancer cells. Mice carrying one or two inactivated Fhit alleles are hypersensitive to development of N-nitrosomethylbenzylamine (NMBA)-induced forestomach tumors. In the present study, we investigated the kinetics and mechanism of tumor reversal and intervention by oral delivery of FHIT expression viruses. Tumor analysis showed that: a) by 37 days post-NMBA, control mice showed approximately 7 tumors and by 84 days approximately 10 tumors/forestomach; b) mice receiving FHIT virus at 2 or 42 days post-NMBA showed significantly reduced tumor burdens; c) Fhit was still expressed at 82 days postinfection; d) control viral infection had no effect on tumor development; and e) reduced Bcl2, increased Bax expression, and increased TUNEL-positive apoptotic nuclei characterized the restored epithelia of FHIT transduced forestomachs. Thus, FHIT viral gene delivery prevents or retards development of carcinogen-induced forestomach tumors and reverses development of established tumors by 60-70% through an apoptotic pathway. This dramatic reduction in tumor burden emphasizes the efficacy of targeting the FHIT apoptotic pathway for tumor eradication."
https://openalex.org/W2152867369,"A unique tissue-engineered model of peripheral nerve regeneration was developed in vitro to study neurite outgrowth. Mouse dorsal root ganglia neurons were seeded on a collagen sponge populated with human endothelial cells and/or human fibroblasts. Addition of nerve growth factor (NGF; 10 ng/ml) was not required for sensory neurons survival but was necessary to promote neurite outgrowth, as assessed by immunostaining of the 150 kDa neurofilament. A vigorous neurite elongation was detected inside the reconstructed tissue after 14 and 31 days of neurons culture, reaching up to 770 microm from day 14. Axons were often observed closely associated with the capillary-like tubes reconstructed in the model, in a similar pattern as in the human dermis. The presence of endothelial cells induced a significant increase of the neurite elongation after 14 days of culture. The addition of human keratinocytes totally avoided the twofold decrease in the amount of neurites observed between 14 and 31 days in controls. Besides the addition of NGF, axonal growth did not necessitate B27 supplement or glial cell coculture to be promoted and stabilized for long-term culture. Thus, this model might be a valuable tool to study the effect of various cells and/or attractive or repulsive molecules on neurite outgrowth in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W2157660001,"The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is involved in the removal of damaged proteins and the activation of transcription factors, such as nuclear-factor-kappaB. Recent reports, however, questioned the functional activity of the UPS under conditions of increased oxidative stress, such as experimental hypercholesterolemia, which was the objective of our study. Pigs were placed on a normal chow diet (N) or on a hypercholesterolemic diet without (HC) or with vitamin C and E supplementation (HC+VIT) for 12 weeks. Compared with N, plasma concentration of total cholesterol increased in both HC and HC+VIT [76 +/- 21 vs. 400 +/- 148 (P<0.05) and 329 +/- 102 (P<0.05) mg/dL], whereas increase in lipid peroxidation, as assessed by LDL-malondialdehyde plasma concentration, was found in HC but not in HC+VIT [6.6 +/- 0.7 vs. 8.5 +/- 0.3 (P<0.05) and 6.8 +/- 0.7 nmol/mg protein]. In comparison with N, the level of ubiquitin conjugates in the coronary artery, as assessed by immunoblotting, increased by 42% in HC but not in HC+VIT and was localized predominantly to media vascular smooth muscle cells by immunostaining. There was no difference in proteasome proteolytic activity among the study groups. These results demonstrate that the UPS is functionally active in early atherogenesis despite increase in oxidative stress with important repercussions in the pathophysiology and therapy of cardiovascular diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2009429943,"The suggested involvement of ouabain in hypertension raised the need for a better understanding of its cellular action, but the mechanisms of ouabain toxicity are only now being uncovered. In the present study, we show that reduced glutathione (GSH) protected ouabain-sensitive (OS) cells from ouabain-induced toxicity and that the inhibition of GSH synthesis by D, L-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine (BSO) sensitized ouabain-resistant (OR) cells. We could not observe formation of *OH or H2O2, but there was an increase in O2*-only in OS cells. Unexpectedly, an increased number of OR cells depolarized after treatment with ouabain, and BSO blocked this depolarization. Moreover, GSH increased ouabain-induced depolarization in OS cells. A sustained increase in tyrosine phosphorylation (P-Tyr) and Ras expression was observed after treatment of OS cells, and GSH prevented it. Conversely, BSO induced P-Tyr and Ras expression in ouabain-treated OR cells. The results obtained have three major implications: There is no direct correlation between membrane depolarization and ouabain-induced cell death; ouabain toxicity is not directly related to its classical action as a Na+, K+-ATPase inhibitor but seems to be associated to signal transduction, and GSH plays a major role in preventing ouabain-induced cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2048410022,"The principal regulator of p53 stability is HDM2, an E3 ligase mediating p53 degradation via the ubiquitin-26S proteasome pathway. Until recently, the accepted model held that p53 degradation occurs exclusively on cytoplasmic proteasomes, with an absolute requirement for nuclear export of p53 via the CRM1 pathway. However, 26S proteasomes are abundant in cytosol and nucleus. Using forced overexpression of HDM2 in mutant p53 tumor cells, we previously found that p53 degradation occurs in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. p53 null cells coexpressing export-defective p53 and HDM2 retained partial competence for p53 degradation, challenging the obligatory export model. Because the ability of local nuclear destruction might add important control in switching off the p53 pathway, we now test this notion for physiological situations in untransfected cells and determine the significance of this regulation. Despite nuclear export blockade by leptomycin B and HTLV1-Rex protein, two potent CRM1 inhibitors, nuclear degradation of endogenous wild-type p53 and HDM2 occurs during down-regulation of the p53 response. This was seen in RKO and U2OS cells recovering from all major forms of DNA damage, including UV, gamma-IR, camptothecin, or cisplatinum. Moreover, significant nuclear degradation of endogenous p53 and HDM2 occurs in isolated nuclear fractions prepared from these recovering cells. Furthermore, nuclear proteasomes efficiently degrade ubiquitinated p53 in vitro. Our data indicate that in nonlethal outcomes of cellular stress, when DNA damage has been successfully repaired and the active p53 response needs to be down-regulated quickly to resume normal homeostasis, both nuclear and cytoplasmic proteasomes are recruited to efficiently degrade the elevated p53 and HDM2 protein levels. The physiological significance of local nuclear destruction lies in the fact that it adds tighter control and speed to switching the p53 pathway off."
https://openalex.org/W2046945063,"Human securin, known also as PTTG, has established oncogenic and cell cycle regulatory functions. PTTG/securin transforms cells in vitro, inhibits sister chromatid separation, and regulates secretion of fibroblast growth factor-2. FGF-2 is a key regulator of CNS development and PTTG/securin expression has been reported in murine fetal brain. We examined the expression and function of securin and FGF-2 in the developing human fetal brain and in a fetal neuronal cell line (NT 2). Securin expression was significantly reduced in first and second trimester fetal cerebral cortex compared with adult cerebral cortex, where immunocytochemistry revealed intense securin staining in neuronal cell bodies. FGF-2 protein was concordantly lower in fetal cortex, whereas pretranslational expression of PTTG binding factor (PBF) was not significantly altered in fetal brain compared with adult. PCNA expression demonstrated that high securin levels in adult cortex were associated with absent cell proliferation. In NT-2 cells, securin stimulated FGF-2 expression, which could be abrogated by a carboxyl-terminal mutation. Low transient expression of securin resulted in a significant proliferative effect, whereas high levels of securin expression inhibited cell turnover. We propose a potential role for human PTTG/securin in modulating cell proliferation and FGF-2 expression during human neurogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2053645221,"Numerous factors including ultraviolet (UV) radiation and growth factors regulate the specific function of epidermal melanocytes. A recently discovered epidermal growth factor is sAPP, the soluble N-terminal ectodomain of the beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP). Using whole mount preparations of isolated human epidermis, we detected a small population of basal cells, which expressed exceptionally high levels of APP. These cells were identified as melanocytes, which, similar to keratinocytes and neuronal cells, expressed the three APP isoforms 695, 751, and 770. They differed in their expression pattern from that of neuronal cells by expressing only low levels of APP 695. Melanocytes and melanoma cells in vitro released, in addition to keratinocytes, large quantities of sAPP. Because of its growth factor function, we studied possible effects of sAPP on melanocytes. Recombinant sAPP strongly increased lamellipodia activity at dendritic tips, an effect that coincided with increased release of melanin particles. Our observations point to the possible use of APP as an immunocytochemical marker for melanocytes. They suggest that sAPP derived from keratinocytes and/or melanocytes belongs to a family of factors operating in the paracrine and/or autocrine regulation of melanocyte function."
https://openalex.org/W2053927697,"VEGF, an endothelial-specific mitogen, is an important tumor angiogenesis growth factor. The major receptor for VEGF on endothelial cells is KDR. We hypothesized that an intrabody could bind newly synthesized KDR and block receptor transport to the cell surface, thereby inhibiting important VEGF effects. We expressed a single chain antibody (p3S5) to KDR with or without the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention signal (KDEL), using either a plasmid (p3S5-HAK) or a tet-off adenoviral system (Ad-HAK). Plasmid-mediated expression of the tethered intrabody significantly reduced KDR expression (from 82.5+/-12.5% to 27.9+/-13.6% of cells; P<0.01) and thymidine incorporation in successfully transfected cells. Ad-HAK infection resulted in intrabody expression in >90% of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), producing marked (80%) apoptosis at 48 h postinfection. The intrabody was essential for these effects, as confirmed by inhibiting its expression with doxycycline or by expressing irrelevant genes (lacZ, GFP). Cell death was dependent on KDR, because Ad-HAK infection of cell lines with minimal or no KDR had little effect on cell viability. Infected HUVECs were unable to form tubes on Engelbreth Holm-Swarm (EHS) tumor gel matrix. These results demonstrate the potential for development of an intrabody-based strategy to block angiogenesis and prevent tumor growth."
https://openalex.org/W2127817163,"The human iNOS (hiNOS) gene is expressed in a tissue-specific manner, but the molecular basis for this regulation has not been elucidated. Here, we show that liver cell-specific hiNOS gene activation involves protein-DNA binding to an A-activator binding site (AABS) located at -192 nucleotides in the hiNOS promoter region. Mutation of this site in the -7.2 kb hiNOS promoter construct inhibited basal hiNOS promoter activity in primary rat hepatocytes (77%), and two human liver cell lines, AKN-1 (63%) and HepG2 (60%), but had no significant effect on basal hiNOS activity in three non-hepatic human cell types. Interestingly, mutation of AABS significantly abrogated cytokine-induced promoter activity in all cell types. C/EBPbeta transcription factor bound to AABS by gel shift assay. Overexpression of C/EBPbeta active form (LAP) increased hiNOS basal promoter activity approximately sixfold in liver cells, but had minimal effect in non-hepatic cells. In contrast, overexpression of the transcriptional inhibitor (LIP) strongly suppressed both basal and cytokine-inducible promoter activity. These data show that the cis-acting AABS DNA element mediates liver-specific basal hiNOS promoter activity through binding of the trans-acting C/EBPbeta factor. Further, C/EBPbeta binding to AABS functions as a ""switchpoint"" that is necessary for cytokine-inducible hiNOS gene expression in all cell types examined."
https://openalex.org/W2163238032,"Phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (PHGPx), a selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase, can interact with lipophilic substrates, including the phospholipid hydroperoxides, fatty-acid hydroperoxides, and cholesteryl ester hydroperoxides, and reduce them to hydroxide compounds. We studied the functional role of endogenous PHGPx in regulation of 12(S)-lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase 1 activities in human epidermoid carcinoma A431 cells by using a cell system overexpressing anti-PHGPx mRNA. A retroviral expression vector designated as L1-3, wherein cDNA of PHGPx was reversely inserted into pFB-ERV in antisense orientation, was constructed. A number of stable transfectants of A431 cells with PHGPx depletion were generated from virions containing plasmid L1-3. In an intact cell assay system, the metabolism of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin E2 and 12(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid was significantly enhanced in stable L1-3 transfectants compared with that in vector-control cells. Flow cytometric analysis revealed a significant elevated level of intracellular hydroperoxides in stable L1-3 transfectants. Treatment of stable L1-3 transfectants with 50 microM arsenite induced more significant formation of intracellular hydroperoxides than that of vector-control cells. Taken together, these results support the notion that the endogenous PHGPx plays a pivotal role in the regulation of 12(S)-lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase 1 activities by reducing the level of intracellular lipid hydroperoxides in arachidonate metabolism in A431 cells."
https://openalex.org/W2026532121,"Alterations in hepatic glucose metabolism play a key role in the development of the hyperglycemia observed in type 2 diabetes. Because the transcription factor c-Myc induces hepatic glucose uptake and utilization and blocks gluconeogenesis, we examined whether hepatic overexpression of c-myc counteracts the insulin resistance induced by a high-fat diet. After 3 months on this diet, control mice became obese, hyperglycemic, and hyperinsulinemic, indicating that they had developed insulin resistance. In contrast, transgenic mice remained lean and showed improved glucose disposal and normal levels of blood glucose and insulin, indicating that they had developed neither obesity nor insulin resistance. These findings were concomitant with normalization of hepatic glucokinase and pyruvate kinase gene expression and enzyme activity, which led to normalization of intrahepatic glucose-6-phosphate and glycogen content. In the liver of control mice fed a high-fat diet, the expression of genes encoding proteins that control energy metabolism, such as sterol receptor element binding protein 1-c, peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha, and uncoupling protein-2, was altered. In contrast, in the liver of transgenic mice fed a high-fat diet, the expression of these genes was normal. These results suggest that c-myc overexpression counteracted the obesity and insulin resistance induced by a high-fat diet by modulating the expression of genes that regulate hepatic metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2117970894,"We sought to study the possible physiological function of thioltransferase (TTase) in combating oxidative damage in the lens epithelial cells. The cells transfected with either TTase-containing plasmid or vector only were compared for their resistance to oxidative stress in the presence of a bolus of H2O2 (0.1 mM) for 3 h. Cells depleted of TTase activity upon cadmium treatment were also examined for the resistance to oxidative stress under the same conditions. TTase activity assay, Western blot, and Northern blot analyses confirmed that hTTase gene was successfully transfected into the HLE B3 cells and was overexpressed. The TTase-transfected cells detoxified H2O2 as efficiently as the control cells but displayed a faster and more complete recovery of oxidatively inactivated glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities and suppressed protein thiolation (PSSG formation). With TTase activity being inhibited by cadmium, the spontaneous reactivation of GAPDH under bolus H2O2 treatment was not accomplished in cadmium-pretreated cells. These data indicate a new physiological function of TTase, which involves in the reactivation of the oxidatively inactivated enzymes through dethiolation; thus this redox-regulating enzyme can protect the human lens epithelial cells and maybe other cell types by preventing them from permanent oxidative damage."
https://openalex.org/W2148032486,"We report that CYP3a13 gene, located on mouse chromosome 5, spans 27.5 Kb and contains 13 exons. The transcription start site is 35 bp upstream of the coding region and results in a 109 bp 5' untranslated region. CYP3a13 promoter shows putative binding sites for retinoid X receptor, pregnane X receptor, and estrogen receptor. CYP3a13 shows a broad tissue distribution with predominant expression in liver. Although CYP3a13 shares 92% nucleotide identity with the female-specific rat CYP3A9, its expression does not exhibit sexual dimorphism. Ligand activation of peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor-gamma and retinoid X receptor inhibit expression of CYP3a13 at the transcription level in a tissue-specific manner. Another novel finding is hepatic induction of CYP3a13 by dexamethasone occurring only in pregnane X receptor null mice. We also report that pregnane X receptor is essential to maintain robust in vivo basal levels of CYP3a13 in contrast to CYP3a11. CYP3a13 protein expressed in vitro can metabolize clinically active drugs ethylmorphine and erythromycin, as well as benzphetamine. We conclude that CYP3a13 is regulated differentially by various nuclear receptors. In humans this may lead to altered drug metabolism, as many of the newly synthesized ligands/drugs targeted toward these nuclear receptors could influence CYP3A gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2027461004,"Nerve growth factor (NGF) is a potent mediator of inflammatory hyperalgesia, in addition to roles in the development and maintenance of neurons. We provide evidence for the novel concept that microvascular endothelial cells play a critical primary role in NGF-mediated events that lead to inflammatory hyperalgesia in rat skin. We show that, surprisingly, neutrophils are not directly activated by NGF, although local administration of NGF mediates thermal hyperalgesia via mechanisms involving concomitant neutrophil accumulation. The co-administration of actinomycin D with NGF negated both neutrophil accumulation and thermal hyperalgesia, indicating the dependence of NGF on local de novo protein synthesis. More significantly, an antibody against the endothelial-derived adhesion molecule ICAM-1 also blocked neutrophil accumulation and thermal hyperalgesia. Finally the ability of NGF to stimulate ICAM-1 in human cultured umbilical vein endothelial cells is shown. We propose that NGF acts primarily to activate endothelial cells and that this response is essential for the ensuing neutrophil accumulation and hyperalgesia. The findings reveal a central role of the endothelial cell in initiating NGF-dependent inflammatory hyperalgesia and emphasize the importance of further investigations aimed at examining the feasibility of new therapeutic strategies that target NGF."
https://openalex.org/W2170794453,"As part of our research into the liver-directed gene therapy of Type I diabetes, we have engineered a human hepatoma cell line (HEPG2ins/g cells) to store and secrete insulin to a glucose stimulus. The aim of the present study was to determine whether HEPG2ins/g cells respond to glucose via signaling pathways that depend on ATP-sensitive potassium channels (KATP). Using patch-clamp electrophysiology with symmetrical KCl solutions, the single-channel conductance of KATP was 61pS. KATP was inhibited by ATP (1 mM) or cAMP (50 microM) applied to the cytosolic side of the membrane. Single KATP channels and macroscopic whole-cell currents were inhibited by glucose (20 mM) and glibenclamide (20 microM) and were activated by diazoxide (150 microM). Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis confirmed the presence of Kir6.2 KATP channel subunit protein in HEPG2ins/g and HEPG2ins cells. Using radioimmunoassay techniques, we report that exposure of the cells to tolbutamide (100 microM) resulted in an increase in insulin secretion from 0.3 +/- 0.05 to 1.8 +/- 0.2 pmol insulin/10(6) cells and glibenclamide (20 microM) from 0.4 +/- 0.06 to 2.1 +/- 0.3 (n=4), similar to what is seen on glucose (20 mM) stimulation. Diazoxide (150 microM) completely inhibited glucose-stimulated insulin release. Glucose 20 mM and glibenclamide 100 microM increased intracellular Ca2+ level in the HEPG2ins/g cells. However, glucose 20 mM did not stimulate a rise in intracellular Ca2+ in the un-transfected parent cell-line HEPG2. We used confocal microscopy to confirm that glucose (20 mM) stimulated the release of insulin from the fluorescently labeled secretion granules in the cells. Furthermore, glibenclamide (20 microM) also stimulated the release of insulin from fluorescently labeled secretion granules, and diazoxide (150 microM) blocked that stimulated release of insulin. Our results suggest that HEPG2ins/g cells respond to glucose via signaling pathways that depend on KATP, similar to a normal pancreatic beta cell."

https://openalex.org/W2014483367,"An unusual 38 codon sequence was previously isolated from a random peptide library by binding to growth hormone binding protein in phage display. This sequence, H10, and several variants did not contain open reading frames, but expressed a beta-galactosidase reporter 10-40% as well as control in both the original reading frame from phage display and the frame -1 to it. Inspection of the sequence suggested that expression in the -1 frame resulted from initiation at a downstream ATG in that frame, present in H10 and its variants, subsequently confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis. Unexpectedly, mutagenesis of that out-of-frame downstream ATG also increased expression in the original non-open reading frame by two- to threefold, creating a TTG codon adjacent to an existing in-frame TTG codon, suggesting downstream translational reinitiation at a putative TTG start. We undertook an extensive site-directed mutagenesis approach and report that this hypothesis is almost certainly correct. Features required for this reinitiation include an upstream translation start and a stop that can even be a suppressed amber codon 22 nucleotides further downstream from the restart. Replacing the TTG with ATG increases expression only twofold. Reinitiation occurs in either of two reading frames in this sequence."
