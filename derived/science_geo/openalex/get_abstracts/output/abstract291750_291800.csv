https://openalex.org/W2062493172,"Eye-head coordination was investigated by recording from the neck and eye muscles in monkeys. The results show that (i) during eye-head turning, neural activity reaches the neck muscles before the eye muscles, and (ii) all agonist neck muscles are activated simultaneously regardless of the initial head position. Since overt movement of the eyes precedes that of the head, it was concluded that the central neural command initiates the eye-head sequence but does not specify its serial order. Furthermore, it was determined that the compensatory eye movement is not initiated centrally but instead is dependent upon reflex activation arising from movement of the head."

Limitation of the reproduction of the presently dominant phytoplankton organisms, which require silica, may lead to drastic and, on the whole, undesirable changes in the ecosystem."

Hydrogen sulfide is the initial photon acceptor in this work; superthermal atomic hydrogen photodissociation products appear to initiate reactions leading to amino acid synthesis with an overall quantum yield on the order of 5X10(-5)."

https://openalex.org/W1967249340,"In Scandinavia, highways and railroads have not generally created obstructions to the movement of domesticated reindeer, although thousands of animals are killed each year in accidents. Some disruption in the movements of wild reindeer in Norway has been associated with the construction of a railroad and highway through an alpine plateau south of Trondheim. Hydroelectric projects have had the greatest detrimental effects on reindeer by flooding rangelands and obstructing migration routes. Special problems are created by the fluctuating water levels in reservoirs and rivers; efforts to mitigate the effects of these fluctuations have been only partially successful. Reindeer have strong traditions for migrating along specific routes, and realignment of these routes is extremely difficult. Conflicts of interest exist between reindeer herders and foresters. During their winter feeding, the deer damage young trees. The cutting of forests usually results in a deterioration of the area as a rangeland for reindeer. Herbicides used in forestry have been implicated in the death of some reindeer in Sweden, and research is now under way to determine the effects of herbicides on reindeer. The increased use of fences in reindeer husbandry in Scandinavia has emphasized the fact that reindeer behavior and characteristics of the terrain must be considered if fences are to be successful in directing or controlling the movements of reindeer. Herders now use snowmobiles instead of reindeer for transportation and herding, but the machines disturb the reindeer and must be used with discretion. Recent evidence indicates that large amounts of industrial waste in the atmosphere are carried from the British Isles and central Europe to Scandinavia, where they fall out in rain and snow. This has raised concern about the influence of the wastes on lichens, the main winter food supply of reindeer. Studies are now under way in Finland, Sweden, and Norway, through the International Biological Program, to determine the growth rates of the several lichen species that are important to reindeer."

This compares with 29 to 68 percent of the total variation that can be attributed to the secular rise of sea level, and with 10 to 50 percent of the variation that cannot be attributed to either the river inflow or the secular rise."
https://openalex.org/W2018683985,"The posterior sublingual gland of sea snakes is a salt gland. It secretes a fluid surpassing seawater in sodium chloride concentration. The gland lies on the ventrolateral surfaces of the tongue sheath and empties through multiple ducts into the sheath. Fluid is expelled from the sheath when the tongue is extended. For freshly captured Pelamis, the plasma concentrations of sodium, chloride, and potassium were 210, 167, and 8 millimoles per liter, respectively. Injections of sodium chloride led to a rise in its concentration in the plasma and to an increase in the rate and concentration of fluid secreted by the sublingual gland. The ultrastructure of this gland is similar to that of other reptilian salt glands. However, the gland is not homologous with any other salt gland. The sublingual gland in Pelamis is larger than that in Laticauda, and the rate of electrolyte excretion from the larger gland is greater."
https://openalex.org/W1976819713,"Hydrolyzates of aqueous extracts of Apollo 11 fines, an Apollo 12 trench sample, and an Apollo 12 surface sample have been analyzed on an ultrasensitive amino acid analyzer. The total content of amino acids recovered ranged from 20 to 70 parts per billion of lunar soil. Amino acids are not recovered by the direct hydrolysis of lunar fines, presumably because of decomposition in the presence of the large excess of lunar mineral. As judged by retention time, glycine is the dominant amino acid found; alanine is secondarily present in each case in the profile. Only a few amino acids have been recorded in each analysis. The pattern is relatively consistent in the samples from the three locations; the pattern from either hydrolyzed or unhydrolyzed extracts differs markedly from that of hydrolyzed or unhydrolyzed handprints. The evidence is not consistent with contamination of the kind expected by many investigators."
https://openalex.org/W1964119397,"The neuston net has been modified to obtain quantitative samples of surface zooplankton. Petroleum lumps are commonly taken with these nets, and quantities of tar up to almost 0.1 gram (wet weight) per cubic meter of filtered surface water have been taken in the northwestern Atlantic. This information is used to estimate the quantity of tar lumps present in the North Atlantic and to indicate the probable limits of the degree of existing oil pollution in this region. It is suggested that previous estimates of ocean oil pollution may be too low."

https://openalex.org/W2038704935,"Considerable information concerning lunar chronology has been obtained by the study of rocks and soil returned by the Apollo 11 and Apollo 12 missions. It has been shown that at the time the moon, earth, and solar system were formed, ∼4.6 × 109 years ago, a severe chemical fractionation took place, resulting in depletion of relatively volatile elements such as Rb and Pb from the sources of the lunar rocks studied. It is very likely that much of this material was lost to interplanetary space, although some of the loss may be associated with internal chemical differentiation of the moon."

The traps, dated by tree-rings at A.D. 350 and 1300 B.C., contained a major complex of pine-sagebrush pollen and traces of other species, representing the equivalent of the present vegetation."

https://openalex.org/W2044059381,"Petrologists can make significant contributions to the plate tectonic concept. Fixing the stability fields of the principal rock types involved will provide the limits of pressure and temperature of the various environments. Experimental determination of the partition coefficients of the trace elements will be helpful. Studies of the partial melting behavior of possible parental materials in the absence and presence of water, especially the undersaturated region, will contribute to the understanding of magma production. Experimental observations on the rheological properties of the peridotites below and just above the solidus will lead to a better evaluation of the convective mechanism. Measurement of the fundamental properties of rocks, such as the density of solids and liquids at high pressures and temperatures, would contribute to understanding the concepts of diapiric rise, magma segregation, and the low-velocity zone. Broader rock sampling of the oceanic areas of all environments will do much to define the petrologic provinces. The field petrologist specializing in the Paleozoic regions and Precambrian shields can contribute by examining those regions for old plate boundaries and devising new criteria for their recognition."

https://openalex.org/W2083658145,"Range in air and total ionization by electrons of energy up to 2225 volts.---Electrons from a tungsten filament were accelerated to a cylindrical anode with a small axial hole through which a fraction passed into a hemispherical ionization chamber maintained at a definite pressure by means of an adjustable leak, while the filament chamber was connected to a diffusion pump. The number of electrons entering the ionization chamber and the number of positive ions formed by them was measured with an electrometer. From ionization-pressure curves the range of electrons of various energies was determined, and was found to obey the fourth-power velocity law $R\ensuremath{\propto}{v}^{4}$, or $\sqrt{R}=\frac{V}{15900}$, where $V$ is the energy in equivalent volts and $R$ is in cm at atmospheric pressure. The total ionization curve begins at 17 volts, and rises with minor peaks at 127, 250, 375 and 494 volts of 1.83, 2.70, 4.10 and 5.05 ions per electron, to 43.2 ions per electron at 1000 volts; then the increase is approximately linear to 55 ions per electron at 2225 volts, and the values of others for high speed electrons indicate that this increase continues at about the same rate. These results tend to confirm Bohr's theory of ionization as corrected by Fowler. The voltages at which the total ionization shows peaks are interpreted as the ionization potentials of the L-electrons of argon (250) and the K-electrons of nitrogen (375) and of oxygen (494). The ionization per cm of path at 1 mm pressure, obtained by di viding the total ionization by the range, reaches a maximum of 112 ions/cm for 40 volts and a second maximum of 13.9 ions/cm for 987 volts. The first maximum agrees with that predicted from the ionization potentials of the molecule and atom of nitrogen, and the second corresponds to twice the ionization potential for the K-electrons of oxygen and gives a value of 22.8 volts energy per ion pair produced, in agreement with theory. For electrons with 40 volts energy, Bohr's theory gives the maximum effective radius of air molecules during collision as approximately 5\ifmmode\times\else\texttimes\fi{}${10}^{\ensuremath{-}8}$ cm. The 987 volt electrons are probably those which give the sphere tracks in C. T. R. Wilson's photographs. Their range is.04 mm at atmospheric pressure."
