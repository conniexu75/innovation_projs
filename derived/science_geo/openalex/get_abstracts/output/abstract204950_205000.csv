This enzyme, which is highly localized in the pineal gland, also O-methylates serotonin."

Since pyrogallol also prolongs the physiological effects of epinephrine, it is suggested that catechol-O-methyl transferase terminates the actions of the catecholamine hormones."

https://openalex.org/W2069749400,"Punishment is found to produce a large reduction in reinforced responses when it is initially introduced. Continued exposure to punishment, however, results in substantial recovery within each hour of exposure as well as from day to day. A compensatory increase in responding occurs after the removal of punishment, even after the punishment has ceased to be effective."

https://openalex.org/W2039258943,"MANY drugs enhance or block the actions of adrenaline; but little is known as to whether they act by modifying the metabolism of the catecholamine. In this work the effects of a variety of drugs on the rate of disappearance of radioactive adrenaline in the whole mouse were examined. Details of drug dosage are given in Table 1. Mice were treated with drug and then adrenaline (3 Âµgm.) labelled with H-3 was administered intravenously. Ten minutes after the adrenaline injection the animals were killed, homogenized in a Waring blendor, and an aliquot of the homogenate assayed for labelled adrenaline remaining1. Control animals, untreated with drug, were given adrenaline labelled with H-3 at a similar time."

The pure antibody could be precipitated anew by the antigen. Antibodies to tyrosylgelatin were isolated in a similar way, but in this case peptides containing the active antigenic sites remained bound to the antibody."

https://openalex.org/W2039127556,beta-Aminoisobutyric acid was isolated from organ extracts of Mytilus edulis. Ion-exchange resins and large-scale paper chromatography were used to isolate minute quantities of the compound. beta-Aminoisobutyric acid was identified by paper chromatography in several solvents and by conversion to DNP-beta-aminoisobutyric acid and subsequent chromatography of the derivative in several solvents.

https://openalex.org/W2093143890,"A linear relationship between dose of internal radiation and two effects, which implies no threshold, is shown to be a possible interpretation of data given by Finkel in ""Mice, men and fallout"". This interpretation is at variance with that offered by Finkel, which was that the dose-effect relationship is nonlinear and indicates a threshold."

https://openalex.org/W2031097247,"NERURKAR et al. 1 have shown that administration of methionine either before or after X-irradiation decreases the damage caused to nucleic acid synthesis in irradiated rats. Post-irradiation administration of methionine appears to be more effective. Other assays have shown a lower increase in nitrogen, uric acid and in creatinine excretion in irradiated rats injected with methionine after irradiation2. The increase in uric acid excretion suggests excessive breakdown of nucleic acids as a result of cellular destruction. Treatment with methionine also results in a beneficial influence on the rate of growth after irradiation."

Procedures for the preparation of cell cultures on beads, and for the recognition and manipulation of beads carrying single monocytes, HeLa cells, and Detroit-98 cells are described. Data obtained with Brucella infected monocytes, illustrating the efficiency of the method, are presented."

https://openalex.org/W2007216297,"THERE has been some debate whether the brain is determinate or probabilistic in its behaviour. As a contribution to this question, the following argument shows that from one point of view the determinate system is demonstrably of greater efficiency than the probabilistic. The physiologist may therefore expect to find that natural selection has made the brain as determinate as possible."

In the thin layer where the effluent oxidizes (presumably ferrous carbonate or bicarbonate to hydrated ferric oxide) the bacteria develop."
