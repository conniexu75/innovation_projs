https://openalex.org/W2043344747,"Embryogenic cultures of Daucus carota treated with 1 millimolar alpha-difluoromethylarginine, a specific inhibitor of arginine decarboxylase, exhibited nearly a 50 percent reduction in embryo formation compared with controls. Putrescine and spermidine concentrations in the treated cells were greatly reduced. Addition of putrescine, spermidine, or spermine to the culture medium restored embryogenesis in the treated cultures. Embryogenesis was not significantly affected by alpha-difluoromethylornithine, an inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase. These results suggest that polyamines have a major function in plant embryo development and that the wild carrot synthesizes polyamines through the biosynthetic pathway involving arginine decarboxylase rather than ornithine decarboxylase."

Such activity is probably short-lived compared to galactic lifetimes, and was most prevalent when the universe was only about one-fifth of its present age. A massive black hole seems the inevitable end point of such activity, and dead quasars should greatly outnumber active ones. In recent years, studies of stellar motions in the cores of several nearby galaxies indicate the presence of central dark masses which could be black holes. This article discusses how such evidence might be corroborated, and the potential implications for our understanding of active galaxies and black holes."

Applied to the main problem in artificial satellite theory, for instance, the technique reveals an intricate configuration of equilibria and bifurcations when the polar component of the angular momentum approaches zero."

https://openalex.org/W2052912949,"Scientists from NOAA and Exxon dispute whether the Prince William Sound ecosystem is recovering from the Exxon Valdez spill. NOAA scientists claim that the Sound is still staggering from a major ecological blow and that crude oil weathering products are contaminating vast numbers of Alaskan wildlife. Exxon scientists claim that most of the biota of the Sound is returning to full strength and is largely free of oil from the spill. At the heart of the dispute is the technique of hydrocarbon fingerprinting to identify the source of crude. Exxon scientists claim that government scientists do not know how to interpret the data, and that what they claim is contamination from Valdez crude actually comes from other sources, such as diesel soot from the smokestacks of ships used to collect fish for study. NOAA scientists claim that hydrocarbon fingerprinting is an inappropriate method for tracking oil-spill damage to biota, due to the varied ways in which living organisms metabolize petroleum."
