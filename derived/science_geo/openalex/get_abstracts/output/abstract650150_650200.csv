https://openalex.org/W3014711022,"Health, the environment, and animal rights represent the three main reasons people cite for vegetarian diet in Western societies. However, it has not been shown that these motives can be distinguished empirically, and little is known about what kind of people are likely to be compelled by these different motives. This study had three goals. First, we aimed to use construct validation to test whether develop health, environmental, and animal rights motives for a vegetarian diet could be distinguished. Second, we evaluated whether these motivations were associated with different demographic, behavioral, and personality profiles in three diverse samples. Third, we examined whether peoples' motivations were related to responses to vegetarian advocacy materials. We created the Vegetarian Eating Motives Inventory, a 15-item measure whose structure was invariant across three samples (N = 1006, 1004, 5478) and two languages (English and Dutch). Using this measure, we found that health was the most common motive for non-vegetarians to consider vegetarian diets and it had the broadest array of correlates, which primarily involved communal and agentic values. Correlates of environmental and animal rights motives were limited, but these motives were strong and specific predictors of advocacy materials in a fourth sample (N = 739). These results provide researchers with a useful tool for identifying vegetarian motives among both vegetarian and non-vegetarian respondents, offer useful insights into the nomological net of vegetarian motivations, and provide advocates with guidance about how to best target campaigns promoting a vegetarian diet."
https://openalex.org/W3014131759,"Violence against health care workers is a major issue in health care organisations and is estimated to affect 95% of workers, presenting an enormous risk for workers and employers. Current interventions generally aim at managing rather than preventing or minimising violent incidents. To create better-targeted interventions, it has been suggested to shift attention to the perpetrators of violence. The aim of this study was to identify and discuss the perceptions, held by Emergency Department nurses, about perpetrators of occupational violence and aggression.Two focus groups were conducted with Emergency Department nurses at a major metropolitan hospital in Australia. In the focus groups, the nurses' perceptions about perpetrators of violence against health care workers were identified and discussed. The results were analysed using descriptive analysis.This study confirmed that violence is a major issue for Emergency Department nurses and has a considerable impact on them. Participants acknowledged that violence at work had become an intrinsic part of their job and they tend to focus on coping mechanisms. The nurses identified six overlapping groups of perpetrators and described their approach to dealing with these perpetrators. The results highlighted additional factors that impact on the occurrence and management of violence, such as the presence of security, wait times, and the triage system.Based on the focus groups with Emergency Department nurses we conclude that violence at work is an everyday danger for Emergency Department nurses, who feel vulnerable and recognise that it is not within their power to solve this issue given the societal component. Our conclusion is that attention needs to shift from equipping workers with tools to manage violence to the perpetrator and the development of interventions to reduce violence from targeted perpetrator groups."

However, little is known about the TIICs of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and its impact on the prognosis of patients and potential for immunotherapy. We applied CIBERSORT of 1090 tumors to infer the infiltration of 22 subsets of TIICs using gene expression data. Unsupervised clustering analysis by 22 TIICs revealed 4 clusters of tumors, mainly defined by macrophages and T cells, with distinct prognosis and associations with immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-1, CD274, CTLA-4, LAG-3 and IFNG. We found tumors with decreased number of M1 macrophages or increased regulatory T cells were associated with poor prognosis. Based on the multivariate Cox analysis, a nomogram was also established for clinical application. In conclusion, composition of the TIICs in HCC was quite different, which is an important determinant of prognosis with great potential to identify candidates for immunotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W3015138593,"Globally, there is a high economic burden caused by pre- and post–harvest losses in vegetables, fruits and ornamentals due to soft rot diseases. At present, the control methods for these diseases are limited, but there is some promise in developing biological control products for use in Integrated Pest Management. This study sought to formulate a phage cocktail which would be effective against soft rot Pectobacteriaceae species affecting potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), with potential methods of application in agricultural systems, including vacuum–infiltration and soil drench, also tested. Six bacteriophages were isolated and characterized using transmission electron microscopy, and tested against a range of Pectobacterium species that cause soft rot/blackleg of potato. Isolated bacteriophages of the family Podoviridae and Myoviridae were able to control isolates of the Pectobacterium species: Pectobacterium atrosepticum and Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum. Genomic analysis of three Podoviridae phages did not indicate host genes transcripts or proteins encoding toxin or antibiotic resistance genes. These bacteriophages were formulated as a phage cocktail and further experiments showed high activity in vitro and in vivo to suppress Pectobacterium growth, potentially indicating their efficacy in formulation as a microbial pest control agent to use in planta."
https://openalex.org/W3011906538,"Globally, one billion people live in informal settlements, and that number is expected to triple by 2050. Studies suggests that health in informal settlements is a serious and growing concern, yet there is a paucity of research focused on health outcomes and the correlates of health in these settlements. Studies cite individual, environmental and social correlates to health in informal settlements, but they often lack empirical evidence. In particular, research suggests that high rates of violence against women (VAW) in informal settlements may be associated with detrimental effects on women's health, but few studies have investigated this link. The purpose of this study was to fill this gap by empirically exploring associations between women's experiences of intimate partner violence (IPV) and their physical and mental health. Data for this study were collected in August 2018 in Mathare Valley Informal Settlement in Nairobi, Kenya. A total of 550 randomly-selected women participated in surveys; however, analyses for this study were run on a subpopulation of the women (n = 361). Multivariate logistic regressions were used to investigate the link between psychological, sexual, and emotional IPV and women's mental and physical health. Results suggest that while some socioeconomic, demographic, and environmental variables were significantly associated with women's mental and physical health outcomes, all types of IPV emerged key correlates in this context. In particular, women's experiences of IPV were associated with lower odds of normal-high physical health component scores (based on SF-36); higher odds of gynecological and reproductive health issues, psychological distress (based on K-10), depression, suicidality, and substance use. Findings from this study suggest that policies and interventions focused on prevention and response to VAW in informal settlements may make critical contributions to improving health for women in these rapidly growing settlements."
https://openalex.org/W3014655461,"Regulatory T cells (Treg) play essential roles in maintaining immune homeostasis. Resident Treg in visceral adipose tissue (VAT-Treg) decrease in male obese mice, which leads to the development of obesity-associated chronic inflammations and insulin resistance. Although gender differences in immune responses have been reported, the effects of the difference in metabolic environment on VAT-Treg are unclear. We investigated the localization of VAT-Treg in female mice in comparison with that in male mice. On a high-fat diet (HFD), VAT-Treg decreased in male mice but increased in female mice. The increase was abolished in ovariectomized and HFD-fed mice, but was restored by estrogen supplementation. The IL33 receptor ST2, which is important for the localization and maturation of VAT-Treg in males, was reduced in CD4+CD25+ T cells isolated from gonadal fat of obese mice of both genders, suggesting that a different system exists for VAT-Treg localization in females. Extensive analysis of chemokine expression in gonadal fat and adipose CD4+CD25+T cells revealed several chemokine signals related to female-specific VAT-Treg accumulation such as CCL24, CCR6, and CXCR3. Taken together, the current study demonstrated sexual dimorphism in VAT-Treg localization in obese mice. Estrogen may attenuate obesity-associated chronic inflammation partly through altering chemokine-related VAT-Treg localization in females."

The beneficiaries of this technology are primarily patients, but also students of medical faculties. Taking into account that not all students have full, direct access to the latest advances in additive technologies, we surveyed their opinion on 3D printing and education in this area. The research aimed to determine what knowledge about the use of 3D printing technology in medicine, do students of medical faculties have.The research was carried out in the form of a questionnaire among 430 students of the Medical University of Silesia in Katowice (Poland) representing various fields of medicine and health sciences. The questions included in the survey analyzed the knowledge of the respondents for 3D printing technology and the opportunities it creates in medicine.The results indicate that students do have knowledge about 3D printing obtained mainly from the internet. They would be happy to deepen their knowledge at specialized courses in this field. Students appreciated the value of 3D printing in order to obtain accurate anatomical models, helpful in learning. However, they do not consider the possibility of complete abandonment of human cadavers in the anatomy classes. Their knowledge includes basic information about current applications of 3D printing in medicine, but not in all areas. However, they have no ethical doubts regarding the use of 3D printing in any form. The vast majority of students deemed it necessary to incorporate information regarding 3D printing technology into the curriculum of different medical majors.This research is the first of its kind, which allows for probing students' knowledge about the additive technologies in medicine. Medical education should be extended to include issues related to the use of 3D printing for medical applications."
https://openalex.org/W3014777889,"Emergency department triage is the first point in time when a patient's acuity level is determined. The time to assign a priority at triage is short and it is vital to accurately stratify patients at this stage, since under-triage can lead to increased morbidity, mortality and costs. Our aim was to present a model that can assist healthcare professionals in triage decision making, namely in the stratification of patients through the risk prediction of a composite critical outcome-mortality and cardiopulmonary arrest. Our study cohort consisted of 235826 adult patients triaged at a Portuguese Emergency Department from 2012 to 2016. Patients were assigned to emergent, very urgent or urgent priorities of the Manchester Triage System (MTS). Demographics, clinical variables routinely collected at triage and the patients' chief complaint were used. Logistic regression, random forests and extreme gradient boosting were developed using all available variables. The term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) natural language processing weighting factor was applied to vectorize the chief complaint. Stratified random sampling was used to split the data into train (70%) and test (30%) data sets. Ten-fold cross validation was performed in train to optimize model hyper-parameters. The performance obtained with the best model was compared against the reference model-a regularized logistic regression trained using only triage priorities. Extreme gradient boosting exhibited good calibration properties and yielded areas under the receiver operating characteristic and precision-recall curves of 0.96 (95% CI 0.95-0.97) and 0.31 (95% CI 0.26-0.36), respectively. The predictors ranked with higher importance by this model were the Glasgow coma score, the patients' age, pulse oximetry and arrival mode. Compared to the reference, the extreme gradient boosting model using clinical variables and the chief complaint presented higher recall for patients assigned MTS-3 and can identify those who are at risk of the composite outcome."
https://openalex.org/W3014827184,"To test the repeatability and reproducibility of the topography module in posterior segment spectral domain optical coherence tomography with Revo NX (new device) and to compare keratometry values obtained by a Scheimpflug tomography (Galilei G6) and a swept source OCT (Casia 2).In this prospective study, healthy subjects with nonoperated eyes had their central corneal thickness (CCT), anterior and posterior K1/K2 corneal power measured with the new device. Two operators made 6 measurements on the new device to check intraobserver repeatability and reproducibility, and measurement on Casia 2 and Galilei G6. Bland-Altman plots were used to assess the agreement between the devices for each analyzed variable.94 eyes (94 patients) were studied. All devices produced significantly different mean CCT, the highest for Galilei 569.13±37.58 μm followed by Casia 545.00 ±36.15 μm and Revo 537.39±35.92 μm. The mean anterior K1 was 43.21 ± 1.37 for Casia 2 43.21 ± 1.55 for Revo NX and 43.19 ± 1.39 for Galilei G6, and the differences were insignificant p = 0.617. The posterior K1 for Revo NX was -5.77 ± 0.25 whereas for Casia 2 it was -5.98±0.22 and for Galilei G6-6.09±0.28 D p< 0.0001. The Revo NX showed intraclass correlation coefficient ranging from 0.975 for the posterior K2 surface, and 0.994 for anterior K1 and 0.998 for CCT.Revo NX is independent of the user and offers a high level of repeatability for the anterior and posterior cornea. The wide range of differences between the devices suggests they should not be used interchangeably."
https://openalex.org/W3014608243,"Reliability of data has become a major concern in the course of the reproducibility crisis. Especially when studying animal behavior, confounding factors such as novelty of the test apparatus can lead to a wide variability of data which may mask treatment effects and consequently lead to misinterpretation. Habituation to the test situation is a common practice to circumvent novelty induced increases in variance and to improve the reliability of the respective measurements. However, there is a lack of published empirical knowledge regarding reasonable habituation procedures and a method validation seems to be overdue. This study aimed at setting up a simple strategy to increase reliability of behavioral data measured in a familiar test apparatus. Therefore, exemplary data from mice tested in an Open Field (OF) arena were used to elucidate the potential of habituation and how reliability of measures can be confirmed by means of a repeatability analysis using the software R. On seven consecutive days, male C57BL/6J, BALB/cJ and 129S1/SvImJ mice were tested in an OF arena once daily and individual mouse behavior was recorded. A repeatability analysis was conducted with regard to repeated trials of habituation. Our data analysis revealed that monitoring animal behavior during habituation is important to determine when individual differences of the measurements are stable. Repeatability values from distance travelled and average activity increased over the habituation period, revealing that around 60% of the variance of the data can be explained by individual differences between mice. The first day of habituation was significantly different from the following 6 days. A three-day habituation period appeared to be sufficient in this study. Overall, these results emphasize the importance of habituation and in depth analysis of habituation data to define the correct starting point of the experiment for improving the reliability and reproducibility of experimental data."
https://openalex.org/W3015156863,"Cryopreservation is a method used for preserving living cells by cooling them to very low temperatures. Although cryopreservation methods for oocytes and embryos have been developed for use in reproductive medicine, there are no established methods yet for preserving cell aggregates (spheroids) in regenerative medicine. We have developed a bio-three-dimensional (3D) printer that can fabricate scaffold-free 3D constructs by loading spheroids onto a needle array. We fabricated several constructs such as blood vessels, liver, diaphragm, and a conduit for nerves by using this method. These constructs have the potential to be applied in patients. However, the process of fabricating tissue constructs (harvesting cells, expanding cells, making spheroids using cultured cells, printing constructs, and maturing constructs) is time-consuming. Therefore, cryopreservation methods for spheroids or constructs should be developed to increase the efficiency of this method for clinical use. Here, we developed a method for cryopreserving spheroids, which were then used to fabricate constructs. Fibroblast cell-based spheroids were cryopreserved in phosphate-buffered saline or cryopreservation solution at −80°C for 1 week. After thawing, spheroids in cryopreservation solution began to fuse on day 1. Cryopreserved spheroids were printed onto a needle array to fabricate a scaffold-free tubular construct using a bio-3D printer. After 7 days, the printed spheroids fused and formed scaffold-free constructs. We confirmed the viability of cells in the cryopreserved spheroids and fabricated tubular constructs. Our results indicate that spheroids can be cryopreserved and used to prepare scaffold-free constructs for clinical use."
https://openalex.org/W3014565076,"Global trade and climate change are responsible for a surge in foreign invasive species and emerging pests and pathogens across the world. Early detection and surveillance activities are essential to monitor the environment and prevent or mitigate future ecosystem impacts. Molecular diagnostics by DNA testing has become an integral part of this process. However, for environmental applications, there is a need for cost-effective and efficient point-of-use DNA testing to obtain accurate results from remote sites in real-time. This requires the development of simple and fast sample processing and DNA extraction, room-temperature stable reagents and a portable instrument. We developed a point-of-use real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction system using a crude buffer-based DNA extraction protocol and lyophilized, pre-made, reactions for on-site applications. We demonstrate the use of this approach with pathogens and pests covering a broad spectrum of known undesirable forest enemies: the fungi Sphaerulina musiva, Cronartium ribicola and Cronartium comandrae, the oomycete Phytophthora ramorum and the insect Lymantria dispar. We obtained positive DNA identification from a variety of different tissues, including infected leaves, pathogen spores, or insect legs and antenna. The assays were accurate and yielded no false positive nor negative. The shelf-life of the lyophilized reactions was confirmed after one year at room temperature. Finally, successful tests conducted with portable thermocyclers and disposable instruments demonstrate the suitability of the method, named in Situ Processing and Efficient Environmental Detection (iSPEED), for field testing. This kit fits in a backpack and can be carried to remote locations for accurate and rapid detection of pests and pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W3010083984,"Background Rotator cuff tears are a common cause of shoulder pain and can result in prolonged periods of pain, disability and absence from work. Rotator cuff repair surgery is increasingly used in an attempt to resolve symptoms but has failure rates of around 40%. There is a pressing need to improve the outcome of rotator cuff repairs. Patch augmentation increasingly being used within the NHS in an attempt to reduce repair failures. The aim of this survey was to determine current UK practice and opinion relating to the factors that influence choice of patch, current patient selection and willingness to assist with generation of improved evidence. Methods An online survey was sent to the surgeon members of the British Elbow and Shoulder Society (BESS). Questions covered respondent demographics, experience with patches, indications for patch augmentation and willingness to be involved in a randomised trial of patch augmented rotator cuff surgery. Results The response rate was 105/550 (19%). 58% of respondents had used a patch to augment rotator cuff surgery. 70% of patch users had undertaken an augmented repair within the last 6 months. A wide surgical experience in augmentation was reported (ranging 1 to 200 implants used). However, most surgeons reported low volume usage, with a median of 5 rotator cuff augmentation procedures performed. At least 10 different products had been used. Most of the patches used were constructed from human decellularised dermis tissue, although porcine derived and synthetic based patches had also been used. Only 3–5% stated they would undertake an augmented repair for small tears across ages, whereas 28–40% and 19–59% would do so for large or massive tears respectively. When assessing patient suitability, patient age seemed relevant only for those with large and massive tears. Half of the surgeons reported an interest in taking part in a randomised controlled trial (RCT) evaluating the role of patch augmentation for rotator cuff surgery, with a further 22% of respondent’s undecided. Conclusions A variety of patches have been used by surgeons to augment rotator cuff repair with a wide range of operator experience. There was substantial uncertainty about which patch to use and differing views on which patients were most suitable. There is a clear need for robust clinical evaluation and further research in this area."
https://openalex.org/W3014304344,"Cold stenothermal insects living in glacier-fed streams are stressed by temperature variations resulting from glacial retreat during global warming. The molecular aspects of insect response to environmental stresses remain largely unexplored. The aim of this study was to expand our knowledge of how a cold stenothermal organism controls gene expression at the transcriptional, translational, and protein level under warming conditions. Using the chironomid Diamesa tonsa as target species and a combination of RACE, qPCR, polysomal profiling, western blotting, and bioinformatics techniques, we discovered a new molecular pathway leading to previously overlooked adaptive strategies to stress. We obtained and characterized the complete cDNA sequences of three heat shock inducible 70 (hsp70) and two members of heat-shock cognate 70 (hsc70). Strikingly, we showed that a novel pseudo-hsp70 gene encoding a putative long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) which is transcribed during thermal stress, acting as a ribosome sponge to provide post-transcriptional control of HSP70 protein levels. The expression of the pseudo-hsp70 gene and its function suggest the existence of a new and unexpected mechanism to cope with thermal stress: lowering the pace of protein production to save energy and optimize resources for recovery."

To allow for better policy planning, we sought to examine the current status of managing rare diseases in Malaysia.This study was conducted in two phases. In the first phase, we triangulated information from reviews of journal publications, documents from the Malaysian government and in-depth interviews among selected key healthcare stakeholders in Malaysia. The second phase was designed as a cross-sectional survey to estimate the number of cases and treatment coverage for rare diseases in Malaysia.Malaysia has no official definition of rare disease yet but currently in the process of reviewing them for Malaysia. There are 13 rare disease specialists and a dozen medical doctors in genetic clinics around Malaysia, mainly in public health facilities. From the survey, 1,249 patients were diagnosed with rare diseases in public hospitals. Only 60% received their medications or supplements, and the rest continued with symptomatic treatment.Generally, Malaysia has made significant progress in the management of rare diseases, but there are still opportunities for development in critical areas. Ultimately, if all healthcare providers, government, society, and politicians work together to manage rare diseases, we will see an improvement in patient outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3014912319,"The research on core-periphery structure of global trade from a complex-network perspective has shown that the world system is hierarchically organized into blocks and that countries play different roles in the world economy. Yet, little attention has been paid to investigating whether the sectoral international trade networks conform to a core-periphery structure, hence what is the role of different levels of processing in creating and maintaining structural inequality. This issue is of particular importance given the contemporary focus upon global production networks and reshaping of the international division of labor. With this in mind, we propose a model (LARDEG) from network science to reexamine old theories in economics, such as core-periphery structures in sectoral international trade networks and test whether the global value chains have changed structural positions in terms of the level of processing. The economic background of our model permitting a more accurate sorting of countries into structural positions and the general stability of results have provided for a more solid measurements than has hereto been possible. Our algorithm naturally produces networks with hierarchically nested block structure obtained from an iterative decomposition of the network periphery such that each block represents a vertex set of a maximal size sub-graph existing at different levels. The results not only lend support to the previous hierarchical model of the world-system (core, semi-periphery, and periphery) but also find that, depending on particular industry, the number of analytically identifiable blocks could be more than three. We show that 'size effect' is the one that prevails for core block membership at the first hierarchical level, while the GNI per capita is a much poorer proxy for the world-system status. Moreover, the patterns of blocks we label as the second- or third-level 'core' are strongly dependent on distance and geographical proximity. Overall, the various configurations of asymmetrical trade patterns between our blocks and the remarkably stable position of core countries at the top of structure clearly indicate that the rise of global production networks has actually restored a huge and unequal international division of labor splitting the world into 'headquarter' and 'factory' economies."
https://openalex.org/W3014184582,"Zero-determinant (ZD) strategies, a recently found novel class of strategies in repeated games, has attracted much attention in evolutionary game theory. A ZD strategy unilaterally enforces a linear relation between average payoffs of players. Although existence and evolutional stability of ZD strategies have been studied in simple games, their mathematical properties have not been well-known yet. For example, what happens when more than one players employ ZD strategies have not been clarified. In this paper, we provide a general framework for investigating situations where more than one players employ ZD strategies in terms of linear algebra. First, we theoretically prove that a set of linear relations of average payoffs enforced by ZD strategies always has solutions, which implies that incompatible linear relations are impossible. Second, we prove that linear payoff relations are independent of each other under some conditions. These results hold for general games with public monitoring including perfect-monitoring games. Furthermore, we provide a simple example of a two-player game in which one player can simultaneously enforce two linear relations, that is, simultaneously control her and her opponent's average payoffs. All of these results elucidate general mathematical properties of ZD strategies."
https://openalex.org/W3014327760,"There has been a growing burden of anxiety among Nepalese adolescents. Social anxiety in particular is one of the commonly reported symptoms indicating mental health problem among adolescents. The purpose of this study was to assess social anxiety, and identify how social support, emotion regulation and mindfulness uniquely contribute to social anxiety among adolescents in Birgunj, Nepal. The study was conducted by using a self-administered questionnaire among 384 adolescents (65.4% boys; M = 16.05 years, SD = 1.39) studying at secondary schools of Birgunj. Results show that there was a positive correlation between social anxiety symptoms and age, and girls reported more symptoms. Traits such as non-acceptance of emotions, lack of clarity and lack of awareness of emotions were related to increased social anxiety; while acting with awareness, non-reactivity, and better ability to describe emotions was related to decreased social anxiety. Finally, more social support from close friends was related to lower social anxiety. These results suggest that improving emotion regulation, dispositional mindfulness, and social support may be helpful for adolescents who are at risk of, or are suffering from, social anxiety."
https://openalex.org/W3015172848,"Background Historically, liver allografts with >30% macrosteatosis (MaS) on donor biopsy have been associated with early allograft dysfunction and worse graft survival; however, successful outcomes have been reported in small cohorts. This study proposes an elevated MaS threshold for organ utilization without detriment to graft survival. Methods The UNOS Standard Transplant Analysis and Research database was evaluated for transplants between 2006–2015. Graft survival up to 1-year was evaluated by Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival analyses, and by univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses, including donor and recipient characteristics. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for risk of graft loss are reported. Results Thirty-day risk of graft loss was increased with MaS as low as 10–19% (OR [95% CI] 1.301 [1.055–1.605], p<0.0001) and peaked with MaS 50–59% (2.921 [1.672–5.103]). At 1-year, risk of graft loss remained elevated with MaS 40–49% (1.465 [1.002–2.142]) and MaS 50–59% (1.978 [1.281–3.056], p = 0.0224). Multivariable models were created for Lower and Higher MELD recipients and MaS cutoffs were established. In Lower MELD recipients, organs with ≥50% MaS had increased risk of graft loss at 30 days (2.451 [1.541–3.897], p = 0.0008) and 1-year post-transplant (1.720 [1.224–2.418], p = 0.0125). Higher MELD recipients had increased risk of graft loss at 30 days with allografts showing MaS ≥40% (4.204 [1.440–5.076], p = 0.0016). At 1-year the risk remained increased, but MaS was not significant predictor of graft loss.048 [1.131–3.710], p = 0.0616). In both MELD cohorts, organs with MaS levels below threshold had similar survival to those transplanted without a donor biopsy. Conclusions In conjunction with recipient selection, organs with MaS up to 50% may be safely used without detriment to outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3014549031,"Background Multiple approaches have been proposed to measure low socio-economic status. In France the concept of precariousness, akin to social deprivation, was developed and is widely used. EPICES is a short questionnaire that was developed to measure this concept. This study aimed to evaluate Differential Item Functioning (DIF) in the EPICES questionnaire between contrasted areas: mainland France, French West Indies (FWI) and French Guiana (FG). Methods The population was taken from the INDIA study, which aimed to evaluate the impact of social inequalities on stroke characteristics and prognosis. Eligible people were patients referred to neurology or emergency departments for a suspicion of stroke. We assessed the DIF using hybrid ordinal logistic regression method, derived from item response theory. Results We analysed 1 553 stroke patients, including 768 from FWI (49.5%), 289 from FG (18.6%) and 496 from mainland (31.9%). We identified five items with a moderate to large DIF in area comparisons: “meeting with a social worker”, “complementary health insurance”, “home-owning”, “financial difficulties” and “sport activities”. Correlation between EPICES score and the latent variable was strong (r = 0.84). Conclusion This is the first attempt to assess the DIF of the EPICES score between different French populations. We found several items with DIF, which can be explained by individual interpretation or local context. However, the DIFs did not lead to a large difference between the latent variable and the EPICES score, which indicates that it can be used to assess precariousness and social deprivation between contrasted areas."

The aim of this study was to determine if qPET could be applied as an alternative response method in adults in the RAPID trial. Methods PET-CT scans performed after 3 cycles of ABVD in RAPID were re-evaluated by an independent reader, blinded to PET results and outcome in RAPID. All initially involved regions were assessed visually and by qPET. The distribution of qPET measurements was compared for RAPID and C1 patients. Previously published qPET thresholds corresponding to visual DS (vDS) of 1–5 in C1 were used to derive quantitative DS (qDS) for RAPID patients. Results PET-CT scans were available for 450 patients from RAPID. vDS were 1 (171 scans), 2 (153 scans), 3 (72 scans), 4 (31 scans) and 5 (23 scans) respectively. The distribution of qPET values was similar to C1 patients, with a unimodal ‘normal’ distribution and a long tail to the right, suggestive of favorable response in the majority and less favorable response in the minority with outlying values. qPET thresholds from C1 applied in RAPID patients gave 86% concordance for vDS and qDS. There was 97% concordance for complete metabolic response (CMR; DS 1–3) vs. no-CMR using the Lugano classification. Conclusion qPET which was developed in pediatric patients receiving more intensive OEPA chemotherapy, was a suitable quantitative method for assessing response in adult patients treated with ABVD in a response-adapted setting in the RAPID trial."

Although situational stressors show a significant influence on burnout, their power to predict the complete syndrome is rather limited. After all, stressors only exist “in the eye of the beholder”. This study aimed to explore how individual vulnerability factors such as core-self evaluations and coping, contribute to burnout in relation to situational stressors within a population of hospital nurses. Cross-sectional data was collected in 2014, using five validated self-report instruments: Dutch Core Self Evaluations Scale, Nursing Work Index Revised, Utrecht Coping List, Ruminative Response Scale, and Utrecht Burnout Scale. 219 of the 250 questionnaires were returned. Core-self evaluations, situational factors and coping each contributed significantly to the predictive capacity of the models of the separate burnout dimensions. Core-self evaluations was significantly related to emotional exhaustion. It was suggested that Core-self evaluations might be placed at the initiation of the loss cycle. However, further research is warranted."

The As/Ps measured by the anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) and other indices measured by AS-OCT and rotating Scheimpflug-based corneal tomography were evaluated. The area under receiver-operating-characteristics (AU-ROC) was calculated to assess the diagnostic ability in discriminating FFKC from normal eyes.The As/Ps, the Belin/Ambrosio display enhanced ectasia total derivation value (BAD-D) and posterior and anterior elevation values showed the AU-ROC 0.9 or more in differentiating FFKC from normal eyes (0.980, 0.951, 0.924 and 0.903, respectively). The sensitivity and specificity were 0.92 and 0.96 for the As/Ps, 1.00 and 0.90 for BAD-D, 0.85 and 0.86 for posterior elevation value, and 0.85 and 0.96 for anterior elevation value, respectively.Among the several indices for keratoconus screening which we evaluated, the As/Ps obtained by AS-OCT had the large AU-ROC with high sensitivity and specificity in detecting FFKC, which was comparable with BAD-D obtained by rotating Scheimpflug-based corneal tomography. The As/Ps may provide information for improving the diagnostic accuracy of KC, even in the initial stage of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W3014410239,"The objective of this study was to characterize the demographic and clinical profile of RRMS patients receiving fingolimod in Spain, and to evaluate drug effectiveness and safety in clinical practice.This observational, retrospective, multicentre, nationwide study was performed at 56 Spanish hospitals and involved 804 RRMS patients who received oral fingolimod (0.5 mg) since November 2011, with a minimum follow-up of 12 months.The mean annualized relapse rate (ARR) in the year before fingolimod was 1.08 and the median EDSS was 3; patients were exposed to fingolimod for 2.2 years as average; regarding magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) activity, more than half of the patients had >20 lesions at baseline. Patients were previously treated with first-line injectable DMTs (60.3%), or natalizumab (31.3%), and 8.3% were naïve patients. Overall, the ARR significantly decreased to 0.28, 0.22 and 0.17 (74.1%, 79.7% and 83.5% of relative reduction, respectively) after 12, 24 and 36 months of treatment, P<0.001. The ARR of patients who switched from natalizumab to fingolimod was stable over the study. Most of the patients (88.7%) were free from confirmed disability and MRI activity (67.3%) after 24 months. The persistence after 12 months on fingolimod was 93.9%.The subgroups of patients analysed showed differential baseline demographic and clinical characteristics. The analysis of patients who received fingolimod in routine clinical practice confirmed adequate efficacy and safety, even for long-term treatment. The present data also confirmed the positive benefit/risk balance with fingolimod in real-world clinical practice setting."
https://openalex.org/W3014453309,"Oxidative stress is considered to be involved in the pathogenesis of primary blast-related traumatic brain injury (bTBI). We evaluated the effects of ascorbic acid 2-glucoside (AA2G), a well-known antioxidant, to control oxidative stress in rat brain exposed to laser-induced shock waves (LISWs). The design consisted of a controlled animal study using male 10-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats. The study was conducted at the University research laboratory. Low-impulse (54 Pa•s) LISWs were transcranially applied to rat brain. Rats were randomized to control group (anesthesia and head shaving, n = 10), LISW group (anesthesia, head shaving and LISW application, n = 10) or LISW + post AA2G group (AA2G administration after LISW application, n = 10) in the first study. In another study, rats were randomized to control group (n = 10), LISW group (n = 10) or LISW + pre and post AA2G group (AA2G administration before and after LISW application, n = 10). The measured outcomes were as follows: (i) motor function assessed by accelerating rotarod test; (ii) levels of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), an oxidative stress marker; (iii) ascorbic acid in each group of rats. Ascorbic acid levels were significantly decreased and 8-OHdG levels were significantly increased in the cerebellum of the LISW group. Motor coordination disorder was also observed in the group. Prophylactic AA2G administration significantly increased the ascorbic acid levels, reduced oxidative stress and mitigated the motor dysfunction. In contrast, the effects of therapeutic AA2G administration alone were limited. The results suggest that the prophylactic administration of ascorbic acid can reduce shock wave-related oxidative stress and prevented motor dysfunction in rats."
https://openalex.org/W3014824873,"Background and purpose: Excess insulin resistance is considered the predominant pathophysiological mechanism in obese women who develop gestational diabetes (GDM). We hypothesised that obese women requiring differing treatment modalities for GDM may have diverse underlying metabolic pathways. Methods: In this secondary analysis of the UK pregnancies Better Eating and Activity Trial (UPBEAT) we studied women from the control arm with complete biochemical data at three gestational time points; at 15–18+6 and 27–28+6 weeks (before treatment), and 34–36+0 weeks (after treatment). A total of 89 analytes were measured (plasma/serum) using a targeted nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) platform and conventional assays. We used linear regression with appropriate adjustment to model metabolite concentration, stratified by treatment group. Main findings: 300 women (median BMI 35kg/m2; inter quartile range 32.8–38.2) were studied. 71 developed GDM; 28 received dietary treatment only, 20 metformin, and 23 received insulin. Prior to the initiation of treatment, multiple metabolites differed (p<0.05) between the diet and insulin-treated groups, especially very large density lipoprotein (VLDL) and high density lipoprotein (HDL) subclasses and constituents, with some differences maintained at 34–36 weeks’ gestation despite treatment. Gestational lipid profiles of the diet treatment group were indicative of a lower insulin resistance profile, when compared to both insulin-treated women and those without GDM. At 28 weeks’ the diet treatment group had lower plasma fasting glucose and insulin than women treated with insulin, yet similar to those without GDM, consistent with a glycaemic mechanism independent of insulin resistance. Conclusions/Interpretation: This exploratory study suggests that GDM pathophysiological processes may differ amongst obese women who require different treatment modalities to achieve glucose control and can be revealed using metabolic profiling."
https://openalex.org/W3015101948,"The endophytic bacterial diversity of rose was analyzed by high-throughput sequencing of 16S rDNA and functional prediction of the bacterial community. The number of bacterial sequence reads obtained from 18 rose samples ranged from 63,951 to 114,833, and reads were allocated to 1982 OTUs based on sequences of the V3-V4 region. The highest Shannon Index was found in Luogang rose (1.93), while the lowest was found in Grasse rose (0.35). The bacterial sequence reads were grouped into three different phyla: Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria. At the genus level, Bacillus and Staphylococcus had the highest abundance across all 18 samples; Bacillus was particularly abundant in Daguo rose (99.09%), Rosa damascena (99.65%), and Fenghua rose (99.58%). Unclassified OTUs were also found in all samples. PICRUSt gene prediction revealed that each endophyte sample contained multiple KEGG functional modules related to human metabolism and health. A high abundance of functional genes were involved in (1) Amino Acid Metabolism, (2) Carbohydrate Metabolism, (3) Cellular Processes and Signaling, (4) Energy Metabolism, and (5) Membrane Transport, indicating that the endophytic community comprised a wide variety of microorganisms and genes that could be used for further studies. The rose endophytic bacterial community is rich in diversity; community composition varies among roses and contains functional information related to human health."
https://openalex.org/W3014690270,"Insomnia is a major comorbid symptom of chronic pain and is likely to affect caregiver burden. This cross-sectional study investigated the association between insomnia in chronic pain patients and family caregiver burden. Participants were 60 patients with chronic pain of ≥3 months duration. Demographic and clinical information were collected using the Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS), the Pain Disability Assessment Scale (PDAS), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and a pain intensity numerical rating scale (NRS). Family members who accompanied chronic pain patients to hospital completed the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI). Univariate regression analysis and multiple regression analysis were conducted to clarify the associations between ZBI scores and total/subscale AIS scores. Covariates were age; sex; pain duration; and scores on the PDAS, HADS anxiety subscale, HADS depression subscale, and NRS. Insomnia was independently associated with ZBI scores [β: 0.27, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.07–0.52, p = 0.001]. Scores on the AIS subscale of physical and mental functioning during the day were significantly associated with ZBI scores (β: 0.32, 95% CI: 0.05–0.59, p = 0.007). In conclusion, the findings suggest that in chronic pain patients, comorbid insomnia and physical and mental daytime functioning is associated with family caregiver burden independently of pain duration, pain-related disability, and pain intensity."

Pharmacologic options are not universally effective and side effects are common. Objective data regarding non-pharmacologic treatment is limited. The study objective was to evaluate the efficacy of the MMF07 foot massager and heat therapy on the severity of RLS symptoms.In this pilot randomized controlled trial, twenty-eight patients with diagnosed, bothersome RLS were randomized to four treatment arms: no active intervention (n = 7), foot massager (n = 8), heat therapy (n = 6), and foot massager plus heat therapy (n = 7). Participants completed the RLS Severity Scale, RLS Quality of Life questionnaire, and the Medical Outcomes Study Sleep scale at the baseline visit and at the 4-week follow up visit.Four weeks post randomization, participants in the massager group had significant improvement in the RLS severity score (average difference: -9.0, 95% CI: -16.3, -1.7, p = 0.017) and sleep scale (average difference: -22.0, 95% CI: -36.5, -7.5, p = 0.005) compared to the no intervention group. The heat alone group had a significant improvement in the sleep scale compared to the no-intervention group (average difference: -17.4, 95% CI: -32.5, -2.3, p = 0.026). Quality of life improved in the massage only group compared to control (average difference 25.3, 95% CI: -2.4, 53.0, p = 0.072).Results suggest that the MMF07 foot massage device and heat therapy may be feasible and effective treatment options to improve RSL symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W3014640995,"Acute heat shock has previously been shown to improve subsequent low O2 (hypoxia) tolerance in an intertidal fish species, a process known as cross-tolerance, but it is not known whether this is a widespread phenomenon. This study examined whether a rock pool specialist, the triplefin fish Bellapiscis medius, exhibits heat shock induced cross-tolerance to hypoxia, i.e., longer time to loss of equilibrium (LOE) and lower critical O2 saturation (Scrit) after recovering from an acute heat challenge. Non-heat shock controls had a median time to loss of equilibrium (LOE50) of 54.4 min under severe hypoxia (7% of air saturation) and a Scrit of 15.8% air saturation. Contrary to expectations, however, treatments that received an 8 or 10°C heat shock showed a significantly shorter LOE50 in hypoxia (+8°C = 41.5 min; +10°C = 28.7 min) and no significant change in Scrit (+8°C = 17.0% air saturation; +10°C = 18.3% of air saturation). Thus, there was no evidence of heat shock induced cross-tolerance to hypoxia in B. medius because exposure to acute heat shock impaired hypoxia tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W3014692089,"China has the largest share of global iron and steel production, which is considered to play a significant contribution to air pollution. This study aims to investigate trace element contamination at different fractions of particulate matter (PM) at industrial areas in China. Three PM fractions, PM2.1-9.0, PM1.1-2.1 and PM1.1, were collected from areas surrounding iron and steelmaking plants at Kunming, Wuhan, Nanjing and Ningbo in China. Multiple trace elements and their bioavailability, as well as Pb isotopic compositions, were analysed for identification of contaminants, health risk assessment and source apportionment. Results showed that PM particles in the sites near industrial areas were associated with a range of toxic trace elements, specifically As, Cr(VI), Cd and Mn, and posed significant health risks to humans. The isotopic Pb compositions identified that coal and high temperature metallurgical processes in the steelmaking process were the dominant contributors to local air pollution in these sites. In addition to iron and steelmaking activities, traffic emissions and remote pollution also played a contributing role in PM contamination, confirmed by the differences of Pb isotopic compositions at each PM fraction and statistical results from Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluations (PROMETHEE) and Geometrical Analysis for Interactive Aid (GAIA). The results presented in this study provide a comprehensive understanding of PM emissions at iron and steelmaking areas, which helps to guide subsequent updates of air pollution control guidelines to efficiently minimise environmental footprint and ensure long term sustainability of the industries."
https://openalex.org/W3014363591,"Though elevated ferritin level and decreased lung function both predispose people to cardio-metabolic disease, few reports have investigated the association between them. Furthermore, it remains unclear whether the association reflects a change in iron stores or an epiphenomenon reflecting metabolic stress. Therefore, we looked for possible associations between ferritin, iron, and transferrin saturation (TSAT) and lung function to clarify the role of iron-related parameters in healthy men.We conducted a cohort study of 42,927 healthy Korean men (mean age: 38.6 years). Percent predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1%) and forced vital capacity (FVC%) were categorized into quartiles. Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (using the highest quartile as reference) were calculated for hyperferritinemia, high iron, and high TSAT after controlling for potential confounders.The median ferritin level was 199.8 (141.5-275.6) ng/mL. The prevalence of hyperferritinemia (defined as >300 ng/mL) was 19.3%. Subjects with hyperferritinemia had lower FEV1% and FVC% than those with normal ferritin level with a slight difference, but those were statistically significant (99.22% vs.99.61% for FEV1%, p = 0.015 and 98.43% vs. 98.87% for FVC, p = 0.001). However, FEV1/FVC ratio was not significantly different between groups (P = 0.797). Compared with the highest quartile, the aORs for hyperferritinemia across decreasing quartiles were 1.081 (1.005-1.163), 1.100 (1.007-1.200), and 1.140 (1.053-1.233) for FEV1% (p for trend = 0.007) and 1.094 (1.018-1.176), 1.101 (1.021-1.188), and 1.150 (1.056-1.252) for FVC% (p for trend = 0.001). However, neither FEV1% nor FVC% was associated with iron or TSAT.Hyperferritinemia was associated with decreased lung function in healthy Korean men, but iron and TSAT were not. Longitudinal follow-up studies are required to validate our findings."

Participants completed face-to-face interviewer-administered questionnaire surveys and were tested for HIV.A total of 710 MSM participants were recruited, of whom 36.1% were from rural areas. The overall HIV prevalence was 16.6%, and was considerably lower among MSM living in rural areas (3.9%) than those living in urban areas (24.2%). 61.1% participants had not condom use with male sexual behavior in the past 6 months (86.7% in rural areas and 46.7% in urban areas). The social demographic and behavioral characteristics had significance difference among rural and urban MSM. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that, compared to men living in urban areas, MSM living in rural areas MSM were more likely to use dating apps to find sexual partners, were more likely to engage in bisexual behavior, and had lower condom use. 43.0% participants had been tested for HIV in the past year (41.8% in rural areas and 43.6% in urban areas). Multivariate logistic regression also revealed that among participants living in rural areas, having rural health insurance and not accepting HIV intervention were associated with lower HIV testing rates, while a higher monthly income and through use of internet to find sexual partner were associated with higher rates of HIV testing.High risk behavior was prevalent, and HIV testing rates were low among MSM living in rural areas compare to urban areas in Zhejiang Province, therefore, preventative intervention measures should be immediately among rural MSM urgently to reduce HIV transmission and to promote HIV testing."
https://openalex.org/W3014222361,"Vaccinia virus (VACV) has been used extensively as the vaccine against smallpox and as a viral vector for the development of recombinant vaccines and cancer therapies. Replication-competent, non-attenuated VACVs induce strong, long-lived humoral and cell-mediated immune responses and can be effective oncolytic vectors. However, complications from uncontrolled VACV replication in vaccinees and their close contacts can be severe, particularly in individuals with predisposing conditions. In an effort to develop replication-competent VACV vectors with improved safety, we placed VACV late genes encoding core or virion morphogenesis proteins under the control of tet operon elements to regulate their expression with tetracycline antibiotics. These replication-inducible VACVs would only express the selected genes in the presence of tetracyclines. VACVs inducibly expressing the A3L or A6L genes replicated indistinguishably from wild-type VACV in the presence of tetracyclines, whereas there was no evidence of replication in the absence of antibiotics. These outcomes were reflected in mice, where the VACV inducibly expressing the A6L gene caused weight loss and mortality equivalent to wild-type VACV in the presence of tetracyclines. In the absence of tetracyclines, mice were protected from weight loss and mortality, and viral replication was not detected. These findings indicate that replication-inducible VACVs based on the conditional expression of the A3L or A6L genes can be used for the development of safer, next-generation live VACV vectors and vaccines. The design allows for administration of replication-inducible VACV in the absence of tetracyclines (as a replication-defective vector) or in the presence of tetracyclines (as a replication-competent vector) with enhanced safety."
https://openalex.org/W3014339851,"The average length of hospital stay in the psychiatric ward is longer, and the risk of patient-to-nurse violence is higher than that in other departments. Therefore, psychiatric nurses' work environment may differ from that of other nurses. The factors related to psychiatric nurses' self-efficacy may also differ from those of general workers or other nurses. Mental health care that considers the characteristics of psychiatric nurses requires exploration of self-efficacy unique to psychiatric nurses. This cross-sectional study aimed to explore the distinct factors related to psychiatric nurses' self-efficacy. The developed 24 items related to improvement in self-efficacy and 25 items related to decrease in self-efficacy were examined. The Generalized Self-Efficacy Scale was used to measure the validity of the factors. To extract the factors of self-efficacy, data from 132 nurses and assistant nurses who provided informed consent were analyzed, and the reliability and validity of the factors were calculated. The factors associated with improvement in self-efficacy were ""Positive reactions by patients,"" ""Ability to positively change nurse-patient relationship,"" and ""Practicability of appropriate nursing."" The factors associated with decrease in self-efficacy were ""Uncertainty in psychiatric nursing"" and ""Nurses' role loss."" The Cronbach's α for all factors exceeded .70. Of the five factors, four had significant weak-to-moderate correlations with the Japanese version of the Generalized Self-Efficacy Scale; therefore, the validity was quantitatively confirmed with four factors. Interventions based on these four factors may improve psychiatric nurses' self-efficacy. Additionally, it is possible that this tool assesses the unique facets of self-efficacy rather than psychiatric nurses' general self-efficacy. Interventions to improve psychiatric nurses' self-efficacy based on the characteristics of psychiatry are needed."
https://openalex.org/W3014614208,"California's coastal climate is characterized by rainy winters followed by a dry summer season that is supplemented by frequent fog. While rising temperatures and drought caused massive tree mortality in central California during the 2011–2015 extreme drought, dying trees were less common in the central coast region. We hypothesized that cooler, maritime-ameliorated temperatures reduced the effects of drought stress on coastal vegetation. To test this, weekly measurements of water potential and stomatal conductance were made on two coast evergreen tree species, Arbutus menziesii and Quercus agrifolia, throughout the summer 2014 dry season. Water potential remained generally constant during this period but stomatal conductance declined in both species as the dry season progressed. Species' resistance to embolism was determined using the centrifuge method, and showed Q. agrifolia to be more vulnerable to embolism than A. menziesii. The stem vulnerability curves were consistent with species' seasonal water relations as well as their anatomy; the ring-porous Q. agrifolia had substantially larger conduits than the diffuse-porous A. menziesii. Leaf turgor loss points differed significantly as did other pressure-volume parameters but these data were consistent with the trees' seasonal water relations. Overall, the two species appear to employ differing water use strategies; A. menziesii is more profligate in its water use, while Q. agrifolia is more conservative, with a narrower safety margin against drought-induced loss of xylem transport capacity. Despite the extended drought, these species exhibited neither branch die-back nor any obvious symptoms of pronounced water-stress during the study period, implying that the maritime climate of California's central coast may buffer the local vegetation against the severe effects of prolonged drought."

Emergency medical services are a critical component of India's public health infrastructure; however, literature on the prehospital care of pediatric patients in low- and middle-income countries is minimal. The aim of this study is to describe the demographic and clinical characteristics associated with 30-day mortality among a cohort of pediatric patients transported via ambulance in India with an acute respiratory complaint.Pediatric patients less than 18 years of age using ambulance services in one of seven states in India, with a chief complaint of ""shortness of breath"", or a ""fever"" with associated ""difficulty breathing"" or ""cough"", were enrolled prospectively. Patients were excluded if evidence of choking, trauma or fire-related injury, patient was absent on ambulance arrival, or refused transport. Primary exposures included demographic, environmental, and clinical indicators, including hypoxemia and respiratory distress. The primary outcome was 7 and 30-day mortality. Multivariable logistic regression, stratified by transport type, was constructed to estimate associations between demographic and clinical predictors of mortality.A total of 1443 patients were enrolled during the study period: 981 (68.5%) were transported from the field, and 452 (31.5%) were interfacility transports. Thirty-day response was 83.4% (N = 1222). The median age of all patients was 2 years (IQR: 0.17-10); 93.9% (N = 1347) of patients lived on family incomes below the poverty level; and 54.1% (N = 706) were male. Cumulative mortality at 2, 7, and 30-days was 5.2%, 7.1%, and 7.7%, respectively; with 94 deaths by 30 days. Thirty-day mortality was greatest among those 0-28 days (N = 38,17%); under-5 mortality was 9.8%. In multivariable modeling prehospital oxygen saturation <95% (OR: 3.18 CI: 1.77-5.71) and respiratory distress (OR: 3.72 CI: 2.17-6.36) were the strongest predictors of mortality at 30 days.This is the first study to detail prehospital predictors of death among pediatric patients with shortness of breath in LMICs. The risk of death is particularly high among neonates and those with documented mild hypoxemia, or respiratory distress. Early recognition of critically ill children, targeted prehospital interventions, and diversion to higher level of care may help to mitigate the mortality burden in this population."
https://openalex.org/W3015056269,"We investigate the collective behavior of a globalized society under the influence of endogenous mass media trends. The mass media trend is a global field corresponding to the statistical mode of the states of the agents in the system. The interaction dynamics is based on Axelrod’s rules for the dissemination of culture. We find situations where the largest minority group, possessing a cultural state different from that of the predominant trend transmitted by the mass media, can grow to almost half of the size of the population. We show that this phenomenon occurs when a critical number of long-range connections are present in the underlying network of interactions. We have numerically characterized four phases on the space of parameters of the system: an ordered phase; a semi-ordered phase where almost half of the population consists of the largest minority in a state different from that of the mass media; a disordered phase; and a chimera-like phase where one large domain coexists with many very small domains."
https://openalex.org/W3015066646,"Pericellular and extracellular proteoglycans play an important role in modulating morphogen gradients and signal transductions. Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4 (Cspg4) is a membrane spanning proteoglycan expressed in immature progenitor cells and cancer cells. Cspg4 participates in cellular events such as proliferation, migration and signal transduction, and these events are generally important for embryo development. In this study, we characterized Cspg4 for its roles in zebrafish embryonic development. Our results demonstrated that cspg4 was maternally expressed from 0 to 3 hours post fertilization (hpf) and expressed in the anterior and posterior embryo end after 9 hpf. Knocking-down cspg4 resulted in a shorter anterior-posterior axis than control embryo, which could be rescued by co-injecting wnt11 mRNA suggesting that Cspg4 regulates body axis organization through modulating the Wnt/planar cell polarity signaling pathway. In addition, overexpressing cspg4 caused cyclopia. The Cspg4 transmembrane domain mutant embryo phenocopied the global over-expression of cspg4 mRNA and led to cyclopia with a very low penetrance. Our results demonstrated that the quantitatively and spatially accurate distribution of Cspg4 is critical for body axis and midline development during gastrulation."

Significant investment has been made in laparoscopic simulation, which has been shown to foster skill development prior to patient encounters. However, research suggests variable voluntary use of these resources by residents, and little is known about the motivational factors that influence their utilization. The purpose of this study was to characterize factors that motivate residents to seek laparoscopic simulation experience outside of the formal curriculum.We developed a questionnaire grounded in Expectancy Value Theory, an established psychological theory of motivation, by adapting validated measures to fit the study context. We conducted a cross sectional survey of Canadian obstetrics and gynecology residents.We invited residents enrolled in English-language obstetrics and gynecology training programs in Canada to participate.All residents engaged in clinical duties during Winter 2018 were invited to complete the questionnaire. Forty-four Obstetrics and Gynecology (Ob/Gyn) residents participated in the study.Residents reported limited use of simulation resources and identified multiple barriers including lack of time, access, and supervision. They expressed concern about development of bad habits during independent practice, and simulation use was positively correlated with perceived utility. Compared to junior residents, senior residents reported greater enjoyment of laparoscopic surgery, less emotional costs, and higher self-efficacy for learning laparoscopy.Residents' perception of utility and barriers impede voluntary simulation use and overall use was limited. As programs undertake curricula redevelopment for CBME, mitigating barriers and improving perceived utility of laparoscopic simulation is vital to increase use and enhance skill development."
https://openalex.org/W3014352761,"Background Patients with metastatic lung cancer can have severe cancer-related symptoms and treatment-induced side effects. Exercise is beneficial for patients with metastatic lung cancer; however, little information is available on guiding patients how to perform exercise during hospitalization. The purpose of this qualitative study was to understand exercise experiences in patients with metastatic lung cancer. Methods Patients with metastatic lung cancer (n = 24) participated in face-to-face in-depth interviews at an inpatient ward of a medical center in central Taiwan. Interview transcripts were evaluated using narrative analysis to extract and validate themes. Results Three primary themes were identified: (1) modifying exercise to maximize physical functions; (2) living with symptoms and frustration, but still exercising; and (3) doing exercise to sustain hopes, inner power, and life. Secondary findings included: (1) adopting walking as their main form of exercise because of its convenience; and (2) among patients with severe symptoms, adjusting exercise towards shorter time durations and shorter distances, slower speeds, and higher frequencies. Conclusions The study found physically active lung cancer patients, although with metastatic condition, adjusted their exercise activities to balance disease and treatment-induced deteriorations and boost themselves to feel hope and fight for cancer. However, the results may not be applicable to physically inactive patients. Future research to explore experiences from those with even worse physical conditions and further helping them to take some mild exercise to enhance the positive side of cancer experiences are suggested."

Previous research suggests facilitating greater autonomy for schools to select interventions aligned to their needs could improve implementation and maintenance. The aim of this mixed-methods outcome and process evaluation was to explore whether involving headteachers in the developmental stages of health interventions influenced adoption, effectiveness (e.g. pupil fitness and physical activity, assessed quantitatively), implementation and maintenance (assessed quantitatively and qualitatively). Three UK primary schools were provided with a choice of five evidence-based physical activity interventions: Playground scrapstore, daily classroom refreshers, alternative afterschool clubs, parent and child afterschool activities and an 'In the Zone' playground intervention. To evaluate the impact of this autonomous approach, semi-structured interviews with headteachers (n = 3), teachers (n = 3), and a private coach, and focus groups with pupils aged 9-11 (n = 6, 31 pupils, 15 boys), were undertaken. This was alongside an outcome and process evaluation, guided by the RE-AIM framework. This study assessed the impacts on adoption, implementation and maintenance of the autonomous approach and the effect on physical activity (seven day accelerometry-GENEActiv) and aerobic fitness (20m shuttle run). All three schools adopted different intervention components; alternative afterschool clubs, parent and child afterschool activities and daily classroom refreshers. Headteachers welcomed greater autonomy in developing school-based interventions and appreciated the more collaborative approach. Mixed results were reported for the effectiveness, implementation and maintenance of the interventions adopted. Allowing pupils choice and promoting a positive school environment were key factors for enhancing engagement. Moreover, promoting inclusive physical activity projects with a consideration of existing curriculum pressures aided implementation. This mixed-methods study provides valuable insights about autonomous approaches to inform further development, implementation and maintenance for future interventions."
https://openalex.org/W3014535156,"The nucleotide sequences of plasmids pRC12 (12,342 bp; GC 43.99%) and pRC18 (18,664 bp; GC 34.33%), harbored by the bacteriocin-producer Lactobacillus curvatus CRL 705, were determined and analyzed. Plasmids pRC12 and pRC18 share a region with high DNA identity (> 83% identity between RepA, a Type II toxin-antitoxin system and a tyrosine integrase genes) and are stably maintained in their natural host L. curvatus CRL 705. Both plasmids are low copy number and belong to the theta-type replicating group. While pRC12 is a pUCL287-like plasmid that possesses iterons and the repA and repB genes for replication, pRC18 harbors a 168 amino acid replication protein affiliated to RepB, which was named RepB'. Plasmid pRC18 also possesses a pUCL287-like repA gene but it was disrupted by an 11 kb insertion element that contains RepB', several transposases/IS elements, and the lactocin Lac705 operon. An Escherichia coli / Lactobacillus shuttle vector, named plasmid p3B1, carrying the pRC18 replicon (i.e. repB' and replication origin), a chloramphenicol resistance gene and a pBluescript backbone, was constructed and used to define the host range of RepB'. Chloramphenicol-resistant transformants were obtained after electroporation of Lactobacillus plantarum CRL 691, Lactobacillus sakei 23K and a plasmid-cured derivative of L. curvatus CRL 705, but not of L. curvatus DSM 20019 or Lactococcus lactis NZ9000. Depending on the host, transformation efficiency ranged from 102 to 107 per μg of DNA; in the new hosts, the plasmid was relatively stable as 29-53% of recombinants kept it after cell growth for 100 generations in the absence of selective pressure. Plasmid p3B1 could therefore be used for cloning and functional studies in several Lactobacillus species."
https://openalex.org/W3014913626,"Purpose To evaluate the real-world diagnostic performance of high-resolution susceptibility-weighted imaging (HR-SWI) and investigate whether the reader’s predictions can be used to find cases where HR-SWI finding and final clinical diagnosis matched. Methods This retrospective study enrolled patients with suspected Parkinsonism (n = 48) or volunteers with other intracranial pathologies (n = 31) who underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including HR-SWI, which was used to evaluate nigrosome 1 (NG1). All patients with suspected Parkinsonism underwent N-3-fluoropropyl-2-carbomethoxy-3-4-iodophenyl nortropane (FP-CIT) positron emission tomography and a clinical diagnosis was made by a neurologist. The HR-SWI data were qualitatively analyzed by two independent reviewers. A consensus reading was performed and a diagnostic confidence score was assigned. According to final clinical diagnosis, diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were calculated. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to examine whether the diagnostic confidence score could be used to identify HR-SWI finding—final clinical diagnosis matched cases. Results Of the 48 patients with suspected Parkinsonism, 31 were diagnosed with idiopathic Parkinson’s disease, and three with multiple system atrophy. The remaining 14 patients were included in the disease control group. Of the 31 volunteers, 10 subjects were excluded due to possibility of nigrostriatal degeneration and finally 21 subjects were enrolled as controls with non-Parkinsonism pathology (non-PD control). After consensus reading, 25 subjects were classified as true positive and 28 as true negative, according to HR-SWI findings. The calculated diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 73.5%, 80.0%, and 76.8%, respectively. With using diagnostic concordance score, the area under the ROC curve for the detection of concordance case was 0.83 (95% CI: 0.72–0.91, p < 0.05). Conclusion The diagnostic performance of NG1 detection using HR-SWI with 3T MRI was within acceptable range. Using the reader's diagnostic confidence could be helpful to find cases which HR-SWI finding and final clinical conclusion match. So HR-SWI may be of added value in the evaluation of suspected Parkinsonism."
https://openalex.org/W3014150605,"The number of elements in two stereo-surfaces parallelly overlapped in depth is overestimated compared to that in a single flat surface, even when both have the same number of elements. Using stereoscopic pairs of elements, we evaluated two hypotheses on the overestimation: one that a higher-order process, forming a background surface, increases the number of perceived elements, and the other that the number of elements potentially occluded by the elements on a front surface is taken accounted for. The data from four experiments showed that (a) when binocular disparity between (or among) stereoscopic elements was small, the overestimation occurred for the stimuli we used—a two-surface-overlapping stimulus, where the likelihood for the process to operate was manipulated by changing the averaged luminance of each surface, a volumetric stimulus, where the likelihood for the background surface to be formed would decrease, and a two-non-overlapping-surface stimulus, where the surfaces in depth were not overlapped—, and (b) when binocular disparity was large, the overestimation occurred for the two-surfaces-overlapping stimulus, when the averaged luminance of the two surfaces were the same, and for the volumetric stimulus, but diminished for the surface-overlapping stimulus, when the averaged luminance differed between the surfaces and for the surfaces-non-overlapping stimulus. These results cannot be explained either hypothesis only. We explain the results by postulating that the sensory system processing disparities of elements interferes with that estimating the number of elements, resulting in an overestimation of the elements in a stereo-stimulus, and the disparity range within which the interference occurs may depend on the stimulus depth structure."
https://openalex.org/W3014307902,"Acinetobacter baumannii is an opportunistic pathogen of intensive care unit (ICU) patients. A. baumannii colonizes many parts of the body including the gastrointestinal tract. Endemic and epidemic strains are polyclonal. There is no clarity on the origin of polyclonality of A. baumannii. The objective of the study was to define the genetic relatedness of serial isolates and the origin of polyclonality. Serial rectal isolates from ICU patients whose rectum was colonized on ≥5 sampling occasions were selected. From a total of 32 eligible colonized patients, isolates from a subgroup of 13 patients (a total of 108 isolates) showing different patterns of colonization as revealed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) were studied. The isolates were analyzed by PFGE pulsotypes, sequence types (STs) by multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) and clonal complex (CC) by eBURST analysis. Serial isolates constituted a mixture of identical, related and unrelated pulsotypes. Analysis by STs and CCs were less discriminatory. The data suggest a combination of an initial colonizing isolate undergoing mutation as well as colonization by independent isolates. Further clarity on the origin of diversity should be better obtained by whole-genome sequencing."
https://openalex.org/W3014794909,"The international public health (PH) community is debating the opportunity to incorporate genomic technologies into PH practice. A survey was conducted to assess attitudes of the European Public Health Association (EUPHA) members towards their role in the implementation of public health genomics (PHG), and their knowledge and attitudes towards genetic testing and the delivery of genetic services.EUPHA members were invited via monthly newsletter and e-mail to take part in an online survey from February 2017 to January 2018. A descriptive analysis of knowledge and attitudes was conducted, along with a univariate and multivariate analysis of their determinants.Five hundred and two people completed the questionnaire, 17.9% were involved in PHG activities. Only 28.9% correctly identified all medical conditions for which there is (or not) evidence for implementing genetic testing; over 60% thought that investing in genomics may divert economic resources from social and environmental determinants of health. The majority agreed that PH professionals may play different roles in incorporating genomics into their activities. Better knowledge was associated with positive attitudes towards the use of genetic testing and the delivery of genetic services in PH (OR = 1.48; 95% CI 1.01-2.18).Our study revealed quite positive attitudes, but also a need to increase awareness on genomics among European PH professionals. Those directly involved in PHG activities tend to have a more positive attitude and better knowledge; however, gaps are also evident in this group, suggesting the need to harmonize practice and encourage greater exchange of knowledge among professionals."
https://openalex.org/W3014927835,"Aim We aimed to assess the association between postpartum weight retention (PPWR) in the fourth week after delivery and the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in a subsequent pregnancy. Methods We performed a retrospective cohort study of the obstetric records of women who gave birth to their second singleton between 32 and 41 weeks of gestation at the National Hospital Organization Kofu National Hospital between January 2013 and September 2019. The exclusion criteria were missing data, twin pregnancy, diabetes in pregnancy, and delivery before 22 weeks in the first pregnancy. We calculated PPWR as the BMI 4 weeks after the first birth minus the BMI before the first pregnancy and grouped the subjects into the stable PPWR (gain of <1 BMI unit) and non-stable PPWR groups (gain of ≥1 BMI units). We used the χ2 test and multivariable logistic regression analysis to investigate the association between weight retention at the postpartum checkup and GDM. Results We included 566 women in this study (mean age, 31.7±4.8 years; mean maternal pre-pregnancy BMI, 21.3±3.5 kg/m2; term delivery, n = 544 [96.1%]). The overall prevalence of GDM during the second pregnancy was 7.4% (42/566), and 33.9% (192/566) of women had stable PPWR. Non-stable PPWR was not significantly associated with GDM in the second pregnancy (adjusted odds ratio, 1.93; 95% confidence interval, 0.84–4.46) after controlling for each variable. Conclusion PPWR measured in the fourth week after delivery was not associated with an increased risk of GDM in the second pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W3014789959,"Approximately one-third of the global stillbirth burden occurs during intrapartum period. The ability to assess obstetric parameters including effacement, dilatation, uterine contraction, decent, rupture of the uterus, and moulding of the foetal head are among the essential competencies required by obstetric service providers admitting women for labour in health facilities. Misdiagnosis of these conditions could result in unnecessary obstetric interventions and unfavourable obstetric outcomes including intrapartum stillbirth. This study aimed to assess associations between missed diagnosis plus complication of labour on admission and intrapartum stillbirth.A case-control study using primary data from chart review of medical records of women who experienced intrapartum stillbirth in 20 public health centres and three public hospitals of Addis Ababa between 01 July 2010 and 30 June 2015 was conducted. Data were collected from charts of all cases meeting the inclusion criteria. Medical records of women with livebirths were randomly selected and reviewed from each public health facilities in two to one (2:1) control to case ratio. Accordingly, 728 cases of stillbirth out of 1,056 charts met the inclusion criteria whereas 1,551 controls out of 1,705 were also considered in the study.Proportionally, more women in the stillbirth group (39.4%) than in the livebirth group (30.2%) experienced ruptured membrane on admission, with the difference being statistically significant (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.37-2.03). Significantly higher proportion of women in the intrapartum stillbirth group experienced FRH lower than 110/min, a result suggestive of foetal distress on admission. Proportionally, more women in the intrapartum stillbirth group (14.5%) than in the livebirth group (4.5%) had breech foetal presentation on admission for labour, the difference being statistically significant (aOR 3.26 95% CI 1.93-5.50). Intrapartum stillbirth was slightly higher among women with cervical dilatation 4cm or more on admission (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.00-1.45). This could be owing to delay in seeking obstetric care or misdiagnosis of the condition, a situation that seeks more rigorous study to determine the underlying causal links. Diagnosis of foetal member was missed among more cases than controls where the difference was statistically significant (aOR 1.51, CI 1.03-2.19).Low FHR, non-vertex foetal presentations and ruptured cervical membrane were predictors of intrapartum stillbirth. Health facilities could avert unnecessary foetal loss by undertaking timely actions to manage obstetric emergencies on admission to labour."
