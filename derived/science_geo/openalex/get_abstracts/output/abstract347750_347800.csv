https://openalex.org/W2045852899,"Akt is a protein serine/threonine kinase that is involved in the regulation of diverse cellular processes. Phosphorylation of Akt at regulatory residues Thr-308 and Ser-473 leads to its full activation. The protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) has long been known to negatively regulate Akt activity. The PP2A holoenzyme consists of the structural subunit (A), catalytic subunit (C), and a variable regulatory subunit (B). Here we report the identification of the specific B regulatory subunit that targets the PP2A holoenzyme to Akt. We found endogenous association of PP2A AB55C holoenzymes with Akt by co-immunoprecipitation analyses in pro-lymphoid FL5.12 cells. Akt was shown to associate with ectopically expressed B55α subunit in NIH3T3 cells. The direct interaction between B55α subunit and Akt was confirmed using in vitro pulldown analyses. Intriguingly, we found that overexpression of B55α subunit significantly impaired phosphorylation at Thr-308, but to a lesser extent at Ser-473 of Akt in both FL5.12 and NIH3T3 cells. Concomitantly, phosphorylation of a subset of Akt substrates, including FoxO3a, was substantially decreased by B55α overexpression in these cells. Silencing of B55α expression markedly increased phosphorylation at Thr-308 but not at Ser-473 in both FL5.12 cells and NIH3T3 cells. Consistently, PP2A AB55αC holoenzymes preferentially dephosphorylated phospho-Thr-308 rather than phospho-Ser-473 in in vitro dephosphorylation assays. Furthermore, B55α overexpression retarded proliferation of NIH3T3 cells, and knockdown of B55α expression increased survival of FL5.12 cells upon interleukin-3 deprivation. Together, our data demonstrate that B55α-dependent targeting of the PP2A holoenzyme to Akt selectively regulates Akt phosphorylation at Thr-308 to regulate cell proliferation and survival.

Deregulated Akt activity has been linked to the formation of various human malignancies such as gastric adenocarcinoma, ovarian cancer, breast cancer, and thyroid cancer (5Vivanco I. Sawyers C.L.

Akt is a crucial signal transducer downstream of phosphatidylinositide 3′-OH kinase (PI3K) that is activated upon ligand and receptor engagement on the cell surface. The Akt family consists of three major isoforms, Akt1/PKBα, Akt2/PKBβ, and Akt3/PKBγ, that have conserved functional domains, including an N-terminal pleckstrin homology domain, a central kinase domain, and a C-terminal regulatory domain. Recruitment of Akt to the plasma membrane upon activation of PI3K results in a conformational change, and phosphorylation of Thr-308 and Ser-473 after membrane recruitment of Akt leads to full activation of Akt (6Hanada M.

It has long been known that PP2A negatively regulates Akt activity in various systems. PP2A holoenzymes consist of a dimeric core enzyme, which includes the catalytic subunit C, the structural subunit A, and a variable regulatory subunit B (18Janssens V. Goris J. Biochem.

It is thought that the diverse regulatory subunits dictate substrate specificity and subcellular localization of PP2A. Signaling modules composed of PP2A and variable kinases have been identified and are believed to increase the fidelity of signaling transduction process. The kinases that have been found to interact with PP2A include calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (29Westphal R.S. Anderson K.A. Means A.R. Wadzinski B.E.

Although it remains unclear whether B regulatory subunits are involved in the interactions between these kinases and PP2A, several reports using overexpression and RNA interference approaches have demonstrated the roles of the B55 regulatory subunits (42Silverstein A.M.

EMBO J. 2006; 25: 727-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) in the MAPK signaling pathway in multiple systems. Two reports have suggested the involvement of the B56 family in regulating Akt phosphorylation (43Van Kanegan M.J. Adams D.G. Wadzinski B.E. Strack S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36029-36036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 46Rocher G. Letourneux C. Lenormand P. Porteu F. J. Biol.

Intriguingly, cells expressing a mutant Aα subunit with selective B56 subunit binding deficiency showed decreased phosphorylation of Akt (43Van Kanegan M.J. Adams D.G. Wadzinski B.E. Strack S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36029-36036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). IEX, an early response gene involved in survival and proliferation, was shown to increase Akt phosphorylation by inhibiting B56-containing PP2A holoenzymes via an extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-dependent manner (46Rocher G. Letourneux C. Lenormand P. Porteu F. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5468-5477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Here we report the identification of B55α as an Akt-targeting regulatory subunit of PP2A. Importantly, we demonstrate that B55α preferentially targets the PP2A holoenzyme to dephosphorylate Akt at Thr-308 rather than Ser-473 both in cells and in vitro, indicating substrate (site) specificity determined by the specific PP2A B regulatory subunit at the intramolecular level. Furthermore, consistent with the regulatory activity on ERKs and Akt signaling pathways, we demonstrate that B55α plays roles in regulating cell proliferation and survival. Antibodies and Reagents—Antibodies employed include the following: anti-phospho-Akt Ser-473, anti-phospho-Akt Thr-308, anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (Thr-202/Tyr-204), anti-HA, pan-anti-phospho-(Ser/Thr) Akt substrate, anti-phospho-FoxO1/3a (Thr-24/Thr-32), and anti-PP2A/B from Cell Signaling; and anti-PP2A/A from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; anti-PP2A/B clone 2G9 from Upstate; anti-Akt and anti-PP2A/C from BD Transduction Laboratories; anti-GSK from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; anti-GST from GE Healthcare; and anti-B56γ3 from Novus. Serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitors and okadaic acid (OA) were from Alexis Biochemicals, and microcystin-LR was from Calbiochem. Protease inhibitors, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), aprotinin, leupeptin, bacterial protease inhibitor mixture, anti-β-actin, anti-FLAG M2 antibodies, and anti-FLAG M2-agarose were from Sigma. The specific anti-B55δ antibody was kindly provided by Dr. Brian Wadzinski (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN). DNA Constructs and Retrovirus Preparation—The full-length human Akt1 cDNA with a C-terminal FLAG tag was prepared by PCR using a template of human Akt1 (kindly provided by Dr. P. C. Lin, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN) and was subsequently cloned into the bacterial expression vector pQE30 and the retroviral pMSCVpuro vector (Clontech). The C-terminal HA-tagged rat B55α and human B56γ3 were prepared by PCR using the pCEP4B55α and pCEP4B56γ3, respectively, as a template (kindly provided by Dr. David Virshup, University of Utah, Salt Lake City) and were subsequently cloned into the retroviral pMSCVpuro vector and the bacterial expression pGEX4T-1 vector (GE Healthcare). The sequence encoding short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting B55α was synthesized as two complementary oligonucleotides as described before (44Adams D.G. Coffee Jr., R.L. Zhang H. Pelech S. Strack S. Wadzinski B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42644-42654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), which were subsequently phosphorylated, annealed, and ligated into the pSUPERretropuro vector (47Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3968) Google Scholar). The retroviral expression vectors, pMSCVpuro and pSUPERretropuro, harboring Akt cDNA, B55α cDNA, B56γ3 cDNA, or B55α shRNA-encoding sequence, were transfected into BOSC23 cells by the calcium phosphate method, and viral supernatants were prepared by collecting the BOSC23 culture media 48 h after transfection and centrifugation at 1,500 rpm for 5 min. Cell Culture—FL5.12 cells were cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and interleukin 3 (IL-3) as described before (48Chiang C.W. Harris G. Ellig C. Masters S.C. Subramanian R. Shenolikar S. Wadzinski B.E. Yang E. Blood. 2001; 97: 1289-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). NIH3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% bovine serum (BS). BOSC23 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. In serum stimulation experiments, NIH3T3 cells were grown in medium containing 0.5% BS for 14–16 h and were stimulated with 10% BS-containing medium. In IL-3 deprivation experiments, FL5.12 cells were grown in medium without IL-3 for 3 h and then stimulated with medium containing IL-3. In IL-3-dependent survival assay, cells were deprived of IL-3 for 24 h. In proliferation assays, NIH3T3 cells stably carrying vector or expressing B55αHA were seeded onto 24-well plates, and cell numbers were directly counted. Viability was measured by trypan blue exclusion. Selection of Cells Stably Expressing FLAG-tagged Akt, FLAG-tagged B55α, HA-tagged B55α, HA-tagged B56γ3, B55α shRNA, or Vector Only—The cells stably expressing genes of interest were created by retroviral infection and subsequent drug selection. Cells were infected with retroviruses for 2 days and then selected with puromycin at 5 μg/ml. Cells stably expressing FLAG-tagged Akt, FLAG-tagged B55α, HA-tagged B55α, HA-tagged B56γ3, B55α shRNA, or vector only were isolated after a 2-day drug selection and characterized by immunoblotting for specific gene expression. Immunoblotting and Immunoprecipitation—Cell lysates for immunoblotting were prepared in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (10 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, and 1 mm EDTA) containing 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 1 μm microcystin, and 1 mm Na3VO4. Cell lysates for immunoprecipitation were prepared as described before (49McCright B. Rivers A.M. Audlin S. Virshup D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22081-22089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Cells were lysed in hypotonic buffer A (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA) supplemented with 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, followed by sonication. The lysates were then subjected to centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was then adjusted to isotonic osmolarity by adding 1/10 volume of buffer B (1.4 m KCl, 30 mm MgCl2). Immunoprecipitation assays were carried out using control IgG or a specific antibody in isotonic buffer, as described above, and precipitated using protein A/G-Sepharose. The immune complexes were then washed with wash buffer (isotonic buffer plus 0.2% Triton X-100) three times and were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Immunoblots were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence. Results were quantified by densitometry using Alpha Innotech AlphaImager. In Vitro Akt Dephosphorylation Assay—NIH3T3 cells expressing FLAG-tagged Akt were serum-starved for 16 h and stimulated with 10% BS for 5 min. Cells were lysed in the immunoprecipitation buffer as described above without phosphatase inhibitors, and FLAG-tagged Akt was immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG-agarose. The PP2A-B55α holoenzymes were prepared from NIH3T3 cells expressing FLAG-tagged B55α by immunoprecipitating FLAG-tagged B55α immunocomplexes using anti-FLAG-agarose. The FLAG-tagged Akt or B55α immunocomplexes were then resuspended in the phosphatase assay buffer (20 mm imidazole, 150 mm NaCl, 14.4 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Aliquots of Akt immunocomplexes were then mixed with various amounts of B55α immunocomplexes preincubated with or without 100 nm OA for 10 min at 4 °C and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. Dephosphorylation reactions were terminated by adding 4× SDS sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. Results were quantified by densitometry using Alpha Innotech AlphaImager. Percentages of reduction of phosphorylation were calculated by subtracting the relative phosphorylation of reactions containing PP2A-B55α from 100 (control reactions with no addition of PP2A-B55α complexes were set as 100%), and the values were further normalized by relative amounts of pulled down C subunits (Thr(P)-308 versus Ser(P)-473) in individual reactions within a set input of PP2A-B55α complexes. Recombinant Proteins—Bacterial expression constructs employed include pQE30-His6-Akt-FLAG, pGEX-4T-1-B55-HA, pGEX-4T-PP2A/A (a gift from Dr. Kerry Campbell, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia), and pGEX-4T-1-PP2A/C. Each individual expression construct was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 cells. Appropriate antibiotics were applied to select bacteria carrying the expression constructs. Isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added at various concentrations (0.2 to 1 mm) to induce the optimal expression of the recombinant proteins. The bacterial culture was pelleted and resuspended in lysis buffer (phosphate-buffered saline with 1% Triton X-100 and 1% Tween 20 for GST fusion clones, and 50 mm Na2HPO4, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole for His-tagged clones) containing 1 mg/ml lysozyme, and a bacterial protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). GST fusion protein was purified with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare) under native conditions following the manufacturer's protocols. His-tagged protein was purified with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) under native conditions following the manufacturer's protocols. In Vitro Pulldown Analysis—For analyzing in vitro interactions of individual PP2A subunits and Akt, 2 μg of purified recombinant GST-PP2A/A, GST-PP2A/B, or GST-PP2A/C protein were incubated with 2 μg of purified recombinant His-tagged Akt for 4 h at 4 °C. GST fusion proteins were pulled down by glutathione-Sepharose 4B, washed three times with wash buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.2% Triton X-100), fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Akt or anti-GST antibody. Akt Is Associated with PP2A AB55αC Holoenzyme Complexes—We addressed the role of B regulatory subunits in bridging the association between PP2A and Akt in the signaling module by exploiting two systems, serum-dependent NIH3T3 cells and interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent FL5.12 lymphoid cells. NIH3T3 cells are highly transfectable and easily activate Akt by serum stimulation. The IL-3-dependent FL5.12 lymphoid cell represents one of cytokine-dependent hematopoietic cells in which the PI3K/Akt pathway is crucial to cellular survival (50Songyang Z. Baltimore D. Cantley L.C.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7779-7786Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). In FL5.12 cells, treatment with the protein phosphatase inhibitor OA at 250 nm that was shown to selectively inhibit PP2A (48Chiang C.W. Harris G. Ellig C. Masters S.C. Subramanian R. Shenolikar S. Wadzinski B.E. Yang E. Blood. 2001; 97: 1289-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) resulted in significantly increased phosphorylation of Akt at Thr-308, and to a lesser extent at Ser-473 (Fig. 1A), suggesting that PP2A constantly regulated phosphorylation of Akt in FL5.12 cells. We then explored the possible involvement of a specific PP2A holoenzyme in regulating Akt activity in FL5.12 cells. The B55/PR55 family was shown to be widely expressed and displaced from the PP2A holoenzyme by the DNA tumor virus SV40 small T antigen (52Sontag E. Fedorov S. Kamibayashi C. Robbins D. Cobb M.

We immunoprecipitated endogenous B55 by a pan-anti-B55 antibody from the FL5.12 cells and examined the association of Akt in the immunoprecipitated complexes. Significantly, Akt was co-immunoprecipitated with B55 subunits (Fig. 1B), and as expected, A and C subunits were also co-immunoprecipitated with B55 subunits (Fig. 1B). Because the pan-anti-B55 antibody preferentially reacts with the α isoform, we next investigated the possible association of PP2A AB55αC holoenzyme (hereafter referred to as PP2A-B55α holoenzyme) with Akt. HA-tagged B55α (B55αHA) was ectopically expressed in NIH3T3 cells and subsequently pulled down by anti-HA antibody. Co-immunoprecipitation analyses of B55αHA-associated complexes revealed that endogenous Akt was co-immunoprecipitated with PP2A-B55α holoenzymes in cells expressing B55αHA but not in parental NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 1C). In addition, the endogenous A (PP2A/A) and C subunits (PP2A/C) were co-immunoprecipitated with the exogenous B55αHA (Fig. 1C), indicating that the B55αHA associates with endogenous AC core enzyme and forms an AB55αHA holoenzyme complex. Furthermore, it was not clear whether B55α has the ability to directly associate with Akt and targets PP2A holoenzyme to Akt. We addressed this issue with in vitro interaction assays using bacterially expressed recombinant proteins. Recombinant GST, GST-fused PP2A/Aα, PP2A/B55α, or PP2A/Cα proteins were incubated with recombinant His-tagged Akt proteins and pulled down using glutathione-Sepharose. The results (Fig. 2) showed that His-tagged Akt proteins were pulled down with GST-fused B55α proteins by glutathione-Sepharose but not with control GST, GST-PP2A/Aα, or GST-PP2A/Cα proteins. These data demonstrate that B55α subunit directly targets the PP2A-B55α holoenzyme to interact with Akt.FIGURE 2Recombinant PP2A B55α regulatory subunit interacts with recombinant Akt in vitro. In vitro GST pulldown analyses were performed by mixing 3 μg of recombinant GST, GST-PP2A/Aα, GST-PP2A/Cα, or GST-PP2A/B55α with 2 μg of recombinant His-Akt and incubating at 4 °C. GST pulldowns were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting by specific antibodies for GST and Akt. Asterisks indicate the intact full-length GST-PP2A subunit fusion proteins. Fifty percent of input recombinant His-Akt proteins (1 μg) were loaded in parallel and detected as a control.

Akt achieves its full activity through phosphorylation at both Thr-308 and Ser-473 upon stimulation by growth factors or cytokines (57Alessi D"

Although previous studies suggest that DJ-1 is cytoprotective, the mechanism by which DJ-1 exerts its survival functions remains largely unknown. Here we show that DJ-1 exerts its cytoprotection through inhibiting p53-Bax-caspase pathway. DJ-1 interacts with p53 in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of DJ-1 decreases the expression of Bax and inhibits caspase activation, whereas knockdown of DJ-1 increases Bax protein levels and accelerates caspase-3 activation and cell death induced by UV exposure. Our data provide evidence that the protective effects of DJ-1 on apoptosis are associated with its ability of decreasing Bax level through inhibiting p53 transcriptional activity.

DJ-1, a ubiquitously expressed protein identified as an oncogene product, was first found to be involved in breast cancer, lung cancer, and prostate cancer (1Nagakubo D. Taira T. Kitaura H. Ikeda M.

Gromoll J. Cooper T.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 545-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Although the exact function of DJ-1 remains unclear, increasing studies reveal that DJ-1 has multiple roles in various biological processes. Above all, DJ-1 scavenges oxidative stress by oxidizing itself to a more acidic form and/or by increasing glutathione synthesis through an increase of glutamate cysteine ligase (6Taira T. Saito Y. Niki T. Iguchi-Ariga S.M. Takahashi K. Ariga H. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar, 7Zhou W. Freed C.R. J. Biol.

Overexpression of DJ-1 in animals or cultured cells prevents cell death through its anti-oxidative stress activities, whereas knockdown or knock-out of DJ-1 increases the susceptibility to oxidative stress (6Taira T.

DJ-1, structurally similar to Hsp31, has chaperone activity that prevents the aggregation of α-synuclein depending on DJ-1 oxidation state (7Zhou W. Freed C.R. J. Biol.

Furthermore, studies implicate that DJ-1 plays an important role in anti-apoptosis (12Junn E. Taniguchi H. Jeong B.S. Zhao X. Ichijo H. Mouradian M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Overexpression of DJ-1 in prostatic benign hyperplasia (BPH-1) cell line causes its resistance to apoptosis induced by cytotoxic agents, whereas knockdown of DJ-1 enhances apoptosis of PC-3 (prostatic cancer) cells by the same toxic reagent (13Hod Y. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 92: 1221-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Overexpression of DJ-1 blocks neuronal apoptosis by inhibiting transcriptional silencing activity of the pyrimidine tract-binding protein-associated splicing factor (PSF) or by preventing the translocation of Daxx from nucleus to cytoplasm where Daxx activates apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) death pathway (12Junn E.

Seino C. Iguchi-Ariga S.M. Ariga H. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 96-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Moreover, cells harboring DJ-1 are much more resistant to UV-induced apoptosis than DJ-1 knockdown cells (15Shinbo Y. Niki T. Taira T. Ooe H. Takahashi-Niki K. Maita C. Seino C. Iguchi-Ariga S.M. Ariga H. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 96-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Besides those biological functions, DJ-1 was reported to function as an important transcriptional regulator in multiple pathways including restoring p53 transcriptional activity through its interaction with Topors/p53BP3 (14Xu J.

PD is a common neurodegenerative disorder caused by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta 25). Although most cases of PD are sporadic, studies on the rare familial forms of PD due to inherited gene mutations have yielded crucial insights into the possible etiology of this disease. Many pathogenic mutations have been identified in DJ-1 including exonic deletion and missense mutations in populations of various ethnic origins (21Bonifati V. Rizzu P. van Baren M.J. Schaap O.

Most recently, it was reported that knockdown of DJ-1 in zebrafish up-regulates Bax and enhances the cell death of dopaminergic neurons under oxidative stress, providing evidence that DJ-1 was able to regulate the Bax level in vivo (26Bretaud S. Allen C. Ingham P.W. Bandmann O. J. Neurochem. 2007; 100: 1626-1635PubMed Google Scholar). In our present study we show that DJ-1 interacts with p53 and down-regulates Bax in a p53-dependent manner. Our study implicates that the inhibition of p53 transcriptional activity by DJ-1 may play a role in control of p53-Bax-caspase apoptotic pathway. Plasmid Constructs–Full-length DJ-1 cDNA was first amplified by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR using total RNA extracted from 293 cells with primers 5′-CGGGATCCCCATGGCTTCCAAAAGAAG-3′ and 5′-CGCTCGAGCTGCTGGAGTCTTTAAGAAC-3′. The PCR product was inserted into pGEX-5x-1 at BamHI/XhoI sites or pEGFP-N1 at BglII/SalI sites. pET-15b-DJ-1 was generated by subcloning the PCR product, amplified with primers 5′-CCCTCGAGATGGCTTCCAAAAGAGC-3′ and 5′-CGGGATCCGCTGCTCTAGTCTTTAAG-3′, into pET-15b vector. For creating a construct expressing FLAG-DJ-1, we cut out the full-length DJ-1 cDNA at XhoI/BamHI sites from pET-15b-DJ-1 and subcloned this fragment into p3×FLAG-Myc-CMV vector (Sigma). The human p53 cDNA was first obtained by PCR from a human fetal brain cDNA library (Clontech) with primers 5′-CGCGGATCCAAATGGAGGAGCCGCAG-3′ and 5′-CCGCTCGAGTGTTTGTCTGAGTCAGGC-3′ and then inserted into pGEX-5x-1 at BamHI/XhoI sites. pEGFP-N1-p53 was generated by excising p53 cDNA from pGEX-5x-1-p53 and inserting into pEGFP-N1. To create the construct expressing FLAG-p53, we inserted the PCR product, amplified with primers 5′-CCGCTCGAGATGGAGGAGCCGCAGTC-3′ and 5′-CGCGGATCCTCAGTCTGAGTCAGG-3′, into p3×FLAG-Myc-CMV vector (Sigma) at SalI/BamHI sites. The deletion mutants of p53 were generated by PCR with different primers. pGEX-5x-1-p53(NT) was created by subcloning the PCR product, amplified with primers 5′-CGCGGATCCAAATGGAGGAGCCGCAG-3′ and 5′-CCGCTCGAGCTTTTCTGGGAAGGGAC-3′ using pGEX-5x-1-p53 as the template, into pGEX-5x-1, pGEX-5x-1-p53(DBD), amplified with primers 5′-CGGGATCCAAATGTACCAGGGCAGC-3′ and 5′-CCGCTCGAGCTTTTCTTGCGGAGATT-3′, and pGEX-5x-1-p53(CT) amplified with primers 5′-CGGGATCCAAATGGAGCCTCACCAC-3′ and 5′-CCGCTCGAGTGTTTGTCTGAGTCAGGC-3′. In Vitro Binding Assays–For GST pulldown assays, an aliquot containing 20 μg of protein from the soluble fraction of Escherichia coli cell lysates containing GST or GST-p53 was incubated with 20 μl of glutathione agarose beads (GE Healthcare) for 30 min on ice. After washing 3 times with 1× phosphate-buffered saline to remove unbound materials, the beads were further incubated with 50 μg of protein from the supernatants of E. coli crude extract containing recombinant DJ-1 expressed by pET-15b-DJ-1 in 0.25 ml of HNTG buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol) for 1 h at 4 °C. After incubation, the beads were washed 5 times with 1 ml of 1× HNTG buffer. Bound proteins were eluted from the beads by boiling for 5 min in SDS sample buffer and visualized by immunoblot analysis. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Apoptosis Assay–N2a cells or 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% calf serum (Invitrogen), whereas A549 cells or H1299 cells were maintained in RPMI medium 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). Cells were transfected with expressing vectors using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Forty-eight hours after transfection cells were further incubated with 200 μm H2O2 for 6 h to induce apoptosis. Alternatively, cells were exposed to ultraviolet (UV)-B 48 h after transfection. Apoptosis were assessed using FACScalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Briefly, cells were harvested, rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated with annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate and propidium iodide (PI) according to the manufacture's instructions (Biosea, Beijing, China). Data analysis was performed with CELLQuest software, and numbers of cells labeled with annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate or PI or combination were calculated. DJ-1 siRNA Knockdown–Double-stranded oligonucleotides synthesized by Shanghai GenePharma (Shanghai, China) were designed against three separate regions starting from nucleotide 32 or nucleotide 328 or nucleotide 549 of mouse DJ-1 cDNA. The sequences of these duplexes are: sense 5′-CCAAAGGAGCAGAGGAGAUTT-3 and antisense 5′-AUCUCCUCUGCUCCUUUGGTT-3′ for si-DJ-1 32; sense 5′-GGCUCUGUUGGCUCACGAATT-3′ and antisense 5′-UUCGUGAGCCAACAGAGCCGT-3′ for si-DJ-1 328, sense 5′-CGCUUGUUCUCAAAGACUATT-3′ and antisense 5′-UAGUCUUUGAGAACAAGCGGT-3′ for si-DJ-1 549. Meanwhile, oligonucleotide targeting against GAPDH served as the positive control, whereas an irrelevant oligonucleotide served as the negative control. The transfection was performed with Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) according to its manufacture when cells grew to reach 40–50% confluence. Briefly, a mixture of Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen) with Oligofectamine was incubated for 5 min and incubated with siRNA for a further 30 min at room temperature to allow the complex formation. At 12 h post-transfection, the culture medium was replaced by fresh complete medium. Cells were harvested 72 h after transfection followed by further analysis. Isoelectric Focusing and Immunoblot Analysis–Proteins were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE or in isoelectric focusing gel of pH 5–8 ranges followed by transferring to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). The following primary antibodies were used. Monoclonal anti-Bax antibody and anti-p53 antibody were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Monoclonal anti-GFP antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology or Roche Applied Science. Monoclonal anti-GAPDH antibody was from Chemicon. Monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody and anti-FLAG antibody conjugated with HRP were from Sigma. Polyclonal anti-GFP antibodies, anti-p53 antibodies, anti-Erk1 antibodies, anti-caspase-9 antibodies, and anti-caspase-3 antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Polyclonal anti-DJ-1 antibodies were from Chemicon. The secondary antibodies, sheep anti-mouse IgG-HRP antibodies, or anti-rabbit IgG-HRP antibodies were from Amersham Biosciences. The proteins were visualized using an ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). To reprobe the membrane for another primary antibody, the membrane was first incubated with Stripping buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 20 mm SDS) for 30 min at 50 °C. Then the membrane was subjected to immunoblot analysis following the standard protocol. Immunoprecipitation–293 cells co-transfected with FLAG-p53 along with EGFP or DJ-1-EGFP were collected 48 h after transfection and lysed in TSPI buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40 supplemented with complete mini protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were incubated with monoclonal anti-GFP antibody (Roche Applied Science) or anti-FLAG antibody for 1 h at 4 °C. After incubation, protein G-Sepharose was used for precipitation. The beads were washed with TSPI buffer four times and then eluted with SDS sample buffer for immunoblot analysis using anti-DJ-1 antibodies or anti-FLAG antibody. Alternatively, 4 μg of monoclonal anti-p53 antibody or normal mouse IgG was incubated with protein G-Sepharose for 6 h at 4 °C, and then equal amounts of supernatant from A549 or H1299 cell lysates were added and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The resin was washed six times with TSPI buffer and resuspended in SDS sample buffer. Proteins were subjected to immunoblot analysis using anti-DJ-1 or anti-p53 antibodies. Luciferase Reporter Gene Assay and RT-PCR–H1299 cells were co-transfected with pGL3-Bax Luciferase construct with or without a fixed amount of FLAG-p53 along with EGFP or DJ-1-EGFP. Renilla-expressing plasmid pRL-CMV was co-transfected to normalize the variations in transfection efficiency. The total amount of plasmid DNA was kept constant by the addition of empty plasmid. Cell lysates were prepared using Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega) 48 h after the transfection. Both firefly and Renilla activities were measured with Dual Luciferase Reporter Systems using Veritas Microplate luminometer according to the manufacturer's instructions. The absolute values of firefly luminescence were normalized to those of Renilla, and the ratios were presented as the mean ± S.E. with three transfection experiments. Meanwhile, total RNA from those cells was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and then subjected to RT-PCR with primers 5′-TCAAAGAGGCGAACTGTGTG-3′ and 5′-GGTGTTGGAGCAAGATGGAT-3′ for luciferase. DJ-1 Protects against Hydrogen Peroxide-induced Apoptosis by Down-regulating Bax in a p53-dependent Manner–To investigate whether DJ-1 protects against cell death in our cellular model, Neuro2a (N2a) cells, a mouse neuroblastoma cell line, were transiently transfected with DJ-1-EGFP or EGFP alone. Forty-eight hours after transfection cells were exposure to 200 μm hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) for 4 h. Then the cells were collected, and the cell lysates were subjected to immunoblot analysis. The cleaved form of caspase-9 (p35) was detected from cells transfected with EGFP using antibodies specific to cleaved caspase-9, whereas it was not detected from cells expressing DJ-1-EGFP (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, pro-caspase-3 was also processed into the active form (p17) in cells expressing EGFP but not in cells expressing DJ-1-EGFP (Fig. 1A). Based on the observation that DJ-1 inhibits caspase cleavage under oxidative stress, we next searched for the factors upstream of caspase activation. Bax, a proapoptotic member of bcl-2 family, is considered as an important molecule in apoptotic cell death. Therefore, we examined the level of Bax in the presence or absence of overexpressed DJ-1. The levels of Bax are markedly decreased in N2a cells expressing DJ-1-EGFP compared with cells expressing EGFP alone (Fig. 1B). Quantitative data are shown in Fig. 1C. The same results were obtained using human embryo kidney 293 cells (Fig. 1, D and E). However, the protein levels of p53 (Fig. 1F) as well as SOD1 (Fig. 1G) remain unchanged. It is well known that p53 is important for Bax transcription. To further determine whether the down-regulation of Bax is dependent on p53, we transfected A549 (p53+/+) cells and H1299 (p53-/-) cells with DJ-1-EGFP or EGFP and treated the cells with H2O2 or not. In A549 cells overexpression of DJ-1 decreases the Bax levels in both groups that are treated with H2O2 or not (Fig. 2A). Quantitative data are shown in Fig. 2B. However, in p53-null H1299 cells, overexpression of DJ-1 does not affect the Bax levels (Fig. 2, C and D), suggesting that the down-regulation of Bax by DJ-1 depends on the presence of p53. To further determine that p53 is involved in the regulation of Bax by DJ-1, we co-transfected H1299 cells with or without DJ-1-EGFP in the presence of FLAG-p53. Expression of FLAG-p53 in H1299 cells increases the Bax level as compared with expression of FLAG-tag alone (Fig. 2E), suggesting that FLAG-p53 restores the function to up-regulate Bax. However, the Bax level in H1299 cells coexpressing FLAG-p53 and DJ-1-EGFP is significantly lower than that in cells coexpressing FLAG-p53 and EGFP (Fig. 2E), suggesting that the presence of p53 is indeed necessary for DJ-1 effects on Bax expression. DJ-1 Protects against Apoptosis Induced by Ultraviolet Exposure–Although we observed that overexpression of DJ-1 down-regulates Bax with or without H2O2 stimulus, the Bax levels as well as p53 levels are not increased in the H2O2-treated cellular model. To further determine that the protective effect of DJ-1 is relevant to p53-dependent cell death, we exposed DJ-1-overexpressing cells to UV light, a widely accepted stimulus initiating p53-Bax-caspase cell death pathway (27Latonen L. Laiho M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1755: 71-89PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm the toxic effect of UV in our cellular model, we exposed N2a cells to various doses of UV and recovered for 12 h followed by treatment with PI, which stains the nuclei of late apoptotic and dead cells. As shown in Fig. 3A, the PI positive staining cells are increased with the increase of UV exposure dose, indicating that UV exposure leads to cell death in a dose-dependent manner in N2a cells. Immunoblot analysis showed that UV exposure increases the Bax and p53 protein levels in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 3, B and C). In addition, a shift in pI of endogenous DJ-1 to a more acidic point was observed after UV exposure. Such a shift was also found in cells treated with hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 3D). Based on these observations, we next determine the role of DJ-1 in UV-induced cell death. N2a cells transiently transfected with FLAG-DJ-1 or FLAG were exposed to UV (20 mJ/cm2) or not 2 days after transfection and then recovered for 6 h followed by annexin V/PI staining and flow cytometry analysis. In each dot-plot shown in Fig. 3E, the lower right quadrant indicates the population of cells labeled with annexin V, representing the early apoptotic cells, whereas the upper right quadrant indicates those with both annexin V and PI staining, representing late apoptotic and dead cells. The percentages of apoptotic cells are low in N2a cells expressing FLAG or FLAG-DJ-1 without UV exposure. However, after UV treatment, the percentages of annexin V-positive and annexin V/PI-positive cells increase to 17.43 and 10.93% in cells expressing FLAG, respectively. In contrast, they decrease significantly to 8.04 and 7.41% in those cells expressing FLAG-DJ-1, supporting the cytoprotective role of DJ-1 in UV-induced cell death (Fig. 3E). To further explore whether the protective effect is correlated with any change of Bax protein level, we transfected N2a cells with DJ-1-EGFP or EGFP and exposed the cells to UV. As shown in Fig. 3F, in N2a cells, overexpression of DJ-1 decreases Bax levels both in the absence and presence of UV exposure, although UV exposure increases Bax levels. Quantitative data are shown in Fig. 3H. Furthermore, procaspase-3 is also processed into the active form (p17) in cells expressing EGFP but not in cells expressing DJ-1-EGFP with the UV stimulus (Fig. 3G). Although p53 increases obviously after UV exposure, overexpression of DJ-1 has little effect on p53 protein levels (Fig. 3G). Quantitative data are shown in Fig. 3I. Silencing DJ-1 Increases Bax and Facilitates UV-induced Cell Death in a p53-dependent Manner–To further assess the effect of DJ-1 on Bax regulation, we investigated the impact of DJ-1 silencing in our cellular model. N2a cells were transfected with specific RNA oligonucleotides targeting against DJ-1 or control RNA oligonucleotides, and the whole cell lysates were collected 72 h after transfection and subjected to immunoblot analysis. Transfection with the two pairs of RNA oligonucleotides against two different regions of DJ-1 successfully suppresses the protein level of DJ-1 as compared with that in cells transfected with control siRNAs (Fig. 4A). Meanwhile, the protein levels of Bax increase synchronously along with the decrease of DJ-1 (Fig. 4A). Quantitative data are shown in Fig. 4B. Next, we went on to determine whether knockdown of DJ-1 affects the protective role of DJ-1 in UV-induced cell death. N2a cells transfected with siRNAs to DJ-1 or control siRNAs were exposed to UV (20 mJ/cm2) 2 days after transfection and recovered for another 6 h followed by flow cytometry analysis. Although transfection with mock siRNA results in negligible cell death, transfection with siRNA against DJ-1 leads to a significant increase in cell death in the absence and presence of UV exposure (Fig. 4C). Cleavage of caspase-3 was observed in cells transfected with siRNAs against DJ-1 but not in those with control siRNAs (Fig. 4D). These data suggest that knockdown of DJ-1 increases the protein level of Bax and makes N2a cells more susceptible to UV exposure. To further determine whether the increase of Bax protein level is related to the status of p53, we transfected both A549 (p53+/+) cells and H1299 (p53-/-) cells with control siRNAs and siRNAs against DJ-1. The total cell lysates were collected 72 h after transfection followed by immunoblot analysis and quantification (Fig. 4, E–H). Although the levels of DJ-1 protein decrease to a similar extent in both cell lines, the Bax protein level increases significantly in A549 cells (Fig. 4, E and G) but is unchanged in H1299 cells (Fig. 4, F and H), suggesting that the increase of Bax by knockdown of DJ-1 is dependent on the presence of p53. However, in A549 cells, no changes of the p53 protein levels were observed in cells transfected with siRNAs against DJ-1 and those with control siRNAs, implying that the p53 protein level is not regulated by DJ-1 (Fig. 4, E and G). Moreover, the dependence of Bax regulation by DJ-1 on p53 transcriptional activity is also determined by the experiments using pifithrin-α, an inhibitor of p53 transcriptional activity. A549 cells transfected with control siRNAs or siRNAs against DJ-1 were treated with 20 μm pifithrin-α (Sigma) or Me2SO (as a control) for 12 h, and the total cell lysates were collected followed by immunoblot analysis and quantification. Although siRNA knockdown of DJ-1 results in a significant increase of Bax level in cells treated with Me2SO, the Bax level only increases slightly in cells treated with pifithrin-α (Fig. 4I). Quantitative data are shown in Fig. 4J. These results suggest that regulation of Bax by DJ-1 is dependent on the presence of p53 transcriptional activity. Physical Interaction of DJ-1 with p53–Because DJ-1 down-regulates Bax in a p53-dependent manner, we therefore evaluated the binding of p53 with DJ-1 using GST pulldown assays.

Here we describe the impact of drug-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress on Arabidopsis seedlings and present evidence for the role of Arabidopsis BAX inhibitor-1 (AtBI1) as a modulator of ER stress-mediated PCD. We found that treatment of Arabidopsis seedlings with tunicamycin (TM), an inhibitor of N-linked glycosylation and an inducer of ER stress by triggering accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER, results in strong inhibition of root growth and loss of survival accompanied by typical hallmarks of PCD such as accumulation of H2O2, chromatin condensation, and oligonucleosomal fragmentation of nuclear DNA. These phenotypes are alleviated by co-treatment with either of two different chemical chaperones, sodium 4-phenylbutyrate and tauroursodeoxycholic acid, both with chaperone properties that can reduce the load of misfolded protein in the ER. Expression of AtBI1 mRNA and its promoter activity are increased dramatically prior to initiation of TM-induced PCD. Compared with wild-type plants, two AtBI1 mutants (atbi1-1 and atbi1-2) exhibit hypersensitivity to TM with accelerated PCD progression. Conversely, overexpressing AtBI1 markedly reduces the sensitivity of Arabidopsis seedlings to TM. However, alterations in AtBI1 gene expression levels do not cause a significant effect on the expression patterns of typical ER stress-inducible genes (AtBip2, AtPDI, AtCRT1, and AtCNX1). We propose that AtBI1 plays a pivotal role as a highly conserved survival factor during ER stress that acts in parallel to the unfolded protein response pathway.

The genes that control PCD are conserved across wide evolutionary distances in metazoans (3Lam E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 305-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). In mammals, apoptosis is prominently controlled through functionally conserved proteins such as CED9/BCL-2 (anti-apoptotic protein) and BAX (pro-apoptotic protein). To date, no such genes have been identified in plants. Nonetheless, several studies have revealed that transgenic expression of mammalian anti- or pro-apoptotic proteins in plants can influence regulatory pathways of cell death activation or suppression (3Lam E.

Furthermore, a number of studies have suggested similarities in morphological changes with apoptotic features as well as in some biochemical events such as activation of nucleases and caspase-like proteases, and release of cytochrome c from the mitochondrion (3Lam E.

BAX inhibitor-1 (BI-1) was first identified as a suppressor of cell death activated by BAX in yeast or mammalian cells (5Xu Q. Reed J.C. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 337-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). BI-1 is evolutionarily conserved and predicted to be a transmembrane protein that localizes predominantly to the ER (6Hückelhoven R.

Expression of plant BI-1 mRNA has been detected in various tissues, and its expression level is enhanced during senescence and under several types of biotic and abiotic stresses (8Bolduc N.

Overexpression of BI-1 from various plant species was shown to suppress BAX-, pathogen-, or abiotic stress-induced cell death in a variety of cells from yeast, plant, and mammalian origins (8Bolduc N.

A. 2001; 98: 12295-12300Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). These observations support the idea that BI-1 could have conserved function in diverse organisms. Recent genetic analysis of Arabidopsis BI-1 (AtBI1) demonstrated that AtBI1 is dispensable for normal plant growth and development, but plays a protective role against both phytotoxin- and heat stress-induced PCD (13Watanabe N. Lam E. Plant J. 2006; 45: 884-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Plant BI-1 is thus likely to play an important role as a survival factor under multiple stress conditions that could trigger PCD. The assembly and folding of secreted proteins in the ER is exquisitely regulated by a complex mechanism that maintains equilibrium between folded and unfolded proteins. Accumulation of misfolded or unfolded proteins in the ER triggers ER stress and may seriously affect the viability of cells. To cope with ER stress, ER-resident sensors (inositol-requiring 1, IRE1; PKR-like ER kinase, PERK; and membrane-tethered activating transcription factor 6, ATF6) detect misfolded or unfolded proteins and elicit ER stress signaling in animal cells, which includes induction of the highly conserved unfolded protein response (UPR) (17Kaufman R.J. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 1389-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar). In metazoans, if cells cannot relieve the ER stress caused by excessive and prolonged inputs, apoptosis is activated concomitant with induction of caspase activation, cytochrome c release and DNA fragmentation (18Boyce M. Yuan J. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 363-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). In mammals, members of the BCL-2 family (BCL-2, BAX, and BAK) localize not only to mitochondria but also to the ER and have been shown to influence ER homeostasis, apparently by influencing membrane permeability and Ca2+ levels of the ER (19Scorrano L. Oakes S.A. Opferman J.T. Cheng E.H. Sorcinelli M.D. Pozzan T. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2003; 300: 135-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (1213) Google Scholar). Recently, the function of mammalian BI-1 was shown to link to the protection of cells from ER stress-induced apoptosis. Cells isolated from BI-1 knockout mice exhibited heightened apoptosis induction during ER stress triggered by pharmacological agents such as tunicamycin (TM), thapsigargin, and brefeldin A. Conversely, overexpression of BI-1 protected cells in vitro against apoptosis induced by those ER stress inducers (20Bailly-Maitre B. Fondevila C. Kaldas F. Droin N. Luciano F. Ricci J.E. Croxton R.

Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 304-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Unlike in mammals, the mechanisms of UPR and ER stress-mediated cell death in plants remain unclear. Structural homologues for an ER stress sensor protein, IRE1, have only been characterized from Arabidopsis and rice (23Koizumi N. Martinez I.M. Kimata Y. Kohno K. Sano H. Chrispeels M.J. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 949-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 24Okushima Y. Koizumi N. Yamaguchi Y. Kimata Y. Kohno K. Sano H. Plant Cell Physiol. 2002; 43: 532-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Although homologues of ATF6 and PERK have not been identified in plants, the TM-inducible bZip60 transcription factor was shown to function in the signal transduction pathway of the UPR unique to plants (25Iwata Y. Koizumi N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 5280-5285Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Interestingly, gene expression studies have suggested that plants should possess the ability to induce a set of UPR-related genes in response to drug-induced ER stress in a similar manner as that found in mammalian systems (23Koizumi N. Martinez I.M. Kimata Y. Kohno K. Sano H. Chrispeels M.J. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 949-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 26Martinez I.M. Chrispeels M.J.

Furthermore, recent studies have shown that treatment of plant cell cultures with ER stress agents such as TM and cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) induces cell death with apoptotic morphology (28Crosti P. Malerba M. Bianchetti R. Protoplasma. 2001; 216: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 29Zuppini A. Navazio L. Mariani P. J.

Koizumi N. Planta. 2005; 220: 804-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). At present, however, the molecular components and pathways that regulate ER stress-mediated cell death in plants remain obscure. As plant BI-1 appears to localize predominantly to the ER, we hypothesized that plant BI-1 could also regulate cell death triggered by ER stress. Here, we report that Arabidopsis root cells exposed to TM, which has been extensively used as a pharmacological ER stress inducer in mammals and plants, die exhibiting typical hallmarks of PCD. We further show by reverse genetic approaches that AtBI1 level is a critical determinant for plant survival under ER stress. Together with the recent work in BI-1-deficient mice (20Bailly-Maitre B. Fondevila C. Kaldas F. Droin N. Luciano F. Ricci J.E. Croxton R. Krajewska M. Zapata J.M. Kupiec-Weglinski J.W. Farmer D. Reed J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Surface-sterilized seeds were first plated on one-half-strength Murashige and Skoog (0.5× MS) basal media (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 1% (w/v) sucrose, at 4 °C in the dark for 2 days and transferred to a controlled growth room under continuous light (100 μmol photons m–2 s–1 of light intensity) at 22 °C. Unless stated otherwise, 5- to 7-day-old plants were subjected to treatment of an ER stress inducer TM (0 to 0.5 μgml–1). TM was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Seedlings were treated with TM in a liquid culture containing 0.5× MS medium supplemented with 1.0% (w/v) sucrose for 6 h (temporal treatment) or for up to 72 h (continuous treatment). To evaluate the effect of chemical chaperones on TM-induced growth defect and cell death, 5- to 7-day-old plants were incubated in 0.5× MS medium supplemented with either 1 mm sodium 4-phenylbutyrate (PBA, Calbiochem) or 0.5 mm tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA, Calbiochem) in the presence of 0.5 μgml–1 TM. To observe the growth of Arabidopsis seedlings after chemical treatment, seedlings were washed five times with 0.5× MS medium and kept in the same well of a culture plate supplied with liquid 0.5× MS medium or transferred to normal 0.5× MS agar plates, and then grown for up to 5 days under constant illumination (100 μmol m–2 s–1) at 22 °C. Root growth was analyzed on 0.5× MS agar plates placed in a vertical position. RNA Extraction and AnalysisTotal RNA was isolated from 5- to 10-day-old Arabidopsis seedlings using Plant RNA Purification Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. After electrophoresis in denaturing conditions, 10 μg of RNA was transferred and UV cross-linked to a membrane (Hybond N+, GE Healthcare) according to standard protocols. Full-length cDNA fragments of AtBI1 were labeled with [32P]dCTP using a random-primed labeling kit (Invitrogen) and used as hybridization probes. Partial cDNA fragments encoding AtBip2 (At5g42020), PR-1 (At2g14610), and AtAct2 (At3g18780) were amplified by PCR (see bellows) and used as hybridization probes. Hybridization was performed using ExpressHyb solution (Clontech), as suggested by the manufacturer. For semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis, total RNA was isolated from root tissues of 9- to 10-day-old seedlings using Plant RNA Purification Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Reverse transcription was performed in a reaction using iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad) in a 10-μl reaction (25 °C for 5 min, 42 °C for 30 min, and 80 °C for 3 min) containing 0.5 μg of DNase I-treated total RNA. cDNA was diluted 1:5 in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 1 mm EDTA buffer prior to use as a template in semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis. PCR was performed for 25–30 cycles (94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s) in a 25-μl reaction containing 0.5 unit of Choice Taq Blue DNA polymerase (Denville Scientific), 200 μm dNTP, and 0.25 μm primers. The RT-PCR reactions (10 μl) were resolved by 1.5% (w/v) agarose gel electrophoresis, and ethidium bromide-stained gels were digitally photographed with a GelDoc 2000 photostation (Bio-Rad), and the invert image was analyzed using the software Quantify One (version 4.2.1). Primers used for amplifications were as follows: EL1627 (5′-CAGAAGCTGGAGCTATGATTC-3′) and EL1629 (5′-ACCTCGGTGAGATGGACTATG-3′) for AtBI1, EL1946 (5′-CACCAGGTCACATTTGAAGTGGA-3′) and EL1947 (5′-GCTCATCGTGAGACTCATCT-3′) for AtBip2, EL682 (5′-GTAGGTGCTCTTGTTCTTCCC-3′) and EL683 (5′-CACATAATTCCCACGAGGATC-3′) for PR-1, EL2705 (5′-CACCTGTGGAAAAGAAGAAACCAG-3′) and EL2706 (5′-CAAGCAACCAGTTGTTACTACTG-3′) for AtCNX1 (At5g61790), EL2707 (5′-CAAATGATATCCCAAGTCATACC-3′) and EL2708 (5′-ATGGGGATAATTTTGGGTTCGAAC-3′) for AtPDI (At1g77510), EL2709 (5′-GCTGAGGAAGAAGCAGAAGATG-3′) and EL2710 (5′-GGTAAAGAGAAGGAGAAAGTCAG-3′) for AtCRT1 (At5g56340), and EL3031 (5′-ATCCAAGCTGTTCTCTCCTTG-3′) and EL3033 (5′-AGAGCTTCTCCTTGATGTCTC-3′) for AtAct2. Isolation and Analysis of Genomic DNATotal genomic DNA was extracted from root tissues using DNeasy Plant Kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer's instruction. For each sample, 4 μg of DNA was subjected to 2.0% (w/v) agarose gel electrophoresis, stained with 0.1 μgml–1 ethidium bromide in Tris-EDTA buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 0.5 mm EDTA), and then washed with Tris-EDTA buffer. Fragmented DNA was visualized under UV light with a GelDoc 2000 photostation (Bio-Rad), and the image was analyzed using the software Quantify One (Bio-Rad). Analysis of AtBI1 Promoter Fused to GUS Reporter LinesThe DNA fragment containing a putative promoter region of AtBI1 (–753 to –1 bp from the translational initiation codon) was amplified by PCR using primers EL2368 (5′-AAGCTTTTGCAGAGTTAGTTTGAATGTGTGGT-3′) and EL2369 (5′-TCTAGATGTTTCGTTTTTTTTGCTTGACTTTGA-3′) from genomic DNA isolated from WT and cloned into a pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). The BamHI and XhoI fragment containing AtBI1 promoter region was subcloned into SalI and BamHI sites of a binary vector pBI101 (31Jefferson R.A. Kavanagh T.A. Bevan M.W. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3901-3907Crossref PubMed Scopus (8126) Google Scholar). This construct, designated pNW204 (ProAtBI1::GUS) was introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101/pMP90. Arabidopsis WT (Col-0) or atbi1-2 mutant was transformed by the floral dip method (32Clough S.J. Bent A.F. Plant J. 1998; 16: 735-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Kanamycin-resistant T1 plants were selected on 0.5× MS media containing 50 mg l–1 kanamycin and 200 mg l–1 carbenicillin and then transferred to soil for seed production. T2 lines that segregated 3:1 resistant:sensitive were selected from self-fertilized T1 plants. Specific GUS expression patterns controlled by AtBI1 promoter in multiple independent transgenic lines were confirmed under unstressed and stressed conditions. Control transgenic plants with pBI101 or wild-type plants did not reveal any detectable GUS activity (data not shown). For quantitative GUS assay, 7-day-old transgenic seedlings were subjected to a chemical treatment with TM as described above, and then total proteins were extracted using extraction buffer (0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). GUS activity was measured by fluorometric detection of hydrolysis of 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-d-glucuronide (Sigma-Aldrich) as described previously (31Jefferson R.A. Kavanagh T.A. Bevan M.W. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3901-3907Crossref PubMed Scopus (8126) Google Scholar). The amount of 4-methylumbelliferone (Sigma-Aldrich), the end-product produced by GUS, liberated during reaction was measured fluorometrically (excitation of 360/40 nm and emission of 460/40 nm) with a fluorescence microtiter-plate reader (Synergy HT, Bio-Tek). GUS activity was calculated in units of μmol of 4-methylumbelliferone/mg of protein/min. Generation of Transgenic Plants Expressing V5-His6-tagged AtBI1The DNA construct of V5-His6-tagged AtBI1 in pYES2.1-TOPO (NT845) was kindly provided by Drs. N. Tumer and B. Çakir (Rutgers University). The BamHI and XbaI fragment of AtBI1-V5-His6 was subcloned into the binary vector EL103 (derived from pBI121) to allow expression from a CaMV 35S promoter. This construct, designated pNW166 (35S:AtBI1-V5His6), was used for A. tumefaciens-mediated transformation as described above. The resulting transgenic T1 seeds were selected by plating on 0.5× MS media containing 50 μgml–1 kanamycin and 200 μgml–1 carbenicillin, and then transferred to soil for seed production. Independent transformants were screened for expression levels of the AtBI1 transgene by RNA gel blot analysis and/or the protein expression level by Western blot analysis using anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen). Rescue of atbi1-2 mutation by 35S:AtBI1-V5His6 was confirmed in multiple independent transgenic lines at the T2 generation. Measurement of Chlorophyll ContentTotal chlorophylls were extracted from individual seedlings with 80% (v/v) acetone at 4 °C overnight. Chlorophyll content was determined spectrophotometrically from the absorbance at 663 nm and 646 nm according to Lichtenthaler (33Lichtenthaler H.K. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 18: 350-382Crossref Scopus (8704) Google Scholar). Ion Leakage MeasurementThe progression of cell death was assayed by measuring ion leakage from shoots obtained at different time points following TM treatment. For each measurement, shoots from four seedlings were immersed in 4 ml of distilled water in a tissue-culture plate for 6 h at room temperature. After incubation with gentle shaking (100 rpm), the conductivity of the bathing solution was directly measured with a conductivity meter (model 604, VWR Scientific). Measurements for each time point were performed at least in triplicate. Histochemistry and MicroscopyFluorescein diacetate (FDA, Sigma-Aldrich) was used as a fluorescent indicator of cell viability via endogenous esterase activity (34Pullen G.R. Chalmers P.J. Nind A.P. Nairn R.C. J. Immunol. Method. 1981; 43: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Seedlings were stained with 2.5 μgml–1 FDA in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl) for 10 min at room temperature. After washing three times with PBS, root cells were immediately observed under a Leica MZ FLIII stereo fluorescence microscope equipped with an enhanced green fluorescence protein filter set (excitation 470/40 nm, emission 525/50 nm, dichroic 495 nm). For quantification of endogenous esterase activity, fluorometric assay using FDA was used. In brief, total soluble proteins were extracted using PBS buffer, and insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation (20,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). The resulting supernatants were used as samples for direct measurement of esterase activity in vitro. H2O2 was detected by an endogenous peroxidase-dependent in situ histochemical staining procedure using 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB) (35Thordal-Christensen H. Zhang Z. Wei Y. Collinge D.B. Plant J. 1997; 11: 1187-1194Crossref Scopus (2099) Google Scholar). Whole seedlings were placed in a solution containing 1 mg ml–1 DAB (pH 5.5, Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 h at room temperature. The seedlings were washed with water and cleared by boiling for 2 min in alcoholic lactophenol (95% ethanol:lactophenol, 2:1), rinsed in 50% ethanol, followed by distilled water. For whole-mount TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick and labeling) staining, roots were fixed overnight in 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature. Fixed root tissues were washed five times with PBS, treated with Proteinase K (20 μgml–1, Invitrogen) in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) at 37 °C for 30 min, and then washed three times with PBS. TUNEL reaction was performed in a microcentrifuge tube (1.5 ml) using the In Situ cell death detection kit with fluorescein (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To visualize nuclei in root cells, samples were stained using 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Sigma-Aldrich) at 0.5 μgml–1 in 0.1%(v/v) Triton X-100 for 10 min, then washed twice with water. DAPI-stained and TUNEL-positive nuclei were observed under a Leica MZ FLIII stereo fluorescence microscope equipped with a BFP filter set (excitation 390/32 nm, emission 460/50 nm, dichroic 420 nm) and an enhanced green fluorescence protein filter set, respectively. GUS staining was performed as described previously (31Jefferson R.A. Kavanagh T.A. Bevan M.W. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3901-3907Crossref PubMed Scopus (8126) Google Scholar). In brief, materials were stained at 37 °C overnight in 1 mm 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylglucuronic acid, 1 mm potass"
https://openalex.org/W2093810123,"Transporters in the ABCG family appear to be involved in the cellular excretion of cholesterol and other sterols in a cell- and tissue-specific fashion. Overexpression of ATP-binding cassette transporters G1 (Abcg1) and G4 (Abcg4) can promote cellular cholesterol efflux to high-density lipoprotein (HDL), but the in vivo functions of Abcg4 are poorly understood. We used mice with knockouts of Abcg1 or Abcg4 singly or together to further elucidate the function of these transporters. Abcg1 and Abcg4 are highly expressed in the brain and are found in both astrocytes and neurons. Whereas Abcg1(-/-) or Abcg4(-/-) mice showed essentially normal levels of brain sterols, in Abcg1(-/-)/Abcg4(-/-) mice, levels of several sterol intermediates in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, namely desmosterol, lathosterol, and lanosterol, as well as 27-OH cholesterol, were increased 2- to 3-fold. Overexpression of Abcg1 or Abcg4 promoted efflux of desmosterol and cholesterol from cells to HDL, and combined deficiency of these transporters led to defective efflux and accumulation of these sterols in primary astrocytes. Consistent with defective efflux and sterol accumulation, cholesterol biosynthesis was reduced in Abcg1(-/-)/Abcg4(-/-) astrocytes. The accumulation of desmosterol, a known liver-X receptor (LXR) activator, was associated with increased expression of LXR target genes, including ATP-binding cassette transporter A1, and increased apolipoprotein E secretion in Abcg1(-/-)/Abcg4(-/-) astrocytes. Our findings provide the first in vivo demonstration of a role for Abcg4 in sterol efflux in the brain and show that Abcg1 and Abcg4 have overlapping functions in astrocytes, promoting efflux of cholesterol, desmosterol, and possibly other sterol biosynthetic intermediates to HDL."
https://openalex.org/W2135859448,"Overnight operations pose a challenge because our circadian biology promotes sleepiness and dissipates wakefulness at night. Since the circadian effect on cognitive functions magnifies with increasing sleep pressure, cognitive deficits associated with night work are likely to be most acute with extended wakefulness, such as during the transition from a day shift to night shift.To test this hypothesis we measured selective attention (with visual search), vigilance (with Psychomotor Vigilance Task [PVT]) and alertness (with a visual analog scale) in a shift work simulation protocol, which included four day shifts followed by three night shifts. There was a nocturnal decline in cognitive processes, some of which were most pronounced on the first night shift. The nighttime decrease in visual search sensitivity was most pronounced on the first night compared with subsequent nights (p = .04), and this was accompanied by a trend towards selective attention becoming 'fast and sloppy'. The nighttime increase in attentional lapses on the PVT was significantly greater on the first night compared to subsequent nights (p<.05) indicating an impaired ability to sustain focus. The nighttime decrease in subjective alertness was also greatest on the first night compared with subsequent nights (p<.05).These nocturnal deficits in attention and alertness offer some insight into why occupational errors, accidents, and injuries are pronounced during night work compared to day work. Examination of the nighttime vulnerabilities underlying the deployment of attention can be informative for the design of optimal work schedules and the implementation of effective countermeasures for performance deficits during night work."
https://openalex.org/W2078095360,"Axolotls (urodele amphibians) have the unique ability, among vertebrates, to perfectly regenerate many parts of their body including limbs, tail, jaw and spinal cord following injury or amputation. The axolotl limb is the most widely used structure as an experimental model to study tissue regeneration. The process is well characterized, requiring multiple cellular and molecular mechanisms. The preparation phase represents the first part of the regeneration process which includes wound healing, cellular migration, dedifferentiation and proliferation. The redevelopment phase represents the second part when dedifferentiated cells stop proliferating and redifferentiate to give rise to all missing structures. In the axolotl, when a limb is amputated, the missing or wounded part is regenerated perfectly without scar formation between the stump and the regenerated structure. Multiple authors have recently highlighted the similarities between the early phases of mammalian wound healing and urodele limb regeneration. In mammals, one very important family of growth factors implicated in the control of almost all aspects of wound healing is the transforming growth factor-beta family (TGF-beta). In the present study, the full length sequence of the axolotl TGF-beta1 cDNA was isolated. The spatio-temporal expression pattern of TGF-beta1 in regenerating limbs shows that this gene is up-regulated during the preparation phase of regeneration. Our results also demonstrate the presence of multiple components of the TGF-beta signaling machinery in axolotl cells. By using a specific pharmacological inhibitor of TGF-beta type I receptor, SB-431542, we show that TGF-beta signaling is required for axolotl limb regeneration. Treatment of regenerating limbs with SB-431542 reveals that cellular proliferation during limb regeneration as well as the expression of genes directly dependent on TGF-beta signaling are down-regulated. These data directly implicate TGF-beta signaling in the initiation and control of the regeneration process in axolotls."
https://openalex.org/W2048350092,"The Notch signaling pathway is an evolutionarily conserved intercellular signaling module essential for cell fate specification that requires endocytosis of Notch ligands. Structurally distinct E3 ubiquitin ligases, Neuralized (Neur) and Mind bomb (Mib), cooperatively regulate the endocytosis of Notch ligands in Drosophila. However, the respective roles of the mammalian E3 ubiquitin ligases, Neur1, Neur2, Mib1, and Mib2, in mammalian development are poorly understood.Through extensive use of mammalian genetics, here we show that Neur1 and Neur2 double mutants and Mib2(-/-) mice were viable and grossly normal. In contrast, conditional inactivation of Mib1 in various tissues revealed the representative Notch phenotypes: defects of arterial specification as deltalike4 mutants, abnormal cerebellum and skin development as jagged1 conditional mutants, and syndactylism as jagged2 mutants.Our data provide the first evidence that Mib1 is essential for Jagged as well as Deltalike ligand-mediated Notch signaling in mammalian development, while Neur1, Neur2, and Mib2 are dispensable."
https://openalex.org/W2154946227,"The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) ensures correct separation of sister chromatids in somatic cells and provokes a cell cycle arrest in metaphase if one chromatid is not correctly attached to the bipolar spindle. Prolonged metaphase arrest due to overexpression of Mad2 has been shown to be deleterious to the ensuing anaphase, leading to the generation of aneuploidies and tumorigenesis. Additionally, some SAC components are essential for correct timing of prometaphase. In meiosis, we and others have shown previously that the Mad2-dependent SAC is functional during the first meiotic division in mouse oocytes. Expression of a dominant-negative form of Mad2 interferes with the SAC in metaphase I, and a knock-down approach using RNA interference accelerates anaphase onset in meiosis I. To prove unambigiously the importance of SAC control for mammalian female meiosis I we analyzed oocyte maturation in Mad2 heterozygote mice, and in oocytes overexpressing a GFP-tagged version of Mad2. In this study we show for the first time that loss of one Mad2 allele, as well as overexpression of Mad2 lead to chromosome missegregation events in meiosis I, and therefore the generation of aneuploid metaphase II oocytes. Furthermore, SAC control is impaired in mad2+/− oocytes, also leading to the generation of aneuploidies in meiosis I."
https://openalex.org/W1985422736,"In patients with acute respiratory failure, gas exchange is impaired due to the accumulation of fluid in the lung airspaces. This life-threatening syndrome is treated with mechanical ventilation, which is adjusted to maintain gas exchange, but can be associated with the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the lung. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a by-product of cellular energy utilization and its elimination is affected via alveolar epithelial cells. Signaling pathways sensitive to changes in CO2 levels were described in plants and neuronal mammalian cells. However, it has not been fully elucidated whether non-neuronal cells sense and respond to CO2. The Na,K-ATPase consumes approximately 40% of the cellular metabolism to maintain cell homeostasis. Our study examines the effects of increased pCO2 on the epithelial Na,K-ATPase a major contributor to alveolar fluid reabsorption which is a marker of alveolar epithelial function.We found that short-term increases in pCO2 impaired alveolar fluid reabsorption in rats. Also, we provide evidence that non-excitable, alveolar epithelial cells sense and respond to high levels of CO2, independently of extracellular and intracellular pH, by inhibiting Na,K-ATPase function, via activation of PKCzeta which phosphorylates the Na,K-ATPase, causing it to endocytose from the plasma membrane into intracellular pools.Our data suggest that alveolar epithelial cells, through which CO2 is eliminated in mammals, are highly sensitive to hypercapnia. Elevated CO2 levels impair alveolar epithelial function, independently of pH, which is relevant in patients with lung diseases and altered alveolar gas exchange."
https://openalex.org/W2039840615,"Leptin is an adipocyte-derived hormone/cytokine that links nutritional status with neuroendocrine and immune functions. Lipid bodies (lipid droplets) are emerging as dynamic organelles with roles in lipid metabolism and inflammation. Here we investigated the roles of leptin in signaling pathways involved in cytoplasmic lipid body biogenesis and leukotriene B4 synthesis in macrophages. Our results demonstrated that leptin directly activated macrophages and induced the formation of adipose differentiation-related protein-enriched lipid bodies. Newly formed lipid bodies were sites of 5-lipoxygenase localization and correlated with an enhanced capacity of leukotriene B4 production. We demonstrated that leptin-induced macrophage activation was dependent on phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) activity, since the lipid body formation was inhibited by LY294002 and was absent in the PI3K knock-out mice. Leptin induces phosphorylation of p70S6K and 4EBP1 key downstream signaling intermediates of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway in a rapamycin-sensitive mechanism. The mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin, inhibited leptin-induced lipid body formation, both in vivo and in vitro. In addition, rapamycin inhibited leptin-induced adipose differentiation-related protein accumulation in macrophages and lipid body-dependent leukotriene synthesis, demonstrating a key role for mTOR in lipid body biogenesis and function.

Leptin-induced increased formation of cytoplasmic lipid bodies and enhanced inflammatory mediator production in macrophages may have implications for obesity-related cardiovascular diseases. All organisms have evolved systems to sense nutrient availability and transduce this information into changes in metabolic pathways and networks. In vertebrates, a complex physiological system regulates fuel stores and energy expenditure. Leptin, a hormone/cytokine mainly secreted by adipocytes, is an important component of this system (1Friedman J.M. Halaas J.L. Nature. 1998; 395: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (4541) Google Scholar, 2Spiegelman B.M. Flier J.S. Cell. 2001; 104: 531-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1958) Google Scholar). Leptin was described initially by its properties of inhibiting feeding and increasing energy expenditure mainly by actions on the hypothalamic axis (1Friedman J.M. Halaas J.L.

In addition, leptin can act as an early acute phase reactant; it is produced in high levels during inflammatory conditions and is capable of modulating the innate and adaptive immune responses (3Lam Q.L.

Formation of lipid-laden foam cells is a key event in early atherogenesis, which contributes to the formation of atherosclerotic plaques. Although leptin has demonstrated effects in lipid metabolism in adipocytes, their roles in macrophages in regulating lipid accumulation and foam cell formation are not well understood. Lipid-laden macrophage foam cell formation involves complex and multistep mechanisms that depend on different signaling pathways regulating lipid influx, metabolization, storage, and mobilization (11Li A.C. Glass C.K. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1235-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). Accumulating data suggest that leptin may differentially regulate intracellular lipid storage in adipocytes and macrophages. Indeed, leptin regulates key enzymes involved in lipid metabolism in macrophages, including hormone-sensitive lipase, acyl COA: cholesterol acyl transferase, and neutral cholesteryl esterase, suggesting that leptin may favor lipid accumulation in macrophages (12O'Rourke L.

In different cell types, including macrophages, intracellular lipids are stored and metabolized in hydrophobic organelles called lipid bodies or lipid droplets. The accumulation of lipids in these lipid bodies is of major interest for the study of atherosclerosis, obesity, and other inflammatory diseases. Cytoplasmic lipid bodies are osmiophilic structures surrounded by a phospholipid monolayer with a unique fatty acid composition and a neutral lipid rich core and contain a variable protein composition (13Tauchi-Sato K.

ADRP is a member of the PAT family (perilipin, ADRP, TIP47) of proteins and plays an important role in adipocyte differentiation. More recently, it has been associated with increased lipid accumulation in lipid bodies and considered to play an active role on the lipid body assembling and lipolysis modulation (15Larigauderie G.

Moreover, a number of enzymes and signaling proteins were shown to be associated with lipid bodies, including fatty acid metabolic enzymes, eicosanoid-forming enzymes, specific kinases, and small GTPases (20Dvorak A.M.

Therefore, lipid bodies are now viewed as dynamic organelles for integrating lipid metabolism, inflammatory mediator production, membrane trafficking, and intracellular signaling (28Martin S.

The direct role of leptin in macrophage lipid metabolism and foam cell formation has not been well established. Here we investigated the ability of leptin to trigger lipid body biogenesis and the LTB4 synthetic function of macrophage lipid bodies. Leptin effects on lipid body formation and LTB4 generation are strictly dependent on PI3K and mTOR. Our results demonstrate new activities of leptin in inflammation and lipid metabolism and establish new signaling pathways for leptin in macrophages. Materials—Murine recombinant leptin was purchased from Sigma and from Peprotech (London, UK) and was devoid of LPS contamination, as attested by the fabricants and demonstrated by LAL (<0.01 EU/ml). Calcium ionophore A23187 was obtained from Calbiochem. LY294002 and rapamycin were from Sigma. Animals—C57Bl/6, C3H/HeJ, and C3H/HeN male mice were from the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation Breeding Unit and were raised and maintained under controlled housing conditions. PI3Kγ-deficient mice were obtained in sv129 mice as described (30Sasaki T. Irie-Sasaki J. Jones R.G. Oliveira-dos-Santos A.J. Stanford W.L. Bolon B. Wakeham A. Itie A. Bouchard D. Kozieradzki I. Joza N. Mak T.W. Ohashi P.S. Suzuki A. Penninger J.M. Science. 2000; 287: 1040-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar) and were back-crossed until the 5th generation in C57Bl/6 background. The sv129xC57Bl/6 mixed wild type and C57Bl/6 were used as wild type controls. No differences between C57Bl/6 and the mixed background (sv129xC57Bl/6) in leptin response were observed (not shown). Animals were maintained and treated according to the animal care guidelines, in accordance to the National Institutes of Health recommendations. The Oswaldo Cruz Animal Welfare Committee approved all protocols used in this study. In Vivo Peritoneal Stimuli—The intraperitoneal administration of leptin (0.25, 0.5, 1, or 2 mg/kg) or vehicle (sterile saline) in a final volume of 0.1 ml was used in the in vivo experiments. Animals were killed in a CO2 chamber at different time points (1, 6, and 24 h) after leptin administration. The peritoneal cavity was rinsed with 3 ml of Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS). Total leukocyte counts were performed in Neubauer chambers, and differential leukocyte counts were performed on cytospin smears after May-Grünwald-Giemsa. Alternatively, animals received three intraperitoneal injections of rapamycin (15 μg/kg) or vehicle, in a final volume of 50 μl, 12 h and 15 min before and 12 h after the injection of leptin or saline. The peritoneal wash was analyzed at the 24 h time point of leptin administration. In Vitro Peritoneal Macrophage Stimulation—Peritoneal macrophages (>90% macrophages) were collected by rinsing the peritoneal cavity from naive mice with 4 ml of cold HBSS. Macrophages (106 cells/ml) were stimulated with leptin (20 nm) or vehicle for 30 min or 4 h in RPMI medium with 2% fetal bovine serum. In designated groups, cells were pretreated with LY294002 (0.5 μm) or rapamycin (20 nm) 30 min before the addition of the stimuli. Cell viability was always greater than 85%, as determined by trypan blue dye exclusion at the end of each experiment. Lipid Body Staining and Counting—While still moist, leukocytes on cytospin slides were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in HBSS (pH 7.4) and were stained with osmium tetroxide, Oil Red O, or BODIPY® 493/503 (4,4-difluoro-1,3,5,7,8-pentamethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene). For the osmium staining, the slides were rinsed in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, incubated with 1.5% OsO4 (30 min), rinsed in H2O, immersed in 1.0% thiocarbohydrazide (5 min), rinsed in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, reincubated in 1.5% OsO4 (3 min), rinsed in distilled water, and then dried for further analysis. The morphology of fixed cells was observed, and lipid bodies were enumerated by light microscopy with a ×100 objective lens in 50 consecutive leukocytes in each slide. The person responsible for counting was blinded to the codes for each slide. Slides were alternatively stained with Oil Red O or BODIPY, evidencing the accumulation of neutral lipids in lipid bodies. The measurement of the area of lipid bodies was done with the BODIPY fluorescent images, obtained with a ×60 objective (at least four fields per slide). The images were transformed into black and white pictures and analyzed with Image 2D (GE Healthcare). The spots were determined by automatic spot detection, and the total area of fluorescent lipid bodies was obtained for each field and divided by the number of cells in the respective field. Western Blotting—Cell lysates were prepared in reducing and denaturing conditions and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Samples were submitted to electrophoresis in 5–15% acrylamide gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After transfer onto nitrocellulose membranes, nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline-Tween (TBST; 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20). Membranes were probed with anti-ADRP polyclonal antibody (Research Diagnostics Inc., Flanders, NJ), anti-phospho-p70S6K or anti-phospho-4EBP1 (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), or anti-β-actin monoclonal antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories) in TBST with 1% nonfat dry milk. Proteins of interest were then identified by incubating the membrane with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies in TBST, followed by detection of antigen-antibody complexes by Supersignal chemiluminescence (Pierce). The detection was done by exposing the membrane to autoradiography film, or the luminescence was captured on the Typhoon blot imager (GE Healthcare). For the densitometry analysis, the Typhoon images or the images from developed films were analyzed in the software Image 2D (GE Healthcare). The spotting and the analysis parameters were performed by a colleague blind to sample identity. Immunolocalization—Cells were recovered from leptin- or saline-injected mice (24 h), and cytospin smears were immediately fixed in 3% formaldehyde for 10 min. After permeabilization in 0.2% Triton X-100 for 20 min at room temperature, slides were washed twice in Ca2+/Mg2+-free HBSS. Cell preparations were then incubated with polyclonal antibody anti-5-LO (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI) for 30 min, followed by incubation with anti-ADRP polyclonal antibody (Research Diagnostics Inc., Flanders, NJ) antibody for an additional 30 min at room temperature. As control for the anti-5-LO, normal rabbit serum was used in separate slides. The cells were washed twice in Ca2+/Mg2+-free HBSS for 10 min and incubated with secondary antibodies Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-guinea pig IgG and Cy2-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Imunoresearch). Slides were then washed with HBSS and mounted with an aqueous mounting medium (Vectashield; Vector, Burlingame, CA). Slides were viewed by both phase-contrast and fluorescence microscopy, and digital images were obtained using a Hoper Scientific digital camera with the Image-Express software. LTB4 Assay—The peritoneal cells were resuspended (106 cells/ml) in HBSS containing Ca2+-Mg2+ and then stimulated with A23187 (0.5 μm) for 15 min. Reactions were stopped on ice, and the supernatant was obtained after centrifugation at 500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. LTB4 was assayed by an enzyme immunoassay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Cayman Chemical). Statistical Analysis—Data were reported as the mean ± S.E. and were analyzed statistically by means of analysis of variance followed by Newman-Keuls-Student's test or Student's t test with the level of significance set at p < 0.05. Leptin Triggers Biogenesis of ADRP-enriched Lipid Bodies within Macrophages—Lipid bodies in leukocytes and other cell systems are increasingly recognized as organelles with key roles in lipid metabolism, signaling compartmentalization, and inflammation (28Martin S. Parton R.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 7: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar, 29Bozza P.T. Melo R.C. Bandeira-Melo C. Pharmacol. Ther. 2007; 113: 30-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Leptin activates cells of the immune system and modulates cellular lipid metabolism and storage (3Lam Q.L. Lu L. Cell Mol. Immunol. 2007; 4: 1-13PubMed Google Scholar, 4La Cava A. Matarese G. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 371-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). We hypothesized a role for leptin in regulating macrophage lipid body biogenesis and functions. As shown in Fig. 1A, leptin-induced lipid body biogenesis in macrophages as seen by osmium (OsO4), oil red O (ORO), and BODIPY staining of the cells collected from the peritoneal cavity. The increase in lipid bodies was significant within 6 h and maximum within 24 h after peritoneal injection (Fig. 1B). In addition, BODIPY-labeled lipid bodies were quantitated by densitometric image analysis as a measure of lipid body area and neutral lipid accumulation per cell, confirming the effect of leptin in inducing lipid body biogenesis within 24 h (Fig. 1C). Although intraperitoneal administration of leptin induced significant recruitment of neutrophils to the peritoneal cavity, these neutrophils were not stimulated to form lipid bodies (Fig. 1A). Leptin also induced lipid body formation in peritoneal macrophages stimulated in vitro (control, 2.51 ± 0.49; leptin, 6.53 ± 0.88; p < 0.01, n = 6–8), pointing to a direct effect of leptin on macrophages. TLR4-dependent signaling has been implicated in obesity and insulin resistance (31Tsukumo D.M. Carvalho-Filho M.A. Carvalheira J.B. Prada P.O. Hirabara S.M. Schenka A.A. Araujo E.P. Vassalo J. Curi R. Velloso L.A. Saad M.J. Diabetes. 2007; 56: 1986-1998Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). We excluded the possibility that the observed effects of leptin on macrophage lipid body formation could involve TLR4 or was due to LPS contamination. For this experiment, we used a TLR4-defective LPS-hyporesponsive mouse strain, C3H/HeJ, that is unable to form new lipid bodies when treated with LPS (32Pacheco P. Bozza F.A. Gomes R.N. Bozza M. Weller P.F. Castro-Faria-Neto H.C. Bozza P.T. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 6498-6506Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The intraperitoneal injection of leptin in C3H/HeJ mice led to significant macrophage lipid body formation within 24 h (control, 3.28 ± 1.18; leptin, 7.47 ± 1.89; p < 0.05). Moreover leptin samples were negative for LPS contamination in the LAL test (<0.01 EU/ml), indicating that LPS is not involved in the observed leptin response. Next, we investigated the effects of leptin in ADRP expression. There is great interest in the regulation of ADRP as a key event on both adipocyte differentiation and macrophage foam cell formation. ADRP is a structural protein that surrounds lipid bodies in different cell types (17Brasaemle D.L. Barber T. Wolins N.E. Serrero G. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Londos C. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2249-2263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), including macrophages (15Larigauderie G. Furman C. Jaye M. Lasselin C. Copin C. Fruchart J.C. Castro G. Rouis M.

Immunol. 2006; 176: 3087-3097Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Leptin-induced lipid body accumulation in peritoneal macrophages stimulated in vivo for 24 h was accompanied by an enhanced ADRP content in these cells (Fig. 2). The comparison between control and leptin by immunofluorescence images (Fig. 2A) and Western blotting (Fig. 2B) shows a concentration-dependent accumulation of ADRP on leptin-stimulated macrophages (Fig. 2B). Leptin Induces Time- and Concentration-dependent Priming for LTB4 Production and 5-LO Localization in Lipid Bodies—Macrophage lipid bodies are sites of intracellular localization of leukotriene-forming enzymes, store arachidonic acid, and are sites for eicosanoid synthesis (22Yu W. Bozza P.T. Tzizik D.M. Gray J.P. Cassara J. Dvorak A.M. Weller P.F. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 152: 759-769PubMed Google Scholar, 32Pacheco P. Bozza F.A. Gomes R.N. Bozza M. Weller P.F.

Bozza P.T. J. Immunol. 2006; 176: 3087-3097Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). We analyzed whether leptin-induced increase in lipid body is associated with LTB4 production (Fig. 3). After macrophages were elicited in vivo with leptin, lipid bodies were enumerated, and the isolated leukocytes were stimulated with the calcium ionophore, A23187 (0.5 μm). Leptin-induced priming for enhanced LTB4 generation was concordant with the increases in lipid body numbers and presented an identical temporal sequence (r = 0.97; p < 0.001) (Fig. 3A). The capacity for synthesizing PGE2 was also enhanced by leptin (saline, 9.4 ± 1.7 ng/ml; leptin, 26.7 ± 4.2 ng/ml). Leptin-induced lipid body formation and priming for LTB4 generation occur in a dose-dependent manner, significant with 0.5 mg/kg and maximum after 2 mg/kg of leptin within 24 h (Fig. 3B). We investigated the capacity of leptin-induced macrophage lipid bodies to compartmentalize the leukotriene-synthesizing enzyme 5-lipoxygenase. We analyzed the intracellular compartmentalization of 5-LO by immunofluorescence, employing conditions of leukocyte fixation and permeabilization that prevent dissolution of lipid bodies. Macrophages stained with rabbit polyclonal antibody to 5-LO showed punctate cytoplasmic localizations fully consistent in size, form, number, and distribution of lipid bodies (Fig. 3C). Leptin-induced 5-LO localization within cytoplasmic lipid bodies was confirmed by co-localization of 5-LO with ADRP (Fig. 3C). Only ADRP was detected when control nonimmune rabbit serum was used as control for 5-LO antibody (not shown). Leptin-induced Macrophage Activation Is Dependent on the PI3K Pathway—As shown in Fig. 4A, LY294002 completely abrogated leptin-induced lipid body formation in peritoneal macrophages stimulated in vitro. To determine the role of PI3Kγ in the macrophage activation induced by leptin, we examined lipid body formation in wild type mice or mice genetically deficient in PI3Kγ 24 h after leptin intraperitoneal administration. Leptin-induced macrophage lipid body formation in vivo in the peritoneal cavity was completely abolished in PI3Kγ-/- mice in comparison with wild type control animals (Fig. 4B). These in vivo and in vitro results identify PI3Kγ as a critical signaling pathway in leptin-induced macrophage activation. Leptin-induced Lipid Body Formation Depends on Mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR)—The mTOR pathway integrates insulin and nutrient signaling in numerous cell types and the main upstream signaling mechanism for mTOR activation involves PI3K pathway (34Wullschleger S. Loewith R. Hall M.N. Cell. 2006; 124: 471-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4745) Google Scholar). Leptin levels are regulated by nutritional status and are reduced during starvation (1Friedman J.M. Halaas J.L. Nature. 1998; 395: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (4541) Google Scholar). Recent studies show that activation of the mTOR pathway is decreased during starvation and increased in high fat-fed obese animals and that mTOR is involved with the leptin effects on hypothalamus (35Khamzina L. Veilleux A. Bergeron S. Marette A. Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 1473-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 36Cota D. Proulx K. Smith K.A. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Woods S.C. Seeley R.J. Science. 2006; 312: 927-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar). Although inflammatory responses are activated within these conditions, the role of mTOR in leptin-induced effects on leukocyte function has never been addressed. To investigate the functional role of mTOR activation in leptin-induced macrophage activation, we employed rapamycin, a specific inhibitor and probe for mTOR activity (37Shamji A.F. Nghiem P. Schreiber S.L. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 271-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). We performed both in vitro and in vivo experiments using the previous described protocols for leptin stimuli in the presence of rapamycin. Rapamycin pretreatment inhibited lipid body formation in peritoneal macrophage stimulated by leptin in vitro (Fig. 5A). The p70S6K and 4EBP1 are the main downstream proteins that are phosphorylated by mTOR and activate the translation initiation by activation of the S6 protein and release of the eIF4E, respectively (38Sarbassov D.D. Guertin D.A. Ali S.M. Sabatini D.M. Science. 2005; 307: 1098-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (5294) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5B, leptin induced a time-dependent phosphorylation of p70S6K and 4EBP1 in macrophages in vitro. Leptin-induced p70S6K phosphorylation in vitro was inhibited by the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 and by rapamycin (Fig. 5C). The intraperitoneal administration of rapamycin also completely inhibited lipid body formation after 24-h treatment with leptin in vivo (Fig. 6A). This effect was accompanied by an inhibition in the capacity for LTB4 production (Fig. 6B), reinforcing the importance of the mTOR pathway on the eicosanoid production upon leptin stimuli. Moreover, Western blotting of macrophage lysates obtained from in vivo leptin-stimulated animals showed an inhibition of ADRP protein accumulation by rapamycin (Fig. 6, C and D). These data suggest that leptin-mediated biogenesis of ADRP-enriched lipid bod"

We investigated the actions of PGE2 on microvascular endothelial cells (capillary venular endothelial cells) with the purpose of delineating the signaling pathway leading to the acquisition of the angiogenic phenotype and to new vessel formation. PGE2 (100 nm) produced activation of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR-1), as measured by its phosphorylation, but not of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2. PGE2 stimulated the EP3 subtype receptor, as deduced by abrogation of EP3 Gαi subunit activity through pertussis toxin. Consistent with this result, in human umbilical venular endothelial cells missing the EP3 receptor, PGE2 did not phosphorylate FGFR-1. Upon binding to its receptor, PGE2 initiated an autocrine/paracrine signaling cascade involving the intracellular activation of c-Src, activation of matrix metalloproteinase (predominantly MMP2), which in turn caused the mobilization of membrane-anchored fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2). In fact, in cells unable to release FGF-2 the transfection with both FGFR-1 and EP3 did not result in FGFR-1 phosphorylation in response to PGE2. Relevance for the FGF2-FGFR-1 system was highlighted by confocal analysis, showing receptor internalization after cell exposure to the prostanoid. ERK1/2 appeared to be the distal signal involved, its phosphorylation being sensitive to either cSrc inhibitor or FGFR-1 blocker. Finally, PGE2 stimulated cell migration and capillary formation in aortic rings, which were severely reduced by inhibitors of signaling molecules or by receptor antagonist. In conclusion, this study provides evidence for the involvement of FGFR-1 through FGF2 in eliciting PGE2 angiogenic responses. This signaling pattern is similar to the autocrine-paracrine mechanism which operates in endothelial cells to support neovascular growth.

This notion has been established by experimental studies which show increased expression of cyclooxygenase isoforms (COX-1 and COX-2) as well as enhanced levels of PGE2, the major product of their enzyme activity, in several tumor tissues (i.e. colon and breast tumors) (1Wang D.

A wealth of experimental studies has delineated the molecular mechanisms utilized by PGE2 to induce tumor proliferation. PGE2 upon binding to its membrane receptor, belonging to the classical G protein-coupled receptor family, activates a signal cascade that through a complex array of intermediate steps (c-Src, PKC, Pyk2), leads to the extracellular release of peptide ligands stimulating growth factor receptors and producing tumor growth (5Gschwind A. Zwick E. Prenzel N. Leserer M. Ullrich A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1595-1600Crossref Scopus (414) Google Scholar). In parallel, PGE2 transactivates the EGF receptor (EGFR) via an intracellular phosphorylation cascade involving the protooncogene c-Src, which magnifies the EGF tumorigenic drive (6Pai R. Soreghan B.

Complementing its tumor promoting activity, PGE2 has been found to activate tumor angiogenesis, thus providing for the blood supply needs of proliferating tumors (1Wang D. DuBois R.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 415-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Experimental evidence shows that the overexpression of cyclooxygenase-2, which characterizes many epithelial tumors as well as their endothelial population, is accompanied by enhanced expression and production of angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF), fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), hypoxia-inducible factor-1, matrix-degrading enzymes (e.g. matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)), vascular remodeling ligands (i.e. angiopoietins), and adhesion receptors of the integrin families (9Mohammed S.I.

Indeed, it appears that in experimental breast tumors, characterized by high output of PGE2 through forced expression of cyclooxygenase-2, angiogenesis proceeds tumor development (16Chang S.H. Liu C.H. Conway R. Han D.K. Nithipatikom K. Trifan O.C. Lane T.F. Hla T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 591-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Thus, the concept that PGE2 is capable to drive tumor angiogenesis is now firmly grounded. Numerous clinical investigations conducted either as population studies or specific investigations on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which produce a decrease of PGE2 tissue level through blockade of cyclooxygenase-2, have further established the crucial role of prostanoid in angiogenesis, since most angiogenic markers examined were definitely down-regulated, and tumor progression was halted (1Wang D. DuBois R.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 415-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Although the action of PGE2 on tumor-associated angiogenesis appears well documented, much less is known about the activity of the prostanoid on the angiogenic process outside of the context of tumor growth. Previous reports indicated that PGE2 induces directly endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and tube formation (17Namkoong S. Lee S.J. Kim C.K. Kim Y.M. Chung H.T. Lee H. Han J.A. Ha K.S.

In particular it has been demonstrated that PGE2 induces angiogenesis after activation of EP2 and EP4 receptors in human vascular endothelial cells (17Namkoong S. Lee S.J. Kim C.K. Kim Y.M.

EP2 or EP4 activation induces an increase of intracellular levels of cAMP and ERK1/2, linked to different signaling pathways. Recently, Rao et al. (18Rao R. Redha R. Macias-Perez I. Su Y. Hwang M.T.

Chem. 2007; 282: 16959-16968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) demonstrated that EP4 receptor plays a critical role in PGE2-dependent in vitro migration and tubulogenesis that is mediated by activation of ERK1/2 pathway. Moreover, Kamoshita et al. (19Kamoshita E. Ikeda Y. Fujita M. Amano H. Oikawa A. Suzuki T. Ogawa Y. Yamashina S. Azuma S. Narumiya S. Unno N. Majima M. Am. J.

Finally, Namkoong et al. (17Namkoong S. Lee S.J. Kim C.K. Kim Y.M. Chung H.T. Lee H. Han J.A. Ha K.S. Kwon Y.G. Kim Y.M. Exp. Mol. Med. 2005; 37: 588-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) demonstrated that pharmacological inhibition of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) pathway inhibits PGE2-induced proliferation in in vitro cultured endothelial cells and that in eNOS-deficient mice the formation of capillary-like structure on aortic rings is abolished. Moreover, FGF-2 and VEGF, two effective pro-angiogenic growth factors, induce angiogenesis through increasing expression of cyclooxygenases and PGE2 production (20Hernandez G.L. Volpert O.V.

However, the functional and molecular mechanisms necessary for PGE2-induced angiogenesis are not completely understood. In this work we have investigated the action of PGE2 on microvascular endothelial cells examining both their functional properties relevant for angiogenesis (migration and ability to form pseudocapillaries) and signals involved in producing the angiogenic phenotype, such as activation of ERK1/2 and of the growth factor receptor, FGFR-1. Cell Line and Culture Conditions—Post-capillary venular endothelial cells (CVEC) were obtained and cultured as previously described (22Schelling M.E. Meininger C.J. Hawker Jr., J.R. Granger H.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 254: H1211-H1217PubMed Google Scholar). Cardiac-derived human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC-C) and human umbilical venular endothelial cells were purchased from Cambrex and maintained in Endothelial Cell Basal Medium-2 with growth supplements. Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with FGFR-1 (CHO/FGFR-1) were provided by Prof. M. Presta (University of Brescia, Brescia, Italy) and cultured as previously described (23Casu B. Guerrini M. Naggi A. Perez M. Torri G. Ribatti D. Carminati P. Giannini G. Penco S. Pisano C. Belleri M. Rusnati M. Presta M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10519-10528Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Cell Migration—Chemotaxis experiments were performed with the Boyden chamber technique as previously described (24Morbidelli L. Donnini S. Chillemi F. Giachetti A. Ziche M. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 358-369Google Scholar). Endothelial cells were treated for 30 min with U0126 (10 nm), PP1 (500 nm), GM6001 (25 μm), or SU5402 (10 μm), and then 1.25 × 104 cells were added to the upper wells of the chamber. PGE2 (100 nm) was used as chemoattractant. Western Blot—Cells (3 × 105) were seeded in 60-mm-diameter dishes. Cells were stimulated with 100 nm PGE2. To assess the effects of FGFR1 and c-Src inhibitors on ERK1/2 phosphorylation, cells were pretreated with SU5402 (10 μm) or PP1 (500 nm). To evaluate the expression of EP receptors in CHO-FGFR1 transfected with EPs, 8 × 105 cells were seeded in 100-mm-diameter dishes, and after 24 h cells were analyzed by Western blotting. Western blot was performed as previously described (25Donnini S. Morbidelli L. Taraboletti G. Ziche M. Life Sci. 2004; 74: 2975-2985Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation—Cells were stimulated with PGE2 (100 nm) or FGF-2 (20 ng/ml) for 15 min. Where indicated, cells were pretreated with the anti-FGF-2 neutralizing antibody (6 μg/ml), PP1 (500 nm), GM6001 (25 μm), or MMP-2 inhibitor (25 μm) for 30 min and with pertussis toxin (300 ng/ml) for 18 h. EP receptor agonists (100 nm), adenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate, N6,O2 dibutyryl-sodium salt (cAMP analogue, 10 μm), or A23187 (50 ng/ml) were added to the cells for 15 min. Anti-FGFR-1 or anti VEGFR-2 antibody were added to the precleared lysates (100 μl, Sigma). Western blot was performed as previously described (25Donnini S. Morbidelli L. Taraboletti G. Ziche M. Life Sci. 2004; 74: 2975-2985Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Gelatin Zymography—6 × 103 cells/well were cultured in 96-well cell culture plates in 10% fetal calf serum medium. After adhesion, cells were washed with and incubated in serum-free medium for 18 h. 100 nm PGE2 were added in 50 μl of fresh serum-free medium. After 18 h of incubation, the conditioned medium was collected, clarified by centrifugation, and assayed for zymography as described (25Donnini S. Morbidelli L. Taraboletti G. Ziche M. Life Sci. 2004; 74: 2975-2985Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemistry—25 × 103 CVEC cells were seeded on cover slides in a 24-multiwell plate. Cells were starved for 24 h and then stimulated with FGF-2 20 ng/ml or PGE2 100 nm for 15 min. After the stimulation the cells were fixed in paraformaldehyde for 5 min and then washed in PBS with Ca2+ and Mg2+. Cells were then permeabilized in 0.25% Tween 20 in PBS for 10 min. After the blocking of unspecific bindings in 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 30 min, the cells were incubated with a monoclonal mouse anti FGFR1 antibody (Upstate) diluted 1:25 in 0.5% BSA in PBS for 18 h at 4 °C. Cells were then washed and incubated with a goat fluorescein isothiocyanate anti-mouse Ig G (Sigma) diluted 1:100 for 1 h. The cells counterstained with propidium iodide (1.5 mm) were also pretreated with 100 μg/ml DNase-free RNase. Heparin Binding—10 μl of heparin-acrylic beads were incubated with increasing concentration of PGE2 (100 nm to 10 μm) in 40 μl of PBS for 1 h at 37 °C. Then 25 ng of FGF-2 was added and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. Beads were then washed with PBS, and bound FGF-2 was removed by boiling with sample buffer. The solution was analyzed by SDS, 8% polyacrylamide gel. Western blots for FGF-2 were performed as described (26Donnini S. Cantara S. Morbidelli L. Giachetti A. Ziche M. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 1088-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Cell Transfection—Subconfluent CHO-FGFR-1 were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 1% fetal calf serum with 6 μg of prostaglandin E receptor 1, 2, 3, or 4 subtype encoding plasmids or empty plasmid (pcDNA3.1) and 6 μl of Lipofectamine for 18 h and then cultured in fresh medium for 24 h before use in experiments. Endothelial Tube Formation from Aortic Rings—Pseudocapillary sprouting from vessel rings was evaluated as previously described (25Donnini S. Morbidelli L. Taraboletti G. Ziche M. Life Sci. 2004; 74: 2975-2985Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Stimuli were tested at 20 ng/ml FGF-2 or 100 nm PGE2. In experiments aimed at evaluating the role of FGFR-1, the selective inhibitor SU5402 (10 μm) was added together with PGE2. The area occupied by pseudocapillary structures was quantified by an inverted microscope at a magnification of 200× using an ocular grid. The area is expressed as the number of grid units required to cover the entire pseudocapillary surface. Reagents—Reagents for cell cultures, PGE2, misoprostol, heparin-acrylic beads, pertussis toxin, A23187, and heparinase were obtained from Sigma; U0126, SU5402, SU5614, PP1 GM6001, and MMP-2 inhibitor-I were from Calbiochem-Novabiochem; FGF-2 was from Peprotech. Anti-phospho-ERK1/2, anti-ERK1/2, and anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling; anti-FGF-2 neutralizing, anti-FGFR-1, or anti-VEGFR-2, and anti-FGF-2 antibodies were from Upstate; anti-β-actin was from Sigma. Plasmids encoding for EP1, EP2, EP3, or EP4 receptors (PTGER1, PTGER2, PTGEE3, and PTGER4) were from UMR cDNA Resource Center, University of Missouri-Rolla. Statistics—Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test for unpaired data or by analysis of variance; p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Prostaglandin E2 Induces Endothelial Cell Migration and New Vessel Formation through FGFR-1 Activation—The proangiogenic properties of PGE2 have been documented in several reports describing its effects either on the in vivo formation of new vessels or on cultured endothelial cells measuring functional responses (proliferation, migration) (17Namkoong S. Lee S.J. Kim C.K. Kim Y.M. Chung H.T. Lee H. Han J.A. Ha K.S. Kwon Y.G. Kim Y.M. Exp. Mol. Med. 2005; 37: 588-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 18Rao R. Redha R. Macias-Perez I. Su Y.

This work focuses on signaling mechanisms underlying the angiogenic actions exerted by PGE2 on cultured microvascular endothelial cells. First, we analyzed the chemotactic activity of PGE2 by measuring cell migration after incubation of quiescent endothelial cells with increasing concentrations of the prostanoid (1-1000 nm for 4 h). The observed response to PGE2 was concentration-related, maximal effect being reached at 100 nm (a concentration used throughout this work). Misoprostol, a metabolically stable PGE2 analogue, reproduced the effect of the natural ligand, suggesting that PGE2 is stable under the conditions used, and its effects may not be attributed to its derivative products (Fig. 1A). In light of these results we wondered whether PGE2 activity might involve canonical pathways of angiogenesis such as those elicited by the FGF-2 or the VEGF. We, therefore, measured PGE2-induced cell migration in the presence of antagonists of their respective receptors (FGFR-1 and VEGFR-2). Indeed, FGFR-1 blockade by SU5402 (10 μm) abolished cell migration, whereas application of SU5614 (10 μm), a blocker of VEGFR-2, did not modify PGE2 action (Fig. 1B). The PGE2 pro-angiogenic activity was also analyzed in mouse aorta explants, a vascular organ culture representing an integrated system for assessing angiogenesis. As shown in Fig. 2, PGE2 produced the formation of a rich network of capillary-like structures in mouse aorta explants. The magnitude of the PGE2 response was comparable with that promoted by the angiogenic factor FGF-2 (Fig. 2, A, B, C, and F). SU5402, (10 μm), the selective FGFR-1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor, abolished PGE2-induced capillary sprouting (Fig. 2, D-F), whereas SU5614, the VEGFR-2 inhibitor, was devoid of any effect (not shown). To investigate the selectivity of FGFR-1 activation by PGE2, mouse aortic explants were pretreated with SU5402 and stimulated with selective thromboxane-A and PGI2 agonists (U4699 and Iloprost at 100 nm, respectively). Iloprost induced the formation of capillary-like structures, which were unaffected by FGFR-1 inhibition, whereasU4699 was not able to promote neovessel growth in this experimental model (data not shown). Collectively, these findings clearly indicate that FGFR-1 activation selectively conveys PGE2 mitogenic signals in the vascular endothelium, promoting its activation and migratory behavior. PGE2 Promotes FGFR-1 Activation—To determine the direct involvement of FGFR-1 in the above described responses, we examined whether PGE2 could stimulate its phosphorylation. Activation of FGFR-1 was evaluated by the immunoprecipitation of the receptor followed by Western blotting analysis with phosphotyrosine-specific antibody. PGE2 treatment of endothelial cells induced rapid FGFR-1 phosphorylation (2-fold increase over basal), detectable within 10 min (not shown) and sustained through 15 min of incubation (Fig. 3A). FGF-2 at a fully competent concentration of 20 ng/ml produced a slightly more intense FGFR-1 phosphorylation (3-fold over basal). We confirmed this finding by using a different approach. We studied the perinuclear translocation of FGFR-1 in response to PGE2, a known mechanism linked to tyrosine kinase receptor activation (29Sorensen V. Nilsen T. Wiedlocha A. BioEssays. 2006; 28: 504-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The addition of PGE2 to the medium promoted within minutes (15 min) translocation of FGFR-1 from the membrane/cytoplasm to the perinuclear area (Fig. 3C), thus reproducing the receptor internalization observed with the natural ligand FGF-2 (Fig. 3D). To better analyze this phenomenon we used confocal microscopy using a nuclear marker (propidium iodide). As shown in Fig. 3E, PGE2 or FGF-2 resulted in internalization of FGFR-1 in perinuclear area (see panel 3 versus 6 and 9). FGFR-1 activation was clearly specific, as the prostanoid failed to promote VEGFR-2 phosphorylation (Fig. 3F). Phosphorylation of FGFR-1 by PGE2 Requires the Activation of c-Src—To delineate the mechanism of FGFR-1 activation, we first investigated whether PGE2 would directly bind to the receptor by using CHO cells overexpressing FGFR-1 but lacking EP receptors. Exposure of CHO/FGFR-1 to PGE2 failed to induce FGFR-1 phosphorylation (Fig. 4A). Because PGE2 has been reported to activate c-Src in tumor cells and c-Src has been shown to serve as a signaling mediator both downstream and upstream of growth factor receptor activation (7Buchanan F.G. Wang D. Bargiacchi F. DuBois R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35451-35457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 30Bromann P.A. Korkaya H. Courtneidge S.A. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 7957-7968Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), we determined whether PGE2 activates c-Src in endothelial cells and whether its activation lies upstream of the FGFR-1. PGE2 promoted a robust (nearly 4-fold increase over basal) c-Src phosphorylation (Fig. 4B). We then evaluated the influence of c-Src on the PGE2-induced FGFR-1 activation by measuring its phosphorylation in the presence of PP1, a known c-Src inhibitor, in comparison to that of SU5402. Because both compounds inhibited FGFR-1 phosphorylation to a similar extent, we conclude that PGE2 activates FGFR-1 through a c-Src-dependent mechanism that appears to be upstream to the growth factor receptor activation (Fig. 4C). PGE2 Activates FGFR-1 through an FGF-2 Mobilization Mechanism—We then examined the possibility that the prostanoid might act through the extracellular shedding of FGF-2 by the sequential stimulation of c-Src and matrix metalloproteinases. To determine whetherFGF-2 might have a role in the activation of FGFR-1 by PGE2, we used a non-permeant neutralizing antibody for FGF-2 and measured the phosphorylation of FGFR-1 in response to PGE2. Application of the antibody to endothelial cells 30 min before challenge with PGE2 (15 min) fully prevented its ability to phosphorylate FGFR-1 (Fig. 5A). We further explored the possibility that PGE2 might displace FGF-2 from its storage sites by disrupting its binding to heparin on cell membranes (31Presta M. Dell'Era P. Mitola S. Moroni E. Ronca R. Rusnati M. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2005; 16: 159-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar). The observation that FGF-2 binding to heparin-coated beads is unperturbed by the presence of PGE2 negates this hypothesis (Fig. 5B) and indicates that PGE2 does not directly affect the FGF-2 binding to its intermediate storage site. To reveal the mechanistic effect of PGE2 on FGF-2 shedding, we examined whether the prostaglandin induced FGF-2 mobilization by MMP activation. The relevance of MMP activity in the process of FGFR-1 phosphorylation was investigated by using a potent MMP inhibitor (GM6001 25 μm, 30 min) before PGE2 challenge (15 min). Because GM6001 suppressed FGFR-1 phosphorylation (Fig. 5C), we deduce that PGE2 induces MMP activation to promote the mobilization of FGF-2 from membrane stores. Thus, mobilized-FGF-2 promotes FGFR-1 phosphorylation through an autocrine/paracrine system. We also identified the MMP involved in FGF-2 mobilization. Zymography analysis indicated that PGE2 promotes MMP-2 production/activation (Fig. 5D). Consistent with this result, MMP-2 inhibition (25 μm, 30 min of pretreatment) significantly reduced FGFR-1 phosphorylation (Fig. 5E), suggesting that this metalloproteinase is the major player in FGF-2 shedding. EP3 Receptor Subtype Promotes FGFR-1 Phosphorylation—We also studied the receptor subtype involved in PGE2-induced FGFR-1 phosphorylation. We examined whether agonists for the individual subtype were able to phosphorylate FGFR-1. Stimulation with 100 nm EP1/3, EP3/1, and EP3/4 agonists produced consistent phosphorylation of FGFR-1 (Fig. 6A), whereas EP2 agonist was devoid of effect. The extent of phosphorylation was clearly more marked for agonists activating EP3 receptor. Given the limited discriminative ability of EP agonists, we targeted downstream secondary messengers which are specific for each subtype receptors. Accordingly, we used pertussis toxin (300 ng/ml) to block Gαi protein downstream EP3, cAMP analogue (10 μm) to mimic the EP2 and EP4 activation, and A23187, a calcium ionophore (50 ng/ml), to mimic the EP1/3 activation. Although the cAMP analogue or calcium ionophore was unable to produce FGFR1 phosphorylation, pertussis toxin suppressed PGE2 phosphorylating ability, indicating that EP3 receptor is the predominant subtype involved in PGE2-induced phosphorylation of FGFR-1. Transfection of all EP receptor subtypes in CHO-FGFR-1 resulted in EPs overexpression but did not allow monitoring of FGFR-1 transactivation in response to PGE2 for the absence of FGF-2 expression in this cell model (see supplemental Figs. S1 and S2). Thus, to address more specifically the role of EP3 in FGFR-1 activation in response to PGE2, human umbilical venular endothelial cells were selected, since this cell model has the capability of expressing c-Src and FGF-2 but does not express the EP3 receptor (32Dormond O. Bezzi M. Mariotti A. Ruegg C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45838-45846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Stimulation of human umbilical venular endothelial cells with 100 nm PGE2 did not affect FGFR-1 phosphorylation (Fig. 6C), demonstrating that the EP3 receptor is responsible for FGFR-1 phosphorylation in endothelium. Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 by PGE2—We next examined the effect of PGE2 on ERK1/2 activity, a kinase representing the terminal molecule of the membrane to nucleus signaling elicited by growth factors such as FGF-2; hence, being closely associated with functional events in endothelial cells. PGE2 promoted ERK1/2 phosphorylation as early as 5 min after its application to endothelial cells (both from bovine and human origin), reaching maximal stimulation (2-fold increase over basal) after 15 min of incubation. PGE2-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was sensitive to inhibitors of signals described above such as SU5402 (FGFR-1) or PP1 (c-Src) (Fig. 7, A and B), establishing that both c-Src and FGFR-1 lie upstream to ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Conversely, the VEGFR-2 inhibitor, SU5614, exhibited no effect on ERK1/2 activation (Fig. 7C). Note also the detection of intense ERK1/2 phosphorylation in HMVEC-C (Fig. 7D) in response to PGE2 and its dependence on FGFR-1, as shown by its reduced phosphorylation after receptor blockade, indicating the existence of a FGFR-1 mechanism in endothelial cells belonging to a diverse lineage and of human origin. Furthermore, incubation of EC with inhibitors of the signaling cascade delineated above, such as GM6001 (MMPs), PP1 (c-Src), or U0126 (ERK1/2), severely reduced their ability to migrate in response to PGE2 (not shown), indicating the functional relevance of the c-Src/MMP/FGFR-1 signaling pathway for the expression of prostanoid activity. This study describes the signaling pathway involved in the action of PGE2 as a pro-angiogenic molecule in the vascular endothelium. We demonstrated that PGE2, through the rapid activation and phosphorylation of the tyrosine kinase receptor for the fibroblast growth factor-2, FGFR-1, induces endothelial cell migration and ERK1/2 activation in vitro and pseudocapillary sprouting from aortic rings in ex vivo studies. The work has been performed in cultured endothelial cells, except for few experiments conducted in vascular organ explants, because our aim was to investigate PGE2 action avoiding the interference of other cell types, such as tumor, stromal, or inflammatory cells. The most significant finding of this study concerns the key role of FGFR-1 as mediator of PGE2 stimulatory effects in endothelial cells and as a promoter of neovascularization. PGE2 exerted a concentration-related chemoattractant activity toward endothelial cells, which was stringently dependent on FGFR-1 phosphorylation. PGE2 also promoted FGFR-1 internalization, as revealed by immunohistochemistry and confocal analysis, leading to its enrichment in the perinuclear area, a feature typical of receptor activation through its natural ligand, FGF-2. Further evidence for FGFR-1 activation as a prerequisite for the functional expression of PGE2 was found in the enhanced pseudocapillary sprouting which was promptly abolished by FGFR-1 blockade with SU5402. The mechanism by which PGE2 promotes FGFR-1 phosphorylation revealed an unforeseen complexity. Because PGE2 failed to interact directly with the growth factor receptor, we thought of an indirect route leading to receptor activation. Analogous mechanisms have been recently described for other systems (e.g. the β-adrenergic and endothelin receptors), which like PGE2, act through G protein-coupled receptors (33Daub H. Weiss F.U. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1996; 379: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar, 34Maudsley S. Pierce K.L. Zamah A.M. Miller W.E. Ahn S. Daaka Y. Lefkowitz R.J. Luttrell L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9572-9580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). We focused our attention on c-Src and MMPs as possible intermediate signals between PGE2 and FGFR-1, the rationale being that a similar pattern of intracellular-extracellular events has been demonstrated to be operant for growth factor tyrosine kinase receptor activation by G protein-coupled receptors (6Pai R. Soreghan B. Szabo I.L. Pavelka M. Baatar D. Tarnawski A.S. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 289-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). Indeed, we found c-Src to be strongly stimulated by PGE2 in endothelial cells, its activation linked to FGFR-1 phosphorylation as its specific blockade (PP1), abrogated receptor activation. FGFR-1 phosphorylation in response to PGE2 was also inhibited by applying potent MMP blockers, a finding that implicates MMP activation in the FGFR-1 phosphorylation. Additional characterization indicated that MMP-2 is the MMP involved in the effect. These membrane-bound proteases, upon activation by c-Src, possibly through the intermediate phosphorylation of MT-MMP1 (35Nyalendo C. Michaud M. Beaulieu E. Roghi C. Murphy G. Gingras D. Beliveau R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 15690-15699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), induce shedding of growth factors or chemokines from their membrane-embedded storage sites, as exemplified by EGFR ligands that are released from their glycoprotein storage. The experiments with the neutralizing FGF-2 antibody, which abolished the PGE2-induced phosphorylation of FGFR-1, illustrate the existence of this extracellular mechanism, clearly indicating that activated MMP-2 mobilized FGF-2 from its membrane storage sites and, in turn, the growth factor promotes FGFR-1 phosphorylation. In addition, the observed failure of PGE2 to displace FGF-2 from heparin-coated beads highlights the specific nature of the intracellular mechanism that operates through a controlled cascade of signals. ERK1/2, the signal nearest nuclear transcription factors activation, was vigorously phosphorylated by PGE2. This signal lies downstream from the pathway here examined, as its phosphorylation was sensitive to the selective inhibitors SU5402, PP1, and GM6001. The results on PGE2-mediated actions extend to cells of different lineage and origin, possibly to the vascular endothelium in general, as indicated by the results obtained by HMVEC-C, a cell of human arterial origin. Both EP3 and EP4 receptors have been implicated in angiogenesis (18Rao R. Redha R. Macias-Perez I. Su Y. Hwang M.T. Hao C. Zent R. Breyer M.D. Pozzi A. J. Biol.

Narumiya S. Unno N. Majima M. Am. J. Pathol. 2006; 169: 1458-1472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Our evidence suggests that EP3 is the PGE2 receptor subtype that promotes c-Src and MMP2 activation, leading to FGFR-1 phosphorylation and its subsequent internalization. This cascade of events triggers the angiogenic drive in endothelial cells. The lack of VEGF involvement in the pro-angiogenic action of PGE2 in cultured endothelial cells represents an interesting finding. Clearly, the angiogenic pathway of PGE2, which for the concentrations used in this study pertains to the inflammatory process, and that of VEGF have distinct signaling patterns. In particular, PGE2 selectively promotes angiogenesis through an endogenous signal transduction pathway, FGF-2/FGFR-1, which operates in an autocrine/paracrine manner to control vascular proliferation. On the contrary, the VEGF/VEGFR-2 system operates in a paracrine manner as its activation is independent of VEGF release from stromal components. However, both pathways share c-Src as a common requirement, which for VEGF is limited to its vascular permeability effects (36Eliceiri B.P. Puente X.S. Hood J.D. Stupack D.G. Schlaepfer D.D. Huang X.Z. Sheppard D. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Conceivably, c-Src might be an appropriate target for pharmacological interventions aimed at reducing pathological angiogenesis caused by either inflammation or excess output of VEGF as it occurs in several tumors. In this context the current strategy of targeting single mediators (e.g. VEGF with antibodies) has recorded the emergence of resistance or escape from these interventions, reinforcing the concept that multiple independent pathways contribute to pathological angiogenesis, particularly in malignancy often characterized by the coexistence of inflammation and tumor progression. In conclusion, PGE2 exerts its pro-angiogenic action by recruiting the paracrineautocrine mechanism characteristic of endothelial cells, i.e. stimulation of FGFR-1 through endogenous FGF-2, which supports vascular remodeling.

In this study we have used our understanding of the appearance of visible CD spectra binding to PrP fragments to characterize Cu2+ binding to full-length PrP. We aim to investigate whether Cu2+ binds to full-length PrP in a similar fashion to the fragments, by differentiating these various Cu2+ binding modes and identifying whether the Cu2+ coordination is sequential, or simultaneous, to these various binding sites. In addition to mPrP-(23–231), we have used constructs of full-length PrP with the octarepeat region removed, or His95 and His110 replaced by alanine residues, to deconvolute the various binding modes. Ni2+ is used to further differentiate metal binding to full-length PrP, as we have previously shown that Ni2+ will bind to His96 and His111 (His95 and His110 in the mouse sequence), but not to the octarepeat region (47Garnett A.P. Jones C.E. Viles J.H. Dalton Trans. 2006; 2006: 509-518Crossref Google Scholar). There are large discrepancies reported for the Cu2+ affinity suggested for full-length PrP, ranging between micromolar (7Brown D.R. Qin K. Herms J.W. Madlung A. Manson J. Strome R. Fraser P.E.

We therefore present the use of competitive chelators to determine the affinity of Cu2+ for full-length PrPC. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Mouse Prion PrP-(23–231) Protein—The coding region of the full-length mouse PrP-(23–231) was cloned into a pET-23 vector to produce a tag-free protein as previously described (50Brown D.R. Wong B.S. Hafiz F. Clive C. Haswell S.J. Jones I.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Expression and purification is identical to previously described procedures (19Jones C.E. Abdelraheim S.R. Brown D.R. Viles J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32018-32027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) (Sequence 1). The positions of the histidines involved in Cu2+ binding are highlighted in bold. Three further constructs of recombinant mouse PrP were used, full-length mPrP-(23–231) with both His95 and His110 replaced by alanine, designated mPrP(23–231)H95A, H110A. In addition, a construct with the four octarepeat sections removed containing residues 23–56, followed by residues 90–231, designated mPrP(23–231)Δ4octa. Finally, a truncated version of PrP was obtained with only the natively unstructured domain, residues 23–125, designated mPrP-(23–125). Peptide Synthesis and Purification—Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry was used to synthesize various fragments of PrP, which were N-terminal acetylated and C-terminal amidated to mimic this region of PrP within the full-length protein (A.B.C., Imperial College, London). The peptides were removed from the resin and de-protected before purification by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography. The samples were characterized using mass spectrometry and 1H NMR spectroscopy. Peptide fragments of both mouse and human PrP are shown in Table 1.TABLE 1PrP peptide fragments Open table in a new tab Titrations—UHQ water (10–18 Ω–1 cm–1 resistivity) was used throughout. Small aliquots of fresh aqueous solutions were used to add metal ions (Cu2+ as CuCl2·2H2O, Ni2+ as NiCl2·6H2O; typically 50 mm solutions). Stock solutions of competing Cu2+ chelators, Gly, l-His, and N-(2-hydroxyethyl)iminodiacetic acid (HIMDA) (Sigma) were made up in water. Gly and l-His were added as small aliquots, whereas HIMDA was added in equivalent volume and concentrations to avoid any solubility problems of the HIMDA complex at pH 7.4. Protein and peptide concentrations were determined using an extinction coefficient at 280 nm, which is the sum of the extinction coefficients for the total number of aromatic residues and disulfide bonds; 5690 m–1 cm–1 multiplied by the number of Trp residues in the peptide, plus 1280 m–1 cm–1 multiplied by the number of Tyr residues, plus 120 m–1 cm–1 multiplied by the number of disulfide bonds (51Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5073) Google Scholar). This gave an extinction coefficient of 62,280 m–1 cm–1 at 280 nm for full-length mPrP-(23–231). Protein concentrations were also determined using a Bradford assay and were in close agreement (within 95% of each other). In the case of pentapeptides that lacked aromatic residues, the weight was used to approximate the concentration and 20% water content was assumed. Peptide concentrations were typically 100 μm for visible CD experiments and 50 μm for EPR. Titrations were carried out in the absence of buffers, except for the 0.005% sodium azide in protein samples and 10 mm sodium acetate buffer. Samples were diluted for individual titrations; sodium acetate concentration was typically 1 mm. The pH was measured before and after acquiring each spectrum, adjusting the pH when necessary using small aliquots of 100 mm NaOH or HCl. Circular Dichroism (CD)—CD spectra were recorded on an Applied Photophysics Chirascan instrument at 25 °C. A cell with a 1-cm path length was used for spectra recorded between 300 and 800 nm, with sampling points every 2 nm. Typically, four scans were recorded, and baseline spectra were subtracted from each spectrum. Data were processed using Applied Photophysics Chirascan Viewer, Microsoft Excel, and the Kaleida-Graph spreadsheet/graph package. The direct CD measurements (θ, in millidegrees) were converted to molar ellipticity, Δϵ (m–1 cm–1), using the relationship Δϵ = θ/33,000·c·l, where c is the concentration and l is the path length. Absorption Spectroscopy (UV-visible)—UV-visible electronic absorption spectra were obtained with a Hitachi U-3010 double beam spectrophotometer, using a 1-cm path length. Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (EPR)—X-band EPR spectra were acquired on a Bruker Elexsys E500 spectrometer operating at a microwave frequency of 9.33 GHz. The spectra were acquired over a sweep width of 2500 gauss, a modulation frequency of 10 gauss, and a temperature of ∼20 K. At least three scans were acquired per sample. Cu2+ Binding to Full-length mPrP-(23–231) and the Natively Unfolded Domain, PrP-(23–125), Monitored by Visible CD—Visible CD has been used extensively to study Cu2+ binding to fragments from PrP (summarized in Fig. 1). Here, we use the same approach to study full-length PrP. Fig. 2 shows a Cu2+ titration of full-length PrP-(23–231) at pH 7.4 monitored by visible CD. Panel a presents the titration up to 1.8 mol eq of Cu2+, increasing in 0.3 mol eq with each aliquot. Initial Cu2+ additions caused the appearance of a negative CD band at ∼576 nm, accompanied by a weak positive CD band at 500 nm. After ∼1.8 mol eq the intensity of the two bands plateaus. By 2 mol eq of Cu2+, the band at 576 nm turns more positive as more Cu2+ is added, as shown by the binding curve inset. The Cu2+ titration is shown in two separate panels for clarity; panel b shows the titration from 1.8 mol eq of Cu2+ up to 9 mol eq in 0.9 mol eq steps. In Fig. 2b we observe the negative CD at 576 nm adopting a more positive signal, and a negative band also emerging at 692 nm only after more than 1.8 mol eq of Cu2+ are added. The Cu2+ titration reveals a number of distinct sequential binding modes. It is notable that even at 0.3 mol eq of Cu2+ the CD band at 576 nm is apparent, the signal increases linearly in intensity between 0 and 0.9 mol eq of Cu2+ added. Fig. 2c is the visible CD difference spectra that results when the spectrum for 1.8 mol eq of Cu2+ is subtracted from all subsequent spectra of full-length mPrP-(23–231). The new difference spectrum that emerges is very comparable with that observed for the visible CD for Cu2+ binding to peptides of the octarepeat region (9Viles J.H. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B.

Chem. 2003; 278: 6795-6802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). This is evident by comparing the visible CD spectra for Cu2+ binding to mPrP-(57–90), a peptide of PrP incorporating the four octarepeats, shown in Fig. 2d. In both sets of spectra two positive CD bands are observed around 340 and 590 nm, accompanied by a negative band at 680 nm. The wavelength position, sign, and relative intensity of CD bands are strikingly similar. There is a notable difference in intensity of the CD bands for Cu2+ binding to full-length PrP and the smaller mouse octarepeats fragment. To summarize, the data in Fig. 2 suggest there are at least two modes of Cu2+ binding; the first ∼2 mol eq of Cu2+ produce a negative CD band at 580 nm and a weak positive CD band at 500 nm. This is followed by Cu2+ binding that produces CD signals indicative of binding to single histidines within the octarepeats of PrP. We were interested in whether the structured domain, residues 125–231, influences Cu2+ binding to full-length PrP. A similar Cu2+ titration was performed on the recombinant fragment mPrP-(23–125), which consists of just the unstructured, flexible N terminus of PrP, shown in Fig. 3. The visible CD spectra have a very similar appearance to the full-length protein, as we observe an initial negative signal at ∼580 nm up to 1.8 mol eq of Cu2+ with Δϵ ≈–0.35 m–1 cm–1, before producing positive CD bands at 340 and 590 nm and a negative band at 680 nm as the titration continues. As with full-length PrP, the appearance of the octarepeats signal after 2 mol eq is more apparent in the difference spectrum, shown in Fig. 3c. The binding curve at 576 nm shows the first 2 eq of Cu2+ binding, followed by 4 Cu2+ ions binding to the octarepeats. Saturation of the binding sites is suggested above 6 eq of Cu2+. There is a close similarity between the visible CD spectra for PrP-(23–231) and PrP-(23–125) (although not identical), which suggests the Cu2+ binding modes are very similar and Cu2+ binding to PrP is largely unaffected by the structured domain of PrP. The weak positive band at 500 nm seen for PrP-(23–231) is not apparent in the PrP-(23–125) spectra. The band could be masked by another negative signal at 500 nm, which is suggested in spectra shown in Fig. 4(a).FIGURE 4Cu2+ titration of mPrP-(23–231) H95A,H110A.

Autophagy is responsible for bulk protein degradation in the vacuole/lysosome and plays a crucial role in fundamental biological processes (1Seglen P.O. Bohley P.

In the autophagic process, double membrane vesicles called autophagosomes sequester cargos destined for degradation. Then the outer membrane of the autophagosomes fuses with the lysosomal/vacuolar membrane to deliver the cargo into the lumen together with the inner membrane. In yeast, detailed analysis of autophagy-defective mutants has helped clarify the molecular mechanisms of autophagy (4Klionsky D.J. Cregg J.M. Dunn Jr., W.A. Emr S.D. Sakai Y. Sandoval I.V. Sibirny A. Subramani S. Thumm M. Veenhuis M. Ohsumi Y. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 539-545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar). Most autophagy-defective mutants display an abnormality in autophagosome formation and cannot survive under starvation conditions. Characterization of the mutants has revealed two protein conjugation pathways required for autophagosome formation, namely the Atg8 and Atg12 conjugation systems (5Mizushima N. Noda T. Yoshimori T.

Atg12, a ubiquitin-like protein, is covalently linked to Atg5 via an isopeptide bond between the C-terminal glycine of Atg12 and Lys-149 of Atg5 by sequential reactions catalyzed by Atg7 (an E1 2The abbreviations used are: E1ubiquitin-activating enzymeE2ubiquitin carrier proteinE3ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligaseDOPEdioleoylphosphatidylethanolaminePOPC1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphoshatidylcholineDOPAdioleoylphosphatidic acidPEphosphatidylethanolamineHAhemagglutininCBBCoomassie Brilliant BlueMALDImatrix-assisted laser desorption ionizationTOFtime-of-flightMSmass spectrometry. 2The abbreviations used are: E1ubiquitin-activating enzymeE2ubiquitin carrier proteinE3ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligaseDOPEdioleoylphosphatidylethanolaminePOPC1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphoshatidylcholineDOPAdioleoylphosphatidic acidPEphosphatidylethanolamineHAhemagglutininCBBCoomassie Brilliant BlueMALDImatrix-assisted laser desorption ionizationTOFtime-of-flightMSmass spectrometry.-like enzyme) and Atg10 (an E2-like enzyme). Atg12-Atg5 conjugates further associate with Atg16 to form Atg12-Atg5·Atg16 complexes (7Kuma A. Mizushima N. Ishihara N. Ohsumi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18619-18625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Another ubiquitin-like protein, Atg8, is first processed by the cysteine protease Atg4 (8Kirisako T.

Atg4 removes a C-terminal arginine residue of Atg8 to expose a glycine residue. Processed Atg8 is covalently linked to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) via an amide bond between the C-terminal glycine of Atg8 and the terminal amino group of PE by sequential reactions catalyzed by Atg7 and Atg3 (an E2-like enzyme) (6Ichimura Y.

To date, more than 30 different ATG (autophagy-related) genes specifically affecting various steps of autophagy have been identified (9Bassham D.C. Laporte M. Marty F. Moriyasu Y. Ohsumi Y. Olsen L.J. Yoshimoto K. Autophagy. 2006; 2: 2-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Although most of these genes were initially identified in yeast, many of them are functionally conserved in higher eukaryotes, including mammals and plants. In plants, autophagy has been suggested to play a critical role in physiological and developmental responses, such as nutrient recycling during starvation, senescence, and apoptotic processes as well as the pathogen-induced hypersensitive response (10Thompson A.R. Vierstra R.D. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2005; 8: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Genome analysis of Arabidopsis identified at least 24 AtATG genes that are homologous to 31 yeast ATG genes (9Bassham D.C. Laporte M. Marty F. Moriyasu Y. Ohsumi Y. Olsen L.J. Yoshimoto K. Autophagy. 2006; 2: 2-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Several genes are present as multigene families and are predicted to express splicing variants. The functional domains and essential amino acids of yeast Atg proteins are well conserved in Arabidopsis homologs, suggesting that the molecular mechanisms of autophagosome formation are conserved between yeast and plants. Arabidopsis possesses all of the genes involved in the two conjugation systems essential for autophagosome formation and was shown to utilize the AtATG8 and AtATG12 conjugation systems for autophagy (11Doelling J.H.

Hayashi H. Shibata D. Tabata S. Ohsumi Y. Plant Physiol. 2002; 129: 1181-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). In Arabidopsis, there exist two forms of AtATG8, form I and form II. Form II migrates faster than form I in SDS-PAGE; therefore, it was thought to be the PE-conjugated form as in the case of yeast Atg8 (13Yoshimoto K. Hanaoka H. Sato S. Kato T. Tabata S. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 2967-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Arabidopsis lacking AtATG4s (Atatg4a4b), AtATG5, or AtATG7 displayed increased chlorosis, accelerated bolting, enhanced dark-induced senescence of detached leaves, and reduced seed yield under nutrient-limiting conditions (10Thompson A.R. Vierstra R.D. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2005; 8: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The AtATG7C558S mutant is hypersensitive to nutrient-limiting conditions and showed premature leaf senescence (11Doelling J.H. Walker J.M. Friedman E.M. Thompson A.R. Vierstra R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33105-33114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). In a double mutant of the AtATG4s, no autophagosomes were observed, and AtATG8s were not delivered to the vacuole under nitrogen-starved conditions (13Yoshimoto K. Hanaoka H. Sato S. Kato T. Tabata S. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 2967-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Further, sucrose starvation induces autophagy and transiently up-regulates the AtATG genes encoding the AtATG8 conjugation system in a sequential manner (14Rose T.L. Bonneau L. Der C. Marty-Mazars D. Marty F. Biol. Cell. 2006; 98: 53-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). However, the precise roles of the components of the conjugation systems in the formation of autophagosomes remain unknown. In vivo studies using mammalian and yeast cells have so far supported the presence of cross-talk between the Atg8 and Atg12 conjugation systems (15Tanida I. Ueno T. Kominami E. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 2503-2518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). In mammals, LC3 (microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3), a mammalian ortholog of yeast Atg8, is converted to LC3-II, a PE-conjugated form. The formation of LC3-II was impaired in ATG5-deficient mouse embryonic stem cells (16Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Hatano M. Kobayashi Y. Kabeya Y. Suzuki K. Tokuhisa T. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 657-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar). The formation of yeast Atg8-PE was also abolished in yeast cells deficient in any components of the Atg12 system (17Suzuki K. Kirisako T. Kamada Y. Mizushima N. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5971-5981Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). However, an excess amount of Atg12-Atg5 conjugates was reported to inhibit the formation of LC3-II, whereas Atg12 alone facilitated the formation of LC3-II in HEK293 cells (18Tanida I. Nishitani T. Nemoto T. Ueno T. Kominami E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 296: 1164-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Despite substantial efforts, the molecular details and biological significance of the cross-talk between the two conjugation systems remain elusive. In order to clarify the cross-talk mechanism between the AtATG8 and AtATG12 conjugation systems, we reconstituted the AtATG8 and AtATG12 conjugation systems in vitro. Furthermore, using the in vitro systems, we showed that AtATG12-AtATG5 conjugates accelerated the formation of AtATG8-PE, and AtATG3 inhibited the AtATG12 conjugation system. The reconstitution systems we present herein allow us not only to study the relationship between the two conjugation systems but also to identify and characterize any other factors that can regulate these conjugation systems. Plasmid Construction—To construct Escherichia coli expression plasmids encoding AtATG3-FLAG, AtATG5-HA (hemagglutinin), AtATG10-myc, AtATG12b, and the C-terminal glycine-exposed form of AtATG8a–8i (AtATG8-form I), the appropriate genes were amplified by PCR and cloned into pGEX-6P-1 (GE Healthcare). The reverse primers containing FLAG, HA, and Myc epitope coding sequences were used to amplify the AtATG3, AtATG5, and AtATG10 genes, respectively. The AtATG7 gene was amplified by PCR and cloned into pGEX-His, a modified version of pGEX-6P-1 (19Hashida S. Yuzawa S. Suzuki N.N. Fujioka Y. Takikawa T. Sumimoto H. Inagaki F. Fujii H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26378-26386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To construct E. coli co-expression plasmids encoding AtATG3 and AtATG7, the AtATG3 and AtATG7 genes were amplified by PCR and cloned into pRSFDuet-1 (Novagen) and pACYC184 with the T7 promoter, respectively. The reverse primers containing FLAG and His6 coding sequences were used to amplify the AtATG3 and AtATG7 gene, respectively. The genes of the full-length AtATG8a and AtATG8a-form I were amplified by PCR and cloned into pET-11a. Mutations leading to the specific amino acid substitutions were introduced by PCR-mediated site-directed mutagenesis. All of the constructs were sequenced to confirm their identities and transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3). Protein Expression and Purification—Expression of recombinant AtATG proteins was induced by the addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After induction, cells were disrupted by sonication in PBS(–) containing 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. All of the glutathione S-transferase-fused proteins were first purified using a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (GE Healthcare), followed by excision of glutathione S-transferase from the proteins with PreScission protease (GE Healthcare). All of the proteins except for AtATG7 were again applied to a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column in order to remove the excised glutathione S-transferase. AtATG7 was applied to an Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, and 10 mm imidazole and eluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 200 mm imidazole. Further purification was performed using the following procedures. AtATG3 was applied to a Resource Q column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 8.0, and the protein was eluted with a 0–400 mm NaCl gradient in the same buffer. AtATG5, AtATG7, and AtATG10 were purified on a Superdex 200 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) and eluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. AtATG8a–8i-form I were purified on a Superdex 75 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) and eluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 8.0 and 150 mm NaCl. Purification of AtATG12b was performed as described previously (20Suzuki N.N. Yoshimoto K. Fujioka Y. Ohsumi Y. Inagaki F. Autophagy. 2005; 1: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). AtATG12-AtATG5 conjugates formed by in vitro reconstitution were applied to a HiTrap DEAE FF column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 8.0, and eluted with a 0–400 mm NaCl gradient in the same buffer. Liposome Preparation—To prepare liposomes with various phospholipid compositions, phospholipids were mixed in a glass tube at the appropriate ratios in chloroform. Dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphoshatidylcholine (POPC), dioleoyl phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol from bovine liver, and dioleoylphosphatidic acid (DOPA) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids. The chloroform solvent was removed using a rotary evaporator. Samples were further dried in a desiccator under vacuum for 12 h. The resulting lipid film was suspended in a buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl) at a final concentration of 1 mm phospholipid by mixing vigorously. Samples were then subjected to sonication for 5 min to obtain small unilamellar liposomes. Antibodies and Immunoblotting—Polyclonal antibodies against AtATG8a and AtATG12b have been previously described (13Yoshimoto K. Hanaoka H. Sato S. Kato T. Tabata S. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 2967-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 20Suzuki N.N. Yoshimoto K. Fujioka Y. Ohsumi Y. Inagaki F. Autophagy. 2005; 1: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated monoclonal antibodies against HA and FLAG M2 were purchased from Sigma. Monoclonal antibodies against Myc (9E10) and Penta-His were purchased from Covance, Research Products, Inc., and Qiagen, respectively. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) and GE Healthcare, respectively. SDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemmli's method. SDS-PAGE separation in the presence of 6 m urea (urea-SDS-polyacrylamide gel) was used to distinguish between AtATG8-form I and AtATG8-form II. SDS-polyacrylamide gels were stained using Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB). For immunoblot analyses, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P; Millipore). Immunoblotting analysis was performed using appropriate antibodies, and signals were detected using Immobilon Western (Millipore) and were recorded using an ECL Mini-Camera (GE Healthcare). Reconstitution of the AtATG8 Conjugation System in Vitro—In vitro reconstitution of the AtATG8 system was performed using purified AtATG proteins and liposomes. Liposomes were mixed with purified 10 μm AtATG7-His, 10 μm AtATG3-FLAG, and 50 μm AtATG8-form I in reconstitution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm ATP), and the reaction mixture was incubated for 1 h at 30°C. The conjugation reaction was stopped by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples were subjected to urea-SDS-PAGE and stained by CBB. Reconstitution of the AtATG12 Conjugation System in Vitro—Purified 10 μm AtATG7-His, 10 μm AtATG10-myc, 10 μm AtATG5-HA, and 10 μm AtATG12b were mixed in reconstitution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm ATP), and the reaction mixture was incubated for 1 h at 30°C. The conjugation reaction was stopped by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples were subjected to urea-SDS-PAGE and stained by CBB. Mass Spectrometry—The formation of AtATG8a-form II was performed as described above. Then the reaction solutions were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) using a Voyager-DE STR mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems) in linear mode. The instrument was externally calibrated with equine cytochrome c and apomyoglobin (Sigma). For MALDI-TOF-MS measurements in linear mode using an external calibration, m/z differences from the calculated value were generally up to 2 mass units, around m/z 15,000. The reaction mixture samples (5 μl) were centrifuged at 13,200 × g for 10 min. The resultant precipitates were dissolved in 5 μl of 30% acetonitrile (aqueous) containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. One μl of the sample solutions was used for MALDI-TOF-MS analysis after co-crystallization on a stainless steel target with a 1:4 saturated solution of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid in 70% acetonitrile (aqueous) containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid as matrix. A nitrogen laser (337 nm) was employed for desorption/ionization, and the ion acceleration voltage was 25 kV. The data were collected in the m/z 10,000–20,000 range, and each mass spectrum was averaged from 150 laser shots. The data for the spectra shown in Fig. 2C were processed with a 15-point Gaussian smoothing filter and autobase-line correction using Voyager Data Explorer software (Applied Biosystem). Assay for Delipidation of AtATG8-form II—The formation of AtATG8-form II was performed as described above. Then 1 μm AtATG4a, 1 μm AtATG4b, or 1000 units of phospholipase D from Streptomyces chromofuscus (Sigma) was added, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for the indicated time. The precipitants obtained by centrifuging the reaction solutions at 20,630 × g for 10 min were mixed with SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. Samples were subjected to urea-SDS-PAGE and stained by CBB. Reconstitution of the AtATG12 Conjugation System in Vitro—In our previous report, we showed that in the plant extracts, AtATG12 was detected as two bands corresponding to the proper molecular weight and a higher molecular weight not detected in homozygous Atatg5-1 or Atatg10-1 mutant plants (20Suzuki N.N. Yoshimoto K. Fujioka Y. Ohsumi Y. Inagaki F. Autophagy. 2005; 1: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This suggests that the slower migrating band corresponds to AtATG12-AtATG5 conjugates, and, therefore, Arabidopsis possesses the AtATG12 conjugation system. Thus, we examined whether AtATG5, AtATG7, AtATG10, and AtATG12 represent the minimum components of the AtATG12 conjugation system. Purified recombinant proteins for AtATG7, AtATG10, AtATG5, and AtATG12b were mixed with ATP and incubated for 1 h at 30°C. As shown in Fig. 1A, lane 6, a new 50 kDa band was detected only when all of the components were present in the reaction mixture. The theoretical molecular mass of the AtATG12-AtATG5 conjugate is ∼50 kDa. Additionally, the 50 kDa band was detected by both anti-AtATG12b and anti-HA antibodies (Fig. 1A, middle and bottom). Therefore, we concluded that the 50 kDa band corresponded to the AtATG12-AtATG5 conjugates, indicating that AtATG5, AtATG7, AtATG10, AtATG12, and ATP are sufficient for the formation of an AtATG12-AtATG5 conjugate. Next, to confirm the catalytic residues of AtATG7 and AtATG10 required for AtATG12 conjugation and the conjugation site of AtATG5, we prepared recombinant mutant proteins that were subsequently applied to an in vitro reconstitution reaction. AtATG12-AtATG5 conjugates were formed in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1B); however, as shown in Fig. 1C, the AtATG12-AtATG5 conjugates were not formed when AtATG7C558S, AtATG10C178S, or AtATG5K128R was used instead of wild-type proteins. These results suggest that AtATG7 and AtATG10 function as enzymes, presumably E1 and E2, respectively, and conjugate AtATG12 to the side chain of Lys-128 of AtATG5. Reconstitution of the AtATG8 Conjugation System in Vitro—In vitro reconstitution of the Atg8 conjugation system was established using purified yeast and mammalian recombinant proteins (21Ichimura Y. Imamura Y. Emoto K. Umeda M. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40584-40592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 22Sou Y.S. Tanida I. Komatsu M. Ueno T. Kominami E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3017-3024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Since yeast Atg8-PE was formed efficiently in the presence of Atg3, Atg7, ATP, and 70% DOPE, 30% POPC liposomes (21Ichimura Y. Imamura Y. Emoto K. Umeda M. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40584-40592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), we attempted to reconstitute the AtATG8a conjugation system in vitro under the same conditions. Recombinant proteins of AtATG3, AtATG7, and AtATG8a-form I were mixed with 70% DOPE, 30% POPC liposomes in the presence of ATP and incubated for 1 h at 30°C. We failed to detect any change in AtATG8a under these conditions. Since the addition of negatively charged phospholipids to liposomes was known to enhance the level of yeast Atg8-PE formation in vitro (21Ichimura Y. Imamura Y. Emoto K. Umeda M. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40584-40592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), we next attempted to reconstitute the AtATG8 system using liposomes containing negatively charged phospholipids. AtATG3, AtATG7, AtATG8a-form I, and ATP were mixed with liposomes, the lipid components of which are shown in Fig. 2A, and incubated for 1 h at 30°C. In the reconstitution system using yeast proteins, liposomes containing yeast Atg8-PE were precipitable by centrifugation (21Ichimura Y. Imamura Y. Emoto K. Umeda M. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40584-40592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar); therefore, the reaction solution was centrifuged at 20,630 × g for 10 min, and then the supernatants and precipitates were subjected to urea-SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 2A, a faster migrating band, similar to the AtATG8a-form II detected in vivo, was observed in the precipitate only when using liposomes containing both PE and acidic lipids. Thus, we concluded that the AtATG8a conjugation system was reconstituted in vitro. Since AtATG8a-form II was recovered mostly in the precipitates, in the following experiments we analyzed the precipitates obtained from the reaction solutions by centrifugation to measure the amount of AtATG8-form II. Next, we examined the minimum components required for the AtATG8 conjugation system. As shown in Fig. 2B, top, lane 5, AtATG8a-form II was detected only when AtATG3, AtATG7, AtATG8a-form I, liposomes, and ATP were present in the reaction solution. Furthermore, we confirmed that the band of AtATG8a-form II reacted with the antibody against AtATG8a (Fig. 2B, bottom). We also detected a 50 kDa band, which requires the presence of AtATG7, AtATG3, AtATG8a-form I, and ATP but not liposomes (Fig. 2B, top, lanes 3 and 5). The apparent molecular mass of the protein was consistent with the molecular mass estimated for the AtATG3-AtATG8a intermediate. Furthermore, the band reacted with both anti-FLAG and anti-AtATG8a antibodies (Fig. 2B). Taken together, these results suggest that the 50-kDa band is the AtATG3-AtATG8a intermediate and that AtATG3, AtATG7, AtATG8a-form I, ATP, and liposomes are necessary and sufficient for the formation of AtATG8a-form II. To examine whether AtATG8a-form II is a PE-modified form of AtATG8a, MALDI-TOF-MS analysis was performed on the reaction mixtures. MALDI-TOF-MS analysis gave two signals at m/z 13,516 and 14,242 (Fig. 2C). The former value was assigned to AtATG8a-form I (13,514.6). Since the mass peak at 14,242 was observed only when ATP was present, it was assigned to AtATG8a-form II. The difference in molecular mass between AtATG8a-PE and AtATG8a-form I should be 726 Da. This is in good agreement with the observed difference in molecular mass between AtATG8a-form I and AtATG8a-form II (726 Da). The result clearly shows that AtATG8a is, in fact, modified by PE in vitro. Next, in order to identify the catalytic residues of AtATG3 and AtATG7 required for the AtATG8 conjugation reaction, recombinant mutant proteins were prepared and used for in vitro reconstitution reaction. At ATG8a-PE was formed in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2D) but was not formed when AtATG7C558S or AtATG3C258S was used instead of the respective wild-type proteins (Fig. 2E). These results suggest that AtATG7 and AtATG3 function as enzymes, presumably E1 and E2, respectively, and conjugate the C-terminal glycine of AtATG8a-form I to PE. Arabidopsis has nine AtATG8 homologs, all of which display significant homology to yeast Atg8 and have a glycine residue corresponding to the Gly-116 of yeast Atg8, the conjugation site for PE (11Doelling J.H. Walker J.M. Friedman E.M. Thompson A.R. Vierstra R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33105-33114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 12Hanaoka H. Noda T. Shirano Y. Kato T. Hayashi H. Shibata D. Tabata S. Ohsumi Y. Plant Physiol. 2002; 129: 1181-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). We next examined whether all of the AtATG8 homologs can be modified using the in vitro reconstitution system. We confirmed that all of the AtATG8 homologs were converted to AtATG8-form II (AtATG8-PE) when AtATG8s were incubated with AtATG7, AtATG3, liposomes, and ATP, although the formation of AtATG8-form II was low for AtATG8c, AtATG8g, and AtATG8i (Fig. 3). Deconjugation of AtATG8-form II by AtATG4s—AtATG8s tagged with three consecutive Myc epitopes at the C terminus were cleaved by AtATG4s in vivo (13Yoshimoto K. Hanaoka H. Sato S. Kato T. Tabata S. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 2967-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). AtATG4s have significant sequence homology with yeast Atg4, which deconjugates yeast Atg8-PE conjugates both in vivo and in vitro (8Kirisako T. Ichimura Y. Okada H. Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Yoshimori T. Ohsumi M. Takao T. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 263-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). Therefore, we first examined whether AtATG8a-PE could be cleaved by AtATG4s. AtATG8a-PE was formed using the in vitro reconstitution system and subsequently incubated with AtATG4s. The reaction solutions were centrifuged, and then the precipitates were subjected to urea-SDS-PAGE. The amount of AtATG8a-PE obtained when treated with AtATG4s was significantly reduced, which is in contrast to the absence of any change in AtATG8a-PE when treated with water and is similar to the degree of reduction observed in AtATG8a-PE when treated with phospholipase D, which releases phosphatidic acid from the conjugate (Fig. 4A). The result shows that AtATG8a-PE is deconjugated by both AtATG4a and AtATG4b. We examined other AtATG8s in the same manner and again detected decreases in AtATG8-form II, except AtATG8g and AtATG8i, by incubation with AtATG4s (Fig. 4B). AtATG8g and AtATG8i readily aggregated prior to conjugation; therefore, it is possible that their respective form II compounds are too strongly aggregated to be deconjugated by AtATG4s. The Effect of AtATG12-AtATG5 Conjugates on the AtATG8 Conjugation System—As previously reported, the absence of yeast Atg12-Atg5 conjugates results in a severe decrease in yeast Atg8-PE in vivo (17Suzuki K. Kirisako T. Kamada Y. Mizushima N. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5971-5981Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). In addition, yeast Atg12-Atg5 conjugates were recently shown to enhance the formation of yeast Atg8-PE in vitro. 3Handa, T., Noda, N. N., Satomi, Y., Ichimura, Y., Fujioka, Y., Takao, T., Inagaki, F., and Ohsumi, Y. (2007) J. Biol. Chem. 282, 37298–37302. To confirm the effect of AtATG12-AtATG5 conjugates on the formation of AtATG8-PE, we attempted to introduce AtATG12-AtATG5 conjugates into the AtATG8 conjugation system. AtATG12-AtATG5 conjugates were prepared using the in vitro reconstitution system and subsequently purified by anion exchange chromatography. Formation of AtATG8a-PE was significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of AtATG12-AtATG5 conjugates (Fig. 5A). On the other hand, the introduction of AtATG12 or AtATG5 alone or in combination did not increase the level of AtATG8-PE (Fig. 5B), indicating that the covalent linkage between AtATG12 and AtATG5 is essential for their acceleration of AtATG8-PE formation. The Effect of AtATG3 on the AtATG12 Conjugation System—The amount of mammalian Atg12-Atg5 conjugates formed was reported to increase significantly in COS7 cells when Atg3 was overexpressed together with Atg7 and Atg12 (23Tanida I. Tanida-Miyake E. Komatsu M. Ueno T. Kominami E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13739-13744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). In order to verify the effect of AtATG3 on AtATG12-AtATG5 conjugation efficiency, we introduced AtATG3 into the AtATG12 conjugation system. The amount of AtATG12-AtATG5 conjugates formed was decreased by the addition of AtATG3 at an equal molar ratio to the components of the AtATG12 conjugation system (Fig. 6A). Next, to address whether the inhibition of the AtATG12-AtATG5 conjugation reaction by AtATG3 is competitive, 1–5-fold molar ratios of AtATG10 were introduced to the reaction mixture containing the components of the AtATG12 conjugation system and AtATG3. AtATG12-AtATG5 conjugate formation recovered in a dose-dependent manner with the addition of AtATG10 (Fig. 6B). Additionally, the formation of AtATG12-AtATG5 conjugates similarly recovered in the presence of excess amounts of AtATG7 (Fig. 6C). These results indicate that AtATG3 competitively inhibits the formation of AtATG12-AtATG5 conjugates in vitro. In the present study, we reconstituted the AtATG12 and AtATG8 conjugation systems using recombinant proteins in vitro. We demonstrated that the cysteine residues of AtATG3, AtATG7, and AtATG10 as well as the lysine residue of AtATG5, all of which were conserved among Arabidopsis, yeast, and mammals, were actually crucial for the conjugation reactions, showing that the AtATG8 and AtATG12 conjugation systems in Arabidopsis are functionally homologous to the conjugation systems in yeast and mammals. AtATG12-AtATG5 conjugates were formed by the enzymatic reactions of AtATG7 (E1-like) and AtATG10 (E2-like) in vitro, although the reaction was not as efficient as that in vivo. Some additional factor(s) might further enhance this conjugation reaction in vivo. In vitro reconstitution of the mammalian Atg12 conjugation system was reported recently (24Shao Y. Gao Z. Feldman T. Jiang X. Autophagy. 2007; 3: 10-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In that case, the Atg12-Atg5 conjugation efficiency was extremely low, and ribonucleic acids were required to enhance the conjugation reaction, although the mechanism underlying this effect was elusive. We also introduced ribonucleic acids into the AtATG12 conjugation system, but no improvement in the efficiency of AtATG12-AtATG5 formation was detected (data not shown). Although the basic mechanism of the Atg12 system is conserved between mammals and Arabidopsis, differences in the regulation of the system may exist. AtATG8-PE was also formed by the enzymatic reactions of AtATG7 and AtATG3. Arabidopsis has nine AtATG8 homologs, all of which were converted to form II, the PE-conjugated form, in vitro but with different efficiency. Furthermore, form II of seven homologs among nine was deconjugated by AtATG4a and -4b in vitro, again with different efficiency. These results suggest that nine AtATG8 homologs might have distinct functions in Arabidopsis. In fact, nine AtATG8 homologs showed distinct spatial and temporal expression patterns in roots of young Arabidopsis (25Slavikova S. Shy G. Yao Y. Glozman R. Levanony H. Pietrokovski S. Elazar Z. Galili G. J. Exp. Bot. 2005; 56: 2839-2849Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Detailed functional analyses of each AtATG8 homolog in vivo are required to reveal each function of these homologs. The efficiency of AtATG8-PE formation in the in vitro reconstitution reaction was much lower than that in plant cells. We used synthetic liposomes, which differ from plant membranes in various points, for in vitro reconstitution. In one case, plant membrane phospholipids consist of 35.5% POPC, 38.9% DOPE, 9% phosphatidylglycerol, 5.1% phosphatidylinositol, 5.1% phosphatidylserine, and 6.4% DOPA (26Uemura M. Joseph R.A. Steponkus P.L. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar); therefore, we also prepared synthetic liposomes consisting of these lipids for use in in vitro reconstitution. However, the use of these synthetic lipids again failed to raise efficiency (data not shown). Since the endomembranes of plant cells are diverse, there might be a more appropriate ratio of phospholipids for AtATG8-PE formation. In vitro reconstitution of the yeast Atg8 system has been reported (21Ichimura Y. Imamura Y. Emoto K. Umeda M. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40584-40592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Yeast Atg8-PE is formed efficiently with 70% PE, 30% phosphatidylcholine liposomes in vitro. However, the efficiency of the Atg8-PE formation is low, with 20% PE, 80% phosphatidylcholine liposomes, the PE content of which is similar to that of yeast organelle membranes, such as mitochondria and vacuoles. In vitro reconstitution of the LC3 conjugation system has also been reported, in which the efficiency of LC3-II formation was low (22Sou Y.S. Tanida I. Komatsu M. Ueno T. Kominami E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3017-3024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). These studies, together with our results, raise the possibility that Atg8 conjugation systems require additional factor(s), such as an E3 enzyme, for efficient conjugation. In yeast and mammals, the Atg12 conjugation system is known to be crucial for the efficient formation of Atg8-PE (16Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Hatano M. Kobayashi Y. Kabeya Y. Suzuki K. Tokuhisa T. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 657-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar, 17Suzuki K. Kirisako T. Kamada Y. Mizushima N. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5971-5981Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). Recently, in vitro reconstitution experiments revealed that yeast Atg12-Atg5 conjugates, but not Atg12 or Atg5, directly enhance the conjugation of yeast Atg8 to PE, suggesting that Atg12-Atg5 conjugates act as the E3 enzyme in the Atg8 system.3 Using the in vitro reconstitution systems, we showed that AtATG12-AtATG5 conjugates also significantly promote the conjugation of AtATG8 to PE (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, we also showed that AtATG12 and AtATG5 alone or in combination did not promote the conjugation reaction (Fig. 5B). Therefore, AtATG12-AtATG5 conjugates are also considered to act as the E3 enzyme in the AtATG8 system. These observations strongly suggest that the E3-like role of Atg12-Atg5 conjugates in the Atg8 system is evolutionarily conserved. It has been reported that excess amounts of mammalian Atg12-Atg5 conjugates inhibit the formation of LC3-II in HEK293 cells when mammalian Atg12, Atg5, Atg7, and LC3 are simultaneously overexpressed (18Tanida I. Nishitani T. Nemoto T. Ueno T. Kominami E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 296: 1164-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Thus, the molar ratio between Atg proteins may be important for efficient Atg8-PE formation. To clarify this, mammalian systems should also be studied using in vitro reconstitution systems in a similar manner to yeast and Arabidopsis systems. AtATG3 inhibited the formation of AtATG12-AtATG5 conjugates (Fig. 6A). The inhibition of AtATG12-AtATG5 conjugation by AtATG3 was recovered by excess amounts of AtATG10 (Fig. 6B). These results suggest that the two E2-like enzymes compete against each other in the conjugation reactions. In ubiquitin-like conjugation systems, the direct interaction between E1 and E2 is crucial for the transfer of a modifier from E1 to E2, which is an essential event prior to the conjugation reaction. The Atg8 and Atg12 conjugation systems employ the same E1-like enzyme, Atg7. In vitro pull-down assays showed that AtATG7 directly binds to AtATG3 and AtATG10 (data not shown). It is possible that the AtATG7 binding sites for AtATG3 and AtATG10 overlap with each other, resulting in competition between these E2 enzymes for binding to AtATG7. In fact, the inhibition of AtATG12-AtATG5 conjugation by AtATG3 was recovered by excess amounts of AtATG7 (Fig. 6C). It has been reported that overexpression of mammalian Atg3 facilitates the formation of Atg12-Atg5 conjugates in COS7 cells, and overexpression of mammalian Atg10 facilitates the formation of LC3-II in HEK293 cells in the presence of excess Atg7 (23Tanida I.

Since in vivo studies were performed in the presence of excess Atg7, competition between Atg3 and Atg10 for binding to Atg7 might have been abolished. Our present data did not show any sign of enhanced AtATG12-AtATG5 formation by the introduction of AtATG3. We also introduced AtATG10 into the AtATG8 conjugation system but could not detect any change in the level of AtATG8a-PE formation (data not shown). The stoichiometry among Atg proteins might be crucial for such enhancement. Alternatively, there might be some differences in the regulation of the two conjugation systems between mammals and Arabidopsis. The in vitro reconstitution systems we present here will be a powerful tool in helping to address these problems."
https://openalex.org/W1982506421,"Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signals regulate the growth and differentiation of diverse lineages. The association of mutations in the BMP type II receptor (BMPRII) with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension suggests an important role of this receptor in vascular remodeling. Pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells lacking BMPRII can transduce BMP signals using ActRIIa (Activin type II receptor). We investigated whether or not BMP signaling via the two receptors leads to differential effects on vascular smooth muscle cells. BMP4, but not BMP7, inhibited platelet-derived growth factor-activated proliferation in wild-type pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells, whereas neither ligand inhibited the growth of BMPRII-deficient cells. Adenoviral gene transfer of BMPRII enabled BMP4, as well as BMP7, to inhibit proliferation in BMPRII-deficient cells. BMP-mediated growth inhibition was also reconstituted by the BMPRII short isoform, lacking the C-terminal domain present in the long form. BMP4, but not BMP7, induced the expression of osteoblast markers in wild-type cells, whereas neither ligand induced these markers in BMPRII-deficient cells. Overexpression of short or long forms of BMPRII in BMPRII-deficient cells enabled BMP4 and BMP7 to induce osteogenic differentiation. Although signaling via BMPRII or ActRIIa transiently activated SMAD1/5/8, only BMPRII signaling led to persistent SMAD1/5/8 activation and sustained increases in Id1 mRNA and protein expression. Pharmacologic blockade of BMP type I receptor function within 24 h after BMP stimulation abrogated differentiation. These data suggest that sustained BMP pathway activation, such as that mediated by BMPRII, is necessary for growth and differentiation control in vascular smooth muscle. Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signals regulate the growth and differentiation of diverse lineages. The association of mutations in the BMP type II receptor (BMPRII) with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension suggests an important role of this receptor in vascular remodeling. Pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells lacking BMPRII can transduce BMP signals using ActRIIa (Activin type II receptor). We investigated whether or not BMP signaling via the two receptors leads to differential effects on vascular smooth muscle cells. BMP4, but not BMP7, inhibited platelet-derived growth factor-activated proliferation in wild-type pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells, whereas neither ligand inhibited the growth of BMPRII-deficient cells. Adenoviral gene transfer of BMPRII enabled BMP4, as well as BMP7, to inhibit proliferation in BMPRII-deficient cells. BMP-mediated growth inhibition was also reconstituted by the BMPRII short isoform, lacking the C-terminal domain present in the long form. BMP4, but not BMP7, induced the expression of osteoblast markers in wild-type cells, whereas neither ligand induced these markers in BMPRII-deficient cells. Overexpression of short or long forms of BMPRII in BMPRII-deficient cells enabled BMP4 and BMP7 to induce osteogenic differentiation. Although signaling via BMPRII or ActRIIa transiently activated SMAD1/5/8, only BMPRII signaling led to persistent SMAD1/5/8 activation and sustained increases in Id1 mRNA and protein expression. Pharmacologic blockade of BMP type I receptor function within 24 h after BMP stimulation abrogated differentiation. These data suggest that sustained BMP pathway activation, such as that mediated by BMPRII, is necessary for growth and differentiation control in vascular smooth muscle.

Mummery C. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 2000; 44: 253-265PubMed Google Scholar). BMP signals are involved in the commitment of vascular precursor cells in vasculogenesis and regulate the growth, differentiation, and turnover of vascular cell populations (2Moser M. Patterson C.

Mathew S. Saab G. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Further underscoring the importance of BMP signaling in vascular tissues, defects in the BMP signaling apparatus have been linked to two genetic vascular syndromes, hereditary hemorrhagic telangectasia syndrome and idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (4Waite K.A. Eng C. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2003; 4: 763-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). In idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension, diverse loss-of-function mutations in the canonical BMP type II receptor (BMPRII) are associated with the majority of familial and a subset of sporadic cases (6Lane K.B.

Although it has been suggested that defective BMP-mediated regulation of cell differentiation and turnover could contribute to abnormal vascular remodeling, the precise contribution of BMPRII to these functions is incompletely understood.Signaling by BMP ligands is accomplished by at least three type II receptors, BMPRII, ActRIIa, and ActRIIb, and three type I receptors, ALK2, ALK3, and ALK6 (11Liu F.

At least 25 different BMP ligands can facilitate the assembly of type II and type I receptor heteromers to cause phosphorylation and activation of type I receptor kinases by constitutively active type II receptor kinases. Activated type I receptors phosphorylate BMP-responsive SMAD (BR-SMAD) intracellular effectors (SMAD1, -5, and -8). Downstream effects of BR-SMAD activation are mediated in part by the transcription of the dominant negative bHLH Inhibitor of differentiation (Id) proteins, as well as by targets of the Notch signaling pathway (20Dahlqvist C.

The long form possesses a 508-amino acid C-terminal domain distal to the kinase domain that is unique among type II receptors in the TGF-β receptor family. This C-terminal domain is proposed to interact with cytosolic proteins that may modify signaling via pathways other than SMAD (26Beppu H. Minowa O. Miyazono K. Kawabata M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

BR-SMAD activation is limited by several negative feedback mechanisms, including the induction of inhibitory SMAD6 and -7, which act to inhibit type I receptor activity, as well as the activity of SMAD ubiquitin ligases Smurf1 and Smurf2, which target SMADs for proteasomal degradation (32Imamura T.

The specific effects of BMPs vary, depending on the anatomic origin of the VSMC, their state of differentiation or dedifferentiation, and culture conditions, including the presence of cytokine or growth factor stimuli.

On the other hand, BMPs may induce VSMC to express proteins, such as osteoprotegerin (48Tintut Y. Abedin M. Cho J. Choe A. Lim J. Demer L.L. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2005; 39: 389-393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), which may confer protection from vascular calcific and atheromatous disease (50Bennett B.J.

Thus, BMP signals may direct the differentiation of multipotential vascular smooth muscle tissues to contribute to vascular homeostasis and disease.We previously reported that ablation of BMPRII in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMC) did not abolish BMP signals, due to functional redundancy among BMP type II receptors (15Yu P.B. Beppu H. Kawai N. Li E. Bloch K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24443-24450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In BMPRII-deficient cells, preferred ligands for BMPRII, such as BMP2 and BMP4, exhibit diminished SMAD signaling via ActRIIa, whereas BMP7, a high affinity ligand for ActRIIa and ALK2 (51Greenwald J. Groppe J. Gray P. Wiater E. Kwiatkowski W. Vale W. Choe S. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 605-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), exhibits increased signaling. The decrease in signaling by some ligands and increase in signaling by others suggest that disruption of BMPRII could lead to either a net gain or loss of BMP-mediated functions. Here it is shown that disruption of BMPRII leads to the loss of BMP-mediated growth inhibition and osteogenic differentiation in PASMC.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESIsolation of PASMC from Mice with Floxed BMPRII Alleles–Mice possessing BMPRII alleles modified to contain loxP sites flanking exons 4 and 5 (encoding the transmembrane and a portion of the kinase domain) were generated by gene targeting in embryonic stem cells (52Beppu H. Lei H. Bloch K.D. Li E. Genesis. 2005; 41: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Pulmonary artery explants were harvested from mice homozygous for the conditional knockout allele (BMPRIIflox/flox) on a hybrid C57BL/6 and Sv129 background. Intima and adventitia were dissected from media, which was cultured to yield PASMC, whose phenotype was confirmed by typical morphology and immunohistochemical staining for α-smooth muscle actin. Six separate isolates of PASMC were obtained and characterized, each derived from individual BMPRIIflox/flox mice.Adenovirus Infection–To disrupt the BMPRII gene in PASMC isolated from BMPRIIflox/flox mice, cells were infected with adenoviruses expressing Cre (Ad.Cre) or GFP (Ad.GFP) as a control. Virus titers were determined by the plaque titer method (53Chiche J.D. Schlutsmeyer S.M. Bloch D.B. de la Monte S.M. Roberts Jr., J.D. Filippov G. Janssens S.P. Rosenzweig A. Bloch K.D. J. Biol.

After infection, cells were cultured for 5–7 days and passaged, and the expression of BMPRII in the resulting BMPRIIdel/del cells was measured by quantitative RT-PCR and immunoblotting to confirm >99% recombination (15Yu P.B.

In some experiments, cells were also cultured with SB239063 (Sigma), L685,458, DAPT, or dorsomorphin/Compound C (EMD Biosciences, San Diego, CA).Immunoprecipitation of Phosphorylated SMADs–After exposure to BMP ligands for 40 min, cultured PASMC were harvested in a solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl 150, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, protease inhibitor mixture, and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures 1 and 2 (Sigma). Lysates were precipitated with anti-p-SMAD1/5/8 Ab (Cell Signaling; 1:100 dilution) at 4 °C overnight. p-SMAD-Ab complexes were bound to protein A-Sepharose (Sigma), washed extensively with TBS-Tween (0.1%), eluted with buffer (2% SDS in 50 mm dithiothreitol), and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Total activated SMADs in precipitates were detected by immunoblotting with anti-p-SMAD1/5/8. Individual activated SMADs (SMAD1, -5, and -8) were detected using monoclonal anti-murine SMAD1 or SMAD5 Abs (Epitomics) or anti-human SMAD8 Ab (R&D Systems).Measurement of Apoptosis–Subconfluent cells were plated in 8-chamber tissue culture slides in serum-free medium for 48 h. Cells were incubated for an additional 48 h in the presence of cytokines, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde-PBS, and stained with Hoechst 33258 (Sigma) at 1 μg/ml. Apoptotic nuclei (defined by fluorescence intensity and condensed size) were quantitated by NIH Image and divided by total nuclei to determine the frequency of apoptotic cells.Measurement of BMP-induced Id1 Gene Transcription–Subconfluent cells in 12-well tissue culture plates were transfected using Fugene6 (Roche Applied Science) with a plasmid encoding firefly luciferase under the control of the Id1 gene promoter (BRE-Luc, kindly provided by Dr. Peter ten Dijke, Leiden University Medical Center) and a plasmid encoding the Renilla luciferase gene under the control of the thymidine kinase promoter (Promega Corp., Madison, WI), as a transfection control. Id1 transcriptional activity was determined by the ratio of firefly and Renilla luciferase activities, which were measured using the dual luciferase system (Promega).Detection of Alkaline Phosphatase Activity–Cells were seeded at 2 × 103 cells/well into 96-well plates in the presence of 2% fetal calf serum RPMI. BMPs were added to growth medium and incubated at 37 °C for 5 days. Cells were harvested in 50 μl of 1% Triton X-100, and extracts (20 μl) were incubated with 100 μl of p-nitrophenyl phosphate substrate (Sigma). After incubation at 37 °C for 40 min, alkaline phosphatase activity was measured by absorbance at 405 nm. Cell viability was measured using the Cell Titer Glo luminescent viability assay (Promega). Alkaline phosphatase activity was also measured histochemically by seeding 2.6 × 104 cells/well into 12-well plates in 2% fetal calf serum RPMI and culturing in the presence of growth factors or cytokines for 5 days. Cells were then fixed with 0.5% glutaraldehyde-PBS for 5 min, and cells containing enzymatic activity were identified by staining with BM purple (Roche Applied Science).RESULTSDisrupting BMPRII Abrogates Growth Inhibition Mediated by BMP4–PASMC from BMPRIIflox/flox mice were infected with Ad.Cre to generate BMPRdel/del (KO) cells, and BMPRIIflox/flox PASMC after infection with Ad.GFP were used as wild-type (WT) controls (15Yu P.B. Beppu H. Kawai N. Li E. Bloch K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24443-24450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). BMPRII KO cells exhibited <1% residual wild-type BMPRII mRNA expression compared with WT cells and undetectable levels of WT BMPRII protein by Western blotting (15Yu P.B. Beppu H. Kawai N. Li E. Bloch K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24443-24450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). WT and KO PASMC proliferated equally in response to varying concentrations of PDGF-BB, as assayed by [3H]thymidine incorporation (Fig. 1A). WT and KO cells also responded equally to other mitogens, such as bFGF (Fig. 1B) and serum (not shown). Quiescent PASMC exhibited a very low basal rate of proliferation, which was not impacted by treatment with BMP ligands alone (Fig. 1B). However, BMP4 inhibited the PDGF-induced proliferation of WT cells in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 1C). We have previously shown that BMPRII KO cells retain the capacity to transduce BMP signals and activate SMAD1/5/8 via the activity of ActRIIa (15Yu P.B. Beppu H. Kawai N. Li E. Bloch K.D. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1991392461,"Background The clinical attack rate of influenza is influenced by prior immunity and mixing patterns in the host population, and also by the proportion of infections that are asymptomatic. This complexity makes it difficult to directly estimate R0 from the attack rate, contributing to uncertainty in epidemiological models to guide pandemic planning. We have modelled multiple wave outbreaks of influenza from different populations to allow for changing immunity and asymptomatic infection and to make inferences about R0. Data and Methods On the island of Tristan da Cunha (TdC), 96% of residents reported illness during an H3N2 outbreak in 1971, compared with only 25% of RAF personnel in military camps during the 1918 H1N1 pandemic. Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) methods were used to estimate model parameter distributions. Findings We estimated that most islanders on TdC were non-immune (susceptible) before the first wave, and that almost all exposures of susceptible persons caused symptoms. The median R0 of 6.4 (95% credibility interval 3.7–10.7) implied that most islanders were exposed twice, although only a minority became ill in the second wave because of temporary protection following the first wave. In contrast, only 51% of RAF personnel were susceptible before the first wave, and only 38% of exposed susceptibles reported symptoms. R0 in this population was also lower [2.9 (2.3–4.3)], suggesting reduced viral transmission in a partially immune population. Interpretation Our model implies that the RAF population was partially protected before the summer pandemic wave of 1918, arguably because of prior exposure to interpandemic influenza. Without such protection, each symptomatic case of influenza would transmit to between 2 and 10 new cases, with incidence initially doubling every 1–2 days. Containment of a novel virus could be more difficult than hitherto supposed."
https://openalex.org/W2049894216,"In the tephritids Ceratitis capitata and Bactrocera oleae, the gene transformer acts as the memory device for sex determination, via an auto-regulatory function; and functional Tra protein is produced only in females. This paper investigates the evolution of the gene tra, which was characterised in twelve tephritid species belonging to the less extensively analysed genus Anastrepha. Our study provided the following major conclusions. Firstly, the memory device mechanism used by this gene in sex determination in tephritids likely existed in the common ancestor of the Ceratitis, Bactrocera and Anastrepha phylogenetic lineages. This mechanism would represent the ancestral state with respect to the extant cascade seen in the more evolved Drosophila lineage. Secondly, Transformer2-specific binding intronic splicing silencer sites were found in the splicing regulatory region of transformer but not in doublesex pre-mRNAs in these tephritids. Thus, these sites probably provide the discriminating feature for the putative dual splicing activity of the Tra-Tra2 complex in tephritids. It acts as a splicing activator in dsx pre-mRNA splicing (its binding to the female-specific exon promotes the inclusion of this exon into the mature mRNA), and as a splicing inhibitor in tra pre-mRNA splicing (its binding to the male-specific exons prevents the inclusion of these exons into the mature mRNA). Further, a highly conserved region was found in the specific amino-terminal region of the tephritid Tra protein that might be involved in Tra auto-regulatory function and hence in its repressive splicing behaviour. Finally, the Tra proteins conserved the SR dipeptides, which are essential for Tra functionality."
https://openalex.org/W2040231284,"Waardenburg syndrome (WS) is an inherited sensorineural deafness condition in humans caused by melanocyte deficiencies in the inner ear and forelock. Mutation of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) is known to produce WS type IIA whereas mutations of either endothelin (EDN) or its receptor endothelin receptor B (EDNRB) produce WS type IV. However, a link between MITF haploinsufficiency and EDN signaling has not yet been established. Here we demonstrate mechanistic connections between EDN and MITF and their functional importance in melanocytes. Addition of EDN to cultured human melanocytes stimulated the phosphorylation of MITF in an EDNRB-dependent manner, which was completely abolished by mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibition. The expression of melanocyte-specific MITF mRNA transcripts was markedly augmented after incubation with EDN1 and was followed by increased expression of MITF protein. Up-regulated expression of MITF was found to be mediated via both the mitogen-activated protein kinase-p90 ribosomal S6 kinase-cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and cAMP-protein kinase A-CREB pathways. In addition, EDNRB expression itself was seen to be dependent on MITF. The functional importance of these connections is illustrated by the ability of EDN to stimulate expression of melanocytic pigmentation and proliferation markers in an MITF-dependent fashion. Collectively these data provide mechanistic and epistatic links between MITF and EDN/EDNRB, critical melanocytic survival factors and WS genes."
https://openalex.org/W2137321379,"Increased exposure of the tubular epithelium to filtered protein is a proposed mechanism of progressive renal failure associated with glomerular disease, but how this protein overload translates into tubular damage remains unclear. We have examined a model of adriamycin-induced proteinuria to determine the effect of locally synthesized C3, the central proinflammatory protein of the complement cascade. C3-/- kidney isografts placed in wild-type C3+/+ mice were protected from proteinuria-associated complement activation, tubular damage, and progressive renal failure despite the presence of abundant circulating C3. The quantity of urinary protein was unaffected by the absence of C3, and thus the influence of C3 was not explained by alteration in the filtered protein load. These results suggest that local synthesis of complement from renal epithelial cells is a critical mediator of tubular damage in proteinuria-associated renal disease. Our results concur with previous findings of increased synthesis of C3 in human tubular epithelium exposed to high concentrations of protein in vitro. Because progressive renal damage in humans associates with proteinuria regardless of cause, our findings have implications for the pathogenesis and treatment of renal failure from many common causes, immunological and nonimmunological."
https://openalex.org/W2063937428,"CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CT) is the key regulatory enzyme in the CDP-choline pathway for the biosynthesis of phosphatidylcholine (PC). We previously generated a mouse in which the hepatic CTα gene was specifically inactivated by the cre/loxP procedure. In CTα knock-out mice, plasma high density lipoprotein (HDL) and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) levels were markedly lower than in wild type mice (Jacobs, R. L., Devlin, C., Tabas, I., and Vance, D. E. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 47402-47410.) To investigate the mechanism(s) responsible for the decrease in plasma lipoprotein levels, we isolated primary hepatocytes from knock-out and wild type mice. ABCA1 expression was reduced in knock-out hepatocytes and apoAI-dependent cholesterol, and PC efflux was impaired. When knock-out hepatocytes were infected with an adenovirus expressing CTα, apoAI-dependent PC efflux returned partially, whereas cholesterol efflux and ABCA1 levels were not restored to normal levels. Adenoviral expression of CTα did not increase VLDL secretion in knock-out hepatocytes, even though cellular PC levels returned to normal. However, in vivo adenoviral delivery of CTα normalized plasma HDL and VLDL levels in knock-out mice. The observations demonstrate that hepatic PC biosynthesis is a key player in maintaining plasma VLDL and HDL, and further underscores the importance of the liver in HDL formation.

The gene product of Pcyt1a, CTα, is believed to be the predominant isoform in liver (6Jacobs R.L. Devlin C. Tabas I. Vance D.E. J. Biol.

The function of both PC biosynthetic pathways has been a topic of interest in our laboratory for many years. Recently, we generated mice deficient in either PEMT or hepatic CTα, allowing us to gain insight into the role of these pathways in lipid metabolism. Pemt-/- mice appear normal when fed a chow diet, suggesting that the CDP-choline pathway is sufficient for life, providing that dietary choline is available (12Walkey C.J. Donohue L.R. Bronson R.

Nutr. 2002; 132: 68-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, a specific role for PEMT in VLDL secretion has been demonstrated in vivo and in hepatocyte experiments (15Noga A.A. Zhao Y. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42358-42365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 16Noga A.A. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21851-21859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In male Pemt-/- mice fed a high fat/cholesterol diet, plasma triacylglycerol (TG) and PC levels were decreased compared with controls (16Noga A.A. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21851-21859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In Pemt-/- hepatocytes, apoB100 and TG secretion was reduced by 60 and 75%, respectively (16Noga A.A. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21851-21859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). This reduction in VLDL secretion in the Pemt-/- mice occurred even though hepatic CT activity was increased nearly 2-fold (17Noga A.A. Vance D.E. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 1998-2005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Furthermore, hepatic PC mass was the same in Pemt-/- mice and wild type littermates (16Noga A.A. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21851-21859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). These studies demonstrate that CT does not compensate for the lack of PEMT activity. Thus it appears that PEMT-derived PC is important in maintaining VLDL secretion from hepatocytes. The function of CTα has been investigated in several genetically modified mouse models. Global loss of CTα expression is lethal at embryonic day E3.5 (18Wang L. Magdaleno S. Tabas I. Jackowski S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 3357-3363Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Tissue-specific deletion of CTα has been performed in macrophages (19Zhang D. Tang W. Yao P.M. Yang C. Xie B.

Biol. 2007; 27: 975-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) have shown that CTα is not essential for proliferation or differentiation of lung epithelia. However, pulmonary CTα is essential for the synthesis and secretion of PC in lung surfactant. Without normal PC secretion, lungs fail to inflate at birth, accumulate TG, and have abnormal lamellar bodies. Similarly, CTα is not essential in the development of macrophages but is necessary to protect against cholesterol-induced cell death (19Zhang D. Tang W. Yao P.M. Yang C. Xie B. Jackowski S. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35368-35376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We previously reported that mice lacking hepatic CTα are viable and fertile. However, as a result of impaired CT activity, the mass of PC in the liver is reduced by 6-25%, whereas TG accumulates (6Jacobs R.L. Devlin C. Tabas I. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47402-47410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the levels of plasma lipoprotein cholesterol, TG, and PC are markedly reduced. The reduction of plasma TG is likely due to decreased secretion of VLDL from the liver (6Jacobs R.L. Devlin C. Tabas I. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47402-47410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In contrast to VLDL secretion, the link between hepatic PC production and high density lipoprotein (HDL) metabolism has not been studied thoroughly. Unlike VLDL, choline deficiency does not reduce plasma HDL levels in rats (21Yao Z.M. Vance D.E. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1990; 68: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the amount of PC, cholesterol, or apoAI in the medium from hepatocytes incubated with choline- and methionine-deficient medium is not reduced (22Yao Z.M. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2998-3004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was therefore unexpected that both the Pemt-/- mice and the liver-specific CTα knock-out mice had lower HDL than their respective wild type littermates (6Jacobs R.L. Devlin C. Tabas I. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47402-47410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 16Noga A.A. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21851-21859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Moreover, liver-specific deletion of the ATP-binding cassette transporter 1 (ABCA1), which mobilizes both cellular phospholipids and cholesterol to lipid-poor apoAI, reduces plasma HDL-cholesterol by 80% (23Timmins J.M. Lee J.Y. Boudyguina E. Kluckman K.D. Brunham L.R. Mulya A. Gebre A.K. Coutinho J.M. Colvin P.L. Smith T.L. Hayden M.R. Maeda N. Parks J.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 1333-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). We considered the possibility that impairment of PC biosynthesis reduces the amount of PC available for lipidation of apoAI and results in decreased levels of plasma HDL. Thus, using CTα-deficient hepatocytes as a model, we investigated whether or not impaired PC biosynthesis decreases HDL formation. We predicted that both VLDL secretion and HDL formation would be impaired in CTα-deficient hepatocytes. We also hypothesized that if CT activity were re-established, via adenoviral gene delivery, ample PC would be available to normalize both VLDL and HDL formation. Materials—Sheep anti-human apoB antibody was purchased from Roche Applied Science, and rabbit anti-human apoAI antibody was from Biodesigns (Kennebunk, ME). Anti-goat hemagglutinin (HA) and anti-rabbit lamin A/C antibodies were purchased from Sigma and Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), respectively. Texas Red-X goat anti-mouse and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit antibodies were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Donkey anti-sheep antibodies and goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were purchased from Pierce. All other chemicals and reagents were from standard commercial sources. Anti-ABCA1 antibody was purchased from Novus Biologicals, Inc. (Littleton, CO). Animal Care—All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care Committee, University of Alberta, and were in accordance with guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care. Female mice (3-6 months old) were fed ad libitum a chow diet (PicoLab Rodent Diet 20) or a semi-purified (F3282, BioServ) diet and were exposed to a 12-h light/dark cycle starting at 8:00 a.m. Primary Hepatocyte Isolation and Culture—Primary hepatocytes were isolated by collagenase perfusion and plated on 60-mm collagen-coated dishes at a density of 1.0 × 106 cells/dish in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Two h after plating, the cultures were rinsed twice in serum-free DMEM over a 1-h period. For experiments on VLDL secretion, hepatocytes were incubated in serum-free DMEM for 10-16 h. Medium was concentrated using Amicon® ultracentrifugal filter devices (Millipore). Lipid Efflux from Hepatocytes—Hepatocytes were washed twice with FBS-free DMEM and then incubated with FBS-free DMEM containing [3H]mevalonate (10 μCi/ml) and [3H]choline (5 μCi/ml) for 4 h. The cells were then washed twice with cold FBS-free DMEM and incubated with FBS-free DMEM with or without exogenous apoAI (10 μg/ml) for 3-9 h. Lipids from cells and medium were extracted (24Folch J. Lees M. Stanley G.H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and separated by thin layer chromatography, and the radiolabel associated with PC and cholesterol was measured with a scintillation counter (25Jacobs R.L. Lingrell S. Dyck J.R. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 4516-4523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Lipid efflux was calculated as a percentage of counts in the media divided by the total of the counts in cells and media. Adenoviral Infection of Hepatocytes—To construct recombinant adenovirus, a cDNA encoding an HA-tagged CTα was subcloned into a pAdTrack-CMV shuttle vector, linearized with PmeI, and inserted into adenovirus using pAdEasy-1 system for homologous recombination in Escherichia coli (26He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3256) Google Scholar). The pAdTrack-CMV shuttle vector also contained a gene encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP). Therefore, the adenovirus used to express CTα protein also expressed GFP, which served as a marker of successful viral infection and protein expression. Fluorescent titering was used to estimate the concentration of each adenovirus preparation. In some experiments, hepatocytes were infected with Ad.GFP or Ad.CTα (2 plaque-forming units/cell) for 16 h before the start of the experiment. Confocal Microscopy—COS cells were seeded onto 22-mm coverslips in 6-well plates at a density of 0.5 × 105 cells/well. Following overnight incubation at 37 °C, 5% CO2, the cells were transfected with pCI plasmids encoding HA-tagged CTα. Twenty four h post-transfection, cells were serum-starved for 1 h and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7, for 10 min. Following permeabilization with 0.2% Triton X-100/phosphate-buffered saline for 2 min, cells were incubated with the first primary antibody (anti-lamin A/C, 1:100) at 37 °C for 1 h. The cells were then incubated with the second primary antibody (monoclonal anti-HA, 1:150) for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were subsequently incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with both secondary antibodies, Texas Red-X goat anti-mouse (1:200) and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit (1:200). Coverslips were mounted onto slides with Prolong Antifade™ reagent, and immunofluorescence was visualized using a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope. McArdle RH-7777 Cell Culture and Stable Transfection—McArdle cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS and 10% (v/v) horse serum at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. The cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation method with either pcDNA3.1-CTα or pcDNA3.1 vector, which encodes for neomycin resistance. The cDNA for rat CTα without an HA tag was used in these experiments. Stable colonies were selected in culture medium containing 400 μg/ml G418 and maintained in medium containing 200 μg/ml G418. Triplicate 60-mm dishes of cells (1 × 106 cells/dish) were seeded 20 h before the start of the experiment. The cells were incubated in serum-free DMEM containing 0.4 mm oleate/bovine serum albumin for 30 min. The medium was replaced with DMEM that contained 10 μCi of [3H]glycerol in the presence of 0.4 mm oleate/bovine serum albumin for 4 h. The lipids were extracted and fractionated by thin layer chromatography, and radioactivity was determined. Injection of Recombinant Adenoviruses—A single dose of Ad.GFP or Ad.CT (1.0 × 109 plaque-forming units) was injected into female wild type or knock-out mice via the tail vein. Seven days after injection, the mice were fasted (16 h) and anesthetized with metofane. A blood sample was drawn and plasma retained. Livers were dissected immediately and stored at -80 °C for further analysis. Immunoblot Analyses—Homogenates (40 μg of protein) or concentrated medium was boiled in buffer containing 1% SDS, and proteins were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred to an Immobilon-P transfer membrane and probed with anti-GFP (dilution 1:5000), anti-HA (dilution 1:5000), anti-ABCA1 (dilution 1:1000), anti-apoAI (dilution 1:10,000), anti-albumin (dilution 1:5000), or anti-apoB (dilution 1:5000) antibodies. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Determination of Lipid Mass—The amount of cholesterol, cholesteryl ester, and TG was determined in liver/cell homogenates (0.5 mg of protein), hepatocyte-conditioned medium (3 ml), and plasma (100 μl). After digestion (2 h, 30 °C) of the phospholipids with phospholipase C, tridecanoin (20 ng) was added as an internal standard, and lipids were extracted. The mass of TG, cholesterol, and cholesteryl ester was determined by gas-liquid chromatography (27Myher J.J. Kuksis A. Pind S. Lipids. 1989; 24: 408-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Phospholipids were separated by thin layer chromatography, and the mass of PC and PE was determined via a lipid phosphorus assay (28Zhou X. Arthur G. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 1233-1236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For visualization of lipid droplets, hepatocytes were plated onto 24-well plates at a density of 0.5 × 105 cells/well. After 1 h of incubation in serum-free medium, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.0, for 10 min at room temperature. Following three washes with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were incubated with 2 μg/ml BODIPY (Molecular Probes, number 3922) for 20 min, washed three more times with phosphate-buffered saline, and images acquired using a fluorescence microscope. Analysis of Plasma and Medium Lipoprotein Lipid Profiles—Plasma or hepatocyte-conditioned medium was separated into lipoprotein fractions using high performance liquid chromatography with an Amersham Biosciences Superose 6 column attached to a Beckman Systems Gold or Nouveau Gold apparatus. In-line assays for total cholesterol (Sigma Infinity cholesterol reagent), TG (Sigma triglyceride GPO Trinder kit), and PC (Sigma phospholipids B kit) were performed as described previously (6Jacobs R.L. Devlin C. Tabas I. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47402-47410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as means ± S.D. unless otherwise noted. Each experimental group contained three to four samples. Analysis of variance was performed to compare means unless otherwise specified. A p value of <0.05 was considered to be significant. VLDL Secretion Is Impaired in CTα-deficient Hepatocytes—Hepatocytes isolated from wild type and hepatic CTα knockout mice were incubated in serum-free DMEM for 16 h. As shown in Fig. 1A, CTα-deficient hepatocytes secrete ∼50% less PC and TG into the medium compared with wild type cells. Furthermore, apoB48 secretion was reduced by ∼50% in knock-out hepatocytes, whereas apoB100 secretion was almost completely abolished (Fig. 1B). Diminished VLDL secretion from CTα-deficient cells correlated with a 2-fold increase in hepatocyte TG (Fig. 1C), which accumulated in large lipid droplets (Fig. 1D). Interestingly, these large lipid droplets were predominantly peri-nuclear compared with lipid droplets in control cells, which accumulated more in the cell periphery. The decrease in VLDL secretion and accumulation of intracellular TG in knock-out cells may have been a result of altered phospholipid concentration because cellular PC levels were reduced by 30% (Fig. 1C). ABCA1-mediated Lipid Efflux Is Decreased in CTα-deficient Hepatocytes—We previously reported that plasma HDL (cholesterol and apoAI) levels were reduced in the liver-specific CTα knock-out mouse (6Jacobs R.L. Devlin C. Tabas I. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47402-47410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). To evaluate the role of hepatic CTα in HDL formation, we incubated wild type and knock-out hepatocytes in the presence or absence of apoAI. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, the efflux of [3H]PC and [3H]cholesterol from wild type and knock-out hepatocytes was linear for at least 9 h. The release of [3H]PC and [3H]cholesterol from wild type hepatocytes was stimulated by ∼2- and 3-fold by apoAI, respectively. In knock-out cells, apoAI induced a 2-fold increase of [3H]cholesterol secretion into the medium but did not increase the amount of [3H]PC released. Therefore, knock-out hepatocytes effluxed less lipids to apoAI compared with control cells. The mass of cholesterol in the culture medium was also determined after 10 h of incubation and confirmed that knock-out hepatocytes had impaired apoAI-induced cholesterol efflux (Fig. 2E). Endogenous apoAI secretion was not altered by genotype (Fig. 1B), and the lipid efflux experiments showed that apoAI was lipidated normally (Fig. 2, A-C). Fast protein liquid chromatography analysis of the lipoproteins secreted by cells incubated with exogenous apoAI recapitulated the impairment in HDL formation in the knock-out mice (Fig. 2D). One surprising result was that the size of HDL was larger in the medium taken from knock-out hepatocytes compared with controls (Fig. 2D). This result is consistent, however, with the results in Fig. 2B, which show that [3H]cholesterol efflux was stimulated in knock-out hepatocytes by apoAI without increased efflux of [3H]PC. The membrane protein ABCA1 plays a critical role in HDL formation by facilitating the efflux of cellular lipids to an apolipoprotein acceptor (29Van Eck M. Pennings M. Hoekstra M. Out R. Van Berkel T.J. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2005; 16: 307-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). With this in mind, hepatocytes were homogenized and the levels of ABCA1 protein evaluated (Fig. 2F). In agreement with the efflux assay, ABCA1 protein levels were reduced by ∼50% in CTα-deficient hepatocytes. Adenoviral Expression of CTα Normalizes PC Levels in Knock-out Hepatocytes—To test whether the impairment of lipid secretion was reversible in knock-out hepatocytes, we created a recombinant adenovirus that expresses an HA-tagged CTα cDNA. A pCI expression vector containing the tagged CTα cDNA was transiently transfected into COS cells, and the expressed enzyme was shown to have in vitro activity and to stimulate [3H]choline incorporation into PC (data not shown). Furthermore, the protein was properly located within the nucleus (Fig. 3A). When hepatocytes were infected with the adenovirus, the expected bands for CTα and/or GFP were detected by immunoblotting (Fig. 3B). Adenoviral expression of CTα in wild type hepatocytes resulted in a 2-fold increase in incorporation of radioactivity in PC from either [3H]choline (Fig. 3C) or [3H]glycerol (Fig. 3D). As reported previously (6Jacobs R.L. Devlin C. Tabas I. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47402-47410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), choline-dependent PC biosynthesis was reduced by 85% in CTα-deficient hepatocytes, whereas total PC production was reduced by 60%. Adenoviral CTα infection of knock-out cells resulted in a 10- and 5-fold increase in [3H]choline and [3H]glycerol incorporation into PC, respectively. Therefore, after adenoviral infection the apparent rate of hepatic PC biosynthesis was equal in knock-out and wild type cells. The mass of PC was 30% lower in knock-out hepatocytes compared with control cells (Fig. 3E). Ad.CTα infection restored PC mass to control levels without altering the mass of PE (Fig. 3F). Interestingly, PC mass in wild type cells was not increased following adenoviral infection, suggesting increased turnover of newly formed PC in these cells. Indeed, following an 8-h chase, the disappearance of radiolabeled PC was greater in control cells infected with Ad.CT (38 ± 6%) versus those treated with Ad.GFP (8 ± 5%, p < 0.05). However, the turnover of PC in knock-out cells was not significantly increased by CT overexpression (PC disappearance (% initial),: Ad.GFP = 9 ± 6% versus Ad.CT = 17 ± 10%, p = 0.32). Adenoviral Expression of CTα Partially Restores Lipid Efflux to ApoAI in Knock-out Hepatocytes—To investigate whether or not lipid efflux was altered by adenoviral expression of CTα, we incubated hepatocytes with or without apoAI following Ad.GFP or Ad.CTα infection. Overexpression of CTα in wild type hepatocytes did not alter the mass of PC or cholesterol effluxed to apoAI (Fig. 4, A and B). However, when Ad.CTα-infected knock-out cells were treated with apoAI, the amount of PC in the medium increased by 30% compared with that in Ad.GFP-treated hepatocytes, although PC efflux remained lower than that in wild type cells. Similar experiments measuring the efflux of [3H]cholesterol and [3H]PC were performed (Fig. 4, C and D). Ad.CTα infection of knock-out hepatocytes completely normalized PC efflux to apoAI (Fig. 4C). The size of the HDL in the medium of knock-out cells was also partially returned to normal (Fig. 4E). Interestingly, however, cholesterol efflux to apoAI was not significantly increased following Ad.CTα, which suggests that restoring the total amount of cellular PC was not sufficient to restore HDL formation in knockout hepatocytes. To understand why HDL formation was not completely normalized by adenoviral expression of CTα, we evaluated the levels of cellular ABCA1. Although PC levels returned to normal following adenoviral induced overexpression of CTα, ABCA1 protein levels did not increase in knock-out hepatocytes (Fig. 4F) incubated with Ad.CTα. ABCA1 was also not changed in wild type cells expressing adenoviral CTα. Adenoviral Expression of CTα Does Not Increase VLDL Secretion from Hepatocytes—Many studies have shown a link between reduced hepatic PC biosynthesis and impaired VLDL-TG secretion (15Noga A.A. Zhao Y. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42358-42365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 16Noga A.A. Vance D.E. J. Biol.

Therefore, we predicted that adenoviral expression of CTα, which normalized cellular PC mass, would increase VLDL secretion in knock-out hepatocytes. However, the amount of VLDL-TG secreted from knockout cells was not altered by Ad.CTα infection (Fig. 5, A and B). Unexpectedly, overexpression of CTα in wild type cells, which did not alter cellular PC levels, resulted in a 50% reduction in TG secretion (Fig. 5B). Infection of cells with Ad.CTα did not alter cellular TG or cholesterol levels in either control or knockout hepatocytes (data not shown). Because it appears that overexpression of CTα in normal cells causes a defect in VLDL secretion, we reasoned that overexpression of CTα in McArdle rat hepatoma cells would provide the same result. Therefore, we transfected McArdle cells with a cDNA encoding CTα under control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. Three stable cell lines, with low (2×), medium (10×), and high (20×) CTα overexpression (data not shown) were selected to study VLDL secretion. The vector-transfected cells, co"

The gene maps to the 22q11.2 schizophrenia susceptibility locus and is thus a strong functional and positional candidate gene.We evaluate evidence for genetic association between common RTN4R polymorphisms and schizophrenia in a large family sample of Afrikaner origin and screen the exonic sequence of RTN4R for rare variants in an independent sample from the U.S. We also employ animal model studies to assay a panel of schizophrenia-related behavioral tasks in an Rtn4r-deficient mouse model. We found weak sex-specific evidence for association between common RTN4R polymorphisms and schizophrenia in the Afrikaner patients. In the U.S. sample, we identified two novel non-conservative RTN4R coding variants in two patients with schizophrenia that were absent in 600 control chromosomes. In our complementary mouse model studies, we identified a haploinsufficient effect of Rtn4r on locomotor activity, but normal performance in schizophrenia-related behavioral tasks. We also provide evidence that Rtn4r deficiency can modulate the long-term behavioral effects of transient postnatal N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor hypofunction.Our results do not support a major role of RTN4R in susceptibility to schizophrenia or the cognitive and behavioral deficits observed in individuals with 22q11 microdeletions. However, they suggest that RTN4R may modulate the genetic risk or clinical expression of schizophrenia in a subset of patients and identify additional studies that will be necessary to clarify the role of RTN4R in psychiatric phenotypes. In addition, our results raise interesting issues about evaluating the significance of rare genetic variants in disease and their role in causation."

For IL-1-induced IL-6biosynthesis, the role of p38 is involved in vivo atpost-transcriptional level is poorly understood.

The forward primer for 3′-UTR-(1–70) was the same as thatfor the full length; the reverse primer was5′-CCTCTAGAACAACAGGAT-3′. The forward primer for3′-UTR-(56–173) was5′-CCTCTAGAAATATATCCTGTTGTCAGGTAT-3′; the reverse primer was5′-CCTCTAGAAGTTTACTTAT-3′. The forward primer for3′-UTR-(172–403) was5′-GGACTCTAGACTTTAAGTTAATTTATG-3′; the reverse primer was the sameas for the full length. All ARE mutants were generated by PCR-directedmutagenesis with anchor primers and mutagenic primers. The forward mutagenicprimers were: M1, 5′-TTAAGGGATTGATAATTTAAATAAG-3′; M2,5′-TGATAAGGGAAATAAGTAAACTTAAG-3′; M3,5′-AGTTAAGGGATGATTGATATTTATTATTTTTATG-3′; M4,5′-TGATAGGGATTATTTTTATGAAGTGTCACTT-3′; and M5,5′-GCTAAGGGAAATATGTTTTTAAAGAAATCCTTG-3′. The reversemutagenic primers were: M1,5′-TATCAATCCCTTAAAAATAATTAAAATAG-3′; M2,5′-TTATTTCCCTTATCAATAAATTAAAAAT-3′; M3,5′-ATCATCCCTTAACTTAAAGTTTACTTAT-3′; M4,5′-AATAATCCCTATCAATCATAAATTAACTT-3′; and M5,5′-ATATTTCCCTTAGCAATTCATTGGGT-3′. All plasmids weresequenced to verify authenticity. Luciferase Assay—Luciferase activity was determined using aluciferase assay system, following the manufacturer's protocol (Promega,Madison, WI) Briefly, cell monolayers in 12-well plates were removed byscraping into 200 μl of reporter lysis buffer. Cells were vortexed, andcellular debris was removed by centrifugation (30 s at 12,000 ×g). Luciferase activity was measured using a luminometer (LMaxII 384,Molecular Devices). A Renilla luciferase reporter vector was includedin every experiment for transfection efficiency control. Relative luciferaseactivity was determined and normalized to Renilla luciferaseactivity. Northern Blot—RNA was prepared from actively growing cellsby using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) as specified by the manufacturer. 10μg of RNAs was separated in 1.25% Seakem® gold-agarose, transferredonto a nylon membrane (GeneScreen Plus, Dupont), and cross-linked by UVtreatment (Stratalinker apparatus). The membrane was hybridized in ULTRA Hybsolution (Ambion), using 32P-labeled firefly luciferase probe(nucleotides 491–1049). The mRNA levels were normalized by 28 S RNA. Reverse Transcription-PCR and Quantitative Real-timePCR—IL-6 mRNA expression was analyzed by reverse transcription-PCRand quantitative real-time PCR. First strand cDNA was synthesized from RNA(600 ng) using SuperScript® III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Firststrand cDNA was used for PCR with specific oligonucleotide primers for mIL-6:forward, 5′-ATGAAGTTCCTCTCTGCAAGAGACT-3′; reverse,5′-CACTAGGTTTGCCGAGTAGATCTC-3′. Quantitative real-time PCR withprimers were designed by Applied Biosystems (mIL-6, mm00446190; mGAPDH,mm99999915) using an ABI7500 thermocycler, and the gene expression wasanalyzed by using 7500 System SDS v1.4 software. RNA Secondary Structure and Analysis—RNA secondary structureanalysis was performed using the M-fold program(28Zuker M. MethodsEnzymol. 1989; 180: 262-288Google Scholar). The folding temperaturewas fixed at 37 °C. Statistical Analysis—Student t tests were utilizedto obtain individual p values using GraphPad Prism version 4.03 forWindows, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA. p38α Mediates IL-1 Receptor-induced IL-6Production—To investigate the in vivo function ofp38α in the mechanism of IL-6 production, MEFs were prepared fromp38α+/+ and p38α–/– mouseembryos and stimulated with IL-1β, Escherichia coli LPS andTNFα for 24 h. IL-6 content from culture supernatant was analyzed byenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Fig.1A). Remarkably, p38α–/–MEFs incubated with IL-1β show significantly decreased amounts of IL-6production compared with p38α+/+ MEFs. E. coli LPS,and TNFα did not induce the dramatic differences of IL-6 productionbetween wild-type and p38α–/– MEFs. To confirm that this defect was caused by p38α deficiency rather thangenetic mutations associated with IL-1R signaling, wild-type p38α andkinase-dead p38 (AF) cDNAs were transiently transfected into MEFs, and IL-6production induced by IL-1β measured. Results indicate that wild-typep38α but not p38AF restored the IL-6 production inp38α–/– MEFs(Fig. 1B). Incontrast, overexpression of p38α in p38α+/+ MEFsproduced IL-6 in amounts similar to those of parental control cells. Asexpected, overexpression of kinase-dead p38AF decreased the IL-6 production inp38α+/+ MEFs. Interestingly, IL-6 production inp38α–/– MEFs was also decreased by p38AFoverexpression. These data strongly indicate that p38α is critical forIL-1R-induced IL-6 production. p38α Stabilizes Endogenous IL-6 mRNA—Previousdata have indicated that the stability of IL-6 mRNA is regulated by MK2 via anAU-rich 3′-UTR of the IL-6 mRNA(29Neininger A. Kontoyiannis D. Kotlyarov A. Winzen R. Eckert R. Volk H.D. Holtmann H. Kollias G. Gaestel M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3065-3068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). To confirm whetherp38α signaling was required for IL-6 mRNA turnover, the stability ofendogenous IL-6 mRNA transcripts were monitored by actinomycin D pulse chase.After 24 h of IL-1β treatment with or without SB203580 (p38αinhibitor), actinomycin D was added to p38α+/+ MEFs, and IL-6mRNA levels were measured at the indicated time points. The addition ofSB203580 resulted in a rapid decrease in IL-6 mRNA level(Fig. 2A). The densitywas measured and shown in Fig.2B. The analysis revealed that SB203580 decreased IL-6mRNA t½ from 3.7 to 1.7 h. Importantly, thestability of endogenous IL-6 mRNA was compared in the p38α+/+and p38α–/– MEFs. After MEFs were stimulated byIL-1β for 24 h, actinomycin D was added, and IL-6 mRNA levels weremeasured by real-time PCR. Fig.2C shows a relative shorter half-life inp38α–/– MEFs (t½ = 1.9h) compare with p38α+/+ cells (t½= 4.6 h) indicating that IL-6 mRNA is stabilized by p38α. p38α Targets IL-6 3′-UTR to Promote mRNAStability—Because AREs in the 3′-UTR of many cytokine mRNAsare responsible for both translational control and mRNA stability, we examinedwhether the ARE-containing 3′-UTR of IL-6 is sufficient to conferp38-dependent stabilization to a reporter mRNA. The full length of3′-UTR of IL-6 contains five AREs with no overlapping pentanucleotideAUUUA core motifs. Instead, the AUUUA motifs are scattered throughout the IL-63′-UTR where both the human and mouse IL-6 3′-UTR exhibit highhomology to each other(30Stoecklin G. Stoeckle P. Lu M. Muehlemann O. Moroni C. Rna. 2001; 7: 1578-1588PubMed Google Scholar). To clarify the functional role, the full-length 3′-UTR was insertedinto the 3′-UTR of the luciferase reporter gene and transientlytransfected into p38α+/+ andp38α–/– MEF cells. The mRNA stability ofluciferase reporter transcript was measured following addition of actinomycinD. As shown in Fig. 3 (A andB), IL6-3′-UTR was sufficient to elicit rapidluciferase mRNA decay in p38α–/– MEFs with ahalf-life of 8.6 h compared with p38α+/+ MEFs(t½ = 13 h). In contrast, luciferase mRNA lackingIL-6 3′-UTR was stable during a 5-h period in p38α+/+and p38α–/– MEFs. These data indicate thatp38α stabilized mRNA via IL-6 3′-UTR. Proximal AREs Contain Elements Targeted by p38α—Toinvestigate the role of individual AUUUA motifs in mediatingpost-transcriptional control regulated by p38α, a series of luciferasereporter-gene constructs, containing the various regions of IL-6 3′-UTRand the motifs mutated from AUUUA to AGGGA, were generated(Fig. 4A) andtransiently expressed in MEFs. The luciferase activity of the full-length3′-UTR and all truncations was compared first in the individual celltype. For the p38α+/+ MEFs, when the full-length3′-UTR-(1–403) was placed in the reporter message, luciferaseactivity decreased more than 30% compared with luciferase alone(Fig. 4B). These dataindicate that the 3′-UTR contains the elements that confer mRNAstability and/or translational efficiency. The pGL3-IL-6ARE-(56–173)truncation reporter includes the two proximal AREs (ARE1 and ARE2), whereasthe three distal AREs (ARE3, ARE4, and ARE5) are included in pGL3-IL-63′-UTR-(172–403). The decreased expression was lost in bothpGL3-IL-6 3′-UTR-(56–173) and pGL3-IL-63′-UTR-(172–403) compared with the full-length3′-UTR-(1–403), suggesting that multiple control elements wereoperative. Whereas in the p38α–/– MEFs, theluciferase activity of the full-length 3′-UTR decreased more than 50%compared with luciferase alone and the significant decreased expression stilloccurred in the presence of both proximal and distal truncations. This resultindicated that p38α was involved when these multiple elements mediatedpost-transcriptional control. When the truncation pGL3-IL-63′-UTR-(1–70), which includes none of the AREs was inserted in thereporter message, luciferase activity in both wild-type andp38α–/– MEFs was comparable with the control.These data indicate that the decreased expression only occurred in thepresence of AUUUA motifs. To confirm the involvement of p38α clearly, a further comparison ofluciferase activity between p38α+/+ andp38α–/– MEFs was analyzed. Again, for thefull-length IL-6 3′-UTR-(1–403), pGL3-IL-63′-UTR-(56–173), and pGL3-IL-6 3′-UTR-(172–403), theluciferase activity in p38α–/– MEFs decreasedsignificantly compared with p38α+/+ cells (p <0.01). As shown in Fig.4D, p38α enhanced luciferase mRNA stability via thefull length of IL-6-3′-UTR. To confirm the cis-elementstargeted by p38α, the luciferase reporter mRNA stability of truncatedreporter constructs was examined in p38α+/+ andp38α–/– MEF. As shown inFig. 5, IL-63′-UTR-(56–173) elicited the rapid luciferase mRNA decay inp38α–/– MEFs (t½ = 3.5h), whereas the mRNA contained with IL-6 3′-UTR-(172–403) appearedto be more stable compared with 3′-UTR-(56–173)(t½ = 6.1 h) indicating that p38α targets the3′-UTR-(56–173) region to stabilize IL-6 mRNA. To estimate the influence of the individual AREs, AUUUA motifs were mutatedindividually and transiently expressed in MEFs. In p38α+/+MEFs, the luciferase activity of Mu3 increased significantly compared withfull-length 3′-UTR (p < 0.05) but still was significantlylower than that of control (p < 0.05). For the Mu5, the luciferaseactivity decreased another 20% compared with full-length 3′-UTR. Thisresult indicated that ARE3 included the major repressive element, whereas ARE5bears an enhancive element. In the p38α–/– MEFs,the luciferase activity of Mu1–4 increased significantly compared withfull-length 3′-UTR, whereas Mu5 was comparable. Again, the luciferase activity of all mutants betweenp38α+/+ and p38α–/– MEFs wascompared. After the individual ARE motifs mutated, the significant differencedue to the p38α deficiency was lost for M1, M2, and M5, whereas theluciferase activity of M3 and M4 were still significantly lower inp38α–/– MEFs compared withp38α+/+ cells suggesting that ARE1, -2, and -5 were theelements targeted by p38α. Secondary structure prediction of IL-6 3′-UTR and mutants. AlthoughRNA-binding proteins bind RNA in a sequence-specific manner, previous studieshave indicated that RNA secondary structure plays a critical role in defining3′-UTR RNA-protein interaction. Binding sites are often located insingle-stranded RNA region(31Hiller M. Pudimat R. Busch A. Backofen R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: e117Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Using M-fold, thesecondary structures of IL-6 3′-UTR and mutants were predicted(Fig. 6). For wild-type3′-UTR, ARE2 and ARE5 comprised the sequence to form the external loopstructures (LoopA and LoopD), whereas ARE3 and ARE4 formed the internal loopstructures (LoopB and LoopC). ARE1 formed the stem adjacent to the externalLoopA. Mutation of ARE1 and ARE2 abolished external LoopA, and mutation of ARE5abolished external LoopD, whereas mutation of ARE3 and ARE4 had a relativelyminor effect on the secondary structure. Consistent with minor changes insecondary structure, mutation of ARE3 and ARE4 to luciferase reporter geneassay did not abolish the effect of p38α. This indicates that thesecondary structure of wild-type 3′-UTR is necessary for the p38αtargeting. TNFα remains the best demonstrated cytokine regulated by thep38α MAPK pathway at post-transcriptional level. The tight control ofTNFα expression is achieved by regulating mRNA stability, translationalinitiation, and polyadenylation. During this process, trans-actingfactors that bind to TNFα 3′-UTR, including AREs are essential. Incontrast, limited information is available regarding the nature of IL-6 mRNAstability and regulation by MAPK p38α. Using a p38α-deficient cellline, strict criteria regarding signaling intermediate requirements for IL-6expression and mRNA stability could be applied. According to previousp38α inhibitor experiments, we predicted that IL-6 expression wasdown-regulated in p38α–/– MEFs atpost-transcriptional level. Consistent with our expectation, IL-6 mRNA decayincreased in p38α–/– MEFs compared withp38α+/+ cells. In the present study, MEF cells treated with IL-1 resulted inphosphorylation of p38α to produce IL-6. Fibroblast IL-6 production wasinhibited by SB203580 (26Miyazawa K. Mori A. Miyata H. Akahane M. Ajisawa Y. Okudaira H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24832-24838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Todetermine p38α is critical for the IL-1-induced IL-6 production by usingp38α–/– cells, the normal expression of IL-1receptor in p38α–/– cells is required. It hasbeen reported that p38α–/– ES cells also gaverise to a population of IL-1R-positive cells after the in vitrodifferentiation process (32Allen M. Svensson L. Roach M. Hambor J. McNeish J. Gabel C.A. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 859-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar).The percentage of cells that express IL-1R was comparable inp38α+/+ and p38α–/– cultures.Our data show that reconstitution of p38α cDNA inp38α–/– cells restored the IL-1β-inducedIL-6 production consistent with that the decrease of IL-6 production is due tothe p38α deficiency rather than the defect of IL-1R. p38α iscritical but not essential for the IL-6 production. Therefore, failure toincrease IL-6 production by overexpression p38α in wide-type cells wasnot unexpected. It is possible that other proteins are limiting theinvolvement of p38α. For example, MAPK/extracellular signal-regulatedkinase kinase kinase 3 (MEKK3), which is the potent activator of MAPKs, isessential for the IL-1-induced IL-6 production(33Huang Q. Yang J. Lin Y. Walker C. Cheng J. Liu Z.G. Su B. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). However, it was somewhatsurprising that p38AF decreased the IL-6 production in bothp38α+/+ and p38α–/– cells. Fourmembers of the p38 MAPK family have been cloned: p38α,-β,-γ,and -δ (34Ono K. Han J. CellSignal. 2000; 12: 1-13Google Scholar,35Zarubin T. Han J. CellRes. 2005; 15: 11-18Google Scholar). p38β shares ∼74%sequence identity with p38α and contains the TGY dual phosphorylationmotif observed in p38α(36Wang X.S. Diener K. Manthey C.L. Wang S. Rosenzweig B. Bray J. Delaney J. Cole C.N. Chan-Hui P.Y. Mantlo N. Lichenstein H.S. Zukowski M. Yao Z. J. Biol.Chem. 1997; 272: 23668-23674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). p38β is activatedby IL-1 stimulation, but 4-folder lower than p38α(37Jiang Y. Chen C. Li Z. Guo W. Gegner J.A. Lin S. Han J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17920-17926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). In addition, MK2 is thesubstrate of both p38α and p38β(37Jiang Y. Chen C. Li Z. Guo W. Gegner J.A. Lin S. Han J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17920-17926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Therefore, we predictthat p38AF decreased the activation of MK2 by the co-repression ofp38β. In our present study, no significant effects of p38α deficiency onIL-6 proximal promoter reporter activity were demonstrated (data not shown).This result is consistent with previous reports from our group, where p38inhibitors had minimal effects on IL-6 proximal promoter in MC3T3-E1osteoblastic-like cells (38Patil C. Zhu X. Rossa Jr., C. Kim Y.J. Kirkwood K.L. Immunol. Invest. 2004; 33: 213-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).Others have reported that SB203580 did not effect the activation of the IL-6promoter by IL-1β in human fibroblast-like synoviocytes(26Miyazawa K. Mori A. Miyata H. Akahane M. Ajisawa Y. Okudaira H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24832-24838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Collectively, theseresults indicate that the effect of p38α deficiency on IL-6 geneexpression results from the down-regulation of post-transcriptional level,however, we cannot rule out any role of transcriptional activation in thesepresent studies. SB203580 significantly reduced the mRNA stability of endogenous IL-6. Theresults were also confirmed in vivo by comparing half-life of IL-6mRNA between p38α+/+ and p38α–/–MEFs. To analyze the regulation of IL-6 mRNA stability, the luciferasereporter gene system was employed. We found that p38α stabilized themRNA reporter construct carrying the IL-6 3′-UTR. All these datasupported the conclusion that p38α signaling increases IL-6 mRNAstability via 3′-UTR. The degradation of endogenous IL-6 mRNA and mRNAreporter construct containing the IL-6 3′-UTR is only marginallyaffected in p38α+/+ MEFs. This is probably due to the lessclassic ARE and perhaps weaker IL-6 ARE elements of the IL-6 3′-UTRcompared with TNFα and other cytokines. TNFα, granulocytemacrophage-colony stimulating factor, and IL-3 AREs are typical class II AREswith a core AUUUA motif cluster, which mediated rapid mRNA decay(30Stoecklin G. Stoeckle P. Lu M. Muehlemann O. Moroni C. Rna. 2001; 7: 1578-1588PubMed Google Scholar). The AREs ofc-myc and c-fos are prototypes of class I, containing one tothree scattered copies of the AUUUA motif, whereas other cytokine transcripts,including IL-2, IL-4, and IL-6 contain class I-like AREs that arenon-clustered (30Stoecklin G. Stoeckle P. Lu M. Muehlemann O. Moroni C. Rna. 2001; 7: 1578-1588PubMed Google Scholar). Thesenon-clustered motifs are considered weaker AREs. The differences in cellstypes and stimulus may also account for this minimal degradation. In thepresent study, we observed only modest changes with IL-6 ARE reporter activityfollowing stimulation with IL-1β (data not shown). These data areconsistent with the concept that the IL-6 ARE is weaker compared with otherAREs or alternatively there are differences in the MEF cells lines used inthese studies. A paradigm that has been helpful in understanding the regulation ofpost-transcriptional control was that RNA-binding protein binds to specificcis-acting elements in target transcript and activate3′-to-5′-exonucleolytic decay or/and influence the translationalcontrol. Some RNA-binding proteins, like tristetraprolin, AU-binding factor 1,and K homology splicing-regulatory protein, promote mRNA decay, whereasothers, like members of the Hu family, prevent mRNA degradation(15Antic D. Keene J.D. Am. J.Hum. Genet. 1997; 61: 273-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 16Brennan C.M. Steitz J.A. Cell Mol.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1023-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Deletion or mutation ofAUUUA motifs could alter the components of mRNA-trans factor complexand affect the luciferase activity of reporter gene containing the IL-63′-UTR with mutated AUUUA motifs. Using this approach, we identifiedARE1, ARE2, and ARE5 as the cis-elements regulated by p38α inIL-6-3′-UTR. Interestingly, mutation of ARE1 and ARE2 resulted in theenhanced expression due to the deficiency of p38α, whereas mutation ofARE5 decreased the luciferase expression in the presence of p38α. Thesedata are consistent with the idea that p38α is required for the ARE1 andARE2 to repress expression and for ARE5 to enhance expression. Our data indicated that distinct cis-elements of 3′-UTRexert opposing influence on the post-transcriptional fate of IL-6 mRNA. Asimilar bi-functional role for the 3′-UTR has been described for othermRNAs, including RNase-L (39Li X.L. Andersen J.B. Ezelle H.J. Wilson G.M. Hassel B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 7950-7960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).In that study, eight AREs were identified in the RNase-L 3′-UTR, anddeletion analysis identified AREs 7 and 8 served as a strong positiveregulatory function, whereas AREs 2 and 4 are critical for the negativeregulatory function. Also, HuR and AU-binding factor 1 were found to bind top21 and cyclin D1 mRNAs in the nucleus, and independently operate oppositefunction in the cytoplasm depending on the physiological context(40Lal A. Mazan-Mamczarz K. Kawai T. Yang X. Martindale J.L. Gorospe M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3092-3102Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). RNA-binding proteins recognize RNA targets in a sequence-specific manner,and the secondary structure context of the binding site also affects thebinding affinity (31Hiller M. Pudimat R. Busch A. Backofen R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: e117Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Bindingsites are often located in single-stranded RNA regions. For example, HuRprotein influences mRNA stability by binding to the motif NNTTNNTTT where HuRaffinity correlates with the single-strandedness of this binding motif(41Meisner N.C. Hackermuller J. Uhl V. Aszodi A. Jaritz M. Auer M. Chembiochem. 2004; 5: 1432-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar,42Hackermuller J. Meisner N.C. Auer M. Jaritz M. Stadler P.F. Gene. 2005; 345: 3-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). IL-63′-UTR-(56–173) displays a typical “stem-loop” orhairpin structure. This structure might be critical for IL-63′-UTR-(56–173) inducing rapid mRNA decay. Recently studies have shown that microRNA targeting of ARE appeared to bean essential step in ARE-mediated mRNA degradation(43Jing Q. Huang S. Guth S. Zarubin T. Motoyama A. Chen J. Di Padova F. Lin S.C. Gram H. Han J. Cell. 2005; 120: 623-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). The ability of microRNAto target mRNA is directed by the paring of microRNA to mRNA. It is anintriguing possibility that microRNA is implicated for p38α to regulatethe repressive elements in IL-6 3′-UTR. Cell signaling through p38α MAPK is necessary forpost-transcriptional regulation of many pro-inflammatory cytokines. In thisstudy, the cis-acting elements of IL-6 3′-UTR mRNA thatrequired p38α signaling for mRNA stability and translation wereidentified. AUUUA motif mutation analysis using gene reporter systemsperformed in p38α+/+ and p38α–/–MEF cells revealed that ARE1, ARE2, and ARE5 in IL-6 3′-UTR weretargeted by p38α, and IL-6 3′-UTR-(56–173) is critical forp38 to promote mRNA stability. The predicted RNA secondary structure of theseARE reporter mutants was consistent with the ability to alter reporterexpression data, suggesting that the molecular targets of p38 MAPK thatinteract with ARE mutants are dependent upon IL-6 3′-UTR secondarystructure."

Multidrug drug resistance, in particular bacterial resistance to clinical antibiotics, is a widely known phenomenon. Basic defense mechanisms of bacteria include permeability barriers, inactivation of antimicrobials, modification of antibiotic targets, and active drug efflux (1Poole K. J. Appl. Microbiol. Symp. Suppl. 2002; : 55S-64SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). Active efflux is conducted by primary and secondary active transport proteins and the latter are found in almost all transporter families (2Van Bambeke F. Balzi E. Tulkens P.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 60: 457-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism of the broad substrate specificity of multidrug efflux pumps is not yet fully understood. To this end structural studies are desirable, but currently only 13 three-dimensional structures of different transport proteins are known and not every transport family is represented. The only multidrug transporter with known three-dimensional structure is AcrB (4Murakami S. Nakashima R. Yamashita E. Matsumoto T. Yamaguchi A.

It has been shown that Glu14 is an essential residue and directly involved in drug and proton binding (28Soskine M. Adam Y. Schuldiner S. J. Biol.

Whether EmrE forms a symmetric or an asymmetric dimer should be reflected in the chemical shifts of residues such as Glu14, which are likely to be found at the dimerization interface. We therefore 13C-labeled Glu14 in EmrE by utilizing a cell-free expression system. To allow an unambiguous NMR analysis, the nonessential residue Glu25 was replaced with alanine (EmrE E25A) to create a single glutamate mutant. The protein was reconstituted into E. coli lipids allowing the most native environment possible. The sample was maintained at pH 8.0. Under these conditions, without a pH gradient, EmrE, like other secondary transporters (33van Iwaarden P.R. Driessen A.J. Lolkema J.S. Kaback H.R. Konings W.N. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5419-5424Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), is able to bind substrate and can undergo equilibrium substrate exchange reactions (20Muth T.R. Schuldiner S.

Non-invasive solid state NMR revealed significantly different chemical shifts between both Glu14 residues that change upon substrate binding.

Wild type EmrE in a pET21a+ vector was kindly provided by F. Bernhard, J. W. Goethe University, Frankfurt. For this study we constructed the mutant EmrE E25A with His6 tag in a pET21a+ vector. EmrE was amplified from the pET21a+ vector using a forward primer with a NdeI restriction site (cggcatatgaacccttatatttatcttggtggtgc) and a reverse primer with a HindIII restriction site (cggaagcttttagtggtggtggtggtggtgatgtggtgtgcttcgtga). The amplified fragment and the vector pET21a+ were digested with endonucleases NdeI and HindIII, the vector was dephosphorylated using antarctic phosphatase and the fragments ligated into the vector using T4 DNA ligase. The mutation E25A was introduced using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis methodology with the mutagenic primer (cataaccgtgtaaaacctgctgaaaacttcattaag). In Vitro and in Vivo ExpressionCoupled cell free transcription/translation, as previously described (34Klammt C. Lohr F. Schafer B. Haase W. Dotsch V. Ruterjans H. Glaubitz C. Bernhard F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 568-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), was used for the expression of EmrE E25A as precipitate. Expression of soluble EmrE E25A was achieved using 0.1% (w/v) DDM in the reaction mixture (35Klammt C. Schwarz D. Fendler K. Haase W. Dotsch V. Bernhard F. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 6024-6038Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). [U-13C,15N]Glutamate was used to produce selectively glutamate-labeled EmrE E25A. The bacterial strain used for in vivo expression was E. coli TA15 (36Goldberg E.B. Arbel T. Chen J. Karpel R. Mackie G.A. Schuldiner S. Padan E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2615-2619Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). It was additionally transformed with the pGP1-2 plasmid encoding the T7 polymerase under a heat shock promoter λPL (37Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2459) Google Scholar). Expression was performed as previously described (25Basting D. Lorch M. Lehner I. Glaubitz C. FASEB J. 2007; 10.1096/fj.07-9162comPubMed Google Scholar). Protein PurificationIn vivo produced EmrE was purified by cell disruption and membrane preparation as previously described (25Basting D. Lorch M. Lehner I. Glaubitz C. FASEB J. 2007; 10.1096/fj.07-9162comPubMed Google Scholar). In vitro (soluble and precipitate) and in vivo produced EmrE was diluted into 25 ml of solubilizing buffer (100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm imidazole, 1 pill Roche mini complete protease inhibitor, and 1% (w/v) DDM) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After removal of the unsolubilized components by centrifugation (184,000 × g for 50 min), the supernatant was mixed with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin for 80 min at 4 °C in a beaker. The resin was washed with wash buffer (100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 30 mm imidazole, and 0.1% (w/v) DDM) until A280 was below 0.05. The protein was eluted with the same buffer containing 300 mm imidazole and the approximate protein concentration was determined at 280 nm using the elution buffer as a blank. Protein ReconstitutionEmrE was reconstituted at a protein/lipid mole ratio of 1:100 for solid state NMR in buffer (100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) and at 1:450 mole ratio for fluorescence spectroscopy in buffer (150 mm KCl, 5 mm K+-EDTA, pH 7.3) using the following method. 4 mg/ml E. coli total lipid extract was solubilized with a 1:2 mole ratio of DDM for 1 h at room temperature with sonication. Protein and lipid/detergent solutions were mixed at the required ratio and incubated for 1 h at room temperature, followed by detergent removal using pre-washed and sonicated Bio-Beads SM-2. In total 3× 30 mg of Bio-Beads/mg of detergent were added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature and once at 4 °C overnight. Bio-Beads were removed and the liposomes pelleted by centrifugation. Incubation with 3 μm EtBr was performed for 30 min at room temperature in the buffer (100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). The EtBr concentration was chosen to theoretically provide greater than 99% occupancy at the binding site. For the fluorescence transport assay bR at a 1:280 protein:lipid mole ratio was added to the mixture and freeze/thawed, which results in an ∼90% inside out orientation of bR in the vesicles (38Perozo E. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10471-10478Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Fluorescence-based Transport AssaysTransport assays were carried out exactly as described previously (25Basting D. Lorch M. Lehner I. Glaubitz C. FASEB J. 2007; 10.1096/fj.07-9162comPubMed Google Scholar). MALDI-TOF Mass SpectrometryPurified EmrE, ∼0.64 mg/ml, was used (20 mm NaCl, 15 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1–0.2% (w/v) DDM). Matrix DHBs was prepared using acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (1:2, v/v) as solvent. Additionally, a protein calibration mixture was added to the matrix solution as an internal standard. 1 μl of matrix solution was mixed with 1 μl of diluted EmrE (in a ratio of 1:10 with water) and dried. The protein mass determination was performed with a Voyager DE-PRO (Applied Biosystems, MDS Sciex). Spectra were recorded in the linear mode (25 kV acceleration voltage, 93% grid voltage, 350 ns delay time). Spectra were smoothed, noise-filtered, labeled, and internally calibrated (two-point calibration) using Data Explorer version 4.9 software (Applied Biosystems, MDS Sciex). Freeze FracturingProteoliposomes in sample holders were frozen in ethane cooled to -180 °C by liquid nitrogen. Fracturing at -120 °C and replication at a shadowing angle of 45° with platinum/carbon was performed with a BAF 060 freeze-fracturing unit from Bal-Tec Inc. (Principality of Lichtenstein). NMR SpectroscopyXWIN-NMR and Topspin 2.0 from Bruker (Karlsruhe, Germany) and Sparky 3 (T. D. Goddard and D. G. Kneller, University of California) were used for data acquisition and processing. Solid State NMR Spectroscopy13C spectra at 150.90 and 100.62 MHz were recorded on 600 and 400 MHz Bruker Avance spectrometers, respectively, using 4 mm MAS DVT probeheads. Reconstituted samples containing ∼1 mg of EmrE were transferred to a 4-mm Bruker style zirconia rotor (RototecSpintec, Germany), sealed by high resolution MAS inserts, and quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Sample measurements were performed at 200 K with MAS spinning rate of 10,000 ± 5 Hz. DQSQ correlation spectra of the INADE-QUATE type (39Lesage A. Auger C. Caldarelli S. Emsley L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 7867-7868Crossref Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 40Lesage A. Bardet M. Emsley L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 10987-10993Crossref Scopus (373) Google Scholar) were collected by using the SR22 pulse sequence previously described (41Carravetta M. Eden M. Johannessen O.G. Luthman H. Verdegem P.J.E. Lugtenburg J. Sebald A. Levitt M.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 10628-10638Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). One-dimensional DQF spectra were also collected with the SR22 pulse sequence and similar settings. A relaxation delay of 1.5 s and 4 dummy scans were used. Cross-polarization contact time was 500 μs, 1H 90° pulse was 3 μs, 13C 90° pulse was 3.4 μs, and 400 μs DQ excitation and reconversion time was used. Time proportional phase incrementation acquisition was used for two-dimensional spectra (42Drobny G. Pines A. Sinton S. Weitekamp D. Wemmer D. Symp. Faraday Soc. 1979; 13: 49Crossref Google Scholar). 1H decoupling during the DQ excitation and reconversion was achieved using continuous wave irradiation at ∼100 kHz and during t1 and t2 evolution composite decoupling using SPINAL 64 (43Fung B.M. Khitrin A.K. Ermolaev K. J. Magn. Reson. 2000; 142: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1560) Google Scholar) at 83.3 kHz was used. Experiments were recorded with 45,000 Hz sweepwidth in the direct dimension and 90,000 Hz in the indirect dimension. Exponential 150 Hz line broadening was used in both dimensions. The spectra were recorded with 128 or 96 increments in the indirect dimension and 2720 points in the direct dimension. Scan numbers varied between experiments and are indicated in the figure legends. 1H and 13C were referenced to 0 ppm with tetramethylsilane at 4 °C and ∼2,000 Hz spinning. For chemical shift anisotropy line shape fitting in Topspin 2.0 the Solids Lineshape Analysis tool was used with mixed Gaussian/Lorentzian line shapes. Sample PreparationTo investigate the electronic structure of Glu14 in EmrE, a selectively labeled sample was required. For this, in vitro transcription and translation has to be employed as selective glutamate labeling in vivo is difficult due to isotope scrambling (44Sachs R.K. Halverson K.M. Barry B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44222-44229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In addition, a single glutamate mutation is necessary to avoid spectral overlap and to obtain unambiguous data. Cell-free protein expression has been carried out both as precipitate followed by solubilization in DDM and also directly in the presence of DDM. The resultant 13C-Glu14 EmrE E25A was reconstituted into native E. coli lipids. Sample purity, labeling efficiency, activity, and sample homogeneity were carefully examined. Protein purity was analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and SDS-PAGE. A typical spectrum is shown in Fig. 1. The peak at 12,754.98 ± 2.33 Da agrees very well with the mass expected for [13C]glutamate-labeled EmrE E25A (12752.1 Da). The absence of other signals and the result of SDS-PAGE show, that EmrE E25A was pure. Mass spectrometry, in addition to SDS-PAGE, is a very sensitive tool to assess contamination with soluble proteins. Membrane proteins other than EmrE do not occur in our cell-free expression system. We have verified that no [13C]glutamate scrambling in the in vitro expression system takes place by performing a complete translation and transcription experiment without DNA template. A 13C NMR analysis of the whole reaction mixture did not show any signs of glutamate to glutamine conversion (see supplemental Fig. S1). Purified protein solubilized in DDM was directly reconstituted into E. coli total lipids at a 1:100 mol ratio. We selected E. coli lipids to ensure a native membrane environment. Reconstitution was consistently successful, as monitored by freeze fracture microscopy. Even after many days of NMR experiments, samples were very homogeneous without any aggregates as shown in Fig. 2. We verified the activity of cell free-produced EmrE E25A and wild type EmrE prepared in vivo with a previously described ethidium bromide transport assay (25Basting D. Lorch M. Lehner I. Glaubitz C. FASEB J. 2007; 10.1096/fj.07-9162comPubMed Google Scholar). In the course of the assay, bR driven H+ pumping and EtBr fluorescence is initiated by light excitation at 545 nm. EmrE then uses the generated pH gradient as energy source for an antiport of EtBr. The transport can be detected by an increase of EtBr total fluorescence intensity due to binding to a transport cycle intermediate (25Basting D. Lorch M. Lehner I. Glaubitz C. FASEB J. 2007; 10.1096/fj.07-9162comPubMed Google Scholar). The time traces in Fig. 3 show an increase of total fluorescence for EmrE produced in vivo and EmrE E25A produced cell free both as precipitate and in the presence of detergent. Traces are almost identical and transport activity ceases when adding carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone, which uncouples both ΔpH and ΔΨ (45Grinius L.L. Goldberg E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29998-30004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), nigericin, which uncouples ΔpH (21Rotem D. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48787-48793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), or TPP+ a competitive non-fluorescent substrate (20Muth T.R. Schuldiner S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 234-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). These data verified that active protein was produced using in vitro translation/transcription and that both expression modes, as precipitate or in the presence of detergent, are possible. As a consequence of these results, all NMR experiments described below were carried out on EmrE E25A expressed as precipitate due to the significantly higher yields. One-dimensional NMRDQF 13C MAS NMR spectra of [13C]glutamate-labeled EmrE E25A in E. coli lipids are shown in Fig. 4. Filtering was necessary to remove the 13C natural abundance contributions (1.1%), from lipids and unlabeled residues, which overlap with the resonances of Glu14. The spectrum shown in Fig. 4a reveals a symmetric Cα doublet (labeled Glu I and Glu II), which becomes asymmetric upon addition of EtBr (see Fig. 4b). The Cα splitting was reproducible as verified with two independent sample preparations (see supplemental Fig. S2). The spectral contributions of natural abundance spin pairs (0.01%), which will not be suppressed by double quantum filtering, was assessed by acquiring a 13C DQF spectrum of E. coli lipids alone (Fig. 4c). Despite the very low abundance of naturally occurring spin pairs, a CH2 signal can clearly be seen. This observation is not surprising considering that 100 lipids with ∼28 methylene groups contribute ∼30% of the magnetization to the EmrE E25A glutamate side chain signal. Two-dimensional DQSQ SpectraTo unambiguously assign C′, Cα, Cβ, Cγ, and Cδ resonances, and to check whether all resonances are doubled, two-dimensional 13C DQSQ experiments were carried out. These correlation spectra contain chemical shift information for all nuclei in the direct dimension and depict bond connectivities in the indirect dimension (46Zhang F.L. Trbovic N. Wang J.B. Bruschweiler R. J. Magn. Reson. 2005; 174: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional spectra without substrate (Fig. 5a) and with EtBr (Fig. 5b) indicate at first inspection multiple peaks, with distinct chemical shifts, for each nucleus. INADEQUATE type assignment walks starting from both major Cα peaks shown in Fig. 5, a and b, confirm peak doublets for all Glu14 carbons. An unambiguous assignment in this type of spectra is aided by the fact that the sum of two peak frequencies in the direct dimension is equal to their frequencies in the indirect dimension. As already indicated in Fig. 4, we refer to the set of resonances connected to the less shielded Cα as Glu I (blue lines in Fig. 5) and the other as Glu II (red lines in Fig. 5). Chemical shifts for both Glu I and Glu II with and without EtBr are summarized in Table 1.TABLE 113C chemical shifts of Glu14 in EmrE E25A with and without EtBrC′CαCβCγCδ13C chemical shifts of Glu14 of EmrE E25A (ppm)Glu I177.356.827.833.5180.1Glu II172.453.125.430.9177.213C chemical shifts of Glu14 of EmrE E25A with EtBr (ppm)Glu I174.658.727.332.6178.9Glu II170.952.923.528.1176.3 Open table in a new tab Line Shape AnalysisMultiple distinct molecular environments are suggested by the need for at least two distinct sets of chemical shifts to describe the 13C spectra of Glu14. To obtain a more quantitative picture, a line shape analysis was carried out for the Cα peaks that showed the most pronounced splitting. The symmetric Cα doublet of EmrE E25A can be adequately described by two resonances of similar integral intensity with respective line widths of 3.0 (Glu I) and 4.0 ppm (Glu II) (Fig. 4d). The different chemical shifts of these two resonances are indicative of two inequivalent EmrE E25A populations. The line width indicates a limited amount of heterogeneity. In contrast, four peaks are required to describe the asymmetric Cα line shape that is observed in the presence of EtBr (Fig. 4e). The two main peaks, Glu I and Glu II, are of equal integral intensity. The two additional peaks contribute 28% magnetization to the spectrum. The addition of EtBr therefore causes Glu14 to be present in more than two distinct molecular environments. The line width of both main peaks is reduced to 1.8 (Glu I) and 2.8 ppm (Glu II) compared with EmrE E25A without substrate, suggesting a decrease in structural heterogeneity concomitant with an increase of populations. In this study we set out to probe the proposed active site structure of the functional homodimeric EmrE with and without the substrate EtBr. For this investigation the single glutamate mutant EmrE E25A was selectively isotope labeled at the remaining conserved Glu14. This enabled unambiguous chemical shift assignment and simplified data interpretation. The capability of E. coli-based cell-free transcription and translation systems to express wild type EmrE in a functional form with and without detergent was previously shown (17Elbaz Y.

https://openalex.org/W2008356974,"Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is a model organism for the functional genomics of monocotyledonous plants since the genome size is considerably smaller than those of other monocotyledonous plants. Although highly accurate genome sequences of indica and japonica rice are available, additional resources such as full-length complementary DNA (FL-cDNA) sequences are also indispensable for comprehensive analyses of gene structure and function. We cross-referenced 28.5K individual loci in the rice genome defined by mapping of 578K FL-cDNA clones with the 56K loci predicted in the TIGR genome assembly. Based on the annotation status and the presence of corresponding cDNA clones, genes were classified into 23K annotated expressed (AE) genes, 33K annotated non-expressed (ANE) genes, and 5.5K non-annotated expressed (NAE) genes. We developed a 60mer oligo-array for analysis of gene expression from each locus. Analysis of gene structures and expression levels revealed that the general features of gene structure and expression of NAE and ANE genes were considerably different from those of AE genes. The results also suggested that the cloning efficiency of rice FL-cDNA is associated with the transcription activity of the corresponding genetic locus, although other factors may also have an effect. Comparison of the coverage of FL-cDNA among gene families suggested that FL-cDNA from genes encoding rice- or eukaryote-specific domains, and those involved in regulatory functions were difficult to produce in bacterial cells. Collectively, these results indicate that rice genes can be divided into distinct groups based on transcription activity and gene structure, and that the coverage bias of FL-cDNA clones exists due to the incompatibility of certain eukaryotic genes in bacteria."

Two phosphoinositides, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate, are important for the ATP-dependent priming of the secretory apparatus prior to Ca2+-dependent exocytosis. Mechanisms that control phosphoinositide levels are likely to play an important role in priming fine tuning.

We recently demonstrated an involvement of the type II PI3K, PI3K-C2α, and its product PtdIns(3)P in priming, an ATP-dependent step during which LDCV acquire the ability to fuse with the plasma membrane (12Meunier F.A.

This novel role played by PtdIns(3)P in promoting the priming stage of exocytosis has opened a number of new research avenues regarding the mechanism(s) regulating the concentration of PtdIns(3)P and the potential role played by other 3-phosphorylated phosphoinositides in neurosecretory cells. Priming is a reversible step and must be tightly controlled to prevent too many vesicles from reaching the primed state. PtdIns(3)P levels could be negatively regulated in either or both of two ways: through dephosphorylation of PtdIns(3)P by members of the myotubularin family of enzymes (18Clague M.J. Lorenzo O.

Similarly, in mammalian cells, suppression of PIKfyve activity, either by overexpressing a kinase-inactive mutant or by siRNA-mediated knockdown results in the accumulation of enlarged internal membrane structures of endocytic origin (22Ikonomov O.C. Sbrissa D. Shisheva A. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 291: C393-C404Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 23Rutherford A.C. Traer C. Wassmer T. Pattni K. Bujny M.V. Carlton J.G. Stenmark H. Cullen P.J. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 3944-3957Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). PIKfyve was shown to be localized on early (24Cabezas A. Pattni K. Stenmark H. Gene (Amst.). 2006; 371: 34-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and late endosomes (22Ikonomov O.C. Sbrissa D. Shisheva A. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 291: C393-C404Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Evidence from an in vitro endosome fusion assay suggested that PIKfyve may act as a negative regulator of endosome fusion (22Ikonomov O.C. Sbrissa D. Shisheva A. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 291: C393-C404Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), whereas siRNA studies were consistent with PIKfyve regulating endosome-TGN trafficking (23Rutherford A.C. Traer C. Wassmer T. Pattni K. Bujny M.V. Carlton J.G. Stenmark H. Cullen P.J. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 3944-3957Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Notably, PIKfyve has also been shown to regulate trafficking of IRAP/GLUT4 vesicles to the plasma membrane in adipocytes (25Berwick D.C. Dell G.C. Welsh G.I. Heesom K.J. Hers I. Fletcher L.M. Cooke F.T. Tavare J.M. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5985-5993Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This suggests that PIKfyve could play a pleiotropic role in membrane trafficking, including on the exocytic pathway. In this study, we have investigated the expression of PIKfyve in neurosecretory cells and found that it partially localizes to LDCV in an activity-dependent manner. We have used a combination of pharmacological, overexpression, and siRNA approaches to demonstrate that PIKfyve kinase activity plays a critical role in controlling regulated exocytosis in neurosecretory cells. Antibodies—PIKfyve antiserum was raised by inoculating a rabbit with a synthetic peptide corresponding to the last 18 amino acids of mouse PIKfyve (NP_035216). The specificity and selectivity of this antibody for PIKfyve was confirmed by Western blotting extracts of HEK293 cells transiently transfected with pEGFP-C1 or PIKfyve-EGFP, Western blotting and peptide competition and immunocytochemistry on PC12 cells transiently transfected with pEGFP-C1 or PIKfyve-EGFP (Fig. S1). This characterization demonstrated that the anti-PIKfyve antibody is specific for and can detect human (HEK293 cells), rat (PC12), and mouse (overexpressed) PIKfyve by both Western blotting and immunocytochemistry. Other antibodies used were anti-EEA1 (early endosomal antigen 1) (BD Transduction Laboratories), anti-Syt1 (M48) (26Matthew W.D. Tsavaler L. Reichardt L.F. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 91: 257-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), anti-P18 (27Dittie A.S. Tooze S.A. Biochem.

Gel Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—Tissue extracts were prepared by homogenizing tissues at 4 °C in homogenization buffer (20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.32 m sucrose) containing 1 mm dithiothreitol and Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) with a Dounce homogenizer. Cellular debris and nuclei were removed by low speed centrifugation, and protein concentrations of the postnuclear supernatants were determined by Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad) using a standard curve of purified IgG. Subcellular fractionation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes (kind gift of R. Parton, Institute for Molecular Bioscience, Queensland, Australia) and PC12 and chromaffin cells was carried out by scraping cells in homogenization buffer as above. Samples were homogenized by repeated passage through a 25-gauge needle, and cellular debris and nuclei were removed by low speed centrifugation. Membrane and cytosolic fractions were separated by centrifugation at 125,000 × gav for 45 min, and protein concentrations were determined as above. 50μg of protein/fraction was resuspended in SDS sample buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol, heated for 3 min at 95 °C, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (0.2 μm; Bio-Rad), blocked in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 5% nonfat milk (w/v), probed overnight at 4 °C with the indicated primary antibodies, and detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:5000; Pierce) for 1 h followed by enhanced chemiluminescence (SuperSignal; Pierce). Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from rat subcutaneous adipose tissue, adrenal glands, and rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells (ATCC) using the SV total RNA isolation system (Promega). Poly(A) RNA was reverse transcribed using oligo(dT)18 primers and used as a template for PCR primers designed on the basis of the data base sequence of rat PIKfyve XM_237217: forward (residues 910–931) and reverse (residues 1209–1229). β-Actin primers were chosen as a positive control. Catecholamine Secretion from Adrenal Chromaffin Cells—Chromaffin cells were prepared from bovine adrenal glands and maintained in 24- or 96-well plates (Nunc) as previously described (31Jefferies H. Cooke F. Jat P. Koizumi T. Hayakawa M. Kaizawa H. Ohishi T. Workman P. Waterfield M. Parker P. EMBO Rep. 2007; doi:10.1038/sj.embor.7401155Google Scholar). Intact cells were washed briefly once with buffer A: 145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.2 mm Na2HPO4; 10 mm glucose; 20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.4), preincubated with the indicated concentrations of inhibitors or inactive analogues for 20 min, and further stimulated for 20 min using high K+ modified buffer A: KCl, increased to 60 mm and NaCl decreased to 90 mm in the presence of 2 mm CaCl2. Aliquots of the supernatant were taken at the end of each experiment, and cells were lysed with 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 (Sigma). Both sets of samples were assayed fluorometrically for catecholamines, and the amount released was expressed as a percentage of the total catecholamine content of the cells (12Meunier F.A.

PIKfyve siRNA—For siRNA targeting, rat PIKfyve cDNA fragments TGACTTGCCTCACTCTCCT, encoding the 19-nucleotide siRNA sequence derived from the target transcript and separated from its reverse 19-nucleotide complement by a short spacer, were annealed and cloned in the BglII and HindIII sites in front of the H1 promoter of a modified pXGH5 plasmid encoding for growth hormone named pGH-super as described previously (30Vitale N.

The human sequence TGATTTGCCTCGATCTCCT was used as control (differences from rat sequence are underlined). Transfection efficiency has been estimated by counting growth hormone-positive cells from 400–500 cells as described previously (30Vitale N. Mawet J. Camonis J. Regazzi R. Bader M.F.

Transfection efficiency was between 30 and 50%, and more than 95% of transfected cells co-expressed hGH and the protein of interest. 48 h after transfection, PC12 cells were briefly washed in buffer A and either stimulated in high K+ buffer for 20 min or pretreated for 20 min with either inhibitor or inactive analogue prior to stimulation. Aliquots of the supernatant were collected, and the cells detached using the remaining buffer passing through a 25-gauge needle several times. The amount of secretion from co-transfected cells was determined as percentage of total hGH/well using an hGH radioimmunoassay kit (Nichols Institute) (12Meunier F.A. Osborne S.L. Hammond G.R. Cooke F.T. Parker P.J. Domin J. Schiavo G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 4841-4851Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Plotted data are representative of experiments carried out in triplicate and performed at least four times. Immunocytochemistry and Live Cell Imaging—Cells seeded on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min, washed in PBS, and then blocked for 1 h in PBS containing 3% normal horse serum, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Triton X-100. For treatments, cells were incubated for 20 min in Buffer A at 37 °C, 5% CO2 with the indicated concentrations of YM-201636 or YM-211387 prior to fixation. A similar experiment was carried out using nicotine stimulation prior to fixation in Buffer A containing 2 mm Ca2+. Coverslips were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies and/or rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes), washed with PBS, and revealed using relevant secondary conjugated antibodies (Alexa488 and Alexa546; 1:500; Molecular Probes) for 30 min at room temperature in the dark, followed by extensive washing and mounting with Prolong Gold (Molecular Probes). In other experiments, chromaffin cells (2–3 days of culturing) were permeabilized with digitonin (Sigma) (20 μm) in potassium glutamate buffer (KGEP): 139 mm potassium glutamate, 5 mm glucose, 5 mm EGTA, 20 mm PIPES-NaOH, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP in the continuing presence of boiled or unboiled ENTH-GST (6 μg/ml) for 10 min. Cells were washed in KGEP buffer, fixed, and processed for immunocytochemistry as described above and in the figure legends. Samples were imaged with a laser-scanning microscope (LSM 510; Zeiss). To illustrate the degree of colocalization, scatter diagrams were produced using LSM 510 software plotting the pixel intensity in the red and green channels (x and y coordinates, respectively). Double-stained pixel (intensity > 100–150 arbitrary units) of the optical sections were highlighted in white. Quantification of the degree of co-localization was performed using the color range tool of LSM 510 software or Laserpix software (Bio-Rad). Briefly, immunopositive puncta were selected first in the green channel as regions of interest. 30–110 regions of interest were selected per cell for at least eight cells. Regions of interest with intensity > 100–150 arbitrary units in both the green and red channels were considered co-localized. The percentage of co-localizing ROI was calculated per image, and the mean and S.E. were calculated. This process was repeated in the red channel. Quantification of the area and size of the early endosomes was carried out by image analysis on EEA1 staining using Laserpix software (Bio-Rad). Briefly, clearly identifiable EEA1-positive structures were outlined, and area and size (length and width) measurement data were acquired using the software. Time Lapse Confocal Microscopy Imaging—Confocal microscope (LSM 510 Meta; Zeiss) laser power was set at <4% for a 488-nm argon laser, and a ×63 water immersion objective (numerical aperture = 0.93) was used. The pinhole was chosen to give rise to confocal z sections less than 2.5 μm. The frequency of acquisition was 2 frames/min over the 10–15-min incubation period. Cells were bathed in Buffer A containing 2 mm Ca2+, and nicotine (100 μm) was applied by injection using a Hamilton syringe. Analysis of Time Lapse Confocal Images—Labeled organelles that remained in the same optical section throughout the duration of imaging were selected for intensity analysis. The changes in intensity of PIKfyve staining in the cytosol and on identified organelles were followed over time before and after nicotine treatment. The values were expressed as percentage increase of the normalized initial fluorescence intensity of PIKfyve. PIKfyve Inhibitor—YM-201636 was identified as an inhibitor of PIKfyve by serendipity (31Jefferies H. Cooke F. Jat P. Koizumi T. Hayakawa M. Kaizawa H. Ohishi T. Workman P. Waterfield M. Parker P.

As for many other kinase inhibitors, this compound appears to be ATP-competitive. Constructs—PIKfyve cDNA in pBluescript vector (kindly provided by A. Shisheva) was used as a template for site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange; Stratagene). Mutant PIKfyve contains a single amino acid substitution (K1831M) within the kinase domain. This residue has been demonstrated to be critical for lipid kinase activity (32Sbrissa D. Ikonomov O.C. Shisheva A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15980-15989Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Both wild-type and mutant PIKfyve were inserted in pEGFP-C1 for mammalian expression. hGH-EGFP plasmid was kindly provided by I. Robinson (33McGuinness L. Magoulas C. Sesay A.K. Mathers K. Carmignac D. Manneville J-B. Christian H. Phillips III, J.A. Robinson I.C.A.F. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 720-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Data analysis was carried out using Student's t test. Experiments were performed at least three times. Values are expressed as mean ± S.E., and data were considered significant at p < 0.05 (*) and p < 0.01 (**) unless otherwise stated (Student's t test). To investigate PIKfyve expression and subcellular localization in neurosecretory cells, a rabbit polyclonal antibody was raised against a peptide corresponding to the last 18 amino acids of mouse PIKfyve. This antibody was expected to cross-react with both rat and human PIKfyve, since the predicted rat PIKfyve orthologue, XM_237127 is identical within this 18-amino acid stretch, and human PIKfyve (32Sbrissa D.

XM_237217 was identified as rat PIKfyve based on data base searches and sequence alignments; the identity between XM_237217 and mouse PIKfyve (NM_011086) is 93% at the amino acid level, and within the kinase domain, the amino acid identity is 99%, and all of the key residues previously identified as being required for both lipid kinase and protein kinase activity are present (32Sbrissa D. Ikonomov O.C. Shisheva A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15980-15989Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 34Ikonomov O.C. Sbrissa D. Mlak K. Shisheva A. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 4742-4754Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). PIKfyve was first identified in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle (35Shisheva A. Sbrissa D. Ikonomov O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 623-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) but has subsequently been reported to have a wider tissue distribution (36Shisheva A. Cell Biol. Int. 2001; 25: 1201-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Our result from the antibody characterization suggested that PC12 cells endogenously express PIKfyve (Fig. S1C). To confirm this, PIKfyve mRNA distribution was investigated in rat adrenal glands, rat brain cortex, PC12 cells, and rat adipose tissue as a positive control (35Shisheva A. Sbrissa D. Ikonomov O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 623-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Using PIKfyve-specific primers, a 310-bp fragment was detected in all samples (Fig. 1A). β-Actin primers were used as a positive control and to standardize the input. No band was detected in samples where the reverse transcriptase was omitted from the reverse transcription reaction, demonstrating an absence of contamination by genomic DNA (data not shown). The identity of the 310-bp amplicon was confirmed as PIKfyve by DNA sequencing (data not shown). The distribution of PIKfyve expression in different rat tissues was also investigated at the protein level by Western blotting (Fig. 1B). Equal amounts of postnuclear supernatants of the tissues indicated were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using anti-PIKfyve antibodies. Fig. 1B shows that PIKfyve is expressed in brain cortex, cerebellum, spinal cord, adrenal glands, liver, spleen, and testis. PIKfyve immunoreactivity could not be detected in heart and kidney samples, which could be due to a lack of expression in these tissues or to low expression below the levels of detection. PIKfyve is distributed between cytosolic and membranous compartments in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (34Ikonomov O.C. Sbrissa D. Mlak K. Shisheva A. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 4742-4754Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 37Shisheva A. Rusin B. Ikonomov O.C. DeMarco C. Sbrissa D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11859-11869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Membrane and cytosolic fractions were prepared from 3T3-L1 adipocytes, PC12 cells, and bovine adrenal chromaffin cells, and PIKfyve distribution was determined by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using anti-PIKfyve antibodies (Fig. 1C). As previously reported, we found more PIKfyve in 3T3-L1 adipocyte cytosol than associated with cellular membranes (37Shisheva A. Rusin B. Ikonomov O.C. DeMarco C. Sbrissa D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11859-11869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In both PC12 and adrenal chromaffin cells, PIKfyve was present in membrane and cytosol fractions. We also ran an equal amount of purified chromaffin granule membranes prepared as previously described (12Meunier F.A. Osborne S.L. Hammond G.R. Cooke F.T. Parker P.J. Domin J. Schiavo G. Mol. Biol.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2424-2434Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Importantly, PIKfyve immunoreactivity was also detected in the granule fraction, suggesting that PIKfyve may be recruited to large dense core vesicles and could play a role in secretory granule function. To investigate a role for PIKfyve in exocytosis, we initially focused on bovine adrenal chromaffin cells, a primary cell that is a widely used model for studying neurosecretion. The localization of PIKfyve on chromaffin granules observed by Western blotting (Fig. 1C) was confirmed by immunocytochemistry using anti-PIKfyve and anti-P18 antibodies (Fig. 2A). P18 is a proteolytic fragment of secretogranin II and a marker of mature secretory granules (27Dittie A.S. Tooze S.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 777-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). PIKfyve immunoreactivity shows both a diffuse and punctate localization, partially co-localizing with P18 positive secretory granules (Fig. 2A). The ability of PIKfyve to regulate LDCV exocytosis was investigated using a novel, specific inhibitor of PIKfyve, YM-201636 (31Jefferies H. Cooke F. Jat P. Koizumi T. Hayakawa M. Kaizawa H. Ohishi T. Workman P. Waterfield M. Parker P. EMBO Rep. 2007; doi:10.1038/sj.embor.7401155Google Scholar). This enabled us to investigate both the acute and chronic effects of PIKfyve inhibition on exocytosis. Chromaffin cells were preincubated for 20 min (Fig. 2, B–D) or overnight (data not shown) with 800 nm YM-201636 or YM-211387, an unrelated PI3K type I inhibitor, prior to stimulating secretion by KCl-evoked depolarization. In acute treatments, YM-201636 treatment significantly potentiated catecholamine secretion by 35 ± 3% (Fig. 2, B–D), whereas YM-211387 had no effect (Fig. 2, C and D). A similar potentiation was observed upon overnight incubation with YM-201636 (dat"

The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex was considerably more active in ChREBP-/- mice because of diminished pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase activity. Greater pyruvate dehydrogenase complex activity caused a stimulation of lactate and pyruvate oxidation, and it significantly impaired fatty acid oxidation in perfused livers from ChREBP-/- mice. This shift in mitochondrial substrate utilization led to a 3-fold reduction of the free cytosolic [NAD+]/[NADH] ratio, a 1.7-fold increase in the free mitochondrial [NAD+]/[NADH] ratio, and a 2-fold decrease in the free cytosolic [ATP]/[ADP][Pi] ratio in the ChREBP-/- liver compared with control. Hepatic pyruvate carboxylase flux was impaired with ChREBP deletion secondary to decreased fatty acid oxidation, increased pyruvate oxidation, and limited pyruvate availability because of reduced activity of liver pyruvate kinase and malic enzyme, which replenish pyruvate via glycolysis and pyruvate cycling. Overall, the shift from fat utilization to pyruvate and lactate utilization resulted in a decrease in the energy of ATP hydrolysis and a hypo-energetic state in the livers of ChREBP-/- mice.

The epigenetic control of expression of the genes encoding the enzymes of fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis pathways resides largely in two transcription factors, sterol-responsive element-binding protein, SREBP 3The abbreviations used are: SREBPsterol-responsive element-binding proteinChREBPcarbohydrate-responsive element-binding proteinWTwild typePDCpyruvate dehydrogenase complexPDKpyruvate dehydrogenase kinasePCpyruvate carboxylaseLPKliver pyruvate kinasePKpyruvate kinaseMEmalic enzymeFFAfree fatty acidPEPCKphosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinaseMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidPEPphosphoenolpyruvate. 3The abbreviations used are: SREBPsterol-responsive element-binding proteinChREBPcarbohydrate-responsive element-binding proteinWTwild typePDCpyruvate dehydrogenase complexPDKpyruvate dehydrogenase kinasePCpyruvate carboxylaseLPKliver pyruvate kinasePKpyruvate kinaseMEmalic enzymeFFAfree fatty acidPEPCKphosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinaseMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidPEPphosphoenolpyruvate. (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2937) Google Scholar), and carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein, ChREBP (2Yamashita H. Takenoshita M. Sakurai M. Bruick R.K. Henzel W.J. Shillinglaw W. Arnot D. Uyeda K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9116-9121Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). The former transcription factor is responsive to increased insulin levels associated with consumption of high carbohydrate diets, whereas the latter is responsive to increased levels of hepatic glucose, independently of insulin. Together, these two transcription factors appear to account for the long term increase in lipogenesis resulting from high carbohydrate intake. Insulin, in response to carbohydrate intake, activates the gene encoding the endoplasmic reticulum protein SREBP, which must be cleaved proteolytically by SREBP cleavage-activating protein, and transported into the nucleus where the transcription factor increases the expression of a number of enzymes of the fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2937) Google Scholar, 3Kuriyama H. Liang G. Engelking L.J. Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell Metab. 2005; 1: 41-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In contrast to the hormone-responsive SREBP, ChREBP activity is responsive to changes in carbohydrate metabolite levels, i.e. specifically to increased hepatic glucose concentration, changes in either cyclic AMP or AMP, and changes in the concentrations of metabolites in the hexose monophosphate pathway. ChREBP is therefore responsive, in a general sense, to the metabolic status of tissue (4Kabashima T. Kawaguchi T. Wadzinski B.E. Uyeda K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5107-5112Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 5Kawaguchi T. Osatomi K. Yamashita H. Kabashima T. Uyeda K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3829-3835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). The activity of ChREBP is controlled by its entry into the nuclear compartment that is impeded by phosphorylation or facilitated by dephosphorylation, thus making it exquisitely sensitive to circulating glucose concentration and cellular energy status (6Kawaguchi T. Takenoshita M. Kabashima T. Uyeda K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13710-13715Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The dependence of ChREBP upon cellular energy status and the activity of protein kinases and protein phosphatases are similar to the short term regulation of hepatic glucose homeostasis by glycolysis and gluconeogenesis mediated by fructose-2,6-P2. The synthesis and degradation of fructose-2,6-P2 is carried out by the bifunctional enzyme termed 6-P-fructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase which is regulated through phosphorylation/dephosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase/protein phosphatase. This latter process is activated by the pentose shunt pathway intermediate, xylulose-5-P (7Liu Y.Q. Uyeda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8824-8830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 8Nishimura M. Uyeda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26341-26346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Similar to short term regulation of carbohydrate homeostasis via regulation of fructose-2,6-P2, the long term regulation of liver pyruvate kinase (LPK) and the lipogenic enzyme gene expression mediated by ChREBP are likewise determined by xylulose-5-P-activated cAMP-dependent protein kinase/protein phosphatase 2A. Phosphorylation of ChREBP by protein kinase A and AMP-dependent protein kinase prevents ChREBP entry into the nucleus and inhibits DNA binding, whereas dephosphorylation by the xylulose-5-P-activated protein phosphatase 2A activates ChREBP.Previous studies (9Iizuka K. Miller B. Uyeda K. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 291: E358-E364Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) of the phenotypic differences between WT and ChREBP-/- mice fed a normal chow diet showed that the ChREBP-/- mice had an increase in plasma glucose from 157 to 190 mg/dl, a 2-fold increase in liver glucose-6-P concentration and a 3-fold increase in liver glycogen compared with control mice. These animals also have a markedly higher liver phosphoenolpyruvate and lower pyruvate concentrations, reflecting their lower LPK activity (10Iizuka K. Bruick R.K. Liang G. Horton J.D. Uyeda K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7281-7286Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). As a result of the lower levels of most of the enzymes of fatty acid synthesis pathway and also malic enzyme, the ChREBP-/- mice have reduced epididymal fat and brown fat mass and lower serum free fatty acid concentration (10Iizuka K. Bruick R.K. Liang G. Horton J.D. Uyeda K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7281-7286Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Hepatic triglyceride content of ChREBP-/- mice were not different from WT mice, reflecting unaltered storage of dietary fat in these animals. Nevertheless, the ChREBP-/- liver appears as though it is deficient in metabolizable substrate, despite a surfeit of energy stores in glycogen and triglyceride, presumably because of reduced rates of lipolysis in adipose tissue and by a decrease in glycolytic flux secondary to a decreased LPK activity.Remarkably, attempts to feed a high sucrose or high fructose diet to ChREBP-/- mice lead to a further decrease in plasma free fatty acids and death by hypothermia and starvation (10Iizuka K. Bruick R.K. Liang G. Horton J.D. Uyeda K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7281-7286Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar), suggesting that the defect in fatty acid synthesis induced in ChREBP-/- mice leads to a deficit of the important energy and heat-producing substrate, free fatty acids. It further suggests that adequate fatty acid synthesis and free fatty acid release is a prerequisite for homothermic life. We therefore examined more thoroughly the effects of ChREBP deletion on hepatic substrate utilization, cellular redox state, and energy status.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials and General Methods—Measurement of hepatic metabolites were performed using slight modifications of conventional methods of enzymatic analysis (11Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. 3rd Ed. VCH Verlagsgesllschaft, Weinheim, Germany1985Google Scholar, 12Lowry O.H. Passonneau J.V. A Flexible System of Enzymatic Analysis. Academic Press Inc., New York1972Google Scholar). 13C-Labeled materials were purchased from Cambridge Isotopes (Andover, MA).Animal Treatments—ChREBP gene-deficient (ChREBP-/-) mice were generated, and the phenotypic characteristics were presented previously (9Iizuka K. Miller B. Uyeda K. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 291: E358-E364Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 10Iizuka K. Bruick R.K. Liang G. Horton J.D. Uyeda K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7281-7286Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Mice were housed in colony cages with a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle and fed a standard chow diet containing 6% fat (Teklad Mouse/Rat Diet 7002 from Harlan Teklad Premier Laboratory Diets) unless otherwise noted. All mice were sacrificed at the end of the dark cycle. For measurement of liver metabolites, mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and the liver was removed and freeze-clamped. For liver perfusion, animals were anesthetized, and the livers were removed for perfusion, with subsequent sacrifice of the animal. All animal experiments were performed with the approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Research Advisory Committee of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center.Substrate Utilization in Perfused Liver—Three days prior to liver perfusions, mice began eating a high starch diet (60% starch, 20% casein, 15% cellulose, 2.5% vitamins, and 2.5% minerals). On the day of the experiment, livers were isolated from fed mice and perfused in a nonrecirculating preparation at 8 ml/min via the portal vein as described previously (13Burgess S.C. Hausler N. Merritt M. Jeffrey F.M.H. Storey C. Milde A. Koshy S. Lindner J. Magnuson M.A. Malloy C.R. Sherry A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48941-48949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The perfusion medium consisted of a standard Krebs-Heinslet buffer containing 1.5 mm [U-13C3]lactate, 0.15 mm [U-13C3]pyruvate, 8 mm [1-13C]glucose, and 0.05 mm free fatty acids (algal mixture of 11.6% palmitoleic, 39.1% palmitic, 14.6% linoleic, and 34.81% oleic acid) and 3% albumin. Livers were perfused for 75 min, and perfusate samples were collected every 15 min to measure oxygen consumption and ketone production. Livers were freeze-clamped, extracted with perchloric acid, and centrifuged. Acid extracts were neutralized with KOH, centrifuged to remove precipitant, and freeze-dried. Extracts were reconstituted in 500 μl of D2O for 13C NMR analysis.Carbon-13 NMR was performed as described previously (13Burgess S.C. Hausler N. Merritt M. Jeffrey F.M.H. Storey C. Milde A. Koshy S. Lindner J. Magnuson M.A. Malloy C.R. Sherry A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48941-48949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Briefly, proton decoupled 13C NMR spectra of liver extracts were acquired in a 5-mm Varian broadband probe using a 45° pulse, 1.5-s acquisition time, and a 1.5-s post-acquisition delay. A WALTZ-16 sequence was used for broadband proton decoupling. 13C NMR multiplets were deconvoluted using NUTS (Acorn NMR, Fremont, CA).Multiplets from [13C]glutamate resonances were used to determine substrate oxidation, anaplerosis, pyruvate cycling, and gluconeogenesis, all relative to tricarboxylic acid cycle flux. Nonsteady state equations were used to determine relative substrate oxidation of lactate and pyruvate, glucose or FFA, using the C3 and C4 multiplets as described previously (14Malloy C.R. Sherry A.D. Jeffrey F.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: H987-H995Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Malloy C.R. Thompson J.R. Jeffrey F.M. Sherry A.D. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6756-6761Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The fraction of FFA oxidation in the tricarboxylic acid cycle represents the total fat oxidized from both the perfusate and endogenous triglycerides. Anaplerosis, pyruvate cycling, and gluconeogenesis were determined from a steady state analysis of glutamate multiplets C2, C3, and C4 using the program tcaCALC (16Jeffrey F.M.H. Storey C.J. Sherry A.D. Malloy C.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: E788-E799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this model, program parameters LAC3, LAC123, anaplerosis, PDC, and PK were allowed to change. YPC (anaplerosis) and PK (pyruvate cycling) are reported relative to total tricarboxylic acid cycle turnover. Gluconeogenesis PEP is taken as the difference between YPC and pyruvate cycling (PK + ME). Pyruvate cycling represents a maximal estimation of LPK flux (relative to tricarboxylic acid cycle turnover) because malic enzyme flux cannot be distinguished from LPK flux.Immunoblot Analysis—Tissue powders (50 mg) prepared under liquid nitrogen were homogenized with 0.5 ml of extraction buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 2% (v/v) bovine serum, 1 μm leupeptin, 10 μm l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone, and 10 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor). Protein concentrations of tissue extracts were determined with a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Fifty μg of protein were separated on a 12.5% (w/v) SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schüll) by the semidry electroblotting method. Western blot analysis was carried out as described previously (17Wu P. Inskeep K. Bowker-Kinley M.M. Popov K.M. Harris R.A. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1593-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) using an enhanced chemiluminescence immunodetection system (Roche Diagnostics). Immunoblotting was performed with polyclonal rabbit antisera against PDK1, PDK2, PDK3, PDK4, and PDC.Measurement of Enzyme Activities and Metabolites—The activities of PDC and its kinase were measured in Triton X-100 tissue extracts as described previously (18Jeoung N.H. Sanghani P.C. Zhai L. Harris R.A. Anal. Biochem. 2006; 356: 44-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The metabolites were determined as described (7Liu Y.Q. Uyeda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8824-8830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 9Iizuka K. Miller B. Uyeda K. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 291: E358-E364Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). ATP was measured spectrophotometrically using hexokinase (EC 2.7.1.1) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.49) by the method described previously (19Lamprecht W. Trautschold I. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. Academic Press, New York1974: 2101-2110Google Scholar). All enzymes used were purchased from Sigma.Calculation of Free Cytosolic Adenine Nucleotides and Nucleotide Ratios in Cytoplasm and Mitochondria—Measurement of total pyridine nucleotides, because of their impermeance to mitochondrial membrane and binding, give no information of the redox state in compartments of interest. Likewise because of intramitochondrial segregation of the bulk of cellular ADP in mitochondria, measurement of total ADP gives no information on the cytosolic free ADP concentration. Therefore, the free nucleotide ratios and numbers were calculated from the measured metabolites of near-equilibrium reactions in the cellular compartment of interest as indicated (20Krebs H.A. Veech R.L. Papa S. Tager J.M. Quagliarello E. Slater E.C. Pyridine Nucleotide Interrelations. Adriatica Editrice, Bari, Italy1969: 329-384Google Scholar). The free cytosolic [NAD+]/[NADH] was calculated from the measured substrates of the lactate dehydrogenase reaction where the Keq is 1.11 × 10-11 m as shown in Equation 1, [NAD+]c[NADH]c=[pyruvate-][lactate-]×10-7.2KLDH(Eq. 1) The free mitochondrial [NAD+]/[NADH] ratio was calculated from the measured substrates of the glutamate dehydrogenase (GlDH) reaction where the KGlDH is 3.87 × 10-13 m2 (21Engel P.C.

Dalziel K. Biochem. J. 1968; 110: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and the CO2 concentration at pH 7.2 was assumed to be 1.99 mm given an intracellular [HCO3-] of 25 mm as shown in Equation 3, [NADP+]c[NADPH]c=[α-ketoglutarate2-][1.99×10-3][isocitrate3-]×1KIcDH(Eq. 3) The free cytosolic [ATP]/[ADP] × [Pi] ratio, or phosphorylation potential, was calculated from the substrates of the combined glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase reaction, the 3-phosphoglycerate kinase reaction, the equilibrium constant of the combined reactions, which is designated as KG+G, and the triose-phosphate isomerase reaction, and the lactate dehydrogenase reaction (23Veech R.L. Lawson J.W. Cornell N.W. Krebs H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 6538-6547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The ΔG′ of ATP hydrolysis was calculated from the ΔG0 of ATP hydrolysis determined at 38 °C, I = 0.25, and free [Mg2+] of 1 mm to be -31.8 kJ/mol (24Guynn R.W. Veech R.L. J. Biol.

From the ΔG′ of ATP hydrolysis determined from the measure of dihydroxyacetone phosphate, 3-phosphoglycerate, lactate, and pyruvate, the free [ADP] was calculated as described previously (20Krebs H.A. Veech R.L. Papa S. Tager J.M. Quagliarello E. Slater E.C. Pyridine Nucleotide Interrelations. Adriatica Editrice, Bari, Italy1969: 329-384Google Scholar), and see Equation 5. freecytosolic[ADP]M=[ATP][Pi]×phosphorylationpotential(Eq. 5) The free cytosolic [AMP] was calculated from the equilibrium constant for the myokinase reaction, which is 1.05 at pH 7.0, and free [Mg2+] = 1mm (25Veech R.L.

Veech R.L. Curr. Top. Cell Regul. 1992; 33: 185-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).Mitochondria Isolation and Oxidative Metabolism—Liver mitochondria were isolated as described (27Krahenbuhl S. Chang M. Brass E.P. Hoppel C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20998-21003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 4 fed WT and ChREBP-/- mice were killed by decapitation between 08:00 and 09:00 a.m. The livers were quickly removed and placed in cold MSN buffer (220 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 5 mm MOPS, pH 7.4). A 10% suspension (w/v) of the minced liver containing 2 mm EDTA and 0.2% bovine serum albumin saturated by oxygen bubbling was prepared using Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer. Nuclei and cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 700 × g for 10 min, and mitochondria were isolated by centrifugation of the supernatant at 7000 × g for 10 min twice. The resulting mitochondrial pellet was washed twice with MSN buffer and diluted to ∼50 mg of mitochondrial protein per ml. Oxygen consumption rate was measured polarographically in a stirred oxygraph vessel. The respiratory medium consisted of 15 mm KCl, 15 mm K2HPO4, 15 mm KH2PO4, 25 mm Tris-HCl, 45 mm sucrose, 12 mm mannitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 7 mm EDTA, and 0.2% bovine serum albumin. ADP was added to a concentration of 5 mm, and pyruvate and lactate were added to give a concentration of 10 mm (+2.5 mm malate). Ascorbic acid and tetramethylphenylenediamine were used at 7.2 and 1 mm, respectively. Succinate and rotenone were used at 10 mm and 1.25 μm, respectively.Measurement of β-Oxidation Rate in Hepatocytes from WT and ChREBP-/- Mice—β-Oxidation of acyl-CoA was measured as the production of tritiated water from [9,10-3H]palmitic acid (9Iizuka K. Miller B. Uyeda K. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 291: E358-E364Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Hepatocytes from WT and ChREBP-/- mice were allowed to attach to culture wells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's culture medium containing 100 nm dexamethasone, 10 nm insulin, and 100 nm 3,3′,5-triiodothyronine and were incubated for 3 h. Nonadherent cells were removed, and the hepatocyte monolayers were incubated an additional3hin Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1 mm palmitate plus [9,10-3H]palmitic acid (Amersham Biosciences). The released [3H]water was measured by allowing to equilibrate in a 20-ml flask containing 1 ml of distilled water, which was tightly sealed with a stopper (Amersham Biosciences). Samples (300 μl) were pipetted into the flasks and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h to allow H2O in the sample to equilibrate with the water in the flask (28Ashcroft S.J.H. Randle P.J. Biochem. J. 1968; 107: 599-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The 3H was counted with a scintillation counter. Under these conditions the water exchange ratio was ∼60%.RESULTSSubstrate Selection in Perfused Liver; ChREBP-/- Mice Shift Hepatic Energy Substrate from Fatty Acids to Pyruvate—Isolated livers were perfused with a mixture of [U-13C]lactate, [U-13C]pyruvate, [1-13C]glucose, and long chain free fatty acids to determine whether hepatic substrate oxidation is altered by ChREBP loss of function. NMR isotopomer analysis of the 13C spectra of liver glutamate was used to measure relative fluxes through substrate oxidation and gluconeogenic pathways (Fig. 1A). Nonsteady state NMR isotopomer analysis of the 13C spectra of liver glutamate was used to determine the fractional oxidation of lactate, pyruvate, and FFAs (15Malloy C.R. Thompson J.R. Jeffrey F.M. Sherry A.D. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6756-6761Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). Lactate and pyruvate oxidation in the hepatic tricarboxylic acid cycle was elevated almost 2-fold in the ChREBP-/- compared with WT mice. Glucose oxidation was minor in both cases and not different between ChREBP-/- and WT mice. The contribution of unlabeled substrates, presumably from fatty acids in the perfusate or endogenous liver triglycerides, accounted for 66% of acetyl-CoA oxidized in the tricarboxylic acid cycle of WT livers but only 39% in the ChREBP-/- liver. Oxygen consumption remained unchanged between the WT and ChREBP-/- livers (Fig. 1C). Although absolute fluxes were not quantitatively assessed, the similarity of oxygen consumption between ChREBP-/- and control livers suggests that tricarboxylic acid cycle flux is similar between the groups and therefore that absolute lactate and pyruvate oxidation is elevated, whereas absolute FFA oxidation is decreased in ChREBP-/- livers compared with WT. Ketone body production by WT livers was small, as expected with livers taken from well fed animals, but livers from ChREBP-/- mice produced even less acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate, consistent with decreased fatty acid oxidation (Fig. 1C).Steady state isotopomer analysis of liver glutamate 13C NMR spectra (16Jeffrey F.M.H. Storey C.J. Sherry A.D. Malloy C.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: E788-E799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was also performed to determine the effect of ChREBP deletion on hepatic anaplerosis, pyruvate cycling, and gluconeogenesis (Fig. 1D). Anaplerosis and cataplerosis relative to tricarboxylic acid cycle flux were taken to represent combined pyruvate carboxylase (PC) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) flux, respectively, relative to tricarboxylic acid cycle turnover and was decreased by more than 2-fold in the ChREBP-/- livers (Fig. 1D). This finding is in agreement with impaired fat oxidation that would tend to decrease PC activity by limiting its allosteric activation by fat-derived acetyl-CoA (29Williamson J.R. Browning E.T. Scholz R. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 4607-4616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The acetyl-CoA concentrations in WT and ChREBP-/- livers were 51 nmol/g liver and 32 nmol/g, respectively, although it is not clear whether PC activation distinguishes fat-derived or PDC-derived acetyl-CoA. Increased pyruvate oxidation observed by NMR and radiolabeled techniques (see below) also accounts for decreased flux through PC because less pyruvate would be available for carboxylation. Despite impaired flux through PC and PEPCK pathways, gluconeogenesis from PEP (GNGPEP) relative to tricarboxylic acid cycle flux was unchanged in the ChREBP-/- livers compared with WT (Fig. 1D), because pyruvate cycling was also decreased by 3-fold, thus sparing substrate for gluconeogenesis in ChREBP-/- mice. Pyruvate cycling refers to any pathway that converts tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates derived from pyruvate back to pyruvate. In the present case, decreased pyruvate cycling presumably results from reduced LPK expression, which would spare PEP from conversion back to pyruvate, or reduced malic enzyme (ME) expression, which would spare malate (and thus oxaloacetate) from conversion to pyruvate. Isotope tracer methods employed here do not distinguish these pyruvate cycling pathways, but suppression of their combined action allows normal gluconeogenesis to be sustained despite impaired pyruvate carboxylase and/or PEPCK flux.Redox and Energy Status of Liver; the Altered Substrate Utilization in ChREBP-/- Mouse Liver Results in Perturbed Redox States of Mitochondria and Cytosol in a Divergent Manner Lowering the Phosphorylation Potential Creating an Energy-deficient Liver—Analysis of intermediary metabolites in freeze-clamped liver of ChREBP-/- mice fed a normal chow diet ad libitum showed no differences in [citrate] or [isocitrate] compared with WT mice. [Dihydroxyacetone phosphate] and [3-phosphoglycerate] were increased 2.8- and 1.7-fold, respectively, consistent with low expression of LPK in ChREBP-/- mice (Table 1). Pyruvate concentration was reduced 2-fold, compatible with inactivation of LPK and ME expression and increased pyruvate oxidation (Fig. 1). Moreover, the concentration of lactate was increased 1.4-fold, indicating a 3-fold reduction in cytosolic NAD+/NADH redox state in the liver of ChREBP-/- mouse relative to WT mice. The more reduced cytosolic NAD+/NADH couple in the liver of ChREBP-/- mice could result from decreased mitochondrial reducing power required for mitochondrial ATP synthesis. Interestingly, there was a 2-fold increase in [α-ketoglutarate] in ChREBP-/- mouse liver but unchanged [glutamate] and [NH4+] (Table 1), indicating that the free mitochondrial [NAD+]/[NADH] ratio was increased 1.7-fold in the liver of ChREBP-/- mouse relative to that of the WT mice (Table 2).TABLE 1Comparison of hepatic content of intermediary metabolites in ChREBP−/− and wild type mice consuming a normal chow dietMetaboliteWild typeChREBP−/−Citrate0.264 ± 0.0180.284 ± 0.017Isocitrate0.0217 ± 0.0020.020 ± 0.002Dihydroxyacetone-P0.0327 ± 0.0020.0921 ± 0.0117ap < 0.01.3-Phosphoglycerate0.413 ± 0.0300.693 ± 0.037ap < 0.01.Pyruvate0.120 ± 0.0100.058 ± 0.007ap < 0.01.l-Lactate1.09 ± 0.091.49 ± 0.09ap < 0.01.l-Glutamate1.28 ± 0.081.51 ± 0.11α-Ketoglutarate0.052 ± 0.0090.105 ± 0.005ap < 0.01.NH4+0.606 ± 0.0180.567 ± 0.035ATP4.1 ± 0.63.1 ± 0.4a p < 0.01.

Recently, we identified Rap1GAP2, a GTPase-activating protein of Rap1 in platelets. Here we show that 14-3-3 proteins interact with phosphorylated serine 9 at the N terminus of Rap1GAP2. Platelet activation by ADP and thrombin enhances serine 9 phosphorylation and increases 14-3-3 binding to endogenous Rap1GAP2. Conversely, inhibition of platelets by endothelium-derived factors nitric oxide and prostacyclin disrupts 14-3-3 binding. These effects are mediated by cGMP- and cAMP-dependent protein kinases that phosphorylate Rap1GAP2 at serine 7, adjacent to the 14-3-3 binding site. 14-3-3 binding does not change the GTPase-activating function of Rap1GAP2 in vitro. However, 14-3-3 binding attenuates Rap1GAP2 mediated inhibition of cell adhesion. Our findings define a novel crossover point of activatory and inhibitory signaling pathways in platelets.

NO and PGI2 activate platelet guanylyl and adenylyl cyclases to produce cGMP and cAMP. In consequence cGMP and cAMP activate cGMP- and cAMP-dependent protein kinases (cGK/PKG and cAK/PKA) that phosphorylate substrate proteins leading to inhibition of platelet activation, adhesion and aggregation (1Hofmann F. Feil R. Kleppisch T. Schlossmann J. Physiol. Rev. 2006; 86: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 2Lohmann S.M. Walter U. Front.

Circulation. 2003; 108: 2172-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). To date only few substrates of cGK/cAKs in platelets have been characterized and the mechanisms mediating platelet inhibition downstream of the substrates are largely unknown. We and others (4Danielewski O. Schultess J. Smolenski A. Thromb. Haemost. 2005; 93: 319-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 5Franke B. Akkerman J.W. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar) have recently detected that cGK and cAK efficiently block agonist-induced formation of Rap1-GTP in platelets. Rap1 is a guanine nucleotide-binding protein that regulates integrin functions and plays a pivotal role in adhesion of many cell types (6Bos J.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 7Hattori M. Minato N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2003; 134: 479-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 8Kinbara K.

Sci. 2003; 28: 267-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In platelets Rap1 is required for adhesion, aggregation and thrombus formation (10Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Smyth S.S. Schoenwaelder S.M. Fischer T.H. White 2nd, G.C. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 680-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Because Rap1 controls integrin function and platelet aggregation, Rap1 inhibition might play a central role in platelet inhibition by NO and PGI2. Rap1 cycles between an active GTP-bound and an inactive GDP-bound conformation. The transition between these two states is controlled by unique guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEF) and GTPase-activating proteins (GAP).In a previous study we identified Rap1GAP2, the only known GAP of Rap1 in platelets (11Schultess J. Danielewski O. Smolenski A.P. Blood. 2005; 105: 3185-3192Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in vitro experiments provided preliminary evidence for cGK- and cAK-mediated phosphorylation of Rap1GAP2 (11Schultess J. Danielewski O. Smolenski A.P. Blood. 2005; 105: 3185-3192Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Rap1GAP2 contains a central conserved GAP domain as well as large N- and C-terminal regions of unknown function. We hypothesized that these regions might be involved in protein/protein interactions and performed a genetic screening in yeast to identify Rap1GAP2-interacting proteins. In the present work we establish the phosphoserine/phosphothreonine-binding protein 14-3-3 as major interaction partner of Rap1GAP2 and map its binding site to the N terminus of Rap1GAP2. We show that the formation of the Rap1GAP2/14-3-3 protein complex is regulated by two phosphorylation events in platelets. ADP and thrombin stimulate phosphorylation of the 14-3-3 binding serine residue, whereas the previously described phosphorylation of Rap1GAP2 by cGK and cAK inhibits 14-3-3 binding. Our data suggest that Rap1GAP2 represents an intersection point of activatory and inhibitory pathways in platelets.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Human thrombin, ADP, wortmannin, YC-1, DEA-NOate, DETA-NOate, sodium-nitroprusside (SNP), and forskolin were obtained from Sigma (Taufkirchen, Germany). Human fibronectin was purchased from Calbiochem (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). 8-pCPT-cGMP, 8-Br-cAMP, Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPS, and Rp-8-Br-cAMPS were from Biolog (Bremen, Germany), prostacyclin (PGI2) was from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI), LY294002 and triciribine were from Biomol (Hamburg, Germany), bisindolylmaleimide I, rottlerin, PKCα and PKCδ were from Axxora (Lörrach, Germany), PKB was from Jena Bioscience (Jena, Germany) and protein phosphatase 1 was obtained from New England Biolabs (Frankfurt, Germany).To detect Rap1GAP2 a previously described polyclonal antibody (11Schultess J. Danielewski O. Smolenski A.P. Blood. 2005; 105: 3185-3192Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) was used. Commercially available antibodies were used for detection of 14-3-3 (H-8, K-19, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), HA tag (HA.11, Covance, Princeton, NJ), Myc tag (4A6 from Upstate, Dundee, UK or 9E10 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and FLAG tag (M2, Sigma). Horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rabbit and goat anti-mouse were from Dianova (Hamburg, Germany).Cloning of Rap1GAP2 was described before (11Schultess J. Danielewski O. Smolenski A.P. Blood. 2005; 105: 3185-3192Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In the present work only the Rap1GAP2a isoform was used. Rap1GAP2 was FLAG-tagged at the C terminus and expressed using the mammalian expression vector pcDNA4/TO (Invitrogen). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by polymerase chain reaction amplification of Rap1GAP2-FLAG-pcDNA4/TO using mutagenic primer pairs, Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla), digestion with DpnI (Fermentas, St. Leon-Rot, Germany) and transformation in XL-10 Gold bacteria. Full size 14-3-3β cDNA, obtained from the yeast two-hybrid screen, was cloned together with a C-terminal Myc epitope into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA4/TO (Invitrogen). To produce purified GST-tagged 14-3-3β and 14-3-3ζ, full-size cDNAs, obtained from the yeast two-hybrid screen, were cloned into pGEX-4T3 vector (GE Healthcare, Freiburg, Germany). For GST pulldown assay, full-length GST-14-3-3β and GST-14-3-3ζ were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21. The resultant GST fusion proteins were purified on GSH-Sepharose. Rap1 and Rap1GAP1 constructs were kindly provided by J. Bos (Department of Physiological Chemistry, Utrecht, The Netherlands).Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—The MATCHMAKER Two-Hybrid System 3 (Clontech-Takara Bio, Saint-Germain-en-Laye, France) was used for yeast two-hybrid screening. Full-length Rap1GAP2 was subcloned into pGBKT7 bait vector, creating a fusion protein with the Gal4 DNA-binding domain. The bait vector and 3.5 × 106 cfu of a human adult brain cDNA library cloned into pACT2 prey vector were introduced into the AH109 yeast strain. A high-stringency screen was performed according to the manufacturer's instruction.Cell Culture and Transfection—COS-1 and HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C and ambient air supplemented with 5% CO2. Transient transfections of COS-1 cells were performed with DEAE-dextran. In brief, 6 × 105 cells were seeded per 10 cm dish. On the following day cells were washed with PBS, and expression plasmids were applied in 5.7 ml of serum-free medium mixed with 300 μl of DEAE-dextran (1 mg/ml stock) and 12 μl of chloroquine (100 mm stock). After incubation for 2 h, the transfection mixture was removed, and the cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% FCS for 24-48 h prior to use. HeLa cells were transiently transfected using Metafectene (Biontex, Martinsried, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Platelet Preparation—Venous blood was drawn from healthy volunteers taking no medications, who gave their informed consent according to the declaration of Helsinki. Washed platelets were obtained by sequential centrifugation as previously described (4Danielewski O. Schultess J. Smolenski A. Thromb. Haemost. 2005; 93: 319-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).Antibody Production—The anti-phospho-Rap1GAP2 pS7 and pS9 antibodies were produced using the phosphorylated MFGRKRpSVSFGGFC or MFGRKRSVpSFGGFC peptides conjugated to KLH via cysteine obtained from Schafer-N (Copenhagen, Denmark). Immunization of rabbits and subsequent purification of the antipeptide antibody with immunizing peptides and the non-phosphorylated MFGRKRSVSFGGFC peptide was performed by ImmunoGlobe Antikörpertechnik GmbH (Himmelstadt, Germany).Preparation of Cell Lysates—Adherent COS-1 or HeLa cells were washed three times with PBS and detached by scraping with a rubber policeman. The lysates were prepared by resuspending washed platelets or washed cells in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2 with phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm Na4P2O7) and protease inhibitors (2 μg/μl aprotinin, 1 μg/μl leupeptin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After 20 min, the lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min to remove insoluble material.Immunoprecipitation, in Vitro Phosphorylation, and Pulldown Experiments—Proteins were immunoprecipitated from 500 μl of lysate by addition of 5 μl of ANTI-FLAG M2 Affinity Gel (Sigma) or 2 μg of anti-Myc antibody (Upstate) at 4 °C for 2 h. In case of immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc after 1 h, 7 μl of protein A/G-Agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added. In vitro phosphorylation of precipitated proteins was performed as described (11Schultess J. Danielewski O. Smolenski A.P. Blood. 2005; 105: 3185-3192Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) using purified recombinant protein kinases. In pulldown experiments 5 μl of glutathione-Sepharose bead suspension (GE Healthcare) saturated with GST-14-3-3β, GST-14-3-3ζ or GST-Rip2 were added to 500 μl of platelet or cell lysate and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h or overnight. The beads were washed five times with lysis buffer before adding 20 μl of 3 × SDS-buffer and boiling for 5 min. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and identified by immunoblotting as described before (11Schultess J. Danielewski O. Smolenski A.P. Blood. 2005; 105: 3185-3192Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Shown data are representative of at least three independent experiments.Phosphopeptide Binding Assays—Peptides with the sequences MFGRKRpSVSFGGFC (pS7), MFGRKRSVpSFGGFC (pS9), and MFGRKRpSVpSFGGFC (pS7-pS9) corresponding to the N terminus of Rap1GAP2 coupled to Sepharose beads via cysteine were obtained from Immunoglobe Antikörpertechnik GmbH. Peptide beads were incubated with 100 ng of purified recombinant GST-14-3-3β in 500 μl of PBS buffer with 0.1% Tween 20, 0.3% Triton-X-100 and 1% BSA for 15 min at 4 °C. Then beads were washed with the same buffer lacking BSA and bound GST-14-3-3 was eluted by boiling in SDS-buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot. Shown data are representative of three independent experiments.In Vitro GAP Assay—The coding sequence of amino acids 1-167 of human Rap1B was fused at the N terminus to a hexahistidine tag in the bacterial expression vector pET28 (Merck). Recombinant His-Rap1B was purified from E. coli using Ni-NTA. For GTP loading 25 μm His-Rap1B was incubated with 125 nm [32P]GTP (800 Ci/mmol, 10 μCi/μl, obtained from Hartmann Analytic, Braunschweig, Germany) in the presence of 25 μm cold GTP, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTE, and 30 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5 for 1 h at room temperature. The exchange reaction was stopped by adding 20 mm MgCl2 and non-incorporated nucleotides were removed by gel filtration using NAP-5 columns (GE Healthcare). FLAG-tagged Rap1GAP2 proteins were purified from transfected HeLa cells using ANTI-FLAG M2 Affinity Gel. Rap1GAP2 proteins bound to beads were incubated with purified [32P]GTP-loaded His-Rap1B in a buffer containing 30 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm DTE in 50-μl aliquots at 25 °C. After different times, 5-μl aliquots were removed and mixed with 395 μl of a cold 5% (w/v) charcoal suspension in 20 mm phosphoric acid. After centrifugation, 200 μl of supernatant was removed, mixed with scintillation fluid, and counted.Adhesion Assays—96-well plates were coated overnight at 4 °C with 20 μg/ml fibronectin in PBS, washed with PBS, and blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 0.5% BSA in PBS. After washing, 50 μl of DMEM were added per well. HeLa cells were transiently transfected with pRluc (BioSignal Packard, Meriden) and wild-type or mutant Rap1GAP2. Cells were washed, detached with 0.05% ETDA in PBS, spun down and resuspended in DMEM containing 10% FCS at a concentration of 2 × 105 cells/ml. 50 μl of cell suspension was added per well of prepared plate. After spinning down the cells for 1 min at 10 × g, they were allowed to adhere for 50 min at 37 °C. Non-adherent cells were removed by washing with prewarmed 0.5% BSA in PBS. Adherent cells were lysed and subjected to luciferase assay using the Renilla Luciferase Assay System (Promega, Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Expression levels of transfected constructs were confirmed by immunoblotting. Numbers of bound cells were calculated and corrected for transfection efficiency by measuring luciferase activity of total input cells.RESULTSRap1GAP2 Interacts with 14-3-3—To identify Rap1GAP2-associated proteins we performed yeast two-hybrid screening. We used full-length wild-type Rap1GAP2a, the predominant splice isoform of Rap1GAP2 in platelets, as a bait in a screen of a two-hybrid human adult brain cDNA library. Out of 112 positive clones 18 were identified as 14-3-3β and 2 clones were 14-3-3ζ. 14-3-3 proteins are phosphoserine/phosphothreonine-binding molecules that mediate phosphorylation dependent effects of signaling (12Aitken A.

To verify that Rap1GAP2 and 14-3-3 interact in intact mammalian cells we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments. COS-1 cells were transfected with epitope-tagged versions of Rap1GAP2 and 14-3-3β. Immunoprecipitates of 14-3-3 were examined for the presence of Rap1GAP2 by immunoblot. Rap1GAP2 was present only in samples containing 14-3-3 (Fig. 1A, first lane). We confirmed binding to 14-3-3 in a reverse experiment, using FLAG-tagged Rap1GAP2 (Fig. 1A, third lane).Rap1GAP2 is the so far only known GAP of Rap1 in platelets (11Schultess J. Danielewski O. Smolenski A.P. Blood. 2005; 105: 3185-3192Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To verify the Rap1GAP2/14-3-3 interaction in platelets we constructed GST-fusion proteins of 14-3-3β and ζ isoforms (both isoforms were identified in the initial yeast two-hybrid screening) and performed pulldown experiments. Both, 14-3-3β and ζ, bound to endogenous Rap1GAP2 with equal potency whereas a control GST-GFP fusion protein did not bind Rap1GAP2 (Fig. 1B). To determine if 14-3-3 proteins also bind to other RapGAPs we tested Rap1GAP1, a closely related protein that exhibits about 50% overall identity with Rap1GAP2 (11Schultess J. Danielewski O. Smolenski A.P. Blood. 2005; 105: 3185-3192Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 17Daumke O. Weyand M. Chakrabarti P.P. Vetter I.R. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 2004; 429: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). No interaction between Rap1GAP1 and 14-3-3β could be detected in co-immunoprecipitation experiments in transfected HeLa cells (Fig. 1C).To determine the 14-3-3 binding site(s) within Rap1GAP2 we generated mutants containing either the N-terminal 121 residues (N-term) or residues 121 to 715 (C-term) of Rap1GAP2. Only the N-terminal Rap1GAP2 construct, but not the C-terminal construct, co-precipitated with 14-3-3 from transfected HeLa cell lysates (Fig. 1D, second and third lane). To define the 14-3-3 interacting region of Rap1GAP2 more precisely we looked for consensus 14-3-3 binding sites (13Bridges D. Moorhead G.B. Sci. STKE. 2005; (2005, re10)PubMed Google Scholar, 18Yaffe M.B. Rittinger K. Volinia S. Caron P.R. Aitken A. Leffers H. Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 91: 961-971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar). The N terminus of Rap1GAP2 exhibits a region resembling a mode I consensus motif for 14-3-3 binding (RSXpSXP, where X denotes any amino acid residue and pS represents phosphorylated serine). The Rap1GAP2 sequence RSVSFG (residues 6-11) differs only in the final glycine residue from the mode I consensus. We tested the role of this motif for 14-3-3 binding in co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Deletion of the 13 N-terminal residues of Rap1GAP2 resulted in loss of 14-3-3 binding (ΔN13 in Fig. 1D). We conclude that Rap1GAP2 contains one 14-3-3 binding site that localizes to the very N terminus.Characterization of the 14-3-3 Binding Motif of Rap1GAP2—Alignment of the Rap1GAP2 N-terminal sequence with mode I and mode II consensus sequences for 14-3-3 binding is shown in Fig. 2A. The mode I motif matches best to the Rap1GAP2 N terminus and both motifs predict serine 9 as the critical phosphorylated serine residue required for 14-3-3 binding. To test this prediction we mutated serine 9 of Rap1GAP2 and performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments with 14-3-3β. Mutation of serine 9 to alanine (S9A) completely abolished 14-3-3 binding (Fig. 2B, third lane). Neither mutation of Rap1GAP2 serine 9 to glutamic acid (S9E, Fig. 2B, fourth lane) nor to aspartic acid (not shown) restored 14-3-3 binding. This observation agrees with the notion that only phosphorylated serine or threonine residues interact with the basic pocket in the 14-3-3 binding groove (19Gardino A.K. Smerdon S.J. Yaffe M.B. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2006; 16: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar).FIGURE 214-3-3 binds to serine 9 of Rap1GAP2 and binding is blocked by phosphorylation of serine 7. A, alignment of Rap1GAP2 N-terminal sequence with type I and type II consensus motifs for 14-3-3 binding. pS indicates phosphorylated serine. Matching residues are boxed and identical residues are additionally shaded in gray. B, serine 9 of Rap1GAP2 is required for binding to 14-3-3. HeLa cells were cotransfected with Myc-tagged 14-3-3 and FLAG-tagged wild-type Rap1GAP2 or mutants of Rap1GAP2 having the serine 9 residue mutated either to alanine (S9A) or to glutamic acid (S9E). Cells were lysed, Rap1GAP2 was precipitated and 14-3-3 binding was analyzed as described in Fig. 1D. C, mutation of Rap1GAP2 serine 7 to glutamic acid blocks 14-3-3 binding. HeLa cells were cotransfected with Myc-tagged 14-3-3 and FLAG-tagged wild-type or mutant Rap1GAP2. 14-3-3 binding was analyzed as described (Fig. 1D). D, 14-3-3 binds to phosphorylated serine 9 containing peptides and additional phosphorylation of serine 7 abolishes binding. Synthetic peptides containing phosphorylated serines 7, 9 or both were coupled to Sepharose beads and used to pull down GST-14-3-3β. Sepharose beads alone were used as control. Binding was determined by immunoblot using anti-14-3-3. E, serines 7 and 9 of Rap1GAP2 regulate binding to endogenous 14-3-3. HeLa cells transfected with wild-type or mutant FLAG-tagged Rap1GAP2 were lysed and FLAG-containing proteins were precipitated using specific antibodies. Co-precipitated endogenous 14-3-3 was visualized by immunoblot (upper panel). The lower panel shows expression controls for transfected Rap1GAP2 and for endogenous 14-3-3. F, serines 7 and 9 of Rap1GAP2 regulate binding to 14-3-3β and ζ isoforms. COS-1 cells were transfected with wild-type FLAG-tagged Rap1GAP2 or with various point mutants having serines 7 and 9 changed to alanine or glutamic acid alone and in combination as indicated. Equal amounts of GST fusion proteins of 14-3-3β (upper panel) and 14-3-3ζ (middle panel) coupled to GSH-Sepharose beads were used for precipitation. Bound proteins were visualized by immunoblot analysis with a FLAG-specific antibody. The lower panel shows the expression levels of Rap1GAP2 proteins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The 14-3-3 binding motif of Rap1GAP2 includes serine 7 that we have previously identified as phosphorylation site for cyclic nucleotide dependent protein kinases cGK and cAK in vitro (11Schultess J. Danielewski O. Smolenski A.P. Blood. 2005; 105: 3185-3192Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We generated point mutants to determine if Rap1GAP2 serine 7 phosphorylation affects 14-3-3 binding. A serine 7 to alanine mutant (S7A) coprecipitated 14-3-3β similar to wild-type Rap1GAP2 (Fig. 2C). In contrast, a glutamic acid mutant (S7E) did not bind 14-3-3 at all (Fig. 2C). These results indicate that serine 7 is not essential for 14-3-3 binding, however, phosphorylation of serine 7 might inhibit binding. To verify the roles of phosphorylated serines 7 and 9 of Rap1GAP2 for 14-3-3 binding we generated short peptides corresponding to the N terminus of Rap1GAP2 containing either phosphorylated serine 7 or 9, or both residues phosphorylated. These peptides were coupled to beads and used to pull down purified recombinant 14-3-3β. Only the serine 9 phosphorylated peptide bound to 14-3-3, whereas peptides containing phosphorylated serine 7 either alone or in combination with phosphorylated serine 9, did not bind to 14-3-3 (Fig. 2D). To test if binding of endogenous 14-3-3 to Rap1GAP2 would also depend on serines 7 and 9, we transfected HeLa cells with wild-type or mutant Rap1GAP2. S7A mutant Rap1GAP2 precipitated endogenous 14-3-3 similar to wild-type Rap1GAP2, whereas phosphomimetic mutants of serine 7 either to glutamic acid (Fig. 2E) or to aspartic acid (data not shown) did not bind to 14-3-3. Mutation of serine 9 abolished 14-3-3 binding, as observed before (Fig. 2E). To confirm the role of serines 7 and 9 of Rap1GAP2 for 14-3-3 binding in a vice versa approach we performed pulldown experiments using 14-3-3β and ζ to precipitate the different Rap1GAP2 mutants. Both 14-3-3 isoforms precipitated wild-type and S7A mutant Rap1GAP2 from cell lysates equally well (Fig. 2F). All other mutations of serines 7 or 9 abolished binding of 14-3-3β and ζ. These data confirm that serine 9 is required for binding of 14-3-3 proteins to Rap1GAP2. Furthermore, serine 7 appears to represent a regulatory site that inhibits 14-3-3 binding to Rap1GAP2 in case of phosphorylation of this site.Platelet Activation Induces Rap1GAP2 Serine 9 Phosphorylation and Stimulates 14-3-3 Binding—To confirm the physiological significance of our findings on the regulation of the Rap1GAP2 14-3-3 interaction by phosphorylation we developed specific antibodies against the phosphorylated serine 7 and serine 9 sites. To test the specificity of the phosphoserine 9 antibody we expressed wild-type Rap1GAP2 and phosphorylation site mutants in HeLa cells. Immunoblotting with the pS9 antibody resulted in a single strong band in HeLa cells transfected with wild-type Rap1GAP2, which indicates that Rap1GAP2 is phosphorylated on serine 9 already in the basal state (Fig. 3A). In case of mutation of serine 9 to alanine or to glutamic acid the pS9 antibody did not detect Rap1GAP2 (Fig. 3A). Mutations of serine 7 reduced the signal of the pS9 antibody, especially if phosphomimetic residues were introduced. The reduction of the signal can be explained by the fact that serine 7 is included in the epitope recognized by the pS9 antibody (Fig. 3A). Treatment of purified Rap1GAP2 from transfected HeLa cells with protein phosphatase 1 resulted in a loss of the pS9 signal (Fig. 3B). Taken together the data confirm that the pS9 antibody is specific for serine 9 phosphorylated Rap1GAP2, even if the absence of a serine residue at position 7 might reduce binding of the pS9 antibody.FIGURE 3Platelet activation stimulates phosphorylation of Rap1GAP2 at serine 9 and increases 14-3-3 binding. A, characterization of a phosphospecific antibody against serine 9-phosphorylated Rap1GAP2. HeLa cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged wild-type and various point mutants of Rap1GAP2. Cells were lysed, total cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted using a purified antibody specific for Rap1GAP2 phosphorylated on serine 9 (pS9-Rap1GAP2) and for total Rap1GAP2 using an antibody against the FLAG tag as control. B, 14-3-3 binding to Rap1GAP2 is abolished upon phosphatase treatment. HeLa cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged Rap1GAP2. One day after transfection cells were lysed, and Rap1GAP2 was immunoprecipitated using an antibody against the FLAG tag. The precipitates were incubated without or with 15 units of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) for 1.5 h at 30 °C and analyzed with the pS9-Rap1GAP2 antibody and for total Rap1GAP2 (anti-FLAG) as control. C, ADP and thrombin enhance Rap1GAP2 serine 9 phosphorylation and 14-3-3 binding to Rap1GAP2 in platelets. Platelets were treated without or with 10 μm ADP for 1 min or with 0.1 units/ml thrombin for 30 s. Then cells were lysed, and total cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblot using anti-pS9-Rap1GAP2 and anti-Rap1GAP2 (first and second panels from top). The same lysates were incubated with purified recombinant GST-14-3-3β or GST alone as control to pull down endogenous Rap1GAP2. Precipitates were washed and bound proteins were analyzed by immunoblot using anti-Rap1GAP2 (third and fourth panels from top). D, thrombin enhances binding of endogenous 14-3-3 and Rap1GAP2 in platelets. In a control experiment COS-1 cells (left panels) were transfected with 14-3-3 and without or with Rap1GAP2. Cells were lysed, and a GST fusion protein of the Rap1GAP2-interacting protein 2 (Rip2) was used to pull down Rap1GAP2 and indirectly also 14-3-3 bound to Rap1GAP2. Precipitated 14-3-3 was detected by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting of 14-3-3 using anti-14-3-3 (blot: 14-3-3). Amounts of precipitated Rap1GAP2 were controlled by immunoblotting of the precipitates using anti-Rap1GAP2 (blot: Rap1GAP2). In parallel, total cell lysates were analyzed for the expression of 14-3-3 (total 14-3-3) and Rap1GAP2 (total Rap1GAP2). Platelets (right panels) were treated with thrombin as indicated followed by lysis and pulldown assay using either GST alone or GST-Rip2. The presence of endogenous 14-3-3 and Rap1GAP2 in the precipitates as well as total protein levels were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using specific antibodies.View Large"

A key component of this enzymatic system is the selenoprotein thioredoxin reductase 1 (TrxR1), encoded by the TXNRD1 gene. Transcription of TXNRD1 involves alternative splicing, leading to a number of transcripts also encoding isoforms of TrxR1 that differ from each other at their N-terminal domains. Here we have studied the TXNRD1_v3 isoform containing an atypical N-terminal glutaredoxin (Grx) domain. Expression of the transcript of this isoform was found predominantly in testis but was also detected in ovary, spleen, heart, liver, kidney, and pancreas. By immunohistochemical analysis in human testis with antibodies specific for the Grx domain of TXNRD1_v3, the protein was found to be predominantly expressed in the Leydig cells. Expression of the TXNRD1_v3 transcript was also found in several cancer cell lines (HCC1937, H23, A549, U1810, or H157), and in HeLa cells, it was induced by estradiol or testosterone treatments. Surprisingly, green fluorescent protein fusions with the complete TXNRD1_v3 protein or with only its Grx domain localized to distinct cellular sites in proximity to actin, and furthermore, had a potent capacity to rapidly induce cell membrane protrusions. Analyses of these structures suggested that the Grx domain of TXNRD1_v3 localizes first in the emerging protrusion and is then followed into the protrusions by actin and subsequently by tubulin. The results presented thus reveal that TXNRD1_v3 has a unique and distinct expression pattern in human cells and suggest that the protein can guide actin polymerization in relation to cell membrane restructuring.

The many functions of the thioredoxin system are mainly carried out by the interaction of thioredoxins with target proteins, most often involving redox reactions whereby thioredoxin reduces a disulfide in the target protein. For this purpose, the active site disulfide thioredoxin first has to be reduced to a dithiol, which is catalyzed by TrxR using NADPH, and hence, making TrxR a key player for essentially all downstream cellular functions regulated by the thioredoxin system. thioredoxin thioredoxin reductase thioredoxin reductase 1 human mitochondrial TrxR isoenzyme encoded by the TXNRD2 gene splice variant of human TrxR1 encoded by the β1 transcript of the TXNRD1 gene glutaredoxin peptide antibodies raised against part of the Grx domain of v3 green fluorescent protein human thioredoxin glutathione reductase encoded by the TXNRD3 gene fusion construct of v3 fused at its C-terminal end to GFP fusion construct of the Grx domain of v3 fused at its C-terminal end to GFP short form notation for the human TrxR1 splice variant protein TXNRD1_v3 Tris-buffered saline phosphate-buffered saline 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole estrogen receptor.

In the present study, we have characterized further a rare alternative transcript derived from the TXNRD1 gene that expresses an atypical N-terminal Grx domain fused to the TrxR1 module and encoded by alternative exons located upstream of the core promoter. Adhering to the generally proposed nomenclature for human genes, we originally named the transcript β1 and its encoded protein isoform TXNRD1_v3 (7Rundlöf A-K. Janard M. Miranda-Vizuete A.

For ease of readability, the TXNRD1_v3 protein is hereafter referred to as version three (“v3”) of TrxR1. In Scheme 1, the exon organization of the 5′-region of the v3 transcript (β1) is depicted and compared with the other main isoforms of human TrxR1, with the localization of the different primers and probes used in this study also shown in the scheme. The Grx domain of v3 has an atypical CTRC active site sequence (7Rundlöf A-K. Janard M. Miranda-Vizuete A. Arnér E.S.J. Free Rad. Biol.

This Grx domain of v3 was earlier found to lack activity in any of the classical Grx assays, except if the CTRC active site was mutated to the classical CPYC motif whereupon the protein gained typical Grx activity (25Su D.

A PCR fragment composed of the three first exons of the Grx domain of the TXNRD1_v3 was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (Rediprime random primer labeling kit; Amersham Biosciences) and hybridized at 65 °C overnight in ExpressHyb solution (Clontech) following the protocol. The blots were also hybridized with human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as control. The blots were scanned and quantified with the Gel-Pro Analyzer program (Media Cybernetics). PCR Analyses—First-strand cDNA panels from various tissues were obtained from Clontech. The β1 variant cDNA cloned into a pET vector (Novagen) served as a positive control when used as template in the PCR reactions. The cDNA of the different cancer cell lines used here was generously provided by Christopher Horst Lillig, Christoph Hudemann, and Maria Lönn (Karolinska Institutet). The following primers were used: R5, 5′-GCA ACC CAC ATT CAC ACA TGT TCC TCC-3′; R2, 5′-GGA CCA TGG CCG CCT ATC TTT CTC TGT TTC ACA AAC AC-3′; FI, 5′-GAG TCC TGA AGG AGG GCC TGA TGT CTT CAT CAT TCT C-3′; and Fβ-VIII, 5′-CAA GCA CAA AAT AAG GAA CAC ACA GAG ATT TAA ATA ACA G-3′. For PCR reactions, 2.5 units/reaction Taq polymerase, 10 μm of each primer, and 2-3 μl of cDNA template were used. Reactions were heated to 96 °C for 1 min before the first of 35 cycles (94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 2 min) followed by 72 °C for 3 min after the final cycle and then paused at 4 °C. PCR products were analyzed on 1.2% agarose gels with 5 μl of sample loaded. Sequencing reactions of some DNA bands were performed to verify the sequence of PCR products. Immunohistochemistry—Paraffin-embedded testis tissue slides (ProSci) were dewaxed and rehydrated by placing the slides in three changes of xylene for 3 min each time followed by three changes of ethanol (99.5% for 2 × 5 min, 95% for 2 × 4 min, 70% for 1 × 5 min) and then hydrated at 37 °C for 3 min. For antigen retrieval, slides were immersed into a solution of pH 7.8 containing 0.1 g of CaCl2 and 0.1 g of chymotrypsin (from bovine pancreas) in water at 37 °C. After removing the slides, they were placed in cold water and rinsed twice with TBS containing 0.025% Triton X-100. Slides were blocked in 10% normal goat serum (DAKO) with 1% bovine serum albumin in TBS for 2 h at room temperature and subsequently drained and wiped around the sections. Polyclonal rabbit antibodies, α-TXNRD1_v3 (α-v3), were made by AgriSera against the synthetic v3-derived peptide (NH2-CKGKNGDGRRWSAKDHH-PGK-COOH), with the underlined cysteine residue added for maleimide-linked conjugation of keyhole limpet hemocyanin protein as immunization carrier. The peptide sequence is encoded by exons β-VIII and β-VI (Scheme 1). The antibodies were eluted at pH 7.0 from affinity-purified rabbit IgG and kept in PBS with 20% glycerol (0.497 mg/ml) and used as primary antibodies. The slides were incubated overnight at 4 °C with a 1:200 dilution of α-v3 primary antibodies in 200 μl of TBS with 1% bovine serum albumin. For the preabsorption control, the same synthetic peptide antigen (500 μg) used for raising the antibodies was added to the primary antibody solution. Subsequently, the slides were rinsed for 2 × 5 min in TBS with 0.025% Triton X-100. Slides were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with biotinylated goat α-rabbit secondary antibody (DAKO) in a 1:200 dilution in TBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin. Slides were rinsed for 2 × 5 min in TBS. Streptavidin antibody complexed with horseradish peroxidase (DAKO) were applied to the slides in TBS for 30 min at room temperature. Slides were rinsed 2 × 5 min with TBS and developed with chromogen (diaminobenzidine, DAKO) for 10 min at room temperature. Following another rinse under running tap water for 5 min, slides were counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin (DAKO) for 2 min. Then, slides were rinsed with water and counterstained with eosin for 2 s, rinsed again with water, and finally mounted using fluorescent mounting medium (DAKO). Transfection Experiments—v3-GFP, v3(Grx)-GFP or TrxR1 module-GFP fusion constructs were made using a human expressed sequence tag clone for TXNRD1_v3 (GenBank™ accession number BG772375) as template for PCR. The following forward primers were used: v3 GFP forward, 5′-CTG AAT TCG CCA CCA TGG GCT GCG CCG-3′ or TrxR1 GFP forward, 5′-CTG AAT TCG CCA CCA TGG ACG GCC CTG-3′ (both introducing an EcoRI site and designed for construction of a Kozac sequence) in combination with the following reverse primer: v3/TrxR GFP reverse, 5′-ATG GAT CCG CAG CCA GCC TGG AG-3′ (introducing a BamHI site). Cloning of the final desired target constructs for transfection experiments was made using the pEGFP-N3 vector (Clontech), fusing the GFP at the C-terminal end of the protein domains and for the TrxR1 module-encoding transcripts excluding both the selenocysteine residue and the 3′-untranslated region of the cDNA, essentially as described previously (29Damdimopoulos A.E.

HEK293 and HeLa cells were grown on glass coverslips until they reached ∼80% confluency. Subsequently, cells were transfected with the constructs using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. We used various concentrations of DNA ranging from 0.25 to 1 μg/well on a six-well plate, without any differences observed. Cells were fixed 16 h after transfection in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature and then permeabilized with PBS-T (PBS with 0.1% Tween 20) for 3 × 5-min washes followed by a blocking step using 5% normal goat serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) in PBS-T. Subsequently, after a short wash in PBS-T, cells were incubated with a monoclonal anti-β-tubulin antibody (T4026, Sigma) diluted 1:200 in PBS-T for 1 h followed by 3 × 5-min washes. The tubulin antibody was detected using a goat anti-mouse antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 568 (Molecular Probes) diluted 1:500, whereas the actin network was visualized using phalloidin Alexa Fluor 647 (Molecular Probes) diluted 1:40 in PBS-T. After a 1-h incubation, cells were washed briefly and stained with DAPI (Molecular Probes) for 5 min and then washed 3 × 5 min in PBS-T before mounting using fluorescence mounting medium (Calbiochem). For co-staining of estrogen receptors ERα and ERβ, cells were treated with 10 nm estradiol and stained essentially as described before (29Damdimopoulos A.E. Miranda-Vizuete A. Treuter E. Gustafsson J.Å. Spyrou G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38721-38729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Fluorescence Microscopy—For the imaging, we employed a Leica AS MDW fluorescence microscope (Leica Microsystems). DAPI, GFP, and Alexa Fluor 568 were excited, and fluorescence was detected using a triple band-pass filter cube (Leica Microsystems) with the excitation wavelengths/band-pass of 420/30, 495/12, and 570/20 and the emission wavelengths/band-pass of 465/20, 530/30, and 640/40. Separation of the fluorophores was achieved by adjusting the excitation wavelength of the monochromator. For the phalloidin Alexa Fluor 647, a separate filter was used, a Cy5 filter (Chroma) with excitation and emission wavelengths of 620/60 and 700/75. Image stacks were obtained with a step size of 0.25 μm in the z-direction and then deconvolved using the AutoQuant blind deconvolution algorithm. Images were then pseudocolored and prepared in PhotoShop software (Adobe). The live cell experiments were performed using the AS MDW as well, with the difference that the z-stacks obtained had a 0.5-μm step size. For production of the movie, the transfected cells were followed for 1 h with a z-stack obtained every minute and were deconvolved as described previously and composed into a single file. Expression of v3 in Human Tissues and Cells—As the human v3 transcript has only been identified from rare expressed sequence tag clones and partial PCR amplifications (7Rundlöf A-K. Janard M. Miranda-Vizuete A. Arnér E.S.J. Free Rad. Biol. Med. 2004; 36: 641-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 25Su D. Gladyshev V.N. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 12177-12188Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), we first aimed to analyze the complete size of the v3 transcript and its expression pattern in different human tissues using Northern blot. For this purpose, we used a v3-specific probe containing the first three exons of the Grx domain, which are unique to this variant (Scheme 1, red). This analysis showed a single transcript of ∼4.5 kb size in testis, whereas all other analyzed tissues were negative (Fig. 1A). This size fits very well with the expected size of the β1 transcript, encoding the TrxR1 module plus the N-terminal Grx domain. Next, using specific PCR analyses with first-strand cDNA, we also found v3 transcript in samples from ovary, spleen, heart, liver, kidney, and pancreas in addition to that of testis but could not detect the transcript in thymus, prostate, small intestine, colon, leukocyte, brain, placenta, lung, or skeletal muscle (Fig. 1B). The PCR product obtained corresponded to the expected size of 468 bp (Scheme 1), and its specificity was verified by sequencing of the PCR products from testis and ovary. Given that testis was the tissue with by far the highest amount of v3 mRNA, we set up to analyze the v3 protein expression pattern in testis by using specific polyclonal antibodies raised against the N-terminal Grx domain of v3, encoded by exons β-VIII and β-VI (Scheme 1). Immunohistochemical staining of human testis using these antibodies identified interstitial Leydig cells as the most prominent cell type expressing v3 (Fig. 1C). This should be compared with the staining of Leydig cells, Sertoli cells, and spermatids using a commercial antibody against the TrxR1 module as published by others (see Ref. 13Uhlen M. Bjorling E. Agaton C. Szigyarto C.A. Amini B. Andersen E. Andersson A.C. Angelidou P. Asplund A. Asplund C. Berglund L. Bergstrom K. Brumer H. Cerjan D. Ekstrom M. Elobeid A. Eriksson C. Fagerberg L. Falk R.

Cell Proteomics. 2005; 4: 1920-1932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar and www.proteinatlas.org) (Fig. 1, E and F). We subsequently analyzed the expression of the v3 transcript in human cancer cell lines using the same PCR strategy as described for normal tissue (Scheme 1). Several cancer cell lines were found to express v3, i.e. HCC1937, H23, A549, U1810, and H157 (Fig. 2A). Other cell lines, such as U1285, HeLa, or Jurkat, were negative in the analysis. Interestingly, HeLa cells that normally did not express v3 induced the transcript upon treatment with estradiol or testosterone, whereas other treatment such as serum starvation or hydroxyurea had no obvious effect on the expression (Fig. 2B). Localization of TXNRD1_v3 in Transfected Cells—Human TXNRD1_v2 has been shown to co-localize with the estrogen receptors ERα and ERβ in the nucleus of transfected cells in the presence of ligand (29Damdimopoulos A.E. Miranda-Vizuete A. Treuter E. Gustafsson J.Å. Spyrou G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38721-38729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Because of the effect of estradiol and testosterone on v3 expression (Fig. 2B) and since the last exon of the Grx domain of v3 is shared with a part of TXNRD1_v2 (Scheme 1), we analyzed whether v3 would also co-localize with estrogen receptors in transfected cells. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, we found no evidence of such co-localization in transfected HEK293 cells of v3-GFP fusion proteins with either the ERα (Fig. 3A) or the ERβ (Fig. 3B) nuclear receptors in the presence of ligand. However, performing these experiments, we noted a strikingly dotted appearance of the v3-GFP fusion protein fluorescence (Fig. 3, A and B). We thus analyzed that pattern in further detail, using GFP fusion constructs with the complete v3 protein, the TrxR1 module alone, or the Grx domain of v3 alone, also comparing their respective pattern of localization with that of actin and tubulin. This approach showed that all constructs containing the Grx domain of v3 display a dotted cytosolic appearance as well as membrane-associated fluorescence in the two cell lines used (HEK293 and HeLa) (Fig. 4, A, C, and F). This could not be seen neither with the TrxR1 module alone in fusion with GFP, which showed a more diffuse cytosolic localization (Fig. 4D), nor with only GFP alone, which was used as control and found in both cytosol and nucleus in these cells (Fig. 4, B and E). In a mitotic cell, fluorescence of the GFP-coupled Grx domain of v3 appeared strongly localized to the cell membrane (Fig. 4G). Comparing the localization of the Grx domain of v3 fused to GFP with the staining patterns of actin and tubulin in the same cells, it was clear that the Grx domain of v3 (either when expressed as the complete protein carrying the TrxR1 module or in the form of the isolated Grx domain) closely resembled the staining of actin but without a complete overlap. Comparing the green fluorescence of the v3-derived GFP fusion proteins with the red staining of actin and analyzing the merged figures, it seemed like the green fluorescence was more pronounced at the cell membrane, whereas in the case of the dotted cytosolic staining, the actin-derived staining was more pronounced than the fluorescence of v3, although a clear overlap (yellow in the merged pictures) could be seen (Fig. 4, A, C, F, and G).FIGURE 4Dotted cytosolic and membrane-associated localization pattern of v3 compared with actin and tubulin. The fluorescence microscope pictures show HeLa (A and B) or HEK293 cells (C-G) transfected with either the complete isoform v3 fused to GFP (v3-GFP) or the Grx domain of v3 fused to GFP (v3(Grx)-GFP) and also stained for"
https://openalex.org/W2075986427,"This paper is a response to the increasing difficulty biologists find in agreeing upon a definition of the gene, and indeed, the increasing disarray in which that concept finds itself. After briefly reviewing these problems, we propose an alternative to both the concept and the word gene-an alternative that, like the gene, is intended to capture the essence of inheritance, but which is both richer and more expressive. It is also clearer in its separation of what the organism statically is (what it tangibly inherits) and what it dynamically does (its functionality and behavior). Our proposal of a genetic functor, or genitor, is a sweeping extension of the classical genotype/phenotype paradigm, yet it appears to be faithful to the findings of contemporary biology, encompassing many of the recently emerging-and surprisingly complex-links between structure and functionality."
https://openalex.org/W2079018506,"A classic model of tubulogenesis utilizes Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. MDCK cells form monoclonal cysts in three-dimensional collagen and tubulate in response to hepatocyte growth factor, which activates multiple signaling pathways, including the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. It was shown previously that MAPK activation is necessary and sufficient to induce the first stage of tubulogenesis, the partial epithelial to mesenchymal transition (p-EMT), whereas matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are necessary for the second redifferentiation stage. To identify specific MMP genes, their regulators, tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMPs), and the molecular pathways by which they are activated, we used two distinct MAPK inhibitors and a technique we have termed subtraction pathway microarray analysis. Of the 19 MMPs and 3 TIMPs present on the Canine Genome 2.0 Array, MMP13 and TIMP1 were up-regulated 198- and 169-fold, respectively, via the MAPK pathway. This was confirmed by two-dimensional and three-dimensional real time PCR, as well as in MDCK cells inducible for the MAPK gene Raf. Knockdown of MMP13 using short hairpin RNA prevented progression past the initial phase of p-EMT. Knockdown of TIMP1 prevented normal cystogenesis, although the initial phase of p-EMT did occasionally occur. The MMP13 knockdown phenotype is likely because of decreased collagenase activity, whereas the TIMP1 knockdown phenotype appears due to increased apoptosis. These data suggest a model, which may also be important for development of other branched organs, whereby the MAPK pathway controls both MDCK p-EMT and redifferentiation, in part by activating MMP13 and TIMP1.

Although tubulogenesis is incompletely understood, genes involved in this process are conserved in different organs, and indeed throughout evolution (8Lipschutz J.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2007; 293: F985-F986Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Of all mammalian organs, kidney development is probably the best understood (9Ekblom P. Seldin D.W. Giesbach G.

Fuller S.D. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1985; 1: 243-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). When MDCK cells are seeded singly within a three-dimensional collagen matrix, over 10 days they form monoclonal structures that are characterized by a polarized epithelium surrounding a fluid-filled space, apical microvilli, a solitary cilium, and apical tight junctions (15McAteer J.A. Dougherty G.S. Gardner Jr., K.D. Evan A.P. Scanning Electron Microsc. 1986; : 1135-1150PubMed Google Scholar, 16McAteer J.A. Evan A.P. Gardner K.D. Anat. Rec. 1987; 217: 229-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), meeting the most rigorous definition of “cysts” (17McAteer J.A. Dougherty G.S. Gardner Jr., K.D. Evan A.P. Scanning Microsc. 1988; 2: 1739-1763PubMed Google Scholar). Exposure of preformed MDCK cysts to HGF causes the cysts to develop branching tubules (18Montesano R. Schaller G. Orci L. Cell. 1991; 66: 697-711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar) in a process that resembles renal branching morphogenesis in vivo (11Saxen L. Organogenesis of the Kidney. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1987: 1-181Crossref Google Scholar).Detailed studies using MDCK cells grown in a collagen matrix until the cyst stage and induced with HGF showed that tubulogenesis consists of the following two morphologically defined stages: an initiation stage, termed partial epithelial-mesenchymal transition (p-EMT) that occurs in the first 24 h following HGF induction, and subsequent redifferentiation that proceeds over the next 48-72 h (5Pollack A.L. Runyan R.B. Mostov K.E. Dev. Biol. 1998; 204: 64-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 7O'Brien L.E. Tang K. Kats E.S. Schutz-Geschwender A. Lipschutz J.H. Mostov K.E. Dev.

Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). In morphologic terms, the p-EMT stage involves the formation of actin extensions and chains of cells, which have lost their polarity, extending off the basolateral surface of the cysts, whereas redifferentiation involves the generation of tubular lumens and the re-emergence of epithelial cell polarity (5Pollack A.L. Runyan R.B. Mostov K.E. Dev. Biol. 1998; 204: 64-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). HGF (also known as scatter factor) is mitogenic, motogenic, and morphogenic, and binding of HGF to its CMET tyrosine kinase receptor, which is located on the basolateral surface of MDCK cells (19Crepaldi T. Pollack A.L. Prat M. Zborek A. Mostov K. Comoglio P.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), activates a multitude of signaling pathways, including phosphoinositide 3-kinase, phospholipase C, protein-tyrosine phosphatase 2, cytosolic phospholipase A2, and MAPK/ERK to name a few (as reviewed in Ref. 20Balkovetz D.F. Lipschutz J.H. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1999; 186: 225-260Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).We and our colleagues previously showed that the MAPK pathway of Raf-MEK-ERK is both necessary and sufficient to initiate p-EMT, whereas matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are necessary for the redifferentiation stage of MDCK tubulogenesis (7O'Brien L.E.

MMPs are zinc-containing endopeptidases that are involved in remodeling the extracellular matrix and are crucial for organ development. Tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMPs) are endogenous specific inhibitors of MMPs that bind the active site of the MMP catalytic domain. To date, 28 MMPs and 4 TIMPs have been identified in vertebrates (22Catania J.M. Chen G. Parrish A.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2007; 292: F905-F911Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar).Here we used subtraction pathway microarray analysis to identify specific candidate MMP “tubulogenes,” their TIMP regulators, and the molecular pathways by which they were activated. The resulting candidate tubulogenes genes were then knocked down in MDCK cells using short hairpin RNA (shRNA), and the phenotype and mechanism of action were studied during HGF-induced tubulogenesis.MATERIALS AND METHODSMDCK Culture, HGF/4-HT Treatment, and RNA Isolation–Low passage type II MDCK cells were obtained from K.

These cells were originally cloned by Daniel Louvard at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) and came to Keith Mostov via Karl Matlin. Cells were cultured in modified Eagle's minimum essential medium containing Earle's balanced salt solution and glutamine supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. MDCK cells were seeded at confluency on 24-mm Transwell filter units coated with collagen (Costar, Cambridge, MA). Pore size on all filters was 0.4 μm. Cell monolayers were used for experiments after 6-7 days of culture with daily changes in medium. Recombinant HGF at 100 ng/ml was added to the basolateral compartment of MDCK cell monolayers following a 1-h pretreatment either with or without U0126 (UO) (Promega) or PD098059 (PD) (Sigma), both inhibitors of MEK, at 10 and 50 μm, respectively.MDCK shRNA-expressing cell lines and controls were plated out in a three-dimensional type I collagen matrix as described previously (21Hellman N.E. Greco A.J. Rogers K.K. Kanchagar C. Balkovetz D.F. Lipschutz J.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: F777-F785Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and allowed to mature into hollow cystic structures over the course of 2 weeks. Cysts were then stimulated either in the presence or absence of hepatocyte growth factor at a concentration of either 100 ng/ml for 24 h or a concentration of 30 ng/ml for 4 days, and the HGF-containing media were changed daily. MDCK cell cysts subjected to HGF at 100 ng/ml for 24 h have been shown to induce p-EMT, the initial stage of tubulogenesis, in virtually 100% of MDCK cell cysts (6Lipschutz J.H. Guo W. O'Brien L.E. Nguyen Y.H. Novick P. Mostov K.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4259-4275Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 21Hellman N.E. Greco A.J. Rogers K.K. Kanchagar C. Balkovetz D.F. Lipschutz J.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: F777-F785Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar); however, the same concentration applied to MDCK cells for 4 days was observed to result in cell scatter. Therefore, a lower concentration of HGF (30 ng/ml) was chosen, which, when added for 4 days, was observed to result in mature tubule formation in some cysts. Recombinant human HGF was very generously provided by the late R. Schwall (Genentech, South San Francisco).Type II MDCK cells containing inducible Raf fused to the estrogen receptor (25Hansen S.H. Zegers M.M. Woodrow M. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Chardin P. Mostov K.E. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9364-9375Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) were grown on two-dimensional Transwell filters as described above. In these cells, the kinase activity of Raf was induced using an estrogen analog, 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-HT) (Sigma), at a concentration of 1 μm as described previously (25Hansen S.H. Zegers M.M. Woodrow M. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Chardin P. Mostov K.E. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9364-9375Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 26Liu Z. Greco A.J. Hellman N.E. Spector J. Robinson J. Tang O.T. Lipschutz J.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 353: 793-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar).Total RNA was obtained from MDCK cell monolayers using the RNeasy Mini Protocol (Qiagen) for the isolation of total RNA from animal cells. For the microarray studies, RNA samples were visualized by agarose RNA electrophoresis. RNA concentration and purity were measured by determining the 260 nm/280 nm ratio. All ratios were greater than 1.8.Microarray Analysis–For our experiments, all protocols were conducted as described in the Affymetrix GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual. All conditions were performed in quadruplicate except where otherwise stated. Fifteen μg of total RNA, collected from MDCK cells grown for 6 days on Transwell filters and exposed to 0 or 24 h of HGF, with and without UO126 or PD09859, were converted to first-strand cDNA. Second-strand cDNA synthesis was followed by in vitro transcription for linear amplification of each transcript and incorporation of biotinylated CTP and UTP. The cRNA products were fragmented to 200 nucleotides or less, heated at 99 °C for 5 min, and hybridized for 16 h at 45 °C to the GeneChip® Canine Genome 2.0 Array (Affymetrix Inc), containing 42,860 Canis familiaris probe sets for >20,000 predicted genes.The GeneChip® Canine Genome 2.0 Array chips were then washed at low and high stringency and stained with streptavidin-phycoerythrin. Fluorescence was amplified by adding biotinylated anti-streptavidin and an additional aliquot of streptavidin-phycoerythrin stain. A confocal scanner was used to collect fluorescence signal at 3 nm resolution after excitation at 570 nm. The average signal from two sequential scans was calculated for each microarray feature. A complete microarray expression data set has been submitted to the National Center for Biotechnology Information's (NCBI) Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) data base (GEO Submission GSE9435, NCBI tracking system 15360129).Affymetrix GeneChip Operating System (GCOS, version 1.4) was used to quantitate the expression levels for the genes represented on the GeneChip® Canine Genome 2.0 Array; default values provided by Affymetrix were applied to all analysis parameters. Border pixels were removed, and the average intensity of pixels within the 75th percentile was computed for each probe. The average of the lowest 2% of probe intensities occurring in each of 16 microarray sectors was set as background and subtracted from all features in that sector. Probe pairs were scored positive or negative for detection of a specific gene sequence by comparing signals from the perfect match and mismatch probe features. The number of probe pairs meeting the default discrimination threshold (τ = 0.015) was used to assign a call of absent (A), present (P), or marginal (M) for each assayed gene, and a p value was calculated to reflect confidence in the detection determination. One of the samples, HGF + UO, was observed to have been degraded during processing and was therefore excluded from subsequent analyses.Affymetrix cell files, containing probe intensities, were imported into GeneSpring (version 7.3, Agilent Technologies) where GC-robust multiarray average was applied to calculate probe set signal levels. The GCOS-generated present/absent/marginal determinations for each probe set on each GeneChip® Canine Genome 2.0 Array chip were imported as well. To assess global inter-sample relationships, we exported the data for all genes that were present in at least 3 of the 15 samples and performed hierarchical clustering using GeneSpring.We were interested in identifying differentially regulated genes in three basic comparisons, HGF alone versus control (standard medium), HGF + UO versus HGF alone, and HGF + PD versus HGF alone. For each comparison, all genes on the array were first filtered to retain those that were present in all replicates of at least one of the conditions. The filtered lists were then exported to Microsoft Excel, where Significance Analysis of Microarrays (version 2.21, Stanford University) was applied in a two-class unpaired mode, with 500 permutations to identify differentially regulated genes with a ≥2-fold change and a false discovery rate of <0.01%. These three gene lists were each then subdivided to include a group of genes that were up-regulated and a group of genes that were down-regulated, yielding six lists as follows: HGF > control, HGF < control, HGF + PD > HGF, HGF + PD < HGF, HGF + UO > HGF, and HGF + UO < HGF.Real Time PCR–Fifteen μg of total RNA, collected from MDCK cells grown for 6 days on Transwell filters and exposed to 0 or 24 h of HGF ± UO126 or PD09859, were converted to first-strand cDNA. cDNA and the TaqMan primer/probe system, individualized for each mRNA, were used in conjunction with the 7700 PRISM sequence detection instrument (both Applied Biosystems) as described in the Applied Biosystems technical manual. When the reaction product amplification exceeded the threshold value, the corresponding cycle number was termed CT. Fold change between conditions was calculated through an exponential function of the observed difference in CT as described previously (27Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods (San Diego). 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (119422) Google Scholar). The values were normalized to a control mRNA, the 18S ribosome, and all real time PCR studies were performed at least three times in triplicate.Western Blotting–Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (28Lipschutz J.H. Lingappa V.R. Mostov K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20954-20960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). For caspase 3 analysis, filters were probed with rabbit anti-cleaved caspase 3 at a concentration of 1:1000 (Asp-175; Cell Signal Technology, Danvers, MA). This antibody recognizes active caspase 3 and is a marker for apoptosis (29Yu W. Fang X. Ewald A. Wong K. Hunt C.A. Werb Z. Matthay M.A. Mostov K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 1693-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Filters were then probed with horseradish peroxidase-labeled donkey anti-rabbit antibody at 1:5000 dilution. Filters were developed using SuperSignal West Femto maximum sensitivity substrate kit (Pierce) and visualized on Kodak X-Omat film (Eastman Kodak Co.).Creation of shRNA Vectors–The lentiviral vector psicoR (30Ventura A. Meissner A. Dillon C.P. McManus M. Sharp P.A. Van Parijs L. Jaenisch R. Jacks T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10380-10385Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar) was used to generate all shRNA-containing vectors in this paper. The software program Psicoligomaker was used to select 19-mer shRNA sequences against both canine MMP13 and TIMP1 genes. The sequence selected for MMP13 shRNA knockdown was 5′-GACTCATTCTGAAGTTGAA-3′ (located in exon 3), and the primers used to generate this sequence were MMP13shFwd (5′-TGACTCATTCTGAAGTTGAATTCAAGAGATTCAACTTCAGAATGAGTCTTTTTTC-3′) and MMP13shRev (5′-TCGAGAAAAAAGACTCATTCTGAAGTTGAATCTCTTGAATTCAACTTCAGAATGAGTCA-3′). The sequence selected for TIMP1 shRNA was 5′-GTTCATCCATCCCCTGCAA-3′ (located in exon 6), and the primers used to generate this sequence were TIMP1shFwd (5′-TGTTCATCCATCCCCTGCAATTCAAGAGATTGCAGGGGATGGATGAACTTTTTTC-3′) and TIMP1shRev (5′-TCGAGAAAAAAGTTCATCCATCCCCTGCAATCTCTTGAATTGCAGGGGATGGATGAACA-3′). The sequence of the scrambled shRNA used as a control was 5′-GTCAAGTCTCACTTGCGTC-3′ and the primers used to generate this sequence were scrFwd1 (5′-TGTCAAGTCTCACTTGCGTCTTCAAGAGAGACGCAAGTGAGACTTGACTTTTTTC-3′) and scrRev1 (5′-TCGAGAAAAAAGTCAAGTCTCACTTGCGTCTCTCTTGAAGACGCAAGTGAGACTTGACA-3′). Annealed, phosphorylated oligonucleotides were then ligated into HpaI/XhoI-cut psicoR vector, and clones with the appropriate size insert were selected for sequence analysis. One clone of each plasmid with the correct sequence was chosen and DNA prepared using a maxi-prep DNA kit (Qiagen).To confirm the specificity of the shRNA knockdown, a second shRNA was created using the pPRIME system, which was generously supplied by the Elledge laboratory (31Stegmeier F. Hu G. Rickles R.J. Hannon G.J. Elledge S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13212-13217Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). The shRNA sequence was designed by pasting the TIMP1 canine mRNA sequence (GenBank™ accession number AY534616) into the program found at the RNAi Central website. The 22-mer shRNA sequence beginning at position 89, TGGAGAGCGTCTGCGGATACTT, was cloned into the p199 vector and then into a lentiviral delivery system for infection into MDCK T23 cells, followed by FACS sorting as described above.Creation of MDCK shRNA Cell Lines–To prepare lentivirus-containing media, early passage HEK293T cells (ATCC) were transfected according to the calcium phosphate precipitation method with 12 μg of the shRNA-containing vector (either psi-coR-MMP13sh, psicoR-TIMP1sh, psicoR-scr, or psicoR vector alone) along with 6 μg each of the packaging vectors pVSVG, pMDL, and pREV. After 48 h, 45 ml of lentivirus-containing media were harvested and concentrated in an ultracentrifuge at 16,000 × g at 4 °C for 2.5 h. The viral pellet was resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline and used to infect MDCK strain II or MDCK T23 cells plated at a concentration of 5 × 105 at a multiplicity of infection of 10-20. Efficiency of infection was determined by assessing GFP fluorescence using FACS analysis (FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences).Cre Rescue–MDCK cells expressing MMP13 and TIMP1 knockdown shRNA were grown to 60% confluency and exposed to standard minimum essential medium containing 10 μl of adenovirus expressing Cre recombinase (Vector Laboratories). The concentration of adenovirus corresponded to a multiplicity of infection of 200. The Cre-containing medium was left on the cells for 6 h at 37 °C and then replaced with fresh medium. Excision of the loxp-flanked shRNA-containing vector was confirmed by loss of GFP expression.Immunofluorescence–Collagen disks from HGF-treated and -untreated cells were harvested and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min followed by quenching in 50 mm NH4Cl for 10 min as described previously (21Hellman N.E. Greco A.J. Rogers K.K. Kanchagar C. Balkovetz D.F. Lipschutz J.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: F777-F785Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Cysts were permeabilized in 1% Triton X-100 for 15 min, treated with Hoechst nuclear stain (Sigma) for 10 min when indicated, and then treated with either phalloidin-rhodamine (Sigma) or primary antibody against caspase 3 at a concentration of 1:250 (Asp-175; Cell Signal Technology, Danvers, MA). Secondary antibody (e.g. donkey anti-rabbit Cy3 at a concentration of 1:600) was used when indicated. Collagen disks were mounted with Fluoprep (Biomérieux, France) and visualized using a fluorescent microscope (Leica DMR) or a confocal microscope (Leica TCS SL).RESULTSIdentification of Genes Regulated by HGF as Determined by Microarray Analysis–HGF-induced tubulogenesis in MDCK cells is a complex process requiring the coordination of diverse cellular processes such as proliferation, cytoskeletal rearrangement, motility, differentiation, and extracellular matrix secretion (32Zegers M.M. O'Brien L.E. Yu W. Datta A. Mostov K.E. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 169-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Given that we and our colleagues previously showed, using broad inhibitors of the entire MMP family, that MMPs are necessary for the redifferentiation stage of tubulogenesis (7O'Brien L.E. Tang K. Kats E.S. Schutz-Geschwender A. Lipschutz J.H. Mostov K.E. Dev. Cell. 2004; 7: 21-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), we set out here to identify specific candidate MMP and TIMP genes regulated by HGF and their pathway of activation. Because of the large number of MMPs and TIMPs described to date (22Catania J.M. Chen G. Parrish A.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2007; 292: F905-F911Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), we decided to use nonbiased DNA microarray analysis as our initial screen. The recently released Canine Genome 2.0 Array (Affymetrix) contains 19 MMPs and 3 TIMPs (Fig. 1A), and importantly, all the MMPs and TIMPs that have been reported to be expressed in the kidney are found on the Canine Genome 2.0 Array (Fig. 1B). Our screen was accomplished by first determining the total set of genes regulated by HGF and then, because the MAPK/ERK pathway has been shown to play a central role in HGF-induced tubulogenesis, subtracting out the subset of genes that were still regulated by HGF in the presence of either of two distinct inhibitors of the MAPK/ERK pathway, UO and PD, both of which act by preventing phosphorylation of MEK.For these experiments, MDCK type II cells were grown on a Transwell filter coated with collagen for 6 days and treated according to one of four conditions as follows: exposure to recombinant HGF, to HGF + UO, to HGF + PD, or to standard medium (control). For each condition, performed in quadruplicate, the MDCK cells were exposed to the indicated treatment for a 24-h period, which corresponds to the completion of the p-EMT stage and the beginning of the redifferentiation stage of tubulogenesis. Therefore, all RNA necessary to initiate the redifferentiation stage of tubulogenesis should be present. RNA was harvested from the MDCK cells treated under each condition and then converted to cDNA, which was used to query the C. familiaris genes on the GeneChip® Canine Genome 2.0 Array. The details of how we performed the analysis can be found under “Materials and Methods.” We initially evaluated the list of genes that were differentially regulated by hierarchically clustering all genes that were present in at least 3 of the 15 individual samples (one sample in the HGF + UO set was lost during processing).The resulting dendrogram shown at the top of Fig. 2A indicates that the replicates are very similar for each condition (exposure to recombinant HGF, to HGF + UO, to HGF + PD, or to standard medium) and, furthermore, that gene expression in the HGF + UO condition is similar to gene expression in the HGF + PD condition. The color in Fig. 2A depicts ratios of the expression of a gene in a single sample to the median of expression of that same gene across all the samples.FIGURE 2Subtraction pathway microarray analysis of gene regulation induced by HGF via the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. A, dendrogram illustrating the clustering of all four replicates for each condition as follows: HGF alone, HGF + PD, HGF + UO, and control (standard culture medium). The fact that all four replicates in each condition cluster thus validates the similarity of the replicates. The columns represent the genes, ordered in rows across the columns, that were differentially regulated. The different colors refer to levels of regulation with blue"
https://openalex.org/W2006977511,"Tgs1 is the hypermethylase responsible for m3G cap formation of U small nuclear RNAs (U snRNAs) and small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs). In vertebrates, hypermethylation of snRNAs occurs in the cytoplasm, whereas this process takes place in the nucleus for snoRNAs. Accordingly, the hypermethylase is found in both compartments with a diffuse localization in the cytoplasm and a concentration in Cajal bodies in the nucleoplasm. In this study, we report that the Tgs1 hypermethylase exists as two species, a full-length cytoplasmic isoform and a shorter nuclear isoform of 65–70 kDa. The short isoform exhibits methyltransferase activity and associates with components of box C/D and H/ACA snoRNPs, pointing to a role of this isoform in hypermethylation of snoRNAs. We also show that production of the short Tgs1 isoform is inhibited by MG132, suggesting that it results from proteasomal limited processing of the full-length Tgs1 protein. Together, our results suggest that proteasome maturation constitutes a mechanism regulating Tgs1 function by generating Tgs1 species with different substrate specificities, subcellular localizations, and functions.

Based on their intracellular location and function, these RNPs can be classified in two groups, the nucleoplasmic small nuclear RNPs (snRNPs) that play a role in the maturation of pre-mRNAs and the small nucleolar RNPs (snoRNPs) that reside in the cell nucleolus and are required for maturation of pre-rRNA (1Bertrand E. Bordonne R. Prog. Mol. Subcell. Biol. 2004; 35: 79-97Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Each spliceosomal snRNP is composed of an snRNA (U1, U2, U4, or U5) complexed with a set of common (or core) proteins, also called Sm proteins (B-B′ in mammals, D1, D2, D3, E, F, and G) (2Will C.L. Lührmann R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 290-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). In contrast, snoRNAs associate with distinct sets of evolutionarily conserved proteins: box C/D snoRNAs are bound by fibrillarin, Nop56p, Nop58p, and 15.5p, whereas box H/ACA snoRNAs associate with dyskerin (Cbf5 in yeast), Nhp2p, Gar1p, and Nop10p (3Kiss T. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5949-5951Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Formation of a complete core complex is required for accumulation/stabilization of snoRNAs as well as for correct nucleolar localization of snoRNPs (3Kiss T. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5949-5951Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar).The snRNP and snoRNP particles differ not only in their composition but also in their biogenesis, since production of mature spliceosomal snRNPs requires a cytoplasmic phase, whereas formation of snoRNPs is exclusively a nuclear process (4Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1986; 46: 905-911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 5Terns M.P. Dahlberg J.E. Science. 1994; 264: 959-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Despite these differences, snRNPs and snoRNPs share common features. For example, yeast snRNA and snoRNA precursors are stabilized by the La proteins, and they utilize common processing factors, such as the RNase III orthologues Rnt1 and the exosome for 3′-end maturation (6Chanfreau G. Legrain P. Jacquier A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 975-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 7Kufel J. Allmang C. Chanfreau G. Petfalski E. Lafontaine D.L. Tollervey D. Mol. Cell.

Moreover, assembly of vertebrate snRNPs and snoRNPs depends on the SMN protein, the product of the survival of motor neuron gene (12Terns M.P. Terns R.M. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R862-R864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Finally, both in yeast and in mammals, snRNAs and a number of snoRNAs are substrates for the Tgs1 hypermethylase involved in the conversion of the m7G cap to a 2,2,7-trimethylguanosine structure (13Mouaikel J. Verheggen C. Bertrand E. Tazi J. Bordonne R. Mol Cell. 2002; 9: 891-901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 14Hausmann S. Shuman S. J. Biol.

Cell. 2006; 17: 3221-3231Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar).The fact that a unique enzyme is responsible for m3G cap formation of snRNAs and snoRNAs, which are associated with different sets of common proteins, raises the question of how Tgs1 recognizes these various RNPs. By analogy with the snRNPs, where Tgs1 associates with basic domains found in the C-terminal extensions of Sm proteins, it has been proposed that the enzyme also interacts with basic rich domains of the common proteins of the snoRNPs (13Mouaikel J. Verheggen C. Bertrand E. Tazi J. Bordonne R. Mol Cell. 2002; 9: 891-901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, common snoRNP proteins Nop58p, Nop56p, Cbf5p, and Gar1p possess highly charged domains with numerous K and R residues (16Gautier T. Berges T. Tollervey D. Hurt E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7088-7098Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), and it has been shown that the C-terminal basic rich extensions of Nop58p and Cbf5p strongly interact with Tgs1 in yeast (13Mouaikel J. Verheggen C. Bertrand E. Tazi J. Bordonne R. Mol Cell. 2002; 9: 891-901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar).We previously reported that, in HeLa cells, the human Tgs1 hypermethylase locates diffusely in the cytoplasm (17Mouaikel J. Narayanan U. Verheggen C. Matera A.G. Bertrand E. Tazi J. Bordonne R. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 616-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), in agreement with former data showing that hypermethylation of vertebrate snRNAs is a cytoplasmic event (2Will C.L. Lührmann R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 290-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). It also locates in the nucleus, where it concentrates in Cajal bodies (17Mouaikel J. Narayanan U. Verheggen C. Matera A.G. Bertrand E. Tazi J. Bordonne R. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 616-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 18Verheggen C. Lafontaine D.L. Samarsky D. Mouaikel J. Blanchard J.M. Bordonne R. Bertrand E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2736-2745Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Given that snoRNAs transit through Cajal bodies during their biogenesis, it is possible that hypermethylation of snoRNAs occurs in these structures, but this has never been directly shown. Moreover, the manner via which nuclear Tgs1 discriminates between snRNAs and snoRNAs remains to be determined, given that both RNA species transit through Cajal bodies during their biogenesis (19Cioce M. Lamond A.I. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 105-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). In the process of investigating the function of Tgs1 in vivo using an RNA interference approach, we discovered that two isoforms of Tgs1 exist in HeLa cells and that these isoforms are differentially distributed; the full-length isoform with an apparent molecular mass of 110 kDa is located in the cytoplasm, whereas the shorter 65–70-kDa isoform is located in the nuclear compartment. We also show that the short isoform lacks the N-terminal region of Tgs1, retains methyltransferase activity, and binds preferentially to common proteins of C/D and H/ACA snoRNPs, consistent with a role in snoRNA hypermethylation. Finally, we report that inhibitors of the proteasome block production of the small Tgs1 isoform, suggesting a role for the proteasomal machinery in its maturation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid Constructions—The plasmid expressing the Tgs1-TAP fusion protein was constructed using the pZOME-N vector placed into the Gateway system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The bicistronic plasmid pCRTgs1 was constructed by tripartite ligation of a Tgs1-encoding fragment (nucleotides 1–903) generated by PCR amplification using oligonucleotides carrying BamHI (5′ site) and NcoI (3′ site) restriction sites with the BamHI-XhoI (4.1 kb) and XhoI-NcoI (2 kb) of the pCREL vector (20Vagner S.

To place the Tgs1 gene under a T7 promoter (plasmid pB-Tgs1), a BamHI-XhoI fragment carrying the Tgs1 gene was obtained by PCR amplification and cloned at corresponding restriction sites into the pBluescript vector (Stratagene).Plasmids carrying genes (FibNter, Nop56Cter, 15.5, and Nhp2) under the T7 promoter were constructed using the Gateway system. The pBST-dyskerin construct carrying the dyskerin gene in the pKS(-) background was a gift from B. Jady (Toulouse).To obtain the pGST-Tgs1Nter plasmid (encoding amino acids 1–475 of Tgs1), a BamH1-HindIII fragment (blunt-ended by Klenow treatment at the HindIII site) was isolated and cloned into the pGST-4T3 vector (Amersham Biosciences) digested with BamHI and SmaI. To obtain the pGST-Tgs1Cter construct (encoding from amino acid 477 to the end of Tgs1), a HindIII-XhoI fragment (blunt-ended by Klenow treatment at the HindIII site) was isolated and cloned at the SmaI and XhoI restriction sites into the pGST-4T3 vector.The plasmids expressing the GST-sTgs1 and GFP-sTgs1 (amino acids 380–end) fusion proteins were constructed using the Gateway system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen).Production of Anti-Tgs1 Antibodies—The Tgs1 polyclonal antibodies were generated in rabbits (Eurogentec, Belgium) by injecting two peptides corresponding to amino acids 656–670 and 839–852 of the Tgs1 sequence (Fig. 3C). Tgs1-specific antibodies were affinity-purified using glutathione S-transferase (Amersham Biosciences) beads cross-linked to a GST-Tg1 fusion protein carrying the C-terminal region (577–end) of Tgs1 as described (21Bharti A.K. Olson M.O. Kufe D.W. Rubin E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1993-1997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 ml of rabbit serum adjusted to pH 8.2 were applied to the column overnight at 4 °C. After washing the column, antibodies were eluted with 0.2 m glycine buffer (pH 2.5). The protein concentration was determined at 280 nm using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Fractions containing the antibodies were dialyzed against PBS containing 50% glycerol and stored at -20 °C.Cell Culture, Transfection, RNA Interference, and Luciferase Assays—HeLa cells were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate co-precipitation procedure as described previously (18Verheggen C. Lafontaine D.L. Samarsky D. Mouaikel J. Blanchard J.M. Bordonne R. Bertrand E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2736-2745Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The precipitates were left overnight on the cells and removed by solubilization in an isotonic solution without calcium and phosphate, and cells were then split.Target-specific siRNA duplexes were designed as described by the manufacturer (Eurogentec), and selected siRNA sequences corresponding to region 788–808 of the Tgs1 mRNA sequence were generated. Control siRNAs were generated against the sequence of the firefly luciferase. Cells were transfected with the siRNA duplexes using Oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol.For luciferase assays, HeLa cells were seeded on 12-well plates at a density of 150,000 cells/well. The next day, plasmids (1 μg/well) were transfected using FuGene 6 (Roche Applied Science) following the supplier's instructions. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h before analysis. The luciferase activities were measured using the Dual Glo Luciferase kit (Promega) and a microplate luminometer (EG and G, Berthold).Extract Preparation, Subcellular Fractionation, and Western Blot Analysis—For preparation of whole cell extracts, HeLa cells were harvested in HNTG buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease inhibitor mixture) and lysed on ice for 20 min. After centrifugation at 15,000 × g (10 min, 4 °C), supernatants were carefully removed and used for Western analysis or immunoprecipitation experiments.For proteasome inhibition, cells were treated for 8 h with 20 μm MG132 (10.5 mm stock in Me2SO) (Biomol International) diluted in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Culture medium was then supplemented with 25 μm MG132 for 10–12 h for a total incubation time of 18–20 h.For cell fractionation, HeLa cells were harvested by trypsinization and washed twice with ice-cold PBS. Cells were resuspended at about 5 × 106/ml in HMKE buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.2), 10 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 250 mm sucrose) containing protease inhibitor mixture (complete EDTA-free; Roche Applied Science), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm), and digitonin (200 μg/ml). Cells were left on ice for 10 min and then centrifuged at 500 × g 10 min at 4 °C to separate cytosol from membranes, nuclei, organelles, and cytoskeleton. The supernatant (cytosol) was carefully removed, and the pellet was washed in HMKE buffer without digitonin. To perform nuclear protein extraction, the pellet was solubilized in extraction buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 9, 0.1 m NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitor mixture) for 20 min on ice. Samples were then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was carefully removed (nuclear fraction).For Western blot analysis, the protein content of the fractions was determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) and equal amounts of protein from each lysate were analyzed. Samples were boiled in SDS-sample buffer and analyzed on an SDS-8% polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were blotted on a Protran nitrocellulose membrane and incubated with purified anti-Tgs1 antibodies (diluted 1:400), followed by anti-rabbit secondary antibody. Detection was carried out by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). Anti-TATA-binding protein antibodies reacting against the nuclear TATA-binding protein were used at a 1:5000 dilution and were purchased from Eurogentec. Anti-PAP antibodies (P1291; Sigma) were used at a 1:2000 dilution.Production of Recombinant Proteins and Methyltransferase and in Vitro Binding Assays—Plasmids encoding pGST fusion proteins were transformed in Escherichia coli and induced by the addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and recombinant proteins were purified as described (22Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5035) Google Scholar). A methyltransferase assay was performed as described (14Hausmann S. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4021-4024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) in 20-μl reaction mixtures containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm dithiothreitol, 3 μm [3H-CH3]AdoMet, 5 mm m7GTP, and 2 μg GST-sTgs1 fusion protein. GST (2 μg) was used as a negative control. After incubation for 60 min at 37 °C, the reaction mixture was spotted onto DEAE-cellulose filters, and unincorporated [3H-CH3]AdoMet was removed by washing the filters four times with 20 mm ammonium bicarbonate and twice with ethanol/ether (1:1). The filters were then dried and counted in scintillation fluid.In vitro transcription-translation reactions with bacterial S30 or reticulocyte lysates were performed in the presence of [35S]methionine according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). For in vitro protein/protein interaction studies, 1 μg of purified GST fusion proteins (or GST alone as a negative control) were incubated with 10 μl of glutathione-agarose and 20 μl of in vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled proteins in 200 μl of final binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40). After a 30-min incubation at 25 °C followed by a 30-min incubation at 4 °C with constant rotation, beads were pelleted and washed five times with 1 ml of binding buffer. Bound proteins were fractionated on SDS-polyacrylamide, and the gel was then dried and analyzed by fluorography.Reverse Transcription-PCR, Immunoprecipitation Experiments, and Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from HeLa cells using TRI-Reagent (Sigma), and cDNA was synthesized with the First Strand cDNA kit (Amersham Biosciences) using the Tgs1-specific reverse primer covering the 3′-stop codon (5′-CCTCGCACTGCTGCATAGTTAG-3′). PCR amplification was performed using the forward primer (5′-ATGTGCTGCGAGAAGTGGAGC3′) and the reverse primer. PCR products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by ethidium bromide staining.For the immunoprecipitations, antibodies were coupled to 40 μl of protein A-Sepharose (0.1 g/ml; Amersham Biosciences) in 500 μl of buffer HNTG (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease inhibitor mixture) for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times with 1 ml of buffer, added to 500 μg to 1 mg of extract, adjusted up to 750 μl with HNTG buffer, and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with constant stirring. The beads were then washed four times with 1 ml of buffer and resuspended in loading buffer. Immunoprecipitation of the Tgs1-TAP fusion proteins was performed using 20 μl of IgG-agarose beads (Sigma). For Northern blot analysis, total RNA was separated by agarose-formaldehyde gel electrophoresis and analyzed following standard protocols (23Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1997: 491-498Google Scholar).Immunocytochemistry and Immunofluorescence—Immunofluorescence was performed on cells grown on coverslips, washed twice in PBS, and fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature, followed by permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min at room temperature. Antibodies against fibrillarin were described previously (18Verheggen C. Lafontaine D.L. Samarsky D. Mouaikel J. Blanchard J.M. Bordonne R. Bertrand E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2736-2745Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). p80 coilin was detected with a polyclonal rabbit anti-coilin (1:400 dilution). Anti-Tgs1 antibodies were used at a 1:200 dilution. Incubations were for 1 h at 25 °C in PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin, and slides were then washed three times for 3 min in PBS. Secondary antibodies were diluted according to the supplier's instructions. Coverslips were mounted on glass slides using mounting medium (Vectashield), and samples were observed using a Leica fluorescence microscope. Images were acquired with a Coolsnap camera (Photometrics) controlled by the Metamorph software (Universal Imaging).RESULTSTwo Tgs1 Isoforms Are Expressed in HeLa Cells—We previously reported that polyclonal rabbit antibodies raised against a mixture of two peptides located in the C-terminal domain (amino acids 656–670 and 839–852) of the human Tgs1 hypermethylase allow the detection of the endogenous Tgs1 protein by immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis (17Mouaikel J. Narayanan U. Verheggen C. Matera A.G. Bertrand E. Tazi J. Bordonne R. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 616-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 18Verheggen C. Lafontaine D.L. Samarsky D. Mouaikel J. Blanchard J.M. Bordonne R. Bertrand E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2736-2745Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, the full-length Tgs1 protein (flTgs1) migrates approximately as a 110-kDa polypeptide rather than at 96 kDa as predicted by its sequence, and this might be due to post-translational modifications or to its amino acid composition. For reasons of clarity, we will use this 110 kDa size to refer to the full-length Tgs1 polypeptide throughout. In addition to the flTgs1 band, we also detected additional faster migrating bands with estimated sizes of ∼65–70 and 55 kDa. We previously assumed that these latter bands corresponded to nonspecific binders of the anti-Tgs1 antibodies. However, during our studies on Tgs1 depletion by RNA interference, a closer examination of the origin of these bands by Western analyses of total extracts revealed that the levels of flTgs1 (110 kDa) and sTgs1 (65–70 kDa) proteins are concomitantly decreased by a unique siRNA duplex covering region 788–808 of the Tgs1 sequence (Fig. 1B). In contrast, the level of the lower unknown bands around 55 kDa was not affected using this RNA interference duplex, suggesting that these bands result from cross-reactivity of the Tgs1 antibodies with other human proteins. In this regard, one of the immunizing peptides covers amino acids 656–670 located in the Tgs1 region encompassing conserved methyltransferase motifs. The unknown proteins at 55 kDa might therefore correspond to nonspecific binders containing methyltransferase motifs. That these proteins are unrelated to Tgs1 is also consistent with the fact that they were not generated when a Tgs1-TAP fusion was expressed in HeLa cells (Fig. 3A), and they were not immunoprecipitated with anti-fibrillarin antibodies (Fig. 5A) (see below).FIGURE 1Two Tgs1 isoforms are found in HeLa cells. A, whole cell extract was prepared from HeLa cells, and 100 μg were subjected to SDS-PAGE with subsequent Western blot analysis using anti-Tgs1 antibodies. A ladder for protein mass standards is shown in lane M. B, an siRNA duplex decreases levels of the 110- and 65–70-kDa Tgs1 isoforms. After transfection of HeLa cells with an siRNA duplex against Tgs1 (Rnai) or against luciferase (Ctrl) for the indicated times, extracts were prepared and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-Tgs1 antibodies. unknown, cross-reacting polypeptides (see “Results”). C, nuclear (Nuc) and cytoplasmic (Cyto) extracts were prepared from HeLa cells and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-Tgs1 antibodies.

D, Western blot using cell extracts prepared under denaturing conditions. Cells were lysed directly in 400 μl of Laemmli buffer, and one-tenth were subjected to SDS-PAGE electrophoresis followed by Western blot analysis using anti-Tgs1 antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 5The small Tgs1 isoform binds to snoRNP components. A, immunoprecipitation of fibrillarin with sTgs1. HeLa cell extracts were mixed with anti-fibrillarin antibodies fixed on protein A-Sepharose and treated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The pellet was separated on SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting was performed using anti-Tgs1 antibodies. Input (50 μg of total extract) represents 10% of the amount used in the immunoprecipitation experiments, control (ctrl) corresponds to extracts mixed with protein A-Sepharose beads alone, and pellet represents the fraction bound to the resin. B, in vitro translated 35S-labeled fibrillarin-Nter, Nop56Cter, and 15.5 proteins were incubated with the indicated GST-recombinant fusion proteins or GST alone. Bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Input was as in A. C, binding assay of recombinant GST fusion proteins carrying the Nter or Cter domains of Tgs1. The recombinant fusion proteins were incubated with in vitro translated 35S-labeled dyskerin and Nhp2 proteins. Input and bound proteins were treated as described in C. D, ex vivo binding assays. A plasmid encoding the GST fusion protein carrying the region of Tgs1 encompassing amino acids 380–end as well as a plasmid encoding GST alone were transfected into HeLa cells.

Control (Ctrl) corresponds to lysate incubated with CL6B-Sepharose beads.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We next investigated the subcellular localization of the Tgs1 isoforms, since it was previously shown that the Tgs1 hypermethylase localizes both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus in Cajal bodies (17Mouaikel J.

Blanchard J.M. Bordonne R. Bertrand E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2736-2745Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1C, fractionation of HeLa cells extracts into nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments indicates that the full-length Tgs1 protein is found mainly in the cytoplasm, whereas the short sTgs1 isoform is located in the nucleus. In order to test whether Tgs1 isoforms are detected when lysates are made under denaturing conditions, we prepared extracts by direct lysis of cells in Laemmli-SDS buffer. As shown in Fig. 1D, the same pattern of bands was observed when the blot was probed with anti-Tgs1 antibodies, suggesting that the short isoform is not produced by proteolytic degradation during the preparation of the extracts.Detection of a Unique Full-length Tgs1 Transcript—We next investigated the mechanisms responsible for the production of the sTgs1 protein and tested whether this isoform could be generated through alternative splicing of the Tgs1 pre-mRNA. This hypothesis was first tested by performing Northern blot analysis of total RNA isolated from different tissues. As shown in Fig. 2A, only one transcript of ∼3.2 kb was detected in the different tissues, and no RNA corresponding to an alternatively spliced version capable to encode the short Tgs1 isoform could be detected. A unique transcript was also detected by Northern analysis on total RNA prepared from HeLa cells (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 2Detection of Tgs1 transcripts.

https://openalex.org/W2092301170,"Background Dietary restriction (DR) and reduced insulin/IGF-I-like signaling (IIS) are two regimens that promote longevity in a variety of organisms. Genetic analysis in C. elegans nematodes has shown that DR and IIS couple to distinct cellular signaling pathways. However, it is not known whether these pathways ultimately converge on overlapping or distinct targets to extend lifespan. Principal Findings We investigated this question by examining additional effects of DR in wildtype animals and in daf-2 mutants with either moderate or severe IIS deficits. Surprisingly, DR and IIS had opposing effects on these physiological processes. First, DR induced a stress-related change in intestinal vesicle trafficking, termed the FIRE response, which was suppressed in daf-2 mutants. Second, DR did not strongly affect expression of a daf-2- and stress-responsive transcriptional reporter. Finally, DR-related growth impairment was suppressed in daf-2 mutants. Conclusions These findings reveal that an important biological function of DAF-2/IIS is to enhance growth and survival under nutrient-limited conditions. However, we also discovered that levels of DAF-2 pathway activity modified the effects of DR on longevity. Thus, while DR and IIS clearly affect lifespan through independent targets, there may also be some prolongevity targets that are convergently regulated by these pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1999310792,"In skin, the physiological consequence of an epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) deficiency is not obvious directly at birth. Nevertheless, within hours after birth, mice deficient for the α-subunit of the highly amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channel (αENaC/Scnn1a) suffer from a significant increased dehydration. This is characterized by a loss of body weight (by 6% in 6 h) and an increased transepidermal water loss, which is accompanied by a higher skin surface pH in 1-day-old pups. Although early and late differentiation markers, as well as tight junction protein distribution and function, seem unaffected, deficiency of αENaC severely disturbs the stratum corneum lipid composition with decreased ceramide and cholesterol levels, and increased pro-barrier lipids, whereas covalently bound lipids are drastically reduced. Ultrastructural analysis revealed morphological changes in the formation of intercellular lamellar lipids and the lamellar body secretion. Extracellular formation of the lamellar lipids proved to be abnormal in the knockouts. In conclusion, ENaC deficiency results in progressive dehydration and, consequently, weight loss due to severe impairment of lipid formation and secretion.

Schild L. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 735-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar). It is composed of three highly homologous subunits (α-, β-, and γENaC) encoding Scnn1a, Scnn1b, and Scnn1g and characterized in several species, including man and mouse (3Canessa C.M.

Patch clamp recordings of human keratinocytes reveal a sodium channel conductance that is blocked by benzamil with similar affinity and voltage dependence of the amiloride block as previously described for ENaC (13Brouard M. Casado M. Djelidi S. Barrandon Y. Farman N. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3343-3352PubMed Google Scholar). Further evidence that ENaC-mediated Na+ transport may be implicated in keratinocyte and epidermal differentiation comes from the previous analysis of newborn αENaC knockout mice, which exhibit epidermal thickening and premature lipid secretion in the upper epidermis, suggesting that ENaC-mediated sodium ion fluxes control selective aspects of keratinocyte differentiation (14Mauro T.

The skin is a physical barrier at the interface between an organism and its environment preventing water loss and withstanding mechanical, chemical, and microbial assaults. To perform these functions, the epidermis as outer layer of the skin undergoes keratinization, a process in which epidermal cells progressively mature from basal cells with proliferative potential to lifeless flattened squames of the stratum corneum. This differentiation is accompanied by alterations in gene expression, affecting structural proteins, expression, and activation of enzymes that control post-translational modifications, metabolic changes, and lipid synthesis (15Roop D. Science. 1995; 267: 474-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). A defect in any one of these structural components or enzymatic processes has therefore the potential to impair the barrier function of the skin and to cause diseases. Given the important role played by ENaC in the whole body sodium ion homeostasis, we sought to reveal its physiological role in skin. At birth, no differences in physiological parameters could be identified, but a few hours later, αENaC knockout mice show a severe life-threatening transepidermal water loss, and major impairment of the barrier function due to highly disturbed lipid secretion and formation. This dehydration is accompanied by impaired acidification of the skin surface pH. Our data demonstrate that this sodium channel is not required for establishment of the epidermal barrier function but rather for maintaining this barrier function in postnatal life. Transgenic αENaC homozygous mutant (–/–, knockout), heterozygous mutant (+/–), and wild-type (+/+) littermates were obtained by interbreeding mice heterozygous mutant for the αENaC allele (Scnn1atm1 (16Hummler E. Barker P. Gatzy J. Beermann F. Verdumo C. Schmidt A. Boucher R. Rossier B.C. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 325-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar)) and analyzed after birth. Genotyping was performed by PCR essentially as described (17Hummler E. Barker P. Talbot C. Wang Q. Verdumo C. Grubb B. Gatzy J. Burnier M. Horisberger J-D. Beermann F. Boucher R. Rossier B.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11710-11715Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed coded. Animals were kept on a 14:10-h light-dark cycle. Experimental procedures and animal maintenance followed federal guidelines and were approved by local authorities. At birth, (α)ENaC knockout animals present a metabolic acidosis as found by Hummler and coworkers (17Hummler E. Barker P. Talbot C. Wang Q. Verdumo C. Grubb B. Gatzy J. Burnier M. Horisberger J-D. Beermann F. Boucher R. Rossier B.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11710-11715Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), but for our present skin analysis, only animals without apparent respiratory distress syndrome have been considered for further analysis. Skin Permeability Assay—Newborn mice were killed and subjected to methanol dehydration and subsequent rehydration as described previously (18Koch P.J. de Viragh P.A. Scharer E. Bundman D. Longley M.A. Bickenbach J. Kawachi Y. Suga Y. Zhou z. Huber M. Hohl D. Kartasova T. Jarnik M. Steven A.C. Roop D.R. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 389-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). They were further washed in PBS, stained overnight at 4 °C in 0.1% toluidine blue/PBS (Merck), destained in PBS, and photographed with a digital camera (Coolpix 950, Nikon) (19Leyvraz C. Charles R.P. Rubera I. Guitard M. Rotman S. Breiden B. Sandhoff K. Hummler E. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 487-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Measurement of the Transepidermal Water Loss—The rate of transepidermal water loss (TEWL) from the ventral skin of newborn mice was determined by using a Tewameter (Courage and Khazaka) as described previously (20Matsuki M. Yamashita F. Ishida-Yamamoto A. Yamada K. Kinoshita C. Fushiki S. Ueda E. Morishima Y. Tabata K. Yasuno H. Hashida M. Iizuka H. Ikawa M. Okabe M. Kondoh G. Kinoshita T. Takeda J. Yamanishi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1044-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Dehydration Assay—To determine the rate of fluid loss (19Leyvraz C. Charles R.P. Rubera I. Guitard M. Rotman S. Breiden B. Sandhoff K. Hummler E. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 487-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), newborns from five independent litters were separated from their mother to prevent fluid intake, and the rate of epithelial water loss was calculated by measuring the reduction of body weight as a function of time. Tight Junction Permeability Assay—The tight junction functional test was performed as described (21Chen Y. Merzdorf C. Paul D.L. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 891-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 22Furuse M. Hata M. Furuse K. Yoshida Y. Haratake A. Sugitani Y. Noda T. Kubo A. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 1099-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar). Following subcutaneous injection of biotin (∼300 Dalton, Pierce), skin samples were snap frozen. Cryosections (10 μm thick) were prepared, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS buffer, and incubated with streptavidin FC630 overnight at 4 °C (Fluoprobes, Interchim, Montluçon, France). Fluorescence was visualized using laser scanning confocal microscopy (model LSM510 Meta, Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc.). For each genotype (wild type and knockout), three pups were independently analyzed. Nuclei were counterstained with 0.2 μg/ml DAPI (Roche Applied Science) in mounting medium (Dako Schweiz AG, Switzerland, Baar). Skin Surface pH—Skin surface pH of littermates was determined with a pH meter (PH900, Courage and Khazaka, Cologne, Germany). Briefly, a few microliters of bi-distilled water was applied on the skin surface, and a flat glass surface electrode (Mettler-Toledo, Giessen, Germany) was put on the top to equilibrate. The skin surface pH was then measured according to the manufacturer's guidelines. Immunohistochemistry was performed on littermates. Tissue from knockout and wild-type mice was fixed overnight in 4.5% phosphate-buffered formalin (pH 7) and embedded in paraffin. Following deparaffinization in xylene and progressive rehydration, 4-μm sagittal sections were incubated with primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature after treatment with unmasking solution (10 mm Tris, 0.5 mm EGTA, pH 9, boiling for 10 min). Staining was visualized by laser scanning microscopy after 1 h of incubation at room temperature with Alexa633-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG for involucrin, loricrin, and filaggrin or Alexa488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen) for K1, K6, and K14. All primary rabbit antibodies were purchased from Covance and were used at a dilution of 1:1000 except for K14 (1:4000). Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. To analyze tight junction proteins, skin was dissected and frozen in optimum cutting temperature compound (OCT, Tissue-Tek, Sakura, Zoeterwoude, Netherlands). Cryosections (10 μm thick) were processed to further fixation (30 min in 95% ethanol at 4 °C and 1 min in acetone at room temperature) and permeabilization (10 min in 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS). Following 30 min in PBS/3% bovine serum albumin blocking solution, sections were incubated with primary antibody at room temperature for 1 h. Rabbit anti-claudin-1 polyclonal antibody (Zymed Laboratories) was used (1:100 dilution) in combination with Alexa633-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen) on paraffin sections (as described above). Rat anti-occludin (MOC37) and mouse anti-ZO-1 (T8–754) polyclonal antibody (kindly provided by M. Furuse, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan) were combined with anti-rat FC488-conjugated (Fluoprobes) and anti-mouse Alexa546-conjugated antibodies (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen), respectively. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. Immunofluorescence labeling was visualized by laser scanning microscopy. Whole skin of newborns was homogenized in ice-cold 8 m urea, 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 10 mm EDTA using the tissue lyser, 4 × 30 s (Qiagen). Following 30-min incubation on ice, lysates were centrifuged (13,000 × g for 15 min at 0 °C) and quantified using the protein assay (BCA, Pierce). For SDS-PAGE, 50 μg of proteins was loaded and separated on a 10% acrylamide gel. Western blot analysis was performed using rabbit antibodies to K14 (1:10,000), K1 (1:10,000), K6 (1:10,000), filaggrin (1:5,000), loricrin (1:5,000), and involucrin (1:5,000, Covance, Berkeley, CA). Signals were revealed with anti-rabbit IgG from donkey (1:2,000) as secondary antibody and the SuperSignal detection system (West Dura System, Pierce). Whole skin from newborns was removed at autopsy, frozen, and stored at –20 °C until further treatment. Stratum corneum preparations, lipid analysis, and recovery of covalently bound lipids were performed as described previously (23Reichelt J. Breiden B. Sandhoff K. Magin T.M. Eur J. Cell Biol. 2004; 83: 747-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Standard electron microscopy approach consisted of tissue fixation in 2% glutaraldehyde solution in sodium cacodylate buffer, followed by washing and post-fixation in 1% osmium tetroxide (OsO4, Sigma) in the same buffer. For lamellar lipid visualization, skin biopsies were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2), washed in PBS, and post-fixed in 0.25% ruthenium tetroxide (RuO4, Polysciences Inc., Warrington, PA) instead of OsO4. Thus prepared small tissue fragments were dehydrated in graded ethanol series and embedded in Epon at 60 °C. Ultrathin sections recovered on copper grids were counterstained in uranyl acetate and lead citrate (24Haftek M. Teillon M.H. Schmitt D. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1998; 43: 242-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). All data are expressed as means ± S.E. Values of n refer to the number of mice in each group. Individual groups were compared by using the t test for pair-wise comparisons. To test the independence of groups (dehydration assay), the Kruskal and Wallis statistical test was used. A level of p < 0.05 was accepted as statistically significant for all comparisons. Time-dependent Impairment of the Epidermal Barrier Function in αENaC-deficient Mice—To study the physiological consequences of ENaC deficiency in the skin, we first tested the functional integrity of the epidermis by a toluidine blue penetration test across the entire epidermal surface. Directly at birth, pups from the knockout group did not show increased blue staining compared with the heterozygous and the wild-type mice (Fig. 1A). We then tested the outward barrier function by a dehydration test, thus determining the reduction in body weight as a function of time. The dehydration rate (milligrams/h/g of body weight) was significantly different in the knockout group (p < 0.001, Fig. 1B). When following one litter over 6.5 h after birth, the dehydration was evident at 2 h after birth (3% water loss versus 1% in the control littermates, p < 0.01) and, at 6 h after birth, the difference in dehydration reached almost 7% of their body weight (compared with 2% in the control (+/+ and +/–) littermates (p < 0.001, Fig. 1C). Dehydration through the skin was confirmed by TEWL. Although the values were not different within the first 12 h among the three groups (Fig. 1D), knockout neonates measured between 12 and 24 h after birth do display a significantly increased TEWL value (Fig. 1E, p < 0.05). When measuring TEWL values in pups from the same litter at an early (4 h) and late (24 h) time point after birth, we have clearly seen a reduction in the TEWL values in the heterozygous and wild-type groups with time, whereas the knockout group failed to reach the same basal levels (Fig. 1F, p > 0.05). This indicates that the skin of the knockout mice may not adapt normally to the external environment (Fig. 1F, p < 0.05). These data strongly suggest that αENaC expression is postnatally required to adapt the epidermal permeability barrier function. αENaC Is Required for Proper Expression of the Differentiation Marker K6, an Unspecific Marker for Proliferation—To unveil defects in epidermal differentiation, we studied the distribution as well as the expression levels of differentiation markers (supplemental Fig. S2). Immunohistochemistry revealed that keratin 14 (K14), a specific marker for the stratum basale was similarly expressed in epidermal basal cells of wild-type and knockout neonates. Equally, the distribution of an intermediate (keratin 1) and the epidermal terminal differentiation markers (loricrin, involucrin, and filaggrin) was similar in skin from both wild-type and knockout mice (supplemental Fig. S1). Loricrin staining was observed in the top stratum granulosum (SG) and continued in the stratum corneum (SC). Involucrin staining was strong in the SC but was also found in the SG and slightly in the stratum spinosum (SP). In contrast, the expression of keratin 6 (K6), that was normally restricted to the outer root sheath of the hair follicle in wild-type mice, was expressed throughout the interfollicular epidermis in knockout animals indicative for a hyperproliferation (supplemental Fig. S1). The near-normal expression of the early and late differentiation markers was confirmed by Western blot analysis (supplemental Fig. S2). Additionally, processing of filaggrin, from profilaggrin (300 kDa) to the two-domain intermediate monomers 2DI (50 kDa) and 1DI (25 kDa) was not disturbed (supplemental Fig. S2). In summary, except for keratin 6, none of the analyzed early, intermediate, and late differentiation markers was altered in the knockout group. Tight Junction Protein Distribution and Functionality Are Not Altered—The impaired skin barrier function may be caused by leakiness of tight junction proteins in the epidermis. However, immunohistochemical analysis shows a normal distribution of tight junction proteins (Fig. 2). Claudin-1 was localized in the whole epidermis except for the SC and the last layer of SG (Fig. 2A). ZO-1 was detected in the mid-SG, and occludin showed a dotted staining, as expected for the presence of tight junctions (Fig. 2A, arrows). We then examined whether the barrier function of the tight junctions was affected. Injection of biotin into the dermis and streptavidin revelation on the sections showed normal diffusion through the paracellular spaces of the epidermis from stratum basale to the supposed localization of the tight junction complexes at the mid-SG (Fig. 2B, arrows). These data clearly indicate that the tight junctions were unchanged in the knockout animals. This experiment has been performed at 4 and 24 h after birth and showed the same results at both time points. αENaC Knockout Mice Exhibit Severe Defects in Lipid Matrix Composition and Highly Impaired Lamellar Lipids—Because content and localization of differentiation markers (see supplemental Fig. S2) seem not to be affected, nor the tight junctions, we focused our analysis on lipid composition. We analyzed the lipid profile (probarrier lipids, lamellar lipids, and covalently bound lipids) at 5 h after birth, and compared it with the lipid profile at 31 h after birth (Fig. 3, A–F). In the αENaC-knockout mice, ceramides and cholesterol levels based on dry weight were significantly decreased, whereas the level of the fatty acids was unchanged (Fig. 3, A–D). The ceramides are preferentially formed of probarrier lipids, glucosylceramide (25Hamanaka S. Hara M. Nishio H. Otsuka F. Suzuki A. Uchida Y. J. Invest.

Feingold K.R. Elias P.M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1998; 111: 784-790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The ceramide precursors glucosylceramide and sphingomyelin are both accumulated in the knockout mice (Fig. 3, B–E). In αENaC-deficient skin, the level of cholesterol sulfate is increased to nearly 2-fold (at 5 h) and 1.6-fold of wild-type mice at 24 h after birth. Interestingly, the heterozygous mutants (+/–) mice display an intermediate phenotype between the wild-type and knockout group, although dehydration and body weight loss are not different from the control (wild-type) group (Figs. 1, B–F, and Fig. 3, A–D). Further densitometric quantification of the ceramides (see supplemental Fig. S2 and Table 1) showed that the decrease observed in total ceramides affected all the ceramides and seemed to be improving with time (31 h compared with 5 h). As the covalently bound lipids are important for the lamellar lipid organization and, therefore, the barrier function, the extractable lipids of the SC samples were removed, and covalent-bound lipids were released by alkaline hydrolysis. The levels of ω-hydroxylated fatty acid, Cer(OS), Cer(OP), and GlcCer(OS) were significantly decreased in the knockout group and this was observed at both time points (Fig. 3, C–F, and Table 2), whereas the Cer(OH) lipid fraction was unchanged (Table 2). Altogether, these data support a disturbed lipid composition with impaired formation of the lamellar lipids of the extracellular lipid matrix in the αENaC knockout mice.TABLE 1Ceramide composition-/- [ng/mg dry SC]Genotypes +/- [ng/mg dry SC]+/+ [ng/mg dry SC] 5 hCer(EOS)3.524 ± 0.392ap < 0.001.5.046 ± 0.7392bp < 0.01.7.412 ± 0.7584Cer(C26-NS)15.712 ± 0.8944ap < 0.001.28.824 ± 1.528830.486 ± 1.0728Cer(C18-NS)13.256 ± 0.9032ap < 0.001.17.712 ± 1.1144bp < 0.01.21.934 ± 1.5888x11.326 ± 0.21761.680 ± 0.52801.678 ± 0.2896Cer(NP)2.276 ± 0.2512bp < 0.01.3.606 ± 0.54323.648 ± 0.6096Cer(C26-AS)1.674 ± 0.49682.238 ± 0.54562.454 ± 0.6768Cer(C18-AS)0.888 ± 0.1432ap < 0.001.1.594 ± 0.33281.946 ± 0.2392Cer(C26-AP)/0.094 ± 0.05280.138 ± 0.06960.186 ± 0.0473Cer(C26-AH)Cer(C18-AP)/0.120 ± 0.040.118 ± 0.06560.084 ± 0.0352Cer(C18-AH)x20.092 ± 0.03840.176 ± 0.06480.142 ± 0.0584 31 hCer(EOS)3.750 ± 0.2600ap < 0.001.3.716 ± 0.2288ap < 0.001.2.634 ± 0.0632Cer(C26-NS)12.504 ± 1.2888ap < 0.001.14.950 ± 0.9200bp < 0.01.18.000 ± 0.7600Cer(C18-NS)9.912 ± 0.8304ap < 0.001.14.560 ± 0.6720ap < 0.001.17.400 ± 0.4280x11.978 ± 0.2376bp < 0.01.1.672 ± 0.0744ap < 0.001.2.522 ± 0.0552Cer(NP)3.874 ± 0.1648ap < 0.001.4.498 ± 0.3576bp < 0.01.5.646 ± 0.2592Cer(C26-AS)2.300 ± 0.1760bp < 0.01.2.672 ± 0.21042.860 ± 0.1440Cer(C18-AS)1.630 ± 0.1000ap < 0.001.1.328 ± 0.06561.253 ± 0.0438Cer(C26-AP)/0.530 ± 0.04400.392 ± 0.0304cp < 0.05.0.496 ± 0.0472Cer(C26-AH)Cer(C18-AP)/0.264 ± 0.03680.200 ± 0.0280cp < 0.05.0.268 ± 0.0336Cer(C18-AH)x20.588 ± 0.0936cp < 0.05.0.410 ± 0.03600.390 ± 0.0400a p < 0.001.b p < 0.01.c p < 0.05.

https://openalex.org/W2068842674,"We have identified the RhoBTB2 putative tumor suppressor gene as a direct target of the E2F1 transcription factor. Overexpression of E2F1 led to up-regulation of RhoBTB2 at the level of mRNA and protein. This also occurred during the induction of E2F1 activity in the presence of cycloheximide, thus indicating that RhoBTB2 is a direct target. RNAi-mediated knockdown of E2F1 resulted in decreased RhoBTB2 protein expression, demonstrating that RhoBTB2 is a physiological target of E2F1. Because E2F1 primarily serves to transcribe genes involved in cell cycle progression and apoptosis, we explored whether RhoBTB2 played roles in either of these processes. We found RhoBTB2 expression highly up-regulated during mitosis, which was partially dependent on the presence of E2F1. Furthermore, overexpression of RhoBTB2 induced a short term increase in cell cycle progression and proliferation, while long term expression had a negative effect on these processes. We similarly found RhoBTB2 up-regulated during drug-induced apoptosis, with this being primarily dependent on E2F1. Finally, we observed that knockdown of RhoBTB2 levels via siRNA delayed the onset of drug-induced apoptosis. Collectively, we describe RhoBTB2 as a novel direct target of E2F1 with roles in cell cycle and apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2043276968,"The 3′-untranslated regions (UTRs) of human papillomavirus 16 (HPV16) and bovine papillomavirus 1 (BPV1) contain a negative regulatory element (NRE) that inhibits viral late gene expression. The BPV1 NRE consists of a single 9-nucleotide (nt) U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) base pairing site (herein called a U1 binding site) that via U1 snRNP binding leads to inhibition of the late poly(A) site. The 79-nt HPV16 NRE is far more complicated, consisting of 4 overlapping very weak U1 binding sites followed by a poorly understood GU-rich element (GRE). We undertook a molecular dissection of the HPV16 GRE and identify via UV cross-linking, RNA affinity chromatography, and mass spectrometry that is bound by the CUG-binding protein 1 (CUGBP1). Reporter assays coupled with knocking down CUGBP1 levels by small interfering RNA and Dox-regulated shRNA, demonstrate CUGBP1 is inhibitory in vivo. CUGBP1 is the first GRE-binding protein to have RNA interfering knockdown evidence in support of its role in vivo. Several fine-scale GRE mutations that inactivate GRE activity in vivo and GRE binding to CUGBP1 in vitro are identified. The CUGBP1·GRE complex has no activity on its own but specifically synergizes with weak U1 binding sites to inhibit expression in vivo. No synergy is seen if the U1 binding sites are made weaker by a 1-nt down-mutation or made stronger by a 1-nt up-mutation, underscoring that the GRE operates only on weak sites. Interestingly, inhibition occurs at multiple levels, in particular at the level of poly(A) site activity, nuclear-cytoplasmic export, and translation of the mRNA. Implications for understanding the HPV16 life cycle are discussed.

CUGBP1 is the first GRE-binding protein to have RNA interfering knockdown evidence in support of its role in vivo. Several fine-scale GRE mutations that inactivate GRE activity in vivo and GRE binding to CUGBP1 in vitro are identified. The CUGBP1·GRE complex has no activity on its own but specifically synergizes with weak U1 binding sites to inhibit expression in vivo. No synergy is seen if the U1 binding sites are made weaker by a 1-nt down-mutation or made stronger by a 1-nt up-mutation, underscoring that the GRE operates only on weak sites. Interestingly, inhibition occurs at multiple levels, in particular at the level of poly(A) site activity, nuclear-cytoplasmic export, and translation of the mRNA. Implications for understanding the HPV16 life cycle are discussed. The human epidermis consists of layers of keratinocytes that broadly speaking represent separate stages of differentiation (1Fuchs E. Raghavan S. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 199-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). The basal layer of cells are the rapidly dividing progeny of epithelial stem cells that, as they transit upwards, slow down in cell growth and division, and flatten out to eventually become terminally differentiated keratinocytes at the stratum corneum. The life cycle of papillomaviruses, small ∼8000-bp DNA viruses, is intimately connected to the differentiation program of keratinocytes (2zur Hausen H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1288: F55-F78Crossref PubMed Scopus (1480) Google Scholar) such that they can readily infect almost any type of mammalian cultured cell but are unable to complete the viral life cycle.

Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. 3rd Ed. Fields Virology. 2. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia1996: 2045-2076Google Scholar). Of the more than 100 types of HPVs that are sequenced, only a handful account for nearly all cervical carcinomas and intraepithelial neoplasias, with HPV type 16 (HPV16) causing about 60% of the cases, making it the most clinically significant of the HPVs and one of the most studied (4zur Hausen H.

In addition to HPV16, HPV1 that causes non-malignant lesions and bovine papillomavirus 1 (BPV1) have also been intensively studied and serve as prototypes for understanding HPVs (6Zheng Z.M.

Biosci. 2006; 11: 2286-2302Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). human papillomavirus type 16 bovine papillomavirus type 1 3′-untranslated region poly(A) site U1 snRNP binding site HPV16 GU-rich element small nuclear RNA small nuclear ribonucleoprotein CUG-binding protein 1 ribonuclease protection assay negative regulatory element nucleotide(s) short hairpin electrophoretic mobility shift assay small interfering RNA phosphate-buffered saline glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase splice site binding buffer wild type GU-rich element doxycyline myotonic dystrophy muscle-blind like 1. human papillomavirus type 16 bovine papillomavirus type 1 3′-untranslated region poly(A) site U1 snRNP binding site HPV16 GU-rich element small nuclear RNA small nuclear ribonucleoprotein CUG-binding protein 1 ribonuclease protection assay negative regulatory element nucleotide(s) short hairpin electrophoretic mobility shift assay small interfering RNA phosphate-buffered saline glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase splice site binding buffer wild type GU-rich element doxycyline myotonic dystrophy muscle-blind like 1. The genomic structure of papillomaviruses shares many common features. For example, all of the viral open reading frames are located on one strand of the viral genomic DNA with the early expressed genes being clustered and distinct from the late expressed genes (7Chan S-Y. Delius H. Halpern A.L. Bernard H.-U. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3074-3083Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Baker C.C. Psister H. Papillomavirus and Human Cancer. CRC Press Inc., Boca Raton, FL1990: 91-112Google Scholar). Downstream of the late L2 capsid gene open reading frame is the ∼850-bp long control region that contains sequence elements that control DNA replication, transcription initiation, and post-transcriptional events (4zur Hausen H. Schneider A. Salzman N. Howley P.M. The Papovaviridae. Plenum Press, New York1987: 245-263Crossref Google Scholar). Viral early genes are expressed in undifferentiated and intermediately differentiated keratinocytes, whereas the products of the late genes, i.e. the L1 and L2 capsid proteins, are expressed only in the terminally differentiated epithelial layer. The viral P97 early promoter is active throughout all layers of the epithelial and governs transcription of the viral early genes (9Smotkin D. Wettstein F.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4680-4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). In contrast, the viral P670 (also called P742) late promoter is only active in partially as well as fully differentiated keratinocytes and this depends on cell differentiation factors as well as viral DNA amplification (10Grassmann K. Wilczynski S.P. Cook N. Rapp B. Iftner T. Virology. 1996; 223: 185-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 11Longworth M.S. Laimins L.A. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 3533-3541Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 12Bodily J.M. Meyers C. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 3309-3321Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Although P670 promoter activation is clearly necessary for late gene expression, many of the experimental approaches to establish this did not rule out changes in transcript stability as an alternative explanation. The fact that late transcripts are detected in partially differentiated keratinocytes even though late proteins are restricted to terminally differentiated keratinocytes (13Stoler M.H. Wolinsky S.M. Whitbeck A. Broker T.R. Chow L.T. Virology. 1989; 172: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 14Barksdale S.K. Baker C.C. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 5605-5616Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) has led to increased focus on post-transcriptional control mechanisms that are now viewed as having an equal if not more important role than transcription activation in viral late gene expression (6Zheng Z.M. Baker C.C. Front. Biosci. 2006; 11: 2286-2302Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). For example, the late transcripts partially overlap with early transcripts such that splicing of intron 2 of L1 removes the early poly(A) site. Cis-acting inhibitory elements, also referred to as negative regulatory elements (NREs), that repress late gene expression at the post-transcriptional level have been mapped to the L1 and L2 open reading frames of HPV16 (15Collier B.

McPhillips M. Radford J.C. Clements J.B. Graham S.V. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 5993-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Among the NREs, BPV1 is the best understood mechanistically (Fig. 1A) and consists of a single autonomously acting 9-nt sequence that exactly matches the consensus 5′ splice site sequence that binds the U1 snRNP splicing factor (21Furth P.A. Choe W. Rex J.H. Byrne J.C. Baker C.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5278-5289Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). U1 snRNP is best known for its role in splicing where it nucleates early steps in spliceosome assembly by base pairing to the 5′ splice site. However, when a consensus 5′ splice site is located in the terminal exon, and so lacks a downstream 3′ splice site to catalyze splicing, it potently inhibits gene expression by binding to U1 snRNP leading to inhibition of poly(A) site activity (21Furth P.A.

We designate as terminal-exon-located 5′ splice site sequences, like the one found in BPV1, U1 binding sites so as to clearly distinguish that they do not function in splicing. A battery of in vivo and in vitro assays has shown the complex formed between the BPV1 U1 binding site and U1 snRNP is sufficient to inhibit the BPV1 late poly(A) site as well as poly(A) site signals from other genes (21Furth P.A.

U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8264-8269Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The inhibitory mechanism involves an interaction between the 70-kDa subunit of U1 snRNP (U1-70K) and poly(A) polymerase (22Gunderson S.I. Polycarpou-Schwarz M. Mattaj I.W. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 255-264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). When the poly(A) site is inhibited, the primary transcript fails to mature as it lacks a poly(A) tail and so is degraded by the nuclear exosome. In its natural context the BPV1 U1 binding site is unusually close to the poly(A) signal (7 nt), however, work from many groups has shown that single U1 binding sites inhibit polyadenylation even when placed from 100s up to 1300 nt away from the poly(A) signal (21Furth P.A. Choe W. Rex J.H. Byrne J.C. Baker C.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5278-5289Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 23Beckley S.A. Liu P. Stover M.L. Gunderson S.I. Lichtler A.C. Rowe D.W. Mol.

This has led to a proposal that inhibition involves disruption of the definition of the terminal exon by disrupting interactions between the poly(A) signal and the splicing out of the upstream 3′ terminal intron. The identification of the highly inhibitory BPV1 NRE (i.e. U1 binding site) led to extensive mapping efforts to identify NREs in HPVs, including the 79-nt HPV16 NRE that spans from the last few nucleotides of the L1 coding region into the viral late 3′-UTR (Fig. 1B) (21Furth P.A. Choe W. Rex J.H. Byrne J.C. Baker C.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5278-5289Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 26Koffa M.D. Graham S.V. Takagaki Y. Manley J.L. Clements J.B. Proc. Natl.

Virol. 2003; 77: 5167-5177Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In reporter plasmids where the 3′-UTR and sequences past the poly(A) site are derived from the corresponding HPV16 sequences, expression of the reporter is low. Deletion of the NRE but not other parts of the 3′-UTR resulted in a large increase in expression ranging from 40- to 100-fold depending on the transfection conditions and cell types used (18Kennedy I.M. Haddow J.K. Clements J.B. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1825-1829Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Furth P.A. Choe W. Rex J.H. Byrne J.C. Baker C.C. Mol. Cell.

Virol. 2003; 77: 5167-5177Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). As diagrammed in Fig. 1B, the HPV16 NRE can be divided into a 5′ segment and a 3′ GU-rich segment. The 5′ segment contains four weak, overlapping matches to the 5′ splice site consensus sequence that act as weak U1 binding sites (26Koffa M.D. Graham S.V. Takagaki Y. Manley J.L. Clements J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4677-4682Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Unlike the case with BPV1, however, each of the four weak U1 binding sites of HPV16 has no activity on its own and there are many aspects of the inhibitory mechanism that remain unclear. The 3′ segment of the HPV-16 NRE is GU-rich and hence is called the GU-rich element (GRE). Several reports have identified cellular factors that bind the GRE including U2AF65, HuR, ASF/SF2, and the CstF64 subunit of the cleavage stimulatory factor (26Koffa M.D. Graham S.V. Takagaki Y. Manley J.L. Clements J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4677-4682Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 27Cumming S.A. McPhillips M.G. Veerapraditsin T. Milligan S.G. Graham S.V. J.

Virol. 2004; 78: 10598-10605Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Importantly, however, none of these GRE-binding proteins has been shown to function in vivo. For example, there are no reports that describe the effect on HPV16 NRE function of overexpression or RNA interference knockdown of these GRE-binding proteins. Although there is evidence in cell culture experiments that ASF/SF2 is up-regulated in HPV16-infected epithelial cells, the studies are correlative rather than causative (29McPhillips M.G. Veerapraditsin T. Cumming S.A. Karali D. Milligan S.G. Boner W. Morgan I.M. Graham S.V. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 10598-10605Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Here we undertook a mechanistic analysis of the HPV16 NRE by focusing on the GRE and its interaction with the weak U1 binding sites. On its own the GRE has no inhibitory activity but in conjunction with the upstream weak U1 binding sites gives enhanced inhibition. No enhancement is seen when the upstream weak sites are made stronger by a 1-nt up-mutation or weaker by a 1-nt down-mutation underscoring that the GRE specifically enhances weak U1 binding sites. We identify that CUG-binding protein 1 (CUGBP1) binds the GRE and demonstrate by knockdown studies that CUGBP1 functions in vivo. The specificity of our results is demonstrated by the identification of a fine-scale GRE mutation that inactivates its activity in vivo and its binding to CUGBP1 in vitro. Interestingly, inhibition occurs at multiple levels, in particular at the level of poly(A) site activity, nuclear-cytoplasmic export, and translation of the mRNA. Thus, CUGBP1 is another member of the GRE-binding family of proteins and it is the first member to have direct in vivo knockdown data in support of its role in the function of the HPV16 GRE. Plasmids—The pSV40/RL reporter (Promega) was modified by insertion of double-stranded DNA oligonucleotides into the XbaI site in the 3′-UTR to make the plasmids in Figs. 1C and 2, A and B. The reporter plasmids shown in Figs. 1D, 2C, 3, and 5C that contain the entire 308-nt HPV16 3′-UTR and 150 nt of the HPV-16 sequence past the late poly(A) site were made by PCR amplification of genomic HPV16 (kindly provided by Dr. Craig Meyers, Penn State University, Hershey PA). The resulting PCR product was inserted into pSV40/RL thereby replacing the SV40 3′-UTR and poly(A) signal sequences with those from HPV16. Mutations of the U1 binding sites and GRE were made by site-directed mutagenesis. All plasmids were verified by sequencing.FIGURE 3Affect of the GRE and U1 binding sites on mRNA. A, the upper autoradiogram is an RPA with an antisense RNA probe corresponding to the coding region of the Renilla reporter plasmid. Lane 2 contained 20 μg of total RNA from untransfected cells. Lanes 3-7 contained 20 μg of total RNA from 4 million HeLa cells transfected with 5 μg of each plasmid as indicated. Lane 1 contained 20 μg of yeast tRNA in place of the total RNA. The protected Renilla reporter-specific band is predicted to be 295 nt. The lower autoradiogram matches the 7 lanes of the upper panel except the probe is designed to detect endogenous GAPDH mRNA and only 5 μg of total RNA or tRNA were used.

To assess the quality of the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractionation, Northern blotting to detect U1 snRNA (lanes 14-23) was done with 2 μg of RNA loaded per lane. Lanes 14-23 are the same RNA samples as lanes 1-10. Lanes 11-13 were done to assess the dose response of the Northern blot and to demonstrate the assay is in probe excess.

The eight bar graphs in the middle are RPA signals of total RNA derived from the cytoplasmic (C) and nuclear fractions (N) with the values and error bars derived from 3 independent transfection assays.

Likewise the nuclear RNA from the transfected mtU1/GREmt plasmid serves as the reference point for the nuclear RNA samples and is set to 100%. All of the RPAs were quantitated by phosphoimagery using ImageQuant software.

The mixtures were placed as drops on a microwell plate and irradiated on ice with UV light at 254 nm for 10 min using a Stratalinker 2400 (Stratagene). Nonprotected RNA was digested for 20 min at 37 °C by addition of 1 μg of RNase A and then incubated for 10 min in the presence of 0.05% SDS. The proteins were resolved on a 12.5% SDS-PAGE, and the gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography. EMSA was done as previously described (30Gunderson S.I. Vagner S. Polycarpou-Schwarz M.

Silencing of CUGBP1 with siRNA and Dox-regulatable shRNA—The RNA oligos for siRNA were synthesized by Dharmacon to target the following human CUGBP1 sequence: 5′-AATTTGGCTGCACTAGCTGCT-3′. This same siRNA sequence has previously been shown to specifically silence CUGBP1 (31Timchenko N.A. Patel R. Iakova P. Cai Z.J. Quan L. Timchenko L.T. J. Biol.

The plasmid used to make the stable HeLa Trex cells that stably express a doxycycline-regulated anti-CUGBP1 shRNA off an H1 promoter was derived from pENTR™/H1/TO (Invitrogen). The shRNA sequence is 5′-TAGCAGCAGTAATTCTGTCAAC-3′ and corresponds to amino acids SSSSNSVN of CUGBP1. Expression and Purification of Recombinant (r) rCUGBP1—The plasmid encoding His-tagged CUGBP1 in a pET15 vector was kindly provided by Maurice Swanson (University of Florida). His-tagged rCUGBP1 was produced in BL21(DE3) cells and purified on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen). So as to facilitate removal of RNA that may remain bound to rCUGBP1, the purification included an RNase treatment step prior to the Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid step. The peak fraction was judged to be >98% pure when analyzed by Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE (data not shown). Affinity Chromatography with Biotinylated GRE RNA—Biotinylated GRE RNA was generated by in vitro transcription using a 3:2 ratio of biotin-rCTP to rCTP. 0.2 ml of streptavidin-agarose beads (Sigma) were washed 3 times in 1 ml of binding buffer 2 (BB2 = 200 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1.5 mm MgCl2) and then preblocked in 1 ml of BB2, 0.5 mg of bovine serum albumin, 50 μg of tRNA, and 50 μg of glycogen by rotating for 30 min. After 2 more washes the beads were resuspended in 0.2 ml of BB2 including 1 mm dithiothreitol, 120 units of RNasin, and 25 μg of biotinylated GRE RNA probe. After 30 min of rotation the beads were washed 2 times and resuspended in 4 ml of BB2 including 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 40 μg of tRNA, 200 units of RNasin, and combined with 1 ml of HeLa nuclear extract (7 mg of protein). After 30 min of rotation the beads were washed 3 times with 1 ml of BB2. Specifically bound proteins were eluted by addition of Laemmli buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. Protein bands were cut from a Coomassie Blue-stained gel and submitted for Mass Spectrometry to the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, Newark, proteomics facility. Transfections—HeLa cells were passaged in standard conditions and transfected with Polyfect (Qiagen) as per the manufacturer's instructions. For assays measuring just luciferase, 100 ng of each plasmid was transfected into 50,000 HeLa cells on a 24-well plate. 48 h after transfection luciferase activity was measured using the dual luciferase assay kit (Promega) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Normal human epithelial keratinocytes were purchased from Cambrex, grown in keratinocyte growth medium media, and transfected with Lipofectamine-2000 plus (Invitrogen).

https://openalex.org/W1966207212,"Recombination-like structures formed at origins of DNA replication may contribute to replication fidelity, sister chromatid cohesion, chromosome segregation, and overall genome stability. The Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) origin of plasmid replication (OriP) provides episomal genome stability through a poorly understood mechanism. We show here that recombinational repair proteins MRE11 and NBS1 are recruited to the Dyad Symmetry (DS) region of OriP in a TRF2- and cell cycle-dependent manner. Depletion of MRE11 or NBS1 by siRNA inhibits OriP replication and destabilized viral episomes. OriP plasmid maintenance was defective in MRE11 and NBS1 hypomorphic fibroblast cell lines and only integrated, non-episomal forms of EBV were detected in a lympoblastoid cell line derived from an NBS1-mutated individual. Two-dimensional agarose gel analysis of OriP DNA revealed that recombination-like structures resembling Holliday-junctions form at OriP in mid S phase. MRE11 and NBS1 association with DS coincided with replication fork pausing and origin activation, which preceded the formation of recombination structures. We propose that NBS1 and MRE11 promote replication-associated recombination junctions essential for EBV episomal maintenance and genome stability."
https://openalex.org/W2007043211,"Hemangioblasts are bi-potential precursors for blood and endothelial cells (BCs and ECs). Existence of the hemangioblast in vivo by its strict definition, i.e. a clonal precursor giving rise to these two cell types after division, is still debated. Using a combination of mitotic figure analysis, cell labeling and long-term cell tracing, we show that, in chicken, cell division does not play a major role during the entire ventral mesoderm differentiation process after gastrulation. One eighth of cells do undergo at least one round of division, but mainly give rise to daughter cells contributing to the same lineage. Approximately 7% of the dividing cells that contribute to either the BC or EC lineage meet the criteria of true hemangioblasts, with one daughter cell becoming a BC and the other an EC. Our data suggest that hemangioblast-type generation of BC/EC occurs, but is not used as a major mechanism during early chicken development. It remains unclear, however, whether hemangioblast-like progenitor cells play a more prominent role in later development."

Humans are exposed through milk and from sources of environmental contamination. Hitherto, the only vaccines available against Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis have been limited to veterinary use and comprised attenuated or killed organisms.We developed a vaccine comprising a fusion construct designated HAV, containing components of two secreted and two cell surface Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis proteins. HAV was transformed into DNA, human Adenovirus 5 (Ad5) and Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) delivery vectors. Full length expression of the predicted 95 kDa fusion protein was confirmed.Vaccination of naïve and Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis infected C57BL/6 mice using DNA-prime/MVA-boost or Ad5-prime/MVA-boost protocols was highly immunogenic resulting in significant IFN-gamma ELISPOT responses by splenocytes against recombinant vaccine antigens and a range of HAV specific peptides. This included strong recognition of a T-cell epitope GFAEINPIA located near the C-terminus of the fusion protein. Antibody responses to recombinant vaccine antigens and HAV specific peptides but not GFAEINPIA, also occurred. No immune recognition of vaccine antigens occurred in any sham vaccinated Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis infected mice. Vaccination using either protocol significantly attenuated pre-existing Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis infection measured by qPCR in spleen and liver and the Ad5-prime/MVA-boost protocol also conferred some protection against subsequent challenge. No adverse effects of vaccination occurred in any of the mice.A range of modern veterinary and clinical vaccines for the treatment and prevention of disease caused by Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis are needed. The present vaccine proved to be highly immunogenic without adverse effect in mice and both attenuated pre-existing Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis infection and conferred protection against subsequent challenge. Further studies of the present vaccine in naturally infected animals and humans are indicated."

Indeed, in Drosophila the interaction of 14-3-3 proteins with the BK channel associated protein Slob is regulated by calmodulin dependent protein kinase II (7Zhou Y. Schopperie W.M. Murrey H.

Tyrosine-dependent protein phosphorylation has been reported to inhibit, activate, or have no effect on BK channel activity that likely depends on both the tyrosine kinase and cellular system under investigation. For example, overexpression of active c-Src with mSlo in HEK293 cells resulted in channel activation (11Ling S.Z. Woronuk G. Sy L. Lev S. Braun A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30683-30689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), in contrast expression of c-Src with hSlo resulted in an inhibition of BK channel activity (1Alioua A.

In both cases the effect of c-Src was only observed at intracellular free calcium concentrations in the micromolar range. In several native systems Src family kinases generally appear to play an inhibitory role as inhibition of kinase activity results in channel activation (1Alioua A. Mahajan A. Nishimaru K. Zarei M.M.

Sci. 1999; 40: 1404-1417PubMed Google Scholar). However, tyrosine kinases have also been reported to activate BK channels in other systems (14Olsen M.L. Weaver A.K. Ritch P.S. Sontheimer H. J. Neurosci. Res. 2005; 81: 179-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 15Zhou R. Liu L.M. Hu D.Y. Cardiovasc. Res. 2005; 68: 327-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 19Holm N.R.

These data suggest multiple pathways by which protein tyrosine phosphorylation can regulate BK channels. Firstly, several independent lines of evidence support direct tyrosine kinase-mediated phosphorylation of the BK channel α-subunit, including: (i) overexpression of active c-Src, pyk2, and HCK tyrosine kinases results in phosphorylation of the α-subunits expressed in HEK cell lines (1Alioua A. Mahajan A. Nishimaru K. Zarei M.M. Stefani E. Toro L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14560-14565Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 11Ling S.Z. Woronuk G. Sy L. Lev S. Braun A.P.

Physiol. 2004; 287: C698-C706Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar); (ii) site-directed mutagenesis of a C-terminal tyrosine residue (Tyr-762) abolishes channel phosphorylation and regulation by overexpressed c-Src (11Ling S.Z. Woronuk G. Sy L. Lev S. Braun A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30683-30689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar); (iii) prostaglandin E2 stimulation results in phosphorylation of BK channel α-subunits in osteocarcinoma cells (13Rezzonico R. Schmid-Alliana A. Romey G. Bourget-Ponzio I. Breuil V. Breittmayer V. Tartare-Deckert S. Rossi B. Schmid-Antomarchi H. J. Bone Miner Res. 2002; 17: 869-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar); (iv) overexpressed c-Src co-localizes with BK channels expressed in HEK293 cells (1Alioua A. Mahajan A. Nishimaru K. Zarei M.M. Stefani E. Toro L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14560-14565Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and endogenous c-Src co-immunoprecipitates with BK channels in osteocarcinoma cells (13Rezzonico R. Schmid-Alliana A. Romey G. Bourget-Ponzio I. Breuil V. Breittmayer V. Tartare-Deckert S. Rossi B. Schmid-Antomarchi H. J. Bone Miner Res. 2002; 17: 869-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar); and (v) Src kinase can bind and phosphorylate the Drosophila BK channel α-subunit C terminus in vitro (16Wang J. Zhou Y. Wen H. Levitan I. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: (RC4)1-(RC4)7Crossref Google Scholar) and the tyrosine kinase FAK associates directly with BK channels in osteoblasts (20Rezzonico R. Cayatte C. Bourget-Ponzio I. Romey G. Belhacene N. Loubat A. Rocchi S. Van Obberghen E. Girault J.A. Rossi B. Schmid-Antomarchi H. J. Bone Miner Res. 2003; 18: 1863-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Secondly, in some systems, tyrosine kinase signaling pathways regulate BK channels indirectly through elevation of intracellular free calcium levels. For example, activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase erbB2 did not result in BK channel tyrosine phosphorylation in glioma cells, however, erbB2 activated BK channels in this system through elevation of intracellular free calcium (14Olsen M.L. Weaver A.K. Ritch P.S. Sontheimer H. J. Neurosci. Res. 2005; 81: 179-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In osteocarcinoma cells although prostaglandin E2 stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of BK channel α-subunits the prostaglandin E2 stimulation of channel activity appears to be mediated via an elevation of intracellular calcium rather than phosphorylation of the channel per se (13Rezzonico R. Schmid-Alliana A. Romey G. Bourget-Ponzio I. Breuil V. Breittmayer V. Tartare-Deckert S. Rossi B. Schmid-Antomarchi H. J. Bone Miner Res. 2002; 17: 869-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Taken together these data suggest multiple regulatory mechanisms by which tyrosine phosphorylation may regulate BK channel function. Importantly, few studies have addressed whether endogenous protein-tyrosine kinases/phosphatases closely associate with BK channels and whether direct BK channel α-subunit phosphorylation has an important functional consequence for BK channel regulation by endogenous tyrosine kinases/phosphatases. We recently demonstrated that BK channels may assemble with the actin-binding protein, cortactin (21Tian L. Chen L. McClafferty H. Sailer C.A. Ruth P. Knaus H.G. Shipston M.J. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 2046-2056Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar), which was originally identified as a major Src tyrosine kinase substrate of molecular weight 80–85 kDa and is a major tyrosine phosphoprotein in cells (22Daly R.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 13-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 23Lua B.L. Low B.C. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 24Weed S.A. Parsons J.T. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6418-6434Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Cortactin can be phosphorylated on multiple tyrosine residues, and cortactin phosphorylation status has been implicated in modulation of actin cytoskeletal dynamics (22Daly R.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 13-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 23Lua B.L. Low B.C. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 24Weed S.A. Parsons J.T. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6418-6434Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, in osteocarcinoma cells the major native tyrosine phosphorylated proteins that co-immunoprecipitate constitutively with native BK channels have a molecular mass of ∼80–85 kDa (13Rezzonico R. Schmid-Alliana A. Romey G. Bourget-Ponzio I. Breuil V. Breittmayer V. Tartare-Deckert S. Rossi B. Schmid-Antomarchi H. J. Bone Miner Res. 2002; 17: 869-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) suggestive, albeit not demonstrated, of the major associated phosphoprotein being cortactin. This suggested that an important additional level of BK channel modulation by tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent signaling pathways may also be mediated by changes in tyrosine phosphorylation status of channel-associated proteins rather than through α-subunit phosphorylation and/or regulation by calcium. Furthermore, phosphorylation status is dependent upon the reciprocal action of protein kinases and phosphatases. However, the role of endogenous protein-tyrosine kinases and phosphatases that may closely associate with the BK channel complex are poorly understood. In this study we have addressed the role of cortactin and endogenous Src family protein-tyrosine kinase activity and protein-tyrosine phosphatase activity in mediating regulation of BK channels expressed in HEK293 cells. Our studies demonstrate an important additional route for tyrosine-dependent phosphorylation regulation of BK channels, dependent upon BK channel assembly with cortactin, and further support the hypothesis that phosphorylation-dependent regulation of accessory proteins within the BK channel signaling complex represents an important target for control of BK channel function. HEK293 Cell Culture and TransfectionHEK293 cells, which do not express endogenous BK channels as determined by reverse transcription-PCR, Western blot, and functional analysis, were subcultured essentially as described (4Tian L. Coghill L.S. McClafferty H. MacDonald S.H.F. Antoni F.A. Ruth P. Knaus H.G. Shipston M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11897-11902Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 21Tian L.

Briefly, cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air/5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were passaged every 3–7 days using 0.25% trypsin in Hanks' buffered salt solution containing 0.1% EDTA. For biochemical studies cells were grown to 70–80% confluence in 25- or 75-cm2 flasks. For electrophysiological or imaging assays cells were plated on glass coverslips. Twenty-four hours prior to the experiment cells were washed, and medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing ITS serum replacement (Invitrogen). Cells were transiently transfected at 40–60% confluence with the respective cDNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), essentially as described by the manufacturer. Medium was replaced after 24 h, and assays were performed 48–72 h post transfection. Stable cell lines were also created by selection using 1.0 mg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen). Channel constructs contained a C-terminal hemagglutinin (-HA) epitope tag as previously described (25Chen L. Tian L.J. MacDonald S.H.F. McClafferty H. Hammond M.S.L. Huibant J.M. Ruth P. Knaus H.G. Shipston M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33599-33609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). For the majority of these studies the e22 murine splice variant of the BK channel α-subunit was used (25Chen L. Tian L.J. MacDonald S.H.F. McClafferty H. Hammond M.S.L. Huibant J.M. Ruth P. Knaus H.G. Shipston M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33599-33609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), although identical results were also observed with other variants (see “Results”). The cortactin binding-deficient mutant channel e22-P656:667A and the Src kinase tyrosine phosphorylation mutant e22-Y762F were created by QuikChange II site-direct mutagenesis (Stratagene), and mutation and sequence integrity were confirmed by sequencing. Patch Clamp ElectrophysiologyExperiments were performed by only selecting patches that contained low channel densities. To facilitate this when using stable cell lines, cells were not maintained in selection medium. Single channel current recordings were performed in the inside-out configuration of the patch clamp technique, at room temperature (20–24 °C), using physiological potassium gradients. The pipette solution (extracellular) contained (in mm): 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, 20 glucose, 10 HEPES, pH 7.4. The bath solution (intracellular) contained (in mm): 140 KCl, 5 NaCl, 2 MgCl2, 1 BAPTA, 30 glucose, 10 HEPES, 1 mm ATP, pH 7.3 with free calcium [Ca2+]i buffered to 0.2 μm, unless indicated otherwise. Channel activity was determined during 60-s depolarizations to the voltage indicated in the respective figure legends. For experiments in which [Ca2+]i was buffered to 10 μm, 1 mm dibromo-BAPTA was used as the calcium buffer. Solution exchange, or application of drugs to the intracellular face of patches, was by gravity-driven perfusion (10 volumes of the bath solution (bath volume, 0.5 ml) at a flow rate of 1–2 ml/min). For some experiments drugs were added directly to the bath. Data acquisition and voltage protocols were controlled by an Axopatch 200 B amplifier and pCLAMP9 software (Axon Instruments Inc., Foster City, CA). All recordings were sampled at 10 kHz and filtered at 2 kHz. Channel activity was allowed to stabilize for at least 10 min after patch excision before addition of drugs. BK channel activity was stable for ∼1 h under the recording conditions used (data not shown), in the absence of channel modulators. Single-channel open probability (Po) was derived either from single-channel analysis using pSTAT (Axon Instruments) or WINEDR (Version 2.3.9, J. Dempster, University of Strathclyde, UK) for patches with <4 channels. In the case of patches with >4 channels, an integration-over-baseline algorithm was used using Igor Pro 4.1 (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR). In the latter case, N*Po (number of functional channels × open probability of channel) values were determined as follows. All-point histograms were plotted to obtain the “offset,” i.e. leak current, as well as the single-channel current amplitude from the peak intervals. After subtraction of the offset from the traces these were integrated over 30- to 60-s segments. The integral divided by integration time and single-channel current amplitude gives N*Po. To determine the mean percent (%) change in channel activity after a treatment, in patches with low to moderate levels of channel expression, mean Po or N*Po was measured immediately before and 10 min after the respective drug treatment. Mean change in activity was expressed as a percentage (%) of the pre-treatment control ± S.E. In the respective figure legends and text a positive percentage (%) change in activity reflects activation, whereas a negative percentage (%) change reflects channel inhibition. Cytochalasin D and Latrunculin B (Sigma) were dissolved in Me2SO and used at final bath concentrations of 10 μm and 2 μm, respectively. Me2SO vehicle controls (<0.01% and 0.05%, respectively) had no significant effect on channel activity (not shown). Lavendustin A (Calbiochem) and Lavendustin B (Calbiochem) were dissolved in ethanol, and used at a final concentration of 10 μm. Ethanol concentration was <0.01% and had no significant effect on channel activity (not shown). Sodium orthovanadate (Na3VO4) was activated for maximal inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphatases as previously described (26Gordon J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar) and stored at –20 °C before use at a final concentration of 10 μm. The tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, potassium bisperoxo(1,10-phenanthroline) oxovanadate (u) (bpv(phen)), was dissolved in dH2O immediately prior to use and used at a final concentration of 10 μm. Immunoprecipitation and Western BlottingCells were lysed at 4 °C in buffer containing: 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 10% v/v glycerol, 1% Triton-X-100, and proteinase inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Na3VO4 was added in some experiments as appropriate. Cell lysates were spun and supernatants pre-cleared for 30 min with protein-G beads (Sigma). Lysates were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with the respective antibody and 40 μl of pre-equilibrated protein-G beads. Primary antibodies for immunoprecipitation were as follows: anti-phosphotyrosine (mouse monoclonal, pY99, 1:250, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-cortactin (mouse monoclonal clone 4F11, 1:200, Upstate Biotechnology). Beads were washed a minimum of five times with lysis buffer. Bound complexes were eluted with SDS-sample buffer, separated through a 10% SDS-PAGE gel, and electroblotted to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Blots were probed with a rabbit polyclonal anti-cortactin (cortactin (H-191), 1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or a rabbit polyclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (1:1000, Calbiochem) at 4 °C overnight. After washing blots were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Diagnostics Scotland, UK) for 1 h at room temperature. Signals were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL), and were images captured on a Syngene Genegnome camera system using Genesnap software (Syngene). Phalloidin Staining of Actin CytoskeletonBriefly, HEK293 cells were plated on glass coverslips growing up to 50–70% confluency within 24 h. Cells were first washed twice with pre-warmed phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) then fixed with ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and quenched with 50 mm NH4Cl in PBS for 10 min. Cells were washed three times in ice-cold PBS, permeabilized using 0.1% Triton in PBS at room temperature for 10 min, washed three times, and blocked in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.05% Tween 20 for 1 h. Cells were incubated with Phalloidin-Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate (Molecular Probes) at a concentration of 5 units/ml for 45 min in the dark. After incubation, cells were washed with ice-cold 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS three times before mounting on microscope slides using Mowiol. Confocal images were acquired on a Zeiss LSM510 laser scanning microscope, using a 63× oil Plan Apochromat (numerical aperture = 1.4) objective lens, in multitracking mode to minimize channel cross-talk. Statistical AnalysisAll data are presented as means ± S.E. with n = number of independent experiments and/or patches. Data were analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) with posthoc Student-Newman-Keuls test with significance set at p < 0.01, or by Students paired t test, as appropriate. Closely Associated Endogenous Tyrosine Kinase/Phosphatase Activity Regulates BK ChannelsAs a first step to interrogate the role of endogenous Src family tyrosine kinases, closely associated with BK channels, we selected inside-out patches from HEK293 cells in which BK channels were expressed at low levels to allow analysis at single channel resolution and to reduce the potential saturation of endogenous signaling cascades that may be inherent in highly overexpressing cells in which large (nanoamp) macropatch recordings are routinely analyzed. In excised inside-out patches from HEK293 cells expressing murine BK channels inhibition of endogenous Src family tyrosine kinases with 10 μm lavendustin A resulted in a robust stimulation of BK channel activity in the presence of submicromolar calcium concentrations (Fig. 1). Channel activation was associated with a significant (p < 0.05, paired t test) increase in mean channel open time from 1.21 ± 0.32 ms, n = 7 under control conditions to 2.29 ± 0.79 ms, n = 7 in the presence of lavendustin A. The mean closed time was significantly reduced (p < 0.01, paired t test) from 6.90 ± 0.60 to 4.05 ± 0.74 ms (n = 7). In three patches in which mean channel open probability was determined across a wide voltage range the half-maximal voltage for channel activation (V0.5max) was shifted to the left by lavendustin A by 8.3 ± 2.3 mV with no significant change in the slope of the curves (slope in control 1.76 ± 0.31, in the presence of lavendustin A, 1.64 ± 0.41) suggesting the voltage sensor per se is not altered. The stimulatory effect of lavendustin A did not significantly reverse over 15–20 min in 3/3 patches following washout, in general agreement with the essentially irreversible (reversibility t½ > 100 min) effect of the slow binding inhibition reported for lavendustin A on epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase activity (27Hsu C-Y. J. Persons P.E. Spada A.P. Bednar R.A. Levitzki A. Zilberstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21105-21112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The inactive analog lavendustin B, under identical conditions, had no significant effect on BK channel activity (Fig. 1). This suggests that Src family tyrosine kinase activity closely associated with the channel tonically inhibits BK channels expressed in HEK293 cells, an effect in general agreement with the effect of Src family kinase inhibitors in native cells (1Alioua A. Mahajan A. Nishimaru K. Zarei M.M. Stefani E. Toro L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14560-14565Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 17Xiong Z.G. Burnette E. Cheung D.W. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 290: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 18Stumpff F. Que Y. Boxberger M. Strauss O. Wiederholt M. Invest. Ophthal. Vis. Sci. 1999; 40: 1404-1417PubMed Google Scholar). The stimulatory effect of lavendustin A was independent of the BK channel α-subunit splice variant used as both the zero and e22 splice variants were activated by similar extents (88.5 ± 3.8%, n = 7 and 95.3 ± 8.7%, n = 8 of pre-treatment control, respectively). However, the stimulatory effect was only observed at submicromolar intracellular free calcium concentrations. When intracellular free calcium was buffered to 10 μm, lavendustin A had no significant effect on channel activity at any potential examined (for example in the zero variant, the mean percentage change in activity determined at 10 mV (close to the V0.5max under these conditions) was –6.9 ± 9.4%, n = 4) compared with pre-treatment control. Because inhibition of Src family tyrosine kinase activity in the isolated inside-out patch stimulates BK channel activity this would also suggest that endogenous tyrosine phosphatase activity is also intimately associated with the channel complex to reverse the tonic inhibition mediated by kinase phosphorylation. In support of this idea, the broad-spectrum tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, sodium orthovanadate prevented channel activation upon Src family kinase inhibition by lavendustin A (Fig. 1). Sodium orthovanadate alone had no significant effect on BK channel activity suggesting that the tonic inhibition (Fig. 1C) via closely associated tyrosine kinase is maximal and/or"

Through a functional genomics approach we compared transcript levels in wild-type and zfs1-deficient S. pombe strains; those elevated in the zfs1-deficient strain were examined for the presence of potential tristetraprolin-like binding sites. One such potential target transcript was encoded by arz1, a gene encoding a protein of unknown function that contains armadillo repeats. arz1 mRNA decay was inhibited in the zfs1-deficient strain when it was expressed under the control of a thiamine-repressible promoter. Mutations within one AU-rich element present in the arz1 3′-untranslated region protected this transcript from zfs1-promoted decay, whereas mutating another potential binding site had no effect. Binding assays confirmed a direct interaction between zfs1 and arz1 mRNA-based probes; this interaction was eliminated when key residues were mutated in either zfs1 zinc finger. zfs1 and its targets in S. pombe represent a useful model system for studies of zinc finger protein/AU-rich element interactions that result in mRNA decay.

Examination of the genome of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe revealed only one member of the TTP family, encoded by the zfs1 gene, which has a TZF domain at its C terminus (16Kanoh J. Sugimoto A. Yamamoto M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1185-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). zfs1 is necessary for coordinating septum formation with exit from mitosis (17Beltraminelli N. Murone M. Simanis V. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3103-3114PubMed Google Scholar). zfs1-deficient cells exhibit a reduced rate of cell division, with decreased cell size, and do not respond properly to pheromone (16Kanoh J. Sugimoto A. Yamamoto M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1185-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 17Beltraminelli N. Murone M. Simanis V. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3103-3114PubMed Google Scholar). Pheromone insensitivity can be overcome by overexpression of proteins that control the upstream portion of the pheromone signaling cascade (16Kanoh J. Sugimoto A. Yamamoto M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1185-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To date no specific biochemical function of the zfs1 protein has been demonstrated, but intact zinc fingers are necessary for the biological roles of zfs1 described previously (16Kanoh J. Sugimoto A. Yamamoto M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1185-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). No evidence of DNA or RNA binding has been presented for zfs1. In contrast to S. pombe, Saccharomyces cerevisiae expresses two members of the TTP family, CTH1 and CTH2 (18Thompson M.J. Lai W.S. Taylor G.A. Blackshear P.J. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 174: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 19Puig S. Askeland E. Thiele D.J. Cell. 2005; 120: 99-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Unlike the effects observed with disruption of zfs1 in S. pombe, disruption of either CTH1 or CTH2 had no apparent effect on growth (18Thompson M.J. Lai W.S. Taylor G.A. Blackshear P.J. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 174: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Overexpression of CTH1 or mouse TTP, but not CTH2, in S. cerevisiae reduced growth rates by 50% (18Thompson M.J. Lai W.S. Taylor G.A. Blackshear P.J. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 174: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and increased zfs1 expression in S. pombe resulted in a comparable level of growth reduction after 24 h. CTH2 is important for regulating mRNA stability in response to iron depletion (19Puig S. Askeland E. Thiele D.J. Cell. 2005; 120: 99-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Recent data indicate that zfs1 is not a functional homologue of CTH2 with respect to iron sensitivity (20Mercier A. Pelletier B. Labbe S. Eukaryot. Cell. 2006; 5: 1866-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and S. pombe and S. cerevisiae differ substantially in their mechanisms of iron metabolism (19Puig S. Askeland E. Thiele D.J.

In a microarray study designed to identify transcripts elevated in a zfs1-deficient strain, we identified a previously uncharacterized gene that we have named arz1 (for armadillo-repeat containing zfs1 target 1). We hypothesized that, like TTP and its mammalian family members, zfs1 might function as an ARE-binding, mRNA-destabilizing protein. We show that zfs1 can bind specifically to AREs within the arz1 mRNA 3′-UTR in a zinc finger-dependent fashion, and stimulate the rate of arz1 mRNA decay in intact cells. These data suggest that this system holds promise for more detailed biochemical investigations of the mechanisms of action of this protein family, as well as the physiological function of zfs1 in this organism. Yeast Strains—A S. pombe zfs1-deficient strain was used in a direct comparison with a representative wild-type strain, which was originally used as the background cell type for zfs1 gene targeting (17Beltraminelli N. Murone M. Simanis V. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3103-3114PubMed Google Scholar). These strains were gifts from Dr. Viesturs Simanis (École Polytechnique Fédérale De Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland). Strains were grown at 30 °C in Edinburgh minimal medium (EMM) supplemented with 50 mg/liter of adenine, histidine, leucine, lysine, and uracil each (EMM+5S) or with SP minus Leu (EMM+4S-Leu) when transformed (media and supplements were purchased from Q-biogene, Morgan, CA). Steady-state Comparison of S. pombe Strains by Microarray—S. pombe wild-type and zfs1-deficient strains were grown to 1.0 A600 in EMM+5S at 30 °C for steady-state analysis. Total cellular RNA was prepared from four replicate cultures. For these and all other cultures in this study, cells from 1.5 ml of culture were centrifuged at 16,100 × g for 1 min at room temperature, and total RNA was harvested from the cell pellet after storage at–80 °C using the MasterPure yeast RNA purification kit (Epicenter, Madison, WI). Gene expression analysis was conducted using Yeast Genome 2.0 GeneChip® arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) containing both S. cerevisiae and S. pombe probe sets. RNA (1 μg) was amplified using the Affymetrix One-Cycle cDNA Synthesis protocol. For each array, 5 μg of amplified biotin-cRNAs was fragmented and hybridized to the array for 16 h at 45 °C in a rotating hybridization oven using the Affymetrix Eukaryotic Target Hybridization Controls and protocol. Slides were stained with streptavidin/phycoerythrin using a double-antibody staining procedure and washed utilizing the Mini_euk2v3 protocol of the Affymetrix Fluidics Station FS450 for antibody amplification. Arrays were scanned with an Affymetrix Scanner 3000, and data were obtained using the GeneChip® operating software. The resulting files (.dat, .cel, and .chp) were imported into the Rosetta Resolver system, and the S. cerevisiae probe sets were masked out prior to data preprocessing and error modeling (22Weng L.

Open table in a new tab S. pombe Iron Depletion—Wild-type S. pombe was grown in EMM+5S from ∼0.1 A600 to log phase at 30 °C (reached ∼1.0 A600 at 20 h) in the presence (treatment) or absence (control) of 750 μm ferrozine (Sigma), an iron chelator, following an approach used for S. cerevisiae (19Puig S. Askeland E. Thiele D.J. Cell. 2005; 120: 99-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). 5 μg of total cellular RNA was used for Northern analysis (see below) of zfs1 transcript levels. Northern Analyses—arz1-, zfs1-, and actin-specific probes were generated by PCR using gene-specific primers (Table 2), and 50 ng of each probe fragment was used for random-primed labeling with a High Prime kit (Roche Applied Science) to incorporate [α-32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The actin control was used to examine loading consistency, in combination with gel staining using acridine orange, and for quantitative correction during PhosphorImager densitometric evaluation (ImageQuaNT 5.1, Molecular Dynamics, GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). S. pombe wild-type and zfs1-deficient strains were grown to 1.0 A600 in EMM+5S at 30 °C for steady-state analysis. A total of 5 μg of total cellular RNA was used in each gel lane for all Northern analyses, following standard methods (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F.M. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar). W1 and Z1 transformant strains were grown to 1.0 A600 in 30 ml of EMM+4S-Leu. A time “0” sample (1.5 ml of culture) was first collected, and the cell suspension was centrifuged at 16,100 × g for 1 min at room temperature, after which the pellet was frozen in liquid N2. Thiamine (10 μm final concentration) was then added to the cultures. These were then sampled such that pellets were frozen at 10, 20, and 40 min after thiamine addition. A second screen focused on 4-min time points (4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 min) was carried out in an effort to determine the half-life of the arz1 mRNA in the W1 and Z1 transformant strains. Cell pellets of transformants were used for total cellular RNA isolation and Northern analysis. Endogenous mRNA control samples were evaluated in direct comparison with each set of transformant strain comparisons and used for correction during quantification of nmt/arz1-expressed mRNA. Total cellular RNA from W1, MuA, MuB, B1, B2, or CCC mutant nmt/arz1 constructs was compared directly to RNA from Z1 by Northern analysis. Direct comparisons of the four samples were performed following the same protocol used for the initial W1 and Z1 initial time-course comparisons. Northern blots were washed extensively with two final washes at 60 °C in 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS before exposure to film or phosphorimaging screens. Blots were exposed to phosphorimaging screens for 2–3 h, and these were scanned using the Typhoon system (Molecular Dynamics, GE Healthcare) and analyzed using ImageQuaNT and GraphPad (San Diego, CA) Prism, version 4. All graphs show paired comparisons using Students t test (for direct comparison of individual means) or one-way analysis of variance (used for comparisons of multiple means), and error bars indicate standard deviations. zfs1 Protein Production and RNA Gel Shift Assays—The zfs1 coding region was PCR-amplified using primers F6 and R6 (Table 2), containing SspI and SpeI restriction sites, respectively, for cloning into restriction enzyme-digested expression vector. A PCR-derived restriction digest fragment was cloned into an expression vector LacZ promoter upstream of the maltose-binding protein (MBP) coding sequence (cytoplasmic) along with a tetracycline resistance cassette (AstraZeneca, Wilmington, DE). The expression construct was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) containing a TF16 (trigger factor) expression construct and a chloramphenicol resistance cassette. A clone bearing both expression constructs was grown in selective medium at 37 °C to 0.4 A600. Expression of TF16 was induced by the addition of 1 ml of 0.5 g/ml l-arabinose for 1 h, followed by induction and expression of the MBP/zfs1 construct with 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside for 20 h at 18 °C (shaking at 200 rpm). Cultures were chilled on ice, and cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C and then lysed in 40 ml of cold Buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100) by ultrasonication. The cellular debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then applied to 5 g of amylose resin (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) that had been washed with Buffer A in preparation for batch method purification in a 50-ml polypropylene tube, following the manufacturer's protocol. Approximately 30 mg of protein was obtained (5–6 mg/ml) from the amylose resin. Protein concentrations were assessed using the BCA protein assay (Pierce) and were confirmed by SDS-PAGE, using albumin as a standard, and purity was estimated at >90% by SDS-PAGE Coomassie Blue staining. Site-directed mutants of the MBP/zfs1 construct were made (29Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4894) Google Scholar), using primer pairs Fzfs1C and Rzfs1C, and Fzfs1H and Fzfs1H (Table 3), that would change Cys-370 to Gly (C370G) and His-351 to Ile (H351I), respectively, using the amino acid numbering system in NCBI accession number CAB75997.1, which we predicted would eliminate RNA binding based on previous studies in mammalian family members (3Lai W.S. Carballo E. Strum J.R. Kennington E.A. Phillips R.S. Blackshear P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4311-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar) and homology modeling presented in Fig. 5. Recombinant mutant proteins were expressed and purified using the same strategy that was used for the wild-type MBP/zfs1 protein and for MBP alone. The C370G and H351I amino acid mutant proteins yielded ∼24 mg and 18 mg of total protein, respectively. Single-stranded RNA oligonucleotides were obtained from Invitrogen that represented the arz1 AREa and AREb sequences, as well as binding site mutants of each of these sequences (Table 4). A human tumor necrosis factor-α ARE-based oligonucleotide of comparable length was also tested in gel shift assays (Table 4). Each oligonucleotide was end-labeled with [32P]pCp at the 3′-end using T4 RNA ligase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). Approximately 100 fmol of each probe (1 × 104 cpm) was used per reaction in binding experiments.TABLE 4RNA oligonucleotides used in this studyProbeSequence (5′ → 3′)aBold bases indicate those considered mutated compared to the normal arz1 sequences (AREa and AREb).NCBI accession numberLengthb TNFα UUAUUUAUUAUUUAUUUAUUAUUUAUUAB103618.127 AREa UAUUGCUAAUUAUUUAUUUUUUCGAUUANC_003421.228 AREa mutant UAUUGCUAAUUCUUUCUUUUUUCGAUUANC_003421.228 AREb CUUAUUUAUUACCAUUAAUUAUUUAUUUNC_003421.228 B1 mutant CUUCUUUCUUACCAUUAAUUAUUUAUUUNC_003421.228 B2 mutant CUUAUUUAUUACCAUUAAUUCUUUCUUUNC_003421.228 AREb mutant CUUCUUUCUUACCAUUAAUUCUUUCUUUNC_003421.228a Bold bases indicate those considered mutated compared to the normal arz1 sequences (AREa and AREb).

https://openalex.org/W2011158849,"Background Pten functionally acts as a tumor suppressor gene. Lately, tissue-specific ablation of Pten gene in mice has elucidated the role of Pten in different tumor progression models. However, a temporally controlled Pten loss in all adult tissues to examine susceptibility of various tissues to Pten-deficient tumorigenesis has not been addressed yet. Our goal was to explore the genesis of Pten-deficient malignancies in multiple tissue lineages of the adult mouse. Methods and Findings We utilized an inducible Cre/loxP system to delete Pten exon 5 in the systemic organs of ROSA26 (R26)-CreERT;Ptenfx/fx mice. On reaching 45 weeks 4OHT-induced Pten loss, we found that the R26-CreERT;Ptenfx/fx mice developed a variety of malignancies. Overall tumor mean latency was 17 weeks in the Pten-deficient mice. Interestingly, mutant females developed malignancies more quickly at 10∼11 weeks compared with a tumor latency of 21 weeks for mutant males. Lymphoma incidence (76.9% in females; 40.0% in males) was higher than the other malignancies found in the mutant mice. Mutant males developed prostate (20.0%), intestinal cancer (35.0%) and squamous cell carcinoma (10.0%), whereas the mutant females developed squamous cell carcinoma (15.4%) and endometrial cancer (46.1%) in addition to lymphomas. Furthermore, we tested the pharmacological inhibition of the PTEN downstream effectors using LY294002 on Pten-deficient prostate hyperplasia. Our data revealed that, indeed, the prostate hyperplasia resulting from the induced Pten loss was significantly suppressed by LY294002 (p = 0.007). Conclusions Through monitoring a variety of Pten-deficient tumor formation, our results revealed that the lymphoid lineages and the epithelium of the prostate, endometrium, intestine and epidermis are highly susceptible to tumorigenesis after the Pten gene is excised. Therefore, this R26-CreERT; Ptenfx/fx mouse model may provide an entry point for understanding the role of Pten in the tumorigenesis of different organs and extend the search for potential therapeutic approaches to prevent Pten-deficient malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W2002836340,"Background The human herpes simplex virus (HSV) host cell factor HCF-1 is a transcriptional coregulator that associates with both histone methyl- and acetyltransferases, and a histone deacetylase and regulates cell proliferation and division. In HSV-infected cells, HCF-1 associates with the viral protein VP16 to promote formation of a multiprotein–DNA transcriptional activator complex. The ability of HCF proteins to stabilize this VP16-induced complex has been conserved in diverse animal species including Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans suggesting that VP16 targets a conserved cellular function of HCF-1. Methodology/Principal Findings To investigate the role of HCF proteins in animal development, we have characterized the effects of loss of the HCF-1 homolog in C. elegans, called Ce HCF-1. Two large hcf-1 deletion mutants (pk924 and ok559) are viable but display reduced fertility. Loss of Ce HCF-1 protein at reduced temperatures (e.g., 12°C), however, leads to a high incidence of embryonic lethality and early embryonic mitotic and cytokinetic defects reminiscent of mammalian cell-division defects upon loss of HCF-1 function. Even when viable, however, at normal temperature, mutant embryos display reduced levels of phospho-histone H3 serine 10 (H3S10P), a modification implicated in both transcriptional and mitotic regulation. Mammalian cells with defective HCF-1 also display defects in mitotic H3S10P status. Conclusions/Significance These results suggest that HCF-1 proteins possess conserved roles in the regulation of cell division and mitotic histone phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W2013483677,"Large numbers of protein expression changes are usually observed in mouse models for neurodegenerative diseases, even when only a single gene was mutated in each case. To study the effect of gene dose alterations on the cellular proteome, we carried out a proteomic investigation on murine embryonic stem cells that either overexpressed individual genes or displayed aneuploidy over a genomic region encompassing 14 genes. The number of variant proteins detected per cell line ranged between 70 and 110, and did not correlate with the number of modified genes. In cell lines with single gene mutations, up and down-regulated proteins were always in balance in comparison to parental cell lines regarding number as well as concentration of differentially expressed proteins. In contrast, dose alteration of 14 genes resulted in an unequal number of up and down-regulated proteins, though the balance was kept at the level of protein concentration. We propose that the observed protein changes might partially be explained by a proteomic network response. Hence, we hypothesize the existence of a class of “balancer” proteins within the proteomic network, defined as proteins that buffer or cushion a system, and thus oppose multiple system disturbances. Through database queries and resilience analysis of the protein interaction network, we found that potential balancer proteins are of high cellular abundance, possess a low number of direct interaction partners, and show great allelic variation. Moreover, balancer proteins contribute more heavily to the network entropy, and thus are of high importance in terms of system resilience. We propose that the “elasticity” of the proteomic regulatory network mediated by balancer proteins may compensate for changes that occur under diseased conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1999493308,"In the heme-based sensor Dos from Escherichia coli, the ferrous heme is coordinated by His-77 and Met-95. The latter residue is replaced upon oxygen binding or oxidation of the heme. Here we investigate the early signaling processes upon dissociation of the distal ligand using ultrafast spectroscopy and site-directed mutagenesis. Geminate CO rebinding to the heme domain DosH appears insensitive to replacement of Met-95, in agreement with the notion that this residue is oriented out of the heme pocket in the presence of external ligands. A uniquely slow 35-ps phase in rebinding of the flexible methionine side chain after dissociation from ferrous DosH is completely abolished in rebinding of the more rigid histidine side chain in the M95H mutant protein, where only the 7-ps phase, common to all 6-coordinate heme proteins, is observed. Temperature-dependence studies indicate that all rebinding of internal and external ligands is essentially barrierless, but that CfigsO escape from the heme pocket is an activated process. Solvent viscosity studies combined with molecular dynamics simulations show that there are two configurations in the ferrous 6-coordinate protein, involving two isomers of the Met-95 side chain, of which the structural changes extend to the solvent-exposed backbone, which is part of the flexible FG loop. One of these configurations has considerable motional freedom in the Met-95-dissociated state.

In particular, heme-based sensor proteins have been identified in which the exchange of an internal ligand and an external signaling molecule at the heme binding site leads to changes in the activity of an associated enzymatic domain. 6-coordinate 5-coordinate wild type. 6-coordinate 5-coordinate wild type. Dos from Escherichia coli is such a heme-based sensor protein. It is composed of a heme domain of known structure, DosH (7Kurokawa H. Lee D-S. Watanabe M. Sagami I. Mikami B. Raman C.S. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20186-20193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 8Park H. Suquet C. Satterlee J.D. Kang C. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2738-2746Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), and a phosphodiesterase domain. The former contains a b-type heme and is coordinated by histidine (His-77) and methionine (Met-95) in the ferrous unliganded form (Fig. 1). Small gaseous molecules like CO, NO, and O2 can replace Met-95. As DosH shows high sequence similarity with the heme domain of the oxygen sensor FixL (which by contrast possesses a 5-coordinate (5-c) heme in the ferrous unliganded form), it was proposed to be a direct oxygen-sensing domain as well (2Delgado-Nixon V.M. Gonzalez G. Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2685-2691Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). However, in the ferric form the heme binds a H2O molecule, and the activity of the holoprotein with cyclic AMP as substrate strongly decreases upon oxidation. Consequently, Dos has also been proposed to act as a redox sensor (9Sasakura Y. Hirata S. Sugiyama S. Suzuki S. Taguchi S. Watanabe M. Matsui T. Sagami I. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23821-23827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Very recently, a role as a general gas sensor has also been put forward on the basis of moderate up-regulation of activity by CO, NO, and O2 with cyclic diGMP as substrate (10Takahashi H. Shimizu T. Chem. Lett. 2006; 35: 970-971Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and a crucial role of Met-95 in this regulation has been demonstrated (11Tanaka A. Takahashi H. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 21301-21307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The ligand-induced up-regulation in Dos contrasts with the O2-induced inactivation of kinase activity in FixL. In the ferrous form of the heme, the ligand at the 6th position is photolabile. This is the case for the small diatomic gaseous ligands (12Petrich J.W. Poyart C. Martin J-L. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4049-4060Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 13Ye X. Demidov A.

In both systems, the attachment to the protein backbone keeps the dissociated internal residue close to the heme cofactor so that it fully recombines with heme in a monoexponential way in ∼6 ps. The early dynamics of ligands in wild-type (WT) DosH are unusual in several aspects (20Liebl U. Bouzhir-Sima L. Kiger L. Marden M.C. Lambry J-C. Négrerie M. Vos M.H. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6527-6535Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). First, in contrast to the above examples, the dissociated methionine recombines in a clearly biexponential way: not only was a 7-ps phase observed as in other systems but also an additional slower phase of ∼35 ps with similar amplitude. Because dissociation of methionine must be the initial step changing the activity in the holoprotein from that associated with the unliganded reduced form to that associated with external ligand (or to that of the oxidized water-bound form in the case of redox sensing), this finding opens the exciting perspective that several steps in the early signaling pathway can be followed. Second, the dynamics of external ligands has particular characteristics, and points at a restrained heme pocket. Apart from O2 recombination, which predominantly occurs within ∼5 ps as in FixLH (21Liebl U. Bouzhir-Sima L. Négrerie M. Martin J-L. Vos M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The present work aims at exploring the possibility of monitoring initial signaling events in DosH, and the role of the relatively flexible side chain of the crucial methionine 95 residue, by combining site-directed mutagenesis, femtosecond spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations. Early site-directed mutagenesis studies have identified Met-95 as the displaceable axial residue in 6-c reduced DosH (23Gonzalez G. Dioum E.M. Bertolucci C.M. Tomita T. Ikeda-Saito M. Cheesman M.R.

These findings also indicate that in the absence of Met-95, no other residue occupies the binding site. This contrasts with cytochrome c, where replacement of the methionine ligand can lead to the coordination of closely located lysine residues (26Silkstone G. Stanway G. Brzezinski P. Wilson M.T. Biophys. Chem. 2002; 98: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In DosH, replacement of Met-95 by histidine leads to a bis-histidine 6-c form (24Sato A. Sasakura Y. Sugiyama S. Sagami I.

This loop has been implicated in intra-protein signal propagation toward the enzymatic domain, both in the ferrous deoxy to oxy transition (2Delgado-Nixon V.M. Gonzalez G.

Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20186-20193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In the present study we compare WT DosH with M95I and M95H mutant proteins. Isoleucine, the corresponding residue in FixL (23Gonzalez G. Dioum E.M. Bertolucci C.M. Tomita T. Ikeda-Saito M. Cheesman M.R. Watmough N.J. Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8414-8421Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), has a volume similar to methionine and cannot form a bond with the heme. Histidine does bind to the heme but has a less flexible side chain. DNA Manipulations, Protein Expression, and Purification—Chromosomal DNA from E. coli HB101 was isolated following standard protocols. The DNA fragment corresponding to codons 1-152 from E. coli yddU (renamed dos (2Delgado-Nixon V.M. Gonzalez G. Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2685-2691Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar)), coding for the oxygen-sensing PAS domain (DosH), was amplified using the primers 5′-ATG AAG CTA ACC GAT GCG GAT A-3′ (forward) and 5′-C GAC CGA CCG GTG ATT GTC CTC-3′ (reverse) and cloned into a pCRT7/NT cloning vector (Invitrogen) under control of an isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyrano-side-inducible T7 promoter. The recombinant gene fragment corresponding to the Dos heme domain in E. coli was used as template for site-directed mutagenesis reactions. The substitutions M95I and M95H were introduced following the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene) by replacing the codon ATG by ATC and CAC, respectively. All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing prior to further analysis. The final constructs were transformed into E. coli strain BL21DE3 for expression. Protein expression and purification were performed as described in a previous study (20Liebl U. Bouzhir-Sima L. Kiger L. Marden M.C. Lambry J-C. Négrerie M. Vos M.H. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6527-6535Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Sample Preparation—The proteins were prepared to a sample concentration of 50-70 μm in a gastight optical cell, in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Ferrous deoxy-DosH was prepared by degassing the sample and reducing it with sodium dithionite. To obtain the CO-bound form, it was subsequently equilibrated with 1 atm of CO gas. For the O2- and NO-bound form, samples were degassed, reduced with sodium ascorbate and equilibrated with 1 atm of O2 or 0.01 atm of NO, respectively. For the experiments in the presence of glycerol, concentrated reduced and degassed DosH solutions were mixed in the sample cell with degassed glycerol. Spectroscopy—Steady-state spectra were recorded using a Shimadzu UV-visible 1601 spectrophotometer. Multicolor femtosecond absorption spectroscopy (27Martin J-L. Vos M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 232: 416-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) was performed with a 30-fs pump pulse centered at 565 nm and a <30 fs white light continuum probe pulse, at a repetition rate of 30 Hz. Multiple time window acquisition schemes were used, with windows ranging from 4 ps to 4 ns full scale. Unless otherwise indicated the experiments were performed at 20 °C; for some experiments the sample holder was thermostatted in the range of 8-40 °C. For most experiments the sample was continuously moved perpendicular to the beams to ensure sample renewal between subsequent pulse pairs. This was not the case for the experiments comparing reduced unliganded glycerol-containing samples (which could not be fully homogenized) with aqueous solutions. It was verified, however, that for the buffer-only samples, the kinetics values for each were identical with and without movement. Molecular Dynamics Simulation—A model of the Dos heme domain was constructed using the structure from PDB file code 1V9Z (7Kurokawa H. Lee D-S. Watanabe M. Sagami I. Mikami B. Raman C.S. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20186-20193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) with the molecular modeling program CHARMM32 (28Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comput. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-212Crossref Scopus (13767) Google Scholar). Two identical polypeptide chains of 113 residues (amino acid 20-132), 2 hemes, 196 water molecules from the structure, and 1411 additional water molecules composed the model. Hydrogen atoms were added using the CHARMM HBUILD command and a relative dielectric constant equal to unity was applied to the entire structure. The heme iron atom was bonded to the His-77 Nϵ2 and Met-95 Sδ. For the trajectories shown, the bond length and force constant for the latter bond were taken to be those used previously for cytochrome c (29Autenrieth F. Tajkhorshid E. Baudry J. Luthey-Schulten Z. J. Comp. Chem. 2004; 25: 1613-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). For comparison, a model was also used with a weaker bond (30 kcal/mol/Å2), consistent with density functional theory calculations of the iron protoporphyrin-imidazole-dimethyl sulfide system, that we performed. Non-bonded interactions were shifted to zero between 8 and 14 Å. The energy of the structure was minimized with SD and ABNR algorithms, and the temperature of the model was raised to 300 K over 30 ps in 30 steps of 10K. A 300-ps equilibration phase, with atomic velocities assignment randomly chosen in a Boltzmann distribution at 300 K each picosecond, was applied to the model. A 650-ps free dynamics trajectory was then performed. This trajectory was used to generate different initial structural conditions before suppression of the heme-Met-95 bond. The root mean square deviation of backbone atoms from the PDB structure remains <1.2 Å. Dissociation of Met-95 from heme was simulated by suppression of the Met-95 Sδ-heme iron-bonded interactions and switching to a five coordinate heme parameter set. Three 500-ps dissociation simulations were performed. The model structure was saved each picosecond for further analysis. Steady-state Spectroscopy of DosH Mutant Proteins—Fig. 2 shows steady-state spectra of ferrous deoxy-WT, M95I, and M95H DosH. These are in agreement with previously published spectra (2Delgado-Nixon V.M. Gonzalez G. Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2685-2691Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 23Gonzalez G. Dioum E.M. Bertolucci C.M. Tomita T. Ikeda-Saito M. Cheesman M.R. Watmough N.J.

Biochem. 2003; 270: 4771-4779Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), demonstrating that the M95I mutant is 5-c, whereas M95H is 6-c, as WT DosH. Fig. 2 also outlines the spectral choices for pump-probe spectroscopy, with excitation in the α band and probing in the Soret band, where large differences between 5-c and 6-c species are observed. The spectra of the carboxylated complexes are very similar for all three complexes and typical for 6-c CO complexes (not shown). Internal Ligand Rebinding in DosH—Ferrous deoxy-M95I DosH is 5-c. Excitation of this species leads to spectral changes (not shown) very similar to those observed in deoxymyoglobin (30Vos M.H. Lambry J-C. Martin J.-L. J. Chin. Chem. Soc. 2000; 47: 765-768Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and deoxy-FixLH (21Liebl U. Bouzhir-Sima L. Négrerie M. Martin J-L. Vos M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12771-12776Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). They evolve with time constants up to ∼3 ps, which can be understood in terms of excited-state photophysics (12Petrich J.W. Poyart C. Martin J-L. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4049-4060Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 31Franzen S. Kiger L. Poyart C. Martin J-L. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 2372-2385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 compares transient spectra and kinetics of ferrous deoxy-M95H and WT DosH. The shape of the transient spectra is very similar and is attributed to dissociated His-95 and Met-95, respectively. However, the rebinding is clearly much faster in the mutant protein than in WT. In WT DosH the kinetics are biexponential, with time constants of 7.2 and 35 ps and similar amplitudes (20Liebl U. Bouzhir-Sima L. Kiger L. Marden M.C. Lambry J-C. Négrerie M. Vos M.H. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6527-6535Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The rebinding kinetics in M95H DosH are single exponential, with a time constant of 7.6 ps, close to that of the fastest phase in WT (and to that found in other 6-c heme proteins). Thus, it appears that the biexponential kinetics observed in WT are specific for dissociated methionine. We note that both in M95H and WT DosH a small long-lived spectral feature remains that does not reflect formation of a 5-c ferrous species, but rather a few percent of heme-oxidation (20Liebl U. Bouzhir-Sima L. Kiger L. Marden M.C. Lambry J-C. Négrerie M. Vos M.H. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6527-6535Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This feature is not observed upon photoexcitation of the 5-c M95I mutant. External Ligand Rebinding—The kinetics of CO rebinding in WT DosH is unusual in that ∼60% of dissociated CO rebinds to the heme on the nanosecond timescale, prior to leaving the protein (20Liebl U. Bouzhir-Sima L. Kiger L. Marden M.C. Lambry J-C. Négrerie M. Vos M.H. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6527-6535Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This implies that direct rebinding of dissociated CO effectively competes with its migration out of the heme pocket. Fig. 4 shows that, whereas small but significant changes in the CO rebinding kinetics are observed upon replacement of Met-95 by isoleucine or histidine, the WT characteristics do not strongly change. In particular, we note that the kinetics in the M95I mutant does not resemble the kinetics observed in FixLH (where very little decay occurs 4We previously reported that CO dissociated from WT FixLH does not recombine with heme up to 4 ns (20Liebl U. Bouzhir-Sima L. Kiger L. Marden M.C. Lambry J-C. Négrerie M. Vos M.H. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6527-6535Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Recent improvements in the alignment procedure of the delay line have allowed assessing that in fact a small (∼10%) recombination in ∼400 ps does occur. ), which has isoleucine at the equivalent position in wild type (23Gonzalez G. Dioum E.M. Bertolucci C.M. Tomita T. Ikeda-Saito M. Cheesman M.R. Watmough N.J. Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8414-8421Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). All kinetics could be reasonably described by a fit to a monoexponential decay and an asymptotic value (see Table 1 for fit parameters). These findings indicate that the residue in position 95 does not strongly influence the heme pocket volume and surface when it is replaced by an external ligand.TABLE 1Fit parameters of CO rebinding kinetics at 20 °CτAnsDosH WT1.60.64DosH M95H1.40.56DosH M95I1.60.68 Open table in a new tab Transient absorption experiments on the oxycomplexes of the DosH M95I and M95H mutant proteins gave very similar results to those of the WT protein (21Liebl U.

A. 2002; 99: 12771-12776Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), indicating a very low yield of dissociated oxygen on the timescale of a few picoseconds. Similar observations have been made in FixLH (21Liebl U. Bouzhir-Sima L. Négrerie M. Martin J-L. Vos M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12771-12776Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 22Kruglik S.G. Jasaitis A. Hola K. Yamashita T. Liebl U. Martin J-L. Vos M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 7408-7413Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Temperature Dependence Studies—The unusual kinetics of CO rebinding provides a unique opportunity to investigate potential activation barriers involved in CO rebinding from the heme pocket and in migration out of the heme pocket, by determined the temperature dependence. Fig. 5A shows that the overall decay increases moderately with decreasing temperature, with both the rate and relative amplitude of the decay phase varying. This indicates that thermodynamic barriers are involved in the CO dynamics. We analyzed these data in terms of Scheme 1, Fe-CO←k1(Fe...CO)I→k2(Fe......CO)IISCHEME 1 where (Fe...CO)I represents the initial flash-populated dissociated state, with CO close to the heme iron, Fe-CO is the CO-bound state, and (Fe.......CO)II is a state where CO has moved away of the heme environment, toward the solvent. The observed normalized kinetics of the total dissociated state are of the form, Ae-kt + (1 - A). Hence k = k1 + k2 and A = k1/k2, so that we can relate the measured parameters k and A to the intrinsic rate constants k1 and k2 as in Equations 1 and 2. k1=Ak(Eq. 1) k2=(1-A)k(Eq. 2) Fig. 5B shows an Arrhenius plot of both rates k1 and k2. It is clear that the temperature dependence of the kinetics arises essentially from a decrease of k2 with temperature. Thus CO migration out of the heme pocket has an enthalpy barrier of 45 meV (1.0 kcal/mol) ± 10 meV, and CO rebinding to the heme (with a time constant of ∼2.8 ns) appears essentially barrierless. Similar experiments were performed for reduced DosH without external ligands (Fig. 6A). In this case it was found that the kinetics of methionine rebinding to the heme did not change within experimental error in the investigated temperature range. Thus, both rebinding phases are essentially barrierless. Similarly, the rebinding kinetics of His-95 to the heme in the M95H mutant was found to be temperature-independent (not shown). Glycerol Effect—To investigate the influence of the environment of the heme domain on the dynamics of dissociated methionine and to be able to discriminate between different models of interconversion and rebinding of the two methionine-dissociated states (see “Discussion”), we determined the effect of the solvent viscosity on the dynamics of reduced DosH by varying the glycerol concentration. The overall rebinding kinetics increases speed with glycerol concentration (Fig. 6B). Analysis of the kinetic traces indicates that, as with temperature, the rates are independent of glycerol concentration (Fig. 6B, inset). However, the relative amplitudes of the phases do vary: the fast phase increases with glycerol concentration (Fig. 6B). This suggests that two distinct configurations of methionine can be adopted directly after its dissociation from the heme, the probability of adopting either configuration being solvent-dependent, but the interconversion rate not (see “Discussion”). For comparison, the effect of varying the glycerol concentration on the rebinding kinetics of NO and CO was also determined. For NO, full geminate recombination was observed with a main phase of 5 ps (85%) and a minor phase of 20 ps (20Liebl U. Bouzhir-Sima L. Kiger L. Marden M.C. Lambry J-C. Négrerie M. Vos M.H. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6527-6535Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), without significant escape from the heme vicinity. This kinetics does not alter significantly when 60% glycerol is present (not shown). This observation is consistent with previous observations on other heme proteins that the time constant of the fastest phase of geminate NO recombination is independent of glycerol concentration (32Franzen S. Jasaitis A. Belyea J. Brewer S.H. Casey R. MacFarlane IV A.W. Stanley R.J. Vos M.H. Martin J-L. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2006; 110: 14483-14493Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 33Shreve A.P. Franzen S. Simpson M.C. Dyer R.B. J. Phys. Chem. B. 1999; 103: 7969-7975Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and supports the idea that these phases reflect predominantly barrierless rebinding. By contrast, geminate recombination of CO, which is incomplete and occurs on a much longer timescale, does depend on glycerol concentration (Fig. 5C). With increasing viscosity, the overall rebinding becomes faster, which is generally consistent with previous studies on NO rebinding in other heme proteins (32Franzen S. Jasaitis A. Belyea J.

VEK-30 does not interact with this same region of mouse (m)Pg, despite the high conservation of the mK2- and hK2-LBS. To identify the molecular basis for the species specificity of this interaction, hPg and mPg variants were generated, including an hPg chimera with the mK2 sequence and an mPg chimera containing the hK2 sequence. The binding of synthetic VEK-30 to these variants was studied by surface plasmon resonance. The data revealed that, in otherwise intact Pg, the species specificity of VEK-30 binding in these two cases is entirely dictated by two K2 residues that are different between hPg and mPg, namely, Arg-220 of hPg, which is a Gly in mPg, and Leu-222 of hPg, which is a Pro in mPg, neither of which are members of the canonical K2-LBS. Neither the activation of hPg, nor the enzymatic activity of its activated product, plasmin (hPm), are compromised by replacing these two amino acids by their murine counterparts. It is also demonstrated that hPg is more susceptible to activation to hPm after complexation with VEK-30 and that this property is greatly reduced as a result of the R220G and L222P replacements in hPg. These mechanisms for accumulation of protease activity on GAS likely contribute to the virulence of PAM+-GAS strains and identify targets for new therapeutic interventions.

Haemost. 2002; 87: 22-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Much of this functional diversity is revealed by the nature of the ligands that interact with Pg, especially via the constitutive kringle (K) motifs of the latent noncatalytic chain of this protein. All Pg proteins that have been studied contain five consecutive highly homologous kringle domains (1Sottrup-Jensen L. Claeys H. Zajdel M. Petersen T.E. Magnusson S. Prog. Chem. Fibrinolysis Thrombolysis. 1978; 3: 191-209Google Scholar), which can be roughly classified by the strength of their interactions with lysine, and analogues thereof, e.g. ϵ-aminocaproic acid (5Menhart N.

Important functional consequences accrue when Pg/Pm interacts with other proteins. For example, the binding of Pm, through its lysine-binding kringle domains, with degrading fibrin clots, wherein COOH-terminal Lys/Arg residues are liberated, further enhances the degradation of fibrin via plasminolysis (9Fleury V. Gurewich V. Angles-Cano E. Fibrinolysis. 1993; 7: 87-96Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 10Fleury V. Loyau S. Lijnen H.R. Nieuwenhuizen W. Angles-Cano E. Eur. J.

Also, the binding of Pg to COOH-terminal lysine residues of degrading fibrin stimulates its activation to Pm by fibrin-bound tissue-type plasminogen activator, and this represents a major pathophysiological pathway of activation of the fibrinolytic system by tissue-type plasminogen activator (11de Vries C.

In addition, the lysine-binding properties of Pg/Pm kringle regions results in localization of Pg/Pm on cell receptors (12Miles L.A. Dahlberg C.M. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11928-11934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with concomitant development of cell-surface proteolytic capabilities that are important to a number of extracellular-related processes, e.g. extracellular matrix degradation, tumor cell invasion and metastasis, and wound healing (13Miles L.A. Hawley S.B. Baik N. Andronicos N.M. Castellino F.J. Parmer R.J. Front. Biosci. 2005; 10: 1754-1762PubMed Google Scholar). The cellular binding properties of Pg/Pm are also critical for bacterial pathogenesis, and Pg receptors are present on a number of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including Gram-positive group A streptococcus (GAS) (14Lottenberg R. Broder C.C. Boyle M.D. Infect. Immun. 1987; 55: 1914-1918Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a strain that is a major cause of skin and mucosal infections in humans (15Carapetis J.R. Steer A.C. Mulholland E.K. Weber M. Lancet Infect Dis. 2005; 5: 685-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1920) Google Scholar). Similar results have also been published for Pg binding and activation to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (16Monroy V. Amador A. Ruiz B. Espinoza-Cueto P. Xolalpa W. Mancilla R. Espitia C. Infec. Immun. 2000; 68: 4327-4330Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In the case of GAS, human (h)Pg interacts with high affinity, through its lysine binding sites (LBS), to the Pg-binding group-A M-like protein (PAM) of GAS and is activated to Pm by streptokinase (SK), which is produced by this GAS strain. This provides Pm as a source of the cell surface protease activity of the bacteria that allows its penetration into surrounding tissue (17Sodeinde O.A. Subrahmanyam Y.V. Stark K. Quan T. Bao Y. Goguen J.D. Science. 1992; 258: 1004-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 18Wistedt A.C. Ringdahl U. Mulleresterl W. Sjobring U. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 569-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). VEK-30 is a 30-residue internal polypeptide of PAM that contains most of its N-terminal a1 and a2 repeats, but does not possess a COOH-terminal Lys residue. Binding determinants of the PAM-hPg interaction are recapitulated by VEK-30 and the K2 domain of Pg, normally a very weak lysine-binding kringle (19Wistedt A.C. Kotarsky H. Marti D. Ringdahl U. Castellino F.J. Schaller J. Sjobring U. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24420-24424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We have shown that the VEK-30-hK2 interaction depends upon His, Arg, and Glu side chains (20Schenone M.M. Warder S.E. Martin J.A. Prorok M. Castellino F.J. J. Pept. Res. 2000; 56: 438-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and an x-ray crystallographic structure of the VEK-30·hK2 complex shows a unique binding modality of VEK-30 to the LBS of hK2. In this case, an internal “pseudo-lysine,” formed from the positive VEK-30 side chains of Arg-17 and His-18, and the negative side chain, Glu-20, of VEK-30, separated by one α-helical turn, is inserted into the LBS of hK2 (21Rios-Steiner J.L. Schenone M. Mochalkin I. Tulinsky A. Castellino F.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 705-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). mK2 does not interact with VEK-30 despite very high sequence identity, generally, and full conservation of all residues in the LBS. We hypothesize that two residues present in mPg, Gly-220, which is an Arg in hPg, and Pro-222, which is a Leu in hPg, may explain the species specificity. In nonliganded hK2, Arg-220 forms a salt bridge with Asp-219, preventing the latter from completing the anionic locus with Asp-221 (a motif that is present in all other ligand-binding kringles), thus diminishing the ability of hK2 to bind lysine analogues. Upon VEK-30 binding, Arg-220 interacts with Glu-7 of VEK-30, permitting Asp-219 to reorient into the LBS, whereupon the canonical anionic locus is formed (21Rios-Steiner J.L. Schenone M. Mochalkin I. Tulinsky A. Castellino F.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 705-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 22Mathews I.I. Vanderhoff-Hanaver P. Castellino F.J. Tulinsky A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2567-2576Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 23Cnudde S.E. Prorok M. Castellino F.J. Geiger J.H. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 11052-11060Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Arg-220 is not only absent in mPg, but also in all other hPg and mPg kringles that fail to bind VEK-30. In addition, Pro-222 of mPg is immediately proximal in sequence to the cationic binding locus (Arg-234) of the K2-LBS. Although existing structural studies (21Rios-Steiner J.L. Schenone M. Mochalkin I. Tulinsky A. Castellino F.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 705-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 23Cnudde S.E. Prorok M. Castellino F.J. Geiger J.H. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 11052-11060Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) do not point to any direct role for residue 222 in ligand binding, its location within the LBS may alter the disposition of ligand-contacting residues depending upon the nature of the amino acid at this sequence position. In the absence of any structural data on mK2, we postulate that Pro at sequence position 222 causes a localized deleterious conformational change in this kringle with regard to VEK-30 binding. To test these hypotheses, we have constructed strategic site-directed and chimeric mouse/human Pg mutants and studied their binding affinities to VEK-30. Construction of Pg Expression Plasmids—Wild-type (WT)-hPg and WT-mPg expression plasmids, hPg-Puro-pMT and mPg-Puro-pMT, respectively, were generated by insertion of the cDNAs encoding these proteins into the multiple cloning site of the Drosophila S2 parent expression plasmid, Puro-pMT. This latter plasmid was generated by inserting the pCo-Puro cassette (24Iwaki T. Figuera M. Ploplis V.A. Castellino F.J. BioTechniques. 2003; 35: 482-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) into the commercial plasmid, pMT/BiP/V5-His(A) (Invitrogen). To accomplish this, a linker consisting of two oligonucleotide DNAs, 5′-cgccggtaccatcgatatcactagtgctag and 5′-cgctagcactagtgatatcgatggtaccgc, which generated NheI, SpeI, EcoRV, and KpnI sites, was inserted at the NarI site located upstream of the metallothionein promoter (pMT) of pMT/Bip/V5-His. The resulting plasmid was digested by NheI and KpnI to insert the XbaI/KpnI fragment from pCoPuro (24Iwaki T. Figuera M. Ploplis V.A. Castellino F.J. BioTechniques. 2003; 35: 482-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), which contains the copia promoter, puromycin N-acetyltransferase, and the SV40 poly(A) sequence. The mRNA for mPg was obtained from C57Bl/6 mouse liver using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). The first strand of cDNA was generated by SuperScript-III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), and the entire cDNA was obtained by the PCR with ExTaq polymerase (Takara Bio, Madison, WI). The sequence of the cDNA was confirmed bi-directionally. After obtaining the entire cDNA, the expression cassette for mPg was amplified using the following primers: mPg-Forward-BglII: 5′-gaagatctgactcgctggatggctacataagc (the BglII site is underlined); mPg-Reverse-XbaI: 5′-cttctagattagttattcctcatctccctttcaatcc (the XbaI site is underlined). The PCR amplicon (2398 bp) was purified by Microcon YM-100 (Millipore, Billerica, MA) and digested by BglII and XbaI, followed by its ligation into Puro-pMT through these same sites, thus providing the final expression plasmid, mPg-Puro-pMT. The hPg expression cassette was excised using the BglII/XbaI fragment of pMT-BiP-hPg (25Nilsen S.L. Castellino F.J. Prot. Express Purif. 1999; 16: 136-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and inserted into puro-pMT, through the same BglII and XbaI sites, yielding hPg-Puro-pMT, which was used for expression of hPg. The mPg and hPg chimeric expression plasmids with K2 domain interchanges (mPg[hK2] and hPg[mK2], respectively) were generated using restriction endonuclease-free cloning (26van den Ent F. Lowe J. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 2006; 67: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar) with the PCR primer pairs (synthesized by MWG Biotech, High Point, NC) and templates listed in supplemental Table S1. The PCR products were purified using the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen). The total mutagenesis reaction volume was 25 μl, including 50 ng of purified hK2 or mK2/20 ng hPg-Puro-pMT or mPg-Puro-pMT/200 μm dNTP/1× reaction buffer (Stratagene)/1.5 μl of QuikSolution/1.25 μl of Pyrococcus furiosus Ultra high-fidelity DNA polymerase (Stratagene). The mixture was heated for 60 s at 95 °C, followed by 30 cycles, consisting of denaturation at 95 °C for 50 s, annealing at 60 °C for 50 s, and elongation at 68 °C for 12 min. The product was then treated with 5 units of DpnI at 37 °C for 2 h to digest the methylated parental plasmid. The reaction mixture was then transformed into XL10-Gold ultracompetent cells (Stratagene). Positive clones were sequenced by the W. M. Keck Biotechnology Center (University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, IL). Point-mutated hPg and mPg plasmids were created with the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, Ca), using the primers and templates listed in supplemental Table S1. All final sequences were verified by DNA sequence analyses. Construction of the WT-uPA Expression Plasmid—The plasmid (PDB1519) containing mouse uPA (muPA) full-length cDNA was purchased from ATCC (Rockville, MD). A primer pair, consisting of uPA-F (5′-GTAGATCTGGCAGTGTACTTGGAGCTC) and uPA-R (5′-CGACTCGAGTCAGAAGGCCAGACCTTTCT), as the PCR forward and reverse primers, respectively, was used to amplify the cDNA coding for muPA, lacking the signal peptide coding region (the first 60 bp). The muPA amplicon, digested with BglII and XhoI, was then subcloned into the Puro-pMT expression plasmid, which also provides the BiP signal peptide. A stop codon was inserted just prior to the V5-His6 tags, because we desired to use a simple conventional purification protocol for the muPA protein. PCR was carried out using pfu DNA polymerase as above. Protein Expression and Purification—The WT and altered Pg plasmids were purified by use of a Qiagen Plasmid Midi kit (Qiagen) and then transfected into Drosophila Schneider S2 cells using a Calcium Phosphate Transfection kit (Invitrogen). Stably transfected S2 cells were then placed under selection pressure with 10 μg/ml puromycin. Surviving S2 cells were seeded into 1 liter of fresh serum-free medium (EX-CELL 420 serum-free medium for insect cells with l-glutamine, SAFC Biosciences, Lenexa, KS) in a 1-liter spinner flask, at a cell density of 3-6 × 106 cells/ml. After reaching a density of 6-8 × 106 cells/ml, the cells were induced for 2 days by 500 μm copper sulfate/5 mg/liter aprotinin (Sigma). The conditioned culture medium was immediately concentrated at 4 °C in an Amicon concentration cell using a 10,000 NMWL ultrafiltration membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Following dialysis against 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.3, at 4 °C overnight, recombinant (r) Pg was purified by affinity chromatography on lysine-Sepharose as previously reported. The r-Pg was eluted from the column by 100 mm ϵ-aminocaproic acid in dialysis buffer. Finally, the purified protein was concentrated by Centricon Plus-20 Filter Unit with Ultracel-10 membrane (Millipore). The expression of r-mouse uPA (r-muPA) was performed as for Pg. After concentrating the conditioned medium in the same manner as above, the supernatant was loaded onto a CM-Sephadex column. The column was washed with 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.3, and the r-muPA was eluted using a linear gradient of 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.3, as the start solution, to 25 mm sodium phosphate/0.5 m NaCl, pH 7.3, as the limit solution. The associated fractions were concentrated to about 1 ml and loaded onto a 150-ml column of Sephadex-G-75. The column was eluted with a solution of 25 mm sodium phosphate/150 mm NaCl, pH 7.3. Then, the purified protein was concentrated using a Centricon Plus-20 Filter Unit with Ultracel-10 membrane (Millipore). SDS-PAGE—SDS-PAGE was performed in a Mini Protean II electrophoresis apparatus (Bio-Rad). The proteins were separated in 8% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions and stained with Seeband staining solution (Gerard Biotech, Oxford, OH). Western Blots—The expressed proteins were detected by Western blotting using as the primary antibody rabbit-anti-hPg that was produced in our center, which reacts with both hPg and mPg. Goat-anti-rabbit IgG-conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Sigma) was employed as the secondary antibody. The chromogen, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium, was used for detection. Activation of Pg Variants by SK—In one set of amidolytic assays, the molar ratio of SK and the Pg to be examined was set at 1:1 to monitor generation of the SK·Pm activator complex, and, in another set of assays, this molar ratio was 1:20 in order that Pm activity, from catalytic activation of Pg to Pm, by the SK·Pm complex, could be measured. A last set of assays was designed to assess the activation of mPg variants by a catalytic amount of the SK·hPm activator complex at a 1:20 molar ratio of SK·hPm: mPg. For this latter assay, SK and hPg (1:1 molar ratio) were preincubated for 1 h at 25 °C, after which a 20-fold molar excess of mPg variants were added. In each assay, the reaction components were present in a volume of 200 μl, and contained 0.5 mm of the chromogenic substrate, S-2251 (Glu-Leu-Lys-p-nitroanilide, synthesized in our laboratory), and Pg (100 nm for the 1:1 molar ratio with SK, and 200 nm for the 20:1 molar ratio of Pg:SK or mPg:SK·hPm). The reaction was accelerated by addition of the required amount of SK (100 nm or 10 nm for the 1:1 and 1:20 ratios of Pg, respectively). The reaction buffer was 10 mm Hepes/150 mm NaOAc, pH 7.4. The absorbance at 405 nm was measured over 30 min with a Spectramax Plus 384 plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Kinetic parameters were derived from plots of the absorbance at 405 nm versus time. The assays were performed in triplicate, and the values are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Activation of Pg Variants by uPA—The assay conditions were as for SK, except that the activation of Pg (200 nm), in the presence of 0.5 mm S2251, was accelerated by addition of r-muPA at a final concentration of 0.5 μg/ml. The hydrolysis of S-2251 was monitored continually at 405 nm for 30 min, and the absorbance/min was calculated. These values for hPg and mPg were taken as 100% for comparison of activations of Pg variants within the same species of Pg. Activation of hPg and hPg Variants in the Presence of VEK-30—Activation of WT and variant hPgs by an equimolar amount of SK was monitored continually at 405 nm at 25 °C. The reaction buffer utilized for the assays was 10 mm Hepes, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. Each reaction was performed in duplicate and consisted of 0.25 mm S-2251, 150 nm hPg or hPg variant, 150 nm SK, and varying concentrations of VEK-30, in a total volume of 200 μl. The effect of VEK-30 on the uPA-catalyzed activation of hPg was also examined under the same reaction and buffer conditions. In these experiments, 25 nm hPg, 10 IU of uPA (Abbokinase, Abbott Laboratories, N. Chicago, IL), and varying concentrations of VEK-30 were employed. These sets of experiments were repeated with a randomized version of VEK-30 (AENKVDEQREYHRLKEAERKLETLAESELY-NH2) that was synthesized as described for VEK-30 (20Schenone M.M. Warder S.E. Martin J.A. Prorok M. Castellino F.J. J. Pept. Res. 2000; 56: 438-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Surface Plasmon Resonance—For preparation of the sensor chip, VEK-30, was synthesized as described earlier (20Schenone M.M. Warder S.E. Martin J.A. Prorok M. Castellino F.J. J. Pept. Res. 2000; 56: 438-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and coupled to sensor chip-CM 5 to a level of, ∼75 response units (RU) using the amine-coupling kit (BIAcore AB). In this case, the CM-5 chip was activated by 0.2 m N-ethyl-N-dimethyl-aminopropylcarbodiimide and 50 mm N-hydroxysuccinimide for 7 min at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. VEK-30 was diluted to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml, using 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.5, as the buffer. The VEK-30 solution was injected for 7 min (5 μl/min) to allow binding to the chip, after which nonbound sites on the sensor chip surface were blocked by injection of 1.0 m ethanolamine, pH 8.5, for 7 min at the same flow rate. The binding of Pg variants to VEK-30 was analyzed by surface plasmon resonance using a BIAcore™ 3000 (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). All experiments were performed at 25 °C employing HBS-EP (10 mm Hepes, 0.15 m NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.005% polysorbate 20, pH 7.4) as running buffer at a flow rate of 100 μl/min. The binding reactions were conducted by injecting various concentrations (1 μm to 10 μm) of Pg (diluted with running buffer) over the VEK-30-containing chip surface. Binding levels were determined by monitoring the resulting signal, which is expressed as RU. At the end of each cycle, the chip surfaces were regenerated by washing with 60 μl of glycine, pH 2.5, which did not alter the binding properties of immobilized VEK-30 bound to the chip. The data from these sensorgrams were subtracted from those of a reference flow cell prepared by the same method, with the exception that VEK-30 was not immobilized on the chip. The binding kinetic and equilibrium constants were calculated from the association and dissociation rate curves generated by applying different concentrations of the Pg analytes onto the VEK-30-containing chip, using a 1:1 binding model. All individual sensorgrams were analyzed utilizing the BIAevaluation software package version 4.1 (BIAcore AB). Specifically, determinations of kobs and koff were obtained through nonlinear regression fitting of the equations for monophasic association and dissociation, i.e. RU = RUmax(1 - e-kobst) and RU = ΔRU(e-kofft), respectively. Values for the association rate constant (kon) were determined from the equation kon = (kobs - koff)/[Pg]. Homology Modeling of mK2 from hK2—The x-ray crystal structure of hK2 has been determined and was used to model the three-dimensional structure of mK2. The homology model of mK2 was made followed by 200 cycles of energy minimization in the software suite, Crystallography and NMR System (CNS) (27Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 154: 905-921Crossref Scopus (16947) Google Scholar). For each r-Pg listed in supplemental Table S1, and for r-muPA, five clones were randomly selected from the hundreds of Escherichia coli transformants obtained from the individual mutated cDNAs, and the plasmids were purified. After the results of restriction enzyme analysis showed that all cDNAs of the selected clones were properly altered, each purified cDNA insert was subjected to complete nucleotide sequencing and two clones with correct sequences were chosen for plasmid purification and expression in Drosophila S2 cells. Final yields of the proteins after purification ranged from 5-60 mg/liter, and each was readily obtained at high purity (supplemental Fig. S1). This provided ample materials for the experiments that were conducted herein. Each Pg was then examined for its ability to be activated by mouse r-uPA employing an amidolytic assay for the amount of Pm generated. The relative activities of each Pg variant are not significantly different from the respective parent hPg or mPg (Fig. 1, A and B). muPA activated WT-mPg ∼30% more efficiently than WT·hPg. Additionally, activations by SK were performed for each Pg generated in this study. An equimolar ratio of SK:Pg was first employed as a reaction mixture to monitor generation of the SK·Pm activator complex (Fig. 2A). In each case of hPg variants, including the chimera in which hK2 was replaced with mK2, in the hPg background, the ability to form the active SK·hPm complex was not compromised (Fig. 2A). In the case of mPg, or any K2 variant of mPg, no measurable SK-mPm was generated. This shows that SK has a greatly reduced capacity to activate mPg and that replacement of mK2 with hK2 in mPg did not alter that fact. Next, catalytic levels of SK were employed to activate Pg to test the ability of the SK·Pm activator complex to activate the Pg variants. The data show (Fig. 2B) that in the case of hPg variants, their activatibilities by catalytic SK·Pm are not significantly different from the parent hPg. In the case of mPg variants, because it was shown that the SK·mPm activator complex could not be kinetically demonstrated (Fig. 2A), it is not surprising that no activity was found for any mPg variant (Fig. 2B). On the other hand, mPg, and each of its variants described herein, were activated equally well by the Pg activator, SK·hPm, which was preformed in a separate incubation, followed by its addition to mPg (Fig. 2C). The binding of VEK-30 to the Pg variants was assessed quantitatively by surface plasmon resonance. The traces obtained are illustrated in Fig. 3, and the corresponding kinetic binding values obtained from these curves are listed in Table 1. The KD for interaction of Pg variants with VEK-30 was assessed by deconvolution of binding rate data of the type shown by the example provided in Fig. 3A for the WT·hPg/SK interaction at various concentrations of Pg. The on (kon) and off (koff) rate constants obtained from the data were used to calculate the KD values, as was a global fitting of the entire curve. In each case, the differences in these two modes of calculation (Table 1) did not differ by an amount that affects the conclusions of the work. For the binding of hPg to VEK, the KD value of 2.94 μm is similar to the value obtained earlier by isothermal titration calorimetry for binding of VEK-30 to isolated r-K2 of hPg (8Nilsen S.L.

https://openalex.org/W1992469639,"Background Prion protein (PrP) alleles associated with scrapie susceptibility persist in many sheep populations even with high frequencies despite centuries of selection against them. This suggests that scrapie susceptibility alleles have a pleiotropic effect or are associated with fitness or other traits that have been subject to selection. Methodology/Principal Findings We genotyped all lambs in two scrapie-free Scottish Blackface sheep flocks for polymorphisms at codons 136, 154 and 171 of the PrP gene. We tested potential associations of the PrP genotype with lamb viability at birth and postnatal survival using a complementary log-log link function and a Weibull proportional hazard model, respectively. Here we show there is an association between PrP genotype, as defined by polymorphisms at codons 154 ad 171, and postnatal lamb survival in the absence of scrapie. Sheep carrying the wild-type ARQ allele have higher postnatal survival rates than sheep carrying the more scrapie-resistant alleles (ARR or AHQ). Conclusion The PrP genotypes associated with higher susceptibility to scrapie are associated with improved postnatal survival in the absence of the disease. This association helps to explain the existence, and in many instances the high frequency, of the ARQ allele in sheep populations."
https://openalex.org/W2040423399,"Glycan biosynthesis occurs though a multi-step process that requires a variety of enzymes ranging from glycosyltransferases to those involved in cytosolic sugar metabolism. In many cases, glycan biosynthesis follows a glycan-specific, linear pathway. As glycosyltransferases are generally regulated at the level of transcription, assessing the overall transcriptional profile for glycan biosynthesis genes seems warranted. However, a systematic approach for assessing the correlation between glycan expression and glycan-related gene expression has not been reported previously.To facilitate genetic analysis of glycan biosynthesis, we sought to correlate the expression of genes involved in cell-surface glycan formation with the expression of the glycans, as detected by glycan-recognizing probes. We performed cross-sample comparisons of gene expression profiles using a newly developed, glycan-focused cDNA microarray. Cell-surface glycan expression profiles were obtained using flow cytometry of cells stained with plant lectins. Pearson's correlation coefficients were calculated for these profiles and were used to identify enzyme genes correlated with glycan biosynthesis.This method, designated correlation index-based responsible-enzyme gene screening (CIRES), successfully identified genes already known to be involved in the biosynthesis of certain glycans. Our evaluation of CIRES indicates that it is useful for identifying genes involved in the biosynthesis of glycan chains that can be probed with lectins using flow cytometry."
https://openalex.org/W1982218400,"Mitochondrial ribosomal RNAs (mtrRNAs) have been reported to translocate extra-mitochondrially and localize to the germ cell determinant of oocytes and zygotes in some metazoa except mammals. To address whether the mtrRNAs also localize in the mammals, expression and distribution of mitochondrion-encoded RNAs in the mouse oocytes and zygotes was examined by whole-mount in situ hybridization (ISH). Both 12S and 16S rRNAs were predominantly distributed in the animal hemisphere of the mature oocyte. This distribution pattern was rearranged toward the second polar body in zygotes after fertilization. The amount of mtrRNAs decreased around first cleavage, remained low during second cleavage and increased after third cleavage. Staining intensity of the 12S rRNA was weaker than that of the 16S rRNA throughout the examined stages. Similar distribution dynamics of the 16S rRNA was observed in strontium-activated haploid parthenotes, suggesting the distribution rearrangement does not require a component from sperm. The distribution of 16S rRNAs did not coincide with that of mitochondrion-specific heat shock protein 70, suggesting that the mtrRNA is translocated from mitochondria. The ISH-scanning electron microscopy confirms the extra-mitochondrial mtrRNA in the mouse oocyte. Chloramphenicol (CP) treatment of late pronuclear stage zygotes perturbed first cleavage as judged by the greater than normal disparity in size of blastomeres of 2-cell conceptuses. Two-third of the CP-treated zygotes arrested at either 2-cell or 3-cell stage even after the CP was washed out. These findings indicate that the extra-mitochondrial mtrRNAs are localized in the mouse oocyte and implicated in correct cytoplasmic segregation into blastomeres through cleavages of the zygote."
https://openalex.org/W2035916760,"Cell mediated immunity, including efficient CTL response, is required to prevent HIV-1 from cell-to-cell transmission. In previous investigations, we have shown that B1 peptide derived by Fourier transformation of HIV-1 primary structures and sharing no sequence homology with the parent proteins was able to generate antiserum which recognizes envelope and Tat proteins. Here we have investigated cellular immune response towards a novel non-homologous peptide, referred to as cA1 peptide.The 20 amino acid sequence of cA1 peptide was predicted using the notion of peptide hydropathic properties; the peptide is encoded by the complementary anti-sense DNA strand to the sense strand of previously described non-homologous A1 peptide. In this report we demonstrate that the cA1 peptide can be a target for major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes in HIV-1-infected or envelope-immunized individuals. The cA1 peptide is recognized in association with different MHC class I allotypes and could prime in vitro CTLs, derived from gp160-immunized individuals capable to recognize virus variants.For the first time a theoretically designed immunogen involved in broad-based cell-immune memory activation is described. Our findings may thus contribute to the advance in vaccine research by describing a novel strategy to develop a synthetic AIDS vaccine."
https://openalex.org/W2058805217,"Arteriosclerosis is a common cause of chronic morbidity and mortality. Myocardial infarction, stroke or other cardiovascular events identify vulnerable patients who suffer from symptomatic arteriosclerosis. Biomarkers to identify vulnerable patients before cardiovascular events occur are warranted to improve care for affected individuals. We tested how accurately basic clinical data can describe and assess the activity of arteriosclerosis in the individual patient.269 in-patients who were treated for various conditions at the department of general medicine of an academic tertiary care center were included in a cross-sectional study. Personal history and clinical examination were obtained. When paraclinical tests were performed, the results were added to the dataset. The numerical variables in the clinical examination were statistically compared between patients with proven symptomatic arteriosclerosis (n = 100) and patients who had never experienced cardiovascular events in the past (n = 110). 25 variables were different between these two patient groups and contributed to the disease activity score. The percentile distribution of these variables defined the empiric clinical profile. Anthropometric data, signs of arterial, cardiac and renal disease, systemic inflammation and health economics formed the major categories of the empiric clinical profile that described an individual patient's disease activity. The area under the curve of the receiver operating curve for symptomatic arteriosclerosis was 0.891 (95% CI 0.799-0.983) for the novel disease activity score compared to 0.684 (95% CI 0.600-0.769) for the 10-year risk calculated according to the Framingham score. In patients suffering from symptomatic arteriosclerosis, the disease activity score deteriorated more rapidly after two years of follow-up (from 1.25 to 1.48, P = 0.005) compared to age- and sex-matched individuals free of cardiovascular events (from 1.09 to 1.19, P = 0.125).Empiric clinical profiling and the disease activity score that are based on accessible, available and affordable clinical data are valid markers for symptomatic arteriosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2171301638,"Background Homologous recombination in Escherichia coli creates patches (non-crossovers) or splices (half crossovers), each of which may have associated heteroduplex DNA. Heteroduplex patches have recombinant DNA in one strand of the duplex, with parental flanking markers. Which DNA strand is exchanged in heteroduplex patches reflects the molecular mechanism of recombination. Several models for the mechanism of E. coli RecBCD-mediated recombinational double-strand-end (DSE) repair specify that only the 3′-ending strand invades the homologous DNA, forming heteroduplex in that strand. There is, however, in vivo evidence that patches are found in both strands. Methodology/Principle Findings This paper re-examines heteroduplex-patch-strand polarity using phage λ and the λdv plasmid as DNA substrates recombined via the E. coli RecBCD system in vivo. These DNAs are mutant for λ recombination functions, including orf and rap, which were functional in previous studies. Heteroduplexes are isolated, separated on polyacrylamide gels, and quantified using Southern blots for heteroduplex analysis. This method reveals that heteroduplexes are still found in either 5′ or 3′ DNA strands in approximately equal amounts, even in the absence of orf and rap. Also observed is an independence of the RuvC Holliday-junction endonuclease on patch formation, and a slight but statistically significant alteration of patch polarity by recD mutation. Conclusions/Significance These results indicate that orf and rap did not contribute to the presence of patches, and imply that patches occurring in both DNA strands reflects the molecular mechanism of recombination in E. coli. Most importantly, the lack of a requirement for RuvC implies that endonucleolytic resolution of Holliday junctions is not necessary for heteroduplex-patch formation, contrary to predictions of all of the major previous models. This implies that patches are not an alternative resolution of the same intermediate that produces splices, and do not bear on models for splice formation. We consider two mechanisms that use DNA replication instead of endonucleolytic resolution for formation of heteroduplex patches in either DNA strand: synthesis-dependent-strand annealing and a strand-assimilation mechanism."
