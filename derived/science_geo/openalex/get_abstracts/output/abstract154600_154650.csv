https://openalex.org/W1967457116,"Stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) is a microsomal enzyme required for the biosynthesis of oleate and palmitoleate, which are the major monounsaturated fatty acids of membrane phospholipids, triglycerides, and cholesterol esters. Two well characterized isoforms of SCD, SCD1 and SCD2, exist in the mouse. Most mouse tissues express SCD1 and 2 with the exception of the liver, which expresses mainly the SCD1 isoform. We found that asebia mice homozygous for a natural mutation of the gene for SCD1 (SCD−/−) are deficient in hepatic cholesterol esters and triglycerides despite the presence of normal activities of acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase and glycerol phosphate acyltransferase, the enzymes responsible for cholesterol ester and triglyceride synthesis, respectively, in the liver of these mice. Feeding diets supplemented with triolein or tripalmitolein to the SCD−/− mice resulted in an increase in the levels of 16:1 and 18:1 in the liver but failed to restore the 18:1 and 16:1 levels of the cholesterol ester and triglycerides to the levels found in normal mice. The SCD−/− mouse had very low levels of triglycerides in the VLDL and LDL lipoprotein fractions compared with the normal animal. Transient transfection of an SCD1 expression vector into Chinese hamster ovary cells resulted in increased SCD activity and esterification of cholesterol to cholesterol esters. Taken together, our observations demonstrate that the oleoyl-CoA and palmitoleyl-CoA produced by SCD1 are necessary to synthesize enough cholesterol esters and triglycerides in the liver and suggest that regulation of SCD1 activity plays an important role in mechanisms of cellular cholesterol homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2060697601,"Doxorubicin (DOX) is a broad spectrum anthracycline antibiotic used to treat a variety of cancers. Redox activation of DOX to form reactive oxygen species has been implicated in DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. In this work we investigated DOX-induced apoptosis in cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes isolated from adult rat heart. Exposure of bovine aortic endothelial cells or myocytes to submicromolar levels of DOX induced significant apoptosis as measured by DNA fragmentation and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated nick-end labeling assays. Pretreatment of cells with 100 μm nitrone spin traps, N-tert-butyl-α-phenylnitrone (PBN) or α-(4-pyridyl-1-oxide)-N-tert-butylnitrone (POBN) dramatically inhibited DOX-induced apoptosis. Ebselen (20–50 μm), a glutathione peroxidase mimetic, also significantly inhibited apoptosis. DOX (0.5–1 μm) inactivated mitochondrial complex I by a superoxide-dependent mechanism. PBN (100 μm), POBN (100 μm), and ebselen (50 μm) restored complex I activity. These compounds also inhibited DOX-induced caspase-3 activation and cytochrome crelease. PBN and ebselen also restored glutathione levels in DOX-treated cells. We conclude that nitrone spin traps and ebselen inhibit the DOX-induced apoptotic signaling mechanism and that this antiapoptotic mechanism may be linked in part to the inhibition in formation or scavenging of hydrogen peroxide. Therapeutic strategies to mitigate DOX cardiotoxicity should be reexamined in light of these emerging antiapoptotic mechanisms of antioxidants.

Martasek P. Hogg N. Masters B.S.S. Pritchard Jr., K.A. Kalyanaraman B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11293-11297Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The target organelle of DOX-induced toxicity in cardiomyocytes is mitochondria, which accumulates DOX over time (13Sarvazyan N. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: H2079-H2085PubMed Google Scholar,14Konorev E.A. Kennedy M.C. Kalyanaraman B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 368: 421-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial enzymes (e.g. NADH dehydrogenase) have been shown to activate DOX to form the semiquinone radical and superoxide anion (8Davies K.J.A. Doroshow J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3060-3067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Doxorubicin induces apoptosis (or programmed cell death) in tumor cells by blocking the cell cycle and inhibiting the DNA polymerase enzyme (15Konopa J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1988; 37: 2303-2309Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 16Skladanowski A. Konopa J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1993; 46: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Recent studies indicate that myocardial impairment caused by DOX may involve myocyte apoptosis (17Sawyer D.B. Fukazawa R. Arstall M.A. Kelly R.A. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In contrast to the cytostatic mechanism of tumor cell apoptosis (16Skladanowski A. Konopa J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1993; 46: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), DOX-induced myocyte apoptosis is presumably mediated by oxidative free radical formation (17Sawyer D.B. Fukazawa R. Arstall M.A. Kelly R.A. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Exposure of myocytes to DOX at low concentrations (≅5 μm) induced apoptosis (17Sawyer D.B. Fukazawa R. Arstall M.A. Kelly R.A. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). However, at higher concentrations (>10 μm) DOX caused only necrosis but not apoptosis in cultured neonatal and adult cardiomyocytes (17Sawyer D.B. Fukazawa R. Arstall M.A. Kelly R.A. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The intracellular concentration of DOX was reported to be nearly 2 orders of magnitude higher than its extracellular concentration in culture medium (13Sarvazyan N. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: H2079-H2085PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, at clinically relevant plasma DOX concentrations (≅0.5–1 μm), the intramitochondrial concentration is likely to be much higher (50–100 μm). Apoptosis in myocardium eventually leads to cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure through a systematic reduction in the amount of cardiomyocytes (18Narula J. Haider N. Virmani R. DiSalvo T.G. Kolodgie F.D. Hajjar R.J. Schmidt U. Semigran M.J. Dec G.W. Khaw B.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 335: 1182-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (1240) Google Scholar). Thus, a complete understanding of the mechanism of DOX-induced apoptosis in endothelial cells and myocytes may lead to new therapeutic modalities.Nitrone radical traps (or spin traps) inhibited thymocyte apoptosis as did nitroxides (19Slater A.F.G. Nobel S. Maellaro E. Bustamante J. Kimland M. Orrenius S. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 771-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of inhibition is not known. Nitrone radical traps protected against doxorubicin-mediated cardiac injury in isolated rat hearts (20Monti E. Paracchini L. Perletti G. Piccinini F. Free Radic. Res. Commun. 1991; 14: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 21Cova D. DeAngelis L. Monti E. Piccinini F. Free Radic. Res. Commun. 1992; 15: 353-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The objective of this study is to investigate the antiapoptotic mechanism of nitrones and other cell-permeable antioxidants in DOX-induced apoptosis.In this study we demonstrate that DOX causes apoptosis in bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) and adult rat ventricular cardiomyocytes at submicromolar concentrations. DOX-induced apoptosis was reversed by ebselen, a glutathione peroxidase mimetic (14Konorev E.A. Kennedy M.C. Kalyanaraman B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 368: 421-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and by nitrone radical spin traps (Fig. 1). DOX-induced apoptosis was abrogated by DEVD-CHO, a specific inhibitor of caspase-3, and DOX-induced caspase-3 activation was markedly diminished by nitrone traps and ebselen. We propose a novel antiapoptotic mechanism of action for compounds that inhibit DOX-induced apoptosis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsEbselen (2-phenyl-1,2-benzisoselenazol-3(2H)-one) and PBN (α-phenyl-tert-butyl nitrone) were obtained from Sigma. PBN was also obtained from the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation Spin Trap Source as a gift from Dr. Ronald P. Mason (NIEHS, North Carolina). Mn(III)tetrakis(4-benzoic acid) porphyrin (MnTBAP) was synthesized according to published methods (22Day B.J. Shawen S. Liochev S.I. Crapo J.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 275: 1227-1232PubMed Google Scholar). POBN,N-tert-butyl hydroxylamine, andN-benzyl hydroxylamine were purchased from Aldrich. 2-Sulfoxyphenyl N-tert-butylnitrone was synthesized according to the published procedure (23Janzen, E. G., and Shetty, R. V. (1979) Tetrahedron Lett. 3229–3232.Google Scholar). Anti-cytc monoclonal antibody 7H8·2C12 was purchased from PharMingen (San Diego, CA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse monoclonal antibody was purchased from Pierce. DEVD-CHO and Z-VAD-fmk were obtained from Calbiochem.Endothelial Cell CultureBAEC were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Cells were obtained at the third passage, transferred to 75-cm2 filter vent flasks (Costar, Cambridge, MA), and grown to confluence (5.2 × 106 cells/75 cm2) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), insulin (10 μg/ml), transferrin (5 μg/ml), l-glutamine (4 mmol/l), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml), incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. All experiments were performed in a similar medium containing 15% FBS. Cells were passaged as described by Balla et al. (24Balla G.H. Jacob H.S. Eaton J.W. Belcher J.D. Vercelotti G.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1991; 111: 1700-1711Crossref Scopus (385) Google Scholar) and used between passages 6 and 13.Myocyte Isolation and CultureMale Harlan Sprague-Dawley adult rats were anesthetized with pentobarbital (60 mg/kg intraperitoneal), and hearts were excised and placed into ice-cold saline (25Konorev E.A. Joseph H. Tarpey M.M. Kalyanaraman B. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 119: 511-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Hearts were mounted on aortic cannulas and perfused with a buffer containing (in mm) 125 NaCl, 25 Hepes, 11 glucose, 10 creatine, 10 taurine, 4.7 KCl, 1.2 MgSO4, 1.2 KH2PO4, pH 7.3. The perfusion buffer was saturated with 100% oxygen and supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2. After a 10-min perfusion, it was changed to a nominally Ca2+-free buffer. After a 5-min perfusion with Ca2+-free buffer, the perfusion was continued by recirculation of 40 ml of buffer supplemented with collagenase (type II, Life Technologies, Inc., 200 units/ml) and CaCl2 (25 μm) as described (26Piper H.M. Volz A. Schwartz P. Piper H.M. Cell Culture Techniques in Heart and Vessel Research. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg1990: 36-60Crossref Google Scholar). After 30 min, ventricular tissue was minced and incubated for 10 min in a recirculating medium with 1% bovine serum albumin and 20 μg/ml deoxyribonuclease (Sigma). Cells were released from chunks of tissue by gentle pipetting. The cell suspension was filtered through an 80-mesh screen. The cell suspension was washed twice by gentle centrifugation and then resuspended in a CaCl2-containing buffer. The concentration of CaCl2 in the buffer was successively increased to 0.2 and 0.5 mm. To separate myocytes, the cell suspension was layered over a 4% bovine serum albumin solution in a buffer containing 1 mm CaCl2. Ventricular myocytes were allowed to settle and then plated onto 4-chamber slides or 100-mm dishes precoated with laminin (Life Technologies, Inc.). The culture medium contained M-199 (Sigma) supplemented with 25 mm NaHCO3, 25 mm Hepes, 10% FBS, 2 mm l-carnitine, 5 mm creatine, 5 mm taurine, 2 mm glutamine, 100 μm ascorbic acid, 0.1 μm insulin (Life Technologies, Inc.), 10 μmcytosine-β-d-arabinofuranoside, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Intact cardiomyocytes adhered to the culture plates; damaged cells were washed away during the medium change 2 h after plating. Cardiomyocytes were cultured under these conditions for 7–10 days prior to incubation with DOX.Measurement of ApoptosisDNA FragmentationA distinctive feature of apoptosis at the biochemical level is DNA fragmentation (27Duvall E. Wyllie A.H. Immunol. Today. 1986; 7: 115-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). This method was used as a semi-quantitative method for measuring apoptosis (27Duvall E. Wyllie A.H. Immunol. Today. 1986; 7: 115-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). The culture medium was removed and centrifuged at 3000 × g for 5 min to collect detached cells. Adherent cells were lysed with a hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) containing EDTA (10 mm) and Triton X-100 (0.5%) and then pooled with pellets made of detached cells. RNA was digested using RNase (0.1 mg/ml at 37 °C for 1 h) followed by proteinase K treatment for 2 h at 50 °C. DNA was extracted with a mixture of phenol, chloroform, and isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1). DNA was precipitated by adding an equal volume of isopropyl alcohol, stored overnight at −20 °C, and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The pellet was air-dried, resuspended in 20 μl Tris acetate EDTA buffer supplemented with 2 μl of sample buffer (0.25% bromphenol blue, 30% glyceric acid), and electrophoretically separated on a 2% agarose gel containing 1 μg/ml ethidium bromide and visualized under ultraviolet transillumination.The TUNEL AssayThe terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay was used for microscopic detection of apoptosis (28Gavrieli Y. Sherman Y. Ben-Sasson S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 119: 493-501Crossref Scopus (9120) Google Scholar). This assay is based on labeling of 3′-free hydroxyl ends of the fragmented DNA with fluorescein-dUTP catalyzed by terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase. Procedures were followed according to the commercially available kit (ApoAlert) from CLONTECH. Apoptotic cells exhibit a strong nuclear green fluorescence that can be detected using a standard fluorescein filter (520 nm). All cells stained with propidium iodide exhibit a strong red cytoplasmic fluorescence at 620 nm. The areas of apoptotic cells were detected by fluorescence microscopy equipped with rhodamine and fluorescein isothiocyanate filters. The quantification of apoptosis was performed using a Sigma Scan Pro 5.0 image analysis package.Caspase-3 ActivityCaspase-3-like activity is increased through a protease cascade during apoptosis in the early stage (29Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Trends Biol. Sci. 1997; 22: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2176) Google Scholar). Following treatment with DOX and other antioxidants, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed with cell lysis buffer (caspase-3 assay kit,CLONTECH). Samples were incubated on ice for 10 min and then centrifuged in a microcentrifuge at 12,000 ×g for 3 min at 4 °C in order to precipitate out the cellular debris. The caspase-3 activity in the supernatant was measured in a spectrophotometer using DEVD-p-nitroanilide as a substrate according to the manufacturer's instructions provided with the assay kit.Mitochondrial Cytochrome c ReleaseThe release of mitochondrial cytochrome c into the cytosol is a key step in apoptosis (30Leist M. Single B. Castoldi A.F. Kühnle S. Nicotera P. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1481-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar, 31Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We examined cytochromec release using the published methods (32Messmer U.K. Briner V.A. Pfeilschifter J. Kidney Int. 1999; 55: 2322-2337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Briefly, BAEC and cardiomyocytes were washed with ice-cold PBS and resuspended in 100 μl of extraction buffer (50 mm PIPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 220 mm mannitol, 68 mm sucrose, 50 mmEGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol and protease inhibitors) and allowed to swell on ice for 30 min. Cells were homogenized by passing the suspension through a 25-gauge needle (10 strokes). The lysate was centrifuged at 750 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C to pellet out the nuclei. The remaining supernatant was centrifuged for 15 min at 10,000 ×g. The pellet was used as the mitochondrial fraction and the supernatant as the cytosolic fraction. Protein was determined by the Bradford method (33Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (213510) Google Scholar), and 50 μg was used for Western blotting. Proteins were separated on 14% polyacrylamide gels and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride sheets. These sheets were washed twice with Tris-buffered saline (TBS) (140 mm NaCl, 50 mmTris, pH 7.2) containing 0.1% Tween 20 before blocking nonspecific binding with TBS, 5% skim milk, 1% fetal calf serum. Filters were incubated with the mouse anticytochrome c antibody (clone 7H8.C12, PharMingen, San Diego, CA) 1 μg/ml in TBS, 2% skim milk, 0.7% fetal calf serum) overnight at 4 °C. Sheets were washed 5 times, and nonspecific binding was blocked as described previously (34Tepper A.D. de Vries E. van Blitterswijk W.J. Borst J. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 971-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Detection was by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse monoclonal antibody (1:1000) for 1.5 h at room temperature using the enhanced chemiluminescence method (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).Enzyme Activities and MetabolitesLactate DehydrogenaseLactate dehydrogenase was assayed in an aliquot of culture medium using the optimized lactate dehydrogenase procedure according to the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma), which uses the reaction of pyruvate reduction with an equimolar amount of NADH in phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. The lactate dehydrogenase activity in the sample was measured by monitoring the rate of decrease in absorbance at 340 nm.AconitaseBoth BAEC and myocytes were washed three times with cold PBS and lysed with a lysing buffer containing 0.2% Triton X-100, 100 μm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, and 5 mm citrate in PBS. The activity of aconitase in cell lysates was measured in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 20 mm dl-trisodium isocitrate. An extinction coefficient for cis-aconitate of 3.6 mm−1 at 240 nm was used (35Kennedy M.C. Emptage M.H. Dreyer J.-L. Beinert H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11098-11105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Complex IThe activity of complex I was measured as described previously (36Yen H.-C. Oberley T.D. Gairola G. Szweda L.I. St. Clair D.K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 362: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell pellets, following centrifugation were freeze-thawed three times. Twenty microliters of cellular homogenate (0.3 mg) was added to 1 ml of potassium phosphate buffer (10 mm, pH 8.0) containing NADH (100 μm) in a 1-ml cuvette at 37 °C. To this mixture was added 5 μl of 10 mm ubiquinone-1, and the stimulated rate of NADH oxidation (λmax = 340 nm, ε = 6.81 mm−1cm−1) was measured to be the complex I activity. No increase in NADH oxidation was observed in the presence of the complex I inhibitor, rotenone (2 μm).Glutathione and ATP MeasurementsThe level of glutathione (GSH) was measured in 12,000 × g supernatant (37Hissin P.J. Hilf R. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 74: 214-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (3660) Google Scholar, 38Gotoh N. Graham A. Niki E. Darley-Usmar V.M. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 151-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The intensities of fluorescence due to the GSH-orthophthalaldehyde adduct at pH 8.0 and GSSG-orthophthalaldehyde at pH 12.0 were measured at an excitation-emission of 350–420 nm using authentic GSH and GSSG as the standards.ATP was extracted from endothelial cells using ice-cold 1 nHClO4. The acidified cell suspension was transferred to plastic tubes and centrifuged (10,000 × g) at 2 °C for 5 min. The pellet was used for protein determination after dissolving the precipitate in 10% NaOH. The supernatant was neutralized with 5 m potassium carbonate and centrifuged again to remove the precipitate of potassium perchlorate. Neutralized extract was used in the ATP assay (39Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. Academic Press, New York1974Google Scholar). Doxorubicin (DOX)1 is a broad-spectrum antitumor antibiotic that is used to treat a variety of cancers (1Singal P.K. Iliskovic N. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 339: 900-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1543) Google Scholar).

Mitochondrial enzymes (e.g. NADH dehydrogenase) have been shown to activate DOX to form the semiquinone radical and superoxide anion (8Davies K.J.A. Doroshow J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3060-3067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Doxorubicin induces apoptosis (or programmed cell death) in tumor cells by blocking the cell cycle and inhibiting the DNA polymerase enzyme (15Konopa J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1988; 37: 2303-2309Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 16Skladanowski A. Konopa J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1993; 46: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Recent studies indicate that myocardial impairment caused by DOX may involve myocyte apoptosis (17Sawyer D.B. Fukazawa R. Arstall M.A. Kelly R.A. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In contrast to the cytostatic mechanism of tumor cell apoptosis (16Skladanowski A. Konopa J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1993; 46: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), DOX-induced myocyte apoptosis is presumably mediated by oxidative free radical formation (17Sawyer D.B. Fukazawa R. Arstall M.A. Kelly R.A. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Exposure of myocytes to DOX at low concentrations (≅5 μm) induced apoptosis (17Sawyer D.B. Fukazawa R. Arstall M.A. Kelly R.A. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). However, at higher concentrations (>10 μm) DOX caused only necrosis but not apoptosis in cultured neonatal and adult cardiomyocytes (17Sawyer D.B. Fukazawa R. Arstall M.A. Kelly R.A. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The intracellular concentration of DOX was reported to be nearly 2 orders of magnitude higher than its extracellular concentration in culture medium (13Sarvazyan N. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: H2079-H2085PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, at clinically relevant plasma DOX concentrations (≅0.5–1 μm), the intramitochondrial concentration is likely to be much higher (50–100 μm). Apoptosis in myocardium eventually leads to cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure through a systematic reduction in the amount of cardiomyocytes (18Narula J. Haider N. Virmani R. DiSalvo T.G. Kolodgie F.D. Hajjar R.J. Schmidt U. Semigran M.J. Dec G.W. Khaw B.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 335: 1182-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (1240) Google Scholar). Thus, a complete understanding of the mechanism of DOX-induced apoptosis in endothelial cells and myocytes may lead to new therapeutic modalities. Nitrone radical traps (or spin traps) inhibited thymocyte apoptosis as did nitroxides (19Slater A.F.G. Nobel S. Maellaro E. Bustamante J. Kimland M. Orrenius S. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 771-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of inhibition is not known. Nitrone radical traps protected against doxorubicin-mediated cardiac injury in isolated rat hearts (20Monti E. Paracchini L. Perletti G. Piccinini F. Free Radic. Res. Commun. 1991; 14: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 21Cova D. DeAngelis L. Monti E. Piccinini F. Free Radic. Res. Commun. 1992; 15: 353-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The objective of this study is to investigate the antiapoptotic mechanism of nitrones and other cell-permeable antioxidants in DOX-induced apoptosis. In this study we demonstrate that DOX causes apoptosis in bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) and adult rat ventricular cardiomyocytes at submicromolar concentrations. DOX-induced apoptosis was reversed by ebselen, a glutathione peroxidase mimetic (14Konorev E.A. Kennedy M.C. Kalyanaraman B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 368: 421-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and by nitrone radical spin traps (Fig. 1). DOX-induced apoptosis was abrogated by DEVD-CHO, a specific inhibitor of caspase-3, and DOX-induced caspase-3 activation was markedly diminished by nitrone traps and ebselen. We propose a novel antiapoptotic mechanism of action for compounds that inhibit DOX-induced apoptosis. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsEbselen (2-phenyl-1,2-benzisoselenazol-3(2H)-one) and PBN (α-phenyl-tert-butyl nitrone) were obtained from Sigma.

https://openalex.org/W2064944758,"Of the four known tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), TIMP-3 is distinguished by its tighter binding to the extracellular matrix. The present results show that glycosaminoglycans such as heparin, heparan sulfate, chondroitin sulfates A, B, and C, and sulfated compounds such as suramin and pentosan efficiently extract TIMP-3 from the postpartum rat uterus. Enzymatic treatment by heparinase III or chondroitinase ABC also releases TIMP-3, but neither one alone gives complete release. Confocal microscopy shows colocalization of heparan sulfate and TIMP-3 in the endometrium subjacent to the lumen of the uterus. Immunostaining of TIMP-3 is lost upon digestion of tissue sections with heparinase III and chondroitinase ABC. The N-terminal domain of human TIMP-3 was expressed and found to bind to heparin with affinity similar to that of full-length mouse TIMP-3. The A and B β-strands of the N-terminal domain of TIMP-3 contain two potential heparin-binding sequences rich in lysine and arginine; these strands should form a double track on the outer surface of TIMP-3. Synthetic peptides corresponding to segments of these two strands compete for heparin in the DNase II binding assay. TIMP-3 binding may be important for the cellular regulation of activity of the matrix metalloproteinases."
https://openalex.org/W2168677256,"High affinity binding of Ca(2+) to alpha-lactalbumin (LA) stabilizes the native structure and is required for the efficient generation of native protein with correct disulfide bonds from the reduced denatured state. A progressive increase in affinity of LA conformers for Ca(2+) as they develop increasingly native structures can account for the tendency of the apo form to assume a molten globule state and the large acceleration of folding by Ca(2+). To investigate the effect of calcium on structure of bovine LA, x-ray structures have been determined for crystals of the apo and holo forms at 2.2-A resolution. In both crystal forms, which were grown at high ionic strength, the protein is in a similar global native conformation consisting of alpha-helical and beta-subdomains separated by a cleft. Even though alternative cations and Ca(2+) liganding solvent molecules are absent, removal of Ca(2+) has only minor effects on the structure of the metal-binding site and a structural change was observed in the cleft on the opposite face of the molecule adjoining Tyr(103) of the helical lobe and Gln(54) of the beta-lobe. Changes include increased separation of the lobes, loss of a buried solvent molecule near the Ca(2+)-binding site, and the replacement of inter- and intra-lobe H-bonds of Tyr(103) by interactions with new immobilized water molecules. The more open cleft structure in the apo protein appears to be an effect of calcium binding transmitted via a change in orientation of helix H3 relative to the beta-lobe to the inter-lobe interface. Calcium is well known to promote the folding of LA. The results from the comparison of apo and holo structures of LA provide high resolution structural evidence that the acceleration of folding by Ca(2+) is mediated by an effect on interactions between the two subdomains."

Nevertheless, its conservation in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, its importance in mitochondrial energy production, and the accumulation of iron in its absence suggest fundamental requirements in iron metabolism. Eukaryotic frataxin homologues are expressed in the cytoplasm as larger precursors that are cleaved upon entry into mitochondria to yield mature proteins (16Koutnikova H. Campuzano V. Koenig M. Hum.

Human frataxin is similarly processed to an apparent 18-kDa protein, although precise sites of cleavage have not been reported. Bacterial frataxins naturally lack the mitochondrial localization signal altogether. The cleaved, mitochondrial localization signals are not conserved. In contrast, there is high homology among the mature yeast protein, the corresponding regions of other eukaryotic frataxins, and the encoded proteins from bacteria (Fig. 1). We have determined the x-ray crystal structure of mature human frataxin to predict potential functions and to provide a framework for testing hypotheses.Figure 2Structure of frataxin.

The His tag was cleaved using bovine thrombin (4 units/mg, 20 °C, 16 h), and the protein was further purified by anion-exchange chromatography (Mono-Q FPLC). Crystals were obtained at room temperature by equilibrating 1-μl drops of 50 mg/ml protein in 5 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.3 m NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol) and 1 μl of crystallization buffer (2.5 m ammonium sulfate, 2% sucrose, 100 mmsodium citrate, pH 6.0) using the hanging drop method. Under identical crystallization conditions, crystals grew in two space groups (P212121 and C2) within 7 days to ∼0.5 × 0.5 × 1.0 mm. For the preparation of derivatives, the crystals were first equilibrated in stabilization buffer: 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 3.8 m ammonium sulfate.

Human frataxin (residues 88–210, lacking the amino-terminal mitochondrial import sequence) is a compact αβ sandwich (Fig. 2). Elements of secondary structure are labeled in order of sequence (Figs. 1 and2). Strands β1–β5 form a flat antiparallel β sheet that interacts with the two helices, α1 and α2. The axes of the two helices are nearly parallel to each other, and both are parallel to the plane of the large β sheet. A second, smaller β sheet is formed by the C terminus of β5 and strands β6 and β7. This smaller sheet projects from the N terminus of α2 along its long axis. The connections between all elements of secondary structure are short and well ordered, which contributes to the compact apearance of frataxin. Consistent with this appearance, crystallographic temperature factors are low throughout the protein, averaging 23.6 Å2 for the entire structure (residues 90–208 and 81 water molecules). A random coil, extending from the C terminus of helix α2 to the end of the protein, runs antiparallel to the two helices and packs against the body of the protein at the interface between the helices. Search comparisons made using the programs Dali and Cath suggest that the architecture of frataxin represents a new protein fold. Frataxins from different species are nearly certain to have the same core structures. Elements of secondary structure are conserved (Fig. 1). Consistent with its compact fold, there are no significant insertions or deletions between predicted helices and strands of other frataxins (Fig. 1). However, the frataxin tail sequences, extending from the C terminus of helix α2, diverge in sequence and differ in length. The 17-residue tail of human frataxin adopts a random coil that is tethered to the body of the domain. Hydrophobic side chains from Leu-198, Leu-200, and Leu-203 of the tail point inward and contribute to the protein core. These residues are undoubtedly necessary for the stability of the mammalian proteins. Most other frataxins, including those from bacteria, have shorter tail sequences with at least two homologous hydrophobic residues. These tail sequences may similarly “cap” the hydrophobic core. However, the yeast homologue Yfh1p has evolved with only four, non-hydrophobic residues C-terminal to helix α2, suggesting that frataxin tails have no conserved function other than protein stabilization. The clustering of negatively charged residues on one surface of human frataxin is striking (Fig.3 A). Side chains from nine acidic residues project outward from helix α1: Glu-92, Glu-96, Glu-100, Glu-101, Glu-104, Glu-108, Glu-111, Asp-112, and Asp-115. These are joined by three additional acidic side chains from residues in β1 at the edge of the large sheet (Glu-121, Asp-122, and Asp-124). The 12 acidic side chains point in the same general direction to form a large, contiguous anionic patch on the protein surface (Fig.4). The solvent-accessible surface area of the patch is 915 Å2, compared with a total accessible surface area for the protein of 4732 Å2 (determined using the program CNS (24Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Delano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar) and a 1.4-Å probe). Because few charged groups are distributed over the remaining surface of frataxin, the clustering of acidic residues creates a significant charge dipole. Residues corresponding to human frataxin Glu-100, Glu-108, Glu-111, and Asp-124 are conserved in other animals and in plants, yeast, and eubacteria (Fig. 1). Although other acidic residues within the clusters are less well conserved, because similar numbers of acidic residues are present in the first helix and first strand of all frataxins, all are predicted to have similar anionic surface patches and charge dipoles. Ferritins are iron storage proteins that similarly contain conserved clusters of acidic residues. Twenty-four protomers assemble to form 12-nm hollow spheres, with as many as 4500 iron atoms sequestered in an 8-nm central cavity. Each subunit forms a four-helix bundle. Clusters of acidic residues are required for oxidation of Fe(II) to Fe(III) within channels leading to the core and for ferrihydrite nucleation at the inner surface of the central cavity. Substitutions of individual acidic residues markedly reduce oxidative or nucleation activities (25Chasteen N.D. Harrison P.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 126: 182-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Because iron accumulates in the mitochondria of cells that lack frataxin activity, it has been postulated that frataxin is involved in iron homeostasis (10Babcock M. de Silva D. Oaks R. Davis-Kaplan S. Jiralerspong S. Montermini L. Pandolfo M. Kaplan J. Science. 1997; 276: 1709-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar, 13Rotig A. de Lonlay P. Chretien D. Foury F. Koenig M. Sidi D. Munnich A. Rustin P. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 215-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). Human frataxin by itself is a monomer, and no iron is present in the bacterially expressed protein, as assessed by atomic absorption (data not shown). We soaked crystals in ferrous sulfate and ferric chloride under conditions similar to those for generating heavy metal derivatives (10 mm for 12 h) to determine whether iron would bind to frataxin. In both cases x-ray diffraction data revealed binding of one iron atom per frataxin molecule, coordinated to His-177. The iron displaces a fixed water molecule and forms a 2.08-Å bond to Nε of His-177 (Fig. 5). His-177 is in the short loop connecting strands β6 and β7. The His-177 side chain is solvent-exposed, at a site distant from the acidic patch, and lacks interactions with the rest of the molecule. His-177 is at a crystal packing interface, and the iron bound to it is loosely associated (>4 Å) with backbone carbonyl oxygens (Ala-114 and Asp-115) and a carboxylate side chain (Asp-115) of an adjacent molecule. For these reasons and most importantly because His-177 is not conserved, the mode of iron binding that we have observed is probably not related to frataxin function in mitochondria. It is more likely that if frataxin binds iron, it does so by assembling with itself or other mitochondrial proteins to utilize its acidic patch as is seen with ferritin (25Chasteen N.D. Harrison P.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 126: 182-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Twenty-six residues in our structure are identical in eukaryotes whose frataxin sequences are currently available, and other residues are highly conserved (Fig.1). Conserved residues arising from the internal faces of the large sheet and the two helices help form the hydrophobic core of frataxin. An even larger collection of conserved residues forms the external surface of the large β sheet (Fig. 3 B). Fifteen residues from strands β1–β5 that form this surface are conserved in eukaryotes, and six of these residues are conserved as well in eubacteria. The residues are mostly uncharged, making the flat, 1008-Å2 surface nearly neutral. Val-131, Val-144, Pro-150, Trp-155, Pro-159, and Pro-163 add hydrophobicity and potential binding hot spots (26Clackson T. Wells J.A. Science. 1995; 267: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1783) Google Scholar). Residues Thr-133, Thr-142, Asn-146, Gln-148, Asn-151, Gln-153, Ser-161 within this surface, and Asp-124 and Arg-165 at its periphery, render it moderately hydrophilic overall. We predict that this surface might mediate a specific and critical protein-protein interaction, although the putative partner is not known. It is hard to imagine why the surface might otherwise be so well conserved. Friedreich's ataxia is caused by abnormalities in both alleles of theFRDA locus. Most patients have GAA triplet repeat expansion within intron 1, which leads to abnormally low levels of frataxin protein (5Sakamoto N. Chastain P.D. Parniewski P. Ohshima K. Pandolfo M.

However, a small percentage of patients are compound heterozygotes having a combination of increased GAA repeats in one allele and a point mutation in the other allele. Thus loss of protein or loss of function similarly cause the disease. Complete loss of function, as occurs with homozygous disruption of the locus in mice, is lethal (27Cossee M. Puccio H.

Known mutations associated with Friedreich's ataxia map to similar sites as the conserved residues (Fig. 3 C). Several are in the protein core, including L106S, I154F, L156P, W173G, L182H/L182F, and H183R (7Cossee M. Durr A. Schmitt M. Dahl N. Trouillas P. Allinson P. Kostrzewa M. Nivelon-Chevallier A.

Neurol. 1999; 45: 200-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), consistent with a requirement for maintenance of a stable, compact structure. Another mutation, D122Y, is within the anionic patch. This mutation alters charge within this surface and overall protein polarity. The remaining three published mutations, G130V, W155R, and R165C, are located within the flat, conserved external surface of the large β sheet. The fact that mutations within these two conserved surfaces, the anionic patch and the external surface of the β sheet, are associated with disease firmly supports hypotheses that these surfaces are critical for frataxin function. Patients with D122Y, G130V, and R165C mutations have clinical courses that might be distinguished from other patients (7Cossee M. Durr A. Schmitt M. Dahl N. Trouillas P. Allinson P. Kostrzewa M.

The GBM function is impaired in certain renal diseases, including Alport syndrome, a hereditary form of progressive renal disease caused by mutations in genes encoding type IV collagen; Goodpasture disease, an autoimmune disease characterized by glomerulonephritis and anti-GBM antibodies; and Alport post-transplant nephritis, an anti-GBM disease that develops in some Alport patients after kidney transplants (1Hudson B.G. Reeders S.T. Tryggvason K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26033-26036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies of the molecular basis of these diseases over the past 2 decades have revealed that the common molecular component affected is type IV collagen. Type IV collagen is the major constituent of basement membranes and consists of a family of six homologous α chains, designated α1–α6. Each chain is characterized by a long collagenous domain of ∼1400 residues of Gly-Xaa-Yaa repeats, interrupted by ∼20 short noncollagenous sequences, and by a noncollagenous (NC1) domain of ∼230 residues at the carboxyl terminus. Three α chains assemble into triple-helical molecules that further associate to form supramolecular networks by dimerization at the carboxyl terminus through NC1 domains and by formation of tetramers at the amino terminus (2Timpl R. Wiedemann H. van Delden V. Furthmayr H. Kuhn K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 120: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 3Yurchenco P.D. Furthmayr H. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1839-1850Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). In GBM, two networks with distinct chain composition have been identified (4Gunwar S. Ballester F. Noelken M.E. Sado Y. Ninomiya Y. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8767-8775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar): an α1·α2(IV) network and a more cross-linked α3·α4·α5(IV) network characterized by loops and supercoiling (Fig. 1). In the normal glomerular development, the α1·α2(IV) network is assembled first in the embryonic glomerulus, but then there is a developmental switch to the synthesis of the α3·α4·α5(IV) network that forms the GBM of the mature glomerulus in rodents (5Miner J.H. Sanes J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 879-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar), dogs (6Harvey S.J. Zheng K. Sado Y. Naito I. Ninomiya Y. Jacobs R.M. Hudson B.G. Thorner P.S. Kidney Int. 1998; 54: 1857-1866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and humans (7Kalluri R. Shield C.F. Todd P. Hudson B.G. Neilson E.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2470-2478Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). This developmental switch is arrested in Alport syndrome by mutations in any of the genes encoding the α3(IV), α4(IV), or α5(IV) chains. As a result, the GBM in Alport patients is composed of the embryonic α1·α2(IV) network rather than the mature α3·α4·α5(IV) network. The absence of the α3·α4·α5(IV) network in Alport patients leads to the deterioration of the GBM and progressive loss of renal function over a period of 10–20 years, possibly by rendering the GBM susceptible to proteolysis (7Kalluri R. Shield C.F. Todd P. Hudson B.G. Neilson E.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2470-2478Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). More than 300 mutations have now been identified in the X-linked form of the disease in the COL4A5 gene encoding the α5(IV) chain (8Jais J.P. Knebelmann B. Giatras I. De Marchi M. Rizzoni G.

The answer to this question is critical, because it would indicate whether novel therapeutic approaches, such as gene therapy, are feasible for the treatment of Alport patients. Our recent finding that the α3, α4 and α5(IV) chains are interlinked by disulfide bonds forming a distinct network (4Gunwar S. Ballester F. Noelken M.E. Sado Y. Ninomiya Y. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8767-8775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) suggests that the underlying mechanism may be operative at the level of triple-helix assembly. For example, the α3, α4, and α5(IV) chains may each be required to assemble a triple-helical molecule comprising all three chains. Then a mutation in any of the three chains could lead to defective assembly of triple-helical molecules and thereby prevent network assembly. This mechanism would be similar to the well established paradigm in which mutations in type I collagen lead to osteogenesis imperfecta (12Prockop D.J. Kivirikko K.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 403-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar). Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the network defect in Alport syndrome requires further knowledge of the organization of α1–α5(IV) chains and the discriminatory interactions among them that govern the normal assembly of two distinct networks in GBM. The specificity for assembly into different networks may be an intrinsic feature of the α(IV) chains, encoded in their primary structure. Since folding of type IV collagen monomers occurs from the carboxyl to the amino terminus (13Dolz R. Engel J. Kuhn K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 178: 357-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), similar to other collagens (14Engel J. Prockop D.J. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1991; 20: 137-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), a prime candidate for this recognition function is the NC1 domain. In fibrillar collagens, sequences in the C-propeptide analogous to the NC1 domain of type IV collagen were found to direct the selection of chains for the assembly of triple-helical molecules (15Lees J.F. Tasab M. Bulleid N.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 908-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In type X collagen, the NC1 domain plays a critical role in both triple-helix formation and network formation (16Zhang Y. Chen Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22409-22413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and mutations in this domain prevent the assembly of the type X collagen network, leading to Schmidt's metaphyseal chondrodysplasia (17Chan D. Cole W.G. Rogers J.G. Bateman J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4558-4562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 18Dublet B. Vernet T. van der Rest M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18909-18915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In the present study, the NC1 domain of type IV collagen was investigated to determine whether it possesses discriminatory structural features important for the assembly of the two distinct networks in GBM. This was investigated by comparing the chain composition of native GBM hexamers with that of GBM hexamers reconstituted in vitro and with NC1 hexamers assembled in vitro from purified α1–α5(IV) NC1 monomers. The findings indicate that the NC1 monomers contain recognition sequences for selection of chains and monomers that are sufficient to encode the assembly of the α1·α2(IV) and α3·α4·α5(IV) networks of GBM. Moreover, mutations in the NC1 domain of the α3–α5(IV) chains in Alport syndrome may disrupt the assembly of the α3·α4·α5(IV) network by interfering with the assembly of the α3·α4·α5 NC1 hexamer. Frozen bovine kidneys, testes, and eye lenses were purchased from Pel-Freeze Biological (Rogers, AR) and stored at −20 °C. Human kidneys not suitable for transplantation were obtained from Midwest Organ Bank and stored frozen at −70 °C. NC1 hexamers were prepared by digestion with bacterial collagenase of human GBM (19Wieslander J. Kataja M. Hudson B.G. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1987; 69: 332-340PubMed Google Scholar) and of bovine GBM (20Wieslander J. Langeveld J. Butkowski R. Jodlowski M. Noelken M. Hudson B.G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 14088-14094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), followed by purification on DE-52 and S-300. The α1(IV) and α2(IV) NC1 monomers were separated from the LBM NC1 hexamer by chromatofocusing on an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Mono P column (23Timoneda J. Gunwar S. Monfort G. Saus J. Noelken M.E. Hudson B.G. Connect. Tissue Res. 1990; 24: 169-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Bovine α3(IV) NC1 domain was prepared from STBM by HPLC, using a C18reverse-phase column (201 TP 104, 10 Fm, from Vydac), as described for its GBM counterpart (24Butkowski R.J. Langeveld J.P. Wieslander J. Hamilton J. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7874-7877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Saus J. Wieslander J. Langeveld J.P. Quinones S. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13374-13380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant human α3(IV), α4(IV), and α5(IV) NC1 monomers (r-α3/4/5) were expressed in human kidney 293 cells and purified as described previously (26Sado Y. Boutaud A. Kagawa M. Naito I. Ninomiya Y. Hudson B.G. Kidney Int. 1998; 53: 664-671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). For some experiments, the FLAG peptide was removed from the recombinant α(IV) NC1 domains by digestion with enterokinase (Invitrogen), following the manufacturer's instructions. Native GBM NC1 hexamers were dissociated by dilution (<50 μg/ml) into a solution of 50 mm formic acid buffered at pH 3.0 with Tris base. Under these conditions, complete dissociation to NC1 monomers and dimers occurred, as verified by HPLC gel filtration using a Bio-Sil TSK250 column (Bio-Rad) with a length of 60 cm. The absence of salt from the buffer was necessary for complete hexamer dissociation. Reassembly of the dissociated NC1 domains was performed by changing the buffer to Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) by repeated dilution-concentration cycles in Centricon-10 concentrators (Millipore Corp.). In some reassembly experiments, recombinant NC1 domains were also added to the reaction mixture. After incubating the NC1 domains at a concentration of about 1 mg/ml for 24 h at room temperature, the reaction products were separated according to their molecular weight using gel filtration HPLC chromatography on the Bio-Sil TSK250 column. Quantification of the relative amounts of the various species in the mixture was done by peak area analysis from the HPLC profiles. Hexamer assembly from purified α1–α5(IV) NC1 domains was carried out similarly. In all experiments, the ratio of the NC1 domains in the association mixture was kept at 1:1. The samples from hexamer assembly studies containing r-α3, r-α4, and r-α5(IV) NC1 monomers were fractionated on a Superdex-200 FPLC column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), which resolved these mixtures as sharper peaks relative to the Bio-Sil column. The isolated NC1 hexamers were subsequently analyzed for composition by immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot, for overall appearance (size and shape) by electron microscopy, and for molecular weight by sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation. Mouse monoclonal antibodies to α1(IV) NC1 domain (Mab1, formerly known as Mab6) and to α3(IV) NC1 domain (Mab3, formerly known as Mab17) were from Wieslab AB (Lund, Sweden). These antibodies were used for immunoprecipitation because they can interact with native NC1 hexamers (25Saus J. Wieslander J. Langeveld J.P. Quinones S. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13374-13380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Johansson C. Butkowski R. Wieslander J. Connect.

Approximately 10 μg of NC1 hexamers, native or reassembled in vitro, were incubated with either Mab1 or with Mab3 (100 μl) for 1 h at room temperature. The immune complexes were collected on protein G-Sepharose (30-μl beads) by gentle mixing for 1 h at room temperature and then solubilized in sample buffer for 10 min at 90 °C. Each sample was divided into six equal aliquots, which were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis electrophoresis (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar) in 4–22% gradient gels and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for Western blot analysis. A panel of six rat monoclonal antibodies (H11, H22, H31, H43, H52, and H63) previously described (30Ninomiya Y. Kagawa M. Iyama K. Naito I. Kishiro Y. Seyer J.M. Sugimoto M. Oohashi T. Sado Y. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1219-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) was used to detect the α1–α6 NC1 domains in the Western blots. Membranes were reacted with the monoclonal antibodies to α1–α6 NC1 domains (1:500 dilution), incubated with by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rat IgG (Sigma), and then developed with 4-bromo-5-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium. Rotary shadowing electron microscopy was performed as described (31Shotton D.M. Burke B.E. Branton D. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 131: 303-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar) with modifications. The protein samples (25 μg/ml) were diluted into 60% glycerol, 40% ammonium bicarbonate, nebulized onto mica discs, evacuated in a Bal-Tec BAF500K freeze-etch-replica system to 1.7 × 10−9 millitorr, coated at an angle (rotation rate 60 rpm) with 0.9 nm of platinum at 120 K, and then backed with 8 nm of carbon. The replicas were examined and photographed in a Philips electron microscope with a 30-μm objective aperture at 80 kV. Protein samples were dissolved (15–20 mg/ml) in 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5. The H2O was then replaced with D2O by repeated dilution-concentration cycles in Centricon-10 concentrators. The resulting solution was kept overnight at 4 °C. Infrared spectra were measured at room temperature with a Mattson Sirius-100 Fourier transform infrared spectrometer, using CaF2 windows and 0.056-mm path length. The cell compartment was purged with nitrogen to minimize the water vapor background. For each sample, 500 individual scans in the range 1000–2000 cm−1 were obtained and averaged. The protein spectra (absorbance versus wave number) were corrected for solvent and water vapor contributions using the SpectraCalc software (Galactic Industries Corp.). The criterion for correct water vapor and solvent subtraction was a featureless (zero absorbance) spectrum from 1800 to 2000 cm−1. The resulting spectra were normalized to a peak value of 1.0. Estimates of secondary structure were obtained by deconvolution of the amide I′ band (32Susi H. Byler D.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 130: 290-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar) with use of the SpectraCalc software. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed at 20 °C and different rotor speeds, using a Beckman XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge. Samples were loaded into cells equipped with a six-channel 12-mm path length centerpiece, and the radial protein distribution was determined from the UV absorbance at 280 or 230 nm by consecutive automated radial scans acquired at 0.001-cm intervals. Data were analyzed after samples reached thermodynamic equilibrium, as judged by the absence of systematic deviations in the difference between successive scans taken 12 h apart. The molar mass was calculated using the equation, c(r)=c(a)exp[M(1−νρ)ω2(r2−a2)/2RT]Equation 1 where c(r) represents the protein concentration at distance r from the center of rotation,c(a) is the concentration at the liquid-air meniscus, M is the molecular weight of the protein, ν is the partial specific volume of the protein, ρ is the solvent density, ω is the angular velocity, R is the universal gas constant, and T is the temperature. The data were analyzed by nonlinear least-squares methods using the Beckman analysis module running under Origin software (Microcal, Inc.). A partial specific volume of 0.72 cm3 g–1, calculated from the amino acid composition, was used in the calculation of molecular weight. The initial discovery of the α3 and α4(IV) chains led to a hypothesis that the α3 and α4(IV) chains existed in a network distinct from that of the classical α1 and α2(IV) chains (33Hudson B.G. Wieslander J. Wisdom Jr., B.J. Noelken M.E. Lab. Invest. 1989; 61: 256-269PubMed Google Scholar). This was demonstrated by analysis of the NC1 hexamers 2In the type IV collagen suprastructure, two protomers interact at the carboxyl terminus via their NC1 domains, thus forming a stable NC1 hexamer complex (three NC1 domains from each protomer) that can be excised by digestion of the basement membranes with bacterial collagenase. Because of the special position of the NC1 hexamers in the suprastructure, connecting two adjoining protomers, the chain composition of the hexamers reflects the chain composition of the parent network. that were derived from bovine GBM by collagenase digestion and were characterized by immunoprecipitation with chain-specific monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies (25Saus J. Wieslander J. Langeveld J.P. Quinones S. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13374-13380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These findings were confirmed in subsequent studies (28Johansson C. Butkowski R. Wieslander J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24533-24537Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Kleppel M.M. Fan W. Cheong H.I. Michael A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4137-4142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In these studies, the presence in the hexamers of the α5 and α6(IV) NC1 domains was not investigated, since the work predated the discovery of the α5 and α6(IV) chains. In our recent study of bovine GBM, in which the collagenous domains were characterized, the five α(IV) chains were found to be distributed about an α1·α2(IV) and an α3·α4·α5(IV) network (4Gunwar S. Ballester F. Noelken M.E. Sado Y. Ninomiya Y. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8767-8775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Whether the α3, α4, and α5 were connected to each other via their NC1 domains has not been determined. In the present study, the linkage of the chains at the NC1 junction within the GBM network was determined by fractionating the NC1 hexamers of varying compositions by immunoprecipitation with monoclonal antibodies (Mab1 and Mab3) to α1 and α3(IV) NC1 domains. Mab1 and Mab3 were used in immunoprecipitation because of their unique ability to interact with native hexamers (21Kahsai T.Z. Enders G.C. Gunwar S. Brunmark C. Wieslander J. Kalluri R. Zhou J.

The chain composition of the hexamer populations was analyzed by Western blotting with a panel of monoclonal antibodies specific for the α1–6(IV) NC1 domains (30Ninomiya Y. Kagawa M. Iyama K. Naito I. Kishiro Y. Seyer J.M. Sugimoto M. Oohashi T. Sado Y. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1219-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Because different monoclonal antibodies were used for detection of each NC1 domain, the intensity of the bands cannot be used to quantify the relative abundance of distinct α(IV) NC1 domain within a NC1 hexamer, but the relative intensities can be used to compare the abundance of the same α(IV) NC1 domain among different hexamer populations (the blots of the total NC1 hexamers in the top panel serving as a reference, see following figures). The analysis of the NC1 hexamers from native human GBM revealed the presence of all six α chains, in both monomer and dimer forms (Fig.2 A). Since the α6(IV) chain is not found in the GBM proper (30Ninomiya Y. Kagawa M. Iyama K. Naito I. Kishiro Y. Seyer J.M. Sugimoto M. Oohashi T. Sado Y. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1219-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), it must have originated from the Bowman's capsule, which contains the α1, α2, α5, and α6(IV) chains. The human GBM hexamers precipitated by Mab1 consisted almost exclusively of the α1 and α2(IV) NC1 domains (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, the hexamers precipitated with Mab3 predominantly contained the α3, α4, and α5(IV) NC1 domains, along with smaller amounts of α2(IV) NC1 domain (Fig. 2 C). The absence of α6(IV) NC1 domain from the hexamers immunoprecipitated with Mab1 or Mab3 suggests that the α6(IV) NC1 domain is probably associated with the α5(IV) NC1 domain in the basement membrane of the Bowman's capsule. Thus, the predominant NC1 hexamers of human GBM are a heterohexamer composed of α1 and α2(IV) NC1 domains and another one composed of the α3, α4, and α5(IV) NC1 domains. These results unambiguously confirms the existence of at least two distinct networks in human GBM, and they are consistent with the previously established α1·α2(IV) and α3·α4·α5(IV) networks (4Gunwar S. Ballester F. Noelken M.E. Sado Y. Ninomiya Y. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8767-8775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), in which monomers containing the respective chains are connected to one another through their NC1 domains (Fig. 1). Moreover, the findings establish unambiguously that the α3, α4, and α5(IV) chains are interlinked with each other via their NC1 domains. Potentially, the NC1 domains possess recognition sequences that specify which NC1 domains associate to form hexamers, which, in turn, would reflect specificity in the selection of chains for monomer assembly and the selection of monomers for network assembly. This supposition was investigated by comparing the composition of native hexamers with in vitro reconstituted hexamers using the experimental approach shown in Fig.3 (left panel). Complete dissociation into NC1 monomers and dimers was achieved by dilution of hexamers at pH 3.0, as shown by the HPLC gel filtration analysis. Reassembly of the dissociated hexamers was performed overnight at room temperature after changing the buffer to Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and concentrating the mixture of NC1 domains to approximately 1 mg/ml. The reaction mixture was then analyzed by HPLC gel filtration. Under these “associative conditions,” hexamers reformed in a proportion of 89%. Only 4% of the starting NC1 domains did not reassemble into hexamers, and the remaining 7% formed aggregates with a molecular weight higher than that of hexamers. The hexamer peak was analyzed by Western blotting (Fig. 3 A) and found to contain all chains present in the starting material. The reassociated hexamers were fractionated by immunoprecipitation with Mab1 and Mab3 to determine whether reconstitution of hexamers was specific and whether the specificity was related to that observed for native hexamer from human GBM. The results revealed that the reassociated hexamer consisted of the same two population as the native hexamers, an α1·α2(IV) heterohexamer and a α3·α4·α5(IV) heterohexamer, which are immunoprecipitated by Mab1 (Fig.3 B) and Mab3 (Fig. 3 C), respectively. Mab1 also precipitated small amounts of α3 and α6(IV) NC1 domains that were not observed in the native hexamers (compare Fig. 3 B and Fig. 2 B). Mab3 also immunoprecipitated small amounts of α1, α2, and α6(IV) NC1 domains from reconstituted hexamers, whereas only α2(IV) NC1 domain was precipitated from the native hexamers. Overall, these results reveal that the two hexamer subpopulations reassembled in vitro have essentially the same composition profile with respect to the α1 and α3(IV) NC1 domains as those from native human GBM. This suggests that the chain specificity for the assembly of the α1·α2(IV) and α3·α4·α5(IV) networks of human GBM is encoded in the α1–α5(IV) NC1 domains. Due to the limited availability of human NC1 domains for subsequent investigations, studies were also conducted using NC1 domains isolated from bovine GBM. As shown in Fig.4, A–C, native bovine NC1 hexamers occurred primarily in two subpopulations, an α1·α2(IV) heterohexamer and an α3·α4·α5(IV) heterohexamer, analogous to those of human GBM. For bovine hexamers, Mab1 also immunoprecipitated small amounts of α3, α4, and α5(IV) NC1 domains, which in contrast were not precipitated from human hexamers (compare Figs.4 B and 2 B). Likewise, Mab3 immunoprecipitated a sm"

Several protein kinases have been implicated in eNOS regulation, but the role of MAP kinases remains less well understood. We explored the interactions between eNOS and components of the MAP kinase pathway in bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC). Using co-immunoprecipitation experiments, we isolated eNOS in a complex with the MAP kinases extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) as well as the protein kinases Raf-1 and Akt. Within minutes of adding bradykinin to BAEC, the eNOS-Raf-1-ERK-Akt heteromeric complex dissociated, and it subsequently reassociated following more prolonged agonist stimulation. Bradykinin treatment of BAEC led to the activation of ERK, associated with an increase in phosphorylation of eNOS; phosphorylation of eNOS by ERK in vitro significantly reduced eNOS enzyme activity. Evidence for the direct phosphorylation of eNOS by MAP kinase in BAEC came from “back-phosphorylation” experiments using [γ-32P]ATP and ERK in vitro to phosphorylate eNOS isolated from cells previously treated with bradykinin or the MAP kinase inhibitor PD98059. The ERK-catalyzed in vitro 32P phosphorylation of eNOS isolated from BAEC treated with bradykinin was significantly attenuated compared with untreated cells, indicating that bradykinin treatment led to the phosphorylation of ERK-sensitive sites in cells. Conversely, eNOS isolated from endothelial cells pretreated with the MAP kinase inhibitor PD98059 showed increased ERK-promoted phosphorylation in vitro. Taken together, our results suggest that bradykinin-induced activation of ERK leads to eNOS phosphorylation and enzyme inhibition, a process influenced by the reversible associations of members of the MAP kinase pathway with eNOS.

The complex array of bradykinin's cellular responses is mediated by diverse signaling pathways, including stimulation of the MAP1 kinase cascade and activation of the endothelial isoform of nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). Several essential transducers of the bradykinin response, the bradykinin B2 receptor (2De Weerd W.F.C. Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. J. Biol.

A. 1997; 94: 13666-13670Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), and eNOS, all can be localized in plasmalemmal caveolae in endothelial cells. Plasmalemmal caveolae serve as sites for the sequestration of diverse signaling proteins, including G protein-coupled receptors, growth factor receptors, G proteins, protein kinases, and nitric-oxide synthases (for a review, see Ref. 4Shaul P.W. Anderson R.G.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L843-L851PubMed Google Scholar). Caveolae represent spatially restricted membrane domains that may serve to coordinate signaling pathways and provide an additional level of discrimination and control in the cell's response to receptor-mediated activation of specific intracellular effectors. Caveolae-targeted proteins have been broadly implicated both in eNOS regulation and in signaling by components of the MAP kinase cascade (reviewed in Refs. 4Shaul P.W. Anderson R.G.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L843-L851PubMed Google Scholar and 5Couet J. Li S. Okamoto T. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1997; 7: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). These facts suggested to us that there may be dynamic interactions of these signaling pathways that are modulated by the bradykinin B2 receptor. The endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) is a Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent enzyme that has been identified as an important determinant of vascular tone and platelet function. It has been established that bradykinin is a key endogenous activator of eNOS via B2 receptor-mediated increases in intracellular Ca2+ consequent to the G protein-dependent activation of phospholipase C and the stimulation of downstream Ca2+-mobilizing pathways (6Mombouli J.-V. Vanhoutte P.M. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 1999; 31: 61-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). It has also been clearly shown that bradykinin treatment of different cell types leads to activation of the MAP kinase cascade (7Jaffa A.A. Miller B.S. Rosenzweig S.A. Naidu P.S. Velarde V. Mayfield R.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F916-F924PubMed Google Scholar, 8Graness A. Adomeit A. Heinze R. Wetzker R. Leibmann C. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Receptor-mediated stimulation of the MAP kinase pathway can be initiated by activation of the GTP-binding protein Ras; activated Ras then recruits the kinase Raf-1 to the plasma membrane, leading to Raf-1 phosphorylation and ultimately to the phosphorylation and activation of MAP kinases including ERK (10Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3173) Google Scholar, 11Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

An alternative pathway for MAP kinase activation by G protein-coupled receptors is independent of Ras and instead involves protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation of Raf-1 (13Kolch W. Heidecker G. Kochs G. Hummel R. Vahidi H. Mischak H. Finkenzeller G. Marme D. Rapp U.R. Nature. 1993; 364: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar). In addition to the existence of such stimulus-specific pathways for activation of MAP kinases, the signaling responses downstream from MAP kinase can be importantly influenced by cell-specific protein interactions, adding to the complexity of this kinase cascade. In cultured vascular endothelial cells, bradykinin treatment has been found to activate the extracellular signal-regulated kinases ERK1 and ERK2 (14Fleming I. Fisslthaler B. Busse R. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 522-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), also known as the p42/44 MAP kinase. ERK itself is phosphorylated following the upstream activation (by phosphorylation) of protein kinases Raf-1 and MAP kinase/ERK kinase (MEK). The interrelationships of eNOS and MAP kinase pathways are less well understood. Although there are numerous putative MAP kinase phosphorylation consensus sequences in the eNOS molecule, it has not been previously established that eNOS itself is directly phosphorylated by MAP kinase in cells. Several other protein kinases have been more directly implicated in eNOS regulation, including kinase Akt (15Fulton D. Gratton J.-P. McCabe T.J. Fontana J. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Franke T.F.

The proximity of eNOS and MAP kinases within plasmalemmal caveolae may facilitate their interactions and coordinate the regulation of these complex signaling pathways, both of which are known to be separately activated by bradykinin. In the present studies, we explore the role of bradykinin in modulating the interactions between eNOS and members of the MAP kinase pathway in cultured endothelial cells, and we also provide evidence indicating that ERK inhibits eNOS by phosphorylating the enzyme in endothelial cells.

Following various drug treatments as shown below, the BAEC were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, harvested in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 2 mm Na3VO4, 1 mmNaF, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml antipain, 2 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 2 μg/ml lima bean trypsin inhibitor), solubilized for 30 min at 4 °C, and centrifuged at 14,000 × g, 15 min. For immunoprecipitation using the eNOS monoclonal antibody, aliquots of cell homogenates were incubated with eNOS antibody at a final concentration of 4 μg/ml. After 1 h at 4 °C, protein G-Sepharose beads (80 μl of a 50% slurry) were added to the supernatant for a further 1-h incubation at 4 °C. Bound immune complexes were washed three times with buffer A and then eluted by boiling in electrophoresis sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE on 9% gels, transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, and then probed in immunoblots using eNOS, c-Raf-1, MAP kinase, or Akt antibodies using protocols provided by the suppliers. Immunoprecipitations using the 12CA5 antibody directed against the HA epitope tag were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. For immunoblot analyses of cell lysates, 10–20 mg of cellular protein was resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with antibodies as indicated. For the phospho-MAP kinase immunoblotting, the membranes were blocked for 4 h in 10 mm Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T) and 5% skim milk. After the membranes had been washed with TBS-T, antibody against phosphorylated MAP kinase (0.2 μg/ml) was added in TBS-T containing 0.1% skim milk for 2 h. After washing of the membranes with TBS-T, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Pierce) was added at a 1:10,000 dilution in TBS-T and incubated for 1 h. After a final washing of the membranes with TBS-T, proteins were visualized with SuperSignal Western blot analysis system from Pierce. Immunoblot analyses using the phospho-Akt antibody were performed according to the protocol provided by the supplier. BAEC were harvested, lysed, and immunoprecipitated with eNOS antibodies, and the immune complexes were isolated using protein G-Sepharose and washed as described above. The eNOS immune complexes were incubated with recombinant ERK2 (0.1 μg) in “phosphorylation buffer” (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 25 μm ATP, and 2.5 μCi of γ-[32P]ATP at 30 °C for 30 min, in a final concentration of 40 μl). The reaction was stopped by adding 15 μl of 5× concentrated electrophoresis sample buffer. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membrane, and analyzed by autoradiography. NOS activity was assessed as described previously using anion exchange chromatography to measure the conversion of l-[3H]arginine intol-[3H]citrulline (24Balligand J.L. Kobzik L. Han X. Kaye D.M. Belhassen L. O'Hara D.S Kelly R.A. Smith T.W. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14582-14586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, the immunoprecipitated proteins were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 μm tetrahydrobiopterin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm CaCl2, 4 μm flavin mononucleotide, 4 μm flavin adenine dinucleotide, 0.5 μml-arginine, 1 mmβ-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, reduced form, and 0.2 μCi of l-[3H]arginine. The reaction was stopped by the addition of ice-cold sodium acetate (20 mm, pH 5.5) containing 1 mml-citrulline, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, and thel-[3H]citrulline content was determined by anion exchange chromatography. BAEC were incubated in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 80 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphoric acid (9000 Ci/mmol) for 4 h, exposed to drugs as indicated, and then harvested and immunoprecipitated with eNOS antibody as described above. The phosphorylated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membrane, and analyzed by autoradiography. The membrane was later probed by immunoblotting with the eNOS antibody to validate the identification of the eNOS band. BAEC were exposed to drugs as indicated and then harvested and solubilized with detergent as described above; the soluble preparation was then immunoprecipitated with eNOS antibody and protein G-Sepharose, and the complexes were washed three times. eNOS phosphorylation was performed using recombinant ERK and [γ-32P]ATP as described above. The reaction was stopped by adding 15 μl of 5× concentrated electrophoresis sample buffer. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membrane, and analyzed by autoradiography. The membrane was later probed by immunoblotting with the eNOS antibody to validate the identification of the eNOS band. We began our exploration of the possible associations between eNOS and signaling proteins of the MAP kinase pathway by performing a series of co-immunoprecipitation experiments in endothelial cells treated with bradykinin. In resting endothelial cells, we found that immunoprecipitation of the solubilized cell lysate with eNOS antibodies leads to the co-immunoprecipitation of the kinases Raf-1 (Fig.1) and ERK (Fig.2). After adding bradykinin (1 μm) to BAEC, the complex between eNOS and Raf-1 (Fig. 1) or ERK (Fig. 2) dissociates within 5 min; the heteromeric complex reforms between 10 and 15 min following the addition of bradykinin. The effect of bradykinin is blocked by the B2 receptor antagonist HOE140; nonimmune serum does not lead to any co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1). The bradykinin-induced dissociation of the complex of eNOS with Raf-1 (Fig. 1) or with ERK1/ERK2 (Fig. 2) shows a similar dose dependence, with an EC50 for bradykinin of ∼30 nm for all three proteins (Fig. 2). As seen in the eNOS immunoblots, there is no change in the recovery of eNOS itself following the various drug treatments (Figs. 1 and 2).Figure 2Effects of bradykinin on interactions of eNOS with ERK. Shown are the results of co-immunoprecipitation experiments performed in BAEC treated with bradykinin as indicated; immunoprecipitates are isolated using the eNOS antibody, and the immune complexes are resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with the ERK antibody as described in detail under “Experimental Procedures.” A, time course of the effects of bradykinin on eNOS-ERK co-immunoprecipitation from BAEC. Cells were incubated with bradykinin (1 μm) for the indicated times; eNOS was immunoprecipitated (IP), and immunoblot (IB) analysis was performed with ERK and eNOS antibodies as shown. The experiment shown is representative of four independent experiments. B, bradykinin dose response for eNOS-ERK dissociation. BAEC were incubated with indicated concentrations of bradykinin for 5 min, and eNOS was immunoprecipitated, resolved on SDS-PAGE, and subjected to immunoblot analysis using the ERK antibody. The experiment shown is representative of four independent experiments; the lower panel shows the results of densitometric analyses pooled from four experiments, plotting the percentage of the initial co-immunoprecipitation between eNOS and ERK remaining at the indicated doses of bradykinin. Each data point represents the mean ± S.E. derived from four independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We investigated the effects of various protein kinase inhibitors on the recovery of eNOS-kinase heteromeric complexes in response to bradykinin. We used calphostin C, a protein kinase C inhibitor (25Sakamoto N. Uemura H. Hara Y. Saito T. Masuda Y. Nakaya H. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar); wortmannin, a phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase inhibitor (8Graness A. Adomeit A. Heinze R. Wetzker R. Leibmann C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32016-32022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar); and PD98059, a MEK inhibitor (26Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2581) Google Scholar). We pretreated BAEC with these different protein kinase inhibitors for 30 min, added bradykinin for varying times before harvesting the cells, and then used the eNOS antibody to immunoprecipitate from the cell lysates. The eNOS immunoprecipitates were resolved on SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and then immunoblotted with antibodies directed against Raf-1 (Fig.3 A) or ERK (Fig.3 B). In the absence of protein kinase inhibitors, the addition of bradykinin (1 μm) leads to the transient dissociation of the eNOS-Raf-1 or eNOS-ERK complexes, as was shown above. However, the addition of calphostin C completely blocks the ability of bradykinin to induce the dissociation of the eNOS-Raf-1 or eNOS-ERK complexes. By contrast, neither wortmannin nor PD98059 have a significant effect on the bradykinin-induced dissociation of the eNOS-kinase complexes in BAEC; however, the reassociation of eNOS with both Raf-1 and ERK appears to be delayed in cells pretreated with the MEK inhibitor PD98059 (Fig. 3). We next studied the effects of bradykinin on interactions of the protein kinase Akt with eNOS, the protein kinase most clearly implicated in eNOS phosphorylation. As was found for Raf-1 and ERK (Figs. 1 and 2), the kinase Akt could be co-immunoprecipitated with eNOS in resting BAEC (Fig. 4). Treatment of endothelial cells with bradykinin results in the dissociation of the eNOS-Akt complex; this heteromeric complex reforms with more prolonged agonist treatment. Pretreatment of BAEC with the protein kinase C inhibitor calphostin C blocks the bradykinin-induced dissociation of eNOS and Akt, whereas the kinase inhibitors wortmannin and PD98059 are without effect (Fig. 4 A). We next investigated whether kinase Akt itself is activated by bradykinin in BAEC. Akt activity is controlled by phosphorylation of specific threonine and serine residues (27Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2476) Google Scholar). Using a specific antibody recognizing active (phosphorylated) Akt, we found absolutely no increase in Akt phosphorylation at any time following bradykinin treatment of BAEC (Fig. 4 B). In contrast to the lack of effect of bradykinin on Akt activation, we found (Fig. 4 B) that vascular endothelial growth factor, which has been previously shown to activate eNOS and to increase Akt phosphorylation (15Fulton D.

We next explored whether bradykinin treatment of BAEC would lead to activation of ERK, a response previously observed following bradykinin B2 receptor activation in other cell types (7Jaffa A.A. Miller B.S. Rosenzweig S.A. Naidu P.S. Velarde V. Mayfield R.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F916-F924PubMed Google Scholar, 8Graness A. Adomeit A. Heinze R. Wetzker R. Leibmann C. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We treated endothelial cells with bradykinin (1 μm, 5 min) and quantitated ERK activation by performing immunoblots of cell lysates probed with an antibody specific for activated (phosphorylated) ERK (Fig. 5 A). As shown in Fig.5 A, bradykinin leads to ERK activation, a response blocked by the kinase inhibitor PD98059 (a MEK inhibitor) but not by the protein kinase C inhibitor calphostin. We also found that recombinant ERK could phosphorylate eNOS in vitro; immunoprecipitated eNOS was incubated with purified recombinant ERK in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP, and the phosphorylation of eNOS was analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography (Fig. 5 B). To assess the influence of phosphorylation on eNOS activity, we performed NOS enzyme assays following incubation of immunoprecipitated eNOS with ERK (or vehicle) plus (unlabeled) ATP. As shown in Fig.5 C, incubation of eNOS with MAP kinase leads to a significant decrease in NOS activity, measured as the formation of [l-3H]citrulline from [l-3H]arginine (43 ± 2% decrease in enzyme activity; mean ± S.E., p < 0.05,n = 3). Treatment of [32P]orthophosphate biosynthetically labeled BAEC with bradykinin leads to an increase in eNOS phosphorylation, as we have previously shown (23Michel T. Li G.K. Busconi L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6252-6256Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar); this effect of bradykinin was blocked by PD98059 (Fig. 6 A). We developed additional evidence for the phosphorylation of eNOS by MAP kinase in BAEC by performing “back-phosphorylation” experiments, in which we used [γ-32P]ATP and ERK in vitro to phosphorylate eNOS that had been isolated from cells that were pretreated with bradykinin or the MAP kinase inhibitor PD98059. As shown in Fig. 6 B, the ERK-catalyzed in vitro 32P phosphorylation of eNOS isolated from BAEC that had been pretreated with bradykinin (1 μm, 5 min) was significantly attenuated relative to untreated cells (30 ± 5% decrease in 32P labeling of eNOS; p < 0.05, n = 3), indicating that the bradykinin treatment of endothelial cells leads to the phosphorylation of ERK-sensitive sites in eNOS. Conversely, eNOS isolated from endothelial cells pretreated with the MAP kinase inhibitor PD98059 showed a robust increase in ERK-promoted 32P phospho"

In addition, correlation between cold tolerance and intracellular betaine concentration has been established (9.Ishitani M. Arakawa K. Mizuno K. Kishitani S. Takabe T.

The biosynthetic pathways of de novo synthesis of betaine are poorly understood. NMR studies on archaebacterial methanogens have suggested that betaine might be synthesized from glycine by a series of methylation reactions (25.Lai M.-C. Yang D.-R. Chuang M.-J. Appl. Environ.

However, no enzymes catalyzing the reactions have successfully been isolated. A similar pathway has also been suggested to exist in anaerobic photorophic sulfur bacterium,Ectothiorhodospira halochloris (4.Galinski E.A. Trüper H.G. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 15: 95-108Crossref Scopus (334) Google Scholar). In this study, we describe the enzymology of betaine biosynthesis inE. halochloris and demonstrate that a similar biosynthetic pathway exists in A. halophila. In addition, osmotic tolerance was improved when the genes encoding this pathway were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. A modification of the previously reported glycine-N-methyltransferase assay (36.Raha A. Wagner C. MacDonald R.G. Bresnick E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5750-5756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used. It is based on selective detection and analysis of radioactive reaction products, N-monomethylglycine (sarcosine), N,N-dimethylglycine, and betaine, after a methyl group transfer from [methyl- 14C]S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet)1 to substrate. 25 μl of 0.1 m substrate (glycine, sarcosine, or dimethylglycine), 25 μl of Reaction Buffer (560 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 4 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 50 μm MgCl2, 160 μm EDTA), 25 μl of 4 mm S-adenosyl-l-methionine (45 nCi ofS-adenosyl-l-[methyl- 14C]methionine), and 25 μl of enzyme sample were mixed together. The reaction mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, and the reaction was stopped by adding 75 μl of charcoal suspension (133 g/liter in 0.1 macetic acid) and incubated for 10 min at 0 °C. After centrifugation for 10 min, 75 μl of the supernatant was removed for assay in a liquid scintillation counter (LS 6000 IC, Beckman, Fullerton, CA). The enzyme activity is calculated as micromoles of methyl groups transferred per min. Protein concentrations were determined using Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. The reaction products were analyzed by HPLC using Aminex HPX-87C column as described earlier (37.Rajakylä E. Paloposki M. J. Chromatogr. 1983; 282: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In order to detect the radioactive products formed in the enzymatic reaction, 200-μl fractions were collected during the chromatographic run and analyzed by a liquid scintillation counter as described above. The products were identified using a standard containing 1 mm mixture of sarcosine, dimethylglycine, and betaine. A. halophila ATCC 27976 was grown aerobically at 37 °C in complex medium (38.Sehgal S.N. Gibbons N.E. Can. J. Microbiol. 1960; 6: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) containing 18.5% (w/v) NaCl. Typically 1 g of harvested cells were suspended in 1.5 ml of disruption buffer (22% (w/v) sucrose, 27 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5) and disrupted with an MSE Soniprep 150 sonicator in 20-ml batches with maximum power. The suspension was sonicated for 10 min in 30-s pulses with 2-min cooling intervals. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 28,000 × g at 1 °C for 30 min. Adenosine-Sepharose affinity chromatography was used for the purification of the SDMT. The affinity column was prepared as follows. 1 g of 5′-AMP-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was swollen and washed with water as described by the manufacturer. The gel was equilibrated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase buffer (Finnzymes, Espoo, Finland), and 100 units of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (Finnzymes) was added. The gel was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with occasional shaking and washed with 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5. 18 ml of A. halophila cell-free extract was applied to the affinity column (10 × 90 mm). The column was washed with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, until the absorbance at 280 nm became constant. The protein bound to the column was eluted with 1 mm S-adenosylmethionine in 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5. The active fractions were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration (Centriplus 30, Amicon, Beverly, MA). E. halochloris ATCC 35916 was grown as described previously (39.Tschichholz I. Trüper H.G. FEMS Microbiol. Ecol. 1990; 73: 181-186Crossref Google Scholar). Typically 1 g of harvested cells was suspended in 1.5 ml of Reaction Buffer supplemented with 1 mm PMSF and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The cells were disrupted with an MSE Soniprep 150 sonicator in 5-ml batches with maximum power. The suspension was sonicated for 3 min in 15-s pulses with 2-min cooling intervals. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 28,000 × g at 1 °C for 30 min. Ammonium sulfate was added to 25 ml of cell-free extract to achieve 20% saturation and incubated for 30 min at 0 °C. The solution was centrifuged at 15,000 × g, and the supernatant was applied to a butyl-Sepharose 4 FF (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (10 × 50 mm) column pre-equilibrated with 20% saturated ammonium sulfate in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The column was washed with 45 ml of equilibration buffer and eluted with linear gradient of 20 to 0% ammonium sulfate (80 ml). The flow rate was 2 ml/min. The active fractions were pooled, and ammonium sulfate was removed by gel filtration (Sephadex G-25, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The sample was applied to a DEAE-Memsep 1000 HP (Millipore, Milford, MA) column pre-equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The column was washed with 15 ml of buffer and eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (0–1 m). The volume of the gradient was 60 ml, and the flow rate was 3 ml/min. The active fractions were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration (Centriplus 30, Amicon; Ultrafree MC 10,000 NMWL filter unit, Millipore). The concentrated sample (100 μl) was applied to a Superose 12-HR-30 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column. 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl was used as the elution buffer with flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. The fractions containing GSMT activity were collected and concentrated by ultrafiltration (Ultrafree MC 10,000 NWML filter unit, Millipore). The molecular weight was determined by analytical gel filtration with Superose 12-HR-30 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column according to the instructions given by the manufacturer. SDS-gel electrophoresis was carried out using 12% polyacrylamide gels according to standard protocol (40.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). The N-terminal and tryptic peptides were purified and sequenced by using Perkin-Elmer/Applied Biosystems Procise 494A protein sequencing system as described previously (41.Kerovuo J. Lauraeus M. Nurminen P. Kalkkinen N. Apajalahti J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 2079-2085Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The genomic DNA from both microbes was isolated (42.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar). The genomic DNAs were partially digested withSacI and ligated to SacI-digested dephosphorylated λZapII arms (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and packaged to λ particles using Gigapack III Gold packing extract (Stratagene) according to protocol provided by manufacturer. Degenerate primers were designed on the basis of N-terminal and tryptic peptide sequences of E. halochloris GSMT and A. halophila SDMT. Chromosomal DNA was used as the template DNA in the polymerase chain reactions. The polymerase chain reaction fragments were labeled with rediprime DNA labeling system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the instructions given by the manufacturer and used as probes to screen genomic libraries. The positive λ clones were cored and excised with ExAssist helper phage (Stratagene, San Diego, CA) to obtain phagemids. The obtained phagemids were used to transform E. coli SOLR′ cells (Stratagene). The plasmid DNAs were CsCl gradient-purified (43.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1.42-1.43Google Scholar) and sequenced. Primers homologous to the 5′ and 3′ ends of the genes were used to amplify the genes. NcoI and BglII restriction sites were added to the primer 5′ and 3′ ends (respectively) to facilitate cloning. Chromosomal DNA was used as the template DNA in the polymerase chain reactions. The amplified fragments were digested withNcoI and BglII and ligated intoNcoI/BglII cut PQE-60 expression vectors (Qiagen, Santa Clara, CA). Competent XL-1 Blue MRF′ cells carrying pREP4 plasmid (Qiagen) were transformed with this ligation mix (44.Hanahan D. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 557-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (8098) Google Scholar). Overnight cultures of the positive clones were diluted 1:4 into fresh LB broth supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and grown at 37 °C and 200 rpm for 30 min. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added (1 mm final concentration), and the culture was grown for an additional 3 h. The cells from 20 ml of culture were separated by centrifugation (10 min, 1,000 × g) and suspended to 1 ml of Reaction Buffer supplemented with 1 mm PMSF and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The cells were disrupted with an MSE Soniprep 150 sonicator with maximum power. The suspension was sonicated for 1 min in 15-s pulses with 2-min cooling intervals. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation as described before. Genes for E. halochloris GSMT and SDMT were cloned to pQE-60, and the resulting plasmid was transformed to competent E. coli XL-1 Blue MRF′ cells carrying pREP4 plasmid (Qiagen) as described above. MM63 medium (45.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar) containing 5 g/liter glucose and supplemented with 1.5 ml/liter of vitamin solution VA (46.Imhoff J.F. Trüper H.G. Arch. Microbiol. 1977; 114: 115-121Crossref Scopus (136) Google Scholar), 2 g/liter ampicillin, and 25 mg/liter kanamycin was used in the study. Concentrated overnight culture was used to inoculate 100 ml of medium without NaCl or with 0.3m NaCl (final concentration). The culture was induced with 0.05 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and grown at 37 °C and 200 rpm. The cells were harvested at early stationary phase by centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 5 min. The cell pellet was extracted with perchloric acid essentially as described previously (47.Sutherland I.W. Wilkinson J.F. Methods Microbiol. 1971; 5: 345-383Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Betaine was determined from this extract by HPLC as described above. 2.5 ml of the culture was washed with NaCl solution containing the same concentration of NaCl as the corresponding cultivation, and the dry weight of the cells was determined. The mass fraction of NaCl of the dry weight was determined by titration with 0.05 m AgNO3 and with 0.1% K2CrO4 as the indicator. The aim of the study was to characterize the biosynthetic pathway of betaine in two halophilic organisms,E. halochloris and A. halophila. In order to investigate the existence of the hypothesized glycine methylation pathway, methyltransferase activity was measured using AdoMet and glycine as substrates. The results clearly show that both E. halochloris and A. halophila cell extracts have methyltransferase activity on glycine, and AdoMet acts as the methyl group donor (Table I). Further analysis of the reaction products by HPLC (Fig.1 A) and activity measurement on sarcosine and dimethylglycine confirm that the organisms synthesize betaine from glycine in a three-step methylation reaction. Glycine is first methylated to sarcosine and then further to dimethylglycine and betaine.Table IMethyltransferase activities in A. halophila and E. halochloris cell extractsOrganismActivity units/mlGlycineSarcosineDimethylglycineE. halochloris0.0580.232.6A. halophila0.0230.340.93The activity on glycine, sarcosine, and dimethylglycine is expressed as micromoles of methyl groups transferred per min.S-Adenosylmethionine was used as the methyl group donor.

Microbiol. 1960; 6: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Initial reaction rates were measured. The errors were within 15%. In order to characterize the enzymology of the methylation pathway, the methyltransferases were purified from A. halophila and E. halochloriscell extracts. Fractionation of A. halophila cell extract on adenosine-Sepharose affinity column resulted in isolation of a 32-kDa polypeptide as judged by SDS-gel electrophoresis (data not shown). Molecular weight determination by gel filtration under non-denaturing conditions indicates that the protein is a monomer. The purified enzyme showed activity on sarcosine (0.36 μmol min−1 mg−1) and dimethylglycine (1.0 μmol min−1mg−1). There was no activity on glycine. The enzyme was named according to the substrate specificity as SDMT. Isolation of other methyltransferases from A. halophila cell extract was not successful. Despite attempts to stabilize the methyltransferase activity on glycine, activity was lost within 30 min after preparation of the cell extract. On the contrary, the enzymatic activity on glycine was found to be stable in the E. halochloris cell extract. After chromatographic purification, a 38-kDa protein was isolated. The enzyme had activity on glycine (0.52 μmol min−1 mg−1) and sarcosine (0.19 μmol min−1mg−1). There was no activity on dimethylglycine. The enzyme was named GSMT. The enzyme activity data indicate that the three methylation reactions from glycine to betaine are catalyzed by two enzymes, which have partially overlapping substrate specificity. The hypothesis was further confirmed by the results from an in vitro synthesis experiment using purified enzymes. E. halochloris GSMT and A. halophilaSDMT were incubated in a reaction mixture containing glycine and [methyl- 14C ]AdoMet. The HPLC of the reaction mixture shows radioactive peaks corresponding to the retention times of sarcosine, dimethylglycine, and betaine (Fig. 1 B). The ratio of the methylation products was found to be dependent on glycine concentration. A relatively higher amount of betaine was synthesized at low glycine concentration. Positive clones with 3.5- (A. halophila) and 5.0-kilobase pair (E. halochloris) inserts were isolated, and the inserts were sequenced. The E. halochloris clone contained 2 ORFs coding for the methyltransferases, which were 807 and 840 base pairs in length. The A. halophila clone had only one ORF (1698 base pairs), which had significant sequence homology with the E. halochloris ORFs. Further sequence analysis and comparison to the peptide sequences of the purified proteins revealed that the first gene of E. halochloris clone codes for the GSMT (Fig.2). A homologous sequence can be found in the N-terminal part of the A. halophila gene. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified A. halophila SDMT can be found in the middle of the same ORF indicating that the C-terminal part of the gene encodes the SDMT. Thus in A. halophila the GSMT and SDMT are synthesized from a single gene, and SDMT is probably a proteolytic processing product. The E. halochloris SDMT is encoded by a separate gene. In addition to methyltransferases, both betaine operons contained a gene, which showed homology to a number ofS-adenosylmethionine synthases (data not shown). The functionality of the enzymes was further confirmed by overexpressing the isolated genes in E. coli under E. coli phage T5 promoter (Table II). The E. halochloris GSMT and SDMT were both expressed in active form. The substrate specificity of GSMT was identical to the native protein. In addition, the E. halochloris SDMT was shown to have similar substrate specificity as the A. halophila SDMT. The functionality of the A. halophila enzymes could be demonstrated only partially. When the A. halophila GSMT-SDMT gene was expressed in E. coli, only very low levels of SDMT activity could be detected. A protein corresponding to the size of GSMT-SDMT fusion was, however, found in the cell pellet (data not shown). Truncated A. halophila GSMT and SDMT were designed on the basis of sequence homology with E. halochloris genes. Whereas expression of the truncated GSMT was not successful in E. coli, truncated SDMT was successfully expressed in a soluble form. The soluble protein had activity on sarcosine and dimethylglycine and a low level of activity on glycine.Table IIMethyltransferase activities in cell extracts of E. coli transformed with E. halochloris and A. halophila GSMT and SDMTGeneActivity units/mlGlycineSarcosineDimethylglycineE. halochloris GSMT0.580.190 SDMT0.0061.35.6A. halophila SDMT-GSMT1–565 aFor the amino acid number of truncated A. halophila proteins, see Fig. 2.00.0280.072 GSMT1–281 aFor the amino acid number of truncated A. halophila proteins, see Fig. 2.

When E. halochloris GSMT and SDMT were overexpressed inE. coli, formation of intracellular betaine could be detected in minimal medium containing glucose as the sole carbon source. In medium containing 0.3 m NaCl the amount of betaine synthesized corresponded to 1% of the cell dry weight. The growth curves shown in Fig. 3 indicate that betaine synthesized inside the cells stimulates the growth ofE. coli in high osmolarity. A. halophila and E. halochloris are extreme halophiles capable of living in very high osmotic strength. They are also very efficient betaine producers. The intracellular betaine concentration of A. halophila may represent up to 33% of the cell dry weight. 2A. Nyyssölä, unpublished results. E. halochloris has been shown to accumulate up to 2.5m intracellular betaine concentration (7.Trüper H.G. Galinski E.A. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 75: 247-254Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). It has been reported earlier that E. halochloris does not have the known choline oxidation pathway to betaine (4.Galinski E.A. Trüper H.G. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 15: 95-108Crossref Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The data presented in this article support the hypothesis that E. halochloris synthesizes betaine from glycine by methylation. We have also shown that the methyltransferase pathway exists in a phylogenically distant extremophile, A. halophila.Indications of a similar pathway in halophilic methanogens have been reported (25.Lai M.-C. Yang D.-R. Chuang M.-J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 828-833Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Roberts M.F. Lai M.-C. Gunsalus R.P. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6688-6693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since these organisms are able to produce betaine directly from simple carbon sources, the methyltransferase pathway appears to be a universal route to betaine synthesis de novo. The methyltransferase pathway is effectively linked to the cell central metabolism. The precursor, glycine, is synthesized from 3-phosphoglycerate, which is an intermediate of glycolysis. This facilitates efficient channeling of the carbon flow to betaine. The methylation reaction uses AdoMet as the methyl group donor. The production of AdoMet is very costly to the cell. It has been calculated that a methyl group being reduced and activated to an active methyl group of AdoMet costs 12 ATP equivalents (27.Atkinson D.E. Cellular Energy Metabolism and Its Regulation. Academic Press, New York1977: 72-75Google Scholar). In addition, AdoMet has a central role in cell metabolism and takes part in number of important methylation reactions involving synthesis of methionine and phosphatidylcholine or modification of amino acids and DNA, for example. Therefore the A. halophila and E. halochloris must have efficient mechanisms to maintain the balance of AdoMet metabolism. Glycine N-methyltransferase catalyzing the first methylation step from glycine to sarcosine is known from mammalian cells, and it is well characterized (28.Ogawa H. Gomi T. Fujioka M. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1993; 106: 601-611Google Scholar, 29.Takusagawa F. Fujioka M. Spies A. Schowen R.L. Sinnott M. Comprehensive Biological Catalysis, A Mechanistic Reference. 1. Academic Press, New York1998: 1-30Google Scholar). Also the crystal structure is available (30.Fu Z. Hu Y. Konishi K. Takata Y. Ogawa H. Gomi T. Fujioka M. Takusagawa F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11985-11993Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Despite the partially similar function, the properties of the mammalian enzyme are different. The substrate specificity of E. halochloris GSMT is broader, and it is able to catalyze the two-step reaction from glycine to dimethylglycine. Moreover, sequence comparison with known methyltransferases indicates that GSMT and SDMT belong to a previously unknown methyltransferase family. However, the consensus sequence for an AdoMet-binding site, as suggested by Bork and co-workers (31.Bork P. Ouzounis C. Sander C. Scharf M. Schneider R. Sonnhammer E. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 1677-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), can be found. The methyltransferases of A. halophila and E. halochloris are very homologous. Despite the similarities, the two enzyme systems are different. E. halochloris enzymes are encoded by two separate genes, whereas a fusion protein is synthesized in A. halophila. Unfortunately the functionality of A. halophila GSMT could not be demonstrated. The problems encountered in the purification of the enzyme and insolubility of the GSMT-SDMT protein when produced in E. coli may indicate that the enzyme is membrane-bound. However, the two enzyme systems are functionally related. The E. halochloris GSMT was capable of synthesizing betaine in vitro when combined with SDMT isolated from A. halophila cell extract. The betaine biosynthetic pathway of E. halochloris was successfully expressed in E. coli, and betaine was accumulated inside the cells in the presence of moderate osmolarity. In addition, the cells were capable of growing to a higher cell density. The results clearly indicate that the methyltransferase pathway can be used to improve the osmotic tolerance of heterologous organisms. Drought and soil salinity are among the most important factors limiting crop productivity. Although many plants synthesize betaine, there are several commercially important crops such as potato, rice, tomato, and tobacco, which do not accumulate betaine. The introduction of the choline oxidation pathway has been shown to increase salt and freezing tolerance of many plants (12.Holmberg N. Metabolic Engineering: Approaches toward Improved Stress Tolerance in Microorganisms and Plants Ph.D. thesis. Lund University, 1996Google Scholar, 32.Lilius G. Holmberg N. Bulow L.

Thus, it will be interesting to compare the efficiency of the methyltransferase pathway with the choline oxidation pathway for improving stress tolerance in plants.

https://openalex.org/W2065611313,"The focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a mediator of cell-extracellular matrix signaling events and is overexpressed in tumor cells. In order to rapidly down-regulate FAK function in normal and transformed mammary cells, we have used adenoviral gene transduction of the carboxyl-terminal domain of FAK (FAK-CD). Transduction of adenovirus containing FAK-CD in breast cancer cells caused loss of adhesion, degradation of p125FAK, and induced apoptosis. Furthermore, breast tumor cells that were viable without matrix attachment also underwent apoptosis upon interruption of FAK function, demonstrating that FAK is a survival signal in breast tumor cells even in the absence of matrix signaling. In addition, both anchorage-dependent and anchorage-independent apoptotic signaling required Fas-associated death domain and caspase-8, suggesting that a death receptor-mediated apoptotic pathway is involved. Finally, FAK-CD had no effect on adhesion or viability in normal mammary cells, despite the loss of tyrosine phosphorylation of p125FAK. These results indicate that FAK-mediated signaling is required for both cell adhesion and anchorage-independent survival and the disruption of FAK function involves the Fas-associated death domain and caspase-8 apoptotic pathway."

More recently, the identification and cloning of neuropeptide receptors has accelerated progress toward determining their physiological roles. Along with several other biologically active peptides, neuromedin U (NMU)1 was first isolated from porcine spinal cord (1Minamino N. Sudoh T. Kangawa K. Matsuo H. Peptides ( Elmsford ). 1985; 6: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 2Minamino N. Kangawa K. Matsuo H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 130: 1078-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) and was named for its uterine contractile activity. Indeed, receptors for this peptide and related analogues were first suggested by binding of 125I-labeled rat NMU in rat uterus membranes (3Nandha K.A. Benito-Orfila M.A. Smith D.M. Bloom S.R. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 482-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the GTP analogue, GTPγS, inhibited binding of 125I-labeled rat NMU in this tissue suggesting that the binding site is a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). Although NMU is present in various regions of the brain and spinal cord, binding sites for the peptide in the CNS have not been well characterized. Two forms of the peptide (porcine NMU and porcine NMU18–25) 2Porcine NMU18–25 has historically been referred to as NMU-8. were identified and their amino acid sequences were shown to be distinct from other known peptide families (Fig.1). NMU peptides from various species share the greatest homology in their C-terminal regions (Fig. 1). Similarly, the region of rat NMU critical for smooth muscle contractile activity was found to reside in the C terminus of the peptide (between residues 17 and 22), supporting the importance of this region for contractile activity (4Hashimoto T. Masui H. Uchida Y. Sakura N. Okimura K. Chem. Pharm. Bull. (Tokyo). 1991; 39: 2319-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 5Sakura N. Ohta S. Uchida N. Kurosawa K. Okimura K. Hashimoto T. Chem. Pharm. Bull. (Tokyo). 1991; 39: 2016-2020Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Along with many other neuropeptides, NMU is present in nerves throughout the gastrointestinal tract (6Nandha K.A. Bloom S.R. Biomed. Res. 1993; 14: 71-76Google Scholar), and it stimulates contraction of isolated muscle tissue such as longitudinal muscle of human ileum (7Maggi C.A. Patacchini R. Giuliani S. Turini D. Barbanti G. Rovero P. Meli A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1990; 99: 186-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and rat stomach circular muscle (8Benito-Orfila M.A. Domin J. Nandha K.A. Bloom S.R. Eur. J.

Commun. 1985; 130: 1078-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) are not contracted by NMU, indicating species differences in gut regulation by this peptide. NMU also regulates mesenteric blood flow and ion transport in the intestine (10Sumi S. Inoue K. Kogire M. Doi R. Takaori K. Suzuki T. Yajima H. Tobe T. Life Sci. 1987; 41: 1585-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). NMU-like immunoreactivity in the intestine has been localized to both the submucosal and myenteric ganglion cells consistent with the observed effects on contractility, blood flow, and absorptive/secretory functions (11Ballesta J.

NMU has been shown to affect hormonal systems, including a profound effect on the in vivo release of stress-related modulators from the anterior pituitary and adrenal glands (12Malendowicz L.K. Markowska A. Histol. Histopathol. 1994; 9: 591-601PubMed Google Scholar). Corticotrophs within the anterior lobe of rat and human pituitary gland contain high levels of NMU-like immunoreactivity (13Steel J.H. Van Noorden S. Ballesta J. Gibson S.J. Ghatei M.A. Burrin J. Leonhardt U. Domin J. Bloom S.R. Polak J.M. Endocrinology. 1988; 122: 270-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), suggesting a hormonal role for NMU. NMU is present in the same secretory granules as ACTH and galanin (14Cimini V. Van Noorden S. Timson C.M. Polak J.M. Cell Tissue Res. 1993; 272: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar).

Several structures associated with sensory processing are rich in NMU-containing fibers, including spinal cord (dorsal horn > ventral horn), trigeminal sensory nuclei, vestibular nuclei, and other nuclei associated with descending spinal pathways (18Honzawa M. Sudoh T. Minamino N. Tohyama M. Matsuo H. Neuroscience. 1987; 23: 1103-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Neuronal cell bodies containing NMU-like immunoreactivity have been identified in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, an area identified as important for the regulation of food intake and neuroendocrine control. Relatively high levels of NMU-like immunoreactivity were also detected in the nucleus accumbens and substantia nigra (19Domin J. Ghatei M.A. Chohan P. Bloom S.R. Peptides ( Elmsford ). 1987; 8: 779-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), suggesting a role for NMU in the modulation of dopaminergic actions. NMU-like immunoreactivity is found in the hippocampus, amygdala, and other portions of the limbic system, suggesting a role for NMU and NMU receptors in neuropsychiatric disorders. The identification and characterization of NMU receptors expressed in these CNS regions will greatly aid in understanding the role of this peptide in brain functions. This report describes the identification of two structurally related, G-protein-coupled receptors for NMU with distinct tissue expression patterns. Identification and characterization of these receptors provide the first direct evidence for NMU receptor subtypes. Rat NMU, porcine NMU, and porcine NMU18–25 were purchased from Bachem (Torrance, CA). Human NMU was synthesized by Synaptic Pharmaceutical Corp. (Paramus, NJ) using solid phase peptide synthesis with the Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) protection protocol, with Rink/amide methylbenzylhydryl amine resin.125I-labeled rat NMU and 125I-labeled porcine NMU18–25 were custom-labeled by NEN Life Science Products Inc. (Boston, MA). The GENEMBL data base SWPLUS was searched for G-protein-coupled receptor sequences (GPCRs) using a select set of known GPCRs and the Wisconsin Package (GCG, Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI). One sequence, O43664, was selected for use in ligand identification screens. Before cloning the full-length receptor, the 5′- and 3′-ends of the coding sequence were verified by 5′/3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE), using human hypothalamic Marathon-Ready cDNA (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA), the Marathon adaptor primers AP1 and AP2 (CLONTECH), and the following primers: for 5′ RACE: 5′-CCACGAAGATCAGCAGGTATGTGG-3′ and 5′-GGCATGAACAGCTCTGTCTGCTGG-3′; for 3′ RACE: 5′-CCAGCCGCTTCCGAGAGACCTTCC-3′ and 5′-GCCTGCTGCCATCGCCTCAGACCC-3′. A band of approximately 550 bp from the 5′ RACE reaction was isolated using the Qiaquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and sequenced with the primer: (5′-GCCCCAGGTACTTGAGTCTCAGTG-3′). The sequence of this band revealed an open reading frame 69 bp longer than the sequence represented in the public data base with an additional potential initiating methionine 23 amino acids upstream from the methionine indicated by O43664. In addition, this 5′ RACE sequence included some 5′-untranslated sequence and an in-frame stop codon upstream from the new methionine. Sequencing of 3′ RACE products revealed a sequence identical to the 3′-end of O43664, in addition to some 3′-untranslated sequence. The new (longer) coding sequence was named SNORF62. From the new 5′-untranslated sequence and the 3′-untranslated sequence, new primers were designed to amplify the entire SNORF62 sequence from human stomach cDNA using the Expand Long PCR system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN). The primers (5′-ATCTATAAGCTTCGGAGGGTGGAAGCCGGGGTCTC-3′ and 5′-ATCTATGGATCCTCAGGATGGATCGGTCTCTTGCTG-3′) were designed to incorporate restriction sites for subcloning into a mammalian expression vector modified from pcEXV (26Miller J. Germain R.N. J. Exp. Med. 1986; 164: 1478-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). A search of the public domain data bases revealed that entry Y52992 (Gene_P; Derwent) carried an open reading frame, which displayed 46% amino acid identity with SNORF62. A forward primer in the 5′-untranslated region with aNotI site incorporated into the 5′-end of the primer (5′-ATCTATGCGGCCGCTTGAAACAGAGCCTCGTACC-3′), and a reverse primer in the 3′-untranslated region with an XbaI site incorporated into the 5′-end of the primer (5′-ATCTATTCTAGAGTTGTAAGAGCCATTCTACCTC-3′) were designed and used to amplify the full-length sequence from human whole-brain cDNA using the Expand Long Template PCR system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The resulting product was given the name SNORF72. Cells transiently expressing the receptor of interest were plated into clear, flat-bottomed, black-walled, 96-well plates (Costar) at a density of 80,000–150,000 cells per well and allowed to incubate for 48 h at 5% CO2, 37 °C. The growth medium was aspirated, and loading medium containing Fluo-3 dye was added to each well. The loading medium contains: 20 mm HEPES (Sigma), 0.1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma), dye/pluronic acid mixture (e.g. 1 mm Fluo-3/AM and 10% pluronic acid (Molecular Probes)), and 2.5 mm probenecid (Sigma). Following the dye incubation, the cells were washed four times to remove excess dye using a Denley plate washer. The compounds of interest were diluted in wash buffer (Hanks' balanced salt solution (without phenol red), 20 mm HEPES, 2.5 mm probenecid) and added to the cell plates. Responses were measured using the FLIPR instrument and data were analyzed using the FLIPR software and GraphPad Prism. Oocytes were harvested from Xenopus laevis and injected with mRNA transcripts as described previously (20Quick M.W. Lester H.A. Methods Neurosci. 1994; 19: 261-279Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 21Smith K.E. Forray C. Walker M.W. Jones K.A. Tamm J.A. Bard J. Branchek T.A. Linemeyer D.L. Gerald C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24612-24616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). NMU1 mRNA transcript was synthesized using the T7 polymerase (Message Machine, Ambion) from linearized plasmids or PCR products containing the complete coding region of the gene. Oocytes were injected with 1–50 ng of synthetic receptor RNA and incubated for 2–3 days at 17 °C. Currents were recorded under dual electrode voltage clamp (Axon Instruments Inc.) with 3 m KCl-filled glass microelectrodes having resistances of 1–2 megohms. Oocytes were voltage-clamped at a holding potential of −80 mV. During recordings, oocytes were bathed in continuously flowing (1–3 ml/min) medium containing 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5 (ND96). Drugs were applied either by local perfusion from a 10-μl glass capillary tube fixed at a distance of 0.5 mm from the oocyte or by switching from a series of gravity-fed perfusion lines. COS-7 cells expressing NMU1 were plated at a density of 70,000 cells per well, allowed to incubate for 24 h, and then labeled with 0.5 μCi ofmyo-[3H]inositol overnight at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Immediately before the assay, the medium was replaced with phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 mmLiCl, and the plates were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Cells were challenged with agonist for 30 min at 37 °C. The challenge was terminated by the addition of 5% v/v trichloroacetic acid, followed by incubation at 4 °C for greater than 30 min. Total IPs were isolated from the lysate by ion exchange chromatography. Briefly, the lysed contents of the wells were transferred to a Multiscreen HV filter plate (Millipore) containing 50% v/v of Dowex AG1-X8 (200–400 mesh, formate form) prewashed with 5 mm myo-inositol. The total ofmyo-[3H]inositol phosphates was eluted with 1.2 m ammonium formate/0.1 m formic acid solution, and radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Radioligand binding assays were performed by diluting membranes prepared from cells expressing the receptor in 50 mm Tris buffer (pH = 7.4 at 0 °C) containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma), aprotinin (0.005 mg/ml, Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and bestatin (0.1 mm, Sigma) as protease inhibitors. The final protein concentration in the assay was 12–40 μg/ml. Membranes were then incubated with either 125I-labeled rat NMU or [125I]NMU18–25 (specific activity 2200 Ci/mmol) in the presence or absence of competing ligands on ice for 60 min in a total volume of 250 μl in 96-well microtiter plates. The bound ligand was separated from free ligand by filtration through GF/B filters presoaked in 0.5% polyethyleneimine, using a Tomtec (Wallac) vacuum filtration device. After addition of Ready Safe (Beckman) scintillation fluid, bound radioactivity was quantitated using a Trilux (Wallac) scintillation counter (approximately 40% counting efficiency of bound counts). Data was fit to nonlinear curves using GraphPad Prism. Total RNA was purchased from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA) or isolated from human tissues using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD) and used according to the vendor's protocol. After isopropanol precipitation, RNA was resuspended in RNase free water and treated with DNase to remove residual genomic DNA. RNA was quantified by measuring absorbance (A 260/280) and by using a dye intercalation assay (RiboGreen, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription from total RNA using SuperScriptII RNase H− (Life Technologies, Inc.) and random hexamers, extracted with phenol/chloroform, and precipitated. Control reactions were carried out without the addition of reverse transcriptase. Incorporation of [32P]dCTP was assessed after precipitation with trichloroacetic acid, and the amount of cDNA synthesized was calculated. Integrity of RNA and cDNA was assessed by amplification of cyclophilin or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Quantitative PCR using fluorogenic probes (TaqMan) was used to characterize the tissue distribution of NMU1 (SNORF62) and NMU2 (SNORF72) RNA. Fluorogenic probes were labeled with FAM (6-carboxyfluorescein) as the reporter, and TAMRA (6-carboxy-4,7,2,7′-tetramethylrhodamine) as a quencher. The following primer/probe sets were used: NMU1 (forward primer: 5′-CAATGGCAGTGCGGCC-3′, reverse primer: 5′-GGTATGTGGCACAGATGGGC-3′, probe: 5′(6-FAM)-ACTTTGACCCTGAGGACTTGAACCTGACTG-(TAMRA)3′) and NMU2 (forward primer: 5′-CCTCGGCGCAGCCAC-3′, reverse primer: 5′-GAATCACCAGGCACACCAGG-3′, probe: 5′(6-FAM)-CCCGTGTCTGTGGTGTATGTGCCAAT-(TAMRA)3′). Each PCR reaction contained 3 ng of cDNA. Oligonucleotide concentrations were: 500 nm for forward and reverse primers, and 200 nm for the fluorogenic probe. PCR reactions were carried out in 50-μl volumes using TaqMan universal PCR master mix (PE Biosystems). All reactions were carried out in a PE7700 sequence detection system (PE Biosystems) using the following thermal cycler profile: 50 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 1 min. Standard curves for quantification of human NMU1 and NMU2 were constructed using genomic DNA standards. Following PCR amplification, data were analyzed using Perkin-Elmer sequence detection software. The fluorescent signal from each well was normalized using an internal passive reference, and data were fitted to a standard curve to obtain quantities of NMU1 and NMU2 expression. Chromosomal localization for human NMU1 andNMU2 receptor genes was established using a panel of radiation hybrids prepared by the Stanford Human Genome Center (SHGC) and distributed by Research Genetics, Inc. The Stanford G3 panel of 83 radiation hybrids was analyzed by PCR using the same primers, probes, and thermal cycler profiles as used for localization (above). 20 ng of DNA was used in each PCR reaction. Data was submitted to the RH server (SHGC), which linked the NMU1 and NMU2gene sequences to specific markers. NCBI LocusLink and NCBI GeneMap '99 were used for further analysis of gene localization. A search of the SWPLUS data base with a search set of known GPCRs yielded several orphan GPCR sequences. One sequence, O43664, was found to be most similar to the neurotensin receptor 1 (31% identity) as well as the recently identified motilin receptor, GPR38 (33% identity). O43664 was then chosen to be cloned for use in ligand identification screens. In the process of verifying the 5′- and 3′-ends of the coding sequence for O43664 by RACE, an additional methionine was found upstream from the initiating methionine of O43664, which was in-frame with the rest of the sequence. This new receptor sequence was 69 bp longer, coding for a protein 23 amino acids longer than O43664. The deduced amino acid sequence of this novel protein (SNORF62) is represented in Fig.2. There are three potentialN-linked glycosylation sites in the extracellular N-terminal domain at amino acid positions 7, 27, and 41, and one potentialN-linked glycosylation site in the second extracellular loop at position 196. The C-terminal tail contains two potential casein kinase II phosphorylation sites at threonines 366 and 397, and one potential protein kinase C phosphorylation site at serine 360. As expected, a Kyte-Doolittle hydrophobicity plot of the amino acid sequence of SNORF62 (NMU1) indicated that there are seven transmembrane domains, as shown in Fig. 2. A receptor sequence that was 46% identical to SNORF62 was found in the public domain data bases. The full-length receptor was cloned from human whole brain cDNA and was named SNORF72. After comparing several independent PCR products, the actual sequence of SNORF72 was found to be slightly different from the published sequence. There were seven nucleotide differences, six of which changed the amino acid sequence of SNORF72. The predicted amino acid sequence and putative transmembrane domains are shown in Fig. 2. There is a 47% amino acid identity between the two receptors, suggesting that they are likely to be members of the same receptor subfamily. SNORF72 also shares 31% amino acid identity to the neurotensin receptors NT1 and NT2, 32% identity to the growth hormone secretagogue receptor 1, and 33% identity to GPR38. As shown in Fig. 2, SNORF72 (NMU2) contains two potentialN-linked glycosylation sites in the N terminus, at amino acid positions 9 and 27, and two more in the second extracellular loop, at positions 181 and 194. Asparagines 27 and 181 are conserved between SNORF72 (NMU2) and SNORF62 (NMU1). SNORF72 (NMU2) also contains three potential protein kinase C phosphorylation sites at serine 158, threonine 159, and serine 331, as well as one potential casein kinase II phosphorylation site at serine 351. Serine 331 is conserved between SNORF72 (NMU2) and SNORF62 (NMU1). Ligand screening experiments were conducted to identify the agonist for SNORF62 in Ca2+ release assays (data not shown). Subsequent experiments were then performed to further characterize this receptor along with the structurally related SNORF72. Application of human NMU to COS-7 cells transiently expressing SNORF62 or SNORF72 (but not in vector-transfected cells) resulted in concentration-dependent release of intracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 3, A andB). The EC50values obtained for the stimulation of SNORF62 (NMU1) and SNORF72 (NMU2) by NMU-related peptides are listed in TableI. The peptides that activated these receptors produced similar maximum responses and were therefore considered full agonists (data not shown).Table IPotency and binding affinities for peptides at NMU1 and NMU2NMU1NMU2Avg.

Binding K i values were determined from displacement of 125I-labeled rat NMU (0.05–0.1 nm) binding in membranes prepared from NMU1- or NMU2-transfected COS-7 cells (n = 2). The high potency of NMU-induced stimulation of SNORF62 (NMU1) and SNORF72 (NMU2) provides support for classifying these receptors as NMU receptors. For comparison, in isolated rat uterus preparations the EC50 concentration for contraction by rat NMU is 0.2 nm (22Domin J. Yiangou Y.G. Spokes R.A. Aitken A. Parmar K.B. Chrysanthou B.J. Bloom S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20881-20885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The slightly lower potency of rat NMU observed in the NMU1- and NMU2-transfected COS-7 cells (average EC50 = 2.1 ± 0.5 and 5.0 ± 1.7 nm, respectively) may be due to species differences in the receptors as well as the heterogeneous expression system. Receptor binding was performed on NMU1-, NMU2-, and mock-transfected COS-7 membranes using125I-labeled rat NMU and 125I-labeled porcine NMU18–25 as radioligands. Binding of125I-labeled rat NMU and 125I-labeled porcine NMU18–25 to the NMU1 and NMU2 membranes was time-dependent (reaching equilibrium by 30 min, data not shown) and saturable (Fig. 4, A andB). No saturable, specific binding sites for either radioligand were present in the mock-transfected COS-7 cell membranes (data not shown). In membranes from NMU1-transfected cells 125I-labeled rat NMU and 125I-labeled porcine NMU18–25 bound with high affinity (K d = 0.61, 0.72 nmand K d = 1.2, 2.8 nm, respectively;n = 2). 125I-Labeled porcine NMU18–25 identified 3-fold fewer sites than did125I-labeled rat NMU (B max = 3.8, 3.4 pmol/mg of protein andB max = 16.5, 9.9 pmol/mg of protein, respectively; n = 2) even though porcine NMU18–25 and rat NMU are both full agonists in the functional assay. This may be due to technical limitations in reaching high enough concentrations of 125I-labeled porcine NMU18–25 to fully saturate the binding sites, because it demonstrates somewhat lower affinity than 125I-labeled rat NMU. Nonspecific binding represented approximately 6% and 30% of total binding for 125I-labeled rat NMU and125I-labeled porcine NMU18–25, respectively. In NMU2-transfected cell membranes, K d values determined from saturation binding were 0.81, 0.96 nm(n = 2) for 125I-labeled rat NMU andK d = 0.83, 0.82 (n = 2) for125I-labeled porcine NMU18–25. Nonspecific binding represented approximately 15% and approximately 35% of total binding for 125I-labeled rat NMU and125I-labeled porcine NMU18–25, respectively. Both radioligands identified similar numbers of sites in NMU2-transfected membranes (B max = 8.0, 8.2 pmol/mg of protein for 125I-labeled rat NMU andB max = 6.9, 5.5 pmol/mg of protein for125I-labeled porcine NMU18–25;n = 2). Interestingly, the maximum Ca2+signal generated by human NMU was higher in NMU2-transfected cells than in NMU1-transfected cells (Fig. 3 A versus Fig.3 B), although the levels of receptor expression were similar (based on B max values discussed above). This observation suggests that there is more efficient coupling of NMU2 to Ca2+ releasing signal transduction mechanisms in the COS-7 cells. Displacement of 125I-labeled rat NMU binding allowed the estimation of binding affinity of a number of peptides (Fig. 5,A and B, and TableI). The binding affinity of rat NMU (average K i = 0.5 nm) in NMU1 membranes was somewhat greater than porcine NMU18–25 (average K i = 3.0 nm), consistent with the binding affinities determined for the radioiodinated peptides. However, in NMU2 membranes the apparent binding affinities of rat NMU and porcine NMU18–25 were similar (average K i = 0.5 and 1.2 nm, respectively). The high affinity binding of 125I-labeled rat NMU at NMU1 and NMU2 in COS-7 cell membranes is similar to theK d determined for this radioligand in isolated rat uterus (K d = 0.35 nm (3Nandha K.A. Benito-Orfila M.A. Smith D.M. Bloom S.R. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 482-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar)). The binding site in this tissue demonstrated lower affinity for NMU18–25 than for rat NMU with average IC50values of 60 and 1 nm, respectively (3Nandha K.A. Benito-Orfila M.A. Smith D.M. Bloom S.R. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 482-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Careful study of both the pharmacology and distribution of the rat homologues would be required to establish a link between the cloned receptor subtypes and the uterine NMU receptor. Because NMU was demonstrated to bind with high affinity and be a potent agonist for both NMU1 and NMU2, these receptors likely mediate responses to NMU in vivo. We propose the renaming of SNORF62 as NMU1 and SNORF72 as NMU2. The potential activities of these NMU receptors were further explored by performing a series of experiments to identify the signaling pathways stimulated by receptor activation.

Both the long and short carboxyl-terminal variants of GIT2 are active as GTPase-activating proteins for ARF1, and both also interact with G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 and with p21-activated kinase-interacting exchange factors complexed with p21-activated kinase but not with paxillin. Cellular overexpression of the longest variant of GIT2 leads to inhibition of β2-adrenergic receptor sequestration, whereas the shortest splice variant appears inactive.

Whereas mutagenesis and structural studies have shown that about half of the ARF-GAP1 protein is required for GAP activity (8.Cukierman E. Huber I. Rotman M. Cassel D.

Cell. 1999; 96: 893-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), many of the more recently identified ARF GAP proteins are significantly larger and contain diverse identifiable functional domains. Furthermore, these more recently characterized ARF GAPs were generally isolated not because they are ARF GAPs but as proteins that interact with important signal transduction proteins. Indeed, GIT1 was isolated by interaction with G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2), ASAP1/DEF-1 with the Src tyrosine kinase, and βPAP with the Pyk2 tyrosine kinase (9.Premont R.T. Claing A. Vitale N. Freeman J.L.R. Pitcher J.A. Patton W.A. Moss J. Vaughan M. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14082-14087Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 10.Brown M.T.

The rationale for ARF GAP proteins interacting with these distinct cellular signaling networks is unknown but appears to be a common feature among diverse ARF GAP family members. We recently identified one such ARF GAP protein, GIT1, due to its interaction with members of the GRK family (9.Premont R.T. Claing A. Vitale N. Freeman J.L.R. Pitcher J.A. Patton W.A. Moss J. Vaughan M. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14082-14087Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). GIT1 functions as a GAP for ARF1 (9.Premont R.T. Claing A. Vitale N. Freeman J.L.R. Pitcher J.A. Patton W.A. Moss J. Vaughan M. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14082-14087Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) and other ARF family members (14.Vitale N. Patton W.A. Moss J. Vaughan M. Lefkowitz R.J. Premont R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13901-13906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). GIT1 overexpression profoundly affects the signaling and regulation of the G protein-coupled β2-adrenergic receptor, not through altering the activity of the GRK2 but by inhibiting the agonist-promoted sequestration of the β2-adrenergic receptor from the cell surface (9.Premont R.T. Claing A. Vitale N. Freeman J.L.R. Pitcher J.A. Patton W.A. Moss J. Vaughan M. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14082-14087Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this regulation appears to require the intact ARF GAP domain of GIT1, hinting at a role for ARF protein function in G protein-coupled receptor trafficking to and from the plasma membrane (9.Premont R.T. Claing A. Vitale N. Freeman J.L.R. Pitcher J.A. Patton W.A. Moss J. Vaughan M. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14082-14087Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Thus, one reason for the existence of these large, modular ARF GAPs may be to coordinate ARF activity at the plasma membrane (and elsewhere) with other cellular signaling events. We now have identified and characterized a second member of the GIT family of GTPase-activating proteins for ARF small GTP-binding proteins, GIT2. Although sharing many features with GIT1, GIT2 differs markedly from GIT1 in exhibiting molecular and functional diversity through extensive alternative splicing.

The human GIT2 gene was localized to human chromosome band 12q24.1 by amplification of the 3′-untranslated region (based on human EST sequence W94986) of the GIT2-long variant. The template DNA was genomic DNA isolated from individual cell clones of the Stanford G3 radiation hybrid cell panel (Research Genetics), each of which contains defined fragments of human chromosomes (19.Stewart E.A. McKusick K.B. Aggarwal A. Bajorek E. Brady S. Chu A. Fang N. Hadley D. Harris M. Hussain S. Lee R. Maratukulam A. O'Connor K. Perkins S. Piercy M. Qin F. Reif T. Sanders C. She X. Sun W.-L. Tabar P. Voyticky S. Cowles S. Fan J.B. Mader C. Quackenbush J. Myers R.M. Cox D.R. Genome Res. 1997; 7: 422-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The primers used were 5′-AGAACAACAACTGACAAGGGCAGG and 5′-TATGTGATCAACTCAACAGTTGTTG, and the amplification was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Results were analyzed using the Stanford G3 panel web site. Primers were based on the KIAA0148 sequence (20.Nagase T. Seki N. Tanaka A. Ishikawa K.-I. Nomura N. DNA Res. 1995; 2: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and human EST W94986. For amplification of the carboxyl-terminal half of human GIT2, the KIAA0148 sense primer 5′-GTCTGGCTTGCCACGCAAAACCAC and the antisense primer 5′-TATGTGATCAACTCAACAGTTGTTG from the predicted 3′-untranslated region of human EST W94986 were used. Amplification reactions contained 1 μl of λgt11 library DNA from the Quick-Screen human cDNA library panel (CLONTECH) as template and used a 20:1 mixture of Taq and Tli polymerases (Promega). Reactions from individual tissue libraries were resolved on preparative 1% agarose gels, and individual product bands were excised. Purified bands were used directly as templates in cycle sequencing reactions using AmpliTaq FS reagents (Applied Biosystems/Perkin-Elmer) and read on an ABI 377 instrument. The pBSII-KIAA0148 clone was obtained from Dr. T. Nagase (Kazusa Institute, Chiba, Japan). The entire insert was amplified to add XhoI and XbaI sites and subcloned into a modified pBK-CMV vector (Stratagene) to create pBK(Δ)-GIT2-short. Additional GIT2-short variants containing carboxyl-terminal FLAG or 6×His tags were created by the same technique using primers that inserted the appropriate epitope tags immediately before the stop codon and XbaI site. All amplified cDNA fragments were sequenced to verify fidelity. To construct the “long” carboxyl-terminal variant of GIT2 containing all known internal exons, the original KIAA0148 insert was amplified to add a carboxyl-terminal HindIII site found naturally in the GIT2-long variants but destroyed during splicing of the GIT2-short variant. The long carboxyl-terminal sequence was amplified directly from a human brain cDNA library with a 5′ primer that contained this natural HindIII site and a 3′ primer just beyond the stop codon that added a XhoI site. The carboxyl-terminal fragment was subcloned, sequenced, and then ligated into the amino-terminal fragment in pBK(Δ) vector at the internalHindIII site to reconstruct the complete open reading frame. Additional GIT2-long variants containing carboxyl-terminal FLAG or 6×His tags were created by the same technique using primers that inserted the appropriate epitope tags immediately before the stop codon and XhoI site. The GIT2-short/6×His and GIT2-long/6×His inserts were transferred into the pVL1393 shuttle vector and used to prepare recombinant baculoviruses by recombination in Sf9 cells with Baculo-Gold virus DNA (Pharmingen). The two GIT2/6×His proteins were purified from infected Sf9 cells using ProBond metal chelate resin (Invitrogen) batchwise, followed by chromatography on a HiTrap-Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), as described for GIT1/6×His (9.Premont R.T. Claing A. Vitale N. Freeman J.L.R. Pitcher J.A. Patton W.A. Moss J. Vaughan M. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14082-14087Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Human multiple tissue Northern blots I and II were purchased from CLONTECH. Blots were hybridized in ExpressHyb solution (CLONTECH) and washed at high stringency according to the manufacturer's protocol. Probes were prepared from DNA bands isolated from agarose gels using random primer labeling (New England Biolabs). The GIT2 amino-terminal “common” probe was the 1.5-kb EcoRI-SalI fragment of the pBK-GIT2-short (KIAA0148) cDNA. For the long carboxyl-terminal variant-specific probe, a 550-bp fragment amplified from human brain cDNA using the primers 5′-AGCGCCGAATTCGCATCCAGGCTGGAGAAGCAGAAC and 5′-GCCCTGCTCGAGTCAGTTGTTGTTCTCTTTGGTGGTGAT was subcloned into the pGEX 4T-1 vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech /LKB) using the underlined EcoRI and XhoI sites, and the insert DNA isolated after EcoRI and XhoI digestion was used as template for random-primed labeling. For the “short” carboxyl-terminal variant-specific probe, a 300-bp band amplified from the 3′-untranslated region of the pBSII-KIAA0148 clone using the primers 5′-TTGCTTGGAAAAGATGCTAATTAA and 5′-CTTCCCTTCTGGTGCGCCTTCATC was used directly as template. For the human GIT1 probe, the 700-bp EcoRI insert of the human EST clone H50001 (Research Genetics) was used. COS-7 cells were grown at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 1× penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.) under 5% CO2. Cells at 70% confluency in 15-cm plates were transfected with 10 μg of plasmid DNA and 60 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies). Two-three days after transfection, cells were lysed in 1 ml of 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (5 μg/ml aprotinin, 150 μg/ml benzamidine, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 4 μg/ml pepstatin, and 20 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Homogenates were spun for 30 min at 21,000 ×g, and the soluble fraction was rotated for 4 h with 40 μl of a 1:1 slurry of M2 anti-FLAG antibody covalently coupled to Sepharose beads (Sigma). Beads were washed 3 times with lysis buffer, and bound proteins were eluted in 40 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer for 15 min at 95 °C. Samples were resolved on 10% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose for immunoblotting. Filters were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in Tris-Tween-buffered saline (TTBS) buffer, incubated overnight at 4 °C with appropriate primary antisera, washed in TTBS, incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or mouse secondary (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), washed, exposed to ECL reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and exposed to x-ray film. For multiple antibody probings, filters were stripped of antibodies following the protocol in the ECL manual (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and blocked before reuse. Stripped blots were stored in TTBS buffer at 4 °C between uses. The GAP activity of GIT2/6×His protein purified from Sf9 cells was tested using nonmyristoylated ARF1 loaded with [α-32P]GTP, as described (9.Premont R.T. Claing A. Vitale N. Freeman J.L.R. Pitcher J.A. Patton W.A. Moss J. Vaughan M. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14082-14087Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Receptor sequestration was determined using flow cytometry to measure agonist-promoted loss of cell surface FLAG epitope-tagged β2-adrenergic receptors (9.Premont R.T. Claing A. Vitale N. Freeman J.L.R. Pitcher J.A. Patton W.A. Moss J. Vaughan M. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14082-14087Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The FLAG β2-adrenergic receptor was transiently expressed in HEK293 cells along with empty vector or pBK(Δ)-GIT1 or GIT2. Cells were stimulated for 30 min with 10 μmisoproterenol before the addition of anti-FLAG antibody. Full-length rat GIT1 was subcloned into the pGBT9 vector (CLONTECH) and used to transform S. cerevisiae strain Y190. Yeast expressing the Gal4 DNA binding domain-GIT1 fusion were then transformed with a rat brain cDNA library in the pGAD10 vector (CLONTECH) as described previously (9.Premont R.T. Claing A. Vitale N. Freeman J.L.R. Pitcher J.A. Patton W.A. Moss J. Vaughan M. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14082-14087Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Colonies that grew on plates lacking histidine, leucine, and tryptophan and in the presence of 50 mm 3-aminotriazole were tested for expression of the β-galactosidase reporter gene on filter assays using X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside) as substrate. Plasmid DNA recovered from His+/β-gal+ colonies was used to transform JM101 bacteria, and pGAD plasmids were selected by growth on minimal media plates lacking leucine and containing ampicillin. Isolated library clones in pGAD10 were then retransformed into Y190 yeast with the pGBT9-GIT1 DNA or pGBT9 empty vector to verify that reporter gene expression required GIT1. DNA encoding the final 129 amino acids (residues 648–776) of the human α-PIX sequence (21.Manser E. Loo T.-H. Koh C.-G. Zhao Z.-S. Chen X.-Q. Tan L. Tan I. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 183-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar) was amplified from human brain first-strand cDNA using the oligonucleotide primer pair 5′-TATGTGGAATTCAAAAGTACAGCTGCTCTGGAAGAG and 5′-GCACAGGAATTCTTATGGAAGAATTGAGGTCTTGCT. This sequence was inserted into the pGAD424 vector using EcoRI sites (underlined) to obtain an in-frame fusion of the Gal4 activation domain with the α-PIX carboxyl-terminal, colinear with the shorter rat β-PIX clone recovered from the library screen (residues 524–646). This plasmid was also used to transform the Y190 yeast along with the pGBT9-GIT1 DNA or pGBT9 empty vector to assess whether reporter gene expression was activated in combination with GIT1. We recently determined that the GRK-interacting protein GIT1 is a GTPase-activating protein for the ARF1 small GTP-binding protein (9.Premont R.T. Claing A. Vitale N. Freeman J.L.R. Pitcher J.A. Patton W.A. Moss J. Vaughan M. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14082-14087Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). From the EST data base, we noted the existence of mouse and human GIT1 homologs as well as an additional GIT1-related sequence that we tentatively termed GIT2. EST clones W94986 and AA153004 appear to encode human and mouse sequences related to the extreme carboxyl-terminal of GIT1. However, the scarcity of related EST clones did not allow identification of more amino-terminal sequences from this presumed GIT2 cDNA. The chromosomal localization of the human GIT2 gene was determined by amplification of a portion of the human GIT2 3′-untranslated region, based on the human EST W94986 sequence, from genomic DNA isolated from a panel of radiation hybrid cell lines containing defined fragments of human chromosomes. The human GIT2 gene is present at band 12q24.1, an estimated 700 kb from marker D12S1583. The human GIT1 gene has been previously mapped to band 17p11.2 (9.Premont R.T. Claing A. Vitale N. Freeman J.L.R. Pitcher J.A. Patton W.A. Moss J. Vaughan M. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14082-14087Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). We also have previously noted the presence of an additional GIT1-related sequence of unknown function, KIAA0148, in the GenBank™ sequence data base (9.Premont R.T. Claing A. Vitale N. Freeman J.L.R. Pitcher J.A. Patton W.A. Moss J. Vaughan M. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14082-14087Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 20.Nagase T. Seki N. Tanaka A. Ishikawa K.-I. Nomura N. DNA Res. 1995; 2: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). KIAA0148 is highly similar to rat GIT1 throughout their first 471 amino acids, including the amino-terminal ARF GAP domain and ankyrin repeat region, but then terminates so as to lack the carboxyl-terminal domain, presumed to be the region that interacts with GRKs. The KIAA0148 gene has been mapped to human chromosome 12 (20). The coincidence of the two most highly GIT1-related sequences in the data bases being present on the same human chromosome prompted us to examine the possibility that GIT2 (defined as a GIT1-like sequence from the EST data bases) and the KIAA0148 cDNA might be alternatively spliced products of the same gene. We performed amplification reactions from several human tissue cDNA libraries using a sense primer from KIAA0148 and an antisense primer from the GIT2 3′-untranslated region. A product band of the size expected by analogy to GIT1 (1.5 kb) was observed in all tissues examined (Fig.1). However, many distinct shorter product bands were also observed that varied markedly in abundance among the various tissues (Fig. 1). From the DNA sequences of these amplified fragments, it is clear that human GIT2 and KIAA0148 are indeed derived from the same gene, which produces at least 10 distinct alternatively spliced variants. Similar amplification reactions using primers specific to human GIT1 identified only single bands of the expected size from a variety of tissues, providing no evidence for alternative splicing of the human GIT1 transcript (data not shown). Sequencing of amplified fragments allowed determination of the full-length human GIT1 and GIT2 cDNA sequences (Fig. 2). The longest splice variant of human GIT2 (GIT2-long) is 759 amino acids long, with a predicted size of 84.5 kDa. This form is co-linear with and 65% identical to rat GIT1 (9.Premont R.T. Claing A. Vitale N. Freeman J.L.R. Pitcher J.A. Patton W.A. Moss J. Vaughan M. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14082-14087Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) and 64% identical to human GIT1 (Fig. 2). Two recent reports have described additional GIT family members; the CAT2 protein is a splice variant of GIT2 apparently lacking exons B and C (see below), whereas the paxillin kinase linker (PKL) protein encodes a distinct third GIT family member with 89% identity with GIT2 and 65% identity with GIT1 (22.Bagrodia S.

GIT2-long (and PKL) shares with GIT1 both the amino-terminal ARF GAP domain and ankyrin repeats (84% identity in the first 300 amino acids) and the carboxyl-terminal putative GRK interaction domain. Various shorter GIT2-long carboxyl-terminal variant sequences identify five internal blocks of sequence (putative single exons, termed A through E) that are deleted in individual clones (Figs. 2 and3). Eight distinct variants of GIT2-long have been directly sequenced that arise from the loss of one or more of these internal blocks of sequence while maintaining both the conserved amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal domains as well as a common 3′-untranslated region (Fig. 3). Theoretical considerations predict a potential for 32 such variants in which these five alternative stretches may be present or absent. Although we have not been able to directly sequence all of the many distinct amplified bands due to similar band sizes creating mixed DNA sequences, the number of internal splicing variants visibly present in cDNA from various tissues is clearly higher than the nine forms we have unambiguously identified (Fig. 1).Figure 3Schematic diagram of human GIT2 alternative splicing. The two major variants of GIT2, the short and long carboxyl-terminal forms, are compared with human GIT1. Known functional domains are indicated. Within the long variant, the five alternative internal regions are labeled A through E. Direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction products as in Fig. 1 has identified the variants containing all of regions A-E, lacking only C, lacking only E, lacking B-C, C-D, D-E, B-E, A-E, or lacking both B-C and E. The KIAA0148 variant contains regions A, B, C, and a distinct carboxyl-terminal sequence D′.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The shortest variant of GIT2 (GIT2-short), which possesses a foreshortened carboxyl-terminal sequence and a distinct 3′-untranslated region relative to the nine sequenced GIT2-long forms, corresponds precisely to the previously described KIAA0148 cDNA sequence (Fig.3). This variant differs from all the GIT2-long variants in lacking the extended carboxyl-terminal region beyond exon E. In GIT1, the carboxyl-terminal half of the molecule is responsible for interaction with GRKs (9.Premont R.T. Claing A. Vitale N. Freeman J.L.R. Pitcher J.A. Patton W.A. Moss J. Vaughan M. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14082-14087Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), and much of the equivalent domain is absent in this GIT2-short variant. The truncated carboxyl terminus appears to arise from the use of a distinct alternative exon D′ encoding seven amino acids before a termination codon, which precludes t"

Biglycan, a small leucine-rich proteoglycan, is a nonfibrillar extracellular matrix component with functions that include the positive regulation of bone formation. Biglycan is synthesized as a precursor with an NH2-terminal propeptide that is cleaved to yield the mature form found in vertebrate tissues. Here, we show that BMP-1 cleaves probiglycan at a single site, removing the propeptide and producing a biglycan molecule with an NH2 terminus identical to that of the mature form found in tissues. BMP-1-related proteases mammalian Tolloid and mammalian Tolloid-like 1 (mTLL-1) are shown to have low but detectable levels of probiglycan-cleaving activity. Comparison shows that wild type mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) produce only fully processed biglycan, whereas MEFs derived from embryos homozygous null for the Bmp1 gene, which encodes both BMP-1 and mammalian Tolloid, produce predominantly unprocessed probiglycan, and MEFs homozygous null for both the Bmp1 gene and the mTLL-1 gene Tll1produce only unprocessed probiglycan. Thus, all detectable probiglycan-processing activity in MEFs is accounted for by the products of these two genes.

Two additional, genetically distinct, BMP-1/mTLD-related mammalian proteases have been described and designated mammalian Tolloid-like 1 (mTLL-1) and mTLL-2, due to domain structures identical to that of mTLD (5Scott I.C.

PCP activity was not detected in in vitro assays of mTLL-2 (5Scott I.C. Blitz I.L. Pappano W.N. Imamura Y. Clark T.G. Steiglitz B.M. Thomas C.L. Maas S.A. Takahara K. Cho K.W.Y. Greenspan D.S. Dev.

Cell. 1997; 91: 407-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar) and zebrafish Tolloid (11Blader P. Rastegar S. Fischer N. Strähle U. Science. 1997; 278: 1937-1940Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) were shown to exert ventralizing effects during vertebrate embryogenesis by cleaving the secreted protein Chordin, which forms latent complexes with ventralizing TGF-β-like molecules, such as BMPs 2 and 4 (12Piccolo S. Sasai Y. Lu B. De Robertis E.M. Cell. 1996; 86: 589-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). BMP-1 and mTLL-1 are also capable of affecting dorsal-ventral patterning through cleavage of Chordin, whereas mTLD and mTLL-2 do not have detectable levels of this activity (5Scott I.C. Blitz I.L. Pappano W.N. Imamura Y. Clark T.G. Steiglitz B.M. Thomas C.L. Maas S.A. Takahara K. Cho K.W.Y. Greenspan D.S. Dev. Biol. 1999; 213: 283-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). In later development, BMP-1 and Chordin have been found to have similar expression patterns in pre- and postnatal endochondral bone formation (5Scott I.C. Blitz I.L. Pappano W.N. Imamura Y. Clark T.G. Steiglitz B.M. Thomas C.L. Maas S.A. Takahara K. Cho K.W.Y. Greenspan D.S. Dev. Biol. 1999; 213: 283-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), whereas BMP-1 copurifies with TGF-β-like BMPs from osteogenic extracts of bone (13Wozney J.M. Rosen V. Celeste A.J. Mitsock L.M. Whitters M.J. Kriz R.W. Hewick R.M. Wang E.A. Science. 1988; 242: 1528-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (3307) Google Scholar). Thus, BMP-1 and related proteases may serve to coordinate the deposition of ECM with the activation of certain TGF-β-like BMPs in early development and later in the development of bone and other tissues. Determining the extent of involvement of BMP-1 and related proteases in morphogenetic events will require identifying the range of substrates processed by each in vivo. Vertebrate ECM largely comprises insoluble collagenous fibers and a hydrated interfibrillar network, predominantly composed of proteoglycans. Both large, aggregating and small, nonaggregating proteoglycans are thought to affect development and homeostasis through interactions with macromolecular structures of the ECM, growth factors, and cell surfaces (14Iozzo R.V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 609-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1327) Google Scholar). Biglycan and decorin are small, nonaggregating proteoglycans that contain either chondroitin sulfate or dermatan sulfate side chains and belong to the family of small leucine-rich proteoglycans (SLRPs) of the ECM. There are at least nine SLRPs, including lumican and fibromodulin, all of which possess a core protein with leucine rich repeat motifs flanked by cysteine-clusters (14Iozzo R.V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 609-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1327) Google Scholar). Biglycan and decorin, which show greater homology to each other than to other SLRPs, are widely distributed with overlapping but divergent patterns of expression in vertebrate connective tissues (15Fisher L.W. Termine J.D. Young M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4571-4576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Bianco P. Fisher L.W. Young M.F. Termine J.D. Robey P.G. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1990; 38: 1549-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Creation of mice homozygous null for biglycan or decorin have shown the former to be a positive regulator of bone growth (17Xu T. Bianco P. Fisher L.W. Longenecker G. Smith E. Goldstein S. Bonadio J. Boskey A. Heegaard A.-M. Sommer B. Satomura K. Dominguez P. Chengyan Z. Kulkarni A.B. Robey P.G. Young M.F. Nat.

Holmes D.F. Graham H. Kadler K.E. Iozzo R.V. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 729-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). High levels of expression in preosteogenic cells and a pericellular distribution are consistent with a role for biglycan in osteoblast differentiation, whereas an association of decorin expression with tissues rich in fibrillar collagens is consistent with a role in fibrillogenesis (16Bianco P. Fisher L.W. Young M.F. Termine J.D. Robey P.G. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1990; 38: 1549-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Although the molecular bases for the biological roles of biglycan and decorin are unclear, they may involve the demonstrated abilities of the two to interact with various collagens, other ECM proteins, and transforming growth factor-β (19Scott J.E.

Biglycan and decorin are unique among SLRPs in that they are synthesized as pro-forms containing N-propeptides of 21 and 14 residues, respectively, that are completely removed in most, but not all, connective tissues (26Roughley P.J. White R.J. Mort J.S. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 779-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Although the proteinase(s) responsible for these cleavage events has not been identified, the sites at which probiglycan and prodecorin are processed in vivo have been determined (26Roughley P.J.

The similarity of these sequences suggests that the same proteinase(s) may be responsible for processing of both proteins, and interestingly, these cleavage sites show similarities to the cleavage sites of the C-propeptides of procollagens I–III (3Kessler E. Takahara K. Biniaminov L. Brusel M. Greenspan D.S. Science. 1996; 271: 360-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 39Hojima Y. van der Rest M. Prockop D.J. J. Biol.

In the present study, we demonstrate that BMP-1 cleaves probiglycan at a single site, thus removing the N-propeptide to produce biglycan with an NH2 terminus identical to that of mature biglycan isolated from tissues. Consistent with a physiological role for the processing of probiglycan by BMP-1, expression domains of the two gene products are shown to be coincident in most developing tissues. A notable exception is postnatal articular cartilage, in which high levels of biglycan expression are not matched by detectable BMP-1 expression, and in which persistence of high levels of unprocessed probiglycan has previously been noted. The enzymes mTLD and mTLL-1 are also shown to have low levels of probiglycan-processing activity. Moreover, whereas wild type mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) produce only mature biglycan, MEFs deficient for BMP-1 and mTLD are shown to produce predominantly unprocessed probiglycan, and MEFs deficient for the three enzymes BMP-1, mTLD, and mTLL-1 are totally devoid of probiglycan-processing activity. Evidence that these proteases are responsible for processing probiglycan in at least some tissues in vivo is discussed, as are the implications for ECM deposition and morphogenesis. Peptides incorporating the propeptide cleavage sites of decorin and biglycan (Fig. 1 B) were synthesized by Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry using an ABI 431A synthesizer. The peptides contained a central region of sequences spanning the biglycan or decorin propeptide cleavage site and basic terminal regions to ensure solubility. A cysteine residue was added to carboxyl-terminals for conjugating peptides to ovalbumin. The peptides were coupled to lysine residues of ovalbumin using N-hydroxysuccinimidyl bromoacetate to yield solutions of conjugate in phosphate-buffered saline (about 4 mg/ml). Peptide-ovalbumin conjugates were then dialyzed in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mmCaCl2, prior to analysis in cleavage assays. Peptide cleavage assays employed recombinant BMP-1, prepared using a baculovirus expression system, as described (3Kessler E. Takahara K. Biniaminov L. Brusel M. Greenspan D.S. Science. 1996; 271: 360-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Only the peptide assays employed the baculovirus-generated material, whereas all subsequent cleavage assays with recombinant probiglycan (see below) employed affinity-purified proteases produced in a mammalian expression system. Five μl of recombinant BMP-1 and 5 μl of peptide-ovalbumin conjugate were combined in a 40-μl volume of 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mmCaCl2 and incubated at 37 °C for 16 h. Control incubations contained culture medium derived from native Sf21 cells or cells infected with the wild type virus. Reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS-PAGE loading dye containing 2% β-mercaptoethanol and boiled for 5 min. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 10% acrylamide gels and electrotransferred to Sequi-Blot polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). Peptide-ovalbumin conjugates were identified by staining with Coomassie Blue, and NH2-terminal amino acid sequences were determined by automated Edman degradation on an ABI 473A protein sequencer. A cDNA encoding human probiglycan, except for the signal peptide, was generated by PCR using full-length probiglycan cDNA clone P16 (15Fisher L.W. Termine J.D. Young M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4571-4576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as template, and primers 5′-ACTGTCAGCTAGCACTGCCCTTTGAGCAGAGAGGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-ACTGTCACTCGAGCTCCCCATCAGGATGTCTGGC-3′ (reverse), corresponding to sequences 169–189 and 1278–1298, respectively, of the published human probiglycan sequence (15Fisher L.W. Termine J.D. Young M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4571-4576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), plus an NheI or XhoI site, respectively, for cloning. The PCR employed Advantage cDNA polymerase mix (CLONTECH) and denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, followed by 25 cycles of 94 °C for 10 s, 65 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 2 min and final extension at 72 °C/10 min. After digestion with NheI and XhoI, the 1129-base pair PCR product was inserted between the NheI and XhoI sites of expression vector pCEP-Pu/BM40s (41Kohfeldt E. Maurer P. Vannahme C. Timpl R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) downstream of, and in the same reading frame as, sequences encoding the BM40 signal peptide. Fidelity of the pCEP-Pu/BM40s-probiglycan expression vector was confirmed by DNA sequencing of the PCR insert and junctions on both strands. 293-EBNA human embryonic kidney cells (Invitrogen) were maintained in growth medium consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1 mml-glutamine, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, and 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone). Cells at 90% confluence were transfected with 10 μg of pCEP-Pu/BM40s-probiglycan vector or empty pCEP-Pu/BM40s vector per 100-mm tissue culture dish, using LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 48 h, cells were selected in growth medium containing 5 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma), and surviving cells were allowed to grow to confluent mass cultures in growth medium containing 5 μg/ml puromycin. Medium was removed from cell cultures, which were then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and switched to serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 40 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma). After 24 h, conditioned medium was harvested, and protease inhibitors were added. Fresh serum-free medium was applied to the cells and similarly collected after an additional 24 h, and medium samples from 24 and 48 h harvest were pooled and centrifuged to remove cell debris. For samples in which unpurified material was to be analyzed by Western blotting (i.e. Fig.2), inhibitors were 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. For samples from which probiglycan was to be purified, inhibitors were 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 1 mm p-aminobenzoic acid, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 mm EDTA. Fibroblasts were isolated from 13.5-days postconception embryos, as described (6Suzuki N. Labosky P.A. Furuta Y. Hargett L. Dunn R. Fogo A.B. Takahara K. Peters D.M.P. Greenspan D.S. Hogan B.L.M. Development. 1996; 122: 3587-3595Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and were passaged no more than five times in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1 mml-glutamine, 0.1 mmnonessential amino acids, and 10% fetal bovine serum. For analysis of unpurified materials, conditioned media were dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 40 mm sodium acetate, 5 mm EDTA, and then either treated or not treated with 0.4 units/ml protease-free chondroitinase ABC (Seikaguku Corp.) for 4 h at 37 °C. Subsequently, samples were precipitated by addition of trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 10% and incubation for 1 h at 4 °C. Precipitates were collected by centrifugation, washed three times with 12.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 75% ethanol at 4 °C, dissolved in 50 μl of SDS-PAGE loading dye containing 2% β-mercaptoethanol, and boiled for 5 min, and 5 μl aliquots were electrophoresed on 4–15% acrylamide gradient gels. Western blot analyses of these materials and of the purified samples described below involved transfers to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, incubations of blots with antibodies, and washes, as described previously (42Lee S. Solow-Cordero D.E. Kessler E. Takahara K. Greenspan D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19059-19066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), using antibodies raised against a peptide (LPFEQRGFWGGC) within the probiglycan N-propeptide (26Roughley P.J. White R.J. Mort J.S. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 779-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), for both murine and human samples, or antibodies LF-51, for human samples, and LF106, for murine samples, raised against peptides within the mature form of human (GVLDPDSVTPTYSA) or murine (VPDLDSVTPTFSAMC) biglycan, respectively (15Fisher L.W. Termine J.D. Young M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4571-4576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Fisher L.W. Stubbs III, J.T. Young M.G. Acta Orthop. Scand. 1995; 66 Suppl. 266: 61-65Crossref Scopus (418) Google Scholar). N-propeptide and LF-51 antibodies were diluted 1:1000, whereas LF-106 and secondary antibodies of peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit Ig antisera were diluted 1:5000 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immunoreactive proteins were detected using SuperSignal peroxidase substrate (Pierce). Conditioned medium samples were applied to a 1.5 × 3-cm DEAE-cellulose column (DE52, Whatman) pre-equilibrated with Buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 1 mm p-aminobenzoic acid, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The column was washed in Buffer A, and bound proteins were eluted in a linear gradient of Buffer A made 250–1200 mm NaCl. The proteoglycan form of probiglycan eluted at ∼350 mm NaCl and fractions containing this form were dialyzed into 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl. Proteases used for cleavage assays of recombinant probiglycan were recombinant human BMP-1, mTLD, mTLL-1, and mTLL-2, with COOH-terminal Flag-tags, produced in 293-EBNA cells, purified on anti-Flag affinity columns, and quantitated as described (5Scott I.C. Blitz I.L. Pappano W.N. Imamura Y. Clark T.G. Steiglitz B.M. Thomas C.L. Maas S.A. Takahara K. Cho K.W.Y. Greenspan D.S. Dev. Biol. 1999; 213: 283-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). To optimize comparison of activities, the various proteases were prepared and purified using identical conditions, and each enzyme preparation was pure to the extent that only a single band of appropriate size was detectable on zinc-stained SDS-PAGE gels (not shown). Approximately 500 ng of purified probiglycan and 15 ng of purified Flag-tagged BMP-1, mTLD, mTLL-1, or mTLL-2 were combined in a 50-μl volume of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2 and incubated 15 h at 37 °C. Subsequently, 10 μl of a solution containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 240 mm sodium acetate, 25 mm EDTA, and 0.02 units of protease-free chondroitinase ABC (Seikaguku Corp.) was added to each assay, and samples were incubated an additional 4 h at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 10× SDS-PAGE loading dye containing 2% β-mercaptoethanol and by boiling for 5 min. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 10% acrylamide gels and analyzed by Western blotting, as described above. Approximately 3 μg of probiglycan was incubated with 50 ng of BMP-1 at 37 °C for 15 h, and the sample was then treated with 0.1 unit of chondroitinase ABC under conditions similar to those described above. Proteins were concentrated by adding trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 10%, incubated at 4 °C for 1 h, and centrifuged, and precipitates were dissolved in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 10% acrylamide gel and electrotransferred to a Sequi-Blot polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). Proteins were identified by staining with 0.1% Amido Black in 10% acetic acid, and NH2-terminal amino acid sequences were determined by automated Edman degradation on an Applied Biosystems Procise 494 HT protein sequencing system at the Harvard University Microchemistry Facility. RNA was isolated from ∼5 × 106 MEFs using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). RT of 500 ng of RNA was performed using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). PCR was performed using 20 pmol of each primer in 50-μl reactions, with Advantage Taq polymerase, following the manufacturer's instructions (CLONTECH), and the conditions used were 95 °C for 3 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s, 65 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 2 min and final extension at 72 °C for 10 min.

However, we found that rDsg3-Ig-His absorbs autoantibodies to different antigens, including a non-Dsg 3 keratinocyte protein of 130 kDa. This prompted our search for novel targets of PV autoimmunity.

Preabsorption of PV sera with rPX-His eliminated acantholytic activity, and eluted antibody immunoprecipitated native PX. This antibody alone did not cause skin blisters in vivo, but its addition to the preabsorbed PV IgG fraction restored acantholytic activity, indicating that acantholysis in PV results from synergistic action of antibodies to different keratinocyte self-antigens, including both acetylcholine receptors and desmosomal cadherins.

Acantholysis leads to an intra-epidermal split and separation of the suprabasal epidermal layer, which is clinically manifested by blistering that denudes skin and oral mucosa. Introduction of glucocorticosteroids into the treatment of PV patients decreased mortality from 90 to 10% (reviewed in Ref. 2Robinson J.C. Lozada-Nur F. Frieden I. Oral Surg. Oral Med. Oral Pathol. Oral Radiol. Endod. 1997; 84: 349-355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Long-term corticosteroid therapy of PV patients is life-saving but causes severe side effects, including death (3Rosenberg F.R. Sanders S. Nelson C.T. Arch.

This urges development of non-hormonal therapy of pemphigus acantholysis. The pathophysiology of PV includes an array of IgG autoantibodies reacting with keratinocyte self-antigens with the apparent molecular mass ranging from 12 to 190 kDa (reviewed in Ref. 5Nguyen V.T. Lee T.X. Ndoye A. Shultz L.D. Pittelkow M.R. Dahl M.V. Lynch P.J. Grando S.A. Arch. Dermatol. 1998; 134: 971-980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), including a 130-kDa keratinocyte polypeptide (6Stanley J.R. Yaar M. Hawley-Nelson P. Katz S.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1982; 70: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 7Stanley J.R. Koulu L. Thivolet C. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 74: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The notion that autoantibodies are the main cause of PV stems from the fact that passive transfer of pemphigus, but not normal, IgGs to neonatal mice can induce skin lesions characteristic of PV (8Anhalt G.J. Labib R.S. Voorhees J.J. Beals T.F. Diaz L.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1982; 306: 1189-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). Using pemphigus antibodies eluted from the 130-kDa band as a probe, Amagai et al. (9Amagai M. Klaus-Kovtun V. Stanley J.R. Cell. 1991; 67: 869-877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar) screened the human keratinocyte λgt11 cDNA library and found that two of the clones recognized by these PV antibodies represented a novel desmosomal cadherin termed desmoglein (Dsg) 3. The hypothesis that PV, a disease of skin adhesion, is caused by an antibody to Dsg 3, an adhesion molecule, prompted experiments toward elucidation of the biological effects of anti-Dsg 3 antibody. However, acantholysis could not be documented in keratinocyte monolayers treated with anti-Dsg 3 antibody. Several recombinant Dsg 3 (rDsg3) proteins were produced and used to test if adsorbed antibodies can elicit skin blistering in neonatal mice upon passive transfer (10Amagai M. Karpati S. Prussick R. Klaus-Kovtun V. Stanley J.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 919-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 11Memar O.M. Rajaraman S. Thotakura R. Tyring S.K. Fan J.L. Seetharamaiah G.S. Lopez A. Jordon R.E. Prabhakar B.S. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 106: 261-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Although rDsg3 could absorb PV antibodies to Dsg 3, it failed to absorb all disease-causing antibody, and PV IgGs depleted of antibodies to Dsg 3 kept binding to KC in murine epidermis and inducing gross skin blisters (10Amagai M. Karpati S. Prussick R. Klaus-Kovtun V. Stanley J.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 919-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 12Memar O.M. Characterization of the Pemphigus Vulgaris Anbtigen (Desmoglein 3) Expressed in Insect Cells: Induction of Blister-Causing Antibodies. University of Texas Medical Branch Editorial Offices, Galveston, TX1995Google Scholar). Only creation of a chimeric baculoprotein that included both the extracellular epitope of Dsg 3 and an Fc portion of human IgG1 could fulfill both goals: elimination of all disease-causing antibodies from pemphigus serum and induction of gross skin blisters in neonatal mice injected with concentrated eluants (13Amagai M. Hashimoto T. Shimizu N. Nishikawa T. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar,14Amagai M. Nishikawa T. Nousari H.C. Anhalt G.J. Hashimoto T. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 775-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Explanations of this phenomenon include: 1) a possibility that the IgG portion rendered the rDsg3 with appropriate conformational epitope, which could be tested by crystallography; and 2) a possibility that the tertiary structure of the chimera mimicked non-Dsg 3 targets of pemphigus autoimmunity, which could be tested by characterizing the antigenic profile of the eluted IgG. Neither possibility was tested. Recently, it has become evident that anti-Dsg 3 antibody alone is not sufficient to cause skin blisters (15Mahoney M.G. Wang Z. Rothenberger K. Koch P.J. Amagai M. Stanley J.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 461-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). A role for an autoantibody to another desmosomal cadherin, Dsg1, was proposed to explain skin blisters in PV patients (16Udey M.C. Stanley J.R. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1999; 282: 572-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). However, well-documented cases of generalized disease in PV patients lacking Dsg1 antibody (17Ding X. Diaz L.A. Fairley J.A. Guidice G.J. Liu Z. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1999; 112: 739-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) argued in favor of the existence of a yet unidentified disease-causing non-Dsg1/Dsg 3 antibody that could have been nonspecifically preabsorbed with rDsg3-Ig constructs. Furthermore, intraperitoneal injection of the PV IgG, which did not have anti-Dsg1 activity, into neonatal Dsg3 knockout mice (i.e. Dsg3 null mice) resulted in gross skin blisters (5Nguyen V.T. Lee T.X. Ndoye A. Shultz L.D. Pittelkow M.R. Dahl M.V. Lynch P.J. Grando S.A. Arch. Dermatol. 1998; 134: 971-980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It should be mentioned that neonatal Dsg3 null mice lack the true PV phenotype, in that they do not develop spontaneous skin blisters (5Nguyen V.T. Lee T.X. Ndoye A. Shultz L.D. Pittelkow M.R. Dahl M.V. Lynch P.J. Grando S.A. Arch. Dermatol. 1998; 134: 971-980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Koch P.J. Mahoney M.G. Ishikawa H. Pulkkinen L. Uitto J. Shultz L. Murphy G.F. Whitaker-Menezes D. Stanley J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1091-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), which has already justified their use in passive transfer experiments by different research groups studying the nature of disease-causing PV antibodies (5Nguyen V.T. Lee T.X. Ndoye A. Shultz L.D. Pittelkow M.R. Dahl M.V. Lynch P.J. Grando S.A. Arch. Dermatol. 1998; 134: 971-980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Mahoney M.G. Wang Z. Rothenberger K. Koch P.J. Amagai M. Stanley J.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 461-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Recently, we have compared antibodies eluted from rDsg3 (rDsg3-His) and rDsg3-Ig (rDsg3-Ig-His), which were used in the original preabsorption experiments (10Amagai M. Karpati S. Prussick R. Klaus-Kovtun V. Stanley J.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 919-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 13Amagai M. Hashimoto T. Shimizu N. Nishikawa T. J. Clin.

Invest. 1998; 102: 775-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), and demonstrated that the two Dsg 3 constructs adsorb antibodies with different antigenic specificities (19Nguyen, V. T., Ndoye, A., and Grando, S. A. (2000)Am. J. Pathol., in press.Google Scholar). The PV IgGs eluted from rDsg3-His reacted predominantly with the 130-kDa protein band present in normal human KC in addition to a few weakly stained bands that varied among test PV sera. In marked contrast, the antibodies eluted from rDsg3-Ig-His recognized several different protein bands, including a non-Dsg 3 130-kDa band in the immunoblot of Dsg 3−/− keratinocyte proteins. Thus, crossreactivity of Dsg3-Ig-His with non-Dsg 3 antibodies explains how this chimeric baculoprotein could absorb all disease-causing PV IgG. The vast majority of pemphigus patients develop antibodies that immunoprecipitate keratinocyte membrane proteins binding the covalent cholinergic radioligand [3H]propylbenzilylcholine mustard ([3H]PrBCM) (5Nguyen V.T. Lee T.X. Ndoye A. Shultz L.D. Pittelkow M.R. Dahl M.V. Lynch P.J. Grando S.A. Arch. Dermatol. 1998; 134: 971-980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and compete with a cholinergic radioligand, [3H]atropine, for binding to the cell membrane of intact human KC in culture (20Grando S.A. Dahl M.V. J. Eur. Acad. Dermatol. Venereol. 1993; 2: 72-86Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The nature of the acetylcholine (ACh) receptor(s) targeted by PV autoimmunity remains to be determined. Addition to either muscarinic or nicotinic antagonists to keratinocyte monolayers in both cases results in acantholysis (reviewed in Refs. 21Grando S.A. Horton R.M. Curr. Opin. Dermatol. 1997; 4: 262-268Google Scholar, 22Grando S.A. J. Investig. Dermatol. Symp. Proc. 1997; 2: 41-48Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), whereas cholinergic agonists stimulate cell-to-cell adhesion of KC, and can reverse, attenuate, or prevent acantholysis in keratinocyte monolayers when added to culture after, simultaneously with, or prior to PV IgG, respectively (20Grando S.A. Dahl M.V. J. Eur. Acad. Dermatol. Venereol. 1993; 2: 72-86Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The anti-acantholytic activity of cholinergic agonists suggests a novel avenue for development of non-hormonal treatment of pemphigus. In this study, we demonstrate the nature of a novel target for non-Dsg 3 disease-causing PV IgG. Screening of the keratinocyte cDNA expression library with PV IgG immunoaffinity-purified on a 75-kDa area of the immunoblotting membrane revealed a novel human annexin-like molecule, which we named pemphaxin (PX). We produced recombinant PX (rPX-His) and demonstrated that this protein acts as a cholinergic receptor in the radioligand binding assay with [3H]ACh. PV IgG specifically recognized rPX-His, and preabsorption of PV sera with rPX-His eliminated the acantholytic activity that could be restored by adding back the anti-PX antibody eluted from the affinity column. Thus, disease-causing PV antibody identified PX, a novel human annexin that acts as a keratinocyte cell surface receptor for ACh, and, therefore, may mediate known biological effects of this cytotransmitter on adhesion and motility of KC. The sera and IgG fractions were from well-established PV patients, and from healthy volunteers. This study had been approved by the University of California Davis Human Subjects Review Committee. The diagnosis of PV was made based on the results of both comprehensive clinical and histological examinations together with immunological studies, which included direct immunofluorescence (DIF), indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) on various epithelial substrates, immunoblotting, and immunoprecipitation, following standard protocols (23Beutner E.H. Chorzelski T.P. Jablonska S. Int. J. Dermatol. 1985; 24: 405-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The serum samples were stored frozen at −80 °C until use in experiments. The serum IgG fractions were isolated using 40% ammonium sulfate followed by dialysis with Ca2+- and Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD), lyophilized, and reconstituted in PBS as detailed elsewhere (5Nguyen V.T. Lee T.X. Ndoye A. Shultz L.D. Pittelkow M.R. Dahl M.V. Lynch P.J. Grando S.A. Arch. Dermatol. 1998; 134: 971-980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The protein concentration was determined using the Micro BCA kit (Pierce). The samples of normal human neonatal foreskins that were used to start keratinocyte cell cultures were transported to the laboratory in culture medium, and the samples of normal human abdominoplasty skin that served as a source of keratinocyte membrane protein for immunoblotting were frozen immediately after harvesting. The enriched fraction of human keratinocyte membrane protein (5Nguyen V.T. Lee T.X. Ndoye A. Shultz L.D. Pittelkow M.R. Dahl M.V. Lynch P.J. Grando S.A. Arch. Dermatol. 1998; 134: 971-980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used as a substrate in immunoblotting experiments aimed at characterizing novel PV antigens. The epidermis was separated from the dermis by incubation in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma), supplemented to contain 200 mm EDTA for 90 min at 37 °C and 5% CO2 (24Ohata Y. Hashimoto T. Nishikawa T. Clin. Exp. Dermatol. 1995; 20: 454-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and harvested into a 50-ml polyethylene centrifuge tube filled with ice-cold Tris-buffered saline (TBS), pH 7.4, that contained the following protease inhibitors: 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mg/ml bacitracin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 10 μg/ml chymostatin (all from Sigma). The epidermis was then washed three times by centrifugation, put on ice, and homogenized with a PowerGen tissue-and-cell disrupter (Fisher Scientific, Santa Clara, CA) in the same buffer containing 20 mm Ca2+. Large organelles and epidermal debris were removed by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C, and the cell membrane fraction was pelleted from the supernatant by centrifugation at 80,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The pellet was solubilized in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) buffer containing 2% SDS and 5% β-mercaptoethanol, boiled for 5 min, and cleared by centrifugation at 40,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Western blotting of SDS-PAGE-resolved proteins was performed as reported previously (5Nguyen V.T. Lee T.X. Ndoye A. Shultz L.D. Pittelkow M.R. Dahl M.V. Lynch P.J. Grando S.A. Arch. Dermatol. 1998; 134: 971-980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, the proteins were separated on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA), which was blocked, first with 5% milk in TBS for 1 h at 37 °C and then with TBS containing 1% normal goat serum, 3% dried milk, and 0.05% Tween 20 (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C, and cut into 4-mm wide vertical strips. Each strip was exposed to a primary antibody, i.e. PV or normal human serum, for 1 h at room temperature and then washed thoroughly. The protein bands recognized by PV and normal human IgGs were visualized by biotinylated goat anti-human IgG antibody (Pierce) and developed using a biotin/avidin system (Vectastain ABC system; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The specificity of binding was determined in negative control experiments, in which the primary antibodies were omitted. The PV IgG fractions were isolated from the immunoblotting membrane areas that were recognized uniquely by PV IgG, but not normal human IgG, following a procedure described previously (25Nguyen V. Kadunce D.P. Hendrix J.D. Gammon W.R. Zone J.J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 100: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Briefly, approximately 3-mm wide horizontal strips carrying a keratinocyte membrane protein with a particular molecular mass of ±3 kDa were cut out from the immunoblotting membrane and incubated overnight with PV serum diluted 1:5 in TBS containing 20 mm CaCl2, 0.05% Tween 20 (Sigma), and 1% non-fat skim milk to allow antibody binding. The strips were then washed thoroughly, and the antibodies were eluted by a 3-min incubation at 37 °C in a solution containing 500 μl of 20 mm sodium citrate, 1% milk, and 0.05% Tween 20 (pH 3.2) and immediately neutralized by adjusting the pH to 7.4 with the 2m Tris base. The IIF experiments testing the ability of PV IgG eluted from the strips of immunoblotting membranes to specifically stain KC in the tissue samples were performed as described previously (5Nguyen V.T. Lee T.X. Ndoye A. Shultz L.D. Pittelkow M.R. Dahl M.V. Lynch P.J. Grando S.A. Arch. Dermatol. 1998; 134: 971-980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, 4- to 8-mm cryostat sections of freshly frozen normal human skin, monkey esophagus, or murine skin were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the immunoaffinity-purified PV IgG fractions, after which the tissue sections were washed and binding of primary antibody was visualized by incubating the tissue section with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled goat anti-human IgG antibody (Pierce) for 1 h at room temperature. The specificity of antibody binding was demonstrated by omitting the primary antibody, which abolished the staining. The immunofluorescence images were obtained using a fluorescence microscope (Axiovert 135, Carl Zeiss Inc., Thornwood, NY) with a charge-coupled device video camera (Photon Technology International, Monmouth Junction, NJ) attached. Acantholytic activity of the eluted PV IgGs, which stained the stratified epithelial substrate in a pemphigus-like, “intercellular” pattern, were tested in the monolayers of normal human foreskin KC isolated from the epidermis and grown at 37 °C in serum-free keratinocyte growth medium (KGM; Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 0.09 mm Ca2+ in a humid 5% CO2 incubator, as detailed elsewhere (26Grando S.A. Cabrera R. Hostager B.S. Bigliardi P.L. Blake J.S. Herron M.J. Dahl M.V. Nelson R.D. Skin Pharmacol. 1993; 6: 135-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). To observe changes in cell morphology, second passage KC were seeded into 6-well tissue culture plates at a cell density of 1 × 105/well and grown to confluence (i.e. for 5–7 days) in 2 ml of KGM per well. The monolayers were then fed with equal amounts of test PV (experiment) or normal human serum (control) IgG fractions, 10 μg/ml KGM, and returned to a 5% CO2incubator for a 12-h incubation at 37 °C. After incubation, the cells were fixed with 3% glutaraldehyde and stained with the trypan blue dye solution (Sigma), and the images of the experimental and control keratinocyte monolayers were captured using a camera-adapted light microscope (Olympus Corp., Lake Success, NY) Following standard procedures (27Huynh T.V. Young R.A. Davis R.W. Glover D.M. DNA Cloning: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1985: 49-78Google Scholar), the human keratinocyte λgt11 cDNA library (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) was screened with PV antibody that was immunoaffinity-purified from a 75-kDa keratinocyte membrane protein band. Briefly, the host bacteria Y1090r- were grown overnight, infected with phages from the library for 30 min, plated on Mg2+-contained agar plates, and grown overnight at 37 °C. Over 3 million plaques formed on the bacterial lawns were screened by lifting isopropyl-d-thiogalactoside (IPTG; Sigma) containing nitrocellulose filters (Millipore Corp.). After blocking with 3% dry milk (Sigma) in TBS, the filters were incubate for 2 h at room temperature with the immunoaffinity-purified antibody. The plaques specifically recognized by the antibody were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The positive plaques were isolated and rescreened until a single clone was isolated. The insert from isolated clones were amplified using a pair of cloning primers specific for the λgt11 vector: 5′-gggggggtaccggatccccggtcgacggtttccatatgg-3′ (forward) and 5′-cccgggatccatatggtaccaagcttatttttgacaccagacca-3′ (reverse). The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products were purified from the gel using the silica membrane spin-column technology (QIAquick Spin, Qiagen, Santa Clarita, CA) and sequenced in both directions with a pair of specific sequence primers: 5′-gactcctggagcccg-3′ (forward) and 5′-ggtagcgaccggcgc-3′ (reverse) using an automated DNA sequencing system (ABI Prism 377, Perkin-Elmer). Homology searches were run against the GenBank™ nucleotide and protein sequence data bases using the BLAST search program from the National Center of Biological Information web site. The amino acid multiple sequence alignment was performed using Gene Jockey III software (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK). The cDNA insert was removed from the purified λgt11 phagemid and subcloned into pBluescript vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) for further characterization. PCR was performed as described by us elsewhere (5Nguyen V.T. Lee T.X. Ndoye A. Shultz L.D. Pittelkow M.R. Dahl M.V. Lynch P.J. Grando S.A. Arch.

Briefly, each reaction had a final volume of 50 μl containing the DNA templates, 1× PCR buffer (Promega, Madison, WI); 0.2 mm each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP; 2 units ofTaq DNA polymerase (Promega); and 1 μm each of the sense and antisense primers. The reaction mixture was first heated at 95 °C for 5 min and hot-started with 2 units of DNATaq-polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.) followed by 35 cycles (or 15 cycles for cloning experiments) of denaturing at 95 °C for 60 s, annealing at an appropriate temperature (optimized for primers used in each PCR) for 60 s, and extension at 72 °C for 120 s. In the final cycle, the extension was increased to 8 min. The PCR products were electrophoresed on 2% agarose gels containing 1 μg/ml ethidium bromide and photographed under fluorescent UV illumination (AlphaImager 2000, Alpha Innotech Corp., San Leandro, CA). The size of the PCR product was estimated by using a 100- or a 250-bp DNA ladder standard (Life Technologies, Inc.). The expression vector pQE-30 (Qiagen), which is designed to express proteins containing a 6xHis-tag at the N-terminal, was used to express rPX-His. The vector was linearized by digestion with the SphI andKpnI restriction enzymes for 1 h at 37 °C, then purified from an agarose gel, and incubated at 37 °C with 5 units of alkaline phosphatase (Promega) to enhance the efficiency of ligation. cDNA from the PX λgt11 clone was amplified by PCR with the following primers: 5′-ccgcatgcgatgacgatgacaaaatgtctgtgactggcgggaagatggc-3′ (forward) and 5′-cccgggatccatatggtaccaagcttatttttgacaccagacca-3′ (reverse). The forward primer was designed to have an additional SphI restriction site, which allows the insert to be ligated in-frame with the 6xHis gene of the pQE-30 vector. The PCR product was double digested with SphI and KpnI restriction enzymes and purified. Digested product was directionally cloned into uniqueSphI and KpnI sites in the multiple cloning site of the pQE-30 vector. The ligated vector was used to transform E. coli expression strain M15 (Qiagen). Transformed cells were plated on a NYZ agar plate containing 25 μg/ml kanamycin and 100 μg/ml ampicillin and grown overnight. To verify the clone that produced the rPX-His protein, transformed bacterial colonies were blotted to a marked nitrocellulose filter and inversely placed on an IPTG-containing NYZ agar plate and grown for 4 h. The filter was then treated with denaturing buffer, neutralized, blocked with 3% non-fat milk in TBS and screened for colonies that produced rPX-His using anti-RGS-His monoclonal antibody (Qiagen). Positive clones were selected from the original plate, and their plasmids were sequenced with a specific primer to confirm that the correct PX cDNA had proper frame and orientation. A representative clone was inoculated into NYZ medium containing 25 μg/ml kanamycin and 100 μg/ml ampicillin. The culture was incubated, with shaking, at 37 °C until anA600 of 0.6 was reached, and IPTG was added to a final concentration of 2 mm. Culture samples (2 ml each) were collected every hour during 4 h and centrifuged, and the bacterial pellets were dissolved in sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie Blue staining. Large scale rPX-His production was performed in 1 liter of medium, as described above. The cell pellet was lysed at room temperature by stirring the pellet in a buffered solution containing 8 m urea, pH 8.0 (lysis solution). Once the solution became translucent, the cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 40,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The clarified supernatant was incubated with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin (Ni-NTA, Qiagen) to capture the His-tagged protein. The resin was washed with several volumes of buffered 8 m urea, pH 6.3, until aA280 of about 0.001 was achieved, and loaded into a column. The rPX-His protein was eluted from the column using either denaturing or non-denaturing condition. The denatured rPX-His was eluted with a buffer containing 8 m urea, pH 5.9 and 4.5, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblotting with PV IgG. Or, the immobilized rPX-His was first renatured over a period of 1.5 h in a linear 6 to 1 m urea gradient in 500 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, containing protease inhibitors, and then eluted with a non-denaturing buffer containing 50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, and 250 mm imidazole, pH 8.0. The purified renatured rPX-His was used in the radioligand binding assays as well as for immunoaffinity purification of anti-PX PV antibody. Nitrocellulose filters (13-mm diameter, catalog no. HAWPO1300, Millipore Corp.) with a total protein capacity of 160 μg/cm2 were placed into the bottom of each well of a bovine serum albumin-pretreated 24-well standard cell-and-tissue culture plate (Nalco Nunc International, Denmark). One μg of the affinity-purified rPX-His was diluted in 300 μl of PBS and loaded into each filter for overnight incubation at 4 °C to allow complete absorption of rPX-His by the filter (determined in a series of preliminary experiments by measuring the optical density at 280 nm of free rPX-His remaining in the solution). The membranes carrying rPX-His were blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature, after which the plates were put on ice, washed three times with ice-cold PBS, and exposed in triplicate for 1 h to increasing, from 0 to 1000 nm, concentrations of [3H]ACh iodide (82.0 mCi/mmol, NEN Life Science Products, Boston, MA). Nonspecific binding was measured in parallel wells, in which the filters wer"

In this study, the direct interaction between Hsc70, which is constitutively expressed in cells, and lipid membranes was investigated. Recombinant Hsc70 was incorporated into artificial lipid bilayers, and a transmembrane ion flow was detected, suggesting the incorporation of an ion pathway. This ion flow was very stable and occurred in well defined, multilevel discrete electrical current events, indicating the formation of a multiconductance ion channel. The Hsc70 channel activity is ATP-dependent and is reversibly blocked by ADP. This channel has cationic selectivity. Thus, Hsc70 can directly interact with lipid membranes to create functionally stable ATP-dependent cationic pathways.

Craig E.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1988; 22: 316-377Crossref Scopus (4362) Google Scholar, 2Morimoto R.I. Cancer Cells. 1991; 3: 295-301PubMed Google Scholar, 3De Maio A. Shock. 1999; 11: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). hsps also play an important role in the recovery of cells from a variety of stresses. In this process, they participate in the resolubilization of proteins that become denatured as a consequence of the stress, as well as the stabilization of cellular pathways such as transcription and translation (3De Maio A. Shock. 1999; 11: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). hsps are grouped into families according to size and sequence homology. This most studied of the hsps is the Hsp70 family, which is composed of four members: Hsc70, Hsp70, BIP, and Mtp70. All members of the Hsp70 family contain three structural and functional domains. The domain at the N terminus of the molecule (44 kDa) binds and hydrolyzes ATP. The subsequent region (18 kDa) participates in the interaction with target proteins (peptide binding domain). The C terminus of the molecule (10 kDa) seems to be involved in the association with co-chaperone molecules such as DnaJ (2Morimoto R.I. Cancer Cells. 1991; 3: 295-301PubMed Google Scholar, 4Cyr D.M. Langer T. Douglas M.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 176-181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). The interaction of Hsp70s with peptides is modulated by the presence and hydrolysis of ATP. Thus, ATP is necessary for the recognition of the peptide, whereas hydrolysis of ATP to ADP increases the affinity for the peptide (5Hightower L.E. Sadis S.E. Morimoto R.I. Tissieres A. Georgopoulos C. The Biology of Heat Shock Proteins and Molecular Chaperones. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 179-207Google Scholar). Proteins in the Hsp70 family are located in different subcellular compartments. Hsc70 and Hsp70 are found in the cytosol, whereas BIP and Mtp70 are located in the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial matrix, respectively. This subcellular localization is necessary for the coordinated action of these proteins in the translocation of polypeptides across membranes. Consequently, it is not surprising to observe these proteins in close proximity to cellular membranes (6Welch W.J. Suhan J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 1198-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 7Kurucz I. Tombor B. Prechl J. Erdo F. Hegedus E. Nagy Z. Vitai M. Koranyi L. Laszlo L. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1999; 4: 139-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The interaction of Hsp70s with membranes may be necessary for the translocation of polypeptides across these lipid barriers. In the present study, the direct interaction of Hsc70 with membrane lipid moieties and the effects of ATP and ADP were analyzed using artificial lipids in a planar lipid bilayer system. This technique allows the study of direct protein-lipid interaction using purified components. When insertion across the lipid membrane occurs, the protein may create a transmembrane pathway that permits the flow of ions.DISCUSSIONThe finding that Hsc70 can form a well defined and stable cationic selective channel in artificial lipid bilayers is intriguing. Although Hsc70 is predominately a cytosolic protein, the presence of Hsp70s in association with or in close proximity to cellular membranes has been previously reported (6Welch W.J. Suhan J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 1198-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 7Kurucz I. Tombor B. Prechl J. Erdo F. Hegedus E. Nagy Z. Vitai M. Koranyi L. Laszlo L.

Cancer. 1995; 61: 272-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). The capacity of Hsc70 to form channels is a function that cannot be predicted a priorifrom the structure and chaperone role of this protein. Perhaps the interaction of Hsc70 with lipids is important in the processes of translocation and folding of membrane proteins. The activity of Hsc70 ion pathways was also found to be regulated by the presence of ATP and ADP, which is consistent with the role these nucleotides play in the other functions of Hsc70. Binding of ATP produces a change of conformation in Hsc70 that modulates its interaction with target polypeptides (5Hightower L.E. Sadis S.E. Morimoto R.I. Tissieres A. Georgopoulos C. The Biology of Heat Shock Proteins and Molecular Chaperones. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 179-207Google Scholar). The effect of ATP and ADP on the Hsc70 ion pathway may be similar. A conformational change of Hsc70 may be necessary for the opening of the channel. Previous observations have also suggested a possible interaction between Hsp70s and lipids. Alder et al.(11Alder G.M. Austen B.M. Bashford C.L. Mehlert A. Pasternak C.A. Biosci. Rep. 1990; 10: 509-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) showed that Hsp70s were capable of opening pores into liposomes, producing a leakage of the liposome content. In addition, they observed Hsp70-induced currents in artificial lipid bilayers. In this early work, the Hsp70-induced currents were not characterized. The addition of exogenous Hsp70 to patch-clamped membranes was reported to activate potassium channels (12Negulyaev Y.A. Vedernikova E.A. Kinev A.V. Voronin A.P. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1282: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Recently, we reported that Hsc70 is also capable of inducing liposome aggregation in a nucleotide regulated process (13Arispe N. Doh M. De Maio A. Biophys. J. 2000; 78 (abstr.): 36Google Scholar).All members of the Hsp70 family contain two major structural and functional domains. The N terminus of the molecule binds and hydrolyzes ATP, and the C terminus participates in the interaction with target proteins (peptide binding domain) (2Morimoto R.I. Cancer Cells. 1991; 3: 295-301PubMed Google Scholar). Members of the Hsp70 family self-associate to form oligomers of low order in the absence of peptide targets or denatured proteins, also in an ATP-dependent manner (14Schlossman D.M. Schmid S.L. Brael W.A. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 723-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 15Freiden P.J. Gaut J.R. Hendershot L.M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 16792-16797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The C terminus of Hsc70 has been shown to be essential for self-association (18Benaroudj N. Fouchaq B. Ladjimi M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8744-8751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). It is quite likely that the actual Hsc70 channel may be formed by oligomers of this protein. The characteristic multiconductance nature and the various patterns of channel activity observed after incorporation of Hsc70 into the lipid bilayer may be the result of the incorporation of different order oligomers. However, we cannot discard the possibility that multiconductance is due to conformational changes of Hsc70. These oligomers may be inserted into the lipid bilayer by the C terminus of the molecule. This assumption is based on the observation that channel activity is reversibly regulated by ATP and ADP. Thus, the ATP binding domain (N-terminal) should be exposed to the aqueous phase. We have recently observed that Hsp70-mediated liposome aggregation is also modulated by ATP and ADP. This observation is consistent with the assumption that the nucleotide binding site is accessible to the nucleotides in the aqueous solution after the insertion of Hsc70 into the liposome membrane (13Arispe N. Doh M. De Maio A. Biophys. J. 2000; 78 (abstr.): 36Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of fragments containing the N-terminal (ATP binding site) and C-terminal (peptide binding site) of Hsc70 have been resolved by x-ray crystallography (19Flaherty K.M. DeLuca-Flaherty C. McKay D.B. Nature. 1990; 346: 623-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar, 20Zhu X. Zhao X. Burkholder W.F. Gragerov A. Ogata C.M. Gottesman M.E. Hendrickson W.A.

Biol. 1999; 289: 1387-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). This region contains a cluster of β-sheets and a long α-helix. These regions may associate directly with other Hsc70 molecules to create a complex that has the proper configuration to spontaneously insert into the lipid bilayer. The peptide binding domain of Hsc70 is over 50 Å in length, large enough to span a biological membrane. There are several examples of molecules with clusters of β-sheet structures that interact with membranes to form ion channels, such as some members of the annexin family (22Rojas E. Arispe N. Haigler H.T. Burns A.L. Pollard H.B. Bone Miner. 1992; 17: 214-218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 23Arispe N. Rojas E. Genge B.R. Wu L.N.Y. Wuthier R.E. Biophys.

Chem. 1996; 271: 1988-1992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). In addition, hydrophobic patches, which are thought to be likely regions for interaction with membrane lipids, have been observed in the C-terminal of the ATP binding domain (19Flaherty K.M. DeLuca-Flaherty C. McKay D.B. Nature. 1990; 346: 623-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar) and in the N-terminal of the peptide binding site (21Morshauser R.C. Hu W. Wang H. Pang Y. Flynn G.C. Zuiderweg E.R.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 1387-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), which may be involved in the interaction with the lipid bilayer.The preceding observations demonstrate that Hsc70 can stably interact with lipids. The biological significance of this observation remains to be elucidated. A possibility is that ion pathways generated by Hsc70 may create the proper ionic environment necessary for the process of polypeptide translocation across membranes. Echoing this assumption, O'Brien and McKay (25O'Brien M.C. McKay D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2247-2250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) have shown that the ATPase activity of Hsc70 is modulated by potassium ions. In addition, a potassium ion requirement is necessary for the dissociation of denatured proteins from bacterial Hsp70 (26Palleros D.R. Reid K.L. Shi L. Welch W.J. Fink A.L. Nature. 1993; 365: 664-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Given these observations, the fact that Hsc70 can form channels with selectivity for cations opens new and exciting possibilities for the biological role of this chaperone protein. Heat shock proteins (hsps)1 are molecular chaperones that participate in different normal cellular processes, including the folding of newly synthesized proteins and their import into subcellular compartments such as the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, the oligomeric assembly of proteins, and protein degradation (1Lindquist S.

These regions may associate directly with other Hsc70 molecules to create a complex that has the proper configuration to spontaneously insert into the lipid bilayer. The peptide binding domain of Hsc70 is over 50 Å in length, large enough to span a biological membrane. There are several examples of molecules with clusters of β-sheet structures that interact with membranes to form ion channels, such as some members of the annexin family (22Rojas E. Arispe N.

Chem. 1996; 271: 1988-1992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). In addition, hydrophobic patches, which are thought to be likely regions for interaction with membrane lipids, have been observed in the C-terminal of the ATP binding domain (19Flaherty K.M. DeLuca-Flaherty C. McKay D.B. Nature. 1990; 346: 623-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar) and in the N-terminal of the peptide binding site (21Morshauser R.C. Hu W. Wang H. Pang Y. Flynn G.C. Zuiderweg E.R.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 1387-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), which may be involved in the interaction with the lipid bilayer.The preceding observations demonstrate that Hsc70 can stably interact with lipids. The biological significance of this observation remains to be elucidated. A possibility is that ion pathways generated by Hsc70 may create the proper ionic environment necessary for the process of polypeptide translocation across membranes. Echoing this assumption, O'Brien and McKay (25O'Brien M.C. McKay D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2247-2250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) have shown that the ATPase activity of Hsc70 is modulated by potassium ions. In addition, a potassium ion requirement is necessary for the dissociation of denatured proteins from bacterial Hsp70 (26Palleros D.R. Reid K.L. Shi L. Welch W.J. Fink A.L. Nature. 1993; 365: 664-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Given these observations, the fact that Hsc70 can form channels with selectivity for cations opens new and exciting possibilities for the biological role of this chaperone protein. The finding that Hsc70 can form a well defined and stable cationic selective channel in artificial lipid bilayers is intriguing. Although Hsc70 is predominately a cytosolic protein, the presence of Hsp70s in association with or in close proximity to cellular membranes has been previously reported (6Welch W.J. Suhan J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 1198-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 7Kurucz I. Tombor B. Prechl J. Erdo F. Hegedus E. Nagy Z. Vitai M. Koranyi L. Laszlo L. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1999; 4: 139-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 10Multhoff G. Botzler C. Wiesnet M. Muller E. Meier T. Wilmanns W. Int. J. Cancer. 1995; 61: 272-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). The capacity of Hsc70 to form channels is a function that cannot be predicted a priorifrom the structure and chaperone role of this protein. Perhaps the interaction of Hsc70 with lipids is important in the processes of translocation and folding of membrane proteins. The activity of Hsc70 ion pathways was also found to be regulated by the presence of ATP and ADP, which is consistent with the role these nucleotides play in the other functions of Hsc70. Binding of ATP produces a change of conformation in Hsc70 that modulates its interaction with target polypeptides (5Hightower L.E. Sadis S.E. Morimoto R.I. Tissieres A. Georgopoulos C. The Biology of Heat Shock Proteins and Molecular Chaperones. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 179-207Google Scholar). The effect of ATP and ADP on the Hsc70 ion pathway may be similar. A conformational change of Hsc70 may be necessary for the opening of the channel. Previous observations have also suggested a possible interaction between Hsp70s and lipids. Alder et al.(11Alder G.M. Austen B.M. Bashford C.L. Mehlert A. Pasternak C.A. Biosci. Rep. 1990; 10: 509-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) showed that Hsp70s were capable of opening pores into liposomes, producing a leakage of the liposome content. In addition, they observed Hsp70-induced currents in artificial lipid bilayers. In this early work, the Hsp70-induced currents were not characterized. The addition of exogenous Hsp70 to patch-clamped membranes was reported to activate potassium channels (12Negulyaev Y.A. Vedernikova E.A. Kinev A.V. Voronin A.P. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1282: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Recently, we reported that Hsc70 is also capable of inducing liposome aggregation in a nucleotide regulated process (13Arispe N. Doh M. De Maio A. Biophys. J. 2000; 78 (abstr.): 36Google Scholar). All members of the Hsp70 family contain two major structural and functional domains. The N terminus of the molecule binds and hydrolyzes ATP, and the C terminus participates in the interaction with target proteins (peptide binding domain) (2Morimoto R.I. Cancer Cells. 1991; 3: 295-301PubMed Google Scholar). Members of the Hsp70 family self-associate to form oligomers of low order in the absence of peptide targets or denatured proteins, also in an ATP-dependent manner (14Schlossman D.M. Schmid S.L. Brael W.A. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 723-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 15Freiden P.J. Gaut J.R. Hendershot L.M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 16792-16797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The C terminus of Hsc70 has been shown to be essential for self-association (18Benaroudj N. Fouchaq B. Ladjimi M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8744-8751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). It is quite likely that the actual Hsc70 channel may be formed by oligomers of this protein. The characteristic multiconductance nature and the various patterns of channel activity observed after incorporation of Hsc70 into the lipid bilayer may be the result of the incorporation of different order oligomers. However, we cannot discard the possibility that multiconductance is due to conformational changes of Hsc70. These oligomers may be inserted into the lipid bilayer by the C terminus of the molecule. This assumption is based on the observation that channel activity is reversibly regulated by ATP and ADP. Thus, the ATP binding domain (N-terminal) should be exposed to the aqueous phase. We have recently observed that Hsp70-mediated liposome aggregation is also modulated by ATP and ADP. This observation is consistent with the assumption that the nucleotide binding site is accessible to the nucleotides in the aqueous solution after the insertion of Hsc70 into the liposome membrane (13Arispe N. Doh M. De Maio A. Biophys. J. 2000; 78 (abstr.): 36Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W1998174830,"Membrane carboxypeptidase E (CPE) is a sorting receptor for targeting prohormones, such as pro-opiomelanocortin, to the regulated secretory pathway in endocrine cells. Its membrane association is necessary for it to bind a prohormone sorting signal at the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to facilitate targeting. In this study, we examined the lipid interaction of CPE in bovine pituitary secretory granule membranes, which are derived from the TGN. We show that CPE is associated with detergent-resistant lipid domains, or rafts, within secretory granule membranes. Lipid analysis revealed that these rafts are enriched in glycosphingolipids and cholesterol. Pulse-chase and subcellular fractionation experiments in AtT-20 cells show that the association of CPE with membrane rafts occurred only after it reached the Golgi. Cholesterol depletion resulted in dissociation of CPE from secretory granule membranes and decreased the binding of prohormones to membranes. In vivo cholesterol depletion using lovastatin resulted in the lack of sorting of CPE and its cargo to the regulated secretory pathway. We propose that the sorting receptor function of CPE necessitates its interaction with glycosphingolipid-cholesterol rafts at the TGN, thereby anchoring it in position to bind to its prohormone cargo.

Peptide hormones are initially synthesized as larger precursors, or prohormones, and may acquire a number of post-translational modifications during transportation through the ER1 and Golgi stacks. Upon entering the trans-Golgi network (TGN), prohormones are segregated away from constitutively secreted proteins and instead are targeted to the regulated secretory pathway (RSP). It is during the sorting process that prohormones are packaged into budding immature secretory granules. A small subset of constitutive proteins also enters the immature secretory granules and is removed through a process termed constitutive-like secretion (1Kuliawat R. Arvan P. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 521-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The mature secretory granule is the storage compartment of the RSP, from which peptide hormones are released in a Ca2+-dependent manner. The molecular mechanisms that are involved in the sorting of prohormones to the RSP have been intensively examined. One key step in sorting to the RSP may be selective Ca2+-dependent aggregation, as observed with chromogranins A and B (2Chanat E. Huttner W.B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1505-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). However, aggregation in itself is not sufficient to target proteins to the RSP, since sorting can occur in the absence of aggregation (3Quinn D. Orci L. Ravazzola M. Moore H.-P.H. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 987-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and constitutive secretion can occur in the presence of aggregation (4Chanat E. Weiß U. Huttner W.B. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Sorting of prohormones to the RSP may therefore be a more active and selective process, requiring the presence of a specific sorting signal and sorting receptor. Sorting signals have been identified in the form of structural motifs, such as the disulfide-bonded loop of chromogranin B (5Krömer A. Glombik M.M. Huttner W.B. Gerdes H.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1331-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 6Glombik M.M. Krömer A. Salm T. Huttner W.B. Gerdes H.-H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1059-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and the hydrophobic acidic amino acid motif of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) (7Cool D.R. Fenger M. Snell C.R. Loh Y.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8723-8729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear if CGB itself binds to the membrane of the TGN or if it requires interaction with another protein (8Yoo S.H. Lewis M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17041-17046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In contrast, it has been shown that the sorting of POMC, proenkephalin, and proinsulin requires the presence of the membrane form of carboxypeptidase E (CPE) as a sorting receptor (9Cool D.R. Normant E. Shen F.S. Chen H.C. Pannell L. Zhang Y. Loh Y.P. Cell. 1997; 88: 73-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). A number of studies have provided evidence that CPE functions as a sorting receptor for prohormones. The N-terminal end of POMC, which contains the sorting signal, binds specifically to CPE in secretory granule membranes from bovine intermediate pituitary (9Cool D.R. Normant E. Shen F.S. Chen H.C. Pannell L. Zhang Y. Loh Y.P. Cell. 1997; 88: 73-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Antisense-mediated depletion of CPE in Neuro2A cells causes constitutive secretion of prohormones (9Cool D.R. Normant E. Shen F.S. Chen H.C. Pannell L. Zhang Y. Loh Y.P. Cell. 1997; 88: 73-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 10Normant E. Loh Y.P. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2137-2145Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). As well, POMC, proenkephalin, and proinsulin all exhibit similar binding kinetics to CPE, in both secretory granule membranes (11Cool C.R. Loh Y.P. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1998; 139: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and Sf9 cell membranes expressing recombinant mouse CPE (12Zhang C.-F. Snell C.R. Loh Y.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 527-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Finally, the binding site on CPE that interacts with the sorting signal of prohormones resides in a domain distinct from the catalytic domain of soluble CPE (12Zhang C.-F. Snell C.R. Loh Y.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 527-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Therefore, the interaction between the sorting signals of POMC, proenkephalin, and proinsulin and their binding site on CPE is highly specific, indicating that CPE acts as a sorting receptor in the targeting of these prohormones to the RSP. Thus far, protein-protein interactions have been the sole mechanism used to describe the process of regulated sorting from the TGN. However, a role for membrane lipids in this process has not been examined. It has been proposed that cholesterol-glycosphingolipid microdomains, or rafts, exist within the plasma membrane of cells (13Brown D.A. London E. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 164: 103-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar,14Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8157) Google Scholar). The organization of membrane proteins into rafts may be required for a diverse number of cellular functions, including apical sorting (15Keller P. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1357-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 16Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2618) Google Scholar), endocytosis (17Mayor S. Sabharanjak S. Maxfield F.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4626-4638Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), and intracellular signaling (18Field K.A. Holowka D. Baird B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4276-4280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 19Tansey M.G. Baloh R.H. Milbrandt J. Johnson Jr., E.M. Neuron. 2000; 25: 611-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Similarly, lipid rafts could also play a role in sorting to the RSP in endocrine cells. We therefore hypothesized that rafts exist within the membranes of the TGN and secretory granules and that CPE must be anchored to rafts in its function as an RSP sorting receptor. Our previous work has shown that CPE is not extracted from pituitary secretory granule membranes treated with Triton X-100 or with 1m NaCl (11Cool C.R. Loh Y.P. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1998; 139: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), suggesting that CPE may interact with detergent-resistant membranes. Here we show that CPE, a sorting receptor for the regulated secretory pathway, associates with cholesterol-glycolipid rafts in secretory granule membranes and that interaction with rafts is necessary for its function as a sorting receptor.

For cholesterol depletion experiments, methyl-β-cyclodextrin and mevalonate were bought from Sigma, and lovastatin was obtained from Calbiochem. Highly purified secretory granules and microsomes (P4 fraction) were prepared from bovine pituitary neural and intermediate lobes as described previously (20Loh Y.P. Tam W.W.H. Russell J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8238-8245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In order to prepare granule membranes, granules were lysed by six rounds of freeze thawing in Tris-succinate, pH 5.9, and then washed in three changes of 10 mm Tris-EDTA, pH 7.4. Membranes were solubilized in cold 1% Triton X-100 in TNE (50 mm Tris-Cl, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) and incubated on ice for 30 min. For treatment with β-octyl glucoside, membranes were solubilized in 60 mm β-octyl glucoside and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. Following extraction, the particulate fraction was isolated by centrifugation at 22 p.s.i. in a Beckman Airfuge, or at 31,000 rpm in a Beckman SW 50.1 rotor (120,000 × g) for 10 min. Equal aliquots of both soluble and particulate fractions were separated on a 12% Tris-glycine SDS-polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Membrane CPE was detected using a C-terminal antibody (CPE7-8 or CPE7-6) that recognizes the last 4 residues of the molecule at a final dilution of 1:3000 in 1% bovine serum albumin (in phosphate-buffered saline). Detection of immunoreactive CPE was by the SuperSignal Chemiluminescence System (Pierce). Secretory granule membranes were extracted with Triton X-100 at 4 °C as described above. The lysate was resuspended in 0.4 ml of 1.5 msucrose (in TNE), loaded in the bottom of a centrifuge tube, and overlaid with 1.7 ml of 1.2 m sucrose and 1.5 ml of 0.8m sucrose. Following centrifugation at 39,000 rpm in a Beckman SW 50.1 rotor for 15 h, 0.3-ml fractions were collected by bottom puncture. Aliquots of 10 μl were taken from each fraction for density determination. Protein was precipitated in 20% trichloroacetic acid, and the pellet was washed once with acetone before Western blot analysis of membrane CPE. AtT-20 cells were grown in 60-mm dishes to 80% confluency and depleted of methionine by incubation for 30 min in methionine-free DMEM containing 10% dialyzed FBS. Cells were then labeled in the same medium containing 0.1 mCi/ml of [35S]methionine. Cells were labeled for 2 min, after which media were removed and cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. After incubation in chase medium (DMEM containing 10% dialyzed FBS and 10 mm methionine) for the desired chase time, media were removed, and cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were then scraped and resuspended in 1% Triton X-100 in TNE and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. Membrane and soluble fractions were isolated by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 20 min. For immunoprecipitation of membrane CPE, membrane and soluble components were incubated with a C-terminal antibody to CPE (CPE7-6) in a final dilution of 1:100 overnight at 4 °C. To each tube was added 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads, and tubes were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Samples were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm on a benchtop microcentrifuge for 30 s, and the pellet was washed four times in wash buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 300 mmNaCl, 5 mm EDTA). The pellet was resuspended in loading buffer, and beads were removed by boiling and centrifugation before loading on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Radiolabeled CPE was detected by fluorography, and bands on autoradiograms were quantified by scanning denistometry. Sulfated POMC was used as a marker for the labeling of regulated secretory proteins in the TGN and movement into immature secretory granules (ISGs) in AtT-20 cells (21Fernandez C.J. Haugwitz M. Eaton B. Moore H.-P.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2171-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Velocity sucrose density centrifugation was used to isolate and separate TGN and ISGs using the methods of Chanat et al. (22Chanat E. Dittie A.S. Tooze S.A. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 88: 285-324PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown in 10-cm dishes and preincubated for 30 min in sulfate-labeling medium (110 mm NaCl, 5.4 mmKCl, 0.9 mm Na2HPO4, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 g/liter glucose, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2). The cells were labeled with 2.5 mCi/ml [35S]sulfate (ICN) for 4.5 min for TGN localization and chased for 15 min for ISG localization. Cells were washed and scraped in ice-cold homogenization buffer (1 mm EDTA, 1 mm magnesium acetate, 1.6 mm Na2SO4, 250 mmsucrose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.15). Cell pellets were homogenized using an EMBL cell cracker. The resulting postnuclear supernatant was loaded onto a linear 0.3–1.2 m sucrose gradient and centrifuged for 15 min at 110,000 × g in a Beckman SW 28.1 rotor. Fractions of 1 ml were collected; half of each fraction was used for polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of sulfated POMC. Fractions 4–7 (TGN) and fractions 11–14 (ISGs) were pooled, diluted with 1 volume of homogenization buffer, and centrifuged at 110,000 × g for 15 min to isolate TGN or at 130,000 × g for 30 min to isolate ISGs. Both TGN and ISGs were lysed by three rounds of freeze-thawing and extracted with 1% Triton X-100 for 30 min on ice. Membrane and soluble fractions were analyzed for CPE immunoreactivity by Western blot. Isolation of ER was carried out using the method of Watanabe et al. (23Watanabe R. Kinoshita T. Masaki R. Yamamoto A. Takeda J. Inoue N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26868-26875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Briefly, AtT-20 cells were grown to confluency in 10-cm dishes. After trypsinization, cell pellets were homogenized in an EMBL cell cracker, and the resulting postnuclear supernatant was loaded on a sucrose density gradient consisting of 3.6 ml of 38% sucrose, 1.8 ml of 30% sucrose, and 1.8 ml of 20% sucrose. Samples were centrifuged at 100,000 × g in a Beckman Ti70.1 rotor for 3 h, and eight 1-ml fractions were collected. Half of each fraction was used for Western blot analysis of the ER marker calnexin. Fractions enriched in calnexin immunoreactivity (fractions 2–6) were pooled, diluted with 1 volume of homogenization buffer, and extracted with 1% Triton X-100 on ice for 30 min. Membrane and soluble fractions were analyzed for CPE immunoreactivity by Western blot. Secretory granule membranes (both unextracted and detergent-extracted) from pituitary neural lobe were weighed and homogenized in 1:1 chloroform/methanol while still frozen. Neutral and acidic lipid fractions were isolated by elution from a Sephadex A25 column (24Macala L.J., Yu, R.K. Ando S. J. Lipid Res. 1983; 24: 1243-1250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and separation and detection of phospholipids were carried out according to the quantitative TLC methods of Macalaet al. (24Macala L.J., Yu, R.K. Ando S. J. Lipid Res. 1983; 24: 1243-1250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Neutral glycolipids and gangliosides were purified according to Ariga et al. (25Ariga T. Macala L.J. Saito M. Margolis R.K. Greene L.A. Margolis R.U. Yu R.K. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and Brown and Rose (16Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2618) Google Scholar). Neutral glycolipids were separated on TLC using chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/formic acid/water (42:18:7.2:2.4:1.2) and detected with α-naphthol. Gangliosides were separated by TLC using chloroform/methanol/0.25% KCl (50:45:10) and visualized with α-naphthol. Densitometric scanning and quantification of all lipids were carried out using NIH-Image version 1.57 and ImageQuant version 1.2 (Molecular Dynamics) software, respectively. Intermediate or neural lobe membranes were prepared as described above. 100 μg of membrane protein was added to microcentrifuge tubes containing 250 μl of 0, 10, 20, 40, 80, or 100 mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin and mixed well. Tubes were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min with shaking. Centrifugation, trichloroacetic acid precipitation, and Western blotting for membrane CPE were carried out as described above. Neural lobe membranes were extracted with 0, 20, or 80 mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin as described above. Binding of 125I-labeled N-POMC or 125I-labeled proinsulin to extracted neural lobe membranes was carried out as described previously (9Cool D.R. Normant E. Shen F.S. Chen H.C. Pannell L. Zhang Y. Loh Y.P. Cell. 1997; 88: 73-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 11Cool C.R. Loh Y.P. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1998; 139: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Values obtained for specific binding varied from 2732 ± 94 cpm (POMC) and 2365 ± 138 cpm (proinsulin) in unextracted membranes to 655 ± 101 cpm (POMC) and 1173 ± 253 cpm (proinsulin) in membranes extracted with 80 mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin. All values were plotted as percentage of the total from three experiments. For immunocytochemical studies, AtT-20 cells were grown in two-well plastic chamber slides (Lab-Tek) until approximately 60% confluent. To deplete exogenous cholesterol sources and inhibit intracellular cholesterol synthesis, cells were treated with 10 μm lovastatin plus 250 μm mevalonate in 10% LPDS for 39 h. For recovery experiments, cells were subsequently incubated in DMEM plus 10% FBS for 12 h. After all treatments, cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed, and immunostained for CPE using antiserum 7-2 and a TSA-Direct kit (NEN Life Science Products) or for POMC using antibody DP4 as described previously (7Cool D.R. Fenger M. Snell C.R. Loh Y.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8723-8729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). To show cellular morphology, cells were also stained with fluorescein-conjugated wheat germ agglutinin. To stain for membrane cholesterol, cells were incubated with 0.05% filipin as described previously (26Neufeld E.B. Cooney A.M. Pitha J. Dawidowicz E.A. Dwyer N.K. Pentchev P.G. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21604-21613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), and fluorescence was detected at 350–410 nm. Immunofluorescent cells were viewed using a Bio-Rad MRC-1000 confocal microscope, and images were captured and processed using LaserSharp software. For secretion studies, cells were grown in 6-cm plates and treated as above. Following cholesterol depletion, the following pulse-chase protocol was employed. Cells were labeled as described above for 15 min, immediately placed on ice, and washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were chased for three 1-h time periods. During the last chase period, one parallel plate of cells was incubated in DMEM containing 50 mm KCl to stimulate release. For cholesterol-depleted cells, all labeling and chase media contained 10% LPDS in place of FBS, 10 μm lovastatin, and 250 μm mevalonate. Immunoprecipitation was carried out as described above on media and cell extracts, using antibody 7-6 for membrane CPE and antibody DP4 for POMC and its derived peptides. Previous work from our laboratory indicated that membrane CPE could not be solubilized by treatment of pituitary secretory granule membranes (SGMs) with Triton X-100 at 22 °C (11Cool C.R. Loh Y.P. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1998; 139: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Since insolubility in Triton X-100 at 4 °C is one of the criteria by which raft proteins are identified (27Harder T. Simons K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar), we pursued the hypothesis that CPE is associated with lipid rafts in SGMs. Treatment of SGMs prepared from bovine pituitary intermediate lobes with 1% Triton X-100 for 30 min at 4 °C did not solubilize C-terminal immunoreactive CPE (Fig.1 A). As a positive control, blots were stripped and probed with antibodies to chromogranin A (CGA), a regulated secretory protein that is removed from SGMs by cold Triton X-100 (Fig. 1 A). These extractions were repeated in SGMs derived from bovine pituitary neural lobe as well as from bovine chromaffin granules with similar results. Quantification of CPE- and CGA-immunoreactive bands indicated that >60% of the membrane CPE stayed in the pellet after extraction with Triton X-100, while >95% of granule CGA was solubilized. SGMs were also treated with β-octyl glucoside, since this detergent solubilizes raft proteins (16Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2618) Google Scholar). Approximately 70% of total immunoreactive CPE was extracted from SGMs with 60 mm octyl glucoside. To further determine whether CPE is associated with detergent-insoluble lipids, the density of the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction was examined by centrifugation on sucrose density gradients. As seen in Fig.1 B, a large pool of CPE floated to a lower density fraction (1.12–1.08 g/cm3), and a smaller pool floated to the lightest fractions (1.05–1.03 g/cm3). To this result we compared the density of solubilized CPE by extracting SGMs with octyl glucoside instead of Triton X-100 prior to density gradient centrifugation. Most of the CPE was recovered in the highest density fraction following this treatment (Fig. 1 B), as are other raft proteins following solubilization (16Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2618) Google Scholar). Pulse-chase experiments were performed in AtT-20 cells in order to determine the kinetics with which CPE acquires Triton X-100 insolubility in vivo. After a 2-min pulse with [35S]methionine, cells were chased for 5, 20, 60, and 180 min; these chase times approximate passage into the ER, Golgi, immature secretory granule, and mature secretory granule, respectively. Cells were then extracted with 1% Triton X-100 in TNE, and CPE was immunoprecipitated from both particulate and soluble fractions. Analysis by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis shows that CPE was almost entirely detergent-soluble in the first 5 min of chase (Fig.2). However, CPE began to acquire resistance to Triton X-100 extraction at 20 min of chase, and by 60 min, all of the radiolabeled CPE was resistant to detergent extraction (Fig. 2). In order to precisely determine the compartment in which CPE becomes detergent-resistant, subcellular fractionation of AtT-20 cells was used to isolate vesicle preparations enriched in ER, TGN, or ISGs. The ER resident protein calnexin was used as an ER marker, and ER membranes were prepared from fractions enriched in calnexin immunoreactivity (Fig. 3 A). Western blot analysis of soluble and membrane fractions showed that CPE was detergent-soluble in fractions enriched in calnexin (Fig.3 A). Membranes of the TGN and ISGs were prepared from fractions isolated by velocity density gradient centrifugation. Since CPE was not sulfated appreciably (data not shown), [35SO4]POMC was used as a marker protein (21Fernandez C.J. Haugwitz M. Eaton B. Moore H.-P.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2171-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). After a 5-min pulse, [35SO4]POMC was present in fractions 4–6, representing its localization in the TGN; after a 15-min chase, POMC had moved into fractions 10–14, which contain ISGs (Fig. 3 B). A significant portion of CPE (>50%) was Triton X-100-insoluble in both TGN and ISG membranes. These results indicate that CPE associates with detergent-insoluble membranes in TGN and immature secretory granules.Figure 3CPE acquires detergent resistance in the TGN. A, a postnuclear supernatant was prepared and centrifuged through a sucrose step gradient to isolate ER membranes, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fractions enriched in calnexin (left panel, fractions 3–6) were pooled, and ER membranes were isolated and extracted with 1% Triton X-100 in TNE, and membrane and soluble fractions were analyzed for CPE immunoreactivity. B, velocity density gradient centrifugation was used to separate TGN and ISGs. After a 5-min pulse with [35S]SO4(left upper panel), POMC is sulfated in the TGN and moves into ISGs following a 15-min chase (left lower panel). Fractions enriched in sulfated POMC were pooled, TGN and ISG membranes were isolated and extracted with 1% Triton X-100 in TNE, and membrane and soluble fractions were analyzed for CPE immunoreactivity (right panels).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Phospholipid, glycolipid and cholesterol content of Triton X-100-extracted SGMs was analyzed by HPTLC (16Brown D.A.

Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Lipids from three separate pituitary neural lobe SGM preparations were quantified by densitometric scanning of HPTLC plates and comparison with standards, and the results are shown in TableI. Phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, and sphingomyelin are the major phospholipids in SGMs. These results are comparable with those reported previously for pituitary and chromaffin SGMs (28Vilhardt H. Hflmer G. Acta Endocrinol. 1972; 71: 638-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 29Buckland R.M. Radda G.A. Shennan C.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 513: 321-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Cholesterol comprised over half of the total lipid content of SGMs (Table I). Extraction of SGMs with Triton X-100 at 4 °C reduced total phospholipid and cholesterol content; 70–90% of phospholipids and 65% of cholesterol were removed by detergent treatment (Table I). On a molar basis, cholesterol was enriched by 20% in detergent-insoluble fractions. Qualitative analysis of phospholipids and cholesterol from pituitary intermediate lobe SGMs yielded similar results (data not shown).Table ILipid composition of bovine pituitary neural lobe secretory granule membranes and Triton X-100-insoluble membranesSecretory granule membranesTriton X-100-insoluble membranesTissueTotal lipidTissueTotal lipidEnrichmentnmol/mgmol %nmol/mgmol %-foldPhospholipids PC7 ± 16.3 ± 0.20.2 ± 0.10.7 ± 0.1 PE19 ± 218 ± 0.43 ± 18.6 ± 2 PS4 ± 0.33.7 ± 0.11 ± 0.13.4 ± 0.5 PI1 ± 0.021 ± 0.10.2 ± 0.10.6 ± 1.0 SM8 ± 27.6 ± 21 ± 0.54.4 ± 2Cholesterol67 ± 565 ± 224 ± 376 ± 21.2 ± 0.1Neutral glycolipid GB41 ± 0.11.2 ± 0.11 ± 0.13.1 ± 0.32.6 ± 0.2Gangliosides GD1a0.7 ± 0.10.7 ± 0.10.5 ± 0.011.6 ± 0.32.4 ± 0.3 GM10.2 ± 0.30.2 ± 0.020.2 ± 0.030.5 ± 0.032.5 ± 0.1 GM30.1 ± 0.010.1 ± 0.030.1 ± 0.010.2 ± 0.012.6 ± 0.2Lipids were extracted fr"

Prior studies have shown that Sp1, Sp3, and the histone acetylase co-activator p300 are components of the complexes binding to these sites. Although Sp1 and Sp3 collaborate with p300, a direct interaction between Sp1 and p300 does not occur. This study sought to determine whether ZBP-89 rather than Sp1 is the direct target of p300 during butyrate induction of p21 waf1 . ZBP-89 (BFCOL1, BERF-1, ZNF 148) is a Krüppel-type zinc finger transcription factor that binds to GC-rich elements and represses or activates known target genes. Adenoviral-mediated expression of ZBP-89 in HT-29 cells revealed that ZBP-89 potentiates butyrate induction of endogenous p21 waf1 gene expression. Further, cotransfection of a ZBP-89 expression vector with a 2.3-kilobase p21 waf1 reporter recapitulated the potentiation by butyrate. DNase I footprinting analysis of the human p21 waf1 promoter with recombinant ZBP-89 identified a binding site at −245 to −215. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays confirmed that both recombinant and endogenous ZBP-89 and Sp1 bind to this element. The potentiation was abolished in the presence of adenoviral protein E1A. Deletion of the N-terminal domain of ZBP-89 abolished the potentiation mediated by butyrate treatment. This same deletion mutant abolished the ZBP-89 interaction with p300. Cotransfection of p300 with ZBP-89 stimulated the p21 waf1 promoter in the absence of butyrate. p300 co-precipitated with ZBP-89 but not with Sp1, whereas ZBP-89 co-precipitated with Sp1. Together, these findings demonstrate that ZBP-89 also plays a critical role in butyrate activation of the p21 waf1 promoter and reveals preferential cooperation of this four-zinc finger transcription factor with p300.

Many of the studies reporting p53-independent regulation of p21 waf1 transcription demonstrate a requirement for GC-rich sites located within the first 100 bp1 of its promoter (6Owen G.I. Richer J.K.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6252-6261Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Several studies have shown that Sp1 or Sp3 mediate activation of the p21 waf1 promoter by these extracellular regulators such as nerve growth factor and transforming growth factor-β; however, these same signals do not stimulate Sp1 binding or gene expression (10Billon N. Carlisi D. Datto M.B. van Grunsven L.A. Watt A. Wang X.F. Rudkin B.B. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2872-2882Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The transcriptional co-activator p300 mediates growth arrest by catalyzing histone acetylation and subsequent chromatin rearrangements through its endogenous acetyltransferase enzyme activity (14Giordano A. Avantaggiati M.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 181: 218-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results raised the possibility that Sp1 transcriptional activity may be regulated by its association with a co-activator. As a result, the p300 co-activator was shown to co-precipitate in complexes with Sp1 (10Billon N. Carlisi D. Datto M.B. van Grunsven L.A. Watt A. Wang X.F. Rudkin B.B. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2872-2882Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Moreover, activation of the p21 waf1 promoter by butyrate and nerve growth factor has been shown to require a functional collaboration between Sp1 and p300 (10Billon N. Carlisi D. Datto M.B. van Grunsven L.A. Watt A. Wang X.F. Rudkin B.B. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2872-2882Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 15Xiao H. Hasegawa T. Isobe K. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 1371-1376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Thus, although p300 and Sp1 are components of the complex activating p21 waf1 , the interaction is indirect raising the possibility that other factors are likely to participate in this transcriptional regulatory complex. Presumably, at least one or more of these other factors are capable of direct contact with p300. ZBP-89 (BFCOL1, BERF1, ZNF 148) is a widely expressed four-zinc finger transcription factor that binds to GC-rich DNA elements in a variety of promoters involved in growth regulation, e.g. promoters for gastrin, T-cell α- and β- receptors, ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), enolase, type I procollagen, cyclin-dependent inhibitor p21 waf1 , vimentin, and stromelysin (16Merchant J.L.

In many instances, ZBP-89 appears to repress promoter activity by opposing the effect of Sp1, which also binds to the same or overlapping DNA element. Thus, competitive binding to the shared promoter elements may mediate transcriptional regulation by Sp1 and ZBP-89 (16Merchant J.L. Iyer G.R. Taylor B.R. Kitchen J.R. Mortensen E.R. Wang Z.

Merchant J.L. Zehner Z.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12879-12888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Studies by Hasegawa et al. (24Hasegawa T. Xiao H. Isobe K.-i. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 256: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) showed binding of ZBP-89 to a proximal Sp1 element from the mouse p21 waf1 promoter. We hypothesized that ZBP-89 may be present in the p300/Sp1 activation complex and participate in the activation of p21 waf1 transcription. p21 waf1 is required for butyrate-mediated growth inhibition in HT-29 colorectal adenocarcinoma cells (25Archer S.Y. Meng S. Shei A. Hodin R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6791-6796Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 26Siavoshian S. Segain J.P. Kornprobst M. Bonnet C. Cherbut C. Galmiche J.P. Blottiere H.M. Gut. 2000; 46: 507-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Thus the goals of this study were to examine the role of ZBP-89 in p21 waf1 activation by butyrate. The results demonstrate that both ZBP-89 and Sp1 recognize the same p21 waf1 regulatory sequences and that ZBP-89-dependent activation depends upon elevated histone acetyltransferase activity. We also found that Sp1, as reported (15Xiao H. Hasegawa T. Isobe K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1371-1376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), does not directly bind p300. Instead, we find that p300 cooperates directly with ZBP-89. The human p21 waf1 reporter construct p21 waf1 /2300-Luc, which contains the human p21 waf1 promoter from −2326 to +16 ligated upstream of the luciferase cDNA, was a kind gift from Dr. W. El-Deiry (University of Pennsylvania). The pRcRSV/E1A-12S, pRcRSV/E1A-RG2, and pcDNA3/p300 expression vector, were gifts from Dr. Roland Kwok (University of Michigan). pBL9 E1A 12S ΔCR2 is a gift from Dr. Tony Kouzarides (Wellcome/CRC Institute, Cambridge University). An ODC reporter construct was prepared by inserting the 2.3-kb KpnI-HindIII fragment from the p2.3SK6.1 plasmid (a gift from M. A. Flanagan, Merrill Dow) into pGL2 Basic (Promega, Madison, WI). The resulting ODC promoter construct pODC2300-Luc contained ∼1.5 kb of 5′ flanking sequence and 0.8 kb of downstream sequences including the first exon. The rat ZBP-89 construct subcloned into pBKCMV (pCMV/rZBP-89) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) has been previously reported (16Merchant J.L. Iyer G.R. Taylor B.R. Kitchen J.R. Mortensen E.R. Wang Z. Flintoft R.J. Michel J. Bassel-Duby R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6644-6653Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). A Tet-on inducible ZBP-89 expression vector (pBI-G/rZBP-89) was prepared by subcloning the full-length rat ZBP-89 cDNA as a blunt PCR fragment into the filled-in SalI site of the pBI-G vector (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). Deletions of pCMV/rZBP-89 expression vectors were prepared using PCR-generated fragments containing 5′NheI and 3′NotI sites followed by cohesive ligation into the pBKCMV vector. The C-terminal deletion (ΔC-ter) containing residues 1 to 521 of rZBP-89 in pBKCMV (Stratagene) has been previously reported (16Merchant J.L. Iyer G.R. Taylor B.R. Kitchen J.R. Mortensen E.R. Wang Z. Flintoft R.J. Michel J. Bassel-Duby R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6644-6653Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Deletion of the acidic domain (Δ2–112); basic domain 2 and C terminus (Δ301–794); the acidic domain and basic domain 1 (Δ2–153); the acidic domain and basic domain 2 (Δ2–112 and Δ 301–794) and deletion of both amino and C-terminal domains leaving the zinc finger domain (Δ2–153 and Δ301–794) were all generated by PCR amplification and subsequent subcloning. Deletion of BD1 (Δ142–146 residues KKKKR) was accomplished using the QuickChange Mutation Kit (Stratagene) and the following primers: 5′-CAAGTGAGAGAGCCAGTAGACTTACTCGAGAAACAACGCTCTCCTGCAAAAATC and 5′-GATTTTTGCAGGAGAGCGTTGTTTCTCGAGTAAGTCTACTGGCTCTCTCACTTG-3′. The deletion was confirmed by DNA sequencing. A consensus Kozak sequence (ACCATG) and two tandem repeats of the Myc epitope tag were added to the N terminus. The Myc tag sequence used was: 5′-GAACAAAAACTCATCTCAGAAGAGGATCTGGAACAAAAACTCATCTCAGAAGAGGATCTG-3′. The mutations were confirmed by sequencing, and their expression was confirmed by immunoblot using either rabbit polyclonal ZBP-89 antibody or monoclonal anti-c-Myc antibody (9E10 Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA). The N-terminal Myc-tagged and C-terminal FLAG-tagged full-length rat ZBP-89 expression vector was prepared using the following primers: 5′-TATACCATGGAACAAAAACTCATCTCAGAAGAGGATCTGGAACAAAAACTCATCTCAGAAGAGGATCTGAACATTGACGACAAACTGG-3′ as the forward primer and 5′-ATACTCGAGTCACTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCCTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCGCCAAAAGTCTGGCCAG -3′ as the reverse primer. This Myc-ZBP-89-FLAG PCR fragment was blunt end-ligated into the EcoRV and NotI sites of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The orientation was verified by restriction analysis, and the expression was confirmed by anti- FLAG antibody. The resulting plasmid was labeled as pCMV/Myc-ZBP-89-FLAG. To construct a ZBP-89 expressing recombinant adenovirus, the 3.5-kb DNA fragment that contains the ZBP-89 cDNA, CMV promoter, and bovine growth hormone poly(A) signal sequence was excised from pCMV/Myc-ZBP-89-FLAG with NruI and PvuII and then blunt end-ligated into the EcoRV site of the shuttle plasmid pAdMCSloxP (obtained from the University of Michigan Cancer Center Vector Core) (27Aoki K. Barker C. Danthinne X. Imperiale M.J. Nabel G.J. Mol. Med. 1999; 5: 224-231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant replication-deficient adenovirus was produced by the Vector Core using the method of Aoki et al. (27Aoki K. Barker C. Danthinne X. Imperiale M.J. Nabel G.J. Mol. Med. 1999; 5: 224-231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the ZBP-89 adenoviral shuttle plasmid was recombined with the adenovirus type 5 cosmid, and then transfected into 293T cells. The resultant recombinant adenoviral particles were harvested from the cells and called Ad5-ZBP-89. The Ad5-ZBP-89 viral particles were purified by CsCl centrifugation and titered. The HT-29 human colorectal adenocarcinoma (HTB-38) and HeLa human cervix adenocarcinoma cell lines (CCL-2) were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C. The 293/Tet-on cells were purchased from CLONTECH. Sodium butyrate and trichostatin A (TSA) were purchased from Sigma and used at final concentrations of 5 mm and 0.3 μm, respectively. The cells were plated in six-well plates and transiently transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The p21 waf1 reporter plasmid p21 waf1 /2300-Luc and ODC reporter plasmid pODC2300-Luc were cotransfected with the pCMV/rZBP-89 expression vector (16Merchant J.L. Iyer G.R. Taylor B.R. Kitchen J.R. Mortensen E.R. Wang Z. Flintoft R.J. Michel J. Bassel-Duby R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6644-6653Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). 48 h after transfection, the cells were harvested for luciferase, β-galactosidase, and protein assays. At least three transfections in triplicate were performed with each promoter construct. In experiments using butyrate or TSA, the luciferase activity was normalized to cell protein because these treatments stimulated the CMV promoter expressing β-galactosidase. However, in the absence of butyrate or TSA treatment, β-galactosidase was used to normalize transfections, and no significant differences in plasmid transfection efficiency were detected. Induction of the Tet-on promoter was accomplished with 2 μg/ml doxycycline. HT-29 cells were cultured in McCoy's 5A medium, grown to 50% confluence, and then infected with the recombinant adenoviral particles (Ad5 vector or Ad5-ZBP-89) in F12 serum-free medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 5 × 107 viral particles/5 × 106cells/100-mm plate (equivalent to 10 multiplicities of infection) for 6 h. The Ad5 vector, which contains the CMV promoter alone and the poly(A) sequence, was used as a control at the same multiplicity of infection. After infection, the viral particles were washed off, and fresh medium containing serum was added. 36 h later, the cells were treated with or without 5 mm sodium butyrate for another 12 h before they were processed for immunoblot analysis. 50 μg of whole cell extracts were separated on a 4–12% NuPAGE Bis-Tris gradient gel (Novex) and then transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membrane for immunoblot analysis with designated antibodies. Enhanced chemiluminescence was used to detect the antigen-antibody complexes. The anti-FLAG M1 monoclonal antibody was purchased from Sigma, and the anti-actin (C-2) and anti-p21 waf1 (F-5) monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Riboprobes were generated from antisense templates for human ZBP-89 and human cyclophilin. The human ZBP-89 antisense template was constructed using the human ZBP-89 cDNA fragment (28Law D.J. Tarle S.A. Merchant J.L. Mamm. Genome. 1998; 9: 165-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), from +382 to +639 amplified with 5′-GATGAGAGACAAAAAACAAATCAGAGAGCCAGTAGAC-3′ as the forward primer and 5′-GGTACTTCTGTATGAAACGCATGTACAATTGACTAC-3′ as the reverse primer. The PCR product generated was inserted into the pCR2.1 vector (InVitrogen) and sequenced to confirm the orientation. The template was linearized with AccI and used to transcribe a 290-nucleotide ZBP-89 antisense riboprobe that protected a 257-nucleotide fragment. The human pTRI-cyclophilin template (Ambion) generated a 165-nucleotide probe and a 103-nucleotide protected fragment. All riboprobes were prepared using MAXIscript In Vitro Transcription Kit (Ambion). Total RNA was isolated from butyrate-treated HT-29 cells using TRIZOL reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) and then mRNA extracted using poly(A)Ttract mRNA Isolation System (Promega). Total RNA was hybridized for 16 h with riboprobes at 45 °C in hybridization buffer (1 mm EDTA, 300 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.4, 100 mm sodium citrate, pH 6.4, 80% deionized formamide). After hybridization, the samples were digested at 37 °C for 30 min in an RNase A/T1 mixture containing 60 units/ml RNase A, 250 units RNase T1 (Ambion) in digestion buffer (300 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mmEDTA). The protected fragment was precipitated in isopropanol, dissolved in loading buffer (95% formamide, 0.025% xylene cyanol, 0.025% bromphenol blue, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.025% SDS), and then resolved on a 6% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea gel. Protected fragments were quantified on a PhosphorImager and normalized to cyclophilin mRNA levels. Coprecipitation of ZBP-89 with p300, CBP, E1A, or Sp1 antibody was performed in 293T cells stably transfected with the pTet-on repressor (CLONTECH) and then transiently transfected with pBI-G/rZBP-89 using FuGENE6. The cells were treated with or without 2 μg/ml doxycycline to induce ZBP-89 production. The 293T cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mmdithiothreitol in phosphate-buffered saline), and the protein concentration was determined. Whole cell extracts were precleared with rabbit preimmune serum and protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz) at 4 °C for 30 min. The supernatant was incubated with the primary antibody (5–10 μg) for 1 h at 4 °C followed by the addition of 20 μl of Protein A/G-Agarose for another 16 h. The pellets were collected and washed with RIPA buffer three times. The proteins were separated on a 4–12% NuPAGE Bis-Tris gel (Novex) and then transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membrane for immunoblot analysis with designated antibodies. Enhanced chemiluminescence was used to detect the antigen-antibody complex. E1A, p300, CBP, and Sp1 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Recombinant ZBP-89 protein was prepared as described previously (16Merchant J.L. Iyer G.R. Taylor B.R. Kitchen J.R. Mortensen E.R. Wang Z. Flintoft R.J. Michel J. Bassel-Duby R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6644-6653Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (29Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). To footprint ZBP-89-binding sites from −556 to +6, the 560-bp fragment was PCR amplified from p21 waf1 /2300-Luc with forward primer 5′-TTCTGGGAGAGGTGACCTAGT-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CTTCGGCAGCTGCTCACACC-3′. The fragment was end labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase then digested with BstEII to make the labeled antisense strand. To footprint the proximal p21 waf1 promoter elements, p21 waf1 /300-Luc corresponding to −291 to +16 was digested with XbaI, end labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase at +16, and digested with HindIII. The resulting probe was used to footprint the antisense strand. To footprint the sense strand, the same DNA fragment was restricted with SacI and HindIII, end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase, and then digested with XbaI. Footprinting assays were performed with recombinant ZBP-89 prepared as described above. Recombinant ZBP-89 was incubated first with probe on ice for 20 min in the binding buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 6.25 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 5% polyvinyl alcohol, 2 μg/ml poly(dI-dC). DNase I digestion was then carried out for 1 min, and phenol/chloroform was extracted prior to resolving on 6% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea gel. The Maxim-Gilbert G+A ladder was prepared using the probe DNA fragments (30Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates, New York1991: 7.5.1-7.5.9Google Scholar). HT-29 nuclear extract was prepared by the Dignam method without dialysis (31Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9132) Google Scholar). A double-stranded oligonucleotide probe corresponding to the p21 waf1 promoter −245 to −215 (5′-GAGGGACTGGGGGAGGAGGGAAGTGCCCTC-3′) was end labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase. The probe was purified using Quick Spin G-25 columns (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Recombinant ZBP-89, affinity-purified Sp1 (Promega), or nuclear extract was incubated with radiolabeled probe (30,000 cpm/0.2–1 ng) in a final volume of 20 μl containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mmZnCl2, 120 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 μg poly(dI-dC), 1 μg of bovine serum albumin, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol at room temperature for 15 min before resolving on a 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 45 mm Tris base, 45 mm boric acid, and 1 mm EDTA. The EMSAs were resolved at 200 V for 2–6 h at 4 °C. To perform supershift EMSAs, the protein was incubated first with each antibody for 30 min on ice followed by the addition of probe and incubation for 15 min at room temperature. Antibodies to Sp1 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Rabbit ZBP-89 antiserum was prepared as described previously (32Taniuchi T. Mortensen E.R. Ferguson A. Greenson J. Merchant J.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and the IgG fraction was prepared using protein A-agarose (Santa Cruz). Quantitation of the changes in ZBP-89 and Sp1 binding to the p21 waf1 promoter element was achieved by DNA affinity precipitation assays (DAPA) according to the method of Billon et al. (10Billon N. Carlisi D. Datto M.B. van Grunsven L.A. Watt A. Wang X.F. Rudkin B.B. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2872-2882Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Briefly, oligonucleotides biotinylated at the 5′-termini and corresponding to the sense −242 to −212 (5′-GGACTGGGGGAGGAGGGAAGTGCCCTCCCT), and antisense strands of the p21 waf1 element were annealed. The DAPA was performed by incubating 2 μg of biotinylated DNA probe with 300 μg of HT-29 whole cell extracts in binding buffer containing 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 50 mm KCl, 0.2 mmEDTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 20 μmZnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.25% Triton X-100. The mixture was incubated on ice for 30 min prior to adding 100 μl of streptavidin-agarose (Novagen). 2 h later, the agarose beads were collected and rinsed with binding buffer three times. Protein was eluted from the DNA probe by adding Laemmli loading buffer and heating to 90 °C for 5 min. The eluted protein was resolved on a SDS 4–12% polyacrylamide gel (Novex) transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membrane followed by immunoblot analysis for ZBP-89 or Sp1 protein levels. To analyze changes in ZBP-89 and Sp1 protein after butyrate treatment over 1 h, immunoblot analysis was performed on the same extracts used for the DAPA. Whole cell or nuclear extracts were prepared from HT-29 cells, separated on a 4–12% NuPAGE Bis-Tris gel (Novex), and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. The membrane was blocked for 1 h in 0.5× UniBlock (Analytical Genetic Testing Center) at room temperature. ZBP-89 and Sp1 antibodies were used to detect the respective proteins. Butyrate stimulates expression of the cyclin-dependent inhibitor, p21 waf1 , within the first 24 h of treatment (25Archer S.Y. Meng S. Shei A. Hodin R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6791-6796Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 26Siavoshian S. Segain J.P. Kornprobst M. Bonnet C. Cherbut C. Galmiche J.P. Blottiere H.M. Gut. 2000; 46: 507-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). To examine whether butyrate stimulates ZBP-89 gene expression, HT-29 cells were treated with 5 mm butyrate over 5 days (Fig.1). The results show that ZBP-89 mRNA increased within 24 h but was maximal (10-fold) after 5 days of treatment. This time course correlated with the expected morphologic and biochemical changes previously described for HT-29 cells (33Barnard J.A. Warwick G. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 495-501PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore butyrate activates both p21 waf1 and ZBP-89 gene expression. A potential mechanism of ZBP-89 growth repression may be due to direct binding to the p21 waf1 promoter. To determine whether ZBP-89 stimulates endogenous p21 waf1 gene expression, HT-29 cells were infected with adenoviral particles expressing ZBP-89 (Fig.2 A). Anti-FLAG antibody was used to distinguish transfected ZBP-89 expression from endogenous ZBP-89 protein. The same membrane was reprobed with antibodies to ZBP-89, p21 waf1 and actin. There was little effect of ZBP-89 on the endogenous level of p21 waf1 protein in the absence of butyrate. However, in the presence of butyrate, there was a 3-fold enhancement of elevated p21 waf1 protein levels in the presence of elevated ZBP-89 protein expression. Cotransfection of the p21 waf1 promoter with a ZBP-89 expression vector slightly repressed basal promoter activity (Fig. 2 B). However, in the presence of sodium butyrate, ZBP-89 potentiated the induction of p21"

Recently, the ATP-binding cassette transporter 1 (ABC1) was identified as a key mediator of cholesterol efflux to apolipoproteins and HDL. The goal of the present study was to determine a possible interaction between the SR-BI and ABC1 cholesterol efflux pathways in macrophages. Free cholesterol efflux to HDL was increased (∼2.2-fold) in SR-BI transfected RAW macrophages in association with increased SR-BI protein levels. Treatment of macrophages with 8-bromo-cAMP (cAMP) resulted in a 4.1-fold increase in ABC1 mRNA level and also increased cholesterol efflux to HDL (2.2-fold) and apoA-I (5.5-fold). However, in SR-BI transfected RAW cells, cAMP treatment produced a much smaller increment in cholesterol efflux to HDL (1.1-fold) or apoA-I (3.3-fold) compared with control cells. In macrophages loaded with cholesterol by acetyl-LDL treatment, SR-BI overexpression did not increase cholesterol efflux to HDL but did inhibit cAMP-mediated cholesterol efflux to apoA-I or HDL. SR-BI neutralizing antibody led to a dose- and time-dependent increase of cAMP-mediated cholesterol efflux in both SR-BI transfected and control cells, indicating that SR-BI inhibits ABC1-mediated cholesterol efflux even at low SR-BI expression level. Transfection of a murine ABC1 cDNA into 293 cells led to a 2.3-fold increase of cholesterol efflux to apoA-I, whereas co-transfection of SR-BI with ABC1 blocked this increase in cholesterol efflux. SR-BI and ABC1 appear to have distinct and competing roles in mediating cholesterol flux between HDL and macrophages. In nonpolarized cells, SR-BI promotes the reuptake of cholesterol actively effluxed by ABC1, creating a futile cycle.

Eur. Heart J. 1998; 19 (Suppl. A): 31-35Google Scholar). Foam cells, resulting from the accumulation of excess cholesterol in arterial macrophages, play an important role in fatty streak formation and also in the formation of complex lesions and plaque rupture (2Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (9908) Google Scholar). Stimulation of arterial macrophage cholesterol efflux by high density lipoprotein (HDL)1 or apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) can inhibit foam cell formation. It is generally accepted that there are at least two pathways for peripheral cells to remove excess cholesterol. The first one, proposed by Rothblat et al. (3Rothblat G.H. Mahlberg F.H. Johnson W.J. Phillips M.C. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 1091-1097Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is a passive aqueous diffusion pathway. Cholesterol desorbs from the plasma membrane pool to extracellular phospholipid containing acceptor particles, for example, HDL, via a concentration gradient between membrane and acceptor (4Johnson W.J.

Subsequent experiments have suggested that the ability of SR-BI to stimulate cholesterol efflux is independent of binding of ligand to receptor and may reflect reorganization of membrane cholesterol domains, facilitating aqueous diffusion of cholesterol to HDL (7de la Llera-Moya M.

The second pathway, involves the transport of cholesterol to extracellular lipid-free apolipoprotein acceptors, such as apoA-I and apolipoprotein E (9Hara H. Yokoyama S. J. Biol.

In addition, the cAMP induction of cholesterol efflux was shown to be correlated with the up-regulation of ABC1 expression (19Lawn R.M. Wade D.P. Garvin M.R. Wang X. Schwartz K. Porter J.G.

The current study was undertaken to determine a possible interaction between the SR-BI- and ABC1-mediated cholesterol efflux pathways in macrophages. We initially hypothesized that SR-BI and ABC1 might act synergistically on cholesterol efflux, because the nascent HDL particles formed from the ABC1-mediated cholesterol efflux to apoA-I might serve as an acceptor for SR-BI-mediated cholesterol efflux. To assess this hypothesis, we stably transfected mouse macrophage RAW 264 cells with murine SR-BI cDNA and treated the cells with cAMP to induce ABC1 mRNA level. However, contrary to our expectation, we found that SR-BI inhibited ABC1-mediated cholesterol efflux. It appears that SR-BI promotes cellular reuptake of the cholesterol that initially undergoes ABC1-mediated cholesterol efflux to apoA-I, suggesting movement of cholesterol back down a concentration gradient initially created by ABC1. The murine SR-BI cDNA was subcloned into a mammalian expression vector pRc/CMV (Invitrogen) and transfected into RAW 264.7 cells (American Type Culture Collection) using the Effectene Transfection Reagent kit from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). Stable transformants were selected with 0.8 mg/ml of G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Life Technologies, Inc.). Individual colonies were picked and expanded for analysis of SR-BI expression. Three cell lines with different expression level of SR-BI were used in the present study. Their expression level was stable during the experimental period as monitored by immunoblot analysis. For immunoblot analysis of SR-BI, RAW cells were washed and scraped in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, 1 mmMgCl2, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 in the presence of protease inhibitors (0.5 μg/ml Leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Postnuclear supernatants from cell lysates were prepared by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Samples containing the indicated amounts of protein were reduced with 2-mercaptoethanol in gel loading buffer, fractionated by 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to 0.22-μm nitrocellulose membranes. Immunoblotting was performed using an anti-SR-BI antiserum (Novus, Littleton, CO) and ECL chemiluminescence detection (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) The relative intensities of the bands were determined by densitometry (Molecular Dynamics, model 300A). Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was used to obtain a fragment of the murine ABC1 cDNA. Murine ABC1 and β-actin antisense riboprobes were prepared by in vitrotranscription using murine ABC1 and β-actin cDNA plasmid constructs. The protected hybrid fragments for ABC1and β-actin were 290 and 160 base pairs, respectively. In brief, 20 μg of total RNA were hybridized with 5 × 105 cpmABC1 and β-actin riboprobes at 48 °C overnight in 30 μl of a buffer consisting of 40 mm PIPES, pH 6.0, 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 80% formamide. The hybridization mixture was digested with 20 units of T2 ribonuclease (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C for 1 h, extracted with phenol/chloroform, precipitated with ethanol, and dissolved in 5 μl RNA loading buffer. The protected RNA hybrid fragments were resolved on a 6% polyacrylamide/urea gel and subjected to autoradiography. Cells were labeled with [3H]cholesterol by two procedures: cholesterol-normal and cholesterol-loaded conditions. With the cholesterol-normal condition, cell monolayers in 24-well plate were cholesterol-labeled with 0.5 μCi/ml [1,2-3H(N)]cholesterol (NEN Life Science Products) in 0.5 ml of DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. Following 24 h of labeling, cells were equilibrated overnight in DMEM containing 0.2% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Sigma) with or without 0.3 mm cAMP (Sigma). After the labeling and equilibration procedures, the specific activity of the cholesterol pool was similar for control and SR-BI transfected cells ([3H]cholesterol cpm/μg of total cellular cholesterol: control cells with and without cAMP treatment: 4748 ± 258 and 4853 ± 111; SR-BI transfected cells with and without cAMP treatment: 4882 ± 558 and 4909 ± 193). With the cholesterol-loaded condition, cells were labeled overnight by 0.5 μCi/ml [1,2-3H(N)]cholesterol in 0.5 ml of 0.2% BSA and DMEM supplemented with 50 μg/ml acetyl-low density lipoprotein (AcLDL) and then equilibrated in 0.2% BSA and DMEM. After the labeling and equilibration procedures, the specific activity of the cholesterol pool was also similar for control and SR-BI transfected cells ([3H]cholesterol cpm/μg of total cellular cholesterol: control cells with and without cAMP treatment: 19483 ± 420 and 18596 ± 226; SR-BI transfected cells with and without cAMP treatment: 21307 ± 505 and 19548 ± 426). Following two washes with phosphate-buffered saline and 0.2% BSA, cells were incubated by 150 μg/ml human HDL or 10 μg/ml purified human apoA-I (PerImmune) in 0.5 ml of 0.2% BSA and DMEM with or without 0.3 mm cAMP. At different time points, 55 μl of medium was taken, and after precipitation at 6000 ×g for 10 min to remove cell debits and cholesterol crystal, radioactivity in a 50-μl aliquot of supernant was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The cells were finally lysed in 0.5 ml of 0.1 m sodium hydroxide and 0.1% SDS, and the radioactivity in an aliquot was determined. Cholesterol efflux was expressed as the percentage of the radioactivity released from cells into the medium relative to the total radioactivity in cells and medium. Cells in 6-well plates were [3H]cholesterol-labeled and treated with or without cAMP as described above. After 6 h of incubation with apoA-I, media were collected, and cells were lysed in 0.1 m NaON and 0.1% SDS. Lipids were extracted in chloroform:methanol (1:1). The organic residue was dissolved in 0.5% Triton, and cholesterol was determined enzymatically. Cells in 24-well plate were choline-labeled for 24 h in 0.5 ml of 10% FBS and DMEM supplemented with 1.0 μCi/ml [3H]choline (NEN Life Science Products). After overnight equilibration in 0.2% BSA and DMEM with or without 0.3 mm cAMP, the cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and 0.2% BSA and incubated with 150 μg/ml human HDL or 10 μg/ml apoA-I in 0.5 ml of 0.2% BSA and DMEM with or without 0.3 mm cAMP. At different time points, 55 μl of medium was taken and precipitated at 6000 ×g for 10 min to remove cell debits. Then [3H]phospholipid in a 50-μl aliquot of supernant was first extracted by chloroform:methanol (2:1), and then the radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. The cells were finally lysed in 0.5 ml of 0.1 m sodium hydroxide, 0.1% SDS, and the radioactivity in an aliquot after lipid extraction was determined. The percentage of secreted [3H]phospholipid was calculated by dividing the medium-derived counts by the sum of the total. The murine ABC1 cDNA was cloned into a mammalian expression vector pcDNA 3.1 (Invitrogen). The cDNA contains an additional N-terminal 60 amino acids (21Costet P. Luo Y. Wang N. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28240-28245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar), compared with the earlier reported cDNA sequences (22Luciani M.F. Denizot F. Savary S. Mattei M.G. Chimini G. Genomics. 1994; 21: 150-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Transient transfections of ABC1 alone, SR-BI alone, and ABC1+ SR-BI (co-transfection) were performed in 24-well plates using LipofectAMINE reagent according to manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). 5 h after transfection, media were changed to 10% FBS and DMEM containing 0.5 μCi/ml [1,2-3H(N)]cholesterol, and the cells were labeled for 24 h. After equilibration in 0.2% BSA and DMEM overnight, the cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml apoA-I for 6 h in 0.2% BSA and DMEM. Cholesterol efflux was measured at the end of the incubation and expressed as the medium [3H]cholesterol radioactivity as a percentage of total [3H]cholesterol radioactivity (cells plus medium). Results are presented as the means ± S.D. Tests for the significant differences between groups were performed by Student's t test. To compare the SR-BI and ABC1-mediated cholesterol removal pathways, we stably transfected mouse macrophage RAW 264 cells with the murine SR-BI cDNA. We also treated the cells with cAMP to induceABC1 expression. Three cell lines with different SR-BI expression levels were isolated and used in the experiments. Overexpression of SR-BI resulted in an up to ∼2.2-fold increase of cholesterol efflux to HDL in mouse macrophage RAW cells (Fig. 1). The increment of cholesterol efflux because of SR-BI increased with increasing expression levels of SR-BI, as shown in three cell lines with different expression levels (Fig. 1, A andC). In contrast, SR-BI did not stimulate cholesterol efflux to apoA-I (Fig. 1 B). Treating control RAW cells with cAMP induced cholesterol efflux both to HDL and apoA-I during a 6-h incubation period. At the 6-h point, efflux to HDL was increased 2.2-fold, whereas efflux to apoA-I was increased 5.5-fold by cAMP treatment (data not shown). These results were similar to the earlier report of Smith et al. (11Smith J.D. Miyata M. Ginsberg M. Grigaux C. Shmookler E. Plump A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30647-30655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Fig.2 A showed that cAMP induced a similar 3–4-fold increase of ABC1 mRNA expression in both mock vector transfected (mk) and SR-BI transfected cells (SR2), as determined by RNase protection assay.Figure 2SR-BI overexpression inhibits cAMP-induced cholesterol efflux in RAW cells. Control and SR-BI transfected RAW cells were [3H]cholesterol-labeled in 10% FBS and DMEM as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After equilibration in 0.2% BSA and DMEM, with or without 0.3 mm cAMP overnight, the cells were incubated with 150 μg/ml HDL (B) or 10 μg/ml apoA-I (C) for 6 h in 0.2% BSA and DMEM. Cholesterol efflux was expressed as the medium [3H]cholesterol radioactivity as a percentage of total [3H]cholesterol radioactivity (cells plus medium).

Surprisingly, cAMP treatment failed to increase cholesterol efflux to HDL in SR-BI transfected cells (Fig. 2 B), whereas in vector control cells in the same experiment, the efflux was increased 2.2-fold. After cAMP treatment, efflux to apoA-I was increased 3.3-fold in SR-BI transfected cells, compared with a 5.5-fold increase in control cells (Fig. 2 C). The specific activity of [3H]cholesterol was similar in control and SR-BI transfected cells (see “Experimental Procedures”) and could not account for these differences. Moreover, measurement of free cholesterol mass in the medium confirmed the inhibition of cAMP-mediated efflux by SR-BI expression (Fig.3 A). Thus SR-BI overexpression inhibited ABC1-mediated cholesterol efflux to HDL and apoA-I. Both HDL and apoA-I can bind to SR-BI (23Liadaki K.N. Liu T. Xu S. Ishida B.Y. Duchateaux P.N. Krieger J.P.

Krieger M. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1289-1298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and this binding might lead to a lower amount of acceptor available for the ABC1 pathway in SR-BI transfected cells, causing decreased cholesterol efflux. To check this possibility, an efflux experiment was conducted using higher concentration of apoA-I. No further obvious increment of cholesterol efflux was found when 4-fold higher concentration of apoA-I was used as acceptor in cAMP-treated cells (Fig. 4), suggesting that competition for acceptor was not the underlying mechanism. The effect of SR-BI and cAMP treatment on phospholipid efflux was also examined. As shown in Fig. 5, cAMP stimulated phospholipid efflux to HDL and apoA-I, whereas SR-BI overexpression had no such effect. Importantly, SR-BI overexpression did not inhibit the induction of phospholipid efflux by cAMP. This indicates a specific inhibition of the active cholesterol efflux pathway by SR-BI. Cholesterol efflux to HDL and apoA-I in three cell lines with different SR-BI expression levels is shown in Fig.6. With increasing SR-BI expression levels (SR3 > SR2 > SR1; see Fig. 1), the increment in cholesterol efflux to HDL induced by cAMP was progressively smaller (Fig. 6 A). The total efflux after cAMP induction was similar in the three cell lines. In contrast, total cholesterol efflux to apoA-I (Fig. 6 B) was approximately inversely related to the expression level of SR-BI in the three lines treated with cAMP. The above effects of SR-BI and cAMP on cholesterol efflux were also investigated when cells were cholesterol-loaded by AcLDL (50 μg/ml). In contrast to earlier results (Fig. 1), in cholesterol-loaded cells, there was no stimulation of efflux to HDL by SR-BI overexpression (Fig.7 A). However, SR-BI inhibited cAMP-stimulated cholesterol efflux when cells were cholesterol-loaded. Similar results were obtained when either HDL or apoA-I was used as acceptors (Fig. 7). Compared with a large increase of cholesterol efflux to HDL (2.5-fold at 6 h) or apoA-I (11.2-fold at 6 h) resulting from cAMP treatment in cholesterol-loaded control cells, SR-BI transfected cells had only a 1.5-fold increase in cholesterol efflux to HDL and 5-fold increase to apoA-I. The decreased efflux to apoA-I in cells expressing SR-BI was also confirmed by direct mass measurement (Fig. 3 B). The data indicate that when cells are cholesterol-loaded, SR-BI does not increase efflux from intracellular cholesterol stores but does inhibit the ABC1-mediated cholesterol efflux. Because cAMP treatment might stimulate cholesterol efflux by several different mechanisms, we carried out further experiment to directly examine the role of SR-BI on ABC1-mediated cholesterol efflux. Thus, 293 cells were transfected with ABC1 alone, SR-BI alone, and ABC1 plus SR-BI (co-transfection) (Fig. 8). ABC1 transfection led to a 2.3-fold increase of cholesterol efflux to apoA-I. SR-BI transfection had no effect on cholesterol efflux to apoA-I. However, the overexpression of SR-BI led to a marked inhibition of ABC1-mediated cholesterol efflux. Thus, the inhibition of cholesterol efflux in cAMP-treated macrophages by SR-BI likely reflects an effect on ABC1. To examine whether the inhibiting effect of SR-BI on ABC1-mediated cholesterol efflux could be reversed by an SR-BI neutralizing antibody, we used an antibody to the extracellular domain of SR-BI, 2From Novus, Littleton, CO, whole rabbit serum. which inhibits selective uptake of HDL cholesterol ester (25Temel R.E.

First, SR-BI transfected and control RAW cells were [3H]cholesterol-labeled and incubated with cAMP to induce ABC1. Then they were incubated with apoA-I plus different concentrations of SR-BI neutralizing antibody, and cellular cholesterol efflux was measured after 6 h of incubation. Fig.9 shows that the SR-BI neutralizing antibody treatment resulted in a dose-dependent and time-dependent increase of cholesterol efflux to apoA-I both in control and SR-BI transfected cells treated with cAMP. Control rabbit purified IgG had no effect (data not shown). The data indicate that SR-BI inhibits ABC1-mediated cholesterol efflux in both control cells with relatively low SR-BI expression level and in SR-BI transfected cells. To investigate the mechanism by which this SR-BI antibody stimulated cholesterol efflux, we determined whether the antibody had any effect on cholesterol efflux in basal condition (i.e. without cAMP treatment). This revealed that the antibody did not inhibit and even slightly stimulated SR-BI-dependent cholesterol efflux (Fig. 10). In contrast, we confirmed that this antibody inhibited SR-BI-mediated uptake of HDL-free cholesterol and cholesterol ester by 70% and also inhibited the SR-BI-mediated HDL cell association (not shown) (25Temel R.E.

These data are consistent with studies showing that HDL lipid selective uptake requires binding of HDL to SR-BI (26Gu X. Trigatti B. Xu S. Acton S. Babitt J. Krieger M. J. Biol.

Rothblat G.H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the stimulation of cholesterol efflux by the antibody (Fig. 9) is related to the antibody blocking reuptake of nascent cholesterol effluxed via ABC1. To directly examine this futile cycle model, ABC1 transfected 293 cells were [3H]cholesterol-labeled and incubated with apoA-I for 4 h. Then the whole media were collected and concentrated to isolate nascent HDL particles formed from ABC1-mediated cholesterol efflux. Subsequently, the whole concentrated media were placed onto SR-BI transfected and control cells to measure cholesterol reuptake during 1 h of incubation. Fig. 11showed that the reuptake of cholesterol from nascent HDL particles in SR-BI transfected cells was 27% higher than that in control cells. Similar results were obtained when the nascent particles were isolated from control RAW cells treated with cAMP. The data indicate that the reuptake of the nascent HDL cholesterol at least partly accounts for the inhibition of ABC1-mediated cholesterol efflux by SR-BI. The goal of the present study was to test the hypothesis that SR-BI and ABC1 might have synergistic roles in promoting cholesterol efflux from macrophages. Overexpression of SR-BI in RAW macrophages did result in increased cholesterol efflux to HDL under basal conditions. However, in agreement with earlier findings (6Ji Y. Jian B. Wang N.

Previous studies indicated that transcription of myogenin was dependent on MyoD and MEF2 proteins.

Rosenthal N. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 11Florini J.R. Muscle Nerve. 1987; 7: 577-598Crossref Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 12Quinn L.S. Steinmetz B.

Studies have indicated that the effects of IGF-I on proliferation and differentiation are temporally separated. In proliferating myoblasts, IGFs increase the expression of factors involved in cell cycle progression (10Engert J.C. Berglund E.B. Rosenthal N. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 13Rosenthal S.M. Cheng Z.-Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10307-10311Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). After myoblasts are withdrawn from the cell cycle, IGFs promote muscle differentiation by inducing the expression or activity of myogenic regulatory factors (14Musaro A. Rosenthal N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3115-3124Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). It was recently suggested that IGFs induce these two functions by activating separate signal transduction pathways (15Coolican S.A. Samuel D.S. Ewton D.Z. McWade F.J. Florini J.R. J. Biol.

Proliferation is mediated by the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway, whereas differentiation is mediated by phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-K). Several studies proved the involvement of PI3-K in differentiation by inhibition of its activity. Two approaches were used: treatment of cells with chemical inhibitors like LY294002 and wortmannin or expression of a mutated form of the regulatory subunit of PI3-K, p85, functioning as a dominant negative (15Coolican S.A.

PI3-K activates downstream molecules like protein kinase B (PKB). The involvement of PKB in muscle differentiation was recently demonstrated. PKB induces muscle-specific transcription (17Jiang B.H. Aoki M. Zheng J.Z. Li J. Vogt P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2077-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) and functions as a positive mediator of muscle cell survival (20Fujio Y. Guo K. Mano T. Mitsuuchi Y. Testa J.R. Walsh K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5073-5082Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). No other molecules that function downstream to PI3-K and PKB have so far been identified as being involved in myogenesis. Some earlier studies suggested that IGF-I induced the expression of myogenin in L6 myoblasts (21Florini J.R. Ewton D.Z. Roof S.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 718-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The induction of myogenin expression did not occur immediately following administration of IGF-I, suggesting that the effect was not direct and involved intermediary molecules. The present study aimed at understanding how PI3-K affects muscle-specific transcription. We suggest that PI3-K affects skeletal muscle differentiation by inducing the transcriptional activity of MEF2 proteins. Our results explain why PI3-K is necessary for the expression of myogenin and of late muscle differentiation genes. LY294002 and SB203580 were supplied by Calbiochem.

Cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% calf serum (Hyclone), penicillin, and streptomycin (growth medium (GM)). To induce differentiation, we used Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10 μg/ml insulin and 10 μg/ml transferrin (differentiation medium (DM)). Differentiation of 10T1/2 cells that expressed MyoD-ER protein was induced by the addition of DM that contained 10−7m estradiol. LY294002 and SB203580 were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide to a concentration of 10 mm that was added directly to the differentiation medium to a final concentration of 10–20 μm, as indicated. Control cells were incubated with the same volumes of dimethyl sulfoxide without the inhibitors. The medium was replaced every 24 h by medium containing fresh inhibitor. Transfections were performed by calcium phosphate precipitation as described (34Davis R.L. Cheng P.F. Lassar A.B. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 60: 733-746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar) or using the TransFast reagent of Promega according to the recommended protocol. Cells in 6-cm TC dishes (Corning) were transfected with a total amount of 10 μg (or 5 μg, using TransFast) of the following plasmid DNA: 1 μg of pCMV-LacZ or pMSV-LacZ, 3 μg of CAT reporter gene, 3 μg of the various expression vectors. “Empty vectors” of pCDNA3 or EMSV containing promoters of cytomegalovirus and murine sarcoma virus long terminal repeat, respectively, were added to equalize the promoter content in each transfection experiment. Following transfection, the medium was replaced with either GM or DM for another 24–48 h. Transfection efficiencies were tested in soluble X-gal assays, and amounts of extracts used for the CAT assays were adjusted accordingly (35Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5286) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline and then fixed in 0.5% gluteraldehyde and washed again in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were then incubated for 3 h at 37 °C in the dark with the following staining solution: 1 mg/ml X-gal, 5 mm K4Fe(CN)6, 5 mm K3Fe(CN)6, 2 mmMgCl2. Stained cells were photographed. Cells were fixed and immunostained as described (36Gredinger E. Gerber A.N. Tamir Y. Tapscott S.J. Bengal E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10436-10444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The primary antibodies used were polyclonal anti-MyoD (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and monoclonal anti-MHC (MF-20). The immunochemically stained cells were viewed at × 200 magnification in a fluorescence microscope (Olympus, model BX50) and photographed. RNA was extracted using TRI REAGENT™ (MRC Inc.) and analyzed by Northern blotting as described (36Gredinger E. Gerber A.N. Tamir Y. Tapscott S.J. Bengal E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10436-10444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Blots were hybridized with probes for MEF2A (pCDNA-MEF2A), myogenin (pEMSV-myogenin), myosin light chain 2 (MLC2) (PVZLC2), p21 (pCDNA-Waf1), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (pMGAP). Cells were lysed as described for the kinase assays, and equal amounts of extracted proteins (30–100 μg) were loaded and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. Membrane was incubated in blocking buffer (1× TBS, 0.1% Tween 20, 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk) and then with the same buffer with the first and secondary antibodies. Between the second and third incubations, membranes were washed three times in 0.1% Tween 20 and 1× TBS. Immunoblotting was conducted with the following antibodies: anti-PKB, anti-phospho-PKB (New England BioLabs), anti-p38 MAPK (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-phospho-p38 MAPK (Thr180/Tyr182) (New England BioLabs) (1:1000). Proteins were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence kit of Pierce. Cells were incubated in methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and dialyzed calf serum for 40 min and then incubated with 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine for 3 h before proteins were extracted in radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, and 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). L8 cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without sodium phosphate, to which [32P]orthophosphate was added at 0.75 mCi/ml for 3 h before proteins were extracted in radioimmune precipitation buffer. Equal amounts of labeled proteins were incubated with antibody to MEF2 for 2 h and an additional 1 h with protein A-Sepharose beads. Beads were washed four times with radioimmune precipitation buffer containing 0.5m NaCl and once in radioimmune precipitation buffer. Beads were resuspended in SDS sample buffer, and proteins were separated over 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The double-stranded DNA probe contained a binding site of MEF2 from the MCK enhancer region. The sequence of the sense strand was 5′-AGCTCGCTCTAAAAATAACCCTGGATCC-3′. Proteins were extracted from 10T1/2 MyoD-ER cells that were induced to differentiate in DM and estradiol (10−7m) during 24 h in the absence or presence of 20 μm of LY294002. 20 μg of proteins in binding buffer (10% glycerol, 2 mm spermidine, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9) were added to 500 ng of poly(dI-dC)-poly(dI-dC) and labeled probe (50,000 cpm, ∼1 ng). Proteins and DNA were incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Unlabeled competitor DNA or a specific antibody to MEF2 was incubated with proteins on ice prior to the addition of labeled probe. DNA-protein complexes were separated over 4% native polyacrylamide gel (0.25× TBE). PI3-K is involved in early stages of myoblast cell differentiation. The involvement of PI3-K in skeletal muscle differentiation was previously demonstrated using different approaches to inhibit this kinase (15Coolican S.A. Samuel D.S. Ewton D.Z. McWade F.J.

Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 66-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In order to study the involvement of PI3-K in the differentiation of L8 myoblasts, we added insulin to these cells at concentrations known to bind the IGF-I receptor (37Florini J.R. Magri K.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: 701-711Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To find out whether the PI3-K pathway was activated, we monitored the phosphorylation state of PKB, which is downstream to PI3-K in the pathway. We found that phosphorylation of PKB was induced immediately after the addition of insulin to cells and gradually declined to its basal levels after 24 h (Fig.1 A). Phosphorylation of PKB was prevented in cells treated with LY294002, an inhibitor of PI3-K, suggesting that PKB phosphorylation was dependent on the activity of PI3-K (Fig. 1 B, lane 3). Phosphorylation of PKB was only marginally reduced in cells treated with SB203580, an inhibitor of p38 MAPK (Fig. 1 B,lane 4). Like insulin, treatment of myoblasts with IGF-1 induced the phosphorylation of PKB (data not shown). The immediate transient phosphorylation of PKB suggests that the pathway may be involved in the differentiation process during this time window. To test this possibility, L8 cells were induced to differentiate for 48 h, during which LY294002 was added for different periods of time. An inhibitor that was added during the first 24 h and then removed prevented differentiation as reflected by the low expression of MLC2 (Fig. 1 C, lane 4). An inhibitor added for 24 h after a delay of 24 h did not affect differentiation (Fig. 1 C, lane 5). These results suggest that PI3-K is involved during early stages of the differentiation process. The involvement of PI3-K during the initial 24 h of muscle differentiation prompted us to analyze the expression of “early induced genes” that are turned on during that period of time. We chose to study a 10T1/2 cell line expressing a chimera protein of MyoD and the hormone-binding domain of estrogen receptor (MyoD-ER) (33Hollenberg S.M. Cheng P.F. Weintraub H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8028-8032Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The chimera protein resides in an inactive form in the cytoplasm of cells. The addition of estradiol induces its translocation to the nucleus, where it activates the expression of muscle genes. Induction of myogenesis in this cell line follows a very precise timetable, since it depends on the activation of the MyoD-ER protein. Cells were induced to differentiate in the absence or presence of LY294002, and the expression of several genes was analyzed (Fig.2 A). The expression of myogenin and myosin light chain 2 was significantly repressed in cells grown in the presence of the PI3-K inhibitor compared with cells that were induced to differentiate in the absence of the inhibitor (comparelanes 2–4 with lanes 5–7). However, the expression of p21-WAF1 and MEF2A was not affected in cells treated with the inhibitor. It was previously suggested that the expression of these two genes is dependent on the MyoD protein (38Yu Y.T. Breitbart R.E. Smoot L.B. Lee Y. Mahdavi V. Nadal-Ginard B. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1783-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 39Halevy O. Novitch B.G. Spicer D.B. Skapek S.X. Rhee J. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Lassar A.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1018-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). Therefore, the results in Fig. 2 Aindicate that the activity of the MyoD-ER protein was not affected, while other transcription factor(s) needed for the expression of myogenin and MLC2 genes were inhibited. To test this possibility, cells were induced to differentiate in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (Fig. 2 B, lane 4). Under these conditions, genes that are directly induced by MyoD independently of newly synthesized transcriptional mediators can be identified. The expression of p21-WAF1 and MEF2A was not affected, while that of myogenin and MLC2 was totally prevented in the presence of cycloheximide (compare lane 3 withlane 4). These results indicate that the activity of MyoD is not sufficient to induce the transcription of myogenin. The transcription of myogenin is affected by an additional transcription factor(s) that may be inhibited in cells grown in the presence of LY294002. To test whether the inhibitor of PI3-K affected the promoter activity of myogenin, we studied a reporter gene that contained the myogenin promoter driving the expression of the lacZgene. The promoter was active in 10T1/2 cells expressing the MyoD-ER protein after their treatment with estradiol, as visualized by β-galactosidase staining (Fig. 3). The expression of this reporter gene was inhibited in cells grown in the presence of LY294002, as observed by the lesser number of β-galactosidase-stained cells (Fig. 3). The addition of LY294002 to cells transfected with another reporter gene driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter did not affect the activity of this promoter. Hence, LY294002 specifically inhibited the expression of the myogenin promoter, suggesting that PI3-K activity was involved in the transcription of myogenin.Figure 3Treatment of 10T1/2 MyoD-ER cells with LY294002 inhibits the expression of a myogenin promoter-reporter gene. 10T1/2 cells expressing the MyoD-ER protein were transfected with a lacZ reporter gene driven by the promoter of myogenin, or with a lacZ reporter gene driven by the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. The activity of MyoD-ER protein was induced by adding DM and estradiol to cells in the absence or presence of LY294002. The activity of the promoter was analyzed by a β-galactosidase in situ staining assay (see “Experimental Procedures”). Similar results were obtained in a second independent experiment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The myogenin promoter contains binding sites for MyoD and MEF2 family members (40Edmondson D.G. Cheng T.C. Cserjesi P. Chakraborty T. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3665-3677Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). In transgenic mice models, it was shown that both binding sites were necessary and sufficient for muscle-specific transcription of this gene (26Cheng T.C. Wallace M.C. Merlie J.P. Olson E.N. Science. 1993; 261: 215-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). To analyze which of these transcription factors was affected by the PI3-K pathway, the activities of MyoD and MEF2 transcription factors were independently analyzed. 10T1/2 cells were transfected with an expression vector of MyoD and a specific reporter gene containing a minimal promoter and MyoD binding sites (4R-tk-CAT) or an expression vector of MEF2C and a reporter gene containing MEF2 binding sites (MEF2-MCK-CAT). Each transcription factor induced the expression of its respective reporter gene (Fig.4, lanes 2 and6). Treatment of the transfected cells with the inhibitor of PI3-K, LY294002, or transfection of a dominant negative form of PI3-K (p85ΔiSH2-N) significantly inhibited the activity of MEF2 (lanes 7 and 8) while only marginally affecting the activity of MyoD (lanes 3 and4). These findings indicate that PI3-K is involved in the activity of the MEF2C transcription factor. The inhibition of myogenin expression by the PI3-K inhibitor observed in Figs. 2 and 3 might be mediated by suppression of MEF2 activity. Classical transcriptional activators contain two separate activities: DNA binding and transactivation. Using a gel shift assay, we examined whether inhibition of PI3-K affected the DNA binding activity of MEF2 in the 10T1/2 cells expressing the chimera MyoD-ER protein. MEF2 binding activity was significantly induced in extracts of cells treated with estradiol (Fig.5 A, lane 2 versus lane 3), confirming previous results and those shown in Fig. 2 according to which MEF2 expression was induced during muscle differentiation (38Yu Y.T. Breitbart R.E. Smoot L.B. Lee Y. Mahdavi V. Nadal-Ginard B. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1783-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar,41Gossett L.A. Kelvin D.J. Sternberg E.A. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5022-5033Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Treatment of the cells with LY294002 during the period at which they were induced to differentiate did not affect the DNA binding activity of MEF2 proteins (Fig. 5 A, lane 4). The binding was specific, as demonstrated by homologous competition and supershift of the complex with a specific MEF2 antibody (Fig. 5 A, lanes 5 and 6). Therefore, the DNA binding activity of MEF2 is not affected when PI3-K is inhibited. The transactivation potential of MEF2 was studied in a GAL4 activator/reporter system. The transcriptional activators were chimeric proteins consisting of the transactivation domain (TAD) of MEF2 and the DNA-binding domain of the yeast GAL4 protein. The reporter gene contained GAL4 binding sites in the promoter. Using this system, we analyzed the activity of MEF2 TAD independently of its DNA binding activity. The transcriptional activities of several chimera activators were analyzed, all of which activated the transcription from the GAL4 reporter gene (Fig. 5 B). Treatment of the transfected cells with LY294002 inhibited the activity of GAL4-MEF2 proteins (Fig.5 B, lanes 2 and 4) but did not affect the activities of GAL4-MyoD or GAL4-VP16 (lanes 6 and 8). We suggest therefore that the effect of PI3-K inhibitor is specific to the TAD of MEF2 proteins. Given that the TAD of MEF2 protein is a target for PI3-K, we assumed that artificial activation of MEF2 could bypass the requirement for PI3-K activity. We tested a chimera protein containing the MEF2 DNA-binding domain (amino acids 1–117) linked to the VP16 TAD (MEF2C-VP16) in the activation of MEF2-responsive genes (28Molkentin J.D. Black B.L. Martin J.F. Olson E.N. Cell. 1995; 83: 1125-1136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). Both MEF2C and MEF2C-VP16 activated transcription from a muscle creatine kinase reporter gene (pe+AT-CAT) (Fig. 6 A, lanes 2 and 6). Treatment of cells with LY294002 or the expression of a mutated form of the regulatory subunit of PI3-K (p85ΔiSH2-N) significantly inhibited MCK transcription in cells transfected with MEF2C but did not affect transcription in cells transfected with MEF2C-VP16 expression vector (compare lanes 3 and 5 with lanes 7 and9). Similar results were obtained when we analyzed the transcription of a minimal promoter containing MEF2 binding sites (data not shown). To analyze whether MEF2C-VP16 can rescue the expression of endogenous muscle genes, we transfected expression vectors of MyoD and MEF2C, or alternatively MEF2C-VP16, to 10T1/2 cells that were induced to differentiate in the absence or presence of LY294002. We followed the expression of endogenous myosin heavy chain in the transfected cells by immunostaining with specific antibodies to MyoD and MHC (Fig.6 B). Treatment of cells transfected with exp"
https://openalex.org/W2076576843,"We previously reported that fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) acts not only on osteoblasts to stimulate osteoclastic bone resorption indirectly but also on mature osteoclasts directly. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of this direct action of FGF-2 on mature osteoclasts using mouse and rabbit osteoclast culture systems. FGF-2 stimulated pit formation resorbed by isolated rabbit osteoclasts moderately from low concentrations (≥10−12m), whereas at high concentrations (≥10−9m) it showed stimulation on pit formation resorbed by unfractionated bone cells very potently. FGF-2 (≥10−12m) also increased cathepsin K and MMP-9 mRNA levels in mouse and rabbit osteoclasts. Among FGF receptors (FGFR1 to 4) only FGFR1 was detected on isolated mouse osteoclasts, whereas all FGFRs were identified on mouse osteoblasts. FGF-2 (≥10−12m) up-regulated the phosphorylation of cellular proteins, including p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, and increased the kinase activity of immunoprecipitated FGFR1 in mouse osteoclasts. The stimulation of FGF-2 on mouse and rabbit osteoclast functions was abrogated by PD-98059, a specific inhibitor of p42/p44 MAP kinase. These results strongly suggest that FGF-2 acts directly on mature osteoclasts through activation of FGFR1 and p42/p44 MAP kinase, causing the stimulation of bone resorption at physiological or pathological concentrations. We previously reported that fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) acts not only on osteoblasts to stimulate osteoclastic bone resorption indirectly but also on mature osteoclasts directly. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of this direct action of FGF-2 on mature osteoclasts using mouse and rabbit osteoclast culture systems. FGF-2 stimulated pit formation resorbed by isolated rabbit osteoclasts moderately from low concentrations (≥10−12m), whereas at high concentrations (≥10−9m) it showed stimulation on pit formation resorbed by unfractionated bone cells very potently. FGF-2 (≥10−12m) also increased cathepsin K and MMP-9 mRNA levels in mouse and rabbit osteoclasts. Among FGF receptors (FGFR1 to 4) only FGFR1 was detected on isolated mouse osteoclasts, whereas all FGFRs were identified on mouse osteoblasts. FGF-2 (≥10−12m) up-regulated the phosphorylation of cellular proteins, including p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, and increased the kinase activity of immunoprecipitated FGFR1 in mouse osteoclasts. The stimulation of FGF-2 on mouse and rabbit osteoclast functions was abrogated by PD-98059, a specific inhibitor of p42/p44 MAP kinase. These results strongly suggest that FGF-2 acts directly on mature osteoclasts through activation of FGFR1 and p42/p44 MAP kinase, causing the stimulation of bone resorption at physiological or pathological concentrations. fibroblast growth factor-2 fibroblast growth factor receptor cyclooxygenase 2 receptor tyrosine kinase mitogen-activated protein polymerase chain reaction α-modified essential medium fetal bovine serum macrophage colony-stimulating factor c-Jun N-terminal kinase tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase phosphate-buffered saline matrix metalloproteinase reverse transcriptase base pair(s) glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 4-amino-5-(4-methylphenyl)-1-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis M-CSF-dependent bone marrow macrophages tumor necrosis factor 2′-amino-3′-methoxyflanone 4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-(4-methylsulfinylphenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl)- 1H-imidazole Among many growth factors regulating bone metabolism, fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2 or basic FGF)1 is recognized as a potent mitogen for a variety of mesenchymal cells (1Rifkin D.B.

In bone tissues, FGF-2 is produced by cells of osteoblastic lineage, is accumulated in bone matrix, and acts as an autocrine/paracrine factor for bone cells (6Canalis E. Centrella M. McCarthy T.L. J.

We and others have reported that the exogenous application of FGF-2 has stimulatory effects on bone formation in several in vivo models as a pharmacological action of FGF-2 (11Aspenberg P.

On the other hand, in vitro studies revealed that high concentrations of FGF-2 (10−9–10−8m) stimulated osteoclastogenesis in bone marrow culture (18Hurley M.M. Lee S.K. Raisz L.G. Bernecker P. Lorenzo J. Bone. 1998; 22: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and bone resorption in bone organ cultures (19Simmons H.A. Raisz L.G. J. Bone Miner.

Invest. 1995; 96: 923-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). This stimulatory effect of FGF-2 on bone resorption is known to be mediated at least in part by cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) induction and prostaglandin production (18Hurley M.M. Lee S.K. Raisz L.G. Bernecker P. Lorenzo J. Bone. 1998; 22: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 20Kawaguchi H. Pilbeam C.C. Gronowicz G. Abreu C. Fletcher B.S. Herschman H.R. Raisz L.G. Hurley M.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 923-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), which cause the expression of osteoclast differentiation factor (RANKL/ODF), a key membrane-associated molecule that regulates osteoclast differentiation, in osteoblastic cells (21Nakagawa N. Yasuda H. Yano K. Mochizuki S. Kobayashi N. Fujimoto H. Shima N. Morinaga T. Chikazu D. Kawaguchi H. Higashio K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 265: 158-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Other than this indirect action through the mediation of osteoblasts, we recently reported that FGF-2 acts directly on mature osteoclasts to stimulate bone resorption (22Kawaguchi H. Chikazu D. Nakamura K. Kumegawa M. Hakeda Y. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 466-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). There are four structurally related high affinity receptors (FGFR1 to 4) belonging to receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) that have an intrinsic protein-tyrosine kinase activity and elicit tyrosine autophosphorylation of the receptor (23Coughlin S.R. Barr P.J. Cousens L.S. Fretto L.J. Williams L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 988-993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Johnson D.E. Williams L.T. Adv. Cancer Res. 1993; 60: 1-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar). Because it is located downstream of the autophosphorylation of FGFRs, mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase has been reported to be the major signaling pathway in neuronal and endothelial cells (25Klint P. Kanda S. Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23337-23344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 26Kouhara H. Hadari Y.R. Spivak-Kroizman T. Schilling J.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3354-3364Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In osteoblasts, MAP kinase activation followed by the autophosphorylation of FGFR1 and 2 is also involved in FGF-2 signaling (28Suzuki A. Shinoda J. Kanda S. Oiso Y. Kozawa O. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 63: 491-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 29Kozawa O. Tokuda H. Matsuno H. Uematsu T. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 74: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Osteoclastic bone resorption is regulated by two different steps: one is the recruitment and differentiation of osteoclasts and the other is the activation of mature osteoclast function. Although a number of signaling pathways through the mediation of osteoblasts for osteoclast differentiation have been clarified, little is known about the signaling to stimulate mature osteoclast function directly. A recent study of random sequence analysis of PCR-amplified cDNA clones identified 14 distinct kinase-related genes in purified rabbit mature osteoclasts (30Nakamura Y.S. Hakeda Y. Takakura N. Kameda T. Hamaguchi I. Miyamoto T. Kakudo S. Nakano T. Kumegawa M. Suda T. Stem Cells. 1998; 16: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Eight of these genes were identified as RTKs: Tie, c-Kit, Fms, Met,Axl, Tyro3, INS-R, andFGFR1. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism whereby FGF-2 stimulates mature osteoclast function using mouse and rabbit osteoclast culture systems. Studies on the signaling pathway were performed using isolated mouse osteoclasts; however, for those on the resorbing activity, isolated rabbit osteoclasts were used because mouse osteoclasts do not have enough potency to resorb bone after being isolated. Neonatal, 5-week-old, and 8-week-old male ddY mice were purchased from the Shizuoka Laboratories Animal Center (Shizuoka, Japan). 10-day-old male Japanese white rabbits were purchased from Saitama Experimental Animal Co. (Saitama, Japan). Human recombinant FGF-2 was kindly provided by Kaken Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. (Chiba, Japan) and NS-398 by Taisho Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). α-modified minimum essential medium (αMEM) was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. (Rockville, MD), and fetal bovine serum (FBS) was from the Cell Culture Laboratory (Cleveland, OH). Macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) was from Austral Biologicals (San Ramon, CA). Bacterial collagenase, 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D3, and ISOGEN were purchased from Wako Pure Chemicals Co. (Osaka, Japan), and dispase from Nitta Gelatin Co. (Osaka). Polyclonal rabbit antibody against phosphotyrosine was obtained from UBI (Lake Placid, NY), and monoclonal mouse antibody against p60v-src(monoclonal antibody 327) was obtained from Oncogene Research Products (Cambridge, MA). This antibody recognizes specifically both p60v-src and p60c-src and has been used to determine the expression of p60c-src in various primary cells and clonal cell lines. Polyclonal rabbit antibodies against mouse FGFR1 through 4 and nonimmune IgG, as well as blocking peptides for respective antibodies, were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Polyclonal rabbit antibodies against phospho-p44/42 MAP kinase, phospho-p38 MAP kinase, phospho-c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK), and 2′-amino-3′-methoxyflanone (PD-98059) were obtained from New England BioLabs, Inc. (Beverly, MA). 4-(4-Fluorophenyl)-2-(4-methylsulfinylphenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl)-1H-imidazole (SB-203580) and Pronase were purchased from Calbiochem-Novobiochem Co. (La Jolla, CA). [32P]dCTP and [γ-32P]ATP were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Other chemicals were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). Purified mature osteoclasts were prepared using 10-day-old rabbits as described previously (31Kameda T. Miyazawa K. Mori Y. Yuasa T. Shiokawa M. Nakamura Y. Mano H. Hakeda Y. Kameda A. Kumegawa M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 220: 515-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Briefly, long bones from 10-day-old rabbits were minced with scissors and agitated with a vortex mixer. An aliquot of unfractionated bone cells was seeded onto 0.24% collagen gel (Nitta Gelatin, Tokyo) coated on 100-mm tissue culture dishes and incubated. 2 h later, nonadherent cells were washed off and osteoclasts were then removed from the gels with 0.1% collagenase solution (Wako Pure Chemicals Co.). By staining with tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP), we ascertained that more than 99% of isolated cells were pure osteoclasts. Purified osteoclasts (150 cells/well) or unfractionated bone cells (5 × 104 cells/well) were cultured on a dentine slice placed in each well of 96-well dishes containing 0.1 ml of αMEM/5% FBS. FGF-2 (10−11m), NS-398 (1 μm), PD-98059 (1, 3, 10, and 30 μm), and SB-203580 (30 μm) were added 1 h after the seeding. After 24 h of culture, cells on the dentine slices were removed with 1 n NH4OH solution, and stained with 0.5% toluidine blue for 1 min. The total area of pits was estimated under a light microscope with a micrometer to assess osteoclastic bone resorption using an image analyzer (System Supply Co., Nagano, Japan). Rabbit osteoclasts were isolated on plastic dishes as described previously (32Tezuka K. Sato T. Kamioka H. Nijweide P.J. Tanaka K. Matsuo T. Ohta M. Kurihara N. Hakeda Y. Kumegawa M. Bone Miner. 1992; 17: 347-359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Briefly, the above unfractionated bone cells from rabbit long bones were plated on 100-mm tissue culture dishes at 1 × 108 living cells per dish. After an overnight culture, the cells were incubated with 0.001% Pronase and 0.02% EDTA in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. By this incubation, cells other than osteoclasts became detached from the dishes and were washed off. After the Pronase E and EDTA treatment, more than 99% of the adherent cells were ascertained to be osteoclasts by TRAP-positive results and multinucleated. After purification, osteoclasts were further incubated for 2 h with αMEM containing 5% FBS. Osteoclasts were prepared using ddY mice as described previously (33Akatsu T. Tamura T. Takahashi N. Udagawa N. Tanaka S. Sasaki T. Yamaguchi A. Nagata N. Suda T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1992; 7: 1297-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Briefly, primary mouse osteoblastic cells were prepared from calvariae of neonatal ddY mice and bone marrow cells prepared from tibiae of 8-week-old male ddY mice. Osteoblastic cells (2 × 106 cells/dish) and bone marrow cells (2 × 107 cells/dish) were co-cultured in 100-mm tissue culture dishes containing αMEM with 10% FBS and 1,25(OH)2vitamin D3 (10−8m) for 7 days with a medium change every 2 days. After 7 days of culture, 2–4 × 104 osteoclasts/dish were usually yielded. The dishes were then treated with 0.001% Pronase and 0.02% EDTA in PBS for 10 min to remove osteoblastic cells. More than 99% of the adherent cells prepared were TRAP-positive and multinucleated. These cells were incubated for 2 h with αMEM containing 10% FBS. Total RNA from isolated mouse or rabbit osteoclasts was extracted using ISOGEN, and 5 μg of total RNA was run on a 1.2% agarose-2.2 m formaldehyde gel, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane by positive pressure, and fixed to the membrane by ultraviolet irradiation. After 1 h of prehybridization in GMC buffer (0.5 m Na2HPO4, 1% bovine serum albumin, 1 mm EDTA, and 7% SDS, pH 7.2) at 60 °C, filters were hybridized overnight in GMC buffer at 65 °C with a random primer [32P]dCTP-labeled cDNA probe for cathepsin K, MMP-9, or MMP-14. A cDNA fragment from rabbit osteoclasts was used as a probe for cathepsin K (34Tezuka K. Tezuka Y. Maejima A. Sato T. Nemoto K. Kamioka H. Hakeda Y. Kumegawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1106-1109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). cDNA probes for MMP-9 and -14 were generated by RT-PCR with the total RNA from mouse osteoclasts. The primers for MMP-9 were: sense, 5′-CTGTCCAGACCAAGGGTACAGCCT-3′; antisense, 5′-GTGGTATAGTGGGACACATAGTGG-3′. The primers for MMP-14 were: sense, 5′-GAGATCAAGGCCAATGTTCGGAGG-3′; antisense, 5′-TTAGATCCTCATTTTGGACAGTCC-3′. PCR consisted of 25 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 60 °C for 45 s, and extension at 72 °C for 60 s. The PCR products for MMP-9 and -14 were 263 bp and 382 bp, respectively. Filters were washed in 1× SSC (0.15 m NaCl, 15 mmNa3 citrate, pH 7.0)/0.1% SDS twice for 15 min at 65 °C, then once for 15 min in 0.1× SSC/0.1% SDS at 65 °C. Signals were quantitated by densitometry (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Richmond, CA), and optical densities for cathepsin K, MMP-9, and MMP-14 were normalized to the corresponding values for G3PDH. To obtain viable mouse osteoclasts formed in the co-culture, a collagen gel culture was performed as described previously (32Tezuka K. Sato T. Kamioka H. Nijweide P.J. Tanaka K. Matsuo T. Ohta M. Kurihara N. Hakeda Y. Kumegawa M. Bone Miner. 1992; 17: 347-359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Briefly, primary mouse osteoblastic cells and bone marrow cells were co-cultured on 100-mm culture dishes coated with 0.2% collagen gel matrix (Nitta Gelatin) in αMEM containing 10% FBS and 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D3 (10−8m) for 6 days, with a medium change every 2 days, and for 1 additional day in αMEM/10% FBS. After culture for 7 days, dishes were treated with 4 ml of 0.2% bacterial collagenase in αMEM for 20 min at 37 °C. Cells released from the dishes were collected by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 5 min and suspended in 5 ml of αMEM containing 10% FBS. An aliquot of crude osteoclast preparation (0.1 ml) was replaced in 24-well dishes, and further cultured. After incubation for 2 h, the plates were treated with 0.001% Pronase E and 0.02% EDTA for 10 min to remove osteoblastic cells. After purification, osteoclasts were cultured in the presence or absence of FGF-2 (10−11 or 10−8m) or M-CSF (2000 units/ml) for various periods up to 48 h, fixed with citrate-acetone-formaldehyde fixative for 30 s, and stained with trypan blue and TRAP. Trypan blue-negative and TRAP-positive osteoclasts were counted. Total RNA was extracted from mouse osteoclasts and osteoblasts using ISOGEN following the manufacturer's instructions, and 2 μg of RNA was reverse-transcribed and amplified by PCR. The primers for FGFR1 through 4 were as follows: FGFR1: sense, 5′-TGGAGTTCATGTGCAAGGTG-3′; antisense, 5′-ATAGAGAGGACCATCCTGTG-3′, FGFR2: sense, 5′-AAATACCAAATCTCCCAACC-3′; antisense, 5′-GCCGCTTCTCCATCTTCT-3′, FGFR3: sense, 5′-ACTGTACTCAAGACTGCAGG-3′; antisense, 5′-GTCCTTGTCAGTCGCATCAT-3′, FGFR4: sense, 5′-CTGTTGAGCATCTTTCAGGG-3′; antisense, 5′-CGTGGAAGGCCTGTCCATCC-3′. PCR consisted of 40 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 45 s, annealing at 53 °C for 45 s, and extension at 72 °C for 120 s. The PCR products for FGFR1, 2, 3, and 4 were 856, 373, 635, and 550 bp, respectively. Mouse osteoclasts and osteoblasts were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed with TNE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mmNaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4, 1 mmaminoethyl-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). The protein concentration in the cell lysate was measured using a Protein Assay Kit II (Bio-Rad). Immunoprecipitation was performed using antibodies either noncovalently bound or conjugated to protein G-Sepharose (Life Technologies, Inc.). Equivalent amounts (100 μg) of cell lysates were incubated with coupled antibody for 4 h at 4 °C, and the beads were washed three times with a lysis buffer and boiled in 3× Laemmli sample buffer before electrophoresis. Each immunoprecipitant was electrophoresed by 8% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. After blockage of nonspecific binding with 5% skim milk, membranes were incubated with polyclonal anti-mouse FGFR1, 2, 3, and 4 or nonimmune IgG. Immunoreactive bands were stained using the ECL chemiluminescence reaction (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) following the manufacturer's instructions. After this visualizing, the antibodies on the membrane were stripped in a buffer consisting of 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.7), 2% SDS, and 100 mm2-mercaptoethanol at 50 °C for 40 min. To ascertain the specificity of these blots, the stripping membrane was further immunoreacted with each polyclonal anti-FGFR and respective blocking peptide, and the immunoreactive bands were again visualized under the same conditions as above. The immunoreactivity to each anti-FGFR was not lost by this stripping procedure. Osteoblastic cells and bone marrow cells were co-cultured on 100-mm tissue culture dishes in αMEM containing 10% FBS and 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D3 (10−8m) for 6 days, with a medium change at 2 days, and then for 1 more day in αMEM/0.1% FBS. After mouse and rabbit osteoclasts were isolated as described above, they were precultured for 2 h with αMEM/0.1% FBS and treated with FGF-2 (10−12m) for various periods (2–30 min). The cells were quickly washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed with TNE buffer. Cell lysates containing equal amounts of protein (10 μg) were subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE, and proteins separated in the gel were subsequently electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. After blocking with 5% bovine serum albumin, the membranes with mouse osteoclast lysates were incubated with polyclonal rabbit antibody against phosphotyrosine (UBI, Lake Placid, NY) and subsequently with peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody. Phosphotyrosine-containing proteins were visualized using the ECL chemiluminescence reaction following the manufacture's instructions. After the antibody was stripped from the membrane, to block nonspecific binding, membranes were incubated with 5% skim milk and then with monoclonal mouse antibody against p60v-src, polyclonal rabbit antibodies against phospho-p44/42 MAP kinase, -JNK, and -p38 MAP kinase, and the immunoreactive bands were visualized as described above. Isolated mouse osteoclasts were incubated with and without FGF-2 (10−12m) for various periods (1–10 min). The cells were quickly washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed with TNE buffer, and equal amounts of protein (100 μg) were immunoprecipitated with 1 μg of polyclonal rabbit anti-FGFR1. The immune complex was washed three times with TNE buffer and three times with kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.4), and 10 mm MgCl2); the samples were then resuspended in 60 μl of kinase buffer with 1 μCi (37 kBq) of [γ-32P]ATP and incubated for 15 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 20 μl of 4× sample buffer (250 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 8 mm EDTA, 12% SDS, 500 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 15% glycerol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue) and subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions followed by autoradiography. Means of groups were compared by ANOVA and significance of differences was determined by post-hoc testing using Bonferroni's method. To examine the direct action of FGF-2 on osteoclasts, the effect of FGF-2 on resorbed pit formation on a dentine slice by purified osteoclasts was compared with that by unfractionated bone cells from rabbit long bones (Fig. 1). FGF-2 at 10−12–10−8m stimulated resorbed pit formation by isolated mature osteoclasts with a maximal effect of 1.9-fold at 10−11m, and no further stimulations were observed at higher concentrations (Fig.1 A). This stimulation was not due to the increase in the number of osteoclasts but to the activation of each osteoclast function, because the area of each pit (the total pit area per number of pits) was similarly increased by FGF-2 (≥10−12m, data not shown). Because previous reports have shown that the bone resorptive effect of FGF-2 is mediated at least in part by COX-2 induction in osteoblastic cells (18Hurley M.M. Lee S.K. Raisz L.G. Bernecker P. Lorenzo J. Bone. 1998; 22: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 20Kawaguchi H. Pilbeam C.C. Gronowicz G. Abreu C. Fletcher B.S. Herschman H.R. Raisz L.G. Hurley M.M. J. Clin.

Res. 2000; 15: 466-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), the contribution of COX-2 to the direct action was examined by adding NS-398 (1 μm), a specific inhibitor of COX-2, to the culture of isolated osteoclasts. NS-398 did not alter the FGF-2 action on isolated osteoclasts, indicating that the direct action is not mediated by COX-2 induction or by PG production (Fig. 1 A). On the other hand, FGF-2 at 10−9 and 10−8m further stimulated resorbed pit formation by unfractionated bone cells up to 7.5-fold (Fig. 1 B). This stimulatory effect of high concentrations of FGF-2 on pit formation by unfractionated bone cells was 70–80% inhibited by NS-398. Because we have previously shown that COX-2 is expressed in cells of osteoblastic lineage but not in cells of osteoclastic lineage (22Kawaguchi H. Chikazu D. Nakamura K. Kumegawa M. Hakeda Y. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 466-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), the target cells of FGF-2 to induce COX-2 are those of osteoblastic lineage as reported previously (20Kawaguchi H.

Res. 2000; 15: 466-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and suggest that FGF-2 at low concentrations (≥10−12m) moderately stimulates bone resorption through its direct action on osteoclasts, whereas at high concentrations (≥10−9m) it potently stimulates bone resorption through its indirect action mediated by COX-2 induction in osteoblastic cells. Because mouse osteoclasts do not have enough potency to resorb bone after being isolated, functional analysis was carried out by measuring mRNA levels of proteinases, which have been reported to be produced by osteoclasts (Fig.2, upper panel). Cathepsin K is an osteoclast-selective cysteine proteinase that plays a key role in matrix degradation during bone resorption (34Tezuka K. Tezuka Y. Maejima A. Sato T. Nemoto K. Kamioka H. Hakeda Y.

Northern blot analysis of the dose response of FGF-2 revealed that at 10−12–10−8m it stimulated steady-state mRNA levels of cathepsin K and MMP-9, but not that of MMP-14, at 3 h of culture. Similar regulation of cathepsin K and MMP-9 mRNA levels were seen in isolated rabbit osteoclasts, although FGF-2 effects were not as strong as those on mouse osteoclasts (Fig. 2, lower panel).

https://openalex.org/W2029084182,"We previously identified a novel murine protein, AND-34, with a carboxyl-terminal domain homologous to Ras family guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), which bound to the focal adhesion docking protein p130Cas. Work by others has implicated both the human homologue of AND-34, BCAR3, and human p130Cas, BCAR1, in the resistance of breast cancer cells to the anti-estrogen tamoxifen. Here we report that AND-34 displays GEF activity on RalA, Rap1A, and R-Ras but not Ha-Ras GTPases in cells. In contrast to several other Ral-GEFs, the Ral GEF activity of AND-34 is not augmented by constitutively active Ha-RasVal-12, consistent with the absence of a detectable Ras-binding domain. Efficient binding to AND-34 required both the Src-binding domain and a flanking carboxyl-terminal region of p130Cas. The p130Cas-binding site mapped to a carboxyl-terminal sequence within the AND-34 GEF domain. Overexpression of p130Cas, but not an AND-34-binding mutant of p130Cas, inhibited the Ral GEF activity of co-transfected AND-34. This work identifies a new potential function for p130Cas and a new regulatory pathway involved in the control of Ral, Rap, and R-Ras GTPases that may participate in the progression of breast cancer cells to tamoxifen resistance.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6776-6782Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). The superfamily can be divided into many subfamilies including Ras, Rho, Rap, Arf, and Ran. All members of the superfamily cycle between inactive GDP-bound and active GTP-bound states. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs)1 with specificity for different Ras family members induce the dissociation of GDP, allowing the more abundant GTP to bind and activate these GTPases. In an effort to identify genes transcriptionally up-regulated following the induction of thymocyte apoptosis by cross-linking CD3ε in vivo, we recently cloned a novel murine cDNA, AND-34, which contains a carboxyl-terminal domain similar to GEFs for one or more GTPases of the Ras subfamily of GTPases, including Ras, Ral, Rap, R-Ras, and TC21 (2Cai D. Clayton L.K. Smolyar A. Lerner A. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 2104-2112PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to previously reported Ras subfamily GEFs, AND-34 contained an SH2 domain at its amino terminus. We also observed that AND-34 forms a complex in cells with p130Cas, a known c-Src substrate and a docking protein that binds to the Crk adaptor protein, focal adhesion kinase, PYK2/RAFTK tyrosine kinases, and PTP-PEST or PTP1B phosphatases (3Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Consistent with such interactions, AND-34 undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation following adhesion of trypsinized fibroblasts to fibronectin-coated plates (2Cai D. Clayton L.K. Smolyar A. Lerner A. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 2104-2112PubMed Google Scholar). AND-34 is the murine homologue of NSP-2, a cDNA characterized as one of three closely related family members referred to as NSP1, NSP-2, and NSP-3 (4Lu Y. Brush J. Stewart T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10047-10052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). NSP-1 was also shown to be tyrosine-phosphorylated following treatment of cells with EGF or insulin. The human homologue of AND-34 was detected in a study designed to detect cDNAs whose expression converts tamoxifen-sensitive breast cancer cells to tamoxifen insensitivity (5van Agthoven T. van Agthoven T. Dekker A. Spek P. Vreede L. Dorssers L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2799-2808Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Remarkably, the same screen has also recently detected p130Cas (6Brinkman A. van der Flier S. Kok E.M. Dorssers L.C.J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 112-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), adding support to the notion that p130Cas and AND-34 function in a common signaling pathway to regulate hormone-dependent proliferation of breast cancer cells. Additional support for the relevance of these findings is that AND-34 expression correlates with loss of estrogen receptors in breast cancer cell lines (5van Agthoven T. van Agthoven T. Dekker A. Spek P. Vreede L. Dorssers L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2799-2808Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Furthermore, high levels of p130Cas in primary human breast carcinomas are associated with poor relapse-free survival, poor overall survival, and a reduced response rate to tamoxifen in patients with recurrent disease (7Van der Flier S. Brinkman A. Look M.P. Kok E.M. Gelder M.E. Klijn J. Dorssers L. Foekens J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 120-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In the study described below, we have shown that AND-34 is an activator of Ral and to a lesser extent R-Ras and Rap1A GTPases. Our mapping studies and our in vivo GDP exchange assays suggest that p130Cas inhibits the GEF activity of AND-34. HEK293 human embryonic kidney cells, a gift from Dr. Barbara Slack (Boston University School of Medicine) (8Graham F.L. Smiley J. Russell W.C. Nairn R. J. Gen. Virol. 1977; 36: 59-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (3512) Google Scholar), were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 μm 2-mercaptoethanol. 293 cells were trypsinized 1 day prior to transfection and transferred to 6-well (35 mm) plates. Cells were 80% confluent on the day of transfection. For each well of the plate, 2.5 μg of plasmid DNA was mixed with 5 μl of DNA PLUS reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 125 μl of serum-free DMEM at room temperature for 15 min. 7.5 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 125 μl of serum-free DMEM was then added for a further 15 min. The 250-μl final mixture was then added evenly to cells covered with 0.6 ml of fresh DMEM with 10% FBS and incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2, for 3 h. One ml of DMEM with 10% FBS was then added to each well. 24 h after transfection, cells were washed with PBS and lysed in ice for 1 h with 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mmEGTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin). The protein supernatant was collected after centrifugation at 14,000 rpm (relative centrifugal force = 16,000) at 4 °C for 10 min. 0.5 mg of protein was mixed with the primary antibody for 2 h at 4 °C. 25 μl of protein A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with 1 ml of lysis buffer, and protein was released from beads by boiling them with 20 μl of 2× sample buffer for 5 min. The supernatant was run on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and the immunoblot was developed by ECL as described previously (2Cai D. Clayton L.K. Smolyar A. Lerner A. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 2104-2112PubMed Google Scholar). Cos7 cells (5 × 105 per 60-mm dish on the day prior to transfection) were transfected by the DEAE-dextran method with expression vectors containing GST-GTPases, GEFs, and/or full-length or SBD-deleted p130Cas, as described in the figure legends. 48 h later, cells were labeled for 4 h in phosphate and serum-free media with 0.05 mCi/ml of 32Pi (ICN). GST-fused GTPases were collected by incubation of cell lysates with glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) for 1 h and washed with lysis buffer. GTPase-bound 32P-labeled guanine nucleotides were separated by thin layer chromatography (Andrich) and quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics) as described previously (9Urano T. Emkey R. Feig L.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 810-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). The data are presented as a ratio of GTP/(GDP + GTP). NH2-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged deletion mutants of AND-34 were constructed utilizing a pcDNA1 vector in which a Kozak consensus sequence, a start codon, and a 12-amino acid HA-epitope were cloned 5′ of a BamHI site (10Ginsberg D. Vairo G. Chittenden T. Xiao Z.-X. Xu G. Wydner K.L. DeCaprio J.A. Lawrence J.B. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2665-2679Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Contiguous AND-34 sequences were amplified from the 34-1 cDNA by PCR with Deep Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) using oligonucleotide sequences derived from the AND-34 open reading frame with flanking BclI sites (5′ oligonucleotide) and stop codon/XbaI sites (3′ oligonucleotide). The 5′ ΔSH2 oligonucleotide sequence was derived from AND-34 bp 1130–1149, 5′ ΔSH2/Pro from bp 1617–1638, and 5′ GEF from bp 1975–1995. The 3′ SH2 oligonucleotides were antisense to AND-34 bp 1149–1130, 3′ SH2/Pro antisense to bp 1638–1617, and 3′ ΔGEF antisense to bp 1971–1949.BclI/XbaI-digested PCR products were ligated to BamHI/XbaI-digested vector. The p130Cas deletion mutants ΔSH3, ΔSB, and ΔSBD, and the p130Cas SBD point mutants RPLP and Y762F were generously provided by Dr. Tetsuya Nakamoto and Dr. Hisamaru Hirai (University of Tokyo) and have been described previously (11Nakamoto T. Sakai R. Ozawa K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8959-8965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Four hemagglutinin epitope-tagged p130Cas Src-binding domain mutants were constructed using an identical cloning strategy to that described above for the AND-34 mutants, with the exception that the 5′ oligonucleotides contained a flanking BamHI site. Two 5′ oligonucleotides, 5PSBD-L and 5PSBD-S, contained 21 nucleotides distal to nucleotides 1693 and 1947 (residues 553 and 638), respectively, of rat p130Cas (GenBankTMaccession number D29766). The two 3′ oligonucleotides, 3PSBD-L and 3PSBD-S, contained the inverse complement of 21 nucleotides proximal to nucleotides 2920 and 2706 (residues 968 and 890), respectively, of p130Cas. Sequence encoding a core 253-residue region (residues 638–890) previously shown to be required for Src binding to p130Cas was amplified with 5PSBD-S and 3PSBD-S oligonucleotides and subcloned to generate SBD-Core (predicted size 27.9 kDa) (11Nakamoto T. Sakai R. Ozawa K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8959-8965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). A 415-residue sequence encoding 84 residues NH2-terminal and 78 residues COOH-terminal to the core SBD region was amplified with 5PSBD-L and 3PSBD-L and subcloned to generate SBD-Long (residues 553–968, predicted size = 46.8 kDa). Two additional sequences corresponding to the core SBD combined with either flanking NH2-terminal (NH2-SBD) or COOH-terminal (SBD-COOH) sequence were also amplified and subcloned using the oligonucleotides described above (predicted sizes of 38.4 and 37.8 kDa, respectively). Full-length AND-34 was amplified by PCR with Deep Vent DNA polymerase using oligonucleotides with flanking XhoI (5′ oligonucleotide) and EcoRI (3′ oligonucleotide) restriction sites.XhoI/EcoRI-digested PCR product was ligated to similarly digested pcDNA3.1/Myc-His B vector (Invitrogen). Myc-tagged AND-34 deletion mutants were similarly cloned using the same oligonucleotide sequences described for the HA-tagged mutants. The existence of a CDC25-like domain at the COOH terminus of AND-34 suggested that the protein had GEF activity against members of the Ras subfamily of Ras superfamily GTPases. The ability of AND-34 to promote the active GTP-bound state of a variety of Ras subfamily members in cells, including RasH, Rap1A, R-Ras, and RalA was tested by co-transfection of individual GST-GTPase fusion constructs along with AND-34 into Cos cells. After labeling cells with 32P, the proportion of GTPase associated with GTP in cells was assessed by isolation of the GTPase on glutathione beads and quantitation of bound nucleotides by thin layer chromatography. In these assays, AND-34 increased the proportion of GTP RalA in cells from ∼15% GTP to 30% GTP. In comparison, transfection of the same amount of DNA encoding Ral-GDS, a known GEF for Ral, elevated Ral-GTP levels to only ∼22% (Fig. 1 A). AND-34 was less effective at activating R-Ras, elevating its GTP levels from ∼15 to ∼23% (Fig. 1 B). AND-34 was not as effective as Ras-GRF1, a known R-Ras GEF, which increased R-Ras GTP levels to ∼29%. AND-34 also elevated Rap1A GTP levels from 5% GTP to ∼11% GTP. It was not as effective as the known Rap1A GEF, C3G, which increased Rap-GTP levels to 22% (Fig. 1 C). In contrast to RalA, R-Ras, and Rap1A, RasH was unresponsive to AND-34 expression even though RasH did become activated by the known Ras GEF, SOS, under the same conditions (Fig. 1 D). Thus, AND-34 appears to be a multifunctional GEF with the ability to activate RalA, R-Ras, and Rap1A but not Ha-Ras. Most fully characterized Ral-GEFs isolated to date have a Ras-binding domain that allows them to become activated by GTP-Ras. However, inspection of the amino acid sequence of AND-34 failed to reveal such a binding site. As expected, co-transfection of a constitutively activated Ras did not increase the GEF activity of AND-34 GEF as it did for Ral-GDS which contains a Ras-binding site. Interestingly, for reasons that are not yet clear, activated Ras appeared to decrease the activity of AND-34. We have previously shown that AND-34 associates with p130Cas, a focal adhesion docking protein (2Cai D. Clayton L.K. Smolyar A. Lerner A. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 2104-2112PubMed Google Scholar, 12Kirsch K.H. Georgescu M.-M. Hanafusa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25673-25679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In order to map the site of interaction between these two proteins, we constructed a series of NH2-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged deletion mutants of AND-34 (Fig.2). After transient expression of the mutants in HEK293 cells, anti-HA immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with anti-p130Cas antibody to detect complexes with endogenous p130Cas. Deletion of the SH2 domain (ΔSH2) and proline-rich domain (ΔSH2/Pro) did not significantly reduce binding of AND-34 to p130Cas (Fig.3). This result was surprising as the polyproline-rich region of AND-34 contains a motif that matched a consensus site (XPp+P) for binding to the SH3 domain of p130Cas (2Cai D. Clayton L.K. Smolyar A. Lerner A. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 2104-2112PubMed Google Scholar).Figure 3Identification of the region of AND-34 required for association with p130Cas in cells. Upper panel, immunoblot analysis with anti-HA antibodies of whole cell lysates of 293 cells transfected with HA-tagged AND-34 truncation mutants (see Fig. 1 for structure of mutants). The lower bands in the SH2 and SH2/Pro mutant lanes may represent degradation products. Lower panel, the whole cell lysates analyzed in the upper panel were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibodies, followed by immunoblot analysis with anti-p130Cas antibodies. The band migrating at 135 kDa in the last three lanes is p130Cas.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In contrast, each of four constructs lacking the GEF domain (SH2, SH2/Pro, ΔGEF, and ΔSH2/GEF) failed to associate with p130Cas (Fig. 3). Immunoblots with anti-HA antibody of the corresponding whole cell lysates demonstrated that the HA-tagged truncation mutants were of appropriate size and were expressed with comparable efficiency (Fig. 3). To delineate further the region of AND-34 responsible for binding to p130Cas, we utilized the ΔSH2 mutant to construct three further mutants in which 70, 140, or 210 amino acid portions of the GEF domain were removed from the carboxyl terminus of AND-34 (Fig. 2,ΔSH2/GEF750, -680, or -610, respectively). In contrast to wild type AND-34, none of the proteins expressed by these constructs bound to p130Cas, suggesting that at least the terminal 70 amino acids of the AND-34 GEF domain are required for this interaction (Fig.4). However, an AND-34 mutant containing solely the GEF domain failed to bind to p130Cas (Fig. 4) in cells. To confirm these findings, we synthesized an independent set of deletion mutants in which the Myc epitope tag was placed on the AND-34 carboxyl terminus (nomenclature identical to that of HA-tagged mutants). Once again, immunoprecipitation of three AND-34 mutants (SH2, SH2/Pro, and ΔSH2/GEF) that lacked the GEF domain failed to associate with p130Cas in these assays (data not shown). In aggregate, these experiments demonstrate that the minimum domain required for AND-34 association with p130Cas in cells includes the GEF domain and at least 70 amino acids amino-terminal to it. In order to identify the region of p130Casrequired for association with AND-34, we transiently co-transfected a full-length Myc-tagged AND-34 construct in HEK293 cells with HA-tagged deletion mutants of p130Cas (see Fig.5) (11Nakamoto T. Sakai R. Ozawa K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8959-8965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Deletion of the SH3 domain (ΔSH3) failed to significantly reduce association of p130Cas with AND-34 (Fig. 6). This finding is consistent with the AND-34 deletion analysis, which showed that its proline-rich region was not needed for binding to p130Cas. Deletion of the substrate domain (ΔSD) of p130Cas also failed to significantly reduce association of p130Cas with AND-34 (Fig. 6). In contrast, deletion of the 253-residue Src-binding domain (ΔSBD) eliminated the association of these two proteins (Fig. 6). Mutation of either an RPLP sequence or Tyr-762 within the p130Cas SBD, both of which have previously been shown to reduce the association of p130Caswith Src (11Nakamoto T. Sakai R. Ozawa K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8959-8965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), failed to abrogate binding of AND-34 to p130Cas (Fig. 6, RPLP and Y762F). Thus, although the ΔSBD failed to bind AND-34, Src itself did not tether AND-34 to p130Cas.Figure 6Mapping of the AND-34 binding site on p130Cas. Upper panel, Myc epitope-tagged AND-34 was transfected into HEK293 cells in conjunction with either full-length or truncated forms of HA epitope-tagged forms of p130Cas. After immunoprecipitation with anti-myc antibody, immunoblots were probed for HA-p130Cas. Middleand lower panel, immunoblotting of whole cell lysates demonstrates comparable expression levels of Myc-tagged AND-34 and HA-tagged p130Cas, with the exception of reduced expression of HA-ΔSH3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To delineate better the AND-34-binding site on p130Cas, we constructed four HA epitope-tagged forms of the SBD. SBD-Core consisted of a 253-residue peptide (638–890, numbering according to Sakai et al. (3Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar, 11Nakamoto T. Sakai R. Ozawa K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8959-8965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar)) corresponding precisely to the region deleted in ΔSBD (see Fig. 5). As shown in the top and middle panels of Fig. 7, immunoprecipitates of either Myc-tagged AND-34 or HA-tagged-SBD failed to demonstrate association of these two proteins. Whole cell lysates showed expression of the appropriate 27-kDa HA-tagged peptide (Fig. 7,lower panel). Thus, whereas the SBD region is necessary for p130Cas to bind to AND-34, it is not sufficient for such binding. Three additional HA epitope-tagged constructs were tested to assess whether 84 NH2-terminal residues or COOH-terminal 78 residues flanking the p130Cas SBD contribute to AND-34 binding. Although all three of these constructs were expressed well in transfected 293 cells, only the constructs containing COOH-terminal flanking sequences along with the SBD-Core efficiently bound to AND-34 (see SBD-Long and COOH-SBD versus SBD-NH2 in Fig. 7). The surprising observation that AND-34 requires its GEF domain for p130Cas binding suggests that such binding modulates AND-34 GEF activity. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of overexpression of p130Cas on the Ral GEF activity of AND-34 by the previously described in vivoGEF assay (Fig. 8). Transfection of full-length p130Cas blocked the ability of AND-34 to promote Ral-GTP levels in cells. Importantly, overexpression of ΔSBD- p130Cas, which we previously demonstrated fails to bind AND-34, had no effect on AND-34-induced Ral GEF activity. The effect of p130Cas was due to a change in the GEF activity of AND-34 since neither p130Cas nor its AND-34-binding mutant had any effect on Ral GTP levels when AND-34 was not co-transfected (Fig. 8). Immunoblots show that p130Cas had no detectable effect on the expression level of AND-34. These results suggest that p130Cas is a negative regulator of AND-34 GEF activity. In this work, we have identified AND-34 as a novel GDP exchange factor with activity in vivo on RalA, Rap1A, and R-Ras GTPases. The spectrum of GTPases activated by AND-34 is somewhat unusual. Previously identified Ral-GEFs have not been demonstrated to have multiple targets. Moreover, Rap and R-Ras are activated by C3G, and Ras and R-Ras are activated by Ras-GRF1, but no GEF identified to date has been able to activate all three (13Gotoh T. Hattori S. Nakamura S.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12609-12613Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Our experiments suggest that AND-34 is most effective against RalA, although this conclusion is not firm since the conditions used involved overexpression of both exchange factor and GTPase. Whether the differences in exchange activity observed reflect properties intrinsic to AND-34 or the contribution of additional cellular components remains to be established. For example, the efficiency with which endogenous AND-34 interacts with these GTPases in cells could be affected dramatically by interacting proteins or by the subcellular localization of the endogenous GEF and GTPases. It is also likely that the AND-34 signaling specificity may vary with cell type and with the mechanism by which AND-34 is activated. All of these issues are clearly worthy of study in the future. AND-34 is the murine homologue of the human protein, NSP2, one of three structurally related proteins termed NSP1-NSP3 by Lu and colleagues (4Lu Y. Brush J. Stewart T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10047-10052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). SHEP1 (NSP3) was shown to bind to R-Ras and Rap1A but not RasH or RalA (16Dodelet V.C. Pazzagli C. Zisch A.H. Hauser C.A. Pasquale E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31941-31946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). However, its isolated CDC25 domain failed to promote nucleotide exchange on any GTPases in vitro. It is likely that AND-34 is one of a family of GEFs that are regulated by similar upstream signals but activate different sets of GTPases. A further unusual feature of AND-34 is that, unlike most Ral-GEFs reported on to date, it does not have a detectable Ras-binding site, and its activity is not enhanced by co-expression with activated Ras. In this respect, AND-34 resembles Ral-GPS, a recently described Ral-GEF family that contains a pleckstrin homology domain but no Ras-binding site (17Rebhun J.F. Chen H. Quilliam L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13406-13410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we actually observed an inhibitory effect of Ras expression on AND-34. Presumably this is through an indirect mechanism mediated by some Ras effector system, possibly as part of a negative regulatory network. AND-34 and other NSP family members have amino-terminal SH2 domains suggesting that they can be modulated by tyrosine kinase signaling. In fact, EGF and insulin promote the tyrosine phosphorylation of NSP1, whereas integrins promote the tyrosine phosphorylation of NSP1 and AND-34 (2Cai D. Clayton L.K. Smolyar A. Lerner A. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 2104-2112PubMed Google Scholar, 4Lu Y. Brush J. Stewart T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10047-10052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In addition, the SH2 domain of murine NSP3, SHEP1, binds to a phosphorylated tyrosine motif in the juxtamembrane region of the EphB2 receptor, and NSP-3 is heavily tyrosine-phosphorylated in cells expressing activated EphB2 (4Lu Y. Brush J. Stewart T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10047-10052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 16Dodelet V.C. Pazzagli C. Zisch A.H. Hauser C.A. Pasquale E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31941-31946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Whether such signals change the GEF activity of AND-34 remains to be determined. Another common feature of some members of this class of proteins is their ability to bind to the c-Src substrate and adaptor protein p130Cas. When we set out to map the domains responsible for the interaction of AND-34 to p130Cas, we suspected that it might be through the SH3 domain of p130Cas, as AND-34 contains a polyproline-rich domain. This region includes the conserved motif XPp+P, a motif previously determined to mediate the association of PTP-PEST, PTP1B, focal adhesion kinase, and C3G with the p130Cas SH3 domain (2Cai D. Clayton L.K. Smolyar A. Lerner A. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 2104-2112PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, it was plausible that the amino-terminal SH2 domain of AND-34 bound to the p130Cas substrate domain, a region containing nine YD XP sites that are close to the binding motif of the SH2 domain of v-Crk (3Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). To our surprise, the AND-34 SH2 domain and the proline-rich region were expendable for binding to p130Cas, whereas the carboxyl terminus containing the GEF domain was not. In fact the nature of the binding between the two proteins may be rather complex, since binding required the entire GEF catalytic domain as well as additional amino-terminal sequence. Although our data do not rule out the possibility that AND-34 binds to p130Cas through an intermediary protein, a recent report demonstrating that murine NSP-3 binds directly to the COOH terminus of p130Cas suggests that this is unlikely (18Sakakibara A. Hattori S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6404-6410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Along the same lines, our studies also show that AND-34 binds to the COOH terminus of p130Cas, a region encompassing its Src-binding domain (SBD) and flanking COOH-terminal sequences but not its SH3 domain. The fact that p130Cas binds to a region encompassing the GEF domain of AND-34 motivated us to test whether its binding influences AND-34 GEF activity. When p130Cas was co-expressed with AND-34, we did in fact detect a significant decrease in the ability of the exchange factor to activate Ral in cells. This effect was likely due to the binding between the two proteins since a p130Cas mutant that did not bind to AND-34 under the same co-transfection conditions failed to suppress its GEF activity. This finding suggests that AND-34 is under negative regulatory control by p130Cas binding, possibly by steric hindrance of GTPase binding to the catalytic domain. Alternatively, p130Cascould target AND-34 to a location in the cell where it does not have access to its GTPase substrates. It should be noted, however, that in some reports, docking or scaffolding proteins that have first been detected as inhibitors of their binding partners subsequently were shown to function in a positive fashion (19Burack W.R. Shaw A.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Thus, p130Cascould conceivably normally function to influence the specificity of AND-34 signaling rather than as a regulator of its catalytic activity. AND-34 is the murine homologue of human BCAR3, a gene cloned on the basis of its ability to convert tamoxifen-sensitive breast cancer cell lines to tamoxifen resistance (5van Agthoven T. van Agthoven T. Dekker A. Spek P. Vreede L. Dorssers L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2799-2808Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). This finding implies that signal transduction pathways altered by AND-34 overexpression mediate at least some aspects of this process. Many metastatic estrogen receptor-positive breast cancers are treatable with anti-estrogens such as tamoxifen, perhaps because cell proliferation or survival remains dependent upon estrogen. However, such tumors usually progress to a tamoxifen-resistant (estrogen-independent) state. Unfortunately, little is known about the molecular basis for the development of resistance to tamoxifen therapy. If the model system used to detect BCAR3 (AND-34) is reflective of the development of tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer patients then an understanding of the mechanism of AND-34 (BCAR3) action in this system may be quite important. The identifiable domains in AND-34 suggest at least four mechanisms of action could be involved, via the amino-terminal SH2 domain, the proline-rich region, the p130Cas-binding site, and/or the GEF domain. In this paper we show that the GEF domain can potentially activate RalA, Rap1A, and R-Ras GTPases. Thus, signaling pathways downstream of these GTPases are potential mediators. For example, Ral GTPases are known to interact with multiple signaling molecules including RalBP1, a GTPase-activating protein for Rac and CDC42 GTPases; filamin, an actin-binding protein; and phospholipase D (20Ohta Y.

Urano T. Frankel P. Lu Z. Foster D.A. Feig L.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 409-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Of particular interest is our recent discovery that Ral GTPases mediate EGF activation of c-Src (25Goi T. Shipitsin M. Lu Z. Foster D.A. Klinz S.G. Feig L.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Elevated levels of EGF receptor family members and c-Src activity are commonly found in breast cancer samples (26Biscardi J.S. Tice D.A. Parsons S.J. Adv. Cancer Res. 1999; 76: 61-119Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, expression of EGF receptor is associated with a lack of response to hormonal therapy in patients with recurrent breast cancer (27Nicholson S. Sainsbury J.R. Halcrow P. Chambers P. Farndon J.R. Harris A.L. Lancet. 1989; 1: 182-185Abstract PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Rap GTPases can activate B-Raf and mediate ligand-induced cell adhesion, whereas R-Ras can activate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and influence inside-out integrin signaling and apoptosis (28Ohtsuka T. Shimuzu K. Yamamori B. Kuroda S. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1258-1261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 29Keely P.J. Rusyn E.V. Cox A.D. Parise L.V. J.

R-Ras has also been shown to promote invasion of breast cancer cells (29Keely P.J. Rusyn E.V. Cox A.D. Parise L.V. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1077-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Which, if any, of these signaling pathways mediate AND-34 action are presently under investigation. Remarkably, the same screen that detected BCAR3 (AND-34) as an inducer of tamoxifen resistance also recently found human p130Cas(6Brinkman A. van der Flier S. Kok E.M. Dorssers L.C.J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 112-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The fact that a random screen of genes detected two cDNAs that code for proteins that naturally bind to each other in cells argues strongly that the signaling pathways affected by these two proteins are particularly potent in promoting tamoxifen resistance, at least in breast cancer cell lines. The suggestion that p130Casexpression may influence human breast cancer biology is supported by the finding that patients with breast tumors expressing a high level of p130Cas appear to experience more rapid disease recurrence and are more resistant to tamoxifen therapy (7Van der Flier S. Brinkman A. Look M.P. Kok E.M. Gelder M.E. Klijn J. Dorssers L. Foekens J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 120-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Our finding that overexpression of p130Cas suppresses the GEF activity of AND-34 suggests that AND-34 functions through p130Cas in the induction of tamoxifen resistance, rather than p130Cas functioning through the GEF activity of AND-34. However, as described above, it is not clear that the natural function of p130Cas is to suppress AND-34 GEF activity and so firm conclusions must await additional experiments. It is possible, for instance, that both p130Cas and the GEF domain of AND-34 activate common signaling pathways when overexpressed. One obvious set of candidates are c-Src mediated events, because as we recently showed, Ral-GEFs can activate c-Src in cells and p130Cas has been shown to participate in c-Src signaling (25Goi T. Shipitsin M. Lu Z. Foster D.A. Klinz S.G. Feig L.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 32Hakak Y. Martin G.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6953-6962Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In conclusion, we have identified a new GEF with novel signaling specificity. It can potentially activate multiple members of the Ras subfamily of GTPases, Ral, R-Ras and Rap. It also appears to be regulated by a well characterized adaptor protein, p130Cas. Finally, understanding the interrelationships between AND-34 and p130Cas may reveal important insights into human oncogenesis.

Although the loss of α-catenin expression can also promote cell growth, the role of endogenous α-catenin in β-catenin signaling is unclear. Here we show that loss of α-catenin expression in a colon cancer cell line correlates with increased Tcf-dependent transcription. The presence of α-catenin in colon cancer cell nuclei suggests that it inhibits transcription directly, and, in agreement with this, ectopic expression of α-catenin in the nucleus represses Tcf-dependent transcription. Furthermore, recombinant α-catenin disrupts the interaction between the β-catenin·Tcf complex and DNA.

T-cell factor lymphoid enhancer factor adenomatous polyposis coli green fluorescent protein nuclear localization signal glutathione S-transferase Rous sarcoma virus phosphate-buffered saline β-Catenin has two separable functions; it is a component of the Wnt signal transduction pathway that results in axis formation and cell fate choice during embryonic development (1.Wodarz A. Nusse R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 59-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar, 2.Eastman Q. Grosschedl R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar), and it is part of the cadherin cell adhesion complex (3.Provost E. Rimm D.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 567-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The central armadillo repeat domain of β-catenin is necessary for both of these functions, because it directly binds Tcf/LEF-11family transcription factors to transduce Wnt signals and cadherins to promote cell-cell adhesion.In the current model of the Wnt signaling pathway, the cytosolic level of β-catenin is controlled by phosphorylation and ubiquitin-dependent degradation. Wnt signals stabilize β-catenin, allowing it to associate with Tcf/LEF-1 family members and enter the nucleus to regulate gene expression. β-Catenin can also enter the nucleus independently, in a manner similar to that of the nuclear transport protein importin-β (4.Fagotto F. Gluck U. Gumbiner B.M. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 181-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Yokoya F. Imamoto N. Tachibana T. Yoneda Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1119-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), suggesting that β-catenin may be a specific importin for other proteins. Support for this comes from studies of Armadillo (the Drosophilahomologue of β-catenin), which co-imports the transcription factor Teashirt into the nucleus (6.Gallet A. Angelats C. Erkner A. Charroux B. Fasano L. Kerridge S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2208-2217Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Several tumor types harbor mutations in the genes encoding the tumor suppressor APC or β-catenin. These mutations result in permanent activation of Wnt target genes because the β-catenin·Tcf complex is no longer regulated by degradation of β-catenin (7.Morin P.J. Sparks A.B. Korinek V. Barker N.

A. 1997; 94: 10330-10334Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Importantly, proteins that are not involved in β-catenin stability can also regulate β-catenin signaling. NEMO-like kinase, for example, inhibits the interaction between the β-catenin·Tcf complex and DNA by phosphorylating Tcf/LEF proteins (10.Ishitani T. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Nagai S. Nishita M. Meneghini M. Barker N. Waterman M. Bowerman B. Clevers H. Shibuya H. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 399: 798-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar).α-Catenin is another protein that can inhibit β-catenin signaling independently of stabilizing mutations in β-catenin or APC (11.Simcha I.

Cell Res. 2000; 255: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). α-Catenin associates directly with β-catenin (13.Aberle H. Butz S. Stappert J. Weissig H. Kemler R. Hoschuetzky H. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3655-3663Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Jou T.S. Stewart D.B. Stappert J. Nelson W.J. Marrs J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5067-5071Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), linking cadherins to the actin cytoskeleton, an interaction that is essential for strong cell-cell adhesion (15.Hirano S. Kimoto N.

Kemler R. Gruss P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 901-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The expression of α-catenin is often reduced during tumor progression (17.Hirohashi S. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 153: 333-339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar), and several cancer-derived cell lines have mutations in the α-catenin gene (18.Watabe M. Nagafuchi A. Tsukita S. Takeichi M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar,19.Bullions L.C. Notterman D.A. Chung L.S. Levine A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4501-4508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reintroduction of α-catenin into such lines reduces cell growth (18.Watabe M. Nagafuchi A. Tsukita S. Takeichi M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar) and attenuates tumor formation (19.Bullions L.C. Notterman D.A. Chung L.S. Levine A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4501-4508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the tumor suppressor function of α-catenin is generally believed to result from its promotion of cell-cell adhesion, the possibility that α-catenin influences tumor progression by regulating β-catenin signaling has not been investigated.We examined β-catenin signaling in colon cancer cell lines and found that loss of α-catenin expression correlated with increased β-catenin·Tcf-dependent transcription. Furthermore, α-catenin was found in cell nuclei, suggesting a role in processes other than cell adhesion. In support of this possibility, ectopic expression of α-catenin in the nucleus inhibited β-catenin·Tcf signaling, and α-catenin disrupted the interaction between the β-catenin·Tcf complex and DNA in vitro.DISCUSSIONThe tumor suppressor function of α-catenin is generally believed to result from its role in cell-cell adhesion. However, α-catenin may also regulate adhesion-independent functions of β-catenin. In this report we provide evidence supporting a role for α-catenin in the nucleus.The mechanism by which α-catenin overexpression inhibits β-catenin·Tcf-dependent transcription has been proposed to be by sequestration of β-catenin in the cytoplasm (11.Simcha I. Shtutman M. Salomon D. Zhurinsky J. Sadot E. Geiger B. Ben-Ze'ev A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1433-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). This seems unlikely, first, because endogenous α-catenin and exogenously expressed GFP-α-catenin can be found in cell nuclei, and second, because when α-catenin is targeted to the nucleus, it inhibits transcriptional activity to the same extent as nontargeted α-catenin. Because α-catenin associates stably with the β-catenin·Tcf complex in cells expressing all three proteins, it may inhibit β-catenin·Tcf transcription by preventing DNA binding. The results of gel retardation experiments (Fig. 5 B) support this model, although they do not rule out that α-catenin also alters β-catenin·Tcf interactions with other proteins that regulate transcription in vivo.α-Catenin was present in the nuclei of SW480 and DLD-1 cells but not in the nuclei of HCT116 cells. The reason for this is presently unknown, but it suggests that nuclear localization of α-catenin is not determined solely by β-catenin and that it may be regulated by other mechanisms. Nuclear entry of α-catenin may also be regulated in nontransformed cells, for example during Wnt signaling. Sensitive assays may be required to test this, because it may involve transient changes in the localization of a fraction of the total cellular α-catenin.Factors that regulate nuclear entry of α-catenin would link signaling events in the cytoplasm to β-catenin-dependent transcription in the nucleus. One possibility is that α-catenin responds to changes in the actin cytoskeleton. α-Catenin associates with a number of cytoskeletal proteins including α-actinin, vinculin, ZO proteins, and actin (3.Provost E. Rimm D.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 567-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The binding of these proteins (except possibly actin; see below) to α-catenin does not appear to be necessary for inhibition of transcription, because GFP-αΔ-NLS inhibits transcription to a similar extent as GFP-α-NLS. However, such interactions may regulate the ability of endogenous α-catenin to enter the nucleus and repress transcription.An interesting possibility is that the effects of α-catenin on gene expression involve its ability to bind actin. Actin is normally rapidly exported from the nucleus (41.Wada A. Fukuda M. Mishima M. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1635-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), but it can accumulate there under certain conditions (42.Nishida E. Iida K. Yonezawa N. Koyasu S. Yahara I. Sakai H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5262-5266Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), and actin mutants that accumulate in the nucleus reduce cell proliferation (41.Wada A. Fukuda M. Mishima M. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1635-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Moreover, changes in the level of actin can regulate transcriptional activity (43.Sotiropoulos A. Gineitis D. Copeland J. Treisman R. Cell. 1999; 98: 159-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). α-Catenin has two domains that bind actin in vitro, a major site in the C-terminal domain and a second site close to the β-catenin-binding site (22.Rimm D.L. Koslov E.R. Kebriaei P. Cianci C.D. Morrow J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8813-8817Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). Although GFP-αΔ-NLS does not contain the major site, it retains the second actin-binding site. Thus, it remains possible that binding to actin plays a part in the effects of α-catenin on β-catenin-dependent transcription.Our results suggest that the relative levels of β-catenin·Tcf and α-catenin·β-catenin·Tcf complexes in the nucleus will determine the overall transcriptional activity. Thus, in SW480 cells, where the amount of β-catenin far exceeds that of α-catenin, one would predict that endogenous nuclear α-catenin will not significantly affect transcription. In contrast, in DLD-1 cells, which contain far lower levels of β-catenin than SW480 cells (Fig. 1 A), one would predict that loss of α-catenin would result in increased β-catenin·Tcf transcriptional activity. This appears to be the case because Tcf-dependent activity in DLD α− cells is 30% higher than in any of the other DLD cell lines (Fig. 2 C). These results were obtained using TopFlash and FopFlash reporter plasmids. Because the basal (Tcf-independent) activity measured by FopFlash can be high in some cells (30.da Costa L.T. He T.C., Yu, J. Sparks A.B. Morin P.J. Polyak K. Laken S. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5010-5014Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), the apparent Tcf-dependent transcriptional activities calculated (determined as the ratio of TopFlash and FopFlash measurements) may obscure differences in Tcf-specific activity among the cell lines. We have also compared Tcf-dependent transcriptional activity using the optimized OT and OF reporter plasmids (30.da Costa L.T. He T.C., Yu, J. Sparks A.B. Morin P.J. Polyak K. Laken S. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5010-5014Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The low basal (Tcf-independent) activity measured using OF results in a more accurate calculation of Tcf-dependent activity (as determined by the ratio of OT and OF measurements). The activity in DLD α− cells is 50% higher than in the other DLD cell lines when measured using the OT and OF reporters, confirming the results obtained using TopFlash/FopFlash.2 To date we have been unable to examine the effect of loss of endogenous α-catenin on β-catenin signaling in other colon cancer cell lines because there are no other cells known to have mutations both in α-catenin and in either β-catenin or APC.The expression of α-catenin is often reduced during tumor progression (17.Hirohashi S. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 153: 333-339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar), and several cancer-derived cell lines have mutations in the α-catenin gene. Reintroduction of α-catenin into such lines reduces cell growth (18.Watabe M. Nagafuchi A. Tsukita S. Takeichi M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar) and attenuates tumor formation (19.Bullions L.C. Notterman D.A. Chung L.S. Levine A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4501-4508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, DLD-1 cells that have lost α-catenin expression are more invasive than the parental cell line (44.Vermeulen S.J. Bruyneel E.A. Bracke M.E. De Bruyne G.K. Vennekens K.M. Vleminckx K.L. Berx G.J. van Roy F.M. Mareel M.M. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4722-4728PubMed Google Scholar). An important question that will be addressed in the future is whether the increased invasiveness of DLD α− cells is due to a reduction in cell adhesion or to an increase in β-catenin·Tcf transcription activity. Interestingly, in a recent study of samples from colorectal carcinoma patients (45.Gofuku J. Shiozaki H. Tsujinaka T. Inoue M. Tamura S. Doki Y. Matsui S. Tsukita S. Kikkawa N. Monden M. Am. J. Clin. Pathol. 1999; 111: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), many of the tumors examined had reduced expression of either E-cadherin (29%) or α-catenin (56%), but increased tumor cell invasion and metastasis correlated with reduced expression of α-catenin. This suggests that α-catenin may function in an adhesion-independent manner to regulate invasion and metastasis. All the results presented in this report were obtained using cultured cells, and therefore, further analysis will be required to determine whether similar mechanisms operate in vivo. If this proves to be the case and if the effects of α-catenin on cell adhesion and transcriptional activity are separable, the targeted expression of α-catenin to the nucleus may be a useful approach for treating cancer cells that have activating mutations in the Wnt signaling pathway. β-Catenin has two separable functions; it is a component of the Wnt signal transduction pathway that results in axis formation and cell fate choice during embryonic development (1.Wodarz A. Nusse R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 59-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar, 2.Eastman Q. Grosschedl R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar), and it is part of the cadherin cell adhesion complex (3.Provost E. Rimm D.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 567-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The central armadillo repeat domain of β-catenin is necessary for both of these functions, because it directly binds Tcf/LEF-11family transcription factors to transduce Wnt signals and cadherins to promote cell-cell adhesion. In the current model of the Wnt signaling pathway, the cytosolic level of β-catenin is controlled by phosphorylation and ubiquitin-dependent degradation. Wnt signals stabilize β-catenin, allowing it to associate with Tcf/LEF-1 family members and enter the nucleus to regulate gene expression. β-Catenin can also enter the nucleus independently, in a manner similar to that of the nuclear transport protein importin-β (4.Fagotto F. Gluck U. Gumbiner B.M. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 181-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Yokoya F. Imamoto N. Tachibana T. Yoneda Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1119-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), suggesting that β-catenin may be a specific importin for other proteins. Support for this comes from studies of Armadillo (the Drosophilahomologue of β-catenin), which co-imports the transcription factor Teashirt into the nucleus (6.Gallet A. Angelats C. Erkner A. Charroux B. Fasano L. Kerridge S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2208-2217Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Several tumor types harbor mutations in the genes encoding the tumor suppressor APC or β-catenin. These mutations result in permanent activation of Wnt target genes because the β-catenin·Tcf complex is no longer regulated by degradation of β-catenin (7.Morin P.J. Sparks A.B. Korinek V. Barker N. Clevers H. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1997; 275: 1787-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3480) Google Scholar, 8.Rubinfeld B. Robbins P. El-Gamil M. Albert I. Porfiri E. Polakis P.

A. 1997; 94: 10330-10334Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Importantly, proteins that are not involved in β-catenin stability can also regulate β-catenin signaling. NEMO-like kinase, for example, inhibits the interaction between the β-catenin·Tcf complex and DNA by phosphorylating Tcf/LEF proteins (10.Ishitani T. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Nagai S. Nishita M. Meneghini M. Barker N. Waterman M. Bowerman B. Clevers H. Shibuya H. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 399: 798-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). α-Catenin is another protein that can inhibit β-catenin signaling independently of stabilizing mutations in β-catenin or APC (11.Simcha I.

Cell Res. 2000; 255: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). α-Catenin associates directly with β-catenin (13.Aberle H. Butz S. Stappert J. Weissig H. Kemler R. Hoschuetzky H. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3655-3663Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Jou T.S. Stewart D.B. Stappert J. Nelson W.J. Marrs J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5067-5071Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), linking cadherins to the actin cytoskeleton, an interaction that is essential for strong cell-cell adhesion (15.Hirano S. Kimoto N.

The expression of α-catenin is often reduced during tumor progression (17.Hirohashi S. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 153: 333-339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar), and several cancer-derived cell lines have mutations in the α-catenin gene (18.Watabe M. Nagafuchi A. Tsukita S. Takeichi M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar,19.Bullions L.C. Notterman D.A. Chung L.S. Levine A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4501-4508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reintroduction of α-catenin into such lines reduces cell growth (18.Watabe M. Nagafuchi A. Tsukita S. Takeichi M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar) and attenuates tumor formation (19.Bullions L.C. Notterman D.A. Chung L.S. Levine A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4501-4508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the tumor suppressor function of α-catenin is generally believed to result from its promotion of cell-cell adhesion, the possibility that α-catenin influences tumor progression by regulating β-catenin signaling has not been investigated. We examined β-catenin signaling in colon cancer cell lines and found that loss of α-catenin expression correlated with increased β-catenin·Tcf-dependent transcription. Furthermore, α-catenin was found in cell nuclei, suggesting a role in processes other than cell adhesion. In support of this possibility, ectopic expression of α-catenin in the nucleus inhibited β-catenin·Tcf signaling, and α-catenin disrupted the interaction between the β-catenin·Tcf complex and DNA in vitro. DISCUSSIONThe tumor suppressor function of α-catenin is generally believed to result from its role in cell-cell adhesion. However, α-catenin may also regulate adhesion-independent functions of β-catenin. In this report we provide evidence supporting a role for α-catenin in the nucleus.The mechanism by which α-catenin overexpression inhibits β-catenin·Tcf-dependent transcription has been proposed to be by sequestration of β-catenin in the cytoplasm (11.Simcha I. Shtutman M. Salomon D. Zhurinsky J. Sadot E. Geiger B. Ben-Ze'ev A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1433-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). This seems unlikely, first, because endogenous α-catenin and exogenously expressed GFP-α-catenin can be found in cell nuclei, and second, because when α-catenin is targeted to the nucleus, it inhibits transcriptional activity to the same extent as nontargeted α-catenin. Because α-catenin associates stably with the β-catenin·Tcf complex in cells expressing all three proteins, it may inhibit β-catenin·Tcf transcription by preventing DNA binding. The results of gel retardation experiments (Fig. 5 B) support this model, although they do not rule out that α-catenin also alters β-catenin·Tcf interactions with other proteins that regulate transcription in vivo.α-Catenin was present in the nuclei of SW480 and DLD-1 cells but not in the nuclei of HCT116 cells. The reason for this is presently unknown, but it suggests that nuclear localization of α-catenin is not determined solely by β-catenin and that it may be regulated by other mechanisms. Nuclear entry of α-catenin may also be regulated in nontransformed cells, for example during Wnt signaling. Sensitive assays may be required to test this, because it may involve transient changes in the localization of a fraction of the total cellular α-catenin.Factors that regulate nuclear entry of α-catenin would link signaling events in the cytoplasm to β-catenin-dependent transcription in the nucleus. One possibility is that α-catenin responds to changes in the actin cytoskeleton. α-Catenin associates with a number of cytoskeletal proteins including α-actinin, vinculin, ZO proteins, and actin (3.Provost E. Rimm D.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 567-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The binding of these proteins (except possibly actin; see below) to α-catenin does not appear to be necessary for inhibition of transcription, because GFP-αΔ-NLS inhibits transcription to a similar extent as GFP-α-NLS. However, such interactions may regulate the ability of endogenous α-catenin to enter the nucleus and repress transcription.An interesting possibility is that the effects of α-catenin on gene expression involve its ability to bind actin. Actin is normally rapidly exported from the nucleus (41.Wada A. Fukuda M. Mishima M. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1635-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), but it can accumulate there under certain conditions (42.Nishida E. Iida K. Yonezawa N. Koyasu S. Yahara I. Sakai H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5262-5266Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), and actin mutants that accumulate in the nucleus reduce cell proliferation (41.Wada A. Fukuda M. Mishima M. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1635-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Moreover, changes in the level of actin can regulate transcriptional activity (43.Sotiropoulos A. Gineitis D. Copeland J. Treisman R. Cell. 1999; 98: 159-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). α-Catenin has two domains that bind actin in vitro, a major site in the C-terminal domain and a second site close to the β-catenin-binding site (22.Rimm D.L. Koslov E.R. Kebriaei P. Cianci C.D. Morrow J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8813-8817Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). Although GFP-αΔ-NLS does not contain the major site, it retains the second actin-binding site. Thus, it remains possible that binding to actin plays a part in the effects of α-catenin on β-catenin-dependent transcription.Our results suggest that the relative levels of β-catenin·Tcf and α-catenin·β-catenin·Tcf complexes in the nucleus will determine the overall transcriptional activity.

These results were obtained using TopFlash and FopFlash reporter plasmids. Because the basal (Tcf-independent) activity measured by FopFlash can be high in some cells (30.da Costa L.T.

To define the role of εPKC signaling in pathological myocardial hypertrophy, εV1 or ψεRACK were co-expressed in mouse hearts with Gαq, a PKC-linked hypertrophy signal transducer. Compared with Gαq overexpression alone, co-expression of ψεRACK with Gαq increased εPKC particulate partitioning by 30 ± 2%, whereas co-expression of εV1 with Gαqreduced particulate-associated εPKC by 22 ± 1%. Facilitation of εPKC translocation by ψεRACK in Gαq mice improved cardiac contractile function measured as left ventricular fractional shortening (30 ± 3% Gαq versus 43 ± 2% ψεRACK/Gαq,p < 0.05). Conversely, inhibition of εPKC by εV1 modified the Gαq nonfailing hypertrophy phenotype to that of a lethal dilated cardiomyopathy. These opposing effects of εPKC translocation activation and inhibition in Gαqhypertrophy indicate that εPKC signaling is a compensatory event in myocardial hypertrophy, rather than a pathological event, and support the possible therapeutic efficacy of selective εPKC translocation enhancement in cardiac insufficiency. The ε isoform of protein kinase C (PKC) has a critical cardiotrophic function in normal postnatal developing heart as demonstrated by cardiac-specific transgenic expression of εPKC-selective translocation inhibitor (εV1) and activator (ψεRACK) peptides (Mochly-Rosen, D., Wu, G., Hahn, H., Osinska, H., Liron, T., Lorenz, J.

It has been difficult to establish particular roles for individual PKC isoforms due to the absence of isoform-specific agonists and antagonists. Targeted cardiac overexpression of PKC has been helpful in establishing possible effects of myocardial PKC β signaling (4Wakasaki H. Koya D. Schoen F.J. Jirousek M.R. Ways D.K. Hoit B.D. Walsh R.A.

Based on recent insights into the mechanism for differential PKC isoform subcellular translocation upon activation (6Mochly-Rosen D. Science. 1995; 268: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar), a strategy was developed whereby the effects of endogenous myocardial PKC isoforms such as εPKC could be elucidated by cardiac-specific expression of peptides that specifically modulate PKC isoform translocation/activation (7Dorn G.W., II Souroujon M.C. Liron T. Chen C.H. Gray M.O. Zhou H.Z. Csukai M. Wu G. Lorenz J.N. Mochly-Rosen D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12798-12803Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 8Mochly-Rosen D.

These εPKC-derived peptides, ψεRACK (HDAPIGYD, rat εPKC amino acids 85–92) and εV1 (the first variable region of rat εPKC, amino acids 2–144) have previously been shown to specifically modulate εPKC translocation (7Dorn G.W., II Souroujon M.C.

Compared with transgenic overexpression of PKC, a critical advantage of translocation modification is that PKC isoforms are specifically regulated without changing the natural stoichiometric relationships of PKC to its upstream activators and downstream substrates. Cardiac transgenic models expressing either the εPKC translocation inhibitor (εV1) or activator (ψεRACK) were previously created with opposing cardiac phenotypes of dilated cardiomyopathy and physiological hypertrophy, respectively (8Mochly-Rosen D. Wu G. Hahn H. Osinska H. Liron T. Lorenz J.N. Robbins J. Dorn G.W., II. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 1173-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), demonstrating that εPKC signaling is both necessary and sufficient for normal myocardial growth in the developing young mouse. This apparently beneficial role for εPKC in normal physiologic cardiac growth is, however, at odds with the widely held notion that pathological cardiac hypertrophy is the consequence of εPKC signaling (1Bowling N. Walsh R.A. Song G. Estridge T. Sandusky G.E. Fouts R.L. Mintze K. Pickard T. Roden R. Bristow M.R. Sabbah H.N. Mizrahi J.L. Gromo G. King G.L. Vlahos C.J.

In addressing this apparent contradiction, we hypothesized that the effects of εPKC on a diseased heart might be different than during normal heart development. We further considered that these putative pathologic effects could be identified using εPKC-specific translocation modification in the context of a form of cardiac hypertrophy where εPKC is thought to be a pathological mediator, like the cardiac-specific Gαq-overexpressing mouse, which develops myocardial hypertrophy and contractile depression associated with εPKC translocation (11D'Angelo D.D. Sakata Y. Lorenz J.N. Boivin G.P. Walsh R.A. Liggett S.B. Dorn G.W., II. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8121-8126Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 12Dorn G.W., II Tepe N.M.

Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 278-287PubMed Google Scholar). εV1 or ψεRACK were therefore co-expressed with Gαq by cross-breeding the respective individual transgenic mice to generate compound transgenic mice. Details of transgenic mice (FVB/N background) overexpressing Gαq, εV1, or ψεRACK under control of the full-length mouse α−myosin heavy chain (MHC) promoter have previously been described (7Dorn G.W., II Souroujon M.C.

Gαqmice express Gαq at ∼5 times nontransgenic levels (the line previously described as Gαq-40) and develop nonfailing ventricular hypertrophy with modest contractile depression, which is unresponsive to β-adrenergic agonists (11D'Angelo D.D. Sakata Y. Lorenz J.N. Boivin G.P. Walsh R.A. Liggett S.B. Dorn G.W., II. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Liron T. Chen C.H. Gray M.O. Zhou H.Z. Csukai M. Wu G. Lorenz J.N. Mochly-Rosen D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12798-12803Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 8Mochly-Rosen D.

The εV1low (lowest expressing) mice used herein have normal cardiac mass and function, whereas higher expressing εV1 lines develop ventricular dilation with wall thinning, diminished systolic function, and heart failure (8Mochly-Rosen D. Wu G. Hahn H. Osinska H. Liron T. Lorenz J.N. Robbins J. Dorn G.W., II. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 1173-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Compound transgenic mice overexpressing εV1 or ψεRACK and Gαq were obtained by breeding heterozygous εV1low or ψεRACK with heterozygous Gαq-40 mice. Transgenes, alone and in combination, were identified by genomic Southern analysis of tail clip DNA. All experiments were performed with comparison of littermates. Samples for measurement of transgene products and PKC expression were prepared as described previously (12Dorn G.W., II Tepe N.M. Wu G. Yatani A. Liggett S.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 278-287PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, mouse ventricles frozen at −80 °C were homogenized in buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 10 mm benzamidine, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) followed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The pellet was further extracted with buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 for 30 min on ice. Proteins were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. εV1 and Gαq transgene expression were evaluated by Western blot analysis using anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma) and anti-Gαq/11 (Santa Cruz) monoclonal antibodies, respectively. PKC isoform expression was measured by quantitative immunoblot analysis with anti-αPKC (Santa Cruz) and anti-εPKC antibodies (Transduction Laboratories) using recombinant human αPKC and εPKC (Calbiochem) as quantitative standards (8Mochly-Rosen D. Wu G. Hahn H. Osinska H. Liron T. Lorenz J.N. Robbins J. Dorn G.W., II. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 1173-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 12Dorn G.W., II Tepe N.M. Wu G. Yatani A. Liggett S.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 278-287PubMed Google Scholar). Protein loading and transfer efficiency were evaluated by amido black staining of the membrane after immunoblotting. Morphometric analysis and histological examination of Masson's trichrome-stained ventricles used standard techniques. Echocardiography was performed to determine cardiac contractile function in a noninvasive manner; left ventricular fractional shortening (the proportion of blood ejected during systole compared with maximal ventricular capacity in diastole) and left ventricular mass were calculated (14Sakata Y. Hoit B.D. Liggett S.B. Walsh R.A. Dorn G.W., II Circulation. 1998; 97: 1488-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Cardiac gene expression was assayed by RNA dot blot analysis using total RNA (3 μg/dot) extracted from ventricles of nontransgenic and transgenic mice and 32P-labeled oligonucleotides as probes (11D'Angelo D.D. Sakata Y. Lorenz J.N. Boivin G.P. Walsh R.A. Liggett S.B. Dorn G.W., II. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8121-8126Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Hybridization was quantified using a Storm PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) and expression of each cardiac gene was normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. All data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Comparisons between Gαq and dual transgenic mice were evaluated using Student's t test, and the p value of <0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Values for nontransgenic (NTG) siblings are also presented for comparison, but were not included in the statistical analysis. Cardiac-targeted transgenic expression of εV1 and resulting inhibition of myocardial εPKC translocation has proven that εPKC activation is necessary for normal physiological myocardial growth in the postnatal period (8Mochly-Rosen D. Wu G. Hahn H. Osinska H. Liron T. Lorenz J.N. Robbins J. Dorn G.W., II. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 1173-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Complementing this finding is the observation that enhancing εPKC activation by expression of ψεRACK stimulates growth of normally functioning myocardium (8Mochly-Rosen D. Wu G. Hahn H. Osinska H. Liron T. Lorenz J.N. Robbins J. Dorn G.W., II. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 1173-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Herein, we utilized in vivo translocation modulation to characterize εPKC effects in Gαq-stimulated cardiac hypertrophy, a form of hypertrophy in which εPKC translocation is increased and in which εPKC has therefore been considered to be a possible pathological mediator (11D'Angelo D.D. Sakata Y. Lorenz J.N. Boivin G.P. Walsh R.A. Liggett S.B. Dorn G.W., II. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8121-8126Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 12Dorn G.W., II Tepe N.M. Wu G. Yatani A. Liggett S.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 278-287PubMed Google Scholar). Compound transgenic mice were generated and ventricular expression of εV1 and Gαq was compared between parent mice and dual transgenic progeny by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1A). Compound transgenic mice expressed both εV1 and Gαq at the same levels as parent lines, indicating that no cross-talk occurred at the level of transgene expression. As reported previously, it is not possible to detect ψεRACK expression by Western blot analysis due to the small molecular weight of the peptide (8Mochly-Rosen D. Wu G. Hahn H. Osinska H. Liron T. Lorenz J.N. Robbins J. Dorn G.W., II. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 1173-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). However, Northern blot analysis showed no change in ψεRACK and Gαq transgene expression in compound transgenic mice, compared with parent lines (data not shown). Gαq activates PKC via phospholipase C (15Simon M.I. Strathmann M.P. Gautam N. Science. 1991; 252: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1591) Google Scholar). As expected from this signaling pathway, myocardial Gαqoverexpression results in increased εPKC partitioning to particulates, i.e. translocation, associated with a decrease in total εPKC content which is considered to be a consequence of chronic εPKC activation (11D'Angelo D.D. Sakata Y. Lorenz J.N. Boivin G.P. Walsh R.A. Liggett S.B. Dorn G.W., II. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8121-8126Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 12Dorn G.W., II Tepe N.M. Wu G. Yatani A. Liggett S.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 278-287PubMed Google Scholar). We measured the effects of ψεRACK and εV1 on the expression and translocation of εPKC in Gαq overexpressors using quantitative Western blot analysis. αPKC, which is transcriptionally up-regulated but not translocated in Gαq overexpressing hearts (12Dorn G.W., II Tepe N.M. Wu G. Yatani A. Liggett S.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 278-287PubMed Google Scholar), was also measured to assay the isoform specificity of εV1 and ψεRACK. Compared with nontransgenic siblings, ψεRACK and εV1 transgenic mice exhibited a 20 ± 3% increase and 15 ± 2% decrease, respectively, of εPKC translocation (measured as the paticulate/cytosol ratio) with no change in εPKC content (data not shown). This is similar to the initial description of these models (7Dorn G.W., II Souroujon M.C. Liron T. Chen C.H. Gray M.O. Zhou H.Z. Csukai M. Wu G. Lorenz J.N. Mochly-Rosen D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

As shown in Fig. 1 B, combined expression of either ψεRACK or εV1 with Gαq did not alter the characteristically decreased myocardial εPKC content of Gαq overexpressors (12Dorn G.W., II Tepe N.M. Wu G. Yatani A. Liggett S.B. Mol.

Effects of enhanced εPKC translocation/activation on Gαq-mediated cardiac hypertrophy and contractile dysfunction were assessed in 12-week-old ψεRACK/Gαqmice. Compared with Gαq transgenic siblings, ventricular and atrial weights in ψεRACK/Gαq mice were reduced (Table I). Left ventricular mass of ψεRACK/Gαq mice calculated from noninvasive echocardiographic analysis was correspondingly decreased (TableII). Echocardiography further revealed that ψεRACK/Gαq hearts had reduced end diastolic and systolic dimensions, i.e. that the cardiac ventricles were smaller before or after contraction, with no change in left ventricular wall thickness (Table II). Thus, the ratio of wall thickness to ventricular radius (h/r) was increased, which suggests concentric ventricular remodeling. Perhaps as a consequence of this more favorable ventricular geometry, ψεRACK expression enhanced left ventricular contractile function of Gαq mice, measured echocardiographically as the proportion of blood volume ejected per cardiac cycle, or fractional shortening (NTG 51 ± 3%, ψεRACK 47 ± 1%, Gαq 30 ± 3% and ψεRACK/Gαq 43 ± 2%).Table IMorphometric parameters in NTG, single and dual 12-week-old transgenic miceNTGGαqψεRACK/GαqNTGGαqεV1/GαqHeart/body wt, mg/g4.7 ± 0.25.4 ± 0.24.7 ± 0.11-ap < 0.05 versus Gαq, n = 5–11 per group.4.7 ± 0.25.8 ± 0.75.6 ± 0.3Dry atria, mg3.4 ± 0.14.7 ± 0.33.8 ± 01-ap < 0.05 versus Gαq, n = 5–11 per group.3.4 ± 0.24.1 ± 0.46.0 ± 0.9Dry atrium/body wt, mg/g0.14 ± 0.010.17 ± 0.010.14 ± 0.011-ap < 0.05 versus Gαq, n = 5–11 per group.0.15 ± 0.020.21 ± 0.030.35 ± 0.041-ap < 0.05 versus Gαq, n = 5–11 per group.Dry ventricles, mg19.3 ± 0.328.4 ± 1.123.9 ± 0.61-ap < 0.05 versus Gαq, n = 5–11 per group.18.6 ± 0.423.7 ± 0.417.3 ± 0.61-ap < 0.05 versus Gαq, n = 5–11 per group.Dry ventricle/body wt, mg/g0.8 ± 0.031.1 ± 0.060.9 ± 0.041-ap < 0.05 versus Gαq, n = 5–11 per group.0.8 ± 0.041.2 ± 0.051.0 ± 0.031-ap < 0.05 versus Gαq, n = 5–11 per group.Liver/body wt, mg/g47 ± 345 ± 346 ± 150 ± 148 ± 151 ± 2Lung/body wt, mg/g7.7 ± 0.37.4 ± 0.37.2 ± 0.46.2 ± 0.67.0 ± 0.26.6 ± 0.3Values are mean ± S.E.1-a p < 0.05 versus Gαq, n = 5–11 per group.

A molecular marker of cardiac hypertrophy is increased expression of the embryonic cardiac genes α-skeletal actin, β-MHC, and atrial netriuretic peptide (ANF) in ventricle (16Chien K.R. Knowlton K.U. Zhu H. Chien S. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3037-3046Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). These genes are highly expressed in Gαq overexpressing hearts (11D'Angelo D.D. Sakata Y. Lorenz J.N. Boivin G.P. Walsh R.A. Liggett S.B. Dorn G.W., II. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8121-8126Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 14Sakata Y. Hoit B.D. Liggett S.B. Walsh R.A. Dorn G.W., II Circulation. 1998; 97: 1488-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), and Northern analysis revealed that α-skeletal actin gene expression was selectively reduced in ventricles of ψεRACK/Gαqmice, whereas ANF and β-MHC gene expression was not changed from their characteristically elevated levels (11D'Angelo D.D. Sakata Y. Lorenz J.N. Boivin G.P. Walsh R.A. Liggett S.B. Dorn G.W., II. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8121-8126Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar) (Fig.2 B). Since inhibition of εPKC with εV1 in normal hearts was previously shown to selectively increase expression of α-skeletal actin gene (8Mochly-Rosen D. Wu G. Hahn H. Osinska H. Liron T. Lorenz J.N. Robbins J. Dorn G.W., II. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 1173-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), the isolated reduction of this mRNA by ψεRACK in the Gαq mice suggests a role for εPKC in transcriptionally regulating actin, but not ANF or β-MHC expression, in the heart. Taken together, the results with ψεRACK/Gαq mice indicate that enhanced εPKC translocation improves ventricular function and normalizes ventricular geometry, but surprisingly, diminishes the extent of cardiac hypertrophy in Gαq overexpressors. Heart failure is not typically observed in Gαq-overexpressing mice, although the characteristic eccentric hypertrophy is associated with measurable contractile depression (11D'Angelo D.D. Sakata Y. Lorenz J.N. Boivin G.P. Walsh R.A. Liggett S.B. Dorn G.W., II. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8121-8126Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Heart failure also is not a feature of εV1low mice in which hearts are functionally and histologically normal (8Mochly-Rosen D. Wu G. Hahn H. Osinska H. Liron T. Lorenz J.N. Robbins J. Dorn G.W., II. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 1173-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Thus, breeding Gαq with εV1low is the equivalent of crossing two nonfailing cardiac models. Strikingly, combined expression of εV1lowwith Gαq caused development of lethal heart failure at 14 ± 2 weeks of age (n = 9). At 12 weeks of age, εV1/Gαq mice could not tolerate echocardiographic analysis under even light anesthesia, so a confident assessment of in vivo ventricular function at an age matching that of the ψεRACK/Gαq mice was not obtained. However, gross pathological examination of 12-week-old hearts revealed ventricular dilatation, focal ventricular wall thinning, and massively enlarged atria containing intracavitary blood clots, which are typically observed in chronic low cardiac output states, i.e. heart failure (Fig. 2 A). These gross pathological findings were much more striking than the histological appearance which revealed only areas of mild myocardial fibrosis, as detected by blue staining with Masson's trichrome (Fig. 2 C), Interestingly, εV1 overexpression did not alter the program of ANF, β-MHC, or α-skeletal actin gene expression in Gαq mice (Fig.2 B). Since a clear mechanism for development of heart failure was not readily apparent from these postmortem studies, and as 12-week-old mice were too sick to undergo in vivophysiological assessment, we performed echocardiographic examination of apparently healthy 6-week-old εV1/Gαq mice to help define the relevant pathophysiology. At 6 weeks, εV1/Gαq hearts exhibited ventricular enlargement and wall thinning with depressed contractile function (fractional shortening) compared with Gαq, which at this age have not yet developed contractile dysfunction (Table II). These findings suggested that εV1low inhibits myocardial growth in the young developing Gαq mice, as εV1high did in mice with a normal genetic background (8Mochly-Rosen D. Wu G. Hahn H. Osinska H. Liron T. Lorenz J.N. Robbins J. Dorn G.W., II. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 1173-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). This notion was confirmed by a 27% reduction in dry ventricular weight of εV1/Gαq mice, compared with Gαq (TableI). In contrast, atrial weight was increased, which, as noted above, probably reflects contractile depression. Finally, the ratio of ventricular wall thickness to ventricular radius (h/r) was significantly diminished, indicating that dilatory remodeling,i.e. ventricular wall thinning with chamber enlargement, was already occurring in 6-week-old εV1/Gαq mice. Thus, inhibition of εPKC translocation, which is already “enhanced” in the Gαq mouse, impairs ventricular function, causes cardiac enlargement with ventricular dilatation, and reduces ventricular mass. The reciprocal cardiac phenotypes of ψεRACK/Gαq and εV1/Gαq mice described above unequivocally refute our hypothesis that εPKC signaling contributes to the pathology associated with Gαq-mediated hypertrophy. Although εPKC activation occurs in Gαq hearts, “superactivation” with ψεRACK proved to be therapeutic, whereas even the modest impairment of εPKC translocation caused by εV1low, essentially “normalization,” greatly exaggerated the underlying Gαq pathology. Most surprising is that the opposing effects on cardiac function were not due to opposite effects on cardiac “hypertrophy” per se, in that ψεRACK and εV1 both decreased left ventricular mass of Gαq mice. Rather, it is apparently an εPKC effect on ventricular geometry that is the critical determinant of viability, with benefit accruing from ψεRACK-induced concentric remodeling (of the eccentrically hypertrophied Gαq heart (11D'Angelo D.D. Sakata Y. Lorenz J.N. Boivin G.P. Walsh R.A. Liggett S.B. Dorn G.W., II. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8121-8126Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar)) and εV1-induced ventricular dilatation proving fatal. These changes in geometry were surprisingly well defined in that they were not associated with significant changes in ANF or β-MHC gene expression, which are widely considered to be indices of cardiac pathology (16Chien K.R. Knowlton K.U. Zhu H. Chien S. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3037-3046Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). In the context of our prior study (8Mochly-Rosen D. Wu G. Hahn H. Osinska H. Liron T. Lorenz J.N. Robbins J. Dorn G.W., II. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 1173-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), the current results show that the molecular and morphometric effects of εPKC are similar in nontransgenic and Gαq overexpressing hearts, but the effects of εPKC activation and inhibition are amplified in the Gαqmodel. An intriguing difference between the current studies of εPKC in the Gαq background and our previous characterization of εPKC translocation modulation in the normal background is the absence of a “hypertrophic” effect of ψεRACK plus Gαq. We previously found a modest increase in ventricular mass of 12-week-old ψεRACK mice, with concentric remodeling. Compared with Gαq, however, ψεRACK/Gαq ventricles were concentrically remodeled, but smaller. This suggests that the intrinsic contractile depression and eccentric remodeling of Gαq mice may itself contribute to the hypertrophic response. ψεRACK improved ventricular geometry and function and as a consequence diminished the external stimulus for hypertrophy. A strength of the current studies is that εPKC activity/translocation was modulated by expressing catalytically inactive peptides rather than by overexpressing εPKC itself, essentially using transgenesis as a means of organ-specific drug delivery. However, the effects of εPKC modulation were measured in the Gαq transgenic mouse, which achieves its phenotype by 5-fold increased expression of Gαq (11D'Angelo D.D. Sakata Y. Lorenz J.N. Boivin G.P. Walsh R.A. Liggett S.B. Dorn G.W., II. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8121-8126Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Thus, concerns regarding stoichiometric excess and nonspecific activity of overexpressed signaling proteins (which drove our unique approach of PKC isoform translocation modification) apply to the Gαq model itself. While the rationale for choosing the Gαq model is strong, i.e. changes in εPKC translocation, which suggested it as a pathological mediator (11D'Angelo D.D. Sakata Y. Lorenz J.N. Boivin G.P. Walsh R.A. Liggett S.B. Dorn G.W., II. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8121-8126Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 12Dorn G.W., II Tepe N.M. Wu G. Yatani A. Liggett S.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 278-287PubMed Google Scholar), the relevance of Gαq overexpression to naturally occurring cardiac disease is uncertain. Additional studies are therefore ongoing to determine the effects of εV1 and ψεRACK on cardiac hypertrophy and function in hemodynamically stressed hearts. In conclusion, the current studies contradict the generally accepted notion that εPKC is a pathophysiological mediator of cardiac disease. Rather, they support the notion that εPKC translocation, either by direct administration of ψεRACK peptide, by gene therapy, or through novel pharmacological means, could be used to treat heart failure in the same manner that induction of “physiological” hypertrophy by exercise or growth factors has proven to be therapeutic (17Fazio S.

Sasaki T. Yamashita S. Insect Biochem. 1990; 20: 725-734Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar) to acidic cysteine proteinases such as cathepsins B and L (5Medina M. León P. Vallejo C.G. Arch. Biochem.

In the blood-sucking insect Rhodnius prolixus, a cathepsin D-like enzyme activity was identified (9Nussenzveig R.H. Oliveira P.L. Masuda H. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 1992; 21: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In the tick Boophilus microplus, an aspartic proteinase precursor, BYC (B. yolk cathepsin) has been proposed to play a role in VT degradation during embryogenesis (10Logullo C. Vaz Jr., I.S. Sorgine M.H.F. Paiva e Silva G.O. Faria F.S. Zingali B.R. Lima M.F.R. Masuda H. Gonzales J.C. Masuda A. Oliveira P.L. Parasitology. 1998; 116: 525-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Heme is essential to all living beings as the prosthetic group of essential molecules such as cytochromes and hemoglobins. Almost all organisms are able to synthesize their own heme (11Ponka P. Blood. 1997; 89: 1-25Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with the exception of some pathogenic bacteria and protozoa, which feed on vertebrate blood. Recently it was shown that B. microplusalso acquires its heme by the degrading hemoglobin from the ingested blood (12Braz G.R.C. Coelho H.S.L. Masuda H. Oliveira P.L. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 703-706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), being the first multicellular organism shown to be unable to synthesize the protoporphyrin ring. In relation to the reproduction of ticks, an important outcome of this finding is that the egg must provide all the necessary heme to build up a new organism. It is noteworthy that the most distinguishable feature of VTs from ticks is that they are all hemeproteins (13Roosell R. Coons L.B. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1991; 21: 871-885Google Scholar). Thus, VT is probably the source of heme required for embryo growth. Therefore, besides the need for amino acids for synthesis of new proteins, VT degradation should also be regulated according to the embryo's need for heme. In this work, we describe the purification, cloning, and characterization of a novel aspartic proteinase from the eggs of the hard tick B. microplus (herein named THAP, for tick heme-binding aspartic proteinase), which is capable of binding heme. We present evidence that the THAP heme-binding site functions as a docking site that recognizes heme on the surface of protein substrates, increasing its specificity toward hemeproteins and providing a possible mechanism of regulating tick VT degradation. This mechanism would represent a novel way of regulating the activity of proteinases. Ticks were obtained from a colony maintained at the Faculdade de Veterinária at the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. B. microplus of the Porto Alegre strain, free of Babesia sp., were reared on calves obtained from a tick-free area. Engorged adult females were kept in Petri dishes at 28 °C and 80% relative humidity until completion of oviposition. Eggs laid less than 24 h beforehand were collected and homogenized in a Potter-Elvehjem tissue grinder in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, with 0.05 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 0.05 mg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm benzamidine (approximately 1 g of eggs/2 ml). Egg homogenate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. The floating lipids and the pellet were discarded, and the crude egg extract supernatant was used for protein isolation. Polyacrylamide gels (12 or 10%) were run in the presence of SDS (14Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207159) Google Scholar) at a constant current of 20 mA. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue G according to the method of Neuhoffet al. (15Neuhoff V. Arold N. Taube D. Ehrhardt W. Electrophoresis. 1988; 9: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (2352) Google Scholar) and destained with deionized water. Molecular masses of polypeptides were determined using the following protein standards: myosin (205 kDa), β-galactosidase (116 kDa), phosphorylaseb (94 kDa), bovine albumin (66 kDa), ovalbumin (45 kDa), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (36 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), and cytochrome c (12.5 kDa). Crude egg extract was applied into a column of DEAE-Toyopearl 650M (20 × 3 cm) equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, and eluted with two linear 200-ml NaCl gradient steps (0– 100 mm, 100–400 mm). The fractions containing THAP (identified by SDS-PAGE) were dialyzed against 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, overnight, and applied to a SP-Toyopearl 650m (column (10 × 1.5 cm)) equilibrated with the same buffer and eluted with a 200-ml NaCl gradient (0–210 mm). Fractions containing THAP were applied to an iminodiacetic acid-Sepharose (IDA) column previously loaded with CuCl2 and equilibrated with 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, with 0.2 mNaCl. The column was eluted with a 150-ml continuous glycine gradient (0–300 mm). The fractions containing THAP were concentrated in a Speed-Vac system (Savant SVC 100), and the degree of protein purity was evaluated by SDS-PAGE (12%). Protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (16Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. VT was purified based on the protocol described by Roosell and Coons (13Roosell R. Coons L.B. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1991; 21: 871-885Google Scholar) with some modifications. Egg homogenate was applied to the same DEAE-Toyopearl 650M column used for THAP isolation. The fractions containing VT (identified by SDS-PAGE and by light absorption at 400 nm) were applied to a Sephacryl S-200 gel filtration column (90 × 1.5 cm). The fractions containing VT were concentrated in a Speed-Vac system (Savant SVC 100), and the degree of protein purity was evaluated by SDS-PAGE (10%). THAP (50 μg) was subjected to SDS-PAGE (12%) and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (17Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After staining with Coomassie Blue for 5 min, polypeptide bands were destained with 40% methanol, cut, and applied to the protein sequencer. The sequence was obtained by automatic Edman degradation using a liquid phase sequencer (Porton PI 2090). Phenylthiohydantoin amino acids were identified in a Hewlett-Packard high performance liquid chromatography system (model 1090) with an amino-quant column (200 × 2.1 mm). A forward degenerated primer based on the obtained NH2-terminal sequence (QLGWHDP) was synthesized and used together with a NotI-(dT)18primer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to amplify THAP cDNA from total ovary RNA by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The PCR product was then gel-purified and cloned into a pT7Blue-3 vector using the Perfectly BluntTM cloning kit (Novagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA sequencing was performed using the dideoxy method at the Molecular Genetics Instrumentation Facility of the University of Georgia. The obtained sequences were subjected to a similarities search in nonredundant sequence data banks (NCBI BlastP search). Similarities were determined using the BESTFIT program from the GCG Software Package (Version 8, University of Wisconsin). Multiple sequence analysis was carried out using Clustal W software (18Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acid Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55720) Google Scholar), and the search for known protein motifs in a sequence was made using Blocks+ data base software (19Henikoff S. Henikoff J.G. Pietrokovski S. Bioinformatics. 1999; 15: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Rabbits were inoculated subcutaneously with THAP (0.5 mg in 0.25 ml of water) emulsified with an equal volume of Freund's complete adjuvant. After 1 month, animals were boosted with 0.5 mg of THAP in water. Sera were obtained from blood collected at least 1 month after the second injection. Unless otherwise stated, 200 μg of each protein substrate (bovine hemoglobin, apohemoglobin, ribonuclease A, or purified VT) was incubated in acetate buffer 0.15m, pH 3.5, at 37 °C in 800 μl. The reaction was started by the addition of 10 μg of THAP. At different time intervals, aliquots of 150 μl were taken and immediately added to tubes containing 500 μl of 0.5 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.3. Proteinase inhibitors or hemin were added as indicated in the figure legends. Samples were then added to 200 μl of a 0.03% solution of fluorescamine in acetone in order to titrate newly formed NH2-terminal ends, and the fluorescence (excitation at 375 nm and analysis at 480 nm) was measured using a Hitachi F-4500 spectrofluorometer (20Towbin H.

Hydrolysis of synthetic peptide substrates by THAP was also measured. THAP (10 μg) was incubated in 100 μl of 0.2 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 3.5, at 37 °C with different concentrations of fluorogenic or chromogenic substrates: 300 μm for peptidyl-4-methylcoumarin amine fluorogenic substrates (Chromogenix AB) and 4 mm for Abz-peptidyl-EDDnp fluorogenic substrates (22Hirata I.Y. Cezari M.H.S. Nakaie C.R. Boschcov P. Ito A.S. Juliano M.A. Juliano L. Lett. Peptide Sci. 1994; 1: 299-308Crossref Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The fluorogenic reactions were monitored for 1 hour with a F-MAX fluorometer (Molecular Devices Inc.) using a 320-nm excitation filter and a 420-nm emission filter for the EDDnp substrates and a 370-nm excitation filter and a 460-nm emission filter for the 4-methylcoumarin amine substrates. All experiments were repeated at least twice. Apohemoglobin was obtained through extraction of the heme group from bovine hemoglobin by the acetone-HCl method (23Ascoli F. Fanelli M.R. Antonini E. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 76: 72-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). VT, Hb, apoHb, or ribonuclease A (2 μg) were first blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane, which was then blocked by overnight incubation with 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk, 0.01% Tween 20 in TBS. After that, the membrane was incubated for 90 min with a 0.5 mg/ml THAP plus 10−5m pepstatin in TBS. Hb, apoHb, ribonuclease, or heme was added to this last incubation as indicated in the legend. After the incubation, the membranes were probed with the anti-THAP rabbit serum diluted in the blocking solution. Goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase diluted 1:30,000 (v/v) was used as secondary antibody. Membranes were developed with nitroblue tetrazolium (0.033%, w/v) and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (0.016%, w/v) in Tris-HCl 100 mm, pH 9.6, 0.15 m NaCl, and 5 mmMgCl2. Binding of heme to THAP was monitored by measuring light absorption at 411 nm while progressively adding a solution of 0.1 mm hemin in 0.1 m NaOH (24Oliveira P.L. Kawooya J.K. Ribeiro J.M.C. Meyer T. Poorman R. Alves E.W. Walker F.A. Machado E.A. Nussenzveig R.H. Padovan G.J. Masuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10897-10901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The absorbance was plotted against the amount of hemin added, and the hemin necessary to fully saturate the heme binding capacity of the protein was determined from the break in the curve. The same assay was also used to titrate heme-binding sites of apoHb. Quenching of intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of THAP upon binding of hemin was used to determine the K d of THAP-heme interaction. Protein fluorescence spectra were recorded using an ISS GREG-200 (Urbana Il) spectrofluorometer in which the excitation wavelength was 275 nm, and the emission was measured between 250 and 450 nm. Binding was determined by gradually adding small volumes of a 0.01 mm hemin solution to 1 ml of THAP solution (40 μg/ml) in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, until maximum quenching of protein fluorescence was attained. A control was performed using N-acetyl-l-tryptophanamide instead of THAP to verify whether the observed quenching could be due to absorption by the heme molecule of light produced from fluorescence of the indole group. No significant effect on the fluorescence ofN-acetyl-l-tryptophanamide was observed at these concentrations of heme. K d was determined according to Vincent and Muller-Eberhard (25Vincent S.H. Muller-Eberhard U. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14521-14528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by plotting the molar ratio of bound hemin/mol of THAP against concentration of added hemin. The fraction of bound hemin was calculated from (F o −F)/ F o, where F o is the fluorescence of protein in the absence of ligand, and Fis the fluorescence after ligand addition. The value ofK d was obtained by nonlinear regression analysis of the obtained data (25Vincent S.H. Muller-Eberhard U. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14521-14528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An assay for screening heme-binding proteins using a hemin-agarose gel was performed as described by TsuiTsui & Mueller (26TsuiTsui K. Mueller G.C. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 121: 244-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). 40 μg of protein from the DEAE-Toyopearl peak containing THAP were added to 500 μl of 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 0.15 m NaCl with or without 10 nmol of hemin (as indicated in figure legend) and incubated for 30 min with 10 μl of hemin-agarose (Sigma). After the incubation, the gel was washed five times with 0.5 ml of the same buffer and heated with SDS (40 μl of SDS sample buffer), and the bound polypeptides were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE. B. microplus egg extract was fractionated on a DEAE-Toyopearl column (Fig.1 A), and the peaks were tested for the capacity to bind to a hemin-agarose gel to identify putative heme-binding proteins. Two polypeptides from the first peak of the DEAE column bound to hemin-agarose (Fig. 2). Starting from the peak from the DEAE column, a preparative isolation was carried out by chromatography on a SP-Toyopearl column (Fig.1 B) followed by another chromatographic step on a IDA-Cu+2 column (Fig. 1 C), leading to co-isolation of the 37- and 32-kDa polypeptides (Fig. 1 D). The polypeptides were then blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and sequenced separately by automated Edman degradation (Fig. 3 A). After the 19th amino acid, the sequence of the 37-kDa polypeptide became identical to that of the 32-kDa polypeptide, indicating both are in fact different proteolytic states of the same protein (Fig.3 B). Gel filtration chromatography on a Superose 12 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column showed a single peak of approximately 35 kDa (data not shown), excluding the possibility that these two polypeptides were subunits of an oligomeric protein.Figure 2Binding of THAP to hemin-agarose gel. 30 μg of protein from the first DEAE peak were incubated with the hemin-agarose gel in the absence or presence of hemin.

Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acid Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55720) Google Scholar) primer to clone THAP from total ovary RNA. When translated, the resultant clone presents an amino-terminal sequence identical to the 50-amino acid sequence obtained by overlapping the two segments deduced from the Edman procedure. The cDNA encodes a protein of 353 amino acids (38,313 Da) with a pI of 7.16 (Fig. 3 C). Proteins showing the closest identities with THAP were cathepsin D from several organisms (40–44% identity) and an aspartic proteinase of the mosquito Aedes aegypti (45% identity), and accordingly, we consider that this enzyme can be characterized as cathepsin D-like. Selected sequences used in this analysis are aligned with THAP in Fig. 4. When subjected to a search for known structural motifs, THAP presented several blocks characteristic of aspartic proteinases such as the active site regions and the characteristic cysteines at conserved positions (Figs. 3 C and 4). We previously described another aspartic proteinase, also isolated from Boophilus eggs, called BYC (10Logullo C. Vaz Jr., I.S. Sorgine M.H.F. Paiva e Silva G.O. Faria F.S. Zingali B.R. Lima M.F.R. Masuda H. Gonzales J.C. Masuda A. Oliveira P.L. Parasitology. 1998; 116: 525-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, none of BYC sequences were identified in THAP cDNA, confirming that BYC and THAP are in fact different proteins. When THAP proteolytic activity against hemoglobin was evaluated, it showed an optimal pH of 3.5 (data not shown) and was specifically inhibited by pepstatin, a selective inhibitor of this group of enzymes, but not by inhibitors of other classes of proteinase (TableI). THAP was also assayed against several different synthetic fluorogenic and chromogenic substrates. Substrates for the main classes of acidic proteinases (cathepsin L, cathepsin B, cathepsin G, and cathepsin D) were assayed (27Mendiola J. Alonso M. Marquetti M.C. Finlay C. Exp.

The binding of THAP to hemin-agarose (Fig. 2) was a strong indication of the presence of a heme-binding site in this protein. Titration of THAP with hemin showed that each THAP molecule is capable of binding a single molecule of hemin (Fig.5 A) with aK d of 190 nm (Fig. 5 B). To determine whether the binding of heme would affect THAP activity, we followed Abz-AIAFFSRQ-EDDnp hydrolysis in the presence of heme. The addition of heme in a 1:1 or 2:1 heme-to-THAP ratio did not affect itsK m or V max, indicating that heme interferes neither in the binding of the substrate to the active site nor in the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme (Fig.6).Figure 6Hydrolysis of Abz-AIAFFSRQ-EDDnp by THAP. THAP (10 μg) was incubated in 100 μl of 0.2m sodium acetate buffer, pH 3.5, at 37 °C for 40 min with different concentrations of the fluorogenic substrate and the indicated heme:THAP ratios. A nonlinear least-squares fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation is shown by the solid line. A double-reciprocal plot is shown in the inset. Error bars indicate S.E. for three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) A completely different result was obtained when hemoglobin hydrolysis was investigated. ApoHb produced after removal of the heme prosthetic group was a poor substrate for THAP, but the hydrolysis was greatly increased upon hemoglobin reconstitution by addition of hemin (Fig.7 A). Stimulation of the activity was maximal at 1:1 globin-to-heme ratio. This observation could mean that the binding of heme induced a conformational shift in the globin molecule leading to exposure of susceptible peptide bonds. This did not seem to be the case, as increasing the heme-to-globin ratio to 1.2:1 resulted in strong inhibition of hemoglobin hydrolysis (Fig. 7 A). The same experiment using ribonuclease A instead of globin did not show any effect of heme on THAP proteolytic activity (Fig. 7 B). These data may be explained by THAP using heme (bound to a protein) as a docking site, with the bound heme increasing the affinity of THAP toward the protein substrate. For the same reason, after the saturation of globin heme-binding sites, the addition of free hemin to the reaction medium would competitively inhibit docking of THAP to the substrate by occupying the THAP heme-binding site. Since VTs from ticks are hemeproteins (13Roosell R. Coons L.B. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1991; 21: 871-885Google Scholar), we carried out experiments to verify whether or not heme would be able to modulate THAP proteolytic activity against VT. Similarly to the result obtained with hemoglobin, hydrolysis of VT by THAP was inhibited by the presence of free heme in the reaction medium (Fig.8). This suggests that free heme can compete with heme bound to VT (13Roosell R. Coons L.B. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1991; 21: 871-885Google Scholar) for the heme-binding site of THAP. Further support for this hypothesis is provided by comparing binding of THAP to different substrates (Fig. 9). Pepstatin-treated THAP was incubated with a nitrocellulose sheet blotted with Hb, apoHb, VT, or ribonuclease A, and binding of THAP was revealed using polyclonal anti-THAP antibodies. THAP was able to bind to hemoglobin and VT but not to apoHb or to ribonuclease A (Fig. 7). Moreover, the binding to VT and Hb was blocked by hemin or Hb added to the incubation media but not by ribonuclease A.Figure 9Dot blot assay of THAP binding to protein substrates. 2 μg of each protein (VT, Boophilusvitellin; Hb, hemoglobin; apoHb, apohemoglobin; RNaseA, ribonuclease A) was dotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane.

We previously showed that CD44 expressed in cancer cells is proteolytically cleaved at the ectodomain through membrane-anchored metalloproteases and that CD44 cleavage plays a critical role in cancer cell migration. Therefore, cellular signals that promote the migration and metastatic activity of cancer cells may regulate the CD44 ectodomain cleavage. Here, we demonstrate that the expression of the dominant active mutant of Ha-Ras (Ha-RasVal-12) induces redistribution of CD44 to the newly generated membrane ruffling area and CD44 ectodomain cleavage. The migration assay revealed that the CD44 cleavage contributes to the Ha-RasVal-12-induced migration of NIH3T3 cells on hyaluronate substrate. Treatment with LY294002, an inhibitor for phosphoinositide 3-OH kinase (PI3K), significantly inhibits Ha-RasVal-12-induced CD44 cleavage, whereas that with PD98059, an inhibitor for MEK, does not. The active mutant p110 subunit of PI3K has also been shown to enhance the CD44 cleavage, suggesting that PI3K mediates the Ras-induced CD44 cleavage. Moreover, the expression of dominant negative mutants of Cdc42 and Rac1 inhibits the Ha-RasVal-12-induced CD44 cleavage. These results suggest that Ras > PI3K > Cdc42/Rac1 pathway plays an important role in CD44 cleavage and may provide a novel molecular basis to explain how the activated Ras facilitates cancer cell migration.

The cleavage was found to play a crucial role in an efficient cell detachment from a hyaluronate substrate during the cell migration and to promote the CD44-mediated cell migration of cancer cells (8Okamoto I.

These results led us to speculate that cellular signals activated in the cancer cells having high motility and migration activity may contribute to the regulation of CD44 cleavage. Stimulations by various growth factors and ECM proteins are known to activate locomotion of tumor cells, which contributes to invasion and metastasis of the cells (9Wells A. Adv.

Ras small GTPases (Ha-Ras, Ki-Ras, and N-Ras) are indispensable for such cellular signaling. Signals from the growth factor-dependent activation of receptor tyrosine kinase or the integrin-dependent cell adhesion to ECM induce the activation and/or membrane recruitment of guanine nucleotide exchange factors, which convert inactive GDP-bound Ras into active GTP-bound Ras (11Gu J. Tamura M. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1375-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar).

Several lines of evidence suggest the involvement of Ras activation in cell motility and migration. First, Ras-transformed NIH3T3 cells exhibited metastatic behavior in vivo (24Thorgeirsson U.P. Turpeenniemi-Hujanen T. Williams J.E. Westin E.H. Heilman C.A. Talmadge J.E. Liotta L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 259-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 25Bondy G.P. Wilson S.

Second, microinjection of cells with a dominant negative mutant of Ras or neutralizing antibody against Ras inhibited the growth factor-induced cell migration (26Fox P.L. Sa G. Dobrowolski S.F. Stacey D.W. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3519-3526PubMed Google Scholar). Third, microinjection of an active mutant of Ras induced marked alteration in the actin cytoskeleton organization, which is essential for cell movement (27Bar-Sagi D. Feramisco J.R.

It has also been reported that the active form of Ras induces PI3K activation (39Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Khwaja A. Marte B.M. Pappin D. Das P. Waterfield M.D. Ridley A. Downward J.

Cdc42 also was thought to be involved in Ras-induced cytoskeletal reorganization since its dominant negative mutant reverts transformed morphology of Ha-RasVal-12-expressing cells (30Qiu R.G. Abo A. McCormick F. Symons M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3449-3458Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). We have recently found that the Rho family of small G proteins are involved in the regulation of the subcellular distribution and cleavage of CD44 (41Okamoto I. Kawano Y. Matsumoto M. Suga M.

Therefore, we hypothesized that the downstream signaling events of Ras activation promote the cell migration by regulating CD44 cleavage. In this study, we have investigated the role of activated Ha-Ras in the regulation of CD44 cleavage and the CD44-dependent cell migration. Our findings suggest that oncogenic Ras promotes the CD44-dependent cell migration on hyaluronic substrate by induction of the CD44 cleavage through PI3K and the Rho family of small G proteins, Rac and Cdc42.

Aliquots of supernatant were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with anti-Myc antibody and another 1 h of incubation after adding protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After being washed, the bound proteins were analyzed Western blot analysis. For the Western blot analysis, the cultured cells were preincubated with 10 mm MG132 for 2 h (41Okamoto I. Kawano Y.

Samples containing equal amounts of cell lysates extracted from equal numbers of cells were electrophoresed on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose filters with a constant current of 120 mA for 2 h. The filters were blocked in PBS containing 10% skim milk for 30 min at room temperature and then incubated with primary antibodies diluted in PBS containing 0.03% Tween 20 for 1 h, and washed three times for 7 min each time with PBS containing 0.3% Tween 20. The filters were then incubated for 40 min with the appropriate secondary antibodies diluted in PBS containing 0.03% Tween 20, and specific proteins were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Ha-RasVal-12-expressing NIH3T3 cells grown on 35-mm culture dishes were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/0.25% glutaraldehyde/PBS for 10 min followed by 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS for 5 min. After being washed with PBS, the cells were incubated in primary antibodies diluted in PBS containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 60 min at room temperature, washed three times in PBS, and then incubated for 60 min at room temperature with the appropriate secondary antibodies diluted in PBS containing 0.2% BSA. After washing with PBS, samples were mounted in 80% glycerol and visualized with a confocal microscope (Fluoview, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with an argon gas laser and appropriate filter sets to allow the simultaneous recording of fluorescein. Fluorescence micrographs were recorded using PL APO 40× objectives and were sampled at a resolution of 1024 × 1024 pixels and 8-bits per color. Throughout this study, we confirmed that no bleed-through occurred between different channels by comparing the results obtained by depleting one primary antibody. Cell migration was assayed using 48-well modified Boyden chambers (Neuro Probe Inc., Bethesda) with polycarbonate Nucleopore filters of 8-μm pore size (Nuclepore Corp.). The undersides of filters were precoated with 4 mg/ml hyaluronic acid (Sigma) or 10 μg/ml fibronectin (Sigma). Prior to the assays, the filters were washed in PBS and air-dried. The lower compartments of the modified Boyden chamber were filled with DMEM/F-12 containing 0.5% BSA in the presence of 5 mm IPTG or not, and the ECM-coated filters were placed into the chamber with the coated membrane side facing the lower compartments. Parental NIH3T3 cells or NIH3T3 RasValA1 cells in a logarithmic phase of growth were detached by brief exposure to trypsin-EDTA and resuspended at 106 cells/ml in DMEM/F-12 containing 0.5% BSA in the presence of 5 mm IPTG or not. These cells were added to the upper compartments at 5 × 104 cells/compartment. For studies using antibodies, the cells were incubated with 20 μg/ml KM114 or isotype-matched control Rat antibody (PharMingen) diluted in DMEM/F-12 containing 0.5% BSA in the presence of 5 mm IPTG or not 10 min prior to and during the migration assay. For studies using BB2516, the cells were incubated with 100 μm BB2516 diluted in DMEM/F-12 containing 0.5% BSA in the presence of 5 mm IPTG 10 min prior to and during the migration assay. Me2SO was used as a buffer control. Chambers were subsequently incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere for 24 h. After removal of filters, cells on the non-coated upper membrane side were gently wiped off. Filters were fixed in methanol, stained with Giemsa solution, and mounted on glass slides. Cells that had migrated to the coated side of the filters were counted in a blinded fashion using light microscopy under high power field (× 400). The number of cells in three defined high power fields was counted, and the average was determined. Each assay was performed in triplicate. Our previous study showed that CD44 is enzymatically cleaved at the ectodomain in accordance with its redistribution to membrane ruffling area, which is induced by the treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate (TPA) or expression of dominant active Rac1 (41Okamoto I.

Active mutant of Ras was demonstrated to induce membrane ruffling and lamellipodia formation (27Bar-Sagi D. Feramisco J.R. Science. 1986; 233: 1061-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 36Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3076) Google Scholar). Therefore, we first investigated the distribution of CD44 during Ras-induced cytoskeletal reorganization using confocal microscopic analysis. When we transiently transfected NIH3T3 cells with pOPRSVI-Ras(V12) plasmid which expresses the active mutant of the Harvey-Ras, Ha-RasVal-12, membrane ruffling was induced (Fig. 1, A and B). Concomitantly, CD44 was redistributed to the newly generated ruffling area (Fig. 1 C). These data indicate that the active form of Ras evokes CD44 redistribution at the plasma membrane. Next, we analyzed the CD44 cleavage activity in Ras-activated cells. For this purpose, we utilized NIH3T3 RasValA1 cells that were stably transfected with pOPRSVI-Ras(V12) and p3′SS that expresses the repressor of Escherichia colilactose operon (43Edamatsu H. Kaziro Y. Ito H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In these cells, Ha-RasVal-12 is expressed under Lac repressor control (42McCarthy S.A. Samuels M.L. Pritchard C.A. Abraham J.A. McMahon M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1953-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 43Edamatsu H. Kaziro Y. Ito H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis showed that the addition of IPTG efficiently induced expression of Ha-RasVal-12 (Fig.2 A). Expression of Ha-RasVal-12 became detectable within 4 h of treatment with IPTG, and thereafter, the level of Ras protein was continuously elevated for the duration of IPTG treatment as described previously (42McCarthy S.A. Samuels M.L. Pritchard C.A. Abraham J.A. McMahon M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1953-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 43Edamatsu H. Kaziro Y. Ito H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) (data not shown). These cells were transiently transfected with human full-length CD44s expression plasmid (hCD44s-Myc), which was epitope-tagged with Myc at the COOH terminus of CD44s. In these transfectants, as shown by Western blot analysis, the amount of the membrane-bound CD44 cleavage product was increased by the IPTG treatment for 8 h when compared with untreated cells (Fig.2 A). In contrast, parental NIH3T3 cells transfected with human CD44s-Myc alone did not induce CD44 cleavage in response to IPTG. To verify further the effect of activation of Ras on CD44 cleavage, NIH3T3 RasValA1 cells transfected with hCD44s-Myc were subjected to an ELISA to examine whether the NH2-terminal cleavage products were increased by Ha-RasVal-12 induction. Induction of the activated-Ras expression results in an increase in the release of human soluble CD44s (hsCD44s) (Fig. 2 B). Furthermore, preincubation of cells with BB2516, the hydroxamic acid-based metalloproteinase inhibitor, blocked the production of both the COOH- and NH2-terminal cleavage products (Fig. 2, Aand B). These results suggest that Ha-RasVal-12induces the metalloproteinase-mediated cleavage of CD44 at the ectodomain. Additionally, we tested the effect of Ha-RasVal-12 on the CD44 cleavage in another cell line, CHO-K1 cell. When CHO-K1 cells were transiently transfected with hCD44s-Myc, pOPRSVI-Ras(V12), and p3′SS, the amount of the membrane-bound CD44 cleavage product was increased by the treatment with IPTG (Fig. 2 C). All these results indicate that CD44 cleavage at the ectodomain is promoted by activation of Ras. We previously showed that CD44 cleavage plays a critical role in cancer cell migration on HA. In order to test whether the induction of Ha-RasVal-12 promotes the CD44-dependent cell migration, we performed modified Boyden chamber type migration assays. As shown in Fig.3 A, Ha-RasVal-12induction by IPTG treatment significantly enhanced the migration of NIH3T3 RasValA1 cells through HA-coated membrane, whereas IPTG treatment did not effect the migration of parental NIH3T3 cells on HA. Furthermore, anti-CD44ecto monoclonal antibody significantly inhibited the Ha-RasVal-12-induced migration on HA compared with an isotype-matched control monoclonal antibody. In contrast, anti-CD44ecto monoclonal antibody did not reduce Ha- RasVal-12-induced migration of NIH3T3"

Aside from its lipolytic activity, LpL promotes lipoprotein uptake by increasing the association of these particles with cell surfaces allowing for the internalization by receptors and proteoglycans. Recent studies also indicate that LpL stimulates selective uptake of lipids from high density lipoprotein (HDL) and very low density lipoprotein. To study whether LpL can mediate selective uptake of lipids from low density lipoprotein (LDL), LpL was incubated with LDL receptor negative fibroblasts, and the uptake of LDL protein, labeled with 125I, and cholesteryl esters traced with [3H]cholesteryl oleoyl ether, was compared. LpL mediated greater uptake of [3H]cholesteryl oleoyl ether than 125I-LDL protein, a result that indicated selective lipid uptake. Lipid enrichment of cells was confirmed by measuring cellular cholesterol mass. LpL-mediated LDL selective uptake was not affected by the LpL inhibitor tetrahydrolipstatin but was nearly abolished by heparin, monoclonal anti-LpL antibodies, or chlorate treatment of cells and was not found using proteoglycan-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cells. Selective uptake from HDL, but not LDL, was 2–3-fold greater in scavenger receptor class B type I overexpressing cells (SR-BI cells) than compared control cells. LpL, however, induced similar increases in selective uptake from LDL and HDL in either control or SR-BI cells, indicative of the SR-BI-independent pathway. This was further supported by ability of LpL to promote selective uptake from LDL in human embryonal kidney 293 cells, cells that do not express SR-BI. In Chinese hamster ovary cell lines that overexpress LpL, we also found that selective uptake from LDL was induced by both endogenous and exogenous LpL. Transgenic mice that overexpress human LpL via a muscle creatine kinase promoter had more LDL selective uptake in muscle than did wild type mice. In summary LpL stimulates selective uptake of cholesteryl esters from LDL via pathways that are distinct from SR-BI. Moreover this process also occurs in vivo in tissues where abundant LpL is present.

LpL-mediated bridging of cell surface proteoglycans and lipoproteins might lead to other metabolic processes. Cells obtain lipoprotein lipids via a process, selective uptake, in which cholesteryl esters from the lipoprotein core are taken up by cells without concomitant uptake of whole lipoprotein particles. LpL could also be involved in this process (13Rinninger F. Kaiser T. Mann W.A. Meyer N. Greten H. Beisiegel U. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1335-1348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Panzenboeck U. Wintersberger A. Levak-Frank S. Zimmermann R. Zechner R. Kostner G.M. Malle E. Sattler W. J.

LDL selective uptake was observed in mice, and among the sites of selective uptake of LDL lipid were tissues that express abundant LpL such as muscle, heart, and adipose (15Green S.R. Pittman R.C. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 667-678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, selective HDL cholesteryl ester uptake occurs predominantly in steroidogenic tissues and liver (15Green S.R. Pittman R.C. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 667-678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), tissues that are rich in scavenger receptor class B type 1 (SR-BI). There are no available data that directly show LpL-mediated LDL selective uptake. In the current studies, we examined pathways involved in LpL-mediated selective uptake of LDL lipids. The role of SR-BI in this process was specifically examined using CHO cells that overexpress SR-BI. In addition, we tested whether endogenously synthesized LpL has similar effects on LDL selective uptake as exogenous LpL, using CHO cells that overexpress LpL. Finally the importance of LpL in this process was studied in vivo using mice that overexpress LpL in muscle. Our data show that LpL-mediated LDL selective uptake is independent of SR-BI but requires cell surface proteoglycans. Sodium [125I]iodide (NEZ033) was purchased from NEN Life Science Products.

Fetal bovine serum was purchased from Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, VT. Lipoprotein-deficient serum (LPDS) was prepared from fetal bovine serum by sequential density gradient ultracentrifugation (d > 1.225 g/ml) followed by extensive dialysis against saline containing 1 mg/ml EDTA, pH 7.4. Isolated LPDS was filter-sterilized using a 0.45-μm filter and stored frozen at −20 °C.

LDL and HDL were isolated from normolipidemic human plasma by sequential ultracentrifugation at 1.025 < d < 1.060 (LDL) and 1.080 < d < 1.210 g/ml (HDL) for 20 and 48 h (22Rumsey S.C. Galeano N.F. Arad Y. Deckelbaum R.J. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 1551-1561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Isolated LDL was labeled with [3H]cholesteryl oleoyl ether ([3H]CEt) by methods described by Thomas and Rudel (23Thomas M.S. Rudel L.L. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 130: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Briefly, a glass tube was evenly coated with 100 μCi of [3H]CEt dissolved in 500 μl of dichloromethane by evaporation under a nitrogen stream. One ml of LDL (8–10 mg) was mixed with 5 ml of plasma as a source of cholesteryl ester transfer protein obtained from a normolipidemic human subject. The mixture was then incubated for 24 h at 37 °C to allow labeling of LDL followed by re-isolation of LDL by methods described above. Immediately after isolation, LDL was labeled with either 125I using iodine monochloride (24Bilheimer D.W. Eisenberg S. Levy R.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 260: 212-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (1185) Google Scholar) or coupled with 125I-labeled tyramine cellobiose (TC). 125I-TC was prepared by using 1,3,4,6-tetrachloro-3α,6α-diphenylglycouril (Iodogen) (0.06–0.1 mCi/nmol TC) (25Fraker P.J.

Carew T.E. Arteriosclerosis. 1989; 9: 895-907Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HDL was labeled with125I using the iodine monochloride method. Labeled LDL and HDL were dialyzed extensively against saline containing 1 mg/ml EDTA, sterilized by filtration through an Acrodisc (0.45 μm), stored at 4 °C, and used within 1 week. LDL and HDL cholesterol masses were measured with gas liquid chromatography (GLC) using β-sitosterol as an internal standard using the method of Ishikawa et al. (28Ishikawa T. MacGee J. Morrison J.A. Glueck C.J. J. Lipid Res. 1974; 15: 286-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein was measured by the method of Lowry et al. (29Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standards. The calculated cholesterol to protein ratios of LDL and HDL ranged from 1.6 to 1.8 (n > 20) and 0.2 to 0.5 (n > 6), respectively. More than 80% of total cholesterol was accounted for by cholesteryl esters in HDL and LDL. [3H]CEt/125I-LDL and 125I-HDL were used for in vitro experiments, whereas [3H]CEt/125I-TC-LDL was used in in vivo mouse experiments. LDL receptor negative GM2000 human fibroblasts and SR-BI-deficient kidney embryonal 293 cells (30Lambert G. Chase M.B. Dugi K. Bensadoun A. Brewer Jr., H.B. Santamarina-Fojo S. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1294-1303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) obtained from American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, were plated and grown near confluency in either 16- or 35-mm dishes and maintained in culture in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum, vitamins, glucose,l-glutamine, and antibiotics as described previously (31Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1976; 9: 663-674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Two days before each experiment, culture medium was replaced with DMEM containing LPDS and incubated at 37 °C to deplete cholesterol from cells. CHO cells overexpressing murine SR-BI (32Ji Y. Jian B. Wang N. Sun Y. de la Llena Moya M. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. Swaney J.B. Tall A.R. J. Biol.

This cell line and a control CHO cell line that was transfected with an identical plasmid but without a SR-BI gene (denoted Vec cells) were grown in F12 medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum, vitamins, glucose,l-glutamine, antibiotics, and 300 μg/ml G418. CHO cells that overexpress LpL (33Sendak R.A. Bensadoun A. J.

Wild type CHO cells and CHO cells that lack glycosaminoglycan synthesis (34Esko J.D. Weinke J.L. Taylor W.H. Ekborg G. Roden L. Anantharamaiah G. Gawish A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12189-12195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (PG-) were grown in culture with identical growth medium as Vec and SR-BI cells except there was no G418 added. Two days before the experiments, cells were grown in F12 medium containing 10% LPDS with all supplements except G418. Cells were incubated with 100 μg/ml double-labeled LDL in DMEM containing 1% bovine serum albumin in the presence or absence of 100 nmLpL for 4–8 h at 37 °C. In some experiments, cells were first treated with 50 mm NaClO3 to inhibit the sulfation of glycosaminoglycan chains on proteoglycans as described (12Seo T. St. Clair R.W. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 765-779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To eliminate the actions of classical lipoprotein receptors, Ca2+ was chelated by adding 0.5 mm EDTA to the medium. At the end of the experiments, cells were washed and solubilized in 0.1 n NaOH to determine cell-associated [3H]CEt and 125I. Cell protein was measured using a kit from Bio-Rad. LDL apoB degradation was determined from culture medium by measurement of 10% trichloroacetic acid-soluble noniodide 125I as described (35Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar). Cell-associated and -degraded 125I-apoB were added to show total cell apoB metabolism, and values were used to calculate cholesterol delivery to cells from internalized LDL using cholesterol to protein ratios of the experimental LDL. Generally all experiments were carried out three or more separate times and showed consistent results. Cells were washed and cellular lipids were extracted overnight at room temperature by incubation with isopropanol containing a known amount of β-sitosterol as an internal standard. Extracted lipids were analyzed for free cholesterol and cholesteryl esters using GLC (12Seo T. St. Clair R.W. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 765-779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Net cholesterol mass delivery was determined by subtracting cholesterol content in cells that were incubated with medium alone from that of cells incubated with LDL ± LpL. To determine selective uptake, estimated cholesterol mass delivery based on 125I counts and LDL cholesterol/protein ratios was subtracted from net cholesterol delivery determined by GLC. MCK-LpL mice and littermates with no human LpL expression (B57BL/6 background) weighing 27–35 g were used for in vivo studies. 200 μg of LDL labeled with [3H]CEt and 125I-TC tracers was injected via tail vein, and the mice were kept for 24 h with normal feeding. At the end of the experiments, mice were anesthetized and exsanguinated, and the organs were thoroughly perfused with 20 ml of phosphate buffered-saline containing 1 mg/ml EDTA and 100 IU/ml heparin. Isolated organs were quickly rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, weighed, and solubilized in 2 ml of 5 n NaOH for 48 h followed by separation of lipids and protein by the method of Dole (36Dole V.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1956; 35: 150-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (1597) Google Scholar). The upper organic solvent phase contained [3H]CEt with less than 5% 125I contamination. The solvent phase was then dried under a nitrogen stream and counted for [3H] with a Wallac model 4909 scintillation counter. Two ml of the bottom layer was transferred to a tube for 125I counts. Large organs such as liver were solubilized as described and diluted 10-fold before proceeding to phase separation. Two-tailed paired student's t tests were performed to determine statistical significance of all in vitro studies. In vivo studies were analyzed using two-tailed student's t tests within the group, whereas the noncomparative student's t test assuming equal variance was utilized to determine the statistical significance between groups. To test whether LpL stimulates LDL selective uptake in LDL receptor negative fibroblasts, double-labeled LDL was incubated in the presence or absence of LpL for 4 and 8 h at 37 °C. TableI summarizes the effect of LpL on selective uptake from LDL at two different time points. After 4 h LpL increased cholesteryl ester and apoB uptake >2-fold. Greater than 90% of both labels was not heparin releasable (100 IU/ml phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min at 4 °C, data not shown), indicating that most label was either cell-associated or degraded. The enhanced uptake of LDL was time-dependent; an 8-h incubation of LDL resulted in 1.2–1.5-fold more of both [3H]CEt and 125I-apoB uptake than that found at 4 h. When selective uptake was determined by measuring the difference in cholesteryl ester uptake calculated from [3H]CEt and 125I-apoB, LpL increased selective uptake by 3–4-fold at both 4 and 8 h. This should have led to a net increase in cellular cholesterol mass.Table IUptake of cholesterol from double-labeled LDL in LDL receptor negative human fibroblastsCholesterol delivery calculated fromSelective uptake[3H]CEt125I-apoBMass[3H]CEt-125I-apoBμg C/mg Pμg/mgl4-h IncubationLDL14.08 ± 3.806.22 ± 0.210.40 ± 0.807.86LDL + LpL42.32 ± 8.60*11.89 ± 1.9038.75 ± 5.2030.438-h IncubationLDL24.54 ± 0.728.64 ± 0.87ND15.9LDL + LpL59.24 ± 1.43*14.08 ± 0.44ND45.16Cells were incubated with [3H]CEt/125I-labeled human LDL as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cell-associated and degraded 125I counts were added to calculate predicted cholesterol delivery based on the cholesterol to protein ratio of each LDL. 3H counts and specific activity were used to calculate cholesteryl ester uptake.

To confirm that LpL increased net uptake of cholesterol, cellular cholesterol was measured by GLC after a 4-h incubation. Cells incubated with LDL alone had a cholesterol level of 16.53 ± 0.82 μg/mg cell protein, and no significant cholesteryl ester accumulation was observed in the absence of LpL, accounting for less than 5% of total cholesterol. The addition of LpL increased net cellular cholesterol mass to a level very similar to that calculated from [3H]CEt uptake; cholesterol mass was 38.75 ± 5.20 μg in control cells and 42.32 ± 8.60 μg of cholesterol/mg of cell protein in LpL-treated cells. More than 95% of this increase was because of cholesteryl ester, whereas cellular-free cholesterol remained unchanged. Thus, the mass data confirm true cholesterol net transfer and not just exchange of radiolabel. Free fatty acids stimulate LDL uptake in cultured cells (37Rumsey S.C. Galeano N.F. Lipschitz B. Deckelbaum R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10008-10016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Although LDL has few triglycerides, it is possible that liberated fatty acids and/or lysophospholipids from hydrolysis of LDL triglyceride or phospholipid (38Deckelbaum R.J. Ramakrishnan R. Eisenberg S. Olivecrona T. Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8544-8551Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) by LpL promoted selective uptake. To assess this possibility, cells were incubated with LDL and LpL in the presence or absence of THL. THL is a potent inhibitor of LpL catalytic activity, and the concentration used in the study (100 μm) almost totally inhibits LpL-mediated lipolysis of triglyceride-rich particles (39Lookene A. Skottova N. Olivecrona G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 395-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In the presence of LpL, THL did not affect either [3H]CEt or 125I-apoB uptake, and therefore, did not change selective uptake (Fig. 1). Thus, the effect of LpL on selective uptake is not dependent upon its catalytic activity. We next determined if impairing LpL binding to lipoproteins inhibits LpL-mediated LDL selective uptake. Cells were incubated with LDL and LpL in the presence of monoclonal antihuman LpL antibodies that inhibit the association of LpL with LDL particles (19Goldberg I.J. Paterniti Jr., J.R. France D.S. Martinelli G. Cornicelli J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 878: 168-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In the absence of antibodies, ∼40 μg/mg cell protein cholesteryl ester were delivered via selective uptake (Fig.2). Antihuman LpL antibodies reduced selective uptake by ∼80%. Incubation of irrelevant antihuman IgG did not inhibit selective uptake (data not shown), indicating binding of LpL to LDL particles is required for subsequent selective uptake. The role of cell surface proteoglycans was examined by several methods. Heparin inhibits binding of LDL·LpL complexes to cell surface proteoglycans. Incubation of heparin with LDL and LpL inhibited LDL selective uptake by fibroblasts >90%. Treating cells with sodium chlorate removes glycosaminoglycan chains from cell surface proteoglycans. Chlorate incubation nearly abolished the LpL-mediated LDL selective uptake (Fig. 2). To discriminate between the effect of proteoglycans as compared with classical lipoprotein receptors in LpL-mediated selective uptake, studies were performed in the presence or absence of Ca2+. Depletion of Ca2+ does not affect particle binding to cell surface proteoglycans (12Seo T. St. Clair R.W. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 765-779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The absence of Ca2+ had no effect on LpL-stimulated selective uptake from LDL (Fig. 2,inset). The role of cell surface proteoglycans was further assessed with CHO cells void of cell surface proteoglycans (PG-). Basal LDL uptake was very similar to control cells, but incubation with LpL stimulated significantly less total LDL uptake. Furthermore there was no LpL-mediated selective uptake in this cell line (Fig.3). Thus, selective uptake from LDL requires LpL binding to LDL and binding of LDL·LpL complexes to cell surfaces via interaction with proteoglycans. LpL-mediated selective uptake is independent of Ca2+, excluding the potential role of classical receptors. However, the process may be mediated by CLA-1 (40Cao G. Garcia C.K. Wyne K.L. Schultz R.A. Parker K.L. Hobbs H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33068-33076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), the human homologue of SR-BI; model phospholipid liposomes do bind to SR-BI in the absence of Ca2+ (41Rigotti A. Acton S.L. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16221-16224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). LpL-mediated LDL selective uptake was studied in CHO cells overexpressing SR-BI (SR-BI cells). SR-BI and vector-transfected control cells (Vec) were incubated with double-labeled LDL in the presence or absence of LpL at 37 °C. The uptake of LDL [3H]CEt and 125I-apoB in SR-BI and Vec cells is summarized in Table II. SR-BI overexpression increased 125I-apoB cell association as described by others (42Swarnakar S. Temel R.E. Connelly M.A. Azhar S. Williams D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29733-29739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Thus, in the absence of LpL total LDL cholesteryl ester uptake was ∼2-fold higher in SR-BI cells compared with Vec cells; however, there was little, if any, selective uptake in either cell. The addition of LpL to the medium increased the uptake of125I-apoB and especially [3H]CEt in Vec and SR-BI cells. Both cell lines showed similar increases in LpL-mediated selective uptake with LDL, indicating LpL stimulated LDL selective uptake. As was found with fibroblasts, treatment with chlorate reduced total LDL uptake to control levels, and LpL-associated selective uptake was nearly abolished. Of note, the contribution of selective uptake to total LDL cholesterol uptake was relatively small in these cells compared with LDL receptor negative fibroblasts, presumably because most LDL was taken up by the LDL receptors on the surface of SR-BI and Vec cells. Nonetheless, these experiments demonstrate that"
https://openalex.org/W2012459434,"We have studied the molecular basis for the resistance of human CEM leukemia cells to GW1843, a thymidylate synthase inhibitor. GW1843-resistant cells displayed a ∼100-fold resistance to GW1843 and methotrexate but were collaterally sensitive to the lipophilic antifolates trimetrexate and AG337, which enter cells by diffusion. These cells exhibited a 12-fold decreased methotrexate influx but surprisingly had a 2-fold decreased folic acid growth requirement. This was associated with a 4-fold increased influx of folic acid, a 3.5-fold increased steady-state level of folic acid, and a 2.3-fold expansion of the cellular folate pool. Characterization of the transport kinetic properties revealed that GW1843-resistant cells had the following alterations: (a) 11-fold decreased transport K m for folic acid; (b) 6-fold increased transport K m for GW1843; and (c) a slightly increased transportV max for folic acid. Sequence analysis showed that GW1843-resistant cells contained the mutations Val-29 → Leu, Glu-45 → Lys, and Ser-46 → Ile in the first transmembrane domain of the reduced folate carrier. Transfection of the mutant-reduced folate carrier cDNA into methotrexate transport null cells conferred resistance to GW1843. This is the first demonstration of multiple mutations in a confined region of the human reduced folate carrier in an antifolate-resistant mutant. We conclude that certain amino acid residues in the first transmembrane domain play a key role in (anti)folate binding and in the conferring of drug resistance.

We conclude that certain amino acid residues in the first transmembrane domain play a key role in (anti)folate binding and in the conferring of drug resistance. methotrexate reduced folate carrier transmembrane domain dihydrofolate reductase thymidylate synthase folylpoly-γ-glutamate synthase glycinamide ribonucleotide transformylase (S)-2-[5-(((1,2-dihydro-3-methyl-1-oxobenzo(f)quinazoline-9-yl)methyl)amino)-1-oxo-2-isoindolinyl]-glutaric acid N-(4-(2-(-amino-4,7-dihydro-4-oxo-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-5-yl)ethyl)benzoyl]- l-glutamic acid N-[5(N-(3,4-dihydro-2-methyl-4-oxoquinazolin-6-yl-methyl)amino)2-thenyl)]-l-glutamic acid (2S)-2-{O-fluoro-p-[N-(2,7-dimethyl-4-oxo-3,4-dihydroquinazolin-6-ylmethyl)-N-(prop-2-ynyl)amino]benzamido}-4-(tetrazol-5-yl)butyric acid 5,10-dideaza-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolic acid N α-(4-amino-4-deoxypteroyl)-N δ-(hemiphthaloyl)-l-ornithine 3,4-dihydro-2-amino-6-methyl-4-oxo-5-(4-pyridylthiol)quinazoline polymerase chain reaction single strand conformational polymorphism low folate Reduced folates are essential cofactors that function as one-carbon donors necessary for the biosynthesis of purines, thymidine, and glycine (1Stokstad E.L.R.

Importantly, some mutations primarily occurring in certain predicted TMDs of the rodent and human RFC brought about a major loss of antifolate transport while differentially preserving sufficient reduced folate and folic acid uptake to support cellular growth (32Zhao R.

Over the past decade several rationally designed novel antifolates were introduced (39Jansen G. Jackman A.L. Antifolate Drugs in Cancer Therapy. Humana Press Inc, Totowa, NJ1999: 293-321Crossref Google Scholar). For example, Tomudex (Raltritrexed, ZD1694), which has been recently approved against colorectal cancer (40Cocconi G. Cunningham D. van Custem E. Francois E. Gustavsson B. van Hazel G. Kerr D. Possinger K. Hietschold S.M. J. Clin. Oncol. 1998; 16: 2943-2952Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), and GW1843, which is undergoing clinical evaluation as an anticancer drug (41Rustum Y.M. Hastrick A. Cao S. Van Hoefer U. Yin M.B. Wilke H. Seeber H. J. Clin. Oncol. 1997; 15: 389-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), are potent thymidylate synthase (TS) inhibitors (39Jansen G. Jackman A.L. Antifolate Drugs in Cancer Therapy. Humana Press Inc, Totowa, NJ1999: 293-321Crossref Google Scholar). Like other folate analogues, these antifolates enter cells via RFC, which serves as the major route of entry for folates and antifolates (39Jansen G. Jackman A.L. Antifolate Drugs in Cancer Therapy. Humana Press Inc, Totowa, NJ1999: 293-321Crossref Google Scholar). Unlike various antifolates including MTX and ZD1694, GW1843 has an unusual and bulky methyl-oxobenzo-quinazoline structure (Fig. 1). Nevertheless, GW1843 is yet the best RFC transport substrate with a K i at the submicromolar range (8Westerhof G.R. Schornagel J.H. Kathmann I. Jackman A.L. Rosowsky A. Forsch R.A. Hynes J.B. Boyle F.T. Peters G.J. Pinedo H.M. Jansen G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 459-471PubMed Google Scholar, 39Jansen G. Jackman A.L. Antifolate Drugs in Cancer Therapy. Humana Press Inc, Totowa, NJ1999: 293-321Crossref Google Scholar). Hence, we have here studied the alterations that occur in the RFC in human leukemia cells selected for resistance to GW1843. We show here for the first time the clustering of three mutations in TMD1 of the human RFC. We further demonstrate that these mutations selectively impair antifolate transport via decreased substrate affinity, while markedly augmenting folate cofactor uptake. In contrast, these mutations had little effect on antifolate and folate transport V max. Consequently, GW1843-resistant cells display expanded folate pools and exhibit a high level resistance to various antifolates. This establishes TMD1 of the human RFC as a key determinant for (anti)folate binding and as a major locus for antifolate drug resistance.

In the case of MTX, growth inhibition assays were performed in folic acid-containing medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) is defined as the drug dose at which cell growth was inhibited by 50% relative to untreated controls. EC50 is defined as the folate cofactor concentration necessary to produce 50% of maximal cell growth. High molecular weight genomic DNA was extracted from parental CEM cells and its various sublines. DNA was digested with EcoRI, fractionated by electrophoresis on 0.8% agarose gels, transferred to a Zetaprobe (Bio-Rad) nylon membrane, and UV cross-linked. RFC gene copy number was determined by Southern blot analysis using a 32P-labeled (51Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 132: 6-13Crossref Scopus (16562) Google Scholar) human RFC cDNA probe isolated from a cDNA library from CEM-7A cells (52Drori S. Sprecher H. Shemer G. Jansen G. Goldman I.D.

Total RNA was size-fractionated on 1% agarose gels containing formaldehyde, blotted onto a Zetaprobe nylon membrane, and UV cross-linked. Human RFC cDNA and β-actin cDNA (53Ponte P. Ng S.-Y. Engel J. Gunning P. Kedes L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 1687-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar) were labeled by random hexamer priming (51Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 132: 6-13Crossref Scopus (16562) Google Scholar). Southern and Northern blot hybridizations and post-hybridization washes were carried out under high stringency conditions as described previously (38Jansen G. Mauritz R. Drori S. Sprecher H.

The recombinant human RFC antiserum kindly provided by Dr. L. H. Matherly (Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute, Detroit, MI) was generated by subcloning the complete coding sequence of the human RFC into a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion vector. After transformation of Escherichia coli cells, the GST-RFC fusion proteins were purified by glutathione-Sepharose affinity chromatography. Anti-GST-RFC antiserum was raised in rabbits using the purified GST-RFC fusion protein as antigen. To quantitate the levels of RFC expression, plasma membrane vesicles were isolated in the presence of seven protease inhibitors as described previously (24Freisheim J.H. Ratnam M. McAlinden T.P. Prasad K.M.R. Williams F.E. Westerhof G.R. Schornagel J.H. Jansen G. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1992; 32: 17-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Plasma membrane proteins were resolved by electrophoresis on 10% polyacrylamide gels containing SDS and electroblotted onto a PVDF nylon membrane (Millipore). The blots were then blocked overnight at 4 °C in TBST buffer (150 mmNaCl, 0.5% Tween 20, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0) containing 5% dry milk. The blots were then reacted with an antiserum (1:1300) to human RFC for 3 h at room temperature in TBST buffer. Blots were then rinsed briefly with TBST, after which three washes each of 15 min were performed in the same buffer. The blots were then reacted with horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit antiserum (1:2500; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in TBST for 1 h at room temperature, after which enhanced chemiluminescence detection was performed according to the manufacturers' instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Genomic PCR-single strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of the six exons of the human RFC gene was undertaken as described elsewhere. 2S. Drori, Y. Kaufman, G. Jansen, M. G. Rots, L. H.

An RFC cDNA clone containing the entire coding region (hRFC1) was directionally cloned into pCDNA3(+) at theBamHI-XhoI site (Invitrogen). The various point mutations and the single nucleotide polymorphic variations were inserted in the native RFC cDNA by site-directed mutagenesis (QuickChange, Stratagene).

Cells were then immediately diluted in prewarmed serum-containing growth medium (10 ml), allowed to recover for 32 h, adjusted to 105-2 × 105 cells/ml in medium containing G418 (750 μg of active drug/ml), and then distributed into 96-well plates at approximately 2 × 104–4 × 104 cells/well. After 10–20 days of incubation at 37 °C, individual G418-resistant clones were verified microscopically, picked, and expanded for further analyses.

In both pathways, phosphorylation of a cytoplasmic segment on tyrosine generates a docking site for proteins containing Src homology 2 (SH2) and phosphotyrosine binding domains. We recently observed that phosphorylation of a threonine (Thr-753), six amino acids proximal to tyrosine 759 in β3 of the platelet specific integrin αIIbβ3, inhibits outside-in signaling through this receptor. We hypothesized that the presence of phosphothreonine 753 either renders β3 a poor substrate for tyrosine kinases or inhibits the docking capabilities of the tyrosyl-phosphorylated form of β3. The first alternative was tested by comparing the phosphorylation of β3 model peptides by the tyrosine kinase pp60c-src and we found that the presence of a phosphate group on a residue corresponding to Thr-753 did not detectably alter the kinetics of tyrosine phosphorylation. However, the presence of phosphate on this threonine inhibited the binding of Shc to tyrosyl-phosphorylated β3 peptide. The inhibitory effect of the phosphate group could be mimicked by substituting an aspartic acid for Thr-753, suggesting that a negative charge at this position modulates the binding of Shc and possibly other phosphotyrosine binding domain- and SH2-containing proteins. A survey of several protein kinases revealed that Thr-753 was avidly phosphorylated by PDK1 and Akt/PKB in vitro. These observations suggest that activation of PDK1 and/or Akt/PKB in platelets may modulate the binding activity and/or specificity of β3 for signaling molecules.

Integrins are essential for the two basic platelet responses, adhesion and aggregation, by which primary hemostasis is maintained by limiting blood loss at sites of vascular injury. During adhesion, circulating platelets anchor to subendothelial matrix proteins and matrix-absorbed proteins, while during aggregation they adhere to other platelets. These interactions depend, in part, upon the affinity of platelet integrins, such as αIIbβ3 and α2β1, for specific adhesive proteins (1Kroll M.H. Hellums J.D. McIntire L.V. Schafer A.I. Moake L.C. Blood. 1996; 88: 1525-1541Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of adhesive molecules to integrins has two consequences. One is it allows anchored platelets to withstand shear forces experienced in arteries and veins (1Kroll M.H. Hellums J.D. McIntire L.V. Schafer A.I. Moake L.C. Blood. 1996; 88: 1525-1541Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the other is it initiates intracellular biochemical processes necessary for post-adhesive and post-aggregatory events (2Shattil S.J. Kashiwagi H. Pampori N. Blood. 1998; 91: 2645-2657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms by which integrin-mediated signals are communicated to intracellular targets are partly understood. Recent studies support a model analogous to that for growth factor receptors; phosphorylation of tyrosine residues leads to the tethering of signaling molecules to receptor or non-receptor proteins, forming complexes that initiate signaling cascades (3Anderson D. Koch C.A. Grey L. Ellis C. Moran M.F. Pawson T. Science. 1990; 250: 979-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 4Van der Geer P. Hunter T. Lindberg R.A. Annu. Rev.

Growth factor responses are initiated by the binding of a ligand to specific transmembrane receptors, leading to the activation of the receptor's tyrosine kinase activity and the phosphorylation of tyrosyl residues. The phosphorylated tyrosines are recognized as part of specific sites for protein-protein interactions mediated by Src homology 2 (SH2)1 or phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domains. Examples of phosphotyrosine-targeted binding proteins include adapter proteins such as Shc and GRB2 and enzymes such as PI3-kinase and phospholipase Cγ (6Sun X.J. Crimmins D.L. Myers M.G.J. Miralpeix M. White M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7418-7428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Rozakis-Adcock M. McGlade J. Mbamalu G. Pelicci G. Daly R. Li W. Batzer A. Thomas S. Brugge J. Pelicci P.G. Schlessinger J. Pawson T. Nature. 1992; 360: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). In an analogous fashion, activation of the integrins α2β1 or αvβ3 results in the phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase on tyrosyl residues; this creates docking sites for a variety of signaling molecules that includes GRB2-SOS (a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for activating Ras) and PI3-kinase (8Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar, 9Chen H.-C. Guan J.-L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10148-10152Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). In addition, phosphorylation of the integrin itself on tyrosyl residues also may directly initiate waves of signaling (10Blystone S.D. Williams M.P. Slater S.E. Brown E.J. J. Biol.

Biol. 1992; 12: 128-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). A common feature of several integrin β subunits (β1,β3, β6, β7) is the presence of conserved tyrosine residues whose sequence context resembles that of known PTB recognition sites, NXXY (14VanderGeer P.

These sequences are necessary for the proper functioning of αIIbβ3 integrin in platelets (15Law D.A. DeGuzman F.R. Heiser P. Ministri-Madrid K. Killeen N. Phillips D.R. Nature. 1999; 401: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) and HEL cells (16Liu X.-Y. Timmons S. Lin Y.-Z. Hawiger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11819-11824Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), αvβ3 integrin in K562 cells (10Blystone S.D. Williams M.P. Slater S.E. Brown E.J. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence support a role for tyrosine phosphorylation of these sites in a biological response. The phosphorylation of β3 on tyrosine in activated platelets (11Law D.A. Nannizzi-Alaimo L. Phillips D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10811-10815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) and in αvβ3-transfected K562 cells (18Blystone S.D. Lindberg F.P. Williams M.P. McHugh K.P. Brown E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31458-31462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) correlates with the binding of these cells to specific ligands. Furthermore, phosphorylation of Tyr-747 and Tyr-759 in β3integrins has been demonstrated to generate docking sites for signaling molecules. Both Shc and GRB2 co-precipitate with synthetic peptides that model the tyrosyl-phosphorylated carboxyl-terminal tail of β3 (11Law D.A. Nannizzi-Alaimo L. Phillips D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10811-10815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), whereas co-association with GRB2 in intact cells correlates with tyrosyl phosphorylation of β3 (18Blystone S.D. Lindberg F.P. Williams M.P. McHugh K.P. Brown E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31458-31462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The presence of Tyr-747 also is necessary for other outside-in signaling events, including focal adhesion kinase and paxillin phosphorylation (19Shaffner-Reckinger E. Gouon V. Melchior C. Plancon S. Kieffer N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12623-12632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Expression of mutated forms of αIIbβ3and αvβ3 in which the cytoplasmic tyrosine residues in β3 are replaced by phenylalanines blocks outside-in signaling linked to the formation of stable platelet aggregates and clot retraction (10Blystone S.D. Williams M.P. Slater S.E. Brown E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28757-28761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 15Law D.A. DeGuzman F.R. Heiser P. Ministri-Madrid K. Killeen N. Phillips D.R. Nature. 1999; 401: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Similarly, mutating these tyrosine residues in β1 integrins results in decreased migration of cells upon vitronectin, fibronectin, and laminin matrices (17Sakai T. Zhang Q. Fassler R. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In light of the aforementioned parallels between growth factor receptor signaling and signaling through integrins, similar mechanisms may participate in regulating their activities. Signaling by many growth factors is attenuated by the phosphorylation of their cognate receptors on serine and threonine residues by several protein kinases, including PKC and MAP kinases (4Van der Geer P. Hunter T. Lindberg R.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 251-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar). Recently, we reported that β3 is stoichiometrically phosphorylated on Thr-753 following treatment of platelets with calyculin A, a membrane-permeable inhibitor of protein serine/threonine phosphatases (20Lerea K.M. Cordero K.P. Sakariassen K.S. Kirk R.I. Fried V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1914-1919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, this treatment also inhibits outside-in signaling events. Thr-753 is located within the stretch of residues that separates the two PTB recognition sites in β3, and is immediately adjacent to a serine residue that is mutated to proline in a variant of Glazmann's thrombasthenia (21Chen Y.-P. Djaffar I. Pidard D. Steiner B. Cieutat A.-M. Caen J.P. Rosa J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10169-10173Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). A consequence of this mutation is decreased outside-in signaling through β3-containing integrins, implying that this region of the molecule plays a regulatory role. The phosphorylation of β3 on Thr-753 may inhibit outside-in signaling events by preventing the tyrosine kinases from phosphorylating β3 or, alternately, by interfering with the binding of signaling molecules to tyrosyl-phosphorylated β3. Here we report that threonine phosphorylation of β3 on residue 753 blocks recruitment of Shc, suggesting that threonine phosphorylation of β3 may be an important modulator of integrin function in vivo. Moreover, Thr-753 exists in a consensus sequence for phospholipid-dependent kinases (PDKs), raising the possibility that calyculin A-induced phosphorylation of β3 is via the Akt/PKB pathway. Calyculin A treatment of platelets, as well as treatment with a variety of agonists, leads to increased Akt/PKB activation, providing a physiological role for this phosphorylation event in the cascade of events involved in platelet responses. Prostaglandin E1, apyrases, aprotinin, leupeptin, benzamidine, Nonidet P-40, EDTA, avidin-Sepharose, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, sodium vanadate, PKA catalytic subunit, kemptide, histones (type IIIs), myelin basic protein, casein (dephospho-form), phosphatidylserine, and dithiothreitol were obtained from Sigma. 1,2-Dioleoylglycerol was purchased from Avanti. [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Alexis Corp. supplied calyculin A. Acrylamide, N′,N′-methylene bisacrylamide, HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, and mouse IgG antiserum were purchased from Bio-Rad. Biotinylated and non-biotinylated peptides were synthesized by Genosystems (Woodlands, TX). PKC, cdc2, active PDK1, Akt/PKB, Akt/PKB substrate peptide, and pp60c-src were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Amersham Pharmacia Biotech supplied the enhanced chemiluminescence assay kit. Anti-Shc antiserum and anti-Akt/PKB antiserum against the inactivated and activated phospho-forms were purchased from Transduction Laboratories. Anti-β3 polyclonal antiserum (E8) was a gift from Dr. David Phillips and Dr. Debbie Law (COR Therapeutics, San Francisco, CA) and purified casein kinase 2 was provided by Dr. Dave Litchfield (University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario, Canada). Human thrombin was supplied by Dr. Walter Kisiel (University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM). Human blood (10 parts) was drawn into acid/citrate/dextrose (1 part). Platelet-rich plasma was obtained after centrifugation at 210 × g for 10 min at 21 °C. Following addition of prostaglandin E1 (0.4 μm) and apyrases (10 milliunits/ml), platelets were isolated as described previously (20Lerea K.M. Cordero K.P. Sakariassen K.S. Kirk R.I. Fried V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1914-1919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and suspended in a modified Tyrode's buffer containing 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm KCl, 5.5 mm glucose, and 12 mmNaHCO3 at concentration of 0.5–2 × 109/ml. Peptide precipitations were conducted as described by Law et al. (11Law D.A. Nannizzi-Alaimo L. Phillips D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10811-10815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). In brief, lysates, prepared by solubilizing nonstimulated platelets (1 × 109/ml) with 1% Nonidet P-40, 140 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μm leupeptin, and 0.15 units/ml aprotinin were incubated with biotinylated peptides (10 μm) for 90 min at 4 °C. Three peptides were used for these studies: a monotyrosyl-phosphorylated peptide (biotin-748KEATSTFTNIT(pY)RGT; peptide 1), a doubly threonyl/tyrosyl-phosphorylated peptide (biotin-748KEATS(pT)FTNIT(pY)RGT; peptide 2), and a peptide in which an aspartic acid replaced Thr-753 in the monotyrosyl-phosphorylated peptide (biotin-748KEATS(D)FTNIT(pY)RGT; peptide 3). Following addition of avidin-Sepharose, proteins, complexed to each peptide, were separated by PAGE using 10% acrylamide gels and Shc identified by Western analysis. The effect of phosphorylated Thr-753 on phosphorylation of Tyr-759 was assessed by measuring the phosphorylation of synthetic peptides by preparations of active pp60c-src . Kinase assays were conducted by incubating 1 unit of pp60c-src in a mixture containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 10 mmMgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 75 μm[γ-32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products, 1 cpm/fmol), and varying concentrations of non-phosphorylated β3 peptide (RR746LFKEATSTFTNITYR; peptide 1), or the threonine-phosphorylated form of the synthetic peptide (RR746LFKEATS(pT)FTNITYR; peptide 2). Identical results were obtained using peptides that contained Tyr-747. Although two tandem arginine residues were added to the NH2-terminal end of each peptide, they failed to bind phosphocellulose filter papers. Thus, 32P incorporation into peptides was quantified by an SDS-PAGE-based method. Reactions were quenched by the addition of SDS gel buffer and peptides separated from [γ-32P]ATP by electrophoresis on 20% acrylamide gels (bisacrylamide:acrylamide, 1:32). For Lineweaver-Burk analysis, reactions incubated for 30 min. Phosphorylated peptides were visualized by autoradiography and radioactivity incorporated determined by Cerenkov counting of excised peptide bands. Prior to these studies, peptides were suspended in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, and concentrations of stock peptide solutions were determined using the Pierce BCA protein assay system and γ-globulin as the standard. The data were plotted in a linear form using Lineweaver-Burk reciprocal plots (shown in Fig. 1), Hanes-Woolf plots (data not shown), or Eadie-Scatchard plots (data not shown). Linear regression analysis was conducted using Slide Write Plus (Advanced Graphics Software, Encinitas, CA) or Fig P software (Biosoft, Ferguson, MO). The ability of various serine/threonine protein kinases to phosphorylate Thr-753 was determined using the following synthetic peptides: RR746LYKEATS(753T)FTNITYR (peptide 1), RR746LYKEATS(pT)FTNITYR (peptide 2), and RR746LYKEAAA(753T)FANIAYR (peptide 3). Standard kinase assays were conducted using 0.5 mmpeptide and concentrations of enzyme recommended by the source: PKA (1 unit/reaction), PKC (25 ng/reaction), cdc2 (25 ng/reaction), Akt/PKB (25 ng/reaction), PDK1 (10 ng/reaction), and casein kinase 2 (1:100 dilution). PKC reactions were conducted in the presence of diacylglycerol (0.05 mg/ml) and phosphatidylserine (0.5 mg/ml). PDK reactions were conducted using an active enzyme in the absence of added lipid cofactors. Reactions proceeded at 30 °C for varying amounts of time and quenched by adding SDS gel buffer. Peptides were separated using 20% PAGE and visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue R-250. Peptides were excised from wet gels and the amount of 32P incorporated assessed using an LKB scintillation counter. For kinetic analysis, the amount of peptide 1 ranged from 1 μm to 0.5 mm. As control, filter paper assays were conducted using proteins or synthetic peptides known to be substrates for each enzyme (kemptide (0.1 μm), PKA; histones (1 mg/ml) and myelin basic protein (1 mg/ml), PKC and cdc2; casein (5 mg/ml), casein kinase 2; Akt/PKB peptide substrate (100 μm), Akt/PKB). 300 microliters of a platelet suspension (0.5 × 109 platelets) were treated with buffer, collagen (5 μg/ml), PMA (0.25 μm), thrombin (0.2 units/ml), or calyculin A (0.1 μm) for 2 min at 37 °C while stirring at 800 rpm in a Chronolog Lumiaggregometer. Reactions were quenched by the addition of SDS-PAGE gel buffer, and the samples were heated at 100 °C for 2 min and subjected to SDS-PAGE. In some cases, platelets were treated with wortmannin (25 or 500 nm) prior to the addition of agonists. Platelet proteins associated with biotinylated β3 peptides and those from detergent-solubilized cells were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels followed by transfer to nitrocellulose membranes for 1 h at 100 V. Membranes were blocked with Tween 20-containing Tris-buffered saline containing 5% nonfat dried milk and incubated overnight at 4 °C with a polyclonal anti-Shc antibody (1:1000), a monoclonal anti-Akt/PKB antibody (1:1000) against the nonactive form of the enzyme, or a polyclonal anti-phospho-Akt/PKB antibody (1:1000). Following incubation with an HRP-coupled secondary antibody (HRP-labeled goat anti-rabbit or mouse IgG), the membranes were developed using an ECL detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To quantitate relative changes in reactivity, densitometry measurements were attained using an IS-1000 Digital Imaging System from Alpha Innotech Corp. (San Leandro, CA). Using synthetic peptides modeled after residues 746–760 of β3, LFKEATSTFTNITYR, we explored the hypothesis that phosphorylation of Thr-753 in the integrin β3 modulates the effect of phosphorylation at Tyr-759. Prior studies showed that pp60c-src phosphorylates tyrosine residues in β3 (11Law D.A. Nannizzi-Alaimo L. Phillips D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10811-10815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.1, pp60c-src phosphorylates a β3 peptide with indistinguishable kinetic parameters (Fig. 1, B and C) regardless of whether the residue corresponding to Thr-753 is phosphorylated or not. Independent mathematical transformations of the data were used to compare the V max and K mvalues of pp60c-src and the parameters obtained were similar for both peptides. The V max values of pp60c-src phosphorylating the non-phosphorylated and threonine-phosphorylated peptides were 44 ± 11 and 34 ± 3 fmol of phosphate incorporated/min (mean ± S.E., n = 3), respectively. The apparentK m values for peptide 1 were calculated to be 68 ± 20 and 113 ± 7 μm (mean ± S.E.,n = 8) using Lineweaver-Burk (Fig. 1 C) and Hanes-Woolf (data not shown) plots, respectively. Similarly, theK m values for peptide 2 are 48 ± 16 and 118 ± 13 μm (means ± S.E., n= 8) using these plots, respectively. Thus, these experiments suggest that threonine phosphorylation of β3 does not appear to influence subsequent phosphorylation of β3 on tyrosine. We next asked whether phosphorylation at Thr-753 affected the binding of phosphotyrosine-759 to other signaling partners. To address this, binding studies were performed using biotinylated peptides that contain either a single phosphorylated residue (Tyr(P)-759) or two phosphorylated residues (Thr(P)-753 and Tyr(P)-759) (Fig.2 A). Platelets contain three isoforms of the binding partner Shc with molecular masses of 64, 52, and 46 kDa that are present in a ratio of 1:10:3, respectively. When a platelet lysate was incubated with avidin-Sepharose and the peptide containing phosphorylated Tyr-759, both the 52- and 46-kDa isoforms bound. In contrast, when a peptide that was phosphorylated on both Thr-753 and Tyr-759 was used as bait, Shc binding decreased to control levels (Fig. 2 B). This interference with Shc binding is most likely due to the presence of the negative charge in the threonine position. A tyrosyl-phosphorylated peptide containing an aspartic acid in place of Thr-753 binds neither isoform of Shc (Fig. 2 B). Thus, the binding of signaling molecules via the PTB recognition motif in β3 can be regulated by the phosphorylation of one conserved threonine (753 in β3). Having established that threonine phosphorylation limits the recruitment of PTB-containing proteins, we attempted to identify protein kinases that might be responsible for Thr-753 phosphorylationin vivo. Since incubation with calyculin A led to increased phosphorylation of β3, we asked whether this treatment was accompanied by the activation of a potential β3kinase. Assays of PKA, PKC, casein kinase 2, and Ca2+-dependent kinases showed that none of these enzymes were activated following calyculin A treatment (22Lerea K.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6819-6824Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 23Lerea K.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6553-6561Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 24Hoyt C.H. Oh C.J. Beekman J.B. Litchfield D.W. Lerea K.M. Blood. 1994; 83: 3517-3523Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), nor could activation of MAP kinase be detected (n = 7, data not shown). The phenylalanine located adjacent to Thr-753 is suggestive of a potential site of phosphorylation for PDK1 or, albeit less likely, Akt/PKB (25Alessi D.R. Caudwell F.B. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings B.A. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 26Chan T.O. Rittenhouse S.E. Tsichlis P.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 965-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). Since activation of PDK1 is a prerequisite for activation of Akt/PKB, we tested whether calyculin A stimulated Akt/PKB activity in platelets. Using an antibody that recognizes the active, phosphorylated form of the enzyme, Western blots revealed that concentrations of calyculin A that cause phosphorylation of β3 (20Lerea K.M. Cordero K.P. Sakariassen K.S. Kirk R.I. Fried V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1914-1919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) increase Akt/PKB activity in platelets (data not shown). As seen in Fig. 3, exposure to calyculin A (0.1 μm) increased Akt/PKB activity in platelets by approximately 150% (Fig. 3). The levels of Akt/PKB activation observed were comparable to those induced by agents that promote activation such as collagen (5 μg/ml), thrombin (0.2 units/ml), or PMA (0.25 μm) (Fig. 3B). Generally, Akt/PKB activation in platelets is wortmannin-sensitive (27Banfic H. Tang X.-W. Batty I.H. Downes C.P. Chen C.-S. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), indicating a dependence on PI3-kinase activity. By contrast, Akt/PKB activation by calyculin A was only partially blocked by wortmannin (Fig. 3), implying that calyculin A activates Akt/PKB in both a PI3-kinase-sensitive and -insensitive fashion. We next examined the ability of purified preparations of both Akt/PKB and PDK1 to phosphorylate the carboxyl-terminal segment of β3. Their ability to phosphorylate the unphosphorylated peptide was compared with their ability to phosphorylate (i) a peptide in which Thr-753 was replaced with a phosphothreonine (rendering this residue not phosphorylatable in the assays), or (ii) a peptide in which all threonine and serine residues, except Thr-753, were replaced by alanine residues. Both Akt/PKB and PDK1 phosphorylated those peptides that contained a phosphorylatable Thr-753 residue (Fig.4). The K m value of Akt/PKB for phosphorylating the native β3 peptide was 14.5 mm (n = 2), which is 1000-fold higher than the K m for phosphorylating an Akt-like peptide, which is 18 μm (data not shown). The estimatedK m value of PDK1 for the native β3peptide was 100 ± 17 μm (mean ± S.D.,n = 3). Neither enzyme phosphorylated to a significant degree the peptide that lacked an available Thr-753 (Fig. 4). This behavior indicates that Thr-753 is specifically targeted by both Akt/PKB and PDK1 in vitro. In contrast, two other protein kinases, PKC and cdc2, phosphorylated all three peptides, indicating that they do not preferentially target Thr-753 (Fig. 4). Moreover, the presence of a phosphate group on Thr-753 rendered the peptide a better substrate for cdc2. PKA and casein kinase 2 did not detectably phosphorylate any of the peptides (data not shown). The precise role of threonyl phosphorylation of β3is not yet completely defined. Evidence exists that threonyl phosphorylation of β3 differentially affects αIIbβ3 integrin functions; it promotes inside-out signaling leading to the exposure of fibrinogen/von Willebrand factor binding sites (28van Willigen G. Hers I. Gorter G. Akkerman J.-W.N. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 769-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) but inhibits outside-in integrin signaling linked to cell spreading and cytoskeletal rearrangements (20Lerea K.M. Cordero K.P. Sakariassen K.S. Kirk R.I. Fried V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1914-1919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Integrin engagement leads to the activation of signaling cascades, including the MAP kinase pathway, and redistribution of structural and signaling molecules to cell-matrix contact points (29Miyamoto S. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. Science. 1995; 267: 883-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar,30Chen Q. Kinch M.S. Lin T.H. Burridge K. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26602-26605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies indicate that the mechanism by which integrins initiate signaling events may be a consequence of phosphorylated tyrosine residues in NXXY motifs that are conserved in β1, β3, β6, and β7 subunits (11Law D.A. Nannizzi-Alaimo L. Phillips D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10811-10815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the tyrosine in these domains creates a docking site for proteins that contain PTB domains, including Shc, an adapter protein that may facilitate recruitment of GRB2-guanine nucleotide exchange proteins. This binding sets in motion events that culminate in MAP kinase activation (8Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar) and cytoskeletal rearrangements in the platelet (31Jenkins A.L. Nannizzi-Alaimo L. Silver D. Sellers J.R. Ginsberg M.H. Law D.A. Phillips D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13878-13885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The involvement of threonine residues in regulating the binding potential of these NXXY motifs may provide a mechanism by which outside-in signaling is finely regulated, analogous to the way in which threonyl phosphorylation of cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks) prevents premature activation of newly formed cdk-cyclin complexes (32Desai D. Gu Y. Morgan D.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 571-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). These phosphorylations assure that premature activation of the enzyme does not occur until conditions are optimal for cells to progress through the cell cycle. In the present study, attempts were made to determine how phosphorylation of Thr-753 modulates outside-in signaling using synthetic peptides based on the carboxyl-terminal sequence in β3. Our data argue that phosphorylation of Thr-753, which is conserved in many β subunits, reduces the ability of PTB-containing proteins to bind the NXX(pY) motif in β3. The mechanism by which threonine phosphorylation acts in controlling β3 function is not known. Modeling for secondary structure using Chou-Fasman (33Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 251-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (2337) Google Scholar) algorithms predicts that aspartic acid substitution for Thr-753 (to mimic the negative charge of a phosphate group) results in changes in secondary structure, which may be a mechanism explaining how integrin function is modulated by phosphorylation. A similar change in secondary structure is predicted when a proline substitutes for Ser-752; this mutation has been observedin vivo and inhibits both inside-out and outside-in signaling (16Liu X.-Y. Timmons S. Lin Y.-Z. Hawiger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11819-11824Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 34Tahiliani P.D. Singh L. Auer K.L. LaFlamme S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7892-7898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Although the effects of phosphorylation of Thr-753 serves a regulatory role in signal transduction via β3 integrins, the mechanism platelets use to regulate this phosphorylation is not clear. The inhibitory effects of membrane-permeable inhibitors of serine/threonine phosphatases (e.g. calyculin A) on platelet function have been known for approximately a decade (22Lerea K.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6819-6824Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 35Karaki J. Mitsue M. Nagase H. Ozaki H. Shibata S. Uemura D. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1989; 98: 590-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms by which calyculin A affects platelets are still unclear. Since protein phosphorylation represents a balance between kinase and phosphatase activities, calyculin A may directly shift this balance by inhibiting the phosphatase that removes the phosphate from Thr-753. Alternatively, calyculin A treatment may elevate target protein phosphorylation indirectly by activating the protein kinase that phosphorylates this site on β3. In this study we have presented several lines of evidence to suggest that PDK1 and Akt/PKB are responsible for phosphorylating Thr-753 by asking the following questions. (i) Can we predict by sequence analysis the protein kinase that targets Thr-753? (ii) If so, will calyculin A treatment lead to the apparent activation of this enzyme in platelets? (iii) Do agonists (and subsequent PKC activation) activate the calyculin A-sensitive enzyme? (iv) Is Thr-753 a promiscuous phosphorylation site recognized by several kinases in the platelet? With respect to the first three questions, the results can be summarized as follows. As predicted from its consensus sequence, PDK1 specifically phosphorylates Thr-753 in β3 and calyculin A activates the Akt/PKB pathway in intact platelets in a manner similar to platelet agonists such as thrombin, collagen, and PMA. Although the exact molecular mechanism by which calyculin A activates Akt/PKB remains to be determined, this represents the first demonstration of the activation of an enzyme in platelets upon exposure to calyculin A. These studies are interesting in light of reports that show the rapid activation of PDK1 and Akt/PKB by platelet agonists (27Banfic H. Tang X.-W. Batty I.H. Downes C.P. Chen C.-S. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 36Banfic H. Downes C.P. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11630-11637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, we speculate that treatment of platelets with either calyculin A or agonists leads to the activation of a common kinase, resulting in phosphorylation of Thr-753 in β3, although the residue in β3 that becomes phosphorylated following agonist treatment remains unknown. However, the observation that Thr-753 was specifically targeted by Akt/PKB and PDK1 in peptide substrates is highly suggestive. PKC is also activated in platelets but fails to phosphorylate Thr-753 in the peptide substrate. In β1, it does phosphorylate Ser-756, a residue not conserved in β3 (37Hibbs M.L. Jakes S. Stacker S.A. Wallace R.W. Springer T.A. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 1227-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Parallels may exist between calyculin A effects and antagonists that act via PKA. However, several observations do not support this consideration; PKA does not phosphorylate the β3 peptidein vitro, and calyculin A does not (i) lead to a rise in intracellular cAMP levels (22Lerea K.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6819-6824Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) or (ii) result in phosphorylation of substrates common to PKA (23Lerea K.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6553-6561Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Our results suggest a novel mechanism by which integrin action is controlled; transient phosphorylation of integrin molecules temporally controls outside-in signaling. Being that Thr-753 in β3is conserved in other β subunits, this model may be a common mechanism by which integrin function is regulated. In addition, this model may explain, in part, why there is controversy over whether β3 becomes phosphorylated on threonine residues following the exposure of platelets to agonists (28van Willigen G. Hers I. Gorter G. Akkerman J.-W.N. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 769-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 38Hillery C.A. Smyth S.S. Parise L.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14663-14669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The inconsistency may be attributable to high levels of protein serine/threonine phosphatases in platelets (22Lerea K.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6819-6824Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and that integrins are phosphorylated when their effective concentrations increase upon clustering. In support of these possibilities, stable phosphorylated forms of β3 can be isolated in the presence of protein seryl/threonyl phosphatase inhibitors, okadaic acid and calyculin A (20Lerea K.M. Cordero K.P. Sakariassen K.S. Kirk R.I. Fried V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1914-1919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and theK m for phosphorylation of a β3 peptide by Akt/PKB was in the millimolar range. In conclusion, this report links phosphatase inhibition to kinase activation in platelets. In particular, PDK1 and Akt/PKB activation may be targeting β3 and this may have considerable impact on the regulation of integrin function in platelets. We thank Drs.

Buettner R. Chiao P.J. Yim S.O. Sarkiss M. Tainsky M.A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1258-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Nontumorigenic PA-1 cells constitutively overexpressing GAL4-hAP-2α induced tumors in nude mice similar to the tumorigenic ras PA-1 cells and hAP-2α-overexpressing PA-1 cells (31Kannan P. Tainsky M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 899-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These observations suggested that the AD of hAP-2α mediated tumorigenicity. Our studies indicate that the coactivator PC4, which interacts with the AD of hAP-2α suppresses tumorigenicity in ras-transformed cells (31Kannan P. Tainsky M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 899-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Therefore, a detailed analysis of AD of hAP-2α is crucial to understanding its role in tumorigenicity and to identifying additional factors that interact with this region and participate in transformation. Several forms of AP-2 have been isolated from various species, and they constitute a family of transcription factors. AP-2α has been isolated from human (hAP-2α) (32Mitchell P.J. Timmons P.M.

Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1701-1707PubMed Google Scholar), murine (mAP-2β) (38Moser M. Imhof A. Pscherer A. Bauer R. Amselgruber W. Sinowatz F. Hofstadter F. Schule R. Buettner R.

AP-2γ was isolated from human (hAP-2γ) (3McPherson L.A. Baichwal V.R. Weigel R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4342-4347Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 11Bosher J.M.

Mech Dev. 1996; 54: 83-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). All forms of AP-2 show striking amino acid sequence conservation at their C termini in the region of the DBD and, as expected, they bind to same-target sequences. A comparison of the DNA-binding sites of hAP-2α and hAP-2γ was made recently, and their consensus-binding site was determined to be (G/C)CCNN(A/C/G)(G/A)G(G/C/T) (41McPherson L.A. Weigel R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4040-4049Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The conservation of amino acid sequences occurs relatively less in the N termini, but despite the resulting sequence variation, all forms of AP-2 possess an AD at their N termini. This observation presents a unique opportunity to understand the nature and constitution of the activation motif of AP-2 by comparing the functional role of conserved amino acid sequences. In this report, we have characterized the activation motif of hAP-2α by precisely identifying the amino acids required for its function. The corresponding sequences of other isotypes from various species were also examined to gain insight into the activation property of the AP-2 family of transcription factors. NIH 3T3 and COS-1 cells were grown in modified Eagle's medium with Earl's salts (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hazelton Biologics, Lenexa, KS) and antibiotics at 37 °C in 5% CO2, 95% air. 9117 cells, a subline of PA-1 human teratocarcinoma (42Zeuthen J. Norgaard J.O. Avner P. Fellous M. Wartiovaara J. Vaheri A. Rosen A. Giovanella B.C. Int. J. Cancer. 1980; 25: 19-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), were grown in similar conditions but supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. Transient transfections were performed using SuperFect reagent (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) in NIH 3T3 and COS-1 cells and calcium phosphate precipitate (43Graham F.L. Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6498) Google Scholar) in PA-1 cells grown on 100-mm dishes to introduce DNA. The amount of DNA used in all transfections was equalized by the addition of pBluescript DNA. 1 μg of β-galactosidase expression vector pCH110 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was included in each transfection, and the efficiency of transfection was normalized after assaying the β-galactosidase enzyme (44Miller J.H. Schmeissner U. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 131: 223-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). AP-2 reporter constructs 3× AP-2hMt-CAT and 3× AP-2SV40-CAT contain three 32-base pair synthetic oligonucleotides corresponding to the AP-2 response element harboring sequence of the distal basal-level element of human metallothionein gene IIa or SV40 enhancer region and a HSVtk promoter in the vector pBLCAT2 (45Luckow B. Schutz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 549Google Scholar). Reporter construct G5E1bCAT, a generous gift of Dr. Ptashne (46Sadowski I. Ma J. Triezenberg S. Ptashne M. Nature. 1988; 335: 563-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar) was used to measure the transactivation activity of GAL4-AP-2 fusion constructs. CAT activity in normalized protein was measured by converting [14C]chloramphenicol to mono- and di-acetyl chloramphenicol, essentially as described earlier (47Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5292) Google Scholar). After partitioning the acetylated forms of chloramphenicol on thin layer chromatography plates, the percentage of conversion was calculated by measuring radioactivity on a Storm analyzer (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). The GAL4 DBD and hAP-2α AD containing fusion construct pGAL4-hAP-2α/11–226 was made by inserting amino acids 11–226 of hAP-2α into EcoRI-cut and mung bean nuclease-blunted pSG424 (46Sadowski I. Ma J. Triezenberg S. Ptashne M. Nature. 1988; 335: 563-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar). pGAL4-hAP-2α/11–165 and pGAL4-hAP-2α/11–121 were derived from this construct by deleting the sequence after SmaI and BamHI, respectively. To make further sequential deletions, plasmid pGAL4-hAP-2α/11–226 was linearized at the BamHI site, which cuts after amino acid 121, and Bal31 nuclease was used to remove nucleotides for 1–5 min. After exonuclease digestion, the nonessential C-terminal amino acids 122–226 were removed using SacI, which cuts before the three stop codons. One stop codon exists in each reading frame to ensure termination of protein translation in all reading frames. The plasmids were subjected to dideoxy sequencing to verify sequential deletions. To make precise deletions in the activation motif polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification method was used with a forward oligo containing a BamHI site (5′-GCTACGGATCCXn-3′) and a reverse oligo containing a KpnI site (5′-ACGTTGGTACCXn-3′).Xn refers to 15–20 nucleotides from AP-2 isotypes at the desired end points. After PCR amplification, the fragments were digested with BamHI and KpnI and cloned adjacent to the GAL4 DBD in the vector pSG424. Forward oligo containing aSalI site (5′-ACGTGCACXn-3′) was employed to amplify the hAP-2γ and dAP-2α to avoid complications of an internal BamHI site in the desired regions in these isotypes. The reading frame was maintained for each clone to ensure the fusion of GAL4 DBD and AP-2. The mutant clones GAL4-cAP-2β 53–114 N85D and GAL4-cAP-2β 53–114 Q89R were inadvertently obtained during the preparation of GAL4-cAP-2β 53–114, because of the inherent property of PCR amplification. Other site-directed alterations were made in full-length AP-2 molecules using two complementary oligos with the desired change and the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene Cloning Systems, La Jolla, CA). All constructs were subjected to double-stranded DNA sequencing to verify the clone and/or to ensure the proper reading frame. 5 μg of GAL4-AP-2 fusion protein expression plasmid DNA was transfected into COS-1 cells using SuperFect reagent (Qiagen). After 48 h the cells were harvested and suspended in lysis buffer (1.5% Triton X-100, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, aprotinin 90 μg/ml, leupeptin 50 μg/ml, and benzamidine HCl 20 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2). The cells were lysed by three cycles of freezing and thawing, rocked for 30 min at 4 °C, and spun for 30 min at 14,000 rpm. The supernatant containing the crude protein extract (50 μg) was separated on a 14% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (NEN Life Science Products). The membrane was probed with anti-GAL4-DBD polyclonal antibody made from rabbit (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). The signals were detected using anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase and ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Isotypes of AP-2 transcription factor AP-2α, AP-2β, and/or AP-2γ have been identified from human, murine, chicken, Drosophila, and Xenopus systems (3McPherson L.A. Baichwal V.R. Weigel R.J. Proc.

Mech Dev. 1996; 54: 83-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). All forms of AP-2 show strong amino acid sequence conservation near their C termini beginning with the glutamine amino acid. The position of the glutamine residue in hAP-2α is 209. As shown in Fig. 1, the amino acid sequence of hAP-2β is 93% and that of hAP-2γ is 84%, both of which are similar to hAP-2α. Their DBDs are situated in this region, and, as expected, they bind to same target sequences. The sequence is relatively less conserved at their N termini where they contain their ADs. The hAP-2β and hAP-2γ isotypes are 66 and 63% similar to hAP-2α, respectively, in this region. Interestingly, isotype-specific sequence conservation is retained across many species, especially in human, mouse, and chicken. Mouse and chicken AP-2α and AP-2β isotypes are very similar to their human counterparts, mAP-2γ is very similar to hAP-2γ, and xAP-2 is very similar to hAP-2α. dAP-2α, however, is significantly less conserved. All are better conserved in the region of their DBDs than their N termini. Irrespective of sequence variation at their N termini, all are able to activate transcription. We used this property to examine the sequences responsible for transcription activation. We cloned AP-2 isotypes that showed variation in sequence at their N termini in a mammalian expression vector pSG5 under the control of an SV40 promoter to have an identical backbone. An AP-2 reporter construct 3× AP-2hMt-CAT, containing three AP-2-binding sites derived from the human metallothionein gene IIa promoter, was used to measure AP-2 activity in NIH 3T3 cells. Expression plasmids of AP-2 were cotransfected with the reporter construct, and AP-2 activity was determined. As shown in Fig. 2, hAP-2α activated transcription 2-fold above the endogenous level when 1 μg of its expression plasmid DNA was transfected. The dAP-2α was the strongest activator with about 10-fold induction. In these experiments, xAP-2α activated transcription about 7-fold, cAP-2α 2-fold, mAP-2β 3-fold, cAP-2β 4-fold, hAP-2γ 4-fold, and mAP-2γ 6-fold. We examined their activities using a different AP-2 reporter construct, 3× AP-2SV40-CAT, with AP-2-binding sites derived from an SV40 promoter and found that the pattern of their activation was similar (data not shown). We tested their activity in the human teratocarcinoma cell line PA-1 using 3× AP-2SV40-CAT and observed similar activation of transcription by AP-2 isotypes (Fig. 2). mAP-2β and cAP-2β activation was nearly 2-fold stronger than that observed with 3× AP-2hMT-CAT in NIH 3T3 cells. These results indicate that all AP-2 are capable of activating transcription, albeit with different levels of efficiency. Our next strategy was to narrow the ADs of AP-2 isotypes to the minimal sequences necessary and study their amino acid conservation. First, we selected the hAP-2α, because some preliminary characterization has been done on the AD of this protein (25Kannan P. Buettner R. Chiao P.J. Yim S.O. Sarkiss M. Tainsky M.A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1258-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 48Williams T. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 670-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar) and performed a fine structure analysis to precisely identify the minimal amino acid sequence necessary to activate transcription. Later, we used this information to identify sequences in other AP-2 isotypes to verify their activation and to study how the activation function was conserved. The N terminus of hAP-2α that harbors its activation domain was sequentially deleted and fused to the heterologous GAL4 DBD. As shown in Fig.3 A, the N-terminal 11–226 amino acids are able to activate transcription from the GAL4 reporter construct G5E1bCAT. This region of AP-2 contains the entire AD and the N-terminal region of DBD as previously characterized (48Williams T. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 670-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). The transactivation activity stimulated by this region is arbitrarily set to 100%. Transcription activation by amino acids 11–165 was reduced by about one fourth. Interestingly, the removal of 44 additional amino acids from the C terminus, as in 11–121, restored full transcription. This observation suggests that the region between amino acids 122 and 165 has a negative effect on hAP-2α activation. Amino acids between 11 and 118 and between 11 and 117 activated transcription similar to amino acids 11–121, indicating that the central activation motif is between amino acids 11 and 117. A slight reduction in transcription was seen with the construct 11–107. Removal of two additional amino acids, as in 11–105, reduced transcription dramatically, indicating that glycine at position 106, leucine at position 107, or both are essential for AP-2 transcription activation. The constructs containing amino acids between 11 and 105, 11 and 103, 11 and 102, and 11 and 93 retained nearly 10% of the ability to activate transcription when compared with GAL4-hAP-2α/11–226. Further removal of amino acids, as in 11–76 or 11–30, near completely abolished transcription activation. The transcriptional activation of these GAL4-hAP-2α fusion constructs was similar in COS-1 cells (not shown). The expression of these fusion constructs is comparable in these cells, and some of them are shown in Fig. 3 B. An earlier study (48Williams T. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 670-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar) and our preliminary observation indicate that removal of the N-terminal 50 amino acids does not affect the activation function of hAP-2α. To precisely find the N-terminal boundary of the sequence that activates transcription, we prepared DNA fragments that varied by one to a few amino acids. These fragments were linked to the GAL4 DBD, and their activation properties were determined. The amino acids between 51 and 117 and between 52 and 117 showed near full efficiency of activation indicating that the central core of the activation motif resides in this region. The activity of the construct containing the amino acids between 53 and 117 was reduced more than 6-fold, indicating that the aspartic acid at position 52 is the first critical residue at the N-terminus of hAP-2α. Likewise, the construct containing amino acids between 55 and 117 also did not significantly activate transcription. We progressively narrowed the distal portion of the hAP-2α AD to more precisely identify the last critical residue of activation. As shown above in the sequential deletion experiments, the constructs containing the amino acids 11–107 and 11–117 had 82 and 109% activity, respectively, but amino acids 11–105 were unable to activate transcription. Constructs containing the amino acids 52–117, 52–114, 52–110, and 52–108 activated transcription significantly. The 107% transcription activity stimulated by the construct containing amino acids between 52 and 108 indicates that the central minimal motif of hAP-2α resides within this sequence. A construct containing the amino acids 51–106 lost activation properties dramatically, indicating that leucine at 107 is critical for activation. The residues at positions 107 and 108 are both leucines. The amino acids 51–77 fused to GAL4-DBD do not activate transcription. However, constructs containing the amino acids 6–77 and 20–77 activated about one-eighth activity. The weak activation by the amino acids 6–77 and 20–77 when compared with the relatively no activation by the amino acids 51–77 suggest that the region between amino acids 20 and 50 have a weak intrinsic activation property. This region also positively elevates the activity of hAP-2α when the constructs 20–110 and 51–110 are compared. As summarized in Fig.4 A, the amino acid sequence between the critical aspartic acid at position 52 and the leucines at positions 107 and 108 harbors the central activation motif of hAP-2α, which can significantly activate transcription. There are two regions, one between amino acids 20 and 51 and another between 165 and 226, that positively affect hAP-2α activity. The region between amino acids 122 and 165 has a negative effect. To gain a detailed understanding of the structure and function of the activation motifs of all AP-2 family transcription factors, we identified the region corresponding to the amino acids between 52 and 108 of hAP-2α in other AP-2 isotypes of various species. We PCR amplified the identified regions, linked them to GAL4 DBD, and tested their ability to activate transcription from a GAL4 target sequence. In such experiments, the amino acid sequences will demonstrate their capability of transcriptional activation, and their sequence variation will serve as a natural source of mutations that can be used for analysis. If two forms of AP-2 have 100% identity in this region, such as hAP-2α and mAP-2α or hAP-2β and mAP-2β, only one of them was selected for examination. A comparison of the amino acid sequences of selected AP-2 isotypes and the efficiency of transcription activation by select regions are shown in Fig.4 B. The selected sequences of AP-2 isotypes except dAP-2α are capable of activating transcription albeit with varied efficiency in both NIH 3T3 and PA-1 cells. Their expression is comparable in COS-1 cells (Fig. 4 C). The efficiency of their transcription activation, although not identical, is comparable with the relative activities of corresponding full-length AP-2 isotypes from AP-2 target sequences (Fig. 1). These results demonstrate"

Macrophages are key components in both innate and adaptive immunity. They are widely distributed throughout many organs where they form a lattice beneath epithelial surfaces to protect the ports of entry of infectious agents. This goal is achieved by a variety of cell surface receptors, which are able to recognize antigenic arrays or patterns that are generic to microorganisms (1Janeway Jr., C.A. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 11-16Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar). The best characterized pattern recognition receptor is the mannose receptor (MR),1 which recognizes patterns of carbohydrates that decorate the surfaces and cell walls of many pathogens. Preferred ligands are glycoproteins with terminal mannose and fucose, whereasN-acetylglucosamine and glucose bind with lower affinity (2Largent B.L. Walton K.M. Hoppe C.A. Lee Y.C. Schnaar R.L. J.

The mature MR is composed of a single subunit, which has an apparent molecular mass of 180 kDa and bears N- andO-linked sugars (5Taylor M.E. Conary J.T. Lennartz M.R. Stahl P.D. Drickamer K. J. Biol.

Cloning of the MR further revealed that it is a type I transmembrane protein, which consists of five different domains: an N-terminal cysteine-rich region, a fibronectin type II domain, a series of eight C-type lectin-like carbohydrate recognition domains, a single transmembrane domain, and a 45-amino acid cytoplasmic tail (5Taylor M.E.

The MR thus represents the prototype of a new family of multilectin receptor proteins (13Stahl P.D. Ezekowitz R.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 50-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar) that are widely distributed in virtually all organs in various cell types. Recent work has pointed to the presence of a signal transduction pathway associated with ligand binding to the MR. Especially studies with pathogens bearing surface-bound mannose as well as mannosylated particles demonstrate that secretion of mediators and cytokines is activated via the MR (14Garner R.E. Rubanowice K. Sawyer R.T. Hudson J.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1994; 55: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 15Shibata Y. Metzger W.J. Myrvik Q.N. J.

These new data raise fundamental questions about the biological role of the MR. In particular, the intracellular trafficking of the MR becomes an important issue for the regulation of its biological activity. Previous studies of the trafficking of the MR have demonstrated that the receptor mediates both rapid endocytosis and phagocytosis at the cell surface. MR-mediated phagocytosis has been found in macrophages (17Tietze C. Schlesinger P. Stahl P. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 92: 417-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 18Kruskal B.A. Sastry K.

Med. 1992; 176: 1673-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) but the exact trafficking of the MR during phagocytosis is not well understood. In contrast, more is known about the endocytic route of the MR. Initially, ligands bind to the MRs at neutral pH at the plasma membrane. The receptor-ligand complexes subsequently enter acidified endosomal compartments where the lower pH causes dissociation of the ligands. To mediate repeated rounds of internalization, the MRs recycle constitutively from the endosomal system back to the plasma membrane (4Stahl P. Schlesinger P.H. Sigardson E. Rodman J.S. Lee Y.C. Cell. 1980; 19: 207-215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 17Tietze C. Schlesinger P. Stahl P. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 92: 417-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Importantly they avoid being transported to lysosomes where they would be degraded (7Lennartz M.R. Cole F.S. Stahl P.D. J. Biol.

Hoefsmit E.C.M. Lanzavecchia A. Pieters J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 2417-2425Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Both the cytosolic tail and the transmembrane domain are required for the endocytic function of the MR as demonstrated by analyzing chimeric constructs between the Fc receptor and the MR (18Kruskal B.A. Sastry K. Warner A.B. Mathieu C.E. Ezekowitz R.A. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1673-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In contrast, MRs lacking the cysteine-rich domain and the fibronectin type II domain showed no loss of endocytic capacity when expressed in fibroblasts (22Taylor M.E. Bezouska K. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1719-1726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present paper we have elucidated the intracellular trafficking of the MR in more detail. To fulfill its biological role, it is essential for the MR to be correctly sorted in endosomes to remain in the endosome/plasma membrane recycling pathway and avoid transport to lysosomes with subsequent degradation. The trafficking of other recycling receptors is known to be regulated by sorting signals that are recognized at different stages of the pathway. In particular, the endosomal sorting step has recently been shown for the cation-dependent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CD-MPR) to be directed by a di-aromatic amino acid motif (Phe18-Trp19) in its cytoplasmic tail (23Schweizer A. Kornfeld S. Rohrer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14471-14476Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The CD-MPR is a type I integral membrane protein that functions to transport newly synthesized acid hydrolases from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to endosomes thereby recycling between the TGN, endosomes, and the plasma membrane (24Kornfeld S. Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 483-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1235) Google Scholar, 25Hille-Rehfeld A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 177-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 26Ludwig T. LeBorgne R. Hoflack B. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 202-206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). By analyzing the intracellular distribution of a variety of chimeric constructs between the MR and the CD-MPR we demonstrate that, analogous to the CD-MPR, a pair of aromatic residues (Tyr18-Phe19) in the cytosolic tail of the MR mediates sorting in endosomes. This finding is consistent with the di-aromatic motif being a general determinant for this sorting step. Enzymes used in molecular cloning were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Biofinex (Praroman, Switzerland), or Life Technologies, Inc.; fetal calf serum and Lipofectin were from Life Technologies, Inc.; Percoll was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; nitrocellulose from Schleicher & Schuell; protease inhibitors were from Sigma; ECL Western blotting reagents were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech or NEN Life Science Products. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by the DNA synthesis facility of the Friedrich Miescher Institut. All basic DNA procedures were as described (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1998Google Scholar). To create the MPR-MR chimeric constructs, BglII andMluI sites were engineered to flank the transmembrane domain and cytosolic tail of the MR by PCR. A human placenta QUICK-Clone cDNA (CLONTECH Laboratories Inc.) was used as a template together with the oligonucleotides AAAGAGATCTCCCACGTGGCCGGAGTAG (Bgl-MR.d) and GAAACGCGTTGAGGTACTAGATGACCG (Mlu-MR.up) as downstream and upstream primers. In addition, the endogenous BglII site in the cytosolic tail was destroyed by a silent point mutation in amino acid Asp32. The PCR product was digested with BglII and MluI, and the purified fragment was assembled with theEcoRI-BglII fragment of pBSK (B−H−)-MPR(BglII−) (28Rohrer J. Schweizer A. Johnson K.F. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1297-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and the EcoRI-MluI fragment of pSFFVneo in a three part ligation. The resulting plasmid was designated pSFFVneo-MPR-MRMR wt. The PCR procedure of Ho et al. (29Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene ( Amst. ). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6833) Google Scholar) was used to generate the construct MPR-MRMR YF-AA, MPR-MRMR Y18A, and MPR-MRMR F19A with MPR-MRMR wt serving as template and oligonucleotides Bgl-MR.d and Mlu-MR.up as the downstream and upstream primers. Appropriate partial complementary pairs of oligonucleotides in which the desired amino acid replacements had been incorporated were chosen as internal primers. The final PCR product was subcloned into pSFFVneo as described above. The constructs MPR-MRMR YQTL, MPR-MRMR YSAF, MPR-MRMR YF-AA/YQTL, and MPR-MMRMR YF-AA/YSAF were created by PCR using either pSFFVneo MPR-MRMR wt or pSFFVneo MPR-MRMR YF-AA as a template. For these reactions Bgl-MR.d was used as a downstream primer together with an upstream primer containing either the YQTL or YSAF sequence attached to the extreme C-terminal sequence of the MR. The PCR products were digested with BglII and MluI and ligated into pSFFVneo as described above. All of the coding sequence created by PCR was verified by sequencing. A cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor-II receptor-deficient mouse L cell line designated D9 (LRec−) was maintained in α-modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a 5% humidified CO2 atmosphere (30Gabel C.A. Goldberg D.E. Kornfeld S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 775-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The cells were transfected with 4 μg of XbaI-linearized DNA using Lipofectin according to the manufacturer's directions. Selection was performed with neomycin (G418), and resistant colonies were screened for expression by immunoblotting. Selected clones were expanded for further study and maintained in selective medium. Monoclonal antibody 22D4 was generously provided by Dr. D. Messner (31Messner D.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 306: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This monoclonal antibody is specific for the bovine CD-MPR and does not cross-react with the mouse CD-MPR. Confluent cells grown in a 100-mm Petri dish were incubated for 24 h in growth medium supplemented with 100 μm each of pepstatin A and leupeptin. The cells were then harvested, ruptured with a ball-bearing homogenizer, and fractionated on 17.5% Percoll density gradients as described previously (28Rohrer J. Schweizer A. Johnson K.F. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1297-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In brief, a cushion followed by nine fractions were collected from the bottom of the tube and then combined as follows: fractions 1–3 (pool I, containing 70–80% of lysosomal enzyme activity), fractions 4–6 (pool II, containing intermediate density membranes), and fractions 7–9 (pool III, containing low density membranes including endosomes, the Golgi complex, plasma membrane, and the endoplasmic reticulum). The Percoll was removed by three centrifugation steps and the pelleted membranes were solubilized in 0.5% Triton X-100. An aliquot corresponding to 1:10 of the total volume was removed for the β-hexosaminidase assay, and the remaining sample was boiled in nonreducing SDS sample buffer. Aliquots corresponding to 1:15 of the final sample volume were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Proteins were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide minigels (Bio-Rad) by using the Laemmli system (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis gels were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes according to the method of Towbin et al. (33Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44923) Google Scholar). The immunoblotting was performed as described previously (28Rohrer J. Schweizer A. Johnson K.F. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1297-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Autoradiographs were quantitated using a personal densitometer (Molecular Dynamics Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). The steady state surface distribution of wt and mutant MR constructs was measured by binding of iodinated antibodies and by biotinylation with equal results. The first method was as described in Schweizer et al. (23Schweizer A. Kornfeld S. Rohrer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14471-14476Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) except that that the anti-CD-MPR antibodies were iodinated by ANAWA Trading SA (Zürich, Switzerland) according to their standard protocol. For the biotinylation, confluent cells in 12-well plates were incubated for 24 h with 100 μm each of pepstatin A and leupeptin. The cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS supplemented with 0.25 mm MgSO4 and 0.7 mmCaCl2 (PBS++) before incubation with either PBS++ (surface) or PBS++ containing 0.05% saponin (total). The cells were then incubated for 15 min on ice with either PBS++ containing 3 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (surface) or with PBS++ containing 3 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin and 0.05% saponin (total). Subsequently the cells were first washed once with PBS++ containing 50 mm glycine (surface) or PBS++ containing 50 mm glycine/0.05% saponin (total) and then twice with either PBS++ (surface) or PBS++ supplemented with 0.05% saponin (total). Finally, the cells were solubilized in 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 8, containing 1% Triton X-100, transferred to a 1.5-ml tube, and centrifuged for 20 min at 70,000 rpm in a TLA100.3 rotor (Beckman Instruments). Immunoprecipitation and Western blots of the chimeras was performed as described (28Rohrer J. Schweizer A. Johnson K.F. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1297-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The biotinylated fraction of the proteins was then detected by enhanced chemiluminescence using streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase. Cells grown in 6-well plates were rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS++ and then incubated with 1.5 ml of 1 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin in PBS++ for 15 min to biotinylate surface proteins. Biotinylation was stopped by washing once with 50 mm glycine in PBS++ and twice with PBS++. Some of the cells were then incubated at 37 °C with prewarmed growth medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, for different periods of time (1, 2, and 3 min). The cells were returned to 4 °C to stop internalization and then incubated on ice twice for 20 min in a freshly prepared glutathione solution (50 mm glutathione, 75 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8) to remove the biotin from proteins that were present on the cell surface. In addition, two samples that were not incubated at 37 °C were treated either with (0% control) or without (100% control) the glutathione solution. After reduction, the excess glutathione was quenched with a 5-min incubation in PBS++ containing 5 mg/ml iodoacetamide. The cells were then washed once with PBS++, lysed in 1 ml of 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8, containing 1% Triton X-100, and homogenized with a 25-gauge needle connected to a 1-ml syringe. The resulting homogenates were centrifuged for 20 min at 70,000 rpm in a TLA100.3 rotor, and the supernatant was subjected to immunoprecipitation and Western blotting as described (28Rohrer J. Schweizer A. Johnson K.F. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1297-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The biotinylated fraction of the proteins was then detected by enhanced chemiluminescence using streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase. β-Hexosaminidase activity was determined as described (28Rohrer J. Schweizer A. Johnson K.F. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1297-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay kit by using protein standard I. In a previous study, it was demonstrated that proper sorting of the CD-MPR in endosomes depends on a pair of aromatic amino acids (Phe-Trp) at positions 18 and 19 from the transmembrane domain (23Schweizer A. Kornfeld S. Rohrer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14471-14476Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The residues Phe18-Trp19 are required to keep CD-MPRs from being delivered to lysosomes where they would be degraded. Because the replacement of the Phe18-Trp19 sequence with other aromatic residues did not alter the intracellular distribution of the receptor, it appears that the important feature for endosomal sorting of the CD-MPR is the presence of two aromatic residues in its cytoplasmic tail. In our studies to define features of the human MR required for its sorting in endosomal compartments, we initially compared the amino acid sequences of the cytoplasmic tails of the human and mouse MRs and the CD-MPR, for which the cytosolic tail is identical in all known species (Fig. 1). The evaluation revealed that both MRs contain a di-aromatic amino acid sequence (YF) in their cytosolic tail. As in the CD-MPR, the YF motif of the human MR is located at positions 18 and 19 from the transmembrane domain, whereas this distance is increased by only one amino acid in the mouse MR. In addition, both MRs share a phenylalanine five residues upstream from the di-aromatic sequence with the CD-MPR. This Phe13 in the CD-MPR is part of a signal (13FXXXXF18; with F18being the key residue) for rapid internalization from the plasma membrane (34Johnson K.F. Chan W. Kornfeld S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 10010-10014Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). A similar signal (FXNPXY) is also required for the internalization of the low density lipoprotein receptor (35Chen W.J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3116-3123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, Tyr18 and Phe19 are likely candidates to direct sorting of the MR in endosomes. In analogy to the CD-MPR and the low density lipoprotein receptor, Tyr18could also be essential for internalization from the plasma membrane. To test if the di-aromatic amino acid sequence Tyr18-Phe19 indeed functions to avoid delivery of the MR to dense lysosomes, we created a variety of chimeric constructs that contain the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains of the MR linked to the lumenal domain of the CD-MPR (Fig.2). The cytosolic tail and transmembrane anchor have previously been shown to be sufficient for correct intracellular trafficking of the MR (18Kruskal B.A. Sastry K. Warner A.B. Mathieu C.E. Ezekowitz R.A. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1673-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The CD-MPR lumenal domain, on the other hand, while being an ideal reporter molecule to study lysosomal avoidance/delivery, does not contain endosomal sorting information (28Rohrer J. Schweizer A. Johnson K.F. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1297-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 36Peters C. Braun M. Weber B. Wendland M. Schmidt B. Pohlmann R. Waheed A. von F.-K. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3497-3506Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The first chimeric construct includes a wt MR cytosolic tail sequence (MPR-MRMR wt, Fig. 2), whereas the second chimera has Tyr18and Phe19 in the cytoplasmic domain changed to alanines (MPR-MRMR YF-AA, Fig. 2). Because, as discussed above, Tyr18 might be part of a potential signal for rapid endocytosis, we considered the possibility that mutation of Tyr18-Phe19 also affects internalization of the MR. This would prevent a correct assessment of the intracellular sorting step in endosomes. Two additional constructs were therefore prepared in which the tetrapeptide sequences YQTL and YSAF were attached to the C terminus of MPR-MRMR YF-AA (MPR-MRMR YF-AA/YQTL and MPR-MRMR YF-AA/YSAF, Fig. 2). Both motifs are classical signals for rapid internalization from the plasma membrane with the essential features of a tyrosine in the first position and a bulky hydrophobic residue in the last position. The first signal, YQTL, combines attributes of the internalization motifs of Lamp1 (YQTI) (37Höning S. Hunziker W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 321-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 38Guarnieri F.G. Arterburn L.M. Penno M.B. Cha Y. August J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268 (1646): 1941Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and TGN38 (YQRL) (39Bos K. Wraight C. Stanley K.K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2219-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 40Humphrey J.S. Peters P.J. Yuan L.C. Bonifacino J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1123-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), whereas the second signal, YSAF, corresponds to the internalization motif of the mouse polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (41Piskurich J.F. Blanchard M.H. Youngman K.R. France J.A. Kaetzel C.S. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 1735-1747PubMed Google Scholar). The signals YQTL and YSAF were chosen to facilitate internalization from the plasma membrane without affecting intracellular sorting. As a control, these sequences were also attached to the wt construct (MPR-MRMR YQTL and MPR-MRMR YSAF, Fig. 2). The six constructs were stably transfected into mouse L cells and several clones of each mutant were selected for subsequent experiments. The intracellular distribution of the expressed proteins was then analyzed by isoosmotic Percoll density gradients, which separate dense lysosomes from other organelles (28Rohrer J. Schweizer A. Johnson K.F. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1297-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 42Green S.A. Zimmer K.P. Griffiths G. Mellman I. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1227-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). To this end, cell lines were first preincubated for 24 h in medium supplemented with pepstatin A and leupeptin to inhibit degradation of receptors that had entered lysosomes. The cells were then harvested, homogenized with a ball-bearing homogenizer, and subjected to 17.5% Percoll density gradient fractionation. The fractions from the gradients were analyzed in three pools: pool I (bottom of the gradient) contains the bulk of the dense lysosomes (70–80% of β-hexosaminidase activity), whereas low density membranes including endosomes, the Golgi complex, plasma membrane, and the endoplasmic reticulum are recovered in pool III (top of gradient) (28Rohrer J. Schweizer A. Johnson K.F. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1297-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 42Green S.A. Zimmer K.P. Griffiths G. Mellman I. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1227-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Intermediate density membranes are found in pool II. The distribution of the various constructs was determined by electrophoresis of the Percoll density fractions followed by Western blotting with anti-CD MPR monoclonal antibodies. As shown in Fig. 3, 20 ± 3% of the wild type chimeric receptor MPR-MRMR wt accumulated in dense lysosomes. A similar accumulation in lysosomes was found when Tyr18 and Phe19 were replaced with alanines (MPR-MRMR YF-AA, 18 ± 9%). However, the same mutant receptor was found to be highly missorted to lysosomes when the internalization signals YQTL or YSAF were attached to its C terminus. 46 ± 5% of MPR-MRMR YF-AA/YQTL and 47 ± 8% of MPR-MRMR YF-AA/YSAF were recovered in dense lysosomes (pool I). In contrast, the addition of the internalization motifs to the wild type MPR-MRMR did not significantly influence lysosomal accumulation (MPR-MRMR YQTL, 26 ± 8% and MPR-MRMR YSAF, 19 ± 10%). These results suggest that the Tyr18-Phe19motif in the cytoplasmic tail of the MR plays an essential role in endosomal sorting. The importance of Tyr18-Phe19 to prevent trafficking to lysosomes, however, is only apparent after the attachment of an internalization motif to the mutant receptor. This suggests that, as expected, the YF-AA mutation also impairs internalization at the cell surface. Thus a greater fraction of MPR-MRMR YF-A"

Among these is the ability to transport zinc from the apical to the basal compartment. This process was enhanced following exposure by the apical compartment to increasing concentrations of the metal. High pressure liquid chromatography fractionation of the media obtained from cells labeled with radioactive zinc showed that metallothioneins (MTs), small metal-binding, cysteine-rich proteins), were present in the apical and basal media of controls as well as in cells grown in the presence of high concentrations of zinc. Following exposure to the metal, the levels of Zn-MTs in the apical medium increased, while in the basal compartment the greatest part of zinc appeared in a free form with minor changes in the levels of basal MTs. Metabolic labeling experiments with radioactive cysteine confirmed the apical secretion of MTs. A stable transfectant clone of Caco-2 cells (CL11) was selected for its ability to express constitutively high levels of the mouse metallothionein I protein. This cell line showed an enhanced transport of the metal following exposure to high concentrations of zinc and a constitutive secretion of the mouse metallothionein I protein in the apical compartment. Together, these findings strongly support the hypothesis of a functional role between the biosynthesis and secretion of MTs and the transport of zinc in intestinal cells.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 913-915Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Bremner I. Beattie J.H. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1990; 10: 63-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). MTs are present in many tissues, and their synthesis is transcriptionally regulated by a great number of molecules, such as heavy metals (zinc, copper, cadmium), corticosteroids, interleukins, interferon, serum growth factors, and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate among others. In humans, eight isoforms have been described, although with different tissue specificity (3Hamer D.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 913-915Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Bremner I. Beattie J.H.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7250-7259Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Several heavy metals like copper, cadmium, mercury, and zinc are able to bind MTs with different affinity (3Hamer D.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 913-915Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Each MT molecule is able to complex seven atoms of zinc with a binding affinity lower than the other heavy metals (1Vallee B.L. Falchuk K.H. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 79-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Hamer D.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 913-915Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Vallee B.L. Auld D.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5647-5659Crossref PubMed Scopus (1528) Google Scholar). Although the MTs accumulate in the cytosol, small amounts are also present in the serum and in the urine of mammals (9Bremner I. Mehra R.K. Sato M. Kägi J.H.R. Kojima Y. Metallothionein II. Birkhäuser, Basel1987: 52-507Google Scholar). The levels of MT can be regulated by the nutritional status of the animal, for example zinc-depletion (10Sato M. Mehra R.K. Bremner I. J. Nutr. 1988; 114: 1683-1689Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar) or by the exposure to metals in the environment (e.g.cadmium) (11Falck F.Y. Fine L.J. Smith R.G. Garvey J. Schork A. England B. McClatchey K.D. Linton J. Br. J. Ind. Med. 1983; 40: 305-313PubMed Google Scholar). In vertebrates, zinc is absorbed in the gut through the apical surface of enterocytes (12Lönnerdal B. Mills C.F. Zinc in Human Biology. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1988: 33-56Google Scholar, 13Cousins R.J. Physiol. Rev. 1985; 65: 238-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms involved in the transepithelial transport of the metal are at the present time still poorly understood. Zinc is thought to be transported by a carrier-mediated saturable process that may be energy-dependent (13Cousins R.J. Physiol. Rev. 1985; 65: 238-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar). Previous studies with radioactive isotopes have established that the synthesis of MTs is induced within the enterocyte by parenteral or oral administration of zinc (14Menard M.P. McKormick C.C. Cousins R.J. J. Nutr. 1981; 111: 1353-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 15Flanagan P.R. Haist J. Valberg L.S. J.

Nutr. 1992; 122: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), while in rats and humans the secretion of zinc in the gastrointestinal tract is regulated by the dietary status of the metal (17Jackson M.J. Jones D.A. Edwards R.H.T. Br. J. Nutr. 1981; 46: 15-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 18Jackson M.J. Jones D.A. Edwards R.H.T. Swainbank I.G. Coleman M.L. Br. J. Nutr. 1984; 51: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Data in this paper describe the transport of zinc in polarized Caco-2 cells, an in vitro model of enterocyte differentiation (19Pinto M. Robine-Leon S. Appay M.D. Kedinger M. Triadou N. Dussaulx E. Lacroix B. Simon-Assman P. Haffen K. Fogh J. Zweibaun A. Biol. Cell. 1983; 47: 323-330Google Scholar), and provide evidence of its role in the synthesis and secretion of MTs. Furthermore, zinc transport was found to be affected both by its concentration in the medium as well as by the expression of MT proteins, thus suggesting a cooperative relationship in the regulation of zinc transport in enterocyte cells. All culture reagents were supplied by Sigma. Fetal calf serum was from Hyclone (Beiderland, Holland); permeable Transwell filter supports were from Costar Corning (New York, NY). Solid chemicals and liquid reagents were obtained from E. Merck (Darmstadt, Germany), Farmitalia Carlo Erba (Milan, Italy), and Serva Feinbiochemica (Heidelberg, Germany); SDS was purchased from BDH (Poole, United Kingdom). [35S]cysteine (specific activity >1000 Ci/mmol) and 65Zn (activity between 14.01 and 38.81 mCi/mg) were obtained from NEN Life Science Products;14C-labeled protein molecular weight markers were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; the epithelial volt-ohmmeter was from Millipore Corp. (Bedford, MA); Bio-Rad-Sec 125 HPLC columns (300 × 7.8 mm, 5-μm particle size) were from Bio-Rad. The Roche Molecular Biochemicals (LDH) kit (Mannheim, Germany) was used to assay lactic dehydrogenase activities. Caco-2 cells were a kind gift of Dr. E. Roudriguez-Boulan (Cornell University Medical College, New York, NY). Cells were routinely grown on 100-mm Petri dishes at 37 °C in a mixture of 5% CO2, 95% air in Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium high glucose, supplemented with nonessential amino acids, penicillin (60 units/ml), glutamine (2 mm), streptomycin (100 units/ml), and 20% fetal calf serum containing 4.5 ng/ml zinc, as assayed by atomic flame spectroscopy. At passages between 75 and 90, cells were seeded on polycarbonate Transwell permeable filter supports and grown at confluence between 16 and 21 days. The integrity of the monolayer and the formation of tight junctions were proved by the high values of transepithelial electrical resistance (between 700 and 1000 watts/well) and by the impermeability to radioactive inulin, a marker of paracellular transport. The potential toxic effect of zinc on the integrity of cell membranes was determined by spectroscopically measuring the reduced NAD+ produced by the activity of the cytosolic enzyme lactic dehydrogenase present in the media and in the cell lysates. The presence of microvilli on the apical membranes and the formation of tight junctions, as assessed by electron microscopy, confirmed the morphological differentiation of the cells. All experiments were carried out on cells grown on filter supports at full differentiation and cultured for 20 h in TMH medium containing Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium high glucose, deprived of bicarbonate and supplemented with 10 mm TES, 10 mm MOPS, 15 mm HEPES, 2 mmNaH2PO4, pH 7.3 in the absence of serum. Transport and labeling experiments were carried with the same medium without fetal calf serum for a maximum of 20 h. Radioactive 65Zn (14.01–38.81 mCi/mg) was supplemented from the apical chamber (control, 5 μm ZnCl2). In metal-exposed cells, ZnCl2 was added to reach final concentrations of 50, 100, and 200 μm. After the 20-h pulse, apical and basal media were collected; the filters were washed twice with TMH medium, pH 7.3, and cells were lysed at 4 °C for 10 min with buffer containing 1% CHAPS. Cell lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C in Eppendorf microcentrifuge at maximum speed. Incorporation of65Zn was evaluated with a Beckman γ-counter. Differentiated Caco-2 cells grown on filters were labeled for 20 h with 150 μCi/ml [35S]cysteine (specific activity >1000 Ci/mmol) in complete medium containing 20 μm cold cysteine. Cells were then washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 100 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4 (20Cigliano S. Remondelli P. Minichiello L. Mellone M.C. Martire G. Bonatti S. Leone A. Exp. Cell. Res. 1996; 228: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The apical and basal media and the cell lysates were centrifuged for 10 min in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C, and the supernatant was stored at −20 °C. Incorporation of the labeled amino acid was determined by precipitating the proteins with trichloroacetic acid and counting the radioactivity in a Packard scintillation counter. For electrophoretic analysis, the same amounts of radioactive proteins for each sample were acetone-precipitated, resuspended in 20 μl of H2O, reduced, alkylated (21Bonatti S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 512-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), and analyzed on 20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (22Welch W.J. Sefton B.M. J. Virol. 1979; 29: 1186-1195Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After the run, gels were treated with Entensify, dried, and exposed at −80 °C for autoradiography. 65Zn-Labeled cell lysates or media were loaded on a Bio-Rad-Sec 125 HPLC column (300 × 7.8 mm, 5-μm particle size) equilibrated with 50 mmNaH2PO4, 150 mm NaCl buffer containing 10 mm NaN3 (pH 6.8). The column was eluted with the same buffer at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions of 0.33 ml were analyzed for zinc radioactivity. Purified equine metallothionein was used as standard to calculate the elution profile of Caco-2-derived human MTs. The plasmid pLTRMT was constructed by digesting the murine metallothionein I (mMTI) gene (23Durnam D.M. Perrin F. Gannon F. Palmiter R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 6511-6515Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) with the BglII restriction enzyme at the site corresponding to the 5′-untranslated region of the mRNA in the first exon and with the EcoRI restriction enzyme at the site corresponding to the end of the entire 3′-flanking region of the gene. This DNA fragment was inserted in the expression plasmid pFLTR containing the human CD8α cDNA under the control of the promoter and enhancer from the Friend murine leukemia virus, digested with BglI and EcoRI to remove the CD8α cDNA and the second intron and the polyadenylation signal of the β-globin gene (24Migliaccio G. Zurzolo C. Nitsch L. Obici S. Lotti L.V. Torrisi M.R. Pascale M.C. Leone A. Bonatti S. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 52: 291-296PubMed Google Scholar). Caco-2 cells were cotransfected with the calcium phosphate method using the described pLTRMT plasmid and pRSVHygro (25Santerre R.F. Schmidt R.J. Gene ( Amst. ). 1984; 30: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), a plasmid carrying the resistance gene to hygromycin. Positive clones to the hygromycin resistance were screened for the expression of the mMTI gene by Northern blot analyses. CL11 clone was chosen for high levels of mMTI expression. Experiments of zinc transport were performed on Caco-2 cells grown on permeable filters between 16 and 21 days to reach a fully differentiated status. To test the integrity of cells treated with increasing concentrations of ZnCl2 (50–400 μm) for 20 h, we screened the activity of the cytosolic enzyme lactate dehydrogenase both in the apical and basal media. Cells exposed to ZnCl2 showed no major difference compared with control cells (TableI). A decrease was observed in the lactate dehydrogenase activities present in the apical media of cells exposed to high concentrations of the metal; since in these cells we routinely found higher values of the transepithelial electric resistance (data not shown), it results that zinc positively regulates the tightness of the junctions and/or the stability of the membranes. Taken together, these results suggested us that, under the experimental conditions used, metal exposure did not affect cell integrity. Thereafter, all subsequent experiments were carried out with metal concentrations up to 200 μm for a maximum of 20 h.Table ILactic dehydrogenase activity in control and zinc-exposed Caco-2 cellsControl100 μm ZnCl2200 μmZnCl2400 μm ZnCl2Apical medium1.99 ± 0.721.43 ± 0.051.18 ± 0.020.91 ± 0.04Basal medium0.02 ± 0.020.08 ± 0.000.07 ± 0.010.06 ± 0.04Lysates97.9 ± 0.7098.04 ± 0.0798.7 ± 0.0099.04 ± 0.02Values are the mean of six different experiments and are expressed as percentage of the total enzymatic activity detected in the cell lysates and apical and basal media.

Open table in a new tab Values are the mean of six different experiments and are expressed as percentage of the total enzymatic activity detected in the cell lysates and apical and basal media. Metal-induced cells were exposed to zinc for 20 h. 65Zn transport was assayed into Caco-2 cells at increasing concentrations of the metal in the apical chamber. In these conditions, the transport from the apical toward the basal chamber was achieved in both cell types (Fig. 1). It is noteworthy that the transport increased with time from 6 to 20 h reaching a peak when the cells were exposed to higher (50–200 μm) concentrations of ZnCl2. The amount of Zn2+ transported in 20 h was calculated to be 0.140 ± 0.02 nmol of Zn2+/cm2 in the basal chamber in the control cells (mean ± S.E.,n = 8). In the presence of 50, 100, and 200 μm ZnCl2, transport increased to 4.38 ± 1.23, 7.52 ± 1.15, and 13.08 ± 2.50 nmol transported into the basal chamber (mean ± S.E., n = 8), respectively (Fig. 1). We next monitored by HPLC chromatography the distribution of zinc (free or in a chelated form) in the apical and basal media as well as in the cell lysates. The Zn2+ distribution was examined in cells grown in the presence of 5 μm ZnCl2 (control cells) (Fig.2, A–C) or cells exposed for 20 h in the apical compartment either to 50 (Fig. 2,D–F) or 100 μm ZnCl2 (Fig. 2,G–I). These concentrations of Zn2+ in the apical chamber corresponded to a total of 500, 5000, and 10,000 pmol of total Zn2+, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2, zinc transport into the basal chamber was similar to that seen in Fig. 1. While in the control cells, 0.12 nmol of ZnCl2/cm2 were transported, in cells exposed to 50 or 100 μm ZnCl2, the nmol of ZnCl2/cm2 were 4.77 and 7.52, respectively, equivalent to 40,1577 and 2482 pmol of Zn2+ (Fig. 2,B, E, and H, and TableII). In the cell lysates as well as in the apical and basal media, Zn2+ was distributed in several peaks. Purified human and rabbit MT markers separated by HPLC chromatography eluted with a peak with retention time at 10 min (Fig.2 J). Unbound zinc had a retention time between 11.3 and 21 min (Fig. 2 K). This elution time does not exclude the possibility that part of the metal found in these fractions can also be bound in the apical and basal media to small molecules, like amino acids (i.e. cysteine and histidine) or glutathione.Table IIZinc content of the fractions obtained by HPLC chromatography of the lysates and the apical and basal media of control and metal-exposed Caco-2 cellsApicalBasalLysatesControlTRT245.8TRT40TRT129.9RT 9–11184.9RT 9–118.5RT 9–1151.9RT 11.3–2150.3RT 11.3–216.4RT 11.3–2133.950 μmZnCl2TRT2564TRT1577TRT740RT 9–11709RT 9–11345.9RT 9–11215.6RT 11.3–211756.4RT 11.3–211120.6100 μmZnCl2TRT5456TRT2482TRT1501RT 9–11910.2RT 9–11251.1RT 9–11420.1RT 11.3–214295.4RT 11.3–211955.5Values are expressed in pmol, calculated according to the amount of radioactive and cold zinc detected in the fraction of the HPLC chromatography experiment described in Fig. 2.

Retention times 9–11 correspond to the migration of the MT marker. Retention times 11.3–21 correspond to migration of the65Zn marker. Analyses of the distribution of 65Zn in the cellular lysates of the control cells with the same technique showed that part of the metal co-eluted with the MT fractions, while the rest appeared associated with proteins of different molecular weights, having retention times between 5 and 9 min (Fig. 2 C). The fraction of radioactive zinc associated with MTs increased from 51.9 pmol of Zn2+ in control cells to 215.6 and 420.1 pmol of Zn2+ in cells exposed to either 50 or 100 μmZnCl2 (Fig. 2, C, F, andI, and Table II, retention times 9–11). Interestingly, in both the apical and basal media one of the major peaks of zinc had the same retention times as the intracellular MTs and the purified MT markers (Fig. 2, retention times 9–11; compareA, B, D, E, G, and H with J), thus indicating the presence of secreted MTs. In the absence of metal exposure, zinc was present mainly as Zn-MT complexes in both the basal and the apical compartments of control cells (Fig. 2, A and B). Following exposure to increased concentrations of Zn2+ in the apical chamber, two changes in Zn2+ distribution were noted. First, there was a marked increase of the unbound form, which increased from 6.4 pmol in control cells to 1120.6 and 1955.5 pmol in cells grown in the presence of 50 and 100 μm ZnCl2, respectively (Table II and Fig. 2, retention times 13–21; compareB with E, H, and K). Second, the levels of the Zn-MT complexes in the apical media were higher than in the corresponding basal compartments and increased consistently from 184.9 pmol in control cells to 709 and 910.2 pmol in cells exposed to 50 and 100 μm ZnCl2, respectively (Table II and Fig. 2, retention times 9–11; compareA, D, and G with B,E, and H). We also found high levels of unbound zinc in the apical medium of metal-exposed cells (Fig. 2, retention times 11.3–21; D andG). Although the apical compartment was the site of loading of the metal at the beginning of the experiment, we cannot rule out the hypothesis that an aliquot was derived from a process of secretion of the cells, as suggested by pulse-chase experiments and the ability of Caco-2 cells to transport the metal from the basal to the apical compartment. 2O. Moltedo, X. Alvarez-Hernandez, and A. Leone, unpublished results. One approach to confirm the data of the secretion of MTs in the extracellular compartments obtained in the previous experiment consisted in labeling Caco-2 cells for 20 h with [35S]cysteine in presence or absence of 200 μm ZnCl2 in the apical chamber. The radioactivity present in both cell extracts and media were then analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig.3). We found that induced Caco-2 cells synthesized MTs (Fig. 3, comparelanes 1 and 2). Exposure to 200 μm ZnCl2 induced the accumulation in the apical medium of MTs (Fig. 3, compare lanes 3 and4), in agreement with the experiment of labeling with radioactive zinc described in Fig. 2. No effect was observed on the levels of MTs in the basal medium (Fig. 3, compare lanes 5 and 6). We also found the presence of discrete amounts of other cysteine-rich proteins in the apical and basal media (Fig. 3, lanes 3–6). However, these secreted proteins showed higher molecular weights compared with MTs and did not increase their biosynthesis in response to metal excess. The concurrent association of biosynthesis and secretion of MTs with the transport of zinc suggests an active role for these proteins in the mobilization of pools of the metal between the cell and the apical and basal compartments. We therefore analyzed the effect of the constitutive expression of MTs on the transport of zinc and on the distribution of MTs in the apical and basal media. Caco-2 cells were cotransfected permanently with a plasmid conferring resistance to the drug hygromycin and another plasmid expressing the mouse mMTI gene under the control of the long terminal repeat promoter of the Friend murine leukemia virus. Several clones were isolated, and one of them, CL11, was chosen for the ability to express constitutively high levels of the mMTIa isoform. Fig. 4shows the gel fractionation of proteins obtained from the metabolic labeling of the cells for 20 h with [35S]cysteine in the presence or absence of 200 μm ZnCl2supplemented from the apical compartment. CL11 cells did synthesize the mMTI constitutively (Fig. 4, lane 3); this protein migrated slightly more slowly than human MTs, as demonstrated by similar experiments performed on other murine cell lines (data not shown); following exposure to zinc, CL11 cells accumulated both mMTI and human MTs (Fig. 4, compare lane 4 withlanes 2 and 3). Analysis of the apical media from CL11 cells showed that the overexpression of the mMTI isoform allowed its constitutive secretion (Fig. 4, lane 7) and that the exposure of cells to zinc further stimulated the secretion of MTs (Fig. 4, compare lane 8 withlanes 6 and 7). In the basal medium, no major differences in the levels of MTs were observed in metal-exposed cells or controls of normal and transfected cells (data not shown). We then compared the transport of Zn2+ in the apical compartment in Caco-2 versus CL11 cells, over a period of 6 h at concentrations of 5 μm ZnCl2(control cells) and 50 or 200 μm ZnCl2, respectively (Fig. 5). In the control cells, there was no difference in the transport of 65Zn. At the higher Zn2+ concentrations in the apical chamber, CL11 cells showed a greater transport of Zn2+ into the basal chamber. Therefore, the higher intracellular levels of MTs in the transfected cells increased the mobilization of zinc from the apical toward the basal compartment, but only after exposure of the cells for several hours to zinc, suggesting that the enhancement of the transport of the metal requires the participation of different biochemical components (i.e. transporters, MT, and others), whose activity and/or biosynthesis should be, at least in part, zinc-dependent. In mammals the absorption of zinc occurs almost exclusively in the small intestine through saturable and nonsaturable mechanisms (13Cousins R.J. Physiol. Rev. 1985; 65: 238-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar, 26Chesters J.K. O'Dell B.L. Sunde R.A. Handbook of Nutritionally Essential Mineral Elements. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1997: 185-230Google Scholar). The molecular intermediates responsible for such processes have not been fully identified. The recently cloned divalent metal transporter (DMT1) (27Gunshin H. Mackenzie B. Berger U.V. Gunshin Y. Romero M.F. Boron W.F. Nussberger S. Gollan J.L. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 482-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (2667) Google Scholar) appears to be able to mediate the uptake of iron as well as other ions, including zinc (14Menard M.P. McKormick C.C. Cousins R.J. J. Nutr. 1981; 111: 1353-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Within the cells, a family of zinc transporters with different intracellular localization have been isolated: ZnT1, ZnT2, ZnT3, and ZnT4 (28Palmiter R.D. Findley S.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar, 29Palmiter R.D. Cole T.B. Findley S.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1784-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 30Palmiter R.D.

Genet. 1997; 17: 292-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). None of these transporters appear to be present exclusively in the intestine, and all display different tissue specificity. For example, ZnT3 expression is limited to the nervous system and the testis (30Palmiter R.D. Cole T.B. Quaife C.F. Findley S.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14934-14939Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). Therefore, the control of zinc homeostasis appears to be a complex mechanism, mediated in different tissues by the presence and/or the modulation of the activity of various intermediates (i.e. synthesis and activity of transporters, synthesis of zinc-binding proteins like MTs, regulation of the levels of glutathione, and others), most probably according to the need of the metal and/or to the exposure to different concentrations. We found that Caco-2 cells, a well characterized model of in vitro differentiation of human enterocytes (19Pinto M. Robine-Leon S. Appay M.D. Kedinger M. Triadou N. Dussaulx E. Lacroix B. Simon-Assman P. Haffen K. Fogh J. Zweibaun A. Biol. Cell. 1983; 47: 323-330Google Scholar), were constitutively able to transport zinc from the apical toward the basal compartment and to secrete MTs. The process of secretion of MTs appeared polarized toward the apical compartment and regulated by the concentrations of zinc in the medium; i.e. following exposure to the metal, an enhancement of both the transport of zinc toward the basal chamber and the secretion of MTs toward the apical compartment was observed. In the basal medium, HPLC chromatography showed that the greatest part of zinc was found as free metal, while a minor aliquot was bound to MTs. This is the first observation of the secretion of MTs in polarized cells. Little information is available about the mechanisms controlling the passage of leaderless secretory (LLS) proteins through membranes, and either translocation (of the plasma membrane or of intracellular membranes) or pinching off from the plasma membranes of vesicles enriched in a given LLS have been proposed (32Muesch A.

Rubartelli A. Holland B. Unusual Secretory Pathways: From Bacteria to Men. Landes Bioscience, Austin, TX1997: 87-104Google Scholar). In prokaryotes and lower eukaryotes, pathways of secretion of LLS proteins use dedicated ATP-binding cassette membrane transporters (33Rubartelli A. Sitia R. Kuchler K. Rubartelli A. Holland B. Unusual Secretory Pathways: From Bacteria to Men. Landes Bioscience, Austin, TX1997: 87-104Google Scholar). In high eukaryotes, direct evidence for the participation of the ATP-binding cassette transporters in the secretion of LLS proteins is still not available, although it has been shown that drugs such as glibenclamide that block ATP-binding cassette activity also inhibit the secretion of LLS proteins (34Andrei C. Dazzi C. Lotti L. Torrisi M.R. Chimini G. Rubartelli A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1463-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). We do not know at the moment if MTs are secreted in a metal-free or in a metal-chelated form. In the first case, we should hypothesize the existence of two distinct mechanisms, one allowing the translocation of the apo-MT across the cellular membrane and the other regulating the efflux of zinc. Reconstitution of the metal-MT would than occur by protein folding in the media, where free zinc ions would be present. According to the properties of rapid exchange of the metal from the β and α domains of MTs and to other MTs (35Nettesheim D.G. Engeseth H.R. Otvos J.D. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6744-6751Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 36Otvos J.D. Hengeseth H.R. Nettesheim D.G. Hilt C.R. Experimentia Suppl. Basel. 1987; 52: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), it is conceivable that the free and the MT-chelated zinc pools present in the apical and basal medium could be interchanged, at least in some part, and that several environmental factors (such as pH, presence of metal-binding proteins like albumin, or reducing agents) could modulate this effect. The secretion of MTs appears independent from the type of metal bound; we found that Caco-2 and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, a kidney-derived dog polarized cell line, were able to accumulate MTs in the apical medium following not only zinc, but also cadmium and copper exposure (data not shown). Other laboratories reported the presence of Zn-MTs, as well as Cu- and Cd-MTs, in the blood and urine of rodents and humans (9Bremner I. Mehra R.K. Sato M. Kägi J.H.R. Kojima Y. Metallothionein II. Birkhäuser, Basel1987: 52-507Google Scholar, 10Sato M. Mehra R.K. Bremner I. J. Nutr. 1988; 114: 1683-1689Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 11Falck F.Y. Fine L.J. Smith R.G. Garvey J. Schork A. England B. McClatchey K.D. Linton J. Br. J. Ind. Med. 1983; 40: 305-313PubMed Google Scholar), with the levels of MT dependent upon the nutritional or environmental exposure to metals. Plasma Zn-MT levels, for example, appeared to be influenced by the nutritional intake of the metal and were higher in normal zinc-fed rats than in zinc-deprived animals (10Sato M. Mehra R.K. Bremner I. J. Nutr. 1988; 114: 1683-1689Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 11Falck F.Y. Fine L.J. Smith R.G. Garvey J. Schork A. England B. McClatchey K.D. Linton J. Br. J. Ind. Med. 1983; 40: 305-313PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, we observed that the secretion of MTs was regulated not only by the extracellular concentrations of zinc, but also by the intracellular levels of the same proteins, as shown by the constitutive secretion of the mMTI protein in the stable transfected cell line CL11. Different hypotheses have been raised on the role of MTs in the control of zinc metabolism in the gut; some authors have postulated that these proteins could sequester the metal and render it unavailable for transfer to the circulating plasma (37Richards M.P. Cousins R.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1975; 64: 1215-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 38Hempe J.M. Cousins R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9671-9674Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), while others favor a more active function in the general mechanism of transport of the metal (18Jackson M.J. Jones D.A. Edwards R.H.T. Swainbank I.G. Coleman M.L. Br. J. Nutr. 1984; 51: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Our experiments show that in Caco-2 cells MTs were present in the medium and in the cells, both in basal conditions and following exposure to high concentrations of the metal. MTs bound significant levels of zinc in the apical compartment, and their presence in it increased in metal-exposed cells. In permanently transfected CL11 cells, the constitutive overexpression of the mouse mMTI protein increased the transport of the metal, but only in cells grown in presence of high concentrations of zinc. Thus, MTs per se are not able to mobilize the metal, but they contribute to its transport, with a need for other yet not characterized metal-dependent biochemical mechanisms. These mechanisms might include, for example, an increase in the kinetics of transporters or the stimulation of the activities of metal chaperones. Interestingly, evidence of metal-mediated trafficking of proteins has already been reported; both the Menkes (ATP7A) and the Wilson (ATP7B) proteins, two copper-binding P-type ATPases that regulate the efflux of the metal, mobilize toward an endosomal compartment after increase of the extracellular concentrations of copper (39Petris M.J. Mercer J.F.B. Culvenor J.G. Lockhart P. Gleeson P.A. Camakaris J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6084-6095Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 40Payne A.S. Kelly E.J. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10854-10859Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Similar conclusions for a role of MT to act as a zinc pool have been suggested by Davis et al. (41Davis S.R. McMahon R.J. Cousins R.J. J. Nutr. 1998; 128: 825-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In MT transgenic mice containing a high number of copies of the mMT-I gene in their genome, the elevated levels of the protein were not associated with greater intestinal zinc accumulation, while in MT knock out mice zinc treatment increased the intestinal zinc concentration significantly compared with the zinc-treated animals. In the latter case, the absence of MT would explain the elevated levels of zinc found in the serum and in the intestine, possibly due to an inefficient mucosa-to-lumen flux. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the exposure of the apical membrane of Caco-2 cells to high levels of zinc achieves at the same time three different, important effects on the cellular metabolism of the metal. First, Zn2+ activates the transport machinery. Second, Zn2+ enhances the accumulation of MTs, which contributes in zinc-exposed cells to an increase in the transport of the metal, as shown by the experiments of the overexpression of the mMTI protein. Third, Zn2+ increases the levels of secreted MTs, especially into the apical compartment. In vivo, these tightly regulated molecular mechanisms would coordinately link two important aspects of the metabolism of zinc in intestinal cells: the increased absorption in the presence of high levels of metal in the diet and the removal of the excess of zinc as a MT-chelated form in the lumen of intestine (Fig. 6).

Many signaling pathways do so by altering the phosphorylation state of the target proteins. Kinases and phosphatases have broad substrate specificity, and mechanisms exist to organize and effectively concentrate the correct repertoires of enzymes into distinct signaling cascades. In the case of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA),1 the importance of signal integration and coordinated assembly of signaling cascades has been established (1Colledge M. Scott J.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 216-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar).

Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 172-177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). It is the regulatory subunits of PKA that mediate subcellular compartmentalization via their binding to A-Kinaseanchoring proteins (AKAPs) (6Scott J.D. McCartney S. Mol.

More recently, the structural basis for this high affinity interaction was revealed by solution NMR (3Newlon M.N. Roy M. Morikis D. Hausken Z.E. Coghlan V. Scott J.D. Jennings P.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 222-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The X-type four helix bundle topology in RIIα-(1–44) provides a hydrophobic interaction surface for an amphipathic helical motif in the AKAPs (3Newlon M.N. Roy M. Morikis D. Hausken Z.E. Coghlan V.

RIIα, however, binds this class of proteins with a 25–500-fold higher affinity than RI (2Huang L.J. Durick K. Weiner J.A. Chun J. Taylor S.S. J. Biol.

Recently, a novel Caenorhabditis elegans AKAP that bindsC. elegans R-subunit, RCE, has been cloned (21Angelo R. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14633-14643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). AKAPCE binds RCE with nanomolar affinity, and neither RIIα nor RIIβ competitively inhibit formation of AKAPCE-RCE complexes. These studies suggest that RIα dimers, like RIIα, have a site available for interactions for anchoring proteins. Although RIα is mostly cytoplasmic in certain cell types, it is clearly anchored in vivo (22Rubin C.S. Erlichman J. Rosen O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 6135-6139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Robinson M.L. Wallert M.A. Reinitz C.A. Shabb J.B. Arch. Biochem.

Science. 1994; 263: 84-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The dynamic nature of RIα anchoring, in contrast to the static anchoring of RIIα, is of critical importance in vivo and needs to be understood at the molecular as well as the structural level. The recent solution NMR structure of the RIIα dimerization/docking domain (D/D) revealed an X-type four-helix bundle topology (3Newlon M.N. Roy M. Morikis D. Hausken Z.E. Coghlan V. Scott J.D. Jennings P.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 222-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Although one would expect a conserved fold among these family members, the differential affinities to the various AKAPs and other target proteins, and the absence of disulfide bonds in RII suggests that there are potentially some subtle, yet critical, structural differences dictating different mechanisms of homodimerization and AKAP interactions. We bacterially expressed, 13C/15N isotopically enriched, and purified a 50-residue fragment, corresponding to the D/D domain of RIα. Residues 12–61 of RIα were previously identified as the tryptic core responsible for dimerization (26Leon D.A. Herberg F.W. Banky P. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28431-28437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This region is highly stable and is capable of binding thed-AKAPs (2Huang L.J. Durick K. Weiner J.A.

We report here the 1H,15N, and 13C backbone resonance assignments and secondary structure analysis of uniformly 15N- and13C-enriched RIα (12–61), as determined by multidimensional NMR techniques. Like RIIα-(1–45), this region contains two regions of α-helical structure separated by a turn. A key difference, however, is observed when the secondary structures are compared. The extreme NH2 terminus in RIIα-(1–44) is extended, however, in RIα-(12–61), this region is helical. This altered structural element in RIα-(12–61) at the extreme NH2 terminus has implications for the unique quaternary contacts in RIα and affects homodimerization as well as AKAP binding. cDNA encoding recombinant RIα-(1–61) was inserted into the EcoRI site of pRSETc (Invitrogen, Inc.). This construct introduced a His6 tag at the amino terminus and allowed for rapid purification of the expressed protein by Ni2+ affinity chromatography. Residues 12–61, identified previously as the trypsin-resistant core, were then purified to homogeneity by gel filtration and high performance liquid chromatography (26Leon D.A. Herberg F.W. Banky P. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28431-28437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The gene encoding RIα-(1–61) contains two rare arginine codons for expression in Escherichia colithat significantly compromised bacterial expression. Once the plasmid encoding the rare Arg codon, dnaY, was supplied, expression was dramatically enhanced (28Garcia G.M. Mar P.K. Mullin D.A. Walker J.R. Prather N.E. Cell. 1986; 45: 453-459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 29Brinkmann U. Mattes R.E. Buckel P. Gene (Amst. ). 1989; 85: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). For obtaining unlabeled RIα-(12–61) the expression plasmid was transformed into BL21-DE3 (dnaY) cells (100 μg/ml ampicillin; 70 μg/ml kanamycin). LB media (4–6 liters) were then inoculated with a growing culture that had reached anA 600 of 0.5–0.6. The culture was grown at 37 °C to an A 600 of 0.6–0.8 prior to induction with 1 mm IPTG. The cells were grown for an additional 5 h and then harvested by centrifugation for 11 min at 5000 rpm. Maximum expression of 15N-labeled protein was obtained using growth media that contained M9 salts (30Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar) to which 1 μm FeCl3, 25 μmZnSO4, 0.1 mm CaCl2, and 0.5 mm MgSO4, and 20 ml/liter vitamin supplements (Life Technologies, Inc.) were added. Cell growth was initiated by inoculating a 50-ml culture of 2XYT with an expression cell stock to mid-log phase (A 600 of 0.4–0.6) and then harvesting and dissolving in 500 μl of minimal media containing antibiotics. This was then used to inoculate 6–8 liters of prewarmed M9 salts/glucose media (250 μl/liter). The culture was grown at 37 °C to an A 600 of 0.5–0.6 prior to induction with 1 mm IPTG. The cells were grown for an additional 5 h post-induction and then harvested by centrifugation for 11 min at 5000 rpm. 13C/15N isotopically labeled protein was expressed in 13C/15N Celtone medium, Celtone CN (Martek Biosciences, Inc.) in a 2.5-liter fermentor flask using the Bioflo3000 (New Brunswick, Inc.) Cells were grown at 37 °C, pH 7.4. pH was controlled with 5n NaOH and 5 n H2SO4. Dissolved oxygen level was maintained at 30% by setting an agitation/dissolved oxygen cascade with an agitation range of 300–800 rpm. Cells were induced with 1 mm IPTG at anA 600 of 0.9 and dissolved oxygen of 28% and grown for an additional 5 h. Cells were resuspended in buffer A (50 mm potassium phosphate, 300 mmsodium chloride, pH 8.0, at 4 °C) and lysed by passing through a French pressure cell twice. The cellular debris was then removed by centrifugation for 40 min at 15,000 rpm. The supernatant was batch bound to Ni2+ or Co 2+ resin (Invitrogen, Inc.; CLONTECH, Inc.) that had been pre-equilibrated with buffer A. The protein was purified as described previously (26Leon D.A. Herberg F.W. Banky P. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28431-28437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). RIα-(12–61) was >95% pure as assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Complete cleavage of the fusion protein was confirmed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometric analysis (ESI) as well as by NH2-terminal sequencing. Protein concentration was determined by quantitative amino acid analysis. Optimal sample conditions were established and assessed by analytical gel filtration, dynamic light scattering, as well as two-dimensional homonuclear TOCSY experiments (31Newlon M.G. Roy M. Hausken Z.E. Scott J.D. Jennings P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23637-23644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The optimal buffer conditions were determined to be 50 mm sodium acetate, 150 mmsodium chloride at pH 4.0, and the ideal temperature was at 37 °C. All NMR experiments were performed at 37 °C on either a Bruker DMX500 or a DRX600 spectrometer using a triple-resonance gradient probe. All homonuclear experiments were done using the same sample as described for the two-dimensional TOCSY experiments. Two-dimensional homonuclear NOESY experiments (32Jeener T. Meier B.H. Bachman P. Ernst R.R. J. Chem. Phys. 1979; 71: 4546-4553Crossref Scopus (4845) Google Scholar) were collected with mixing times of 150 ms. The 1H spectral widths were 6944 Hz (12 ppm) in t2 and t1. 2000 by 512 points were collected. Water suppression was achieved through a WATERGATE sequence (33Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol.

The 1H chemical shift of water was 4.717 ppm when referenced to sodium 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate, while 15N and 13C were indirectly referenced to NH3(liquid) and 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate, respectively, as established by Wishart et al.

Soc. 1993; 115: 772-777Google Scholar) were acquired on the same 15N-labeled sample. In all experiments, the 1H carrier during the evolution of the15N and 1H dimensions was centered at the water frequency, but was shifted to 7.857 ppm before data acquisition. In all experiments, the 15N carrier was placed at 118 ppm. A mixing time of 150 ms was used for the HSQC-NOESY, and the HSQC-TOCSY experiment was run at spin lock time of 97 ms for optimal magnetization transfer. In all cases, water suppression was accomplished using the WATERGATE sequence (33Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3539) Google Scholar, 40Sklenar V. Piotto M. Leppik R. Saudek V. J. Magn. Reson. 1993; 102: 241-245Crossref Scopus (1116) Google Scholar). Broadband 15N decoupling for the three 1H-15N experiments was done using a WALTZ16 decoupling scheme (41Bax A. Davis D.G. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 65: 355-360Google Scholar). In the two-dimensional HSQC experiment, 256 real t1 (15N) and 512 complex t2 (1H) points were collected with spectral widths of 1277 Hz (21 ppm) and 2315 Hz (4 ppm), respectively. For the three-dimensional 1H-15N experiments, a total of 128 complex t1 (1H), 64 complex t2 (15N), and 512 complex t3(1H) points were collected. The spectral widths were 5109 Hz (8.5 ppm) (t1), 1277 Hz (21 ppm) (t2) and 2404 (4 ppm) (t3). For the three-dimensional HNHA experiment, a total of 32 complex t1 (15N), 64 complex t2 (1H), and 512 complex t3(1H) points were collected. The spectral widths were 1277 Hz (t1), 6001.3 Hz (10 ppm) (t2), and 2404 Hz (4 ppm) (t3). The HNHA experiment was used to calculateJ HN-Hα coupling constants. Coupling constants were determined based on the intensity ratio of the cross-peak to the diagonal (39Vuister G.W. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 772-777Google Scholar, 42Brunger A.T. Karplus M.

The 1H carrier was placed either at the water frequency throughout the entire experiment (HNCAB, CBCA(CO)NH), or shifted to 7.857 ppm as in the case of the CT-HNCA experiment or shifted to 2.3 ppm as in the HCCH-TOCSY experiment, prior to data acquisition. The 13C carrier was set to either 43 ppm (HNCACB, HCCH-TOCSY) or 54.87ppm (HNCA). In the CBCA(CO)NH experiment, the 13C carrier originated at 43 ppm, but once magnetization was transferred to 13C′, the carrier was shifted to 177 ppm. When the 13C carrier was at 43 ppm,13C′ pulses were achieved using off-resonance phase-shifted laminar pulses (50Patt S.L. J. Magn. Reson. 1992; 96: 94-102Google Scholar). WALTZ16 (41Bax A.

The WATERGATE sequence was used to suppress the water signal in the CT-HNCA experiment. The 15N carrier was placed at 118 ppm. The total number of points collected for the CBCA(CO)NH experiment was 50 complex t1 (15N), 70 complex t2 (13C), and 1024 complex t3 (1H), and the spectral widths were 1581 Hz (26 ppm) t1, 9054Hz (60ppm) (t2) and 7788Hz (13ppm) (t3). In the HNCA experiment, 48 real t1 (15N), 64 real t2(13C), and 512 complex t3 (1H) points were collected at spectral widths of 1318 Hz (26 ppm) (t1), 4024 Hz (32 ppm) (t2), and 3005 Hz (6 ppm) (t1). The total number of points collected for the HNCACB experiment was 50 complex t1 (15N), 66 complex t2 (13C), and 1024 complex t3 (1H); the spectral widths were 7788 Hz (13 ppm) (t3), 9054Hz (60 ppm) (t2), and 1581 Hz (26 ppm) (t1). The HCCH-TOCSY experiment was acquired with 128 real t1 (1H), 128 real t2(13C), and 512 complex t3 (1H) and 6001 Hz (10 ppm) t1, 10,111 Hz (67 ppm) t2, and 3592 Hz (6 ppm) t3 spectral widths. The total number of points collected for the three-dimensional13C-edited HMQC-NOESY was 80 complex t1(1H), 64 complex t2 (13C), and 512 complex t3 (1H) with spectral widths of 6601 Hz (11ppm) (t1), 9054 Hz (60 ppm) (t2), and 6613 Hz (11 ppm) (t3). Quadrature phase detection in the indirectly detected dimension for all homonuclear experiments and the triple resonance CT-HNCA experiment was obtained via time-proportional phase incrementation (53Marion D. Wuthrich K. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1983; 113: 608-613Google Scholar). The three-dimensional 15N heteronuclear experiments used sensitivity enhanced gradient-detected echo/antiecho in the15N dimension, and the CBCA(CO)NH used STATES (54)in the13C dimension. Amide proton exchange experiments were carried out on a 1 mm protein sample originally in 50 mm sodium acetate, 150 mm sodium chloride buffer, 90% H2O/10%D2O, pH 4.0, which was exchanged into 50 mm deuterated sodium acetate buffer, 100% D2O, pH 3.6, using Quick SpinTM Protein Columns (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Inc.). Two-dimensional HSQC experiments, matrix size 512 × 64, were run at times of 10 min, 30 min, 2 h, 7 h, and 25 h after exchange into D2O. All experiments were processed using Felix 95.0 software (MSI, San Diego, CA) using an Indigo-2 workstation (Silicon Graphics, Inc.). The data were apodized with a squared sine-bell function shifted by 70° in all dimensions before Fourier transformation. For all three-dimensional experiments, linear prediction to additional one-third of the number of the points collected was applied before apodization in both t1 and t2. Circular dichroism (CD) spectra were measured in 50 mm sodium acetate and 150 mm sodium chloride at pH 4.0 as well as in 50 mm potassium phosphate, 150 mm sodium chloride, pH 6.5 at 37 °C and 25 °C on an Aviv model 202 Spectrometer (Aviv Associates). Spectra were measured with a 1 nm bandwidth, 0.2 nm step size, and a 100-ms time constant over a wavelength range of 185–260 nm in a 0.05-cm optical cell. Gel filtration chromatography was performed on a Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Superdex-75 column, 30 cm by 10 mm. Samples of RIα-(12–61) (100 μl, at 1.0 mg/ml) were injected onto a column that had been pre-equilibrated either in 50 mm potassium phosphate, 150 mmsodium chloride, pH 6.5, or in 50 mm sodium acetate, 150 mm sodium chloride, pH 4.0. The flow rate was 0.4 ml/min and the column effluent monitored at A 280 nm. The column was calibrated with Amersham Pharmacia Biotech low molecular weight markers. Full-length RIα is a dimeric protein of 98 kDa molecular mass (55Bubis J. Vedvick T.S. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14961-14966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal 61 residues are responsible for maintaining the integrity of the dimer as well as d-AKAP interactions (2Huang L.J. Durick K. Weiner J.A. Chun J. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8057-8064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 27Banky P. Huang L.J. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35048-35055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Initial two-dimensional homonuclear TOCSY experiments (41Bax A. Davis D.G. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 65: 355-360Google Scholar) of RIα-(12–61) were acquired in 50 mm potassium phosphate at pH 6.5. The efficiency of TOCSY transfer, under these conditions, is extremely poor (data not shown). The protein had an apparent molecular mass of 18 kDa at pH 6.5 (actual molecular mass of the dimeric fragment = 10 kDa), as determined by gel filtration chromatography, suggesting a higher order association. Moreover, dynamic light scattering indicated a heterogenously dispersed sample (data not shown). A variety of buffer conditions were screened to determine the optimal sample conditions. The ideal sample conditions were observed at a pH of 4.0 and 150 mm sodium chloride (Fig. 1 A). Under these conditions, the extent of magnetization transfer in the two-dimensional TOCSY was dramatically improved. These conditions were thus chosen for future NMR studies. Even though working at low pH conditions is preferred for NMR studies due to lower amide exchange rates, there is a potential risk of compromising the structural integrity of the protein under study. To address this issue, RIα-(12–61) was analyzed by circular CD to monitor the overall secondary structure. At both pH 6.5 and pH 4.0, the spectra show the classical double minima at 210 and 222 nm expected for helical structures in solution. In addition, the spectra are similar under the two different buffer conditions, suggesting the absence of any gross structural changes due to the different solution conditions (Fig. 1 B). Additionally, the functionality of this domain is preserved at these buffer conditions, as indicated by analysis of peptide binding by NMR (61Banky P. Biochemical and Structural Characterization of the Type Ia Dimerization/Docking Domain of PKA. Ph.D. dissertation. University of California San Diego, San Diego, CA2000Google Scholar). The two-dimensional1H-15N HSQC of RIα-(12–61) is shown in Fig.2. All 47 expected non-proline backbone resonances, excluding the NH2-terminal serine were observed. The spectrum is well dispersed and well resolved. Even though RIα-(12–61) is a disulfide-bonded covalent dimer, the number of resonances observed is equivalent to the number of backbone resonances expected for a monomeric RIα-(12–61). Therefore, it is inferred that RIα-(12–61) is indeed in a stable, symmetric homodimeric conformation. In a dimeric system it can be difficult to distinguish inter- from intraresidue NOEs (56Nilges M.

Recently, synapsin I has been found to bind the Src homology 3 (SH3) domains of Grb2 and c-Src. In this work we have analyzed the interactions between synapsins and an array of SH3 domains belonging to proteins involved in signal transduction, cytoskeleton assembly, or endocytosis. The binding of synapsin I was specific for a subset of SH3 domains. The highest binding was observed with SH3 domains of c-Src, phospholipase C-gamma, p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, full-length and NH(2)-terminal Grb2, whereas binding was moderate with the SH3 domains of amphiphysins I/II, Crk, alpha-spectrin, and NADPH oxidase factor p47(phox) and negligible with the SH3 domains of p21(ras) GTPase-activating protein and COOH-terminal Grb2. Distinct sites in the proline-rich COOH-terminal region of synapsin I were found to be involved in binding to the various SH3 domains. Synapsin II also interacted with SH3 domains with a partly distinct binding pattern. Phosphorylation of synapsin I in the COOH-terminal region by Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II or mitogen-activated protein kinase modulated the binding to the SH3 domains of amphiphysins I/II, Crk, and alpha-spectrin without affecting the high affinity interactions. The SH3-mediated interaction of synapsin I with amphiphysins affected the ability of synapsin I to interact with actin and synaptic vesicles, and pools of synapsin I and amphiphysin I were shown to associate in isolated nerve terminals. The ability to bind multiple SH3 domains further implicates the synapsins in signal transduction and protein-protein interactions at the nerve terminal level."

Here, we identify regulatory elements in the Rpe65 gene and demonstrate their functional relevance to Rpe65 gene expression. We show that the 5′ flanking region of the mouse Rpe65 gene, like the human gene, lacks a canonical TATA box and consensus GC and CAAT boxes. The mouse and human genes do share several cis-acting elements, including an octamer, a nuclear factor one (NFI) site, and two E-box sites, suggesting a conserved mode of regulation. A mouseRpe65 promoter/β-galactosidase transgene containing bases –655 to +52 (TR4) of the mouse 5′ flanking region was sufficient to direct high RPE-specific expression in transgenic mice, whereas shorter fragments (–297 to +52 or –188 to +52) generated only background activity. Furthermore, transient transfection of analogous TR4/luciferase constructs also directed high reporter activity in the human RPE cell line D407 but weak activity in the non-RPE cell lines HeLa, HepG2, and HS27. Functional binding of potential transcription factors to the octamer sequence, AP-4, and NFI sites was demonstrated by directed mutagenesis, electrophoretic mobility shift assay, and cross-linking. Mutations of these sites abolished binding and corresponding transcriptional activity and indicated that octamer and E-box transcription factors synergistically regulate the RPE65 promoter function.

RPE65 is specific to the vertebrate RPE and is also highly conserved at the level of protein sequence. Previous data suggest a complex transcriptional and translational regulation of RPE65. At the transcriptional level, our knowledge is limited (22Nicoletti A. Kawase K. Thompson D.A. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1998; 39: 637-644PubMed Google Scholar), and we lack functional evidence concerning the transcriptional elements involved in the activation of the gene and in its specific expression in the RPE. Transcription ofRpe65 appears to be developmentally regulated, with the protein first appearing at about postnatal day 4 in the rat (11Hamel C.P. Tsilou E. Harris E. Pfeffer B.A. Hooks J.J.

Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (reverse transcription-PCR) analysis of RPE65 in embryonic and newborn rat suggests a biphasic induction of RPE65 mRNA expression (20Manes G. Leducq R.

At the level of translation, we have found that a 170-nucleotide region of the RPE65 3′ untranslated region acts as a translational inhibition element (23Liu S.Y. Redmond T.M. Arch. Biochem.

Also, when RPE cells are explanted into culture, they lose expression of RPE65 protein within 2 weeks, although the expression of RPE65 mRNA can continue (10Hamel C.P. Tsilou E.

Here, we present the sequence of the 5′ flanking region of the mouseRpe65 gene and indicate its similarity to the corresponding human gene region. We have generated transgenic mice containingRpe65 promoter-reporter constructs and show that theRpe65 5′flanking region –655 to +52 can drivelacZ reporter gene expression specifically in the RPE. In addition, we show that this fragment also displays a high transcriptional activity in D407 RPE cells in vitro. Furthermore, by directed mutagenesis, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), and cross-linking, we demonstrate functional binding of transcription factors to an octamer sequence and AP-4 and NFI sites and show their importance to the transcriptional regulation of the mouseRpe65 gene. A P1 clone containing the complete mouse Rpe65 gene was isolated (Genomic Systems, St. Louis, MO). Restriction fragments containing the 5′ region of the mouseRpe65 gene were identified by Southern blot hybridization to a random-primed 32P-labeled bovine cDNA 5′ end probe (10Hamel C.P. Tsilou E. Pfeffer B.A. Hooks J.J. Detrick B. Redmond T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15751-15757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). pBluescript subclones containing the 5′ region of theRpe65 gene were sequenced. One such clone, E1–12, was found to contain the first three exons of mouse Rpe65, as well as 2.8 kilobase pairs of 5′ flanking region. This was compared with the sequence of the 5′ flanking region of the human RPE65 gene, obtained in the same way (15Marlhens F. Bareil C. Griffoin J.M. Zrenner E. Amalric P. Eliaou C. Liu S.Y. Harris E. Redmond T.M. Arnaud B. Claustres M. Hamel C.P. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 139-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar), using the GeneWorks 2.5 and MacVector 6.5 sequence analysis programs (Oxford Molecular, Beaverton, OR). For transgenic mice, three constructs, TR2, TR3, and TR4, containing sequences included in the mouse 5′ flanking region, were amplified. For amplification, oligonucleotide primer pairs containing HindIII restriction sites at their 5′ ends were used. The forward oligonucleotide primers used were (restriction sites underlined) as follows: TR4, 5′-CCCAAGCTTGCAATGGTGAAGACAGTGA-3′; TR3, 5′-CCCAAGCTTTACAGTGAGGATAACAGCA-3′; and TR2, 5′CCCAAGCTTGATCCAAGTCTGGAAAATA-3′. The common reverse primer used was 5′-CCCAAGCTTCTTCCAGTGAAGATTAGAG-3′. These fragments were digested with HindIII and subcloned into HindIII-digested pCH126A2 plasmid (24Goring D.R. Rossant J. Clapoff S. Breitman M.L. Tsui L.C. Science. 1987; 235: 456-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) containing an E. coli lacZ gene and simian virus 40 polyadenylation signal sequences. For transient transfection luciferase assay, constructs TR3 and TR4 were inserted into the plasmid pGL3-Basic (Promega, Madison, WI). The forward primers were the same as those used to amplify TR3 and TR4 fragments during the production of transgenic mice. The common reverse primer also overlapped with the primer used before, but it lacked four bases at the 3′ end. Mutations were introduced by DNA amplification using QuickChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). A total of four site-directed mutants using the pTR4luc plasmid as a template were generated. These were named m1AP4, mNFI, m2AP4, and mOct. 11 additional constructs, as well, containing combinatorial mutations in two, three, or all of the cited elements were created using single, double, or triple mutants as a template, respectively. Mutated oligonucleotides used for DNA amplification are shown in Table II. The introduction of mutations was verified by DNA sequencing.Table IIOligonucleotides used for EMSA and directed mutagenesisNamePositionSequence (5′-3′)Oct-1−515 to −475GATAGCAGGGTTAAAACATGCAAAGACAGCACCTCATATACOct-1m−515 to −475–––––––––––––––––CCA––CCA––––––––––––––––2AP-4−271 to −237GATGACTGAGGTCAGCTCAGGACTGCATGGCAGGC2AP-4m−271 to −237––––––––––––––AT–A–TT––––––––––––––NFI−187 to −155ATCCAAGTCTGGAAAATAGCCAAAACACTGTTANFIm−187 to −155––––––––––––––––––TAA––––––––––––EBNA-1AATTGAGCTCGGTACCCGGGGATCCTATCTGGGTAGCATATGCTATCCTAATGGATCCTCTAGAGTCGACCTGGAGGCATGC1AP-4−102 to −64CTTTTGTTACCTTCCATCAGCTGAGGGGTGGAGAGGGTTC1AP-4m−102 to −64––––––––––––––––––CATC––A–––––––––––––––1AP-4–5Br−64 to −102GAACCC5C5CCACCCC5CAGC5GA5GGAAGG5AACAAAAGRespective binding sequences are in boldface.

DNA constructs were microinjected into the male pronuclei of single cell FVB/N mouse embryos, which were implanted into pseudopregnant CD1 foster mothers, using standard techniques. Transgenic founder mice and their progeny were identified by PCR of a region common to all of the transgenes. For some founders, copy number was estimated by Southern blot analysis ofPstI-digested genomic DNA hybridized with a lacZgene probe. Transgenic founders were bred to CD1 mice to generate F1 progeny. β-Galactosidase (β-gal) reporter gene activity was assayed using the chemiluminescent Galacto-Light Plus assay (Tropix/PE Applied Biosystems, Bedford, MA). Eyes were dissected into three parts: the anterior segment, comprising the cornea, iris, and ciliary body; the posterior segment, comprising the retina, RPE, choroid, and sclera; and the lens. Noneye tissues assayed were brain, liver, lung, heart, kidney, and spleen. For histochemistry, tissues were fixed for 1 h in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and washed three times in 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) rinse buffer (100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.3, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.01% sodium deoxycholate, 0.02% Nonidet P-40). The eyes were stained overnight in a solution of 2 mg/ml X-gal in X-gal rinse buffer containing 5 mm each potassium ferrocyanide and potassium ferricyanide. After staining, tissues were postfixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in methacrylate. Sections were cut at a thickness of 5 μm, counterstained with neutral red, and evaluated for presence of blue product. In addition, stained eyes were postfixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and dissected to remove anterior segment, lens, and retina. The resultant eyecup was quartered and flat-mounted in 50% glycerol for an en face preparation of the RPE/choroid/sclera complex. The human retinal pigment epithelium cell line D407 was obtained from Richard C. Hunt (25Davis A.A. Bernstein P.S. Bok D. Turner J. Nachtigal M. Hunt R.C. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1995; 36: 955-964PubMed Google Scholar) and grown in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 3% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. HeLa, HepG2, and HS27 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and grown in the same medium as used for D407 except that the concentration of fetal bovine serum was 10%. Approximately 2.5 × 105 cells were plated onto six-well tissue culture dishes and allowed to grow for 48–72 h (until 80–90% confluent). To correct for differences in transfection efficiency, 2 μg of each luciferase plasmid and 90 ng of pSV40/β-gal were added to the cells in a solution containing Superfect transfectant (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). Luciferase and β-gal reporter gene activities were assayed using the Dual-Light reporter gene assay (Tropix/PE Applied Biosystems, Bedford, MA). The ratio of luciferase activity to β-gal activity in each sample served as a measure of normalized luciferase activity. Experiments were performed in triplicate at least four times. Nuclear extracts from D407 and freshly dissected RPE bovine cells were prepared by the method of Dignam et al.(26Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9149) Google Scholar). For EMSA, double-stranded oligonucleotides (Table II) were labeled with polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]dATP (6000 Ci/mmol). Approximately 15 μg of nuclear extract were added to binding buffer (33 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 166 mmNaCl, 1.6 mm dithiothreitol), 4 μg of poly(dI-dC), 0.04% Nonidet P-40, 8% glycerol, and 32P-labeled probe (30,000–50,000 cpm) and incubated at room temperature 30 min. For the competition assay, a 50–2000-fold molar excess of unlabeled wild type, mutant, or nonspecific competitor oligonucleotide was used along with the labeled probe. The DNA-protein complexes were resolved on 5% polyacrylamide gels in 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA buffer and visualized by autoradiography. For antibody supershifts, nuclear extracts were incubated with 1 μl of CTF/NFI polyclonal antibody (provided by Naoko Tanese) or 4 μl of α-Oct-1 monoclonal antibody (provided by Winship Herr, isotype IgG1, κ) for 1 h at room temperature prior to addition of labeled probe. Corresponding preimmune serum was used as a control in the NFI supershift assay. Medium containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics and an Oct-2 antibody (provided by Winship Herr) with the same isotype as the α-Oct-1 antibody were used as controls in the supershift assays. For cross-linking experiments, thymidines were substituted by 5-bromo-deoxyuridine in one oligonucleotide strand. After incubation with the probe in the same conditions described above, samples were cross-linked for 10 min under UV radiation in a Strata-linker. For molecular weight determinations, samples were electrophoresed on a 12% polyacrylamide-Tris-HCl gel (Bio-Rad) in 1× Tris-glycine-SDS buffer. We have sequenced approximately 2.8 kilobase pairs of 5′ flanking region upstream of the putative transcription start site of the mouse Rpe65 gene (Fig.1 A; numbered +1 based on homology with the human gene (22Nicoletti A. Kawase K. Thompson D.A. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1998; 39: 637-644PubMed Google Scholar)) and searched for sequences evolutionarily conserved between the mouse and humanRpe65/RPE65 genes 5′ flanking regions. When 2.8 kilobase pairs of the 5′ flanking region of the mouse and humanRpe65/RPE65 genes were compared by dot matrix analysis, a diagonal of similarity was seen distally to approximately –1200 with a short region of similarity closer to the 5′ end of each segment (data not shown). The proximal 628 and 581 nucleotides of the human and mouse 5′ flanking regions, respectively, and 5′ untranslated regions were compared by ClustalW alignment (Fig. 1 B). Many conserved blocks of sequence were noted between the two, including NFI (at –178 to –165), octamer (at –498 to –491), and two E-box consensus (at –84 to –79 and –257 to –252) binding sites. The overall homology is over 70%. A possible site homologous to the human CRALBP gene (27Kennedy B.N. Goldflam S. Chang M.A. Campochiaro P. Davis A.A. Zack D.J. Crabb J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5591-5598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) element, noted by Nicoletti et al. (22Nicoletti A. Kawase K. Thompson D.A. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1998; 39: 637-644PubMed Google Scholar) in the humanRPE65 5′ flanking region is present at –72 to –63 in the mouse Rpe65 5′ flanking region. This element, however, is not represented in the mouse CRALBP gene promoter. The NFI site in both genes has a similar intervening nonconsensus sequence (AAA(T/C)A) only seen previously in the human RPE65 gene (22Nicoletti A. Kawase K. Thompson D.A. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1998; 39: 637-644PubMed Google Scholar), but the consensus binding half-sites (TGGA-N5-GCCA) match perfectly with the CTF/NFI family consensus. The two E-box sites are consensus basic helix-loop-helix (HLH) protein binding sites, although Nicolettiet al. (22Nicoletti A. Kawase K. Thompson D.A. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1998; 39: 637-644PubMed Google Scholar) specifically ascribed them to AP-4. An octamer sequence was also identified in both promoters; they differed by only one nucleotide from the consensus octamer sequence ATGCAAAT. Both human and mouse genes lack consensus GC and CAAT boxes. A possible TATA box was identified at –27 to –20 in the human gene (22Nicoletti A. Kawase K. Thompson D.A. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1998; 39: 637-644PubMed Google Scholar), although, as in the mouse gene, it is somewhat deviated from consensus (28Wobbe C.R. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3859-3867Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 29Singer V.L. Wobbe C.R. Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 636-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In addition, sequences similar to motifs found in other retina-specific genes, including interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP) (30Bobola N. Hirsch E. Albini A. Altruda F. Noonan D. Ravazzolo R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1289-1294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and CRALBP (27Kennedy B.N. Goldflam S. Chang M.A. Campochiaro P. Davis A.A. Zack D.J. Crabb J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5591-5598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), were identified. Although similar sequences were found in the human RPE65 gene proximal promoter (22Nicoletti A. Kawase K. Thompson D.A. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1998; 39: 637-644PubMed Google Scholar), it is not yet clear what role, if any, these play in the overall activity of the Rpe65 gene. To identify sequence elements and transcriptional factors responsible of Rpe65 expression, we first determined the minimal Rpe65 promoter sequence necessary for the in vivo specific expression of the Rpe65 gene in the RPE. We made three constructs containing the upstream sequence of theRpe65 gene coupled to the lacZ gene/SV40 poly(A) signal sequence, and we analyzed their corresponding β-gal activity in transgenic mice. These contained the following sequence positions (construct name in parentheses): –188 to +52 (TR2), –297 to +52 (TR3), and –655 to +52 (TR4). Microinjection of these constructs into fertilized oocytes resulted in the generation of several founder lines for each construct. Copy number was estimated by comparing the hybridization signal of probe with genomic DNA from transgenic mice to serial dilutions of a known quantity of the relevant linearized construct. The number of founders analyzed and the number of copies and β-gal expression levels of each construct are presented in Table I.Table Iβ-Gal activity in transgenic mouse linesConstructFoundern 1-aNumber of mice analyzed.Copy no. 1-bNumber of transgene copies integrated.PS-βgal 1-cβ-Gal expression in the posterior segment (PS) of the eye. +++, +, and − represent comparison of β-gal activity. +++, high expression; +, low expression; −, no expression.Ectopic 1-dEctopic β-gal expression in non-RPE tissues.TR246ND 1-eND, value not determined.−−TR38121−−12101−Retina94ND−−TR4362+++−6302+++Cerebellum1843ND+++−1901ND+−1-a Number of mice analyzed.1-b Number of transgene copies integrated.1-c β-Gal expression in the posterior segment (PS) of the eye. +++, +, and − represent comparison of β-gal activity. +++, high expression; +, low expression; −, no expression.1-d Ectopic β-gal expression in non-RPE tissues.1-e ND, value not determined. Open table in a new tab Although RPE65 has been shown to be expressed specifically in the RPE of the eye and is not found in nonocular tissues (11Hamel C.P. Tsilou E. Harris E. Pfeffer B.A. Hooks J.J. Detrick B. Redmond T.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 34: 414-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), we surveyed expression of RPE65 promoter-lacZ gene constructs in a variety of tissues. We assayed eye tissues (the anterior segment, comprising the cornea, iris and ciliary body; the posterior segment, comprising the retina, RPE, choroid, and sclera; and the lens) and noneye tissues (brain, heart, lung, liver, kidney, and spleen) from transgenic and nontransgenic F1 or F2 littermates for β-gal activity. We found that the constructs pTR2lacZ (–188/+52, not shown) and pTR3lacZ (–297/+52) produced only background β-gal activity in control or transgenic animals in all tissues assayed (Fig.2 A). However, the longest construct pTR4lacZ (–655/+52) exhibited an average of about 15-fold higher β-gal activity than the control in the posterior segment, but no significant difference in other ocular and nonocular tissues (Fig. 2 B). The values obtained for TR3 (progeny of founder 12) are shown in Fig. 2 A, and those obtained for TR4 (progeny of founder 3) are shown in Fig. 2 B. Concerning TR4, very similar values were obtained for F1 progeny of founder 6 and 184, but founder 190 had values 75% lower than these. Discernible staining was seen only in the eyes of pTR4lacZ (–655/+52) transgenic animals (founders 3, 6, and 184). At the gross level, staining of the whole eyes revealed a punctate pattern (Fig.3 A). In sections of these eyes examined by light microscopy, the blue X-gal product was seen to be restricted in its distribution to the RPE cells of transgenic mice (Fig. 3 C), whereas none was present in nontransgenic littermates (Fig. 3, B and D). No staining of lens, anterior segment, or neural retina was observed in transgenic and nontransgenic animals (data not shown). Staining of the RPE was patchy, however, and this was best appreciated by en face light microscopy of transgenic RPE/choroid/sclera flat mount (Fig.3 E). Again, no staining was present in nontransgenic littermate controls (Fig. 3 F). Although most, if not all, cells of the RPE demonstrated some level of X-gal staining in the cytoplasm, about 15% of cells were much more highly stained and filled with blue product. Analyses of fixed TR4 noneye tissues stained with X-gal did not reveal any detectable staining except for the founder 6 progeny, which showed an ectopic β-gal expression in the cerebellum. RPE65 is not expressed in brain (11Hamel C.P. Tsilou E. Harris E. Pfeffer B.A. Hooks J.J. Detrick B. Redmond T.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 34: 414-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) or cerebellum. 3T. M. Redmond, unpublished data. To better understand the transcriptional regulation of theRpe65 gene, we searched for a cellular model capable of activation of the mouse Rpe65 promoter. Although only traces of RPE65 mRNA are detected by PCR in nonconfluent cultures of the human RPE cell D407 (data not shown), it has been demonstrated that these cells are able to activate a human RPE65 promoter (22Nicoletti A. Kawase K. Thompson D.A. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1998; 39: 637-644PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, to test its activity and specificity in vitro, the promoter fragment TR4 (–655 to + 52) was cloned into the luciferase reporter vector pGL3-Basic and transfected into D407 cells. To show the cellular specificity of the vector, it was also transfected into the non-RPE cell lines HeLa, HepG2, and HS27. None of these latter cell lines or the tissues from which the"

The interactions between cationic liposomes of diC14-amidine (see Fig. 1) and a plasmid DNA, as well as the structural modifications involved in the complex formation, were investigated here at different DNA:lipid molar ratios (ρ). This complex has been used successfully to transfect cells in vitro (10Ruysschaert J.M. El Ouahabi A. Willeaume V. Huez G. Fuks R. Vandenbranden M. Di Stefano P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 1622-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC)1 was used to characterize the interactions involved in the complex formation. Fluorescence spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) provided detailed information about the rearrangement of the two components during the complex formation.We propose a kinetic model to analyze the ITC profile in terms of DNA and cationic liposome interactions.RESULTSThe overall interaction process between plasmid DNA and cationic diC14-amidine liposomes was investigated using high sensitivity isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) (26Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2413) Google Scholar).Plasmid DNA was injected into the cell containing unilamellar cationic liposomes of diC14-amidine (Fig.1). The lipid concentration was always kept well above the critical micellar concentration (CMC = 3.9 × 10−7m) during the whole titration, making the contribution of free lipid negligible.At high lipid concentration (above 10 mm), a fast exothermic process (Fig. 2 A, triangles) and a concomitant endothermic one (Fig. 2 A, circles) were observed after DNA addition. The fast exothermic process (equilibrium was reached within 1 min) reflects the electrostatic binding of the plasmid DNA to the positive liposome surface as observed in most binding processes between charged molecules (27Seelig J. Nebel S. Ganz P. Bruns C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9714-9721Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 28Seelig J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1331: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The accompanying endothermic process is about six times slower (seeinset in Fig. 2 A) than the exothermic one and suggests a rearrangement of the two components. The curve in Fig. 2 A clearly shows that this endothermic process is cooperative as reflected by the exponential increase of the signal. In a noncooperative binding mechanism, the enthalpy peak would be constant (28Seelig J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1331: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 29Thomas P.G. Seelig J.

No heat effect was observed above ρ ≅ 0.6 (Fig. 2,A and B). At this ratio, DNA complexation is maximal. At higher DNA:lipid ratios, free DNA was indeed detected in the supernatant of centrifuged complexes (data not shown). Although formation of DNA-lipid complex is, classically, a one-step process, transfection experiments demonstrated that the transfection efficiency associated to the complex was not significantly different when it was formed, as in the ITC experiment, by a stepwise addition (data not shown).The ITC data provided, however, little insight about the endothermic reaction that involves probably major internal reorganization of the DNA/lipid complex. It has been reported that divalent cations such as Ca2+ (30Papahadjopoulos D. Vail W.J. Jacobson K. Poste G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 394: 483-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar) and polycationic amino acids (31Epand R.M. Lim W. Biosci. Rep. 1995; 15: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) induce the fusion of anionic liposomes. The mechanism whereby these cations can induce fusion arise primarily from neutralization of the surface charge of the anionic lipids. Similarly, multivalent anions such as oligonucleotides or DNA can trigger the fusion of cationic liposomes (20Gershon H. Ghirlando R. Guttman S.B. Minsky A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7143-7151Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 32Düzgünes N. Goldstein J.A. Friend D.S. Felgner P.L.

The endothermic reaction here observed could therefore be assigned to a DNA-induced lipid fusion.A fluorescent lipid (pyrene-DPPC) was inserted into the cationic liposomes to detect a possible lipid mixing at different DNA:cationic lipid molar ratios (34Nieva J.L. Bron R. Cover J. Wilschut J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2797-2804Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Insertion of pyrene-DPPC did not affect significantly their transfection efficiency (data not shown). As illustrated in Fig. 3 A,DNA caused a substantial decrease of the excimer fluorescence within 10 s after DNA injection, reflecting a rapid and accelerating fusion (Fig. 3 B). Flocculation was observed above a 0.6 molar ratio (ρ ≥ 0.6). A similar phenomenon has been reported previously (35Hirsch-Lerner D. Barenholz Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1370: 17-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 36Kenneth W.C.M. Cullis P.R. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 2534-2545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 37Pires P.

DNA induces fusion of cationic liposomes and leads to larger structures with increasing ρ. The final DNA:lipid ratio at which cationic liposome fusion was observed, did not depend on the addition protocol (stepwise addition or one single addition) (data not shown).Figure 3DNA-induced lipid mixing of cationic lipids using pyrene PC.

Wilschut J. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 220: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) revealed a gel-liquid transition at 23.0 ± 0.1 °C and an enthalpy of 7548 ± 293 kcal/mol of lipid for diC14-amidine cationic liposomes in 10 mm Hepes. At low DNA:lipid molar ratio (e.g.ρ = 0.03; ρ = 0.21), neither the transition temperature nor the enthalpy were affected (Fig. 4,A and B). At higher DNA:lipid molar ratios, DNA destabilizes the liposomal bilayer in a way reminiscent of that described for cholesterol: no significant shift of the transition temperature and a concomitant decrease of the enthalpy. Destabilization was completed at a 1.0 molar ratio (Fig. 4 B), suggesting that the lipid structure has a new organization.Figure 4Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) of the DNA/lipid complex at different molar ratios.

A single plasmid DNA (5.4 kbp) binds several positively charged diC14-amidine liposomes (60-nm diameter, as determined by laser light scattering) (data not shown). This process is rapid and exothermic as verified by isothermal titration calorimetry at high total lipid concentration. It is assumed that the complex dissociates with a k2 rate constant.Step 2Charge neutralization abolishes repulsion between cationic liposomes (32Düzgünes N. Goldstein J.A. Friend D.S. Felgner P.L. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9179-9184Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In addition, the bilayer organization is strongly destabilized (as illustrated in FITC-dextran release analysis (Fig. 5) and in DSC profiles (Fig. 4)) and undergoes a slow entropy-driven endothermic fusion process. Maximal fusion is reached at ρ > 0.6.These two steps can be described by the following set of differential equations:d[D]dt=d[L]dt=k2[C]−k1[D][L](Eq. 2) d[C]dt=k1[D][L]−(k2+k3)[C](Eq. 3) d[F]dt=k3[C](Eq. 4) with [D], [L], [C], and [F] as molar concentrations of D, L,C, F, and k1,k2, and k3 the corresponding phenomenological (macroscopic) rate constants.k1 described a second order process;k2 and k3, a first order mechanism.Numerical solutions of the concentration profilesD(t), L(t),C(t), and F(t) were calculated for a set of different values of rate constants, applying the Runge Kutta method for differential equations. Using the initial concentrations and time scale described in Fig. 2, A andB, a realistic set of estimated rate constants was derived:k1 = 35,000 s−1 · M−1, k2 = 8.5 10−3s−1, and k3 = 1.7 10−1s−1. Fig. 6 (A andB) illustrates the concentration changes of reactant (D) and products (C and F), resulting from the first DNA injection in the ITC cell: high concentration (Fig. 6 A): [D]start = 7.7 × 10−7m (nucleotide) and [L]start = 3.8 × 10−6m (lipid); low concentration (Fig. 6 B): [D]start = 1.5 × 10−7m (nucleotide) and [L]start = 7.7 × 10−7m (lipid).Figure 6Simulated concentration changes at high (A) and low (B) reactant levelsversus time (DNA = D; complex = C; fused complex =F), resulting from the first DNA injection into diC14-amidine liposome suspension. Concentrations were calculated using the set of equations described under “Discussion.” The concentration changes of reactant and products are representative of those resulting from the first injection of DNA into the ITC cell containing the diC14-amidine liposomes. The lipid curve was not represented here, because lipids were in large excess in comparison with the other concentrations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The L concentration is much higher than that of Dand products C and F and was thus considered as constant and not represented. At low lipid concentration, formation of the complex C is the limiting factor (k1 is rate-limiting). As soon as it is formed,C is further converted into larger fused particles (F); both processes occur at almost the same rate (Fig.6 B). C does not accumulate. This explains why only the endothermic contribution was detectable on the calorimetric pattern (Fig. 2 B). At high lipid concentration (Fig.6 A), the reaction proceeds similarly but faster due to high concentration, but interestingly, C accumulates during the first minute of the process. It is precisely within this period of time that the fast exothermic process was observed experimentally (Fig.2 A) in the ITC pattern. In this situation, thek3 is rate-limiting.To summarize, this model allows to analyze the structural changes observed around a critical DNA:lipid ratio in terms of interactions and complex formation. The kinetic model does not take into account the transformation of the fused complex into larger structures (flocculation). The main reason is that above a 0.6 ratio, no heat changes were detectable in the titration calorimetry profile. DSC (Fig.4) and dextran-FITC release experiments (Fig. 5) demonstrated, however, a complete destabilization of the lipid bilayer above the 0.6 ratio. Close to a 0.6 DNA:lipid molar ratio, further addition of DNA fully destabilizes the lattice due to compensation of the lipid-positive charges. As suggested by Düzgünes et al. (32Düzgünes N. Goldstein J.A. Friend D.S. Felgner P.L. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9179-9184Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) to explain polyanion-induced fusion of dioleyloxypropyltrimethylammonium (DOTMA) liposomes, water molecules are expelled from the liposomal surface during the complex formation, making it more hydrophobic. Consecutively, the intervesicular electrostatic repulsions are reduced, leading to a collapse of the complex into larger macroscopic aggregates (37Pires P. Simoes S. Nir S. Gaspar R. Düzgünes N. Pedroso de Lima M.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1418: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 39Huebner S. Battersby B.J. Grimm R. Cevc G. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 3158-3166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Those large particles start to sediment, as reflected by the white flocculating aspect of the solution.Those results could corroborate the “rod-shaped” structural model (25Sternberg B. Hong K. Zheng W. Papahadjopoulos D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1375: 23-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) with a breakup of the liposomes and the coating of the DNA by cylindrical bilayers. However, they are not in agreement with either the Gershon model (20Gershon H. Ghirlando R. Guttman S.B. Minsky A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7143-7151Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar) or the “sandwich-like” model (22Sternberg B. Sorgi F.L. Huang L. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 361-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar), both of which support persistence of liposomal structures after complex formation.To relate different biophysical characterization of DNA/diC14-amidine complexes with their transfection properties, we have compared the transfection efficiency on CHO cells at various DNA:lipid molar ratios. The resulting profile (Fig.7) shows clearly that transfection increases strongly near the critical 0.6 molar DNA:lipid ratio, is maximal around 0.8, and then decreases at 1.0. This profile is reminiscent of the modification of the biophysical parameters at various DNA:lipid ratios. There is an obvious parallel between the results of our biophysical experiments and the transfection properties of the DNA/diC14-amidine complexes, showing that maximal transfection activity occurs in a range where liposome destabilization through DNA is close to maximal.Figure 7Transfection efficiency of CHO cells as a function of DNA:lipid molar ratio.

We investigated the functional roles of the two domains of phosducin and phosducin-like protein in binding retinal Gtβγ. Kinetic measurements using surface plasmon resonance showed that: 1) phosducin bound Gtβγ with a 2.5-fold greater affinity than phosducin-like protein; 2) phosphorylation of phosducin decreased its affinity by 3-fold, principally as a result of a decrease in k1; and 3) most of the free energy of binding comes from the N-terminal domain with a lesser contribution from the C-terminal domain. In assays measuring the association of Gtβγ with Gtα and light-activated rhodopsin, both N-terminal domains inhibited binding while neither of the C-terminal domains had any effect.

Signals from hormones, neurotransmitters, odorants, and photons use G protein-dependent pathways. These pathways are designed to amplify and integrate a multiplicity of both stimulatory and inhibitory responses. The cellular response is initiated by an agonist-dependent conformational change in the receptor. This starts a cascade of events in which GTP is exchanged for GDP on the α subunit of the heterotrimer G protein (G), and the G protein dissociates into Gα·GTP and Gβγ subunits. Both Gα·GTP and Gβγ then activate effector enzymes or ion channels. These effectors in turn control kinase cascades and second messenger concentrations (cyclic nucleotides, inositol phosphates, lipids, and Ca2+) that dictate the cellular response (for recent reviews, see Refs. 1Neer E.J.

Pd binds the photoreceptor-specific isoform of Gβγ (Gtβ1γ1) with high affinity and blocks Gtβγ association with both Gtα and rod outer-segment disc membranes (17Yoshida T. Willardson B.M. Wilkins J.F. Jensen G.J. Thornton B.D. Bitensky M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24050-24057Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When Pd is phosphorylated at Ser-73 by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) (18Lee R.H. Brown B.M. Lolley R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15860-15866Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it no longer blocks association with Gtα (17Yoshida T. Willardson B.M. Wilkins J.F. Jensen G.J. Thornton B.D. Bitensky M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24050-24057Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The phosphorylation state of Pd is determined by light, being phosphorylated in the dark and dephosphorylated upon illumination (19Lee R.H. Brown B.M. Lolley R.N. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1972-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). These data have lead to the hypothesis that Pd participates in light adaptation in the following way (20Willardson B.M. Wilkins J.F. Yoshida T. Bitensky M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1475-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In the light, Pd becomes dephosphorylated and binds Gtβγ. This blocks reassociation of Gtβγ with Gtα·GDP, thereby inhibiting further activation of heterotrimeric Gtby light-activated rhodopsin (Rho*). The function of PhLP is less well understood. PhLP is widely expressed at much higher levels than Pd in tissues other than the retina and pineal (12Miles M.F. Barhite S. Sganga M. Elliott M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10831-10835Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). It also binds Gβγ with high affinity (21Schröder S. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2100-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 22Thibault C. Sganga M.W. Miles M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12253-12256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Thus, PhLP may represent a homologue of Pd that regulates a number of G protein pathways in many cell types. Regulation of PhLP activity differs from that of Pd in that PhLP is not a good substrate for PKA, and thus its ability to bind Gtβγ is not affected by PKA phosphorylation (23Thulin C.D. Howes K. Driscoll C.D. Savage J.R. Rand T.A. Baehr W. Willardson B.M. Mol. Vision. 1999; 5: 40PubMed Google Scholar). Both Pd and PhLP are composed of two independent domains. The crystal structure of Pd complexed with Gtβγ (24Gaudet R. Bohm A. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1996; 87: 577-588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) shows that the two domains of Pd wrap around Gtβγ forming an extensive interface. Pd buries ∼2300 Å2 of solvent-accessible surface area upon binding. The N-terminal domain (Pd-N) accounts for ∼1500 Å2 and the C-terminal domain (Pd-C) for ∼800 Å2. Pd-N, which is mostly helical, interacts extensively with the loops on the top of the Gtβ propeller, the same face of Gtβγ that interacts with Gtα and other Gβγ-dependent effectors (25Ford C.E. Skiba N.P. Bae H. Daaka Y. Reuveny E. Shekter L.R. Rosal R. Weng G. Yang C.-S. Iyengar R. Miller R.J. Jan L.Y. Lefkowitz R.J. Hamm H.E. Science. 1998; 280: 1271-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Pd-C shows structural homology to thioredoxin and binds the outer strands of the Gtβ-propeller blades 1 and 7 (numbered as in Ref. 26Sondek J. Bohm A. Lambright D.G. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar) at the putative membrane-binding site of Gtβγ and has been proposed to sterically block binding of Gtβγ to the membrane (24Gaudet R. Bohm A. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1996; 87: 577-588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the complex also showed a local change in the conformation of Gtβγ in three loops (287–295, 308–318, and 329–338) compared with the structure of free or Gtα-bound Gtβγ (24Gaudet R. Bohm A. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1996; 87: 577-588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). These loops interact with residues in the far N-terminal loop, helix 3, and the C-terminal domain of Pd. It has been postulated that the pocket created by this conformational change harbors the C-terminal farnesyl group of Gγ that helps anchor free Gtβγ in the membrane (27Loew A. Ho Y.-K. Blundell T. Bax B. Structure. 1998; 6: 1007-1019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Burying the hydrophobic farnesyl moiety in this manner may contribute to the dissociation of Gtβγ from the membrane that occurs upon Pd binding (11Lee R.H. Lieberman B.S. Lolley R.N. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 3983-3990Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 17Yoshida T. Willardson B.M. Wilkins J.F. Jensen G.J. Thornton B.D. Bitensky M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24050-24057Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that Pd-N accounts for ∼65% of the contact surface is consistent with previous reports showing that the Gβγ binding domain is localized to this domain (28Hawes B.E. Touhara K. Kurose H. Lefkowitz R.J. Inglese J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29825-29830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Xu J. Wu D. Slepak V. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Int. 1997; 31: 625-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). These studies have also shown that a stretch of 11 residues in Pd-N, perfectly conserved between Pd and PhLP, is essential for Gβγ binding and translocation from the membrane. These conserved residues form helix 1 of Pd, of which 7 of the 11 residues make contacts with Gβγ (24Gaudet R. Bohm A. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1996; 87: 577-588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). In contrast, other work has reported that a small fragment from Pd-C (residues 215–232) is sufficient for disrupting Gβγ interactions with Goα and effectors (32Bluml K. Schnepp W. Schröder S. Beyermann M. Macias M. Oschkinat H. Lohse M.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4908-4915Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Moreover, a short form of PhLP (residues 84–301; Ref. 12Miles M.F. Barhite S. Sganga M. Elliott M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10831-10835Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), which lacks helix 1 (residues 57–67 of PhLP), was reported to block Gβγ functions (21Schröder S. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2100-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Furthermore, studies measuring binding of truncated PhLP fusion proteins to Gβγ have demonstrated independent binding of Gβγ to both the N- and C-terminal halves of PhLP (22Thibault C. Sganga M.W. Miles M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12253-12256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Because of this uncertainty concerning the relative functions of the N- and C-terminal domains in blocking membrane and Gtα binding of Gtβγ, we have systematically analyzed the roles of the two domains of Pd and PhLP using functional assays of receptor and membrane binding. In addition, we have measured the kinetics of binding of the two domains using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) techniques. We also examine the effect of the Gtβγ conformational change that occurs upon Pd binding on membrane association and estimate the free energy of the conformational change. From the data, we propose a model for the function of the two domains in the inhibition of Gtα binding to Gtβγ and the dissociation of Gtβγ from the membrane. The pET 15b vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) containing the recombinant rat Pd cDNA with a His6 tag as well as the pET 11a vectors containing the amino-terminal (Pd-N, residues 12–107) and carboxyl-terminal (Pd-C, residues 108–246) domains of rat Pd (33Gaudet R.

Gaudet (Harvard University). The gene encoding PhLP was cloned by reverse transcription/PCR from rat kidney total mRNA using RNasin/avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI), followed by PCR amplification using the forward primer 5′-cgcggcagccatatgacaaccctggatgac-3′, containing an NdeI restriction site, and the reverse primer 5′-agccggatccttatcaatctatttctagatcgc-3′, containing a BamHI restriction site and Taq DNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cDNA was then subcloned into the pET 15b vector using NdeI and BamHI, and transformed into BL-21(DE3) cells (Life Technologies, Inc.) for protein expression. The N-terminal domain of rat PhLP (PhLP-N, residues 1–153) was constructed by PCR using the above construct as template, with the forward primer 5′-cgcggcagccatatgacaaccctggatgac-3′, containing an NdeI restriction site, and the reverse primer 5′-agccggatccttaatgaagctgctgccgcatc-3′, containing a BamHI restriction site and Taq DNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.). The amplicon was subcloned into the pET 15b vector using NdeI and BamHI, and transformed into BL-21(DE3) cells for protein expression. The C-terminal domain of rat PhLP (PhLP-C, residues 153–301) was constructed by PCR using the full-length construct as template, with the forward primer 5′-cgcggcagccatatgcataaagggccccaattc-3′, containing an NdeI restriction site, the reverse primer 5′-agccggatccttatcaatctatttctagatcgc-3′, containing a BamHI restriction site and Taq DNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.). The amplicon was subcloned into the pET 15b vector using NdeI and BamHI, and transformed into BL-21(DE3) cells for protein expression. All constructs were sequenced to verify the correct nucleotide composition. Preparation of bovine urea-stripped rod outer segment (UROS) membranes, Gtα, and Gtβγ, as well as125I-labeling of the G protein subunits, was performed as described previously (17Yoshida T.

His6-tagged Pd, Pd-N, Pd-C, PhLP, PhLP-N, and PhLP-C were expressed in Escherichia coliand purified on a nickel-chelate column. A single E. colicolony was grown in 1 liter of Luria-Bertani media with 50 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C until the optical density was between 0.8 and 1.0 (∼20 h). Expression was induced by adding 500 μmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and incubating for another 3 h at 37 °C. Cells were pelleted by centrifuging at 4,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of B-PER cell lysis reagent (Pierce) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cell suspension in B-PER was sonicated on ice with three 20-s pulses from a tip sonicator with 2-min pauses between pulses to avoid overheating the sample. The sonicated samples were centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was removed and loaded on a Probond nickel chelate column (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) with an ∼10-ml bed volume equilibrated in Equilibration buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 50 mmimidazole). The column was washed with Equilibration buffer until the non-bound proteins had eluted. The His6-tagged Pd was eluted with Equilibration buffer at pH 7.0 containing 300 mm imidazole. The Pd was concentrated and buffer-exchanged by ultrafiltration into isotonic buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for binding assays. The Pd and PhLP species purified in this manner were >95% pure as determined by Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE gels. The binding kinetics of Pd, PhLP, and their N- and C-terminal domains were measured by optical detection of SPR (34Jonsson U. Fagerstam L. Ivarsson B. Johnsson B. Karlsson R. Lundh K. Lofas S.

Methods Enzymol. 1998; 295: 268-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) using a BIACORE 2000 instrument (BIACORE AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Each His6-tagged full-length protein or individual domain was immobilized on a single flow cell surface of a Ni2+-NTA chip. Molar equivalent amounts of protein were immobilized, ranging from 150 response units (RU) for the 36-kDa full-length PhLP to 50 RU for the 12 kDa Pd-N. To measure the binding kinetics, purified Gtβγ in Eluent buffer (10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05 mm EDTA, 0.005% surfactant P20, pH 7.4) at five known concentrations (∼5-fold above and below the Kd) was injected at 20 μl/min over the test flow cell surface containing the immobilized Pd and over a control flow cell surface without immobilized protein. The 5-min binding phase was followed by a similar 5-min dissociation phase in which Eluent buffer without Gtβγ was passed over both surfaces. The response from the control flow cell was subtracted from the test flow cell using the BIACORE BIAevaluation software to remove components of the response resulting from nonspecific binding of Gtβγ to the Ni2+-NTA surface or from differences in refractive index between the Gtβγ-containing Eluent buffer and Eluent buffer alone. Nonspecific binding was minimal at nanomolar concentrations of Gtβγ, but became more significant at micromolar concentrations. By 10 μm Gtβγ, nonspecific binding accounted for ∼50% of the response and thus, binding affinities higher than 10 μm could not be analyzed accurately. Between each run, both flow cells were regenerated with 20 μl of Eluent buffer containing 350 mm EDTA and then recharged with 20 μl of 500 μm NiCl2in Eluent buffer. A set of curves was generated for each Pd species from the background-subtracted curves at each of the five Gtβγ concentrations tested. This set of five curves was simultaneously fit to a simple one-to-one bimolecular binding model with base-line drift by a global analysis using the BIAevaluation software. From the global fit, the association and dissociation rate constants (k1 and k−1, respectively), and the equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) were obtained. Chi-square values of the fits ranged from 0.62 to 4.6. The data were also fit to a model that requires a conformational change in Gtβγ for binding to occur (see Fig. 4) using the Clamp SPR analysis software (35Morton T.A. Myszka D.G. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 295: 268-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). There was no difference in the fit of the two models because the rates of the conformational change were much faster than the rates of Pd binding to Gtβγ. The Kd values were also measured from the steady state RU values and were very similar to the Kd values obtained from the k−1/k1 ratio. Base-line drift is commonly encountered with Ni2+-NTA surfaces resulting from loss of the His6-tagged protein during the run. This drift did not exceed ∼2 RU lost/min. For phosphorylated Pd, 10 μm Pd was phosphorylated with 0.5 unit/μl of purified PKA catalytic subunit (Fluka, Ronkonkoma, NY) in 50 μl of phosphorylation buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2.0 mm MgCl2, 1.0 mm ATP, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μm EDTA) for 10 min at 23 °C prior to immobilization. This results in quantitative phosphorylation of Pd at serine 73 (17–18). The phosphorylated Pd was diluted to 50 nm in Eluent buffer and immobilized on the Ni2+-NTA surface. With recombinant Pd purified from E. coli, the phosphorylated form is very stable (33Gaudet R. Savage J.R. McLaughlin J.N. Willardson B.M. Sigler P.B. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 649-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Thus, the phosphorylation state was maintained after immobilization during the ∼15-min course of a Gtβγ injection. Binding of125I-Gtα to light-activated rhodopsin (Rho*) in the presence of Gtβγ was measured as described previously (17Yoshida T. Willardson B.M. Wilkins J.F. Jensen G.J. Thornton B.D. Bitensky M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24050-24057Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, 0.2 μm125I-Gtα and 0.2 μmGtβγ were incubated with UROS membranes at 1.0 μm rhodopsin in the dark with increasing concentrations of Pd, PhLP, or their N- and C-terminal domains. Light-induced binding was initiated by illuminating for 1 min, producing a 50% bleach of the rhodopsin. In the absence of guanine nucleotides, the Rho*Gt formed upon bleaching is stable for several hours (36Bornancin F. Pfister C. Chabre M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 184: 687-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Samples were centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 20 min, and the amount of 125I-Gtα in the pellet was quantified. Nonspecific binding was determined in samples without Gtβγ and was subtracted from all samples. The light-induced binding data were plotted and fit by non-linear least squares regression using the Kaleidagraph graphics program (Synergy Software, Reading, PA) to the following inhibition equation: % bound = 100%/(1 + ([Pd]/IC50) n ), where IC50 is the half-maximal inhibition and n is the Hill coefficient. Binding of 125I-Gtβγ (0.36 μm) to unilluminated UROS membranes (10 μmRho) was measured at the indicated Pd, PhLP, and their N- and C-terminal domain concentrations as described previously (17Yoshida T. Willardson B.M. Wilkins J.F. Jensen G.J. Thornton B.D. Bitensky M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24050-24057Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The data were plotted and fit using Kaleidagraph to equations derived from two different models of Pd inhibition of membrane binding. The full-length proteins and C-terminal domains were fit to Model 1 (Fig. 4). From the expressions for the equilibrium constants in this model, the expressions for the conservation of mass, and the expression for the conservation of energy (i.e. Kd(3) Kc(1) =Kd(2) Kc(2)), an expression for membrane-bound Gtβγ was obtained in the form of a quadratic equation. A=[M⋅Gtβγ]2+B[M⋅Gtβγ]+C=0Equation 1 A=−1;B=[M]t+[Gtβγ]t+Kd(1)+Kd(1)Kc(1)+Kd(1)[Pd]/Kd(3)+Kc(1)[Pd]/Kd(2);C=−[Gtβγ]t[M]tThe [Gtβγ] t was 0.36 μm. The [M] t and Kd(2) were found to be 2.2 μm (at 10 μm Rho) and 4.7 μm, respectively, by separate assays measuring 125I-Gtβγ binding to unilluminated UROS membranes in the absence of Pd (data not shown). The membrane binding sites are likely to be made of lipid because they are insensitive to heat denaturation at 80 °C (17Yoshida T. Willardson B.M. Wilkins J.F. Jensen G.J. Thornton B.D. Bitensky M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24050-24057Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The number of sites is probably limited by the membrane packing density of Gtβγ. This has been reported to maximize at a ratio of 1 Gt heterotrimer to every 4–5 Rho (37Liebman P.A. Sitaramayya A. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Protein Phosphorylat. Res. 1984; 17: 215-225PubMed Google Scholar), which is consistent with the 2.2 μm binding sites at 10 μm Rho found here. The free [Pd] was taken to be equal to the total [Pd] added. This approximation introduced a less than 10% error in the Kc values determined from fits of the full-length Pd and PhLP inhibition curves to the model and a less than 1% error in the Kc values from fits of the inhibition curves of the domains. Only the positive root of the quadratic equation gave meaningful results. From the fit of the data to Equation 1, Kc(1) and Kd(3) values were determined. The N-terminal domain inhibition data were fit to Model 2 (Fig. 4). A quadratic expression for the membrane-bound Gtβγ was obtained as described for Model 1, except that there were two membrane-bound species in Model 2, Gtβγ·M and Pd-N·Gtβγ·M. The quadratic terms for [Gtβγ·M] were as follows. A=−(Kd(3)+2[Pd−N]+[Pd−N]2/Kd(3));Equation 2 B=Kd(3)[M]t+Kd(3)[Gtβγ]t+[Pd−N][M]t+[Pd−N][Gtβγ]t+Kd(1)Kd(3)+Kd(1)Kc(1)Kd(3)+Kd(1)[Pd−N]+Kd(1)Kc(1)Kd(3)[Pd−N]/Kd(2);C=−Kd(3)[Gtβγ]t[M]tThe quadratic terms for [Pd-N·Gtβγ·M] were as follows. A=−([Pd­N]+2Kd(3)+Kd(3)2/[Pd­N]);Equation 3 B=Kd(3)[M]t+Kd(3)[Gtβγ]t+[Pd−N][M]t+[Pd−N][Gtβγ]t+Kd(1)Kd(3)+Kd(1)Kc(1)Kd(3)+Kd(1)[Pd−N]+Kd(1)Kc(1)Kd(3)[Pd−N]/Kd(2);+Kd(1)Kd(3)+Kd(1)Kc(1)Kd(3)+Kd(1)[Pd­N]+Kd(1)Kc(1)Kd(3)[Pd­N]/Kd(2);C=−[Pd−N][Gtβγ]t[M]tThe total membrane-bound Gtβγ was calculated as the sum of Equations 2 and 3. In the case in which Kd(2) ≪Kd(3), Models 1 and 2 reduce to Model 3. The quadratic terms for the equation describing this model were as follows. A=−1;Equation 4 B=[M]t+[Gtβγ]t+Kd(1)+Kd(1)Kc(1)+Kd(1)Kc(1)[Pd]/Kd(2);C=−[Gtβγ]t[M]t In order to quantify the binding of Pd domains to Gtβγ, their interactions were measured by SPR techniques (34Jonsson U. Fagerstam L. Ivarsson B. Johnsson B. Karlsson R. Lundh K. Lofas S. Persson B. Roos H. Ronnberg I. Sjolander R. Stenberg E. Stahlberg R. Urbaniczky C. Ostlin H. Malmqvist M. BioTechniques. 1991; 11: 620-627PubMed Google Scholar) using a BIACORE 2000 instrument. Pd domains were immobilized on a Ni2+-NTA chip, and Gtβγ was applied to the binding surface. The kinetics of both association and dissociation events were measured at five different Gtβγ concentrations above and below the Kd for each Pd and PhLP species. From these data, families of curves were generated and fit by global analysis using the BIAevaluation software (BIACORE). Global analysis simultaneously fits k1, k−1, and the surface binding capacity at each Gtβγ concentration. An example of the fitted data for full-length Pd is shown in Fig.1 A. Two to four similar data sets were collected for each full-length protein or N-terminal domain as well as for phosphorylated Pd using two or three different Gtβγ preparations. There was good agreement between data sets. The binding parameters resulting from this analysis are summarized in Table I.Kd values were determined from the k−1/k1 ratio as well as from the steady-state binding levels reached during the association phase (Fig. 1 B). Both determinations gave similar Kd values. The k1 and k−1 values for full-length Pd were 1.1 × 105m−1s−1 and 4.6 × 10−3 s−1, respectively, with a corresponding Kd of 42 ± 6 nm (n = 3). From steady-state measurements, the Kd was 47 ± 0.3 (n = 3).

This leads to a rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis and severe pulmonary hemorrhage. Previous studies have indicated a limited epitope for the toxic antibodies in the N-terminal part of the non-collagenous domain. The epitope has been partially characterized by recreating the epitope in the non-reactive α1-chain by exchanging nine residues to the corresponding ones of α3. In this study we have investigated to what extent each of these amino acids contribute to the antibody binding in different patient sera. The results show that seven of the nine substitutions are enough to get an epitope that is recognized equally well as the native α3-chain by all sera from 20 clinically verified Goodpasture patients. Furthermore, the patient sera reactivity against the different recombinant chains used in the study are very similar, with some minor exceptions, strongly supporting a highly defined and restricted epitope. We are convinced that the restriction of the epitope is of significant importance for the understanding of the etiology of the disease.

The disease is B cell and antibody mediated, with autoantibodies directed against proteins in the glomerular basement membrane and lung alveoli. When bound to self-structures in the kidney and lung, the antibodies initiate an inflammatory destruction of tissue by recruitment of complement leading to rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis often accompanied with severe and life threatening lung hemorrhage. The major self-epitope is located on the α3-NC1 domain of collagen IV. Collagen IV α3-chain has a limited distribution in the body and is only found in a few specialized basement membranes including the glomerular and alveolar basement membranes, thus explaining the specific organ involvement in Goodpasture disease. Goodpasture disease is indeed an antibody mediated disease as proven by the transfer of disease to monkeys by injection of kidney bound antibodies from Goodpasture patients (1Lerner R.A. Glassock R.J. Dixon F.J. J. Exp. Med. 1967; 126: 989-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar) and the therapeutic effect of treating patients with plasma exchange and immunosuppressive drugs to reduce the amount of circulating antibodies (2Turner N. Lockwood C.M. Rees A.J. Schrier R.W. Gottschalk C.W. Diseases of the Kidney. Little Brown and Co., Boston1993: 1865-1894Google Scholar). The Goodpasture epitope is a conformational epitope, which is indicated by the loss of reactivity to autoantibodies when the tertiary protein structure is disrupted by reduction of disulfide bonds (3Wieslander J. Bygren P. Heinegard D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1544-1548Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The epitope is also known as a cryptotope, i.e. the epitope is hidden in the native protein structure and is fully exposed first when the protein is partially denatured (4Wieslander J. Langeveld J. Butkowski R. Jodlowski M. Noelken M. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8564-8570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Trying to map an epitope for a specific autoimmune disorder is very difficult, since in most cases autoantibodies against a variety of epitopes on the target structure are formed. For Goodpasture syndrome a limited epitope distribution was indicated when binding of autoantibodies to collagen IV was successfully blocked by one single monoclonal antibody (5Pusey C.D. Dash A. Kershaw M.J. Morgan A. Reilly A. Rees A.J. Lockwood C.M. Lab. Invest. 1987; 56: 23-31PubMed Google Scholar, 6Hellmark T. Johansson C. Wieslander J. Kidney Int. 1994; 46: 823-829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In our first attempt to map the Goodpasture epitope we used linear synthetic peptides of the α3(IV) NC1 domain to block the binding of autoantibodies to collagen IV (7Hellmark T. Brunmark C. Trojnar J. Wieslander J. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1996; 105: 504-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). With this method we were unable to map any epitope on the α3(IV) NC1 domain although for one patient an epitope on the α1(IV) NC1 domain was found. In a study by Kalluri et al. (8Kalluri R. Gunwar S. Reeders S.T. Morrison K.C. Mariyama M. Ebner K.E. Noelken M.E. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24018-24024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using linear peptides, they suggested the C-terminal part of the α3 (IV) NC1 domain to comprise the Goodpasture epitope. However this study as well as ours suffered from the disadvantage of using linear peptides to characterize a conformational epitope and the results have not been confirmed.To avoid the problem with linear peptides and mal-folded recombinants expressed in bacterial systems, new mapping strategies has been initiated by several groups, where recombinant collagen IV is expressed in eukaryotic cell lines. By substitution of amino acid residues in the α3(IV) NC1 against the corresponding ones from the homologous but non-reactive α1(IV) chain, and expressing the constructs in an eukaryotic expression system correctly folded proteins with intact conformational epitopes are produced. All these studies have emphasized the N-terminal part of the α3 (IV) NC1 as the principal epitope region (9Quinones S. Bernal D. Garcia-Sogo M. Elena S.F. Saus J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19780-19784Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Kalluri R. Sun M.J. Hudson B.G. Neilson E.G. J. Biol.

Immunol. 1998; 113: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we found that only autoantibodies against the N-terminal third of the α3(IV) NC1 domain are pathologically significant (12Hellmark T. Segelmark M. Unger C. Burkhardt H. Saus J. Wieslander J. Kidney Int. 1999; 55: 936-944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Following studies have revealed a small region within the N-terminal part of the α3 NC1 as the major target for the circulating antibodies. This epitope has then been recreated by substitution of a few a.a. residues in the non-reactive α1-chain to the corresponding ones from α3 (13Netzer K.-O. Leinonen A. Boutaud A. Borza D.B. Todd P.

Chem. 1999; 274: 25862-25868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In our hands, all 20 patients in the cohort recognized this epitope (15Hellmark T. Burkhardt H. Wieslander J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25862-25868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar).The principal goal for this study was to investigate if a reactive epitope could be created in the α1(IV) NC1 with fewer than the nine substitutions, previously reported, and to what extent each of these amino acids contribute to the antibody binding in different patient sera.RESULTSIn a previous study we were able to recreate an immunoreactive epitope in the non-reactive α1(IV) NC1 domain by substitution of single amino acids to the corresponding ones of α3 (15Hellmark T. Burkhardt H. Wieslander J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25862-25868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In that study two principle constructs were made, one with five amino acid substitutions in positions known to be critical for epitope recognition (P5–P9), called the S1 construct, and one with four additional substitutions in non-conserved positions in the same region (P1–P4), called S2. It was shown that the five substitution recombinants only reacted weak with the antibodies, whereas the nine-substitution recombinant showed immunoreactivity to all tested sera. In this present study, we have investigated what impact each of these amino acids has on the affinity of autoantibodies from different patients. Thereby further characterizing the immune response in Goodpasture disease to this major epitope. To achieve this, all possible combinations of the four additional substitutions were made in a total of 14 new recombinants. The S1 construct was used as template, and then subsequent substitutions were introduced with site-directed mutagenesis using the primers listed in Table I.Initial Screening of ReactivityInitial tests of the 14 recombinants' immunoreactivity against all 20 patient sera were performed using ELISA and inhibition ELISA. Of the 14 tested recombinants only five were reactive with the patient sera, one of the seven substitutions (R12) and four of the eight substitutions (R123, R124, R134, and R234). The other recombinants did not show reactivity above the reactivity against the recombinant α1(IV) NC1 (data not shown) and therefore not further evaluated. The reactive recombinants R12, R123, R134, and R234 were carefully analyzed again to establish their reactivity compared with the nine-substitution recombinant (S2), recombinant α3, and recombinant α1. In Fig. 2, the immunoblotting results are shown.ELISAThe recombinants were first analyzed using direct ELISA (Fig. 3). With this assay, we found no significant difference in reactivity for the R12 recombinant compared with the S2 protein. In line with these results, none of the eight substitution recombinants had a significantly lower reactivity than the α3 recombinant. Although it is noticeable that recombinant R134 that lack substitution 2 has a significantly lower reactivity than R12, probably indicating a greater importance for substitution 2. In fact, two of the samples did not react with this R134 recombinant, and another six of them showed low reactivity.Figure 3Mean absorbance in the direct ELISA where the different recombinants were incubated with sera from 20 biopsy-proven Goodpasture patients.

The highest inhibitory effect was found using recombinant α3, S2, or R12, while all the eight substitution recombinants showed a significantly lower inhibitory capacity than the seven-substitution R12 recombinant.

Chem. 1999; 274: 25862-25868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONCirculating autoantibodies against different parts of the α3(IV) chain, as well as antibodies against other α(IV) chains, are detected in serum from patients with Goodpasture disease (6Hellmark T. Johansson C. Wieslander J. Kidney Int. 1994; 46: 823-829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 19Neilson E.G. Kalluri R. Sun M.J. Gunwar S. Danoff T. Mariyama M. Maers J.C. Reeders S.T. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8402-8405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the major epitope region is found to be the N-terminal part of the α3(IV) NC1 (9Quinones S. Bernal D. Garcia-Sogo M. Elena S.F. Saus J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19780-19784Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Ryan J.J. Mason P.J. Pusey C.D. Turner N. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1998; 113: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and only antibodies against this part of the molecule correlate with disease progression (12Hellmark T. Segelmark M. Unger C. Burkhardt H. Saus J. Wieslander J. Kidney Int. 1999; 55: 936-944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 15Hellmark T. Burkhardt H. Wieslander J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25862-25868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In this study we have further narrowed down and characterized the molecular properties of this epitope recognized by the pathogenic autoantibodies. A recombinant protein comprised of the α1(IV) NC1 domain with seven amino acids substituted to the corresponding ones from the α3 chain was constructed. This recombinant protein, R12, was recognized by the autoantibodies from all patients with Goodpasture disease, in both direct ELISA and in inhibition ELISA, to the same degree as recombinant α3. These results support the previous findings where we and others have localized the major epitope to the same region (13Netzer K.-O. Leinonen A. Boutaud A. Borza D.B. Todd P. Gunwar S. Langeveld J.P. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11267-11274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 14Borza D.B. Netzer K.-O. Leinonen A. Todd P. Cervera J. Saus J. Hudson B.G. J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 25862-25868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar).The very limited region recognized by all Goodpasture sera indicates a similar immunization and maturation process in all patients. Interestingly, an overlapping T-cell epitope is found by Phelps and co-workers (20Phelps R.G. Jones V.L. Coughlan M. Turner A.N. Rees A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11440-11447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 21Phelps R.G. Rees A.J. Kidney Int. 1999; 56: 1638-1653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). However, if this process is initiated by a foreign immunogen, i.e. molecular mimicry, or if it is a self-immunization with degraded type IV collagen, is yet unknown.As shown in Fig. 5 a, the epitope is localized to a small loop in the secondary sequence. The epitope seems to be dependent on correct folding of this loop, indicated both by the fact that disruption of the disulfide bridges (4Wieslander J. Langeveld J. Butkowski R. Jodlowski M. Noelken M. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8564-8570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,7Hellmark T. Brunmark C. Trojnar J. Wieslander J. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1996; 105: 504-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) as well as changes of the charge of certain residues disturb the immunoreactivity. This is shown by the substitutions in positions 3 and 4, of which one, but not both, of the resulting amino acids must have a negative charge for the epitope to be fully recognized. In R124 both residues are negatively charged, and in R123 both residues are uncharged, and in both, the changes result in a loss of affinity. The preservation of the positively charged lysine in position P2, seen in the S1 and R134 recombinants (Fig. 5 b), dramatically reduce affinity to the recombinants. Surprisingly, the R12, as well as the S2, R123, and R124, actually reacted stronger than the recombinant α3(IV) in the direct ELISA. This could possibly be explained by a less rigid structure in the α1(IV) background that results in a more accessible epitope. This theory is supported by the fact that this difference in reactivity did not appear when the recombinants were analyzed using inhibition ELISA. An alternative explanation for the higher reactivity could be that the produced recombinant, e.g. R12, displays an epitope more similar to a hypothetical mimicry structure than the native α3(IV) NC1 does.Figure 5a, a model (22Siebold B. Deutzmann R. Kühn K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 176: 617-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) of the R12 NC1 domain from type IV collagen, where each ball represents one amino acid.

The amino acid in the P9 position is common for the α3(IV) NC1 and the recombinants, but differs from the corresponding one of α1(IV) NC1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Although all samples recognize one very limited area on the α3(IV) NC1, there are some differences in recognition pattern between the different samples. As discussed above the effect of charge changes within the loop have different effect on antibodies from different sera (especially the R134). Furthermore the relative amount of antibodies against the epitope defined by the R12 constructs varies from serum to serum, ranging from 65 to 95%.We believe that this study of the Goodpasture epitope adds new and important data that will help us to understand the underlying immunological mechanisms in Goodpasture disease in particular, but also for autoimmune diseases in general. By using the R12 recombinant protein in an assay instead of the complete α3(IV) NC1, a more specific diagnostic test could be developed that could distinguish between pathogenic antibodies and harmless autoantibodies. Goodpasture disease is known and characterized as a classic autoimmune disease. The disease is B cell and antibody mediated, with autoantibodies directed against proteins in the glomerular basement membrane and lung alveoli. When bound to self-structures in the kidney and lung, the antibodies initiate an inflammatory destruction of tissue by recruitment of complement leading to rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis often accompanied with severe and life threatening lung hemorrhage. The major self-epitope is located on the α3-NC1 domain of collagen IV. Collagen IV α3-chain has a limited distribution in the body and is only found in a few specialized basement membranes including the glomerular and alveolar basement membranes, thus explaining the specific organ involvement in Goodpasture disease. Goodpasture disease is indeed an antibody mediated disease as proven by the transfer of disease to monkeys by injection of kidney bound antibodies from Goodpasture patients (1Lerner R.A.

Lockwood C.M. Rees A.J. Schrier R.W. Gottschalk C.W. Diseases of the Kidney. Little Brown and Co., Boston1993: 1865-1894Google Scholar). The Goodpasture epitope is a conformational epitope, which is indicated by the loss of reactivity to autoantibodies when the tertiary protein structure is disrupted by reduction of disulfide bonds (3Wieslander J.

Trying to map an epitope for a specific autoimmune disorder is very difficult, since in most cases autoantibodies against a variety of epitopes on the target structure are formed. For Goodpasture syndrome a limited epitope distribution was indicated when binding of autoantibodies to collagen IV was successfully blocked by one single monoclonal antibody (5Pusey C.D. Dash A.

In our first attempt to map the Goodpasture epitope we used linear synthetic peptides of the α3(IV) NC1 domain to block the binding of autoantibodies to collagen IV (7Hellmark T. Brunmark C.

The principal goal for this study was to investigate if a reactive epitope could be created in the α1(IV) NC1 with fewer than the nine substitutions, previously reported, and to what extent each of these amino acids contribute to the antibody binding in different patient sera. RESULTSIn a previous study we were able to recreate an immunoreactive epitope in the non-reactive α1(IV) NC1 domain by substitution of single amino acids to the corresponding ones of α3 (15Hellmark T. Burkhardt H. Wieslander J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25862-25868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In that study two principle constructs were made, one with five amino acid substitutions in positions known to be critical for epitope recognition (P5–P9), called the S1 construct, and one with four additional substitutions in non-conserved positions in the same region (P1–P4), called S2. It was shown that the five substitution recombinants only reacted weak with the antibodies, whereas the nine-substitution recombinant showed immunoreactivity to all tested sera. In this present study, we have investigated what impact each of these amino acids has on the affinity of autoantibodies from different patients. Thereby further characterizing the immune response in Goodpasture disease to this major epitope.

Of the 14 tested recombinants only five were reactive with the patient sera, one of the seven substitutions (R12) and four of the eight substitutions (R123, R124, R134, and R234). The other recombinants did not show reactivity above the reactivity against the recombinant α1(IV) NC1 (data not shown) and therefore not further evaluated. The reactive recombinants R12, R123, R134, and R234 were carefully analyzed again to establish their reactivity compared with the nine-substitution recombinant (S2), recombinant α3, and recombinant α1. In Fig. 2, the immunoblotting results are shown.ELISAThe recombinants were first analyzed using direct ELISA (Fig. 3). With this assay, we found no significant difference in reactivity for the R12 recombinant compared with the S2 protein. In line with these results, none of the eight substitution recombinants had a significantly lower reactivity than the α3 recombinant. Although it is noticeable that recombinant R134 that lack substitution 2 has a significantly lower reactivity than R12, probably indicating a greater importance for substitution 2. In fact, two of the samples did not react with this R134 recombinant, and another six of them showed low reactivity.Inhibition ELISAIn contrast to the direct ELISA, the inhibition ELISA revealed differences in affinity to the different recombinants. The highest inhibitory effect was found using recombinant α3, S2, or R12, while all the eight substitution recombinants showed a significantly lower inhibitory capacity than the seven-substitution R12 recombinant.

Burkhardt H. Wieslander J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25862-25868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In a previous study we were able to recreate an immunoreactive epitope in the non-reactive α1(IV) NC1 domain by substitution of single amino acids to the corresponding ones of α3 (15Hellmark T. Burkhardt H. Wieslander J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25862-25868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In that study two principle constructs were made, one with five amino acid substitutions in positions known to be critical for epitope recognition (P5–P9), called the S1 construct, and one with four additional substitutions in non-conserved positions in the same region (P1–P4), called S2. It was shown that the five substitution recombinants only reacted weak with the antibodies, whereas the nine-substitution recombinant showed immunoreactivity to all tested sera. In this present study, we have investigated what impact each of these amino acids has on the affinity of autoantibodies from different patients. Thereby further characterizing the immune response in Goodpasture disease to this major epitope. To achieve this, all possible combinations of the four additional substitutions were made in a total of 14 new recombinants. The S1 construct was used as template, and then subsequent substitutions were introduced with site-directed mutagenesis using the primers listed in Table I. Initial Screening of ReactivityInitial tests of the 14 recombinants' immunoreactivity against all 20 patient sera were performed using ELISA and inhibition ELISA. Of the 14 tested recombinants only five were reactive with the patient sera, one of the seven substitutions (R12) and four of the eight substitutions (R123, R124, R134, and R234). The other recombinants did not show reactivity above the reactivity against the recombinant α1(IV) NC1 (data not shown) and therefore not further evaluated. The reactive recombinants R12, R123, R134, and R234 were carefully analyzed again to establish their reactivity compared with the nine-substitution recombinant (S2), recombinant α3, and recombinant α1. In Fig. 2, the immunoblotting results are shown.ELISAThe recombinants were first analyzed using direct ELISA (Fig. 3). With this assay, we found no significant difference in reactivity for the R12 recombinant compared with the S2 protein.

DISCUSSIONCirculating autoantibodies against different parts of the α3(IV) chain, as well as antibodies against other α(IV) chains, are detected in serum from patients with Goodpasture disease (6Hellmark T.

Reeders S.T. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8402-8405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the major epitope region is found to be the N-terminal part of the α3(IV) NC1 (9Quinones S. Bernal D. Garcia-Sogo M. Elena S.F. Saus J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19780-19784Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Ryan J.J. Mason P.J. Pusey C.D. Turner N. Clin. Exp.

In this study we have further narrowed down and characterized the molecular properties of this epitope recognized by the pathogenic autoantibodies. A recombinant protein comprised of the α1(IV) NC1 domain with seven amino acids substituted to the corresponding ones from the α3 chain was constructed. This recombinant protein, R12, was recognized by the autoantibodies from all patients with Goodpasture disease, in both direct ELISA and in inhibition ELISA, to the same degree as recombinant α3. These results support the previous findings where we and others have localized the major epitope to the same region (13Netzer K.-O. Leinonen A. Boutaud A. Borza D.B. Todd P. Gunwar S. Langeveld J.P.

Interestingly, an overlapping T-cell epitope is found by Phelps and co-workers (20Phelps R.G. Jones V.L. Coughlan M. Turner A.N. Rees A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11440-11447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 21Phelps R.G. Rees A.J. Kidney Int. 1999; 56: 1638-1653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). However, if this process is initiated by a foreign immunogen, i.e. molecular mimicry, or if it is a self-immunization with degraded type IV collagen, is yet unknown.As shown in Fig. 5 a, the epitope is localized to a small loop in the secondary sequence. The epitope seems to be dependent on correct folding of this loop, indicated both by the fact that disruption of the disulfide bridges (4Wieslander J. Langeveld J. Butkowski R. Jodlowski M. Noelken M. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8564-8570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,7Hellmark T. Brunmark C. Trojnar J. Wieslander J. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1996; 105: 504-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) as well as changes of the charge of certain residues disturb the immunoreactivity. This is shown by the substitutions in positions 3 and 4, of which one, but not both, of the resulting amino acids must have a negative charge for the epitope to be fully recognized. In R124 both residues are negatively charged, and in R123 both residues are uncharged, and in both, the changes result in a loss of affinity. The preservation of the positively charged lysine in position P2, seen in the S1 and R134 recombinants (Fig. 5 b), dramatically reduce affinity to the recombinants. Surprisingly, the R12, as well as the S2, R123, and R124, actually reacted stronger than the recombinant α3(IV) in the direct ELISA. This could possibly be explained by a less rigid structure in the α1(IV) background that results in a more accessible epitope. This theory is supported by the fact that this difference in reactivity did not appear when the recombinants were analyzed using inhibition ELISA. An alternative explanation for the higher reactivity could be that the produced recombinant, e.g. R12, displays an epitope more similar to a hypothetical mimicry structure than the native α3(IV) NC1 does.Although all samples recognize one very limited area on the α3(IV) NC1, there are some differences in recognition pattern between the different samples. As discussed above the effect of charge changes within the loop have different effect on antibodies from different sera (especially the R134). Furthermore the relative amount of antibodies against the epitope defined by the R12 constructs varies from serum to serum, ranging from 65 to 95%.We believe that this study of the Goodpasture epitope adds new and important data that will help us to understand the underlying immunological mechanisms in Goodpasture disease in particular, but also for autoimmune diseases in general. By using the R12 recombinant protein in an assay instead of the complete α3(IV) NC1, a more specific diagnostic test could be developed that could distinguish between pathogenic antibodies and harmless autoantibodies. Circulating autoantibodies against different parts of the α3(IV) chain, as well as antibodies against other α(IV) chains, are detected in serum from patients with Goodpasture disease (6Hellmark T.

https://openalex.org/W2033614517,"Results show that smooth muscle-specific promoters represent novel downstream targets of the winged helix factor hepatocyte nuclear factor-3 homologue 1 (HFH-1). HFH-1 strongly represses telokin promoter activity when overexpressed in A10 vascular smooth muscle cells. HFH-1 was also found to repress transcription of several other smooth muscle-specific promoters, including the SM22α promoter. HFH-1 inhibits telokin promoter activity, by binding to a forkhead consensus site located within an AT-rich region of the telokin promoter. The DNA-binding domain alone was sufficient to mediate inhibition, suggesting that binding of HFH-1 blocks the binding of other positive-acting factors. HFH-1 does not disrupt serum response factor binding to an adjacent CArG box within the telokin promoter, implying that HFH-1 must compete with other unidentified trans-activators to mediate repression. The localization of HFH-1 mRNA to the epithelial cell layer of mouse bladder and stomach implicates HFH-1 in repressing telokin expression in epithelial cells. This suggests that cell-specific expression of telokin is likely mediated by both positive-acting factors in smooth muscle cells and negative-acting factors in nonmuscle cell types. We propose a model in which the smooth muscle specificity of the telokin promoter is regulated by interactions between positive- and negative-acting members of the hepatocyte nuclear factor-3/forkhead family of transcription factors.

The differentiation state of smooth muscle is altered under many pathological conditions, such as atherosclerosis, restenosis following angioplasty, and chronic asthma (1Majesky M.W. Giachelli C.M. Reidy M.A. Schwartz S.M. Circ. Res. 1992; 71: 759-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 2Stewart A.G. Tomlinson P.R. Wilson J.T.I.P.S. Trends Pharmacol.

The changes that occur during these pathological conditions result in down-regulation of many proteins characteristic of adult smooth muscle (4Owens G.K. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 487-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar). Although the extracellular signals that influence the growth and differentiation state of smooth muscle have been studied extensively, little is known about the nuclear factors that control these processes (5Owens G.K. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1998; 164: 623-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). To begin to identify proteins that regulate the differentiation state of smooth muscle we initiated an analysis of mechanisms regulating expression of the telokingene. We have previously shown that telokin mRNA is transcribed from a second promoter located within an intron that interrupts the exons encoding the calmodulin-binding domain of the smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase (6Herring B.P. Smith A.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C1656-C1665Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike the smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase which has been detected in all adult tissues examined thus far, telokin protein and mRNA expression is restricted to smooth muscle tissues and cells (6Herring B.P.

Although its physiological function is unclear, telokin has been shown to bind to unphosphorylated myosin filaments and to stimulate myosin mini-filament assembly in vitro. Consequently, it has been proposed that telokin may play an important role in maintaining the stability of unphosphorylated myosin filaments in vivo (9Shirinsky V.P. Vorotnikov A.V. Birukov K.G.

Recently, telokin has also been reported to mediate smooth muscle relaxation through the activation of myosin light chain phosphatase (11Wu X. Haystead T.A. Nakamoto R.K. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11362-11369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The regulatory regions of several smooth muscle-specific genes including the telokin, smooth muscle myosin heavy chain, SM22α, smooth muscle α- and γ-actingenes have been studied in order to identify transcription factors that regulate their expression. Analysis of these genes in transgenic mice has revealed that each transgene exhibits a distinct pattern of expression in different smooth muscle tissues (6Herring B.P. Smith A.F. Am. J.

Both the telokin and γ-actin transgenes are expressed at high levels in visceral smooth muscle and lower levels in vascular smooth muscle (6Herring B.P. Smith A.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C1656-C1665Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,13Qian J. Kumar A. Szucsik J.C. Lessard J.L. Dev. Dyn. 1996; 207: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In contrast, the mouse SM22α promoter directs transgene expression specifically to arterial smooth muscle in adult mice (14Kim S. Ip H.S. Lu M.M. Clendenin C. Parmacek M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2266-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar,15Li L. Miano J.M. Mercer B. Olson E.N. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 849-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) and the smooth muscle myosin and α-actin promoters direct high levels of transgene expression to all smooth muscle tissues (12Mack C.P.

Res. 1998; 82: 908-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The pattern of expression of these transgenes in various smooth muscle tissues suggests that distinct regulatory elements, and presumably distinct transcription factors, are required for expression of a single gene in different smooth muscle tissues. To date no transcription factors have been identified that are expressed only in smooth muscle cells, however, several more generally expressed factors have been shown to be important for the expression of smooth muscle proteins. These include positive-acting factors present in smooth muscle cells, such as SRF,1 MEF2B, TEF-1, p53 (12Mack C.P. Owens G.K. Circ.

Of the factors currently identified SRF appears to play a central role in the expression of many different smooth muscle-specific genes including thesmooth muscle myosin heavy chain gene, smooth muscle α- and γ-actin genes, calponin, SM22α, andtelokin genes (14Kim S.

Biol. 1998; 194: 18-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Although SRF is expressed in all tissues, its expression is greatest in muscle tissues (32Belaguli N.S. Schildmeyer L.A. Schwartz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18222-18231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In addition to being important for growth factor regulation of genes, SRF has been shown to be important for the tissue-specific expression of the skeletal and cardiac muscle α-actin genes as well as several smooth muscle-specific genes (33Croissant J.D. Kim J.H. Eichele G. Goering L. Lough J. Prywes R. Schwartz R.J. Dev. Biol. 1996; 177: 250-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 34Chen C.Y. Croissant J. Majesky M. Topouzis S. McQuinn T. Frankovsky M.J. Schwartz R.J. Dev. Genet. 1996; 19: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). SRF has also been shown to be important for the differentiation of proepicardial cells into coronary vascular smooth muscle cells (35Landerholm T.E. Dong X.R. Lu J. Belaguli N.S. Schwartz R.J. Majesky M.W. Development. 1999; 126: 2053-2062Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the cardiac muscle α-actin gene SRF has been shown to interact with other tissue-restricted transcription factors to mediate cell-specific expression (36Chen C.Y. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6372-6384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism by which SRF regulates the cell-specific expression of smooth muscle-specific genes has not yet been resolved. For the telokin gene we have shown that an AT-rich region adjacent to the CArG element that binds SRF is important for promoter activity. The AT-rich region in the telokin promoter has been shown to bind both TATA-binding protein and myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF2), although disruption of MEF2 binding had no effect on reporter gene activity in A10 cells (18Herring B.P. Smith A.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1394-C1404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, mutation of the telokin TATA sequence to the TATA sequence of the thymidine kinase gene abolished promoter activity suggesting that this region is important, yet may not be simply functioning as a TATA box. Together these data suggest that there are likely to be transcription factors that bind to the AT-rich region of the telokin promoter and regulate promoter activity, perhaps through an interaction with SRF bound to the adjacent CArG element. In the current study we utilized a yeast one-hybrid screening procedure to identify factors that can bind to the AT-rich core of the telokin promoter. From this analysis we isolated a transcription factor of the forkhead family, HFH-1, that binds to the AT-rich region of the telokin promoter. HFH-1 is expressed at high levels in adult stomach and bladder and at lower levels in several other smooth muscle tissues. In stomach HFH-1 expression was found to be largely restricted to the epithelial cells of the mucosa. HFH-1 was found to repress the transcription of telokin and other smooth muscle-specific reporter genes. The repression of reporter gene activity is mediated by the forkhead domain of HFH-1 and does not appear to involve inhibition of SRF binding to the promoter. These data suggest that the cell-restricted expression of telokin and other smooth muscle-specific genes is likely to be controlled by the activity of positive-acting factors in smooth muscle cells together with negative regulatory factors such as HFH-1 in other cell types. A core fragment of the telokin promoter that includes a putative E box, an AT-rich region, and a CArG box was generated by annealing sense and antisense oligonucleotides. The sequence of the sense oligonucleotide was AATTCTGCAGTTGCTTTATATAAACTATCCCTTTTATGGGAGC. Three tandem copies of the core fragment were ligated into pHISi-1 and pLacZi (CLONTECH). Sequencing confirmed that each of the fragments were present in the 5′-3′ orientation relative to the minimal yeast promoter. The core-pHISi-1 and core-pLacZi plasmids were linearized at XhoI and NcoI sites, respectively, and sequentially integrated into the host yeast strain YM4271 to generate a dual yeast reporter strain. Growth of the telokin core promoter yeast reporter strain was suppressed by the addition of 45 mm 3-aminotriazole. The yeast strain exhibited no background β-galactosidase activity. A cDNA activation domain fusion library was generated in pGAD10 from poly(A)+mRNA isolated from adult mouse bladder using a two-hybrid cDNA library construction kit (CLONTECH). Plasmid DNA was obtained from the library according to the manufacturer's directions. Purified plasmid DNA (20 μg) was transformed into the core telokin promoter yeast reporter strain and positive colonies were initially selected by their ability to grow in the absence of histidine and uracil and in the presence of 45 mm3-aminotriazole. The library screening plates were then transferred onto filter paper and analyzed for β-galactosidase activity. Positive colonies were isolated and replated and the process was repeated until each colony represented a single clone. Plasmid DNA was isolated from the yeast clones by standard procedures (37Hoffman C.S. Winston F. Gene ( Amst. ). 1987; 57: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (2021) Google Scholar, 38Kaiser P. Auer B. BioTechniques. 1993; 14: 552PubMed Google Scholar) and used to transform electrocompetent DH5α Escherichia coli. Plasmids were recovered from the bacteria by standard procedures and subjected to automated DNA sequencing. cDNA prepared from mouse bladder as described above was ligated to λgt11 arms and packaged into phage particles using Giga Pack Gold (Promega). The resultant primary library was amplified and screened by standard procedures (39). Nitrocellulose filters were hybridized at 65 °C overnight with a32P-probe corresponding to the NotI fragment of the HFH-1 clone obtained from the yeast library screen. This fragment corresponds to nucleotides 2502 to 3252 bp of the published Hfh-1L genomic clone sequence. Filters were washed in 2 × SSPE + 1.0% SDS at room temperature for 15 min, 2 × SSPE + 1.0% SDS at 65 °C for 15 min followed by 0.2 × SSPE + 0.1% SDS at 65° for 10 min. λ DNA was isolated using Lambdasorb (Promega), digested with NotI, and the resulting fragments were subcloned into pGEM 5Z (Promega) and sequenced by automated sequencing. Total RNA was isolated from adult tissues using a single step guanidinium isothiocyanate procedure (39) and 15 μg were separated on a 1.2% formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred to a nylon membrane under vacuum. Hybridization was carried out at 65 °C overnight with the same probe used for λ library screening. Final wash conditions were, 2 × SSPE + 1.0% SDS for 10 min 65 °C. A 171-bp fragment of the HFH-1 cDNA (corresponding to nucleotides 2502–2673) was subcloned into pGEM 7Z (Promega). The plasmid was linearized with SalI and a 32P-labeled antisense riboprobe was generated using SP6 polymerase and a MaxiScript In Vitro Transcription kit according to the manufacturer's directions (Ambion). The full-length HFH-1 transcript (213 bases) was gel purified on a 6% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea gel and eluted overnight at 37 °C. Ribonuclease protection assays were then performed according to the manufacturer's directions (Standard RPA II kit; Ambion). Briefly, 1 × 105 cpm of gel purified HFH-1 riboprobe was co-precipitated with 20 μg of RNA and hybridized overnight at 42 °C. Samples were digested with RNase A/T1 at 1:150 dilution for 30 min at 37 °C and then inactivated and precipitated. Samples were solubilized in 8 μl of gel loading buffer and one-half volume was loaded onto a 6% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea gel run at 55 watts for 2 h. 35S-Sequencing reactions were run alongside samples to verify the size of the probe and protected fragments. mRNA in situhybridization was performed on 10-μm cryosections of mouse bladder and stomach as described previously (40Lyons G.E. Schiaffino S. Sassoon D. Barton P. Buckingham M. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2427-2436Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 41Patapoutian A. Miner J.H. Lyons G.E. Wold B. Development. 1993; 118: 61-69Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The HFH-1 probe used was identical to the riboprobe used for RNase protection analysis, except that 35S-nucleotides were used for labeling. The 180-nucleotide mouse telokin probe used corresponds to residues 53–233 of the mouse telokin cDNA. This probe is specific for telokin and does not cross-react with myosin light chain kinase. 2Herring, B. P., Lyons, G. E., Hoggatt, A. M., and Gallagher, P. J. (2000) Am. J. Physiol.: Cell Physiol., in press. Antisense probes were generated using T7 RNA polymerase and sense probes using SP6 RNA polymerase. Hybridization was carried out at 50° for 16–18 h. Final wash conditions were 0.1 × SSC at 37 °C. All promoter reporter genes were constructed by cloning fragments of promoters into the pGL2B luciferase vector (Promega). The rabbit telokin promoter-luciferase reporter gene used includes nucleotides −256 to +147 of the telokin gene as described previously (6Herring B.P. Smith A.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C1656-C1665Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The SM22α-luciferase reporter gene includes nucleotides −475 to +61 of the mouse SM22α gene (43Solway J. Seltzer J. Samaha F.F. Kim S. Alger L.E. Niu Q. Morrisey E.E. Ip H.S. Parmacek M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13460-13469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The smooth muscle α-actin promoter fragment extended from nucleotide −1075 to +46 (44Min B. Foster D.N. Strauch A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16667-16675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the smooth muscle myosin heavy chain promoter from nucleotide −1175 to +47. The minimal TK promoter used comprised nucleotides −113 to +20 of the thymidine kinase gene. The AT/CArG TK construct contained two copies of the AT-rich region-CArG box from the telokin promoter (−90 to −51) upstream of the minimal TK promoter. Promoter fragments were isolated by polymerase chain reaction using mouse genomic DNA as a template and the following oligonucleotides; SM22α sense, GTTTGCATAGTGCCTGGTTGTGCAGCCAGG; SM22α antisense, GCTTGGTCGTTTGTGGACTGGAAGGAGAG; smooth muscle α-actin sense, CCGGTACCACACCATAAAACAAGTGCATGAGC; smooth muscle α-actin antisense, CTAAGCTTGACAGCGACTGGCTGGGCTTC; smooth muscle myosin heavy chain sense, GAGGCTGCACGGGACCATATTTAGTCAG; smooth muscle myosin heavy chain antisense, GAGCTCGGATCTGACACTGATCCCAGGC. Polymerase chain reaction fragments were cloned into pCRBlunt (Invitrogen), sequenced and then subcloned into pGL2B (Promega). For expression in mammalian cells a fragment of the HFH-1 cDNA encoding the coding region was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into pcDNA 3.1 His-C (Invitrogen). This results in the expression of HFH-1 fused in-frame at the amino terminus to 6×His and X-press epitope tags. Truncated forms of HFH-1 were generated by subcloning partial cDNA clones into pcDNA 3.1 His. The resultant plasmids were sequenced to verify the integrity of the inserts. Plasmids were transfected into rat A10 vascular smooth muscle cells using Fugene (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). A10 cells were grown in high glucose DMEM containing 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 20% fetal bovine serum. Cells to be transfected were seeded at 1.4 × 105 cells/dish in 35-mm dishes. 16–18 h post-seeding each dish was washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, replaced with 2 ml of complete media, incubated with a total of 2 μg of plasmid DNA (1 μg of telokin-luciferase, 0.5 μg of HFH-1 expression plasmid, and 0.5 μg of pRL-luciferase as an internal control) and 3 μl of Fugene in 0.1 ml of DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.). 24 h later 10 μl of cleared extracts (400 μl/dish) were prepared for dual luciferase assays. Assays were performed using a dual luciferase reporter assay system according to the manufacture's directions (Promega). Reporter gene luciferase activities were normalized to the luciferase activity of the internal control. Full-length human SRF and mouse HFH-1 were expressed in bacteria using the pET expression system (Novagen). The coding region of each cDNA was isolated by polymerase chain reaction, sequenced, and cloned into pET28a. SRF and HFH-1 protein expression was induced by addition of 0.4 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 1 h. SRF lysates were prepared by sonicating bacterial pellets in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 500 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml lysozyme. HFH-1 lysates were prepared by sonicating bacterial pellets in 20 mm Tris, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 8m urea, 500 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cleared lysates were incubated with Talon beads (CLONTECH), pre-equilibrated in lysis buffer. Bound proteins were washed with lysis buffer containing 10 mm imidazole and the purified proteins eluted with 100 mm imidazole. Eluted proteins were dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% glycerol and stored at −70 °C. Mobility shift assays were performed in a final volume of 15 μl. Binding mixes contained 0.2 ng (1.5 × 104 cpm) of end-labeled double stranded DNA probe, 200 ng of salmon sperm DNA, 4.5 μg of bovine serum albumin, and various amounts of expressed, recombinant protein, purified fromE. coli as indicated, in a binding buffer containing 12 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 4 mmMgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol. All binding reactions were incubated for 20 min at room temperature then loaded onto a 4% polyacrylamide gel (containing 6.75 mmTris, pH 7.9, 3.3 mm Na acetate, pH 7.9, 1 mmEDTA, 2.5% glycerol). A 200-fold excess of unlabeled double stranded oligonucleotide competitors was included in some reactions as indicated in the figure legends. The following cell lines were used for analysis of HFH-1 expression, A10 smooth muscle cells (ATCC), NIH3T3 fibroblasts (ATCC), undifferentiated mouse embryonic stem cells, ESD3 (a gift from Mike Klug, Krannert Institute of Cardiology, Indianapolis, IN), REF52 fibroblasts (a gift from Dr. P Gallagher, Indiana University, Indianapolis, IN), and SV40 large T-antigen transformed intestinal smooth muscle cells, GI SMC. 3P. Herring, unpublished data. A10 cells were grown in DMEM containing 20% fetal bovine serum, 3T3 cells, REF52 cells, and GI SMC were grown in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. ESD3 cells were grown in DMEM containing 15% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, supplemented with recombinant leukemia inhibitory factor. Two positive clones were obtained from a one-hybrid screen of a mouse bladder cDNA library using the telokin core promoter yeast reporter strain. Both clones contained identical 750-bp inserts. Comparison of the sequences with the GeneBank data base revealed a 100% identity to the previously identified mouse forkhead transcription factor Hfh-1L (Fig.1) (45Frank S. Zoll B. DNA Cell Biol. 1998; 17: 679-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The clones isolated spanned nucleotides 2502–3252 of the published intronless-Hfh-1L genomic clone (accession number AF010405), which includes the region encoding the forkhead DNA-binding domain. To verify that the clones isolated were responsible for activating the yeast reporter strain the purified plasmids were retransformed into the yeast reporter strain. Following transformation the resultant yeast colonies stained positive for β-galactosidase activity (data not shown), indicating that the cDNAs encoded by the plasmids were indeed responsible for activating the reporter strain.Figure 4HFH-1 inhibits smooth muscle-specific promoter activity. A10 vascular smooth muscle cells were transiently transfected with a promoter-luciferase reporter gene and either an HFH-1 expression vector or an empty vector together with an internal control renilla luciferase plasmid, as indicated. At 24 h following transfection, cells were lysed and assayed for luciferase activity. Promoter activity was normalized to the internal control (renilla luciferase). Data presented are represent the activity of the reporter gene in the presence of HFH-1 expressed as the mean percentage (± S.E.) of reporter gene activity in the absence of HFH-1, obtained from 6 to 20 independent transfections.

Toxicity was assessed via two cell viability assays. We found that this endocytic receptor conferred protection against amyloid β-protein toxicity in the presence of activated α2-macroglobulin and its down-regulation via inhibition by receptor-associated protein or transfection of cells with presenilin 1, increased susceptibility to amyloid β-protein toxicity. Increased surface LRP immunoreactivity in response to amyloid β-protein challenge was associated with increased translocation of LRP from the endoplasmic reticulum to the surface, rather than from increased mRNA or protein expression. Furthermore, this translocation of LRP to the surface was mediated by a calcium/calmodulin protein kinase II-dependent signaling pathway. These studies provide evidence for a protective role of LRP against amyloid β-protein toxicity and may explain the aggressive nature of presenilin-1 mutation in familial Alzheimer's disease.

In addition, patients with probable AD have increased serum levels of LRP ligands including apoE, α1-antichymotrypsin, plasmin, and urokinase (11Aoyagi T. Wada T. Kojima F. Nagai M. Harada S.

Lett. 1997; 223: 29-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), suggesting that LRP expression (or function) may be deficient in these patients. Furthermore, we have previously shown that overexpression of or mutations in the presenilin 1 (PS1) gene, which has been closely linked to the majority of early onset familial AD cases, results in significant down-regulation of LRP (5Van Uden E. Carlson G. St. George-Hyslop P. Westaway D. Orlando R. Mallory M. Rockenstein E. Masliah E. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1999; 14: 129-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data indicate that LRP plays a central role in AD pathogenesis. Although the mechanisms through which LRP might be involved in AD remain unclear, a recent study has suggested a role for LRP in clearance of amyloid β-protein (Aβ) (14Qiu Z. Strickland D.K. Hyman B.T. Rebeck G.W. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1393-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Specifically, Aβ is internalized by LRP when bound to apoE or *α2m (14Qiu Z. Strickland D.K. Hyman B.T. Rebeck G.W. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1393-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 15Haas C. Cazorla P. Miguel C.D. Valdivieso F. Vaazquez J. Biochem.

Vandekerckhove J. Rosseneu M. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 230-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Whether this effect is toxic or protective is not completely known. Thus, the main objective of the present study was to determine if addition of an Aβ-binding LRP ligand prevents Aβ toxicity. The results suggest that LRP mediates protection against Aβ toxicity in the presence of *α2m and that LRP surface expression is preferentially up-regulated in response to Aβ challenge via a calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM KII)-dependent mechanism. Furthermore, PS1-transfected C6 cells, which are more susceptible to Aβ toxicity relative to vector-transfected control cells, do not show this protective LRP up-regulation in response to Aβ challenge. These studies provide evidence for a protective role of LRP against Aβ toxicity and may explain the rapid progression of familial AD linked to mutations in the PS1 gene. Since glial activation is a pathological hallmark of AD and glia have been shown to undergo apoptosis in AD cases (19Li W.P. Chan W.Y. Lai H.W. Yew D.T. J. Mol. Neurosci. 1997; 8: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 20Masliah E. Mallory M. Alford M. Tanaka S. Hansen L.A. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1998; 57: 1041-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), we used C6 glioma cells for our studies. Furthermore, these cells express high levels of LRP and can be easily transfected (5Van Uden E. Carlson G. St. George-Hyslop P. Westaway D. Orlando R. Mallory M. Rockenstein E. Masliah E. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1999; 14: 129-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained at 37 °C (5% CO2 atmosphere) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS). Human wild type and mutant PS1 (M146L) stably transfected C6 cells were also used for these experiments as described previously (5Van Uden E. Carlson G. St. George-Hyslop P. Westaway D. Orlando R.

For the surface and viability assays, cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 105/cm2. Two days after seeding, cells were treated for 24 h with Aβ 1–40 (5–20 μm, Sigma) in the presence or absence of *α2m. Aβ 1–40 was selected for these studies because this peptide has been shown to complex with *α2m and to be cytotoxic (17Narita M. Holtzman D.M. Schwartz A.L. Bu G. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1904-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 21Du Y. Ni B. Glinn M. Dodel R.C. Bales K.R. Zhang Z. Hyslop P.A. Paul S.M. J.

Control experiments were performed by incubation with *α2m alone or the reverse peptide Aβ 40–1 (5–20 μm, Sigma). Excess methylamine was removed by filtration on a PD-10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the activated α2m (*α2m) was incubated with Aβ 1–40 in a 8:1 molar ratio in PBS for 24–72 h at 37 °C. Similar conditions have previously been shown to induce complexation of *α2m with Aβ (17Narita M. Holtzman D.M. Schwartz A.L. Bu G. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1904-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 21Du Y. Ni B. Glinn M. Dodel R.C. Bales K.R. Zhang Z. Hyslop P.A. Paul S.M. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 299-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The Aβ:*α2m solution was used at a working concentration of 10 μm (based on the starting free Aβ concentration). Receptor-associated protein (RAP)-glutathione S-transferase fusion protein (200 nm), an LRP ligand, and potent LRP antagonist was used as described previously (25Czekay R.P. Orlando R.A. Woodward L. Adamson E.D. Farquhar M.G. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1433-1441PubMed Google Scholar, 26Orlando R.A. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4082-4086Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Fucoidan (Sigma), a scavenger receptor inhibitor was used at 200 ng/ml. All kinase inhibitors were purchased from Alexis Corp. (San Diego, CA) unless otherwise noted. KN93 (specific CaM KII inhibitor), KN92 (inactive control compound for KN93), KT 5720 (cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor), bisindolylmaleimide IX methanosulfonate (specific protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor), and staurosporine (Sigma) were prepared as 1000-fold stock solutions and used at concentrations of 500 nm to 1 μm. The CaM KII assay system (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used to assess CaM KII activity following Aβ challenge. Surface LRP levels were determined via immunocytochemical detection on a fluorescence-activated cell scanner (FACScan, Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Briefly, cells were trypsinized and washed with FACS buffer (1.5% FBS in PBS). Cell pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of the monoclonal anti-LRP primary antibody (5A6, 1:1500, kindly provided by Dr. D. Strickland) diluted in FACS buffer and incubated at 4 °C for 45 min. Parallel samples were incubated with anti-IgG1 isotype control (for nonspecific staining), mouse monoclonal anti-transferrin receptor (1:1000, Chemicon International, Temecula, CA), or mouse monoclonal anti-LDL-R (1:1000, Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) (control for surface receptor expression). Cells were then incubated for 45 min at 4 °C with 1:50 diluted secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse FITC for LRP, transferrin, and LDL-R) (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Cells were pelleted and resuspended in FACS buffer containing 1 μg/ml propidium iodide. Ten thousand cells per condition were collected on a FACScan flow cytometer using a 488-nm argon laser at empirically determined instrument settings. Median FL1 (FITC) fluorescence values of live cells were determined for anti-LRP-stained and control cells, and dead cells were excluded from analysis on the basis of their propidium iodine fluorescence on FL3. Additional analysis of LRP localization was performed by double-immunolabeling and laser scanning confocal microscopy. Briefly, as described previously (5Van Uden E. Carlson G. St. George-Hyslop P. Westaway D. Orlando R. Mallory M. Rockenstein E. Masliah E. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1999; 14: 129-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), cells were plated on poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips, treated in the presence or absence of Aβ/*α2m as described above and fixed for 20 min with 2% paraformaldehyde. Cells were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with the rabbit polyclonal antibody against RAP (1:40,000), followed by detection with the Tyramide Signal Amplification™-Direct (Red) system (NEN Life Science Products), followed by an overnight incubation with the rabbit polyclonal anti-LRP456 (1:100) and FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (1:75, Vector). This approach allows the identification of two different antigens using primary antibodies generated in the same species. In addition, cells were also incubated overnight at 4 °C with a mixture of anti-LRP456 (1:1000) (25Czekay R.P. Orlando R.A. Woodward L. Adamson E.D. Farquhar M.G. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1433-1441PubMed Google Scholar, 26Orlando R.A. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4082-4086Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and the mouse monoclonal anti-protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI, StressGen Biotechnologies, Victoria, Canada) a marker of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Next day coverslips were incubated with the FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and Texas Red-conjugated horse anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Vector). Immunolabeled coverslips were then air-dried, placed cell-side up on SuperFrost slides (Fisher Scientific, Tustin), coverslipped with anti-fading media (Vector) and imaged with the laser scanning confocal microscope (MRC1000, Bio-Rad). The signal corresponding to LRP immunoreactivity was visualized in the FITC channel, while the one corresponding to the ER was visualized in the Texas Red channel. In order to assess changes in LRP transcriptional levels, we utilized the ribonuclease protection assay. Riboprobe templates were amplified by PCR from human and mouse cDNA. For the PS1 template, a 305-base pair fragment corresponding to bases 1133–1437 of human PS1 (GenBank accession no.L76517) was obtained and subcloned into pCR II (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA). For the mouse and rat LRP templates, a 225-base pair fragment corresponding to bases 2378–2601 of mouse LRP (GenBank accession no. X67469) was similarly isolated and subcloned. An actin riboprobe complementary to nucleotides 480–559 of mouse β actin was used to normalize any variations in loading or mRNA concentration (GenBank accession no. M18194). RPAs were carried out with32P-labeled antisense riboprobes, and signals were quantified with a PhosphorImager and the ImageQuant software, as described previously (5Van Uden E. Carlson G.

In order to determine if LRP up-regulation occurred at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional levels, LRP immunoreactivity was measured by Western blot analysis. Briefly, pellets of whole cell homogenates were sonicated for 30 s in HEPES homogenization buffer (1 mm HEPES, 5 mm benzamidine, 2 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 3 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmmagnesium sulfate, 0.05% sodium azide, 0.01 mg/ml leupeptin). Protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry, and between 10 and 15 μg of protein were loaded onto 10% Tris-glycine ready gels (Bio-Rad). The samples were then electroblotted to nitrocellulose membranes and analyzed with the rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against C-terminal LRP (1073, 1:5000, kindly provided by Dr. R. Orlando). Blots were placed in phosphor screens and imaged with the PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) to assess levels of immunoreactivity. Genomic DNA undergoes extensive DNA fragmentation into oligonucleosomal subunits late in apoptotic cell death. These DNA fragments are divided into apoptotic bodies, while both the nuclear and plasma membranes of these bodies remain intact. A flow cytometric method of Nicoletti et al. (28Nicoletti I. Migliorati G. Pagliacci M.C. Grignani F. Riccardi C. J. Neuroimmunol. Methods. 1991; 139: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (4426) Google Scholar) was used to assess the percentage of fragmented nuclei. This assay is highly correlated (R 2 = 0.82) with percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis as determined via annexin-V staining (data not shown). Briefly, cell nuclei were stained with a hypotonic lysis buffer containing 50 μ g/ml propidium iodide to stain DNA at 4 °C for at least 2 h. Samples were then run on a FACScan (Becton Dickinson) to quantitate DNA fragmentation on the FL3 channel (propidium iodide). Debris was excluded from collection of 10,000 nuclei by empirical setting of forward scatter channel and side scatter channel threshold levels. Apoptotic nuclear bodies appeared as a broad hypodiploid peak easily discernible from the narrow peak of cells with normal diploid DNA content. The MTT assay used to assess cell viability is based on the ability of viable cells to convert MTT (a tetrazolium salt) into a blue formazan product. Following a 24-h treatment with various reagents as per the experimental design, 10 μl of MTT solution (2.5 mg/ml) was added to each well and cells were incubated overnight at 37 °C. Next, 100 μl of solubilization solution (50% dimethylformamide and 20% sodium dodecyl sulfate, pH 4.7) was added to the wells and cells were incubated overnight. Plates were then read at 570 nm using a Thermomax microplate reader (Molecular Devices). All experiments were done at least in triplicate and blind-coded. After results were obtained, the code was broken and averaged according to the experimental group and design. All values were expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was done using the StatView program (Abacus Concepts, Cary, NC) by one-way ANOVA with post hoc Scheffe. Although previous studies have shown that LRP mediates clearance of Aβ when bound to *α2m (14Qiu Z. Strickland D.K. Hyman B.T. Rebeck G.W. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1393-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), it has not been determined if this internalization is protective. To this end, C6 cells were incubated with Aβ 1–40 in the presence or absence of *α2m, and toxicity was assessed via FACS analysis of DNA fragmentation, and the MTT assay. We found that in cells treated with free Aβ (10 μm) approximately 50% of the nuclear bodies were apoptotic (Fig. 1 A). In the presence of *α2m, Aβ-induced apoptosis was significantly decreased to 31.2 ± 2.4% (Fig. 1 A). Treatment with RAP (200 nm), a potent LRP antagonist, ameliorated this protective effect and significantly increased the percentage of apoptotic bodies to 52.4 ± 2.8% (Fig.1 A). Concomitant RAP treatment did not alter observed apoptosis in cells treated with Aβ alone (Fig. 1 A). Similar effects on cell viability were observed by the MTT assay (Fig.1 B). Specifically, in cells challenged with Aβ, concomitant *α2m significantly increased viability and this effect was ameliorated by addition of RAP (Fig. 1 B). Since it is possible that, in addition to LRP, the observed protective effects may be mediated through other Aβ receptors, cells were also treated with fucoidan (200 ng/ml), a scavenger receptor inhibitor. This compound had no effect on toxicity in the presence or absence or *α2m (data not shown), further supporting the contention that the observed effects are mediated by LRP. Since previous studies have shown that LRP is up-regulated in response to neuronal injury (29Lopes M.B. Bogaev C.A. Gonias S.L. VandenBerg S.R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 338: 301-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and it has been implicated in Aβ clearance (14Qiu Z. Strickland D.K. Hyman B.T. Rebeck G.W. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1393-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), it is possible that LRP expression and/or subcellular compartmentalization might be modified in response to Aβ challenge. To this end, LRP levels were measured via FACS analysis, ribonuclease protection assay, and Western blot. Additional qualitative analysis was done by immunocytochemistry/laser scanning confocal microscopy. Consistent with previous studies (5Van Uden E. Carlson G. St. George-Hyslop P. Westaway D. Orlando R. Mallory M. Rockenstein E. Masliah E. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1999; 14: 129-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), LRP immunoreactivity was preferentially observed both at the cell surface and in the cytoplasm where it was colocalized with the ER marker PDI (Fig.2 A). Treatment with *α2m alone (Fig. 2 B) or reverse Aβ peptide (Fig. 2 C) had no effect. Upon challenge with Aβ 1–40 and *α2m, LRP immunoreactivity was observed predominantly on the cell surface and, to a lesser extent, in the ER (Fig. 2,D and E). Similar results were in double-labeling experiments with the chaperone protein RAP, which is primarily localized in the ER (data not shown). Consistent with this, FACS analysis showed that surface LRP levels increased 2-fold after 24 h of treatment (Fig. 3, A and B). Free Aβ 1–40 increased surface LRP levels by 45.0 ± 17.2% (Figs. 2 C and 3 B). Control experiments where cells were immunolabeled with IgG isotype, anti-transferrin receptor, or anti-LDL-R did not show concomitant up-regulation upon Aβ challenge (data not shown). Additionally, treatment with other LRP ligands including *α2m (Figs.2 C and 3 B), RAP (data not shown), and apoE (data not shown), or the reverse peptide, Aβ 40–1 (Fig. 2 E), did not result in LRP up-regulation.Figure 3Surface LRP levels increase in response to Aβ challenge. A, a representative FL1 FACS histogram showed the shift in fluorescence values in untreated versus Aβ:*α2m-treated cells. B, Aβ 1–40 alone increased surface LRP immunoreactivity in C6 cells, while preincubation of Aβ with activated α2m (Aβ:*α2m) resulted in over a 2-fold increase in surface LRP expression. *, p< 0.05 by one-way ANOVA with post hoc Scheffe.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In order to determine whether the observed LRP up-regulation occurred at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional levels, total protein and RNA were measured by Western blot and ribonuclease protection assay. No evidence of increase in protein or message was observed after 24 h of treatment (data not shown), suggesting that the observed increase in surface LRP immunoreactivity was due to translocation of LRP from reserve stores. We have previously shown that overexpression of wild-type or mutant PS1 (M146L) down-regulates LRP total protein and RNA levels (5Van Uden E. Carlson G. St. George-Hyslop P. Westaway D. Orlando R. Mallory M. Rockenstein E. Masliah E. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1999; 14: 129-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Thus, we hypothesized that wild-type and mutant PS1-transfected cells would be more susceptible to Aβ toxicity relative to vector-transfected controls. Both wild-type and mutant PS1-transfected cells were significantly more susceptible to Aβ toxicity both in the presence or absence of *α2m (Fig.4 A). Apoptosis increased almost 2-fold in the PS1-transfected cells compared with vector controls when challenged with Aβ (Fig. 4 A). In addition, Aβ-challenged PS1 transfectants showed correlative decreases in cell viability as measured by MTT absorbance (data not shown). Although a protective effect of *α2m was observed in vector-transfected controls, in wild-type or mutant PS1-tranfected cells no change in toxicity was observed either with addition of RAP (data not shown) or *α2m. Thus, we hypothesized that functional LRP was significantly decreased in these PS1 transfectants. FACS analysis of LRP surface expression showed that levels in wild type and mutant PS1 stably transfected cells were significantly decreased by approximately 30% and 40%, respectively (Fig. 4 B). Furthermore, wild-type and mutant PS1- transfected cells did not show an up-regulation of surface LRP levels in response to Aβ challenge, whereas vector-transfected C6 cells responded with a 2-fold increase comparable to non-transfected C6 wild type controls (Fig.4 C). These results indicate that susceptibility to Aβ in PS1-transfected cells may be due not only to decreased LRP levels but also to the inability of these cells to up-regulate LRP expression to a level necessary for protection. In order to determine which signaling cascade is important for LRP translocation, cells were treated with various kinase inhibitors upon Aβ challenge in the presence of *α2m. Surface LRP up-regulation was inhibited by the CaM KII inhibitor, KN93 (1 μm) (Fig. 5 A). Staurosporine (1 μm), a broad spectrum protein kinase inhibitor (known to inhibit PKA, PKC, and CaM KII) also ameliorated the Aβ-induced up-regulation (Fig. 5 A). The specific PKC inhibitor, bisindolylmaleimide IX methanosulfonate (1 μm), the specific cAMP-dependent kinase (PKA) inhibitor, KT5720 (1 μm), or the control peptide KN92 (1 μm) did not affect LRP translocation (Fig.5 A). Similar effects of inhibition of LRP up-regulation upon KN93 or staurosporine treatment were observed with Aβ 1–40 alone (data not shown). This inhibition increased cell death only when cells were challenged with Aβ in the presence of *α2m (Fig.5 B). Levels of CaM KII activity were determined via measurement of phosphorylation of autocamtide 3, a CaM KII-specific substrate peptide. A significant increase in CaM KII activity in response to Aβ:*α2m challenge was observed (Fig.6). Addition of KN93, a CaM KII inhibitor, significantly decreased activity by approximately 30% below base line (i.e. activity in untreated cells). Similar results were observed with Aβ peptide alone (Fig. 6). These results indicate that increased translocation of LRP from the ER to the cell surface upon Aβ challenge involves activation of the CaM KII pathway. The present study showed that LRP mediates protection against Aβ toxicity in the presence of *α2m and that this effect might be due to complexation of Aβ with activated α2m with subsequent clearance via LRP. In support of this possibility, inhibition of LRP via RAP or expression of PS1 (5Van Uden E. Carlson G. St. George-Hyslop P. Westaway D. Orlando R. Mallory M. Rockenstein E. Masliah E. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1999; 14: 129-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) significantly increased Aβ toxicity only in the presence of *α2m. Further supporting a role for LRP in protection against Aβ toxicity, we found that LRP surface expression increased in response to Aβ challenge. This effect was specific to Aβ (free or complexed) although it was more robust with complexed Aβ. The LDL-R and transferrin receptor did not show concomitant up-regulation in response to Aβ challenge. The mechanisms by which increased translocation of LRP from the ER to the surface decreased Aβ toxicity are not completely clear. One possibility is that surface LRP might increase Aβ clearance, which otherwise if remaining free on the cell surface may be toxic to the cells via generation of free radicals (30Markesbery W.R. Carney J.M. Brain Pathol. 1999; 9: 133-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). This is in accordance with a recent report by Qiu et al. (14Qiu Z. Strickland D.K. Hyman B.T. Rebeck G.W. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1393-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) in which *α2m was found to enhance clearance of endogenous soluble Aβ via LRP. However, since protection is associated with Aβ complexing with *α2m, then an alternative possibility is that *α2m may decrease formation of fibrillar Aβ (21Du Y. Ni B. Glinn M. Dodel R.C. Bales K.R.

Supporting this, previous studies have shown that preincubation of Aβ with *α2m resulted in decreased Aβ toxicity (14Qiu Z. Strickland D.K. Hyman B.T. Rebeck G.W. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1393-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). However, if this is the mechanism operating in our system, one would not expect to see the observed increase in toxicity by addition of LRP inhibitors (such as RAP), which by itself most likely does not alter the kinetics of fibrillar Aβ formation. Then, although *α2m might change the conformation of Aβ, our results suggest that clearance plays a more central role in protection against toxicity. Another finding of the present study was that translocation of LRP is mediated via a CaM KII mechanism since the specific inhibitor of this kinase, KN-93, blocked surface up-regulation of LRP and CaM KII activity increased in response to Aβ challenge. These effects were observed at doses as low as the high nanomolar range of Aβ (data not shown); thereby, a physiological role for the reported phenomenon could not be excluded. Interestingly, previous studies have also suggested that CaM KII, which is particularly abundant in the hippocampus, where it is believed to be involved in the modulation of neurotransmitter release and long term potentiation (32Arredondo L.

Furthermore, calmodulin, a CaM KII-binding protein, is required for the recycling of endocytosed receptors including transferrin and LDL, possibly through regulation of endosome fusion (38Apodaca G.

Taken together, these results suggest that CaM KII signaling might regulate LRP translocation from the ER to the surface. Although the effects of other Aβ receptors cannot be excluded, since in addition to LRP RAP also blocks other receptors (42Medh J.D. Fry G.L. Bowen S.L. Pladet M.W. Strickland D.K. Chappell D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 536-540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), there are reasons to believe that LRP is an important mediator of protection against Aβ toxicity. Specifically, of the three known Aβ receptors, the receptor for advanced glycation end products is believed to mediate the cytotoxic effects of Aβ and has limited expression in the adult central nervous system, while the scavenger receptor (SR) does not affect Aβ accumulation (3Kounnas M.Z.

In this regard, the present study showed that addition of the SR inhibitor fucoidan did not affect Aβ toxicity. Furthermore, in vivo studies in APP transgenic mice crossed with SR-knockout mice did not show either increased susceptibility to Aβ toxicity or increased plaque formation (10Rebeck G.W. Reiter J.S. Strickland D.K. Hyman B.T. Neuron. 1993; 11: 575-580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). In addition, a recent study showed that LRP plays an important role in regulating the generation of Aβ (47Ulery P.G. Beers J. Mikhailenko I. Tanzi R.E. Rebeck G.W. Hyman B.T. Strickland D.K. J. Biol.

Thus, these results support the contention that Aβ clearance is the central nervous system might occur primarily via LRP. In conclusion, these studies provide evidence for a protective role of LRP against Aβ toxicity via the complex formation with *α2m and may explain the rapid progression of familial AD linked to mutations in the PS1 gene."

These two proteins, although very homologous, particularly in the C-terminal region, which contains the highly conserved “α-crystallin domain,” show differences in their protective ability toward aggregation-prone target proteins. In order to investigate the differences between αA and αB crystallins, we engineered two chimeric proteins, αANBC and αBNAC, by swapping the N-terminal domains of αA and αB crystallins. The chimeras were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The purified recombinant wild-type and chimeric proteins were characterized by fluorescence and circular dichroism spectroscopy and gel permeation chromatography to study the changes in secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structure. Circular dichroism studies show structural changes in the chimeric proteins. αBNAC binds more 8-anilinonaphthalene-1-sulfonic acid than the αANBC and the wild-type proteins, indicating increased accessible hydrophobic regions. The oligomeric state of αANBC is comparable to wild-type αB homoaggregate. However, there is a large increase in the oligomer size of the αBNAC chimera. Interestingly, swapping domains results in complete loss of chaperone-like activity of αANBC, whereas αBNAC shows severalfold increase in its protective ability. Our findings show the importance of the N- and C-terminal domains of αA and αB crystallins in subunit oligomerization and chaperone-like activity.

We had earlier shown that α-crystallin can prevent photo-aggregation of γ-crystallin, which may have relevance in cataractogenesis (5.Raman B. Rao Ch.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27264-27268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By using various non-thermal modes of aggregation, it was shown that chaperone-like activity of α-crystallin is temperature-dependent. A structural perturbation above 30 °C enhances this activity severalfold (6.Raman B. Ramakrishna T. Rao C.M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 365: 133-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 7.Raman B.

In order to probe the molecular mechanism of the chaperone-like activity and its enhancement upon structural perturbation, we have been studying α-crystallin and its constituent subunits. Our recent study on the αA and αB homoaggregates showed that, despite high sequence homology, these proteins differ in their stability, chaperone-like activity, and the temperature dependence of this activity (8.Datta S.A.

This study also indicated different roles for the two proteins in the α-crystallin heteroaggregate in the eye lens and as separate proteins in non-lenticular tissues. Several investigators have introduced mutations in αA and αB crystallins to gain an insight into the structure-function relation (9.Smulders R.H.P.H. Merck K.B. Aendekerk J. Horwitz J. Takemoto L.

These mutations either result in some decrease or no change in the protective ability. It is interesting to note that point mutations in both αA and αB crystallin, R116C and R120G, respectively, result in significant loss of activity and are associated with human diseases (14.Vicart P.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5819-5823Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 21.Ngo J.T. Klisak I. Dubin R.A. Piatigorsky J. Genomics. 1989; 5: 665-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and are thought to have arisen due to gene duplication. They share high sequence homology with the small heat shock proteins, which are found in all organisms, from prokaryotes to humans (22.de Jong W.W. Caspers G.J. Leunissen J.A.M. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1998; 22: 151-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). αA and αB crystallins are constitutively expressed during normal growth and development. αA crystallin is expressed predominantly in the eye lens with small amounts being present in spleen and thymus (23.Kato K. Shinohara H. Kurobe N. Goto S. Inaguma Y. Ohshima K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1080: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), whereas αB crystallin is expressed not only in the eye lens, but also in several other tissues such as heart, skeletal muscle, placenta, lung, and kidney (24.Bhat S.P. Nagineni C.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 158: 319-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 25.Dubin R.A. Warwousek E.F. Piatigorsky J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1083-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The main function of these proteins in the lens appears to provide transparency and prevent precipitation by binding to other aggregation-prone proteins. In the lens, αA and αB crystallins exist as heteroaggregates of approximately 800 kDa. Both the recombinant αA and αB crystallins exist as high molecular mass oligomeric proteins of approximately 640 and 620 kDa, respectively (26.Sun T.X. Das B.K. Liang J.J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6220-6225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The size of these proteins can vary a little depending on the pH and ionic strength, and they differ in their structure, function, tissue expression, and abnormal deposition in disease. αB crystallin has a heat shock element upstream to the gene and is induced during stress (3.Klemenz R. Fröhli E. Steiger R.H. Schäfer R. Aoyama A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3652-3656Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 28.Bennardini F. Wrzosek A. Chiesi M. Circ. Res. 1992; 71: 288-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Apart from maintaining lens transparency, its in vivo functions include interaction with intermediate filaments (29.Djabali K. de Néchaud B. Landon F. Portier M. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2759-2769Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and regulation of cytomorphological rearrangements during development (30.Scotting P. McDermott H. Mayer R.J. FEBS Lett. 1991; 285: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). αB crystallin is hyperexpressed in neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's' disease, Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease, and Parkinson's disease (31.Renkawek K. Voorter C.E.M. Bosman G.J.C.G.M. van Workum F.P.A. de Jong W.W. Acta Neuropathol. 1994; 87: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 32.Renkawek K. de Jong W.W. Merck K.B. Frenken C.W.G.M.

Neuroreport. 1999; 10: 2273-2276Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The charged C-terminal domain is conserved in all the members of the small heat shock protein family, whereas the hydrophobic N-terminal domain is variable in length and sequence similarity (34.De Jong W.W. Leunissen J.A.M. Voorter C.E. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1993; 10: 103-126PubMed Google Scholar). The N- and C-terminal domains are thought to form two structural domains with an exposed C-terminal extension (35.Wistow G. FEBS Lett. 1985; 181: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of the N-terminal domains in the differential structural and functional properties of human αA and αB crystallins, we have swapped their N-terminal domains coded by exon 1. A unique XmnI restriction site at the beginning of the α-crystallin domain in a 20-nucleotide stretch in exon 2, with 100% sequence identity in human αA and αB crystallin genes, has been used to create chimeric proteins αANBC and αBNAC. We have used biophysical methods to study the structural and functional properties of wild-type αA and αB crystallins as well as the chimeras in order to get an insight into the effect of swapping and the role of the N-terminal domain in oligomerization and chaperone-like activity. The 235-base pair NdeI-XmnI fragment of pCR2.1-αA plasmid (16.Kumar L.V.S. Ramakrishna T. Rao C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24137-24141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) was ligated to the 384-base pair XmnI-HindIII fragment of pCR2.1-αB plasmid (16.Kumar L.V.S. Ramakrishna T. Rao C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24137-24141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) to generate chimeric coding region of αANBC. The αANBC chimera withNdeI-HindIII overhangs was then ligated toNdeI-HindIII-linearized expression vector pET21a (Novagen) to produce pET21a-αANBC. The 247-base pair NdeI-XmnI fragment of pCR2.1-αB was ligated to the 446-base pair XmnI-HindIII fragment of pCR2.1-αA to generate the chimeric coding region of αBNAC. The αBNAC chimera withNdeI-HindIII overhangs was ligated toNdeI-HindIII-linearized pET21a to produce pET21a-αBNAC. Sequencing was done with T7 promoter primer using the dye terminator cycle sequencing kit (Perkin-Elmer) in an 3700 ABI automated DNA sequencer. The coding regions of both the αANBC and αBNAC chimeras were found to be mutationless with no change in the reading frame. The expression plasmids (pET21a-αAwt, pET21a-αBwt, pET21a-αANBC, and pET21a-αBNAC) were transformed into competentEscherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells. Growth, induction, lysis of cells, and purification of chimeric proteins was done as described for recombinant wild-type αA and αB crystallins (26.Sun T.X. Das B.K. Liang J.J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6220-6225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Multimeric sizes of the wild-type and chimeric proteins were evaluated on Superose-6 HR 10/30 prepacked column (dimensions: 10 × 300 mm, bed volume: 24 ml) with reference to high molecular mass standards (Sigma). Standards used were thyroglobulin (669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), and catalase (232 kDa). Intrinsic fluorescence spectra of wild-type and chimeric proteins were recorded using a Hitachi F-4000 fluorescence spectrophotometer with the excitation wavelength of 295 nm. The excitation and emission band passes were set at 5 and 3 nm, respectively. Intrinsic fluorescence spectra were recorded using 0.2 mg/ml protein in 10 mm phosphate buffer, which was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. Wild-type and chimeric proteins (0.2 mg/ml) in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 100 mmNaCl were equilibrated at 37 °C in the sample holder of Hitachi F-4000 fluorescence spectrophotometer using a Julabo thermostated water bath for 10 min. To these protein samples, 20 μl of 10 mmANS was added. Fluorescence spectra were recorded with an excitation wavelength of 365 nm. The excitation and emission band passes were 5 and 3 nm, respectively. Circular dichroism spectra were recorded using a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter. All spectra reported are the average of 5 accumulations. Far- and near-UV CD spectra were recorded using 0.05- and 1-cm pathlength cuvettes, respectively. Chaperone-like activity of the wild-type and chimeric proteins was studied by the insulin aggregation assay (6.Raman B. Ramakrishna T. Rao C.M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 365: 133-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 36.Farahbakhsh Z.T. Huang Q.L. Ding L.L. Altenbach C. Steinhoff H.J. Horwitz J. Hubell W.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 509-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The extent of protection by the wild-type αA and αB crystallins and the chimeric proteins was studied by incubating insulin (0.2 mg/ml) with various concentrations of the wild-type and chimeric proteins for 10 min at 37 °C. Aggregation was initiated by the addition of 20 μl of 1m dithiothreitol (DTT) after the incubation. Human αA and αB crystallin genes have a unique site for the restriction enzyme XmnI at the beginning of exon 2. A 20 nucleotide stretch at the XmnI site in both αA and αB crystallins has 100% sequence identity. Swapping of the domains does not disturb the reading frame (Fig. 1). Since XmnI site is slightly into the exon II, the excised N-terminal fragment has additional 15 amino acids. Of the 15 amino acids, 8 are identical and the rest are chemically conserved. Ligation of the N-terminal domain of αA crystallin with the C-terminal region of αB crystallin results in the chimeric polypeptide αANBC crystallin, which is 171 amino acids long. Similarly, the ligation of the N-terminal region of αB crystallin with C-terminal domain of αA crystallin creates polypeptide αBNAC crystallin that is 177 amino acids long. Henceforth, the chimeras are referred to as αANBC and αBNAC. Overexpression and purification of the chimeric proteins was carried out as described earlier for the wild-type proteins. The wild-type and chimeric proteins were purified to greater than 95% homogeneity, as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (data not shown), and moved as ∼20-kDa proteins as expected. Interestingly, when αANBC is eluted from a Mono Q ion exchange column with a 0–2m NaCl gradient, it elutes at ∼100 mm NaCl like the wild-type αB crystallin. On the other hand, αBNAC elutes at ∼350 mm NaCl, similar to wild-type αA crystallin. The number of positively and negatively charged amino acids are identical in wild-type αA crystallin and αBNAC (Arg+Lys = 20; Asp+Glu = 25) and in wild-type αB crystallin and αANBC (Arg+Lys = 24; Asp+Glu = 25). A recently proposed model for α-crystallin suggests that the hydrophobic N-terminal domain is mostly buried in the oligomer (37.Smulders R.H.P.H. van Boekel M.A.M. de Jong W.W. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1998; 22: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Thus, the C-terminal domain may largely determine the surface charge distribution of the proteins. This could be one of the reasons for the similarity in Mono Q elution profiles of wild-type proteins and chimeras that contain C-terminal regions identical to those of the wild-type proteins. To investigate the consequences of domain swapping on the molecular masses, chimeric and wild-type proteins were chromatographed on a FPLC Superose-6 gel filtration column (Fig. 2). The average molecular masses of wild-type αA and αB crystallins were observed to be ∼640 and ∼620 kDa, respectively. These sizes are consistent with earlier reports (16.Kumar L.V.S. Ramakrishna T. Rao C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24137-24141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 26.Sun T.X. Das B.K. Liang J.J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6220-6225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The chimera αANBC elutes at the same elution volume as that of wild-type αB with an apparent molecular mass of ∼620 kDa. However the αBNAC chimera oligomerizes into large polydisperse aggregates, with species exceeding 2000 kDa. This finding shows an important difference in αA and αB crystallins. The αANBC chimera consisting of the N-terminal domain of αA crystallin and the C-terminal domain of αB crystallin still possesses the oligomer size of wild-type αA and αB crystallins. Thus, it appears that the N-terminal domain of αB crystallin can be replaced by the N-terminal domain of αA crystallin with no alteration in the oligomeric status. However, the N-terminal domain of αB crystallin in fusion with the C-terminal domain of αA crystallin forms very large aggregates, probably due to altered packing of the subunits with an increase in intersubunit interaction. This kind of increase in the oligomer size was earlier observed in the R116C mutant of αA crystallin (15.Bova M.P. Yaron O. Huang O. Haley D.A. Stewart P.L. Horwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6137-6142Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The monomer sizes of the proteins of the small heat shock protein family range from 12 to 43 kDa. Almost all members of this family multimerize to form large aggregates, ranging in size from 400 to 800 kDa with only one exception till date; sHSP 12.6 of Caenorhabditis elegans, which has the shortest N- and C-terminal domains, is monomeric (38.Leroux M.R. Melki R. Gordon B. Batelier G. Candido E.P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24646-24656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain is variable in both length and sequence in the sHSP superfamily, which might be responsible for the varying multimeric sizes. Bova et al. (27.Bova M.P. Mchaourab H.S. Fung B.K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1035-1042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) showed that sequential truncation from the N terminus of αA crystallin reduces oligomeric size. In the present study, the sequence length of the swapped N-terminal domain between αA and αB crystallin is similar, so the variation in sequence of this domain is likely to be responsible for the differential multimerization of the chimeric proteins. The emission maximum of tryptophan is highly sensitive to solvent polarity and depends on the accessibility of tryptophan residues to the aqueous phase. Fig.3 shows the intrinsic fluorescence spectra of wild-type and chimeric proteins. The intrinsic fluorescence spectra of the wild-type αB crystallin and αBNAC are similar. Both the tryptophans are present in the N-terminal domain, which are likely to be in a similar environment even after domain swapping. A slight blue shift, noticeable in the red region of the emission profile of αBNAC, compared with the wild-type αB crystallin suggests that the tryptophans in the chimera are marginally less solvent accessible. The intrinsic fluorescence spectra of the lone tryptophan of wild-type αA crystallin, which is present in the N-terminal domain, and αANBC are similar, indicating no alteration of the tryptophan environment in the chimeric αANBC protein with respect to the wild-type αA crystallin. Fig. 4 shows the spectra of ANS in the presence of wild-type and chimeric proteins. ANS fluorescence spectra show marked differences in emission intensity with no apparent change in emission maxima. The αANBC chimera binds the least amount of ANS among all the proteins compared. The αBNAC chimera, on the other hand, binds ANS several times more when compared with wild-type αB crystallin, wild-type αA crystallin, and αANBC chimera. This finding suggests that there are more hydrophobic regions accessible to ANS in the αBNAC chimera than in αANBC chimera. The molecular basis for this finding is not yet clear. However, the gel permeation chromatography data together with ANS fluorescence suggest that αBNAC might be forming a large porous oligomer.Figure 4The normalized fluorescence emission spectrum of ANS bound to wild-type αA crystallin (○), wild-type αB crystallin (●), αANBC (▵), and αBNAC (▴).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fig. 5 shows far-UV circular dichroism spectra of wild-type and chimeric proteins. CD spectra of wild-type αA and αB crystallins, shown inpanel A, are comparable with the CD spectra of recombinant human αA and αB crystallins reported earlier (15.Bova M.P. Yaron O. Huang O.

Chimeric proteins also show β-sheet CD profiles. The CD spectrum of αANBC is comparable to the spectra of wild-type αA and αB crystallins. However, αBNAC shows increased ellipticity. Near-UV CD spectra (Fig. 6) also show a similar trend. Spectra of wild-type αA and αB are comparable to earlier reported spectra for recombinant human αA and αB crystallins (15.Bova M.P. Yaron O. Huang O. Haley D.A. Stewart P.L. Horwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6137-6142Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The CD spectrum of the chimeric αANBC is comparable to that of αB crystallin with increased chirality for αANBC. The CD spectrum of αBNAC on the other hand is comparable to that of wild-type αA crystallin. Domain swapping results in some change in secondary and tertiary structure of αANBC with observable change only in the secondary structure for αBNAC. Insulin B-chain aggregates in the presence of DTT. At 37 °C a 1:1 (w/w) ratio of wild-type αA and αB crystallin to insulin prevented this aggregation completely. At ratios of 1:2 and 1:4, aggregation was prevented to lesser extents, as shown in Fig. 7 (panels A and B). Interestingly, the chimera αBNAC showed enhanced chaperone-like activity. The initial scatter value for αBNAC chimera without insulin was very high. The large molecular size of αBNAC could be responsible for the high scatter. We had earlier observed a similar high initial scatter value for the R116C mutant of αA crystallin, which also forms a large aggregate (>2000 kDa) (16.Kumar L.V.S. Ramakrishna T. Rao C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24137-24141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The data were normalized to determine the protective ability of the αBNAC protein. At 37 °C complete protection was observed at a 1:6 w/w ratio of αBNAC to insulin. Significant protection was observed even at 1:8, 1:12, and 1:16 ratios of αBNAC to insulin (Fig.7 D). The αBNAC chimera shows 3–4-fold increase in the chaperone-like activity compared with the wild-type proteins. αANBC, in contrast, shows complete loss of chaperone-like activity. A 1:2 (w/w) ratio of αANBC to insulin does not show any protective ability toward DTT-induced aggregation of insulin. Increasing the αANBC ratios to 1:1 and 2:1 w/w with respect to insulin does not show any increase in protection (Fig. 7 C). In fact, αANBC promotes the aggregation process as observed by increased light scattering. The swapped N-terminal domain (exon 1 encoded) is comparable in length between human αA and αB crystallins. There are some differences in the sequences in this region. One of the prominent differences is the increase in the number of proline residues. The N-terminal domain of αA crystallin contains 5 proline residues, whereas the same region for αB crystallin has 9 proline residues (two prolines in tandem). The swapping alters the number of proline residues in the chimeric proteins. αBNAC contains 9 prolines in its N-terminal domain, a gain of 4 prolines in comparison to the same region of wild-type αA crystallin. Far-UV CD spectrum shows some enhancement in the secondary structure. Whether the local secondary structural changes can alter the subunit topology and consequently intersubunit interactions remains to be investigated. Although we point out differences in the number of proline residues, there are other sequence variations, and marginal changes in predicted pI and the total length of the chimeric proteins. Clearly discernible changes are oligomeric status, accessible hydrophobic surfaces, and chaperone-like activity. It is interesting to note that, despite being similar to wild-type αB crystallin in the aggregate molecular mass and circular dichroism spectra, the chimeric αANBC possesses no chaperone-like activity. The most important difference between the two chimeric proteins is the accessible hydrophobicity. ANS, a hydrophobicity probe, very clearly distinguishes the two chimeric proteins. We believe that the lack of accessible surface hydrophobicity, probably due to altered subunit packing in αANBC chimera, results in its loss of chaperone-like activity. The enhanced chaperone-like activity of αBNAC chimera could be because of the exposure and availability of more hydrophobic surfaces when compared with the wild-type proteins. Increased ANS binding of the αBNAC chimera supports this possibility. We observed an increase in oligomeric size and chaperone-like activity in the case of the αBNAC chimera. However, the increase in size and enhancement of chaperone-like activity may not be necessarily correlated. The point mutation R116C in αA crystallin leads to increased oligomer size but results in significant loss of chaperone-like activity. Swapping the N-terminal domain between human αA and αB crystallins makes a more effective chaperone in the case of αBNAC chimera, whereas αANBC chimera loses its protective abilities completely. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report where a 3–4-fold increase in chaperone-like activity is observed. This phenomenon may have a therapeutic significance in diseases occurring due to protein misfolding. We thank Dr. T. Ramakrishna for critical reading of the manuscript and Shradha Goenka for useful discussions."
https://openalex.org/W2089554403,"The dose-response curve of steroid hormones and the associated EC50 value are critical parameters both in the development of new pharmacologically active compounds and in the endocrine therapy of various disease states. We have recently described three different variables that can reposition the dose-response curve of agonist-bound glucocorticoid receptors (GRs): a 21-base pair sequence of the rat tyrosine aminotransferase gene called a glucocorticoid modulatory element (GME), GR concentration, and coactivator concentration. At the same time, each of these three components was found to influence the partial agonist activity of antiglucocorticoids. In an effort to determine whether these three processes proceed via independent pathways or a common intermediate, we have examined several mechanistic details. The effects of increasing concentrations of both GR and the coactivator TIF2 are found to be saturable. Furthermore, saturating levels of either GR or TIF2 inhibit the ability of each protein, and the GME, to affect further changes in the dose-response curve or partial agonist activity of antisteroids. This competitive inhibition suggests that all three modulators proceed through a common step involving a titratable factor. Support for this hypothesis comes from the observation that a fragment of the coactivator TIF2 retaining intrinsic transactivation activity is a dominant negative inhibitor of each component (GME, GR, and coactivator). This inhibition was not due to nonspecific effects on the general transcription machinery as the VP16 transactivation domain was inactive. The viral protein E1A also prevented the action of each of the three components in a manner that was independent of E1A's ability to block the histone acetyltransferase activity of CBP. Collectively, these results suggest that three different inputs (GME, GR, and coactivator) for perturbing the dose-response curve, and partial agonist activity, of GR-steroid complexes act by converging at a single step that involves a limiting factor prior to transcription initiation.

In the most frequently studied situations, these rates are increased following the binding of agonist steroids to their cognate receptors. Antisteroids block the action of agonist steroids but generally retain some residual agonist activity. For both classes of receptor-steroid complexes, the binding of steroid to its cognate receptor is thought to be the rate-limiting step in steroid hormone action (1Baxter J.D. Tomkins G.M. Proc. Natl.

Both the responses to endogenous steroids and the pharmacology of steroid hormone-based endocrine therapies depend critically on the dose-response curve, which relates steroid concentration to biological activity. Depending on where the curve is positioned, more or less steroid will be required to achieve half of the maximal desired response, or the EC50. A lower EC50, which is synonymous with a left-shifted dose-response curve, is highly desirable in clinical situations as it leads to fewer adverse side effects. This is because the responses of other regulated genes with higher EC50 values would be greatly reduced at the lower steroid concentrations. Similarly, antisteroids that are selective receptor modulators, which are antagonists for designated genes but agonists for all other responsive genes, would be most useful in antisteroid therapies. Over the last several years, numerous examples have been reported of genes with different EC50 values for steroidal agonists and partial agonist activity for antisteroids (17Amara J.F. Itallie C.V.

The current models for steroid hormone action do not help in understanding these phenomena as they predict that the same receptor-agonist complex will evoke identical dose-response curves (and EC50 values) for all responsive genes. Likewise, a specific antisteroid should always produce the same amount of partial agonist activity. These invariant predictions suggest that additional components or processes may be needed to account for the above diverse transcriptional properties of individual steroid receptor-steroid complexes. Three components/processes have recently been identified that can modulate both the dose-response curves of agonists and the partial agonist activity of antagonists bound to glucocorticoid receptors (GRs). The first to be described was the glucocorticoid modulatory element (GME), which was identified as being 1 kilobase pair upstream of the glucocorticoid response elements (GREs) of the rat tyrosine aminotransferase gene (28Oshima H. Simons Jr., S.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 416-428PubMed Google Scholar, 36Oshima H. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26858-26865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Collier C.D.

At the same time, these cofactors each increased the partial agonist activity of antiglucocorticoids, such as dexamethasone 21-mesylate, without increasing the concentration of GR (23Szapary D. Huang Y. Simons Jr., S.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 2108-2121Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Conversely, added corepressor SMRT antagonized the actions of added coactivator. The transcriptional responses to the three components (GME, GR, or coactivator) in our previous studies were qualitatively identical (22Szapary D. Xu M. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol.

In every case, the induction properties of all agonists and antagonists examined were similarly modified. We also never observed any dissociation of the effects on the dose-response curve from those on the partial agonist activity of antagonists. Furthermore, the changes in these induction parameters were independent of changes in total transactivation or -fold induction (22Szapary D. Xu M. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol.

This coincidence of phenotypical properties suggested that each process might modify the GR induction properties via a common step that could involve a titratable factor. Among the various components that we have examined, TIF2 and the GME binding proteins (GMEB-1 and -2) were particularly interesting because they were all devoid of HAT activity (35Kaul S. Blackford Jr., J.A. Chen J. Ogryzko V.V. Simons Jr., S.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1010-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 48Voegel J.J. Heine M.J.S. Tini M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. EMBO. 1998; 17: 507-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Therefore, to the extent that HAT activity is involved in the actions of these components, it would have to be present in some other protein in the transactivation complex. A ubiquitous recruited component of steroid hormone action is CBP, which does possess HAT activity (4Ogryzko V.V. Schiltz R.L. Russanova V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1996; 87: 953-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2355) Google Scholar). CBP is known to bind TIF2 (48Voegel J.J. Heine M.J.S. Tini M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. EMBO. 1998; 17: 507-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar) and interacts with both GMEBs in mammalian two-hybrid assays (35Kaul S. Blackford Jr., J.A. Chen J. Ogryzko V.V. Simons Jr., S.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1010-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). For these reasons, a specific inhibitor of CBP HAT activity would be a useful mechanistic probe. The adenovirus protein E1A, which occurs as both 12 S and 13 S isoforms, appears to be ideal for several reasons. E1A interacts with numerous molecules, including CBP and p300, with diverse consequences (49Flint J. Shenk T. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1997; 31: 177-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). E1A-13S can both increase and repress the activation of various genes. However, repression correlates with the ability of E1A to bind CBP/p300 (49Flint J. Shenk T. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1997; 31: 177-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). E1A-13S has also been reported to inhibit estrogen receptor activation (50Smith C.L. Onate S.A. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8884-8888Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), possibly by inhibiting the HAT activity of CBP (51Chakravarti D. Ogryzko V. Kao H.-Y. Nash A. Chen H. Nakatani Y. Evans R.M. Cell. 1999; 96: 393-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Hormone-induced transactivation and histone acetylation by estrogen receptor are reported to be highly dependent on the HAT function of CBP/p300 (52Chen H. Lin R.J. Xie W. Wilpitz D. Evans R.M. Cell. 1999; 98: 675-686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar), whereas E1A-12S (full length = 1–242) inhibits acetylation of histones by CBP (53Perissi V. Dasen J.S. Kurokawa R. Wang Z. Korzus E. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3652-3657Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In contrast, Li et al. (54Li Q. Imhof A. Collingwood T.N. Urnov F.D. Wolffe A.P. EMBO. 1999; 18: 5634-5652Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) described that an N-terminal deletion of E1A has no direct effect on the induction of transcriptional activation by retinoid X receptor/TR complexes but rather stimulates transcription at a subsequent step by acetylating proteins associated with the Xenopus TRβA promoter. Thus, E1A should be an interesting probe of the mechanism by which TIF2, GME, and increased GR modulate GR induction properties. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the effects on GR transactivation properties of the GME and increased concentrations of GR or coactivators, such as TIF2, proceed through distinct or common pathways. The ability of these components to modulate GR transcriptional properties was examined by the kinetic method of determining if one or more of the various components could competitively inhibit the actions of each other. Additional evidence for action by a common intermediate was sought by investigating whether inhibitors of one process would be equally effective in blocking the other processes. One of the inhibitors used, for the reasons outlined above, was the 13 S form of E1A, which blocks the HAT activity of CBP (51Chakravarti D. Ogryzko V. Kao H.-Y. Nash A. Chen H. Nakatani Y. Evans R.M. Cell. 1999; 96: 393-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Our studies suggest that multiple pathways can converge to modify GR induction properties in a manner that does not require the HAT activity of CBP. Unless otherwise indicated, all operations were performed at 0°C. Dexamethasone was purchased from Sigma. Dexamethasone 21-mesylate was synthesized as described (55Simons Jr., S.S. Pons M. Johnson D.F. J. Org.

GAL/VP16 (pm3VP16) and (UAS)5tkLuc were purchased fromCLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA).

Chem. 1991; 266: 22075-22078Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have been described previously. CV-1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS; Biofluids Inc., Rockville, MD) at 37°C in a humidified incubator (5% CO2). The transient transfections were performed using calcium phosphate in presence of DMEM plus 10% FCS followed by a 16-h incubation in DMEM plus 10% FCS before being induced with the appropriate steroid for 24 h (22Szapary D. Xu M. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30576-30582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were lysed and assayed for reporter gene activity using luciferase assay reagent according to manufacturer's instruction (Promega, Madison, WI.). Luciferase activity was measured in an EG&G Berthhold luminometer (Microlumat LB 96 P). All statistical analyses were, unless specified otherwise, by the two-tailed Student's t test using the program InStat 2.03 for Macintosh (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). The presence of increasing concentrations of GR in transiently transfected cells causes an increase in the -fold induction at each concentration of steroid (Fig. 1 A). The effect of added GR on the dose-response curve is most easily appreciated when all of the data are replotted as percentage of maximal induction by a saturating concentration of dexamethasone (1 μm). When this is done, it is clear that there is a marked shift in the dose-response curve (and EC50) to lower steroid concentrations (Fig. 1 B). We have previously reported similar effects of added GR (22Szapary D. Xu M. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30576-30582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), GME (36Oshima H. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26858-26865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and TIF2 (23Szapary D. Huang Y. Simons Jr., S.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 2108-2121Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) without changing the shape of the curve. To facilitate similar types of measurements under numerous conditions, we commonly use an abbreviated assay in which the activity of a constant, subsaturating concentration of the agonist dexamethasone is expressed as percent of the maximal activity displayed by saturating concentrations of dexamethasone (1 μm). In this assay, an increase in the percentage of maximal agonist activity seen with a subsaturating concentration of dexamethasone (such as 0.4 nm, indicated by dashed vertical line in Fig.1 B) is diagnostic of a shift in the dose-response curve to the left (22Szapary D. Xu M. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30576-30582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 23Szapary D. Huang Y. Simons Jr., S.S. Mol.

Plisov S.Y. Simons Jr., S.S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2000; 162: 221-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). At the same time, this abbreviated assay includes a single point with a saturating concentration of antisteroid so that we can simultaneously determine the effect of the specific reaction conditions on the partial agonist activity of an antiglucocorticoid. Typical transient transfections with CV-1 cells utilize 0.04–0.4 μg of GR plasmid (Fig. 1) (22Szapary D. Xu M. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30576-30582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 23Szapary D. Huang Y. Simons Jr., S.S. Mol.

Biol. 1999; 68: 89-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Concentrations of the plasmid pSVLGR as high as 4 μg can be used without signs of squelching, as determined by both the total amount of transactivation and the -fold induction by 1 μm dexamethasone (data not shown). However, the ability of increasing GR plasmid to cause a progressively greater percentage of maximal activity with subsaturating concentrations of dexamethasone (synonymous with further left shifts in the dexamethasone dose-response curve), and higher amounts of partial agonist activity of progesterone, reaches a plateau by 2 μg of pSVLGR (Fig. 2 A). This suggests that the effects of added GR have a finite limit, consistent with the titration of an intermediate factor or saturation of a step in the transcriptional activation process. The classical method for establishing that two processes share a common intermediate is to show that they exhibit competitive inhibition, wherein saturating concentrations of one component prevent the action of a second component (58Mahler H.R. Cordes E.H. Biologial Chemistry. Harper and Row, New York1966: 250Google Scholar). We therefore asked whether the GME can augment the action of both low and plateau concentrations of GR. If the presence of the GME is able to cause increased activity at low but not high concentrations of GR, one can conclude that the two processes compete at a common reaction step that is already maximally stimulated at high levels of GR. The sensitivity of such assays is greatly diminished near saturation of the dose-response curve, where increasing amounts of steroid have progressively smaller effects (see Fig. 1). Therefore, we concentrated on the changes in the percent of maximal induction at low levels of dexamethasone so that we would still be in the sensitive part of the dose-response curve (≤50% of maximal induction) with plateau concentrations of GR. As expected from previous results, the presence of the GME increases the various relative activities seen with low concentrations of GR (Fig. 2 A; p ≤ 0.0022 for treatments with 0.1 ng of GR ± GME) (28Oshima H. Simons Jr., S.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 416-428PubMed Google Scholar, 36Oshima H. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26858-26865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Collier C.D.

Biol. 1998; 66: 79-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). However, the GME is completely inactive at high concentrations of GR. We, therefore, conclude that the actions of the GME and GR competitively inhibit each other and proceed through a shared step. The absence of any increase in the percent of maximal activity at high concentrations of GR ± GME for low concentrations of dexamethasone does not appear to be due to a saturation of the transcriptional"

Cyclin D3 messenger RNA (CcnD3 mRNA) stability decreases rapidly when murine T lymphoma cells are treated with the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone. Basal stability of CcnD3 mRNA is regulated by sequences within the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR). RNA-protein interactions occurring within the CcnD3 3′-UTR have been analyzed by RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Three sites of RNA-protein interaction have been mapped using this approach. These elements include three pyrimidine-rich domains of 25, 26, and 37 nucleotides. When the cyclin D3 3′-UTR was stably overexpressed, the endogenous CcnD3 mRNA was no longer regulated by dexamethasone. Likewise, overexpression of a 215-nucleotide transgene that contains the 26- and 37-nucleotide elements blocks glucocorticoid inhibition of CcnD3 mRNA expression. These observations suggest that the 215-nucleotide 3′-UTR element may act as a molecular decoy, competing for proteins that bind to the endogenous transcript and thereby attenuating glucocorticoid responsiveness. UV-cross-linking experiments showed that two proteins of approximate molecular weight 37,000 and 52,000 bind to this 3′-UTR element.

Allergy Immunol. 1994; 105: 347-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), and glucocorticoids are an important tool for treatment of leukemias and other malignant and nonmalignant lymphoproliferative diseases. Glucocorticoids have also been proposed to be responsible for triggering apoptosis of CD4+/CD8+ cells in the thymus (reviewed in Ref. 3.Cohen J.J. Semin. Immunol. 1992; 4: 363-369PubMed Google Scholar). We have analyzed glucocorticoid effects on murine T lymphoma P1798 cells in an attempt to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that account for glucocorticoid inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of cell death. The data indicate that glucocorticoids induce G0/G1arrest by decreasing the expression of two critical cell G1progression factors: c-Myc (4.Forsthoefel A.M. Thompson E.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1987; 12: 899-907Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and cyclin D3 (5.Reisman D. Thompson E.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1500-1509PubMed Google Scholar). P1798 cells utilize cyclin D3 as the principal D-type cyclin in G1/S phase transition (6.Ajchenbaum F. Ando K. De Caprio J.A. Griffin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4113-4119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cyclin D2 is barely detectable and cyclin D1 is undetectable in P1798 cells (5.Reisman D. Thompson E.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1500-1509PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, inhibition of cyclin D3 blocks activation of Cdk4/Cdk6 and precludes progression through G1 phase (5.Reisman D. Thompson E.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1500-1509PubMed Google Scholar). Simultaneous overexpression of c-Myc plus cyclin D3 prevents cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of glucocorticoid-treated cells, although neither c-Myc nor cyclin D3 alone will suffice to protect cells (7.Rhee K. Bresnahan W. Hirai M. Thompson E.A. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4188-4195PubMed Google Scholar). Glucocorticoids control cyclin D3 expression in T-lymphoid cells by decreasing the stability of CcnD3 mRNA (5.Reisman D. Thompson E.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1500-1509PubMed Google Scholar). CcnD3 mRNA is quite stable in mid-log phase P1798 cells, as determined by measuring mRNA abundance after treatment with actinomycin D. However, the rate of degradation of CcnD3 mRNA increases within 2 h after addition of glucocorticoids, to the extent that a 50% decrease in mRNA abundance occurs within 60–90 min after addition of actinomycin D to glucocorticoid-treated cells (5.Reisman D. Thompson E.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1500-1509PubMed Google Scholar). This posttranscriptional mechanism of gene expression, coupled with the short half-life of the cyclin D3 protein, ensures a rapid response to glucocorticoids. There are several examples of glucocorticoid effects on mRNA stability (8.Petersen D.D. Koch S.R. Granner D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7800-7804Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 9.Gadson Jr., P. McCoy J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1173: 22-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 10.Peppel K. Vinci J.M.

During the last decade, several RNA motifs have been identified that control the degradation rate of specific mRNAs. Iron-responsive elements (reviewed in Ref. 11.Hentze M.W. Kuhn L.C. Proc. Natl.

Several families of RNA-binding proteins have been implicated in controlling the stability of mRNAs. The heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP)1 complexes involved in maturation of mRNAs contain more than 20 protein species, many of which are involved in mRNA stability control (17.Matunis M.J. Michael W.M. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 164-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 18.Zaidi S.H.E. Malter J.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 20511-20516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Regulation of replication-dependent histone mRNAs involves specific RNA-protein interactions within the 3′-UTR. Processing and degradation of those mRNAs are mediated by a 26-base stem-loop structure and a M r 31,000 protein (23.Wang Z.F. Whitfield M.L. Ingledue III, T.C. Diminski Z. Marzluff W.F. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 3028-3040Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The general conclusions that one may advance are that 1) mRNA stability is frequently determined by RNA-protein interactions, and 2) those interactions frequently occur within the 3′-UTR. The experiments described in this paper were designed to test the hypothesis that the 3′-UTR of CcnD3 mRNA contains specific protein-binding elements that are involved in glucocorticoid regulation of degradation of the mature transcript. We have undertaken to analyze RNA-protein interactions within the 3′-UTR, to map the nucleotide components that are required for such interactions, and to characterize the RNA-binding proteins with which these elements interact. Our results indicate that there is a protein-binding element within the 3′-UTR of CcnD3 mRNA. This element interacts with at least two proteins, and this interaction is necessary for glucocorticoid-mediated destabilization of CcnD3 mRNA. Murine T-lymphoma P1798-S20 cells were maintained in suspension culture in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 3 mm glutamine, 25 mm HEPES, 20 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 2% fetal bovine serum, at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Mid-log phase cultures containing 5–8 × 105 cell/ml were used for all experiments. Dexamethasone was dissolved in 70% ethanol as a 0.1 mm stock, and this was diluted into medium to a final concentration of 0.1 μm dexamethasone and 0.07% ethanol in all experiments. Ethanol has no effect on P1798 cultures at this concentration. RNA isolation was performed using TRIzol reagent from Life Technologies Inc. Northern blotting was carried out under standard conditions, and all Northern blotting data were normalized to 18 S RNA. Autoradiographic data were quantified using a Lynx 5000 digital workstation. Cytosolic protein extracts were prepared using the method described by Sun and Antony (24.Sun X.L. Antony A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25539-25547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were washed with 5 packed cell volumes of phosphate-buffered saline by centrifugation at 2000 rpm in a Beckman JA-14 rotor at 4 °C. Cells (5 × 107) were incubated at 4 °C in Buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, containing 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) for 10 min at a ratio of 5 ml of Buffer A per ml of packed cell volume. The cells were centrifuged (5 min at 2000 rpm in a Beckman JA-14 rotor), suspended in 2 ml of Buffer A per ml of packed cells, and then lysed by 10 strokes of a glass Dounce homogenizer (B pestle). Cell lysis was confirmed by microscopy. The lysate was centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The resultant supernatant fraction was mixed with 0.11 supernatant volumes of Buffer B (300 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, containing 10 mm MgCl2, 1.4M KCl), and this solution was centrifuged for 60 min at 100,000 × g. The supernatant fraction was recovered and dialyzed for 8 h against 20 volumes of Buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, containing 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mmdithiothreitol). Aliquots (100 μl) were frozen at –80 °C, and once thawed, they were never reused. The MAXIscript kit from AMBION Inc. was used for the synthesis of cyclin D3 3′-UTR probes. [α-32P]CTP (800Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products, Inc.) was used to label the probes. The full-length 3′-UTR of murine CcnD3 mRNA from nucleotide 933 to 1871 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into InVitrogen pCRII to yield pCRII/D3UTR. This plasmid was digested with BamHI, and run-off transcription was performed from the T7 promoter to generate the D3 3′-UTR probe (specific activity 217.8Ci/μm). Nucleotides 933–1574 of the cyclin D3 cDNA were eliminated by digesting pCRII/D3UTR with StuI and EcoRV and ligating the blunt ends to generate a plasmid named pCRII/D3UTRΔ1–1574. pCRII/D3UTRΔ1–1574 was digested with AvrII (which cuts at 1789), and run-off transcription was performed with T7 RNA polymerase to yield a probe corresponding to nucleotides 1575–1789. This probe was named BC (specific activity, 54.4Ci/μm). The probes were purified by electrophoresis in 8 m urea on 5% polyacrylamide gels. RNA-protein binding reactions and electrophoresis of the complexes formed were carried out using a variation of the method described by Leibold and Munro (25.Leibold E.A. Munro H.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 85: 2171-2175Crossref Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Binding reactions were carried out with various amounts of cytosolic extract and 15 pg of 32P-labeled RNA probe in 30 μl of Buffer D (containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 3 mmMgCl2, 40 mm KCl, 2% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 mg/ml heparin). Cytosolic protein extracts were diluted in Buffer C (described above) to equalize the volumes among different reactions in each experiment. Reactions performed with the CcnD3 3′-UTR probe were incubated for 20 min at 30 °C, and then 20 units of ribonuclease T1 were added and the reaction was incubated for another 20 min at 30 °C. Under these conditions, the ribonuclease T1 digestion is incomplete. In one experiment, proteinase K was added to a final concentration of 2 mg/ml for 20 min at 30 °C. Reactions performed with the BC probe (1575–1789) were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C and contained 3.3 ng/μl of yeast tRNA as a nonspecific competitor, and there was no ribonuclease T1 digestion of the BC-protein complex prior to electrophoresis. Binding conditions were otherwise identical to those described for the full-length 3′-UTR. In competition experiments, labeled probe was mixed with the unlabeled probes before addition of the cytosolic extracts. Electrophoresis of RNA-protein complexes was carried out in 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels. Autoradiography was performed at –80 °C. RNA-protein complexes were resolved by electrophoretic mobility shift. These complexes were excised from polyacrylamide gels, and the labeled RNA was isolated by phenol-chloroform extraction. The isolated RNA fragments were digested in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm EDTA and 20 units of ribonuclease T1 for 60 min at 37 °C. Ribonuclease T1-resistant fingerprint fragments were separated by electrophoresis in 8 m urea and 0.1%SDS on 20% polyacrylamide gels. The method used to cross-link the BC probe to the RNA-binding proteins was performed as described by Chang et al. (26.Chang K.H. Brown E.A. Lemon S.M. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6716-6725Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. Binding reactions were carried out with various amounts of cytosolic extract and 32P-labeled RNA probe in Buffer D containing 0.1 μg/μl of yeast tRNA. After 20 min at 30 °C the samples were transferred to ice and irradiated for 30 min with a UV light source (254 nm, 15 W) at a distance of approximately 4 cm. After irradiation, RNA was digested with 1 mg/ml of ribonuclease A for 1 h at 37 °C. The UV cross-linked products were separated on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and detected by autoradiography. pUHD10–4 was constructed by replacing the polylinker of pUHD10–3 (26.Chang K.H. Brown E.A. Lemon S.M. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6716-6725Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with a multiple cloning site that contains unique SacII (442), EcoRI (449), EcoRV (457), SalI (462), AccI (463), PstI (473), BglII (475), XbaI (481), andBamHI (487) sites. Numbers in parentheses are positions relative to the XhoI site of the parental pUHD10–3.pUHD10–5 was made by replacing the polylinker of pUHD10–3 with a multiple cloning site that contains unique sites forSacII (446), NotI (446), EcoRV (455),SphI (469), AvrII (470), and PacI (480). pUHDZeo4 was made by ligating theXhoI/PvuII fragment of pZeo (InVitrogen) with theXhoI/PvuII fragment of pUHD10–4.pUHDZeo5 was made by ligating theXhoI/NaeI fragment of pUHD10–5 into theXhoI/PvuII fragment of pZeo. These pUHDZeo plasmid conveys stable resistance to the antibiotic zeocin. Modified tetracycline-repressible expression vectors and their nucleotide sequences are available upon request. The 1878-base pair EcoRI fragment containing full-length CcnD3 cDNA was cloned into pUHDZeo4 to create p4ZD3FL (full-length), which we have designated tetD3FL. p4ZD3FL was digested with XbaI to excise the 3′-UTR and then ligated to form p4ZD3D3P (Δ3′-UTR), which is designated tetD3Δ-UTR. The 215-nucleotide BC element was excised as a StuI/AvrII fragment from pCRIID3FL and cloned into theEcoRV/XbaI sites of pUHD4Zeo to form p4zBC. The p4zBC transcript has a predicted size of about 250 nucleotides and is terminated by SV40 polyadenylylation signals. Transcribed from the tetO/human cytomegalovirus major immediate early TATA box (HCMV) chimeric promoter, the p4zBC transcript is presumed to be capped. We have not been able to quantify this transcript, and we have not ascertained that the transcript is either capped or polyadenylylated. p5zβGal was made by ligating theNotI/AhaIII fragment of cytomegalovirus/βGal (Promega) into the NotI/EcoRV sites of pUHDZeo5. This expression vector is identified herein as β-gal.p5BGD3UTR was made by inserting theSpeI/XbaI fragment from pCRII/D33-UTR (containing the 3′-UTR) into the AvrII site ofp5zβGal. This transgene is called β-galD3UTR herein. P1798 cells were initially transfected to stably express the tetracycline transactivator from pUHD15–1neo (27.Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4268) Google Scholar). G418-resistant clones were screened for transient expression of pUHD13–3 (tet/luciferase). Secondary transfections with appropriate expression vectors were carried out. Some of the expression vector harbor linked zeocin resistance genes; others were co-transfected with pZeo. Stable, zeocin-resistant clones were selected and analyzed for expression of the appropriate transgenes. Cyclin D3 mRNA is very stable in P1798 cells treated with actinomycin D. As shown in Fig.1 A, there was little or no decrease in CcnD3 mRNA within the first 4 h after addition of actinomycin D to mid-log phase cells. In other experiments, we observed no decrease in CcnD3 mRNA after 24 h in the presence of actinomycin D (5.Reisman D. Thompson E.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1500-1509PubMed Google Scholar), which leads us to suspect that actinomycin D affects the turnover of CcnD3 mRNA. Data that will be presented below are consistent with this supposition. Addition of dexamethasone accelerated CcnD3 mRNA degradation, to the extent that 50% decrease in CcnD3 mRNA abundance was observed within about 2 h after addition of actinomycin D to cells that had been exposed to dexamethasone for 2 h (Fig. 1 A). These data suggest that glucocorticoids regulate the rate of degradation of CcnD3 mRNA. The great majority of mRNA stability control mechanisms reported to date have been found in the 3′-UTRs of the respective transcripts. Consequently, our first objective was to analyze the turnover of cyclin D3 mRNA derivatives with and without the 3′-UTR. Tetracycline-repressible expression systems were developed to permit analysis of mRNA abundance without resort to nonspecific inhibitors of transcription, such as actinomycin D. The development of the appropriate cell lines is described under “Materials and Methods,” and Fig. 1 B shows the results obtained upon analysis of two cell lines that stably express full-length cyclin D3 mRNA (tetD3FL) or cyclin D3 mRNA from which the 3′-UTR had been deleted (tetD3Δ-UTR). The properties of the two clonal cell lines used in these experiments are representative of at least four independently isolated clones that express either full-length or truncated D3 transgenes from the tet promoter. A ribonuclease protection assay was developed to discriminate between the transgenic tetD3 transcripts and the endogenous CcnD3 mRNA. Expression of both full-length and 3′-truncated tetD3 transcripts was repressed upon addition of tetracycline (Fig. 1 B, lanes 2 and 5), whereas expression of the endogenous CcnD3 mRNA was not affected. The cell lines illustrated in Fig. 1 B were used to measure the stability of full-length and truncated tetD3 transcripts, as shown in Fig. 1 C. The abundance of full-length tetD3 transcripts decreased 50% within about 2 h after addition of tetracycline (filled circles). In contrast, the tetD3 derivative that was deleted of the 3′-UTR exhibited a slower rate of degradation (filled squares). We estimate a T1/2 of degradation of about 12 h for the 3′-deleted transcript. These data suggest that there are elements within the 3′-UTR of cyclin D3 mRNA that control basal stability of the transcript. The rapid turnover of full-length transgenic tetD3 mRNA, (t 12 of about 2 h) is inconsistent with the data shown in Fig. 1 A, in which the abundance of endogenous CcnD3 mRNA remained relatively constant for several hours after addition of actinomycin D. These observations suggested that actinomycin D might interfere with degradation of cyclin D3 mRNA. The rate of degradation of transgenic tetD3FL mRNA was measured in cells that had been treated with actinomycin D for 2 h prior to addition of tetracycline. As shown in Fig. 1 C(diamonds), no significant decrease in the abundance of the full-length tetD3 transcript was observed within 4 h after addition of tetracycline to actinomycin d-treated cells. This apparent stability should be contrasted with the rapid rate of degradation that occurs upon addition of tetracycline to tetD3FL-expressing cultures in the absence of actinomycin D (Fig.1 C, circles). We conclude that actinomycin D has an effect on the basal stability of cyclin D3 mRNA, but this phenomenon has not been pursued. Cells that express tetD3 derivatives were treated for 24 h with dexamethasone, as shown in Fig. 1 B. Neither the full-length tetD3 transcript (lane 3) nor the 3′-truncated tetD3Δ-UTR derivative (lane 6) was regulated by glucocorticoids. The stability of both full-length and tetD3Δ-UTR transcripts was determined by measuring the abundance of the RNAs in dexamethasone-treated cells after addition of tetracycline. As shown in Fig. 1 C, dexamethasone did not affect the stability of transgenic tetD3 transcripts (open circles and open squares). This result was unanticipated, because we had previously shown that glucocorticoids do not inhibit transcription of the cyclin D3 gene (5.Reisman D. Thompson E.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1500-1509PubMed Google Scholar) and that endogenous CcnD3 mRNA is degraded more rapidly in dexamethasone-treated cells (Fig. 1 A). We were also surprised to note that dexamethasone failed to inhibit the expression of the endogenous CcnD3 mRNA in cells that were transfected with the full-length tetD3 cDNA expression vectors (Fig. 1 B, lane 3), whereas CcnD3 mRNA was inhibited when dexamethasone was added to cells that express the 3′-truncated derivative (lane 6). The data shown in Fig. 1 B suggest that overexpression of the cyclin D3 3′-UTR from a transgene (tetD3FL) interfered with glucocorticoid regulation of the endogenous CcnD3 mRNA expression. The abundance of the tetD3FL transcript, when maximally derepressed by withdrawal of tetracycline, never exceeded five times that of the endogenous CcnD3 mRNA (Fig. 1 B), suggesting that the effect prevailed at relatively low concentrations of the transgenic 3′-UTR. We concluded that the transgenic D3 3′-UTR was acting in trans to block glucocorticoid-mediated destabilization of CcnD3 mRNA. To test this prediction, a number of P1798 cell lines were generated that stably expressed the β-galactosidase gene, with or without the cyclin D3 3′-UTR, under the control of a tetracycline-repressible promoter. All of the clones that were subsequently analyzed for cyclin D3 expression (six clones) exhibited essentially the same properties as the two clones for which β-galactosidase activity data are shown in Fig. 2 A. Four such clones were analyzed, and all showed essentially the same properties. Theopen bars in Fig. 2 A illustrate the properties of those clones that express β-gal, whereas the filled barsillustrate the properties of those cells that express β-galactosidase fuse to the D3 3′-UTR chimera (β-galD3UTR). Initially, we noted that the level of expression of the β-galD3UTR chimeric gene was consistently lower than that of authentic β-gal. (Note that the scales are different in Fig. 2 A.) We have shown that the D3 3′-UTR increases the turnover of tetD3 transgenic RNAs, and we suspect that this reproducible difference in β-galactosidase activity may be due to an increased turnover of β-galD3UTR transcripts; however, the rates of degradation of the β-galactosidase mRNAs have not been measured. We also observed that dexamethasone had no effect on β-galactosidase expression, irrespective of the presence or absence of the D3 3′-UTR. This observation is consistent with the data shown in Fig. 1 B, which indicate that the presence or absence of the D3 3′-UTR did not affect glucocorticoid regulation of the tetD3 transgenes. Finally, tetracycline inhibition of β-galactosidase activity was >95% for the cell line illustrated in Fig. 2 Aand for all cell lines used in the experiments described below. Because tetracycline regulates the transcription of the transgene, it is reasonable to assume that the decrease in β-galactosidase activity that can be observed upon addition of tetracycline is associated with and attributable to a corresponding decrease in β-galactosidase mRNA. Glucocorticoid regulation of CcnD3 mRNA was measured in several clones that express β-gal and β-galD3UTR transgenes, as shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 2, B and C, illustrates the properties of two clones that express authentic β-gal mRNA. The abundance of CcnD3 mRNA decreased rapidly upon addition of dexamethasone, indicating that expression of β-galactosidase had no effect on glucocorticoid-mediated inhibition of CcnD3 mRNA abundance (filled circles). Conversely, little or no decrease in CcnD3 mRNA was observed when dexamethasone was added to βgalD3UTR clones, as shown in Fig. 2, D–G (filled circles). These results indicate that cells that express the β-galactosidase/cyclin D3 3′-UTR chimera were resistant to glucocorticoid inhibition of cyclin D3 expression. The abundance of CcnD3 mRNA decreased rapidly when dexamethasone was added to βgalD3UTR cells that had been treated with tetracycline (Fig. 2,D–G, open circles), indicating that glucocorticoid inhibition of CcnD3 mRNA expression was restored when transcription of the β-galD3UTR chimeric transgene was repressed. Tetracycline had no effect upon glucocorticoid inhibition of cyclin D3 expression in cells that express β-galactosidase without the CcnD3 3′-UTR (Fig. 2,B and C, open circles). The data shown in Figs. 1 and 2 suggest that there are sequences within the D3 3′-UTR that influence glucocorticoid regulation of the stability of CcnD3 mRNA. These elements appear to act in trans, to the extent that overexpression of the 3′-UTR from a transgene (tetD3FL or β-galD3UTR) interferes with regulation of the endogenous CcnD3 mRNA. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that sequences within the transgenic 3′-UTR are acting as molecular decoys, titrating cellular proteins that would otherwise interact with the endogenous transcript to affect glucocorticoid regulation of CcnD3 mRNA stability. RNA mobility shift assays were used to identify potential RNA-protein interactions within the CcnD3 3′-UTR. The full-length CcnD3 3′-UTR was transcribed in vitro in the presence of α-32P-labeled nucleoside triphosphates. The full-length, labeled 3′-UTR transcript, ∼1000 bases long, was incubated with S-100 cytoplasmic extracts, which were prepared from exponentially growing P1798 cells. Ribonuclease T1 was added to degrade those regions of the transcript that were not protected by stable RNA-protein complexes. The T1 resistance complexes were then resolved by electrophoresis on nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels, as shown in Fig.3. Lane 1 of Fig.3 A contains a ribonuclease T1-resistant RNA-protein complex (arrow). Formation of this complex was precluded by addition of 120 ng of unlabeled CcnD3 3′-UTR (lane 2) However, addition of 120 ng of unlabeled E. coli β-galactosidase mRNA failed to compete for binding of S100 proteins to the CcnD3 3′-UTR (lane 3). Fig. 3 B shows the results of an experiment in which labeled CcnD3 3′-UTR was incubated with increasing amounts of S100 protein. The results indicate that formation of the gel shift entity requires the presence of S100 protein (lane 1) and is not simply a ribonuclease T1-resistant fragment. The intensity of the shifted band increased as a function of the protein concentration in the binding reaction (lanes 2 and 3). Furthermore, the shifted band was abolished when the ribonuclease T1-resistant complex was treated with proteinase K before electrophoresis (lane 4), indicating that the labeled band that we observed results from formation of an RNA-protein complex. An RNA mobility shift assay was performed, and the RNA-protein complex was excised from the gel. The labeled RNA was isolated and digested to completion with ribonuclease T1. The products of ribonuclease T1 digestion were s"

Science. 1991; 251: 1451-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2990) Google Scholar). Importantly, emerging evidence has indicated that the proteins that constitute these junctions, such as components of the cadherin-catenin complex, promote cell-cell communication and intracellular signaling in a manner that is intimately interdependent with their structural roles (2Vleminckx K. Kemler R. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 211-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). For example, morphogenetic events occurring during embryonic development, which include vast cell migrations, require that cellular junctions be highly dynamic. Similarly, in the adult, processes such as wound repair must take place with expedience and precision, regenerating intercellular junctions and hence intercellular “relationships” characteristic of that tissue. Failures within embryonic or adult junctional structures is associated with grave pathologies, including birth defects and cancer, made evident in reduced cellular “identity”/differentiation and increased cell aggressiveness as reflected in heightened cell motility, invasion, and metastasis (3Perl A.K. Wilgenbus P. Dahl U. Semb H. Christofori G. Nature. 1998; 392: 190-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (1205) Google Scholar, 4Yap A.S.

Thus, the means by which junctional complexes are modulated in both health and disease constitutes an area of considerable interest. We are interested in the roles that catenins play in regulating cadherin cell-cell adhesive/motility function, and in this report focus on XenopusARVCF1 (Xarvcf). The cadherin proteins comprise a family of transmembrane receptors that mediate cell-cell adhesion via the calcium-dependent homophilic binding of their extracellular domains. Although classical cadherins possess extracellular domains capable of engaging in weak adhesive activity in the absence of the cytoplasmic domain, full “adhesive strengthening” requires intact cadherin protein (6Nagafuchi A. Takeichi M. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3679-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar, 7Ozawa M. Baribault H. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1711-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic domain of classical cadherins contains two highly conserved regions that directly bind other proteins termed catenins. Catenins associate in turn with multiple other signaling and structural components, including kinases, phosphatases, and actin-associated proteins, together forming a complex higher order structure that is presently only partially understood (8Provost E. Rimm D.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 567-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 9Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 399-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). Crucial components of the cadherin cell-cell adhesion complex include β-catenin or plakoglobin (γ-catenin), which bind in a mutually exclusive manner to the distal portion of the cadherin cytoplasmic domain and thereby link cadherin to α-catenin, α-actinin, and the cortical actin-cytoskeleton. This indirect association of cadherin with the actin-cytoskeletal network appears pivotal in modulating cadherin adhesive capacity, with increased cadherin-cytoskeletal association correlating with increased cadherin adhesive function (7Ozawa M. Baribault H. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1711-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar, 10Navarro P. Caveda L. Breviario F. Mandoteanu I. Lampugnani M.G. Dejana E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30965-30972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Independent of the indirect association of the distal cytoplasmic domain of cadherin with the cortical actin cytoskeleton, recent work has indicated that the juxtamembrane region of the cadherin cytoplasmic tail is likewise critical to cadherin adhesive function (11Yap A.S. Brieher W.M. Pruschy M. Gumbiner B.M. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 308-315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Although published studies are not in complete agreement, a consensus appears to exist that the juxtamembrane region directly or indirectly contributes to modulating (positively, negatively, or both) lateral cadherin dimerization/clustering within the plasma membrane plane, and that such lateral organization is an important determinant of adhesive interactions with similarly organized cadherins presented from neighboring cells (12Ozawa M. Kemler R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1605-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 13Yap A.S. Niessen C.M. Gumbiner B.M. J.

The identification and characterization of protein factors binding cadherin juxtamembrane domains, therefore, is believed to be crucial in understanding the physiologic or pathologic modulation of cadherin-based adhesion. In this regard, some members of a subset of the Armadillo protein family, the p120ctnsubfamily, have already been shown to bind the cadherin juxtamembrane region (13Yap A.S. Niessen C.M. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 779-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 15Finnemann S. Mitrik I. Hess M. Otto G. Wedlich D. J. Biol.

All members of the Armadillo protein family are characterized by a central domain containing repeats of 40–42 amino acids important for protein-protein interactions (21Peifer M. Berg S. Reynolds A.B. Cell. 1994; 76: 789-791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar).

The p120ctn subfamily is distinguished from other Armadillo family members by the number and organization of the Armadillo repeats, exonic organization, and the presence of multiple isoforms, which result from differential mRNA splicing (39Hatzfeld M. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1999; 186: 179-224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Anastasiadis P.Z. Reynolds A.B. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1319-1334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Armadillo domain of p120ctn subfamily members is composed of 10 imperfect Armadillo repeats (β-catenin and plakoglobin, in contrast, possess 12.5 repeats), with spacer sequences following repeats 4, 5, and 6. Thus far, all p120ctn subfamily members localize to adherens junctions or desmosomes, and, of further interest, all have additionally been detected within the nucleus. In this regard, p120ctn was recently found to bind a novel POZ zinc finger transcription factor, Kaiso (41Daniel J.M. Reynolds A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3614-3623Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). A role of p120ctnin regulating cadherin-mediated adhesion together with possible nuclear functions is reminiscent of β-catenin, however, the specific contributions of p120ctn to nuclear processes, including transcriptional regulation, are not yet clear. Proposed functions of the cadherin juxtamembrane domain have generated considerable interest even while published results have not been in complete accordance. For example, although the juxtamembrane region of C-cadherin appears to be required for its lateral clustering (13Yap A.S. Niessen C.M. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 779-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar) and can support clustering and adhesion for VE-cadherin (10Navarro P. Caveda L. Breviario F. Mandoteanu I. Lampugnani M.G. Dejana E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30965-30972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), that of E-cadherin has been reported to either likewise facilitate (20Thoreson M.A. Anastasiadis P.Z. Daniel J.M. Ireton R.C. Wheelock M.J. Johnson K.R. Hummingbird D.K. Reynolds A.B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 189-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) or reduce cadherin dimerization/adhesive function (12Ozawa M. Kemler R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1605-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 14Aono S. Nakagawa S. Reynolds A.B. Takeichi M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 551-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 18Ohkubo T. Ozawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21409-21415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Complementing the examination of the cadherin juxtamembrane region in the positive and/or negative modulation of cadherin dimerization, clustering, and adhesion, attention has focused upon directly associated p120ctn family members. For example, E-cadherin constructs containing site-directed mutations in the juxtamembrane region abrogate its association with p120ctn (but not with β-catenin), and in contrast to native E-cadherin, fail to confer strong adhesive activity when transfected into cadherin-deficient cells (20Thoreson M.A. Anastasiadis P.Z. Daniel J.M. Ireton R.C. Wheelock M.J. Johnson K.R. Hummingbird D.K. Reynolds A.B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 189-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Thus, in this case, the capacity of p120ctn to associate with the juxtamembrane region of cadherin was positively associated with cadherin adhesive capacity. Other studies, including earlier work from our group, have indicated that p120ctnexpression is capable of reducing cadherin-mediated adhesion (14Aono S. Nakagawa S. Reynolds A.B. Takeichi M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 551-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 18Ohkubo T. Ozawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21409-21415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar,19Paulson A.F. Fang X. Ji H. Reynolds A.B. McCrea P.D. Dev. Biol. 1999; 207: 350-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Although a limited number of studies appear difficult to reconcile, synthesis may be approached if one accepts the possibility that p120ctn imposes both positive and negative effects upon cadherin adhesive function. Indeed, the validity of such a view has been heightened by recent findings suggesting that the phosphorylation of specific residues within the N-terminal domain of p120ctn (14Aono S. Nakagawa S. Reynolds A.B. Takeichi M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 551-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 18Ohkubo T. Ozawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21409-21415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) determines the extent to which p120ctn promotes or inhibits cadherin adhesive function, speculatively via differential capacities to recruit unknown cofactors. The juxtamembrane region of cadherin binds additional factors distinct from p120ctn, but which still belong to the p120ctn subfamily of Armadillo proteins. For example, δ-catenin/NPRAP is a p120ctn subfamily member that likewise binds cadherin juxtamembrane regions via its central Armadillo domain (17Lu Q. Paredes M. Medina M. Zhou J. Cavallo R. Peifer M. Orecchio L. Kosik K.S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 519-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Intriguingly consistent with its primary expression in neural tissue (31Paffenholz R. Franke W.W. Differentiation. 1997; 61: 293-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 32Zhou J. Liyanage U. Medina M. Ho C. Simmons A.D. Lovett M. Kosik K.S. Neuroreport. 1997; 8: 1489-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and perhaps with its purported role in modulating cadherin function (17Lu Q. Paredes M. Medina M. Zhou J. Cavallo R. Peifer M. Orecchio L. Kosik K.S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 519-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), hemizygosity for δ-catenin is correlated with severe mental retardation in humans (42Medina M. Marinescu R.C. Overhauser J. Kosik K.S. Genomics. 2000; 63: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). On the cellular level, δ-catenin appears to share some features with p120ctn, for example, δ-catenin's ectopic expression in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells induces cell shape changes and increases cell scattering in response to the addition of hepatocyte growth factor (17Lu Q. Paredes M. Medina M. Zhou J. Cavallo R. Peifer M. Orecchio L. Kosik K.S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 519-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In addition, δ-catenin localizes to the nucleus, although in contrast to p120ctn (or β-catenin), nuclear (transcriptional?) cofactors have not yet been discerned (17Lu Q. Paredes M. Medina M. Zhou J. Cavallo R. Peifer M. Orecchio L. Kosik K.S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 519-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The ARVCF protein was identified on the basis of primary sequence similarity to known p120ctn family members (38Sirotkin H. O'Donnell H. DasGupta R. Halford S. St. Jore B. Puech A. Parimoo S. Morrow B. Skoultchi A. Weissman S.M. Scambler P. Kucherlapati R. Genomics. 1997; 41: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Of the Armadillo proteins, ARVCF is most closely related to p120ctn, sharing significant homology within the central Armadillo domain (55% identity), and even within the generally more divergent N and C termini (respectively, 42% and 31% identity). Interestingly, the ARVCF gene was found to reside within a chromosomal region deleted in velocardiofacial syndrome, a human syndrome characterized by multiple congenital abnormalities, including cleft palate and heart defects, and indicative of underlying failures in neural crest cell migration (38Sirotkin H. O'Donnell H. DasGupta R. Halford S. St. Jore B. Puech A. Parimoo S. Morrow B. Skoultchi A. Weissman S.M. Scambler P. Kucherlapati R. Genomics. 1997; 41: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Recently, Mariner et al. (43Mariner D.J. Wang J. Reynolds A.B. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1481-1490PubMed Google Scholar) reported that ARVCF and p120ctn compete for binding to E-cadherin, consistent with the idea that ARVCF also binds the the juxtamembrane domain of cadherins. In the present work, we report the cloning of the Xenopusortholog of human ARVCF, which we name Xarvcf. The use of alternative start codons and differential splicing of the transcript produces several isoforms, some of which were revealed to be temporally and spatially regulated during development. Furthermore, we were interested to observe shifts in the electrophoretic mobility of Xarvcf protein during gastrulation, likely due to changes in its phosphorylation. We demonstrate that, in common with p120ctn and δ-catenin, Xarvcf binds the juxtamembrane region of C-cadherin and that this association is abolished following site-directed mutagenesis of C-cadherin's juxtamembrane region. Thus, Xarvcf joins p120ctn and δ-catenin as a p120ctn subfamily member binding the cadherin membrane proximal region and possessing various isoforms, and more speculatively, modulating cadherin-dependent adhesive strength via effects on cadherin dimerization/clustering. A short fragment of Xarvcf cDNA was amplified from a Xenopus stage 17 cDNA library (44Kintner C.R. Melton D.A. Development. 1987; 99: 311-325Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using degenerate primers (5′ GAY CAY CCI AAR AAR GAR GTI CA 3′ (mouse aa DHPKKEVHI) and 5′ GCG AAT TCR CAN ACR CAR TTY TCN AC 3′ (mouse aa DKSVENCV)) corresponding to a region within the central Armadillo repeat domain of mouse p120ctn (28Reynolds A.B. Herbert L. Cleveland J.L. Berg S.T. Gaut J.R. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 2439-2445PubMed Google Scholar). PCR conditions used an annealing temperature of 50 °C and 35 cycles. The 488-bp sequence was then used to design primers for amplification of the full-length cDNA sequence from a Xenopus oocyte stage cDNA library (Xenopus MATCHMAKER cDNA library, pGAD10 vector, CLONTECH). This was accomplished using anchored PCR (45Macrae A.D. Brenner S. Genomics. 1994; 24: 176-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), which utilizes vector-specific primers and gene-specific primers to amplify unknown sequence, and by applying RACE of oocyte mRNA using the Marathon cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH). Once the entire coding sequence was identified, a full-length cDNA for each isoform was generated from the cDNA library by PCR with Expand High Fidelity PCR system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or by PCR of cDNA reverse-transcribed (Moloney murine leukemia virus, Life Technologies, Inc.) using poly(T)20 primers and 1 μg of total oocyte RNA. The product for each isoform was gel-purified using a QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen) and subcloned into the TA vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced. The primers used for Xarvcf-1B, Xarvcf-1AB, Xarvcf-2B, Xarvcf-2AB were as follows. ATG-1: 5′-ATAGATGCCTGCCGAACTC-3′, ATG-2: 5′-ATGATGCAGGAACCTCCAGAAATGC-3′, with A insert: 5′-TTAGACCCAGGAGTCAACAGGCTG-3′, without A insert: 5′-GGTCTTCCCAAAAAGGGTCACTGC-3′. Protein motifs were identified using the program PPSEARCH/Prosite found on the Web. Protein and cDNA alignments utilized the ClustalW algorithm (46Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56002) Google Scholar). To localize the C-cadherin JMR construct to the plasma membrane via its N terminus, the c-src myristylation motif MGSSKSKPKD (47Buss J.E. Der C.J. Solski P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3960-3963Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) was inserted upstream of the myc epitope tag (MT) at the BamHI and ClaI sites in the pCS2+MT vector (48Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1434-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). This was done using the oligonucleotides: 5′ GAT CCG CCG CCA CCA TGG GAT CGT CTA AGT CGA AGC CTA AGG ATC AT 3′ and 5′ CGA TGA TCC TTA GGC TTC GAC TTA GAC GAT CCC ATG GTG GCG GCG 3′. JMR-Myr.MT constructs were made through the insertion of C-cadherin aa 744–808 into the ClaI site using the PCR primers 5′ CCA TCG ATG GAA GAG AAA GAA G 3′ and 5′ CCA TCG ATG TGG GGC AGG CAT 3′. JMR-MT without the myristylation motif was constructed by subcloning the JMR into the BamHI and ClaI sites of pCS2+MT using the primer pair 5′ CGG GAT CCA GAT GAA GAG AAA GAA G 3′ and 5′ CCA TCG ATG TGG GGC AGG CAT 3′. To generate the JMRGA mutant constructs, PCR-mediated mutagenesis was utilized to change glycines 771, 772, and 773 to alanine, employing the PCR primer pair 5′ GAG GAA GCT GCA GCA GAG GAG 3′ and 5′ CTC CTC TGC TGC AGC TTC CTC 3′. Total RNA was isolated from embryos using the phenol/guanidine isothiocyanate-based reagent Trizol (Life Technologies, Inc.), and mRNA was purified using an mRNA purification kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), each according to the manufacturer's instructions. For Northern blots, total RNA was separated on formaldehyde/agarose gels, transferred to a Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) employing the PosiBlot 30-30 Pressure Blotter (Stratagene), and subsequently UV-X-linked to the membrane. The Xarvcf probe was random prime-labeled with [32P]dCTP using Ready-To-Go DNA labeling beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Ultrahyb (CLONTECH) was used for blocking and hybridization. For detection of transcripts by PCR, cDNA was generated from 1 μg of total RNA using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase or Superscript (Life Technologies, Inc.), employing random hexamers (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or poly(T)20 oligo. The RT-PCR assays were semiquantitative. The linear range for each primer set was determined by removing 5-μl aliquots from the PCR reaction tube at 5-cycle intervals and comparing band intensities of the products run out in an agarose gel. For reactions producing two bands, the cycle number that allowed the detection of the band present at lower levels was utilized. N-terminal isoforms: 57 °C, 30 cycles, 5′-ATAGATGCCTGCCGAACTC-3′, 5′-TTAATCCCCGAGACAGGCTGC-3′; C-terminal isoforms: 53 °C, 30 cycles, 5′-GATGACAGCACACTACCATTGG-3′, 5′-GGTCTTCCCAAAAAGGGTCACTGC-3′; all transcripts: 65 °C, 25 cycles, 5′-GCTTGTGGAGCACTGCGGAACA-3′, 5′-GCAAAGCATCCACTAGCCCGTC-3′; controls: ODC: 55 °C, 24 cycles, 5′-GGAGCTGCAAGTTGGAGA-3′, 5′-CTCAGTTGCCAGTGTGGTC-3′ (64Hudson C.

Xarvcf peptides SNIDLNRSQPERFQ(C) (aa 204–217) and EDSKPRDAEWSTVF(C) (aa 471–484) were synthesized by the Synthetic Antigen Core Facility at M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. Peptides (C)YGLEDDNRSLGADD (aa 221–234) and (C)LRNISYGKDNENKV (aa 389–402) were synthesized by Genosys. The four peptides were conjugated to keyhole limpet hemacyanin facilitated by the presence of an added cysteine residue to the N or C termini of the peptide. Rabbits were immunized with a mixture of the four keyhole limpet hemacyanin-linked peptides, and the preimmune and immune sera tested against exogenously expressed HA-tagged Xarvcf protein and endogenous Xarvcf in Xenopus embryo extracts. The anti-peptide antibodies were affinity-purified with the same peptides covalently bound to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma). The affinity-purified antibody was again tested against both exogenous HA-tagged Xarvcf and endogenous Xarvcf. A polyclonal antibody was also generated against full-length Xarvcf, using the Xarvcf-2B isoform to avoid the induction of isoform-specific antibodies. Xarvcf-2B was subcloned into the pQE32 vector (QIAexpress System, Qiagen) with N-terminal 6xHis tag by adding PCR-generated XhoI restriction sites on both ends and ligating into the compatible ends of the SalI site of pQE-32. The 6xHis-Xarvcf-2B fusion protein was expressed and purified using Ni-NTA matrices according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). Two rabbits were immunized with full-length Xarvcf-2B-6xHis fusion protein, and the preimmune and immune sera were tested against endogenous and exogenous HA-tagged Xarvcf. Xenopus eggs were obtained and fertilized using standard methods (49Newport J. Kirschner M. Cell. 1982; 30: 675-686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1190) Google Scholar), dejellied with 2% cysteine HCl (pH 8.0), rinsed, and incubated in 0.1× MMR (1× MMR: 10 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm KCl, 0.1 mmMgSO4, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). Embryos were placed in 1× MMR with 4% Ficoll and injected with mRNA at two-cell or four-cell embryo stages. Injected embryos were transferred to 0.1× MMR with antibiotics and cultured between 14 and 18 °C. Embryos were staged according to the normal table of Xenopus laevis development (50Nieuwkoop P.D.

For expression in Xenopus embryos, the full-length Xarvcf cDNA isoforms were subcloned by PCR (Expand High Fidelity PCR system, Roche Molecular Biochemical"
https://openalex.org/W2163869291,"Using synthetic inhibitors, it has been shown that the ectopeptidase dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DP IV) (CD26) plays an important role in the activation and proliferation of T lymphocytes. The human immunodeficiency virus-1 Tat protein, as well as the N-terminal nonapeptide Tat(1–9) and other peptides containing the N-terminal sequence XXP, also inhibit DP IV and therefore T cell activation. Studying the effect of amino acid exchanges in the N-terminal three positions of the Tat(1–9) sequence, we found that tryptophan in position 2 strongly improves DP IV inhibition. NMR spectroscopy and molecular modeling show that the effect of Trp2-Tat(1–9) could not be explained by significant alterations in the backbone structure and suggest that tryptophan enters favorable interactions with DP IV. Data base searches revealed the thromboxane A2 receptor (TXA2-R) as a membrane protein extracellularly exposing N-terminal MWP. TXA2-R is expressed within the immune system on antigen-presenting cells, namely monocytes. The N-terminal nonapeptide of TXA2-R, TXA2-R(1–9), inhibits DP IV and DNA synthesis and IL-2 production of tetanus toxoid-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Moreover, TXA2-R(1–9) induces the production of the immunosuppressive cytokine transforming growth factor-β1.

DP IV is a type II membrane glycoprotein and is identical to the activation antigen CD26 expressed on T lymphocytes, activated B lymphocytes, and natural killer cells. It has been shown that DP IV plays a key role in the regulation of differentiation and growth of lymphocytes (3.Fleischer B. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 180-184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Specific DP IV inhibitors, such as Lys[Z(NO2)]-thiazolidide and Lys[Z(NO2)]-pyrrolidide, suppress mitogen- and alloantigen-induced T cell proliferation, B cell differentiation, and immunoglobulin secretion (4.Kähne T. Lendeckel U. Wrenger S. Neubert K. Ansorge S. Reinhold D. Int. J. Mol. Med. 1999; 4: 3-15PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, these DP IV inhibitors reduce the production of the cytokines IL-2, IL-10, IL-12, and interferon-γ and enhance that of the immunosuppressive cytokine TGF-β1. TGF-β1 is shown to be at least in part responsible for the immunosuppressive effects of DP IV inhibitors (5.Reinhold D. Bank U. Bühling F. Lendeckel U. Faust J. Neubert K. Ansorge S.

Moreover, Tat(1–86) distinctly suppresses DNA synthesis of antigen- as well as mitogen-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and T cells in the same concentration range as the highly specific DP IV inhibitor Lys[Z(NO2)]-thiazolidide (IC50 = 2.7 μm) (7.Wrenger S.

This suggests that immunosuppressive effects of HIV-1 are at least in part mediated by Tat-DP IV interactions.

Recently, we demonstrated the striking dependence of both DP IV inhibition and suppression of DNA synthesis, by Tat(1–9) and two Tat(1–9) analogues, Ile5-Tat(1–9) and Leu6-Tat(1–9), from their solution conformations. This provides further evidence for the mediation of antiproliferative effects of HIV-1 Tat via specific interactions of Tat with T cell-expressed DP IV (8.Wrenger S. Hoffmann T. Faust J.

The function of the viral protein Tat as an immunomodulatory oligopeptide implies the existence of soluble or cell surface-expressed endogenous counterparts,e.g. on antigen-presenting cells, down-regulating the activation of T cells by inhibiting DP IV. In this study, our strategy was to find peptidergic DP IV inhibitors by testing Tat(1–9) analogue peptides carrying exchanges in the first three amino acids. On the basis of the obtained N-terminal sequence, protein data base searches for potential ligands were performed. Of all examined Tat(1–9)-derived peptides, Trp2-Tat(1–9) turned out to be the most potent DP IV inhibitor. A data base search for the N-terminal motif MWP of Trp2-Tat(1–9) discloses the thromboxane-A2 receptor (TXA2-R) (Swiss-Prot accession number P21731) sequence. The N-terminal nonapeptide of TXA2-R, TXA2-R(1–9), exerts inhibitory effects comparable to those of Trp2-Tat(1–9) on DP IV activity and on DNA synthesis of activated PBMC. Interestingly, TXA2-R is localized on the surface of monocytes known as antigen-presenting cells and intensively interacting with T cells during antigen presentation (14.Simmons T.R. Cook J.A. Moore J.N. Halushka P.V. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1993; 53: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 15.Allan C.J. Halushka P.V. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 270: 446-452PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, TXA2-R on monocytes could represent a physiological inhibitor of T cell-expressed DP IV/CD26 and could be involved in immunomodulatory processes mediated via inhibition of DP IV enzymatic activity. DP IV was purified from human kidney cortex. Membrane proteins were solubilized by the addition of 1% Triton X-100 to the homogenized tissue for 1 h. Subsequently a fractionated ammonium sulfate precipitation was performed. The fraction between 50 and 65% saturation, containing most of the DP IV, was used for further purification by means of three different steps of liquid chromatography. After gel chromatography on Sepharose 6B, the pooled DP IV+ fractions were applied on a Sephadex A50 ion exchange column and eluted with an increasing NaCl gradient. The final polishing step was performed with a FPLC POROS HQ ion exchange column. The resulting DP IV preparation has a specific activity of 32 units/mg and shows no contaminations upon silver-stained polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Soluble human DP IV was produced recombinantly in Chinese hamster ovary cells (16.Oravecz T. Pall M. Roderiquez G. Gorrell M.D. Ditto M. Nguyen N.Y. Boykins R. Unsworth E. Norcross M.A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1865-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The cell culture supernatant of these transfected cells (gift from Dr. M. Gorrell, Sydney, Australia) was applied on a FPLC POROS HQ ion exchange column. The column was eluted with an increasing NaCl gradient. DP IV-containing fractions were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (silver-stained) and the fractions without contaminations were pooled for further use. The chromogenic DP IV substrate Ala-Pro-pNA was synthesized according to standard procedures (17.Heins J. Welker P. Schonlein C. Born I. Hartrodt B. Neubert K. Tsuru D. Barth A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 954: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The substrate IL-2(1–12) and effector peptides were obtained by solid-phase peptide synthesis with Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methyloxycarbonyl) technique using peptide synthesizer 431A (Applied Biosystems). The synthetic peptides were purified by reversed-phase HPLC and analyzed by mass spectrometry and elemental analysis. Human kidney DP IV assay solution was prepared in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 2 mm EGTA to inhibit activities of putative metalloprotease impurities. After preincubation (30 min at 37 °C) of 550 femtokatals of DP IV with 400 μm (final concentration in 10 mm sodium phosphate assay buffer, pH 7.5) of the effector peptide in Sigmacote-coated (Sigma) reaction vials, the enzymatic reaction was started by addition of IL-2(1–12) substrate (final concentration, 400 μm). Samples were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by addition of 30 mmphosphoric acid. Degradation of IL-2(1–12) was measured by capillary electrophoresis using Biofocus 3000 system (Bio-Rad). Separations were performed with a polyacrylamide-coated silica capillary (Bio-Rad; inner diameter 50 nm, length 30 cm) working at a constant voltage of 17 kV (positive to negative). For quantification of IL-2(1–12) His as internal standard was added (18.Reinhold D. Wrenger S. Bank U. Bühling F. Hoffmann T. Neubert K. Kraft M. Frank R. Ansorge S. Immunobiology. 1996; 195: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The kinetic measurements were performed with soluble recombinant human DP IV in 0.04 m Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.6, I = 0.125 m with KCl. The K i values of inhibition of DP IV-catalyzed hydrolysis were determined using six different concentrations of Ala-Pro-pNA as substrate (10−5 to 8 × 10−5m) in the absence or presence of different inhibitor concentrations around the expectedK i value. The enzymatic hydrolysis of Ala-Pro-pNA was monitored at 390 nm and 30 °C on a Beckmann DU-650 UV/VIS spectrophotometer. All mixtures were started by adding the enzyme. Generally, the reaction velocities were calculated over a time interval in which less than 10% cleavage of substrate occurred. The K i values were evaluated within two independent measurements using the software Microcal origin 4.0 and SigmaPlot 5.0. NMR spectra were acquired on Bruker ARX 500, Bruker AVANCE 500, and Varian UNITY 500 instruments. Samples of 5 mg of the appropriate peptide were dissolved in 0.8 ml of H2O containing 10% D2O necessary for field frequency lock. 3-(Trimethylsilyl)-3,3,2,2-tetradeuteropropionic acid sodium salt was used as internal standard for water samples. Water signal suppression in 1H was achieved using presaturation during relaxation delay or the 3-9-19 pulse sequence with gradients (19.Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3525) Google Scholar, 20.Sklenar V. Piotto M. Leppik R. Saudek V. J. Magn. Reson. Ser. A. 1993; 102: 241-245Crossref Scopus (1111) Google Scholar). Spectra were acquired at 300 K. 32·1024 data points zero-filled to 64·1024 were employed to record one-dimensional spectra, whereas matrix sizes of 2·1024·512 zero-filled to 2·1024·1·1024 were used for two-dimensional experiments. Peaks were assigned by using H, H-COSY (21.Aue W.P. Bartholdi E. Ernst R.R. J. Chem. Phys. 1976; 64: 2229-2246Crossref Scopus (3089) Google Scholar), TOCSY (22.Braunschweiler L. Ernst R.R. J. Magn. Reson. 1983; 53: 521-528Crossref Scopus (3108) Google Scholar), NOESY (23.States D.J. Haberkorn R.A. Ruben D.J. J. Magn. Reson. 1982; 48: 286-292Google Scholar), and ROESY (24.Bothner-By A.A. Stephens R. Lee J. Warren C. Jeanloz R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 811-813Crossref Scopus (1966) Google Scholar). Homonuclear coupling constants were extracted from one-dimensional proton spectra using the same samples as for the two-dimensional experiments. TOCSY, NOESY, and ROESY spectra were recorded in the phase-sensitive mode (25.Müller L. Ernst R. Mol. Phys. 1979; 38: 963-992Crossref Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 26.Marion D. Wüthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 113: 967-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (3524) Google Scholar) and processed using baseline correction in both dimensions of the two-dimensional spectra. The TOCSY spectrum was carried out with the MLEV-17 sequence (27.Bax A. Davis D.G. J. Magn. Res. 1985; 65: 355-360Google Scholar) and an 80-ms spinlock. The NOESY and ROESY experiments were carried out with the pulse sequences supplied by Bruker and Varian. The mixing times for the ROESY spectra were 50, 100, 200, 300, and 400 ms. The Trp2-Tat(1–9) derivative was manually built in an extended, all-transconformation (trans-Trp2-Tat(1–9)) as well as in a conformation containing one cis peptide bond between the Trp2 and the Pro3 residues (cis-Trp2-Tat(1–9)). These structures were solvated by water using a precomputed water box of about 1400 solvent molecules (TIP3P water model) and were minimized to a convergence of energy gradient less than 0.001 kcal/mol × Å using the AMBER 4.1 force field (28.Weiner S.J. Kollmann P.A. Case D.A. Singh U.C. Ghio C. Alagano G. Profeta S.J. Weiner P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 765-784Crossref Scopus (4882) Google Scholar). A distance independent dielectric constant of ε = 1 was used. For the determination of the solution conformations 18 interresidue ROEs fortrans-Trp2-Tat(1–9) and 10 interresidue ROEs for cis-Trp2-Tat(1–9) obtained from the ROESY spectra were included as H-H distance restraints for molecular dynamics simulations in water. The distance restraints were applied with a force field constant of 32 kcal/Å. The residue-based cut-off distance for nonbonded interactions was set to 10 Å. All molecular dynamics simulations were carried out using periodic boundary conditions. The starting temperature was set to 10 K, followed by slowly heating to the reference temperature of 300 K. After 2 ps, the systems equilibrated at 300 K, the dynamics were performed for 800 ps, and the NTP ensemble was applied. The X-H bonds were constrained to constant values with the Shake procedure of AMBER. The time steps were 2 fs, and the nonbonded list was updated after 25 fs. The frequency of all dihedral angles particularly the dihedral angle φ of all amino acid residues was analyzed and compared with the experimental results based on the Karplus equations. Those conformations with the highest average frequency during the simulation time that agreed with the dihedral angles, φ, derived from the Karplus equations were used to generate solution conformations. These structures were subsequently minimized in solution. The stability of the solution conformations oftrans-Trp2-Tat(1–9) andcis-Trp2-Tat(1–9) was proved by additional dynamics simulations using the same conditions described above without H-H distance restraints. A tertiary structure model of the C-terminal region, the catalytically active domain of DP IV, has been developed recently (29.Brandt W. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2000; 477 (in press)Google Scholar). Based on this model, we intended to investigate possible docking arrangements of the TXA2-R(1–9) with DP IV. A slightly modified TRIPOS (30.Clark M. Cramer III, R.D. Van Opdenbosch N. J. Comp. Chem. 1989; 10: 982-991Crossref Scopus (2819) Google Scholar) force field was used. The parameters epsilon of the van der Waals force field term of all carbon atoms were increased by 0.2 kcal/mol. The nonbonded cut-off was set to 16 Å. This allows the application of simulated annealing techniques without applying a huge water box surrounding the whole enzyme-ligand complex. Performing simulated annealing runs by heating the system to 700 K within 2000 fs and cooling to 100 K in 2000 fs the ligands do not move far away from the enzyme at the high temperature, but only about 10 Å on average. During the annealing phase, a multitude of stable docking conformations preferably characterized by hydrophobic interactions and strong salt bridges were obtained. Altogether, four independent simulated annealing runs with different starting arrangements, each with 50 cycles, were performed. The backbone atoms of the enzyme were kept fixed. The resulting 400 low temperature structures were saved in a data base and subsequently minimized with the standard TRIPOS force field using Gasteiger charges (31.Gasteiger J. Marsili M. Tetrahedron. 1980; 36: 3219-3238Crossref Scopus (3600) Google Scholar) and a distant dependent dielectric function of ε = 4r. PBMC were prepared from heparinized blood of healthy donors as described by Reinhold et al. (32.Reinhold D. Bank U. Bühling F. Neubert K. Mattern T. Ulmer A.J. Flad H.D. Ansorge S. Immunobiology. 1993; 188: 403-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). PBMC (105cells/100 μl) were stimulated in serum-free CG medium (Vitromex) with tetanus toxoid (100 ng/ml; Calbiochem-Novabiochem, Bad Soden, Germany) in the presence of effector peptides in the concentrations indicated. After 6 days, cultures were pulsed for an additional 16 h with [3H]methylthymidine (0.2 μCi/well; ICN, Eschwege, Germany). Cells were harvested onto glass fiber filters, and the incorporated radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting. For cytokine determination, PBMC (106 cells/ml) were stimulated with 100 ng/ml tetanus toxoid in the presence or absence of DP IV inhibitors. After 24 h, culture supernatants were harvested and stored at −70 °C. The IL-2 concentrations of the cell culture supernatants were determined with commercially available sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Active TGF-β1 was measured with a specific TGF-β1 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using a mouse monoclonal anti-TGF-β1, -β2, and -β3 antibody and a chicken anti-TGF-β1 antibody (both from R&D Systems) as described by Danielpour (33.Danielpour D. J. Immunol. Methods. 1993; 158: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). This assay is sensitive to 50 pg of TGF-β1 per ml. Samples were tested before and after transient acidification (reduction of the pH to 1.5 by addition of 5n HCl for 30 min at 37 °C followed by neutralization with 1.4 n NaOH in 0.7 m Hepes) in order to determine latent TGF-β1 (34.Reinhold D. Bank U. Bühling F. Junker U. Kekow J. Schleicher E. Ansorge S. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 209: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To find out more clues about the consensus sequence of putative endogenous peptidergic DP IV inhibitors, we investigated the influence of some amino acid modifications and exchanges of the three N-terminal amino acids of the moderate DP IV inhibitor Tat(1–9) on the inhibition of DP IV. The high sensitivity and throughput of capillary electrophoresis permits the establishment of an enzymatic assay for human DP IV using IL-2(1–12), a more physiological substrate, instead of a chromogenic or fluorogenic dipeptide amide, such as Gly-Pro-pNA. For the first screening, Tat(1–9) analogue peptides and the substrate peptide were used in equimolar concentration (400 μm). The inhibition of DP IV-catalyzed IL-2(1–12) cleavage was not significantly improved by amino acid exchanges at position 1 (methionine) or 3 (proline). Instead of enhanced DP IV inhibition, reduced DP IV inhibition was observed with peptides obtained by the installation of methionine sulfoxide or small amino acids, such as proline, glycine, or alanine, instead of methionine at the N terminus (data not shown). However, the exchange of Asp2 by a series of hydrophobic as well as hydrophilic amino acids resulted in peptides with enhanced DP IV inhibitory effects (Fig.1). In equimolar concentration to the substrate, Ala2-, Phe2-, Lys2-, Gly2-, and Ser2-Tat(1–9) inhibited DP IV-catalyzed IL-2(1–12) cleavage in the region of 70% compared with 23% for Tat(1–9). Interestingly, the Tat(1–9) peptide with tryptophan at position 2 inhibited DP IV-catalyzed IL-2(1–12) degradation nearly completely (96%) under the conditions used and represents the best DP IV inhibitor of all Tat(1–9)-related peptides examined in this study. Moreover, with a continuous DP IV assay utilizing the chromogenic substrate Ala-Pro-pNA (K m = 15.3 μm) and soluble recombinant human DP IV, we estimated inhibition constants for Tat(1–9) and Trp2-Tat(1–9). In this assay, Tat(1–9) represented a parabolic mixed-type inhibitor with a K i value of 267 μm (α = 8.9, γ = 0.33, δ = 6.5), whereas Trp2-Tat(1–9) inhibited DP IV according to a linear mixed-type mechanism, with K i = 2.12 μm (α = 16), as will be described elsewhere. 2S. Lorey, A. Stöckel-Maschek, J. Faust, W. Brandt, B. Stiebitz, M. Gorrell, T. Kähne, S. Wrenger, D. Reinhold, S. Ansorge, and K. Neubert, manuscript in preparation. Thus, Trp2-Tat(1–9), carrying the N-terminal sequence MWP, is clearly a more potent DP IV inhibitor than Tat(1–9). The reinforcement of the DP IV inhibition by the exchange of Asp2 by the highly hydrophobic and bulky tryptophan could be due to basic changes in the backbone conformation of the nonapeptide. To solve this question, we studied the conformation of Trp2-Tat(1–9) in water solution by one- and two-dimensional 1H NMR techniques and restrained molecular dynamics simulations. The results were compared with the conformation of Tat(1–9), which was previously determined (8.Wrenger S. Hoffmann T. Faust J. Mrestani-Klaus C. Brandt W. Neubert K. Kraft M. Olek S. Frank R.

Brandt W. J. Mol. Model. 1998; 4: 200-210Crossref Google Scholar). In contrast to Tat(1–9) existing in one predominant conformation characterized by all-trans peptide bonds, the 1H NMR spectrum of Trp2-Tat(1–9) showed two major sets of signals exhibiting nearly the same population. One of these signal sets results from the cis conformer carrying a cispeptide bond between Trp2 and Pro3. The presence of this cis amide bond was established based on the characteristic exchange cross peaks obtained in the two-dimensional ROESY spectrum between Val4-CαHcis and trans, Val4-NH cisand trans, and Asp5-NH cis andtrans. Analogous to the major conformer of Tat(1–9), the second conformer of Trp2-Tat(1–9) is characterized byall-trans peptide bonds. Theoretical conformational energy calculations were carried out using the AMBER 4.1 force field. The solution conformations of bothtrans-Trp2-Tat(1–9) andcis-Trp2-Tat(1–9) were determined on the basis of the NMR data. The analysis of the dynamics trajectories of the dihedral angles φ, ψ, and χ1 gives insight into the conformational flexibility and the different structural behavior of this Tat derivative. Several solution conformations for thetrans and the cis isomers that agreed with the NMR data could be determined. All vicinal coupling constants (3JNH-CαH) and the corresponding torsion angles (φ) of this Tat derivative and the relevant interresidue ROEs suggested similar overall backbone conformations fortrans-Trp2-Tat(1–9) andcis-Trp2-Tat(1–9). The exchange of Asp2 with the hydrophobic tryptophan does not cause a significant rearrangement of the backbone structure of Trp2-Tat(1–9) compared with Tat(1–9) (Fig.2). The superpositions of the determined solution conformations of both trans and cisisomers of Trp2-Tat(1–9) show a relatively rigid structure along the residues Pro3 and Pro6. There are remarkable similarities between the solution conformations of both isomers (all-trans-Trp2-Tat(1–9) andcis-Trp2-Tat(1–9)) and Tat(1–9). In conclusion, the highly improved effect of Trp2-Tat(1–9) on DP IV inhibition cannot be explained by a significantly altered backbone structure of this analogue compared with that of Tat(1–9). The search for proteins extracellularly exposing the N-terminal XWP sequence using the Swiss-Prot protein database revealed a single hit, the thromboxane A2 receptor (TXA2-R) sequence. TXA2-R belongs to the G-protein-coupled receptor family. Because the N terminus is localized extracellularly, it is conceivable that TXA2-R is an endogenous DP IV inhibitor. To prove whether this holds true, we studied the influence of the N-terminal nonapeptide of TXA2-R, TXA2-R(1–9), on the enzymatic activity of DP IV and on the proliferation of stimulated PBMC. Indeed, TXA2-R(1–9) (MWPNGSSLG) inhibited DP IV-catalyzed IL-2(1–12) cleavage as potent as Trp2-Tat(1–9) (Fig.3 A). Compared with both Tat(1–9) and Trp2-Tat(1–9), TXA2-R(1–9) inhibits DP IV competitively. The K i value of 5.06 μmfor TXA2-R(1–9), determined using Ala-Pro-pNA and soluble human DP IV, is in the same range as the K i value of Trp2-Tat(1–9). Moreover, the reduction of DNA synthesis in tetanus toxoid-stimulated PBMC by TXA2-R(1–9) is as strong as by Trp2-Tat(1–9), which is in striking correlation with the effects of both peptides on DP IV activity (Fig. 3 B). This indicates a DP IV-mediated suppressive effect on DNA synthesis of stimulated immune cells by the N-terminal nonapeptide of TXA2-R. To address the question of whether the suppressive effect of DP IV-inhibitory peptides on DNA synthesis of tetanus toxoid-stimulated PBMC correlates with a decrease in production and secretion of cytokines, we measured the concentrations of IL-2 in supernatants of tetanus toxoid-stimulated PBMC in the presence of Tat(1–9), Trp2-Tat(1–9), and TXA2-R(1–9). Interestingly, as shown in Fig. 4, the IL-2 production was significantly reduced by all three DP IV inhibitors at concentrations of 20 μm after 24 h. To examine whether the immunoinhibitory cytokine TGF-β1 is involved in the DP IV inhibitor-induced suppression of DNA synthesis and IL-2 production, the concentrations of this cytokine in supernatants of tetanus toxoid-stimulated PBMC were assayed in the presence or absence of DP IV inhibitors. Interestingly, Tat(1–9), Trp2-Tat(1–9), and TXA2-R(1–9) were capable of inducing a 2-fold increase in secretion of latent TGF-β1 on tetanus toxoid-stimulated PBMC after a period of 24 h (Fig. 4). Moreover, to explain the enhanced inhibitory potential of nonapeptides bearing tryptophan at position 2, we investigated the docking behavior of TXA2-R(1–9) to the active site of DP IV.

https://openalex.org/W1984713099,"We had previously identified a distal regulatory element (DRE) in the mouse serum amyloid A3 (SAA3) promoter that functions as a cytokine-inducible transcription enhancer. Within this DRE, three functional elements interact with CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) and SAA3 enhancer factor (SEF) transcription factors. In this study, we show that cotransfection of the SEF expression plasmid with an SAA3/luciferase reporter resulted in 3-5-fold activation of the SAA3 promoter. When SEF-transfected cells were further stimulated with conditioned medium or interleukin-1, SAA3 promoter activity was dramatically increased, suggesting that SEF may cooperate functionally with other interleukin-1-inducible transcription factors to synergistically up-regulate SAA3 gene transcription. Indeed, cotransfection of SEF and NFkappaBp65 expression DNAs resulted in synergistic activation of the SAA3 promoter. Intriguingly, no consensus NFkappaB-binding site was found in the SAA3 promoter region; rather a putative NFkappaB-binding sequence with 3-base pair mismatches was identified in the DRE. When this sequence was used in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay, it interacted with NFkappaBp50, albeit with binding affinities that were several hundredfold lower than that with the consensus NFkappaB probe. Functional cooperation between SEF and NFkappaB was further strengthened by the finding that SEF and NFkappaB formed stable cytokine-inducible protein-protein complexes. Finally, despite its weak binding, mutation of this NFkappaB-binding site nevertheless dramatically reduced both NFkappaBp65- and cytokine-mediated induction of SAA3 promoter. Therefore, the molecular basis for the functional synergy between SEF and NFkappaB may, in part, be the ability of SEF to recruit NFkappaB through physical interactions that lead to enhancement or stabilization of NFkappaB binding to the SAA3 promoter element."
https://openalex.org/W2079691942,"Conserved residues in some of the transmembrane domains are proposed to mediate ion translocation by P-type pumps. The plasma membrane Ca(2+) pump (PMCA) lacks 2 of these residues in transmembrane domains (TM) 5 and 8. In particular, a glutamic acid (Glu-771) residue in TM5, which is proposed to be involved in the binding and transport of Ca(2+) by the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) pump (SERCA), is replaced by an alanine (Ala-854) in the PMCA pump. Ala-854 has been mutated to Glu, Asp, or Gln; Glu-975 in TM8, which is an Ala in the SERCA pump, has been mutated to Gln, Asp, or Ala. The mutants have been expressed in three cell systems, with or without the help of viruses. When expressed in large amounts in Sf9 cells, the mutated pumps were isolated and analyzed in the purified state. Two of the three TM8 mutants were correctly delivered to the plasma membrane and were active. All the TM5 mutants were retained in the endoplasmic reticulum; two of them (A854Q and A854E) retained activity. Their properties (La(3+) sensitivity and decay of the phosphorylated intermediate, higher cooperativity of Ca(2+) binding with a Hill's coefficient approaching 2) differed from those of the expressed wild type PMCA pump, and resembled those of the SERCA pump."

In the context of TFIID, TAFIIs have been shown to interact with 1) specific transcriptional activators to mediate activation, 2) basal transcription factors, 3) other TAFIIs, and 4) specific DNA sequences, such as the downstream promoter element or gene-specific core promoter sequence, thereby contributing to promoter selectivity (reviewed in Refs. 1Burley S.K.

Cell. 1998; 94: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar).Although many of the TAFII functions described above have been demonstrated in vitro, the role of TAFIIsin vivo has been controversial. Genetic experiments inDrosophila point to a role for TAFIIs in activated transcription during development (14Zhou J. Zwicker J. Szymanski P. Levine M. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13483-13488Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar); however, genetic studies in yeast have challenged the essential role of TAFIIs in regulated transcription suggested from the biochemical studies (15Walker S.S. Reese J.C. Apone L.M. Green M.R. Nature. 1996; 383: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 16Apone L.M. Virbasius C.A. Reese J.C. Green M.R.

Cell. 1997; 90: 607-614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). More recent studies suggest that the requirement for specific TAFIIs may be gene-specific. Indeed, genome-wide expression profiling in yeast demonstrates that 16% of 6000 genes in the yeast genome are affected by the inactivation of a temperature-sensitive allele of yTAFII145, the homolog of the largest metazoan TAFII250 (19Holstege F.C. Jennings E.G. Wyrick J.J. Lee T.I. Hengartner C.J. Green M.R. Golub T.R. Lander E.S. Young R.A. Cell. 1998; 95: 717-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1591) Google Scholar). By contrast, the effects of mutations in the yTAFII17 gene as well as yTAFII60 and yTAFII61 indicate that mutations in these TAFII genes lead to generalized reduction in RNA polymerase II transcription (20Apone L.M.

Cell. 1998; 2: 683-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Significantly, all three yTAFIIs contain histone-like folds, which may be essential for maintaining the integrity of the TFIID complex.Inactivation of certain yeast and mammalian TAFIIs results in cell cycle phenotypes; for example, cells arrest in G1/S when yTAFII145 or its mammalian homolog TAFII250 is inactivated (15Walker S.S. Reese J.C. Apone L.M. Green M.R. Nature. 1996; 383: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 24Sekiguchi T. Nohiro Y. Nakamura Y. Hisamoto N. Nishimoto T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3317-3325Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Examination of the promoters of genes affected by TAFII250 inactivation has demonstrated that responsiveness to TAFII250 resides in both upstream and core promoter sequences, suggesting that TAFIIs can regulate transcription through the core promoter (25Wang E.H. Zou S. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2658-2669Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 26Suzuki-Yagawa Y. Guermah M. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell.

By contrast, promoter mapping studies of yTAFII145-dependent genes has led to the conclusion that yTAFII145 functions to recognize the core promoter (28Shen W.-C. Green M.R. Cell. 1997; 90: 615-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In the case of yTAFII17, the upstream activating sequence appears to render some genes yTAFII17-dependent (20Apone L.M. Virbasius C.A. Holstege F.C. Wang J. Young R.A. Green M.R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 653-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). These studies collectively suggest that TAFIIs have distinct properties and that a subset of TAFIIs may be required for appropriate expression of each gene. The molecular basis for gene-specific requirement for TAFIIs remains to be determined. A gene may be dependent on a subset of TAFIIs for expression because it is regulated by site-specific transcription factors that require certain TAFIIs for activation or repression. On the other hand, some TAFIIs have been shown to contact core promoter directly, suggesting that TAFIIs can modulate the association of TFIID with promoter DNA in a manner dependent on the specific sequence of the gene promoter.To further characterize the function of individual TAFIIs and the relationship among TAFIIs and TBP within the context of TFIID, we have carried out biochemical analyses utilizing the vaccinia virus protein expression system (29Moss B. Elroy-Stein O. Mizukami T. Alexander W.A. Fuerst T.R. Nature. 1990; 348 (912): 919Crossref Scopus (448) Google Scholar). We have investigated TAFII-TAFII interactions between hTAFII250 (30Ruppert S.

The vaccinia virus protein expression system offers a number of advantages: 1) The recombinant proteins are expressed in mammalian cells and thus receive appropriate post-translational modifications; 2) the vaccinia virus/T7 RNA polymerase hybrid system permits coordinated expression of multiple genes by the T7 promoter (36Fuerst T.R. Earl P.L. Moss B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2538-2544Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar); 3) transient transfection of T7 promoter-regulated genes following infection with a virus expressing the T7 RNA polymerase leads to robust expression permitting the analysis of protein-protein interactions and complex assembly; and 4) coinfection with recombinant viruses carrying T7 promoter-regulated genes facilitates large scale production of proteins in a stable complex that can be purified and used in biochemical analyses. The transient transfection protocol allowed us to test a series of mutant constructs of hTAFII130 for TAFII-TAFII interactions and their ability to assemble into a partial complex with other subunits without the need to make recombinant viruses for each mutant. The recombinant viruses generated were used for purification of dimeric, trimeric, and tetrameric complexes.Using these vaccinia virus-based assays, we examined the assembly among TBP and different TAFII subunits and mapped the “surfaces” required for these interactions. We show the formation of TFIID complexes containing two, three, or four subunits and their role in transcriptional activation and TATA box binding. The functional analysis of individual TAFII subunits both separately and in the context of the partial TFIID complexes has permitted us to assess the role of each subunit in TFIID function.

We analyzed the translation efficiency of constructs containing the Cx41 5′-UTR linked to the green fluorescent protein reporter after injection of transcripts into one-cell stageXenopus embryos. The translational efficiency of the wild-type Cx41 5′-UTR was only 2% compared with that of the β-globin 5′-UTR. Mutation of each of the three uAUGs into AAG codons enhanced translation 82-, 9-, and 4-fold compared with the wild-type Cx41 5′-UTR. Based on these increased translation efficiencies, the percentages of ribosomes that recognized the uAUGs were calculated. Only 0.03% of the ribosomes that entered at the cap structure scanned the entire 5′-UTR and translated the main ORF. The results indicate that all uAUGs are recognized by the majority of the scanning ribosomes and that the three uAUGs strongly modulate translation efficiency inXenopus laevis embryos. Based on these data, a model of ribosomal flow along the mRNA is postulated. We conclude that the three uORFs may play an important role in the regulation of Cx41 expression.

Each connexon is a multimeric assembly of six proteins, the connexins. A connexin (Cx)1 contains four transmembrane domains and cytoplasmic N- and C-tails (2Sosinsky G. Curr. Top. Membr. 2000; 49: 1-22Google Scholar). Connexins form a multigene family comprised of at least 17 members in mouse, with orthologues in other vertebrate species (3Kumar N.M. Novartis Found. Symp. 1999; 219: 6-16PubMed Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the different family members are created by gene duplications (4Bruzzone R. White T.W. Paul D.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 1-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1227) Google Scholar). Connexins are highly related, i.e. 50–80% identical at amino acid level, with the most conserved sequences located in the transmembrane domains (5Goodenough D.A. Goliger J.A. Paul D.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 475-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar). Nearly all connexins studied so far have a common gene structure. Each gene consists of two exons, with a 5′-untranslated region (UTR) in the first exon and an uninterrupted open reading frame (ORF) and the 3′-UTR in the second exon (6Hennemann H. Kozjek G. Dahl E. Nicholson B. Willecke K. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 58: 81-89PubMed Google Scholar, 7Sullivan R. Ruangvoravat C. Joo D. Morgan J. Wang B.L. Wang X.K. Lo C.W. Gene ( Amst. ). 1993; 130: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The only exception known is the Cx35/36 subgroup that contains two introns (8O'Brien J. Bruzzone R. White T.W., AL- Ubaidi M.R. Ripps H. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7625-7637Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Belluardo N. Trovato-Salinaro A. Mudò G. Hurd Y.L. Condorelli D.F. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 57: 740-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Cell-cell communication via gap junctions is dynamically regulated at different levels as follows: transcription, translation, intracellular trafficking, oligomerization, docking, and gating (10Sáez J.C. Martı́nez A.D. Brañes M.C. González H.E. Braz. J. Med. Biol. Res. 1998; 31: 593-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The best studied mechanism is phosphorylation, which has an effect on the latter four levels. Regulation of gap junctional communication by phosphorylation is kinase- and connexin-specific, which makes it a very complex phenomenon (10Sáez J.C. Martı́nez A.D. Brañes M.C. González H.E. Braz. J. Med. Biol. Res. 1998; 31: 593-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The turnover rate of Cx proteins is rather high, 1–5 h (11Laing J.G. Tadros P.N. Westphale E.M. Beyer E.C. Exp. Cell. Res. 1997; 236: 482-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 12Beardslee M.A. Laing J.G. Beyer E.C. Saffitz J.E. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). This enables regulation at the transcriptional and translational levels. Several lines of evidence indicate that at least some connexins can be regulated at the mRNA level. (i) Cx43 expression is transcriptionally as well as translationally regulated in PC12 cells by Wnt1 (13Van der Heyden M.A.G. Rook M.B. Hermans M.M.P. Rijksen G. Boonstra J. Defize L.H.K. Destrée O.H.J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1741-1749Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). (ii) Translational control of rat Cx32 and Cx43 expression was suggested after discovery of an internal ribosome entry site enabling translation of these mRNAs under conditions when cap binding is compromised (14Schiavi A. Hudder A. Werner R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 464: 118-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). (iii) The stability of the rat Cx43 messenger is mediated by the binding of neuronal-specific proteins to its 3′-UTR (15Neve R.L. Ivins K.J. Tsai K-C. Rogers S.L. Perrone-Bizzozero N.I. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 65: 52-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). (iv) The existence of different mRNAs encoding mouse Cx26 (6Hennemann H. Kozjek G. Dahl E. Nicholson B. Willecke K. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 58: 81-89PubMed Google Scholar) and Cx32 (17Söhl G. Gillen C. Bosse F. Gleichmann M. Müller H.W. Willecke K. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 69: 267-275PubMed Google Scholar), different in the 5′-UTR only, suggests translational control. The ribosomal scanning model can explain translational control of most cellular messengers (18Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2788) Google Scholar). The 43 S preinitiation complex binds at the 5′-terminal cap structure and scans the 5′-UTR until the complex recognizes an AUG codon. Subsequently, the 60 S subunit joins and protein synthesis starts. Recognition of the AUG codon is dependent on the surrounding sequences and on the secondary structure of the mRNA (19Kozak M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8301-8305Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Usually, translation starts at the most 5′ AUG codon. When the 5′-UTR contains upstream AUGs (uAUGs), the main ORF can be translated by (i) ribosomes entering on an internal ribosome entry site, (ii) by termination at the upstream ORF and reinitiation at the next AUG, (iii) by leaky scanning, i.e. uAUGs are not recognized by all scanning ribosomal complexes, or (iv) by a combination of these processes (20Kozak M. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 27: 385-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Four Xenopus laevis connexins are known as follows: Cx30, Cx38, Cx41, and Cx43 (21Gimlich R.L. Kumar N.M. Gilula N.B. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1065-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 22Gimlich R.L. Kumar N.M. Gilula N.B. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 597-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 23Yoshizaki G. Patiño R. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 42: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The latter three connexins are expressed in the ovary. Only maternal Cx38 mRNA remains during early embryonic development (until stage 11). The first embryonic messenger is Cx30 (from stage 11 onward), while embryonic Cx41 and Cx43 transcripts appear at stage 25. The Cx41 transcript is expressed at a very low level (23Yoshizaki G. Patiño R. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 42: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 24). This paper describes the study on the translational control ofXenopus Cx41. The Cx41 5′-UTR contains three small open reading frames (uORFs) that might be involved in translational regulation of Cx41 expression. The effect of the three individual upstream AUG codons on translation efficiency was analyzed by mutating each of them into an AAG triplet. The presence of the three uAUGs strongly decreased the flow of ribosomes toward the initiation codon of the main ORF of the Cx41 mRNA. The effects of the single mutations of the uAUGs on reporter gene expression enabled us to calculate the efficiency of uAUG recognition by the ribosome. The Cx41 5′-UTR was amplified with a 5′/3′-RACE Kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Ovaria of adult X. laevis were dissected out of the animals after a 20-min anesthesia on ice, and total RNA was isolated and used for the synthesis of cDNA. The Cx41-specific reverse primers (TableI) Cx41-OR2, Cx41-OR1, and Cx41–5R1 were designed based on the published sequence (23Yoshizaki G. Patiño R. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 42: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The latter primer mutates the sequence around the ATG into an NcoI restriction site. The PCR cycling conditions were dependent on the primers used. In the first PCR, using Cx41-OR2, after the initial denaturation (5 min, 95 °C), 40 cycles were performed for denaturation (1 min, 95 °C), annealing (2 min, 55 °C), and elongation (2 min, 72 °C), followed by an extra elongation period of 10 min (72 °C). In the PCR with primer Cx41-OR1 the conditions were the same, except for the annealing temperature (5 cycles at 40 °C and 35 cycles at 45 °C). The PCR product was cloned into pBluescript SK+ provided with a NcoI site (kindly provided by A. Buchel, Leiden University, The Netherlands). After confirmation of the sequence (T7 Sequencing Kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) a forward primer (Cx41–5F1) was designed, consisting of a HindIII restriction site and nucleotides 1–18. A PCR was set up with this primer to facilitate the cloning of the PCR product into pT7TS. This vector was a gift of P. A. Krieg (University of Texas) and contains the Xenopus β-globin 5′-UTR (45 nt), 3′-UTR (157 nt), and a track of 30 A and C residues behind the 3′-UTR. The GFP ORF was inserted between the 5′ and 3′ UTR (see also Fig.2 A).Figure 4Effect of 5′-UTR AUG mutations on translationin vitro. A, schematic presentation of the upstream AUG mutants.

Open table in a new tab Based on the newly designed construct (pT7TS-Cx41-GFP-glob-A30C30) four different Cx41 constructs were made (see also Fig. 4 A). In each construct one or all upstream ATGs were mutated to AAG. Three subsequent PCRs were performed. In the first PCR the WT Cx41 clone was used as template and Cx41–5F3 and Cx41–5R1 as primers to create the two downstream AAG triplets. After the initial denaturation (5 min, 95 °C) 5 cycles were performed for denaturation (20 s, 95 °C), annealing (40 s, 34 °C), and elongation (40 s, 72 °C), followed by 35 cycles with an annealing temperature of 62 °C and a final elongation period of 10 min (72 °C). The resulting PCR product was isolated and used as reverse primer in the second PCR with Cx41-5F2. Annealing was performed at 44 and 72 °C respectively. The PCR product was then used as primer in a PCR with primer Cx41-5F1 at the same annealing temperatures, creating a fragment linked by aHindIII and an NcoI restriction site. This fragment was cloned into pT7TS. Clones with the desired mutation combinations were selected after sequencing. Plasmid DNA was linearized with BamHI and purified by phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol extraction and subsequent ethanol precipitation. Capped synthetic mRNA was generated using the mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion). The mRNA was deproteinized and purified on a Sephadex G-50 fine column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) followed by ethanol precipitation. Amount and integrity of the mRNA were checked by spectrophotometry and ethidium bromide-agarose gel electrophoresis. Equal amounts of transcript were translated in a reticulocyte lysate system in the presence of [35S]methionine (25Scheper G.C. Voorma H.O. Thomas A.A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7269-7274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Labeled proteins were separated on a 12.5% acrylamide gel and detected by exposure to Hyperfilm MP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Signals were quantified after overnight exposure to a PhosphorScreen and subsequently analyzed using a PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Small peptides were visualized after incorporation of labeled [35S]methionine/cysteine and separation on a Tris-Tricine acrylamide gel (26Schägger H. Von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10407) Google Scholar). X. laevis frogs were reared as described (27Wu M. Gerhart J. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 36: 3-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Female animals were injected with 800 IU human chorionic gonadotropin (Pregnyl, Organon) 16 h before use. The female animals were kept at 14 °C after injection. Males were injected twice with 400 IU human chorionic gonadotropin, once in the week prior to the experiment and once 16 h before use. Males were anesthetized on ice for at least 20 min. After decerebration, the testes were dissected, rinsed, and stored at 4 °C in 100% MMR (100 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 2 mmCaCl2 and 5 mm Hepes, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4). Immediately after squeezing the female frogs, the eggs were rinsed with tap water and fertilized with sperm squeezed out of a small piece of testis. Twenty minutes after fertilization the embryos were dejellied in 2% cysteine-HCl in tap water, pH 7.9. Embryos were reared in 3% Ficoll in 25% MMR at 18 °C and staged according to the normal table for X. laevis (28Nieuwkoop P.D. Faber J. Normal Table of Xenopus laevis (Daudin: A Systematical and Chronological Survey of the Development from the Fertilized Egg till the End of Metamorphosis). 2nd Ed. North-Holland Publishing Company, Amsterdam1967Google Scholar). Injection needles (GC150-TF10, Clark Electromedical Instruments) were pulled (micropipette puller, Sutter Instruments) and broken to a tip diameter of ∼10 μm. Needles were calibrated after injection of water into oil (PV830 Pneumatic Pico Pump, World Precision Instruments), measurement of the diameter of the droplet, and adjustment of the pressure. One-cell stage embryos were injected with 0.8–1 ng of RNA in 8–10 nl of water. Twenty four hours after fertilization the embryos were pooled, rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C for RNA or protein isolation. RNA was isolated with RNAzol B (Campro Scientific B.V.) according to the manufacturer's protocol with an extra centrifugation step after homogenization of the embryos. Northern blots were performed with 5 μg of total RNA per lane. RNA samples were glyoxylated to melt any secondary structure and analyzed on a sodium phosphate-buffered 1.5% agarose gel (29Van Oers M.M. Vlak J.M. Voorma H.O. Thomas A.A.M. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 2253-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). RNA was blotted on Hybond-N membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by capillary transfer and subsequently UV cross-linked to the blot. After at least 2 h at 65 °C in prehybridization solution (5× Denhardt's, 3× SSC, 0.1% SDS, 100 mg of dextran sulfate, and 50 μg of salmon sperm DNA per ml), a [32P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech)-labeled GFP probe (T7 Quick Prime kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added, and hybridization was performed overnight at 65 °C. The probe was purified by Sephadex G-50 fine filtration (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Excess probe was removed by washing in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature. Signal was detected by exposure of the blot to Hyperfilm MP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and quantified after overnight exposure to a PhosphorScreen, by using a PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Prior to hybridization to a XenopusHistone 3 (XH3) probe the blot was stripped by pouring boiling 1% SDS directly onto the blot. Proteins were isolated by resuspending the embryos in 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, and 0.1 mm EDTA (10 μl/embryo). After repeated freezing and thawing, the mixture was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min. Fat-free supernatant was transferred to a clean Eppendorf tube. This was repeated once to obtain a clear supernatant. Protein equivalent to one or three embryos was separated on a 12.5% acrylamide gel and blotted onto Hybond-P (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After Ponceau Red staining (0.2% in 1% acetic acid) the blot was cut into two parts just below the 40-kDa marker band. Both parts of the blot were blocked in 5% fat-free milk powder in PBS, 0.2% Tween for 1 h. The lower part was incubated with GFP antibody (CLONTECH, 1:100 in blocking solution), and the upper part was incubated with rat antibody raised against eIF4A (1:5000 in blocking solution), for 2 h at room temperature. After another incubation in blocking solution the blots were incubated with 5000-fold diluted peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. After washing in PBS, 0.1% Tween, the blot was developed with chemiluminescence before exposure to film. The amounts of protein were determined by using a densitometer and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). The quantification was confirmed by loading equal amounts of GFP protein on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subsequent analysis (results not shown). Translation efficiency was calculated by dividing the amount of GFP protein produced by the amount of injected GFP mRNA. The figures were corrected for the differences in loading, determined using the eIF4A antibody and the XH3 probe. Translation efficiency of the most efficient construct was set at 100%. The partial sequence of Cx41 cloned earlier (23Yoshizaki G. Patiño R. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 42: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) contains a 154-nucleotide 5′-UTR with three potential uORFs, the complete coding region (1146 nt), and a 3′-UTR of 2317 nucleotides. The potential uORFs in the 5′-UTR and the extremely long 3′-UTR suggest translational control of this messenger. A 5′-RACE PCR was performed to obtain the complete Cx41 5′-UTR. Eight clones were sequenced, and all clones contained a 5′-UTR of 174 nucleotides (Fig.1 A), slightly longer than the sequence reported before (23Yoshizaki G. Patiño R. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 42: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Presumably, the cDNA library clone resulted from incomplete reverse transcription of the mRNA (23Yoshizaki G. Patiño R. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 42: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The stability of the 5′-UTR and of the strongest hairpin within the leader were calculated for 18 °C, the breeding temperature ofXenopus embryos (30Zuker M. Methods Mol. Biol. 1994; 25: 267-294PubMed Google Scholar). The free energy (ΔG) of the complete 5′-UTR was −62 kcal/mol and that of the strongest hairpin −38 kcal/mol, corresponding to −34 and −21 kcal/mol at 37 °C. Structures with a free energy more than −50 kcal/mol (at 37 °C) are not a severe problem for the eukaryotic translational machinery (31Kozak M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2850-2854Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar,32Kozak M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5134-5142Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Therefore, the stability of the hairpins within this 5′-UTR is expected not to cause substantial translational repression. The 5′-UTR contains three upstream start codons, all followed by in frame stop codons (Fig. 1 B). The upstream open reading frames potentially encode three small peptides of 28, 8, and 6 amino acids (Fig. 1 C). These uORFs might have a function in translational control. None of the sequences around the uAUGs conform to the Xenopus consensus sequence (A/C)(A/C)A(A/C)(A/C)AUG(A/G) (33Brown C.M. Dalphin M.E. Stockwell P.A. Tate W.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3119-3123Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In contrast, the region around the start codon of the Cx41 open reading frame contains the best conserved nucleotides, i.e. the A at −3 and the G at +1 relative to the AUG (34Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4147) Google Scholar). To investigate the translational capacity of the Cx41 5′-UTR, constructs containing the 5′-UTR of either Cx41 or Xenopus β-globin, the ORF of the GFP reporter, and the 3′-UTR of β-globin were made (Fig.2 A). DNA was cut after the A30C30 sequence and used to make transcripts for in vivo and in vitro translation. Addition of the A30C30 tail supports stability and thereby translation of the transcript. 2A. W. van der Velden, unpublished results. The construct with the β-globin 5′-UTR was used as a positive control since this 5′-UTR enables very efficient translation of the downstream ORF (35Krieg P.A. Melton D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7057-7070Crossref PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar). The in vitro translation of these transcripts in the reticulocyte lysate system showed that the Cx41 5′-UTR was about 3-fold less efficient than the globin 5′-UTR construct (Fig. 2, Band C). This indicates that, despite the three uORFs, the Cx41 5′-UTR does not cause strong translational repression in vitro. Apparently, the reticulocyte system is relatively insensitive to the presence of three potential upstream initiation codons. The same constructs were injected into one-cell stage X. laevis embryos. In each embryo 0.8–1 ng mRNA was injected. This is the smallest amount of transcript resulting in a detectable amount of GFP with the wild-type Cx41 5′-UTR (data not shown). Injected embryos were pooled 24 h after fertilization (stage 13–14) for protein and RNA isolation. GFP protein production was visualized by Western blotting. The amount of GFP protein (Fig.3 A) was corrected for the amount of injected GFP mRNA (Fig. 3 C), whereas both signals were corrected for the loading controls (eIF4A andXenopus Histon 3, Fig. 3, B and D).In vivo translation efficiency of the Cx41 5′-UTR was only 2%, compared with the β-globin 5′-UTR. Apparently, the replacement of the efficient β-globin 5′-UTR for the Cx41 5′-UTR strongly reduces translation. The relative translation efficiencies were also analyzed 8 h after fertilization (stage 8–9). They appeared to be similar compared with 24 h after fertilization (data not shown). Since the uORFs were expected to be the cause of the translational repression, the uAUGs were mutated into AAG. To facilitate the analysis of the contribution of each individual start codon, four different constructs were made with either one or with all uAUGs mutated (Fig. 4 A). The translation efficiency of the transcripts with single mutations (Δ1, Δ2, and Δ3) was compared with the wild-type Cx41 5′-UTR (WT) and the triple mutant (Δ123) in reticulocyte lysate. In this assay, no remarkable differences were found (Fig. 4 B). The in vitro translation assay was also performed with a mixture of [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine and analyzed on Tris-Tricine gels to enable the visualization of small peptides (Fig.5). Three transcripts were analyzed as follows: the wild-type (WT), the single mutant Δ1, and the triple mutant (Δ123). Translation of the wild-type 5′-UTR produced a small peptide that migrated slightly slower than a 20-amino acid residue control peptide (2.3 kDa). No peptides were detected with the Δ1 and the Δ123 mutant transcripts. Therefore, the peptide produced was due to the presence of uAUG1. Note that the exposure times for GFP (16 h) and the peptide (2 weeks) were very different (Fig. 5). Even taking into account the number of cysteines and methionines in GFP and the 28-amino acid peptide, the amount of peptide formed was very low. The results are in agreement with the moderate translational repressionin vitro of the WT Cx41 5′-UTR compared with the globin 5′-UTR and with the lack of differences in in vitrotranslational capacities between the Cx41 mutants. Wild-type or mutant Cx41 transcripts were injected into one-cell stage Xenopus embryos. The embryos were pooled 24 h after fertilization. Extracts were made and analyzed for the amount of GFP protein and mRNA present at the time of harvesting. The amount of produced GFP protein was corrected for the amount of injected GFP mRNA and for loading differences (Fig.6). The translation efficiency of the triple mutant (Δ123) was remarkably high compared with the wild-type transcript. The efficiency of Δ123 was set at 100%. Only 1% of GFP was formed by the wild-type transcript. The mutation of the three uAUGs enhanced translation efficiency 82- (Δ1), 9- (Δ2), and 4-fold (Δ3) compared with the wild-type Cx41 5′-UTR. Calculation of the efficiency of translational repression by each AUG will be discussed in detail later. When the embryos were collected 8 h after fertilization the results were similar (data not shown). The results show that the presence of the uAUGs in the leader of Cx41 strongly represses translation of the downstream GFP ORF in young Xenopus embryos. One of the differences between the analyses of translation efficiency in reticulocyte lysate and analyses after injection of X. laevis embryos is the incubation temperature. The in vitro translation was performed at 30 °C, whereas the injected embryos were cultured at 18 °C. The results might reflect a difference in a temperature-dependent mechanism. For example, the secondary structure of an mRNA is dependent on temperature, and alteration in the secondary structure may influence recognition of uAUGs. To test whether the difference between thein vitro and in vivo results was the result of difference in temperature at which the analyses were done, the in vitro translation was performed at 18, 24, and 30 °C. The Cx41 WT and the Δ1 transcripts as well as the globin-GFP mRNA were analyzed (Fig. 7). Translation efficiency in reticulocyte lysate was strongly dependent on the temperature. However, at each temperature tested, the ratio of the translation efficiency of Cx41 WT, Δ1, and the globin 5′-UTR transcripts was similar (see also Fig. 2). The differences between in vitroand in vivo translation efficiencies were apparently not caused by a temperaturedependent recognition of the uAUGs. Therefore, the scanning rate and translation initi"
https://openalex.org/W1989429976,"Loop 52–72 of porcine fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase may play a central role in the mechanism of catalysis and allosteric inhibition by AMP. The loop pivots between different conformational states about a hinge located at residues 50 and 51. The insertion of proline separately at positions 50 and 51 reduces kcat by up to 3-fold, with no effect on the Km for fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. The Ka for Mg2+ in the Lys50→ Pro mutant increases ∼15-fold, whereas that for the Ala51 → Pro mutant is unchanged. Although these mutants retain wild-type binding affinity for AMP and the fluorescent AMP analog 2′(3′)-O-(trinitrophenyl)adenosine 5′-monophosphate, the Ki for AMP increases 8000- and 280-fold in the position 50 and 51 mutants, respectively. In fact, the mutation Lys50 → Pro changes the mechanism of AMP inhibition with respect to Mg2+ from competitive to noncompetitive and abolishes K+ activation. The Ki for fructose 2,6-bisphosphate increases ∼20- and 30-fold in the Lys50 → Pro and Ala51 → Pro mutants, respectively. Fluorescence from a tryptophan introduced by the mutation of Tyr57 suggests an altered conformational state for Loop 52–72 due to the proline at position 50. Evidently, the Pro50 mutant binds AMP with high affinity at the allosteric site, but the mechanism of allosteric regulation of catalysis has been disabled. Loop 52–72 of porcine fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase may play a central role in the mechanism of catalysis and allosteric inhibition by AMP. The loop pivots between different conformational states about a hinge located at residues 50 and 51. The insertion of proline separately at positions 50 and 51 reduces kcat by up to 3-fold, with no effect on the Km for fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. The Ka for Mg2+ in the Lys50→ Pro mutant increases ∼15-fold, whereas that for the Ala51 → Pro mutant is unchanged. Although these mutants retain wild-type binding affinity for AMP and the fluorescent AMP analog 2′(3′)-O-(trinitrophenyl)adenosine 5′-monophosphate, the Ki for AMP increases 8000- and 280-fold in the position 50 and 51 mutants, respectively. In fact, the mutation Lys50 → Pro changes the mechanism of AMP inhibition with respect to Mg2+ from competitive to noncompetitive and abolishes K+ activation. The Ki for fructose 2,6-bisphosphate increases ∼20- and 30-fold in the Lys50 → Pro and Ala51 → Pro mutants, respectively. Fluorescence from a tryptophan introduced by the mutation of Tyr57 suggests an altered conformational state for Loop 52–72 due to the proline at position 50. Evidently, the Pro50 mutant binds AMP with high affinity at the allosteric site, but the mechanism of allosteric regulation of catalysis has been disabled. fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase 6-P2, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate 6-P2, fructose 2,6-bisphosphate 2′(3′)-O-(trinitrophenyl)adenosine 5′-monophosphate Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (d-fructose-1,6-bisphosphate 1- phosphohydrase, EC3.1.3.11; FBPase)1 catalyzes the hydrolysis of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (Fru-1,6-P2) to Fru-6-P and Pi (for a review, see Refs. 1Benkovic S.T. de Maine M.M.

Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1987; 59: 45-82Google Scholar). FBPase is a tetramer of identical subunits (Mr = 37,000). Each subunit has binding sites for Fru-1,6-P2, Fru-2,6-P2, and metal ions (which, taken together, define the active site) and a distinct AMP-binding site (4Ke H. Zhang Y. Liang J.-Y. Lipscomb W.N.

A. 1990; 87: 5243-5247Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The two binding loci within the same subunit are 28 Å apart, lying for the most part in separate folding domains (called the AMP and Fru-1,6-P2 domains). The four subunits of the tetramer occupy the corners of a rectangle, labeled clockwise C1 through C4, starting with the upper left-hand corner (7Zhang Y. Liang J.-Y Huang S. Lipscomb W.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 609-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). FBPase exists in at least two conformational states, called R and T, which differ by a 17o rotation of the C1-C2 subunit pair with respect to the C3-C4 subunit pair about one of three intersecting 2-fold axes of the tetramer (7Zhang Y.

Chem. 1996; 271: 33301-33307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Loop 52–72 could play an important role in the allosteric mechanism of AMP inhibition, existing in at least two conformational states (9Choe J.-Y. Poland B.W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 33: 11441-11450Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 10Choe J.-Y. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8565-8574Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In the absence of AMP, the loop interacts with the active site (engaged loop conformation), positioning the side chain of an essential catalytic residue, Asp74 (9Choe J.-Y. Poland B.W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 33: 11441-11450Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 11Kurbanov F.T. Choe J.-Y. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17511-17516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The binding of AMP to its allosteric pocket putatively displaces the loop from the active site and stabilizes the disengaged loop conformation (9Choe J.-Y. Poland B.W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 33: 11441-11450Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 10Choe J.-Y. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8565-8574Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Subunits with disengaged loops evidently have reduced affinity for essential metal ions and, as a consequence, may be impaired with respect to catalysis. Mutations of conserved residues in Loop 52–72 have significant effects on catalysis and allosteric inhibition of catalysis by AMP (11Kurbanov F.T. Choe J.-Y. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17511-17516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The metabolic flux through FBPase is sensitive to prevailing levels of AMP and Fru-2,6-P2. AMP inhibits FBPase allosterically with a Hill coefficient of 2 (12Stone S.R. Fromm H.J. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 620-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 13Nimmo H.G. Tipton K.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 58: 567-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), whereas Fru-2,6-P2inhibits FBPase by direct ligation of the active site with a Hill coefficient of unity (1Benkovic S.T. de Maine M.M. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1982; 53: 45-82PubMed Google Scholar, 2Tejwani G.A. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1983; 54: 121-194PubMed Google Scholar, 3Van Schaftingen E. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1987; 59: 45-82Google Scholar). Inhibition of FBPase by AMP is nonlinear and noncompetitive with respect to Fru-1,6-P2, but nonlinear and competitive with respect to Mg2+ (6Ke H. Zhang Y. Liang J.-Y. Lipscomb W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5243-5247Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 14Lui F. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7401-7406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, inhibition of FBPase by Fru-2,6-P2 is linear and competitive with respect to Fru-1,6-P2 and noncompetitive with respect to Mg2+. Due to the equilibrium reaction catalyzed by adenylate kinase, concentrations of AMP in vivoare nearly constant under normal physiological conditions, whereas the concentration of Fru-2,6-P2 varies in response to extracellular regulators such as glucagon and epinephrine. Hence, Fru-2,6-P2 is the probable dynamic regulator of FBPase in vivo, but AMP still plays a significant role. Fru-2,6-P2 lowers the apparent inhibition constant for AMP at least 10-fold (15Pilkis S.J. El-Maghrabi R.M. McGrane M.M. Pilkis J. Claus T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3619-3622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by decreasing the koff of AMP (16Lui F. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9122-9128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Levels of AMP association with the allosteric sites of FBPase will then necessarily change in response to Fru-2,6-P2levels, even if the concentration of AMP in vivo is constant. AMP/Fru-2,6-P2 synergism may arise from the ability of each ligand to stabilize a common thermodynamic state of FBPase (disengaged Loop 52–72) through different mechanisms (9Choe J.-Y. Poland B.W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 33: 11441-11450Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). For Loop 52–72 to move between its various states, significant conformational change must occur in hinge elements at residues 50 and 51 and residues 71 and 72. The combined mutation of lysines 71 and 72 to methionine dramatically increases the Ki for AMP, presumably due to the stabilization of the R-state over the T-state conformer of FBPase (11Kurbanov F.T. Choe J.-Y. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17511-17516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). If the loop-mediated mechanism of AMP inhibition is valid, mutations at the second hinge element must qualitatively cause a similar increase in the Ki for AMP, yet mutations of Lys50 to methionine (17Shyur L.F. Poland B.W. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26295-26299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and glutamine and alanine (18Carcamo J.G. Yanez A.J. Ludwig H.C. Leon O. Pinto R.O. Reyes A.M. Slebe J.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2242-2251Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) cause virtually no change in the Ki for AMP. What is clear from crystal structures, however, is a large difference in main chain angles (φ, ϕ) at position 50 in the R- and T-states of FBPase (7Zhang Y. Liang J.-Y Huang S. Lipscomb W.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 609-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 9Choe J.-Y. Poland B.W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 33: 11441-11450Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 10Choe J.-Y. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8565-8574Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Here we explore the consequence of mutations Lys50 → Pro and Ala51 → Pro, which directly influence the backbone conformation of residues 50 and 51. The mutations have little effect on the binding affinity of a fluorescent analog of AMP, but increase the kinetic Ki value for that analog by several orders of magnitude. The kinetic Km value for Fru-1,6-P2 is unchanged by the mutations, but the Ka for Mg2+ rises 15-fold in the case of the Pro50 mutant and is 40-fold less active under standard conditions of assay. The data suggest that Loop 52–72 is an essential element in the allosteric mechanism of FBPase. Fru-1,6-P2, Fru-2,6-P2, NADP+, AMP, ampicillin, and isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside were purchased from Sigma. DNA-modifying and restriction enzymes, T4 polynucleotide kinase, and ligase were from Promega. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and phosphoglucose isomerase came from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Tryptone, yeast extract, and agar were from Difco. Other chemicals were of reagent grade or equivalent. Escherichia coli strains BMH71-18 mutS and XL1-Blue came from CLONTECH and Stratagene, respectively. FBPase-deficient strain DF657 came from the Genetic Stock Center at Yale University. Mutations were accomplished by specific base changes in double-stranded plasmid using the TransformerTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH). The mutagenic primers for the Lys50 → Pro, Ala51 → Pro, and Tyr57 → Trp mutants were 5′-GTCCGC CCG GCGGGCATC-3′, 5′-CCGCAAG CCG GGCATCGC-3′, and 5′-CGCACCTC TGG GGAATTG3′, respectively (codons for mutation are in boldface and underlined). The selection primer 5′-CAGCCTCGC CTCGAG AACGCCA-3′ (the digestion site is in boldface and underlined) changed an original NruI site on the plasmid into a XhoI site. The mutation and integrity of the gene were confirmed by sequencing the entire gene. The Iowa State University sequencing facility provided DNA sequences using the fluorescent dye dideoxy terminator method. Protein expression and purification were performed as described previously (11Kurbanov F.T. Choe J.-Y. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17511-17516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), but with minor alterations. After cell breakage, FBPase was enriched and concentrated by 70% ammonium sulfate fractionation. The precipitate was taken up in 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5) and desalted on a Sephadex G-100 column using 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5). The active fractions were loaded directly onto a Cibacron blue column and eluted with a 0.5–1 m NaCl gradient. FBPase eluted at ∼800 mm NaCl. The eluent was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), loaded onto a DEAE-Sephadex column, and then developed with a 0–300 mmNaCl gradient. FBPase eluted at a salt concentration of 150 mm, and its purity was confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207165) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay (20Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (216202) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. CD studies on wild-type and mutant FBPases were done at room temperature on a Jasco J710 CD spectrometer in a 1-cm cell using a protein concentration of 0.35 mg/ml. Spectra were collected from 200 to 260 nm in increments of 1.3 nm. Each spectrum was blank-corrected and smoothed using the software package provided with the instrument. Assays for the determination of specific activity, kcat, and activity ratios at pH 7.5 and 9.5 employed the coupling enzymes phosphoglucose isomerase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (1Benkovic S.T. de Maine M.M. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1982; 53: 45-82PubMed Google Scholar). The reduction of NADP+ to NADPH was monitored directly at 340 nm. All other assays employed the same coupling enzymes, but monitored NADPH evolution by its fluorescence emission at 470 nm (excitation wavelength of 340 nm). Initial rate data were analyzed using either programs written in the MINITAB language using an α value of 2.0 (14Lui F. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7401-7406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or ENZFITTER (21Leatherbarrow R.J. ENZFITTER: A Non-Linear Regression Data Analysis Program for the IBM PC. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1987: 13-75Google Scholar). The kinetic data were fit to a variety of models. Only models and parameters for the best fits are reported below. Fluorescence data were collected using an SLM 8100C fluorometer (Spectronic Instruments). The single tryptophan in the Trp57 mutant was excited selectively using radiation of 295-nm wavelength. Fluorescence emission spectra were recorded in steps of 1 nm from 310 to 400 nm using a slit width of 2 mm for both excitation and emission. Each spectrum was an average of five scans. Fluorescence from TNP-AMP employed excitation and emission wavelengths of 400 and 535 nm, respectively. Conditions under which specific spectra were recorded are provided below and in the tables and figure legends. Each point is the average of 15 1-s acquisitions. Enzyme concentrations ranged from 0.3 to 0.5 μm. All spectra were corrected for dilution and inner filter effects (absorbance of light by AMP and TNP-AMP) using Equation1 (22Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York1999: 52-54Google Scholar), Fc=(F−B)(Vi/V0)10(Aex+Aem)/2Equation 1 where Fc is the corrected fluorescence,F is the fluorescence intensity experimentally measured,B is the background, Vi is the volume of the sample for a specific titration point, V0 is the initial volume of the sample, Aex is the absorbance measured at the wavelength of excitation (295 nm for AMP and 410 nm for TNP-AMP), and Aem is the absorbance measured at the wavelength of emission (535 nm for TNP-AMP). As a control, ligands by themselves caused no change in fluorescence emission from a solution of tryptophan (100 μm). TNP-AMP titration data were analyzed by nonlinear least-squares fits using Equation 2, ΔFFo=(ΔFmax/F0)·LnKd+LnEquation 2 where ΔF is the change in fluorescence caused by the addition of ligand (L), F0 is the fluorescence in the absence of ligand, ΔFmaxis the theoretical maximum change in fluorescence at saturating ligand concentration, Kd is the dissociation constant, and n is the Hill coefficient. The starting model for the engaged conformation of Loop 52–72 is the crystal structure of the Zn2+·product complex of FBPase (PDB accession code 1CNQ), in which the tetramer assumes the R-state conformation (9Choe J.-Y. Poland B.W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 33: 11441-11450Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The starting model for the disengaged conformation of Loop 52–72 is a Zn2+·product·AMP complex of FBPase, in which the tetramer has the T-state conformation (10Choe J.-Y. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8565-8574Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The latter structure is similar to other T-state structures of FBPase (7Zhang Y. Liang J.-Y Huang S. Lipscomb W.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 609-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 23Xue Y. Huang S. Liang J.-Y Lipscomb W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12482-12486Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), differing primarily in the ligands present at the active site. Proline residues were placed individually at positions 50 and 51 using the software XTALVIEW and a Silicon Graphics workstation. The initial models were passed through three protocols: 1) 100 cycles of conjugate gradient minimization; 2) 100 cycles of conjugate gradient minimization, followed by simulated annealing (starting temperature, 500 K; final temperature, 300 K) (24Brünger A.T. XPLOR , Version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar) and then another 100 cycles of conjugate gradient minimization; and 3) the same procedure as Protocol 2, but using a starting temperature of 1000 K. During simulated annealing and energy minimization, the Cα atoms (except for residues 50–72) were restrained to their initial crystallographic positions by a harmonic pseudo-potential with a force constant of 50 kcal/mol. The justification for restraining all Cα atoms outside of the loop is the 10-year history of FBPase crystal structures, which collectively reveal only small changes in the protein conformation outside of Loop 52–72. A structural overview of the region of interest is provided in Fig. 1. The main chain φ angle of Lys50 differs significantly in the T- and R-states, neither value being compatible with that of proline, where φ must be close to −60°. Insertion of proline then results in an initial model with poor stereochemistry at position 50. Energy minimization alone and energy minimization with simulated annealing at a starting temperature of 500 K (Protocols 1 and 2 in “Experimental Procedures”) leave the φ angle of Pro50some 30° away from its preferred value in both the T- and R-states. Further improvement in the stereochemistry of Pro50requires a starting temperature of 1000 K in simulated annealing (Protocol 3), the consequence of which is a significant drift of the Loop 52–72 away from either its T- or R-state conformation. Evidently, proline at position 50 is incompatible with the T-state disengaged and R-state engaged loop conformations. Proline at position 51, on the other hand, is less disruptive. The φ angle of residue 51 is near −60° in both the R- and T-states of FBPase. Backbone amide 51 hydrogen bonds with backbone carbonyls 47 and 48 in the R-state and with backbone carbonyl 46 in the T-state. Proline substitution at position 51 clearly disrupts the hydrogen bonds in both the R- and T-states. Moreover, the Cδatom of proline makes close contacts of 1.9 and 1.8 Å with backbone carbonyls 48 (R-state) and 46 (T-state), respectively. Either energy minimization alone or energy minimization with simulated annealing (initial temperature, 500 K) relaxes the contact in the R-state (the loop remains engaged with the active site) by a 90° rotation of the plane of the polypeptide linkage between residues 47 and 48. The close contact of the T-state remains, however, at 2.4 and 2.8 Å after modeling Protocols 1 and 2, respectively. Contacts from within the subunit and from the neighboring subunit constrain the T-state conformation of residues 52–57 (Fig. 1). Furthermore, as backbone carbonyl 46 is an integral part of helix H2, it cannot relieve its close contact with Pro51 by a rotation of its polypeptide linkage. Hence, proline at position 51 probably increases the internal energy of the T-state, destabilizing it relative to the R-state of FBPase. Mutant and wild-type FBPases behaved identically throughout purification, including gel exclusion chromatography. The wild-type and mutant enzymes were at least 95% pure with no evidence for proteolysis on the basis of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The CD spectra of wild-type FBPase in the T- and R-states diverge minimally, but reproducibly in the vicinity of 210 nm (17Shyur L.F. Poland B.W. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26295-26299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The CD spectra of the Ala51→ Pro, Lys50 → Pro/Tyr57 → Trp, and wild-type FBPases superimpose in the presence of Pi (5 mm), Fru-6-P (5 mm), and saturating Mg2+ (5 mm for the wild-type and Ala51 → Pro enzymes and 35 mm for Lys50 → Pro/Tyr57 → Trp). The addition of AMP (200 μm) to the wild-type enzyme produced small changes in the CD spectrum near 210 nm, as noted above, but caused no change in the CD spectra of the Lys50 → Pro/Tyr57 → Trp and Ala51 → Pro enzymes. (Concentrations of AMP in excess of 200 μm degraded CD spectra due to the elevated absorbance of radiation.) The CD spectra of the Lys50 → Pro mutant also differ from the corresponding wild-type spectra (Fig. 2). The CD spectrum of the Lys50 → Pro mutant did not change in the presence of Pi (5 mm), Fru-6-P (5 mm), and saturating Mg2+ (50 mm) in the presence or absence of AMP (200 μm). Initial rate kinetics employ maximal substrate concentrations, sufficient to saturate the active site, but low enough to avoid substrate inhibition. The ratios of catalytic rate constants at pH 7.5 and 9.6 are comparable for wild-type and Ala51 → Pro FBPases (TableI), both consistent with reported activity ratios for an FBPase free of proteolysis. The activity ratios for the Lys50 → Pro and Lys50 → Pro/Tyr57 → Trp mutants are low, however; but as discussed below, the low value does not stem from limited proteolysis of that mutant.Table IKinetic parameters for wild-type and mutant forms of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase7.5/9.5 ratioSpecific activity1-aSpecific activity was determined at 5 mm Mg2+ and 20 μmFru-1,6-P2.kcat1-bkcat is defined as Vmax/ET , where ET is the total enzyme concentration.Km for Fru-1,6-P2Ka for Mg2+Hill for Mg2+Ki for Fru-2,6-P2IC50 for AMP1-cThe Hill coefficient for AMP ligation of high affinity sites is 2.

Open table in a new tab All enzymes have comparable Km values for Fru-1,6-P2 (Table I); but beyond this, the quantitative similarities end. Under standard conditions of assay for the wild-type enzyme (5 mm Mg2+ and 20 μmFru-1,6-P2, pH 7.5), the mutation of Lys50 to proline resulted in a 40-fold loss of specific activity. However, the decline in specific activity was due primarily to a 15-fold increase in the Ka for Mg2+ for the Pro50 mutant. The kcat value for the Pro50 mutant (saturated with Mg2+) is one-third of that for the wild-type enzyme. The Hill coefficients for Mg2+ for the Ala51 → Pro, Lys50→ Pro/Tyr57 → Trp, and wild-type enzymes are similar, but are reduced significantly in the Lys50 → Pro mutant. Potassium ion activation is retained in the Ala51 → Pro and Lys50 → Pro/Tyr57 → Trp mutants at levels comparable to that of the wild-type enzyme, but is abolished altogether in the Pro50 mutant. Concentrations of AMP needed for 50% inhibition increased 280-, 8000-, and 400-fold relative to that of the wild-type enzyme for the Ala51 → Pro, Lys50 → Pro, and Lys50 → Pro/Tyr57 → Trp mutants, respectively (Fig.3 and Table I). Additionally, the Lys50 → Pro/Tyr57 → Trp double mutant displays biphasic behavior toward AMP. The data of Fig. 3 for the wild-type, Ala51 → Pro, and Lys50 → Pro enzymes were fit to Equation 3, v=V01+IIC502Equation 3 where v is the observed velocity at a specific concentration of AMP, V0 is the fitted velocity in the absence of AMP, I is the concentration of AMP, and IC50 is the concentration of AMP that causes 50% inhibition. The exponent of 2 represents the Hill coefficient for AMP cooperativity, determined independently as described below. The data of Fig. 3 for Lys50 → Pro/Tyr57 → Trp FBPase were fit to Equation 4, v=V01+IIC50­high2+IIC50­lownEquation 4 where v, V0, and I are as defined above for Equation 3 and IC50-high and IC50-low represent concentrations of AMP that cause 50% relative inhibition due to the ligation of high and low affinity sites, respectively. Ligation of the high affinity sites, as shown below, is cooperative with a Hill coefficient of 2, whereas the cooperativity with respect to the ligation of low affinity sites is an adjustable parameter (n) in Equation 4. The fitted value for n is 1.4. AMP inhibition of wild-type FBPase is nonlinear and noncompetitive with respect to Fru-1,6-P2 and nonlinear and competitive with respect to Mg2+. The Ala51 → Pro mutant retains the nonlinear, competitive relationship between AMP and Mg2+ (goodness-of-fit, 5.5%) (Fig.4), consistent with Equation 5, 1v=1Vm1+KaA21+InKiEquation 5 where v, Vm , A, I,Ka , Ki , and nrepresent initial velocity, maximal velocity, Mg2+concentration, AMP concentration, the Michaelis constant for Mg2+, the dissociation constant for AMP from the enzyme·AMP complex, and the Hill coefficient for AMP, respectively. The binding of AMP is cooperative at n = 2, whereas cooperativity is absent when n = 1. Data from the wild-type and Ala51 → Pro enzymes are consistent with n = 2 (AMP cooperativity). When assayed at low AMP concentrations, Lys50 → Pro/Tyr57 → Trp retains the competitive mechanism with n = 2. In contrast, AMP inhibition of the Lys50 → Pro mutant fits best to a mechanism of noncompetitive inhibition with respect to Mg2+ (goodness-of-fit, 3.1%) (Fig. 4), represented by Equation 6, 1v=1Vm1+1nKii+KaA1+InKiEquation 6 where the terms of Equation 6 are defined as for Equation 5 and Kii represents the dissociation constant for AMP from the enzyme·Mg2+·AMP complex. The data are consistent with n = 2, reflecting AMP cooperativity. In wild-type, Ala51 → Pro, and Lys50 → Pro/Tyr57 → Trp FBPases, the mechanism of AMP inhibition with respect to Fru-1,6-P2 is nonlinear and noncompetitive (Equation 7), 1v=1Vm1+InKii+KbB1+InKiEquation 7 where v, Vm , I, and n are as defined above, Ki and Kii represent the dissociation constants for AMP from the enzyme·AMP and the enzyme·Fru-1,6-P2·AMP complexes, respectively, B is the concentration of Fru-1,6-P2, and Kb is the Michaelis constant for Fru-1,6-P2. The high value for IC50 associated with AMP inhibition of the Lys50 → Pro mutant (Table I) precludes the determination of a kinetic mechanism. Fru-2,6-P2 is a competitive inhibitor with respect to Fru-1,6-P2 for the position 50 and 51 mutant FBPases. The data best fit to Equation 8 (goodness-of-fit, 4.0%), 1v=1Vm1+KbB1+IKiEquation 8 where v, Vm , I, B,Ki , and Kb are as defined above. The kinetic mechanism of Fru-2,6-P2 inhibition is the same for mutant and wild-type FBPases, but the Ki for Fru-2,6-P2 is ∼20-, 30-, and 3-fold higher in the Lys50 → Pro, Ala51 → Pro, and Lys50 → Pro/Tyr57 → Trp mutants, respectively, relative to the wild-type enzyme (Table I). AMP and Fru-2,6-P2 synergistically inhibited wild-type and mutant FBPases (Fig. 5). For all enzymes, the Hill coefficient for AMP is 2. At high concentrations of Fru-2,6-P2, the saturation curve for Fru-1,6-P2changes from hyperbolic to sigmoidal for mutant and wild-type enzymes. TNP-AMP inhibited the wild-type enzyme competitively with respect to Mg2+ and inhibited FBPase synergistically with Fru-2,6-P2. Fluorescence emission from TNP-AMP increased significantly in the presence of FBPase. In addition, AMP reduced the fluorescence from bound TNP-AMP, presumably through competition for the allosteric effector site (data not shown). TNP-AMP bound to wild-type, Lys50 → Pro, and Ala51 → Pro FBPases with high affinity, comparable to AMP. On the basis of fluorescence titration data (Table II), however, the Hill coefficient for TNP-AMP is near unity in all cases.Table IIInhibition and binding constants for TNP-AMP for wild-type and mutant forms of fructose-1,6-bisphosphataseIC50 for TNP-AMPKd for TNP-AMPμmμmWild-type7.4 ± 0.713.1 ± 0.6Lys50 → ProND2-aNot determined due to weak inhibition by TNP-AMP.14 ± 4Ala51 → ProND37 ± 22-a Not determined due to weak inhibition by TNP-AMP. Open table in a new tab FBPase has no tryptophan, so the mutation of any single residue to tryptophan introduces a unique fluorophore. Fluorescence emission from tryptophan at position 57 is sensitive to the conformational state of Loop 52–72. The indole of Trp57 is exposed to solvent in the T-state disengaged loop conformation, whereas it resides in a hydrophobic pocket in the R-state engaged loop conformation. The Tyr57 → Trp mutant has been thoroughly studied by x-ray crystallography and initial velocity kinetics (25Nelson, S. W., Iancu, C. V., Choe, J.-Y., Honzatko, R. B., and Fromm, H. J. (2000) Biochemistry, in pressGoogle Scholar). Fluorescence emission spectra from the Pro50/Trp57 double mutant differ significantly from those of the Trp57 single mutant (Fig. 6). Fluorescence emission from the single Trp57 mutant is maximum in the presence of products/metals, conditions that promote the R-state engaged loop conformation (9Choe J.-Y. Poland B.W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 33: 11441-11450Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 10Choe J.-Y. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8565-8574Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The addition of AMP reduced fluorescence emission to a level comparable to that observed from the Trp57mutant in the absence of products and metals (apo form of FBPase). In contrast, the apo form of the Pro50/Trp57double mutant has the highest fluorescence emission. The addition of either product/metals or product/metals/AMP caused only a decrease in fluorescence emission. Low activity ratios (∼0.3) are a property of wild-type FBPase after limited proteolysis by papain or subtilisin (26Horecker B.L. Melloni E. Pontremoli S. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1975; 42: 193-226PubMed Google Scholar). The maximum effect on the activity ratio due to proteolysis occurs when one subunit per tetramer is cut. Thus, for the wild-type enzyme, an activity ratio of 1, as observed for the Lys50 → Pro mutant, requires an equal mixture of intact and once-proteolyzed tetramers. Proteolysis of one of eight subunits then could account for a diminished activity ratio in any FBPase. In SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the Lys50 → Pro mutant, however, no fragments typical of proteolysis were evident. Furthermore, loss of AMP inhibition due to proteolysis of wild-type FBPase varied proportionately with the extent of subunit cleavage. The 8000-fold increase in Ki for AMP far exceeds the effect on AMP inhibition due to proteolysis, even in a completely proteolyzed system. Hence, the kinetic properties of the Lys50 → Pro mutant are not the consequence of proteolysis, but rather the influence of a proline at position 50. Allosteric inhibition of wild-type FBPase by TNP-AMP is essentially identical to that caused by AMP, the only difference being the absence of cooperativity in the kinetics and in the binding of the fluorescent analog. In fact, TNP-AMP is indistinguishable from formycin 5′-monophosphate in its inhibition and binding to wild-type FBPase. Formycin 5′-monophosphate also exhibits a Hill coefficient of unity (27Scheffler J.E. Fromm H.J. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 6659-6665Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and crystal structures of complexes of formycin 5′-monophosphate and AMP with human FBPase are identical (28Iverson L.F. Brzozowski M. Hastrup S. Hubbard R. Kastup J.S. Larsen I.K. Naerum L. Norsko-Lauridsen L. Rasmussen P.B. Thim L. Wiberg F.C. Lundgren K. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 971-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The difference in Hill coefficient may stem from subtle differences in conformation, evident perhaps only in partially ligated states of FBPase. Nonetheless, the fluorescence data clearly demonstrate tight binding of TNP-AMP and the displacement of that analog from FBPase by the addition of AMP. Hence, wild-type and Pro50 mutant FBPases are indistinguishable in their binding of TNP-AMP and its displacement by AMP. On the basis of kinetics, however, Pro50 mutant FBPase is altogether insensitive to AMP. Inhibition of the Pro50mutant by AMP requires an 8000-fold increase in ligand concentration and exhibits a different kinetic mechanism (noncompetitive versus competitive with respect to Mg2+). The apparent change in kinetic mechanism may arise from the unmasking of a secondary mechanism, due to the complete loss of allosteric inhibition by AMP. That secondary mechanism may be the direct coordination of AMP to the metal-ligated active site of Pro50 mutant FBPase. Hence, if AMP binds tightly to the Pro50 mutant, as evidenced by the fluorescence data, but does not inhibit, then proline at position 50 must interrupt the transmission of the allosteric signal. Kinetic data indicate the disruption of Loop 52–72 as the root cause for the loss of allosteric properties in Pro50 mutant FBPase. The Ka for Mg2+ is elevated 15-fold in the Pro50 mutant, and K+ activation is lost. The kinetic mechanism of AMP inhibition with respect to Mg2+ is competitive in wild-type FBPase. Hence, in wild-type FBPase, AMP elevates the apparent dissociation constant of metals. A greatly elevated Ka for Mg2+, accompanied by the complete loss of AMP inhibition, is consistent with an FBPase unable to achieve its high affinity state for metal cations. On the basis of recent crystal structures (10Choe J.-Y. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8565-8574Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), the R-state engaged conformation of Loop 52–72 represents the high affinity state for metal cations and the catalytically productive state of FBPase. Pro50 mutant FBPase then cannot achieve a engaged loop conformation. Molecular modeling, CD spectroscopy, and fluorescence emission from Trp57 strengthen the argument above. The mutation of Lys50 to proline destabilizes the R-state engaged loop and T-state disengaged loop conformations in slow cooling/energy minimization protocols. The CD spectrum of Pro50 mutant FBPase supports an altered state, conformationally unresponsive to the binding of ligands. The indole group of Trp57 in the Pro50/Trp57 double mutant does not enter its hydrophobic pocket, as evidenced by the low fluorescence emission in the presence of saturating products/metals. The several lines of evidence provided here suggest that Loop 52–72 in Pro50mutant FBPase can achieve neither its T-state disengaged nor its R-state engaged loop conformation. The complete loss of allosteric inhibition in Pro50 mutant FBPase suggests furthermore, that Loop 52–72 is an essential element in the allosteric regulation of FBPase. The effects of the Ala51 → Pro mutation are less dramatic, in harmony with the results of modeling and CD spectroscopy. The Pro51 mutant retains K+ activation and wild-type affinity for divalent cations, but exhibits a significant increase in the Ki for AMP. The mutation evidently destabilizes the T-state disengaged conformation of Loop 52–72 relative to the R-state engaged conformation, again consistent with the results of modeling. In this respect, the Pro51 mutant and the Met71/72 double mutant (11Kurbanov F.T. Choe J.-Y. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17511-17516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) have similar effects on FBPase function. In both instances, lessened AMP inhibition probably arises from a perturbation in the equilibrium between engaged and disengaged loop conformations in favor of the engaged state. The Ki for Fru-2,6-P2 increases 20- and 30-fold in the Lys50 → Pro and Ala51 → Pro mutants, respectively. The change in binding affinity for Fru-2,6-P2 in these mutants must be indirect and is most likely through a perturbation of conformation states accessible to Loop 52–72. The increase in Ki for Fru-2,6-P2 due to loop mutations does not come with an increase in the Km for Fru-1,6-P2, as has been observed in other mutations that increase the Ki for Fru-2,6-P2 (29Shyur L.F. Zhang R. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 123-127Google Scholar). The observation above is consistent with findings that suggest that Fru-2,6-P2 and Fru-1,6-P2, although binding at the same site, evoke different conformational responses from FBPase. For instance, at high concentrations of Fru-2,6-P2, the Hill coefficient for AMP inhibition changes from 2 to 1, and the saturation curve for Fru-1,6-P2 changes from hyperbolic to sigmoidal (3Van Schaftingen E. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1987; 59: 45-82Google Scholar, 30Schaftingen E.V. Hers H.-G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 2861-2863Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). At low concentrations of Fru-2,6-P2, the Hill coefficient for Mg2+ changes from 2 to 1 (31Pilkis S.J. El-Maghrabi R.M. McGrane M.M. Pilkis J. Claus T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11489-11495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, Fru-2,6-P2 protects FBPase from loss of AMP inhibition and catalytic activity due to modification by acetylimidazole, whereas Fru-1,6-P2 protects only against loss of activity (31Pilkis S.J. El-Maghrabi R.M. McGrane M.M. Pilkis J. Claus T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11489-11495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although a complete understanding of the above phenomena will come with further study, mutations of the loop underscore a fundamental difference in FBPase in its Fru-2,6-P2- and Fru-1,6-P2-ligated states.

N-ethylmaleimide dithiothreitol polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Many bacteria rotate flagellar filaments to swim. The flagellar filament is attached via a flexible hook to a protein complex termed the basal body, which is embedded in the cell surface. The motor is composed of the basal body and the C ring (rotor), whereas the multiple torque-generating units of the stator surround the rotor (1Aizawa S.I. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The motor is driven by the flow of specific ions (H+or Na+) through the stator, and mechanical force is presumably generated at the stator-rotor interface (2Imae Y. Atsumi T. J. Bioenerg.

Of these, PomA and PomB are similar to MotA and MotB, respectively. It has been inferred that PomA and PomB also form an ion channel (8Asai Y. Kojima S. Kato H. Nishioka N. Kawagishi I. Homma M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5104-5110Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). This inference was supported by the observation that mutations conferring resistance to phenamil, which is a known Na+-channel inhibitor and specifically and strongly inhibits the Na+-driven motor, mapped to pomA andpomB (14Jaques S. Kim Y.K. McCarter L.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5740-5745Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 16Kojima S. Atsumi T. Muramoto K. Kudo S. Kawagishi I. Homma M. J. Mol.

The mutations occurred at Asp-148 of PomA and Pro-16 of PomB, which are near the cytoplasmic ends of putative transmembrane segments. The D148Y and P16S mutations combined to produce a synergistic increase in resistance to phenamil and impaired motor function much more severely than the individual mutations in the absence of inhibitor (17Kojima S. Asai Y. Atsumi T. Kawagishi I. Homma M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1537-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We have also shown that PomA and PomB physically interact with each other (18Yorimitsu T. Sato K. Asai Y. Kawagishi I. Homma M. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5103-5106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and that Na+influx can be detected in reconstituted proteoliposomes containing purified PomA/PomB complex (19Sato K. Homma M. J. Biol.

The molar ratio of the isolated complex is calculated to be 2PomA/1PomB, and PomA seems to form a stable dimer. To characterize the molecular architecture of PomA, we carried out Cys-scanning mutagenesis (20Asai Y. Shoji T. Kawagishi I. Homma M. J.

In PomA, periplasmic loops are predicted for residues Val-21 through Leu-36 between transmembrane segments 1 and 2 (loop1–2) and for residues Ser-167 through Ala-180 between transmembrane segments 3 and 4 (loop3–4) (Fig. 1). Each residue in these loops has been substituted with Cys. Except for A174C, all Cys substitutions from M169C to M179C in loop3–4impaired motility, whereas only the D31C substitutions in loop1–2 significantly impaired motility. The motility of some Cys mutants was inhibited by the thiol-modifying reagents 5,5′-dithiobis(nitrobenzoic acid) and NEM.1 The inhibition profiles of these reagents were consistent with the membrane topology predicted from the hydrophobicity profiles (20Asai Y.

Biol. 1999; 285: 1537-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To introduce the P172A, P172I, and P172S substitutions into PomA, we used a two-step polymerase chain reaction method described previously (17Kojima S. Asai Y. Atsumi T. Kawagishi I. Homma M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1537-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We synthesized pairs of mutant primers homologous to either the sense or antisense strand of the pomA gene, with a 1–3-base mismatch at the mutation site. In addition to these primers, we used end primers and amplified the full gene. This fragment was cloned into pSU41, and the identity of the total insert was confirmed by DNA sequencing. An overnight culture in VC medium was spotted onto VPG plates containing 0.25% agar and 100 μg/ml kanamycin and incubated at 30 °C. Dithiothreitol (DTT) was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, as needed. Cells were harvested at late logarithmic phase and suspended in V-buffer (25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 300 mm NaCl). The cell suspension was diluted 100-fold in V-buffer, and motility of the cells were observed at room temperature under a dark field microscope and recorded on video tape. Swimming speed was determined as described previously (25Homma M. Oota H. Kojima S. Kawagishi I. Imae Y. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 2777-2783Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). If necessary, DTT was added to V-buffer at a final concentration of 1 mm. VIO586 (PomA−) cells producing wild-type or various Cys-PomA mutant proteins were cultured in VPG medium and collected by centrifugation at mid-log phase. Cells were washed with V-buffer and then resuspended in the same buffer or in V-buffer containing 10 mm DTT or 1 mmCuCl2. After 30 min of incubation at room temperature, the cells were collected, washed with V-buffer containing 2 mm N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), suspended in the same buffer, and then incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Next, an equal volume of 15% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid was added to the cell suspension, and the resulting precipitate was washed once with acetone, dried, and then dissolved in SDS sample buffer without reducing reagent. This sample was subjected to 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) followed by immunoblotting with antibody against PomA, as described previously (18Yorimitsu T. Sato K. Asai Y. Kawagishi I. Homma M. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5103-5106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). VIO586 cells producing wild-type or P172C PomA were grown in VPG medium to mid-log phase. The culture (80 ml) was centrifuged, and the cells were washed and suspended in V-buffer to an optical density at 660 nm of 10. After the cells were sonicated, the cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. The resulting precipitate (membrane fraction) was resuspended in V-buffer containing 10 mm DTT, and this suspension was incubated at room temperature. After 30 min, it was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C, the precipitate was resuspended in 500 μl of V-buffer containing 0.5 mm[14C]NEM (20 μCi/ml; NEN Life Science Products), and the resuspended material was incubated for 60 min at room temperature. The membrane fraction was recovered by centrifugation at 100,000 × g, solubilized with TNET buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 1% (w/v) Triton X-100), and incubated for 60 min at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitation with anti-PomA antibody was carried out as described previously (18Yorimitsu T. Sato K. Asai Y. Kawagishi I. Homma M. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5103-5106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting precipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by fluorography. Asai et al. (20Asai Y. Shoji T. Kawagishi I. Homma M. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 1001-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) carried out Cys-scanning mutagenesis of the two periplasmic loops (loop1–2 and loop3–4) of PomA and characterized the mutant proteins. This work showed that Cys replacements in loop3–4 affected motility more severely than those in loop1–2, and we therefore focused on the replacements in loop3–4. When we examined Cys-PomA proteins in loop3–4 by immunoblotting in the absence of reducing reagent, we observed, in addition to the 25-kDa PomA band, a 43-kDa band with Cys replacements at residues 171–174 and at residue 177 (Fig. 2 B). The intensity of the 43-kDa band was greatest with the P172C protein. When cells were treated with DTT and immunoblotting was carried out, only the 25-kDa PomA band was observed (Fig. 2 A). When the cells were treated with CuCl2, the intensity of the 43-kDa band was greatly enhanced with the Cys mutant proteins, and the intensity of the 25-kDa PomA band was correspondingly reduced (Fig. 2 C). The 43-kDa band was never observed with wild-type PomA, which contains no cysteine residues. To examine whether the 43-kDa band results from the Cys substitution and to test whether formation of the 43-kDa protein affects motor function, we constructed three additional Pro-172 mutants, P172A, P172I, and P172S. The motility of a pomA null mutant expressing any of these three PomA proteins was the same as that seen with wild-type PomA (Fig. 3 A). In all three mutants, the 43-kDa band observed with P172C PomA was absent under all conditions tested (Fig. 3 B). Motility was more affected by Cys substitutions near residue Pro-172 than at other positions in the loop regions (20Asai Y. Shoji T. Kawagishi I. Homma M. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 1001-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The P172C mutant produced swarms only after prolonged incubation, and motile cells were seldom observed in liquid culture (data not shown). We predicted that the inhibition of motility is caused by disulfide-bound formation between PomA subunits. The residual motility is probably due to incomplete cross-linking (see below). To examine this possibility, motility was assessed on swarm plates in the presence or absence of DTT (Fig.4 A). DTT did not affect swarming of cells expressing wild-type PomA, but cells producing P172C PomA swarmed well only in the presence of DTT (Fig. 4 A). This result suggests that motility is restored by reductive cleavage of the disulfide cross-link between Cys-PomA molecules. We next tested for dominant-negative effects of the cross-linked form of PomA. When P172C PomA was produced in wild-type cells (VIO5) on agar plates without DTT, motility was significantly reduced (Fig. 4 B). However, motility was restored in the presence of DTT. These results suggest that the cross-linked forms can be assembled into the motor complex. To examine the relationship between recovery of motility and reduction of the cross-linked PomA further, we measured the swimming speed of cells in the presence of DTT and the amount of the cross-linked PomA in the cells (Fig. 5). The swimming speed of the cells with wild-type PomA did not change in the presence or absence of DTT, showing a result consistent with the swarming assay. The cells producing PomA P172C did not swim in the absence of DTT. On the other hand, in the presence of DTT, the swimming speed of the cells gradually increased with time. After 30 min, the swimming speed of the cells producing PomA P172C recovered to about 40% compared with that of the cells with wild-type PomA (Fig. 5 A). We observed a concomitant decrease in the amount of cross-linked PomA and an increase in the amount of monomeric PomA protein with time. Immediately after DTT was added, the amount of the cross-linked PomA relative to total PomA in the cell was estimated to be about 80%. However, after 30 min in the presence of DTT, the amount of the cross-linked PomA decreased to only 25% of the total. Thus, the defect in motor function correlated with the amount of cross-linked PomA in the cell. We sought to eliminate the possibility that cross-linking occurs during the isolation of proteins after cell lysis. NEM, which is a thiol group-specific reagent whose reaction is irreversible, was used to quench disulfide bond formation. Cells producing Cys-PomA were treated with DTT, then with NEM, and finally with CuCl2, and immunoblotting was carried out with anti-PomA antibody (Fig.6). Without DTT treatment, a decrease of the 43-kDa band in the P172C and K173C mutants was observed after the addition of NEM, and the band disappeared completely in the I175C mutant. When the cells were treated with both DTT and NEM, the 43-kDa band was significantly reduced in the P172C mutant and disappeared completely in the other two mutants. These results suggest that the disulfide bond is cleaved with DTT and that the cleaved Cys residue is modified with NEM, so that formation of the 43-kDa band upon oxidation with CuCl2 is inhibited. To examine whether P172C PomA is modified directly by NEM, the membrane fraction of cells producing either wild-type or mutant PomA was prepared and treated with DTT followed by [14C]NEM treatment. Labeled 25-kDa PomA, immunoprecipitated with anti-PomA antibody, was detected with the P172C mutant but not with the wild type (data not shown). This finding demonstrates that NEM directly modifies the thiol group of Cys in the P172C PomA protein. We wanted to establish that the 43-kDa protein is a cross-linked product of two Cys-PomA molecules and not PomA cross-linked to another protein. Membrane fractions were prepared from cells producing wild-type or P172C PomA and lysed with 1% (w/v) Triton X-100. Proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-PomA antibody, and the precipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE carried out with or without DTT and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Fig. 7). In the absence of DTT, the 25-kDa band or the 43-kDa band was detected with wild-type or P172C PomA, respectively. These bands were not detected in a control in which PomA was not produced although an unknown band above the 43-kDa band was detected. In the presence of DTT, only the 25-kDa form was detected with either wild-type or P172C PomA and the intensities of the bands were similar to the corresponding bands in the absence of DTT. In all lanes in the presence of DTT, the bands with a molecular mass of about 50 kDa are the heavy chains of IgG. These results suggest that the 43-kDa band is composed entirely of cross-linked dimers between two Cys-PomA molecules. The PomA protein of the Na+-driven flagellar motor ofVibrio alginolyticus is predicted to have four transmembrane segments, whereas the PomB, MotX, and MotY proteins have only a single transmembrane segment (8Asai Y. Kojima S. Kato H. Nishioka N. Kawagishi I. Homma M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5104-5110Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 9McCarter L.L. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4219-4225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10McCarter L.L. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5988-5998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Okunishi I. Kawagishi I. Homma M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2409-2415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). From the predicted topology of PomA, the N- and C-terminal regions and the large loop between transmembrane segments 2 and 3 are located in the cytoplasm. Loop1–2 and loop3–4, between transmembrane segments 1 and 2 and segments 3 and 4, respectively, are thought to be exposed to the periplasmic space (8Asai Y. Kojima S. Kato H. Nishioka N. Kawagishi I. Homma M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5104-5110Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). When the loops were reacted with biotin maleimide, the labeling pattern was different; substitutions in loop3–4 were biotinylated consistently with the membrane topology, whereas none of residues in loop1–2 was labeled (20Asai Y. Shoji T. Kawagishi I. Homma M. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 1001-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that loop1–2 is associated with other proteins, such as the motor proteins PomB, MotX, or MotY, or that it is embedded into the pore region of the channel, as is predicted for the extracellular loops of many ion channels. It has been shown that the negative charge Asp-31 of loop1–2 contributes to optimal speed and/or efficiency of the motor, although the charge is not essential (26Kojima S. Shoji T. Asai Y. Kawagishi I. Homma M. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3314-33418Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). By random mutagenesis of the pomA gene, it was shown that loop3–4 and transmembrane segments 3 and 4 have residues more crucial for function than loop1–2 or transmembrane segments 1 and 2 (27Kojima S. Kuroda M. Kawagishi I. Homma M. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 1759-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In the present study, we focused on periplasmic loop3–4. We found that the P172C mutant protein of PomA is not functional and inhibits the motility of the wild-type cell in the absence of reducing reagents, although motility is restored by DTT. This result suggests that a cross-link formed between two molecules of Cys-PomA via loop3–4 inhibits the function of the torque-generating units. The interaction between cross-linked PomA dimer and PomB is apparently not disrupted, since PomB appears to be co-precipitated about as well with the cross-linked PomA dimer as with the wild-type PomA (data not shown). It is inferred that two molecules of native PomA interact with each other intimately in a torque-generating unit of the motor. Recently, PomA alone was purified as a stable homodimer even if PomB was absent (19Sato K. Homma M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5718-5722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The purified PomA/PomB complex has been reconstituted into proteoliposomes and has been shown to catalyze Na+ influx. Furthermore, a tandem PomA dimer produced as a single polypeptide is functional. Inactivation of either half of the dimer results in complete loss of PomA function. When a phenamil-resistant mutation was introduced into either the first or second half of the tandem PomA dimer, the resistant phenotype was identical to the phenotype of the tandem dimer in which the both halves carried the mutation. Thus, the two halves of the PomA dimer appear to function together (28Sato K. Homma M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20223-20228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The H+-driven flagellar motor contains MotA and MotB, which are homologues to PomA and PomB, respectively. It is thought that the MotA/MotB complex converts H+ influx into the rotation of the flagellar motor (4Blair D.F. Berg H.C. Cell. 1990; 60: 439-449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 6Stolz B. Berg H.C. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7033-7037Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 29Blair D.F. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1995; 49: 489-522Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). From the results of Trp-scanning mutagenesis, a structural model of MotA/MotB complex has been proposed in which a single transmembrane segment of one MotB protein assembles with four transmembrane segments of one MotA protein at a tilt relative to them (5Sharp L.L. Zhou J.D. Blair D.F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9166-9171Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). If this model holds for the H+-driven motor, the existence of a heteromultimeric ion channel complex might be specific for the Na+-driven flagellar motor. On the other hand, estimates of the MotA and MotB protein levels in the membrane ofE. coli suggest that the ratio of MotA to MotB is about 4:1 (30Wilson M.L. Macnab R.M. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 3932-3939Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This finding is consistent with the possibility that MotA and MotB do not make 1:1 complex. The MotA protein of the H+-driven flagellar motor ofRhodobacter sphaeroides can generate torque in response to a sodium-ion flux in a pomA mutant of V. alginolyticus (31Asai Y. Kawagishi I. Sockett R.E. Homma M. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6328-6332Google Scholar). MotA of R. sphaeroides may work in the Na+-driven motor because the torque generators in the H+-and Na+-driven motors have similar structures, i.e. they are heteromultimer complexes. In any case, clarification of the structure of the torque generator is clearly important for an understanding of the mechanism of coupling ion flow to flagellar rotation. Two additional components, MotX and MotY, are required for the rotation of the Na+-driven motor of V. alginolyticus, but homologous proteins are not found in the H+-driven motor (9McCarter L.L. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4219-4225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10McCarter L.L. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5988-5998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Okunishi I. Kawagishi I. Homma M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2409-2415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Furuno M. Nishioka N. Kawagishi I. Homma M. Microbiol. Immunol. 1999; 43: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The functions of MotX and MotY are not clear, although it is thought that they may be involved in ion recognition. MotX and MotY do not co-purify with the PomA/PomB complex (19Sato K. Homma M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5718-5722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). This observation may mean that MotX and MotY are not associated with the PomA/PomB complex, that the association is weak, or that MotX and MotY are unstable during purification. It will be interesting to determine the structural difference between the torque generators of the Na+- and H+-driven flagellar motors. It has been proposed that the rotor is surrounded with multiple torque-generating units, approximately eight units in the H+-driven flagellar motor (32Blair D.F. Berg H.C. Science. 1988; 242: 1678-1681Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) or five to nine in the Na+-driven motor (33Muramoto K. Sugiyama S. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Imae Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3374-3380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We can envision two models to explain the cross-linking of PomA molecules. One is an intra-torque-generator model, in which the cross-links form between two PomA molecules in the same unit. In this argument, loop3–4must face into the unit. The other possibility is an inter-torque-generator model, in which the cross-link occurs between two PomA molecules in different units, so that the loop3–4faces outward. The former model is supported by following criteria; the distance between two generators may be too great for disulfide cross-link to form, PomA forms a stable dimer in the cell, and genetically connected tandem PomA is functional. We need more experiments to elucidate which model is correct. Residue Pro-172 by itself does not seem to be essential for motor function, since motility is normal in PomA mutants in which Pro-172 was replaced by three amino acids other than Cys. Additionally, we observed recovery of swimming ability when the cross-linked dimer was reduced in cells with P172C PomA by DTT. We suggest that the flexibility of loop3–4 is restricted by the cross-linking, thereby impairing motor function. There are at least three possible mechanisms for this inhibition of motor function. (i) Na+ influx is inhibited by disruption of the channel structure. (ii) Conversion of the Na+ influx to conformational changes in the torque-generating stator units is inhibited. (iii) Interactions between the stator and the rotor are inhibited. Understanding of the inhibitory mechanism might lead us to an understanding of the energy transduction mechanism in the flagellar motor. We thank R. M. Macnab for critically reading the manuscript."

An important issue in this nascent field is to evaluate different methods with which to search libraries for molecules that modulate the function of specific target proteins. One strategy is to screen libraries for molecules that bind specifically to a protein known to be critical in the pathway of interest, with the expectation that the molecules isolated will recognize regions of the target protein important for its function and thereby exhibit biological activity. Here, a peptide library was screened using a two-hybrid-like system for molecules able to bind human CDC6 protein (CDC6p), required for the initiation of DNA replication in eukaryotic cells. From a collection of over a million peptides, a single species that exhibited good affinity and specificity for binding CDC6p was obtained. When expressed in human cells, the peptide inhibited cell cycle progression and exhibited other properties expected of a CDC6p inhibitor. This approach, which does not require detailed knowledge of the mechanism of action of a protein target, may be generally useful for isolating peptides capable of manipulating biological pathways.

The availability of such reagents is limited by the number of natural products with specific, well characterized activities. In an effort to circumvent this limitation, many laboratories have turned to combinatorial libraries and high throughput screens to identify compounds with which to manipulate biological pathways. Critical issues in such studies include the type of library employed (peptides, synthetic small molecules, etc.); the diversity of the library; and the sensitivity, specificity, and throughput capacity of the screen used to identify molecules with the desired properties. Functional screens, in which one looks for a phenotypic effect of library-derived compounds, have the advantage that one does not need to define a specific molecular target. This strategy has been applied both to synthetic, encoded combinatorial libraries (1Stockwell B.R. Haggarty S.J. Schreiber S.L. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: 71-83Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 2Mayer T.U. Kapoor T.M. Haggarty S.J. King R.W. Schreiber S.L. Mitchison T.J.

On the other hand, rapid progress in fundamental studies of cellular signaling and regulation has provided many interesting protein targets, the functional modification of which by small molecules would have biological or even clinical importance. In particular, as the critical role of protein-protein interactions in almost any pathway of interest has become apparent, the development of methods to identify compounds able to disrupt or promote these interactions has become the focus of greater interest. However, with some notable exceptions (6Schreiber S.L. Crabtree G.R. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 136-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar), small synthetic molecules have not proven useful for this purpose. The small molecules used in most approaches to this goal are related to enzyme inhibitors, which bind in small, recessed pockets of a protein and are poorly suited to recognize more expansive, relatively flat surfaces typical of protein interaction regions. Newer libraries of macrocyclic, natural product-like species may enhance the probability of success (3Tan D.S. Foley M.A. Stockwell B.R. Shair M.D. Schreiber S.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 9073-9087Crossref Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 7Lee D. Sello J.K. Schreiber S.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 10648-10649Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 8Tan D.S.

Although peptides are not favored by the pharmaceutical industry because of their nonoptimal pharmacological properties, they hold considerable promise as research tools with which to manipulate protein-protein interactions and therefore biological pathways. They can be expressed at high levels in cultured cells in the form of fusion proteins or introduced into cells by conjugation to “delivery peptides” able to cross cell membranes (10Zhang L. Torgerson T.R. Liu X.-Y. Timmons S. Colosia A.D. Hawiger J. Tam J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9184-9189Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 11Singh D. Kiarash K. LaCasse E.C.

They include phage display (14Cwirla S.E. Peters E.A. Barrett R.W. Dower W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6378-6382Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar, 15Needels M.C. Jones D.G.

A potential drawback of using binding assays to screen peptide libraries is that there is no guarantee that the peptides isolated will bind a functionally important surface of the target and affect its activity. Fortunately, sites of macromolecular interactions often appear to be favored locations for binding, possibly because they are open and available within the overall topology of native proteins (20Hyde-DeRuyscher R.

Here, we report the application of a high throughput bacterial screen to the discovery of a peptide inhibitor of cell cycle progression in human cells. Human CDC6 protein (CDC6p)1 (21Williams R.S. Shohet R.V. Stillman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1997; 94: 142-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) is a key component in assembly of the replication complex prior to the initiation of DNA replication (22Dutta A. Bell S.P. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 293-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). CDC6p is recruited by the origin recognition complex (ORC), which in turn promotes loading of the MCM proteins on chromatin (23Tanaka T. Knapp D Nasmyth K. Cell. 1997; 90: 649-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Immunodepletion of CDC6p in living cells arrests the cell cycle in G1, indicating the essential role of CDC6p in human cell proliferation (24Yan Z. DeGregori J. Shohet R. Leone G. Stillman B. Nevins J.R. Williams R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3603-3608Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). These results suggest that compounds able to block the interaction of CDC6p with other replication proteins should be efficient cell cycle inhibitors. We report here the isolation of a CDC6p-binding peptide using a bacterial two-hybrid-like system. This peptide binds specifically to CDC6p with aK D of approximately 10−7m and is capable of reducing CDC6p loading on chromatin in G1 phase and blocking entry of human cells into S phase. These results are of general interest because no particular activity of CDC6p was targeted, nor did the assay specifically seek to disrupt a particular protein-protein interaction. Indeed, the detailed mechanism of action of CDC6p is not yet understood to a point that would permit the rational design of functional screens for a CDC6p-targeted inhibitor. These findings suggest that useful reagents for functional manipulation of important pathways of cell regulation can be obtained from simple binding studies, even in the absence of detailed knowledge of the mechanisms of action of the target protein. In order to detect the peptide encoded by genomic DNA fragment in later experiments, a T7 S10 epitope tag was introduced downstream of the cI repressor DNA binding domain (DBD) in vector pJH391 (25Hu J. O'Shea E.K. Kim P.S. Sauer R.T. Science. 1990; 250: 1400-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) by a pair of oligonucleotides as aHindIII/BamHI fragment. The resulting plasmid was named pJH391S. Chicken genomic DNA (CLONTECH) was completely digested with Sau3AI and cloned en masse intoBamHI-digested and dephosphorylated pJH391S. The ligation products were transformed into Escherichia coli DH12S supercompetent cells (Life Technologies, Inc.), and cells were grown on one hundred 150-mm Luria broth plates supplemented with 50 μg/ml carbenicillin at 37 °C overnight. Analysis of a large number of colonies picked from these plates indicated that there are approximately 5–6 × 106 peptide-expressing plasmids in the library. The full-length CDC6p gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and cloned as aSalI/BamHI fragment into pJH391. A 2.4-kilobaseEcoRI and EcoRV fragment containing the cI DBD and CDC6p was released from the resulting plasmid and cloned intoEcoRI- and PvuII-digested pACYC184 containing a tetracycline resistance gene. The final construct, pCDC6, was transformed into kanamycin-resistant E. coliJH372(Knr) for later experiments. The purified library plasmids were transformed into strain JH372 (25Hu J. O'Shea E.K. Kim P.S. Sauer R.T. Science. 1990; 250: 1400-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) containing pCDC6 via electroporation. After a 30-min recovery, the cells were harvested by low speed centrifugation and resuspended in NZC broth supplemented with carbenicillin (50 μg/ml), kanamycin (10 μg/ml), and tetracycline (20 μg/ml). After the cells were grew at 37 °C for 60 min, phage λ K54H80 and K54, strains deleted for wild type cI (25Hu J. O'Shea E.K. Kim P.S. Sauer R.T. Science. 1990; 250: 1400-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), were added to the culture at a multiplicity of infection of 50. The cells were shaken for another 3 h at 37 °C and then collected by centrifugation, resuspended, and grown as single colonies on Luria broth plates supplemented with the antibiotics carbenicillin, kanamycin and tetracycline. The surviving colonies were picked for further testing. Plasmid DNA was prepared from each colony and retransformed into JH372. Six colonies resistant to Cb/Kn or Cb/Kn/Tet were selected from each transformation and assayed for phage resistance. In brief, bacteria were grown in 150 μl of NZC broth in a microtiter plate well at 37 °C overnight. 20 μl of bacterial culture was mixed with 20 μl of phage solution (5 × 108 phage) and held at room temperature for 30 min. 60 μl of melted top agar (55 °C) was added to the mixture and immediately plated on a Luria broth plate supplemented with Kn and Cb or with Kn, Cb, and Tet. Colonies that contained only the library plasmid but that were resistant to phage infection were considered to express self-associating peptides. In cases in which phage resistance was dependent on both the library-encoding and the target-encoding plasmids, a β-galactosidase assay was performed using the Repressor-regulated, integrated lacZ reporter gene in JH372 to confirm Repressor reconstitution. β-Galactosidase activity was measured as units/min normalized to cell density (A 600). The genomic DNA fragments in candidate clones were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into the NcoI and EcoRI sites of pGEX-Cs. The resulting recombinant plasmids were transformed into E. coliBL21. Production of fusion protein was induced by adding IPTG (0.2 mm) at A 600 0.4 followed by shaking at 37 °C for 3 h. The cells were harvested after centrifugation, resuspended in 1× PBS buffer (138 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2PO4, and 2 mm K2PO4) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and lysed by sonication. Fusion protein was purified over glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Overexpression of CDC6p in HeLa cells was achieved by transient transfection of HeLa cells with pGCN.SCH42FL in which HA-tagged human CDC6p was under the control of the CMV promoter. 24 h posttransfection, cells were washed two times by ice-cold PBS buffer. 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris·Cl, pH 7.5, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 100 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, plus protease inhibitor mixture) was added to each 100 mm plate. The cells were scraped off the plates and left on ice for 30 min to allow for complete lysis. The supernatant was collected after centrifugation at 4 °C for 10 min and used for the in vitro binding assay. Equal volumes of cell lysate containing human CDC6p was added to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads bearing equal amounts of the various GST-peptide fusion proteins. The mixtures were tumbled at 4 °C for 2 h and beads were washed with ice-cold 1× PBS twice, 10 min tumbling at 4 °C for each wash. The proteins retained on the beads were denatured and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Mouse monoclonal antibody against the HA epitope was used for detection of HA-CDC6p protein, mouse monoclonal against GST was used for blotting GST fusion protein. Goat anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate was used as the secondary antibody. The bands were visualized by SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent solution (Pierce). Scrambled mutants of CDC6-BP35 have identical amino acids composition but different sequence. To achieved this, five pairs of oligonucleotides encoding the new peptide were synthesized for each mutant. These oligos were annealed, ligated, and cloned intoNcoI/EcoRI-digested pGEX-CS. The constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The peptide sequences of the scrambled mutants were SDKFYFCVKRSIKYFITHCKIKQGKLKIIKSCKLK for CDC6-BP35S1 and KSLCKSKIKGYFKDFVKYQIKICTKIKSIFKCRHL for CDC6-BP35S2. The experiment was performed essentially as described by Zhang et al. (26Zhang Z. Zhu W. Kodadek T. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Different amounts of the GST-CDC6-BP35 fusion protein were added to the same amount of extract made from HeLa cells transfected with the CDC6p expression plasmid to determine the lowest amount of beads that could be employed. Then, this fixed amount of bead-bound fusion protein (5 ng) was mixed with HeLa cell extract containing different amounts of CDC6 protein (5, 10, 20, 30, 50, and 60 ng); the final volume was 100 μl in 1× lysis buffer. The mixtures were incubated at 4 °C for 2 h and washed with ice-cold PBS twice. The amount of CDC6p retained was determined by SDS-PAGE/Western blot analysis of the bead-bound material. The amount of HA-tagged CDC6p in the HeLa cell lysate was estimated by quantitative Western blot using purified HA-PLP as standard (provided by L. Sun, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). The data were plotted as described by Freifelder (27Freifelder D. Physical Biochemistry. W. H. Freeman, New York1982: 654-658Google Scholar), using the equation 1/r =K D/[CDC6p]free, wherer = [CDC6p]bound/[GST-CDC6-BP35]. The slope of the line obtained in a double r plot provides theK D. HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator and transfected with either pEGFP, pEGFP-CDC6-BP35, or pEGFP-C2 using LipofectAMINE PLUSTM (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were trypsinized from plates 24 h later, washed with ice-cold PBS, and fixed with 0.4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for 10 min. After being washed with ice-cold PBS, cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 at 4 °C for another 10 min. Finally, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS twice and treated with 20 μg/ml propidium iodide and 2 mg/ml RNase for more than 30 min before the FACS assay. CellQuest was used for the FACS data acquisition and analyses. HeLa cells were transfected with pEGFP or pEGFP-CDC6-BP35. 6 h after transfection, cells were cultured in growth medium containing thymidine (2 mm) for 18 h or aphidicolin (5 μg/ml) for 24 h. HeLa cells were released from the block at G1/S boundary by washing twice in growth medium. At different time points after release, cells were harvested and processed for FACS assay as above. HeLa cells were transfected with pEGFP, pEGFP-C2, or pEGFP-CDC6-BP35. 48 h after transfection, cells were stained with Hoechst (10 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 10 min and harvested for sorting. One million green fluorescent cells in G1phase expressing either GFP or GFP fusion protein were sorted. A chromatin-containing fraction was isolated from each group of sorted cells. In brief, cells were suspended in Buffer A (10 mmHepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.34 m sucrose, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor). Triton X-100 was added to the mixture to a final concentration of 0.1%. After 5 min of gentle lysis on ice, nuclei were collected after spinning and washed with Buffer A once. The nuclei were lysed with Buffer B (3 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor), and the chromatin-containing fraction was collected after spinning and washed with Buffer B once. The same amount of each sample (equivalent to 0.3 million cells) was used for SDS-PAGE analysis. Rabbit monoclonal antibodies against ORC2 and MCM3 and mouse monoclonal antibody against CDC6p were used in immunoblots. To isolate a CDC6p-binding peptide from a library, we employed a genetic assay based on reconstitution of the activity of a λ Repressor fragment that includes the entire DBD but lacks the C-terminal dimerization domain (19Hu J.C. Kornacker M.G. Hochschild A. Methods. 2000; 20: 80-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 25Hu J. O'Shea E.K. Kim P.S. Sauer R.T.

Two Repressor DBD fusion proteins are introduced into bacteria, one fused to the target (in this case CDC6p) and the other fused to a peptide library. Binding of the library-encoded peptide to the target protein reconstitutes Repressor dimerization and high affinity binding to operator sequences (Fig. 1), thereby rendering cells that contain the appropriate peptide immune to λ infection (26Zhang Z. Zhu W. Kodadek T. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 30Cairns M.T. Green A.J. White P.M., P.G., J. Brenner S.

Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 575-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). A library of approximately five to six million peptides constructed from chicken genomic DNA fragments (26Zhang Z. Zhu W. Kodadek T. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) was screened against full-length CDC6p fused to the Repressor DBD. 72 colonies survived the phage challenge. The peptide-encoding plasmids from these colonies were isolated and subjected to further analysis. A major source of false positives in this assay is from self-associating peptides that support homo-oligomerization of the Repressor DBD and result in phage immunity even in the absence of the target protein (33Zhang Z. Murphy A. Hu J.C. Kodadek T. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 417-420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Most of the hits were found to be self-associating peptides and were discarded. A few others proved to be false positives of unknown mechanism. In other words, retransformation of fresh cells with the peptide-encoding plasmid in the presence or absence of target-encoding plasmid failed to produce phage resistance. These were also discarded. Seven clones appeared to contain true CDC6p-binding peptides, as judged by high resistance to phage and low expression of an integrated lacZ reporter gene containing a single high affinity operator site in the promoter only when both the peptide- and target-encoding plasmids were present (Fig.2 A).Figure 2Reporter gene-based tests for peptide-CDC6p binding in bacteria. A, analysis of target plasmid dependence of repression. Library plasmids (see Fig. 1 A) from the survivors of the phage challenge assay were isolated and transformed into fresh JH372 cells, which harbor an integrated Repressor-controlled lacZ gene, that either did or did not also harbor the target plasmid. The β-galactosidase activity of the transformants was measured. pCDC6 is the target plasmid; pJH391S is the vector used for peptide library construction; pJH370 encodes a DBD-GCN4 leucine zipper fusion protein and serves as a positive control; pJH379 encodes the DBD alone and serves as a negative control. Peptides that repressed transcription even in the absence of the target plasmid were scored as self-associating peptides and discarded. Peptides that did not repress transcription whether pCDC6 was present or absent were also discarded. B, test of the specificity of the peptide for CDC6p. Each of the seven peptides that passed the “homodimer” test in A was tested against DBD-targets other than CDC6p using the reporter gene assay. Only one, CDC6-BP35, appeared to be selective for CDC6p. Each assay was repeated three times. Error bars represent S.D. All results were normalized to the level of lacZ expression observed when only the Repressor DBD was expressed (pJH379).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In order to test the specificity of this interaction, the plasmids encoding the putative CDC6p-binding peptides were transformed into cells containing a plasmid encoding the Repressor DBD fused to a protein or protein fragment unrelated to CDC6p. These controls included epitopes from the human pro-insulin-like growth factor I (26Zhang Z. Zhu W. Kodadek T. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), pro-IL-1β and full-length FKBP-12 (34Van D.G. Standaert R.F. Karplus P.A. Schreiber S.L. Clardy J. Science. 1991; 252: 839-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). The output of the Repressor-controlled lacZ reporter gene served to monitor the level of interaction of the peptides with these alternative targetsin vivo. Only one of the seven peptides, designated CDC6-BP35, was found to be specific for CDC6p by these criteria (Fig.2 B). Phage resistance assays were also performed (data not shown) and were consistent with the reporter gene results. DNA sequencing of the peptide-encoding region of the BP35-encoding plasmid revealed that the sequence of the single specific hit obtained was FSIVFISFTCQKKKKKKKKKCYLIKCRLYSGDIHI. Because the linker regions of the peptide-encoding and target-encoding plasmids are not identical, the “nonspecific” binding of some of the peptides tested could reflect associations with an epitope between the DBD and the target protein. For example, BP50 and BP36 support repression with all three control targets (Fig. 2 B), consistent with the idea that they recognize some conserved feature of all three of these constructs. However, BP48, BP98, BP38, and BP15 support repression in the presence of some, but not all, targets (Fig. 2 B). Although we do not understand the molecular basis of these results completely, one possibility is that they do recognize an epitope in the linker of the target fusion protein, but depending on the nature of the C-terminal fragment, this epitope may or may not be accessible. In any case, all further efforts were focused on CDC6-BP35. To confirm the interaction of peptide CDC6-BP35 and CDC6p, further experiments were performed in vitro using a GST fusion protein (GST-CDC6-BP35) and a crude extract prepared from HeLa cells 24 h after transfection with an expression vector encoding CDC6p tagged with HA. As shown in Fig. 3, GST-CDC6-BP35 retained approximately 10% of the HA-CDC6p present in the extract, as determined by Western blotting using a highly specific monoclonal antibody raised against the HA epitope. When the same experiment was repeated using control GST fusion proteins containing peptides selected at random out of the library (C2 and C54), no binding of CDC6p was observed (Fig. 3). To test whether CDC6-BP35 binding to CDC6p is specific, three other mammalian proteins, MNFα, PR48, and Dral, were overexpressed in HeLa cells, and lysates containing these proteins were prepared 24 h after transfection. Similar in vitro binding assays showed that the GST-CDC6-BP35 fusion protein retained CDC6p but not MNFα, PR48, or Dral (Fig. 4), demonstrating specificity in the interaction between CDC6-BP35 peptide and CDC6p. As another test of binding specificity, a “scrambled” derivative of CDC6-BP35 was created, CDC6-BP35S1, in which the identical amino acid composition was retained, but the order of residues was altered randomly. This control was deemed particularly important because CDC6-BP35 is a highly basic peptide and relatively nonspecific binding to CDC6p through ionic contacts was a concern. As shown in Fig.5, GST-CDC6-BP35S1 did not bind CDC6p in a manner detectable in this assay, even at concentrations 20-fold higher than that required for binding of CDC6p to GST-CDC6-BP35. An identical result was obtained with the another scrambled peptide CDC6-BP35S2 (data not shown). We conclude that binding of CDC6-BP35 to CDC6p is dependent on the primary sequence of the peptide and not solely on the charged nature of peptide. The CDC6-BP35·CDC6p interaction was examined in somewhat more detail. The complex is stable over a 20-min period in PBS containing up to 350 mm sodium chloride (data not shown). This also argues against an entirely ionic interaction. The equilibrium dissociation constant (K D) of the GST-CDC6-BP35/CDC6p complex under the test conditions was approximately 10−7m, as determined by the titration experiment (27Freifelder D. Physical Biochemistry. W. H. Freeman, New York1982: 654-658Google Scholar) shown in Fig.6. One of major aims of this study was to determine whether a peptide selected simply on the basis of its ability to bind CDC6p could perturb the cell cycle. Because CDC6p is known to be critical for the initiation of DNA replication, a functional effect of the peptide most likely would be observed at the G1/S boundary. To test this possibility, an expression plasmid was constructed that encoded a fusion of the CDC6-BP35 to the C terminus of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EG"
