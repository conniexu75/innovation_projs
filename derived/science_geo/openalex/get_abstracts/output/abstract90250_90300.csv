https://openalex.org/W2045414748,"Porcine pancreatic lipase catalyzes the transesterification reaction between tributyrin and various primary and secondary alcohols in a 99 percent organic medium. Upon further dehydration, the enzyme becomes extremely thermostable. Not only can the dry lipase withstand heating at 100 degrees C for many hours, but it exhibits a high catalytic activity at that temperature. Reduction in water content also alters the substrate specificity of the lipase: in contrast to its wet counterpart, the dry enzyme does not react with bulky tertiary alcohols."
https://openalex.org/W1995611890,"Primary and metastatic carcinomas are epithelial in origin and comprise by far the largest group of malignant tumors in humans. In most of these tumors, T and Tn antigens, whose epitopes have been synthesized, are uncovered and immunoreactive. In all other tissues T and Tn antigens are masked and not accessible to the immune system; they are generally precursors in normal complex carbohydrate chains. Thus, carcinomas have antigens recognized as foreign by the patients' immune system. The expression of T and Tn antigens has pathogenic and clinical consequences, and the antigens themselves are powerful histological markers in carcinoma diagnosis and frequently in prognosis. Most patients distinguish their carcinoma from all other cells, as shown by strong autoimmune responses to T antigen. These responses are readily measured by assays, and they allow detection of carcinomas with greater sensitivity and specificity frequently earlier than previously possible. Moreover, the extent of T and Tn expression often correlates with carcinoma differentiation; on a molecular level, clustered T- and Tn-active structures on carcinoma cell surfaces may be involved in invasion."

Subjects were 10,372 individuals, 18 to 74 years of age, who denied a history of hypertension and intentional modification of their diet. Significant decreases in the consumption of calcium, potassium, vitamin A, and vitamin C were identified as the nutritional factors that distinguished hypertensive from normotensive subjects. Lower calcium intake was the most consistent factor in hypertensive individuals. Across the population, higher intakes of calcium, potassium, and sodium were associated with lower mean systolic blood pressure and lower absolute risk of hypertension. Increments of dietary calcium were also negatively correlated with body mass. Even though these correlations cannot be accepted as proof of causation, they have implications for future studies of the association of nutritional factors and dietary patterns with hypertension in America."

This result supports the hypothesis, based on simulations at low g and experiments at high g, that microgravity depresses whereas high gravity enhances cell proliferation rates. The effects of gravity are particularly strong in cells undergoing differentiation."

https://openalex.org/W2124271343,"A variety of reagents (local anesthetics, phenothiazines, ruthenium red, ryanodine, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, R 24571) inhibit Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release from purified canine cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). Most of these compounds also increase the rate of net Ca2+ uptake by cardiac SR while moderately inhibiting Ca2+-dependent ATP hydrolysis, and together these two effects produce increased coupling ratios for ATP-dependent Ca2+ transport (Ca2+/ATP approximately equal to 2) compared to controls (Ca2+/ATP approximately equal to 1). We conclude that Ca2+ efflux normally occurs during net Ca2+ uptake by isolated cardiac SR vesicles and that this phenomenon is responsible for the low coupling ratios generally observed for cardiac SR preparations. Blockers of sarcolemmal Ca2+ (nitrendipine, diltiazem, methoxyverapamil, dantrolene), at concentrations much greater than those effective for sarcolemmal Ca2+ fluxes, do not affect either Ca2+ uptake or Ca2+ release by cardiac SR. Furthermore, the effects of local anesthetics and phenothiazines on Ca2+ release from cardiac SR are different from those previously reported for skeletal muscle SR. These results indicate that the Ca2+ release channels in cardiac SR are distinct from Ca2+ present in cardiac sarcolemma or in skeletal muscle SR. The common hydrophobic nature but structural dissimilarity of various inhibitors of Ca2+ release from cardiac SR suggest that in some cases a hydrophobic interaction with the membrane might be involved in blocking Ca2+ efflux. On the other hand, half-maximal inhibition by 80 nM ruthenium red is suggestive of a specific ionic interaction with some component of the Ca2+ efflux pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2050563281,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe X-linked disorder leading to early death of affected males. Females with the disease are rare, but seven are known to be affected because of a chromosomal rearrangement involving a site at or near the dmd gene on the X chromosome. One of the seven has a translocation between the X and chromosome 21. The translocation-derived chromosomes from this patient have been isolated, and the translocation is shown to have split the block of genes encoding ribosomal RNA on the short arm of chromosome 21. Thus ribosomal RNA gene probes may be used to identify a junction fragment from the translocation site, allowing access to cloned segments of the X at or near the dmd gene and presenting a new approach to the study of this disease."

(1982) in Gene Amplification and Analysis: Analysis of Nucleic Acids ( Chirkjian , J. G., and Papas , T., eds) pp. 383-415, Elsevier /North-Holland Biomedical Press, Netherlands). Assay methods which allow determination of galactokinase-specific activity (nanomoles of galactose 1-phosphate/min/mg of protein) and plasmid-specific number (femtomoles of plasmid/mg of protein) in the same sonicated cellular extract are described. These methods provide a way to accurately measure and compare the promoter activities (nanomoles of galactose 1-phosphate/min/fmol of plasmid) of different plasmid constructions which exhibit different in vivo plasmid copy numbers. It is demonstrated that in vivo, copy number fluctuations are correlated with such parameters as promoter strength and cellular growth conditions. The ability to account for these uncontrolled in vivo copy number variations when comparing the transcriptional activities of different DNA inserts in multicopy transcription-fusion plasmids greatly facilitates the utility of these systems."
https://openalex.org/W1970913310,"In an insect, the tobacco hornworm Manduca sexta, the cerebral neuropeptide prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH), the primary effector of postembryonic development, exists as two molecular forms. These two PTTH's elicit characteristic in vitro dose responses of activation of prothoracic glands from different developmental stages, an indication that during development the glands change in their sensitivity to the neurohormones. Both PTTH's are active in a specific in situ bioassay. Since they may be released in situ at stage-specific times to evoke distinctly different developmental responses, the PTTH neuroendocrine axis appears to be an effective system for determining the functions of molecular forms of a neurohormone in the regulation of growth and development."

Measurements were made in chicken breast muscle during myogenesis in vivo and in vitro. alpha-Cardiac actin mRNA accounts for more than 90 percent of the sarcomeric actin transcripts expressed in avian embryonic breast muscle.

https://openalex.org/W2158215946,"To determine whether the body fluid shift from the lower limbs toward the head that occurs during spaceflight leads to lasting increases of venous pressure in the upper body, venous pressure and hematocrit measurements were made on four astronauts before flight and 1 and 12 hours after recovery and compared with measurements in space. During the mission the hematocrit was elevated and the venous pressure lowered by 1 to 8 centimeters of water as compared with the preflight data. One hour after landing the hematocrit decreased, indicating a hemodilution, venous pressures were unexpectedly high, and a body weight loss of 4 to 5 percent was observed. Twelve hours later the venous pressures were the lowest recorded during the study. The fluid shift apparently takes place during the first several hours of spaceflight. Thereafter, the pressure in the peripheral veins and the central circulation is lower than that measured before flight."
https://openalex.org/W1578505552,"The thermodynamics and kinetics of the binding to tubulin of the colchicine analog 2-methoxy-5-(2', 3', 4'-trimethoxyphenyl) tropone (termed AC because it lacks the B-ring of colchicine) have been characterized by fluorescence techniques. The fluorescence of AC is weak in aqueous solution and is enhanced 250-fold upon binding to tubulin. The following thermodynamic values were obtained for the interaction at 37 degrees C: K = 3.5 X 10(5) M-1; delta G0 = -7.9 kcal/mol; delta H0 = -6.8 kcal/mol; delta S0 = 3.6 entropy units. The AC-tubulin complex is 1-2 kcal/mol less stable than the colchicine-tubulin complex. The change in fluorescence of AC was employed to measure the kinetics of the association process, and quenching of protein fluorescence was used to measure both association and dissociation. The association process, like that of colchicine, could be resolved into a major fast phase and a minor slow phase. The apparent second order rate constant for the fast phase was found to be 5.2 X 10(4) M-1 S-1 at 37 degrees C, and the activation energy was 13 kcal/mol. This activation energy is 7-11 kcal/mol less than that for the binding of colchicine to tubulin. The difference in activation energies can most easily be rationalized by a mechanism involving a tubulin-induced conformational change in the ligand ( Detrich , H. W., III, Williams, R. C., Jr., Macdonald, T. L., Wilson, L., and Puett , D. (1981) Biochemistry 20, 5999-6005). Such a change would be expected to have a small activation energy in AC because it possesses a freely rotating single bond in place of the B-ring of colchicine."

https://openalex.org/W2061527299,"The shape of the axonal arborization was studied in an identified insect sensory neuron. The distribution of presynaptic varicosities within an axonal arbor was shown to be modulated by the density of neighboring terminals. Removal of neighbors near one portion of the axon terminal increased the growth rate in the denervated region and caused a compensatory retraction in other regions. The results support the hypothesis that the size of an axonal arbor is determined intrinsically, whereas the distribution of varicosities within the terminal is determined extrinsically by neighboring terminals. These findings provide a direct demonstration of the effects of competition on an identified nerve cell, as well as one of the first examples of competitive interactions in an invertebrate central nervous system."

For the next three 24-hour periods, they were in bed from 1200 to 2000 and received triazolam, flurazepam, or placebo at bedtime in parallel groups. Placebo subjects showed significant sleep loss after the shift. Active medication reversed this sleep loss.

This finding enabled us to determine the primary structure of the title compound as Gal(alpha 1-3)Gal(beta 1-4)GlcNAc (beta 1-3)[Gal(alpha 1-3)Gal(beta 1-4)GlcNAc(beta 1-6)]Gal(beta 1-4)GlcNAc (beta 1-3)[Gal(alpha 1-3)Gal(beta 1-4)GlcNAc(beta 1-6)]Gal(beta 1-4)GlcNAc (beta 1-3)Gal(beta 1-4)Glc(beta 1-1)Cer. Alternative branching of this oligosaccharide chain was excluded since the removal of all terminal alpha-Gal and penultimate beta-Gal residues yielded a ceramide nonasaccharide containing one terminal and two internal 1----3-linked GlcNAc residues, as well as two terminal 1----6-linked GlcNAc units. The intermediate degradation products of the ceramide deca- and pentadecasaccharides , viz. the ceramide octa- and dodecasaccharide , obtained by the removal of alpha-Gal residues only, as well as the linear ceramide heptasaccharide, Gal(alpha 1-3)Gal(beta 1-4)GlcNAc(beta 1-3) Gal(beta 1-4)GlcNAc(beta 1-3)Gal(beta 1-4)Glc(beta 1-1)Cer, and ceramide hexasaccharide, Gal(beta 1-4)GlcNAc(beta 1-3)Gal(beta 1-4)GlcNAc (beta 1-3)Gal(beta 1-4)Glc(beta 1-1)Cer, were also investigated.

https://openalex.org/W1503701226,"Isolated canine cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum exhibits Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release from both actively and passively loaded vesicles. The rate and extent of Ca2+ release depend on the extravesicular ionized Ca2+ concentration ( [Ca2+]o) at the onset of release. Maximal release following ATP-dependent, phosphate-facilitated Ca2+ loading (up to 360 nmol of Ca2+/mg of protein/min at 37 degrees C) occurs at 1.5-2 microM [Ca2+]o, with reduced release at both lower and higher Ca2+ concentrations (half-maximal Ca2+ release at approximately 0.8 and 5.5 microM [Ca2+]o). Only a portion of the accumulated Ca2+ is released and the release is followed by reuptake of Ca2+. A similar Ca2+ dependence is obtained in the absence of ATP and Pi by measuring unidirectional Ca2+ efflux from passively loaded vesicles (maximal Ca2+ efflux at 1 microM [Ca2+]o; half-maximal Ca2+-dependent efflux at approximately 0.15 and 13 microM [Ca2+]o). Although the Ca2+ release rates observed in this study are several orders of magnitude lower than the rate of Ca2+ release which occurs in muscle cells in vivo, this Ca2+ release phenomenon may be related to the Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release which has been described for skinned cardiac cells ( Fabiato , A. (1983) Am. J. Physiol. 245, C1-C14). Ca2+ release occurs in the presence of an ATP-regenerating system and is not accompanied by a reduction in ATP hydrolysis. Also, since unidirectional Ca2+ efflux (as high as 860 nmol of Ca2+/mg of protein/min at 37 degrees C) exceeds net Ca2+ release under similar conditions, Ca2+ influx proceeds during the period of net Ca2+ release. Therefore, Ca2+ release does not involve reversal or cessation of inward Ca2+ pumping. Other data indicate that Ca2+ release is not mediated through the Ca2+ pump protein, but occurs through a separate Ca2+-dependent efflux pathway, possibly a channel."
https://openalex.org/W2032934409,"The idea that sustained microgravity will result in altered otolith input requiring a modification of postural control was explored by using the pathway that links the otolith organs and spinal motoneurons. Two related methods were used. First, the Hoffmann reflex was used to measure at specific times the excitability of the soleus-spinal motoneuron pool during a brief unexpected linear acceleration. Second, extensive dynamic postural testing with a moving platform was done before and after flight. The Hoffmann reflex amplitude, reflecting otolith-modulated motoneuron sensitivity, was low in flight after adaptation, and its postflight potentiation may have been dependent on rate of adaptation. The strength of inflight motion sickness symptoms was related to postflight Hoffmann reflex amplitude. Dynamic posture tests showed significant deviations from the results obtained before flight. The strategy used for balance on the moving platform was modified, and the behavior of the subjects suggested a decrease in awareness of the direction and magnitude of the motion."
https://openalex.org/W1503990525,"In order to study the temporal and topological events involved in the processing and assembly of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, a fractionation scheme involving differential centrifugation and discontinuous sucrose density gradient centrifugation was developed for homogenates of chick embryo sternal chondrocytes. The precursors in these subcellular fractions were examined by a series of pulse, pulse-chase, and continuous labeling experiments. When chondrocytes were pulsed for 20 min with [35S]methionine, an immunoprecipitable core protein precursor with an approximate molecular size of 376,000 Da was localized to the rough endoplasmic reticulum fractions. Further incubation under chase conditions showed the presence of the 376,000-Da species as well as two additional polypeptides of higher molecular masses in the smooth membrane-enriched fractions within the next 2 h. This translocation did not occur in the presence of the energy transfer inhibitor carbonyl cyanide-m-chlorophenylhydrazone. The labeling pattern of the newly synthesized core protein precursor with either [3H] mannose or [3H]glucosamine showed that N-linked oligosaccharide addition was found on the earliest synthesized product in the rough endoplasmic reticulum, and the addition of this oligosaccharide was inhibited by co-incubation with tunicamycin. Furthermore, the high mannose oligosaccharide was susceptible to cleavage by endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H, while upon chase approximately 56 and 31% of the glucosamine- and mannose-labeled oligosaccharides, respectively, were processed to resistant forms, presumably in the Golgi complex. Both direct assay of glycosyl- and sulfotransferases requisite for addition of chondroitin sulfate chains and sensitivity of intracellular precursors to chondroitinase, keratanase , and endoglycosidase H suggest that only the N-linked oligosaccharides are added in the rough endoplasmic reticulum and glycosaminoglycan chain addition occurs predominantly in smooth membranes."
https://openalex.org/W2083477296,"A significant postflight reduction in the circulating red cell mass has been observed in both the American and Soviet manned programs. The mechanism and etiology of this loss were studied in blood samples from the four payload crewmen of Spacelab 1 taken before, during, and after flight. These samples and samples from control groups on the ground were analyzed for selected hematological and biochemical parameters, which were chosen on the basis of data previously collected, the restraints imposed by the use of human subjects, and the guidelines established for the first Spacelab mission. Twenty-two hours after weightless exposure, there was an increase in hemoglobin and hematocrit. On day 7 in flight, the hemoglobin and hematocrit remained high and there was a slight decrease in reticulocyte number. On landing, red cell mass, plasma volume, hematocrit, and reticulocyte number were decreased. Throughout the 2-week postflight sampling period, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and reticulocyte number remained below the preflight value. Since this crew was not exposed to 100 percent oxygen these results are viewed as evidence that other spaceflight factors cause the measured red cell mass reduction."
https://openalex.org/W1576975040,"delta 4-3-Ketosteroid 5 beta-reductase was purified about 230-fold from 100,000 X g supernatant of rat liver homogenate using 7 alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one as substrate throughout. The purified enzyme was electrophoretically homogeneous, and its molecular weight determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was 37,000 and that determined by gel filtration chromatography on calibrated Sephadex G-100 column was 37,200. The absorption spectrum of the purified enzyme showed only a peak at 276 nm due to aromatic amino acids, precluding the presence of a prosthetic group such as flavine in the molecule. The enzyme is highly labile in a low buffer concentration, but is markedly stabilized in the presence of 20% glycerol in 10 mM phosphate buffer. Higher buffer concentration such as 300 mM potassium phosphate buffer was also effective to prevent deterioration in the absence of glycerol, but the effect was somewhat lower compared to glycerol. The purified enzyme showed the activity toward a variety of substrates including testosterone, cortisol, cortisone, progesterone, 4-androstene-3,17-dione, 7 alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one, and 7 alpha,12 alpha-dihydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one. The optimal pH for the 5 beta-reduction of 7 alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one was 7.4, and the cofactor required for the reaction was NADPH, while NADH revealed no effect. The enzyme activity was inhibited by p-chloromercuribenzoate, but its inhibition was prevented by the presence of a reduced form of glutathione."

A cerebral vascular event has been found to be temporally consistent with the event-related potential. Averaged evoked vascular responses were measured with bioimpedance techniques from the brain and the arm. Changes in brain blood volume occurred 150 to 250 milliseconds after stimulation synchronized with diastolic but not systolic phases of the cerebral pulse pressure wave. The time course of this phenomenon defies the usually accepted characteristics of metabolic activity. The evoked vascular response may be a neurally mediated event in anticipation of altered metabolic demand, and it offers the possibility of measurement in real time."
https://openalex.org/W1518953398,"The secondary structure content of the COOH-terminal tryptic peptide of colicin E1 has been measured by analysis of UV circular dichroism spectra as a function of pH in aqueous medium and in the presence of the nonionic detergents octyl glucoside and Triton X-100. The alpha-helical content of the peptide increased by approximately 10%, from 45-47% to 56-57%, in the presence of the nonionic detergents, but not in aqueous medium, as the pH was decreased from 4.5 to 3.5. This pH dependence of conformation is similar to that reported elsewhere for the in vitro activity and binding of this peptide. A smaller increase in helical content was observed for the peptide in aqueous medium or in Triton X-100 as the pH was decreased from 6.5 to 4.5. The letter change in helical content was not seen in octyl glucoside which was present at a detergent:peptide stoichiometry 100 times that of Triton. The mean residue ellipticity measured at 222 nm for peptide added to asolectin vesicles by a freeze-thaw treatment was slightly larger at pH 3.5, and substantially larger at pH 4.5, than found at these pH values in the detergent solutions. Changes in helical content at the former, but not the latter pH, could be attributed to peptide insertion. It appears that protonation of one or more acidic amino acid residues in the COOH-terminal region of the molecule causes a conformational change that can be attributed to an extra helical domain that is stabilized in a nonpolar environment. From the similar pH dependence of the conformational change and in vitro binding and activity, it is inferred that interaction of this domain with the membrane is essential for binding and insertion."

Weight discrimination thresholds were raised for 2 or 3 days after flight, suggesting an aftereffect of adaptation to weightlessness."

https://openalex.org/W2015262388,"Genetic screening is a systematic search in the population for persons of certain genotypes. The usual purpose is to detect persons who themselves or whose offspring are at risk for genetic diseases or genetically determined susceptibilities to environmental agents. Is genetic screening a marvel about to free us from the scourge of genetic disease or a menace about to invade our privacy and determine who may reproduce? There are three different types of genetic screening. Newborn screening identifies serious genetic disease at birth, permitting prompt treatment to prevent mental and physical retardation. Fetal screening and prenatal diagnosis identify genetic disease in the fetus permitting selective termination of pregnancy and the opportunity to have children free of defects detectable in utero. Carrier screening identifies individuals heterozygous for a gene for a serious recessive disease who may be at risk for affected offspring. The challenge to society is to provide (by way of cost-effective programs) expert services, including genetic counseling and follow-up, to all who may benefit, to ensure confidentiality and freedom of choice, and to avoid misunderstanding and stigmatization. It is recommended that the objective of screening programs should be to maximize the options available to families at risk rather than to reduce the incidence of genetic diseases. Whenever possible, the providers of these services should be the providers of primary health care. Urgently needed are a greater awareness of avoidable genetic diseases on the part of primary care providers and efforts to familiarize the public with the basic concepts of human genetics through the public school system.In a review of the three principal categories of genetic screening--newborn, fetal, and carrier, Rowley describes the development and current status of each, as well as the ethical, legal, psychological, and social issues involved. He briefly considers the special cases of genetic screening of industrial employees and of semen donors. He recommends that the goal of screening programs should be to maximize the options available to families at risk rather than to reduce the incidence of genetic disease. To accomplish this goal, he urges public and professional education on human genetics, research on the best delivery mechanisms for current technologies, and the clarification and coordination of the roles of health care providers, voluntary organizations, and government agencies."

https://openalex.org/W1646974376,"The activity of monamine oxidase, an enzyme located almost exclusively at the outer mitochondrial membrane, toward the substrate phenylethylamine is used to report the oxygen pressure at the outer mitochondrial membrane of intact cardiac myocytes isolated from hearts of adult rats. The rate of substrate oxidation, under the conditions used, follows the Michaelis-Menten relation, and accordingly can be used as a measure of the local chemical activity of dissolved oxygen. The oxygen pressure at the outer mitochondrial membrane of myocytes, at rest and after 2- to 3-fold stimulation of respiratory oxygen consumption, differs from the extracellular oxygen pressure by at most 2 torr. This implies that most of the large, about 20 torr, difference in oxygen pressure between capillary lumen and mitochondria of the working heart must be extracellular. At physiologically relevant concentrations of the substrates phenylethylamine and norepinephrine, monoamine oxidase activity is relatively insensitive to extracellular oxygen pressure in the range 155 to 8 torr, suggesting a limited role for regulation of biogenic amine oxidation by oxygen availability."
https://openalex.org/W1518042833,"Mornet et al. ( Mornet , D., Bertrand , R., Pantel , P., Audemard , E., Kassab , R. (1981) Nature (Lond.) 292, 301-306) have shown that myosin subfragment 1 (S-1) can be covalently linked to F-actin by the zero-length cross-linker 1-ethyl-3-[3-(dimethylamino)-propyl]carbodiimide. Their results indicated that the stoichiometry of the cross-linked complex is one S-1 to two actin monomers. However, Sutoh ( Sutoh , K. (1983) Biochemistry 22, 1579-1585) reported that S-1 is cross-linked to only one actin monomer. In both of these measurements, the stoichiometry was determined by separating the cross-linked complex from free actin on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels and then determining the concentration of actin and S-1 in the complex. In this study, a new approach was used to determine the stoichiometry of actin to S-1 in the cross-linked complex. The cross-linked actin X S-1 preparation, which was composed of [14C]iodoacetamide-modified S-1 and [3H]N-ethylmaleimide-modified actin, was passed through several cycles of actin depolymerization and centrifugation. This had no effect on the ATPase activity of the cross-linked S-1, but it preferentially removed noncross-linked actin which in turn increased the ratio of S-1 to total actin from 1:5 to 1:2 in the recycled cross-linked preparation. The stoichiometry of the cross-linked complex could then be determined by measuring the amount of free actin in the 42-kDa band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. The amount of free actin in the 42-kDa band was equal to the amount of cross-linked S-1. This establishes that the stoichiometry of the cross-linked complex is one S-1/one F-actin monomer, in agreement with the results of Sutoh ."

https://openalex.org/W1504236153,"The regulation of the gluconeogenic pathway from the 3-carbon precursors pyruvate, lactate, and alanine was investigated in the isolated perfused rat liver. Using pyruvate (less than 1 mM), lactate, or alanine as the gluconeogenic precursor, infusion of the acetoacetate precursors oleate, acetate, or beta-hydroxybutyrate stimulated the rate of glucose production and, in the case of pyruvate (less than 1 mM), the rate of pyruvate decarboxylation. alpha-Cyanocinnamate, an inhibitor of the monocarboxylate transporter, prevented the stimulation of pyruvate decarboxylation and glucose production due to acetate infusion. With lactate as the gluconeogenic precursor, acetate infusion in the presence of L-carnitine stimulated the rate of gluconeogenesis (100%) and ketogenesis (60%) without altering the tissue acetyl-CoA level usually considered a requisite for the stimulation of gluconeogenesis by fatty acids. Hence, our studies suggest that gluconeogenesis from pyruvate or other substrates which are converted to pyruvate prior to glucose synthesis may be limited or controlled by the rate of entry of pyruvate into the mitochondrial compartment on the monocarboxylate translocator."

https://openalex.org/W1553607393,"Actin, the major protein of Naegleria gruberi, is selectively not synthesized during the differentiation of amebae to flagellates. When RNA extracted from cells at intervals during differentiation is translated in the wheat germ cell-free system, a major translation product with the electrophoretic mobility of actin is seen to disappear with time during differentiation. This translation product is shown to be actin by its electrophoretic mobility, copolymerization with rabbit actin, peptide map, and immunoprecipitation by antibodies specific to Naegleria actin. Multiple isoforms of actin are synthesized in the cell-free system. Quantitative immunoprecipitation of translation products was employed to measure the relative amount of actin mRNA. Translatable actin mRNA begins to decrease in abundance within 7 min after the initiation of differentiation and thereafter decreases with a half-life of about 25 min. The selective disappearance of this major translatable mRNA provides a favorable opportunity to dissect the rules governing the half-life of a specific mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1542802388,"Acid dissociation equilibrium constants and rate constants for disulfide interchange reactions have been measured in 50% methanol at low ionic strength for peptides containing cysteines with local ionic neighboring groups. These physical constants may be correlated by separation of free energy contributions into solvent-independent and solvent-dependent factors. The former represent inductive effects which may be evaluated by extrapolation of pKa values to the limit of infinite ionic strength. These solvent-independent contributions give Br onsted coefficients consistent with previously reported values for disulfides with neutral constituents. The solvent-dependent contributions represent thru-solvent electrostatic effects and are consistent with the form of the Bjerrum relationship correlating molecular charges, intergroup distances, and the dielectric constant of the solvent. These results provide a quantitative framework for developing strategies for employing coulombic interactions to direct disulfide pairing in synthetic polypeptides."

These rapid-eye-movement functions in flight may be the first variations of an oscillatory system. The ratio of the higher and lower eye movement frequencies oscillates within normal-gravity limits.
https://openalex.org/W1584972264,"1L-Inositol 1-phosphate synthase (EC 5.5.1.4) devoid of bound NAD+ was isolated from mature pollen of Lilium longiflorum ( Easter lily ). The enzyme has a molecular weight of 157,000 +/- 15,000 and a subunit weight of 61,000 +/- 5,000. Kinetic studies of the uninhibited reaction and of inhibition by 2-deoxy-D-glucose 6-phosphate and NADH show the reaction to be ordered sequential with NAD+ adding first. The Michaelis constants for NAD+ and D-glucose 6-phosphate are 2.4 and 65 microM, respectively. The Ki for 2-deoxy-D-glucose 6-phosphate was 8.7 and 2.0 microM, respectively, when D-glucose 6-phosphate or NAD+ was varied. The Ki for NADH and variable NAD+ was 4.7 microM and, for NADH and variable D-glucose 6-phosphate, 3.9 microM."

https://openalex.org/W1517345684,"7F0 ---- 5D0 excitation spectroscopy of Eu(III) has shown that human Factor Xa has two high affinity lanthanide ion-binding sites. The deuterium isotope effect on the reciprocal lifetime (tau-1) of excited Eu(III) in human Factor Xa has indicated that 2 to 3 water molecules remain on Eu(III) after being complexed by Factor Xa, suggesting that 3-6 ligand atoms are provided by the protein, probably through two or three gamma-carboxyglutamic acids (GLA). F orster -type interlanthanide energy transfer has been utilized to measure the distance between the high affinity metal ion-binding sites of human Factor Xa using Tb(III) as an energy donor and Nd(III), Ho(III), or Er(III) as energy acceptors. Tau-1 values of Tb(III) in the presence of the acceptor ions Nd(III), Ho(III), and Er(III) were 1.90, 1.66, and 1.76 ms-1, respectively, which compared to 1.31 ms-1 in the presence of the nonacceptor ion Gd(III), yield energy transfer efficiencies of 0.29, 0.20, and 0.24, respectively. From these efficiencies and published critical distances (R0) ( Horrocks , W. DeW ., Jr., Rhee , M-J., Snyder, A. P., and Sudnick , D. R. (1980) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 102, 3650-3652), the distance between two high affinity sites is estimated to be 10.7 A. Based on these data, we propose that the two high affinity sites of human Factor Xa consist of two paired GLA residues; GLA-19, GLA-20 and GLA-25, GLA-26 together with one of the remaining single GLA residues for each site."
