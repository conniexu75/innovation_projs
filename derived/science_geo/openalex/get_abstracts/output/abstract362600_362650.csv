https://openalex.org/W2148521032,"For the past 25 years, it has been known that alterations in DNA methylation (DNAm) occur in cancer, including hypomethylation of oncogenes and hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes. However, most studies of cancer methylation have assumed that functionally important DNAm will occur in promoters, and that most DNAm changes in cancer occur in CpG islands. Here we show that most methylation alterations in colon cancer occur not in promoters, and also not in CpG islands, but in sequences up to 2 kb distant, which we term 'CpG island shores'. CpG island shore methylation was strongly related to gene expression, and it was highly conserved in mouse, discriminating tissue types regardless of species of origin. There was a notable overlap (45-65%) of the locations of colon cancer-related methylation changes with those that distinguished normal tissues, with hypermethylation enriched closer to the associated CpG islands, and hypomethylation enriched further from the associated CpG island and resembling that of noncolon normal tissues. Thus, methylation changes in cancer are at sites that vary normally in tissue differentiation, consistent with the epigenetic progenitor model of cancer, which proposes that epigenetic alterations affecting tissue-specific differentiation are the predominant mechanism by which epigenetic changes cause cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2058599028,"Cerebral cavernous malformation (CCM) is a common vascular dysplasia that affects both systemic and central nervous system blood vessels. Loss of function mutations in the CCM2 gene cause CCM. Here we show that targeted disruption of Ccm2 in mice results in failed lumen formation and early embryonic death through an endothelial cell autonomous mechanism. We show that CCM2 regulates endothelial cytoskeletal architecture, cell-to-cell interactions and lumen formation. Heterozygosity at Ccm2, a genotype equivalent to that in human CCM, results in impaired endothelial barrier function. On the basis of our biochemical studies indicating that loss of CCM2 results in activation of RHOA GTPase, we rescued the cellular phenotype and barrier function in heterozygous mice with simvastatin, a drug known to inhibit Rho GTPases. These data offer the prospect for pharmacological treatment of a human vascular dysplasia with a widely available and safe drug."

Diversity-oriented synthesis and small-molecule microarrays enabled the discovery of robotnikinin, a small molecule that binds the extracellular Sonic hedgehog (Shh) protein and blocks Shh signaling in cell lines, human primary keratinocytes and a synthetic model of human skin. Shh pathway activity is rescued by small-molecule agonists of Smoothened, which functions immediately downstream of the Shh receptor Patched."
https://openalex.org/W2098450085,"Heart failure is a leading cause of mortality in South Asians. However, its genetic etiology remains largely unknown. Cardiomyopathies due to sarcomeric mutations are a major monogenic cause for heart failure (MIM600958). Here, we describe a deletion of 25 bp in the gene encoding cardiac myosin binding protein C (MYBPC3) that is associated with heritable cardiomyopathies and an increased risk of heart failure in Indian populations (initial study OR = 5.3 (95% CI = 2.3-13), P = 2 x 10(-6); replication study OR = 8.59 (3.19-25.05), P = 3 x 10(-8); combined OR = 6.99 (3.68-13.57), P = 4 x 10(-11)) and that disrupts cardiomyocyte structure in vitro. Its prevalence was found to be high (approximately 4%) in populations of Indian subcontinental ancestry. The finding of a common risk factor implicated in South Asian subjects with cardiomyopathy will help in identifying and counseling individuals predisposed to cardiac diseases in this region."
https://openalex.org/W2079902751,"Background Little is known about the immunopathogenesis of Chikungunya virus. Circulating levels of immune mediators and growth factors were analyzed from patients infected during the first Singaporean Chikungunya fever outbreak in early 2008 to establish biomarkers associated with infection and/or disease severity. Methods and Findings Adult patients with laboratory-confirmed Chikungunya fever infection, who were referred to the Communicable Disease Centre/Tan Tock Seng Hospital during the period from January to February 2008, were included in this retrospective study. Plasma fractions were analyzed using a multiplex-microbead immunoassay. Among the patients, the most common clinical features were fever (100%), arthralgia (90%), rash (50%) and conjunctivitis (40%). Profiles of 30 cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors were able to discriminate the clinical forms of Chikungunya from healthy controls, with patients classified as non-severe and severe disease. Levels of 8 plasma cytokines and 4 growth factors were significantly elevated. Statistical analysis showed that an increase in IL-1Î², IL-6 and a decrease in RANTES were associated with disease severity. Conclusions This is the first comprehensive report on the production of cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors during acute Chikungunya virus infection. Using these biomarkers, we were able to distinguish between mild disease and more severe forms of Chikungunya fever, thus enabling the identification of patients with poor prognosis and monitoring of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W2008776460,"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) synthesis is known to play a major part in numerous inflammatory disorders, and multiple transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms have therefore evolved to dampen the production of this key proinflammatory cytokine. The high expression of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt), an enzyme involved in the nicotinamide-dependent NAD biosynthetic pathway, in cells of the immune system has led us to examine the potential relationship between NAD metabolism and inflammation. We show here that intracellular NAD concentration promotes TNF synthesis by activated immune cells. Using a positive screen, we have identified Sirt6, a member of the sirtuin family, as the NAD-dependent enzyme able to regulate TNF production by acting at a post-transcriptional step. These studies reveal a previously undescribed relationship between metabolism and the inflammatory response and identify Sirt6 and the nicotinamide-dependent NAD biosynthetic pathway as novel candidates for immunointervention in an inflammatory setting."
https://openalex.org/W2094722906,"Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs) are human vascular malformations caused by mutations in three genes of unknown function: KRIT1, CCM2 and PDCD10. Here we show that the heart of glass (HEG1) receptor, which in zebrafish has been linked to ccm gene function, is selectively expressed in endothelial cells. Heg1(-/-) mice showed defective integrity of the heart, blood vessels and lymphatic vessels. Heg1(-/-); Ccm2(lacZ/+) and Ccm2(lacZ/lacZ) mice had more severe cardiovascular defects and died early in development owing to a failure of nascent endothelial cells to associate into patent vessels. This endothelial cell phenotype was shared by zebrafish embryos deficient in heg, krit1 or ccm2 and reproduced in CCM2-deficient human endothelial cells in vitro. Defects in the hearts of zebrafish lacking heg or ccm2, in the aortas of early mouse embryos lacking CCM2 and in the lymphatic vessels of neonatal mice lacking HEG1 were associated with abnormal endothelial cell junctions like those observed in human CCMs. Biochemical and cellular imaging analyses identified a cell-autonomous pathway in which the HEG1 receptor couples to KRIT1 at these cell junctions. This study identifies HEG1-CCM protein signaling as a crucial regulator of heart and vessel formation and integrity."

https://openalex.org/W1975794113,"Histone methylation is associated with both transcription activation and repression. However, the functions of different states of methylation remain largely elusive. Here, using methyl-lysine analog technology, we demonstrate that the histone deacetylase complex, Rpd3S, can distinguish the nucleosomes methylated to different extents and that K36me2 is sufficient to target Rpd3S in vitro. Through a genome-wide survey, we identified a few mutants in which the level of K36me3 is significantly reduced, whereas the level of K36me2 is sustained. Transcription analysis and genome-wide histone modification studies on these mutants suggested that K36me2 is sufficient to target Rpd3S in vivo, thereby maintaining a functional Set2-Rpd3S pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2060209229,"The density of circulating hepatitis C virus (HCV) particles in the blood of chronically infected patients is very heterogeneous. The very low density of some particles has been attributed to an association of the virus with apolipoprotein B (apoB) positive and triglyceride rich lipoproteins (TRL) likely resulting in hybrid lipoproteins known as lipo-viro-particles (LVP) containing the viral envelope glycoproteins E1 and E2, capsid and viral RNA. The specific infectivity of these particles has been shown to be higher than the infectivity of particles of higher density. The nature of the association of HCV particles with lipoproteins remains elusive and the role of apolipoproteins in the synthesis and assembly of the viral particles is unknown. The human intestinal Caco-2 cell line differentiates in vitro into polarized and apoB secreting cells during asymmetric culture on porous filters. By using this cell culture system, cells stably expressing E1 and E2 secreted the glycoproteins into the basal culture medium after one week of differentiation concomitantly with TRL secretion. Secreted glycoproteins were only detected in apoB containing density fractions. The E1âE2 and apoB containing particles were unique complexes bearing the envelope glycoproteins at their surface since apoB could be co-immunoprecipitated with E2-specific antibodies. Envelope protein secretion was reduced by inhibiting the lipidation of apoB with an inhibitor of the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein. HCV glycoproteins were similarly secreted in association with TRL from the human liver cell line HepG2 but not by Huh-7 and Huh-7.5 hepatoma cells that proved deficient for lipoprotein assembly. These data indicate that HCV envelope glycoproteins have the intrinsic capacity to utilize apoB synthesis and lipoprotein assembly machinery even in the absence of the other HCV proteins. A model for LVP assembly is proposed."

They find that Pten/mTOR signaling only regulates growth of layer 2/3 apical dendrites. Can dendrites grow in mature cortex? We used chronic in vivo imaging to follow pyramidal neurons before and after cortical deletion of the Pten tumor suppressor gene in mature mice. We found that Pten/mTOR signaling uniquely regulates the growth of layer 2/3 apical dendrites; no effects of gene deletion were observed on basal dendrites of these pyramidal neurons or along layer 5 apical dendrites.

The resulting transgenic plant cell culture produced a variety of unnatural alkaloid compounds when cocultured with simple, achiral, commercially available precursors that the reengineered enzyme was designed to accept. This work demonstrates the power of genetic engineering to retailor the structures of complex alkaloid natural products in plant culture."
https://openalex.org/W2079134228,"The greater wax moth Galleria mellonella has been widely used as a heterologous host for a number of fungal pathogens including Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans. A positive correlation in pathogenicity of these yeasts in this insect model and animal models has been observed. However, very few studies have evaluated the possibility of applying this heterologous insect model to investigate virulence traits of the filamentous fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus, the leading cause of invasive aspergillosis. Here, we have examined the impact of mutations in genes involved in melanin biosynthesis on the pathogenicity of A. fumigatus in the G. mellonella model. Melanization in A. fumigatus confers bluish-grey color to conidia and is a known virulence factor in mammal models. Surprisingly, conidial color mutants in B5233 background that have deletions in the defined six-gene cluster required for DHN-melanin biosynthesis caused enhanced insect mortality compared to the parent strain. To further examine and confirm the relationship between melanization defects and enhanced virulence in the wax moth model, we performed random insertional mutagenesis in the Af293 genetic background to isolate mutants producing altered conidia colors. Strains producing conidia of previously identified colors and of novel colors were isolated. Interestingly, these color mutants displayed a higher level of pathogenicity in the insect model compared to the wild type. Although some of the more virulent color mutants showed increased resistance to hydrogen peroxide, overall phenotypic characterizations including secondary metabolite production, metalloproteinase activity, and germination rate did not reveal a general mechanism accountable for the enhanced virulence of these color mutants observed in the insect model. Our observations indicate instead, that exacerbated immune response of the wax moth induced by increased exposure of PAMPs (pathogen-associated molecular patterns) may cause self-damage that results in increased mortality of larvae infected with the color mutants. The current study underscores the limitations of using this insect model for inferring the pathogenic potential of A. fumigatus strains in mammals, but also points to the importance of understanding the innate immunity of the insect host in providing insights into the pathogenicity level of different fungal strains in this model. Additionally, our observations that melanization defective color mutants demonstrate increased virulence in the insect wax moth, suggest the potential of using melanization defective mutants of native insect fungal pathogens in the biological control of insect populations."
https://openalex.org/W2023863308,"The Asiatic honeybee, Apis cerana Fabricius, is an important honeybee species in Asian countries. It is still found in the wild, but is also one of the few bee species that can be domesticated. It has acquired some genetic advantages and significantly different biological characteristics compared with other Apis species. However, it has been less studied, and over the past two decades, has become a threatened species in China. We designed primers for the sequences of the four antimicrobial peptide cDNA gene families (abaecin, defensin, apidaecin, and hymenoptaecin) of the Western honeybee, Apis mellifera L. and identified all the antimicrobial peptide cDNA genes in the Asiatic honeybee for the first time. All the sequences were amplified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In all, 29 different defensin cDNA genes coding 7 different defensin peptides, 11 different abaecin cDNA genes coding 2 different abaecin peptides, 13 different apidaecin cDNA genes coding 4 apidaecin peptides and 34 different hymenoptaecin cDNA genes coding 13 different hymenoptaecin peptides were cloned and identified from the Asiatic honeybee adult workers. Detailed comparison of these four antimicrobial peptide gene families with those of the Western honeybee revealed that there are many similarities in the quantity and amino acid components of peptides in the abaecin, defensin and apidaecin families, while many more hymenoptaecin peptides are found in the Asiatic honeybee than those in the Western honeybee (13 versus 1). The results indicated that the Asiatic honeybee adult generated more variable antimicrobial peptides, especially hymenoptaecin peptides than the Western honeybee when stimulated by pathogens or injury. This suggests that, compared to the Western honeybee that has a longer history of domestication, selection on the Asiatic honeybee has favored the generation of more variable antimicrobial peptides as protection against pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2051846162,"E-cadherin (cadh), a member of a family of integral membrane glycoproteins that represent the major component of adherens junctions (AJs), mediates cellâcell adhesion through the calcium-dependent homophilic interaction of its extracellular domain. Metastatic human carcinomas frequently lose E-cadh expression, whereas epithelial ovarian cancer (EOCs) maintain properties characteristic of MÃ¼llerian epithelium during tumor progression, including E-cadh expression. Here, we examined the potential role of cellâcell contacts in EOCs through E-cadh homophilic interactions in PI3K/AKT activation whose altered signaling has been implicated in EOC pathogenesis. We show that E-cadh is predominantly expressed at cellâcell contacts and its functionality is necessary and sufficient for the activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway. E-cadh knockdown and phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) inhibition complement each other in impairing cell-cycle progression and proliferation of ovarian carcinoma cells. E-cadh is stably bound to the PI3K complex, and the de novo formation of E-cadh/Î²-catenin complexes following calcium deprivation and subsequent calcium restoration recruits the PI3K p85 subunit to the site of the cellâcell contacts. The finding that E-cadh-mediated AJ formation contributes to PI3K/AKT activation in EOC cells by a mechanism that appears to be restricted to these cells provides the underpinning for therapeutic strategies that exploit PI3K inhibition to halt EOCs."

https://openalex.org/W2015061830,"The nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinase c-Abl regulates cell proliferation and survival. Recent studies provide evidence that implicate c-Abl as a mediator for fibrotic responses induced by transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), but the precise mechanisms underlying this novel oncogene function are unknown. Here, we report that when expressed in normal fibroblasts, a constitutively active mutant of Abl that causes chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) stimulated the expression and transcriptional activity of the early growth response factor 1 (Egr-1). Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), lacking c-Abl, were resistant to TGF-beta stimulation. Responsiveness of these MEFs to TGF-beta could be rescued by wild-type c-Abl, but not by a kinase-deficient mutant form of c-Abl. Furthermore, Abl kinase activity was necessary for the induction of Egr-1 by TGF-beta in normal fibroblasts, and Egr-1 was required for stimulation of collagen by Bcr-Abl. Lesional skin fibroblasts in mice with bleomycin-induced fibrosis of skin displayed evidence of c-Abl activation in situ, and elevated phospho-c-Abl correlated with increased local expression of Egr-1. Collectively, these results position Egr-1 downstream of c-Abl in the fibrotic response, delineate a novel Egr-1-dependent intracellular signaling mechanism that underlies the involvement of c-Abl in certain TGF-beta responses, and identify Egr-1 as a target of inhibition by imatinib. Furthermore, the findings show in situ activation of c-Abl paralleling the upregulated tissue expression of Egr-1 that accompanies fibrosis. Pharmacological targeting of c-Abl and its downstream effector pathways may, therefore, represent a novel therapeutic approach to blocking TGF-beta-dependent fibrotic processes."
https://openalex.org/W2095878168,"Macrophages act to protect the body against inflammation and infection by engaging in chemotaxis and phagocytosis. In chemotaxis, macrophages use an actin-based membrane structure, the podosome, to migrate to inflamed tissues. In phagocytosis, macrophages form another type of actin-based membrane structure, the phagocytic cup, to ingest foreign materials such as bacteria. The formation of these membrane structures is severely affected in macrophages from patients with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS), an X chromosome-linked immunodeficiency disorder. WAS patients lack WAS protein (WASP), suggesting that WASP is required for the formation of podosomes and phagocytic cups. Here we have demonstrated that formin-binding protein 17 (FBP17) recruits WASP, WASP-interacting protein (WIP), and dynamin-2 to the plasma membrane and that this recruitment is necessary for the formation of podosomes and phagocytic cups. The N-terminal EFC (extended FER-CIP4 homology)/F-BAR (FER-CIP4 homology and Bin-amphiphysin-Rvs) domain of FBP17 was previously shown to have membrane binding and deformation activities. Our results suggest that FBP17 facilitates membrane deformation and actin polymerization to occur simultaneously at the same membrane sites, which mediates a common molecular step in the formation of podosomes and phagocytic cups. These results provide a potential mechanism underlying the recurrent infections in WAS patients."
https://openalex.org/W2084317612,"p53 tumor suppressor activity is negatively regulated through binding to the oncogenic proteins Hdm2 and HdmX. The p53 residues Leu(26), Trp(23), and Phe(19) are crucial to mediate these interactions. Inhibiting p53 binding to both Hdm2 and HdmX should be a promising clinical approach to reactivate p53 in the cancer setting, but previous studies have suggested that the discovery of dual Hdm2/HdmX inhibitors will be difficult. We have determined the crystal structures at 1.3 A of the N-terminal domain of HdmX bound to two p53 peptidomimetics without and with a 6-chlorine substituent on the indole (which binds in the same subpocket as Trp(23) of p53). The latter compound is the most potent peptide-based antagonist of the p53-Hdm2 interaction yet to be described. The x-ray structures revealed surprising conformational changes of the binding cleft of HdmX, including an ""open conformation"" of Tyr(99) and unexpected ""cross-talk"" between the Trp and Leu pockets. Notably, the 6-chloro p53 peptidomimetic bound with high affinity to both HdmX and Hdm2 (K(d) values of 36 and 7 nm, respectively). Our results suggest that the development of potent dual inhibitors for HdmX and Hdm2 should be feasible. They also reveal possible conformational states of HdmX, which should lead to a better prediction of its interactions with potential biological partners."
https://openalex.org/W2017167286,"Î²Arrestin is a multifunctional signal scaffold protein. Using SPOT immobilized peptide arrays, coupled with scanning alanine substitution and mutagenesis, we show that the MAPK kinase, MEK1, interacts directly with Î²arrestin1. Asp26 and Asp29 in the N-terminal domain of Î²arrestin1 are critical for its binding to MEK1, whereas Arg47 and Arg49 in the N-terminal domain of MEK1 are critical for its binding to Î²arrestin1.

The Î²2-adrenergic receptor (Î²2-AR) has provided a critical functional paradigm in elucidating this fundamental process, where agonist occupancy triggers its phosphorylation by G-protein-coupled receptor kinase, thereby initiating the recruitment of cytosolic Î²arrestins (3.Ferguson S.S.

By associating with agonist-occupied receptors, Î²arrestins attenuate GPCR functioning by both regulating interaction with signal-transducing G-proteins and facilitating GPCR internalization, leading to either recycling or degradation of the targeted receptor (5.Baillie G.S.

The agonist-stimulated recruitment of Î²arrestin to GPCRs, such as the Î²2-AR, leads to the dephosphorylation of Î²arrestin1 at this site. This event acts as a molecular switch, allowing for the internalization of the Î²2-AR-sequestered Î²arrestin complex. Thus, ERK-phosphorylated Î²arrestin1 is unable to associate with clathrin cages, whereas this constraint is removed upon its dephosphorylation (9.Lin F.T. Miller W.E. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J.

Compartmentalization and fidelity of this action is endowed by the ability of these proteins to interact and dock to each other, where a motif called the CD domain has been shown to play an underpinning role (13.Tanoue T. Nishida E. Pharmacol. Ther. 2002; 93: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In particular, MEK1 is known to bind to a negatively charged cluster that consists of two aspartate residues separated by any other two amino acids (DXXD) (14.Tanoue T. Adachi M. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). The functioning of MEK1 has been shown to be integral to many cellular processes, such as transcription regulation, proliferation, and differentiation. Therapeutically, inhibitors of MEK1 have been developed as potential therapeutics for cancer and, more recently, have become the focus of development for treating chronic inflammatory disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis and asthma (15.Pelaia G.

In other studies, it has been suggested that constitutive Î²arrestin-ERK1 complexes probably recruit MEK1 through its binding to ERK as a consequence of active Ras-dependent signaling (19.DeFea K.A.

However, a recent report suggests that MEK can bind directly to Î²arrestin1 (24.Song, X., Coffa, S., Fu, H., and Gurevich, V. V. (2008) J. Biol. Chem.Google Scholar) within sites on both N and C domains. Critically, however, the exact nature of MEK interaction with Î²arrestin1 is unclear. Given that Î²arrestin1 is ERK-phosphorylated in the cytosol (9.Lin F.T. Miller W.E. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15971-15974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and the critical importance of this event to Î²arrestin-mediated GPCR internalization, the nature of MEK1 interaction with Î²arrestin warrants investigation. Here then, we evaluate MEK1 interaction with the signal scaffolding protein, Î²arrestin1, demonstrating that MEK1 binds directly to Î²arrestin1, allowing the identification of a functionally active peptide disruptor of this complex.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsâBradford reagent was from Bio-Rad. The following antibodies were used at concentrations of 1:2000: MEK1 (2352), MEK1/2 (4694), ERK2 (9108), ERK1/2 (4694), and Î²arrestin1 phospho-Ser412 (2416) (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA); Î²2-AR (sc-569), glutathione S-transferase (GST) (sc-53909), clathrin HC (sc-12734), and hemagglutinin probe (sc-7372) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA); Î²arrestin1 phospho-Ser412 (44-200; lot 0102), anti-Src pan (44-655G), and anti-His-horseradish peroxidase (P/N 56-0707) (Invitrogen); and FLAG-horseradish peroxidase (A8592) (Sigma). Monoclonal antisera specific for the PDE4D subfamily was a kind gift from Dr. S Wolda (ICOS Corp., Seattle, WA). Active GST-MEK1 (SGT-220) and inactive HisMEK1 (14-706) were purchased from Millipore. HEKB2 cells were a kind gift from Prof. Graeme Milligan (University of Glasgow). Cell-permeable peptides were a gift from Prof. Enno Klusmann (Leibniz-Institut fuÌr Molekulare Pharmakologie, Berlin).Cell Culture and Drug AdditionsâHEK293 cells and HEK293 cell lines stably overexpressing FLAG-tagged Î²2-AR-GFP (HEKB2 cells) were cultured as described previously (25.Bolger G.B. McCahill A. Huston E. Cheung Y.F. McSorley T. Baillie G.S. Houslay M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49230-49238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Transfection of these cells was done using Polyfect (Qiagen), following the manufacturer's instructions. Pretreatments for control experiments were done 10 min (UO126, 10 Î¼m) or 2 h (cell-permeable peptides, 10 Î¼m) prior to the addition of isoproterenol (10 Î¼m).Preparation of Peptide Small Molecule DisruptorsâBriefly, all stearyl-peptides were prepared by treatment of the peptide resins with stearic acid and diisopropylcarbodiimide in the presence of N-hydroxybenzotriazole, followed by deprotection using trifluoroacetic acid/ethanedithiol (26.Futaki S. Ohashi W. Suzuki T. Niwa M. Tanaka S. Ueda K. Harashima H. Sugiura Y. Bioconjugate Chem. 2001; 12: 1005-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar).Fluorescent peptides were prepared by adding 2 mg of 5,6-carboxyfluorescein N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (in 0.9 ml of DMSO, 100 Î¼l of 0.1 m NaHCO3, pH 8.5) to 10 mg of peptide to be labeled. After reaction at room temperature in darkness for 20 h, the reaction mix was directly applied to preparative high pressure liquid chromatography. Fractions containing labeled peptide were collected and lyophilized.Peptide Arrays and Alanine ScansâÎ²arrestin1 and MEK1 peptide libraries were produced by automatic SPOT synthesis as described previously (27.Baillie G.S. Adams D.R. Bhari N. Houslay T.M. Vadrevu S. Meng D. Li X. Dunlop A. Milligan G. Bolger G.B. Klussmann E. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 2007; 404: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). They were synthesized on continuous cellulose membrane supports on Whatman 50 cellulose membranes using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry with the AutoSpot-Robot ASS 222 (Intavis Bioanalytical Instruments AG, KoÌln, Germany). Alanine-scanning peptide libraries were constructed by taking the residues in positive spots and sequentially changing each residue to alanine (or, if an alanine was the natural amino acid at that position, to aspartate). The interaction of spotted peptides with purified, recombinant GST and GST-Î²arrestin1 and GST-MEK1 fusion proteins was determined by overlaying the cellulose membranes with 10 Î¼g/ml recombinant protein. Bound recombinant proteins were then detected following wash steps with rabbit anti-GST, and detection was performed with a secondary anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-coupled antibody.Expression of GST Fusions in Escherichia coliâCultures of E. coli JM109 containing pGEX-Î²-arrestin1 or pGEX were induced with 1 mm isopropyl-Î²-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Roche Applied Science) for 4 h at 30 Â°C. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation at 6,000 Ã g for 15 min at 4 Â°C, and the bacterial pellet was frozen at -80 Â°C overnight. The bacterial pellets were resuspended in 10 ml of ice-cold resuspension buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Î²-mercaptoethanol, and complete protease inhibitor mixture) and sonicated with four 30-s bursts at the maximal setting. Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 0.02%, and cell debris was then removed by centrifugation at 15,000 Ã g for 10 min at 4 Â°C. The cleared supernatant was incubated with one-tenth volume of pre-equilibrated glutathione-Sepharose beads on an orbital shaker for 30 min at 4 Â°C. The beads were collected by centrifugation at 13,000 Ã g for 1 min and washed three times with ice-cold resuspension buffer. The fusion proteins were eluted by the addition of 5 mm glutathione, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and dialyzed three times against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 5% glycerol. The purified fusion proteins were stored at -80 Â°C until required.Plasmid Construction and Site-directed MutagenesisâFLAG-tagged Î²arrestin1, which was generated by an insertion of the full open reading frame of Î²arrestin1 into the Not1 site of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), was a kind gift from Dr. Graeme B. Bolger (University of Alabama at Birmingham). Primers 5-GGGAAAGCGGGCCTTTGTGGCCCACATCGACCTCGTGGACC-3 and 5-GGTCCACGAGGTCGATGTGGGCCACAAAGGCCCGCTTTCCC-3 were used to generated the FLAG-tagged D26A/D29A-Î²arrestin1 mutant with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The pCHA-MEK1 construct was a gift from Prof. Walter Kolch (Beatson Institute for Cancer Research, Glasgow, UK). Details of the construct were described previously (28.Catling A.D. Schaeffer H.J. Reuter C.W. Reddy G.R. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5214-5225Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Primers 5-GGAGCTTGACGAGCAGCAGGCGGCGGCGCTCGAGGCCTTTCTGACG-3 and 5-CGTCAGAAAGGCCTCGAGCGCCGCCGCCTGCTGCTCGTCAAGCTCC-3 were designed to generate R47A/K48A/R49A-MEK1.MicroscopyâHEKB2 cells were seeded onto poly(l-lysine)-treated coverslips at â¼20% confluence. After treatment with indicated ligands, cells were fixed for 10 min in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde followed by three washes with Tris-buffered saline (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4). The coverslips were mounted to microscope slides with Immunomount. Cells were visualized using the Zeiss Pascal laser-scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochken, Germany). Fluorescent peptide entry into cells was done using an LSM510 laser-scanning microscope (Zeiss).In Vitro Pull-down Using Purified Proteinsâ1 nmol of purified GST or GST-Î²arrestin1 was mixed with an equal amount of HisMEK1 (Millipore) in 0.5 ml of binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% Triton X-100). The mixture was incubated for 1 h at 4 Â°C, and then 50 Î¼l of anti-polyhistidine-agarose beads (A5713; Sigma) were added in for an overnight incubation. Beads were collected by 10,000 Ã gav centrifugation for 1 min and washed three times with binding buffer before loading to an SDS-polyacrylamide gel for protein separation.Western Blotting and Protein EstimationâImmunoblotting was done as previously described (5.Baillie G.S. Sood A. McPhee I. Gall I. Perry S.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Houslay M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 940-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), using 25â50 Î¼g of cellular protein/well. After treatment, HEKÎ²2 cells or HEK cells were washed twice with PBS before being scraped into 3T3 lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, 2.5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.5) with added protease inhibitors (Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture; Roche Applied Science). Proteins were separated by PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose for Western blotting. Protein concentrations of cell lysates were determined with bovine serum albumin as a standard using Bradford reagent as previously described (25.Bolger G.B. McCahill A. Huston E. Cheung Y.F. McSorley T. Baillie G.S. Houslay M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49230-49238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Protein was routinely measured by the method of Bradford using bovine serum albumin as a standard.Immunoprecipitation of Target MoleculesâThis was done as described previously by us (29.MacKenzie S.J. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 571-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 30.Shepherd M.C. Baillie G.S. Stirling D.I. Houslay M.D. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2004; 142: 339-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Briefly, detergent-soluble proteins were isolated from cells by disruption in lysis buffer (1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.2, 10 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaH2PO4, 2H2O) containing complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) to 8% volume. Detergent-insoluble proteins were removed by centrifugation at 10,000 Ã gav for 10 min, and the soluble fraction was retained. Equal volumes of cell lysate containing 500 Î¼g of protein were cleared by incubation with 30 Î¼l of preimmune serum and/or 30 Î¼l of protein A slurry. The beads were then removed by centrifugation at 10,000 Ã gav for 10 min at 4 Â°C, and cleared lysate was incubated at 4 Â°C for 2 h with constant agitation with a volume of antiserum. Immunoglobulins were then isolated by incubation with protein A-coated Sepharose beads for 1 h before retrieval by refrigerated centrifugation at 10,000 Ã gav for 5 min. Target molecule-immunoglobulin conjugates attached to the beads were then washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) three times.Internalization of Î²2-AR AssayâBriefly, cells were grown to 80% confluence in Petri dishes and treated with 0.3 mg/ml disulfide-cleavable biotin (Pierce) in PBS at 4 Â°C for 30 min (5 ml/well). Cells were then washed with precooled PBS three times to cease biotinylation. The cells were then treated with the appropriate ligands, with or without peptides for the indicated times. Samples were washed with PBS two times, and the biotinylated receptors were stripped with stripping buffer (0.05 m glutathione, 0.3 m NaCl, 0.075 m NaOH, 1% FBS/newborn calf serum in PBS) at 4 Â°C for 30 min. Cell extracts were resuspended in radioimmune precipitation buffer (150 mm NaCl, 25 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4), and biotinylated receptors were immunologically isolated using immobilized NeatrAvidin (Pierce) beads at 4 Â°C overnight. Samples were then washed three times with radioimmune precipitation buffer or PBS, and samples were analyzed via SDS-PAGE. Total receptor amounts were visualized and quantified using anti-Î²2-AR antiserum (sc-569; Santa Cruz Biotechnology).Analysis by MicroscopyâSlides were examined using a fluorescent imaging microscope at a magnification of Ã43 and imaged for phase contrast, GFP fluorescence, and 4â²,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining. Images of three random fields of view were taken from each slide, and all cells within these areas were quantified. After correction for background, areas were outlined to define the intracellular compartment of the cell, using phase contrast to define the plasma membrane, and the number of cells present in each field of view was quantified using 4â²,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining of the nuclei of the cells. The image analysis software, Metamorph 7.0, was used to find spots within the intracellular compartment of the cell, and the number of spots per cell was quantified and used as an indication of the internalization of the Î²2-adrenoreceptor. Student's t test was used for statistical analysis.RESULTSPurified MEK1-GST Binds Directly to the Î²Arrestin Peptide ArrayâMEK1 is a 45-kDa MAPK kinase that activates ERK in a classic amplification cascade. Previous studies (10.Luttrell L.M. Roudabush F.L. Choy E.W. Miller W.E. Field M.E. Pierce K.L. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2449-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar) utilizing multiple transfection of key intermediates have indicated that MEK1 is able to interact with Î²arrestin. However, it is unclear from these reports as to whether this occurs directly or involves a bridging molecule, such as ERK, which is well known to bind to MEK and has been shown to associate directly with Î²-arrestin (19.DeFea K.A.

Houslay M.D. Milligan G. Biochem. J. 2008; 413: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Recently, evidence has emerged suggesting that MEK may bind to both the N and C domains of Î²arrestin1, although the exact nature of the binding sites remains to be determined (24.Song, X., Coffa, S., Fu, H., and Gurevich, V. V. (2008) J. Biol. Chem.Google Scholar).In order to determine whether MEK1 has the potential to interact directly with Î²arrestin, we first employed peptide array analysis. This provides a novel and powerful technology for gaining insight into the basis of specific protein-protein interactions. Indeed, we have used this to considerable advantage to exhaustively map sites of interaction between both of the scaffolding proteins, Î²arrestin (27.Baillie G.S. Adams D.R. Bhari N. Houslay T.M. Vadrevu S. Meng D. Li X. Dunlop A. Milligan G. Bolger G.B. Klussmann E. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 2007; 404: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and RACK1 (7.Bolger G.B. Baillie G.S. Li X. Lynch M.J. Herzyk P. Mohamed A. Mitchell L.H. McCahill A. Hundsrucker C. Klussmann E. Adams D.R. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 2006; 398: 23-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), with the cAMP-hydrolyzing PDE4D5 isoform. These were confirmed by mutagenesis analyzed through both pull-down and two-hybrid studies (25.Bolger G.B. McCahill A. Huston E. Cheung Y.F. McSorley T. Baillie G.S. Houslay M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49230-49238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Here we have generated a library of overlapping peptides (25-mers), each shifted by 5 amino acids, which spans the entire sequence of Î²arrestin1. These were spot-synthesized on cellulose membranes to generate an immobilized peptide library that was then probed with a purified, recombinant GST fusion protein of active MEK1. Binding of MEK1 to individual peptide spots was assessed immunologically, with positive interactions identified as dark spots (Fig. 1a). A cluster of peptides (spots 3â6) was observed for GST-MEK1 binding but not GST alone, and that yielding the strongest signal (spot 6; Fig. 1a) was evaluated further.In order to gain insight into the amino acids involved in allowing MEK1 to bind to this region of Î²arrestin1, we generated a family of peptides derived from the âspot 6â 25-mer parent peptide whose sequence reflected amino acids Asp26âGlu50 of Î²arrestin1. The 25-mer peptide progeny of this parent peptide each had a single substitution, to alanine, of successive amino acids in the sequence to form a scanning peptide array (Fig. 1b). Using this analysis, we observed that MEK1 binding to the 25-mer Asp26âGlu50 Î²arrestin peptide was ablated upon alanine substitution of Asp26 and Asp29 (Fig. 1b). Binding of MEK1 was also ablated when the various amino acids in the region Asp26 to His30 were all replaced with alanine residues but not when the run of amino acids from Tyr46 to Glu50 were similarly substituted with alanine residues.To reinforce our findings from peptide array analysis, we attempted to show that MEK1 and Î²arrestin1 could directly interact in vitro. After mixing purified fusion proteins of His-MEK1 with GST-Î²arrestin1 or GST alone, we pulled down the His tag on MEK1 and evaluated co-immunoprecipitating species by Western blotting (Fig. 2a). GST-Î²arrestin1, but not GST, co-purified with His-MEK1, confirming the notion that the MEK1-Î²arrestin1 association is direct and is not dependent on other putative members of the signaling complex. In order to determine if this DXXD motif does indeed play an important role in defining the interaction between MEK1 and Î²arrestin, we mutated Asp26 and Asp29 to alanine in a FLAG epitope-tagged Î²arrestin1 construct and evaluated whether this altered the ability of MEK1 to co-immunoprecipitate with Î²arrestin in cell lysates where they are co-expressed (Fig. 2b). Doing this, we see that although anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates of FLAG-tagged Î²arrestin1 pulled down endogenous MEK1, only 8.3 Â± 3.9% (mean; n = 3) of MEK remains associated with the FLAG-tagged D26A/D29A-Î²arrestin1 mutant construct (Fig. 2b). There is specificity in this interaction, since both the wild-type and D26A/D29A mutant forms of FLAG-tagged Î²arrestin1 acted to pull-down equal amounts of PDE4D (Fig. 2), whose binding site on Î²arrestin does not involve either Asp26 or Asp29 (27.Baillie G.S. Adams D.R. Bhari N. Houslay T.M. Vadrevu S. Meng D. Li X. Dunlop A. Milligan G. Bolger G.B. Klussmann E. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 2007; 404: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). These analyses confirm the peptide array studies in indicating that both Asp26 and Asp29 play a key role in underpinning the interaction of MEK1 with Î²arrestin1.FIGURE 2Mutation of Î²arrestin1 Asp26 and Asp29 to Ala ablates MEK1 binding to Î²arrestin1. a, fusion proteins of His-MEK1 and GST-Î²arrestin1 or GST alone were mixed before His-MEK was pulled down using anti-His-agarose beads.

MIF exists preformed in cytoplasmic pools and exhibits an intrinsic tautomerase and oxidoreductase activity. MIF levels are elevated in the serum of animals and patients with infection or different inflammatory disorders. To elucidate how MIF actions are controlled, we searched for endogenous MIF-interacting proteins with the potential to interfere with key MIF functions. Using in vivo biotin-tagging and endogenous co-immunoprecipitation, the ribosomal protein S19 (RPS19) was identified as a novel MIF binding partner. Surface plasmon resonance and pulldown experiments with wild type and mutant MIF revealed a direct physical interaction of the two proteins (KD = 1.3 Ã 10-6 m). As RPS19 is released in inflammatory lesions by apoptotic cells, we explored whether it affects MIF function and inhibits its binding to receptors CD74 and CXCR2. Low doses of RPS19 were found to strongly inhibit MIF-CD74 interaction. Furthermore, RPS19 significantly compromised CXCR2-dependent MIF-triggered adhesion of monocytes to endothelial cells under flow conditions. We, therefore, propose that RPS19 acts as an extracellular negative regulator of MIF.

A pivotal step in the inflammatory response is the chemokine-governed adherence of monocytes to the endothelial lining which is then followed by their egress from the vasculature at the affected site. Earlier data from MIF-/- mice illustrate a role of MIF in leukocyte recruitment that was recently substantiated by the finding that MIF serves as a chemoattractant for monocytes and T cells by directly binding to the chemokine receptors CXCR2 and CXCR4 (14Bernhagen J. Krohn R. Lue H. Gregory J.L. Zernecke A. Koenen R.R. Dewor M. Georgiev I. Schober A. Leng L. Kooistra T. Fingerle-Rowson G. Ghezzi P. Kleemann R. McColl S.R. Bucala R. Hickey M.J. Weber C. Nat.

Immunol. 2006; 177: 8072-8079Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). On the cell surface MIF also associates with CD74 (invariant chain of major histocompatibility complex class II) which colocalizes with CXCR2 (14Bernhagen J. Krohn R. Lue H. Gregory J.L. Zernecke A. Koenen R.R. Dewor M. Georgiev I. Schober A. Leng L. Kooistra T. Fingerle-Rowson G. Ghezzi P. Kleemann R. McColl S.R. Bucala R. Hickey M.J. Weber C. Nat.

Med. 2003; 197: 1467-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). Interaction with different surface molecules is thought to partly explain the wide impact of MIF on cellular pathways. Despite its role as a key mediator in immune and inflammatory diseases, very little is known of how MIF action is regulated and terminated. Accordingly, we searched for endogenous molecules with the ability to control key steps of MIF signaling (i.e. receptor binding and/or receptor-associated functions). In this study, we identified ribosomal protein S19 (RPS19), a component of the small ribosomal subunit that is also released by apoptotic cells (17Nishimura T. Horino K. Nishiura H. Shibuya Y. Hiraoka T. Tanase S. Yamamoto T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 129: 445-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), as such a candidate. Identification of MIF-interacting Partners by Coimmunoprecipitation-Mouse NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (PAA Laboratories, CoÌlbe, Germany) and antibiotics. Cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 (1% IGEPAL CA-630) buffer containing protease inhibitors. Lysed cells were disrupted by passage through a 21-gauge needle and subjected to sonication by two 10-s bursts at 200-300 watts separated by a 10-s cooling period. After centrifugation at 12,000 Ã g at 4 Â°C for 10 min, the supernatant was precleared with 30 Î¼l of protein G-Sepharose 4B Fast Flow beads (GE Healthcare) on a rotating wheel at 4 Â°C for 1 h before incubation with either rabbit anti-rat MIF antibody or preimmune serum immobilized on 30 Î¼l of protein G-Sepharose commenced at 4 Â°C for 2 h. After 5 washes with lysis buffer for 10 min each, beads were resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer and boiled for 10 min. Immunoprecipitates were separated on a NuPAGE 4-12% Novex Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen) and stained with colloidal Coomassie staining solution (Sigma). Identification of MIF-interacting Partners by in Vivo Biotinylation of Tagged MIF-The method of de Boer et al. (18de Boer E. Rodriguez P. Bonte E. Krijgsveld J. Katsantoni E. Heck A. Grosveld F. Strouboulis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7480-7485Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) was employed using the modified tagging construct pN3-CTB developed by Rischitor (19Rischitor G. Transcription Factor Sp3 as Target for SUMOylation in Vivo. Philipps-UniversitaÌt Marburg, Marburg, Germany2005Google Scholar). The rat MIF cDNA insert was produced by standard PCR using the upstream primer CGAATTCCGCCACCATGCCTATGTTCATCGTG (EcoRI site in bold) and the downstream primer GATGTCGACAGCGAAGGTGGAACCGTTCCA (SalI site in bold) and a pGEX-4T-2-MIF full-length expression construct (48Kim M. Expression Cloning and Purification of Macrophage Migration Inhibitory Factor. Philipps-University, Marburg, Germany2003Google Scholar) as template. pN3-CTB-MIF was constructed by cloning the EcoRI/SalI-restricted PCR fragment into pN3-CTB. For stable transfection, pBudCE4.1-birA (18de Boer E. Rodriguez P. Bonte E. Krijgsveld J. Katsantoni E. Heck A. Grosveld F. Strouboulis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7480-7485Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) and pN3-CTB-MIF were linearized with XhoI and Eco 01091I, respectively, and transfected together or individually (pBudCE4.1-birA) into NIH 3T3 cells using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). Antibiotic selection started with 800 Î¼g/ml Geneticin (for pN3-CTB-MIF) and 600 Î¼g/ml zeocin (for pBudCE4.1-birA) and was successively reduced in three steps down to 100 Î¼g/ml Geneticin and 150 Î¼g/ml zeocin after 4 weeks. After 5-8 weeks clones were isolated using small sterile filter discs soaked in trypsin solution. Clones were examined for expression of a biotinylated 22-kDa MIF fusion protein using immunoblots with rabbit anti-rat-MIF antiserum and streptavidin horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Dako, Hamburg, Germany). One of the clones that strongly expressed the MIF fusion protein and one control clone expressing birA only were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, biotin (0.1 mg/liter), Geneticin (100 Î¼g/ml), and zeocin (150 Î¼g/ml) at 37 Â°C. Cells were lysed in 1% IGEPAL CA-630 (v/v), 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, and proteinase inhibitors and applied to streptavidin-agarose beads (Novagen; 200 Î¼l of bead slurry per mg of cell extract). After 1 h on a rocking platform, beads were washed 3 times with lysis buffer. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling for 10 min in SDS sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE on a 4-12% NuPAGE Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen), and stained with colloidal Coomassie Blue (Sigma). Both lanes were cut into 12 gel slices, and proteins in all slices were digested with trypsin (20Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7822) Google Scholar). Extracted peptides were separated and sequenced by liquid chromatography-coupled electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectroscopy on a quadrupole-time of flight (TOF) instrument (Q-TOF Ultima, Waters) under standard conditions. Proteins were identified by comparing peptide fragment spectra against all entries in the NCBI nr data base using MASCOT as search engine. Identification of RPS19 by Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization (MALDI)-Mass Spectroscopy Fingerprint Analysis and Peptide Matching-A 16-kDa band identified by co-immunoprecipitation was excised from the gel. The gel piece was washed once with water and twice with 50 mm ammonium hydrogen carbonate:acetonitrile (1:1) and acetonitrile, alternately. Gel pieces were re-swollen in a minimal volume of a 10 ng/Î¼l trypsin solution (sequencing grade, Roche Diagnostics) in 25 mm ammonium hydrogen carbonate and incubated for 16 h at 37 Â°C. Peptides were extracted with 5 Î¼l of 1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid containing 5 mm octylglycoside. 2 Î¼l of the solution were applied to a thin layer of Î±-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid on an AnchorChip target (Bruker Daltonik, Bremen, Germany). After 10 min the supernatant was removed, and the spot was washed twice with 2 Î¼l of 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. Mass fingerprints of tryptic digests were obtained by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry using an Ultraflexâ¢ TOF/TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonik). The identified protein was verified by analyzing selected peptides in LIFT mode (tandem mass spectroscopy), and fragment masses were also submitted to MASCOT. Expression and Purification of Wild Type and Mutant MIF Proteins-Recombinant rat MIF that differs from mouse MIF by only one amino acid (rat MIF, Ser-54; mouse MIF, Asn-54) was expressed and purified as previously described (21Berndt K. Kim M. Meinhardt A. Klug J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2008; 307: 265-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Possible endotoxin contamination was removed using Detoxi-Gel (Pierce) which was also applied to the wild type human MIF preparation (see below). Human MIF and MIF mutant proteins were obtained from 1 liter of LB cultures of Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) transformed with constructs for wild type (wt) MIF and mutants P2A MIF (N-terminal amino acid alanine 2 exchanged for proline), Î4 MIF (N-terminal four amino acids deleted), and C60S MIF (amino acid cysteine 60 replaced by serine) (22Kleemann R. Rorsman H. Rosengren E. Mischke R. Mai N.T. Bernhagen J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 7183-7193Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Expression was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-Î²-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h. Cells were harvested, and a lysate was prepared exactly as described (23Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning.3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York2001: 15.51Google Scholar). Cell lysates were sonicated on ice by five 10-s bursts using a microtip (Sonoplus, Bandelin, Berlin, Germany) and centrifuged at 17,000 Ã g at 4 Â°C for 30 min. wtMIF and P2A MIF and Î4 MIF mutants were purified from the soluble fraction of the lysate, whereas the C60S MIF mutant was purified via an inclusion body preparation. The Î4 MIF mutant was present in comparable portions in soluble and inclusion body fraction alike. Soluble proteins were precipitated with 70% ammonium sulfate (saturation), taken up in PBS, and chromatographed on a Sephacryl S100 HiPrep 16/60 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) using an AÌKTAbasic UPC10 HPLC system (GE Healthcare). Positive fractions were pooled and passed over directly coupled 1-ml Resource S/Mono Q 5/50 columns (GE Healthcare). In PBS wtMIF, P2A MIF and Î4 MIF proteins are in the flow-through with the majority of impurities binding to the column. For the C60S MIF mutant the pellet of the initial lysate was resuspended in 25 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, and washed 4 times in the same buffer. The washed inclusion bodies were denatured in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 100 mm dithiothreitol in PBS. The solubilized protein was dialyzed against 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride in PBS, cleared by centrifugation, and passed over directly coupled Resource S/Mono Q columns as described above. All proteins had a purity of more than 98% as assessed by SDS-PAGE. The identity of all purified proteins was confirmed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry as described above. Human wtMIF, P2A MIF, and C60S MIF had the N-terminal methionine removed due to a second cleavable residue as predicted (24Sherman F. Stewart J.W. Tsunasawa S. BioEssays. 1985; 3: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), whereas the Î4 MIF mutant had retained this methionine. Because of the internal mutation, the C60S mutant could not be confirmed. Expression and Purification of GST-RPS19 and RPS19-His-Mouse RPS19 cDNA clone IRAKp961E1430Q was obtained from ImaGenes (Berlin, Germany). The RPS19 cDNA was amplified by PCR with Pfu polymerase (Promega) using forward primer 5â²-CGAGGAATTCCCATGCCCGGAGTTACTG-3â² and reverse primer 5â²-CGCCTCGAGTAATGCTTCTTGTTGGC-3â² for the glutathione S-transferase (GST) tag vector and forward primer 5â²-CGCCATATGCCCGGAGTTACTGTAAAA-3â² and reverse primer 5â²-GCGAAGCTTATGCTTCTTGTTGGCAGC-3â² for the His tag vector (introduced restriction sites are underlined). EcoRI- and XhoI-restricted PCR fragments were ligated into pGEX-4T-2 (GE Healthcare) yielding pGST-RPS19. Because of an internal NdeI site within the RPS19 cDNA, pET21a(+) (Merck) was restricted with NdeI, blunted, restricted with HindIII, and ligated to the HindIII-restricted PCR fragment. Both inserts plus flanking regions were validated by DNA sequencing (Seqlab, GoÌttingen, Germany). GST-RPS19 and RPS19-His were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) by induction with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-Î²-d-galactopyranoside at 37 Â°C for 3 h. For the GST-tagged RPS19 protein, cells were lysed in PBS by sonication and treated with 1% Triton X-100 for 30 min. After centrifugation at 12,000 Ã g for 15 min, the supernatant containing GST-RPS19 was subjected to glutathione-Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare) chromatography. The purity of the eluted protein was higher than 95% as estimated by SDS-PAGE. For the His-tagged protein, bacterial cells were lysed with lysozyme followed by sonication, and the native protein was purified from the lysate by standard Ni-NTA chromatography. Bound protein was eluted with 50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, pH 8.0, and dialyzed against PBS, pH 7.8, containing 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Surface Plasmon Resonance-Biosensor analyses were performed on a BIACORE X system (GE Healthcare). Recombinant MIF dissolved in 0.01 m sodium acetate, pH 4.5, was covalently attached to a CM5 sensor chip (GE Healthcare) by the amine coupling method according to the manufacturer's instructions. Final levels of immobilization were â¼5000 response units. 1000 response units correspond to 10 Î¼g/Î¼l on a CM5 chip. Analyses were performed at 25 Â°C using 0.01 m HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, and 0.005% surfactant P20 as a driving buffer at a flow rate of 20 Î¼l/min. All experiments were carried out at 25 Â°C at a constant flow rate of 20 Î¼l/min HBS-EP buffer. 40 Î¼l of the analyte (RPS19) diluted in HBS-EP buffer (GE Healthcare) were injected over the immobilized MIF followed by a 2-min period when buffer was passed over the surface. Five concentrations of RPS19 were passed over the chip (62.5, 125, 250, 500, and 1000 nm). Preparation of Antibodies against RPS19 and MIF and Double Immunofluorescence-Antibodies against His-tagged RPS19 or wild type rat MIF were raised in New Zealand White rabbits. In the case of anti-RPS19, serum samples were affinity-purified using His-tagged RPS19 immobilized on Ni-NTA-agarose (25Gu J. Stephenson C.G. Iadarola M.J. Biotechniques. 1994; 17 (260, and 262): 257PubMed Google Scholar). The purified RPS19 immunoglobulins were dialyzed against water for 1 h and against PBS overnight at 4 Â°C. A second chicken anti-RPS19 antibody was obtained from Lydie Da Costa (26Da Costa L. Tchernia G. Gascard P. Lo A. Meerpohl J. Niemeyer C. Chasis J.A. Fixler J. Mohandas N. Blood. 2003; 101: 5039-5045Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The MIF antibody is available through Invitrogen (#36-7401). Cells were cultured on coverslips and fixed with ice-cold methanol for 10 min. Blocking for 1 h in 5% bovine serum albumin (w/v) and 5% (v/v) normal horse serum was followed by incubation with rabbit anti-mouse RPS19 (1:200) decorated with donkey anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with Cy3 (1:1000) and mouse anti-MIF (1:200, clone 3D9, available by NIH resource sharing) detected by donkey anti-mouse IgG conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (1:1000). Primary antibodies were applied overnight at 4 Â°C, and both secondary antibodies were incubated for 1 h at room temperature. 4,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole was used for nuclear staining. Images were acquired with a confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica TCS SP2). Pulldown Assays-Biotinylation of rat MIF was performed using the ECL protein biotinylation module (GE Healthcare) according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. Non-reacted succinimide ester was separated from biotinylated MIF using Sephadex G-25 columns. Biotinylated MIF was eluted with PBS, pH 7.5, and 2.5 Î¼g were immobilized on 30 Î¼l (50% slurry) of monomeric avidin beads (Pierce) by incubation in 500 Î¼l of PBS at room temperature on a rotating wheel for 30 min. To completely remove free biotinylated MIF, beads were washed with PBS and then incubated in 500 Î¼l of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% IGEPAL CA-630) with increasing amounts of GST-RPS19 (50, 100, and 200 ng) on a rotating wheel at 4 Â°C for 1 h. As a control, uncoated avidin beads were incubated with the same amounts of GST-RPS19 alone. Beads were then washed 5 times with lysis buffer and finally boiled in Laemmli sample buffer for 5 min. Protein complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane, and detected with anti-GST antibody conjugated with peroxidase. Similarly, RPS19-His (2 Î¼g) was immobilized on Ni-NTA-agarose beads, washed with PBS, and incubated for 1 h with different amounts of recombinant rat MIF or 2 Î¼g of human wild type MIF or P2A MIF, C60S MIF, and Î4 MIF proteins. As a control, MIF proteins alone were incubated with Ni-NTA-agarose beads. After extensive washing with lysis buffer as described previously or radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% IGEPAL CA-630, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) in the case of human MIF and MIF mutants, proteins bound to the beads were boiled in Laemmli sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and stained with colloidal Coomassie (Sigma) or blotted and probed for RPS19, stripped, and reprobed for MIF. l-Dopachrome Methyl Ester Tautomerase Assay-The substrate l-dopachrome methyl ester was freshly prepared before each measurement as described but without HPLC purification (27Bendrat K. Al-Abed Y. Callaway D.J. Peng T. Calandra T. Metz C.N. Bucala R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15356-15362Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Enzymatic activity was determined in an 800-Î¼l assay reaction obtained by mixing 400 Î¼l of PBS containing recombinant rat wtMIF at a concentration of 1 Î¼m with 400 Î¼l of crude l-dopachrome methyl ester substrate. In reactions that contained MIF and RPS19, both proteins were preincubated in 400 Î¼l of PBS for 1 h before measurement. As control, SCGB 2A1-His (28Xiao F. Mirwald A. Papaioannou M. Baniahmad A. Klug J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 2964-2978Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), a protein of similar size and with the same tag, was used. Enzyme activity was measured by monitoring the reaction kinetics at 475 nm in an Ultrospec 2100 pro spectrophotometer (GE Healthcare). These conditions resulted in fast and non-linear kinetics leading to a quantitative turnover of the substrate over a time period of 1 min after reaction start. Therefore, the decrease in absorbance from 0 to 4 s, i.e. the initial reaction rate, was calculated and defined as tautomerase activity. Unpaired t tests were performed to compare the reaction rates +/- RPS19. Differences with a value of p < 0.05 were considered statistically different. Flow Chamber Adhesion Assay-Human aortic endothelial cells (HAoEC; PromoCell, Heidelberg, Germany) were maintained in PromoCell medium and used at passages 3-5. Mono-Mac6 cells (a gift of Prof. H. W. L. Ziegler-Heitbrock, University of Leicester) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 1% non-essential amino acids, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 10 Î¼g/ml human insulin as described (29Weber C. Aepfelbacher M. Haag H. Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W. Weber P.C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 852-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The laminar flow assays were performed as described previously (14Bernhagen J. Krohn R. Lue H. Gregory J.L. Zernecke A. Koenen R.R. Dewor M. Georgiev I. Schober A. Leng L. Kooistra T. Fingerle-Rowson G. Ghezzi P. Kleemann R. McColl S.R. Bucala R. Hickey M.J. Weber C. Nat. Med. 2007; 13: 587-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar). Briefly, HAoEC were grown to confluence in 35-mm dishes and preincubated with MIF (50 ng/ml) and RPS19-His (6 Î¼g/ml) or control buffer for 2 h at 37 Â°C, 5% CO2. The dishes were assembled at the bottom of a parallel wall flow chamber and mounted on the stage of an Olympus IX71 inverted microscope with 20Ã and 40Ã phase contrast objectives. MonoMac6 cells (1 Ã 106/ml) labeled with calcein-AM were pretreated with a blocking antibody against CXCR2 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) or matching isotype control IgG (3 Î¼g/ml) and resuspended in assay buffer (1 Ã Hanks' balanced salt solution, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.5% bovine serum albumin). The cell suspension was supplemented at 37 Â°C with 1 mm Ca2+/Mg2+ shortly before perfusing 5 Ã 105 cells/ml into the flow chamber at a shear rate of 1.5 dyn/cm2 for 2 min. The number of adherent monocytes was analyzed in multiple high-power fields using the cell M software (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Data are expressed as the means Â± S.E. Student's t tests (two-sided, unpaired) were performed to compare experimental groups. Differences with a value of p < 0.05 were considered statistically different. MIF-RPS19 Capture Assay-The assay was performed as published (30Kamir D. Zierow S. Leng L. Cho Y. Diaz Y. Griffith J. McDonald C. Merk M. Mitchell R.A. Trent J. Chen Y. Kwong Y.K. Xiong H. Vermeire J. Cappello M. McMahon-Pratt D. Walker J. Bernhagen J. Lolis E. Bucala R. J. Immunol. 2008; 180: 8250-8261Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Briefly, 96-well plates were coated with 60 Î¼l/well of 26 ng/Î¼l purified soluble CD74 (amino acids 73-232) at 4 Â°C overnight. After washing 4 times with 250 Î¼l/well Tris-buffered saline, the plates were incubated with 100 Î¼l/well Superblock (Pierce) at 4 Â°C overnight. Various concentrations of RPS19 were preincubated with 2 ng/Î¼l biotin-MIF (biotin labeling kit from Roche Applied Science) for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. The Superblock was removed and replaced with 120 Î¼l/well of the RPS19 protein/biotin-MIF pre-incubated mixture, and incubation was continued in the dark at 4 Â°C for overnight. After washing the plate 4 times, 60 Î¼l/well of streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase (R&D) was added for 1 h at room temperature in the dark followed by washing of the plate before adding 60 Î¼l/well of PNPP (Sigma) and allowing color to develop in the dark at room temperature and reading at 405 nm. For control, human MIF was denatured by incubation at 100 Â°C for 5 min. Identification of RPS19 as a MIF-interacting Protein-A far Western analysis was performed under reducing conditions to evaluate possible sources for the identification of MIF-interacting proteins. As each cell type (PC12, NIH 3T3) or tissue extract (rat and mouse testis) examined exhibited a similar pattern of reactive bands (data not shown), co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments were performed with endogenous lysates of NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. In co-IPs with a polyclonal MIF antibody a number of putative MIF-interacting proteins were co-precipitated. A prominent band at 16 kDa was readily identified in the anti-MIF precipitate but not in a reaction with an isotype control antibody (Fig. 1A). This 16-kDa protein was analyzed by tryptic in-gel digestion followed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and identified as ribosomal protein S19 (RPS19). Confirmation of this finding was provided when the same IP samples were blotted and probed with an RPS19 antibody, stripped, and then re-probed with an antibody against MIF (Fig. 1B). Both proteins were detected in the anti-MIF co-IP sample, whereas the control-IP was negative. Further verification was obtained when RPS19 could also be identified as a MIF-interacting protein in a different screen utilizing a tagged MIF fusion protein that was expressed in NIH 3T3 cells. The C-terminal tag was a peptide that is recognized and biotinylated in vivo by the bacterial birA biotin ligase that was stably co-expressed in the same NIH 3T3 clone (18de Boer E. Rodriguez P. Bonte E. Krijgsveld J. Katsantoni E. Heck A. Grosveld F. Strouboulis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7480-7485Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Biotinylated MIF and associated MIF-interacting proteins were purified in a single step by binding to streptavidin-agarose beads and separated by SDS-PAGE. A stable NIH 3T3 clone that expresses birA ligase only was used as control. Both SDS-PAGE lanes were cut into 12 slices, and"
https://openalex.org/W1985000689,"DLC1 (deleted in liver cancer 1), which encodes a Rho GTPase-activating protein (Rho-GAP), is a potent tumor suppressor gene that is frequently inactivated in several human cancers. DLC1 is a multidomain protein that has been shown previously to bind members of the tensin gene family. Here we show that p120Ras-GAP (Ras-GAP; also known as RASA1) interacts and extensively colocalizes with DLC1 in focal adhesions. The binding was mapped to the SH3 domain located in the N terminus of Ras-GAP and to the Rho-GAP catalytic domain located in the C terminus of the DLC1. In vitro analyses with purified proteins determined that the isolated Ras-GAP SH3 domain inhibits DLC1 Rho-GAP activity, suggesting that Ras-GAP is a negative regulator of DLC1 Rho-GAP activity. Consistent with this possibility, we found that ectopic overexpression of Ras-GAP in a Ras-GAP-insensitive tumor line impaired the growth-suppressing activity of DLC1 and increased RhoA activity in vivo. Our observations expand the complexity of proteins that regulate DLC1 function and define a novel mechanism of the cross talk between Ras and Rho GTPases.1R01CA129610"

An understanding of the internal electron transfer steps and their Na+ dependence is an essential prerequisite for such studies. To this end, we analyzed the reduction kinetics of the wild type Na+-NQR, as well as site-directed mutants of the enzyme, which lack specific cofactors. NADH and ubiquinol were used as reductants in separate experiments, and a full spectrum UV-visible stopped flow kinetic method was employed. The results make it possible to define the complete sequence of redox carriers in the electrons transfer pathway through the enzyme. Electrons flow from NADH to quinone through the FAD in subunit F, the 2Fe-2S center, the FMN in subunit C, the FMN in subunit B, and finally riboflavin. The reduction of the FMNC to its anionic flavosemiquinone state is the first Na+-dependent process, suggesting that reduction of this site is linked to Na+ uptake. During the reduction reaction, two FMNs are transformed to their anionic flavosemiquinone in a single kinetic step. Subsequently, FMNC is converted to the flavohydroquinone, accounting for the single anionic flavosemiquinone radical in the fully reduced enzyme. A model of the electron transfer steps in the catalytic cycle of Na+-NQR is presented to account for the kinetic and spectroscopic data.

The Na+-pumping NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase (Na+-NQR) 2The abbreviations used are: Na+-NQR, Na+-pumping NADH:quinone oxidoreductase; F, oxidized flavin; F.Â¯, anionic flavosemiquinone; FH., neutral flavosemiquinone; FH2, flavohydroquinone; FMNB, covalently bound FMN in NqrB; FMNC, covalently bound FMN in NqrC. is a molecular energy transducer present in the membrane of many marine and pathogenic bacteria, including Vibrio cholerae (1Barquera B.

The enzyme accepts electrons from NADH and donates them to ubiquinone. This redox reaction releases a significant amount of energy, which is used to pump Na+ across the cell membrane, creating a Na+ gradient as well as an electrical potential (2Dibrov P.A. Kostryko V.A.

Na+-NQR catalyzes the same redox reaction as the H+-pumping NADH:quinone oxidoreductase (complex I), but there is nothing to indicate a common mechanism. The two proteins have significantly different cofactor compositions and do not share any homology beyond substrate/cofactor motifs. In fact the pumping stoichiometry of the two enzymes is reportedly different; Na+-NQR translocates one Na+/electron, whereas as complex I moves at least 2 H+/e- (4Bogachev A.V. Murtazina R.A.

In Na+-NQR electrons are carried through the enzyme by means of at least five redox cofactors: a noncovalently bound FAD and a 2Fe-2S center, in the NqrF subunit, where the binding site for NADH is also located, two covalently attached FMNs in subunits B and C (FMNB and FMNC, respectively), and a noncovalently bound riboflavin that has not been definitely localized but that is believed to reside in the B or C subunit (see Fig. 1) (7Barquera B.

Describing the way in which these redox cofactors work together to move electrons from NADH to quinone is a necessary step in understanding how Na+-NQR functions as a molecular energy converter. It is important to know the sequence of redox carriers along the path taken by electrons as they flow through the enzyme, as well as the kinetics and energetics of each step and how they are influenced by Na+ and the electrical potential. The reaction of the oxidized enzyme with excess NADH, leading to fully reduced state, can be used to investigate the internal electron transfer processes in Na+-NQR. This is not the physiological reaction of the enzyme, which probably never becomes fully reduced during steady state turnover with NADH and quinone. Nevertheless, this provides a useful way to apply transient kinetic measurements to the mechanism of the enzyme. Bogachev et al. (13Bogachev A.V. Bertsova Y.V. Ruuge E.K. Wikstrom M. Verkhovsky M.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1556: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) used this method to study the reduction of the wild type enzyme from Vibrio harveyi. These studies led to a model of the reaction, which takes into account the 2Fe-2S center and three flavin redox cofactors. However, assignment of kinetic processes to specific cofactors is still an open question. The flavins in Na+-NQR, now known to be four, can all potentially give rise to the same visible and EPR spectra. Na+-NQR can exhibit three different flavosemiquinone radical EPR signals, depending on the overall oxidation state of the enzyme: a neutral flavosemiquinone in the oxidized (as prepared) enzyme, an anionic flavosemiquinone (I) in the fully reduced enzyme, and a second, spectroscopically distinct, anionic flavosemiquinone (II) in the partially reduced enzyme. By studying site-directed mutants that result in the loss of specific cofactors, we have recently assigned anionic flavosemiquinone ItoFMNB, anionic flavosemiquinone II to FMNC, and the neutral flavosemiquinone to the riboflavin cofactor (8Juarez O.

Nilges M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36482-36491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To define the roles of the different redox cofactors in the kinetics of the reduction of the enzyme, we have used stopped flow methods to study a series of mutants in which cofactors have been removed, individually or pair-wise. The mutants include ones that remove: the 2Fe-2S center (NqrF-C76A), FMNB (NqrB-T236Y), FMNC (NqrC-T225Y), and a double mutant, which lacks both FMNs (NqrB-T236Y/NqrC-T225Y). The results indicate that electrons follow a linear pathway through the cofactors of the enzyme without significant parallel flow. Each mutation appears to interrupt smooth electron flow through the enzyme at a different point. The results allow each of the redox cofactors of Na+-NQR to be assigned a place in the sequence of electron carriers and to distinguish which processes are controlled by kinetics or thermodynamics. The results also account for the multiple flavosemiquinone radicals observed in different equilibrium redox states of the enzyme, in terms of transitions observed during rapid reduction (9Barquera B.

On this basis, we present a model of electron flow in Na+-NQR and of the steps coupled to Na+ translocation in the enzyme. Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions-V. cholerae expressing the recombinant wild type Na+-NQR and mutants were grown as reported previously (1Barquera B. Hellwig P. Zhou W. Morgan J.E. Hase C.C.

Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 12322-12330Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Protein Purification-Wild type and mutant Na+-NQR proteins were purified using affinity chromatography (1Barquera B. Hellwig P. Zhou W. Morgan J.E. Hase C.C. Gosink K.K. Nilges M. Bruesehoff P.J. Roth A. Lancaster C.R. Gennis R.B. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3781-3789Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was measured with the Bicichonic acid assay (Pierce). Total flavin concentration was determined at 450 nm in denatured enzyme preparations by the addition of 6 m guanidine. The flavin/protein molar ratios for wild type Na+-NQR, NqrB-T236Y, NqrC-T225Y, NqrB-T236Y/NqrC-T225Y, and NqrF-C76A were 3.6 Â± 0.2, 2.5 Â± 0.3, 2.8 Â± 0.4, 1.7 Â± 0.3, and 3.7 Â± 0.4 (7Barquera B.

Chem. 2008; 283: 33162-33167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Stopped Flow Experiments-Fast spectrophotometric measurements were performed using an Applied Photophysics SX.18MV-R stopped flow instrument equipped with a PD.1 diode array (diode separation of 2.17 nm) that is capable of acquiring spectra over the range from 185 to 715.5 nm at a rate of 1/1.28 ms. Wild type and mutant enzymes were desalted in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.05% (w/v) n-dodecyl Î²-maltoside and were rapidly mixed (1:1) in buffer containing either: 600 Î¼m K2-NADH (potassium salt); K2-NADH, 200 mm NaCl or 2 mm ubiquinol-1, 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithionite. Ubiquinol-1 was prepared from ubiquinone-1 as reported in Ref.16Trumpower B.L. Edwards C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 8697-8706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar using sodium dithionite or sodium borohydrate as reductants. Data Analysis-The stopped flow measurements were repeated at least 12 times per experimental condition and tested in three different enzyme preparations. To remove noise caused by the jitter of the xenon lamp and other sources, a temporal base-line correction was carried out. The absorbance data in the range 650-720 nm, where the redox reactions do not make a significant contribution, were averaged and subtracted from the spectrum of each time point. The resulting data matrices were averaged in MATLAB. The averaged matrices were analyzed in Applied Photophysics PC Pro-K software for global analysis of multiwavelength kinetic data. The results were fitted using reaction schemes of 1-4 steps (depending on the mutant tested) with linear or multi-branched pathway models. In all cases the most parsimonious fits were obtained with linear models (judged from the residual plots and variance of the fits). The reaction with NADH, which transforms the oxidized enzyme to its fully reduced form, is a useful model reaction that allows rapid kinetic methods to be applied to study electron transfer in Na+-NQR. The reduction of wild type Na+-NQR by NADH has been studied by stopped flow measurements, and several intermediate steps in the reaction have been resolved. However, it must be borne in mind that this is not the physiological turnover reaction of the enzyme and that Na+-NQR probably never becomes fully reduced during steady state turnover. This can be seen in the fact that in the wild type enzyme, the third and fourth kinetic phases of this reaction have rates of 35 and 0.7 s-1, respectively (measured at 4 Â°C; see below), both far lower than the 150 s-1 steady state turnover rate under comparable conditions with NADH and ubiquinone. Nevertheless, the reaction of the fully oxidized enzyme with NADH in the absence of an oxidizing substrate provides a useful way to apply transient kinetic measurements and analysis to the mechanism of this enzyme. We have applied this method to study a series of mutants in which redox cofactors have been specifically removed. These mutants include ones that lack the following cofactors: 1) FMNB (NqrB-T236Y) 2), FMNC (NqrC-T225Y), 3) both of these FMN cofactors (double mutant NqrB-T236Y/NqrC-T225Y), and 4) the 2Fe-2S center in NqrF (NqrF-C76A) (Fig. 1). Fast Kinetics of Reduction of Wild type Na+-NQR-The reaction of Na+-NQR with excess NADH was carried out using a stopped flow spectrophotometer that allows the full UV-visible spectrum to be recorded at every time point. The time course at 450 nm, the absorbance maximum for oxidized flavins, is shown in Fig. 2. The full spectrum data for the wild type enzyme, in the absence of Na+, were best fitted as a four-step process. The spectral components for a linear reaction model (A â B â C â D â E) are shown as difference spectra in the left-hand panels of Fig. 3 (for rate constants see Table 1). It is important to note that a linear reaction model means that the kinetic intermediates are related by a linear scheme (A â B â C â D â E). This is not necessarily equivalent to the idea that the pathway for electrons through the structure of the enzyme never branches.FIGURE 3Reduction of the wild type Na+-NQR from V. cholerae by 300 Î¼m NADH; spectral components from global fit (see âExperimental Proceduresâ) together with reference spectra.

Bertsova Y.V. Ruuge E.K. Wikstrom M. Verkhovsky M.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1556: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The first component spectrum has minima at 460 and 400 nm. This was previously assigned as two-electron reduction of a flavin molecule (F â FH2) (13Bogachev A.V. Bertsova Y.V. Ruuge E.K. Wikstrom M. Verkhovsky M.I. Biochim. Biophys.

Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 3421-3428Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The second component spectrum has a minimum at 525 nm with shoulders 570 and 625 nm and a maximum at around 430 nm. This was assigned as a one-electron reduction of a neutral flavosemiquinone to the fully reduced (flavohydroquinone) state (FH. â FH2) (13Bogachev A.V. Bertsova Y.V. Ruuge E.K. Wikstrom M. Verkhovsky M.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1556: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The third component has a minimum at 460 nm, with a small trough at 395 nm and has been assigned as one-electron reduction of flavin to anionic flavosemiquinone (Fâ F.Â¯) (13Bogachev A.V. Bertsova Y.V. Ruuge E.K. Wikstrom M. Verkhovsky M.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1556: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The fourth component has a minimum at 480 nm and a maximum at 430 nm. This was originally assigned as reduction of the 2Fe-2S center in NqrF (17Bogachev A.V. Bertsova Y.V. Bloch D.A. Verkhovsky M.I. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 3421-3428Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The extinction coefficients for all one- and two-electron redox transitions of flavins (neutral and anionic) have been determined for glucose oxidase (13Bogachev A.V. Bertsova Y.V. Ruuge E.K. Wikstrom M. Verkhovsky M.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1556: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 18Massey V. Palmer G. Biochemistry. 1996; 5: 3181-3189Crossref Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Based on these values and the protein concentration, the first phase (Fig. 3) represents approximately one equivalent of flavin in the F â FH2 reaction (Îâ450 = 11.2 mm-1 cm-1 compared with 12.3 mm-1 cm-1 for glucose oxidase); the second phase (Fig. 3B) is consistent with one equivalent of flavin undergoing the FH. â FH2 reaction (Îâ570 = 4.2 mm-1 cm-1 compared with 3.9 mm-1 cm-1 for glucose oxidase); and the third phase (Fig. 3C) is consistent with two equivalents of flavin in the F â F.Â¯ reaction (Îâ450 = 18.1 mm-1 cm-1 compared with 10.8 mm-1 cm-1 for glucose oxidase). In the V. harveyi study the amplitude of the third phase was significant smaller and was assigned as the transition of one equivalent of flavin (13Bogachev A.V. Bertsova Y.V. Ruuge E.K. Wikstrom M. Verkhovsky M.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1556: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The formation of two equivalents of anionic flavosemiquinone is important in light of the fact that EPR spectra of the fully reduced enzyme show only one equivalent of anionic flavosemiquinone radical (14Barquera B. Morgan J.E. Lukoyanov D. Scholes C.P. Gennis R.B. Nilges M.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The explanation for this may be found in the fourth kinetic phase (Fig. 3D). This was originally assigned as reduction of the 2Fe-2S center (17Bogachev A.V. Bertsova Y.V. Bloch D.A. Verkhovsky M.I. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 3421-3428Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, careful comparison with published reduced-minus-oxidized spectra of iron-sulfur proteins as well as those of flavin redox transitions indicates that this component is more likely to arise from one-electron reduction of an anionic flavosemiquinone to the fully reduced state ( F.Â¯ â FH2). In Fig. 3D the spectrum of the fourth phase is shown together with reduced-minus-oxidized spectra of the 2Fe-2S center from Na+-NQR of V. cholerae obtained by expression of a fragment of the NqrF subunit (blue line) (19Tao M. Fritz G. Steuber J. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2008; 102: 1366-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) as well as the spectrum of one-electron reduction of an anionic flavosemiquinone to the fully reduced state ( F.Â¯ â FH2) obtained from glucose oxidase (18Massey V. Palmer G. Biochemistry. 1996; 5: 3181-3189Crossref Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The spectrum of the fourth kinetic phase is consistent with reduction of an anionic flavosemiquinone but clearly different from the 2Fe-2S spectrum. It thus appears that two of the flavin cofactors of the enzyme are converted to anionic flavosemiquinones in the third phase of the reaction but that one of these two is then further reduced to the fully reduced flavohydroquinone in the fourth phase, leaving only the one anionic flavosemiquinone radical observed by EPR in the fully reduced enzyme. With this assignment, the fourth phase would represent one equivalent of flavins in the F.Â¯ â FH2 reaction (Îâ475 = 5.6 mm-1 cm-1 compared with 5.9 mm-1 cm-1 for glucose oxidase (18Massey V. Palmer G. Biochemistry. 1996; 5: 3181-3189Crossref Scopus (346) Google Scholar)). This change in stoichiometry, together with the reassignment of the fourth kinetic phase, leads to considerable clarification of the participation of the four flavins in the overall redox process in the enzyme (see âDiscussionâ). Na+-NQR is a Na+ pump, and the kinetics of the enzyme has been shown to depend strongly on Na+ concentrations (13Bogachev A.V. Bertsova Y.V. Ruuge E.K. Wikstrom M. Verkhovsky M.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1556: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Therefore, the reduction of the wild type enzyme by NADH was repeated in the presence of 100 mm Na+. The right-hand panel of Fig. 2 shows the time course for this reaction. Compared with the corresponding reaction without Na+ (Fig. 2, left-hand panel), the reaction with sodium is visibly simpler. In the global fit, three kinetic phases are now resolved instead of four. The right-hand panels of Fig. 3 show the spectral components for a three-step linear reaction scheme (A â B â C â D). The third phase (Fig. 3G) can be assigned as F.Â¯ â FH2, and there is a modest increase in the rate constant (from 0.31 to 0.7 s-1). The second phase (Fig. 3F) has essentially the same spectrum as the third phase of the reaction without Na+ (Fig. 3C), which was assigned as the formation of two equivalents of anionic flavosemiquinone (see above). The rate constant of this process is significantly faster in the reaction in the presence of Na+ (increasing from 4.2 to 35. 1 s-1). The first phase (Fig. 3E) appears to be a combination of the first and second phases from the reaction without Na+ (Fig. 3, A and B), which are now resolved as single phase in the analysis. This correspondence is illustrated in Fig. 3E. The apparent rate constant for this phase is 143.2 s-1 as compared with 249.3 and 15.4 s-1 for the first and second phases without Na+, respectively. This would be consistent with a significant increase in the rate of reduction of the neutral flavosemiquinone (second phase in the absence of Na+; Fig. 3B), making this process kinetically unresolvable from the initial two-electron reduction of a flavin in the first phase without Na+ (Fig. 3A). In this case, the actual rate of the two-electron flavin reduction process could be unchanged, despite the apparent decrease in rate. Thus, the Na+ concentration exerts its effects primarily on two phases of the reaction: the reduction of the neutral flavosemiquinone and the formation of the two equivalents of anionic flavosemiquinone. However, it is likely that the Na+ dependence of these phases in the reaction all reflect a single Na+-dependent internal electron step in the enzyme mechanism (see âDiscussionâ). These results show that in the wild type enzyme electrons fill the redox acceptors in the following order: 1) F to FH2; 2) FH. to FH2; 3) 2(F to F.Â¯); and 4) F.Â¯ to FH2. However, internal electron flow in the enzyme may be governed by thermodynamics as well as kinetics, so that order does not necessarily correspond to the physical ordering of carriers in the pathway. Furthermore, visible spectroscopy does not distinguish between anionic flavosemiquinones at FMNB and FMNC. To better define the role of the specific cofactors in the process, the reaction was repeated using a series of mutant enzymes that lack specific cofactors. Fast Kinetics of Reduction of NqrB-T236Y Mutant-In this mutant the threonine 236, where a covalently bound FMN is normally attached, has been replaced by tyrosine, resulting in the loss of the FMN cofactor. In the absence of Na+ three phases are resolved in the global fit; the spectral components for a linear reaction scheme (A â B â C â D) are shown in the left-hand panels of Fig. 4. The spectrum and rate constant of the first phase are essentially the same as for the wild type enzyme, consistent with two-electron reduction of flavin. (Fig. 4A). The second phase has a spectrum consistent with formation of an anionic flavosemiquinone, together with reduction of an 2Fe-2S center. (Fig. 4B) The spectrum is similar in shape to that of the third phase from the wild type enzyme (Fig. 3C), which has been assigned to formation of anionic flavosemiquinone. However, the amplitude of this phase is consistent with participation of â¼0.3 equivalents of flavin cofactor rather than the two that apparently contribute in the wild type enzyme. Also, the contribution of a 2Fe-2S center can be detected. In the corresponding phase of the wild type enzyme, the contribution of flavins is larger, and it is not possible to determine from the spectrum whether or not there is a contribution from the 2Fe-2S center. However, it is most likely that the two-electron character of the NADH donor leads to the 2Fe-2S center becoming reduced in the same phase as reduction of the neutral flavosemiquinone, in the wild type enzyme reaction (Figs. 1 and 8).FIGURE 8Schematic model of the internal electron transfer pathway of Na+-NQR from V. cholerae.

Since NO is thought to be involved in the regulation of both sleep and circadian rhythms, we analyzed these two processes in mice deficient for cGMP-dependent protein kinase type I (PRKG1) in the brain. Prkg1 mutant mice showed a strikingly altered distribution of sleep and wakefulness over the 24 hours of a day as well as reductions in rapid-eye-movement sleep (REMS) duration and in non-REM sleep (NREMS) consolidation, and their ability to sustain waking episodes was compromised. Furthermore, they displayed a drastic decrease in electroencephalogram (EEG) power in the delta frequency range (1â4 Hz) under baseline conditions, which could be normalized after sleep deprivation. In line with the re-distribution of sleep and wakefulness, the analysis of wheel-running and drinking activity revealed more rest bouts during the activity phase and a higher percentage of daytime activity in mutant animals. No changes were observed in internal period length and phase-shifting properties of the circadian clock while chi-squared periodogram amplitude was significantly reduced, hinting at a less robust oscillator. These results indicate that PRKG1 might be involved in the stabilization and output strength of the circadian oscillator in mice. Moreover, PRKG1 deficiency results in an aberrant pattern, and consequently a reduced quality, of sleep and wakefulness, possibly due to a decreased wake-promoting output of the circadian system impinging upon sleep."
https://openalex.org/W1996665915,"The oncogene EWS-FLI1 encodes a chimeric transcription factor expressed in Ewing's sarcoma family tumors (ESFTs). EWS-FLI1 target gene expression is thought to drive ESFT pathogenesis and, therefore, inhibition of EWS-FLI1 activity holds high therapeutic promise. As the activity of many transcription factors is regulated by post-translational modifications, we studied the presence of modifications on EWS-FLI1. The immuno-purified fusion-protein was recognized by an antibody specific for O-linked Î²-N-acetylglucosaminylation, and bound readily to a phosphoprotein-specific dye. Inhibition of Ser/Thr-specific phophatases increased EWS-FLI1 molecular weight and reduced its O-GlcNAc content, suggesting that phosphorylation and O-GlcNAcylation of EWS-FLI1 interact dynamically. By mutation analysis, O-GlcNAcylation was delineated to Ser/Thr residues of the amino-terminal EWS transcriptional-activation domain. Metabolic inhibition of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway abrogated O-GlcNAcylation of EWS-FLI1 and interfered specifically with transcriptional activation of the EWS-FLI1 target Id2. These results suggest that drugs modulating glycosylation of EWS-FLI1 interfere functionally with its activity and might, therefore, constitute promising additions to the current ESFT chemotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W1973389245,"Human liver peroxisomal alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGT) is a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme that converts glyoxylate into glycine. AGT deficiency causes primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1), a rare autosomal recessive disorder, due to a marked increase in hepatic oxalate production. Normal human AGT exists as two polymorphic variants: the major (AGT-Ma) and the minor (AGT-Mi) allele. AGT-Mi causes the PH1 disease only when combined with some mutations. In this study, the molecular basis of the synergism between AGT-Mi and F152I mutation has been investigated through a detailed biochemical characterization of AGT-Mi and the Phe(152) variants combined either with the major (F152I-Ma, F152A-Ma) or the minor allele (F152I-Mi). Although these species show spectral features, kinetic parameters, and PLP binding affinity similar to those of AGT-Ma, the Phe(152) variants exhibit the following differences with respect to AGT-Ma and AGT-Mi: (i) pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate (PMP) is released during the overall transamination leading to the conversion into apoenzymes, and (ii) the PMP binding affinity is at least 200-1400-fold lower. Thus, Phe(152) is not an essential residue for transaminase activity, but plays a role in selectively stabilizing the AGT-PMP complex, by a proper orientation of Trp(108), as suggested by bioinformatic analysis. These data, together with the finding that apoF152I-Mi is the only species that at physiological temperature undergoes a time-dependent inactivation and concomitant aggregation, shed light on the molecular defects resulting from the association of the F152I mutation with AGT-Mi, and allow to speculate on the responsiveness to pyridoxine therapy of PH1 patients carrying this mutation."

In contrast, Syk has a positive function in murine mammary tumor virus-mediated tumorigenesis. A yeast two-hybrid screen using a library from human mammary gland identified tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor-interacting protein (TRIP) as an Syk-binding partner. This interaction is mediated by the C-terminal region of TRIP and is enhanced by the treatment of cells with TNF and the tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk. Syk and TRIP have opposing functions in TNF-signaling pathways. Syk enhances the activation of nuclear factor-ÎºB by TNF and this is antagonized by TRIP. The overexpression of TRIP sensitizes cells to TNF-induced apoptosis, an effect that can be reversed by the coexpression of Syk."

Deregulated activation of this pathway is a common event in diverse human diseases such as cancers, cardiac hypertrophy, vascular restenosis and nephrotic hypertrophy. Although mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin, has been widely used to inhibit the aberrant signaling due to mTOR activation that plays a major role in hyperproliferative diseases, in some cases rapamycin does not attenuate the cell proliferation and survival. Thus, we studied the mechanism(s) by which cells may confer resistance to rapamycin. Our data show that in a variety of cell types the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin activates extracellularly regulated kinases (Erk1/2) signaling. Rapamycin-mediated activation of the Erk1/2 signaling requires (a) the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), (b) its tyrosine kinase activity and (c) intact autophosphorylation sites on the receptor. Rapamycin treatment increases tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR without the addition of growth factor and this transactivation of receptor involves activation of c-Src. We also show that rapamycin treatment triggers activation of cell survival signaling pathway by activating the prosurvival kinases Erk1/2 and p90RSK. These studies provide a novel paradigm by which cells escape the apoptotic actions of rapamycin and its derivatives that inhibit the mTOR pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2055076246,"Mutations of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene RB are frequently observed in human cancers, but rarely in non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs). Emerging evidence also suggests that the RB-related gene p130 is inactivated in a subset of human NSCLCs. To directly test the specific tumor suppressor roles of RB and p130 in NSCLC, we crossed Rb and p130 conditional mutant mice to mice carrying a conditional oncogenic K-Ras allele. In this model, controlled oncogenic K-Ras activation leads to the development of adenocarcinoma, a major subtype of NSCLC. We found that loss of p130 accelerated the death of mice, providing direct evidence in vivo that p130 is a tumor suppressor gene, albeit a weak one in this context. Loss of Rb increased the efficiency of lung cancer initiation and resulted in the development of high-grade adenocarcinomas and rapid death. Thus, despite the low frequency of RB mutations in human NSCLCs and reports that K-Ras activation and loss of RB function are rarely found in the same human tumors, loss of Rb clearly cooperates with activation of oncogenic K-Ras in lung adenocarcinoma development in mice."
https://openalex.org/W1984605180,"Pulmonary surfactant protein A (SP-A), a member of the collectin family, plays an important role in innate immune defense of the lung. In this study, we examined the role of SP-A in modulating complement receptor-mediated phagocytosis. Complement receptors (CR), CR3 (CD11b), and CR4 (CD11c) were expressed at reduced levels on the surface of alveolar macrophages from Sp-a(-/-) compared with Sp-a(+/+) mice. Administration of intratracheal SP-A to Sp-a(-/-) mice induced the translocation of CR3 from alveolar macrophage intracellular pools to the cell surface. Intratracheal challenge with Haemophilus influenza enhanced CR3 expression on the surface of alveolar macrophages from Sp-a(-/-) and Sp-a(+/+) mice, but relative expression remained lower in the Sp-a(-/-) mice at all time points post-inoculation. The effects of SP-A on macrophage and neutrophil CR3 redistribution between intracellular and cell surface pools were restricted to cells isolated from the lung. SP-A augmented CR3-mediated phagocytosis in a manner that was attenuated by N-glycanase or collagenase treatment of SP-A, implicating the N-linked sugar and collagen-like domains in that function. The binding of CR3 to SP-A was calcium dependent and mediated by the I-domain of CR3 and to a lesser extent by the CR3 lectin domain. Mapping of the domains of SP-A that were required for optimal binding to CR3 revealed that the N-linked sugars were more critical than the collagen-like domain or the extent of oligomeric assembly. We conclude that SP-A modulates the cell surface expression of CR3 on alveolar macrophages, binds to CR3, and enhances CR3-mediated phagocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W2032801276,"The Bateman domain (CBS subdomain) of IMP dehydrogenase (IMPDH), a rate-limiting enzyme of the de novo GMP biosynthesis, is evolutionarily conserved but has no established function. Deletion of the Bateman domain has no effect on the in vitro IMPDH activity. We report that in vivo deletion of the Bateman domain of IMPDH in Escherichia coli (guaB(DeltaCBS)) sensitizes the bacterium to growth arrest by adenosine and inosine. These nucleosides exert their growth inhibitory effect via a dramatic increase in the intracellular adenylate nucleotide pool, which results in the enhanced allosteric inhibition of PRPP synthetase and consequently a PRPP deficit. The ensuing starvation for pyrimidine nucleotides culminates in growth arrest. Thus, deletion of the Bateman domain of IMPDH derepresses the synthesis of AMP from IMP. The growth inhibitory effect of inosine can be rescued by second-site suppressor mutations in the genes responsible for the conversion of inosine to AMP (gsk, purA, and purB) as well as by the prsA1 allele, which encodes a PRPP synthetase that is insensitive to allosteric inhibition by adenylate nucleotides. Importantly, the guaB(DeltaCBS) phenotype can be complemented in trans by a mutant guaB allele, which encodes a catalytically disabled IMPDH(C305A) protein containing an intact Bateman domain. We conclude that the Bateman domain of IMPDH is a negative trans-regulator of adenylate nucleotide synthesis, and that this role is independent of the catalytic function of IMPDH in the de novo GMP biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2063220794,"Cell cycle progression is monitored constantly to ensure faithful passage of genetic codes and genome stability. We have demonstrated previously that, upon DNA damage, TTK/hMps1 activates the checkpoint kinase CHK2 by phosphorylating CHK2 at Thr68. However, it remains to be determined whether and how TTK/hMps1 responds to DNA damage. In this report, we present evidence that TTK/hMps1 can be induced by DNA damage in normal human fibroblasts. Interestingly, the induction depends on CHK2 because CHK2-targeting small interfering RNA or a CHK2 inhibitor abolishes the increase. Such induction is mediated through phosphorylation of TTK/hMps1 at Thr288 by CHK2 and requires the CHK2 SQ/TQ cluster domain/forkhead-associated domain. In cells, TTK/hMps1 phosphorylation at Thr288 is induced by DNA damage and forms nuclear foci, which colocalize partially with Î³-H2AX. Reexpression of TTK/hMps1 T288A mutant in TTK/hMps1-knockdown cells causes a defect in G2/M arrest, suggesting that phosphorylation at this site participates in the proper checkpoint execution. Our study uncovered a regulatory loop between TTK/hMps1 and CHK2 whereby DNA damage-activated CHK2 may facilitate the stabilization of TTK/hMps1, therefore maintaining the checkpoint control."
https://openalex.org/W2059541803,"KCNQ1 voltage-gated K+ channels (Kv7.1) associate with the family of five KCNE peptides to form complexes with diverse gating properties and pharmacological sensitivities. The varied gating properties of the different KCNQ1-KCNE complexes enables the same K+ channel to function in both excitable and non excitable tissues. Small molecule activators would be valuable tools for dissecting the gating mechanisms of KCNQ1-KCNE complexes; however, there are very few known activators of KCNQ1 channels and most are ineffective on the physiologically relevant KCNQ1-KCNE complexes. Here we show that a simple boronic acid, phenylboronic acid (PBA), activates KCNQ1/KCNE1 complexes co-expressed in Xenopus oocytes at millimolar concentrations. PBA shifts the voltage sensitivity of KCNQ1 channel complexes to favor the open state at negative potentials. Analysis of different-sized charge carriers revealed that PBA also targets the permeation pathway of KCNQ1 channels. Activation by the boronic acid moiety has some specificity for the Kv7 family members (KCNQ1, KCNQ2/3, and KCNQ4) since PBA does not activate Shaker or hERG channels. Furthermore, the commercial availability of numerous PBA derivatives provides a large class of compounds to investigate the gating mechanisms of KCNQ1-KCNE complexes."
https://openalex.org/W1982476634,"The role of RNA-binding proteins in cancer biology is recognized increasingly. The nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and AU-rich RNA-binding protein HuR stabilizes several cancer-related target mRNAs. The proto-oncogene c-fms, whose 3'untranslated region (3'UTR) is not AU-rich, is associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer. Using a large breast-cancer tissue array (N=670), we found nuclear HuR expression to be associated with nodal metastasis and independently with poor survival (P=0.03, RR 1.45), as well as to be co-expressed with c-fms in the breast tumors (P=0.0007). We described c-fms mRNA as a direct target of HuR in vivo, and that HuR bound specifically to a 69-nt region containing 'CUU' motifs in 3'UTR c-fms RNA. Overexpressing or silencing HuR significantly up- or down-regulated c-fms RNA expression, respectively. We also found that known glucocorticoid stimulation of c-fms RNA and protein is largely dependent on the presence of HuR. HuR, by binding to the 69-nt wild type, but not mutant, c-fms sequence can regulate reporter gene expression post-transcriptionally. We are the first to describe that HuR can regulate gene expression by binding non-AU-rich sequences in 3'UTR c-fms RNA. Collectively, our findings suggest that HuR plays a supportive role for c-fms in breast cancer progression by binding a 69-nt element in its 3'UTR, thus regulating its expression."

Here we investigated the effects of Exo70 on tethering and fusion of GLUT4 vesicles in primary isolated rat adipose cells. We found that Exo70 wild type was sequestered away from the plasma membrane in non-stimulated cells, and its overexpression had no effect on GLUT4 trafficking.

Conjugated antibodies Rhodamine Red-X and Texas Red were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc. (West Grove, PA). 125I-sheep anti-mouse antibody was from Dupont. Myc-Exo70 and Myc-Exo70-N were kindly provided by Dr. A. R. Saltiel. Caveolin-GFP and tubulin-GFP were kindly provided by Dr. J. Lippincott-Schwartz. Construction of the HA-tagged GLUT4 has been described previously (26Quon M.J. Guerre-Millo M. Zarnowski M.J. Butte A.J. Em M. Cushman S.W. Taylor S.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5587-5591Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To generate HA-GLUT4-mCherry, the mCherry was amplified from pRSET-B mCherry (gift from S. M. Simon) using the primers 5â²-AGGTACCATGGTGAGCAAGG-3â² and 5â²-AGCGGCCGCTTACTTGTAC-3â². The PCR product was cut with Kpn1 and Not1 and ligated into digested HA-GLUT4-GFP pQB125 to generate HA-GLUT4-mCherry pQB125. The sequence of HA-GLUT4-mCherry was verified by sequencing (MTR Scientific, Ijamsville, MD). Cell Culture, Transfections, and Cell Surface Antibody Binding Assay-Preparation of isolated rat adipose cells from male rats (CD strain, Charles River Laboratories, MD), electroporation of rat adipose cells, and the cell surface antibody binding assay were performed as described (11Lizunov V.A. Matsumoto H. Zimmerberg J. Cushman S.W. Frolov V.A. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 27Al-Hasani H. Hinck C.S. Cushman S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17504-17510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Briefly, isolated adipose cells were electroporated (3 Ã 12 ms, 500 V/cm) with expression plasmids as indicated and cultured for 24 h at 37 Â°C in 5% CO2. HA-GLUT4-GFP plasmid was used at a final concentration of 8 Î¼g/ml; Myc-Exo70 and Myc-Exo70-N were also used at 8â16 Î¼g/ml. After stimulation with 70 nm insulin for 30 min at 37 Â°C, subcellular trafficking of HA-tagged GLUT4 was stopped by the addition of 2 mm KCN, and the amount of the HA epitope on the cell surface was determined by an antibody binding assay using a monoclonal anti-HA antibody and a I125-labeled sheep anti-mouse secondary antibody as described (27Al-Hasani H. Hinck C.S. Cushman S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17504-17510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Unless stated otherwise, the values obtained for empty vector-transfected cells were subtracted from all other values to correct for nonspecific antibody binding. Immunostaining of Cells and Confocal Microscopy-Immunostaining of cells was performed as described elsewhere (3Malide D. Dwyer N.K. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Cushman S.W. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1997; 45: 1083-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 11Lizunov V.A. Matsumoto H. Zimmerberg J. Cushman S.W. Frolov V.A. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min at room temperature and then incubated for 2 h with primary antibodies followed by incubation with conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Immunostaining of cell surface HA was carried out under non-permeabilized conditions, whereas labeling of intracellular Exo70 was carried out in cells permeabilized by 0.1% saponin (Sigma). Secondary antibodies (Rhodamine Red-X and Texas Red) were imaged on an LSM510 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc., NY) using planapochromat Ã60 and Ã100 1.4 NA oil objectives. A multitrack protocol with sequential excitation at 488- and 543-nm wavelengths was utilized to minimize cross-talk between the GFP and Rhodamine Red-X/Texas Red channels. For each experimental condition, 5â10 images/cell were recorded from 10â15 cells. For three-dimensional reconstruction, series of optical sections were collected at 0.5-Î¼m intervals, with the pinhole set at one Airy disc. TIRF Microscopy of Live Isolated Rat Adipose Cells-An objective-based total internal reflection microscopy setup built around an Olympus IX70 microscope was described previously (11Lizunov V.A. Matsumoto H. Zimmerberg J. Cushman S.W. Frolov V.A. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Transfected adipose cells that were incubated overnight were placed into Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate/Hepes buffer containing 5% bovine serum albumin and 5% Ficoll (Sigma) and added to Delta-T dishes (Bioptech, Butler, PA) kept at 37 Â°C. Where specified, cells were stimulated with 100 nm insulin. Cells floating in suspension were sandwiched between a dish coverslip and a second coverslip on top (22-mm round, No. 1., Erie Scientific, Portsmouth, NH). Series of 100â300 time lapse images for each cell were acquired at rates of 2â5 frames/s and streamed into Metamorph via a video A/D card (FlashBus). Image Analysis-Stacks of time-lapse images were processed with ImageJ 1.37 (National Institutes of Health). Circular regions of 3-pixel radius were used to identify single GLUT4 vesicles according to the following criteria. (i) Mean pixel intensity was 20% higher than the background fluorescence, (ii) the pixel intensity profile had a local maximum, and (iii) the full width half-maximum of a Gaussian fit was less than 4 pixels. Vesicle traffic analysis was carried out as follows. Projection images with a maximum and mean intensity for each pixel were made for each stack representing 1 min of recording. The mean projection image was then subtracted pixel by pixel from the maximum projection to correct for non-uniform background and to exclude stationary objects. The resulting image contained the trajectories of mobile vesicles. Traces longer than 2 Î¼m were identified visually, and the number of traces was counted for 2â3 regions (10 Ã 10 Î¼m) for each cell. All data are represented as means Â± S.D. unless stated otherwise. Expression and Subcellular Localization of GLUT4 and Exo70-To study the effect of Exo70 on GLUT4 exocytosis, we co-transfected isolated rat adipose cells with either Myc-tagged Exo70 wild type or Myc-tagged Exo70-N mutant (amino acids 1â384) and HA-GLUT4-GFP constructs. Confocal microscopy was used to assess the level of co-expression and visualize subcellular localization of both proteins. The percentage of cells expressing Myc-Exo70 (â¼30%) was slightly larger than that of cells expressing HA-GLUT4-GFP (â¼20%). However, more than 90% of the cells expressing HA-GLUT4-GFP also co-expressed Myc-Exo70, as was shown by anti-Myc antibody labeling (83 out of 92 cells in three independent experiments). No significant difference in co-expression was observed between wild-type and mutant Exo70. Examination of confocal sections of the entire adipose cell showed that GLUT4 and Exo70 were localized to distinct structures that were scattered throughout the thin layer of cytoplasm between the plasma membrane and lipid droplet (Fig. 1A). Further, we examined the subcellular localization of GLUT4 and wild-type/mutant Exo70 in the vicinity of the plasma membrane. In non-stimulated cells, both GLUT4 and Exo70 had low plasma membrane staining, but substantial numbers of GLUT4 and Exo70 structures were close to the plasma membrane (within 0.5 Î¼m) (Fig. 1B). Because we did not observe any colocalization between GLUT4 and Exo70 puncta, we suggest that the majority of Exo70 is associated with vesicular compartments distinct from GLUT4 vesicles. Although GLUT4 is known to localize in GSV in the basal state and redistribute to the plasma membrane upon insulin stimulation, Exo70 is considered to be a cytosolic protein that has not been reported to associate with intracellular vesicles. Thus, we expected it to have a diffuse rather than punctate staining. To confirm the punctate distribution of Exo70, we also used an antibody directed to Exo70 that showed the same pattern (data not shown). Insulin stimulation induced a significant redistribution of GLUT4 and both wild-type and mutant Exo70 to the plasma membrane (Fig. 1C). This led to an effective increase in the overlap of GLUT4 and Exo70. However, the GSV and Exo70 puncta still did not co-localize. Although the diffuse GLUT4 staining represents GLUT4 inserted into the plasma membrane, the diffuse Exo70 staining is probably due to increased association with the plasma membrane leaflet. (Fig. 1D). This conforms to similar findings in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. As a part of the Exocyst complex, Exo70 is expected to only transiently interact with GLUT4 vesicles at the plasma membrane to mediate their tethering. Thus, low association of GLUT4 with Exo70 in the absence of insulin correlates with the low rate of GSV tethering and fusion reported previously for non-stimulated cells. Moreover, the increased overlap of Exo70 and GLUT4 upon insulin stimulation further supports the involvement of Exo70 in the tethering of GSV. However, in contrast to published 3T3-L1 cell data (19Inoue M. Chang L. Hwang J. Chiang S.H. Saltiel A.R. Nature. 2003; 422: 629-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 25Ewart M.A. Clarke M. Kane S. Chamberlain L.H. Gould G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3812-3816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), we could not detect a significant difference in redistribution between wild-type and mutant Exo70 in response to insulin. Effect of Exo70 on GLUT4 Vesicle Tethering-To test how Exo70 affects tethering of GLUT4 vesicles, we quantified trafficking of GSV in the vicinity of the plasma membrane of isolated adipose cells using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. Consistent with previous reports, GSV traffic was supported by the microtubule network, and all detected long range movement of GSV was along microtubules (Fig. 2A). The traffic intensity was measured as the number of trafficking GSV per defined area of 10 Ã 10 Î¼m/min. Under non-stimulated conditions, cells expressing wild-type Exo70 exhibited intensive GLUT4 vesicle trafficking, similar to control cells expressing only GLUT4-GFP. Projections of traces (Fig. 2B) illustrate the traffic intensity as traces/100 Î¼m2/min. However, although cells expressing wild-type Exo70 showed traffic intensity similar to control cells (GLUT4-GFP only), cells expressing Exo70-N mutant exhibited a significantly reduced GSV traffic (Fig. 2, B and C). This suggests that the Exo70-N mutant might induce GSV tethering, mimicking the effect of insulin. Consistent with previous findings, insulin stimulation decreased GSV traffic in control cells and cells expressing wild-type Exo70 by increasing the frequency of vesicle tethering to the plasma membrane (Fig. 2C). However, insulin did not induce any further decrease of GSV trafficking in cells expressing Exo70 mutant (Fig. 2C). This suggests that the effect of insulin on tethering of GSV can be mediated through interactions dependent on the truncated part of Exo70. The decreased GSV trafficking intensity in the Exo70 mutant cells was not due to adverse effects on the microtubules, as we found the microtubule network intact (Fig. 1A), with the density and length of microtubules similar to control cells (supplemental material). Although the expression of Exo70 mutant diminished the path length of mobile GLUT4 vesicles (Fig. 2D), the speed was unaffected (â¼1.7 Â± 0.5 Î¼m/s, calculated for long tracks >5 Î¼m). Also, to address the specificity of the Exo70 mutant effect on GSV traffic, we co-expressed it with caveolin-GFP and found no effect on the traffic of caveolin-labeled vesicles (supplemental material). Altogether, these data indicate that the effect of the Exo70 mutant is not related to the molecular motors involved in microtubule-based traffic but rather to the probability of GSV tethering. In contrast to insulin-induced tethering of GSV, which was followed shortly by fusion events, the Exo70 mutant-induced GSV tethering did not lead to fusion in the absence of insulin (Fig. 3A). The addition of insulin was required to induce fusion of pretethered GSV in Exo70 mutant-expressing cells (Fig. 3B). This further supports the notion that insulin is necessary for stimulating the fusion step of GSV exocytosis. Effect of Exo70 on GLUT4 Vesicle Fusion-To test how Exo70 affects fusion of GSV, we utilized an HA-GLUT4-GFP construct. This allows detection of GLUT4 inserted into the plasma membrane exposing the HA epitope to the exterior by the binding of an HA antibody in non-permeabilized cells (27Al-Hasani H. Hinck C.S. Cushman S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17504-17510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The amount of GLUT4 in the plasma membrane was assessed in isolated rat adipose cells co-expressing HA-GLUT4-GFP and either wild-type Myc-Exo70 or mutant Myc-Exo70. The level of HA exposure was measured in bulk using a radioactive secondary antibody. In control experiments, co-localization of HA labeling with GFP fluorescence was assessed (Fig. 4, A and B) to visualize both the exposed and the intracellular GLUT4. In non-stimulated cells, the amount of GLUT4 inserted into the plasma membrane was low (<30% when compared with insulin), and most of the HA antibody labeling was localized to puncta (Fig. 4, A and B, upper panels). These puncta can represent the rare kiss-and-run fusion events of GSV (12Bai L. Wang Y. Fan J. Chen Y. Ji W. Qu A. Xu P. James D.E. Xu T. Cell Metab. 2007; 5: 47-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) or sites of GLUT4 clustering at endocytic pits (13Huang S. Lifshitz L.M. Jones C. Bellve K.D. Standley C. Fonseca S. Corvera S. Fogarty K.E. Czech M.P. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 27: 3456-3469Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). After insulin stimulation, both Exo70 WT and Exo70 mutant cells exhibited a similar 2â3-fold increase in HA-antibody binding (Fig. 4C, solid bars) and showed diffuse staining of the plasma membrane that colocalized with the GLUT4-GFP signal (Fig. 4, A and B, lower panels). We could not detect any difference in distribution or insertion of GLUT4 between control cells and cells expressing either Exo70 wild type or Exo70 mutant. Thus, we conclude that the overall rate of GLUT4 exocytosis is not affected by expression of wild-type or mutant Exo70. The absence of correlation between GLUT4 insertion and increased GSV tethering suggests that tethering is not the rate-limiting step. Different Effects of Exo70 in 3T3-L1 Cells and Primary Adipose Cells-Insulin regulates GLUT4 exocytosis at multiple steps involving trafficking, tethering, and fusion. The molecular events associated with stimulated GLUT4 exocytosis are likely to take place at both the vesicular surface and the plasma membrane. In the current study, we investigated the role of the Exocyst component Exo70 on the trafficking and tethering events of GSVs. We did not see any effect of overexpressing the wild-type Exo70 protein. Surprisingly, the Exo70-N mutant, reported to block the assembly of the Exocyst complex and GLUT4 exocytosis in differentiated 3T3-L1 cells, enhances the tethering in the primary adipose cells but does not affect the rate of fusion, neither in the basal nor in the insulin-stimulated state. The effect of the Exo70 mutant on the tethering in basal conditions was strikingly similar to insulin-induced tethering but is insufficient to induce fusion. This fact indicates that insulin regulates fusion steps of GLUT4 exocytosis independently of upstream tethering where Exo70 might be involved. The mechanism of Exo70 targeting to the sites of exocytosis at the plasma membrane remains controversial. Recent data from budding yeast studies suggest that the C-terminal domain of Exo70 protein is important for specific binding to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate lipids (24He B. Xi F. Zhang X. Zhang J. Guo W. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 4053-4065Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Because insulin is known to stimulate generation of phosphatidylinositols, it can serve as means of Exo70 recruitment to the plasma membrane (18Jiang Z.Y. Chawla A. Bose A. Way M. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 509-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the N-terminal domain of Exo70 (1â99 amino acids) binds TC10 and Snapin (23Bao Y. Lopez J.A. James D.E. Hunziker W. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 324-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and thus can associate with SNARE machinery through protein interaction without relying on lipid binding. In non-stimulated 3T3-L1 cells, Exo70 is located in the perinuclear regions (18Jiang Z.Y. Chawla A. Bose A. Way M. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 509-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 19Inoue M. Chang L. Hwang J. Chiang S.H. Saltiel A.R. Nature. 2003; 422: 629-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). In response to insulin, the Exo70 wild type translocates to the plasma membrane, whereas the Exo70-N mutant stays in the perinuclear region (19Inoue M. Chang L. Hwang J. Chiang S.H. Saltiel A.R. Nature. 2003; 422: 629-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). This was thought to disrupt assembly of the Exocyst complex at the plasma membrane and ablate the GLUT4 exocytosis. In the mature primary adipose cells, we found that both wild-type and mutant Exo70 were localized in the TIRF zone within 200 nm of the plasma membrane and not in the perinuclear region as in the basal 3T3L-1 differentiated adipocytes. Thus, there is no need for long ranged translocation/movement of Exo70 necessary for GLUT4 exocytosis in mature adipose cells. In fact, this discrepancy in distribution is not specific to Exo70 but rather is a general difference in cellular architecture between newly differentiated 3T3-L1 adipose cells and mature primary adipose cells (3Malide D. Dwyer N.K. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Cushman S.W. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1997; 45: 1083-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 27Al-Hasani H. Hinck C.S. Cushman S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17504-17510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). For example, in primary adipocytes, 90% of the GLUT4 resides in GSV close to the plasma membrane surface and does not require translocation from the perinuclear areas in response to insulin (11Lizunov V.A. Matsumoto H. Zimmerberg J. Cushman S.W. Frolov V.A. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The central lipid droplet in primary adipose cells occupies 99% of the cell volume and thereby pushes all the intracellular compartments to the periphery in close apposition to the plasma membrane. Even the Golgi structures are found to be dispersed far away from the nucleus. This unique architecture of mature adipose cells may promote a shift to local autonomous recycling of GLUT4 to minimize its dependence on recycling compartments located in perinuclear area. So far, most studies addressing the molecular mechanisms of insulin-regulated GLUT4 exocytosis have been done using cultured adipose cells, 3T3-L1 cells, and isolated primary cells, models that both have disadvantages. Although the differentiated 3T3-L1 cells never develop into fully mature adipose cells and are maintained in culture only for a relatively short period after differentiation, mature adipose cells can be cultured only for a few days after isolation, which limits the application of techniques such as small interfering RNA. New strategies involving stromal cells derived from adipose tissue have shown a potential to develop into mature adipose cells that could be kept in culture without losing the adipose phenotype (28Vermette M. Trottier V. Menard V. Saint-Pierre L. Roy A. Fradette J. Biomaterials. 2007; 28: 2850-2860Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). This promises to be an invaluable tool for answering the question how differentiation and maturation of adipocytes affects molecular machinery involved in GLUT4 exocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W2073210733,"Imaging of low abundance proteins in time and space by fluorescence microscopy is typically hampered by host-cell autofluorescence. Streptomycetes are an important model system for the study of bacterial development, and undergo multiple synchronous cell division during the sporulation stage. To analyse this phenomenon in detail, fluorescence microscopy, and in particular also the recently published novel live imaging techniques, require optimal signal to noise ratios. Here we describe the development of a novel derivative of Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) with strongly reduced autofluorescence, allowing the imaging of fluorescently labelled proteins at significantly higher resolution. The enhanced image detail provided novel localization information for the cell division protein FtsZ, demonstrating a new developmental stage where multiple FtsZ foci accumulate at the septal plane. This suggests that multiple foci are sequentially produced, ultimately connecting to form the complete Z ring. The enhanced imaging properties are an important step forward for the confocal and live imaging of less abundant proteins and for the use of lower intensity fluorophores in streptomycetes."
https://openalex.org/W2002121599,"Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular protozoan parasite that infects nearly one-third of the human population. The success of T. gondii is based on its complex life cycle; a lytic tachyzoite form disseminates infection, whereas an encysted bradyzoite form establishes a latent, chronic infection. Persistence and transmissibility is central to the survival of the parasite and is, in part, mediated by a family of antigenically distinct surface antigen glycoprotein (SAG)-related sequences (SRS) adhesins that play a dual role in host cell attachment and host immune evasion. More than 160 members of the SRS family have been identified with only the tachyzoite-expressed SAG1 structurally characterized. Here we report the first structural description of the bradyzoite adhesin BSR4 using x-ray crystallography and small angle x-ray scattering. The 1.90-A crystal structure of BSR4 reveals an architecture comprised of tandem beta sandwich domains organized in a head to tail fashion with the N-terminal domain responsible for dimer formation. A restructured topology in BSR4 results in a ligand-binding site that is significantly reorganized in both structure and chemistry relative to SAG1, consistent with BSR4 binding a distinct physiological ligand. The small angle x-ray scattering solution structure of BSR4 highlights a potentially important structural role for the interdomain polymorphic linker that imparts significant flexibility that may promote structural adaptation during ligand binding. This study reveals an unexpected level of structural diversity within the SRS superfamily and provides important insight into the role of these virulence factors."
https://openalex.org/W2074820523,"Defects of metabolic enzymes result in a variety of manifestations not logically explained by the primary metabolic function. Dominant defects of fumarate hydratase (FH) result in predisposition to cutaneous and uterine leiomyomas, and renal cell cancer. FH is a metabolic enzyme of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and its tumor-suppressor mechanism is not fully understood. We compared the consequences of FH deficiency and respiratory chain (RC) deficiency using global expression pattern of diploid primary fibroblasts. This approach utilized the information that RC defects do not seem to predispose to tumorigenesis, and the aim was to identify FH-specific signaling effects that might have relevance to tumor formation. These results were then compared to global expression patterns of FH-deficient and sporadic uterine leiomyoma data sets. We show here that FH-deficient fibroblasts share a common transcriptional fingerprint with FH-deficient and sporadic leiomyomas, highlighting the downregulation of serum response factor (SRF)-regulated transcripts, particularly the FOSâJUNB pathway. We confirmed the downregulation of this pathway at transcriptional and protein level. SRF has a fundamental function in the differentiation of smooth muscle progenitor cells, and its downregulation both in diploid FH-deficient primary fibroblasts and in leiomyomas suggests an early function in the mechanism of uterine leiomyoma formation in FH deficiency. Concordantly, the phosphorylated form of SRF, known to activate transcription, is undetectable in leiomyomas whereas clearly detected in several nuclei in the differentiated myometrium. A similar transcriptional SRF-pathway fingerprint in FH-deficient and sporadic leiomyomas emphasizes the potential importance of this pathway in primary events leading to leiomyomatosis."

https://openalex.org/W2022330237,"The tremendous diversity in vertebrate skull formation illustrates the range of forms and functions generated by varying genetic programs. Understanding the molecular basis for this variety may provide us with insights into mechanisms underlying human craniofacial anomalies. In this study, we provide evidence that the anuran Xenopus laevis can be developed as a simplified model system for the study of cranial ossification and suture patterning. The head structures of Xenopus undergo dramatic remodelling during metamorphosis; as a result, tadpole morphology differs greatly from the adult bony skull. Because of the extended larval period in Xenopus, the molecular basis of these alterations has not been well studied.We examined late larval, metamorphosing, and post-metamorphosis froglet stages in intact and sectioned animals. Using micro-computed tomography (microCT) and tissue staining of the frontoparietal bone and surrounding cartilage, we observed that bone formation initiates from lateral ossification centers, proceeding from posterior-to-anterior. Histological analyses revealed midline abutting and posterior overlapping sutures. To determine the mechanisms underlying the large-scale cranial changes, we examined proliferation, apoptosis, and proteinase activity during remodelling of the skull roof. We found that tissue turnover during metamorphosis could be accounted for by abundant matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity, at least in part by MMP-1 and -13.A better understanding of the dramatic transformation from cartilaginous head structures to bony skull during Xenopus metamorphosis may provide insights into tissue remodelling and regeneration in other systems. Our studies provide some new molecular insights into this process."
https://openalex.org/W2140308009,"The serine/threonine protein kinase, Akt/PKB, has an essential function in cell survival during response to various stresses. Recent studies have demonstrated that Akt isoforms exhibit some distinct physiological functions, but the isotype-specific functions for Akt in the stress response have not been fully identified. In this study, we analysed the cellular response to genotoxic stress using isogenic wild-type, Akt1(-/-) and Akt2(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Marked hypersensitivity of Akt2(-/-) MEFs was observed to UV irradiation, whereas wild-type and Akt1(-/-) MEFs showed comparable levels of resistance. Akt2(-/-) mouse aortic endothelial cells also showed hypersensitivity to UV and the reconstitution of Akt2 expression in the Akt2(-/-) MEFs restored the UV resistance of the cells. Interestingly, upon UV irradiation, JNK and p38 were significantly upregulated in Akt2(-/-) MEFs, compared to wild-type and Akt1(-/-) MEFs. Additionally, inhibition of JNK and p38 activation reduced UV-induced cell death. Furthermore, both the hyperactivation of JNK and p38 and the UV-induced cell death in Akt2(-/-) MEFs were completely inhibited by restoring Akt2 expression. These results indicate that Akt2, but not Akt1, is essential for cell survival upon UV irradiation, and that Akt2 prevents UV-induced cell death by inhibiting activation of JNK and p38."
https://openalex.org/W1988996918,"Circulating lipoproteins improve the outcome of severe Gram-negative infections through neutralizing lipopolysaccharides (LPS), thus inhibiting the release of proinflammatory cytokines.Low density lipoprotein receptor deficient (LDLR-/-) mice, with a 7-fold increase in LDL, are resistant against infection with Salmonella typhimurium (survival 100% vs 5%, p<0.001), and 100 to 1000-fold lower bacterial burden in the organs, compared with LDLR+/+ mice. Protection was not due to differences in cytokine production, phagocytosis, and killing of Salmonella organisms. The differences were caused by the excess of lipoproteins, as hyperlipoproteinemic ApoE-/- mice were also highly resistant to Salmonella infection. Lipoproteins protect against infection by interfering with the binding of Salmonella to host cells, and preventing organ invasion. This leads to an altered biodistribution of the microorganisms during the first hours of infection: after intravenous injection of Salmonella into LDLR+/+ mice, the bacteria invaded the liver and spleen within 30 minutes of infection. In contrast, in LDLR-/- mice, Salmonella remained constrained to the circulation from where they were efficiently cleared, with decreased organ invasion.plasma lipoproteins are a potent host defense mechanism against invasive Salmonella infection, by blocking adhesion of Salmonella to the host cells and subsequent tissue invasion."
https://openalex.org/W2001850705,"Background The eggs in most invertebrates are fertilized externally, and therefore their resulting embryos are exposed to an environment full of microbes, many of which are pathogens capable of killing other organisms. How the developing embryos of invertebrates defend themselves against pathogenic attacks is an intriguing question to biologists, and remains largely unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we clearly demonstrated that the egg cytosol prepared from the newly fertilized eggs of amphioxus Branchiostoma belcheri, an invertebrate chordate, was able to inhibit the growth of both the Gram-negative bacterium Vibrio anguillarum and the Gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus. All findings point to that it is the complement system operating via the alternative pathway that is attributable to the bacteriostatic activity. Conclusions/Significance This appears to be the first report providing the evidence for the functional role of the maternal complement components in the eggs of invertebrate species, paving the way for the study of maternal immunity in other invertebrate organisms whose eggs are fertilized in vitro. It also supports the notion that the early developing embryos share some defense mechanisms common with the adult species."
https://openalex.org/W2055890027,"Transforming growth factor-Î²1 (TGFÎ²1) plays a role in neoplastic transformation and transdifferentiation. GÎ±12 and GÎ±13, referred to as the gep oncogenes, stimulate mitogenic pathways. Nonetheless, no information is available regarding their roles in the regulation of the TGFÎ²1 gene and the molecules linking them to gene transcription. Knockdown or knockout experiments using murine embryonic fibroblasts and hepatic stellate cells indicated that a GÎ±12 and GÎ±13 deficiency reduced constitutive, auto-stimulatory or thrombin-inducible TGFÎ²1 gene expression. In contrast, transfection of activated mutants of GÎ±12 and GÎ±13 enabled the knockout cells to promote TGFÎ²1 induction. A promoter deletion analysis suggested that activating protein 1 (AP-1) plays a role in TGFÎ²1 gene transactivation, which was corroborated by the observation that a deficiency of the G-proteins decreased the AP-1 activity, whereas their activation enhanced it. Moreover, mutation of the AP-1-binding site abrogated the ability of GÎ±12 and GÎ±13 to induce the TGFÎ²1 gene. Transfection of a dominant-negative mutant of Rho or Rac, but not Cdc42, prevented gene transactivation and decreased AP-1 activity downstream of GÎ±12 and GÎ±13. In summary, GÎ±12 and GÎ±13 regulate the expression of the TGFÎ²1 gene through an increase in Rho/Rac-dependent AP-1 activity, implying that the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-GÎ±12 pathway is involved in the TGFÎ²1-mediated transdifferentiation process."
https://openalex.org/W2090310672,"GRIM-19 (Gene associated with Retinoid-Interferon-induced Mortality 19) is a novel tumor suppressor regulated by interferon/retinoid combination. We have recently shown that GRIM-19 inhibits v-Src-induced oncogenic transformation and metastatic behavior of cells. Oncogenic v-Src induces cell motility by cytoskeletal remodeling, especially the formation of podosomes and. Here, we show that GRIM-19 inhibited the v-Src-induced cell motility by inhibiting cytoskeletal remodeling, that is, podosome formation. We also show that the N terminus of GRIM-19 played a major role in this process and identified critical residues in this region. More importantly, we show that tumor-associated GRIM-19 mutations disrupted its ability to inhibit v-Src-induced cell motility. These actions appear to occur independently of STAT3, a known target of GRIM-19-mediated inhibition. Lastly, tumor-associated GRIM-19 mutants significantly lost their ability to control v-Src-induced metastases in vivo, indicating the biological and pathological significance of these observations."
