https://openalex.org/W2238612799,"Vietnam is a significant consumer of wildlife, particularly wild meat, in urban restaurant settings. To meet this demand, poaching of wildlife is widespread, threatening regional and international biodiversity. Previous interventions to tackle illegal and potentially unsustainable consumption of wild meat in Vietnam have generally focused on limiting supply. While critical, they have been impeded by a lack of resources, the presence of increasingly organised criminal networks and corruption. Attention is, therefore, turning to the consumer, but a paucity of research investigating consumer demand for wild meat will impede the creation of effective consumer-centred interventions. Here we used a mixed-methods research approach comprising a hypothetical choice modelling survey and qualitative interviews to explore the drivers of wild meat consumption and consumer preferences among residents of Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Our findings indicate that demand for wild meat is heterogeneous and highly context specific. Wild-sourced, rare, and expensive wild meat-types are eaten by those situated towards the top of the societal hierarchy to convey wealth and status and are commonly consumed in lucrative business contexts. Cheaper, legal and farmed substitutes for wild-sourced meats are also consumed, but typically in more casual consumption or social drinking settings. We explore the implications of our results for current conservation interventions in Vietnam that attempt to tackle illegal and potentially unsustainable trade in and consumption of wild meat and detail how our research informs future consumer-centric conservation actions."

In an effort to develop a robust assay to detect from urine low-abundant bladder cancer cells carrying well-documented mutations, we have tested the idea first on a set of mock templates, with wild type and known mutants mixed at defined ratios. We have measured the combined error rate for PCR and Illumina sequencing at each nucleotide position of three exons, and demonstrated the power of a UID in distinguishing and correcting errors. In addition, we have demonstrated that PCR sampling bias, rather than PCR errors, challenges the UID-deep sequencing method in faithfully detecting low frequency mutation."
https://openalex.org/W2235128121,"Background The rising prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) worldwide, especially in developing countries, and the persistence of tuberculosis (TB) as a major public health issue in these same regions, emphasize the importance of investigating this association. Here, we compared the clinical profile and disease outcomes of TB patients with or without coincident DM in a TB reference center in Brazil. Methods We performed a retrospective analysis of a TB patient cohort (treatment naïve) of 408 individuals recruited at a TB primary care center in Brazil between 2004 and 2010. Data on diagnosis of TB and DM were used to define the groups. The study groups were compared with regard to TB disease presentation at diagnosis as well as to clinical outcomes such as cure and mortality rates upon anti-tuberculosis therapy (ATT) initiation. A composite score utilizing clinical, radiological and microbiological parameters was used to compare TB severity between the groups. Results DM patients were older than non-diabetic TB patients. In addition, diabetic individuals more frequently presented with cough, night sweats, hemoptysis and malaise than those without DM. The overall pattern of lung lesions assessed by chest radiographic examination was similar between the groups. Compared to non-diabetic patients, those with TB-diabetes exhibited positive acid-fast bacilli in sputum samples more frequently at diagnosis and at 30 days after ATT initiation. Notably, higher values of the TB severity score were significantly associated with TB-diabetes comorbidity after adjustment for confounding factors. Moreover, during ATT, diabetic patients required more frequent transfers to TB reference hospitals for complex clinical management. Nevertheless, overall mortality and cure rates were indistinguishable between the study groups. Conclusions These findings reinforce the idea that diabetes negatively impacts pulmonary TB severity. Our study argues for the systematic screening for DM in TB reference centers in endemic areas."

NatA co-translationally acetylates the N termini of a wide variety of nascent polypeptides. In addition, Naa10 can act independently to posttranslationally acetylate a distinct set of substrates, notably actin. Recent structural studies of Naa10 have also revealed the molecular basis for N-terminal acetylation specificity. Surprisingly, recent reports claim that Naa10 may also acetylate lysine residues of diverse targets, including methionine sulfoxide reductase A, myosin light chain kinase, and Runt-related transcription factor 2. Here we used recombinant proteins to reconstitute and assess lysine acetylation events catalyzed by Naa10 in vitro. We show that there is no difference in lysine acetylation of substrate proteins with or without Naa10, suggesting that the substrates may be acetylated chemically rather than enzymatically. Together, our data argue against a role for Naa10 in lysine acetylation.

https://openalex.org/W2239277471,"The automatic computerized detection of regions of interest (ROI) is an important step in the process of medical image processing and analysis. The reasons are many, and include an increasing amount of available medical imaging data, existence of inter-observer and inter-scanner variability, and to improve the accuracy in automatic detection in order to assist doctors in diagnosing faster and on time. A novel algorithm, based on visual saliency, is developed here for the identification of tumor regions from MR images of the brain. The GBM saliency detection model is designed by taking cue from the concept of visual saliency in natural scenes. A visually salient region is typically rare in an image, and contains highly discriminating information, with attention getting immediately focused upon it. Although color is typically considered as the most important feature in a bottom-up saliency detection model, we circumvent this issue in the inherently gray scale MR framework. We develop a novel pseudo-coloring scheme, based on the three MRI sequences, viz. FLAIR, T2 and T1C (contrast enhanced with Gadolinium). A bottom-up strategy, based on a new pseudo-color distance and spatial distance between image patches, is defined for highlighting the salient regions in the image. This multi-channel representation of the image and saliency detection model help in automatically and quickly isolating the tumor region, for subsequent delineation, as is necessary in medical diagnosis. The effectiveness of the proposed model is evaluated on MRI of 80 subjects from the BRATS database in terms of the saliency map values. Using ground truth of the tumor regions for both high- and low- grade gliomas, the results are compared with four highly referred saliency detection models from literature. In all cases the AUC scores from the ROC analysis are found to be more than 0.999 ± 0.001 over different tumor grades, sizes and positions."
https://openalex.org/W2237810982,"The source-sink relationship determines crop yield, and it is largely regulated by water and nutrients in agricultural production. This has been widely investigated in cereals, but fewer studies have been conducted in root and tuber crops such as potato (Solanum tuberosum L.). The objective of this study was to investigate the source-sink relationship in potato and the regulation of water and nitrogen on the source-sink relationship during the tuber bulking stage. A pot experiment using virus-free plantlets of the Atlantic potato cultivar was conducted, using three water levels (50%, 70% and 90% of field capacity) and three nitrogen levels (0, 0.2, 0.4 g N∙kg−1 soil). The results showed that, under all water and nitrogen levels, plant source capacity were small at the end of the experiment, since photosynthetic activity in leaves were low and non-structural reserves in underground stems were completely remobilized. While at this time, there were very big differences in maximum and minimum tuber number and tuber weight, indicating that the sink tuber still had a large potential capacity to take in assimilates. These results suggest that the source-supplied assimilates were not sufficient enough to meet the demands of sink growth. Thus, we concluded that, unlike cereals, potato yield is more likely to be source-limited than sink-limited during the tuber bulking stage. Water and nitrogen are two key factors in potato production management. Our results showed that water level, nitrogen level and the interaction between water and nitrogen influence potato yield mainly through affecting source capacity via the net photosynthetic rate, total leaf area and leaf life span. Well-watered, sufficient nitrogen and well-watered combined with sufficient nitrogen increased yield mainly by enhancing the source capacity. Therefore, this suggests that increasing source capacity is more crucial to improve potato yield."

Here we investigate the role of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTORC2 in regulating MC collagen expression, a hallmark of fibrotic disease. Relative to normal MCs (non-Fib MCs), MCs derived from fibrotic human lung allografts (Fib-MCs) demonstrated increased phosphoinositide-3kinase (PI3K) dependent activation of both mTORC1 and mTORC2, as measured by increased phosphorylation of S6K1 and 4E-BP1 (mTORC1 substrates) and AKT (an mTORC2 substrate). Dual ATP-competitive TORC1/2 inhibitor AZD8055, in contrast to allosteric mTORC1-specific inhibitor rapamycin, strongly inhibited 4E-BP1 phosphorylation and collagen I expression in Fib-MCs. In non-Fib MCs, increased mTORC1 signaling was shown to augment collagen I expression. mTORC1/4E-BP1 pathway was identified as an important driver of collagen I expression in Fib-MCs in experiments utilizing raptor gene silencing and overexpression of dominant-inhibitory 4E-BP1. Furthermore, siRNA-mediated knockdown of rictor, an mTORC2 partner protein, reduced mTORC1 substrate phosphorylation and collagen expression in Fib-, but not non-Fib MCs, revealing a dependence of mTORC1 signaling on mTORC2 function in activated MCs. Together these studies suggest a novel paradigm where fibrotic activation in MCs increases PI3K dependent mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling and leads to increased collagen I expression via the mTORC1-dependent 4E-BP1/eIF4E pathway.

https://openalex.org/W2233214262,"The ability of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3R) to precisely initiate and generate a diverse variety of intracellular Ca2+ signals is in part mediated by the differential regulation of the three subtypes (R1, R2, and R3) by key functional modulators (IP3, Ca2+, and ATP). However, the contribution of IP3R heterotetramerization to Ca2+ signal diversity has largely been unexplored. In this report, we provide the first definitive biochemical evidence of endogenous heterotetramer formation. Additionally, we examine the contribution of individual subtypes within defined concatenated heterotetramers to the shaping of Ca2+ signals. Under conditions where key regulators of IP3R function are optimal for Ca2+ release, we demonstrate that individual monomers within heteromeric IP3Rs contributed equally toward generating a distinct ‘blended’ sensitivity to IP3 that is likely dictated by the unique IP3 binding affinity of the heteromers. However, under suboptimal conditions where [ATP] were varied, we found that one subtype dictated the ATP regulatory properties of heteromers. We show that R2 monomers within a heterotetramer were both necessary and sufficient to dictate the ATP regulatory properties. Finally, the ATP-binding site B in R2 critical for ATP regulation was mutated and rendered non-functional to address questions relating to the stoichiometry of IP3R regulation. Two intact R2 monomers were sufficient to maintain ATP regulation in R2 homotetramers. In summary, we demonstrate that heterotetrameric IP3R do not necessarily behave as the sum of the constituent subunits, and these properties likely extend the versatility of IP3-induced Ca2+ signaling in cells expressing multiple IP3R isoforms.

The importance of intracellular Ca2+ as a second messenger is underscored by its distinctive ability to regulate a multitude of diverse cellular processes, including transcription, translation, secretion of fluids, muscle contraction, motility, fertilization, memory, apoptosis, and autophagy (1Chin K.V.

This remarkable capacity to precisely and often simultaneously regulate cellular events is thought to be due, at least in part, to the highly sophisticated spatial and temporal control of intracellular [Ca2+] by a complement of specialized proteins, collectively termed the “Ca2+ signaling toolkit” (7Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. Lipp P. Calcium–a life and death signal.Nature. 1998; 395: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (1765) Google Scholar). Simplistically, this “toolkit” includes several Ca2+ influx and release channels whose activation brings about a rise in basal intracellular Ca2+ concentration. In addition, cytosolic Ca2+ buffers, pumps, and transporters function to reduce the intracellular Ca2+ concentration by extrusion into stores or the extracellular space (9Berridge M.J.

The three subtypes share ∼60–70% sequence homology and are conventionally divided into three functional domains. At the extreme N terminus lies the conserved ligand-binding domain, which is composed of a suppressor domain (SD) and a ligand-binding core (15Yoshikawa F. Morita M. Monkawa T. Michikawa T.

The variation in primary amino acid sequence between the three subtypes results in each isoform exhibiting distinct IP3 binding affinities and modulatory properties. For instance, IP3 binding assays performed on the N-terminal 604 amino acids revealed that R2 has an ∼3- and ∼12-fold greater IP3 binding affinity than R1 and R3, respectively (23Iwai M. Michikawa T.

Utilizing permeabilized cell Ca2+ release assays, our group has shown that subtype sensitivity to ATP modulation follows a similar rank order, with R2 shown to have ∼3- and ∼10-fold higher affinity for ATP than R1 and R3, respectively.

Given that IP3Rs are regulated in a subtype-specific manner and that these subtypes likely oligomerize into heterotetramers, the obvious question relates to the contribution of each isoform within a heterotetramer to overall receptor function. Studies in cultured cells or isolated tissues fail to account for the exact proportions of each subtype within a tetramer. To address this, we recently described a strategy whereby concatenated IP3R cDNA constructs were engineered to result in expression of tetrameric channels with defined composition (39Alzayady K.J.

IP3 binding assays further revealed that this distinct IP3 sensitivity is likely dictated by the unique apparent IP3 binding affinity of heteromeric IP3Rs. In contrast, under suboptimal conditions for Ca2+ release through the IP3Rs, where [ATP] was varied, a single isoform was found to dictate the ATP regulatory properties of heteromeric IP3Rs. Finally, using concatenated receptors with mutations in defined numbers of subunits, we address for the first time fundamental questions relating to the stoichiometry of IP3R regulation by ATP.

Mouse monoclonal antibody against residues 22–230 of human R3 (α-R3) was from BD Transduction Laboratories (San Jose, CA). R1 and R2 dimeric constructs were generated by designating IP3R cDNA encoding the corresponding isoforms as “head” and “tail” and modifying them appropriately using a QuikChange mutagenesis strategy as described before (39Alzayady K.J.

R3 head subunits were generated by silently mutating NcoI sites in the rat R3 coding sequence (primers 1–6). After the start codon, an alanine codon was added to enable insertion of a new NcoI site, in addition to a Kozak sequence (primers 7 and 8). The head subunit was further modified by deleting a stop codon and introducing a nucleotide sequence encoding the first half of the linker followed by an AgeI site (primers 9 and 10), immediately after the R3 coding sequence. The R3 tail subunit was generated by introducing an AgeI site followed by a nucleotide sequence encoding the second half of the linker immediately before the start codon (primers 11 and 12). Additionally, a blunt end restriction site (HpaI) was inserted immediately after the stop codon (primers 13 and 14). The coding sequence for all constructs was confirmed by sequencing.

A QuikChange mutagenesis strategy was employed to modify the Walker A-like motif ATPB site in cDNAs encoding the mouse R2 monomer, the R2 dimer head and tail subunits. Briefly, forward and reverse mutagenic primers (primers 15 and 16) were generated by Integrated DNA Technologies to encode mutations at G5940, G5946, and G5955, in addition to silently introducing a PspOMI restriction site. These mutations code for amino acid substitutions G1969A, G1971A, and G1974A, respectively. The coding sequence for all constructs was confirmed by sequencing. The R2R2Δ and R2ΔR2Δ dimers were generated using the same approach used to generate the wild type R2 homodimer, as described above. DT40-3KO cells and DT40-3KO cells stably expressing IP3R constructs were maintained at 39 °C and 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% chicken serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10 μm β-mercaptoethanol. Cells were maintained by subculturing every 3 days. Selection was carried out using G418 sulfate (geneticin).

Nevertheless, the majority of swimming studies is currently limited to two-dimensional analyses. Accurate experimental quantification of changes in body shape, position and orientation (swimming kinematics) in three dimensions is therefore essential to advance biomechanical research of fish swimming. Here, we present a validated method that automatically tracks a swimming fish in three dimensions from multi-camera high-speed video. We use an optimisation procedure to fit a parameterised, morphology-based fish model to each set of video images. This results in a time sequence of position, orientation and body curvature. We post-process this data to derive additional kinematic parameters (e.g. velocities, accelerations) and propose an inverse-dynamics method to compute the resultant forces and torques during swimming. The presented method for quantifying 3D fish motion paves the way for future analyses of swimming biomechanics."
https://openalex.org/W2232793048,"The brain is a large-scale complex network often referred to as the ""connectome"". Cognitive functions and information processing are mainly based on the interactions between distant brain regions. However, most of the 'feature extraction' methods used in the context of Brain Computer Interface (BCI) ignored the possible functional relationships between different signals recorded from distinct brain areas. In this paper, the functional connectivity quantified by the phase locking value (PLV) was introduced to characterize the evoked responses (ERPs) obtained in the case of target and non-targets visual stimuli. We also tested the possibility of using the functional connectivity in the context of 'P300 speller'. The proposed approach was compared to the well-known methods proposed in the state of the art of ""P300 Speller"", mainly the peak picking, the area, time/frequency based features, the xDAWN spatial filtering and the stepwise linear discriminant analysis (SWLDA). The electroencephalographic (EEG) signals recorded from ten subjects were analyzed offline. The results indicated that phase synchrony offers relevant information for the classification in a P300 speller. High synchronization between the brain regions was clearly observed during target trials, although no significant synchronization was detected for a non-target trial. The results showed also that phase synchrony provides higher performance than some existing methods for letter classification in a P300 speller principally when large number of trials is available. Finally, we tested the possible combination of both approaches (classical features and phase synchrony). Our findings showed an overall improvement of the performance of the P300-speller when using Peak picking, the area and frequency based features. Similar performances were obtained compared to xDAWN and SWLDA when using large number of trials."

Although the R4 subfamily of RGS proteins generally accepts both Gαi/o and Gαq/11 subunits as substrates, the R7 and R12 subfamilies select against Gαq/11. In contrast, only one RGS protein, RGS2, is known to be selective for Gαq/11. The molecular basis for this selectivity is not clear. Previously, the crystal structure of RGS2 in complex with Gαq revealed a non-canonical interaction that could be due to interfacial differences imposed by RGS2, the Gα subunit, or both. To resolve this ambiguity, the 2.6 Å crystal structure of RGS8, an R4 subfamily member, was determined in complex with Gαq. RGS8 adopts the same pose on Gαq as it does when bound to Gαi3, indicating that the non-canonical interaction of RGS2 with Gαq is due to unique features of RGS2. Based on the RGS8-Gαq structure, residues in RGS8 that contact a unique α-helical domain loop of Gαq were converted to those typically found in R12 subfamily members, and the reverse substitutions were introduced into RGS10, an R12 subfamily member. Although these substitutions perturbed their ability to stimulate GTP hydrolysis, they did not reverse selectivity.

This study aimed to explore the associations among neutrophil activity, clinical presentation, and role of the M. pneumoniae/interleukin-8 (IL-8)/neutrophil axis in the pathogenesis of MPP. A total of 42 patients with MPP were prospectively enrolled in the study. Neutrophil activity, including matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), myeloperoxidase (MPO), and neutrophil elastase (NE), were measured. Clinical information was collected for all patients and control group. In vitro, IL-8 production was measured at different time points after M. pneumoniae infection of bronchial epithelial cells, and neutrophil activity was analyzed after IL-8 stimulation. The percentage of neutrophil in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was higher in the group of patients with high levels of M. pneumoniae DNA than in those with low levels of M. pneumoniae DNA (P < 0.05). IL-8, MMP-9, and NE in patients with MPP significantly increased compared with controls and decreased after treatment (P < 0.05). MPO and MMP-9 were associated with duration of fever (r = 0.332, P < 0.05) and length of stay (r = 0.342, P < 0.05), respectively. In vitro, M. pneumoniae induced IL-8 production by bronchial epithelial cells in a time dependent manner. MPO, MMP-9 and NE production by neutrophils significantly increased compared with medium controls after IL-8 stimulation. In summary, the M. pneumoniae/IL-8/neutrophil axis likely plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of MPP."
https://openalex.org/W2239127757,"Intelectins (X-type lectins), broadly distributed throughout chordates, have been implicated in innate immunity. Xenopus laevis embryonic epidermal lectin (XEEL), an intelectin secreted into environmental water by the X. laevis embryo, is postulated to function as a defense against microbes. XEEL is homologous (64% identical) to human intelectin-1 (hIntL-1), which is also implicated in innate immune defense. We showed previously that hIntL-1 binds microbial glycans bearing exocyclic vicinal diol groups. It is unknown whether XEEL has the same ligand specificity. Also unclear is whether XEEL and hIntL-1 have similar quaternary structures, as XEEL lacks the corresponding cysteine residues in hIntL-1 that stabilize the disulfide-linked trimer. These observations prompted us to further characterize XEEL. We found that hIntL-1 and XEEL have similar structural features. Even without the corresponding intermolecular disulfide bonds present in hIntL-1, the carbohydrate recognition domain of XEEL (XEELCRD) forms a stable trimer in solution. The structure of XEELCRD in complex with d-glycerol-1-phosphate, a residue present in microbe-specific glycans, indicated that the exocyclic vicinal diol coordinates to a protein-bound calcium ion. This ligand-binding mode is conserved between XEEL and hIntL-1. The domain architecture of full-length XEEL is reminiscent of a barbell, with two sets of three glycan-binding sites oriented in opposite directions. This orientation is consistent with our observation that XEEL can promote the agglutination of specific serotypes of Streptococcus pneumoniae. These data support a role for XEEL in innate immunity, and they highlight structural and functional conservation of X-type lectins among chordates."

https://openalex.org/W2237327453,"Sporopollenin is the main constituent of the exine layer of spore and pollen walls. The anther-specific chalcone synthase-like (ASCL) enzyme of Physcomitrella patens, PpASCL, has previously been implicated in the biosynthesis of sporopollenin, the main constituent of exine and perine, the two outermost layers of the moss spore cell wall. We made targeted knockouts of the corresponding gene, PpASCL, and phenotypically characterized ascl sporophytes and spores at different developmental stages. Ascl plants developed normally until late in sporophytic development, when the spores produced were structurally aberrant and inviable. The development of the ascl spore cell wall appeared to be arrested early in microspore development, resulting in small, collapsed spores with altered surface morphology. The typical stratification of the spore cell wall was absent with only an abnormal perine recognisable above an amorphous layer possibly representing remnants of compromised intine and/or exine. Equivalent resistance of the spore walls of ascl mutants and the control strain to acetolysis suggests the presence of chemically inert, defective sporopollenin in the mutants. Anatomical abnormalities of late-stage ascl sporophytes include a persistent large columella and an air space incompletely filled with spores. Our results indicate that the evolutionarily conserved PpASCL gene is needed for proper construction of the spore wall and for normal maturation and viability of moss spores."
https://openalex.org/W2237963348,"Introduction Although well recognized in breast oncology literature, histologic subtypes have not been previously described in inflammatory breast cancer (IBC). The purpose of this study was to describe lobular subtype in IBC and assess the impact of histology on patient outcomes. Methods We performed a retrospective analysis of 659 IBC patients at MD Anderson Cancer Center between January 1984 and December 2009. Patients with Invasive Lobular, Mixed Invasive Ductal and Lobular, or Invasive Ducal Carcinomas (ILC, MIC, IDC, respectively) comprise the subject of this report. Patient characteristics and survival estimates were compared by using chi-square test and Kaplan-Meier method with log-rank statistic. Cox proportional hazards models were fit to determine association of histology with outcomes after adjustment for other characteristics. Results A total of 30, 37, and 592 patients were seen to have invasive lobular, mixed, or ductal histology, respectively. Grade 3 tumors were more common in the ductal group (78%) than in the lobular (60%) or mixed (61%) group (P = 0.01). The 3-year overall survival rates were 68%, 64%, and 62% in the lobular, mixed, and ductal groups, respectively (P = 0.68). After adjustment, histology did not have a significant effect on death in the lobular group (HR = 0.70, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.26–1.94; P = 0.50) or mixed group (HR = 0.53, 95% CI: 0.25–1.13; P = 0.10) compared with the ductal group. Conclusion In this cohort of IBC patients, lobular histology was seen in 4.5% cases. Histology does not appear to have a significant effect on survival outcomes in IBC patients, unlike in patients with non-inflammatory breast cancer (n-IBC), indicating the distinct biological behavior of the IBC phenotype."

Up-regulation of the histone demethylase KDM4A promotes transient site-specific copy gain (TSSG) in cells; therefore, uncovering how KDM4A levels are controlled is important for understanding the regulation of copy number heterogeneity. Here, we demonstrate that KDM4A is regulated by hsa-mir-23a-3p, hsa-mir-23b-3p, and hsa-mir-137. Altering expression of these microRNAs (miRNAs) regulates KDM4A-dependent TSSG. miRNA inhibition promoted copy gains and increased expression of the drug-resistant oncogene CKS1B, which was further substantiated in primary breast tumors. Consistent with increased CKS1B expression, miRNA inhibition reduced breast cancer cell sensitivity to cisplatin.

Here, we demonstrate that KDM4A is regulated by hsa-mir-23a-3p, hsa-mir-23b-3p, and hsa-mir-137. Altering expression of these microRNAs (miRNAs) regulates KDM4A-dependent TSSG. miRNA inhibition promoted copy gains and increased expression of the drug-resistant oncogene CKS1B, which was further substantiated in primary breast tumors. Consistent with increased CKS1B expression, miRNA inhibition reduced breast cancer cell sensitivity to cisplatin. Our data identify these miRNAs as regulators of TSSG and copy gains of a drug resistance gene."

In the present study, a neutral protease-encoding gene, Banpr, was cloned from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strain K11, and a genetic manipulation method specific for this difficult-to-transform strain was developed for the high-level expression of neutral protease. The recombinant plasmid pUB110-Banpr was constructed in Bacillus subtilis strain WB600 and then transformed into strain K11 under optimized conditions. A positive transformant 110N-6 with the highest protease secreting capacity on skim milk plates and great genetic stability for more than 100 generations was selected for further study. Optimization of the fermentation conditions increased the enzyme activity of strain 110N-6 to 8995 ± 250 U/ml in flask culture and 28084 ± 1282 U/ml in 15-l fermentor, which are significantly higher than that of the native strain K11 and industrial strain B. subtilis AS.1398, respectively. The high expression level and extreme genetic stability make B. amyloliquefaciens strain 110N-6 more favorable for mass production of neutral protease for industrial uses."
https://openalex.org/W2239286120,"Binding to mucin is the initial step for enteropathogens to establish pathogenesis. An open reading frame, gbpA, of Vibrio vulnificus was identified and characterized in this study. Compared with wild type, the gbpA mutant was impaired in binding to mucin-agar and the mucin-secreting HT29-methotrexate cells, and the impaired mucin binding was restored by the purified GbpA provided exogenously. The gbpA mutant had attenuated virulence and ability of intestinal colonization in a mouse model, indicating that GbpA is a mucin-binding protein and essential for pathogenesis of V. vulnificus. The gbpA transcription was growth phase-dependent, reaching a maximum during the exponential phase. The Fe-S cluster regulator (IscR) and the cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP) coactivated, whereas SmcR, a LuxR homologue, repressed gbpA. The cellular levels of IscR, CRP, and SmcR were not significantly affected by one another, indicating that the regulator proteins function cooperatively to regulate gbpA rather than sequentially in a regulatory cascade. The regulatory proteins directly bind upstream of the gbpA promoter PgbpA. DNase I protection assays, together with the deletion analyses of PgbpA, demonstrated that IscR binds to two specific sequences centered at −164.5 and −106, and CRP and SmcR bind specifically to the sequences centered at −68 and −45, respectively. Furthermore, gbpA was induced by exposure to H2O2, and the induction appeared to be mediated by elevated intracellular levels of IscR. Consequently, the combined results indicated that IscR, CRP, and SmcR cooperate for precise regulation of gbpA during the V. vulnificus pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2232841528,"Leaf senescence is a finely regulated complex process; however, evidence for the involvement of epigenetic processes in the regulation of leaf senescence is still fragmentary. Therefore, we chose to examine the functions of DRD1, a SWI2/SNF2 chromatin remodeling protein, in epigenetic regulation of leaf senescence, particularly because drd1-6 mutants exhibited a delayed leaf senescence phenotype. Photosynthetic parameters such as Fv/Fm and ETRmax were decreased in WT leaves compared to leaves of drd1-6 mutants after dark treatment. The WT leaves remarkably lost more chlorophyll and protein content during dark-induced senescence (DIS) than the drd1-6 leaves did. The induction of senescence-associated genes was noticeably inhibited in the drd1-6 mutant after 5-d of DIS. We compared changes in epigenetic regulation during DIS via quantitative expression analysis of 180-bp centromeric (CEN) and transcriptionally silent information (TSI) repeats. Their expression levels significantly increased in both the WT and the drd1-6 mutant, but did much less in the latter. Moreover, the delayed leaf senescence was observed in ddm1-2 mutants as well as the drd1-6, but not in drd1-p mutants. These data suggest that SWI2/SNF2 chromatin remodeling proteins such as DRD1 and DDM1 may influence leaf senescence possibly via epigenetic regulation."

Moreover, the seedlings of orchid species from the same genus are similar. The objective of DNA barcoding is rapid, accurate, and automated species identification, which may be used to identify illegally traded endangered species from vegetative specimens of Paphiopedilum (Venus slipper), a flagship group for plant conservation with high ornamental and commercial values. Here, we selected eight chloroplast barcodes and nrITS to evaluate their suitability in Venus slippers. The results indicate that all tested barcodes had no barcoding gap and the core plant barcodes showed low resolution for the identification of Venus slippers (18.86%). Of the single-locus barcodes, nrITS is the most efficient for the species identification of the genus (52.27%), whereas matK + atpF-atpH is the most efficient multi-locus combination (28.97%). Therefore, we recommend the combination of matK + atpF-atpH + ITS as a barcode for Venus slippers. Furthermore, there is an upper limit of resolution of the candidate barcodes, and only half of the taxa with multiple samples were identified successfully. The low efficiency of these candidate barcodes in Venus slippers may be caused by relatively recent speciation, the upper limit of the barcodes, and/or the sampling density. Although the discriminatory power is relatively low, DNA barcoding may be a promising tool to identify species involved in illegal trade, which has broad applications and is valuable for orchid conservation."
https://openalex.org/W2235600279,"Maternal effects are ubiquitous in nature and affect a wide range of offspring phenotypes. Recent research suggests that maternal effects also contribute to ageing, but the theoretical basis for these observations is poorly understood. Here we develop a simple model to derive expectations for (i) if maternal effects on ageing evolve; (ii) the strength of maternal effects on ageing relative to direct environmental effects; and (iii) the predicted relationships between environmental quality, maternal age and offspring lifespan. Our model is based on the disposable soma theory of ageing, and the key assumption is thus that mothers trade off their own somatic maintenance against investment in offspring. This trade-off affects the biological age of offspring at birth in terms of accumulated damage, as indicated by biomarkers such as oxidative stress or telomere length. We find that the optimal allocation between investment in maternal somatic investment and investment in offspring results in old mothers and mothers with low resource availability producing offspring with reduced life span. Furthermore, the effects are interactive, such that the strongest maternal age effects on offspring lifespan are found under low resource availability. These findings are broadly consistent with results from laboratory studies investigating the onset and rate of ageing and field studies examining maternal effects on ageing in the wild."
https://openalex.org/W2238252677,"Nasal hyperresponsiveness (NHR) is a characteristic feature of allergic rhinitis (AR); however, the pathogenesis of NHR is not fully understood. In this study, during the establishment of an experimental AR model using ovalbumin-immunized and -challenged mice, augmentation of the sneezing reaction in response to nonspecific proteins as well as a chemical stimulant was detected. Whether NHR is independent of mast cells and eosinophils was determined by using mast cell- and eosinophil-deficient mice. NHR was suppressed by treatment with anti-CD4 antibody, suggesting the pivotal contribution of CD4+ T cells. Furthermore, antigen challenge to mice to which in vitro-differentiated Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells but not naïve CD4+ T cells had been adoptively transferred led to the development of equivalent NHR. Since antigen-specific IgE and IgG were not produced in these mice and since antigen-specific IgE-transgenic mice did not develop NHR even upon antigen challenge, humoral immunity would be dispensable for NHR. CD4+ T cells play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of AR via induction of NHR, independent of IgE-, mast cell-, and eosinophil-mediated responses."

Polygalacturonase-inhibiting proteins (PGIPs) are leucine-rich repeat proteins that plants produce against polygalacturonase, a key virulence agent in pathogens. In this paper, we cloned and purified CkPGIP1, a gene product from Cynanchum komarovii that effectively inhibits polygalacturonases from Botrytis cinerea and Rhizoctonia solani. We found the expression of CkPGIP1 to be induced in response to salicylic acid, wounding, and infection with B. cinerea and R. solani. In addition, transgenic overexpression in Arabidopsis enhanced resistance against B. cinerea. Furthermore, CkPGIP1 obtained from transgenic Arabidopsis inhibited the activity of B. cinerea and R. solani polygalacturonases by 62.7–66.4% and 56.5–60.2%, respectively. Docking studies indicated that the protein interacts strongly with the B1-sheet at the N-terminus of the B. cinerea polygalacturonase, and with the C-terminus of the polygalacturonase from R. solani. This study highlights the significance of CkPGIP1 in plant disease resistance, and its possible application to manage fungal pathogens."

Triglycerides (TG), apoB48 and apoB100 in TG-rich lipoproteins (chylomicrons, VLDL1 and VLDL2) were measured after the fat-rich meal.Postprandial responses (area under the curve, AUC) for glucose, insulin, GLP-1, GLP-2, GIP in plasma, and TG, apoB48 and apoB100 in plasma and TG-rich lipoproteins.The GLP-1, GLP-2 and GIP responses after the fat-rich meal and after the OGTT correlated strongly (r = 0.73, p<0.0001; r = 0.46, p<0.001 and r = 0.69, p<0.001, respectively). Glucose and insulin AUCs were lower, but the AUCs for GLP-1, GLP-2 and GIP were significantly higher after the fat-rich meal than after the OGTT. The peak value for all hormones appeared at 120 minutes after the fat-rich meal, compared to 30 minutes after the OGTT. After the fat-rich meal, the AUCs for GLP-1, GLP-2 and GIP correlated significantly with plasma TG- and apoB48 AUCs but the contribution was very modest.In obese males, GLP-1, GLP-2 and GIP responses to a fat-rich meal are greater than following an OGTT. However, the most important explanatory variable for postprandial TG excursion was fasting triglycerides. The contribution of endogenous GLP-1, GLP-2 and GIP to explaining the variance in postprandial TG excursion was minor."
https://openalex.org/W2233418025,"Understanding the role of hypothalamic neuropeptides and hormones in energy balance is paramount in the search for approaches to mitigate the obese state. Increased hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity leads to increased levels of glucocorticoids (GC) that are known to regulate body weight. The axis initiates the production and release of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) from the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus. Levels of active CRH peptide are dependent on the processing of its precursor pro-CRH by the action of two members of the family of prohormone convertases 1 and 2 (PC1 and PC2). Here, we propose that the nutrient sensor sirtuin 1 (Sirt1) regulates the production of CRH post-translationally by affecting PC2. Data suggest that Sirt1 may alter the preproPC2 gene directly or via deacetylation of the transcription factor Forkhead box protein O1 (FoxO1). Data also suggest that Sirt1 may alter PC2 via a post-translational mechanism. Our results show that Sirt1 levels in the PVN increase in rats fed a high fat diet for 12 weeks. Furthermore, elevated Sirt1 increased PC2 levels, which in turn increased the production of active CRH and GC. Collectively, this study provides the first evidence supporting the hypothesis that PVN Sirt1 activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and basal GC levels by enhancing the production of CRH through an increase in the biosynthesis of PC2, which is essential in the maturation of CRH from its prohormone, pro-CRH.

https://openalex.org/W2235091807,"Sedentary behaviors are reported to impose health risks. Since occupational exposure is a major proportion of total sedentary time, we studied the association between occupational sitting and a number of health problems.From the longitudinal Doetinchem Cohort Study, we selected those working at baseline with complete data (n = 1,509). Participants were examined four times at 5 year-intervals between 1993 and 2012. We characterized occupational sitting as follows: 1) stable sitters and stable non sitters over a 15-year period, based on job characteristics and (2) having a job with a low, moderate or high amount of sitting, based on tertiles of self-reported number of hours per week of occupational sitting, measured at wave 5. Linear and logistic regression models were used. Outcomes were self-reported mental health, low-back or upper extremity pain, and objectively measured cardiometabolic health (overweight, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia).Compared to stable non sitters, a lower risk of chronic upper extremity pain was observed for stable sitters (OR 0.75, 95% CI: 0.57; 1.00) as well as for those in the two upper tertiles for hours of occupational sitting (>4 hr/wk) (OR 0.65; 95%CI 0.50-0.86). For the other health outcomes studied, no significant associations were found with occupational sitting.Our findings do not support the hypothesis that occupational sitting is associated with health problems. The finding that occupational sitting is associated with less upper extremity pain might be due to the association of occupational sitting with less physical load."
https://openalex.org/W2239200821,"Chemotherapy is the only choice for most of the advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients, while few agents were available, making it an urgent need to develop new chemotherapy strategies. A phase II clinical trial suggested that the efficacy of irinotecan in HCC was limited due to dose-dependent toxicities. Here, we found that gefitinib exhibited synergistic activity in combination with SN-38, an active metabolite of irinotecan, in HCC cell lines. And the enhanced apoptosis induced by gefitinib plus SN-38 was a result from caspase pathway activation. Mechanistically, gefitinib dramatically promoted the ubiquitin–proteasome-dependent degradation of Rad51 protein, suppressed the DNA repair, gave rise to more DNA damages, and ultimately resulted in the synergism of these two agents. In addition, the increased antitumor efficacy of gefitinib combined with irinotecan was further validated in a HepG2 xenograft mice model. Taken together, our data demonstrated for the first time that the combination of irinotecan and gefitinib showed potential benefit in HCC, which suggests that Rad51 is a promising target and provides a rationale for clinical trials investigating the efficacy of the combination of topoisomerase I inhibitors and gefitinib in HCC."
https://openalex.org/W2235319054,This study examined the potential of iontophoresis in topical photodynamic therapy (PDT) of human invasive squamous cells carcinomas (SCC). SCC was induced in nude BALB/c mice by subcutaneous injection of A431 cells. Tumor penetration and distribution of the photosensitizer tetrasulfonated zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPcS4) was investigated after 10 and 30 min of in vivo iontophoresis of a gel containing ZnPcS4. PDT was performed immediately after iontophoresis using laser at 660 nm with a dose of irradiation of 100 J/cm(2) and irradiance of 48 mW/cm(2) while tumor growth was measured for 30 days. Iontophoresis increased ZnPcS4 penetration into tumors by 6-fold after 30 min when compared with passive delivery. Confocal microscopy analysis showed that ZnPcS4 was homogeneous distributed within deep regions of the tumor after iontophoresis. Irradiation of the tumors immediately after iontophoresis showed reduction in tumor size by more than 2-fold when compared to non-treated tumors. Iontophoretic-PDT treated tumors presented large areas of necrosis. The study concluded that iontophoretic delivery of photosensitizers could be a valuable strategy for topical PDT of invasive SCC.

Here we describe the archaeal and bacterial communities from soils of the Atlantic Rainforest in Brazil. Based on the comparison of three areas located along an altitudinal gradient-namely, Santa Virginia, Picinguaba and Restinga-we detected the most abundant groups of Bacteria (Acidobacteria and Proteobacteria) and Archaea (Thaumarchaeota, Crenarchaeota and Euryarchaeota). The particular composition of such communities in each of these areas was first evidenced by PCR-DGGE patterns [determined for Bacteria, Archaea and ammonia-oxidizing organisms-ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB)]. Moreover, sequence-based analysis provided a better resolution of communities, which indicated distinct frequencies of archaeal phyla and bacterial OTUs across areas. We found, as indicated by the Mantel test and multivariate analyses, a potential effect of the flora composition that outpaces the effect of soil characteristics (either physical and chemical) influencing the assembly of these microbial communities in soils. Our results indicate a collective role of the ecosystem underlying observed differences in microbial communities in these soils. Particularly, we posit that rainforest preservation also needs to take into account the maintenance of the soil biodiversity, as this is prompted to influence major processes that affect ecosystem functioning."

Until it captures complete coverage of vital events, Malawi relies on other data sources to calculate mortality estimates. We tested a community-based method to estimate annual under-five mortality rates (U5MR) through the Real-Time Monitoring of Under-Five Mortality (RMM) project in Malawi. We implemented RMM in two phases, and conducted an independent evaluation of phase one after 21 months of implementation. We present results of the phase two validation that covers the full project time span, and compare the results to those of the phase one validation.We assessed the completeness of the counts of births and deaths and the accuracy of disaggregated U5MR from the community-based method against a retrospective full pregnancy history for rolling twelve-month periods after the independent evaluation. We used full pregnancy histories collected through household interviews carried out between November 2013 and January 2014 as the validation data source. Health Surveillance Agents (HSAs) across the 160 catchment areas submitted routine reports on pregnancies, births, and deaths consistently. However, for the 15-month implementation period post-evaluation, average completeness of birth event reporting was 76%, whereas average completeness of death event reporting was 67% relative to that expected from a comparable pregnancy history. HSAs underestimated the U5MR by an average of 21% relative to that estimated from a comparable pregnancy history.On a medium scale, the community-based RMM method in Malawi produced substantial underestimates of annualized U5MR relative to those obtained from a full pregnancy history, despite the additional incentives and quality-control activities. We were not able to achieve an optimum level of incentive and support to make the system work while ensuring sustainability. Lessons learned from the implementation of RMM can inform programs supporting community-based interventions through HSAs in Malawi."
https://openalex.org/W2235698217,"Background Measuring fetal drug concentrations is extremely difficult in humans. We conducted a study in pregnant sheep to simultaneously describe maternal and fetal concentrations of propofol, a common intravenous anesthetic agent used in humans. Compared to inhalational anesthesia, propofol supplemented anesthesia lowered the dose of desflurane required to provide adequate uterine relaxation during open fetal surgery. This resulted in better intraoperative fetal cardiac outcome. This study describes maternal and fetal propofol pharmacokinetics (PK) using a chronically instrumented maternal-fetal sheep model. Methods Fetal and maternal blood samples were simultaneously collected from eight mid-gestational pregnant ewes during general anesthesia with propofol, remifentanil and desflurane. Nonlinear mixed-effects modeling was performed by using NONMEM software. Total body weight, gestational age and hemodynamic parameters were tested in the covariate analysis. The final model was validated by bootstrapping and visual predictive check. Results A total of 160 propofol samples were collected. A 2-compartment maternal PK model with a third fetal compartment appropriately described the data. Mean population parameter estimates for maternal propofol clearance and central volume of distribution were 4.17 L/min and 37.7 L, respectively, in a typical ewe with a median heart rate of 135 beats/min. Increase in maternal heart rate significantly correlated with increase in propofol clearance. The estimated population maternal-fetal inter-compartment clearance was 0.0138 L/min and the volume of distribution of propofol in the fetus was 0.144 L. Fetal propofol clearance was found to be almost negligible compared to maternal clearance and could not be robustly estimated. Conclusions For the first time, a maternal-fetal PK model of propofol in pregnant ewes was successfully developed. This study narrows the gap in our knowledge in maternal-fetal PK model in human. Our study confirms that maternal heart rate has an important influence on the pharmacokinetics of propofol during pregnancy. Much lower propofol concentration in the fetus compared to maternal concentrations explain limited placental transfer in in-vivo paired model, and less direct fetal cardiac depression we observed earlier with propofol supplemented inhalational anesthesia compared to higher dose inhalational anesthesia in humans and sheep."

The present article analyzes the secular trend in suicide at the national level between the years 2000 and 2013.All suicides during the study period (n = 64,298, of which 82.11% were men) were characterized using a spectral decomposition of the time series and a wavelet analysis to evaluate the effect of seasonal changes, type of area (urban versus rural) and sex.A seasonal pattern was observed with statistically significant cycles every 12 months, where peaks were identified in May but only for men in urban zones as of the year 2007. In addition, specific days of the year were found to have a higher frequency of suicides, which coincided with holidays (New Year, Mother's Day, Mexican Independence Day and Christmas).A wavelet analysis can be used to decompose complex time series. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of this technique to the study of suicides in developing countries. This analysis enabled identifying a seasonal pattern among urban men in Mexico. The identification of seasonal patterns can help to create primary prevention strategies, increase the dissemination of crisis intervention strategies and promote mental health. These strategies could be emphasized during specific periods of the year and directed towards profiles with a higher risk."

Given the recent revelations that HDL also contains greater than 90 “minor” proteins (HDL Proteome Watch, maintained by the Davidson Laboratory), apoA-I is likely an important scaffold that coordinates these factors to affect functions related to lipid metabolism, inflammation, innate immunity, and more (6Shah A.S.

Lipid Res. 2013; 54: 2575-2585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Since the first descriptions of amphipathic helices inferred in the sequence of apoA-I in the 1970s (7Segrest J.P. Amphipathic helixes and plasma lipoproteins: thermodynamic and geometric considerations.Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1977; 18: 7-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 8Segrest J.P. Feldmann R.J. Amphipathic helixes and plasma lipoproteins: a computer study.Biopolymers. 1977; 16: 2053-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), considerable effort has been put into understanding apoA-I structure in its lipid-free form or when bound to lipid in HDL. With its flexibility and propensity to interact with lipid or itself (oligomerization), it has not yet been possible to apply traditional high resolution structural techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance or x-ray crystallography to full-length, wild-type apoA-I. However, there has been success using deletion mutants. Borhani et al. (9Borhani D.W. Rogers D.P. Engler J.A. Brouillette C.G. Crystal structure of truncated human apolipoprotein A-I suggests a lipid-bound conformation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 12291-12296Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar) crystallized human apoA-I lacking the N-terminal 43 amino acids. The structure showed a ring-like tetramer with amphipathic helical domains coiled around each other. This was thought to reflect the lipid-bound form and became the basis for the double belt model of apoA-I (10Li L. Chen J. Mishra V.K. Kurtz J.A. Cao D. Klon A.E. Harvey S.C. Anantharamaiah G.M. Segrest J.P. Double belt structure of discoidal high density lipoproteins: molecular basis for size heterogeneity.J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 343: 1293-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, information about the monomeric, lipid-free form remained elusive but highly sought after, even prompting the publication of a falsified structure (11Borrell B. Fraud Rocks Protein Community.Nature. 2009; 462: 970Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Recently, Mei and Atkinson (12Mei X. Atkinson D. Crystal structure of C-terminal truncated apolipoprotein A-I reveals the assembly of high density lipoprotein (HDL) by dimerization.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 38570-38582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) published a crystal structure of a mutant lacking the C-terminal 60 amino acids, apoA-IΔ185–243. It showed a curved dimer in which two four-helix bundles were connected by a pair of long antiparallel helices. This strongly resembled a structure of a dimeric apoA-IV mutant that we reported (13Deng X. Morris J. Dressmen J. Tubb M.R. Tso P. Jerome W.G. Davidson W.S. Thompson T.B. The structure of dimeric apolipoprotein A-IV and its mechanism of self-association.Structure. 2012; 20: 767-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These “helix-swapped” models are attractive in that they offer clear predictions of how: (i) a four-helix bundle can transition to the widely accepted double belt orientation upon lipid binding, and (ii) the dimer can transition to monomeric or trimeric forms (14Deng X. Walker R.G. Morris J. Davidson W.S. Thompson T.B. Role of conserved proline residues in human apolipoprotein A-IV structure and function.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 10689-10702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Because apolipoproteins exhibit significant conformational flexibility, we investigated the structure of the truncated apoA-IΔ185–243 in both its dimeric and monomeric forms in solution to draw comparisons to the crystal structure. We used the lower resolution, but solution-based, techniques of chemical cross-linking and small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS). Our results confirm some of the general features of the crystal structure from Mei and Atkinson including the long antiparallel helices participating in the domain swap, but we note important differences in the flexibility of the N-terminal domain and the overall shape of the molecule. Our previously reported construct for recombinant, full-length apoA-I (15Tubb M.R. Smith L.E. Davidson W.S. Purification of recombinant apolipoproteins A-I and A-IV and efficient affinity tag cleavage by tobacco etch virus protease.J. Lipid Res. 2009; 50: 1497-1504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) was modified with a stop codon (TAG) after Asn184. The mutant apoA-IΔ185–243 was then expressed and purified as described (15Tubb M.R. Smith L.E. Davidson W.S. Purification of recombinant apolipoproteins A-I and A-IV and efficient affinity tag cleavage by tobacco etch virus protease.J. Lipid Res. 2009; 50: 1497-1504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). pET30 vectors (Novagen) containing mutant apoA-IΔ185–243 were transformed into BL-21 Escherichia coli cells. Cells were grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani culture medium containing kanamycin for selection of pET30 transformants. Protein expression was induced by addition of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (0.1 mm) followed by shaking at 225 RPM for 2 h at 37 °C. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation, supernatant was discarded, and cells were resuspended in binding buffer (5 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9) and lysed at 4 °C by probe sonication. The cell lysate was pelleted, and the supernatant was applied to His bind columns. Fractions containing apoA-IΔ185–243 were pooled, and the His tag was cleaved by tobacco etch virus protease at a mass ratio of 20 (apoA-I):1 (tobacco etch virus) for 2 h at room temperature. The sample was reapplied to the His bind resin to remove the His tag, and fractions containing apoA-IΔ185–243 were pooled, concentrated, and dialyzed into 10 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8.1, lyophilized to dryness, and stored at −80 °C until ready for use. The recombinant protein contained an additional glycine at the N terminus after cleavage of the His tag by tobacco etch virus. The sequence was confirmed by the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Sequencing Core. 15N-Labeled apoA-IΔ185–243 was generated as previously described (16Walker R.G. Deng X. Melchior J.T. Morris J. Tso P. Jones M.K. Segrest J.P. Thompson T.B. Davidson W.S.

Chem. 2014; 289: 5596-5608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). 14N and 15N versions of apoA-IΔ185–243 were solubilized individually in 3 m guanidine in Tris-HCl. The 14N and 15N apoA-IΔ185–243 were mixed at a 1:1 molar ratio at 37 °C for 1 h with intermediate vortexing. Protein was refolded with exhaustive dialysis against PBS, pH 7.4. Where indicated, apoA-IΔ185–243 was not subjected to denaturation (i.e. left in solution) to characterize any differences that may occur in the denaturation/reassembly process. All protein preparations were further purified using size exclusion chromatography using a single Superdex 200 gel filtration column (10/300 GL; GE Healthcare) on a Äkta FPLC system (GE Healthcare) in PBS to ensure removal of any bacterial protein contamination. Appropriate fractions were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration for cross-linking and SAXS. Protein concentration was determined by the Markwell modified Lowry assay (17Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. Protein measurement with the Folin phenol reagent.J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purity was routinely >95% as determined by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry. All proteins were cross-linked with bis-(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (BS3) (Thermo Scientific) as previously described (16Walker R.G. Deng X. Melchior J.T. Morris J. Tso P. Jones M.K. Segrest J.P. Thompson T.B. Davidson W.S. The structure of human apolipoprotein A-IV as revealed by stable isotope-assisted cross-linking, molecular dynamics and small angle x-ray scattering.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 5596-5608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Protein was cross-linked at a molar ratio of 50:1 cross-linker to protein for 12 h at 4 °C and quenched by excess Tris-HCl. Cross-linked monomeric and dimeric apoA-IΔ185–243 were separated by gel filtration chromatography on three Superdex 200 gel filtration columns (10/300 GL; GE Healthcare) in series on a Äkta FPLC system (GE Healthcare) in PBS at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. 0.25-ml fractions were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Fractions containing the pure monomeric and dimeric apoA-IΔ185–243 were pooled and concentrated. Samples undergoing MS analysis were dialyzed into 10 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8.1. 50-μg aliquots were digested with sequencing grade trypsin (Promega) at 1:20 mass ratio of trypsin to protein for 16 h at 37 °C. Peptides cross-linked with BS3 were lyophilized to dryness and stored at −20 °C until MS analysis. Cross-linking experiments were performed on two independent preparations of protein. Mass spectrometry analyses were performed as previously described (16Walker R.G. Deng X. Melchior J.T. Morris J. Tso P. Jones M.K. Segrest J.P. Thompson T.B. Davidson W.S.

Chem. 2014; 289: 5596-5608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Nano-LC-MS/MS analyses were performed on a TripleTOF® 5600+ (AB Sciex, Toronto, Canada) coupled to an Eksigent (Dublin, CA) NanoLC-Ultra® nanoflow system. Dried samples were reconstituted in formic acid/H2O 0.1/99.9 (v/v), and 5 μl (∼1–2 μg of digest) was loaded onto C18 IntegraFritTM trap column (New Objective, Inc.) at 2 μl/min in FA/H2O 0.1/99.9 (v/v) for 15 min to desalt and concentrate the samples. For the chromatographic separation, the trap column was switched to align with the analytical column, Acclaim® PepMap100 (Dionex-Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptides were eluted at 300 nl/min using a varying mobile phase gradient from 95% phase A (FA/H2O 0.1/99.9, v/v) to 40% phase B (FA/ACN 0.1/99.9 v/v) for 35 min (1% per min), then from 40% B to 85% B in 5 min with re-equilibration. Effluent was introduced to the mass spectrometer using a NANOSpray® III source (AB Sciex, Toronto, Canada). The instrument was operated in positive ion mode for 65 min, where each cycle consisted of one TOF-MS scan (0.25 s of accumulation time, in a 350–1500 m/z window) followed by 30 information-dependent acquisition mode MS/MS scans on the most intense candidate ions selected from initially performed TOF-MS scan during each cycle. Each product ion scan had an accumulation time of 0.075 s and CE of 43 with an 8-unit scan range. The .wiff files were converted to Mascot generic files using PeakView® v1.2.0.3 software (AB Sciex). Mascot generic files were loaded into the SIM-XL search engine (18Lima D.B. de Lima T.B. Balbuena T.S. Neves-Ferreira A.G. Barbosa V.C. Gozzo F.C. Carvalho P.C. SIM-XL: A powerful and user-friendly tool for peptide cross-linking analysis.J. Proteomics. 2015; 129: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) for cross-linked peptides link version 1.1. Briefly, this latest version is optimized for characterizing interaction between homodimers by allowing the user to specify which proteins(s) in the sequence database have light (e.g. 14N) and heavy (e.g. 15N) versions. The carbamidomethylation of the cysteine and the BS3 cross-linker mass modification of 138.0681 at the N terminus and lysine was considered as fixed. A tolerance of 20 ppm was accepted at the MS1 and MS2 levels. All initial identification of cross-linked peptides required a SIM-XL primary score greater than 1.5. Because a single incorrect cross-link identification may lead to an erroneous model, a manual postvalidation of the search engine results, at the MS/MS level, was independently performed by two experienced analysts. SAXS data were collected using the SIBYLS beamline (Berkeley, CA) (19Dyer K.N. Hammel M. Rambo R.P. Tsutakawa S.E. Rodic I. Classen S. Tainer J.A. Hura G.L. High-throughput SAXS for the characterization of biomolecules in solution: a practical approach.Methods Mol. Biol. 2014; 1091: 245-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Cross-linked, monomeric, and dimeric apoA-IΔ185–243 were separated by gel filtration chromatography as described above. Purified samples were shipped overnight at 4 °C for SAXS data collection within 24 h of isolation to avoid aggregation artifacts. Three concentrations of the purified monomeric and dimeric apoA-IΔ185–243 in PBS were sampled at 10 °C with four exposure times; 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 5.0 s. Scattering profiles from samples suffering radiation damage were discarded. ScÅtter (SIBYLS) and ATSAS program suite (EMBL) were used for data analysis. 20 independent ab initio molecular envelope reconstructions were generated using the online DAMMIF server (EMBL-Hamburg) (20Franke S.D. DAMMIF, a program for rapid ab initio shape determination in small-angle scattering.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2009; 42: 342-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar). The envelopes were superimposed and averaged using SUPCOMB and DAMAVER (ATSAS, EMBL-Hamburg). The averaged molecular envelope graphics were rendered using UCSF Chimera. Three-dimensional composite models were generated based on the dimeric crystal structure of apoA-IΔ185–243 (Protein Data Bank entry 3R2P). The structure was manually manipulated in PyMOL guided by experimentally derived cross-links and SAXS data. Modeler v9.14 (21Sali A. Blundell T.L. Comparative protein modelling by satisfaction of spatial restraints.J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10512) Google Scholar) was used to perform a sequence alignment and generate 100 iterations of each starting model. Models were constrained with identified cross-links with an upper bound of 26.0 ± 0.001 Å from C-α to C-α. The starting model for reported structures were chosen based on the best fit to experimental SAXS data using FoXS (22Schneidman-Duhovny D. Hammel M. Tainer J.A. Sali A.

An energy minimization was performed on the initial structure using the AllosMod-FoXS web server (23Schneidman-Duhovny D. Hammel M. Sali A.

Deng X. Melchior J.T. Morris J. Tso P. Jones M.K. Segrest J.P. Thompson T.B. Davidson W.S.

The final models were presented based on satisfaction of all cross-linking constraints and best fit to the experimental SAXS scattering profile. A problem with using chemical cross-linking to understand the structure of a homodimer is the inability to distinguish between intra- and intermolecular cross-links. In previous work with apoA-IV, we solved this problem by isotopically labeling one polypeptide of the dimer with 15N, leaving the other with naturally occurring 14N (16Walker R.G. Deng X. Melchior J.T. Morris J. Tso P. Jones M.K. Segrest J.P. Thompson T.B. Davidson W.S.

Chem. 2014; 289: 5596-5608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The two forms were expressed in bacteria grown with the appropriate nitrogen isotope, denatured in guanidine HCl, mixed together at a 1:1 molar ratio, and then allowed to refold into dimers with mixed isotopic species. We pursued the same strategy with apoA-IΔ185–243 (see “Experimental Procedures”). Fig. 1 illustrates the concept. Intermolecular cross-links between two peptides (A and B) result in four possible mass combinations depending on the isotopic makeup of the two species in a dimer: 14A to 14B, 15A to 15B, 14A to 15B, and 15A to 14B and a MS spectrum containing four sets of peaks (top panel). Alternatively, intramolecular cross-links only have two possibilities, 14A to 14B and 15A to 15B, resulting in two sets of peaks (bottom panel). Fig. 2a contrasts WT apoA-I (28 kDa) with apoA-IΔ185–243 (22 kDa). The high purity of both preparations is apparent on the SDS gel and by direct injection MS of a mixture of both 14N apoA-IΔ185–243 and 15N apoA-IΔ185–243 (Fig. 2b). 14N apoA-IΔ185–243 exhibited an experimental molecular mass of 21,624 Da, nearly identical to its theoretical mass of 21,623.96 Da. 15N apoA-IΔ185–243 had an experimental molecular mass of 21,890 Da compared with a theoretical 21,894.25 Da. From both direct injection MS and peptide analyses, we determined that our labeling efficiency was >95%. We observed that unfolding the protein in guanidine HCl affected the relative monomer/dimer distribution of the truncation mutant (Fig. 3). When 14N apoA-IΔ185–243 was isolated directly from the bacteria without a refolding step, the preparation contained ∼60% monomer and 40% dimer by gel filtration chromatography at room temperature. However, denaturation in guanidine and refolding via dialysis resulted in a shift to the monomeric state (∼90%) with only ∼10% dimer. This agrees with a previous characterization of this mutant (25Laccotripe M. Makrides S.C. Jonas A. Zannis V.I. The carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic residues of apolipoprotein A-I affect its rate of phospholipid binding and its association with high density lipoprotein.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17511-17522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). This may result from concentration differences between compartments within the bacteria and bulk solution in vitro. Because it is not possible to perform the dual isotope technique with nonrefolded protein, we scaled up our separations to isolate enough dimer for the current cross-linking studies. We used the homobifunctional cross-linker BS3, an NHS ester with a preference for lysines within its spacer arm length of 12 Å. However, it can also react with serine at a lower frequency (26Swaim C.L. Smith J.B. Smith D.L. Unexpected products from the reaction of the synthetic cross-linker 3,3′-dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidyl propionate), DTSSP with peptides.J. Am. Soc.

Mixed 14N and 15N apoA-IΔ185–243 was cross-linked, yielding the monomeric and dimeric species shown in Fig. 4a (lane 1). Monomer and dimer were then isolated by gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 4b, lanes 1 and 2, respectively). The samples were subjected to tryptic digestion, and MS was used to identify the cross-links. In total, 29 cross-linked peptide pairs were identified in both monomeric and dimeric apoA-IΔ185–243; intramolecular cross-links are listed in Table 1 and intermolecular links are in Table 2. As expected, all cross-links in the monomer sample showed the two mass peak pattern described in Fig. 1 and exemplified in Fig. 4 (c and d, blue), indicating intramolecular span. The dimer sample (green) contained a mixture of intra- and intermolecular cross-links (the four-peak pattern). 13 of the identified cross-links were shared between monomer and dimer. Monomeric apoA-IΔ185–243 had 9 unique cross-links, whereas dimeric apoA-IΔ185–243 had 7 unique cross-links. This indicates that the dimer and monomer structures are related, but not identical. There were several examples of cross-links that were intramolecular in the monomer, but intermolecular in the dimer, despite linking the same Lys or Ser residues. This is a signature of a domain swap model of oligomerization.TABLE 1Identified INTRA-peptide BS3 cross-links in isolated lipid-free apoA-IΔ185–243 monomeric and dimeric samples derived from mixed 14N- and 15N-labeled proteinsMasscExperimentally derived monoisotopic mass for each peptide with each isotope and the combinations.Cross-linkPeptides involvedaLysines or serines involved in cross-links are in bold type.Mod.bMod., chemical modifications; XL, one complete cross-link (+138.068 Da); H, one hydrolyzed cross-linker (+156.079 Da).Sample14N15NDaLys88–Lys9484QEMSKDLEEVKAK96XLM1671.861688.81XLD1671.861688.81Lys12–Lys2311VKDLATVYVDVLKDSGR27XLM2015.132037.07XLD2015.122037.06Lys23–Ser2511VKDLATVYVDVLKDSGR27XL, HM2171.222193.16XL, HD2171.212193.15Lys133–Lys140132QKLHELQEKLSPLGEEMR149XLM2302.242329.16XLD2302.232329.15Lys133–Ser142132QKLHELQEKLSPLGEEMR149XLM2302.242329.16DNDdND, not detected.

These effectors subvert host cell signaling pathways to ensure bacterial proliferation. Despite their importance for pathogenesis, the roles of most of the effectors are yet to be characterized. Key to understanding the function of effectors is the identification of host proteins they bind during infection. We previously developed a novel tandem-affinity purification (TAP) approach using hexahistidine and BirA-specific biotinylation tags for isolating translocated effector complexes from infected cells whose composition were subsequently deciphered by mass spectrometry. Here we further advanced the workflow for the TAP approach and determined the infection-dependent interactomes of the effectors SidM and LidA, which were previously reported to promiscuously bind multiple Rab GTPases in vitro. In this study we defined a stringent subset of Rab GTPases targeted by SidM and LidA during infection, comprising of Rab1A, 1B, 6, and 10; in addition, LidA targets Rab14 and 18. Taken together, this study illustrates the power of this approach to profile the intracellular interactomes of bacterial effectors during infection.

Taken together, this study illustrates the power of this approach to profile the intracellular interactomes of bacterial effectors during infection. Many bacterial pathogens use secretion systems to translocate virulence factors, termed effectors, into the host cell where they subvert cell signaling to facilitate bacterial survival and proliferation (1Hayes C.S. Aoki S.K. Low D.A. Bacterial contact-dependent delivery systems.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2010; 44: 71-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Understanding the function of the effectors is central for understanding pathogenesis. However, prediction of effector functions using bioinformatics is of limited effectiveness as many effectors share little to no homology with known proteins. Therefore, key to deciphering effector function is the identification of the proteins they target during infection. Legionella pneumophila, a Gram-negative pathogen, is the causative agent of Legionnaire's disease, a severe and potentially fatal pneumonia. Following entry into alveolar macrophages and epithelial cells, Legionella avoids lysosomal degradation and forms a replicative niche, the Legionella containing vacuole (LCV) 4The abbreviations used are: LCV, Legionella containing vacuole; T4SS, type IV secretion system; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PI4P, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate; TAP, tandem-affinity purification; LC-MS/MS, liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry; SAP, single-affinity purification; MS, mass spectrometry; ID, identification.

The defect in organelle trafficking/intracellular multiplication (Dot/Icm) type IV secretion system (T4SS), which translocates over 300 mostly uncharacterized effectors, is essential for Legionella's ability to survive and replicate intracellularly (3Berger K.H.

Central to the Legionella virulence strategy is its ability to manipulate the function of multiple Rab GTPases, which are important regulators of vesicular trafficking. Proteomic analysis of the LCV has shown that a large number of Rab GTPases (Rab1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 14, 18, 21, 31, and 32) are recruited to the LCV (7Hoffmann C. Finsel I. Otto A.

Microbiol. 2014; 16: 1034-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In particular, manipulation of Rab1, involved in trafficking between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi, has been elucidated in great detail. Critical to the manipulation of Rab1 is the effector SidM (DrrA), which contains three functional domains. Upon translocation, it anchors via a phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) binding domain onto the LCV (8Brombacher E. Urwyler S. Ragaz C. Weber S.S. Kami K. Overduin M. Hilbi H. Rab1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor SidM is a major phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate-binding effector protein of Legionella pneumophila.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 4846-4856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), where it recruits and activates Rab1 using its guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) domain (9Machner M.P. Isberg R.R. A bifunctional bacterial protein links GDI displacement to Rab1 activation.Science. 2007; 318: 974-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). SidM's adenylyltransferase domain modifies GTP-bound Rab1 with an AMP moiety (10Müller M.P. Peters H. Blümer J. Blankenfeldt W. Goody R.S. Itzen A. The Legionella effector protein DrrA AMPylates the membrane traffic regulator Rab1b.Science. 2010; 329: 946-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), which locks Rab1 into a constitutively active state and prevents deactivation by the effector GTPase activating protein (GAP) LepB (11Ingmundson A. Delprato A. Lambright D.G. Roy C.R. Legionella pneumophila proteins that regulate Rab1 membrane cycling.Nature. 2007; 450: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) until removal of the AMP group by the effector SidD (12Neunuebel M.R. Chen Y. Gaspar A.H. Backlund Jr., P.S. Yergey A. Machner M.P.

Legionella pneumophila SidD is a deAMPylase that modifies Rab1.Nature. 2011; 475: 506-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In addition, the effector LidA was implicated in Rab1 recruitment to the LCV (14Machner M.P. Isberg R.R. Targeting of host Rab GTPase function by the intravacuolar pathogen Legionella pneumophila.Dev. Cell. 2006; 11: 47-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar); however, its precise function is currently unknown. Besides the well characterized interactions with Rab1, in vitro binding assays have shown that SidM can bind Rab8B, 10, 27A/B, 31, 35 while LidA can bind Rab2, 3B, 4B, 5, 6, 7, 8A/B, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 18, 20, 22, 27A/B, 30, 31, 32, and 35 (15Cheng W. Yin K. Lu D. Li B. Zhu D. Chen Y. Zhang H. Xu S. Chai J. Gu L.

Proteome Res. 2015; 14: 1920-1936Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In particular, LidA binds Rab1, 6, and 8 with picomolar affinities in vitro (17Schoebel S. Cichy A.L. Goody R.S. Itzen A. Protein LidA from Legionella is a Rab GTPase supereffector.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 17945-17950Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This shows promiscuous Rab GTPase binding capacity of the two effectors; however, the selective distribution of Rab GTPases to specific subcellular compartments as well as the predominant localization of SidM and LidA on the LCV suggest that their interactions during infection might be governed by spatial mobility constraints. It is currently unknown which of these reported effector-Rab GTPase interactions are relevant during infection. We have recently developed a novel method to isolate intracellular effector protein complexes during infection of cultured cells (18Mousnier A. Schroeder G.N. Stoneham C.A. So E.C. Garnett J.A. Yu L. Matthews S.J. Choudhary J.S. Hartland E.L. Frankel G. A new method to determine in vivo interactomes reveals binding of the Legionella pneumophila effector PieE to multiple rab GTPases.mBio. 2014; 5: e01148Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), enabling us to overcome the common pitfalls of in vitro assays which often deliver false-positives or miss interactors as they do not account for the unique microenvironment found in infected cells. In this assay, Legionella expressing an effector of interest fused to a hexahistidine (His6)-tag and a 15 amino acid residue BirA biotinylation site (Bio) infect host cells stably expressing BirA, the Escherichia coli biotin ligase. Provision of BirA only in the host cell allows enhanced discrimination of translocated effector from the remaining intrabacterial pool, enabling the reduction of bacterial background binders. In addition, as both affinity tags are small and inert to detergents and denaturing chemicals, the system allows the use of a wide range of effective lysis and purification conditions. Formaldehyde crosslinking prior to cell lysis allows protein-protein interactions to be stabilized. Tandem affinity purification (TAP) of effector complexes formed in infected cells using Ni2+ nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) and streptavidin affinity purification permits the composition of effector complexes to be determined using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). We first successfully employed the technique to study the transmembrane effector PieE and showed that it forms a multi-domain Rab GTPase binding hub on the LCV during infection. The aim of this project was to use optimized effector complex purification protocols and semi-quantitative proteomics to determine which Rab GTPases are targeted by SidM and LidA in infected cells. Bacterial strains used in this study are shown in Supplemental Table S1. Plasmids were constructed using standard molecular biology techniques with primers and restriction enzymes indicated in Supplemental Table S2. Chromosomal DNA from L. pneumophila strain 130b (ATCC BAA-74) served as template. GFP-Rab2a, -Rab5c, and -Rab10 were amplified from pENTR-Rab GTPase constructs as templates. GFP-BirA was amplified from pICC1394 as template (18Mousnier A. Schroeder G.N. Stoneham C.A. So E.C. Garnett J.A. Yu L. Matthews S.J. Choudhary J.S. Hartland E.L. Frankel G.

Sequence identities of the constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. HEK293E, A549, A549-BirA (18Mousnier A. Schroeder G.N. Stoneham C.A. So E.C. Garnett J.A. Yu L. Matthews S.J. Choudhary J.S.

THP-1 and THP-1-BirA cells were grown in RPMI (Sigma) supplemented with 10% FCS and 1% GlutaMAX. All cells were cultured under a humidified atmosphere (5% CO2, 37 °C). A549 and THP-1 cells were virally transduced as described previously (19Schroeder G.N. Aurass P. Oates C.V. Tate E.W. Hartland E.L. Flieger A. Frankel G. Legionella pneumophila effector LpdA is a palmitoylated phospholipase D virulence factor.Infect. Immun. 2015; 83: 3989-4002Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Briefly, a solution of pMXs-IP containing a GFP-Rab or GFP-BirA, pCMV-VSV-G envelope and pCMV-MMLV-gag-pol packaging plasmids was transfected into HEK293E cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After 24 h, the medium was replaced and left for a further 24 h. The supernatant was collected, sterile filtered (0.45 μm) and added to cultured A549 or THP-1 cells. The A549 and THP-1 cells were selected with puromycin (Gibco) (1.5 μg/ml and 2 μg/ml, respectively) for at least 24 h and viable cells maintained in culture as described above. Transduced cells were sorted by flow cytometry to obtain a fluorescently homogenous population. L. pneumophila strain 130b (ATCC BAA-74) was grown as described previously (20Schroeder G.N. Petty N.K.

Bacteriol. 2010; 192: 6001-6016Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). For infection, bacteria grown for 3 days on buffered charcoal yeast extract (CYE) agar plates were resuspended to a starting OD of 0.1 in N-(2-acetamido)-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid (ACES)-buffered yeast extract (AYE) broth and incubated at 37 °C for 21 h. Chloramphenicol (Cm) was used at 6 μg/ml as required. Expression of tagged effectors was induced at 20 h post inoculation by addition of 1 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 1 h. A549-BirA cells were seeded at 4 × 106 cells per 10-cm Petri dish for 14 h. THP-1-BirA cells were seeded at 1 × 107 cells per 10 cm Petri dish and differentiation induced by addition of 80 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) for 3 days. Prior to infection, 4 μm biotin (Sigma), 6 μg/ml Cm and 1 mm IPTG were added to the medium. A549-BirA and THP-1-BirA were infected with L. pneumophila strains at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 15 and 1 respectively. Cells were washed 2 h post-infection with 3 × 5 ml PBS and fresh medium (supplemented with 1% GlutaMAX, 10% FCS, 4 μm biotin, 6 μg/ml Cm, 1 mm IPTG) added and incubated for another 22 h (A549-BirA) or 4 h (THP-1-BirA). Isolation of effector complexes was adapted from Mousnier et al. (18Mousnier A. Schroeder G.N. Stoneham C.A. So E.C. Garnett J.A. Yu L. Matthews S.J. Choudhary J.S. Hartland E.L. Frankel G. A new method to determine in vivo interactomes reveals binding of the Legionella pneumophila effector PieE to multiple rab GTPases.mBio. 2014; 5: e01148Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). All effector complex isolation experiments were performed in technical triplicate (SAP/TAP, THP-1, lysis buffers, formaldehyde concentrations, and LidA experiments) or biological duplicate of technical duplicates (crosslinker reactivity experiment). Composition of all buffers are shown in Supplemental Tables S3 and S4. All steps were performed at the lysis buffer dependent temperature indicated in Supplemental Table S4 unless otherwise stated. 6/24 h infected cells were washed with 2 × 5 ml PBS, fixed using 5-ml crosslinking solution for 30 min at room temperature and quenched by addition of 500 μl of 1.25 m glycine/50 mm l-cysteine in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were washed with 3 × 5 ml PBS and lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer with protease inhibitors (Roche) and Benzonase (Novagen) for 30 min. Cells were scraped and insoluble fraction removed by centrifugation for 20 min at 20,000 × g. The soluble fraction was added to pre-equilibrated Ni2+-NTA (Qiagen) (60 μl of 50% slurry per sample) and incubated for 1 h on a rotating wheel. The resin was washed 5 × 1 ml His wash buffer with 1000 × g 1 min spin at 4 °C in between. Bound complexes were eluted using 3 × 200 μl elution buffer (10 min on vortex shaker and 1000 × g 1 min spin at 4 °C to pellet the resin). Elution fractions were combined, centrifuged at 20000 × g for 1 min at 4 °C, transferred to pre-equilibrated Neutravidin agarose (Pierce) (50 μl of 50% slurry per sample) and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h on a rotating wheel. The resin was washed with 4 × 1 ml Triton lysis buffer and 4 × 1 ml 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate (AMBIC). 50 μl of AMBIC was left over the resin after the final wash. Sequencing grade modified trypsin (1 μg) (Promega) was added to each sample and incubated at 37 °C overnight. Supernatants containing tryptic peptides were collected by addition of 1 × 80 μl AMBIC and 1 × 80 μl of 0.1% formic acid with 10 min vortex shaking and 3000 × g 2 min centrifugation. Peptide mixtures were desalted by Stage-Tip method as described previously (21Broncel M. Serwa R.A. Ciepla P. Krause E. Dallman M.J. Magee A.I. Tate E.W. Multifunctional reagents for quantitative proteome-wide analysis of protein modification in human cells and dynamic profiling of protein lipidation during vertebrate development.Angewandte Chemie. 2015; 54: 5948-5951Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and dimethyl labeled according to Boersema et al. (22Boersema P.J. Raijmakers R. Lemeer S. Mohammed S. Heck A.J. Multiplex peptide stable isotope dimethyl labeling for quantitative proteomics.Nature Protocols. 2009; 4: 484-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). Bio and K/A samples were light and heavy dimethyl labeled, respectively. Briefly, peptide mixtures were loaded onto sorbent (SDB-XC poly(styrenedivinylbenzene) copolymer, from 3 m) and desalted with 150 μl of water. 100 μl of dimethyl labeling solution (Supplemental Table S5) were passed through the Stage-Tip over 30 min. The membrane was washed with 150 μl of water and peptides eluted using 79% acetonitrile. Samples were vacuum dried and stored at −80 °C. Samples were resuspended in 20 μl of 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid, 2% acetonitrile, and transferred into LC-MS sample vials. The analysis was performed using an Acclaim PepMap RSLC column of 50 cm × 75 μm inner diameter (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using a 2 h acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% aqueous formic acid at a flow rate of 250 nl/min. Easy nLC-1000 was coupled to a Q Exactive mass spectrometer via an easy-spray source (all Thermo Fisher Scientific). The Q Exactive was operated in data-dependent mode with survey scans acquired at a resolution of 75,000 at m/z 200 (transient time 256 ms). Up to ten of the most abundant isotope patterns with charge +2 or higher from the survey scan were selected with an isolation window of 3.0 m/z and fragmented by higher-energy collisional dissociation with normalized collision energies of 25. The maximum ion injection times for the survey scan and the MS/MS scans (acquired with a resolution of 17,500 at m/z 200) were 20 and 120 ms, respectively. The ion target value for MS was set to 106 and for MS/MS to 105, and the intensity threshold was set to 8.3 × 102. The data were processed using MaxQuant (version 1.5.0.25) (23Cox J. Mann M. MaxQuant enables high peptide identification rates, individualized p.p.b.-range mass accuracies and proteome-wide protein quantification.Nature Biotechnol. 2008; 26: 1367-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (9150) Google Scholar) and peptides were identified by matching MS/MS spectra with reference human (Uniprot, downloaded on 19/01/2015) and L. pneumophila strain 130b (ORF extraction of draft genome, Schroeder et al., ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/pathogens/Legionella/pneumophila/130b/ (20Schroeder G.N.

Andromeda: a peptide search engine integrated into the MaxQuant environment.J. Proteome Res. 2011; 10: 1794-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (3448) Google Scholar). N-terminal acetylation and methionine oxidation were selected as variable modifications. No fixed modifications were set. Reference proteomes were in silico digested using the trypsin/P setting whereby cleavages were allowed after arginine/lysine residues but only if it is not followed by a proline. Light (+28 Da) and heavy (+32 Da) dimethyl labeled lysines and N termini were used for quantification by a built-in algorithm in MaxQuant (23Cox J. Mann M. MaxQuant enables high peptide identification rates, individualized p.p.b.-range mass accuracies and proteome-wide protein quantification.Nature Biotechnol. 2008; 26: 1367-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (9150) Google Scholar). Up to two missed cleavages were allowed. The false discovery rate was set to 0.01 for peptides, proteins, and sites. All other parameters were as pre-set for the software. The data were further processed using Perseus (Version 1.5.0.9). Samples from the same cell line were processed together. Reverse and identified by site hits were removed. Proteins identified with at least 1 unique and 1 razor peptide were included for further analysis. MS/MS spectra of proteins identified by a single unique peptide are shown in Supplementary MS Spectra. Light (Bio) and heavy (K/A) intensities were logarithmized (log2). Replicates were grouped together and at least two valid values across three (SAP/TAP, THP-1, lysis buffers, formaldehyde concentrations and LidA experiments) or four (crosslinker reactivity experiment) replicates were required for at least one group as a threshold for a positive protein identification. No unique peptide threshold was applied per sample to identify as many potential interactors as possible and not exclude proteins prematurely. Missing log2 intensity values were imputed using a downshifted normal distribution (1.8 downshift, 0.3 width) for each sample individually as an estimate of the detection limit of intensity for each sample. Enrichment factors (the difference in average log2 intensity between Bio and K/A samples) were calculated using imputed values if required. Proteins were ranked according to this enrichment factor for each experiment, resulting in Top10 ranked enriched proteins. Heat maps were generated using log2 light and heavy intensities with imputed values removed. Proteins were classified into five possible categories: Bio-specific (protein is only identified in the Bio sample), Bio enriched (enrichment factor ≥2), nonspecific (-2≤enrichment factor≤2), K/A enriched (enrichment factor ≤-2) and K/A-specific (protein is only identified in the K/A sample). These 5 categories were combined into two broader groups: interactors (Bio specific and Bio enriched) and non-interacting proteins (nonspecific, K/A-enriched, and K/A-specific). MS tables are found in Supplementary MS Tables. The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD003573. A549-GFP-Rab2a/5c/10 cells were seeded and infected as described above. Cells were washed with 3 × 5 ml of PBS and 1 ml of Triton lysis buffer (with protease inhibitors and Benzonase) added. The cells were allowed to lyse at 4 °C for 30 min and scraped into 1.5-ml tubes. Insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation (20,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C). Protein G-coupled Dynabeads (Thermo Fisher) were coated with mouse anti-GFP antibodies (Abcam, ab1218). Soluble cell lysate was cleared using uncoated protein G-coupled Dynabeads for 15 min, 4 °C. The cleared lysate was added to the coated beads and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed with 1× Triton lysis buffer, 1× PBS/0.5% Triton X-100, 1× PBS/0.05% Tween20, 1 × 20 mm Tris/200 mm NaCl, and 1× PBS with 5-min incubations between each wash. Proteins on the beads were eluted by addition of 30 μl of 1× Laemmli buffer and boiling for 5 min. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto PVDF membrane for Western blot analysis. Membranes were blocked in 5% milk in PBS 0.1% Tween20. Primary antibodies (rabbit anti-GFP (1:2000, Abcam, ab290) and mouse anti-HA-HRP (1:4000, Sigma, H6533)) were added for 1 h at room temperature, the membranes washed 3 × 5 min with PBS 0.1% Tween 20 and secondary antibody (anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (1:10000, Jackson Immunoresearch, 111–035-008)) added for 1 h at room temperature if required. Western blots were visualized using EZ-ECL and a Fuji LAS3000 imager. To identify the SidM binding partners during infection, A549 or THP-1 cells expressing BirA (A549-BirA and THP-1-BirA) were infected with L. pneumophila 130b expressing His6-Bio-SidM (Bio-SidM) (Fig. 1). L. pneumophila expressing His6-Bio K/A-tagged SidM (K/A-SidM), which lacks the lysine in the biotinylation site, was used as a negative control. While A549-BirA cells were infected for 24 h, due to L. pneumophila-induced cytotoxicity, the THP-1-BirA cells could only be infected for 6 h. Infected cells were crosslinked with 1% formaldehyde, lysed in phosphate buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and SidM complexes were isolated either by a Neutravidin single-affinity purification (SAP) or a Ni2+-NTA/Neutravidin tandem-affinity purification (TAP) and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Protein enrichment was calculated as the difference in average log2 intensity across replicates between Bio- and K/A-SidM samples. Proteins either exclusively found in the Bio-sample or had an enrichment factor ≥2 were considered SidM interaction partners. All other proteins were classified as unspecific background. The bait protein SidM was identified in Bio-SidM samples from both A549 and THP-1 cells. However, while SidM was detected with the highest log2 intensity of 34 in A549 Bio-SidM samples (both SAP and TAP) (Fig. 2, A and B) and was the most enriched protein (enrichment factor of 13) (Fig. 2C), its intensity from THP-1 cells was ∼30-fold lower and its enrichment factor 3 units lower (Supplemental Fig. S1 and Supplementary MS tables). In addition to lower SidM intensities, the THP-1 samples yielded fewer proteins which were classified as interactors (Supplemental Fig. S1A). As THP-1 samples approached the limit of detection and A549 samples provided more analyzable data, all subsequent experiments were performed using A549-BirA cells. However, although not many interactors were detected for THP-1 samples, Rab1A was found under both SAP and TAP conditions (Supplemental Fig. 1B). In A549-BirA samples, SAP identified 147 proteins, although only 20 of these (13.6%) passed the selection criteria as interaction partners. Of the 83 TAP identified proteins, 38 were classed as interaction partners (45.8%); 15 of these interactors were shared between SAP and TAP (Fig. 2C). Enrichment factors of these common interactors were higher in TAP conditions than SAP conditions. Importantly, eight common targets were found in the Top10 ranked enriched proteins for both SAP and TAP (Fig. 2D). Multiple Rab GTPases, including 1A, 1B, 6, and 10, were detected within the Top10 ranked enriched proteins under both SAP and TAP (Fig. 2B), while Rab2, 8A, and 14 were ranked lower. Detection of the known physiologically relevant SidM binding partners Rab1A and 1B validated the BirA/Bio-tag system. In addition to the Rab GTPases, annexin A1 and ubiquitin were consistently found among the Top10 SidM targets. Along with host proteins, the T4SS Legionella effectors Lpw_31531 (MavP), Lpw_17241 (PpeB), and Lpw_25181 (Lpg2327) were identified as interactors of SidM (Fig. 2B and Supplementary MS Tables). MavP and PpeB were ranked within the Top10 for SAP while only MavP was a Top10 hit for TAP. As TAP reduced unspecific background binders while facilitating identification of interactors, it was used for all subsequent experiments. To determine the effects of different lysis conditions on proteome solubilization and protein identification, we compared lysis buffers containing either 1% Triton X-100 and 6 m guanidinium chloride (GnCl/Triton) or buffers with 1% Triton X-100 (Triton), 1% 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl"
https://openalex.org/W2239603724,"The amount of drug-loaded lipiodol in an HCC tumor post-transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) correlates with the risk of local tumor recurrence. Lipiodol enhancement of a tumor on conventional CT, measured in Hounsfield units (HU), can predict tumor response. Here we investigate whether cone-beam CT (CBCT) can also be used to predict tumor response, providing the benefit of being able to optimize the patient's treatment plan intra-procedurally.A total of 82 HCC nodules (82 patients), ≤5 cm in diameter, were treated with balloon-occluded TACE using miriplatin between December 2013 and November 2014. For each patient, both CBCT and conventional CT images were obtained post-TACE. The degree of correlation between CBCT and conventional CT was determined by comparing identical regions of interest for each imaging modality using pixel values.The pixel values from conventional CT and CBCT were highly correlated, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.912 (p<0.001). The location of the nodules within the liver did not affect the results; the correlation coefficient was 0.891 (p<0.001) for the left lobe and 0.926 (p<0.001) for the right lobe. The mean pixel value for conventional CT was 439 ± 279 HU, and the mean pixel value for CBCT was 416 ± 311 HU.CBCT may be used as a substitute for conventional CT to quantitatively evaluate the amount of drug-loaded lipiodol within an HCC nodule and, hence, the efficacy of TACE treatment. The major benefit of using CBCT is the ability to predict the likelihood of local recurrence intra-procedurally, enabling subsequent treatment optimization."
https://openalex.org/W2236135371,"In the Carbohydrate-Active Enzyme (CAZy) database, glycoside hydrolase family 5 (GH5) is a large family with more than 6,000 sequences. Among the 51 described GH5 subfamilies, subfamily GH5_26 contains members that display either endo-β(1,4)-glucanase or β(1,3;1,4)-glucanase activities. In this study, we focused on the GH5_26 enzyme from Saccharophagus degradans (SdGluc5_26A), a marine bacterium known for its capacity to degrade a wide diversity of complex polysaccharides. SdGluc5_26A displays lichenase activity toward β(1,3;1,4)-glucans with a side cellobiohydrolase activity toward β(1,4)-glucans.

The N-terminal region of SdGluc5_26A protrudes into the active site of an adjacent monomer. To understand whether this occupation of the active site could influence its activity, we conducted a comprehensive enzymatic characterization of SdGluc5_26A and of a mutant truncated at the N terminus. Ligand complex structures and kinetic analyses reveal that the N terminus governs the substrate specificity of SdGluc5_26A. Its deletion opens the enzyme cleft at the −3 subsite and turns the enzyme into an endo-β(1,4)-glucanase.

Unique aspects of the grass cell wall.Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2008; 11: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). The composition of β(1,3;1,4)-glucans varies according to the plant botanical origin and growth conditions. They consist of unbranched and unsubstituted chains of β(1,3)- and β(1,4)-linked glucosyl residues. The ratio of β(1,4)/(1,3)-glucosyl residues influences the physicochemical properties of the polysaccharide and therefore its functional properties in cell walls (2.Burton R.A. Fincher G.B.

The enzymatic breakdown of β(1,3;1,4)-glucans is catalyzed by classical β(1,4)-glucanases (EC 3.2.1.4) and β(1,3;1,4)-glucanases (EC 3.2.1.73), also known as lichenases. The β(1,3;1,4)-glucanases specifically cleave β(1,4)-linkages adjacent to β(1,3)-bonds (3.Planas A. Bacterial 1,3–1,4-β-glucanases: structure, function and protein engineering.Biochim. Biophys.

To date, with more than 6,600 available sequences in the CAZy database, family GH5 is one of the largest. Enzymes in this family are retaining glycoside hydrolases that operate via a classical Koshland double-displacement mechanism (5.Barras F. Bortoli-German I. Bauzan M. Rouvier J. Gey C. Heyraud A. Henrissat B. Stereochemistry of the hydrolysis reaction catalyzed by endoglucanase Z from Erwinia chrysanthemi.FEBS Lett. 1992; 300: 145-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The first crystallographic structure of the GH5 family was solved in 1995 (6.Dominguez R. Souchon H. Spinelli S. Dauter Z. Wilson K.S. Chauvaux S. Béguin P. Alzari P.M. A common protein fold and similar active site in two distinct families of β-glycanases.Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 569-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). It revealed a (β/α)8 barrel found in other GH families that belong to the structural clan GH-A. Even if enzymes from family GH5 are predicted to be mainly involved in plant cell wall degradation, assignment of enzyme specificity is still complex. Indeed, up to 20 different activities have been reported for this large family (7.Aspeborg H. Coutinho P.M. Wang Y. Brumer 3rd, H. Henrissat B. Evolution, substrate specificity and subfamily classification of glycoside hydrolase family 5 (GH5).BMC Evol. Biol. 2012; 12: 186Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Recently, a subdivision into 51 subfamilies has been implemented to improve correspondence between specificity and sequence (7.Aspeborg H. Coutinho P.M. Wang Y. Brumer 3rd, H. Henrissat B. Evolution, substrate specificity and subfamily classification of glycoside hydrolase family 5 (GH5).BMC Evol. Biol. 2012; 12: 186Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). In this work, we present a detailed structural and enzymatic characterization of one of the GH5 enzymes encoded by Saccharophagus degradans 2-40 (Sde2-40), named SdGluc5_26A (formerly Cel5F) (8.Watson B.J. Zhang H. Longmire A.G. Moon Y.H. Hutcheson S.W. Processive endoglucanases mediate degradation of cellulose by Saccharophagus degradans.J.

Sde2-40 is a marine bacterium known mainly for its capacity to degrade different polysaccharides including agar, cellulose, and chitin (9.Hutcheson S.W. Zhang H. Suvorov M. Carbohydrase systems of Saccharophagus degradans degrading marine complex polysaccharides.Mar. Drugs. 2011; 9: 645-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The genome analysis of Sde2-40 revealed 139 GHs including 19 in family GH5 (10.Weiner R.M. Taylor 2nd, L.E. Henrissat B. Hauser L. Land M. Coutinho P.M. Rancurel C. Saunders E.H. Longmire A.G.

Herein, we show that SdGluc5_26A is a lichenase with β(1,3;1,4)-glucanase and side cellobiohydrolase activity. By using structural and enzymatic characterization as well as mutational analyses, we found that the substrate specificity of SdGluc5_26A relies on its quaternary structure. SdGluc5_26A was amplified by PCR using Pfx polymerase (Invitrogen, Saint-Aubin, France) and Sde2-40 genomic DNA as template. Forward and reverse primers were designed to use the Gateway® PCR cloning technology (Life Technologies). Primers used for the wild-type cloning were: forward 5′-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTTAGAAAACCTGTACTTCCAGGGTGCAAATAACAGCGCCCCA-3′, reverse 5′-GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTCTTATTAGCGTTTTTTAGCTTCTAGCATAACC-3′ (italic letters indicate the sequence needed for the Gateway cloning protocol). The amplified PCR product was inserted into the pDESTTM17 vector. The encoding native signal peptide was eliminated in the construction. The same protocol with a different reverse primer was applied to clone the mutant SdGluc5_26AΔS38 (5′-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTTAGAAAACCTGTACTTCCAGGGTAGCCAATTCGATGTAAAAAGC-3′). The E291Q mutation was performed using the QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit following the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene, Santa Clara, CA). The primers used were: forward 5′-CCTGTAATAGCAACACAGCTAGGCTGGGTACAAC-3′ and reverse 5′-GTTGTACCCAGCCTAGCTGTGTTGCTATTACAGG-3′ (the mutated codon for the punctual mutation is underlined). All the constructs were produced and purified by following the same protocols. Recombinant proteins were produced in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) pLysS cells. ZYP5052 medium was chosen for bacterial growth (15.Studier F.W. Protein production by auto-induction in high density shaking cultures.Protein Expr. Purif. 2005; 41: 207-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (4121) Google Scholar). After 3 h at 37 °C to reach exponential growth phase, the temperature was reduced to 17 °C for an overnight protein production. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4,000 × g during 10 min, and the pellet was stored at −80 °C until purification. Cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF, 0.25 mg−1 ml−1 DNase, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.25 mg−1 ml−1 lysozyme) and then sonicated at 4 °C (sonicated for 30 s three times, interspaced by 1-min breaks). The crude extract was centrifuged (11,000 × g during 30 min at 4 °C), and the supernatant was loaded onto a pre-equilibrated HisTrapTM 5-ml column (GE Healthcare Life Science, Vélizy-Villacoublay, France). The column was washed first with buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, and 50 mm imidazole) and then washed a second time by adding 10% buffer B (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, and 500 mm imidazole). Finally, the protein was eluted with 50% buffer B. The eluted fractions were pooled and injected onto a HiLoadTM 26/60 SuperdexTM 200 column (GE Healthcare Life Science). Size-exclusion chromatography was performed with buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 300 mm NaCl. SdGluc5_26A was concentrated with centrifugal filter units (30-kDa cut off, Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) to reach the concentration of 13 mg−1 ml−1 used for crystallization trials. Selenomethionine-labeled protein was produced in M9 minimum medium with selenomethionine and amino acids known to inhibit the pathway of methionine biosynthesis (16.Doublié S. Preparation of selenomethionyl proteins for phase determination.Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). After 3 h at 37 °C, the culture turbidity was checked by measuring absorbance at 600 nm. When the exponential growth phase was reached (A600 = 0.6), protein production was induced by adding 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and the temperature was decreased to 17 °C for overnight growth. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4,000 × g during 10 min, and the pellet was stored at −80 °C until purification. The purification protocol was the same as for SdGluc5_26A. The protein concentration was determined using a Thermo Scientific NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Illkirch, France) by measuring absorbance at 280 nm. The oligomerization state was confirmed by performing size-exclusion chromatography coupled with multi-angle laser light scattering (SEC-MALLS, Wyatt technology, Santa Barbara, CA) experiments. For this purpose, 100 μl of enzyme at 5 mg−1 ml−1 were dialyzed overnight in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, and 300 mm NaCl. After overnight equilibration of the column (ShodexTM column KW803), 30 μl of sample were injected. The elution was carried out during 47 min at a flow rate of 0.5 ml−1 min−1. Results were analyzed by the ASTRA software (Wyatt Technology). The oligomeric state stability of SdGH5_26A and SdGH5_26AΔS38 mutant was verified by size-exclusion chromatography on a 26/60 S200 column. The peak corresponding to the monomer was further injected onto a 10/30 SuperdexTM 200 column (GE Healthcare Life Science), eluted, and concentrated in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 300 mm NaCl. Crystallization trials were performed using the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method using a mosquito®Crystal (TTP Labtech) crystallization robot and a protein concentration of 13 mg−1 ml−1. Cubic and bipyramidal shaped crystals were obtained in several conditions arising from various commercial screening kits. Finally, the best diffracting crystals of native SdGluc5_26A were obtained in the presence of 0.2 m ammonium sulfate, 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 6.0, and 25% (w/v) PEG 8000. The crystals belong to cubic space group P4132 with average unit cell axes of 143 Å and one molecule per asymmetric unit. Crystals of selenomethionine-labeled protein were obtained from 25% (w/v) PEG 3350, 0.2 m MgCl2, and 0.1 m Bis-Tris buffer, pH 6.5. These crystals belong to space group P41212 with unit cell dimensions 143 × 143 × 136 Å and three molecules per asymmetric unit. Crystals of SdGluc5_26A-E291Q used for substrate soaking were grown in the same conditions as the native enzyme, and soaking was performed by the addition of small amounts of powder of G4, G4A, or G4B to the crystallization droplet, followed by incubation for approximately 1 h. For co-crystallization experiments, SdGluc5_26A-E291Q was mixed with 15 mm (final concentration) of G4A, and the best diffracting crystals where obtained from 30% (w/v) PEG 4000, 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, and 0.2 m MgCl2. These crystals belong to space group P21 with unit cell parameters 72 × 60 × 130 Å, β = 104° and three molecules per asymmetric unit. A second crystal form in space group C2 and unit cell dimension of 188 × 132 × 131 Å, β = 134° was obtained in the same crystallization condition. All crystals were cryo-protected with mother liquor containing 25% (v/v) glycerol prior to flash-cooling in liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction data for all crystals were collected on beamline Proxima1 at the Synchrotron SOLEIL (Gif-sur-Yvette, France). Diffraction data were indexed with XDS (17.Kabsch W.

Sheldrick G.M. Substructure solution with SHELXD.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

The substrate specificities of purified recombinant SdGluc5_26A, SdGluc5_26AΔS38, and SdGluc5_26A-E291Q were evaluated using the following complex substrates at 5 mg−1 ml−1 in McIlvaine's buffer (100 mm citric acid and 200 mm sodium phosphate), pH 7.0.

Unless otherwise indicated, assay mixtures contained substrate and suitably diluted enzyme in McIlvaine's buffer, pH 7.0, at 30 °C. Briefly, 20 μl of recombinant enzyme were mixed with 100 μl of polymeric substrate (5 mg−1 ml−1) or oligosaccharides (100 μm). The reaction was stopped by the addition of 120 μl of DNS followed by a 5-min incubation at 100 °C. For HPAEC analysis, the reaction was stopped using 8 m urea. The reaction mixtures were then transferred to a microfiltration plate and centrifuged during 2 min at 1,450 × g, and 20 μl of the mixture were injected. The elution was carried out in 130 mm NaOH using a multi-step linear gradient program as follows. The first step was a 10-min linear gradient from 100% A (130 mm NaOH) to 95% A and 5% B (500 mm NaOAc, 130 mm NaOH). The second step was a 10-min linear gradient from 95% A and 5% B to 85% A and 15% B, and the third step was a 5-min linear gradient from 85% A and 15% B to 83.75% A and 16.25% B. The optimal pH was estimated using lichenan as substrate at a concentration of 10 mg−1 ml−1 in McIlvaine's buffer (pH from 4.0 to 8.0) and in 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH from 8.0 to 10.0). The optimal temperature was estimated at temperatures ranging from 4 to 80 °C. Specific activities and kinetics parameters toward the different complex polysaccharide substrates were measured using the DNS assay as described above. The determination of Michaelis-Menten constants on lichenan, barley β-glucan, and CMC was measured with substrate concentrations ranging from 1 to 20 mg−1 ml−1. All assays were carried out in triplicate. The specific activities are expressed in μmol of sugar released per min per mg of enzyme, whereas the kinetic parameters were estimated using weighted nonlinear squares regression analysis using the GraFit program (Erithacus Software, Horley, UK). Monosaccharides and oligosaccharides generated after hydrolysis by the recombinant enzymes of the different polymeric substrates (lichenan, barley β-glucan, and CMC) and of the different cello-oligosaccharides (G3 to G6) and β(1,3;1,4)-gluco-oligosaccharides (G3A, Glc-β(1,3)-Glc-β(1,4)-Glc-OH; G3B, Glc-β(1,4)-Glc-β(1,3)-Glc-OH; G4A, Glc-β(1,3)-Glc-β(1,4)-Glc-β(1,4)-Glc-OH; G4B, Glc-β(1,4)-Glc-β(1,4)-Glc-β(1,3)-Glc-OH; G4C, Glc-β(1,4)-Glc-β(1,3)-Glc-β(1,4)-Glc-OH) were analyzed by HPAEC as described above. Calibrationcurves were constructed using appropriate standards from which response factors were calculated (Chromeleon program, Dionex) and used to estimate the amount of product released in test incubations. All assays were carried out in triplicate. The specificity constants were calculated using the Matsui equation for oligosaccharides (27.Lafond M. Navarro D. Haon M. Couturier M. Berrin J.G.

Activities toward pNP-substrates (1 mm) were determined by measuring the release of 4-nitrophenol in McIlvaine's buffer, pH 7.0, 30 °C in 100-μl reaction volume. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 200 μl of 1 m sodium carbonate, and the release of 4-nitrophenol was quantified at 405 nm using the molar extinction coefficient of 4-nitrophenol (18,300 m−1 cm−1). One unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of protein that released 1 μmol of glucose per min. The sequence of SdGluc5_26A is composed of a 21-residue-long signal peptide and a catalytic GH5 module comprising 344 residues. The crystal structure of SdGluc5_26A heterologously expressed in E. coli was solved in its native form at 2.05 Å resolution. The polypeptide chain is visible from Asn29 to Lys364 (for data collection and refinement statistics, see Table 2). SdGluc5_26A has the prototypical (β/α)8 fold characteristic of other family GH5 members and of enzymes of clan A, to which GH5 belongs. A narrow and deep cleft ∼30 Å long runs across the surface of the protein near the C termini of the β-strands and hosts the two invariant catalytic glutamate residues presented at the end of β-strands 4 and 7. From similarity to other GH5 enzymes, the catalytic acid-base and the catalytic nucleophile can be assigned to Glu189 and Glu291, respectively. The carboxylate groups of Glu189 and Glu291 are separated by a distance of ∼4.5 Å, in agreement with a double displacement retaining mechanism proceeding via oxocarbenium ion-like transition states (29.Vocadlo D.J. Davies G.J. Mechanistic insights into glycosidase chemistry.Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2008; 12: 539-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). The catalytic role of Glu291 was confirmed by the observation that the E291Q mutant displayed only residual activity based on the DNS assay (less than 100 milliunits−1 mg−1). One glycerol molecule and two ethylene glycol molecules were found to bind within the substrate-binding cleft, close to the catalytic machinery. On the side opposite to the substrate-binding groove, SdGluc5_26A contains an extra lid-like β-hairpin, commonly encountered in GH5 enzymes.

Although sake is reported to have beneficial health effects, it is not known whether chronic sake consumption modulates health risks due to radiation exposure or other factors. Here, the effects of chronic administration of sake on radiation-induced metabolic alterations in the livers of mice were evaluated. Sake (junmai-shu) was administered daily to female mice (C3H/He) for one month, and the mice were exposed to fractionated doses of X-rays (0.75 Gy/day) for the last four days of the sake administration period. For comparative analysis, a group of mice were administered 15% (v/v) ethanol in water instead of sake. Metabolites in the liver were analyzed by capillary electrophoresis-time-of-flight mass spectrometry one day following the last exposure to radiation. The metabolite profiles of mice chronically administered sake in combination with radiation showed marked changes in purine, pyrimidine, and glutathione (GSH) metabolism, which were only partially altered by radiation or sake administration alone. Notably, the changes in GSH metabolism were not observed in mice treated with radiation following chronic administration of 15% ethanol in water. Changes in several metabolites, including methionine and valine, were induced by radiation alone, but were not detected in the livers of mice who received chronic administration of sake. In addition, the chronic administration of sake increased the level of serum triglycerides, although radiation exposure suppressed this increase. Taken together, the present findings suggest that chronic sake consumption promotes GSH metabolism and anti-oxidative activities in the liver, and thereby may contribute to minimizing the adverse effects associated with radiation."
https://openalex.org/W2234477526,"The voltage-gated H+ channel (Hv) is a voltage sensor domain-like protein consisting of four transmembrane segments (S1–S4). The native Hv structure is a homodimer, with the two channel subunits functioning cooperatively. Here we show that the two voltage sensor S4 helices within the dimer directly cooperate via a π-stacking interaction between Trp residues at the middle of each segment. Scanning mutagenesis showed that Trp situated around the original position provides the slow gating kinetics characteristic of the dimer's cooperativity. Analyses of the Trp mutation on the dimeric and monomeric channel backgrounds and analyses with tandem channel constructs suggested that the two Trp residues within the dimer are functionally coupled during Hv deactivation but are less so during activation. Molecular dynamics simulation also showed direct π-stacking of the two Trp residues. These results provide new insight into the cooperative function of voltage-gated channels, where adjacent voltage sensor helices make direct physical contact and work as a single unit according to the gating process."
https://openalex.org/W2236581178,"Atonal Homolog 8 (Atoh8) is a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor that is highly conserved across species and expressed in multiple tissues during embryogenesis. In the developing pancreas, Atoh8 is expressed in endocrine progenitors but declines in hormone-positive cells, suggesting a role during early stages of the endocrine differentiation program. We previously generated a whole-body Atoh8 knockout but early lethality of null embryos precluded assessment of Atoh8 functions during organ development. Here we report the generation of a conditional Atoh8 knockout mouse strain by insertion of two loxP sites flanking exon 1 of the Atoh8 gene. Pancreas-specific Atoh8 knockout (Atoh8 Δpanc) mice were obtained by mating this strain with a Pdx1-Cre transgenic line. Atoh8 Δpanc mice were born at the expected mendelian ratio and showed normal appearance and fertility. Pancreas weight and gross pancreatic morphology were normal. All pancreatic cell lineages were present, although endocrine δ (somatostatin) cells were modestly augmented in Atoh8 Δpanc as compared to control neonates. This increase did not affect whole-body glucose tolerance in adult knockout animals. Gene expression analysis in embryonic pancreases at the time of the major endocrine differentiation wave revealed modest alterations in several early endocrine differentiation markers. Together, these data argue that Atoh8 modulates activation of the endocrine program but it is not essential for pancreas formation or endocrine differentiation in the mouse. Given the ubiquitous expression pattern of Atoh8, the availability of a mouse strain carrying a conditional allele for this gene warrants further studies using temporally regulated Cre transgenic lines to elucidate time or cell-autonomous functions of Atoh8 during development and in the adult."

The aims of this study were to identify candidate proteins associated with ES pregnancies from amniotic fluid supernatant (AFS) using proteomics, and to explore the role of biological networks in the pathophysiology of ES.AFS from six second trimester pregnancies with ES fetuses and six normal cases were included in this study. Fluorescence-based two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/MS) were used for comparative proteomic analysis. The identified proteins were further validated by Western blotting and the role of biological networks was analyzed.Twelve protein spots were differentially expressed by more than 1.5-fold in the AFS of the ES pregnancies. MALDI-TOF/MS identified one up-regulated protein: apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1), and four under-regulated proteins: vitamin D binding protein (VDBP), alpha-1-antitrypsin (A1AT), insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 1 (IGFBP-1), and transthyretin (TTR). Western blot and densitometric analysis of ApoA1, A1AT, IGFBP-1, and TTR confirmed the alteration of these proteins in the amniotic fluid samples. Biological network analysis revealed that the proteins of the ES AFS were involved mainly in lipid and hormone metabolism, immune response, and cardiovascular disease.These five proteins may be involved in the pathogenesis of ES.

The rate and effects of mutations that can cause pathoadaptation are key determinants of the pace at which E. coli can colonize such niches and become pathogenic. We used experimental evolution to determine the speed and evolutionary paths undertaken by a commensal strain of E. coli when adapting to intracellular life. We estimated the acquisition of pathoadaptive mutations at a rate of 10-6 per genome per generation, resulting in the fixation of more virulent strains in less than a hundred generations. Whole genome sequencing of independently evolved clones showed that the main targets of intracellular adaptation involved loss of function mutations in genes implicated in the assembly of the lipopolysaccharide core, iron metabolism and di- and tri-peptide transport, namely rfaI, fhuA and tppB, respectively. We found a substantial amount of antagonistic pleiotropy in evolved populations, as well as metabolic trade-offs, commonly found in intracellular bacteria with reduced genome sizes. Overall, the low levels of clonal interference detected indicate that the first steps of the transition of a commensal E. coli into intracellular pathogens are dominated by a few pathoadaptive mutations with very strong effects."

Although multiple disease driving gene aberrations have been identified by gene expression and genomic studies, only a few studies focused at the protein level. We applied 2 dimensional gel electrophoresis to compare seven GC B cell non Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) cell lines with a lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL). An average of 130 spots were at least two folds different in intensity between NHL cell lines and the LCL. We selected approximately 38 protein spots per NHL cell line and linked them to 145 unique spots based on the location in the gel. 34 spots that were found altered in at least three NHL cell lines when compared to LCL, were submitted for LC-MS/MS. This resulted in 28 unique proteins, a substantial proportion of these proteins were involved in cell motility and cell metabolism. Loss of expression of B2M, and gain of expression of PRDX1 and PPIA was confirmed in the cell lines and primary lymphoma tissue. Moreover, inhibition of PPIA with cyclosporine A blocked cell growth of the cell lines, the effect size was associated with the PPIA expression levels. In conclusion, we identified multiple differentially expressed proteins by 2-D proteomics, and showed that some of these proteins might play a role in the pathogenesis of NHL."
https://openalex.org/W2240095357,"The dried body of Mylabris cichorii is well-known Chinese traditional medicine. The sesquiterpenoid cantharidin, which is secreted mostly by adult male beetles, has recently been used as an anti-cancer drug. However, little is known about the mechanisms of cantharidin biosynthesis. Furthermore, there is currently no genomic or transcriptomic information for M. cichorii. In this study, we performed de novo assembly transcriptome of M. cichorii using the Illumina Hiseq2000. A single run produced 9.19 Gb of clean nucleotides comprising 29,247 sequences, including 23,739 annotated sequences (about 81%). We also constructed two expression profile libraries (20–25 day-old adult males and 20–25 day-old adult females) and discovered 2,465 significantly differentially-expressed genes. Putative genes and pathways involved in the biosynthesis of cantharidin were then characterized. We also found that cantharidin biosynthesis in M. cichorii might only occur via the mevalonate (MVA) pathway, not via the methylerythritol 4-phosphate/deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate (MEP/DOXP) pathway or a mixture of these. Besides, we considered that cantharidin biosynthesis might be related to the juvenile hormone (JH) biosynthesis or degradation. The results of transcriptome and expression profiling analysis provide a comprehensive sequence resource for M. cichorii that could facilitate the in-depth study of candidate genes and pathways involved in cantharidin biosynthesis, and may thus help to improve our understanding of the mechanisms of cantharidin biosynthesis in blister beetles."

This shape deformation was derived by entropic interaction between inner particles and GV membrane. Because a part of inner particles became to form an ordered phase in the region neighboring the GV membrane, free volume for the other part of particles increased.

https://openalex.org/W2236557985,"DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification important for cell fate determination and cell type-specific gene expression. Transcriptional regulatory regions of the mammalian genome contain a large number of tissue/cell type-dependent differentially methylated regions (T-DMRs) with DNA methylation patterns crucial for transcription of the corresponding genes. In general, tissues consist of multiple cell types in various proportions, making it difficult to detect T-DMRs of minor cell types in tissues. The present study attempts to detect T-DMRs of minor cell types in tissues by ultra-deep bisulfite sequencing of cell type-restricted genes and to assume proportions of minor cell types based on DNA methylation patterns of sequenced reads. For this purpose, we focused on transcriptionally active hypomethylated alleles (Hypo-alleles), which can be recognized by the high ratio of unmethylated CpGs in each sequenced read (allele). The pituitary gland contains multiple cell types including five hormone-expressing cell types and stem/progenitor cells, each of which is a minor cell type in the pituitary tissue. By ultra-deep sequencing of more than 100 reads for detection of Hypo-alleles in pituitary cell type-specific genes, we identified T-DMRs specific to hormone-expressing cells and stem/progenitor cells and used them to estimate the proportions of each cell type based on the Hypo-allele ratio in pituitary tissue. Therefore, introduction of the novel Hypo-allele concept enabled us to detect T-DMRs of minor cell types with estimation of their proportions in the tissue by ultra-deep bisulfite sequencing."
https://openalex.org/W2237219543,"Background Physicians are considered to be the most informed consumers in the use of medical services since they have more information about diseases or medical technology. However, although plenty of researchers have suggested that different medical seeking behavior exists among physicians, very few empirical studies have been conducted to investigate differences in medical utilization between physicians and the general population. Objective We explored differences in the utilization of healthcare services between physicians and the general population using a population-based dataset. Design A cross-sectional study. Participants Data for this study were sourced from the Taiwan Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2000. We included 1426 physicians and 1426 sex- and age-matched comparison subjects. Methods We used Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests to explore differences in variables of healthcare resource utilization between physicians and comparison subjects. We further used Kruskal-Wallis tests to examine differences in variables of healthcare resource utilization between physician practice location and comparison subjects. Results We found that physicians had significantly fewer outpatient visits (13.2 vs. 15.7, p<0.001) and significantly lower outpatient costs (US$477 vs. US$680, p<0.001) than comparison subjects. Furthermore, physicians had lower total health service costs than comparison subjects (US$643 vs. US$1066, p<0.001). This indicates that the mean total health service costs in the year 2010 was 1.66-fold greater for comparison subjects than for physicians. We also found that there were significant differences in the mean number of outpatient services (p<0.001), outpatient costs (p = 0.001), inpatients costs (p = 0.018), and total costs (p = 0.001) among office-based physicians, hospital-based physicians, and comparison subjects. Specifically, Scheffe contrast tests showed that office-based physicians had significantly more outpatient visits (19.3 vs.10.7, p<0.001) and significantly higher outpatient costs (US$656 vs. US$402, p<0.001) than hospital-based physicians. Conclusions Physicians had less healthcare utilization than comparison subjects. Furthermore, hospital-based physicians had higher inpatient costs and less outpatient services and costs than office-based physicians."
https://openalex.org/W2413918913,"Down syndrome (DS) is a genetic disorder caused by the presence of an extra copy of human chromosome 21 (Hsa21). People with DS display multiple clinical traits as a result of the dosage imbalance of several hundred genes. While many outcomes of trisomy are deleterious, epidemiological studies have shown a significant risk reduction for most solid tumors in DS. Reduced tumor incidence has also been demonstrated in functional studies using trisomic DS mouse models. Therefore, it was interesting to find that Ts1Rhr trisomic mice developed more papillomas than did their euploid littermates in a DMBA-TPA chemical carcinogenesis paradigm. Papillomas in Ts1Rhr mice also proliferated faster. The increased proliferation was likely caused by a stronger response of trisomy to TPA induction. Treatment with TPA caused hyperkeratosis to a greater degree in Ts1Rhr mice than in euploid, reminiscent of hyperkeratosis seen in people with DS. Cultured trisomic keratinocytes also showed increased TPA-induced proliferation compared to euploid controls. These outcomes suggest that altered gene expression in trisomy could elevate a proliferation signalling pathway. Gene expression analysis of cultured keratinocytes revealed upregulation of several trisomic and disomic genes may contribute to this hyperproliferation. The contributions of these genes to hyper-proliferation were further validated in a siRNA knockdown experiment. The unexpected findings reported here add a new aspect to our understanding of tumorigenesis with clinical implications for DS and demonstrates the complexity of the tumor repression phenotype in this frequent condition."
https://openalex.org/W2232725709,"Variations in markers of adolescent self-organization predict a range of economic and health-related outcomes in general population studies. Using a population-based birth cohort study we investigated associations between adolescent self-organization and two common factors over adulthood influencing health, smoking and alcohol consumption. The MRC National Survey of Health and Development (the British 1946 birth cohort) was used to test associations between a dimensional measure of adolescent self-organization derived from teacher ratings, and summary longitudinal measures of smoking and alcohol consumption over the ensuing five decades. Multinomial regression models were adjusted for sex, adolescent emotional and conduct problems, occupational social class of origin, childhood cognition, educational attainment and adult occupational social class. With all covariates adjusted, higher adolescent self-organization was associated with fewer smoking pack years, although not with quitting; there was no association with alcohol consumption across adulthood (none or heavy compared with light to moderate). Adolescent self-organization appears to be protective against smoking, but not against heavy alcohol consumption. Interpretation of this differential effect should be embedded in an understanding of the social and sociodemographic context in which these health behaviours occur over time."
