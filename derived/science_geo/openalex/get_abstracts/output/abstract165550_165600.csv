These 54-, 14,- and 13-amino acid peptides, with a common RF-amide C terminus, derive from the product of KiSS-1, a metastasis suppressor gene for melanoma cells, and were therefore designated kisspeptins. They bound with low nanomolar affinities to rat and human GPR54 expressed in Chinese hamster ovary K1 cells and stimulated PIP2 hydrolysis, Ca2+ mobilization, arachidonic acid release, ERK1/2 and p38 MAP kinase phosphorylation, and stress fiber formation but inhibited cell proliferation. Human GPR54 was highly expressed in placenta, pituitary, pancreas, and spinal cord, suggesting a role in the regulation of endocrine function. Stimulation of oxytocin secretion after kisspeptin administration to rats confirmed this hypothesis.

Pin J.P. EMBO J. 1999; 19: 1723-1729Crossref Scopus (1230) Google Scholar). Over the last decade, a growing number of orphan G protein-coupled receptors have been made available by various cloning procedures such as PCR1 amplification using degenerate oligonucleotides and systematic sequencing of cDNA libraries and genomes. In human, in addition to about 160 characterized receptors, an equal number of genes encode proteins obviously belonging to this family of receptors, but their ligands and functions remain to be determined. These orphan receptors potentially constitute elements of fundamental communication pathways in various systems. Some of these orphan receptors have been used as tools to uncover these signaling pathways and have led to the validation of novel drug targets (2Civelli O. Nothacker H.P. Saito Y. Wang Z. Lin S.H.

Nociceptin was the first of these novel ligands, purified from tissue extracts with the help of bioassays based on the expression of orphan receptors (3Meunier J.C. Mollereau C. Toll L. Suaudeau C.

GPR54 is an orphan G protein-coupled receptor, originally cloned from rat brain and sharing 45% identity with galanine receptors (10Lee D.K. Nguyen T. O'Neil G.P. Cheng R. Liu Y. Howard A.D. Coulor N. Tan C.P. Tang-Nguyen A.T. George S.R. O'Dowd B.F. FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). It is widely expressed in the rat central nervous system, including the hypothalamus, midbrain, pons, medulla, hippocampus, and amygdala (10Lee D.K. Nguyen T. O'Neil G.P. Cheng R. Liu Y. Howard A.D. Coulor N. Tan C.P. Tang-Nguyen A.T. George S.R. O'Dowd B.F. FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). No natural or surrogate agonists of GPR54 have so far been identified, and its physiological functions are therefore unknown. The gene encoding human GPR54 is present in a bacterial artificial chromosome mapped to chromosome 2 (GenBankTMaccession number AC023583). In this work, we have tested tissue extracts on the basis of the distribution of GPR54 in human tissues. A biological activity was found in a placenta extract, and active peptides were purified and identified by mass spectrometry. They were found to derive from the previously described metastasis suppressor gene KiSS-1. The pharmacology of the peptides, signaling properties of the receptor, and in vivofunction of this new system in vivo were investigated. RT-PCR experiments were carried out as described previously (11Kotani M. Mollereau C. Detheux M. Le Poul E. Brézillon S. Vakili J. Mazarguil H. Vassart G. Zajac J.M. Parmentier M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 133: 138-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Seventy-five ng of poly(A)+ RNA from various human tissues (CLONTECH) were tested using sense (5′-TGTACAACCTGCTGGCGCTG-3′) and antisense (5′-CCACTGCTCCCTGGCTTCTG-3′) primers for human GPR54. Amplification of aldolase transcripts was performed in parallel as control. The coding sequence of rat (GenBankTM accession number AF115516) and human (GenBankTM accession number AY029541) GPR54 was amplified by PCR from rat or human hypothalamus cDNA using rat sense (5′-ATCGGAATTCACCATGGCCGCAGAGGCGACGTTG-3′) and antisense (5′-ATCATCTAGATCAGAGTGGGGCAGTGTGTTCATC-3′) and human sense (5′-ATCGGAATTCACCATGCACACCGTGGCTACGTC-3′) and antisense (5′-ATCATCTAGAACAGAAGAATAGCCGCTGTTCCAGCAG-3′) primers. Amplified DNA fragments were subcloned into the pEFIN3 bicistronic vector (12Blanpain C. Doranz B.J. Vakili J. Rucker J. Govaerts C. Baik S.S.W. Lorthioir O. Migeotte I. Libert F. Baleux F.

These plasmids were transfected into CHO-K1 cells expressing Gα16 and a mitochondria-targeted form of apo-aequorin. Clonal cell lines were established, and functional responses were analyzed using a bioassay based on the luminescence of aequorin as a result of intracellular calcium release, as described previously (12Blanpain C. Doranz B.J. Vakili J. Rucker J. Govaerts C. Baik S.S.W. Lorthioir O. Migeotte I. Libert F. Baleux F. Vassart G. Doms R.W. Parmentier M. J. Biol.

Briefly, cells (25,000 cells in 50 μl) were added to 50-μl samples in 96-well plates, and the luminescence was recorded for 30 s (PerkinElmer Life Sciences luminometer). Human placenta (1200 g) was homogenized in 6 liters of ice-cold methanol/water/acetic acid (90:9:1). The homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 × gfor 30 min at 4 °C, methanol was evaporated (Rotavapor), and lipids were extracted three times with dichloromethane. After trifluoroacetic acid (0.1%) addition, the extract was filtered (0.45 μm of Millipak 20 filter, Millipore), applied to a DeltaPak C18 column (40 × 300 mm, 15-μm beads, 300-Å pore size, Waters) and eluted with 80% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 100 ml/min. The eluate was loaded on the same column, a linear 0–80% acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid was applied over 80 min at 100 ml/min, and 50-ml fractions were collected. Fractions were tested on rat GPR54 using the aequorin-based assay. Active fractions were fractionated separately by two steps. First, a Symmetry 300 C18 column (4.6 × 250 mm, 5 μm, 300 Å, Waters) was eluted with a 0–27% acetonitrile gradient in 82 min, 27% acetonitrile for 30 min, and 27–50% gradient in 69 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Second, a Vydac C18 column (1.0 × 250 mm, 5 μm, 300 Å, Vydac) was eluted with 20–35% methanol gradient in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid over 15 min, 35–45% methanol gradient over 30 min, 45% methanol for 30 min, and 45–100% methanol gradient over 55 min at a flow rate of 50 μl/min. Fractions of 50 μl were collected. The active fractions were dried and analyzed by a prototype tandem matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer (Micromass). CHO-K1 cells (5 × 105) were incubated with125I-kisspeptin-10 (60,000 cpm, 2,200 Ci/mmol) as tracer and various peptides as competitors in 300 μl of assay buffer as described in Langmead et al. (13Langmead C.J. Szekeres P.G. Chambers J.K. Ratcliffe S.J. Jones D.N. Hirst W.D. Price G.W. Herdon H.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 131: 683-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) at 25 °C for 1 h, filtered through Whatman 934-AH filters preincubated with 0.5% polyethylenimine, and washed with ice-cold buffer. Bound radioactivity was counted in a COBRA II counter (Packard Instrument Co.). For intracellular Ca2+ assays, cells pretreated or not with 100 ng/ml pertussis toxin for 15 h were incubated in Hanks' balanced salt medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 2.8 μg/ml Fura-2 (Molecular Probes) at 37 °C for 45 min as described (11Kotani M. Mollereau C. Detheux M. Le Poul E. Brézillon S. Vakili J. Mazarguil H. Vassart G. Zajac J.M. Parmentier M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 133: 138-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Cells were used at a density of 106/ml, and intracellular Ca2+ was measured using a luminescence spectrophotometer LS50B (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). CHO-K1 cells were cultured overnight in DMEM containing 5% FCS and 1 μCi/mlmyo-[3H]inositol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), detached with phosphate-buffered saline-EDTA, washed, and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C with kisspeptin-10 in 500 μl of 25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 121.5 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 0.8 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mmCaCl2, 15 mm glucose, and 10 mmLiCl. Incubation was terminated by adding 500 μl of buffer containing 88% methanol and 0.12 m HCl, and cells were filtered through Whatman GF/B filters and washed with ice-cold buffer. Bound radioactivity was measured on a TRI-CARB 2100TR counter (Packard Instrument Co.). Recombinant CHO-K1 cells (2.5 × 106 cells/well in 6-well plates) were cultured overnight with 0.1 μCi/ml [3H]arachidonic acid (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), washed, and incubated for 60 min at 37 °C with peptides in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin or vehicle alone as described (14Gijon M.A. Spencer D.M. Siddiqi A.R. Bonventre J.V. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20146-20156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The radioactivity in the supernatant was measured in a TRI-CARB 2100TR counter (Packard Instrument Co.). Recombinant CHO-K1 cells were cultured overnight in FCS-free medium, incubated with agonists or vehicle for various times, lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 8.7% glycerol, 0.1 mdithiothreitol, 2% SDS, and heated to 100 °C for 5 min. Approximately 20 μg of proteins for ERK1/2 and 50 μg proteins for p38 and stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase were electrophoresed on 10% polyacrylamide gels and blotted to nylon membranes (PolyScreen, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Phosphorylated ERK1/2, p38, and stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase were detected, respectively, with anti-phospho-p44/42 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase E10 monoclonal antibody, anti-phospho-p38 MAP kinase polyclonal antibody, anti-phospho- stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase monoclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) and an ECL detection reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For assaying proliferation, CHO-K1 cells (5 × 105 cells/10-cm diameter dish) were seeded in 10% FCS medium and incubated with or without 1 μmkisspeptin-10 for 24, 48, and 72 h. Cells were trypsinized, and cell numbers were counted using a hematocytometer. CHO-K1 cells were cultured on cover glasses with or without 5 μg/ml C3 exoenzyme (Sigma) in 10% FCS medium for 24 h and further in FCS-free medium for 24 h. Cells were then incubated with 1 μm kisspeptin-10 or vehicle for 2 h, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline, and stained with phycoerythrin-labeled phalloidin (Molecular Probes). Staining was observed by a confocal fluorescence microscopy (Axiovert 100, Zeiss) connected with MRC1024 imaging system (Bio-Rad). Female Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats weighting 230–250 g were anesthetized with ether and received 25 μg of kisspeptin-10 in 100 μl of physiological saline or vehicle alone into the left tail vein. After decapitation between 8 and 9 a.m., blood was collected into plastic syringes containing 500 units/ml aprotinin and 1 mg/ml Na2-EDTA. Plasma was rapidly separated by centrifugation at 4 °C. Plasma oxytocin concentrations were measured by Oxytocin Correlate-EIA kit (Assay Designs). To identify potential sources of endogenous ligands, we tested the expression of GPR54 by RT-PCR in a set of human tissues. As shown in Fig.1, GPR54 transcripts were particularly abundant in placenta, pituitary, spinal cord, and pancreas, whereas it was found at lower levels in other tissues, including various brain regions, stomach, small intestine, thymus, spleen, lung, testis, kidney, and fetal liver. CHO-K1 cell lines expressing rat GPR54 (Fig. 2) together with Gα16 and apo-aequorin were used in a functional assay based on the luminescence of aequorin to identify natural ligands of the receptor. Extracts from various organs, including brain, placenta, intestine, stomach, lung, testis, and kidney were fractionated by HPLC, and individual fractions were tested in the aequorin-based assay using untransfected CHO-K1 cells and cell lines expressing other receptors as negative controls. Two peaks of biological activity specific for rat GRP54 were identified in fractions of a human placenta extract. These activities were purified through a number of HPLC columns (Fig. 3), and the active fractions resulting from the last step were analyzed by mass spectrometry. Sequencing and comparison of the corresponding masses with the protein and nucleotide data bases resulted in the identification in one peak of two short overlapping peptides of 13 and 14 amino acids, terminating by a common RF-amide motif (Fig.4). In the other peak, the same peptides were associated with a longer form of 54 amino acids with the same C terminus. All three peptides were predicted to derive from a previously identified protein named KiSS-1 (16Lee J.H. Miele M.E. Hicks D.J. Phillips K.K. Trent J.M. Weissman B.E. Welch D.R. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1996; 88: 1731-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). The three peptides were therefore designated as kisspeptin-54, kisspeptin-14, and kisspeptin-13.Figure 3Purification of kisspeptins from human placenta extracts.

The biological activity of the fractions on rat GPR54 using the aequorin-based functional assay is shown. Two peaks of biological activity, eluting at 32 min (fraction 64) and 33 min (fraction 66) were observed and were further purified separately. B, second step of purification for fraction 64 using a Symmetry 300 C18 column. A single peak of activity (90 min) was observed. C, third step of purification, using a Vydac C18 column.

The human receptor is 80.5% identical to rat GPR54, with most differences located within the N-terminal and C-terminal domains as well as in the third extracellular loop. The predicted transmembrane segments share 98% identity (Fig.2). Human GPR54 was expressed in a Gα16 and apo-aequorin-expressing CHO-K1 cell line. We synthesized kisspeptin-54, kisspeptin-14, and kisspeptin-13 as well as a shorter variant designated kisspeptin-10 (YNWNSFGLRF-NH2, the shortest truncated peptide containing a tyrosine available for iodination), and their biological activity on GPR54 was confirmed. Non-amidated peptides were inactive (data not shown). Kisspeptin-10 was iodinated, and binding experiments were performed on CHO-K1 cells expressing rat or human GPR54. Saturation binding using 125I-kisspeptin-10 (Fig. 5 A and not shown for human GPR54) revealed a single high affinity binding site (Kd of 1.0 ± 0.1 and 1.9 ± 0.4 nm and Bmax of 34.2 ± 1.9 and 2.4 ± 0.3 fmol/106 cells for rat and human GPR54, respectively). In competition binding experiments, kisspeptin-54, kisspeptin-14, kisspeptin-13, and kisspeptin-10 were equipotent on both the rat and human receptors (Fig. 5, B andC). For the rat receptor, Ki values were 1.81 ± 0.05, 2.04 ± 0.03, 2.08 ± 0.04, and 1.59 ± 0.07 nm for, respectively, kisspeptin-54, -14, -13, and -10. For the human receptor, Ki values were 1.45 ± 0.1, 1.65 ± 0.15, 4.23 ± 0.10, and 2.33 ± 0.13 nm for, respectively, kisspeptin-54, -14, -13, and -10. In the aequorin-based functional assay, the three peptides were also equally potent on both rat and human GPR54 (Fig. 5, Dand E). For the rat receptor, EC50 values were 1.39 ± 0.03, 1.33 ± 0.01, 1.38 ± 0.02, and 1.17 ± 0.02 nm for, respectively, kisspeptin-54, -14, -13, and -10. For the human receptor, EC50 values were 5.47 ± 0.03, 7.22 ± 0.07, 4.62 ± 0.02, and 4.13 ± 0.02 nm for, respectively, kisspeptin-54, -14, -13, and -10. The higher EC50 of the peptides for human GPR54 are attributed to its lower expression in the recombinant cell line. Other peptides with RF-amide C termini, including neuropeptide FF, neuropeptide AF, and prolactin-releasing peptide did not elicit functional responses up to 1 μm concentrations (data not shown). To determine the natural coupling properties of the receptor to intracellular signaling pathways, CHO-K1 cell lines expressing human or rat GPR54 but not Gα16 or apo-aequorin were established. Kisspeptin-10 stimulated Ca2+ mobilization and phosphatidylinositol turnover in these cells (Fig. 6,A and B). This effect was not affected by pertussis toxin pretreatment. No modification of cAMP accumulation was observed after stimulation of the rat or human GPR54 (data not shown). These results suggest that GPR54 is coupled with proteins of the Gq class. Kisspeptins also stimulated arachidonic acid release from CHO cells expressing rat or human GPR54 in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 6, C andD). Given the previous description of KiSS-1 as a tumor suppressor gene, we evaluated the effects of kisspeptins on cell proliferation and cytoskeleton organization. In CHO cells expressing human or rat GPR54, we observed a strong and sustained stimulation of phosphorylation of the MAP kinases ERK1 and ERK2 (Fig. 6, E and F). We also observed a weak stimulation of p38 MAP kinase phosphorylation (Fig. 6 G) but not of stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK) (Fig.6 H). However, despite the involvement of the MAP kinase pathways in the control of cell cycle and proliferation, culturing recombinant CHO cells in the presence of kisspeptin-10 resulted in a strong reduction of cell proliferation (Fig.7). The peptide had no effect on untransfected CHO-K1 cells. No evidence of cell death by apoptosis was found either by flow cytometry using phycoerythrin-conjugated annexin V or a genomic DNA fragmentation assay (data not shown). Actin microfilament reorganization in recombinant CHO-K1 cells was monitored using phycoerythrin-labeled phalloidin and confocal microscopy. Kisspeptin-10 stimulated stress fiber formation in CHO cells expressing rat GPR54 (Fig. 6I). This effect was abolished in cells pretreated with C3 exoenzyme, suggesting that kisspeptin-10 stimulated stress fiber formation through activation of the Rho subfamily of G proteins. Identical results were obtained with cells expressing human GPR54, whereas kisspeptins had no effects on untransfected CHO-K1 cells (not shown). We have started to investigate the function of GPR54 and its ligands in vivo. Given the high expression of GPR54 in hypothalamus and pituitary, we postulated that it could be involved in the control of hormone release. We tested in a first approach the effect of kisspeptin-10 onto oxytocin plasma level in mature female rats. Administration of 25 μg of kisspeptin-10 through the tail vein promoted a significant increase of oxytocin with a maximum 30 min after the injection (Fig.8). GPR54 is an orphan G protein-coupled receptor structurally related to neuropeptide receptors and, particularly, to galanine receptors. The rat and human cDNAs encoding GPR54 were cloned on the basis of sequences available in the data bases. As for most G protein-coupled receptors, predicted transmembrane segments displayed high interspecies conservation. Low similarity was, however, found in the third extracellular loop and the C-terminal intracellular domain (Fig. 2), suggesting that these regions do not play essential roles in the receptor's function. We determined the distribution of the receptor in human tissues by RT-PCR. GPR54 was found to be expressed in most tissues tested, including in the central nervous system, gut, and endocrine organs. The highest expression was found in pituitary and placenta. This distribution pattern was used to select the tissues in which the potential ligands of GPR54 could be present. No convincing biological activities were detected in extracts from brain, pituitary, and gut segments, whereas a strong biological activity was detected in a human placenta extract, allowing purification of the active compounds from this source. This led to the identification of kisspeptins, peptides encoded by the previously described gene KiSS-1. KiSS-1 was isolated as a tumor metastasis suppressor gene for the human malignant melanoma cell line C8161 by a subtraction cloning method (16Lee J.H. Miele M.E. Hicks D.J. Phillips K.K. Trent J.M. Weissman B.E. Welch D.R. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1996; 88: 1731-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar, 17Lee J.H. Welch D.R. Int. J.

The predicted product of KiSS-1 is a 145-amino acid protein with a putative signal sequence. The secretory nature of the protein was, however, not demonstrated so far. KiSS-1 does not share similarities with any other protein in the data bases. The metastasis potential of melanoma and breast cancer cell lines in vivowas suppressed after KiSS-1 transfection without affecting the proliferation and migration properties of the cells (16Lee J.H. Miele M.E. Hicks D.J. Phillips K.K. Trent J.M. Weissman B.E. Welch D.R. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1996; 88: 1731-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar, 19Lee J.H. Welch D.R. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2384-2387PubMed Google Scholar). KiSS-1 was also reported to inhibit MMP-9 production when transfected in HT1080 cells (20Yan C. Wang H. Boyd D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1164-1172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms underlying these observations were, however, not identified. Three peptides of 54, 14, and 13 amino acids were identified within the active fractions, and their biological activity was confirmed for the synthetic peptides. The long peptide (54 amino acids) is predicted to result from the proteolytic processing of KiSS-1 by furin or prohormone convertases, as its sequence is surrounded by pairs of basic residues in the full-size protein (Fig. 4). No obvious cleavage sites were found that would result in the generation of the two shorter peptides. Their presence in the same fraction as the longer peptide suggested that the 54-amino acid peptide might be unstable and degraded into the shorter peptides during the extraction procedure, or even during mass spectrometry analysis. In binding and functional assays, it was found that kisspeptin-54, -14, and -13 as well as a shorter peptide designated kisspeptin-10 had the same affinity and efficacy on the rat receptor. This indicates that the C-terminal part of the peptides is responsible both for the high affinity binding and the activation of GPR54. The major role of the RF-amide moiety was demonstrated by the lack of binding and functional response for non-amidated synthetic kisspeptins. Other determinants within the C-terminal 10 amino acids are likely to contribute to the binding and functional properties of the peptides, as other RF-amide peptides had no detectable activity. The observations were similar for the human receptor, although in several functional assays, the EC50 of the peptides was higher than for the rat receptor as a consequence of the lower expression level of the human receptor in the recombinant cell lines. The high affinity of kisspeptins for GPR54, their isolation from a tissue that expresses GPR54, and the predicted processing of KiSS-1 into kisspeptin-54 strongly suggest that these peptides indeed constitute natural agonists of the orphan receptor. Analysis of the transduction pathways activated by GPR54 in CHO-K1 cells identified coupling to phospholipase C and intracellular calcium release through pertussis toxin-insensitive (presumably Gq) G proteins. GPR54 also stimulated arachidonic acid release, ERK1/2 and p38 activation, three pathways often activated by G protein-coupled receptors. Interestingly, despite activation of the ERK pathway, kisspeptins strongly inhibited the proliferation rate of the cells expressing GPR54. This proliferation arrest induced by GPR54 activation is not a property shared by all Gq-coupled receptors, as the angiotensin AT1A and vasopressin V1 receptors have been reported previously to stimulate proliferation in CHO cells (21Guillemot L.

Kisspeptins also induced stress fiber formation in GPR54-expressing cells through Rho activation. This observation might be linked to an earlier report describing faster spreading to culture plates of breast cancer cells transfected with KiSS-1 cDNA (19Lee J.H. Welch D.R. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2384-2387PubMed Google Scholar), although expression of GPR54 was not investigated in these cells. After completion of this study, the identification of kisspeptins as ligands of GPR54 was reported by Ohtaki et al. (23Ohtaki T. Shintani Y. Honda S. Matsumoto H. Hori A. Kanehashi K. Terao Y.

In conclusion, we have isolated KiSS-1-derived peptides from human placenta as high affinity natural agonists of a previously orphan G protein-coupled receptor designated GPR54. Tissue distribution suggested that GPR54 might be implicated in various hormonal function, a hypothesis supported by the demonstration that KiSS-1-derived peptides stimulate oxytocin release in rats. It is, however, likely that many other biological actions of kisspeptins in vivowill be uncovered in the future. The correlation of the present observations with the previous description of KiSS-1 as a tumor metastasis suppressor gene will require further investigations.

Because Rho family GTPases regulate actin dynamics, we investigated whether cadherin-mediated adhesion regulates the activity of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42. Confluent epithelial cells were found to have elevated Rac1 and Cdc42 activity but decreased RhoA activity when compared with low density cultures. Using a calcium switch method to manipulate junction assembly, we found that induction of cell-cell junctions increased Rac1 activity, and this was inhibited by E-cadherin function-blocking antibodies. Using the same calcium switch procedure, we found little effect on RhoA activity during the first hour of junction assembly. However, over several hours, RhoA activity significantly decreased. To determine whether these effects are mediated directly through cadherins or indirectly through engagement of other surface proteins downstream from junction assembly, we used a model system in which cadherin engagement is induced without cell-cell contact. For these experiments, Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing C-cadherin were plated on the extracellular domain of C-cadherin immobilized on tissue culture plates. Whereas direct cadherin engagement did not stimulate Cdc42 activity, it strongly inhibited RhoA activity but increased Rac1 activity. Deletion of the C-cadherin cytoplasmic domain abolished these effects.

Cadherins are a major class of cell adhesion molecules responsible for strong cell-cell adhesion. In epithelial cells, cadherins are concentrated within adherens junctions (AJs).1 Here their extracellular domains interact homophilically with cadherins on adjacent cells, and their cytoplasmic domains provide attachment to the actin cytoskeleton via catenins and other cytoskeletal proteins (1Gumbiner B.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 345-347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2960) Google Scholar,2Takeichi M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar). Structural components of AJs have been well characterized (3Yap A.S. Brieher W.M. Gumbiner B.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1997; 11: 549-599Google Scholar, 4Adams C.L. Nelson W.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 572-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), while more recently attention has been focused on signaling events at the cytoplasmic face of cell-cell junctions. The Rho family of low molecular weight GTP-binding proteins is important for cadherin-mediated adhesion. Several lines of evidence suggest that members of the Rho family are required for the establishment and maintenance of cadherin-based AJs (5Braga V.M. Machesky L.M. Hall A. Hotchin N.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1421-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 6Hordijk P.L. ten Klooster J.P. van der Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Oomen L.C. Collard J.G.

In fibroblasts, RhoA activation stimulates assembly of stress fibers and focal adhesions, whereas activation of Rac1 and Cdc42 promote lamellipodial and filopodial extensions, respectively (10Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5242) Google Scholar). In epithelial cells, overexpression of constitutively active Rac1 or Cdc42 increases E-cadherin localization and actin accumulation at cell-cell junctions, whereas these events are inhibited by dominant negative mutants of Rac1 and Cdc42 (6Hordijk P.L. ten Klooster J.P. van der Kammen R.A.

Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). When epithelial cells are grown at low density, such that they cannot develop AJs, these cells often appear more fibroblastic and exhibit stress fibers and focal adhesions. AJ development is accompanied by a decrease in stress fibers and focal adhesions. The idea that AJs may negatively regulate focal adhesions is further supported by the finding that localized stimulation of N-cadherin results in decreased vinculin labeling and tyrosine phosphorylation in focal adhesions (13Levenberg S. Katz B. Yamada K. Geiger B. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 347-357PubMed Google Scholar, 14Lambert M. Padilla F. Mege R.M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2207-2219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The observations that RhoA regulates focal adhesions and stress fibers raise the possibility that formation of cell-cell junctions may depress RhoA activity, thereby decreasing focal adhesions. In this work we have used several strategies to investigate whether cell-cell adhesion and cadherin engagement affect the activities of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42. CHO, HEK293, and NIH3T3 cells were cultured as described previously (15Noren N.K. Liu B.P. Burridge K. Kreft B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 567-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. CEC1–5 cells were cultured as described (16Brieher W.M. Yap A.S. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 487-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). To generate stable cell lines expressing C-cadherin (C-Cad) and C-cadherin with a cytoplasmic truncation (C-CT), CHO cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE Plus reagents (Life Technologies, Inc.), and transfected cells were selected using 800 μg/ml G418. G418-resistant cells were fluorescence-activated cell-sorted by labeling with an antibody against the extracellular domain of C-cadherin, and expressing clones were obtained. Several clonal cell lines were analyzed for each assay performed. For density experiments on epithelial cells, MDCK cells were trypsinized, extensively triturated to generate a maximally dispersed cell suspension, and plated in the presence of serum. Suspended cells were plated at a 1:3 dilution for the high density cultures and at a 1:10 dilution for low density cultures. Cells were allowed to recover for 24 h before measurement of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 activity. RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 activity assays were performed as described previously (15Noren N.K. Liu B.P. Burridge K. Kreft B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 567-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Quantitation was performed by densitometric analysis of Western blots using Metamorph Image software. The relative amount of active GTPases was determined by measuring the amount of GTPases sedimented by glutathioneS-transferase-Rac1/Cdc42-binding domain of PAK or -RhoA-binding domain of Rhotekin relative to the amount in whole cell lysates. For calcium switch experiments, cells were incubated overnight in low calcium medium (10 μm). The medium was then switched to high calcium medium (1.8 mm) at various time points with or without E-cadherin function-blocking antibodies (DECMA clone-1 at 1:100 dilution) (Sigma-Aldrich), and Rac1 and Cdc42 activity levels were measured. For RhoA activity assays, cells were serum-starved overnight, and cell-cell junctions were disrupted by incubation with 4 mm EGTA for 30 min at 37 °C (17Volberg T. Geiger B. Kartenbeck J. Franke W.W. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1832-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 18Kinch M.S. Petch L. Zhong C. Burridge K. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1997; 4: 425-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Cell-cell junction formation was then stimulated by the addition of serum-free DMEM. RhoA activity was measured in serum-free conditions to reduce background levels because of serum activation of RhoA. We also used this procedure for the Rac1 activity measurements and obtained identical results with both procedures. The C-cadherin extracellular (CEC) domain was purified essentially as described previously (16Brieher W.M. Yap A.S. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 487-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) except the Mono Q step was omitted. The CEC domains were linked to tissue culture dishes by coating with 5% 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (Pierce) in 1 mm acetic acid for 10 min. Dishes were washed and incubated with 0.5% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 30 min, washed, and then incubated with 1 μg/ml nitrilotriacetic acid ligand (NTA, Qiagen) for 20 min and charged with 100 mm nickel sulfate in water for 20 min. Dishes were then incubated with 20 μg/ml CEC overnight at 4 °C with rotation and then blocked in 1% bovine serum albumin in DMEM. In preliminary studies, we analyzed the binding of CEC to the 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane-coated dishes using radioiodinated CEC. Saturated binding was obtained at a concentration of 20 μg/ml. For CEC binding experiments, cells were starved overnight in 0.5% fetal bovine serum in the absence of G418. Cells were washed with PBS, suspended with 0.2 mm EDTA in PBS, washed twice in DMEM, and suspended for 0.5 h prior to plating in 0.5% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin in DMEM. To measure the effect of cell junction development on the activity of RhoA, we first determined whether the level of active RhoA differed in epithelial cells grown at high or low densities. MDCK cells were plated such that they were confluent or at a density at which they would develop few contacts with their neighbors. The cells were maintained in serum for ∼24 h before the level of active, GTP-bound RhoA was measured using Rhotekin affinity precipitation (19Ren X. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1370) Google Scholar). This revealed a decrease in active RhoA by ∼95% in the confluent MDCK cells relative to the low density cultures (p < 0.0001) (Fig. 1 A). The total level of RhoA expressed in MDCK cells was similar in both conditions. In addition, we examined the level of active RhoA in HEK293 and NIH3T3 cells at high and low density. HEK293 cells are epithelial in origin but express lower levels of E-cadherin than MDCK cells and do not assemble well developed AJs, whereas NIH3T3 cells are fibroblastic and lack E-cadherin. With the HEK293 cells, confluent cultures displayed a ∼40% decrease in RhoA activity (p < 0.04). NIH3T3 cells displayed no significant change in the level of active RhoA under these conditions of differing cell densities (p= 0.19) (Fig. 1 A). The marked depression in RhoA activity in confluent cultures of MDCK cells prompted us to examine the effect of cell density on the activities of Rac1 and Cdc42 using affinity precipitation of the GTP-bound forms of these proteins (20Bagrodia S. Taylor S.J. Jordon K.A. Van Aelst L. Cerione R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23633-23636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 21Benard V. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13198-13204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). With MDCK cells, there was a 3.7 ± 0.9-fold increase in Rac1 activity and a 3.3 ± 1.1-fold increase in Cdc42 activity in confluent cultures (p < 0.05 and 0.02; Fig. 1, B andC). The total levels of Rac1 and Cdc42 were comparable in confluent and subconfluent cultures. In confluent HEK293 cells there was a 1.9 ± 0.4-fold increase in Rac1 activity and a 1.4 ± 0.1-fold increase in Cdc42 activity compared with subconfluent cells (p < 0.14 and 0.04). There was no significant change in Rac1 or Cdc42 activity between subconfluent and confluent cultures of NIH3T3 fibroblasts (p < 0.65 and 0.69; Fig. 1,B and C). To examine the role of cell-cell junctions in the depression of RhoA activity and elevation of Rac1 and Cdc42 that occur with high cell density, we manipulated cadherin-mediated junction formation by varying the level of extracellular calcium in the culture medium. Under conditions of low calcium, cadherin function is blocked, and epithelial cells fail to develop or maintain AJs (17Volberg T. Geiger B. Kartenbeck J. Franke W.W. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1832-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Restoration of calcium stimulates the rapid reformation of these adhesions. In low calcium conditions, the cells lacked AJs, as judged by immunofluorescence, and the E-cadherin was distributed diffusely over the surface of the cells (data not shown). Upon restoration of normal calcium levels, E-cadherin accumulated at sites of cell-cell contact within 5–10 min, and junctions appeared to be well developed within 1 h as determined by staining with antibodies against several junctional proteins (data not shown). In response to calcium addition, there was little or no change in RhoA activity for the first hour (Fig.2 A). Over longer time periods, however, RhoA activity decreased so that by 8 h it was very low. This slow response led us to question whether in addition to junctions depressing RhoA activity, the “calcium switch” manipulation itself may activate RhoA independently of junction assembly. To explore this possibility, the effect of the calcium switch manipulations on RhoA activity was determined using cells that lack cadherins (CHO cells) or that lack specifically E-cadherin (Rat1 cells). This approach revealed that RhoA activity was stimulated for at least 1 h in response to restoring normal extracellular calcium levels, suggesting that simply changing the exogenous calcium levels results in activation of RhoA through a cadherin-independent pathway (Fig. 2 A and data not shown). The level of active Rac1 was measured in MDCK cells in which AJs had been induced to form by the calcium switch procedure. Under these conditions, an increase in Rac1 activity was detected within 5 min (Fig. 2 B). To determine whether this increase in Rac1 activity required E-cadherin engagement, the restoration of calcium was performed in medium containing E-cadherin function-blocking antibodies (DECMA-1) (Fig. 2 B). The increase in Rac1 activity induced by calcium restoration was blocked by DECMA-1, suggesting that E-cadherin is critical for Rac1 activation. We did not observe changes in Rac1 activity in CHO cells (Fig. 2 B) or Rat1 cells (data not shown) following the calcium switch procedure. The level of active Cdc42 was also measured in MDCK cells developing junctions in response to calcium restoration. Cdc42 activity was stimulated under these conditions (data not shown) as reported by others (22Kim S.H. Li Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36999-37005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The results detailed above do not distinguish whether the activation of Rac1 and Cdc42 and decrease in RhoA activity occurred directly via cadherins or indirectly as a result of adherens junction formation engaging other signaling components. To address the question of whether cadherins themselves signal directly to Rho family proteins, we examined cadherin engagement in the absence of cell-cell adhesion. For these experiments we generated CHO cell lines that stably express full-length Xenopus C-Cad or C-CT. C-cadherin is a classical cadherin closely related to E-cadherin. To engage the C-cadherin, a His-tagged construct of the CEC was purified from conditioned medium and bound to tissue culture plates via the His tag (see “Experimental Procedures”). We confirmed that adhesion to this surface was dependent on calcium in the extracellular medium (data not shown). C-Cad cells were starved overnight in 0.5% serum and plated on surfaces coated with the CEC domain, and the levels of active RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 were measured at successive time points (Fig.3). This revealed that within 30 min there was a marked drop in RhoA activity, which was sustained over longer time periods. At 30 min there was a slight dip in Rac1 activity, but by 1 h Rac1 activity was strongly stimulated. Little change in Cdc42 activity was detected under these conditions. The effect of the C-cadherin cytoplasmic domain truncation was examined with respect to the changes in activities of RhoA and Rac1. When C-CT cells were plated on surfaces coated with CEC, no changes in RhoA or Rac1 activity were detected (Fig. 3, Aand B). Similarly, no change in the activity of Rac1 was detected when the parental CHO cells lacking C-cadherin expression were plated on CEC (data not shown). As positive controls, the C-Cad cells were plated on dishes coated with fibronectin. This resulted in a biphasic response in RhoA activity, with an initial dip being followed by a more prolonged elevation in activity (data not shown) as also reported by others (19Ren X. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1370) Google Scholar, 23Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Sieg D.J. Otey C.A. Schlaepfer D.D. Schwartz M.A. J.

In response to adhesion to fibronectin, C-Cad cells demonstrated an increase in Rac1 and Cdc42 activity (data not shown) similar to that described in other cell types (24Arthur W.T. Petch L.A. Burridge K. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 719-722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 25Price L.S. Leng J. Schwartz M.A. Bokoch G.M. Mol. Biol.

Cell. 2001; 12: 265-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The observation that assembly of epithelial AJs is well known to be associated with reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton (28Vasioukhin V. Fuchs E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 76-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) led us to investigate whether members of the Rho family GTPases are regulated by the formation of AJs. In this study, we found that adherens junction assembly triggers a dramatic decrease in RhoA activity and a stimulation of Rac1 and Cdc42 activity. Kim and colleagues (22Kim S.H. Li Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36999-37005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) recently used the calcium switch procedure to demonstrate that formation of AJs stimulates the activity of Cdc42. After completion of the current work, Nakagawa et al.(29Nakagawa M. Fukata M. Yamaga M. Itoh N. Kaibuchi K. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1829-1838Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) described the activation of Rac1 in response to assembly of AJs. We have extended these observations not only by examining RhoA activity following junction formation but also by determining whether the activation of Rac1 and Cdc42 and the decrease in RhoA activity is due to signaling directly via cadherins or indirectly via assembly of AJs. When AJs assemble, the plasma membranes of adjacent cells are brought into close proximity so that low affinity interactions may occur between signaling components on adjacent cells. To analyze whether the signaling was initiated directly by cadherins, we plated cells expressing C-cadherin on the extracellular domain of C-cadherin. Using this system, we found that cadherin engagement without cell-cell adhesion was sufficient to induce the decrease in RhoA activity and the increase in Rac1 activity. Significantly, these effects were not observed when the cytoplasmic domain of C-cadherin was deleted, implying that interactions mediated by the cytoplasmic domain are critical in these signaling pathways. Interestingly, although we and others (22Kim S.H. Li Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36999-37005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) have observed activation of Cdc42 in the calcium switch paradigm, we did not observe significant activation of Cdc42 upon direct cadherin engagement using the C-cadherin system. This suggests that activation of Cdc42 is secondary to cadherin engagement, possibly occurring by AJs juxtaposing signaling molecules that interact between adjacent cells. The decrease in RhoA activity we observed is in contrast to the recent results presented by Nakagawa et al. (29Nakagawa M. Fukata M. Yamaga M. Itoh N. Kaibuchi K. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1829-1838Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Like us, they observed that the calcium switch did not induce a notable change in RhoA activity over the time course of their experiments. However, when we performed the same calcium manipulations on fibroblasts, these experiments indicated that RhoA was activated in these cells in response to calcium restoration. It seems likely that the initial calcium-induced stimulation of RhoA activity obscured any decrease in RhoA activity that results from cadherin engagement. These observations raise important concerns about drawing conclusions from the calcium switch paradigm when this is the only way in which cadherin engagement is manipulated. What is the significance of the changes in activity of the Rho family of proteins as AJs develop? Multiple studies indicate that Rac1 and Cdc42 activities are needed for the assembly of AJs (6Hordijk P.L. ten Klooster J.P. van der Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Oomen L.C. Collard J.G.

In addition, low levels of RhoA activity also appear necessary (5Braga V.M. Machesky L.M. Hall A. Hotchin N.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1421-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 8Zhong C.

Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), although high RhoA activity is disruptive (8Zhong C. Kinch M.S. Burridge K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2329-2344Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 12Jou T.S. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The stimulation of Rac1 and Cdc42 upon adherens junction assembly indicates a positive feedback loop that may contribute to the stability of junctions in epithelial sheets. On the other hand, the depression of RhoA activity may also be important so that myosin activity is kept low and excessive tension is not applied to the junctions. Our current efforts are directed toward elucidating the pathways by which cadherin engagement depresses RhoA and elevates Rac1 activity. Multiple GTPase-activating proteins for RhoA have been identified. We are investigating known GTPase-activating proteins for RhoA that might be involved in this pathway. In previous work, we and others demonstrated that the cadherin-binding protein, p120 catenin (p120ctn), decreases RhoA activity and increases Rac1 and Cdc42 activity when over-expressed in cells (15Noren N.K. Liu B.P. Burridge K. Kreft B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 567-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 30Anastasiadis P.Z. Reynolds A.B. J.

Additionally, we demonstrated that p120ctn binds to the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Vav2 (15Noren N.K. Liu B.P. Burridge K. Kreft B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 567-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). However, we consider it to be unlikely that p120ctn is involved in these pathways from cadherins to RhoA and Rac1, because during AJ formation p120ctn is recruited to the cadherin-catenin complex reducing cytosolic levels of p120ctn. Our previous data indicated that p120ctn only affected the activities of RhoA and Rac1 when it was not bound to cadherins but was in the cytosolic pool making it unlikely that regulation of Rho proteins by cadherin engagement is through p120ctn. In preliminary work, we have not detected activation of Vav2 by adherens junction formation. 2N. K. Noren and K. Burridge, unpublished results.One potential pathway to Rac1 activation is suggested by the finding that adherens junction formation stimulates PI3-kinase activity (32Pece S. Chiariello M. Murga C. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19347-19351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). In their recent work, Nakagawa and co-workers (29Nakagawa M. Fukata M. Yamaga M. Itoh N. Kaibuchi K. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1829-1838Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) found that inhibition of PI3-kinase blocked activation of Rac1 by cadherin-mediated adhesion. We have also made this observation.2 A Rac1 exchange factor downstream of PI3-kinase is Tiam1 (33Sander E.E. van Delft S. ten Klooster J.P. Reid L. van der Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1385-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar), and Tiam1 localizes to cell-cell junctions (6Hordijk P.L. ten Klooster J.P. van der Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Oomen L.C. Collard J.G. Science. 1997; 278: 1464-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). We are currently analyzing the roles of Tiam1 and other exchange factors in response to cadherin engagement. A large amount of information has been learned about the signaling pathways downstream from integrins. In contrast, cadherins have generally been considered to play a predominantly structural role, mediating strong cell-cell adhesion and providing a link for the actin cytoskeleton to the membrane at these sites of adhesion. Our finding here that cadherins themselves are receptors that signal to the Rho family of GTPases expands the repertoire of signaling pathways that cadherins initiate. It also contributes to the idea that many cell adhesion molecules signal to the Rho family of proteins, thereby relaying information from adhesion to the organization of the cytoskeleton.

Upon infliction of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs),1 ATM mediates the rapid induction of numerous cellular responses that lead to damage repair, and activation of cell cycle checkpoints and other survival pathways (reviewed in Refs. 1Rotman G.

The ATM gene is mutated in ataxia-telangiectasia, a pleiotropic autosomal recessive disorder characterized by progressive cerebellar degeneration, oculocutaneous telangiectasia, immunodeficiency, cancer predisposition, and an extreme sensitivity to ionizing radiation (IR). Cells derived from ataxia-telangiectasia patients exhibit chromosomal instability and a profound defect in all cellular responses to DSBs (reviewed in Refs. 3Lavin M.F. Shiloh Y. Annu. Rev.

Prominent examples of such substrates are the p53 protein, which mediates the G1/S checkpoint and repair processes; its inhibitor, Mdm2; the checkpoint kinase Chk2, which phosphorylates p53, Cdc25C, and Brca1, exerting control on the G1/S and G2/M checkpoints; and the Nbs1 protein, a component of the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 complex, which is involved in DSB repair and the activation of the S-phase checkpoint (5Shiloh Y.

Uziel et al., unpublished results.2T. Uziel et al., unpublished results. Previous studies based on biochemical and immunofluorescence analysis suggested that activation of ATM is not accompanied by a change in its abundance or subcellular distribution (11Lakin N.D.

Cell. 1998; 9: 2361-2374Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the amount of ATM and its activity do not vary during the cell cycle (14Gately D.P. Hittle J.C. Chan G.K.T. Yen T.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2361-2374Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 15Pandita T.K. Lieberman H.B. Lim D-S Dhar S. Zheng W. Taya Y. Kastan B.M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1386-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). ATM was shown to associate with the chromatin and the nuclear matrix (14Gately D.P. Hittle J.C. Chan G.K.T. Yen T.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2361-2374Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar); however, in that study the association was not altered following cellular exposure to IR. In addition, ATM was shown to bind DNA ends in vitro (16Smith G.C.M. Cary R.B. Lakin N.D. Hann B.C. Teo S-H. Chen D.J. Jackson S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 25571-25575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), but the in vivo implications of this finding remain unclear. ATM appears to play a critical role in the surveillance and/or early detection of DSBs but is probably not directly involved in the actual repair process (2Shiloh Y. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 2001; 65: 527-533Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 5Shiloh Y. Kastan M.B. Adv. Cancer Res. 2001; 83: 210-253Google Scholar). Thus, it is conceivable that only a fraction of ATM associates with sites of damage, while the remaining ATM molecules remain unbound and mask detection of the damage-associated fraction. In order to test this hypothesis, we designed a stepwise detergent extraction protocol aimed at fractionating ATM molecules according to their resistance to such extraction. Immunoblot analysis of these fractions showed that the majority of ATM was readily extracted. However, following exposure of the cells to DSB-inducing agents, a substantial fraction of the ATM pool was converted to a less extractable form within minutes after damage infliction. Immunostaining of cells extracted in situ showed that the extraction-resistant ATM was retained in nuclear aggregates. Colocalization of some of the retained ATM with foci of two proteins previously shown to occur at sites of DSBs, Nbs1 (18Maser R.S. Monsen K.J. Nelms B.E. Petrini J.H.J. Mol. Cell.

Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 905-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (1969) Google Scholar), point to the association of retained ATM with DSBs. The intensity and abundance of ATM aggregates and γ-H2AX foci increased with the levels of DNA damage, at a highly significant correlation. A striking correlation was also observed between the rate of appearance and dissolution of the two, suggesting a tight linkage between ATM retention and H2AX phosphorylation. HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Human lymphoblasts (C3ABR; a gift from M. Lavin) were grown in RPMI with 10% fetal bovine serum. All cells were grown in a humidified atmosphere, at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Exponentially growing cells were either mock-treated or treated with 10 grays of IR, 50 J/m2 of UVB light, 50 μmetoposide, or NCS (at the specified concentrations). Cells were left to recover at 37 °C and harvested at the indicated time points. The ATM-specific monoclonal antibody MAT3–4G10/8 was raised in mice according to standard procedures, against a synthetic peptide spanning amino acids 1967–1988 of murine Atm. This antibody recognizes both murine and human ATM and was used for immunoblot analysis. Immunofluorescence of ATM was carried out with the mouse monoclonal antibody 5C2 (a gift from E. Lee (University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX). A rabbit polyclonal antibody against Nbs1 (Ab-1; Oncogene Research Products, Cambridge, MA), was used for immunoblotting and immunofluorescence. A rabbit polyclonal Chk2-specific antibody was a gift from S. Elledge (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX). The rabbit polyclonal antibody recognizing γ-H2AX was a gift from W. Bonner (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Secondary antibodies for Western analysis, peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse, were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Secondary antibodies for immunofluorescence analysis were goat anti-mouse-conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes, Inc.) or donkey anti-rabbit conjugated to rhodamine (Jackson Immuno Research Laboratories). Treated or mock-treated cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and cell fractionation was carried out by four consecutive extractions with increasing detergent concentration. The clarified supernatant was collected at each step and labeled as fractions I–IV. Pellets of about 107 cells were first resuspended for 5 min on ice in 150 μl of fractionation buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) containing 0.2% Nonidet P-40 (Nonidet P-40), supplemented with protease inhibitors (5 μg/ml each pepstatin, leupeptin, and aprotonin) and phosphatase inhibitors (10 mm NaF, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 20 nmmicrocystin). Following centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min, the supernatant was collected (fraction I), and pellets were washed with the same buffer. The wash was collected as before (fraction II), and the nuclear pellets were further extracted for 40 min on ice with 150 μl of fractionation buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40. The extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 ×g for 15 min (fraction III). The pellets were finally lysed in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiled for 5 min (fraction IV). Equal aliquots of each fraction, derived from equivalent cell numbers, were separated on 8% SDS-PAGE gels and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Hybond-P; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Equal loading of fractions from treated and untreated samples was verified by staining the membranes with Ponceau S (Sigma). Membranes were blocked for 1 h in 5% dry milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (T-TBS) and incubated for 1 h with primary antibody diluted in T-TBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin. After three washes with T-TBS, membranes were incubated for 1 h with secondary antibodies in T-TBS containing 5% dry milk. Immunoblots were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Super Signal; Pierce). HeLa cells grown on 22-mm2 glass coverslips to about 70% confluence were untreated or treated with NCS. Unless otherwise noted, the NCS was present in the growth medium throughout the experiment. At the indicated time points, cell extraction was carried out in situ by incubating the coverslips in fractionation buffer (described above) containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 for 20 min on ice. The buffer was removed, and the procedure was repeated for two additional incubations on ice, of 10 and 5 min. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at 4 °C, followed by a 10-min incubation with 0.5% Triton X-100. After each step, the coverslips were rinsed three times with PBS. Intact cells (not extracted with Nonidet P-40) were fixed as described above. Coverslips were blocked for 15 min with 1% bovine serum albumin and 10% normal donkey serum in PBS. Primary antibodies were diluted in Primary Antibody Dilution Buffer (Biomeda Corp., Foster City, CA). Cells were incubated with primary antibody for 15 h at 4 °C, washed three times with PBS, and incubated with secondary antibody for 0.5 h at room temperature. Coverslips were washed three times in PBS and mounted using GelMount (Biomeda Corp.). All fluorescence images were obtained using a 410 Carl Zeiss confocal laser-scanning microscope (CLSM) at the following configuration: 25-milliwatt krypton/argon (488, 568 nm) laser lines. Images of the same antibody staining were obtained using the same CLSM parameters (brightness, contrast, pinhall, etc.). In order to increase image resolution, all images were processed by the application of deconvolution algorithms, using the maximum likelihood estimation with Huygens2 (Bitplane, Zurich, Switzerland) (21Holmes T.J. J. Opt. Soc. Am. A. 1992; 9: 1052-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Deconvolution was carried out on a UNIX-based Onyx work station (Silicon Graphics; Mountain View, CA). Colocalization analysis was performed on a gallery that included all of the treated cells using the Zeiss colocalization function. To quantify and compare the relative amount of retained ATM and γ-H2AX, we used the percentage of positive area (PPA) image analysis procedure (22Ronen D. Alstock M. Firon M. Mittelman L. Sobe T. Reseau J.H. Vande Woude G.F. Tsarfaty I. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 131-140PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, PPA was calculated as a ratio of the positive stained area to the total cellular area. The positive stained area was determined by measuring the fluorescence intensity of the image above a certain cut-off value that was determined based on the fluorescence intensity histogram for each antibody staining. Total cellular area was determined by measuring the fluorescence intensity above the surrounding background of the image, and it depicts the cellular autofluorescence. The statistical significance was calculated using regression analysis and the Student t test in Microsoft Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA). We designed a cellular fractionation procedure based on successive detergent extractions, aimed at removing loosely bound proteins (described under “Experimental Procedures”). Cells were briefly extracted with 0.2% Nonidet P-40- containing buffer, and the clarified cell extract was collected (fraction I). The cell pellet was washed once in the same buffer (fraction II). A longer extraction with 0.5% Nonidet P-40 was carried out on the remaining pellet (fraction III). Finally, the insoluble remains were boiled in electrophoresis sample buffer (fraction IV). Immunoblot analysis following SDS-PAGE of cell-equivalent aliquots of the four fractions (Fig. 1A) showed that the vast majority of the ATM pool was released at the early extraction steps (I and II). Further extraction after longer incubation with detergent (fractions III and IV) showed that only a small amount of ATM was left after the first two fractionation stages of untreated cells. In cells treated with NCS prior to fractionation, the amount of ATM in the extraction-resistant fractions (III and IV) was considerably higher (about 3–4-fold) than in the equivalent fractions of untreated cells (Fig. 1A), and a slight difference was already evident in fraction II. Quantitative analysis of the immunoblot demonstrated that about 20% of the ATM pool was retained in NCS-treated cells. Similar results were obtained when Triton X-100 was used instead of Nonidet P-40 or when the longer extraction (stages III and IV) was replaced by complete lysis in radioimmune precipitation buffer (data not shown). Retention of ATM after NCS treatment was also observed in human lymphoblasts (Fig. 1B). These results indicate that after induction of DNA damage, a subset of ATM molecules becomes more resistant to detergent extraction, suggesting that ATM is retained due to a tighter association with subnuclear components. The fractions analyzed in Fig. 1, A and B, were subjected to immunoblotting for other proteins involved in DSB repair. In each of the fractions, the relative amounts of Ku70, Ku80, DNA-PKcs, BLM, Rad50, and Mre11 were the same for NCS-treated and untreated cells (data not shown). When we used an antibody against Nbs1, a known substrate of ATM, slower migrating bands of Nbs1 appeared in fractions I and II in NCS-treated cells (Fig. 1, A and B). These bands had previously been shown to represent the phosphorylated forms of Nbs1 (23Gatei M. Young D. Cerosaletti K.M. Desai-Mehta A. Spring K. Kozlov S. Lavin M.F. Gatti R.A. Concannon P. Khanna K.K. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 24Lim D-S. Kim S-T. Xu B. Maser R.S. Lin J. Petrini J.H.J. Kastan M.B. Nature. 2000; 404: 613-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). Enrichment of a slow migrating form was seen in the extraction-resistant fraction (III and IV) of NCS-treated cells, concomitant with ATM retention (Fig. 1, A andB). Another substrate of ATM is the checkpoint kinase Chk2/hCds1 (27Ahn J.Y Schwarz J.K. Piwnica-Worms H. Canman C.E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5934-5936PubMed Google Scholar, 28Matsuoka S. Rotman G.

Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 762-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). In contrast to Nbs1 and the other DNA repair proteins mentioned above, neither the basal nor the phosphorylated form of Chk2 could be detected in fractions III or IV of NCS-treated or untreated cells (Fig. 1A). This observation indicates that all of Chk2 is readily extracted, in agreement with its role in the transduction of the signal rather than in detection or repair of the damage itself. ATM is activated by agents that generate DSBs, such as IR (9Canman C.E. Lim D-S. Cimprich K.A. Taya Y. Tamai K. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Kastan M.B. Siliciano J.D. Science. 1998; 281: 1677-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (1704) Google Scholar), the radiomimetic drug NCS (10Banin S. Moyal L. Shieh S.-Y. Taya Y. Anderson C.W. Chessa L. Smorodinsky N.I. Prives C. Reiss Y. Shiloh Y. Ziv Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1674-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (1704) Google Scholar), and the topoisomerase II inhibitor, etoposide.2 Other genotoxic agents such as UV light, which induces primarily pyrimidine dimers, do not enhance ATM activity (9Canman C.E. Lim D-S. Cimprich K.A. Taya Y. Tamai K. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Kastan M.B. Siliciano J.D. Science. 1998; 281: 1677-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (1704) Google Scholar). In agreement with this, ATM was found to mediate cellular responses to DSB-inducing agents but not other types of DNA-damaging agents (reviewed in Refs. 1Rotman G. Shiloh Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6135-6144Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar and 2Shiloh Y. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 2001; 65: 527-533Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We studied retention of ATM following treatment of HeLa cells with IR, NCS, etoposide, and UV-C light. In correlation with ATM activation by these agents, retention of ATM in fraction III was observed only in cells treated with DSB-inducing agents but not after UV irradiation, while there was no detectable change in the amount of loosely bound ATM in fraction I (Fig. 2). These observations indicate that nuclear retention of ATM is induced specifically by agents that generate DNA DSBs. Time course analysis of the extraction-resistant fraction (III) indicated that ATM was retained at the earliest time point examined, 3 min after the addition of NCS to HeLa cells (Fig.3A). No change could be observed in the amount of the loosely bound and major portion of the cellular ATM, detected in fraction I. Notably, the kinetics of Nbs1 phosphorylation was slower than that of ATM retention (Fig.3A). We next examined the dose dependence of ATM retention by detergent fractionation of HeLa cells at 10 min following exposure to increasing concentrations of NCS. As before, no NCS-induced changes could be observed in the loosely bound ATM that was extracted in fraction I. ATM retention (fraction III) was barely noticed at NCS doses of 20 and 50 ng/ml, but it increased proportionally with higher doses of 100–500 ng/ml (Fig. 3B). The antifungal agent wortmannin, a strong inhibitor of ATM (31Sarkaria J.N. Tibbets R.S. Busby E.C. Kennedy A.P. Hill D.E. Abraham R.T. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4375-4382PubMed Google Scholar), was used to investigate whether the kinase activity of ATM is required for its damage-induced nuclear retention. As expected, ATM-mediated phosphorylation of Nbs1 was inhibited by wortmannin at doses higher than 20 μm (Fig. 4). However, this agent had no effect on ATM retention at concentrations of up to 100 μm (Fig. 4). Our results indicate that ATM kinase activity in general, and its autophosphorylation in particular, are not needed for its nuclear retention. In order to visualize the retained ATM by immunofluorescence, we adapted a protocol for in situ detergent extraction of attached cells (see “Experimental Procedures”). In nonextracted cells, ATM was visible in the nuclei of untreated or NCS-treated cells, and no major NCS-induced alterations in the nuclear distribution of ATM could be detected (Fig. 5, A andB, top panels). Under these conditions, ATM showed diffuse nuclear staining with the exception of the nucleoli that were not stained. However, ATM was lost from the nuclei of untreated HeLa cells after extraction with Nonidet P-40 but was retained in extraction-resistant aggregates in NCS-treated cells (Fig. 5, A and B, bottom panels), in agreement with the results of the biochemical fractionation presented above. Thus, the removal of nucleoplasmic or loosely bound proteins, including the nonretained ATM, enabled clear detection of retained ATM in NCS-treated cells. Unexpectedly, the overall intensity of ATM staining in NCS-treated cells was roughly similar with or without in situ detergent extraction (compare the top and bottom panels in Fig. 5, A and B). This observation does not agree with the results of the biochemical analysis presented above, which showed that only about 20% of the ATM pool was retained after detergent fractionation of NCS-treated cells (Fig.1A). This apparent discrepancy could be attributed to enhanced accessibility of ATM to the antibody following in situ extraction with Nonidet P-40, perhaps due to exposure of relevant epitopes on the ATM protein. In order to further characterize the sites of ATM retention after DNA damage, we used an antibody specific for γ-H2AX, the phosphorylated form of histone H2AX on serine 139. Foci of γ-H2AX are formed specifically at sites of DNA DSBs, as early as 1 min after infliction of damage (20Rogakou E.P. Boon C. Redon C. Bonner W.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 905-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (1969) Google Scholar). Colocalization of some of the extraction-resistant ATM aggregates with foci of γ-H2AX (Fig.6A) indicated that part of the retained ATM is found at sites of DSBs. This notion was further supported by colocalization of retained ATM with Nbs1 (Fig.6B), since the Nbs1-Mre11-Rad50 complex was also shown to accumulate at sites of DSBs (18Maser R.S. Monsen K.J. Nelms B.E. Petrini J.H.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6087-6096Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 19Nelms B.J. Maser R.S. McKay J.F. Lagally M.G. Petrini J.H.J. Science. 1998; 280: 590-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar) and can be detected by in situ extraction at early time points after exposure to IR (30Mirzoeva O.K. Petrini J.H.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Extraction-resistant aggregates of ATM, visualized by in situ extraction followed by immunostaining, became more abundant with increasing NCS doses (Fig.7A). The number of γ-H2AX foci also increased with increasing levels of DNA damage, in agreement with previous observations (20Rogakou E.P. Boon C. Redon C. Bonner W.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 905-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (1969) Google Scholar), and these colocalized with the retained ATM (Fig. 7A). The dose dependence of the retained ATM was quantified by calculating the amount of ATM staining as PPA, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results of this analysis (Fig. 7B) show that the amount of ATM retained after detergent extraction and the amount of γ-H2AX increase proportionally to the concentration of NCS up to about 200 ng/ml, after which both level off. Regression analysis of the PPA showed that the curves fit a natural logarithmic pattern (γ-H2AX: y = 9.1989Ln(x) − 28.029, R2 = 0.9029; ATM: y = 10.895Ln(x) − 41.857,R2 = 0.9769). In order to follow the kinetics of the appearance and dissolution of retained ATM aggregates, HeLa cells were exposed to 200 ng/ml of NCS for 10 min. The formation of extraction-resistant ATM aggregates increased by 30-fold 30 min following treatment (p < 0.001; Fig. 8, A andB). Their levels decreased dramatically 60 min after treatment and plateaued at low levels by 3 h. Regression analysis of the PPA showed that the curves have a parabolic shape (γ-H2AX:y = −0.0254x2 + 1.6246x + 0.2574, R2 = 0.9989; ATM:y = −0.0314x2 + 2.0329x, R2 = 0.9982). This kinetics is in complete correlation with the appearance and dissolution of γ-H2AX foci in the same cells (Fig. 8, Aand B). These observations suggest that ATM retention and H2AX phosphorylation occur concomitantly, very rapidly after damage infliction, and decrease at the same rate thereafter. ATM plays a crucial role in the early and rapid activation of numerous responses necessary for cellular survival and preservation of genomic integrity following DSB induction. Extensive studies have recently revealed many of the players in the network of signaling pathways controlled by ATM (reviewed in Ref. 5Shiloh Y. Kastan M.B. Adv. Cancer Res. 2001; 83: 210-253Google Scholar). However, understanding its mechanism of action in response to DSBs has been hindered by the inability to detect changes in the abundance or nuclear distribution of ATM following DNA damage (11Lakin N.D. Weber P. Stankovic T. Rottinghous S.T. Taylor A.M.R. Jackson S.P. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2707-2716PubMed Google Scholar, 12Brown K.D. Ziv Y. Sadanandan S.N. Chessa L. Collins F.S. Shiloh Y. Tagle D.A.

Cell. 1998; 9: 2361-2374Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Using detergent extraction to remove loosely bound ATM, followed by immunoblotting and immunostaining, we obtained evidence of the dynamics in ATM subnuclear associations following DNA damage. Our observations suggest that while most of the ATM is loosely tethered to the nucleus, a subset of the ATM molecules becomes resistant to extraction immediately after induction of DSBs, probably due to their tighter association with sites of damage in the chromatin. Gately et al. (14Gately D.P. Hittle J.C. Chan G.K.T. Yen T.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2361-2374Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) reported that some of the ATM associates with chromatin and the nuclear matrix, but they observed no alterations in the associated fraction of ATM after IR treatment. The discrepancy between their and our results might stem from the different methods used for subcellular fractionation. In addition, they analyzed the ATM in each fraction by immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting, whereas we employed direct immunoblotting and immunostaining. Treatment of cells with wortmannin, an inhibitor of ATM and its relatives, the protein kinases ATR and DNA-PK (31Sarkaria J.N. Tibbets R.S. Busby E.C. Kennedy A.P. Hill D.E. Abraham R.T. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4375-4382PubMed Google Scholar) did not prevent NCS-induced retention of ATM. Thus, DSB-induced retention of ATM does not appear to involve ATM autophosphorylation or the phosphorylation of other proteins by these kinases. Visualization of retained ATM following DNA damage shows ATM staining as aggregates rather than foci. We cannot determine at this point whether these aggregates result from migration of nucleoplasmic ATM to sites of damage or from enhancement of a weak basal association of ATM with the chromatin and/or other subnuclear compartments. In situ fractionation was recently used to detect early nuclear retention of the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 complex in small granular foci (30Mirzoeva O.K. Petrini J.H.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). DNA damage-induced conversion to an extraction-resistant form was also reported for hRad9, another protein implicated in the early damage-sensing response (32Burtelow M.A. Kaufmann S.H. Karnitz L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26343-26348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Several proteins involved in DNA repair are recruited and accumulate in nuclear foci after double strand DNA breakage, in accordance with their active role in the repair of damage. These include the Rad51 protein (33Haaf T. Golub E. Reddy G. Radding C.M. Ward D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2298-2302Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar), the BRCA1 protein (34Scully R.S. Chen J. Ochs R.L. Keegan K. Hoekstra M. Feunteun J. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 425-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar), and the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 complex (18Maser R.S. Monsen K.J. Nelms B.E. Petrini J.H.J. Mol. Cell.

Science. 1998; 280: 590-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of histone H2AX on serine 139 and foci formation of the phosphorylated form, γ-H2AX, occur with very rapid kinetics. Rogakou et al. (20Rogakou E.P. Boon C. Redon C. Bonner W.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 905-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (1969) Google Scholar) reported that within seconds of damage infliction, H2AX molecules are phosphorylated en mass at sites of DSBs, and this is visualized as foci of γ-H2AX. A recent study suggested that H2AX phosphorylation and foci formation precede and initiate recruitment of repair factors to nuclear foci after DNA damage (35Paull T.T. Rogakou E.P. Yamazaki V. Kirchgessner C.U. Gellert M. Bonner W.M. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 886-895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1689) Google Scholar). ATM retention, like H2AX phosphorylation and foci formation, takes place at a rapid kinetics. We identified a remarkable correlation between the kinetics of appearance and dissolution of retained ATM and γ-H2AX, supporting our contention that there is a tight linkage between the induction of DSBs and ATM retention. Our observation that some but not all of the retained ATM is colocalized with γ-H2AX foci suggests that only part of the ATM molecules that increased their association with some nuclear components are bound to sites of DSBs. Thus, unlike the proteins that have an active role in the repair of the DNA breaks and accumulate en mass as foci at DSBs, only a subset of the ATM pool appears to rapidly associate with nuclear components, such as the chromatin and nuclear matrix, and can be found at sites of DSBs. These observations are in agreement with its role in damage surveillance and detection rather than in repair per se. Taken together, our observations indicate that while most of the cellular ATM is loosely tethered to the nucleus, a subset of ATM is rapidly retained, and some of it can be found at sites of DSBs. By anchoring to sites of damage in the chromatin, this fraction of the ATM pool might be the one directly involved in transducing the signal to downstream pathways. These observations underscore the role of ATM in DNA damage surveillance and early detection of DNA DSBs, followed by a rapid transduction of the signal to downstream pathways.

We have overexpressed Rad50 and Mre11 in yeast cells and purified them to near homogeneity. Consistent with the genetic data, we show that the purified Rad50 and Mre11 proteins form a stable complex. In the Rad50·Mre11 complex, the protein components exist in equimolar amounts. Mre11 has a 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity that results in the release of mononucleotides. The addition of Rad50 does not significantly alter the exonucleolytic function of Mre11. Using homopolymeric oligonucleotide-based substrates, we show that the exonuclease activity of Mre11 and Rad50·Mre11 is enhanced for substrates with duplex DNA ends. We have examined the endonucleolytic function of Mre11 on defined, radiolabeled hairpin structures that also contain 3′ and 5′ single-stranded DNA overhangs. Mre11 is capable of cleaving hairpins and the 3′ single-stranded DNA tail. These endonuclease activities of Mre11 are enhanced markedly by Rad50 but only in the presence of ATP. Based on these results, we speculate that the Mre11 nuclease complex may mediate the nucleolytic digestion of the 5′ strand at secondary structures formed upon DNA strand separation.

Haber J.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 349-404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Genetic studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae have been instrumental in the discovery of genes required for recombination and DSB1 repair through homologous recombination. These genes, RAD50,MRE11, XRS2, RAD51, RAD52,RAD54, RAD55, RAD57, RAD59, and RDH54/TID1, are collectively referred to as theRAD52 epistasis group (2Sung P. Trujillo K.M. Van Komen S. Mutat. Res. 2000; 451: 257-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). A number of studies in S. cerevisiae indicate that DSBs in homologous recombination events are processed in a nucleolytic fashion to generate an intermediate with overhanging 3′ ssDNA tails. The ssDNA tails are bound by Rad51 and other recombination factors, which function in concert to locate regions of homology on a corresponding DNA duplex (a homologous chromosome or sister chromatid) and form heteroduplex DNA joints (1Paques F. Haber J.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 349-404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Sung P. Trujillo K.M. Van Komen S. Mutat. Res. 2000; 451: 257-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). RAD50, MRE11, and XRS2 are involved in the nucleolytic processing of DSBs. Analysis of the Rad50 and Mre11 sequences reveals homology of these two proteins to Escherichia coli SbcC and SbcD, respectively (3Sharples G.J. Leach D.F.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 1215-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), which combine to form a complex that exhibits both exo- and endonuclease activities, including the capacity to cleave hairpin structures (4Connelly J.C. Kirkham L.A. Leach D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7969-7974Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Mre11 from human and yeast possesses exo- and endonuclease activities (5Furuse M. Nagase Y. Tsubouchi H. Murakami-Murofushi K. Shibata T. Ohta K.

Cell. 1998; 1: 969-979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Interestingly, overexpression of Rad50 and Mre11 can allow DNA synthesis to efficiently progress through DNA sequences with a propensity to form secondary structures, suggesting that the Mre11 complex in yeast might also have the ability to cleave such DNA structures (10Richard G.F. Goellner G.M. McMurray C.T. Haber J.E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2381-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). As evidenced by co-immunoprecipitation and two-hybrid experiments, Rad50, Mre11, and Xrs2 are associated in a complex (7Usui T. Ohta T. Oshiumi H. Tomizawa J. Ogawa H. Ogawa T. Cell. 1998; 95: 705-716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 11Johzuka K. Ogawa H. Genetics. 1995; 139: 1521-1532Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, the human counterparts of these proteins, human Rad50, Mre11, and NBS1 (the Xrs2 equivalent) have also been purified from human cells as an endogenous complex (8Trujillo K.M. Yuan S.S.F. Lee E.Y-H.P. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21447-21450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Remarkably, genetic evidence in S. cerevisiae implicates RAD50, MRE11, andXRS2 in other cellular functions including the formation of DSBs at meiotic recombination hotspots (1Paques F. Haber J.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 349-404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), non-homologous DNA end-joining, and the maintenance of telomere length (1Paques F. Haber J.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 349-404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Boulton S.J. Jackson S.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1819-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). More recently, Rad50 and Mre11 have been implicated in the adaptation to a Rad9/Rad17-mediated G2/M checkpoint after the introduction of an unrepairable DSB (13Lee S.E. Moore J.K. Holmes A. Umezu K. Kolodner R.D. Haber J.E. Cell. 1998; 94: 399-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). The multifunctional nature of the Rad50, Mre11, and Xrs2 trio emphasizes the importance for the biochemical characterization of these proteins, singly and in combination, for activities germane for their biological functions. Here, we purify Rad50 and Mre11, reconstitute the Rad50·Mre11 complex, and describe the endo- and exonucleolytic activities of these factors. We speculate on how the DNA structure-specific endonuclease activity of Rad50·Mre11 could be utilized to create ssDNA tails that facilitate subsequent steps in recombination, including the formation of dual Holliday junctions. TheRAD50 and MRE11 genes were introduced into the vector pPM231 containing the galactose-inducible hybridGAL-PGK promoter. The resulting plasmids, pR50.1 (2 μm, GAL-PGK-RAD50, LEU-2d) and pM11.1 (2 μm, GAL-PGK-MRE11, LEU-2d), were introduced into the protease-deficient strain BJ5464 (MATα ura3–52 trp1 leu2Δ1 his3Δ200 pep4::HIS3 prb1Δ1.6R can1). Cultures were grown overnight to the stationary phase in synthetic medium lacking leucine and diluted 8-fold into leucine dropout synthetic media with 3% glycerol, 3% lactic acid, and 2% galactose. After 24 h of growth at 30 °C, cells were harvested by centrifugation. All the steps were carried out at 0 to 4 °C. Typically, cells (50 g) expressing Rad50 were resuspended in 75 ml of cell breakage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% sucrose, 10 mm EDTA, 1.2 m KCl, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.01% Nonidet P-40) with protease inhibitors (5.0 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, chymostatin, pepstatin A, and 1 mm each phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and benzamidine) and lysed in a French press (SLM Aminco) at 20,000 p.s.i. The soluble fraction (Fraction I) was collected by ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g, 90 min) and treated with ammonium sulfate at 0.28 g/ml. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation (17,000 × g, 25 min), redissolved in 100 ml of K buffer (20 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, and 1.0 mm dithiothreitol) with protease inhibitors, and dialyzed against K buffer + 100 mm KCl. The dialysate (Fraction II) was applied to a 20-ml Q-Sepharose column, which was developed over a 200-ml gradient from 100 to 540 mm KCl, collecting 5.0-ml fractions. The peak fractions (about 350 mm KCl, Fraction III), as identified by Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-PAGE gels, were pooled and applied directly onto an 8.0-ml Affi-Gel Blue (Bio-Rad) column, which was developed with an 80-ml gradient from 100 to 1800 mm KCl, collecting 2.0-ml fractions. Peak elution occurred at about 1400 mm KCl, and these fractions were pooled (Fraction IV), dialyzed against K buffer + 100 mm KCl, and fractionated in a 6.0-ml macro-hydroxyapatite (Bio-Rad) column with a 50-ml gradient from 0 to 240 mm KH2PO4 in K buffer + 100 mm KCl, collecting 1.0-ml fractions. The peak fractions (∼175 mm KH2PO4, Fraction V) were pooled, concentrated in a Centricon 30 concentrator to 0.7 ml, and subjected to gel filtration on a 35-ml Sepharose 6B column in K buffer + 100 mm KCl. The peak of Rad50 (eluted at 16–22 ml, Fraction VI) was further purified in a 1.0-ml Mono Q column using a 40-ml gradient from 100 to 370 mm KCl, collecting 1.0-ml fractions. Rad50 (eluted at about 170 mm KCl, Fraction VII) was concentrated in a Centricon 30 microconcentrator to a final volume of 1.0 ml at 10 mg/ml. Rad50 was stored in small aliquots at −80 °C. The Rad50 protein concentration was determined by densitometric scanning of a 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel containing multiple loadings of purified Rad50 against known amounts of bovine serum albumin run on the same gel. All the steps were carried out at 0–4 °C. Typically, extract (Fraction I) was prepared from yeast cells (100 g) expressing Mre11 and subjected to ammonium sulfate precipitation at 0.28 g/ml. The resulting precipitate was dissolved in 130 ml of K buffer with protease inhibitors and dialyzed against K buffer + 100 mm KCl. The dialysate (Fraction II) was applied to a 25-ml Q-Sepharose column developed with a 250-ml gradient of 100–650 mm KCl, collecting 5.0-ml fractions. The peak fractions of Mre11 (∼300 mm KCl, Fraction III), as identified by Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-PAGE gels, were combined, bound to a 6.0-ml macro-hydroxyapatite column, and eluted with a gradient of 0–270 mm KH2PO4 in K buffer + 100 mm KCl. The Mre11 peak fractions from the macro-hydroxyapatite step (∼140 mmKH2PO4) were pooled (Fraction IV), concentrated using a Centricon 30 concentrator to ∼4.0 ml, and subjected to gel filtration on a 200-ml Sephacryl 300 column in K buffer + 100 mm KCl. Mre11-containing fractions (eluted at 90–120 ml, Fraction V) were loaded onto a 1.0-ml Mono S column, which was developed with a 40-ml KCl gradient from 100 to 630 mm KCl, with Mre11 eluting at about 300 mm KCl. The peak fractions (Fraction VI) were concentrated in a Centricon 30 microconcentrator to a final volume of 2.0 ml at 10 mg/ml. Purified Mre11 was stored at −80 °C in small aliquots. The Mre11 protein concentration was determined by densitometric scanning of a 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel containing multiple loadings of purified Mre11 against known amounts of bovine serum albumin run on the same gel. Fraction V Rad50 (15 mg) was mixed with Fraction V Mre11 (15 mg) in 4.0 ml and incubated on ice for 5 h to allow for complex formation. The Rad50·Mre11 complex was separated from free Mre11 by gel filtration on a 200-ml Sepharose 6B column equilibrated in K buffer + 100 mm KCl. Fractions were collected over a 200-ml volume, with the Rad50·Mre11 complex eluting at 80–100 ml. The Rad50·Mre11 complex was further purified on a 1.0-ml Mono S column with a 40-ml gradient (100–630 mm KCl), with the complex eluting at ∼200 mm KCl. The peak fractions were pooled and concentrated to a final volume of 1.0 ml at 10 mg/ml. Oligonucleotides were from Life Technologies, Inc. TP8 (9Paull T.T. Gellert M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 969-979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar), a 74-mer, had the sequence (5′-GACCTGGCACGTAGGACAGCATGGGATCTGGCCTGTGTTACACAGTGCTACAGACTGGAACAAAAACCCTGCAG-3′). TP9 (9Paull T.T. Gellert M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 969-979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar), also a 74-mer, was the exact complement of TP8. TP8E (73-mer) was identical to TP8, except for the absence of the 3′ G residue. T74 consisted of 74 T residues, and A74 consisted of 74 A residues. HP2 (56-mer) had the sequence 5′-AAAAAAGACCTGGCACGTAGGACAGCAGCTGCTGTCCTACGTGCCAGGTCAAAAAA-3′, and last, HP30 (84-mer) had the sequence 5′-AAAAAAGACCTGGCACGTAGGACAGCAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATGCTGTCCTACGTGCCAGGTCAAAAAA-3′. These oligonucleotides were purified on 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gels containing 7.0 m urea and 20% formamide run at 55 °C in 100 mm Tris borate, pH 8.0, and 2.0 mm EDTA (TBE). The oligonucleotides were electroeluted from gel slices, dialyzed against water, and concentrated in Centricon 10 microconcentrators. The single-stranded oligonucleotide ladder used as size markers was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. DNA hairpin substrates were prepared by labeling HP2 and HP30 at the 3′ end with terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase and [α-32P]ddATP. The labeled oligos were held at 70 °C for 10 min and then allowed to cool slowly to room temperature to anneal. The annealed product was further purified on a 10% native polyacrylamide gel in TBE at 4 °C and recovered by electroelution. The 5′ end-labeled duplex substrates were made by hybridizing oligo TP8 (10 μg) radiolabeled at the 5′ end with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP to oligo TP9 (15 μg) held at 70 °C in 30 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.0, with 200 mm KCl for 10 min, which was allowed to slowly cool to room temperature. Substrate concentrations were determined by titration on a 10% native polyacrylamide gel in TBE against known amounts of DNA standards and by scintillation counting. The 3′ end-labeled duplex substrates were generated by the hybridization of oligo TP8E to TP9 and subsequent filling-in of the resulting single-base overhang with the exonuclease-deficient Klenow polymerase and [α-32P]dGTP. The labeling reaction was halted by phenol/chloroform extraction followed by gel filtration in Biospin P-6 columns (Bio-Rad) to remove the unincorporated isotope. TP8, T74, and A74 were labeled at the 3′ end with terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase and [α-32P]dATP or [α-32P]dTTP where indicated. TP8A* indicates that the TP8 substrate (74-mer) was labeled at the 3′ end with an A, and TP8T* indicates 3′-labeling with a T. For these reactions, a molar excess of oligonucleotide to isotope was used to minimize the possibility that multiple bases were added to a single oligonucleotide. The T*A hybrid was obtained by hybridizing T74T* to A74. Various DNA substrates were mixed with Mre11 or Rad50·Mre11 complex (amounts indicated in figure legends) in reaction buffer (30 mm BisTris-HCl, pH 7.0, with 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MnCl2, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1.0 mm dithiothreitol). ATP or ATPγS (1.0 mm) were also added when stated. After incubation at 37 or 4 °C where indicated, the reaction was halted by 1/10 volume of 3% SDS and deproteinized with proteinase K (0.5 mg/ml) at 37 °C for 10 min. For oligonucleotide-based nuclease assays, one-third volume of 90% formamide with 0.05% bromphenol blue was added to each sample, which was boiled for 2 min before loading 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gels containing 7 m urea and 20% formamide in 100 mm Tris borate, pH 8.0, and 2.0 mm EDTA (TBE). After electrophoresis, the gels were fixed in 10% acetic acid, 10% methanol, dried, and subjected to autoradiography and phosphorimage analysis. Portions of the exonuclease reactions were loaded onto polyethyleneimine plates (J. T. Baker Inc.), which were developed in 1.0 mformic acid and 0.3 m LiCl2. Reaction products were visualized by autoradiography and quantitated by phosphorimage analysis. SDS-PAGE analysis of extracts from yeast cells harboring the Rad50 expression plasmid (pR50.1) and the empty expression vector (pPM231) revealed the Rad50 protein band clearly. The observed size of the overexpressed Rad50 protein (150 kDa) (Fig. 1 A,left panel) was in agreement with the predicted molecular mass for this protein (14Raymond W.E. Kleckner N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3851-3856Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). By immunoprecipitation, we have verified that Rad50 in wild type extract has the same gel size as the overexpressed protein. Rad50 was purified (Fig. 1 A,middle panel) to near homogeneity (Fig. 1 A,right panel). Likewise, comparison of extracts from yeast cells harboring the Mre11 expression plasmid, pM11.1, versus pPM231 showed the overexpression of Mre11 (Fig. 1 B, left panel). The apparent gel size of ∼94 kDa for Mre11 was larger than the predicted size of 78 kDa for this protein (11Johzuka K. Ogawa H. Genetics. 1995; 139: 1521-1532Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By immunoprecipitation, we have verified that the overexpressed Mre11 had the same gel size as Mre11 from wild type extract. Mre11 was also purified (Fig.1 B, middle panel) to near homogeneity (Fig.1 B, right panel). When partially purified Rad50 and Mre11 were mixed on ice and applied to a Sepharose 6B gel filtration column, the Mre11 profile was shifted to co-elute with Rad50 as a higher molecular weight species (not shown), suggesting that Rad50 and Mre11 formed a stable complex. Interestingly, whereas Rad50 alone did not bind to a Mono S column, it was efficiently retained after incubation with Mre11, which binds to Mono S, thus providing additional evidence that these proteins form a stable complex. For biochemical studies, the Rad50·Mre11 complex was assembled and purified to near homogeneity as described under “Experimental Procedures” and found to consist of equimolar amounts of the two proteins (Fig. 1 C, right panel). Neither the addition of ATP nor Mn2+ had any detectable effect on complex stability (not shown). To examine the exonuclease activity of Mre11 and the Rad50·Mre11 complex, the 5′-labeled duplex (5′-Duplex) and the 3′-labeled duplex (3′-Duplex) substrates were used. Aside from the location of the 32P label, the 5′-Duplex and the 3′-Duplex shared the same DNA sequence. To follow the kinetics more accurately, the experiment was carried out at 4 °C. Digestion of the 5′-Duplex by either Mre11 or the Rad50·Mre11 complex as a function of time generated a variety of radiolabeled products of decreasing size (Fig. 2 A). By contrast, digestion of the 3′-Duplex generated a single major product that migrated at the gel front (Fig. 2 B). These results confirmed that the exonuclease activity of Mre11 is 3′ to 5′ in polarity. Likewise, the Rad50·Mre11 complex exhibited a 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity. In contrast to human Rad50, which stimulated the exonuclease activity of human Mre11 3–4-fold (9Paull T.T. Gellert M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 969-979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar), yeast Rad50 appears to have no significant effect on the exonuclease activity of Mre11. The exonuclease product generated by the digestion of the 3′-Duplex by Mre11 and Rad50·Mre11 was a mononucleotide, as determined by comparison to the mobility of the mononucleotide product generated by the dsDNA-specific 3′ to 5′ Exonuclease III from E. coli by thin layer chromatography (Fig. 3) and on polyacrylamide gels (not shown).Figure 3The exonuclease activity of Mre11 and the Rad50·Mre11 (R/M) complex is dependent on Mn2+. The exonuclease activity of Mre11 and Rad50·Mre11 on the 3′ Duplex was monitored in the presence of Mg2+ or Mn2+, as shown. Reactions were carried out as described in Fig. 2 for 2 min and were analyzed by thin layer chromatography. GMP and the reaction products generated by exonuclease III were run as standards. GMP*, guanosine monophosphate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The exonuclease activity of Mre11 and Rad50·Mre11 required Mn2+ (Fig. 3), which could not be substituted by Mg2+, Ca2+, Zn2+, or Co2+ (not shown). As expected, the exonuclease activity of Mre11 was unaffected by ATP or ATPγS. Interestingly, whereas ATP was clearly not a requirement for the Rad50·Mre11 exonuclease function, ATPγS caused partial inhibition (Fig.4, A and B). For example, whereas ∼73% of the labeled nucleotide was released from the duplex by Rad50·Mre11 with or without ATP in 2 min, only ∼36% was liberated in the presence of ATPγS (Fig. 4, A andB). These results indicated that the ATPγS-bound form of Rad50·Mre11 is less active exonucleolytically. Other results indicated that Rad50 and the Rad50·Mre11 complex possessed only a low level of ATPase activity with k cat values of 0.10 min−1 and 0.12 min−1 at 37 °C, respectively. The exonuclease activity of Mre11 and Rad50·Mre11 was maximal from pH 6.4 to 7.2 and was considerably less active above pH 7.6. As expected, Rad50 alone was devoid of any exonuclease activity (not shown). We next examined whether Mre11 and Rad50·Mre11 also acted exonucleolytically on ssDNA. For this purpose, oligonucleotide TP8 was labeled at the 3′ end with either an A or T residue, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Incubation of these substrates with Rad50·Mre11 (Fig. 5 A) or Mre11 (not shown) resulted in the release of the32P-labeled nucleotides as observed for the 3′-Duplex substrate. This result was in agreement with the observation of Usuiet al. (7Usui T. Ohta T. Oshiumi H. Tomizawa J. Ogawa H. Ogawa T. Cell. 1998; 95: 705-716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). However, we also wished to consider the possibility that hybridization of the ssDNA end in TP8 to short complementary sequences within the oligonucleotide substrate or between different TP8 molecules might transiently generate a duplex end for the Rad50·Mre11 exonuclease function to act upon. To examine this, we labeled the homopolymeric oligonucleotides T74 and A74, consisting of a run of 74 T or A residues, at the 3′ end with a labeled T or A residue, respectively. Such substrates should be largely devoid of secondary structure. As shown in Fig. 5 B, Rad50·Mre11 had little ability to digest these homopolymers. Importantly, the hybrid generated by the radiolabeled T74T* substrate with the unlabeled A74 substrate (T*A Hybrid) was now digested by Rad50·Mre11 exonucleolytically (Fig.5 B), albeit less extensively than the 3′-Duplex (Fig.2 B). We attribute this difference to the fact that the TA Hybrid is likely a population of annealed products, some of which have persistent ssDNA overhangs or have the radiolabeled end embedded in concatamers, thus preventing the labeled end from degradation. Similar results were obtained using Mre11 alone (data not shown) and with another unrelated enzyme, exonuclease III, which is a known dsDNA-specific 3′ to 5′ exonuclease (Fig. 5 C). Taken together, the results demonstrated that the exonuclease activity of Mre11 and Rad50·Mre11 has a clear preference for duplex DNA ends and that digestion of the TP8 oligonucleotides as initially observed was likely enhanced by transient base-pairing events that generated duplex DNA ends. Both Mre11 (5Furuse M. Nagase Y. Tsubouchi H. Murakami-Murofushi K. Shibata T. Ohta K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6412-6425Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 6Moreau S. Ferguson J.R. Symington L.S.

Cell. 1998; 95: 705-716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) and Rad50·Mre11 (data not shown) were capable of digesting circular plasmid-length ssDNA to products of higher gel mobility, indicating the action of an endonuclease. The fact that neither Mre11 nor Rad50·Mre11 cleaved a homopolymeric oligonucleotide endonucleolytically (Fig. 5 B) suggested that they might be acting on secondary structures within the ssDNA substrate. Therefore, it was of considerable interest to examine the endonucleolytic function on defined hairpin substrates that mimic structures expected in the ssDNA molecule. Difficulties in discerning endo- versus exonuclease activities on such substrates were overcome by the inclusion of a homopolymeric poly(dA) tail at the ends of the hairpins, guided by our observation that such homopolymers were relatively resistant to exonucleolytic cleavage (Fig. 5 B). Interestingly, both Mre11 and Rad50·Mre11 were capable of making specific incisions resulting in the creation of two major endonucleolytic products, designated A and B. Product A was the result of an incision at the distal end of the hairpin relative to the 3′-labeled extremity. Importantly, as determined by analysis of reaction products on sequencing gels, the relative position of the incision remained the same regardless of whether a fully paired hairpin (HP2) or a hairpin with a 30-base homopolymeric loop (HP30) was used (Fig. 6). Product B resulted from another incision at the junction of the duplex with the 3′ ssDNA poly(dA) overhang (Fig. 6). Owing to the higher temperature (37 °C) and increased incubation times (10–40 min) employed for these experiments compared with the conditions (4 °C and 0.5–2.0 min) used to examine the exonuclease activity of the homopolymeric substrates in Fig.5 B, a modest amount of mononucleotide (AMP*) was observed (Fig. 6). We addressed the question of whether ATP was important for the structure-specific endonucleolytic function of Mre11 and Rad50·Mre11. In the absence of ATP, Rad50·Mre11 was very similar to Mre11 with regard to overall endonuclease activity (Fig.7, lanes 5 and 11). However, in the presence of ATP, the endonuclease activity of the Rad50·Mre11 complex was greatly enhanced, whereas that of Mre11 was unaffected (Fig. 7, lanes 3 and 9). For instance, whereas only 11% of HP2 was converted to products A and B by Rad50·Mre11 after 40 min in the absence of ATP (Fig. 7, lane 11), ∼52% was converted into these products when ATP was present (Fig. 7, lane 9). Importantly, ATPγS did not stimulate the endonuclease activity of Rad50·Mre11 (Fig. 7,lanes 6 and 12), nor did ATPγS have any influence on the endonucleolytic function of Mre11. As expected, the structure-specific endonuclease activities had a specific requirement for Mn2+ as cofactor (Fig. 7). Mre11 and Rad50·Mre11 exhibit dsDNA exonuclease activity with a 3′ to 5′ polarity that releases mononucleotide products. Although neither Mre11 nor Rad50·Mre11 are significantly stimulated by ATP for its exonuclease function, the activity of Rad50·Mre11 is inhibited by ATPγS. Interestingly, whereas hRad50 has been shown to stimulate the exonuclease activity of human Mre11 (9Paull T.T. Gellert M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 969-979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar), we find that S. cerevisiae Rad50 does not appear to significantly affect the exonuclease activity of S. cerevisiae Mre11. We also demonstrate that Mre11 with or without Rad50 has a clear preference for duplex DNA ends. The apparent ability of Mre11 to digest ssDNA substrates as seen by Usui et al.(7Usui T. Ohta T. Oshiumi H. Tomizawa J. Ogawa H. Ogawa T. Cell. 1998; 95: 705-716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) was likely enhanced by the formation of transient duplex ends within the oligonucleotide substrates. Based on our finding that the exonuclease activity of Mre11 was attenuated by homopolymeric ssDNA sequences, we designed hairpin structures with poly(dA) extensions to allow us to discern the endonuclease function. Using this approach, we were able to observe two distinct endonucleolytic activities within hairpin substrates. One of the endonucleolytic products was formed upon cleavage at the distal end of a hairpin loop relative to the labeled 3′ end. The second major endonucleolytic product was formed upon cleavage at the junction between the duplex DNA molecule and the 3′ ssDNA extension. Although Mre11 was capable of making both incisions alone, Rad50 stimulated these activities markedly, but ATP was specifically required for the maximal expression of the endonucleolytic activities of only the Rad50·Mre11 complex. Similar DNA structure-specific endonuclease activities were first reported by Paull and Gellert (15Paull T.T. Gellert M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1276-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar) for the human Mre11 protein, but our current results point to two major differences concerning how these endonucleolytic activities in the yeast and human counterparts are regulated. Specifically, whereas the ability to incise a fully paired DNA hairpin and a 3′ ssDNA tail for hMre11 is largely dependent on both the human Rad50 and NBS1 proteins (15Paull T.T. Gellert M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1276-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar), S. cerevisiae Rad50 alone is sufficient to stimulate these activities in yeast Mre11, although it remains possible that Xrs2 may further enhance the endonucleolytic function of Rad50·Mre11. Second, although the incision of a 3′ ssDNA tail but not a DNA hairpin by the human Rad50·Mre11·NBS1 complex requires ATP, the yeast Rad50·Mre11 complex needs ATP for the maximal expression of both structure-specific activities. Results from a number of genetic studies in S. cerevisiae indicate that during DSB processing, the DNA strands that contain the 5′ termini are resected preferentially (1Paques F. Haber J.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 349-404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Given this observation, it is clear that the Mre11 exonuclease activity, which has a 3′ to 5′ directionality, cannot be solely responsible for the resection of the 5′ DNA strands. Like its human counterpart, yeast Mre11 also possesses the ability to incise DNA hairpin structures as well as 3′ ssDNA tails that border a duplex region. The highly conserved nature of these endonucleolytic activities suggests that they are germane for the processing of DNA DSBs. We speculate that these DNA structure-specific activities may be used in conjunction with a DNA helicase to process DNA double-strand breaks. The engagement of the DNA ends by the Rad50·Mre11·Xrs2 complex and recruitment of a DNA helicase would lead to catalytic unwinding of the two DNA strands, creating 3′ and 5′ single-stranded overhangs (Fig.8 A, Step I). We also surmise that this helicase may be activated by a ssDNA region generated by the 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity of the complex or through the limited capacity of Rad50 to partially unwind duplex DNA (15Paull T.T. Gellert M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1276-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). As postulated in Fig. 8 A, the endonucleolytic function of the Rad50·Mre11·Xrs2 complex may recognize and incise secondary structures present in the DNA strands that harbor the 5′ termini of the DNA break (Fig. 8 A, Step II). This hypothetical model (Fig. 8) resembles the mode of DSB processing in E. coli, during which the ends of DSBs are acted upon by the integrated helicase/nuclease action of the RecBCD protein complex (16Camerini-Otero R.D. Hsieh P. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1995; 29: 509-552Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The end result of such a mode of processing would in fact create not only a 3′ ssDNA tail but also a shorter 5′ ssDNA tail as well (Fig.8 A, Step III). Given that Rad51 can efficiently utilize both 3′ and 5′ ssDNA tails for DNA joint formation (17Mazin A.V. Zaitseva E. Sung P. Kowalczykowski S.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1148-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), the DNA intermediate depicted in Fig. 8 A (III) is ideally suited for the formation of double Holliday junctions (Fig.8 B) known to exist during meiotic recombination (1Paques F. Haber J.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 349-404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At this time, we can only speculate as to the reason(s) why secondary structures within the 3′ strand are not also acted upon by the Rad50·Mre11·Xrs2 complex. Genetic and biochemical evidence clearly indicates that either the 3′ strand is protected or that the 5′ strand is preferentially excised. We suggest that the 3′ ssDNA generated as result of the helicase action might be subject to preferential binding by a variety of proteins that would, in turn, function to protect the 3′ ssDNA tail and/or melt the secondary structures that might otherwise be susceptible to the action of Rad50·Mre11·Xrs2. Among such protein factors might be RPA, Rad51, and other recombination factors that have been shown to localize to the site of a DSB (18Liu Y. Li M. Lee E.Y. Maizels N. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 975-978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 19Liu Y. Maizels N. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 20MacPhail S.H. Olive P.L. Radiat. Res. 2001; 155: 672-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We wish to emphasize that the proposed model is suggestive and must be validated experimentally. Point mutations that render Mre11 nuclease deficient cause no apparent anomalies in DSB processing in mitotic cells. We would imagine that the most important role of the Rad50·Mre11·Xrs2 complex in end-processing in such instances is to recruit a DNA helicase to the DSB. Once a branched DNA structure is generated as a result of catalytic DNA strand separation by the helicase (Fig.8 A, Step II), the fact that nuclease-deficient mutants of Mre11 are still capable of DSB processing (21Symington L.S. Kang L.E. Moreau S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4649-4656Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) would argue that the 5′ ssDNA strand in the branched structure is also eventually accessible to other nucleases, as suggested by the work of Symington et al. (21Symington L.S. Kang L.E. Moreau S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4649-4656Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It has been shown that in the absence of Mre11, DNA ends can still be processed, perhaps by a dsDNA exonuclease (21Symington L.S. Kang L.E. Moreau S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4649-4656Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, the low processivity of 5′ strand resection in such instances is evidenced by highly reduced conversion tract lengths (21Symington L.S. Kang L.E. Moreau S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4649-4656Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This observation strongly implicates the Rad50· Mre11·Xrs2-dependent pathway as the preferred mechanism for DSB processing in wild type cells.

Xanthophyll binding to the V1 site can be preserved upon solubilization of the chloroplast membranes with the mild detergent dodecyl-α-d-maltoside, while an IEF purification step completely removes the ligand. Surprisingly, spectroscopic analysis showed that when bound in this site, xanthophylls are unable to transfer absorbed light energy to chlorophyll a.

Electron crystallography and mutation analysis showed that each Lhcb1 subunit contains five Chl aand four Chl b binding sites, while three additional sites can bind either Chl a or Chl b. Chlorophyll ligands are amino acid side chains belonging to three trans-membrane α-helices or to neighbor Chl (2Kühlbrandt W. Wang D.N. Fujiyoshi Y.

Within the pigment-protein complex are also located two carotenoid binding sites, called L1 and L2, cross-bracing helices A and B. These sites are occupied by lutein (L1) and by lutein (80%) and violaxanthin (20%) (L2) (4Croce R. Weiss S. Bassi R. J. Biol.

Xanthophylls in sites L1, L2, and N1, are tightly bound to the complex even in very harsh conditions of purification. In addition, violaxanthin can be bound to LHCII when isolated by mild detergent treatment, while the interaction does not survive further purification steps, such as IEF, suggesting loose binding (7Ruban A.V.

Biol. 1999; 50: 333-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar). Excess energy dissipation is catalyzed by the nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ) mechanism, whose full expression depends on the de-epoxidation of violaxanthin to antheraxanthin and zeaxanthin (VAZ) by violaxanthin de-epoxidase, which is activated by low luminal pH (13Yamamoto H.Y.

Although it is generally accepted that NPQ is developed in the Lhc antenna system, the identity of the actual protein subunit catalyzing the energy dissipation reaction is still a matter of debate. The minor Lhc proteins CP29, CP26, and CP24 have been proposed as candidates for a primary role in NPQ (14Sandona D. Croce R. Pagano A. Crimi M. Bassi R. Biochim. Biophys.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2233-2239Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), violaxanthin loosely bound to LHCII may constitute the larger pool of this pigment in the thylakoid membrane and possibly the most readily available one for the xanthophyll cycle. It was suggested that the de-epoxidation state of the loosely bound VAZ could induce aggregation quenching by eliciting a conformational change in LHCII (7Ruban A.V. Lee P.J. Wentworth M. Young A.J. Horton P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10458-10465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In this work, we report on the characteristics of the fourth xanthophyll binding site of LHCII, with the aim of understanding its function in the PSII light harvesting system. We found that violaxanthin is loosely bound to LHCII in a specific site, hereafter called the V1 site. Surprisingly, when bound to site V1, violaxanthin is not active in light harvesting. Also, its de-epoxidation to zeaxanthin does not produce fluorescence quenching or any detectable spectral differences which could suggest conformational changes. Possible functions of the V1 site are discussed. Zea mays (cv. Dekalb DK300) plants were grown after germination until an height of 10–15 cm at 23 °C at low light intensities (∼80 μE, 14 h light/10 h dark). One set of plants was light-stressed at about 1000 μE m−2 s−1 for 2 h 30 min at 4 °C while control plants were maintained at growth conditions. Thylakoid were isolated immediately after the light stress as described (25Bassi R. Rigoni F. Barbato R. Giacometti G.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 936: 29-38Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Membranes corresponding to 500 μg of Chl were washed with 5 mm EDTA and then solubilized in 1 ml of 0.6% dodecyl-α-d-maltoside (α-DM), 10 mmHepes, pH 7.5, by vortexing for 1 min. The solubilized samples were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min to eliminate unsolubilized material and then fractionated by ultracentrifugation in a 0.1–1 m sucrose gradient containing 0.06% α-DM and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5 (22 h at 280,000 × g at 4 °C). The green bands of the sucrose gradient were harvested with a syringe. Trimeric LHCII, isolated from control plants, was further purified by flatbed preparative IEF as previously described (26Dainese P. Hoyer-Hansen G. Bassi R. Photochem. Photobiol. 1990; 51: 693-703Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Green bands eluted from the gel were then fractionated by ultracentrifugation in a 15–40% glycerol gradient containing 0.06% β-DM (6 h at 480,000 × g at 4 °C), yielding three bands: free pigments, LHCII monomers, and LHCII trimers. The pigment composition of the complexes was analyzed by fitting the absorption spectrum of the acetone extract with the spectra of individual pigments (27Connelly J.P. Müller M.G. Bassi R. Croce R. Holzwarth A.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and by HPLC analysis (28Gilmore A.M. Yamamoto H.Y. Plant Physiol. 1991; 96: 635-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). SDS-6 m urea PAGE was performed with the Tris-sulfate buffer system as previously reported (29Bassi R. Machold O. Simpson D. Carlsberg Res. Commun. 1985; 50: 145-162Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Deconvolution of the Soret region of the spectra of native complexes into individual pigment components was performed as previously reported (30Croce R. Cinque G. Holzwarth A.R. Bassi R. Photosynth. Res. 2000; 64: 221-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Absorption spectra were obtained using a SLM-Aminco DW-2000 spectrophotometer at room temperature. Samples were in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.06% DM, 20% glycerol at 10 μg/ml Chl concentration. Fluorescence spectra were recorded at room temperature using a Jasco FP-777 spectrofluorimeter. Bandwidth was 3 nm for both excitation and emission. The Chl concentration was 0.1 μg/ml. The LD spectra were recorded upon sample orientation of the particles by the polyacrylamide squeezing technique according to Ref. 31Haworth P. Arntzen C.J. Tapie P. Breton J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 679: 428-435Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar. Chlorophyll fluorescence quenching experiments were carried out as described in Ref. 32Ruban A.V. Horton P. Photosynth. Res. 1994; 40: 181-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar but using a Chl concentration of 0.1 μg/ml. The samples were diluted to an absorbance of 0.6 at the maximum in the Qy region. The protein was than illuminated with white light (4500 μE m−2s−1) from a halogen lamp. After each time interval, the cuvette was removed from the light source, and the absorption spectrum was recorded in the range 600–750 nm. In order to check conditions for maintaining the highest xanthophyll binding level in LHCII complex, we solubilized thylakoid membranes with a series of alkyl-sugar detergents including dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, dodecyl-α-d-maltoside, octyl-β-d-glucoside, decyl-β-d-glucoside, and nonyl-β-d-glucoside and fractionated the solubilized material by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation including each detergent slightly above its critical micellar concentration in the gradient. In each case, a green band was obtained at about 0.3m sucrose upon ultracentrifugation for 22 h at 40,000 × g in an SW40 Beckman rotor, which contained pure LHCII as judged from SDS-PAGE, absorption spectra, and HPLC analysis. In each case, the Chl a/b ratio was close to 1.5, and the Chl/neoxanthin and Chl/lutein ratios were about 13 and 6, respectively. The Chl/violaxanthin ratio ranged between 50 and 18, indicating that each detergent had a different capacity of removing violaxanthin from LHCII. The best results were obtained with dodecyl-α-d-maltoside solubilization, which yielded the highest violaxanthin content. This detergent was thus utilized for purification of LHCII through this study. Fig. 1 A (left) shows a sucrose gradient loaded with solubilized thylakoids from control plants following ultracentrifugation. Six bands were obtained, the highest one being yellow, while bands 2–6 were green ordark green. SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig.1 B) showed that upper band only contained polypeptides of 33- and 23-kDa apparent molecular mass that were recognized by immunoblotting with OEE antisera, thus suggesting that these uncolored polypeptides co-migrated in the gradient with free carotenoids in detergent micelles. Carotenoids in this band accounted for 6% of the total carotenoids recovered from the bands in the sucrose gradient. HPLC analysis revealed traces of Chl accounting for less than 1% of total chlorophyll in the gradient (see TableI). According to previous results with dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (22Dainese P. Bassi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8136-8142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), band 2 contained the minor Lhc proteins CP29, CP26, and CP24 as well as LHCII polypeptides, indicating that a small fraction of the LHCII trimeric complex dissociated into products co-migrating with monomeric minor Lhcs. Band 3 contained trimeric LHCII, and its properties will be described in detail below. Band 4 was the fainter band and contained the supramolecular antenna complex composed of CP29-CP24-LHCII trimer previously described (33Bassi R. Dainese P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 317-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Band 5 contained the PSII core complex binding Chl a and β-carotene, while band 6 contained the PSI-LHCI complex as suggested by its polypeptide composition and by the Qy absorption peak red-shifted to 680 nm. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that LHCII polypeptides were only present in bands 4, 3, and 2 when in their supramolecular, trimeric, and monomeric forms, respectively.Table IPercentage of pigments in the six bands of the sucrose gradientSampleNVAZLb-CChl bChlaCar totVAZ%%%%%%%%%%C.10.090.620.010.000.580.250.060.591.550.62C.20.921.050.040.001.790.104.499.563.911.09C.32.521.840.030.005.510.0013.2820.269.901.87C.40.190.230.020.000.460.061.152.020.960.25C.50.000.160.000.000.231.210.158.711.610.16C.60.081.360.270.001.805.083.1536.578.581.63S.10.070.150.140.470.720.280.070.721.830.76S.20.910.690.150.381.750.114.489.744.001.23S.32.450.530.670.355.580.0012.7519.519.571.55S.40.210.150.040.040.500.081.252.291.020.23S.50.000.030.050.050.211.120.157.441.470.13S.60.071.030.420.251.805.593.2238.379.151.69The data are normalized considering 100 the sum of the Chls in the six bands.

The characteristics of LHCII from band 3 are as follows. The Chl a/bratio was 1.53, the Chl/carotenoid ratio was 3.4, the Chl/lutein ratio was 6.1, the Chl/neoxanthin ratio was 13.3, and the Chl/violaxanthin ratio was 18.2. Recent work showed that each LHCII polypeptide tightly binds 12 Chl molecules and xanthophylls, namely 1.8 lutein, 0.2 violaxanthin, and 1.0 neoxanthin (3Remelli R. Varotto C. Sandona D. Croce R. Bassi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33510-33521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 4Croce R. Weiss S. Bassi R. J. Biol.

It is evident that violaxanthin and lutein content in LHCII from sucrose band 3 is strongly increased with respect to both recombinant LHCII (4Croce R. Weiss S. Bassi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29613-29623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) and highly purified LHCII (15Bassi R. Pineau B. Dainese P. Marquardt J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Assuming 12 Chl per polypeptide (2Kühlbrandt W. Wang D.N. Fujiyoshi Y.

Chem. 1991; 266: 8136-8142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) a xanthophyll content of 3.5 molecules per polypeptide is obtained. However, this figure it is not fully convincing, since it implies a content in neoxanthin lower than expected (0.9 versus 1.0 mol per polypeptide). By assuming for LHCII trimer from sucrose gradient a neoxanthin content as in recombinant and highly purified LHCII, a pigment complement of 13 Chl, 2.1 lutein, 1.0 neoxanthin, and 0.7 violaxanthin per polypeptide is obtained, implying that loosely bound xanthophylls account for 0.5 violaxanthin and 0.3 lutein molecules per LHCII polypeptide (TableII).Table IIPigment to protein stoichiometry determination of LHCII-CCar/monL/monN/monV/monChl/monLHCII-C (12 Chl)3.52.00.9<0.712LHCII-rec and LHCII-IEF3.01.81.00.212LHCII-C (13 Chl)3.82.11.0>0.713Pigment content per monomer (mon) of LHCII purified from control plants by sucrose gradient (LHCII-C) normalized at 12 and 13 Chls compared with the pigment composition of recombinant LHCII (LHCII-rec) and highly purified LHCII (LHCII-IEF) is shown.

Open table in a new tab Pigment content per monomer (mon) of LHCII purified from control plants by sucrose gradient (LHCII-C) normalized at 12 and 13 Chls compared with the pigment composition of recombinant LHCII (LHCII-rec) and highly purified LHCII (LHCII-IEF) is shown. Car, carotenoid; L, lutein; N, neoxanthin; V, violaxanthin. In conditions of excess light with respect to the capacity of the electron transport chain, xanthophyll cycle operates, thus de-epoxidizing violaxanthin to antheraxanthin and zeaxanthin. In order to verify if de-epoxidation affects xanthophyll distribution, we have analyzed thylakoids obtained from plants upon activation of xanthophyll cycle by treating plants for 2.5 h at 4 °C with strong light (1000 μE m−2s−1). Fig. 1 A (right) shows the separation obtained with de-epoxidized membranes ((Z + 1/2A)/VAZ = 40%, where Zrepresents zeaxanthin and A is antheraxanthin). The distribution of chlorophyll among sucrose gradient bands did not show significant differences with respect to the separation from control plants, and also the polypeptide composition was not affected (Fig.1 B). However, xanthophyll composition of bands 1–3 was significantly modified. In the following, we will indicate as “LHCII-S” the trimeric complex purified from stressed plants and as “LHCII-C” the one purified from control plants. The pigment composition of the fractions 1–6 from control “C” and stressed “S” plants are reported in Table I. The violaxanthin content of LHCII-S was (5.8% of total carotenoid), strongly decreased with respect to LHCII-C (18.5%). This loss is compensated by an increase of lutein (from 55.5 to 58.1%) and the appearance of small amounts of zeaxanthin (3.6%) and antheraxanthin (7%) (Table I). It is worth noting that the amount of VAZ in the two samples was different. While in the LHCII-C 9.2 mol of VAZ were found per 100 Chl a, in the case of LHCII-S, this value dropped to 8.1. The amount of zeaxanthin plus antheraxanthin bound to LHCII-S was as low as 0.4 mol per mol of polypeptide. The VAZ content in thylakoid membranes, normalized to the total chlorophyll content, from S and C plants, was essentially the same, indicating that, although a significant part of the violaxanthin bound to LHCII-C complexes has been converted to zeaxanthin under stress conditions, LHCII-S is not totally efficient in binding the zeaxanthin produced. The absorption spectra of LHCII trimers from stressed and control plants are shown in Fig. 2 after normalization at the Qy absorption peak. No differences were detected in the red region of the spectra. In the Soret region (400 and 520 nm), including the contribution of carotenoids, the two spectra are slightly different as shown by the LHCII-C/LHCII-S difference spectrum (see inset in Fig. 2). The absorption of control sample is higher in the 350–480-nm range, while LHCII-S shows increased absorption in the 480–550-nm red range consistently with the higher amount of red-shifted carotenoids lutein, antheraxanthin, and zeaxanthin (4Croce R. Weiss S. Bassi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29613-29623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) in the latter complex. LHCII-C trimers (fraction C3) were subjected to flatbed IEF followed by ultracentrifugation in sucrose gradient, and the collected green fractions containing LHCII were merged together in order to avoid introducing differences in the polypeptides composition with respect to the complex in C3. This treatment was shown to be effective in removing loosely bound pigments (7Ruban A.V. Lee P.J. Wentworth M. Young A.J. Horton P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10458-10465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 8Verhoeven A.S. Adams W.W. Demmig-Adams B. Croce R. Bassi R.

Biochem. 1993; 212: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). LHCII-C-IEF trimeric complex thus obtained had biochemical and spectroscopic properties identical to those previously reported (14Sandona D. Croce R. Pagano A. Crimi M. Bassi R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Thus, 12 Chl (seven Chl aand five Chl b) and three xanthophylls (1.8 lutein, 1.0 neoxanthin, and 0.2 violaxanthin) were bound per LHCII polypeptide (Table III). These values are also fully consistent with the composition of monomeric LHCII as studied by mutation analysis of recombinant LHCII (3Remelli R. Varotto C. Sandona D. Croce R. Bassi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33510-33521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 4Croce R. Weiss S. Bassi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29613-29623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Thus, the IEF treatment removed 0.5 molecules of violaxanthin, 0.3 of lutein, and one of Chla from the LHCII-C complex purified by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation. When the IEF procedure was applied to LHCII-S, a LHCII-S-IEF complex was obtained, which was indistinguishable from LHCII-C-IEF with respect to its pigment composition and absorption spectra. In this case, lutein (0.4 molecules) and zeaxanthin-antheraxanthin (0.4 molecules) were removed, showing that the pigment content of internal L1, L2, and N1 sites was not affected by the operation of the xanthophyll cycle (Table III). On the other hand, these results also show that, although the loose binding is preferential for violaxanthin, it can also bind lutein and, upon de-epoxidation, antheraxanthin and zeaxanthin. Neoxanthin content did not show any significant change, suggesting that this xanthophyll is not involved in the loose binding to LHCII.Table IIIPigment composition of LHCII complexes purified with different methodsSamplePigmentsChl a/bChl totNVAZLCar totChl/carLHCII-C1.53130.980.710.012.133.843.39LHCII-S1.53130.990.210.270.142.253.863.37LHCII-C-IEF1.42120.990.221.803.04.00LHCII-S-IEF1.41121.000.211.803.04.00The values are normalized to the number of Chls per monomer. tot, total; N, neoxanthin; V, violaxanthin; A, antheraxanthin; Z, zeaxanthin; L, lutein; Car, carotenoid; C, control; S, stressed; IEF, control after IEF.

The absorption spectra of the LHCII-C and LHCII-C-IEF are shown in Fig.3 after normalization to Chl content (34Giuffra E. Zucchelli G. Sandona D. Croce R. Cugini D. Garlaschi F.M. Bassi R. Jennings R.C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12984-12993Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The difference spectrum shows peaks at 431, 453, 485, and 665 nm. The 431- and 665-nm signals can readily be attributed to Chla. The 453- and 485-nm signals are tentatively attributed to removed xanthophylls, mainly violaxanthin, as suggested by the pigment analysis. This indicates a shift of the loosely bound violaxanthin by 12 nm as compared with 80% acetone (473 nm for the red-most S0-S20–0 transition). The difference spectrum is wider than the violaxanthin spectrum in the 490–510-nm region, accounting for the loss of lutein. It has been previously observed that the absorption spectrum of the violaxanthin in the two internal sites shows a shift of 19 nm as compared with the absorption in 80% acetone (4Croce R. Weiss S. Bassi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29613-29623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). This corresponds to an environment with refractive index of 1.55. The shift by 12 nm, observed for the loosely bound violaxanthin, indicates a refractive index of 1.5. Since violaxanthin red-most absorption, in α-DM micelles, peaks at 477 nm (corresponding to a refractive index of 1.43), loose binding to LHCII provides an environment with a refractive index intermediate between internal sites and detergent micelles, possibly indicating a peripheral location. In order to test the possibility that unspecific binding to LHCII could yield a similar shift, we used recombinant LHCII reconstituted in vitro with violaxanthin; when purified by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation, this complex still retains unspecifically bound violaxanthin, which is removed by a further purification step by FPLC (35Giuffra E. Cugini D. Croce R. Bassi R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 112-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The difference absorption spectra before and after FPLC showed that unspecifically bound violaxanthin absorbs at 477 nm. To gain additional information on the binding of peripheral violaxanthin, we proceeded to the determination of the orientation of the violaxanthin transition moment, lying along"

In mammalian cells, loss or disruption of a telomere can cause cellular senescence, cell death, or genomic instability, depending on the genotype and cell context. A variety of events can lead to dysfunctional telomeres. Telomeres can be damaged directly by genotoxic agents and/or faulty DNA repair processes. In addition, the telomeric structure can be disrupted by changes in the expression or function of certain telomere-associated proteins. Finally, telomeres can erode owing to the biochemistry of DNA replication, which leaves 50–200 bp1 of 3′-telomeric DNA unreplicated upon completion of each S phase. Thus, in the absence of the enzyme telomerase, or another mechanism to replenish telomeric DNA, proliferating cells progressively lose telomeric DNA and eventually acquire one or more critically short or dysfunctional telomeres (1Harley C.B. Futcher A.B. Greider C.W. Nature. 1990; 345: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (4632) Google Scholar, 2Blackburn E.H. Nature. 2000; 408: 53-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar, 3Lansdorp P. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2000; 118: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Most normal mammalian cells respond to a critically short or dysfunctional telomere by undergoing cellular senescence (4Campisi J. Eur. J. Cancer. 1997; 33: 703-709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 5Sedivy J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In Vivo. 2000; 14: 183-188PubMed Google Scholar). This process results in an irreversible arrest of cell proliferation and striking changes in cell function (8Campisi J. Dimri G.P. Hara E. Schneider E. Rowe J. Handbook of the Biology of Aging. 4th Ed. Academic Press, New York1996: 121-149Google Scholar). Dysfunctional telomeres can also induce apoptotic cell death, particularly in cells that harbor mutations in one or more cell cycle or DNA damage checkpoints (9Hahn W.C. Stewart S.A. Brooks M.W.

Science. 1999; 283: 1321-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). Very little is known about how telomeres signal cells to undergo senescence or apoptosis. However, the recent discovery of a telomere-associated poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) (12Smith S. Giriat I. Schmitt A. de Lange T. Science. 1998; 282: 1484-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar) provides a potential mechanism by which telomeres transmit signals to cellular proteins that regulate the senescence and apoptotic responses. PARPs catalyze the formation of branched chains of ADP-ribose polymers on selected proteins, using NAD+ as a substrate (13Shall S. de Murcia G. Mutat. Res. 2000; 460: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 14D'Amours D. Desnoyers S. D'Silva I. Poirier G.G. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 249-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Classic PARPs (PARPs 1–3) are activated in response to single- or double-strand DNA breaks, whereupon they ADP-ribosylate a number of proteins, including key regulators of transcription, cell cycle progression, and DNA repair. The ADP-ribosylation is transient and can either stimulate or inhibit the activity of the target proteins. PARP activation provides a rapid, post-translational signal that can halt the transcription and replication machineries and mobilize DNA repair machineries. PARPs are also important for suppressing recombination at DNA ends (15d'Adda di Fagagna F. Hande M.P. Tong W.M. Lansdorp P.M. Wan G.Z.Q. Jackson S.P. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 76-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 16Simbulan-Rosenthal C.M. Rosenthal D.S. Luo R. Li J.H. Zhang J. Smulson M.E.

Res. 2000; 154: 133-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), where certain DNA repair and recombination processes appear to occur (20Sakkers R.J. Brunsting J.F. Filon A.R. Kampinga H.H. Konings A.W. Mullenders L.H. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1999; 75: 875-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 21Bischof O. Kim S.H. Irving J. Beresten S. Ellis N.A. Campisi J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 367-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Because telomeres are DNA ends that are anchored to the nuclear matrix (19Pandita T.K. Dhar S. Radiat. Res. 2000; 154: 133-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Luderus M.E. van Steensel B. Chong L. Sibon O.C. Cremers F.F. de Lange T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 867-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), and appear to elicit a DNA damage response when dysfunctional, PARPs are also thought to participate in telomere maintenance and/or transmitting signals generated by dysfunctional telomeres. Consistent with this view, cells from knockout mice that lack PARP1, a classic PARP encoded by the ADPRT1 gene, have somewhat shorter (30%) telomeres than wild-type cells (15d'Adda di Fagagna F. Hande M.P. Tong W.M. Lansdorp P.M. Wan G.Z.Q. Jackson S.P. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 76-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Interestingly, cell lysates from the knockout mice have residual PARP activity (23Shieh W.M. Ame J.C. Wilson M.V. Wang Z.Q. Koh D.W. Jacobson M.K. Jacobson E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30069-30072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). This finding, and the mild telomere phenotype ofADPRT1 −/− mice, suggested that one or more PARP distinct from PARP1 may more directly participate in telomere maintenance and/or signaling. Thus far, the strongest candidate for such a PARP is tankyrase (12Smith S. Giriat I. Schmitt A. de Lange T. Science. 1998; 282: 1484-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar), referred to here as TANK1. TANK1 (encoded by the TNKS gene on human chromosome 8) (12Smith S. Giriat I. Schmitt A. de Lange T. Science. 1998; 282: 1484-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar,24Zhu L. Smith S. de Lange T. Seldin M.F. Genomics. 1999; 57: 320-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) is a non-classic PARP that interacts with and ADP-ribosylates the telomere-binding protein TRF1 (12Smith S. Giriat I. Schmitt A. de Lange T. Science. 1998; 282: 1484-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar). TANK1 lacks a nuclear localization signal and shows a predominantly perinuclear and cytoplasmic distribution, although it is found at the telomeres of metaphase chromosomes in cells that overexpress TRF1. In vitro, ribosylation by TANK1 displaces TRF1 from telomeric DNA (12Smith S. Giriat I. Schmitt A. de Lange T. Science. 1998; 282: 1484-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar). This finding, and the phenotype of cells that express a dominant negative TRF1 mutant (25van Steensel B. de Lange T. Nature. 1997; 385: 740-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar), suggested that TANK1 might be a positive regulator of telomere length in telomerase-expressing cells. Indeed, when overexpressed, a nuclear-targeted TANK1 protein increased telomere length in telomerase-positive tumor cells (26Smith S. de Lange T. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1299-1302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Here, we describe the characterization of a second tankyrase-like protein, TANK2, recently identified as a Golgi-associated protein (also referred to as TNKL) (27Chi N.W. Lodish H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38437-38444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 28Lyons R.J. Deane R. Lynch D.K. Ye Z.S. Sanderson G.M. Eyre H.J. Sutherland G.R. Daly R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17172-17180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). TANK2 is encoded by a distinct gene (TNKS2) on human chromosome 10. It shares >80% overall amino acid identity, and a similar intracellular distribution pattern, with TANK1. However, TANK2 contains a unique N-terminal domain, which is also conserved in the murineTNKS2 gene. In contrast to TANK1, however, TANK2, when overexpressed, induced rapid cell death with features of necrosis. Although there is as yet no direct evidence that TANK2 has PARP activity, we further show that TANK2-induced cell death is prevented by the general PARP inhibitor 3-aminobenzamide. Our results raise the possibility that TANK2 may be a more active PARP than TANK1 and/or have unique substrate specificities. Either attribute may enable it to signal cell death. WI-38 and HT1080 cells were obtained as described (29Dimri G.P. Lee X. Basile G. Acosta M. Scott G. Roskelley C. Medrano E.E. Linskens M. Rubelj I. Pereira-Smith O.M. Peacocke M. Campisi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9363-9367Crossref PubMed Scopus (5738) Google Scholar). 82-6 normal human fibroblasts were from Dr. J. Oshima (University of Washington), and VA13 cells were from the American Type Culture Collection. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 10% fetal calf serum, as described (29Dimri G.P. Lee X. Basile G. Acosta M. Scott G. Roskelley C. Medrano E.E. Linskens M. Rubelj I. Pereira-Smith O.M. Peacocke M. Campisi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9363-9367Crossref PubMed Scopus (5738) Google Scholar). A partial TNKS2cDNA was cloned from a human fibroblast yeast two-hybrid library using TRF1 as a bait. The library, vectors, and screening methods have been described (30Kim S.H. Kaminker P. Campisi J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Briefly, we transfected the library into yeast expressing the pGBT9-TRF1 bait vector and screened 106transformants on selective media containing 3-aminotriazole. Surviving colonies were tested for expression of the lacZ(β-galactosidase) reporter. One colony (pGAD-TANK2–1.7) that survived selection and expressed β-galactosidase contained a 1.7-kb insert, which we subcloned into pGEM-TA and sequenced. The insert was homologous to a central region of the TNKS cDNA. We named the gene encoding the insert TNKS2 and the corresponding protein TANK2. We mapped the TRF1 domain with which the protein fragment encoded by pGAD-TANK2–1.7 interacted using yeast two-hybrid analysis. Briefly, TERF1 cDNA fragments cloned into pGBT9 (30Kim S.H. Kaminker P. Campisi J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar) were introduced into yeast expressing pGAD-TANK2–1.7, and the level of β-galactosidase reporter activity was quantified as described (30Kim S.H. Kaminker P. Campisi J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). We generated a clone containing the TNKS2 open reading frame (ORF) by 5′ RNA ligase-mediated (RLM) rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) and 3′-RACE. To obtain the 3′ end, we used 3′-RACE to screen a human placenta Marathon cDNA library (CLONTECH), and we isolated a 2.7-kb fragment that we subcloned into pGEM-TA and sequenced. This fragment had 1 kb of sequence overlap with the pGAD-TANK2–1.7 insert, an additional 1.5 kb of coding sequence, a stop codon, and 200 bp of the 3′-untranslated region (UTR). To obtain the 5′ end, we used a 5′-RLM RACE kit (Ambion) to generate randomly primed cDNA libraries from human placenta (CLONTECH) and the human cell lines HT1080 and VA13. We obtained identical 450-bp products from all three libraries, as determined by sequencing. The combined cDNA fragments generated a continuous 3.4-kb ORF, with ∼200 bp each of 5′- and 3′-UTR (GenBankTM accession number AF342982). The fragments were assembled into a single cDNA using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction enzyme digestion and ligation. The assembled cDNA was cloned into pBluescript2SK+ (Stratagene) and then subcloned into vectors for epitope tagging or expression. The TANK2 ORF identified by RACE was identical to the ORF contained in three λ cDNA clones, isolated from a human 293 tumor cell λgt11 library by screening with a 347-bp probe corresponding to the TNKS2 ankyrin repeat region. The λ clones encompassed 6.1 kb of the TNKS2 cDNA. The partial (450 bp) mouse TNKS2 cDNA was isolated from mouse testis poly(A)+ RNA (Ambion) using 5′-RLM RACE and oligonucleotides corresponding to mouse ESTs with strong homology to human TNKS2. To determine the genomic organization of humanTNKS2, we screened a human bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library (Research Genetics) with a SacII cDNA fragment containing the initiation ATG and 5′-UTR of TNKS2. Four clones (534O13, 174E12, 126H3, and 530L19) were determined to contain the entire gene by PCR amplification of sequences at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the cDNA. We also identified a BAC sequence encompassingTNKS2 in the High Throughput Genomic Sequence data base (Chromosome 10; GenBankTM accession number AL359707), which had sequence gaps. We filled the gaps by sequencing the appropriate PCR fragments of the BAC clones. The pGAD-TANK2–1.7 insert was used to localize the TNKS2 gene by fluorescence in situ hybridization to 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)-banded metaphase chromosomes, as described (31Heng H.H. Tsui L.C. Chromosoma. 1993; 102: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). The TNKS2 location was confirmed and refined by radiation hybrid mapping, as described (32Walter M.A. Spillett D.J. Thomas P. Weissenbach J. Goodfellow P.N. Nat. Genet. 1994; 7: 22-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Briefly, we screened the medium resolution Stanford G3 panel using the primers GAT ACA CTC ACC GGA GAA AAG-3′ and GTG AAC TGG ACA CCC AGT ACC-3′, which amplified a 3-kb fragment from 13 out of 83 hybrid clones. These results were submitted to the Stanford RH server, which provided a map location and identified the closest marker. Poly(A) RNA (10 μg) was isolated (Qiagen) from HT1080 cells, separated, blotted onto a nylon membrane, and hybridized to TNKS- or TNKS2-specific probes, as described (33Dimri G.P. Hara E. Campisi J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16180-16186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Probes were generated by PCR using primers to amplify sequences encoding the unique TANK1 and TANK2 N termini. The primers used are CTC CCA ACC AGC CGG CAGT-3′ and CCA GCA GTT CCC GTA GGG CCC-3′ for TANK1, and ATG GGA CTG CGC CGG ATC CGG TGA CAG CAGG-3′ and GTG GAG CCG GCC GCC CGA GA-3′ for TANK2. A multiple tissue Northern blot containing 2 μg of poly(A) RNA from selected human tissues was purchased from CLONTECH, hybridized with a 1-kb probe corresponding to the TANK2 ankyrin domain, and rehybridized with a β-actin probe, as described (30Kim S.H. Kaminker P. Campisi J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). The TNKS2cDNA in pBluescript2SK± (0.2 μg of DNA), TNKScDNA in pBK-CMV (provided by T. deLange) (1 μg), and hTERT cDNA in pGRN125 (1 μg) were added to a coupled in vitro transcription/translation reaction containing [35S]methionine and rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega), as described (30Kim S.H. Kaminker P. Campisi J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Reactions were run for 60 min at 30 °C. The translation products were separated by 6.5% SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. cDNAs encoding TANK1, TANK2, or epitope-tagged TRF1 (HA-TRF1) were transcribed and translated in vitro as described above and co-immunoprecipitated as described (30Kim S.H. Kaminker P. Campisi J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Briefly, in vitro translated TANK1 or TANK2 was mixed with an equal amount of in vitro translated HA-TRF1 in 0.5 ml of binding buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1% Tween 20, Sigma mammalian protease inhibitors) and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Reactions were precleared with 25 μl of protein A/G beads (Pierce), and the supernatant was incubated with 5 μg of anti-HA antibody for 4 h at 4 °C. Protein A/G beads (25 μl) were added, and after 1 h incubation at 4 °C, the beads were collected by centrifugation and washed with binding buffer. Bound proteins were released by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and separated on 4–15% SDS-PAGE gels.35S signals were detected using a PhosphorImager. Western analysis was carried out as described previously (34Dimri G.P. Nakanishi M. Desprez P.Y. Smith J.R. Campisi J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2987-2997Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and autoradiography. Mouse monoclonal antibodies were used to detect V5 (R96025; Invitrogen), FLAG (M2 or M5; Sigma), and PARP (33–3100; Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Mouse monoclonal (575400; Calbiochem) or rabbit polyclonal (described below) antibodies detected both TANK1 and TANK2, as described in the text. We conjugated a peptide corresponding to amino acids 660–680 of TANK2 to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and we used the conjugate to produce polyclonal antiserum in rabbits using a commercial service (Covance). The peptide was also used to generate an affinity column (Sulfolink; Pierce). Rabbit serum was applied to the column, and washed with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 500 mm NaCl. Bound antibodies (Ab-591) were eluted with 100 mm glycine (pH 2.8), neutralized with 1 m Tris (pH 8), dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and stored at −80 °C. We immunostained cells as described previously (30Kim S.H. Kaminker P. Campisi J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 35Compton D.A. Yen T. Cleveland D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 1083-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells grown on coverslips were fixed in 10% formalin, blocked in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin, and stained with the mouse anti-V5 or anti-FLAG antibodies for 2 h at room temperature. Coverslips were washed and stained with fluorescein-conjugated goat-anti-mouse antibody and mounted in Vectashield containing DAPI (Vector Laboratories). Images were obtained using a cooled charged-couple device camera connected to an epifluorescence microscope. Cells on coverslips were transfected with the TNKS orTNKS2 cDNAs (in pBK-CMV or pcDNA3.1, respectively) or the CMV-β-galactosidase normalization vector, using FuGene 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), as instructed by the supplier. Transfection efficiency was estimated from CMV-galactosidase-transfected cultures by the fraction of β-galactosidase-positive cells, as described (33Dimri G.P. Hara E. Campisi J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16180-16186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell death was assessed by observing the number of adherent cells 6–10 h after transfection, and by staining with MitoCapture (Biovision), a fluorescent lipophilic cationic reagent that assesses mitochondrial membrane permeability, according to the supplier's instructions. Briefly, cells were incubated with the MitoCapture reagent for 15 min at 37 °C and counted by fluorescence microscopy using a wide band pass filter. Cells with intact mitochondria exhibited focal red cytosolic fluorescence, whereas cells with permeabilized mitochondria exhibited diffuse green cytosolic fluorescence. Cells lacking red fluorescence and having green fluorescence were scored positive. We identified TANK2 in a yeast two-hybrid screen (36Chien C.T. Bartel P.L. Sternglanz R. Fields S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9578-9582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar) of a human fibroblast cDNA library using TRF1 as a bait (30Kim S.H. Kaminker P. Campisi J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). The screen yielded several positive colonies, one of which harbored a vector (pGAD-TANK2–1.7) containing a 1.7-kb insert with striking sequence homology to TNKS, a gene encoding the TRF1-interacting protein named tankyrase or TANK1 (12Smith S. Giriat I. Schmitt A. de Lange T. Science. 1998; 282: 1484-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar, 27Chi N.W. Lodish H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38437-38444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The 1.7-kb insert spanned the region corresponding to the TANK1 ankyrin repeat domain. Sequencing showed that it shared 81% nucleotide identity toTNKS and 85% predicted amino acid identity to the TANK1 protein. This degree of homology, although highly significant, was sufficiently different to suggest that the 1.7-kb cDNA derived from a distinct, albeit related, gene. We refer to this gene asTNKS2 and the protein encoded by it as TANK2. This gene was recently independently identified (and named TNKL) as encoding a protein (TANK2) that, together with TANK1, associates with the Golgi apparatus (27Chi N.W. Lodish H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38437-38444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). To isolate the entire TNKS2 coding region, we used 5′-RLM-RACE and 3′-RACE. We assembled a 3.8-kb cDNA containing a 3.4-kb ORF with putative translational start and stop codons, and ∼200 bp each of the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions (UTRs). The ORF encoded an 1166-amino acid protein that had 85% identity to the ankyrin repeats, sterile α-motif, and PARP catalytic domain of TANK1 (Fig. 1 A). However, TANK2 contained a unique 25-amino acid N-terminal domain (NTD) that replaced the larger histidine-proline-serine (HPS)-rich domain in TANK1 (Fig.1 A). To verify the position of the initiation codon, we isolated a partial mouse TNKS2 (mTNKS2) cDNA encompassing the NTD and part of the 5′-UTR. The NTD was nearly identical between the human and mouse TANK2 proteins, with only 2 conservative amino acid changes in the first 56 residues (96% identity; Fig. 1 B). Both the murine and humanTNKS2 cDNAs have an ORF that extends downstream of the putative initiation ATG. They share 95% nucleotide identity throughout the 168 residues that encoded the first 56 amino acids, with 6 of the 8 mismatches occurring in the third position of codons. Upstream of the presumed initiation codon, the nucleotide identity declined abruptly (<83%), and the sequence mismatches were randomly distributed among all three codon positions (Fig. 1 B). This pattern of conservation strongly suggests that our human TNKS2 cDNA contained the translational start site. To confirm that TANK2 is not encoded by TNKS, we used fluorescencein situ hybridization to map TNKS2 to human chromosome 10q23-24 (not shown). This location was verified by radiation hybrid mapping, which localized TNKS2 more precisely to 10q23.3, and identified the closest marker as D10S536 (Fig. 2 A). This position agrees with a report that localized the gene (TNKL) identical to TNKS2 near D10S2170 (37Kuimov A.N. Kuprash D.V. Petrov V.N. Vdovichenko K.K. Scanlan M.J. Jongeneel C.V. Lagarkova M.A. Nedospasov S.A. Genes Immun. 2001; 2: 52-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Since TNKS is located on chromosome 8 (24Zhu L. Smith S. de Lange T. Seldin M.F. Genomics. 1999; 57: 320-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), these findings verify that TNKS2 is distinct from TNKS. To determine the genomic organization of TNKS2, we analyzed the High Throughput Genomic Sequence data base and identifiedTNKS2 sequences encompassing most of the gene, albeit with some sequence gaps. To close the gaps, we screened a human BAC library, obtained four BACs containing the TNKS2 gene, and sequenced the relevant segments. The TNKS2 gene is ∼66 kb in size, organized into 26 introns and 27 exons, all of which contain coding sequences and two of which also contain 5′- and 3′-UTR sequences (Fig.2 B). The exons range from 37 to 484 bp, whereas the introns vary greatly in size, from 89 bp to 14 kb. To determine the expression pattern of TNKS2 among human tissues, we probed a Northern blot containing poly(A) RNA from human heart, brain, placenta, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, and pancreas with a cDNA probe corresponding to a 1-kb region encompassing the ankyrin domain of TANK2. The probe detected a single 6.6-kb mRNA species (Fig.3 A). TNKS2 mRNA was expressed in all the tissues tested (including liver, evident on longer exposures), albeit to varying levels. In addition, a different multitissue Northern blot showed that the mRNA was expressed in spleen, thymus, prostate, testis, ovary, small intestine, colon, and peripheral blood leukocytes (not shown). Thus, the TNKS2appeared to be ubiquitously expressed among human tissues. Because the TANK2 probe used in this analysis shared significant sequence similarity to TANK1, we designed cDNA probes corresponding to the unique N-terminal domains of TANK1 and TANK2. We hybridized these probes to Northern blots of polyadenylated RNA from cultured HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells. As expected (12Smith S. Giriat I. Schmitt A. de Lange T. Science. 1998; 282: 1484-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar), the TANK1-specific probe hybridized to multiple mRNA species, ranging in size from 2 to 9 kb (Fig. 3 B). By contrast, the TANK2-specific probe hybridized to a single 6.6-kb mRNA species (Fig. 5 B). This size is consistent with the analysis of human tissue RNA (Fig. 3 A) and with the size of the TNKS2 cDNA contained in the λ clones. These results verify that TANK1 and TANK2 are produced from different mRNAs and indicate that TNKS2, in contrast toTNKS, generates only a single major mRNA species. To verify that the predicted ORF in the TNKS2 cDNA is correct and to characterize the TANK2 protein, we transcribed and translated the TNKS andTNKS2 cDNAs in vitro, and we analyzed the radiolabeled translation products by SDS-PAGE (Fig.4 A). Both cDNAs produced a single labeled protein. As expected (12Smith S. Giriat I. Schmitt A. de Lange T.

HS biosynthetic modifications may determine the strength and outcome of HS-ligand interactions. We previously described the phenotype of mice with a gene-trap mutation inHs2st, encoding the key HS 2-O-sulfotransferase enzyme in HS polymer modification. In contrast to the early developmental failure of embryos lacking HS, the onset of abnormalities in the Hs2st−/− mice occurs only after midgestation, the most dramatic being the complete failure of kidney development. Uronate 2-O-sulfates were not detected in the mutant HS, indicating a complete loss of function of Hs2st. However, the domain structure of the mutant HS is conserved, and compensatory increases in N- and 6-O-sulfation maintain the overall charge density. The apparent affinities of the mutant HS for hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor and fibronectin were unchanged but were reduced for fibroblast growth factor-1 and -2. Surprisingly, theHs2st−/− cells were able to mount an apparently normal signaling response to fibroblast growth factor-1 and -2 as well as to hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor.

It is becoming increasingly apparent that many of these factors have a requirement for, or have their activity modulated by, heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs).1 HSPGs can guide their diffusion, create localized concentrations, or act as necessary co-receptors (reviewed in Refs. 1Lyon M.

Development. 1997; 124: 4113-4120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) signaling pathways. HSPGs are common pericellular constituents composed of one or more linear heparan sulfate (HS) polysaccharide chains covalently attached to a protein core. One of the most notable features of HS is its high degree of structural heterogeneity. This is partly a direct result of its nontemplate-driven biosynthesis (reviewed in Ref. 8Lindahl U. Kusche-Gullberg M. Kjellén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24979-24982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar) but also a consequence of cell type-specific structural polymorphisms (9Sanderson R.D. Turnbull J.E. Gallagher J.T. Lander A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13100-13106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This characteristic of HS, in contrast to the relative homogeneity of the related but physiologically restricted heparin, is central to the function of HSPGs in the modulation of specific signaling pathways (1Lyon M. Gallagher J.T. Matrix Biol. 1998; 17: 485-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The diversity of HS chain structure is generated by sequential modifications to the heparan precursor formed from alternatingN-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAcα1) and glucuronic acid units (4GlcA). These modifications produce clusters of sulfated residues (S domains) at intervals along the HS chain (10Gallagher J.T. Turnbull J.E. Lyon M. Int. J. Biochem. 1992; 24: 553-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Transformation is initiated by the N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase (NDST) enzymes, which usually modify 40–50% of GlcNAc toN-sulfoglucosamine (GlcNS). Subsequently, a glucuronyl epimerase can convert adjacent GlcA to iduronate (IdoA).O-Sulfotransferases then further modify these GlcNS/IdoA-rich domains, beginning with HS-2OST, which transfers sulfate to C-2 of IdoA. Finally, 6-O- and 3-O-sulfotransferases (HS-6OST and -3OSTs) complete the heparan-to-HS transition by transferring sulfates to C-6 or C-3 of the amino sugars. The NDSTs, HS-6OSTs, and HS-3OSTs are all members of multigene families and display subtly different substrate specificities within family members (11Aikawa J.-i. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2690-2695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 12Habuchi H. Tanaka M. Habuchi O. Yoshida K. Suzuki H. Ban K. Kimata K. J. Biol.

Although recent advances in the cloning and recombinant expression of these various enzymes are beginning to highlight specific sequence requirements for certain isoforms, the interdependencies of the biosynthetic componentsin vivo remain poorly understood. The HS sequence patterns generated by these enzymes have profound consequences on their activity toward a wide range of ligands. For example, FGF-1, FGF-2 (16Rapraeger A.C. Krufka A. Olwin B.B.

Chem. 1994; 269: 11216-11223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) each require different HS modifications for optimal binding. The necessity for the correct complement of enzymes to generate these patterns at various stages of development is becoming apparent from studies of biosynthetic enzyme mutants in Drosophila, Caenorhabditis elegans, mice, and humans. Mice with a null mutation in one of the HS co-polymerases (EXT-1) fail to complete gastrulation and die in utero (20Lin X. Wei G. Shi Z. Dryer L. Esko J.D. Wells D.E. Matzuk M.M. Dev. Biol. 2000; 224: 299-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the mutation of HS modification enzymes causes more tissue-restricted phenotypes. The inactivation of NDST-1 leads to neonatal death caused by abnormalities in the lungs and other organs (21Ringvall M. Ledin J. Holmborn K. van Kuppevelt T. Ellin F. Eriksson I. Olofsson A.M. Kjellén L. Forsberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25926-25930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), whereas with NDST-2 there was a failure of mast cell differentiation associated with an absence of heparin synthesis (22Forsberg E. Pejler G. Ringvall M. Lunderius C. Tomasini-Johansson B. Kusche-Gullberg M. Eriksson I. Ledin J. Hellman L. Kjellén L. Nature. 1999; 400: 773-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Mice homozygous for a gene-trap insertion in the Hs2st gene suffer from bilateral renal agenesis and abnormalities of the skeleton and eye and die at birth (23Bullock S.L. Fletcher J.M. Beddington R.S.P. Wilson V.A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1894-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Animals defective in discrete steps of HS biosynthesis therefore provide valuable opportunities for studying the interrelationships between the biosynthetic components and the consequences of altered sulfation on growth factor binding in vivo. We have examined some of the structural and functional properties of HS produced by fibroblasts from Hs2st−/− embryos. Results indicate that the disrupted gene is inactive but also that in its absence the biosynthetic machinery produces a novel HS structure that, surprisingly, retains several of the binding and activation properties originally believed to require 2-O-sulfation (2S). These findings have important implications for our understanding of the mode of action of HS in regulating cellular responses to growth factors in development. Glasgow modified Eagle's medium, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and fetal calf serum were from Life Technologies, Inc. Heparinase I–III (Flavobacterium heparinum) were all from Grampian Enzymes (Orkney, UK). Chondroitinase ABC (Proteus vulgaris), bovine plasma fibronectin, and monoclonal antibodies against diphosphorylated ERK1/2 were from Sigma. The gels used were Sepharose CL-6B and DEAE-Sephacel (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and Bio-Gels P-10 (fine grade) and P-2 (Bio-Rad). The ProPac PA-1 HPLC column was from Dionex (Camberley, UK). d-[6-3H]glucosamine hydrochloride (20–45 Ci mmol−1) and Na235SO4 (1050–1600 Ci mmol−1) were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Recombinant human FGF-1, FGF-2, and HGF/SF were all from R&D Systems (Abingdon, UK). Derivation and genotyping of mice heterozygous for the gene-trap insertion in the Hs2st gene (Hs2stTgNSt125NIMR) were as described previously (23Bullock S.L. Fletcher J.M. Beddington R.S.P. Wilson V.A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1894-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Embryos (E12.5) obtained from mating heterozygousHs2st+/− animals were dissected. The heads were removed and stained with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside for 30 min (24Beddington R.S. Morgernstern J. Land H. Hogan A. Development. 1989; 106: 37-46PubMed Google Scholar) to determine the copy number of the lacZreporter gene. This has been confirmed previously as a reliable genetic indicator using polymerase chain reaction genotyping (23Bullock S.L. Fletcher J.M. Beddington R.S.P. Wilson V.A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1894-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). After the removal of the liver, pooled embryos were cut into small pieces, washed repeatedly in PBS, and then seeded in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, penicillin (100 units ml−1), and streptomycin (100 μg ml−1). The cells were maintained in culture for 1–2 weeks. Antibiotics were removed for 1 week before radiolabeling. At passage 2 or 3, cells at ∼80% confluency were labeled for 72 h with 50 μCi ml−1Na235SO4 and 30 μCi ml−1 [3H]glucosamine. The medium and cell layers were digested with Pronase as described previously (19Lyon M. Deakin J.A. Mizuno K. Nakamura T. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11216-11223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting peptidoglycans were loaded onto a 5-ml DEAE-Sephacel column and washed with 100 ml of PBS. Bound material was eluted with a gradient of 0.15–0.825 m NaCl in 20 mmphosphate, pH 7.0. Fractions of 1 ml were collected, and aliquots were taken for scintillation counting. Chondroitin/dermatan sulfates were not clearly resolved from HS, but hyaluronate was removed. Pooled sulfated glycosaminoglycans were desalted on a PD-10 column eluted in H2O and then lyophilized. Each glycosaminoglycan pool was digested with chondroitinase ABC, and the products were separated by gel filtration on a Sepharose CL-6B column (66 × 1.5 cm), eluted with 0.2 mNH4HCO3 at 12 ml h−1. Fractions corresponding to intact HS chains were pooled and lyophilized three times. An aliquot (50,000 cpm of 3H) was treated with 1m NaBH4/50 mm NaOH at 45 °C for 24 h to generate free HS chains. These were then reapplied to the above Sepharose CL-6B column to estimate their molecular size distribution (performed in triplicate). Two aliquots (10,000 cpm of3H) of HS chains were taken for fragmentation analysis. One was treated with low pH nitrous acid (25Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3943-3950Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and the other with 20 milli-international units/ml of heparinase III in 0.1 msodium acetate/0.1 mm calcium acetate, pH 7.0, for 4 h at 37 °C. Oligosaccharide products were separated on a Bio-Gel P-10 gel filtration column (170 × 1 cm) eluted with 0.1 mNH4HCO3 at 4 ml h−1 with collection of 1-ml fractions. HS chains (50,000 cpm of3H) were digested with a combination of heparinases I, II, and III (19Lyon M. Deakin J.A. Mizuno K. Nakamura T. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11216-11223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Disaccharides (>95% of total HS counts) were recovered from a Bio-Gel P-2 column (150 × 1 cm) eluted at 4 ml h−1 in 0.1 m NH4HCO3with collection of 1-ml fractions. Disaccharides were analyzed by strong anion-exchange HPLC on a ProPac PA-1 column eluted with a linear gradient of 0–1 m NaCl in MilliQ water, pH 3.5, at a flow rate of 1 ml min−1 (19Lyon M. Deakin J.A. Mizuno K. Nakamura T. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11216-11223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fractions of 0.5 ml were counted, and disaccharides were identified by comparison with known standards. Interactions of HS with various protein ligands were studied using a filter binding assay (26Maccarana M. Casu B. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23898-23905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, FGF-1 and FGF-2 (both 100 ng), HGF/SF (250 ng), or fibronectin (100 μg) were incubated at room temperature for 2 h with 10,000 cpm of 3H-labeled medium HS from both wild-type (WT) and mutant cells. The incubation solution used was 20 μl of either 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in H2O, pH 7.4 (for fibronectin), or 0.13 m NaCl, 1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4 (for all others). Samples were drawn through buffer-equilibrated cellulose nitrate disc filters held on a 12-well vacuum manifold. The filters were washed with 2 × 1 ml of 0.01 m NaCl/20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 (for fibronectin) or 0.13 mNaCl/20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 (for all others), to collect the unbound fraction. Bound material was step-eluted with increasing NaCl concentrations (1 ml each) and separated by a 1-ml wash with the incubation solutions (without bovine serum albumin). For each experiment, the [3H]HS present in each salt elution was combined with the subsequent wash to generate the eluted quantity. Any [3H]HS remaining bound to the filter at the end was measured by direct scintillation counting of the filter. WT or mutant embryonic fibroblasts were seeded at equal densities (∼60–70% confluent) in 24-well plates. After 24 h of growth in Glasgow modified Eagle's medium/10% fetal calf serum, they were washed with PBS and grown for a further 2 h in serum-free Glasgow modified Eagle's medium. HGF/SF, FGF-1, or FGF-2 were then added to the wells at three different concentrations (0.1, 1, and 10 ng/ml) in duplicate. After 10 min at 37 °C, the medium was discarded, and the cells were scraped into 100 μl of boiling nonreducing SDS sample buffer. Duplicate wells were pooled. Equal amounts of cell lysate (25 μl) were subjected to electrophoresis in 15% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels in the presence of SDS. Western blots were probed using a monoclonal antibody against activated ERK1/2 followed by a peroxidase-conjugated anti-IgG secondary antibody and ECL detection. For an HS-depleted control, the cells were washed with PBS and then grown in serum-free Glasgow modified Eagle's medium for 1 h only. A combination of heparinases I, II, and III (16 milli-international units each) was then added to each well for a further hour. After this time, (i) growth factor was added at 1 ng/ml, (ii) serum-free medium was exchanged for medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, or (iii) serum-free medium was retained for a further 10 min at 37 °C. Metabolically 3H/35S-radiolabeled HS peptidoglycans were prepared from WT and mutant primary embryonic fibroblasts. No differences were observed in elution characteristics of the WT and mutant HS samples by ion exchange (data not shown), suggesting little difference in overall charge density. The proportions of chondroitin/dermatan sulfates to HS were also the same for both WT and Hs2st−/− cells (data not shown). No significant size differences were seen between the WT and mutant HS chains on Sepharose CL-6B, although in both cases the cellular HS was consistently longer than the medium-derived HS (K av values of 0.45 and 0.5, respectively, corresponding to ∼30 and 20 kDa by reference to the calibration of Wasteson (27Wasteson A. J. Chromatogr. 1971; 59: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar)) (Fig. 1). The most dramatic difference between the WT and mutant HS was the lack of detectable 2S in the mutant HS (Fig. 2 and Table I). There was, however, a 13% increase in 6S and a 9% increase in NS. Interestingly, the increase in 6S was confined to GlcNS residues that are predominantly located in S domains (see below). There was a small reduction in the 6S of GlcNAc residues in the mutant HS compared with the WT (8 versus 10%). These analyses therefore indicate that the gene-trap insertion completely ablates HS-2OST enzyme activity. Furthermore, they demonstrate changes in both the level of NS and the extent and positioning of 6S within the mutant HS.Table ISulphate distribution within HS from WT and Hs2st−/− cells (calculated from disaccharide analyses shown in Fig. 2)Sulphate composition (% of total disaccharide units)N-sulphated2-O-sulphated6-O-sulphatedWT HSCE441718M391617Hs2st−/−HSCE49030M51030Chinese hamster ovary CellsWT453025pgsF-1765<134Included for comparison are the published data from the analysis of Chinese hamster ovary WT and mutant (pgsF-17) HS (28Bai X.

The oligosaccharide profiles obtained by treatment of WT HS are characteristic of “normal” HS, with similar amounts of tetra- and disaccharides (Fig.3). The close association betweenN- and O-sulfation is apparent, with the majority of the 35S label present within the di- and tetrasaccharides (the disaccharide peak also contains the free35SO4 liberated from the N-sulfate groups). The profile obtained from the mutant HS showed a relatively similar domain structure, considering the dramatic alteration in disaccharide composition (Fig. 2 and Table I). The close link between NS and O-sulfation (effectively 6S alone) was again retained. Overall (Table II), there is a 15–20% increase in NS in the mutant HS (in very good agreement with the disaccharide composition; see Table I) together with an apparent consolidation of these N-sulfates into more contiguous (i.e. longer) S domains with noticeably fewer alternating sequences.Table IIProportion and distribution of linkages susceptible to low pH nitrous acid scission in HS from both WT and Hs2st−/− mice (calculated from Fig. 3)Proportion of total linkages susceptibleArrangement of disaccharide units with susceptible linkagesContiguousAlternatingSpaced%%WT HSCE43393823M41373825Hs2st−/−HSCE49542620M50562717M, medium; CE, cell extract.

Heparinase III has a broad specificity, being able to cleave glycosidic bonds of the type GlcNR(±6S)-IdoA/GlcA (where GlcNR represents either GlcNS or GlcNAc). Its action is blocked by the 2S of IdoA. We found a dramatic difference between the pattern of digested oligosaccharides from the mutantversus WT HS (Fig. 4). The WT HS clearly contained a characteristic size range (tetra- to tetradecasaccharides) of resistant S domains. These were virtually absent from the mutant HS. To assess how the dramatic alterations in the structure of the Hs2st−/−HS has affected its binding to three growth factors known to require HS for their mitogenic activity (FGF-1, FGF-2, and HGF/SF) together with the extracellular matrix protein, fibronectin, we used a nitrocellulose filter binding assay. The amount of HS bound, as a proportion of the total applied, was similar for both HS types with each of the protein ligands. Interestingly, significant changes were seen in the apparent affinity of mutant HS for some protein ligands but not for others. There was no difference in affinity between the WT and mutant HS for both HGF/SF (Fig. 5 C) and fibronectin (Fig. 5 D). In contrast, the apparent affinity of the mutant HS was reduced for both FGF-1 and FGF-2. WT HS was able to bind FGF-2 up to 1–2 m NaCl, whereas the mutant HS bound more weakly, eluting predominantly over 0.4–0.8 m NaCl (Fig. 5 B). With FGF-1, both mutant and WT HS eluted over a wide range of salt concentrations. However, whereas most of the mutant HS dissociated between 0.2–0.5 m NaCl, ∼50% of the WT HS eluted with 0.5–1.0 m NaCl (Fig. 5 A). To assess how these observed differences in apparent affinity of the mutant and WT HS for the various growth factors affected the ability of cells from theHs2st−/− mice to respond to these ligands, we used an assay for the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK). The responses from both the WT and mutant cells to each of the three growth factors (FGF-1, FGF-2, and HGF/SF) were surprisingly similar (Fig. 6). For both genotypes, the activation of ERK occurred with as little as 0.1 ng/ml of each growth factor. Stimulation clearly depended on the HS chains, because the response to FGF-2 (for example) was lost if the cells were pretreated with a combination of heparinases to specifically degrade all cellular HS (Fig. 6 B). A response could be recovered by adding 10% serum, which presumably contains cell surface HS-independent stimulatory factors. To demonstrate that the response of the mutant cells was not caused by an increased receptor number (compared with WT), primers were designed that recognized the conserved regions of FGF receptors 1 and 2. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was then used to amplify the message for these proteins in both WT and mutant cells; no difference in the expression level was observed (data not shown). This study is the first description of the overall sulfation pattern and domain structure of HS from an animal lacking a key HS modification enzyme, namely HS-2OST. Its implications are important for understanding the relationships between HS biosynthesis and its structure and function, particularly in developmental processes. Targeted mutagenesis of the gene encoding a HS polymerase has shown that embryos completely deficient in HS fail to complete gastrulation (20Lin X. Wei G. Shi Z. Dryer L. Esko J.D. Wells D.E. Matzuk M.M. Dev. Biol. 2000; 224: 299-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar), demonstrating that the complex signaling events required to set up the body plan require HS. Hs2st expression is widespread from early embryogenesis, as expected for an essential component of normal HS biosynthesis (23Bullock S.L. Fletcher J.M. Beddington R.S.P. Wilson V.A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1894-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Despite this, the onset of abnormalities in the Hs2st−/− gene-trap mice occurs only after midgestation. In addition, a number of tissues that normally express the enzyme seem unaffected by the mutation. The absence of 2S in the mutant HS strongly argues against this mutant phenotype resulting from residual activity of N-terminal HS-2OST sequences retained in the gene-trap fusion protein or compensation by other possible isoforms. The late onset of theHs2st−/− phenotype is thus likely to reflect the ability of the atypical mutant HS to mediate some of the key HS-dependent steps in embryogenesis. Unlike the known isoformic complexities of the NDST, HS-6OST, and HS-3OST enzyme families (11Aikawa J.-i. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2690-2695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 12Habuchi H. Tanaka M. Habuchi O. Yoshida K. Suzuki H. Ban K. Kimata K. J. Biol.

The extent and pattern of 2S within an HS chain may therefore be determined by other factors such as the position or relative amount of the HS-2OST within the biosynthetic enzyme complex. In this respect, it is intriguing that during later development, the levels of Hs2st expression vary dynamically in different embryonic tissues (23Bullock S.L. Fletcher J.M. Beddington R.S.P. Wilson V.A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1894-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Also, Hs2st expression is virtually absent from the developing heart (23Bullock S.L. Fletcher J.M. Beddington R.S.P. Wilson V.A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1894-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) and the late kidney, 2V. A. Wilson and D. C. Swan, unpublished data. suggesting that at least in some tissues a functional HS may exist which is poorly 2-O-sulfated. Prior to the generation of mice carrying targeted mutations, Bai and Esko (28Bai X. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17711-17717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) generated chemically mutated Chinese hamster ovary cell lines deficient in elements of the HS biosynthetic pathway. One such cell line, pgsF-17, lacked (<1%) 2S of its HS (Table I). Interestingly, this HS, in common with that from the Hs2st−/−mouse, was found to have an overall increase in sulfation. However, the major increase in sulfation in the former was in NS, with only a minor increase in 6S (Table I), whereas the HS fromHs2st−/− cells was enriched mainly in GlcNS(6S). One possible explanation for this difference is that the NDST/HS-6OST isoforms expressed by Chinese hamster ovary cells may be cell type-specific and confer altered specificities for the pattern of modifications they impose on HS. Alternatively, the NDST/HS-6OST subset present may respond differently to the absence of HS-2OST activity. Overall, the extended S domains in the pgsF-17 mutant HS may therefore have a lower charge density than the Chinese hamster ovary WT HS. However, in the Hs2st−/− HS, the charge density of the moderately lengthened S domains is maintained (if not exceeded) by the dramatic increase in 6S, offsetting the absence of 2S (Fig. 7). In both cases, these changes indicate that N- and O-sulfation must be linked and may not be strictly sequential. The availability of HS totally deficient in 2S allows a definitive investigation of its role in the binding and activation of protein ligands. Previously, such analyses have relied heavily upon the use of chemically 2-O-desulfated heparin, in which total 2S removal was not necessarily achieved (26Maccarana M. Casu B. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23898-23905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A distinct advantage of theHs2st−/− HS is that the effect of the specific and total loss of 2S can be assessed in the context of a relatively normal HS chain macro structure. This may help explain our observation that 2S was not necessary for the potentiation of signaling by either FGF-1 or FGF-2, a surprising result given the strong requirement for 2S reported previously (18Guimond S.

Biochem. 1997; 121: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In the case of FGF-2, contiguous IdoA(2S) residues are essential for high affinity binding (30Turnbull J.E. Fernig D.G. Ke Y. Wilkinson M.C. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10337-10341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a minimal recognition sequence contains one IdoA(2S) (26Maccarana M. Casu B. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23898-23905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). X-ray crystallography has also shown that a single IdoA(2S) can make contacts with at least two individual amino acid side chains within FGF-2 (32Faham S. Hileman R.E. Fromm J.R. Linhardt R.J. Rees D.C. Science. 1996; 271: 1116-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). However, the induction of FGF-2 activity also requires at least one GlcNS(6S) residue (possibly involved in binding to the FGF receptor) in more extended sequences (18Guimond S. Maccarana M. Olwin B.B. Lindahl U. Rapraeger A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23906-23914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Pye D.A. Vivés R.R. Turnbull J.E. Hyde P. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22936-22942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). In the case of FGF-1, at least one GlcNS(6S) residue is necessary for high affinity binding (29Kreuger J. Prydz K. Pettersson R.F. Lindahl U. Salmivirta M. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 723-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The pgsF-17 cells were unable to bind FGF-2 in >0.6 m NaCl (28Bai X. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17711-17717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), whereas the Hs2st−/− HS binds up to 1m NaCl. Thus there is a characteristic unique to theHs2st−/− HS that allows it to retain an affinity more similar to that of WT HS and is also sufficient to allow apparently normal downstream signaling. The most likely explanation is that the domain structure/charge distribution of HS, which is mostly preserved in the Hs2st−/− HS, is of considerable importance. Possibly, both FGF-1 and FGF-2 require not only a specific pattern of 6S but also a normal S-domain pattern for activity. Interestingly, other studies have also suggested that potentiation of FGF-1 and FGF-2 signaling by HS does not always require high affinity binding (34Wang H. Toida T. Shik Kim Y. Capila I. Hileman R.E. Bernfield M. Linhardt R.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 35Rahmoune H. Chen H.L. Gallagher J.T. Rudland P.S. Fernig D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7303-7310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). There previously had been some uncertainty over the need for 2S for HGF/SF binding to HS (11Aikawa J.-i. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2690-2695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 19Lyon M. Deakin J.A. Mizuno K. Nakamura T. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11216-11223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We previously observed no positive correlation between 2S content and increasing affinity for HGF/SF among S domains (19Lyon M. Deakin J.A. Mizuno K. Nakamura T. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11216-11223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas Ashikari et al. (36Ashikari S. Habuchi H. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29586-29593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) suggested a definite requirement for clusters of 2S. However, there was no requirement for 2S in the high affinity interaction between HGF/SF and dermatan sulfate (37Lyon M. Deakin J.A. Rahmoune H. Fernig D.G. Nakamura T. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 271-278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The comparable binding to HGF/SF of the WT and Hs2st−/− HS species demonstrates unequivocally that 2S is also not needed for interaction with HS. The interaction between HS and fibronectin is less well defined. The major HS-binding site (Hep-2) appears to be quite extended, possibly involving up to 11 basic amino acid residues (38Sharma A. Askari J.A. Humphries M.J. Jones E.Y. Stuart D.I. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1468-1479Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and may accommodate up to a HS tetradecasaccharide. Interaction of Hep-2 with HS seems to strengthen with increasing overall sulfate density (including 2S) (39Lyon M. Rushton G. Askari J.A. Humphries M.J. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4599-4606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The identical fibronectin-binding behavior of the WT andHs2st−/− HS species suggests that 2S does not in fact constitute essential residues. Their loss is presumably adequately offset by further contacts facilitated by the associated increases in 6S and NS. Retention of an approximately normal domain pattern in theHs2st−/− HS may also influence interactions with HS catabolic enzymes. Intracellular heparanases degrade HS chains to shorter fragments, a key event in HSPG turnover. Bai et al. (40Bai X. Bame K.J. Habuchi H. Kimata K. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23172-23179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) showed that a loss of 2S in the HS from pgsF-17 cells prevented its cleavage by endogenous heparanases but not the overall catabolism of the chains. There is no evidence from our unchanged size distributions (Fig. 1) that this is the case in theHs2st−/− HS. In this study we have been able to show the effects, within an otherwise normal biosynthetic system, of the complete loss of an essential element of normal HS modification upon the structure, ligand-binding, and growth factor-modulating properties of the resultant HS. We have shown that the gene-trap technique used to generate the mutant mice results in complete inactivation of HS-2OST activity. The lack of any other detectable alteration in theHs2st−/− genotype (23Bullock S.L. Fletcher J.M. Beddington R.S.P. Wilson V.A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1894-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) makes it reasonable to attribute all the defects observed to alterations in HS structure. The demonstration that cells from the mutant mice retain their ability to respond apparently normally to a range of growth factors is reinforcedin vivo by the apparently normal development of a wide variety of tissues until late in gestation. The dramatic alteration in apparent affinity of the Hs2st−/− HS for certain ligands may also indicate that the correct modulatory functions of HS within these mice are compromised in the intact embryo. This may explain why a wide range of tissues are affected in a mild but entirely reproducible manner (23Bullock S.L. Fletcher J.M. Beddington R.S.P. Wilson V.A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1894-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar).2 The phenotype of theHs2st−/− mouse is therefore likely to reflect the way in which a structurally unusual HS is able to fulfil some but not all of the complex range of functions required of normal HS during development.

Double strand breaks can result from several events: ionizing radiation, DNA-damaging agents, replication errors, and specific enzymes that act in meiosis, mating-type switching, and V(D)J recombination (1Lett J.T.

HR is an important process for the preservation of the DNA sequence in chromosomal DNA. The homologous pairing step of the HR pathway, which is the process of searching for sequence homology in either homologous chromosomes or sister chromatids, is an essential step. Therefore, the identification of the enzymes that promote homologous pairing has been one of the central drives toward an understanding of the HR pathway (6West S.C. Annu. Rev.

In Escherichia coli, two homologous pairing enzymes, the RecA and RecT proteins, have been reported (8McEntee K. Weinstock G.M. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In addition, ScRad52 and HsRad52 both reportedly enhance the joint molecule formation between circular ssDNA and linear double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) that is promoted by the ScRad51 (S . c erevisiae Rad51) and HsRad51 (H .s apiens Rad51) proteins (32Benson F.E.

Therefore, Rad52 has been proposed to be a mediator protein that binds ssDNA and facilitates the loading of Rad51 onto the recombination site (36Van Dyck E. Stasiak A.Z. Stasiak A. West S.C. Nature. 1999; 398: 728-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 40McIlwraith M.J. Van Dyck E. Masson J.Y. Stasiak J.Y. Stasiak A. West S.C. J. Mol.

In addition to its role in the Rad51-dependent recombination pathway, the role of Rad52 in the Rad51-independent recombination pathways has also been studiedin vivo (42Aguilera A. Curr. Genet. 1995; 27: 298-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 43Ivanov E.L. Sugawara N. Fishman-Lobell J. Haber J.E. Genetics. 1996; 142: 693-704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44Haber J.E.

However, its precise molecular mechanism is not well understood. Interestingly, HsRad52 itself promotes homologous pairing between ssDNA fragments and superhelical dsDNA substrates (46Kurumizaka H. Aihara H. Kagawa W. Shibata T. Yokoyama S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 537-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This activity, along with the single-stranded annealing, may provide the framework for the role of Rad52 in such a pathway. In the present study, the homologous pairing activity of HsRad52 has been biochemically characterized. HsRad52 showed maximal homologous pairing activity at a concentration that just saturated the ssDNA. The HsRad52-ssDNA complex formation is a critical step in the homologous pairing reaction, because an incubation of HsRad52 with dsDNA before the addition of ssDNA inhibited the reaction. The conserved N-terminal domain of HsRad52, which was revealed by a limited proteolysis, formed a nucleoprotein filament with ssDNA and catalyzed homologous pairing with an efficiency similar to that of the wild type HsRad52 protein. HsRad52 and HsRad521–237were both purified in a three-step procedure involving Ni-NTA-agarose purification, the removal of the hexahistidine tag, and heparin-Sepharose purification, to facilitate comparison of the activities. MonoS column chromatography was used to concentrate the HsRad52 protein. Both proteins were cloned into the T7 polymerase expression vector pET-15b (Novagen). The proteins were overexpressed in the E. coli strain JM109 (DE3) along with E. colitRNAArg3 and tRNAArg4, which recognize the CGG and AGA/AGG codons, respectively. Expression levels of both proteins were extremely low without the inclusion of the plasmid containing the tRNA genes. For an average purification, HsRad52 and HsRad521–237 were purified from 5- and 1-liter cultures, respectively. All cultures were incubated at 30 °C. At the logarithmic phase of growth (A600 = 0.6), protein expression was induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (final concentration). The cells were harvested after 4–6 h of culture and were lysed by sonication in buffer A (pH 7.8) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.3 m KCl, 2 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitors (Complete EDTA-free; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) on ice. All manipulations after harvesting were done at 4 °C. The lysates were centrifuged at 27,700 × g for 20 min, and the supernatants were gently mixed by the batch method with 4 ml of Ni-NTA agarose beads (Qiagen) for 1 h. The HsRad52-coupled Ni-NTA-agarose beads were packed into Econo-columns (Bio-Rad) and were washed with 30 column volumes of buffer B (pH 7.8), which contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.3 m KCl, 2 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 50 mm imidazole, and 10% glycerol at a flow rate of about 0.3 ml/min. The HsRad52 proteins were eluted in a 30-column volume linear gradient from 50 to 300 mmimidazole. Peak fractions, which eluted at about 0.15 mimidazole, were collected, and 2 units of thrombin protease (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech)/mg of HsRad52 protein were added to remove the hexahistidine tag. Fractions were immediately dialyzed against buffer C (pH 7.5), which contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.2 mKCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol, for more than 12 h. After the removal of the hexahistidine tag, the HsRad52 proteins were loaded onto a 4-ml Heparin-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column was washed with 20 column volumes of buffer C, and the proteins were eluted with a 20-column volume linear gradient from 0.2 to 1 mKCl. HsRad52 and HsRad521–237 both eluted in sharp peaks at about 0.3 m KCl. The peak fractions of HsRad521–237, which had a concentration of 1–2 mg/ml, were dialyzed against buffer D (pH 7.0), which contained 20 mm Hepes-KOH, 0.2 m KCl, 0.5 mmEDTA, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 50% glycerol, and were stored at −20 °C. For HsRad52, the heparin-Sepharose peak fractions were dialyzed against buffer E (pH 7.5), which contained 20 mm potassium phosphate, 0.2 m KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol, and were applied to a 1-ml MonoS column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for concentration. The MonoS column was washed with buffer E and was eluted in a 20-ml linear gradient from 0.2 to 1 mKCl. The HsRad52 protein sharply eluted at about 0.3 m KCl. Peak fractions were collected, dialyzed against buffer D, and stored at −20 °C. For subsequent experiments, HsRad52 and HsRad521–237 were dialyzed against buffer F (pH 7.0), which contained 20 mm Hepes-KOH, 0.2 m KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit with bovine serum albumin (Pierce) as the standard. The HsRad51 expression vector was constructed as described (46Kurumizaka H. Aihara H. Kagawa W. Shibata T. Yokoyama S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 537-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Hexahistidine-tagged HsRad51 was overexpressed in E. colistrain JM109 (DE3) along with the tRNA described above. The culture conditions for HsRad51 were identical to those for HsRad52. The HsRad51 protein was purified from a 10-liter LB culture. Harvested cells were lysed by sonication in buffer G (pH 8.0), which contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 m NaCl, 5 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitors (Complete EDTA-free; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Lysates were mixed gently by the batch method with Ni-NTA-agarose beads at 4 °C for 1 h. The HsRad51-coupled Ni-NTA-agarose beads (4 ml) were then packed into an Econo-column (Bio-Rad) and were washed with 30 column volumes of buffer H (pH 8.0), which contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 m NaCl, 5 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 60 mm imidazole, and 10% glycerol, at a flow rate of about 0.3 ml/min. Hexahistidine-tagged HsRad51 was eluted in a 30-column volume linear gradient from 60 to 400 mmimidazole. HsRad51, which eluted in a broad peak, was collected, and was treated with 1 unit of thrombin protease (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech)/mg of HsRad51. The HsRad51 protein was immediately dialyzed against buffer I (pH 8.0), which contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.2 m KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 2 mm2-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol, at 4 °C. The HsRad51 protein precipitated overnight but redissolved after changing the dialysis buffer the following day. After more than 24 h of dialysis, the HsRad51 protein was collected and filtered to remove residual precipitates. About 20 mg of HsRad51, which was more than 99% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining, were then applied to a 1-ml MonoQ column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for concentration. The MonoQ column was washed with 20 ml of buffer I and was eluted with a 20-ml linear gradient from 0.2 to 0.6 mKCl. The HsRad51 protein sharply eluted between 0.3–0.4 mKCl, and peak fractions had concentrations of about 2 mg/ml. These fractions were dialyzed against buffer J (pH 8.0), which contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 m KCl, 0.5 mmEDTA, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol, and were used for subsequent studies. The protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit with bovine serum albumin (Pierce) as the standard. To prevent the dsDNA substrates used in the D loop formation from undergoing irreversible denaturation, alkaline treatment of the cells harboring the plasmid DNA was avoided. Instead, the cells were gently lysed using sarkosyll, as described (47Cunningham R.P. DasGupta C. Shibata T. Radding C.M. Cell. 1980; 20: 223-235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). pGsat4 was created by inserting a 198-base pair fragment of the human α-satellite sequence into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega). The resulting 3.2-kilobase plasmid DNA and the ΦX174 form I DNA were both prepared following the method described above. For the ssDNA substrates, the following high pressure liquid chromatography-purified oligonucleotides were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals: SAT-1 (50-mer, 5′-ATT TCA TGC TAG ACA GAA GAA TTC TCA GTA ACT TCT TTG TGC TGT GTG TA-3′) and ΦX-1 (50-mer, 5′-ATT TTG TTC ATG GTA GAG ATT CTC TTG TTG ACA TTT TAA AAG AGC GTG GA-3′). The 5′ ends of the oligonucleotides were labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP at 37 °C for 90 min. Labeled oligonucleotides were purified with Chromaspin-10 columns (CLONTECH). The TE buffer in the spin columns was exchanged with H2O prior to purification of the oligonucleotides. This allowed accurate absorbance readings of the purified oligonucleotides at 260 nm for concentration determination. HsRad52 (5 μl of 1–3 mg/ml) was mixed with 5 μl of 30 μg/ml proteinase K, and the mixture was incubated at 25 °C for 4–6 h. The proteinase K solution was diluted in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). The reaction mixture was fractionated by 12% SDS-PAGE, and the protein bands were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using a semi-wet blotting apparatus (Bio-Rad). Proteolytic bands were visualized by staining with a 100-fold diluted Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining solution, followed by a brief destaining of the membrane with methanol. Portions of the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane containing the bands were excised for N-terminal amino acid sequencing. For mass determination of the proteolytic fragments, the reaction mixture containing the proteolyzed HsRad52 was treated with 1 μl of 2n HCl to stop further proteolysis by proteinase K. The mixture was diluted 100-fold with H2O and was subjected to mass spectrometry. To maintain the activity of the HsRad52 proteins, the desired concentrations of the HsRad52 proteins were obtained by repeating 2-fold serial dilutions of the protein solution in buffer F. In the HsRad52-catalyzed homologous pairing reactions, the reaction mixture contained final concentrations of 50 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.5), 40 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2% glycerol, 1 μm ssDNA, 0.25–2 μm HsRad52, and 15 μm dsDNA. The initial 9 μl of the reaction mixture contained 2 μl of 5× reaction buffer (250 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.5), 5 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mmdithiothreitol), 1 μl of 32P-labeled ssDNA (10 μm), appropriate amounts of H2O, and 2 μl of HsRad52, which were mixed on ice. HsRad52 and ssDNA were preincubated for 5 min at 37 °C in this 9-μl reaction mixture. The reaction was initiated by adding 1 μl of 150 μm dsDNA. After a 10-min incubation, the reaction was stopped by adding 1 μl of 5% SDS, followed by immediately adding 1 μl of 6 mg/ml proteinase K (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The reaction mixtures were further incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. After adding the 6-fold loading dye (15% Ficoll, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 0.1% xylene cyanole), the reaction mixtures were subjected to 1% agarose gel electrophoresis (SeaKem GTG-agarose) in 0.5× TBE buffer. Electrophoresis was run at 3.3 V/cm at room temperature. The recombination products were visualized by autoradiography of the dried gel. Products and reactants were quantified using a Fuji BAS2500 image analyzer. Because the ssDNA is in excess, the yield of products was expressed as a percentage of the pGsat4 dsDNA incorporated into D-loops. The reaction mixture was essentially identical to that used in the assay for the D-loop formation to facilitate comparisons of the results. For the ssDNA binding, one volume of the 32P-labeled SAT-1 ssDNA (10 μm) was mixed with nine volumes of the nonlabeled SAT-1 ssDNA (10 μm) to dilute the 32P label 10-fold. After a 5-min incubation of HsRad52 and SAT-1 ssDNA (1 μm), 1 μl of a 2% glutaraldehyde solution was added to fix the HsRad52-ssDNA complex. The incubation was continued for 20 min. Afterward, the 6-fold loading dye was added, and the reaction mixtures were subjected to 1% agarose gel electrophoresis in 0.5× TBE buffer. Electrophoresis was run at 3.3 V/cm at room temperature. The resulting complexes were visualized by autoradiography of the dried gel. The amounts of free ssDNA were quantified using a Fuji BAS2500 image analyzer. For the dsDNA binding, HsRad52 was incubated with pGsat4 dsDNA (15 μm) for 5 min and subjected to 1% agarose gel electrophoresis without fixation of the complex. The complexes were visualized by ethidium bromide staining (0.5 μg/ml) of the gel. The amounts of free dsDNA were quantified using a MacBAS software. The ability of HsRad52 to bind to Affi-Gel 15-conjugated HsRad51 was observed. An Affi-Gel 15 slurry (250 μl; Bio-Rad) was washed two times with 0.5 ml of H2O, followed by three washes with 0.5 ml of buffer K (pH 8.0), which contained 20 mm Hepes-KOH, 0.1m KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 2 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, and 0.05% Triton X-100. The washed beads were mixed with 0.5 ml of 2.8 mg/ml HsRad51 and were incubated at 4 °C for 5 h. Afterward, the supernatant was removed, and the conjugated beads were washed six times with 0.5 ml of buffer L. The final concentration of HsRad51 conjugated to Affi-Gel 15, determined by the amount of unbound HsRad51, was 3.3 mg/ml. The Affi-Gel 15-HsRad51 matrix was adjusted to a 33% slurry with binding buffer and was stored at 4 °C. For the binding assay, 10 μg of Rad51 (30 μl of the slurry) were mixed with 20 μg of HsRad52 and HsRad521–237. The proteins were mixed at room temperature for 90 min. The unbound HsRad52 proteins were then removed, and the Affi-Gel-HsRad51 beads were washed six times with 0.5 ml of buffer L. SDS-PAGE sample buffer (10 μl of a 2-fold stock) was mixed directly with the washed beads. After heating the mixture at 98 °C for 2 min, the HsRad51 and the bound HsRad52 proteins were fractionated by 15–25% gradient SDS-PAGE. Bands were visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. A Superdex 200 HR 10/30 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used to determine the estimated molecular masses of the HsRad52 proteins. All gel filtrations were done in buffer F. For each injection, 0.1–0.2 ml of 1–2 mg/ml HsRad52 was used. To create a standard molecular mass curve, ferritin, aldolase, albumin, ovalbumin, and ribonuclease A (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were used. HsRad52 and HsRad521–237 and their complexes with ΦX174 circular ssDNA were negatively stained on a copper-plated carbon grid with 2% uranyl acetate. The proteins and complexes were observed with a JEOL JEM 2000FX electron microscope. We previously reported that HsRad52 catalyzes homologous pairing independently from HsRad51, as observed in the D-loop formation assay, which is a standard homologous pairing assay for RecA (9Shibata T. DasGupta C. Cunningham R.P. Radding C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1638-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). However, in those previous experiments, we used dsDNA substrates prepared by a method involving alkaline treatment (46Kurumizaka H. Aihara H. Kagawa W. Shibata T. Yokoyama S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 537-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), which may irreversibly denature the double helix of the dsDNA. To exclude the possibility of observing an annealing reaction between a denatured dsDNA and its homologous ssDNA, we prepared the dsDNA by a conventional method that does not involve alkaline treatment (47Cunningham R.P. DasGupta C. Shibata T. Radding C.M. Cell. 1980; 20: 223-235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and successfully reproduced the formation of D-loops by purified HsRad52 (Figs.1 A and2).Figure 2D-loop formed by HsRad52. A, a schematic diagram of the D-loop formation. B, the D-loops formed by HsRad52 (1 μm) and RecA (0.2 μm) migrated the same distance on a 1% agarose gel. The HsRad52 and RecA proteins were reacted in the presence of 10 mmMgCl2, which is required for the optimal activity of the RecA protein. ATP was omitted from the reaction containing HsRad52. In the reaction, a 50-mer ssDNA (1 μm), which was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP, was first incubated with HsRad52 or RecA in the reaction mixture containing 1 mmMgCl2. The reaction was initiated by adding pGsat4 dsDNA (final concentration, 15 μm) and MgCl2 (final concentration, 10 mm). The products were not observed without the proteins (lane 1) or without ATP in the presence of RecA (lane 2). The D-loops formed by HsRad52 dissociated when treated with either the NheI, PstI, orScaI restriction enzyme for 30 min at 37 °C (lanes 5–7). Each enzyme cuts the dsDNA at a single, nonhomologous site.C, the HsRad52 protein catalyzed the formation of D-loops in a homology-dependent manner. pGsat4 (3.2 kilobases, 15 μm) and ΦX174 dsDNA (5.4 kilobases, 15 μm) and their homologous ssDNAs (1 μm) were used as DNA substrates. Without HsRad52, D-loop products were not observed with either homologous combination of the DNA substrates (lanes 1 and 2). In the presence of HsRad52 (1 μm), D-loops were observed in homologous combinations that have migration distances corresponding to the length of the dsDNA (lanes 3 and 4). HsRad52 was unable to catalyze any D-loops between heterologous combinations of the DNA substrates (lanes 5 and 6).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The use of this DNA substrate now allowed us to characterize the homologous pairing activity of HsRad52. In the reaction, a 50-mer oligonucleotide was preincubated with HsRad52, and then the dsDNA was added to initiate the reaction. The migration distance of the reaction product on the agarose gel was identical to that of the D-loop product formed by RecA (Fig. 2 B, lanes 3 and4). When the superhelical tension in the D-loops was released by cutting the dsDNA with restriction enzymes at sites outside the homologous region, the D-loops dissociated by spontaneous branch migration, as in the case of authentic D-loops formed by RecA or a nonenzymatic method (48Holloman W.K. Wiegand R. Hoessli C. Radding C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 2394-2398Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 49Shibata T. Ohtani T. Chang P.K. Ando T. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 370-376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 B, lanes 5–7). These two results indicate that the D-loop formed by HsRad52 has the same physical characteristics as that formed by RecA. The HsRad52-catalyzed D-loop formation was a homology-dependent reaction. When ΦX174 dsDNA, which was also prepared by the conventional method, and its homologous ssDNA were used as D-loop substrates, HsRad52 formed D-loops with an efficiency similar to that of the pGsat4 DNA substrates (Fig. 2 C,lanes 3 and 4). In contrast, no D-loops were formed between heterologous combinations of the DNA substrates (Fig.2 C, lanes 5 and 6). The HsRad52 protein converted more than 10% of the dsDNA into D-loops when HsRad52 was preincubated with ssDNA followed by the addition of dsDNA (Fig. 3, A an"

S100B protein associates with both the p53 oligomerization domain (residues 325–355) and the extreme C terminus of the tumor suppressor p53 (residues 367–392). Consequently, S100B inhibits p53 tetramer formation and p53 phosphorylation mediated by protein kinase C, on p53 C-terminal end. In this report, we show that the S100B protein decreases p53 DNA binding and transcriptional activity. The effect of S100B is reflected in vivo by a reduced accumulation of p53, p21, and MDM2 protein levels in co-transfection assays and in response to bleomycin. The S100B can still interact with p53 in the absence of p53 extreme C-terminal end and reduce the expression of p53 downstream effector genes. These data indicate that S100B does not require p53 extreme C-terminal end to inhibit p53 activity. Collectively, these findings imply that elevated levels of S100B in tumors such as astrocytomas and gliomas could inhibit p53 functions and contribute to cancer progression.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1965; 19: 739-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar). Deregulation of Ca2+ homeostasis has been associated with different pathologies including neurodegenerative disorders, hypertension, and cancer (2Schafer B.W. Heizmann C.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 134-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar). The S100 proteins are overexpressed in many tumor cells and have been used as a marker for the classification of tumors (3Pedrocchi M. Schafer B.W. Mueller H. Eppenberger U. Heizmann C.W. Int. J. Cancer. 1994; 57: 684-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). A possible role for the S100 proteins in carcinogenesis has often been suspected, but their specific involvement is still ill defined. Evidence has indicated that S100B interacts with the tumor suppressor p53 (4Baudier J. Delphin C. Grunwald D. Khochbin S. Lawrence J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11627-11631Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). p53 plays a pivotal role in the maintenance and regulation of normal cellular functions, and its inactivation can affect cell cycle checkpoints, apoptosis, gene amplification, centrosome duplication, and ploidy (5Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2292) Google Scholar). p53 interacts with a number of proteins to mediate its pleiotropic effects. The interactions of p53 with S100 calcium-binding proteins are of particular interest because like p53, the S100 proteins affect cell cycle progression, are overexpressed in numerous tumor cells, and are associated with tumor progression (2Schafer B.W. Heizmann C.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 134-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar). The S100B protein interacts with the p53 C-terminal end and inhibits both,p53 tetramerization and phosphorylation by PKC1 (4Baudier J. Delphin C. Grunwald D. Khochbin S. Lawrence J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11627-11631Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Because these two events are known to be important for p53 activation (6Giaccia A.J. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2973-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar), we wanted to determine the effect of S100B on p53 transcriptional activity in vivo. Our data indicate that overexpression of S100B can reduce p53 transcriptional activity by more than 50%. This effect is correlated with a decrease in p53 DNA binding activity and a reduction in the accumulation of MDM2 and p21 protein levels. Interaction of the S100B protein with p53 may thus impede p53 cellular functions. Such an interaction could especially be detrimental in astrocytomas and gliomas, where S100B levels are significantly elevated (7Castets F. Griffin W.S. Marks A. Van Eldik L.J. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 46: 208-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The human large cell lung carcinoma cells H1299 and the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 were grown in RPMI (Life Technologies, Rockville, MD) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. For CAT assay, MCF-7 transfection, and mobility shift assay, a fixed amount of plasmid (10 μg) was transfected by the LipofectAMINE technique (Life Technologies). The pCMV3 vector, without insert, was used to normalize the amount of plasmid transfected. The pG13CAT and the p53 expression vector, SN3, were provided by Bert Vogelstein (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD). These plasmids have been described previously (8Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Thiagalingam S. Seymour A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1992; 256: 827-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). The p53Δ30 plasmid (expressing amino acid residues 1–363 of p53) was constructed by conventional polymerase chain reaction amplification of the 1–1092 sequence of the human p53 cDNA and subcloned in the HindIII-XhoI sites of the pCMV3 expression vector. The p53Δ66 plasmid (expressing amino acid residues 1–327 of p53) and the KEEK plasmid (containing four point mutations; residues 341 (F→K), 344 (L→E), 348 (L→E), and 355 (A→K) in the p53 oligomerization domain) were provided by Karen Vousden (NCI, National Institutes of Health, Frederick, MD). The Gadd153 expression vector, pCMV153, was provided by Al Fornace (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) and has been described previously (9Zhan Q. Lord K.A. Alamo Jr., I. Hollander M.C.

The S100B expression vector, pCMV5-βSense, was constructed by polymerase chain reaction cloning of the open reading frame region from human cDNA clone for S100B (10Van Eldik L.J. Staecker J.L. Winningham-Major F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7830-7837Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) into theEcoRI and HindIII sites of the pCMV5 vector. The cells were plated at 5 × 105 cells/100-mm dish the day before transfection. A mixture of lipids (LipofectAMINE) and plasmid DNA was then added to the cells according to the manufacturer's procedure. Fresh media was added to the cells 5 h after transfection, and the cells were harvested 48 h later. A β-galactosidase expression vector (PCH110, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was also transfected in all the samples and used as an internal control to normalize transfection efficiency. The cellular proteins were extracted by three rounds of freeze-thaw of the cellular pellets in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The protein extracts were analyzed for their content of β-galactosidase and the CAT activity was measured. The CAT assay was determined according to established protocol (11Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5294) Google Scholar). The levels of acetylation were evaluated by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) using the ImageQuant software. Where indicated cells were treated with bleomycin (ICN Pharmaceutical Inc., Costa Mesa, CA) 10 μg/ml for 4 h before harvesting. Co-transfection for Western blot analysis was performed in a 150-mm dish with 12 μg of plasmid. A ratio of three times (9 μg) S100B plasmid versus p53 (3 μg) was used. Forin vitro translation, all inserts were subcloned in to pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The p53 and Δ30 inserts were subcloned in the HindIII-XhoI sites by polymerase chain reaction. The S100B was first cloned into pCMV-Myc vector (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) intoSalI-XhoI sites then subcloned in to pcDNA3.1 vector in to HindIII-XhoI sites. The mobility shift assay was performed as described previously (12Kastan M.B. Zhan Q. el-Deiry W.S. Carrier F. Jacks T. Walsh W.V. Plunkett B.S. Vogelstein B. Fornace Jr., A.J. Cell. 1992; 71: 587-597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2930) Google Scholar) with the exception that the running buffer contained 1 mm Ca2+ instead of EDTA, and the binding buffer was 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5),4 mmdithiotreitol,200 mm NaCl,2 mmCaCl2,10% glycerol. The human p53 protein extracts were obtained from Sf9 insect cells infected with a p53 baculovirus expression vector (13Pietenpol J.A. Tokino T. Thiagalingam S. el-Deiry W.S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1998-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). The infected cells were lysed by three rounds of freeze-thaw in 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.9),10 mm KCl,1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride,1.5 mm MgCl2,1.0 mm DTT,2 μg/ml leupeptine,2 μg/ml aprotinin. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation, and the supernatant was used for band shift analysis. Alternatively, 5 μl of in vitro translated p53 reaction or 15 μl of in vitro translated S100B (see below) were used. The p53 deletion mutant protein extracts were obtained by extraction of the cellular proteins after transient transfection of the H1299 cells as described above (CAT assays). The S100B recombinant protein was produced and purified as described previously (14Wilder P.T. Rustandi R.R. Drohat A.C. Weber D.J. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 794-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The protein extracts were incubated with a radiolabeled 30-mer double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotide containing the sequence of the p53 binding site found in the third intron (+1569 to +1598) of theGADD45 gene (12Kastan M.B. Zhan Q. el-Deiry W.S. Carrier F. Jacks T. Walsh W.V. Plunkett B.S. Vogelstein B. Fornace Jr., A.J. Cell. 1992; 71: 587-597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2930) Google Scholar). The assay was performed in the absence and presence of p53 antibody (pAb421, Oncogene Science) and in the presence of increasing amounts of recombinant S100B protein. For the p53 interaction with S100B, the p53 extracts were incubated with the S100B recombinant protein for 15 min at room temperature, then the DNA probe was added, and the reaction was allowed to proceed for an additional 15 min. For experiments performed in the presence of the p53 antibody, the S100B recombinant protein was first incubated for 5 min with p53 containing protein extracts, the p53 antibody was then added, and the reaction was continued for 5 min. After adding the DNA probe, the reaction was allowed to proceed an additional 15 min. The mixtures were then run on a 4.5% non-denaturant polyacrylamide gel. The gel was dried and exposed to x-ray film. Densitometry analyses were performed with a chilled charge-couple device video camera (Nucleo Vision, Gel Expert software) and competition was calculated as a ratio of the intensity in the supershifted band compared with the total intensity in a given lane. The ratio obtained for the band shifted by the p53Ab in the absence of S100B protein was considered 100%. The Western blot analyses were performed on 100 μg of MCF-7 protein extracts or on 100 μg of H1299 protein extracts. The MCF-7 cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS). The H1299 cells were lysed in RIPA buffer containing 50 mm NaF, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. The proteins were run on a 12% polyacrylamide gel, transferred on nitrocellulose, and reacted with either p53 mouse monoclonal antibody (DO-1, Oncogene Research Products, Boston, MA) at 1:1000 dilution, p21 rabbit polyclonal antibody (PharMingen, San Diego, CA) at 1:1000, MDM2 mouse monoclonal antibody (Oncogene Research Products) at 1:100 dilution, actin mouse monoclonal antibody (Oncogene Research Products) at 1:5000 dilution to control for even protein loading, or S100B rabbit polyclonal antibody (Swant, Bellinzona, Switzerland) at 1:500 dilution. The blots were then reacted with their respective secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and reacted with a chemiluminescence substrate (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as recommended by the manufacturer. In vitro translation was performed in rabbit reticulocyte according to the manufacturer recommendation (TNT Coupled Transcription/Translation Systems, Promega, Madison, WI). Circular plasmids containing a T7 promoter were used for RNA synthesis. [35S]methionine (Redivuel-[35S]methionine, AG1094, 370MBq/ml, 10mCi/ml) was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. In vitrotranslation was performed with the following plasmids: pcDNA-Myc, pcDNA3.1-Myc-S100B, pcDNA3.1-p53, and pcDNA3.1-p53Δ30. The pcDNA3.1-Myc-S100B translation mixture (20 μl) or the pcDNA3.1-Myc translation mixture (20 μl) was combined with either the pcDNA-p53 translation mixture (20 μl) or the pcDNA-p53Δ30 mixture (20 μl). Sixty μl of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm DTT, 2 mm CaCl2) and 2 μl of c-Myc monoclonal antibody (200 μg/ml) was added to each mixture. The reactions were mixed gently at 4 °C for 2 h. Then, 20 μl of protein A/G Plus-Agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was added to each reaction and mixed gently at 4 °C overnight. The agarose beads were then washed three times with buffer A. Sample buffer (40 μl of 125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 4% β-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol, 0.1% Bromphenol Blue) was then added to the beads. An aliquot (2.5 μl) of each reaction prior to immunoprecipitation was also dissolved in the sample buffer. The samples were heated at 100 °C for 5 min and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatants were then loaded on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gel was fixed (50% methanol, 10% glacial acetic acid, 40% water) for 30 min and soaked in Amplify (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 15–30 min with gentle mixing. The gel was dried under vacuum at 80 °C for 1 h and exposed to x-ray film at −70 °C overnight. Early studies (15Hupp T.R. Meek D.W. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Cell. 1992; 71: 875-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar) have shown that modulation of the p53 C-terminal end by either an antibody directed against this domain or truncation of p53 C-terminal end was sufficient to activate p53 DNA binding activity. Because S100B interacts with both the p53 C-terminal end (residues 367–392) (4Baudier J. Delphin C. Grunwald D. Khochbin S. Lawrence J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11627-11631Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 16Rustandi R.R. Baldisseri D.M. Weber D.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 570-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) and its oligomerization domain (residues 325–355) (17Delphin C. Ronjat M. Deloulme J.C. Garin G. Debussche L. Higashimoto Y. Sakaguchi K. Baudier J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10539-10544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), we wanted to evaluate its effect on p53 DNA binding activity. The data presented in Fig. 1 A indicate that, as reported before (18Sheikh M.S. Carrier F. Johnson A.C. Ogdon S.E. Fornace Jr., A.J. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1095-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), the p53-infected Sf9 protein extracts contain proteins that can bind constitutively to p53 DNA binding sites (lane 2). Addition of pAb421 leads to the formation of a new complex (15Hupp T.R. Meek D.W. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Cell. 1992; 71: 875-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar) of slower mobility than the protein extract alone (lanes 3–7). Addition of increasing amounts of S100B protein progressively decreases the intensity of this complex (lanes 4–6) as well as the constitutive binding. Densitometry analyses indicate that the p53 DNA binding activity can be reduced by 48% in the presence of 100 μg of S100B (lane 6) suggesting that S100B and the pAb421 compete for the same or an overlapping site on p53. A similar amount of bovine serum albumin (lane 7) did not affect the specific p53 DNA binding activity induced by p53 antibody but reduced the constitutive binding. To determine whether p53 DNA binding activity could be reduced with smaller amounts of S100B protein we used in vitro translated protein extracts. The data presented in Fig. 1 B indicate that no constitutive binding (lane 2) can be detected in these extracts and that the S100B extract had no binding activity on its own (lanes 3, 5). However, the addition of three times as much S100B than p53 extract (lane 6) competed p53 DNA binding activity by 37%. Assuming that the same amount of protein was made in each extract, this represents a 16:1 molar ratio of S100B/p53. This ratio is much less than what is expected for anin vivo setting where S100B molar concentration (100 pmol/mg, (19Fan K. Brain Res. 1982; 237: 498-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar)) can be estimated at 1000 to 4000 times higher than p53 concentration (24.5–73.5 fmol/mg, (20Hassapoglidou S. Diamandis E.P. Sutherland D.J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1501-1509PubMed Google Scholar)). Moreover, we could not detect p53 DNA binding activity in the absence of p53 antibody (lanes 2), and thus S100B had to compete with the antibody to decrease the binding activity. The data presented above indicate that the S100B inhibitory effect on p53 DNA binding activity is specific and has the potential to be significant in vivo. To determine whether S100B reduces p53 DNA binding activity by interacting with p53 C-terminal end or its oligomerization domain, we performed DNA band shift with H1299 protein extracts containing different p53 deletion mutants (Fig.2 A). The H1299 cells have been selected for their null p53 genotype (9Zhan Q. Lord K.A. Alamo Jr., I. Hollander M.C. Carrier F. Ron D. Kohn K.W. Hoffman B. Liebermann D.A. Fornace Jr., A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2361-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar), they lack endogenous expression of either wild type or mutant p53 protein. To facilitate the detection of p53 DNA binding activity in the absence of p53 antibody, we increased the concentration of DTT to 10 mm in the reaction buffer (21Jayaraman L. Murthy K.G. Zhu C. Curran T. Xanthoudakis S. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 558-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). The data presented in Fig. 2 B indicate that as expected, deletion of p53 oligomerization domain (Δ66,lane 3) or insertion of a point mutation that prevents p53 oligomerization (KEEK, lane 4) (22Marston N.J. Jenkins J.R. Vousden K.H. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1709-1715PubMed Google Scholar) abolishes p53 DNA binding activity. However, as reported before (21Jayaraman L. Murthy K.G. Zhu C. Curran T. Xanthoudakis S. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 558-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar), deletion of p53 C-terminal end (Δ30, lane 2) markedly increase p53 DNA binding activity (compare with lane 1). Addition of the S100B protein (lanes 5–8) reduces the DNA binding activity of the p53 C-terminal deletion mutant (Δ30, lane 6) by 37%. This reduction is in the same range as what was observed with the full-length p53 protein in the presence of p53 antibody (Fig. 1). These data indicate that S100B reduction of p53 DNA binding activity does not require p53 extreme C-terminal end. S100B has been shown to inhibit in vitro phosphorylation of p53 C-terminal end (14Wilder P.T. Rustandi R.R. Drohat A.C. Weber D.J. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 794-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and to disrupt p53 tetramers (4Baudier J. Delphin C. Grunwald D. Khochbin S. Lawrence J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11627-11631Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), two functions important for p53 transcriptional activity (6Giaccia A.J. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2973-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar). The reduced p53 DNA binding activity observed in the presence of S100B (Figs. 1 and 2) suggests that in addition to inhibiting phosphorylation and preventing tetramer formation, S100B could affect p53 transcriptional activity. To verify this possibility we performed transient transfections with S100B and p53 expression vectors concomitantly with a p53 reporter gene construct (pG13-CAT) (8Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Thiagalingam S. Seymour A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1992; 256: 827-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar) in H1299 human large cell lung carcinoma cells. The data presented in Fig. 3 indicate that as reported before (8Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Thiagalingam S. Seymour A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1992; 256: 827-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar), co-transfection of a p53 expression vector with a p53 reporter gene construct results in transcriptional activation of the reporter gene (Fig. 3, lane 6). Under the conditions used, about 17% of the substrate was converted. Transfection of S100B alone did not affect the reporter gene (lane 4), but co-transfection of S100B with p53 reduced the transcriptional activity by more than 50% (lane 7). When the p53 expression vector was co-transfected with an expression vector for an unrelated protein (Gadd153, lane 8) no effect was observed on p53 transcriptional activity indicating that the effect of S100B on p53 transcriptional activity is specific. We also transfected the cells with p53 Δ66 and KEEK constructs in the presence or absence of S100B. Even though p53 monomers have been reported to retain their transcriptional activity (23Tarunina M. Jenkins J.R. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3165-3173PubMed Google Scholar), we did not detect any transcriptional activity with the constructs used here (data not shown). This is probably due to the fact that we used a different reporter construct and a different cell line. Nevertheless, the data presented above indicate that S100B is likely to interact with p53 in vivoand decrease its transcriptional activity. To assess the significance of S100B interaction with p53, we measured the protein levels of p53 and two of its downstream effector genes, MDM2 and p21. We first co-transfected transiently the human large cell lung carcinoma cells H1299 with p53 and S100B expression vectors (Fig.4 A). To emphasis the effect of S100B and to mimic the overexpression of S100B observed in certain tumors (7Castets F. Griffin W.S. Marks A. Van Eldik L.J. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 46: 208-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), we used a ratio of three times more S100B plasmid than p53 DNA. The total amount of plasmid DNA was maintained constant with the empty vector pCMV3. No apoptosis was detected under the conditions used here (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 4 A, p53 was not detected in the absence of p53 expression vector (lanes, 1, 2). Consequently, the levels of MDM2 and p21 proteins were low in the absence of p53 expression (lanes 1, 2). As expected, expression of p53 triggered expression of MDM2 and p21 (lane 3) but co-expression with the S100B protein reduced markedly the accumulation of p53, MDM2, and p21 protein levels (lane 4). As reported previously (21Jayaraman L. Murthy K.G. Zhu C. Curran T. Xanthoudakis S. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 558-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar), expression of p53 C-terminal deletion mutant (Δ30) resulted in increased levels of p53 downstream effector genes (lane 5). Co-expression of S100B with p53Δ30 reduced to near basal levels the expression of p53Δ30, MDM2, and p21 protein levels (lane 6). This inhibitory effect of S100B is dose-dependent because a more subtle effect was observed with a one to one ratio of S100B versus p53 plasmid (data not shown). Expression of S100B alone (lane 2) in the absence of p53 did not affect significantly the basal levels of MDM2 or p21. The S100B protein is not expressed endogenously in H1299 cells (Fig. 4A, lane 1). Our data suggest that reduction of p53, MDM2, and p21 levels is dependent on S100B interaction with p53 but does not require the p53 extreme C-terminal end. The effect of S100B on p53 mutants lacking the oligomerization domain (Δ66) or having point mutations in the oligomerization domain (KEEK) could not be verified in this assay since none of these mutants induced p53 downstream effector genes (data not shown). These results are in good agreement with our data presented in Fig. 2, where S100B did not require p53 C-terminal end to reduce p53 DNA binding activity. We then asked whether S100B could also interact with the endogenous p53 protein and affect the expression of MDM2 and p21. The human breast cancer cell line MCF-7, which has a wild type p53 genotype (24O'Connor P.M. Jackman J. Bae I. Myers T.G. Fan S. Mutoh M. Scudiero D.A. Monks A. Sausville E.A. Weinstein J.N. Friend S. Fornace Jr., A.J. Kohn K.W. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4285-4300PubMed Google Scholar), was transiently transfected with S100B. In this experiment we used three times less S100B plasmid than in Fig. 4 A. Forty eight hours after transfection the cells were either left untreated or treated with the x-ray mimic agent bleomycin. The data presented in Fig.4 B indicate that the basal levels of p53, MDM2 and p21 can be induced by exposure to bleomycin (lane 2). Endogenous levels of S100B are undetectable in MCF-7 cells (lane 1), whereas over-expression of S100B protein reduces the induced levels of p53 and almost completely blocked MDM2 and p21 accumulation (lane 4). Even loading was verified by incubating the blots with an anti-actin antibody and indicates that over-expression of S100B does not affect the overall levels of protein (compare lane 1with lane 3 and lane 2 with lane 4). These data suggest that S100B can inhibit the endogenous expression of p53 downstream effector genes in vivo. The data presented in Figs. 2 and 4 suggest that S100B could interact with p53 in the absence of the p53 extreme C-terminal end and inhibit its transcriptional activity. To verify this possibility we performed co-immunoprecipitation with in vitro translated proteins. To increase the antibody specificity for the S100B protein, we fused a c-Myc epitope tag to the N terminus of S100B. The data presented in Fig. 5indicate that in vitro translation of each product generated a protein of expected size (lanes 1–3). The in vitro translated proteins were mixed and incubated as indicated in Fig. 5. Immunoprecipitation of the mixture with a c-Myc antibody pulled down, as expected, the c-Myc-S100B protein (lanes 4–6). The antibody also pulled down the p53 full-length protein (lane 5) as well as the p53Δ30 mutant (lane 6) in the presence of c-Myc-S100B protein. No significant amounts of proteins were pulled down in the absence of c-Myc-S100B (lanes 7, 8). A negative control, performed with an unrelated antibody (A18 polyclonal), did not pull down any of the in vitrotranslated protein (data not shown). These data indicate that S100B can interact with p53 even in the absence of its extreme C-terminal end. In this report, we present evidence that S100B can reduce p53 DNA binding and transcriptional activity. S100B interacts with the p53 C-terminal end and inhibits both p53 tetramerization and phosphorylation in vitro (4Baudier J. Delphin C. Grunwald D. Khochbin S. Lawrence J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11627-11631Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 14Wilder P.T. Rustandi R.R. Drohat A.C. Weber D.J. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 794-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 16Rustandi R.R. Baldisseri D.M. Weber D.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 570-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). These two events are known to be important for p53 transcriptional activation (6Giaccia A.J. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2973-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar) and suggest that in vivo S100B could interfere with p53 functions. Our data (Fig. 1) indicate that recombinant S100B protein reduces p53 DNA binding activity stimulated by an antibody (pAb421) directed against the residues 371–380 of the p53 C-terminal end. These data suggested that S100B competes with the p53 antibody pAb421 binding site. This possibility is supported by a recent NMR study (16Rustandi R.R. Baldisseri D.M. Weber D.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 570-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) showing a direct interaction between S100B and a p53 peptide (residues 367–388) derived from the p53 C-terminal end, which overlaps with the pAb421 epitope (residues 371–380). However, in contrast to pAb421, S100B does not stimulate p53 DNA binding activity (Fig. 2). This would suggest that the S100B interaction with the p53 C-terminal end is different from the interaction with the pAb421. In fact, S100B forms dimers (16Rustandi R.R. Baldisseri D.M. Weber D.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 570-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) and also interacts with the p53 oligomerization domain (17Delphin C. Ronjat M. Deloulme J.C. Garin G. Debussche L. Higashimoto Y. Sakaguchi K. Baudier J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10539-10544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The occupation of both sites, oligomerization and C-terminal end, by S100B could thus lead to disruption of the p53 tetramer formation and reduction of p53 DNA binding activity (Figs. 1 and 2). A transition of the p53 latent form to the active DNA binding form mediated by pAb421 has been shown to occur for p53 tetramers (25Waterman J.L. Shenk J.L. Halazonetis T.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 512-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). By inhibiting p53 tetramer formation and occupying the C-terminal end, S100B may interfere with the p53 activation and reduce DNA binding activity (Fig.1). This hypothesis is supported by the more than 50% reduction of p53 transcriptional activity measured in the presence of S100B (Fig. 3). However, the reduction of p53 DNA binding activity observed in the absence of p53 extreme C-terminal end (Fig. 2) suggests that interaction with the p53 C-terminal end alone is not sufficient to mediate the S100B inhibitory effect. Our data indicate that the p53 extreme C-terminal end is not required for interaction with S100B (Fig. 5) or reduction of p53 downstream effector genes accumulation (Fig. 4 A). It is possible thatin vivo, modifications of p53 C-terminal end hinders S100B binding. The extreme p53 C-terminal end (residues 367–392) contains several phosphorylation and acetylation sites important for p53 functions. A recent analysis by NMR (16Rustandi R.R. Baldisseri D.M. Weber D.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 570-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) has indicated that S100B sterically blocks two important PKC phosphorylation sites (Ser-376 and Thr-377). This study (16Rustandi R.R. Baldisseri D.M. Weber D.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 570-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), performed on non-phosphorylated peptide, could either explain the inhibitory effect of S100B on p53 phosphorylation by PKC (4Baudier J. Delphin C. Grunwald D. Khochbin S. Lawrence J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11627-11631Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 14Wilder P.T. Rustandi R.R. Drohat A.C. Weber D.J. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 794-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) or indicate that phosphorylation of these sites may change the interaction. A recent report (26Youmell M. Park S.J. Basu S. Price B.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 514-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) has indicated that p53 mutation at these PKC phosphorylation sites (S376A and T377A) reduces p53 transcriptional activity by ∼38 and 51% respectively. This is very similar to what we observed here when we transfected p53 with S100B (Fig. 3). Moreover, mutation at Ser-378, another PKC site on p53, did not affect p53 transcriptional activity (26Youmell M. Park S.J. Basu S. Price B.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 514-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This Ser is well exposed and not blocked by S100B (16Rustandi R.R. Baldisseri D.M. Weber D.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 570-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The level of p53 C-terminal end phosphorylation could thus influence the interaction with S100B and explain the partial inhibitory effect encountered in vivo. Alternatively, interaction of other regulatory proteins such as XP-B, XP-D, or Ref-1 (21Jayaraman L. Murthy K.G. Zhu C. Curran T. Xanthoudakis S. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 558-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar) with p53 C-terminal end may reduce S100B interaction with p53 and explain why only a partial inhibitory effect is observed. As mentioned earlier, S100B inhibits p53 phosphorylation by PKC and formation of p53 oligomers. These two activities may actually be link because phosphorylation of p53 by another kinase, hCHK1, requires that p53 be oligomeric (27Shieh S.Y. Ahn J. Tamai K. Taya Y. Prives C. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 289-300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, co-transfection of p53 with antisense hCHK1 reduces p53 levels (27Shieh S.Y. Ahn J. Tamai K. Taya Y. Prives C. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 289-300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This is reminiscent of what we are observing with S100B (Fig. 4). By preventing oligomerization of p53, S100B could reduce phosphorylation and stabilization of p53 by not only PKC but also by other kinases such as hCHK1 (27Shieh S.Y. Ahn J. Tamai K. Taya Y. Prives C. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 289-300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This possibility seems very likely because S100B also reduces the accumulation of p53 Δ30, which lacks the PKC phosphorylation site (Fig.4 A). Regardless of the mechanism(s) involved, our findings indicate that S100B prevents p53 from regulating its downstream effector genes (Fig.4) and could consequently alter p53 cellular functions. Our data seem to oppose a recent report (28Scotto C. Deloulme J.C. Rousseau D. Chambaz E. Baudier J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4272-4281Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) describing the cooperation of S100B with p53-mediated cellular functions. The study presented by Baudier's team (28Scotto C. Deloulme J.C. Rousseau D. Chambaz E. Baudier J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4272-4281Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) used a temperature sensitive mutant (p53Val135) transfected in rodent cells. In such a system, a mixture of p53 wild type and mutant conformation exists. Since the p53 mutation is localized at amino acid 135 and that S100B interacts with p53 at the C-terminal end between amino acid residues 319–393, it seems probable that S100B can not discriminate between the two p53 forms. The effects observed by this group could simply be due to the release of wild type p53 molecules from p53 wild type-mutant heterodimers and not be a direct effect of S100B on p53 activity. The cell line used here, H1299, has a null genotype for p53 (12Kastan M.B. Zhan Q. el-Deiry W.S. Carrier F. Jacks T. Walsh W.V. Plunkett B.S. Vogelstein B. Fornace Jr., A.J. Cell. 1992; 71: 587-597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2930) Google Scholar), therefore the only p53 present in our system was the wild type form (full-length or deletions) that we transfected. Moreover, as mentioned above, the interaction of S100B with p53 has been shown to disrupt p53 oligomerization and phosphorylation (4Baudier J. Delphin C. Grunwald D. Khochbin S. Lawrence J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11627-11631Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Because those two events are known to be important for p53 activation (6Giaccia A.J. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2973-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar), one may anticipate that interaction with the S100B protein would interfere with p53 cellular functions. The data presented here and the observations mentioned above (16Rustandi R.R. Baldisseri D.M. Weber D.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 570-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 26Youmell M. Park S.J. Basu S. Price B.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 514-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) support the idea that S100B inhibits p53 activity. Moreover, a recent report (29Grigorian M. Andresen S. Tulchinsky E. Kriajevska M. Carlberg C. Kruse C. Cohn M. Ambartsumian N. Christensen A. Selivanova G. Lukanidin E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 5: 5Google Scholar) has indicated that S100A4, another member of the S100 protein family decreased p53 DNA binding and transcriptional activity. In summary, our data indicate that S100B inhibits p53 functions. The p53 extreme C-terminal end is not required for this effect. Since S100B has been shown to interact with p53 oligomerization domain and prevent the formation of oligomers (4Baudier J. Delphin C. Grunwald D. Khochbin S. Lawrence J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11627-11631Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), this mechanism is a likely explanation for the inhibitory effect observed here. However, we can not rule out the possibility that other p53 domains are involved. S100B is a very abundant protein expressed at high levels in certain tumors (7Castets F. Griffin W.S. Marks A. Van Eldik L.J. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 46: 208-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), its inhibitory effect on the low abundance p53 tumor suppressor protein may contribute to cancer progression.

One of these is to increase the NPo of BK1 channels (2Valverde M.A. Rojas P. Amigo J. Cosmelli D. Orio P. Bahamonde M.I. Mann G.E. Vergara C. Latorre R.

Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1997; 20: 91-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). BK channels are composed of α and β subunits. The α subunit forms the K+-selective pore, while β subunits influence the pharmacology, kinetics, and voltage/Ca2+-sensitivity of BK channels. The β1 subunit of smooth muscle BK channels is physiologically important because knockout mice lacking this subunit are hypertensive and demonstrate altered vascular reactivity (4Brenner R. Perez G.J. Bonev A.D. Eckman D.M. Kosek J.C. Wiler S.W. Patterson A.J. Nelson M.T. Aldrich R.W. Nature. 2000; 407: 870-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar,5Pluger S. Faulhaber J.

Recent studies suggest that BK channels are potential targets for 17βE and xenoestrogens. BK channel NPo is increased by 17βE, an effect that requires the regulatory β1 subunit (2Valverde M.A. Rojas P. Amigo J. Cosmelli D. Orio P. Bahamonde M.I. Mann G.E. Vergara C. Latorre R.

Steinert J.R. Valverde M.A. Jacob R. Mann G.E. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 613-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The pharmacological nature of the putative 17βE-binding site on the smooth muscle BK β1 subunit is unknown. The xenoestrogen Tx, a commonly used chemotherapeutic agent, is an antagonist of the nuclear estrogen receptor (7Jordan V.C. Cancer Treat. Rep. 1976; 60: 1409-1419PubMed Google Scholar). It is not known, however, if this clinically important drug increases BK channel NPo. We investigated whether Tx increases BK channel NPo in smooth muscle cells and whether the β1 subunit is important for this effect. These findings give insight into BK channel structure and function, non-genomic regulation by xenoestrogens, and Tx-induced side effects. Smooth muscle cells were isolated by enzymatic dispersion described previously (8Dick G.M. Kong I.D. Sanders K.M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 127: 1819-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Dogs were anesthetized with ketamine, and the colon was removed via a midline incision. Mice were anesthetized with chloroform and killed by cervical dislocation. Human tissue samples were obtained from consenting patients undergoing gastric bypass for the treatment of morbid obesity. Circular muscle of the canine colon and human jejunum was dissected free of mucosa, submucosa, and longitudinal muscle in Ca2+-free Hanks solution. Strips of muscle were treated with collagenase (345 units/ml; Worthington Biochemical Corp.; Freehold, NJ) in Ca2+-free Hanks at 37 °C to produce suspensions of single cells by gentle stirring. Mouse colon (circular and longitudinal muscle layers) was dissected free of mucosa prior to enzymatic dispersion. Mouse aorta and canine mesenteric vein were enzymatically digested without further dissection. HEK293 cells (ATCC cell line number CRL-1573; Manassas, VA) were grown in glutamax-supplemented RPMI medium (Life Technologies, Inc., Manassas, VA) with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum (Summit Biotechnology; Fort Collins, CO) in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. cDNA encoding the α and β1 subunits from canine colonic smooth was cloned into the pZEOSV mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen; Carlsbad, CA) as described previously (9Vogalis F. Vincent T. Qureshi I. Schmalz F. Ward M.W. Sanders K.M. Horowitz B. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: G629-G639PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were transiently transfected via electroporation with a total of 40 μg of plasmid DNA encoding either the α subunit alone or with a 1:1 mix of plasmids encoding the α and β1 subunits. Cells were subcultured on glass coverslips for electrophysiological studies 24–48 h after transfection. Currents were recorded from whole cell, inside-out, and outside-out patches. An Axopatch 1D amplifier and CV-4 headstage were used for data acquisition (Axon Instruments; Foster City, CA). Data were acquired in pCLAMP version 5.5.1 (Clampex and Fetchex; Axon). The digitization rate was 4 kHz, and the cut-off frequency for filtration was 1 kHz. Data were analyzed in pCLAMP (version 6; whole cell I-V curves, Clampfit; Axon) and the Analysis of Single Channel Data program (NPo, γ, and histograms; University of Leuven, Belgium). All salts and reagents for solutions were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. Bath solution for whole cell experiments contained (in mM) 135 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 MnCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 glucose, 10 HEPES, 5 Tris; pH 7.4. The pipette solution for whole cell experiments contained (in mM) 120 potassium aspartate, 20 KCl, 5 Mg2+-ATP, 0.1 Na-GTP, 10 BAPTA, 10 HEPES, 5 Tris; pH 7.1. Command voltages were adjusted for a 12 mV junction potential between the bath and pipette. Solutions for excised patch experiments contained (in mM) 140 KCl, 10 HEPES, 5 Tris; pH 7.1. Additionally, 1 mm EGTA or 1 mm HEDTA was added with Ca2+ to achieve pCa values from 5 to 7 (10Bers D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1982; 242: C404-C408Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The effects of ionic strength, pH, and temperature were accounted (Maxchelator 2.05; Pacific Grove, CA). Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. from n cells. Statistical analyses were made with paired and unpaired Student's t test, one- and two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA; with repeated measures as necessary). The threshold for statistical significance was set asp < 0.05 and post-hoc analyses (e.g. Bonferroni test) were applied to indicate differences suggested by ANOVA. Statistical tests were run in Prism (version 3; GraphPad Software, Inc.; San Diego, CA) and Sigma- Stat (version 2; Jandel Scientific Software; San Rafael, CA). Voltage steps from a holding potential of −80 mV elicited two types of voltage-dependent current in canine colonic myocytes studied in the whole cell patch clamp configuration with physiological ion gradients (5 mm K+ outside; 140 mm K+ inside; Fig.1 A). Depolarizations to 0 mV activated delayed rectifier current, while greater depolarizations activated BK current (11Cole W.C. Sanders K.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: C461-C469Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tx (1 μm) produced two effects on voltage-dependent outward currents. First, in the range of potentials from 0 to +40 mV, Tx inhibited the delayed rectifier component of outward current as reported previously (8Dick G.M. Kong I.D. Sanders K.M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 127: 1819-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Second, Tx increased outward current at potentials positive to +40 mV. The outward current activated by Tx was carried by K+, as dialysis of cells with NMDG (N-methyl-d-glucamine) or TEA (tetraethylammonium) instead of K+ prevented the stimulatory effect of Tx. Qualitatively similar effects of Tx were noted when voltage step protocols were used (holding potential −80 mV; Fig. 1, A and B) or when membrane voltage was ramped from −80 to +80 mV (Fig. 1 B, inset). Tx activated K+ current whether cells were studied with the amphotericin-perforated or conventional dialyzed patch technique, suggesting preservation of the intracellular signaling milieu was not necessary. Tx increased current when cells were dialyzed with a pipette solution containing 10 mm BAPTA and no added Ca2+. The calculated free Ca2+ was ∼2 nm (assuming 50 μm Ca2+contamination from water and reagents) and the free BAPTA concentration was greater than 9.5 mm, providing a large buffer against Ca2+ changes. Thus, experiments with BAPTA suggest that the increase in outward current due to Tx was not likely due to changes in Ca2+. Tx-activated current was noisy (Fig. 1 A), suggesting it was due to openings of channels with a large unitary conductance. Tx-activated current was blocked by TEA (1 mm). For example, outward current activated by steps to +80 mV averaged 1.77 ± 0.31 nA and was increased to 4.14 ± 0.51 nA by 1 μm Tx (n = 3; p < 0.05versus control by one-way repeated measures ANOVA). Addition of TEA (1 mm) in the continued presence of Tx reduced outward current to 0.95 ± 0.15 nA (p < 0.05versus both control and Tx). Charybdotoxin (Ctx; 50 nm), a specific peptide inhibitor of BK channels, also inhibited the current activated by Tx. A summary of five experiments testing the effect of Ctx on Tx-activated current is shown in Fig. 1 C. We tested whether the addition of a BK channel blocker abrogated the subsequent effect of 1 μm Tx (n = 3; all comparisons by one-way repeated measures ANOVA). The addition of 1 mm TEA reduced current at +80 mV to 22 ± 9% of control (p < 0.05). Current with the addition of 1 μm Tx, in the continued presence of 1 mm TEA, was 43 ± 8% of control (p < 0.05 versus control, not different from TEA alone). Removal of TEA, in the continued presence of 1 μm Tx, increased current to 211 ± 42% of control (p < 0.05 versus control, TEA alone, and TEA plus Tx). When all drugs were washed out, current at +80 mV returned to within 13 ± 11% of control (not different). The pharmacological profile of the current activated by Tx is consistent with BK channels. Experiments were performed to determine the time course and reversibility of the effects of 1 μm Tx on whole-cell current at +80 mV (Fig. 1 D). Tx increased current 183 ± 40% (n = 6; p < 0.05) in 143 ± 35 s. Current returned to within 19 ± 13% of the control value within 3–5 min of Tx removal (not different from control; all comparisons made by one-way repeated measures ANOVA). Excised patch recordings were performed to identify the conductance activated by Tx. In inside-out or outside-out patches from canine colonic myocytes, large conductance (>200 pS), Ca2+- and voltage-dependent channel openings were observed (12Carl A. Sanders K.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: C470-C480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The channels were highly selective for K+ over Na+. In outside-out patches, submillimolar concentrations of TEA caused a flicker block of these channels. These are properties of BK channels, which have been identified and characterized previously in canine colonic myocytes (12Carl A. Sanders K.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: C470-C480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tx (1 μm) increased NPo of BK channels in excised patches (Fig.2). Additionally, Tx decreased γ. For example, in the records of Fig. 2, γ was 269 pS and was reduced to 243 pS by 1 μm Tx. Similar to the results in whole cell patches with TEA and Ctx (Fig. 1), the single channels activated by Tx were blocked by Ctx (50 nm; Fig.3 A). To determine this, outside-out patches were studied. Tx had the same effect in outside-out patches as it did in inside-out patches (and in cell-attached patches; not shown). As can be seen in the all-points amplitude histogram from 1 min recordings from an outside-out patch, Tx increased NPoand decreased the γ of BK channels (Fig. 3 B). In the control record, the Gaussian mean for the single channel openings at +40 mV was centered at 10.4 pA. In contrast, the unitary currents in the presence of Tx were centered at 8.9 pA.Figure 3Tx activates charybdotoxin-sensitive channels in canine colon smooth muscle. A, representative single channel experiment in an outside-out patch (100 nm free Ca2+). Patch potential was +40 mV. Currents were measured before and after the addition of 1 μm Tx, which increased NPo. Ctx (50 nm) blocked channel openings in the continued presence of Tx. B, all-points amplitude histograms from 60 s of recording demonstrate the effect of Tx and Ctx. A single open level was observed under control conditions. Tx (1 μm) increased NPo, revealing two more open levels, and decreased γ. The decrease in γ resembles a flicker block, as there was a broadening of the Gaussian peaks and the shoulders between them. Ctx (50 nm) inhibited channel openings in the continuous presence of 1 μm Tx.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Single channel currents were recorded for long durations to accurately assess the effect of Tx on NPo. As the recording in Fig.4 A shows, NPo was stable after patch excision and Tx and 17βE increased it in a reversible manner. Me2SO, the vehicle used for Tx and 17βE, had no effect on NPo (Fig. 4 B). Tx increased BK NPo in a concentration-dependent manner (0.1–10 μm) with an EC50 of 0.65 μm (Fig. 5 A;n = 15–22). NPo was allowed to reach a steady-state value for ∼5 min before the addition of Tx. Current was then recorded for 1–10 min under control conditions, and then Tx was added. NPo was measured in the presence of Tx for 1–10 min and the mean change was calculated. These data demonstrate that Tx increases BK channel NPo; in vivo, however, most Tx is bound to plasma proteins. Thus, it is uncertain whether the presence of albumin (the major Tx-binding protein), for example, would alter the efficacy and potency of Tx in these in vitromeasurements. We performed experiments to determine the Tx concentration-NPo response relationship in the presence of 20 mg/ml albumin. The effects of Tx were still apparent in the presence of protein; however, albumin decreased the efficacy of Tx ∼60% and caused a slight right shift in the EC50 (2.0 μm; Fig. 5 A).Figure 5Tx and 17βE increase BK NPo and decrease γ. A, concentration-response curve for the effect of Tx on NPo (n = 15–22). The lower curve is in the presence of 20 mg/ml albumin, a protein to which Tx is bound in vivo. Albumin decreased the efficacy of Tx (n = 6). B, Tx was more potent than 17βE in the same patches (n = 10). The effect of 17βE was measured after 10 min, then 1 μm Tx was added. Data were compared by one-way repeated measures ANOVA; asterisks indicate a difference from control, cross indicates a difference between Tx and 17βE. C, Tx decreases γ. Currents were measured from inside-out patches with 5 mm K+in the pipette and 140 mm K+ in the bath before and after the addition of 1 μm Tx. I-V curves were compared by two-way repeated measures ANOVA; asterisksindicate a difference from control (n = 6).D, Tx and 17βE decrease γ at +80 mV. Statistical analyses and symbols are the same as for C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The effect of Tx on increasing BK NPo was similar to the effect of 17βE described previously (2Valverde M.A. Rojas P. Amigo J. Cosmelli D. Orio P. Bahamonde M.I. Mann G.E. Vergara C. Latorre R. Science. 1999; 285: 1929-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). In our experiments, however, Tx was approximately 4-fold more potent than the previously reported EC50 of 2.6 μm for 17βE (2Valverde M.A. Rojas P. Amigo J. Cosmelli D. Orio P. Bahamonde M.I. Mann G.E. Vergara C. Latorre R. Science. 1999; 285: 1929-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). These pharmacological concentrations of 17βE are substantially higher than the 100–600 pm physiological concentration range (13Thorneycroft I.H. Mishell D.R. Stone S.C. Kharma K.M. Nakamura R.M. Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 1971; 111: 947-951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), but the EC50 for Tx was well within the therapeutic plasma concentration range measured in plasma of human cancer patients (0.1–10 μm; Refs. 14Bergan R.C.

To compare the potency of 17βE and Tx to increase NPo of BK channels, we tested the two agents in the same excised patches (Fig. 5 B). 17βE (10 μm) was applied first and NPo was allowed to reach a steady state. 17βE was then washed out, and 1 μm Tx was added, which increased NPo to a higher level. These studies indicated that Tx is at least one log order more potent than 17βE, as Tx had a greater potentiating effect than a 10-fold higher concentration of 17βE. We also compared the reduction in γ caused by Tx to 17βE. I-V curves for BK channels in inside-out patches (asymmetrical K+ gradient; 5 mm pipette; 140 mmbath) are shown in Fig. 5 C. Conductance at +80 mV was calculated to be 247 ± 3 pS (n = 6) under control conditions, and γ was reduced to 204 ± 4 pS in the presence of 1 μm Tx (18 ± 2% decrease). A similar, but less potent, effect was observed with 17βE (Fig. 5 D). In these experiments, BK channel γ averaged 261 ± 5 pS at +80 mV under control conditions (inside-out patches, symmetrical 140 mm K+; n = 10), and γ was reduced to 243 ± 6 pS by 10 μm 17βE (8 ± 1% decrease; p < 0.05). 17βE was washed out, then Tx was added. Tx (1 μm) further reduced γ to 207 ± 4 pS (21 ± 6% decrease; p < 0.05). Tx shifted the voltage dependence of steady-state activation to more negative potentials. Inside-out patches were studied in symmetrical 140 mm K+ and varying Ca2+concentrations. The patch potential was held at 0 mV and stepped to different potentials to determine steady-state activation before and after the addition of 1 μm Tx. The patch potential was made more positive until conductance was maximal and then activation curves (i.e. normalized conductance versusvoltage) were generated. Tx (1 μm) decreased current (Fig. 6 A) and shifted the voltage of half-activation (V 12 ) to more negative values at the same free Ca2+ concentration (Fig. 6 B). Tx had no effect on BK channel activation kinetics. The time constant of activation at +150 mV in 100 nm free Ca2+ was 23 ± 2 and 24 ± 3 ms before and after the addition of 1 μm Tx, respectively (n = 18). Experiments were performed in Ca2+ concentrations ranging from pCa 7 to 3. Increasing the free Ca2+concentration made V 12 more negative; however, Tx (1 μm) caused the same hyperpolarizing shift in V 12 independent of the free Ca2+ concentration (Fig. 6 C). The effect of Tx to increase BK NPo was not limited to canine colonic smooth muscle. We tested the effect of Tx on BK channels in 4 additional smooth muscle cell types from both visceral and vascular tissues. All of the same effects of Tx observed in canine colonic myocytes were noted in smooth muscle cells from the human jejunum, mouse colon, mouse aorta, and canine mesenteric vein. Tx increased BK current in whole cell recordings; however, delayed rectifier current was inhibited, as in canine colon (Fig.7 A). Tx increased the NPo of BK channels in excised patches in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 7 B) and γ was decreased (Fig. 7 C).

Tx had no effect on the NPo of single channels in cells expressingSlo α, but Tx did reduce γ (233 ± 11 pS;p < 0.05, paired Student's t test; 12 ± 4% reduction; Fig. 8 A). Expression of Slo α and β1 subunits together produced channels with an average γ of 266 ± 8 pS (n = 9). This conductance was not significantly different from the γ of channels in cells transfected with α subunits alone (p > 0.05; unpaired Student's t test). Tx increased NPo of channels in cells expressing both α and β1 subunits (Fig. 8 B) and decreased γ (230 ± 9 pS,p < 0.05, paired Student's t test; 13 ± 2% reduction). These data suggest that the Tx-induced increase in NPo requires the presence of the regulatory β1 subunit, however the attenuation of γ does not. Tx, a commonly used chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment and prevention of estrogen receptor-dependent cancers, increased NPo of BK channels. Activation of BK channels by Tx was observed in tonic and phasic smooth muscle myocytes from mice, dogs, and humans, and it may be a common phenomenon for cells that express the regulatory β1 subunit (as do the tissues used here, Ref.9Vogalis F. Vincent T. Qureshi I. Schmalz F. Ward M.W. Sanders K.M. Horowitz B. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: G629-G639PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of Tx to increase BK NPo required the presence of the regulatory β1 subunit, but the exact site of action is unknown. In the absence of the regulatory β1 subunit, Tx decreased γ without affecting NPo. The activating effect of Tx is similar to that reported for 17βE on BK channels containing the β1 subunit (2Valverde M.A. Rojas P. Amigo J. Cosmelli D. Orio P. Bahamonde M.I. Mann G.E. Vergara C. Latorre R. Science. 1999; 285: 1929-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar) and novel β subunits (19Behrens R. Nolting A. Reimann F. Schwarz M. Waldschutz R. Pongs O. FEBS Lett. 2000; 474: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). However, Tx was at least 10 times more potent than 17βE. Further, the EC50 for Tx (0.65 μm) falls within the plasma concentration range measured during chemotherapy (0.1–10 μm; Ref. 14Bergan R.C. Reed E. Myers C.E. Headlee D. Brawley O. Cho H.K. Figg W.D. Tompkins A. Linehan W.M. Kohler D. Steinberg S.M. Blagosklonny M.V. Clin. Cancer Res. 1999; 5: 2366-2373PubMed Google Scholar). This contrasts with the peak plasma concentrations of 17βE (<1 nm; Ref. 13Thorneycroft I.H. Mishell D.R. Stone S.C. Kharma K.M. Nakamura R.M. Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 1971; 111: 947-951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar)) and the reported EC50 (2.6 μm) for 17βE effects on BK channels (2Valverde M.A. Rojas P. Amigo J. Cosmelli D. Orio P. Bahamonde M.I. Mann G.E. Vergara C. Latorre R. Science. 1999; 285: 1929-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Both Tx and 17βE decreased the γ of BK channels, a novel effect seen in addition to changes in NPo. Effects of Tx on BK channel NPo were observable at concentrations as low as 0.1 μm, apparent in the presence of 20 mg/ml albumin (a Tx-binding protein), and the effects were rapid and reversible. The speed and reversibility of the Tx effects on BK channels suggest they are due to a non-genomic mechanism at the plasma membrane (20Wehling M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 365-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar) (e.g. it has been proposed that there is an extracellular binding site on the regulatory β1 subunit; Ref. 2Valverde M.A. Rojas P. Amigo J. Cosmelli D. Orio P. Bahamonde M.I. Mann G.E. Vergara C. Latorre R. Science. 1999; 285: 1929-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). It is unknown whether Tx or 17βE binds directly to β1 subunits or to an accessory protein, the influence of which is conveyed to BK channels via the β1 subunit. However, the similarities between the effect of Tx and 17βE on BK NPo suggest both agonists may affect the channels via the same binding site, the location of which has not been determined conclusively. The data of Valverde et al. (2Valverde M.A. Rojas P. Amigo J. Cosmelli D. Orio P. Bahamonde M.I. Mann G.E. Vergara C. Latorre R. Science. 1999; 285: 1929-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar) indicate that 17βE activates BK channels in inside-out patches independent of cellular signaling mechanisms. Our data confirm and further show that Tx has a similar ability to activate BK channels in inside-out patches. Tx and 17βE are very lipophilic and cross membranes readily. The intended therapeutic action of Tx is to cross the cell membrane and antagonize the nuclear estrogen receptor. This explains why the same effects on BK NPo and conductance were observed in whole cell, cell-attached, outside-out, and inside-out patches. However, Tx (and 17βE) also acts non-genomically in patches of excised membrane. The actual site of action could be at the extracellular surface, at the cytoplasmic face, or within the plasma membrane itself. The exact site is presently unknown and might be resolved in the future by using site-directed mutagenesis. What can be determined from the work of Valverde et al. (2Valverde M.A. Rojas P. Amigo J. Cosmelli D. Orio P. Bahamonde M.I. Mann G.E. Vergara C. Latorre R. Science. 1999; 285: 1929-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar) is that a membrane-impermeant form of 17βE conjugated to albumin elicits effects only when applied to the extracellular side of the membrane. The lack of effect from the cytoplasmic face for albumin-conjugated 17βE may be due to some steric hindrance and not indicative of a known position for the putative binding site. Regardless, the β1 subunit is an integral, requisite part of the signaling mechanism. Further, the effects of Tx and 17βE are likely direct and do not involve other signaling mechanisms such as nitric oxide production or phosphorylation (well recognized mechanisms that affect BK NPo), as the effects are observed in cell-free patches in the absence of appropriate substrates for those signal transduction cascades. Additional strength for a direct effect of Tx and 17βE is that they have no effect on the NPo of the α subunit alone, which possesses a stimulatory protein kinase G phosphorylation site (18Fukao M. Mason H.S. Kenyon J.L. Horowitz B. Keef K.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 16-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Tx also affects other ion channels. Tx inhibits volume-sensitive Cl− and delayed rectifier K+ currents in canine colonic smooth muscle (8Dick G.M. Kong I.D. Sanders K.M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 127: 1819-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Tx also inhibits voltage-gated Na+ (21Hardy S.P. deFelipe C. Valverde M.A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 434: 236-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), L-type Ca2+ (8Dick G.M. Kong I.D. Sanders K.M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 127: 1819-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 22Doughty J.M. Miller A.L. Langton P.D. J. Physiol. 1998; 507 (2): 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and nonselective cation channels (23Allen M.C. Newland C. Valverde M.A. Hardy S.P. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 354: 261-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 24Welsh D.G. Nelson M.T. Eckman D.M. Brayden J.E. J. Physiol. 2000; 527 Pt 1: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Tx inhibits protein kinase C (25O'Brian C.A. Liskamp R.M. Solomon D.H. Weinstein I.B. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 2462-2465PubMed Google Scholar) and calmodulin (26Lam H.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 118: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) and antagonizes histamine receptors (27Kroeger E.A. Brandes L.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 131: 750-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Thus, the effects of Tx in vitro or in vivo are likely to be multifaceted and are difficult to identify specifically. However, none of these other actions explain the effects of Tx to increase BK channel NPo. Tx has a number of effects on smooth muscle tissues. Tx relaxes myometrial arteries and increases uterine blood flow (28Marshall K. Senior J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1987; 92: 429-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Tx inhibits spontaneous and agonist-induced myometrial contractions (29Kostrzewska A. Laudanski T. Batra S. Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 1997; 176: 381-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and hyperpolarizes and relaxes cerebral arteries (30Nelson M.T. Conway M.A. Knot H.J. Brayden J.E. J. Physiol (Lond). 1997; 502: 259-264Crossref Scopus (178) Google Scholar). These effects are consistent with the action of Tx on BK channels. High extracellular K+, which limits the degree to which openings of BK channels can hyperpolarize smooth muscle, abrogates the relaxing effect of Tx on myometrium (29Kostrzewska A. Laudanski T. Batra S. Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 1997; 176: 381-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). BK channels comprise one element of a negative feedback loop controlling the tone of cerebral arteries. Specifically, release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and subsequent activation of BK channels relaxes cerebral arteries (31Nelson M.T. Cheng H. Rubart M. Santana L.F. Bonev A.D. Knot H.J. Lederer W.J. Science. 1995; 270: 633-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar). It is likely that the hyperpolarization of cerebral arteries (30Nelson M.T. Conway M.A. Knot H.J. Brayden J.E. J. Physiol (Lond). 1997; 502: 259-264Crossref Scopus (178) Google Scholar) and relaxation of myometrium and myometrial arteries (28Marshall K. Senior J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1987; 92: 429-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 29Kostrzewska A. Laudanski T. Batra S. Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 1997; 176: 381-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) by Tx is due, in part, to the activation of BK channels. BK channel activation would drive membrane potential toward EK, reducing the Po of L-type Ca2+channels independent of (and in addition to) possible direct inhibitory effects on voltage-gated Ca2+ entry. It is possible that Ctx might antagonize Tx-induced relaxation and hyperpolarization reported previously (28Marshall K. Senior J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1987; 92: 429-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 29Kostrzewska A. Laudanski T. Batra S. Am. J. Obstet.

Physiol (Lond). 1997; 502: 259-264Crossref Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The effects of Tx on ion channels may be responsible for some therapeutic side effects. While Tx chemotherapy is generally well tolerated, side effects include vasomotor (facial flushing; Ref. 32Love R.R. Cameron L. Connell B.L. Leventhal H. Arch. Intern. Med. 1991; 151: 1842-1847Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), cardiac (Q-T interval prolongation; Ref. 17Trump D.L. Smith D.C. Ellis P.G. Rogers M.P. Schold S.C. Winer E.P. Panella T.J.

It is likely that the effect of Tx on ion channels (e.g. BK) plays at least some role in producing these effects. However, our findings also suggest that novel pharmacological targeting of the β1 subunit with xenoestrogens may be useful for treatment of diseases that have a smooth muscle component, such as hypertension, myocardial ischemia, asthma, impotence, and constipation. These findings give insight into BK channel structure and function, signaling roles, and pharmacological properties of the β1 subunit, the non-genomic regulation of BK channels by estrogen and xenoestrogens, as well as Tx-induced side effects.

One of these pathways entails growth factor receptor transactivation followed by ERK activation. This study demonstrates that a similar signaling pathway is used by the μ-opioid receptor (MOR) expressed in HEK293 cells and involves calmodulin (CaM). Stimulation of MOR resulted in both epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and ERK phosphorylation. Data obtained with inhibitors of EGFR Tyr kinase and membrane metalloproteases support an intermediate role of EGFR activation, involving release of endogenous membrane-bound epidermal growth factor. Previous studies had demonstrated a role for CaM in opioid signaling based on direct CaM binding to MOR. To test whether CaM contributes to EGFR transactivation and ERK phosphorylation by MOR, we compared wild-type MOR with mutant K273A MOR, which binds CaM poorly, but couples normally to G proteins. Stimulation of K273A MOR with [d-Ala2,MePhe4,Gly-ol5]enkephalin (10–100 nm) resulted in significantly reduced ERK phosphorylation. Furthermore, wild-type MOR stimulated EGFR Tyr phosphorylation 3-fold more than K273A MOR, indicating that direct CaM-MOR interaction plays a key role in the transactivation process. Inhibitors of CaM and protein kinase C also attenuated [d-Ala2,MePhe4,Gly-ol5]enkephalin-induced EGFR transactivation in wild-type (but not mutant) MOR-expressing cells. This novel pathway of EGFR transactivation may be shared by other G protein-coupled receptors shown to interact with CaM.

Multiple interactions of CaM with proteins involved in signal transduction by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) indicate that it plays an extensive role in signaling (4–15). However, evidence for direct binding of CaM to GPCRs has emerged only recently. A CaM-binding site has been located on the C-terminal region of subtypes 5 and 7 of the metabotropic glutamate receptors and the third intracellular loop of the dopamine D2 receptors MOR and DOR (8Minakami R.

The ERK phosphorylation cascade ranks among the main signaling pathways involved in mitogenic responses to external stimuli. This cascade entails receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling pathways as well as a highly interconnected network of multiple signals including input from GPCRs (16Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3523) Google Scholar). Diverse mechanisms are involved in these heterologous signaling pathways. The GPCR signaling pathways to RTK-ERK activation include adaptor proteins such as Grb2 and Shc; the GTP/GDP exchange factor SOS; and the low molecular weight G protein Ras, which complexes with Raf, a MEK kinase in many cell types. The GPCR-mediated activation of the ERK phosphorylation cascade can be initiated by release of either heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein Gi/o βγ-subunits or Gq α-subunits and often involves PKC along with non-receptor tyrosine kinases such as PYK2 and Src (17Crespo P.

It remains to be clarified whether CaM affects GPCR-mediated ERK phosphorylation only at points downstream of RTKs, at steps involved in transactivation of RTKs, or within a GPCR pathway that bypasses RTKs. This question is addressed here with MOR. Interactions between opioid receptors and Ca2+/CaM occur in some signaling pathways. Morphine and enkephalin were shown to regulate cellular redistribution of CaM in brain and in NG108-15 cell cultures (47Hanbauer I. Gimble J. Sankaran K. Sherard R. Neuropharmacology. 1979; 18: 859-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 48Nehmad R. Nadler H. Simantov R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1982; 22: 389-394PubMed Google Scholar). In NG108-15 cells, DOR stimulates cAMP phosphodiesterase activity via a Ca2+/CaM-dependent enzyme (49Law P.Y. Loh H.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 684-693PubMed Google Scholar). CaM kinase II, a serine/threonine-dependent protein kinase, can desensitize opioid receptors (50Mestek A. Hurley J.H. Bye L.S. Campbell A.D. Chen Y. Tian M. Liu J. Schulman H. Yu L. J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 22081-22088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) discovered that by binding to the third intracellular loop of MOR and DOR, Ca2+/CaM interferes with G protein coupling. Agonist binding to the receptor precipitates the release of CaM from the plasma membrane and its translocation to the nucleus (54Wang D. Tolbert L.M. Carlson K.W. Sadee W. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1418-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Upon agonist stimulation of a mutant MOR (K273A MOR) that binds CaM poorly, CaM is not released from the plasma membrane into the cytosol, whereas the wild-type and mutant MORs stimulate free cytosolic Ca2+ to a similar extent (10Wang D. Sadée W. Quillan J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22081-22088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Thus, a novel signaling pathway for opioid receptors has been proposed involving CaM as a possible second messenger. Here we present evidence for the presence of a major CaM-dependent and a minor CaM-independent MOR-mediated ERK signaling pathway that involve transactivation of EGFR as an intermediate step. EGFR transactivation by MOR appears to involve direct CaM-MOR interactions. Chemicals were purchased from Sigma with the following exceptions.

HEK293 cells were grown at 37 °C in a humidified CO2 (5%) incubator in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's nutrient mixture F-12 containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Stably transfected HEK293 cells expressing either the empty vector (pcDNA3) or plasmids containing N-terminal FLAG-tagged human wild-type or mutant K273A MOR or rat MOR were maintained in medium containing 200 μg/ml G418 as described (10Wang D.

Cells were routinely seeded in six-well plates for at least 48 h prior to maintenance in serum-free medium for 24 h. For ERK experiments, serum-free medium was changed in all wells at the time of pretreatment with inhibitor. HEK293 cells expressing MOR or MOR mutants were collected and spun at 3000 × g for 5 min, and the cell pellets were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. After repeating the centrifugation, cells were suspended in ice-cold 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and immediately used in binding assays. Cells (0.3–3 × 105 cells/200 μl) were incubated with saturating concentrations (3–10 nm) of [3H]diprenorphine at 20 °C for 1 h in a final volume of 250 μl. Nonspecific binding was measured in the presence of 10 μm diprenorphine. Both tritiated and unlabeled ligands were diluted in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 1% bovine serum albumin. Reactions were terminated by adding 5 ml of ice-cold buffer, followed by rapid filtration over GF/B filters using a Brandel cell harvester. Filters were washed twice with ice-cold 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and then counted. Proteins were extracted from cells with NaOH, and their levels were determined. Data were analyzed with the Newman-Keuls multiple comparison test using GraphPAD Prism software. ERK activity was measured by immunoblotting as described (26Bohn L.M. Belcheva M.M. Coscia C.J. J.

Briefly, cultures were pretreated with different inhibitors, followed by DAMGO or EGF addition as described in the figure legends. Cells were then washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, 10 mm EGTA, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm sodium vanadate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20 μg/ml each aprotinin and leupeptin. Lysates were spun at 14,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the protein concentration of the supernatants was determined. Cell lysates (20–30 μg of protein/lane) were separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were blotted on Immobilon PTMpolyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Nonspecific sites were blocked with 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline and 0.2% Tween 20 (TBST). Blots were then washed three times with TBST and incubated with anti-phospho-ERK antibody, diluted 1:2000 in TBST for at least 15 h at 4 °C. After three washes with TBST, blots were incubated with 1:2000 diluted horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature. Bands were visualized using an ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and exposure to Classic Blue sensitive x-ray film (Molecular Technologies, St. Louis, MO). For assurance of equivalent total ERK protein/lane, representative blots were stripped (0.2 mglycine (pH 2.5), 60 min at room temperature) and exposed to antibodies for ERK1, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. Band intensities were determined by densitometric analysis using an Eastman Kodak DC120 digital camera (1.2 megapixels), Kodak ds 1D Version 3.0.2 software (Scientific Imaging Systems, New Haven, CT), and Image software for Windows, a modification of NIH Image Version 1.62 (Scion Corp., Frederick, MD). Cells were serum-starved for 24 h and treated with DAMGO (0.1 μm, 10 min) or EGF (0.1 μg/ml, 5 min). In some experiments, cells were pretreated with tyrphostin AG 1478 (0.1 μm) and then exposed to DAMGO (0.1 μm, 10 min). Cultures were lysed using a modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; 1 μg/ml each leupeptin and aprotinin, 1 mmNa3VO4, and 1 mm NaF. Cell lysates of 0.8–1.5 mg of protein (diluted to ∼1 μg/μl) were used. EGFR was immunoprecipitated by adding 5–10 μg of either mouse monoclonal or sheep polyclonal anti-EGFR antibody to the lysates and incubating overnight at 4 °C. This step was followed by addition of a 50-μl suspension of protein G Plus A-Agarose beads per sample and incubation for 3–4 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in SDS loading buffer, and boiled for 5 min before SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were blotted on Immobilon PTM polyvinylidene difluoride membranes with a 1:200 or 1:400 dilution of anti-phospho-EGFR antibody (active form) and then 1:2000 diluted horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. As described above, bands were visualized using the ECL detection system. [35S]GTPγS assays were conducted on membranes prepared from HEK293 cells as described (10Wang D. Sadée W. Quillan J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22081-22088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Cell membranes (10 μg) were incubated with different concentrations of morphine in assay buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, 100 mmNaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 nm[35S]GTPγS, and 1 μm GDP at 35 °C for 5 min. Reactions were stopped by centrifugation, and radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. cAMP measurements were performed by radioimmunoassay in suspensions of HEK293 cells as described (56Arden J.R. Segredo V. Wang Z. Lameh J. Sadee W. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1636-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (57Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215632) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml) as the standard. Statistical determinations were made by Student's t test analysis using GraphPAD Prism software. Cells were treated with DAMGO for the times indicated in Fig. 1 A and then collected, lysed, and assayed for ERK phosphorylation by immunoblotting. Wild-type MOR showed a time course of ERK phosphorylation by DAMGO with a maximum between 5 and 10 min. Mutant K273A MOR gave a similar time course (data not shown). To compare wild-type and mutant MOR-mediated ERK phosphorylation at different DAMGO concentrations, experiments on the two cell lines were run on the same gel (Fig. 1 B). At all concentrations tested, DAMGO-induced ERK phosphorylation was greater in wild-type than in mutant K273A MOR-transfected cells (Fig.1 C). At nanomolar levels of DAMGO, the CaM-insensitive mutant MOR stimulated less ERK phosphorylation, whereas at micromolar levels, differences between the wild-type and mutant MORs were attenuated. Since differences in efficacy between the wild-type and mutant MORs may be due to the presence of different levels of expressed MOR, we determined binding parameters for both receptors. Binding data generated using wild-type and mutant MOR-expressing cells and the antagonist [3H]diprenorphine suggested the presence of similar levels of expressed MOR in wild-type (1.24 ± 0.28 pmol/mg of protein) and mutant K273A (1.57 ± 0.19 pmol/mg of protein) cell lines. This finding confirmed previous binding studies performed with the same cells by Wang et al. (10Wang D. Sadée W. Quillan J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22081-22088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). [35S]GTPγS experiments were performed on both wild-type and mutant K273A MOR-transfected cells and compared. The mutant receptor proved to be just as efficient as the wild-type receptor, if not better, in mediating both [35S]GTPγS binding activity (Fig. 2 A) and inhibition of forskolin-induced cAMP production (TableI). Thus, the mutation adversely affects neither G protein coupling nor cAMP modulation of MOR, consistent with earlier results (10Wang D. Sadée W. Quillan J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22081-22088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar).Table IInhibition of forskolin-induced cAMP production by morphineHEK293 cell typehMORK273ArMORrMOR/ACaMIC50(nm)1.62 ± 0.152.1 ± 0.093.45 ± 0.114.2 ± 0.07Imax (%)68.1 ± 2.382 ± 374.8 ± 8.897 ± 3.5HEK293 cell suspensions were incubated with 10 μmforskolin for 10 min at 37 °C in the presence of different concentrations of morphine (10−9 to 10−5m).

Open table in a new tab HEK293 cell suspensions were incubated with 10 μmforskolin for 10 min at 37 °C in the presence of different concentrations of morphine (10−9 to 10−5m). Cells were harvested and lysed, and cAMP levels were measured. hMOR, human MOR; rMOR, rat MOR; ACaM, CaM-antisense. Since CaM binds to MOR and appears to influence ERK signaling, we conducted [35S]GTPγS binding, cAMP production, and ERK phosphorylation experiments with HEK293 cells expressing CaM-antisense and rat MOR. The expression of MOR and the reduced levels of CaM in these cells have been previously characterized (10Wang D. Sadée W. Quillan J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22081-22088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Cells cotransfected with CaM-antisense and rat MOR displayed greater activity in both [35S]GTPγS binding and cAMP assays than those overexpressing rat MOR alone (Fig. 2 B and Table I). In contrast, the presence of CaM-antisense significantly reduced (but did not abolish) MOR-mediated ERK phosphorylation (Fig.3). Assuming the involvement of growth factor signaling intermediates, one might ask whether there are CaM-dependent steps in the RTK segment of this heterologous pathway. To answer this question, we determined whether CaM-antisense blocks EGF-stimulated ERK phosphorylation in the rat MOR- and CaM-antisense-cotransfected cell lines. CaM-antisense attenuated ERK phosphorylation stimulated by EGF. The inhibitory effect was less than that of CaM-antisense on DAMGO-elicited ERK (Fig. 3). Thus, reduced levels of CaM accompany the attenuation of ERK phosphorylation in both the GPCR and RTK pathways. Since PKC, like CaM, is an important Ca2+-binding protein that has been implicated in GPCR activation of MAPKs, its possible involvement in this MOR signaling pathway was tested. GFX, a relatively selective inhibitor of PKC, was added to the media of wild-type and mutant MOR-transfected cells prior to DAMGO exposure. Although GFX alone did not affect basal levels, it inhibited DAMGO-induced phosphorylation of ERK in the wild-type MOR-transfected cells (Fig. 4). In contrast to wild-type MOR, GFX did not reduce mutant MOR signaling. To determine whether MOR-mediated activation of ERK requires EGFR transactivation, we treated cells with the EGFR Tyr kinase inhibitor tyrphostin AG 1478, followed by DAMGO, and measured ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 5). Again, DAMGO was less effective in stimulating ERK activation via the mutant compared with wild-type MOR. Tyrphostin AG 1478 alone attenuated basal levels of ERK phosphorylation by 50% (n = 4–7;p < 0.05), suggesting the existence of tonic autocrine RTK activation. Similarly, tyrphostin AG 1478 reduced DAMGO-stimulated ERK phosphorylation in both wild-type and mutant MOR-expressing cells, suggesting that an EGFR transactivation mechanism may be involved in both cases. As discussed in the Introduction, metalloproteases are involved in the shedding of some endogenously expressed growth factor-like ligands from their plasma membrane anchor. The use of metalloprotease inhibitors could provide additional information on the involvement of growth factor receptor activation by endogenously released ligands. Therefore, wild-type and mutant K273A MOR-transfected HEK293 cells were pretreated with eithero-phenanthroline or phosphoramidon for 1 h before exposure to DAMGO. Both inhibitors when used alone diminished basal levels of ERK phosphorylation by 40–60% (n = 3–6;p < 0.05), consistent with the existence of tonic autocrine RTK activation as seen with tyrphostin. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 6, o-phenanthroline or phosphoramidon affected DAMGO stimulation of ERK phosphorylation in the wild-type line, but not in the mutant line. These data support the hypothesis that wild-type MOR signals to ERK via at least two EGFR transactivation mechanisms. A major EGFR-dependent pathway to ERK appears to involve CaM-MOR interactions and membrane metalloproteases. To further support the hypothesis that DAMGO-induced MOR-stimulated ERK occurs via a mechanism involving transactivation of EGFR, we determined whether the μ-agonist induces phosphorylation of the growth factor receptor. For this purpose, wild-type and mutant K273A MOR-transfected HEK293 cells were exposed to DAMGO or EGF, and EGFR was immunoprecipitated. Immunoblotting performed with anti-phospho-EGFR antibody revealed that DAMGO stimulated a 4-fold increase in EGFR phosphorylation in wild-type MOR cell lines compared with control cells (Fig.7 A). If cells were pretreated with tyrphostin AG 1478 before exposure to DAMGO, the EGFR phosphorylation by DAMGO was diminished. DAMGO-induced EGFR phosphorylation was only 30% in cells expressing the CaM binding-deficient mutant MOR in comparison with the wild-type MOR (Fig.7 A). The data are in good agreement with the differential rates of DAMGO-induced ERK phosphorylation by wild-type and mutant MORs (Fig. 1, B and C). Since CaM binding to MOR appears to regulate its signaling to ERK, it is important to determine whether there is a CaM-dependent step preceding EGFR transactivation. To this end, wild-type and mutant MOR-transfected cells were preincubated with the CaM inhibitor W-7, and DAMGO-induced EGFR phosphorylation was measured. W-7 significantly attenuated EGFR phosphorylation by DAMGO in wild-type MOR-transfected cells, but failed to do so in mutant cells (Fig. 7 B). Similarly, the PKC inhibitor GFX also attenuated MOR-mediated EGFR phosphorylation in wild-type MOR-transfected cells, but not in mutant cells. These findings support the notion of a CaM- and PKC-dependent step in the MOR signaling pathway leading to EGFR transactivation in HEK293 cells. To obtain additional evidence for the CaM dependence of DAMGO-induced EGFR phosphorylation and to determine the combined effect of low CaM levels and the presence of the metalloprotease inhibitor in the process, experiments were also performed with HEK293 cells expressing rat MOR cotransfected with the CaM-antisense construct. Pretreatment of cells with o-phenanthroline reduced DAMGO-induced EGFR phosphorylation in the wild-type rat MOR line, but not in cells cotransfected with CaM-antisense (Fig. 7 C). The data support our previous evidence for CaM-dependent MOR transactivation of EGFR. The data presented here provide evidence that direct CaM interactions with MOR play a role in opioid modulation of ERK activation in HEK293 cells. The MOR-mediated pathway proceeds via a CaM- and PKC-sensitive transactivation of EGFR and appears to involve the activation of metalloproteases and release of endogenous EGF-like factors (Fig. 8). This novel signaling pathway is supported by the following findings of this study. 1) DAMGO-induced ERK phosphorylation was greater in wild-type than in mutant K273A MOR-transfected cells. 2) CaM-antisense inhibited DAMGO-induced ERK phosphorylation. 3) Inhibition by tyrphostin AG 1478,o-phenanthroline, and phosphoramidon implicated EGFR transactivation in MOR signaling to ERK. 4) More definitive evidence for MOR-mediated EGFR transactivation was gained by demonstrating that DAMGO induced tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR. Why does mutant MOR display less DAMGO-induced ERK phosphorylation than the wild-type receptor even though it couples to GTPγS, inhibits cAMP production, and activates cytosolic free Ca2+ to a comparable extent? Wang et al. (10Wang D. Sadée W. Quillan J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22081-22088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 54Wang D. Tolbert L.M. Carlson K.W. Sadee W. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1418-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) found that CaM binds to MOR and that, upon agonist activation, wild-type MOR releases CaM into the cytosol, where it can interact with other target proteins or undergo further trafficking to the nucleus. It has been shown that morphine treatment of striatum causes ≥50% increases in cytosolic and intracellular membrane CaM content (47Hanbauer I. Gimble J. Sankaran K. Sherard R. Neuropharmacology. 1979; 18: 859-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 48Nehmad R. Nadler H. Simantov R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1982; 22: 389-394PubMed Google Scholar). Since CaM translocation does not occur in mutant MOR-expressing lines, less CaM may become available in the cytosol and other cellular compartments. As discussed in the Introduction, the Ras-Raf complex may well be one of the sites of CaM stimulation of ERK phosphorylation in the EGF pathway to ERK in HEK293 cells. If the released cytosolic CaM is needed to optimally activate this Ca2+/CaM-dependent opioid signaling step, a decrease in ERK phosphorylation may ensue for mutant MOR. The inhibition of ERK phosphorylation in CaM-antisense-expressing cells is in accordance with this hypothesis. Together with previous results implicating membrane-bound metalloproteases, the data reported here indicate that MOR stimulation leads mainly to transactivation of EGFR and only secondarily to ERK activation. CaM inhibitors have been shown to promote shedding of membrane-bound growth factors via matrix metalloproteases (58Dı́az-Rodrı́guez E. Esparı́s-Ogando A. Montero J.C. Yusta L. Pandiella A. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 59Dong J. Wiley H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 557-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). CaM antagonists were found to stimulate the cleavage of several membrane proteins, including EGFR-binding ligands in Chinese hamster ovary and human epithelial cells, and this process was PKC-independent. In addition, Bosch et al. (60Bosch M. Gil J. Bachs O. Agell N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22145-22150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) reported that the CaM inhibitor W-13 alone induced an increase in Ras, Raf, and ERK activation in cultured NIH3T3 and normal rat kidney cells. The stimulation of ERK by W-13 alone may be explained by its induction of the release of endogenous plasma membrane-bound EGFR-binding ligands, leading to the activation of this receptor and subsequent activation of Ras-Raf. In accordance with these previous results, the CaM inhibitor W-7 attenuated DAMGO stimulation of EGFR phosphorylation in the wild-type MOR cells. However, in K273A MOR cells, the major CaM-dependent pathway was not operative; and therefore, W-7 had no effect. Therefore, a minor pathway of ERK activation exists in mutant MOR cells, which appears to be CaM-independent. How is it possible to reconcile the opposing actions of CaM on ERK activation? When CaM is localized in the plasma membrane, it can block heterologous signaling of MOR by preventing G protein coupling and retarding release of membrane-bound EGF-like ligands (Fig. 8). Under these conditions, the cell can respond to exogenous EGF, and there is sufficient intracellular CaM to interact with the Ras-Raf complex to activate ERK. As discussed above, a morphine-induced increase in intracellular CaM may additionally enhance the activation of the Ras-Raf complex. CaM release from the plasma membrane, initiated by opioid agonist binding to MOR, may alleviate the inhibitory effect of plasma membrane CaM on both MOR and metalloprotease, thereby stimulating shedding of endogenously expressed EGF-like ligands. The lack of inhibition by a metalloprotease inhibitor of DAMGO-induced EGFR phosphorylation in the CaM-antisense line supports the existence of a CaM-independent minor pathway. Since the mutant MOR cell line does not release CaM from the plasma membrane, it does not effectively utilize the EGF transactivation process in signaling to ERK. This is consistent with our observation that mutant MOR-mediated activation of ERK is insensitive to inhibitors of metalloproteases and PKC. Taken together, the data suggest that wild-type MOR stimulates ERK phosphorylation via a CaM- and PKC-dependent pathway that entails EGFR transactivation. It appears that Ca2+/CaM plays a role not only at the level of MOR, but also at additional site(s) in the EGF segment of the pathway. However, as shown by the CaM mutant MOR studies, minor pathways, independent of CaM and EGFR transactivation, may also lead to activation of ERK.

Biochemical characterization revealed an unusual substrate specificity of the purified enzyme for amorphous poly((R)-3-hydroxyalkanoates) (PHA) such as native granules of natural poly((R)-3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) or poly((R)-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHV), artificial cholate-coated granules of natural PHB or PHV, atactic poly((R,S)-3-hydroxybutyrate), and oligomers of (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate (3HB) with six or more 3HB units. The enzyme has the unique property to recognize the physical state of the polymeric substrate by discrimination between amorphous PHA (good substrate) and denatured, partially crystalline PHA (no substrate). The pentamers of 3HB or 3HV were identified as the main products of enzymatic hydrolysis of native PHB or PHV, respectively. No activity was found with any denatured PHA, oligomers of (R)-3HB with five or less 3HB units, poly(6-hydroxyhexanoate), substrates of lipases such as tributyrin or triolein, substrates for amidases/nitrilases, DNA, RNA, casein,N-α-benzoyl-l-arginine-4-nitranilide, or starch. The purified enzyme (Mr 36,209) was remarkably stable and active at high temperature (60 °C), high pH (up to 12.0), low ionic strength (distilled water), and in solvents (e.g. n-propyl alcohol). The depolymerase contained no essential SH groups or essential disulfide bridges and was insensitive to high concentrations of ionic (SDS) and nonionic (Triton and Tween) detergents. Characterization of the cloned structural gene (phaZ7) and the DNA-deduced amino acid sequence revealed no homologies to any PHB depolymerase or any other sequence of data banks except for a short sequence related to the active site serine of serine hydrolases. A classification of the enzyme into a new family (family 9) of carboxyesterases (Arpigny, J. L., and Jaeger, K.-E. (1999) Biochem. J. 343, 177–183) is suggested.

PHAs are deposited intracellularly in the form of inclusion bodies (“granules”) to levels up to 90% of the cellular dry weight. The subject was reviewed recently (1Madison L.L. Huisman G.W. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 21-53Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Poly((R)-3-hydroxybutyric acid) (PHB) is the most abundant polyester in bacteria. Bacterial copolymers containing randomly distributed (R)-3-hydroxybutyric and (R)-3-hydroxyvaleric units (poly(3HB-co-3HV)) have been commercialized for over a decade under the trade name Biopol®. Any research on the biodegradation of PHA should clearly distinguish between (i) extracellular PHA degradation and (ii) intracellular PHA degradation. (i) Extracellular degradation is the utilization of an exogenous carbon/energy source by a not-necessarily-accumulating microorganism. The source of this extracellular polymer is PHA-released by accumulating cells after death. The ability to degrade PHA is widely distributed among bacteria and depends on the secretion of specific PHA depolymerases that are carboxyesterases (EC 3.1.1) and hydrolyze the water-insoluble polymer to water-soluble monomers or oligomers (2Jendrossek D. Schirmer A. Schlegel H.G. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1996; 46: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 3Jendrossek D. Scheper T. Advances in Biochemical Engineering/Bio/Technology: Biopolyesters. Springer-Verlag, Berlin2001: 293-325Google Scholar). (ii) Intracellular degradation is the active mobilization (hydrolysis) of an endogenous carbon/energy storage reservoir by the accumulating bacterium itself. The differentiation between extra- and intracellular degradation is necessary, because PHA in vivo and outside the bacteria are present in two different biophysical states. In intracellular PHA granules the high molecular mass polymer (105–106 Da) is in the amorphous “rubbery” state (highly mobile chains in disordered conformation), and the granule surface layer consists of proteins and phospholipids (4Steinbüchel A. Aerts K. Babel W. Föllner C. Liebergesell M. Madkour M.H. Mayer F. Pieper-Fürst U. Pries A. Valentin H.E. Wieczorek R. Can. J. Microbiol. 1995; 41: 94-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Upon extraction from the cell, the granule surface layer is either damaged or lost (5Merrick J.M. Lundgren D.G. Pfister R.M. J. Bacteriol. 1965; 89: 234-239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the polyester chains tend to adopt ordered helical conformations (6Cornibert J. Marchessault R.H. Macromolecules. 1975; 8: 296-305Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and develop a crystalline phase. Extracellular PHB, for example, is a partially crystalline polymer (typical degree of crystallinity 50–60%) (7Barham P.J. Keller A. Otun E.L. Holmes P.A. J. Materials Sci. 1984; 19: 2781-2794Crossref Scopus (901) Google Scholar, 8Scandola M. Pizzoli M. Ceccorulli G. Cesaro A. Paoletti S. Navarini L. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1988; 10: 373-377Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar) with an amorphous fraction characterized by the same glass transition temperature as native PHB (Tg ∼ 0 °C) and a crystalline phase that melts in the range of 170–180 °C (8Scandola M. Pizzoli M. Ceccorulli G. Cesaro A. Paoletti S. Navarini L. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1988; 10: 373-377Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). For the sake of clarity, in the present paper PHA in the native state (i.e. in the intracellular granules) are indicated as nPHA, whereas the same polyesters in the partially crystalline form are denoted as denatured PHA (dPHA). The same notation is used to differentiate PHA depolymerases according to their ability to hydrolyze nPHA (nPHA depolymerases) or dPHA (dPHA depolymerases). A number of extracellular PHB depolymerases have been isolated to date. Their structure and specificity have been reviewed recently (2Jendrossek D. Schirmer A. Schlegel H.G. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1996; 46: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 3Jendrossek D. Scheper T. Advances in Biochemical Engineering/Bio/Technology: Biopolyesters. Springer-Verlag, Berlin2001: 293-325Google Scholar). One of the best studied PHA-degrading bacteria is Paucimonas lemoignei (formerly Pseudomonas lemoignei) (9Jendrossek D. Int. J. Syst. Evol. Microbiol. 2001; 51: 905-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). It belongs to the β subclass of Proteobacteria, and its 16S rRNA sequence is related to Herbaspirillum andOxalobacter species. P. lemoignei is unique among PHA-degrading bacteria, because it is able to synthesize at least six different extracellular PHA depolymerases (PhaZ1 to PhaZ6 (3Jendrossek D. Scheper T. Advances in Biochemical Engineering/Bio/Technology: Biopolyesters. Springer-Verlag, Berlin2001: 293-325Google Scholar)). All extracellular PHA depolymerases from P. lemoignei analyzed thus far degrade dPHA but are inactive toward undamaged nPHA. They are therefore dPHA depolymerases, similar to all known extracellular PHA depolymerases secreted by other microorganisms (3Jendrossek D. Scheper T. Advances in Biochemical Engineering/Bio/Technology: Biopolyesters. Springer-Verlag, Berlin2001: 293-325Google Scholar). The inability of the mentioned extracellular dPHA depolymerases to degrade the natural polyester in its native amorphous form (such as in nPHB) has been alternatively tested using poly((R,S)-3-hydroxybutyrate) as a synthetic analog of the natural polyester. This polymer contains 50% monomer units in S configuration, randomly distributed along the chain (atactic PHB, aPHB). Crystallization is totally hindered, and aPHB is a completely amorphous polymer (10Scandola M. Focarete M.L. Adamus G. Sikorska W. Baranowska I. Swierczek S. Gnatowski M. Kowalczuk M. Jedlinski Z. Macromolecules. 1997; 30: 2568-2574Crossref Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Intensive investigations using PHB depolymerase A (PhaZ5) from P. lemoignei have shown no significant activity of this enzyme toward aPHB. However, the enzyme hydrolyzed aPHB when this amorphous polymer was blended, or copolymerized, with a variety of crystalline polyesters (10Scandola M. Focarete M.L. Adamus G. Sikorska W. Baranowska I. Swierczek S. Gnatowski M. Kowalczuk M. Jedlinski Z. Macromolecules. 1997; 30: 2568-2574Crossref Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 11Scandola M. Focarete M.L. Gazzano M. Matuszowicz A. Sikorska W. Adamus G. Kurcok P. Kowalczuk M. Jedlinski Z. Macromolecules. 1997; 30: 7743-7748Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 12Focarete M.L. Ceccorulli G. Scandola M. Kowalczuk M. Macromolecules. 1998; 31: 8485-8492Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Hydrolytic activity toward aPHB was clearly of an endo type because of the presence of S units along the chain, which are known not to be recognized by PHB depolymerases (10Scandola M. Focarete M.L. Adamus G. Sikorska W. Baranowska I. Swierczek S. Gnatowski M. Kowalczuk M. Jedlinski Z. Macromolecules. 1997; 30: 2568-2574Crossref Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 13Bachmann B.M. Seebach D. Macromolecules. 1999; 32: 1777-1784Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The conclusion was drawn that in aPHB, efficient enzyme binding to the substrate is prevented by exceeding mobility of the polymer chains in the amorphous rubbery state. Conversely, binding is promoted in both dPHB and in the above-mentioned aPHB-containing blends (10Scandola M. Focarete M.L. Adamus G. Sikorska W. Baranowska I. Swierczek S. Gnatowski M. Kowalczuk M. Jedlinski Z. Macromolecules. 1997; 30: 2568-2574Crossref Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 11Scandola M. Focarete M.L. Gazzano M. Matuszowicz A. Sikorska W. Adamus G. Kurcok P. Kowalczuk M. Jedlinski Z.

Macromolecules. 1998; 31: 8485-8492Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar) by the presence of a stable crystalline phase. Although all available evidence shows that extracellular PHA depolymerases are inactive toward rubbery amorphous substrates such as nPHA granules and aPHB, recently unexpected high levels of a novel extracellular enzymatic activity of P. lemoignei that hydrolyzed both nPHB granules and aPHB was detected. This discovery prompted us to the present investigation on the activity of a newly isolated extracellular PHB depolymerase of P. lemoignei with a unique behavior, previously considered typical ofintracellular PHB depolymerases. Escherichia coli strains XL1blue and DH5α and P. lemoignei (DSMZ7445) were used in this study (9Jendrossek D. Int. J. Syst. Evol. Microbiol. 2001; 51: 905-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). E. coli was grown at 37 °C on Luria Bertani medium with additions as indicated, and P. lemoignei was grown at 30 °C in Stinson and Merrick's mineral salts medium (14Stinson M.W. Merrick J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 119: 152-161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with 50 mmsodium succinate or 0.5% 3HB. Denatured semicrystalline PHB (dPHB) and denatured poly(3-hydroxyvalerate) (dPHV) were isolated from gluconate- or valerate-grown cells of Ralstonia eutropha H16 (DSMZ428) or Chromobacterium violaceum (DSMZ30191), respectively, by sodium hypochlorite digestion and subsequent solvent extraction with acetone/diethylether as described elsewhere (15Jendrossek, D., Müller, B., and Schlegel, H. G. (1993)Eur. J. Biochem.217,Google Scholar). Denatured poly(3-hydroxyoctanoate) (dPHO) was purified from octanoate-grown cells of Pseudomonas oleovorans (ATCC 29347) by chloroform extraction and repeated methanol precipitation. nPHB and nPHV granules with intact surface layers were prepared from crude extracts (French press) of accumulated cells by two subsequent glycerol density gradient centrifugations as described recently (16Handrick R. Reinhardt S. Jendrossek D. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5916-5918Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). nPHO granules were purified by sodium phosphate-buffered glycerol density gradient centrifugation with or without 50 mm dithiothreitol + 1% (w/v) SDS (pH 8.0) to prevent self-hydrolysis by granule-bound depolymerases. Artificial cholate-coated PHA granules were prepared by emulsifying 3 ml of a PHA solution in chloroform (12.5% (w/v)) with an aqueous solution of sodium cholate or SDS (30 ml, 50 mm), respectively, by ultrasonication and subsequent evaporation of the solvent as described in Ref. 17Horowitz D.M. Sanders J.K.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 2695-2702Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar. The granules obtained were purified by glycerol density gradient centrifugation. The amorphous state of the granules was verified by x-ray diffraction (18Kawaguchi Y. Doi Y. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1990; 70: 151-156Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Films of bacterial dPHB (PHB GO8 granules from ICI, average molecular weight (Mn) = 5.39 × 105, polydispersity index = 4.11) were obtained by granule compression molding in a Carver C12 laboratory press (T = 195 °C, 1 min, 2 ton/m2 pressure) between Teflon plates. The obtained dPHB films (thickness ∼ 0.2 mm) were aged for 3 weeks at room temperature to obtain a stable degree of crystallinity. Films of atactic PHB (aPHB, Mn= 31000, weight averageMr/Mn = 1.1), synthesized as reported previously (19Kurcok P. Kowalczuk M. Hennek K. Jedlinski Z. Macromolecules. 1992; 25: 2017-2020Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 20Jedlinski Z. Kurcok P. Lenz R.W. J. Macromol. Sci., Pure Appl. Chem., A. 1995; 32: 797-810Crossref Google Scholar), were prepared by casting a dichloromethane solution of aPHB on thin polypropylene sheets as described earlier (10Scandola M. Focarete M.L. Adamus G. Sikorska W. Baranowska I. Swierczek S. Gnatowski M. Kowalczuk M. Jedlinski Z. Macromolecules. 1997; 30: 2568-2574Crossref Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Linear and cyclic oligomers of (R)-3HB or (S)-3HB with defined number of units were prepared according to Ref. 21Bachmann B.M. Seebach D. Helv. Chim. Acta. 1998; 81: 2430-2461Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar and were kindly provided by P. Waser and D. Seebach (ETH Zürich, Switzerland). 10 liters of a succinate-grown (80 h) culture of P. lemoigneiwere harvested by centrifugation. The cell-free culture fluid was concentrated by ultrafiltration (cut off size 10 kDa) and subsequent ammonium sulfate precipitation (30–85%). The proteins of the 85% precipitation step were dissolved in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and diafiltrated against 10 mm succinate NaOH, pH 4.7, containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 5% (v/v) glycerol. After centrifugation (10 min, 3,800 × g), the sample (250 ml, 153 mg) was applied to a CM-Sepharose CL-6B column (diameter, 26 mm; bed volume, 100 ml; flow rate, 0.75 ml/min) that had been equilibrated with the same buffer. After washing with equilibration buffer, the proteins were eluted by a linear gradient of NaCl (0–200 mm in equilibration buffer, 750 ml). Protein fractions were tested for activity toward both dPHB and nPHB. Succinate-grown cells contained high levels of dPHB depolymerase A (PhaZ5) and dPHB depolymerase B (PhaZ2) (2Jendrossek D. Schirmer A. Schlegel H.G. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1996; 46: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 3Jendrossek D. Scheper T. Advances in Biochemical Engineering/Bio/Technology: Biopolyesters. Springer-Verlag, Berlin2001: 293-325Google Scholar) in addition to a previously undetected activity toward nPHB. dPHB depolymerase A (PhaZ5), dPHB depolymerase B (PhaZ2), and a new nPHB depolymerase were eluted around 17, 50–55, and 55–65 mm NaCl, respectively. dPHB depolymerase A (PhaZ5) turned out to be homogeneous and was stored at −20 °C. Peaks of dPHB depolymerase B (PhaZ2) and of the new nPHB depolymerase activity overlapped partially. Separation of dPHB depolymerase B from nPHB depolymerase was performed by applying the diafiltrated (25 mm 1,3-diaminopropane-HCl, pH 10.5) and concentrated pool (97 ml, 58 mg) onto a Mono-P column (diameter, 5 mm; bed volume, 4 ml; flow rate, 0.5 ml/min) equilibrated with the same buffer. After washing with 5 bed volumes of equilibration buffer, the proteins were eluted by 46 ml of diluted (1:60) Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Pharmalyte® polybuffer, pH range 8.0–10.0, pH (HCl) 8.0. The new nPHB depolymerase activity appeared between pH 9.3 and 8.8 with a maximum at pH 9.2. dPHB depolymerase B was separated completely and appeared between pH 9.4 and 9.6. Fractions containing high amounts of nPHB depolymerase or dPHB depolymerase activity were pooled separately, dialyzed against 25 mm diaminopropane buffer, pH 9.0, and stored at −20 °C. 10 mg of purified nPHB depolymerase PhaZ7 (38,000 units, 7.8% yield) and 1.1 mg of purified dPHB depolymerase B were obtained. All enzyme preparations were homogeneous (>98%) as judged by SDS-PAGE analysis and subsequent silver-staining. Lipases (from pig and Candida antarctica (Lip II)) were obtained from Sigma.Pseudomonas aeruginosa lipase and recombinant esterases ofPseudomonas fluorescens (22Krebsfänger N. Schierholz K. Bornscheuer U.T. J. Biotechnol. 1998; 60: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) or Streptomyces diastachochromogenes (23Khalmeyer V. Bornscheuer U.T. Biotechnol. Lett. 1999; 21: 101-104Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar) were gifts from K.-E. Jaeger and U. Bornscheuer, respectively. The activity of PHB depolymerases was assayed photospectroscopically at 650 nm in a microtiterplate reader (KC4, Bio-tek © Instruments, Inc.) using 5–20-μl samples in a 200-μl assay mixture at 40 °C. For determination of dPHB depolymerase activity the assay mixture contained 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm CaCl2, and 500 μg/ml sodium hypochlorite-purified dPHB granules. For the assay of nPHB depolymerase activity, the assay mixture contained 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 1 mm CaCl2, and 500 μg/ml nPHB granules purified from R. eutropha as described earlier (16Handrick R. Reinhardt S. Jendrossek D. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5916-5918Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). 1 unit of activity is defined as the decrease of one A650 unit in 1 min. Alternatively, PHB depolymerase activity was assayed by titration of the released acid using a recording titristat consisting of a pH micro electrode, pH meter 620, impulsomat 614, dosimat 665, and a 10-ml syringe burett (Meterohm, Herisau, Switzerland). The reaction mixture (4–10 ml) contained 250 μg/ml purified nPHA granules in distilled water at 40 °C. The pH of the assay mixture was maintained at pH 9.0, 8.0, or 7.5 (depending on the experiment) by the addition of 10-μl pulses of 10 or 2 mm NaOH. The reaction was started with 10–100 μl (0.5–5 μg) of the depolymerase. When necessary, the enzyme was diluted with water. For the assay of 3HB oligomer hydrolysis, 2 mg of the oligomer dissolved in 0.5 ml of dichloromethane were used to coat the bottom and ∼5 mm of the inside walls of the reaction vessel by evaporation resulting in a thin film of the oligomer. 2 ml of distilled water were added, and the pH was adjusted to 7.5 or 9.0 using the titristat at 40 °C as described above. The reaction was started by the addition of the enzyme. 1 unit of activity is the release of 1 μmol acid/min. The activity of PHB depolymerases was assayed by incubating film samples (12.5 × 7 mm2, initial weight 15–25 mg) in duplicate at 37 ± 0.1 °C in separate vials containing 1.0 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, 1 mm CaCl2, and 2.8 μg/ml enzyme. The films were removed from the enzymatic solution after 20 h, washed with distilled water, and dried under vacuum over P2O5 at room temperature to a constant weight (Sartorius RC210D electronic balance, reproducibility ± 0.02 mg). After each incubation interval, enzymatic hydrolysis was quantified as weight loss normalized to the exposed film surface area (Δm/S). Over the time scale of the activity assay no appreciable weight losses were found in control tests run without enzyme. The test for lipolytic activity using Rhodamine B-triolein plates and tributyrin were performed as described elsewhere (24Kouker G. Jaeger K.-E. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1987; 53: 211-213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The assay of lipases LipA and LipB for nPHB depolymerase activity and assay for esterase activity usingp-nitrophenyl-hydroxyalkanoates (10 mm dissolved in ethanol, final concentration of 0.25 mm) with a chain length of the fatty acid moiety of 2–16 carbon atoms was performed by K.-E. Jaeger (Bochum, Germany) according to the procedure described in Ref. 25Eggert T. Pencreac'h G. Douchet I. Verger R. Jaeger K.-E. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6459-6496Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar. Alternatively, gum arabicum and deoxycholate of the reaction mixture were omitted, and the reaction was performed in the absence of any detergents in 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 1 mm CaCl2 at 40 °C. Low but significant autohydrolysis rates of the esters were taken into account for each assay. The assay mixture contained 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 (dPHB depolymerase) or 9.0 (nPHB depolymerase), 1 mm CaCl2, and 500 μg/ml dPHB granules (or nPHB granules) purified from R. eutropha. The reaction was started by the addition of 1.25 μg of purified PhaZ7. After incubation at 40 °C for 5 min the granules were centrifuged, and the activity of the soluble depolymerase in the supernatant was assayed as described above. The pellet was washed once with assay buffer (1 ml) at room temperature and centrifuged again. The washed pellet was resuspended with SDS-denaturing buffer (10 μl), heated to 95 °C for 3 min, and centrifuged again. The supernatant (∼10 μl) was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Alternatively, the washed pellet was resuspended in 2-propanol and centrifuged. The activity of the solubilized depolymerase was assayed as described above after removal of the solvent by dialysis. 1 mg of purified PhaZ7 was electroeluted from 12% SDS-PAGE, desalted, and concentrated by ultrafiltration. 200 μg of purified PhaZ7 were digested with BrCN at room temperature in the dark. The reaction mixture contained 200 μl of formic acid (70%) and two crystals of BrCN under nitrogen. After incubation for 19.5 h the sample was diluted 1:10 with water and frozen in liquid nitrogen before evaporation of formic acid. BrCN-generated fragments were separated by 15% Tricine SDS-PAGE (26Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10410) Google Scholar) or 12% SDS-PAGE and Western blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Coomassie Blue-stained bands of interest were cut out and subjected to N-terminal amino acid sequencing. Alternatively, 500 μg of purified PhaZ7 (Pharmalyte® polybuffer removed by 1.25 m NaCl and subsequent diafiltration on YM03 including desalting of the sample) were digested by trypsin (sequencing grade, Sigma) for 24 h at 37 °C. The assay mixture for reduction (12 h at 45 °C) contained 25 μl of urea (8 m in 0.4 mNH4HCO3 purified by Amberlite MB ion exchanger) and 5 μl of dithiothreitol (dithiothreitol, 45 mm). 5 μl of 100 mm iodoacetamide were added for alkylation (15 min). After dilution with water (ad 100 μl) 16.6 μg of trypsin were added. PhaZ7 was digested completely within 12 h at room temperature. Trypsin-generated fragments were separated by high pressure liquid chromatography using an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech LKB μ-separation unit with a Hyposil ODS column (150 × 2.1 mm; eluent A, 0.1% trifluoric acid in water; eluent B, 0.085% trifluoric acid in acetonitrile; linear gradient 7–50% B at 100 μl/min). Peaks containing internal fragments of trypsin were recognized by MALDI/TOF analysis and discarded. The remaining peaks were subjected directly to N-terminal amino acid sequencing. DNA manipulation was done by using standard procedures (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Chromosomal DNA of P. lemoignei was polymerase chain reaction-amplified using the oligonucleotides 5′-AARGGNACNCARACICARTAYGC-3′ and 5′-YTGDATDATNGCNCCIGTRTT-3′, which were derived from internal peptide fragments 1 (KGTQTQYA) and 6 (NTGAIIQ) of PhaZ7. The resulting 921-base pair amplification product was cloned into the EcoRV site of pBluescriptII SK(−). Additional primers (5′-GCTCCGGGCGTGGGTTAC-3′ and 5′-GTCTTGGTGCGGAAGTGG-3′) deduced from the primary polymerase chain reaction product were used for the construction of a DNA probe (866 base pairs) to detect recombinant E. coli DH5α clones harboring a genomic library of chromosomal DNA in pBluescriptII KS(−). Positive clones were used for DNA sequencing of both strands. Routinely, reducing and denaturing SDS-PAGE analysis was performed with 12% polyacrylamide gels (cross-linking degree, 0.8%). The gels were silver-stained. Alternatively, the proteins were electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes for the detection of glycoproteins using a DIG glycan detection kit from Roche Molecular Biochemicalsaccording to manufacturer instructions and with purified dPHB depolymerase A as a positive control (28Briese B.H. Schmidt B. Jendrossek D. J. Environ. Polym. Degrad. 1994; 2: 75-87Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Polyclonal mouse antibodies, raised against dPHB depolymerase PhaZ5, were obtained using SDS-PAGE-separated depolymerase material as the antigen. Electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometric analyses were performed using a Finnigan LCQ ion trap mass spectrometer (Finnigan, San Jose, CA). The freeze-dried supernatants from the enzymatic degradation of PHB and PHV were dissolved in chloroform/methanol (10:1 (v/v)), and such solutions were introduced continuously into the ESI source by means of the instrument syringe pump at a rate of 3 μl/min. Dry nitrogen was used for sample nebulization. The ESI source was operated at 4.25 kV, and the capillary heater was set to 200 °C. For multistage ESI MSnexperiments, mass-selected monoisotopic parent ions were isolated in the trap and collisionally activated with 33% ejection radio-frequence amplitude at standard helium pressure. The experiments were performed in the negative-ion mode. MALDI/TOF mass spectrometric analysis was performed on GSGfuture MS with time lag focusing and a 337-nm UV laser (GSG Mess-und Analysengeräte Vertriebsgesellschaft mbH). Samples (1 μl, desalted) were embedded in a 1-volume mixture of 3.5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid and acetonitrile/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (40:60 (v/v)) and dried at 21 °C. The system was calibrated with carbonic anhydrase B, and the measurement was performed at 20 kV. Extracellular nPHB depolymerase activity was followed during growth of P. lemoignei on acetate, succinate, 3HB, and dPHB. Samples were taken 9.5 (exponential growth phase) and 22 h (beginning of stationary phase) after inoculation. Low (<1 unit/ml) or medium (1–2.5 units/ml) activities of nPHB depolymerase were found during exponential growth on acetate and 3HB or on succinate and dPHB, respectively. nPHB depolymerase activity was almost unchanged in the 3HB and PHB cultures at the beginning of the stationary phase (1–2.5 units/ml), but the activities on succinate and acetate were increased significantly (>6 units/ml). Prolonged incubation of the cells for 2–4 days in succinate cultures resulted in the ncreased formation of nPHB depolymerase activity up to 50–60 units/ml. Apparently, the expression of nPHB depolymerase is derepressed after the exhaustion of the carbon source. Purification of the corresponding nPHB depolymerase protein (PhaZ7) was performed from 10 liters of culture fluid of an 80-h succinate culture as described under “Experimental Procedures.” 10 mg of purified nPHB depolymer"

One such compound E913 (Mr 484) specifically blocked the binding of macrophage inflammatory protein-1α (MIP-1α) to CCR5 (IC50 0.002 μm) and MIP-1α-elicited cellular Ca2+ mobilization (IC50 ∼ 0.02 μm). E913 potently inhibited the replication of laboratory and primary R5 HIV-1 strains as well as various multidrug-resistant monocyte/macrophage tropic (R5) HIV-1 at IC50 values of 0.03 to 0.06 μm. E913 was inactive against T cell tropic (X4) HIV-1; however, when combined with a CXCR4 antagonist AMD-3100, E913 potently and synergistically inhibited the replication of dualtropic HIV-1 and a 50:50 mixture of R5 and X4 HIV-1. Antagonism in anti-HIV-1 activity was not seen when E913 was combined with the reverse transcriptase inhibitor zidovudine or protease inhibitors. E913 proved to compete with the binding of antibodies to CCR5 which recognize the C-terminal half of the second extracellular loop (ECL2B) of CCR5. E913 and its analogs are acid-resistant and orally bioavailable in rodents.

The limitation of antiviral therapy of AIDS is exacerbated by complicated regimens, the development of drug-resistant HIV-1 variants (5Kavlick M.F. Mitsuya H. De Clercq E. The Art of Antiretroviral Therapy. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.2001: 279-312Google Scholar), and a number of inherent adverse effects. Successful antiviral drugs, in theory, exert their virus-specific effects by interacting with viral receptors, virally encoded enzymes, viral structural components, viral genes, or their transcripts without disturbing cellular metabolisms or functions (2Mitsuya H. Erickson J. Merigan T.C. Bartlet J.G. Bolognesi D. Textbook of AIDS Medicine, Second Edition. Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore1999: 751-780Google Scholar). However, at present, no antiretroviral drug or agent is likely to be completely specific for HIV-1 and to be devoid of toxicity or side effects in the therapy of AIDS, which has been a critical issue since patients with AIDS and its related diseases will have to administer antiretroviral therapy for a long period of time, perhaps for the rest of their lives (4Finzi D. Blankson J. Siliciano J.D. Margolick J.B. Chadwick K. Pierson T. Smith K. Lisziewicz J. Lori F. Flexner C. Quinn T.C. Chaisson R.E. Rosenberg E. Walker B. Gange S. Gallant J. Siliciano R.F. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 512-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1769) Google Scholar). Thus, the identification of new antiretroviral drugs which have unique mechanisms of action and produce no or least minimal side effects remains an important therapeutic objective (2Mitsuya H. Erickson J. Merigan T.C. Bartlet J.G. Bolognesi D. Textbook of AIDS Medicine, Second Edition. Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore1999: 751-780Google Scholar). In this respect, certain chemokine receptor antagonists might produce no or minimal toxicity. Approximately 1% of Caucasians have a gene encoding a mutant form of CCR5 called δ-32, which is known to contribute to their resistance against HIV-1 infection (6Liu R. Paxton W.A. Choe S.

Such CCR5-deficient individuals apparently do not have significant health problems and CCR5 knockout mice do not show grave pathological defects (6Liu R. Paxton W.A. Choe S. Ceradini D. Martin S.R.

Such apparently limited effects of the lack of CCR5 render this receptor an attractive target for possible intervention of HIV-1 infection. It should be noted, however, that CCR5-lacking mice have some aberrant immunological defects and compromised defense to some pathogens (8Zhou Y. Kurihara T. Ryseck R.P. Yang Y. Ryan C. Loy J. Warr G. Bravo R. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4018-4025PubMed Google Scholar, 9Salazar-Mather T.P. Orange J.S. Biron C.A. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Most recently, CCR5-lacking HIV-1- and hepatitis C virus-coinfected individuals were shown to have significantly higher levels of hepatitis C virus than their counterparts who have the normal form of CCR5 (10Woitas R.P. Rockstroh J.K. Bockemuehl R. Schepers K. Stoschus B. Matz B. Sauerbruch T. Spengler U. The 8th Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections. Chicago, IL2001Google Scholar). Hence, the sustained, long-term suppression of the effects of chemokines and/or chemokine receptors may produce adverse effects and caution should be used in the development of chemokine receptor antagonists as potential therapeutics. In this study, we designed, synthesized, and identified a novel small non-peptide CCR5 antagonist, E913, and its related spirodiketopiperazine derivatives, which show potent HIV-1-specific antiviral activity, and examined the effects of E913 combined with other classes of anti-HIV agents. We demonstrate that E913 and its related compounds block the infectivity and replication of laboratory, clinical strains of HIV-1, highly drug-resistant HIV-1 variants, dualtropic HIV-1, and mixed populations of X4 and R5 variants when properly combined with other classes of anti-HIV-1 agents. Spirodiketopiperazine derivatives including E913 were newly designed and synthesized as will be described elsewhere. The structures of E913 and three selected such compounds examined in this study are illustrated in Fig.1: E910, 1-butyl-2,5-dioxo-3-(2-methylpropyl)-9-(6-phenylhexyl)-1,4,9-triazaspiro(5,5)undecane; E913, 1-butyl-2,5-dioxo-3-cyclohexylmethyl-9-(1,4-benzodioxan-6-ylmethyl)-1,4, 9-triazaspiro[5.5]undecane; E916, 1-butyl-2,5-dioxo-3-cyclohexylmethyl-9-(2-phenylimidazol-5-yl methyl)-1,4,9-triazaspiro[5.5]undecane; and E917, 1-butyl-2,5-dioxo-3-(2-methypropyl)-9-[(4-phenoxyphenyl)methyl]-1,4,9-triazaspiro[5.5]undecane.

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBM) were isolated from buffy coats with Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation and cultured at a concentration of 106cells/ml in RPMI 1640-based culture medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (HyClone, Logan, UT) and antibiotics with 10 μg/ml phytohemagglutinin (PHA) for 3 days prior to use.

Four clinical HIV-1 strains, HIV-1JSL, HIV-1MM, HIV-1TM, and HIV-1MOKW, were also employed. HIV-1JSL, HIV-1MM, and HIV-1TM were isolated from patients with AIDS who had received 9–11 anti-HIV-1 drugs in the past 32–83 months and were highly resistant to a number of antiviral agents as tested in vitro (19Yoshimura K.

HIV-1MOKW was isolated from a drug-naive Japanese patient with AIDS and was confirmed to lack any known drug resistance-associated amino acid mutations. All clinical HIV-1 strains were passaged once or twice in PHA-PBM. Nucleotide sequences of the polymerase- and protease-encoding regions were determined for the clinical HIV-1 strains as previously described (19Yoshimura K. Kato R. Yusa K. Kavlick M.F. Maroun V.

Human CCR5 cDNA was amplified with polymerase chain reaction from a human placenta cDNA library, purified, and subcloned into a mammalian expression vector pEF6/V5-His (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), in which the V5-His tag epitope was deleted. CHO cells were transfected with thus obtained CCR5 plasmids by using DMRIE-C (Life Technologies, Inc.), selected in the presence of 5 μg/ml blasticidin S hydrochloride (Kaken Pharmaceutical, Tokyo), and CHO cells stably expressing CCR5 (CCR5-CHO cells) were obtained. CCR5-CHO cells (1.2 × 105 cells/well) were plated onto 48-well, flat-bottomed culture plates, incubated for 18–24 h, rinsed once with Ham's F-12 medium containing 20 mm Hepes and 0.5% BSA. These adherent CCR5-CHO cells were exposed to 0.1 nm125I-labeled MIP-1α in the presence of varying concentrations of a test compound at room temperature for 40 min, washed thoroughly with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and lysed with 0.5 ml of 1 n NaOH. The radioactivity in 0.5 ml of the cell lysates was determined with COBRA γ-counter (number 5010; Packard, Tokyo). The nonspecific binding of the labeled chemokine to the cells was determined based on the radioactivity from the wells added with 100 nm non-radiolabeled chemokine. The inhibition by test compounds of the binding of 0.1 nm125I-labeled MCP-1 to CCR2-expressing CHO (CCR2-CHO) cells was similarly determined. CCR5-CHO cells (3 × 104cells/well) were plated onto 96-well, flat-bottomed microtiter culture plates, incubated for 18–24 h, loaded with 5 mm Fura-2/AM (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) for 60 min at 37 °C in Ham's F-12 containing 20 mm Hepes and 2.5 mmprobenecid, and washed once with Hanks' solution containing 20 mm Hepes and 2.5 mm probenecid. A test compound was added at varying concentrations and the cells were exposed to MIP-1α at a concentration of 30 nm, and a relative increase of the cytosolic Ca2+ level at 3 min after the MIP-1α exposure was determined using Spectrofluorometer FDSS-2000 and 4000 (Hamamatsu Photonics, Shizuoka, Japan). The inhibition by a test compound of the cytosolic Ca2+ mobilization elicited by MCP-1 (30 nm), MDC (10 nm), or SDF-1α (30 nm) was determined using the same conditions. CCR5-CHO cells were employed for the chemokine binding inhibition assay. The confluent CCR5-CHO cells were lifted off with 1 mm EDTA/PBS, washed once with F-12 medium, suspended in 0.75% fetal calf serum-containing F-12 (FACS staining buffer), and incubated in the presence of varying concentrations of a test compound for 15 min on ice.

FACS analysis was performed with a Becton Dickinson FACSort flow cytometer using the CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). The MAGI assay using CCR5-MAGI cells was conducted as previously described (21Uchida H. Maeda Y. Mitsuya H. Antiviral Res. 1997; 36: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, CCR5-MAGI cells were plated (104 cells/well) and cultured in 96-well, flat-bottomed microculture plates. After a 24-h incubation, the cells were exposed to various concentrations of a test compound and HIV-1 virus in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 15% fetal calf serum, and were stained at 48 h of culture with chlorophenol red β-d-galactopyranoside as previously described (22Felgner J.H.

A solution (100 μl) containing 10 mm chlorophenol red β-d-galactopyranoside, 2 mmMgCl2, and 0.1 m KH2PO4was added to each well, the mixture was incubated at room temperature in the dark for 30 min, and the optical density (wavelength: 570 nm) was measured in a microplate reader (Vmax, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Drug concentrations that brought about 50% inhibition (IC50) of the β-galactosidase activity were determined. All assays were performed in triplicate. PHA-PBM (1 × 106/ml) were exposed to 50 TCID50 of each HIV-1 strain and cultured in the presence or absence of various concentrations of test compounds in 10-fold serial dilutions in 96-well microculture plates. The amounts of p24 antigen produced by the cells were determined on day 7 of culture by using a fully automated chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay system (Lumipulse F; Fujirebio Inc., Tokyo) (24Sakai A. Hirabayashi Y. Aizawa S. Tanaka M. Ida S. Oka S. Kansenshogaku Zasshi. 1999; 73: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), which has an extensive dynamic range of 10–100,000 pg/ml p24. Drug concentrations that suppressed the production of p24 Gag protein by 50% (IC50) were determined by comparison with the p24 production level in drug-free control cell cultures (25Shirasaka T.

In order to assess the cytotoxicity of a test compound, PHA-PBM (1 × 106/ml) were cultured in the presence or absence of various concentrations of the compound in 5-fold serial dilutions in 96-well microculture plates. In 7 days of culture, 100 μl of the medium was removed from each well, and 10 μl of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide solution (7.5 mg/ml) was added to each well in the plate, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 3 h. After incubation, to dissolve the formazan crystals, 100 μl of acidified isopropyl alcohol containing 4% Triton X-100 was added and the optical density was measured in a microplate reader. All assays were performed in triplicate. We designed, synthesized, and tested ∼130 spirodiketopiperazine derivatives and examined whether such spirodiketopiperazine derivatives blocked the binding of 125I-labeled MIP-1α to CCR5-CHO cells and MIP-1α-elicited cellular Ca2+ mobilization. We identified 4 compounds, E910, E913, E916, and E917, which potently inhibited the binding and Ca2+ mobilization at IC50 values of 0.002 to 0.1 μm (TableI).Table IInhibitory activity of novel CCR5 antagonists in the Ca2+ assay and the chemokine-chemokine receptor binding assayCompoundBinding assay (IC50, μm)Ca2+ assay (IC50, μm)MIP-1αMCP-1MIP-1α/CCR5MCP-1/CCR2MDC/CCR4SDF-1α/CXCR4E9100.03 ± 0.005>300.1 ± 0.0317 ± 0.517 ± 324 ± 2E9130.002 ± 0.0005>300.02 ± 0.003>30>30>30E9160.007 ± 0.001>300.07 ± 0.03>30>30>30E9170.009 ± 0.0007>300.08 ± 0.02>30>30>30 Open table in a new tab As shown in Fig. 2, both E910 and E913 blocked the binding of MIP-1α to CCR5-CHO cells, while they failed to block the binding of MCP-1, whose primary receptor is CCR2, to CCR2-CHO cells (Fig. 2). We also asked whether E913 blocked the intracellular Ca2+ mobilization induced by MDC and SDF-1α, whose primary receptors are CCR4 and CXCR4, respectively, as well as MCP-1. E913 completely blocked MIP-1α-induced Ca2+ mobilization at 0.3 μm and beyond, however, it failed to block the Ca2+ mobilization induced with MDC, SDF-1α, and MCP-1 (Fig. 3).

As assessed in the MAGI assay, three spirodiketopiperazine derivatives, E913, E916, and E917, were highly potent against HIV-1BaL with IC50values of 0.03, 0.07, and 0.06 μm, respectively (TableII). In the antiviral assay using PHA-PBM as target cells, E913 was the most potent with an IC50value of 0.04 μm against HIV-1BaL although other three compounds were moderately active with IC50values of 0.1 to 0.5 μm (Table II). It should be noted that E913 was least cytotoxic against PHA-PBM as assessed with the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay with a selectivity index of 1,295. However, all four spirodiketopiperazine derivatives failed to block the replication of X4 HIV-1LAI and HIV-1NL4–3 in both assay systems, although a CXCR4 antagonist AMD-3100 was active against X4 HIV-1LAI and HIV-1NL4–3. It has been reported that certain C-C chemokines enhance the replication of X4 HIV-1 while SDF-1 enhances the replication of R5 HIV-1 by more than 3-fold in vitro (27Schols D. Proost P. Van Damme J.

Open table in a new tab The most potent and least cytotoxic CCR5 antagonist E913 was chosen for further testing against a variety of clinical HIV-1 isolates. Three (two R5 and one X4) clinical HIV-1 strains were isolated from patients with AIDS who had received 9–11 anti-HIV-1 drugs in the past 32–83 months and had lost response to all available antiviral regimens (19Yoshimura K.

All these HIV-1 isolates were highly resistant to a number of antiviral agents as testedin vitro (19Yoshimura K. Kato R. Yusa K. Kavlick M.F. Maroun V. Nguyen A. Mimoto T. Ueno T. Shintani M.

For example, zidovudine was highly active against the wild type HIV-1MOKW and its IC50value was as low as 0.001 μm. However, IC50values of zidovudine against three multidrug resistant HIV-1 variants (HIV-1JSL, HIV-1MM, and HIV-1TM) were 28–98-fold greater than that against the wild type HIV-1MOKW (Table III). All three drug-resistant HIV-1 also showed resistance to didanosine, stavudine, saquinavir, and nelfinavir. However, E913 was invariably potent against the wild type HIV-1MOKW and two drug-resistant R5 HIV-1JSLand HIV-1MM, while it failed to block the replication of X4 HIV-1TM. By contrast, AMD-3100 was potent against X4 HIV-1TM, but failed to block all three R5 HIV-1 strains (Table III).Table IIIAnti-HIV-1 activity of E913 and AMD-3100 against HIV-1 clinical isolates in PBMIC50(μm)aThe IC50 values were determined with the p24 assay.Wild-type R5MDR R5MDR X4HIV-1MOKWHIV-1JSLHIV-1MMHIV-1TMAZT0.001 ± 0.0020.03 ± 0.190.04 ± 0.0070.1 ± 0.06(1x)(28x)bNumbers in parentheses represent fold-changes of IC50 values against each isolate compared to IC50 values against the wild-type HIV-1MOKW.(41x)(98x)ddI0.48 ± 0.122.50 ± 0.353.9 ± 1.12.50 ± 0.25(1x)(5x)(8x)(5x)d4T0.015 ± 0.0040.10 ± 0.070.09 ± 0.060.05 ± 0.02(1x)(9x)(6x)(3x)SQV0.004 ± 0.0040.08 ± 0.040.37 ± 0.0650.07 ± 0.04(1x)(19x)(93x)(18x)NFV0.014 ± 0.004>1>1>1(1x)(>71x)(>71x)(>71x)E9130.04 ± 0.030.06 ± 0.010.05 ± 0.06>1(1x)(1x)(1x)(>25x)AMD-3100>1>1>10.008 ± 0.0006a The IC50 values were determined with the p24 assay.b Numbers in parentheses represent fold-changes of IC50 values against each isolate compared to IC50 values against the wild-type HIV-1MOKW. Open table in a new tab It was thought that any CCR5 antagonist alone or CXCR4 antagonist alone would not sufficiently block the replication of HIV-1 in patients where HIV-1 exists as a quasispecies. Therefore, we asked whether a combined use of both E913 and AMD-3100 blocked more effectively the infectivity and replication of HIV-1 in PHA-PBM. Against R5 HIV-1 (HIV-1BaL and HIV-1MM) and X4 HIV-1 (HIV-1NL4–3 and HIV-1TM), no apparent potentiation of activity was seen with the combination (Fig.4, A and B). When E913 and AMD-3100 were combined at various concentrations and tested against R5 or X4 HIV-1, no significant combination effects were observed (data not shown). However, as shown in Fig. 4 C, against two dualtropic HIV-1, HIV-189.6 (17Collman R. Balliet J.W. Gregory S.A. Friedman H. Kolson D.L. Nathanson N. Srinivasan A. J.

E913 at 5 μm only partially blocked the replication of HIV-189.6 and HIV-1ERS104pre (by 29 and 55%), respectively (Fig. 4 C). AMD-3100 at 0.1 μmquite effectively suppressed the replication of these dualtropic HIV-1 preparations, but not completely (by 95 and 94%, respectively).

However, the impact of this co-infection on the clinical outcome of HIV infection has not been elucidated. We herein demonstrate that the HBV X protein (HBx) superinduces ongoing HIV-1 replication and HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) transcription by synergizing with Tat protein and with T-cell activation signals. Although HBx cooperated with mitogenic stimuli in the induction of reporter plasmids harboring the HIV-1 κB enhancer, in both a NF-κB-dependent manner and a NF-AT-dependent manner, deletion of this element from the LTR did not affect the HBx-mediated up-regulation in the presence of Tat and/or mitogens. In contrast, mutation of the proximal LTR Sp1-binding sites abolished the HBx-mediated synergistic activation, but only when it was accompanied by deletion of the κB enhancer. When HBx was targeted to the nucleus, its ability to synergize with cellular activation stimuli was maintained. Furthermore, mutations of HBx affecting its interaction with the basal transcription machinery abrogated the synergistic activation by HBx, suggesting that this protein exerts its function by acting as a nuclear co-activator. These results indicate that HBx could contribute to a faster progression to AIDS in HBV-HIV co-infected individuals.

During the stage of clinical latency, the viral burden in the bloodstream is markedly decreased, and viral replication persists only in the lymphoid organs, whereas in most circulating CD4+ T-lymphocytes HIV-1 replication/transcription is not ongoing (1Pierson T. McArthur J. Siliciano R.F. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 665-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar[email protected]). It is generally accepted that in the cellular environment of resting T-lymphocytes HIV-1 remains in a quiescent state and that HIV-1 reactivation is dependent upon T-cell activation. HIV-1 gene expression and replication are controlled by an interplay of viral and host regulatory proteins that interact with cis-acting sequences located in the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR). Among the multiple regulatory elements of the HIV-1 LTR, the κB enhancer, which contains two copies of κB elements at nucleotides −104 to −81, is considered the main induciblecis-acting element (2Jones K.A. Peterlin B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 717-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Deletion or site-directed mutations of this regulatory sequence may affect LTR transcriptional activation induced by T-cell activation stimuli and by Tat protein (2Jones K.A. Peterlin B.M. Annu. Rev.

It has been widely demonstrated that the κB enhancer element binds and responds to NF-κB/Rel family of transcription factors, which are induced by a number of stimuli such as mitogens, cytokines, and specific T-cell activators (5Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4631) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been reported that members of the NF-AT family of transcription factors also bind the HIV κB enhancer (6Kinoshita S. Su L. Amano M. Timmerman L.A. Kaneshima H. Nolan G.P.

Mutations of these Sp1 sites affect both basal and Tat-induced LTR transcriptional activity (9Berkhout B. Jeang K.-T. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 139-149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, modulation of Sp1 phosphorylation by agents such as phosphatase inhibitors and by Tat-mediated recruitment of Sp1 to DNA-dependent protein kinase complex results in up-regulated expression of the HIV-1 LTR (10Vlach J.

Virol. 1998; 72: 2615-2629Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other authors have demonstrated that interaction between NF-κB and Sp1 mediates HIV-1 LTR activation (12Perkins N.D. Edwards N.L.

Downstream of the HIV-1 LTR transcription start site is located the TAR element (nucleotides +1 to +59), which forms an RNA stem-loop structure that is recognized by the HIV Tat protein. Two mechanisms have been proposed for Tat-mediated transactivation (2Jones K.A. Peterlin B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 717-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar, 14Cullen B.R.

Biol. 1997; 17: 6898-6905Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). First, Tat might favor elongation of nascent viral transcripts through its interaction with the Tat-associated kinase complex p-TEFb, leading to phosphorylation and increased processivity of RNA polymerase II. On the other hand, Tat might also enhance transcription initiation rate by its ability to interact with promoter-bound factors such as TATA binding protein, TFIIB, transcription factor-IIH, RNA polymerase II, and Sp1. The prevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in patients infected with HIV-1 is very common (17Hadler S.C. Judson F.N. O'Malley P.M. Altman N.L. Penley K. Buchbinder S. Schable C.A.

In addition, although HBV has a marked hepatic tropism, it has been shown that this virus is also able to infect T-lymphocytes (19Laure F. Zagury D. Saimont A.G. Gallo R.C. Hahn B.H. Brechot C.

However, the impact of this co-infection on the clinical outcome of HIV-1-infected patients has not been clearly established so far, probably because many other factors may also influence HIV-1 outcome (21Eskild A.

The HBV genome encodes a 17-kDa protein, termed HBx, that has been shown to function as a transcriptional transactivator of a variety of viral and cellular promoter/enhancer elements. HBx does not bind directly to DNA, but it is able to transactivate transcription through multiple cis-acting elements. The exact mechanism of HBx-mediated transactivation still remains unresolved. It has been shown that HBx interacts in the nucleus with components of the basal transcription machinery and with transcription factors, mimicking the cellular co-activator functions (26Qadri I.

In this report, we demonstrate that HBx synergizes with cellular activation to induce HIV-1 replication and with Tat and cellular activation to transactivate the HIV-1 LTR in Jurkat cells. We show that isolated HIV-1 κB enhancer is a target for HBx, in both a NF-κB-dependent manner and a NF-AT- dependent manner, but its deletion from the HIV-1 LTR does not affect the synergistic activation by HBx. In addition, we identify the two most proximal Sp1-binding sites of HIV-1 LTR as new HBx-responsive elements. Finally, we demonstrate that HBx induces the HIV-1 LTR transcriptional activity by acting as a nuclear co-activatior. The human lymphoblastoid T-cell line Jurkat was grown at 37 °C with a 5% CO2 atmosphere in RPMI 1640, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mmglutamine, and 50 μg/ml gentamycin. PMA and the calcium ionophoreA23187 were obtained from Sigma. The expression vectors pSV-HBx and pSV- hygro, harboring the HBx open reading frame from HBV and the bacterial hygromycin phosphotransferase gene, respectively, under the control of the simian virus 40 promoter, have been described previously (40Chirillo P. Falco M. Puri P.L. Artini M. Balsano C. Levrero M. Natoli G. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 641-646Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The expression vectors pNLSHBx-FLAG and pSLNHBx-FLAG, harboring a FLAG-tagged HBx open reading frame either with a nuclear localization signal (NLS) or with a nonfunctional mutated nuclear localization signal (SLN), respectively, were kindly provided by Dr. R.

The plasmid pCMV-Tat contains the two exons of HIV Tat gene (subtype LAI) and the simian virus 40 poly(A) cloned betweenXbaI and HindIII sites of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA). The vector pNL-Luc was generated by cloning the luciferase gene in HIV-1 proviral clone NL4–3 (44Adachi A. Gendelman H.E. Koening S. Folks T. Willey R. Rabson A. Martin M.A. J. Virol. 1986; 59: 284-291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Luciferase gene was excised from the plasmid pNL4–3.Luc.R-E (National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, catalog number 3418) with XhoI and BamHI and inserted in HIV-1 Nef gene. This proviral construct is fully competent for replication and express luciferase activity as a marker of viral gene expression. The vectors pXP1LTR wt and pXP1LTR ΔκB, which has been deleted in the κB enhancer element, were obtained by subcloning the fragment −644 to +77 of the HIV-1 LTR from LAI strain in the pXP1-Luciferase vector. pXP1LTR ΔTAR was obtained from pXP1LTR wt; briefly, the fragment −644 (BamHI) to +38 (SacI) was cloned in BamHI/SacI sites of pXP1. Then the vector was digested with SacI, blunt-ended with T4 DNApolimerase, and ligated to generate pXP1LTR ΔTAR, which contains a disrupted TAR element and a mutated downstream NFκB element (45Mallardo M.

The same approach was followed to generate pXP1LTR ΔκB ΔTAR from pXP1LTR ΔκB. The pXP1κB-Sp and pXP1Sp set of vectors were made by subcloning in pXP1 the −107 to + 77 and −81 to + 77 HIV-1 LTR fragments, respectively, obtained from the described previously NF-Sp CAT set of vectors (9Berkhout B. Jeang K.-T. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 139-149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pκB-TKLuc and pmκB-TKLuc vectors contain three copies of the κB enhancer sequence wild type (ACAAGGGACTTTCCGCTGGGGACTTTCCAGGGA) or four copies of the κB enhancer sequence mutated in both NF-κB-binding sites (ACAACTCACTTTCCGCTGCTCACTTTTCCAGGGA), respectively, upstream of the TK promoter and have been described previously as ENH-TK and mENH-TK luciferase vectors (46Bachelerie F. Alcamı́ J. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Virelizier J.L. Nature. 1991; 350: 709-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). This last construct still contains the described NF-AT-responsive element of the HIV-1 LTR (6Kinoshita S. Su L. Amano M. Timmerman L.A. Kaneshima H. Nolan G.P. Immunity. 1997; 6: 235-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Jurkat cells were transfected by electroporation. Briefly, 5 × 106cells were washed and resuspended in 0.35 ml of RPMI 10% serum with 7.5 μg of plasmid DNA. After incubation on ice, the cells were subjected to an electrical pulse (0.32 kV, 1500 microfarads, R ∞) using an Equibio (UK) apparatus. Then the cells were diluted in fresh medium and were either left untreated or stimulated with PMA (10 ng/ml) plus calcium ionophore (0.5 μm). At day 1 after transfection, half of the cells were harvested, and the cell extracts were assayed for luciferase activity using a Lumat LB9501 luminometer. The remaining cells were maintained in culture, and the supernatants were collected at days 1, 3, and 7 after transfection for CA-p24 detection using a p24 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit from Innogenetics (Ghent, Belgium). 5 × 106 Jurkat cells were transfected with 4.5–6 μg of the indicated plasmid DNAs using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. 36 h post-transfection cells were left untreated or stimulated for 16 h with PMA (10 ng/ml) plus calcium ionophore (0.5 μm). The cells were harvested, and the cell extracts were assayed for luciferase activity using a Lumat LB9501 luminometer. Nuclear extracts were prepared from Jurkat cells either untreated or stimulated with PMA (10 ng/ml) plus calcium ionophore (1 μm) for 4 h, as described previously (47Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar). Binding reactions were performed for 15 min at 4 °C in a volume of 20 μl containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 10% glycerol, 50 mm KCl, 6 mmMgCl2, 100 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 2.5 μg of poly(dI-dC), 1–2 ng of T4 kinase-labeled probe, and 2 μg of nuclear extract. The DNA-protein complexes were resolved by electrophoresis on a 5% polyacrylamide gel. The following oligonucleotide was used in the binding reactions: 5′-gatcACAAGGGACTTTCCGCTGGGGACTTTCCAGG-3′ (κB enhancer of the HIV-1 LTR). For supershift assays, 1 μl of the following antibodies was added 15 min before the labeled probe: anti-NF-ATp antiserum 67.1 (48Ho S.N. Jain J. Rao A. Hogan P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28181-28186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); anti-NF-ATc monoclonal antibody (Alexis Corp., San Diego, CA); anti-p50 antiserum, anti-p65 antiserum, and preimmune antiserum, kindly provided by Dr. E. Muñoz (University of Córdoba, Córdoba, Spain). To analyze whether HBx may influence HIV-1 replication, Jurkat cells were transiently co-transfected with the HIV-1 infectious recombinant clone pNL-Luc, in which the nefgene has been replaced by luciferase gene, along with the HBx expression vector pSV-HBx or the control plasmid pSV-hygro. The transfected cells were either left untreated or stimulated with PMA plus Ca2+ ionophore (PMA + Io), which mimic the T-cell activation signals (49Truneh A. Albert F. Golstein P. Schimitt-Verhulst A.M. Nature. 1985; 313: 318-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar), and the HIV-1 replication rate was analyzed by measuring CA-p24 antigen production in the culture supernatants at different time points (1, 3 and 7 days). As shown in Fig.1 A, both HBx expression and PMA + Io treatment were able to significantly enhance HIV-1 replication. Interestingly, when these two stimuli, HBx and PMA + Io, were combined, a strong synergistic effect was observed, reaching CA-p24 levels 4–5-fold higher than those obtained with PMA + Io alone at day 3 after transfection. Similar results were obtained with a noninfectious HIV-1 recombinant clone lacking the env gene that allows only a single cycle of viral replication (data not shown), thus ruling out that the up-regulation of CA-p24 production by HBx and/or PMA + Io was due to increased re-infection rather than enhanced HIV-1 production. Because enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay detection of CA-p24 antigen was not sensitive enough to detect differences of CA-p24 production at day 1 post-transfection, the effects of HBx and/or PMA + Io on HIV-1 replication at this time were also analyzed using the highly sensitive luciferase activity assay. In agreement with CA-p24 production data, HBx expression cooperated with PMA + Io treatment in the induction of HIV-1 replication at early times after transfection and cell activation (Fig. 1 B). To analyze whether the above effects of HBx on HIV-1 replication were regulated at the level of HIV-1 LTR transcriptional activity, Jurkat cells were transiently co-transfected with the plasmid pXP1LTR wt, containing the complete HIV-1 LTR (nucleotides −644 to +77) upstream of the luciferase reporter gene (Fig. 2), along with the HBx expression vector pSV-HBx or the control plasmid pSV-hygro. In addition, to evaluate the possible functional interplay between HBx and the HIV Tat protein, the construct pCMV-Tat or its control vector pcDNA3 was also included in the co-transfection experiments. As expected, the expression of Tat protein strongly enhanced the transcriptional activity of the HIV-1 LTR (Fig.3 A). In contrast, the expression of HBx induced only about 4–6-fold the HIV-1 LTR activity. However, a multiplicative induction was observed when HBx and Tat proteins were co-expressed (Fig. 3 A).Figure 3HBx further increases Tat- and T-cell activation-mediated HIV-1 LTR transcriptional up-regulation.Jurkat cells were co-transfected with 1 μg of pXP1LTR wt along with 2 μg of either pSV-HBx or the control plasmid pSV-hygro and 0.5 μg of either pCMV-Tat or the control plasmid pcDNA3. 36 h after transfection cells were either left untreated (A) or stimulated with PMA (10 ng/ml) plus calcium ionophore (0.5 μm) for 16 h prior to luciferase assay (B). The luciferase activities are represented as fold induction over the expression of pXP1LTR wt in the absence of any stimuli. The values shown represent the mean fold inductions ± S.E. of at least four independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To study the influence of HBx and/or Tat on HIV-1 LTR function in an activated cellular background, the transfected cells were treated with PMA + Io. Inductions of ∼35- and 97-fold over the effect of PMA + Io were observed by HBx and Tat expression, respectively, which were greater than multiplicative (Fig. 3 B). Thus, the expression of HBx or Tat proteins exerted a marked synergism with the mitogenic stimulation of the HIV-1 LTR. Interestingly, when both viral proteins were co-expressed a strong superinduction of 2800-fold over the effect of PMA + Io was obtained (Fig. 3 B). Taken together, these results indicate that HBx and Tat act at different levels and add their effects, whereas these viral proteins strongly synergize cellular activation, which implies cooperativity between HBx and/or Tat proteins and the signals elicited by PMA + Io. Among the regulatory elements of the HIV-1 LTR, the κB enhancer is considered the main inducible cis-acting element. Recently, it has been shown that in addition to NF-κB proteins, members of the NF-AT family also bind to the HIV-1 κB enhancer (6Kinoshita S. Su L. Amano M. Timmerman L.A. Kaneshima H. Nolan G.P. Immunity. 1997; 6: 235-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 7Macián F. Rao A. Mol. Cell.

Immunol. 2000; 94: 179-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The stimuli employed in this study to trigger T-cell activation (PMA + Io) may lead to activation and nuclear translocation of both NF-κB and NF-AT proteins. Therefore, to characterize the inducible protein complexes that interact with the κB enhancer, electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed using nuclear extracts from unstimulated or PMA + Io-treated Jurkat cells. Four inducible DNA-protein complexes (complexes 1–4) were observed when the κB oligonucleotide probe was incubated with nuclear extracts from PMA + Io-treated cells (Fig. 4 A). To identify the nature of these complexes, the binding reactions were preincubated with antibodies specific to p50, p65, NF-ATp and NF-ATc. The anti-p50 antiserum abolished the formation of complexes 2–4, and anti-p65 antiserum prevented the formation of complex 2. On the other hand, the anti-NF-ATc monoclonal antibody and the anti-NF-ATp antiserum induced the disappearance or reduced the intensity of complex 1. The addition of a preimmune antiserum did not affect any of the inducible complexes (Fig. 4 A). These results demonstrate that T-cell activation with PMA + Io induces the formation of NF-κB and NF-AT-containing complexes in the HIV-1 κB enhancer. To analyze whether HBx was able to synergize with cellular activation to induce the HIV-1 κB enhancer, Jurkat cells were transiently co-transfected with the plasmids pκBTK-Luc or pmκBTK-Luc (46Bachelerie F. Alcamı́ J. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Virelizier J.L. Nature. 1991; 350: 709-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), containing tandem copies of wt or mutated κB enhancer, along with pSV-HBx or pSV-hygro. The transfected cells were either left untreated or stimulated with PMA + Io. In addition, to determine the functional contribution of NF-AT in the activation of the κB enhancer, the plasmid pGFP-VIVIT (43Aramburu J. Yaffe M.B. López-Rodrı́guez C. Cantley L.C. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Science. 1999; 285: 2129-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar), encoding a specific NF-AT inhibitor, or the control vector pGFP were also included in the co-transfection experiments. As shown in Fig. 4 B, the transcriptional activity of pκBTK-Luc was induced about 72-fold by PMA + Io treatment. In addition, HBx expression in combination with PMA + Io further enhanced up to 438-fold the κB-mediated transcriptional activity. On the other hand, the plasmid pmκBTK-Luc, harboring tandem copies of the κB enhancer mutated in sequences involved in NF-κB binding but not in NF-AT binding, displayed a marked decrease in the response to PMA + Io treatment (10-fold). The expression of HBx in the presence of PMA + Io further increased up to 71-fold the transcriptional activity of this plasmid. In terms of fold induction over the effect of PMA + Io, HBx activated both constructs, pκBTK-Luc and pmκBTK-Luc, to a similar extent (6–7-fold). In the absence of PMA + Io, HBx expression only slightly induced the transcriptional activity of those plasmids (data not shown). Interestingly, the plasmid encoding the NF-AT inhibitor, pGFP-VIVIT, did not significantly affect the up-regulated transcriptional activity of the plasmid pκBTK-Luc. In contrast, the induction of pmκBTK-Luc by PMA + Io, either in the presence or the absence of HBx, was clearly prevented by the NF-AT inhibitor. The plasmids pKBF-Luc and pNF-AT-Luc, containing tandem copies of NF-κB- and NF-AT-responsive elements, respective"

Association of these changes with β cell hypertrophy, increased mRNA levels of the transcription factor c-Myc, and their complete normalization by phlorizin treatment suggested a link between chronic hyperglycemia, increased c-Myc expression, and altered β cell function. In this study, we tested the effect of hyperglycemia on rat pancreatic islet c-Myc expression both in vivo and in vitro. Elevation of plasma glucose for 1–4 days (glucose infusion/clamp) was followed by parallel increases in islet mRNA levels (relative to TATA-binding protein) of c-Myc and two of its target genes, ornithine decarboxylase and lactate dehydrogenase A. Similar changes were observed in vitro upon stimulation of cultured islets or purified β cells with 20 and 30 mmol·liter−1 glucose for 18 h. These effects of high glucose were reproduced by high potassium-induced depolarization or dibutyryl-cAMP and were inhibited by agents decreasing cytosolic Ca2+ or cAMP concentrations. In conclusion, the expression of the early response gene c-Myc in rat pancreatic β cells is stimulated by high glucose in a Ca2+-dependent manner and by cAMP. c-Myc could therefore participate to the regulation of β cell growth, apoptosis, and differentiation under physiological or pathophysiological conditions.

Lea & Febiger, Philadelphia, PA1994: 56-80Google Scholar), but how glucose exerts its other effects is unclear. Moreover, the influence of glucose is not always beneficial, because chronic hyperglycemia impairs β cell gene expression, function and survival (4Leahy J.L. LeRoith D. Taylor S.I. Olefsky J.M.

Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain this so called “glucose toxicity,” including β cell overstimulation, increased oxidative stress, protein glycation, and islet amyloid pancreatic polypeptide deposition. We have recently shown that 2–4 weeks after a 90% pancreatectomy, chronic hyperglycemia induces a loss of β cell differentiation that could account for the marked alteration of glucose-induced insulin secretion in this animal model of diabetes (7Jonas J.C.

Bumbalo L.M. Chen C. Diabetologia. 1993; 36: 1238-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Thus, the expression of several transcription factors involved in β cell differentiation (transcription factor Pdx1, hepatocyte nuclear factors, etc.) and of a panel of genes involved in glucose recognition and stimulation of secretion (insulin, glucose transporter 2, mitochondrial glycerol-P dehydrogenase, etc.) was decreased in islets from hyperglycemic 90% pancreatectomized rats. Conversely, the expression of two genes weakly expressed in normal β cells, hexokinase I and lactate dehydrogenase A (LDH-A),1 was increased. This loss of β cell differentiation was accompanied by an increase in β cell size and in the islet mRNA levels of c-Myc, an early response gene that can up-regulate LDH-A expression (9Shim H. Dolde C. Lewis B.C. Wu C.S. Dang G. Jungmann R.A. Dalla-Favera R. Dang C.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6658-6663Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). The complete reversal of these changes by 2 weeks of blood glucose normalization with phlorizin strongly suggested that hyperglycemia per se was their triggering factor (7Jonas J.C. Sharma A. Hasenkamp W. Ilkova H. Patane G. Laybutt R. Bonner-Weir S. Weir G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14112-14121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). c-Myc is a transcription factor of the basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper (bHLH-LZ) family that heterodimerizes with Max, another bHLH-LZ protein. The binding of Myc-Max heterodimers to E boxes (canonical consensus sequence CACGTG) activates the transcription of multiple genes implicated in the regulation of cell metabolism, protein synthesis, cell division, and apoptosis (10Dang C.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1395) Google Scholar). c-Myc can also repress the expression of a number of genes and decrease cell differentiation by unclear mechanisms. On the other hand, Max binds to bHLH-LZ factors of the Mad family, and Mad/Max heterodimers can antagonize the effects of Myc/Max by a mechanism involving recruitment of histone deacetylase and prevention of gene transcriptional activation. Constitutive c-Myc expression because of gene activation is the cause of many human cancers, including lung carcinomas and Burkitt's lymphomas (10Dang C.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1395) Google Scholar). In differentiated cells, including fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, and hepatocytes, c-Myc overexpression stimulates cell growth and proliferation, decreases cell differentiation, and sensitizes cells to apoptosis (11Pelengaris S. Rudolph B. Littlewood T. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 100-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 12Schmidt E.V.

Physiol. 1998; 60: 575-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Interestingly, these effects resemble those observed in β cells chronically exposed to hyperglycemia (loss of differentiation, proliferation, and/or hypertrophy depending on the model, apoptosis), which suggests that an increase in c-Myc expression could play a role in the deleterious effects of chronic hyperglycemia on pancreatic β cells. However, little is known about the regulation of c-Myc expression by glucose in pancreatic β cells (15Yamashita S. Tobinaga T. Ashizawa K. Nagayama Y. Yokota A. Harakawa S. Inoue S. Hirayu H. Izumi M. Nagataki S. Endocrinology. 1988; 123: 1825-1829Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether and how glucose regulates β cell c-Myc expression by measuring changes in the mRNA levels of c-Myc, Max, Mad1, and some of the putative Myc/Max target genes, ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), thymidine kinase (TK), LDH-A, and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) (10Dang C.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1395) Google Scholar, 16Cole M.D. McMahon S.B. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2916-2924Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 17Hermeking H. Rago C.

A. 2000; 97: 2229-2234Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). The study was carried out with both in vivo and in vitromodels of hyperglycemia. The effect of hyperglycemia on c-Myc expression was investigated in islets isolated from glucose-infused rats (in vivohyperglycemia) and in islets or purified β cells isolated from untreated rats and cultured at various glucose concentrations (in vitro hyperglycemia). The rats were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 100 mg·kg−1 pentobarbital (60 mg·ml−1 nembutal; Abbott Laboratories), and their pancreatic islets were isolated by collagenase digestion of the gland as described previously (7Jonas J.C. Sharma A. Hasenkamp W. Ilkova H. Patane G. Laybutt R. Bonner-Weir S. Weir G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14112-14121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). They were then separated from the digest by density gradient centrifugation using Histopaque 1077, microdissected, and hand picked under a stereomicroscope to ensure high purity of the preparation. Male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (∼250 g) with indwelling jugular vein and carotid artery catheters were obtained from Taconic Farms (Germantown, NY). Following arrival at the animal facility, the rats were observed for at least 3 days to ensure general well being as assessed by weight gain and appearance. The rats were randomly assigned to a glucose-infused group (500 g·liter−1 hydrated glucose; McGaw, Irvine CA), a saline-infused group (4.5 g·liter−1 NaCl) or a noninfused, nonrestrained group (control). Infusions were performed in the carotid artery at a rate of 2 ml·h−1 for 24 h beginning at ∼9:30 a.m. The infusion system consisted of a swivel and saddle (Lomir Biomedical Inc., Malone, NY) designed to allow the rat unrestricted mobility. Blood samples (∼0.1 ml) were drawn from the jugular vein at −1, −0.5 (prior to infusion), 0.1, 0.5, 1, 6, 12, and 24 h, placed in heparin-coated tubes, and immediately centrifuged. A portion of the supernatant (10 μl) was immediately used for plasma glucose determination (Beckman Glucose Analyzer II; Beckman, Brea, CA), and the remainder (∼40 μl) was stored at −20 °C for later determination of plasma insulin concentration. The rats were allowedad libitum food and water during infusion, and a standard light cycle (12 h of light, 12 h of dark) was maintained. At the end of the infusion period, the islets were isolated and processed for RT-PCR measurement of gene mRNA levels. When in vivo hyperglycemia was extended up to 96 h, the rate of glucose infusion was regularly adjusted to keep plasma glucose close to 11 mmol·liter−1. The rate of saline infusion was changed accordingly. At the end of the experiment, islets were isolated and processed for RT-PCR measurement of gene mRNA levels. The islets isolated from untreated male Wistar rats were cultured at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10–30 mmol·liter−1 glucose, 5 g·liter−1 bovine serum albumin (BSA), 100 IU·ml−1 penicillin, and 100 μg·ml−1 streptomycin in the presence of 5% CO2. In most cases, the islets from one pancreas (∼500–1000) were precultured in 9 ml of RPMI-G10 medium for 1 week, during which the medium was renewed after 1 day and then every other day. Large islets (diameter, >200 μm) with signs of central necrosis were discarded. After this week of preculture, the islets were cultured overnight (18 h) in batches of 45–60 in 1.5 ml of RPMI medium containing 5–30 mmol·liter−1 glucose and various test substances. At the end of these 18 h of culture, a portion of the medium was withdrawn for insulin secretion measurement, and the islets were processed for RT-PCR measurement of gene mRNA levels. After 1 week of preculture in RPMI-G10 medium, the islets were cultured 18 h in the presence of G10 or G30. Each group was then divided in batches of 45–60 islets, further incubated for 0, 20, 40, 80, and 120 min in the same medium supplemented with 5 μg/ml actinomycin D, and processed for RT-PCR measurement of gene mRNA levels. The islets isolated from untreated male Wistar rats were dissociated in single cells. The β cells were purified by autofluorescence-activated cell sorting, reaggregated, and cultured for 3 days in Ham's F-10 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing G10, 5 g·liter−1 BSA, 2 mmol·liter−1 glutamine, 50 μmol·liter−1 isobutylmethylxanthine, and antibiotics as described (1Ling Z.

Then, reaggregated β cells were cultured overnight in a similar medium containing 10–30 mmol·liter−1 glucose before their total RNA was extracted and processed for RT-PCR determination of gene mRNA levels. Islet total RNA was extracted, quantified, and reverse transcribed into cDNA exactly as described (7Jonas J.C. Sharma A. Hasenkamp W. Ilkova H. Patane G. Laybutt R. Bonner-Weir S. Weir G.C. J. Biol.

Control reactions lacking the reverse transcriptase were run in parallel.

Open table in a new tab Polymerization reactions were performed with a PerkinElmer 9700 Thermocycler in a 25-μl reaction volume containing 1.5–3 μl of cDNA (10–20-ng RNA equivalents), 80 μm cold dNTPs, 1.25 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci·mmol−1), 1.25–15 pmol of appropriate oligonucleotide primers, GeneAmp Gold PCR buffer, and 1.25 units of AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The cycling conditions (Table I) were chosen to be in the exponential phase of amplification of each product in control islet cDNA (Fig. 1), as described previously (7Jonas J.C. Sharma A. Hasenkamp W. Ilkova H. Patane G. Laybutt R. Bonner-Weir S. Weir G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14112-14121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). The thermal cycle profile was a 10-min denaturing step at 94 °C to release DNA polymerase activity followed by the amplification cycles (1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at the annealing temperature and 1 min at 72 °C, unless otherwise specified in TableI), and a final extension step of 10 min at 72 °C. In each set, the gene products of interest were amplified with an internal control gene (TATA box-binding protein (TBP)) to correct for experimental variations between samples (TBP mRNA levels remained constant under the different experimental conditions). The amplimers were then separated on a 6% polyacrylamide gel in Tris borate EDTA buffer, in parallel with a 100-base pair DNA ladder. The gel was dried, and the amount of [α-32P]dCTP incorporated in each amplimer was quantitated with a Cyclone Storage Phosphor System (Packard, Meriden, CT). The ratio of specific product/control gene was then calculated for each sample. Quintuplicate RT-PCR determination of the c-Myc/TBP ratio from the same RNA preparation gave a within-assay coefficient of variation of 5.5%. The size of amplicons corresponded to the expected ones (published sequences), except for ODC that migrated at ∼340 base pairs instead of 297 base pairs in PAGE. However, its size was correct in agarose gel electrophoresis, and its sequence (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium) corresponded to the published sequence of rat ODC (GenBankTM accession number J04792). Equal batches of islets (∼500) were cultured 18 h under various conditions, washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (100 g·liter−1). After double ether extraction, the pellet was dried and solubilized in modified Laemmli buffer (0.5 g·liter−1 SDS, 1:10 (v/v) glycerol, 1:40 (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 62.5 mmol·liter−1 Tris, pH 6.8, and 50 mg·liter−1 bromphenol blue). Total islet proteins were then separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). After Ponceau S staining to check transfer efficiency, the membrane was blocked for 2 h at room temperature with 10% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing 0.05% Tween-20 (NFDM-TBST). It was then incubated overnight at 4 °C in NFDM-TBST containing 2 μg/ml anti-c-Myc (N-262) polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), washed with TBST, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (0.1 μg/ml NFDM-TBS). After six washes with TBST, detection of bound antibodies was carried out with the Supersignal West Femto kit (Pierce) using Kodak X-AR films. Insulin concentrations in the plasma and culture media were determined by radioimmunoassay using rat insulin as standard. The results are presented as the means ± S.E. for the indicated number of animals or batches of islets. Statistical significance of differences between groups was assessed by unpaired Student's t test or by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by a test of Newman-Keuls when more than two groups were compared. For mRNA half-life determination, mathematical analysis of the data was done using Prism 3.02 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). The effect of glucose on islet c-Myc mRNA levels was tested in an in vivo model of hyperglycemia associated with β cell hypertrophy and impaired secretory function, the 50% glucose-infused rat (18Bonner-Weir S.

During saline infusion, plasma glucose and insulin concentrations remained stable at ∼5.5 mmol·liter−1 and ∼1 ng·ml−1, respectively. In contrast, glucose infusion was followed by large increases in plasma glucose and insulin concentrations up to ∼20 mmol·liter−1 and ∼15 ng·ml−1, respectively (Fig. 2 A). Compared with control, noninfused or saline-infused rats, glucose-infused rats had an approximately 2-fold increase in islet c-Myc/TBP ratio without significant differences in Max1, Max2, and Mad1/TBP ratios (Table II). An approximately 2-fold increase in the mRNA levels of two c-Myc target genes, ODC, and LDH-A was observed, but two other putative c-Myc target genes, TK and CDK4, remained unaffected by glucose infusion (Table II).Table IIInfluence of hyperglycemia on islet mRNA levels of c-Myc and c-Myc target genesProtocol24-h glucose infusion96-h glucose clampGroupsControlSaline2-aMean of 2, not included in statistical analysis.GlucoseSalineGlucosen = 5n = 2n = 5n = 4n = 6c-Myc network c-Myc100 ± 2074195 ± 242-bp < 0.01 versusnoninfused control group by unpaired t test.100 ± 13191 ± 272-cp < 0.05 versussaline-infused group by unpaired t test.

The results are the means ± S.E. for the indicated number of animals. When glucose was infused for 4 days at a constant flow rate, plasma glucose concentrations gradually returned to normal values, whereas a sustained increase in plasma insulin levels was observed (18Bonner-Weir S. Deery D. Leahy J.L. Weir G.C. Diabetes. 1989; 38: 49-53Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (not shown). At the end of that period, the islet c-Myc/TBP ratio was not different from that in control or saline-infused rat islets (n = 2; not shown). In contrast, when plasma glucose was maintained elevated at ∼11 mmol·liter−1 for 4 days by regularly adjusting the rate of glucose infusion (Fig.2 B), islet c-Myc/TBP ratio was increased ∼2fold compared with islets from matched saline-infused rats. There was a parallel rise in the ODC/TBP ratio but no change in Max1, Max2, Mad1, TK, or CDK4 mRNA levels (Table II). The islets were cultured for 1 week in RPMI medium containing G10 or G30. Insulin secretion decreased by ∼50% at both glucose concentrations over the first 3 days (p < 0.0001 for time effect by two-way ANOVA) but was consistently larger in the presence of G30versus G10 (p < 0.0001 for glucose effect by two-way ANOVA), indicating good β cell viability (Fig.3 A). The c-Myc/TBP mRNA ratio was low (0.7 ± 0.2,n = 4) in freshly isolated islets. After 18 h of culture in 10–30 mmol·liter−1 glucose, a glucose-dependent increase in c-Myc/TBP was observed, followed by a progressive and complete normalization after 1 week of culture (p < 0.05 for glucose effect andp < 0.01 for time effect by two-way ANOVA) (Fig.3 B). The large increase in c-Myc mRNA levels induced by 18 h of culture in G30 was accompanied by an increase in c-Myc protein of the islets (Fig. 4). This early and transient rise in c-Myc/TBP ratio was also observed when islets were isolated without the use of Histopaque 1077 and was independent of the presence of fetal calf serum or BSA in the culture medium (not shown). In a single short term culture in the presence of G30, the rise was observed after 30–60 min and became progressively larger during the next 18 h (not shown). Because this early rise could be due to the stress of islet isolation (20Paraskevas S. Aikin R. Maysinger D. Lakey J.R. Cavanagh T.J. Hering B. Wang R. Rosenberg L. FEBS Lett. 1999; 455: 203-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), all subsequent experiments were performed after 1 week of preculture in the presence of G10. The islet c-Myc/TBP ratio was low in islets precultured in G10 for 1 week (0.48 ± 0.07,n = 5). It did not change after a further 18 h of culture when the glucose concentration remained at 10 mmol·liter−1 (0.52 ± 0.09, n = 13) but increased ∼5-fold in the presence of G30 (2.51 ± 0.36,n = 13, p < 0.0001 by unpairedt test). In a subset of five experiments in which the intermediate glucose concentration of 20 mmol·liter−1was also tested, a clear concentration-dependent effect of glucose on insulin release and islet c-Myc mRNA levels was observed (Fig. 5). Under these conditions, c-Myc mRNA half-life was short and unaffected by glucose (35 ± 4 and 25 ± 1 min in the presence of G10 and G30 respectively,n = 3, no significant difference by unpairedt test) (Fig. 6). Similar toin vivo hyperglycemic conditions, the glucose-dependent rise in the c-Myc/TBP mRNA ratioin vitro was accompanied by parallel changes in c-Myc target genes ODC and LDH-A/TBP mRNA ratios, without changes in Max, Mad1, TK, or CDK4 mRNA levels (Fig. 5). To ascertain that the induction of c-Myc mRNA levels by high glucose occurred in β cells within the islets, β cells were purified, reaggregated, precultured for 3 days in the presence of G10, and further cultured 18 h in the presence of G10 or G30. Compared with β cells kept in G10, the normalized c-Myc/TBP ratio increased from 1.0 ± 0.06 to 1.81 ± 0.18 in the presence of G30 (p < 0.01,n = 4).Figure 6Effect of glucose on c-Myc mRNA half-life. A, after 1 week of preculture in G10, islets were cultured 18 h in the presence of G10 or G30. Batches of 40–60 islets were then cultured in the same medium supplemented with 5 μg·ml−1 actinomycin D for the time indicated. Their total RNA was extracted, and c-Myc, TBP, and cyclophilin mRNA levels were determined by RT-PCR. At time 0, c-Myc/TBP mRNA ratio was increased 5.7 ± 1.9-fold in G30 versus G10 (n = 3). B, band intensities were expressed as percentages of the maximal intensity, and, except for cyclophilin, which did not decrease within 2 h, the data were fitted to a one-phase exponential decay equation (Y = Span *e(−K*X) + Plateau, where Span and plateau are fixed at 100 and 0%, respectively, and half-life = 0.69/K). The data are the means ± S.E. for three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) When the extracellular glucose concentration increases, islet glycolysis and mitochondrial metabolism are stimulated.

https://openalex.org/W2051422041,"Persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy (PHHI) is a genetic disorder characterized by excess secretion of insulin and hypoglycemia. In most patients, the disease is caused by mutations in sulfonylurea receptor-1 (SUR1), which, in association with Kir6.2, constitutes the functional ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channel of the pancreatic β-cell. Previous studies reported that coexpression of the PHHI mutant R1394H-SUR1 with Kir6.2 in COS cells produces no functional channels. To investigate if the loss of function could be due to impaired trafficking of mutant channels to the cell membrane, we have cotransfected wild-type and mutant SUR1 subunits with Kir6.2 into HEK293 cells and examined their cellular localization by immunofluorescent staining. Our results show that unlike the wild-type subunits, which showed fluorescence at the cell surface, the mutant subunits displayed fluorescence in punctate structures. Co-immunostaining with antibodies against organelle-specific marker proteins identified these structures as thetrans-Golgi network. Limited localization in clathrin-positive, but transferrin receptor-negative vesicles was also observed. The post-endoplasmic reticulum localization suggests that the mutation does not impair the folding and assembly of the channels so as to cause its retention by the endoplasmic reticulum. Diazoxide, a KATP channel opener drug that is used in the treatment of PHHI, restored the surface expression in a manner that could be prevented by the channel blocker glibenclamide. When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, R1394H-SUR1 formed functional channels with Kir6.2, indicating that the primary consequence of the mutation is impairment of trafficking rather than function. Thus, our data uncover a novel mechanism underlying the therapeutic action of diazoxide in the treatment of PHHI, i.e. its ability to recruit channels to the membrane.

In normal individuals, a rise in the blood glucose levels is accompanied by an increase in the uptake and metabolism of glucose by the β-cells, leading to increased production of ATP. The resultant elevation of intracellular [ATP]/[ADP] closes KATP channels, leading to membrane depolarization and activation of voltage-gated calcium channels. As a result, the intracellular calcium levels increase, triggering exocytotic secretion of insulin (7Ashcroft F.M. Gribble F.M. Diabetologia. 1999; 42: 903-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar).Our understanding of the mechanism by which nucleotides regulate the KATP channels has improved with the cloning and heterologous expression of these channels (8Inagaki N.

The pancreatic β-cell KATP channel is an octamer consisting of four Kir6.2 and four sulfonylurea receptor-1 (SUR1) subunits (9Clement J.P. Kunjilwar K. Gonzalez G. Schwanstecher M. Panten U.

Kir6.2 is a member of the inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir) channel family, which forms the potassium-conducting pore of the channel (12Tucker S.J. Gribble F.M. Zhao C. Trapp S. Ashcroft F.M. Nature. 1997; 387: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). SUR1 is a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily (13Schneider E. Hunke S. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1998; 22: 1-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); it contains two nucleotide-binding folds, NBF1 and NBF2, with which it senses changes in intracellular [ATP]/[ADP] and transmits the signal to the pore. NBF1 appears to be the principal site for ATP binding, whereas NBF2 binds Mg-ADP. These binding domains cooperate with each other in mediating the nucleotide regulation of the pore function (14Matsuo M. Kioka N. Amachi T. Ueda K. J. Biol.

The sulfonylurea drugs (glibenclamide and tolbutamide) inhibit the channels and are used in the treatment of non-insulin-dependent (type II) diabetes mellitus. The other class of drugs, known as potassium channel opener drugs (e.g. diazoxide), activate the channel and are used to suppress insulin secretion.Kir6.2, unlike many other Kir channels, cannot form functional channels at the plasma membrane when expressed in the absence of SUR1 (8Inagaki N. Gonoi T. Clement J.P. Namba N. Inazawa J. Gonzalez G. Aguilar-Bryan L. Seino S. Bryan J. Science. 1995; 270: 1166-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1605) Google Scholar). This was shown to be due to the presence of a novel endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention signal (RXR) in the C-terminal end of the subunit (17Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). SUR1, like Kir6.2, also contains an ER retention signal and fails to traffic to the cell surface when expressed alone. When coexpressed, however, the subunits are thought to mask each other's ER retention signals, resulting in the release of the complex from the ER and the appearance of the channel at the cell surface. Removal of the C-terminal 36 amino acids containing the ER retention signal allows Kir6.2 to form functional channels at the cell surface (12Tucker S.J. Gribble F.M. Zhao C. Trapp S. Ashcroft F.M. Nature. 1997; 387: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar).

Functional analyses of these mutations in COS cells revealed two types of phenotypic change: some mutations abolish channel function, and others reduce the response to changes in the intracellular [ATP]/[ADP] ratio (4Nichols C.G.

(20Cartier E.A. Conti L.R. Vandenberg C.A. Shyng S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2882-2887Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) that the ΔF1388 mutation in SUR1 causes retention of the mutant channel in the ER. In that work, the authors showed that removal of the RKR retention signal partially overcomes the effect of the mutation. Here, we have investigated the effect of one nonfunctional PHHI mutation, R1394H, on trafficking of the channel. We show that HEK293 cells stably transfected with R1394H-SUR1 and Kir6.2 present no surface expression for either of the subunits; instead, they are retained mainly in thetrans-Golgi network (TGN). In addition, pretreatment with diazoxide alone, but not combined with glibenclamide, reverses the defect, thereby rescuing the cell-surface expression. And finally, the Kir6.2·R1394H-SUR1 mutant channel complex is functional inXenopus oocytes. Taken together, our data demonstrate that the R1394H mutation does not impair the channel function, but prevents its surface expression through retention in the TGN.DISCUSSIONPrevious studies have shown that the PHHI mutant R1394H-SUR1, when coexpressed with Kir6.2 in mammalian cell lines, does not produce functional channels (4Nichols C.G. Shyng S.L. Nestorowicz A. Glaser B. Clement J.P. Gonzalez G. Aguilar-Bryan L. Permutt M.A. Bryan J. Science. 1996; 272: 1785-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 5Shyng S.L. Ferrigni T. Shepard J.B. Nestorowicz A. Glaser B. Permutt M.A. Nichols C.G. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1145-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that this is because the subunits fail to reach the cell surface (Fig. 1), as they are retained by the TGN (Fig. 2). This contrasts with the previous studies, which showed that mutations that cause trafficking defects, in almost all cases, lead to misfolding and retention of misfolded proteins in the ER (27Sanders C.R. Nagy J.K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 438-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Examples include ΔF508 CFTR (34Cheng S.H. Gregory R.J. Marshall J. Paul S. Souza D.W. White G.A. O'Riordan C.R. Smith A.E. Cell. 1990; 63: 827-834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1405) Google Scholar), the N470D HERG potassium channel (29Zhou Z. Gong Q. January C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31123-31126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), the vasopressin V2 receptor (30Morello J.P. Petaja-Repo U.E. Bichet D.G. Bouvier M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 466-469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), and the more recently reported Kir6.2·ΔF1388-SUR1 channel complex (20Cartier E.A. Conti L.R. Vandenberg C.A. Shyng S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2882-2887Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In these situations, the quality control machinery of the ER ensures that the misfolded proteins are degraded by diverting them to proteasomes or lysosomes (27Sanders C.R. Nagy J.K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 438-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 35Meacham G.C. Patterson C. Zhang W. Younger J.M. Cyr D.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 100-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). The R1394H mutation of SUR1 thus appears to be different from all other cases reported so far and is, to our knowledge, the first genetic mutation to cause retention of membrane protein in a post-ER compartment.The R1394H mutation does not appear to impair the folding and assembly of the channel to the extent that it would necessitate retention by the quality control mechanism of the ER. Zerangue et al. (17Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar) showed that the wild-type SUR1 and Kir6.2 subunits, when expressed independently, are retained in the ER because they both contain the retention signal RKR. When coexpressed, however, the subunits assemble and mask each other's retention signals, as a result of which the channel is released by the quality control system of the ER. The finding that R1394H-SUR1 and Kir6.2 subunits were not retained in the ER suggests that the mutation does not impair the ability of SUR1 to assemble with Kir6.2. This is further supported by the fact that when coexpressed in Xenopus oocytes, the mutant SUR1 forms functional channels with Kir6.2 at the plasma membrane of the cell (Fig. 5).The mechanisms by which proteins are sorted into specific membrane compartments are not fully understood (27Sanders C.R. Nagy J.K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 438-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Properly folded and assembled proteins exit the ER and enter the TGN, where they are sorted into appropriate transport vesicles, which direct them to their normal destination. Proteins destined for the plasma membrane, for example, segregate into secretory vesicles, which carry them to the plasma membrane via the secretory pathway (26Kirchhausen T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 699-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). However, some membrane proteins appear to use a nonsecretory pathway to reach the cell surface (36Leitinger B. Hille-Rehfeld A. Spiess M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10109-10113Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 37Futter C.E. Connolly C.N. Cutler D.F. Hopkins C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10999-11003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). These proteins are packaged into AP-1 adapter-containing clathrin-coated vesicles at the TGN. Although the major function of these vesicles is to direct proteins to lysosomes via late endosomes, some vesicles, after shedding their clathrin coats, appear to carry the cargo proteins to the plasma membrane. Some plasma membrane proteins such as the transferrin receptor and the low density lipoprotein receptor, which recycle between the plasma membrane and intracellular compartments, also employ clathrin-coated vesicles, but use a different adapter protein, AP-2 (26Kirchhausen T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 699-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). To identify at which point during these transport events the Kir6.2·R1394H-SUR1 mutant channel complex is retained, we used antibodies specific to individual compartments. The resulting data (Fig. 2) showed that the mutant channel is mainly retained in the TGN. Limited, but notable amounts of the mutant protein were also found in clathrin-positive vesicles. These findings suggest that mutant channels are stranded in the TGN. However, a small proportion of these appear to leave the TGN in the form of clathrin-coated vesicles; these vesicles may direct the mutant protein either to endosomes/lysosomes or to the plasma membrane. However, the absence of co-localization with the transferrin receptor (Fig. 2) suggests that, after leaving the TGN, the mutant channels are unlikely to reach the plasma membrane and undergo endocytosis. Instead, the clathrin-coated vesicles may deliver the mutant protein to lysosomes.Arg1394 in native SUR1 is just downstream of the Walker A motif of NBF2. An examination of the amino acid sequences of ABC subfamilies (A–G) revealed that this arginine is conserved in NBF2 of most members of the ABC-B (MDR) and ABC-C (MRP) subfamilies, but not in any of the other subfamilies. Key members of these two subfamilies include P-glycoprotein, CFTR, and SUR1. Although NBF1 shows significant sequence identity to NBF2, the residue corresponding to position 1394 is not an arginine in NBF1. Commensurate with this, homology modeling of NBF2 with the crystal structures of the ATP-binding subunit of histidine permease (38Hung L.W. Wang I.X. Nikaido K. Liu P.Q. Ames G.F. Kim S.H. Nature. 1998; 396: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar) and RAD50c, a protein involved in DNA repair (39Hopfner K.P. Karcher A. Shin D.S. Craig L. Arthur L.M. Carney J.P. Tainer J.A. Cell. 2000; 101: 789-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar), revealed that residues at this position do not participate in ATP binding. The fact that Arg1394 is conserved among the members of only some subfamilies, including SUR1, raises the possibility that this residue may play a role that is unique to these members; one possibility is that it regulates membrane trafficking.A variety of approaches have been employed to correct trafficking defects. These include reduction of growth temperature (28Aizawa T. Komatsu M. Asanuma N. Sato Y. Sharp G.W. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1998; 19: 496-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar,29Zhou Z. Gong Q. January C.T. J. Biol.

Reduction of temperature, which has been successfully used to improve folding in the ER and hence the surface expression of ΔF508 CFTR (28Aizawa T. Komatsu M. Asanuma N. Sato Y. Sharp G.W. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1998; 19: 496-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and the N470D HERG potassium channel (29Zhou Z. Gong Q. January C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31123-31126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), has no effect on Kir6.2·R1394H-SUR1 (Fig. 3). This was not unexpected because, as noted above, the R1394H mutation does not appear to affect the folding and assembly of KATP channels to the extent that it would necessitate retention by the quality control machinery of the ER.There are several examples in the literature where trafficking defects have been corrected by treating the cells with ligands specific to the protein (30Morello J.P. Petaja-Repo U.E. Bichet D.G. Bouvier M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 466-469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Application of diazoxide, a KATPchannel opener drug and a drug used in the treatment of PHHI, has fully restored the surface expression of Kir6.2·R1394H-SUR1; glibenclamide prevented the rescuing effect of diazoxide (Fig. 4). However, the mechanism by which diazoxide restores membrane expression of the mutant is unclear. Since the function of diazoxide seems to be to stabilize the activated state of the channel (presumably the Mg2+-ADP-bound form), we speculate that it is in the activated conformation that KATP channels traffic to the membrane. The ability of glibenclamide, a drug that stabilizes the inactive from of the channel, to antagonize the action of diazoxide is consistent with this argument.The therapeutic basis for the treatment of PHHI patients with diazoxide has thus far been thought to be associated with its ability to activate KATP channels already present in the plasma membrane. However, the present finding that diazoxide can promote membrane trafficking of PHHI mutant channels uncovers a new molecular basis for the therapeutic action of diazoxide, i.e. its ability to recruit channels to the plasma membrane.In summary, we have shown that the R1394H mutation does not abolish channel function once at the plasma membrane, but causes retention of the channel complex in the TGN. The demonstration that diazoxide, a drug used to treat PHHI, is able to mobilize the mutant channel complex to the membrane provides a new molecular basis for the therapeutic action of this drug. Finally, the finding that the Kir6.2·R1394H-SUR1 mutant channel complex is retained in a post-ER compartment represents a new cellular mechanism by which genetic mutations can cause trafficking defects. Persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy (PHHI),1 also known as familial hyperinsulinism, is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by excess secretion of insulin, leading to hypoglycemia (1Permutt M.A. Nestorowicz A.

In normal individuals, a rise in the blood glucose levels is accompanied by an increase in the uptake and metabolism of glucose by the β-cells, leading to increased production of ATP. The resultant elevation of intracellular [ATP]/[ADP] closes KATP channels, leading to membrane depolarization and activation of voltage-gated calcium channels. As a result, the intracellular calcium levels increase, triggering exocytotic secretion of insulin (7Ashcroft F.M. Gribble F.M. Diabetologia. 1999; 42: 903-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Our understanding of the mechanism by which nucleotides regulate the KATP channels has improved with the cloning and heterologous expression of these channels (8Inagaki N. Gonoi T. Clement J.P.

The pancreatic β-cell KATP channel is an octamer consisting of four Kir6.2 and four sulfonylurea receptor-1 (SUR1) subunits (9Clement J.P. Kunjilwar K. Gonzalez G. Schwanstecher M. Panten U.

Kir6.2 is a member of the inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir) channel family, which forms the potassium-conducting pore of the channel (12Tucker S.J. Gribble F.M. Zhao C. Trapp S. Ashcroft F.M. Nature. 1997; 387: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). SUR1 is a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily (13Schneider E. Hunke S. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1998; 22: 1-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); it contains two nucleotide-binding folds, NBF1 and NBF2, with which it senses changes in intracellular [ATP]/[ADP] and transmits the signal to the pore. NBF1 appears to be the principal site for ATP binding, whereas NBF2 binds Mg-ADP. These binding domains cooperate with each other in mediating the nucleotide regulation of the pore function (14Matsuo M. Kioka N. Amachi T. Ueda K. J. Biol.

To clarify further the function of this activity, we have examined adenine nucleotide effects on interactions ofEscherichia coli MutS with homoduplex and heteroduplex DNAs. In contrast to previous results with human MutSα, we find that a physical block at one end of a linear heteroduplex is sufficient to support stable MutS complex formation in the presence of ATP·Mg2+. Surface plasmon resonance analysis at low ionic strength indicates that the lifetime of MutS complexes with heteroduplex DNA depends on the nature of the nucleotide present when MutS binds. Whereas complexes prepared in the absence of nucleotide or in the presence of ADP undergo rapid dissociation upon challenge with ATP·Mg2+, complexes produced in the presence of ATP·Mg2+, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate (AMPPNP)·Mg2+, or ATP (no Mg2+) are resistant to dissociation upon ATP challenge. AMPPNP·Mg2+ and ATP (no Mg2+) reduce MutS affinity for heteroduplex but have little effect on homoduplex affinity, resulting in abolition of specificity for mispaired DNA at physiological salt concentrations. Conversely, the highest mismatch specificity is observed in the absence of nucleotide or in the presence of ADP.

Rectification of DNA biosynthetic errors by these systems relies on secondary signals within the helix that serve to distinguish newly synthesized DNA from the template strand. In Escherichia coli these signals are based on patterns of adenine methylation of d(GATC) sequences, which are hemimethylated in newly replicated DNA (2Meselson M. Low K.B. Recombination of the Genetic Material. Academic Press, San Diego1988: 91-113Google Scholar). Repair is initiated via mismatch recognition by MutS, with assembly of a MutL·MutS·heteroduplex complex serving to activate the MutH d(GATC) endonuclease in an ATP-dependent reaction (9Su S.-S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5057-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 10Grilley M. Welsh K.M. Su S.-S. Modrich P. J. Biol.

Activated MutH cleaves the unmethylated strand of a hemimodified d(GATC) sequence that may be located to either side of the mispair. Assembly of MutL·MutS·heteroduplex is also sufficient to activate unwinding by DNA helicase II, which enters the helix at the MutH-produced strand break with an orientation bias such that it tracks back toward the mismatch (12Dao V. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9202-9207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). This orientation-dependent activation of the excision system at the strand break implies signaling between the two DNA sites along the helix contour. The fact that MutS and MutL are sufficient for this effect suggests that one or both of these activities function in signal transmission between the two DNA sites. Several models have been proposed to account for interaction of the two DNA sites involved in the methyl-directed reaction. The recent demonstration that a mismatch within one oligonucleotide duplex can activate MutS- and MutL-dependent MutH cleavage of a d(GATC) sequence on a second oligonucleotide duplex has led to the suggestion that the two sites are brought into proximity by DNA bending with the presence of MutS at the mispair signaling activation of downstream activities at the strand signal via a MutL interface (13Junop M.S. Obmolova G. Rausch K. Hsieh P. Yang W. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). However, the efficiency MutH activation reported in these trans-activation experiments is several hundred times lower than that observed for d(GATC) cleavage activated in cis by a mismatch located 1,000 base pairs distant (11Au K.G.

Furthermore, whereas a DNA bending mechanism might account for activation of MutH cleavage at a d(GATC) sequence, it does not explain the MutS-, MutL-, and orientation-dependent activation of the excision system at the ensuing strand break. Two alternate models, which can account for orientation-dependent signaling between the two DNA sites, invoke ATP-dependent movement of MutS and its eukaryotic homologs along the helix contour (14Allen D.J.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2677-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), this effect may be due at least in part to binding of the triphosphate, although ATP hydrolysis by the heteroduplex-bound protein has been invoked by several laboratories (14Allen D.J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 2080-2086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Electron microscopic analysis of the kinetics of evolution of MutS·heteroduplex complexes has indicated that the presence of ATP results in the nucleotide-dependent formation of DNA loops, which grow with time and are stabilized by bound MutS at the base (14Allen D.J. Makhov A. Grilley M. Taylor J. Thresher R. Modrich P. Griffith J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4467-4476Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). However, loop formation was not supported by ATPγS,1 and ongoing ATP-dependent DNA loop growth was blocked upon addition of excess AMPPNP. Since the mismatch was found within the DNA loop with most heteroduplexes, these effects were attributed to ATP-dependent tracking of MutS from the mispair in a bidirectional fashion. Analysis of ATP effects on the interaction of human MutSα with linear heteroduplexes that have biotin-avidin end-blocks or with circular DNAs has indicated that the MSH2·hMSH6 heterodimer also leaves a mispair in the presence of ATP by movement along the helix (15Blackwell L.J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 2080-2086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This has led to the suggestion that in the presence of ATP, MutS homologs form a sliding clamp about the helix (15Blackwell L.J. Martik D. Bjornson K.P. Bjornson E.S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32055-32062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 16Gradia S. Subramanian D. Wilson T. Acharya S. Makhov A. Griffith J. Fishel R. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 255-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). However, two distinct mechanisms for movement of this clamp have been proposed. One model invokes ATP binding and hydrolysis by DNA-bound hMutSα to modulate protein conformers leading to directional movement of a sliding clamp along the helix (15Blackwell L.J. Martik D. Bjornson K.P. Bjornson E.S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32055-32062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The other posits mismatch recognition by the hMutSα·ADP complex, with the mispair acting as a nucleotide exchange factor that promotes formation of the hMutSα·ATP complex that is capable of free diffusion along the helix (16Gradia S. Subramanian D. Wilson T. Acharya S. Makhov A. Griffith J. Fishel R. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 255-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). In this mechanism ATP hydrolysis occurs after release from DNA and serves to regenerate the mismatch-binding form of the protein. These models differ with respect to an ADP requirement for mismatch recognition, whether movement on DNA is directional and whether ATP hydrolysis is supported by the DNA-bound form of the protein. As noted above, the substantial evidence supporting ATP-dependent movement of MutS homologs along the helix has been interpreted in terms of a mechanism for signaling between the mismatch and the strand signal that directs repair. However, it is important to note that other potential functional roles for movement of the protein along the helix have not been excluded, for example, involvement in the kinetic path by which mispairs are located. A distinct function for ATP binding and hydrolysis by MutS homologs has been suggested in the context of the DNA bending model for interaction of the mismatch and strand signal sites that was described above. This proposal stipulates that once mismatch recognition occurs, MutS remains bound to the mispair during the course of the repair reaction. In this scheme, ATP binding and hydrolysis by DNA-bound MutS functions in a kinetic proofreading mechanism that is used to verify mismatch recognition prior to initiation of repair (13Junop M.S. Obmolova G. Rausch K. Hsieh P. Yang W. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). ATP binding by DNA-bound MutS is envisioned to reduce the affinity of the protein for both mismatches and homoduplex sites. The ATP-induced reduction in affinity is postulated to be greater for the MutS·homoduplex complex than for the MutS·mismatch complex, resulting in preferential dissociation of MutS from correctly paired sequences. This paper addresses the effects of adenine nucleotides on the interaction of MutS with heteroduplex and homoduplex DNAs. We show that as in the case of human MutSα, ATP-promoted dissociation of a MutS·heteroduplex complex requires free DNA ends. Interestingly, a single avidin-biotin end-block is sufficient to prevent dissociation, implying that this protein does not form a simple sliding clamp in the presence of ATP that is capable of free diffusion along a heteroduplex. By using surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy, we also show that MutS is capable of specific mismatch recognition in the presence of ADP, ATP·Mg2+, or in the absence of nucleotide, although mismatch specificity is not detectable at physiological ionic strength in the presence of AMPPNP·Mg2+ or in the presence of ATP in the absence of a divalent cation. These observations indicate that adenine nucleotides differentially modulate mismatch and homoduplex interactions and indicate that the protein has two distinct DNA-binding modes. MutS was isolated by a modification of the procedure described previously (9Su S.-S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5057-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Frozen cell paste (50 g) was resuspended in 20 mm KPO4, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol (2 ml/g of cell paste), and cells were disrupted by sonication. The extract was clarified by centrifugation (15,000 × g, 45 min), and the resultant supernatant was treated with 0.25 volume of 25% (w/v) streptomycin sulfate. After stirring on ice for 30 min, the precipitate was removed by centrifugation (15,000 × g, 30 min), and the supernatant was treated with ammonium sulfate (0.18 g/ml) added over a period of 30 min. After stirring on ice for 45 min, the precipitate was collected by centrifugation (15,000 ×g, 45 min) and resuspended in 60 ml of Buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) containing 50 mm KCl and 1 mm EDTA. Aliquots of resuspended protein were diluted with Buffer A containing 50 mm KCl to the conductivity of Buffer A containing 100 mm KCl and loaded onto a 90-ml DE52 column equilibrated with Buffer A containing 100 mm KCl and 1 mmEDTA at a flow rate of 90 ml/h. After washing with 10 column volumes of this buffer, the column was eluted with a 900-ml linear gradient of KCl (100–500 mm) in Buffer A containing 0.1 mmEDTA. MutS containing fractions were pooled and loaded directly onto an 80-ml hydroxylapatite column equilibrated with 20 mmKPO4, pH 7.4, 200 mm KCl, 0.1 mmEDTA, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol at a flow rate of 80 ml/h. The column was washed with 8 volumes of this buffer and eluted with an 800-ml linear gradient of KPO4, pH 7.4 (20–200 mm) containing 200 mm KCl, 0.1 mmEDTA, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. MutS fractions were pooled and dialyzed against Buffer A containing 100 mm KCl and loaded onto a 10-ml DE52 column equilibrated with this buffer at a flow rate of 10 ml/h. After washing with 4 column volumes of starting buffer, the column was step-eluted with Buffer B (50 mmKPO4, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm2-mercaptoethanol) containing 750 mm KCl. MutS containing fractions were pooled and dialyzed against Buffer B containing 150 mm KCl and 50% (v/v) glycerol. Protein was stored at −20 °C. MutS concentrations were determined from the absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 69420m−1 cm−1 calculated from the primary amino acid sequence (23Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5059) Google Scholar). Oligodeoxyribonucleotides were purchased from Oligos Etc. (Wilsonville, OR) and, when indicated, were radiolabeled at the 5′-end with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) to a specific activity of 1 × 106 cpm/pmol. A 41-base pair (bp) G-T heteroduplex that contained a terminal biotin at one or both ends of the duplex was prepared by combining 160 nm5′-32P-labeled d(CGCCGAATTGCTAGCAAGCTGTCGAGTCTAAAAATTCGGCT)-3′-biotin with 320 nm of unlabeled d(AGCCGAATTTTTAGACTCGATAGCTTGCTAGCAATTCGGCG) that was synthesized with or without a 3′-terminal biotin. DNA samples (100 μl) were annealed in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 150 mm NaCl by heating at 99 °C in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Gene Amp 9600 thermocycler for 2 min and cooling to 25 °C over a period 90 min. Otherwise identical A·T homoduplex substrates were made by annealing 160 nm 5′-32P-labeled d(CGCCGAATTGCTAGCAAGCTATCGAGTCTAAAAATTCGGCT)-3′-biotin with 320 nm of the latter oligonucleotide above with and without a 3′-biotin. Substrates without 3′-biotin tags were prepared in a similar fashion. DNAs used for surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy were prepared by combining 1 μm of 5′-biotin-d(CGCCGAATTGCTAGCAAGCTGTCGAGTCTAAAAATTCGGCT) or 5′-biotin-d(CGCCGAATTGCTAGCAAGCTATCGAGTCTAAAAATTCGGCT) with 2 μm 5′-d(AGCCGAATTTTTAGACTCGATAGCTTGCTAGCAATTCGGCG) for 41-bp G-T heteroduplex and A·T homoduplex, respectively. Oligonucleotides (100 μl) were annealed as described above and diluted 10-fold prior to conjugation to the streptavidin sensor chip as described below. Two hundred-bp G-T heteroduplex and A·T homoduplex DNAs were prepared by the polymerase chain reaction method described previously (15Blackwell L.J. Martik D. Bjornson K.P. Bjornson E.S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32055-32062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Briefly, homoduplex and heteroduplex molecules were prepared by hybridizing single strands isolated by denaturing high pressure liquid chromatography from duplex fragments produced by the amplification of base pairs 5531–5732 of bacteriophages f1MR1 and f1MR3 (24Su S.-S. Lahue R.S. Au K.G. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6829-6835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A biotinylated f1MR1 fragment was produced using 5′-biotin-d(TACGCGCAGCGTGACCGCTA) as a forward primer and d(AAGTTTTTTGGGGTCGAGGT) as a non-biotinylated reverse primer. A non-biotinylated f1MR3 fragment was produced using the same primers lacking biotin. The 5′-biotinylated viral strand from f1MR1 (0.3 μm) was combined in a 100-μl volume with 0.6 μm of the complementary sequence prepared from f1MR1 or f1MR3 to form a homoduplex or heteroduplex, respectively. Duplexes were annealed as described above. DNA-binding reactions (20 μl) contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mmMgCl2, 50 mm KCl. 41-bp32P-homoduplex or 32P-heteroduplex, 25 μg/ml of a BstEII digest of bacteriophage λ DNA (New England Biolabs) as nonspecific competitor, streptavidin, and ATP were present as indicated. Solutions were preincubated at 25 or 37 °C as noted for 10 min, the reaction initiated by addition of MutS, and incubation continued for 10 min. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 2 μl of 50% (v/v) glycerol, 0.05% xylene cyanol, 0.05% bromphenol blue, and 20 mm EDTA, placed on ice, and loaded onto 4 or 5% native polyacrylamide gels (acrylamide/bisacrylamide, 37.5:1) in 6.7 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, and 1 mm EDTA. Gels were electrophoresed at room temperature at 11.4 V/cm in this buffer. 32P-Labeled complexes were visualized by autoradiography after drying and quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Surface plasmon resonance measurements were performed on a BIAcore 2000. A streptavidin sensor chip was derivatized with 41-bp homoduplex (305 response units) or G-T heteroduplex (306 response units) DNAs described above in which one strand was derivatized with a 5′-biotin. Additional sensor chips were derivatized with 299 response units and 298 response units of a 5′-biotin-tagged 200-bp homoduplex or G-T heteroduplex, respectively. Solutions (100 μl) of MutS in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.005% surfactant P-20, 5 mm MgCl2, containing KCl and nucleotide concentrations as indicated, were flowed across the SA chip at a rate of 20 μl/min. After MutS association, the chip was washed at 20 μl/min with 20 μl of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.005% surfactant P-20, and KCl as indicated, followed by 60 μl of the same buffer/KCl solution containing 5 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm ATP. Measurements were performed at 25 °C, and samples were maintained at 4 °C prior to injection. The SA chip was regenerated by a 20-μl injection of 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate. ATP hydrolysis by MutS was measured in 20-μl reactions at 37 °C in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 200 μm [α-32P]ATP (2500 μCi/mmol), 0.5 mg/ml streptavidin, and DNA substrates as indicated. These components, except for ATP, were assembled on ice and incubated for 10 min at room temperature to allow the conjugation of streptavidin to biotin-tagged DNAs. After supplementation with MutS (300 nm monomer equivalent) and incubation at 37 °C for 5 min, reactions were initiated by addition of the [α-32P]ATP. Rate determinations were based on removal of 2-μl samples, which were quenched in 50 μl of 0.5 m EDTA, pH 8.0. ATP hydrolysis was determined by chromatography of 1 μl of quenched sample on PEI cellulose plates (EM Science, Gibbstown, NJ) developed in 0.3m KPO4, pH 7.0. Dried plates were quantitated on a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager after overnight exposure. Initial steady-state rates of ATP hydrolysis were determined by least squares analysis of the linear portion of the progress curve. Values for the dissociation constant (Kd) for MutS DNA complexes were determined by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy by titration of chip-bound DNA with increasing concentrations of MutS. Maximum binding values obtained in this manner were plotted as a function of the protein concentration and data fit to a square hyperbola, from which the Kd value was extracted. At KCl concentrations above 100 mm in the presence or absence of nucleotide, MutS binding to 41-bp homoduplex DNA was not saturable as monitored by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy, even at the highest concentration tested (800 nm). Binding to heteroduplex also was not saturable at these salt concentrations in the presence of ATP, AMPPNP, or ATP in the absence of Mg2+. In these cases Kd values were estimated for purposes of comparison with dissociation constants obtained under conditions where saturable behavior was observed. To this end, binding isotherms were formulated by fitting binding data to a hyperbola that was constrained to the saturation value determined with heteroduplex DNA under conditions of high affinity binding (in the absence of nucleotide or in the presence of ADP). Terminal streptavidin-biotin complexes have been used to study the mechanism of nucleotide-promoted release of human MutSα from linear heteroduplex DNA (15Blackwell L.J. Martik D. Bjornson K.P.

Chem. 2000; 275: 2080-2086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We have utilized this method to explore further the nature of bacterial MutS movement along the helix in the presence of ATP. These experiments used a 41-base pair G-T heteroduplex with a centrally located mispair or an otherwise identical A·T homoduplex DNA (see “Experimental Procedures”) possessing either two free termini or one or two biotin-streptavidin terminal end-blocks. The ability of MutS to form stable DNA complexes with these DNAs in the absence or presence of ATP was tested by gel shift analysis. Due to the presence of unlabeled homoduplex competitor in all reactions, no binding was observed with the A·T homoduplex control that contained one or two streptavidin-biotin end-blocks (Fig.1, upper panel, lanes 10–13), indicating that MutS does not interact nonspecifically with the streptavidin component of such substrates. As observed previously (14Allen D.J. Makhov A. Grilley M. Taylor J. Thresher R. Modrich P. Griffith J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4467-4476Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), the presence of ATP and Mg2+ reduced the yield of MutS complexes with the streptavidin-free G-T heteroduplex by about 90% (compare lanes 1–3). However, the yield of specific complexes with the G-T DNA containing a bi-terminal streptavidin end-block was unaffected by the presence of the nucleotide (lanes 7–9), a finding similar to those obtained with human MutSα (15Blackwell L.J. Martik D. Bjornson K.P. Bjornson E.S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32055-32062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 16Gradia S. Subramanian D. Wilson T. Acharya S. Makhov A. Griffith J. Fishel R. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 255-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a single streptavidin block was largely sufficient to stabilize specific complexes in the presence of ATP (lanes 4–6). The latter finding was independent of placement of the streptavidin complex at the 3′-end of one strand or the other, or 3′ or 5′ derivatization of a particular duplex terminus (not shown), ruling out strand polarity or position effects with respect to placement of the single end-block. Quantitation of the results shown in Fig. 1 (upper panel) demonstrated that the yield of specific MutS·heteroduplex complexes in the presence of ATP, as compared with that observed in the absence of nucleotide, was 10% for the heteroduplex with free ends, 100% for the substrate with the bi-terminal block, and 80% for G-T DNA with a streptavidin-biotin complex at only one end. It is noteworthy that the complexes observed with end-blocked heteroduplexes were obtained in reactions that were initiated by addition of MutS to solutions that contained both DNA and nucleotide (“Experimental Procedures”), i.e. the formation of such complexes did not require pre-binding of MutS to DNA in the absence of nucleotide. Since these experiments were performed under conditions where MutS is catalyzing ATP hydrolysis, the enhanced yields of specific MutS·heteroduplex complexes observed with end-blocked DNAs is indicative of increased steady-state levels of these protein·DNA complexes. This effect is due at least in part to an increased lifetime of such complexes as judged by substrate challenge experiments. As shown in Fig. 1 (lower panel), MutS complexes with G-T heteroduplex lacking a terminal end-block dissociated rapidly and completely upon addition of a 600-fold excess of unlabeled G-T heteroduplex. By contrast, complexes with DNA containing a bi-terminal end-block did not dissociate significantly over a 30-min period under these conditions. MutS complexes with heteroduplex DNA blocked at one terminus behaved in an intermediate fashion. About half of the complexes dissociated upon challenge with unlabeled heteroduplex, but the remainder was stable over a 30-min period. Th"
https://openalex.org/W2039691656,"One of the most recent functions assigned to the TOR signaling pathway in yeast is the coordination of the transcription of genes involved in nutrient utilization. Here we show that transcription of ENA1, a gene encoding a lithium and sodium ion transporter essential for salt tolerance in yeast, is controlled by the TOR signaling pathway. First, ENA1 expression is strongly induced under TOR-inactivating conditions. Second, the absence of the TOR-controlled GATA transcription factors GLN3 and GAT1 results in reduced basal and salt-induced expression of ENA1. Third, a gln3 gat1 mutant displays a pronounced sensitivity to high concentrations of lithium and sodium. Fourth, TOR1, similar to ENA1, is required for growth under saline stress conditions. In summary, our results suggest that TOR plays a role in the general response to saline stress by regulating the transcription of ENA1 via GLN3 and GAT1."

Among these proteins, the paired domain transcription factor Pax-6 has been shown to bind to G1 and to transactivate glucagon gene expression. Close to the Pax-6-binding site, we observed the presence of a binding site for a basic leucine zipper transcription factor of the Maf family. In the present study, we demonstrate the presence of Maf family members in the endocrine pancreas that bind to G1 and transactivate glucagon promoter expression. In transient transfection experiments, we found that the transactivating effect on the glucagon promoter was greatly enhanced by the simultaneous expression of Maf transcription factors and Pax-6. This enhancement on glucagon transactivation could be correlated with the ability of these proteins to interact together but does not require binding of Maf proteins to the G1 element. Furthermore, we found that Maf enhanced the Pax-6 DNA binding capacity. Our data indicate that Maf transcription factors may contribute to glucagon gene expression in the pancreas.

Three proteins of 48, 46, and 43 kDa contain the paired domain, whereas two proteins of 33 and 32 kDa are devoid of this DNA binding domain. Pax-6 is known to be critical for eye development (4Callaerts P. Halder G. Gehring W.J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1997; 20: 483-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 5Chow R.L. Altmann C.R.

Pax-6 is also required for the development of all pancreatic endocrine cells and of duodenal GIP-positive cells and gastrin- and somatostatin-producing cells in the stomach (8Larsson L.I. St-Onge L.

Drucker D.J. Knepel W. Jepeal L. Misulovin Z. Habener J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 11: 4877-4888Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The G1 element contains two AT-rich sequences that are recognized by the homeodomain containing Cdx-2/3, Pax-6, and brain-4 (12Laser B. Meda P. Constant I. Philippe J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28984-28994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 13Hussain M.A. Lee J. Miller C.P. Habener J.F. Mol. Cell.

Pax-6 and Cdx-2/3 have been shown to bind directly to each other and to transactivate synergistically the glucagon gene via their interaction with the G1 element (14Ritz-Laser B. Estreicher A. Klages N. Saule S. Philippe J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4124-4132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This effect is even enhanced by interaction of these proteins with the p300 coactivator (15Hussain M.A. Habener J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28950-28957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Fine-tuning of cell type-specific gene expression and lineage-specific cell differentiation seems to be achieved by cooperative and inhibitory interactions of transcription factors. To understand the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation in pancreas, it is important to clarify the regulatory cross-talk that occurs with other transcription factors on the G1 element. Examination of the G1 element nucleotide sequence revealed the presence of a potential binding site (16Kataoka K. Noda M. Nishizawa M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 700-712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for a basic region leucine zipper (bZip) domain transcription factor of the Maf family, located close to the Pax-6-binding element. Loss-of-function of the c-Maf bZip1 factor results in defective differentiation of lens fiber cells (17Kawauchi S. Takahashi S. Nakajima O. Ogino H. Morita M. Nishizawa M. Yasuda K. Yamamoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19254-19260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 18Ring B.Z. Cordes S.P. Overbeek P.A. Barsh G.S. Development. 2000; 127: 307-317Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ectopic expression of L-Maf/MafA results in conversion of ectodermal cells into lens fibers cells, and this factor is able to activate the promoters of crystalline genes (19Ogino H. Yasuda K. Science. 1998; 280: 115-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). L-Maf/MafA, which is expressed in both lens and retina, displays mitogenic capacity when overexpressed in avian neuroretina cells (20Benkhelifa S. Provot S. Lecoq O. Pouponnot C. Calothy G. Felder-Schmittbuhl M.P. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A variety of developmental roles and transcriptional targets has been proposed for Maf transcription factors. The v-maf oncogene is the earliest described member of the family (21Nishizawa M. Kataoka K. Goto N. Fujiwara K.T. Kawai S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7711-7715Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Large Maf subfamily members (c-Maf, L-Maf/MafA, MafB, and Nrl) contain an activation domain at the N terminus, whereas small Maf subfamily members (MafF, MafK, and MafG) lack a distinct activation domain (22Blank V. Andrews N.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 437-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Maf transcription factors share structural similarity both within and outside the basic leucine zipper domain and bind common recognition elements, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate type Maf response element or cyclic AMP-response element type (16Kataoka K. Noda M. Nishizawa M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 700-712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Kerppola T.K. Curran T. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3149-3158PubMed Google Scholar). Homo- and heterodimerization through leucine zipper domains is one of the most important mechanisms underlying transcriptional regulation by bZip factors. All the Maf family members can form heterodimers with other bZip factors like Fos and Jun, and these heterodimers are different in their DNA binding specificity from Maf homodimers or AP-1 complexes (16Kataoka K. Noda M. Nishizawa M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 700-712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Kerppola T.K Curran T. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 675-684PubMed Google Scholar). BZip transcription factors are also able to interact with unrelated transcription factors like glucocorticoid receptors or Ets family members (25Jonat C. Rahmsdorf H.J. Park K.K. Cato A.C. Gebel S. Ponta H. Herrlich P. Cell. 1990; 62 (204): 1189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1371) Google Scholar, 26Basuyaux J.P. Ferreira E. Stehelin D. Buttice G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26188-26195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In the case of c-Maf, interaction with the transcription factor c-Myb plays a role during myeloid cell differentiation (27Hedge S.P. Kumar A. Kurschner C. Shapiro L.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2729-2737Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), whereas MafB interaction with c-Ets-1 represses its transcriptional activity, resulting in the inhibition of erythroid cells differentiation (28Sieweke M.H. Tekotte H. Frampton J. Graf T. Cell. 1996; 85: 49-60Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Recently, Maf family members were shown to associate with a set of Hox proteins, resulting in the inhibition of Maf DNA binding, transactivation, and transforming activities (29Kataoka K. Yoshitomo-Nakagawa K. Shioda S. Nishizawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 819-826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Thus, in view of the involvement of both Pax-6 and Maf in common developmental processes (such as lens formation), and the presence of the binding sites for both factors in the G1 element, we tested whether they could interact with and influence each other. We show that Pax-6 and MafA/L-Maf interact through their transactivation domains. This interaction results in Pax-6-enhanced DNA binding capacity on the G1 element where MafA/L-Maf is indeed able to bind. Cotransfection of a MafA/L-Maf expression plasmid and the G1-containing glucagon promoter results in an increase in CAT activity relatively to the control vector, showing that MafA can activate the glucagon promoter. Cotransfection of MafA/L-Maf expression plasmid with Pax-6 expression vector results in a 5-fold increase in CAT activity over the effect of each factor alone, suggesting a synergistic effect in expression of glucagon promoter through the G1 element by Pax-6 and MafA. This synergistic effect requires a functional paired domain but not the homeodomain. In contrast, as shown with two DNA-binding mutants, the DNA binding capacity of Maf is dispensable. Surprisingly, when the transactivation domain of MafA/Maf-L is removed, this truncated factor still increases the Pax-6 effect on the glucagon promoter. Maf protein strongly enhances the binding of Pax-6 to the G1 element, even when truncated in the transactivation domain or without DNA-binding properties. Finally, we demonstrate the presence of MafA/L-Maf in pancreas and c-Maf in endocrine cells, suggesting that Maf family members may play a role in the pancreas function. pcDNA3-MafA expression vector was obtained by inserting an EcoRI fragment corresponding to MafA open reading frame into the EcoRI site of a modified pcDNA3 vector, in frame with HA1 epitope coding sequence. Generation of mutant MafA containing the L2PL4P mutation and of truncated MafA corresponding to the bZip domain was described previously (20Benkhelifa S. Provot S. Lecoq O. Pouponnot C. Calothy G. Felder-Schmittbuhl M.P. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). For eukaryotic expression, EcoRI fragments corresponding to these open reading frames were inserted into the EcoRI site of modified pcDNA3 vector as for wild type MafA. For the synthesis of GST-MafA recombinant proteins, theEcoRI fragment corresponding to MafA open reading frame was subcloned into the EcoRI site of pGex-4T1 vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For the synthesis of GST-MafA(1–151) proteins anEagI deletion, eliminating the bZip domain, was performed in the previous construct. For the synthesis of GST-MafA (151) proteins, an EagI fragment corresponding to MafA bZip domain was subcloned into the NotI site of pGex-4T2 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Reporter construct (QR1-Abox(X4)-TK) carrying a multimerized A box from the neuroretina-specific QR1 gene, upstream of the thymidine kinase promoter, was described previously (20Benkhelifa S. Provot S. Lecoq O. Pouponnot C. Calothy G. Felder-Schmittbuhl M.P. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The glucagon promoter construct −138M3 was mutated in the MafA-binding site. To generate this mutant we used the Chameleon double-stranded site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using the −138 CAT as a template and oligonucleotide G1–51M3 (5′-CAA AAC CCC ATT ATT TAC AGA TGA GAA ATT TAT ATT GTC CTG GTA ATA TCT-3′). The 35S-radiolabeled proteins were translated in vitro using the TNT system (Promega). The GST chimerical proteins were extracted from bacteria following the Amersham Pharmacia Biotech instructions. The labeled proteins were preincubated with empty glutathione-Sepharose beads 30 min at 4 °C. The GST proteins on glutathione-Sepharose beads were preincubated with 40 μg of BSA. Bead volumes were kept constant by adding empty beads. The pull-down assays were performed in 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 20% glycerol. Proteins were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C and then the beads were washed four times in 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Baby hamster kidney (BHK)-21 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 containing 10% fetal calf serum, 1% vitamins, 100× minimum Eagle's medium, and 10 μg/ml conalbumin. Cells were seeded 24 h prior to transfection. BHK21 cells transfections were performed with polyethyleneimine (exgen 500, Euromedex, Souffelweyersheim) reagent according to the instructions of the manufacturer. 200 ng of expression plasmids were cotransfected except where mentioned in the figure legend. αTC cells transfections were performed by the calcium-phosphate method. The total amount of transfected DNA was kept constant by addition of empty expression vector DNA. A LRTRSV-LacZ vector or a pcDNA3-LacZ was cotransfected for normalization of CAT assays by controlling the β-galactosidase activity. CAT assays were performed as described previously (30Plaza S. Dozier C. Saule S. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 1041-1050PubMed Google Scholar). Levels of CAT activity were quantified after exposure of the thin layer chromatograms to a PhosphorImager screen (Molecular Dynamics). The DNA used as probes were G1–51, G1–51M10, and G1–51M3 and as a control the Mitf-binding site in the QNR-71 promoter. G1–51 (5′-CAA AAC CCC ATT ATT TAC AGA TGA GAA ATT TAT ATT GTC AGC GTA ATA TCT-3′) is a wild type glucagon promoter element described previously (14Ritz-Laser B. Estreicher A. Klages N. Saule S. Philippe J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4124-4132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) to bind Pax-6. G1–51M10 (5′-CAA AAC CCC ATT CCCGCCCCA GGA GAA ATT TAT ATT GTC AGC GTA ATA TCT-3′) is mutated in the Pax-6-binding site (14Ritz-Laser B. Estreicher A. Klages N. Saule S. Philippe J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4124-4132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). G1–51M3 (5′-CAA AAC CCC ATT ATT TAC AGA TGA GAA ATT TAT ATT GTC CTG GTA ATA TCT-3′) is mutated in the presumptive Maf-binding site. Underlines represent mutations introduced in the oligonucleotides. QNR-71 oligonucleotide is 5′-GCT TTA ATT CCA TCA CAT GAT GAG TCC TG-3′. The DNA probes were double-strand oligonucleotides [γ-32P]ATP-labeled with the polynucleotide kinase T4. Gel retardation assays were performed as described previously (30Plaza S. Dozier C. Saule S. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 1041-1050PubMed Google Scholar) with 100 ng of bacterially expressed proteins. To visualize Pax-6 and MafA proteins, green fluorescent protein (GFP, CLONTECH) and Discosoma striatared protein (DsRed,CLONTECH) were used as fusion partners of p46 and MafA, respectively, and the following plasmids were constructed. AnNheI-BglII EGFP fragment was ligated to theXbaI and BglII sites of pVNC3 (modified from pVM116, see Ref. 31Klempnauer K.-H. Arnold H. Biedenkapp H. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1582-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) to produce pVNC3 EGFP C1. ABamHI-ApaI MafA fragment was inserted into theBglII and ApaI sites of pVNC3 EGFP to make pVNC EGFP MafA. pVNC3 MiRed (32Planque N. Leconte L. Coquelle F.M. Martin P. Saule S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29330-29337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) was digested with XhoI and Bsp120I to excise the Mitf open reading frame and to replace it by aXhoI-NotI p46 fragment to generate pVNC3 Pax6Red. As controls, we used EGFPMyc and Pax6EGFP (32Planque N. Leconte L. Coquelle F.M. Martin P. Saule S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29330-29337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). pVNC3 Pax6Red and pVNC EGFP MafA were cotransfected in BHK21 cells. To determine the localization of the chimerical proteins into the nuclei, cells were fixed for 20 min at room temperature in 3% paraformaldehyde in PHEM buffer (60 mm Pipes, 25 mm Hepes, 10 mm EGTA, 1 mmmagnesium acetate, pH 6.9). Cells were washed three times in PBS and permeabilized for 25 min in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. Chromosomes were stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma) for 5 min. After a rinse in PBS, coverslips were mounted in 50% PBS/glycerol containing anti-fading reagent 1.4 diazabicyclo-(2-2-2)octane (Sigma) at 100 mg/ml. Pictures of fixed cells were collected using a three-dimensional deconvolution imaging system, the detailed description and validation of which will be published elsewhere. 2J. B. Sibarita et al., submitted for publication. Briefly, it consisted of a Leica DM RXA microscope, equipped with a piezoelectric translator (PIFOC, PI, Germany) placed at the base of a 100× PlanApo N.A. 1.4 objective, and a 5-MHz Micromax 1300Y interline CCD camera (Roper Instruments, France). For the acquisition of Z-series, the camera was operated at full speed and controlled the piezo translator at the start of each CCD chip read out. Stacks containing fluorescence images were collected automatically at 0.2-μm Z-intervals (Metamorph software, Universal Imaging). Wavelength selection was achieved by switching to the corresponding motorized selective Leica filter block before each stack acquisition. Tests using 50 nm tetraspec beads (Molecular Probes) showed that the system did not generatex-y pixel shifts and that Z-plane shifts between colors, due to chromatic aberrations, were reproducible and could be corrected. Exposure times were adjusted to provide ∼3000 gray levels at sites of strong labeling. Automated batch deconvolution of each Z-series was computed using a measured point spread function and constrained iterative deconvolution with a custom made software package. The point spread function of the optical system was extracted from three-dimensional images of fluorescent beads of 0.1 μm in diameter (Molecular Probes) collected at each wavelength. The Z-series were pseudo-colored and overlaid, and maximal pixel intensity projections were calculated with the help of Metamorph software (Universal Imaging). Total RNA from pancreas from 8-day-old quail embryos were digested with RQI DNase. After phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, 2 μg of these RNA were annealed with 0.5 μl of oligonucleotide dT (Perkin-Elmer) (50 μm) for 10 min at 70 °C. The cDNA were obtained by adding 1 μl of 0.1m dithiothreitol, 2 μl of 5 mm dNTP mix (Eurogentec), 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus-RT (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 4 μl of 5× buffer in a final volume of 20 μl. The mixture was incubated for 1 h at 42 °C. For the PCR, a 2-μl aliquot was added to 1.6 μl of 25 mmMgCl2, 1 μl of 5 mm dNTP mix (Eurogentec), 0.5 units of Goldstar Taq (Eurogentec), 2 μl of 10× buffer, 1 μl of 20 μm oligonucleotide primers 5′-TTC CAC CCC TCT CAG CAC-3′ and 5′-CTC CCG AAC CGA CAT ACT-3′, in a final volume of 20 μl. Amplifications were carried out in a PTC-200 (MJ Research) as follows: 96 °C for 2 min; 30 cycles at 94 °C for 45 s, 50 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 45 s; 72 °C for 10 min. Reaction products were cloned into PCR2.1 (TA cloning Kit, Invitrogen). Individual clones were isolated and sequenced. Similar experiments were performed using αTC cells RNA and oligonucleotide primers Maf5′1, Maf5′2, and Maf3′2 as described (20Benkhelifa S. Provot S. Lecoq O. Pouponnot C. Calothy G. Felder-Schmittbuhl M.P. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). αTC cells cultured on 16-mm microscope coverslips were fixed for 1 h with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS and then treated with anti v-Maf serum (a gift of Dr. M. Castellazzi). Anti-c-Maf-reactive proteins were detected with CY3-labeled goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulins secondary reagent (Jackson ImmunoResearch). To test the hypothesis that Pax-6 physically interacts with MafA, we prepared glutathione-Sepharose beads coupled with a GST-paired fusion protein containing the paired domain from the p46 (GST-Prd46(3–131)) and GST-Hom (224), containing the p46 homeodomain, and the GST-p46(1–416), containing the full-length Pax-6 product. We also used GST fusion proteins containing either the N-terminal (residues 1–151) or the C-terminal domains (residues 151–286) of MafA or the full-length protein. Glutathione-Sepharose beads coupled to GST served as a negative control. In vitroradiolabeled MafA/L-Maf or Pax-6 proteins were loaded onto these beads and washed, and bound proteins were eluted by boiling and analyzed in SDS-PAGE. The percentage of bound radioactivity was calculated using PhosphorImager. A similar amount of radiolabeled MafA was recovered from GST-Prd46 (0.4%) and from GST-Hom (0.2%). In contrast, a much higher amount of radiolabeled MafA protein (8.6%) was recovered from the GST-p46, suggesting that the transactivation domain of Pax-6 is involved in the protein-protein interaction (Fig.1 A). As shown in Fig. 1 B, both the N terminus of MafA (amino acids 1–151, 1%, lane 2) and the C-terminal (amino acids 151–286, 0.8%, lane 3) domains were independently able to bind the radiolabeled p46. However, it is important to note that a greater amount of GST-N-terminal protein has been used in the experiment (Fig. 1 C, compare lanes 1 with2 and 3) suggesting in fact a lower efficiency of this part of the MafA protein in the interaction with the p46. The full size Maf bound with a greater efficiency (19%) than the two separated parts of the protein. The GST alone did not interact with the radiolabeled MafA (Fig. 1 B, lane 1). As a positive control, we incubated the full size GST-MafA(1–286) with the radiolabeled MafA (Fig. 1 D). The amount of recovered protein (10%, lane 1) was similar to the amount p46 recovery (Fig. 1 B, lane 4), suggesting a strong interaction between the two proteins. As a negative control, we incubated the full size GST-MafA(1–286) with the nonrelevant radiolabeled GFP protein. No interaction could be observed between these two proteins (Fig. 1 E). As for Engrailed (33Plaza S. Langlois M.C. Turque N. LeCornet S. Bailly M. Begue A. Quatannens B. Dozier C. Saule S. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 1115-1125PubMed Google Scholar) or Mitf (32Planque N. Leconte L. Coquelle F.M. Martin P. Saule S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29330-29337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), two p46-interacting proteins, the paired-less p30 proteins did not significantly bind to either part of MafA (Fig.1 B). Nrl, a large Maf family member, acts synergistically with the paired-like homeodomain transcription factor Crx to activate the rhodopsin gene (34Chen S. Wang Q.L. Nie Z. Sun H. Lennon G. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Zack D.J. Neuron. 1997; 19: 1017-1030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 35Chau K.Y. Chen S. Zack D.J. Ono S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37264-37270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). A potential Maf-binding site (TCAGCG) is present close to the Pax-6-binding site in the G1 element of the glucagon promoter. Therefore, we tested if the observed Pax-6/Maf interaction was able to regulate expression of Pax-6-dependent glucagon promoter. BHK21 cell lysates were collected 2 days after transfection, and the levels of CAT and β-galactosidase activities present in the lysates were determined. Cotransfection of the G1 containing −138 glucagon promoter with the vector expressing the MafA/L-Maf protein resulted in an increase of CAT activity relative to that of the control vector (Fig.2). Similar increase of CAT activity was observed with the −138 glucagon promoter in response to Pax-6 protein expression. Cotransfection of the −138 glucagon promoter with the vectors expressing MafA and Pax-6 proteins resulted in a 5-fold increase of CAT activity relative to the level of expression obtained with each transcription factor alone. The synergistic activation obtained was specific of this promoter because no synergistic effect was observed on the CMV- or RSVLTR-lacZ cotransfected in the experiment. The G3–138, containing an additional Pax-6-binding site (14Ritz-Laser B. Estreicher A. Klages N. Saule S. Philippe J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4124-4132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), also exhibited this synergistic response, except that the CAT activity was increased (Fig. 2 B) and the promoter −350 behaved similarly (Fig. 2 C). In contrast, the G3 element linked to the −31 sequence, showed a marginal activation by both Pax-6 and MafA/L-Maf, suggesting that the G1 element is indeed essential in the Maf response of the glucagon promoter and synergy with Pax-6. Another Pax family member (Pax-2) has been described to activate the glucagon promoter through the G1 element (36Ritz-Laser B. Estreicher A. Gauthier B. Philippe J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32708-32715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We tested the effect of the simultaneous expression of Pax-2 and MafA on the G3–138 glucagon promoter. The D2 form of Pax-2 (a splicing variant in the transactivation domain) was a better transactivator than Pax-6, whereas the C form (36Ritz-Laser B. Estreicher A. Gauthier B. Philippe J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32708-32715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) exhibited only a marginal effect on glucagon expression (Fig. 3 A). On these two Pax-2 isoforms, MafA/L-Maf had a rather additional than synergistic effect (Fig. 3 A). In contrast to Pax-6, Pax-2 contains only a partial homeodomain (37Dahl E. Koseki H. Balling R. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 755-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Therefore, we asked whether the homeodomain of Pax-6 was required for the synergistic transactivation of the glucagon promoter observed with MafA. We used a Pax-6 mutant, which is devoid of homeodomain, (Pax-6Δ170–270, see Ref. 2Carriere C. Plaza S. Caboche J. Dozier C. Bailly M. Martin P. Saule S. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1531-1540PubMed Google Scholar). This Pax-6 mutant transactivated the G3–138 glucagon promoter to an extent similar to that of the wild type, suggesting that the homeodomain is dispensable for G3–138 glucagon promoter activation (Fig.3 B). Cotransfection of the MafA/L-Maf revealed that the Pax-6Δ170–270 mutant increased glucagon promoter transactivation with MafA. We next asked whether a functional paired domain was required. For that purpose, we used the p48 isoform of Pax-6, which recognizes a distinct DNA-binding sequence due to the insertion of 14 amino acid residues in the paired domain (38Epstein J.A. Glaser T. Cai J. Jepeal L. Walton D.S. Maas R.L. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2022-2034Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). p48 is unable to transactivate the glucagon promoter (Fig. 3 B). Coexpression of p48 and MafA proteins did not modify the level of CAT activity when compared with MafA alone (Fig. 3 B), indicating that the binding of Pax-6 to DNA through the paired domain is required in order to increase the MafA/L-Maf effect on this promoter. These results prompted us to study the effect of MafA/L-Maf truncated proteins devoid of transactivation domain in the cooperative transcriptional activation with Pax-6. Fig. 3 C shows that this mutant MafA(173–286) was no longer able to activate the glucagon promoter but still increased the effect of Pax-6 on the G3–138 promoter, suggesting that binding of MafA to the DNA was sufficient to"

Since hydroxylations of the C-27 position of cholesterol, 5β-cholestane-3α,7α-diol, and 5β-cholestane-3α,7α,12α-triol are all catalyzed by CYP27 (3Okuda K. Masumoto O. Ohyama Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18138-18142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), virtually all bile acids are synthesized from 5β-cholestane-3α,7α,12α-triol via the microsomal 25-hydroxylation side chain cleavage pathway in CTX (Fig.1). While a disrupted CYP27 gene causes CTX in humans,CYP27 knockout mice do not show typical CTX-related pathological or biochemical abnormalities (16Rosen H. Reshef A. Maeda N. Lippoldt A. Shpizen S.

Recently we measured hepatic concentrations of intermediates in bile acid biosynthesis inCyp27−/− mice and compared them with those in CTX (17Honda A. Salen G. Matsuzaki Y. Batta A.K. Xu G. Leitersdorf E. Tint G.S. Erickson S.K. Tanaka N. Shefer S. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 291-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In Cyp27−/− mice, microsomal concentrations of early intermediates in the bile acid biosynthetic pathway (7α-hydroxycholesterol, 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one, 7α,12α-dihydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one, and 5β-cholestane-3α,7α,12α-triol), and 25-hydroxylated bile alcohols (5β-cholestane-3α,7α,12α,25-tetrol, 5β-cholestane-3α,7α,12α,23R,25-pentol, and 5β-cholestane-3α,7α,12α,24R,25-pentol) were all significantly elevated compared with those inCyp27+/+ mice, but the levels were much lower than those in CTX patients. Therefore, we speculated that these intermediates were more efficiently metabolized by the microsomal 25-hydroxylation side chain cleavage pathway inCyp27−/− mice than in CTX. Until recently, the microsomal enzymes involved in the 25-hydroxylation pathway had not been characterized. However, Furster and Wikvall (18Furster C. Wikvall K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1437: 46-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) demonstrated in 1999 that CYP3A4 was the predominant enzyme responsible for 25-hydroxylation of 5β-cholestane-3α,7α,12α-triol in human liver microsomes. The present study was undertaken to identify the enzymes responsible for the formation of bile alcohols other than 5β-cholestane-3α,7α,12α,25-tetrol, and to explain whyCyp27−/− mice accumulate less amounts of bile acid intermediates compared with CTX. We measured several enzyme activities in the 25-hydroxylation pathway by an improved assay method based on high-resolution GC-MS (19Honda A. Salen G. Shefer S. Matsuzaki Y. Xu G. Batta A.K. Tint G.S.

The results showed that CYP3A catalyzed not only 25-hydroxylation of 5β-cholestane-3α,7α,12α-triol but also carried out other side chain hydroxylations on 5β-cholestane-3α,7α,12α-triol and 5β-cholestane-3α,7α,12α,25-tetrol. 7α-Hydroxycholesterol was obtained from Steraloids (Wilton, NH). 27-Hydroxycholesterol was synthesized from diosgenin (20Kim H.-S.

The statistical significance of differences between the results in the different groups was evaluated by the Student's two-tailedt test. Correlation was tested by calculating Pearson's correlation coefficient, r. In all statistical tests, significance was accepted at the level of p < 0.05. Table I shows hepatic mitochondrial 27-hydroxylase activities toward cholesterol and 5β-cholestane-3α,7α,12α-triol. The activities of 27-hydroxylation of both cholesterol and 5β-cholestane-3α,7α,12α-triol were virtually absent inCyp27−/− mice while very low but significant activities were detected in the CTX patient.Table IHepatic mitochondrial 27-hydroxylase activities toward cholesterol and 5β-cholestane-3α,7α,12α-triol in female Cyp27−/− mice and a CTX patientSubstrateCholesterol5β-Cholestane-3α,7α,12α-triolpmol/min/mg proteinHuman CTX (n = 1)0.01 aNinety-five percent confidence interval for control mean.0.7 bp < 0.0001 versusCyp27+/+ mice.

However, microsomal cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase, 12α-hydroxylase, and mitochondrial 5β-cholestane-3α,7α,12α-triol 27-hydroxylase activities were not correlated with testosterone 6β-hydroxylase activity.Table IVCorrelations between the activities of testosterone 6β-hydroxylase, a marker enzyme for CYP3A, and other hydroxylase activities in control human liver (n = 8)SubstratePosition of hydroxylationResponsible P-450Correlation (r)Cholesterol7α7A10.01727aActivities in mitochondrial fraction.

Open table in a new tab Recombinant overexpressed human CYP3A4 (9.2 pmol of P450) was incubated at 37 °C for 5 h with 50 μm5β-cholestane-3α,7α,12α-triol, and the bile alcohol fraction was derivatized as trimethylsilyl ethers and analyzed by GC-MS. Fig.5 A represents the total ion chromatogram of the sample. Mass spectrometric analysis confirmed the formations of 5β-cholestane-3α,7α,12α,25-tetrol (III), 5β-cholestane-3α,7α,12α,26-tetrol (IV), 5β-cholestane-3α,7α,12α,23R,25-pentol (V), 5β-cholestane-3α,7α,12α,24R,25-pentol (VI), and 5β-cholestane-3α,7α,12α,24S,25-pentol (VII). Reference compounds for 5β-cholestane-3α,7α,12α,23ξ-tetrol (I) and 5β-cholestane-3α,7α,12α,24ξ-tetrol (II) were not available, but they were identified from previous GC-MS data (34Tint G.S. Dayal B. Batta A.K. Shefer S. Cheng F.W. Salen G. Mosbach E.H. J. Lipid Res. 1978; 19: 956-966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, several unknown 25-, 26-, or 27-hydroxylated bile alcohol peaks (a-e) were detected in the incubation mixture. These bile alcohol peaks were not observed when boiled (for 5 min) CYP3A4 was used for the assay (Fig. 5 B). The activities of 25- and 26-hydroxylations of 5β-cholestane-3α,7α,12α-triol and 23R-, 24R-, 24S-, and 27-hydroxylations of 5β-cholestane-3α,7α,12α,25-tetrol by the recombinant CYP3A4 were 4894, 318, 1820, 166, 245, and 46 pmol/min/nmol P450, respectively. The ratio of these six hydroxylation activities in CYP3A4 was similar to that in human liver microsomes and a strong correlation (r = 0.939, p < 0.01,n = 6) existed between the six enzyme activities by CYP3A4 and those in human liver microsomes (mean activities from 10 control humans). IC50 values for troleandomycin, a specific inhibitor of CYP3A, determined by using recombinant human CYP3A4 and pooled human liver microsomes are shown in Table V. Troleandomycin markedly inhibited 6β-hydroxylation of testosterone, 25- and 26-hydroxylations of 5β-cholestane-3α,7α,12α-triol and 23R-, 24R-, 24S-, and 27-hydroxylations of 5β-cholestane-3α,7α,12α,25-tetrol in both recombinant CYP3A4 and microsomes, but IC50 values for microsomes were somewhat higher than those for recombinant CYP3A4.Table VEffects of troleandomycin, a specific inhibitor of CYP3A, on hydroxylase activities by recombinant overexpressed human CYP3A4 and pooled control human liver microsomesSubstratePosition of hydroxylationIC50Recombinant CYP3A4MicrosomesμmTestosterone6β1255β-Cholestane-3α,7α,12α-triol250.525261255β-Cholestane-3α,7α,12α,25-tetrol23R0.51024R1524S0.510270.55Data points represent the mean of duplicate determinations.

Fig. 6 illustrates the effects of adding increasing amounts of troleandomycin on side chain hydroxylation enzyme activities in Cyp27−/− mice liver. When troleandomycin was added to the incubation mixtures, microsomal 25- and 26-hydroxylations of 5β-cholestane-3α,7α,12α-triol and 23R-, 24R-, 24S-, and 27-hydroxylations of 5β-cholestane-3α,7α,12α,25-tetrol were all inhibited in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, mitochondrial 27-hydroxylation of 5β-cholestane-3α,7α,12α-triol was not suppressed by troleandomycin. Our previous studies showed that several side chain hydroxylations of 5β-cholestane-3α,7α,12α-triol and 5β-cholestane-3α,7α,12α,25-tetrol were coordinately up-regulated by phenobarbital administration in rats (8Cheng F.W. Shefer S. Dayal B. Tint G.S. Setoguchi T. Salen G. Mosbach E.H. J. Lipid Res. 1977; 18: 6-13Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and cholesterol or bile fistula treatment in rabbits (19Honda A. Salen G. Shefer S. Matsuzaki Y. Xu G. Batta A.K. Tint G.S. Tanaka N. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 442-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, we have partially purified 5β-cholestane-3α,7α,12α,25-tetrol 24S-hydroxylase in rat liver microsomes by polyethylene glycol precipitation, octylamine-agarose chromatography, hydroxylapatite chromatography, and diethylaminoethyl-Sepharose chromatography. However, the 24S-hydroxylase fraction still contained substantial 5β-cholestane-3α,7α,12α-triol 25-hydroxylase, and 5β-cholestane-3α,7α,12α,25-tetrol 23R-, 24R-, and 27-hydroxylase activities. 2A. Honda and G. Salen, unpublished observation. It was reported that mitochondrial sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27) catalyzed not only 27-hydroxylation of cholesterol and 5β-cholestane-3α,7α,12α-triol but also 24- and 25-hydroxylations of cholesterol (35Lund E. Björkhem I. Furster C. Wikvall K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1166: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and 25-hydroxylation of vitamin D (36Usui E. Noshiro M. Ohyama Y. Okuda K. FEBS Lett. 1990; 274: 175-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Therefore, we speculated that the microsomal 25-hydroxylation of 5β-cholestane-3α,7α,12α-triol and some other hydroxylations of 5β-cholestane-3α,7α,12α,25-tetrol were catalyzed by a common enzyme. Recently, Furster and Wikvall (18Furster C. Wikvall K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1437: 46-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) demonstrated that human microsomal 25-hydroxylation of 5β-cholestane-3α,7α,12α-triol was catalyzed mainly by CYP3A4. This hydroxylation was also catalyzed by recombinant overexpressed human CYP2B6, CYP2C19, and CYP3A5. However, the most abundantly expressed form of P450 in human liver is CYP3A4 (as much as 60% of all hepatic P450) (37Guengerich F.P. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1990; 3: 363-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), and the rates of 25-hydroxylation by CYP2B6 and CYP2C19 were only 5 and 8% as active as that by CYP3A4, respectively (18Furster C. Wikvall K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1437: 46-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Recombinant CYP3A5 showed 23% of the activity by Cyp3A4 (18Furster C. Wikvall K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1437: 46-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) but hepatic CYP3A5 is polymorphically expressed in only 10 to 30% of humans (38Maurel P. Ioannides C. Cytochromes P450: Metabolic and Toxicological Aspects. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1996: 241-270Google Scholar). We did not measure side chain hydroxylase activities by other recombinant expressed human P-450 enzymes, but the following evidence lends support to this hypothesis that not only 25-hydroxylation of 5β-cholestane-3α,7α,12α-triol but also many other microsomal side chain hydroxylations are catalyzed by CYP3A (3A4 and 3A5) in humans. 1) Strong positive correlations existed between testosterone 6β-hydroxylase activity, a marker activity for CYP3A, and the six microsomal side chain hydroxylase activities in human liver microsomes from eight unrelated donors (Table IV); 2) these seven microsomal enzyme activities were markedly suppressed by troleandomycin, a specific inhibitor of CYP3A (39Ono S. Hatanaka T. Hotta H. Satoh T. Gonzalez F.J. Tsutsui M. Xenobiotica. 1996; 26: 681-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) (Table V); 3) the six microsomal side chain hydroxylase activities were detected in recombinant human CYP3A4 (Fig. 5); and 4) the ratio of these six hydroxylase activities in human liver microsomes was similar to that of recombinant CYP3A4 with a strong correlation (r = 0.939). In the IC50 experiments, troleandomycin markedly inhibited all microsomal hydroxylations we tested, but IC50values for human pooled microsomes were somewhat higher than those for recombinant CYP3A4. The difference appears to be caused by the existence of microsomal CYP3A5 which is polymorphically expressed in some human subjects. Although troleandomycin is a specific inhibitor of CYP3A4 and 3A5, an IC50 value for CYP3A5 is larger than that for CYP3A4 (39Ono S. Hatanaka T. Hotta H. Satoh T. Gonzalez F.J. Tsutsui M. Xenobiotica. 1996; 26: 681-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Actually, the microsomes showed higher IC50 value than recombinant CYP3A4 when they were determined by assaying testosterone 6β-hydroxylase that is a marker enzyme for CYP3A4 and 3A5. In mice, CYP3A11 is the major CYP3A enzyme in the liver and it has been reported that the purified CYP3A11, called P450UT as a trivial name, possesses high activity for testosterone 6β-hydroxylation (40Bornheim L.M. Correia M.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 38: 319-326PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the sizes of exons and amino acid sequences of CYP3A11 are highly homologous to those of human CYP3A4 (41Toide K. Itoh S. Nagasaka Y. Yanagimoto T. Kamataki T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 338: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In our experiments, side chain hydroxylations in mouse microsomes were markedly suppressed by troleandomycin (Fig. 6) and the IC50 values were similar to those for human microsomes. Therefore, CYP3A11 seems to be the predominant enzyme responsible for side chain hydroxylations of 5β-cholestane-3α,7α,12α-triol and 5β-cholestane-3α,7α,12α,25-tetrol in mice liver microsomes. Accumulation of 25-hydroxylated C27-bile alcohols is a characteristic feature of CTX. In the bile and plasma, the major bile alcohol is the glucuronic acid conjugate of 5β-cholestane-3α,7α,12α,25-tetrol, whereas in urine, the glucuronic acid conjugates of 5β-cholestane-3α,7α,12α,23R,25-pentol, 5β-cholestane-3α,7α,12α,24R,25-pentol, and 5β-cholestane-3α,7α,12α,24S,25-pentol predominate (14Hoshita T. Yasuhara M. Une M. Kibe A. Itoga E. Kito S. Kuramoto T. J. Lipid Res. 1980; 21: 1015-1021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Batta A.K. Shefer S. Batta M. Salen G. J. Lipid Res. 1985; 26: 690-698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Batta A.K. Salen G. Shefer S. Tint G.S. Batta M. J. Lipid Res. 1987; 28: 1006-1012Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The virtual absence of 5β-cholestane-3α,7α,12α,25-tetrol and the large quantities of pentahydroxy bile alcohols in urine suggested that the urinary pentahydroxy bile alcohols, at least in part, might be formed by the renal hydroxylation of 5β-cholestane-3α,7α,12α,25-tetrol which was produced in the liver (42Batta A.K. Salen G. Shefer S. Tint G.S. Batta M. J. Lipid Res. 1987; 28: 1006-1012Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to human liver, CYP3A5 is consistently present while CYP3A4 is expressed in 40 to 90% of subjects in human kidney (43Haehner B.D. Gorski J.C. Vandenbranden M. Wrighton S.A. Janardan S.K. Watkins P.B. Hall S.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 52-59PubMed Google Scholar, 44Murray G.I. McFadyen M.C. Mitchell R.T. Cheung Y.L. Kerr A.C. Melvin W.T. Br. J. Cancer. 1999; 79: 1836-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Thus, CYP3A5 may be the predominant enzyme responsible for the formation of pentahydroxy bile alcohols in the kidney of CTX patients. It should be mentioned that as reported previously (18Furster C. Wikvall K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1437: 46-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), the incubation of human CYP3A4 with 5β-cholestane-3α,7α,12α-triol produced significant amounts of 5β-cholestane-3α,7α,12α,23ξ-tetrol and 5β-cholestane-3α,7α,12α,24ξ-tetrol in addition to a large amount of 5β-cholestane-3α,7α,12α,25-tetrol (Fig.5 A). Therefore, some of the pentahydroxy bile alcohols produced in CTX may be synthesized by 25-hydroxylation of 5β-cholestane-3α,7α,12α,23ξ-tetrol and 5β-cholestane-3α,7α,12α,24ξ-tetrol. In Cyp27−/− mice, hepatic concentrations of early intermediates in bile acid biosynthesis and 25-hydroxylated bile alcohols were significantly elevated compared with those inCyp27+/+ mice (17Honda A. Salen G. Matsuzaki Y. Batta A.K. Xu G. Leitersdorf E. Tint G.S. Erickson S.K. Tanaka N. Shefer S. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 291-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but the levels were much lower than found in the CTX patient. In particular, femaleCyp27−/− mice showed less accumulation of the early bile acid intermediates than maleCyp27−/− mice. In comparison with the CTX patient and male Cyp27−/− mice, femaleCyp27−/− mice had limited up-regulation of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase activity (2-foldversus 6.5-fold in maleCyp27−/− mice and 22-fold in CTX). In contrast, CYP3A was markedly stimulated in both male and femaleCyp27−/− mice but not up-regulated in CTX. Thus, the low accumulation of the intermediates in female mice appears to be due to the limited up-regulation of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase with markedly stimulated CYP3A. However, the reason for the limited up-regulation of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase in femaleCyp27−/− mice remains unknown. Markedly reduced pool size of bile acids including cholic acid is another feature of Cyp27−/− mice (16Rosen H. Reshef A. Maeda N. Lippoldt A. Shpizen S. Triger L. Eggertsen G. Björkhem I. Leitersdorf E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14805-14812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 45Repa J.J. Lund E.G. Horton J.D. Leitersdorf E. Russell D.W. Dietschy J.M. Turley S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39685-39692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), which is different from CTX patients where the pool size of cholic acid was normal while that of chenodeoxycholic acid was markedly reduced (2Salen G. Shefer S. Tint G.S. Nicolau G. Dayal B. Batta A.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 744-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Despite coordinate up-regulation of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase and CYP3A, Cyp27−/− mice do not appear to produce a sufficient amount of cholic acid. The ratio of 5β-cholestane-3α,7α,12α,25-tetrol 23R-, 24R-, 24S-, and 27-hydroxylase activities inCyp27−/− mice liver microsomes was about 74:22:4:0 (Table III) while in CTX liver microsomes the ratio was about 60:18:18:4 (Table II). The results suggest that only 4% of 5β-cholestane-3α,7α,12α,25-tetrol was used for cholic acid synthesis in Cyp27−/− mice, whereas 18% of 5β-cholestane-3α,7α,12α,25-tetrol was converted into cholic acid in CTX. In Cyp27−/− mice, the pentols except for 5β-cholestane-3α,7α,12α,24S,25-pentol may be eliminated more efficiently from the body than in CTX. The different response of CYP3A to block CYP27 betweenCyp27−/− mice and CTX is intriguing. In this study, we measured CYP3A activities in the single CTX subject, but also previously reported that 5β-cholestane-3α,7α,12α-triol 25-hydroxylase and 5β-cholestane-3α,7α,12α,25-tetrol 24S-hydroxylase activities were not up-regulated in other CTX patients (2Salen G.

Invest. 1979; 63: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). CYP3A4 is responsible for the oxidative metabolism of a wide variety of compounds including an estimated 60% of all clinically used drugs: e.g. dexamethasone, cyclosporin, lovastatin, nifedipine, imidazole antimycotics, and macrolide antibiotics (38Maurel P. Ioannides C. Cytochromes P450: Metabolic and Toxicological Aspects. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1996: 241-270Google Scholar), and in addition to 5β-cholestane-3α,7α,12α-triol, 5β-cholestane-3α,7α,12α,25-tetrol, and testosterone, several endogenous substrates are also metabolized. Cortisol, progesterone, and androstenedione are 6β-hydroxylated, pregnenolone, dehydroepiandrosterone, and estrone are 16α-hydroxylated, and estradiol is 2- and 4-hydroxylated (18Furster C. Wikvall K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1437: 46-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 38Maurel P. Ioannides C. Cytochromes P450: Metabolic and Toxicological Aspects. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1996: 241-270Google Scholar). Many but not all of these compounds are known to induce the expression of the CYP3A4gene (38Maurel P. Ioannides C. Cytochromes P450: Metabolic and Toxicological Aspects. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1996: 241-270Google Scholar). Recent reports by Lehmann et al. (46Lehmann J.M. McKee D.D. Watson M.A. Willson T.M. Moore J.T. Kliewer S.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1016-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the pregnane X receptor, an orphan nuclear receptor, was bound to a response element in the CYP3A4 promoter and was activated by a range of drugs known to induce CYP3A4 expression. In addition, comparison of human pregnane X receptor with mouse pregnane X receptor revealed marked differences in their activation by certain compounds. Therefore, it is possible that 5β-cholestane-3α,7α,12α-triol is an efficient inducer ofCYP3A expression in mice but not in humans. In summary, hepatic microsomal 23ξ-, 24ξ-, 25-, and 26-hydroxylations of 5β-cholestane-3α,7α,12α-triol and 23R-, 24R-, 24S-, and 27-hydroxylations of 5β-cholestane-3α,7α,12α,25-tetrol were all catalyzed by CYP3A. In Cyp27−/− mice, cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase activity was not up-regulated as much as that in a CTX patient whereas CYP3A was markedly increased. In contrast, considerable up-regulation of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase without up-regulation of CYP3A was observed in CTX. These results appear to explain whyCyp27−/− mice do not accumulate bile acid intermediates and develop the phenotype as seen in CTX subjects.

A direct protein-protein interaction between Ras and the N-terminal regulatory domain of Raf is critical for Raf activation. However, association with Ras is not sufficient to activate Raf in vitro, indicating that Ras must activate some other biochemical events leading to activation of Raf. We have observed that RasV12Y32F and RasV12T35S mutants fail to activate Raf, yet retain the ability to interact with Raf. In this report, we showed that RasV12Y32F and RasV12T35S can cooperate with members of the Rho family GTPases to activate Raf while alone the Rho family GTPase is not effective in Raf activation. A dominant negative mutant of Rac or RhoA can block Raf activation by Ras. The effect of Rac or Cdc42 can be substituted by the Pak kinase, which is a direct downstream target of Rac/Cdc42. Furthermore, expression of a kinase inactive mutant of Pak or the N-terminal inhibitory domain of Pak1 can block the effect of Rac or Cdc42. In contrast, Pak appears to play no direct role in relaying the signal from RhoA to Raf, indicating that RhoA utilizes a different mechanism than Rac/Cdc42. Membrane-associated but not cytoplasmic Raf can be activated by Rac or RhoA. Our data support a model by which the Rho family small GTPases play an important role to mediate the activation of Raf by Ras. Ras, at least, has two distinct functions in Raf activation, recruitment of Raf to the plasma membrane by direct binding and stimulation of Raf activating kinases via the Rho family GTPases.

Willumsen B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 851-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar). Ras plays an essential role in regulating a wide range of cellular functions, including cell proliferation, differentiation, oncogenic transformation, and development (2Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Clark G.J. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1395-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar, 3Katz M.E. McCormick F. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The GTP-bound, but not the GDP-bound, form of Ras directly binds to and regulates its downstream targets. Numerous downstream targets of Ras have been identified that mediate the signal transduction of Ras. Raf, a serine/threonine kinase, originally isolated as a viral oncogene contributing to cellular transformation, is one of the best characterized Ras effectors and activates the MEK1-ERK pathway (4Howe L.R. Leevers S.J. Gomez N. Nakielny S. Cohen P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1992; 71: 335-342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar, 5Kyriakis J.M. App H. Zhang X.F. Banerjee P. Brautigan D.L.

Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). A MAP kinase module consists of three kinases (MAPKKK, MAPKK, and MAPK) acting in sequence (7Chang L. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4420) Google Scholar, 8Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3666) Google Scholar, 9Kyriakis J.M. Biochem.

The canonical MAP kinase cascade is found in many signal transduction pathways. Biochemical mechanisms of MAP kinase activation are completely conserved although different MAP kinase modules may couple to different signal transduction pathways in response to different extracellular stimuli. In mammalian cells, the Raf(MAPKKK)-MEK(MAPKK)-ERK(MAPK) pathway has been well characterized in response to a large number of mitogenic stimuli. The c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) also known as the stress-activated protein kinase and the p38 kinase are activated by a kinase cascade very similar to the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway (7Chang L. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4420) Google Scholar, 8Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3666) Google Scholar, 9Kyriakis J.M. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1999; 64: 29-48PubMed Google Scholar). The Raf-MEK-ERK cascade is a linear pathway and shows extremely high specificity. In contrast, the situation is more complex with JNK and p38. Numerous MAPKK and MAPKKK are implicated in activation of JNK or p38. Furthermore, some of the upstream kinases have been implicated in activation of both JNK and p38. MAP kinase modules have been discovered in all eukaryotes and are involved in many physiological responses. For example, in yeast, MAP kinase pathways are involved in regulation of mating pheromone response, sporulation, cell wall integrity, hyperosmotic stress, and pseudohyphal growth (11Gustin M.C. Albertyn J. Alexander M. Davenport K. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1264-1300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Sprague Jr., G.F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2817-2820Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Similarly, MAP kinase pathways have been demonstrated to regulate many developmental programs inCaenorhabditis elegans (13Sternberg P.W. Han M. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 466-472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) and Drosophila(14Rubin G.M. Chang H.C. Karim F. Laverty T. Michaud N.R. Morrison D.K. Rebay I. Tang A. Therrien M. Wassarman D.A. Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1997; 62: 347-352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The biochemical mechanisms of activation of ERK and MEK are well understood. Raf directly phosphorylates and activates MEK via two conserved serine residues in the kinase activation loop of MEK (15Alessi D.R. Saito Y. Campbell D.G. Cohen P. Sithanandam G. Rapp U. Ashworth A. Marshall C.J. Cowley S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1610-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar,16Zheng C.F. Guan K.L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1123-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). These phosphorylations are necessary and sufficient to fully activate MEK. Activated MEK then directly phosphorylates a conserved tyrosine and threonine residue in the kinase activation loop of ERK (17Payne D.M. Rossomando A.J. Martino P. Erickson A.K. Her J.H. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). Again, these phosphorylations are necessary and sufficient for full ERK activation. Similar biochemical mechanisms of activation are employed by the other MAP kinase modules. In contrast, the biochemical mechanism of MAPKKK activation, such as Raf, is not fully understood (6Morrison D.K. Cutler R.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). One of the key events in Raf activation is growth factor-induced association with Ras (18Moodie S.A. Willumsen B.M. Weber M.J. Wolfman A. Science. 1993; 260: 1658-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar, 19Van Aelst L. Barr M. Marcus S. Polverino A. Wigler M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Avruch J. Nature. 1993; 364: 308-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). The interaction of Raf with Ras is a common and necessary feature of all Raf family members, however, is not sufficient for Raf activation. It is conceivable that a common biochemical mechanism (possibly phosphorylation) is involved in Raf activation by Ras. Raf kinase activity is regulated by multiple events, including positive and negative phosphorylations (6Morrison D.K. Cutler R.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Most of the studies performed with C-Raf demonstrated that phosphorylation of Ser338 is essential for Raf activation by Ras, growth factors, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (22Barnard D. Diaz B. Clawson D. Marshall M. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1539-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 23Diaz B. Barnard D. Filson A. MacDonald S. King A. Marshall M. Mol. Cell.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2137-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 25Morrison D.K. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Copeland T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17309-17316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A synergistic activation of Raf was observed when both Ser338 and Tyr341 are phosphorylated. However, the above model (phosphorylation of Ser338 and Tyr341) fails to explain the activation of other Raf family proteins because these two residues are not conserved. For example, the C. elegans lin-45 Raf contains aspartate residues at positions corresponding to Ser338 and Tyr341 of C-Raf. Similarly, residue corresponding to Tyr341 is substituted by an aspartate residue in B-Raf. Recently, we have demonstrated that phosphorylation of Thr598 and Ser601 in B-Raf, which correspond to Thr491 and Ser494 of C-Raf, are essential for B-Raf activation (26Zhang B.H. Guan K.L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5429-5439Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Previous studies have demonstrated that Ser338 of C-Raf can be phosphorylated by Pak2 which is a direct downstream target of Cdc42 and Rac (27King A.J. Sun H. Diaz B. Barnard D. Miao W. Bagrodia S. Marshall M.S. Nature. 1998; 396: 180-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). However, the exact mechanism of Pak in Raf activation is not clear because expression of Pak alone is generally not sufficient to activate Raf or the ERK pathway. Furthermore, expression of active Cdc42 or Rac induces marginal Raf activation while expression of active Ras induces dramatic Raf activation. Interestingly, co-expression of Pak with active Rac can induce significant Raf activation (28Sun H. King A.J. Diaz H.B. Marshall M.S. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 281-284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), indicating a potential role of Cdc42/Rac and Pak in Raf regulation. In this report, we investigated the mechanism of Raf activation by Ras. The effector domain of GTP-bound Ras is directly involved in protein-protein interaction with Raf. Mutations of the effector domain, such as E37G and Y40C, eliminate the ability of Ras to interact with Raf. Such effector domain mutants are also defective in Raf activation. We identified two Ras effector domain mutants, Y32F and T35S, that retain the ability to interact with Raf but are severely compromised in Raf activation. We observed that Rho family GTPases can cooperate with the RasV12Y32F or RasV12T35S to stimulate Raf activation although neither Rho nor Rac/Cdc42 alone can induce significant Raf activation. Furthermore, Pak1 can substitute the effect of Rac or Cdc42, but not Rho. Active Ras stimulates activation of Rac and RhoA while the RasV12Y32F or RasV12T35S mutant fail to stimulate activation of Rac or RhoA. In addition, dominant negative mutant of Rac or Rho can block Raf activation by Ras. Our results demonstrated that the Rho family GTPases play an important role in Raf activation by Ras. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells, COS-7 cells, and HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Transfection was done by LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) methods. Six-well plates were used for all the transfection experiments except where indicated. Vector such as pcDNA3 was used to balance the amount of DNA used for transfection. For stimulation or kinase assay, 24 h after transfection, cells were starved for an additional 12 h by incubating in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.1% serum. For immunoprecipitation, cells were cultured under the normal growth conditions for 48 h after transfection. HA-tagged Ki-Ras and ERK1 cDNA were subcloned into the vector pcDNA3HA. FLAG-Raf-1 is a kind gift from K. Pumiglia (29Pumiglia K. Chow Y.H. Fabian J. Morrison D. Decker S. Jove R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 398-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Ki-Ras mutants, such as RasV12, RasV12Y32F, RasV12T35S, RasV12E37G, and RasV12Y40C, and Raf-1 mutant S338A were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis (Strategene). FLAG-Raf-1CAAX construct was made by adding the C-terminal 18 amino acid residues from the C terminus of Ki-Ras to the C terminus of Raf. The plasmids used for yeast two-hybrid interaction tests were made by polymerase chain reaction and their DNA fragments were subcloned into PVP16 or Plex Ade vector as targets or baits, respectively. The small GTPases (Rac1, Cdc42, and RhoA, all in the Myc-pRK5), Rat-myc-Pak1/pCMV5M (including wild type Pak1, 165–544 deletion mutant, 83–149 deletion mutant, and Pak1K299A), PRK2/pCMV2, PKN1/pRC/CMV, HA-JNK, GST-SEK S220E/T224D, and GST-SEK S220A/T224L mutants are the kind gifts from A. Hall, M. Cobb, L. Quilliam, Y. Ono, and J. Kyriakis. Rac effector domain mutants were obtained by polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis. The GST-PakRBD and GST-Rock RBD were made by subcloning the Rac-binding domain of Pak1 and the Rho-binding domain of Rock1 into pGEX-KG vector (30Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar). The conditions for transfections were as described above. The amounts of DNA used in each transfection were as following: Myc-ERK1 (100 ng), RhoAL63 (50 ng), RacL61/Cdc42L61 (50 ng), Pak1 (200 ng), Pak1 deletion (83) (250 ng), RasV12 (20 ng), and its effector domain mutants (100 ng). The transfected 293, COS-7, and HeLa cells were serum-starved for 12 h before harvesting. Cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer Nonidet P-40 (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin). Cell lysates were incubated with 1 μg of HA antibody (anti-HA) for 1.5 h at 4 °C followed by addition of protein G-Sepharose (Pierce) for 1.5 h. Immunoprecipitated proteins were washed three times with lysis buffer followed by one wash with 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm EDTA. Kinase activities for ERK were measured as described previously (16Zheng C.F. Guan K.L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1123-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). GST-Elk-1 (containing the C-terminal amino acid residues 305–425) expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by glutathione affinity chromatography was used as a substrate in kinase activity assay. HEK 293 cells were co-transfected with 300 ng of HA-JNK and various plasmids, including 250 ng of GST-SEK S220E/T224D or 250 ng of GST-SEK S220A/T224L mutants. The transfected 293 cells were serum-starved for 12 h before being stimulated by 20 μg/ml anisomycin for 30 min. Then the cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 buffer. The procedure of HA-JNK protein immunoprecipitation and kinase assay was similar as the ERK kinase assay. Except the GST- c-Jun was used as substrate in the kinase activity assay. HEK 293 cells were co-transfected with 150 ng of FLAG-Raf-1, FLAG-Raf S338A mutant, and various plasmids, including 50 ng of RasV12 or 100 ng its effector domain mutants, 50 ng of RacL61 or 100 ng its effector domain mutants, 50 ng of Cdc42L61, 50 ng of RhoAL63, 200 ng of Pak1, 500 ng of Pak1K299A, 500 ng of RacN17, 500 ng of RhoAN19, 200 ng of PKN1, 200 ng of PRK2, and 200 ng of ROCK1 plasmid DNA. 24 h following transfection, cells were incubated for 12 h in serum-free medium before harvesting. If stimulated, cells were treated with epidermal growth factor (50 ng/ml) for 5 min. Cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed in about 300 μl of RIPA buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmEGTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm sodium vanadate). After centrifugation, 250-μl supernatants were used for immunoprecipitation with 2 μg of FLAG antibody and 10 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads. Raf kinase activity was assessed by coupled MEK/ERK 1 kinase assays, according to previously described methods in which purified recombinant GST-MEK1, GST-ERK1, and GST-Elk1 were included in the reaction (26Zhang B.H. Guan K.L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5429-5439Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). In this coupled kinase assay, Raf activates MEK1 which activates ERK1 which then phosphorylates Elk1. Phosphorylation of Elk1 (by radioactivity) was quantitated by phosphoimage analysis. 293 cells were transfected for about 48 h, and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Then the cells were lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer containing protease inhibitor (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EGTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Cell extracts were incubated with antibody for 2 h at 4 °C. The proper amount of protein A or protein G beads were added in immunoprecipitation solution, and incubated for an additional hour. Immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation, washed four times with immunoprecipitation buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Protein was detected by immunoblotting with specific antibodies. To determine specific phosphorylation on Raf-1, an immunoblot was conducted by using antibody which specifically recognizes Ser338-phosphorylated Raf (New England Biolab). GST-PakRBD (Rac1-binding domain) and GST-Rock RBD were expressed and purified from E. coli. HEK 293 cells were transfected with wild type Myc-Rac1 (250 ng) and wild type RhoA (250 ng) in the presence of RasV12 (50 ng) or effector domain mutants (100 ng). Cells were lysed in binding buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 5 mmMgCl2, 25 μm ZnCl2, and 0.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin). The cleared cell lysates were incubated with 5 μg of GST-PakRBD or GST-Rock RBD for about 2 h and followed by addition of glutathione-Sepharose beads for an additional 1–2 h. The beads were washed four times with binding buffer, and once with binding buffer without bovine serum albumin. Then the beads were eluted with 10 mm glutathione. The elution was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot with a Rac or RhoA antibody. Protein-protein interactions by the yeast two-hybrid experiments were performed as described (31Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). GTP-bound Ras is a potent activator of Raf. Artificial membrane attachment of Raf can lead to Raf activation (32Leevers S.J. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that membrane targeting of Raf by Ras is a key event for Raf activation. We examined several Ras effector domain mutants in Raf binding and activation (results summarized in TableI). Our results are consistent with the current model that binding is required for Ras to activate Raf. Mutation in the effector domain, such as E37G and Y40C, eliminated Raf binding and simultaneously abolished the ability of Ras to activate Raf (Table I). However, two effector domain mutants Y32F and T35S, which retain the ability to bind Raf, failed to activate Raf. T35S has been previously shown to bind Raf but not phosphoinositide 3-kinase (33Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Khwaja A. Marte B.M. Pappin D. Das P. Waterfield M.D. Ridley A. Downward J. Cell. 1997; 89: 457-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar), while Y32F has not been biochemically tested. We confirmed the interaction between RasV12Y32F and Raf by GST-RafRBD pull-down experiments in vitro (Fig.1 A). RasV12 and RasV12E37G were included as positive and negative controls, respectively. We also examined the activation of ERK by Ras as an in vivo assay for Raf activation. Both RasV12Y32F and RasV12T35S showed a much reduced ability to activate ERK when compared with RasV12 (Fig.1 B). The above data demonstrate that Ras-Raf binding is not sufficient to activate Raf. In addition to association, RasV12 must have additional activity required for Raf activation. Mutation of Y32F or T35S compromises the ability of RasV12 to stimulate Raf. Consistent with our observation, Tamada et al. (34Tamada M. Hu C.D. Kariya K. Okada T. Kataoka T. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2959-2964Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) have previously reported that RasV12V45E effector domain mutant binds Raf but is severely compromised in its ability to activate Raf although the molecular mechanism is unknown (34Tamada M.

Interestingly, T35S is known to be defective in binding and activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase that plays a positive role in the activation of Rac, which is an activator of Pak (33Rodriguez-Viciana P.

Salihuddin H. Zhao Z.S. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar). Since Pak has been implicated in Raf activation (27King A.J. Sun H. Diaz B. Barnard D. Miao W. Bagrodia S. Marshall M.S. Nature. 1998; 396: 180-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 28Sun H. King A.J. Diaz H.B. Marshall M.S. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 281-284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), we tested whether an activated RacL61 mutant can cooperate with the Ras effector domain mutants in Raf activation. RacL61 alone was ineffective to activate Raf (Fig.2 A, lane 2). However, RacL61 could cooperate with RasV12Y32F or RasV12T35S to activate Raf kinase activity (Fig. 2 A, lanes 3 and 5). In contrast, RacL61 was ineffective to cooperate with the RasV12E37G and no cooperation was observed between RacL61 and RasV12Y40C mutant (Fig.2 A, lanes 7–10), which has lost the ability to bind Raf (Table I). The effect of RacL61 was specific and not due to alterations of either Raf or Ras expression (Fig. 2 A, middle andbottom panels). We also determined ERK activity in cells co-transfected with Ras effector domain mutants and RacL61. The ERK activation results are completely consistent with the Raf activation data (Fig. 2, A and B). RacL61 cooperates with the RasV12Y32F and T35S mutant to stimulate ERK activity. Another Rho family member, Cdc42, is also known to activate Pak (35Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z.S. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar). Therefore, the effect of Cdc42 was examined. Our results indicate that Cdc42 acts similarly to Rac in cooperation with the RasV12Y32F and T35S mutants to stimulate ERK activity (Fig. 2 C, lanes 12 and13). We wanted to test whether RhoA, a Rho family member unable to activate Pak, could cooperate with the Ras effector domain mutants in ERK activation. RhoAL63 alone did not activate ERK (Fig.2 C, lane 6). Surprisingly, co-expression of RhoAL63 with the Ras effector domain mutants enhanced ERK activation (Fig. 2 C, lanes 7 and 8). This result indicates that Pak may not be the only downstream effector responsible for Raf activation. Our results demonstrate that the Rho family GTPases play a role in Raf activation by Ras. Activation of ERK in COS-7 and HeLa cells was determined. Co-expression of RacL61 or RhoAL63 cooperates with the RasV12Y32F mutant in stimulation of ERK activity in both HeLa (Fig. 2 D) and COS-7 cells (Fig. 2 E). These results indicate that the functions of the Rho family GTPases in Raf activation are independent of cell type. The role of the Rho family small GTPases in Raf activation was further tested using dominant negative mutants. The dominant negative mutants of RacN17 and RhoAN19 exist constitutively in GDP-bound form. Dominant negative small GTPases can block activation of endogenous GTPases, possibly by sequestering upstream activators. Expression of dominant negative RacN17 or RhoAN19 effectively blocked Raf activation by RasV12 (Fig.3 A). Similarly, activation of ERK by RasV12 is also largely inhibited when dominant negative RacN17 or RhoAN19 was coexpressed (Fig. 3 B). These results provide strong evidence that activation of the endogenous Rho family small GTPases is required for full Raf activation by Ras. To further elucidate the mechanisms of Ras effector domain mutants, we determined activation of co-transfected wild type Rac1 by Ras. The level of GTP-bound Rac was measured by using the RBD of Pak, which specifically interacts with the GTP form, but not the GDP form of Rac. Co-expression of RasV12 caused a detectable increase of Rac-GTP as determined by the GST-PakRBD pull-down experiments (Fig.4 A, lanes 1–3). In contrast, RasV12Y32F and T35S mutants failed to activate wild type Rac in co-transfection experiments (Fig. 4 A, lanes 4 and5). Similar experiments were performed with RhoA. Levels of GTP-bound RhoA were measured by pull-down experiments using the RhoA-binding domain of Rock. The results in Fig. 4 B shows that RasV12 but not RasV12Y32F nor RasV12T35S activated RhoA in co-transfection experiments. These results support that the inability of Ras effector domain mutants to activate Raf may be due to the defect in Rac/Rho activation. Rac also contains an effector domain, which is responsible for the interaction with downstream targets. We examined several Rac effector domain mutants to determine their ability to cooperate with RasV12Y32F. The data in Fig. 4 C indicate that RacL61-F37G and RacL61-Y40C are compromised in the ability to cooperate with RasV12Y32F to stimulate Raf activity (Fig. 4 B, lanes 7 and8). Interesting, similar mutations were defective in stimulating Pak activity (36Westwick J.K. Lambert Q.T. Clark G.J. Symons M. Van Aelst L. Pestell R.G. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1324-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), further indicating a role of Pak in Raf activation. Our results suggest that Ras stimulates Raf by two separate activities: 1) Ras recruits Raf to plasma membrane and 2) Ras activates Rac/Rho. Both of these functions are required for full Raf activation. Based on this hypothesis, one can predict that Rac may be able to activate membrane-associated Raf. Membrane targeting of Raf could partially substitute for the effect of Ras binding and elevate basal Raf kinase activity. We tested the effect of active RacL61 on the activity of RafCAAX, which contains the C-terminal mem"

Our group reported that the DNA helicase activity of Mcm4,6,7 complex, which may be involved in initiation of DNA replication, is inhibited following phosphorylation by Cdk2/cyclin A in vitro. Here, we further examined the interplay between mouse Mcm4,6,7 complex and cyclin-dependent kinases and determined the sites required for the phosphorylation of Mcm4. Six Ser and Thr residues, in all, were required for the phosphorylation. Inhibition of Mcm4,6,7 helicase activity by Cdk2/cyclin A was largely relieved by introducing mutations in these residues of Mcm4. Anti-phosphothreonine antibodies raised against one of these sites reacted with Mcm4 prepared from HeLa cells at mitotic phase but did not bind to those at G1 and G1/S, suggesting that this site is mainly phosphorylated in the mitotic phase. Mcm4,6,7 complex purified from HeLa cells at the mitotic phase exhibited a low level of DNA helicase activity, compared with the complexes prepared from cells at other phases. These results suggest that phosphorylation of Mcm4 at specific sites leads to loss of Mcm4,6,7 DNA helicase activity.

Reinitiation of DNA replication is usually prevented, and only a single round of DNA replication is performed in a cell cycle. This regulation of DNA replication is called replication licensing system and was first proposed in Xenopus egg (1Blow J.J. Laskey R.A. Nature. 1988; 332: 546-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). The system consisted of two components, RLF-B1 and RLF-M. The active component in RLF-M has been identified as an Mcm2–7 protein family (2Kubota Y. Mimura S. Nishimoto S. Takisawa H. Nojima H. Cell. 1995; 81: 601-609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 3Chong J.P. Mahbubani H.M. Khoo C.Y. Blow J.J.

Nature. 1995; 375: 421-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), and it recently became clear that RLF-B is a Cdt1 that plays a role in loading Mcm proteins onto chromatin, together with another protein of Cdc6 (5Maiorano D. Moreau J. Mechali M. Nature. 2000; 404: 622-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 6Nishitani H. Lygerou Z. Nishimoto T. Nurse P.

After the binding to chromatin in the presence of Cdc6, Cdt1, and ORC (originrecognition complex), only Mcm proteins are directly required for DNA replication (8Hua X.H. Newport J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) in the presence of other factors (reviewed in Refs. 9Kelly T.J. Brown G.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 829-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar and 10Takisawa H. Mimura S. Kubota Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 12: 690-696Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Mcm proteins dissociate from chromatin as DNA replication proceeds during S phase and rebind to chromatin during the mitotic phase (11Kearsey S.E. Montgomery S. Labib K. Lindner K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1681-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 12Méndez J. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8602-8612Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). These findings are consistent with the notion that the binding of Mcm proteins to chromatin allows it to be replicated once in a cell cycle. Failure of the regulation of DNA replication can result in overreplication of genomic DNA. Overreplication was observed when Cdc6 protein was overproduced in yeast cells (13Nishitani H. Nurse P.

Genet. 1997; 15: 258-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The kinase inhibits the assembly of preinitiation complex at the replication origin (19Dahmann C. Diffley J.F. Nasmyth K.A. Curr.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the phosphorylation of Cdc6 by cyclin-dependent kinase leads to its degradation (24Jallepalli P.V. Brown G.W. Muzi-Falconi M. Tien D. Kelly T.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2767-2779Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, phosphorylation of Cdc6 by the kinase causes exclusion of the protein from the nucleus (25Saha P.

Thus, the cyclin-dependent protein kinase that plays an essential role in the initiation of DNA replication is critical for the regulation of the replication (reviewed in Ref. 30Jallepalli P.V. Kelly T.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 358-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In addition to cyclin-dependent kinase, geminin (31McGarry T.J. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1998; 93: 1043-1053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar), which accumulates during the S and G2 phases, appears to contribute to the negative regulation of DNA replication by inactivating Cdt1 (7Tada S.

This DNA helicase activity is not processive under standard conditions of DNA helicase assay, but it is processive when a tailed substrate was used for the DNA helicase assay (38Lee J.-K. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 54-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). These results, together with in vivo findings (39Aparicio O.M. Weinstein D.M. Bell S.P.

We reported that the phosphorylation of Mcm4 with Cdk2/cyclin A is associated with the inactivation of DNA helicase of the Mcm4,6,7 complex (50Ishimi Y. Komamura-Kohno Y. You Z. Omori A. Kitagawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16235-16241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The kinase phosphorylated the amino-terminal region of Mcm4 in the complex. In this study, we further characterized the phosphorylation of Mcm4 by determining sites critical for the phosphorylation. In addition, we demonstrated that the phosphorylation results in inhibition of the DNA helicase activity of the Mcm4,6,7 complex. We propose that this phosphorylation reaction contributes to the regulation of DNA replication. Site-directed mutagenesis of the Mcm4 gene was conducted using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The oligonucleotide 5′-GTCCCCGGCATCCGCCCCGAGCCGCC-3′ was used as primer to introduce a change from Ser to Ala at amino acid 7, 5′-GAGGAAAGCAGGTCGGCACCCAATCGGAG-3′ was used for the change at amino acid 32, and 5′-GAAGTGGGGTGAGAGGCGCACCTGTAAGGCAGAGGCC-3′ was used for the change at amino acid 109. The oligonucleotide 5′-ATGTCGGCCCCGGCATCCGCCCCGAGC-3′ was used as the primer to change both Ser-3 and Thr-7 to Ala, 5′-CGACGCGGACGAGTCGCCCCAACCCAGTCCCTTCGAAGTG-3′ was used for the change at amino acid 19, and 5′-CTACTGCCAATGCCCACCGCACCAGGAGCCGACCTG-3′ was used for the change at residue 53. The mutatedMcm4 gene was cloned into a pAcUW31 vector (Pharmingen) in which the Mcm6 gene had been cloned (36You Z. Komamura Y. Ishimi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8003-8015Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). All of the mutated sites in Mcm4 were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. High 5 insect cells were co-infected with recombinant baculovirus expressing proteins Mcm4 and Mcm6 and virus expressing Mcm7 protein (pVL1392 vector). The Mcm4,6,7 complex was purified by nickel column chromatography and then by glycerol gradient centrifugation without histone H3/H4 column chromatography (36You Z. Komamura Y. Ishimi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8003-8015Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). A 17-mer oligonucleotide (5′-GTTTTCCCAGTCACGAC-3′) was labeled at the 5′-end with polynucleotide kinase in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP and then annealed to M13 DNA. The annealed oligomer (5 fmol) was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with Mcm4,6,7 complex in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 10 mm ATP, and 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The reaction was terminated by adding 0.2% SDS, and an aliquot was electrophoresed on a 12% acrylamide gel in Tris borate/EDTA. The labeled oligomer in the gel was detected by using a Bio-Image analyzer (FLA2000, Fuji). The Mcm4,6,7 complexes were incubated with various amounts of Cdk2/cyclin A complex at 37 °C for 30 min in a 20-μl reaction mixture consisting of 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 30 mm NaCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm ATP, and 0.01% Triton X-100 in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. The phosphorylated proteins were digested with lysyl endopeptidase (2 μg/ml) (Wako) for 1 h at 37 °C in the presence of 0.1% SDS, and the peptides were analyzed in 15–25% polyacrylamide gel containing SDS. To examine the effect of phosphorylation on the DNA helicase activity of the Mcm4,6,7 complex, Cdk2/cyclin A was added to the reaction mixture from the start of the DNA helicase assay, and the displaced oligonucleotide was analyzed as described above. Antiserum against phosphothreonine at amino acid 19 of mouse Mcm4 was obtained by immunizing rabbits with a synthetic peptide of NH2-SRRGRV(phospho-T)PTQSLRSEC-COOH conjugated with keyhole limpet at the carboxyl terminus. Anti-phosphothreonine antibodies were first purified by phosphopeptide column chromatography. The serum was loaded onto a phosphopeptide column that had been prepared by fixing the peptide with CNBr-activated Sepharose, and antibodies were eluted with 0.1 m glycine (pH 2.5) and 0.15m NaCl. The eluted solution was neutralized and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline. Then, the purified antibodies were loaded onto a non-phosphopeptide column. The pass-through fraction was concentrated and used as anti-phosphothreonine antibodies. The specificity of binding of the purified antibodies was confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Human Cdk2/cyclin A was purified as reported (50Ishimi Y. Komamura-Kohno Y. You Z. Omori A. Kitagawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16235-16241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and the protein concentration of the purified protein was 150 μg/ml. Human Cdc2 (His)/cyclin B (Myc) was purified from High 5 cells co-infected with baculoviruses containing these two genes by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity column chromatography (these viruses were kindly provided by R. A. Laskey). The concentration of the kinase activity of the purified Cdc2/cyclin B was similar to that of the Cdk2/cyclin A. The kinase activity was measured by the ability that phosphorylates H1 histone as reported (50Ishimi Y. Komamura-Kohno Y. You Z. Omori A. Kitagawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16235-16241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were cultured in minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% calf serum at 37 °C. The cells were synchronized at G2/M by adding nocodazole at 50 ng/ml for 19 h. HeLa cells at G1/S phase were prepared by incubating them with 1 mmhydroxyurea for 18 h. For G1 synchronization, the following procedures were employed. HeLa cells were treated with 1 mm hydroxyurea for 11 h. After being washed, the cells were incubated in the presence of nocodazole for 12 h. Mitotic cells were detached from the surface by shaking the bottle, and the collected cells were cultured for 6 h without nocodazole. The cellular proteins were fractionated into chromatin-unbound and chromatin-bound forms (50Ishimi Y. Komamura-Kohno Y. You Z. Omori A. Kitagawa M. J. Biol.

Briefly, the cells were suspended with CSK buffer (10 mmPipes, pH 6.8, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 1 mm ATP at the concentration of 2–4 × 107cells/ml. The cells were placed on ice for 15 min, and soluble proteins were recovered after centrifugation and used as the chromatin-unbound fraction. The Mcm proteins in the chromatin-unbound form were purified by histone-Sepharose column chromatography and then by glycerol gradient centrifugation (34Ishimi Y. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 8369-8375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Usually, 1–2 × 108cells were used for the purification. An Mcm4,6,7 complex purified from HeLa cells at the G2/M phase was treated with 12 units of lambda protein phosphatase (New England BioLabs) for 30 min at 30 °C under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer. By comparing phosphorylation of wild-type Mcm4 with mutated Mcm4 in which 35 or 112 amino acids from the amino terminus were removed, we previously determined that Cdk2/cyclin A mainly phosphorylates the amino-terminal region of Mcm4 in mouse Mcm4,6,7 complex (50Ishimi Y. Komamura-Kohno Y. You Z. Omori A. Kitagawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16235-16241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To further analyze phosphorylation in the amino-terminal region of Mcm4, we treated the phosphorylated Mcm4,6,7 proteins with lysyl endopeptidase, which digests lysine at amino acid 122 of Mcm4 (Fig. 1 B; see also Fig.2 A). The amino-terminal peptide of Mcm4 is the longest one among the peptides generated from Mcm proteins. As the amount of Cdk2/cyclin A increased in the reaction mixture containing the wild-type complex, the radioactivity incorporated into the amino-terminal peptide of Mcm4 increased, and the phosphorylated bands shifted upward in the gel. A great loss of incorporation of phosphate into this region of Mcm4 was observed in the mutant Mcm4,6,7 complex in which 35 amino acids from the amino terminus of Mcm4 were deleted (87 amino acids in total). The results indicate that these 35 amino acids play an important role in phosphorylation with Cdk2/cyclin A. However, we showed that deletion of up to 112 amino acids from the amino terminus was required for the almost complete loss of phosphorylation in Mcm4 (50Ishimi Y. Komamura-Kohno Y. You Z. Omori A. Kitagawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16235-16241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The DNA helicase activity of these mutant Mcm4,6,7 complexes was examined (Fig. 1 A). Deletion of 35 amino acids resulted in a 5-fold reduction in the DNA helicase activity of the Mcm4,6,7 complex, and the removal of 112 amino acids resulted in an ∼10-fold reduction. Thus, the amino-terminal portion of Mcm4 is required for the DNA helicase activity of the mouse Mcm4,6,7 complex. In contrast, single-stranded DNA-dependent ATPase activity was not affected by the deletion of this portion (data not shown).Figure 2Amino acid residues in the amino-terminal region of mouse Mcm4 that were required for phosphorylation by Cdk2/cyclin A. A, amino acid sequence in the amino-terminal region of Mcm4 is shown; three consensus sites of cyclin-dependent kinase, two SerPro(SP) sites, and one ThrPro(TP) site that were mutated are underlined. B, list of mutant Mcm4 is shown. Site-directed mutagenesis of SerPro(SP) or ThrPro(TP) to AlaPro(AP) in this region of Mcm4 was performed, and six kinds of mutant Mcm4 were prepared. C,the mutant Mcm4,6,7 complexes (45 ng) containing the mutated and wild-type Mcm4 were phosphorylated with Cdk2/cyclin A (0.4, 7.5, and 37 ng), and the amino-terminal peptide of Mcm4 was analyzed after digestion with lysyl endopeptidase. The number of phosphates incorporated into the peptide is shown at the bottom.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fig.2 A shows the amino acid sequence in the amino-terminal region of mouse Mcm4. There are six SerPro(SP) and five ThrPro(TP) sites (11 in total) that are potentially phosphorylated by the cyclin-dependent kinases. First, we mutated all three consensus sites (amino acids 7, 32, and 109) of the kinase to alanine in this region and prepared a mutant Mcm4,6,7 complex containing the mutagenized Mcm4 (Fig. 2 B). After phosphorylating the mutant complex with Cdk2/cyclin A, proteins in the complexes were digested with lysyl endopeptidase to analyze phosphorylation in the amino-terminal region of Mcm4 (Fig. 2 C). As the amounts of Cdk2/cyclin A in the reaction increased, the incorporated radioactivity enhanced and the phosphorylated bands shifted upward; these changes were similar to those in the wild-type complex. We introduced a fourth mutation at either amino acid 3, 19, or 53 in the triple mutant of Mcm4 (7/32/109m) and prepared three more mutant Mcm4,6,7 complexes. The phosphorylation of the two complexes containing Mcm4 mutated at 3/7/32/109 and 7/19/32/109 was similar to that of wild-type complex. In the complex containing Mcm4 mutated at 7/32/53/109, the slowest migrating band was not detected, but the incorporation of32P was slightly increased. When the Mcm4,6,7 complex containing Mcm4 mutated at five sites (7/19/32/53/109) was phosphorylated with the kinase, however, only a low level of phosphorylation was observed. The phosphorylation of a mutant complex containing Mcm4 mutated at six sites (3/7/19/32/53/109) showed almost no phosphorylation in this region of Mcm4. Thus, these three SerPro(SP) (3, 32, and 53) and three ThrPro(TP) (7, 19, and 109) sites are required for phosphorylation of Mcm4 in Mcm4,6,7 complex by Cdk2/cyclin A. The results also suggest that three sites (3, 19, and 53) among them play an important role in the phosphorylation. We also examined the phosphorylation of Mcm4 by Cdc2/cyclin B using the same set of mutant complexes. As shown in Fig.3, the wild-type and mutant Mcm4,6,7 complexes were incubated with Cdc2/cyclin B, and the extent of phosphorylation was examined by measuring the gel-mobility shift of Mcm4. Mcm4 bands that shifted upward were detected in the presence of larger amounts of the kinase when the wild-type complex or the triple mutant complex (7/32/109m) was phosphorylated. Such a mobility-shifted band appeared to be decreased in the four kinds of complexes (3/7/32/109m, 7/19/32/109m, 7/32/53/109m, and 7/19/32/53/109m). In the mutant 3/7/19/32/53/109m, such shifted bands were not detected. Thus, the six mutated sites are required for phosphorylation of Mcm4 by Cdc2/cyclin B in the Mcm4,6,7 complex. The results appear to be essentially similar to those obtained with Cdk2/cyclin A. We reported that phosphorylation of Mcm4 in human and mouse Mcm4,6,7 complex is associated with the inhibition of Mcm4,6,7 helicase activity (50Ishimi Y. Komamura-Kohno Y. You Z. Omori A. Kitagawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16235-16241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4). To further understand this relationship, the mutant Mcm4,6,7 complex containing six mutations in Mcm4 (3/7/19/32/53/109m), which had become resistant to phosphorylation by Cdk2/cyclin A (Fig. 2), was examined for DNA helicase activity in the presence of Cdk2/cyclin A (Fig. 4). The mutant complex was much more resistant to the inhibition of DNA helicase activity by the kinase. This result indicates that the phosphorylation of these six amino acids in Mcm4 is mainly responsible for the inhibition of Mcm4,6,7 helicase by the kinase. We do not know why the DNA helicase activity of the mutant complex containing six mutations in Mcm4 is slightly inhibited by the kinase. It is possible that phosphorylation at other sites in Mcm4 or in Mcm6 are involved. Mcm4 is heavily phosphorylated at the mitotic phase of the cell cycle. It has been shown using a temperature-sensitive mutant of Cdc2 kinase that Cdc2/cyclin B complex is mainly responsible for the phosphorylation of Mcm4 in mouse FM3A cells (47Fujita M. Yamada C. Tsurumi T. Hanaoka F. Matsuzawa K. Inagaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17095-17101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We synchronized HeLa cells at G2/M by treating them with nocodazole, and we purified Mcm4,6,7 complex from the cells. Chromatin-unbound proteins were prepared from the cells, and Mcm4,6,7 complex was purified from this fraction by histone-Sepharose column chromatography and then by glycerol gradient centrifugation. The SDS-polyacrylamide gel used for electrophoresis of the purified Mcm4,6,7 complex is shown in Fig.5 A. Mcm4 was shifted upward and was detected at a position between Mcm2 and Mcm6 as a broad band, which was also determined by immunoblotting analysis using anti-Mcm4 antibodies (data not shown). Phosphatase treatment of the purified mitotic Mcm4,6,7 complex resulted in a mobility shift of Mcm4 protein from these positions to almost the same position as the Mcm4 purified from logarithmically growing HeLa cells, indicating that phosphorylation causes mobility-shift of Mcm4. The DNA helicase activity of the Mcm4,6,7 complex prepared from the cells at G2/M phase was measured (Fig. 5 B). As compared with the Mcm4,6,7 complex that was purified from logarithmically growing HeLa cells, the Mcm4,6,7 complex purified from the cells at G2/M exhibited a much lower level of DNA helicase activity. These results indicate that phosphorylation of Mcm4 at higher level is associated with the inhibition of the DNA helicase activity of the purified Mcm4,6,7 complex. We measured DNA helicase activity of the Mcm4,6,7 complex prepared from HeLa cells at G2/M after treatment with phosphatase, but the activity was not enhanced by the treatment (data not shown). It is possible that irreversible structural change in the Mcm4,6,7 hexamer may occur by the phosphorylation of Mcm4. To further understand the relationship between the phosphorylation of Mcm4 and the level of Mcm4,6,7 helicase activity, we raised anti-phospho antibodies against Thr at amino acid 19 of Mcm4, which plays a role in the phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent kinase in vitro (Figs. 2 and 3). Mcm proteins were purified from HeLa cells synchronized at various stages of the cell cycle, and Mcm4 in the purified fraction was examined for binding with the anti-phosphothreonine antibodies. As shown in Fig.6 A, the anti-phosphothreonine antibodies reacted with Mcm4 from HeLa cells at the mitotic phase but did not react with Mcm4 from cells at G1 and G1/S, indicating that phosphorylation of Thr-19 mainly occurs at the G2/M in HeLa cells. The Mcm4,6,7 complex purified from these synchronized HeLa cells was examined for DNA helicase activity (Fig. 6 B). Hexameric protein complex formation of the purified Mcm4,6,7 complex was confirmed by native gel electrophoresis. Compared with the Mcm4,6,7 complex from cells in G1 and G1/S, the complex from cells in G2/M showed much weaker activity. These results show a correlation between phosphorylation at amino acid 19 of Mcm4 and the lowered level of DNA helicase activity of the purified Mcm4,6,7 complex. In this study, we determined the sites in Mcm4 that are required for phosphorylation by the cyclin-dependent kinases in vitro. One of these sites was indeed phosphorylated in vivo, as was determined by using anti-phosphothreonine antibodies. We demonstrated that the phosphorylation of specific sites in the amino-terminal region of Mcm4 leads to inactivation of Mcm4,6,7 helicase. The correlation between the Mcm4 phosphorylation and the lowered level of DNA helicase activity was also observed when DNA helicase activity was compared among Mcm4,6,7 complexes prepared from HeLa cells at various stages of the cell cycle. These results suggest that one of the roles of the Mcm4 phosphorylation by the cyclin-dependent kinase is to inactivate the DNA helicase activity of the Mcm4,6,7 complex that is probably involved in DNA replication in vivo. Mcm proteins are phosphorylated in vivo. The mobility in SDS gel of the Mcm4 that was prepared from HeLa cells at the G2/M was greatly retarded, suggesting that several sites in Mcm4 are phosphorylated at G2/M in vivo. Fujitaet al. (47Fujita M. Yamada C. Tsurumi T. Hanaoka F. Matsuzawa K. Inagaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17095-17101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) have shown that Cdc2/cyclin B is mainly responsible for the phosphorylation of Mcm4 at the G2/M in mouse FM3A cells. In Xenopus, phosphorylation of Mcm4 by the cyclin-dependent kinase has been reported by several groups (45Coue M. Kearsey S.E. Mechali M.

Hendrickson et al. (46Hendrickson M. Madine M. Dalton S. Gautier J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12223-12228Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) have shown that Cdc2/cyclin B is mainly responsible for the phosphorylation of Mcm4 at the mitotic phase, and Pereverzeva et al., (49Pereverzeva I. Whitmire E. Khan B. Coue M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3667-3676Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) have indicated that a kinase(s) in addition to Cdc2/cyclin B are involved in the phosphorylation. The function of the Mcm4 phosphorylation is not clear, but it may inhibit the binding of Mcm complexes to chromatin (46Hendrickson M. Madine M. Dalton S. Gautier J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12223-12228Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 48Findeisen M. El-Denary M. Kapitza T. Graf R. Strausfeld U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 415-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Conversely, it is suggested that the phosphorylation of Mcm4 at mitotic phase is required for binding of the Mcm complex to chromatin at the G1 phase (49Pereverzeva I. Whitmire E. Khan B. Coue M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3667-3676Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Here, we suggested another function of the Mcm4 phosphorylation. We determined the specific sites in the amino-terminal region of mouse Mcm4 that are required for phosphorylation by Cdk2/cyclin A in vitro. The same sites in Mcm4 appeared to be required for the phosphorylation by Cdc2/cyclin Bin vitro, suggesting that both Cdk2/cyclin A and Cdc2/cyclin B have similar specificity of substrate recognition. In addition to three consensus sites for these kinases in the amino-terminal region of Mcm4, we identified two sites of SerPro(SP) and one site of ThrPro(TP) in this region that are required for the phosphorylation with Cdk2/cyclin A and Cdc2/cyclin B. One of these sites (Thr-19) was phosphorylated mainly at the G2/M phase in human HeLa cells, which was determined by using anti-phosphothreonine antibodies. It is tempting to speculate that this site is phosphorylated by Cdc2/cyclin B at G2/M in vivo, but further experiments are needed to test this notion. The anti-phosphothreonine would be useful to analyze the mechanism of the Mcm4 phosphorylation. Mcm proteins are present in cells as a chromatin-bound form as well as an unbound form, and at G2/M phase, almost all of the Mcm proteins are present as the unbound form. They appear to be present mainly as a heterohexameric Mcm2–7 complex either in the chromatin-bound form (51Fujita M. Kiyono T. Hayashi Y. Ishibashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10928-10935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) or the unbound form (52Richter A. Knippers R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 136-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We purified the Mcm4,6,7 complex from the chromatin-unbound fraction at various stages of the HeLa cell cycle. We used a histone-Sepharose column chromatography by which Mcm2, Mcm3, and Mcm5 proteins, which can be inhibitory to Mcm4,6,7 helicase activity, are removed (35Ishimi Y. Komamura Y. You Z. Kimura H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8369-8375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 37Lee J.-K. Hurwitz J. J. Biol.

Biol. 2000; 300: 421-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Then, we compared the DNA helicase activity of these Mcm4,6,7 complexes. The activity of the complex prepared from cells at the G2/M phase was much lower than that prepared from cells in other phases (Figs. 5 and 6). In vitro, phosphorylation of Mcm4 by Cdk2/cyclin A resulted in inhibition of the DNA helicase activity of the mouse Mcm4,6,7 complex (Fig. 4). This inhibition by Cdk2/cyclin A was largely rescued by changing the specific sites in the amino-terminal region of Mcm4 that were required for phosphorylation by Cdk2/cyclin A. These results indicate that phosphorylation at specific sites of Mcm4 by cyclin-dependent kinases can lead to inhibition of the Mcm4,6,7 helicase activity. Related to this point, the Mcm4 bound to chromatin at S phase is more phosphorylated than the protein in unbound form in Xenopus (45Coue M. Kearsey S.E. Mechali M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1085-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and in HeLa cells (47Fujita M. Yamada C. Tsurumi T. Hanaoka F. Matsuzawa K. Inagaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17095-17101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The functional significance of the phosphorylation of the chromatin-bound Mcm4 at S phase remains to be determined. The ATP binding sites in Mcm4,6,7 proteins appear to play a distinct role in the DNA helicase activity of the Mcm4,6,7 hexamer (36You Z. Komamura Y. Ishimi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8003-8015Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Namely, it was suggested that the ATP binding of Mcm6 is essential for DNA helicase activity but not for single-stranded DNA-dependent ATPase activity and that the ATP binding site of Mcm4 contributes to the binding of Mcm4,6,7 complex to single-stranded DNA. We reported that phosphorylation of Mcm4 by Cdk2/cyclin A moderately affects the single-stranded DNA binding activity (50Ishimi Y. Komamura-Kohno Y. You Z. Omori A. Kitagawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16235-16241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal region of Mcm4 was required for the DNA helicase activity of the Mcm4,6,7 complex (Fig. 1 A). In this region of Mcm4, there are multiple SerPro(SP) sites that could also act as a binding motif of double-stranded DNA (54Suzuki M. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 207: 61-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, we consider that this region plays a role in the interaction with DNA during DNA helicase action, and the phosphorylation of Mcm4 by the cyclin-dependent kinase perturbs the interaction to inactivate the DNA helicase activity of the Mcm4,6,7 complex. Several proteins are involved in the regulation of DNA replication, which occurs once in a cell cycle. The cyclin-dependent kinase plays a central role in the regulation. One important target of the kinase is Cdc6 protein, and the phosphorylation causes degradation or nuclear export of Cdc6 (24Jallepalli P.V. Brown G.W. Muzi-Falconi M. Tien D. Kelly T.J.

However, a significant fraction of Cdc6 protein is present on chromatin throughout the cell cycle of human cells (12Méndez J. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8602-8612Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar, 55Coverley D. Pelizon C. Trewick S. Laskey R.A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1929-1938Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another important substrate of the cyclin-dependent kinase may be Mcm proteins. The kinase may play a role in the regulation of DNA replication by preventing the loading of Mcm proteins onto chromatin during the S and G2/M phases (19Dahmann C. Diffley J.F. Nasmyth K.A. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1257-1269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 22Tanaka T. Knapp D. Nasmyth K.

It is possible that the phosphorylation of Mcm4 at the sites determined here is involved in the detachment of Mcm proteins from chromatin. In this paper, we have suggested another role for the phosphorylation of Mcm4 by cyclin-dependent kinase in the regulation of DNA replication. Namely, Mcm4,6,7 helicase activity may be a target for the negative regulation by the cyclin-dependent kinase. We thank R. A. Laskey for providing recombinant baculoviruses for preparing cyclin-dependent kinases and H. Kimura for providing anti-Mcm4 antibodies."

One SNP mapping to the N-terminal region of the seven-transmembrane structure of MOR has already been shown to alter the binding affinity for β-endorphin (8Bond C. LaForge K.S. Tian M.T. Melia D. Zhang S.W. Borg L. Gong J.H. Schluger J. Strong J.A. Leal S.M. Tischfield J.A. Kreek M.J. Yu L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Psych. 1999; 4: 476-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that by analyzing the effect of additional polymorphisms on the complex signaling behavior of MOR, we might gain further clues as to the molecular basis of opioid drug response. Opioid receptors are functionally dynamic, seven-transmembrane-spanning proteins known to transmit signals via the GTP-binding proteins, Gi/Go. However, they cannot be understood adequately in terms of acute G protein activation alone. Activation of MOR also results in long term changes associated with receptor phosphorylation, internalization, and alterations in gene expression (1Nestler E.J. Aghajanian G.K. Science. 1997; 278: 58-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar). Recently, a direct interaction between the ubiquitous calcium-sensitive regulatory protein calmodulin (CaM) and the third intracellular (i3) loop of MOR has been demonstrated (11Wang D.X. Sadée W. Quillan J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22081-22088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The importance of the i3 loop to G protein coupling (12Wade S.M. Scribner M.K. Dalman H.M. Taylor J.M. Neubig R.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 351-358PubMed Google Scholar) and CaM binding (11Wang D.X. Sadée W. Quillan J.M. J. Biol.

Hollt V. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 328-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and recent observations that this region regulates spontaneous basal G protein coupling (11Wang D.X. Sadée W.

J. 2000; 348: 531-537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) all strengthen the rationale for examining i3 loop polymorphisms. A range of functional consequences could emanate from alterations in the i3 loop. At least three allelic, nonsynonymous SNPs that alter the MOR-i3 loop have so far been identified in single individuals, leading to the human variants R260H-, R265H-, and S268P-MOR (8Bond C. LaForge K.S. Tian M.T. Melia D. Zhang S.W. Borg L. Gong J.H. Schluger J. Strong J.A. Leal S.M. Tischfield J.A. Kreek M.J. Yu L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Genet. 2000; 9: 2895-2908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The allele frequency of these three sporadic variants is unknown. In this study we have genotyped exon 3 of the hMOR gene in 252 subjects (Coriell collection) to obtain more information on allele frequency and discover any further MOR variants. Examination of S268P-MOR had already revealed differences in G protein coupling efficiency and in desensitization kinetics, differences that could stem from structural changes induced by proline insertion and loss of the CaM-kinase II phosphorylation site at Ser268 (14Koch T. Kroslak T. Averbeck M. Mayer P. Schroder H. Raulf E. Hollt V. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 328-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Moreover, Befort et al. (16Befort K. Filliol D. Decaillot F.M. Gaveriaux-Ruff C. Hoehe M.R. Kieffer B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3130-3137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) have proposed that the S268P substitution significantly impaired agonist-stimulated G protein coupling of MOR, a finding that we have re-examined in the present study. Recently, a significant level of basal G protein coupling has been demonstrated for MOR (11Wang D.X. Sadée W. Quillan J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22081-22088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 13Wang D.X. Surratt C.K. Sadée W. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 763-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 15Burford N.T. Wang D. Sadée W. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 531-537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Basal signaling is observable even at relatively low receptor concentrations (∼150 fmol of MOR/mg protein) (17Wang D.X. Raehal K.M. Bilsky E.J. Sadée W. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 1590-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), indicating that it could be physiologically relevant. Basal MOR coupling was shown to increase after prolonged morphine stimulation (11Wang D.X. Sadée W. Quillan J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22081-22088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 13Wang D.X. Surratt C.K. Sadée W. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 763-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 18Wang Z. Bilsky E.J. Porreca F. Sadée W. Life Sci. 1994; 54: L339-L350Google Scholar), a paradoxical finding that has been confirmed by Liu and Prather (19Liu J.G. Prather P.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). We have recently identified a series of neutral antagonists and inverse agonists at MOR in tissue culture (17Wang D.X. Raehal K.M. Bilsky E.J. Sadée W. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 1590-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Moreover, neutral antagonists of MOR (antagonists that do not affect basal signaling) were shown to elicit substantially less withdrawal jumping than inverse agonists (antagonists that suppress basal signaling) in a mouse model of morphine dependence (17Wang D.X. Raehal K.M. Bilsky E.J. Sadée W. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 1590-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 20Bilsky E.J. Bernstein R.N. Wang Z.J. Sadée W. Porreca F. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 277: 484-490PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that basal signaling activity of MOR plays a key role in narcotic dependence. On the other hand, CaM appears to compete with G protein coupling at the i3 loop and regulates basal MOR-G protein coupling (11Wang D.X. Sadée W. Quillan J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22081-22088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 13Wang D.X. Surratt C.K. Sadée W. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 763-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Hence, polymorphisms mapping to the i3 loop of MOR might change the balance between G protein coupling, basal and agonist-stimulated, and CaM interactions. This could affect gene transcription, shown to play a role in opioid dependence (1Nestler E.J. Aghajanian G.K. Science. 1997; 278: 58-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar). For example, up-regulation of the cAMP second messenger system by opioid agonists, considered a biochemical correlate of dependence, is associated with altered transcription of adenylyl cyclases and other components of this signaling pathway (1Nestler E.J. Aghajanian G.K. Science. 1997; 278: 58-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar, 21Maldonado R. Blendy J.A. Tzavara E. Gass P. Roques B.P. Hanoune J. Schutz G. Science. 1996; 273: 657-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have determined functional changes in MOR signal transduction resulting from three previously established SNPs mapping to the i3 loop. For comparison, we have also included a mutant MOR with a K273A substitution in the i3 loop, which disrupts CaM binding to the receptor and leads to elevated basal G protein coupling (11Wang D.X. Sadée W. Quillan J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22081-22088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The results reveal profound changes in G protein coupling, CaM binding, or both, introduced by each of the three i3 loop SNPs examined. Stable human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) cell lines expressing N-terminal FLAG-tagged wild type and R260H-, R265H-, S268P-, and K273A-MOR were maintained as described (11Wang D.X. Sadée W. Quillan J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22081-22088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). For morphine pretreatment, the cells were incubated with morphine (1 μm) for 18 h. Then the cells were extensively washed with phosphate-buffered saline to remove the agonist. N-terminal FLAG-tagged MOR and K273A-MOR were constructed as described (11Wang D.X. Sadée W. Quillan J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22081-22088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Polymorphic variants R260H-, R265H-, and S268P-MOR were constructed using the QuickChangeTMsite-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and confirmed by DNA sequencing. Plasmids were transfected into HEK 293 cells with Superfect reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and stable cell lines were selected as described (22Arden J.R. Segredo F. Wang Z.J. Lameh J. Sadée W. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1636-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Peptides corresponding to the entire i3 loop of the hMOR wild type receptor (residues 256–286) and i3 loop with R260H, R265H, and S268P substitutions were prepared and purified by high pressure liquid chromatography as described (11Wang D.X. Sadée W. Quillan J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22081-22088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Gel mobility shift assays were performed using 12% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described (11Wang D.X. Sadée W. Quillan J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22081-22088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Immunopurification of FLAG-tagged human wild type and R260H-, R265H-, and S268P-hMOR receptors, binding to CaM gels, and detection by Western blots were done as described (11Wang D.X. Sadée W. Quillan J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22081-22088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). [35S]GTPγS binding in cell membranes was performed as described (11Wang D.X. Sadée W. Quillan J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22081-22088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 23Burford N.T. Tolbert L.M. Sadée W. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 342: 123-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). For inverse agonist experiments, the cell membranes (20 μg protein) were incubated with β-CNA (1 μm) and [35S]GTPγS in 500 μl of assay buffer at 30 °C for 20 min as described (13Wang D.X. Surratt C.K. Sadée W. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 763-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The plasma membranes were prepared, CaM was extracted from the plasma membrane fractions, and the CaM levels were determined enzymatically with CaM-dependent phosphodiesterase activity using [3H]cAMP as described (11Wang D.X. Sadée W. Quillan J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22081-22088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Cells cultured in 24-well plates for 3–4 days were labeled with 1 μCi/ml [2,8-3H]adenine (1.11 TBq/mmol; ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) for 16 h, washed, and incubated with 100 μm forskolin in the presence or the absence of drugs at 37 °C for 30 min. Then [3H]cAMP was purified as described (24Wong Y.H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 238: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The results are expressed as the ratios of [3H]cAMP to total [3H]ATP, [3H]ADP, and [3H]cAMP pools. For morphine pretreatment experiments, cells were incubated with 1 μmmorphine for 18 h and labeled with 2 μCi/ml [3H]adenine during the last 2 h of the incubation before washing, followed by incubation with forskolin. Using genomic DNA from 252 individuals in the Coriell collection, exon 3 of MOR was first amplified by PCR (Applied Biosystems Gene Amp PCR System 9700). The 20-μl reaction mixture contained 20 μm of each primer (forward primer, 5′ TGGCAGTATTAACACCTTATGACA; reverse primer, 5′ GGTGGTCTCTAGTGTTCTGACGA), and 50 ng of DNA was denatured at 95 °C for 10 min and then cycled at 94 °C for 20 s (denaturation), 61 °C for 20 s (annealing), and 72 °C for 45 s (extension). The annealing temperature decreased ½ of a degree each cycle for 10 cycles until it was at 56 °C, when it was cycled 25 more times. Then it was completely extended by incubation at 72 °C for 10 min, and the mixture was put on 4 °C holding temperature. The PCR products were then cleaned using 2 units of shrimp alkaline phosphatase and 2 units of exonuclease I in a PCR cycler at 37 °C for 60 min and then at 95 °C for 15 min. The cleaned PCR products were then sequenced using an Applied Biosystems 3700 DNA analyzer (with a 3700 POP-6 polymer matrix). The resulting sequences were analyzed using Sequencer 4.0. The effects of sequence variation in the MOR-i3 loop were examined by incubating CaM with peptides derived from the polymorphic i3 loop sequences. Formation of peptide-CaM complexes gave rise to a new band on polyacrylamide gels with lower electrophoretic mobility, corresponding to the expected increase in molecular mass of a 1:1 CaM i3 loop peptide complex (Fig. 1) (11Wang D.X. Sadée W. Quillan J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22081-22088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The intensity of the shifted band was maximal when CaM was incubated with an equimolar concentration wild type synthetic peptide (in the presence of Ca2+, 0.2–2 mm) and did not further increase at a 1:10 ratio. Substitution of Arg260with histidine in the i3 loop peptide only marginally reduced the intensity of the complex band compared with wild type peptide (Fig. 1). However, substitutions equivalent to R265H and S268P markedly reduced the CaM mobility shift, especially at a peptide/CaM molar ratio of 1:1 (Fig. 1). A 10-fold increase in the concentration of peptides derived from R265H- and S268P-MOR significantly increased the intensity of the shifted band. These results reflect similar observations reported previously by Wang et al. (11Wang D.X. Sadée W. Quillan J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22081-22088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) for CaM interactions with peptides representing the i3 loop of wild type MOR and the CaM-binding deficient mutant K273A-MOR. In the absence of Ca2+, no shift in the mobility of CaM was observed with any of the four peptides tested. MOR interactions with CaM were also examined with full-length receptors purified from transfected HEK cells (11Wang D.X. Sadée W. Quillan J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22081-22088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Three FLAG epitope-tagged i3 loop MOR variants were constructed and compared with the wild type FLAG-tagged receptor for retention on CaM affinity gels (Fig.2). Retention of immunopurified FLAG-tagged MOR on the CaM affinity gels was similar to the pattern observed with synthetic peptides in that both the wild type and the R260H variant receptors bound considerably better than the R265H and S268P variants. This indicates that the R265H and S268P substitutions reduce the degree of interaction with CaM even when full-length receptor protein is used. The ability of MOR variants to interact directly with CaM was shown to be correlated with morphine-induced depletion of CaM from plasma membranes (11Wang D.X. Sadée W. Quillan J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22081-22088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 13Wang D.X. Surratt C.K. Sadée W. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 763-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Morphine treatment (1 μm, 15 min) significantly reduced CaM content in the plasma membrane of wild type MOR transfected cells (to 68 ± 8% of control, p < 0.01, ttest). Morphine stimulation also caused detectable CaM release from plasma membranes of R260H-MOR transfected cells, reducing the CaM content to 85 ± 12% of control (p < 0.05,n = 6, t test). In contrast, morphine had no detectable effect on CaM content in plasma membranes expressing the R265H- and S268P-MOR variants (90 ± 18% of control for R265H-MOR, p > 0.05; 110 ± 30% of control for S268P-MOR, p > 0.05, n = 6,t test). [35S]GTPγS binding to cell membranes served as a measure of activation of G proteins. Peptides derived from the coupling domains of the receptor can be expected to bind directly to G proteins and affect [35S]GTPγS binding. Incubation of i3 loop peptides with HEK293 cell membranes (not expressing MOR) increased [35S]GTPγS binding activity in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.3 a). Among the four i3 loop peptides tested, wild type i3 loop peptide was most efficacious in eliciting G protein coupling, followed by the S268P, R265H, and R260H mutant peptides. On the other hand, the binding of i3 loop peptides to G protein is expected to inhibit the more efficient agonist-stimulated G protein coupling. Shown in Fig. 3 b, preincubation of HEK-MOR membranes for 30 min with wild type and S268P i3 loop peptide decreased morphine-activated [35S]GTPγS binding, because the peptides compete with MOR for binding to G protein. However, no inhibition was observed with R260H and R265H peptides (Fig.3 b). These results indicate that R260H and R265H substitutions in the peptides impair binding to G proteins and suggest that binding to CaM and G proteins are mediated by different determinants in the i3 loop-derived peptides. However, the structure of the peptides may differ from that present in the intact receptor; therefore, these results do not necessarily reflect the coupling efficiency of the intact receptors. MOR has been shown to display a significant level of basal G protein coupling in plasma membranes (11Wang D.X. Sadée W. Quillan J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22081-22088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The effect of i3 loop variation on G protein coupling by MOR was examined by determining GTPγS binding in cell membranes (TableI). The results were compared with K273A-MOR constructed to disrupt a CaM binding motif in the i3 loop (11Wang D.X. Sadée W. Quillan J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22081-22088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Even though each of the five receptor variants tested was able to induce a substantial increase in GTPγS binding of similar magnitude upon exposure to morphine (1 μm), basal levels of GTPγS binding (without agonists) were strongly affected by the i3 loop substitutions. In the absence of agonist, initial basal rates (over 5 min) for nonpretreated cells varied from a low of 109 ± 6 fmol/mg for the R265H variant to a high of 136 ± 6 fmol/mg GTPγS binding for K273A-MOR, previously shown to display enhanced basal G protein coupling (11Wang D.X. Sadée W. Quillan J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22081-22088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Wild type MOR had an intermediate level of basal activity that was significantly enhanced over the empty vector transfected control cells (102 ± 6 fmol/mg protein) as reported earlier (13Wang D.X. Surratt C.K. Sadée W. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 763-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The small elevation in GTPγS binding observed with the R260H and R265H variants did not reach statistical significance. After morphine pretreatment, only the wild type receptor displayed significantly increased basal GTPγS binding over nontreated conditions as shown before (13Wang D.X. Surratt C.K. Sadée W. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 763-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), whereas basal G protein coupling remained unchanged for each of the receptor variants. These results differ from the observations by Befort et al. (16Befort K. Filliol D. Decaillot F.M. Gaveriaux-Ruff C. Hoehe M.R. Kieffer B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3130-3137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), performed under different in vitro conditions, that S268P-MOR is significantly impaired in agonist-stimulated maximal G protein coupling.Table IBasal and morphine-stimulated [35S]GTPγS binding activity in wild-type and variant MOR transfected HEK293 cell membranesReceptor density[35S]GTPγS bindingBasal after morphine pretreatmentDecrease in net morphine stimulation after treatmentaThe values equal [1 − (Emax − Basal)after morphine pretreatment/(Emax − Basal)no pretreatment] × 100.No pretreatmentMorphine pretreatmentBasalEmaxEC50BasalEmaxEC50pmol/mgfmol/mg proteinfmol/mg proteinnmfmol/mg proteinfmol/mg proteinnm% untreated%hMOR3.5 ± 0.5122 ± 3bVersus value for empty-vector transfected cell membranes, which was 102 ± 6 fmol/mg protein,p < 0.05.212 ± 163.7 ± 1.5138 ± 4cVersus basal without morphine treatment, p < 0.05, t test.189 ± 1814.4 ± 1.8113 ± 345 ± 9R260H3.9 ± 0.8111 ± 8187 ± 12dVersus hMOR, p < 0.05.2.4 ± 1.5116 ± 6170 ± 227.5 ± 1.6105 ± 6dVersus hMOR, p < 0.05.27 ± 31R265H4.2 ± 0.8109 ± 6172 ± 7dVersus hMOR, p < 0.05.2.9 ± 1.6115 ± 9167 ± 216.9 ± 2.1105 ± 8dVersus hMOR, p < 0.05.17 ± 24dVersus hMOR, p < 0.05.S268P4.5 ± 0.9122 ± 8bVersus value for empty-vector transfected cell membranes, which was 102 ± 6 fmol/mg protein,p < 0.05.186 ± 8dVersus hMOR, p < 0.05.2.7 ± 1.7119 ± 9179 ± 155.6 ± 1.997 ± 8dVersus hMOR, p < 0.05.16 ± 11eVersus hMOR, p < 0.01.K273A3.5 ± 0.9136 ± 6bVersus value for empty-vector transfected cell membranes, which was 102 ± 6 fmol/mg protein,p < 0.05.251 ± 20dVersus hMOR, p < 0.05.1.5 ± 0.9137 ± 5232 ± 163.2 ± 0.8101 ± 4dVersus hMOR, p < 0.05.15 ± 19eVersus hMOR, p < 0.01.The cells were pretreated with or without 1 μm morphine for 16 h, followed by removal of the agonists before membrane preparation.

Washing of plasma membranes with EGTA pH 8 buffer was used to lower the CaM content of plasma membranes (11Wang D.X. Sadée W. Quillan J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22081-22088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). This procedure significantly increased basal GTPγS binding of wild type MOR (from 123 ± 3 to 139 ± 4 fmol/mg protein, p < 0.01, ttest), but not that of the CaM-binding deficient K273A mutant, as shown previously (11Wang D.X. Sadée W. Quillan J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22081-22088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 13Wang D.X. Surratt C.K. Sadée W. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 763-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Similarly, the three polymorphic MOR variants failed to display significant changes in basal GTPγS binding upon EGTA pH 8 washing (from 118 ± 6 to 117 ± 9, 111 ± 10 to 114 ± 9, 124 ± 10 to 120 ± 14 fmol/mg protein for R260H, R265H, and S268P respectively, p > 0.05,t test, n = 6). This suggested that they either do not interact with CaM, do not have detectable basal activity, or both. To test basal MOR signaling directly, we used the inverse agonist β-CNA, which reduces basal GTPγS binding to the level seen in control cells (empty vector transfected) (11Wang D.X. Sadée W.

Myosin is composed of a motor domain containing an ATP and actin binding region, a neck domain that interacts with specific light chains or calmodulin, and a tail domain that serves to anchor myosin to a specific cellular target. In the last decade, a number of different types of myosins have been discovered by molecular cloning, and based upon their primary structure of the motor domain they are classified in at least 18 classes (1Mooseker M.S. Cheney R.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Myosin X is a newly found myosin from bovine, human (7Berg J.S. Derfler B.H. Pennisi C.M. Corey D.P. Cheney R.E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3439-3451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and mouse (8Yonezawa S. Kimura A. Koshiba S. Masaki S. Ono T. Hanai A. Sonta S. Kageyama T. Takahashi T. Moriyama A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 526-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and it is expressed ubiquitously in various mammalian tissues. Based upon the deduced amino acid sequence, it is predicted that myosin X consists of a motor domain, three IQ motifs that function as light chain binding sites, a coiled-coil domain, and a tail domain. Because of the presence of a coiled-coil domain, it has been thought that myosin X is a two-headed myosin. There are three pleckstrin homology domains, one myosin tail homology domain, and one FERM (4.1/Ezrin/Radixin/Moesin) domain in each heavy chain. Although the actual function of these domains is not known, they could play a role in interactions with membrane phospholipids or other proteins that create an anchoring structure. By immunocytochemistry, it was found (7Berg J.S. Derfler B.H. Pennisi C.M. Corey D.P. Cheney R.E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3439-3451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that myosin X is present at the edge of lamellipodia, membrane ruffles, and the tip of filopodial actin bundles in cultured cells, suggesting that myosin X plays a role in regions where actin is in dynamic reorganization. The localization of myosin X with the actin structure in cells along with the structural features present in myosin X that are conserved among various myosins suggests that myosin X has an actin-based motor activity. However, nothing is known about the motor function of myosin X at a molecular level. There are two aspects underlying the diverse biological function of the myosin superfamily members. One is their unique tail structure, and it is anticipated that each unique tail determines the cellular target molecules thus distributing each myosin for its proper motile processes. The other is the characteristic of myosins in terms of their motor function and regulation. It becomes evident that the motor function among various members of the unconventional myosin subfamily varies uniquely from one to another; this variation is thought to be critical for specific physiological roles in diverse cellular motile processes. Myosin V is a processive motor that can move in large steps approximating the 36-nm pseudo-repeat of the actin filament (9Mehta A.D. Rock R.S. Rief M. Spudich J.A. Mooseker M.S. Cheney R.E. Nature. 1999; 400: 590-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar, 10Walker M.L. Burgess S.A. Sellers J.R. Wang F. Hammer III, J.A. Trinick J. Knight P.J. Nature. 2000; 405: 804-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). These characteristics are quite important to understand the cellular function of myosin V because the processive nature with long step size is suitable for motors involved in cargo movement in cells. Another amazing finding is that myosin VI moves the actin filament with the barbed end leading, indicating that myosin VI moves toward the pointed end, whereas all other characterized myosin motors move toward the barbed end (11Wells A.L. Lin A.W. Chen L.Q. Safer D. Cain S.M. Hasson T. Carragher B.O. Milligan R.A. Sweeney H.L. Nature. 1999; 401: 505-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Because actin structure in cells has polarity, the directionality of the movement is quite important for the physiological relevance of the motor protein. Although it was originally proposed that a unique large insertion of 53 residues between the converter domain and IQ domain of myosin VI plays a key role in the reverse-directed movement of myosin VI, recent results have suggested that this is not the case and that the motor domain itself determines the directionality of myosin VI (12Homma K. Yoshimura M. Saito J. Ikebe R. Ikebe M. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 573aGoogle Scholar). This raises the possibility that other unconventional myosins may show reverse directionality. The role of the IQ motif in unconventional myosins is best studied in myosin I (13Zhu T. Sata M. Ikebe M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 513-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 14Zhu T.

These myosins contain calmodulin as their light chain that associates with the heavy chain at the IQ region. The ATPase activities of these myosins are regulated by Ca2+-induced calmodulin dissociation from the myosin heavy chain. On the other hand, motility activities are completely abolished at pCa 6 in which calmodulin does not dissociate from myosin heavy chain, suggesting that Ca2+-induced conformational change of calmodulin, but not physical dissociation of calmodulin from the heavy chain, is critical for the regulation of motility activity of these myosins. Although nothing is known about the regulation of myosin X, a similar mechanism might be operating because it contains three IQ motifs at its neck domain. The aim of this study was to clarify the motor function and regulation of mammalian myosin X at the molecular level. To achieve this, we expressed myosin X by using a baculovirus expression system because the myosin X expression level in tissues is limited. Our results indicated that myosin X is a plus end-directed nonprocessive motor whose motility activity is inhibited at high Ca2+. Restriction enzymes and modifying enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA).

Chem. 2000; 275: 34766-34771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Smooth muscle myosin was phosphorylated with 15 μg/ml myosin light chain kinase in the presence of 10 μg/ml calmodulin, 2 mm ATP, 2 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, and 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) at 25 °C for 15 min in the presence of 1 μm microcystin. Three cDNA clones of bovine myosin X, i.e. clones 17 (nucleotides 1–1564), 27 (nucleotides 976–2653), and 5-2-1 (nucleotides 2030–7769), were kindly provided by Dr. D. P. Corey (Harvard University). An NheI site and an EcoRI site were created at the 5′-side of the initiation site and nucleotide 1240 of clone 27, respectively. An EcoRI site and anXbaI site were created at nucleotides 1240 and 2517 of clone 17, respectively. Two XbaI sites were also created at nucleotides 2517 and 3138 of clone 5-2-1, respectively. The clone 27 was then digested with NheI/EcoRI, and the fragment was subcloned into pFastBac baculovirus transfer vector containing a hexahistidine tag sequence at the 3′-end of the polylinker region. Clone 17 was digested with EcoRI/XbaI, and the 1.3-kilobase fragment was introduced into pFastBac/clone 27. Finally an XbaI fragment (0.6 kilobase) excised from clone 5-2-1 was inserted into the above vector. This construct (M10CC) contains the entire motor domain, neck domain, and coiled-coil domain with a hexahistidine tag at the C-terminal end. To express recombinant myosin X, 200 ml of Sf9 cells (about 1 × 109) were co-infected with two separate viruses expressing the myosin X heavy chain and calmodulin, respectively. The cells were cultured at 28 °C in 175-cm2 flasks and harvested after 3 days. Cells were lysed with sonication in 20 ml of Lysis Buffer (0.1m NaCl, 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EGTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 0.01 mg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor, and 1 mm ATP). After centrifugation at 140,000 × g for 20 min, the supernatant was mixed with 0.3 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) agarose (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) in a 50-ml conical tube on a rotating wheel for 20 min at 4 °C. The resin suspension was then loaded on a column (1 × 10 cm) and was washed with a 10-fold volume of buffer B (0.3m KCl, 10 mm imidazole (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EGTA, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.01 mg/ml leupeptin). Myosin X was eluted with buffer B plus 0.2m imidazole. After SDS-PAGE1 analysis, fractions containing myosin X were pooled and dialyzed against 30 mm KCl, 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 0.1 mmEGTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The purified myosin X was stored on ice and used within 2 days. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out on a 7.5–20% polyacrylamide gradient slab gel using the discontinuous buffer system of Laemmli (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). The molecular mass markers used were smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (204 kDa), β-galactosidase (116 kDa), phosphorylase b (97.4 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), ovalbumin (45 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), myosin regulatory light chain (20 kDa), and α-lactalbumin (14.2 kDa). The amount of the myosin X heavy chain and calmodulin was determined by densitometry as described previously (14Zhu T. Beckingham K. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20481-20486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The steady state ATPase activity was determined by measuring liberated32Pi at 25 °C as described previously (22Ikebe M. Hartshorne D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13146-13153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ATPase activity was also measured in the presence of an ATP regeneration system, 20 units/ml pyruvate kinase, and 3 mmphosphoenolpyruvate. The liberated pyruvate was determined as described previously (25Reynard A.M. Hass L.E. Jacobsen D.D. Boyer P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 2277-2282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The in vitro motility assay was performed as described previously (26Sata M. Matsuura M. Ikebe M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11113-11118Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Myosin X was attached to the coverslip. Actin filament velocity was calculated from the movement distance and the elapsed time in successive snapshots. Student's t test was used for statistical comparison of mean values. A value of p < 0.01 was considered to be significant. F-actin (1.3 mg/ml) was first labeled with a 5 molar excess of tetramethylrhodamine-5-(or -6-)maleimide (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in the presence of 8 μm phalloidin, 25 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 25 mmimidazole (pH 7.5) (buffer A) in the dark for 40 min at 4 °C. After the reaction was stopped by adding 10 mm dithiothreitol, the fluorescently labeled F-actin was obtained by centrifugation (250,000 × g for 10 min). The pellet was homogenized with buffer A with 5 mm dithiothreitol and then precipitated again (250,000 × g for 10 min) to wash away the residual dye. The homogenate was diluted with the same buffer (F-actin concentration should be ∼0.03 mg/ml) and subjected to sonication to make the minus end cap. The fragmentation of the fluorescently labeled F-actin was confirmed under a fluorescence microscope. 0.1–1 μm G-actin was added to the fragmented fluorescently labeled F-actin (2–15 μg/ml) in 25 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 25 mm imidazole (pH 7.5), and 10 units/ml fluorescein phalloidin (Molecular Probes). The elongation of the actin filament was carried out overnight in the dark at 4 °C. The binding of calmodulin to M10CC heavy chain was determined by actin co-sedimentation assay. M10CC was incubated in buffer containing 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 10 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.025 mg/ml F-actin, and various concentrations of EGTA at 25 °C for 15 min. The sample was ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min, and the pellets were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The amount of the co-sedimented M10CC heavy chain and calmodulin were determined by densitometry as described previously (14Zhu T. Beckingham K. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20481-20486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The bovine myosin X construct was produced and expressed in Sf9 insect cells. The construct (M10CC) contains the entire coiled-coil domain in addition to the complete head domain with a C-terminal hexahistidine tag to aid in purification (Fig. 1). The cells were co-infected with an appropriate ratio of myosin X-expressing virus and calmodulin-expressing virus. The functional myosin X was only obtained with co-infection of calmodulin virus in contrast to myosin V in which functional protein can be obtained without calmodulin co-infection (27Trybus K.M. Kremensova E. Freyzon Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27448-27456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The myosin X-enriched fraction was applied to a nickel-agarose affinity column using the hexahistidine tag to completely purify the expressed myosin X (M10CC) (Fig.2).Figure 2Expression and purification of M10CC.The sample of each purification step was examined by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue.

The purified M10CC construct was composed of a high molecular mass band and a low molecular mass band and was free from 200-kDa Sf9 conventional myosin and actin. The high molecular mass band (110 kDa) was consistent with the calculated molecular mass of M10CC and was recognized by anti-His antibodies (Santa Cruz Biochemicals, Santa Cruz, CA) indicating that the high molecular mass band is the expressed myosin X heavy chains (not shown). The small subunits showed a mobility shift with a change in [Ca2+] that is characteristic of calmodulin, suggesting that the small subunits are indeed calmodulin (not shown). The identification of the small subunit was also confirmed using anti-calmodulin antibodies (not shown). The stoichiometry of calmodulin versus M10CC heavy chain was determined by densitometry to be 2.8 ± 0.3, consistent with the three IQ motifs in M10CC construct. The Mg2+-ATPase activity of myosin X was markedly activated by actin. Fig. 3 shows the actin concentration dependence of the actin-activated ATPase activity of myosin X. The actin concentration required for the saturation of the activation was much higher than that of myosin V (18Homma K. Saito J. Ikebe R. Ikebe M. J. Biol.

The curve fit with an equation of v =Vm [actin]/(Kactin + [actin]) gave a Kactin of 28 μm. The result suggests that the predominant steady state intermediate of the myosin X ATPase reaction is a weak actin binding state. Fig. 4 shows the actin-activated ATPase activity as a function of ATP concentration. The ATP dependence shows a single saturation curve, and a KATP of 3.4 μm was obtained from the best curve fit analysis, suggesting a high affinity of myosin X for ATP. It has been shown that the actin-activated ATPase activity of myosin V is markedly attenuated with reaction time, and this is due to the inhibition by ADP liberated during the ATPase reaction. This suggests a high affinity of myosin V for ADP. Fig. 5 shows the time course of the actin-activated ATPase reaction of myosin X. In contrast to myosin V, the ATPase activity in the absence of the ATP regeneration system was not significantly changed with time, although the activity was slightly decreased at a prolonged time. The activity in the absence of the ATP regeneration system at the early time was nearly identical to that in the presence of the ATP regeneration system. The result indicates that actomyosin X ATPase activity is not significantly inhibited by ADP. To further confirm this notion, the ATPase activity was measured as a function of ADP (Fig.6). ADP did not strongly inhibit the ATPase activity, and the curve fit analysis with the equation ofv =Vm [ATP]/(KATP (1 + [ADP]/KADP) + [ATP]) yielded aKADP of 6.4 μm.Figure 5Time course of the actin-activated ATPase activity of M10CC with and without the ATP-regenerating system.ATPase activity was measured in the presence (▪) and absence (●) of 20 units/ml pyruvate kinase and 3 mm phosphoenol pyruvate using 50 μm actin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 6Inhibition of the actin-activated ATPase activity of M10CC by ADP.

The decrease in the activity above pCa 5 was rescued by the addition of exogenous calmodulin, suggesting that the decrease in the activity at this range of Ca2+ is because of the dissociation of calmodulin from the myosin X heavy chain. The low ATPase activity in high Ca2+ is because of the decrease inVmax but not the increase inKactin (Fig. 4), suggesting that Ca2+ does not influence the interaction between myosin X and actin. It has been shown for myosin I and myosin V that 1–2 mol of calmodulin/mol of myosin head dissociates from the heavy chain at high Ca2+, and this is attributed to the change in the ATPase activity. Therefore, we examined whether the bound calmodulin of myosin X dissociates from the heavy chain at high Ca2+. M10CC was mixed with F-actin in various free Ca2+ concentrations and then ultracentrifuged to determine the amount of bound calmodulin to myosin X. The myosin X-bound calmodulin co-precipitated with actin was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the amount of calmodulin was quantitated by densitometry with normalization with myosin X heavy chain. As a control, free calmodulin was centrifuged with F-actin, but no calmodulin co-precipitation was detected. M10CC was not precipitated at all in the absence of F-actin (not shown). As shown in Fig.8, the amount of calmodulin bound to M10CC decreased at Ca2+ concentrations above pCa 5. The densitometric analysis revealed that 1 mol of the bound calmodulin dissociates from the myosin X heavy chain.Figure 8Effects of Ca2+ on the dissociation of calmodulin from M10CC. M10CC (5 μg/ml) was dialyzed against buffers of pCa 7, 6, 5, and 4 and then actin (0.025 mg/ml) was added. After centrifugation (100,000 ×g, 30 min), pellets were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the concentrations of M10CC and calmodulin were determined by densitometry. The experiment was done three times, and the bars represent standard deviation. Theinset shows SDS-PAGE of the pellets of M10CC co-precipitated with actin.

The velocity was 0.3 μm/s under 1 mm EGTA conditions, but the motility activity was completely inhibited at Ca2+ concentrations higher thanpCa 6. The inhibition of the motility was not rescued by the addition of exogenous calmodulin (up to 60 μm) (Fig.9 B), suggesting that the inhibition of the motility is not due to the dissociation of calmodulin from myosin X but rather due to the conformational change of the bound calmodulin upon Ca2+binding. Consistently no detectable calmodulin dissociation was observed at pCa 6 (Fig. 8). The motility inhibited atpCa 6 was recovered by reducing the Ca2+concentration to pCa 7 without the addition of exogenous calmodulin. Fig. 10 shows the actin sliding velocity of the in vitro motility assay as a function of ATP concentration. M10CC moved the actin filaments at low ATP concentration and reached the maximum velocity at 100 μm ATP. The low ATP requirement of the motility activity is also found for myosin II and myosin V and is consistent with the low KATPvalue for the actin-activated ATPase activity of myosin X. Quite recently it was shown that the mammalian class VI myosin is a minus end-directed motor in contrast to other known myosins (11Wells A.L. Lin A.W. Chen L.Q. Safer D. Cain S.M. Hasson T. Carragher B.O. Milligan R.A. Sweeney H.L. Nature. 1999; 401: 505-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Myosin VI has a unique insertion between the motor domain and the neck domain, and this was hypothesized to be responsible for the reverse directionality of motility (11Wells A.L. Lin A.W. Chen L.Q. Safer D. Cain S.M. Hasson T. Carragher B.O. Milligan R.A. Sweeney H.L. Nature. 1999; 401: 505-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). However, recent finding questioned this view (12Homma K. Yoshimura M. Saito J. Ikebe R. Ikebe M. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 573aGoogle Scholar), opening up the possible presence of other minus end-directed myosin motors within the myosin superfamily. We used dual fluorescent-labeled F-actin filaments in thein vitro motility assay to determine the direction of movement of myosin X. F-actin was labeled throughout with fluorescein and labeled with a tetramethylrhodamine cap at the pointed end of the filament. The dual fluorescent-labeled F-actin filaments were visualized under the fluorescence microscope moving on coverslips coated with myosin X. As shown in Fig. 11 A, myosin X moved the dual fluorescence-labeled F-actin with the pointed end at the front of the movement. This means that myosin X moves toward the barbed end as is known for the conventional myosins. Fig.11 B shows a histogram of the velocities of polarity-marked actin filaments on myosin X-coated coverslips. Although some variation of the sliding velocity was observed, all actin filaments moved in the same direction. The result shows that myosin X is a plus-directed motor. It is known that myosin dissociates upon ATP binding to produce a weak actin binding form. The binding of myosin X to actin in the presence of ATP was measured by actin co-sedimentation assay. Myosin X was readily dissociated from actin in the presence of ATP, and a predominant amount of myosin X was recovered in the supernatant (Fig. 12). This property is similar to conventional myosin but different from myosin V. The result is consistent with the highKactin of the actomyosin X ATPase reaction and suggests that the predominant intermediate of the myosin X ATPase reaction is a weak actin binding form. It is known that actin filaments detach from the coverslip surface below a certain critical surface density of the nonprocessive motors, whereas a processive motor binds and holds an actin filament even at a low surface density. This is closely related to the difference in the duty ratio of the two types of motors. Fig.13 shows the actin filament velocity as a function of various myosin surface densities. The actin filament velocity over myosin V did not change over a wide range of surface densities and supported the motility at very low surface density. On the other hand, smooth muscle myosin II dropped in velocity as the density decreased. Myosin X motility also dropped with decreasing surface density, but the critical density was significantly lower than that for smooth muscle myosin II. Because the surface density dependence of the motility velocity is closely related to the duty ratio of the motors (31Rock R.S. Rief M. Mehta A.D. Spudich J.A. Methods. 2000; 22: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), the result suggests that the duty ratio of myosin X is higher than that of myosin II, although its duty ratio would not be as sufficiently high as a processive motor. Myosin X is a newly found member of the myosin superfamily that is composed of at least 18 classes (1Mooseker M.S. Cheney R.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 633-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 2Titus M.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 119-123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 3Hodge T. Cope M.J. J.

Quite recently it was reported that myosin X in cultured cells is present at the edge of lamellipodia, membrane ruffles, and tips of filopodial actin bundles, suggesting that myosin X plays a role where actin structure dynamically changes (7Berg J.S. Derfler B.H. Pennisi C.M. Corey D.P. Cheney R.E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3439-3451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This finding as well as the primary structure of myosin X has led to the suggestion that it may be a motor protein, yet there is no information about the motor function of myosin X and its regulation at a molecular level. The present study revealed for the first time the mechanoenzymatic characteristic of myosin X and its regulation at a molecular level. One of the critical issues to understand the physiological function of various types of myosins is the motor characteristic of each type of myosin. For instance, a processive motor that proceeds many steps without dissociating from actin is suitable for supporting cargo movements, whereas a nonprocessive motor is preferable for fast movement or high force production because many motor molecules can interact with a single actin filament without interfering with each other. The present results indicate that myosin X has a weak affinity for actin in the presence of ATP because 1) a majority of myosin X dissociated from actin in the presence of ATP and 2)Kactin for the actin-activated ATPase activity is high. The results also suggest that the predominant steady state intermediate of actomyosin X ATPase is a weak actin binding state. This is different from myosin V, a processive myosin, which shows a strong actin binding in the presence of ATP. This is because M·ADP (where M refers to a myosin head), a strong actin binding intermediate, is the predominant reaction intermediate of the ATPase reaction (28DeLa Cruz E.M. Wells A.L. Rosenfeld S.S. Ostap E.M. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13726-13731Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) and rather similar to myosin II, a nonprocessive myosin. Consistently the actomyosin X ATPase activity was hardly inhibited by ADP suggesting that the ADP release step is not rate-limiting for the ATPase reaction. This is in contrast to the myosin V ATPase reaction where ADP markedly inhibits the steady state actin-activated ATPase activity (28DeLa Cruz E.M. Wells A.L. Rosenfeld S.S. Ostap E.M. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13726-13731Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). These results indicate that myosin X is a nonprocessive myosin. To further address this issue, we examined the actin translocating velocity as a function of myosin X surface density in the in vitro gliding actin filament assay. It was revealed that myosin X can support the actin filament movement at a significantly lower surface density than myosin II but at a surface density much higher than that of myosin V. The result suggests that although myosin X is a nonprocessive myosin, its duty ratio would be significantly larger than that of myosin II. Another important issue of the motor characteristic of myosin is the directionality. The recent finding of myosin VI to step in a backward direction fundamentally changed the view of polarity of actin filament-based movements in cells. According to Wells et al.(11Wells A.L. Lin A.W. Chen L.Q. Safer D. Cain S.M. Hasson T. Carragher B.O. Milligan R.A. Sweeney H.L. Nature. 1999; 401: 505-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar), a large insertion between the motor domain and IQ domain present in myosin VI is a determinant of the reverse directionality of myosin VI. However, this view was questioned recently (12Homma K. Yoshimura M. Saito J. Ikebe R. Ikebe M. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 573aGoogle Scholar) raising the possibility of other unconventional myosins having reverse directionality. Therefore, we examined the directionality of myosin X using dual fluorescent-labeled F-actin filaments. The present result clearly demonstrated that myosin X is a plus-directed myosin unlike myosin VI. No actin filaments moved to the opposite direction indicating that the directionality is uniquely determined with myosin motor without any fluctuation of the biased movement. Ca2+ dependence of the actin-activated ATPase activity showed a sharp decrease in the activity above pCa 6. This decrease in the activity is due to the dissociation of 1 mol of calmodulin light chain because 1) the decrease in the activity is rescued by the addition of exogenous calmodulin and 2) 1 mol of calmodulin light chain dissociated from myosin X heavy chain atpCa 5 and higher. Similar findings have been made with myosin V (18Homma K. Saito J. Ikebe R. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34766-34771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the actin translocating activity of myosin X is inhibited at pCa 6 in which no significant dissociation of calmodulin occurs. The inhibition of the motility of calmodulin-containing mammalian unconventional myosins was first demonstrated with myosin I (13Zhu T. Sata M. Ikebe M.

Chem. 2000; 275: 34766-34771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 30Cheney R.E. O'Shea M.K. Heuser J.E. Coelho M.V. Wolenski J.S. Espreafico E.M. Forscher P. Larson R.E. Mooseker M.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 13-23Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). It was thought originally that the inhibition of the motility is due to the dissociation of calmodulin from the heavy chain at high Ca2+ (15Collins K. Sellers J.R. Matsudaira P. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1137-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). But recent studies have revealed that the inhibition does not require the dissociation of calmodulin but that Ca2+ binding at the high affinity sites of calmodulin triggers the inhibition presumably because of a large conformational change of calmodulin (13Zhu T. Sata M. Ikebe M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 513-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 14Zhu T. Beckingham K. Ikebe M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 34766-34771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Addition of exogenous calmodulin did not rescue the inhibition of the motility activity of myosin X unless Ca2+ concentration was decreased. These results are consistent with the recent results with myosin V and myosin Iβ and indicate that the dissociation of calmodulin is not directly related to the inhibition of motility, but the conformational change of the heavy chain-bound calmodulin upon binding of Ca2+ is responsible for the inhibition of the movement. The inhibition occurs betweenpCa 7 and pCa 6 at which cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration is regulated in most cell types, and therefore the observed inhibition is physiologically relevant. There is an apparent decoupling between the ATP hydrolysis cycle and mechanical events at higher Ca2+. This is different from the regulation of conventional myosins in which the regulatory domain regulates both ATPase and mechanical activities (32Hartshorne D.J. Johnson L.R. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, New York1987: 423-482Google Scholar, 33Sellers J.R. Adelstein R.S. Boyer P. Krebs E.G. The Enzymes. Academic Press, San Diego1987: 381-418Google Scholar, 34Tan J.L. Ravid S. Spudich J.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 721-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The mechanism that underlies the apparent uncoupling between the ATP hydrolysis and the motility is unknown. One possibility is that a change in the rigidity at the lever-arm domain of myosin upon Ca2+binding to calmodulin could uncouple the mechanical activity and ATP hydrolysis of myosin. Further studies are required to clarify the mechanism underlying the uncoupling of ATP hydrolysis and motility. While this manuscript was in preparation, Chen et al. (35Chen L. Wang F. Meng H. Sellers J.R. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 573aGoogle Scholar) reported in abstract form that mammalian myosin X has an actin-activated ATPase activity with a Vm of 10 s−1 at 37 °C and an actin translocating velocity of 0.18 μm/s at 30 °C. The values for the ATPase activity are comparable with the present study (Vm of 4.7 s−1 at 25 °C), but the actin sliding velocity is lower than that of the present study (0.3 μm/s at 25 °C). Quite recently it was reported that calmodulin-like protein (CLP) can serve as a light chain of myosin X in epithelial cells (36Rogers M.S. Strehler E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12182-12189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, CLP is only expressed in epithelial cells, whereas myosin X is expressed in a variety of tissues (7Berg J.S. Derfler B.H. Pennisi C.M. Corey D.P. Cheney R.E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3439-3451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that do not express CLP. Therefore, it is likely that calmodulin rather than CLP is the light chain of myosin X in most tissues. It should be noted that it was reported that myosin X shows higher affinity for calmodulin than for CLP and that the actin-activated ATPase activity of myosin X is not markedly affected by the difference in the light chains, i.e. calmodulin or CLP (35Chen L. Wang F. Meng H. Sellers J.R. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 573aGoogle Scholar). Further study is required for the function of CLP in myosin X motor properties. We thank Dr. D. P. Corey (Harvard University) for providing us myosin X cDNA fragments."

Short-term stimulation of mesangial cells with the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β) leads to a rapid and transient increase in neutral sphingomyelinase activity (Kaszkin, M., Huwiler, A., Scholz, K., van den Bosch, H., and Pfeilschifter, J. (1998) FEBS Lett. 440, 163–166). In this study, we report on a second delayed peak of activation occurring after hours of IL-1β treatment. This second phase of activation was first detectable after 2 h of treatment and steadily increased over the next 2 h, reaching maximal values after 4 h. In parallel, a pronounced increase in neutral ceramidase activity was observed, accounting for a constant or even decreased level of ceramide after long-term IL-1β treatment, despite continuous sphingomyelinase activation. The increase in neutral ceramidase activity was due to expressional up-regulation, as detected by an increase in mRNA levels and enhanced de novo protein synthesis. The increase in neutral ceramidase protein levels and activity could be blocked dose- dependently by the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB 202190, whereas the classical MAPK pathway inhibitor U0126 and the protein kinase C inhibitor Ro 318220 were ineffective. Moreover, cotreatment of cells for 24 h with IL-1β and SB 202190 led to an increase in ceramide formation. Interestingly, IL-1β-stimulated neutral ceramidase activation was not reduced in mesangial cells isolated from mice deficient in MAPK-activated protein kinase-2, which is a downstream substrate of p38 MAPK, thus suggesting that the p38 MAPK-mediated induction of neutral ceramidase occurs independently of the MAPK-activated protein kinase-2 pathway. In summary, our results suggest a biphasic regulation of sphingomyelin hydrolysis in cytokine-treated mesangial cells with delayed de novosynthesis of neutral ceramidase counteracting sphingomyelinase activity and apoptosis.

Kidney Int. 1992; 41: 524-529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Inflammatory diseases of the renal glomerulus are accompanied by enhanced formation of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β).1 The primary source is the activated macrophage, but IL-1β is also released by many other cell types after exposure to an inflammatory environment. Soluble IL-1β is the predominant form in biological fluids, and it binds to specific receptors in target tissues. IL-1 is an exemplary pro-inflammatory cytokine that is particularly important in the systemic response to inflammation. It synergizes with tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) for many of its actions, and its synthesis is stimulated, in turn, by TNF-α. Furthermore, it is implicated in the pathogenesis of diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, septic shock, and several autoimmune reactions. In the past, it has become clear that sphingolipids exert important roles as signaling molecules under various physiological and pathophysiological conditions (4Huwiler A. Kolter T. Pfeilschifter J.

Especially ceramide has attracted a lot of interest due to its potential involvement in regulation of programmed cell death, cell growth arrest, and differentiation (4Huwiler A. Kolter T.

However, the regulating mechanisms that determine the intracellular ceramide level are still poorly understood. Most studies have focused on the ceramide-generating enzymes, i.e. the acid and neutral sphingomyelinases. Based on activity measurements from cell extracts, activators of acid and/or neutral sphingomyelinases have been determined and include pro-inflammatory cytokines, growth factors, and other environmental stress stimuli (4Huwiler A.

It is equally important to understand the involvement of ceramide-degrading enzymes, the ceramidases, which hydrolyze ceramide to yield sphingosine. Sphingosine on its own can act either in a proliferative (8Merrill Jr., A.H. Schmelz E.M. Dillehay D.L. Spiege S. Shayman J.A. Schroeder J.J. Riley R.T. Voss K.A. Wang E. Toxicol. Appl.

Due to this equally important role of ceramidases in determining cellular levels of ceramide, which is a pro-apoptotic stimulus, and sphingosine 1-phosphate being a proliferative stimulus, it is essential to understand the regulation of these enzymes. It has become clear that there are at least two subtypes of ceramidases existing in mammalian cells: an acidic form, which is localized in the lysosomes (17Li C.M. Hong S.B. Kopal G. He X. Linke T.

It is tempting to speculate that this enzyme plays an equally important role in signal transduction as the sphingomyelinase and it counterbalances ceramide generation by the latter enzyme. Biochemical characterization of this novel neutral ceramidase reveals that it is a 94-kDa enzyme in mouse tissue (18Tani M. Okino N. Mori K. Tanigawa T. Izu H. Ito M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11229-11234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and a 110–120-kDa enzyme in rat tissue (19Mitsutake S. Tani M. Okino N. Mori K. Ichinose S. Omori A.

Chem. 2001; 276: 26249-26259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), containing several putative protein kinase C and casein kinase II phosphorylation sites in its primary sequence. Recently, El Bawab et al. (20El Bawab S. Roddy P. Qian T. Bielawska A. Lemasters J.J. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21508-21513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) cloned another human neutral ceramidase that contained an N-terminal mitochondrial signal peptide and therefore was suggested to be a mitochondrial enzyme. In this study, we investigated the effect of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β on the neutral sphingomyelinase and neutral ceramidase activities in rat mesangial cells. We show that chronic IL-1β treatment of mesangial cells leads to a biphasic activation of the neutral sphingomyelinase and a delayed activation of the neutral ceramidase, ultimately leaving cellular ceramide levels low. The activation of the neutral ceramidase is due to expressional up-regulation of the gene. [14C]Serine (specific activity, 53 Ci/mol), [14C]sphingomyelin (specific activity, 55 Ci/mol), [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine pro-mixture (specific activity, >1000 Ci/mmol), [α-32P]dCTP (specific activity, 3000 Ci/mmol), and protein A-Sepharose CL-4B were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech(Freiburg, Germany). [14C]Ceramide (specific activity, 55 Ci/mol) was from ICN Biomedicals GmbH (Eschwege, Germany). SB 202190, U0126 and Ro 318220 were from Calbiochem-Novabiochem (Schwabach, Germany). All cell culture nutrients were from Life Technologies, Inc. (Karlsruhe, Germany). Interleukin-1β was kindly provided by Novartis Pharma Ltd. TNF-α was a gift of Knoll AG (Ludwigshafen, Germany). An antibody against acid ceramidase was kindly provided by Prof. K. Sandhoff (University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany). A synthetic peptide (ENHKDSGNHWFSTC) based on the N-terminal sequence of the murine neutral ceramidase (GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank accession number AB037111) was synthesized, coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and used to immunize rabbits. For characterization of the antibody, lysates of IL-1β-stimulated (8 h) rat mesangial cells were separated on a MonoQ column coupled to a BioLogic FPLC® system. The cell lysate was loaded into 25 mm Tris (pH 7.4) and eluted with a linear gradient of 1 m NaCl in 25 mmTris (pH 7.4) at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. The eluted fractions were analyzed by Western blotting and neutral ceramidase activity assay. Rat mesangial cells were cultivated and characterized as described previously (21Pfeilschifter J. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 469-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In a second step, single cells were cloned by limited dilution on 96-well plates. Clones with apparent mesangial cell morphology were characterized by positive staining for the intermediate filaments desmin and vimentin (considered to be specific for myogenic cells), positive staining for Thy1.1 antigen, and negative staining for Factor VIII-related antigen and cytokeratin (excluding endothelial and epithelial contaminations, respectively). For the experiments, passages 8–20 were used. Confluent mesangial cells in 60-mm diameter dishes were stimulated for the indicated time periods in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin. To stop the reaction, the medium was removed, and the cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were then scraped directly into lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μm pepstatin A, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and homogenized by 10 passes through a 26-gauge needle fitted to a 1-ml syringe. The homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 × g, and the supernatant was taken for protein determination. 100 μg of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and Western blot analysis was performed as previously described (22Huwiler A. Wartmann M. van den Bosch H. Pfeilschifter J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 129: 612-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) using polyclonal antibodies against neutral and acid ceramidases at dilutions of 1: 500 and 1:2000, respectively. Confluent mesangial cells in 100-mm diameter dishes were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in the absence or presence of the stimulators for the indicated time periods. For the last 4 h of incubation, [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine were added (140 μCi/plate). After labeling, cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were then scraped directly into 1 ml of lysis buffer and homogenized. The homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 × g, and the supernatant was taken for immunoprecipitation. Samples of 1-ml volume containing 250 × 106 cpm of labeled proteins, 5% fetal calf serum, and 1.5 mmiodoacetamide in lysis buffer were incubated overnight at 4 °C with a polyclonal antiserum against the neutral ceramidase at a dilution of 1:100. 100 μl of a 50% slurry of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B in phosphate-buffered saline were then added, and the mixture was rotated for 1 h at room temperature. After centrifugation for 5 min at 3000 × g, immunocomplexes were washed three times with low salt buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, and 0.1% SDS), three times with high salt buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 500 mm NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, and 0.1% SDS), and once with 10 mm Tris. Pellets were boiled for 5 min in Laemmli dissociation buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. After fixing in 25% isopropyl alcohol and 10% acetic acid, the gels were dried and exposed on a Bio-Imaging Analyzer (Fuji). Total RNA was isolated using guanidinium isothiocyanate solution. 1.5 μg of RNA were used for reverse transcriptase-PCR (first strand cDNA synthesis kit, MBI Fermentas, St. Leon-Rot, Germany). PCR was carried out as follows (Taq DNA polymerase, recombinant, MBI Fermentas, St. Leon-Rot, Germany): 94 °C for 5 min (one cycle); 94 °C for 1 min, 52 °C for 1.5 min, and 72 °C for 1 min (with a variable number of cycles); and a final extension at 72 °C for 7 min. The number of cycles was 30 for murine neutral ceramidase, 35 for rat neutral ceramidase, and 25 for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). The sequences of the primers for analysis of mRNA were as follows: mouse neutral ceramidase, TTC AAT TCG GGA CTT CAG TGG (forward) and CAA GAA TGT TGG GTG ACA CG (reverse); rat neutral ceramidase, TGA AGA CGT GTA AAG CCG C (forward) and TGC GAT AAC GAC AGT CAT ATC C (reverse); and GAPDH, AAT GCA TCC TGC ACC ACC AA (forward) and GTC ATT GAG AGC AAT GCC AGC (reverse). PCR products (793-bp length for mouse neutral ceramidase, 377-bp length for rat neutral ceramidase, and 470-bp length for GAPDH) were run on a 1.5% agarose gel containing 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide. The identities of amplicons were confirmed by sequencing using a Model 310 genetic analyzer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Total RNA was isolated using guanidinium isothiocyanate solution. 25 μg of RNA were separated by electrophoresis on formaldehyde-containing 1% agarose gels. RNA was transferred to a nylon membrane by vacuum blotting for 2 h at 55 millibars and cross-linked by UV light. Blots were hybridized with a 540-bp reverse transcriptase-PCR product (forward primer, CCA GTG GGT GAA CAT GAC AG; and reverse primer, GAT GTA TGC AGA CAG GGT GT) for the rat neutral ceramidase and a 1206-bp reverse transcriptase-PCR product (forward primer, GGG GTA CCT GGG AAG ATG GGG GGC CAA AGT CTT CTC; and reverse primer, GAC TAC TGC TCA CCA GCC TAT ACA AG) for the acid ceramidase, which were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the Multiprime DNA labeling System (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Hybridization was carried out at 42 °C for 16 h, and the membranes were exposed on Bio-Imaging Analyzer (Fuji). To correct for variations in RNA amounts, blots were finally rehybridized with a32P-labeled GAPDH cDNA probe. Confluent mesangial cells in 30-mm diameter dishes were labeled for 24 h with [14C]serine (0.2 μCi/ml) and stimulated as indicated. Lipids were extracted (23Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1953; 37: 911-917Crossref Scopus (42689) Google Scholar), and ceramide was resolved by sequential one-dimensional thin-layer chromatography using chloroform/methanol/ammonium hydroxide solution 25% (65:35:7.5, v/v), followed by chloroform/methanol/acetic acid (9:1:1, v/v). Spots corresponding to ceramide were analyzed and quantified using a Bio-Imaging Analyzer. Alternatively, ceramide was quantitated by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The liquid chromatography unit consisted of a Jasco DG-1580-53 degasser, a Jasco LG-1580-02 ternary gradient unit, a Jasco PU-1585 pump, and a Jasco AS-1550 autosampler (Jasco, Gross-Umstadt, Germany). The mass spectrometer consisted of a PE Sciex API 3000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Langen, Germany) equipped with a turbo ion spray interface. Nitrogen (high purity) was supplied by a Whatman nitrogen generator (Whatman GmbH, Göttingen, Germany). Chromatographic separation of extracted samples was performed in isocratic mode with a Nucleosil C18 column (30 × 2.0-mm inner diameter, 5-μm particle size, and 100-Å pore size; Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany). The mobile phase consisted of methanol containing 5 mm ammonium acetate. The flow rate was set at 0.2 ml/min. The injection volume was 10 μl, and the run time was 3 min. The turbo ion spray interface was operated in the positive ion mode at 5200 V and 200 °C and was supplied by an auxiliary gas flow of 4500 ml/min. The nebulizer gas was set at 1.23 liters/min (setting 10); the curtain gas flow was set at 1.08 liters/min (setting 9); and the collision gas was set at 3.7 × 10−6 hectopascals (3.02 × 1015molecules/cm2; setting 4). Nitrogen was used for all gases. C16:0 ceramide standards and cellular lipid extracts were resuspended in 1000 μl of 5 mm ammonium acetate/methanol buffer just prior to mass spectrometric analysis. Standards were analyzed at concentrations ranging from 25 nm to 10 μm. Quantitation was performed by multiple reaction monitoring (dwell time, 200 ms) of the protonated precursor ion and related product ions. The mass transition used for quantification was m/z 538.4 → 264.2 (collision energy, 33 eV). The mass transitions used as qualifier were m/z 538.4 → 82.1 (collision energy, 77 eV) and 538.4 → 252.1 (collision energy, 39 eV). The analytical data were processed by Analyst software (Version 1.1). Confluent mesangial cells in 60-mm diameter dishes were incubated with the indicated stimuli in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin for the indicated time periods. Neutral and acid sphingomyelinase activities were measured according to Liu and Hannun (24Liu B. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16281-16287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) and Quintern et al. (25Quintern L.E. Weitz G. Nehrkorn H. Tager J.M. Schram A.W. Sandhoff K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 922: 323-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) with some modifications as previously described (26Huwiler A. Pfeilschifter J. van den Bosch H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7190-7195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Confluent mesangial cells were stimulated as described above and homogenized in lysis buffer containing 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.5), 0.5% Triton X-100, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 5 mmd-galactonic acid γ-lactone for the acid ceramidase and 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 0.5% Triton X-100, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 5 mmd-galactonic acid γ-lactone for the neutral ceramidase. Activity assays were performed according to Mitsutake et al. (27Mitsutake S. Kita K. Okino N. Ito M. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 247: 52-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) with some modifications as previously described (26Huwiler A. Pfeilschifter J. van den Bosch H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7190-7195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Statistical analysis was performed by one-way analysis of variance. For multiple comparisons with the same control group, the limit of significance was divided by the number of comparisons according to Bonferroni. Previously, we have shown that the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β causes a rapid (within minutes) and transient activation of neutral sphingomyelinase activity in rat mesangial cells (28Kaszkin M. Huwiler A. Scholz K. van den Bosch H. Pfeilschifter J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 163-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), which leads to increased ceramide formation (28Kaszkin M. Huwiler A. Scholz K. van den Bosch H. Pfeilschifter J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 163-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 29Huwiler A. Brunner J. Hummel R. Vervoordeldonk M. Stabel S. van den Bosch H. Pfeilschifter J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6959-6963Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). We now have extended these studies and found that prolonged treatment of mesangial cells with IL-1β resulted in a delayed second peak of neutral sphingomyelinase activation that was first detectable after 2 h of stimulation and reached a maximum after 4 h (Fig. 1 A). The acid sphingomyelinase also showed a time-dependent delayed activation after IL-1β treatment (Fig. 1 B). Surprisingly, when the level of ceramide was measured by tandem mass spectrometry after IL-1β stimulation, no increase was observed up to 24 h after stimulation (Fig. 1 C), thus pointing toward additional compensatory mechanisms that regulate the ceramide content of the cell. In contrast, 1 h of stimulation with a bacterial sphingomyelinase led to an 8–10-fold increase in ceramide levels (Fig.1 C). To investigate the effect of IL-1β on the ceramide-degrading enzymes, rat mesangial cells were stimulated for different time periods with the cytokine, and ceramidase activity was measured. As shown in Fig. 2(A and B), IL-1β caused a chronic activation of acid and neutral ceramidases, with maximal stimulation occurring 4 h after cytokine exposure and subsequently remaining at high levels. To test whether the increase in neutral ceramidase activity is due to an increased amount of neutral ceramidase protein, Western blot analysis was performed using a polyclonal antiserum raised against a peptide comprising the N terminus of the murine neutral ceramidase. The antiserum recognized a double band of ∼110–120 kDa. This size is in agreement with the recently described size of rat kidney neutral ceramidase (19Mitsutake S. Tani M. Okino N. Mori K. Ichinose S. Omori A. Iida H. Nakamura T. Ito M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26249-26259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). To determine whether the recognized protein does indeed show neutral ceramidase activity, cell lysates from IL-1β-stimulated mesangial cells were separated on a MonoQ column, and fractions were analyzed by Western blotting (Fig.3 A, upper panel) and for neutral ceramidase activity (lower panel). Earlier fractions (fractions 9 and 10) showed an ∼94-kDa protein of still unknown identity that was recognized by the neutral ceramidase antibody. Fractions 11 and 12 showed exclusive expression of a 110–120-kDa protein, the predicted size of rat neutral ceramidase (19Mitsutake S. Tani M. Okino N. Mori K. Ichinose S. Omori A. Iida H. Nakamura T. Ito M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26249-26259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The neutral ceramidase activity was highest in fractions 11 and 12, which also showed the highest protein amounts, thus suggesting that this band is indeed a neutral ceramidase. Furthermore, we investigated whether the antibody could immunoprecipitate a fully active enzyme. As shown in Fig. 3 B, Western blot analysis of the supernatant after immunoprecipitation of neutral ceramidase revealed a disappearance of the protein that was dependent on the antibody dilution used (Fig. 3 B, upper panel). Preimmune serum did not deplete the protein from the supernatant. In parallel, a reduction of neutral ceramidase activity was observed in the supernatant (Fig. 3 B, lower panel). Consistent with a depletion of the enzyme in the supernatant, an increased amount of enzyme was observed in the immunoprecipitates by Western blotting (Fig. 3 C). However, no increased neutral ceramidase activity was recovered in the immunoprecipitates (data not shown). These data suggest that binding of the antibody to its antigen leads to a neutralization of the enzyme activity. Stimulation of mesangial cells with IL-1β led to a marked and time-dependent up-regulation of the neutral ceramidase protein (Fig. 4 A). In contrast, the acid ceramidase protein, which runs at 55 kDa as a holoenzyme under nonreducing conditions (30Bernardo K. Hurwitz R. Zenk T. Desnick R.J. Ferlinz K. Schuchman E.H. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11098-11102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), was not significantly changed (Fig. 4 B). We further investigated whether the up-regulation of neutral ceramidase is due to increased de novo synthesis. For this purpose, mesangial cells were stimulated with IL-1β for different time periods, and [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine were included in the culture medium for the last 4 h of stimulation. Thereafter, the cells were lysed, and the neutral ceramidase was immunoprecipitated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Fig. 5 shows that IL-1β triggered increased de novo synthesis of the neutral ceramidase. A similar increase was also observed with another pro-inflammatory cytokine, TNF-α (Fig. 5). In contrast, the degradation of the neutral ceramidase was not affected by IL-1β treatment (data not shown) as analyzed by pulse-chase experiments. In a next step, we tested whether there is also an induction of the mRNA coding for the neutral ceramidase. Based on the"

Previous studies using thin layer chromatography of 32P-postlabeled DNA digests have detected several bulky oxidative lesions of unknown structure, called I-compounds, in DNA from normal mammalian organs. We investigated whether any of these type II I-compounds contained 8,5′-cyclo-2′-deoxyadenosine (cA). Two previously detected type II I-compounds were found to be dinucleotides of the sequence pAp-cAp and pCp-cAp. Furthermore, a modification of the technique resulted in detection of two additional I-compounds, pTp-cAp and pGp-cAp. Each I-compound isolated from neonatal rat liver DNA matched authentic32P-labeled cA-containing chromatographic standards under nine different chromatographic conditions. Their levels increased significantly after normal birth. The 32P-postlabeling technique used here is capable of detecting 1–5 lesions/diploid mammalian cell. Thus, it should now be possible to detect changes of cA levels resulting from low level ionizing radiation and other conditions associated with oxidative stress, and to assess cA levels in tissues from patients with the genetic disease xeroderma pigmentosum who are unable to carry out nucleotide excision repair. 8,5′-Cyclopurine-2′-deoxynucleotides, which are strong blocks to mammalian DNA and RNA polymerases, represent a novel class of oxidative DNA lesion in that they are specifically repaired by nucleotide excision repair but not by base excision repair or direct enzymatic reversion.

For example, excessive exposure to short wavelength UV radiation in sunlight results in premature aging of the skin, including an increased incidence of skin cancer.

Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995: 24-29Google Scholar). Their identification made possible mechanistic studies leading to the discovery of NER1 (2Setlow R. Carrier W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These lesions have also been implicated in sunlight-induced mutagenesis, carcinogenesis, and apoptosis (5Hart R. Setlow R. Woodhead A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 1994; 372: 773-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar). In contrast to DNA damage caused by exogenous agents such as the short wavelength UV radiation in sunlight, which cannot reach internal organs, cellular DNA is constantly being damaged by oxygen radicals generated as byproducts of endogenous metabolic processes (7Lindahl T.

Understanding the chemical structure of this oxidative damage is important because of its likely role in spontaneous carcinogenesis, neurodegeneration, and aging (7Lindahl T.

Studies of oxidative DNA damage have centered around 8-oxo-dG and thymine glycol, non-bulky DNA lesions subject primarily to BER, although NER has been proposed to play a back-up role (11Reardon J.T. Bessho T. Kung H.C. Bolton P.H. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9463-9468Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). These lesions often serve as an estimate of oxidative DNA damage in mammalian cells (8Ames B.N. Shigenaga M.K. Hagen T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Evidence is accumulating that they play a role in mutagenesis (12Wang D. Kreutzer D. Essigmann J. Mutat.

Recently, attention has focused also on a novel class of oxidative DNA damage that is resistant to BER but requires NER for removal from DNA (15Satoh M.S. Jones C.J. Wood R.D. Lindahl T. Proc. Natl.

The only known members of this class are the cPu, in which C8 of a purine base becomes covalently bound to the C5′ of its own deoxyribose through oxidation by the highly reactive ⋅OH (16Keck K. Z.

Moreover, cPu are strong blocks to DNA polymerase δ in vitro (24Kuraoka I. Bender C. Romieu A. Cadet J. Wood R.D. Lindahl T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Evidence that cPu can be formed in mammalian tissues has recently been presented by Dizdaroglu et al. (25Dizdaroglu M. Jaruga P. Rodriguez H. Free Radic. Biol.

These compounds have been classified into two groups named type I and type II I-compounds (reviewed in Ref. 30Randerath K. Randerath E. Zhou G.-D. Li D. Mutat. Res. 1999; 424: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Although type I I-compounds arise by the reaction of unknown metabolic intermediates with DNA and show age, species, tissue, and gender dependence (30Randerath K. Randerath E. Zhou G.-D. Li D. Mutat. Res. 1999; 424: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), the formation of type II I-compounds has been firmly linked to reactive oxygen species by bothin vitro and in vivo experiments including the exposure to pro-oxidant chemicals (29Randerath K.

The Nu P1 version of the 32P-postlabeling assay (27Reddy M.V. Randerath K. Carcinogenesis. 1986; 7: 1543-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar) detects DNA lesions with the character of bulky DNA adducts. Because cA is an oxidative lesion that has biological properties of a bulky adduct, in the present work we attempted to determine whether there was any relationship between type II I-compounds and cA. In this paper, the term oligonucleotide refers to a polynucleotide of length n > 2. Oligonucleotides containing a single cA and control oligonucleotides were synthesized and characterized as described (23Brooks P.J. Wise D.S. Berry D.A. Kosmoski J.V. Smerdon M.J. Somers R.L.

The sequences of the AcA, CcA, TcA, and GcA oligonucleotides were, respectively, as follows: 5′-GCATCTGTAAAAGCAcATTGTTCCAGGAACC-3′, 5′-AATTCCCGGGGATCCGTCcAACCTGCAGCCAAGCT-3′, 5′-TGGGAG GTCTATcATAAGCAGAGCTCTCTGG-3′, and 5′-CATAGTTACACGcATCTGCGAT-3′. Oligonucleotides were desalted by passage through Sephadex G-25 spin columns, causing 3′-silyl-cA- or 3′-silyl-A-truncated oligonucleotides, formed by incomplete deprotection at the manual desilylation step (23Brooks P.J.

Phosphorylation of the 3′-OH was accomplished using the CPR-II chemical phosphorylation reagent (Glen Research, Sterling, VA) in the final coupling step, and the trityl group was retained. Following deprotection in concentrated NH4OH at 55 °C for 8 h, the dinucleotides were purified by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography, followed by detritylation in 10% acetic acid for 30 min at room temperature. The dinucleotides were dried in a Speed-Vac, dissolved in concentrated NH4OH, and then kept for 30 min at room temperature to remove the phosphate protection group. The solutions were dried, the dinucleotides dissolved in H2O, and, after extraction with ethyl acetate, the aqueous layers containing the dinucleotides were dried in a Speed-Vac. Tissue DNA was isolated from individual F344 rat fetuses or 24-h-old newborn rats (34Randerath E. Zhou G.-D. Randerath K. Carcinogenesis. 1997; 18: 859-866Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by solvent extraction combined with enzymatic digestion of protein and RNA (30Randerath K. Randerath E. Zhou G.-D. Li D. Mutat.

Chromatographic solvents are listed in TableI. The Nu P1-enhanced bisphosphate version of the assay was used for DNA and synthetic polynucleotide analyses (27Reddy M.V. Randerath K. Carcinogenesis. 1986; 7: 1543-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar, 29Randerath K. Yang P.-F. Danna T.F. Reddy R. Watson W.P. Randerath E. Mutat. Res. 1991; 250: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Briefly, as illustrated in Fig. 2, 10 μg of tissue DNA or oligonucleotides containing cA were digested with MN and SPD, yielding Np and Xp deoxyribonucleoside 3′-monophosphates (27Reddy M.V. Randerath K. Carcinogenesis. 1986; 7: 1543-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar), as well as dinucleotides derived from lesions (NcA) (see “Results”). Incubation of these products with Nu P1 dephosphorylated Np but not adducts (27Reddy M.V. Randerath K. Carcinogenesis. 1986; 7: 1543-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar), such as Xp and, as documented herein, NcA. The subsequent32P-labeling step employed T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP to 5′-phosphorylate specifically adducts but not N (27Reddy M.V. Randerath K. Carcinogenesis. 1986; 7: 1543-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar). The radioactive digest was then applied to the origin of a polyethyleneimine-cellulose thin-layer plastic sheet and developed overnight (16 h) in solvent 1 (Fig. 2) or 6 (see below) in order to remove 32P-labeled Pi and ATP. We then used a contact transfer technique (37Lu L.-J.W. Disher R.M. Reddy M.V. Randerath K. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 3046-3054PubMed Google Scholar) to separate adducts present on a lower (L, 2.5 × 1.0 cm) and a central (C, 2.8 × 1.0 cm) cut (Fig. 2, upper right). Sheets were washed in deionized water between developments. This procedure resulted in reproducible two-dimensional patterns of radioactive spots representing oxidative DNA lesions (29Randerath K.

Spots2 and 5 have been underlined because they represented 5′-32P-labeled AcA and CcA, respectively, whereas the structures of the other radiolabeled spots remain unidentified (see “Results”). In some experiments we omitted MN/SPD and Nu P1 digestions in order to assess the resistance of dinucleotides containing cA to nuclease digestion. Detection of GcA and TcA in addition to AcA and CcA was accomplished by using solvent 6 for the overnight purification step and solvent 5 for the second dimension of C maps (see “Results”). 32P-Labeled spots were visualized by screen-enhanced autoradiography using Kodak XAR-5 film and by imaging with an InstantImager (Packard Instruments, Meriden, CT) (27Reddy M.V.

We extracted dinucleotides from two-dimensional TLC maps with 2-propanol/6 n ammonia (1:1, by volume) as described (32Randerath E. Watson W.P. Zhou G.-D. Chang J. Randerath K. Mutat.

Aliquots containing 0.1–0.3 nCi were separated in one dimension individually or as mixtures in solvents 1, 5, and 7–13, then visualized. It may be noted that the solvents chosen operate according to three different principles, i.e. anion exchange on a protonated (39Suh J. Paik H.J. Hwang B.K. Bioorg. Chem. 1994; 22: 318-327Crossref Scopus (359) Google Scholar) stationary medium (nos. 2–4 and 7–12), salting-out of solutes at high phosphate concentration (nos. 1, 5, and 6), and partitioning between a highly alkaline mobile phase and a mostly unprotonated (39Suh J. Paik H.J. Hwang B.K. Bioorg. Chem. 1994; 22: 318-327Crossref Scopus (359) Google Scholar) stationary phase (no. 13). We quantified 32P-labeled compounds with the aid of a Packard InstantImager electronic autoradiography system as described (38Zhou G.-D. Hernandez N.S. Randerath E. Randerath K. Nutr. Cancer. 1999; 35: 87-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Appropriate blank count rates were subtracted from sample values. We estimated the extent of DNA damage by calculating RAL values from sample count rates, the amount of DNA assayed (expressed as picomoles of DNA monomer units or DNA-P), and the specific activity of [γ-32P]ATP according to Ref.27Reddy M.V.

Carcinogenesis. 1986; 7: 1543-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar). Because 100% adduct recovery was not achieved, the RAL value for each lesion was divided by a RF to account for losses inherent in the procedure. Accurate level of lesion (LOL) values were then calculated according to Ref. 27Reddy M.V. Randerath K.

Since LOL × 109 values represent the number of lesions in 109 N and the diploid mammalian cell contains ∼ 12 × 109 N, Equation 4 follows.Lesions/diploid cell=LOL×12Equation 4 Statistical analysis of the data was performed by using the unpaired Student's t test.

Their levels increase in conditions of oxidative stress in vivo (30Randerath K. Randerath E. Zhou G.-D. Li D. Mutat. Res. 1999; 424: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 32Randerath E.

We detected these I-compounds by digesting DNA with nucleases followed by 5′-labeling of the products with carrier-free [γ-32P]ATP and multidimensional TLC, as shown schematically in Fig. 2 (upper left). Typical L and C map profiles are illustrated in Fig. 2(upper right) with six spots numbered. We showed previously that each of the numbered spots is related to oxidative stress, but only spots 2, 3, and 5 can be generated by oxidation of DNA in vitro via the Fenton reaction (29Randerath K. Yang P.-F. Danna T.F. Reddy R. Watson W.P. Randerath E. Mutat. Res. 1991; 250: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 32Randerath E. Watson W.P. Zhou G.-D. Chang J. Randerath K. Mutat.

We detected spots 2 and 5 in all newborn tissues examined (Fig. 2, lower) including skin (data not shown). The intensities of all the spots varied among tissues (Fig.2). Given this information, we asked whether some of these spots contained cA (Fig. 1). To this end, we synthesized four modified oligonucleotides, each containing a different normal nucleotide, i.e. Ap, Cp, Gp, or Tp, 5′ to a single cA. We also synthesized the corresponding dinucleotides containing cA (i.e. AcA, CcA, GcA, TcA). Nuclease treatment of oligonucleotides or dinucleotides containing cA, followed by one-dimensional development with solvent 1 (Fig. 3 A) or 6 (Fig. 3, B and C), resulted in a single major32P-labeled spot from each compound depending on the nucleotide 5′ to the lesion. Di- and oligonucleotides containing normal A in place of cA were completely digested to monomers (27Reddy M.V. Randerath K. Carcinogenesis. 1986; 7: 1543-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar), which moved close to the solvent fronts in solvents 1 and 6 and thus were absent from the maps. On the other hand, omission of enzymatic digestion resulted in a single 32P-labeled spot. In the case of oligonucleotides, the labeled material remained at or near the origin (data not shown), whereas the synthesized dinucleotides containing cA gave the same spots without digestion as the corresponding digested oligonucleotides (Fig. 3). Thus, under our conditions, the cA dinucleotides were resistant to further enzymatic digestion at the 3′,5′-phosphodiester and 3′-monoester bonds. These collective results suggested that the end products of the digestion and 5′-phosphorylation of oligonucleotides containing cA were dinucleotides of the sequence [5′-32P]NcA. Cadet and co-workers (22Romieu A. Gasparutto D. Cadet J. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1999; 12: 412-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) also found, using different techniques, that the presence of cPu confers resistance of dinucleotides to enzymatic digestion. When the initial separation was performed in solvent 1 (Figs.2 and3 A), the spots denoted AcA and CcA migrated in a manner suggesting their identity to previously identified I-compounds 2 and 5 (also called L2 and C5), respectively (34Randerath E. Zhou G.-D. Randerath K. Carcinogenesis. 1997; 18: 859-866Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The other two spots (GcA and TcA) migrated out of the C area with solvent 1 (Fig. 3 A). We eliminated this problem by replacing solvent 1 with solvent 6 (Fig.3 B). In order to establish more firmly that the four oligonucleotide digestion products matched labeled dinucleotides containing 3′-cAp (i.e. [5′-32P]Np-cAp), we used synthesized dinucleotide standards (Fig. 3, C andD). These compounds elicited a pattern (C) without digestion in solvent 6, which resembled that given by the digestion products of oligonucleotides containing cA (B). The results were further confirmed by one-dimensional co-chromatography in nine different conditions (solvents 1, 5, and 7–13; only solvent 7 is shown in D). In each case, the dinucleotide standards matched the labeled oligonucleotide digestion products. We next tested directly the hypothesis that the labeled oligonucle"

This can occur either by apoptosis through active antigen-induced death or cytokine withdrawal. Alternatively, T cell activation can be suppressed by agents that activate the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) signaling pathway, such as prostaglandin E2. Stimulation of PKA inhibits lymphocyte proliferation and immune effector functions. Here we have investigated the mechanism by which activation of PKA induces inhibition of proliferation in human leukemic T cell lines. Using a variety of agents that stimulate PKA, we can arrest Jurkat and H9 leukemic T cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, whereas cell viability is hardly affected. This G1arrest is associated with an inhibition of cyclin D/Cdk and cyclin E/Cdk kinase activity. Interestingly, expression of cyclin D3 is rapidly reduced by PKA activation, whereas expression of the Cdk inhibitor p27kip1 is induced. Ectopic expression of cyclin D3 can override the growth suppression induced by PKA activation to some extent, indicating that growth inhibition of leukemic T cells by PKA activation is partially dependent on down-regulation of cyclin D3 expression. Taken together our data suggest that immunosuppression by protein kinase A involves regulation of both cyclin D3 and p27kip1 expression.

However, the proliferative capacity and effector functions of the evolving T cell population need to be kept in check in order to ensure a restricted reactivity and protect the host from an uncontrolled immune response. To this end, several mechanisms have evolved that can cause deletion or suppression of reactive mature T cells. One mechanism involves apoptosis of the activated T cell population that can occur either via restimulation of the T cell receptor (TCR)1 with the appropriate antigen or through cytokine deprivation (1Lenardo M.

Another mechanism involves suppression of T cell proliferation and effector functions by glucocorticoid hormones and prostaglandins of the E series (PGE) (2Kammer G.M. Immunol. Today. 1988; 9: 222-229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). These agents are thought to regulate the intensity of the immune response at the site of inflammation. For example, PGE2 is secreted by many cell types, such as IL-1-stimulated macrophages, and is a potent activator of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) pathway in lymphocytes (3Phipps R.P. Stein S.H. Roper R.L. Immunol. Today. 1991; 12: 349-352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Stimulation of PKA results in the inhibition of T cell proliferation and dampens T cell effector functions (2Kammer G.M. Immunol. Today. 1988; 9: 222-229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). As such, PGE2 conveys an inhibitory signal to produce a properly tuned immunoreactivity. At the onset of the immune response, resting peripheral T lymphocytes enter the cell cycle from quiescence (Go). At this time D-type cyclins and cyclin E are sequentially synthesized during the G1 interval (4Matsushime H. Roussel M.F. Ashmun R.A. Sherr C.J.

Science. 1993; 259: 1908-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Three D-type cyclins have been identified, of which cyclins D2 and D3 are predominantly expressed in T cells (5Ajchenbaum F. Ando K. DeCaprio J.A. Griffin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4113-4119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Meyerson M. Harlow E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2077-2086Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar). Cyclins D2 and D3 can form an active kinase complex with the cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk)4 or Cdk6, and the resulting kinase complexes are involved in phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (pRb) (8Meyerson M. Harlow E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2077-2086Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar, 9Matsushime H. Ewen M.E. Strom D.K. Kato J. Hanks S.K. Roussel M.F. Sherr J.C. Cell. 1992; 71: 323-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of pRb results in its functional inactivation and allows progression of the cell through the late G1 restriction point and subsequent entry into S phase (10Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4308) Google Scholar). However, induction of cyclin D expression alone is not sufficient to drive resting T cells into S phase. This is due to the fact that resting T cells express abundant amounts of the Cdk inhibitor p27kip1 that associates to the assembled cyclin D/Cdk complexes and inhibits their kinase activity (11Nourse J. Firpo E. Flanagan W.M. Coats S. Polyak K. Lee M.-H. Massague J. Crabtree G.R. Roberts J.M. Nature. 1992; 372: 571-573Google Scholar, 12Firpo E.J. Koff A. Solomon M.J. Roberts J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 14: 4889-4901Crossref Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Expression of p27kip1 is down-regulated as cells progress through G1, but this process requires the presence of a co-stimulatory signal supplied by IL-2 or bib7–1 and bib7–2, the ligands for CD28 (6Boonen G.J. van Dijk A.M. Verdonck L.F. van Lier R.A. Rijksen G. Medema R.H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 789-798Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Nourse J. Firpo E. Flanagan W.M. Coats S. Polyak K. Lee M.-H. Massague J.

Thus, only the combination of T cell receptor (TCR) complex activation and co-stimulation with IL-2 or bib7 molecules allows for the formation of active cyclin D/Cdk complexes and initiation of T cell proliferation. Leukemic T cell lines, such as Jurkat or H9 cells, are not dependent on TCR activation or co-stimulatory signals for their proliferation, and these cells express low levels of p27kip1 (6Boonen G.J. van Dijk A.M. Verdonck L.F. van Lier R.A. Rijksen G. Medema R.H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 789-798Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, cell proliferation can be blocked in these cell lines upon restimulation of the TCR complex, and this is associated with activation-induced cell death (13Boonen G.J. van Oirschot B.A. van Diepen A. Mackus W.J. Verdonck L.F. Rijksen G. Medema R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34676-34682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 14Dhein J. Walczak H. Baumler C. Debatin K.M.

Immunity. 1998; 8: 57-65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). As such, these cells have been used as a model system to study the signaling events triggered by TCR activation that induce apoptosis in cycling T cells. Using these cell lines, we have previously shown that down-regulation of cyclin D3 is crucial to TCR-induced apoptosis (13Boonen G.J. van Oirschot B.A. van Diepen A. Mackus W.J. Verdonck L.F. Rijksen G. Medema R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34676-34682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Here we have used these cell lines as a model to study PKA-mediated immunosuppression. We show that these cells are inhibited in their growth by agents that activate PKA and show that expression of cyclin D3 is down-regulated in leukemic T cell lines in response to activation of PKA. This down-regulation of cyclin D3 plays an important role in the PKA-mediated growth inhibition, since ectopic expression of cyclin D3 could overcome the suppressive effects of PKA to some extent. However, ectopic expression of cyclin D3 was unable to fully prevent the growth suppression that occurred in response to activation of PKA. Indeed, we could show that PKA activation also results in the induction of p27kip1expression, independent of its effect on cyclin D3, indicating that PKA can cause growth suppression in T cells via multiple independent pathways. Human Jurkat and H9 leukemic T cell lines were routinely cultured as described (13Boonen G.J. van Oirschot B.A. van Diepen A. Mackus W.J. Verdonck L.F. Rijksen G. Medema R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34676-34682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Jurkat T cells stably expressing cyclin D3 (clones JD-I and JD-II) have been described previously (13Boonen G.J. van Oirschot B.A. van Diepen A. Mackus W.J. Verdonck L.F. Rijksen G. Medema R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34676-34682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Anti-pRb (G3-245) was obtained from PharMingen (Hamburg, Germany), anti-p27kip1 (clone 57) from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY), anti-cyclin D3 (Ab-2) from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA), anti-Cdk2 (M2), anti-cyclin E (HE-12 for immunoblotting and HE-111 for immunoprecipitation and in vitro kinase activity) were all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-cyclin D2 (DCS-5) was a kind gift from Dr. Jiri Lukas (Danish Cancer Society, Copenhagen, Denmark). Propidium iodide,N-6,2′-O-dibutyryl-cAMP (dibutyryl cAMP) and 8-bromo-cAMP were purchased from Sigma, and protein A/G-Sepharose beads from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. All cells were plated in fresh medium at a density of 2 × 105 cells/ml at 24 h prior to cell stimulation to ensure that they were growing exponentially at the time of stimulation. Cells were counted the next day and replated in the presence or absence of forskolin, dibutyryl cAMP, and 8-bromo-cAMP at the indicated concentrations or on plates coated with anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) (UCHT-1) as previously described (13Boonen G.J. van Oirschot B.A. van Diepen A. Mackus W.J. Verdonck L.F. Rijksen G. Medema R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34676-34682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Cells were plated at a density of 2 × 105 cells/ml in 96-well plates and grown with or without forskolin, dibutyryl cAMP, or 8-bromo-cAMP for the indicated times. Alternatively, cells were plated on anti-CD3-coated 96-well plates and grown for the indicated times. During the last 2 h, 0.5 μCi [3H]thymidine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added to each well, after which cells were harvested and [ 3H]thymidine incorporation was determined in a scintillation counter. To determine which phase of the cell cycle was affected by activation of protein kinase A or TCR activation, cells were grown at a density of 2 × 105cells/ml on 12-well tissue culture plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA) and treated with forskolin or anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies or left untreated. At different time points after the stimulation, cells were collected and washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, after which they were fixed overnight in 70% ethanol at 4 °C. Cells were then pelleted by centrifugation, and cell pellets were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were stained with propidium iodide as described (13Boonen G.J. van Oirschot B.A. van Diepen A. Mackus W.J. Verdonck L.F. Rijksen G. Medema R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34676-34682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Cell viability after stimulation for different time periods with forskolin or anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies was determined by staining whole cells with propidium iodide as described (13Boonen G.J. van Oirschot B.A. van Diepen A. Mackus W.J. Verdonck L.F. Rijksen G. Medema R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34676-34682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Samples were analyzed on a FACScalibur and cell viability was subsequently determined using Cell Quest software (BD PharMingen). Cells were stimulated with forskolin or anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies or left unstimulated and harvested at the indicated time points. Cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and cell pellets were resuspended and lysed in E1A lysis buffer as described previously (6Boonen G.J. van Dijk A.M. Verdonck L.F. van Lier R.A. Rijksen G. Medema R.H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 789-798Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined, and equal amounts of protein were used for immunoprecipitation, using 100 μg of whole cell lysate, 20 μl of protein A/G-Sepharose beads with 4 μl of anti-cyclin E antibody, or 2 μl of anti-Cdk2 antibody. The resulting immunocomplexes were washed three times with ELB lysis buffer and used in in vitro kinase assays using histone H1 as substrate as described previously (16Medema R.H. Klompmaker R. Smits V.A. Rijksen G. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 431-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Samples were analyzed on SDS-PAGE gels and exposed to PhosphorImager plates (Molecular Dynamics). After proper stimulation, cells were harvested and washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cell pellets were then lysed in 2× Laemmli buffer without β-mercaptoethanol and bromphenol blue. Samples were then incubated at 95 °C for 5 min. Protein concentrations were determined using a standard Lowry protein determination, after which β-mercaptoethanol and bromphenol blue were added to final concentrations of 10 and 0.01%, respectively. Samples were then separated on appropriate SDS-PAGE gels and blotted to a nitrocellulose membrane. Proteins were then detected by ECL using standard protocols. Activation of PKA can suppress T cell activation and causes growth inhibition in a large variety of lymphocytes, including leukemic T cell lines. We set out to study the mechanism of PKA-mediated growth inhibition in more detail. To this end, we stimulated Jurkat leukemic T cells with a variety of agents known to activate PKA. Treatment of Jurkat T cells with forskolin, which directly activates the catalytic subunit of adenylate cyclase, resulted in marked inhibition of proliferation, as measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation (Fig.1 A). A similar inhibition was seen after addition of dibutyryl cAMP or 8-bromo-cAMP (Fig.1 A), both membrane-permeable cAMP analogs known to efficiently stimulate PKA activity when added to cells. Inhibition of cell proliferation in response to forskolin or dibutyryl cAMP was apparent as early as 8 h after stimulation and reached >75% inhibition after 24 h (Fig. 1 B). Inhibition of [3H]thymidine incorporation was dependent on the concentration of forskolin added to the cells (Fig. 1 C). Because 50 μm forskolin caused an efficient growth inhibition, we chose to use this concentration in our further experiments. In addition to immunosuppression by agents that modulate the activity of PKA, tolerance of mature T lymphocytes can be induced through antigen-driven cell death (1Lenardo M. Chan K.M. Hornung F. McFarland H. Siegel R. Wang J. Zheng L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 221-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). This latter process has been studied extensively in leukemic T cell lines that undergo apoptosis upon direct activation of the TCR complex (13Boonen G.J. van Oirschot B.A. van Diepen A. Mackus W.J.

Immunity. 1998; 8: 57-65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Therefore, we compared growth inhibition mediated by PKA with that observed in response to TCR activation. To this end we incubated cells with a cross-linked anti-CD3 mAb in increasing concentrations (13Boonen G.J. van Oirschot B.A. van Diepen A. Mackus W.J. Verdonck L.F. Rijksen G. Medema R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34676-34682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and could observe an efficient inhibition of [3H]thymidine incorporation after a 24 h stimulation, similar to the effects of forskolin (Fig.1 D). Similar to PKA-induced inhibition, the suppression of thymidine incorporation was visible as early as 8 h after stimulation with UCHT-1 and reached ∼75% after 24 h (Fig.1 E). Cross-linking of the CD3 complex on leukemic T cell lines can result in programmed cell death (13Boonen G.J. van Oirschot B.A. van Diepen A. Mackus W.J. Verdonck L.F. Rijksen G. Medema R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34676-34682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 14Dhein J. Walczak H. Baumler C. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Nature. 1995; 373: 438-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (1606) Google Scholar, 15Lissy N.A. Van Dyk L.F. Becker-Hapak M. Vocero-Akbani A. Mendler J.H. Dowdy S.F. Immunity. 1998; 8: 57-65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and we previously showed that the TCR-induced growth inhibition of Jurkat cells is in part due to a reduction in cell viability (13Boonen G.J. van Oirschot B.A. van Diepen A. Mackus W.J. Verdonck L.F. Rijksen G. Medema R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34676-34682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Therefore, we wanted to determine the contribution of cell death to the growth inhibition seen upon activation of PKA. To this end, we cultured the cells in the presence of forskolin for 24 or 48 h and measured cell viability by propidium iodide uptake. Under these experimental conditions, forskolin induced only minor increases in the percentage of dead cells (from 4 to 6% after 48 h) (Fig.2 A), indicating that the effect of PKA cannot be explained by programmed cell death in these cells. In the same experiments, we observed a more significant increase in the number of dead cells in response to TCR activation, from 4% in the control population to 27% after 48 h (Fig.2 A). Because activation of PKA induced a significant growth inhibition in the absence of apoptosis, we decided to study the effects of PKA activation on the cell cycle progression in more detail. We, therefore, stimulated Jurkat cells for 24 or 48 h with forskolin and analyzed the DNA profiles using propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the percentage of cells in the G0/G1 phase rises from 39 to 52% within 16 h of forskolin treatment and reaches ∼63% at 24 h after treatment. As can been seen in Fig. 2 B, the fraction of cells with a sub-G1 DNA content (apoptotic cells) remains unchanged after treatment with forskolin (Fig. 2 B), consistent with our data on cell viability (Fig. 2 A). Stimulation with anti-CD3 mAbs resulted in a similar increase in the percentage of cells in G1 (Fig. 2 B). In contrast with forskolin, anti-CD3 mAbs induced a clear increase in the fraction of apoptotic cells (<2n), from 6% in the unstimulated cells to 19% in the cells stimulated for 24 h, similar to the percentages obtained by measuring cell viability. To investigate at which point in G1 cells arrest in response to PKA activation, we examined the phosphorylation state of pRb after treatment of cells with forskolin. In untreated, asynchronous cultures of Jurkat cells, pRb is mostly present in its slower migrating hyperphosphorylated form (Fig.3 A, lane 1). After 24 h of stimulation with forskolin we observed a clear mobility shift in the pRb protein from the hyperphosphorylated to the hypophosphorylated form (Fig. 3 A,lane 2). In order to rule out that these effects of PKA activation were restricted to Jurkat leukemic cells, we analyzed the effects of PKA activation on pRb phosphorylation in another human leukemic cell line, H9. Indeed, proliferation of H9 leukemic cells was also efficiently inhibited by forskolin (data not shown), and a similar inhibition of pRb phosphorylation was observed in response to forskolin (Fig. 3 A, lanes 3 and4). Phosphorylation of pRb is mediated by cyclin/Cdk complexes (10Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4308) Google Scholar), and therefore, we measured the kinase activity of cyclin E-Cdk2 complexes, normally induced late in G1. For this purpose, cyclin E or Cdk2 were immunoprecipitated from whole cell lysates prepared from control and forskolin- or anti-CD3-stimulated Jurkat or H9 cells. The obtained immunocomplexes were then subjected to in vitro kinase reactions using histone H1 as a substrate. After a 24 h stimulation with forskolin or anti-CD3 mAbs, both cyclin E as well as Cdk2-associated kinase activity were inhibited (Fig.3 B). Expression of cyclin E and Cdk2 were unaltered upon stimulation with forskolin or anti-CD3 mAbs (Fig. 3 C), demonstrating that regulation of cyclin E expression is not involved in the inhibition of cyclin E-Cdk2 kinase activity. In addition to phosphorylation by cyclin E-Cdk2, Rb phosphorylation also requires the activity of cyclin D-Cdk4 or -Cdk6 complexes (17Lundberg A.S. Weinberg R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 753-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). Cyclin D/Cdk complexes phosphorylate residues on pRb that are distinct from the residues phosphorylated by cyclin E- or cyclin A-Cdk2 complexes (18Kitagawa M. Higashi H. Jung H.K. Suzuki-Takahashi I. Ikeda M. Tamai K. Kato J. Segawa K. Yoshida E. Nishimura S. Taya Y. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7060-7069Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). For example, Ser780 is uniquely phosphorylated by cyclin D/Cdk complexes, and its phosphorylation state is, therefore, a good measure of cyclin D/Cdk kinase activity. Using an antibody recognizing Ser780-phosphorylated pRb (anti-phospho-Ser780), we noted that treatment of Jurkat cells with forskolin for 24 h resulted in the loss of phosphorylated pRbSer780, similar to what was observed after stimulation with anti-CD3 mAbs (Fig. 3 D). These experiments clearly demonstrate that PKA stimulation results in the loss of cyclin D- and cyclin E-associated kinase activities from the cell. We have previously shown that Jurkat and H9 cells express abundant amounts of cyclin D3 but no cyclin D2 and that its expression is down-regulated upon activation of the TCR (13Boonen G.J. van Oirschot B.A. van Diepen A. Mackus W.J. Verdonck L.F. Rijksen G. Medema R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34676-34682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Therefore, we next decided to analyze the effect of PKA activation on expression of the cyclin D3. Expression of cyclin D3 was dramatically reduced after 24 h in the presence of forskolin or anti-CD3 mAbs in Jurkat and H9 cells (Fig.4 A). The timing of cyclin D3 down-regulation appears to be similar after stimulation with anti-CD3 mAbs or forskolin. In both cases, a reduction in cyclin D3 expression is first visible after 8 h of stimulation and expression continues to decline up to 24 h (Fig. 4 B). This timing slightly precedes the decrease in Ser780 dephosphorylation on pRb (Fig. 4 C), suggesting that the reduction in cyclin D3 expression is responsible for the observed pRb dephosphorylation. To examine if changes in the levels of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (Cdki) contribute to the observed inhibition of cyclin/Cdk activity, we examined if PKA activation could induce expression of p27kip1 or p21cip1 in leukemic T cells. Whole cell lysates were prepared from control cells and from cells stimulated for 24 h with anti-CD3 mAbs or forskolin. As shown in Fig. 4 D, expression of p27kip1 did not change significantly upon activation of the T cells with anti-CD3 mAbs. In contrast, stimulation of PKA did result in an increase in p27kip1 protein levels. Induction of p27kip1 in response to activation of PKA was visible after 2 h of stimulation with forskolin, indicating that this is a rather rapid response (Fig.4 E). We next checked expression of p21cip1 but could not detect p21cip1 in control or forskolin-stimulated Jurkat cells (data not shown), nor in cells treated with anti-CD3 mAbs (13Boonen G.J. van Oirschot B.A. van Diepen A. Mackus W.J. Verdonck L.F. Rijksen G. Medema R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34676-34682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Thus, it seems unlikely that induced expression of p21cip1causes the observed inhibition of cyclin/Cdk complexes in response to TCR or PKA activation, but it appears that PKA-mediated growth inhibition is due to combined regulation of both cyclin D3 and p27kip1 expression. We have previously shown that the TCR-induced growth arrest in Jurkat cells is critically dependent on down-regulation of cyclin D3. In order to investigate if the PKA-induced growth suppression shows a similar dependence, we studied PKA-mediated growth inhibition in Jurkat-derived cell lines stably overexpressing cyclin D3. To this end, we transfected a plasmid encoding human cyclin D3 into Jurkat cells and isolated single cell colonies by limiting dilution. Of several lines isolated, two lines were selected for further studies, JD3.I and JD3.II, which express moderate levels of exogenous cyclin D3 (13Boonen G.J. van Oirschot B.A. van Diepen A. Mackus W.J. Verdonck L.F. Rijksen G. Medema R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34676-34682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To confirm that cyclin D3 was indeed constitutively expressed in these cell lines, also in the presence of forskolin, we analyzed cyclin D3 expression by Western blot analysis. Whereas cyclin D3 is efficiently down-regulated in the parental Jurkat cell line, no effect on cyclin D3 expression by forskolin or anti-CD3 mAbs is seen in JD3.I or JD3.II (Fig.5 A). As can be seen in Fig.5 C, the growth inhibitory response to anti-CD3 mAbs was almost completely abolished when we measured [3H]thymidine incorporation in the JD3.I and JD3.II clones, consistent with our previous report (13Boonen G.J. van Oirschot B.A. van Diepen A. Mackus W.J. Verdonck L.F. Rijksen G. Medema R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34676-34682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In contrast, although a significant reduction in the forskolin-induced inhibition of thymidine incorporation was observed in JD3.I and JD3.II, ectopic expression of cyclin D3 was unable to fully revert growth inhibition by forskolin. These data show that down-regulation of cyclin D3 plays an important role in both TCR- and PKA-mediated growth suppression, but also indicate that PKA must affect other cell cycle regulatory proteins besides cyclin D3. Our data suggest that this other pathway involves regulation of p27kip1 (see Fig. 4 D). p27kip1binds to multiple G1 cyclin/Cdk complexes and is a potent Cdk inhibitor for complexes containing Cdk2, although it does not seem to inhibit cyclin D/Cdk complexes (19Sherr C.J. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3689-3695PubMed Google Scholar). As such, p27kip1 can inhibit cell cycle progression in G1 by inhibition of cyclin/Cdk complexes other than cyclin D-Cdk4 or -Cdk6, such as cyclin E-Cdk2. Thus, regulation of p27kip1 expression, independent from cyclin D, could very well constitute a separate pathway of growth inhibition in these PKA-stimulated T cell lines. Indeed, when analyzing p27kip1 expression, we found that the ability of forskolin to induce p27kip1 expression was retained in the JD3.I and JD3.II clones (Fig. 5 B), demonstrating that regulation of p27kip1 by PKA occurs independently of its effects on cyclin D3 expression. Agents that activate the PKA signaling cascade act in vivo to down-regulate the immune response in order to prevent excessive reactivity. In this report we have addressed the mechanism of suppression of T cell proliferation in response to activation of PKA. To this end, we have used leukemic T cell lines that are no longer dependent on activating stimuli for their proliferation. Rather, these T cell lines resemble activated mature T cells, in that apoptosis can be induced upon activation of the TCR complex, and their proliferation is dramatically inhibited by agents that cause a rise in the intracellular cAMP levels. These properties allowed us to use these cell lines to study PKA-mediated immunosuppression in more detail and to compare this to immunosuppression by stimulation of the TCR complex on the same T cell lines. We could show that the PKA-mediated block in cell proliferation was due to an arrest of cell cycle progression at some point in the G1 phase, but no dramatic reduction in cell viability was observed. The G1 arrest induced by forskolin was associated with the appearance of dephosphorylated pRb, indicating an arrest at, or prior to, the G1 restriction point. In agreement with this notion was the finding that the kinase activity of cyclin E and Cdk2 complexes was reduced. In order to address the mechanism by which the reduction in kinase activity of these complexes occurs, we analyzed expression of the various G1 cyclins. Expression of cyclin E is usually induced late in G1 as a function of cell cycle progression. No reduction in the expression level of cyclin E could be detected within 24 h after treatment with forskolin, indicating that the initial inhibition of cyclin E-associated kinase occurs through active repression. Therefore, these data indicate that the reduction in cyclin E-associated kinase activity is not a mere consequence of the arrest in G1 but is affected more directly by PKA activation. Further analysis of expression of G1 cyclins showed that expression of cyclin D3 was reduced significantly after treatment with forskolin. The reduction in cyclin D3 expression was correlated with a loss of cyclin D-specific pRb phosphorylation, as measured by Ser780 phosphorylation. Since expression of the D-type cyclins is not a function of cell cycle progression but depends on the presence of sufficient mitogens in the cellular environment (20Sherr C.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 187-190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar), it is very unlikely that the reduction in cyclin D3 expression is a secondary effect of the induced arrest in G1. Rather, these data indicate that the arrest in G1 is caused by the reduction in expression of cyclin D3, which will result in inhibition of pRb phosphorylation and a block in cell cycle progression. Indeed, ectopic expression of cyclin D3 could prevent the forskolin-induced growth suppression of Jurkat cells to some extent. The effect of cyclin D3 on repression of PKA-mediated inhibition of proliferation was not as extensive as seen in response to TCR activation, indicating that PKA affects other cell cycle regulatory proteins in addition to cyclin D3. Analysis of the expression of other cell cycle regulatory proteins that play a role in the progression from G1 to S phase showed that expression of the Cdk inhibitor p27kip1 is induced after stimulation with forskolin. This rise in p27kip1 occurs independently of the reduction of cyclin D3, since it is not seen in response to TCR activation and, more importantly, is not affected in the JD3.I and JD3.II cell lines that fail to down-regulate cyclin D3 in response to forskolin. At this point, we cannot completely rule out the possibility that the effects of PKA on p27kip1 are an indirect consequence of cell cycle arrest. However, expression of p27kip1 is not induced by TCR activation, although this leads to a similar block in proliferation. Also, the rapid kinetics of p27kip1 induction would argue against this possibility. Thus, regulation of p27kip1 expression appears to distinguish the PKA-mediated growth suppression from TCR-mediated inhibition of leukemic T cell growth. Taken together, our data indicate that PKA activation in leukemic T cell lines affects multiple pathways to elicit an efficient inhibition of proliferation. Interference with one of the PKA targets, namely cyclin D3, is not sufficient to fully override growth suppression, indicating that other targets play an equally important role in the PKA response. It was recently reported that PKA activation can also affect cyclin D3 expression in primary T lymphocytes (21Naderi S. Gutzkow K.B. Christoffersen J. Smeland E.B. Blomhoff H.K. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 1757-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, p27kip1levels were not rapidly induced after PKA activation in primary T lymphocytes, although we find induction of p27kip1 expression as early as 2 h after stimulation with forskolin in leukemic T cells. This discrepancy could be due to a fundamental difference in PKA-mediated growth suppression in primary lymphocytesversus the leukemic T cell lines studied here. Unfortunately, the importance of down-regulation of cyclin D3 to PKA-mediated growth suppression of primary T lymphocytes has not been addressed, making it impossible to draw conclusions as to the existence of other potential PKA targets in primary T cells. Nevertheless, our experiments have clearly shown that down-regulation of cyclin D3 is not solely responsible for PKA-mediated growth suppression of leukemic T cells, because a failure to down-regulate cyclin D3 does not result in a complete loss of responsiveness to forskolin. The data presented here suggest that one other crucial target may be p27kip1, which is induced upon activation of PKA in the leukemic cell lines studied here. Regulation of p27kip1 expression in a fashion independent from cyclin D expression, as seen here for PKA activation in Jurkat T cells, truly constitutes a separate pathway of growth suppression. Although p27kip1 binds with high affinity to cyclin D/Cdk complexes, it is clear that these complexes remain catalytically active, even in the presence of high levels of p27kip1 (22Blain S.W. Montalvo E. Massague J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25863-25872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 23LaBaer J. Garrett M.D. Stevenson L.F. Slingerland J.M. Sandhu C. Chou H.S. Fattaey A. Harlow E. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 847-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar). In contrast, cyclin E-Cdk2 complexes are very efficiently inhibited by p27kip1 (19Sherr C.J. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3689-3695PubMed Google Scholar). Based on these observations, it has been proposed that cyclin D/Cdk complexes function to sequester p27kip1 away from cyclin E-Cdk2 complexes (19Sherr C.J. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3689-3695PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, whereas down-regulation of cyclin D3 expression by PKA will inhibit G1 progression at the level of cyclin D activity, up-regulation of p27kip1will exert its inhibition at the level of cyclin E-associated kinase activity. This way, activation of PKA can lead to a more tight suppression of T cell proliferation, responsible for the efficient immunosuppressive activities of agents known to activate PKA in T lymphocytes. It will be interesting to determine at which point after PKA activation this bifurcation toward cyclin D3 and p27kip1occurs, and future experiments will be directed toward a better understanding of the mechanism by which PKA can exert its effects on p27kip1 expression.

Essentially all functions of CD47 require both the Ig and MMS domains, raising the possibility that interaction between the two domains is required for normal function. Conservation of Cys residues among CD47 homologues suggested the existence of a disulfide bond between the Ig and MMS domains that was confirmed by chemical digestion and mapped to Cys33 and Cys263. Subtle changes in CD47 conformation in the absence of the disulfide were suggested by decreased binding of two anti-Ig domain monoclonal antibodies, decreased SIRPα1 binding, and reduced CD47/SIRPα1-mediated cell adhesion. Mutagenesis to prevent formation of this disulfide completely disrupted CD47 signaling independent of effects on ligand binding, as assessed by T cell interleukin-2 secretion and Ca2+responses. Loss of the disulfide did not affect membrane raft localization of CD47 or its association with αvβ3 integrin. Thus, a disulfide bond between the Ig and MMS domains of CD47 is required for normal ligand binding and signal transduction.

A detailed understanding of how specific plasma membrane molecules transduce information from the extracellular milieu to the cytoplasm and how these are spatially and temporally integrated is required to begin to understand, predict, and potentially regulate these responses in normal and pathologic conditions. Two major models of transmembrane signal transduction in response to ligand binding have been advanced. For many Ig family and growth factor receptors, signaling is initiated by receptor clustering. Other receptors, like the heptaspanin family of heterotrimeric G protein-coupled receptors, seem to signal ligand binding through conformational changes in the membrane-spanning domain that lead ultimately to the activation of effector cascades. CD47 is an Ig superfamily member involved in signaling from both cell-cell and cell-ECM interactions. Coligation of CD47 and the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) is a synergistic signal for activation of T lymphocytes (1Reinhold M.I. Lindberg F.P. Kersh G.J. Allen P.M. Brown E.J. J. Exp.

In addition, CD47 can exist in a plasma membrane complex with the integrin αvβ3 or α2β1that both modulates integrin function and has signal transduction properties distinct from either CD47 or the integrin in isolation (4Green J.M.

CD47-deficient mice or cells show a variety of abnormalities consistent with a significant role for this molecule in modulating cell responses to adhesive stimuli. Since CD47 is an Ig family member that can in at least some circumstances signal via heterotrimeric G proteins, the paradigm for signal transduction through this interesting molecule is uncertain. CD47 is an unusual member of the Ig superfamily because, in addition to a single Ig domain, it has a highly hydrophobic, multiply membrane-spanning (MMS) domain that is thought to contain five transmembrane segments (15Lindberg F.P. Gresham H.D. Schwarz E. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 485-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Structure-function studies have demonstrated that both the Ig domain and the MMS domain of CD47 are essential for its role in signal transduction as well as for localization of CD47 to the cholesterol-rich plasma membrane domains known as glycosphingolipid-enriched membranes (gems) or rafts (1Reinhold M.I. Lindberg F.P. Kersh G.J. Allen P.M. Brown E.J. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 2Reinhold M.I. Green J.M. Lindberg F.P. Ticchioni M. Brown E.J.

Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 673-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Chimeric molecules in which the CD8 Ig domain or the FLAG epitope was substituted for CD47's Ig were mislocalized and nonfunctional, even when the new extracellular domain was ligated by appropriate antibodies (3Rebres R.A. Green J.M. Reinhold M.I. Ticchioni M. Brown E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7672-7680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This requirement for its specific Ig domain is unlike those of more conventional Ig superfamily signaling molecules (16Kolanus W. Romeo C. Seed B. Cell. 1993; 74: 171-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) and suggests that CD47 aggregation is insufficient to initiate signaling. Thus, the Ig domain plays a fundamental role in CD47 signal transduction in addition to its binding of the ligands thrombospondin and SIRPα1, which suggests the possibility that the CD47 Ig domain is required for a signaling-competent conformation of the molecule. The purpose of the present study was to determine the reason for the requirement for the CD47 Ig domain in its signaling function. We have found that there is a long range disulfide bond between Cys33 and Cys263 in human CD47 that is required for signal transduction as well as for normal SIRPα1 binding. Moreover, the cysteines involved in this long range disulfide are conserved in all species' CD47 paralogs and in the poxvirus molecules of unknown function with structural homology to CD47. The unusual requirement for the CD47 Ig domain in signaling function can be explained at least in part by its interaction with the MMS domain, leading to appropriate conformation not only for ligand binding but for association with intracellular signaling cascades as well.

Secondary antibodies goat anti-mouse IgG (ICN/Cappel, Durham, NC), rabbit anti-mouse IgG (+/−) FITC (Sigma), and goat anti-human IgG Fc (+/−) FITC (Sigma) were commercially available. Streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase was purchased from Sigma. Methyl-β-cyclodextrin was from Aldrich. Magentic beads for cell sorting were from Dynal Biotech (Lake Success, NY) or Miltenyi Biotec (Auburn, CA). Chimeric forms of CD47 were made with standard molecular techniques and have been described previously (1Reinhold M.I. Lindberg F.P. Kersh G.J. Allen P.M. Brown E.J. J. Exp.

CD47/GPI contains the CD47 Ig domain with a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor. FLAG-MMS and CD8-MMS include a FLAG epitope tag or murine CD8α Ig domain, respectively, linked to the MMS domain of CD47. Fig. 1 A shows a schematic model of CD47 indicating the sites of designed MMS domain mutations. All mutations were constructed using standard molecular techniques. All products from PCR were confirmed by sequencing in both directions. The mutant, termed first ICL (1 st ICL), replaces163KTLKYRSGGMDEK175 (all amino acid numbering based on immature CD47) with KAAAAAKAAAAAK. The second ICL mutation (2 nd ICL) replaces234LTS236 with KKK. The third transmembrane mutation (3 rd TM) replaces224HYY226 with AAA. The Cys/Ser mutants replace Cys residues at 33, 259, and/or 263 with Ser, as indicated. cDNA encoding the extracellular three Ig domains of human SIRPα1 (SHPS-1) was obtained as IMAGE clone number 2017171. It was modified and transferred by standard molecular techniques into pCDM8 containing the coding sequence of the hinge and constant regions of the heavy chain of human IgG1 (20Aruffo A. Stamenkovic I. Melnick M. Underhill C.B. Seed B. Cell. 1990; 61: 1303-1313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2155) Google Scholar). SIRPα1-Fc fusion protein was produced by transient transfection of COS cells or stable transfection of 293 cells using lipofectamine/PLUS reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Protein was harvested from culture supernatants using Protein A-Sepharose and confirmed to exist as a dimer by Western blot with anti-human IgG-Fc (apparent molecular mass of ∼130 kDa). SIRPα1/CD7 was constructed from the modified IMAGE clone and pIAP323, which contains the CD7 transmembrane domain (5Lindberg F.P. Gresham H.D. Reinhold M.I. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1313-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). It consists of the three extracellular Ig domains of SIRPα1 linked to the transmembrane domain of CD7. Jurkat and JinB8 cells were transfected by electroporation at 280 V, 1000 microfarads, and 25 °C in RPMI and immediately placed on ice. After 10 min, cells were placed in nonselective medium for 24 h and then transferred to medium containing 1.5 mg/ml Geneticin. OV10 cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE reagent. After 24 h, cells were passed into medium containing 400 μg/ml Geneticin. None of the mutations prevented surface expression, and all cells were sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting or magnetic bead methods to isolate positive populations of equal expression level (Fig.1 B). CD47 was isolated from human placenta as previously described (17Brown E.J. Hooper L. Ho T. Gresham H.D. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2785-2794Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Briefly, tissue was minced and homogenized in 50 mm Tris, 0.25 msucrose, 5 mm iodoacetamide, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin (pH 7.4). Membrane fractions were prepared from the cleared homogenate, dissolved in homogenization buffer with 80 mm β-d-octyl glucoside, and incubated with anti-CD47 Sepharose. Anti-CD47-Sepharose was washed with low and high salt CHAPS buffers (150 or 500 mm NaCl, 25 mm Hepes, 10 mm CHAPS, 3 mmCa2+, 1 mm Mg2+, 25 μm paranitrophenyl paraguanidinobenzoate, pH 7.4), and bound material was eluted with 10 mm CHAPS in 500 mm NaCl, 100 mm glycine, pH 3.3, and neutralized with one-tenth volume of 1 m Tris (pH 9.0). Eluted material was then dialyzed against low salt CHAPS buffer, reapplied to the anti-CD47 Sepharose, eluted, and dialyzed as described. Aliquots of isolated CD47 were lyophilized and redissolved in 1% acetic acid. Three volumes of 1 mg/ml BNPS-skatole in glacial acetic acid were added, and the mixture was incubated in the dark at 25 °C for 24 h. The digest was diluted 1:1 with water and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min to remove precipitated BNPS-skatole. The supernatant was concentrated in a Speedvac evaporator (Savant) to reduce volume and remove residual acetic acid and treated with Tricine sample buffer (0.1 mTris, 24% glycerol, 8% SDS, 0.02% Coomassie Blue G-250) with or without 200 mm dithiothreitol for 40 min at 40 °C. Samples were run on Tris-Tricine gels, blotted to Immobilon-P-SQ membranes (Millipore Corp.), and probed with mAb 131. A similar method of affinity isolation of JinB8 transfectant CD47 was performed for endoproteinase Arg-C digests. Briefly, cells were treated with 20 mm iodoacetamide in PBS in the dark at 0 °C for 45 min and then lysed in 10 mm CHAPS, 10 mmiodoacetamide, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride in PBS (pH 7.4) at 4 °C for 30 min. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 ×g, and CD47 protein was immunoprecipitated with anti-CD47-Sepharose, washed, eluted, and dialyzed as described (17Brown E.J. Hooper L. Ho T. Gresham H.D. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2785-2794Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Digests were performed in 10 mm CHAPS, 0.1 mHepes (pH 8.2), with 20 μg/ml protein sequencing grade endoproteinase Arg-C (Sigma) for 1 h at 37 °C. Samples were then treated with Laemmli sample buffer with or without β-mercaptoethanol at 60 °C for 15 min, run on 4–20% gradient SDS-PAGE gels, blotted to polyvinylidene difluoride, and probed with mAb 151. For evaluation of the trypsin sensitivity of the CD47 mutants, cells were pretreated with 10 mm iodoacetamide in PBS for 15 min on ice, lysed in 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris, 140 mm NaCl, 10 mm iodoacetamide, 2 mmEDTA, pH 8.2, for 30 min and centrifuged at 14,000 × gfor 5 min. The cleared whole cell lysates were then digested with trypsin at 2.5 mg/ml for 30 min at 37 °C, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer and incubation at 60 °C for 15 min. Samples were then Western blotted with anti-CD47 Ig domain-specific mAb B6H12. For assessment of binding of SIRPα1-Fc protein, cells were incubated with SIRPα1-Fc fusion protein, anti-CD47, or control mAb in PBS with 1% bovine serum albumin for 30 min on ice, washed, and labeled with anti-human IgG-Fc-FITC or anti-mouse IgG-FITC. Samples were then analyzed on a flow cytometer, and the mean fluorescence was determined, from which a ratio of SIRPα1/CD47 fluorescence was calculated. For examination of mAb 10G2 binding, cells were pretreated with 100 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate plus 2 μmionomycin for 18 h prior to analysis, and the percentage of positive staining was calculated. For treatment with methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD), cells were harvested in PBS with 5 mm EDTA, washed once with PBS and once with Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium plus 0.1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin. Cells were then resuspended at 2.5 × 105cells/ml with or without 10 mm MβCD, incubated at 37 °C for 10–15 min, and washed with Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium plus fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin. Samples were then processed for flow cytometry as described. JinB8 cells transfected with CD47 mutants were loaded with carboxy-SNARF-1 AM (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), and JinB8 cells transfected with SIRPα1/CD7 or vector were loaded with CellTracker Green CMFDA (5-chloromethylfluorescein diacetate) (Molecular Probes). Cells expressing normal CD47 or mutants were next incubated with anti-CD47 (2D3)-coated 4.5 μm magnetic beads (Dynal), and 1 × 105 of these cells were added to a 24-well plate well along with 1 × 105SIRPα1/CD7 cells in 1 ml of RPMI medium. After incubation for 1–8 h, cells were transferred to Eppendorf tubes, and bead-bound cells were separated with a magnet. Approximately 75% of SNARF-1-labeled (CD47+) cells were isolated by this procedure. Magnet-associated cells were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 145 mm NaCl, and cleared lysates were evaluated in a fluorescence plate reader at SNARF-1 and CellTracker Green wavelengths versus standards of known cell number. Adhesion indices were calculated as the ratios of green (SIRPα1/CD7-expressing) to red (CD47-expressing) cells adherent to the magnet after correction for background (SIRPα1-independent adhesion) by subtracting the adhesion index for SIRPα1/CD7-deficient cells (typically ∼10% of the adhesion of the SIRPα1/CD7-expressing cells). A typical adhesion index for cells expressing wild type CD47 was 0.5, which represented 1 SIRPα1/CD7+ cell pulled down per 2 CD47+ cells. All experimental points were assayed in triplicate. Human CD47-transfected murine 3.L2 T cells were stimulated by murine CH27 B cells presenting peptide antigen at varied doses as previously described (1Reinhold M.I. Lindberg F.P. Kersh G.J. Allen P.M. Brown E.J. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 × 1053.L2 cells, 1 × 104 CH27 cells, and 0.03–1 μm antigenic peptide (amino acids 64–76 of hemoglobind (21Evavold B.D. Williams S.G. Hsu B.L. Buus S. Allen P.M. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 347-353PubMed Google Scholar)) were added in RPMI medium to the wells of 96-well plates and incubated for 18–24 h at 37 °C. An IL-2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed on harvested supernatants according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pharmingen). Duplicate samples were assayed, each in at least three replicates of each experiment. Jurkat or JinB8 cells at 2 × 107cells/ml in RPMI complete medium were incubated with 3 μm fura-2-AM at 37 °C for 20 min and then diluted 10-fold and incubated an additional 20 min. Cells were then washed and incubated with the indicated concentrations of mAb on ice for 20 min. After labeling, cells were washed once with RPMI medium and twice with calcium buffer (25 mm Hepes, 125 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm Na2HPO4, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmCaCl2, pH 7.4) and resuspended at 2.5 × 106 cells/ml in calcium buffer on ice. Fluorescence changes of a 2-ml stirred cell suspension warmed to 37 °C were monitored with a F-2000 or F-4500 spectrofluorimeter (Hitachi Instruments, Danbury, CT) using 340- and 380-nm excitation wavelengths and 510-nm emission wavelength following the addition of 10 μg/ml secondary antibody. Calcium concentrations were calculated as described by Grynkiewicz et al. (22Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Calcium flux from CD47 cross-linking was identical when cells were coated with 1 or 10 μg/ml anti-CD47 mAb, but no flux occurred when 0.1 μg/ml anti-CD47 was used or when the cross-linking antibody was omitted, confirming that CD47 aggregation was required for the rise in [Ca2+]i. The addition of 2 μm ionomycin served as a positive control for Ca2+ flux. The location of cell surface proteins in sucrose density gradients was evaluated using tracer125I-labeled antibodies as described (4Green J.M. Zhelesniak A. Chung J. Lindberg F.P. Sarfati M. Frazier W.A. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 673-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated with 5 μg/ml 125I-mAb in growth medium at 4 °C; washed; and lysed in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, 140 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 25 μg/ml aprotinin, 25 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% Brij 58. Sucrose solution was added to a final concentration of 40% using a stock of 60% sucrose in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, 140 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and this mixture was layered over a volume of 60% sucrose. 25 and 5% sucrose layers were added to form a step gradient, which was centrifuged at 170,000 × g for 18 h at 4 °C. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected from the top of the gradient, and radioactivity in each fraction as well as the pellet was assessed. Complexes were isolated as described (4Green J.M. Zhelesniak A. Chung J. Lindberg F.P. Sarfati M. Frazier W.A. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 673-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Briefly, OV10 cells expressing CD47 or mutants were mixed slowly in HBSS with anti-β3 integrin-coated magnetic beads for 15 min at 37 °C. Adherent cells were separated with a magnet and lysed in CHAPS buffer with mixing for 10 min. Beads were reisolated, bead-associated protein complexes were eluted with Laemmli sample buffer, and β3-associated CD47 was quantitated as described (4Green J.M. Zhelesniak A. Chung J. Lindberg F.P. Sarfati M. Frazier W.A. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 673-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Values are expressed in relative units based on densitometry of chemiluminscence-exposed bands on x-ray films. All experiments were repeated at least three times. Error bars in graphs depict S.E. The statistical significance of each set of results was evaluated by performing a one-way analysis of variance followed by Dunnett or individualt tests as appropriate. A p value of <0.05 was considered significant. Previous studies have indicated a requirement for both Ig and MMS domains of CD47 to mediate virtually all described functions of CD47 and for its efficient localization to membrane rafts. This suggests that an interaction between these domains may be important for function and subcellular localization. The Ig domain contains conserved cysteine residues at positions 41 and 114 that are necessary for the Ig domain formation as well as a potentially free Cys33 (Fig.1,A and C). Analysis of the structurally unusual MMS domain predicts a membrane topology with five membrane-spanning segments and residues Cys259 and Cys263 on the ectoplasmic face of the membrane (15Lindberg F.P. Gresham H.D. Schwarz E. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 485-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 A). We postulated that one of these cysteines could be involved in a disulfide bridge between the Ig and MMS domains potentially important for an Ig/MMS interaction. We isolated CD47 from human placenta (17Brown E.J. Hooper L. Ho T. Gresham H.D. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2785-2794Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) or JinB8 transfectants and performed chemical and enzymatic digests to evaluate disulfide linkage of the Ig and MMS domains. Attempts to determine the presence of a long range disulfide bond via classic methods of enzymatic digestion, high pressure liquid chromatography peptide separation, and mass spectrometry yielded only Ig domain peptides, as in previous studies using Edman degradation instead of mass spectrometry (17Brown E.J. Hooper L. Ho T. Gresham H.D. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2785-2794Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). It is likely that MMS domain peptides were lost during processing due to their hydrophobic character. Instead, digestion with either BNPS-skatole or endoproteinase Arg-C followed by Western blotting with a mAb that recognizes the COOH terminus of CD47 was used to identify the fragmentation pattern with or without reduction. BNPS-skatole, which cleaves carboxyl-terminal to tryptophan residues, could determine the presence or absence of the putative long range disulfide, because an ∼15-kDa carboxyl-terminal fragment resulting from cleavage after Trp157 in the first transmembrane segment would be present without reduction only in the absence of a disulfide between the Ig and MMS domains (Fig.2 A). As shown in Fig.2 B, the 15.5-kDa fragment was not observed on Western blotting of nonreduced samples of placental CD47 after treatment with BNPS-skatole but was easily detected in digested samples that had been reduced prior to separation on SDS-PAGE. The smaller 5-kDa band seen in reduced digested samples must represent cleavage by BNPS at another residue. Since secondary reaction sites for BNPS are Cys and Met, the most likely site for this secondary BNPS cleavage is Cys259(yielding a 4.9-kDa fragment). If Cys259 was involved in a disulfide bond with the Ig domain and the cleavage site was Cys263, BNPS cleavage would have released the C terminus even without sample reduction. The closest potential methionyl cleavage site (Met172) would have yielded a significantly larger fragment (14 kDa) and is therefore unlikely to account for this small fragment. Whatever the identity of the cleavage site, it is within 5 kDa of the C terminus yet is covalently linked to the amino terminus of the protein in the absence of reduction, demonstrating that a cysteine carboxyl-terminal to this cleavage site is involved in a disulfide bond. CD47 point mutants C33S, C259S, and C263S were transfected into the CD47-deficient Jurkat clone JinB8 (2Reinhold M.I. Green J.M. Lindberg F.P. Ticchioni M. Brown E.J. International Immunology. 1999; 11: 707-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) to identify the location of the cysteines involved in disulfide bonding. Unfortunately, it proved impossible"

Recent findings that TAFs may not be globally required for activator-dependent transcription in vivo andin vitro and that both TAF-dependent and TAF-independent promoters are found in yeast suggest that transcriptional activation can occur through at least two different pathways, depending on the presence or absence of TAFs. Using order-of-addition and template challenge assays performed in a human cell-free transcription system reconstituted with recombinant general transcription factors (TFIIB, TBP, TFIIE, TFIIF), a recombinant general cofactor (PC4), and highly purified epitope-tagged multiprotein complexes (TFIID, TFIIH, pol II), we demonstrate that when TBP is used as the TATA-binding factor transcriptional activators such as Gal4-VP16 and human papillomavirus E2 mainly function by facilitating pol II entry to the promoter region. In contrast, when TFIID is used as the TATA-binding factor, promoter recognition by TFIID appears to be the rate-limiting step facilitated by transcriptional activators during preinitiation complex assembly. Using protein-protein pull-down and far-Western analyses, we further show that the presence of TAFs in TFIID facilitates the recruitment of pol II by transcriptional activators, thereby switching the rate-limiting step from pol II entry to promoter recognition. Our findings thus provide distinct molecular mechanisms for TAF-independent and TAF-dependent activation.

The sequential assembly pathway typically begins with the binding of TFIID to the core promoter region, followed by the entry of TFIIB, RNA polymerase II (pol II)-TFIIF complex, TFIIE, and TFIIH (1Orphanides G. Lagrange T. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2657-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar, 2Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 327-335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). In this pathway, any steps of the PIC assembly are likely to be regulated by gene-specific transcription factors. Another pathway for PIC assembly usually takes place via recruitment of a preassembled TFIID-deficient pol II holoenzyme complex, which contains pol II, a subset of general transcription factors (GTFs), such as TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF, and TFIIH, as well as proteins involved in other cellular functions (3Myer V.E. Young R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27757-27760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In this two-component assembly pathway, either TFIID binding to the promoter region or pol II holoenzyme entry can be facilitated by transcriptional regulators (4Struhl K.

At present, many pol II holoenzyme complexes with distinct protein compositions have been isolated from both yeast and mammalian cells, reflecting a diverse function of pol II in regulating gene activity (3Myer V.E. Young R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27757-27760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar).To regulate the steps for PIC formation, gene-specific transcription factors often requires additional protein cofactors to efficiently communicate with the general transcription machinery. TFIID, being a multisubunit protein complex comprised of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and approximately a dozen TBP-associated factors (TAFs), clearly plays a critical role not only as a core promoter-binding factor (8Burke T.W. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3020-3031Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar,9Smale S.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1351: 73-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar), but also as a transducer in conveying the upstream regulatory signals to the downstream general transcription machinery (10Burley S.K.

These functional properties of TFIID are in part accounted for by the presence of TAFs, which further modulate the activity of TBP by providing enzymatic activities (13Dikstein R. Ruppert S. Tjian R.

Science. 1999; 286: 2151-2153Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). An important consequence of TAF association with TBP is to allow TFIID, but not TBP, to transcribe chromatin templates (20Näär A.M. Beaurang P.A. Robinson K.M. Oliner J.D. Avizonis D. Scheek S.

On the other hand, TAFs may mask the surfaces of TBP available for interaction with the TATA box and other protein regulators, thereby restricting the accessibility of the free form of TBP to the promoter region (22Burley S.K.

This hypothesis is further supported by recent findings that both TAF-dependent and TAF-independent promoters are found in yeast (32Li X.-Y. Bhaumik S.R. Green M.R. Science. 2000; 288: 1242-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 33Kuras L. Kosa P. Mencia M. Struhl K.

Stunnenberg H.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 527-537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Clearly, TFIID and TBP have distinct properties in supporting basal and activator-dependent transcription in eukaryotes.Using human cell-free transcription systems performed in HeLa nuclear extracts (29Oelgeschläger T. Yong T. Kang Y.K. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 925-931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) or in reconstituted transcription systems (6Wu S.-Y. Chiang C.-M. J. Biol.

A. 1999; 96: 1959-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), we and others demonstrated previously that both TAF-independent activation (i.e. using TBP as the TATA-binding factor) and TAF-dependent activation (i.e. using TFIID as the TATA-binding factor) could be recapitulated in vitrowith Gal4 fusion proteins containing different activation domains and also with other activators such as thyroid hormone receptor. To define the molecular mechanisms of TAF-independent and TAF-dependent activation, we further carry out order-of-addition and template challenge experiments in our highly purified in vitro transcription system. Intriguingly, we are able to show that in TAF-independent activation, pol II entry during PIC assembly is the major step regulated by transcriptional activators, whereas in TAF-dependent activation, promoter recognition by TFIID becomes the rate-limiting step enhanced by activators. Using GST pull-down and far-Western analyses, we also demonstrate that the reason why pol II entry is no longer the rate-limiting step when TFIID is used as the TATA-binding factor is because TAFs in TFIID can facilitate the recruitment of pol II by transcriptional activators, thereby switching the rate-limiting step from pol II entry to promoter recognition. These findings not only provide a molecular mechanism by which activation can occur in the absence of TAFs, but also document a novel function of TAFs in recruiting the initiation form of pol II.DISCUSSIONUsing a well defined in vitro transcription system reconstituted with only recombinant proteins (TFIIB, TBP, TFIIE, TFIIF, PC4) and epitope-tagged multiprotein complexes (TFIID, TFIIH, pol II), we demonstrated that TAF-independent activation could also be recapitulated with other activators such as HPV-11 E2 protein, similar to the observations noticed previously with thyroid hormone receptor (31Fondell J.D. Guermah M. Malik S. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1959-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and Gal4 fusion proteins with different activation domains (30Wu S.-Y. Kershnar E. Chiang C.-M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4478-4490Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The availability of this highly purified in vitrotranscription system provides us with a unique opportunity to further dissect the mechanisms of TAF-independent activation and TAF-dependent activation. We applied order-of-addition to divide the steps of PIC assembly, according to the sequential assembly pathway that was established more than a decade ago (59Buratowski S. Hahn S. Guarente L. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1989; 56: 549-561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). The template challenge also allows us to test the stability of promoter-bound protein complexes that do not “commit” transcription on specific templates.As template commitment is usually the rate-limiting step for PIC assembly (60Van Dyke M.W. Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 342-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and is likely to be regulated by various transcription factors and cofactors, it is not surprising to see that promoter recognition by TFIID is the rate-limiting step enhanced by transcriptional activators. Our result (Fig. 4) is consistent with previous reports that transcriptional activators or non-TAF coactivators may recognize TAFs to increase the recruitment or stability of TFIID binding to the core promoter (10Burley S.K. Roeder R.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 769-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar, 61Abmayr S.M. Workman J.L. Roeder R.G.

Lieberman P. Ellwood K. Carey M. Nature. 1995; 377: 254-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Unlike TFIID, TBP alone cannot commit transcription to specific templates. Template commitment with TBP only occurs when additional components of the general transcription machinery are also present to stabilize the promoter-TBP complex (Refs. 6Wu S.-Y. Chiang C.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12492-12498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar and 54Aso T. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26575-26583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and this study). Inclusion of a transcriptional activator and PC4 with TBP and DNA templates, in the absence of pol II and other GTFs, is not sufficient to commit TBP for transcription from prebound DNA templates (6Wu S.-Y. Chiang C.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12492-12498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The enhanced transcription by E2 and Gal4-VP16 in TAF-independent activation only occurs when pol II was included during the preincubation step (Fig. 2), indicating that these activators mainly work by facilitating pol II entry during PIC assembly in the absence of TAFs. This idea was further substantiated by the experiment demonstrating the loss of TAF-independent transcription when activators were added after pol II entry (Fig. 3). The possibility that the preincubation of pol II may result in an “activation” of pol II is less likely, as promoter recognition by TFIID and pol II entry represent two distinct activator-regulated steps in TAF-dependent and TAF-independent activation, respectively, are also observed in our cell-free transcription system performed with a preassembled TFIID-deficient pol II holoenzyme complex in conjunction with either TFIID or TBP (Ref. 6Wu S.-Y.

Clearly, TAF-independent activation mediated by TBP must take place via a mechanism distinct from TAF-dependent activation mediated by TFIID. Undoubtedly, promoter recognition by TFIID and pol II entry during PIC assembly are two major steps for PIC assembly (Fig.7), which can occur via either a sequential assembly pathway (TFIID/TBP, TFIIB, pol II/TFIIF, TFIIE, and TFIIH) or a two-component pathway (TFIID/TBP and pol II holoenzyme). This model also supports the view that recruitment of either TFIID or pol II holoenzyme is crucial in activating transcription in both yeast and mammalian cells (4Struhl K. Cell. 1996; 84: 179-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 5Nakajima T. Uchida C. Anderson S.F. Parvin J.D. Montminy M.

Obviously, a direct test of the model presented for having two distinct rate-limiting steps that shift depending upon having TBP or TFIID is to perform a kinetic analysis that would test association/dissociation rates of TBP and TFIID to the DNA sequence in the presence and absence of the activators and other components of the general transcription machinery, which will further shed light on the mechanisms of TAF-independent and TAF-dependent activation.Our findings presented here not only provide a molecular mechanism by which activation can occur in the absence of TAFs, but also document a novel role of TAF function. That is, TAFs can facilitate the recruitment of pol II by transcriptional activators, thereby accounting for the functional difference between TAF-independent and TAF-dependent activation pathways. Our data are also consistent with an earlier observation that TAFs may promote a step of PIC assembly post TFIIB entry by transcriptional activators (66Choy B. Green M.R. Nature. 1993; 366: 531-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). As TAF-independent activation can occur both in vivo andin vitro, this study thus provides a molecular basis for TAF-independent activation, which represents a new paradigm of eukaryotic gene regulation. In eukaryotes, transcription preinitiation complex (PIC)1 formation can occur via at least two different pathways. The sequential assembly pathway typically begins with the binding of TFIID to the core promoter region, followed by the entry of TFIIB, RNA polymerase II (pol II)-TFIIF complex, TFIIE, and TFIIH (1Orphanides G. Lagrange T. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2657-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar, 2Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 327-335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). In this pathway, any steps of the PIC assembly are likely to be regulated by gene-specific transcription factors. Another pathway for PIC assembly usually takes place via recruitment of a preassembled TFIID-deficient pol II holoenzyme complex, which contains pol II, a subset of general transcription factors (GTFs), such as TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF, and TFIIH, as well as proteins involved in other cellular functions (3Myer V.E. Young R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27757-27760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In this two-component assembly pathway, either TFIID binding to the promoter region or pol II holoenzyme entry can be facilitated by transcriptional regulators (4Struhl K. Cell. 1996; 84: 179-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 5Nakajima T. Uchida C. Anderson S.F. Parvin J.D. Montminy M.

At present, many pol II holoenzyme complexes with distinct protein compositions have been isolated from both yeast and mammalian cells, reflecting a diverse function of pol II in regulating gene activity (3Myer V.E. Young R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27757-27760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). To regulate the steps for PIC formation, gene-specific transcription factors often requires additional protein cofactors to efficiently communicate with the general transcription machinery. TFIID, being a multisubunit protein complex comprised of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and approximately a dozen TBP-associated factors (TAFs), clearly plays a critical role not only as a core promoter-binding factor (8Burke T.W. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3020-3031Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar,9Smale S.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1351: 73-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar), but also as a transducer in conveying the upstream regulatory signals to the downstream general transcription machinery (10Burley S.K. Roeder R.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 769-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar, 11Albright S.R. Tjian R. Gene. 2000; 242: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 12Green M.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 59-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). These functional properties of TFIID are in part accounted for by the presence of TAFs, which further modulate the activity of TBP by providing enzymatic activities (13Dikstein R. Ruppert S. Tjian R.

Science. 1999; 286: 2151-2153Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). An important consequence of TAF association with TBP is to allow TFIID, but not TBP, to transcribe chromatin templates (20Näär A.M. Beaurang P.A. Robinson K.M. Oliner J.D. Avizonis D. Scheek S.

On the other hand, TAFs may mask the surfaces of TBP available for interaction with the TATA box and other protein regulators, thereby restricting the accessibility of the free form of TBP to the promoter region (22Burley S.K. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1998; 94: 551-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 23Liu D. Ishima R. Tong K.I. Bagby S. Kokubo T. Muhandiram D.R. Kay L.E. Nakatani Y. Ikura M.

A. 1999; 96: 1959-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) suggests that transcriptional activation can occur through at least two different pathways, depending on the presence or absence of TAFs. This hypothesis is further supported by recent findings that both TAF-dependent and TAF-independent promoters are found in yeast (32Li X.-Y. Bhaumik S.R. Green M.R. Science. 2000; 288: 1242-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 33Kuras L. Kosa P. Mencia M. Struhl K. Science. 2000; 288: 1244-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and that a TBP-sans-TAFs complex containing TBP and unprocessed TFIIAαβ precursor is found in undifferentiated mouse embryonic carcinoma cells (34Mitsiou D.J. Stunnenberg H.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 527-537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Clearly, TFIID and TBP have distinct properties in supporting basal and activator-dependent transcription in eukaryotes. Using human cell-free transcription systems performed in HeLa nuclear extracts (29Oelgeschläger T. Yong T. Kang Y.K. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 925-931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) or in reconstituted transcription systems (6Wu S.-Y. Chiang C.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12492-12498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 30Wu S.-Y. Kershnar E. Chiang C.-M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4478-4490Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 31Fondell J.D. Guermah M. Malik S. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1959-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), we and others demonstrated previously that both TAF-independent activation (i.e. using TBP as the TATA-binding factor) and TAF-dependent activation (i.e. using TFIID as the TATA-binding factor) could be recapitulated in vitrowith Gal4 fusion proteins containing different activation domains and also with other activators such as thyroid hormone receptor. To define the molecular mechanisms of TAF-independent and TAF-dependent activation, we further carry out order-of-addition and template challenge experiments in our highly purified in vitro transcription system. Intriguingly, we are able to show that in TAF-independent activation, pol II entry during PIC assembly is the major step regulated by transcriptional activators, whereas in TAF-dependent activation, promoter recognition by TFIID becomes the rate-limiting step enhanced by activators. Using GST pull-down and far-Western analyses, we also demonstrate that the reason why pol II entry is no longer the rate-limiting step when TFIID is used as the TATA-binding factor is because TAFs in TFIID can facilitate the recruitment of pol II by transcriptional activators, thereby switching the rate-limiting step from pol II entry to promoter recognition. These findings not only provide a molecular mechanism by which activation can occur in the absence of TAFs, but also document a novel function of TAFs in recruiting the initiation form of pol II. DISCUSSIONUsing a well defined in vitro transcription system reconstituted with only recombinant proteins (TFIIB, TBP, TFIIE, TFIIF, PC4) and epitope-tagged multiprotein complexes (TFIID, TFIIH, pol II), we demonstrated that TAF-independent activation could also be recapitulated with other activators such as HPV-11 E2 protein, similar to the observations noticed previously with thyroid hormone receptor (31Fondell J.D. Guermah M. Malik S. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1959-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and Gal4 fusion proteins with different activation domains (30Wu S.-Y. Kershnar E. Chiang C.-M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4478-4490Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The availability of this highly purified in vitrotranscription system provides us with a unique opportunity to further dissect the mechanisms of TAF-independent activation and TAF-dependent activation. We applied order-of-addition to divide the steps of PIC assembly, according to the sequential assembly pathway that was established more than a decade ago (59Buratowski S. Hahn S. Guarente L. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1989; 56: 549-561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). The template challenge also allows us to test the stability of promoter-bound protein complexes that do not “commit” transcription on specific templates.As template commitment is usually the rate-limiting step for PIC assembly (60Van Dyke M.W. Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 342-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and is likely to be regulated by various transcription factors and cofactors, it is not surprising to see that promoter recognition by TFIID is the rate-limiting step enhanced by transcriptional activators. Our result (Fig. 4) is consistent with previous reports that transcriptional activators or non-TAF coactivators may recognize TAFs to increase the recruitment or stability of TFIID binding to the core promoter (10Burley S.K. Roeder R.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 769-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar, 61Abmayr S.M. Workman J.L. Roeder R.G.

Lieberman P. Ellwood K. Carey M. Nature. 1995; 377: 254-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Unlike TFIID, TBP alone cannot commit transcription to specific templates. Template commitment with TBP only occurs when additional components of the general transcription machinery are also present to stabilize the promoter-TBP complex (Refs. 6Wu S.-Y. Chiang C.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12492-12498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar and 54Aso T. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26575-26583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and this study). Inclusion of a transcriptional activator and PC4 with TBP and DNA templates, in the absence of pol II and other GTFs, is not sufficient to commit TBP for transcription from prebound DNA templates (6Wu S.-Y. Chiang C.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12492-12498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The enhanced transcription by E2 and Gal4-VP16 in TAF-independent activation only occurs when pol II was included during the preincubation step (Fig. 2), indicating that these activators mainly work by facilitating pol II entry during PIC assembly in the absence of TAFs. This idea was further substantiated by the experiment demonstrating the loss of TAF-independent transcription when activators were added after pol II entry (Fig. 3). The possibility that the preincubation of pol II may result in an “activation” of pol II is less likely, as promoter recognition by TFIID and pol II entry represent two distinct activator-regulated steps in TAF-dependent and TAF-independent activation, respectively, are also observed in our cell-free transcription system performed with a preassembled TFIID-deficient pol II holoenzyme complex in conjunction with either TFIID or TBP (Ref. 6Wu S.-Y.

https://openalex.org/W1973954889,"A signaling cascade that includes protein kinase C (PKC), Ras, and MEKK1 regulates involucrin (hINV) gene expression in epidermal keratinocytes (Efimova, T., LaCelle, P., Welter, J. F., and Eckert, R. L. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 24387–24395 and Efimova, T., and Eckert, R. L. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 1601–1607). Because signal transfer downstream of MEKK1 may involve several MAPK kinases (MEKs), it is important to evaluate the regulatory role of each MEK isoform. In the present study we evaluate the role of MEK6 in transmitting this signal. Constitutively active MEK6 (caMEK6) increases hINV promoter activity and increases endogenous hINV levels. The caMEK6-dependent increase in gene expression is inhibited by the p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB203580, and is associated with a marked increase in p38α MAPK activity; JNK and ERK kinases are not activated. In addition, hINV gene expression is inhibited by dominant-negative p38α and increased when caMEK6 and p38α are co-expressed. caMEK6 also activates p38δ, but p38δ inhibits the caMEK6-dependent activation. These results suggest that MEK6 increases hINV gene expression by regulating the balance between activation of p38α, which increases gene expression, and p38δ, which decreases gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2023292189,"Binding of proteins to the plasma membrane can be achieved with various membrane targeting motifs, including combinations of fatty acids, isoprenoids, and basic domains. In this study, we investigate whether attachment of different membrane targeting motifs influences the signaling capacity of membrane-bound signal transduction proteins by directing the proteins to different membrane microdomains. We used c-Raf-1 as a model for a signaling protein that is activated when membrane-bound. Three different membrane targeting motifs from K-Ras, Fyn, and Src proteins were fused to the N or C terminus of Raf-1. The ability of the modified Rafs to initiate MAPK signaling was then investigated. All three modified Raf-1 constructs activated MAPK to nearly equivalent levels. The extent of localization of the Raf-1 constructs to membrane microdomains known as rafts did not correlate with the level of MAPK activation. Moreover, treatment of cells with the raft disrupting drug methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) caused activation of MAPK to levels equivalent to those achieved with membrane-targeted Raf constructs. The use of pharmacological agents as well as dominant negative mutants revealed that MAPK activation by MβCD proceeds via a phosphoinositide 3-kinase-dependent mechanism that is Ras/Raf-independent. We conclude that cholesterol depletion from the plasma membrane by MβCD constitutes an alternative pathway for activating MAPK.

Binding of proteins to the inner face of the plasma membrane can be achieved with various membrane targeting motifs, including combinations of fatty acids, isoprenoids, and polybasic domains. For example, Src uses myristate with a polybasic stretch of amino acids at the N terminus to achieve membrane binding, whereas Fyn, a Src family member, uses a myristate + palmitate motif (4Alland L.

A C-terminal farnesyl group in conjunction with a polybasic stretch (K-Ras) or palmitates (Ha-Ras) are required to promote membrane binding of Ras proteins (6Hancock J.F. Cadwallader K. Paterson H.

Biol. 1994; 14: 4722-4730Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). It is not clear why such a variety of targeting motifs exist and whether each individual motif promotes a unique function. Rafts are specialized plasma membrane microdomains that are highly enriched in cholesterol, glycosphingolipids, and glycophosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins (8Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar, 9Brown D.A. London E. J. Biol.

Membrane rafts are relatively resistant to extraction with non-ionic detergents and exhibit a low buoyant density. Recent studies have shown that fatty acylation of proteins, such as Src family kinases and Gα subunits, promotes targeting to these membrane microdomains (12Robbins S.M. Quintrell N.A. Bishop J.M.

Moreover, targeting of proteins to rafts is often required for the initiation of signal transduction. For example, fatty acylation and localization of Lck, Fyn, and LAT (linker for activation of T cells) to rafts are essential for their function in T cell receptor-mediated signal transduction (15van't Hof W.

Activated Ras recruits cytosolic Raf to the inner surface of the plasma membrane where Raf is activated. It has been shown previously that Raf modified with the K-Ras membrane targeting motif is permanently targeted to the plasma membrane and is constitutively activated (21Leevers S.J. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar, 22Stokoe D. Macdonald S.G. Cadwallader K. Symons M. Hancock J.F. Science. 1994; 264: 1463-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). Here we used c-Raf-1 as a model to determine whether the attachment of different membrane-targeting motifs influences the signaling capacity of membrane-bound signaling molecules by directing the proteins to different membrane microdomains. The membrane-targeting motifs from Src, Fyn, and K-Ras were attached to c-Raf-1, and the ability of the modified Raf proteins to initiate MAPK signaling was investigated. All three modified Raf-1 constructs were targeted to the plasma membrane and activated MAPK to similar levels. However, the extent of raft localization did not correlate with the level of MAPK activation by each of the Raf constructs. Furthermore, we demonstrated that depletion of plasma membrane cholesterol by the raft disrupting drug methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) induced MAPK activation via a PI3K-dependent mechanism. These results suggest that the activity of key signaling proteins is regulated by plasma membrane cholesterol levels. Rabbit polyclonal anti-ERK2 (c-14), anti-caveolin-1 (N-20), and anti-Raf-1 (c-12) as well as monoclonal antic-Myc (9E10), anti-p-ERK (E-4), anti-phosphotyrosine (PY20), and anti-Ha-Ras were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Monoclonal anti-pan-Ras was from Calbiochem. Monoclonal anti-Raf-1 was purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Rabbit polyclonal anti-MAPK was purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). The polyclonal PI3K antibody was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse and rabbit secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Optiprep was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Wortmannin, cholesterol, filipin, and methyl-β-cyclodextrin were purchased from Sigma. LY294002 was purchased from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). PD98059 was purchased from Calbiochem. Myc-Raf was constructed as follows. A sense primer was designed containing aSacI site, start codon, 10-amino acid Myc tag, and the N-terminal 6 amino acids of c-Raf. An antisense primer that began 661 bases from start codon of c-raf including a uniqueHindIII site was constructed. The polymerase chain reaction product generated from these two primers was digested withSacI and HindIII and used to replace the corresponding region of raf in pGEM-7Zf(+). For the Myc-Raf-K-Ras construct, an antisense primer was generated that encoded the 6 C-terminal amino acids of c-Raf-1, followed by the C-terminal 18 amino acids of K-Ras, a stop codon, and an XbaI site and three extra bases. A sense primer was constructed that included a unique EcoRV site upstream from the 3′ end of c-raf-1. The polymerase chain reaction product was digested with EcoRV/XbaI and subcloned into Myc-Raf-pGEM-7Zf(+) digested with the same enzymes. The construction of Raf-Myc was based on the same methods as those described for Myc-Raf-K-Ras, except the antisense primer contained codons for the 10-amino acid Myc tag. Fusion of the 16 N-terminal Fyn or 20 N-terminal Src amino acids onto the N terminus of c-Raf-1 was accomplished by the methods described for the Myc-Raf construction, except the sense primer encoded Fyn or Src amino acids. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing prior to subcloning into the pCMV5 vector. Ha-RasN17 was a gift from Dr. Neal Rosen (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York). The Δp85 and p110-CAAXconstructs were gifts from Dr. Kurt Ballmer-Hofer (Paul Scherrer Institute, Switzerland). COS-1 cells were maintained as described previously (4Alland L. Peseckis S.M. Atherton R.E. Berthiaume L. Resh M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16701-16705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). COS-1 cells were transfected with FuGene 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or LipofectAMINE 2000 (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were processed at 48–72 h after transfection. Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Lysates were clarified at 14,000 rpm in the Eppendorf centrifuge for 15 min at 4 °C. For immunoprecipitation, lysates were incubated with appropriate antibodies and protein A-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or formalin-fixed Staphylococcus aureus. Samples were washed three times with RIPA buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Western blotting was performed using the indicated antibodies. Proteins were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) following the manufacturer's instructions. For quantitation of Western blots, x-ray films were scanned with an Epson Expression 636 scanner (Epson, Long Beach, CA), and the intensities of the bands were quantified using MacBAS software version 2.0 (Fuji Photo Film Co.; Kohshin Graphic Systems Inc.). Exposure times were adjusted so that the band intensity fell within the linear range of detection. COS-1 cells were incubated in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 24 h before the indicated treatments. Cell lysates were prepared as described above. Activation of MAPK was measured by immunoblotting with anti-p-ERK antibody. For cholesterol depletion experiments, cells were incubated with 1% MβCD (dissolved in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) for 1 h at 37 °C before lysis. In other experiments, cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with the indicated inhibitors prior to harvest. Subcellular fractionation was carried out as described previously (4Alland L. Peseckis S.M. Atherton R.E. Berthiaume L. Resh M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16701-16705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, transfected COS-1 cells were lysed by Dounce homogenization in hypotonic buffer. The lysates were subjected to ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g to generate S100 (soluble) and P100 (membrane) fractions. Each fraction was adjusted to 1× RIPA buffer and immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody followed by Western blotting with anti-Raf antibody. Immunofluorescence staining was carried out as described previously (23Okamura H. Resh M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26613-26618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). COS-1 cells transfected with Raf-1 constructs were seeded onto 25-mm glass coverslips 24 h after transfection. 24 h later, the cells were washed twice with PBS, fixed with 3.7% formalin/PBS for 15 min, and incubated with indicated antibody for 45 min. Cells were washed four times with PBS and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody for 30 min. Following four 5-min washes, cells were mounted on microscope slides and visualized with a Zeiss Axioplan2 microscope. Membrane raft flotation experiments were performed as described (24Manes S. Mira E. Gomez-Mouton C. Lacalle R.A. Keller P. Labrador J.P. Martinez A.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6211-6220Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, cells were washed twice with ice-cold 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA (STE) and harvested in STE with a rubber policeman. Cell pellets were obtained by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The cell pellet was resuspended in 300 μl of TNET buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100) containing protease inhibitors (1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin), incubated on ice for 20 min, and then adjusted to 35% Optiprep. Cell extracts were overlaid successively with 3.5 ml of 30% Optiprep in TNET and 200 μl of TNET, respectively, in SW55 tubes. Samples were centrifuged for 4 h at 170,000 × gat 4 °C, and five fractions were collected from the top of the gradient. Each fraction was adjusted to 1× RIPA buffer and clarified at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min. Proteins from each fraction were analyzed by either immunoprecipitation followed by SDS-PAGE or by direct SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. To test whether individual membrane-binding motifs have unique functions in signal transduction, we constructed forms of Raf that were modified by the addition of three different membrane-binding motifs (Fig.1 A). The prenylated tail from K-Ras was appended to the C terminus of Raf, whereas the myristate + basic and myristate + palmitate sequences from Src and Fyn, respectively, were appended to the N terminus of Raf. A Myc epitope tag was added to each construct in order to distinguish the recombinant Raf molecules from endogenous Raf-1. Subcellular fractionation was performed to examine whether Raf constructs tagged with the different membrane-binding motifs were targeted to membranes, by separating transfected COS-1 cells into cytosolic (S100) and membrane (P100) fractions. As depicted in Fig. 1, A and B, Raf molecules containing the various membrane-binding motifs were localized predominantly to the membrane fraction. In contrast, Raf-Myc and Myc-Raf were mainly present in the cytosolic fraction. This demonstrates that the appended membrane binding signals were functional in the context of Raf chimeras. In order to examine whether the Raf constructs tagged with the various membrane-binding motifs can target to the plasma membrane, COS-1 cells transfected with the Raf constructs were subjected to immunofluorescence staining with either anti-Raf or anti-Myc antibodies. The Raf-Myc and Myc-Raf proteins were mainly cytoplasmic, whereas the three Raf constructs tagged with the different membrane-targeting motifs exhibited a typical plasma membrane staining pattern (Fig. 2). Previous studies (21Leevers S.J. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar, 22Stokoe D. Macdonald S.G. Cadwallader K. Symons M. Hancock J.F. Science. 1994; 264: 1463-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar) have shown that Raf modified with the K-Ras membrane-binding motif can activate ERK independent of Ras. Here, we compared the biological effects of the three tagged Raf constructs on ERK. Activation of ERK was quantitated by Western blotting with anti-p-ERK antibody (which recognizes only activated ERK) and normalized to the total amount of ERK and Raf construct in each set of transfected cells. The three Raf constructs modified with different membrane-binding domains all caused a more than 10-fold increase in ERK activity, as shown in Fig. 3. Both Myc-Raf and Raf-Myc caused only a slight increase in ERK activity above the background level. These data demonstrate that plasma membrane targeting of Raf is sufficient to activate ERK, consistent with the current model that activation of Raf is due to the recruitment to the plasma membrane by activated Ras (21Leevers S.J. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar, 22Stokoe D. Macdonald S.G. Cadwallader K. Symons M. Hancock J.F. Science. 1994; 264: 1463-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). We next examined the localization of the various modified Raf constructs to rafts. Optiprep density gradient centrifugation was used to separate raft-associated proteins from detergent-sensitive proteins. COS-1 cells transfected with the various Raf constructs were harvested and extracted in ice-cold buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100. After flotation on Optiprep gradients, five fractions were collected from top to bottom. Rafts are located in the top fraction at the 0/30% interface. The distribution of Raf constructs is shown in Fig.4, A and B. Approximately 60–65% of Fyn-Raf-Myc and Src-Raf-Myc were raft associated. In contrast, only 18% of Myc-Raf-K-Ras partitioned into raft fractions. This pattern is consistent with previous studies indicating that proteins with covalently linked saturated fatty acyl chains are preferentially targeted to rafts, whereas proteins with prenyl groups are excluded (26Melkonian K.A. Ostermeyer A.G. Chen J.Z. Roth M.G. Brown D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3910-3917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). The Raf-Myc and Myc-Raf constructs served as negative controls; these unmodified proteins were found to be excluded completely from rafts. Caveolin-1, an endogenous protein marker for lipid rafts and caveolae, was used as a positive control. As expected, the majority of caveolin-1 was targeted into rafts. The localization of Ha-RasG12V and K-RasG12V, which play an important role in Ras-Raf-MAPK signal transduction pathway, was also analyzed. As depicted in Fig. 4 C, both Ras proteins were almost completely excluded from rafts, consistent with previous studies (26Melkonian K.A. Ostermeyer A.G. Chen J.Z. Roth M.G. Brown D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3910-3917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Moreover, neither ERK nor p-ERK partitioned into raft fractions. Taken together, these results indicate that the extent of raft localization of the Raf constructs did not directly correlate with the level of ERK activation shown in Fig. 3. We next used the raft disrupting drug MβCD to examine further a potential role of rafts in activation of ERK. COS-1 cells transfected with the various Raf constructs were treated with MβCD for 1 h at 37 °C. Cell lysates were analyzed for activation of ERK by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-p-ERK antibody. As depicted in Fig.5 A, MβCD had a striking effect on ERK activity, causing a nearly 10-fold increase in p-ERK in mock-transfected, Myc-Raf and Raf-Myc-transfected cells. A similar result was obtained in NIH 3T3 cells, where addition of MβCD caused a 10-fold activation of ERK (Fig. 5 B). In cells expressing the membrane-targeted Raf proteins, there was little to no additional activation of ERK in the presence of MβCD (TableI). Levels of total ERK were the same in all samples.Table IEffect of MβCD on ERK activity mediated by modified Raf constructsConstructsERK activity−MβCD+MβCDS.D.Myc-Raf-K-Ras11.38±0.10Fyn-Raf-Myc11.22±0.04Src-Raf-Myc11.20±0.25COS-1 cells transfected with the indicated Raf constructs were incubated with or without 1% MβCD for 1 h at 37 °C. Activation of ERK was assayed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” ERK activation for each Raf-1 constructs in the absence of MβCD was normalized to 1. S.D., standard deviation. Open table in a new tab COS-1 cells transfected with the indicated Raf constructs were incubated with or without 1% MβCD for 1 h at 37 °C. Activation of ERK was assayed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” ERK activation for each Raf-1 constructs in the absence of MβCD was normalized to 1. S.D., standard deviation. In order to determine whether the effects of MβCD were related to the ability of this compound to bind cholesterol, COS-1 cells were incubated with MβCD in the presence or absence 40 μg/ml cholesterol. As depicted in Fig. 5 C, cholesterol addition prevented ERK activation by MβCD, with the amount of p-ERK reduced to near basal levels. Moreover, addition of another cholesterol-binding agent, filipin, also caused a 4–5-fold activation of ERK (Fig.5 D). These data imply that cholesterol depletion from cell membrane induces ERK activation. The next set of experiments addressed the mechanism by which ERK is activated by MβCD. A dominant negative Ras (Ha-RasN17) construct was used to examine whether activation of ERK by MβCD is dependent on Ras. As depicted in Fig. 6, Ha-RasN17 had no effect on activation of ERK induced by MβCD. In contrast, Ha-RasN17 almost completely inhibited activation of ERK mediated by constitutively activated Ha-Ras (Ha-RasG12V). These results indicate that MβCD-mediated ERK activation occurs through a Ras-independent pathway. Previous studies have indicated a critical role for PI3K in activation of Ras and ERK by epidermal growth factor (27Wennstrom S. Downward J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4279-4288Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 28Yart A. Laffargue M. Mayeux P. Chretien S. Peres C. Tonks N. Roche S. Payrastre B. Chap H. Raynal P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8856-8864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Here, we investigated whether MβCD-induced activation of ERK requires PI3K activity. COS-1 cells were incubated with or without the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin during MβCD treatment. Phosphorylation of endogenous ERK was visualized using anti-p-ERK immunoblotting. Pretreatment with wortmannin almost completely abolished the activation of ERK induced by MβCD, as shown in Fig.7 A. However, wortmannin had no effect on activation of ERK induced by Myc-Raf-K-Ras. The role of PI3K in MβCD-stimulated ERK activation was further confirmed by utilizing LY294002, another inhibitor of PI3K, which is structurally and mechanistically different from wortmannin. As shown in Fig.7 B, treatment of cells with LY294002 inhibited MβCD-induced activation of ERK in a dose-dependent manner. To confirm the data obtained with pharmacological inhibitors, we examined the ability of Δp85, a dominant negative PI3K mutant lacking the p110-binding site, to inhibit MβCD-mediated ERK activation. The activation of ERK was ∼50% (±10%,n = 4) lower when Δp85 was expressed, compared with mock-transfected cells (Fig. 7 C). This level of inhibition correlates with a transfection efficiency of 43% (±6%,n = 6) obtained in these experiments. Finally, activation of PI3K by MβCD was assessed directly, by quantitating the extent of tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous p85. Phosphorylation of p85 has been shown to correlate with increased PI3K activity (43Pleiman C.M. Hertz W.M. Cambier J.C. Science. 1994; 263: 1609-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). As depicted in Fig. 7 D, MβCD caused a 3-fold increase in the amount of tyrosine-phosphorylated p85. Taken together, these results indicate that PI3K is required for activation of ERK mediated by MβCD. We next investigated the role of MEK in MβCD-mediated ERK activation. COS-1 cells were incubated with or without 20 μm PD98059 (a specific MEK inhibitor) for 1 h at 37 °C during MβCD treatment. Subsequently, the cells were lysed, and activation of ERK was analyzed by using anti-p-ERK antibody immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 8, the activation of ERK by MβCD was inhibited by about 50% in the presence of PD98059. In contrast, activation of ERK by Ha-RasG12V and Myc-Raf-K-Ras was nearly completely inhibited by PD98059. All samples contained approximately equal amounts of total ERK. Thus, although MEK is essential for both Ha-RasG12V- and Myc-Raf-K-Ras-mediated ERK activation, activation of ERK by MβCD is only partially dependent on MEK activity. In this paper, we have examined the role of membrane microdomains in activation of MAPK by plasma membrane-bound Raf. There is growing evidence in the literature to indicate that concentration of signaling proteins in membrane microdomains such as rafts and/or caveolae is essential for efficient signal transduction. For example, localization of Src family kinases and LAT to cholesterol, sphingolipid-enriched rafts is required for activation of downstream signaling via the activated T cell receptor (15van't Hof W. Resh M.D. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 377-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 16Kabouridis P.S. Magee A.I. Ley S.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4983-4998Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 17Zhang W. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 1998; 9: 239-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). Other reports have suggested that localization of receptor tyrosine kinases to caveolae is important for stimulation of the MAPK pathway (18Mineo C. James G.L. Smart E.J. Anderson R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11930-11935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 19Liu P. Ying Y. Ko Y.G. Anderson R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10299-10303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). c-Raf-1, a key intermediate in this pathway, has been reported to be recruited to caveolae upon activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor or Ha-RasG12V (18Mineo C. James G.L. Smart E.J. Anderson R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11930-11935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested the role of membrane microdomains by quantitating the ability of three different membrane-targeted Raf-1 constructs to activate MAPK. The amount of p-ERK was normalized to the total amount of each Raf-1 construct and to the total amount of ERK in each set of transfected cells. We found that the extent of MAPK activation by the Src-, Fyn-, and K-Ras-modified Raf proteins was essentially equivalent. It should be noted that expression of an Ha-Ras-tagged Raf construct resulted in 2–3-fold less p-ERK than the other tagged constructs (data not shown). However, indirect immunofluorescence analysis revealed that, in addition to the plasma membrane, a significant amount of Myc-Raf-Ha-Ras was localized to intracellular perinuclear membranes. Perinuclear staining of full-length Ha-Ras, as well as other Ha-Ras-tagged chimeras, has been observed previously and reflects the trafficking of these proteins through the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi (25Choy E. Chiu V.K. Silletti J. Feoktistov M. Morimoto T. Michaelson D. Ivanov I.E. Philips M.R. Cell. 1999; 98: 69-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Thus, the lower level of p-ERK in these cells may be due to the fact that there is less Myc-Raf-Ha-Ras at the plasma membrane, compared with the other tagged constructs. The extent of MAPK activation did not correlate with the extent of raft localization of the Raf chimeras. As depicted in Fig. 4, the Src and Fyn motifs efficiently targeted the chimeric Raf proteins to rafts, whereas Raf tagged with the prenylated tail from K-Ras was excluded from rafts. The behavior of the chimeric proteins described here mimics that of the full-length proteins; Src and Fyn are enriched in rafts (14Shenoy-Scaria A.M. Dietzen D.J. Kwong J. Link D.C. Lublin D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 353-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 19Liu P. Ying Y. Ko Y.G. Anderson R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10299-10303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), whereas Ras proteins are largely excluded from rafts (see below) (26Melkonian K.A. Ostermeyer A.G. Chen J.Z. Roth M.G. Brown D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3910-3917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). The raft fractions that were isolated are heterogeneous and include detergent-resistant membranes as well as caveolae. We conclude that, once Raf is membrane-bound, the activation of ERK is raft-independent. The physiological upstream activator of Raf is Ras, which serves to recruit Raf to the plasma membrane. There is now increasing evidence in the literature to indicate that Ras isoforms differ in their abilities to activate downstream effectors. For example, K-Ras activates Raf-1 to a much greater extent than Ha-Ras, whereas Ha-Ras activation of PI3K is greater than that achieved by K-Ras (29Yan J. Roy S. Apolloni A. Lane A. Hancock J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24052-24056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Moreover, Ha-Ras and K-Ras are localized to different regions of the plasma membrane. K-Ras is distributed throughout the bulk plasma membrane, and activation of Raf by K-Ras is independent of membrane microdomain structure or function. In contrast, the inactive form of Ha-Ras is localized to rafts. Upon binding of GTP, Ha-Ras is released from rafts, a step that is required for full activation of Raf (30Roy S. Luetterforst R. Harding A. Apolloni A. Etheridge M. Stang E. Rolls B. Hancock J.F. Parton R.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 98-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 31Prior I.A. Harding A. Yan J. Sluimer J. Parton R.G. Hancock J.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 368-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data indicate that Ras-dependent activation of Raf occurs less efficiently in rafts, but once Raf is constitutively membrane-bound, its activation is raft-independent. MβCD is a water-soluble cyclic oligomer that sequesters cholesterol within its hydrophobic core (32Pitha J. Irie T. Sklar P.B. Nye J.S. Life Sci. 1988; 43: 493-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). It has been extensively used as an agent to deplete cholesterol from the plasma membrane of cultured cells (33Neufeld E.B. Cooney A.M. Pitha J. Dawidowicz E.A. Dwyer N.K. Pentchev P.G. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21604-21613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Here we show that MβCD treatment of COS-1 cells results in a dramatic stimulation of MAPK, as reflected in a nearly 10-fold increase in the amount of p-ERK. Stimulation of MAPK by MβCD had been noted previously(20), but the mechanism of activation had not been addressed. In this work, we utilized a combination of pharmacological inhibitors and dominant negative mutants to examine the mechanism of MAPK activation by MβCD. We show that the MβCD effect on MAPK is Ras-independent, as expression of dominant negative Ras had no effect on p-ERK formation in the presence of MβCD (Fig. 6). The MβCD effect occurred downstream or independently from Raf. No additive effect was observed when cells expressing membrane-targeted Raf constructs were treated with MβCD (Table I), and MβCD has no direct effect on Raf activity (30Roy S. Luetterforst R. Harding A. Apolloni A. Etheridge M. Stang E. Rolls B. Hancock J.F. Parton R.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 98-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence support the hypothesis that MβCD activates MAPK via a PI3K-dependent pathway. Treatment of cells with the PI3K inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002 inhibited MβCD-induced activation of MAPK (Fig. 7). Moreover, MAPK activation by MβCD was inhibited when cells were transfected with a dominant negative PI3K mutant, and a 3-fold increase in tyrosine-phosphorylated p85 was observed in MβCD-treated cells. Previous studies have established a close correlation between p85 phosphorylation and PI3K activity (43Pleiman C.M. Hertz W.M. Cambier J.C. Science. 1994; 263: 1609-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Activation of PI3K, however, was not sufficient to activate MAPK, as no effect of p110-CAAX, a constitutively activated mutant of PI3K, was observed on p-ERK formation (data not shown). Moreover, MEK was partially required, as concentrations of the MEK-specific inhibitor PD98059 that completely blocked RasG12V activation of MAPK had only partial (50%) inhibitory effects on MβCD activation of MAPK (Fig. 8). At least four mechanisms for activation of MAPK by PI3K-dependent pathways have been reported. Generation of inositol phospholipids by activated PI3K has been shown to stimulate protein kinase C, which then stimulates Raf and activates MAPK (34Le Good J.A. Ziegler W.H. Parekh D.B. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Parker P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 2042-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar,35Li X. Carter R.H. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 1576-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). PI3K has been shown to activate Rac, which activates MEK via stimulation of p21-activated kinase and Raf (36King A.J. Sun H. Diaz B. Barnard D. Miao W. Bagrodia S. Marshall M.S. Nature. 1998; 396: 180-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Recently, Yartet al. (28Yart A. Laffargue M. Mayeux P. Chretien S. Peres C. Tonks N. Roche S. Payrastre B. Chap H. Raynal P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8856-8864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) reported that MAPK activation in epidermal growth factor-stimulated Vero cells was PI3K-dependent; the mechanism involved recruitment of SHP2 and the adaptor protein Gab, upstream of Ras. Finally, G protein-coupled receptors, through Gβγ, have been shown to recruit PI3K to the membrane. This results in activation of Src and the use of an SHC-Grb2-SOS complex to activate Ras and ultimately MAPK (37Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1839-1842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar, 38Lopez-Ilasaca M. Crespo P. Pellici P.G. Gutkind J.S. Wetzker R. Science. 1997; 275: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Since MβCD activation of MAPK is independent of Ras (Fig. 6), Raf (30Roy S. Luetterforst R. Harding A. Apolloni A. Etheridge M. Stang E. Rolls B. Hancock J.F. Parton R.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 98-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and Src (data not shown), it is unlikely that any of the above pathways are involved in the PI3K-dependent activation of MAPK by MβCD. Rather, we favor the hypothesis that the MβCD activation of MAPK is a consequence of the depletion of plasma membrane cholesterol. The cholesterol-depleting agent filipin also activated MAPK (Fig. 5 D). The MβCD effect on MAPK was blunted by adding back cholesterol (Fig. 5 C), as has also been shown by Furuchi and Anderson (20Furuchi T. Anderson R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21099-21104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Cholesterol levels in cells are sensed by sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (39Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11041-11048Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar), and it will be interesting to determine whether these endoplasmic reticulum-localized proteins are involved in the MβCD effect on MAPK. Alternatively, PI3K (40Yu W. Cassara J. Weller P.F. Blood. 2000; 95: 1078-1085Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and MAPK (41Yu W. Bozza P.T. Tzizik D.M. Gray J.P. Cassara J. Dvorak A.M. Weller P.F. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 152: 759-769PubMed Google Scholar) have been shown to be present on lipid droplets, cytoplasmic storage sites for triacylglycerides, and cholesterol (42van Meer G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: F29-F34Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that cholesterol depletion by MβCD might regulate signal transduction by these cytoplasmic organelles. Taken together, the data presented in the current study indicate that depletion of cholesterol from the cell plasma membrane results in a proliferative response and that MβCD has effects on cells beyond disruption of raft and caveolae structure.

I., Bussiere, M., Vance, D. E., Campenot, R. B., and Vance, J. E. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 3028–3035). We now report that inhibition of growth does not result from cell death since although ceramide is a known apoptotic agent, C6-ceramide given to the neurons for 24 h did not cause cell death but instead protected the neurons from death induced by deprivation of nerve growth factor (NGF). We also find that a pool of ceramide generated from sphingomyelin in distal axons, but not cell bodies, inhibits axonal growth. Analysis of endogenous sphingomyelinase activities demonstrated that distal axons are rich in neutral sphingomyelinase activity but contain almost no acidic sphingomyelinase, which is concentrated in cell bodies/proximal axons. Together, these observations are consistent with the idea that generation of ceramide from sphingomyelin by a neutral sphingomyelinase in axons inhibits axonal growth. Furthermore, we demonstrate that treatment of distal axons with ceramide inhibits the uptake of NGF and low density lipoproteins by distal axons by ∼70 and 40%, respectively, suggesting that the inhibition of axonal growth by ceramide might be due, at least in part, to impaired endocytosis of NGF. However, inhibition of endocytosis of NGF by ceramide could not be ascribed to decreased phosphorylation of TrkA.

The role that ceramide plays in neuronal apoptosis is, however, complex since in some types of cells ceramide protects against, rather than induces, apoptosis (32Ito A. Horigome K. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 463-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 33Irie F. Hirabayashi Y. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 54: 475-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 34Ping S.E.

Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Ceramide is also a regulator of axonal growth in neurons. We have shown previously that axonal extension is inhibited when distal axons of rat sympathetic neurons are incubated with either the ceramide analog, C6-ceramide,1 or with the glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor, PPMP. In contrast, when cell bodies are subjected to the same treatment, axonal growth is not impaired (36Posse de Chaves E.I. Bussiere M. Vance D.E. Campenot R.B. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3028-3035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Since distinct pools of ceramide can mediate different biological responses (37Linardic C.M. Hannun Y.A.

Chem. 1997; 272: 9609-9612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), we have now generated a pool of ceramide from cell surface sphingomyelin by treatment of distal axons with exogenously added bacterial sphingomyelinase, and we have shown that this pool of ceramide similarly inhibits axonal growth. The endogenous sphingomyelinase activity in distal axons is almost entirely a neutral sphingomyelinase, whereas the acidic sphingomyelinase is restricted to cell bodies/proximal axons. These observations suggest that a neutral sphingomyelinase in distal axons might generate the pool of ceramide that inhibits axonal growth. We have also confirmed that the inhibitory effect of ceramide on axonal elongation occurs independently of cell death and, moreover, that ceramide protects sympathetic neurons against apoptosis induced by NGF withdrawal. In addition, we show that ceramide inhibits the uptake of NGF by a mechanism that does not involve reduced phosphorylation of TrkA. Since axonal elongation of sympathetic neurons requires NGF, inhibition of axonal growth by ceramide might, at least in part, result from decreased endocytosis of NGF.

Na125I (mCi/mmol), [methyl-14C]sphingomyelin (45 mCi/mmol), and [methyl-3H]choline (15 Ci/mmol) were fromAmersham Pharmacia Biotech. C6-NBD-ceramide was purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Pleasant Gap, PA). The PD-10 Sephadex G-25m columns were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Immobilin polyvinylidene difluoride membranes used for immunoblotting were supplied by Millipore Corp. (Bedford, MA). Immunoreactivity was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence using SuperSignal West Dura Substrate (Pierce). All other reagents were from Sigma or Fisher. Sympathetic neurons were isolated from superior cervical ganglia of newborn Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats by treatment of the ganglia with trypsin 0.1% (w/v) and mechanical dissociation, as previously described (40Campenot R.B. Stevenson B.R. Gallin W.J. Paul D.L. Cell-Cell Interactions: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1992: 275-298Google Scholar, 41Campenot R.B. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 28: 302-307Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The basal culture medium was L15-CO2 supplemented with the prescribed additives and 6% methylcellulose. Non-neuronal cells were eliminated by supplying 10 μm cytosine arabinoside during the first 6–7 days of culture. Neurons were cultured in two types of culture dishes, either 24-well plates at a density of 2 ganglia/well (mass cultures) or 3-compartment culture dishes, constructed as described previously (40Campenot R.B. Stevenson B.R. Gallin W.J. Paul D.L. Cell-Cell Interactions: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1992: 275-298Google Scholar, 42Campenot R.B. J. Neurobiol. 1994; 25: 599-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Briefly, rat tail collagen was air-dried onto 35-mm culture dishes. Parallel scratches were made in the collagen substratum, and a Teflon divider was attached to the collagen surface with silicone grease. The neuronal cell suspension (2–3 × 103 neurons/dish) was plated in the center compartment of each dish. The axons extended at a rate of ∼1 mm/day into adjacent side compartments that contained 100 ng/ml NGF. Typically, neurons were cultured for 9–13 days prior to the start of an experiment. Neurons were plated in the center compartment of compartmented dishes. Distal axons were mechanically removed from left and right compartments with a jet of sterile water delivered with a syringe through a 22-gauge needle in a process termed “axotomy.” The water was aspirated and the wash repeated twice, after which fresh medium was added. This procedure effectively removes all visible traces of axons from the side compartments. Axonal extension was measured on individual tracks using an inverted microscope fitted with a digitizer that tracks stage movements to an accuracy of ±5 μm. Axonal extension was defined as the distance from the grease barrier to the furthest extending axon (40Campenot R.B. Stevenson B.R. Gallin W.J. Paul D.L. Cell-Cell Interactions: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1992: 275-298Google Scholar). Neurons were cultured in 24-well dishes for 12 days and then incubated with basal medium containing the indicated concentrations of C6-ceramide or C6-dihydroceramide in dimethyl sulfoxide. Control cultures were given equivalent amounts of dimethyl sulfoxide without the ceramide analog; the maximum final concentration of dimethyl sulfoxide to which the neurons were exposed was 0.5% (v:v). After 24 h, mitochondrial function was assessed using the Cell Titer 96 kit (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). Neurons were cultured in 24-well dishes for 9 days and then incubated with [3H]choline (10 μCi/ml) for 3 days to allow steady-state labeling of choline-containing lipids. At that time, neurons were treated with 500 milliunits/ml bacterial sphingomyelinase from Staphylococcus aureus for the indicated times. Cellular material was collected in methanol:water, 1:1 (v/v), and then chloroform was added to give a final ratio of chloroform:methanol:water of 2:1:1 (v/v). The lipids were extracted according to the procedure of Folch et al. (43Folch J. Lees M. Sloane-Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 226: 495-509Google Scholar) and separated by thin layer chromatography in the solvent system chloroform:methanol:acetic acid:formic acid:water, 70:30:12:4:2 (v/v). Bands corresponding to authentic phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin were scraped from the plates and radioactivity was measured. Aliquots of the organic phase were used to determine the amount of lipid phosphorus (44Zhou X. Arthur G. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 1233-1236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). C6-NBD-ceramide (20 μm) was supplied to either the center or side compartments of 13-day-old, center-plated compartmented cultures of neurons. After 24 h, the medium was aspirated, and the neurons were rinsed several times with ice-cold, Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl). Cellular material from the center and side compartments was harvested separately, and lipids were extracted. The amounts of lipid phosphorus and fluorescence were determined in aliquots from the organic phase. Fluorescence was quantitated using a Hitachi F-2000 fluorimeter (excitation wavelength 464 nm, emission wavelength 532 nm). Neutral and acidic sphingomyelinase activities were measured essentially as described previously (1Schissel S.L. Schuchman E.H. Williams K.J. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18431-18436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 45Okazaki T. Bielawska A. Dormae N. Bell R.N. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol.

Neurons were washed extensively with ice-cold, Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl) and collected in ice-cold buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors (0.1 μmaprotinin, 1 μm leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The cell extract was sonicated and then centrifuged for 5 min at 800 ×g. An aliquot (25 μl) of sonicate containing 20–30 μg of protein was typically used for the enzymatic assays. The substrate for each assay consisted of 60 pmol of [methyl-14C]sphingomyelin (45 mCi/mmol) and 900 pmol of unlabeled sphingomyelin in 25 μl of the following buffers. For determination of neutral sphingomyelinase activity, the buffer contained 0.2 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1% Triton X-100 and 10 mm MgCl2; the buffer used for measurement of acidic sphingomyelinase activity contained 0.2m sodium acetate (pH 5.0) and 0.1% Triton X-100. The enzymatic reaction was initiated by addition of substrate, and the samples were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by addition of CHCl3:CH3OH:H2O (2:1:1) (43Folch J. Lees M. Sloane-Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 226: 495-509Google Scholar). Radioactivity was measured in the aqueous phase that contained released [14C]phosphocholine. NGF was radioiodinated by the lactoperoxidase method (47Claude P. Hawrot E. Dunis D.A. Campenot R.B. J. Neurosci. 1982; 2: 431-442Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 48Ure D.R. Campenot R.B. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1282-1290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The following components were mixed at room temperature for 1 h: 3–5 μl (1.5 mCi) of Na125I, 10 μg of NGF (1 μg/ml), 37 μl of 0.5m potassium phosphate (pH 7.4), 10 μl of lactoperoxidase (33 μg/ml), and 10 μl of 0.003% H2O2. After 30 min, an additional 10 μl of H2O2were added. The reaction was terminated by addition of 5 μl of β-mercaptoethanol and 415 μl of bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml) in potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). 125I-NGF was precipitated by addition of an equal volume of 20% trichloroacetic acid. Unbound iodine was removed by passage through a Sephadex G-25M gel filtration column. Typical specific radioactivities of radioiodinated NGF were 200–300 cpm/pg protein. The125I-NGF was used within 2 weeks of its preparation. Molar concentrations of NGF were based on a molecular weight of 26,000. Human LDL were isolated from plasma by sequential ultracentrifugation (49Posse de Chaves E.I. Vance D.E. Campenot R.B. Kiss R.S. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19883-19890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and then radiolabeled with iodine monochloride (50Shepherd J. Bedford D.K. Morgan H.T. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1976; 66: 97-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) at 4 °C (pH 10) which resulted in almost no labeling of lipid. Unbound Na125I was removed by dialysis against saline/EDTA at 4 °C for 3–4 days. The specific radioactivity of 125I-labeled LDL was determined after precipitation of the protein with 10% trichloroacetic acid. Sympathetic neurons were plated in the center compartment of 3-compartment dishes and cultured for 7 days. Distal axons were removed and then allowed to regenerate for 4–5 days after which they were incubated in medium containing one of 10 μm C6-ceramide, 10 μm C6-dihydroceramide, or no ceramide analog. After 24 h, 125I-NGF (50 ng/ml) was added to distal axons in medium containing the same ceramide analogs, and the neurons were incubated for an additional 18 h during which time125I-NGF was retrogradely transported. Medium bathing cell bodies/proximal axons was collected first, and then cell bodies/proximal axons were harvested by addition of 10% sodium deoxycholate. Radioactivity was measured in both cellular material and culture medium from the cell body-containing compartment which together represented retrogradely transported 125I-NGF. For determination of the amount of 125I-NGF associated with distal axons, the axons were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C and then harvested by treatment with 10% deoxycholate. Radioactivity was measured, and the protein content was determined by the BCA assay (Pierce). The amount of retrogradely transported 125I-NGF was calculated as radioactivity in cell bodies/proximal axons combined with radioactivity in the medium bathing cell bodies/proximal axons. As in previous studies (48Ure D.R. Campenot R.B. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1282-1290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), background diffusion of 125I-NGF under the Teflon divider was negligible. Nonspecific binding and transport of125I-NGF were assessed by performing the same procedures with cultures in which distal axons were incubated with125I-NGF in the presence of a 100-fold higher concentration of unlabeled NGF. The specific transport and specific axon association of 125I-NGF were calculated by subtracting nonspecific values from the total amount of 125I bound and transported. Typically, the nonspecific transport of 125I-NGF into the center compartment accounted for less than 10% of the total transported, whereas the nonspecific association of125I-NGF with distal axons accounted for 45–55% of associated radioactivity (48Ure D.R. Campenot R.B. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1282-1290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Neurons were plated in the center compartment of compartmented dishes and cultured for 7 days. The neurons were then axotomized and allowed to regenerate for 5 days, after which one of 10 μm C6-ceramide, 10 μm C6-dihydroceramide, or no ceramide analog was incubated with distal axons for 24 h. Subsequently,125I-LDL (100 μg of cholesterol/ml) was added to distal axons for 18 h in the presence or absence of the same ceramide analog. The neurons were washed, and cellular material from center and side compartments was harvested separately and analyzed as described for uptake/transport of NGF. Neurons were plated in the center compartment of 3-compartmented dishes. After 7 days, the cells were axotomized, and axons were allowed to regenerate for 5 days. The incubation was continued for an additional 24 h either in the absence of ceramide or in the presence of C6-ceramide (10 μm) or C6-dihydroceramide (10 μm) in distal axons. During the first 18 h of this incubation, NGF (100 ng/ml) was present, whereas for the remaining 6 h the axons were incubated with medium lacking NGF so that the level of NGF-induced Trk phosphorylation was reduced to a basal level. Next, culture medium containing 100 ng/ml NGF was added for 15 min to induce TrkA phosphorylation. The extent of TrkA phosphorylation in distal axons was investigated by immunoblotting of proteins in lysates of distal axons. Sympathetic neurons that had been cultured in 24-well plates were washed with ice-cold Tris-buffered saline containing 1 mm sodium orthovanadate and 10 mmsodium fluoride. Cellular material pooled from 4 dishes was harvested into sample buffer containing 0.1% SDS and then boiled for 5 min. The proteins were electrophoresed on 8% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.1% SDS and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes in Tris:glycine buffer for 1 h at 4 °C. The membranes were incubated for 1 h in blocking buffer (5% horse serum and 0.1% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline), and the proteins were immunoblotted using the following antibodies at the indicated dilutions in blocking buffer: monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine clone 4G10 (1:5000, Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY); rabbit polyclonal anti-human TrkA C-14 (1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); monoclonal anti-rat β-tubulin (Tub 2.1, Sigma). Immunoreactivity was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. In some cases, as indicated, antibody was stripped from the membrane using Restore Western blot Stripping Buffer (Pierce) according to manufacturer's directions, and the blot was re-probed with a different antibody. We have reported previously that elevation of ceramide within distal axons of rat sympathetic neurons by two independent approaches inhibits axonal growth (36Posse de Chaves E.I. Bussiere M.

By contrast,Saccharomyces cerevisiae does not encode a protein closely related to eIF3e/Int-6. Here, we characterize a novel S. cerevisiae protein (Pci8p, Yil071cp) that contains a PCI (proteasome-COP9 signalosome-eIF3) domain conserved in eIF3e/Int-6. We show that both Pci8p and human eIF3e/Int-6 expressed in budding yeast interact with the yeast eIF3 complex in vivo and in vitro by binding to a discrete segment of its eIF3b subunit Prt1p and that human eIF3e/Int-6 interacts with the human eIF3b segment homologous to the Pci8p-binding site of yeast Prt1p. These results refine our understanding of subunit interactions in the eIF3 complex and suggest structural similarity between human eIF3e/Int-6 and yeast Pci8p. However, deletion of PCI8 had no discernible effect on cell growth or translation initiation as judged by polysome analysis, suggesting that Pci8p is not required for the essential function of eIF3 in translation initiation. Motivated by the involvement of Int-6 in transcriptional control, we investigated the effects of deletingPCI8 on the total mRNA expression profile by oligonucleotide microarray analysis and found reduced mRNA levels for a subset of heat shock proteins in the pci8Δ mutant.

Importantly, the five-subunit complex purified from budding yeast was sufficient to restore Met-tRNA iMet binding to 40 S ribosomes in a heat-inactivated extract from a prt1 mutant and thus possesses a key activity ascribed to mammalian eIF3 (11Phan L.

For these reasons, it was proposed that the five-subunit complex isolated from budding yeast represents a catalytically active “core” complex of the critical eIF3 subunits (11Phan L. Zhang X.

Two of the eIF3 subunits containing the PCI/PINT domain, eIF3a and eIF3c, may be regarded as core subunits (as they are present in the five-subunit budding yeast eIF3), whereas the third, eIF3e, appears to be a peripheral eIF3 subunit. The gene encoding eIF3e in S. pombe, int6 +, is not essential, but strains lacking this gene grow more slowly than the wild-type strain and display moderate reductions in the rate of translation initiation (7Bandyopadhyay A. Matsumoto T. Maitra U. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4005-4018Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar,9Akiyoshi Y. Clayton J. Phan L. Yamamoto M. Hinnebusch A.G. Watanabe Y. Asano K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10056-10062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Thus, eIF3e/Int6 in S. pombe may play an accessory role in the general function of eIF3 or may be required only for translation of specific mRNAs. In addition to its proposed role in translation as an eIF3 subunit, human eIF3e and the mouse homolog (Int-6) have been implicated in the control of cell growth and tumorigenesis as well as transcriptional regulation (16Asano K.

Buttitta F. Miyazaki S. Gallahan D. Smith G.H. Callahan R. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1932-1938Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and expression of Int-6 is decreased in a consistent portion of human breast and lung carcinomas (20Marchetti A. Buttitta F. Pellegrini S.

In fission yeast, eIF3e/Int6 was identified as an inducer of multidrug resistance genes dependent on AP-1 transcription factor Pap1p (8Crane R. Craig R. Murray R. Dunand-Sauthier I. Humphrey T. Norbury C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3993-4003Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and int6Δ mutants display both caffeine sensitivity (7Bandyopadhyay A. Matsumoto T. Maitra U. Mol. Biol.

Matsui M. Deng X.-W. Chamovitz D.A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), a multifunctional nuclear complex that may be involved in transcriptional regulation (26Wei N. Deng X.-W. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 98-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Thus, there is accumulating evidence that Int-6 functions in the nucleus in the transcriptional control of gene expression, although the nuclear localization of Int-6 could still be interpreted as a means of sequestering it from eIF3 (27Yahalom A. Kim T.H. Winter E. Karniol B. von Arnim A.G. Chamovitz D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 334-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In contrast, little is known about the molecular interactions of human eIF3e/Int-6 with the eIF3 core complex or its possible effect on eIF3 activity in translation. Eight PCI proteins have been recognized in the proteome of budding yeast (14Hofmann K. Bucher P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 204-205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 15Aravind L. Ponting C.P. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1250-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). These include five 26 S proteasomal subunits 2Each of the eight COP9 signalosome subunits is apparently similar to one of the eight proteasome lid subunits (26Wei N. Deng X.-W. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 98-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Since the signalosome subunit CSN8 contains a PCI domain, the proteasome lid counterpart Rpn12p/PSMD8 may also have a PCI domain, although the Conserved Domain Database search does not predict this. If this is the case, then Rpn12p may be the ninth PCI protein in budding yeast. ; the eIF3 core subunits eIF3a/Tif32p and eIF3c/Nip1p; and a hypothetical protein encoded by YIL071c or YIH1 (15Aravind L. Ponting C.P. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1250-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), which we designate Pci8p. The absence of a third PCI subunit in S. cerevisiae eIF3 led us to consider that Pci8p could be a distantly related ortholog of the non-core subunit eIF3e that might still interact physically or functionally with the eIF3 core complex in this yeast. Hence, we set out to analyze biochemically and genetically this last uncharacterized PCI protein in budding yeast. By comparing Pci8p with eIF3e/Int-6 in different binding reactions, we discovered that eIF3b/Prt1p is a common binding partner in the eIF3 core complex for both Pci8p and human eIF3e/Int-6. Furthermore, the minimal binding site for Pci8p in yeast eIF3b is homologous to that which we identified for human eIF3e/Int-6 in human eIF3b. This conservation of binding domains suggests a common ancestry and functional similarity between Int-6 and Pci8p. To investigate the cellular role of Pci8p in budding yeast, we created a pci8Δ deletion mutant and found that Pci8p is not essential and does not have any detectable effect on general translation initiation. Given its ability to interact physically with eIF3, it is still possible that Pci8p regulates translation of specific mRNAs or under restricted growth conditions. Based on the role of Int-6 in transcriptional control, we used oligonucleotide microarray analysis to compare the gene expression profiles of pci8Δand wild-type cells and detected changes in mRNA expression for several heat shock genes. Thus, Pci8p may be involved in transcriptional control. The oligodeoxyribonucleotides and plasmids used in this study are listed in Tables I andII, respectively. pAV1427 encodes N-terminally FLAG- and polyhistidine-tagged Gcd6p under the control of the GAL promoter (28Gomez E. Pavitt G.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3965-3976Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) with a unique MluI site located between the coding regions for the N-terminal tags and the first codon of Gcd6p. The DNA segments containing the humanint-6 ORF were synthesized from pTZp48 (16Asano K. Merrick W.C. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23477-23480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) by PCR using primers 1 and 2 and primers 1 and 3 (Table I), of which primer 3 introduces a FLAG epitope coding sequence fused in-frame to the 3′-end of the int-6 ORF. After digestion with MluI andBamHI, the fragments were inserted into the 5′-MluI and 3′-BamHI sites of pAV1427 to produce pEMBL-Int-6-5′FL and pEMBL-Int-6-2×FL, respectively. Similarly, the DNA segments encoding yeast Pci8p were synthesized from yeast chromosomal DNA by PCR using primers 4 and 5 and primers 4 and 6, digested with MluI and BamHI, and subcloned into pAV1427 to produce pEMBL-PCI8-5′FL and pEMBL-PCI8-2×FL, respectively. The N-terminal tag coding sequences in pEMBL-Int-6-2×FL and pEMBL-PCI8-2×FL were removed by SacI and MluI digestion, fill-in with Klenow enzyme, and self-ligation, generating pEMBL-Int-6-3′FL and pEMBL-PCI8-3′FL, respectively. Each of these six plasmids was introduced into yeast strain H2557 (see Table III) and examined for expression of the encoded tagged Int-6 or Pci8p protein following induction on galactose-containing medium. As pEMBL-Int-6-5′FL and pEMBL-PCI8-3′FL produced the largest amounts of FLAG-tagged Int-6 and Pci8p, respectively (data not shown), they were selected for further analyses.Table IOligonucleotides used in this studyPrimer numbersSequence (5′ to 3′)aIntroduced restriction enzyme recognition sites are underlined.DescriptionTag 1CCCACGCGTATGGCGGAGTACGACTTGAC5′-End of int-6 ORFMluI 2CCCGGATCCTCAGTAGAAGCCAGAATCTTGAG3′-End ofint-6 ORFBamHI 3CCCGGATCCTCATTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCGTAGAAGCCAGAATCTTGAG3′-End of int-6 ORFBamHI, FLAG 4CCCACGCGTATGTTTCATGGCGCTAAAGGACC5′-End ofPCI8 ORFMluI 5CCCGGATCCTCAGCATTCAAACAAACCTCCC3′-End ofPCI8 ORFBamHI 6CCCGGATCCTCATTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCGCATTCAAACAAACCTCCCTC3′-End of PCI8 ORFBamHI, FLAG 7CCCAGATCTGCTTTGAATCAGTCTGCTGAGG5′-End ofPCI8 5′-UTRBglII 8CCCGGATCCACGCGTTTAGATGTCGAGAAGCTGCC3′-End ofPCI8 5′-UTRBamHI, MluI 9CCCGGATCCGTCTATTCTGAAGCTCTTTCTCCG3′-End ofPCI8 3′-UTRBamHI10TGAAGTTGTTCAAGATGATTCCMiddle of PCI811AGAAAGGTGACCTACCCCCpAV1427 3′ of insert12CCCGAATTCATGGCGGAGTACGACTTGACTACTCGC5′-End ofint-6 ORFEcoRI13CCCGAATTCCATATGTTTCATGGCGCTAAAGGACC5′-End ofPCI8 ORFEcoRI, NdeI14CCCGAATTCGTGTCCGAGGACGCGGG5′-End of human eIF3bΔEcoRI15CCCGGATCCCCCCGTAAGGATGTCCCAG3′-End of human eIF3bΔBamHI16ATGCGTAAGCGGGTGTTGTCComplementary tohisG(Ref. 31Asano K.

Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2522) Google Scholar) to generate YCpPCI8. YCpPCI8-FL, encoding FLAG-tagged Pci8p under the control of its own promoter, was constructed by replacing the 1.0-kbNsiI-BamHI segment of YCpPCI8 with a 0.5-kbNsiI-BamHI segment of pEMBL-PCI8-3′FL containing the 3′-half of the FLAG-tagged PCI8 ORF. The deletion plasmid pPCI8Δ-URA3 was constructed in two steps. First, the 3′-UTR segment of PCI8 was synthesized by PCR using primers 10 and 9 and digested with BclI and BamHI, which cleave at sites immediately following the PCI8 stop codon and at the end of primer 9, respectively. The resulting 0.5-kb fragment was subcloned into the BamHI site of pNKY51 (30Alani E. Cao L. Kleckner N. Genetics. 1987; 116: 541-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar) 3′ of thehisG::URA3::hisGcassette. Second, the 5′-UTR of PCI8 was amplified with primers 7 and 8, digested with BglII and BamHI, and subcloned into the BglII site of the pNKY51 derivative produced in the first step 5′ of thehisG::URA3::hisGcassette. To construct plasmids encoding GST-Int-6 and GST-Pci8p fusion proteins, the int-6 and PCI8 coding segments were generated by PCR with primers 12 and 11 and primers 13 and 11, respectively, using pEMBL-Int-6-5′FL and pEMBL-PCI8-5′FL as templates for PCR. The resulting PCR fragments were digested with EcoRI andBamHI and subcloned between the 5′-EcoRI and 3′-BglII sites of pGEX-TIF35 (31Asano K. Phan L. Anderson J. Hinnebusch A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18573-18585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), a derivative of pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), to generate pGEX-Int-6 and pGEX-PCI8, respectively. To generate pGEX-p116Δ, the DNA segment encoding residues 124–413 of human eIF3b was amplified with primers 14 and 15 using KST7hPrt1-6 (32Methot N. Rom E. Olsen H. Sonenberg N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1110-1116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) as template, digested withEcoRI and BamHI, and subcloned into pGEX-TIF35. The yeast strains used are listed in TableIII. To generate the pci8Δdeletion strain KAY76, the BglII-BamHI fragment from plasmid pPCI8Δ-URA3 containing the entirepci8Δ::hisG::URA3::hisGdisruption allele was introduced into a transformant of H2557 carrying YCpPCI8 (PCI8 LEU2). After excluding Leu+Ura+ strains with the deletion construct integrated into YCpPCI8, deletion of PCI8 in the candidate strains was confirmed by amplifying the 5′ and 3′ ends of the deletion construct, which had been integrated into the chromosome, by PCR using primers 16 and 19, and 17 and 18 (Table I), respectively. Primers 18 and 19 correspond to yeast chromosomal sequences outside of the region covered by the deletion construct, whereas primers 16 and 17 correspond to sequences inside the deletion construct in the hisG repeats flanking the URA3 marker. We confirmed that the amplified DNA fragments were generated from the expected sites by restriction digest of the 5′- and 3′-fragments. YCpPCI8 was allowed to segregate from the pci8Δ deletion strain by culturing in rich medium (yeast extract/peptone/dextrose (YPD)), and the progeny cells were streaked out for purification. One of the Leu−Ura+ segregants, designated KAY76 (pci8Δ), was selected for further analysis. The isogenicURA3+ wild-type strain H2557U was constructed by transforming H2557 with YIplac211 (URA3+ without yeast replicon) (29Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2522) Google Scholar) that had been linearized with EcoRV to direct integration to the ura3-52 locus. Strain KAY76 (pci8Δ::URA3) and isogenicURA3 + wild-type H2557U were grown in 250 ml of YPD medium at 30 °C for 6 h, reaching anA600 of 1.0 during exponential growth. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed, mixed with an equal volume of acid-washed and autoclaved glass beads (425–600 μm; Sigma) and 7.5 ml of Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.), and vortexed eight times for 30 s each with 30-s intervals at room temperature. Total RNA was extracted according to the remaining instructions provided by the manufacturer. Poly(A)+ mRNA was prepared from total RNA using the RNeasy kit (QIAGEN Inc.) following the manufacturer's instructions. The buffer was removed, and the sample was concentrated by ethanol precipitation. Further sample preparation, cDNA synthesis, in vitro transcription, and labeling and fragmentation to produce the oligonucleotide probes were performed as instructed by the GeneChip manufacturer (Affymetrix). The probes were first hybridized to a test array (Affymetrix) and then to the GeneChip yeast genome S98 (Affymetrix), both performed at 45 °C overnight in a rotisserie box. The chips were washed in a GeneChip Fluidics Station 400 (Affymetrix), and the results were visualized and analyzed with a Gene Array scanner (Hewlett-Packard Co.) using the Affymetrix software. The eIF3e/Int-6 protein (445 amino acids, 52,187 Da) is a component of mammalian eIF3 (16Asano K. Merrick W.C. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23477-23480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and contains a conserved domain termed PCI (14Hofmann K. Bucher P. Trends Biochem.

Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1250-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Budding yeast homologs have been identified for five of the mammalian eIF3 subunits, but not for Int-6. As the hypothetical S. cerevisiae Pci8p protein (444 amino acids, 51,254 Da; GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank accession number P40512) contains a PCI/PINT domain (14Hofmann K. Bucher P. Trends Biochem.

Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1250-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and shows no similarity to any other proteins, 3According to the YPDTM Database at www.proteome.com/. we considered the possibility that Pci8p might be a distantly related, functional ortholog of Int-6. To investigate whether Pci8p and its possible human counterpart (Int-6) could bind to yeast eIF3 in vivo, we constructed plasmids pEMBL-Int-6-5′FL and pEMBL-PCI8-3′FL for expressing FLAG epitope-tagged versions of these proteins under the control of a galactose-inducible (GAL) promoter. The plasmids were introduced into S. cerevisiae H2557, and the resulting transformants were grown on galactose-containing medium. Whole cell extracts (WCEs) were prepared from the transformants and subjected to Western analysis using antibodies against the FLAG epitope to characterize the expression levels of FLAG-Int-6 and FLAG-Pci8p. The WCE from strain KAY35 encoding FLAG-eIF5 as the sole source of this initiation factor (Table III) was analyzed in parallel for comparison. FLAG-Int-6 migrated at 52 kDa and was expressed at a level approximately one-fourth that of FLAG-eIF5. FLAG-Pci8p also migrated at 52 kDa and was expressed at a level ∼10-fold higher than that of FLAG-eIF5 (data not shown). To determine whether FLAG-Pci8p and FLAG-Int-6 can bind to yeast eIF3in vivo, WCEs from the H2557 transformants just described or from a control transformant bearing an empty vector were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG affinity resin, and the immune complexes were subjected to Western analysis using antibodies against the FLAG epitope, yeast eIF3b subunit Prt1p, and yeast eIF2α subunit Sui2p. The results shown in Fig.1 A indicate that nearly all of FLAG-Int-6 and ∼20% of FLAG-Pci8p were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG resin (indicated by arrows in the first row, lanes 5 and 8). Interestingly, ∼20% of Prt1p (second row, lanes 5 and 8), but little or no eIF2α (third row, lanes 5 and8), co-immunoprecipitated with both FLAG-Int-6 and FLAG-Pci8p. Under these conditions, nearly all of Prt1p in the WCE was incorporated into yeast eIF3, as indicated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments with antibodies against eIF3a subunit Tif32p (data not shown). These results suggest that human Int-6 and Pci8p can interact specifically with yeast eIF3 in vivo. In an effort to confirm these findings in vitrousing purified proteins, we constructed GST fusions to Int-6 and Pci8p, purified them from bacteria (see Fig. 1 B (upper panel) for Coomassie Blue staining of these proteins), and tested them for interaction with eIF3 purified from yeast. This eIF3 preparation contains polyhistidine-tagged eIF3b/Prt1p, FLAG-tagged eIF3g/Tif35p, and hemagglutinin-tagged eIF3i/Tif34p and was purified by nickel chelation chromatography,"

McLachlan A.D. Klug A. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1609-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1705) Google Scholar), represent an important class of eukaryotic transcription factors. To date, numerous genes have been found that encode this type of zinc finger motif, and many of their products have been implicated in various regulatory roles. The TFIIIA-type zinc finger tetrahedrally coordinates a zinc atom to form a compact structure that interacts with the major groove of DNA in a sequence-specific manner. Generally, in animals, multiple zinc finger motifs are present as tandem arrays that are separated by a conserved short sequence known as an HC link (2Schuh R. Aicher W. Gaul U. Cote S. Preiss A.

The proteins of this family are characterized by the long (19–65 amino acids) linkers of various lengths that separate the zinc fingers. Moreover, the zinc finger motif itself contains a highly conserved sequence, QALGGH (12Takatsuji H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Felsenfeld G. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 122-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Our previous DNA binding studies showed that ZPT2–2, with a linker of 44 amino acids between the two fingers, interacted with two tandemly repeated AGT core sites, which were separated by 10 bp,1 at a dissociation constant (K d) of 120 nm (14Takatsuji H. Matsumoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23368-23373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The binding affinity was sensitive to the spacing between the two core sites. Another protein, ZPT2–1, with a linker of 61 amino acids, showed a different preference for the spacing in target DNA. In light of these observations and considering the diverse lengths of the linker region among the members of this protein family, we proposed that EPF proteins recognize their cognate DNAs not only by the sequences of the core sites but also by the spacing between the core sites (13Kubo K. Sakamoto A. Kobayashi A. Rybka Z. Kanno Y. Nakagawa H. Nishino T. Takatsuji H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 608-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 14Takatsuji H. Matsumoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23368-23373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The binding affinity of ZPT2–2 to the tandemly repeated two AGT sequences is, however, rather weak (K d = 120 nm) compared with those reported for other transcription factors and their cognate binding sequences (K d = 0.1–1.0 nm). This weak affinity could be because of the suboptimal affinities of the respective fingers to the AGT core sequences. These speculations led us to perform SAAB imprinting assays to identify optimal binding sequences of ZPT2–2 from random sequences. We then quantitatively characterized selected sequences by using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis. These experiments have revealed optimal binding sequences for the respective zinc fingers of ZPT2–2 and corroborated our previous conclusion regarding the specificity for the spacing between the two core sites. Moreover, our current results revealed some new features in the protein-DNA interaction of ZPT2–2. These observations allowed us to propose a revised model for the interaction between DNA and ZPT2–2, which is unique among eukaryotic DNA-binding proteins. To construct the plasmids for the production of recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli, we used the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify DNA sequences encoding the N-terminal zinc finger of ZPT2–2 (F1), the C-terminal one (F2), or both by using an upstream primer containing an XbaI site at its 5′ end and a downstream primer with a PstI site at its 5′ end. Reaction products were digested with XbaI andPstI and were inserted into the pBluescript KS+(Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) vector to yield pBS-ZPT2–2-F1, -F2, and -F12. To insert a TEV protease site upstream of the coding sequences, synthetic double-stranded DNA for a TEV site with anEcoRV site at its 5′ terminus was inserted between theSacI and XbaI sites of pBS-ZPT2–2-F1, -F2, and -F12. These plasmids were digested with EcoRV andPstI, and the resulting fragments were inserted between theXmnI and PstI sites of the expression vector pMAL-c2 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) in-frame with the coding sequence of the maltose-binding protein to yield pMAL-(TEV)-ZPT2–2-F1, -F2, and -F12. E. coli BL21 cells were transfected with pMAL-(TEV)-ZPT2–2-F1, -F2, and -F12, and the transformants were grown at 37 °C in LB medium with ampicillin (0.1 mg/ml). After bacterial growth reached an A 600 of 0.3–0.6, the culture was supplied with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.5 mm and allowed to grow for an additional 3 h. The cells were harvested, resuspended in Buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.01 mmZnSO4, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.02% Tween 20), and sonicated with a Sonifier 250 (Branson, Danbury, CT). The resulting cell lysate was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 15 min, and the supernatant was loaded onto an amylose resin affinity column (New England Biolabs). After the column was washed with Buffer A, bound proteins were eluted by using Buffer A containing 10 mmmaltose. The eluates then were subjected to Hitrap Q (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column chromatography with a linear gradient of 0–1.0 m KCl in Buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 0.01 mm ZnSO4). Pooled fractions of fusion proteins were dialyzed against Buffer A and subjected to proteolytic digestion with TEV protease (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 16 °C for 10 h. The reaction mixture was loaded onto an SP column (Waters, Milford, MA) and eluted with a linear gradient of 0–1.0 m KCl in Buffer B. The fractions of zinc finger proteins were further purified on a C-8 reverse-phase column (Waters) by using a 0–100% gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. The purified proteins were then lyophilized, dissolved in 20 mm dithiothreitol, pH 10, and dialyzed against a buffer containing 25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, and 0.01 mm ZnCl2 to reconstitute the zinc atoms in the proteins. Gel shift assays were performed as follows. Purified proteins were incubated with 5000 counts/min of probes (HR5 and HR6), which were labeled with 32P using T4 polynucleotide kinase, at room temperature for 30 min in a binding buffer containing 25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 40 mm KCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.01 mmZnCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. After the reaction, the mixtures were run on an 8% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE buffer to separate DNA-protein complexes from excess probe. Hydroxyl radical footprinting was performed as described elsewhere (14Takatsuji H. Matsumoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23368-23373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) by using the [32P] end-labeled double-stranded DNA probes shown: HR5, 5′-CTAGACCGGTTTGGGCCCAAACAGTGGTTGGCCAAAGCTAAACCCGGGTTTGGGCG-3′; HR6, 5′-GATCCCCGGTTTGGGCCCAAAAGCTGTTAACAGTAAAACCCGG- GTTTGGCCC-3′. An optimal binding sequence for ZPT2–2 was identified by using the SAAB imprinting assay (15Blackwell T.K. Weintraub H. Science. 1990; 250: 1104-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar, 16Denny P. Swift S. Connor F. Ashworth A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3705-3712Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Purified PF12 proteins were incubated at room temperature for 30 min with a mixture of [32P] end-labeled, double-stranded, 55-bp oligonucleotides containing a central stretch of random sequence (25 bp) and unique sequences of 15 bp at each end for primer-binding sites. The mixtures were subjected to gel shift assays as described above, and DNA bands were made visible by using autoradiography. DNA-protein complexes were eluted from the gel by using 0.5 m ammonium acetate, and the DNA was amplified by 30 cycles of PCR in the presence of [32P]-labeled nucleotides. These procedures of gel shift assays and PCR were repeated for several rounds. Real-time analysis of the interaction between ZPT2–2 and DNA was performed by using the BIAcore biosensor (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) based on SPRs that are related to the number of molecules bound to the DNA on the sensor surface. Double-stranded oligonucleotides biotinylated at their 5′ ends were immobilized on a streptavidin-preimmobilized sensor chip (SA; BIAcore AB). The sequences of the oligonucleotides were as follows (core sites are underlined): AGC, 5′-CGCCAGAAGCGTCATTT-3′; CAGT, 5′-ATTTGACAGTACACGCC-3′; CAGT-2-AGC, 5′-GGCCGTCATTTGACAGTAAAGCGTCATTTGAGGCCG-3′; CAGT-6-AGC, 5′-GGCCGTCATTTGACAGTACAAGAAGCGTCATTTGAGGCCG-3′; CAGT-8-AGC, 5′-GGCCGTCATTTGACAGTACACCAGAAGCGTCATTTGAGGCCG-3′; CAGT-10-AGC(G), 5′-GGCCGTCATTTGACAGTACACGCCAGAAGCGTCATTTGAGGCCG-3′; CAGT-12-AGC, 5′-GGCCGTCATTTGACAGTACACGCGCCAGAAGCGTCATTTGAGGCCG-3′; CAGT-14-AGC, 5′-GGCCGTCATTTGACAGTACACGCGCGCCAGAAGCGTCATTTGAGGCCG-3′; CAGT-18-AGC, 5′-GGCCGTCATTTGACAGTACACGCGCGCGCGCCAGAAGCGTCATTTGAGGCCG-3′; AGC-3-CAGT, 5′-GGCCGTCATTTGAAGCGATCAGTGTCATTTGTGGCCG-3′; AGC-5-CAGT, 5′-GGCCGTCATTTGAAGCGACATCAGTGTCATTTGTGGCCG-3′; AGC-7-CAGT, 5′-GGCCGTCATTTGAAGCGACCCATCAGTGTCATTTGTGGCCG-3′; AGC-9-CAGT, 5′-GGCCGTCATTTGAAGCGACCGCCATCAGTGTCATTTGTGGCCG-3′; CAGT-10-TGCT, 5′-GGCCGTCATTTGACAGTACACGCCAGATGCTTCATTTGAGGCCG-3′; GCT-7-CAGT, 5′-GGCCGTCATTTGGGCTGACCCATCAGTGTCATTTGTGGCCG-3′; AGC-7-CAGT-10-AGC, 5′-GGCCGTCATTTGAAGCGACCCATCAGTACACGCCAGAAGCGTCATTTGAGGCCG-3′; CAGT-10-AGCT, 5′-GGCCGTCATTTGACAGTACACGCCAGAAGCTGTCATTTGAGGCCG-3′; AGCT-7-CAGT, 5′-GGCCGTCATTTGGAGCTGACCCATCAGTGTCATTTGTGGCCG-3′; PROM, 5′-ATAGATAGAAGCTCAGTCGT- AGCCAAAAGCTTTACCATAT-3′. These DNAs were applied to the surface of a sensor chip for a contact time of 5 min, resulting in the capture of 400–1000 response units of the oligonucleotides. Each binding cycle was performed by injecting ZPT2–2 proteins into a constant flow (10 μl/min) of HBPZ buffer (25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 150 mm KCl, 0.01 mm ZnCl2, and 0.02% Tween 20) across the surface via a sample loop. The sensor chip then was washed with HBPZ buffer for an additional 500–1000 s to measure dissociation rates. All reactions were carried out at 25 °C. Data were collected at 2 Hz and analyzed by using the BIAEvaluation program 2.1 (BIAcore AB). We assumed that the reaction between immobilized DNA and ZPT2–2 follows the first-order kinetics model in the following equation,ZPT2–2+DNA↔koffkonZPT2–2­DNA,Equation 1 where k on is the apparent association rate constant, and k off is the dissociation rate constant. To reveal the optimal binding sequences for ZPT2–2, a truncated form of ZPT2–2 (PF12) that included both the N-terminal (F1) and C-terminal (F2) zinc fingers was expressed in E. coli (Fig.1 A), purified to homogeneity (Fig. 1 B), and subjected to SAAB imprinting assays. The PF12 protein was incubated with various end-labeled 55-bp oligonucleotides, each of which included a 25-bp central stretch of randomized sequence and binding sites for PCR primers at both ends. The PF12-bound oligonucleotides were separated from unbound oligonucleotides by using gel electrophoresis (Fig.2 A), eluted from the gel, amplified by PCR, and subjected to further rounds of selection by SAAB imprinting procedure.Figure 2SAAB imprint assay. Gel shift assays from the (A) first and (B) fourth rounds of selection for optimal ZPT2–2 binding sequences are shown. Concentrations of PF12 are shown at the top oflanes. The bands indicated byarrowheads were recovered for further processes of SAAB imprinting experiments as shown under “Experimental Procedures.”Bands indicated by open circles are due presumably to 1:2 DNA:protein complexes.

The K d of the interaction between PF12 and the oligonucleotides after five rounds of selection was similar to that after four rounds (K d= 2.9 nm; Fig. 2, B and C), which indicated saturation of the selection. Hence, we amplified, cloned, and sequenced the oligonucleotides from the fourth round of selection. A sequence of CAGT was found in all clones (Fig. 2 D), which suggests that this sequence is the binding site for one of the two zinc fingers. This result is consistent with our previous findings demonstrating that the core binding sites of ZPT2–2 are AGT (14Takatsuji H. Matsumoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23368-23373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Further, this current result indicates that a cytosine just upstream of the AGT also is recognized during binding. Our previous results led us to expect another AGT ∼10 bp upstream or downstream of the CAGT sequence (14Takatsuji H. Matsumoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23368-23373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, however, such a sequence was not found in any of the clones; instead, an AGC or AGG was found within the randomized region or primer binding sequences at various distances (upstream, downstream, or both) from the CAGT sequences. The sequences could be classified into the following three categories: type I, AGC(T) present at 10–12 bp downstream of the CAGT site (CAGT-10∼12-AGC(T)); type II, AGG present at 10–12 bp downstream of the CAGT site (CAGT-10∼12-AGG); and type III, AGC present at both 4–6 bp downstream and 7 or 8 bp upstream of the CAGT site. Separated by 7 or 8 bp from the CAGT site, an upstream AGC(T) was also present in most of the type I sequences. These results suggest that one of the two zinc fingers of ZPT2–2 recognizes the CAGT, and the other finger has affinity for AGC(T) or AGG. Binding affinities to the selected sequences as determined by gel shift assays are shown in Fig. 2 D. The K d values for type I sequences (0.45–1.9 nm) were much lower than those for type II sequences (3.4–11 nm). This suggests that ZPT2–2 prefers AGC to AGG for its binding site. To characterize the roles of the respective zinc fingers of ZPT2–2 in its interaction with DNA, recombinant proteins containing only a single zinc finger were prepared (PF1 and PF2; see Fig. 1) and examined for DNA binding activity. Because the gel shift assay was not sensitive enough to detect the weak binding activity of the single zinc finger, we instead used an SPR technique. PF1 showed weak binding to the AGC site (K d = 150 ± 60 μm; see Fig.3A and Table I), and its binding to the CAGT site was undetectable. In comparison, PF2 bound to both the CAGT site (K d = 4.7 ± 0.1 μm) and the AGC site (K d = 78 ± 20 μm; see Fig.3 B and Table I). Therefore, F1 can bind only to the AGC site, whereas F2 can bind to both sites, and its affinity for the CAGT site is much higher than that for AGC. When a probe containing both the core sites (CAGT-10-AGC) was tested, theK d values were 120 ± 40 μm for PF1, 3.9 ± 0.4 μm for PF2, and 14 ± 1 nm for PF12 (see Fig.3 D and Table I). Therefore, the binding affinity of the two zinc fingers together is two to three orders of magnitude higher than that of either single finger. This indicates that the two sites in PF12 act cooperatively upon binding to DNA. Hydroxyl radical footprinting experiments using PF12 revealed footprints at the CATG and the AGCT sites in a probe containing the CAGT-10-AGCT sequence (Fig. 4), indicating that ZPT2–2 indeed interacted with both binding sites. In light of our current understanding, we propose here a model for the process by which ZPT2–2 binds to its target DNA sequence.Table IKinetic constants for the binding of truncated ZPT2–2 proteins as determined by using the SPR techniquePeptideCore sequencek onk offK dm−1s−1s−1mF1CAGT≥4.0 × 10−4AGC((2.2 ± 0.5) × 103(3.3 ± 2.0) × 10−1(1.5 ± 0.6) × 10−4CAGT-10-AGC(2.9 ± 0.6) × 103(3.5 ± 1.8) × 10−1(1.2 ± 0.4) × 10−4F2CAGT(1.4 ± 0.1) × 104(6.6 ± 0.1) × 10−2(4.7 ± 0.1) × 10−6AGC(3.0 ± 0.3) × 103(2.0 ± 0.3) × 10−1(7.8 ± 2.0) × 10−5CAGT-10-AGC(2.4 ± 0.3) × 104(9.4 ± 0.8) × 10−2(3.9 ± 0.4) × 10−6F12CAGT(2.6 ± 0.4) × 104(5.8 ± 0.3) × 10−2(2.3 ± 0.3) × 10−6AGC(2.2 ± 0.7) × 103(1.6 ± 0.1) × 10−1(7.9 ± 1.8) × 10−5CAGT-10-AGC(1.1 ± 0.2) × 106(1.5 ± 0.1) × 10−2(1.4 ± 0.1) × 10−8CAGT-11-GCT(1.1 ± 0.2) × 106(5.9 ± 0.1) × 10−2(5.3 ± 0.1) × 10−8AGC-7-CAGT(7.0 ± 0.5) × 105(3.1 ± 0.1) × 10−2(4.4 ± 0.3) × 10−8GCT-7-CAGT(6.5 ± 0.1) × 105(2.5 ± 0.1) × 10−2(4.0 ± 0.9) × 10−8Values shown represent the mean ± S.

K 1is an affinity constant for the first interaction of F1 to the AGC site; this constant can be approximated by the K dfor the binding of PF1 to the AGC site (Table I).K 2 is an equilibrium constant for the second interaction of F2 to the CAGT site, and this interaction is dependent on the prior binding of F1 to the AGC site. K 1′ is an affinity constant for the first interaction between F2 and the CATG site; this constant can be approximated by theK d of PF2 to the CAGT.K 2′ is an equilibrium constant for the second interaction by F1 to the AGC site, and this interaction is dependent on the prior binding of F2 to the CAGT site. As described previously, the affinity of F2 for CAGT is more than 30-fold higher than that of F1 for AGC; this difference is because of both an increased association rate (k on) and a decreased dissociation rate (k off; Table I). Therefore, PF12(F2)–DNA° represents a major intermediate, and the binding reaction can be approximated by the two equilibrium constantsK 1′ and K 2′. In light of these considerations, we conclude that, upon the binding of ZPT2–2 to the CAGT-10-AGC sequence, F2 makes the first interaction by preferentially binding to the CAGT site; this action is followed by the binding of F1 to the AGC site. Although the interaction of F1 with the AGC site is relatively weak, it helps to stabilize the ZPT2–2-DNA complex when the F1-AGC interaction occurs in conjunction with the binding of F2 to the CAGT site. In some sequences that were selected by the SAAB imprinting procedure, an AGC(T) sequence is present upstream of the CAGT site in addition to the downstream AGC(T) (Fig. 2 D). The sequence AGC(T) can be regarded as two overlapping AGCs on two different strands. To examine whether these upstream AGC(T) sequences serve as binding sites, a model probe that contains an AGC sequence 7 bp upstream of the CAGT site (AGC-7-CAGT) was tested for its binding to PF12. The AGC-7-CAGT probe bound to PF12 at aK d of 44 ± 3 nm (Table I), which indicates that the upstream AGC(T) sequences serve as binding sites for ZPT2–2. Hydroxyl radical footprinting experiments revealed a footprint at this upstream AGCT, along with that of the CATG site (Fig. 4). This indicates that ZPT2–2 indeed interacted with both binding sites in this configuration, and F1 interacted with the AGC(T) site. In the sequences selected by the SAAB imprinting procedure, the nucleotide T frequently followed the AGC. We used model probes to examine the molecular basis underlying this sequence preference. PF12 showed stronger binding to CAGT-10-AGCT than to CAGT-10-AGCG (Fig. 5). The same preference (AGCT-7-CAGT > AGC-7-CAGT; see Fig. 5) was observed when the F1-binding site was located upstream of the F2-binding site. Therefore, PF12 prefers T at the position following AGC, regardless of which side of the F2-binding site (CATG) this F1-binding site may be located on. When F1-binding sites (AGC) were placed on both sides of the F2-binding site (i.e. AGC-7-CAGT-10-AGC), the affinity of PF12 for this probe was slightly higher than that for AGC-7-CAGT but lower than that for CAGT-10-AGCG. These results indicate that the upstream AGC acted in an inhibitory manner against the binding of F1 to the downstream AGC (Fig. 5). The differences in the affinities of PF12 toward these probes presenting various arrangements of the F1- and F2-binding sites were due primarily to differences in k off values and not to changes in k on values (Fig. 5). When PF2 was tested for its binding to these probes, only very small differences were observed between all probes. These results indicate that K 2′ but notK 1′ (Scheme 1) was influenced by differences in the arrangement and number of the binding sites. The PF12 binding sequences selected by the SAAB imprinting procedure (Fig. 2 D) suggested that ZPT2–2 has a preference regarding the spacing between the F1- and F2-binding sites, in agreement with our previous observations (8Takatsuji H. Nakamura N. Katsumoto Y. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 947-958PubMed Google Scholar, 14Takatsuji H. Matsumoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23368-23373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To estimate quantitatively the effects of the spacing, SPR assays were completed by using probes with various spacings between the two binding sites. When the F1-binding site was located downstream of the F2-binding site on the same strand, the highest affinity to PF12 was observed for CAGT-10-AGC (K d = 14 ± 1 nm; see Fig. 6 A). Increasing the spacing by 2 bp resulted in a 3.5-fold reduction in the binding affinity, and increasing it by 4 bp led to a 5.4-fold reduction. In comparison, decreasing the spacing by 2 bp reduced the binding affinity by 1.8-fold, and decreasing it by 4 bp reduced the binding affinity by 2.4-fold. The reduction in the affinity was due primarily to the increase in k off rather than to the decrease ink on (Fig. 6 A). When we tested PF2 with the same set of probes, differences in the spacing barely affected the affinity (Fig. 6 A), which indicates that the spacing does not influenceK 1′ (Scheme 1) during the interaction between ZPT2–2 and DNA. Therefore, the effect of spacing on the overall binding affinity of ZPT2–2 (K net) is because of the differences in the K 2s. These results indicate that the effects of spacing become manifest only upon the second interaction, that is, upon the binding of F1 to the AGC site after the initial binding of F2 to the CAGT site. We then assessed the effects of spacing for other arrangements of the core sites. In the AGC-n-CAGT arrangement, the binding affinity was again sensitive to the spacing, with the highest affinity being for AGC-5-CAGT (K d = 25 ± 3 nm; see Fig. 6 B). The effects of spacing on the binding affinity were again due primarily to effects on k offrather than on k on, and the binding of F2 was not affected by the spacing (K d = 20 to 40 μm; see Fig. 6, A and B). Therefore, these results indicate that spacing affectsK 2′ but not K 1′. In light of the DNA binding specificity of ZPT2–2, we searched for ZPT2–2-binding sites in the upstream region of the ZPT2–2 gene. This action revealed a sequence,CAGTCGTAGCCAAAAGCT (PROM; core sites underlined), 320 bp upstream from a transcription initiation site ofZPT2–2. The PROM sequence contains optimal binding sites for the two zinc fingers with optimal spacing. An SPR assay revealed that PF12 bound to PROM with high affinity (K d = 9.5 ± 1.2 nm; see Fig. 5). This result strongly suggests that this sequence is a cognate binding site for ZPT2–2 and presumably serves as a cis-element for the autoregulation of the ZPT2–2 gene itself. In light of our present and previous characterization of the DNA interaction, we here propose a model for the DNA binding of ZPT2–2. ZPT2–2 can interact with two types of DNA sequences, which have different arrangements of the two core sites. The interaction of the F2 zinc finger with the CAGT site primarily initiates the binding. Then the F1 region interacts with an AGC(T) site that is located several nucleotides either upstream or downstream from the CAGT site, thereby stabilizing the complex. The equilibrium between the intermediate and final complexes greatly depends on the spacing between the CAGT and AGC(T) sites; this spacing determines the overall binding affinity. The unique manner in which ZPT2–2 interacts with DNA is due largely to the flexibility of the long linker region between the two zinc fingers. Most transcription factors, including cluster-type zinc finger proteins, interact with continuous DNA sequences. However, some DNA-binding proteins, such as those belonging to the Oct-1 (17Klemm J.D.

These DNA binding proteins have very strict specificities for the spacing between core sequences, to the degree that even a 1-bp deviation in spacing drastically reduces the DNA binding affinity of Oct-1 (18van Leeuwen H.C. Strating M.J. Rensen M. de Laat W. van der Vliet P.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2043-2053Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and PUT3 (a Zn2Cys6 protein; see Ref. 21Swaminathan K. Flynn P. Reece R.J. Marmorstein R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 751-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Compared with those of Oct-1 and PUT3, the specificity of ZPT2–2 for spacing is moderate. In addition, ZPT2–2 will bind to two completely different arrangements of the two DNA-binding sites. Thus, the mechanism by which ZPT2–2 recognizes these noncontiguous binding sites differs from that of Oct-1 and PUT3. Is there any biological advantage to interacting with target DNA sequences in two different arrangements? At present, we have no answer to this question. However, it would be interesting if, depending on various conditions, intact ZPT2–2 could change its conformation between the conformations corresponding to the two arrangements of the two core sites. Because of steric hindrance, the intact ZPT2–2 may not be able to change its conformation as freely as does its truncated form. Even so, the conformation of intact ZPT2–2 may change depending on its state of protein modification or interaction with other regulatory proteins. Thus, ZPT2–2 could switch from one set of target genes to another in response to environmental or intracellular stimuli. In the promoter region of the ZPT2–2 gene, we found a putative ZPT2–2-interacting site that is perfectly in accord with the results of our current in vitro study. Many transcription factors are known to regulate the transcription of their own genes through interacting with their promoter DNA sequences (autoregulation). Considering the ubiquity of autoregulation of transcription factors, together with the high affinity interaction of ZPT2–2 with DNA, the sequence we identified most likely serves as a bona fide cis-element for ZPT2–2 in vivo. Therefore, knowledge of the DNA binding specificity of ZPT2–2 in vitroled us to identifying an in vivo ZPT2–2 interaction site. We expect that this information will facilitate our in vivofunctional characterization of ZPT2–2 in the stress response in plants. We thank Dr. Sanjay Kapoor for critically reading the manuscript."

To elucidate the regulation mechanism of endogenous TGF-β on hepatoma progression, we modified the MH129F mouse hepatoma cell with a retroviral vector encoding the extracellular region of type II TGF-β receptor (TRII). Soluble TRII (TRIIs) blocked TGF-β binding to TRII on the membrane of hepatoma cells. Growth of MH129F cells was inhibited by TGF-β1 treatment; however, soluble TRII-overexpressing cells (MH129F/TRIIs) did not show any change in proliferation after TGF-β1 treatment. MH129F/TRIIs cells also increased vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression, endothelial cell migration, and tube formation. Implantation of MH129F/TRIIs cells into C3H/He mice showed the significantly enhanced tumor formation. According to Western blot and protein kinase C assay, the expression of VEGF, KDR/flk-1 receptor, and endothelial nitric-oxide synthase was enhanced, and the phosphorylation activity of protein kinase C was increased up to 3.7-fold in MH129F/TRIIs tumors. Finally, a PECAM-1-stained intratumoral vessel was shown to be 4.2-fold higher in the MH129F/TRIIs tumor. These results indicate that VEGF expression is up-regulated by a blockade of endogenous TGF-β signaling in TGF-β-sensitive hepatoma cells and then stimulates angiogenesis and tumorigenicity.

Many types of tumor cells secrete TGF-β, which regulates their growth by acting as major autocrine and paracrine modulators (2Sheng H. Shao J. O'Mahony C.A. Lamps L. Albo D. Isakson P.C. Berger D.H.

However, TGF-β exerts diverse biological activities in a wide range of experiments depending on the nature of the cell type and physiological conditions. In vitro, TGF-β acts as a potent growth inhibitor of some cancer cells; at the same time it can act as a selective growth promoter when tumor cells somehow acquire resistance to TGF-β-mediated growth inhibition (3Cui W.

It is assumed that TGF-β may play a paradoxical role in vivo by these different processes. On one hand, TGF-β can stimulate malignant progression, possibly by its action on cell-matrix interaction or by its immunosuppressive activities in vivo (9Torre-Amione G. Beauchamp R.D. Koeppen H. Park B.H. Schreiber H. Moses H.L. Rowley D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1486-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 10Arrick B.A. Lopez A.R. Elfman F. Ebner R. Damsky C.H. Derynck R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 715-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it has been shown that TGF-β can have tumor suppressor activities, most likely because of its growth-inhibitory activities in vivo (11Glick A.B. Lee M.M. Darwiche N. Kulkarni A.B. Karlsson S. Yuspa S.H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2429-2440Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 12Missero C. Ramon Y. Cajal S. Dotto G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4391-4398PubMed Google Scholar) reported that increased TGF-β expression inhibits cell proliferation in vitro yet increases tumorigenicity and tumor growth of Meth A sarcoma cells. Thus, these findings persuade us to investigate the precise and crucial role of TGF-β in tumorigenesis. In evaluating the regulatory function of TGF-β in the angiogenesis mechanism, many studies have reported that TGF-β induces angiogenesis by the production of extracellular matrix and proteolytic enzymes as well as by the expression of adhesion molecules (15Oft M. Peli J. Rudaz C. Schwarz H. Beug H. Reichmann E. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2462-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar, 16Ueki N. Ohkawa T. Yokoyama Y. Maeda J. Kawai Y. Ikeda T. Amuro Y. Hada T.

Cancer. 1997; 70: 612-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Inversely, contradictory reports demonstrate that the local administration of neutralizing anti-TGF-β antibodies has been observed to induce capillary density in tumors (18Arteaga C.L. Coffey Jr, R.J. Dugger T.C. McCutchen C.M. Moses H.L. Lyons R.M. Cell Growth & Differ. 1990; 1: 367-374PubMed Google Scholar). A previous study also indicated that TGF-β down-regulates the expression of flk-1, the tyrosine kinase receptor for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (19Mandriota S.J. Menoud P.A. Pepper M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11500-11505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 20Shen B.Q. Lee D.Y. Gerber H.P. Keyt B.A. Ferrara N. Zioncheck T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29979-29985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). This same study also indicated that the down-regulation of flk-1 expression may be responsible for the inhibitory effect of this cytokine on VEGF-induced in vitro angiogenesis (21Pepper M.S. Vassalli J.D. Orci L. Montesano R. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 204: 356-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). These results imply that TGF-β is a regulator of the angiogenesis mechanism. However, although there are strong evidences to support the role of TGF-β in several aspects of vascular development (9Torre-Amione G. Beauchamp R.D. Koeppen H. Park B.H. Schreiber H. Moses H.L.

Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6076-6080Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), its role and regulation mechanism in angiogenesis is not exactly known. Moreover, because there are no data available on the significance of endogenous TGF-β secreted in tumor cells, we demonstrated how endogenous TGF-β regulates the complex mechanism for determining tumor progression and subsequent tumor angiogenesis. TGF-β conveys signals via two major serine/threonine kinase receptors, type I and type II. The type II TGF-β receptor (TRII) is the primary receptor target for TGF-β (22Lin H.Y. Wang X. Ng-Eaton E. Weinberg R.A. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1992; 68: 775-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar, 23Wieser R. Attisano L. Wrana J.F. Massague J. Mol. Cell.

It is implied that the alteration of TRII expression may potentially contribute to the disruption of the TGF-β signaling pathway. Therefore, to find out what effects would be caused on the tumorigenicity by the loss of endogenous TGF-β actions in TGF-β-sensitive hepatoma cells, we hypothesized that overexpression of the extracellular region of TRII could interrupt the TGF-β-mediated signal pathway by the blockade of TGF-β in tumor progression. In this approach, we used MH129F mouse hepatoma cells secreting a large amount of TGF-β and exerting antiproliferation activity to TGF-β, and then we investigated the new angiogenesis mechanism regulated by TGF-β. In the present study, we demonstrate the new finding that the loss of endogenous TGF-β effects caused by the overexpression of the extracellular region of TRII in hepatoma cells stimulates VEGF expression and then induces angiogenesis. The MFG/TRIIs retroviral vector (25Won J. Kim H. Park E.J. Hong Y. Kim S.J. Yun Y. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1273-1277PubMed Google Scholar) is composed of the extracellular domain (amino acids 1–159) of human TRII (22Lin H.Y. Wang X. Ng-Eaton E. Weinberg R.A. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1992; 68: 775-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar) and was inserted into theNcoI-BamHI site under the control of the LTR. An internal ribosome entry site and neomycin-resistance (neo) genes were used as a backbone (Fig.1A). The genetic modification of MH129F mouse hepatoma cells was performed by a recombinant retrovirus encoding MFG/TRIIs and control MFG/LTR vector. Briefly, each retroviral vector was transfected into the BOSC23 packaging cell line using LipofectAMINE Plus as indicated by the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.). MH129F cells were incubated for 4 h with recombinant viral supernatant containing 8 µg/ml of polybrene (Sigma) and selected after treatment of 800 µg/ml geneticin. To prepare genomic DNA, MH129F, control vector-modified MH129F (MH129F/LTR), and soluble TRII-modified MH129F (MH129F/TRIIs), cells were incubated in digestion buffer (100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 25 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 0.5% SDS, and 0.2 mg/ml proteinase K) at 50 °C overnight. After phenol/chloroform extraction, the supernatants were precipitated with 0.5 volume of 7.5 mammonium acetate and 2 volumes of ethanol. About 100 ng of genomic DNA were used as a template and amplified using specific 5′ and 3′ primers (MFG vector sequence plus human TRIIs sequence) of the extracellular region of human TRII for 25 cycles (1 min, 94 °C; 1 min, 55 °C; 2 min, 72 °C). To determine the expression pattern of soluble TRII in MH129F, MH129F/LTR, and MH129F/TRIIs, the medium was changed to serum-free medium at confluence. Conditioned medium (CM) was collected at 48 h and precipitated with 5 volumes of acetone at −70 °C for 1 h. The pellet was analyzed by Western blot with goat anti-human TRII antibody (R&D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN) and donkey anti-goat horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody as primary and secondary antibodies, respectively. The blot was processed with the chemiluminescence luminol reagents (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) to visualize the immunoreactive bands. Multiple exposures of films were obtained to determine the optimal exposure time. The method for cell and tissue lysis and Western blot has been described previously (26Shen B.Q. Panos R.J. Hansen-Guzman K. Widdicombe J.H. Mrsny R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: L1115-L1120PubMed Google Scholar). The mouse VEGF (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), eNOS (Transduction Laboratories Corp., Lexington, KY), flk-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), and actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) antibodies were used as primary antibodies. CM was prepared in each cell (MH129F, MH129F/LTR, and MH129F/TRIIs) cultured in 1% serum-containing medium for 24 h at confluent conditions. The ELISA plate was coated with 5 µg/ml TGF-β1 and incubated with CM at 37 °C for 1 h. The human biotinylated TRII antibody was used for the detection of soluble TRII, and the absorbency was read at 405 nm on an ELISA reader. To determine the expression of angiogenic factors VEGF and bFGF, mouse VEGF and bFGF antibodies were used for protein detection. The mean value was determined from three independent experiments, and the measurement was performed in quadruplicate for each experiment. MH129F, MH129F/LTR, and MH129F/TRIIs cells were seeded on 24-well plates (104cells/well) and allowed to adhere overnight. After treatment of 5 ng/ml TGF-β1 (R&D Systems Inc.), the cells were harvested at different time points (24, 48, and 72 h) and counted by trypan blue exclusion tests and Coulter Counter (Coulter Corp., Miami, FL). Each experiment was repeated at least four times. The spontaneous formation of capillary-like structures by the mouse endothelial cell MS1 (American Type Culture Collection, CRL-2279) on a basement membrane matrix (Matrigel) was used for the assessment of angiogenic potential. 24-well plates were coated with Matrigel (10 mg/ml), and MS1 cells were seeded on coated plate at 1.5 × 105 cells/well. The CM was supplemented with the agents as indicated, and the cultures were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. CM was collected in MH129F or MH129F/TRIIs cells cultured in serum-free medium at 48 h after confluent culture, and standard culture was exposed to 2% serum-containing medium alone. Tube formation was observed and photographed over the 24-h period using a camera attached to an inverted phase contrast microscope. The degree of tube formation was assessed by counting the number of tubes contained in four random fields from each well. The migration assay used a monolayer denudation assay as described by Tang et al. (27Tang S. Morgan K.G. Parker C. Ware J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28704-28711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Confluent endothelial cells were wounded by scraping with a 2–200-µl pipette tip and denuding a strip of the monolayer 300 µm in diameter. The variation in wound diameter within experiments was ∼5%. Cultures were washed twice with PBS and incubated with the CM supplemented with agents as indicated. The rate of wound closure was observed and photographed over a 24-h period. To confirm endothelial cell migration, polycarbonate filters (8-µm pore size, Corning Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA) coated with type I collagen were used. MH129F or MH129F/TRIIs cells were grown in the outer chamber and at confluence. The inner chamber was transferred to the outer chamber, and MS1 cells were suspended in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium and seeded in the inner chamber. The cell movement was evaluated toward a gradient of CM of mock or TRIIs-overexpressing MH129F cells. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. After the incubation period, nonmigrated cells on the upper surface of the filter were removed, and the cells that had migrated onto the filter were counted manually by examination under microscope. C3H/He mice 4–6 weeks of age were acclimated and caged in groups of six or fewer. MH129F, MH129F/LTR, or MH129F/TRIIs cells (5 × 106) in 100 µl of PBS were injected subcutaneously into the right flanks of the mice, and the animals were examined daily until the tumor became palpable. The mean tumor volume was measured by dial caliper weekly and calculated by the following formula: volume (mm3) = (square root of width × length)3. The experiment was performed four times on six mice in each group, and tumor volumes were measured for 28 days. Tumor tissue was homogenized in a lysis buffer according to a previous study (28Shen B.Q. Lee D.Y. Zioncheck T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33057-33063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) and sonicated three times in ice. The total PKC activity in equal amounts of homogenates was determined by measuring the phosphorylation of C1 peptide (PKC target peptide, PLSRTLSVAAC) provided in the assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI). The homogenate prepared from each tissue (MH129F, MH129F/LTR, and MH129F/TRIIs) was incubated with C1 peptide, 5× reaction buffer (100 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 6.5 mm CaCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm ATP) and PKC activator 5× solution (1 mg/ml phophatidylserine) at 30 °C for 30 min. The C1 peptide conjugated to a fluorescent molecule was phosphorylated by PKC activity and run toward the anode direction during electrophoresis on 0.8% agarose gel (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)). The phosphorylated bands were scanned by a densitometer after electrophoresis, and the relative intensities were quantified using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). At 4 weeks after implantation, the subcutaneous tumors were excised surgically from the mice. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded 4-µm sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated to PBS. Pretreatments included microwave antigen retrieval in a 10 mm citrate buffer for 20 min. Endothelial cells were detected using the endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 PECAM-1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). The immunoperoxidase procedure was conducted as described in the immunocruz staining system, and sections were counterstained with Harris' hematoxylin. Sections labeled with the PECAM-1 antibody were scanned for the localization of vascular hot spots. The 10 most vascular areas were determined and counted for vessel number at high magnification. Stained vessels, which were clearly separated from each other, were counted. For each tumor, at least four independent sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and immunostained for blood vessels. Negative control slides consisted of excluding the primary antibody but retaining all the other steps. First, we examined the TGF-β expression in MH129F mouse hepatoma cells by using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and ELISA techniques. These results showed that MH129F cells expressed at both mRNA and protein levels (data not shown). Most studies involving the inhibition of TGF-β activity have depended on using neutralization antibodies to TGF-β and overexpression of the extracellular domain of TRII (18Arteaga C.L. Coffey Jr, R.J. Dugger T.C. McCutchen C.M. Moses H.L. Lyons R.M. Cell Growth & Differ. 1990; 1: 367-374PubMed Google Scholar, 25Won J. Kim H. Park E.J. Hong Y. Kim S.J. Yun Y. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1273-1277PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we used the approach of inducing expression of soluble TRII in hepatoma cells for binding to TGF-β and blocking its action. The retroviral vectors (29Senger D.R. Galli S.J. Dvorak A.M. Perruzzi C.A. Harvey V.S. Dvorak H.F. Science. 1983; 219: 983-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (3388) Google Scholar) encoding the extracellular domain (amino acids 1–159) of human TRII (MFG/TRIIs, Fig. 1A) and encoding only the neomycin resistance gene (MFG/LTR) were used for genetic modification of MH129F cells (MH129F/TRIIs and MH129F/LTR). To confirm the integration of the retroviral vector into chromosomal DNA, we amplified the fragment of the human soluble TRII region by genomic polymerase chain reaction. MH129F/TRIIs cells had a 0.48-kilobase pair DNA fragment encoding the extracellular domain of TRII in genomic DNA (Fig.1B). Western blot showed the secretion of a 25–35-kDa heterogeneous glycosylated TRIIs into the CM (Fig. 1C). Because the human TRIIs antibody has less than 5% cross-reactivity with the mouse TRII protein, unclear bands were detected in MH129F and MH129F/LTR cells. According to ELISA analysis, the expression level of soluble TRII in MH129F/TRIIs cell was increased up to 22–30-fold compared with MH129F and MH129F/LTR cells (Fig. 1D). Absorbance in MH129F and MH129F/LTR cells did not show any difference with negative control (1% serum-containing medium). In addition, this fact indicates that truncated, soluble TRII retains its binding ability to TGF-β ligands. Therefore, soluble TRII has the capability of competing against a membrane-bound receptor and then to block the various actions of TGF-β. To test the sensitivity of MH129F and MH129F/TRIIs cells to TGF-β1, we determined the effect of TGF-β1 on cell proliferation. TGF-β1 markedly inhibited MH129F cell growth in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). However, soluble TRII-overexpressing MH129F cells did not induce the growth inhibition after TGF-β1 treatment (Fig. 2B). To compare with the characteristics of MH129F and MH129F/TRIIs cells at the molecular level, the expression of angiogenic factors such as VEGF and bFGF was measured by immunoblotting and ELISA analysis. Using Western blot analysis, the elevation of VEGF protein level was observed in MH129F/TRIIs cells compared with MH129F cells (Fig.3A). Also, VEGF secretion in MH129F/TRIIs cells increased by 6-fold compared with control cells (Fig. 3B). In contrast, we were unable to detect the change of bFGF expression in the MH129F/TRIIs cells (Fig. 3).Figure 3The pattern of VEGF expression in MH129F/TRIIs cells.A, the Western blot pattern of protein extracted in MH129F, MH129F/LTR, or MH129F/TRIIs cells: the expression of VEGF (38 kDa, top), basic FGF (40 kDa,middle), and internal control, Actin (43 kDa,bottom), was detected by Western blot analysis.B, the secretion of VEGF by ELISA: The ELISA plate was coated with 10 µg/ml mouse VEGF antibody.

Therefore, we performed the three-dimensional in vitro angiogenesis system, tube formation, on Matrigel. MS1 mouse endothelial cells were suspended on a Matrigel plate and incubated with various media for 24 h (Fig.4). MS1 cells exposed the standard medium with 2% serum forming a tubular network as positive control (Fig.4A), but the CM of MH129F inhibited the tube formation of MS1 cells (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, the addition of CM of MH129F/TRIIs cells formed a long cytoplasmic process and an extensive tubular network (Fig. 4C). To determine whether this potent tube formation was induced by evaluation of VEGF expression in MH129F/TRIIs cells (Fig. 3), we added the specific antibody, which prevented effects of VEGF in CM of MH129F/TRIIs. VEGF blockade in CM of MH129F/TRIIs by specific antibody inhibited tube formation (Fig.4D), but the addition of bFGF antibody did not influence tube formation (Fig. 4E). Thus, these results indicate that induction of VEGF expression in MH129F/TRIIs cells enhances tube formation. Tube formation in three-dimensional cultures depends on the migration of cells after plating (34Ashton A.W. Yokota R. John G. Zhao S. Suadicani S.O. Spray D.C. Ware J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35562-35570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). To assess the impact of MH129F/TRIIs CM on endothelial cell migration, a denudation injury model was studied, and polycarbonated filters coated with type I collagen were used to confirm the endothelial cell migration. Confluent scrape-wounded endothelial cell monolayers were incubated with various media, and the rate of closure was observed over the following 24 h (Fig.5). MS1 cells exposed the standard medium with 2% serum migrated into the denuded area (Fig. 5A), but the CM of MH129F inhibited the migration of MS1 cells into the wounded area (Fig. 5B). Also the CM of MH129F/TRIIs cells significantly enhanced migration of endothelial cells (Fig.5C). VEGF blockade by the specific antibody inhibited endothelial cell migration into the wounded area (Fig. 5D), but addition of the bFGF antibody did not affect the migration ability of MH129F/TRIIs CM (Fig. 5E). Thus, we found that VEGF induction in MH129F/TRIIs cells also might enhance the endothelial cell migration. To investigate the role of endogenous TGF-β in tumor progression, we inhibited the action of endogenous TGF-β by the expression of the extracellular region of TRII in tumor cells and evaluated the consequences on tumor progression in vivo. 5 × 106 cells (MH129F, MH129F/LTR, or MH129F/TRIIs) were injected subcutaneously into the right flank of the syngeneic C3H/He mouse. When the tumor burden was measured at day 28, MH129F and MH129F/LTR cells produced tumors of 4,404 ± 712 and 4,652 ± 1,551 mm3, respectively, whereas MH129F/TRIIs cells had produced markedly large tumors of 22,976 ± 3,381 mm3in volume (Fig. 6A). We also showed the enhancement of vessel formation at 28 days after mouse implantation (Fig. 6B). The result of this animal experiment reveals that the expression of soluble TRII augments in vivotumor growth of TGF-β-sensitive hepatoma cells. In Fig. 6, we found that the tumor progression was proceeded rapidly in mice bearing MH129F/TRIIs by the loss of TGF-β effects. Tumor angiogenesis is permissive for tumor growth by the newly formed vessels and is regulated by a balance between positive and negative regulators. One of the elements likely to play a key role in this equilibrium is the regulation of expression of endothelial cell tyrosine kinase receptors (35Pepper M.S. Mandriota S.J. Vassalli J.D. Orci L.

Therefore, we hypothesized that the induction of tumorigenicity by the loss of endogenous TGF-β action might be mediated by VEGF/flk-1-induced signaling pathway.

The present work compares cardiac tropomyosin and the two tropomyosins from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, TPM1 and TPM2, that are much shorter than vertebrate tropomyosins.

In particular, tropomyosins have complex and incompletely understood effects on actin-myosin interactions.

Cell. 1989; 57: 233-242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The 199-residue TPM1 is the predominant isoform by expression level, and it spans five actin monomers. TPM2 is 161 residues and spans four actin monomers, whereas vertebrate tropomyosins span either six or seven actin monomers. Like other tropomyosins, TPM1 and TPM2 have the classical heptad repeat that is responsible for coiled-coil formation, in which hydrophobic residues are found in the first and fourth positions of successive groups of seven amino acids. Below we show that, unlike other tropomyosins, this motif is interrupted once (TPM2) or twice (TPM1) in the amino acid sequence; the phase of the heptad pattern shifts, due to four residue deletions. Both the short length and the interrupted heptad pattern of yeast tropomyosins suggest they could significantly differ from vertebrate tropomyosins functionally. In the present report we describe the solution properties of TPM1 and TPM2, in comparison to each other and to muscle tropomyosin. The results indicate that yeast and vertebrate tropomyosins act in an isoform-specific manner to modulate myosin binding to actin, in vitro motility, cooperative interactions between myosin and tropomyosin, and the distribution of thin filament conformational states.DISCUSSIONGenetic experiments in S. cerevisiae imply different functions for TPM1 and TPM2. Deletion of the predominant isoform, TPM1, impairs growth rate and vesicular traffic to the cell surface, and these defects are not corrected by overexpression of TPM2. Also, overexpression of TPM2 but not TPM1 changes budding morphology (9Drees B. Brown C. Barrell B.G. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). We now report biochemical observations that potentially explain thesein vivo observations, i.e. isoform-specific effects of yeast tropomyosins on binding of myosin to actin. Under cellular conditions where myosin number is limiting and few cross-bridges are bound, Figs. 4 and 5 suggest that TPM1-containing filaments would be more resistant to movement and to cross-bridge attachment than TPM2-containing filaments. More generally, both experiments show that myosin-thin filament interactions depend quantitatively on tropomyosin isoforms. In normal cells, individual actin filaments can be expected to contain a mixture of isoforms in amounts reflecting their relative concentrations (Fig. 2 and Ref. 9Drees B. Brown C. Barrell B.G. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). It is unknown whether these relative amounts vary depending upon environment, cell cycle, and/or subcellular location. Under conditions where myosin is limiting, the amount of TPM2 could be important for cooperative induction of movement or force.The equilibrium constants summarized in Table II make it possible to comment on how myosin binding to the thin filament is related both to the unusual structural features of yeast tropomyosins and to the specific difference between TPM1 and TPM2. First, the extra stammer in TPM1 is expected to produce more flexibility than for TPM2, and this in principle might have decreased the cooperativity of myosin-thin filament binding. Instead, myosin binding was more cooperative to filaments containing TPM1 than to those with TPM2. Furthermore, back and forth shifts in the actin position of the TPM1 strand were unfavorable (Y ≫ 1), despite the two stammers in each TPM1. These results suggest that the intrinsic stiffness of tropomyosin is not the only property governing the cooperativity of the shifts in its position on the actin surface. As an additional mechanism, we suggest that cooperativity of tropomyosin shifts (and therefore cooperativity of myosin-thin filament binding) is due to localized energy minima for tropomyosin position on actin (the M-, C-, and B-state positions) (6Lehman W. Hatch V. Korman V.L. Rosol M. Thomas L.T. Maytum R. Geeves M.A. Van Eyk J.E. Tobacman L.S. Craig R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 593-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 8Vibert P. Craig R. Lehman W. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), with an energetic penalty (equalingRT lnY 1/2) for each site along the actin filament where the tropomyosin strand crosses from one minimum to another.The 100- to 10,000-fold effect of myosin on vertebrate tropomyosin-actin binding implies either direct contacts between the two proteins or else an indirect interaction mediated by a mutually promoted change in actin. Experiments using tropomyosin mutants in which this process is greatly suppressed suggest (5Tobacman L.S. Butters C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27587-27593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) that the interaction is in fact indirect, because the mutations did not simply weaken myosin-thin filament binding as would have been expected if direct interactions were eliminated. Instead, myosin-thin filament binding exhibited exaggerated cooperativity, as is characteristic of a switch in quaternary structure. Therefore, to explain how tropomyosin and myosin promote each other's binding to actin, it was proposed that the changes in actin that accompany myosin binding (47Kouyama T. Mihashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 114: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 48Feng L. Kim E. Lee W.-L. Miller C.J. Kuang B. Reisler E. Rubenstein P. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14860-14867Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) result in a strengthening of the association of tropomyosin with the actin inner domain (5Tobacman L.S. Butters C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27587-27593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Correspondingly, when tropomyosin is bound to the actin inner domain, it was proposed to promote some of the same changes in actin, thereby increasing the fraction of actin monomers in the M-state (schematically indicated by stripes in Fig. 6).The current results suggest that a major difference between muscle tropomyosin and the yeast isoforms is in the equilibrium constant for actin to convert to the M-state once the tropomyosin is located on the actin inner domain. Schematically, this is the process in Fig. 6 that has an equilibrium value indicated by the product KT× L. (See also Table II, column Equilibrium toward M-state actin.) The equilibrium for conversion to the M-state is biased toward formation for muscle tropomyosin, because KT ×L = 6 ± 3, i.e. > 1, but is less than 1 and biased against M-state formation for TPM1 and TPM2 (KT × L = 0.63 ± 0.06 and 0.32 ± 0.15, respectively), and even further against M-state formation for actin alone: KT0 = 0.17 (from Ref. 5Tobacman L.S. Butters C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27587-27593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Describing these measurements another way, myosin alters actin when it binds, and vertebrate tropomyosins interact with the actin inner domain so as to assist this process. Yeast tropomyosins interact more weakly with the actin inner domain and so provide less assistance to myosin binding.Since the N- and C-terminal regions of TPM1 are homologous to those of TPM2, the functional differences between the two proteins are most likely due to the extra duplicated region present within TPM1. From Fig. 5 and Table II, inclusion of this region significantly alters the equilibria among the various thin filament states. The effects of the duplicated region on L (increased), KT(unchanged), and KT × L (increased) can be explained if the extra region either selectively destabilizes tropomyosin binding to the inner domain of non-M-state actin (i.e. destabilizes tropomyosin binding to the intermediate state in Fig. 6) or else selectively strengthens formation of both the C-state and the M-state. The former explanation is more likely, because it is simpler and also because the latter explanation conflicts with the absence of an effect of myosin S1 on the TPM1 versusTPM2 competition data in Fig. 2. In either case, the result would be a tendency for TPM1 to move away from the inner domain position, producing cooperative myosin binding to the thin filament.Further experiments will be required to determine whether the effects of tropomyosin depend not only on tropomyosin isoform but also on actin and/or myosin isoform. However, the strong myosin-tropomyosin interaction observed with muscle tropomyosin does not seem to depend upon the use of muscle actin, since myosin-decorated yeast actin binds to muscle tropomyosin with very high affinity (37Korman V.L. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22191-22196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 38Korman V.L. Hatch V. Dixon K. Craig R. Lehman W. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22470-22478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Also preliminary experiments (not shown) suggest little difference in TPM2 binding to muscle versus yeast actin. Finally, the myosin isoform may not make much difference either, since even weak myosin binding to actin strengthens tropomyosin attachment to the actin inner domain (25Rosol M. Lehman W. Craig R. Landis C. Butters C. Tobacman L.S. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 908-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).The Fig. 6 model characterizes the effects of tropomyosins on equilibrium actin-myosin binding, rather than the effects of tropomyosins on thin filament sliding. Nevertheless, the model is qualitatively consistent with the in vitro motility data. The myosin concentration requirement for filament sliding was increased by each of the tropomyosins, was increased more by TPM1 than by TPM2, and was particularly increased by cardiac tropomyosin. Each of these observations is consistent with the steric blocking effect that is part of the model, an effect that may be greater for cardiac tropomyosin because it is located on the actin outer domain (the B-state (6Lehman W. Hatch V. Korman V.L. Rosol M. Thomas L.T. Maytum R. Geeves M.A. Van Eyk J.E. Tobacman L.S. Craig R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 593-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar)). Steric blocking is greater for TPM1 than for TPM2 for a different reason, because its movement to the M-state position is more unfavorable (L is greater). On the other hand, it is difficult to relate the model to the effects of tropomyosins on maximal sliding speed, in part because determining the maximum speeds would require higher myosin concentrations than were tested. More significantly, conclusions are difficult because even at maximal speed the densities of myosin attachment are unknown, as are the distributions of thin filament states (C-, M-, etc.) for any of the sliding filament types. However, the model does suggest qualitatively how tropomyosin might affect the maximal speed. Once tropomyosin is bound to the actin inner domain, it affects actin in a manner that affects myosin. Strong myosin binding is tighter (Fig. 5). Also, the apparently faster maximal sliding (Fig. 4) implies that detachment of cycling cross-bridges is faster in the presence of tropomyosin, perhaps by an acceleration of the rate of ADP release from acto-myosin.In summary TPM1, TPM2, and cardiac tropomyosin differ not only in length but also in continuity of the coiled-coil motif. They modulate myosin binding to actin both in the presence and absence of ATP, and each isoform has distinct effects. Their different properties can be explained by a model that combines both steric effects of tropomyosin on myosin binding to actin and also indirect interactions between tropomyosin and myosin, mediated by mutually produced changes in actin. The distinguishable effects of each tropomyosin on the behavior of myosin suggest a biochemical rationale for the existence of tropomyosin isoforms in non-muscle cells. Tropomyosin is a highly elongated coiled-coil protein that binds to actin filaments in both muscle and non-muscle cells. Tropomyosin, which has many isoforms, stabilizes actin filaments against fragmentation, and by its presence on the thin filament has the potential to influence many aspects of F-actin function.

Experiments using tropomyosin mutants in which this process is greatly suppressed suggest (5Tobacman L.S. Butters C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27587-27593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) that the interaction is in fact indirect, because the mutations did not simply weaken myosin-thin filament binding as would have been expected if direct interactions were eliminated. Instead, myosin-thin filament binding exhibited exaggerated cooperativity, as is characteristic of a switch in quaternary structure. Therefore, to explain how tropomyosin and myosin promote each other's binding to actin, it was proposed that the changes in actin that accompany myosin binding (47Kouyama T. Mihashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 114: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 48Feng L. Kim E. Lee W.-L. Miller C.J. Kuang B. Reisler E. Rubenstein P. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14860-14867Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) result in a strengthening of the association of tropomyosin with the actin inner domain (5Tobacman L.S. Butters C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27587-27593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Correspondingly, when tropomyosin is bound to the actin inner domain, it was proposed to promote some of the same changes in actin, thereby increasing the fraction of actin monomers in the M-state (schematically indicated by stripes in Fig. 6).The current results suggest that a major difference between muscle tropomyosin and the yeast isoforms is in the equilibrium constant for actin to convert to the M-state once the tropomyosin is located on the actin inner domain. Schematically, this is the process in Fig. 6 that has an equilibrium value indicated by the product KT× L. (See also Table II, column Equilibrium toward M-state actin.) The equilibrium for conversion to the M-state is biased toward formation for muscle tropomyosin, because KT ×L = 6 ± 3, i.e. > 1, but is less than 1 and biased against M-state formation for TPM1 and TPM2 (KT × L = 0.63 ± 0.06 and 0.32 ± 0.15, respectively), and even further against M-state formation for actin alone: KT0 = 0.17 (from Ref. 5Tobacman L.S. Butters C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27587-27593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Describing these measurements another way, myosin alters actin when it binds, and vertebrate tropomyosins interact with the actin inner domain so as to assist this process. Yeast tropomyosins interact more weakly with the actin inner domain and so provide less assistance to myosin binding.Since the N- and C-terminal regions of TPM1 are homologous to those of TPM2, the functional differences between the two proteins are most likely due to the extra duplicated region present within TPM1. From Fig. 5 and Table II, inclusion of this region significantly alters the equilibria among the various thin filament states. The effects of the duplicated region on L (increased), KT(unchanged), and KT × L (increased) can be explained if the extra region either selectively destabilizes tropomyosin binding to the inner domain of non-M-state actin (i.e. destabilizes tropomyosin binding to the intermediate state in Fig. 6) or else selectively strengthens formation of both the C-state and the M-state. The former explanation is more likely, because it is simpler and also because the latter explanation conflicts with the absence of an effect of myosin S1 on the TPM1 versusTPM2 competition data in Fig. 2. In either case, the result would be a tendency for TPM1 to move away from the inner domain position, producing cooperative myosin binding to the thin filament.Further experiments will be required to determine whether the effects of tropomyosin depend not only on tropomyosin isoform but also on actin and/or myosin isoform. However, the strong myosin-tropomyosin interaction observed with muscle tropomyosin does not seem to depend upon the use of muscle actin, since myosin-decorated yeast actin binds to muscle tropomyosin with very high affinity (37Korman V.L. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22191-22196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 38Korman V.L. Hatch V. Dixon K. Craig R. Lehman W. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22470-22478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Also preliminary experiments (not shown) suggest little difference in TPM2 binding to muscle versus yeast actin. Finally, the myosin isoform may not make much difference either, since even weak myosin binding to actin strengthens tropomyosin attachment to the actin inner domain (25Rosol M. Lehman W. Craig R. Landis C. Butters C. Tobacman L.S. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 908-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).The Fig. 6 model characterizes the effects of tropomyosins on equilibrium actin-myosin binding, rather than the effects of tropomyosins on thin filament sliding. Nevertheless, the model is qualitatively consistent with the in vitro motility data. The myosin concentration requirement for filament sliding was increased by each of the tropomyosins, was increased more by TPM1 than by TPM2, and was particularly increased by cardiac tropomyosin. Each of these observations is consistent with the steric blocking effect that is part of the model, an effect that may be greater for cardiac tropomyosin because it is located on the actin outer domain (the B-state (6Lehman W. Hatch V. Korman V.L. Rosol M. Thomas L.T. Maytum R. Geeves M.A. Van Eyk J.E. Tobacman L.S. Craig R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 593-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar)). Steric blocking is greater for TPM1 than for TPM2 for a different reason, because its movement to the M-state position is more unfavorable (L is greater). On the other hand, it is difficult to relate the model to the effects of tropomyosins on maximal sliding speed, in part because determining the maximum speeds would require higher myosin concentrations than were tested. More significantly, conclusions are difficult because even at maximal speed the densities of myosin attachment are unknown, as are the distributions of thin filament states (C-, M-, etc.) for any of the sliding filament types. However, the model does suggest qualitatively how tropomyosin might affect the maximal speed. Once tropomyosin is bound to the actin inner domain, it affects actin in a manner that affects myosin. Strong myosin binding is tighter (Fig. 5). Also, the apparently faster maximal sliding (Fig. 4) implies that detachment of cycling cross-bridges is faster in the presence of tropomyosin, perhaps by an acceleration of the rate of ADP release from acto-myosin.In summary TPM1, TPM2, and cardiac tropomyosin differ not only in length but also in continuity of the coiled-coil motif. They modulate myosin binding to actin both in the presence and absence of ATP, and each isoform has distinct effects. Their different properties can be explained by a model that combines both steric effects of tropomyosin on myosin binding to actin and also indirect interactions between tropomyosin and myosin, mediated by mutually produced changes in actin. The distinguishable effects of each tropomyosin on the behavior of myosin suggest a biochemical rationale for the existence of tropomyosin isoforms in non-muscle cells. Genetic experiments in S. cerevisiae imply different functions for TPM1 and TPM2. Deletion of the predominant isoform, TPM1, impairs growth rate and vesicular traffic to the cell surface, and these defects are not corrected by overexpression of TPM2. Also, overexpression of TPM2 but not TPM1 changes budding morphology (9Drees B. Brown C. Barrell B.G. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). We now report biochemical observations that potentially explain thesein vivo observations, i.e. isoform-specific effects of yeast tropomyosins on binding of myosin to actin. Under cellular conditions where myosin number is limiting and few cross-bridges are bound, Figs. 4 and 5 suggest that TPM1-containing filaments would be more resistant to movement and to cross-bridge attachment than TPM2-containing filaments. More generally, both experiments show that myosin-thin filament interactions depend quantitatively on tropomyosin isoforms. In normal cells, individual actin filaments can be expected to contain a mixture of isoforms in amounts reflecting their relative concentrations (Fig. 2 and Ref. 9Drees B. Brown C. Barrell B.G. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). It is unknown whether these relative amounts vary depending upon environment, cell cycle, and/or subcellular location. Under conditions where myosin is limiting, the amount of TPM2 could be important for cooperative induction of movement or force. The equilibrium constants summarized in Table II make it possible to comment on how myosin binding to the thin filament is related both to the unusual structural features of yeast tropomyosins and to the specific difference between TPM1 and TPM2. First, the extra stammer in TPM1 is expected to produce more flexibility than for TPM2, and this in principle might have decreased the cooperativity of myosin-thin filament binding. Instead, myosin binding was more cooperative to filaments containing TPM1 than to those with TPM2. Furthermore, back and forth shifts in the actin position of the TPM1 strand were unfavorable (Y ≫ 1), despite the two stammers in each TPM1. These results suggest that the intrinsic stiffness of tropomyosin is not the only property governing the cooperativity of the shifts in its position on the actin surface. As an additional mechanism, we suggest that cooperativity of tropomyosin shifts (and therefore cooperativity of myosin-thin filament binding) is due to localized energy minima for tropomyosin position on actin (the M-, C-, and B-state positions) (6Lehman W. Hatch V. Korman V.L. Rosol M. Thomas L.T. Maytum R. Geeves M.A. Van Eyk J.E. Tobacman L.S. Craig R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 593-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 8Vibert P. Craig R.

During this growth lag period called the acclimation phase, the synthesis of most cellular proteins is sharply reduced, whereas a specific set of proteins termed “cold shock proteins” are induced (1Jones P.G.

Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 279-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and its close homologues CspB, CspG, and CspI are also cold shock-induced to lesser extents (8Etchegaray J.P. Jones P.G.

It has been proposed to function as an RNA chaperone to facilitate translation or transcription antitermination at low temperature (14Jiang W. Hou Y. Inouye M. J. Biol.

Microbiol. 2001; 40: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the cspA promoter is highly active at low temperature, even stronger than the lpp promoter, which is considered to be one of the strongest promoters in E. coli (16Fang L. Jiang W. Bae W. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 355-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 17Nakamura K. Inouye M. Cell. 1979; 18: 1109-1117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). An AT-rich up-element immediately upstream of the −35 region has been implicated to contribute to the strength of thecspA promoter (18Mitta M. Fang L. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 321-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The cspA promoter activity has also been shown to be modestly activated after cold shock (19Goldenberg D. Azar I. Oppenheim A.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 20Goldenberg D. Azar I. Oppenheim A.B. Brandi A. Pon C.L. Gualerzi C.O. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 256: 282-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). At the second level, the cspA mRNA is stabilized by more than a hundred fold by a temperature downshift from 37 °C to 15 °C (16Fang L. Jiang W. Bae W. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 355-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 19Goldenberg D. Azar I. Oppenheim A.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In addition to the dramatic induction of the cspA mRNA amount upon cold shock, the mRNA is highly translatable at low temperature, whereas the translation of mRNAs for non-cold shock proteins is severely hampered in the acclimation phase. The exact mechanisms for the extraordinarily high translatability of thecspA mRNA have not yet been fully elucidated. However, in addition to its Shine-Dalgarno sequence, two other regions, the downstream box (DB)1 and the upstream box, have been proposed to play key roles in the translation initiation at low temperature (18Mitta M. Fang L. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 321-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 21Yamanaka K. Mitta M. Inouye M. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6284-6291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These elements may enhance the ribosome recruitment either by directly interacting with the 30 S subunit or by directing a proper folding of the mRNA to optimize its interaction with 30 S ribosome subunits. CspA production is intensely induced immediately after temperature drop, reaching its peak at approximately 1 h after temperature shift to 15 °C (5Goldstein J. Pollitt N.S. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Interestingly, when cell growth resumes after the acclimation phase, concomitantly the rate of CspA synthesis is significantly reduced to a low basal level. CspA has been implicated to be a negative regulator of its own gene expression, because in a strain with a deletion mutation of the cspA coding sequence the amount of the truncated cspA mRNA was much more than that in its parental strain, and the production of such truncatedcspA mRNA was prolonged in the mutant cells (22Bae W. Jones P.G. Inouye M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7081-7088Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Another intriguing observation is that when mutant cspAmRNAs that are unable to produce full-length CspA were overexpressed at low temperature, cell growth was completely inhibited (23Jiang W. Fang L. Inouye M. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 965-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This phenomenon is termed the low temperature-dependent antibiotic effect of truncatedcspA expression (LACE). Here, we show that the LACE caused by nonsense mutations in the cspA gene results from a nearly exclusive trapping of ribosomes by the mutant cspA mRNAs overexpressed at low temperature. Such trapping occurs even with a nonsense mutation at the second codon, indicating that the LACE can occur in the absence of translation elongation. This in turn suggests that translation initiation of the cspA mRNA is highly efficient and is responsible for its outstanding translatability.

A. 1990; 87: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar) containing the intact full-length cspAgene in pUC9 was used as a wild-type control. pA01S, pA03S, pA10S, pA30S, pA03Sm1, pA03Sm2, pA03Sm3, pA10Dm1, pA10Dm2, pA10Dm4, and pA10Dm5 were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis using pJJG02, pA03S, or pA10D, respectively, as templates. Mutagenesis was performed following a polymerase chain reaction-based protocol usingPfu DNA polymerase (QuickChange mutagenesis, Stratagene). pA10D was constructed by two-step polymerase chain reactions followed by cloning of the final product into the SmaI site of pUC19. It has the intact cspA promoter, 5′-UTR, as well as the transcription terminator, and the only mutated regions are shown in Fig. 6 A. The cells were grown in the labeling medium (M9-glucose medium plus 19 amino acids except for methionine at a final concentration of 50 μg/ml each) to an exponential phase and shifted to a 15 °C water bath. 1-ml portions of each culture were labeled with 5 μl of [35S]methionine (EasyTag Express protein labeling mix, 10 μCi/μl; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 5 min at 37 °C or for 15 min at 15 °C. The cells were chased by the addition of nonradioactive methionine to a final concentration of 5 mg/ml for 2 min at 37 °C or 5 min at 15 °C. The cells were washed by 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and then resuspended in 100 μl of SDS-protein sample buffer, boiled, and loaded on a 17.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (10 μl in each lane). RNAs were extracted from cells using the hot phenol method as described (25Sarmientos P. Sylvester J.E. Contente S. Cashel M. Cell. 1983; 32: 1337-1346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The amounts of RNAs were quantified by their optical absorption at 260 nm, and their qualities were verified by agarose gel electrophoresis. Oligonucleotide APE (5′-TTTTACGATACCAGTCAT-3′) that is complementary to the coding sequence of the cspA mRNA was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase and used as a primer. Primer extension reactions were performed for 1 h at 42 °C using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase in the presence of RNase Inhibitor (both from Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Two micrograms of RNA was used for each reaction. Primer extension products were resolved on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 6 m urea. The cells were grown to an exponential phase (A 600 = ∼0.6–0.8) in 100 ml of LB medium and shifted to a 15 °C water bath to start the cold shock treatment. At different time points after cold shock as indicated in the figures, chloramphenicol was added into cell cultures to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml, and 1 min later cells were poured into prechilled centrifuge tubes containing 50 g of ice. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation for 10 min at 4 °C, resuspended in 1 ml of ribosome buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NH4Cl, and 6 mmβ-mercaptolethanol) containing 15 mmMgCl2 and 1 mg/ml lysozyme, and then stored at −80 °C. The Cells were lysed by two rounds of freeze and thaw, and the lysates were then clarified by centrifugation for 15 min at 14,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C. Cell lysates (400 μl each) were layered on 5–40% sucrose gradients made by ribosome buffer containing 10 mm MgCl2, and the gradients were centrifuged in a Beckman SW41 rotor at 35,000 rpm for 2.5 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation the gradients were connected to a fast protein liquid chromatography system, fractionated, and recorded using the same system. Cells harboring pA30S or pUC19 were cold shocked for 4 h and processed for sucrose gradient analysis. After centrifugation the gradient was fractionated into 0.5-ml fractions from which RNAs were obtained by means of phenol chloroform (1:1) extraction and ethanol precipitation. Each RNA preparation (from 0.2 ml of each fraction) was dissolved in 20 μl of water. RNAs (3 μl each) were resolved on 1% agarose gels containing 1.5 m formaldehyde and then blotted onto a nylon membrane. The same blots were probed for cspA and lppmRNA using their coding sequences as probes. To systematically study the LACE in a simplified system, we made point mutations in the cspAcoding sequence at different positions to introduce nonsense mutations at the 2nd, 11th, and 31st codons into the wild-type cspAgene on plasmid pJJG02 (Fig.1 A). Cells harboring pJJG02 and the mutant plasmids were grown to a mid-log phase and subjected to cold shock treatment. As shown in Fig. 1 B, the growth of cells harboring full-length wild-type cspA gene was recovered from an ∼1.5-h lag period in a similar manner as cells containing the vector pUC19 alone. On the other hand, cells harboring the mutant plasmids were unable to resume growth after temperature downshift. These cells were also unable to form colonies at 15 °C or 20 °C (not shown). To see whether the growth inhibition was due to a block in protein synthesis, cells harboring different plasmids were pulse-labeled by [35S]methionine after cold shock. As shown in Fig.1 C, protein synthesis of cells harboring pUC19 and pJJG02 containing the full-length cspA gene was reduced temporarily (at 1 h) after cold shock but soon recovered (at 3 and 6 h). However, there was virtually no protein production in cells harboring any of the mutant plasmids after cold shock. It should be noticed that even the production of cold shock proteins encoded by the chromosome (marked by an arrowhead) was significantly diminished in cells harboring the mutant plasmids. Note that no peptide is produced from pA01S because a nonsense codon exists next to the initiation codon, whereas small peptides consisting of 10 and 30 residues may be produced from pA10S and pA30S. These small peptides could not be seen on the present SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Next we examined the viability of cells after cold shock. Cells harboring pA30S were withdrawn from a culture at different time points after cold shock and plated on agar plates after appropriate dilution. The plates were then incubated at 37 °C overnight, and the resulting colonies were counted. As shown in Fig. 1 D, the LACE caused cell death with a half-life of ∼2 days. The cells lost viability at a faster rate, with a half-life of slightly longer than 1 day, when they were first plated on agar plates and then incubated at 15 °C (Fig.1 D). In both cases colonies formed by viable cells were found to be highly heterogeneous (not shown), suggesting that cellular damages caused by the LACE were not uniform. Given the very small sizes of the peptides produced from the mutant plasmids, it is unlikely that the observed growth inhibition was caused by these gene products. In particular, pA01S having a nonsense codon immediately after the initiation codon is unable to produce any peptide. Therefore, it is assumed that the mutant mRNAs produced from the plasmids are responsible for the inhibition of cell growth. Thus, we next checked the amounts of mRNAs produced from both the wild-type and the mutant plasmids. Total RNAs were extracted from cells at different time points and subjected to primer extension analysis to determine the amounts of the cspAmRNAs. To detect only the transcripts expressed from the plasmids, a cspA deletion strain whose cspA coding sequence was replaced with a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene was used as a host. To avoid detecting the 5′-UTR of the cspA mRNA produced from the chromosomal cspA gene, the primer was designed to anneal to a region within the coding sequence of thecspA mRNA. As shown in Fig. 2, the amount of the wild-type cspA mRNA from pJJG02 was dramatically induced at 30 min after cold shock at 15 °C. Then it was progressively reduced and reached a new low basal level after 3 h at 15 °C. Note that in normal cells the amount of cspAmRNA is higher at 1 h than at 30 min after cold shock (data not shown), thus the reduction of the cspA mRNA production occurred in the present system sooner than that of the production from the chromosomal cspA gene. This is probably due to more rapid accumulation of CspA, a repressor of its own gene expression, from the multicopy intact cspA genes on pJJG02. The amounts of the mutant mRNAs bearing premature termination codons, however, became completely derepressed and remained constant after temperature downshift (Fig. 2). This was likely to result from the inability of cells to produce CspA and the subsequent loss of its autorepression. As mentioned before, the cspAmRNA is considered to be very efficiently translated at low temperature, especially during the acclimation phase when most cellular mRNAs are translationally inactive. To investigate the possibility that the deregulated overexpression of the mutant mRNAs led to the complete cell growth inhibition, we first compared the ribosomal profiles of cold shocked cells harboring the mutant constructs with those harboring the wild-type cspA plasmid (pJJG02) or the vector plasmid (pUC19). At 1 h after temperature downshift, cells containing pUC19 had almost only the 70 S ribosomes with a few small polysome peaks on a sucrose gradient profile (not shown), indicating a block in translation after cold shock stress. On the other hand, cells containing pJJG02 showed a number of distinct polysome peaks (Fig.3 A), presumably as a result of active translation of the cspA mRNA transcribed from the plasmid. Interestingly, in cells harboring pA01S, which contains nocspA open reading frame because of the termination codon immediately after the initiation codon created in pJJG02, no polysomes were formed except for the major peak of the 70 S ribosome and a small peak at the disome position (Fig. 3 B). In cells harboring pA10S, which is able to encode a 10-residue peptide from a 30-basecspA coding sequence, a new major peak was formed at the disome position in addition to the one at the 70 S position (Fig.3 C). Because the coding sequence of pA30S was further extended to 90 bases encoding a 30-residue peptide, yet another new major peak was formed at the trisome position in addition to those at the 70 S monosome and disome positions (Fig. 3 D). It is important to note that the same three-major-peak profile was maintained even after 24 h of cold shock (not shown). Thus, the number of polysome peaks observed is well correlated with the length of thecspA open reading frame retained in the individual mutant plasmid, strongly suggesting that most translating ribosomes in the cells are engaged in interacting with the mutant cspAmRNAs. To prove that most cellular ribosomes are indeed bound to the mutant cspA mRNAs, the association of the mutantcspA mRNAs and the non-cold shock lppmRNA with ribosomes was examined using cells harboring pA30S. The transcript of lpp, the gene coding for a major outer membrane lipoprotein, was chosen to represent non-cold shock mRNAs. This choice was based on the following two reasons: first the gene is well expressed at both 37 °C and 15 °C, and second the mRNA is highly stable (26Hirashima A. Childs G. Inouye M. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 79: 373-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) to withstand lengthy experimental procedures. RNAs were extracted from every fraction of the sucrose gradient and subjected to Northern blotting analysis. In cold shocked cells harboring pA30S, over 90% of the cspA mRNA was found to be associated with ribosomes (Fig.4 A, nearly 94% in this particular experiment shown). Interestingly, when the same blot was probed for the lpp mRNA, the majority of this mRNA was found at the top of the gradient with less than 10% associated with the 70 S, and almost no signal was detected in the polysome fractions (Fig. 4 A). In control cells harboring pUC19, virtually 100% of the lpp mRNA was detected in the fractions corresponding to the 70 S and polysomes (Fig. 4 B). When the same filters were probed for the ompA mRNA, in pUC19 cells the mRNA was readily detected and mostly located in fractions corresponding to polysomes consisting of more than four 70 S units (data not shown), indicating that the mRNA was actively translated, whereas the mRNA was hardly detectable in cells harboring pA30S and absent in the polysome fractions (data not shown). In light of the observation that the amount of lpp mRNA, estimated by the necessary exposure time to achieve approximately equal signal intensity, also appeared to be less than that in control cells, it seems that the exclusion of these mRNAs from ribosomal protection greatly facilitated their degradation. These results demonstrate that the cspA mRNA is highly competitive in translation, effectively excluding the interaction of other cellular mRNAs with ribosomes. Next we attempted to prove that the translation initiation step is crucial for the LACE caused by the mutant cspA mRNAs. For this purpose, mutational analysis was carried out using pA03S containing a nonsense mutation (AAA to TAA) at the fourth codon of the cspA gene in pJJG02 (Fig.5 A). Cells transformed with pA03S were unable to form colonies at low temperature (Fig.5 C), and their growth in a liquid medium was also severely inhibited at low temperature (Fig. 5 D). When either the SD sequence or the AUG initiation codon of pA03S was abolished (pA03Sm1 and pA03Sm2, respectively; Fig. 5 A), cells transformed with these plasmids became capable of forming normal-sized colonies at low temperature (Fig. 5 C). Cells haboring pA03Sm1 grew in liquid LB medium at low temperature as normally as cells harboring pUC19, and those harboring pA03Sm2 also grew normally except for a longer lag period (Fig. 5 D). It is important to note that the two above mutations did not affect the induction of the mRNA after cold shock (Fig. 5 B). These results indicate that the normal ribosome association with mRNAs through the Shine-Dalgarno sequence and the initiation codon is required for the LACE. Interestingly, the cspA mRNA contains a second AUG at the fifth codon, which is completely conserved among cold shock-inducible cspA homologues such as cspB,cspG, and cspI but not present in non-cold shockcspA homologous genes cspC, cspD, andcspE (2Yamanaka K. Fang L. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the possible role of this AUG codon in the LACE by replacing it with a CUG (Leu) codon in pA03S (Fig. 5 A). This mutation failed to rescue the cells from the LACE both on an agar plate and in a liquid medium at low temperature (Fig. 5, C and D, respectively), implying that this codon may not play a role in the translation of thecspA mRNA at low temperature. Again, this mutation did not affect the amount of mRNA induced by cold shock (Fig.5 B). It has been proposed that the cspA mRNA contains a DB, a 15-base sequence downstream of its initiation codon and complementary to a part of the 16 S ribosomal RNA (anti-DB), which functions as a translation enhancer at low temperature (18Mitta M. Fang L. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 321-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). To determine whether the DB is essential for the LACE, we generated a construct that had a deletion of the portion of the cspAcoding sequence downstream of the DB to minimize its potential interference to either RNA structure or stability. Such a construct, pA10D, was made from pA03S by truncating the mutant cspAgene after the DB (Fig. 6 A). The ρ-independent transcription terminator of cspA forming a stem-loop structure followed by a U-rich track (Fig. 6 A) was then connected to the truncation point with three extra U residues. These three bases were added in an attempt to reduce possible steric hindrance to the potential interaction between the DB and the 30 S ribosomal subunit by the sizable stem-loop structure. Cells with pA10D were unable to form colonies (not shown) and could not grow at all in a liquid medium at low temperature (Fig. 6 B). Furthermore, these cells were found to lose viability after cold shock (not shown), similar to cells harboring pA30S. These results suggest that the DB may either indeed enhance the ribosome recruitment to this mRNA or in this situation simply provide enough space required for the ribosome to form the initiation complex with the mRNA. To distinguish the two possibilities and to determine whether the DB of the cspA mRNA is required for LACE, two mutants were constructed base on pA10D in an attempt to minimize the sequence complementarity between the DB region and the anti-DB in the 16 S ribosomal RNA. As shown in Figs. 6 A and 7, the DB of the wild-type cspA mRNA has a potential to form 10–11 base pairs with the anti-DB region in the 16 S ribosomal RNA, whereas such potential in the two mutants was significantly reduced (Fig.7). In fact, all of the frames of the two mutants were searched for alternative base pair matching patterns, but no more than eight matches were found. Cells transformed with pA10Dm1 and pA10Dm2 were still unable to from colonies at low temperature, implying that the proposed DB of the cspA mRNA is not required for the ribosome trapping under the present condition. This result, however, does not exclude the possibility that the DB plays a role in the translation of the intact cspA mRNA under physiological condition. Previously, serial deletion analysis of the unusually long 5′-UTR of the cspA mRNA has identified a 26-base-long sequence, named the “upstream box,” that is essential for the translation of the cspA mRNA (21Yamanaka K. Mitta M. Inouye M. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6284-6291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The central part of this sequence was also found to be complementary to the sequence from bases 1021 to 1035 of the 16 S ribosomal RNA (21Yamanaka K. Mitta M. Inouye M. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6284-6291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The upstream box, located immediately upstream of the Shine-Dalgarno sequence, is proposed to be essential for the mRNA to achieve the proper folding that facilitates ribosome binding. We therefore examined the role of the upstream box in the LACE. Two upstream-box mutants of pA10D, pA10Dm4, and pA10Dm5 were constructed by deleting either the entire 26-base upstream box or its 13-base central region that is complementary to the 16 S ribosomal RNA (Fig. 8 A). Cells transformed with the three plasmids were tested for cold sensitivity both on plates and in a liquid medium. Interestingly, three distinct phenotypes were observed. As mentioned before, cells transformed with pA10D were cold-sensitive both on plates and in a liquid medium, whereas cells with pA10Dm4 were able to form normal sized colonies (not shown) and grow in a liquid medium in an almost identical fashion to cells harboring pUC19. Cells with pA10Dm5, however, showed an intermediate phenotype, forming smaller colonies on plates (not shown) and growing in a liquid medium at a much reduced rate than the control cells (Fig.8 C). These cells were found to contain plasmid-derivedcspA mRNAs at similar levels at 15 °C, suggesting that the deletion of the upstream box abolished the exceptional translatability of the pA10D mRNA; thus the mutant mRNAs lost their ribosome trapping capability. In this study, we demonstrated that overexpression of mutantcspA mRNAs bearing nonsense mutations caused in most cases complete growth inhibition and cell death at low temperature. Consistent with our previous proposal that CspA negatively regulates its own gene expression, the nonsense mutations in cspA that abolished the production of CspA resulted in the derepression of the mutant mRNAs expressed from multi-copy plasmids. Most of these mRNAs were found to be associated with ribosomes in the cells. On the other hand, the lpp mRNA, which under normal conditions was almost exclusively associated with ribosomes, became dissociated under the same condition. These results clearly demonstrate that the LACE is caused by the trapping and sequestration of cellular ribosomes by the mutant cspA mRNAs at low temperature. Eradication of CspA production by the nonsense mutations appears to be the primary cause of the derepression of mutant mRNAs. In addition, the derepression may be enhanced by the insufficient induction of exoribonuclease polynucleotide phosphorylase, a cold shock protein likely to be responsible for clearing cold shock mRNAs at the end of acclimation phase (27Yamanaka K. Inouye M. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 2808-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), in LACE-affected cells. Furthermore, the tight packing of ribosomes may also effectively protect the covered mRNAs from being degraded and thus contribute to the derepression of the mutant mRNAs. Consistent with this notion, it was found that the stability of a certain mRNA studied was correlated with its ability to trap ribosomes. For instance, pA03S mRNA capable of trapping ribosomes was well maintained after cold shock, whereas pA03Sm1 mRNA unable to bind ribosomes was efficiently degraded after the initial induction in the acclimation phase (Fig.5 B). It is known that each ribosome occupies ∼30–35 bases on a mRNA (28Steitz J.A. Nature. 1969; 224: 957-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 29Platt T. Yanofsky C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 2399-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is conceivable that the mRNA from pA10S with a 30-base open reading frame can accommodate at most two ribosomes, one at the initiation codon and the other at the termination codon, whereas the mRNA from pA30S with a 90-base open reading frame can be occupied by three ribosomes. Indeed this notion was confirmed by the analysis of polysome patterns (Fig. 3). Therefore, under the LACE the upper limit of the size of polysomes is determined by the position of a nonsense codon in the cspA gene. The ribosome profiles in Fig. 3 also indicate that the ribosomes are tightly stacked on the available coding regions of the mutantcspA mRNAs. Among the LACE-causing plasmids, pA01S is particularly interesting, because the nonsense codon is placed immediately after the initiation codon in the cspA gene. Cells harboring pA01S contained almost only 70 S ribosomes after cold shock (Fig. 3 B), yet the growth of these cells were completely inhibited (Fig. 1 B), indicating that severe ribosome trapping occurred inside the cells. These results demonstrate that the robust translatability of the cspAmRNA is determined at the step of initiation and further imply that the formation of 70 S initiation complex with fMet-tRNA and pA01S mRNA outpaces the termination process at low temperature. The latter notion is also supported by the tight stacking of ribosomes on pA10S and pA30S mRNA. Considering that chloramphenicol might inhibit translation termination, we performed the polysome isolation without using chloramphenicol, and the result was essentially identical to the one obtained using the drug (data not shown). The slowness of translation termination may be further enhanced under the LACE, because the synthesis of certain factors required for the termination may be blocked in the absence of protein synthesis. The first postulated translational enhancer of cold shock mRNAs has been the DB. β-Galactosidase fusion experiments showed that the proposed DB regions of the cspA and cspBmRNAs were essential for cold shock induction of the fusion proteins (18Mitta M. Fang L. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 321-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 30Etchegaray J.P. Inouye M. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5852-5854Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The initial hypothesis is that the DB promotes 30 S mRNA binding through its base pairing interaction with the anti-DB sequence of 16 S ribosomal RNA located in its penultimate stem (31Sprengart M.L. Fatscher H.P. Fuchs E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1719-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar,32Sprengart M.L. Fuchs E. Porter A.G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 665-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, this model has been vigorously debated in recent years as the anti-DB is localized in the seemingly stable penultimate stem, and no such interaction has been detected (33Resch A. Tedin K. Grundling A. Mundlein A Blasi U. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4740-4748Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 34La Teana A. Brandi A. O'Connor M. Freddi S. Pon C.L. RNA. 2000; 10: 1393-1402Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). An inversion of the anti-DB in the 16 S ribosomal RNA also did not significantly affect the DB-directed translation enhancement (35O'Connor M. Asai T. Squires C.L. Dahlberg A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8973-8978Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Hence, the mechanism of the DB function remains elusive to date even though recent ribosome structures have assigned the anti-DB region exposed on the surface of the 30 S ribosomal subunit facing the 50 S subunit (36Clemons Jr., W.M. May J.L. Wimberly B.T. McCutcheon J.P. Capel M.S. Ramakrishnan V. Nature. 1999; 400: 833-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 37Cate J.H. Yusupov M.M. Yusupova G.Z. Earnest T.N. Noller H.F. Science. 1999; 285: 2095-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar), indicating that the DB of a mRNA could have access to the anti-DB if substantial melting of the helix occurs under certain conditions. Because the functionality of DB-like downstream sequences has been well established (Refs. 32Sprengart M.L. Fuchs E. Porter A.G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 665-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 38Etchegaray J.P. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10079-10085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, and 39Etchegaray J.P. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 438-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar and references therein), alternate working models remain to be explored to reconcile the above discrepancies. In the present study, mutation of the DB failed to rescue the LACE caused by pA10D. This might be caused by the overexpression of the mRNA from multicopy plasmids, because the potential contribution of the DB to the cspA mRNA translation could become dispensable when the mRNA amount reaches above a certain threshold. Therefore, any negative result obtained by the present system should be considered as inconclusive. In the present study, we also demonstrated that in addition to the Shine-Dalgarno sequence and the initiation codon, the upstream box in the unusually long 5′-UTR of the cspA mRNA plays an important role in the formation of the translation initiation complex leading to the LACE. When the upstream box was deleted from pA10D, the resulted pA10Dm4 mRNA totally lost its translatability and failed to trap ribosomes, although the mRNA was constantly present, because cells appeared completely free from growth inhibition (Fig. 8). The role of the upstream box has been speculated to be involved in the mRNA folding to facilitate the ribosome-mRNA interaction (21Yamanaka K. Mitta M. Inouye M. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6284-6291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the present results support this notion. The folding directed by the upstream box or the entire 5′-UTR may not be simply to expose the Shine-Dalgarno sequence and AUG codon to ease the formation of the initiation complex. More likely, it may possess a certain RNA structural feature that could be recognized by either ribosomes or some other factors that facilitate ribosome recruitment. Finally, it is also interesting to point out that the extent of the LACE, as judged by the severity of cell growth inhibition, caused by a certain mRNA seems to be well correlated with the efficiency of translation initiation on that mRNA. For example, cells with pA03Sm1 grew normally at low temperature, whereas cells with pA03Sm2 showed a long lag period before growth resumption (Fig. 5 D). This result is fully consistent with the established principle that the SD plays a more important role in initiating ribosome binding than the AUG codon. Similarly, cells with pA10Dm4 grew faster than cells harboring pA10Dm5 (Fig. 8 C), suggesting that a broader region of the upstream box is required for maximum translatability. Therefore, the present system may be used to further investigate elements in the cspA 5′-UTR that influence the rate and efficiency of translation initiation. The elucidation of the exact mechanisms may provide a new insight into developing a novel method to regulate or to completely block bacterial cell growth. We thank Drs. S. Phadtare and R. Dutta for critical reading of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2098578261,"Hammerhead ribozymes catalyze self-cleavage of oligomeric RNAs generated in replication of certain viroid and viroid-like RNAs. Previous studies have defined a catalytic core conserved in most natural hammerheads, but it is still unknown why some present deviations from the consensus. We have addressed this issue in chrysanthemum chlorotic mottle viroid (CChMVd), whose (+) hammerhead has an extra A (A10) between the conserved A9 and the quasi-conserved G10.1. Effects of insertions at this position on hammerhead kinetics have not hitherto been examined. A10 caused a moderate decrease of thetrans-cleaving rate constant with respect to the CChMVd (+) hammerhead without this residue, whereas A10→C and A10→G substitutions had major detrimental effects, likely because they favor catalytically inactive foldings. By contrast, A10→U substitution induced a 3–4-fold increase of the rate constant, providing an explanation for the extra U10 present in two natural hammerheads. Because A10 also occupies a singular and indispensable position in the global CChMVd conformation, as revealed by bioassays, these results show that some hammerheads deviate from the consensus due to the involvement of certain residues in critical function(s) other than self-cleavage. Incorporation of the extra U10 into a model hammerhead also caused a similar increase in the rate constant, providing data for a deeper understanding of the hammerhead structural requirements and for designing more efficient ribozymes.

By contrast, A10→U substitution induced a 3–4-fold increase of the rate constant, providing an explanation for the extra U10 present in two natural hammerheads. Because A10 also occupies a singular and indispensable position in the global CChMVd conformation, as revealed by bioassays, these results show that some hammerheads deviate from the consensus due to the involvement of certain residues in critical function(s) other than self-cleavage. Incorporation of the extra U10 into a model hammerhead also caused a similar increase in the rate constant, providing data for a deeper understanding of the hammerhead structural requirements and for designing more efficient ribozymes. nucleotide(s) peach latent mosaic viroid chrysanthemum chlorotic mottle viroid satellite RNA of lucerne transient streak virus satellite RNA of Arabis mosaic virus polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis polymerase chain reaction Viroids, subviral circular RNAs of 247–401 nucleotides (nt),1 are the smallest autonomous replicons (1Diener T.O.

This minimal size imposes severe restrictions onto viroid genomes to accommodate a series of functions critical to their life cycle which include host selection, long distance and cell-to-cell movement, and targeting to specific subcellular organelles (nuclei or chloroplasts) where they replicate and accumulate. All these functions must result from the direct interaction of the viroid RNA, or some of its replicative intermediates, with cellular factors because the available evidence indicates that viroids do not code for proteins (3Davies J.W. Kaesberg P. Diener T.O. Virology. 1974; 61: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 4Hall T.C. Wepprich R.K. Davies J.W. Weathers L.G. Semancik J.S.

Nature. 1978; 273: 203-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Genetic information, therefore, must be extremely compressed and even overlapping in viroids. Viroids replicate through a rolling-circle mechanism in which the infecting most abundant monomeric circular RNA, assumed by convention to have the (+) polarity, is successively transcribed into oligomeric (−) and (+) strands that are then excised into the linear monomeric forms and circularized to produce the progeny (6Branch A.D. Robertson H.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 6381-6385Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 7Owens R.A. Diener T.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1978; 75: 896-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and depending on whether or not the (−) oligomeric intermediates are cleaved and ligated to their corresponding monomeric circular counterparts, which then serve as the initial template for the second half of the cycle, the mechanism is considered to be symmetric or asymmetric, respectively (9Branch A.D. Robertson H.D. Science. 1984; 223: 450-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Due to the lack of messenger activity of viroid RNAs, the whole replication process should be in principle catalyzed by host enzymes. However, in avocado sunblotch viroid (10Symons R.H.

Virus Res. 2000; 55: 271-323Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the cleavage step is autocatalytic and mediated by hammerhead structures that can be adopted by the strands of both polarities. Consequently, these three viroids are considered to replicate following the symmetric rolling-circle mechanism. In line with this view, the monomeric (−) circular RNA has been identified in avocado sunblotch viroid-infected avocado (15Hutchins C.J. Keese P. Visvader J.E. Rathjen P.D. McInnes J.L. Symons R.H.

Academic Press, San Diego, CA2000: 1009-1024Google Scholar), are assumed to follow the asymmetric rolling-circle mechanism because the oligomeric forms are the predominant (−) strands accumulating in tissues infected by representative members of this family, whereas the monomeric (−) circular RNA has not been identified (9Branch A.D. Robertson H.D. Science. 1984; 223: 450-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 19Branch A.D. Benenfeld B.J. Robertson H.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cleavage of the oligomeric (+) RNA intermediates in family Pospiviroidae is generally believed to require a host ribonuclease (21Tsagris M. Tabler M. Mühlbach H.P. Sänger H.L. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2173-2183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Baumstark T. Schröder A.R.W. Riesner D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 599-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), although the possibility that the cleavage step is RNA-catalyzed in all cases has been also advanced (23Liu Y.-H. Symons R.H. RNA. 1998; 4: 418-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The hammerhead ribozyme is a small RNA motif able to self-cleave at a specific phosphodiester bond in the presence of a divalent metal ion, generally Mg2+, and under mild temperature and pH conditions, producing 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate and 5′-hydroxyl termini (11Hutchins C.J. Rathjen P.D. Forster A.C. Symons R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 3627-3640Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 24Prody G.A. Bakos J.T. Buzayan J.M. Schneider I.R. Bruening G.

Structural dissection of the 23 natural hammerhead structures reported so far (for a review, see Ref. 26Flores R. Hernández C. De la Peña M. Vera A. Daròs J.A. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 341: 540-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) shows a central core composed of 11 strictly conserved nucleotides flanked by three double-helix regions (I, II, and III) with loose sequence requirements except positions 10.1 and 11.1, which in most cases form a G-C pair, and positions 15.2 and 16.2, which in most cases form a C-G pair (Fig.1 A). Site-directed mutagenesis has revealed that the conserved residues play a critical role in determining the rate constant of cleavage (27Ruffner D.E. Stormo G.D. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10695-10702Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar), and analysis by x-ray crystallography has uncovered a complex array of noncanonical interactions between the residues forming the central core (28Pley H. Flaherty K.M. McKay D.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 68-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar, 29Scott W.G. Finch J.T. Klug A. Cell. 1995; 81: 991-1002Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar), prominent among which are three non-Watson-Crick pairs (involving A9 and G12, G8 and A13, and U7 and A14) that extend helix II (Fig. 1 A). However, deviations from the consensus hammerhead core have been observed in some natural hammerhead structures. This is the case of the CChMVd (+) hammerhead structure, which is peculiar in having an extra A inserted between the strictly conserved A9 and the highly conserved G10.1 residues (13Navarro B. Flores R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11262-11267Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). These two residues are contiguous in all known natural hammerhead structures except in those of (+) strands of satellite RNAs of lucerne transient streak virus (sLTSV) (25Forster A.C. Symons R.H. Cell. 1987; 49: 211-220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar) and Arabis mosaic virus (sArMV) (30Kaper J.M. Tousignant M.E. Steger G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 154: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), in which an extra U exists at the same position (Fig.1 B), and in those of (+) strand of satellite RNA of cereal yellow dwarf virus-RPV (31Miller W.A. Hercus T. Waterhouse P.M. Gerlach W.L. Virology. 1991; 183: 711-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 32Song S.I. Silver S.L. Aulik M.A. Rasochova L. Mohan B.R. Miller W.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 781-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and (−) strand of the carnation small viroid-like RNA (33Hernández C. Daròs J.A. Elena S.F. Moya A. Flores R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 6323-6329Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), in which the extra residue is a C. In the two latter hammerhead structures, the extra C is accompanied by an extra A inserted between the highly conserved C11.1 and the strictly conserved G12 residues. The observation that natural selection has allowed an extra residue between positions A9 and G10.1 in a significant number of natural hammerhead structures is intriguing and raises the question of whether this could provide some adaptive advantage to the corresponding RNAs. A plausible explanation is that the extra residue might be also involved in determining a functional property other than self-cleavage and, on this basis, be preserved. Here we have put this hypothesis to the test using the CChMVd/chrysanthemum system, which is very suitable for this purpose because recombinant plasmids containing dimeric head-to-tail viroid cDNA inserts, or in vitro transcripts thereof, are infectious and incite symptoms in a relatively short time (12–15 days) (13Navarro B. Flores R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11262-11267Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Moreover, although an extra residue between positions 9 and 10.1 is compatible with extensive self-cleavage during in vitro transcription and after purification (13Navarro B. Flores R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11262-11267Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 25Forster A.C. Symons R.H. Cell. 1987; 49: 211-220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, 34Sheldon C.C. Symons R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 5679-5685Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), a kinetic analysis of the effects of mutations in this particular position on the corresponding rate constants of cleavage is lacking, despite the ample biochemical and biophysical analyses to which the hammerhead ribozyme has been subjected (35Stage-Zimmermann T.K. Uhlenbeck O.C. RNA. 1998; 4: 875-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 36Murray J.B. Scott W.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We have addressed this second issue with atrans-acting hammerhead structure derived from the CChMVd (+) RNA and then by extending the analysis to a well known model hammerhead structure. Our results show that the nature of the extra residue between positions A9 and G10.1 has profound effects on viroid infectivity and on hammerhead-mediated RNA cleavage, leading in some cases to a significant increase in the catalytic efficiency of the ribozyme. Circular forms of the CChMVd, purified by two consecutive PAGE steps, were reverse transcribed and PCR-amplified with primers RF-146 (complementary to nt 133–108) and RF-147 (homologous to nt 134–159 of the CM5 reference sequence of CChMVd (Ref. 37De la Peña M. Navarro B. Flores R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9960-9965Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar; see also Fig. 2)). Reverse transcription, PCR amplification, and cloning were performed as described previously (13Navarro B. Flores R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11262-11267Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Inserts were sequenced with an ABI Prism DNA apparatus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The protocol reported previously (38Byrappa S. Gavin D.K. Gupta K.C. PCR Methods Appl. 1995; 5: 404-407Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar) was followed with minor modifications. The recombinant plasmid pCM5 (5 ng), containing a monomeric insert of the CChMVd reference sequence (13Navarro B. Flores R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11262-11267Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), was PCR-amplified with Pfu DNA polymerase and 500 ng each of the phosphorylated primers RF-142 (5′-CATGGATCVTCATCAGGACACACCGAC-3′), complementary to nucleotides 11–35 of the CM5 sequence (except the residue in bold that was degenerated to change the A27, corresponding to A10 in the CChMVd plus hammerhead, into C, G, or U), and RF-134 (5′-ACAGGATCGAAACCTCTTCCAGTT-3′), homologous to nucleotides 36–59 (Fig. 2). Plasmid pCM5 was also PCR-amplified with the phosphorylated primers RF-133 (5′-CATGGATCTCATCAGGACACACCGAC-3′), complementary to nucleotides 11–35 of the CM5 sequence (except in the position corresponding to A27 that was deleted) and RF-134. The PCR products were electrophoretically separated in 1% agarose gels, and those of plasmid length were eluted and circularized with T4 DNA ligase. After transformation, the inserts of the new plasmids, pCM5-C10, pCM5-G10, pCM5-U10, and pCM5-Δ10, were sequenced to confirm that only the expected mutations had been introduced. From these constructs, plasmids pCM5d, pCM5d-C10, pCM5d-G10, pCM5d-U10, and pCM5d-Δ10, containing the corresponding head-to-tail dimeric inserts, were generated following standard protocols. Chrysanthemum (Dendranthema grandiflora Tzvelez, cv. “Bonnie Jean”) was propagated in growth chambers (13Navarro B. Flores R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11262-11267Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Plants were mechanically inoculated either with the recombinant plasmids pCM5d, pCM5d-C10, pCM5d-G10, pCM5d-U10, and pCM5d-Δ10 (2 μg of plasmid/plant) or with their monomeric CChMVd RNAs (0.1 μg of RNA/plant) resulting from self-cleavage during in vitrotranscription. CChMVd replication in the inoculated plants was analyzed by dot-blot hybridization following extraction of leaves with buffer-saturated phenol and chromatography on nonionic cellulose (CF11, Whatman) (37De la Peña M. Navarro B. Flores R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9960-9965Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The recombinant plasmids pCM5, pCM5-C10, pCM5-G10, pCM5-U10, and pCM5-Δ10 were linearized with BamHI and in vitro transcribed with T3 RNA polymerase (39Forster A.C. Davies C. Hutchins C.J. Symons R.H. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 181: 583-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The primary transcripts and their self-cleavage products were separated by PAGE in 5% gels containing 8 m urea and 40% formamide that were quantitatively scanned with a bioimage analyzer (Fuji BAS1500). Ribozymes with the sequence of the CChMVd (+) hammerhead from positions 14 to 53 of the CM5 reference sequence (Fig. 2) and mutants thereof at position 27, which corresponds to position A10 of the hammerhead (Fig. 4), were synthesized by in vitro transcription ofXbaI-linearized plasmids containing these sequences, immediately preceded and followed by the T7 promotor and theXbaI site, respectively. Transcription reactions (50 μl) contained 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 6 mmMgCl2, 2 mm spermine, 10 mmdithiothreitol, 2 mm each of ATP, CTP, GTP and UTP, 2 units/μl human placental ribonuclease inhibitor, 20 ng/μl plasmid DNA, and 4 units/μl T7 RNA polymerase. After incubation at 37 °C for 1 h, transcription products were separated by PAGE in 15% denaturing gels and those with the expected length were eluted, recovered by ethanol precipitation, and resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The model hammerhead ribozyme HH8 (Fig. 6) and its mutants at position 10 of the hammerhead were also prepared by in vitro transcription following the same protocol. Substrate RNAs (5′-AAGAGGUCGGCACC-3′) and (5′-GAAUGUCGGUCG-3′) for the CChMVd (+) and the HH8 hammerheads, respectively (Figs. 4 and 6), were obtained by chemical synthesis using 2′-orthoester protection (Dharmacon Research, Boulder, CO) and sequentially deprotected with 0.2 m acetic acid and Tris-HCl, pH 8.7. After purification by PAGE in 20% denaturing gels, the substrate RNAs were eluted and labeled at their 5′ termini using [α-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, 3000 Ci/mmol) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (40Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar).Figure 6Ribozyme and substrate complexes derived from the HH8 hammerhead structure. Ribozymes and substrates are inblack and gray letters, respectively. Residues conserved in most natural hammerhead structures are on ablack background, and the self-cleavage sites are denoted by arrows. HH8 refers to the consensus hammerhead structure (without a residue at position 10), andHH8-A10, HH8-C10, HH8-G10, andHH8-U10 refer to the mutant forms with an extra A10, C10, G10, and U10 residues (outlined fonts), respectively. The extra A10, C10, and U10 residues could potentially interact with G12, distort the catalytic core, and reduce the corresponding rate constants. In the case of HH8-G10, an alternative catalytically inactive complex is also presented. Other details are as described in the legend to Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Single-turnover experiments with excess ribozyme (covering a range from 100 to 1000 nm in different experiments in order to assure saturating conditions) and trace32P-labeled substrate (less than 1 nm) were used to determine the rate constant of cleavage (41Hertel K.J. Herschlag D. Uhlenbeck O.K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3374-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Cleavage reactions were carried out in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2 at 25 °C as described previously (42Fedor M.J. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12042-12054Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The ribozyme and substrate were first annealed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, by heating at 95 °C for 1 min and slowly cooling down to 25 °C for 15 min. Reactions were initiated by adding MgCl2 to a final concentration of 10 mm. Aliquots were removed at appropriate time intervals and quenched with a 5-fold excess of stop solution (8 m urea, 50% formamide, 50 mm EDTA, 0.1% xylene cyanol, and bromphenol blue dyes) at 0 °C. Substrate and product from each time point were separated by PAGE in 20% denaturing gels. The fraction of product at different times F was determined by radioactivity quantitation of the corresponding gel bands with a bioimage analyzer and fitted to the equation F = F∞ (1 −e −kt), whereF∞ is the fraction of product at the end point of the reaction and k the first order rate constant of cleavage (kcat). In the case of the HH8 hammerhead, cleavage rates were also measured under multiple-turnover conditions (43Fedor M.J. Uhlenbeck O.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1668-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) using at least six different substrate concentrations, ranging from 50 to 1000 nm, in excess over those of the ribozyme (from 10 to 40 nm depending on the catalytic activity of the ribozyme). Reactions were initiated by mixing at 25 °C the ribozyme (15 μl) and the substrate (15 μl) previously heated at 95 °C for 1 min in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 10 mm MgCl2. Aliquots were removed as before, and data were fitted to Eadie-Hofstee plots to obtain the values for kcat and Km. The errors reported for kinetic parameters were obtained from triplicate experiments with different preparations of RNA. Hereafter, we will refer to the position occupied by the extra A in the CChMVd (+) hammerhead structure, and by any other residue in this or in other hammerhead structures, as position number 10 considering that it is located between the strictly conserved A9 and the highly conserved G10.1 in the consensus hammerhead structure (Figs.1 and 2). The extra A10 of the CChMVd (+) hammerhead structure also holds a special place in the branched secondary structure of lowest free energy predicted for the (+) strand of this viroid (position A27 in the genomic reference sequence of CChMVd), connecting two helices of a cruciform domain (Fig. 2). It is worth noting that the in vivo significance of this proposed branched conformation, which is inactive for self-cleavage, is strongly supported by the analysis of the sequence heterogeneity found in more than 100 natural CChMVd variants, because the observed changes are located in loops or when affecting a base pair the substitutions are compensatory, and also because no variability has been observed at this particular position A27 (13Navarro B. Flores R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11262-11267Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 37De la Peña M. Navarro B. Flores R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9960-9965Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). 2M. De la Peña and R. Flores, unpublished data. In the interest of simplicity and to avoid any confusion that would result from referring to the same residue with two numbers, 10 in the CChMVd (+) hammerhead and 27 in the genomic reference sequence, we will only use the first number. To determine whether the extra A10 plays any role in infectivity, chrysanthemum plants were inoculated with recombinant plasmids containing dimeric tandem inserts of CChMVd cDNA with all possible mutations at this position introduced by site-directed mutagenesis. Ten days later, only those control plants inoculated with the plasmid containing the wild-type CChMVd cDNA (pCM5d-A10) developed the characteristic symptoms of the chlorotic mottle disease. All plants inoculated with plasmids containing the substitutions A10→C and A10→U (pCM5d-C10 and pCM5d-U10, respectively) showed symptoms 15–20 days after inoculation, but only two of the four plants inoculated with pCM5d-G10, containing the substitution A10→G, displayed the typical symptoms 25 days after inoculation. Interestingly, none of the plants inoculated with the plasmid not containing A10 (pCM5d-Δ10) developed symptoms during the observation period (up to 3 months). Analysis by dot-blot hybridization confirmed that the inoculated plants showing symptoms were indeed infected, whereas no signal was observed in those remaining symptomless (data not shown). These experiments were repeated twice with similar results. When the inoculations were performed with the monomeric CChMVd RNAs resulting from self-cleavage during in vitro transcription of the dimeric cDNA inserts, symptoms induced by RNAs with the substitutions A10→C, A10→U, and A10→G, appeared with only a short delay (1–2 days) with respect to those induced by the wild-type RNA, but again none of the plants inoculated with the RNA without A10 developed symptoms, and dot-blot hybridization confirmed that they had not been infected. Reverse transcription-PCR amplifications of viroid progenies from the infected chrysanthemum plants and sequencing of the resulting full-length clones (from 5 to 9 for each construct) revealed that the three substitutions at position 10 had reverted to the original A10 in all cases. Altogether, these results demonstrate that the A10 residue is indispensable for infectivity. CChMVd sequences with substitutions at this position are less infectious, most likely because they have to revert to the wild type, whereas the reversion does not occur when this residue is deleted. The higher infectivity of CChMVd RNAs when compared with their cDNAs is not surprising considering that the latter must be recognized and transcribed by a host RNA polymerase before entering into the standard RNA-RNA replication cycle. To initially assess the effect of the extra A10 residue on the catalytic activity of the CChMVd (+) hammerhead structure, we determined the extent of self-cleavage of CChMVd (+) RNAs transcribed from five recombinant plasmids containing monomeric inserts with the wild-type CChMVd sequence (pCM5-A10), with the three possible substitutions at this position (pCM5-C10, pCM5-G10 and pCM5-U10) and with the A10 deleted (pCM5-Δ10). The extent to which the five RNAs self-cleaved during transcription ranged from ∼55% (the wild-type RNA and those with the changes A10→U and A10→G) to 65% (the A10→C and A10→Δ RNAs) (Fig.3). When the uncleaved monomeric transcripts were purified and incubated under standard self-cleavage conditions (39Forster A.C. Davies C. Hutchins C.J. Symons R.H. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 181: 583-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), the differences were even smaller with the extent of self-cleavage varying between 65 and 70% (data not shown). Although these experiments seemed to suggest that the extra A10 does not play a major role in the catalytic efficiency of the CChMVd (+) hammerhead structure, the extent of self-cleavage measured using full-length CChMVd (+) transcripts and only one reaction time was probably too rough an estimate for this aim. Therefore, we decided to re-examine this question using a more accurate approach. Since the observed self-cleavage could be influenced by either vector or viroid sequences external to the hammerhead structure, or even by the cloning site of the viroid cDNA and by some of the components present in the in vitro transcription reaction, a kinetic analysis under protein-free conditions of the minimal CChMVd (+) hammerhead structure in the well known I/III trans format (35Stage-Zimmermann T.K. Uhlenbeck O.C. RNA. 1998; 4: 875-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) (Fig.4), was performed. The substrate was the same in all cases, whereas the ribozyme contained the wild-type sequence of CChMVd (+) hammerhead structure and the mutants A10→Δ, A10→C, A10→G, and A10→U.

Using gel-filtration chromotography and glycerol gradient sedimentation, we demonstrate that SeqA exists as a homotetramer. SeqA tetramers are able to aggregate or multimerize in a reversible, concentration-dependent manner. Using a bacterial two-hybrid system, we demonstrate that the N-terminal region of SeqA, especifically the 9th amino acid residue, glutamic acid, is required for functional SeqA-SeqA interaction. Although the SeqA(E9K) mutant protein, containing lysine rather than glutamic acid at the 9th amino acid residue, exists as a tetramer, the mutant protein binds to hemimethylated DNA with altered binding patterns as compared with wild-type SeqA. Aggregates of SeqA(E9K) are defective in hemimethylated DNA binding. Here we demonstrate that proper interaction between SeqA tetramers is required for both hemimethylated DNA binding and formation of active aggregates. SeqA tetramers and aggregates might be involved in the formation of SeqA foci required for the segregation of chromosomal DNA as well as the regulation of chromosomal initiation.

Like all chromosomal GATC sites, these sequences are methylated by Dam methyltransferase at the 6-amino group of the adenine residue (3Geier G.E. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 1408-1413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following replication, GATC sites are in a hemimethylated state; the parent strand retains its methylation while the nascent strand lacks methylation (4Campbell J.L. Kleckner N. Cell. 1990; 62: 967-979Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Conversion of DNA from the hemi to fully methylated state is a relatively rapid process. However, atoriC, methylation is inhibited for one-third of the cell cycle. This delay is due to SeqA protein sequestration of hemimethylated oriC; sequestration is important in preventing premature initiation (5Lu M. Campbell J.L. Boye E. Kleckner N. Cell. 1994; 77: 413-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 6Slater S. Wold S. Lu M. Boye E. Skarstad K. Kleckner N.

Preferential binding of SeqA to hemimethylated DNA requires at least two hemimethylated GATC sequences situated on the same face of the DNA helix (7Brendler T. Austin S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2304-2310Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 8Brendler T. Sawitzke J. Sergueev K. Austin S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6249-6258Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was proposed that stable binding of SeqA to hemimethylated DNA requires cooperative interaction between SeqA proteins.Given the role of SeqA in oriC sequestration, it has been suggested that SeqA is a negative modulator of chromosomal initiation (5Lu M. Campbell J.L. Boye E. Kleckner N. Cell. 1994; 77: 413-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 9Boye E. Stokke T. Kleckner N. Skastad K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12206-12211Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In support of this hypothesis, seqA mutants demonstrate asynchronous and increased frequencies of initiation. In addition to this regulatory role, SeqA appears to be involved in nucleoid organization and chromosomal segregation (10Hiraga S. Ichinose C. Niki H. Yamazoe M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 381-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 11Onogi T. Niki H. Yamazoe M. Hiraga S. Mol.

Even in the absence of oriC, SeqA forms foci on chromosomal DNA. These foci are dispersed in dam mutants and depend upon continuous chromosomal replication, implying that SeqA foci formation is dependent upon hemimethylated chromosomal DNA (8Brendler T.

Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1775-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) indicate that interactions must occur between SeqA proteins. In this report, we analyzed the physical interaction between SeqA tetramers and found that amino acid 9, a glutamic acid residue, is required for proper SeqA interaction.DISCUSSIONAssuming a cylindrical shape of E. coli with a diameter and length of 1 and 2 μm, respectively, 1,000 molecules of SeqA (5Lu M. Campbell J.L. Boye E. Kleckner N. Cell. 1994; 77: 413-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar) is roughly equivalent to a concentration of 20 μg/ml (or 1 μm). Given the tetrameric nature of SeqA at concentrations of 11 to 12 μg/ml in vitro (Figs. 1 and 2, and Table I), it is likely that SeqA associates as a tetramer in vivo. The existence of higher molecular weight forms of SeqA, all possessing similar specific activities (Fig. 1 and Table I), indicates that SeqA tetramers reversibly multimerize or aggregate in a concentration-dependent manner. Broad elution and sedimentation patterns of SeqA in gel-filtration chromatography and glycerol gradients suggest that SeqA tetramers form a heterogeneously aggregated mixture at a given concentration.In previous studies it was determined that SeqA requires two hemimethylated GATC sequences, spaced up to 31 bases apart, on the same face of the DNA helix, for stable binding (7Brendler T. Austin S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2304-2310Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 8Brendler T. Sawitzke J. Sergueev K. Austin S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6249-6258Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). It was proposed that the binding was stabilized by cooperative interaction between SeqA proteins transiently bound to each GATC site. In the wild-type SeqA fast migrating complex shown in Fig. 6 D and Ref. 18Kang S. Lee H. Han J.S. Hwang D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11463-11468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, it appears that one SeqA tetramer binds to the GATC site in the L 13-mer; another SeqA appears to bind to one of the other 3 GATC sites. Once bound the two SeqA proteins interact with each other, thus forming the fast-migrating complex. In this case, binding to the other three sites is distributive, and then those bindings could be undetected inin situ footprinting analysis. In this and previous reports, SeqA binding experiments were performed using more or less than 100 nm (or 2 μg/ml) SeqA (6Slater S. Wold S. Lu M. Boye E. Skarstad K. Kleckner N. Cell. 1995; 82: 927-936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 7Brendler T. Austin S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2304-2310Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 8Brendler T.

Chem. 1999; 274: 11463-11468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Therefore, the observed concentration-dependent aggregates formed prior to DNA binding would not directly contribute to the hemimethylated DNA binding at lower SeqA concentrations. Rather, the close proximity of SeqA tetramers transiently bound to GATC sequences would allow for tetramer interaction, to stabilize hemimethylated DNA binding as previously proposed (7Brendler T. Austin S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2304-2310Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 8Brendler T. Sawitzke J. Sergueev K. Austin S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6249-6258Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), which would be similar in manner to the concentration-dependent aggregation of the SeqA protein. Corroborating this proposal, large complexes of SeqA bound to hemimethylated oriC, containing more than 11 GATC sequences, can be observed using electron microscopy (12Skarstad K. Lueder G. Lurz R. Speck C. Messer W. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 1319-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and gel-shift experiments (6Slater S. Wold S. Lu M. Boye E. Skarstad K. Kleckner N. Cell. 1995; 82: 927-936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar).Of all the single substitution seqA mutations tested for SeqA-SeqA interactions using the two-hybrid assay, the SeqA(E9K) mutant exhibited the lowest interaction. However, all the mutants containing multiple amino acid substitutions exhibited less SeqA-SeqA interactions than the SeqA(E9K) mutant (Fig. 4 B and Table III). These results indicate that other amino acids contribute, either synergistically or additively, to proper SeqA-SeqA interactions. The two-hybrid system used in screening for seqA mutants defective in SeqA-SeqA interaction cannot discriminate between the tetramer and oligomer form of SeqA tetramers. It appears that the SeqA(E9K) mutant is defective in the oligomerization. Gel-filtration studies (Fig. 7) demonstrated that SeqA(E9K), like wild-type SeqA, forms tetramers. However, unlike wild-type, SeqA(E9K) is unable to form active aggregates. SeqA(E9K) also exhibits altered gel-shift binding patterns as compared with wild-type when probed with a hemimethylated, 6 or 4 GATC sequence-containing DNA oligonucleotide (Fig. 6). SeqA(E9K) is unable to bind a hemimethylated DNA probe containing 3 GATC sites. The hemimethylated DNA probes containing 6 or 4 GATC sites differed in GATC site spacing and nucleotide sequences as compared with 3 GATC site, hemimethylated probes (7Brendler T. Austin S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2304-2310Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 18Kang S. Lee H. Han J.S. Hwang D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11463-11468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These differences might allow SeqA(E9K) to bind the 4 or 6 GATC sites, hemimethylated probe, rather than the 3 GATC site probe. It is also possible that defect in the interaction between SeqA(E9K) tetramers (Fig. 4 B and Fig. 7) might cause SeqA(E9K) to require more GATC sites to form a stable complex than wild-type SeqA. The reduced number of shifted bands and its altered migration pattern by SeqA(E9K) as compared with wild-type SeqA suggest that interaction between SeqA(E9K) tetramers bound to GATC sites is different from the interaction between wild-type tetramers. This altered interaction between SeqA(E9K) tetramers may cause the formation of inactive (or less active) SeqA(E9K) aggregates.Many proteins, including ClpB (26Barnett M.E. Zolkiewska A.

Virology. 2000; 277: 450-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), exert their biological functions through oligomerization or multimerization in a concentration-dependent manner. The reversible aggregation of SeqA tetramers may contribute to the formation of SeqA foci necessary for the segregation of chromosomal DNA. Aggregation may also be important in binding of SeqA to hemimethylated DNA. Although many GATC sequences are mostly clustered within and near oriC, the SeqA foci is not dependent uponoriC (10Hiraga S. Ichinose C. Niki H. Yamazoe M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 381-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). However, hemimethylation of GATC sites is a requirement for proper SeqA foci formation. If increase in SeqA concentrations is insufficient during cell cycle for foci formation, these observations suggest that a factor(s) may trigger or aid thein vivo SeqA aggregation for foci formation on the hemimethylated chromosome. In Escherichia coli, initiation of chromosomal replication occurs at the origin of chromosomal replication,oriC (1Messer W. Weigel C. Neidhardt F.C.

SeqA(E9K) is unable to bind a hemimethylated DNA probe containing 3 GATC sites. The hemimethylated DNA probes containing 6 or 4 GATC sites differed in GATC site spacing and nucleotide sequences as compared with 3 GATC site, hemimethylated probes (7Brendler T. Austin S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2304-2310Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 18Kang S. Lee H. Han J.S. Hwang D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11463-11468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These differences might allow SeqA(E9K) to bind the 4 or 6 GATC sites, hemimethylated probe, rather than the 3 GATC site probe. It is also possible that defect in the interaction between SeqA(E9K) tetramers (Fig. 4 B and Fig. 7) might cause SeqA(E9K) to require more GATC sites to form a stable complex than wild-type SeqA. The reduced number of shifted bands and its altered migration pattern by SeqA(E9K) as compared with wild-type SeqA suggest that interaction between SeqA(E9K) tetramers bound to GATC sites is different from the interaction between wild-type tetramers. This altered interaction between SeqA(E9K) tetramers may cause the formation of inactive (or less active) SeqA(E9K) aggregates.Many proteins, including ClpB (26Barnett M.E. Zolkiewska A.

Virology. 2000; 277: 450-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), exert their biological functions through oligomerization or multimerization in a concentration-dependent manner. The reversible aggregation of SeqA tetramers may contribute to the formation of SeqA foci necessary for the segregation of chromosomal DNA. Aggregation may also be important in binding of SeqA to hemimethylated DNA. Although many GATC sequences are mostly clustered within and near oriC, the SeqA foci is not dependent uponoriC (10Hiraga S. Ichinose C. Niki H. Yamazoe M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 381-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). However, hemimethylation of GATC sites is a requirement for proper SeqA foci formation. If increase in SeqA concentrations is insufficient during cell cycle for foci formation, these observations suggest that a factor(s) may trigger or aid thein vivo SeqA aggregation for foci formation on the hemimethylated chromosome. Assuming a cylindrical shape of E. coli with a diameter and length of 1 and 2 μm, respectively, 1,000 molecules of SeqA (5Lu M. Campbell J.L. Boye E. Kleckner N. Cell. 1994; 77: 413-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar) is roughly equivalent to a concentration of 20 μg/ml (or 1 μm). Given the tetrameric nature of SeqA at concentrations of 11 to 12 μg/ml in vitro (Figs. 1 and 2, and Table I), it is likely that SeqA associates as a tetramer in vivo. The existence of higher molecular weight forms of SeqA, all possessing similar specific activities (Fig. 1 and Table I), indicates that SeqA tetramers reversibly multimerize or aggregate in a concentration-dependent manner. Broad elution and sedimentation patterns of SeqA in gel-filtration chromatography and glycerol gradients suggest that SeqA tetramers form a heterogeneously aggregated mixture at a given concentration. In previous studies it was determined that SeqA requires two hemimethylated GATC sequences, spaced up to 31 bases apart, on the same face of the DNA helix, for stable binding (7Brendler T. Austin S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2304-2310Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 8Brendler T. Sawitzke J. Sergueev K. Austin S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6249-6258Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). It was proposed that the binding was stabilized by cooperative interaction between SeqA proteins transiently bound to each GATC site. In the wild-type SeqA fast migrating complex shown in Fig. 6 D and Ref. 18Kang S. Lee H. Han J.S. Hwang D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11463-11468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, it appears that one SeqA tetramer binds to the GATC site in the L 13-mer; another SeqA appears to bind to one of the other 3 GATC sites. Once bound the two SeqA proteins interact with each other, thus forming the fast-migrating complex. In this case, binding to the other three sites is distributive, and then those bindings could be undetected inin situ footprinting analysis. In this and previous reports, SeqA binding experiments were performed using more or less than 100 nm (or 2 μg/ml) SeqA (6Slater S. Wold S. Lu M. Boye E. Skarstad K. Kleckner N. Cell. 1995; 82: 927-936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 7Brendler T. Austin S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2304-2310Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 8Brendler T.

Chem. 1999; 274: 11463-11468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Therefore, the observed concentration-dependent aggregates formed prior to DNA binding would not directly contribute to the hemimethylated DNA binding at lower SeqA concentrations. Rather, the close proximity of SeqA tetramers transiently bound to GATC sequences would allow for tetramer interaction, to stabilize hemimethylated DNA binding as previously proposed (7Brendler T. Austin S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2304-2310Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 8Brendler T. Sawitzke J. Sergueev K. Austin S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6249-6258Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), which would be similar in manner to the concentration-dependent aggregation of the SeqA protein. Corroborating this proposal, large complexes of SeqA bound to hemimethylated oriC, containing more than 11 GATC sequences, can be observed using electron microscopy (12Skarstad K. Lueder G. Lurz R. Speck C. Messer W. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 1319-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and gel-shift experiments (6Slater S. Wold S. Lu M. Boye E. Skarstad K. Kleckner N. Cell. 1995; 82: 927-936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Of all the single substitution seqA mutations tested for SeqA-SeqA interactions using the two-hybrid assay, the SeqA(E9K) mutant exhibited the lowest interaction. However, all the mutants containing multiple amino acid substitutions exhibited less SeqA-SeqA interactions than the SeqA(E9K) mutant (Fig. 4 B and Table III). These results indicate that other amino acids contribute, either synergistically or additively, to proper SeqA-SeqA interactions. The two-hybrid system used in screening for seqA mutants defective in SeqA-SeqA interaction cannot discriminate between the tetramer and oligomer form of SeqA tetramers. It appears that the SeqA(E9K) mutant is defective in the oligomerization. Gel-filtration studies (Fig. 7) demonstrated that SeqA(E9K), like wild-type SeqA, forms tetramers. However, unlike wild-type, SeqA(E9K) is unable to form active aggregates. SeqA(E9K) also exhibits altered gel-shift binding patterns as compared with wild-type when probed with a hemimethylated, 6 or 4 GATC sequence-containing DNA oligonucleotide (Fig. 6). SeqA(E9K) is unable to bind a hemimethylated DNA probe containing 3 GATC sites. The hemimethylated DNA probes containing 6 or 4 GATC sites differed in GATC site spacing and nucleotide sequences as compared with 3 GATC site, hemimethylated probes (7Brendler T. Austin S.

Reduction of mitomycin C (40 μm) by sodium borohydride (200 μm) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA at 37 °C, pH 7.4, gives a 50–60% yield of the reactive intermediate mitomycin C hydroquinone.

Chem. Biol. 1995; 2: 575-579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). The one-electron reduction product, the mitomycin C semiquinone radical anion (MC⨪),1 reacts with molecular oxygen (itself a stable diradical) at close to the diffusion controlled rate (109 to 1010m−1 s−1) to give the parent mitomycin C (MC) quinone and superoxide (O⨪2) (2Kalyanaraman B. Perez-Reyes E. Mason R.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 630: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Since very few cross-links are required to give rise to a lethal event (3Syzbalski W. Iyer V.N. Fed. Proc. 1964; 23: 946-957PubMed Google Scholar), the regeneration of MC and the production of a superoxide anion, a species of low toxicity relative to a DNA cross-link, represents a detoxification step. Under physiological oxygen concentrations, the half-life of MC⨪ would be expected to be less than 0.1 ms. Therefore, in the presence of physiological concentrations of oxygen, only an extremely small proportion of the MC⨪ produced could be involved in the direct alkylation of biomolecules, and the yields of DNA cross-links via this pathway would be negligible. The two-electron reduced species, mitomycin C hydroquinone (MCH2), does not react rapidly with oxygen and, therefore, cross-links DNA in a manner largely independent of the concentration of oxygen. Thus, the degree of initial DNA damage by MC under aerobic conditions almost exclusively depends upon a two-electron reduction to MCH2. Under very low oxygen concentrations, greater cellular damage would be expected, reflecting the rate of production of both MCH2 and MC⨪. There is also evidence that most of the damage resulting from the production of MC⨪ under hypoxic conditions is due to disproportionation (4Kumar G.S. Lipman R. Cummings J. Tomasz M. Biochemistry. 1998; 36: 14128-14136Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar) or further reduction of MC⨪ to MCH2 and subsequent formation of an alkylating species therefrom, and not due to the direct interaction of MC⨪ with DNA. Such processes may also play a role in aerobic alkylations following one-electron reduction, but competition from the reaction of MC⨪ with O2 is likely to greatly reduce the interaction of MC⨪ with further reducing molecules. In biological systems MC can be reduced by a variety of enzymes, some favoring one- and some two-electron activation (5Sartorelli A.C. Hodnick W.F. Belcourt M.F. Tomasz M. Haffty B. Fischer J.J. Rockwell S. Oncol. Res. 1994; 6: 501-508PubMed Google Scholar). Solid tumors show resistance to therapeutic modalities such as radiation due to areas of hypoxia arising from poor tumor vascularization (6Denekamp J. Steel G.G. Adams G.E. Peckham M.J.

Mitomycin antibiotics have been used as an adjunct to x-irradiation to selectively target the radiation-resistant hypoxic fraction of human tumors (7Haffty B.G. Son Y.H. Sasak C.T. Papac R.

One of these genes,mcrA, codes for a 54-kDa protein (MCRA) that appears to be a mitomycin C hydroquinone oxidase (13August P.R. Flicker M.C. Sherman D.H. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4448-4454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Belcourt M.F. Penketh P.G. Hodnick W.F. Johnson D.A. Sherman D.H. Rockwell S. Sartorelli A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10489-10494Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Expression of the cDNA for the bacterial resistance protein MCRA in CHO-K1/dhfr−cells resulted in profound resistance to MC in these cells under aerobic conditions, with little change in sensitivity to MC under hypoxia (14Belcourt M.F. Penketh P.G. Hodnick W.F. Johnson D.A. Sherman D.H. Rockwell S. Sartorelli A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10489-10494Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The marked resistance to MC under aerobic conditions observed in MCRA-expressing CHO-K1/dhfr− cells resembles that produced in cell lines selected for resistance to MC under aerobic conditions (14Belcourt M.F. Penketh P.G. Hodnick W.F. Johnson D.A. Sherman D.H. Rockwell S. Sartorelli A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10489-10494Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that a mechanism of resistance based upon the oxidation of MCH2 by a functional homologue of the MCRA protein may be operative. Since many peroxidases have high affinities for hydroxylated aromatic compounds and hydroquinones as oxidizable substrates, we compared the ability of various peroxidases to that of MCRA to oxidize MCH2 and to inhibit DNA cross-linking. In this report we demonstrate that horseradish peroxidase (HRP), myeloperoxidase (MP), and lactoperoxidase (LP) oxidize MCH2 in the presence of a source of hydrogen peroxide and prevents to various degrees the cross-linking of T7 DNA by MCH2. T7 DNA and other chemicals and enzymes were purchased from Sigma, except where specified. Peroxidase purity was accessed by determining the Rz value (the Rz value equals the ratio of the absorbance at the heme prosthetic group Soret band λmax to that of the protein band λmax) for the various enzyme preparations; for HRP (affinity-purified) the Rz (A403 nm/A275 nm) value was equal to that reported for the pure protein (15Maehly A.C. Methods Enzymol. 1955; 2: 801-813Crossref Scopus (161) Google Scholar), for LP the Rz value (A412 nm/A280 nm) was 89% of that reported for the pure protein (16Polis B.D. Shmukler H.W. Methods Enzymol. 1955; 2: 813-817Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar), and for MP the Rz value (A430 nm/A275 nm) was 60% of that reported for the pure protein (17Maehly A.C. Methods Enzymol. 1955; 2: 794-801Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Hoechst 33258 was obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Purified MCRA was prepared by David H. Sherman, and MC was supplied by Bristol Myers-Squibb, Inc. (Wallingford, CT). Stock solutions of MC (2.8 mm) and sodium borohydride (NaBH4) (20 mm) were made in isopropanol, which was used because it is an excellent hydroxide radical scavenger. Theoretically, the indirect generation of hydroxide radicals as a consequence of the redox cycling of MC, the reduction of oxygen by NaBH4, or the action of potentially protective peroxidases could interfere with the DNA cross-linking assay by introducing strand breaks. Therefore, since the objective was to examine DNA-DNA cross-linking by MC/NaBH4 and enzymatic inhibition of cross-linking, the prevention of radical nicking was essential to these measurements. The final concentration of isopropanol in the reaction mixture was 2.4%, which was more than sufficient to prevent radical nicking in this system (18Lown J.W. Begleiter A. Johnson D. Morgan A.R. Can. J. Biochem. 1976; 54: 110-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). DNA cross-linking kinetics and the extent of DNA cross-linking were determined using a DNA renaturation assay (14Belcourt M.F. Penketh P.G. Hodnick W.F. Johnson D.A. Sherman D.H. Rockwell S. Sartorelli A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10489-10494Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 19Penketh P.G. Shyam K. Sartorelli A.C. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 252: 210-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The assay is based upon the observation that, under conditions of neutral pH, upon snap cooling thermally denatured covalently cross-linked T7 DNA rapidly renatures since the strands are held in register, yielding a highly fluorescent complex with H33258, whereas T7 DNA containing no cross-links does not. T7 DNA at a concentration of 100 μg/ml in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer containing 1 mm EDTA and 40 μm MC at pH 7.4 was reacted with NaBH4. The cross-linking reaction was initiated by the addition of 1% by volume of freshly prepared 20 mm NaBH4 solution in isopropanol, which was prepared by a 25-fold dilution of a 0.5 m solution of NaBH4 in 2-methoxyethyl ether with dry isopropanol. The final concentration of NaBH4 in the reaction mixture was 200 μm. Small (15 μl) aliquots were removed at various time intervals, diluted 100-fold with 5 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 mm EDTA buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.1 μg/ml H33258, and assayed for DNA cross-links. The 100-fold dilution of DNA and alkylating agent effectively prevents significant further reaction. The concentrations of reactants were chosen to give a maximum of ∼30–50% of the DNA being cross-linked (i.e. at least one cross-link in 30–50% of the molecules). The potential nicking by radicals or other species under the reaction conditions employed was ascertained by measuring the decrease in the fluorescence of the complex of H33258 and the stably pre-cross-linked DNA following a heat/chill cycle (19Penketh P.G. Shyam K. Sartorelli A.C. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 252: 210-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 20Penketh P.G. Shyam K. Sartorelli A.C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 283-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The pre-cross-linked T7 DNA was prepared by treating 0.5 mg/ml DNA with 0.2 mm1,2-bis(methylsulfonyl)-1-(2-chloroethyl)hydrazine in 10 mmTris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA buffer, pH 8.0, for 24 h at 37 °C. Fluorescence measurements were performed using a Hoefer Scientific Instruments TKO 100 fluorometer. HPLC measurements of the loss and regeneration of MC were performed in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer containing 1 mm EDTA, 40 μm MC, and 200 μm NaBH4 at pH 7.4 using a modification of the method of Kumar et al. (4Kumar G.S. Lipman R. Cummings J. Tomasz M. Biochemistry. 1998; 36: 14128-14136Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar). All spectroscopic determinations were performed using a Beckman model 25 spectrophotometer at 575 nm. In these studies, MC and NaBH4were used at increased final concentrations of 200 and 500 μm, respectively, because of the low absorbances of MC and the MC-derived species being measured at 575 nm. Stock solutions of 10 mm MC and 50 mm NaBH4 in isopropanol were employed for these studies. All cuvettes were freshly acid-washed (HCl/HNO3) and stored submerged in distilled H2O prior to use. This procedure minimized problems due to bubble formation on and adhesion to the faces of the cuvettes. The decomposition kinetics of NaBH4 in 20 mmTris-HCl buffer containing 1 mm EDTA and 20 μg/ml phenol red at pH 7.4 were determined by following the change in absorbance of phenol red at 560 nm, which varies linearly with very small molar changes in the consumption or generation of hydrogen ions (21Penketh P.G. Shyam K. Patton C.L. Sartorelli A.C. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 238: 46-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The measurements were based upon the alkalinization of the medium from the consumption of 1 mol of protons/mol of NaBH4 during its decomposition at pH values close to neutrality, as represented in the following reaction. NaBH4+3H2O+H+→Na++H3BO3+4H2↑ REACTION 1 The alkalinization occurs because at pH values close to neutrality boric acid (pKa 10.2) is essentially undissociated. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 2–4 μl of 20 mm NaBH4 in isopropanol/2-methoxyethyl ether (25:1, v/v) per milliliter of assay mixture. The quantity of H2O2 generated during the decomposition of NaBH4 in air saturated buffer was estimated using a modification of the method of Pick and Keisari (22Pick E. Keisari Y. J. Immunol. Methods. 1980; 38: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar), which is based upon the oxidation of phenol red by H2O2/HRP to a compound that absorbs strongly at 610 nm at high pH values. The quantity of H2O2 generated was determined by comparing the absorption values to a standard curve. The oxidation of hydroquinone (QH2) by HRP, LP, or MP was evaluated by following the decrease in absorption of QH2 at 288 nm in a 20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA buffer, pH 7.4, at 37 °C. The decomposition kinetics of NaBH4 in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA buffer, pH 7.4, using a protometric assay at 37 °C appeared to follow first order or pseudo first order kinetics with a shortt 12 value of 4.7 ± 0.9 s (Fig.1). If the rate of reduction of MC by NaBH4 is assumed to be proportional to the concentration of NaBH4, the rate of reduction of MC would be expected to follow the disappearance of NaBH4 and occur rapidly over a short temporal window, resulting in the bolus production of MCH2. Reduction of MC to form MCH2 should result in a disruption of the extended conjugation of the double bonds, resulting in a shift in the absorption maxima to lower wavelengths and in a bleaching of absorbance at higher wavelengths. However, upon the subsequent formation of high absorbing mitosene products, the absorbance at these wavelengths should then increase beyond the initial level of MC. Visible spectral scans of MC before and at various times after the addition of NaBH4 were performed, and a rapid bleaching followed by a rise in absorbance beyond the original level was observed, centered around 575 nm. At 37 °C, the bleaching at 575 nm was maximal within 3–5 s (Fig. 1). This bleaching was followed by a progressive increase in absorption at this wavelength to approximately twice the absorption of the initial MC solution and appeared to follow first order or pseudo first order kinetics with at 12 value of 14.8 ± 2.8 s at 37 °C and pH 7.4. This finding is consistent with the “pulse-like” generation of MCH2. HPLC studies indicated that only about one half of the initial amount of MC was reduced under these conditions despite the 5-fold molar excess of NaBH4. The shortt 12 of NaBH4 due to its rapid reaction with the vast molar excess of H2O provides a possible explanation for the limited reduction of the available MC. Since only ∼50% of the MC was reduced, the initial reduction product(s) has little absorption at 575 nm compared with MC and the mitosene products subsequently generated have ∼2–3-fold greater absorption at 575 nm than MC. The rate of production of mitosenes was highly temperature-sensitive with the t 12 at 30 °C being ∼30 s compared to ∼15 s at 37 °C (Fig. 2 A). Addition of MCRA prior to the reduction of MC by NaBH4blocked these spectral changes under aerobic conditions (Fig.2 B). MC is believed to react following reduction as shown in Fig. 3; the methoxy group at position 9a is lost subsequent to hydroquinone formation to give leuco-aziridinomitosene. Oxidation after the formation of leuco-aziridinomitosene cannot result in the regeneration of MC, which can only occur if enzymatic oxidation occurs at the level of MCH2. Addition of MCRA at the point of maximum bleaching (3–5 s after the NaBH4) gives results almost equivalent to those obtained by the addition of MCRA prior to NaBH4. The spectroscopic absorption is restored to close to the original MC level without the production of high absorbing mitosenes; the bleaching dip is reduced slightly in magnitude when MCRA is added prior to the NaBH4, probably due to some MCRA mediated re-oxidation occurring during the reduction phase. The late addition of MCRA,i.e. at the maximum MCH2 concentration, served to combat the argument that the MCRA merely prevented the initial reduction of MC.Figure 3Oxidative inactivation of MCH2. Figure shows the scheme proposed to describe the reductive activation of MC by NaBH4, and the oxidative inactivation of MCH2 by HRP/H2O2and MCRA, resulting in the regeneration of MC.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) HPLC analysis indicated that, when MCRA was initially present in the reaction mixture, essentially all of the MCH2 was back-oxidized to MC and there was little or no net MC loss or mitosene formed (Table I). Addition of MCRA or HRP/H2O2 at a time point equivalent to the half-reaction point (∼30 s at 30 °C and pH 7.4), as judged from the spectroscopic studies (Fig. 2 A), reduced the quantity of MC being restored by one half, indicating that one half of the total MCH2 generated must still be present at this time. This finding implies that the t 12 values determined spectroscopically and by DNA cross-linking reflect those for the loss of MCH2 itself and not a subsequent low absorbing species,i.e. the conversion of MCH2 to leuco-aziridinomitosene, which appears to be the rate-determining step. The kinetics do not represent a rate-determining reduction of MC by NaBH4 since the t 12 of NaBH4 is much shorter than that observed for the 575 nm spectral changes, nor can it represent the reaction of a low absorbing component formed subsequent to the loss of the methoxy group since MC regeneration would not be possible after this point (Fig. 3).Table IThe yields of MC as a result of the oxidation of MCH2 by various oxidizing components as determined by HPLCReaction mixtureYield of MC from MCH2%MC (40 μm) + NaBH4 (200 μm)0MC + NaBH4 + MCRA (1 μm)92MC + NaBH4 + (MCRA added att = 30 s and 30 °C)aHalf-reaction time point based on change in absorbance at 575 nm and at 30 °C.40MC + NaBH4 + HRP (2 units/ml)bOne unit will form 1.0 mg of purpurogallin from pyrogallol in 20 s at pH 6.0 and 20 °C.69MC + NaBH4 + HRP + H2O2 (100 μm)66MC + NaBH4 + (HRP + H2O2 added att = 30 s and 30 °C)aHalf-reaction time point based on change in absorbance at 575 nm and at 30 °C.33MC + NaBH4 + H2O22MC + NaBH4 + HRP + catalase (250 units/ml)cOne unit will decompose 1.0 μmol of H2O2/min at pH 7.0 and 25 °C using an initial H2O2 concentration of 10.3 mm.34MC + NaBH4 + LP (20 units/ml)bOne unit will form 1.0 mg of purpurogallin from pyrogallol in 20 s at pH 6.0 and 20 °C. + H2O237MC + NaBH4 + MP (3.5 units/ml)dOne unit will produce a change in absorbance at 470 nm of 1.0 A/min at pH 7.0 and 25 °C using guaiacol as a substrate. + H2O210The data have been normalized such that the % yield of MC from MCH2 has been calculated relative to the assumed level of MCH2 formation.

Spectroscopic experiments similar to those described above were performed in which peroxidases were substituted for MCRA. Addition of HRP at equivalent time points gave visible spectral traces that were surprisingly similar to those obtained with MCRA (Fig.4 A). Surprisingly, the addition of H2O2 was not required for HRP to block the production of the high absorbing species (Fig.4 A), to prevent the net loss of MC as determined by HPLC, or to block the cross-linking of T7 DNA by MC (Tables I andII). Thus, like MCRA, HRP catalyzed the regeneration of MC from the bleached material, although the yield was somewhat less. When these experiments were repeated using LP and MP, both of these peroxidases were able to decrease the generation of mitosenes and affect the regeneration of MC from the bleached material to various degrees, but were much less effective than HRP and MCRA (Fig. 5 and Table I). The order of effectiveness was MCRA > HRP > LP > MP.Table IIThe effects of various MCH2 oxidizing components on the level of T7 DNA cross-linking by MCReaction mixtureCross-linking%T7 DNA (100 μg/ml) + MC (40 μm) + NaBH4 (200 μm)47.3 ± 1.2T7 DNA + MC + NaBH4 + MCRA (1 μm)2.3 ± 1.5T7 DNA + MC + NaBH4 + HRP (2 units/ml)aOne unit will form 1.0 mg of purpurogallin from pyrogallol in 20 s at pH 6.0 and 20 °C.7.5 ± 0.9T7 DNA + MC + NaBH4 + HRP + H2O2 (100 μm)2.4 ± 1.2T7 DNA + MC + NaBH4 + H2O2 (100 μm)44.4 ± 1.4T7 DNA + MC + NaBH4 + HRP + catalase (250 units/ml)bOne unit will decompose 1.0 μmol of H2O2/min at pH 7.0 and 25 °C using an initial H2O2 concentration of 10.3 mm.30.4 ± 4.1T7 DNA + MC + NaBH4 + LP (4 units/ml)aOne unit will form 1.0 mg of purpurogallin from pyrogallol in 20 s at pH 6.0 and 20 °C. + H2O217.2 ± 1.0T7 DNA + MC + NaBH4+ MP (3.5 units/ml)cOne unit will produce a change in absorbance at 470 nm of 1.0 A/min at pH 7.0 and 25 °C using guaiacol as a substrate. + H2O211.8 ± 0.7The inhibition of DNA cross-linking by NaBH4 reduced MC by various peroxidases, in the presence and absence of exogenously added H2O2, and by MCRA.

The % cross-linking values are the arithmetic means of three determinations ± the standard deviation. The absence of a requirement for H2O2 to manifest the inhibitory effects of HRP coupled with the observation that catalase antagonized the effects of HRP (Fig. 4 B and Tables I and II) strongly suggested the presence of an endogenous source of H2O2 in the reaction mixture. For a peroxidase to fully protect from the generation of MCH2, an equivalent quantity of H2O2 would be required if a two-electron oxidation occurred. There are three potential sources of H2O2 in the reaction mixture that are initially obvious: (a) the dismutation of O⨪2 generated from the autoxidation of MC⨪; (b) the one-electron oxidation of MCH2 to MC⨪ mediated by peroxidase/H2O2, resulting in a self-propagating chain reaction as a result of further H2O2 generation via MC⨪ autoxidation and O⨪2 dismutation; and (c) the reduction of O2 by NaBH4 to generate H2O2 directly or via O⨪2. Mechanism (a) could not supply sufficient H2O2to oxidize all of the generated MCH2 if a two-electron oxidation were occurring since MCH2 is the major product of MC reduction by NaBH4 under these conditions and MC⨪ is a minor product (14Belcourt M.F. Penketh P.G. Hodnick W.F. Johnson D.A. Sherman D.H. Rockwell S. Sartorelli A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10489-10494Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Autoxidation of the minor product MC⨪ would result in the net generation of 1 mol of H2O2 for every 2 mol of MC⨪ while the peroxidation of the major product MCH2 would require 1 mol of H2O2/mol of MCH2. However, if mechanism (b) were also operative, mechanism (a) could supply sufficient H2O2 to initiate the chain reaction. To explore the feasibility of mechanism (b), which is described in Scheme 1, we have examined the oxidation of the model MCH2 analog hydroquinone (QH2). Oxidation of QH2 by HRP, MP, and LP was measured and shown to require a stoichiometric quantity of H2O2; accordingly, the oxidations catalyzed by the peroxidases proceeded at an insignificant rate in the absence of H2O2. The data for the oxidation of QH2 by HRP in the presence of H2O2 is shown in Fig.6; LP and MP gave identical traces to those obtained with HRP (see Scheme 1). 2HRP (compound I) is the FeVO2− form of HRP and HRP (compound II) is the FeIVO2− form of HRP.

https://openalex.org/W2073398381,"Mutagenesis techniques were used to replace two loop regions within the catalytic domain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A (ETA) with functionally silent polyglycine loops. The loop mutant proteins, designated polyglycine Loops N and C, were both less active than the wild-type enzyme. However, the polyglycine Loop C mutant protein, replaced with the Gly483–Gly490 loop, showed a much greater loss of enzymatic activity than the polyglycine Loop N protein. The former mutant enzyme exhibited an 18,000-fold decrease in catalytic turnover number (kcat), with only a marginal effect on the Km value for NAD+ and the eukaryotic elongation factor-2 binding constant. Furthermore, alanine-scanning mutagenesis of this active-site loop region revealed the specific pattern of a critical region for enzymatic activity. Binding and kinetic data suggest that this loop modulates the transferase activity between ETA and eukaryotic elongation factor-2 and may be responsible for stabilization of the transition state for the reaction. Sequence alignment and molecular modeling also identified a similar loop within diphtheria toxin, a functionally and structurally related class A-B toxin. Based on these results and the similarities between ETA and diphtheria toxin, we propose that this catalytic subregion represents the first report of a diphthamide-specific ribosyltransferase structural motif. We expect these findings to further the development of pharmaceuticals designed to prevent ETA toxicity by disrupting the stabilization of the transition state during the ADP-ribose transfer event.

This aerobic, motile, Gram-negative bacterium survives in most environments, including water, soil, vegetation, and hospitals.P. aeruginosa secretes the highly virulent protein exotoxin A (ETA),1 which is largely responsible for the local tissue damage, bacterial invasion, and possibly immunosuppression within the eukaryotic host (1Van Delden C. Iglewski B.H. Emerg. Infect. Dis. 1998; 4: 551-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). This toxin is extremely lethal, possessing an LD50 of 0.2 μg/animal upon intraperitoneal injection into mice (2Wick M.J. Hamood A.N. Iglewski B.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 527-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). For these reasons, it is often referred to as the most potent virulence factor of this organism (1Van Delden C. Iglewski B.H. Emerg. Infect. Dis. 1998; 4: 551-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). ETA, a mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase (ADPRT) enzyme, is related to several other bacterial toxins composed of four groups classified according to their protein substrates: (i) elongation factor-2 ADP-ribosylating toxins (diphtheria toxin (DT) and ETA), (ii) heterotrimeric G-protein ADP-ribosylating toxins (cholera and pertussis toxins), (iii) toxins that ADP-ribosylate small GTPases (Clostridium botulinum C3 exoenzyme), and (iv) ADP-ribosyltransferases with actin as a substrate (clostridial ADP-ribosyltransferases and Clostridium perfringens toxin) (3Barth H. Preiss J.C. Hofmann F. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29506-29511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). ETA is also catalytically related to the DNA repair enzyme family, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases, which are involved in several physiological events such as chromatin decondensation, DNA replication and repair, gene expression, malignant transformation, cellular differentiation, and apoptosis (4Pieper A.A. Verma A. Zhang J. Snyder S.H. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 171-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 5Jacobson M.K. Jacobson E.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 415-417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). ETA is a 66-kDa extracellular protein (6Beattie B.K. Prentice G.A. Merrill A.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15134-15142Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) that, upon infection, is internalized into the eukaryotic cell so that it can catalyze the ADP-ribosylation of eukaryotic elongation factor-2 (eEF-2) (7Beattie B.K. Merrill A.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9042-9051Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This ADP-ribosylation reaction inactivates eEF-2 through the covalent attachment of the ADP-ribosyl moiety to the diphthamide residue of eEF-2, which results in cessation of protein synthesis and eventually cell death (6Beattie B.K. Prentice G.A. Merrill A.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15134-15142Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Although the NAD+ substrate-docking site within ETA is well characterized (8Li M. Dyda F.

S. A. 1996; 93: 6902-6906Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), the eEF-2 substrate site is virtually unknown (10Lukac M. Collier R.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7629-7632Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 11Wick M.J. Cook J.M. Iglewski B.H. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 1128-1139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Wozniak D.J.

Only a few residues have been implicated to associate with eEF-2: His426, Tyr481, and His440; however, these have not been confirmed. The crystal structures (8Li M. Dyda F. Benhar I. Pastan I. Davies D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9308-9312Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 9Li M. Dyda F. Benhar I. Pastan I. Davies D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6902-6906Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) show that His440 is located at the base of the active site distant from the scissile N-glycosidic bond; therefore, contact with NAD+ is unlikely at this position. The three-dimensional structure shows Tyr481stacking against the nicotinamide ring of NAD+ (8Li M. Dyda F. Benhar I. Pastan I. Davies D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9308-9312Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 9Li M. Dyda F. Benhar I. Pastan I. Davies D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6902-6906Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Substitution of phenylalanine for Tyr481 alters the rate of reaction, possibly by changing the orientation of the diphthamide on eEF-2 (10Lukac M. Collier R.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7629-7632Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). When mutated to tyrosine, His426 (located in helix I and distant from the active site) renders the protein nontoxic (12Wozniak D.J. Hsu L.-Y. Galloway D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8880-8884Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). An antibody that specifically binds to helix I within ETA shows that NAD+ binding is not affected, thereby implicating eEF-2 binding as the defect in enzymatic activity for the H426Y mutant protein (13McGowan J.L. Kessler S.P. Anderson D.C. Galloway D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4911-4916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, further mutagenic studies involving His426 indicated that its role is not eEF-2 binding, but rather maintaining the structure of the active site through the proper alignment of the active-site residues (11Wick M.J. Cook J.M. Iglewski B.H. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 1128-1139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, those residues involved with eEF-2 or the transferase step remain in question. Loop regions are common in forming binding and active sites (15Fetrow J.S. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 708-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 16Donate L.E. Rufino S.D. Canard L.H.J. Blundell T.L. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2600-2616Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Therefore, loop regions were the first targets for investigating the inner workings of the active-site machinery of exotoxin A. In the crystal structures of the catalytic domain of ETA, two surface-exposed loops near the known active site were found (8Li M. Dyda F. Benhar I. Pastan I. Davies D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9308-9312Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 9Li M. Dyda F. Benhar I. Pastan I. Davies D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6902-6906Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). It was proposed that either or both of these loops act as clamps holding eEF-2 near the active site, or perhaps these loops work to stabilize the transition state structure during the ADP-ribosylation reaction. In this study, to elucidate the importance of these loops, the entire region was replaced with glycine; thus, the loop was left intact and flexible, but acted as a functionally silent region. ADP-ribosyltransferase activity and NAD+ binding were determined for all mutant proteins, and the structural stability was evaluated in those mutant proteins that showed reduced activity. One loop region showed a significant decrease in activity compared with the wild-type protein and thus was further analyzed by alanine-scanning mutagenesis (17Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. Science. 1989; 244: 1081-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar). This allowed mapping of the proposed ADP-ribosyltransferase motif. The catalytic fragment of ETA with a C-terminal polyhistidine tag (PE24H) encoded by the plasmid pPH1 was overexpressed in Escherichia coli strain BB101 (λDE3) and purified as described (18Beattie B.K. Merrill A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15646-15654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. The cells were lysed in an osmotic shock lysate solution (19Rasper D.M. Merrill A.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12981-12989Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) containing 10 mm EDTA. The osmotic shock lysate was loaded onto a 10-ml Q-Sepharose Fast Flow anion-exchange column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Baie D'Urfe, Quebec, Canada). The Q-Sepharose column was washed with 50 mm NaCl and 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), and the protein was eluted using 300 mm NaCl and 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9). This eluant was loaded onto a 1-ml chelate-agarose affinity column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) charged with 50 mm NiSO4 as previously described (18Beattie B.K. Merrill A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15646-15654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), except for the purification of the S585C and S585C-pG (where pG is polyglycine)-Loop C mutant proteins, which required the use of 100 mm ZnSO4 to charge the column. Fractions containing purified protein were pooled and dialyzed against 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, and 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.9) and subsequently concentrated to 1 ml using a Centriprep-30 concentrator (Amicon Inc., Beverly, MA). eEF-2 was purified from wheat germ as previously described (20Armstrong S.A.

The pG-Loop N mutation was created using the Kunkel mutagenesis method as described (21Steer B.A. Merrill A.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7225-7233Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Two-stage QuikChangeTM mutagenesis was used to create the polyglycine Loop C and double-loop mutants (DLM; both loops replaced with glycine) (22Wang W.

Alanine-scanning mutants and the S585C-pG-Loop C mutant were prepared by standard QuikChangeTM mutagenesis (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The DNA template was the plasmid pPH1 containing the gene for wild-type PE24H (unless otherwise indicated) using several sets of primers (Table I). The presence of the desired mutation was determined by dideoxy sequencing with an ABI Prism Model 377 DNA sequencer using dye termination and cycle sequencing, and the DNA samples were analyzed on a 4.5% acrylamide gel that was 36 cm in length.Table ISequences of the oligonucleotide primers used to create the polyglycine loop mutants and the alanine-scanning mutants of Loop CMutationPrimer namePrimer sequenceaThe sites of mutation are in boldface and underlined, and each primer is shown in the 5′ to 3′ direction.

Open table in a new tab All steady-state fluorescence measurements (except for the eEF-2 binding assay) were obtained using a PTI Alphascan spectrophotometer interfaced with a computer using FelixTM Version 1.21 software (Photon Technology International) and equipped with a water-jacketed sample chamber set to 25 °C. The ADPRT activity of the various enzyme samples was tested as described previously (20Armstrong S.A. Merrill A.R. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 292: 26-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, the excitation and emission monochromators were set to 305 nm and zero order (no diffraction), respectively, and a 309-nm cutoff filter (Oriel Corp., Stratford, CT) was included on the sample chamber side of the emission monochromator to eliminate scattered excitation light and to maximize the signal. Buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9)), ε-NAD+ (Sigma; various concentrations were used up to 500 μm from an ε-NAD+ stock solution prepared in distilled water; ε M265nm = 6000m−1 cm−1), and 14 μm eEF-2 (at saturating levels) were combined in an ultramicrocuvette (3-mm path length; Helma Inc., Concord, Ontario, Canada). The cuvette was equilibrated at 25 °C for 10 min. Toxin dilutions were performed in siliconized tubes with the buffer described above. The reaction was started by rapidly adding PE24H (final concentrations for toxin ranged from 5 nm to 19 μm depending upon the mutant protein), and the reaction progress was monitored by an increase in fluorescence during the production of ε-ADP-ribose. The assay was performed as described above with the following modifications. Necessary adjustments to the eEF-2 protein solution were made to maintain KCl concentrations at 85 mm since it was stored in 300 mm KCl-containing buffer. Assay conditions were established whereby ε-NAD+ remained constant (500 μm representing saturation) and the concentration of eEF-2 varied (1.5–15 μm). Toxin concentrations ranged from 10 nm to 8.8 μm (final concentration). A stock solution of ε-AMP (Sigma; prepared in distilled water; ε M265nm = 10,000m−1 cm−1) was used to prepare a series of standards in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9). The fluorescence of the ε-AMP standards (0–10 μm) was recorded to generate a standard curve having a slope with units of fluorescence intensity per micromolar ε-AMP. This slope from the standard curve was used to convert the slopes obtained for the ADPRT measurements to catalytic rates with units of micromolar ε-NAD+/s. The NAD+-dependent quenching of the intrinsic protein fluorescence of the tryptophans in PE24H was used to determine the binding constant (KD) for NAD+ and was observed by exciting the protein at 295 nm (4-nm slit width) and measuring the fluorescence intensity with the emission wavelength set to 340 nm (4-nm band pass) as previously described (6Beattie B.K. Prentice G.A. Merrill A.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15134-15142Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Briefly, the protein solution was titrated with concentrations of NAD+ranging from 0 to 981.5 μm in the presence of toxin in an initial volume of 600 μl in 50 mm NaCl and 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9). The final concentration of toxin used in this experiment was 1.25 μm, except for D484A/D488A and Q483A/D484A/D488A, which were at 0.625 μm. Purified PE24H protein (0.5 mg of protein) was incubated in 150 mm NaCl and 200 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1) with an excess of DTT (5 mol of DTT/mol of PE24H) at room temperature for 60 min. A concentrated solution of IAEDANS (in Me2SO) was added to the reaction mixture (5% Me2SO final concentration) to give a molar ratio of 20:1 IAEDANS/PE24H, and the reaction was gently mixed on a nutator for 15 min at room temperature. The reaction was quenched by the addition of an excess of DTT (100 mm final concentration). The quenched sample was loaded onto a prepacked Econo-Pac10DG column (Bio-Rad, Mississauga, Ontario), and the protein adduct was eluted with 150 mm NaCl and 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9). The protein adduct peak was well separated from the free dye peak, with the latter peak appearing in later fractions. The labeled PE24H protein was further characterized by UV and fluorescence spectroscopy using the extinction coefficients for PE24H (ε M280nm = 27,310m−1 cm−1) and for AEDANS (ε M337 nm = 6000m−1 cm−1) (24Steer B.A. Merrill A.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1108-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The labeling efficiency, based on the appropriate absorbances and molar extinction coefficients of the bound fluorophore and the measured protein, was nearly 100% (1 mol of AEDANS/mol of PE24H). Purified wheat germ eEF-2 protein was labeled with 5-iodoacetamide fluorescein (5-IAF; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) by incubation of 1 mg of protein in reaction buffer (200 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1) containing DTT (3 mol of DTT/mol of protein) for 30 min, followed by the addition of a concentrated stock of 5-IAF (20 mg/ml in Me2SO at 10 mol of 5-IAF/mol of protein). The reaction solution was gently mixed on a nutator, and the sulfhydryl labeling reaction was stopped after 10 min at 25 °C by the addition of a 100-fold excess of DTT. The reaction mixture (415 μl) was loaded onto a 10DG column, equilibrated in 50 mm NaCl and 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9); and 0.6-ml fractions were collected. The protein-5-AF adduct eluted from the column in a peak that was completely separated from the free fluorophore peak. The stoichiometry of the labeling reaction was ascertained by determining the eEF-2 concentration using the BCA protein assay with bovine serum albumin as the standard (20Armstrong S.A. Merrill A.R. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 292: 26-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and by absorption spectroscopy using the molar extinction coefficient for 5-AF (ε M492nm = 70,000m−1 cm−1). The stoichiometry of labeling of eEF-2 with 5-AF indicated that only one of the eight sulfhydryl groups within the protein was modified. Aliquots of 5-AF-labeled eEF-2 protein were added to 1.0 μmAEDANS-labeled S585C-PE24H or to AEDANS-labeled S585C-pG-Loop C mutant in 50 mm NaCl and 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.9). The fluorescence intensity of AEDANS was monitored with a Cary Eclipse fluorometer (Varian, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) equipped with a Peltier thermostatted multicell holder at 25 °C with excitation and emission wavelengths at 337 and 460 nm, respectively (5-nm band passes). The raw fluorescence data were corrected for the dilution factor, and the dissociation constant for eEF-2 binding with PE24H was determined using the following equation (two-site binding model): ΔFi/ΔFmax = ([eEF-2]/(KD1 + [eEF-2])) + ([eEF-2]/(KD2 + [eEF-2])), where ΔFi is the change in fluorescence intensity for each ligand (eEF-2) concentration upon macromolecular association, ΔFmax is the maximum change in fluorescence intensity at saturation of the ligand-binding site within PE24H, andKD1 and KD2 are the dissociation constants for the binding of eEF-2 with PE24H. The wild-type and pG-Loop C proteins in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9) were mixed with an appropriate amount of 8 m urea (Pierce) to provide solutions from 0 to 5.5 m urea and 3.6 μg/ml toxin (final concentration). Solutions were incubated at room temperature for a minimum of 15 min before spectroscopic analysis. For tryptophan fluorescence, excitation was at 295 nm, and emission was scanned from 325 to 355 nm in ultramicrocuvettes. The excitation and emission slit widths were both 4 nm. Unfolding profiles were determined as previously described (21Steer B.A. Merrill A.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7225-7233Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar,24Steer B.A. Merrill A.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1108-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The sequences of two loop regions within the catalytic domain of ETA with proposed involvement either in catalysis or through an association with eEF-2 are shown and aligned with the corresponding sequences within DT (Fig.1). The nomenclature (ETA numbering) for these loops is such that the loop closest to the N terminus of the protein is termed Loop N (Arg458–Ala464), and the loop closest to the C terminus is Loop C (Gln483–Arg490). The alignment of these two loops within ETA did not produce a good match between Loop N and the corresponding loop within DT; however, the alignment of Loop C showed good alignment (sequence identity and homology) with the corresponding loop within DT (Fig. 1). Notably, there is sequence conservation at Asp484 and Glu486 within the Loop C region of these two diphthamide-specific toxins. Interestingly, Loop C did not appear in the original crystal structure of intact whole ETA (25Allured V.S. Collier R.J. Carroll S.F. McKay D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1320-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar); however, it was resolved in the structure of the catalytic domain of ETA (8Li M. Dyda F. Benhar I. Pastan I. Davies D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9308-9312Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 9Li M. Dyda F. Benhar I. Pastan I. Davies D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6902-6906Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of Loop N was not fully resolved in the catalytic domain structure that bound a less hydrolyzable NAD+ analog, β-methylene-thiazole-4-carboxamide adenine dinucleotide (β-TAD+), as it was disordered (9Li M. Dyda F. Benhar I. Pastan I. Davies D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6902-6906Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), but was evident in the structures of whole ETA and the catalytic domain complexed with nicotinamide and AMP (8Li M. Dyda F. Benhar I. Pastan I. Davies D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9308-9312Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). It has been shown that, upon proteolytic cleavage within a helix in the translocation domain of the whole toxin, Loop N moves to allow greater access to the active site; and consequently, it has been proposed to interact with eEF-2 due to its solvent exposure upon shifting (9Li M. Dyda F. Benhar I. Pastan I. Davies D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6902-6906Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). One possibility in the study of the importance of either Loop N or C would be to delete the entire region. However, analysis of the crystal structure (9Li M. Dyda F. Benhar I. Pastan I. Davies D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6902-6906Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) showed that this might not be advisable. The distance between the beginning and end of the loop is significant, and its removal would impose tight constraints on the protein structure, thereby altering it. The distance between the beginning and end of Loop C was determined to be 14.6 Å (between the C-α atoms of Gln483 and Arg490), and this distance is 12.4 Å (between the C-α atoms of Ala457 and Ala464) for Loop N. An alternative to loop deletion mutants was to replace each loop with a glycine segment. Glycine is a very unreactive residue that allows much flexibility in terms of possible main chain conformations. Therefore, in the alternative approach, the loop region is present, but acts essentially as a functionally silent region. These polyglycine loop replacement mutants were constructed in the catalytic domain of ETA (PE24H) (18Beattie B.K. Merrill A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15646-15654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and their importance was initially screened by their ADPRT activity to decide if either or both of these regions were involved in catalysis. The kinetic parameters for NAD+ as substrate for these polyglycine mutants are shown in Table II and were determined with eEF-2 at saturating levels (14 μm). The pG-Loop N mutant protein had a lower activity than the wild-type protein (18-fold decrease). Although the turnover number was affected by this mutation, the Km(ε-NAD+) actually decreased (showing a modest increase in the enzyme's ability to interact with the ε-NAD+ substrate), implying that the effect of Loop N replacement is at the level of catalysis and not substrate docking and binding. However, the effect of Loop N replacement was small in comparison with the effect of Loop C replacement; consequently, we chose to focus our efforts on the Loop C mutant protein. In contrast, kinetic measurements for pG-Loop C showed a drastic loss of activity upon its replacement with glycine residues. The data in Table II indicate that only 0.0056% of the wild-type activity (18,000-fold decrease) was retained in this mutant. However, despite this large activity loss, the effect of Loop C replacement on the Km(ε-NAD+) was opposite to that anticipated if Loop C was involved in substrate binding (5-fold decrease in Km) (Table II). Thus, from a consideration of the specificity constant (Table II), it was evident that this parameter reflected the change inkcat and notKm(ε-NAD+). This indicates that the ability of the mutant toxin to stabilize the transition state species for the ADPRT reaction is likely more affected than the ability to bind the substrate, ε-NAD+. NAD+ binding data for the two polyglycine loop mutants confirmed that NAD+ bound normally to both mutant proteins (Fig. 2), with KDvalue"

Since region V contains both an Sp1 site and an AT-rich element that recognizes an insulin-responsive binding protein (IRBP), we tested the hypothesis that Sp1 interactions are facilitated by an IRBP. Binding of nuclear extracts to region V probes was reduced by mutational or chemical interference with the AT-rich element. Blocking the AT site also reduced interactions of Sp1 with region Vin vitro and blunted transactivation of region V reporter constructs by Sp1 in vivo. Sp1 binding was enhanced by small quantities of hepatic nuclear extracts, but enhancement was reduced by the AT mutation and abolished by a 5-base pair insertion between the AT-rich and GC-rich sites, and transactivation by Sp1in vivo was diminished by inserting bases between the AT-rich and GC-rich elements. However, treating cells with insulin increased the ability of nuclear extracts to enhance Sp1 binding. These findings indicate that the presence of the AT-rich element is essential for the actions of Sp1 in vitro and in vivo, and the combination of both spacing requirements and insulin responsiveness suggests that IRBP may interact directly with Sp1.

Abrogation of hepatic IGF-I production in liver-specific knockout mice resulted in a 75% drop in serum IGF-I levels, and normal growth was maintained only by a 6-fold increase in circulating growth hormone levels, presumably via stimulation of local IGF-I production in extrahepatic tissues (4Sjogren K.

In this study, we provide evidence supporting the hypothesis that IRBP interacts with Sp1 to stimulate binding to region V and expression of the IGF-I gene. Mediatech Cellgro cell culture medium was obtained from Fisher, and fetal bovine serum, antibiotics, and recombinant human insulin were from Life Technologies, Inc. [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.Oligonucleotides corresponding to IGF-I region V were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc., berenil (diminazene aceturate), protease inhibitors, and other chemicals were purchased from Sigma, and recombinant human Sp1 (rhSp1) was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). DNA modifying enzymes were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Reporter plasmids contained tandem copies of IGF-I footprint region V in pGL3-promoter (Promega, Madison, WI). The wtV, VmAT, and VmSp1 constructs have previously been described (14Zhu J.L. Pao C.-I Kaytor E.N. Phillips L.S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2000; 164: 205-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and the VcSp1, V+2, V+5, and V+10 reporters were generated in the same manner. Briefly, double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the sequences listed in Table I were phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase, self-ligated with T4 DNA ligase, and separated on a 3% agarose gel. Bands representing 4-mers were eluted, treated with Taq DNA polymerase to add terminal adenine residues, subcloned into pCR2.1 (a TA cloning vector from Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and then cloned into pGL3 promoter at theKpnI and XhoI sites. The pPacSp1 expression plasmid, containing the strong actin promoter, was provided by Dr. Robert Tjian (24Courey A.J. Tjian R.

CHO cells are used in many laboratories, whereas HepG2 cells are liver-derived and, thus, more likely to be metabolically relevant to studies of “endocrine” production of IGF-I. CHO cells were maintained in F-12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, whereas HepG2 cells were cultured in Eagle's minimal essential medium with 10% serum. Cells were generally cotransfected at 50–60% confluence using 2 μg of reporter plasmid and 0.5 μg of expression plasmid per 35-mm well. CHO cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO). Medium was replaced 2–3 h after transfection and again after 24 h. Cells were harvested for luciferase assays 48 h after transfection. When included, berenil was used at 500 nm. HepG2 cells were transfected overnight with the Targefect F2 reagent (Targeting Systems, San Diego, CA) and harvested for luciferase measurement ∼36 h after transfection. Results were normalized to total protein concentration. The Emory University Animal Care and Use Committee approved all animal use. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Raleigh, NC). Nuclear extracts from livers of normal rats were prepared using a modification of the method previously described (25Lavery D.J. Schibler U. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1871-1884Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Briefly, livers were homogenized in an anaerobic tissue processor in 2m sucrose with 1% dry milk and filtered through cheesecloth, and nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation through a 2m sucrose cushion. Nuclei were resuspended in storage buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.9, 75 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.85 mm DTT, 0.125 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 50% glycerol) and repelleted, followed by lysis in NUN buffer (1.1 m urea, 0.33m NaCl, 1.1% Nonidet P-40, 27.5 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 11% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 1.1% aprotinin, 0.77 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.77 μg/ml pepstatin A). Chinese hamster ovary cells that were stably transfected with the insulin receptor (CHO-IR cells) were obtained from Drs. Barry Goldstein and Morris White. Insulin was dissolved in 10−4 m HCl before use. CHO-IR cells were cultured in F-12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum with or without 10−6 m insulin for 24 h. Nuclear extracts were prepared using the method of Schreiber et al. (26Schreiber E. Matthias P. Müller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17 (6419): 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3902) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, scraped, pelleted, and resuspended in Buffer A (10 mm HEPES pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin). After swelling on ice, cells were lysed by the addition of Nonidet P-40. Nuclei were pelleted, resuspended in Buffer B (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin), and lysed by vigorous shaking on a Vortex mixer. Radiolabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides (50,000 cpm/reaction) were incubated with nuclear extracts in 20 μl of binding buffer containing 5% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 30 min at 25 °C. Reactions usually contained either 3–5 μg of rat liver nuclear extracts or 1–2 footprinting units of rhSp1 with 1 μg of bovine serum albumin. When included, berenil was incubated with the probe for 30 min before the addition of protein at a final berenil concentration of 50 μm. Facilitation experiments contained ∼0.3 μg of nuclear extracts and/or 0.06 footprinting units of rhSp1with 1 μg of bovine serum albumin. Samples were subjected to electrophoresis on 4.5% polyacrylamide gels in TGE buffer (25 mm Tris, 190 mm glycine, and 1 mm EDTA) at 4 °C and 150 volts for 3 h followed by autoradiography. All experiments were repeated at least three times. Where appropriate, results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was assessed by Student'st test. Footprint region V is located ∼150 bp downstream from a major transcription initiation site in exon 1 (initiation site 3 (11Adamo M.L. Ben-Hur H. LeRoith D. Roberts Jr., C.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 176: 887-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar)) and contains both an AT-rich sequence and an adjacent GC-rich element that is recognized by Sp1 (TableI and Ref. 14Zhu J.L. Pao C.-I Kaytor E.N. Phillips L.S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2000; 164: 205-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Gel shift studies with hepatic nuclear extracts and a wild type region V probe (wtV, Table I) revealed three complexes, B1, B2, and B3 (Fig. 1A,lane 1); we previously demonstrated that B2contains Sp1 and B3 contains Sp3 and that both interact with the GC-rich element (14Zhu J.L. Pao C.-I Kaytor E.N. Phillips L.S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2000; 164: 205-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). B1 contains IRBP, an insulin-responsive binding protein(s) that is distinct from Sp1 and binds to the AT-rich element (23Kaytor E.N. Zhu J.L. Pao C.-I Phillips L.S. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 1041-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To investigate the functional importance of the AT-rich sequence, we conducted gel shift analyses using a region V probe with a 4-bp mutation in the AT-rich region (VmAT, Table I). This mutation completely abolished B1binding and greatly reduced interactions with Sp1 and Sp3 (Fig.1A, lane 2). Since Sp1 and Sp3 interact directly with the GC-rich element, these observations provided the first evidence that Sp1 and Sp3 binding depends in part on either (a) the presence of neighboring DNA sequence elements, and/or (b) the presence of IRBP, presumably bound to the neighboring AT-rich element. As a separate method of evaluating interactions involving the AT-rich element, we performed gel shift experiments in which the probe was treated with berenil before the addition of nuclear extracts. Berenil binds in a non-intercalative fashion to AT-rich stretches of DNA that are at least 4–6 bp long and blocks interactions of proteins with such elements (27Gresch N. Pullman B.A Mol. Pharmacol. 1984; 25: 452-458PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1B, berenil almost completely prevented the binding of all three major complexes, indicating the importance of the AT-rich element not only for interactions with IRBP (in B1), but apparently also with Sp1 and Sp3. To determine whether the AT-rich element might play a direct role in Sp1 binding to region V, we used rhSp1 in gel shift studies. Although rhSp1 showed a relatively strong interaction with the wtV probe, binding to the VmAT probe was markedly reduced (Fig.2A, lanes 1 and2), and no binding was observed with a control region V probe mutated at the Sp1 site (VmSp1, lane 3). Consistent with this finding, incubation of the wtV probe with berenil before the addition of rhSp1 also resulted in diminished binding (Fig.2B). Mutation of the AT-rich element blunted the effect of berenil on Sp1 binding to region V, as seen with control probes containing the consensus Sp1 site but a mutated AT-rich element (VmATcSp1 in Table I, data not shown). Thus, the AT-rich site is critical not only for interactions with IRBP (in B1) but also for efficient binding of Sp1. We then evaluated the importance of the AT-rich element for Sp1 transactivation via region V in vivo. CHO cells were co-transfected with reporter constructs containing three copies of the wtV, VmAT, and VmSp1 sequences (Table I) along with an expression vector containing Sp1 and the appropriate empty vector controls. The wtV reporter exhibited 2-fold stimulation by Sp1, and the VmSp1 reporter displayed no stimulation, as expected (Fig.3A). However, the VmAT reporter resulted in reduced activation by Sp1 (21% less than the wild type reporter, p < 0.003). In other experiments, CHO cells were treated with berenil after transfection. Blocking AT-rich sequences in this manner also prevented activation of the wtV reporter by Sp1 (Fig. 3B). Taken together, these findings indicate that the AT-rich site is critical for Sp1 interactions with region V both in vitro and in vivo. The presence of the AT-rich element might influence binding and activity of Sp1 either directly or via interactions with factors such as IRBP that bind to the AT-rich element. To test the hypothesis that a factor(s) binding to the AT-rich site might facilitate Sp1 binding to the adjacent GC-rich site, gel shifts were conducted using threshold quantities of either hepatic nuclear extracts, rhSp1, or both; these experiments utilized trace amounts of protein to permit observation of facilitated binding, which might have been obscured by strong bands resulting from the use of higher concentrations of either component. Although nuclear extracts alone and rhSp1 alone showed negligible binding to the wtV probe, the combination produced robust binding (Fig. 4,lanes 2–4). Consistent with the studies shown in Figs.1A and 2A, the enhanced binding was greatly reduced with the VmAT probe (Fig. 4, lanes 5–7). The enhanced complex is most likely Sp1 and not IRBP, as the VmAT probe completely eliminates IRBP binding while allowing some Sp1 to bind (Fig. 1A; Sp1 and/or IRBP binding also shown in Zhu et al. (14Zhu J.L. Pao C.-I Kaytor E.N. Phillips L.S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2000; 164: 205-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and Kaytor et al. (23Kaytor E.N. Zhu J.L. Pao C.-I Phillips L.S. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 1041-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar)). In addition, the enhanced band is supershifted by an antibody against Sp1 (data not shown). Thus, a factor(s) in hepatic nuclear extracts appears to act via the AT-rich element to facilitate Sp1 interactions with region V. The GC-rich element in IGF-I region V contains a 1-bp mutation from the consensus Sp1 site (16Briggs M.R. Kadonaga J.T. Bell S.P. Tjian R. Science. 1986; 234: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar) with a T substituted for a C (Table I). We examined binding with region V probes mutated to contain the consensus Sp1 site both with an intact AT-rich element and with a mutated AT-rich element (VcSp1 and VmATcSp1, Table I). As expected, rhSp1 interacted more strongly with the VcSp1 probe than with the wtV probe in gel shift studies (Fig.5A, lanes 2 and3). Similar to the results obtained with the wtV and VmAT probes, binding of rhSp1 to the VmATcSp1 probe mutated in the AT-rich site was weaker than binding to the VcSp1 probe with the intact AT-rich site (Fig. 5B). Although Sp1 bound more strongly to the VcSp1 probe, facilitation by a factor(s) in nuclear extracts was still observed with VcSp1 (Fig. 5C, lane 3), demonstrating that the presence of a consensus Sp1 site did not eliminate the potential of other factors to enhance Sp1 binding. Facilitation of Sp1 binding to the GC-rich element may be mediated by physical interactions of Sp1 with a factor such as IRBP that binds to the AT-rich element; such interactions could promote or stabilize Sp1 binding and action. To investigate this possibility, we performed gel shift studies with region V probes containing 2-, 5-, and 10-bp insertions between the AT-rich and GC-rich elements (V+2, V+5, and V+10, Table I). As shown in Fig.6, facilitation of Sp1 binding by a factor(s) in nuclear extracts occurred as long as the AT-rich and GC-rich sites were positioned close to their native positions with regard to the face of the DNA helix; the insertion of either 2 or 10 bp into region V did not inhibit facilitation, whereas a 5-bp insertion that introduced a 180° alteration in the relative positioning of the two sites completely abolished facilitation. The spatial relationship of the AT-rich and GC-rich elements is thus important for the interaction between the sites that occurs in vitro. The importance of the spacing between the two sites was also tested in transient transfection studies. HepG2 hepatoma cells were cotransfected with luciferase reporter plasmids containing four copies of the wtV, VcSp1, V+2, V+5, and V+10 sequences together with either an Sp1 expression plasmid or the empty vector (pPac). As shown in Fig.7, activity of both the wtV and the VcSp1 control reporters was stimulated by the Sp1 expression vector. However, although insertions of 2 or 10 bp did not affect facilitation of Sp1 binding in vitro (Fig. 6), insertion of either 2, 5, or 10 bp prevented activation by Sp1 in vivo (Fig. 7). Therefore, the spatial relationship between the two elements is even more criticalin vivo. We previously demonstrated that an insulin-responsive nuclear factor(s), IRBP, binds to region V at the AT-rich element (23Kaytor E.N. Zhu J.L. Pao C.-I Phillips L.S. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 1041-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To determine whether IRBP might be the factor that facilitates Sp1 binding, we conducted gel shift analyses using the wtV probe and threshold amounts of rhSp1 and nuclear extracts from CHO-IR cells treated with or without 10−6 m insulin for 24 h. The facilitation of Sp1 binding was ∼4-fold greater with extracts from insulin-treated cells (Fig.8, lanes 4 and 5,p < 0.04), suggesting that IRBP may be the factor that binds to the AT-rich sequence and facilitates Sp1 binding to the adjacent GC-rich element. Diabetes-related regulation of IGF-I gene transcription appears to involve region V, a DNase I footprint site located downstream from the major transcription initiation sites in exon 1 (13Pao C.-I Zhu J.-L. Robertson D.G. Lin K.W.M. Farmer P.K. Begovic S. Wu G.-J. Phillips L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24917-24923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Region V contains both a GC-rich element that is a functional Sp1 site (14Zhu J.L. Pao C.-I Kaytor E.N. Phillips L.S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2000; 164: 205-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and an AT-rich element immediately adjacent to the GC-rich element. Our examination of insulin-mediated IGF-I expression led to the detection of IRBP, an insulin-responsive complex that binds to the AT-rich element (23Kaytor E.N. Zhu J.L. Pao C.-I Phillips L.S. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 1041-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The present studies show that binding of hepatic nuclear extracts to region V probes is diminished either by mutations in the AT-rich element or by the addition of berenil, which blocks DNA-protein interactions involving AT-rich sequences. The AT-site mutations and berenil also reduce both binding of recombinant Sp1 to region V probesin vitro and the ability of Sp1 to transactivate IGF-I reporter constructs in vivo. Sp1 binding to region V is therefore at least partially dependent on the presence of the AT-rich element. The requirement of neighboring sequences to facilitate transcription factor binding is well recognized (28Fry C.J. Farnham P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29583-29586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). However, our studies of facilitation of Sp1 binding by nuclear extracts indicate that the presence of the AT-rich element may also be important in permitting binding of a nuclear factor(s) such as IRBP, which in turn enhances Sp1 binding. The possibility of physical interaction between Sp1 and a factor such as IRBP was shown by the spatial dependence of facilitation; insertion of 5 bp between the AT-rich and GC-rich elements abolished facilitation, but facilitation persisted with 2- and 10-bp insertions that would maintain the AT-rich and GC-rich elements on the same side of the DNA helix. Since the insertion of 2, 5, or 10 additional base pairs between the AT-rich and GC-rich sequences abrogated the ability of Sp1 to activate reporter constructs in vivo, it is likely that facilitation of Sp1 activation or recruitment of nuclear factors that contribute to the transcriptional machinery may have more stringent requirements than facilitation of Sp1 DNA binding alone. Furthermore, a physical interaction between Sp1 and a factor such as IRBP is supported by the observation that facilitation of Sp1 binding to region V is greater with nuclear extracts from insulin-treated cells than with extracts from untreated cells. Sp1 has been implicated in the expression of a large number of genes, most often in conjunction with other transcription factors that provide specificity. For example, stimulation of gene transcription by the sterol response element binding protein, which mediates the expression of a number of genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis and uptake and fatty acid synthesis (reviewed in Ref. 29Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2908) Google Scholar), often requires the presence of additional factors, including Sp1 (30Sanchez H.B. Yieh L.

Chem. 2000; 275: 4726-4733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In addition, Sp1 has been shown to cooperate with a plethora of other transcription factors such as AP1, E2F, c-Jun, NF-Y, Elk-1, and the Smad proteins to control the expression of a diverse group of genes (19Tsai E.Y. Falvo J.V. Tsytsykova A.V. Barczak A.K. Reimold A.M. Glimcher L.H. Fenton M.J. Gordon D.C. Dunn I.F. Goldfeld A.E. Mol. Cell.

A. 2000; 97: 10406-10411Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Thus, Sp1 appears to have a wide role as a cofactor in the transcriptional regulation of many genes; our data support the hypothesis that IGF-I is another example of such a gene. The consensus binding site for Sp1 consists of the sequence 5′-CCGCCC-3′ (16Briggs M.R. Kadonaga J.T. Bell S.P. Tjian R. Science. 1986; 234: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar), whereas the Sp1 binding site within region V contains the sequence 5′-CTGCCC-3′. We hypothesize that this 1-bp difference from the consensus site may render Sp1 binding and activity more dependent on the presence of a factor(s) such as IRBP, which binds to the neighboring AT-rich element; when insulin levels are high, IRBP binding at the AT-rich element could promote interactions with Sp1 and stimulate IGF-I expression. Consistent with our hypothesis, we observed greater binding of Sp1 to a region V probe containing a consensus Sp1 site as compared with the wild type sequence, and although facilitation of Sp1 binding by nuclear extracts was still observed with the VcSp1 probe, facilitation was less that with the wtV probe. It is possible that nuclear extracts could facilitate Sp1 binding by altering the status of Sp1 phosphorylation. Depending on the gene, phosphorylation can result in either increased or decreased binding to DNA probes (35Leggett R.W. Armstrong S.A. Barry D. Mueller C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25879-25884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 36Armstrong S.A. Barry D.A. Leggett R.W. Mueller C.R. J. Biol.

To test the possibility that facilitation in the present studies reflects changes in Sp1 phosphorylation, we conducted gel shift studies using nuclear extracts or rhSp1 treated with either alkaline phosphatase or the phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid. Since we were unable to demonstrate a consistent effect of either phosphorylation or dephosphorylation on the binding of Sp1 to region V (data not shown), it is unlikely that the potential role of insulin in modulating Sp1 effects on IGF-I transcription involves changes in Sp1 phosphorylation status. However, since some (weaker) facilitation was observed with probes lacking the AT-rich element (Fig. 4), it remains possible that some facilitation may occur via protein-protein interactions and/or post-translational modifications that do not involve binding to the AT-rich element. Although our data are suggestive, we do not know whether the facilitation of Sp1 binding to region V is due to IRBP or instead reflects the contributions of another factor. However, binding experiments showing that nuclear extracts from CHO-IR cells treated with 10−6 m insulin for 24 h provide greater facilitation than nuclear extracts from untreated cells (Fig.8) are operationally consistent with a role for IRBP. The observation of insulin-responsive facilitation combined with insulin-regulated IGF-I transcription and IRBP binding to region V support the need for identification of IRBP for future mechanistic studies."

Nature. 1998; 391: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar) reveals a bipartite structure with distinct C-terminal polymerase and N-terminal exonuclease domains (Fig.1). Most polymerases of the polymerase I family have a similar bipartite architecture (8Ollis D.L. Brick P. Hamlin R. Xuong N.G. Steitz T.A.

A “right hand” with distinct fingers, palm, and thumb subdomains forms a distinct DNA-binding groove that leads to the polymerase active site (13Steitz T.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 31-38Crossref Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The fingers, palm, and thumb grip the primer-template by a number of direct and water-mediated contacts mainly to the phosphodiester backbone of DNA such that the 3′-end of the primer strand is positioned next to the nucleotide-binding site. The 3′-5′ exonuclease activity on ssDNA1 and dsDNA serves to excise mismatches during processive DNA synthesis (14Jovin T.M. Englund P.T. Bertsch L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 2996-3008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Hori K. Mark D.F. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 11598-11604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The polymerase and the exonuclease active sites are ∼35 Å apart. Although the error frequency during base selection by the polymerase activity occurs at the low rate of one misincorporation per 106 turnovers, the 3′-5′ proofreading activity further reduces the error frequency by 10–200-fold depending on the method of measurement (16Kunkel T.A. Patel S.S. Johnson K.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6830-6834Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 17Wong I. Patel S.S. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 526-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). It is believed that the 3′-5′ exonuclease activity maximizes its contribution to replication fidelity by minimal hydrolysis of correctly base paired DNA (18Donlin M.J. Patel S.S. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 538-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The pre-steady-state kinetic pathways for the polymerization and the exonuclease reactions have been described in detail for T7 DNA polymerase (17Wong I. Patel S.S. Johnson K.A.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10670-10674Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). An equilibrium exists between DNA binding to the polymerase or exonuclease active site, with binding to the polymerase site being thermodynamically more favored (18Donlin M.J. Patel S.S. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 538-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Any process that slows the rate of the elongation reaction, for example a mismatch, allows time for the transfer of DNA to the exonuclease active site (17Wong I. Patel S.S. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 526-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 25Carver T.E. Hochstrasser R.A. Millar D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10670-10674Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The data also suggest that DNA is transferred intramolecularly in both directions between the polymerase and exonuclease sites without dissociating from the enzyme. However, the mechanisms that underlie the occupancy of DNA in the polymerase versus the exonuclease site are not well understood. Residues that contact DNA may be expected to govern the partitioning of DNA between the two active sites. The crystal structure of T7 DNA polymerase reveals a putative hydrogen bond between the C-terminal residue His704 of gene 5 protein and an oxygen atom on the penultimate phosphate diester of the primer strand (Fig. 1). This C-terminal residue is conserved in T7 DNA polymerase (His704) and in E. coli DNA polymerase I (His928). In the DNA polymerases from Bacillus stearothermophilus (26Kiefer J.R. Mao C. Hansen C.J.

Nature. 1996; 382: 278-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), the homologous residues are Lys876 and Lys832, respectively. To probe the role of this interaction with the 3′-OH primer terminus, His704 of T7 DNA polymerase was substituted with alanine. The loss of this interaction could result either in reduced affinity of the polymerase for the primer-template or in reduced affinity for just the primer strand. In this report, we show that the C-terminal histidine of T7 DNA polymerase plays a critical role in orienting the primer terminus in position for catalysis and possibly in the controlled shuttling of DNA between the polymerase and exonuclease sites. M13 mGP1-2 is a 9950-nt derivative of vector M13 mp8 containing an insert of phage T7 DNA (31Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4767-4771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1687) Google Scholar). The 24-nt M13 sequencing primer (−47) (5′-CGCCAGGGTTTTCCCAGTCACGAC-3′) and oligonucleotides forin vitro mutagenesis were from Oligos Etc. Activated calf thymus DNA (Type XV) was obtained from Sigma. Poly(dA)280was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and oligo(dT)22 was obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies. Poly(dA)280 and oligo(dT)22 were dissolved in a 1:1 molar ratio (20 μm) in 40 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, and 50 mm NaCl and annealed by heating to 95 °C for 5 min, followed by slowly cooling to room temperature. The 24-nt M13 sequencing primer and M13 mGP1-2 DNA were mixed in a 1:1 molar ratio (100 nm) and annealed using the same protocol. Oligonucleotide concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically. DNA concentrations are expressed in terms of primer 3′-ends. E. coli strains C600 and HMS174 are from the laboratory collection.E. coli HMS174 (DE3)/pLysS cells are from Novagen. Wild-type bacteriophage T7 and mutant T7Δ5 (gene 5 deletion) phage are from the laboratory collection. Plasmid pGP5-3 contains T7 gene 5 under the control of the T7 RNA polymerase promotor Φ10 (2Tabor S. Huber H.E. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16212-16223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid pGP5-5,7A contains T7 gene 5 in which two exonuclease active site residues of gene 5 (Asp5 and Glu7) have been substituted with alanine. Plasmid pT7-7 is the parent vector of pGP5-3 missing the GP5 insert. Growth and manipulation of bacteriophage T7 and E. coli were performed as described (32Tabor S. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6447-6458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Studier F.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 94: 283-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Plasmid pGP5-H704A was constructed using standard polymerase chain reaction and cloning techniques. Two oligonucleotide primers, (5′-CGGGATCCTCAGCCGCAAATCGCCCAATTA-3′) and (5′-CCGTTGGTGCCGGCAAAGAGCGCGG-3′) were used to amplify 340 base pairs of the T7 DNA sequence containing His704. The codon in bold type corresponds to the amino acid alteration. Polymerase chain reaction-generated fragments were digested with BamHI andPshAI and then cloned into the PshAI andBglII sites of plasmid pGP5-3. Plasmid pGP5-H704A contains the genetically altered gene 5 that encodes gp5-H704A under control of the T7 Φ10 promotor. Plasmid pGP5-H704A was digested with restriction enzymes HindIII and StyI, and the resulting fragment was ligated into the HindIII and StyI site of pGP5-5,7A giving rise to pGP5-H704A-5,7 A. The identity of the clones was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Gene 5 proteins were overproduced from E. coli HMS174 (DE3)/pLysS cells carrying plasmids. The 1:1 complex of polymerase and thioredoxin was purified to apparent homogeneity as described (2Tabor S. Huber H.E. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16212-16223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (34Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) and were confirmed by amino acid analysis. Restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs. Unlabeled nucleotides (high pressure liquid chromatography grade) were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. [3H]dTTP (3000 Ci/mmol) was obtained fromAmersham Pharmacia Biotech and diluted with dTTP to ∼2 cpm/pmol. Methyl-[3H]thymidine (25 Ci/mmol) and [α-32P]dTTP (3000 Ci/mmol) were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Plating efficiencies of wild-type and Δ5 T7 phage were measured on E. coli C600 cells harboring either the plasmid pT7-7, pGP5-3, or pGP5-H704A. The cells were grown to a density of 2 × 108 cells/ml. Dilutions of phage solutions were mixed with 0.5 ml of cells, 3 ml of top agar (1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast, 0.5% NaCl, 0.7% agar, pH 7.0) and ampicillin (200 μg) and plated on TB (1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast, 0.5% NaCl, 1.5% agar, pH 7.0) plates. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 5 h before being analyzed for plaques. Thymidine incorporation assays were carried out at 30 °C (35Saito H. Richardson C.C. J. Virol. 1981; 37: 343-351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli C600 cells harboring plasmid pGP5-3 or pGP5-H704A were grown to a density of 3 × 108 cells/ml in Davis medium (0.7% potassium diphosphate, 2% potassium monophosphate, 0.05% sodium citrate, 0.01% magnesium sulfate, 0.1% ammonium sulfate) supplemented with glucose, thiamine, casamino acids, and ampicillin (80 μg/ml). The cells were infected with either wild-type T7 phage or T7 phage containing a deletion of gene 5 (Δ5 phage) at a multiplicity of infection of ∼5 (35Saito H. Richardson C.C. J. Virol. 1981; 37: 343-351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At indicated time intervals, 200 μl of the samples were removed, and [3H]thymidine was added to a final concentration of 50 μCi/ml. Radioactive labeling was terminated after 90 s by the addition of 3 ml of ice-cold 0.3 ntrichloroacetic acid. Acid-insoluble radioactivity was collected via filtration on glass microfiber filters and washed three times with 1m HCl (3 ml) and twice with ethanol (3 ml). The acid insoluble radioactivity was measured using a scintillation counter. The reaction mixtures (50 μl) with primed M13 mGP1-2 DNA contained 40 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 50 mm NaCl, 20 nm M13 DNA annealed to a 24-nt oligonucleotide, 500 μm each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and [3H]dTTP (2 cpm/pmol), 50 μg/ml BSA, and 0.3 nm DNA polymerase. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for the indicated periods of time. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 10 μl of 0.5 m EDTA, pH 7.5. The incorporation of [3H]dTMP was measured on DE81 filter discs as described (20Bryant F.R. Johnson K.A. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 3537-3546Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). To measure a single round of DNA synthesis, (dA)280·(dT)22 was used as a primer-template, and the reactions were carried out at 22 °C as described (6Huber H.E. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16224-16232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The DNA polymerase was preincubated with the primer-template in the absence of Mg2+ and dTTP for 5 min. The reactions were initiated by the addition of Mg2+, dTTP, and challenger DNA to trap any free polymerase. The aliquots were withdrawn at the indicated times and quenched with a final concentration of 100 mm EDTA. The control reactions to measure background incorporation by polymerase not trapped by challenger DNA were carried out by adding challenger DNA to the preincubation mix. This background reaction was subtracted wherever applicable. The preincubation mixture (30 μl) contained 270 nm poly(dA)280·oligo(dT)22 and 40 nm DNA polymerase. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 25 mm MgCl2, 0.75 mm[3H]dTTP (2 cpm/pmol), and 10 μg calf thymus DNA in 20 μl. Final concentrations were 160 nmpoly(dA)280·oligo(dT)22, 0.3 mm[3H]dTTP, 25 nm DNA polymerase, 10 mm MgCl2, and 200 μg/ml calf thymus DNA. All reaction mixtures also contained 40 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 5 mm DTT, 50 mm NaCl, and 50 μg/ml BSA. The 3′-5′ exonuclease activity was measured using uniformly 3H-labeled M13 ssDNA or dsDNA. This substrate was prepared by annealing the 24-nt oligonucleotide to M13 mGP1-2 DNA and then extending the primer in a reaction mixture (300 μl) that contained 30 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 50 mm NaCl, 50 μm each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and [3H]dTTP (3000 Ci/mmol), and 200 nm T7 DNA polymerase. After incubation at 37 °C for 8 min, the DNA was extracted with an equal volume of buffer-saturated phenol, pH 8.0:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:24:1), and the labeled DNA was purified through a Sepharose CL-6B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column.3H-Labeled M13 mGP1-2 ssDNA was prepared by alkali denaturation of 3H-labeled dsDNA by treatment with 50 mm NaOH at 20 °C for 15 min, followed by neutralization with HCl. M13 3H-labeled ssDNA was used immediately.3H-labeled M13 dsDNA was stored at 4 °C. The reaction mixtures for exonuclease assays (100 μl) contained 40 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 50 mm NaCl, 1 nmol (in terms of total nucleotides) [3H]-labeled M13 mGP1-2 ssDNA or dsDNA, and (0.06–6 nm) DNA polymerase. After incubation at 37 °C for 10 min, the reaction was quenched by the addition of 30 μl of BSA (10 mg/ml) and 30 μl of trichloroacetic acid (100% w/v). After incubation at 0 °C for 15 min, precipitated DNA was collected by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 min. The acid-soluble radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting in Ultra fluor (Packard). One unit of exonuclease activity catalyzes the release of 1 pmol of total nucleotides into an acid-soluble form in 1 min. The DNA used for processivity assays was a 5′ 32P-labeled 24-nt primer annealed to M13 mGP1-2 ssDNA as described (2Tabor S. Huber H.E. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16212-16223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction mixture (22.5 μl) contained 40 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 50 mm NaCl, 500 μm each of dTTP, dATP, dGTP, and dCTP, and 8 nm primer-template. This mixture was preincubated at 37 °C for 3 min, and the reaction was started by the addition of 2.5 μl of T7 DNA polymerase. Final concentration of the polymerase was 0.3 nm. After the indicated times, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 5 μl of stop solution that contained 40% sucrose, 20 mm EDTA, and 0.05% bromphenol blue. The reaction mixtures were subjected to electrophoresis on a 0.6% agarose gel in a buffer containing 100 mm Tris borate, pH 8.3, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.06 μg/ml ethidium bromide. The gels were dried and autoradiographed. At subsaturating concentrations of ethidium bromide, nicked M13 dsDNA has lower electrophoretic mobility than M13 ssDNA annealed to a 24-nt oligonucleotide. The reaction mixture for turnover assays was essentially the same as for polymerase assays with primed M13 mGP1-2 DNA. The concentrations of wild-type T7 DNA polymerase and gp5-H704A were 2 and 4 nm, respectively. The incorporation of [α-32P]dTMP into the primer strand was measured as described for polymerase assays. The amount of [α-32P]dTMP obtained upon exonucleolytic hydrolysis by the enzyme was quantified by TLC. An aliquot of the reaction mixture was applied to a polyethyleneimine plate (JT Baker) prewashed with distilled water. The thin layer plate was developed with 0.6m LiCl in 1 m formic acid. The amount of [α-32P]dTMP formed was measured using phosphorus imaging analysis with a Fuji BAS 1000 bio-imaging analyzer. The half-life of a preformed polymerase-DNA complex was determined by preincubating the polymerase with poly(dA)280·oligo(dT)22 and adding challenger DNA at time 0. After varying periods of time (5–60 s), the polymerase reaction was started by the addition of Mg2+ and dTTP and stopped after 30 s by the addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 100 mm. Final concentrations of all of the reagents were identical to those used in the polymerase assay with poly(dA)280·oligo(dT)22. Assays to determine Km were carried out at 22 °C with poly(dA)280·oligo(dT)22. A series of 10 concentrations of dTTP were used to bracket the Kmvalue. All reaction mixtures contained 40 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 50 mm NaCl, 160 nmpoly(dA)280·oligo(dT)22 and varying amounts (5–800 μm) of [3H]dTTP (2 cpm/pmol). The reactions were initiated by the addition of polymerase diluted with BSA (final concentrations of 5 nm DNA polymerase and 50 μg/ml BSA) and stopped after 30 s by the addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 100 mm. Dissociation constants for polymerase-DNA complexes were determined for a single processive cycle of DNA synthesis using calf thymus DNA as a trap (6Huber H.E. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16224-16232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The preincubation mixture (30 μl) contained 42–660 nm poly(dA)280·oligo(dT)22 and 40 nm DNA polymerase. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 20 μl of 25 mm MgCl2, 0.75 mm [3H]dTTP (2 cpm/pmol), and 10 μg calf thymus DNA. Final concentrations were 25–400 nmpoly(dA)280·oligo(dT)22, 0.3 mm[3H]dTTP, 25 nm DNA polymerase, 10 mm MgCl2, and 200 μg/ml calf thymus DNA. All reaction mixtures also contained 40 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 5 mm DTT, 50 mm NaCl, and 50 μg/ml BSA. The data were fit by nonlinear regression (Enzyme Kinetics, version 1.4). To ascertain the role of the C-terminal histidine in T7 DNA polymerase, a gene 5 mutant was constructed in which histidine 704 was replaced with alanine (gp5-H704A). The effect of the genetically altered gene 5 protein on the growth of T7 phage was tested (TableI). When gp5-H704A is produced from a plasmid, it is unable to support the growth of T7 phage in which the wild-type gene 5 has been deleted (T7Δ5). T7Δ5 phage are dependent on the expression of plasmid encoded gene 5 protein for viability. Furthermore, gp5-H704A inhibits the growth of wild-type T7 phage that is expressing the wild-type gene 5. In contrast, production of wild-type gene 5 protein from a plasmid supports the growth of T7Δ5 phage and has no effect on the growth of on wild-type T7 phage. Thus, the histidine to alanine substitution is dominant lethal for T7 phage growth.Table IAbility of gene 5 plasmids to complement T7 phage growthPlasmidaPlasmid pGP5–3 contains T7 gene 5 under the control of the T7 RNA polymerase promotor φ10, pGP5-H704A contains T7 gene 5 with the H704A codon substitution, and pT7-7 is the parent vector of pGP5-3 missing the gene 5 insert.MutationEfficiency of platingT7Δ5T7 wtNo Plasmid<10−61pT7-7No gene 5<10−61pGP5-3Wild type11pGP5-H704AH704A<10−6<10−6Efficiency of plating of wild-type and Δ5 T7 phage on E. coli C600 was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” E. coli C600 cells harboring the indicated plasmids were infected with wild-type or T7 Δ5 phage.

Open table in a new tab Efficiency of plating of wild-type and Δ5 T7 phage on E. coli C600 was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” E. coli C600 cells harboring the indicated plasmids were infected with wild-type or T7 Δ5 phage. The efficiency of plating is calculated by dividing the number of plaque forming units observed when plated on cells containing the indicated plasmid by the number of plaque forming units on pGP5–3 and represents an average of three experiments. The rates of in vivo DNA synthesis were measured by monitoring the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA in phage-infected cells (Fig.2). E. coli C600 cells harboring a plasmid (pGP5-3 or pGP5-H704A) were infected with either T7Δ5 phage (Fig. 2 A) or wild-type T7 phage (Fig.2 B). T7 DNA synthesis in infected cells starts ∼10 min after infection, presumably after the shut down of host DNA synthesis (33Studier F.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 94: 283-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 A shows a plot of the incorporation of [3H]thymidine as a function of time upon infection with T7Δ5 phage. When wild-type gene 5 protein is produced from the plasmid, DNA synthesis starts to increase 10 min after infection and continues to increase up to 30 min after infection. In contrast, when gp5-H704A is produced from the plasmid, DNA synthesis is strongly inhibited 10 min after infection with T7Δ5 phage. Even more striking is the kinetics of DNA synthesis upon infection with wild-type T7 phage (Fig. 2 B). With wild-type gene 5 protein, T7 DNA synthesis starts 10 min after infection, reaching a maximum at 40 min after infection. In contrast, with gp5-H704A, DNA synthesis starts to decrease immediately upon infection. These data indicate that the altered protein, gp5-H704A, cannot restore DNA synthesis in T7Δ5 phage-infected cells, and furthermore, gp5-H704A inhibits DNA synthesis in wild-type T7 phage-infected cells. To determine how the mutation in gene 5 leads to decreased DNA synthesis in vivo, gp5-H704A was overproduced, purified, and characterized biochemically. Initially, gp5-H704A was compared with wild-type T7 DNA polymerase by measuring the rate of polymerization of nucleotides. Initial rates of DNA synthesis with purified enzymes were measured by following the incorporation of [3H]dTMP into DNA using primed M13 ssDNA (Fig. 3) or poly(dA)280·oligo(dT)22 (Fig.4) as primer-templates. The reactions were carried out under conditions of excess nucleotides and DNA. The steady-state rate constant for polymerization (kpol) was determined by dividing the rate of incorporation of nucleotides by the polymerase concentration. The polymerase activity has been expressed in terms ofkpol. Gp5-H704A has 8-fold lower polymerase activity (kpol = 30 s−1) than the wild-type polymerase (kpol = 240 s−1) on M13 ssDNA (Fig. 3). With poly(dA)280·oligo(dT)22, the polymerase activity of gp5-H704A (kpol = 60 s−1) is 3-fold lower than of the wild-type polymerase (kpol = ∼200 s−1) (Fig.4 A). One possible explanation of the lower rate of DNA synthesis on the long M13 DNA template relative to that observed on the shorter poly(dA)280·oligo(dT)22 template is that gp5-H704A is less processive.Figure 4Polymerase assays with preformed polymerase-poly(dA)280·oligo(dT)22 complexes in the presence of challenger DNA.

https://openalex.org/W1992518134,"The G protein Gbetagamma subunit complex stimulates effectors by direct interactions utilizing extensive Gbeta regions over the surface of its propeller structure that faces the Galpha subunit. Our previous experiments have shown the resolved functions of signal transfer and general binding for Gbeta regions involved in stimulation of the effector phospholipase C-beta2, PLC-beta2, within the region Gbeta-(86-135), which comprises three beta strands arranged in a structurally contiguous fashion (Buck, E., Li, J., Chen, Y., Weng, G., Sacarlata, S., and Iyengar, R. (1999) Science 283, 1332-1335). This raises an important question as to why mutagenesis studies indicate that an extensive set of sites all over the Gbeta propeller structure and outside the 86-135 region are involved in Gbeta regulation of PLC-beta2. Using peptides to define functions of these Gbeta regions, we find that Gbeta signaling to PLC-beta2 relies on a collection of modular signal transfer and general binding units, each with lower apparent affinity relative to Gbetagamma-PLC interactions. Gbeta-(42-54) functions as a signal transfer region, Gbeta-(228-249) and Gbeta-(321-340) function in general binding, and Gbeta-(64-84) and Gbeta-(300-313) seem to play a structural role rather than a direct contact with the effector. A substitution within the Gbeta-(42-54) signal transfer region that increases the K(act) of this peptide for PLC-beta2 is accompanied by an increase in the observed maximal extent of signal transfer. We conclude that the lower K(act) for individual signal transfer regions may result in a decrease in the maximal effect of signal transfer. The spatial resolution of the signal transfer and general binding regions over a wide surface of Gbeta allow geometrical constraints to achieve specificity even with relatively low affinity interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2125177039,"The chromatin architecture of a promoter is an important determinant of its transcriptional response. For most target genes, the thyroid hormone receptor (TR) activates gene expression in response to thyroid hormone (T3). In contrast, the thyroid-stimulating hormone α-subunit (TSHα) gene promoter is down-regulated by TR in the presence of T3. Here we utilize the capacity for the Xenopus oocyte to chromatinize exogenous nuclear- injected DNA to analyze the chromatin architecture of the TSHα promoter and how this changes upon TR-mediated regulation. Interestingly, in the oocyte, the TSHα promoter was positively regulated by T3. In the inactive state, the promoter contained six loosely positioned nucleosomes. The addition of TR/retinoid X receptor together had no effect on the chromatin structure, but the inclusion of T3 induced strong positioning of a dinucleosome in the TSHα proximal promoter that was bordered by regions that were hypersensitive to cleavage by methidiumpropyl EDTA. We identified a novel thyroid response element that coincided with the proximal hypersensitive region. Furthermore, we examined the consequences of mutations in TR that impaired coactivator recruitment. In a comparison with the Xenopus TRβA promoter, we found that the effects of these mutations on transactivation and chromatin remodeling were significantly more severe on the TSHα promoter."
https://openalex.org/W2012758596,"In mammalian cells, DNA replication proceeds according to a precise temporal order during the S phase, but how this program is controlled remains poorly understood. We analyzed the replication-dependent bromodeoxyuridine banding of chromosomes in Chinese hamster cells treated with the spindle poison nocodazole. In these cells, nocodazole induces a transient mitotic arrest, followed by DNA re-replication without intervening cell division. Nuclear fragmentation is often observed in tetraploid derivatives, and previous studies suggest that replication timing of chromosomes could be affected when they are segregated into different micronuclei. Here we show that the onset of replication is frequently asynchronous on individual chromosomes during the re-replication process. Moreover, fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis revealed that replication synchrony is equally altered in fragmented and non-fragmented nuclei, indicating that asynchronous onset of replication is not dependent on physical separation of the chromosomes into isolated compartments. We also show that the ordered program of replication is always preserved along individual chromosomes. Our results demonstrate that the onset of replication of individual chromosomes in the same nuclear compartment can be uncoupled from the time of S-phase entry and from the programmed replication of chromosome sub-domains, revealing that multi-level controls contribute to establish replication timing in mammalian cells.

These and other studies performed with different eukaryotic cells revealed that initiation of replication depends both on the sequential recruitment of specific factors on replication origins and on the activity of trans-acting protein kinases (11Takisawa H. Mimura S. Kubota Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 690-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms that regulate the establishment of early and late origins are still poorly understood. Interestingly, it has been demonstrated that the programming of one late replication origin occurs during the G1 phase between mitosis and START (12Raghuraman M.K. Brewer B.J. Fangman W.L. Science. 1997; 276: 806-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In good agreement with this latter finding,ex vivo analysis of DNA replication of isolated Chinese hamster nuclei introduced in Xenopus egg extracts suggested that replication timing is determined during early G1 in mammalian cells, at a stage called the “timing decision point,” after completion of the positioning of chromosomal domains within the nucleus (13Dimitrova D.S. Gilbert D.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 983-993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). However, some evidence indicates that early and late replicating chromosomal domains are unaffected in abnormal nuclear structures, such as micronuclei (2Ferreira J. Paolella G. Ramos C. Lamond A.I. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1597-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), or during chromosome repositioning that occurs when quiescent human cells re-enter the cell cycle (14Bridger J.M. Boyle S. Kill I.R. Bickmore W.A. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 149-152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar).Recent work suggested that a passage through the S and M phases plays a key role in correct repositioning of chromosomes during the next interphase (14Bridger J.M. Boyle S. Kill I.R. Bickmore W.A. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 149-152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Interestingly, treatment with spindle poisons affected the synchrony of replication of individual chromosomes (15Stubblefield E. Symp. Int. Soc. Cell Biol. 1964; 3: 223-248Google Scholar). After prolonged metaphase block, mammalian cells progressively exit mitosis without an intervening cell division, a phenomenon called adaptation or mitotic slippage, giving rise to tetraploid derivatives (16Andreassen P.R. Margolis R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 789-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 17Khan S.H. Wahl G.M. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 396-401PubMed Google Scholar, 18Kung A.L. Sherwood S.W.

Mitotic slippage is often accompanied by abnormal nuclear budding and micro-nucleation (15Stubblefield E. Symp. Int. Soc. Cell Biol. 1964; 3: 223-248Google Scholar, 24Fournier R.E.K. Ruddle F.H.

Our study was aimed to investigate the consequences of nuclear alteration on the temporal programming of chromosome duplication of mammalian cells upon treatment with the spindle poison nocodazole.We studied the timing of replication in nocodazole-treated and untreated cells of the Chinese hamster line GMA32, which are permissive for S-phase entry after mitotic slippage. We demonstrate that the synchrony of the onset of replication on different chromosomes is impaired during the reduplication process and that this phenomenon is not dependent on the segregation of chromosomes into different micronuclei. We show that chromosomes that tend to cluster after adaptation also tend to maintain replication synchrony, suggesting a correlation between nuclear spatial organization and replication timing control. Nevertheless, the temporal program of replication of chromosomal sub-regions is unaltered. Besides providing new evidence that DNA replication timing can be affected by changes in the general structure of the nucleus, we identify a phenotype characterized by a stochastic onset of replication from chromosome to chromosome within a cell, whereas the relative order of replication of chromosomal sub-domains remains unaffected.DISCUSSIONThe establishment of the DNA replication timing is a complex phenomenon at least partially correlated to the positioning of the chromosomal domains in the nuclei of mammalian cells (13Dimitrova D.S. Gilbert D.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 983-993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Here we have studied Chinese hamster cells in which the nuclear organization has been perturbed by treatment with nocodazole, a well known spindle poison. This category of drugs impairs the progression of cells through mitosis, but mammalian cells gradually overcome the block and enter G1, a process often accompanied by nuclear distortion or fragmentation. Although normal cells fail to enter S phase after mitotic slippage, most transformed and immortalized cells, including cells of the GMA32 line, do undergo DNA replication (Fig. 1). Analysis of the tetraploid or slightly hypo-tetraploid metaphase plates resulting from re-replication shows that during this S phase all chromosomes of cells that reach mitosis are completely re-replicated (Fig. 6), but the patterns of replication-dependent chromosome banding observed in nocodazole-treated cells indicate that various subsets of chromosomes replicate asynchronously (Fig. 2). Moreover, the observed asynchrony results from an uncoupled onset of replication on different chromosomes. Indeed, in some experiments, nocodazole-treated cells were pulse-labeled with BrdUrd during a time lapse covering the G1/S border after mitotic slippage, and a few completely unlabeled chromosomes were observed in metaphase plates (Fig. 2d). However, we cannot rule out the possibility that some variations in the replication rate accompany the chromosome asynchrony. In contrast, the temporal order of replication of syntenic sequences is not affected, since no abnormalities were detected when the banding patterns of chromosomes from nocodazole-treated cells were compared with those of untreated control cells. Significantly, a normal temporal program of replication is maintained also in the chromosomes that replicate asynchronously (Fig.5).The existence of structural relationships between nuclear organization and the replication process has been often described (9DePamphilis M.L. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 129: 186-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 10Leonhardt H. Rahn H.P. Cardoso M.C. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1999; 9: 345-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In our work, FISH experiments focusing on the AMPD2 and P3C3 loci indicated that the four copies of chromosome 1 distribute differently in the interphase nuclei of cells of a long established tetraploid line and of diploid cells treated with nocodazole and allowed to undergo a second S phase. Only in this latter case, the homologues tend to cluster two by two (Fig. 3, b–f), and the replication of the AMPD2 locus was frequently altered in pairs of clustered chromosomes (Fig. 3, d and e). Analysis of the replication-dependent banding of pairs of asynchronous 1A and 1B chromosomes revealed that sister chromosomes shared the very same replication pattern, whereas non-sister homologues are often replicated asynchronously (Fig. 5B, b andc). Consistently, tetraploid cells contain a single pair of sister chromosomes X that replicate synchronously (Fig. 5B,a–c). Hence, it is tempting to assume that sister chromatids, from which the sister chromosomes derive, remained close to each other in interphase, giving rise to the observed clustering of homologues two by two. Such an absence of sister chromatid disjunction is easily accounted for by the nocodazole-induced disruption of the mitotic spindle (41Skibbens R.V. Hieter P. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1998; 32: 307-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that replication synchrony is preferentially preserved on chromosomes that are maintained in close proximity and suggest that nuclear organization plays an essential role to ensure a coordinated onset of replication on the different chromosomes. Asynchrony of chromosome replication was observed nearly four decades ago by Stubblefield (15Stubblefield E. Symp. Int. Soc. Cell Biol. 1964; 3: 223-248Google Scholar) after prolonged treatment with colcemid of Chinese hamster cells labeled with tritiated thymidine. He suggested that this phenomenon results from the confinement of different chromosomes in different micronuclei (15Stubblefield E. Symp. Int. Soc. Cell Biol. 1964; 3: 223-248Google Scholar, 42Ephrussi B. Weiss M.C. Dev. Biol. 1967; Suppl. 1: 136-169Google Scholar). More recently, in vitro analysis of the replication timing of pseudo-nuclei formed in Xenopus oocyte extracts upon reconstitution of a nuclear envelope around demembranated nuclei supported the confinement hypothesis (43Leno G.H. Laskey R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 557-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In this experimental system, different pseudo-nuclei replicate asynchronously, whereas individual demembranated nuclei embedded within the same nuclear envelope replicate synchronously. Asynchronous replication of chromosomes segregated in different micronuclei was also observed duringXenopus early development (44Lemaitre J.M. Geraud G. Mechali M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1159-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). On the contrary, the physical separation of two sets of chromosomes within two nuclei in mammalian heterokaryons does not correlate per se with an asynchrony of replication or of other important cell cycle events (45Rao P.N. Johnson R.T. Nature. 1970; 225: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Here we show that asynchronous replication is not limited to the chromosomes that are physically isolated into separate nuclear compartments in somatic mammalian cells. Indeed, FISH experiments indicated that this phenomenon occurs as well in cells that exhibit an apparently normal or only slightly abnormally shaped nucleus (Fig. 3). Careful analysis of normally shaped nuclei of nocodazole-treated cells reveals that they are devoid of cryptic internal compartmentalization (Fig. 4).It was repeatedly suggested that the role of the nuclear envelope with respect to the control of the DNA replication process is to modulate the concentration of positive or negative regulatory proteins involved in the onset or the progression of S phase (46Laskey R.A. Gorlich D. Madine M.A. Makkerh J.P.S. Romanowski P. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 229: 204-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 47Walter J. Sun L. Newport J. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 519-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 48Cimbora D.M. Groudine M. Cell. 2001; 104: 643-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the experimental system based on Xenopus oocytes described above (43Leno G.H. Laskey R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 557-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), synchrony of replication within each pseudo-nucleus might be favored by the high concentration of replication factors in the oocyte extract, which in turn could allow an efficient and homogenous distribution of positive regulators in the pseudo-nuclei. Yet, in mammalian nuclei replication factors are far less concentrated, and the generation of gradients throughout the nuclear volume might explain the asynchrony observed here. In this hypothesis, initiation and/or subsequent elongation at early origins on a given chromosome can be blocked until enough factors become available to allow all early origins in cis to fire simultaneously. Indeed a block at the onset of the replication was correlated with an abnormal distribution of elongation factors in cells with an altered lamin organization (49Moir R.D. Spann T.P. Herrmann H. Goldman R.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1179-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). We failed to detect strong abnormalities in the general distribution of lamins in nocodazole-treated cells (not shown); however, our analysis is probably insufficient to definitely rule out such a possibility. On the other hand, specialized sub-nuclear compartments with different concentrations of transcription and replication factors are present in the nuclei of untreated cells (50Cardoso M.C. Sporbert A. Leonhardt H. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 32–33: 15-23Crossref Google Scholar, 51Stein G.S. van Wijnen A.J. Stein J.L. Lian J.B. Montecino M. Choi J. Zaidi K. Javed A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2527-2533Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The existence of preferred localization of chromosomal sub-domains and whole chromosomes within the nucleus (52Marshall W.F. Fung J.C. Sedat J.W. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 53Croft J.A. Bridger J.M. Boyle S. Perry P. Teague P. Bickmore W.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1119-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar) may be correlated with the uneven distribution of such factors, and abnormal chromosome positioning might interfere with their proper replication. Indeed, chromosome positioning in interphase seems to require the passage through the S and M phases (14Bridger J.M. Boyle S. Kill I.R. Bickmore W.A. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 149-152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Thus, the position of each chromosome in interphase nuclei may be, at least in part, determined during metaphase and anaphase of the previous cell cycle. 4E. Manders and R. Van Driel, personal communication. In the work presented here, chromosome positioning was not studied, but we observed that chromosome distribution is perturbed upon disruption of the mitotic spindle and mitotic slippage. In support to this hypothesis, experiments in yeast correlated nocodazole treatment to a facilitated chromatin diffusion in interphase, which in turn leads to an expanded confinement region of chromosomes (54Marshall W.F. Straight A. Marko J.F. Swedlow J. Dernburg A. Belmont A. Murray A.W. Agard D.A. Sedat J.W. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 930-939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Finally, we cannot exclude that the nocodazole-mediated mitotic block could also alter the chromosome structure, for example their condensation, and consequently perturb their metabolism.Although our analysis was restricted to the mid- to late S-phase banding patterns of chromosomes 1 and X, our observations indicate that changes in nuclear organization induced by nocodazole treatment do not affect the timing of replication of syntenic sequences within a chromosome. Such results are consistent with the stability of the replication patterns of chromosomal sub-domains observed in cultured human cells undergoing chromosome repositioning (14Bridger J.M. Boyle S. Kill I.R. Bickmore W.A. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 149-152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) and with the similar distribution of early and late replication domains observed in non-fragmented and fragmented nuclei of hamster cells (2Ferreira J. Paolella G. Ramos C. Lamond A.I. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1597-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Our results are also in good agreement with experiments showing that when S-phase onset is delayed in yeast cells, the temporal program of replication of chromosome sub-domains is maintained (55Donaldson A.D. Raghuraman M.K. Friedman K.L. Cross F.R. Brewer B.J. Fangman W.L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 173-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The sequential replication program of chromosome sub-domains may be essentially dictated by the chromatin status. For example, in yeast cells, the late replication program, established in the vicinity of telomeres, depends on the silencing chromatin component Sir3 (56Stevenson J.B. Gottschling D.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 146-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), and studies of the human α- and β-globin loci have revealed a correlation between early replication and an open chromatin conformation (57Smith Z.E. Higgs D.R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 1373-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 58Cimbora D.M. Schubeler D. Reik A. Hamilton J. Francastel C. Epner E.M. Groudine M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5581-5591Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar).In conclusion, our results disclose the existence of two independent levels of control on replication timing of mammalian chromosomes; one ensures the synchrony of the onset of replication on the whole chromosome population of a nuclear compartment, and the second establishes the sequential replication timing of sub-regions along each chromosome. This also indicates that the completion of the replication program along a chromosome is independent of the replication status of the chromosome population as a whole. DNA replication of eukaryotic chromosomes initiates at multiple sites and at various times during S phase, according to an orderly program (1Berezney R. Dubey D.D. Huberman J.A. Chromosoma. 2000; 108: 471-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar).

Interestingly, it has been demonstrated that the programming of one late replication origin occurs during the G1 phase between mitosis and START (12Raghuraman M.K. Brewer B.J. Fangman W.L. Science. 1997; 276: 806-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In good agreement with this latter finding,ex vivo analysis of DNA replication of isolated Chinese hamster nuclei introduced in Xenopus egg extracts suggested that replication timing is determined during early G1 in mammalian cells, at a stage called the “timing decision point,” after completion of the positioning of chromosomal domains within the nucleus (13Dimitrova D.S. Gilbert D.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 983-993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). However, some evidence indicates that early and late replicating chromosomal domains are unaffected in abnormal nuclear structures, such as micronuclei (2Ferreira J. Paolella G. Ramos C. Lamond A.I. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1597-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), or during chromosome repositioning that occurs when quiescent human cells re-enter the cell cycle (14Bridger J.M. Boyle S. Kill I.R. Bickmore W.A. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 149-152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Recent work suggested that a passage through the S and M phases plays a key role in correct repositioning of chromosomes during the next interphase (14Bridger J.M. Boyle S. Kill I.R. Bickmore W.A. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 149-152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Interestingly, treatment with spindle poisons affected the synchrony of replication of individual chromosomes (15Stubblefield E. Symp. Int. Soc. Cell Biol. 1964; 3: 223-248Google Scholar). After prolonged metaphase block, mammalian cells progressively exit mitosis without an intervening cell division, a phenomenon called adaptation or mitotic slippage, giving rise to tetraploid derivatives (16Andreassen P.R. Margolis R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 789-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 17Khan S.H. Wahl G.M. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 396-401PubMed Google Scholar, 18Kung A.L. Sherwood S.W.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2621-2631Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Normal human and rodent cells undergo a second block in G1, which prevents such cells from further cycling (17Khan S.H. Wahl G.M. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 396-401PubMed Google Scholar,20Cross S.M. Sanchez C.A. Morgan C.A. Schimke M.K. Ramel S. Idzerda R.L. Raskind W.H. Reid B.J.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), whereas transformed and immortalized cells generally re-enter S phase. Mitotic slippage is often accompanied by abnormal nuclear budding and micro-nucleation (15Stubblefield E. Symp. Int. Soc. Cell Biol. 1964; 3: 223-248Google Scholar, 24Fournier R.E.K. Ruddle F.H.

Our study was aimed to investigate the consequences of nuclear alteration on the temporal programming of chromosome duplication of mammalian cells upon treatment with the spindle poison nocodazole. We studied the timing of replication in nocodazole-treated and untreated cells of the Chinese hamster line GMA32,"
