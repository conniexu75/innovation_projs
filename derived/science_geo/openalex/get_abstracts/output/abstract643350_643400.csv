https://openalex.org/W2994559322,"Accumulating evidence indicates that patient-derived organoids (PDOs) can predict drug responses in the clinic, but the ability of PDOs to predict responses to chemoradiation in cancer patients remains an open question. Here we generate a living organoid biobank from patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation (NACR) enrolled in a phase III clinical trial. Our co-clinical trial data confirm that rectal cancer organoids (RCOs) closely recapitulate the pathophysiology and genetic changes of corresponding tumors. Chemoradiation responses in patients are highly matched to RCO responses, with 84.43% accuracy, 78.01% sensitivity, and 91.97% specificity. These data imply that PDOs predict LARC patient responses in the clinic and may represent a companion diagnostic tool in rectal cancer treatment."

In glioblastoma, EGFR is preferentially co-amplified with its two endogenous enhancer elements active in the cell type of origin. These regulatory elements, their contacts, and their contribution to cell fitness are preserved on high-level circular extrachromosomal DNA amplifications. Interrogating the locus with a CRISPR interference screening approach reveals a diversity of additional elements that impact cell fitness.

Our studies indicate that oncogene amplifications are shaped by regulatory dependencies in the non-coding genome. The “gene centric” view of DNA amplification focuses on identifying the potential oncogene in the minimal common region of copy number gain, but recent work on genome organization and gene regulation has revealed the crucial importance of neighboring regions in transcriptional control. Topologically associating domains (TADs) and the genes within them have emerged as units of genome organization (Dixon et al., 2012Dixon J.R. Selvaraj S. Yue F. Kim A. Li Y. Shen Y. Hu M. Liu J.S.

We therefore decided to revisit the prevailing paradigm on gene amplification and interrogate the regions beyond the traditional 5′ to 3′ boundaries of the oncogene. Oncogene amplification can be classified into two broad categories: low-level copy gain and high-level amplification. Low-level gains arise because of large chromosome-level abnormalities or smaller tandem duplications at a locus. Low-level copy number gains often remain stable upon their establishment. High-level amplifications arise by entirely different mechanisms, such as breakage-fusion bridges or chromothripsis, leading to oncogenes amplified in homogenously staining regions or carried on circular extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA). Continuous selective pressure can drive a progressive increase in oncogene copy number to levels that can reach 50 or more (Turner et al., 2017Turner K.M. Deshpande V. Beyter D. Koga T. Rusert J.

Regardless of the class, amplifications always take additional sequences beyond the body of the gene, but it remains unclear whether these additional sequences are functional or are just passengers. Aberrant enhancer activity is a key driver of gene expression programs that contribute to tumor formation, maintenance, and progression. Compared to their normal counterparts, tumor cells frequently show locus-specific gains and losses of typical- and super-enhancer activity across the epigenome (Akhtar-Zaidi et al., 2012Akhtar-Zaidi B.

In one instance, duplication of the androgen receptor gene and its enhancer contributes to the progression of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (Takeda et al., 2018Takeda D.Y. Spisak S.

These studies illustrate that a change in a single enhancer can profoundly promote the tumor phenotype. Based on this background, we performed a comprehensive survey of the patterns of co-amplification around oncogenes. We investigated the role of co-amplifications in gene regulation, regulatory element acquisition, chromatin topology, and their impact on cell fitness using a combination of ChIP-seq, 4C-seq, and CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) screening. With EGFR as our exemplar, we found that the oncogenes amplified on circular extrachromosomal DNA select for existing and new regulatory interactions that promote cancer growth. EGFR is the second most significant amplification occurring across tumor types (Zack et al., 2013Zack T.I. Schumacher S.E. Carter S.L. Cherniack A.D. Saksena G. Tabak B. Lawrence M.S. Zhsng C.Z. Wala J. Mermel C.H. et al.Pan-cancer patterns of somatic copy number alteration.Nat. Genet. 2013; 45: 1134-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (1170) Google Scholar). High-level focal amplification of EGFR is especially prevalent in glioblastoma, often arising on circular extrachromosomal DNA (Turner et al., 2017Turner K.M. Deshpande V. Beyter D. Koga T. Rusert J. Lee C. Li B. Arden K. Ren B. Nathanson D.A. et al.Extrachromosomal oncogene amplification drives tumour evolution and genetic heterogeneity.Nature. 2017; 543: 122-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). We first evaluated EGFR amplicons in 174 amplified glioblastoma specimens curated by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Visual inspection of the aligned amplicons revealed that 173 out of 174 amplicons include 130 kb of non-coding DNA upstream of the EGFR gene. We hypothesized that if any genomic features undergo co-selection with the EGFR gene upon amplification, the associated amplicons would be expected to extend distally to include these features, manifesting as a “skewing” of amplicons with respect to the genomic location of the oncogene (Figure 1A). To test for this scenario, we developed a Monte Carlo-based method in which the actual distribution of amplicons at a given locus was compared to that of amplicons randomly shuffled uniformly at the locus such that amplicons still encompassed the oncogene. This revealed a striking skew of amplicons toward the region upstream of EGFR (p < 0.0001). This region harbors non-coding DNA and the gene SEC61G, which is not consistently co-amplified with EGFR (Figure 1B). Given that the core co-amplified region extending 130 kb upstream of the gene is entirely non-coding, we mapped the active regulatory elements using ChIP-seq data for the promoter and enhancer histone mark H3K27ac. We identified two H3K27ac signals directly within the region of skew. Each of these putative enhancers showed near perfect co-amplification with the EGFR gene (Figure 1C). Multiple lines of evidence supported their functional activity: both EGFR enhancers lay within accessible chromatin measured by assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq), were bound by RNA polymerase II, and expressed enhancer RNA (Figure 1D). To assess the functional contribution of the upstream EGFR enhancers on EGFR expression and cell viability, we designed a CRISPRi approach for these two loci using doxycycline-inducible dCas9-KRAB and multiple single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) for each enhancer (Figure 1E). Targeting either EGFR enhancer in an EGFR-unamplified glioblastoma cell line consistently reduced EGFR transcript levels, on par with that obtained by targeting the EGFR promoter (Figure 1F). The reduced EGFR expression resulting from CRISPRi of the 86-kb and 130-kb upstream enhancers inhibited cell viability (Figure 1G), supporting enhancer contributions to tumor biology. In contrast, sgRNAs targeting an unrelated locus (SQLE) did not affect EGFR expression (Figure S1A). Thus, the co-amplified region upstream of EGFR contains two bona fide enhancers that regulate EGFR expression and cellular fitness. Based on the role of enhancers in defining cellular states, we hypothesized that the preferential selection of enhancers during oncogenic amplification depends upon their active and open status in the tissue type from which cancer arises. Enhancers were tested for their activity in the 134 tissues profiled by the Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium (Figure 2A). At the EGFR locus in glioblastoma, the H3K27ac profile within the region of skew most closely resembled nervous system tissues, specifically a hippocampus tissue specimen and embryonic stem-cell-derived neurosphere culture (Figure 2B). The 86-kb and 130-kb upstream EGFR enhancers also showed binding of SOX2, a transcription factor vital to the maintenance of neural progenitors and stem-like glioblastoma cells (Figure 2C) (Ellis et al., 2004Ellis P. Fagan B.M. Magness S.T. Hutton S. Taranova O. Hayashi S. McMahon A. Rao M. Pevny L.

To understand the role of the EGFR enhancers in their amplified context, we identified 9 glioblastoma cell cultures with high-level focal EGFR amplifications (Figures 3A and 3B ). Despite the heterogeneous nature of EGFR amplicons, the two EGFR enhancer elements were consistently amplified across all 9 glioblastomas. H3K27ac levels at the EGFR promoter and the two enhancers positively correlated with the number of copies of EGFR (p < 0.0001) (Figures S2A and S2B), indicating that enhancer acetylation likely occurred on every copy of the amplicon. Furthermore, in some instances, the expression levels of EGFR were higher than predicted based on copy number alone (Figure S2C), suggesting additional transcriptional regulation. In two glioblastomas, the copy number of the upstream EGFR enhancers was higher than that of EGFR itself (red arrows, Figure 3B), implying that the enhancers had been subject to positive selection beyond that of the EGFR gene itself.Figure S2EGFR Locus Histone Acetylation and RNA Levels Scaled by Copy Number, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) H3K27ac ChIP-seq tracks of the EGFR upstream region for two EGFR amplified and two un-amplified glioblastoma models.(B) A scatterplot indicating, for all glioblastoma stem cell models profiled, copy number and normalized H3K27ac peak size for the three peaks at the EGFR locus.

In glioblastoma, the EGFR gene is frequently amplified as extrachromosomal amplicons that arise through chromothripsis (Rausch et al., 2012aRausch T. Jones D.T. Zapatka M. Stütz A.M. Zichner T.

Indeed, using DNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), we confirmed the presence of extrachromosomal EGFR amplification in two samples (Figures 3C and S3). In four of the glioblastoma samples with EGFR amplification, we reconstructed the circular nature of the amplification by using a combination of split and discordant paired-end reads from the H3K27ac ChIP-seq data (see STAR Methods) (Figure 3D) (Sanborn et al., 2013Sanborn J.Z.

Reconstruction of the circular structure of the EGFR amplifications in context with cis-regulatory features revealed other heterogeneous arrangements containing neighboring genes and multiple active regulatory elements, in addition to the two EGFR enhancers (Figures 3E and S3). In one glioblastoma model (GBM3565), 3 non-contiguous genomic segments that normally span two individual TADs were brought together by the formation of the extrachromosomal amplification (Figure 3E). We investigated the three-dimensional topology of the EGFR locus in unamplified glioblastoma models by generating CTCF ChIP-seq profiles and integrating publicly available HiC data (Johnston et al., 2019Johnston M.J. Nikolic A. Ninkovic N. Guilhamon P. Cavalli F.M.G. Seaman S. Zemp F.J. Lee J. Abdelkareem A. Ellestad K. et al.High-resolution structural genomics reveals new therapeutic vulnerabilities in glioblastoma.Genome Res. 2019; 29: 1211-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) (Figure 4A). EGFR resides within a 480-kb loop domain, bounded by two inward-facing CTCF motifs containing both enhancers and the EGFR gene. We performed circular chromosome conformation capture sequencing (4C-seq) on an EGFR-unamplified glioblastoma (GSC23) to interrogate the genomic structure of the EGFR locus. We first anchored on the 5′ EGFR domain boundary and found that the loop domain was preserved in this EGFR unamplified sample (Figure S4A). Anchoring from the EGFR promoter, EGFR had strong contacts with the two upstream enhancers, as well as the multiple enhancers within the gene body (Figure 4B). In the EGFR-amplified sample GBM3565, 4C-seq anchored on the EGFR promoter revealed a striking rearrangement of the locus topology (Figure 4C). In addition to preservation of the contacts between the endogenous enhancers and the EGFR promoter, multiple new contacts occurred within the loop domain between the promoter and other enhancers. One of the contacts was between the EGFR promoter and a gained enhancer specific to the glioblastoma model. Perhaps most strikingly, there were new 3D contacts extending past the canonical domain boundary. 4C-seq anchored on the normal 5′ domain boundary revealed a stark weakening of the strength of the boundary loop (Figure S4B). ChIP-seq studies showed that CTCF binding was preserved at the boundaries of the amplified loop domain, indicating that the new contacts beyond the boundary occurred without a disruption to CTCF occupancy.Figure S4EGFR Locus 4C-seq Data for Unamplified and Amplified Glioblastoma Models, Related to Figure 4Show full caption(A and B) 4C-seq of un-amplified GSC23 (A) and amplified GBM3565 (B).

Given the striking difference in chromosome topology between the amplified and unamplified EGFR locus, we functionally interrogated every regulatory element at the EGFR locus through a 21-day CRISPRi proliferation dropout screen, utilizing 9,559 guides targeting more than 100 regions across the locus in EGFR-amplified (GBM3565) and EGFR-unamplified (GSC23) models (Figure 5A). As expected, sgRNAs targeting the EGFR promoter were the most significantly depleted across the screen, indicating that the EGFR promoter strongly contributes to cellular fitness (Figures 5B–5D). Furthermore, the endogenous EGFR enhancers 1 and 2 scored as fitness enhancers in the amplified sample, indicating that, even in the context of the amplification, they remain functional. In addition to the preserved regulatory links, the screen revealed other instances of regulatory rewiring. For simplicity, we named these enhancers E3, E4, and E5. First, loss of a fitness signal at E3 in the amplified line was due to its deletion within the amplicon. Enhancer E4 was a cell-line-specific enhancer showing both a gain of activity and a new contact, with the second most robust fitness score across the locus on the amplified locus. Enhancer E5 had a high fitness score solely driven by a new 3D contact on the amplicon. Perhaps the most striking finding was that CRISPRi significance scores nearly perfectly mirrored H3K27ac peak strength across the amplified and unamplified loci, indicating that nearly every enhancer element provided some level of functional contribution to overall fitness. Overall, these data indicate that the preservation of contacts to enhancers and even purely topological changes driven by amplification and circularization can modulate an oncogene’s ability to affect cell viability. We interrogated available datasets from multiple cancer types to determine if the co-amplification of enhancers and oncogenes was a more general phenomenon. Using SNP microarray data publicly available from TCGA, TARGET, and several individual cancer profiling efforts (Chen et al., 2008Chen Y. Takita J. Choi Y.L. Kato M. Ohira M. Sanada M. Wang L.

Schumacher S.E. et al.Subgroup-specific structural variation across 1,000 medulloblastoma genomes.Nature. 2012; 488: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar), we quantified copy number alterations across 4,577 human tumor samples representing 9 different solid cancers (Figure 6A). We searched specifically for high-level amplifications, as these are frequently propagated extrachromosomally (Turner et al., 2017Turner K.M. Deshpande V. Beyter D. Koga T. Rusert J. Lee C. Li B. Arden K. Ren B. Nathanson D.A. et al.Extrachromosomal oncogene amplification drives tumour evolution and genetic heterogeneity.Nature. 2017; 543: 122-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Of these tumors, 743 tumors had high-level focal oncogene amplification (copy number > 7) with 43 amplified COSMIC-defined oncogenes (Forbes et al., 2017Forbes S.A. Beare D. Boutselakis H. Bamford S.

Cancer. 2018; 18: 696-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). EGFR amplification in glioblastoma was the most common, followed by ERBB2 amplification in breast cancer. For each of the 43 occurrences of focal amplification, we analyzed reference H3K27ac ChIP-seq data from representative tumors and identified putative enhancers likely to be consistently present on amplicons (Figure 6B), revealing a general pattern of co-amplification of oncogenes and associated enhancers, with 30 of 43 occurrences of focal amplification containing specific distally positioned enhancer elements co-amplified with the oncogene on every amplicon (Figure 6C). To determine if the putative enhancers were co-selected with their oncogenes, we applied our Monte Carlo-based test for amplicon skewing and detected 15 instances of amplicon skewing (p < 0.0001) (Table S1). For 7 of the 15 skewed amplicons, the region of skew contained a neighboring oncogene that had been co-amplified with the presumed driver oncogene. For example, CCND1 was co-amplified with CTTN in several tumor types, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Previous reports of co-amplification of oncogenes (Dedes et al., 2010Dedes K.J.

Seven occurrences of amplification skewed toward regions that were either non-coding or containing genes without known oncogenic function (Figure 6D). We used H3K27ac ChIP-seq data from representative tumors for each oncogene to understand the regulatory landscape within the region of co-amplification. In all 7 cases, the H3K27ac ChIP-seq data revealed overlapping super-enhancers and typical enhancers within the regions of skew. In addition to EGFR, the most striking cases were MYC in group 3 medulloblastoma and MYCN in both neuroblastoma and Wilms tumors. MYC was co-amplified with a super-enhancer in medulloblastoma not only on contiguous amplicons but also in more complex non-contiguous amplicons, which further implied that oncogene and enhancers are co-selected with oncogenes (Figure S6). MYCN showed different skew patterns in neuroblastoma and Wilms tumor (Figures 6E and 6F). If the basis of skewing in amplicon structure is determined by enhancer selection, then the regions of skew should contain active enhancers, unique to each tumor type. Indeed, H3K27ac ChIP-seq data from neuroblastoma revealed a super-enhancer within the 3′ skew (Figure 6E). To independently validate these in silico data, we obtained 5 primary Wilms tumors and performed H3K27ac ChIP-seq, which revealed the presence of a recurrent super-enhancer that directly overlapped with the 5′ region of skew on amplicons (Figure 6F). This super-enhancer was exclusive to Wilms tumors and not observed in neuroblastoma. Reciprocally, the neuroblastoma MYCN super-enhancer was not observed in Wilms tumor. These observations suggest that the MYCN oncogene undergoes preferential selection with cancer-specific enhancers. Co-amplified enhancers were tested for their activity in normal tissues from the Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium. At the MYCN locus in neuroblastoma, the co-amplified super-enhancer was most active in fetal adrenal tissue, which is rich with neural crest derivatives and generally accepted to be a cell type of origin for neuroblastoma (Figure 6G) (Jiang et al., 2011Jiang M. Stanke J. Lahti J.M. The connections between neural crest development and neuroblastoma.Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2011; 94: 77-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In MYCN-driven neuroblastoma, the neural-crest determinants MYCN, TWIST1, and GATA3 occupied the 3′ super-enhancer (Figure 6H). Among the diversity of tissues surveyed by the Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium, the MYCN super-enhancer in Wilms tumor was most specific to the human embryonic kidney (Figure 6I), the tissue of origin for this cancer (Rivera and Haber, 2005Rivera M.N.

https://openalex.org/W2989952557,"Adult mesenchymal stem cells, including preadipocytes, possess a cellular sensory organelle called the primary cilium. Ciliated preadipocytes abundantly populate perivascular compartments in fat and are activated by a high-fat diet. Here, we sought to understand whether preadipocytes use their cilia to sense and respond to external cues to remodel white adipose tissue. Abolishing preadipocyte cilia in mice severely impairs white adipose tissue expansion. We discover that TULP3-dependent ciliary localization of the omega-3 fatty acid receptor FFAR4/GPR120 promotes adipogenesis. FFAR4 agonists and ω-3 fatty acids, but not saturated fatty acids, trigger mitosis and adipogenesis by rapidly activating cAMP production inside cilia. Ciliary cAMP activates EPAC signaling, CTCF-dependent chromatin remodeling, and transcriptional activation of PPARγ and CEBPα to initiate adipogenesis. We propose that dietary ω-3 fatty acids selectively drive expansion of adipocyte numbers to produce new fat cells and store saturated fatty acids, enabling homeostasis of healthy fat tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2990946693,"Studies have shown an overlap of Aβ plaques, tau tangles, and α-synuclein (α-syn) pathologies in the brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) with dementia (PDD) patients, with increased pathological burden correlating with severity of cognitive and motor symptoms. Despite the observed co-pathology and concomitance of motor and cognitive phenotypes, the consequences of the primary amyloidogenic protein on the secondary pathologies remain poorly understood. To better define the relationship between α-syn and Aβ plaques, we injected α-syn preformed fibrils (α-syn mpffs) into mice with abundant Aβ plaques. Aβ deposits dramatically accelerated α-syn pathogenesis and spread throughout the brain. Remarkably, hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) was induced in α-syn mpff-injected 5xFAD mice. Finally, α-syn mpff-injected 5xFAD mice showed neuron loss that correlated with the progressive decline of cognitive and motor performance. Our findings suggest a feed-forward mechanism whereby Aβ plaques enhance endogenous α-syn seeding and spreading over time post-injection with mpffs."
https://openalex.org/W2991249110,"How neural circuits develop in the human brain has remained almost impossible to study at the neuronal level. Here, we investigate human cortical neuron development, plasticity, and function using a mouse/human chimera model in which xenotransplanted human cortical pyramidal neurons integrate as single cells into the mouse cortex. Combined neuronal tracing, electrophysiology, and in vivo structural and functional imaging of the transplanted cells reveal a coordinated developmental roadmap recapitulating key milestones of human cortical neuron development. The human neurons display a prolonged developmental timeline, indicating the neuron-intrinsic retention of juvenile properties as an important component of human brain neoteny. Following maturation, human neurons in the visual cortex display tuned, decorrelated responses to visual stimuli, like mouse neurons, demonstrating their capacity for physiological synaptic integration in host cortical circuits. These findings provide new insights into human neuronal development and open novel avenues for the study of human neuronal function and disease.Video AbstracteyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiI4MjY1MTEyMzljMjcxN2RkYmQyNzhmNTk2Nzg1YzA2OSIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjU5NTExNzE3fQ.UAhhrbUCifeaiUvLhp5pOtY8DNsMFQeL-cSGiO_fksWLU1PhQ0wApDGgvn-gi4dAdb8IfnvClU-2yAcIAFag1NMdUN4vZ3JcvTngv4h58c_GtPzS2VSs3yTRzn0S4wU6jJxM2I4tLMg5KC8XaeUDrz383dI206zAAmHrEmSCMGzlEdkrz6XYSNAey9LBwEBVYh4umz5yAA7iRr8l7bxnJ1zDatezejzEvu_G66L5jZ2ozKyA0p0iD_4yBh0hkZTnNg9UQOxJCmX_2D4kTLRymPpBjAR_NEZ93d_Yo9SWw4lJudwKF1Q9XsIRTwB5n-IUYagcLKFb0ktJcs4ToUatcA(mp4, (13.09 MB) Download video"

However, it remains unclear whether TMC1 and TMC2 are indeed ion channels and whether they can sense mechanical force directly. Here we express TMC1 from the green sea turtle (CmTMC1) and TMC2 from the budgerigar (MuTMC2) in insect cells, purify and reconstitute the proteins, and show that liposome-reconstituted CmTMC1 and MuTMC2 proteins possess ion channel activity. Furthermore, by applying pressure to proteoliposomes, we demonstrate that both CmTMC1 and MuTMC2 proteins can indeed respond to mechanical stimuli. In addition, CmTMC1 mutants corresponding to human hearing loss mutants exhibit reduced or no ion channel activity. Taken together, our results show that the CmTMC1 and MuTMC2 proteins are pore-forming subunits of mechanosensitive ion channels, supporting TMC1 and TMC2 as hair cell transduction channels."
https://openalex.org/W2990370974,"Radiotherapy and chemotherapy disrupt bone vasculature, but the underlying causes and mechanisms enabling vessel regeneration after bone marrow (BM) transplantation remain poorly understood. Here, we show that loss of hematopoietic cells per se, in response to irradiation and other treatments, triggers vessel dilation, permeability, and endothelial cell (EC) proliferation. We further identify a small subpopulation of Apelin-expressing (Apln+) ECs, representing 0.003% of BM cells, that is critical for physiological homeostasis and transplant-induced BM regeneration. Genetic ablation of Apln+ ECs or Apln-CreER-mediated deletion of Kitl and Vegfr2 disrupt hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) maintenance and contributions to regeneration. Consistently, the fraction of Apln+ ECs increases substantially after irradiation and promotes normalization of the bone vasculature in response to VEGF-A, which is provided by transplanted hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Together, these findings reveal critical functional roles for HSPCs in maintaining vascular integrity and for Apln+ ECs in hematopoiesis, suggesting potential targets for improving BM transplantation."
https://openalex.org/W2991550561,"Cells have evolved complex mechanisms to maintain protein homeostasis, such as the UPRER, which are strongly associated with several diseases and the aging process. We performed a whole-genome CRISPR-based knockout (KO) screen to identify genes important for cells to survive ER-based protein misfolding stress. We identified the cell-surface hyaluronidase (HAase), Transmembrane Protein 2 (TMEM2), as a potent modulator of ER stress resistance. The breakdown of the glycosaminoglycan, hyaluronan (HA), by TMEM2 within the extracellular matrix (ECM) altered ER stress resistance independent of canonical UPRER pathways but dependent upon the cell-surface receptor, CD44, a putative HA receptor, and the MAPK cell-signaling components, ERK and p38. Last, and most surprisingly, ectopic expression of human TMEM2 in C. elegans protected animals from ER stress and increased both longevity and pathogen resistance independent of canonical UPRER activation but dependent on the ERK ortholog mpk-1 and the p38 ortholog pmk-1."
https://openalex.org/W2989954637,"Although synergy is a pillar of modern pharmacology, toxicology, and medicine, there is no consensus on its definition despite its nearly one hundred-year history. Moreover, methods for statistical determination of synergy that account for variation of response to treatment are underdeveloped and if exist are reduced to the traditional t-test, but do not comply with the normal distribution assumption. We offer statistical models for estimation of synergy using an established definition of Bliss drugs’ independence. Although Bliss definition is well-known, it remains a theoretical concept and has never been applied for statistical determination of synergy with various forms of treatment outcome. We rigorously and consistently extend the Bliss definition to detect statistically significant synergy under various designs: (1) in vitro, when the outcome of a cell culture experiment with replicates is the proportion of surviving cells for a single dose or multiple doses, (2) dose-response methodology, (3) in vivo studies in organisms, when the outcome is a longitudinal measurement such as tumor volume, and (4) clinical studies, when the outcome of treatment is measured by survival. For each design, we developed a specific statistical model and demonstrated how to test for independence, synergy, and antagonism, and compute the associated p-value."

Together, these findings delineate how the brain endothelium maintains lactate homeostasis and contributes to adult hippocampal neurogenesis and cognitive functions. The cerebral vasculature is composed of highly specialized endothelial cells (ECs) with various substrate-specific transporters, supporting brain function by transporting circulating nutrients and brain metabolic waste products (Zhao et al., 2015Zhao Z. Nelson A.R. Betsholtz C. Zlokovic B.V. Establishment and dysfunction of the blood-brain barrier.Cell. 2015; 163: 1064-1078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). Lactate was previously assumed to be a metabolic end product; however, accumulating evidence indicates that lactate is a critical energy source and signaling molecule for neurons (Magistretti and Allaman, 2018Magistretti P.J. Allaman I. Lactate in the brain: from metabolic end-product to signalling molecule.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2018; 19: 235-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar), suggesting that lactate homeostasis might be critical for brain function. A recent study reveals that circulating lactate, instead of glucose, is a major substrate of the tricarboxylic acid cycle in all tissues except the brain (Hui et al., 2017Hui S. Ghergurovich J.M. Morscher R.J. Jang C. Teng X. Lu W. Esparza L.A. Reya T. Le Zhan Yanxiang Guo J. et al.Glucose feeds the TCA cycle via circulating lactate.Nature. 2017; 551: 115-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar). The complete lactate sharing between tissues except the brain indicates that the brain has a distinctive metabolic microenvironment, implying an important role of brain ECs in the maintenance of brain lactate homeostasis. Many previous studies have shown that brain ECs express monocarboxylic acid transporter 1 (MCT1), which transports lactate, pyruvate, and ketone bodies across cell membranes, indicating that ECs might allow lactate entry into or efflux out of the brain to maintain lactate homeostasis (Pellerin et al., 1998Pellerin L.

Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is a unique form of neural plasticity that results in the generation of newborn neurons in the dentate gyrus (DG) throughout life (Bond et al., 2015Bond A.M. Ming G.L.

Adult neural stem cells (NSCs) in the subgranular zone (SGZ) sequentially undergo self-renewal and differentiation into proliferating intermediate progenitor cells (IPCs) and neuroblasts and finally give rise to mature dentate granule neurons (Bonaguidi et al., 2011Bonaguidi M.A. Wheeler M.A. Shapiro J.S.

The dense vasculature lying close to the NSCs acts as a critical component of the neurogenic niche, secreting a variety of factors that affect NSC self-renewal and differentiation (Cao et al., 2004Cao L. Jiao X. Zuzga D.S. Liu Y. Fong D.M. Young D. During M.J. VEGF links hippocampal activity with neurogenesis, learning and memory.Nat.

However, the role of brain ECs in the regulation of lactate levels as well as their effect on adult hippocampal neurogenesis remain undefined. Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is a dual lipid/protein phosphatase that dephosphorylates the lipid phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate and inhibits Akt activity (Song et al., 2012Song M.S.

AKT/PKB Signaling: Navigating the Network.Cell. 2017; 169: 381-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1824) Google Scholar). It has been shown previously that PTEN in hippocampal NSCs and progenitors is required for maintaining their quiescence and differentiation (Bonaguidi et al., 2011Bonaguidi M.A. Wheeler M.A. Shapiro J.S. Stadel R.P. Sun G.J. Ming G.L. Song H.

Here we used a mouse model in which PTEN was deleted from brain ECs to reveal the roles of brain ECs in regulating lactate homeostasis and adult neurogenesis. PTEN floxed mice (Suzuki et al., 2001Suzuki A. Yamaguchi M.T. Ohteki T. Sasaki T. Kaisho T. Kimura Y. Yoshida R. Wakeham A. Higuchi T.

We confirmed that Cre activity was only detected in brain ECs (Figures S1A–S1G) but not in hippocampal Sox2+, DCX+, GFAP+, or NeuN+ cells of SP-A-Cre;ROSA-EYFP mice (Figures S1H–S1K). Immunofluorescence staining of PTEN in embryonic day 16.5 (E16.5) brain sections demonstrated that PTEN was absent in brain ECs of PTENfl/fl mice (Figure S2A), which was confirmed by real-time PCR and western blotting of isolated brain ECs (Figures S2B and S2C). There was no significant difference in vessel density, vascular branching, or capillary diameter among littermate wild-type (WT), control PTENfl/+, and PTENfl/fl mutant mice when experiments were performed (Figures S2D–S2G). The brain vasculature of PTENfl/fl mice was morphologically normal (Figure S2D), exhibiting tight junction, basement membrane, and apical cell surface markers; smooth muscle cell and pericyte coverage; and glucose transporters comparable with the controls (Figures S2H–S2K). We first determined whether adult hippocampal neurogenesis was affected in PTENfl/fl mice. No difference was observed in the overall morphology of the DG between PTENfl/fl mutants and controls (Figure 1A). Using a bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) pulse labeling method, we assessed the proliferation and differentiation of NSCs in PTENfl/fl and control mice 1, 7, and 28 days after BrdU injection on postnatal day 30 (P30), the key developmental stages of new DG neurons in the adult mouse brain. Quantitative analysis showed that PTENfl/fl mice had a significantly higher number of BrdU+ cells in the SGZ compared with controls 1 day post-injection (dpi) (Figures 1A and 1B). Further analysis indicated that Sox2+GFAP−BrdU+ transiently amplifying progenitor (TAP) cells were significantly increased, whereas Sox2+GFAP+BrdU+ radial glia-like (RGL) cells were decreased at 1 dpi (Figures 1C–1E), suggesting that adult NSC proliferation was elevated in PTENfl/fl mice. To test whether elevated cell proliferation was due to activation of NSCs in PTENfl/fl mice, we used cytrarabine (Ara-C) to ablate proliferative cells to stimulate NSC activation (Ahn and Joyner, 2005Ahn S. Joyner A.L. In vivo analysis of quiescent adult neural stem cells responding to Sonic hedgehog.Nature. 2005; 437: 894-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar; Figure S3A). Ara-C infusion into 5-week-old mice successfully decreased the number of proliferative stem cells in both PTENfl/fl and control mice at 7 dpi (Figures S3B and S3C). At 13 dpi, PTENfl/fl mice showed significantly increased BrdU+ cells compared with controls (Figure S3D). Using MCM2 to distinguish dividing cells from cells out of the cell cycle, a significant increase in Sox2+GFAP+MCM2+ and Sox2+GFAP−MCM2+ TAPs was observed (Figures S3E and S3F), demonstrating that adult NSC activation was indeed promoted in PTENfl/fl mice. We next assessed the differentiation of NSCs. Although an increased percentage of DCX+BrdU+ newborn neurons was observed in PTENfl/fl mice at 7 dpi (Figures 1F and 1G), the number of DCX+ immature neurons of the whole DG was decreased (Figure 1H). The number of mature neurons represented by NeuN+BrdU+ cells was significantly reduced in PTENfl/fl mice at 28 dpi (Figures 1I and 1J). Moreover, at 28 dpi, compared with elaborated dendrites in controls, RFP-labeled neurons in PTEN mutant mice showed reduced total dendritic length and dendritic complexity, indicating significant impairment of dendritic arborization of newborn neurons in the hippocampus (Figures 1K–1M). All of these data demonstrate that disruption of endothelial PTEN impairs adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Previous studies have revealed that defective adult hippocampal neurogenesis impairs learning and memory (Saxe et al., 2006Saxe M.D. Battaglia F. Wang J.W. Malleret G. David D.J. Monckton J.E. Garcia A.D. Sofroniew M.V. Kandel E.R. Santarelli L. et al.Ablation of hippocampal neurogenesis impairs contextual fear conditioning and synaptic plasticity in the dentate gyrus.Proc. Natl. Acad.

We therefore performed a battery of behavior tests to evaluate whether cognitive functions were altered in PTENfl/fl mice. Compared with controls, PTENfl/fl mice displayed less preference for the location of a novel object during the novel object location (NOL) test, indicating a deficit in spatial memory (Figures S3G and 1N). Similarly, in the novel object recognition (NOR) test, PTENfl/fl mice showed reduced exploratory preference for novel objects (Figures S3H and 1O). Additionally, PTENfl/fl mice showed significantly impaired learning, as shown by reduced freezing behavior to contextual stimuli but not to tone stimuli in fear conditioning (FC) tests (Figures S3I and 1P). There was no significant difference between PTENfl/fl and control mice in performance in the open field test (OFT), forced swimming test (FST), elevated plus maze (EPM) test, and tail suspension test (TST), suggesting that the deficits in learning and memory of PTENfl/fl mice resulted from cognitive impairment rather than locomotor activity, anxiety, or depression (Figures S3J–S3M). To test whether postnatal endothelial PTEN is also required for hippocampal neurogenesis, we bred PTENfl/fl mice with Cdh5-CreERT2 transgenic mice that expressed a tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase in ECs (Wang et al., 2010Wang Y. Nakayama M. Pitulescu M.E. Schmidt T.S. Bochenek M.L. Sakakibara A. Adams S. Davy A. Deutsch U. Lüthi U. et al.Ephrin-B2 controls VEGF-induced angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis.Nature. 2010; 465: 483-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar) and assessed adult neurogenesis in Cdh5-CreERT2;PTENfl/fl mutant mice (hereafter referred to as iPTENfl/fl) and control Cdh5-CreERT2;PTENfl/+ mice (hereafter referred to as iPTENfl/+). Tamoxifen was administrated at P30 once every 2 days 4 times, followed by analysis of the activation of NSCs in 2- and 7-month-old iPTENfl/fl and control mice at 1 dpi after BrdU injection (Figure 2A). Cdh5-CreERT2 expression was detected in brain ECs 2 months after tamoxifen treatment (Figure S2L). The morphology of the brain vasculature of 2-month-old iPTENfl/fl mice was comparable with that of controls (Figure S2M). 2-month-old iPTENfl/fl mice had a significantly higher number of BrdU+ cells in the SGZ compared with controls (Figures 2B–2D), confirming overactivation of hippocampal NSCs upon PTEN loss in ECs. BrdU+ cells (Figures 2C and 2D) and Nestin+ RGLs (Figures 2E and 2F) were significantly decreased in the DG of 7-month-old iPTENfl/fl mice, indicating that NSCs were exhausted. Consistently, MCM2+Nestin+ proliferating progenitors were increased, whereas DCX+ immature neurons were decreased in 7-month-old iPTENfl/fl mice (Figures 2G–2I). In summary, postnatal deletion of PTEN in brain ECs leads to accelerated activation of adult NSCs and, eventually, a diminished NSC pool. iPTENfl/fl mice also displayed impaired cognitive functions, showing less preference in the NOL and NOR tests as well as reduced freezing behavior to contextual stimuli at 2 months (Figures 2J–2L). Impairment of learning and memory was even worse in 7-month-old iPTENfl/fl mice (Figures 2J–2L). To meet the metabolic needs of the brain, brain ECs transport nutrients and energy substrates from the blood into the brain and metabolic products from the brain into the blood (Zhao et al., 2015Zhao Z. Nelson A.R. Betsholtz C. Zlokovic B.V. Establishment and dysfunction of the blood-brain barrier.Cell. 2015; 163: 1064-1078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the levels of a diverse range of metabolically important molecules, including glucose, lactate, and amino acids, in the hippocampus of PTENfl/fl mutant and control mice. Compared with control mice, lactate levels were significantly elevated in the hippocampus of PTENfl/fl mice, whereas glucose levels were comparable, and the levels of amino acids were slightly increased (Figures S4A–S4D). To confirm lactate enrichment in the hippocampus of PTENfl/fl mutant mice, microdialysates derived from the hippocampus were collected and measured with an online electrochemical system (OECS) (Lin et al., 2014Lin Y. Yu P. Hao J. Wang Y. Ohsaka T. Mao L. Continuous and simultaneous electrochemical measurements of glucose, lactate, and ascorbate in rat brain following brain ischemia.Anal. Chem. 2014; 86: 3895-3901Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Simultaneous in vivo monitoring detected accumulation of lactate, but not glucose, in PTEN mutant hippocampi (Figures 3A and 3B ). Thus, in the absence of endothelial PTEN, the mouse brain, including the hippocampus, accumulates lactate. To evaluate the effect of increased levels of lactate on adult hippocampal neurogenesis, we bilaterally injected saline or 10 mM lactate into the hippocampi of 8-week-old mice. Compared with the control side treated with saline, lactate injection significantly increased the numbers of BrdU+ cells (Figures 3C–3E) and Sox2+GFAP−BrdU+ cells (Figures 3F and 3G) and decreased the numbers of Sox2+GFAP+BrdU+ cells (Figures 3F and 3G) and NeuN+BrdU+ cells (Figures 3H and 3I) in the SGZ, phenocopying the PTEN mutants. Lactate injection also reduced total dendritic length as well as dendritic complexity (Figures 3J–3L). The in vitro experiment confirmed that lactate treatment significantly impaired the differentiation of NSCs and reduced the dendritic complexity of cultured primary neurons (Figures S4E–S4J). All of these results indicate that hippocampal accumulation of lactate impairs adult neurogenesis. The accumulation of lactate in cerebrovascular PTENfl/fl knockout mice suggested an important role of brain ECs in the regulation of brain lactate levels. We therefore investigated changed brain endothelial transporters and their involvement in the regulation of hippocampal lactate homeostasis. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of mouse brain ECs revealed significantly dysregulated solute carrier transporters (Figure 4A), which were confirmed by real-time PCR (Figure 4B). Among them, we noticed that MCT1 was expressed in brain ECs at a high level and was significantly downregulated in PTENfl/fl mutant mice (Figures 4A and 4B). Analyses of the Adult Mouse Brain Cell Atlas, which includes RNA profiling of 690,000 individual brain cells (Saunders et al., 2018Saunders A. Macosko E.Z. Wysoker A. Goldman M. Krienen F.M. de Rivera H. Bien E. Baum M. Bortolin L. Wang S. et al.Molecular diversity and specializations among the cells of the adult mouse brain.Cell. 2018; 174: 1015-1030.e16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar), showed that MCT1 was expressed at high levels in ECs in various brain regions (Figure S6A). Western blotting confirmed that the expression of MCT1 was markedly decreased in isolated PTENfl/fl mutant brain ECs, whereas the expression of tight junction Claudin5 and ZO-1 was comparable (Figure 4C). Immunofluorescence staining confirmed that MCT1 was mainly expressed in ECs and greatly reduced in PTENfl/fl and iPTENfl/fl mice by 60% (Figures 4D–4F). Insulin growth factor 1 (IGF-1) significantly upregulated phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt) and decreased MCT1 expression in bEnd.3 brain ECs, whereas the Akt inhibitor MK-2206 dramatically downregulated p-Akt and increased MCT1 expression, confirming that MCT1 expression was negatively regulated by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway (Figure 4G). These data indicate that PTEN/Akt signaling upregulates MCT1 in brain ECs. To test whether endothelial MCT1 mediates lactate flux to maintain brain lactate homeostasis, we injected 1 μL (2.2 × 105 dpm) 14C-lactate into the brains of PTENfl/fl and control mice. Reduced 14C-labeled lactate efflux (∼63% relative to control) was detected in PTENfl/fl mice (Figure 4H). Consistently, knockdown of PTEN significantly impaired bidirectional lactate flux in a brain microvascular EC monolayer Transwell system (Vatine et al., 2017Vatine G.D. Al-Ahmad A. Barriga B.K. Svendsen S. Salim A. Garcia L. Garcia V.J. Ho R. Yucer N. Qian T. et al.Modeling psychomotor retardation using iPSCs from MCT8-deficient patients indicates a prominent role for the blood-brain barrier.Cell Stem Cell. 2017; 20: 831-843.e5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), and overexpression of MCT1 restored lactate transportation (Figures 4I and 4J). All of these data indicate that brain endothelial MCT1 regulated by PTEN/Akt signaling is required for lactate transport across the brain endothelium. Previous studies have reported that the brain vasculature affects the self-renewal, cell migration, and neuronal differentiation of NSCs by EC-derived soluble factors (Cao et al., 2004Cao L. Jiao X. Zuzga D.S. Liu Y. Fong D.M. Young D. During M.J. VEGF links hippocampal activity with neurogenesis, learning and memory.Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 827-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar, Shen et al., 2004Shen Q. Goderie S.K. Jin L. Karanth N. Sun Y. Abramova N. Vincent P. Pumiglia K. Temple S. Endothelial cells stimulate self-renewal and expand neurogenesis of neural stem cells.Science. 2004; 304: 1338-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar). Direct cell contact with ECs has also been shown to maintain NSC quiescence (Ottone et al., 2014Ottone C. Krusche B. Whitby A. Clements M. Quadrato G. Pitulescu M.E. Adams R.H. Parrinello S. Direct cell-cell contact with the vascular niche maintains quiescent neural stem cells.Nat. Cell Biol. 2014; 16: 1045-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). To elucidate whether PTEN-deficient ECs affect NSC activation and differentiation by secreted signals, NSCs were co-cultured with WT or PTEN knockout (PTEN−/−) bEnd.3 cells generated by CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing (Figures S5A and S5B). When co-cultured in the upper panel of a Transwell, both WT and PTEN−/− bEnd.3 ECs enhanced NSCs proliferation to a comparable extent (Figure S5C) and barely affected the differentiation of NSCs (Figures S5D and S5E). When co-cultured in direct contact with WT or PTEN−/− ECs, the proportions of NSCs withdrawn from the cell cycle were comparable (Figure S5F). These data excluded the possibility that PTEN-deficient ECs affect the proliferation of NSCs by secreting soluble factors, indicating that defective endogenous endothelial transporters are mainly responsible for abnormal adult neurogenesis and neuronal dysfunction in PTEN mutant mice. To evaluate the role of endothelial MCT1 in maintaining brain lactate levels and adult hippocampal neurogenesis in vivo, we developed an MCT1 conditional mutant mouse (MCT1fl/fl) by CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome editing (Figure S6B). Single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) were designed to target sites on each side adjoining exon 2 of the MCT1 gene, and the plasmid donor contained two 34-bp loxP sites in 1.4-kb homologous arms flanking exon 2 of the MCT1 gene (Figure S6B). Cas9 protein, sgRNAs, and the plasmid donor were co-injected into mouse zygotes. Correct integration of loxP sites was confirmed by Southern blot and PCR analyses (Figures S6C and S6D). MCT1fl/fl mice were bred with the SP-A-Cre mice to generate the cerebrovascular endothelium-specific MCT1 knockout (SP-A-Cre;MCT1fl/fl; hereafter referred to as MCT1fl/fl) and control mice (SP-A-Cre;MCT1fl/+; hereafter referred to as MCT1fl/+). WT, MCT1fl/fl, and SP-A-Cre;MCT1fl/+ mice showed no differences in vessel density, capillary diameter, and number of BrdU+ NSCs in the DG (data not shown). Immunofluorescent staining confirmed that MCT1 was absent in brain ECs of MCT1fl/fl mice (Figure S6E). MCT1fl/fl mice showed capillary density (Figure S6E), vascular branching, tight junctions, basement membranes, pericyte coverage (data not shown), and blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability (Figures S6F and S6G) comparable with control mice. We then examined adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus of 5-week-old MCT1fl/fl mice. MCT1fl/fl mice showed dramatically increased proliferation in the hippocampus (Figure 5A). More specifically, the densities of Nestin+BrdU+-activated NSCs (Figure 5B), Tbr2+BrdU+ progenitor cells (Figure 5C), as well as DCX+BrdU+ immature neurons (Figure 5D) were increased in the SGZ of MCT1fl/fl mice compared with controls. However, the total number of NeuN+BrdU+ matured newborn neurons was reduced significantly (Figure 5E). Furthermore, MCT1fl/fl mice showed reduced total dendritic length and dendritic complexity (Figures 5F–5H). Importantly, hippocampal lactate levels were increased significantly in MCT1fl/fl mice (Figure 5I). When 14C-labeled lactate (2.2 × 106 d.p.m) was administered into the tail vein, the 14C-labeled lactate in the brain of MCT1fl/fl mice was comparable with control mice 1 h after injection, indicating that lactate influx was not affected by MCT1 deficiency (Figure 5J). When 14C-labeled lactate wa"

Dissection of the subunit- and domain-specific contributions to complex activities is needed to advance mechanistic understanding. Here, we examine the molecular, structural, and genome-wide regulatory consequences of recurrent, single-residue mutations in the putative coiled-coil C-terminal domain (CTD) of the SMARCB1 (BAF47) subunit, which cause the intellectual disability disorder Coffin-Siris syndrome (CSS), and are recurrently found in cancers. We find that the SMARCB1 CTD contains a basic α helix that binds directly to the nucleosome acidic patch and that all CSS-associated mutations disrupt this binding. Furthermore, these mutations abrogate mSWI/SNF-mediated nucleosome remodeling activity and enhancer DNA accessibility without changes in genome-wide complex localization. Finally, heterozygous CSS-associated SMARCB1 mutations result in dominant gene regulatory and morphologic changes during iPSC-neuronal differentiation. These studies unmask an evolutionarily conserved structural role for the SMARCB1 CTD that is perturbed in human disease."

However, the expected outcomes of embryo screening are unclear, which undermines discussion of associated ethical concerns. Here, we use theory, simulations, and real data to evaluate the potential gain of embryo screening, defined as the difference in trait value between the top-scoring embryo and the average embryo. The gain increases very slowly with the number of embryos but more rapidly with the variance explained by the score. Given current technology, the average gain due to screening would be ≈2.5 cm for height and ≈2.5 IQ points for cognitive ability. These mean values are accompanied by wide prediction intervals, and indeed, in large nuclear families, the majority of children top-scoring for height are not the tallest."
https://openalex.org/W2991162729,"Ribosome assembly is an efficient but complex and heterogeneous process during which ribosomal proteins assemble on the nascent rRNA during transcription. Understanding how the interplay between nascent RNA folding and protein binding determines the fate of transcripts remains a major challenge. Here, using single-molecule fluorescence microscopy, we follow assembly of the entire 3′ domain of the bacterial small ribosomal subunit in real time. We find that co-transcriptional rRNA folding is complicated by the formation of long-range RNA interactions and that r-proteins self-chaperone the rRNA folding process prior to stable incorporation into a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex. Assembly is initiated by transient rather than stable protein binding, and the protein-RNA binding dynamics gradually decrease during assembly. This work questions the paradigm of strictly sequential and cooperative ribosome assembly and suggests that transient binding of RNA binding proteins to cellular RNAs could provide a general mechanism to shape nascent RNA folding during RNP assembly."
https://openalex.org/W2991495225,"The synthesis of new ribosomes begins during transcription of the rRNA and is widely assumed to follow an orderly 5′ to 3′ gradient. To visualize co-transcriptional assembly of ribosomal protein-RNA complexes in real time, we developed a single-molecule platform that simultaneously monitors transcription and protein association with the elongating transcript. Unexpectedly, the early assembly protein uS4 binds newly made pre-16S rRNA only transiently, likely due to non-native folding of the rRNA during transcription. Stable uS4 binding became more probable only in the presence of additional ribosomal proteins that bind upstream and downstream of protein uS4 by allowing productive assembly intermediates to form earlier. We propose that dynamic sampling of elongating RNA by multiple proteins overcomes heterogeneous RNA folding, preventing assembly bottlenecks and initiating assembly within the transcription time window. This may be a common feature of transcription-coupled RNP assembly."

Using antibody-binding assays, measurements of virus infectivity, and analyses of lipid membrane order, we found that depletion of cholesterol from HIV-1 particles decreases the conformational stability of Env.

Surface-acting agents, which are incorporated into the virus lipid membrane, caused similar effects as disruption of the Env-cholesterol interaction. Furthermore, substitutions in gp120 that increased structural stability of Env (i.e. induced a “closed” conformation of the trimer) increased virus resistance to cholesterol depletion and to the surface-acting agents. Collectively, these results indicate a critical contribution of the viral membrane to the stability of the Env trimer and to neutralization resistance against antibodies.

Within primary visual cortex, various populations of pyramidal neurons (PNs) send axonal projections to distinct targets, suggesting multiple cellular networks may be independently engaged during behavior. We investigated whether PN subpopulations differentially support visual detection by training mice on a novel eyeblink conditioning task. Applying 2-photon calcium imaging and optogenetic manipulation of anatomically defined PNs, we show that layer 5 corticopontine neurons strongly encode sensory and motor task information and are selectively necessary for performance. Our findings support a model in which target-specific cortical subnetworks form the basis for adaptive behavior by directing relevant information to distinct brain areas. Overall, this work highlights the potential for neurons to form physically interspersed but functionally segregated networks capable of parallel, independent control of perception and behavior."

We describe a method for full-featured 2-photon imaging in awake mice during free locomotion with volitional head rotation. We examine head direction and position encoding in simultaneously imaged apical tuft dendrites and their respective cell bodies in retrosplenial cortex, an area that encodes multi-modal navigational information.

Analysis of over 100,000 synaptic input neurons demonstrated that cocaine-activated neurons comprise selectively connected but broadly distributed corticostriatal networks. Electrophysiological assays using optogenetics to stimulate activated versus nonactivated inputs revealed stronger synapses between coactivated cortical pyramidal neurons and neurons in the dorsal striatum (DS). Repeated cocaine exposure further enhanced the connectivity specifically between drug-activated neurons in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and coactive DS neurons.

Using experimental and theoretical analysis of AWCON, a well-described olfactory neuron in C. elegans, here we derive a general and broadly useful model that matches stimulus history to odor sensation and behavioral responses. We show that AWCON sensory activity is regulated by an absolute signal threshold that continuously adapts to odor history, allowing animals to compare present and past odor concentrations. The model predicts sensory activity and probabilistic behavior during animal navigation in different odor gradients and across a broad stimulus regime. Genetic studies demonstrate that the cGMP-dependent protein kinase EGL-4 determines the timescale of threshold adaptation, defining a molecular basis for a critical model feature. The adaptive threshold model efficiently filters stimulus noise, allowing reliable sensation in fluctuating environments, and represents a feedforward sensory mechanism with implications for other sensory systems."

Recent studies using national registry data indicate increased use of anticoagulation resulting from changes in guidelines and the availability of newer drugs. The aim of this study is to develop and validate an open source risk scoring pipeline for free-text electronic health record data using natural language processing. AF patients discharged from 1st January 2011 to 1st October 2017 were identified from discharge summaries (N = 10,030, 64.6% male, average age 75.3 ± 12.3 years). A natural language processing pipeline was developed to identify risk factors in clinical text and calculate risk for ischaemic stroke (CHA2DS2-VASc) and bleeding (HAS-BLED). Scores were validated vs two independent experts for 40 patients. Automatic risk scores were in strong agreement with the two independent experts for CHA2DS2-VASc (average kappa 0.78 vs experts, compared to 0.85 between experts). Agreement was lower for HAS-BLED (average kappa 0.54 vs experts, compared to 0.74 between experts). In high-risk patients (CHA2DS2-VASc ≥2) OAC use has increased significantly over the last 7 years, driven by the availability of DOACs and the transitioning of patients from AP medication alone to OAC. Factors independently associated with OAC use included components of the CHA2DS2-VASc and HAS-BLED scores as well as discharging specialty and frailty. OAC use was highest in patients discharged under cardiology (69%). Electronic health record text can be used for automatic calculation of clinical risk scores at scale.

Our goal was to investigate the contribution of IGF receptors to IGF-II-mediated fibrosis in these diseases and identify other potential mechanisms key to the fibrotic process. Cognate receptor gene and protein expression were analyzed with qRT-PCR and immunoblot in primary fibroblasts derived from lung tissues of normal donors (NL) and patients with IPF or SSc. Compared to NL, steady-state receptor gene expression was decreased in SSc but not in IPF. IGF-II stimulation differentially decreased receptor mRNA and protein levels in NL, IPF, and SSc fibroblasts. Neutralizing antibody, siRNA, and receptor inhibition targeting endogenous IGF-II and its primary receptors, type 1 IGF receptor (IGF1R), IGF2R, and insulin receptor (IR) resulted in loss of the IGF-II response. IGF-II tipped the TIMP:MMP balance, promoting a fibrotic environment both intracellularly and extracellularly. Differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts by IGF-II was blocked with a TGFβ1 receptor inhibitor. IGF-II also increased TGFβ2 and TGFβ3 expression, with subsequent activation of canonical SMAD2/3 signaling. Therefore, IGF-II promoted fibrosis through IGF1R, IR, and IGF1R/IR, differentiated fibroblasts into myofibroblasts, decreased protease production and extracellular matrix degradation, and stimulated expression of two TGFβ isoforms, suggesting that IGF-II exerts pro-fibrotic effects via multiple mechanisms."

We implemented a multi-modality HIV testing approach to identify 90% or greater of HIV-positive persons in the Botswana Combination Prevention Project (BCPP) intervention communities. Methods BCPP is a cluster-randomized trial designed to evaluate the impact of combination prevention interventions on HIV incidence in 30 communities in Botswana. Community case finding and HIV testing that included home and targeted mobile testing were implemented in the 15 intervention communities. We described processes for identifying HIV-positive persons, uptake of HIV testing by age, gender and venue, characteristics of persons newly diagnosed through BCPP, and coverage of knowledge of status reached at the end of study. Results Of the 61,655 eligible adults assessed in home or mobile settings, 13,328 HIV-positive individuals, or 93% of the estimated 14,270 positive people in the communities were identified through BCPP. Knowledge of status increased by 25% over the course of the study with the greatest increases seen among men (37%) as compared to women (19%) and among youth aged 16–24 (77%) as compared to older age groups (21%). Although more men were tested through mobile than through home-based testing, higher rates of newly diagnosed HIV-positive men were found through home than mobile testing. Conclusions Even when HIV testing coverage is high, additional gains can be made using a multi-modality HIV testing strategy to reach different sub-populations who are being missed by non-targeted program activities. Men and youth can be reached and will engage in community testing when services are brought to places they access routinely."
https://openalex.org/W2989941285,"Influenza A virus (IAV) effectively manipulates host machinery to replicate. There is a growing evidence that an optimal acetylation environment in the host cell is favorable to IAV proliferation and vice versa. The histone deacetylases (HDACs), a family of 18 host enzymes classified into four classes, are central to negatively regulating the acetylation level, hence the HDACs would not be favorable to IAV. Indeed, by using the RNAi and overexpression strategies, we found that human HDAC4, a class II member, possesses anti-IAV properties and is a component of host innate antiviral response. We discovered that IAV multiplication was augmented in HDAC4-depleted cells and abated in HDAC4-supplemented cells. Likewise, the expression of IFITM3, ISG15, and viperin, some of the critical markers of host anti-IAV response was abated in HDAC4-depleted cells and augmented in HDAC4-supplemented cells. In turn, IAV strongly antagonizes the HDAC4, by down-regulating its expression both at the mRNA level via viral RNA endonuclease PA-X and at the polypeptide level by inducing its cleavage via host caspase 3 in infected cells. Such HDAC4 polypeptide cleavage resulted in a ∼30 kDa fragment that is also observed in some heterologous systems and may have a significant role in IAV replication."

For further research, crabs were exposed to sublethal concentrations of 0.03, 0.06, 0.12, 0.24 and 0.48 mg/L. Levels of antioxidants, including superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) were significantly (P<0.05) decreased with dose- and time- dependent responses, meanwhile the oxidative products including malondialdehyde (MDA), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and protein carbonyl in serum increased significantly (P<0.05) at concentrations of 0.24 and 0.48 mg/L throughout the experiment. A significant (P<0.05) increase of intracellular ROS and decrease of phagocytic activity was observed in high concentration groups, with dose- and time- dependent manners during the exposure. In addition, serious genetic damage was detected, for the significant increase (P<0.05) of both comet ratio and %DNA in tail at each concentration, and micronucleus (MN) frequency at concentrations of 0.12, 0.24 and 0.48 mg/L at 96 h.

Data for influenza-like illness (ILI) in the U.S. were collected from the Fluview database. We identified the time lag between two time-series which were weekly surveillances for ILI, total influenza (Total INF), influenza A (INF A), and influenza B (INF B) viruses between two countries using cross-correlation analysis. In order to forecast ILI, Total INF, INF A, and INF B of next season (after 26 weeks) in the U.S., we developed prediction models using linear regression, auto regressive integrated moving average, and an artificial neural network (ANN). As a result of cross-correlation analysis between the countries located in northern and southern hemisphere, the seasonal influenza patterns in Australia and Chile showed a high correlation with those of the U.S. 22 weeks and 28 weeks earlier, respectively. The R2 score of ANN models for ILI for validation set in 2015-2019 was 0.758 despite how hard it is to forecast 26 weeks ahead. Our prediction models forecast that the ILI for the U.S. in 2018-2019 may be later and less severe than those in 2017-2018, judging from the influenza activity for Australia and Chile in 2018. It allows to estimate peak timing, peak intensity, and type-specific influenza activities for next season at 40th week. The correlation between seasonal influenza patterns in the U.S., Australia, and Chile could be used to forecast the next seasonal influenza pattern, which can help to determine influenza vaccine strategy approximately six months ahead in the U.S."

However, neutron production is complicated by the large thermal load expected on the target. The relationship between neutron production and thermal load was examined under various conditions. A target structure for neutron production consists of a Li target and a target basement. Four proton beam profiles were examined to vary the local thermal load on the target structure while maintaining a constant total thermal load. The efficiency of neutron production was evaluated with respect to the total number of protons delivered to the target structure. The target structure was also evaluated by observing its surface after certain numbers of protons were delivered. The yield of the sputtering effect was calculated via a Monte Carlo simulation to investigate whether it caused complications in neutron production. The efficiency of neutron production and the amount of damage done depended on the proton profile. A more focused proton profile resulted in greater damage. The efficiency decreased as the total number of protons delivered to the target structure increased, and the rate of decrease depended on the proton profile. The sputtering effect was not sufficiently large to be a main factor in the reduction in neutron production. The proton beam profile on the target structure was found to be important to the stable operation of the system with a solid-state Li target. The main factor in the rate of reduction in neutron production was found to be the local thermal load induced by proton irradiation of the target."

In one strain, a memory of exposure to 21% O2 suppresses CO2-evoked locomotory arousal; in the other, CO2 evokes arousal regardless of previous O2 experience. We map that variation to a polymorphic dendritic scaffold protein, ARCP-1, expressed in sensory neurons. ARCP-1 binds the Ca2+-dependent phosphodiesterase PDE-1 and co-localizes PDE-1 with molecular sensors for CO2 at dendritic ends. Reducing ARCP-1 or PDE-1 activity promotes CO2 escape by altering neuropeptide expression in the BAG CO2 sensors. Variation in ARCP-1 alters behavioral plasticity in multiple paradigms. Our findings are reminiscent of genetic accommodation, an evolutionary process by which phenotypic flexibility in response to environmental variation is reset by genetic change."

This study was to identify cancer-related genetic alterations by next generation sequencing (NGS) in resected LUAD samples from Korean patients and to determine their associations with clinical features. A total of 201 tumors and their matched peripheral blood samples were analyzed using targeted sequencing via the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform of 242 genes with a median depth of coverage greater than 500X. One hundred ninety-two tumors were amenable to data analysis. EGFR was the most frequently mutated gene, occurring in 106 (55%) patients, followed by TP53 (n = 67, 35%) and KRAS (n = 11, 6%). EGFR mutations were strongly increased in patients that were female and never-smokers. Smokers had a significantly higher tumor mutational burden (TMB) than never-smokers (average 4.84 non-synonymous mutations/megabase [mt/Mb] vs. 2.84 mt/Mb, p = 0.019). Somatic mutations of APC, CTNNB1, and AMER1 in the WNT signaling pathway were highly associated with shortened disease-free survival (DFS) compared to others (median DFS of 89 vs. 27 months, p = 0.018). Patients with low TMB, annotated as less than 2 mt/Mb, had longer DFS than those with high TMB (p = 0.041). A higher frequency of EGFR mutations and a lower of KRAS mutations were observed in Korean LUAD patients. Profiles of 242 genes mapped in this study were compared with whole exome sequencing genetic profiles generated in The Cancer Genome Atlas Lung Adenocarcinoma. NGS-based diagnostics can provide clinically relevant information such as mutations or TMB from readily available formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2991512785,"The balance between bone resorption and formation may be assessed by measurement of bone turnover markers (BTMs), like carboxyl-terminal cross-linked telopeptide of type 1 collagen (CTX-1) and procollagen type 1 amino-terminal propeptide (P1NP). Smoking has been shown to influence bone turnover and to reduce bone mass density (BMD), the exact mechanism for this is, however, not settled. In this post-hoc study including 406 subjects (mean age 51.9 years), we aimed to study the impact of smoking on bone turnover. Moreover, we wanted to assess the inter-correlation between substances regulating bone metabolism and BTMs, as well as tracking over time. BMD measurements and serum analyses of CTX-1, P1NP, osteoprotegerin (OPG), receptor activator of nuclear factor ĸB ligand (RANKL), Dickkopf-1 (DKK1), sclerostin, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and leptin were performed. Repeated serum measurements were made in 195 subjects after four months. Adjustments were made for sex, age, body mass index (BMI), smoking status, insulin resistance, serum calcium, parathyroid hormone, 25-hydroxyvitamin D and creatinine. Smokers had higher levels of DKK1 and OPG, and lower levels of RANKL, as reflected in lower BTMs and BMD compared to non-smokers. There were strong and predominantly positive inter-correlations between BTMs and the other substances, and there was a high degree of tracking with Spearman’s rho from 0.72 to 0.92 (P < 0.001) between measurements four months apart. In conclusion, smokers exhibited higher levels of DKK1 and OPG and a lower bone turnover than did non-smokers. The strong inter-correlations between the serum parameters illustrate the coupling between bone resorption and formation and crosstalk between cells."
https://openalex.org/W2991288655,"The aims of the study were to investigate 1) the effect of 8 weeks of PSP training on anthropometrics, salivary hormones and fitness parameters in youth soccer players, 2) the correlations between fitness and hormonal parameters, and 3) the impact of the experience of the coach and his methodology of training on these parameters. Weight, height, BMI, pubertal development (PDS), salivary Cortisol (sC), salivary Testosterone (sT), salivary sDHEAS, intermittent tests (VO2max), and countermovement jump test (CMJ) modifications of 35 youth soccer players (age: 14±0 yrs; BMI: 20.8±1.8 k/m2) from two Italian clubs (“Lupa Frascati” -LF-; “Albalonga” -AL) were analysed. A significant (p<0.05) time by club effect was observed in sC (F(1,31) = 9.7, ES = 1.13), sT (F(1,31) = 4.2, ES = 0.74), CMJ (F(1,28) = 26.5, ES = 1.94), and VO2max (F(1,28) = 8.5, ES = 1.10). Statistical differences (p<0.05) in weight (F(1,32) = 25.5, ES = 0.11), sC (F(1,31) = 32.1, ES = 1.43), sT/sC ratio (F(1,31) = 10.1, ES = 0.97), sDHEAS/sC ratio (F(1,31) = 6.3, ES = 0.70), and VO2max (F(1,28) = 64.3, ES = 1.74) were found within time factor. Between clubs, differences (p<0.05) in sC (F(1,32) = 8.5, ES = 1.17), sT (F(1,31) = 4.2, ES = 0.74), CMJ (F(1,28) = 26.5, ES = 1.50), and VO2max (F(1,28) = 8.5, ES = 1.10) were found. CMJ was inversely correlated with sDHEAS (r = -0.38) before PSP, while Δ of CMJ showed significant correlations with Δ of sC (r = 0.43) and ΔVO2max was inversely correlated with ΔBMI (r = -0.54) and ΔsC (r = -0.37) in all subjects. Considering each single club, ΔVO2max showed correlations with ΔBMI (r = -0.45) in AL, while ΔCMJ showed correlations with ΔPDS (r = 0.72) in LF club. Since the PSP is often limited training time to simultaneously develop physical, technical and tactical qualities, an efficient method to distribute the training load is important in youth soccer players to increase the performance and to avoid injuries."
https://openalex.org/W2990167892,"Background At-birth and point-of-care (POC) HIV testing are emerging strategies to streamline infant HIV diagnosis and expedite ART initiation for HIV-positive infants. The purpose of this qualitative study was to evaluate factors influencing the provision and acceptance of at-birth POC testing among both HIV care providers and parents of HIV-exposed infants in Kenya. Methods We conducted semi-structured interviews with 26 HIV care providers and 35 parents of HIV-exposed infants (including 23 mothers, 6 fathers, and 3 mother-father pairs) at four study hospitals prior to POC implementation. An overview of best available evidence related to POC was presented to participants prior to each interview. Interviews probed about standard EID services, perceived benefits and risk of at-birth and POC testing, and suggested logistics of providing at-birth and POC. Interviews were audio recorded, translated (if necessary), and transcribed verbatim. Using the Transdisciplinary Model of Evidence Based Practice to guide analysis, transcripts were coded based on a priori themes related to environmental context, patient characteristics, and resources. Results Most providers (24/26) and parents (30/35) held favorable attitudes towards at-birth POC testing. The potential for earlier results to improve infant care and reduce parental anxiety drove preferences for at-birth POC testing. Parents with unfavorable views towards at-birth POC testing preferred standard testing at 6 weeks so that mothers could heal after birth and have time to bond with their newborn before–possibly–learning that their child was HIV-positive. Providers identified lack of resources (shortage of staff, expertise, and space) as a barrier. Discussion While overall acceptability of at-birth POC testing among HIV care providers and parents of HIV-exposed infants may facilitate uptake, barriers remain. Applying a task-shifting approach to implementation and ensuring providers receive training on at-birth POC testing may mitigate provider-related challenges. Comprehensive counseling throughout the antenatal and postpartum periods may mitigate patient-related challenges."
https://openalex.org/W2991360616,"HTLV-1 proviral load (pVL) in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMCs) is proposed as a marker of disease progression but its role still remains controversial. The aim of this study was to evaluate the levels of HTLV-1 pVL in symptomatic patients and asymptomatic HTLV-1 carriers. In this cross-sectional study the pVL was measured by Real Time PCR in 102 asymptomatic carriers and 22 symptomatic patients (5ATLL, 15 TSP and 2 uveitis). We observed that the HTLV-1 pVL was significantly higher in symptomatic patients (median = 4.99 log10 HTLV-1 copies /106 PBMCs) compared to asymptomatic HTLV-1 carriers (median = 4.38 log10 HTLV-1 copies /106 PBMCs; p = 0.0030). A wide variation on the HTLV-1 pVL levels among asymptomatic HTLV-1 carriers was observed with some pVL as high as those observed in symptomatic patients. The asymptomatic HTLV-1 carriers were divided according to the place of birth and the highest levels of pVL were detected among patients from endemics areas from the North of Argentina. Our results reinforce the usefulness of the proviral load would be a prognostic marker of HTLV-1 disease progression. Moreover, host, viral or socio-environmental factors cannot be excluded as determinant of high proviral load."
https://openalex.org/W2991533704,"Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is a psychiatric condition that often onsets in childhood. Cognitive models underline the role of attention in the maintenance of SAD, but studies on youth populations are few, particularly those using eye tracking to measure attention. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for SAD includes interventions targeting attention, like exposure to eye contact, but the link between CBT and attention bias is largely unexplored. This study investigated attention bias in youth with SAD and the association with outcome from CBT. Latency to attend to pictures of faces with different emotions (vigilance) and latency to disengage from social stimuli (avoidance) was examined in N = 25 adolescents (aged 13–17) with SAD in relation to treatment outcome. Vigilance was operationalized as the time it took to relocate the gaze from a central position to a peripherally appearing social stimulus. The latency to disengage from a centrally located social stimulus, when a non-social stimulus appeared in the periphery, was used as a proxy for avoidance. Attention characteristics in the SAD group were compared to non-anxious (NA) controls (N = 22). Visual attention was measured using eye tracking. Participants in both the SAD and NA groups were vigilant towards angry faces, compared to neutral and happy faces. Similarly, both groups disengaged attention faster from angry faces. Adolescents with SAD who disengaged faster from social stimuli had less social anxiety after CBT. The results indicate that anxious youth display a vigilant-avoidant attention pattern to threat. However, partly inconsistent with previous research, the same pattern was observed in the NA group."
https://openalex.org/W2989668323,"How workers within an ant colony perceive and enforce colony boundaries is a defining biological feature of an ant species. Ants fall along a spectrum of social organizations ranging from single-queen, single nest societies to species with multi-queen societies in which workers exhibit colony-specific, altruistic behaviors towards non-nestmate workers from distant locations. Defining where an ant species falls along this spectrum is critical for understanding its basic ecology. Herein we quantify queen numbers, describe intraspecific aggression, and characterize the distribution of colony sizes for tawny crazy ant (Nylanderia fulva) populations in native range areas in South America as well as in their introduced range in the Southeastern United States. In both ranges, multi-queen nests are common. In the introduced range, aggressive behaviors are absent at all spatial scales tested, indicating that within the population in the Southeastern United States N. fulva is unicolonial. However, this contrasts strongly with intraspecific aggression in its South American native range. In the native range, intraspecific aggression between ants from different nests is common and ritualized. Aggression is typically one-sided and follows a stereotyped sequence of escalating behaviors that stops before actual fighting occurs. Spatial patterns of non-aggressive nest aggregation and the transitivity of non-aggressive interactions demonstrate that results of neutral arena assays usefully delineate colony boundaries. In the native range, both the spatial extent of colonies and the average number of queens encountered per nest differ between sites. This intercontinental comparison presents the first description of intraspecific aggressive behavior for this invasive ant and characterizes the variation in colony organization in the native-range, a pre-requisite to a full understanding of the origins of unicoloniality in its introduced range."
https://openalex.org/W2990022535,"Social insects such as ants can use geomagnetic field information in orientation and navigation tasks. However, few studies have assessed the effect of magnetic fields on aspects such as orientation and decision making during foraging of ants. Therefore, the present study aims to test the hypothesis that foragers of different species of ants with different foraging strategies when under effect of applied magnetic field change the patterns of search for resources and recruitment of ants. We used two species with solitary foraging strategy, Ectatomma brunneum and Neoponera inversa, and another with mass recruitment, Pheidole sp. The experiments were performed in field and laboratory conditions. We used some parameters for comparison such as speed, distance and time during foraging in the field and laboratory experiments, under normal and applied magnetic field with the coils on and off. We also performed SQUID magnetometry analysis for all species. The results demonstrate that changes in normal values of magnetic field affect workers behaviour of the three species. Thus, we can conclude that ants under the effect of applied magnetic fields can suffer significant changes in their foraging activities decreasing the flow of workers, increasing the travelled distance from the nest to the resource and back to the nest, in addition to time and distance to fetch the resource and decision-making, in both types of species, those which have mass recruitment, or forage individually, and that the three species are magnetosensitive, being affected by changes of low intensity in the local magnetic field."
https://openalex.org/W2990627742,"The phenotypic changes induced by prolonged cooling (2-12 weeks at 5 °C in the dark) of freshly formed Polyommatus icarus pupae were investigated. Cooling halted the imaginal development of pupae collected shortly after transformation from the larval stage. After cooling, the pupae were allowed to continue their developmental cycle. The wings of the eclosed specimens were investigated by optical microscopy, scanning and cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy, UV-VIS spectroscopy and microspectroscopy. The eclosed adults presented phenotypic alterations that reproduced results that we published previously for smaller groups of individuals remarkably well; these changes included i) a linear increase in the magnitude of quantified deviation from normal ventral wing patterns with increasing cooling time; ii) slight alteration of the blue coloration of males; and iii) an increasing number of blue scales on the dorsal wing surface of females with increasing cooling time. Several independent factors, including disordering of regular scale rows in males, the number of blue scales in females, eclosion probability and the probability of defect-free eclosion, showed that the cooling time can be divided into three periods: 0-4 weeks, 4-8 weeks, and 8-12 weeks, each of which is characterized by specific changes. The shift from brown female scales to first blue scales with a female-specific shape and then to blue scales with a male-specific shape with longer cooling times suggests slow decomposition of a substance governing scale formation."
https://openalex.org/W2990860894,"IL-21 is the most recently discovered common gamma-chain cytokine that promotes persistent T-cell responses in chronic infections, autoimmunity and cancer. However, the therapeutic potential of inhibiting the IL-21-BATF signaling axis, particularly in transplant rejection, remains unclear. We used heart transplant models to examine the effects of IL-21 blockade in prevention of chronic cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) using genetic knock-out and therapeutic approaches. Both wild-type C57BL/6 and IL-21-/- strains acutely rejected Balb/c skin grafts and once immunized with this skin graft, rejected Balb/c heart allografts in an accelerated fashion. However, when transplanted with heart grafts from the class-II major histocompatibility complex mutant, B6bm12 mice; wild-type recipients developed CAV, while IL-21-/- recipients were protected, even at day 100 post-transplant. Similarly, BATF-/- recipients, lacking the transcription factor BATF responsible for IL-21 production, did not develop CAV in B6-bm12 heart allografts. Strikingly, in a transient treatment protocol, the development of CAV in wild-type recipients of B6-bm12 hearts allografts was blocked by the administration of IL-21 receptor fusion protein (R-Fc). Thus, we demonstrate that CAV is regulated at least in part by IL-21 signaling and its blockade by genetic approaches or therapy with IL-21R-Fc prevents CAV in mice."
https://openalex.org/W2991442868,"Milk yield is the most important dairy sheep trait and constitutes the key genetic improvement goal via selective breeding. Mastitis is one of the most prevalent diseases, significantly impacting on animal welfare, milk yield and quality, while incurring substantial costs. Our objectives were to determine the feasibility of a concomitant genetic improvement programme for enhanced milk production and resistance to mastitis. Individual records for milk yield, and four mastitis-related traits (milk somatic cell count, California Mastitis Test score, total viable bacterial count in milk and clinical mastitis presence) were collected monthly throughout lactation for 609 ewes of the Chios breed. All ewes were genotyped with a mastitis specific custom-made 960 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array. We performed targeted genomic association studies, (co)variance component estimation and pathway enrichment analysis, and characterised gene expression levels and the extent of allelic expression imbalance. Presence of heritable variation for milk yield was confirmed. There was no significant genetic correlation between milk yield and mastitis traits. Environmental factors appeared to favour both milk production and udder health. There were no overlapping of SNPs associated with mastitis resistance and milk yield in Chios sheep. Furthermore, four distinct Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) affecting milk yield were detected on chromosomes 2, 12, 16 and 19, in locations other than those previously identified to affect mastitis resistance. Five genes (DNAJA1, GHR, LYPLA1, NUP35 and OXCT1) located within the QTL regions were highly expressed in both the mammary gland and milk transcriptome, suggesting involvement in milk synthesis and production. Furthermore, the expression of two of these genes (NUP35 and OXCT1) was enriched in immune tissues implying a potentially pleiotropic effect or likely role in milk production during udder infection, which needs to be further elucidated in future studies. In conclusion, the absence of genetic antagonism between milk yield and mastitis resistance suggests that simultaneous genetic improvement of both traits be achievable."

These droplets can be dispersed in the atmosphere several kilometers from their source. The most common such sources are contaminated water within cooling towers and other air-conditioning systems but other sources such as ornamental fountains and spa pools have also caused outbreaks of the disease in the past. There is an obvious need to locate and eliminate any such sources as quickly as possible. Here a maximum likelihood model estimating the source of an outbreak from case location data has been developed and implemented. Unlike previous models, the average dose exposure sub-model is formulated using a atmospheric dispersion model. How the uncertainty in inferred parameters can be estimated is discussed.

https://openalex.org/W2990105384,"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been reported to play key regulatory roles in plant growth, development, and biotic and abiotic stress physiology. Revealing the mechanism of lncRNA regulation in the albino portions of leaves is important for understanding the development of chimeric leaves in Ananas comosus var. bracteatus. In this study, a total of 3,543 candidate lncRNAs were identified, among which 1,451 were differentially expressed between completely green (CGr) and completely white (CWh) leaves. LncRNAs tend to have shorter transcripts, lower expression levels, and greater expression specificity than protein-coding genes. Predicted lncRNA targets were functionally annotated by the Gene Ontology (GO), Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases. A lncRNA-mRNA interaction network was constructed, and 36 target mRNAs related to chlorophyll metabolism were predicted to interact with 86 lncRNAs. Among these, 25 significantly differentially expressed lncRNAs putatively interacted with 16 target mRNAs. Based on an expression pattern analysis of the lncRNAs and their target mRNAs, the lncRNAs targeting magnesium chelatase subunit H (ChlH), protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (POR), and heme o synthase (COX10) were suggested as key regulators of chlorophyll metabolism. This study provides the first lncRNA database for A. comosus var. bracteatus and contributes greatly to understanding the mechanism of epigenetic regulation of leaf albinism."
https://openalex.org/W2990618111,"Analyses of the Journal Impact Factor (JIF) have grown to be a major topic in scientometric literature. Despite widespread and justified critique concerning the JIF and its application, the size of a journal as a predictor for its longitudinal variability-or stability-on a long-term level has not yet comprehensively been analyzed. This study aims to provide robust evidence for an association between JIF variability and the size of journals, expressed by the number of published articles (citable items). For this purpose, the complete set of journals included in the Incite Journal Citation Reports (JCR) with an JIF in the 2017 JCR edition (n = 8750) were analyzed for the association between journal size and longitudinal JIF dynamics. Our results, based on n = 4792 journals with a complete JIF data set over the timespan of 12 annual JIF changes show that larger journals publishing more citable items experience smaller annual changes of the JIF than smaller journals, yet with this association being reversed for journals with a very large number of total cites. Consequently and in accordance with the genuine intention of the JIF to serve as a basis for decisions on journal subscriptions, evaluation of current changes of the JIF have to be accompanied by consideration of the journal's size in order to be accurate and sensible."
https://openalex.org/W2990959093,"This study examines two theoretical explanations for the existence of close ties among continuing care retirement community residents: the attractiveness theory, which suggests that residents who possess certain attributes are more likely to be perceived as appealing to others; and the homophily theory, which argues that individuals are more likely to have close ties with people who share similar attributes. As a variant of the homophily theory, we also examined whether sharing a physical location makes the existence of certain connections more likely. Data from four continuing care retirement communities were used. To test the attractiveness theory, correlations between the number of individuals who named a person as a significant contact (ego’s in-degree) and ego attributes were examined. To test the homophily theory, the median value of existing ties was compared against all possible social ties as though they were randomly formed. Finally, to further test the role of the institutional culture against various motivations that drive social ties—attractiveness and homophily—we used link prediction models with random forests. In support of the homophily theory, beyond the institutional culture, the only consistent predictor of the existence of close ties among residents was sharing a wing in the retirement community (geographic proximity). Therefore, we discuss the role of the physical location in the lives of older adults."

By integrating these microreactors with onboard analytical systems, the devices change from passive ones to active ones, increasing their functionality and usefulness. A pressing application for these active microreactors is the monitoring of reaction progress and intermediaries with respect to time, shedding light on important information about these real-time synthetic processes.In this multi-disciplinary study the objective was to utilise advanced digital fabrication to research metallic, active microreactors with integrated fibre optics for reaction progress monitoring of solvent based liquids, incompatible with previously researched polymer devices, in combination with on-board Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy for real-time reaction monitoring.A solid-state, metal-based additive manufactured system (Ultrasonic Additive Manufacturing) combined with focussed ion beam milling, that permitted the accurate embedment of delicate sensory elements directly at the point of need within aluminium layers, was researched as a method to create active, metallic, flow reactors with on-board sensing. This outcome was then used to characterise and correctly identify concentrations of UV-active water-soluble B-vitamin nicotinamide and fluorescein. A dilution series was formed from 0.01-1.75 mM; which was pumped through the research device and monitored using UV-vis spectroscopy.The results uniquely showed the in-situ ion milling of ultrasonically embedded optical fibres resulted in a metallic microfluidic reaction and monitoring device capable of measuring solvent solutions from 18 μM to 18 mM of nicotinamide and fluorescein, in real time.

We tested whether these perfusions can reduce the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence in a 1h-DCD syngeneic transplantation model, using Fischer F344 rats. DCD grafts were machine perfused for 2h with hypothermic perfusion (HOPE) or normothermic perfusion (NORMO), and transplanted. After reperfusion, we injected HCC cells into the vena porta. On day 28 after transplantation, we assessed tumour volumes by MRI. Control rats included transplantations with Fresh and non-perfused DCD livers. We observed apoptotic-necrotic hepatocyte foci in all DCD grafts, which were more visible than in the Fresh liver grafts. Normothermic perfusion allowed a faster post-transplant recovery, with lower day 1 levels of transaminases compared with the other DCD. Overall, survival was similar in all four groups and all animals developed HCCs. Total tumor volume was lower in the Fresh liver recipients compared to the DCD and DCD+HOPE recipients. Volumes in DCD+NORMO recipients were not significantly different from those in the Fresh group. This experiment confirms that ischemia/reperfusion injury promotes HCC cell engraftment/growth after DCD liver transplantation. Using the present extreme 1h ischemia model, both hypothermic and normothermic perfusions were not effective in reducing this risk."
https://openalex.org/W2991218958,"Oxygen uptake (MO2; mgO2 fish-1h-1) of fish groups was measured at temperatures between 10–19°C in an intermittent-flow respirometer to quantify the metabolic costs of spontaneous swimming patterns in the small clupeid Sprattus sprattus. Movements of individual fish within the school were tracked automatically during respirometry. Oxygen uptake was then related to mean swimming speeds and the number of sharp turns (>90°), which are common behavioural elements of spontaneous swimming in clupeid fish. Different possible model formulations for describing the relationship between respiration and swimming patterns were compared via the AIC. The final model revealed that costs for sharp turns at a frequency of 1 s-1 doubled the metabolic costs compared to those with zero turns but with likewise a moderate swimming speed of 0.28 body length -1. The cost for swimming doubled if the swimming speed was doubled from 0.28 to 0.56 BLs-1 but increased by a factor of 4.5 if tripled to 0.84 BLs-1. Costs for transport were minimal at a speed of 0.4 body lengths s-1 at all temperatures. New basic input parameters to estimate energy losses during spontaneous movements, which occur typically during foraging in this small pelagic fish, are provided."

A multifaceted program has been recommended to manage the swelling. However, there is little evidence investigating patients’ perspectives following the program, particularly for those who have poor adherence and/or are disengaged. Aim To investigate the perceived challenges faced by disengaged participants with lower limb CO by identifying their enablers and barriers to participating in a Physiotherapy CO program. Method An exploratory qualitative approach was used. A purposive sampling strategy was adopted to recruit participants. Those with more than three months swelling and who had low adherence and/or attendance (disengaged) to the CO program were invited to participate. Semi-structured interviews with six participants from a CO clinic in a tertiary hospital were conducted. Data were thematically analyzed and findings in terms of enablers and barriers were subsequently reflected in the light of a theoretical framework. Results All six participants were morbidly obese (BMI 47 ± 4 kg/m2) with multiple chronic comorbidities. Enablers and barriers detected included physical, psychological and social factors that interplay to present multidimensional challenges that influence the participants’ adjustment to managing their CO. For the disengaged participants in this study, their under-managed lower limb CO was a progression towards being housebound and having a gradually increasing level of disability. Conclusion This study has identified the multidimensional challenges faced by low adherent and/or disengaged participants with lower limb CO to participating in a hospital-based CO program. Perceived enablers and barriers included physical, psychological and social factors. These were mapped using a health behavior change theoretical framework. Understanding these challenges has implications for developing a multidisciplinary approach aimed at enhancing patient engagement and participation in the physiotherapy CO program."
https://openalex.org/W2990352633,"Women in South Africa experience high levels of Intimate Partner Violence (IPV). There are numerous health consequences experienced by victims. However, children of IPV victims often experience negative emotional and developmental outcomes as well. In South Africa, infant and child health outcomes are not optimal and IPV is high, and thus there is a need to determine whether a relationship between them exists. This study used the 2016 South African Demographic and Health Survey. Mothers aged 15 to 49 and who were included in the Domestic Violence module formed the study population. Frequency tables and graphs were done, and unadjusted and adjusted logistic regressions were performed with each of the three reported child health outcomes (birth weight, duration of breastfeeding and diarrhoea incidence), IPV and other socio-demographic factors. Thirteen percent of women have experienced IPV. Five percent of their children were low birth weight, 10% had experienced diarrhoea; but 87% had been breastfed for 6+ months. Mothers in the rich wealth category were 37% more likely to have a child born at low birth weight but those aged 20 to 39 had around a 60% less likelihood of breastfeeding for 6+ months than 15 to 19-year olds. Women who had experienced IPV had around 77% higher odds of having a child experience diarrhoea in the last 2 weeks. Wealthier mothers often have unhealthier lifestyle practices and behaviours, due to more disposable income which could account for lower birth weight children. Mothers in tertiary education and starting their professional careers are normally around 20 to 39 years and should be provided supportive structures to be allowed to breastfeed their children. The long-term emotional and developmental consequences to children of IPV victims are known, but we now know that there are also very immediate consequences to the health of these children as well."
