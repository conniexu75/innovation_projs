https://openalex.org/W3187309064,"Non-genetic mechanisms have recently emerged as important drivers of cancer therapy failure1, where some cancer cells can enter a reversible drug-tolerant persister state in response to treatment2. Although most cancer persisters remain arrested in the presence of the drug, a rare subset can re-enter the cell cycle under constitutive drug treatment. Little is known about the non-genetic mechanisms that enable cancer persisters to maintain proliferative capacity in the presence of drugs. To study this rare, transiently resistant, proliferative persister population, we developed Watermelon, a high-complexity expressed barcode lentiviral library for simultaneous tracing of each cell’s clonal origin and proliferative and transcriptional states. Here we show that cycling and non-cycling persisters arise from different cell lineages with distinct transcriptional and metabolic programs. Upregulation of antioxidant gene programs and a metabolic shift to fatty acid oxidation are associated with persister proliferative capacity across multiple cancer types. Impeding oxidative stress or metabolic reprogramming alters the fraction of cycling persisters. In human tumours, programs associated with cycling persisters are induced in minimal residual disease in response to multiple targeted therapies. The Watermelon system enabled the identification of rare persister lineages that are preferentially poised to proliferate under drug pressure, thus exposing new vulnerabilities that can be targeted to delay or even prevent disease recurrence. Lineage tracing by barcoding of individual cells using a lentivirus library shows that cycling and non-cycling drug-tolerant persister cells in cancer arise from different lineages with distinct transcriptional and metabolic programs."

https://openalex.org/W3191830829,"Loss of skeletal integrity during ageing and disease is associated with an imbalance in the opposing actions of osteoblasts and osteoclasts1. Here we show that intrinsic ageing of skeletal stem cells (SSCs)2 in mice alters signalling in the bone marrow niche and skews the differentiation of bone and blood lineages, leading to fragile bones that regenerate poorly. Functionally, aged SSCs have a decreased bone- and cartilage-forming potential but produce more stromal lineages that express high levels of pro-inflammatory and pro-resorptive cytokines. Single-cell RNA-sequencing studies link the functional loss to a diminished transcriptomic diversity of SSCs in aged mice, which thereby contributes to the transformation of the bone marrow niche. Exposure to a youthful circulation through heterochronic parabiosis or systemic reconstitution with young haematopoietic stem cells did not reverse the diminished osteochondrogenic activity of aged SSCs, or improve bone mass or skeletal healing parameters in aged mice. Conversely, the aged SSC lineage promoted osteoclastic activity and myeloid skewing by haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, suggesting that the ageing of SSCs is a driver of haematopoietic ageing. Deficient bone regeneration in aged mice could only be returned to youthful levels by applying a combinatorial treatment of BMP2 and a CSF1 antagonist locally to fractures, which reactivated aged SSCs and simultaneously ablated the inflammatory, pro-osteoclastic milieu. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into the complex, multifactorial mechanisms that underlie skeletal ageing and offer prospects for rejuvenating the aged skeletal system."
https://openalex.org/W3192342444,"Room-temperature optoelectronic devices that operate at short-wavelength and mid-wavelength infrared ranges (one to eight micrometres) can be used for numerous applications1-5. To achieve the range of operating wavelengths needed for a given application, a combination of materials with different bandgaps (for example, superlattices or heterostructures)6,7 or variations in the composition of semiconductor alloys during growth8,9 are used. However, these materials are complex to fabricate, and the operating range is fixed after fabrication. Although wide-range, active and reversible tunability of the operating wavelengths in optoelectronic devices after fabrication is a highly desirable feature, no such platform has been yet developed. Here we demonstrate high-performance room-temperature infrared optoelectronics with actively variable spectra by presenting black phosphorus as an ideal candidate. Enabled by the highly strain-sensitive nature of its bandgap, which varies from 0.22 to 0.53 electronvolts, we show a continuous and reversible tuning of the operating wavelengths in light-emitting diodes and photodetectors composed of black phosphorus. Furthermore, we leverage this platform to demonstrate multiplexed nondispersive infrared gas sensing, whereby multiple gases (for example, carbon dioxide, methane and water vapour) are detected using a single light source. With its active spectral tunability while also retaining high performance, our work bridges a technological gap, presenting a potential way of meeting different requirements for emission and detection spectra in optoelectronic applications."
https://openalex.org/W3190135694,"Mutations causing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) often affect the condensation properties of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). However, the role of RBP condensation in the specificity and function of protein-RNA complexes remains unclear. We created a series of TDP-43 C-terminal domain (CTD) variants that exhibited a gradient of low to high condensation propensity, as observed in vitro and by nuclear mobility and foci formation. Notably, a capacity for condensation was required for efficient TDP-43 assembly on subsets of RNA-binding regions, which contain unusually long clusters of motifs of characteristic types and density. These ""binding-region condensates"" are promoted by homomeric CTD-driven interactions and required for efficient regulation of a subset of bound transcripts, including autoregulation of TDP-43 mRNA. We establish that RBP condensation can occur in a binding-region-specific manner to selectively modulate transcriptome-wide RNA regulation, which has implications for remodeling RNA networks in the context of signaling, disease, and evolution."
https://openalex.org/W3190811994,"Abstract Maternal care, including by non-biological parents, is important for offspring survival 1–8 . Oxytocin 1,2,9–15 , which is released by the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN), is a critical maternal hormone. In mice, oxytocin enables neuroplasticity in the auditory cortex for maternal recognition of pup distress 15 . However, it is unclear how initial parental experience promotes hypothalamic signalling and cortical plasticity for reliable maternal care. Here we continuously monitored the behaviour of female virgin mice co-housed with an experienced mother and litter. This documentary approach was synchronized with neural recordings from the virgin PVN, including oxytocin neurons. These cells were activated as virgins were enlisted in maternal care by experienced mothers, who shepherded virgins into the nest and demonstrated pup retrieval. Virgins visually observed maternal retrieval, which activated PVN oxytocin neurons and promoted alloparenting. Thus rodents can acquire maternal behaviour by social transmission, providing a mechanism for adapting the brains of adult caregivers to infant needs via endogenous oxytocin."
https://openalex.org/W3189057580,"<h2>Summary</h2> Utilizing recent advances in machine learning, we introduce a systematic approach to characterize neurons' input/output (I/O) mapping complexity. Deep neural networks (DNNs) were trained to faithfully replicate the I/O function of various biophysical models of cortical neurons at millisecond (spiking) resolution. A temporally convolutional DNN with five to eight layers was required to capture the I/O mapping of a realistic model of a layer 5 cortical pyramidal cell (L5PC). This DNN generalized well when presented with inputs widely outside the training distribution. When NMDA receptors were removed, a much simpler network (fully connected neural network with one hidden layer) was sufficient to fit the model. Analysis of the DNNs' weight matrices revealed that synaptic integration in dendritic branches could be conceptualized as pattern matching from a set of spatiotemporal templates. This study provides a unified characterization of the computational complexity of single neurons and suggests that cortical networks therefore have a unique architecture, potentially supporting their computational power."
https://openalex.org/W3191154272,"Animal bodies are composed of cell types with unique expression programs that implement their distinct locations, shapes, structures, and functions. Based on these properties, cell types assemble into specific tissues and organs. To systematically explore the link between cell-type-specific gene expression and morphology, we registered an expression atlas to a whole-body electron microscopy volume of the nereid Platynereis dumerilii. Automated segmentation of cells and nuclei identifies major cell classes and establishes a link between gene activation, chromatin topography, and nuclear size. Clustering of segmented cells according to gene expression reveals spatially coherent tissues. In the brain, genetically defined groups of neurons match ganglionic nuclei with coherent projections. Besides interneurons, we uncover sensory-neurosecretory cells in the nereid mushroom bodies, which thus qualify as sensory organs. They furthermore resemble the vertebrate telencephalon by molecular anatomy. We provide an integrated browser as a Fiji plugin for remote exploration of all available multimodal datasets."
https://openalex.org/W3190034652,"Research on magnetic confinement of high-temperature plasmas has the ultimate goal of harnessing nuclear fusion for the production of electricity. Although the tokamak1 is the leading toroidal magnetic-confinement concept, it is not without shortcomings and the fusion community has therefore also pursued alternative concepts such as the stellarator. Unlike axisymmetric tokamaks, stellarators possess a three-dimensional (3D) magnetic field geometry. The availability of this additional dimension opens up an extensive configuration space for computational optimization of both the field geometry itself and the current-carrying coils that produce it. Such an optimization was undertaken in designing Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X)2, a large helical-axis advanced stellarator (HELIAS), which began operation in 2015 at Greifswald, Germany. A major drawback of 3D magnetic field geometry, however, is that it introduces a strong temperature dependence into the stellarator's non-turbulent 'neoclassical' energy transport. Indeed, such energy losses will become prohibitive in high-temperature reactor plasmas unless a strong reduction of the geometrical factor associated with this transport can be achieved; such a reduction was therefore a principal goal of the design of W7-X. In spite of the modest heating power currently available, W7-X has already been able to achieve high-temperature plasma conditions during its 2017 and 2018 experimental campaigns, producing record values of the fusion triple product for such stellarator plasmas3,4. The triple product of plasma density, ion temperature and energy confinement time is used in fusion research as a figure of merit, as it must attain a certain threshold value before net-energy-producing operation of a reactor becomes possible1,5. Here we demonstrate that such record values provide evidence for reduced neoclassical energy transport in W7-X, as the plasma profiles that produced these results could not have been obtained in stellarators lacking a comparably high level of neoclassical optimization."
https://openalex.org/W3192972855,"Single-particle cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has become a standard technique for determining protein structures at atomic resolution1–3. However, cryo-EM studies of protein-free RNA are in their early days. The Tetrahymena thermophila group I self-splicing intron was the first ribozyme to be discovered and has been a prominent model system for the study of RNA catalysis and structure–function relationships4, but its full structure remains unknown. Here we report cryo-EM structures of the full-length Tetrahymena ribozyme in substrate-free and bound states at a resolution of 3.1 Å. Newly resolved peripheral regions form two coaxially stacked helices; these are interconnected by two kissing loop pseudoknots that wrap around the catalytic core and include two previously unforeseen (to our knowledge) tertiary interactions. The global architecture is nearly identical in both states; only the internal guide sequence and guanosine binding site undergo a large conformational change and a localized shift, respectively, upon binding of RNA substrates. These results provide a long-sought structural view of a paradigmatic RNA enzyme and signal a new era for the cryo-EM-based study of structure–function relationships in ribozymes. Cryo-electron microscopy has been used to determine the structure of the Tetrahymena ribozyme (a catalytic RNA) at sufficiently high resolution to model side chains and metal ions."
https://openalex.org/W3191965276,"The hippocampus has previously been implicated in both cognitive and endocrine functions1-15. We simultaneously measured electrophysiological activity from the hippocampus and interstitial glucose concentrations in the body of freely behaving rats to identify an activity pattern that may link these disparate functions of the hippocampus. Here we report that clusters of sharp wave-ripples recorded from the hippocampus reliably predicted a decrease in peripheral glucose concentrations within about 10 min. This correlation was not dependent on circadian, ultradian or meal-triggered fluctuations, could be mimicked with optogenetically induced ripples in the hippocampus (but not in the parietal cortex) and was attenuated to chance levels by pharmacogenetically suppressing activity of the lateral septum, which is the major conduit between the hippocampus and the hypothalamus. Our findings demonstrate that a function of the sharp wave-ripple is to modulate peripheral glucose homeostasis, and offer a mechanism for the link between sleep disruption and blood glucose dysregulation in type 2 diabetes16-18."

https://openalex.org/W3188166099,"Abstract We investigated how entorhinal grid cells encode volumetric space. On a horizontal surface, grid cells usually produce multiple, spatially focal, approximately circular firing fields that are evenly sized and spaced to form a regular, close-packed, hexagonal array. This spatial regularity has been suggested to underlie navigational computations. In three dimensions, theoretically the equivalent firing pattern would be a regular, hexagonal close packing of evenly sized spherical fields. In the present study, we report that, in rats foraging in a cubic lattice, grid cells maintained normal temporal firing characteristics and produced spatially stable firing fields. However, although most grid fields were ellipsoid, they were sparser, larger, more variably sized and irregularly arranged, even when only fields abutting the lower surface (equivalent to the floor) were considered. Thus, grid self-organization is shaped by the environment’s structure and/or movement affordances, and grids may not need to be regular to support spatial computations."
https://openalex.org/W3192403152,"Background The primary goal of the presented cross-sectional observational study was to determine the clinical and demographic risk factors for adverse coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes in the Pakistani population. Methods We examined the individuals (n = 6331) that consulted two private diagnostic centers in Lahore, Pakistan, for COVID-19 testing between May 1, 2020, and November 30, 2020. The attending nurse collected clinical and demographic information. A confirmed case of COVID-19 was defined as having a positive result through real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay of nasopharyngeal swab specimens. Results RT-PCR testing was positive in 1094 cases. Out of which, 5.2% had severe, and 20.8% had mild symptoms. We observed a strong association of COVID-19 severity with the number and type of comorbidities. The severity of the disease intensified as the number of comorbidities increased. The most vulnerable groups for the poor outcome are patients with diabetes and hypertension. Increasing age was also associated with PCR positivity and the severity of the disease. Conclusions Most cases of COVID-19 included in this study developed mild symptoms or were asymptomatic. Risk factors for adverse outcomes included older age and the simultaneous presence of comorbidities."
https://openalex.org/W3192432744,"Abstract Topological superfluidity is an important concept in electronic materials as well as ultracold atomic gases 1 . However, although progress has been made by hybridizing superconductors with topological substrates, the search for a material—natural or artificial—that intrinsically exhibits topological superfluidity has been ongoing since the discovery of the superfluid 3 He-A phase 2 . Here we report evidence for a globally chiral atomic superfluid, induced by interaction-driven time-reversal symmetry breaking in the second Bloch band of an optical lattice with hexagonal boron nitride geometry. This realizes a long-lived Bose–Einstein condensate of 87 Rb atoms beyond present limits to orbitally featureless scenarios in the lowest Bloch band. Time-of-flight and band mapping measurements reveal that the local phases and orbital rotations of atoms are spontaneously ordered into a vortex array, showing evidence of the emergence of global angular momentum across the entire lattice. A phenomenological effective model is used to capture the dynamics of Bogoliubov quasi-particle excitations above the ground state, which are shown to exhibit a topological band structure. The observed bosonic phase is expected to exhibit phenomena that are conceptually distinct from, but related to, the quantum anomalous Hall effect 3–7 in electronic condensed matter."
https://openalex.org/W3191024687,"Background Hepatic and biliary diseases are prevalent worldwide, but the majority of people lack access to diagnostic medical imaging for their assessment. The liver and gallbladder are readily amenable to sonographic examination, and ultrasound is a portable, cost-effective imaging modality suitable for use in rural and underserved areas. However, the deployment of ultrasound in these settings is limited by the lack of experienced sonographers to perform the exam. In this study, we tested an asynchronous telediagnostic system for right upper quadrant abdominal ultrasound examination operated by individuals without prior ultrasound experience to facilitate deployment of ultrasound to rural and underserved areas. Methods The teleultrasound system utilized in this study employs volume sweep imaging and a telemedicine app installed on a tablet which connects to an ultrasound machine. Volume sweep imaging is an ultrasound technique in which an individual scans the target region utilizing preset ultrasound sweeps demarcated by easily recognized external body landmarks. The sweeps are saved as video clips for later interpretation by an experienced radiologist. Teleultrasound scans from a Peruvian clinic obtained by individuals without prior ultrasound experience were sent to the United States for remote interpretation and quality assessment. Standard of care comparison was made to a same-day ultrasound examination performed by a radiologist. Results Individuals without prior ultrasound experience scanned 144 subjects. Image quality was rated “poor” on 36.8% of exams, “acceptable” on 38.9% of exams, and “excellent” on 24.3% of exams. Among telemedicine exams of “acceptable” or “excellent” image quality (n = 91), greater than 80% of the liver and gallbladder were visualized in the majority of cases. In this group, there was 95% agreement between standard of care and teleultrasound on whether an exam was normal or abnormal, with a Cohen’s kappa of 0.84 (95% CI 0.7–0.98, p &lt;0.0001). Finally, among these teleultrasound exams of “acceptable” or “excellent” image quality, the sensitivity for cholelithiasis was 93% (95% CI 68.1%-99.8%), and the specificity was 97% (95% CI 89.5%-99.6%). Conclusion This asynchronous telediagnostic system allows individuals without prior ultrasound experience to effectively scan the liver, gallbladder, and right kidney with a high degree of agreement with standard of care ultrasound. This system can be deployed to improve access to diagnostic imaging in low-resource areas."
https://openalex.org/W3192402987,"Evolution is a prominent component of biology education and remains controversial among college biology students in the United States who are mostly Christian, but science education researchers have not explored the attitudes of Muslim biology students in the United States. To explore perceptions of evolution among Muslim students in the United States, we surveyed 7,909 college students in 52 biology classes in 13 states about their acceptance of evolution, interest in evolution, and understanding of evolution. Muslim students in our sample, on average, did not agree with items that measured acceptance of macroevolution and human evolution. Further, on average, Muslim students agreed, but did not strongly agree with items measuring microevolution acceptance. Controlling for gender, major, race/ethnicity, and international status, we found that the evolution acceptance and interest levels of Muslim students were slightly higher than Protestant students and students who are members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. However, Muslim student evolution acceptance levels were significantly lower than Catholic, Jewish, Buddhist, and Hindu students as well as students who did not identify with a religion (agnostic and atheists). Muslim student understanding of evolution was similar to students from other affiliations, but was lower than agnostic and atheist students. We also examined which variables are associated with Muslim student acceptance of evolution and found that higher understanding of evolution and lower religiosity are positive predictors of evolution acceptance among Muslim students, which is similar to the broader population of biology students. These data are the first to document that Muslim students have lower acceptance of evolution compared to students from other affiliations in undergraduate biology classrooms in the United States."
https://openalex.org/W3188954842,"To investigate the association between family cancer caregivers' unmet daily needs and emotional states of depression, anxiety and stress across their care recipient's treatment phases.A cross-sectional study design and self-report questionnaires were used. Family caregivers (N = 237) of cancer patients in ambulatory cancer clinics were recruited from May to December 2017, and completed a sociodemographic and medical questionnaire, the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale and Needs Assessment of Family Caregivers-Cancer Scale. Hierarchical linear regression was conducted to examine the influence of each predictor (sociodemographic variables, unmet personal care and role management needs, cancer treatment phase) on the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale total score, depression subscale, anxiety subscale, and the stress subscale.Family caregivers' unmet daily activity needs, in particular higher unmet personal care needs, during the intermediate phase (6-9 months), were significantly associated (ps<0.05) with overall distress (b = 4.93) and stress (b = 2.26). In the chronic treatment phase (>9 months), the significant association of unmet personal care needs was with overall distress (b = 5.91), anxiety (b = 1.97) and stress (b = 2.53). After completing treatment, unmet role management needs were only significantly associated with stress (b = -1.59). Caregivers' higher depression was also associated with greater unmet role management needs, regardless of treatment phases.Intermediate and chronic cancer treatment phases were identified as having greatest effect on caregivers' unmet daily activity needs and emotions. Unmet personal care needs played the major effect on overall negative emotional states in the intermediate treatment phase and stress in the chronic treatment phase. Close attention to caregivers needs in intermediate and chronic treatment phases, would be highly beneficial in alleviating negative emotional disturbances."
https://openalex.org/W3188422462,"Background Pulmonary tumor embolism (PTE) is difficult to detect before death, and it is unclear whether the discrepancy between antemortem clinical and postmortem diagnosis improves with the advance of the diagnostic technologies. In this study we determined the incidence of PTE and analyzed the discrepancy between antemortem clinical and postmortem diagnosis. Methods We performed a retrospective autopsy study on patients with the history of malignant solid tumors from 1990 to 2020 and reviewed all the slides of the patients with PTE. We also analyzed the discrepancies between antemortem clinical and postmortem diagnosis in 1999, 2009 and 2019 by using the Goldman criteria. Goldman category major 1 refers to cases in which an autopsy diagnosis was the direct cause of death and was not recognized clinically, but if it had been recognized, it may have changed treatment or prolonged survival. Results We found 20 (3%) cases with PTE out of the 658 autopsy cases with solid malignancies. Out of these 20 cases, urothelial carcinoma (30%, 6/20) and invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast (4/20, 20%) were the most common primary malignancies. Seven patients with shortness of breath died within 3–17 days (average 8.4±2.2 days) after onset of the symptoms. Pulmonary embolism was clinically suspected in seven out of twenty (35%, 7/20) patients before death, but only two patients (10, 2/20) were diagnosed by imaging studies before death. The rate of Goldman category major 1 was 13.2% (10/76) in 1999, 7.3% (4/55) in 2009 and 6.9% (8/116) in 2019. Although the rate of Goldman category major 1 appeared decreasing, the difference was not statistically significant. The autopsy rate was significantly higher in 2019 (8.4%, 116/1386) than in 2009 (4.4%, 55/1240). Conclusions The incidence of PTE is uncommon. Despite the advances of the radiological techniques, radiological imaging studies did not detect the majority of PTEs. The discrepancy between the antemortem clinical and the postmortem diagnosis has not improved significantly over the past 30 years, emphasizing the value of autopsy."
https://openalex.org/W3189345255,"Introduction Cranial cruciate ligament failure is one of the principal causes of canine lameness. Several surgical procedures were proposed to achieve joint stabilisation; among these, the Modified Maquet Procedure involves using a titanium foam wedge to achieve and maintain the tibial tuberosity advancement. The force-plate analysis provides to objectively assess normal and abnormal gait and the outcome of different surgical techniques. The study evaluates the outcome of limbs that underwent Modified Maquet Procedure using land-force plate analysis comparing the operated limb with its healthy contralateral one as a control. Materials and methods Thirty-five dogs with unilateral cranial cruciate ligament rupture were evaluated. Outcome after surgery was assessed by orthopaedic and radiographic evaluations and force plate gait analysis performed before surgery, at 15, 30 and 90 days after surgery. For objective comparison of ground reaction forces, data of operated limb were compared to contralateral limb on each time control and Symmetry Index at 90 days was determined. Healing radiographic signs, minor and major complication were reported. Results A significant improvement in ground reaction forces was reached in all the treated limbs between set time intervals. The median percentage increase in ground reaction forces was constant from 15 to 90 days, with a Symmetry Index &gt;9 in 54.2% of patients suggesting a normal gait symmetry. A complete bone healing was noticed at 90 days follow-up radiographic assessment. We experienced three major (8.5%) and one minor (2.8%) complications. Conclusions To the Authors’ knowledge, this is the first study in the veterinary literature that assessed outcomes of dogs undergoing Modified Maquet Procedure for the treatment of cranial cruciate ligament rupture using force plate gait analysis and healthy contralateral limb as a control group. Our results confirm that Modified Maquet Procedure is an effective method to stabilise the stifle joint."
https://openalex.org/W3189374950,"Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic rapidly increases the use of mechanical ventilation (MV). Such cases further require extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and have a high mortality. Objective We aimed to identify prognostic biomarkers pathophysiologically reflecting future deterioration of COVID-19. Methods Clinical, laboratory, and outcome data were collected from 102 patients with moderate to severe COVID-19. Interleukin (IL)-6 level and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA copy number in plasma were assessed with ELISA kit and quantitative PCR. Results Twelve patients died or required ECMO owing to acute respiratory distress syndrome despite the use of MV. Among various variables, a ratio of oxygen saturation to fraction of inspired oxygen (SpO2/FiO2), IL-6, and SARS-CoV-2 RNA on admission before intubation were strongly predictive of fatal outcomes after the MV use. Moreover, among these variables, combining SpO2/FiO2, IL-6, and SARS-CoV-2 RNA showed the highest accuracy (area under the curve: 0.934). In patients with low SpO2/FiO2 (&lt; 261), fatal event-rate after the MV use at the 30-day was significantly higher in patients with high IL-6 (&gt; 49 pg/mL) and SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia (&gt; 1.5 copies/μL) compared to those with high IL-6 or RNAaemia or without high IL-6 and RNAaemia (88% vs. 22% or 8%, log-rank test P = 0.0097 or P &lt; 0.0001, respectively). Conclusions Combining SpO2/FiO2 with high IL-6 and SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia which reflect hyperinflammation and viral overload allows accurately and before intubation identifying COVID-19 patients at high risk for ECMO use or in-hospital death despite the use of MV."
https://openalex.org/W3192168956,"Factors contributing to the accurate measurement of self-reported physical activity are not well understood in middle-aged adults. We investigated the associations between two self-reported surveys and objectively measured physical activity in middle-aged adults, and the influence of individual and sociodemographic factors on these associations, at different intensities utilizing an observational study design.Participants (n = 156) wore a SenseWear Armband™ (SWA) for a continuous seven-day period over the triceps of the left arm, to measure energy expenditure in metabolic equivalents. Participants also completed the Physical Activity Recall questionnaire (PAR) and Active Australia Survey (AAS). Associations were analyzed separately in general linear models for each intensity. The influence of individual and sociodemographic factors was assessed through moderator analyses.The PAR and SWA were significantly positively associated at moderate (β = 0.68, 95% CI 0.16-1.20), vigorous (β = 0.36, 95% CI 0.20-0.53), moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) (β = 0.52, 95% CI 0.20-0.83), and total METmins (β = 0.63, 95% CI 0.35-0.90), the AAS and SWA were associated at all intensities (moderate (β = 0.41, 95% CI 0.15-0.67), vigorous (β = 0.32, 95% CI 0.19-0.46), MVPA (β = 0.42, 95% CI 0.18-0.65) and total METmins (β = 0.62, 95% CI 0.29-0.96). A significant interaction between the PAR and sex for vigorous-intensity unveiled a weaker association in women. Both surveys tended to under-report physical activity. The largest margins of error were present at light and moderate intensities. For the PAR, participants reported over 20 hours, or 69% less light physical activity than recorded by the SWA per week. For the AAS, participants reported over 7 hours, or 38% less moderate physical activity. Compared to lighter intensities, time spent at a vigorous intensity was overreported by participants with the PAR and AAS by 91 and 43 minutes per week, respectively. The addition of Body Mass Index (BMI) resulted in non-significant interactions between the PAR and SWA for moderate-intensity, and the AAS and SWA for vigorous-intensity; a significant interaction between AAS and BMI indicated that the strength of the association differed by BMI for vigorous-intensity.The PAR and AAS are not equivalent to the SWA, and sex and BMI may alter the associations between the measures."
https://openalex.org/W3188826583,"Effective patient prognosis necessitates identification of novel tumor promoting drivers of gastric cancer (GC) which contribute to worsened conditions by analysing TCGA-gastric adenocarcinoma dataset. Small leucine-rich proteoglycans, asporin (ASPN) and decorin (DCN), play overlapping roles in development and diseases; however, the mechanisms underlying their interplay remain elusive. Here, we investigated the complex interplay of asporin, decorin and their interaction with TGFβ in GC tumor and corresponding normal tissues. The mRNA levels, protein expressions and cellular localizations of ASPN and DCN were analyzed using real-time PCR, western blot and immunohistochemistry, respectively. The protein-protein interaction was predicted by in-silico interaction analysis and validated by co-immunoprecipitation assay. The correlations between ASPN and EMT proteins, VEGF and collagen were achieved using western blot analysis. A significant increase in expression of ASPN in tumor tissue vs. normal tissue was observed in both TCGA and our patient cohort. DCN, an effective inhibitor of the TGFβ pathway, was negatively correlated with stages of GC. Co-immunoprecipitation demonstrated that DCN binds with TGFβ, in normal gastric epithelium, whereas in GC, ASPN preferentially binds TGFβ. Possible activation of the canonical TGFβ pathway by phosphorylation of SMAD2 in tumor tissues suggests its role as an intracellular tumor promoter. Furthermore, tissues expressing ASPN showed unregulated EMT signalling. Our study uncovers ASPN as a GC-promoting gene and DCN as tumor suppressor, suggesting that ASPN can act as a prognostic marker in GC. For the first time, we describe the physical interaction of TGFβ with ASPN in GC and DCN with TGFβ in GC and normal gastric epithelium respectively. This study suggests that prevention of ASPN-TGFβ interaction or overexpression of DCN could serve as promising therapeutic strategies for GC patients."
https://openalex.org/W3189020001,"Sexual dysfunction is the commonest reproductive health problem observed among men with diabetes mellitus affecting their quality of life. Previous studies conducted in this area were concentrated on the specific domains of sexual dysfunction, and factors were not well-addressed. Therefore, this study was aimed to determine the prevalence of all forms of sexual dysfunction and to identify its associated factors among diabetic men patients attending at the three hospitals of the Amhara region, Ethiopia.An institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted involving 462 men diabetic patients at the three hospitals of the northwest Amhara region. A systemic random sampling technique was employed. A face-to-face interviewer-administered change in the sexual functioning questionnaire was used to collect the required data from the 20th of February to the 15th of April 2020. The binary logistic regression was employed and a multivariable logistic regressions model was used to control the effect of confounders. Variables that had an independent correlation with the sexual dysfunction were identified based on a p-value≤ 0.05. Likewise, the direction and strength of association were interpreted using Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) with its corresponding 95% CI.The prevalence of sexual dysfunction was found to be 69.5% (95%CI: (65.1-73.9)). The magnitude of sexual dysfunction was prevalently observed among participants who were older (> 50 years) (AOR = 8.7, 95%CI: (3.3-23.1)). Likewise, the odds of sexual dysfunction was significantly higher among men who have lived with diabetes for a longer duration (AOR = 10.8, 95%CI: (5.3-21.9)), with poor metabolic control (AOR = 3.57, 95%CI: (1.81-7.05)), with comorbid illnesses (AOR = 5.07, 95%CI: (2.16-11.9)), and diabetic-related complications (AOR = 3.01, 95%CI: 1.31-6.92). On the other hand, participants who were physically active (AOR = 0.41, 95%CI: (0.12-0.7)) and satisfied with their relationship (AOR = 0.15, 95%CI: (0.03-0.7)) showed a lesser risk of experiencing sexual dysfunction.Well over two-thirds of men with diabetes mellitus have experienced sexual dysfunction, implying a public health pressing problem. Older age, lack of physical activity, living longer duration with diabetes, having diabetic complications, experiencing co-morbid illnesses, being unsatisfied with couple relationship, and poor metabolic control increased the risk of developing SD. Therefore, promoting physical exercise, preventing co-morbid illnesses, and couples counseling to build up a good couple relationship are recommended to promote the sexual and reproductive health of men with diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W3190324604,"The most used methodologies for HPV genotyping in Tunisian studies are based on hybridization that are limited to a restricted number of HPV types and to a lack of specificity and sensitivity for same types. Recently, Next-Generation sequencing (NGS) technology has been efficiently used for HPV genotyping. In this work we designed and validated a sensitive genotyping method based on nested PCR followed by NGS. Eighty-six samples were tested for the validation of an HPV genotyping assay based on Nested-PCR followed by NGS. These include, 43 references plasmids and 43 positive HPV clinical cervical specimens previously evaluated with the conventional genotyping method: Reverse Line Hybridization (RLH). Results of genotyping using NGS were compared to those of RLH. The analytical sensitivity of the NGS assay was 1GE/μl per sample. The NGS allowed the detection of all HPV types presented in references plasmids. On the clinical samples, a total of 19 HPV types were detected versus 14 types using RLH. Besides the identification of more HPV types in multiple infection (6 types for NGS versus 4 for RLH), NGS allowed the identification of HPV types that were not detected by RLH. In addition, the NGS assay detected newly HPV types that were not described in Tunisia so far: HPV81, HPV43, HPV74, and HPV62. The high sensitivity and specificity of NGS for HPV genotyping in addition to the identification of new HPV types may justify the use of such technique to provide with high accuracy the profile of circulating types in epidemiological studies."
https://openalex.org/W3190725094,"Prosaposin (PSAP), a highly conserved glycoprotein, is a precursor of saposins A-D. Accumulating evidence suggests that PSAP is a neurotrophic factor, as well as a regulator of lysosomal enzymes. Recently, the orphan G-protein-coupled receptors GPR37 and GPR37L1 were recognized as PSAP receptors, but their functions have not yet been clarified. In this study, we examined the distribution of PSAP and its receptors in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) during development using specific antibodies, and showed that PSAP accumulates primarily in lysosomes and is dispersed throughout the cytoplasm of satellite cells. Later, PSAP colocalized with two receptors in satellite cells, and formed a characteristic ring shape approximately 8 weeks after birth, during a period of rapid DRG development. This ring shape, which was only observed around larger neurons, is evidence that several satellite cells are synchronously activated. We found that sortilin, a transporter of a wide variety of intracellular proteins containing PSAP, is strongly localized to the inner side of satellite cells, which contact the neuronal surface. These findings suggest that PSAP and GPR37/GPR37L1 play a role in activating both satellite and nerve cells."
https://openalex.org/W3188502207,"In order to realize roof control of shallow coal seam group mining in Western China, combining with engineering statistics, physical simulation and theoretical analysis, the roof weighting characteristics during lower coal seam mining were revealed, and the classification of shallow coal seam group was proposed. Based on this, mechanical models of roof structure were set up, and the calculation method of support resistance was determined. The results show that the roof weighting is closely related to the interburden thickness and the mining height of lower coal seam, considering the ratio of interburden thickness to the mining height, as well as the key stratum structure, the classification of shallow coal seam group was put forward. The first type is shallow coal seam group with no key stratum (SCSG-No), its roof pressure is mainly affected by caving roof of upper coal seam, and the interburden roof forms slanting pillar-beam structure. The second type is shallow coal seam group with single key stratum (SCSG-S), interburden roof represents step voussoir beam structure. The third type is shallow coal seam group with double key strata (SCSG-D), interburden roof can form double key strata structure, the lower key stratum forms slanting step voussoir beam structure, while the upper key stratum forms voussoir beam structure, besides, longwall face represents large—small periodic weighting. Through establishing the roof structure models, the calculation formulas of support resistance were determined, it can provide basis for roof control and promote safe mining in Western China."
https://openalex.org/W3113799241,"The high prevalence of morbidity and mortality from bacterial infections, together with the growing threat of antibacterial resistance, necessitated the development of alternative new drugs from traditional medicine. In Ethiopia, Impatiens tinctoria A. Rich has been traditionally used for the treatment of fungal infections such as ringworms that cause tinea pedis and it have also different medical values. Scientific information on its biological activity against a broad range of bacteria and safety data is scant, compared to its folklore data. In this study, we evaluated antibacterial activities and acute oral toxicity of aqueous, ethanol and ethyl acetate root extracts of Impatiens tinctoria A. Rich. Aqueous, ethanol and ethyl acetate extracts of the plant were evaluated using agar hole diffusion and agar dilution methods. Biological activities of the plant extracts were expressed as a zone of inhibition diameter, minimum inhibitory concentration (mg/ml), and minimum bactericidal concentration (mg/ml). The safety studies were performed by oral acute toxicity study according to the organization of economic cooperation and development test Guidelines 420.Gram-positive bacteria were more susceptible to the extracts compared to gram-negative bacteria, especially against S. aureus and S. epidermidis, which are commonly found in the skin. Ethyl acetate extract was more potent than ethanol and aqueous extracts. The 50% lethal dose (LD50) of tested mice was above 9600 mg/kg. This study provides a scientific basis for the antibacterial activity of the root extracts of I. tinctoria A. Rich, where, the ethyl acetate extract showed the most promising activity. Therefore, the antibacterial potential and practical non-toxicity of the study plant extracts suggested the possibility of using it for the development of antimicrobial drugs by further studying the plant in different directions."
https://openalex.org/W3126782602,"Many cephalopods such as octopus and squid change their skin color purposefully within a very short time. Furthermore, it is widely known that some octopuses have the ability to change the color and unevenness of the skin and to mimic the surroundings in short time. However, much research has not been done on the entire mimicry mechanism in which the octopus recognizes the surrounding landscape and changes the skin pattern. It seems that there is no hypothetical model to explain the whole mimicry mechanism yet. In this study, the mechanism of octopus skin pattern formation was assumed to be based on the Turing model. Here, the pattern formation by the Turing model was realized by the equivalent filter calculation model using the cellular automaton, instead of directly solving the differential equations. It was shown that this model can create various patterns with two feature parameters. Furthermore, for the eyes recognition part where two features are extracted from the Turing pattern image, our study proposed a method that can be calculated back with small amount of calculation using the characteristics of the cellular Turing pattern model. These two calculations can be expressed in the same mathematical frame based on the cellular automaton model using the convolution filter. As a result, it can be created a model which is capable of extracting features from patterns and reconstructing patterns in a short time, the model is considered to be a basic model for considering the mimicry mechanism of octopus. Also, in terms of application to machine learning, it is considered that it shows the possibility of leading to a model with a small amount of learning calculation."

The underlying mechanism of ET dysfunction remains poorly understood except for an apparent genesis such as a nasopharyngeal tumor or cleft palate. To better describe the ET, its functional anatomy, and the biomechanical valve mechanism and subsequent development of diagnostic and interventional tools, a three-dimensional model based on thin-layer histology was created from an ET in this study. Blackface sheep was chosen as a donor. The 3-D model was generated by the coherent alignment of the sections. It was then compared with the cone-beam computed tomography dataset of the complete embedded specimen taken before slicing. The model shows the topographic relation of the individual components, such as the bone and cartilage, the muscles and connective tissue, as well as the lining epithelium with the lumen. It indicates a limited spiraling rotation of the cartilaginous tube over its length and relevant positional relationships of the tensor and levator veli palatine muscles."
https://openalex.org/W3188739025,"Triple-negative breast cancer is the main type of breast carcinoma that causes mortality among women because of the limited treatment options and high recurrence. Chronic inflammation has been linked with the tumor microenvironment (TME) in breast cancer progression. Clinacanthus nutans (CN) has gained much attention because of its anticancer properties, but its mechanism remains unclear. We aimed to study the qualitative phytochemical content and elucidate the cytotoxicity effects of CN on human triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), MDA-MB-231 and human macrophage-like cells such as THP-1 by using sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay. As highly metastatic cells, MDA-MB-231 cells can migrate to the distal position, the effect of CN on migration were also elucidated using the scratch assay. The CN effects on ameliorating chronic inflammation in TME were studied following the co-culture of MDA-MB-231/THP-1 macrophages. The cytokine expression levels of IL-6, IL-1β and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) were determined using ELISA assays. The results showed that both ethanolic and aqueous CN extracts contained alkaloid, phenol and tannin, flavonoid, terpenoid, glycoside and steroid. However, saponin was only found in the aqueous extract of CN. CN was not cytotoxic to both MDA-MB-231 and THP-1 cells. The ability of MDA-MB-231 to migrate was also not halted by CN treatment. However, CN ethanol extract decreased IL-6 at 25 μg/mL (p = 0.02) and 100 μg/mL (p = 0.03) but CN aqueous extract increased IL-6 expression at 50 μg/mL (p = 0.08) and 100 μg/mL (p = 0.02). IL-1β showed decreased expression after treated with CN ethanol and CN aqueous both at 25 μg/mL (p = 0.03). TNF-α were significantly decreased after CN ethanol treatment at concentration 25- (p = 0.001), 50- (p = 0.000) and 100 μg/mL (p = 0.000). CN aqueous extract slightly inhibited TNF-α at all 25-50- and 100 μg/mL (p = 0.001, p = 0.000, p = 0.000, respectively). Overall, CN acts by ameliorating the pro-inflammatory condition in the TME and may be a potential strategy for its anticancer mechanism on highly metastatic breast cancer condition. The major pathways that link both cancer and inflammation were NF-κB and STATs thus further study on the upstream and downstream pathways is needed to fully understand the mechanism of CN extracts in cooling the inflamed TME in breast cancer."

However, it is unclear whether women who experience postpartum hemorrhage are at an increased risk of postpartum depression.To examine whether postpartum hemorrhage is associated with postpartum depression.We conducted a national register-based cohort study of 486,476 Swedish-born women who had a singleton livebirth between 2007 and 2014. We excluded women with pre-existing depression or who filled a prescription for an antidepressant before childbirth. We classified postpartum depression up to 12 months after giving birth by the presence of an International Classification of Diseases, version 10 (ICD-10) diagnosis code for depression or a filled outpatient prescription for an antidepressant. We used Cox proportional hazard models, adjusting for maternal sociodemographic and obstetric factors.Postpartum depression was identified in 2.0% (630/31,663) of women with postpartum hemorrhage and 1.9% (8601/455,059) of women without postpartum hemorrhage. In our unadjusted analysis, postpartum hemorrhage was not associated with postpartum depression (unadjusted hazard ratio (HR) = 1.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.97-1.15). After adjusting for maternal age, parity, education, cohabitation status, maternal smoking status, and early pregnancy maternal BMI, gestational age, and birthweight, the association did not appreciably change, with confidence intervals overlapping the null (adjusted HR = 1.08, 95% CI 0.99, 1.17).Within a population-based cohort of singleton women in Sweden with no prior history of depression, postpartum hemorrhage was not associated with postpartum depression."

With the public’s attention to the influence of haze, air quality will have a profound impact on the development of tourism in tourist destinations. Based on the Epsilon-based Measure (EBM) super-efficiency model and Global Malmquist–Luenberger index analysis method, this paper aims to study the tourism development efficiency of 58 major cities in China from 2001 to 2016 and analyse the total factor productivity in the development of urban tourism and the changing driving factors in consideration of the undesirable output of haze characterised by PM2.5 emission concentration. The study findings show that the overall efficiency of tourism development of 58 cities is not high in 2001–2016, but the tourism development efficiency of all cities is increasing year by year. Under the constraint of haze, the efficiency of urban tourism development is not directly proportional to the degree of urban development. The overall redundancy rate of each input index is slightly high, and the redundancy of PM2.5 emission concentration has a considerable effect on the efficiency of urban tourism development. The overall change trend in total factor productivity in the development of urban tourism is improved, mainly due to the improvement of technological progress factors. On this basis, the corresponding policy implications are concluded according to high-efficiency and high-quality development of tourism in 58 major cities."

This study estimated the operating efficiency and total factor productivity (TFP) of listed e-commerce firms in China from 2015 to 2019. Three related methodologies were applied: data envelopment analysis (DEA), the Malmquist TFP index, and stochastic frontier analysis. The DEA analysis results showed that environmental variables exerted a substantial effect on technical efficiency. Most firms demonstrated effective technical efficiency after adjustment for input variables. Business-to-business firms had the highest operating efficiency, followed by business-to-consumer and production-to-consumer firms. Technical progress and scale were identified as two major factors affecting improvement in TFP. Hence, e-commerce firms should make full use of advanced technology and aim to achieve economies of scale."

A total of 32 women were invited to take part in the interview, 15 of them accepted the invitation. However, saturation was reached before all interviews had been complete.Three themes emerged from the study: the women's experiences, challenges and the roles and contributions of significant others. The women were anxious, stressed-up, exhausted and financially burdened. Spouses and health professionals played significant roles by providing social, emotional and financial support for these women. Significant others such as spouses and close relatives were supportive and provided encouragement to the women.The experiences of women undergoing Assisted Reproductive Technologies are multi-dimensional. Thus, psychosocial interventions as part of ART services with health insurance cover may be client-centered and more appropriate for these group of women."

In a post-hoc, exploratory analysis of the randomised controlled CONTEXT trial, we investigated whether higher (i.e. less oxidised) plasma levels of free thiols as a biomarker of reduced oxidative stress are associated with a better initial graft function or a higher GFR.Free thiol levels were measured in plasma at baseline, 30 and 90 minutes after reperfusion of the kidney as well as at Day 1, Day 5 and twelve months after kidney transplantation in 217 patients from the CONTEXT study. Free thiol levels were compared to the kidney graft function measured as the estimated time to a 50% reduction in plasma creatinine (tCr50), the risk of DGF and measured GFR (mGFR) at Day 5 and twelve months after transplantation.Higher levels of free thiols at Day 1 and Day 5 are associated with higher mGFR at Day 5 (p<0.001, r2adj. = 0.16; p<0.001, r2adj. = 0.25), as well as with mGFR at twelve months (p<0.001, r2adj. = 0.20; p<0.001, r2adj. = 0.16). However, plasma levels of free thiols at 30 minutes and 90 minutes, but not Day 1, were significantly higher among patients experiencing DGF.Higher levels of plasma free thiols at Day 1 and Day 5, which are reflective of lower levels of oxidative stress, are associated with better early and late graft function in recipients of a kidney graft from deceased donors.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01395719."
https://openalex.org/W3187650671,"Automated specialty palliative care consultation (SPC) has been proposed as an intervention to improve patient-centered care in the intensive care unit (ICU). Existing automated SPC trigger criteria are designed to identify patients at highest risk of in-hospital death. We sought to evaluate common mortality-based SPC triggers and determine whether these triggers reflect actual use of SPC consultation. We additionally aimed to characterize the population of patients who receive SPC without meeting mortality-based triggers.We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all adult ICU admissions from 2012-2017 at an academic medical center with five subspecialty ICUs to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the five most common SPC triggers for predicting receipt of SPC. Among ICU admissions receiving SPC, we assessed differences in patients who met any SPC trigger compared to those who met none.Of 48,744 eligible admissions, 1,965 (4.03%) received SPC; 979 (49.82%) of consultations met at least 1 trigger. The sensitivity and specificity for any trigger predicting SPC was 49.82% and 79.61%, respectively. Patients who met no triggers but received SPC were younger (62.71 years vs 66.58 years, mean difference (MD) 3.87 years (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.44-5.30) p<0.001), had longer ICU length of stay (11.43 days vs 8.42 days, MD -3.01 days (95% CI -4.30 --1.72) p<0.001), and had a lower rate of in-hospital death (48.68% vs 58.12%, p<0.001).Mortality-based triggers for specialty palliative care poorly reflect actual use of SPC in the ICU.

However, there is limited data on this outcome in patients with hematologic malignancies. This study aimed to identify the clinical features of patients with malignant hematologic diseases diagnosed with Aeromonas sobria bacteremia and to evaluate whether the type of bacteremia, community-acquired bacteremia (CAB) or HAB, is associated with mortality.We retrospectively reviewed the clinical records of pediatric and adult patients between January 2000 and December 2017. Clinical characteristics were compared between CAB and HAB. Additionally, we stratified based on age group. Survival outcomes were assessed with Kaplan-Meier curves and a multivariate Cox regression analysis.A total of 37 patients (median age 24 years) were identified; 23 (62%) had HAB and 14 (38%) had CAB. Overall, the most common presenting symptom was abdominal pain (41%). Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 12/15, 80%) and acute myeloid leukemia (n = 8/22, 36%) were the primary hematologic malignancies in pediatric and adult patients, respectively. CAB patients had worse overall survival (OS) rates at 30 days in all (43% versus HAB 91%, p = 0.006) and adult patients (30% versus HAB 92%, p = 0.002). Cox regression analysis found that quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment and CAB were statistically significant factors associated with mortality. Low antimicrobial-resistant was noted, except for ciprofloxacin (n = 5/37, 14%).Our study found a worse OS among patients with hematologic malignancies and CAB by Aeromonas sobria. Our results suggest that patients with CAB present with a worse disease severity. These findings should aid clinicians to determine the survival prognosis in this population."
https://openalex.org/W3190406477,"Identifying the fundamental molecular factors that drive weight gain even in the absence of hypercaloric food intake, is crucial to enable development of novel treatments for the global pandemic of obesity. Here we investigated both adipose tissue-specific and systemic events that underlie the physiological weight gain occurring during early adulthood in mice fed a normocaloric diet. In addition, we used three different genetic models to identify molecular factors that promote physiological weight gain during normocaloric and hypercaloric diets. We demonstrated that normal physiological weight gain was accompanied by an increase in adipose tissue mass and the presence of cellular and metabolic signatures typically found during obesity, including adipocyte hypertrophy, macrophage recruitment into visceral fat and perturbed glucose metabolism. At the molecular level, this was associated with an increase in adipose tissue tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (Tph1) transcripts, the key enzyme responsible for the synthesis of peripheral serotonin. Genetic inactivation of Tph1 was sufficient to limit adipose tissue expansion and associated metabolic alterations. Mechanistically, we discovered that Tph1 inactivation resulted in down-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21Waf1/Cip1 expression. Single or double ablation of Tph1 and p21 were equally effective in preventing adipocyte expansion and systemic perturbation of glucose metabolism, upon both normocaloric and hypercaloric diets. Our results suggest that serotonin and p21 act as a central molecular determinant of weight gain and associated metabolic alterations, and highlights the potential of targeting these molecules as a pharmacologic approach to prevent the development of obesity."
https://openalex.org/W3192633798,"Extreme temperature exposure can reduce stored sperm viability within queen honey bees; however, little is known about how thermal stress may directly impact queen performance or other maternal quality metrics. Here, in a blind field trial, we recorded laying pattern, queen mass, and average callow worker mass before and after exposing queens to a cold temperature (4°C, 2 h), hot temperature (42°C, 2 h), and hive temperature (33°C, control). We measured sperm viability at experiment termination, and investigated potential vertical effects of maternal temperature stress on embryos using proteomics. We found that cold stress, but not heat stress, reduced stored sperm viability; however, we found no significant effect of temperature stress on any other recorded metrics (queen mass, average callow worker mass, laying patterns, the egg proteome, and queen spermathecal fluid proteome). Previously determined candidate heat and cold stress biomarkers were not differentially expressed in stressed queens, indicating that these markers only have short-term post-stress diagnostic utility. Combined with variable sperm viability responses to temperature stress reported in different studies, these data also suggest that there is substantial variation in temperature tolerance, with respect to impacts on fertility, amongst queens. Future research should aim to quantify the variation and heritability of temperature tolerance, particularly heat, in different populations of queens in an effort to promote queen resilience."
https://openalex.org/W3192901191,"Identifying coordinated activity within complex systems is essential to linking their structure and function. We study collective activity in networks of pulse-coupled oscillators that have variable network connectivity and integrate-and-fire dynamics. Starting from random initial conditions, we see the emergence of three broad classes of behaviors that differ in their collective spiking statistics. In the first class (""temporally-irregular""), all nodes have variable inter-spike intervals, and the resulting firing patterns are irregular. In the second (""temporally-regular""), the network generates a coherent, repeating pattern of activity in which all nodes fire with the same constant inter-spike interval. In the third (""chimeric""), subgroups of coherently-firing nodes coexist with temporally-irregular nodes. Chimera states have previously been observed in networks of oscillators; here, we find that the notions of temporally-regular and chimeric states encompass a much richer set of dynamical patterns than has yet been described. We also find that degree heterogeneity and connection density have a strong effect on the resulting state: in binomial random networks, high degree variance and intermediate connection density tend to produce temporally-irregular dynamics, while low degree variance and high connection density tend to produce temporally-regular dynamics. Chimera states arise with more frequency in networks with intermediate degree variance and either high or low connection densities. Finally, we demonstrate that a normalized compression distance, computed via the Lempel-Ziv complexity of nodal spike trains, can be used to distinguish these three classes of behavior even when the phase relationship between nodes is arbitrary."

Patients, materials and methods In recorded semi-structured telephone interviews, the patients answered questions about their quality of life, treatment procedures, their relationship with medical care staff and modern communication technologies. Each interview consisted of 28 questions. The average length of an interview was 30 minutes. The interviews were transcribed and analyzed by means of a qualitative content analysis according to Mayring. Results The COVID-19 pandemic adds to the burden of patients by decreasing their social contacts. They perceived the new isolation and protective measures in outpatient clinics as mostly positive and said its impact had been only slightly adverse. With the implemented safety measures, they feel adequately protected and looked after and want their antiproliferative therapy to be performed as scheduled. Talking to medical staff provides additional reassurance. Conclusion Although the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the social isolation of tumor patients, it has had only a minor effect on tumor therapy in the surveyed patient population. The benefits of modern communication options to tumor patients remains uncertain and should be investigated further in future studies."

Eight patients with jaw deformities who underwent maxillomandibular advancement and genioglossus advancement surgery were included in this study. Computed tomography scans and rhinomanometric readings were performed both preoperatively and postoperatively. Computational fluid dynamics models were created, and airflow simulations were performed using computational fluid dynamics software; the preferable number of computational mesh points was at least 10 million cells. The results for the right and left nares, including simulation and postoperative measurements, were qualitatively consistent, and surgery reduced airflow pressure loss. Geometry prediction simulation results were qualitatively consistent with the postoperative stereolithography data and postoperative simulation results. Simulations were performed with either the right or left naris blocked, and the predicted values were similar to those found clinically. In addition, geometry prediction simulation results were qualitatively consistent with the postoperative stereolithography data and postoperative simulation results. These findings suggest that geometry prediction simulation facilitates the preoperative prediction of the postoperative structural outcome."

Ethiopia conducted a Population-based HIV Impact Assessment (EPHIA) in urban areas between October 2017 and April 2018 to measure the status of the country’s response to the epidemic. Methods We conducted field data collection and HIV testing in randomly selected households using the national, rapid testing algorithm with laboratory confirmation of seropositive samples using a supplemental assay. In addition to self-report on HIV diagnosis and treatment, all HIV-positive participants were screened for a set of HIV antiretroviral (ARV) drugs indicative of the first- and second-line regimens. We calculated weighted frequencies and 95% confidence intervals to assess regional variation in participants’ level of unawareness of their HIV-positive status (adjusted for ARV status). Results We interviewed 20,170 survey participants 15–64 years of age, of which 19,136 (95%) were tested for HIV, 614 (3.2%) tested positive, and 119 (21%) of HIV-positive persons were unaware of their HIV status. Progress towards the UNAIDS first 90 target (90% of people living with HIV would be aware of their HIV status by 2020) substantially differed by administrative region of the country. In the bivariate analysis using log binomial regression, three regions (Oromia, Addis Ababa, and Harari), male gender, and young age (15–24 years) were significantly associated with awareness of HIV positive status. In multivariate analysis, the same variables were associated with awareness of HIV-positive status. Conclusion One-fifth of the HIV-positive urban population were unaware of their HIV-positive status. The number of unaware HIV-positive individuals has a different distribution than the HIV prevalence. National and regional planning and monitoring activities could address this potentially substantial source of undetected HIV infection by increasing HIV testing among young people, men and individuals who do not use condoms."
https://openalex.org/W3192212694,"This paper introduces an enhanced MSM (Mutual Subspace Method) methodology for gait recognition, to provide robustness to variations in walking speed. The enhanced MSM (eMSM) methodology expands and adapts the MSM, commonly used for face recognition, which is a static/physiological biometric, to gait recognition, which is a dynamic/behavioral biometrics. To address the loss of accuracy during calculation of the covariance matrix in the PCA step of MSM, we use a 2D PCA-based mutual subspace. Furhtermore, to enhance the discrimination capability, we rotate images over a number of angles, which enables us to extract richer gait features to then be fused by a boosting method. The eMSM methodology is evaluated on existing data sets which provide variable walking speed, i.e. CASIA-C and OU-ISIR gait databases, and it is shown to outperform state-of-the art methods. While the enhancement to MSM discussed in this paper uses combinations of 2D-PCA, rotation, boosting, other combinations of operations may also be advantageous."
https://openalex.org/W3192699048,"Body preferences are somewhat flexible and this variability may be the result of one’s visual diet (whereby mere exposure to certain bodies shifts preferences), associative learning mechanisms (whereby cues to health and status within the population are internalised and affect body preferences), or a mixture of both visual diet and associative learning effects. We tested how these factors may drive changes in preferences for muscularity in male bodies across a male and female sample. Three studies were conducted where participants viewed manipulation images of high and/or low muscle mass males which were either aspirational (high status clothing and posture) and/or neutral (no obvious cues to status). Preferences for muscularity were recorded before and after exposure to such manipulation images to assess whether body preferences had changed following manipulation. We found evidence for both the visual diet and associative learning hypotheses. Exposure to non-muscular male bodies decreased preferences for muscular bodies irrespective of image valence. Exposure to aspirational non-muscular male bodies alongside neutral muscular male bodies also led to a decrease in muscularity preferences. Further, when manipulation conditions are less obviously skewed towards a particular body type, preferences still shifted in the direction of the most prevalent body type, suggesting that demand characteristics are unlikely to have confounded results of previous adaptation experiments with more obvious manipulations."
https://openalex.org/W3187378794,"Many insect species are associated with bacterial partners that can significantly influence their evolutionary ecology. Compared to other insect groups, aphids harbor a bacterial microbiota that has the reputation of being poorly diversified, generally limited to the presence of the obligate nutritional symbiont Buchnera aphidicola and some facultative symbionts. In this study, we analyzed the bacterial diversity associated with the dogwood-grass aphid Anoecia corni, an aphid species that spends much of its life cycle in a subterranean environment. Little is known about the bacterial diversity associated with aphids displaying such a lifestyle, and one hypothesis is that close contact with the vast microbial community of the rhizosphere could promote the acquisition of a richer bacterial diversity compared to other aphid species. Using 16S rRNA amplicon Illumina sequencing on specimens collected on wheat roots in Morocco, we identified 10 bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) corresponding to five bacterial genera. In addition to the obligate symbiont Buchnera, we identified the facultative symbionts Serratia symbiotica and Wolbachia in certain aphid colonies. The detection of Wolbachia is unexpected as it is considered rare in aphids. Moreover, its biological significance remains unknown in these insects. Besides, we also detected Arsenophonus and Dactylopiibacterium carminicum. These results suggest that, despite its subterranean lifestyle, A. corni shelter a bacterial diversity mainly limited to bacterial endosymbionts."
