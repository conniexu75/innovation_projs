https://openalex.org/W3043662404,"As countries in the world review interventions for containing the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), important lessons can be drawn from the study of the full transmission dynamics of its causative agent—severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)— in Wuhan (China), where vigorous non-pharmaceutical interventions have suppressed the local outbreak of this disease1. Here we use a modelling approach to reconstruct the full-spectrum dynamics of COVID-19 in Wuhan between 1 January and 8 March 2020 across 5 periods defined by events and interventions, on the basis of 32,583 laboratory-confirmed cases1. Accounting for presymptomatic infectiousness2, time-varying ascertainment rates, transmission rates and population movements3, we identify two key features of the outbreak: high covertness and high transmissibility. We estimate 87% (lower bound, 53%) of the infections before 8 March 2020 were unascertained (potentially including asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic individuals); and a basic reproduction number (R0) of 3.54 (95% credible interval 3.40–3.67) in the early outbreak, much higher than that of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)4,5. We observe that multipronged interventions had considerable positive effects on controlling the outbreak, decreasing the reproduction number to 0.28 (95% credible interval 0.23–0.33) and—by projection—reducing the total infections in Wuhan by 96.0% as of 8 March 2020. We also explore the probability of resurgence following the lifting of all interventions after 14 consecutive days of no ascertained infections; we estimate this probability at 0.32 and 0.06 on the basis of models with 87% and 53% unascertained cases, respectively—highlighting the risk posed by substantial covert infections when changing control measures. These results have important implications when considering strategies of continuing surveillance and interventions to eventually contain outbreaks of COVID-19. Analysis of the full-spectrum transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in Wuhan reveals that multipronged non-pharmaceutical interventions were effective in controlling the outbreak, and highlights that covert infections may pose risks of resurgence when reopening without intervention measures."

CRISPR arrays in the bacterial genome, derived from the genome of invading viruses, are used to generate a CRISPR RNA that guides the Cas enzyme to destroy repeat viral invaders. Recently, an unexpectedly compact CRISPR-Cas system was identified in huge bacteriophages. Pausch et al . show that even though this system lacks commonly found accessory proteins, it is functional. In addition to a CRISPR array, the only component of the system is an enzyme called CasF, which uses the same active site to process transcripts of the CRISPR arrays into CRISPR RNA and to destroy foreign nucleic acids. This system, which is active in human and plant cells, provides a hypercompact addition to the genome-editing toolbox. Science this issue p. 333"
https://openalex.org/W3043746245,"In late December 2019, a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology were reported linked to a market in Wuhan, China1. The causative agent was identified as the species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus and was named SARS-CoV-2 (ref. 2). By 16 April the virus had spread to 185 different countries, infected over 2,000,000 people and resulted in over 130,000 deaths3. In the Netherlands, the first case of SARS-CoV-2 was notified on 27 February. The outbreak started with several different introductory events from Italy, Austria, Germany and France followed by local amplification in, and later also outside, the south of the Netherlands. The combination of near to real-time whole-genome sequence analysis and epidemiology resulted in reliable assessments of the extent of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the community, facilitating early decision-making to control local transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the Netherlands. We demonstrate how these data were generated and analyzed, and how SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome sequencing, in combination with epidemiological data, was used to inform public health decision-making in the Netherlands. The combination of near to real-time whole-genome sequence analysis and epidemiology resulted in reliable assessments of the extent of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the community, facilitating early decision-making to control local transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the Netherlands."

https://openalex.org/W3043037931,"Although Huntington’s disease is a late-manifesting neurodegenerative disorder, both mouse studies and neuroimaging studies of presymptomatic mutation carriers suggest that Huntington’s disease might affect neurodevelopment. To determine whether this is actually the case, we examined tissue from human fetuses (13 weeks gestation) that carried the Huntington’s disease mutation. These tissues showed clear abnormalities in the developing cortex, including mislocalization of mutant huntingtin and junctional complex proteins, defects in neuroprogenitor cell polarity and differentiation, abnormal ciliogenesis, and changes in mitosis and cell cycle progression. We observed the same phenomena in Huntington’s disease mouse embryos, where we linked these abnormalities to defects in interkinetic nuclear migration of progenitor cells. Huntington’s disease thus has a neurodevelopmental component and is not solely a degenerative disease."

https://openalex.org/W3042639640,"Liquid-liquid critical point of water Despite a broad range of experimental observations that indirectly point out the possible existence of a liquid-liquid phase transition in deeply supercooled water, no unambiguous experiment has shown this yet. The challenges of performing experiments under such conditions are associated with the inevitable rapid crystallization of the metastable liquid state, and therefore computational simulations become a crucial alternative. Using two accurate classical models of water and long (more than 40 microseconds) isobaricisothermal molecular dynamics simulations, Debenedetti et al. provide strong computational evidence of the presence of a second metastable liquid-liquid critical point in the deeply supercooled region that has critical behavior consistent with the three-dimensional Ising universality class.

https://openalex.org/W3043448229,Conservation help from genomics Corals worldwide are under threat from rising sea temperatures and pollution. One response to heat stress is coral bleaching—the loss of photosynthetic endosymbionts that provide energy for the coral. Fuller et al. present a high-resolution genome of the coral Acropora millepora (see the Perspective by Bay and Guerrero). They were able to perform population genetic analyses with samples sequenced at lower coverage and conduct genome-wide association studies. These data were combined to generate a polygenic risk score for bleaching that can be used in coral conservation. Science this issue p. eaba4674 ; see also p. 249
https://openalex.org/W3043703035,"Deconstructing a perilous loop Cancer cells that give rise to solid tumors reside in a specialized microenvironment containing growth factors that support tumor growth and progression. The mechanisms by which tumor cells within this so-called “niche” attract and sustain these growth factors are poorly understood. Studying a mouse model of squamous cell carcinoma, Taniguchi et al. identified a signaling loop initiated by certain tumor cells within the niche that become more invasive on exposure to transforming growth factor β (TGF-β). They show that the tumor cells release the cytokine interleukin-33, which induces the differentiation of nearby myeloid cells into macrophages. These macrophages in turn release TGF-β, which feeds back to the tumor cells, promoting their malignant progression. Science this issue p. eaay1813"
https://openalex.org/W3043398874,"Ironing out a survival strategy Metastatic cells display a notable ability to adapt to—and even thrive in—harsh microenvironments. One extreme example is leptomeningeal metastases (LM), cancer cells that enter a region of the central nervous system called the subarachnoid space, which is filled with cerebral spinal fluid (CSF). This anatomic site has a limited supply of micronutrients such as iron, and it harbors immune cells. Chi et al. used single-cell RNA sequencing to study CSF samples from cancer patients with LM (see the Perspective by Garzia and Taylor). They found that LM cells express and use components of a high-affinity iron-capturing system. Through this mechanism, the LM cells avoid the adverse effects of iron deprivation and potentially escape immune attack by limiting the supply of iron to macrophages.

Membranes might offer an alternative approach, but few can survive immersion in organic solvents nor are they able to extract relatively small molecules. Thompson et al. developed a series of polymers of intrinsic microporosity that they used for membrane-based separations of organic compounds in an organic solvent (see the Perspective by Brennecke and Freeman). The new membrane has a molecular weight cutoff of 253 daltons, far lower than existing ones closer to 600 daltons. The polymers were used to separate light shale crude oil and succeeded in fractionation of molecular weights of about 170 daltons. Science this issue p. 310 ; see also p. 254"
https://openalex.org/W3042915063,"Isomerization-based strategies to enable the stereodivergent construction of complex polyenes from geometrically defined alkene linchpins remain conspicuously underdeveloped. Mitigating the thermodynamic constraints inherent to isomerization is further frustrated by the considerations of atom efficiency in idealized low-molecular weight precursors. In this work, we report a general ambiphilic C3 scaffold that can be isomerized and bidirectionally extended. Predicated on highly efficient triplet energy transfer, the selective isomerization of β-borylacrylates is contingent on the participation of the boron p orbital in the substrate chromophore. Rotation of the C(sp2)-B bond by 90° in the product renders re-excitation inefficient and endows directionality. This subtle stereoelectronic gating mechanism enables the stereocontrolled syntheses of well-defined retinoic acid derivatives."
https://openalex.org/W3043674834,"In mammals, the acquisition of the germline from the soma provides the germline with an essential challenge: the need to erase and reset genomic methylation1. In the male germline, RNA-directed DNA methylation silences young, active transposable elements2–4. The PIWI protein MIWI2 (PIWIL4) and its associated PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) instruct DNA methylation of transposable elements3,5. piRNAs are proposed to tether MIWI2 to nascent transposable element transcripts; however, the mechanism by which MIWI2 directs the de novo methylation of transposable elements is poorly understood, although central to the immortality of the germline. Here we define the interactome of MIWI2 in mouse fetal gonocytes undergoing de novo genome methylation and identify a previously unknown MIWI2-associated factor, SPOCD1, that is essential for the methylation and silencing of young transposable elements. The loss of Spocd1 in mice results in male-specific infertility but does not affect either piRNA biogenesis or the localization of MIWI2 to the nucleus. SPOCD1 is a nuclear protein whose expression is restricted to the period of de novo genome methylation. It co-purifies in vivo with DNMT3L and DNMT3A, components of the de novo methylation machinery, as well as with constituents of the NURD and BAF chromatin remodelling complexes. We propose a model whereby tethering of MIWI2 to a nascent transposable element transcript recruits repressive chromatin remodelling activities and the de novo methylation apparatus through SPOCD1. In summary, we have identified a previously unrecognized and essential executor of mammalian piRNA-directed DNA methylation. Newly identified protein SPOCD1 is crucial in de novo DNA methylation directed by PIWI proteins and piRNAs, helping to control DNA silencing in mouse male germline."
https://openalex.org/W3043174733,"Through mechanisms that remain poorly defined, defects in nucleocytoplasmic transport and accumulations of specific nuclear-pore-complex-associated proteins have been reported in multiple neurodegenerative diseases, including C9orf72 Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Frontotemporal Dementia (ALS/FTD). Using super-resolution structured illumination microscopy, we have explored the mechanism by which nucleoporins are altered in nuclei isolated from C9orf72 induced pluripotent stem-cell-derived neurons (iPSNs). Of the 23 nucleoporins evaluated, we observed a reduction in a subset of 8, including key components of the nuclear pore complex scaffold and the transmembrane nucleoporin POM121. Reduction in POM121 appears to initiate a decrease in the expression of seven additional nucleoporins, ultimately affecting the localization of Ran GTPase and subsequent cellular toxicity in C9orf72 iPSNs. Collectively, our data suggest that the expression of expanded C9orf72 ALS/FTD repeat RNA alone affects nuclear POM121 expression in the initiation of a pathological cascade affecting nucleoporin levels within neuronal nuclei and ultimately downstream neuronal survival."
https://openalex.org/W3043302462,"Programmed aging in yeast cells Following the fate of individual yeast cells has revealed aging to be more of a programmable decision process rather than a simple accumulation of deleterious events. Li et al. combined single-cell studies and mathematical modeling to show that yeast cells showed two different forms of aging: one with less ribosomal DNA silencing, in which nucleoli were degraded, and another with less heme accumulation and hemedependent transcription, in which mitochondria were more affected. Overexpression of the lysine deacetylase Sir2, which contributes to ribosomal DNA silencing, led to a third cell-aging fate in which the average life span was extended. If other cells age in similar ways, then this study may provide new ways to consider dynamics of aging and strategies to extend the health span. Science this issue p. 325"
https://openalex.org/W3043507423,"High-performance piezoelectric materials are critical components for electromechanical sensors and actuators. For more than 60 years, the main strategy for obtaining large piezoelectric response has been to construct multiphase boundaries, where nanoscale domains with local structural and polar heterogeneity are formed, by tuning complex chemical compositions. We used a different strategy to emulate such local heterogeneity by forming nanopillar regions in perovskite oxide thin films. We obtained a giant effective piezoelectric coefficient [Formula: see text] of ~1098 picometers per volt with a high Curie temperature of ~450°C. Our lead-free composition of sodium-deficient sodium niobate contains only three elements (Na, Nb, and O). The formation of local heterogeneity with nanopillars in the perovskite structure could be the basis for a general approach to designing and optimizing various functional materials."
https://openalex.org/W3043726119,"Bone is one of the most common sites of metastasis from advanced solid tumors. Bone metastasis is a leading cause of pain and increases the risk of skeletal-related events (SREs) in cancer patients. In addition to affecting the quality of life, it also increases the medical costs and mortality risk. We aimed to examine the occurrence of bone metastasis and SREs in Korean cancer patients using a nationwide health database. Using claims data from the National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort (2002-2013), we extracted the data of bone metastasis patients diagnosed with any of the seven major cancers in Korea from January 2002 to December 2010. Selected SREs included pathologic fracture, spinal cord compression, radiation therapy, and palliative bone surgery. We used time-to-event analysis to estimate patient survival after bone metastasis. A total of 21,562 newly diagnosed cancer patients were identified; bone metastases developed in 1,849 patients (breast cancer, 18.8%; prostate cancer, 17.5%; lung cancer, 13.7%). The median time from primary cancer diagnosis to bone metastasis was 18.9 months. The cumulative incidence of SREs was 45.1% in all bone metastasis patients. The most common cancer type was lung cancer (53.4%), followed by liver (50.9%), prostate (45.9%), breast (43.6%), and colorectal (40.2%) cancers. Almost all SREs developed 1 month after bone metastasis, except in patients with breast and prostate cancers (median: 5.9 months in breast cancer and 4.7 months in prostate cancer). Survival duration after the development of bone metastasis was < 6 months in stomach, liver, colorectal, and lung cancer patients. Breast and prostate cancer patients survived for > 1 year after the occurrence of SREs. This study reveals the epidemiology of bone metastasis and SREs in Korean cancer patients, and the findings can be used to assess the actual bone health status of cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W3042271358,"Antimicrobial-resistant and novel pathogens continue to emerge, outpacing efforts to contain and treat them. Therefore, there is a crucial need for safe and effective therapies. Ultraviolet-A (UVA) phototherapy is FDA-approved for several dermatological diseases but not for internal applications. We investigated UVA effects on human cells in vitro, mouse colonic tissue in vivo, and UVA efficacy against bacteria, yeast, coxsackievirus group B and coronavirus-229E. Several pathogens and virally transfected human cells were exposed to a series of specific UVA exposure regimens. HeLa, alveolar and primary human tracheal epithelial cell viability was assessed after UVA exposure, and 8-Oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine was measured as an oxidative DNA damage marker. Furthermore, wild-type mice were exposed to intracolonic UVA as an in vivo model to assess safety of internal UVA exposure. Controlled UVA exposure yielded significant reductions in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Clostridioides difficile, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Proteus mirabilis and Candida albicans. UVA-treated coxsackievirus-transfected HeLa cells exhibited significantly increased cell survival compared to controls. UVA-treated coronavirus-229E-transfected tracheal cells exhibited significant coronavirus spike protein reduction, increased mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein and decreased coronavirus-229E-induced cell death. Specific controlled UVA exposure had no significant effect on growth or 8-Oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine levels in three types of human cells. Single or repeated in vivo intraluminal UVA exposure produced no discernible endoscopic, histologic or dysplastic changes in mice. These findings suggest that, under specific conditions, UVA reduces various pathogens including coronavirus-229E, and may provide a safe and effective treatment for infectious diseases of internal viscera. Clinical studies are warranted to further elucidate the safety and efficacy of UVA in humans."
https://openalex.org/W3042537701,"Summary Primed and naive human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) do not fully recapitulate the X chromosome status observed in human preimplantation epiblast and fail to initiate random X chromosome inactivation (XCI) upon differentiation. Therefore, an ideal system for studying XCI during early human development is yet to be established. We show that incomplete blocking of autocrine fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) signaling in naive hESCs drives significant heterogeneity in X chromosome and pluripotency status. We derived homozygous XaXa naive hESCs with dual allelic XIST expression and high levels of TFCP2L1, whose transcriptome and X chromosome states are similar to human preimplantation epiblast. Random XCI was initiated upon naive-to-primed conversion of these cells, and both pre- and post-XCI primed hESCs were obtained. We observed random XCI in all cells upon further differentiation of pre-XCI primed hESCs. Together, these findings enable derivation of homogeneous naive hESCs and establish a powerful platform to study human XCI."

To identify risk-groups with insufficient PA and to guide interventions, continuous and representative tracking of PA is crucial. In this paper, representative PA data of children and adolescents from the Motorik-Modul (MoMo) baseline study (2003–2006, N = 4,528) is compared to those of Wave 2 (2014–2017, N = 3,708). Participants aged 4–17 were drawn out of 167 sample points in Germany and the data was weighted to ensure representativeness for Germany. Organized (sports clubs and schools) and unorganized (unorganized sports and playing outside) PA was measured by questionnaire and stratified by sex, age, and socioeconomic status. Contrary to common expectation, overall PA remained stable among youths in the past ten years, however, there is an ongoing trend towards organized forms of PA at the expense of unorganized sports and playing outside. Besides different trends in settings, there is inequality in PA distribution among socioeconomic status and gender, unequally pronounced in different settings."
https://openalex.org/W3043233600,"Providing runners with footwear that match their functional needs has the potential to improve footwear comfort, enhance running performance and reduce the risk of overuse injuries. It is currently not known how footwear experts make decisions about different shoe features and their properties for runners of different levels. We performed a Delphi study in order to understand: 1) definitions of different runner levels, 2) which footwear features are considered important and 3) how these features should be prescribed for runners of different levels. Experienced academics, journalists, coaches, bloggers and physicians that examine the effects of footwear on running were recruited to participate in three rounds of a Delphi study. Three runner level definitions were refined throughout this study based on expert feedback. Experts were also provided a list of 20 different footwear features. They were asked which features were important and what the properties of those features should be. Twenty-four experts, most with 10+ years of experience, completed all three rounds of this study. These experts came to a consensus for the characteristics of three different running levels. They indicated that 12 of the 20 footwear features initially proposed were important for footwear design. Of these 12 features, experts came to a consensus on how to apply five footwear feature properties for all three different running levels. These features were: upper breathability, forefoot bending stiffness, heel-to-toe drop, torsional bending stiffness and crash pad. Interestingly, the experts were not able to come to a consensus on one of the most researched footwear features, rearfoot midsole hardness. These recommendations can provide a starting point for further biomechanical studies, especially for features that are considered as important, but have not yet been examined experimentally."
https://openalex.org/W3043395293,"Restricted V(D)J recombination during fetal development was postulated to limit antibody repertoire breadth and prevent autoimmunity. However, newborn serum contains abundant autoantibodies, suggesting that B cell tolerance during gestation is not yet fully established. To investigate this apparent paradox, we evaluated the reactivities of more than 450 antibodies cloned from single B cells from human fetal liver, bone marrow, and spleen. We found that incomplete B cell tolerance in early human fetal life favored the accumulation of polyreactive B cells that bound both apoptotic cells and commensal bacteria from healthy adults. Thus, the restricted fetal preimmune repertoire contains potentially beneficial self-reactive innate-like B cell specificities that may facilitate the removal of apoptotic cells during development and shape gut microbiota assembly after birth."
https://openalex.org/W3042780866,"DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) is the most commonly mutated gene in clonal hematopoiesis (CH). Somatic DNMT3A mutations arise in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) many years before malignancies develop, but difficulties in comparing their impact before malignancy with wild-type cells have limited the understanding of their contributions to transformation. To circumvent this limitation, we derived normal and DNMT3A mutant lymphoblastoid cell lines from a germline mosaic individual in whom these cells co-existed for nearly 6 decades. Mutant cells dominated the blood system, but not other tissues. Deep sequencing revealed similar mutational burdens and signatures in normal and mutant clones, while epigenetic profiling uncovered the focal erosion of DNA methylation at oncogenic regulatory regions in mutant clones. These regions overlapped with those sensitive to DNMT3A loss after DNMT3A ablation in HSCs and in leukemia samples. These results suggest that DNMT3A maintains a conserved DNA methylation pattern, the erosion of which provides a distinct competitive advantage to hematopoietic cells."
https://openalex.org/W3042221319,"Paclitaxel is an effective natural-source chemotherapeutic agent commonly applied to treat a vast range of cancers. In vitro Corylus avellana culture has been reported as a promising and inexpensive system for paclitaxel production. Fungal elicitors have been made known as the most efficient strategy for the biosynthesis induction of secondary metabolites in plant in vitro culture. In this research, C. avellana cell suspension culture (CSC) was exposed to cell extract (CE) and culture filtrate (CF) derived from Camarosporomyces flavigenus, either individually or combined treatment, in mid and late log phase. There is no report on the use of whole fungal elicitors (the combined treatment of CE and CF) for the elicitation of secondary metabolite biosynthesis in plant in vitro culture. The combined treatment of CE and CF significantly led to more paclitaxel biosynthesis and secretion than the individual use of them. Also, multivariate statistical approaches including stepwise regression (SR), ordinary least squares regression (OLSR), principal component regression (PCR) and partial least squares regression (PLSR) were used to model and predict paclitaxel biosynthesis and secretion. Based on value account for (VAF), root mean square error (RMSE), coefficient of determination (R2), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and relative percent difference (RPD) can be concluded that mentioned regression models effectively worked only for modeling and predicting extracellular paclitaxel portion in C. avellana cell culture."

TMPRSS11A is a TTSP expressed on the surface of airway epithelial cells, which has been shown to cleave and activate spike proteins of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (CoVs). In this study, we examined the mechanism underlying the activation cleavage of TMPRSS11A that converts the one-chain zymogen to a two-chain enzyme. By expression in human embryonic kidney 293, esophageal EC9706, and lung epithelial A549 and 16HBE cells, Western blotting, and site-directed mutagenesis, we found that the activation cleavage of human TMPRSS11A was mediated by autocatalysis.

We also showed that TMPRSS11A was able to cleave the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.

TTSPs are synthesized in a precursor or zymogen form with little catalytic activity. Proteolytic cleavage at a conserved activation site converts the zymogen to an active enzyme. To date, how CoV-activating TTSPs are activated in cells is not well understood. In this study, we analyzed the activation cleavage of TMPRSS11A, which is expressed in airway epithelial cells (28Zmora P. Hoffmann M. Kollmus H. Moldenhauer A.S. Danov O. Braun A. Winkler M.

By immunostaining, flow cytometry, Western blotting, protease digestion, and site-directed mutagenesis, we show that TMPRSS11A is autoactivated inside the cell before reaching the cell surface. This mechanism of intracellular activation cleavage differs from the extracellular activation cleavage reported in other TTSPs. Moreover, we found that TMPRSS11A exhibited the activity in cleaving the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Human TMPRSS11A consists of 418 amino acids. Fig. 1A shows the domain structure of TMPRSS11A, including an N-terminal cytoplasmic tail, a transmembrane domain (TM), and an extracellular region containing a SEA (sea urchin sperm protein/enteropeptidase/agrin) domain and a C-terminal serine protease domain. The conserved activation cleavage site is at Arg186–Ile187 (Fig. 1A and Fig. S1). There is a disulfide bond (Cys175–Cys292) linking the protease domain to the propepide region after the cleavage at the Arg186–Ile187 (Fig. 1A). To study TMPRSS11A, we expressed human TMPRSS11A with a C-terminal V5 tag in transfected human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells. In flow cytometry, we found TMPRSS11A on the cell surface (Fig. 1B). In immunostaining, we detected TMPRSS11A on the surface of nonpermeabilized cells (Fig. 1C). The immunofluorescent signal was stronger when the cells were permeabilized, which allows staining both the cell surface and intracellular TMPRSS11A protein (Fig. 1C). These results are consistent with the predicted membrane topology of TMPRSS11A being a TTSP. In Western blotting of lysates from the transfected HEK293 cells, we detected a single ∼57-kDa band under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 1D, left panel). When Western blotting was done under reducing conditions, three bands of ∼57, ∼37, and ∼28 kDa, respectively, were detected (Fig. 1D, right panel). In Western blotting with cell surface-labeled proteins, a single band (∼57 kDa) and two bands (∼57 and ∼37 kDa) were detected under nonreducing and reducing conditions, respectively (Fig. 1E). Based on the calculated molecular mass, the ∼57-kDa band represents the one-chain TMPRSS11A zymogen, whereas the ∼37-kDa band represents the protease domain fragment cleaved at the conserved activation site (Fig. 1A). Because the V5 tag was at the C terminus, the cleaved N-terminal fragment was not detected by the anti-V5 antibody in Western blotting. These results indicate that TMPRSS11A is activated and present on the surface of the transfected HEK293 cells. The identity of the ∼28-kDa band detected in Western blotting (Fig. 1D, right panel) was unclear. This band was observed under reducing conditions in cell lysates, but not among cell surface-labeled proteins (Fig. 1E, right panel), indicating that this fragment remained inside the cells. Human TMPRSS11A contains two N-glycosylation sites: one at Asn153 in the SEA domain and the other at Asn303 in the protease domain (Fig. 2A). To exclude the possibility that the ∼28-kDa band was an unglycosylated fragment, we treated HEK293 cell lysates with PNGase F to remove N-glycans on proteins. In Western blotting under reducing conditions, the ∼57-, ∼37-, and ∼28-kDa TMPRSS11A bands all migrated faster compared with those in untreated samples (Fig. 2B), indicating that the ∼28-kDa band may be a proteolytically cleaved fragment but not an unglycosylated fragment. Based on the calculated molecular mass, the ∼28-kDa band could be generated from a cleavage at Arg265 in the protease domain (Fig. 2C). To test this hypothesis, we made a plasmid expressing the mutant R265A, in which Arg265 in TMPRSS11A was replaced by Ala. In Western blotting with lysates from transfected HEK293 cells, the ∼28-kDa band was detected in TMPRSS11A WT but not the mutant R265A (Fig. 2D), indicating that the ∼28-kDa band is created by proteolytic cleavage at Arg265 in the protease domain. In a recent study in transfected 293T cells, more than seven major TMPRRSS11A fragments were detected by Western blotting (28Zmora P. Hoffmann M. Kollmus H. Moldenhauer A.S. Danov O. Braun A. Winkler M. Schughart K. Pöhlmann S. TMPRSS11A activates the influenza A virus hemagglutinin and the MERS coronavirus spike protein and is insensitive against blockade by HAI-1.J. Biol.

It is difficult to know if those fragments were derived by TMPRSS11A autocatalysis or unknown protease(s) or both in 293T cells. To circumvent this problem, we made plasmids expressing mutants R186A and S368A, in which the activation cleavage site at Arg186 and the catalytic Ser368 were mutated to Ala, respectively (Fig. 3A). In Western blotting of lysates from HEK293 cells expressing the R186A mutant, only the ∼57-kDa zymogen band was detected (Fig. 3B), indicating that the ∼37-kDa band was derived from cleavage at the conserved activation site Arg186 and that the single-chain TMPRSS11A was incapable of cleaving at Arg265. Similarly, Western blotting of lysates from HEK293 cells expressing the S368A mutant showed the ∼57-kDa band only (Fig. 3B), indicating that cleavages at Arg186 (generating the ∼37-kDa band) and Arg265 (generating the ∼28-kDa band) depended on the catalytic activity of TMPRSS11A. TMPRSS11A, also called ECRG1 (esophageal cancer-related gene 1), was first identified in human esophageal cancers (31Li Y. Zhang X. Huang G. Miao X. Guo L. Lin D. Lu S.H. Identification of a novel polymorphism Arg290Gln of esophageal cancer related gene 1 (ECRG1) and its related risk to esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.Carcinogenesis. 2006; 27: 798-80210.1093/carcin/bgi258Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 32Zhao N.

(Maywood). 2006; 231: 84-9010.1177/153537020623100110Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). To verify our results, we expressed TMPRSS11A WT and mutants R186A and S368A in EC9706 cells, a human esophageal cancer cell line (33Wang H.T. Kong J.P. Ding F. Wang X.Q. Wang M.R. Liu L.X. Wu M. Liu Z.H. Analysis of gene expression profile induced by EMP-1 in esophageal cancer cells using cDNA microarray.World J. Gastroenterol. 2003; 9 (12632483): 392-39810.3748/wjg.v9.i3.392Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In Western blotting of lysates from transfected EC9706 cells, we detected three bands of ∼57, ∼37, and ∼28 kDa, respectively, in TMPRSS11A WT, but a single ∼57-kDa band in mutants R186A and S386A (Fig. 3C). Similar results were observed in additional experiments with human bronchial (16HBE) and alveolar basal (A549) epithelial cells (Fig. S2). These results are consistent, indicating that TMPRSS11A undergoes autoactivation at Arg186 and subsequent autocleavage at Arg265 in the protease domain. To understand if the detected TMPRSS11A autoactivation cleavage occurred intracellularly or on the cell surface, we expressed TMPRSS11A WT in HEK293 cells and treated the cells with trypsin to remove surface proteins. In flow cytometry, TMPRSS11A was detected on the surface of the transfected HEK293 cells (Fig. 4A). The expression was reduced to the background level in the cells treated with trypsin (Fig. 4A). When the cells were lysed and lysates were analyzed by Western blotting, we observed the ∼57-, ∼37-, and ∼28-kDa bands in the cells without or with trypsin treatment (Fig. 4B). These results indicate that TMPRSS11A activation cleavage occurred intracellularly. We next treated HEK293 cells expressing TMPRSS11A with brefeldin A (BFA) and monensin, which inhibit protein trafficking in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi (34Dinter A. Berger E.G. Golgi-disturbing agents.Histochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 109 (9681636): 571-59010.1007/s004180050256Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). In Western blotting, we found the ∼57-, ∼37-, and ∼28-kDa bands in TMPRSS11A-expressing cells without or with BFA or monensin treatment (Fig. 4C). In these studies, we did parallel control experiments with corin (Fig. S3), a TTSP known to be activated on the cell surface but not intracellularly (6Chen S. Cao P. Dong N. Peng J. Zhang C. Wang H. Zhou T. Yang J. Zhang Y. Martelli E.E. Naga Prasad S.V. Miller R.E. Malfait A.M. Zhou Y. Wu Q. PCSK6-mediated corin activation is essential for normal blood pressure.Nat. Med. 2015; 21 (26259032): 1048-105310.1038/nm.3920Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In Western blotting, the ∼40-kDa corin protease domain fragment from activation cleavage was detected in the cells without, but not with, trypsin, BFA, or monensin treatment (Fig. 4D). These results indicate that, unlike corin, TMPRSS11A is activated intracellularly before reaching the cell surface. To examine if the transmembrane domain in TMPRSS11A is required for activation cleavage, we made a plasmid expressing a soluble form of TMPRSS11A, in which the cytoplasmic tail and the transmembrane domain were replaced with the signal peptide of IgK (Fig. 5A) (35Knappe S. Wu F. Masikat M.R. Morser J. Wu Q. Functional analysis of the transmembrane domain and activation cleavage of human corin: design and characterization of a soluble corin.J. Biol.

In addition, we made another plasmid expressing an inactive soluble TMPRSS11A mutant (soluble S368A), in which the catalytic Ser368 was replaced by Ala (Fig. 5A). As expected, TMPRSS11A WT, but not soluble TMPRSS11A (s11A), was found on the surface of transfected HEK293 cells in flow cytometry (Fig. 5B). In Western blotting, we found all three bands of ∼57/53, ∼37, and ∼28 kDa, respectively, in lysates from HEK293 cells expressing TMPRSS11A WT and s11A (Fig. 5C), indicating that soluble TMPRSS11A undergoes similar intracellular activation cleavage and that the transmembrane domain is not required for TMPRSS11A autoactivation. We next incubated the conditioned medium containing s11A with a recombinant SARS–CoV-2 S protein fragment corresponding to the nearly entire extracellular region (residues 16-1213) produced from insect cells. We detected a ∼60-kDa band (Fig. 5D), which is close to the calculated molecular mass of the cleaved S2 fragment (59 kDa). The ∼60-kDa band was not detected in samples from vector-transfected cells or cells expressing the inactive soluble TMPRSS11A S368A (Fig. 5D). In a positive control, a similar ∼60-kDa band was observed when we used the conditioned medium from cells expressing a soluble form of TMPRSS2, which cleaves SARS–CoV-2 S protein (22Hoffmann M. Kleine-Weber H. Schroeder S. Krüger N. Herrler T. Erichsen S. Schiergens T.S. Herrler G. Wu N.H. Nitsche A. Müller M.A. Drosten C. Pöhlmann S. SARS-CoV-2 cell entry depends on ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and is blocked by a clinically proven protease inhibitor.Cell. 2020; 181 (32142651): 271-280.e27810.1016/j.cell.2020.02.052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11601) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5D). We did not detect any SARS–CoV-2 S protein fragments of ∼45 kDa, which is the calculated molecular mass of the S2' fragment. These results indicate that TMPRSS11A is capable of cleaving SARS–CoV-2 S protein at least in vitro. The results described above support TMPRSS11A autoactivation. It was unclear if the autoactivation cleavage of TMPRSS11A occurs in cis (intramolecular) or in trans (intermolecular). To address this question, we further analyzed the soluble S368A mutant (sS368A) (Fig. 5A). In transfected HEK293 cells, sS368A was detected in the conditioned medium, as expected (Fig. 6A). On Western blots, the sS368A fragment in the conditioned medium had a higher molecular mass than that in lysates (∼57 versus ∼53 kDa) (Fig. S4). When the samples were treated with PNGase F, the sS368A fragment from the conditioned medium and lysates migrated faster at ∼53 and ∼51 kDa, respectively (Fig. S4). The results suggest that other conformational changes or post-translational modifications may account for the higher molecular mass observed in the sS368A fragment from the conditioned medium. We next transfected HEK293 cells with the plasmid expressing the sS368A mutant together with plasmids expressing TMPRSS11A WT and mutants R186A and S368A or a control vector. In Western blotting, the ∼37-kDa band derived from activation cleavage was observed in the conditioned medium from HEK293 cells co-expressing TMPRSS11A WT, but not mutants R186A and S368A (Fig. 6B), indicating that intermolecular cleavage of TMPRSS11A did occur under our experimental conditions. We then did another experiment, in which plasmid expressing the sS368A mutant was co-transfected with plasmids expressing TMPRSS11A, hepsin, TMPRSS2, and corin in HEK293 cells. In Western blotting of the conditioned medium, the ∼37-kDa band from the sS368A mutant was detected in samples from TMPRSS11A-, hepsin- and TMPRSS2-expressing, but not corin-expressing, cells. The levels of this band, however, were much lower in samples from hepsin- and TMPRSS2-expressing cells than that in TMPRSS11A-expressing cells (Fig. S5). These results support the idea of TMPRSS11A autoactivation, although the possibility that other TTSP-mediated transactivation cleavage may occur cannot be excluded. Hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitors 1 and 2 (HAI-1 and HAI-2) are structurally related type I transmembrane serine protease inhibitors (36Kataoka H. Kawaguchi M. Fukushima T. Shimomura T.

Delayed recurrences arise from disseminated tumors cells (DTCs) in sites such as bone marrow that remain quiescent during endocrine therapy and subsequently proliferate to produce clinically detectable metastases. Identifying therapies that eliminate DTCs and/or effectively target cells transitioning to proliferation promises to reduce risk of recurrence. To tackle this problem, we utilized a 3D co-culture model incorporating ER+ breast cancer cells and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells to represent DTCs in a bone marrow niche. 3D co-cultures maintained cancer cells in a quiescent, viable state as measured by both single-cell and population-scale imaging. Single-cell imaging methods for metabolism by fluorescence lifetime (FLIM) of NADH and signaling by kinases Akt and ERK revealed that breast cancer cells utilized oxidative phosphorylation and signaling by Akt to a greater extent both in 3D co-cultures and a mouse model of ER+ breast cancer cells in bone marrow. Using our 3D co-culture model, we discovered that combination therapies targeting oxidative phosphorylation via the thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) inhibitor, D9, and the Akt inhibitor, MK-2206, preferentially eliminated breast cancer cells without altering viability of bone marrow stromal cells. Treatment of mice with disseminated ER+ human breast cancer showed that D9 plus MK-2206 blocked formation of new metastases more effectively than tamoxifen. These data establish an integrated experimental system to investigate DTCs in bone marrow and identify combination therapy against metabolic and kinase targets as a promising approach to effectively target these cells and reduce risk of recurrence in breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3042358367,"Purpose Systemic inflammation and coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD) may be causal drivers of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). We tested the hypothesis that subclinical inflammation is associated with non-endothelial dependent CMD and diastolic dysfunction. Methods In a cross-sectional study of 336 women with angina but no flow limiting coronary artery stenosis (180 with diabetes) and 95 asymptomatic controls, blood samples were analysed for 90 biomarkers of which 34 were part of inflammatory pathways. CMD was assessed as coronary flow velocity reserve (CFVR) by transthoracic Doppler echocardiography and defined as CFVR<2.5. We used E/e’ as an indicator of diastolic function in age-adjusted linear regressions to assess correlations between biomarkers, CFVR and diastolic function. Results CMD was found in 59% of participants whereas only 4% fulfilled strict criteria for diastolic dysfunction. Thirty-five biomarkers, 17 of them inflammatory, were negatively correlated with CFVR and 25, 15 inflammatory, were positively correlated with E/e’. A total of 13 biomarkers, 9 inflammatory, were associated with both CFVR and E/e’. CFVR and E/e’ were only correlated in the subgroup of patients with CMD and signs of increased filling pressure (E/e’>10) (p = 0.012). Conclusion This is the first study to link a large number of mainly inflammatory biomarkers to both CMD and E/e’, thus confirming a role of inflammation in both conditions. However, despite a high prevalence of CMD, few patients had diastolic dysfunction and the data do not support a major pathophysiologic role of non-endothelial dependent CMD in diastolic dysfunction."

https://openalex.org/W3043377345,"Neuropathic pain is a common symptom of multiple sclerosis (MS) and current treatment options are ineffective. In this study, we investigated whether endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) contributes to pain hypersensitivity in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of MS. Inflammatory cells and increased levels of ER stress markers are evident in post-mortem DRGs from MS patients. Similarly, we observed ER stress in the DRG of mice with EAE and relieving ER stress with a chemical chaperone, 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA), reduced pain hypersensitivity. In vitro, 4-PBA and the selective PERK inhibitor, AMG44, normalize cytosolic Ca2+ transients in putative DRG nociceptors. We went on to assess disease-mediated changes in the functional properties of Ca2+-sensitive BK-type K+ channels in DRG neurons. We found that the conductance-voltage (GV) relationship of BK channels was shifted to a more positive voltage, together with a more depolarized resting membrane potential in EAE cells. Our results suggest that ER stress in sensory neurons of MS patients and mice with EAE is a source of pain and that ER stress modulators can effectively counteract this phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W3043023507,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis has evolved numerous type VII secretion (ESX) systems to secrete multiple factors important for both growth and virulence across their cell envelope. ESX-1, ESX-3, and ESX-5 systems have been shown to each secrete a distinct set of substrates, including PE and PPE families of proteins, named for conserved Pro-Glu and Pro-Pro-Glu motifs in their N termini. Proper secretion of the PE–PPE proteins requires the presence of EspG, with each system encoding its own unique copy. There is no cross-talk between any of the ESX systems, and how each EspG recognizes its subset of PE–PPE proteins is currently unknown. The only current structural characterization of PE–PPE–EspG heterotrimers is from the ESX-5 system. Here we present the crystal structure of the PE5mt–PPE4mt–EspG3mm heterotrimer from the ESX-3 system. Our heterotrimer reveals that EspG3mm interacts exclusively with PPE4mt in a similar manner to EspG5, shielding the hydrophobic tip of PPE4mt from solvent. The C-terminal helical domain of EspG3mm is dynamic, alternating between open and closed forms, and this movement is likely functionally relevant in the unloading of PE–PPE heterodimers at the secretion machinery. In contrast to the previously solved ESX-5 heterotrimers, the PE–PPE heterodimer of our ESX-3 heterotrimer is interacting with its chaperone at a drastically different angle and presents different faces of the PPE protein to the chaperone. We conclude that the PPE–EspG interface from each ESX system has a unique shape complementarity that allows each EspG to discriminate among noncognate PE–PPE pairs."
https://openalex.org/W3023485345,"Cereblon (CRBN) is a substrate recruiter element of the E3 cullin 4-RING ubiquitin ligase complex, and a binding target of immunomodulatory agents (IMiDs). CRBN is responsible for the pleiotropic effects of IMiDs, yet its function in angiogenesis and in mediating the antiangiogenic effects of IMiDs remains unclear. We investigated the role of CRBN in the angiogenic process and in propagating the antiangiogenic effects of IMiDs in vitro. siRNA-mediated CRBN knock down in human endothelial cells (HUVEC and HMVEC-L), did not affect endothelial cell proliferation, migration, or tube formation. Using CRBN-deficient mice, we further demonstrated that microvessal formation can occur independently of cereblon in the ex vivo mouse aortic ring model. The cereblon E3 ubiquitin ligase complex can recruit endothelial cell-specific factors, AGO2 (associated with angiogenesis), and SALL4 (associated with embryogenesis/angiogenesis), for ubiquitin-mediated degradation. Knockdown of CRBN caused a corresponding increase in AGO2 and SALL4 protein expression and IMiD treatment was able to rescue the siCRBN effect to increase the CRBN expression. These findings suggest one potential mechanism of action that likely involves a tightly coordinated regulation of CRBN with endothelial cell targets and highlight the need to further elucidate the mechanism(s), which could include cereblon-independent pathways, through which IMiDs exert their antiangiogenic effects."
https://openalex.org/W3042378129,"Background Increased arterial resistance is a potential pathological mechanism of cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD). Aim In this study, we aimed to investigate the association between pulsatility index (PI) representing cerebral arterial resistance and subtypes of cSVD in patients with lacunar stroke. Methods We included consecutive lacunar stroke patients between 2010 and 2013. White matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume was rated using semi-automated quantitative methods. Additionally, the presence of old lacunar infarct (OLI), cerebral microbleed (CMB), or enlarged perivascular space (EPVS) was also evaluated. The relationship between PI, measured in each middle cerebral artery, and the subtype/burden of cSVD was analyzed in the relevant hemisphere. Results A total of 206 lacunar patients were included and 412 hemispheres were analyzed (mean age: 64 years, male: 68.4%). In multivariable analysis, PI was positively associated with the WMH volume [beta = 1.372, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.624 to 2.120, P < 0.001] after adjusting for confounders. PI was also related to the presence of OLI (adjusted odds ratio = 11.37, 95% CI = 2.55–48.56, P = 0.001); however, this relationship was not significant in CMB or EPVS. Regarding the cSVD burden, PI increased according to the WMH tertiles (P for trend < 0.001), the burden of OLI (P for trend < 0.001), and EPVS tertiles (P for trend < 0.001), showing a quantitative relationship. Conclusions Ipsilateral PI is closely associated with cSVD in patients with lacunar stroke. Furthermore, this association is different between subtypes of cSVD, which is suggestive of underlying pathophysiological differences."
https://openalex.org/W3043340856,"Aim Most predictive models for falls developed previously were awkward to use because of their complexity. We developed and validated a new easier-to-use predictive model for falls of adult inpatients using easily accessible information including the public ADL scale in Japan. Methods We retrospectively analyzed data from Japanese adult inpatients in an acute care hospital from 2012 to 2015. Two-thirds of cases were randomly extracted to the test set and one-third to the validation set. Data including age, sex, activity of daily living (ADL), public scales in Japan of ADL “bedriddenness rank,” and cognitive function in daily living, hypnotic medications, previous falls, and emergency admission were derived from hospital records. Falls during hospitalization were identified from incident reports. Two predictive models were created by multivariate analysis, each of which was assessed by area under the curve (AUC) from the validation set. Results A total of 7,858 adult participants were available. The AUC of model 1, using 13 factors—age, sex (male), emergency admission, use of ambulance, referral letter, admission to Neurosurgery, admission to Internal Medicine, use of hypnotic medication, permanent damage by stroke, history of falls, visual impairment, independence of eating, and bedriddenness rank—with low mutual collinearity and showing significant relationship by multivariate logistic regression analysis, was 0.789 in the validation set. The AUC of parsimonious model 2, using age and seven factors—sex (male), emergency admission, admission to Neurosurgery, use of hypnotic medication, history of falls, independence of eating, and bedriddenness rank—showing statistical significance by multivariate analysis in model 1, was 0.787 in the validation set. Conclusions We proposed new predictive models for inpatients’ fall using the public ADL scales in Japan, which had a higher degree of usability because of their use of simpler and fewer (8 or 13) predictors, especially parsimonious model 2."
https://openalex.org/W3043429422,"Peroxidasin is a heme peroxidase that oxidizes bromide to hypobromous acid (HOBr), a powerful oxidant that promotes the formation of the sulfilimine crosslink in collagen IV in basement membranes. We investigated whether HOBr released by peroxidasin leads to other oxidative modifications of proteins, particularly bromination of tyrosine residues, in peroxidasin-expressing PFHR9 cells. Using stable isotope dilution LC-MS/MS, we detected the formation of 3-bromotyrosine, a specific biomarker of HOBr-mediated protein modification. The level of 3-bromotyrosine in extracellular matrix proteins from normally cultured cells was 1.1 mmol/mol tyrosine and decreased significantly in the presence of the peroxidasin inhibitor, phloroglucinol. A negligible amount of 3-bromotyrosine was detected in peroxidasin-knockout cells. 3-Bromotyrosine formed both during cell growth in culture and in the isolated decellularized extracellular matrix when embedded peroxidasin was supplied with hydrogen peroxide and bromide. The level of 3-bromotyrosine was significantly higher in extracellular matrix than intracellular proteins, although a low amount was detected intracellularly. 3-Bromotyrosine levels increased with higher bromide concentrations and decreased in the presence of physiological concentrations of thiocyanate and urate. However, these peroxidase substrates showed moderate to minimal inhibition of collagen IV crosslinking. Our findings provide evidence that peroxidasin promotes the formation of 3-bromotyrosine in proteins. They show that HOBr produced by peroxidasin is selective for, but not limited to, the crosslinking of collagen IV. Based on our findings, the use of 3-bromotyrosine as a specific biomarker of oxidative damage by HOBr warrants further investigation in clinical conditions linked to high peroxidasin expression."
https://openalex.org/W3043594263,"Molecule-molecule forward scattering The classical picture of nonreactive inelastic scattering implies that a considerable transfer of translational to rotational energy should be accompanied by backward scattering. Using cross–molecular beam scattering combined with velocity map imaging, Sun et al. provide evidence of an unusual pair-correlated channel in the collision of carbon monoxide (CO) molecules, specifically 13 CO with 12 CO, both initially in the ground rotational state. These two molecules were scattered into the forward direction, both finally in the high rotational states. The experimental work is supported by quasiclassical trajectory simulations that exhibit unexpected molecular dance moves and suggest that similar effects could be expected for other molecule-molecule scattering systems.

https://openalex.org/W3042593725,"We have previously established that epigenetic regulator RING1 and YY1 binding protein (RYBP) is required for the contractility of embryonic stem (ES) cell derived cardiomyocytes (CMCs), suggesting its essential role in contractility. In order to investigate the underlying molecular events of this phenotype, we compared the transcriptomic profile of the wild type and Rybp null mutant ES cells and CMCs differentiated from these cell lines. We identified genes related to ion homeostasis, cell adhesion and sarcomeric organization affected in the Rybp null mutant CMCs, by using hierarchical gene clustering and Gene Ontology analysis. We have also demonstrated that the amount of RYBP is drastically reduced in the terminally differentiated wild type CMCs whilst it is broadly expressed in the early phase of differentiation when progenitors form. We also describe that RYBP is important for the proper expression of key cardiac transcription factors including Mesp1, Shh and Mef2c. These findings identify Rybp as a gene important for both early cardiac gene transcription and consequent sarcomere formation necessary for contractility. Since impairment of sarcomeric function and contractility plays a central role in reduced cardiac pump function leading to heart failures in human, current results might be relevant to the pathophysiology of cardiomyopathies."
https://openalex.org/W3043769033,"Both MicroRNAs and HMGB1 took part in pathological process of myocardial I/R injury though several signaling pathways. We hypothesized that mircoRNA451 (miR-451), a group of small non-coding RNAs, could improve this injury by inhibiting HMGB1. Male SD rats were randomly distributed into 5 groups and subjected to I/R process. After 24 hours of reperfusion injury, the serum content of CK and LDH, the content of MDA in tissue and activity of SOD were detected; The infarcted areas were defined by TTC staining and Evans Blue; TUNEL staining and cleaved-Caspase 3 were used to test apoptosis; HMGB1 was detected by real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR and Western Blotting. Compared with the I/R and I/R+Ad-GFP group, upregulation of miR-451 could reduce the infarcted areas, cardiomyocytes apoptosis index, expression of cleaved-caspase 3 and content of CK and LDH significantly(P<0.05); Meanwhile, upregulation of miR-451 could also obviously inhibit HMGB1, the increase of MDA and the decrease of SOD (P<0.05). So this study revealed that upregulation of miR-451 could prevent myocardial I/R injury by suppressing HMGB1."
https://openalex.org/W3042249223,"Outcomes in well-resourced, intensive care units (ICUs) in Kenya are thought to be comparable to those in high-income countries (HICs) but risk-adjusted mortality data is unavailable. We undertook an evaluation of the Aga Khan University Hospital, Nairobi ICU to analyze patient clinical-demographic characteristics, compare the performance of Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), delta-SOFA at 48 hours and Mortality Prediction Model-III (MPM-III) mortality prediction systems, and identify factors associated with increased risk of mortality.A retrospective cohort study was conducted of adult patients admitted to the ICU between January 2015 and September 2017. SOFA and MPM-III scores were determined at admission and SOFA repeated at 48 hours.Approximately 33% of patients did not meet ICU admission criteria. Mortality among the population of critically ill patients in the ICU was 31.7%, most of whom were male (61.4%) with a median age of 53.4 years. High adjusted odds of mortality were found among critically ill patients with leukemia (aOR 6.32, p<0.01), tuberculosis (aOR 3.96, p<0.01), post-cardiac arrest (aOR 3.57, p<0.01), admissions from the step-down unit (aOR 3.13, p<0.001), acute kidney injury (aOR 2.97, p<0.001) and metastatic cancer (aOR 2.45, p = 0.04). The area under the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve of admission SOFA was 0.77 (95% CI, 0.73-0.81), MPM-III 0.74 (95% CI, 0.69-0.79), delta-SOFA 0.69 (95% CI, 0.63-0.75) and 48-hour SOFA 0.83 (95% CI, 0.79-0.87). The difference between SOFA at 48 hours and admission SOFA, MPM-III and delta-SOFA was statistically significant (chi2 = 17.1, 24.2 and 26.5 respectively; p<0.001). Admission SOFA, MPM-III and 48-hour SOFA were well calibrated (p >0.05) while delta-SOFA was borderline (p = 0.05).Mortality among the critically ill was higher than expected in this well-resourced ICU. 48-hour SOFA performed better than admission SOFA, MPM-III and delta-SOFA in our cohort. While a large proportion of patients did not meet admission criteria but were boarded in the ICU, critically ill patients stepped-up from the step-down unit were unlikely to survive. Patients admitted following a cardiac arrest, and those with advanced disease such as leukemia, stage-4 HIV and metastatic cancer, had particularly poor outcomes. Policies for fair allocation of beds, protocol-driven admission criteria and appropriate case selection could contribute to lowering the risk of mortality among the critically ill to a level on par with HICs."

The biological functions of this unique hook complex–centrin arm assembly remain poorly understood. Here, we report a hook complex–associated protein named BOH2 that plays an essential role in promoting flagellum inheritance. BOH2 localizes to the hooked part of the hook complex by bridging the hook complex, the centrin arm, and the flagellum attachment zone filament. Depletion of BOH2 caused the loss of the shank part of the hook complex and its associated protein TbSmee1, disrupted the assembly of the centrin arm and the recruitment of centrin arm–associated protein CAAP1, inhibited the assembly of the flagellum attachment zone, and caused flagellum mispositioning and detachment. These results demonstrate crucial roles of BOH2 in maintaining hook complex integrity and promoting centrin arm formation and suggest that proper assembly of the hook complex–centrin arm structure facilitates flagellum inheritance.

Trypanosoma brucei is a flagellated microbial eukaryote and the causative agent of sleeping sickness in humans and nagana in cattle in sub-Saharan Africa. This early divergent parasite alternates between the insect vector tsetse fly and mammals and proliferates through binary fission inside the insect and mammalian hosts. During its cell division cycle, T. brucei duplicates and segregates its flagellum and multiple flagellum-associated cytoskeletal structures and, upon cell division, produces two identical daughter cells, each of which inherits a single copy of flagellum and flagellum-associated cytoskeletal structures. The flagellum is nucleated from the basal body, a centriole-like microtubule-organizing center located at the posterior portion of the cell (1Hu H. Liu Y. Zhou Q. Siegel S. Li Z.

The hooked part of the hook complex sits atop the TbBILBO1-labeled flagellar pocket collar and runs alongside the specialized quartet microtubules, and the shank part of the hook complex and the centrin arm flank the FAZ filament (19Esson H.J.

Knockdown of BOH1, which localizes to the fishhook part of the hook complex resembling a fishing bait hung on a fishhook, impairs flagellum inheritance and cytokinesis initiation (22Pham K.T.M.

It is therefore of paramount interest to localize these proteins to specific subdomains of the hook complex and determine their functions for a better understanding of the function of this unusual flagellum-associated cytoskeletal structure. In this paper, we report a kinetoplastid-specific protein named BOH2, which partly co-localizes with BOH1 at the hooked part of the hook complex, and characterize its function by RNAi-mediated gene ablation in the procyclic form of T. brucei. Our results suggest that BOH2 maintains the integrity of the hook complex and promotes the biogenesis of the centrin arm, thereby facilitating flagellum inheritance. These findings highlight an unusual role of BOH2 in controlling the assembly of the flagellum-associated hook complex–centrin arm structure and demonstrate the essential function of the hook complex in FAZ nucleation and elongation and flagellum inheritance. To identify the binding partners and near neighbors of BOH1, we carried out BioID using BOH1 as bait. BOH1 fused with a C-terminal BirA*-HA was expressed in the procyclic form of T. brucei (Fig. S1B) and was localized to the hook complex (Fig. S1C). Biotinylated proteins from both the noninduced control and tetracycline-induced cells were purified (Fig. S1D) and analyzed by MS (Tables S1 and S2). Among the highly enriched (Mascot score > 100) proteins identified by BOH1 BioID, eight proteins localize to the vicinity of BOH1 (Fig. S1E and Table S2), of which two proteins (Tb927.5.570 and Tb927.10.3010) localize to the hook complex. Tb927.10.3010 localizes to the entire hook complex, displaying a fishhook-like morphology similar to TbMORN1 and TbLRRP1 (23Morriswood B. Havlicek K. Demmel L. Yavuz S. Sealey-Cardona M. Vidilaseris K. Anrather D. Kostan J. Djinovic-Carugo K. Roux K.J. Warren G. Novel bilobe components in Trypanosoma brucei identified using proximity-dependent biotinylation.Eukaryot. Cell. 2013; 12 (23264645): 356-36710.1128/EC.00326-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), whereas Tb927.5.570 displays a bar-shaped structure similar to BOH1 (www.tryptag.org). Immunofluorescence microscopy confirmed that Tb927.5.570 partly co-localized with BOH1 (Fig. 1A); therefore, we named it BOH2 for bait on hook 2. BOH2 is a large protein (2127 aa) containing four coiled-coil motifs (aa 358–385, 602–622, 853–873, and 1483–1503), and its homologs are only found in kinetoplastid parasites, including Trypanosoma cruzi (TcCLB.507867) and Leishmania major (LmjF.05.1190), suggesting that BOH2 is a kinetoplastid-specific protein. Using three-dimensional structured illumination microscopy (3D-SIM) superresolution microscopy, BOH2 was localized to the posterior portion of BOH1 with a slight shift toward the ventral side of BOH1 (Fig. 1B and Movie S1). Both BOH2 and BOH1 proteins remained to associate with the cytoskeleton when cells were treated with detergent (Fig. 1C). To test whether BOH2 interacts with BOH1 in vivo, we carried out co-immunoprecipitation using cells co-expressing PTP-BOH1 and BOH2-3HA. We lysed the cells by sonication, which partially solubilized both proteins (Fig. 1C). Immunoprecipitation of PTP-BOH1 was not able to pull down BOH2-3HA (Fig. 1D). These results suggest that BOH2 and BOH1 are two neighboring proteins in the hook complex without forming a complex or interacting with each other. We further investigated the localization of BOH2 relative to those flagellum-associated cytoskeletal structures, such as the hook complex, the centrin arm, and the FAZ filament, by immunofluorescence microscopy and 3D-SIM superresolution microscopy. Co-immunofluorescence microscopic analysis of BOH2 and TbMORN1 showed that BOH2 localized to the hook part of the hook complex, resembling a fishing bait hung on a fishhook, similar to the localization of BOH1 (Fig. 2 (A and B) and Movie S2). The anterior portion of BOH2 overlapped with the centrin arm marked by TbCentrin4 (Fig. 2 (A and C) and Movie S3) and with the proximal ends of both the FAZ filament marked by CC2D (Fig. 2 (A and D) and Movie S4) and the shank part of the hook complex marked by TbSmee1 (Fig. 2 (A and E) and Movie S5). The localization of BOH2 to the hook part of the hook complex and its partial overlapping with other hook complex–associated structures suggest that BOH2 might play a role in maintaining hook complex morphology or promoting hook complex assembly. To understand the biological function of BOH2, we carried out a tetracycline-inducible RNAi in the procyclic (insect) form of T. brucei. Induction of BOH2 RNAi by tetracycline caused a gradual depletion of BOH2 protein, which was endogenously tagged with a triple HA epitope, as detected by Western blotting using the anti-HA antibody (Fig. 3A). Depletion of BOH2 caused severe growth defects after only 1 day of RNAi induction (Fig. 3B), indicating that BOH1 is essential for cell proliferation of the procyclic form. We next examined whether BOH2 RNAi affected cell-cycle progression by counting the cells with different numbers of kinetoplasts (K) and nuclei (N) before and after BOH2 RNAi induction. Trypanosome cells at different cell-cycle stages contain different numbers of kinetoplast and nucleus. Cells in G1 to S phase contain one nucleus and one kinetoplast (1N1K), cells in G2 to metaphase contain one nucleus and two kinetoplasts (1N2K), and cells in subsequent cell-cycle stages contain two nuclei and two kinetoplasts (2N2K). Induction of BOH2 RNAi for 24 h caused a decrease of 1N1K and 1N2K cells and an increase of 2N2K cells (Fig. 3C). Some abnormal cell types, such as the cells containing only the kinetoplast but no nucleus (0N1K), cells containing two nuclei and one kinetoplast (2N1K), and cells containing multiple (>2) nuclei and various numbers (≥1) of the kinetoplast (xNyK, where x > 2 and y ≥ 1), also increased (Fig. 3C). After RNAi induction for 48 h, the 2N2K cells and the abnormal 0N1K and 2N1K cells all decreased, whereas the abnormal xNyK cells increased to ∼80% of the total cell population (Fig. 3C). These results suggest that knockdown of BOH2 inhibited cell division. Knockdown of BOH2 caused the detachment of the new flagellum, which occurred from as early as 16 h of RNAi and was detected in ∼77% of the total cell population after 48 h (Fig. 3, D and E). Moreover, the detached new flagellum also appeared to be not well-separated from the old flagellum (Fig. 3E). These results suggest that knockdown of BOH2 impaired the attachment and positioning of the newly formed flagellum. We examined the effect of BOH2 on FAZ assembly by immunofluorescence microscopy using anti-CC2D antibody to label the intracellular FAZ filament (9Zhou Q. Liu B. Sun Y. He C.Y. A coiled-coil- and C2-domain-containing protein is required for FAZ assembly and cell morphology in Trypanosoma brucei.J. Cell Sci. 2011; 124 (22114307): 3848-385810.1242/jcs.087676Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Trypanosome cells start to assemble a new FAZ in the S-phase of the cell cycle, and the newly formed FAZ gradually elongates from a short, new FAZ (snFAZ) or a FAZ root to a full-length, new FAZ during cell-cycle progression from S-phase until the completion of mitosis. Therefore, among the noninduced control cells, the 1N1K cells (G1 and S phases) contain either one FAZ, one FAZ and one snFAZ, or two FAZs, whereas the 1N2K cells (G2 to metaphase) and the 2N2K cells (anaphase to telophase) all contain two FAZs (Fig. 3, E and F). Among the cells depleted of BOH2, the 1N1K cells with one FAZ increased by ∼13%, whereas the 1N2K and 2N2K cells with two FAZs decreased by ∼77 and ∼80%, respectively (Fig. 3F). Consequently, the 1N1K cells with two FAZs decreased by ∼8%, whereas the 1N2K and 2N2K cells with one FAZ increased to ∼34 and ∼21%, respectively (Fig. 3F). Additionally, the 1N2K and 2N2K cells with one FAZ and one snFAZ increased to ∼43 and ∼59%, respectively (Fig. 3F). Strikingly, among the abnormal 2N1K cells, ∼74% of them contained one FAZ, and the rest contained one FAZ and one snFAZ (Fig. 3F). The generation of cells without a new FAZ suggests that FAZ nucleation was inhibited, and the generation of cells with a snFAZ (or a FAZ root) suggests defective FAZ elongation. Thus, BOH2 is required for both the nucleation and the elongation steps of the FAZ assembly process. The localization of BOH2 to the hook complex (Figure 1, Figure 2) implies that BOH2 might play roles in promoting hook complex formation or maintaining hook complex morphology. We investigated these possibilities by immunofluorescence microscopy using TbMORN1 and TbLRRP1-3HA to label the hook complex and by 3D-SIM superresolution microscopy using TbMORN1 to label the hook complex. In the noninduced control cells, both the new and the old hook complexes displayed a typical fishhook-like morphology (Fig. 4 (A and B) and Movie S6). In BOH2 RNAi cells, the old hook complex retained the fishhook-like morphology, but the new hook complex appeared to lose the shank part, and the hooked part assumed a bar-shaped morphology instead of a hook-shaped morphology observed in the control cells (Fig. 4, (A and B) and Movie S7). To quantitatively analyze the defect of BOH2 knockdown on the hook complex, we measured the length of the hook complex, which was defined as the distance from the end of the hooked part of the hook complex to the distal tip of the shank part of the hook complex. We found that the old hook complex was not affected by BOH2 RNAi, but the new hook complex in the BOH2 RNAi cells was significantly shorter than that in the control cells (Fig. 4C). Because BOH2 knockdown caused the loss of the shank part of the new hook complex, we examined whether TbSmee1, which localizes to the shank part of the hook complex (21Perry J.A. Sinclair-Davis A.N. McAllaster M.R. de Graffenried C.L. TbSmee1 regulates hook complex morphology and the rate of flagellar pocket uptake in Trypanosoma brucei.Mol. Microbiol. 2018; 107 (29178204): 344-36210.1111/mmi.13885Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), was affected. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that knockdown of BOH2 inhibited the localization of TbSmee1, which was endogenously tagged with a triple HA epitope and detected by anti-HA antibody, to the new hook complex (Fig. 4D). Quantitative analysis showed that cells with strong TbSmee1 signal in the new hook complex were decreased by ∼84 and ∼88% for 1N2K and 2N2K cells, respectively, whereas cells without TbSmee1 signal in the new hook complex increased to ∼76 and ∼78% for 1N2K and 2N2K cells, respectively (Fig. 4E). Additionally, those 1N2K and 2N2K cells with weak TbSmee1 signal in the new hook complex were also increased by ∼8 and ∼9%, respectively (Fig. 4E). The striking effect of BOH2 RNAi on TbSmee1 localization prompted us to test whether BOH2 interacts with TbSmee1 by co-immunoprecipitation. The results showed that the two proteins did not interact in vivo in trypanosomes (Fig. S1F). Thus, the disrupted localization of TbSmee1 in BOH2 RNAi cells was very likely due to the loss of the shank part of the hook complex, with which TbSmee1 associates. Taken together, these results suggest that BOH2 is essential for maintaining the integrity of the hook complex and the localization of proteins that associate with the shank part of the hook complex. The anterior part of BOH2 fluorescence signal overlaps with the centrin arm (Fig. 2), implying that BOH2 might be involved in centrin arm formation. We thus examined this possibility by immunofluorescence microscopy using anti-centrin antibodies to stain the centrin arm. These antibodies, such as the pan-centrin antibody 20H5 (15He C.Y. Pypaert M. Warren G. Golgi duplication in Trypanosoma brucei requires Centrin2.Science. 2005; 310 (16254149): 1196-119810.1126/science.1119969Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and the anti-LdCen1/TbCentrin4 antibody (25Selvapandiyan A.

Wright B. Milstein C. Rat monoclonal antitubulin antibodies derived by using a new nonsecreting rat cell line.J.

The centriole cartwheel protein SAS-6 in Trypanosoma brucei is required for probasal body biogenesis and flagellum assembly.Eukaryot. Cell. 2015; 14 (26116214): 898-90710.1128/EC.00083-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In the noninduced control cells, the centrin arm was detected by both 20H5 and anti-LdCen1/TbCentrin4 antibodies as a small bar-shaped structure next to the basal body, which was labeled by YL 1/2 and anti-TbSAS-6 antibodies (Fig. 5A). In BOH2 RNAi cells, the old centrin arm was still detected by 20H5 and anti-LdCen1/TbCentrin4 antibodies, but the new centrin arm was missing in ∼85 and ∼96% of the 1N2K and 2N2K cells, respectively (Fig. 5, A–C). Quantitative analysis by measuring the length of the centrin arm showed that the average length of the new centrin arm was significantly reduced (∼1.1 μm in control cells versus ∼0.4 μm in the RNAi cells that still had a new centrin arm) after BOH2 RNAi (Fig. 5D), confirming that BOH2 knockdown disrupted the assembly of the new centrin arm. We next asked whether the localization of centrin arm–associated proteins to the new centrin arm was affected in BOH2 RNAi cells. To date, only one protein (Tb927.10.1450) has been found to localize to the centrin arm besides the two centrin proteins (23Morriswood B. Havlicek K. Demmel L. Yavuz S. Sealey-Cardona M. Vidilaseris K. Anrather D. Kostan J. Djinovic-Carugo K. Roux K.J. Warren G. Novel bilobe components in Trypanosoma brucei identified using proximity-dependent biotinylation.Eukaryot. Cell. 2013; 12 (23264645): 356-36710.1128/EC.00326-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and we named this protein CAAP1 for centrin arm–associated protein 1. CAAP1 was endogenously tagged with a triple HA epitope in the BOH2 RNAi cell line and was detected by immunofluorescence microscopy and 3D-SIM superresolution microscopy. In all of the BOH2 RNAi cells that had lost the new centrin arm, CAAP1 fluorescence signal in the new centrin arm was much weaker than that in the control cells (Fig. 5 (E and F) and Movies S8 and S9). This suggests that disruption of the new centrin arm by depletion of BOH2 impairs the localization of the centrin arm–associated protein CAAP1. The striking effects of BOH2 knockdown on the formation of the new centrin arm (Fig. 5) and the morphogenesis of the new hook complex (Fig. 4) prompted us to investigate whether disruption of the centrin arm or the hook complex might affect BOH2 localization. We first investigated the potential effect of centrin arm disruption on BOH2 localization. To date, three centrin arm–localizing proteins, TbCentrin2, TbCentrin4, and CAAP1, have been identified, but none of them have been reported to be involved in centrin arm duplication. TbCentrin2 is required for Golgi duplication (15He C.Y. Pypaert M. Warren G. Golgi duplication in"

ATR Ser/Thr kinase (ATR) is a principal kinase in the DNA damage response and is activated in response to UV– and chemotherapeutic drug–induced DNA replication stress, but its role in cellular responses to 5-FU is unclear. In this study, we examined the effect of ATR inhibition on 5-FU sensitivity of mammalian cells. Using immunoblotting, we found that 5-FU treatment dose-dependently induced the phosphorylation of ATR at the autophosphorylation site Thr-1989 and thereby activated its kinase. Administration of 5-FU with a specific ATR inhibitor remarkably decreased cell survival, compared with 5-FU treatment combined with other major DNA repair kinase inhibitors. Of note, the ATR inhibition enhanced induction of DNA double-strand breaks and apoptosis in 5-FU–treated cells. Using gene expression analysis, we found that 5-FU induced the activation of the intra-S cell-cycle checkpoint. Cells lacking BRCA2 were sensitive to 5-FU in the presence of ATR inhibitor. Moreover, ATR inhibition enhanced the efficacy of the 5-FU treatment, independently of the nonhomologous end-joining and homologous recombination repair pathways.

One of many anticancer agents available, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) has nonetheless become the drug of choice in the treatment of various solid tumors because of its properties. It converts to a number of active metabolites (such as fluorouridine triphosphate, fluorodeoxyuridine triphosphate (FdUTP), and fluorodeoxyuridine monophosphate (FdUMP)) that disrupt RNA and DNA metabolism and inhibit thymidylate synthase (TS) (1Longley D.B.

Specifically, global RNA metabolism is compromised when the following conditions take place: 1) RNA absorbs the 5-FU–converted active metabolite, fluorouridine triphosphate, in place of UTP, and 2) FdUTP, instead of dTTP, is absorbed by DNA (2Miura K.

The absorption of FdUMP contributes to an inhibition of TS via the formation of a ternary covalent complex that consists of TS-FdUMP-5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate. It also blocks cells from the synthesis of dTMP from dUMP, causing cellular dUTP increases at the expense of dTTP. This leads to a significant misincorporation of dUTP or FdUTP during replication and, in particular, that of DNA.

The BER enzyme uracil-DNA-glycosylase initiates repair of DNA through the elimination of uracil or 5-FU from DNA (8Lindahl T. An N-glycosidase from Escherichia coli that releases free uracil from DNA containing deaminated cytosine residues.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71 (4610583): 3649-365310.1073/pnas.71.9.3649Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). However, this repair mechanism is rendered ineffective, given high FdUTP/dTTP ratios, and only serves to trigger the incorporation of additional false nucleotides (4Wyatt M.D. Wilson D.M. Participation of DNA repair in the response to 5-fluorouracil.Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2009; 66 (18979208): 788-79910.1007/s00018-008-8557-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The MMR system plays an equally significant role in the correction of such replication errors via the nicks and gaps in single-strand DNA (ssDNA) produced by the FdUTP and dUTP in both BER and MMR (4Wyatt M.D. Wilson D.M. Participation of DNA repair in the response to 5-fluorouracil.Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2009; 66 (18979208): 788-79910.1007/s00018-008-8557-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). These nicks and gaps trigger the initial activation of ATR-checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) pathways, and activated Chk1 molecules, in turn, stop DNA replication. During these processes, unstable conformations in the DNA structure are induced by the coating of stalled replication fork complexes with replication protein A. The presence of excessive single-strand breaks (SSBs) at stalled replication forks subsequently induces DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in 5-FU–treated cells (9Fujinaka Y. Matsuoka K. Iimori M.

DNA damage response (DDR) involves the activation of a signaling network that provides time for DNA repair and triggers apoptosis when extensive damage occurs. It effectively mediates cell-cycle arrest and is triggered by the activation of protein kinases, ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), ATM and Rad3-related (ATR), and DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs), which is one of three members of the phosphoinositide-3-kinase-like protein kinase (PIKK) family. Cell-cycle progression in G1, S, or G2 phase is delayed as these kinases recruit repair machinery to damaged DNA sites via the activation of effector checkpoints (11Maréchal A. Zou L. DNA damage sensing by the ATM and ATR kinases.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2013; 5 (24003211): a01271610.1101/cshperspect.a012716Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar). Through p21/CIP1/WAF1 up-regulation, p53 mediates G1 arrest and, where extensive DNA damage is detected, triggers apoptosis (12Woods D. Turchi J.J. Chemotherapy induced DNA damage response: convergence of drugs and pathways.Cancer Biol. Ther. 2013; 14 (23380594): 379-38910.4161/cbt.23761Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, as a majority of cancer cells display loss of p53 function and its regulatory pathways, it is evident that chemotherapy-induced DNA damage is unable to halt G1 phase or promote apoptosis. Cells rely solely upon S and G2/M checkpoints for the arrest of the cell cycle and facilitation of DNA repair after genotoxic exposure and prior to mitosis. ATR/Chk1 kinases have been found to be implicated in the regulation of post-genotoxic stress cell-cycle arrest, impediment of subsequent replication origin firing during S phase, and involvement in the intra-S and G2/M checkpoints (13Heffernan T.P.

We previously demonstrated that BRCA2, a major component of the HR repair pathway, plays a crucial role in protecting cells from cell death and in the repair of DNA damage induced by 5-FU (3Nakagawa Y.

ATR is activated in response to replication stress induced by DNA-damaging reagents and acts upon the upstream of BRCA2-dependent repair pathway (25Matsuoka S. Ballif B.A. Smogorzewska A.

ATR is one of the principal kinases of the DNA damage response, in addition to ATM and DNA-PK. In the present study, we sought to characterize the role of ATR in response to 5-FU and examine the effect of an ATR inhibitor for cancer treatment with 5-FU. To examine the activation of ATR and other major DDR kinases by 5-FU treatment, we verified the phosphorylation of ATR, ATM, DNA-PKcs, and Chk1 by Western blotting in SAS cells. The phosphorylation of ATR at Thr-1989 (an autophosphorylation site) (29Liu S. Shiotani B. Lahiri M. Maréchal A. Tse A. Leung C.C. Glover J.N. Yang X.H. Zou L. ATR autophosphorylation as a molecular switch for checkpoint activation.Mol.

Chk1 phosphorylation at Ser-345, a substrate of ATR/ATM kinase, induced by 5-FU was also detected in a dose-dependent manner, similar to the induction of ATR phosphorylation (Fig. 1), suggesting that Chk1 phosphorylation at Ser-345 by 5-FU is ATR-dependent. On the other hand, the phosphorylation of ATM at Ser-1981 induced by 5-FU was confirmed sufficiently even at 10 μm, and more phosphorylation of DNA-PKcs at Ser-2056 induced by X-ray (20-gray) irradiation was detected than that induced by 5-FU (Fig. 1). These results suggest that 5-FU induces DNA damage to activate DDR signaling independent of simple DSBs, such as ionizing radiation–induced DSBs. To check whether the concentration of a specific inhibitor against ATR (ATRi) alone does not exceed IC50 in our experiments, we analyzed cell survival. The surviving fraction showed a slight decrease under 10 μm ATRi (Fig. S1, A and B), and the IC50 value was ∼15 μm in Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts (Fig. S1A) and 5 μm in SAS cells (Fig. S1B). Although 3 μm ATRi alone did not have cell lethality, it synergistically enhanced the cytotoxicity of 5-FU treatment (Fig. 2A). To verify the significance of ATRi compared with other major DDR kinase inhibitors against DNA-PK (DNA-PKi) and ATM (ATMi), SAS and HSC3 cells were exposed to 5 μm 5-FU and 3 μm ATRi/DNA-PKi/ATMi for 24 h and subsequently measured using a standard colony-forming assay. The number of surviving fractions was significantly lower in 5-FU treatment combined with ATRi, compared with 5-FU treatment combined with DNA-PKi or ATMi (Fig. 2A). We confirmed cell viability using a standard colony-forming assay by changing the concentration of 5-FU. The surviving fraction was remarkably decreased in the 5-FU treatment combined with ATRi compared with 5-FU alone in both SAS and HSC3 cells (Fig. 2B). The number of surviving fractions was lower in 5-FU treatment combined with ATRi, compared with 5-FU treatment combined with DNA-PKi or ATMi (Fig. 2, C and D). The surviving fraction decreases in 5-FU combined with ATRi are assumed to occur in a p53-independent manner (Fig. S1C). These findings suggest that ATRi is more effective in 5-FU treatment than DNA-PKi or ATMi. Fig. 3 (A and B) demonstrates that ATRi suppressed the phosphorylation of ATR and Chk1 induced by 5-FU, suggesting that ATRi blocks both ATR autophosphorylation and Chk1 phosphorylation. To confirm the degree of DSB induction, we performed comet assays under neutral conditions. SAS cells were treated with 10 μm 5-FU and/or 3 μm ATRi for 12 h. The tail moments by 5-FU alone and 5-FU combined with ATRi were 10.3 ± 2.5% and 48.1 ± 12.8%, respectively (Fig. 4 (A and B) and Fig. S2). The tail moments of 5-FU treatment combined with ATRi were significantly increased (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that ATR inhibition enhances DSB accumulation in cells treated with 5-FU. In addition, we performed another method for detecting DSBs. γH2AX immunocytochemical staining is a sensitive method by which DSBs can be detected (30Takahashi A. Ohnishi T. Does γH2AX foci formation depend on the presence of DNA double strand breaks?.Cancer Lett. 2005; 229 (16129552): 171-17910.1016/j.canlet.2005.07.016Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). This was used to examine the presence of H2AX phosphorylation induced by 5-FU and ATRi. Fig. 5A depicts a typical H2AX phosphorylation in SAS cells after 12-h treatment with 10 μm 5-FU and/or 3 μm ATRi. The percentages of H2AX phosphorylation (≥25 foci/cell)–positive cells treated with ATRi alone, 5-FU alone, and 5-FU combined with ATRi were 0.7 ± 0.5, 45.2 ± 12.5, and 78.4 ± 3.6%, respectively, whereas the percentages of pan-nuclear H2AX phosphorylation–positive cells treated with ATRi alone, 5-FU alone, and 5-FU combined with ATRi were 0.0 ± 0.0, 4.7 ± 1.5, and 35.5 ± 4.0%, respectively (Fig. 5B). A significant increase in γH2AX foci or pan-nuclear γH2AX was observed in cells treated with 5-FU combined with ATRi (Fig. 5C). These results suggest that ATR inhibition enhances γH2AX foci formation in cells treated with 5-FU. To quantify the optical intensity of H2AX phosphorylation using flow cytometry, cells were exposed to 10 μm 5-FU with or without 3 μm ATRi for 6 and 12 h (Fig. 6A). The intensity of H2AX phosphorylation treated with 5-FU alone for 6 h was 103.7 ± 0.6, and for 12 h it was 119.1 ± 0.7, whereas the intensity after a 5-FU combined with ATRi treatment for 6 h was 105.4 ± 0.3, and for 12 h it was 162.1 ± 1.8 in SAS cells (Fig. 6B). The intensity of H2AX phosphorylation treated with 5-FU alone for 6 h was 110.6 ± 0.8, and for 12 h it was 237.9 ± 2.3, and after 5-FU combined with ATRi treatment for 6 h, it was 118.7 ± 0.6, and for 12 h it was 364.3 ± 3.8 in HSC3 cells (Fig. 6B). Our findings suggest that ATR inhibition leads to a less efficient repair of 5-FU–induced DNA damage. These results suggest that ATR inhibition enhances H2AX phosphorylation in cells treated with 5-FU. To assess the apoptosis induction, cells were detected and quantified with a Hoechst33342 staining assay (Fig. 7A). The fraction of apoptosis by 3 μm ATRi alone, 10 μm 5-FU alone, and 10 μm 5-FU combined with 3 μm ATRi for 12 h was 12.9 ± 5.3, 15.6 ± 6.9, and 40.5 ± 5.1%, respectively, and 11.3 ± 2.0, 30.6 ± 5.8, and 59.8 ± 15.5%, respectively, for 24 h in SAS cells (Fig. 7B). Counterparts for 12 h were 8.6 ± 3.8, 15.5 ± 8.5, and 30.0 ± 16.6% respectively, and 15.6 ± 6.9, 46.0 ± 11.0, and 66.4 ± 11.5%, respectively, for 24 h in HSC3 cells (Fig. 7B). Apoptotic bodies appeared at a higher frequency in cells given 5-FU treatment combined with ATRi both in SAS and HSC3 cells (Fig. 7, A and B). These results suggest that ATR inhibition enhances apoptosis induction in cells treated with 5-FU. To analyze the cell-cycle profile after 5-FU treatment, we examined the cell-cycle distribution. When DNA fragmentation occurred, the position of apoptotic cells was shifted to lower DNA content values, and a sub-G1 population was detected far to the left of the G1 peak (31Darzynkiewicz Z. Bruno S. Del Bino G. Gorczyca W. Hotz M.A. Lassota P. Traganos F.

Cells were exposed to 10 μm 5-FU and/or 3 μm ATRi for 8, 16, and 24 h (Fig. 8A). After treatment with 5-FU alone for 8, 16, and 24 h, the fraction of sub-G1 was 3.3 ± 0.3, 14.8 ± 0.2, and 38.1 ± 2.8%, and after treatment with 5-FU and ATRi for 8, 16, and 24 h, it was 8.8 ± 0.1, 49.6 ± 3.8, and 68.1 ± 1.0% in SAS cells (Fig. 8B). The counterparts were 4.3 ± 0.1, 12.2 ± 0.2, and 15.1 ± 0.3% and 18.8 ± 0.6, 46.0 ± 1.7, and 68.2 ± 1.4% in HSC3 cells (Fig. 8B). The fraction of sub-G1 was remarkably increased in 5-FU treatment combined with ATRi compared with 5-FU treatment alone. These results suggest that ATR inhibition enhances fragmentation of cellular nucleus in cells treated with 5-FU. Based on the cell-cycle analysis, 5-FU treatment caused cell-cycle arrest in S phase at 8 and 16 h (Fig. 8A). To investigate the nature of the cell-cycle arrest involved in the response to 5-FU treatment, we analyzed genome-wide mRNA by bulk RNA-Seq. The 32 genes that regulated significantly were detected by differentially expressed gene analysis both in SAS and HSC3 (Fig. 9 (A and B), Fig. S3 (A–C), and Table S1). We then screened nine genes associated with the cell cycle from the 32 enes by gene ontology (GO) analysis. The expression of four genes, cyclin E1 (CCNE1), cyclin E2 (CCNE2), cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (CDKN1A), and thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP), were up-regulated, and five genes, cyclin B1 (CCNB1), cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 3 (CDKN3), cell division cycle 20 (CDC20), Aurora kinase A (AURKA), and proline and serine–rich coiled-coil 1 (PSRC1), were down-regulated after 10 μm 5-FU treatment for 16 h (Fig. 9B). Subsequently, we quantified these gene expressions by qRT-PCR in each cell line, and similar tendencies were indicated in all of the genes listed above (Fig. 10, A and B). Our data support the idea that 5-FU treatment leads to cell-cycle arrest between S phase and mitotic phase, particularly in S phase.Figure 10Gene expression analysis by qRT-PCR.

BRCA2, one of the HR repair components, plays an important role in repairing DNA damage induced by 5-FU (3Nakagawa Y. Kajihara A. Takahashi A. Kondo N. Mori E. Kirita T. Ohnishi T. The BRCA2 gene is a potential molecular target during 5-fluorouracil therapy in human oral cancer cells.Oncol. Rep. 2014; 31 (24627042): 2001-200610.3892/or.2014.3080Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). To investigate whether ATR inhibition affects the sensitivity of 5-FU in the absence of BRCA2, surviving fractions of the Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts were measured. We found that compared with BRCA2-proficient cells, BRCA2-deficient cells were more sensitive to 5-FU in the presence of ATRi (Fig. 11A). To further determine whether the NHEJ or HR repair pathway is more predominant against 5-FU treatment, the surviving fraction of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (WT; Lig4−/−; Rad54−/−; Lig4−/−Rad54−/−) was examined. All repair gene–defective cells were sensitive to 5-FU, but Rad54−/− cells were more sensitive to 5-FU than Lig4−/− cells. There was very little difference in the surviving fraction between Rad54−/− cells and Lig4−/−Rad54−/− cells (Fig. 11B). These results suggest that HR is more crucial than NHEJ in repairing DNA damage induced by 5-FU. Subsequently, we examined the effect of 5-FU treatment combined with ATRi on the Lig4−/−Rad54−/− cell lines. Surviving fractions of 0.5 μm ATRi alone, 0.5 μm 5-FU alone, and 0.5 μm 5-FU combined with 0.5 μm ATRi for 24 h were 85.0 ± 8.6, 91.8 ± 3.5, and 25.3 ± 3.7%, respectively (Fig. 11C). Cell viability was remarkably decreased in the 5-FU treatment combined with ATRi compared with 5-FU alone (Fig. 11C). ATR is an apical signaling kinase in the replication stress response (33Saldivar J.C. Cortez D. Cimprich K.A. The essential kinase ATR: ensuring faithful duplication of a challenging genome.Nat. Rev.

Methods A total of 213 patients who underwent total laryngectomy in a tertiary referral center for tumor ablation were enrolled retrospectively between January 2009 and May 2018. Statistical analyses including Pearson's chi-squared test were used to determine whether there was a significant difference between each selected clinical factors and outcomes. The outcomes of interest including postoperative length of hospital stay and inpatient total medical cost. Logistic regression analyses were performed to reveal the relationship between clinical factors and postoperative length of hospital stay or total inpatient medical cost. Results Preoperative radiotherapy (p = 0.007), method of wound closure (p < 0.001), postoperative serum albumin level (p = 0.025), and postoperative serum hemoglobin level (p = 0.04) were significantly associated with postoperative hospital stay in univariate analysis. Postoperative hypoalbuminemia (odds ratio [OR]: 2.477; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.189–5.163; p = 0.015) and previous radiotherapy history (OR 2.194; 95% CI: 1.228–3.917; p = 0.008) are independent predictors of a longer postoperative hospital stay in multiple regression analysis. With respect to total inpatient medical cost, method of wound closure (p < 0.001), preoperative serum albumin level (p = 0.04), postoperative serum albumin level (p < 0.001), and history of liver cirrhosis (p = 0.037) were significantly associated with total inpatient medical cost in univariate analysis. Postoperative hypoalbuminemia (OR: 6.671; 95% CI: 1.927–23.093; p = 0.003) and microvascular free flap reconstruction (OR: 5.011; 95% CI: 1.657–15.156; p = 0.004) were independent predictors of a higher total inpatient medical cost in multiple regression analysis. Conclusions Postoperative albumin status is a significant factor in predicting prolonged postoperative hospital stay and higher inpatient medical cost among patients who undergo total laryngectomy. In this cohort, the inpatient medical cost was 48% higher and length of stay after surgery was 35% longer among hypoalbuminemia patients."
https://openalex.org/W3043608298,"Trans-methylation reactions are intrinsic to cellular metabolism in all living organisms. In land plants, a range of substrate-specific methyltransferases catalyze the methylation of DNA, RNA, proteins, cell wall components and numerous species-specific metabolites, thereby providing means for growth and acclimation in various terrestrial habitats. Trans-methylation reactions consume vast amounts of S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) as a methyl donor in several cellular compartments. The inhibitory reaction by-product, S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (SAH), is continuously removed by SAH hydrolase (SAHH), which essentially maintains trans-methylation reactions in all living cells. Here we report on the evolutionary conservation and post-translational control of SAHH in land plants. We provide evidence suggesting that SAHH forms oligomeric protein complexes in phylogenetically divergent land plants and that the predominant protein complex is composed by a tetramer of the enzyme. Analysis of light-stress-induced adjustments of SAHH in Arabidopsis thaliana and Physcomitrella patens further suggests that regulatory actions may take place on the levels of protein complex formation and phosphorylation of this metabolically central enzyme. Collectively, these data suggest that plant adaptation to terrestrial environments involved evolution of regulatory mechanisms that adjust the trans-methylation machinery in response to environmental cues."

Contactin-associated protein-like 2 (Caspr2) is a member of the contactin-associated protein family that belongs to the neurexin superfamily of proteins (1Poliak S. Gollan L. Martinez R. Custer A.

Similar to classical α neurexins, Caspr2 has a short C-terminal intracellular domain, a single transmembrane helix, and a large N-terminal extracellular domain (ECD).

However, surprisingly little is known about the role of Caspr2 and its potential interaction partners in the central nervous system. Studies to date have mostly focused on the consequences of disrupting Caspr2 function on the balance between excitatory and inhibitory circuits and synapse formation in the cerebral cortex (9Anderson G.R.

Notably, polymorphisms in CNTNAP2 have been associated with reduced cerebellar gray matter in humans (12Tan G.C.Y. Doke T.F. Ashburner J. Wood N.W. Frackowiak R.S.J. Normal variation in fronto-occipital circuitry and cerebellar structure with an autism-associated polymorphism of CNTNAP2.Neuroimage. 2010; 53 (20176116): 1030-104210.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.02.018Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Similarly, imaging studies in Cntnap2 knockout mice have reported an association between the homozygous deletion of Cntnap2 and altered cerebellar size (13Ellegood J. Anagnostou E.

Moreover, autoantibodies against Caspr2 have been linked to cerebellar ataxia in some patients with anti-Caspr2 antibody–associated encephalitis (14Balint B. Regula J.U. Jarius S. Wildemann B.

Thus, evidence from both patients and mice points toward a possible function for Caspr2 in the cerebellum. In this study, we find that Caspr2 is enriched at synapses in the developing cerebellum. Mutant mice lacking Cntnap2 show distinct cerebellum-associated behavioral impairments and abnormal Purkinje cell development. Interestingly, we identify type 1 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R1) as a specific synaptic interaction partner of the Caspr2 ECD in the molecular layer (ML) of the developing cerebellum. The interaction of the Caspr2 ECD with IP3R1 inhibits IP3R1-mediated changes in cellular morphology. Together, our findings suggest that Caspr2 regulates the development of Purkinje cell dendrites by interacting with IP3R1 at synapses, suggesting a novel mechanism by which Caspr2 dysfunction might lead to aberrant cerebellar behaviors and associated neurological disorders. We first investigated the temporal and spatial expression pattern of Caspr2 in the developing cerebellum. Caspr2 protein was highly expressed in the mouse cerebellum from the second week of postnatal development (Fig. 1A), which coincides temporally with the outgrowth of Purkinje cell dendrites and synapse development in the cerebellar cortex (17Kapfhammer J. Cellular and molecular control of dendritic growth and development of cerebellar Purkinje cells.Prog. Histochem. Cytochem. 2004; 39 (15580762): 131-18210.1016/j.proghi.2004.07.002Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Caspr2 protein expression remained high in the adult cerebellum (Fig. 1A), consistent with earlier studies (18Irani S.R. Alexander S. Waters P. Kleopa K.A. Pettingill P. Zuliani L. Peles E. Buckley C. Lang B. Vincent A. Antibodies to Kv1 potassium channel-complex proteins leucine-rich, glioma inactivated 1 protein and contactin-associated protein-2 in limbic encephalitis, Morvan's syndrome and acquired neuromyotonia.Brain. 2010; 133 (20663977): 2734-274810.1093/brain/awq213Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). We then assessed where in the mouse cerebellar cortex Caspr2 was expressed, focusing on the developing cerebellum. Mid-sagittal sections of postnatal day 20 (P20) mouse cerebellum were immunostained with antibodies against Caspr2 and IP3R1. The latter is specifically expressed in Purkinje cells (19Maeda N. Niinobe M. Inoue Y. Mikoshiba K. Developmental expression and intracellular location of P400 protein characteristic of Purkinje cells in the mouse cerebellum.Dev. Biol. 1989; 133 (2707487): 67-7610.1016/0012-1606(89)90297-2Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and was used as a marker to define Purkinje cells, alongside their characteristic morphology. The strongest Caspr2 signal was detected in the ML, where developing Purkinje cells make synaptic contacts with granule cell parallel fibers and in the granule cell layer (Fig. 1B). This is consistent with the presence of Caspr2 in the ML of the adult cerebellum (18Irani S.R. Alexander S. Waters P. Kleopa K.A. Pettingill P. Zuliani L. Peles E. Buckley C. Lang B. Vincent A. Antibodies to Kv1 potassium channel-complex proteins leucine-rich, glioma inactivated 1 protein and contactin-associated protein-2 in limbic encephalitis, Morvan's syndrome and acquired neuromyotonia.Brain. 2010; 133 (20663977): 2734-274810.1093/brain/awq213Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). To confirm the localization of Caspr2 to synapses, we carried out fractionation experiments. Cerebellar synaptosomes were prepared from 2-week-old mouse cerebellum, lysed, and analyzed by Western blotting. Caspr2 was found to be highly enriched in the synaptic fraction (Fig. 1C). To identify the cerebellar subsynaptic compartments in which Caspr2 is present, we isolated pre- and postsynaptic specializations from P14 mouse cerebellum. Surprisingly, Caspr2 was found in both pre- and postsynaptic compartments (Fig. 1D). Together, these results suggest that Caspr2 is highly expressed in the developing and adult cerebellum and enriched in multiple synaptic compartments. The finding that Caspr2 is strongly expressed in the cerebellum, combined with the description of phenotypes indicative of cerebellar deficits including motor deficits and language impairment in patients with reduced Caspr2 function (7Rodenas-Cuadrado P. Ho J. Vernes S.C. Shining a light on CNTNAP2: complex functions to complex disorders.Eur. J. Hum.

Motor coordination and gait was tested in Cntnap2 mutant animals and WT littermates using the static rod test and the CatWalk system, respectively. For the static rod test, animals were placed at the end of the rod, facing away from the platform, and the time taken for them to turn around and face the platform was recorded. We observed a significant effect of genotype, with Cntnap2−/− knockout (KO) mice taking longer to turn around than WT and Cntnap2+/− heterozygous (HET) littermates (Fig. 2A). Analyzing the number of paws supporting the animals as they walk, we found a significant decrease in the proportion of time KO mice were supported by the diagonal pair of paws and a corresponding increase in the proportion of time the mice were supported by three paws relative to WT and HET littermates, indicating that the KO animals have an unstable gait (Fig. 2B). This effect of genotype was detected in both juvenile (P35–42) and adult mice. Taken together, these behavioral data suggest that Caspr2 is likely important for normal cerebellar function. We next investigated Caspr2's function in the cerebellum at the cellular level. Given that Caspr2 protein expression starts within the second postnatal week, at which time the rapid growth and maturation of Purkinje cell dendrites occurs (17Kapfhammer J. Cellular and molecular control of dendritic growth and development of cerebellar Purkinje cells.Prog. Histochem. Cytochem. 2004; 39 (15580762): 131-18210.1016/j.proghi.2004.07.002Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), we set out to investigate whether Caspr2 might play a role in the dendritic development of Purkinje cells. Organotypic cerebellar slice cultures were prepared from P9 mice and cultured for 7 days before being subjected to immunostaining using an antibody against the Purkinje cell marker IP3R1. Immature Purkinje cells often display multiple primary dendrites and perisomatic protrusions before they develop their ultimate dendritic tree (20Boukhtouche F. Janmaat S. Vodjdani G. Gautheron V. Mallet J. Dusart I. Mariani J. Retinoid-related orphan receptor alpha controls the early steps of Purkinje cell dendritic differentiation.J.

Interestingly, fewer Purkinje cells taken from KO mice displayed multiple primary dendrites than those taken from WT littermates (Fig. 2, C and D). This phenotype was rescued by the addition of recombinant Caspr2 ECD (Fig. 2, C and D). Together, these findings suggest a role for the ECD of Caspr2 in regulating early Purkinje cell dendritic development. We next determined the molecular mechanism underlying Caspr2 function in the developing cerebellum. Whereas the Caspr2 ECD interacts with Contactin-2 at juxtaparanodes in the PNS (1Poliak S. Gollan L. Martinez R. Custer A. Einheber S. Salzer J.L. Trimmer J.S. Shrager P. Peles E. Caspr2, a new member of the neurexin superfamily, is localized at the juxtaparanodes of myelinated axons and associates with K+ channels.Neuron. 1999; 24 (10624965): 1037-104710.1016/S0896-6273(00)81049-1Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar) and other proteins have been reported to interact with the intracellular domain of Caspr2 (21Gao R.

To gain insight into the functional role of Caspr2 in cerebellar synapse development, we employed a proteomics approach. Recombinant, biotinylated Caspr2 ECD was coupled to streptavidin-coated beads and used to pull down interacting proteins from cerebellar synaptosomes prepared from P14 WT mice (Fig. 3A). To control for false positives due to nonspecific interactions, we used streptavidin-coated beads coated with contaminant proteins from the recombinant Caspr2 ECD purification. LC–MS/MS analysis of the pulldown experiment identified several candidate interaction partners (Fig. 3B; see Table S1 for full results). Interestingly, one of these interaction partners was the Ca2+ channel IP3R1, a key protein involved in cerebellar development and function. IP3R1 is located at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and plasma membrane in Purkinje cells (19Maeda N. Niinobe M. Inoue Y. Mikoshiba K. Developmental expression and intracellular location of P400 protein characteristic of Purkinje cells in the mouse cerebellum.Dev.

Nine separate peptide spectrum matches for IP3R1 were obtained in the test condition, compared with none in the control condition. Seven of the nine matches represented distinct sequences, with all seven being unique and significant (p < 0.05). The interaction between Caspr2 and IP3R1 was validated in co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Both Caspr2 and IP3R1 were found to be enriched in cerebellar synaptosomes, and Caspr2 specifically co-immunoprecipitated with IP3R1 from cerebellar synaptosome lysates (Fig. 3C). To determine whether the spatial distribution of the two proteins was consistent with their possible interaction in vivo, cerebellar sections (P14) were immunostained using specific antibodies directed against IP3R1 and Caspr2 and imaged using confocal microscopy. Strong Caspr2 staining was observed in the white matter (WM) and in the deep ML, whereas IP3R1 was detected in the WM and the Purkinje cell layer and throughout the ML (Fig. 3D and Fig. S1A). The degree of co-localization was quantified in both the ML and the WM using Manders split coefficients (24Manders E.M.M. Verbeek F.J. Aten J.A. Measurement of co-localization of objects in dual-colour confocal images.J. Microscopy. 1993; 169: 375-38210.1111/j.1365-2818.1993.tb03313.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (1523) Google Scholar) as this method permits the presence of additional, mutually exclusive binding partners, and IP3R1 is found in the ER and at the plasma membrane. Caspr2 and IP3R1 were found to co-occur in the deep ML, where the Mander's coefficient value for the Caspr2 channel was 0.856 (Fig. 3E). In contrast, much less co-occurrence was observed in the WM, where the Mander's coefficient value for the Caspr2 channel was 0.441 (Fig. S1B). A combination of the high density of axons in the white matter and the resolution of the imaging system used likely contributed significantly to this result. Taken together, these data are consistent with a specific interaction of Caspr2 and IP3R1 at synapses in the deep ML of the cerebellum. We next carried out structure-function analyses to determine the regions of Caspr2 and IP3R1 that associate with each other. Caspr2 and IP3R1 were found to robustly interact in lysates from HEK239FT cells overexpressing Caspr2 and IP3R1 (Fig. 3G). Interestingly, the Caspr2-IP3R1 interaction was maintained when the co-immunoprecipitation was repeated in the presence of the Ca2+-chelating agent EGTA (Fig. S2), indicating that the interaction of the two proteins is not modulated by Ca2+ levels. IP3R1 interacted strongly with a mutated Caspr2 protein, in which the ECD domains distal to the membrane were deleted (Δdisc-EGF1), and only weakly with a Caspr2 mutant missing the membrane-proximal ECD domains (Δfib-lam4) (Fig. 3H). These results suggest that the four domains that comprise the membrane-proximal region of the Caspr2 ECD are necessary for the Caspr2-IP3R1 interaction. We termed this region the juxtamembrane (JXM) region. In further experiments, we found that the Caspr2 JXM region specifically co-immunoprecipitated with IP3R1 (Fig. 3I). Thus, the Caspr2 JXM domain is both necessary and sufficient to mediate the interaction with IP3R1. We next asked whether Caspr2 is required for the synaptic localization of IP3R1 in the cerebellum. We found no reduction of the enrichment of IP3R1 in synaptosomes prepared from Cntnap2 KO mice compared with WT littermates (Fig. 4A). Similarly, IP3R1 immunoreactivity in the cerebellum was not changed in the absence of Caspr2 (Fig. 4B). These findings suggest that Caspr2 is not acting as a scaffold to anchor IP3R1 at synapses in the cerebellum. We therefore investigated whether Caspr2 might affect IP3R1 function and downstream signaling. We found that the phosphorylation status and thus the activity of the extracellular-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) was reduced in Cntnap2 KO mice compared with WT littermates, consistent with altered intracellular signaling in the absence of Caspr2 (Fig. 4, C and D). This might be through either Ca2+-dependent or -independent modulation of ERK signaling. Based on our findings that Caspr2 controls Purkinje cell dendritic development (Fig. 2), interacts with IP3R1 (Fig. 3), and affects downstream intracellular signaling (Fig. 4, C and D), we next examined whether the interaction between Caspr2 and IP3R1 might mediate cell morphological changes. HEK293FT were used to investigate this hypothesis because the absence of endogenous Caspr2 expression alongside the very low levels of endogenous IP3R1 expression in these cells permits a clear-cut rescue experiment. Interestingly, overexpression of IP3R1 in HEK293FT cells results in the outgrowth of filopodia-like extensions (Fig. 4, E and F). Whereas overexpression of Caspr2 alone did not have an effect on cell morphology, the overexpression of Caspr2 together with IP3R1 dramatically reduced the number of IP3R1-induced extensions (Fig. 4, E and F). Of note, both Caspr2 and IP3R1 appeared to co-occur at the periphery of the cell (Fig. 4E), indicating that they communicate at the plasma membrane. Differences in Caspr2 ECD function when it is presented in cis and in trans may explain why the absence of Caspr2 from the cerebellum potentially decreases calcium levels, whereas the presence of Caspr2 in cis inhibits IP3R1-induced morphology changes. The Caspr2 Δdisc-EGF1 mutant able to interact with IP3R1 (Fig. 3H) suppressed the IP3R1-induced cellular phenotype (Fig. 4, G and H). In contrast, the Caspr2 Δfib-lam4 mutant lacking the critical IP3R1 interaction domains failed to reduce the number of IP3R1-induced extensions (Fig. 4, G and H). Together, these findings suggest that the specific interaction between Caspr2 and IP3R1 acts to inhibit IP3R1-induced changes in cell morphology. In this study, we have uncovered a function for Caspr2 in the developing cerebellum. Loss of Caspr2 impairs Purkinje cell dendritic development and results in motor coordination deficits. We have found that Caspr2 is highly enriched at synaptic specializations in the cerebellum, where it interacts with IP3R1. The specific interaction of Caspr2 with IP3R1 is mediated by the Caspr2 JXM domain, which plays a critical role in the ability of Caspr2 to inhibit IP3R1-mediated changes in cellular morphology. Collectively, our findings define a mechanism by which Caspr2 controls the development and function of the cerebellum. Members of the neurexin superfamily are thought to function as molecular platforms within the synaptic cleft, where they mediate the formation of protein complexes that control key developmental processes, including synapse organization and neural circuit formation (25Rudenko G. Neurexins: versatile molecular platforms in the synaptic cleft.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2019; 54 (30831539): 112-12110.1016/j.sbi.2019.01.009Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 26Südhof T.C.

The functions of individual neurexins are context-dependent and largely determined by structural features within their ectodomains and the expression of specific interacting proteins in distinct subsets of synapses. Our study identifies a unique function for Caspr2 in the cerebellum due to the specific interaction of the Caspr2 ECD with IP3R1, which is most highly expressed in cerebellar Purkinje cells (19Maeda N. Niinobe M. Inoue Y. Mikoshiba K. Developmental expression and intracellular location of P400 protein characteristic of Purkinje cells in the mouse cerebellum.Dev.

Notably, the Caspr2-IP3R1 interaction does not appear to regulate the synaptic localization of IP3R1 in the cerebellum but rather modulates the function of IP3R1. IP3R1 functions as a calcium channel and is critically important for normal cerebellar function. Mice lacking IP3R1 display ataxia (23Matsumoto M. Nakagawa T. Inoue T. Nagata E. Tanaka K. Takano H.

https://openalex.org/W3043677753,"We developed a stand-alone, real-time optical detection device capable of reading fluorescence intensities from cell samples with high sensitivity and precision, for use as a portable fluorescent sensor for sensing fluorescently labeled enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) Shiga toxins (Stxs). In general, the signal intensity from the fluorescently labeled Stxs was weak due to the small number of molecules bound to each cell. To address this technical challenge, we used a highly sensitive light detector (photomultiplier tube: PMT) to measure fluorescence, and designed a portable optical housing to align optical parts precisely; the housing itself was fabricated on a 3D printer. In addition, an electric circuit that amplified PMT output was designed and integrated into the system. The system shows the toxin concentration in the sample on a liquid crystal display (LCD), and a microcontroller circuit is used to read PMT output, process data, and display results. In contrast to other portable fluorescent detectors, the system works alone, without any peripheral computer or additional apparatus; its total size is about 17 × 13 × 9 cm3, and it weighs about 770 g. The detection limit was 0.01 ppm of Alexa Fluor 488 in PBS, which is ten thousand times lower than those of other smartphone-based systems and sufficiently sensitive for use with a portable optical detector. We used the portable real-time optical sensing system to detect Alexa Fluor 488–tagged Stx2B-subunits bound to monocytic THP-1 cells expressing the toxin receptor globotriaosylceramide (Gb3). The device did not detect a signal from Gb3-negative PD36 cells, indicating that it was capable of specifically detecting Stxs bound to cells expressing the toxin receptor. Following the development of a rapid and autonomous method for fluorescently tagging cells in food samples, the optical detection system described here could be used for direct detection of Shiga toxins in food in the field."
https://openalex.org/W3042833286,"Alfalfa is a forage legume commonly associated with ruminant livestock production that may be a potential source of health-promoting phytochemicals. Anecdotal evidence from producers suggests that later cuttings of alfalfa may be more beneficial to non-ruminants; however, published literature varies greatly in measured outcomes, supplement form, and cutting. The objective of this study was to measure body weight, average daily feed intake, host immunity, and the colon microbiota composition in mice fed hay, aqueous, and chloroform extracts of early (1st) and late (5th) cutting alfalfa before and after challenge with Citrobacter rodentium. Prior to inoculation, alfalfa supplementation did not have a significant impact on body weight or feed intake, but 5th cutting alfalfa was shown to improve body weight at 5- and 6-days post-infection compared to 1st cutting alfalfa (P = 0.02 and 0.01). Combined with the observation that both chloroform extracts improved mouse body weight compared to control diets in later stages of C. rodentium infection led to detailed analyses of the immune system and colon microbiota in mice fed 1st and 5th cutting chloroform extracts. Immediately following inoculation, 5th cutting chloroform extracts significantly reduced the relative abundance of C. rodentium (P = 0.02) and did not display the early lymphocyte recruitment observed in 1st cutting extract. In later timepoints, both chloroform extracts maintained lower splenic B-cell and macrophage populations while increasing the relative abundance of potentially beneficially genera such as Turicibacter (P = 0.02). At 21dpi, only 5th cutting chloroform extracts increased the relative abundance of beneficial Akkermansia compared to the control diet (P = 0.02). These results suggest that lipid soluble compounds enriched in late-cutting alfalfa modulate pathogen colonization and early immune responses to Citrobacter rodentium, contributing to protective effects on body weight."
https://openalex.org/W3043216746,"We conducted a seroprevalence study of a large ongoing outbreak of human adenovirus type 55 (HAdV-55) among the military in South Korea. Serum samples were collected between 2018 and 2019 from military-exposed (military group) and non-exposed (non-military group) populations. The plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) was used to assess neutralization activity against HAdV-55. A total of 100 sera was collected from the non-military group, of which 18.8% showed HAdV-55 neutralizing antibody activity. Ninety-six sera were tested from the military group, which had significantly higher prevalence of neutralizing antibodies (56.0%, P <0.001). A significantly higher proportion of the military group had PRNT titers ≥1:1,000 than the non-military group (85.7% vs. 50.0%, P = 0.004). Among the military group, 48.9% of active-duty soldiers had PRNT titers ≥1:5,000, while none of the discharged civilians did (P = 0.007). In conclusion, Koreans were exposed to HAdV-55 in their communities, but the exposure risk was higher among people in military service."
https://openalex.org/W3043046291,"Soft tissue sarcomas (STS) is a set of rare malignant tumor originated from mesoderm. For the prognosis of sarcoma, early diagnosis is important, however, currently no mature and non-invasive method for diagnosis exists. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of noncoding RNAs and their expression varies greatly, especially during tumor activity. The purpose of this study was to construct a predictive model for the diagnosis of sarcomas based on the relative expression level of miRNA in serum. miRNA array expression data of 677 samples including 402 malignant sarcoma samples and 275 healthy samples was used to construct the prediction model. Based on 6 gene pairs, random generalized linear model (RGLM) was constructed, with an accuracy of 100% in the internal test dataset and of 74.3% in the merged external dataset in prediction whether a serum sample was obtained from a sarcoma patient, with a specificity of 100% in the internal test dataset and 90.5% in the external dataset. In conclusion, our serum miRNA-pair classifier has the potential to be used for the screening of sarcoma with high accuracy and specificity."
https://openalex.org/W3043113337,"At our first lab meeting since the COVID-19 lockdowns were lifted, I sensed unease. After taking a seat at a large table, I noticed that no one seemed to want to sit next to me. As more people shuffled in, most of my labmates huddled on the opposite side of the table. Someone mentioned the “kung flu.” Another labmate “joked” that Asians really ought to be wearing masks, especially in small gatherings such as lab meetings. It took me a few moments to realize that—as the only Asian person in the room—they were likely talking about me. I know I should have been wearing a mask, but I wasn't the only person in the room without one.



> “Racist comments … should not be normalized and tolerated.” 

A few days before that, I was sitting in the building's atrium with a Black colleague discussing an experimental method when a scientist from another lab joined us. Upon noticing my colleague's Black Lives Matter pin, the scientist said, “You really ought to keep your politics at home.” We were both taken aback. Our visitor went on to declare that looting is not the right solution to George Floyd's killing, that people need to get jobs instead of protesting all day, and that Black people shouldn't be so angry all the time. We sat there, appalled, but didn't say anything.

On another occasion, a former co-worker asked me—as an immigrant—how I felt about President Donald Trump's immigration bans. I said I wished immigrants weren't constantly viewed as a threat to the economy because we have so much to offer, particularly in niche work sectors. The person's response was along the lines of, “At least Silicon Valley will be less of a ‘brown town’ and give others a chance.” I laughed but felt seriously uncomfortable.

Why didn't I speak up? Because I feared repercussions—and I'm sure I'm not alone in feeling that way. On the rare occasions when I have voiced my concern about racist comments, I've been told I am “too much of a social justice warrior.” I'm at a precarious point in my training, because I'm currently doing lab rotations, and I will settle on a Ph.D. adviser next year. Strained relationships with my colleagues may make it harder to find a permanent lab, or they may lead to poor letters of recommendation or lost authorship opportunities.

Yet racist comments, no matter how funny some people may think they are, should not be normalized and tolerated. I feel deeply unsettled that in the current political environment, some people—including some scientists—think it's OK to say these things. And I wish early-career scientists like me felt more comfortable questioning them.

It will take action at all rungs of scientific institutions—from deans' offices down to individual labs—to change the climate. We need more than a few hours of mandated online bias training to really mobilize a shift. Universities need to create safe spaces to discuss racial issues and microaggressions head-on—for example, by developing seminar series or journal clubs to educate the community about problems and to generate solutions. And science itself needs a culture change. We should commit to holding one another accountable for problematic behavior. When issues arise, institutions should have a clear procedure for filing grievances.

And, more broadly, there should be open and honest dialogue about the culture of intimidation and hierarchy in science. Universities and labs should seek actionable ways to flatten research team structures so that early-career scientists can feel empowered to speak up against problematic behavior.

Change is hard and takes time. Talking about racism with your colleagues is even harder. Mopping up centuries of racism that have percolated into everyday parlance will take a long time. However, science thrives when there are alternate perspectives. Now more than ever, we must acknowledge that and champion a culture of positive change."
