The cardiac lesions, in terms of their distribution and histological features, are similar to the cardiac lesions of rheumatic fever."

https://openalex.org/W1974548275,The course of infection of the avian malaria Plasmodium lophurae in the duckling is characterized by striking increase in the intraerythrocytic free amino acid pool. The quality and quantity of this change result from the presence of the parasite and for the most part reflect the free amino acid pool of the growing plasmodium. No significant changes in the free amino acids in plasma were noted during infection.

https://openalex.org/W1994383678,Abstract : Radiochemical data from fractionated samples of airburst debris are correlated logarithmically. The correlation slopes are measures of volatility. These are compared with slopes observed in the cases of high-yield surface bursts and with thermodynamic calculations of volatility.

https://openalex.org/W2000642191,"Ribosomes from heart muscle of diabetic animals perfused for 15 minutes with insulin, but without added substrate, were more active in the catalysis of protein synthesis than were ribosomes from hearts perfused without insulin. This effect of insulin on the efficiency of protein synthesis seems not to result from transport of some critical substrate into muscle, nor is the effect on ribosomes mediated by a product of a tissue other than muscle."

https://openalex.org/W2012117604,Cleavage of disulfide bonds caused by mild reduction with mercaptoethanol produces a reversible loss of cold agglutinin activity and antigen-binding ability in a gamma-A polymer cold agglutinin. Return of agglutination and antigen-binding ability occur only in those molecules that have not been depolyimerized by reduction. Loss of activity becomes irreversible if reduction is followed immediately by alkylation.

In neither case can environmental influences on the initiation of the hair cycle, such as microcirculatory changes and presence or absence of oedema, be determined satisfactorily. In the following in vivo method, single follicles may be mapped and observed repeatedly at any time-intervals thereafter."

Although this study does not eliminate active probing as a means of virus acquisition, experimentally, it clearly establishes passive contamination of aphid mouthparts as a method of virus acquisition."

https://openalex.org/W2078376531,"IN a recent paper1, Dr. B. D. Lake states that an important proportion of the enzyme activity revealed by substrate film methods may be attributed to the non-specific action of proteolytic enzymes dissolving the gelatine constituent of the film. Such a statement leaves the impression that the substrate film methods for RNase and DNase are unreliable and that results obtained so far by these methods have been erroneously interpreted."
