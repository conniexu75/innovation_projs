https://openalex.org/W3040899749,"Antibodies are a principal determinant of immunity for most RNA viruses and have promise to reduce infection or disease during major epidemics. The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has caused a global pandemic with millions of infections and hundreds of thousands of deaths to date1,2. In response, we used a rapid antibody discovery platform to isolate hundreds of human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. We stratify these mAbs into five major classes on the basis of their reactivity to subdomains of S protein as well as their cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV. Many of these mAbs inhibit infection of authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus, with most neutralizing mAbs recognizing the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S. This work defines sites of vulnerability on SARS-CoV-2 S and demonstrates the speed and robustness of advanced antibody discovery platforms. A platform for rapid antibody discovery enabled the isolation of hundreds of human monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and the prioritization of potent antibody candidates for clinical trials in patients with COVID-19."

Multi-omics clustering revealed four subgroups defined by key driver mutations, country, and gender. Proteomic and phosphoproteomic data illuminated biology downstream of copy number aberrations, somatic mutations, and fusions and identified therapeutic vulnerabilities associated with driver events involving KRAS, EGFR, and ALK. Immune subtyping revealed a complex landscape, reinforced the association of STK11 with immune-cold behavior, and underscored a potential immunosuppressive role of neutrophil degranulation. Smoking-associated LUADs showed correlation with other environmental exposure signatures and a field effect in NATs.

Lung cancers are the leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States (Siegel et al., 2019Siegel R.L. Miller K.D. Jemal A. Cancer statistics, 2019.CA Cancer J.

Clin. 2018; 68: 394-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (22180) Google Scholar). Despite therapeutic advances including tyrosine kinase inhibitors and immunotherapy, sustained responses are rare and prognosis remains poor (Herbst et al., 2018Herbst R.S. Morgensztern D. Boshoff C. The biology and management of non-small cell lung cancer.Nature. 2018; 553: 446-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar), with a 19% overall 5-year survival rate in the United States (Bray et al., 2018Bray F.

Adenocarcinoma (LUAD), the most common lung malignancy, is strongly related to tobacco smoking but also the subtype most frequently found in individuals who have reported no history of smoking (“never-smokers”) (Subramanian and Govindan, 2007Subramanian J.

Lung cancer in never smokers--a different disease.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 778-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar). The genetics and natural history of LUAD are strongly influenced by smoking status, gender, and ethnicity, among other variables (Chapman et al., 2016Chapman A.M. Sun K.Y. Ruestow P. Cowan D.M.

However, contemporary large-scale sequencing efforts have typically been based on cohorts of smokers with limited ethnic diversity. Among the major sequencing studies that have helped elucidate the genomic landscape of LUAD (Clinical Lung Cancer Genome Project (CLCGP) and Network Genomic Medicine (NGM), 2013Clinical Lung Cancer Genome Project (CLCGP)Network Genomic Medicine (NGM)A genomics-based classification of human lung tumors.Sci.

As the most frequent genomic aberrations in LUAD involve RAS/RAF/RTK pathway genes that lead to cellular transformation mainly by inducing proteomic and phosphoproteomic alterations (Cully and Downward, 2008Cully M. Downward J.

Furthermore, although prior molecular characterization has identified a number of oncologic dependencies and facilitated the development of effective inhibitors for LUAD driven by EGFR mutation (Lynch et al., 2004Lynch T.J.

To further our understanding of LUAD pathobiology and potential therapeutic vulnerabilities, the National Cancer Institute (NCI)’s Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) undertook comprehensive genomic, deep-scale proteomic, and post-translational modifications (PTM) analyses of paired (patient-matched) LUAD tumors and normal adjacent tissues (NATs). Our integrative proteogenomic analyses focused particularly on novel and clinically actionable insights revealed in the proteome and PTMs. The underlying data represent an exceptional resource for further biological, diagnostic, and drug discovery efforts. Another large-, deep-scale proteogenomics study of lung adenocarcinoma in the Taiwanese population appears in this issue (Chen et al., 2020Chen Y.-J. Roumeliotis T.I. Chang Y.-H. Chen C.-T. Han C.-L.

We investigated the proteogenomic landscape of 110 treatment-naive LUAD tumors and 101 paired NATs, prospectively collected under strict protocols limiting ischemic time. The samples represented diverse demographic and clinical characteristics including country of origin and smoking status (Figure 1A; Table S1). After confirmation of LUAD histopathology by multiple expert pathologists, aliquots of cryopulverized tissue were profiled by whole-exome sequencing (WES, nominal 150x coverage), whole-genome sequencing (WGS, nominal 15x coverage), RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), microRNA sequencing (miRNA-seq), array-based DNA methylation analysis, and in-depth proteomic, phosphoproteomic, and acetylproteomic characterization (Figures 1B and S1A; Tables S2 and S3), with complete data for 101 tumors and 96 NATs. Tandem mass tags (TMT)-based isobaric labeling was used for precise relative quantification of proteins, phosphosites, and acetylsites. Excellent reproducibility and data quality were maintained across the entire dataset (Figures S1C–S1F). Appropriate filtering resulted in a comprehensive, deepscale proteogenomic dataset allowing extensive integrative analysis (Figure 1C; Tables S2 and S3). The general landscape of somatic alterations, focal amplifications, and deletions in this study was consistent with prior large-scale profiling efforts including TCGA (Campbell et al., 2016Campbell J.D.

(J) Louvain clustering of miRNA showed parallels with NMF results but identified five clusters. miRNA cluster 2 was markedly enriched for tumors from multi-omics cluster C1, in turn aligned with proximal-inflammatory RNA signatures, while miRNA cluster 3 was enriched for the STK11 mutant subset of the NMF C3, proximal-proliferative cluster. While the remaining three miRNA clusters had mixed composition, miRNA cluster 5 was markedly enriched for ALK fusion-driven tumors, including all 5 EML4-ALK as well as the HMBOX1-ALK fusions. To investigate the intrinsic structure of the proteogenomics data, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF)-based unsupervised clustering was performed on RNA, protein, phosphosites, and acetylsites, collectively as “multi-omics clustering” and individually (except RNA) (Figures 1E and S1G–S1I). The four stable clusters (C1–4) (Figure 1E) overlapped with previously characterized mRNA-based proximal-inflammatory, proximal-proliferative, and terminal respiratory unit clusters (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2014Cancer Genome Atlas Research NetworkComprehensive molecular profiling of lung adenocarcinoma.Nature. 2014; 511: 543-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (2470) Google Scholar; Wilkerson et al., 2012Wilkerson M.D. Yin X.

The core samples of the clusters were significantly associated with distinctive clinical and molecular features (p value < 0.01; Figure 1F; Table S1). Cluster 1 (C1), aligned with proximal-inflammatory, was enriched for TP53 mutants, STK11 wild type (WT), and CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP)-high status; C2, a proximal-proliferative subcluster, was distinguished by Western patients (especially from the United States), TP53 and EGFR WT status, and intermediate CIMP status; C3, the dominant proximal-proliferative cluster, was enriched for Vietnamese patients and STK11 mutation (including two structural events identified from WGS; Table S1); and C4, aligned with terminal respiratory unit, was enriched for EGFR mutations, female sex and Chinese nationality, and was essentially devoid of KRAS or STK11 mutations. Most of the samples harboring EML4-ALK fusions were assigned to C4 and lacked mutations in other key driver genes, consistent with a primary role for EML4-ALK in LUAD tumorigenesis (Gao et al., 2018Gao Q. Liang W.-W. Foltz S.M. Mutharasu G. Jayasinghe R.G. Cao S. Liao W.-W. Reynolds S.M. Wyczalkowski M.A. Yao L. et al.Fusion Analysis Working GroupCancer Genome Atlas Research NetworkDriver Fusions and Their Implications in the Development and Treatment of Human Cancers.Cell Rep. 2018; 23: 227-238.e3Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Of note, NMF clustering based on sample purity-adjusted protein data matrices led to similar clusters compared to the unadjusted data. Although NMF clusters had distinctive biology, linear models did not identify biologically coherent sets of differential markers between sexes, tumor stages, or histological subtypes once major covariates were accounted for (Table S3). To further explore the biology associated with the multi-omics taxonomy, we performed over-representation pathway analysis (Zhang et al., 2016Zhang H. Liu T. Zhang Z. Payne S.H. Zhang B. McDermott J.E. Zhou J.-Y. Petyuk V.A. Chen L. Ray D. et al.CPTAC InvestigatorsIntegrated Proteogenomic Characterization of Human High-Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer.Cell. 2016; 166: 755-765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar) using differentially regulated genes, proteins, and post-translational modifications (PTMs) in each of the clusters (Figure 1E; Table S3). C1/proximal-inflammatory samples were primarily associated with immune signaling across multiple data types. The C2 subset of the proximal-proliferative subtype demonstrated signaling by Rho GTPases, as well as signatures of hemostasis and platelet activation, signaling, and degranulation, suggestive of systematic disturbances in coagulation homeostasis. The dominant proximal-proliferative subtype in C3 had a distinctive histone deacetylase signature but also an upregulation of cell cycle pathways. Finally, the terminal respiratory unit subtype in C4 was distinguished by surfactant metabolism, MAPK1/MAPK3 signaling, MECP2 regulation, and chromatin organization in the acetylproteome. Notably, C1, characterized by increased expression of immune system-related genes, included samples with high non-synonymous mutation burden and CIMP-high status. Altogether, the pathway enrichment analysis highlights intrinsic differences in both oncogenic signaling and host response across LUAD subtypes. To explore the pattern of miRNA expression in LUAD, we performed unsupervised Louvain clustering of 107 tumor samples with available miRNA data based on expression of mature miRNAs. Five subgroups of LUAD patients were identified by their distinctive miRNA expression profiles (Figure S1J; Table S3). Two of the miRNA clusters were markedly enriched for tumors from C1/proximal-inflammatory and C3/proximal-proliferative multi-omics clusters, whereas the remaining three miRNA clusters had mixed composition. One miRNA cluster included all five EML4-ALK as well as the HMBOX1-ALK fusion tumors and featured high expression of miR-494, miR-495, and miR-496, the first two previously implicated in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (Romano et al., 2012Romano G. Acunzo M. Garofalo M. Di Leva G. Cascione L. Zanca C. Bolon B. Condorelli G. Croce C.M. MiR-494 is regulated by ERK1/2 and modulates TRAIL-induced apoptosis in non-small-cell lung cancer through BIM down-regulation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Expression, regulation and function of miR-495 in healthy and tumor tissues.Oncol. Lett. 2017; 13: 2021-2026Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The vast majority of patients with STK11 mutations were categorized into another subgroup in which well-documented cancer-associated miRNAs such as miR-106b-5p, miR-20a-5p, and miR-17-5p were highly expressed (Lu et al., 2017Lu J.

The relationships between epigenetic and genomic events and downstream expression of RNA, proteins, and PTMs were explored in detail. Cross-referencing gene fusions in the cohort with a curated kinase fusion database (Gao et al., 2018Gao Q. Liang W.-W. Foltz S.M. Mutharasu G. Jayasinghe R.G. Cao S. Liao W.-W. Reynolds S.M. Wyczalkowski M.A. Yao L. et al.Fusion Analysis Working GroupCancer Genome Atlas Research NetworkDriver Fusions and Their Implications in the Development and Treatment of Human Cancers.Cell Rep. 2018; 23: 227-238.e3Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) allowed identification of all rearrangements involving kinases (Figure 2A). Although fusions involving ALK, ROS1, RET, and PTK2 genes were most recurrent, several novel, potentially oncogenic kinase fusions were also discovered. Generally, such oncogenic kinases contained in-frame fusions, whereas kinases with a tumor suppressive role (such as STK11, STK4, ATM, FRK, and EPHA1) exhibited disruptive out-of-frame events (Figure 2A). Several kinase fusions showed commensurate differential RNA, protein, and phosphosite expression of the index cases (Figure 2B). Besides ALK, instances of ROS1, RET, PRKDC, and PDGFRA overexpression were found in tumors but not in paired NAT samples. Investigation of the fusion architecture of the highly recurrent in-frame ALK gene fusions (n = 7) identified multiple 5′ partners including the well-established EML4 as well as novel HMBOX1 and ANKRD36B genes (Figure S2A). WGS data provided precise genomic breakpoints in the intron proximal to exon-20 (e20) underlying ALK rearrangements in five cases (Figure S2B). All ALK gene fusion cases showed outlier expression of ALK mRNA, and all in which the protein was detected (4/7) showed outlier ALK total protein abundance. However, the most dramatic difference was seen in the specific increase in ALK phosphosite Y1507 (Figure 2C). While RNA expression levels of the 5′ partner genes were uniformly high and did not differ between fusion-positive and -negative samples (Figure 2D), both EML4-Y226 and HMBOX-S141 showed increased phosphorylation only in the corresponding gene fusion-positive tumor samples (Figure 2E). We employed immunohistochemistry (IHC) to validate observation of the fusion-specific ALK phosphosite Y1507 using commercially available ALK and phospho (Y1507) ALK antibodies. We noted tumor-specific positive staining in all available ALK fusion-positive cases, whereas no detectable staining was observed in either samples with ROS1/RET fusions or paired NATs (Figures 2F and S2C). To assess phosphorylation of canonical and possible novel targets by mislocalized ALK fusion proteins (Ducray et al., 2019Ducray S.P. Natarajan K. Garland G.D. Turner S.D. Egger G. The Transcriptional Roles of ALK Fusion Proteins in Tumorigenesis.Cancers (Basel). 2019; 11: 1074Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar), we identified all protein phosphorylation events associated with ALK fusion. This analysis identified tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple proteins such as SND1, HDLBP, and ARHGEF5 (Figure 2G), providing new potential insights into oncogenic ALK fusion protein signaling, pending further validation to establish direct functional connections. SND1, for instance, has previously been described as an oncogene (Jariwala et al., 2017Jariwala N. Raja"

In order to provide an unbiased and global view of the DNA damage response in human cells, we undertook 31 CRISPR-Cas9 screens against 27 genotoxic agents in the retinal pigment epithelium-1 (RPE1) cell line. These screens identified 890 genes whose loss causes either sensitivity or resistance to DNA-damaging agents. Mining this dataset, we discovered that ERCC6L2 (which is mutated in a bone-marrow failure syndrome) codes for a canonical non-homologous end-joining pathway factor, that the RNA polymerase II component ELOF1 modulates the response to transcription-blocking agents, and that the cytotoxicity of the G-quadruplex ligand pyridostatin involves trapping topoisomerase II on DNA. This map of the DNA damage response provides a rich resource to study this fundamental cellular system and has implications for the development and use of genotoxic agents in cancer therapy."

However, the proteomic characteristics of LUAD remain poorly understood. We carried out a comprehensive proteomics analysis of 103 cases of LUAD in Chinese patients. Integrative analysis of proteome, phosphoproteome, transcriptome, and whole-exome sequencing data revealed cancer-associated characteristics, such as tumor-associated protein variants, distinct proteomics features, and clinical outcomes in patients at an early stage or with EGFR and TP53 mutations. Proteome-based stratification of LUAD revealed three subtypes (S-I, S-II, and S-III) related to different clinical and molecular features. Further, we nominated potential drug targets and validated the plasma protein level of HSP 90β as a potential prognostic biomarker for LUAD in an independent cohort. Our integrative proteomics analysis enables a more comprehensive understanding of the molecular landscape of LUAD and offers an opportunity for more precise diagnosis and treatment."

Lung cancer remains the most common malignancy and the leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide (Bray et al., 2018Bray F. Ferlay J. Soerjomataram I. Siegel R.L. Torre L.A. Jemal A.

Clin. 2018; 68: 394-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (38104) Google Scholar) and has been mainly attributed to direct tobacco exposure (Bach, 2009Bach P.B. Smoking as a Factor in Causing Lung Cancer.JAMA. 2009; 301: 539-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). However, its incidence in never-smokers remains a significant health problem globally, especially in East Asia and most predominantly among women; the non-smoking-related etiology and carcinogenesis remain poorly understood (Jemal et al., 2018Jemal A. Miller K.D. Ma J. Siegel R.L. Fedewa S.A. Islami F. Devesa S.S. Thun M.J. Higher Lung Cancer Incidence in Young Women Than Young Men in the United States.N. Engl. J.

Cancer. 2007; 7: 778-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). In Taiwanese population, never-smoker patients are predominant (53%), especially among females (93%) (Tseng et al., 2019Tseng C.H. Tsuang B.J. Chiang C.J. Ku K.C. Tseng J.S. Yang T.Y. Hsu K.H.

Additionally, early onset is a distinct feature of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) in East Asia, particularly among never-smokers (Kawaguchi et al., 2010Kawaguchi T. Matsumura A. Fukai S. Tamura A. Saito R. Zell J.A. Maruyama Y. Ziogas A. Kawahara M. Ignatius Ou S.H.

Genetic factors and exposure to environmental carcinogens may present risk factors contributing to these population differences (Samet et al., 2009Samet J.M. Avila-Tang E. Boffetta P. Hannan L.M. Olivo-Marston S. Thun M.J. Rudin C.M. Lung cancer in never smokers: clinical epidemiology and environmental risk factors.Clin. Cancer Res. 2009; 15: 5626-5645Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). For instance, in Taiwan, air pollution has been shown to correlate with the incidence of lung cancer in never-smokers (Tseng et al., 2019Tseng C.H. Tsuang B.J. Chiang C.J. Ku K.C. Tseng J.S. Yang T.Y. Hsu K.H. Chen K.C. Yu S.L. Lee W.C. et al.The Relationship Between Air Pollution and Lung Cancer in Nonsmokers in Taiwan.J. Thorac. Oncol. 2019; 14: 784-792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To complement the advances in precision therapy for advanced stage, early detection and prevention may create better clinical and economic benefits for patients and LUAD management. Thus, it is crucial to understand the early processes and progression of oncogenesis, as well as the contributing factors associated with endogenous and environmental mutagens underlying the unique characteristics of non-smoking LUAD in East Asia. Significant unmet clinical needs remain in early stage LUAD. About 20% of stage I patients still relapse after surgical resection worldwide (Sawabata et al., 2010Sawabata N. Asamura H. Goya T. Mori M. Nakanishi Y. Eguchi K. Koshiishi Y. Okumura M. Miyaoka E.

Oncol. 2010; 5: 1369-1375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). At the molecular level, EGFR activating mutations, comprising mainly L858R mutation and the E746_A750 exon 19 deletion, occur much more frequently in East Asia (>50%, especially in never-smoker females) (Yang et al., 2020Yang C.J.

Oncol. 2014; 9: 154-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). Although patients bearing EGFR mutations benefit from targeted therapies using tyrosine kinase inhibitors, most of them eventually develop resistance (Tomasello et al., 2018Tomasello C. Baldessari C. Napolitano M. Orsi G. Grizzi G. Bertolini F. Barbieri F. Cascinu S. Resistance to EGFR inhibitors in non-small cell lung cancer: Clinical management and future perspectives.Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 2018; 123: 149-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Distinctly, patients with EGFR-L858R mutation display shorter overall survival and a higher tendency to develop malignant pleural effusion and cancer metastasis compared to patients with EGFR exon 19 deletion (Kelly et al., 2018Kelly W.J. Shah N.J. Subramaniam D.S. Management of Brain Metastases in Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Mutant Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer.Front. Oncol. 2018; 8: 208Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A more comprehensive understanding of the molecular remodeling associated with oncogenic EGFR mutations in early stage will help to devise more effective therapeutic approaches. The mutational spectrum of LUAD has been extensively explored by several genomic studies, mostly representing smoking-predominant cohorts (Campbell et al., 2016Campbell J.D. Alexandrov A. Kim J.

These studies generated comprehensive catalogs of somatic mutations in Western populations and mutational subtypes associated with smoking. Multi-dimensional “omics” strategies encompassing proteome and phosphoproteome profiling of cancer tissues, in conjunction with genomic analysis, have elucidated new disease subtypes and signaling pathways, as well as potential targets for therapeutic development (Gao et al., 2019Gao Q.

Although the genomic profiles of lung cancer in Chinese patients were recently reported (Luo et al., 2018Luo W. Tian P. Wang Y. Xu H. Chen L. Tang C. Shu Y. Zhang S. Wang Z.

Huang X. et al.Comprehensive genomic and immunological characterization of Chinese non-small cell lung cancer patients.Nat. Commun. 2019; 10: 1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), a comprehensive proteogenomic profiling that can inform on the etiology and unique features of never-smoker and early onset of LUAD in East Asia is currently lacking. In this study, we performed comprehensive genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and phosphorylation analysis of patient-matched early stage LUAD tumors, the predominant type of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and normal adjacent tissues (NATs) obtained from Taiwanese patients representative of the East Asian population. This integrated proteogenomic view revealed the molecular attributes associated with early events and non-smoking-related processes in LUAD, serving as a resource to the cancer community to further delineate the underlying biology and address the unmet clinical needs. Another large, deep scale proteogenomics study of lung adenocarcinoma in a geographically diverse set of patient samples appears in this issue (Gillette et al., 2020Gillette M.A. Satpathy S. Cao S. Dhanasekaran S.M. Vasaikar S.V. Krug K. Petralia F. Li Y. Liang W.-W. Reva B. et al.Proteogenomic characterization reveals therapeutic vulnerabilities in lung adenocarcinoma.Cell. 2020; 183 (this issue): 200-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To characterize the proteogenomic landscape of lung adenocarcinoma in East Asia, whole exome sequencing (WES), RNA-seq, proteomics, and phosphoproteomics data were collected from patient-matched tumor and NAT from 103 treatment-naive patients from Taiwan. The clinicopathological characteristics of patients and tumors are summarized in Table S1A. The prospective cohort consisted of 42% male and 58% female patients, 83% non-smokers, and had a median age of 63 years. This cohort (henceforth TW) is distinct from previous lung cancer genomics studies composed of more than 70% of smokers (Campbell et al., 2016Campbell J.D. Alexandrov A. Kim J. Wala J. Berger A.H. Pedamallu C.S. Shukla S.A. Guo G. Brooks A.N. Murray B.A. et al.Distinct patterns of somatic genome alterations in lung adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas.Nat.

Sivachenko A. et al.Mapping the hallmarks of lung adenocarcinoma with massively parallel sequencing.Cell. 2012; 150: 1107-1120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar). Histologically, 89% of the tumors were adenocarcinoma, and 80% were at early stages IA and IB (Table S1B). In the adenocarcinoma group (n = 91), a total of 23,145 nonsynonymous somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs, Table S1C) were identified. At the transcriptional level, a total of 30,155 RNAs were quantified (Table S1D). Using isobaric labeling (Figure S1A), more than 10,000 unique proteins and 20,000 phosphosites were quantified (Figures S1B–S1D; Table S1E–S1G). Two reference samples from a pool of tumor and normal tissues and a pool of late stage tumors that were included in all batches showed a mean correlation of 0.88 and 0.83 for the proteome and phosphoproteome respectively, confirming high technical reproducibility (Figures S1E and S1F). Genomic profiles of genes implicated in cancer according to the Cancer Gene Census (COSMIC) are shown in Figure 1A and Table S1C. EGFR mutations occurred in most patients (85%) as expected, followed by mutations in TP53 (33%) and RBM10 (20%). The overall proportions of SNVs were different between TW and TCGA (the Cancer Genome Atlas) cohorts (p = 0.0005, Figure S1G), with cytosine to thymine (C>T) transition being the most frequent in the TW cohort (Figure 1A, bottom panel) and smoking-related cytosine to adenine (C>A) transversion being the most frequent in the TCGA cohort (Figure 1B). Non-smokers in the two cohorts showed similar proportions of C>T transitions (Table S1H). In contrast, the smoking related C>A transversions are significantly prominent in the TCGA cohort (p = 0.0053, Table S1I), especially in smokers (p < 0.0001). Most interestingly, no significant difference in C>A transversions was observed between smokers and non-smokers in the TW cohort (Table S1I). These observations suggest less significant smoking-related features, implicating other factors contributing to the genomic landscape of TW cohort. Notably, RBM10 and EGFR-L858R mutations were frequent in females, whereas KRAS and APC were often mutated in males (Fisher’s exact test, p < 0.05; Figure 1C, top panel). KRAS and ATM were prominent mutations among patients with smoking history (p < 0.01; Figure 1C, bottom panel). Notably, RBM10 mutations were more prevalent in older females (Figure 1C, middle panel) and coincided with downregulation of both RNA (p = 0.021) and protein (p = 0.036) levels, which was not significant in males (Figure S1H). The frequently mutated genes were tested for mutual exclusivity that may indicate novel synthetic lethality or distinct clonal evolution (Hua et al., 2016Hua X. Hyland P.L. Huang J. Song L. Zhu B. Caporaso N.E. Landi M.T. Chatterjee N. Shi J. MEGSA: A Powerful and Flexible Framework for Analyzing Mutual Exclusivity of Tumor Mutations.Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2016; 98: 442-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In addition to the expected mutual exclusivity between EGFR and KRAS mutations (p < 0.01) (Suda et al., 2010Suda K. Tomizawa K. Mitsudomi T. Biological and clinical significance of KRAS mutations in lung cancer: an oncogenic driver that contrasts with EGFR mutation.Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2010; 29: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), RBM10 mutations were mutually exclusive with TP53, KRAS, XIRP2, and ZNF804B mutations (p < 0.05, Figure 1D). Correlation analysis across studies using mutation frequencies from cBioPortal (Cerami et al., 2012Cerami E. Gao J. Dogrusoz U. Gross B.E. Sumer S.O. Aksoy B.A. Jacobsen A. Byrne C.J. Heuer M.L. Larsson E. et al.The cBiol. cancer genomics portal: an open platform for exploring multidimensional cancer genomics data.Cancer Discov. 2012; 2: 401-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (7663) Google Scholar) further reflects the distinct profile of our cohort (Figure 1E). The EGFR and RBM10, as well as two cell-cycle-related genes (CDC27 and RB1) have much higher mutation frequency in our cohort, whereas somatic mutations in TP53, KRAS, and KEAP1 were more prevalent in the other three studies (Figure 1F). Even comparing non-smokers in the TW and TCGA LUAD cohorts, several genes had significantly different mutation frequencies (Table S1J). For example, top-ranking genes EGFR, RBM10, and RNF213 have significantly higher frequencies (3.7- to 5.9-fold) in TW cohort, while KRAS mutation occurs more frequently (4.5-fold) in TCGA cohort. Somatic mutations on ATP2B3 and TET2 also occur more frequently in TW cohort. The results indicate differences of cancer genomes for the never-smokers between TW and TCGA LUAD. RNA-seq, proteomics, and phosphoproteomics data were integrated to devise a multi-omics taxonomy. Principal-component analysis (PCA) using row-mean scaled data (log2-transformed) showed a clear separation of the tumor and normal tissues at both the RNA and protein levels, as well as distinct clusters of the reference samples, confirming the absence of batch effects and revealing the higher variation of tumor compared to NAT (Figure 2A). The RNA-to-protein correlation using log2T/N (tumor/normal) values was moderate to low with sample-wise and gene-wise median Spearman correlations of 0.31 and 0.14, respectively (Figures 2B and 2C; Table S2A). Only 22% proteins displayed significant positive correlations with the cognate RNA (Spearman, Benj. Hoch. false discovery rate [FDR] < 0.05; Figure 2C). Enrichment analysis showed a pathway-dependent RNA-to-protein correlation, with basic cellular functions poorly corresponding to RNA (Figure 2D; Table S2B). Additionally, pathway enrichment analysis using the protein median log2T/N values across patients revealed the overall regulation trends (Figure 2E; Table S2C). Taken together, these analyses indicate transcriptionally modulated upregulation of DNA replication, glycolysis, glutathione metabolism, and immune-related pathways, while upregulation of DNA repair, protein processing and transport pathways, and downregulation of cell-adhesion-related pathways were more apparent at protein level. Focusing on the NSCLC pathway, most proteins and their phosphorylation sites were differentially regulated. Though protein expression of EGFR, ERBB2, Ras, and PKC were downregulated, many of their downstream signaling protein nodes such as JAK3, STATs, PI3K, AKT, MEK, EML4, PLCG2, and STK4 were consistently upregulated, likely mediated by phosphorylation of these kinases and known oncogenes (Figure 2F; Table S2D). The phosphorylation sites on the Raf/MEK/ERK axis displayed high inter-patient variation based on the standard deviation of the regressed phosphorylation values across patients, indicating patient-specific regulation of the MAPK pathway (Figure 2F; Table S2E). To elucidate the molecular dynamics of tumor progression, we classified patients into three groups; IA, IB, and ≥II stages; and performed differential expression analysis at both protein and RNA levels using ANOVA. Differentially expressed proteins and RNAs (p < 0.05) were further divided into two clusters by k-means clustering, and enrichment analysis of biological terms and Gene Ontology biological process (GO-BP) was performed for the clusters with progressive up- or downregulation across stages (Figures 2G and 2H). Several key processes and terms such as DNA replication, canonical glycolysis, proteasome, antibacterial humoral response, glycosyltransferase, and actin filament organization were common between the two molecular levels (Figures 2I and 2J). Proteins that function in cell-to-cell communication, signaling, and plasma membrane such as integrins, G-protein coupled receptors, ion channels, adaptive immunity, and antigen presentation presented an overall negative regulation trend during progression (Figure 2I). In contrast, proteins in glycolysis, DNA replication, stress response, and protein processing, turnover, and trafficking processes were upregulated in the later stages. The upregulation of DNA replication and repair processes, as well as the loss of cilium assembly genes, were most prominent at the RNA level (Figure 2J). Lung cancer is a very heterogeneous disease at a cellular and histological level. Thus, it is noted that tumor heterogeneity may partially contribute to these differences. Nevertheless, these results highlight the importance of multi-omics integration to identify dysregulation of molecular homeostasis during tumor progression. In summary, our results reveal a demographically distinct genomic landscape with different driver alteration frequencies. Its proteogenomic characterization shows that cellular transformation toward a more advanced cancer stage is characterized by an overall RNA-to-protein activation of replication with a parallel negative regulation of the proteome components involved in plasma membrane signaling and communication. Furthermore, the identified proteomic and RNA signatures represent the hallmarks of biological process remodeling that occurs during tumor progression. Next, we delineated the direct and indirect consequences of genomic aberrations in our cohort at the transcriptome and proteome levels. Using customized protein databases incorporating somatic mutations of individual patients, 337 mutated peptides corresponding to 319 proteins were identified (q-value < 0.01, FDR < 1%). Among these, variant isoforms of 15 cancer driver genes were identified, such as TP53BP1 D358E, RNF213 E1272Q, and D1331G, and KRAS G12C mutations in the top-ranking genes (Figure S2; Table S2F). Truncating mutations in RBM10 showed a systematic negative effect on both RNA and protein levels, whereas missense mutations in KRAS, LABM1, and PIK3CA were associated with increased protein expression only, possibly through increased stability (centered log2T/N values, t test p < 0.003; Figure 3A; Tables S3A and S3B). Elevated phosphorylation of EGFR S1064 and Y1197 has been reported in response to EGF in lung cancer cells (Zhang et al., 2015Zhang X. Belkina N. Jacob H.K. Maity T. Biswas R. Venugopalan A. Shaw P.G. Kim M.S. Chaerkady R. Pandey A. et al.Identifying novel targets of oncogenic EGF receptor signaling in lung cancer through global phosphoproteomics.Proteomics. 2015; 15: 340-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Although the impact of mutations in EGFR protein abundance was not conclusive, EGFR activating mutations (L858R and Del19) correlated with increased phosphorylation of S1064 and Y1197 (Figure 3B) (Tam et al., 2009Tam I.Y. Leung E.L. Tin V.P. Chua D.T. Sihoe A.D. Cheng L.C. Chung L.P. Wong M.P. Double EGFR mutants containing rare EGFR mutant types show reduced in vitro response to gefitinib compared with common activating missense mutations.Mol. Cancer Ther. 2009; 8: 2142-2151Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), reflecting the activation of mutated EGFR in the patients. We also performed phospho-correlation analysis using the phosphorylation log2T/N values normalized to the corresponding protein log2T/N by linear regression and filtered by Spearman’s p values. Downstream activation of the MAPK signaling can be evidenced by the positive correlation of EGFR-pY1197 with MAP2K2-pT394 (Koch et al., 2016Koch H. Wilhelm M. Ruprecht B. Beck S. Frejno M. Klaeger S. Kuster B. Phosphoproteome Profiling Reveals Molecular Mechanisms of Growth-Factor-Mediated Kinase Inhibitor Resistance in EGFR-Overexpressing Cancer Cells.J. Proteome Res. 2016; 15: 4490-4504Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), which further correlates with its substrate MAPK3-pT198/pT202 (Figure 3C), in turn with pMAPK1 and other downstream phosphoproteins (RSK2, cPLA2, and STMN1, Figure S3A). Using their median relative abundance as a signature of MAPK pathway activity, patients were ranked from high to low MAPK signaling (Figure 3D). This indicated that the MAPK signaling pathway is commonly activated among both EGFR-WT (wild-type) and mutated patients with different degrees of activation. Patients without EGFR activating mutations frequently coincided with low MAPK signaling. Three of four EGFR-WT cases with higher MAPK activity harbored KRAS mutations (Figure 3D). It is noted that low MAPK signaling was observed for most tumors with EGFR mutations that also harbor TP53 mutations (Figure 3D). Variation of MAPK pathway activity was observed within never-smokers with different EGFR activating mutations and is also influenced by TP53 mutations (Figure S3B).

Different techniques can be used to separate EV subtypes and EVs from co-isolated components, resulting in preparations of different abundance and purity."
https://openalex.org/W3041397381,"The parabrachial nucleus (PBN) is one of the major targets of spinal projection neurons and plays important roles in pain. However, the architecture of the spinoparabrachial pathway underlying its functional role in nociceptive information processing remains elusive. Here, we report that the PBN directly relays nociceptive signals from the spinal cord to the intralaminar thalamic nuclei (ILN). We demonstrate that the spinal cord connects with the PBN in a bilateral manner and that the ipsilateral spinoparabrachial pathway is critical for nocifensive behavior. We identify Tacr1-expressing neurons as the major neuronal subtype in the PBN that receives direct spinal input and show that these neurons are critical for processing nociceptive information. Furthermore, PBN neurons receiving spinal input form functional monosynaptic excitatory connections with neurons in the ILN, but not the amygdala. Together, our results delineate the neural circuit underlying nocifensive behavior, providing crucial insight into the circuit mechanism underlying nociceptive information processing."

https://openalex.org/W3041288035,"Individuals with hearing loss allocate cognitive resources to comprehend noisy speech in everyday life scenarios. Such a scenario could be when they are exposed to ongoing speech and need to sustain their attention for a rather long period of time, which requires listening effort. Two well-established physiological methods that have been found to be sensitive to identify changes in listening effort are pupillometry and electroencephalography (EEG). However, these measurements have been used mainly for momentary, evoked or episodic effort. The aim of this study was to investigate how sustained effort manifests in pupillometry and EEG, using continuous speech with varying signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Eight hearing-aid users participated in this exploratory study and performed a continuous speech-in-noise task. The speech material consisted of 30-second continuous streams that were presented from loudspeakers to the right and left side of the listener (±30° azimuth) in the presence of 4-talker background noise (+180° azimuth). The participants were instructed to attend either to the right or left speaker and ignore the other in a randomized order with two different SNR conditions: 0 dB and -5 dB (the difference between the target and the competing talker). The effects of SNR on listening effort were explored objectively using pupillometry and EEG. The results showed larger mean pupil dilation and decreased EEG alpha power in the parietal lobe during the more effortful condition. This study demonstrates that both measures are sensitive to changes in SNR during continuous speech."

Megachile sculpturalis Smith, 1853 native to Eastern-Asia, constitutes the first ever recorded wild bee species accidently introduced in Europe. Since its first discovery in 2008, M. sculpturalis has been spreading across the continent. By initiating a citizen science monitoring program, we aimed to investigate the occurrence pattern of M. sculpturalis. Within only two years after starting the project, 111 new reports from Switzerland, Liechtenstein and Austria were recorded. Comparably to other European countries, the population progressed remarkably fast from year to year expanding its area geographically but also ecologically by increasing its altitudinal range. The distribution pattern indicates human assisted jump-dispersal travelling on the major traffic routes of central Europe."

I discuss strategies at multiple systemic levels where opportunities and interventions could be implemented to enhance neuroscience workforce diversity. Neuroscience is one of the fastest growing fields and highlights the excitement about research, but it also demonstrates the impact that our large scientific community can make in prioritizing equity and inclusion throughout science. I discuss strategies at multiple systemic levels where opportunities and interventions could be implemented to enhance neuroscience workforce diversity. I write this as an African American female neuroscientist who, sadly, has too many of her own #BlackintheIvory stories to tell. I choose to work in my purpose-driven federal career every day to make a difference by enhancing neuroscience workforce diversity at every level—and hopefully reducing the number of these stories and the collateral damage they represent. As a multidisciplinary science, neuroscience is one of the fastest-growing fields for PhDs. This exponential growth highlights the excitement about research but also demonstrates the impact that our large scientific community could make in prioritizing equity and inclusion throughout the biomedical sciences. In this moment, we are called to focus as a community and confront the structural racism that has existed for too many years. What will we do with this moment? Will we rise to the challenge to bring our collective attention to dismantling structural biases and racism in the neuroscience workforce? At the National Institutes of Health (NIH)’s National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) and within the Office of Programs to Enhance Neuroscience Workforce Diversity (OPEN), my team is committed to supporting scientists from underrepresented groups through a variety of programs. We work at the individual, institutional, and community level to open opportunities and access to enhance the diversity of the neuroscience workforce. We work within our institute and across the NIH (e.g., through the NIH Blueprint to Advance Neuroscience and the BRAIN Initiative) to accomplish these goals. NINDS encourages all eligible scientists to explore and apply for these opportunities, some of which are highlighted below. The NINDS OPEN strategy for diversity and inclusion is to (1) identify diverse pools of students along the training pathway to recruit and prepare trainees, (2) provide resources for retaining diverse scientists and eliminating barriers for career transition, (3) develop meaningful mentorship and connect individuals to supportive scientific and professional development networks, and (4) develop policies and resources to enhance diversity in neuroscience. These diversity programs often provide more than just financial support and are an opportunity to create meaningful networks and supportive communities. It is important to note that these programs support meritorious and competitive awards that fulfill a mission-critical need for NIH. Programs that encourage diversity employ the same logic as NIH mechanisms that specifically solicit clinician researchers, translational investigators, and scientists with quantitative backgrounds. The programs are created to attract and support talented scientists who have historically faced systemic barriers leading to their underrepresentation in the biomedical sciences and whose participation in biomedical workforce will enhance innovation and creativity, problem solving, decision making, and many other aspects of science. Hopefully, the resources and funding opportunities offered by NINDS will facilitate a small part of the solution for diversity and inclusion that enhances neuroscience workforce diversity. As a funder, we can contribute to and support the change, but we alone cannot make an impact. The Research Supplements to Promote Diversity provide administrative supplements to existing NIH research grants (R-, P-, U-, etc.) to support the work of underrepresented scientists—from the level of high school students through early career faculty. Supplements provide funding for the mentee to gain research experience, preliminary data, and/or other requirements to develop an application for further training or more traditional NIH funding opportunities. Our graduate and postdoc supplementees have better than average success rates for subsequent awards, like the F31, F32, and K awards. An overwhelming majority of NINDS-supported diverse trainees stay in the general biomedical workforce after training (94%). The majority of former supplement trainees who have received their doctoral degree and have finished postgraduate training remain in either academic research or teaching (43%) or science-related non-research (40%). On the institutional side, NINDS supports budding neuroscientists through the Research Education R25 mechanism. Our Summer Research Experience Programs, which are designed to help attract young students to careers in science, provide underrepresented high school or college students with authentic research experiences during summer breaks and provide opportunities for college students to gain valuable experience in preparation for graduate school. The ENDURE Program, another R25 program that is run through the NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience, engages undergraduates from underrepresented groups in a 2-year neuroscience research program during the academic and summer months, starting in sophomore or junior year. Six awards encompass 40 neuroscience partner institutions, including host institutions, T32 partners, summer placement institutions, and external advisors. Each student averages 1,700 research hours upon completion of the program, and currently 60% of alumni are enrolled in post-graduate programs. At each point on the academic ladder, the research workforce becomes less diverse (Meyers et al., 2018Meyers L.C. Brown A.M. Moneta-Koehler L. Chalkley R. Survey of checkpoints along the pathway to diverse biomedical research faculty.PLoS ONE. 2018; 13: e0190606Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar; Gibbs et al., 2016Gibbs K.D. Basson J. Xierali I.M. Broniatowski D.A. Decoupling of the minority PhD talent pool and assistant professor hiring in medical school basic science departments in the US.eLife. 2016; 5: e21393Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). NINDS recognizes that career transitions are a natural time for reevaluation and that many trainees encounter barriers to advancing in academia at these critical times. NINDS facilitates career transitions for individual researchers through the NIH Blueprint D-SPAN F99/K00 program and Mentored Career Development Awards (K awards). These awards provide protected time, mentorship, and resources to navigate the graduate school to postdoc, postdoc to faculty, and tenure track to tenure transitions. In all these awards, mentors must help researchers to navigate institutional expectations, scientific networks, and practices that are relevant to productivity and advancement at the institution. The NIH Blueprint D-SPAN F99/K00 Award supports graduate students from across neuroscience with 1–2 years of funding to complete their PhD and 4 years of funding to take anywhere in the United States for their postdoctoral training. Although a relatively new program, it supports 59 scholars, 22 of whom have already transitioned to the postdoctoral level. At the next career stage, the NINDS Diversity K22 Advanced Postdoctoral Career Transition Award has two phases: (1) an initial mentored postdoctoral training period for 2–3 years to facilitate the development of independence and (2) support during the early stages of a faculty position. The goal is to diversify the pool of independent neuroscience research investigators and to enhance their probability of success in obtaining independent research support from NIH or elsewhere. Finally, the NINDS Diversity K01 Faculty Development Award provides tenure-track junior faculty protected time (up to 5 years) and resources for exploring innovative ideas, collecting preliminary data, and successfully attracting external research funds with the goal of receiving tenure. NINDS K awardees have been markedly successful in competing for subsequent R01s and establishing their independent research programs. NINDS recognizes that no trainee can thrive in isolation. As pointed out in the National Academy of Sciences 2011 Report on Expanding Underrepresented Minority Participation, “even if trainees are prepared, have adequate information, and are ambitious and talented enough to succeed in STEM fields, success may also hinge on the extent to which students feel socially and intellectually integrated.” To that end, NINDS funds national programs targeted to mentorship, professional development, and the creation of networks/cohorts through the R25 mechanism. Two of these programs are managed by scientific societies (Society for Neuroscience and the American Academy of Neurology), while others (e.g., BRAINS, MINDS, and COMRADE) focus on the specific needs of postdocs and/or faculty across the United States. The longest running of these programs, SfN’s Neuroscience Scholars Program, has supported more than 700 diverse trainees over three decades. An emphasis on mentorship and networking are also built into all of our programs; for example, D-SPAN and ENDURE scholars convene at annual meetings, while principal investigators (PIs) of our R25 programs convene with T32 PIs at regular meetings to build alliances with individuals who are actively engaged in addressing issues concerning workforce diversity and individuals engaged in neuroscience training. With the understanding that disparities are not just the result of individual actions, but primarily result from unjust policies, procedures, and systems, NINDS has also embarked on several initiatives to examine our existing systems to ensure that our decision making is fair and inclusive. Many of these initiatives stem from the NINDS Diversity Workgroup, in which staff from across the institute meet to discuss these issues and take action. We have developed resources: webinars, program-specific tip sheets, and a podcast, Building Up the Nerve, to assist applicants in navigating what can be viewed as a confusing and daunting process with regards to grant application submission. As outlined in a recent Director’s Message by Dr. Walter Koroshetz, NINDS is also taking time to address racial bias in our own house and to address the consequences of racial bias on the science we fund. We are currently in the midst of a strategic planning process and would encourage comments regarding the topic of enhancing neuroscience workforce diversity. As a scientific community, we can agree to move this conversation from “where is the diverse talent—does it exist?” to a focus on the ways that diversity helps solve many of the tough research questions within neuroscience. Research shows that diverse teams working together and capitalizing on innovative ideas and distinct perspectives outperform homogeneous teams (Antonio et al., 2004Antonio A.L. Chang M.J. Hakuta K. Kenny D.A. Levin S. Milem J.F. Effects of racial diversity on complex thinking in college students.Psychol. Sci. 2004; 15: 507-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar; Campbell et al., 2013Campbell L.G. Mehtani S. Dozier M.E. Rinehart J. Gender-heterogeneous working groups produce higher quality science.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8: e79147Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar; Hong and Page, 2004Hong L. Page S.E. Groups of diverse problem solvers can outperform groups of high-ability problem solvers.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 16385-16389Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar). Scientists and trainees from diverse backgrounds and with diverse life experiences bring different perspectives, creativity, and individual enterprise to address complex scientific problems. A diverse NIH-supported scientific workforce fosters scientific innovation (Hofstra et al., 2020Hofstra B. Kulkarni V.V. Munoz-Najar Galvez S. He B. Jurafsky D. McFarland D.A. The Diversity-Innovation Paradox in Science.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2020; 117: 9284-9291Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), enhances global competitiveness, contributes to robust learning environments, improves the quality of the research, advances the likelihood that underserved populations participate in and benefit from health research, and enhances public trust. Diversity and scientific excellence are not two separate concepts. We must enlist all the brightest minds and talents within our diverse research community and remove all barriers to advancement. However, increasing diversity alone is not sufficient. We must create inclusive environments that welcome and value everyone’s contributions. I often quote Vernã Myers, “Diversity is being invited to the party; inclusion is being asked to dance.” There is a shared responsibility between NIH and the institutions that we fund. At the institutional level, senior leadership sets the tone. What gets measured gets done, and what gets rewarded gets repeated. Institutions must measure institutional climate and promote cultural awareness. It is necessary to attend to the intersectionality of race, ethnicity, disability status, sexual orientation, gender identity, and other marginalized identities (for example, panels for issues concerning women should not be made up only of white women). The diversity goals at the institutional level should be explicit and foster development of strategies to achieve those goals. When we think about diversity, we often focus on the impact on the individual. However, we should not lose sight of what diversity means to the larger lab, university, or research environment. Institutions must develop strategies to address unearned advantages and disadvantages. As we deal with the COVID-19 pandemic and conversations regarding developing immunity to the virus, this makes me think in parallel about resistance or an immunity to change itself and what it takes to change the structural racism that clearly exists in the science and biomedical enterprise (Cell Editorial Team, 2020Cell Editorial TeamScience Has a Racism Problem.Cell. 2020; 181: 1443-1444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Personal change is undeniably intertwined with organizational change. According to Robert Kegan and Lisa Laskow Lahey, resistance to change is a “hidden commitment” created by individual beliefs and collective organizational mindsets, with an underlying root cause, that competes and conflicts with a stated commitment to change (Kegan and Lahey, 2009Kegan R. Lahey L. Immunity to Change: How to Overcome It and Unlock Potential in Yourself and Your Organization. Harvard Business Press, 2009Google Scholar). “Immunity to Change” is a framework that tracks goals and focuses on overcoming perceived barriers and outlines productive actions to combat the forces of inertia. This framework could be useful as we transition from supportive statements to concrete action plans. Below is a summary of this leadership tool:Step 1: A Commitment to Change. Get goal oriented and identify actions to achieve the goal.Step 2: Behavior. What are you doing or not doing to support that commitment? How do we clear out obstructive behaviors?Step 3: Hidden Competing Commitment. What is the hidden competing commitment? How do we confront competing commitments?Step 4: Big Assumption. What is the underlying belief that underpins the hidden competing commitment, and how do you challenge assumptions? At the individual level, we must work to ensure that we acknowledge the thoughts, feelings, perspectives, and ideas of our peers, especially those who are underrepresented. The data from several studies show that scientists from underrepresented groups typically receive less mentoring than their well-represented peers, and this can promote career attrition or limit career advancement. Each of us, individually, must practice meaningful mentorship and sponsorship. Sponsors connect mentees to “power” through award nominations and membership in professional networks. As scientists, we solve tough, complex research questions every day—confronting structural racism and increasing diversity in the workforce should not be treated as “just too hard.” As neuroscientists, we work to understand the power and wonder of the brain—it is time we use these brains to create long-lasting structural change. As funders, scientific communities, institutions, and individuals, we are the change we seek. And as William and Susan Bridges wrote in 1981, “It isn’t the changes that do you in, it’s the transitions. Change is situational, transition is the psychological process people go through to come to terms with the new situation. Change is external, transition is internal” (Bridges and Bridges, 1981Bridges W. Bridges S. Managing Transitions. Da Capo Lifelong Books, 1981Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W3042099685,"Abstract Wnt/β-catenin signaling is one of the key cascades regulating embryogenesis and tissue homeostasis; it has also been intimately associated with carcinogenesis. This pathway is deregulated in several tumors, including colorectal cancer, breast cancer, and desmoid tumors. It has been shown that CTNNB1 exon 3 mutations are associated with an aggressive phenotype in several of these tumor types and may be associated with therapeutic tolerance. Desmoid tumors typically have a stable genome with β-catenin mutations as a main feature, making these tumors an ideal model to study the changes associated with different types of β-catenin mutations. Here, we show that the apoptosis mechanism is deregulated in β-catenin S45F mutants, resulting in decreased induction of apoptosis in these cells. Our findings also demonstrate that RUNX3 plays a pivotal role in the inhibition of apoptosis found in the β-catenin S45F mutants. Restoration of RUNX3 overcomes this inhibition in the S45F mutants, highlighting it as a potential therapeutic target for malignancies harboring this specific CTNNB1 mutation. While the regulatory effect of RUNX3 in β-catenin is already known, our results suggest the possibility of a feedback loop involving these two genes, with the CTNNB1 S45F mutation downregulating expression of RUNX3 , thus providing additional possible novel therapeutic targets for tumors having deregulated Wnt/β-catenin signaling induced by this mutation."

However, little is known about the culturable bacterial diversity thrive in hypersaline lakes. In this work, a total of 343 bacteria from sediment samples of Aiding Lake, China, were isolated using nine different media supplemented with 5% or 15% (w/v) NaCl. The number of species and genera of bacteria recovered from the different media varied, indicating the need to optimize the isolation conditions. The results showed an unexpected level of bacterial diversity, with four phyla (Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Rhodothermaeota), fourteen orders (Actinopolysporales, Alteromonadales, Bacillales, Balneolales, Chromatiales, Glycomycetales, Jiangellales, Micrococcales, Micromonosporales, Oceanospirillales, Pseudonocardiales, Rhizobiales, Streptomycetales, and Streptosporangiales), including 17 families, 43 genera (including two novel genera), and 71 species (including four novel species). The predominant phyla included Actinobacteria and Firmicutes and the predominant genera included Actinopolyspora, Gracilibacillus, Halomonas, Nocardiopsis, and Streptomyces.

https://openalex.org/W3041546689,"Exosomes appear to be effective inter-cellular communicators delivering several types of molecules, such as proteins and RNAs, suggesting that they could influence neural stem cell (NSC) differentiation. Our RNA sequencing studies demonstrated that the RNAs related to cell proliferation and astrocyte differentiation were upregulated in human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) when co-cultured with exosomes obtained from the culture medium of human glioma cells (U87). Metallothionein 3 and elastin genes, which are related to cell proliferation, increased 10 and 7.2 fold, respectively. Expression of genes for astrocyte differentiation, such as tumor growth factor alpha, induced protein 3 of the NOTCH1 family, colony stimulating factor and interleukin 6 of the STAT3 family and Hes family bHLH transcription factor 1 also increased by 2.3, 10, 4.7 and 2.9 fold, respectively. We further examined the effects of these exosomes on rat fetal neural stem cell (rNSC) differentiation using the secreted exosomes from U87 glioma cells or exosomes from U87 cells that were stimulated with interleukin 1β (IL-1β). The rNSCs, extracted from rat brains at embryonic day 14 (E14), underwent a culture protocol that normally leads to predominant (~90%) differentiation to ODCs. However, in the presence of the exosomes from untreated or IL-1β-treated U87 cells, significantly more cells differentiated into astrocytes, especially in the presence of exosomes obtained from the IL-1β-challenged glioma cells. Moreover, glioma-derived exosomes appeared to inhibit rNSC differentiation into ODCs or astrocytes as indicated by a significantly increased population of unlabeled cells. A portion of the resulting astrocytes co-expressed both CD133 and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) suggesting that exosomes from U87 cells could promote astrocytic differentiation of NSCs with features expected from a transformed cell. Our data clearly demonstrated that exosomes secreted by human glioma cells provide a strong driving force for rat neural stem cells to differentiate into astrocytes, uncovering potential pathways and therapeutic targets that might control this aggressive tumor type."
https://openalex.org/W3041946132,"The chaperone heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) is crucial for avoiding protein misfolding under stress, but is also up-regulated in many kinds of cancers, where its ability to buffer cellular stress prevents apoptosis. Previous research has suggested Hsp70 interacts with pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, including Bim and Bax. However, a definitive demonstration of this interaction awaits, and insights into the structural basis and molecular mechanism remain unclear. Earlier studies have identified a Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3) domain present in Bcl-2 family members that engages receptors to stimulate apoptosis. We now show that Hsp70 physically interacts with pro-apoptotic multidomain and BH3-only proteins via a BH3 domain, thereby serving as a novel BH3 receptor, using in vitro fluorescent polarization (FP), isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), and cell-based co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments, 1H-15N-transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy (TROSY-HSQC), trypsin proteolysis, ATPase activity, and denatured rhodanese aggregation measurements further demonstrated that BimBH3 binds to a novel allosteric site in the nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) of Hsp70, by which Bim acts as a positive co-chaperone to promote the ATPase activity and chaperone functions. A dual role of Hsp70's anti-apoptotic function was revealed that when it keeps Bim in check to inhibit apoptosis, it simultaneously stabilizes oncogenic clients including AKT and Raf-1 with the aid of Bim.

The chaperone function of Hsp70 is based on an allosteric mechanism, in which nucleotide-binding and conformation-specific co-chaperones regulate Hsp70-client protein interaction.

The biological consequence of these complexes is unknown. The protein-protein interactions (PPIs) of the Bcl-2 family proteins dictate apoptosis, which is mediated by a Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3) domain of the pro-apoptotic protein that inserts into a BH3 receptor groove on the surface of anti-apoptotic proteins (12Kelekar A.

Bcl-2-family proteins: the role of the BH3 domain in apoptosis.Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8 (9704409): 324-33010.1016/S0962-8924(98)01321-XAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Recent pieces of evidence have revealed that BH3-only proteins could engage into BH3-receptor proteins besides the 16 well-known Bcl-2 family proteins (13Szlyk B. Braun C.R. Ljubicic S. Patton E.

In this study, Bim was revealed that binds Hsp70 in vitro and in cells through the BH3 domain (a diagram of Bim sequence is shown in Fig. S1). Bim acts as a positive co-chaperone of Hsp70 because it increased ATPase activity and oncogenic chaperone functions of Hsp70 by stabilizing its ADP-binding conformation. In opposite to its classic role as an activator of intrinsic apoptosis, Bim was revealed that could help Hsp70 to stabilize oncogenic clients AKT and Raf-1. We characterized the binding ability of Hsp70 proteins to BH3 domains of Bid, Bim, Noxa, Bax, and Bak by using in vitro biochemical assays and cell-based assays. Two Hsp70 inhibitors (VER-155008 (16Wen W. Liu W.X. Shao Y.F. Chen L. VER-155008, a small molecule inhibitor of HSP70 with potent anti-cancer activity on lung cancer cell lines.Exp. Biol.

Lett. 2013; 4: 1042-104710.1021/ml400204nCrossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar)) were tested in parallel. First, the specific binding effects of these BH3 peptides on apo-Hsp70 (nucleotide-free Hsp70) were evaluated through FP. As shown in Fig. S2, BH3 peptides derived from Bid, Bim, Noxa, Bax, and Bak exhibited direct binding affinities (Kd = 1.3-1.5 μm) to apo-Hsp70. MKT-077 could effectively compete the binding of BimBH3 to Hsp70 (IC50 = 3.2 μm), whereas VER-155008 failed to dissociate the BimBH3/Hsp70 complex (IC50 >100 μm). When mutating conserved BimBH3 resides Leu-62 and Asp-67 to alanine, it reduced the binding of BimBH3 to Hsp70 below detectable levels in our assay (Kd > 100 μm). FP results illustrated that the direct interactions of Bcl-2 family proteins with Hsp70 might be mediated by the BH3 domains, where MKT-077 but not VER-155008 might also occupy. Next, we explored whether Hsp70 could bind Bcl-2 members through the BH3 domain in cells. Co-IP experiments were performed in BV173 and KCL22 cells to detect multidomain pro-apoptotic members and BH3-only pro-apoptotic members complexed with Hsp70. As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, the binding profiles of Hsp70 were found to be different in the two cell lines. Only Bim was observed at certain levels in complex with Hsp70 in both cell lines, whereas Bax and Bak were found to form heterodimers with Hsp70 only in KCL22 cells, suggesting the cell context-dependent Hsp70 complex with Bcl-2 proteins. No interactions were found between other BH3-only proteins (Bad, Puma, Noxa, and Bid) with Hsp70 in either of BV173 and KCL22. We further expanded the cell lines to His-23 and Lys-562, and continuously observed Bim interactions with Hsp70, whereas interactions with other BH3-only proteins were not found. Additionally, we detected some Hsp70/Bak complex but little Hsp70/Bax complex in Lys-562 and His-23 (Fig. S3). Then, we performed competitive experiments. As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, BimBH3 peptide efficiently disrupted the Hsp70/Bim interaction, indicating that Bim interacts with Hsp70 via BH3 domain in cells. The control BimBH3L62A/D67A peptide was ineffective. In addition, the Hsp70/Bim complex was potently disrupted by MKT-077, whereas weak to no disruption was found for VER-155008 (Fig. 1A), which is consistent with the in vitro binding profile. Of note, the level of Bim remained constant for 2–24 h after it was released by 5 μm MKT-077, and it did not show any dose-dependent change with exposure to up to 10 μm compound (Fig. 1C). Hsp70-interacting protein can be divided into two groups: clients and co-chaperones. When the ATPase activity of Hsp70 is inhibited by inhibitors, for example, MKT-077, the client protein level would decrease (18Budina-Kolomets A. Balaburski G.M. Bondar A. Beeharry N. Yen T. Murphy M.E. Comparison of the activity of three different HSP70 inhibitors on apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, autophagy inhibition, and HSP90 inhibition.Cancer Biol. Ther. 2014; 15 (24100579): 194-19910.4161/cbt.26720Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The unchanged Bim level after MKT-077 treatment indicated that Bim is likely to be a co-chaperone of Hsp70 rather than a client. Additionally, BimBH3 peptide binds to Hsp70 at higher binding affinity (Kd values at the submicromolar range) than the affinities of the reported client proteins (typically low to mid-micromolar) (19Cesa L.C. Shao H. Srinivasan S.R. Tse E. Jain C. Zuiderweg E.R.P. Southworth D.R. Mapp A.K. Gestwicki J.E. X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) is a client of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) and a biomarker of its inhibition.J. Biol.

To explore the biological relevance of Bcl-2 family proteins with Hsp70 from a bioinformatics perspective, we examined publically available the CCLE database for gene expression data and determined association of Bcl-2 family protein expression with Hsp70 expression. Associations were examined in the pan-cancer (n = 837 across 16 cancers) (Table S1). As shown in Fig. 1D and Fig. S4, there is a significant correlation between Bim and Hsp70 expression (r = 0.36, p = 10−20, 95% confidence interval of (0.31, 0.41)) (20Cohen J. Statistical power analysis for the behavioral sciences. 2nd Ed. L. Erlbaum Associates, Hillsdale, NJ1988Google Scholar). Compared with Bim, there were nonsignificant positive associations between other pro-apoptotic BH3-only and multidomain Bcl-2 family members with Hsp70. The bioinformatics analysis highlights a related biological function between Hsp70 and Bim. Thus, we focus on Hsp70/Bim complex in the following study. To identify the interaction site for Bim on Hsp70, we expressed the recombination NBD (residues 1-383) and SBD (residues 397-506) of Hsp70, and analyzed the interaction of Bim with different nucleotide-bound states of Hsp70 by isothermal titration calorimeter (ITC). As shown in Fig. 2A, BimLΔC27 had a 6-fold higher binding affinity for ADP-bound full-length Hsp70 (Kd = 0.89 μm) (Fig. 2A, left panel) relative to ATP-bound Hsp70 (Kd = 5.3 μm) (Fig. 2A, right panel). Furthermore, we measured that BimLΔC27 exhibited essentially similar binding preference and affinity for ADP-bound Hsp70 NBD domain (Kd = 1.0 μm) relative to ATP-bound Hsp70 NBD (Kd = 6.4 μm) (Fig. 2B, left and right panels), whereas the interactions of the SBD domain appeared to be significantly weaker (Kd = 10.2 μm) (Fig. 2C). Although BimBH3 binds both NBD and SBD, no second binding event was apparent in the ITC curve of BimB3 to full-length Hsp70, suggesting that a close contact of NBD and SBD in full-length Hsp70 might form one binding unit for Bim, as similar as previously found in the Hsp70/Hsp40 complex (21Weyer F.A. Gumiero A. Gesé G.V. Lapouge K. Sinning I. Structural insights into a unique Hsp70-Hsp40 interaction in the eukaryotic ribosome-associated complex.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2017; 24 (28067917): 144-15110.1038/nsmb.3349Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The significantly higher binding affinity of Bim to NBD than SBD showed that BimBH3 mainly interacts with Hsp70 NBD in an ADP-bound state and complements SBD by weak interactions.Figure 2The binding site and conformational change effect of Bim in Hsp70 as determined by ITC, 1H-15N-TROSY NMR spectrum, and limited trypsin proteolysis.

The levels of significance were evaluated by two-tailed t test (**, p < 0.01).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To test whether BimBH3 resembles that full-length Bim, we assayed the binding affinity of BimBH3. As shown in Fig. S5, BimBH3 interacted with ADP-bound full-length Hsp70 (Kd = 0.81 μm), ADP-bound Hsp70 NBD (Kd = 0.94 μm), and Hsp70 SBD domain (Kd = 9.3 μm) as similar as BimLΔC27 did. Thus, it can be concluded that Bim interacts with the Hsp70 NBD domain via the BH3 domain. Consequently, we performed 1H-15N-transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy (TROSY) NMR experiments to explore the binding site of Bim on Hsp70 NBD domain. FP experiments showed that Hsc70 NBD binds BimBH3 as similar as Hsp70 NBD did (Fig. S6), which is consistent with the high similarity in Hsp70 and Hsc70. Because assignments of the backbone resonances of the Hsc70 NBD domain have been available in literature (22Zuiderweg E.R.P. Gestwicki J.E. Backbone and methyl resonance assignments of the 42 kDa human Hsc70 nucleotide binding domain in the ADP state.Biomol. NMR Assign. 2017; 11 (27699616): 11-1510.1007/s12104-016-9711-xCrossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), we used a spectrum of 15N-labeled Hsc70 NBD to localize the binding site (Fig. 2D). The resonance of 6 residues (Arg-72, Val-146, Thr-177, His-227, Thr-298, and Arg-342) showed a significant decrease in peak intensity (PI1/PI2 > 2), and 36 residues showed significant chemical shift changes (>0.02 ppm, Fig. 2E). All the residues showing significant peak intensity decrease (shown in red sticks) and more than 70% of the residues showing significant chemical changes (shown in red) were located in subdomains IA and IIA, surrounding a cleft opposite to the nucleotide-binding pocket, and therefore this cleft is indicated as the binding site of BimBH3 (Fig. 2F, red circle). To validate the binding site, we mutated His-227, one of the most disturbed residues in NMR experiment, and assayed the influence on Bim binding. By FP-based binding assay, we detected that compared with WT Hsp70 protein, the H227A mutant resulted in a 5-fold loss of binding affinity (Fig. S7), confirming the localization of the interaction site of Bim on Hsp70. Compared with MKT-077 and J-domain (Fig. 2F, binding sites were labeled in green and blue circles, respectively), BimBH3 binds into a site distinct from either of them. There is a region involved in both MKT-077 and BimBH3-binding areas, indicative of mutually exclusive binding. It is consistent with the competitive effect of MKT-077 against BimBH3 in FP and co-IP assays. The NMR results indicated that BimBH3 engaged in a site that is different from the previously known sites occupied by the J-domain or MKT-077. To test it, we performed FP-based binding between BimBH3 and Hsp70 in the presence or absence of the J-domain, and observed that the J-domain cannot influence the interaction between BimBH3 and Hsp70 (Fig. S7). The result confirmed that the binding site of Bim is different from J-domain. Interacting proteins or small molecules that bind on the Hsp70 NBD domain often induce a conformational change between the ADP-like and ATP-like states. To evaluate whether Bim has such an effect, we performed trypsin treatment of human Hsp70. Consistent with previous reports (23Chang L. Miyata Y. Ung P.M.U. Bertelsen E.B. McQuade T.J. Carlson H.A. Zuiderweg E.R.P. Gestwicki J.E. Chemical screens against a reconstituted multiprotein complex: myricetin blocks DnaJ regulation of DnaK through an allosteric mechanism.Chem. Biol. 2011; 18 (21338918): 210-22110.1016/j.chembiol.2010.12.010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), the addition of either ATP or ADP decelerated the proteolysis (Fig. 2G). Hsp70 saturated with ATP was primarily cleaved into three high-molecular mass bands, including prominent bands at ∼58 kDa (band 1) and 55 kDa (band 2). Conversely, treatment with ADP strongly favored band 2. Addition of J domain, which stimulates ATP turnover in Hsp70, converted the ATP-like pattern into an ADP-like pattern, as shown by a significantly decreased ratio of band 1/band 2 than that in ATP-like state (**, p < 0.01, Fig. 2G, bottom panel). Addition of BimBH3 to Hsp70 significantly favored band 2, which is similar to the influence of ADP and J domain. These results indicated that Bim binds preferentially to the ADP-bound state of Hsp70. The newly identified Bim-binding site is a novel allosteric site by which the ADP-bound conformation of Hsp70 could be stabilized. So far, the solid evidence of Bim binding with Hsp70 to act as an allosteric regulator has been shown, which prompted us to evaluate the effect of BimBH3 on ATPase and chaperone activities of Hsp70. We first evaluated the effect of Bim on Hsp70 ATPase. As shown in Fig. 3A, the combination of Hsp70 (1 μm) and BimBH3 (0.1 μm), which resembled the ratio of Bim-bound Hsp70 in total Hsp70 as determined by semi-quantification assay in cells (Fig. S8) resulted in a 3.8-fold increase of the rate of ATP consumption similarly to the addition of J domain (4.2-fold), and both of their stimulations of ATPase activity were blunted by MKT-077. The control BimBH3L62A/D67A peptide was ineffective. We also compared BimBH3 with σ32, a model Hsp70's client. As shown in Fig. S9, A and B, BimBH3 could stimulate the ATPase activity of the Hsp70 NBD domain by 3.5-fold, which is similar to that of full-length Hsp70 (3.8-fold). In contrast, σ32 only stimulated full-length Hsp70 (2.2-fold) but not Hsp70 NBD. Compared with BimBH3 or J domain alone (3.6- and 4-fold, respectively), σ32 combination with BimBH3 or J domain stimulated ATP hydrolysis by 7.5- and 8.3-fold, respectively, suggesting that the combination could synergize to stimulate ATPase of Hsp70. However, the effect is abolished when using the Hsp70 NBD domain (Fig. S9B), suggesting that SBD is required for the synergistic effect. Next, we measured the aggregation of denatured rhodanese by spectrophotometry to assess the effect of BimBH3 on Hsp70 chaperon activity. As shown in Fig. 3B, the addition of either BimBH3 or J domain in Hsp70 reduced rhodanese aggregation by 40–50%, indicative of the positive effect of BimBH3 on facilitating Hsp70 to bind and stabilize denatured rhodanese. MKT-077 inhibited these positive regulations of Hsp70 (Fig. 3B). Consistent with decreased Bim binding by the H227A mutant, the effect of BimBH3 on Hsp70 ATPase and aggregation of denatured rhodanese was significantly impaired by the mutant, whereas it did not influence the effect of J domain (Fig. 3, A and B). In agreement with BimBH3 peptide, we detected similar positive effects of BimLΔC27 on Hsp70 chaperon activity (Fig. S10). These results identified that Bim acts as a positive co-chaperone of the Hsp70 chaperone cycle. To evaluate whether the in vitro biochemical assay represented the positive co-chaperone function of Bim in living cells, BV173 and KCL22 cells were transfected with Bim shRNA. As shown in Fig. S11, Bim shRNA transfection down-regulated the Bim protein level by about 90%, whereas Bim silence did not affect the level and complex state of Hsp70, Hsp40, and BAG3. Then, we immunoprecipitated Hsp70 from cell lysates of WT and Bim-silenced cells, respectively, and performed ATPase assays. As shown by Fig. 3C, Bim silence led to a down-regulation of the ATPase activity of Hsp70 by 30–40% in both BV173 and KCL22 cells, confirming the positive co-chaperone role of Bim in stimulating Hsp70 ATPase in cells. Hsp70 is an important cancer chaperone that assists in the correct folding of oncogenic client proteins. The tumor addiction of Hsp70 may be enhanced by Bim because positive co-chaperones could up-regulate the level of clients and most reported so far are prosurvival proteins (24Calderwood S.K. Molecular cochaperones: tumor growth and cancer treatment.Scientifica (Cairo). 2013; 2013 (24278769): 21751310.1155/2013/217513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We then evaluated regulation of the Hsp70/Bim complex on AKT and Raf-1, which are well-established clients of Hsp70 and are two important signaling proteins that control growth and anti-apoptosis of cancer cells (25Pratt W.B. Morishima Y. Peng H.M. Osawa Y. Proposal for a role of the Hsp90/Hsp70-based chaperone machinery in making triage decisions when proteins undergo oxidative and toxic damage.Exp. Biol. Med. 2010; 235 (20404045): 278-28910.1258/ebm.2009.009250Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). To test if Bim is involved in the control of these clients, we investigated whether Bim silence in BV173 affects levels of AKT and Raf-1. As shown in Fig. 3D, Bim silence caused a decreased level of AKT and Raf-1 by 38 and 35%, respectively, and Hsp70 silence caused a decreased level of AKT and Raf-1 by 44 and 42%, respectively. However, in cells with stable Hsp70 knockdown, Bim shRNA transient transfection had little effect on the levels of AKT and Raf-1 (p > 0.05, Fig. 3D). Therefore, the Hsp70/Bim complex is critical for stabilization of AKT and Raf-1. Similar effects of Hsp70 and Bim knockdown were detected in KCL22 and the breast cancer cell line T47D, demonstrating that these effects are widespread in multiple cancer types (Fig. S12). In line with it, when the shRNA experiments were performed in MDA-MB-435 that endogenously express a low level of Hsp70 protein, Hsp70 knockdown has no effect on the levels of AKT and Raf-1, and Bim knockdown paralleled the effect of Hsp70 (Fig. 3E). In summary, the Hsp70/Bim complex plays a critical role to facilitate the chaperone function of Hsp70 toward client proteins, which hinted that outcome of the Hsp70/Bim complex is to promote the oncogenic chaperone activity of Hsp70. Furthermore, a dual role of Hsp70's anti-apoptotic function was illustrated in T47D and MDA-MB-435 cells following ABT-737 treatment that Hsp70 not only antagonizes Bim to protect cells from apoptosis, but also enhances the tumor chaperone's effect on stabilizing oncogenic clients with the help of the positive co-chaperone Bim. ABT-737 is one of the most established small-molecule Bcl-2 inhibitors that induce intrinsic apoptosis by releasing pro-apoptotic Bim from Bcl-2 complexes. Its analog ABT-199 is the first FDA approved Bcl-2 inhibitor (26Souers A.J. Leverson J.D. Boghaert E.R. Ackler S.L. Catron N.D. Chen J. Dayton B.D. Ding H. Enschede S.H. Fairbrother W.J. Huang D.C.S.

Although a previous report has found that mitochondria from T47D and MDA-MB-435 were similarly primed with Bim, only MDA-MB-435 cells exhibit the expected sensitivity to ABT-737 (28Kale J. Kutuk O.

Owing to uncertainties and crisis amid the pandemic, as an emergency announcement, the World Health Organization (WHO) solicits the help of health authorities, especially, researchers to conduct in-depth research on the evolution and treatment of COVID-19. This paper proposes an integer-valued time series model to analyze the series of COVID-19 cases in Mauritius wherein the corresponding innovation term accommodates for covariate specification. In this set-up, sanitary curfew followed by sanitization and sensitization campaigns, time factor and safe shopping guidelines have been tested as the most significant variables, unlike climatic conditions. The over-dispersion estimates and the serial auto-correlation parameter are also statistically significant. This study also confirms the presence of some unobservable effects like the pathological genesis of the novel coronavirus and environmental factors which contribute to rapid propagation of the zoonotic virus in the community. Based on the proposed COM-Poisson mixture models, we could predict the number of COVID-19 cases in Mauritius. The forecasting results provide satisfactory mean squared errors.

Chronic hepatitis B develops by the interaction between hepatitis B virus (HBV) and host immune response. However, questions of how HBV-infected cells thwart immune system defenses remain unanswered. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are used for cellular communication, carrying cargoes such as RNAs, proteins, and lipids and delivering them intracellularly after being endocytosed by target cells. HBV-infected liver cells secrete several types of EVs into body fluids such as complete and incomplete virions, and exosomes. We previously demonstrated that monocytes that incorporated EVs moved to immunoregulatory phenotypes via up-regulation of PD-L1, an immunocheckpoint molecule, and down-regulation of CD69, a leukocyte activation molecule. In this study, we transfected mice with HBV using hydrodynamic injection and studied the effects of EVs secreted by HBV-infected liver cells. EVs secreted from cells with HBV replication strongly suppressed the immune response, inhibiting the eradication of HBV-replicating cells in the mice transfected with HBV. EVs were systemically incorporated in multiple organs, including liver, bone marrow (BM), and intestine. Intriguingly, the BM cells that incorporated EVs acquired intestinal tropism and the dendritic cell populations in the intestine increased. These findings suggest that the EVs secreted by HBV-infected liver cells exert immunosuppressive functions, and that an association between the liver, bone marrow, and intestinal tract exists through EVs secreted from HBV-infected cells.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major global health burden. Approximately 2 billion people are currently infected with HBV, and among them, more than 257 million are chronic HBV carriers (1Liaw Y.F. Chu C.M. Hepatitis B virus infection.Lancet. 2009; 373 (19217993): 582-59210.1016/S0140-6736(09)60207-5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar, 2World Health Organization Global Hepatitis Report. WHO, Geneva2017Google Scholar). Chronic hepatitis B is a risk for cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, and more than 700,000 people die from HBV-related diseases each year (3Tuaillon E. Lozano C. Kuster N. Poinso A. Kania D. Nagot N. Mondain A.M. Pageaux G.P. Ducos J. Van de Perre P. Reynes J. Long-term hepatitis B virus surface antigen decay in HIV-1/hepatitis B virus-coinfected adults initiating a tenofovir-containing regimen.J. Clin.

The control of viral infection and the degree of liver damage depend on the complex interaction between viral replication and the host's immune response (1Liaw Y.F. Chu C.M. Hepatitis B virus infection.Lancet. 2009; 373 (19217993): 582-59210.1016/S0140-6736(09)60207-5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). Multiple mechanisms of host immune responses, including robust CD8+ T cell and neutralizing antibody responses, are extremely important for viral clearance (4Dandri M. Locarnini S.

However, these host immune responses are usually dysregulated in persistent HBV infection. The dysregulation mechanism is still not completely understood. One of the possible mechanisms by which HBV-infected hepatocytes interact and communicate with the host immune system and other uninfected cells is through extracellular vesicles (EVs) (6Anderson M.R. Kashanchi F. Jacobson S. Exosomes in viral disease.Neurotherapeutics. 2016; 13 (27324390): 535-54610.1007/s13311-016-0450-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 7Raab-Traub N. Dittmer D.P.

EVs are secreted from various cell types to the extracellular milieu. EVs are either released directly from the plasma membrane or during fusion between multivesicular bodies (MVBs) and the plasma membrane (8Raposo G. Stoorvogel W. Extracellular vesicles: exosomes, microvesicles, and friends.J. Cell Biol. 2013; 200 (23420871): 373-38310.1083/jcb.201211138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3924) Google Scholar, 9Kowal J. Tkach M. Thery C.

EVs that are released from MVBs are termed exosomes. These nanoscale membrane-enclosed vesicles carry a variety of bio-macromolecules, such as proteins, mRNA, microRNA, and other noncoding RNAs (10Jia S. Zocco D. Samuels M.L. Chou M.F. Chammas R. Skog J. Zarovni N. Momen-Heravi F. Kuo W.P. Emerging technologies in extracellular vesicle-based molecular diagnostics.Expert Rev. Mol.

Similar to EVs, viruses are released from the plasma membrane, through several pathways, and even through the MVB route (12Meckes Jr., D.G. Exosomal communication goes viral.J. Virol. 2015; 89 (25740980): 5200-520310.1128/JVI.02470-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is suggested that some viruses can utilize the exosomal pathway for cell-to-cell spread to avoid the immune system surveillance (12Meckes Jr., D.G. Exosomal communication goes viral.J. Virol. 2015; 89 (25740980): 5200-520310.1128/JVI.02470-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In recent years, it has been reported that the contents of EVs are modulated by viral infection (13Jia X. Chen J. Megger D.A. Zhang X. Kozlowski M. Zhang L. Fang Z. Li J. Chu Q. Wu M. Li Y. Sitek B. Yuan Z. Label-free proteomeic analysis of exosomes derived from inducible hepatitis B virus-replicating HepAD38 cell line.Mol. Cell.

For example, EVs released from hepatitis C virus-infected cells promoted the proliferation of T follicular regulatory cells and regulated germinal center responses by limiting T follicular helper cells and B cells (14Cobb D.A. Kim O.K. Golden-Mason L. Rosen H.R. Hahn Y.S. Hepatocyte-derived exosomes promote T follicular regulatory cell expansion during hepatitis C virus infection.Hepatology. 2018; 67 (28749570): 71-8510.1002/hep.29409Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Epstein Bar virus (EBV) encodes its own small RNAs packed into the EVs, which are then used to manipulate the immune system to establish a tumor microenvironment (15Higuchi H. Yamakawa N. Imadome K.I. Yahata T. Kotaki R. Ogata J. Kakizaki M. Fujita K. Lu J. Yokoyama K. Okuyama K. Sato A. Takamatsu M. Kurosaki N.

Recently, the role of EVs in the liver microenvironment in response to HBV infection have been reported. Kouwaki et al. (16Kouwaki T. Fukushima Y. Daito T. Sanada T. Yamamoto N. Mifsud E.J. Leong C.R. Tsukiyama-Kohara K. Kohara M. Matsumoto M. Seya T. Oshiumi H. Extracellular vesicles including exosomes regulate innate immune responses to hepatitis B virus infection.Front. Immunol. 2016; 7 (27630638): 33510.3389/fimmu.2016.00335Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) found that HBV infection of hepatocytes increased immunoregulatory microRNA levels in EVs to regulate innate immune responses to the virus. Yang et al. (17Yang Y. Han Q. Hou Z. Zhang C. Tian Z. Zhang J. Exosomes mediate hepatitis B virus (HBV) transmission and NK-cell dysfunction.Cell. Mol. Immunol. 2017; 14 (27238466): 465-47510.1038/cmi.2016.24Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) demonstrated that exosomes circulating in the sera of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients contained both HBV nucleic acids and proteins. These exosomes ingested by NK cells played a role in NK-cell dysfunction thus in HBV transmission (17Yang Y. Han Q. Hou Z. Zhang C. Tian Z. Zhang J. Exosomes mediate hepatitis B virus (HBV) transmission and NK-cell dysfunction.Cell. Mol. Immunol. 2017; 14 (27238466): 465-47510.1038/cmi.2016.24Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Our previous work revealed that HBV-replicating cells secreting EVs targeted peripheral blood monocytes and significantly up-regulated programmed death 1 ligand-1 (PD-L1) protein expression, a critical immune regulatory molecule, and down-regulated CD69, a leukocyte activation molecule (18Kakizaki M. Yamamoto Y. Yabuta S. Kurosaki N. Kagawa T. Kotani A. The immune function of extracellular vesicles in hepatitis B virus-infected hepatocytes.PLoS ONE. 2018; 13 (30596665)e020588610.1371/journal.pone.0205886Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, these roles of EVs secreted from HBV-infected cells were studied only with in vitro experiments. Hence, the biological significance of EVs secreted from HBV-infected hepatocytes remains elusive, which was the aim of this study. In this study, the role of EVs secreted from HBV-infected cells in the regulation of the viral infection was investigated in an in vivo system. We evidenced that EVs were immunosuppressive to inhibit the eradication of HBV-replicating cells in the hydrodynamic HBV transfection mouse model. Furthermore, EVs were systemically incorporated in multiple organs, including the liver, bone marrow (BM), and intestine. BM cells that incorporated EVs migrated to the intestine. EVs were isolated from the culture supernatants of HBV-replicating (HepAD38) or HBV-nonreplicating (HepG2) cells. These EVs were characterized using transmission EM, nanoparticle tracking analysis, and LC–MS proteomic analysis. These EVs showed the typical exosome-like round morphology by transmission EM (Fig. 1A). The qNano analysis of these EVs indicated that the vesicles were ∼100 nm in diameter (Fig. 1B). The presence of CD63, which is common EV/exosome marker, was analyzed by Western blotting (Fig. 1C). 169 protein groups and 153 protein groups were identified in HBV-replicating and HBV-nonreplicating cells, respectively, using LC–MS proteomic analysis (Fig. 1D). The identified proteins information are listed in Tables S1 and S2. Of 169 protein groups detected in HBV-replicating cells EVs, 13 were present in the top 100 proteins that are often identified in EVs (from Vesiclepedia of EVs proteome). Moreover, of 153 protein groups detected in HBV-nonreplicating cells EVs, 12 were present in the top 100 proteins that are often identified in EVs (Fig. 1D). The in vivo function of EVs secreted from HBV-replicating cells was investigated with an in vivo mouse model of HBV transfection by using hydrodynamic injection (HDI). HDI is a technique that is used deliver nucleic acids into live mice. Delivery through this method results in the in vivo transfection of foreign DNA primarily in the liver. The HBV HDI mouse model is useful tool for studying the host immune response, the pathophysiology of HBV-related disease, and several antiviral drugs (19Ketzinel-Gilad M. Zauberman A. Nussbaum O.

Inflammation was induced by immunizing mice with a licensed aluminum-based recombinant HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) vaccine before introduction of HBV replicon plasmid, as HDI alone causes almost no liver inflammation (22Matsumoto T. Takahashi K. Inuzuka T. Kim S.K. Kurosaki T. Kawakami S. Chiba T. Seno H. Marusawa H. Activation of TNF-α-AID axis and co-inhibitory signals in coordinateon with Th1-type immunity in a mouse model recapitulating hepatitis B.Antiviral.

Timeline for the experiment of the HBV HDI mouse model is shown in Fig. 2A. 3 days after HDI, the histological examination revealed remarkably less infiltration of mononuclear cells in the liver of mice treated with EVs derived from HepAD38 cells regardless of HBV induction, as a difference to that observed in mice without the treatment (Fig. 2B). Moreover, the number of hepatocytes positive for the HBV core antigens (HBcAg) slightly increased in the liver of mice treated with the EVs derived from the HBV-induced HepAD38 than that observed without HBV induction (Fig. 2, C and D). Moreover, HBcAg-positive hepatocytes were barely detected in liver sections from mice without treatment (Fig. 2, C and D). The results suggested that HBV-replicating cells escaped from immune cells in the liver of the mice treated with EVs, especially after HBV induction, indicating that EVs derived from HepAD38 cells had immunosuppressive functions and that more activity was obtained by HBV replication. As EVs derived from tumor cells suppressed the immune responses (23Clayton A. Mitchell J.P. Court J. Mason M.D. Tabi Z. Human tumor-derived exosomes selectively impair lymphocyte responses to interleukin-2.Cancer Res. 2007; 67 (17671216): 7458-746610.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-3456Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 24Wieckowski E.U.

Then to confirm that HBV infection itself caused EVs to exert immunosuppressive activity, the EVs collected from the sera of healthy donors and HBV patients was tested. These EVs were characterized using nanoparticle tracking analysis (Fig. S1). Clinical data of the patients are listed in the Table 1. Few if any HBcAg-positive hepatocytes were detected in the liver of the mice treated with EVs from healthy donors (Fig. 3A), whereas significant HBcAg-positive hepatocytes were observed in those of HBV patients (Fig. 3, B and C). Furthermore, HBcAg was not detected in the liver of mice treated with EVs derived from HBV patients alone without HDI (Fig. S2). These results suggested that HBV infection potentiated the EV immunosuppressive ability. Though the difference of the ability of the EVs secreted from HBV-replicating cells and nonreplicating cells was small, the data in Fig. 3 provides more evidence that the tiny change might be biologically relevant.Table 1Clinical data of the patientsPatient numberSexAgeHBV genotypeNRTIs treatmentaNRTI, nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors.HBV DNA (log copies/ml)HBsAg IU/ml1M27NAbNA, not abilable.NoNA45.72M21NANoNANA3M43NANoNANA4M26CNo9.32>5005M34CNo8.94NAa NRTI, nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors.b NA, not abilable. Open table in a new tab Still patient samples showed variable HBcAg positivity. Few HBcAg-positive hepatocytes were detected in the liver of the mice treated with EVs from one HBV patient (patient 1) with massive HBcAg-positive hepatocytes in patients 4 and 5. It may depend on the disease phases. The function of the EVs may be different between patients in the immune tolerant phase and patients in the immune active phase. Liver-draining lymph nodes (LNs) induced an anti-HBV–specific immune response responsible for HBV clearance in HBV plasmid-injected mice (26Zheng M. Yu J. Tian Z. Characterization of the liver-draining lymph nodes in mice and their role in mounting regional immunity to HBV.Cell. Mol. Immunol. 2013; 10 (23376862): 143-15010.1038/cmi.2012.59Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Thus, we investigated liver-draining LNs in mice 3 days after HDI and EVs injection. The percentages of CD3+ CD4+, CD3+ CD8+ T and B220+ B cells in liver-draining LNs in mice did not change after injection of EVs derived from an HBV patient (Figs. S3 and S4). Furthermore, the percentages of CD11c+ dendritic cells (DCs) and F4/80+ macrophages in liver-draining LNs in mice were no different after injection of EVs derived from an HBV patient (Fig. 4A). These results indicated that EVs derived from an HBV patient did not affect the ratio of immune cells in liver-draining LNs. Previously, we reported that HBV-replicating cells secreting EVs targeted antigen presentation cells, which expressed almost no PD-L1 and significantly induced PD-L1 protein expression (18Kakizaki M. Yamamoto Y. Yabuta S. Kurosaki N. Kagawa T. Kotani A. The immune function of extracellular vesicles in hepatitis B virus-infected hepatocytes.PLoS ONE. 2018; 13 (30596665)e020588610.1371/journal.pone.0205886Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in vitro studies have shown that in chronic HBV infection, blockade of the PD-1–PD-L1 axis can increase both the production of HBV antibodies (27Salimzadeh L. Le Bert N. Dutertre C.A. Gill U.S. Newell E.W. Frey C. Hung M. Novikov N. Fletcher S. Kennedy P.T. Bertoletti A. PD-1 blockade partially recovers dysfunctional virus-specific B cells in chronic hepatitis B infection.J. Clin.

Next, we investigated PD-L1 expression in liver-draining LN. The expression of PD-L1 in the liver-draining LN showed no difference in B cells (Fig. S5). CD3+ PD-L1+ T cells increased in the mice injected with HBV patient-derived EVs, compared with those with healthy donor-derived EVs (Fig. S5), Furthermore, the ratio of CD11c+ PD-L1+ DCs increased significantly in mice injected with HBV patient-derived EVs (Fig. 4B), compared with that in mice injected with healthy donor-derived EVs. The up-regulation of PD-L1 in CD11c+ DCs may be one of the mechanisms inducing suppression of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells. Previously, we evidenced that a significant amount of the EVs secreted by EBV-infected tumor cells were engulfed by local macrophages in the tumor microenvironment and bone marrow monocytes (15Higuchi H. Yamakawa N. Imadome K.I. Yahata T. Kotaki R. Ogata J. Kakizaki M. Fujita K. Lu J. Yokoyama K. Okuyama K. Sato A. Takamatsu M. Kurosaki N. Alba S.M. et al.Role of exosomes as a proinflammatory mediator in the development of EBV-associated lymphoma.Blood. 2018; 131 (29685921): 2552-256710.1182/blood-2017-07-794529Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Therefore, the systemic biodistribution of the EVs derived from HBV-replicating cells was examined. PKH-26–labeled EVs secreted from HepAD38 cells were injected in the tail vein of mice, and after 24 h, cryosections were prepared for each organ and observed with a confocal laser microscopy. According to Fig. S6, EVs mainly accumulated in liver, liver-draining LNs, and spleen. Also, cells that ingested EVs were detected in plasma and in particular, in the bone marrow (Fig. 5). These results suggested that EVs secreted from HBV-replicating cells were locally and systemically engulfed. Later, we investigated the significance of EVs uptake in bone marrow. BM cells were collected from three mice. PKH-26-labeled EVs secreted from HBV-replicating cells or -nonreplicating cells were added into the BM cells culture. After 24 h, the entire BM cells including PKH-26–positive and –negative cells were transplanted into three recipient mice. After 24 h, cryosections were prepared for each organ and observed with a confocal laser microscopy. Transplanted BM cells with PKH-26–labeled EVs (BM-EVs) were detected in the liver and in particular, in the intestine (Fig. 6A), especially in the small intestine near the stomach and colon (Fig. 6B). Next, we investigated whether population of the bone marrow cells change by taking up EVs from HBV-replicating cells. The proportion of CD11b+ CD11c+ CD103+ cells to entire BM cells, immunoregulatory DC populations in the intestine, was increased after HBV-replicating cells derived EVs added into BM cells culture, and the majority of those cells were PKH-26 positive (Fig. 6C). Furthermore, CD11c+ CD103+ or CD11b+ CD103+ BM-EVs cells, which indicated the regulatory DC-like cells, were detected in the small intestine 24 h after transplanting BM-EVs (Fig. 6D). These results suggested existence of the association between the liver, bone marrow, and intestinal tract through EVs secreted from HBV-replicating cells and that bone marrow cells incorporating EVs secreted from HBV-replicating cells may be involved in intestinal immunity. In this study, we showed that the EVs secreted from HBV-replicating hepatocytes had immunosuppressive functions that inhibit the eradication of HBV-replicating hepatocytes. Furthermore, we identified a novel axis of liver–BM–gut mediated by the EVs from HBV-replicating cells, which possibly exerts critical functions in chronic hepatitis B. One important consideration in this type of studies is the method of EVs preparation, because it significantly affects its heterogenous composition. The EVs obtained in this study were collected by ultracentrifugation, which is still a gold standard method. The fraction of the EVs included incomplete and complete forms of the HBV virus, except for exosomes (18Kakizaki M. Yamamoto Y. Yabuta S. Kurosaki N. Kagawa T. Kotani A. The immune function of extracellular vesicles in hepatitis B virus-infected hepatocytes.PLoS ONE. 2018; 13 (30596665)e020588610.1371/journal.pone.0205886Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). As HBV does not infect rodents, the presence of HBcAg observed in the liver of mice treated the EVs derived from HBV-replicating hepatocytes was not due to extra HBV infection. The incomplete form mainly consisted of two types. The first type was the classical HBsAg spheres and filaments of 20 nm in diameter (HBsAg particles). These subviral particles were composed of only the viral surface proteins and were found in the blood of infected individuals at up to 100,000-fold in excess over the complete virions (at 1014/ml) (30Blumberg B.S. Australia antigen and the biology of hepatitis B.Science. 1977; 197 (325649): 17-2510.1126/science.325649Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The second class is empty genome-free virions, which contain the surface proteins enclosing the viral capsid but no genome, and are typically found at 100-fold higher levels over the complete virions in the blood of infected individuals (31Ning X.

In CHB patients, free HBsAg particles bind to anti-HBs antibodies, working as “decoy” for HBV-infected hepatocyte to escape from immune attack. In contrast, as the hydrodynamic HBV transfection model induces immune reaction by vaccination of HBsAg, the HBsAg on the subviral particles should induce an immunoreactive reaction. Previously we reported that subviral particles strongly induced PD-L1 in monocytes (18Kakizaki M. Yamamoto Y. Yabuta S. Kurosaki N. Kagawa T. Kotani A.

Accordingly, the function of the subviral particles might contribute to the immunosuppressive functions of the EVs. The results on EVs in HBV infection obtained using only the in vitro experiments are still controversial. Kowaki et al. (16Kouwaki T. Fukushima Y. Daito T. Sanada T. Yamamoto N. Mifsud E.J.

There is a general avoidance of the topic and contemplating ACP in healthcare-limited regions can be an ethically complex subject. Nonetheless, evidence from similar settings indicate that an appropriate quality of life is valued, even as one is dying. What differs amongst cultures is the definition of a 'good death'.Evaluate perceptions of quality of death and advance EoL preparation in Moshi, Tanzania.13 focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted in Swahili using a semi-structured guide. These discussions were audio-recorded, transcribed, translated, and coded using an inductive approach.Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre (KCMC), referral hospital for northern Tanzania.A total of 122 participants, including patients with life-threatening illnesses (34), their relatives/friends (29), healthcare professionals (29; HCPs; doctors and nurses), and allied HCPs (30; community health workers, religious leaders, and social workers) from KCMC, or nearby within Moshi, participated in this study.In characterizing Good Death, 7 first-order themes emerged, and, of these themes, Religious & Spiritual Wellness, Family & Interpersonal Wellness, Grief Coping & Emotional Wellness, and Optimal Timing comprised the second-order theme, EoL Preparation and Life Completion. The other first-order themes for Good Death were Minimal Suffering & Burden, Quality of Care by Formal Caregivers, and Quality of Care by Informal Caregivers.The results of this study provide a robust thematic description of Good Death in northern Tanzania and they lay the groundwork for future clinical and research endeavors to improve the quality of EoL care at KCMC."
https://openalex.org/W4249564242,"Background Limited data are available on prevalence and associated risk factors for atopy and allergic diseases from high-altitude urban settings in Latin America. Objective To estimate the prevalence of atopy, asthma, rhinitis, and eczema, and associations with relevant risk factors in preschool children in the Andean city of Cuenca. Methods A cross-sectional study was undertaken using a representative sample of 535 children aged 3–5 years attending 30 nursery schools in the city of Cuenca, Ecuador. Data on allergic diseases and risk factors were collected by parental questionnaire. Atopy was measured by skin prick test (SPT) reactivity to a panel of relevant aeroallergens. Associations between risk factors and the prevalence of atopy and allergic diseases were estimated using multivariable logistic regression. Results Asthma symptoms were reported for 18% of children, rhinitis for 48%, and eczema for 28%, while SPT reactivity was present in 33%. Population fractions of asthma, rhinitis, and eczema attributable to SPT were 3.4%, 7.9%, and 2.9%, respectively. In multivariable models, an increased risk of asthma was observed among children with a maternal history of rhinitis (OR 1.85); rhinitis was significantly increased in children of high compared to low socioeconomic level (OR 2.09), among children with a maternal history of rhinitis (OR 2.29) or paternal history of eczema (OR 2.07), but reduced among children attending daycare (OR 0.64); eczema was associated with a paternal history of eczema (OR 3.73), and SPT was associated with having a dog inside the house (OR 1.67). Conclusions A high prevalence of asthma, rhinitis, and eczema symptoms were observed among preschool children in a high-altitude Andean setting. Despite a high prevalence of atopy, only a small fraction of symptoms was associated with atopy. Parental history of allergic diseases was the most consistent risk factor for symptoms in preschool children."
https://openalex.org/W3041408541,"The final steps in the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone signaling System (RAAS) involve binding of the corticosteroid hormone, aldosterone to its mineralocorticoid receptor (MR). The bound MR interacts with response elements to induce or repress the transcription of aldosterone-regulated genes. A well characterized aldosterone-induced gene is the serum and glucocorticoid-induced kinase (SGK1), which acts downstream to increase sodium transport in distal kidney nephron epithelial cells. The role of microRNAs (miRs) induced by extended aldosterone stimulation in regulating MR and SGK1 has not been reported. In these studies, miRs predicted to bind to the 3ʹ-UTR of mouse MR were profiled by qRT-PCR after aldosterone stimulation. The miR-466a/b/c/e family was upregulated in mouse kidney cortical collecting duct epithelial cells. A luciferase reporter assay confirmed miR-466 binding to both MR and SGK1 3ʹ-UTRs. Inhibition of miR-466 increased MR and SGK1 mRNA and protein levels. Inhibiting miR-466b and preventing its upregulation after aldosterone stimulation increased amiloride-sensitive sodium transport and sensitivity to aldosterone stimulation. In vivo upregulation of miR-466 was confirmed in distal nephrons of mice on low Na+ diets. Repression of MR and SGK1 by aldosterone-induced miRs may represent a negative feedback loop that contributes to a form of aldosterone escape in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W3041247551,"Human riboflavin kinase (HsRFK) catalyzes vitamin B2 (riboflavin) phosphorylation to flavin mononucleotide (FMN), obligatory step in flavin cofactor synthesis. HsRFK expression is related to protection from oxidative stress, amyloid-β toxicity, and some malignant cancers progression. Its downregulation alters expression profiles of clock-controlled metabolic-genes and destroys flavins protection on stroke treatments, while its activity reduction links to protein-energy malnutrition and thyroid hormones decrease. We explored specific features of the mechanisms underlying the regulation of HsRFK activity, showing that both reaction products regulate it through competitive inhibition. Fast-kinetic studies show that despite HsRFK binds faster and preferably the reaction substrates, the complex holding both products is kinetically most stable. An intricate ligand binding landscape with all combinations of substrates/products competing with the catalytic complex and exhibiting moderate cooperativity is also presented. These data might contribute to better understanding the molecular bases of pathologies coursing with aberrant HsRFK availability, and envisage that interaction with its client-apoproteins might favor FMN release. Finally, HsRFK parameters differ from those of the so far evaluated bacterial counterparts, reinforcing the idea of species-specific mechanisms in RFK catalysis. These observations support HsRFK as potential therapeutic target because of its key functions, while also envisage bacterial RFK modules as potential antimicrobial targets."
https://openalex.org/W3041912348,"Gene editing in large animal models for future applications in translational medicine and food production must be deeply investigated for an increase of knowledge. The mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) is a member of the HMGB subfamily that binds to mtDNA promoters. This gene maintains mtDNA, and it is essential for the initiation of mtDNA transcription. Lately, we generated a new cell line through the disruption of the TFAM gene in bovine fibroblast cells by CRISPR/Cas 9 technology. We showed that the CRISPR/Cas9 design was efficient through the generation of heterozygous mutant clones. In this context, once this gene regulates the mtDNA replication specificity, the study aimed to determine if the post-edited cells are capable of in vitro maintenance and assess if they present changes in mtDNA copies and mitochondrial membrane potential after successive passages in culture. The post-edited cells were expanded in culture, and we performed a growth curve, doubling time, cell viability, mitochondrial DNA copy number, and mitochondrial membrane potential assays. The editing process did not make cell culture unfeasible, even though cell growth rate and viability were decreased compared to control since we observed the cells grow well when cultured in a medium supplemented with uridine and pyruvate. They also exhibited a classical fibroblastoid appearance. The RT-qPCR to determine the mtDNA copy number showed a decrease in the edited clones compared to the non-edited ones (control) in different cell passages. Cell staining with Mitotracker Green and red suggests a reduction in red fluorescence in the edited cells compared to the non-edited cells. Thus, through characterization, we demonstrated that the TFAM gene is critical to mitochondrial maintenance due to its interference in the stability of the mitochondrial DNA copy number in different cell passages and membrane potential confirming the decrease in mitochondrial activity in cells edited in heterozygosis."

Between March and July 2019, we identified 217 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of epilepsy, receiving oral ASM therapy and able to administer their medications. We performed a semi-structured interview to gather information on sociodemographic background, clinical and medication history, and perceptions on healthcare services. Adherence to ASM therapy was evaluated using the Medication Compliance Questionnaire (MCQ). Patient's illness perception was assessed by the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire (B-IPQ).208 patients participated in this study. The median age of the study participants was 35 years (IQR 26-44). 58.2% were females and majority, 55.8%, were from the Malay ethnic group. Based on the MCQ scoring, 89 patients (42.8%) were non-adherent. Multiple logistic regression demonstrated that being employed or students (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.26, 95%CI: 1.19-4.29 p = 0.012) and having an average or below average perceived access to pharmacy services (aOR 2.94, 95%CI: 1.38-6.24, p = 0.005) were significant contributors to non-adherence.Being employed or students and having an average or below average perceived access to pharmacy services were associated with ASM non-adherence Efforts to improve ASM adherence should adopt a comprehensive approach considering the success of adherence is contingent on the interrelationship of multiple dimensions."
https://openalex.org/W3042138900,"In skeletal muscle fibers, mitochondria are densely packed adjacent to myofibrils because adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is needed to fuel sarcomere shortening. However, despite this close physical and biochemical relationship, the effects of mitochondrial dynamics on skeletal muscle contractility are poorly understood. In this study, we analyzed the effects of Mitochondrial Division Inhibitor 1 (mdivi-1), an inhibitor of mitochondrial fission, on the structure and function of both mitochondria and myofibrils in skeletal muscle tissues engineered on micromolded gelatin hydrogels. Treatment with mdivi-1 did not alter myotube morphology, but did increase the mitochondrial turbidity and oxidative capacity, consistent with reduced mitochondrial fission. Mdivi-1 also significantly increased basal, twitch, and tetanus stresses, as measured using the Muscular Thin Film (MTF) assay. Finally, mdivi-1 increased sarcomere length, potentially due to mdivi-1-induced changes in mitochondrial volume and compression of myofibrils. Together, these results suggest that mdivi-1 increases contractile stress generation, which may be caused by an increase in maximal respiration and/or sarcomere length due to increased volume of individual mitochondria. These data reinforce that mitochondria have both biochemical and biomechanical roles in skeletal muscle and that mitochondrial dynamics can be manipulated to alter muscle contractility."
https://openalex.org/W4247121531,"Background Since 2005, the Smoking Treatment for Ontario Patients (STOP) program has provided smoking cessation treatment of varying form and intensity to smokers through 11 distinct treatment models, either in-person at partnering healthcare organizations or remotely via web or telephone. We aimed to characterize the patient populations reached by different treatment models. Methods We linked self-report data to health administrative databases to describe sociodemographics, physical and mental health comorbidity, healthcare utilization and costs. Our sample consisted of 107,302 patients who enrolled between 18Oct2005 and 31Mar2016, across 11 models operational during different time periods. Results Patient populations varied on sociodemographics, comorbidity burden, and healthcare usage. Enrollees in the Web-based model were youngest (median age: 39; IQR: 29–49), and enrollees in primary care-based Family Health Teams were oldest (median: 51; IQR: 40–60). Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease and hypertension were the most common physical health comorbidities, twice as prevalent in Family Health Teams (32.3% and 30.8%) than in the direct-to-smoker (Web and Telephone) and Pharmacy models (13.5%-16.7% and 14.7%-17.7%). Depression, the most prevalent mental health diagnosis, was twice as prevalent in the Addiction Agency (52.1%) versus the Telephone model (25.3%). Median healthcare costs in the two years up to enrollment ranged from $1,787 in the Telephone model to $9,393 in the Addiction Agency model. Discussion While practitioner-mediated models in specialized and primary care settings reached smokers with more complex healthcare needs, alternative settings appear better suited to reach younger smokers before such comorbidities develop. Although Web and Telephone models were expected to have fewer barriers to access, they reached a lower proportion of patients in rural areas and of lower socioeconomic status. Findings suggest that in addition to population-based strategies, embedding smoking cessation treatment into existing healthcare settings that reach patient populations with varying disparities may enhance equitable access to treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3041059080,"The cerebellum (CB) has extensive connections with both cortical and subcortical areas of the brain, and is known to strongly influence function in areas it projects to. In particular, research using non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) has shown that CB projections to primary motor cortex (M1) are likely important for facilitating the learning of new motor skills, and that this process may involve modulation of late indirect (I) wave inputs in M1. However, the nature of this relationship remains unclear, particularly in regards to how CB influences the contribution of the I-wave circuits to neuroplastic changes in M1. Within the proposed research, we will therefore investigate how CB effects neuroplasticity of the I-wave generating circuits. This will be achieved by downregulating CB excitability while concurrently applying a neuroplastic intervention that specifically targets the I-wave circuitry. The outcomes of this study will provide valuable neurophysiological insight into key aspects of the motor network, and may inform the development of optimized interventions for modifying motor learning in a targeted way."

However, the parameters of the model are always from a general case and not adapted to a specific patient. In this study, we focused on on-line parameter identification of the lumped model of the arterial system that could be used for a specific patient. A five-element lumped arterial model is adopted in this study, in which the five parameters are to be determined. The aortic flow rate and the venous pressure are chosen as the inputs of the model, and aortic pressure as the output. An iterative optimization based on the established state space equations of the five-element model is used to seek the best parameter values by minimizing the difference between the model prediction and the previously obtained aortic pressure. The method is validated using simulated data from a complete numerical cardiovascular model. Results show that the method can track the dynamic variation of the parameters very well. Finally, a sensitivity analysis of the model parameters is conducted to interpret the effect of parameter changes. The good performance of the identification demonstrates the potential application of this method to customize a hybrid mock loop for a specific patient or clinically monitor the arterial vessel characteristics in real time."

Although the structure of the PSI is known, detailed information regarding the role and mechanism of the PSI in membrane fusion is still lacking. It is possible that the various SAPLIP proteins could have very different sequence-dependent mechanisms, despite having similar structures (17Qi X. Grabowski G.A. Differential membrane interactions of saposins A and C: implications for the functional specificity.J. Biol.

Earlier work has indicated the pH-triggered dimerization of PSI and suggested that dimeric PSI is the active form for membrane fusion (9Bryksa B.C. Prasenjit B. Eugenia M. De Moura D.C. Martin K. Alexander Z. Dutcher J.R. Alexander W. Yada R.Y. Structure and mechanism of the saposin-like domain of a plant aspartic protease.J. Biol.

Although it is known that the acidic condition is mandatory for PSI activity, the relationship between the formation of the PSI dimer and the pH-triggered activity remains unclear. It is possible that (i) the acidic pH induces the dimers that can fuse the membrane or (ii) low pH neutralizes the protein surface charges, which is the factor critical to the PSI functions. Further, characterizing the topology of a membrane fusion protein on a membrane is often challenging. In the present study, an integrative approach using NMR, FRET, and in silico methods demonstrated the details of the mechanisms of PSI. We show that under acidic conditions, the PSI undergoes monomer-dimer equilibrium in a pH-dependent manner. However, the ability of PSI dimers is insufficient to induce membrane fusion; the PSI interacts strongly with the phospholipid membranes and induces full membrane fusion only at pH values below a certain critical pH. Upon binding with membranes, the PSI resides in a highly dehydrated environment, suggesting an ability to drive membrane fusion by reducing the dehydration energy barrier between liposomes. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations revealed the most likely configurations of dimeric PSI on model membranes. These results provide evidence that it is possible that the PSI could interact with two liposomes at the same time and bring them into close proximity, which may be a critical step in the early stages of membrane fusion, therefore providing new insights into the mechanisms by which the PSI functions in a defensive role in plants to disrupt the pathogen membrane. The PSI was reported to trigger membrane fusion in a pH-dependent manner (9Bryksa B.C. Prasenjit B. Eugenia M. De Moura D.C. Martin K. Alexander Z. Dutcher J.R. Alexander W. Yada R.Y.

In this study, a fluorescence-based fusion assay was used to study the PSI activity at various pH values. Two different types of liposomes were prepared, including nonfluorescent liposomes (containing egg phosphatidylcholine (PC), egg phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and brain phosphatidylserine (PS) phospholipids) and fluorescent liposomes containing the aforementioned phospholipids, as well as N-(7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)-phosphatidylethanolamine (NBD-PE) and N-(lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl)-phosphatidylethanolamine (Rho-PE). Rho-PE and NBD-PE serve as the fluorescence acceptor and donor, respectively. The close proximity of fluorophore groups quenches the FRET resonance at 535 nm, with excitation at 465 nm. The fluorescent and nonfluorescent liposomes were mixed at a ratio of 1:9, with the lipid mixing being expected to result in a significant increase in the fluorescent resonance due to dilution of fluorophore lipids by nonmodified lipids. The fluorescence-based fusion assays were conducted over a range of pH values from pH 7.0 to 2.0. Upon the addition of the PSI into the liposome solution at pH 7.0, no fluorescence intensity changes were observed, indicating no membrane fusion. In contrast, the addition of the PSI to liposome in acidic conditions resulted in a significant increase in fluorescence intensities, suggesting the occurrence of membrane fusion by PSI (Fig. 1A). The fusion efficiency at different pH values was measured by comparing the fluorescence intensities at 1200 s after mixing the PSI and the liposomes with those obtained by the addition of Triton X-100 to the liposome at the same pH. Fig. 1B plots the fusion efficiency against pH, showing a sharp increase in fusion activity within a narrow range of pH 5.0 to 4.5. This result indicates that PSI effectively acts as a membrane fusion protein below a critical pH around 4.5, in agreement with the physiological findings that the PSI is functional under acidic conditions (18Guevara M.G.

Earlier studies demonstrated that the PSI experiences pH-dependent monomer-dimer equilibrium (9Bryksa B.C. Prasenjit B. Eugenia M. De Moura D.C. Martin K. Alexander Z. Dutcher J.R. Alexander W. Yada R.Y. Structure and mechanism of the saposin-like domain of a plant aspartic protease.J. Biol.

The saposin-family proteins commonly form dimers to act as membrane fusion proteins (17Qi X. Grabowski G.A. Differential membrane interactions of saposins A and C: implications for the functional specificity.J. Biol.

Here, solution NMR was used to study the pH dependence of aggregation states of the PSI. Comparing the 1H-15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) of PSI at pH values from 2.0 to 7.0 showed a single set of cross-peaks at pH 7.0. At pH 2.0, more than 80% of the population of the major state that showed distinct spectral patterns of PSI at pH 7.0 exists, whereas a minor state has a spectral pattern close to that at neutral pH, which suggests the detection of a new state of PSI at pH 2.0. In addition, two sets of cross-peaks were observed at pH values between 2.0 and 7.0 (Fig. 2 and Fig. S1), suggesting the presence of a pH-dependent monomer-dimer equilibrium. To confirm the aggregating states, 15N relaxation parameters were measured at pH values of 2.0 and 7.0. At pH 2.0, the correlation time τc, fitted from the average T1(15N)/T2(15N) ratio of the cross-peaks of the major components, was found to be approximately double that at pH 7.0 (Fig. S2 and supporting Results), which is consistent with the expected increase in molecular tumbling upon dimerization. Thus, these results verify that the PSI experiences a monomer-dimer equilibrium at acidic pH. At pH 2.0, PSI exists primarily as a dimer. The NMR resonance assignments were obtained both for the monomeric PSI at pH 7.0 and the dimeric PSI at pH 2.0 (Fig. 2B and Figs. S3 and S4). The amide cross-peaks of G40 were used as a reference to follow the monomer-dimer equilibrium, because the cross-peaks of G40 corresponding to both species were obtained, with well-resolved resonances. Changes in pH altered the relative intensities of G40 cross-peaks corresponding to the monomeric and the dimeric species, thus allowing for the determination of the pH-dependent monomer-dimer equilibrium (Fig. 1, C and D). The percentages of the dimeric PSI were obtained as a function of pH values, showing that decreasing pH substantially increases the percentage of the dimeric species. A nearly linear correlation was found for the percentage of the dimeric PSI against the pH value. The crystal structure of the dimeric PSI has been reported (9Bryksa B.C. Prasenjit B. Eugenia M. De Moura D.C. Martin K. Alexander Z. Dutcher J.R. Alexander W. Yada R.Y. Structure and mechanism of the saposin-like domain of a plant aspartic protease.J. Biol.

Although our earlier work of CD spectra on PSI indicated the major α-helical structures of PSI in solution, site-specific secondary structure elements of PSI in solution are still unknown. On the other hand, the monomer structure of PSI has not been determined; thus, a study of its secondary structure in solution is needed. The NMR resonance assignments and relaxation analysis allow for the study of the secondary structures under different pH values. Chemical shift index (CSI) analysis from NMR assignments revealed predominantly α-helical structures for both species, which is in agreement with the known PSI crystal structures (21Baldus M. Petkova A.T. Herzfeld J. Griffin R.G. Cross polarization in the tilted frame: assignment and spectral simplification in heteronuclear spin systems.Mol. Phys. 1998; 95: 1197-120710.1080/00268979809483251Crossref Scopus (460) Google Scholar). In solution, a flexible unstructured loop (residues 40–72) connecting helix II and helix III in both species was identified by the CSI and the low 1H-15N NOE values (Figs. S2–S5). Consistently, those segments do not appear in the crystal structure of PSI (PDB entry 3RFI), due to their low electron density, further demonstrating its dynamic nature. Further solution NMR experiments were used to gain additional information regarding PSI-liposome interactions. The PSI-liposome interactions were characterized at pH 2.0, 3.4, 5.4, and 7.0 to determine the nature of PSI-membrane interactions as a function of pH values. The 1H-15N HSQC spectra were collected for the liposome-free PSI and the PSI after the addition of liposomes (Fig. 3). Upon binding of the liposomes, the PSI signals are expected to experience broader line width as being attached to the liposome with a radius of a few hundred nanometers. At pH 5.4 and 7.0, no substantial spectral changes were observed (no cross-peak shifting or line broadening), thus indicating the absence of interactions between PSI and liposomes. In contrast, at pH 2.0 and 3.4, the intensity of most cross-peaks in the 1H-15N HSQC spectra of dimeric PSI was largely reduced in the presence of liposome. The greater breadth in line width of the PSI after the addition of liposomes indicated strong interaction between the PSI with a particle with a much larger size. As both the monomer and the dimers are present at acidic pH values, the disagreement in terms of PSI-liposome binding at pH 3.4 and 5.4 suggests that the formation of the PSI dimer is not sufficient to induce PSI-liposome interactions. The PSI-liposome binding is strongly regulated by the pH, a pH below a critical value needed for PSI-liposome interactions. The decrease in pH neutralizes the negative charges of PSI, thus effectively reducing the repulsive forces between the protein and the negatively charged liposome, leading to effective PSI-liposome binding and membrane fusion. Indeed, the pI of the PSI is also around 4.5, near the critical pH at which PSI induces membrane fusion. It thus confirms the need to neutralize the negative charges on the protein surface to perform membrane-binding and fusion functions. It is commonly accepted that the membrane fusion process involves a dehydration process. Solid-state NMR (SSNMR) is powerful in studying the topology of membrane fusion proteins (22Yao H. Lee M.

This method may also be advantageous in assessing other musculoskeletal tissues. Although SFA has been shown to be a reliable assessment strategy in tendon tissue, its reliability in muscle has not been investigated. The purpose of this study was to examine the reliability of spatial frequency parameter measurement for a large muscle group within a healthy population. Ten participants with no history of lower extremity surgery or hamstring strain injury volunteered. Longitudinal B-mode images were collected in three different locations across the hamstring muscles. Following a short rest, the entire imaging procedure was repeated. B-mode images were processed by manually drawing a region of interest (ROI) about the entire muscle thickness. Four spatial frequency parameters of interest were extracted from the image ROIs. Intra- and inter-rater reliabilities of extracted SFA parameters were performed. Test-retest reliability of the image acquisition procedure was assessed between repeat trials. Intraclass correlation coefficients showed high intra- and inter-rater reliability (ICC(3,1) > 0.9 for all parameters) and good to moderate test-retest reliability (ICC(3,1) > 0.50) between trials. No differences in parameter values were observed between trials across all muscles and locations (p > 0.05). The high reliability metrics suggest that SFA will be useful for future studies assessing muscle tissue structure, and may have value in assessing muscular adaptations following injury and during recovery."
https://openalex.org/W3041818364,"Introduction The fetal cardio-electrohysterographic coupling (FCEC) is defined as the influence of the uterine electrical activity on fetal heart rate. FCEC has been mainly evaluated by visual analysis of cardiotocographic data during labor; however, this physiological phenomenon is poorly explored during the antenatal period. Here we propose an approach known as Bivariate Phase-Rectified Signal Averaging analysis (BPRSA) to assess such FCEC in the late third trimester of low-risk pregnancies. We hypothesized that BPRSA is a more reliable measure of FCEC than visual analysis and conventional measures such as cross-correlation, coherence, and cross-sample entropy. Additionally, by using BPRSA it is possible to detect FCEC even from the third trimester of pregnancy. Material and methods Healthy pregnant women in the last third trimester of pregnancy (36.6 ± 1.8 gestational weeks) without any clinical manifestation of labor were enrolled in the Maternal and Childhood Research Center (CIMIGen), Mexico City (n = 37). Ten minutes of maternal electrohysterogram (EHG) and fetal heart rate (FHR) data were collected by a transabdominal non-invasive device. The FCEC was quantified by the coefficient of coherence, the maximum normalized cross-correlation, and the cross-sample entropy obtained either from the EHG and FHR raw signals or from the corresponding BPRSA graphs. Results We found that by using BPRSA, the FCEC was detected in 92% cases (34/37) compared to 48% cases (18/37) using the coefficient of coherence between the EHG and FHR raw signals. Also, BPRSA indicated FCEC in 82% cases (30/37) compared to 30% cases (11/37) using the maximum normalized cross-correlation. By comparing the analyses, the BPRSA evidenced higher FCEC in comparison to the coupling estimated from the raw EHG and FHR signals. Conclusions Our results support the consideration that in the third trimester of pregnancy, the fetal heart rate is also influenced by uterine activity despite the emerging manifestation of this activity before labor. To quantify FCEC, the BPRSA can be applied to FHR and EHG transabdominal signals acquired in the third trimester of pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W3042042782,"Background The Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement aims to improve clarity and consistency of transparency of reporting in Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs). The Cochrane Risk of Bias (RoB) tool for RCTs helps authors to judge the RoB. as ‘‘low”, “high” or “unclear”. Objective In this study we aimed to assess whether the implementation and updates of the CONSORT statement influenced the trend of “unclear” RoB scores of RCTs included in Cochrane systematic reviews. Methods All Cochrane reviews published in December to October 2016 were retrieved. The publication year of RCTS included in the reviews were sorted into time frames (≤1995, 1996–2000, 2001–2009 and ≥2010) based on the release- and updates of the CONSORT statement (1996, 2001 and 2010). The association between “unclear” RoB versus “low or high” RoB and the year of publication in different time frames were calculated using a binary logistic regression. Results Data was extracted from 64 Cochrane reviews, with 989 RCTS (6471 items). The logistic regression showed that the odds of RCTs published ≥2010, compared to ≤1995 were more likely not to report an “unclear” RoB for the total data (Odds Ratio (OR) 0.69 (95% Confidence interval: 0.59–0.80)), random sequence generation (OR 0.32 (0.22–0.47), allocation concealment (0.64 (0.43–0.95)) and incomplete outcome data (OR 0.60 (0.39–0.91)).

https://openalex.org/W3041527825,"Background The best management of hypertension in frail oldest-old (≥80 years of age) remains unclear and we still lack guidelines that provide specific recommendations. Our study aims to investigate guideline use in general practitioners (GPs) and to examine if guideline use relates to different decisions when managing hypertension in frail oldest-old. Design/Setting Cross-sectional study among currently active GPs from 29 countries using a case-vignettes survey. Methods GPs participated in a survey with case-vignettes of frail oldest-olds varying in systolic blood pressure (SBP) levels and cardiovascular disease (CVD). GPs from 26 European countries and from Brazil, Israel and New Zealand were invited. We compared the percentage of GPs reporting using guidelines per country and further stratified on the most frequently mentioned guidelines. To adjust for patient characteristics (SBP, CVD and GPs’ sex, years of experience, prevalence of oldest-old and location of their practice), we used a mixed-effects regression model accounting for clustering within countries. Results Overall, 2,543 GPs from 29 countries were included. 59.4% of them reported to use guidelines. Higher guideline use was found in female (p = 0.031) and less-experienced GPs (p<0.001). Across countries, we found a large variation in self-reported guideline use, ranging from 25% to 90% of the GPs, but there was no difference in hypertension treatment decisions in frail oldest-old patients between GPs that did not use and GPs that used guidelines, irrespective of the guidelines they used. Conclusion Many GPs reported using guidelines to manage hypertension in frail oldest-old patients, however guideline users did not decide differently from non-users concerning hypertension treatment decisions.

In the MIlkMAN study, we aimed to examine the feasibility and acceptability of milk+RE as an intervention for muscle function in community-dwelling older adults, and provide exploratory pilot data for future substantive research in population at risk of sarcopenia. Methods In a parallel groups design, 30 older adults (71.7±3.6 years; 12 women) were randomised into three groups: WM (whole milk 3.6% fat)+RE, SM (skimmed milk 0.3% fat)+RE, and C (isocaloric carbohydrate drink)+RE. RE was performed twice-weekly over 6 weeks in a community gym, followed by the consumption of 500 ml of milk (~20 g protein) or carbohydrate drink immediately after exercise and a further 500 ml at home within the following 4–5 hours. The feasibility and acceptability of the study was determined by calculating recruitment and attendance rates, compliance with the intervention, rating participants’ experiences, and recording adverse health events. Results The response rate was 49% (out of 400 invitations sent), and the recruitment rate was 73.2% (30 participants recruited out of 41 screened for eligibility). Twenty-nine participants completed the intervention—an attendance rate of 97.1%; 89.7% rated their experience as ‘excellent’/very good’. Compliance with taking the drinks was 97.1% (WM), 98.3% (SM), and 95.0% (C); 93.1% rated their drink intake as ‘easy’/’very easy’ with no adverse effects. Collection of exploratory pilot data to inform future trials was successful. Mean change in grip strength, 5-chair rises, and gait speed were 0.9±3.4 kg, 1.8±2.2 s, 0.1±0.1 m/s, respectively with no differences between the groups. Conclusions This community-based milk+RE intervention was feasible and acceptable to older adults. The study successfully collected pilot data for future substantive research."
https://openalex.org/W3042158113,"Background Treatment with vitamin K antagonists (VKA) requires a high proportion of time in the therapeutic range (TTR) and a low international normalised ratio (INR) variability to be maximally safe and effective. Switching from short-acting acenocoumarol to long-acting phenprocoumon could improve VKA control. Aims We assessed whether switching from acenocoumarol to phenprocoumon improves the time in the therapeutic range (TTR) and INR variability. Methods and results In a retrospective cohort with data on 236,957 patients-years of VKA management from two first-line anticoagulation clinics in the Netherlands, we identified 124 patients in target range 2–3, 269 patients in target range 2–3.5 and 98 patients in target range 2.5–3.5 who switched from acenocoumarol to phenprocoumon. They were matched in a 1:2 ratio to non-switching controls using propensity score matching. Over the first 180 days after a switch, switchers’ TTR declined 5 (95% CI 1 to 10), 10 (95% CI 7 to 13) and 5 (95% CI 0 to 11) percentage points relative to non-switchers, in target ranges 2–3, 2–3.5 and 2.5–3.5. Anticoagulation was more often supra-therapeutic in switchers, and switchers had a higher INR variability. In the following 180 days, TTR in switchers became 1 (95% CI -4 to 6), 4 (95% CI 0 to 7) and 6 (95% CI 1 to 12) percentage points better than in non-switchers. Switchers’ INRs were much more stable than non-switchers’. Conclusion Eventually, a switch from acenocoumarol to phenprocoumon leads to a higher TTR and a lower INR variability. However, this is preceded by a transition period with opposite effects. An improved conversion algorithm could possibly shorten the transition period. Until then, physicians and patients should decide whether switching is worth the increased risk during the transition phase."
https://openalex.org/W3041210326,"Episodic memory refers to the recollection of previous experiences containing specific temporal, spatial, and emotional information. The ability to recollect episodic memory requires coordination of multiple brain regions, including the hippocampus (HPC) and the cingulate cortex. While the afferents into HPC and cingulate cortex that orchestrate the episodic memory remain unclear. The medial septum (MS), one of the anatomical location of cholinergic centers, innervates not only the dorsal HPC (dHPC), but also the cingulate and entorhinal cortices. By using “What-Where-When” episodic-like memory (ELM) behavioral model and viral tracing, we found that MS neurons projected to dHPC and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), which exerted distinct impacts on ELM recollection. Chemogenetic inhibition of the dHPC-projecting MS neurons disrupted “What-Where-When” ELM recollection as well as object location, object-in-place, and recency recognition memories recollection, while chemogenetic inhibition of the ACC-projecting MS neurons only disrupted “What-Where-When” ELM recollection. Moreover, neither dHPC- nor ACC-projecting MS neurons were involved in novel object recognition memory recollection or locomotor activity. Immunostaining showed that ACC- and dHPC-projecting MS neurons are partially overlapped populations. These findings reveal an unsuspected division of ELM processing and provide the potential mechanism that the recollection of episodic memory need the coordination of MS neurons projecting to dHPC and ACC."

The main pilus subunit FimA from type 1 piliated, enteroinvasive pathogens (E. coli FimA: 159 residues, 15.8 kDa) differs from all other pilus subunits in that it possesses two alternative folding possibilities: (i) it can assemble to the helical, homopolymeric pilus rod (16Hahn E.

These alternative folding possibilities become possible due to a pseudo-palindromic sequence in the Nte of FimA (…Gly8-Z-X-His11-X-Z-Gly14… in E. coli FimA), with His11 in the center of the palindrome, where X is a hydrophobic residue and Z is a hydrophilic/charged residue (…Gly8-Thr9-Val10-His11-Phe12-Lys13-Gly14…). The solved three-dimensional structures of both E. coli FimA conformers showed that the residues Gly8 and Gly14, which occupy the shallow P4 pocket in the FimA monomer and the FimA polymer, respectively, define the register of the inserted Nte β-strand. The P4 pocket is so shallow that it can only accommodate a glycine residue without disturbing the main-chain β-sheet hydrogen-bonding network between the inserted Nte and the neighboring strands A and F of the FimA fold (Fig. 1B) (10Żyła D.S.

The vast majority of the FimA molecules secreted into the E. coli periplasm bind to the assembly chaperone FimC, fold when bound to FimC, and are delivered as FimA-FimC complexes to the assembly platform FimD. However, a small fraction of the FimA molecules appears to fold independently of FimC to soluble monomers. These FimA monomers act as inhibitors of apoptosis of urinary epithelium cells after type 1 pilus-mediated UPEC internalization. This mechanism may enable UPEC strains to escape antibiotic treatment during urinary tract infections inside the host cells (18Sukumaran S.K. Fu N.Y. Tin C.B. Wan K.F. Lee S.S. Yu V.C.

The two alternative modes of Nte insertion into the FimA fold have dramatic consequences for folding and thermodynamic stability of FimA. Guanidinium chloride (GdmCl)-induced unfolding/refolding equilibria showed that the self-complemented E. coli FimA monomer exhibits only marginal thermodynamic stability. Unfolding/refolding equilibria of the E. coli FimA monomer were attained after 1 day of incubation and revealed free energy of folding of only –5.5 kJ/mol at pH 7.0 and 25 °C (10Żyła D.S. Prota A.E.

In contrast, a self-complemented FimA variant (FimAa), mimicking the state of FimA in the assembled pilus rod, proved to be extremely stable, with a free energy of folding of –66.5 kJ/mol (10Żyła D.S.

In FimAa, a second copy of the 19-residue Nte sequence was fused to the FimA C terminus via a hexaglycine linker. This C-terminal Nte inserts in the antiparallel orientation into the FimA fold, whereas the natural Nte at the N terminus stays flexibly disordered (Fig. 1, C and D). In addition, FimAa showed very high activation energy barriers for unfolding and refolding so that the folding equilibrium could never be attained at 25 °C. Specifically, the unfolding of FimAa after incubation for 1 day could only be observed at GdmCl concentrations above 5 m, whereas refolding could only be detected below 1 m GdmCl. Nevertheless, global fits of the unfolding and refolding transitions of FimAa, recorded after different incubation times (1–30 days), proved to be fully consistent with the two-state model of folding. These results showed that the extraordinary stability of FimA in the context of the assembled pilus is based on its essentially infinite stability against unfolding/dissociation under physiological conditions, as the extrapolated t½ of spontaneous FimAa unfolding at pH 7.0, 25 °C, and zero GdmCl proved to be in the range of 100 million years (10Żyła D.S. Prota A.E. Capitani G. Glockshuber R. Alternative folding to a monomer or homopolymer is a common feature of the type 1 pilus subunit FimA from enteroinvasive bacteria.J. Biol.

In the present study, we addressed the question of whether the extraordinary stability of FimA with the Nte inserted in the antiparallel orientation (intramolecular in FimAa, intermolecular in FimA/FimA contacts in the pilus rod) primarily originates from antiparallel β-strand insertion or from specific interactions between the Nte side chains of the Nte pseudo-palindrome in the binding pockets P1–P5. For this purpose, we compared the stability of FimA and FimAa with that of two analogous FimA variants, FimA Nrev and FimA Crev, in which the entire Nte sequence was reversed (Fig. 1, D and E and Fig. S1). In FimA Nrev, the sequence of the first 19 FimA residues was reversed relative to WT FimA. In the variant FimA Crev, the reversed Nte sequence was fused to the C terminus via a hexaglycine linker, and the natural Nte was deleted. We demonstrate that the two characteristic features of FimA in the context of the pilus rod, extraordinary stability against unfolding and unattainable folding equilibria under physiological conditions, are mainly governed by the identity of the Nte side chains inserting in the P1–P5 pockets of the FimA fold. All FimA variants were produced in the E. coli cytoplasm under the control of the T7 promoter without the natural FimA signal sequence. Due to the reducing conditions in the cytoplasm, all variants were unable to form the conserved structural disulfide bond and accumulated as insoluble inclusion bodies. As described previously for FimA and FimAa, precipitated FimA Nrev and FimA Crev were solubilized by 6 m GdmCl (10Żyła D.S. Prota A.E. Capitani G. Glockshuber R. Alternative folding to a monomer or homopolymer is a common feature of the type 1 pilus subunit FimA from enteroinvasive bacteria.J. Biol.

After the formation of the structural disulfide bond by Cu2+-catalyzed air oxidation in the presence of denaturant, the variants were refolded by removal of the denaturant through dialysis. Refolded proteins were concentrated and purified by gel filtration on Superdex 75 columns, in which they eluted at the retention volume corresponding to the folded FimA monomer. The average yield of purified FimA variants was about 35 mg/liter of bacterial culture. MS confirmed that the N-terminal methionine had been cleaved in all FimA variants. In a first experiment to probe the stability of FimA WT relative to that of FimA Nrev and of FimAa relative to that of FimA Crev, we recorded thermal unfolding transitions of all proteins at pH 7.0 via the loss of the native far-UV CD signal at 230 nm. Reversal of the Nte in FimA monomers (parallel orientation) caused a strong stabilization in the FimA Nrev variant, with an increase in the apparent melting temperature (Tm) by 17 °C, from 49 (FimA WT) to 66 °C (FimA Nrev) (Fig. 2). An analogous result was obtained for the reversal of the donor strand sequence attached to the C terminus of FimA (antiparallel orientation): whereas FimAa showed extraordinary stability with an apparent Tm of 95 °C, the Tm of the protein dropped to 49 °C in the variant FimA Crev (i.e. the Tm observed for the FimA WT monomer) (Fig. 2). Together, the thermal unfolding data indicated that the Nte residues inserting into the P1–P5 pockets of the pilin fold of FimA are critical determinants for the stability of donor strand–complemented FimA and that the antiparallel donor strand orientation alone is not sufficient to explain the extraordinary stability of FimA subunits in the assembled pilus. Next, we measured GdmCl-dependent unfolding and refolding transitions at pH 7.0 and 25 °C of FimA Nrev and FimA Crev. Fig. 3A shows that FimA Crev, similar to the FimA WT monomer, attained its folding equilibrium after incubation for 1 day. Like FimA, FimA Crev proved to be only marginally stable, with a free energy of folding (ΔG0) of –6.9 ± 1.8 kJ/mol. This value is identical within experimental error to the previously reported stability of FimA WT monomers (–5.5 ± 0.5 kJ/mol) under exactly the same conditions (Table 1, Table 2).

Open table in a new tab As observed previously for FimAa, the unfolding/refolding transitions (recorded after 1 and 8 days of incubation) of FimA Nrev differed drastically from those observed for FimA and FimA Crev. Specifically, even after incubation for 8 days, the folding equilibrium of FimA Nrev could not be attained, because unfolding could only be observed at high and refolding only at low denaturant concentrations (Fig. 3B). The global analysis of all unfolding and refolding transitions proved to be fully consistent with a kinetically unattained two-state equilibrium with a very high activation energy barrier for unfolding and refolding. Fig. 3C shows the logarithm of the observed rate constant (kobs) of equilibrium attainment (kobs = kF + kU) dependence on the denaturant concentration deduced from the nonequilibrium data in Fig. 3B, which allowed calculating the free energy of folding (ΔG0) and the rate constants of folding and unfolding at zero denaturant of FimA Nrev (Table 1, Table 2). The obtained ΔG0 value of –31.5 ± 1.3 kJ/mol shows that FimA Nrev is 26 kJ/mol (∼5 times) more stable than the FimA WT monomer. As FimA WT and FimA Nrev show the same (parallel) donor strand orientation and only differ in their reversed Nte sequences, the results clearly demonstrate that essentially only the Nte residues interacting with the pockets P1–P5 of the FimA pilin fold determine the characteristic features of FimA subunits in the assembled pilus rod: extraordinary thermodynamic stability and extreme kinetic stability against unfolding and dissociation (Table 1, Table 2). We previously showed that the E. coli FimA WT monomer and FimAa variant spontaneously refold very slowly and with very similar half-lives of about 2 h (10Żyła D.S. Prota A.E. Capitani G.

This predicted that the FimA variants FimA Nrev and FimA Crev also fold slowly with similar rates. To test this hypothesis, we recorded the refolding kinetics at pH 7.0 and 25 °C of FimA Nrev, FimA Crev, FimA, and FimAa under the same conditions (50 mm final GdmCl concentration after rapid dilution with refolding buffer). Indeed, all FimA variants refolded with essentially the same kinetics (half-lives between 1.6 and 2.6 h), indicating that the transition states of folding are very similar for the four FimA variants (Fig. 4). For the FimAa and FimA Nrev variants, which did not attain folding equilibrium at 25 °C (Table 1, Table 2), the measured half-lives of folding in 50 mm GdmCl (Fig. 4, B and D, respectively) agreed well (within a factor of 2) with those predicted from their nonequilibrium transitions for folding at the same GdmCl concentration (Fig. 3). The data are consistent with a model in which the transition state of FimA folding is only formed by the residues 20–159 of the FimA fold (see Fig. 1) (14Puorger C. Vetsch M. Wider G. Glockshuber R. Structure, folding and stability of FimA, the main structural subunit of type 1 pili from uropathogenic Escherichia coli strains.J. Mol. Biol. 2011; 412 (21816158): 520-53510.1016/j.jmb.2011.07.044Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Segment 20–159 is the same in all FimA variants investigated. In addition, the fact that neither the orientation of the β-strand that complements the FimA fold nor its sequence influences the FimA folding kinetics explains why all variants fold with essentially the same kinetics although their thermodynamic stabilities are dramatically different. To test whether the reversed sequences of the N- and C-terminal extensions in the FimA Nrev and FimA Crev constructs indeed inserted as predicted into the FimA fold, we solved the X-ray structures of both variants at 1.8 and 1.5 Å, respectively, by molecular replacement using the X-ray structure of FimA (PDB entry 5NKT) as a search model (Fig. 5 and Table 3). Superposition of the Cα carbon traces of FimA and FimA Nrev and of FimAa and FimA Crev showed that the sequence reversal of the N- and C-terminal extension, respectively, could be very well accommodated by the immunoglobulin-like FimA fold (Cα RMSD values of 0.24 and 0.98 Å, respectively; see Fig. S3 for the local per residue RMSD values in the donor strand regions). As predicted, the register of β-strand insertion of the reversed Nte/Cte segments remained unchanged and dictated by the glycine residues occupying the P1 and P4 pockets of the FimA fold (Fig. S3, left panels). In addition, the structures of all four FimA variants demonstrated that both the P2 and P3 pocket can accommodate either valine or phenylalanine side chain, independently of the orientation of the donor strand. Despite the dramatic differences in thermodynamic stability between FimA and FimA Nrev and between FimAa and FimA Crev (Table 1, Table 2), we could not find specific structural parameters that could directly explain these large stability differences (Table S2). The only peculiarity in the more stable structures FimAa and FimA Nrev was that their oppositely oriented donor strands aligned well over a wider range of residues compared with the oppositely oriented donor strands in the less stable variants FimA and FimA Crev (Fig. S3F). Specifically, the Cα RMSD values remained below 3 Å within a contiguous 12-residue segment of the donor strand (positions 2–13 of WT FimA) in the FimAa/FimA Nrev pair (Fig. S3F), whereas only seven contiguous donor stand residues (positions 8–14 of WT FimA) showed Cα RMSD values below 3 Å in the FimA/FimA Crev pair (Fig. S3E). Table 1, Table 2 and Fig. 4 demonstrate that all four FimA variants fold according to the two-state model and that differences in thermodynamic stability exclusively originate from huge differences in the rate constants of unfolding. The two-state folding predicts that all interactions stabilizing the native state are broken simultaneously upon unfolding. Thus, even small local structural changes could strongly influence the highly cooperative unfolding reaction when they have short- and long-range effects on neighboring native interactions.Table 3X-ray data collection and refinement statistics for the crysta"

The trial evaluated the efficacy of INF relative to IVH for treating cancer patients with severe pain in an emergency department (ED) setting.We randomized 82 patients from a comprehensive cancer center ED to receive INF (n = 42) or IVH (n = 40). Eligible patients reported severe pain at randomization (≥7, scale: 0 ""none"" to 10 ""worst pain""). We conducted non-inferiority comparisons (non-inferiority margin = 0.9) of pain change from treatment initiation (T0) to one hour later (T60). T0 pain ratings were unavailable; therefore, we estimated T0 pain by comparing 1) T60 ratings, assuming similar group T0 ratings; 2) pain change, estimating T0 pain = randomization ratings, and 3) pain change, with T0 pain = 10 (IVH group) or T0 pain = randomization rating (INF group).At T60, the upper 90% confidence limit (CL) of the mean log-transformed pain ratings for the INF group exceeded the mean IVH group rating by 0.16 points (>pain). Substituting randomization ratings for T0 pain, the lower 90% CL of mean pain change in the INF group extended 0.32 points below (<pain relief) mean change in the IVH group. Finally, assuming all subjects in the IVH group had maximum pain at T0 and that T0 pain for the INF group remained unchanged from randomization, the lower bound of the 90% CL for mean pain decrease in the INF group extended 1.37 points below (<pain relief) mean decrease in the IVH group. Time (minutes) from randomization until T0 was longer for the IVH (Median 23, IQR 12) versus INF (Median 15, IQR 11) group (P<0.001).Two of three analyses supported non-inferiority of INF versus IVH, while one analysis was inconclusive. Compared to IVH, INF had the advantage of shorter time to administration.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02459964."
https://openalex.org/W3041626617,"Although unintended acceleration caused by pedal misapplication is a cause of traffic accidents, fatal accidents may be avoided if drivers realize their error immediately and quickly correct how they are stepping on the pedal. This correction behavior may decline with age because the rate of fatal accidents is fairly higher for older adults than for younger adults. To investigate this possibility, the present study recruited older adults (n = 40, age range = 67-81 years) as well as younger adults (n = 40, age range = 18-32 years). In this study, they performed a pedal stepping task during which they were required to stop the simulated vehicle as quickly as possible when a red signal was presented on a monitor. During most trials, the vehicle decelerated/stopped when the brake pedal was applied in a normal manner. In a few trials, however, stepping on the brake pedal resulted in sudden acceleration of the vehicle (i.e., the occurrence of the unintended acceleration); when this occurred, the participants had to release the pedal and re-step on another pedal to decelerate/stop the vehicle as quickly as possible. We focused on the age-related differences of the reaction latencies during three time periods: from the appearance of the red signal on the screen until stepping on the pedal (Period 1), from stepping on the pedal until the release of the pedal (Period 2), and from the release of the pedal until re-stepping of another pedal (Period 3). The results showed that there was no age-related difference in the latency of Period 1, p = .771, whereas those of Periods 2 and 3 were longer for the older adults (ps < .001). The results suggest that there are age-related differences in error detection and correction abilities under unintended situations with foot pedal manipulation."

https://openalex.org/W3040703895,"Muscle ultrasound density (MUD) is a non-invasive parameter to indicate neuromuscular integrity in both children and adults. In healthy fetuses and infants, physiologic MUD values during development are still lacking. We therefore aimed to determine the physiologic, age-related MUD trend of biceps, quadriceps, tibialis anterior, hamstrings, gluteal and calf muscles, from pre- to the first year of postnatal life. To avoid a bias by pregnancy-related signal disturbances, we expressed fetal MUD as a ratio against bone ultrasound density. We used the full-term prenatal MUD ratio and the newborn postnatal MUD value as reference points, so that MUD development could be quantified from early pre- into postnatal life. Results: During the prenatal period, the total muscle group revealed a developmental MUD trend concerning a fetal increase in MUD-ratio from the 2nd trimester up to the end of the 3rd trimester [median increase: 27% (range 16–45), p < .001]. After birth, MUD-values increased up to the sixth month [median increase: 11% (range -7-27), p = 0.025] and stabilized thereafter. Additionally, there were also individual MUD characteristics per muscle group and developmental stage, such as relatively low MUD values of fetal hamstrings and high values of the paediatric gluteus muscles. These MUD trends are likely to concur with analogous developmentally, maturation-related alterations in the muscle water to peptide content ratios."
