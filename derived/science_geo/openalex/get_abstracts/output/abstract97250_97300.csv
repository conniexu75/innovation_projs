https://openalex.org/W1558134787,"Two classes of oligosaccharides were identified in alkaline borohydride digests of monomer proteoglycans from the Swarm rat chondrosarcoma. The first class consists of three similar oligomers, each of which is linked to the proteoglycan core proteins by an O-glycosidic bond between N-acetylgalactosamine and hydroxyl groups on serine and threonine. The structures of the two smallest oligosaccharides are: (formula: see text). Proteoglycan monomers from the chondrosarcoma contain about 1.3 of these oligosaccharides for every chondroitin sulfate chain. Their structures and distribution on the core protein suggest that they are related to the linkage region between keratan sulfate chains and the core protein of cartilage proteoglycans. The second class of oligomers consists of oligosaccharide-peptides that contain mannose and are probably linked to the core protein by N-glycosylamine bonds to asparagine. There appear to be about 15 of these oligosaccharides/ proteoglycan molecule, and they are primarily located on the core protein nearer to the hyaluronic acid-binding site than both the oligosaccharides linked by O-glycoside bonds and the chondroitin sulfate chains. Chondrocytes isolated from the chondrosarcoma and grown in culture synthesize both classes of oligosaccharides."

To investigate the biosynthesis of the oligosaccharides of a lysosomal enzyme, mouse lymphoma cells were labeled for 3 h with [Z3H]mannose, and the lysosomal enzyme P-glucuronidase was purified by immunoprecipitation. Oligosaccharides were prepared by sequential pronase and endo-P-N-acetylglucosaminidase H digestions of the immunoprecipitate. Approximately 50% of the [3H]mannose-labeled oligosaccharides contained a net negative charge as determined by binding to quaternary aminoethyl (QAE)-Sephadex and were either entirely or partially resistant to jack bean a-mannosidase digestion. Most of these charged oligosaccharides were unaffected by incubation with alkaline phosphatase, but upon treatment with 0.01 N to 0.1 N HCl at 100°C for 30 min, the oligosaccharides became more negatively charged and were now sensitive to alkaline phosphatase. The phosphate residues were also partially exposed by a-N-acetylglucosaminidase treatment, indicating that at least some of the blocking moieties were a-N-acetylglucosamine residues. This was confirmed by showing that a phosphorylated high mannose-type oligosaccharide from cells metabolically labeled with [6-3H]glucose contained N-acetylglucosamine residues which were releasable by mild acid treatment. The neutral oligosaccharides resulting from sequential mild acid and alkaline phosphatase treatment migrated as high mannose-type oligosaccharides on paper chromatography and were now fully degraded by a-mannosidase. These data suggest that the 3 h [3H]mannose"
https://openalex.org/W5422004,"Human a-thrombin was modified by four different procedures to identify specific active site regions required for receptor binding and stimulation of cell division. Conjugation of a-thrombin with diisopropylphosphofluoridate (DIP-F) or methylsulfonyl fluoride (MS-F) yielded catalytically inactivated preparations. Nitration or limited proteolysis of a-thrombin led to nitro-a-thrombin or y-thrombin preparations, respectively. Both possessed very little clotting activity but retained significant esterase activity; they were modified at regions necessary for the binding recognition of fibrinogen. Measurements of specific binding of these modified thrombins to cultured mouse, hamster, chicken, and human fibroblasts revealed no significant binding of nitro-a-thrombin or y-thrombin. Thus, binding of athrombin to each of the cell types examined involved regions of a-thrombin distinct from the catalytic apparatus that are related, if not identical, to regions required for fibrinogen recognition. Binding experiments with catalytic site-conjugated DIPor MS-athrombins revealed significant differences in the athrombin receptor among the four cell types; these thrombin forms bound as effectively as a-thrombin to mouse and hamster cells, but did not bind significantly to chick or human cells. Thus, thrombin binding to chick and human cells required the thrombin catalytic apparatus or adjacent active site regions, whereas binding to mouse or hamster cells did not. The four cell types examined all responded to the mitogenic action of a-thrombin. However, the derivative thrombin forms did not stimulate division of any of the cells significantly, with the exception of nitro-athrombin which possessed some residual activity for mouse cells. Since enzymatically inactive DIPand MSa-thrombins bound to mouse and hamster cells as effectively as active a-thrombin, the mitogenic activity of a-thrombin on these cells requires the intact catalytic apparatus of the enzyme to interact with and presumably cleave a specific protein component."
https://openalex.org/W1571361255,"A rapid filtration technique was used to analyze the kinetics of the binding reaction between glyceraldehyde-3-P dehydrogenase and the band 3 protein of the human erythrocyte membrane. Saponin was used to eliminate the membrane as a rate-limiting barrier. The re-equilibration of the enzyme following dilution of membranes in buffer took only a few seconds. Dissociation rates were greatly stimulated and association rates were reduced by increasing ionic strength. A Bronsted-Bjerrum analysis suggested that two or three charges of opposite sign on each protein were involved in binding. NADH appeared to elute the enzyme by interaction with its catalytic site, but the band 3 binding site extended beyond the NADH site, permitting the formation of a ternary NADH . enzyme . membrane complex. The release of the enzyme from fresh erythrocytes immediately following saponin lysis showed kinetics similar to the release of enzyme from ghosts. The extrapolated zero time intercepts of these reactions suggested that two-thirds of cellular glyceraldehyde-3-P dehydrogenase was membrane bound prior to hemolysis. This value is similar to that calculated for the association of the enzyme with band 3 in the intact red cell when the high ionic strength and enzyme-eluting compounds in the cytoplasm are taken into account."

https://openalex.org/W1562006119,"The biosynthesis of cholecystokinin (CCK) in the cerebral cortex of rats was studied by intracisternal pulse injections of [35S]methionine. The rats were killed with intervals varying from 15 min to 10 h after the injections. Cortical CCK extracted in boiling water and acetic acid was immunoabsorbed using an antiserum specific for the COOH-terminal sequence of CCK. After displacement from the immunoabsorbent by heptadecapeptide gastrin, which contains the same COOH-terminal sequence as CCK, chromatography on Sephadex G-50 columns showed four molecular forms of CCK with elution constants (Kav) of 0.08, 0.50 (corresponding to the tritriacontapeptide amide, CCK-33), 1.10 (corresponding to the COOH-terminal octapeptide amide, CCK-8) and 1.40 (a component which may correspond to the COOH-terminal tetrapeptide of rat CCK). Chasing with methionine demonstrated a biosynthetic pathway from the largest molecular form to the octapeptide-like form. The results indicate that a rapid and extensive synthesis of CCK takes place in the cerebral cortex, and that a precursor relationship exists between CCK-8 and the larger molecular forms of CCK."
https://openalex.org/W1531306901,"Human fibroblasts are shown to incorporate [3H]-mevalonolactone into 3H-labeled delta 2-isopentenyl tRNA. This incorporation was observed in cells that were incubated with compactin (ML-236B), an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme. A reductase that blocks mevalonate production by cells. When incubated with low concentrations of [3H]mevalonolactone in the presence of compactin and in the absence of exogenous cholesterol, the cells incorporated small amounts of [3H]mevalonolactone into delta 2-isopentenyl tRNA and large amounts into cholesterol. In the presence of low density lipoprotein, which serves as a source of cholesterol, the incorporation of [3H]mevalonolactone into cholesterol was reduced by 90% and the incorporation into delta 2-isopentenyl tRNA was stimulated by 10-fold. Thus, cultured mammalian cells are now known to use mevalonate for synthesis of three nonsterol products, ubiquinone, dolichol, and delta 2-isopentenyl tRNA, as well as for synthesis of cholesterol."
https://openalex.org/W1578899750,"The effect of membrane potential on the Na+-Ca2+ exchange activity of isolated sarcolemmal vesicles from dog ventricles is examined. Na+-Ca2+ exchange is monitored as Nai+-dependent Ca2+ uptake as described by Reeves and Sutko ((1979) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 76,590-594). Membrane potential is controlled by varying internal and external K+ in the presence of valinomycin. Inside-positive potentials stimulate Nai+-dependent Ca2+ influx. This stimulation is independent of Ca2+ concentration. The results indicate that Na+-Ca2+ exchange by itself can generate a substantial potential (approximately -60mV) in the sarcolemmal vesicles. The data are consistent with an electrogenic Na+-Ca2+ exchange mechanism in which three or more Na+ are exchanged for one Ca2+. This electrogenic exchange may have important implications in the control of myocardial tension development."
https://openalex.org/W1559187524,"The purpose of these experiments was to evaluate the hypothesis that galactose residues on IgG mediate the clearance of IgG.antigen complexes from the circulation. After 28 days of immunization of rats with bovine serum albumin (BSA), approximately 90% of anti-BSA antibody was IgG; the circulating half-life of trace amounts of BSA antigen in immunized rats was 6 min, compared to 24 h in nonimmunized rats. Similarly, soluble IgG.125I-BSA complexes formed in vitro, under conditions of antibody excess, had a circulating half-life of 4 min in normal rats. For both antigen in immunized rats, or IgG.125I-BSA complexes in normal animals, clearance was markedly inhibited by pre- or co-injection of asialofetuin, but was insensitive to large doses of fetuin, ovalbumin, or mannan. Liver parenchymal cells were the major site of uptake of complexes formed in vivo or in vitro. In vitro binding of IgG.125I-BSA complexes by isolated hepatocytes was effectively competed by asialofetuin, asialo-orosomucoid, galactose, and N-acetylgalactosamine, but was unaffected by fetuin, orosomucoid, ovalbumin, mannan, or mannose. These data suggest that antigen-induced conformational changes in IgG result in both recognition of galactose residues on IgG and clearance of IgG-immune complexes from the circulation by the galactose-specific receptor in hepatic parenchymal cells."

https://openalex.org/W1546926303,"Abstract The proton permeability of rabbit skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles was investigated by means of membrane potential measurements. Diffusion potentials were generated in sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles, rat liver microsomes, and sarcoplasmic reticulum phospholipid vesicles by transferring vesicles from low to high pH. Potentials were measured using the voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye 3,3'-dipentyl-2,2'-oxacarbocyanine. Diffusion potentials were generated readily in sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles using H+ gradients. Generation of a similar potential in phospholipid vesicles or liver microsomes required the presence of an uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation. H+ and K+ gradient competition experiments indicated that both K+,Na+-permeable and -impermeable sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles were permeable to H+. These studies suggested that a mechanism of H+ transport exists in sarcoplasmic reticulum that is independent of the K,Na channel, and that transient or steady state membrane potentials may be effected by the movement of H+."

https://openalex.org/W1532130554,"Pineal indoleamine N-acetyltransferase activity in homogenates is rapidly reduced at pH 6.8 by treatment with cystamine or arginine vasotocin. Other disulfides including glutathione disulfide, penicillamine disulfide, and N,N'-diacetylcystamine are either ineffective or less effective. The diamine analogous to cystamine, diaminohexane, is also ineffective. Inactivation by cystamine is accelerated at higher pH and is temperature- and time-dependent. It was also found that cystamine treatment inactivated N-acetyltransferase in intact pineal cells. Treatment with dithiothreitol reactivated the cystamine- or arginine vasotocin-inactivated enzyme formed in broken cell preparations and the cystamine-inactivated enzyme formed in intact cells. These observations indicate that pineal N-acetyltransferase can be inactivated by protein thiol:disulfide exchange; further research is required to ascertain whether this mechanism is of physiological significance."
https://openalex.org/W1577080264,"High field proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to investigate the electronic and molecular structure of the ferric heme in the resting state of horseradish peroxidase. Deuterium labeling of selected positions of hemin and deuterohemin which were subsequently reconstituted into apo-horseradish peroxidase yielded hyperfine shift patterns for the prosthetic group which are consistent with a ferric porphyrin exhibiting appreciable S = 3/2 character in a quantum mixed spin state. All resolved resonances with significant hyperfine shifts can be accounted for by the porphyrin and a proximal histidyl imidazole, although a sixth ligand from the protein cannot be definitely eliminated. The extremely slow exchange rate with bulk water of the proximal histidyl imidazole exchangeable proton and the absence of deviations from Curie behavior for the porphyrin vinyl and propionic acid proton hyperfine shifts indicate a buried heme crevice which is more rigid than in metmyoglobin. The observation of significant deviations from Curie behavior of the proximal histidyl imidazole exchangeable proton in horseradish peroxidase but not in metmyoglobins is suggested to arise from strong hydrogen bonding between the coordinated imidazole and some unspecified protein acceptor residue in the former protein."
https://openalex.org/W1517367350,"Cyanogen bromide treatment of reduced, S-carboxymethylated phosphoglycerate kinase yielded 14 major peptides, CNBr-1 (20 residues), CNBr-2 (8 residues), CNBr-3 (33 residues), CNBr-4 (11 residues), CNBr-5 (104 residues), CNBr-6 (14 residues), CNBr-7 (37 residues), CNBr-8 (7 residues), CNBr-9 (6 residues), CNBr-10 (11 residues), CNBr-11 (19 residues), CNBr-12 (42 residues), CNBr-13 (44 residues), and CNBr-14 (61 residues). The amino acid sequences of all the cyanogen bromide peptides were determined by a combination of automated and manual sequence analysis, and the characterization of tryptic and chymotryptic peptides and peptides obtained by digestion with staphylococcal protease. Two tryptic peptides which were not obtained by direct digestion of whole phosphoglycerate kinase were recovered from cyanogen bromide Peptides CNBr-13 and CNBr-14 and these peptides were purified and sequenced. Based on the information from all the tryptic and cyanogen bromide peptides derived from the enzyme, the proper alignment of these peptides was made. Thus, complete amino acid sequence of human phosphoglycerate kinase consisting of 417 amino acid residues was determined."

https://openalex.org/W70323815,"Cells can respond to s ta rva t ion for a single amino acid with various physiological changes, including inhibition of protein synthesis and stimulation of protein degradation. I n bacteria, these responses depend on the accumulation of deacylated tRNA, and can be mimicked by inhibitors or mutations affecting aminoacyltRNA synthetases. We now have evidence for the existence of a similar relationship in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells. Protein synthesis was measured by incorporation of ~-[4,5-~H]leucine; degradation by the release of acid-soluble radioactivity f rom cells labeled for 24 h with ~-[l-‘~C]leucine. During both measurements, serum was absent and leucine was present at 0.8 mM, at which concentrat ion more than 95% of the leucine used for synthesis i s derived Erom the culture medium. The effect of histidine starvation of increasing severity was studied at 33°C in wild type and two cell l ines in which mutations of hist idyl-tRNA synthetase result in increased requirements of histidine for protein synthesis. We found a correlation between the degree of inhibition of protein synthesis and the degree of stimulation of protein degradation, al though mutants and wild type showed very different dependence of these two processes on histidine. The effects of histidine starvation were mimicked by histidinol, a competitive inhibitor of the synthetase. Maximum stimulation of degradation was obtained wi th a degree of histidine starvation or ratios of histidinol to histidine resulting in about 50% inhibition of synthesis. The maximum degradation rate obtained with histidine starvation could not be fur ther increased by t rea tment with histidinol. Inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide did not st imulate degradation. These results are consistent with a functional connection between the aminoacylation of tRNA and the regulation of protein degradation in mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W1570003935,"The content of decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine in rat tissues was found to be of the order of 0.9 to 2.5 nmol/g wet weight, about 2 to 4% of the content of S-adenosylmethionine. Three methods were used for determinations: separation by high pressure liquid chromatography followed by quantitation using UV absorbance, separation by paper electrophoresis after labeling with radioactive methionine to get the ratio of S-adenosylmethionine to decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine, and separation by electrophoresis followed by elution and assay by an isotope dilution technique using spermidine synthase. The three methods gave comparable results, although the labeling with methionine appeared to slightly overestimate levels in the liver. Hepatic decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine content was reduced by more than 90% for at least 8 h by treatment with methylglyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone), a potent reversible inhibitor of S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase, but had returned to control levels by 24 h. The related irreversible inhibitor, 1,1'-[(methylethanediylidene)-dinitrilo]bis(3-aminoguanidine), reduced levels slightly less to about 20% of control, but maintained them at this value for 2 days."
https://openalex.org/W1487879219,"The 8-hydroxy-5-deazaflavin-dependent NADP+ reductase component of the formate NADP+ oxidoreductase system of Methanococcus vannielii has been purified to homogeneity. The enzyme is specific for NADP+ and 8-hydroxy-5-deazaflavin. It catalyzes the reaction: 1,5-Dihydro-8-hydroxy-5-deazaflavin anion + NADP+ in equilibrium 8-hydroxy-5-deazaflavin + NADPH. The apparent molecular weight of the native enzyme is 85,000. A subunit molecular weight of 43,000 determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis indicates that the native enzyme is a dimer. The optimal temperature for catalytic activity is 17-20 degrees C and the pH maxima are 7.9 and 4.8 for the forward and reverse reactions, respectively. The kcat value of the forward reaction is 24 times greater than that of the reverse reaction, thus the production of NADPH at pH 7.0 is more favorable than its consumption. The reductase contains one or more sulfhydryl groups which are essential for catalytic activity."
https://openalex.org/W1564189686,"The action of the sulfhydryl reagents, o-iodosobenzoate and 2,2’-dithiobis(5-nitropyridine), on photophosphorylation by spinach chloroplast thylakoids has been reevaluated. Both of these compounds were previously reported to be energy transfer inhibitors of photophosphorylation, provided the thylakoids were illuminated in their presence prior to assay. We show here that the treatment of thylakoids in the light with iodosobenzoate uncouples phosphorylation from electron flow. This treatment enhances nonphosphorylating electron transport and markedly decreases the efficiency of photophosphorylation. The light-induced transmembrane pH gradient is also diminished by exposure of thylakoids to iodosobenzoate in the light. Dithiobisnitropyridine has been found to act either as a light-dependent uncoupler or energy transfer inhibitor. At low concentrations of this reagent, illumination elicits uncoupling, whereas at higher concentrations, energy transfer inhibition is induced. The uncoupling by iodosobenzoate and by low concentrations of dithiobisnitropyridine is largely prevented by the prior incubation of thylakoids with N-ethylmaleimide in the dark. Under these conditions, N-ethylmaleimide was previously shown to react with a group on the y subunit and with a group on the E subunit of coupling factor 1. The effects of these sulfhydryl reagents on photophosphorylation are compared to those of maleimides, and a model for the inhibition of phosphorylation by these reagents is proposed. Cross-linking two sufhydryl groups within the y subunit of coupling factor 1, either directly by disulfide bond formation or by bifunctional maleimides, causes thylakoids to become proton-leaky and phosphorylation is uncoupled from electron flow. In contrast, modification of a sulfhydryl, which becomes exposed only in the light, by monofunctional reagents elicits energy transfer inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W1568275216,"The polypeptide, lipid, and carbohydrate components of the lipovitellin complex from anostracan crustacean, Artemia salina, have been investigated. The lipovitellin isolated from the yolk granules is a carotenoid.lipoglycoprotein complex, containing 3.3% carbohydrate and 8.6% lipid. About half of the carbohydrate fraction is mannose and the rest consists of galactosamine, galactose, and glucosamine. The lipid fraction contained 67% phospholipid and 33% neutral lipid. Phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylserine are three major phospholipid components and their relative ratio changes by developmental stages. The neutral lipid fraction is composed of mainly triacylglycerol and cholesterol. Two polypeptide chains are identified as apoprotein components of the lipovitellin complex. Their molecular weights are estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis to be 190,000 and 68,000, respectively. The third polypeptide with Mr = 85,000 is a very minor component and exists in nonstoichiometric levels in the lipovitellin complex. On the basis of an apparent molecular weight of the lipovitellin complex determined by gel filtration chromatography, the dimeric lipovitellin form is suggested, each monomer of which contains one set of Mr = 190,000 and one set of Mr = 68,000 apoproteins. Each dimeric lipovitellin complex contains approximately 70 associated lipid molecules, of which about 4 are attributed to canthaxantin, and 100 bound carbohydrate molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1532511960,"A cyclic AMP-independent protein kinase has been isolated from human erythrocyte cytosol and purified about 28,000-fold. The enzyme uses ATP as the phosphoryl donor and exhibits a high activity towards casein and phosvitin. The kinase has a molecular weight of about 30,000 to 32,000 as estimated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation and Sephacryl S-200 gel filtration. Upon isoelectrofocusing, two kinase activities are resolved. The major component, which comprises about 85% of the activities, focuses at a pH of about 9.6 and the minor component at about 4.6. The relationship between these two kinase activities is not clear. NaF, ADP and, to a lesser extent, AMP, all inhibit the kinase activity. 2,3-Diphosphoglyceric acid, on the other hand, has no effect. The kinase also catalyzes the phosphorylation of a number of erythrocyte membrane proteins, including spectrin, band 3, and the sialoglycoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W1562287203,"Substitution of pp(CH2)pT for GTP in the polymerization of microtubular protein results in a marked enhancement of both the rate and the extent of microtubule nucleation. Comparison of the kinetics of microtubule polymerization and pp(CH2)pG hydrolysis reveals that massive microtubule nucleation occurs in the absence of pp(CH2)pG hydrolysis. The shortest microtubule nuclei formed in the presence of pp(CH2)pG are curled ribbons on three protofilaments 0.15 to 0.2 micrometer long. No specific effect of pp(CH2)pG on microtubule propagation is observed. Nucleotide chase experiments suggest that the rings of microtubular protein present at 4 degrees C are not incorporated directly into the microtubule. Microtubules polymerized by pp(CH2)pG do not show the treadmill of tubulin protomers characteristic of the microtubules polymerized by GTP. Nucleotide analysis of microtubules polymerized by pp(CH2)pG and GTP reveals that 95% of the exchangeable nucleotide contained in the microtubules is p(CH2)pG and GDP, respectively. pp(CH2)pG blocks the treadmill of tubulin protomers from microtubules assembled by GTP by suppressing depolymerization at the depolymerization end of the microtubule. On the other hand, GTP promotes the treadmill of tubulin from microtubules assembled by pp(CH2)pG by reactivating the depolymerization end of the microtubule."

https://openalex.org/W1533636181,"d-[3H]Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) bound to both dopamine- and serotonin (5HT)-sensitive sites in a particulate fraction derived from the central nervous system of the snail Helix pomatia. Conditions were found which enabled the two sites to be studied independently. [3H]LSD appeared to have a slightly higher affinity for dopamine-sensitive binding (Kd = 0.5 nM) than for 5HT-sensitive binding (Kd = 1.2 nM). A pharmacological analysis of the binding indicated that while dopamine- and 5HT-related agonists clearly discriminated between the two sites, putative antagonists showed little specificity for dopamine- or 5HT-sensitive binding. The pharmacology of 5HR-sensitive [3H]LSD binding was studied in relation to a 5HT-sensitive adenylate cyclase present in a particulate fraction derived from the same tissue. There was a very good correlation between the abilities of a range of agents to act as agonists or antagonists in the 5HT-sensitive adenylate cyclase assay and their abilities to displace 5HT-sensitive [3H]LSD binding (r = 0.94; p less than 0.001). In particular, d-LSD and a number of neurologic drugs were inhibitory in both assays in a stereoselective manner. These data suggest that in molluscan tissues, 5HT-sensitive [3H]LSD binding is related to the 5HT receptor which is coupled to adenylate cyclase."

In addition, an alternative method utilizing chromatography on quaternary aminoethyl (QAE)-Sephadex and Sephadex G-200 is also presented. Both procedures are capable of producing, from commerical material with a potency of approximately 2,500 IU/mg, a product in excess of 12,000 IU/mg. If care is taken in the selection of fractions from the hydroxylapatite chromatography, essentially purified material may be obtained in a single step. The best fraction from the QAE-Sephadex and G-200 chromatography procedure contains a minor impurity. Pregnant mare serum gonadotropin subunits were purified by a single chromatographic step from the foregoing preparations utilizing 6 M guanidine hydrochloride for dissociation, followed by chromatography on Sephadex G-75.

The pH dependence of the apparent second order rate constants indicates that the process occurs by reaction of catalase with un-ionized hydroperoxide molecules, The reaction of catalase with methyl hydroperoxide is pH-independent in the range pH 5.8 to 9.4, and lows as methyl hydroperoxide (pKa, 11.5) is deprotonated. Similarly, the reaction with peracetic acid is independent of pH from pH 5.8 to 6.5 and slows as peracetic acid (pKa 8.2) is deprotonated. The pH-independent rate constants for the formation of Compound I are 1.4 x 10(6), 2.7 x 10(4), and 3.8 x 10(4) M-1s-1 for methyl hydroperoxide, peracetic acid, and ethyl hydroperoxide, respectively, following a trend of decreasing rate as the size of the substrate increases.

The C gamma resonances of the 4 histidines are identified and assigned to specific residues. The effect of pH on the chemical shifts of these resonances yields information about the tautomeric state of the imidazole form of each histidine residue. Only His-119 exists predominantly or entirely in the common N epsilon 2-H (N tau-H) tautomeric state. His-12 and HIS-48 exist mainly or entirely in the N delta 1-H (N tau-H) tautomeric state. His-105 exhibits about 50 to 90% of the N delta 1-H tautomer. These results, when taken together with known crystallographic coordinates for ribonuclease A, strongly suggest that H delta 1 of His-105 is hydrogen bonded to the COOH-terminal carboxylate group, that H delta 1 of His-48 is hydrogen bonded to the carboxylate group of Asp-14 or (less likely) to the hydroxyl oxygen of Thr-17, and that H delta 1 of His-12 is probably hydrogen bonded to the hydroxyl oxygen of Thr-45."
https://openalex.org/W172004573,"Human serum albumin (HSA) is found to contain one primary binding site for medium chain fatty acids which is competitive with the binding of N-acetyl-L-tryptophan. The association constant is higher with nondefatted HSA than with HSA defatted by either heptane-acetic acid or charcoal extraction. Affinity labeling of HSA by N-bromoacetyl-n-decylamine (1:1 molar ratio) blocks the primary binding site of hexanoate and decanoate at an equivalency of the molar ratio of label incorporated. CNBr fragmentation reveals that the primary medium chain fatty acid binding site is positioned between Fragment C (residues 124 to 297) and A (residues 298 to 585). With nondefatted HSA, 60% of the label is associated with Fragment C and 35% with Fragment A, whereas upon defatting, this labeling pattern is reversed. The labeled residue in Fragment C is Lys 199, the same residue as acetylated by acetylsalicylate (Hawkins, D., Pinckard, R.N., Crawford, I.P., and Farr, R.S. (1969) J. Clin. Invest. 48, 536). Forty per cent of the label in Fragment A from nondefatted albumin is located in the A-Pro II subfragment (residues 447 to 548) and 60% in the A-Phe subfragment (residues 330 to 446). With defatted HSA, the A-Pro II subfragment contains 25% and the A-Phe subfragment contains 75% of the label. In all cases, labeling in the subfragments of Fragment A occurred at several different residues, indicating that this part of the binding site has considerable flexibility. The secondary binding sites for medium chain fatty acid are found to be the same general region as the primary binding site. N-Bromoacetyl-n-tetradecylamine (a long chain fatty acid-labeling agent) labeled only the A fragment of HSA."
https://openalex.org/W1555755177,"The present paper reports a spectroscopic and kinetic study of the reaction with oxygen and carbon monoxide of (a) the abnormal hemoglobin Zurich (beta 63, E7 His leads to Arg), (b) its isolated abnormal chains (beta ZH), and (c) a reconstituted hybrid containing cobalt instead of iron on the normal alpha chains (Co alpha)2-(Fe beta ZH)2. The abnormal beta ZH chains, isolated from hemoglobin Zurich (HbZH) tetramer, display very peculiar spectral properties in the Soret region which were determined, for the oxy and deoxy derivatives, by kinetic difference spectra. The spectral properties of abnormal chains are maintained in the native and reconstituted hybrid tetramer. The rate constants for CO and O2 binding to isolated beta ZH chains were compared with those of the normal alpha and beta chains, It is confirmed that the CO combination rate constant to beta ZH is much higher than that of normal chains, whereas that for O2 is similar for the normal and abnormal chains. The CO binding rate constant for Fe beta ZH chains in the hybrid tetramer is the same as in the native HbZH molecule, i.e. much higher than that of normal chain. The new data are fully consistent with the sequential mechanism for CO binding previously proposed by us; on the other hand, on the basis of the spectral and kinetic results, and contrary to what has been suggested by other authors, a sequential binding of the ligand is excluded in the case of O2."
https://openalex.org/W1608651978,"Human fibrinogen was treated with thrombin in the presence of fibrinoligase and calcium ion at pH 8.5, ionic strength 0.45, and the ensuring polymerization was interrupted at various time intervals (t) both before and after the clotting time (tc) by solubilization with a solution of sodium dodecyl sulfate and urea. Aliquots of the solubilized protein were subjected to gel electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels after disulfide reduction by dithiothreitol and on agarose gels without reduction. The degree of gamma-gamma ligation was determined from the former and the size distribution of ligated oligomers, for degree of polymerization x from 1 to 10, from the latter. The degree of gamma-gamma ligation was calculated independently from the size distribution with the assumption that every junction between two fibrin monomers remaining intact after solubilization is ligated, and this agreed well with the direct determination. The size distribution at t/tc = 1.3 to 1.6 differed somewhat from that calculated by the classical theory of linear polycondensation on the assumption that all reactive sites react with equal probability and rate. Analysis of the difference suggests that ligation of a fibrin digomer is not a random process; the probability of ligation of a given junction between two monomers increases with the oligomer length. The number-average degree of polymerization, xn, of ligated oligomers increases approximately linearly with time up to a value of 1.6."
https://openalex.org/W1483431931,"Addition of selenite to rabbit reticulocyte lysate produces a biphasic pattern of translational inhibition. Sucrose density gradient shows that the onset of translational inhibition is accompanied by decreased Met-tRNAf binding to 43 SN ribosomal subunits and loss of polysomes. Control rates of translation are restored by the addition of exogenous eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF-2). Selenite also directly inhibits Met-tRNAf binding activity of eIF-2. While selenite could react directly with unpaired cysteine residues of eIF-2 to inhibit protein synthesis initiation, a more complex mechanism than a direct inactivation of eIF-2 is suggested by the following observations: 1) translational inhibition produced by selenite is accompanied by an apparent increase in the phosphorylation state of eIF-2alpha; and 2) the extent of translational inhibiton is not proportional to steady-state level of phosphorylation. Rather, the time required for the onset of translational inhibition decreases as the level of eIF-2alpha phosphorylation is increased. This suggests a multistep sequence for eIF-2 inactivation, dependent upon an initial activation of eIF-2alpha kinase and followed by additional eIF-2 modification(s)."

https://openalex.org/W1540690626,"The requirements of lipophilic ions in the extraction of Ca/sup 2 +/ into an organic phase mediated by the delipidated calcium ionophore protein (calciphorin) have been investigated. It was found that the extraction of Ca/sup 2 +/ into an organic phase mediated by the delipidated calciphorin requires the presence of a lipophilic anion, picrate. Picrate also enhances the rate of calciphorin-mediated Ca/sup 2 +/ translocation through a bulk organic phase. The relative cation selectivity of calciphorin determined from the organic solvent extraction experiments is Zn/sup 2 +/ > Ca/sup 2 +/, Sr/sup 2 +/ > Mn/sup 2 +/. The delipidated calciphorin becomes more hydrophobic in the presence of Ca/sup 2 +/ and alkaline pH in the organic solvent extraction experiments. The pH profile of the mole ratio of Ca/sup 2 +/ to calciphorin exhibits a typical titration curve, showing a pK/sub a/ of 8.0 to 8.1. Ruthenium red and La/sup 3 +/ are shown to inhibit calciphorin-mediated Ca/sup 2 +/ extraction into the organic phase. The respiratory inhibitors, the mitochondrial ATPase inhibitor, and the uncoupling agent have no effect on the Ca/sup 2 +/ extraction. Phosphate does not stimulate calciphorin-mediated Ca/sup 2 +/ extraction. The Ca/sup 2 +/.calciphorin complex appearsmore » to have two positive charges. The delipidated calciphorin only has one class of Ca/sup 2 +/-binding sites as revealed from the flow dialysis studies. These Ca/sup 2 +/-binding sites have a dissociation constant of 5.2 ..mu..M and bound 1 mol of Ca/sup 2 +//mol of calciphorin. Evidence suggests that calciphorin may be a strong candidate for the Ca/sup 2 +/ carrier responsible for the influx mechanism in the mitochondrial Ca/sup 2 +/ transport system.« less"
https://openalex.org/W1566739174,"Seven urinary catabolites were identified after intravenous infusion of tritium-labeled prostaglandin F2 alpha in the adult rat. Most products were the result of oxidation at C-15, reduction of the delta 13,14 double bond, and double beta oxidation together with omega oxidation reactions yielding 14 and 16 carbon compounds. While the former sequence of reactions is also demonstrable in the neonate (2 weeks and older), the omega oxidation system develops around 28 to 32 days of age. Consequently, the urinary catabolic pattern resulting from infusion of tritiated prostaglandin F2, in the rat younger than 32 days is composed principally of one product identified as 15-keto-13,14-dihydrotetranor prostaglandin F2 alpha (VII). This product is one of the transient intermediates in the adult and is catabolized further by omega oxidation."

https://openalex.org/W1652521581,"DNA-cDNA titrations suggest that the Xenopus genome comprises two albumin genes, whereas there are 12 to 16 vitellogenin-like genes. Both sets of genes are in liver, those coding for albumin constitutively, but vitellogenin only when induced by estrogen in both male and female frogs. Mild micrococcal nuclease digestion of liver nuclei to separate expressed from unexpressed gene fractions (Tata, J. R., and Baker, B. S. (1978) J. Mol. Biol. 118, 249-272) revealed that the multiple vitellogenin genes are found in two chromosomal states, here termed as and nonexpressible. Both albumin genes were in the chromosomal state associated with expression, but of the 12 to 16 vitellogenin genes, only 4 to 6 are in the potentially expressible state. This distribution pattern is independent of sex and only slightly modified during induction or de-induction of vitellogenesis by estrogenic stimulation or withdrawal."
https://openalex.org/W1512905102,"A cytochemical method was used in order to visualize the existence of local concentrations of metabolites within an immobilized bienzyme system. Glucose oxidase (EC 1.1.3.4) and peroxidase (EC 1.11.1.7) were immobilized together into an artificial proteic membrane obtained by a previously described co-cross-linking process using a bifunctional agent, glutaraldehyde. The cytochemical reagent 3,3‘-diaminobenzidine was used as a hydrogen donor substrate and kinetic studies were performed with both free and immobilized forms of the enzymes; in the latter case, a new direct method was introduced which allowed kinetic studies on the visualization system itself. From experimental kinetic parameters, theoretical concentrations profiles were calculated by computer using numerical analysis methods. These results were discussed with special attention to the electron microscopic observations. Computer simulations were in good agreement with electron micrographs. No geometrical similarity was seen in our system between poly(3,3‘-diaminobenzidine) precipitate distribution and peroxidase molecule homogeneous location."

https://openalex.org/W1505491571,"The molecular weight of NaF-activated, Triton N-101-solubilized adenylate cyclase from bovine thyroid membranes has been measured by a combination of sucrose density centrifugation and gel exclusion chromatography. The physical parameters are: sedimentation coefficient, 6.6 S; Stokes radium 41 A; partial specific volume, 0.75 ml/g; molecular weight, 119,000. This is in contrast to the molecular weight (159,000) of the enzyme from the same source activated with guanosine 5'-(beta, gamma-imido)triphosphate. Both soluble adenylate cyclase enzymes are subject to cholera toxin-mediated ADP-ribosylation. This implies that the diminished molecular weight of the NaF-activated solubilized adenylate cyclase is a consequence of one of the following: loss of a GTP-binding protein and labeling of some other protein in the cyclase complex; loss of another protein not subject to cholera toxin labeling; or that two GTP-binding proteins normally reside within the catalytic complex and upon NaF activation one is lost."
