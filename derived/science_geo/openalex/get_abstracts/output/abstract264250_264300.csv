https://openalex.org/W2034648786,"Previous studies of anaerobic biocorrosion have suggested that microbial sulfur and phosphorus products as well as cathodic hydrogen consumption may accelerate anaerobic metal oxidation. Methanogenic bacteria, which normally use molecular hydrogen (H(2)) and carbon dioxide (CO(2)) to produce methane (CH(4)) and which are major inhabitants of most anaerobic ecosystems, use either pure elemental iron (Fe(0)) or iron in mild steel as a source of electrons in the reduction of CO(2) to CH(4). These bacteria use Fe(0) oxidation for energy generation and growth. The mechanism of Fe(0) oxidation is cathodic depolarization, in which electrons from Fe(0) and H(+) from water produce H(2), which is then released for use by the methanogens; thermodynamic calculations show that significant Fe(0) oxidation will not occur in the absence of H(2) consumption by the methanogens. The data suggest that methanogens can be significant contributors to the corrosion of iron-containing materials in anaerobic environments."
https://openalex.org/W2091049060,"Four isoheptanes in petroleum display a remarkable invariance in a ratio of sums of concentrations. The isoheptanes are not at thermodynamic equilibrium, nor are they fixed to some constant composition. The four isomers display coherent change in relative amounts but maintain invariance in the ratio of sums. Within sets of genetically related petroleum samples, invariance reaches levels that approach the limits of our analytical precision. The invariance is inconsistent with a chemical origin that involves the thermal fragmentation of natural products or their derivatives. It suggests a reaction process at steady state, in which relative rates of product formation are constant. A mechanism is proposed in which the four isoheptanes are formed pairwise and sequentially through two intermediates in a catalytic process that operates at steady state."

The sum of the radii of Pluto and Charon is 1786 +/- 19 kilometers, but the individual radii are somewhat more poorly determined; Pluto is 1145 +/- 46 kilometers in radius and Charon is 642 +/- 34 kilometers in radius. The mean density of the system is 1.84 +/- 0.19 grams per cubic centimeter, implying that more than half of the mass is due to rock. Charon appears to have hemispheres of two different colors, the Plutofacing side being neutral in color and the opposite hemisphere being a reddish color similar to Pluto."

https://openalex.org/W1970760948,"Estimates are given for ultimate limits on background in proposed direct-counting measurements of neutrino scattering from large silicon crystals. Methods of background reduction are discussed. In the best case, the limiting backgrounds due to activities from cosmic-ray spallation of silicon would be less than the expected true event rate for reactor neutrino measurements of coherent neutral-current scattering from silicon nuclei. Considerable reduction of the estimated high-energy backgrounds would be required for a good signal-to-noise ratio in solar neutrino detection."

https://openalex.org/W2049504919,"The regime of unmanaged floating exchange rates was implicitly judged a failure when, with the Plaza Agreement, attempts at cooperative exchange-rate management were reintroduced primarily because of concern at the size of misalignments. Any satisfactory successor regime will need to limit misalignments while retaining the genuine social benefits of exchange-rate flexibility. It is argued that a system of target zones for exchange rates, ideally embedded in a more comprehensive set of guidelines for international economic policy coordination, could best reconcile these needs."
