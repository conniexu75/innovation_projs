Our study challenges the existing model of HR-mediated DSB repair and reveals a surprising role for RNA-DNA hybrids in maintaining genomic stability. The integrity of the eukaryotic genome is continuously challenged by external factors, such as UV light, ionizing radiation, or DNA-damaging chemicals, but also by endogenous factors, including reactive oxygen species and replication- or transcription-related events. The DNA repair machinery identifies and repairs damaged DNA and ensures that the genetic information is maintained. Defects in DNA-damage signaling or repair can lead to cancer development and various developmental, immunological, and aging-related diseases (Vijg and Suh, 2013Vijg J. Suh Y. Genome instability and aging.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2013; 75: 645-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Among the different types of DNA damage, DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are the most deleterious, as they affect both strands of the DNA helix, and their inefficient or inaccurate repair can give rise to genome rearrangements, chromosomal translocations, and cell death. The basic mechanisms for the repair of DSBs have been extensively characterized over the past decades and have been found to be conserved from yeast to humans (Chapman et al., 2012Chapman J.R.

End-resection at DNA double-strand breaks in the three domains of life.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2013; 41: 314-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). DSBs can be repaired through two pathways: either the quick but error-prone non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway or the more accurate homologous-recombination (HR) pathway. HR-mediated DSB repair requires the presence of sister chromatids, which restricts this pathway to cells in G2 or S phase. In this pathway, DSBs are detected by the highly conserved Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1/Xrs2 (MRN/MRX) complex, which activates the checkpoint kinase ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated). ATM rapidly phosphorylates various DNA repair factors and initiates a global DNA damage response (DDR) in the cell. The MRN/MRX complex, together with Sae2, is also responsible for the initial resection of the DSB ends, generating short, single-stranded 3′ overhangs (Mimitou and Symington, 2009Mimitou E.P.

Subsequent long-range resection of the 5′ strand is performed by the 5′-3′ exonuclease Exo1 or the Dna2-Sgs1/BLM complex (Mimitou and Symington, 2008Mimitou E.P. Symington L.S.

Trans. 2013; 41: 314-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The long, single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) overhangs that are generated are bound and protected by the trimeric replication protein A (RPA) complex. Subsequently, with the help of Rad52/BRCA2, the RPA complex is replaced by the Rad51 recombinase, forming long nucleoprotein filaments. These Rad51 filaments are essential for the homology search and strand invasion into the undamaged sister chromatid and for the completion of the DNA repair process. Recent data suggest that non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) also play a role in the DNA repair process (Chowdhury et al., 2013Chowdhury D. Choi Y.E. Brault M.E.

Small ncRNAs were detected in the vicinity of DSBs in various organisms (Lee et al., 2009Lee H.C. Chang S.S. Choudhary S. Aalto A.P. Maiti M. Bamford D.H.

Site-specific DICER and DROSHA RNA products control the DNA-damage response.Nature. 2012; 488: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), and it was proposed that they function in the DDR by directing chromatin modifications and other protein complexes to the DSB sites. The production and function of these 20- to 21-nt short ncRNAs are mediated by key RNAi factors, such as the Dicer, Drosha, and Argonaute proteins (Chowdhury et al., 2013Chowdhury D. Choi Y.E. Brault M.E. Charity begins at home: non-coding RNA functions in DNA repair.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2013; 14: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In addition to the recruitment of various factors, RNA can also serve as a template for DSB repair, as was recently reported in S. cerevisiae (Keskin et al., 2014Keskin H. Shen Y. Huang F. Patel M. Yang T. Ashley K. Mazin A.V. Storici F. Transcript-RNA-templated DNA recombination and repair.Nature. 2014; 515: 436-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). RNA transcripts can also negatively affect genomic stability by re-annealing to their template DNA strand. The resulting RNA-DNA hybrid and the displaced ssDNA segment is called the R-loop structure. R-loops are highly deleterious for genome integrity, as they can block transcription and DNA replication, resulting in replicative stress and the formation of DSBs (Aguilera and García-Muse, 2012Aguilera A. García-Muse T. R loops: from transcription byproducts to threats to genome stability.Mol. Cell. 2012; 46: 115-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar, Helmrich et al., 2013Helmrich A. Ballarino M. Nudler E. Tora L. Transcription-replication encounters, consequences and genomic instability.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2013; 20: 412-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). To avoid the formation of R-loops, eukaryotic cells co-transcriptionally package the nascent RNA transcripts into ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs) and quickly export them to the cytoplasm. Impaired packaging or nucleo-cytoplasmic export leaves unprotected RNA transcripts in the nucleus and leads to increased levels of R-loop formation and genomic instability. The RNase H family of enzymes can degrade R-loops by cleaving the RNA moiety of the RNA-DNA hybrid in a sequence-independent manner. Eukaryotic cells possess two types of RNase H enzymes; RNase H1 is monomeric, while RNase H2 is a heterotrimeric complex consisting of the catalytic subunit Rnh201 and two auxiliary subunits, Rnh202 and Rnh203. While RNase H2 enzymes can cleave a single ribonucleotide embedded in a DNA duplex, RNase H1 requires a minimum of four consecutive ribonucleotides. However, both types of RNase H enzymes can degrade extended RNA-DNA hybrid structures, typically found in R-loops (Cerritelli and Crouch, 2009Cerritelli S.M. Crouch R.J. Ribonuclease H: the enzymes in eukaryotes.FEBS J. 2009; 276: 1494-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). In addition to degrading R-loops, RNase H activity is also involved in eliminating RNA primers and mis-incorporated ribonucleotides during the DNA replication process. In mammals, RNase H1 is indispensable for embryonic development and mtDNA replication (Cerritelli et al., 2003Cerritelli S.M. Frolova E.G. Feng C. Grinberg A. Love P.E. Crouch R.J. Failure to produce mitochondrial DNA results in embryonic lethality in Rnaseh1 null mice.Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 807-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), and mutations in any of the RNase H2 subunits have been associated with the neuroinflammatory disease Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS) (Crow et al., 2006Crow Y.J. Leitch A. Hayward B.E. Garner A. Parmar R. Griffith E. Ali M. Semple C. Aicardi J. Babul-Hirji R. et al.Mutations in genes encoding ribonuclease H2 subunits cause Aicardi-Goutières syndrome and mimic congenital viral brain infection.Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 910-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Interestingly, RNase H activity is not required for cell survival in bacteria and in simple eukaryotic organisms, and our understanding of the in vivo functions of these evolutionarily highly conserved enzymes is still preliminary. Here, we show that RNase H activity is essential for the efficient repair of DSBs in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe (S. pombe). Deletion of RNase H1 and RNase H2, or overexpression of RNase H1, resulted in the inhibition of HR-mediated DSB repair. Using a site-specific DSB system, we showed the recruitment of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and the formation of RNA-DNA hybrids around the DSB site. These hybrids were stabilized in cells lacking RNase H activity, leading to strongly impaired recruitment of the ssDNA-binding RPA complex around the DSB site. Overexpression of RNase H1 had the opposite effect, eliminating RNA-DNA hybrids around the DSB and inducing excessive strand resection and RPA recruitment over a longer distance from the DSB site. As a consequence, under conditions of RNase H1 overexpression, repetitive DNA regions around DSBs became destabilized, which particularly affects the highly repetitive rDNA locus. Our results suggest that the appearance of short ssDNA segments around DSB sites induce Pol II transcription and RNA-DNA hybrid formation, and these hybrids are involved in regulating the strand resection process and the recruitment of RPA complex around DSB sites. RNase H activity is subsequently required to degrade these RNA-DNA intermediates and allow the completion of the DSB repair process. To further understand the in vivo functions of RNase H enzymes, we analyzed the growth behavior and DNA-damage sensitivity of S. pombe strains lacking RNase H1 and/or RNase H2. Neither the single-deletion strains (rnh1Δ and rnh201Δ) nor the double-deletion strain (rnh1Δrnh201Δ) showed a significant growth defect, indicating that, under normal growth conditions, RNase H activity is not critical for cell survival in S. pombe. However, RNase H activity becomes essential if the cells are exposed to genotoxic drugs that cause DSBs, such as camptothecin (CPT), hydroxyurea (HU), or methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) (Figure 1A). The strong DSB sensitivity observed for the rnh1Δrnh201Δ strain was not detected in the rnh1Δ or the rnh201Δ single-deletion strains, suggesting that the two types of RNase H enzymes work redundantly in this process. Since the structural similarity between Rnh1 and the trimeric Rnh201-202-203 complex is limited to the catalytic (RNase H) domain, the strong DNA-damage sensitivity observed in the double-deletion strain can be attributed to the lack of RNase H activity in the cell. Interestingly, while the lack of topoisomerase 1 enzyme (Top1) is known to cause strong genomic instability, the top1Δ strain shows only mild sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents. The strong DSB sensitivity observed for the rnh1Δrnh201Δ strain is more comparable to the phenotype of a mutant with impaired DSB repair, such as the rad52Δ strain (Figure 1A). Cells lacking RNase H activity accumulate RNA-DNA hybrids and R-loop structures genome-wide, which might influence the chromatin structure and/or the accessibility of the DNA to genotoxic chemicals. We wondered whether the strong DNA-damage sensitivity of the rnh1Δrnh201Δ mutant was due to either the increased level of DNA damage in response to DSB-inducing chemicals or the impairment of DNA repair in this mutant. In order to distinguish between these possibilities, we generated a tetracycline-inducible site-specific DSB system using the homing endonuclease I-PpoI (Figure S1A). S. pombe has one I-PpoI cleavage site within the rDNA, but since the rDNA is repeated ∼150 times (separated in two clusters at both ends of chr III), I-PpoI has about 150 endogenous cleavage sites in the fission yeast genome. In addition to the natural cleavage sites, we integrated a single artificial cleavage site at chr II (Figure 1B). We induced I-PpoI expression for 2 hr in wild-type (WT), rad52Δ, rad51Δ, pku80Δ, rnh1Δ, rnh201Δ, and rnh1Δrnh201Δ strains before plating the cells on media in which I-PpoI expression was repressed. The expression level and cleavage efficiency of I-PpoI, and the turnover dynamics of the protein following repression of I-PpoI transcription, were identical in all strains (Figures 1C, S1B, and S1D). Following I-PpoI-induced DSBs, ∼73% of the WT cells were able to recover, while an identical strain lacking the I-PpoI open reading frame (ORF) (no I-PpoI strain) showed full (∼100%) recovery. Deletion of Pku80 (S. pombe KU80 homolog), an essential component of the NHEJ repair pathway, did not influence the survival rate after chemical- (Figure 1A) or endonuclease-induced DSBs (76%, Figures 1D and S2A), indicating that the NHEJ pathway is dispensable for the DSB repair process in S. pombe. However, deletion of Rad52 or Rad51, two essential factors in the HR-mediated repair pathway, drastically reduced the recovery rate after I-PpoI-induced DSBs to ∼2% and ∼14%, respectively. Interestingly, while rnh1Δ or rnh201Δ single deletions were indistinguishable from the WT, the rnh1Δrnh201Δ double-deletion strain could not recover after I-PpoI-induced DSBs (∼10% recovery rate). Since the cleavage efficiency of I-PpoI was equivalent in all strains, this result suggests that RNase H activity is required for efficient HR-mediated DSB repair in S. pombe.Figure S2Deletion or Over-Expression of RNase H Impairs DSB Repair in the Presence or Absence of Damage at the rDNA Repeats, Related to Figures 1D and 1EShow full caption(A) Cleavage and recovery of the I-PpoI cleavage site at chr II in the pku80Δ mutant.

Data are represented as mean + SEM of at least 3 biological replicates. p values were obtained using the two-tailed unpaired Student’s t test (∗∗p ≤ 0.01; ∗∗∗∗p ≤ 0.0001). To monitor the DNA repair efficiency at the cleavage sites, we isolated the genomic DNA from the WT and mutant strains and quantified the repaired DNA strands by qPCR using primers spanning the cleavage sites (Figures 1E and S2A). We observed ∼75% cleavage efficiency at the artificial cleavage site at chr II in all strains after 2-hr induction of the I-PpoI system. While WT and pku80Δ mutant cells showed swift DSB repair, the DNA repair mutant rad52Δ and the rnh1Δrnh201Δ mutants were unable to repair the I-PpoI-induced DSB. Similar results were observed at the cleavage sites at the repetitive rDNA loci (Figure 1F). Overall, using the site-specific I-PpoI system, we demonstrated that the strong DSB sensitivity of the rnh1Δrnh201Δ mutant was caused by a severely impaired DNA repair process and was not the result of increased DNA damage. Taken together, these results demonstrate that RNase H activity is necessary for efficient HR-mediated DSB repair in S. pombe. The strong requirement for RNase H activity in the HR-mediated repair pathway suggests the presence of RNA-DNA hybrids during the course of DNA repair and indicates that these hybrids inhibit the completion of the repair process. We wondered whether these RNA-DNA hybrids are a by-product of the DNA repair process and act only as inhibitory structures or whether they are intermediate structures with an unknown function in the HR-mediated DNA repair. In order to answer this question, we studied the effect of Rnh1 overexpression in the DSB repair process. We used the strong, inducible Nmt1 promoter to overexpress the Rnh1 ORF in our I-PpoI DSB system (Pnmt1-Rnh1) and monitored the DSB repair efficiency under Nmt1-inducing and non-inducing conditions. While Rnh1 overexpression did not affect the growth of S. pombe under normal growth conditions, it reduced the recovery rate after I-PpoI-induced DSBs to about ∼3%. As per our standard recovery assay, we incubated the plates for 2 days at 30°C and counted the colonies to determine the recovery rate. Interestingly, we noticed that, if we kept these plates at 30°C for a longer period of time, additional small colonies appeared, and after 4 days of incubation, the recovery rate increased to ∼17% in the Pnmt1-Rnh1 strain (Figure 1D). This was only observed when both Rnh1 overexpression and I-PpoI cleavage were induced. The colony numbers and the corresponding recovery rates were unchanged in all other strains after an extended incubation time. We also monitored the amount of repaired DNA strands directly at the I-PpoI cleavage sites. At chr II, we observed a strong delay in the repair process under conditions of Rnh1 overexpression, while at the ribosomal repeats, we could not detect any progression of the repair process during the 12-hr recovery period (Figures 1E and 1F). Overall, these results show that Rnh1 overexpression negatively influences DSB repair efficiency and suggest that RNA-DNA hybrids might represent a functional intermediate in the course of the HR-mediated repair process. To exclude the possibility that deletion or overexpression of RNase H could indirectly affect DNA repair by influencing the RNA levels of key DNA repair genes, we carried out genome-wide expression profiling in the rnh1Δrnh210Δ and Pnmt1-Rnh1 strains. The results show that only a small number of genes are affected by deletion or overexpression of RNase H (Table S3), and none of these have any known function in the DNA repair process. In order to demonstrate direct evidence for the presence of RNA-DNA hybrids around the I-PpoI cleavage site, we carried out chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments using the S9.6 monoclonal antibody that specifically recognizes RNA-DNA hybrids of different lengths. We tested the presence of RNA-DNA hybrids 700 bp upstream of the I-PpoI cleavage site at chr II, either before or after 2-hr I-PpoI endonuclease induction (Figure 2A). We could not detect RNA-DNA hybrids at levels above background (no antibody control) in the absence of I-PpoI expression in the tested strains. However, after I-PpoI-induced DSBs, RNA-DNA hybrids were strongly enriched around the cleavage site in all tested strains. The amount of RNA-DNA hybrids was approximately the same in the WT, rnh1Δ, or rnh201Δ strains, while the rnh1Δrnh201Δ strain showed significantly increased enrichment of the hybrids upon I-PpoI expression. In contrast, overexpression of Rnh1 (Pnmt1-Rnh1 strain) led to the reverse effect and completely diminished the enrichment of the I-PpoI-induced RNA-DNA hybrids. Treatment of the cell extracts with recombinant bacterial RNase H during the ChIP protocol also decreased the signal to the background level, further validating the specificity of the ChIP signal. Overall, these experiments demonstrate that RNA-DNA hybrids form around DSBs and that extending or reducing the lifetime of these RNA-DNA hybrid structures (by depleting or overexpressing RNase H activity in the cells) can adversely affect the efficient completion of the repair process. To more precisely determine the extent and directionality of the RNA-DNA hybrids around the DSB site, we used a modified ChIP-exo method to map RNA-DNA hybrids in the rnh1Δrnh210Δ strain (Figure 2B). This technique allows the strand-specific detection of RNA-DNA hybrids genome-wide, although with decreased sensitivity (the presence of RNA-DNA hybrids impairs the ligation efficiency during the library preparation). Overall, our data showed a similar genome-wide enrichment profile for RNA-DNA hybrids, as previously reported (Chan et al., 2014Chan Y.A. Aristizabal M.J. Lu P.Y. Luo Z. Hamza A. Kobor M.S.

Genome-wide distribution of RNA-DNA hybrids identifies RNase H targets in tRNA genes, retrotransposons and mitochondria.PLoS Genet. 2014; 10: e1004716Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar); however, these hybrids were not affected by the induction or repression of I-PpoI expression. Examination of the region around the I-PpoI cleavage site at chr II upon I-PpoI induction revealed a strong increase in the amount of RNA-DNA hybrid structures up to 2 kb upstream and downstream of the cleavage site. With the exception of this region, the signal was highly similar between induced and non-induced samples. We could not reliably map the I-PpoI-induced RNA-DNA hybrids at the rDNA repeats due to the high background signal and/or the high basal level of RNA-DNA hybrids at this region. The distribution of the hybrids was strand specific, detected mainly on the forward DNA strand upstream of the cleavage site and on the reverse DNA strand downstream of the cleavage site. This distribution corresponds to RNA strands pointing away from the DSB site with their 3′ ends, indicating RNA polymerase activity that transcribes away from the DSB in both directions. This topology is consistent with the possibility that the known HR-mediated repair intermediate structure, comprising 3′ ssDNA tails around the DSB, is used as the template strand for Pol II transcription. The formation of RNA-DNA hybrids around the DSB site suggests active transcription in this region, either before or after the DNA damage. One possibility is that transcripts that existed before the DSBs can hybridize with the ssDNA intermediates of the HR-mediated repair and form stable RNA-DNA hybrids around the cleavage site. Alternatively, transcription around the DSB might be induced by the DSB itself, and the resulting nascent transcripts could form hybrids with their template strand. We carried out Pol II ChIP experiments using a non-phospho-specific antibody (8WG16) and monitored Pol II enrichment at three different locations in the vicinity of the I-PpoI cleavage site and at three locations further from the cleavage site (2 kb, 10 kb, and 370 Mb from the cleavage site; Figure 3A). Induction of I-PpoI led to a surge in the Pol II levels at all investigated locations around the"

However, a comprehensive understanding of sirtuin targets, regulation of sirtuin activity, and the relationships between sirtuins remains a key challenge in mitochondrial physiology. Here, we employ systematic interaction proteomics to elucidate the mitochondrial sirtuin protein interaction landscape. This work reveals sirtuin interactions with numerous functional modules within mitochondria, identifies candidate sirtuin substrates, and uncovers a fundamental role for sequestration of SIRT3 by ATP synthase in mitochondrial homeostasis. In healthy mitochondria, a pool of SIRT3 binds ATP synthase, but upon matrix pH reduction with concomitant loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, SIRT3 dissociates. This release correlates with rapid deacetylation of matrix proteins, and SIRT3 is required for recovery of membrane potential. In vitro reconstitution experiments, as well as analysis of CRISPR/Cas9-engineered cells, indicate that pH-dependent SIRT3 release requires H135 in the ATP5O subunit of ATP synthase. Our SIRT3–5 interaction network provides a framework for discovering novel biological functions regulated by mitochondrial sirtuins. Mitochondrial sirtuins, SIRT3–5, are NAD+-dependent deacylases and ADP-ribosyltransferases that are critical for stress responses. However, a comprehensive understanding of sirtuin targets, regulation of sirtuin activity, and the relationships between sirtuins remains a key challenge in mitochondrial physiology. Here, we employ systematic interaction proteomics to elucidate the mitochondrial sirtuin protein interaction landscape.

Our SIRT3–5 interaction network provides a framework for discovering novel biological functions regulated by mitochondrial sirtuins. The conserved sirtuin superfamily of NAD+-dependent protein deacetylases, deacylases, and ADP-ribosyltransferases regulates a range of cellular functions through post-translational modification of protein substrates. Three sirtuins, SIRT3, SIRT4, and SIRT5, reside within the mitochondrion, an organelle that specializes in energy production, fuel partitioning, stress responses, and signaling (Verdin et al., 2010Verdin E. Hirschey M.D. Finley L.W. Haigis M.C. Sirtuin regulation of mitochondria: energy production, apoptosis, and signaling.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2010; 35: 669-675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). SIRT3 is the most thoroughly studied mitochondrial sirtuin. It possesses robust deacetylase activity toward a cadre of metabolic targets, including subunits of the electron transport chain (ETC), as well as enzymes involved in fatty acid oxidation, amino acid metabolism, redox balance, and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (Kumar and Lombard, 2015Kumar S. Lombard D.B. Mitochondrial sirtuins and their relationships with metabolic disease and cancer.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2015; 22: 1060-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Indeed, previous studies have shown that enzymes central to mitochondrial oxidative metabolism are modified by lysine acetylation, and many of these proteins are hyperacetylated when SIRT3 is absent (Hebert et al., 2013Hebert A.S. Dittenhafer-Reed K.E. Yu W. Bailey D.J. Selen E.S. Boersma M.D. Carson J.J. Tonelli M. Balloon A.J.

Cell. 2013; 49: 186-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). By contrast, much less is understood about the functions of SIRT4 and SIRT5. SIRT4 acts upon glutamate dehydrogenase and malonyl-CoA decarboxylase to regulate amino acid and fatty acid utilization, respectively (Csibi et al., 2013Csibi A. Fendt S.M. Li C. Poulogiannis G.

SIRT5 possesses deacylase activity and has been implicated in pyruvate metabolism via control of oxidative phosphorylation (Park et al., 2013Park J. Chen Y. Tishkoff D.X. Peng C. Tan M. Dai L. Xie Z.

Cell. 2013; 50: 919-930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). Surveys of the mitochondrial proteome revealed that a surprisingly large number of mitochondrial proteins are acetylated or succinylated (Kim et al., 2006Kim S.C. Sprung R. Chen Y. Xu Y. Ball H. Pei J. Cheng T. Kho Y. Xiao H. Xiao L. et al.Substrate and functional diversity of lysine acetylation revealed by a proteomics survey.Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 607-618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar). However, our global understanding of sirtuin-substrate relationships is limited, and only a fraction of mitochondrial deacetylation is thought to be mediated by SIRT3 (Hebert et al., 2013Hebert A.S. Dittenhafer-Reed K.E. Yu W. Bailey D.J. Selen E.S. Boersma M.D. Carson J.J. Tonelli M. Balloon A.J.

A comprehensive analysis of the sirtuin protein interaction network may aid in the elucidation of mechanisms controlling sirtuin activity and facilitate the identification of candidate targets not previously associated with sirtuins. In this study, we utilized a proteomic approach to systematically define the mitochondrial sirtuin-interacting proteins and their subnetwork topology. Sirtuins associated with numerous functional modules critical for mitochondrial homeostasis and also protein assemblies not previously linked to sirtuins, including protein synthesis and transcription modules. Moreover, analysis of the network uncovered a dynamic redistribution of SIRT3 via binding with ATP5O upon membrane potential stress, providing a fundamental mechanism by which the cell is able to acutely toggle mitochondrial acetylation and fuel utilization in response to cellular stress. To generate the mitochondrial sirtuin network, we employed a two-tiered proteomic approach (Figure 1A) in order to (1) identify specific SIRT3–5-interacting proteins (SIPs) and (2) define mitochondrial subnetworks associated with sirtuins by mapping the architecture of the SIPs using reciprocal interaction proteomics (Figure 1A). This strategy allowed us to generate a comprehensive, high-confidence map of SIRT3–5-binding partners and to place these partners within an architectural framework linked with mitochondrial biology. We utilized HEK293T cells stably expressing SIRT3, SIRT4, or SIRT5 with a C-terminal HA epitope tag (Figure 1B), validated their localization to mitochondria, and performed immunoprecipitation, followed by LC-MS/MS (IP-MS), in a total of 6–9 biological replicates. One challenge of defining the SIRT3–5 interactomes is that these sirtuin-substrate interactions may be weaker than more stable protein complexes. Our solution for deconvoluting the sirtuin network involved identifying mitochondrial proteins that physically associated with each sirtuin with a frequency that was higher than their interaction with a non-sirtuin related protein using a database of 171 immunoprecipitations of unrelated baits using the same conditions (Sowa et al., 2009Sowa M.E. Bennett E.J. Gygi S.P. Harper J.W. Defining the human deubiquitinating enzyme interaction landscape.Cell. 2009; 138: 389-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar). To identify specific interacting proteins, we compared proteins identified in sirtuin IPs to analogous datasets for non-sirtuin bait proteins (n = 171 IPs) using binomial distribution and a 95% confidence interval (C.I.) cut-off (Figures 1C, 1D, and S1 and Table S1). This approach allowed us to identify interacting proteins of low abundance but high specificity for sirtuins, which may be of particular relevance for transient enzyme-substrate interactions. We analyzed mitochondria-targeted DSRED-interacting proteins as a negative control and identified only HSPE1, indicating that this method removed hundreds of non-specific, spurious binding proteins. We utilized DLAT as a positive control and identified known DLAT binding partners (PDHA, PDHB, and PDHX) (Figure S2A and Table S1). To define the mitochondrial connectivity, we generated a final list, including only proteins previously established to reside in mitochondria (Pagliarini et al., 2008Pagliarini D.J. Calvo S.E. Chang B. Sheth S.A. Vafai S.B. Ong S.E. Walford G.A. Sugiana C. Boneh A. Chen W.K. et al.A mitochondrial protein compendium elucidates complex I disease biology.Cell. 2008; 134: 112-123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1491) Google Scholar). In total, we identified 84 SIRT3, 29 SIRT4, and 6 SIRT5 high-confidence candidate binding partners (Figure 1E and Table S1).Figure S2Validation and Analysis of Mitochondrial Sirtuin Interactome, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Heatmap of representative mitochondrial sirtuin interacting proteins (SIPs).

(F) Analysis of protein domain enriched in SIRT3 interactomes compared to the entire mitochondrial proteome as a background dataset. The fidelity and reproducibility of SIPs were validated by performing IP-MS under different experimental conditions, including from chemically crosslinked 293T lysates, from mitochondria isolated from 293T cells, and from HCT116 cell lysates (Figures 1E and 1F and Tables S2, S3, and S4). Proteins only identified in 293T cells were moved from the list of SIPs. Of note, 29 SIRT3-, 15 SIRT4-, and 1 SIRT5-interacting proteins were identified across all four experimental conditions (Figure 1F and Table S5). High-confidence SIRT3–5-binding proteins linked several areas of mitochondrial biology (Figure 2A). SIRT3-interacting proteins were enriched in biological processes involving translation and energy metabolism (Figures 2A and 2B). SIRT4-interacting proteins demonstrated a similar enrichment as SIRT3, with an additional enrichment in anion transporters (Figures 2A, 2B, and S2C–E). SIRT5 associated with the fewest proteins and was primarily involved in metabolism and translation (Figures 2A and 2B). Compared to SIRT3 and SIRT4, there were more SIRT5-interacting proteins localized outside of the mitochondria, consistent with SIRT5 being present in other compartments (Table S1). Across all conditions, we identified several previously reported SIRT3 substrates, such as GLUD1, NDUFA9, and PDHB (Figure S2A) (German and Haigis, 2015German N.J. Haigis M.C. Sirtuins and the Metabolic Hurdles in Cancer.Curr. Biol. 2015; 25: R569-R583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Importantly, as 87% of the candidate interactions across SIRT3–5 have not previously been linked with sirtuins, this sirtuin interactome serves as a hypothesis-generating resource for exploring new areas of sirtuin biology and for understanding the molecular points of convergence of sirtuin activity. One purpose of this study was to identify specificity and overlap in proteins associated with sirtuins. SIRT3 and SIRT4 displayed the most extensive overlap, with 19 common binding partners (Figures 2C and 2D). Importantly, we also identified interacting proteins that were unique to each mitochondrial sirtuin (Figures 2A and 2C–E). For example, LARS2 was specific for binding to SIRT3, while NDUFV3 was specific for binding to SIRT5 (Figure 2E). A major goal of this proteomic approach was to identify candidate sirtuin substrates. Indeed, five proteins in the high-confidence network have previously been characterized as SIRT3–5 substrates/interacting proteins, including PDHB, ATP5O, and ATP5B for SIRT3, GLUD1 for SIRT3 and SIRT4, and IDE for SIRT4 (German and Haigis, 2015German N.J. Haigis M.C. Sirtuins and the Metabolic Hurdles in Cancer.Curr. Biol. 2015; 25: R569-R583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Thus, we systematically examined the interactome for reported acetylation (http://www.phosphosite.org/), finding that 90% of high-confidence SIPs are acetylated (Figure 2D) (Hornbeck et al., 2015Hornbeck P.V. Zhang B. Murray B. Kornhauser J.M. Latham V. Skrzypek E. PhosphoSitePlus, 2014: mutations, PTMs and recalibrations.Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43: D512-D520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1664) Google Scholar). Moreover, 30% of SIRT3-interacting proteins were reported to be hyperacetylated in SIRT3 knockout (KO) mouse tissues (Figure S2C) (Hebert et al., 2013Hebert A.S. Dittenhafer-Reed K.E. Yu W. Bailey D.J. Selen E.S. Boersma M.D. Carson J.J. Tonelli M. Balloon A.J. Higbee A.J. et al.Calorie restriction and SIRT3 trigger global reprogramming of the mitochondrial protein acetylome.Mol. Cell. 2013; 49: 186-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). We also identified two protein domains enriched in the SIRT3 interactome using the InterPro database: ATPase AAA+ type and mitochondrial substrate carrier (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/) (Figure S2F), which may be linked to acetylation. Among new proteins associating with SIRT3 and SIRT4 was 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (OGDH) (Figures 2A and 2D), a TCA enzyme that converts 2-oxoglutarate to succinyl-CoA. We observed binding between SIRT3 and OGDH at endogenous levels (Figure 2F). Consistent with a role for SIRT3 in deacetylating OGDH, acetylation levels of OGDH were elevated in SIRT3 KO in brain lysates, while OGDH protein levels were unchanged (Figure 2G). Finally, OGDH enzymatic activity was reduced in lysates from SIRT3 KO mouse brain (Figure 2H). Taken together, these data are consistent with the hypothesis that OGDH acetylation and activity are regulated by SIRT3 and suggests that some acetylated proteins found in association with SIRT3 may be substrates of this enzyme. A critical step in evaluating the sirtuin network is the validation of candidate SIPs, coupled with a detailed understanding of the individual networks of candidate SIPs. We selected 59 SIPs distributed across all major biological categories identified in the initial sirtuin network (Figure 2A and Tables S1, S2, S3, and S4) and stably expressed these genes via lentiviral transduction with a C-terminal HA-FLAG tag. We tested 42 SIPs and observed co-localization with Mitotracker Green in the mitochondria (Figures 3A, 3B, and S3D). To validate interactions with SIRT3, 40 individual SIPs were immunoprecipitated with α-HA antibodies and examined for association with endogenous SIRT3 using immunoblotting. Except for KARS, all proteins passed this criteria for validated SIRT3 binding (Figures 3A, 3C, and Figure S3A and Table S6). All 8 SIRT4 and 4 SIRT5 SIPs tested were found to associate in this assay (Figures 3C, S3B, and S3C and Table S6). Thus, the sirtuin network appears to be robust.Figure S3Validation of Mitochondrial Sirtuin Interactome, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) IP-Western blotting validation of SIRT3 interacting partners.

DAPI staining indicates nuclei. To assemble SIPs into defined mitochondrial subnetworks, we performed immunoprecipitation and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for candidate SIPs, followed by Comparative Proteomic Analysis Software Suite (CompPASS) analysis. CompPASS uses a metric (normalized weighted D-score, NWD) involving protein frequency, reproducibility, and abundance across a large set of parallel immunoprecipitation/LC-MS/MS experiments (in this case, >200 immunoprecipitations; Table S7) to identify high-confidence interacting proteins (HCIPs) present in stable complexes (Sowa et al., 2009Sowa M.E. Bennett E.J. Gygi S.P. Harper J.W. Defining the human deubiquitinating enzyme interaction landscape.Cell. 2009; 138: 389-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar). From 58 SIP baits, we identified 136 mitochondrial HCIPs with an NWD score higher than 0.8 and Z score higher than 9 with a FDR of < 2% on both peptide and protein level (Figures 3D and S5A) (https://haigis.hms.harvard.edu/mitochondrial-sirtuin-network). These mitochondrial HCIPs were incorporated into network maps together with the direct sirtuin network (Figure 2D) to create an integrated network model (Figure 3D). The topology of the network was defined for 41, 13, and 4 SIPs for SIRT3, SIRT4, and SIRT5, respectively (Figure 4). The resulting mitochondrial sirtuin network defines a comprehensive interactome for mitochondrial sirtuins and reveals insight into the complex subnetworks associated with sirtuin-protein interactions. The mitochondrial sirtuin network identified here consisted of 197 proteins and 341 interactions (Figures 3D and 4), yielding insight into the architecture of mitochondrial protein complexes within the sirtuin network. To probe this network, two subnetworks were generated from our dataset containing SIPs from the mitochondrial ribosome (MR) (5 SIPs) or ATP synthase (5 SIPs) (Figure 3E). We identified 48 proteins in the MR subnetwork, of which 40 (83% of the subnetwork) were previously identified as bona fide subunits of MR. In the ATP synthase subnetwork, we identified 13 proteins, of which 10 (77% of the subnetwork) are known subunits, as well as SIRT3, consistent with experiments described above (Figure 3A). Furthermore, the MR and ATP synthase subnetworks displayed a 41% and 32% overlap, respectively, with reported interactomes from BioGRID (Stark et al., 2006Stark C. Breitkreutz B.J. Reguly T. Boucher L. Breitkreutz A. Tyers M. BioGRID: a general repository for interaction datasets.Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: D535-D539Crossref PubMed Scopus (2742) Google Scholar). We next performed an unbiased identification of protein subnetworks within the mitochondrial sirtuin interactome using two independent analyses of clustering (ClusterOne and Hierarchical clustering) (Figures 3F, S4, and S5). Based on ClusterOne analysis, we identified six protein complexes within the mitochondria (Nepusz et al., 2012Nepusz T. Yu H. Paccanaro A. Detecting overlapping protein complexes in protein-protein interaction networks.Nat. Methods. 2012; 9: 471-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). The top-ranked complex (p < 0.000006) was for the MR large subunit, followed by ATP synthase, complex I, mitochondrial inner membrane organizing system (MINOS), OGDHC, and PDH (Figures 3F and S4). Five of these protein complexes were also identified by NWD score-based hierarchical clustering analysis (Figures S5B–S5E).Figure S5Hierarchical Clustering Analysis of Mitochondrial Sirtuin Network, Related to Figure 5Show full caption(A) Hierarchical clustering analysis based on NWD scores identified mitochondrial protein clusters within the mitochondrial sirtuin network, represented as a heatmap.

https://openalex.org/W2543384879,"Tetraspanins comprise a diverse family of four-pass transmembrane proteins that play critical roles in the immune, reproductive, genitourinary, and auditory systems. Despite their pervasive roles in human physiology, little is known about the structure of tetraspanins or the molecular mechanisms underlying their various functions. Here, we report the crystal structure of human CD81, a full-length tetraspanin. The transmembrane segments of CD81 pack as two largely separated pairs of helices, capped by the large extracellular loop (EC2) at the outer membrane leaflet. The two pairs of helices converge at the inner leaflet to create an intramembrane pocket with additional electron density corresponding to a bound cholesterol molecule within the cavity. Molecular dynamics simulations identify an additional conformation in which EC2 separates substantially from the transmembrane domain. Cholesterol binding appears to modulate CD81 activity in cells, suggesting a potential mechanism for regulation of tetraspanin function."

The 10-subunit KMN assembly (comprising KNL1, MIS12, and NDC80 complexes, designated KNL1C, MIS12C, and NDC80C) binds microtubules and regulates mitotic checkpoint function through NDC80C and KNL1C, respectively. MIS12C, on the other hand, connects the KMN to the chromosome-proximal domain of the kinetochore through a direct interaction with CENP-C. The structural basis for this crucial bridging function of MIS12C is unknown. Here, we report crystal structures of human MIS12C associated with a fragment of CENP-C and unveil the role of Aurora B kinase in the regulation of this interaction. The structure of MIS12:CENP-C complements previously determined high-resolution structures of functional regions of NDC80C and KNL1C and allows us to build a near-complete structural model of the KMN assembly.

https://openalex.org/W2542124795,"Kinetochores connect centromeric nucleosomes with mitotic-spindle microtubules through conserved, cross-interacting protein subassemblies. In budding yeast, the heterotetrameric MIND complex (Mtw1, Nnf1, Nsl1, Dsn1), ortholog of the metazoan Mis12 complex, joins the centromere-proximal components, Mif2 and COMA, with the principal microtubule-binding component, the Ndc80 complex (Ndc80C). We report the crystal structure of Kluyveromyces lactis MIND and examine its partner interactions, to understand the connection from a centromeric nucleosome to a much larger microtubule. MIND resembles an elongated, asymmetric Y; two globular heads project from a coiled-coil shaft. An N-terminal extension of Dsn1 from one head regulates interactions of the other head, blocking binding of Mif2 and COMA.

A range of behavioral modifications arises from motor learning, a process whereby sensory feedback is used to track the outcomes of actions, leading to adjustments of future motor commands to match outcome with intent. Multiple types of motor learning such as during limb coordination, reaching, and gaze stabilization are mediated by brain areas including the cerebellum, motor cortex, basal ganglia, and brainstem (Andalman and Fee, 2009Andalman A.S.

Neurosci. 2009; 12: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). Learning with what vigor to walk, swim, or fly to achieve a certain displacement is also essential for survival. The relationship between locomotor commands in the brain and the eventual displacement of the body in the environment is subject to frequent changes both in bodily properties such as muscle temperature or fatigue, and in environmental properties like water viscosity, terrain firmness, or wind. It is largely unknown which neural circuits underlie such forms of learning (Ahrens et al., 2012Ahrens M.B. Li J.M. Orger M.B. Robson D.N. Schier A.F. Engert F. Portugues R. Brain-wide neuronal dynamics during motor adaptation in zebrafish.Nature. 2012; 485: 471-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, Portugues and Engert, 2011Portugues R. Engert F. Adaptive locomotor behavior in larval zebrafish.Front. Syst. Neurosci. 2011; 5: 72Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and by what mechanisms they mediate these processes. Larval zebrafish swim in discrete bouts during which they must accurately traverse a desired distance. For example, when swimming against a water current to avoid being swept to potentially dangerous places, the distance traveled during a swim bout must be matched to the distance moved by the water current between bouts. However, the relationship between the strength of a neural swim command and the resulting distance swum, termed “motosensory gain,” is subject to changing properties of an animal’s body and environment. Larval zebrafish solve this tuning problem by adjusting “locomotor drive”—the number of action potentials at the neuromuscular junction during a swim bout—to compensate for changes in motosensory gain (Ahrens et al., 2012Ahrens M.B. Li J.M. Orger M.B. Robson D.N. Schier A.F. Engert F. Portugues R. Brain-wide neuronal dynamics during motor adaptation in zebrafish.Nature. 2012; 485: 471-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, Portugues and Engert, 2011Portugues R. Engert F. Adaptive locomotor behavior in larval zebrafish.Front. Syst. Neurosci. 2011; 5: 72Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Further, as in all forms of motor learning, it is advantageous for animals to retain adapted locomotor drive for some time so that they do not have to re-adapt after every time they pause moving. Indeed, after sustained exposure to a given motosensory gain, larval zebrafish retain their adapted locomotor drive for extended periods of time (Ahrens et al., 2012Ahrens M.B. Li J.M. Orger M.B. Robson D.N. Schier A.F. Engert F. Portugues R. Brain-wide neuronal dynamics during motor adaptation in zebrafish.Nature. 2012; 485: 471-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Here, we identified, at the neural level, the operations and their loci underlying this form of short-term locomotor learning. Because it was unknown which brain areas were involved, we performed whole-brain neuronal activity imaging during fictive behavior in a virtual reality environment (Vladimirov et al., 2014Vladimirov N. Mu Y. Kawashima T. Bennett D.V. Yang C.-T. Looger L.L. Keller P.J. Freeman J. Ahrens M.B. Light-sheet functional imaging in fictively behaving zebrafish.Nat. Methods. 2014; 11: 883-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). This screen implicated the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) of the central serotonergic system, an area previously associated with a variety of emotive, sensory, and motor functions (Dayan and Huys, 2015Dayan P. Huys Q. Serotonin’s many meanings elude simple theories.eLife. 2015; 4: e07390Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We show that the DRN mediates short-term locomotor learning and present evidence that (1) DRN circuits detect self-generated movement consequences by motor-gated sensory coding in phasic neuronal activity, (2) the DRN stores information about movement consequences in persistent neuronal firing, and (3) it shapes future motor output by serotonergic modulation of downstream circuits. To engage neural circuits participating in short-term motor learning, we placed paralyzed larval zebrafish in a virtual reality environment in which they fictively swim up a virtual stream in a one-dimensional track (Ahrens et al., 2012Ahrens M.B. Li J.M. Orger M.B. Robson D.N. Schier A.F. Engert F. Portugues R. Brain-wide neuronal dynamics during motor adaptation in zebrafish.Nature. 2012; 485: 471-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, Vladimirov et al., 2014Vladimirov N. Mu Y. Kawashima T. Bennett D.V. Yang C.-T. Looger L.L. Keller P.J. Freeman J. Ahrens M.B. Light-sheet functional imaging in fictively behaving zebrafish.Nat. Methods. 2014; 11: 883-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) (Figures 1A and 1B ). The stream is simulated by slow forward visual flow, which encourages swimming (Orger et al., 2008Orger M.B. Kampff A.R. Severi K.E. Bollmann J.H. Engert F. Control of visually guided behavior by distinct populations of spinal projection neurons.Nat. Neurosci. 2008; 11: 327-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), as though the animal is trying to stay stationary relative to the visual surroundings. We record swim bouts electrically as activity in motor neuron axons in the tail (Ahrens et al., 2012Ahrens M.B. Li J.M. Orger M.B. Robson D.N. Schier A.F. Engert F. Portugues R. Brain-wide neuronal dynamics during motor adaptation in zebrafish.Nature. 2012; 485: 471-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, Masino and Fetcho, 2005Masino M.A. Fetcho J.R. Fictive swimming motor patterns in wild type and mutant larval zebrafish.J. Neurophysiol. 2005; 93: 3177-3188Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). When a “fictive swim bout” is detected, we simulate the visual effect of forward swimming by thrusting the visual environment backward (Figure 1B). The velocity of this “movement” is proportional to the locomotor drive (that we measure from the tail as above) and is scaled by the visual motosensory gain (that we manipulate). Locomotor drive is an approximation of the number of spikes arriving at the neuromuscular junction of tail muscles during a swim bout. In nature, the motosensory gain (i.e., the amount of forward movement of the fish per unit of locomotor drive) varies due to muscle fatigue, muscle temperature, injury, changes in water viscosity, etc. These effects are simulated by manipulating the motosensory gain in virtual reality. Thus, [forward visual flow velocity] = [virtual stream velocity] – [locomotor drive] × [motosensory gain]. Fish rapidly adapt to changes in motosensory gain by adjusting locomotor drive to approximately equalize the travel distance induced by each swim bout (Figure 1C) (Ahrens et al., 2012Ahrens M.B. Li J.M. Orger M.B. Robson D.N. Schier A.F. Engert F. Portugues R. Brain-wide neuronal dynamics during motor adaptation in zebrafish.Nature. 2012; 485: 471-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, Portugues and Engert, 2011Portugues R. Engert F. Adaptive locomotor behavior in larval zebrafish.Front. Syst. Neurosci. 2011; 5: 72Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This adjustment persists for tens of seconds, even after a “delay” period (detailed below) during which the fish does not swim. Thus fish retain a “motor memory” associated with the gain they were exposed to. To probe mechanisms of motor learning, we developed a paradigm (Figure 1D) consisting of an initialization period in which 20 s of low motosensory gain is used to bring locomotor drive to a high baseline level, a training period of high motosensory gain to which the fish adjusts by attenuating locomotor drive, a delay period in which we apply 10 s of a constant visual stimulus that stops the animal from swimming, and a test period of 5 s to probe the extent to which the attenuated locomotor drive persists through the delay period. During the test period, an intermediate level of motosensory gain is applied. Figure 1E illustrates the basic effect: that training-induced adaptation of locomotor drive persists beyond the delay period (all traces, test period) (Ahrens et al., 2012Ahrens M.B. Li J.M. Orger M.B. Robson D.N. Schier A.F. Engert F. Portugues R. Brain-wide neuronal dynamics during motor adaptation in zebrafish.Nature. 2012; 485: 471-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). This “motor memory” has several properties. The effect decays over tens of seconds (Figure S1A); we therefore refer to it as “short-term.” Additionally, longer training periods (Figure 1E) result in stronger attenuation of locomotor drive both during the first swim bout of the test period (Figure 1F, center) as well as throughout the test period (Figure 1F, left). This property was robust enough to provide good statistical power for assessing the effects of subsequent experimental manipulations; thus we quantified the “learning effect” by the dependence of the test-period locomotor drive on the training duration. Notably, locomotor drive was the same at the end of the different training durations (Figures 1E, 1F, and S1B). Thus, while real-time adaptation changed behavior quickly, the learning effect built up more slowly. The time to first swim bout in the test period was unaffected (Figures 1E, 1F, and S1C) suggesting that the training does not affect reactivity in general. Furthermore, the effect generalized to turning responses to sideways moving gratings and swim responses to a darkening stimulus (Burgess and Granato, 2007Burgess H.A. Granato M. Modulation of locomotor activity in larval zebrafish during light adaptation.J. Exp. Biol. 2007; 210: 2526-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) in the test period (Figures S1D–S1I), where reaction time and response probability were similarly unaffected (Figures S1F and S1I), indicating an effect specific to motor vigor rather than general reactivity. Finally, the effect is not due to low levels of motor output inducing a prolonged state of torpor, because longer delay periods resulted in greater locomotor drive (Figure S1A). To find loci mediating the persistent effects of learning, we performed whole-brain calcium imaging in larval zebrafish (Freeman et al., 2014Freeman J. Vladimirov N. Kawashima T. Mu Y. Sofroniew N.J. Bennett D.V. Rosen J. Yang C.-T. Looger L.L. Ahrens M.B. Mapping brain activity at scale with cluster computing.Nat.

Light-sheet functional imaging in fictively behaving zebrafish.Nat. Methods. 2014; 11: 883-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) in the motor learning paradigm (Figures 1A and 1E; Movie S1). The animals performed the task efficiently both with and without the scan laser present. The fish expressed the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6f (Chen et al., 2013Chen T.-W. Wardill T.J. Sun Y. Pulver S.R. Renninger S.L. Baohan A. Schreiter E.R. Kerr R.A. Orger M.B. Jayaraman V. et al.Ultrasensitive fluorescent proteins for imaging neuronal activity.Nature. 2013; 499: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (3617) Google Scholar) in almost all neurons, localized to cell nuclei (Tg(elavl3:H2B-GCaMP6f)jf7). We automatically segmented the brain of each fish into 75,000–120,000 neurons (Figures S2A and S2B) and analyzed their activity (represented by fluorescence of the calcium indicator, ΔF/F). Simultaneous electrophysiological and optical recordings showed that the half decay time of the indicator was ∼2 s (Figures S2C and S2D). We applied a brainwide analysis to identify neurons that store a memory of the training as persistent neural activity during the delay period, a model based on previous studies of working memory (Machens et al., 2005Machens C.K.

Aksay E. Tank D.W. Spatial gradients and multidimensional dynamics in a neural integrator circuit.Nat. Neurosci. 2011; 14: 1150-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Specifically, we postulated that the extent to which a neuron stores the learning effect is related to two properties of its delay-period activity: (1) the degree to which its average activity during the delay period is related in a graded manner to the duration of the training period (Figure 1G, (1)), as longer training leads to a stronger learning effect; and (2) the trial-by-trial correlation between the neural activity during the delay period and the locomotor drive in the subsequent test period (Figure 1G, (2)), as the learning should affect future behavior. We generated whole-brain functional maps of neurons whose parameters (1) and (2) exceeded threshold values in the subset of fish (6 out of 12) behaviorally exhibiting the strongest learning effect. We found a density of such “learning-effect-encoding neurons” in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) (Figure 1H, arrowhead), a major serotonergic center in the vertebrate brain, located rostrally in the cluster of serotonergic nuclei in the zebrafish brainstem (Figure S3A) (Lillesaar et al., 2009Lillesaar C.

The dorsal raphe modulates sensory responsiveness during arousal in zebrafish.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 15205-15215Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In fish with weak or no learning effect, there were few neurons whose parameters (1) and (2) exceeded threshold values (Figure S3B). To understand the signals driving DRN activity during training, we performed fast (30 Hz) light-sheet imaging of DRN neurons expressing GCaMP6f (Chen et al., 2013Chen T.-W. Wardill T.J. Sun Y. Pulver S.R. Renninger S.L. Baohan A. Schreiter E.R. Kerr R.A. Orger M.B.

To investigate neural coding during closed-loop behavior, we first extracted neurons that showed elevated activity in the presence of closed-loop feedback relative to open-loop forward-moving gratings (Figures S4A–S4C). These DRN neurons responded phasically (within ∼800 ms) after each swim event (Figures 2B and S4D). Most of these (68% ± 6%, mean ± SEM across 21 fish) were monophasically activated after swim onset (Figure 2B, “group 1 neurons”). A smaller population of neurons (32% ± 6%) were initially suppressed and then gradually activated until the onset of the next swim bout (Figure S4D, “group 2 neurons”).Figure S4Whole-Brain Map of Neurons that Are Responsive to Closed-Loop Visual Feedback, and Activity Patterns of Group 2 DRN Neurons, Related to Figures 2 and 3Show full caption(A) The behavioral task for identifying neurons activated by closed-loop sensory feedback.

Do these DRN neurons’ phasic responses represent swim motor commands, visual motion, or a combination of visual and motor signals (Niell and Stryker, 2010Niell C.M. Stryker M.P.

Jayaraman V. Feature detection and orientation tuning in the Drosophila central complex.Nature. 2013; 503: 262-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar)? We measured DRN responses in a “stochastic gain paradigm” where we randomly changed the motosensory gain at every swim bout, so we could independently assess the coding of motor and visual variables (Figure 2C). With randomized motosensory gain, the fish does not have time to substantially adapt, and average levels of locomotor drive across different gains are equalized. By selecting a small range of locomotor drive and inspecting how DRN neurons coded for the visual stimulus (Figure 2D, horizontal box), we found that average DRN phasic responses increased with the velocity of visual motion (Figures 2E and S4E). Conversely, by selecting a narrow range of visual velocities (Figure 2D, vertical box), we found that average DRN responses were invariant across levels of motor output (Figure 2F). These results show that, during swim bouts, subsets of DRN neurons phasically encode the speed of visual motion. Critical to learning the relationship between motor output and sensory consequences is the ability to distinguish self-generated sensory feedback from externally generated sensory input. We asked whether DRN neurons respond to visual flow in general, or preferentially to visual flow that is temporally coupled to motor action (Figure 3A), using a closed-loop/open-loop paradigm. First, the fish swam for 20 s in closed-loop under a fixed motosensory gain. Next, the same 20-s sequence of visual motion was replayed in open-loop (i.e., irrespective of fictive swimming, Figure S4F). Thus, during replay periods, swim bouts and visual flow were decoupled (Figure 3B), allowing us to determine whether DRN activation depended on their relative timing (Figure 3C). When visual flow occurred right after swim onset, DRN responses were stronger than when visual input and motor output were sufficiently desynchronized (example neuron in Figure 3C; average in Figure 3D). By contrast, in an area of the optic tectum that is also active during closed-loop swimming (Figure S4C), average visual responses were not significantly modulated by the co-occurrence of swim bouts (Figure 3D). Thus, a subset of DRN neurons preferentially responds to visual input that is self-generated and responds little to stimuli that arise from external sources—a key operation required for motor learning.

https://openalex.org/W2549760434,"Clostridium difficile is one of the most important human and animal pathogens. However, the bacterium is ubiquitous and can be isolated from various sources. Here we report the prevalence and characterization of C. difficile in less studied environmental samples, puddle water (n = 104) and soil (n = 79). C. difficile was detected in 14.4% of puddle water and in 36.7% of soil samples. Environmental strains displayed antimicrobial resistance patterns comparable to already published data of human and animal isolates. A total of 480 isolates were grouped into 34 different PCR ribotypes. More than half of these (52.9%; 18 of 34) were already described in humans or animals. However, 14 PCR ribotypes were new in our PCR ribotype library and all but one were non-toxigenic. The multilocus sequence analysis of these new PCR ribotypes revealed that non-toxigenic environmental isolates are phylogenetically distinct and belong to three highly divergent clades, two of which have not been described before. Our data suggest that environment is a potential reservoir of genetically diverse population of C. difficile."
https://openalex.org/W2551895176,"Nanomaterials may be contaminated with bacterial endotoxin during production and handling, which may confound toxicological testing of these materials, not least when assessing for immunotoxicity. In the present study, we evaluated the conventional Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) assay for endotoxin detection in graphene based material (GBM) samples, including graphene oxide (GO) and few-layered graphene (FLG). Our results showed that some GO samples interfered with various formats of the LAL assay. To overcome this problem, we developed a TNF-α expression test (TET) using primary human monocyte-derived macrophages incubated in the presence or absence of the endotoxin inhibitor, polymyxin B sulfate, and found that this assay, performed with non-cytotoxic doses of the GBM samples, enabled unequivocal detection of endotoxin with a sensitivity that is comparable to the LAL assay. FLG also triggered TNF-α production in the presence of the LPS inhibitor, pointing to an intrinsic pro-inflammatory effect. Finally, we present guidelines for the preparation of endotoxin-free GO, validated by using the TET."
https://openalex.org/W2552032035,"Automatic classification of animal vocalizations has great potential to enhance the monitoring of species movements and behaviors. This is particularly true for monitoring nocturnal bird migration, where automated classification of migrants’ flight calls could yield new biological insights and conservation applications for birds that vocalize during migration. In this paper we investigate the automatic classification of bird species from flight calls, and in particular the relationship between two different problem formulations commonly found in the literature: classifying a short clip containing one of a fixed set of known species (N-class problem) and the continuous monitoring problem, the latter of which is relevant to migration monitoring. We implemented a state-of-the-art audio classification model based on unsupervised feature learning and evaluated it on three novel datasets, one for studying the N-class problem including over 5000 flight calls from 43 different species, and two realistic datasets for studying the monitoring scenario comprising hundreds of thousands of audio clips that were compiled by means of remote acoustic sensors deployed in the field during two migration seasons. We show that the model achieves high accuracy when classifying a clip to one of N known species, even for a large number of species. In contrast, the model does not perform as well in the continuous monitoring case. Through a detailed error analysis (that included full expert review of false positives and negatives) we show the model is confounded by varying background noise conditions and previously unseen vocalizations. We also show that the model needs to be parameterized and benchmarked differently for the continuous monitoring scenario. Finally, we show that despite the reduced performance, given the right conditions the model can still characterize the migration pattern of a specific species. The paper concludes with directions for future research."
https://openalex.org/W2550513796,"Cardiotoxicity is a limiting factor of doxorubicin (DOX)-based anticancer therapy. Due to its beneficial effects, we investigated whether standardized extract of Melissa officinalis (MO) can attenuate doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity and can potentiate the efficacy of DOX against human breast cancer cells. MO was administered orally to male albino rats once daily for 10 consecutive days at doses of 250, 500 and 750 mg/kg b.wt. DOX (15 mg/kg b.wt. i.p.) was administered on the 8th day. MO protected against DOX-induced leakage of cardiac enzymes and histopathological changes. MO ameliorated DOX-induced oxidative stress as evidenced by decreasing lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation and total oxidant capacity depletion and by increasing antioxidant capacity. Additionally, MO pretreatment inhibited inflammatory responses to DOX by decreasing the expressions of nuclear factor kappa-B, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and cyclooxygenase-2 and the activity of myeloperoxidase. MO ameliorated DOX-induced apoptotic tissue damage in heart of rats. In vitro study showed that MO augmented the anticancer efficacy of DOX in human breast cancer cells (MCF-7) and potentiated oxidative damage and apoptosis. Thus, combination of DOX and MO may prove future cancer treatment protocols safer and more efficient."
https://openalex.org/W2553039306,"Introduction Low-calorie sweetener use for weight control has come under increasing scrutiny as obesity, especially abdominal obesity, remain entrenched despite substantial low-calorie sweetener use. We evaluated whether chronic low-calorie sweetener use is a risk factor for abdominal obesity. Participants and Methods We used 8268 anthropometric measurements and 3096 food diary records with detailed information on low-calorie sweetener consumption in all food products, from 1454 participants (741 men, 713 women) in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging collected from 1984 to 2012 with median follow-up of 10 years (range: 0–28 years). At baseline, 785 were low-calorie sweetener non-users (51.7% men) and 669 participants were low-calorie sweetener users (50.1% men). Time-varying low-calorie sweetener use was operationalized as the proportion of visits since baseline at which low-calorie sweetener use was reported. We used marginal structural models to determine the association between baseline and time-varying low-calorie sweetener use with longitudinal outcomes—body mass index, waist circumference, obesity and abdominal obesity—with outcome status assessed at the visit following low-calorie sweetener ascertainment to minimize the potential for reverse causality. All models were adjusted for year of visit, age, sex, age by sex interaction, race, current smoking status, dietary intake (caffeine, fructose, protein, carbohydrate, and fat), physical activity, diabetes status, and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension score as confounders. Results With median follow-up of 10 years, low-calorie sweetener users had 0.80 kg/m2 higher body mass index (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.17–1.44), 2.6 cm larger waist circumference (95% CI, 0.71–4.39), 36.7% higher prevalence (prevalence ratio = 1.37; 95% CI, 1.10–1.69) and 53% higher incidence (hazard ratio = 1.53; 95% CI 1.10–2.12) of abdominal obesity than low-calorie sweetener non-users. Conclusions Low-calorie sweetener use is independently associated with heavier relative weight, a larger waist, and a higher prevalence and incidence of abdominal obesity suggesting that low-calorie sweetener use may not be an effective means of weight control."
https://openalex.org/W2549839096,"The recent world financial crisis has increased the number of bankruptcies in numerous countries and has resulted in a new area of research which responds to the need to predict this phenomenon, not only at the level of individual countries, but also at a global level, offering explanations of the common characteristics shared by the affected companies. Nevertheless, few studies focus on the prediction of bankruptcies globally. In order to compensate for this lack of empirical literature, this study has used a methodological framework of logistic regression to construct predictive bankruptcy models for Asia, Europe and America, and other global models for the whole world. The objective is to construct a global model with a high capacity for predicting bankruptcy in any region of the world. The results obtained have allowed us to confirm the superiority of the global model in comparison to regional models over periods of up to three years prior to bankruptcy."
https://openalex.org/W2553641263,"Objective IL-15 has been postulated to play an important role in HIV-1 infection, yet there are conflicting reports regarding its expression levels in these patients. We sought to measure the level of IL-15 in a large, well characterised cohort of HIV-1 infected patients and correlate this with well known markers of inflammation, including CRP, D-dimer, sCD163 and sCD14. Design and Methods IL-15 levels were measured in 501 people (460 patients with HIV-1 infection and 41 uninfected controls). The HIV-1 infected patients were divided into 4 groups based on viral load: <50 copies/ml, 51–10,000 copies/ml, 10,001–100,000 copies/ml and >100,000 copies/ml. The Mann Whitney test (non-parametric) was used to identify significant relationships between different patient groups. Results IL-15 levels were significantly higher in patients with viral loads >100,000 copies/ml (3.02 ± 1.53 pg/ml) compared to both uninfected controls (1.69 ± 0.37 pg/ml, p<0.001) or patients with a viral load <50 copies/ml (1.59 ± 0.40 pg/ml (p<0.001). There was a significant correlation between HIV-1 viremia and IL-15 levels (Spearman r = 0.54, p<0.001) and between CD4+ T cell counts and IL-15 levels (Spearman r = -0.56, p<0.001). Conclusions IL-15 levels are significantly elevated in HIV-1 infected patients with viral loads >100,000 copies/ml compared to uninfected controls, with a significant direct correlation noted between IL-15 and HIV-1 viremia and an inverse correlation between IL-15 levels and CD4+ T cell counts. These data support a potential role for IL-15 in the pathogenesis of HIV-associated immune activation."
https://openalex.org/W2555110154,"Quantitative PCR methods are commonly used to monitor enteric viruses in the aquatic environment because of their high sensitivity, short reaction times and relatively low operational cost. However, conclusions for public health drawn from results of such molecular techniques are limited due to their inability to determine viral infectivity. Ethidium monoazide (EMA) and propidium monoazide (PMA) are capable to penetrate the damaged or compromised capsid of the inactivated viruses and bind to the viral nucleic acids. We assessed whether dye treatment is a suitable approach to improve the ability of qPCR to distinguish between infectious and non-infectious human adenovirus, enterovirus and rotavirus A in surface water of an urban river and sewage before and after UV disinfection. Like the gold standard of cell culture assays, pretreatment EMA-/PMA-qPCR succeeded in removing false positive results which would lead to an overestimation of the viral load if only qPCR of the environmental samples was considered. A dye pretreatment could therefore provide a rapid and relatively inexpensive tool to improve the efficacy of molecular quantification methods in regards to viral infectivity."
https://openalex.org/W2556225609,"Background HIV prevalence among female sex workers (FSWs) in India remains well above the national average. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a new HIV prevention technology, may help to reduce HIV incidence, but there is a dearth of research that can inform the potential scale-up of PrEP in India. In partnership with Ashodaya Samithi, a local sex worker collective, we conducted a feasibility study to assess acceptance of a planned PrEP demonstration project, willingness to use PrEP, and recommendations for project roll-out among FSWs in southern Karnataka. Methods From January–April 2015, 6 focus group discussions, 47 in-depth interviews, and 427 interviewer-administered questionnaires were completed by female sex workers. All participants were 18 years of age or older and practiced sex work. Qualitative data were coded for key themes and emergent categories. Univariate descriptive analysis was employed to summarise the quantitative data. Results Qualitative. PrEP was described as an exciting new prevention technology that places control in the hands of FSWs and provides a “double safety” in combination with condom use. Participants expressed agreement that women who may experience more HIV risk in their occupational environments should be prioritized for enrollment into a demonstration project. Quantitative. 406 participants (95%) expressed interest in PrEP. Participants prioritized the inclusion of FSWs under the age of 25 (79%), those who do not use condoms when clients offer more money (58%), who do not consistently use condoms with regular partners (57%), who drink alcohol regularly (49%), and who do not use condoms consistently with clients (48%). Discussion This feasibility study indicated strong interest in PrEP and a desire to move forward with the demonstration project. Participants expressed their responses in terms of public health discourses surrounding risk, pointing to the importance of situating PrEP scale up within the trusted spaces of community-based organizations as a means of supporting PrEP uptake and adherence."
https://openalex.org/W2557038312,"In contrast to the mammalian retina, the zebrafish retina exhibits the potential for lifelong retinal neurogenesis and regeneration even after severe damage. Previous studies have shown that the transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) signaling pathway is activated during the regeneration of different tissues in the zebrafish and is needed for regeneration in the heart and the fin. In this study, we have investigated the role of the TGFβ pathway in the N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU)-induced chemical model of rod photoreceptor de- and regeneration in adult zebrafish. Immunohistochemical staining for phosphorylated Smad3 was elevated during retinal regeneration, and phosphorylated Smad3 co-localized with proliferating cell nuclear antigen and glutamine synthetase, indicating TGFβ pathway activation in proliferating Müller glia. Inhibiting the TGFβ signaling pathway using a small molecule inhibitor (SB431542) resulted in accelerated recovery from retinal degeneration. Accordingly, we observed increased cell proliferation in the outer nuclear layer at days 3 to 8 after MNU treatment. In contrast to the observations in the heart and the fin, the inhibition of the TGFβ signaling pathway resulted in increased proliferation after the induction of retinal degeneration. A better understanding of the underlying pathways with the possibility to boost retinal regeneration in adult zebrafish may potentially help to stimulate such proliferation also in other species."
https://openalex.org/W2557168308,"Objectives The aim of this study was to describe dietary intake and eating behaviours of obese children and adolescents, and also to determine how these differ in Indigenous versus non-Indigenous children at enrolment in an obesity programme. Methods Baseline dietary intake and eating behaviour records were assessed from those enrolled in a clinical unblinded randomised controlled trial of a multi-disciplinary intervention. The setting was a community-based obesity programme in Taranaki, New Zealand. Children or adolescents who were enrolled from January 2012 to August 2014, with a BMI ≥98th percentile or >91st centile with weight-related comorbidities were eligible. Results 239 participants (45% Māori, 45% NZ Europeans, 10% other ethnicities), aged 5–17 years were assessed. Two-thirds of participants experienced hyperphagia and half were not satiated after a meal. Comfort eating was reported by 62% of participants, and daily energy intake was above the recommended guidelines for 54%. Fruit and vegetable intake was suboptimal compared with the recommended 5 servings per day (mean 3.5 [SD = 1.9] servings per day), and the mean weekly breakfasts were less than the national average (5.9 vs 6.5; p<0.0001). Median sweet drink intake amongst Māori was twice that of NZ Europeans (250 vs 125 ml per day; p = 0.0002). Conclusions There was a concerning prevalence of abnormal eating behaviours and significant differences in dietary intake between obese participants and their national counterparts. Ethnic differences between Indigenous and non-Indigenous participants were also present, especially in relation to sweet drink consumption. Eating behaviours, especially sweet drink consumption and fruit/vegetable intake need to be addressed."
https://openalex.org/W2553337169,"The use of antiemetics for vomiting in acute gastroenteritis in children is still a matter of debate. We conducted a double-blind randomized trial to evaluate whether a single oral dose of ondansetron vs domperidone or placebo improves outcomes in children with gastroenteritis. After failure of initial oral rehydration administration, children aged 1-6 years admitted for gastroenteritis to the pediatric emergency departments of 15 hospitals in Italy were randomized to receive one oral dose of ondansetron (0.15 mg/kg) or domperidone (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo. The primary outcome was the percentage of children receiving nasogastric or intravenous rehydration. A p value of 0.014 was used to indicate statistical significance (and 98.6% CI were calculated) as a result of having carried out two interim analyses. 1,313 children were eligible for the first attempt with oral rehydration solution, which was successful for 832 (63.4%); 356 underwent randomization (the parents of 125 children did not give consent): 118 to placebo, 119 to domperidone, and 119 to ondansetron. Fourteen (11.8%) needed intravenous rehydration in the ondansetron group vs 30 (25.2%) and 34 (28.8%) in the domperidone and placebo groups, respectively. Ondansetron reduced the risk of intravenous rehydration by over 50%, both vs placebo (RR 0.41, 98.6% CI 0.20-0.83) and domperidone (RR 0.47, 98.6% CI 0.23-0.97). No differences for adverse events were seen among groups. In a context of emergency care, 6 out of 10 children aged 1-6 years with vomiting due to gastroenteritis and without severe dehydration can be managed effectively with administration of oral rehydration solution alone. In children who fail oral rehydration, a single oral dose of ondansetron reduces the need for intravenous rehydration and the percentage of children who continue to vomit, thereby facilitating the success of oral rehydration. Domperidone was not effective for the symptomatic treatment of vomiting during acute gastroenteritis."
https://openalex.org/W2551566207,"Early childhood anxiety disorders are common, impairing, and predictive of anxiety and mood disorders later in childhood. Epidemiological studies over the last decade find that the prevalence of impairing anxiety disorders in preschool children ranges from 0.3% to 6.5%. Yet, less than 15% of young children with an impairing anxiety disorder receive a mental health evaluation or treatment. One possible reason for the low rate of care for anxious preschoolers is the lack of affordable, timely, reliable and valid tools for identifying young children with clinically significant anxiety. Diagnostic interviews assessing psychopathology in young children require intensive training, take hours to administer and code, and are not available for use outside of research settings. The Preschool Age Psychiatric Assessment (PAPA) is a reliable and valid structured diagnostic parent-report interview for assessing psychopathology, including anxiety disorders, in 2 to 5 year old children. In this paper, we apply machine-learning tools to already collected PAPA data from two large community studies to identify sub-sets of PAPA items that could be developed into an efficient, reliable, and valid screening tool to assess a young child’s risk for an anxiety disorder. Using machine learning, we were able to decrease by an order of magnitude the number of items needed to identify a child who is at risk for an anxiety disorder with an accuracy of over 96% for both generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and separation anxiety disorder (SAD). Additionally, rather than considering GAD or SAD as discrete/binary entities, we present a continuous risk score representing the child’s risk of meeting criteria for GAD or SAD. Identification of a short question-set that assesses risk for an anxiety disorder could be a first step toward development and validation of a relatively short screening tool feasible for use in pediatric clinics and daycare/preschool settings."
https://openalex.org/W2552359508,"Schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease of a significant public health impact. The water rat Nectomys squamipes is one of the most important non-human hosts in the schistosomiasis mansoni transmission in Brazil, being considered a wild reservoir. Cellular mechanisms that contribute to the physiological adaptation of this rodent to the Schistosoma mansoni parasite are poorly understood. Here we identified, for the first time, that a hepatic steatosis, a condition characterized by excessive lipid accumulation with formation of lipid droplets (LDs) within hepatocytes, occurs in response to the natural S. mansoni infection of N. squamipes, captured in an endemic region. Significant increases of LD area in the hepatic tissue and LD numbers/hepatocyte, detected by quantitative histopathological and ultrastructural analyses, were paralleled by increased serum profile (total cholesterol and triglycerides) in infected compared to uninfected animals. Raman spectroscopy showed high content of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in the liver of both groups. MALDI-TOFF mass spectroscopy revealed an amplified pool of omega-6 PUFA arachidonic acid in the liver of infected animals. Assessment of liver functional activity by the levels of hepatic transaminases (ALT and AST) did not detect any alteration during the natural infection. In summary, this work demonstrates that the natural infection of the wild reservoir N. squamipes with S. mansoni elicits hepatic steatosis in the absence of liver functional harm and that accumulation of lipids, markedly PUFAs, coexists with low occurrence of inflammatory granulomatous processes, suggesting that lipid stores may be acting as a protective mechanism for dealing with the infection."
https://openalex.org/W2555675055,"Background Herpes zoster (HZ) is caused by reactivation of the latent varicella-zoster virus (VZV). A severe complication of HZ is VZV vasculopathy which can result in ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke. The aims of our study were to assess the risk of stroke after the onset of HZ and to investigate the roles of stroke subtype, HZ location and the time interval between HZ onset and stroke. Methods A self-controlled case-series study was performed on a cohort of patients with incident stroke recorded in the German Pharmacoepidemiological Research Database (GePaRD), which covers about 20 million persons throughout Germany. We estimated adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRR) by comparing the rate of stroke in risk periods (i.e., periods following HZ) with the rate of stroke in control periods (i.e., periods without HZ) in the same individuals, controlling for both time-invariant and major potentially time-variant confounders. Results The cohort included 124,462 stroke patients, of whom 6,035 (5%) had at least one HZ diagnosis identified in GePaRD either as main hospital discharge diagnosis or as HZ treated with antivirals. The risk of stroke was about 1.3 times higher in the risk periods 3 months after HZ onset, than in the control periods (IRR: 1.29; 95% confidence interval: 1.16–1.44). An elevated risk of similar magnitude was observed for ischemic and unspecified stroke, but a 1.5-fold higher risk was observed for hemorrhagic stroke. A slightly stronger effect on the risk of stroke was also observed during the 3 months after HZ ophthalmicus (HZO) onset (1.59; 1.10–2.32). The risk was highest 3 and 4 weeks after HZ onset and decreased thereafter. Conclusions Our study corroborates an increased risk of stroke after HZ, which is highest 3 to 4 weeks after HZ onset. The results suggest that the risk is more pronounced after HZO and is numerically higher for hemorrhagic than for ischemic stroke."
https://openalex.org/W2550426261,"The present work is aimed at evaluating the antitumour properties of a Pd(II) dinuclear complex with the biogenic polyamine spermine, by investigating: i) the anti-angiogenic and anti-migration properties of a Pd(II) dinuclear complex with spermine (Pd2Spm); ii) the anti-proliferative activity of Pd2Spm against a triple negative human breast carcinoma (MDA-MB-231); and finally iii) the putative interaction mediated by combination of Pd2Spm with Docetaxel. Anti-invasive (anti-angiogenic and anti-migratory) as well as anti-proliferative capacities were assessed, for different combination schemes and drug exposure times, using the CAM assay and VEGFR2 activity measurement, the MatrigelTM method and the SRB proliferation test. The results thus obtained evidence the ability of Pd2Spm to restrict angiogenesis and cell migration: Pd2Spm induced a marked inhibition of migration (43.8±12.2%), and a higher inhibition of angiogenesis (81.8±4.4% for total length values, at 4 μM) as compared to DTX at the clinical dosage 4x10-2 μM (26.4±14.4%; n = 4 to 11). Combination of Pd2Spm/DTX was more effective as anti-invasive and anti-proliferative than DTX or Pd2Spm in sole administration, which is compatible with the occurrence of synergism: for the anti-angiogenic effect, IC50(Pd2Spm/DTX) = 0.5/0.5x10-2 μM vs IC50(DTX) = 1.7x10-2 μM and IC50(Pd2Spm) = 1.6 μM. In conclusion, the reported effects of Pd2Spm on angiogenesis, migration and proliferation showed that this compound is a promising therapeutic agent against this type of breast cancer. Moreover, combined administration of Pd2Spm and DTX was found to trigger a substantial synergetic effect regarding angiogenesis inhibition as well as anti-migratory and anti-proliferative activities reinforcing the putative use of Pd(II) complexes in chemotherapeutic regimens. This is a significant outcome, aiming at the application of these combined strategies towards metastatic breast cancer (or other type of resistant cancers), justifying further studies that include pre-clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W2556247603,"Cardiac dysfunction caused by the impairment of myocardial contractility has been recognized as an important factor contributing to the high mortality in sepsis. Calpain activation in the heart takes place in response to increased intracellular calcium influx resulting in proteolysis of structural and contractile proteins with subsequent myocardial dysfunction. The purpose of the present study was to test the hypothesis that increased levels of calpain in the septic heart leads to disruption of structural and contractile proteins and that administration of calpain inhibitor-1 (N-acetyl-leucinyl-leucinyl-norleucinal (ALLN)) after sepsis induced by cecal ligation and puncture prevents cardiac protein degradation. We also tested the hypothesis that calpain plays a role in the modulation of protein synthesis/degradation through the activation of proteasome-dependent proteolysis and inhibition of the mTOR pathway. Severe sepsis significantly increased heart calpain-1 levels and promoted ubiquitin and Pa28β over-expression with a reduction in the mTOR levels. In addition, sepsis reduced the expression of structural proteins dystrophin and β-dystroglycan as well as the contractile proteins actin and myosin. ALLN administration prevented sepsis-induced increases in calpain and ubiquitin levels in the heart, which resulted in decreased of structural and contractile proteins degradation and basal mTOR expression levels were re-established. Our results support the concept that increased calpain concentrations may be part of an important mechanism of sepsis-induced cardiac muscle proteolysis."
https://openalex.org/W2555656840,"Background Some trials recently demonstrated the benefit of targeted treatment for malignant disease; therefore, adequate tissues are needed to detect the targeted gene. Pleural biopsy using flex-rigid pleuroscopy and pleural effusion cell block analysis are both useful for diagnosis of malignancy and obtaining adequate samples. The purpose of our study was to compare the diagnostic utility between the two methods among patients with malignant pleural disease with effusion. Methods Data from patients who underwent flex-rigid pleuroscopy for diagnosis of pleural effusion suspicious for malignancy at the National Cancer Center Hospital, Japan between April 2011 and June 2014 were retrospectively reviewed. All procedures were performed under local anesthesia. At least 150 mL of pleural fluid was collected by pleuroscopy, followed by pleural biopsies from the abnormal site. Results Thirty-five patients who were finally diagnosed as malignant pleural disease were included in this study. Final diagnoses of malignancy were 24 adenocarcinoma, 1 combined adeno-small cell carcinoma, and 7 malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), and 3 metastatic breast cancer. The diagnostic yield was significantly higher by pleural biopsy than by cell block [94.2% (33/35) vs. 71.4% (25/35); p = 0.008]. All patients with positive results on cell block also had positive results on pleural biopsy. Eight patients with negative results on cell block had positive results on pleural biopsy (lung adenocarcinoma in 4, sarcomatoid MPM in 3, and metastatic breast cancer in 1). Two patients with negative results on both cell block and pleural biopsy were diagnosed was sarcomatoid MPM by computed tomography-guided needle biopsy and epithelioid MPM by autopsy. Conclusion Pleural biopsy using flex-rigid pleuroscopy was efficient in the diagnosis of malignant pleural diseases. Flex-rigid pleuroscopy with pleural biopsy and pleural effusion cell block analysis should be considered as the initial diagnostic approach for malignant pleural diseases presenting with effusion."
https://openalex.org/W2551755549,"DNA methylation plays important roles in the production and functioning of spermatozoa. Recent studies have suggested that DNA methylation patterns in spermatozoa can change with age, but the regions susceptible to age-related methylation changes remain to be fully elucidated. In this study, we conducted genome-scale DNA methylation profiling of spermatozoa obtained from C57BL/6N mice at 8 weeks (8w), 18 weeks (18w) and 17 months of age (17m). There was no substantial difference in the global DNA methylation patterns between 18w and 17m samples except for a slight increase of methylation levels in long interspersed nuclear elements in the 17m samples. We found that maternally methylated imprinting control regions (mICRs) and spermatogenesis-related gene promoters had 5–10% higher methylation levels in 8w samples than in 18w or 17m samples. Analysis of individual sequence reads suggested that these regions were fully methylated (80–100%) in a subset of 8w spermatozoa. These regions are also known to be highly methylated in a subset of postnatal spermatogonia, which might be the source of the increased DNA methylation in 8w spermatozoa. Another possible source was contamination by somatic cells. Although we carefully purified the spermatozoa, it was difficult to completely exclude the possibility of somatic cell contamination. Further studies are needed to clarify the source of the small increase in DNA methylation in the 8w samples. Overall, our findings suggest that DNA methylation patterns in mouse spermatozoa are relatively stable throughout reproductive life."

Overall, the average annual CS delivery rate was 46.4% in Istanbul and 36.6% in Turkey. There was a significant increase in the CS rates in Istanbul and Turkey from 2008 to 2013 relative to those from 2002 to 2007 (p = 0.004). There was a statistically significant and inverse relationship (97.2%) between the MMR and CS rate from 2002 to 2013 in Turkey (p = 0.001). However, no significant relationship was detected between the MMR and CS rate from 2002 to 2013 in Istanbul (p > 0.05). There was a significant inverse correlation (66.3%) between the CS rate and peripartumhemorrhage in Turkey (p = 0.019) and there was a significant inverse correlation (66.5%) between the CS rate and peripartumhemorrhage(p = 0.018) in Istanbul between 2007 to 2013. There were no significant differences in ante-intrapartum haemorrhage bleeding (p > 0.05) or postpartum hemorrhage (p > 0.05) from 2007 to 2013.This study demonstrates that there was a inverse correlation between increased CS and maternal mortality rates during the previous decade in Turkey. Although cesarean rates increase excessively, it appears that improved health care facilities have a positive effect on MMRs in Turkey."

Consumption of certain foods such as fava beans, legumes; infection with bacteria or virus; and use of certain drugs such as primaquine, sulfa drugs etc. may result in lysis of RBCs in G6PD deficient individuals. The genetic defect that causes G6PD deficiency has been identified mostly as single base missense mutations. One hundred and sixty G6PD gene mutations, which lead to amino acid substitutions, have been described worldwide. The purpose of this study was to detect G6PD gene mutations in hospital-based settings in the local population of Dhaka city, Bangladesh. Qualitative fluorescent spot test and quantitative enzyme activity measurement using RANDOX G6PDH kit were performed for analysis of blood specimens and detection of G6PD-deficient participants. For G6PD-deficient samples, PCR was done with six sets of primers specific for G6PD gene. Automated Sanger sequencing of the PCR products was performed to identify the mutations in the gene. Based on fluorescence spot test and quantitative enzyme assay followed by G6PD gene sequencing, 12 specimens (11 males and one female) among 121 clinically suspected patient-specimens were found to be deficient, suggesting a frequency of 9.9% G6PD deficiency. Sequencing of the G6PD-deficient samples revealed c.C131G substitution (exon-3: Ala44Gly) in six samples, c.G487A substitution (exon-6:Gly163Ser) in five samples and c.G949A substitution (exon-9: Glu317Lys) of coding sequence in one sample. These mutations either affect NADP binding or disrupt protein structure. From the study it appears that Ala44Gly and Gly163Ser are the most common G6PD mutations in Dhaka, Bangladesh. This is the first study of G6PD mutations in Bangladesh."
https://openalex.org/W2555824188,"Background Reduced ankle–brachial index (ABI) is a predictor of cardiovascular events. However, the significance of high ABI remains poorly understood. This study aimed to assess the characteristics and outcomes of patients with high ABI. Methods The IMPACT-ABI study was a retrospective cohort study that enrolled and examined ABI in 3,131 patients hospitalized for cardiovascular disease between January 2005 and December 2012. From this cohort, 2,419 patients were identified and stratified into two groups: high ABI (> 1.4; 2.6%) and normal ABI (1.0–1.4; 97.3%). The primary endpoint was the cumulative incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), including cardiovascular-associated death, myocardial infarction, and stroke. Results Compared with the normal ABI group, patients in the high ABI group showed significantly lower body mass index (BMI) and hemoglobin level, but had higher incidence of chronic kidney disease and hemodialysis. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that hemodialysis was the strongest predictor of high ABI (odds ratio, 6.18; 95% confidence interval (CI), 3.05–12.52; P < 0.001). During the follow-up (median, 4.7 years), 172 cases of MACE occurred. Cumulative MACE incidence in patients with high ABI was significantly increased compared to that in those with normal ABI (32.5% vs. 14.5%; P = 0.005). In traditional cardiovascular risk factors-adjusted multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis, high ABI was an independent predictor of MACE (hazard ratio, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.02–4.20; P = 0.044). Conclusion Lower BMI, chronic kidney disease, and hemodialysis are more frequent in patients with high ABI. Hemodialysis is the strongest predictor of high ABI. High ABI is a parameter that independently predicts MACE."
https://openalex.org/W2549616557,"The mechanism associated with improvement of soil nutritional status by oilseed rape crop, leading to better performance of rice crop, in rice-oilseed rape cropping systems is little known. The present study was aimed to test the hypothesis that earthworm casts produced during oilseed rape-growing season have positive effects on grain yield and fertilizer nitrogen (N) utilization in the subsequent flooded rice crop. A 15N-tracing pot experiment was conducted to determine the effects of earthworm casts collected from oilseed rape fields on yield attributes in rice and the fate of fertilizer N. Soil treated with earthworm casts (soil: earthworm casts = 4: 1, w/w) (EC1) produced 39% higher grain yield than soil only (EC0). EC1 had 18% more panicle number and 10% higher spikelet filling percentage than EC0. Aboveground biomass and harvest index were higher in EC1 than in EC0 by 20% and 15%, respectively. SPAD values in flag leaves were 10% and 22% higher under EC1 than EC0 at 15 and 20 days after heading, respectively. EC1 had 19% higher total N uptake and 18% higher physiological N-use efficiency than EC0. These positive effects of earthworm casts on yield attributes offset negative effects of decreasing N rate from 0.74 g pot-1 (equivalent to the recommended field rate of 150 kg ha-1) to 0.44 g pot-1 (equivalent to 60% of the recommended rate). Fertilizer N retention rate was 7% higher while fertilizer N loss rate was 6% lower in EC1 than in EC0. Our study suggests that earthworm casts produced during oilseed rape-growing season are expected to have the following benefits on the subsequent flooded rice system: (1) improving growth and physiological processes in rice plants and consequently increasing rice grain yield, and (2) increasing fertilizer N retention rate and hence decreasing fertilizer N loss rate and reducing environmental risk."
https://openalex.org/W2550508450,"The academic debate on cross-cultural interaction within the context of end-of-life care takes for granted that this interaction is challenging. However, few empirical studies have actually focused on what health care professionals think about this interaction. This study aimed to explore health care professionals' understandings of cross-cultural interaction during end-of-life care.Sixty end-of-life care professionals were recruited from eleven care units in Sweden to take part in focus group interviews. These interviews were analyzed using qualitative content analysis.The health care professionals interviewed talked about cross-cultural interaction in end-of-life care as interaction that brings about uncertainty, stress and frustration even though they had limited experience of this type of interaction. The focus group discussions brought attention to four specific challenges that they expected to meet when they care for patients with migrant backgrounds since they took for granted that they would have an ethno-cultural background that is different to their own. These challenges had to do with communication barriers, 'unusual' emotional and pain expressions, the expectation that these patients' families would be 'different' and the anticipation that these patients and their families lack knowledge. At the core of the challenges in question is the idea that cross-cultural interaction means meeting ""the unknown"". In addition, the end-of-life care professionals interviewed talked about patients whose backgrounds they did not share in homogenizing terms. It is against this backdrop that they worried about their ability to provide end-of-life care that is individualized enough to meet the needs of these patients.The study suggests that end-of-life care professionals who regard cross-cultural interaction in this manner could face actual challenges when caring for patients whose backgrounds they regard as ""the unknown"" since they anticipate a variety of challenges and do not seem confident enough that they can provide good quality care when cross-cultural interaction is at stake."
https://openalex.org/W2552498621,"Escherichia coli O157:H7 is responsible for severe diarrhea and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), and predominantly affects children under 5 years. The major virulence traits are Shiga toxins, necessary to develop HUS and the Type III Secretion System (T3SS) through which bacteria translocate effector proteins directly into the host cell. By SNPs typing, E. coli O157:H7 was separated into nine different clades. Clade 8 and clade 6 strains were more frequently associated with severe disease and HUS. In this study, we aimed to identify differentially expressed proteins in two strains of E. coli O157:H7 (clade 8 and clade 6), obtained from cattle and compared them with the well characterized reference EDL933 strain (clade 3). Clade 8 and clade 6 strains show enhanced pathogenicity in a mouse model and virulence-related properties. Proteins were extracted and analyzed using the TMT-6plex labeling strategy associated with two dimensional liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry in tandem. We detected 2241 proteins in the cell extract and 1787 proteins in the culture supernatants. Attention was focused on the proteins related to virulence, overexpressed in clade 6 and 8 strains compared to EDL933 strain. The proteins relevant overexpressed in clade 8 strain were the curli protein CsgC, a transcriptional activator (PchE), phage proteins, Stx2, FlgM and FlgD, a dienelactone hydrolase, CheW and CheY, and the SPATE protease EspP. For clade 6 strain, a high overexpression of phage proteins was detected, mostly from Stx2 encoding phage, including Stx2, flagellin and the protease TagA, EDL933_p0016, dienelactone hydrolase, and Haemolysin A, amongst others with unknown function. Some of these proteins were analyzed by RT-qPCR to corroborate the proteomic data. Clade 6 and clade 8 strains showed enhanced transcription of 10 out of 12 genes compared to EDL933. These results may provide new insights in E. coli O157:H7 mechanisms of pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2549772482,"Objective The study examined potential changes in the proportion of metabolic health according to body size categories over time and across strata of sex and age, varying definitions of metabolic health. Methods We analysed data from national health interview and examination surveys 1997–99 and 2008–11 for adults aged 18–79 years (GNHIES98: N = 6,565; DEGS1: 6,860). Metabolic health as defined by ATPIII criteria was examined across body mass index categories. The Plourde and Karelis criteria were applied in relation to abdominal obesity. Results Proportions of adults with metabolic health by body size categories were largely stable over time, except for an increasing proportion of metabolically healthy persons with pre-obesity and metabolically healthy women without abdominal obesity. In both surveys proportions of adults meeting ATPIII criteria ranged from approximately 30% among men and women with obesity, to about two thirds of those with pre-obesity to about 93% among those with normal weight. According to Plourde and Karelis criteria proportions ranged from almost 30% among men and women without abdominal obesity to less than 10% among those with abdominal obesity. Proportions were consistently higher among younger than older age groups and less consistently higher among women than men. Conclusions Proportions of adults with metabolic health by body size categories were largely stable over time, except for an increasing proportion of metabolically healthy women without abdominal obesity. There is no evidence that metabolic health among adults with obesity increased in Germany over a period of ten years."
https://openalex.org/W2557056650,"The Falkland Islands are predicted to experience up to 2.2°C rise in mean annual temperature over the coming century, greater than four times the rate over the last century. Our study investigates likely vulnerabilities of a suite of range-restricted species whose distributions are associated with archipelago-wide climatic variation. We used present day climate maps calibrated using local weather data, 2020-2080 climate predictions from regional climate models, non-climate variables derived from a digital terrain model and a comprehensive database on local plant distributions. Weighted mean ensemble models were produced to assess changes in range sizes and overlaps between the current range and protected areas network. Target species included three globally threatened Falkland endemics, Nassauvia falklandica, Nastanthus falklandicus and Plantago moorei; and two nationally threatened species, Acaena antarctica and Blechnum cordatum. Our research demonstrates that temperature increases predicted for the next century have the potential to significantly alter plant distributions across the Falklands. Upland species, in particular, were found to be highly vulnerable to climate change impacts. No known locations of target upland species or the southwestern species Plantago moorei are predicted to remain environmentally suitable in the face of predicted climate change. We identify potential refugia for these species and associated gaps in the current protected areas network. Species currently restricted to the milder western parts of the archipelago are broadly predicted to expand their ranges under warmer temperatures. Our results emphasise the importance of implementing suitable adaptation strategies to offset climate change impacts, particularly site management. There is an urgent need for long-term monitoring and artificial warming experiments; the results of this study will inform the selection of the most suitable locations for these. Results are also helping inform management recommendations for the Falkland Islands Government who seek to better conserve their biodiversity and meet commitments to multi-lateral environmental agreements."
https://openalex.org/W2549390774,"A present challenge in fire ecology is to optimize management techniques so that ecological services are maximized and C emissions minimized. Here, we modeled the effects of different prescribed-burning rotation intervals and wildfires on carbon emissions (present and future) in British moorlands. Biomass-accumulation curves from four Calluna-dominated ecosystems along a north-south gradient in Great Britain were calculated and used within a matrix-model based on Markov Chains to calculate above-ground biomass-loads and annual C emissions under different prescribed-burning rotation intervals. Additionally, we assessed the interaction of these parameters with a decreasing wildfire return intervals. We observed that litter accumulation patterns varied between sites. Northern sites (colder and wetter) accumulated lower amounts of litter with time than southern sites (hotter and drier). The accumulation patterns of the living vegetation dominated by Calluna were determined by site-specific conditions. The optimal prescribed-burning rotation interval for minimizing annual carbon emissions also differed between sites: the optimal rotation interval for northern sites was between 30 and 50 years, whereas for southern sites a hump-backed relationship was found with the optimal interval either between 8 to 10 years or between 30 to 50 years. Increasing wildfire frequency interacted with prescribed-burning rotation intervals by both increasing C emissions and modifying the optimum prescribed-burning interval for minimum C emission. This highlights the importance of studying site-specific biomass accumulation patterns with respect to environmental conditions for identifying suitable fire-rotation intervals to minimize C emissions."
https://openalex.org/W2551967723,"Background Paradoxical sleep deprivation activates the sympathetic nervous system and the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis, subsequently interfering with the cardiovascular system. The beneficial effects of resistance training are related to hemodynamic, metabolic and hormonal homeostasis. We hypothesized that resistance training can prevent the cardiac remodeling and dysfunction caused by paradoxical sleep deprivation. Methods Male Wistar rats were distributed into four groups: control (C), resistance training (RT), paradoxical sleep deprivation for 96 hours (PSD96) and both resistance training and sleep deprivation (RT/PSD96). Doppler echocardiograms, hemodynamics measurements, cardiac histomorphometry, hormonal profile and molecular analysis were evaluated. Results Compared to the C group, PSD96 group had a higher left ventricular systolic pressure, heart rate and left atrium index. In contrast, the left ventricle systolic area and the left ventricle cavity diameter were reduced in the PSD96 group. Hypertrophy and fibrosis were also observed. Along with these alterations, reduced levels of serum testosterone and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), as well as increased corticosterone and angiotensin II, were observed in the PSD96 group. Prophylactic resistance training attenuated most of these changes, except angiotensin II, fibrosis, heart rate and concentric remodeling of left ventricle, confirmed by the increased of NFATc3 and GATA-4, proteins involved in the pathologic cardiac hypertrophy pathway. Conclusions Resistance training effectively attenuates cardiac dysfunction and hormonal imbalance induced by paradoxical sleep deprivation."
https://openalex.org/W2555998438,"To evaluate the relation of central sleep apnoea (CSA) to the severity and short-term prognosis of patients who experience acute coronary syndrome (ACS).Observational study with cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses. Patients acutely admitted to participating hospitals because of ACS underwent respiratory polygraphy during the first 24 to 72 h. CSA was defined as an apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI) >15 events•h-1 (>50% of central apnoeas). ACS severity (Killip class, ejection fraction, number of diseased vessels and peak plasma troponin) was evaluated at baseline, and short-term prognosis (length of hospitalization, complications and mortality) was evaluated at discharge.A total of 68 CSA patients (AHI 31±18 events•h-1, 64±12 years, 87% males) and 92 controls (AHI 7±5 events•h-1, 62±12 years, 84% males) were included in the analyses. After adjusting for age, body mass index, hypertension and smoking status, patients diagnosed with CSA spent more days in the coronary unit compared with controls (3.7±2.9 vs. 1.5±1.7; p<0.001) and had a worse Killip class (Killip I: 16% vs. 96%; p<0.001). No differences were observed in ejection fraction estimates.CSA patients exhibited increased ACS severity as indicated by their Killip classification. These patients had a worse prognosis, with longer lengths of stay in the coronary care units. Our results highlight the relevance of CSA in patients suffering ACS episodes and suggest that diagnosing CSA may be a useful strategy to improve the management of certain ACS patients."
https://openalex.org/W2556160938,"In geographic atrophy (GA), choroidal vessels typically appear on structural optical coherence tomography (OCT) as hyperreflective round areas with highly reflective borders. We observed that some GA eyes show choroidal round hyporeflectivities with highly reflective borders beneath the atrophy, and futher investigated the charcteristcs by comparing structural OCT, indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) and OCT angiography (OCT-A).Round hyporeflectivities were individuated from a pool of patients with GA secondary to non-neovascular age-related macular degeneration consecutively presenting between October 2015 and March 2016 at the Medical Retina & Imaging Unit of the University Vita-Salute San Raffaele. Patients underwent a complete ophthalmologic examination including ICGA, structural OCT and OCT-A. The correspondence between choroidal round hyporeflectivities beneath GA on structural OCT and ICGA and OCT-A imaging were analyzed.Fifty eyes of 26 consecutive patients (17 females and 9 males; mean age 76.8±6.2 years) with GA were included. Twenty-nine round hyporeflectivities have been found by OCT in choroidal layers in 21 eyes of 21 patients (42.0%; estimated prevalence of 57.7%). All 29 round hyporeflectivities showed constantly a hyperreflective border and a backscattering on structural OCT, and appeared as hypofluorescent in late phase ICGA and as dark foci with non detectable flow in the choroidal segmentation of OCT-A. Interestingly, the GA area was greater in eyes with compared to eyes without round hyporeflectivities (9.30±5.74 and 5.57±4.48mm2, respectively; p = 0.01).Our results suggest that most round hyporeflectivities beneath GA may represent non-perfused or hypo-perfused choroidal vessels with non-detectable flow."
https://openalex.org/W2549348238,"The Stop Signal Task (SST), a commonly used measure of response inhibition, uses standard psychophysical methods to gain an estimate of the time needed to withhold a prepotent response. Under some circumstances, conventional forms of the SST are impractical to use because of the large number of trials necessary to gain a reliable estimate of the speed of inhibition. Here we applied to the SST an adaptive method for estimating psychometric parameters that can find reliable threshold estimates over a relatively small number of trials. The Ψ adaptive staircase, which uses a Bayesian algorithm to find the most likely parameters of a psychophysical function, was used to estimate the critical stop signal delay at which the probability of successful response inhibition equals 0.5. Using computational modeling and adult participants, estimates of stop signal reaction time (SSRT) based on the Ψ staircase were compared to estimates using the method of constant stimuli and a standard staircase method of adjustment. Results demonstrate that a reliable estimate of SSRT can be gained very quickly (20–30 stop trials), making the method very useful for testing populations that cannot maintain concentration for long periods or for rapidly obtaining multiple SSRT estimates from healthy adult participants."

Pulsations can easily be concealed due to the small movements of the aneurysm wall, making post-processing highly demanding. We hypothesized that the quantification of aneurysm pulsation is technically feasible and can be improved by computer-aided post-processing.Images of 14 cerebral aneurysms were acquired with an ECG-triggered 4D CTA. Aneurysms were post-processed manually and computer-aided on a 3D model. Volume curves and random noise-curves were compared with the arterial pulse wave and volume curves were compared between both post-processing modalities.The aneurysm volume curves showed higher similarity with the pulse wave than the random curves (Hausdorff-distances 0.12 vs 0.25, p<0.01). Both post-processing methods did not differ in intra- (r = 0.45 vs r = 0.54, p>0.05) and inter-observer (r = 0.45 vs r = 0.54, p>0.05) reliability. Time needed for segmentation was significantly reduced in the computer-aided group (3.9 ± 1.8 min vs 20.8 ± 7.8 min, p<0.01).Our results show pulsatile changes in a subset of the studied aneurysms with the final prove of underlying volume changes remaining unsettled. Semi-automatic post-processing significantly reduces post-processing time but cannot yet replace manual segmentation."
https://openalex.org/W2553578184,"Volvox sect. Volvox is characterized by having unique morphological characteristics, such as thick cytoplasmic bridges between adult somatic cells in the spheroids and spiny zygote walls. Species of this section are found from various freshwater habitats. Recently, three species of Volvox sect. Volvox originating from rice paddies and a marsh were studied taxonomically based on molecular and morphological data of cultured materials. However, taxonomic studies have not been performed on cultured materials of this section originating from large lake water bodies. We studied a new morphological type of Volvox sect. Volvox (""Volvox sp. Sagami""), using cultured materials originating from two large lakes and a pond in Japan. Volvox sp. Sagami produced monoecious sexual spheroids and may represent a new morphological species; it could be clearly distinguished from all previously described monoecious species of Volvox sect. Volvox by its small number of eggs or zygotes (5-25) in sexual spheroids, with short acute spines (up to 3 μm long) on the zygote walls and elongated anterior somatic cells in asexual spheroids. Based on sequences of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of nuclear ribosomal DNA (rDNA; ITS-1, 5.8S rDNA and ITS-2) and plastid genes, however, the Volvox sp. Sagami lineage and its sister lineage (the monoecious species V. ferrisii) showed very small genetic differences, which correspond to the variation within a single biological species in other volvocalean algae. Since V. ferrisii was different from Volvox sp. Sagami, by having approximately 100-200 zygotes in the sexual spheroids and long spines (6-8.5 μm long) on the zygote walls, as well as growing in Japanese rice paddies, these two morphologically distinct lineages might have diverged rapidly in the two different freshwater habitats. In addition, the swimming velocity during phototaxis of Volvox sp. Sagami spheroids originating from large lakes was significantly higher than that of V. ferrisii originating from rice paddies, suggesting adaptation of Volvox sp. Sagami to large water bodies."
https://openalex.org/W2555313882,"In many social systems, groups of individuals can find remarkably efficient solutions to complex cognitive problems, sometimes even outperforming a single expert. The success of the group, however, crucially depends on how the judgments of the group members are aggregated to produce the collective answer. A large variety of such aggregation methods have been described in the literature, such as averaging the independent judgments, relying on the majority or setting up a group discussion. In the present work, we introduce a novel approach for aggregating judgments-the transmission chain-which has not yet been consistently evaluated in the context of collective intelligence. In a transmission chain, all group members have access to a unique collective solution and can improve it sequentially. Over repeated improvements, the collective solution that emerges reflects the judgments of every group members. We address the question of whether such a transmission chain can foster collective intelligence for binary-choice problems. In a series of numerical simulations, we explore the impact of various factors on the performance of the transmission chain, such as the group size, the model parameters, and the structure of the population. The performance of this method is compared to those of the majority rule and the confidence-weighted majority. Finally, we rely on two existing datasets of individuals performing a series of binary decisions to evaluate the expected performances of the three methods empirically. We find that the parameter space where the transmission chain has the best performance rarely appears in real datasets. We conclude that the transmission chain is best suited for other types of problems, such as those that have cumulative properties."
https://openalex.org/W2550900682,"Musical rhythms encompass temporal patterns that often yield regular metrical accents (e.g., a beat). There have been mixed results regarding perception as a function of metrical saliency, namely, whether sensitivity to a deviant was greater in metrically stronger or weaker positions. Besides, effects of metrical position have not been examined in non-isochronous rhythms, or with respect to multisensory influences. This study was concerned with two main issues: (1) In non-isochronous auditory rhythms with clear metrical accents, how would sensitivity to a deviant be modulated by metrical positions? (2) Would the effects be enhanced by multisensory information? Participants listened to strongly metrical rhythms with or without watching a point-light figure dance to the rhythm in the same meter, and detected a slight loudness increment. Both conditions were presented with or without an auditory interference that served to impair auditory metrical perception. Sensitivity to a deviant was found greater in weak beat than in strong beat positions, consistent with the Predictive Coding hypothesis and the idea of metrically induced illusory phenomenal accents. The visual rhythm of dance hindered auditory detection, but more so when the latter was itself less impaired. This pattern suggested that the visual and auditory rhythms were perceptually integrated to reinforce metrical accentuation, yielding more illusory phenomenal accents and thus lower sensitivity to deviants, in a manner consistent with the principle of inverse effectiveness. Results were discussed in the predictive framework for multisensory rhythms involving observed movements and possible mediation of the motor system."
https://openalex.org/W2554626026,"Salmonella enterica can actively invade the gastro-intestinal epithelium. This frequently leads to diarrheal disease, and also gives the pathogen access to phagocytes that can serve as vehicles for dissemination into deeper tissue. The ability to invade host cells is also important in maintaining the carrier state. While much is known about the bacterial factors that promote invasion, relatively little is known about the host factors involved. To gain insight into how Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is able to invade normally non-phagocytic cells, we undertook a global RNAi screen with S. Typhimurium-infected human epithelial cells. In all, we identified 633 genes as contributing to bacterial internalization. These genes fall into a diverse group of functional categories revealing that cytoskeletal regulators are not the only factors that modulate invasion. In fact, potassium ion transport was the most enriched molecular function category in our screen, reinforcing a link between potassium and internalization. In addition to providing new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the ability of pathogens to invade host cells, all 633 host factors identified are candidates for new anti-microbial targets for treating Salmonella infections, and may be useful in curtailing infections with other pathogens as well."
https://openalex.org/W2551964450,"The increased paternal age at conception (PAC) has been associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), schizophrenia and other neurodevelopmental disorders, thus raising questions that imply, potential health concerns in the offspring. As opposed to female oogonia, the male germ cells undergo hundreds of cell divisions during the fertile years. Thus, the advanced paternal age is associated with increase of point mutations in the male spermatogonia DNA, implying that this could be the major driving mechanism behind the paternal age effect observed in the offspring. In addition to replication errors, DNA replication fidelity and inefficient DNA repair machinery in the spermatogonia also contribute to the mutagenic load. Our study population consisted of 38 nonagenarians, participants in the Vitality 90+ Study, born in the year 1920 (women n = 25, men n = 13), for whom the parental birth dates were available. The gene expression profile of the study subjects was determined with HumanHT-12 v4 Expression BeadChip from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We used Spearman's rank correlation to look for the associations of gene expression with paternal age at conception. Associated transcripts were further analyzed with GOrilla and IPA to determine enriched cellular processes and pathways. PAC was associated with the expression levels of 648 transcripts in nonagenarian subjects. These transcripts belonged to the process of mitochondrial translational termination and the canonical pathway of Mitochondrial dysfunction, more specifically of Oxidative phosphorylation. The observed systematic down-regulation of several mitochondrial respiratory chain components implies compromised function in oxidative phosphorylation and thus in the production of chemical energy."

The assessment of mortality risk upon post-interventional ICU admission is important to optimizing clinical management. This study sought to determine outcomes and factors affecting mortality in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), and to analyze and compare the predictive values of SAPS II and EuroSCORE.214 consecutive patients treated with transfemoral TAVI (2006-2012) admitted to the ICU in an academic tertiary-care university hospital, were included in this retrospective data analysis. The overall 30-day mortality rate was 7%. Non-survivors at 30-days and survivors showed differences in the rates of catecholamine therapy upon ICU admission (93 vs. 29%; p<0.001), stroke (20 vs. 1%;p<0.001), sepsis (27 vs. 2%;p<0.001), kidney injury (83 vs. 56%; log-rank p<0.001), catecholamine therapy (88 vs. 61%;log-rank p<0.001) and vascular complications (60 vs. 17%; p<0.001). Mean SAPS II score and predicted mortality were higher in non-survivors (38.1±7.0 vs. 29.9±6.2;p<0.001 and 23.1±11.7 vs. 10.5±8.2;p<0.001, retrospectively), whereas the logistic EuroSCORE could not discriminate between the groups (p = 0.555). Among the biochemical parameters, the maximum values of creatinine, procalcitonin, and troponin I during the first 48 h after ICU admission were significantly higher in non-survivors. Multivariate analysis of baseline characteristics and complications associated with two-year mortality showed no significant results.The SAPS II is a good tool for estimating ICU mortality immediately after performing the TAVI procedure and provides valuable information for other known predictors of mortality."
https://openalex.org/W2554084852,"In humans, the amount of spinal homonymous recurrent inhibition during voluntary contraction is usually assessed by using a peripheral nerve stimulation paradigm. This method consists of conditioning the maximal M-wave (SM stimulus) with prior reflex stimulation (S1), with 10 ms inter-stimulus interval (ISI). The decrease observed between unconditioned (S1 only) and conditioned (S1+SM) reflex size is then attributed to recurrent inhibition. However, during a voluntary contraction, a superimposed SM stimulation leads to a maximal M-wave followed by a voluntary (V) wave at similar latency than the H-reflex. This wave can therefore interfere with the conditioned H-reflex when two different stimulation intensities are used (S1 and SM), leading to misinterpretation of the data. The aim of the present study was to assess if conditioning V-wave response instead of H-reflex, by applying SM for both stimuli (test and conditioning), can be used as an index of recurrent inhibition. Conditioned and unconditioned responses of soleus and medial gastrocnemius muscles were recorded in twelve subjects at 25% and at 50% of maximal voluntary contraction at the usual ISI of 10 ms and an optimal inter-stimulus of 15 ms determined upon M- and V-wave latencies. Conditioned H-reflex (obtained with S1+SM paradigm) was significantly lower than the unconditioned by ~30% on average, meaning that the amount of inhibition was 70%. This amount of recurrent inhibition was significantly lower at higher force level with both methods. Regardless of the level of force or the conditioning ISI, results obtained with V-wave conditioning (SM+SM) were similar at both force levels, linearly correlated and proportional to those obtained with H conditioning. Then, V-wave conditioning appears to be a reliable index of homonymous recurrent inhibition during voluntary contraction."

Study 1 showed that residentially stable cities that employed more journalists—who can be regarded as social monitoring agents in a community—tended to have lower rates of violent crime than residentially stable cities that employed fewer journalists; by contrast, in residentially mobile cities, violent crime rates did not vary as a function of the number of journalists employed. In Study 2, we found that individual differences in perceptions of relational mobility moderated the effects of social monitoring on cheating in a die-under-cup game. Specifically, social monitoring cues reduced the likelihood of cheating but only among participants who perceived their immediate social environment to be low in relational mobility. The same results were replicated in Study 3, an experiment in which participants’ perception of relational mobility was manipulated before completing an online maze game that allowed them to earn extra cash. In the low mobility condition, the percentage of participants who continued working on the mazes after reaching the time limit decreased as a function of social monitoring; however, this pattern was not observed in the high mobility condition. Together, our findings suggest that socioecological context matters for understanding effective mechanisms of social control."

In order to test this hypothesis, we construct a cerebral blood flow (CBF) estimator based on transcranial Doppler (TCD) blood flow velocity and ten other easily available patient characteristics and clinical parameters. A total of 261 measurements were collected from 88 older patients. The estimator is based on local regression (Random Forest). Its performance is analyzed against baseline CBF from 3-D pseudocontinuous arterial spin labeling (pCASL) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Patient specific CBF predictions are of poor quality (r = 0.41 and p-value = 4.5 × 10-12); the hypothesis is thus not clearly supported by evidence."
https://openalex.org/W2555471126,"Hepatitis C virus is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus. The gene junction partitioning the viral glycoproteins E1 and E2 displays concurrent sequence evolution with the 3'-end of E1 highly conserved and the 5'-end of E2 highly heterogeneous. This gene junction is also believed to contain structured RNA elements, with a growing body of evidence suggesting that such structures can act as an additional level of viral replication and transcriptional control. We have previously used ultradeep pyrosequencing to analyze an amplicon library spanning the E1/E2 gene junction from a treatment naïve patient where samples were collected over 10 years of chronic HCV infection. During this timeframe maintenance of an in-frame insertion, recombination and humoral immune targeting of discrete virus sub-populations was reported. In the current study, we present evidence of epistatic evolution across the E1/E2 gene junction and observe the development of co-varying networks of codons set against a background of a complex virome with periodic shifts in population dominance. Overtime, the number of codons actively mutating decreases for all virus groupings. We identify strong synonymous co-variation between codon sites in a group of sequences harbouring a 3 bp in-frame insertion and propose that synonymous mutation acts to stabilize the RNA structural backbone."
