https://openalex.org/W2027411626,"Abstract We have stably transformed mammalian cells with precisely defined procaryotic and eucaryotic genes for which no selective criteria exist. The addition of a purified viral thymidine kinase (tk) gene to mouse cells lacking this enzyme results in the appearance of stable transformants which can be selected by their ability to grow in HAT. These biochemical transformants may represent a subpopulation of competent cells which are likely to integrate other unlinked genes at frequencies higher than the general population. Co-transformation experiments were therefore performed with the viral tk gene and bacteriophage ΦX174, plasmid pBR322 or the cloned chromosomal rabbit β-globin gene sequences. Tk + transformants were cloned and analyzed for co-transfer of additional DNA sequences by blot hybridization. In this manner, we have identified mouse cell lines which contain multiple copies of 4)X, pBR322 and the rabbit β-globin gene sequences. The ΦX co-transformants were studied in greatest detail. The frequency of co-transformation is high: 15 of 16 tk + transformants contain the ΦX sequences. Selective pressure was required to identify co-transformants. From one to more than fifty ΦX sequences are integrated into high molecular weight nuclear DNA isolated from independent clones. Analysis of subclones demonstrates that the ΦX genotype is stable through many generations in culture. This co-transformation system should allow the introduction and stable integration of virtually any defined gene into cultured cells. Ligation to either viral vectors or selectable biochemical markers is not required."

We refer to this transmembranous association as the fibronexus. Hamster embryo fibroblasts, transformed by wild-type or temperature-sensitive mutant (A28) SV40 virus, and human lung fibroblasts (WI-38, MRC-5) were studied using the tannic acid method of Simionescu and Simionescu, 1976 Simionescu N. Simionescu M. Galloylglucoses of low molecular weight as mordant in electron microscopy. I. Procedure, and evidence for mordanting effect. J. Cell Biol. 1976; 70: 608-621 Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar , which preferentially stained external carbohydrates. Fibronectin antigens were also localized on the extracellular fibers of the fibronexus with fibronectin antibody and immunoferritin staining. Goniometric studies of sections cut parallel to the plasmalemma demonstrated that the actin- and fibronectin-containing fibers of the fibronexus remained colinear when the specimen was tilted through a 40° angle about the fibrillar long axis. Sections cut perpendicular to the cell surface also showed that these fibers were apparently colinear. Our results suggest that the fibronectin and actin fibers of the fibronexus are closely associated (maximum separation distances of 8–22 nm), if not co-axial. Fibronexuses remained after expression of SV40-induced transformation, despite alteration of microfilament bundles and reduction in the amount of fibronectin (observed by immunofluorescence microscopy). The possible roles of fibronectin and the fibronexus in regulating actin polymerization and discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1994624978,"Specific binding of tritiated oxytocin to uterine receptors of pregnant rats increases dramatically at term and is maximal during labor. In mammary glands the increase in binding is gradual, reaching a maximum during the lactation period. Concomitant changes in the sensitivity of the uterus and mammary gland to oxytocin indicate that the receptor concentration is of functional significance. Oxytocin receptors, therefore, may regulate the response of the target organs to circulating oxytocin and thereby control the onset of labor and lactation. Ovarian steroids participate in the regulation of oxytocin receptors in a manner as yet unclarified."
https://openalex.org/W2027816421,"Abstract The complete sequence of the iso-1-cytochrome c gene of yeast has been determined. The coding region of the gene contains no intervening sequences. The coding strand of the DNA immediately upstream from the coding region contains many fewer G residues than the rest of the coding strand both within and beyond the carboxy terminus of the coding region. One consequence of the reduced number of G residues in this region is the absence of the sequence ATG for 122 nucleotides upstream from the initiating ATG. Together with previous studies on the mRNA and the genetics of yeast iso-1-Cytochrome c, the sequence supports a model in which translation starts at the first AUG down-stream from the 5′ terminus of the mRNA, with no other sequence requirements. It also is evident that iso-1-cytochrome c is synthesized directly and not through an intermediary, longer precursor protein, as is often the case for proteins that interact with membranes. The DNA upstream and downstream from the coding region contains sequences which are potential transcription start and stop signals. The sequence confirms the assignments of non-sense and missense mutations throughout the coding region of the gene and provides a rationale for some mutational characteristics of the gene. Part of the sequence was determined using two new strategies for the Sanger terminator method, both of which obviate the need for restriction fragment isolation and template strand separation."

https://openalex.org/W2048374199,"Examination of DNA fragments produced from either formaldehyde-fixed or unfixed SV40 minichromosomes by multiple-cut restriction endonucleases has led to the following major results: Exhaustive digestion of unfixed minichromosomes with Hae III generated all ten major limit-digest DNA fragments as well as partial cleavage products. In striking contrast to this result, Hae III acted on formaldehyde-fixed minichromosomes to yield only one of the limit-digest fragments, F, which is located in the immediate vicinity of the origin of replication, spanning nucleotides 5169 and 250 on the DNA sequence map of Reddy et al., 1978 Reddy V.B. Thimmappaya B. Dhar R. Subramanian K.N. Zain S. Pan J. Ghosh P.K. Celma M.L. Weissman S.M. The genome of simian virus 40. Science. 1978; 200: 494-502 Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar . This 300 base pair (bp) fragment was released as naked DNA from formaldehyde-fixed, Hae III-digested minichromosomes following treatment either by pronase-SDS or by SDS alone. In the latter case, the remainder of the minichromosome retained its compact configuration as assayed by both sedimentational and electrophoretic methods. In minichromosomes, the F fragment is therefore not only accessible to Hae III at its ends, but is also neither formaldehyde crosslinked into any SDS-resistant nucleoprotein structure nor topologically “locked” within the compact minichromosomal particle. This same fragment was preferentially produced during the early stages of digestion of unfixed minichromosomes with Hae III, and its final yield in the exhaustive Hae III digest was significantly higher than that of other limit-digest fragments. Similar results were obtained upon digestion of either unfixed or formaldehyde-fixed minichromosomes with Alu I. In particular, of approximately twenty major limit-digest DNA fragments, only two fragments (F and P, encompassing nucleotides 5146 to 190, and 190 to 325, respectively) were produced by Alu I from the formaldehyde-fixed minichromosomes. All other restriction endonucleases tested (Mbo I, Mbo II, Hind III, Hin II+III and Hinf I), for which there are no closely spaced recognition sequences in the above mentioned regions of the SV40 genome, did not produce any significant amount of limit-digest DNA fragments from formaldehyde-fixed minichromosomes. These findings, taken together with our earlier data on the preferential exposure of the origin of replication in SV40 minichromosomes ( Varshavsky et al., 1978 Varshavsky A.J. Sundin O.H. Bohn M.J. SV40 viral minichromosome: preferential exposure of the origin of replication as probed by restriction endonucleases. Nucl. Acids Res. 1978; 5: 3469-3478 Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar ), strongly suggest that a specific region of the “late” SV40 DNA approximately 400 bp long is uniquely exposed in the compact minichromosome. It is of interest that, in addition to the origin of replication, this region contains binding sites for T antigen ( Tjian, 1977 Tjian R. The binding site on SV40 DNA for a T antigen-related protein. Cell. 1977; 13: 165-179 Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (230) Google Scholar ), specific tandem repeated sequences and apparently also the promoters for synthesis of late SV40 mRNAs ( Fiers et al., 1978 Fiers W.

https://openalex.org/W2086252935,"The majority of cell lines derived by infection of murine bone marrow cells with Abelson murine leukemia virus (A-MuLV) synthesize a mu chain but no detectable light chain. Aside from this mu-only phenotype, lines that make only light chain, both chains or no immunoglobulin-related polypeptides have also been found. Two lines have been studied in detail: one that makes only mu chain and one that makes only kappa light chain. Synthesis of both polypeptides can be increased by modifying the culture conditions so as to decrease the growth rate of the cells. Although some kappa chain secretion was observed, neither secreted nor surface mu was detected. We suggest that the mu- only phenotype may be an early normal step in the pathway of B lymphocyte maturation."
https://openalex.org/W2048761879,"The cytoskeletal framework prepared by detergent lysis of suspension-grown HeLa cells is compared to the structure obtained from poliovirus-infected cells. This framework, which retains major features of cell morphology and carries the cellular polyribosomes as well as the major structural filaments, is profoundly reorganized following virus infection. This reorganization underlies, at least in part, the morphological changes termed the ""cytoplasmic effect."" These cytoskeletal changes appear related to the involvement of the framework with viral-specific metabolism. Extensive cytoskeleton alterations occur even when guanidine inhibits viral replication, and thus result from small amounts of early viral products. The normally spheroidal nucleus deforms, allowing a modified region of the cytoplasm to occupy a central position in the cell, and many membrane-enclosed vesicles peculiar to the infected cell are elaborated here. The skeleton preparation reveals that this region contains intermediate filaments arranged in a pattern unique to infected cells. Further changes occur when viral replication is permitted. The central region filaments become coated with darkly staining material which may be viral RNA. Numerous small particles appear on the filaments which resemble partially assembled virions. Mature virions, however, have no affinity for the cytoskeleton and appear to be free in the cytoplasm. Host cell messenger RNA, normally attached to the skeletal framework, is released in infected cells and is replaced by the viral-specific polyribosomes. The trabecular network which carries polyribosomes appears to be rearranged; the viral polyribosomes are located principally at the cell periphery and are excluded from the central region. The viral replication complex with its double-stranded RNA is also attached to the skeletal framework and may comprise the dark staining material coating the filaments of the central cell region."

https://openalex.org/W2082630050,"We have used restriction endonucleases which cleave the DNA of mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) at one site (Eco RI) and several sites (Pst I, Sac I and Bam HI) to study infection and mammary tumorigenesis in mice. Proviruses acquired during infection of BALB/c mice foster-nursed by virus-producing C3H females can be distinguished from the MMTV proviruses endogenous to uninfected BALB/c mice by the nature of the fragments generated with Pst I and Bam HI. Using this assay, we show that lactating mammary glands as well as mammary tumors from BALB/cfC3H mice have acquired MMTV DNA, and that a minimum of approximately 10% of normal glandular cells can be infected. The new proviruses appear to be linked to cellular DNA of mammary tumors and infected lactating mammary glands within a limited region (0.2 x 10(6) daltons) of the viral DNA; the location of this region, based upon mapping studies with unintegrated MMTV DNA, suggests that the orientation of these proviruses is colinear with linear DNA synthesized in infected cells and thus approximately colinear with the viral RNA. Comparisons of many mammary tumors and studies of lactating mammary glands with a high proportion of independently infected cells indicate that a large number of sites in the cellular genome can accommodate a new provirus; the acquired proviruses are rarely, if ever, found in tandem with each other or with endogenous proviruses. We cannot, however, distinguish between random integration and integration into a large number of preferred sites in the host genome. Since Eco RI and Bam HI cleavage of DNA from each mammary tumor generates a unique set of viral-specific fragments, we propose that the tumors are composed principally of cells derived from a subset of the many infected cells in a mammary gland; this proposal is supported by our finding that Eco RI digestion of DNA from several transplants of a primary tumor yields the pattern characteristic of the primary tumor."

Intracerebral administration of some of these hormones or fragments thereof elicit behavioral responses, suggesting that they may have a physiological role similar to that described for other peptidergic neurotransmitter or neuromodulator substances. Evidence available for some of these hormones indicates that they are synthesized within the central nervous system and that their regulation may differ from that of their pituitary counterparts."
https://openalex.org/W2094189881,"The effect of phospholipid methylation on the number of beta-adrenergic receptor binding sites was examined in rat reticulocyte membranes. Stimulation of phosphatidylcholine synthesis by the introduction of the methyl donor S-adenosyl-L-methionine into reticulocyte ghosts increased the number of beta-adrenergic receptor sites. The appearance of beta-adrenergic binding sites was dependent on the formation of phosphatidylcholine by the enzyme that converts phosphatidyl-N-monomethylethanolamine from phosphatidylethanolamine. Both the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine and the unmasking of cryptic receptors were time and temperature dependent and did not occur in the presence of the methyl transferase inhibitor, S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine."

https://openalex.org/W2028260410,"Persistent infection of BHK21 cells was established with cloned vesicular stomatitis virus plus purified DI particles and maintained in vitro for over 5 years. After 1 year of persistence, the infectious virus RNA genome had evolved several oligonucleotide map changes, and numerous changes had accumulated by 3.5 years. Additional evolution occurred by the fourth year and continued until the fifth year. The contrast, repeated passage of virus in acute infections of several cell types in vitro or in vivo did not lead to detectable oligonucleotide map changes. The short DI particle originally used to co-infect with infectious virus in establishing persistent infection has been displaced by an ever present and constantly changing population of other DI particles of differing sizes and radically differing oligonucleotide maps. We conclude that the genomes of both infectious VSV and its DI particles undergo continuous evolutionary change during years of persistence. In the infectious virus, these changes involve hundreds of mutations which are usually expressed as poorly replicating, temperature-sensitive, small plaque mutants. These are stable mutants which do not revert to wild-type when passaged repeatedly in acute infections at 37 or 33°C. It appears that the sequestered intracellular environment of persistently infected cells favors rapid and continuous virus evolution."

https://openalex.org/W2016840957,"Nuclear and cytoplasmic polyoma virus-specific RNA extracted from 32P-labeled mouse embryo cells late during productive viral infection was analyzed for the presence of 5' terminal capped structures by complete digestion with RNAases T1, T2 and A, followed by two-dimensional electrophoretic fractionation. Seven major cap I structures (m7 GpppNm1pN2p) were observed in both cases. These termini were further characterized by digestion with penicillium nuclease P1, followed by product analysis in a variety of alternative separate systems. Each structure had an individual combination of N1 and N2 nucleotides, where N1 was always a purine nucleotide but N2 was any nucleotide subject to the single exception that m7GpppGmpCp is found only in low yield. Four different cap II derivatives (m7GpppNm1pNm2pN3p) of four of the cap I structures were also detected in cytoplasmic RNA. None of the termini described derived from contaminating host cell RNA. All of these cap structures mapped on the polyoma viral DNA genome between 66 and 71 map units, a region distant from the 5' end of the bodies of two of the three late polyoma mRNAs. All the polyoma virus-specific cap structures, however, were present in each of the purified 16S, 18S and 19s late mRNAs. These data suggested that families of capped leader sequences of varying sizes are attached to the main body of each late polyoma mRNA species by a splicing mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1989842486,"Abstract We have used DNA transfection to study the endogenous retrovirus genomes inherited by uninfected mouse cells. Quantitative assays for infectious DNAs of ecotropic and xenotropic murine leukemia viruses (MuLVs) were developed using donor DNAs of cells that were exogenously infected with ecotropic Moloney, AKR or BALB MuLVs, or with xenotropic AKR, BALB or NZB MuLVs. The DNAs of cells exogenously infected with ecotropic MuLVs had specific infectivities of approximately 0.5 infectious units (IU) per μg DNA in transfection assays on NIH/3T3 cells. The DNAs of cells exogenously infected with xenotropic MuLVs had specific infectivities of approximately 0.2 IU/μg DNA in transfection assays on mink CCL64 cells. In contrast, the DNAs of uninfected NIH/3T3, BALB/3T3 and AKR-2B mouse cells were noninfectious when assayed for infectious endogenous ecotropic MuLV DNAs ("

Under these conditions, it was found that very few cells served as target cells for these three viruses. Density gradient separation showed that ALV target cells were found primarily in the light density fractions and might be represented by cells committed to the mononuclear phagocyte pathway. Separation of bone marrow cells on the basis of their sedimentation velocity at unit gravity suggested that MC29 and AMV did not share the same target cells. In addition, the analysis of surface receptors and functional markers characteristic of macrophages (Fc and complement receptors, phagocytosis and immune phagocytosis) indicated that the ALV-transformed cells were blocked during their differentiation. These results indicate that the transforming ability of ALV interferes with the differentiation of their target cells."

https://openalex.org/W1983525206,"Ribonuclease T1 fingerprints of the three ""late"" polyoma virus mRNAs show that oligonucleotides of the leader sequence are present in multiple copies in each mRNA. These oligonucleotides, however, appear unimolar in fingerprints of complete, continuous transcripts of the late strand of the viral DNA. Oligonucleotides which are represented only once in the DNA are thus reiterated in the mature mRNAs. Consequently, when mRNA was hybridized to the leader region of immobilized viral DNA, those copies present in excess of their genomic representation failed to hybridize and were released by RNAase treatment. Analysis of the RNAase-resistant hybrids revealed a series of leader species with complex sequence arrangements. We suggest that these complicated reiterated sequences are generated during the processing of a precursor RNA which extends several times around the genome. This RNA would be shortened by a series of splicing reactions which conserve sequences from the leader region and attach them to a suitable coding sequence."

The defeated mice were tested for submissiveness at either 24 hours, 48 hours, or 7 days after the initial encounter. Both hormone treatments increased future submissiveness, although the time courses of the effects were different: The effects of ACTH disappeared after 48 hours, whereas those of vasopressin persisted for 7 days. These results suggest that changes in peptide hormone levels following naturally stressful experiences can affect the memory of those experiences, as expressed in future adaptive responses."
https://openalex.org/W2033541146,"Analysis of the viral RNA in four Burkitt tumor biopsies indicates that tumor tissue contains RNA homologous to at least 3–6% of the DNA of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Most of these RNA species accumulate in the polyadenylated RNA fraction of Burkitt tumor tissue. Two approaches have been used to determine the location within the EBV genome of the DNA sequences which encode stable RNA in two Burkitt tumor biopsies, F and S, which contain 6–10 copies per cell of at least 80% of the EBV genome. With the first approach, 32P-EBV DNA homologous to polyadenylated or nonpolyadenylated RNAs from the F, S or R tumors was hybridized to blots of fragments of EBV DNA. With the second approach, polyadenylated or nonpolyadenylated RNAs from the F or S tumors were hybridized to separated, labeled fragments of EBV DNA in solution. The results indicate that first, most of the viral RNA in Burkitt tumor tissue is encoded by approximately 20% of the Hsu I D fragment, 20% of the Eco RI A/Hsu I A double-cut fragment and 3% of the Hsu I B fragment of EBV DNA; second, an abundant RNA species in tumor tissue is homologous to the “additional DNA” present in the W91 and Jijoye/HR-I Burkitt tumor isolates of EBV and absent in the B95-8 virus, an isolate of EBV from outside the Burkitt endemic region; and third, there is little or no homology to other regions of the EBV genome."

Thirteen of sixteen hr-t mutants examined carry deletions 2 to 5 map units (100--250 bp) long in Hpa 11-4. Three mutants carry either point mutations or very small deletions/insertions. Eight of the deletion mutants were mapped closely with restriction enzymes. Seven of them have deletions located entirely within the Hae III subfragment A of Hpa II-4 (the Hae A subfragment, 78.4--85.2 map units), and one extends just beyond this subfragment, ending at 85.5 map units. The complete sequence of the wild-type Hae A subfragment was determined and compared with those of four deletion mutants, NG-18, A-8, 6B5 and B-2. The deletion in each of these mutants is out-of-phase: NG-18, 187 bp; A-8, 127 bp; 6B-5, 179 bp; B-2, 241 bp.

The block to expression of the transformed state in these cellular revertants was spontaneously reversible at low frequency. Moreover, infection with certain helper viruses reversed the block at very high efficiency. Helper virus complementation was shown not to be a direct effect of helper virus functions expressed in the initially infected revertant cell. Rather, the helper virus acted indirectly by rescuing sarcoma virus and allowing it to infect and transform another cell within the revertant population. Using biochemical and immunologic techniques, it was possible to demonstrate a specific and very marked reduction in transcriptional and translational products of the sarcoma viral genome in the revertant cells. Findings that the reversal of this block was associated with reacquisition of the transformed phenotype, together with other evidence, suggest that reversion results from cellular transcriptional regulation of the integrated sarcoma virus genome. Reversion in this virus transformation system provides a model for oncogenesis resulting from derepression of cellular genes that possess malignant potential."

In contrast to wild-type and heterozygous littermates, homozygous tw18/tw18 6 and 8 day embryos have very limited growth potentialities in vitro. When transplanted under the testis capsule, homozygous tw18 embryos (3, 6 and 7 day) produce teratomas at a much lower efficiency than heterozygous and wild-type embryos, and the rare teratomas thus obtained have limited growth potentialities when cultured in vitro. Upon transformation with SV40, however, permanent lines of cells of mesodermal origin, capable of myoblastic or adipocytic differentiation, have been obtained. This shows that the effect of the mutation on cell growth can be overcome by SV40 transformation."
