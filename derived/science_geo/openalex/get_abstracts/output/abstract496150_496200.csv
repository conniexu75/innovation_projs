https://openalex.org/W2011687861,"Efforts to derive hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) are complicated by the fact that embryonic hematopoiesis consists of two programs, primitive and definitive, that differ in developmental potential. As only definitive hematopoiesis generates HSCs, understanding how this program develops is essential for being able to produce this cell population in vitro. Here we show that both hematopoietic programs transition through hemogenic endothelial intermediates and develop from KDR(+)CD34(-)CD144(-) progenitors that are distinguished by CD235a expression. Generation of primitive progenitors (KDR(+)CD235a(+)) depends on stage-specific activin-nodal signaling and inhibition of the Wnt-β-catenin pathway, whereas specification of definitive progenitors (KDR(+)CD235a(-)) requires Wnt-β-catenin signaling during this same time frame. Together, these findings establish simple selective differentiation strategies for the generation of primitive or definitive hematopoietic progenitors by Wnt-β-catenin manipulation, and in doing so provide access to enriched populations for future studies on hPSC-derived hematopoietic development."

https://openalex.org/W1970729332,"Unbiased high-throughput sequencing of whole metagenome shotgun DNA libraries is a promising new approach to identifying microbes in clinical specimens, which, unlike other techniques, is not limited to known sequences. Unlike most sequencing applications, it is highly sensitive to laboratory contaminants as these will appear to originate from the clinical specimens. To assess the extent and diversity of sequence contaminants, we aligned 57 ""1000 Genomes Project"" sequencing runs from six centers against the four largest NCBI BLAST databases, detecting reads of diverse contaminant species in all runs and identifying the most common of these contaminant genera (Bradyrhizobium) in assembled genomes from the NCBI Genome database. Many of these microorganisms have been reported as contaminants of ultrapure water systems. Studies aiming to identify novel microbes in clinical specimens will greatly benefit from not only preventive measures such as extensive UV irradiation of water and cross-validation using independent techniques, but also a concerted effort to sequence the complete genomes of common contaminants so that they may be subtracted computationally."
https://openalex.org/W1972611386,"The present study is focused on the extracellular synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using culture supernatant of an agriculturally important bacterium, Serratia sp. BHU-S4 and demonstrates its effective application for the management of spot blotch disease in wheat. The biosynthesis of AgNPs by Serratia sp. BHU-S4 (denoted as bsAgNPs) was monitored by UV–visible spectrum that showed the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) peak at 410 nm, an important characteristic of AgNPs. Furthermore, the structural, morphological, elemental, functional and thermal characterization of bsAgNPs was carried out using the X-ray diffraction (XRD), electron and atomic microscopies, energy dispersive X-ray (EDAX) spectrometer, FTIR spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA), respectively. The bsAgNPs were spherical in shape with size range of ∼10 to 20 nm. The XRD and EDAX analysis confirmed successful biosynthesis and crystalline nature of AgNPs. The bsAgNPs exhibited strong antifungal activity against Bipolaris sorokiniana, the spot blotch pathogen of wheat. Interestingly, 2, 4 and 10 µg/ml concentrations of bsAgNPs accounted for complete inhibition of conidial germination, whereas in the absence of bsAgNPs, conidial germination was 100%. A detached leaf bioassay revealed prominent conidial germination on wheat leaves infected with B. sorokiniana conidial suspension alone, while the germination of conidia was totally inhibited when the leaves were treated with bsAgNPs. The results were further authenticated under green house conditions, where application of bsAgNPs significantly reduced B. sorokiniana infection in wheat plants. Histochemical staining revealed a significant role of bsAgNPs treatment in inducing lignin deposition in vascular bundles. In summary, our findings represent the efficient application of bsAgNPs in plant disease management, indicating the exciting possibilities of nanofungicide employing agriculturally important bacteria."

Here we describe the physiological, molecular, and behavioral phenotyping of a Cdkl5 conditional knockout mouse model of CDKL5 disorder. Behavioral analysis of constitutive Cdkl5 knockout mice revealed key features of the human disorder, including limb clasping, hypoactivity, and abnormal eye tracking. Anatomical, physiological, and molecular analysis of the knockout uncovered potential pathological substrates of the disorder, including reduced dendritic arborization of cortical neurons, abnormal electroencephalograph (EEG) responses to convulsant treatment, decreased visual evoked responses (VEPs), and alterations in the Akt/rpS6 signaling pathway. Selective knockout of Cdkl5 in excitatory and inhibitory forebrain neurons allowed us to map the behavioral features of the disorder to separable cell-types. These findings identify physiological and molecular deficits in specific forebrain neuron populations as possible pathological substrates in CDKL5 disorder."
https://openalex.org/W2129810141,"This study investigated the effect of cold plasma seed treatment on tomato bacterial wilt, caused by Ralstonia solanacearum (R. solanacearum), and the regulation of resistance mechanisms. The effect of cold plasma of 80W on seed germination, plant growth, nutrient uptake, disease severity, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) concentration and activities of peroxidase (POD; EC 1.11.1.7), polyphenol oxidase (PPO; EC 1.10.3.2) and phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL; EC 4.3.1.5) were examined in tomato plants. Plasma treatment increased tomato resistance to R. solanacearum with an efficacy of 25.0%. Plasma treatment significantly increased both germination and plant growth in comparison with the control treatment, and plasma-treated plants absorbed more calcium and boron than the controls. In addition, H2O2 levels in treated plants rose faster and reached a higher peak, at 2.579 µM gFW−1, 140% greater than that of the control. Activities of POD (421.3 U gFW−1), PPO (508.8 U gFW−1) and PAL (707.3 U gFW−1) were also greater in the treated plants than in the controls (103.0 U gFW−1, 166.0 U gFW−1 and 309.4 U gFW−1, respectively). These results suggest that plasma treatment affects the regulation of plant growth, H2O2 concentration, and POD, PPO and PAL activity in tomato, resulting in an improved resistance to R. solanacearum. Consequently, cold plasma seed treatment has the potential to control tomato bacterial wilt caused by R. solanacearum."
https://openalex.org/W2151854382,"High-throughput sequencing of related individuals has become an important tool for studying human disease. However, owing to technical complexity and lack of available tools, most pedigree-based sequencing studies rely on an ad hoc combination of suboptimal analyses. Here we present pedigree-VAAST (pVAAST), a disease-gene identification tool designed for high-throughput sequence data in pedigrees. pVAAST uses a sequence-based model to perform variant and gene-based linkage analysis. Linkage information is then combined with functional prediction and rare variant case-control association information in a unified statistical framework. pVAAST outperformed linkage and rare-variant association tests in simulations and identified disease-causing genes from whole-genome sequence data in three human pedigrees with dominant, recessive and de novo inheritance patterns. The approach is robust to incomplete penetrance and locus heterogeneity and is applicable to a wide variety of genetic traits. pVAAST maintains high power across studies of monogenic, high-penetrance phenotypes in a single pedigree to highly polygenic, common phenotypes involving hundreds of pedigrees."
https://openalex.org/W1982370923,"In patients chronically infected with hepatitis C virus and in the HCV cell culture system (HCVcc), it is known that highly infectious virus particles have low to very low buoyant densities. These low densities have been attributed to the association of HCV with lipoprotein components, which occur during the viral morphogenesis. The resulting hybrid particles are known as lipoviral particles (LVP); however, very little is known about how these particles are created. In our study, we used Huh7.5 cells to investigate the intracellular association between envelope proteins and apolipoproteins B and E (ApoB and ApoE, respectively). In particular, we were interested in the role of this association in initiating LVP morphogenesis. Co-immunoprecipitation assays revealed that ApoB, ApoE, and HCV glycoproteins formed a protein complex early in the HCV lifecycle. Confocal analyses of naïve, E1E2-transduced and HCVcc-infected cells showed that HCV glycoproteins, ApoB and ApoE were found strongly colocalized only in the endoplasmic reticulum. We also found that HCV glycoproteins, ApoB and ApoE were already associated with intracellular infectious viral particles and, furthermore, that the protein complex was conserved in the infectious viral particles present in the supernatant of infected Huh7.5 cells. The association of HCV glycoproteins with ApoE was also evidenced in the HCVpp system, using the non-hepatic HEK293T cell line. We suggest that the complex formed by HCV E1E2, ApoB, and ApoE may initiate lipoviral particle morphogenesis.

Hepatitis C virus particles circulate in patients as hybrid particles, known as lipoviral particles (LVPs), consisting of a combination of HCV and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) components (1André P.

LVPs have low densities (<1.06 g/ml) and are highly infectious. They are rich in triacylglycerol and total cholesterol and contain the viral RNA, the capsid protein, envelope glycoproteins, and apolipoproteins B, E, and C1 (ApoB, ApoE, and ApoC1). ApoB, ApoE, and ApoC1 are essential components of the β-lipoproteins LDL and VLDL. It is currently thought that the maturation and release of infectious HCV particles are closely associated with the VLDL synthesis pathway. Similar characteristics have been described for viruses produced in cell culture (HCVcc) by human Huh7.5 hepatoma cells (4Gastaminza P. Cheng G. Wieland S. Zhong J. Liao W. Chisari F.V.

The specific infectivity of HCVcc particles is significantly lower than that of HCV produced in vivo, with most of the viral RNA associated with particles of lower infectivity and a slightly higher density (8Lindenbach B.D.

However, the mechanisms of LVP morphogenesis and the specific structure of these hybrid viral particles remain poorly understood. Following an as yet unidentified triggering event, the nucleocapsid (NC) is translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it associates with glycoproteins, forming HCV RNA-containing particles. The initial viral structure associates with apolipoproteins along the VLDL maturation pathway, generating viral particles of low density, but high infectivity, which are secreted via the secretory pathway of the host cell (for review see Refs. 11Suzuki T.

However, this interpretation of events is largely speculative, and conflicting data have recently been reported concerning HCVcc morphogenesis. Two studies have reported that microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) plays a key role in HCV assembly and secretion (4Gastaminza P. Cheng G. Wieland S. Zhong J. Liao W. Chisari F.V.

The authors also reported that interfering RNAs directed against ApoB inhibited the release of infectious viral particles, indicating that ApoB may be a limiting factor for HCV assembly. Together, these results suggest that ApoB is required for HCV assembly. By contrast, other studies have indicated that ApoE is essential for the assembly and release of infectious particles, whereas ApoB and MTP have little or no effect on these mechanisms (13Jiang J.

Finally, electron microscopy studies of the ultrastructure of purified HCVcc virions have shown that viral particles are associated with ApoE only (18Merz A. Long G. Hiet M.S. Brügger B. Chlanda P.

In this study, we aimed to unravel the mechanisms governing the initiation of interactions between the VLDL and HCV components and the incorporation of apolipoproteins into mature infectious particles. We also attempted to define the role played by ApoB and ApoE in viral infectivity and morphogenesis. We show that ApoB and ApoE form stable associations not only with each other, but also with the HCV glycoproteins. These proteins were found colocalized in the ER only. We show that this association is conserved, for both apolipoproteins and E1E2, in infectious intracellular or extracellular HCV particles. The association of HCV glycoproteins with ApoE was also evidenced in the HCVpp system, using the non-hepatic HEK293T cell line. Our findings demonstrate that HCV glycoproteins, ApoB and ApoE have an intrinsic capacity to form a complex early in viral morphogenesis. This association could potentially trigger the formation of infectious hybrid particles (LVPs) containing viral and lipoprotein components. We used Huh7.5-E1E2 cells, corresponding to Huh7.5 cells transduced with HCV E1E2 (JFH1 strain), using pseudotyped retroviral particles. Huh7.5-HCVcc cells are Huh7.5 cells carrying the JFH1 strain of HCV. We lysed Huh7.5, Huh7.5-E1E2, and HCVcc cells in 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, protease inhibitor mixture in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)). Pseudotyped retroviral particles were produced in HEK293T cells by standard methods (20Meunier J.C. Russell R.S. Engle R.E. Faulk K.N. Purcell R.H. Emerson S.U.

Infectious hepatitis C virus pseudo-particles containing functional E1-E2 envelope protein complexes.J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 633-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar). Briefly, retroviral particles were produced from three plasmids: a cytomegalovirus-Gag-Pol packaging construct, a murine leukemia virus HCV E1E2-transducing plasmid, and an expression vector encoding vesicular stomatitis virus G protein. The HCV E1E2-transducing plasmid was obtained by replacing the GFP sequence of the original plasmid with the HCV envelope protein sequences via a PCR-based strategy, making use of the AgeI and SalI restriction sites. The human monoclonal anti-E2AR3A Ab (AR3A) and human monoclonal anti-E1E2 complex Abs (AR4A and AR5A) (22Giang E. Dorner M. Prentoe J.C. Dreux M. Evans M.J. Bukh J. Rice C.M. Ploss A. Burton D.R.

The following antibodies were purchased: mouse monoclonal anti-core Ab (C7–50: MA1–080, Thermo Scientific), goat polyclonal anti-ApoBRock Ab (600-101-111, Rockland), rabbit polyclonal anti-ApoBOrb Ab (orb100584, Biorbyt), goat polyclonal anti-ApoBR&D Ab (AF3556, R&D Systems), goat polyclonal anti-ApoE Ab (AB947, Millipore), rabbit polyclonal anti-calnexin Ab (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.), mouse monoclonal anti-GM130 Ab (BD Transduction Laboratories), IgG isotypic control: polyclonal goat IgG, purified human IgG, monoclonal mouse IgG1 (respectively AB-108-C, 1-001-A, MAB002, R&D Systems). Cells were grown on 12-mm glass coverslips for 72 h. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and then permeabilized with 0.1% Tween 20–2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS. Cells were double-labeled by incubation overnight with the primary antibody in permeabilization buffer. They were then incubated with the secondary Ab in the same buffer. Confocal microscopy was performed with an Olympus Fluoview 500 confocal microscope. Colocalization was evaluated as previously described (24Costes S.V. Daelemans D. Cho E.H. Dobbin Z. Pavlakis G. Lockett S. Automatic and quantitative measurement of protein-protein colocalization in live cells.Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 3993-4003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar). The extent of colocalization of the two labels was measured with the “Colocalization” module of Imaris 7.2.3 × 64 (Bitplane AG, Saint Paul, MN). The extent of colocalization was assessed by two different measurements: 1) The percentage of material colocalized, determined by the Imaris software. The program produces a measurement of colocalization for each of the labels. Two values (A and B) for the percentage were obtained, corresponding to each of the Abs used. 2) The Pearson's coefficient. The Pearson coefficient measures the correlation between the intensities of the two labels displaying colocalization in stacks of confocal sections acquired in two channels. This method provides a statistical evaluation of protein colocalization. Pearson's coefficient is a number between +1 and −1, with positive values indicating a direct correlation, negative values indicating an inverse correlation, and values near 0 indicating no correlation. Clarified cell lysates were incubated with anti-E2AR3A (3 μg), anti-E1E2AR4A (3 μg), anti-E1E2AR5A (3 μg), anti-ApoE (AB947, Millipore) (4 μl serum), or anti-ApoBRock (600-101-111, Rockland) (4 μl) antibodies and 100 μl of Sepharose bead slurry (rec-Protein G-Sepharose® 4B Conjugate, Invitrogen) in PBS. The beads were washed four times in PBS (0.1% Triton X-100), and immunocomplexes were analyzed by Western blotting. Samples were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), and the bands obtained were transferred electrophoretically to Hybond®-C Extra (GE Healthcare) nitrocellulose membranes with a Trans-Blot apparatus (Bio-Rad) and probed with anti-E23/11, anti-ApoE, or anti-ApoBR&D antibodies, followed by a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Labeled antibodies were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Millipore), according to the procedure recommended by the kit manufacturer. For the neutralization assay, triplicate samples of intracellular HCVcc or extracellular HCVcc (supernatant) were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with an anti-E2AR3A (2 μg), anti-ApoB4G3 (4 μg) or anti-ApoE (5 μl serum) Ab before cell inoculation. For the anti-ApoE serum Ab, 1 μl of serum contains ∼3 μg of Ab in total, according to the data supplied by the manufacturer. Intracellular HCVcc was prepared as previously described (6Gastaminza P. Kapadia S.B. Chisari F.V. Differential biophysical properties of infectious intracellular and secreted hepatitis C virus particles.J. Virol. 2006; 80: 11074-11081Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). For immunodepletion assays, protein G-Sepharose beads were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the same amounts of the same Ab as for neutralization and then washed with PBS. Triplicate samples of intra- or extracellular HCVcc were then mixed with beads and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The beads were discarded, and the infectious virus remaining in the supernatant was used to inoculate cells. For both assays, cells were stained 3 days later with an anti-HCV core protein Ab (C7–50) and viral foci were counted manually. The percentage inhibition was calculated by comparing levels with those for the irrelevant IgG. Protein G-Sepharose beads were incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-E2AR3A (8 μg), anti-ApoBOrb (16 μg), anti-ApoE (4 μl serum), or control IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (8 μg) and then washed with PBS. Triplicate samples of extracellular HCVcc were then mixed with the beads and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C (Step 1: Immunosubtraction). Beads were collected, and the amounts of HCV RNA or HCV core remaining in the supernatant were determined. The supernatant, containing unbound particles, was then mixed with a second set of beads prepared with the indicated Abs, in the same conditions as for step 1. Beads were collected, and the amounts of HCV RNA or HCV core remaining in the supernatant were determined (Step 2: Immunodepletion). The amounts of HCV RNA or HCV core bound to beads prepared with specific Abs were calculated by comparison with those on beads prepared with irrelevant IgG. HCV RNA was quantified with the routine Abbot m2000sp-m2000rt real-time PCR assay. HCV core was quantified in a fully automated microparticle chemiluminescence immunoassay (Architect HCV Ag; Abbot). Huh7.5 cells were used to seed 24-well plates at a density of 4 × 104cells/well and cultured overnight. The next day, 400 μl of HEK293T cell supernatant containing HCVpp was combined with 5, 10, or 20 μl of anti-ApoE serum, 2 μg of anti-E2AR3A, 2 μg of anti-ApoB1D1 Ab or corresponding amounts of isotypic Abs and incubated for 8 h at 37 °C. Huh7.5 cells were subjected to infection with these mixtures for 3 days. We then analyzed GFP expression in 104 cells with a GalliosTM flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter). In serum samples from patients, HCV particles are associated with very low-density lipoprotein components (cholesterol and apolipoproteins: ApoB, ApoE, ApoCI). Indeed, HCV hijacks the VLDL pathway during its morphogenesis. The resulting complexes are known as lipoviral particles. VLDL morphogenesis is initiated in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) before the delivery of the pre-VLDL to the Golgi apparatus (25Tiwari S. Siddiqi S.A.

We investigated the role of HCV glycoproteins in the initiation of LVP formation by transducing Huh7.5 cells with E1E2 sequences only (Huh7.5-E1E2). These two proteins have been shown to form a heterodimer that is retained in the ER (26Cocquerel L. Meunier J.C. Pillez A. Wychowski C. Dubuisson J. A retention signal necessary and sufficient for endoplasmic reticulum localization maps to the transmembrane domain of hepatitis C virus glycoprotein E2.J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2183-2191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The association of envelope proteins and apolipoproteins was also investigated in the context of a complete viral cycle (Huh7.5-HCVcc), with HCVcc-infected cells (JFH1 strain). Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy analysis and co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed to evaluate the association of ApoB, ApoE, and HCV E2 in Huh7.5, Huh7.5-E1E2, and Huh7.5-HCVcc cells. In addition, Giang et al. recently isolated anti-E1E2 Abs (AR4A and AR5A) recognizing different antigenic regions of the virus envelope glycoprotein complex and requiring correct folding of the E1E2 complex for binding (22Giang E. Dorner M. Prentoe J.C. Dreux M. Evans M.J. Bukh J. Rice C.M. Ploss A. Burton D.R. Law M. Human broadly neutralizing antibodies to the envelope glycoprotein complex of hepatitis C virus.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 6205-6210Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). These Abs were also used in our immunoprecipitation experiments. The co-immunoprecipitation with ApoB (anti-ApoBRock Ab) was observed in all our cell systems for ApoE and in Huh7.5-E1E2 and Huh7.5-HCVcc cells for E2 (Fig. 1, A–C). Following immunoprecipitation with anti-E2AR3A, anti-E1E2AR4A, or anti-E1E2AR5A Abs, ApoB was systematically detected (Fig. 1, A and B). ApoE was strongly detected when anti-E1E2AR5A was used (Fig. 1, A and B). Pull-down was less efficient when we used anti-E2AR3A and anti-E1E2AR4A Abs. The co-immunoprecipitation of ApoB and ApoE with an anti-E2 antibody was most efficient with anti-E1E2AR5A Ab, the binding of which is dependent on the correct folding of the E1E2 complex. Of note, we calculated (using ImageJ) the efficiency of protein immunoprecipitation of our Abs when used as described above. We found that ∼20, 50, 40, 30, and 20% of target proteins from a HCVcc cell lysate was pulled-down when anti-ApoB, Anti-ApoE, anti-E2AR3A, anti-E2AR4A, and anti-E1E2AR5A was used, respectively. We observed weaker co-immunoprecipitation of E2 with anti-ApoE antibody, whereas ApoB was detected as a faint band (Fig. 1, A–C). One previous study showed an association of E1, but not E2, with apolipoproteins (28Mazumdar B. Banerjee A. Meyer K. Ray R. Hepatitis C virus E1 envelope glycoprotein interacts with apolipoproteins in facilitating entry into hepatocytes.Hepatology. 2011; 54: 1149-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However in our study, as the HCV E1 and E2 glycoproteins are believed to form a complex, either within cells or on infectious particles, the detection of HCV E2 glycoprotein presumably also indicates the presence of HCV E1 (referred to as “E1E2”). The apparent efficiencies of co-immunoprecipitation seemed to differ markedly between anti-ApoB, anti-ApoE, and anti-E2 antibodies. In particular, as described above, the anti-ApoE Ab failed to unambiguously pull down ApoB. Also we tested seven different anti-ApoB Abs to identify one (anti-ApoBRock) giving a positive pull-down (Fig. 1). It therefore seems highly likely that the quality of the Abs used for immunoprecipitation and the efficiency of the Abs used for detection of the precipitated proteins influence the results obtained. We hypothesize that the ambiguous result obtained with the anti-ApoE Ab may reflect the use of inadequate Abs for pull-down rather than an absence of interaction. In addition, we performed an immunoprecipitation on E1E2-transduced HEK293T cells lysate using the anti-ApoBRock to demonstrate the specificity of this Ab. It has been demonstrated before that the HEK293T cell line does not express ApoB (27Tanner S. Shen Z. Ng J. Florea L. Guigó R. Briggs S.P. Bafna V. Improving gene annotation using peptide mass spectrometry.Genome Res. 2007; 17: 231-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). When the anti-ApoBRock was used, the immunoprecipitation of E2 was not detected. In contrast, an immunoprecipitation using AR3A on the same cells lysate yielded a positive result (data not shown). Thus, this experiment demonstrates that the anti-ApoBRock does not cross-react with E1E2. Nevertheless, these data indicate, overall, that HCV E1E2, ApoB and ApoE associate during viral morphogenesis either directly or through an unknown partner. This association occurs early during viral life cycle and is not dependent on the presence of other viral proteins since glycoproteins and apolipoprotein association was detected in Huh7.5-E1E2 cells. The subcellular distributions of apolipoproteins and HCV E2 have been investigated before (25Tiwari S. Siddiqi S.A. Intracellular trafficking and secretion of VLDL.Arterioscl. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2012; 32: 1079-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 29Rouillé Y. Helle F. Delgrange D. Roingeard P. Voisset C. Blanchard E. Belouzard S. McKeating J. Patel A.H. Maertens G.

Virol. 2006; 80: 2832-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, we wanted to establish in which sub-cellular compartment the interaction of ApoB, ApoE, and E2 may most likely be initiated. Thus the colocalization of these proteins was investigated in our Huh7.5 cells (Huh7.5-E1E2 or Huh7.5-HCVcc), in confocal immunofluorescence microscopy analysis using Imaris colocalization software. Double-immunolabeling experiments were carried out with anti-ApoB, anti-ApoE and anti-E2 Abs, together with antibodies specific for the ER (anti-calnexin) and Golgi apparatus (anti-GM130). ApoB and ApoE strongly colocalized with calnexin (Fig. 2, A and B) and the percentage of material colocalized in Huh7.5-E1E2 and Huh7.5-HCVcc cells was high, with a Pearson coefficient similar to or greater than that of the positive control (Fig. 2, C and D). HCV E2 and calnexin were strongly colocalized in Huh7.5-E1E2 cells (Fig. 2, A and B) as shown by the percentage colocalization and the Pearson coefficient (Fig. 2C). However, we found that only a fraction of the E2 protein colocalized with calnexin in Huh7.5-HCVcc cells, and a non-negligible percentage of material colocalized with GM130 (Fig. 2, B and D), by contrast to previous reports. However, Pearson's coefficient was close to zero (Fig. 2D), indicating that the colocalization of HCV E2 with Golgi compartment's protein was barely detectable. In both cell systems, no significant colocalization of ApoB and ApoE with GM130 was observed (Fig. 2, A and B). In Huh7.5-E1E2 and Huh7.5-HCVcc cells, the percentage of material colocalized was high for HCV E2 and ApoB or ApoE, with a Pearson coefficient similar to or greater than that of the positive control (Fig. 1F). ApoB and ApoE were consistently found to be colocalized (Fig. 1, D and E). Altogether, these quantitative and statistical analyses showed that ApoB, ApoE, and HCV glycoproteins were found strongly colocalized only in the endoplasmic reticulum. These results are consistent with those of previous studies. This colocalization occurs early in LVP morphogenesis, because HCV E2 colocalization with ApoB or ApoE in ER was observed in Huh7.5-E1E2 cells. This colocali"

If measurement of spontaneous pain behaviours can be used to generate an analgesic intervention score their use could expand to guide the use of analgesics, as mandated by regulatory bodies and ethical and welfare obligations. One such measure of spontaneous pain, the Rat Grimace Scale (RGS), has recently been described and shown to exhibit reliability. However, reliability of measurement scores is context and content specific, and further testing required to assess translation to a heterogenous setting (different model, raters, environment). The objectives of this study were to perform reliability testing with the Rat Grimace Scale in a heterogenous setting and generate an analgesic intervention score for its use. In a randomised, blinded study, sixteen adult female rats received one of three analgesia treatments (0.05 mg/kg buprenorphine subcutaneously, 1 mg/kg meloxicam subcutaneously, 0.2 mg/kg oral buprenorphine in jelly) peri-operatively (telemetry unit implantation surgery). Rats were video-recorded (before, 1-6 and 12 hours post-operatively) and images collected for independent scoring by three blinded raters using the RGS, and five experts based on ""pain/no pain"" assessment. Scores were used to calculate inter- and intra-rater reliability with an intraclass correlation coefficient and generate an analgesic intervention score with receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. The RGS scores showed very good inter- and intra-rater reliability (0.85 [0.78-0.90 95% CI] and 0.83 [0.76-0.89], respectively). An analgesic intervention threshold of greater than 0.67 was determined. These data demonstrate that the RGS is a useful tool which can be successfully employed in a heterogenous setting, and has the potential to guide analgesic intervention."

https://openalex.org/W2135946078,"Large carnivores were persecuted to near extinction during the last centuries, but have now recovered in some countries. It has been proposed earlier that the recovery of the Northern European brown bear is supported by migration from Russia. We tested this hypothesis by obtaining for the first time continuous sampling of the whole Finnish bear population, which is located centrally between the Russian and Scandinavian bear populations. The Finnish population is assumed to experience high gene flow from Russian Karelia. If so, no or a low degree of genetic differentiation between Finnish and Russian bears could be expected. We have genotyped bears extensively from all over Finland using 12 validated microsatellite markers and compared their genetic composition to bears from Russian Karelia, Sweden, and Norway. Our fine masked investigation identified two overlapping genetic clusters structured by isolation-by-distance in Finland (pairwise FST = 0.025). One cluster included Russian bears, and migration analyses showed a high number of migrants from Russia into Finland, providing evidence of eastern gene flow as an important driver during recovery. In comparison, both clusters excluded bears from Sweden and Norway, and we found no migrants from Finland in either country, indicating that eastern gene flow was probably not important for the population recovery in Scandinavia. Our analyses on different spatial scales suggest a continuous bear population in Finland and Russian Karelia, separated from Scandinavia."

Imaging included 2D PC imaging, multiple b value DWI and MRE. Subjects were initially scanned twice in fasting state to assess short-term parameter reproducibility, and then scanned 20 min. after a liquid meal. PV flow/velocity, LS, liver true diffusion coefficient (D), pseudodiffusion coefficient (D*), perfusion fraction (PF) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were measured in fasting and postprandial conditions. Short-term reproducibility was assessed in fasting conditions by measuring coefficients of variation (CV) and Bland-Altman limits of agreement. Differences in MR metrics before and after caloric intake and between healthy volunteers and liver disease patients were assessed.PV flow parameters, D, ADC and LS showed good to excellent short-term reproducibility in fasting state (CV <16%), while PF and D* showed acceptable and poor reproducibility (CV = 20.4% and 51.6%, respectively). PV flow parameters and LS were significantly higher (p<0.04) in postprandial state while liver diffusion parameters showed no significant change (p>0.2). LS was significantly higher in liver disease patients compared to healthy volunteers both in fasting and postprandial conditions (p<0.001). Changes in LS were significantly correlated with changes in PV flow (Spearman rho = 0.48, p = 0.013).Caloric intake had no/minimal/large impact on diffusion/stiffness/portal vein flow, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W2011408957,"Background Salt stress interferes with plant growth and production. Plants have evolved a series of molecular and morphological adaptations to cope with this abiotic stress, and overexpression of salt response genes reportedly enhances the productivity of various crops. However, little is known about the salt responsive genes in the energy plant physic nut (Jatropha curcas L.). Thus, excavate salt responsive genes in this plant are informative in uncovering the molecular mechanisms for the salt response in physic nut. Methodology/Principal Findings We applied next-generation Illumina sequencing technology to analyze global gene expression profiles of physic nut plants (roots and leaves) 2 hours, 2 days and 7 days after the onset of salt stress. A total of 1,504 and 1,115 genes were significantly up and down-regulated in roots and leaves, respectively, under salt stress condition. Gene ontology (GO) analysis of physiological process revealed that, in the physic nut, many “biological processes” were affected by salt stress, particular those categories belong to “metabolic process”, such as “primary metabolism process”, “cellular metabolism process” and “macromolecule metabolism process”. The gene expression profiles indicated that the associated genes were responsible for ABA and ethylene signaling, osmotic regulation, the reactive oxygen species scavenging system and the cell structure in physic nut. Conclusions/Significance The major regulated genes detected in this transcriptomic data were related to trehalose synthesis and cell wall structure modification in roots, while related to raffinose synthesis and reactive oxygen scavenger in leaves. The current study shows a comprehensive gene expression profile of physic nut under salt stress. The differential expression genes detected in this study allows the underling the salt responsive mechanism in physic nut with the aim of improving its salt resistance in the future."
https://openalex.org/W1972570658,"Mercury (Hg) is a serious environmental pollution threat to the planet. The accumulation of Hg in plants disrupts many cellular-level functions and inhibits growth and development, but the mechanism is not fully understood. To gain more insight into the cellular response to Hg, we performed a large-scale analysis of the rice transcriptome during Hg stress. Genes induced with short-term exposure represented functional categories of cell-wall formation, chemical detoxification, secondary metabolism, signal transduction and abiotic stress response. Moreover, Hg stress upregulated several genes involved in aromatic amino acids (Phe and Trp) and increased the level of free Phe and Trp content. Exogenous application of Phe and Trp to rice roots enhanced tolerance to Hg and effectively reduced Hg-induced production of reactive oxygen species. Hg induced calcium accumulation and activated mitogen-activated protein kinase. Further characterization of the Hg-responsive genes we identified may be helpful for better understanding the mechanisms of Hg in plants."
https://openalex.org/W2011647977,"Hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) are the third leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. The highest rates of early onset HCCs occur in geographical regions with high aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) exposure, concomitant with hepatitis B infection. Although the carcinogenic basis of AFB1 has been ascribed to its mutagenic effects, the mutagenic property of the primary AFB1-DNA adduct, AFB1-N7-Gua, in mammalian cells has not been studied extensively. Taking advantage of the ability to create vectors containing a site-specific DNA adduct, the mutagenic potential was determined in primate cells. This adduct was highly mutagenic following replication in COS-7 cells, with a mutation frequency of 45%. The spectrum of mutations was predominantly G to T base substitutions, a result that is consistent with previous mutation data derived from aflatoxin-associated HCCs. To assess which DNA polymerases (pol) might contribute to the mutational outcome, in vitro replication studies were performed. Unexpectedly, replicative pol δ and the error-prone translesion synthesis pol ζ were able to accurately bypass AFB1-N7-Gua. In contrast, replication bypass using pol κ was shown to occur with low fidelity and could account for the commonly detected G to T transversions."

However, researchers have not yet been able to provide insights into how psychological and behavioral states actually change during positive and negative team momentum. In the current study we aimed to provide these insights by introducing an experimental dynamical research design. Rowing pairs had to compete against a virtual opponent on rowing ergometers, while a screen in front of the team broadcasted the ongoing race. The race was manipulated so that the team's rowing avatar gradually progressed (positive momentum) or regressed (negative momentum) in relation to the victory. The participants responded verbally to collective efficacy and task cohesion items appearing on the screen each minute. In addition, effort exertion and interpersonal coordination were continuously measured. Our results showed negative psychological changes (perceptions of collective efficacy and task cohesion) during negative team momentum, which were stronger than the positive changes during positive team momentum. Moreover, teams' exerted efforts rapidly decreased during negative momentum, whereas positive momentum accompanied a more variable and adaptive sequence of effort exertion. Finally, the interpersonal coordination was worse during negative momentum than during positive momentum. These results provide the first empirical insights into actual team momentum dynamics, and demonstrate how a dynamical research approach significantly contributes to current knowledge on psychological and behavioral processes."

Based on the importance of TRA-3 in neuron death in C. elegans and the relatively high expression of Capn5 mRNA in the brain, we sought to further explore CAPN5 in the mammalian CNS. The University of Kentucky Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved all procedures involving experimental animals. Animals included Male Sprague-Dawley rats and Capn5 heterozygous mice (C57BL/6J-Capn5tm1Dgen/J; Capn5+/LacZ). These mice, created by DeltaGen (San Mateo, CA) (24Moore M.W. High-throughput gene knockouts and phenotyping in mice.Ernst Schering Res. Found. Workshop. 2005; 50: 27-44Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar), were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) on a B6.129P2 background and then back-crossed onto C57BL/6J for 10 generations. For Western blot and fractionation studies, rats were exsanguinated using CO2 inhalation followed by decapitation. Brains were removed rapidly and homogenized in the appropriate buffer for Western blot, fractionation, or RNA isolation as described below. For immunohistochemical and X-gal staining studies, rats or mice were first perfused with PBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.4.

Additional reagents were purchased from Sigma or Thermo Fisher Scientific. Brain samples were homogenized in TRI Reagent to extract total RNA. cDNA was prepared using an Applied Biosystems high capacity reverse transcription kit (AB 4368814). Equal amounts of cDNA (100 ng) were used to perform quantitative PCR using TaqMan gene expression master mix (AB 4369016). Reactions were performed in triplicate plus a negative control without cDNA. The quantitative PCR was programmed as an initial denaturation at 50 °C for 2 min followed by 95 °C for 10 min, 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s, and 60 °C for 1 min on a StepOne real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). The following rat gene transcripts were examined: Capn1 (NCBI reference sequence NM_019152.2, TaqMan gene expression assay Rn00569689_m1); Capn2 (NM_017116.2, Rn00567422_m1); Capn5 (NM_134461.1, Rn00593213_m1); Capn7 (NM_001030037.1, Rn01453530_m1); Capn10 (NM_031673.2, Rn00581535_m1); and Gapdh (NP_058704, Rn99999916-s1). Relative gene expression was determined using comparative CT values. ΔCT of the target gene was obtained as a difference in the CT value from endogenous control GAPDH. The ΔΔCT value of the target gene was calculated by subtracting ΔCT value of the target gene from the ΔCT of a reference gene, Capn1. The relative expression of the target gene was then reported as 2−ΔΔCT. Brain cortices were homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer in isolation buffer containing 215 mm mannitol, 75 mm sucrose, 1 mm EGTA, 20 mm HEPES, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1300 × g for 3 min to obtain the crude nuclear fraction as a pellet. The supernatant was spun again at 13,000 × g for 10 min to obtain the cytosol as supernatant. Rat brain cortex was lysed and incubated with buffers provided in a Qproteome nuclear protein kit (Qiagen, catalogue No. 37582). The manufacturer's protocol was followed to obtain cytosol, nucleic acid-binding proteins (NABP), and insoluble nuclear proteins (INP). Briefly, 50 mg of tissue was disrupted in a Dounce homogenizer in 1 ml of lysis buffer supplemented with protease inhibitor solution and 0.1 m DTT followed by incubation on ice for 15 min. 50 μl of detergent solution was added to the solution and vortexed for 10 s. Lysate was then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min to obtain cytosol as supernatant and pellet for nuclear subfractionation. The pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of extraction buffer NX1 supplemented with protease inhibitor solution and incubated for 30 min on a Rotamix at 4 °C. The suspension was spun down for 10 min at 12,000 × g to separate the NABP fraction as supernatant and INP in the pellet. The pellet was resuspended in extraction buffer NX2 supplemented with protease inhibitor, 0.1 m DTT, and Benzonase® nuclease followed by incubation for 1 h on a Rotamix at 4 °C. The suspension was centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 × g to obtain INP in the supernatant. The protein content of samples was assayed using Thermo Scientific Pierce® BCA protein assay reagent A (23228) and reagent B (1859078). 50 μg of each protein was mixed in NuPAGE® sample buffer (NP007) supplemented with 5% β-mercaptoethanol and boiled for 5 min. The boiled samples were separated on 4–12% bis-Tris-HCl gels (NuPAGE NP0335) in MES SDS running buffer (NuPAGE NP0002) and transferred to a 0.2-μm nitrocellulose membrane. After blocking in 5% skim milk in T-TBS (0.05% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.6) for 1 h, the membrane was incubated with primary antibody (CAPN5, 1:5000; CAPN2, 1:5000; SMN, 1:5000; histone H3, 1:5000; and β-tubulin, 1:10,000) in 5% skim milk in T-TBS overnight at 4 °C. The membrane was washed in T-TBS three times for 20 min each followed by incubation with an appropriate secondary antibody (anti-rabbit IgG, 1:5000, or anti-mouse IgG, 1:5000, linked to IRDye/Alexa Fluor-680 or IRDye 800) at room temperature for 1 h in dark conditions. The membrane was washed again three times for 20 min each and scanned using an Odyssey infrared imager (LI-COR Biosciences). To measure the intensity of bands on Western blots, Odyssey application software V3.0 (Image Studio) was used. A rectangle was drawn around the band of interest, with the rectangle size being constant for each lane of the blot. The relative densitometric value of the band was determined as compared with the background. Capn5tm1Dgen/J (Capn5+/−) male mice, ∼3 months of age, were perfused with PBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.4. The brains were removed, postfixed overnight, and then cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in PBS. The brains were frozen in powdered dry ice and sectioned at 40 μm in the coronal plane, with sections stored in cryoprotectant (30% ethylene glycol, v/v, and 30% glycerol, v/v, in 1× TBS) at −20 °C until use. Sections were rinsed three times in PBS then incubated with 1 mg/ml X-Gal in 10 mm potassium ferricyanide, 5 mm potassium ferrocyanide, 2 mm MgCl2 at 37 °C overnight or until the dark blue staining appeared. Following dehydration, clearing, and cover-slipping, sections were viewed and photographed using bright-field microscopy. Perfusion, fixation, and preparation of male rat brain sections were performed as discussed for β-galactosidase staining. Free-floating brains sections were washed three times in TBS followed by blocking in 5% natural goat serum (NGS) in T-TBS (0.1% Triton X-100) for 30 min at room temperature. Brain sections were incubated with primary antibodies (CAPN5, 1:100; NeuN, 1:200; GFAP, 1:1000; and APC, 1:100) in 5% NGS-T-TBS overnight at 4 °C. Primary antibody was omitted from the negative controls. Sections were washed three times in 1× TBS followed by a 1-h incubation with the appropriate secondary antibodies at 1:1000 dilution (Alexa Fluor-488 anti-rabbit IgG or Alexa Fluor-594 anti-mouse IgG) and then washed three times in TBS. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33258 at 10 μg/ml for 1 min. Brain sections were mounted on glass slides with Vectashield (H-1000, Vector Laboratories) florescence mounting medium and examined under a Leica AOBS TCS SP5 inverted laser scanning confocal microscope. SH-SY5Y (ATCC CRL-2266) cells were cultured in Eagle's minimum essential medium (ATCC 30-2003) plus 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 10% FBS at 37 °C in an incubator maintained with 95% air and 5% CO2. The cells were plated on 35-mm glass-bottom culture dishes. The following day, adherent cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.4, for 15 min at room temperature followed by permeabilization for 10 min with PBS containing 0.25% Triton X-100 (PBS/T). After washing three times with PBS, cells were incubated with 5% NGS-PBS/T for 30 min and then incubated with the primary antibody (PML, 1:100, or CAPN5, 1:100) in 5% NGS-PBS/T overnight at 4 °C. The next day, sections were washed three times in PBS and incubated for 1 h in the dark with 1:1000 Alexa Fluor-488 anti-rabbit IgG or Alexa Fluor-594 anti-mouse IgG followed by three more washes at 5 min each. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33258 at 10 μg/ml for 5 min. Cells were viewed under a Nikon Ti-E C2plus confocal microscope. Human CAPN5 cDNA (GenBankTM accession number BC018123.1) and oligonucleotides were purchased as described above under “Antibodies and Reagents.” PCR oligonucleotide primers for CAPN5 were designed to allow cloning into pN1-ZsGreen1, pN1-mCherry, or p3X-CMV-14-FLAG vector, such that ZsGreen1, mCherry, or a FLAG tag was encoded at the C terminus of the fusion protein. PCR was carried out using a Pfu DNA polymerase kit. The resulting DNA product was digested with EcoRI-HF and BamHI-HF. The product was then ligated into the vector using a Rapid DNA ligation kit and transformed into One Shot® Stbl3TM-competent bacteria. Plasmid DNA was isolated using the Qiagen Maxi Prep Kit 12263. Primers for mutagenesis were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, and mutations were introduced using the GeneArt® site-directed mutagenesis system (Invitrogen, catalogue No. 13282). For transient transfections, SH-SY5Y cells were grown in 35-mm glass-bottom culture dishes. At ∼70% confluency, cells were transfected with 0.2 μg of plasmid vector using Lipofectamine 2000 CD reagent. Transfected cells were imaged at 24 h post-transfection. Prior to imaging, cells were stained for 1 h with 10 μg/ml Hoechst 33258. Images were acquired on a Nikon Ti-E C2plus confocal microscope. The quantified values of the relative intensity of the CAPN5 immunoreactivity band and quantitative RT-PCR RQ data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's multiple comparison tests. CAPN5 is present in the CNS (17Waghray A. Wang D.S. McKinsey D. Hayes R.L. Wang K.K. Molecular cloning and characterization of rat and human calpain-5.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 324: 46-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), but its expression relative to other calpains is unknown. Using the real-time comparative CT method (ΔΔCT) (25Schmittgen T.D. Livak K.J. Analyzing real-time PCR data by the comparative C(T) method.Nat. Protoc. 2008; 3: 1101-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (17280) Google Scholar), we analyzed the average relative mRNA expression of several ubiquitous calpains (CAPN1, -2, -5, -7, and -10) in the adult rat brain (n = 4). Capn2 had the highest levels of mRNA expression, exceeding that of Capn5 by 2.7-fold. Capn5 was the second most highly expressed calpain in the brain followed by Capn7, -10, and -1, respectively (Fig. 1). For the immunodetection of CAPN5, we utilized rabbit polyclonal Ab28280 (Abcam), which was raised against the N-terminal 30 amino acids of human CAPN5. On Western blots of rat brain homogenate, the antibody detected a prominent band of ∼75 kDa. The antibody did not detect purified rat CAPN2 (Calbiochem catalogue No. 208718), and preincubation of the antibody with the immunogen peptide abolished the 75-kDa band on Western blots (Fig. 2, A and B). The antibody also detected a band of ∼75 KDa from SH-SY5Y cells expressing full-length human CAPN5 fused with a FLAG tag on the C terminus (Fig. 2C). A second commercial antibody against CAPN5 cross-reacted with CAPN2 (results not shown). To examine the cellular localization of Capn5 mRNA expression, we first utilized Capn5tm1Dgen/J mice in which a LacZ-Neo555G cassette was inserted into the calpain 5 gene. Capn5−/− mice were embryonically lethal, whereas Capn5+/− mice were viable. Despite the lower gene dosage, CAPN5 protein levels were unchanged in the brains of Capn5+/− mice as compared with the wild type (results not shown). In Capn5+/− mouse brain, X-Gal staining was prevalent in the pyramidal neurons in the hippocampal formation as well as in dentate granule and hilar neurons (Fig. 3A). X-Gal staining was also observed in molecular layers and white matter, indicative of expression in non-neuronal cells including astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. These results are consistent with Capn5 being ubiquitously expressed in all cells. In double-label immunocytochemistry, co-localization of CAPN5 immunoreactivity with anti-NeuN confirmed the neuronal localization of CAPN5, also indicating that expression was predominantly nuclear (Fig. 3B). Double labeling of anti-CAPN5 with anti-GFAP and anti-APC demonstrated nuclear CAPN5 expression in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes (Fig. 3, C and D). However, localization was not exclusively nuclear, as faint immunoreactivity was observed in the neuropil, and a band of CAPN5 immunoreactivity was present in the stratum lacunosum-moleculare in the hippocampal formation (not shown). This is a terminal zone of the perforant path and is rich in mitochondria (26Kageyama G.H. Wong-Riley M.T. Histochemical localization of cytochrome oxidase in the hippocampus: correlation with specific neuronal types and afferent pathways.Neuroscience. 1982; 7: 2337-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), suggesting a possible presynaptic, postsynaptic, or mitochondrial localization of CAPN5 in addition to the nuclear localization. To further evaluate the subcellular localization of CAPN5, rat brain cortices were homogenized and separated into cytosolic and crude nuclear fractions. CAPN5 immunoreactivity was abundant in the crude nuclear fraction but was not detected in the cytosolic fraction (Fig. 4A). Additional subfractionation demonstrated that CAPN5 was enriched in the NABP fraction (Fig. 4, B and C). Unlike findings in classical calpains, which are characterized as being mainly cytosolic (2Goll D.E. Thompson V.F. Li H. Wei W. Cong J. The calpain system.Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 731-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2356) Google Scholar, 27Yoshimura N. Hatanaka M. Kitahara A. Kawaguchi N. Murachi T.

Structure, activation, and biology of calpain.Diabetes. 2004; 53: S12-S18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), these results illustrate that CAPN5 is predominantly a non-cytosolic calpain, present in the nucleus in the nucleic acid-binding protein fraction. The nuclear staining observed with CAPN5 appeared punctate in each of the cell types examined in rat brain (Fig. 4D). Faint nuclear CAPN5 immunoreactivity was also detected outside of the punctate localization. Perinuclear and extranuclear immunoreactivity was also observed. Punctate nuclear localization was also observed in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells (Fig. 5), suggesting that CAPN5 is associated with one or more nuclear bodies (29Dundr M. Nuclear bodies: multifunctional companions of the genome.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2012; 24: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Non-nuclear, particularly perinuclear, CAPN5 immunoreactivity was also evident (Fig. 5). In SH-SY5Y cells transfected with a plasmid expressing full-length human CAPN5 fused with ZsGreen1 (pN1-CAPN51–640-ZsGreen1), similar punctate nuclear localization was observed with the CAPN5-ZsGreen1 fusion protein (Fig. 5). In several cells, there were also cytoplasmic aggregates of CAPN5 in the perinuclear region (Fig. 5). Dot-like nuclear expression of CAPN5 was also observed following transient transfection of SH-SY5Y cells with a vector encoding human CAPN5 with a C-terminal FLAG tag, as detected with an anti-FLAG antibody (Agilent Technologies, 200472) (result not shown). Endogenous as well as the transiently expressed CAPN5 nuclear dots were co-localized or closely associated with PML bodies, as detected using an antibody against PML protein (Fig. 5). PML-independent CAPN5 dots were also evident. Analysis of the primary sequence of human CAPN5 with a motif-scanning tool (30Pagni M. Ioannidis V. Cerutti L. Zahn-Zabal M. Jongeneel C.V. Hau J.

https://openalex.org/W2331229900,"Background Protein kinase D (PKD) enzymes regulate cofilin-driven actin reorganization and directed cell migration through both p21-activated kinase 4 (PAK4) and the phosphatase slingshot 1L (SSH1L). The relative contributions of different endogenous PKD isoforms to both signaling pathways have not been elucidated, sufficiently. Methodology/Principal Findings We here analyzed two cell lines (HeLa and MDA-MB-468) that express the subtypes protein kinase D2 (PKD2) and protein kinase D3 (PKD3). We show that under normal growth conditions both isoforms can form a complex, in which PKD3 is basally-active and PKD2 is inactive. Basal activity of PKD3 mediates PAK4 activity and downstream signaling, but does not significantly inhibit SSH1L. This signaling constellation was required for facilitating directed cell migration. Activation of PKD2 and further increase of PKD3 activity leads to additional phosphorylation and inhibition of endogenous SSH1L. Net effect is a dramatic increase in phospho-cofilin and a decrease in cell migration, since now both PAK4 and SSH1L are regulated by the active PKD2/PKD3 complex. Conclusions/Significance Our data suggest that PKD complexes provide an interface for both cofilin regulatory pathways. Dependent on the activity of involved PKD enzymes signaling can be balanced to guarantee a functional cofilin activity cycle and increase cell migration, or imbalanced to decrease cell migration. Our data also provide an explanation of how PKD isoforms mediate different effects on directed cell migration."
https://openalex.org/W2049124129,"The importance of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) in the skeleton is well known. BMP2 is expressed in a variety of tissues during development, growth and healing. In this study we sought to better identify the role of tissue-specific BMP2 during post-natal growth and to determine if BMP2 knockout affects the ability of terminally differentiated cells to create high quality bone material. We targeted BMP2 knockout to two differentiated cell types known to express BMP2 during growth and healing, early-stage osteoblasts and their progeny (osterix promoted Cre) and vascular endothelial cells (vascular-endothelial-cadherin promoted Cre). Our objectives were to assess post-natal bone growth, structure and strength. We hypothesized that removal of BMP2 from osteogenic and vascular cells (separately) would result in smaller skeletons with inferior bone material properties. At 12 and 24 weeks of age the osteoblast knockout of BMP2 reduced body weight by 20%, but the vascular knockout had no effect. Analysis of bone in the tibia revealed reductions in cortical and cancellous bone size and volume in the osteoblast knockout, but not in the vascular endothelial knockout. Furthermore, forelimb strength testing revealed a 30% reduction in ultimate force at both 12 and 24 weeks in the osteoblast knockout of BMP2, but no change in the vascular endothelial knockout. Moreover, mechanical strength testing of femurs from osteoblast knockout mice demonstrated an increased Young's modulus (greater than 35%) but decreased post-yield displacement (greater than 50%) at both 12 and 24 weeks of age. In summary, the osteoblast knockout of BMP2 reduced bone size and altered mechanical properties at the whole-bone and material levels. Osteoblast-derived BMP2 has an important role in post-natal skeletal growth, structure and strength, while vascular endothelial-derived BMP2 does not."
https://openalex.org/W2084831778,"Emergent behavior that arises from a mass effect is one of the most striking aspects of collective animal groups. Investigating such behavior would be important in order to understand how individuals interact with their neighbors. Although there are many experiments that have used collective animals to investigate social learning or conflict between individuals and society such as that between a fish and a school, reports on mass effects are rare. In this study, we show that a swarm of soldier crabs could spontaneously enter a water pool, which are usually avoided, by forming densely populated part of a swarm at the edge of the water pool. Moreover, we show that the observed behavior can be explained by the model of collective behavior based on inherent noise that is individuals' different velocities in a directed group. Our results suggest that inherent noise, which is widely seen in collective animals, can contribute to formation and/or maintenance of a swarm and that the dense swarm can enter the pool by means of enhanced inherent noise."
https://openalex.org/W2029787265,"Background Before using any prediction rule oriented towards pulmonary embolism (PE), family physicians (FPs) should have some suspicion of this diagnosis. The diagnostic reasoning process leading to the suspicion of PE is not well described in primary care. Objective to explore the diagnostic reasoning of FPs when pulmonary embolism is suspected. Method Semi-structured qualitative interviews with 28 FPs. The regional hospital supplied data of all their cases of pulmonary embolism from June to November 2011. The patient's FP was identified where he/she had been the physician who had sent the patient to the emergency unit. The first consecutive 14 FPs who agreed to participate made up the first group. A second group was chosen using a purposeful sampling method. The topic guide focused on the circumstances leading to the suspicion of PE. A thematic analysis was performed, by three researchers, using a grounded theory coding paradigm. Results In the FPs' experience, the suspicion of pulmonary embolism arose out of four considerations: the absence of indicative clinical signs for diagnoses other than PE, a sudden change in the condition of the patient, a gut feeling that something was seriously wrong and an earlier failure to diagnose PE. The FPs interviewed did not use rules in their diagnostic process. Conclusion This study illustrated the diagnostic role of gut feelings in the specific context of suspected pulmonary embolism in primary care. The FPs used the sense of alarm as a tool to prevent the diagnostic error of missing a PE. The diagnostic accuracy of gut feelings has yet to be evaluated."
https://openalex.org/W2085105600,"Destruxin A is a mycotoxin that is secreted by entomopathogenic fungi which has a broad-spectrum insecticidal effect. Previous transcript and protein profiling analysis showed that destruxin A has significant effects on the expression of serine protease inhibitor genes (serpin-2, 4, 5) in the larvae of Plutella xylostella. In the current study, we aimed to understand the role of serpins under application of destruxin A. We obtained two full-length cDNA sequences of P. xylostella serpins, named serpin-4 and serpin-5, and cloned the serpin-2 gene whose full-length has already been published. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that these two serpin genes were highly clustered with other serpins associated with the immune response in other insects. The temporal and spatial expression of serpin-2, serpin-4 and serpin-5 were determined to be the highest in the fat body and hemolymph of 4th larval stage using qRT-PCR and western blot detection techniques. RNA interference (RNAi) mediated knockdown of P. xylostella serpin genes was carried out by microinjection of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). The expression levels of serpins decreased significantly after RNAi. Results showed that the depletion of serpins induced cecropins expression, increased phenoloxidase (PO) activity, body melanization and mortality in the larvae of P. xylostella under the same lethal concentration of destruxin A. The superimposed effects of serpins RNAi were similar with the destruxin A treatment upon mortality of P. xylostella larvae. We discovered for the first time that serpins play indispensable role in P. xylostella when challenged by destruxin A and deduced the possible function mechanism of destruxin A. Our findings are conducive to fully understanding the potential insecticidal mechanism of destruxin A and constitute a well-defined potential molecular target for novel insecticides."
https://openalex.org/W1998480694,"UDGb belongs to family 5 of the uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG) superfamily. Here, we report that family 5 UDGb from Thermus thermophilus HB8 is not only a uracil DNA glycosyase acting on G/U, T/U, C/U, and A/U base pairs, but also a hypoxanthine DNA glycosylase acting on G/I, T/I, and A/I base pairs and a xanthine DNA glycosylase acting on all double-stranded and single-stranded xanthine-containing DNA. Analysis of potentials of mean force indicates that the tendency of hypoxanthine base flipping follows the order of G/I > T/I, A/I > C/I, matching the trend of hypoxanthine DNA glycosylase activity observed in vitro. Genetic analysis indicates that family 5 UDGb can also act as an enzyme to remove uracil incorporated into DNA through the existence of dUTP in the nucleotide pool. Mutational analysis coupled with molecular modeling and molecular dynamics analysis reveals that although hydrogen bonding to O2 of uracil underlies the UDG activity in a dissociative fashion, Tth UDGb relies on multiple catalytic residues to facilitate its excision of hypoxanthine and xanthine. This study underscores the structural and functional diversity in the UDG superfamily."
https://openalex.org/W1964908320,"CHARGE syndrome is a rare human disorder caused by mutations in the gene encoding chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 7 (CHD7). Characteristics of CHARGE are varied and include developmental ear and hearing anomalies. Here we report a novel mouse model of CHD7 dysfunction, termed Looper. The Looper strain harbours a nonsense mutation (c.5690C>A, p.S1897X) within the Chd7 gene. Looper mice exhibit many of the clinical features of the human syndrome, consistent with previously reported CHARGE models, including growth retardation, facial asymmetry, vestibular defects, eye anomalies, hyperactivity, ossicle malformation, hearing loss and vestibular dysfunction. Looper mice display an otosclerosis-like fusion of the stapes footplate to the cochlear oval window and blepharoconjunctivitis but not coloboma. Looper mice are hyperactive and have vestibular dysfunction but do not display motor impairment."
https://openalex.org/W2073355614,"Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a progressive and fatal disease with no cure. Vascular remodeling in PH involves intraluminal growth of endothelial and smooth muscle cells, leading to obliterative vascular lesions. Cell growth in these lesions is quasi-neoplastic, with evidence of monoclonality, apoptosis resistance and cancer-like metabolic derangements. Herein we tested the effect of human interferon alpha 2b (IFNα), a pleiotropic cytokine and anti-cancer therapeutic, on the development and progression of PH in the rat SU5416/hypoxia (SUH) model and mouse hypoxia model of the disease. In both models IFNα attenuated the development of PH and reversed established PH as assessed by measuring right ventricular systolic pressure and right ventricular hypertrophy. The effect of IFNα was dependent on the type I interferon receptor (IFNAR) since mice lacking a subunit of the IFNAR were not protected by IFNα. Morphometric analysis of pulmonary aterioles from hypoxic mice or SUH rats showed that IFNα inhibited pulmonary vascular remodeling in both models and that IFNα reversed remodeling in SUH rats with established disease. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that IFNα decreased the number of PCNA and Tunel positive cells in the wall of pulmonary arterioles. In vitro, IFNα inhibited proliferation of human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells and as well as human pulmonary artery endothelial cell proliferation and apoptosis. Together these findings demonstrate that IFNα reverses established experimental PH and provide a rationale for further exploration of the use of IFNα and other immunotherpies in PH."
https://openalex.org/W1980917908,"Context PHEX or DMP1 mutations cause hypophosphatemic-rickets and altered energy metabolism. PHEX binds to DMP1-ASARM-motif to form a complex with α5β3 integrin that suppresses FGF23 expression. ASARM-peptides increase FGF23 by disrupting the PHEX-DMP1-Integrin complex. We used a 4.2 kDa peptide (SPR4) that binds to ASARM-peptide/motif to study the DMP1-PHEX interaction and to assess SPR4 for the treatment of energy metabolism defects in HYP and potentially other bone-mineral disorders. Design Subcutaneously transplanted osmotic pumps were used to infuse SPR4-peptide or vehicle (VE) into wild-type mice (WT) and HYP-mice (PHEX mutation) for 4 weeks. Results SPR4 partially corrected HYP mice hypophosphatemia and increased serum 1.25(OH)2D3. Serum FGF23 remained high and PTH was unaffected. WT-SPR4 mice developed hypophosphatemia and hypercalcemia with increased PTH, FGF23 and 1.25(OH)2D3. SPR4 increased GAPDH HYP-bone expression 60× and corrected HYP-mice hyperglycemia and hypoinsulinemia. HYP-VE serum uric-acid (UA) levels were reduced and SPR4 infusion suppressed UA levels in WT-mice but not HYP-mice. SPR4 altered leptin, adiponectin, and sympathetic-tone and increased the fat mass/weight ratio for HYP and WT mice. Expression of perlipin-2 a gene involved in obesity was reduced in HYP-VE and WT-SPR4 mice but increased in HYP-SPR4 mice. Also, increased expression of two genes that inhibit insulin-signaling, ENPP1 and ESP, occurred with HYP-VE mice. In contrast, SPR4 reduced expression of both ENPP1 and ESP in WT mice and suppressed ENPP1 in HYP mice. Increased expression of FAM20C and sclerostin occurred with HYP-VE mice. SPR4 suppressed expression of FAM20C and sclerostin in HYP and WT mice. Conclusions ASARM peptides and motifs are physiological substrates for PHEX and modulate osteocyte PHEX-DMP1-α5β3-integrin interactions and thereby FGF23 expression. These interactions also provide a nexus that regulates bone and energy metabolism. SPR4 suppression of sclerostin and/or sequestration of ASARM-peptides improves energy metabolism and may have utility for treating familial rickets, osteoporosis, obesity and diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2013604216,"Ingestion of ethanol (ETOH) during pregnancy induces grave abnormalities in developing fetal brain. We have previously reported that ETOH induces programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4), a critical regulator of cell growth, in cultured fetal cerebral cortical neurons (PCNs) and in the cerebral cortex in vivo and affect protein synthesis as observed in Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). However, the mechanism which activates PDCD4 in neuronal systems is unclear and understanding this regulation may provide a counteractive strategy to correct the protein synthesis associated developmental changes seen in FASD. The present study investigates the molecular mechanism by which ethanol regulates PDCD4 in cortical neuroblasts, the immediate precursor of neurons. ETOH treatment significantly increased PDCD4 protein and transcript expression in spontaneously immortalized rat brain neuroblasts. Since PDCD4 is regulated at both the post-translational and post-transcriptional level, we assessed ETOH’s effect on PDCD4 protein and mRNA stability. Chase experiments demonstrated that ETOH does not significantly impact either PDCD4 protein or mRNA stabilization. PDCD4 promoter-reporter assays confirmed that PDCD4 is transcriptionally regulated by ETOH in neuroblasts. Given a critical role of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β) signaling in regulating protein synthesis and neurotoxic mechanisms, we investigated the involvement of GSK-3β and showed that multifunctional GSK-3β was significantly activated in response to ETOH in neuroblasts. In addition, we found that ETOH-induced activation of PDCD4 was inhibited by pharmacologic blockade of GSK-3β using inhibitors, lithium chloride (LiCl) and SB-216763 or siRNA mediated silencing of GSK-3β. These results suggest that ethanol transcriptionally upregulates PDCD4 by enhancing GSK-3β signaling in cortical neuroblasts. Further, we demonstrate that canonical Wnt-3a/GSK-3β signaling is involved in regulating PDCD4 protein expression. Altogether, we provide evidence that GSK-3β/PDCD4 network may represent a critical modulatory point to manage the protein synthetic anomalies and growth aberrations of neural cells seen in FASD."
https://openalex.org/W2314568166,"The corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) type 1 receptor (CRF1R) for the 41-amino acid peptide CRF is a class B G protein-coupled receptor, which plays a key role in the response of our body to stressful stimuli and the maintenance of homeostasis by regulating neural and endocrine functions. CRF and related peptides, such as sauvagine, bind to the extracellular regions of CRF1R and activate the receptor. In contrast, small nonpeptide antagonists, which are effective against stress-related disorders, such as depression and anxiety, have been proposed to interact with the helical transmembrane domains (TMs) of CRF1R and allosterically antagonize peptide binding and receptor activation. Here, we aimed to elucidate the role of the third TM (TM3) in the molecular mechanisms underlying activation of CRF1R. TM3 was selected because its tilted orientation, relative to the membrane, allows its residues to establish key interactions with ligands, other TM helices, and the G protein. Using a combination of pharmacological, biochemical, and computational approaches, we found that Phe-2033.40 and Gly-2103.47 in TM3 play an important role in receptor activation.

Pin J.P. Molecular tinkering of G protein-coupled receptors: an evolutionary success.EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1723-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (1227) Google Scholar). They accomplish this by triggering a large number of cellular signaling cascades, through their cognate heterotrimeric G proteins, as a result of their interaction with a vast number of chemically divergent molecules ranging from light to large polypeptides (1Bockaert J.

Based on sequence similarity methods, the superfamily of GPCRs is classified into four families or classes (A, B, C, and smoothened), which display little sequence similarity and do not share common structural/functional motifs (3Nordström K.J. Lagerström M.C. Wallér L.M. Fredriksson R. Schiöth H.B. The secretin GPCRs descended from the family of adhesion GPCRs.Mol. Biol. Evol. 2009; 26: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Class A (or rhodopsin-like) is the largest family of GPCRs. Most of our understanding regarding the structure and function of GPCRs has been achieved in this family (4Katritch V. Cherezov V. Stevens R.C. Structure-function of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily.Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2013; 53: 531-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). Very recently the crystal structures of the type 1 receptor (CRF1R) for the 41-amino acid peptide, corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), and the glucagon receptor (GCGR), which belong to class B GPCRs, have been published (5Siu F.Y. He M. de Graaf C. Han G.W. Yang D. Zhang Z. Zhou C. Xu Q. Wacker D. Joseph J.S. Liu W. Lau J. Cherezov V. Katritch V. Wang M.W. Stevens R.C. Structure of the human glucagon class B G protein-coupled receptor.Nature. 2013; 499: 444-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 6Hollenstein K. Kean J. Bortolato A. Cheng R.K. Doré A.S.

Notably, despite their overall low sequence identity, structures from different families share a common molecular architecture and activate a similar pool of intracellular signaling molecules, the G proteins. This architecture is characterized by the presence of seven α-helical transmembrane domains (TMs) connected to each other by three extracellular (EL) and three intracellular loops. Moreover, all GPCRs possess an extracellular N-terminal region (N-domain) and a cytoplasmic C terminus, containing an α-helix (Hx8) oriented parallel to the cell membrane. These common features lead to the biologically important hypothesis that GPCR activation utilizes conserved structural elements leading to production of a biological effect. Although the crystal structure of a receptor provides the ultimate information for its structure, it represents a single snapshot of one conformational state. Specifically, the crystal structures of the apo-state of GCGR and the CRF1R in complex with the nonpeptide CRF antagonist CP-376395 represent the inactive states of truncated receptors, lacking their extracellular N-domain (5Siu F.Y. He M. de Graaf C. Han G.W. Yang D. Zhang Z. Zhou C. Xu Q. Wacker D. Joseph J.S. Liu W. Lau J. Cherezov V. Katritch V. Wang M.W. Stevens R.C.

Despite the fact that these truncated forms of class B GPCRs bound small nonpeptide ligands with similar affinities with those of the full-length receptors, they are not able to bind peptides and be activated because they lack the functionally indispensable N-domain (7Hoare S.R. Mechanisms of peptide and nonpeptide ligand binding to Class B G protein-coupled receptors.Drug. Discov. Today. 2005; 10: 417-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 8Perrin M.H. Sutton S.

The first extracellular domain of corticotropin releasing factor-R1 contains major binding determinants for urocortin and astressin.Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 566-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Thus, although crystallization of CRF1R or GCGR provided invaluable structural information for an inactive state of these receptors, the molecular mechanisms underlying receptor activation that convert ligand binding to a biological effect are still elusive. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the activation of CRF1R and to validate the hypothesis that activation of class A and B GPCRs utilizes conserved structural elements. We accomplished this by using a combination of different experimental approaches and by comparing the available results on the role of the third TM (TM3) in the structure-function of class A with the much less studied class B GPCRs. TM3 is a structural and functional hub as suggested by the comparison of class A crystal structures, in their inactive and active states (9Venkatakrishnan A.J. Deupi X. Lebon G. Tate C.G. Schertler G.F. Babu M.M. Molecular signatures of G protein-coupled receptors.Nature. 2013; 494: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). The residues in TM3 are functionally important by mediating interactions with the extracellular ligand, as well as by forming key inter-TM interactions that define the GPCR-fold, a conserved disulfide bridge with the second EL (EL2), and an important interface for G protein binding. We focused on the CRF1R, which plays a key role in the response of our body to stressful stimuli and the maintenance of homeostasis, by regulating neural and endocrine functions (6Hollenstein K. Kean J. Bortolato A. Cheng R.K. Doré A.S. Jazayeri A. Cooke R.M. Weir M. Marshall F.H.

Gkountelias K. Members of CRF family and their receptors: from past to future.Curr. Med. Chem. 2011; 18: 2583-2600Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Moreover, the TM3 of CRF1R has been shown to be involved in the binding of small ligand antagonists that are effective against stress-related disorders, such as depression and anxiety (6Hollenstein K. Kean J. Bortolato A. Cheng R.K. Doré A.S. Jazayeri A. Cooke R.M. Weir M. Marshall F.H.

All crystallized GPCRs (including 21 receptors, 18 of which belong to family A, two to family B, and one to family F) were structurally superimposed using MultiProt based on their Cβ atoms (11Shatsky M. Nussinov R. Wolfson H.J. A method for simultaneous alignment of multiple protein structures.Proteins. 2004; 56: 143-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). This permitted us to obtain a structurally based sequence alignment, which was later revised using Jalview (12Waterhouse A.M. Procter J.B. Martin D.M. Clamp M. Barton G.J. Jalview Version 2–a multiple sequence alignment editor and analysis workbench.Bioinformatics. 2009; 25: 1189-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (5682) Google Scholar). To study the TM3-TM5 interface of the unliganded state of CRF1R, a homology model based on the crystal structure of GCGR (Protein Data Bank code 4L6R) was built using MODELLER (5Siu F.Y.

Sali A. Comparative protein structure modeling of genes and genomes.Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 291-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (2559) Google Scholar). The primary sequence of human CRF1R was used (UniProt accession code P34998) in which the G2103.47C mutation was inserted. The highly conserved residues-motifs between family B (L1.42 in TM1, HXNL in TM2, W3.42 in TM3, GWGXP in TM4, N5.53 in TM5, PLLG in TM6, and G7.46 in TM7), were used as reference points in TM sequence alignments (supplemental Fig. S1). The N terminus of the receptor was disregarded. Residues are identified by the general numbering scheme of Ballesteros and Weinstein that allows easy comparison among residues in the 7TM segments of receptors belonging to different families. The cDNA sequences encoding wild-type CRF1R (WT) or ΔCys CRF1R(ΔCys) were subcloned into the bicistronic expression vector pcin4, thereby creating the vectors pcin4-WT or pcin4-ΔCys, respectively, as described previously (14Gkountelias K. Papadokostaki M. Javitch J.A. Liapakis G. Exploring the binding site crevice of a family B G protein-coupled receptor, the type 1 corticotropin releasing factor receptor.Mol. Pharmacol. 2010; 78: 785-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). ΔCys is a mutant CRF1R, which is insensitive to sulfhydryl-specific reagents and has similar functional properties with those of wild-type receptor (14Gkountelias K. Papadokostaki M. Javitch J.A. Liapakis G. Exploring the binding site crevice of a family B G protein-coupled receptor, the type 1 corticotropin releasing factor receptor.Mol. Pharmacol. 2010; 78: 785-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Mutations were generated by the polymerase chain reaction-mediated mutagenesis, using Pfu polymerase (MBI Fermentas, Hanover, MD) and mutagenic oligonucleotides encoding the desired amino acid substitution. The polymerase chain reaction generated DNA fragments containing Cys, Trp, Ala, Ile, or Lys mutations. The fragments containing the Cys mutations were subcloned into the pcin4-ΔCys plasmid (creating the pcin4-substituted Cys mutant plasmids), whereas those containing the other mutations were subcloned into the pcin4-WT plasmid (creating the pcin4-X mutant plasmids). The mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (1:1) containing 3.15 g/liter glucose and 10% bovine calf serum at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Sixty-millimeter dishes of HEK293 cells at 80–90% confluence were transfected with 2–3 μg of pcin4-WT (WT), pcin4-ΔCys (ΔCys), pcin4-X mutant (X mutants), or pcin4-substituted Cys mutant (substituted Cys mutants) plasmids using 9 μl of Lipofectamine and 2.5 ml of Opti-MEM (both from Invitrogen). To generate stably transfected pools of cells expressing the receptors 5–12 h after transfection, the medium was replaced by Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (1:1) containing 3.15 g/liter glucose, 10% bovine calf serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT), and 700 μg/ml G418 (Geneticin), an antibiotic (Invitrogen). The antibiotic was added to select a stably transfected pool of cells. Cells expressing WT, ΔCys, or mutants, at 100% confluence in 60- or 100-mm dishes, were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (4.3 mm Na2HPO4·7H2O, 1.4 mm KH2PO4, 137 mm NaCl, and 2.7 mm KCl, pH 7.3–7.4, at 37 °C), briefly treated with PBS containing 2 mm EDTA (PBS/EDTA), and then dissociated in PBS/EDTA. Cells suspensions were centrifuged at 50 × g for 2 min at room temperature, and the pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of buffer M (25 mm HEPES containing 5.4 mm KCl, 140 mm NaCl, and 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.2, at 22–25 °C) for treatment with methanethiosulfonate reagents or in 1.5 ml of buffer H (20 mm HEPES, containing 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 0.2 mg/ml bacitracin, and 0.93 μg/ml aprotinin, pH 7.2, at 4 °C) for binding assays. For radioligand binding assays, cell suspensions (1.5 ml) in buffer H were homogenized using an Ultra-Turrax T25 homogenizer (IKA Janke and Kunkel, Staufen, Germany) at setting ∼20 for 10–15 s, at 4 °C. The homogenates were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the membrane pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of buffer B (buffer H containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.2, at 20 °C). The membrane suspensions were diluted in buffer B and used for homologous or heterologous competition binding studies as described previously (15Gkountelias K. Tselios T. Venihaki M. Deraos G. Lazaridis I. Rassouli O. Gravanis A. Liapakis G. Alanine scanning mutagenesis of the second extracellular loop of type 1 corticotropin-releasing factor receptor revealed residues critical for peptide binding.Mol. Pharmacol. 2009; 75: 793-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In brief, aliquots of diluted membrane suspensions (50 μl) were added into low retention tubes (Kisker-Biotech, Steinfurt, Germany), containing buffer B and 20–50 pm 125I-Tyr0-sauvagine with or without increasing concentrations of Tyr0-sauvagine (homologous competition binding), sauvagine, astressin, or antalarmin (heterologous competition binding) (American Peptide Co., Sunnyvale, CA). The mixtures were incubated at 20–21 °C for 120 min and then filtered using a Brandel cell harvester through Whatman 934AH glass fiber filters presoaked for 1 h in 0.3% polyethyleneimine at 4 °C. The filters were washed three times with 0.5 ml of ice-cold PBS, pH 7.1, containing 0.01% Triton X-100. Filters were assessed for radioactivity in a gamma counter (1275 minigamma, 80% efficiency; LKB Wallac, Chalfont St. Giles, Buckinghamshire, UK). The amount of membrane used was adjusted to ensure that the specific binding was always equal to or less than 10% of the total concentration of the added radioligand. Specific 125I-Tyr0-sauvagine binding was defined as total binding less nonspecific binding in the presence of 1000 nm sauvagine or antalarmin. Data for competition binding were analyzed by nonlinear regression analysis, using Prism 4.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego). IC50 values were obtained by fitting the data from competition studies to a one-site competition model. The logKi values for astressin and antalarmin and the logKD values for 125I-Tyr0-sauvagine binding were determined from heterologous and homologous competition data, respectively, as described previously using Prism 4.0 (15Gkountelias K.

Pharmacol. 2009; 75: 793-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). For treatment with MTSEA, aliquots (0.1 ml) of suspensions (in buffer M) of cells expressing ΔCys or substituted Cys mutants were incubated without or with 2.5 mm MTSEA for 15 s at 22–25 °C. Cell suspensions were then diluted 140-fold in buffer PBS/EDTA, pH 7.1, at 22–25 °C containing 10 mm MgCl2 and centrifuged at 250 × g for 10 min at 22–25 °C, and the pellets were resuspended in 1.5 ml of buffer M containing 10 mm MgCl2. Cell suspensions were centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min at 22–25 °C, and the pellets were homogenized in 1.5 ml of buffer H, as described above. The homogenates were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the membrane pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of buffer B (buffer H containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.2, at 20 °C). The membrane suspensions were used to assay for 125I-Tyr0-sauvagine binding as described above. Inhibition of binding was calculated as 1 − (specific binding after MTSEA/specific binding without MTSEA). Protection experiments were performed by preincubation of aliquots of cell suspensions with astressin (1 μm), Tyr0-sauvagine (1 μm), or α-helical (9–41) CRF (1 μm) for 60 min at 20 °C in buffer M. Subsequently, the mixtures (0.1 ml) were treated with 2.5 mm MTSEA as described above. Cells were treated and homogenized as described above, and homogenates were used to assay for 125I-Tyr0-sauvagine binding. HEK293 cells stably expressing WT, ΔCys, or mutants were plated in 96-well cell culture plates (pretreated with 0.1 mg/ml poly-l-lysine). After incubation overnight at 37 °C in 5% CO2, the cells were 95–100% confluent. The medium was removed, and 100 μl of assay buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm choline, 288 mm sucrose, 0.9 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine) was added. After 1 h of incubation at 37 °C, more assay buffer without (basal levels) or with increasing concentrations of sauvagine in the presence or absence of 0.3 μm astressin or 1–2 μm antalarmin was added to a total volume of 200 μl, and the incubation was continued for 30 min at 37 °C. At the end of the incubation, the assay buffer was removed. The cells were placed on ice and lysed with 3% trichloroacetic acid. Lysates were incubated on ice for 30–60 min and stored at −20 °C. After 1–5 days, frozen lysates were thawed and centrifuged at 1800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were neutralized with 2 n NaOH. Quantification of cAMP in the neutralized supernatants was performed using a competitive binding assay as described previously (15Gkountelias K. Tselios T. Venihaki M. Deraos G. Lazaridis I.

In brief, supernatants were transferred to polypropylene mini-tubes (20 μl/tube) containing buffer A (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, and 5 mm EDTA) with 1–1.5 nm [2,8-3H]cAMP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Subsequently, cAMP-binding protein (∼100 mg of crude bovine adrenal cortex extract in 500 ml of buffer A) was added to each tube. After incubation on ice for 3 h, the mixtures were filtered through Whatman 934AH glass fiber filters as described for radioligand binding assays, using buffer C (120 mm NaCl and 10 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.4, at 4 °C) as washing buffer. The amount of cAMP in each sample (one-tenth of a well) was determined by comparison with a standard curve of known concentrations of unlabeled cAMP (1–100 pmol/tube). The logEC50 values were obtained by fitting the data to a one-site sigmoidal model using nonlinear regression analysis (Prism 4.0). Fig. 1A shows the superimposition of the helical TMs of representative members of the currently available crystal structures of GPCRs in the inactive conformation. The structure of the cytoplasmic part of TMs is highly conserved, whereas the structure of their extracellular part is more divergent. This suggests that each receptor family has adjusted specific structural characteristics for selective ligand binding that triggers a conserved set of conformational rearrangements of the helices near the G protein binding domains. The publication of the structures of the ligand-free opsin, the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2-AR) bound to agonists and the β2-AR bound to Gs have shown the intracellular structural changes associated with activation of class A GPCRs (16Park J.H.

To compare these mechanisms with class B GPCRs, Fig. 1B shows a structure-based sequence alignment of all available crystal structures of GPCRs, and supplemental Fig. S1 shows the amino acid conservation, at structurally homologous positions, within classes A and B. This alignment compares the highly conserved amino acids in class A, used by Ballesteros and Weinstein to define a general numbering scheme for class A GPCRs, with class B (19Ballesteros J. Weinstein H. Integrated methods for the construction of three-dimensional models of structure-function relations in G protein-coupled receptors.Methods Neurosci. 1995; 25: 366-428Crossref Scopus (2465) Google Scholar). Class B includes both the adhesion and secretin subfamilies, as the latter is a descendant from the adhesion subfamily (3Nordström K.J. Lagerström M.C. Wallér L.M. Fredriksson R. Schiöth H.B. The secretin GPCRs descended from the family of adhesion GPCRs.Mol. Biol. Evol. 2009; 26: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In particular, TM3 contains the conserved Cys3.25 engaged in a disulfide bond with a conserved Cys in EL2. The positional equivalent of the highly conserved (D/E)R3.50Y motif in class A corresponds to (Y/H)L3.50(Y/H) in class B. Because of the spatial conservation of the TM amino acids between classes A and B, the Ballesteros-Weinstein nomenclature is used throughout. To identify the TM3 residues that are located on the water-accessible binding site crevice of the inactive apo-state of the full-length CRF1R, we mutated each amino acid, one at a time, to Cys (engineered Cys) and determined their accessibilities by applying SCAM (20Javitch J.A. Shi L. Liapakis G. Use of the substituted cysteine accessibility method to study the structure and function of G protein-coupled receptors.Methods Enzymol. 2002; 343: 137-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). SCAM is based on the ability of the positively charged MTSEA, to react with the free sulfhydryl group of a cysteine (supplemental Fig. S2). We detected the MTSEA reaction by determining its ability to inhibit the binding of the radiolabeled CRF analog, 125I-Tyr0-sauvagine, to the receptor. We used an MTSEA-insensitive CRF1R mutant (ΔCys), which has a wild-type pharmacological profile and has been created by replacing five endogenous Cys by Ser (14Gkountelias K. Papadokostaki M. Javitch J.A. Liapakis G. Exploring the binding site crevice of a family B G protein-coupled receptor, the type 1 corticotropin releasing factor receptor.Mol. Pharmacol. 2010; 78: 785-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Among the 22 TM3 engineered Cys (ΔCys + R1893.26C to ΔCys + G2103.47C), those at positions 1893.26, 1923.29, 1933.30, 1953.32, 1963.33, and 1993.36 reacted with MTSEA because the reaction significantly reduced the binding of 125I-Tyr0-sauvagine to these Cys-substituted mutants (Fig. 2A). Given that in the absence of MTSEA, the R1893.26C, T1923.29C, A1933.30C, Y1953.32C, N1963.33C, and H1993.36C substitutions did not significantly alter 125I-Tyr0-sauvagine affinity (Fig. 2B) and thus the overall conformation of receptor, we infer that these TM3 residues are located on the binding site crevice of CRF1R. This is consistent with the recent crystal structures of CRF1R and GCGR (5Siu F.Y. He M. de Graaf C. Han G.W. Yang D. Zhang Z. Zhou C. Xu Q. Wacker D. Joseph J.S. Liu W. Lau J. Cherezov V.

Similarly, the ΔCys + F2033.40C mutant reacted with MTSEA, because the reaction significantly altered 125I-Tyr0-sauvagine binding. Surprisingly, in contrast to the other positive TM3 Cys mutants, MTSEA reaction with ΔCys + F2033.40C increased binding (Fig. 2A). Notably, the potentiation of radioligand binding to ΔCys + F2033.40C by MTSEA was significantly decreased after pretreatment of cells expressing this mutant with 1 μm astressin, but not with α-helical (9–41) CRF or Tyr0-sauvagine (at concentrations of 1μm) (Fig. 3A). We infer that F2033.40 is also located on the binding site crevice of CRF1R, given that this TM3 residue interacts with small nonpeptide antagonists, such as antalarmin, as suggested by our results (Fig. 3B) and by the crystal structure of CRF1R (6Hollenstein K. Kean J. Bortolato A. Cheng R.K. Doré A.S. Jazayeri A. Cooke R.M. Weir M. Marshall F.H. Structure of class B GPCR corticotropin-releasing factor receptor 1.Nature. 2013; 499: 438-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). The hydrophobic antalarmin, even at the high concentration of 1 μm, failed to antagonize sauvagine binding to ΔCys after mutation of the hydrophobic F2033.40 to the hydrophilic Cys, regardless of the presence of MTSEA (Fig. 3B). In marked contrast, the binding affinity of astressin was not affected by the F2033.40C mutation even in the presence of MTSEA (Fig. 3C). Astressin is a CRF peptide antagonist that is less sensitive to receptor activation-associated conformational changes than agonists, and it interacts with the extracellular N-domain of CRF1R (8Perrin M.H.

Antibacterial activity was measured for each compound by determining the minimum inhibitory concentration against the bacteria, and the toxicity towards mammalian cells was determined. The most effective compound, THAM trisphenylguanide, was studied in time-to-kill and cytoplasmic leakage assays against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA, USA300) in comparison to chlorhexidine. Preliminary toxicity and MRSA challenge studies in mice were also conducted on this compound. THAM trisphenylguanide showed significant antibacterial activity (MIC ∼1 mg/L) and selectivity against MRSA relative to all the other bacteria examined. In time-to-kill assays it showed increased antimicrobial activity against MRSA versus chlorhexidine. It induced leakage of cytoplasmic content at concentrations that did not reduce cell viability, suggesting the mechanism of action may involve membrane disruption. Using an intraperitoneal mouse model of invasive MRSA disease, THAM trisphenylguanide reduced bacterial burden locally and in deeper tissues. This study has identified a novel guanide compound with selective microbicidal activity against Staphylococcus aureus, including a methicillin-resistant (MRSA) strain."
https://openalex.org/W1972512867,"Bioluminescence imaging assays have become a widely integrated technique to quantify effectiveness of cell-based therapies by monitoring fate and survival of transplanted cells. To date these assays are still largely qualitative and often erroneous due to the complexity and dynamics of local micro-environments (niches) in which the cells reside. Here, we report, using a combined experimental and computational approach, on oxygen that besides being a critical niche component responsible for cellular energy metabolism and cell-fate commitment, also serves a primary role in regulating bioluminescent light kinetics. We demonstrate the potential of an oxygen dependent Michaelis-Menten relation in quantifying intrinsic bioluminescence intensities by resolving cell-associated oxygen gradients from bioluminescent light that is emitted from three-dimensional (3D) cell-seeded hydrogels. Furthermore, the experimental and computational data indicate a strong causal relation of oxygen concentration with emitted bioluminescence intensities. Altogether our approach demonstrates the importance of oxygen to evolve towards quantitative bioluminescence and holds great potential for future microscale measurement of oxygen tension in an easily accessible manner."

The NaCl CT response was enhanced at -60 mV and suppressed at +60 mV. In every case the CT response (r) versus voltage (V) curve was linear. All ENaC activators increased the open-circuit response (ro) and the voltage sensitivity (κ, negative of the slope of the r versus V curve) and ionomycin+Ca2+ decreased ro and κ to zero. Compound 1 and Compound 2 expressed a sigmoidal-saturating function of concentration (0.25-1 mM) with a half-maximal response concentration (k) of 0.49 and 1.05 mM, respectively. Following treatment with 1 mM Compound 1, 8-CPT-cAMP, BAPTA-AM and pH 10.3, the Bz-sensitive NaCl CT response to 100 mM NaCl was enhanced and was equivalent to the Bz-sensitive CT response to 300 mM NaCl. Plots of κ versus ro in the absence and presence of the activators or the inhibitor were linear, suggesting that changes in the affinity of Na+ for ENaC under different conditions are fully compensated by changes in the apical membrane potential difference, and that the observed changes in the Bz-sensitive NaCl CT response arise exclusively from changes in the maximum CT response (rm). The results further suggest that the agonists enhance and ionomycin+Ca2+ decreases ENaC function by increasing or decreasing the rate of release of Na+ from its ENaC binding site to the receptor cell cytosol, respectively. Irrespective of agonist type, the Bz-sensitive NaCl CT response demonstrated a maximum response enhancement limit of about 75% over control value."
https://openalex.org/W2057800268,Babesia bovis is a tick-borne intraerythocytic protozoan responsible for acute disease in cattle which can be controlled by vaccination with attenuated B. bovis strains. Emerging B. bovis transfection technologies may increase the usefulness of these live vaccines. One use of transfected B. bovis parasites may be as a vaccine delivery platform. Previous transfection methods for B. bovis were limited by single expression sites and intracellular expression of transfected antigens. This study describes a novel transfection system in which two exogenous genes are expressed: one for selection and the other for a selected antigen designed to be delivered to the surface of the parasites. The strategy for duplicating the number of transfected genes was based on the use of the putative bidirectional promoter of the B. bovis 1.4 Kb ef-1α intergenic region. The ability of this region to regulate two independent expression sites was demonstrated using a luciferase assay on transiently transfected B. bovis parasites and then incorporated into a stable transfection plasmid to control independent expression of the selectable marker GFP-BSD and another gene of interest. A chimeric gene was synthetized using sequences from the protective B-cell epitopes of Rhipicephalus microplus tick antigen Bm86 along with sequences from the surface exposed B. bovis major surface antigen-1. This chimeric gene was then cloned into the additional expression site of the transfection plasmid. Transfection of the B. bovis Mo7 strain with this plasmid resulted in stable insertion into the ef-1α locus and simultaneous expression of both exogenous genes. Expression of the Bm86 epitopes on the surface of transfected merozoites was demonstrated using immunofluorescence analyses. The ability to independently express multiple genes by the inclusion of a bidirectional promoter and the achievement of surface expression of foreign epitopes advances the potential of transfected B. bovis as a future vaccine delivery platform.

The more objective ventilator-associated complications (VAC) are increasingly used for quality reporting. It is unknown if delays in antimicrobial administration, after patients meet VAC criteria, leads to worse outcomes. Materials and Methods Cohort of 81 episodes of antimicrobial treatment for VAP. We compared mortality, superinfections and treatment failures conditional on the timing of identification of VAC. Results 60% of patients with VAC had an identifiable episode at least 48 before the initiation of antimicrobials. Antimicrobial administration after the identification of VAC was not associated with intensive care unit (ICU) mortality (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.11–4.48, p = 0.701) compared to immediate antimicrobial administration. Similarly, the risk of treatment failure or superinfection was not affected by the timing of administration of antimicrobials in VAC (HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.42–2.19, p = 0.914). Conclusions We observed no signal of harm associated with the timing to initiate antimicrobials after the identification of a VAC. The identification of VAC should not lead clinicians to start antimicrobials before a diagnosis of VAP can be established."
https://openalex.org/W2084060515,"Aims Long-term urodynamics are required because bladder-emptying disorders are often not clearly revealed by conventional urodynamics. Patients with severe clinical overactive bladder symptoms, for instance, often show normal results. This may be due to the short evaluation time and psychological factors that complicate conventional urodynamics. This study aimed to develop an ambulatory three-component urodynamic measurement system that is easy to operate, registers urodynamic parameters for several days, and has no negative impact on the patient. Methods We developed an intravesical capsule combined with a hand-held device to register voiding desire and micturition, and an alarm pad device that detects urine loss. Recently, the intravesical capsule and its proven function were detailed in the literature. Here, we present detailed in vitro results using a female bladder model. The flexible capsule was C-shaped to minimize the risk of expulsion from the bladder during micturition. Results of biocompatibility evaluation of the intravesical capsule, which is called Wille Capsule (WiCa) are described. Results The WiCa with an oval nose and a maximum outer diameter of 5.5 mm was easily inserted through a 25-French cystoscope. Removing the WiCa by grasping the nose using the female model with bladder was easily conducted. Expulsion of the WiCa during voiding was avoided through a novel C-shaped device design. Based on in vitro cytotoxicity studies, the capsule is a promising and safe device. Conclusion Our novel system is an innovative minimally-invasive tool for accurate long-term urodynamic measurement, and does not require inserting a transurethral catheter."

The exact conditional approach is guaranteed to respect the test size as compared to the traditionally used asymptotic approach based on the standardized Cohen's kappa coefficient. An alternative to the conditional approach is an unconditional strategy which relaxes the restriction of fixed marginal totals as in the conditional approach. Three exact unconditional hypothesis testing procedures are considered in this article: an approach based on maximization, an approach based on the conditional p-value and maximization, and an approach based on estimation and maximization. We compared these testing procedures based on the commonly used Cohen's kappa with regards to test size and power.

https://openalex.org/W2016560430,"Mutations in the ABCC6 ABC-transporter are causative of pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE). The loss of functional ABCC6 protein in the basolateral membrane of the kidney and liver is putatively associated with altered secretion of a circulatory factor. As a result, systemic changes in elastic tissues are caused by progressive mineralization and degradation of elastic fibers. Premature arteriosclerosis, loss of skin and vascular tone, and a progressive loss of vision result from this ectopic mineralization. However, the identity of the circulatory factor and the specific role of ABCC6 in disease pathophysiology are not known. Though recessive loss-of-function alleles are associated with alterations in ABCC6 expression and function, the molecular pathologies associated with the majority of PXE-causing mutations are also not known. Sequence analysis of orthologous ABCC6 proteins indicates the C-terminal sequences are highly conserved and share high similarity to the PDZ sequences found in other ABCC subfamily members. Genetic testing of PXE patients suggests that at least one disease-causing mutation is located in a PDZ-like sequence at the extreme C-terminus of the ABCC6 protein. To evaluate the role of this C-terminal sequence in the biosynthesis and trafficking of ABCC6, a series of mutations were utilized to probe changes in ABCC6 biosynthesis, membrane stability and turnover. Removal of this PDZ-like sequence resulted in decreased steady-state ABCC6 levels, decreased cell surface expression and stability, and mislocalization of the ABCC6 protein in polarized cells. These data suggest that the conserved, PDZ-like sequence promotes the proper biosynthesis and trafficking of the ABCC6 protein."
https://openalex.org/W2029205064,"Vertebrates evolved an endothelium-lined hemostatic system and a pump-driven pressurized circulation with a finely-balanced coagulation cascade and elaborate blood pressure control over the past 500 million years. Genome analyses have identified principal components of the ancestral coagulation system, however, how this complex trait was originally regulated is largely unknown. Likewise, little is known about the roots of blood pressure control in vertebrates. Here we studied three members of the serpin superfamily that interfere with procoagulant activity and blood pressure of lampreys, a group of basal vertebrates. Angiotensinogen from these jawless fish was found to fulfill a dual role by operating as a highly selective thrombin inhibitor that is activated by heparin-related glycosaminoglycans, and concurrently by serving as source of effector peptides that activate type 1 angiotensin receptors. Lampreys, uniquely among vertebrates, thus use angiotensinogen for interference with both coagulation and osmo- and pressure regulation. Heparin cofactor II from lampreys, in contrast to its paralogue angiotensinogen, is preferentially activated by dermatan sulfate, suggesting that these two serpins affect different facets of thrombin’s multiple roles. Lampreys also express a lineage-specific serpin with anti-factor Xa activity, which demonstrates that another important procoagulant enzyme is under inhibitory control. Comparative genomics suggests that orthologues of these three serpins were key components of the ancestral hemostatic system. It appears that, early in vertebrate evolution, coagulation and osmo- and pressure regulation crosstalked through antiproteolytically active angiotensinogen, a feature that was lost during vertebrate radiation, though in gnathostomes interplay between these traits is effective."
https://openalex.org/W2030122845,"With the blooming of online social media applications, Community Question Answering (CQA) services have become one of the most important online resources for information and knowledge seekers. A large number of high quality question and answer pairs have been accumulated, which allow users to not only share their knowledge with others, but also interact with each other. Accordingly, volumes of efforts have been taken to explore the questions and answers retrieval in CQA services so as to help users to finding the similar questions or the right answers. However, to our knowledge, less attention has been paid so far to question popularity in CQA. Question popularity can reflect the attention and interest of users. Hence, predicting question popularity can better capture the users’ interest so as to improve the users’ experience. Meanwhile, it can also promote the development of the community. In this paper, we investigate the problem of predicting question popularity in CQA. We first explore the factors that have impact on question popularity by employing statistical analysis. We then propose a supervised machine learning approach to model these factors for question popularity prediction. The experimental results show that our proposed approach can effectively distinguish the popular questions from unpopular ones in the Yahoo! Answers question and answer repository."
https://openalex.org/W2042653597,"Integrins are the major cell adhesion molecules responsible for cell attachment to the extracellular matrix. The strength of integrin-mediated adhesion is controlled by the affinity of individual integrins (integrin activation) as well as by the number of integrins involved in such adhesion. The positive correlation between integrin activation and integrin clustering had been suggested previously, but several trials to induce integrin clustering by dimerization of the transmembrane domain or tail region of integrin α subunits failed to demonstrate any change in integrin activation. Here, using platelet integrin αIIbβ3 as a model system, we showed that there is intermolecular lateral interaction between integrins through the transmembrane domains, and this interaction can enhance the affinity state of integrins. In addition, when integrin clustering was induced through heteromeric lateral interactions using bimolecular fluorescence complementation, we could observe a significant increase in the number of active integrin molecules. Because the possibility of intermolecular interaction would be increased by a higher local concentration of integrins, we propose that integrin clustering can shift the equilibrium in favor of integrin activation.

Integrins, which are heterodimeric transmembrane proteins composed of α and β subunits, are major receptors for cell adhesion (1Hynes R.O.

The valency of integrin-ligand binding can be increased by integrin clustering. Several reports suggested that there might be a positive correlation between integrin activation and clustering.

However, a study that attempted to identify such a relationship between integrin activation and clustering by inducing αIIb-αIIb clustering through an inducible homodimer system revealed that clustering did not induce integrin activation (9Hato T.

Therefore, it seems to be accepted that there is no correlation between integrin clustering and activation. transmembrane domain C-terminal region of Venus N-terminal region of Venus. Our previous study showed that overexpression of the integrin αIIb TMD-tail or β3 TMD-tail construct can induce activation of integrin αIIbβ3 (12Kim C. Lau T.L. Ulmer T.S. Ginsberg M.H. Interactions of platelet integrin αIIb and β3 transmembrane domains in mammalian cell membranes and their role in integrin activation.Blood. 2009; 113: 4747-4753Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The activation was proven to result from heteromeric interactions of the TMD-tail of each construct with native full-length integrins, thus breaking apart the intramolecular α and β TMD-tail interaction within an integrin. This conclusion led us to hypothesize that when α and β TMD-tails of integrins are separated during integrin activation, each TMD-tail may interact heteromerically with the TMD-tail of other integrins, and this may cause activation as well as clustering of integrins in proximity. Therefore, to test our hypotheses on the relationship between integrin clustering and activation, we sought a way to cluster integrins through α-β heteromeric TMD interaction. One such way to achieve this involved the generation of chimeric integrin constructs. These were then used to show the intermolecular TMD-tail interaction between integrins. By using the chimeric integrin, we also showed that integrin activation can be coupled to integrin clustering. Based on our results, we propose that clustering of integrins not only increases the number of integrins but also shifts the equilibrium to active conformation, providing both increased valency and affinity for enhanced cell adhesive contacts. To construct the chimeric integrin α5-αIIb, we generated the TMD-tail region of the human integrin αIIb subunit by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the forward primer (5′-acaaagcttcagctgctccgggccttg-3′, HindIII cleavage site underlined) and reverse primer (5′-agacttctagatcactccccctcttcatc-3′, XbaI cleavage site underlined). The resulting PCR product was digested with HindIII and XbaI and cloned into pcDNA3.1. Next, the extracellular domain of the human integrin α5 subunit was also amplified by PCR using forward primer (5′-gggtcaagcttatggggagccggacgcca-3′, HindIII cleavage site underlined) and reverse primer (5′-ttgaagctttgtggccacctgacgctc-3′, HindIII cleavage site underlined), and the PCR product was cloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) containing the αIIb TMD-tail. To construct another chimeric integrin β1-β3, the extracellular domain of the human integrin β1 was first generated by PCR using forward primer (gggtcaagcttatgaatttacaaccaatt, HindIII cleavage site underlined) and overlapping reverse primer (5′-ctctggctcttctaccacatgaaccatgacctcgtt-3′, β1 sequence underlined). The TMD-tail region of the human integrin β3 was also generated by PCR using an overlapping forward primer (5′-aacgaggtcatggttcatgtggtagaagagccagag-3′, β3 sequence underlined) and reverse primer (5′-actgctctagattaagtgccccggtacgt-3′, XbaI cleavage site underlined). By using these PCR products as template, the β1-β3 fusion was generated by overlapping PCR and cloned into pcDNA3.1. To construct β1-β3-VN, the β1-β3 fusion and VN were amplified by PCR, and the β1-β3-VN fusion was generated by overlapping PCR as above. The GGGGS linker was introduced between β1-β3 and VN, and the C-terminal end of the cytoplasmic tail of β3 (from 736 to 762) in β1-β3 fusion was excluded to facilitate better VN-VC association. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and A5 cells were maintained as described previously (12Kim C. Lau T.L. Ulmer T.S. Ginsberg M.H. Interactions of platelet integrin αIIb and β3 transmembrane domains in mammalian cell membranes and their role in integrin activation.Blood. 2009; 113: 4747-4753Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The CHO-α-VC cell line was kindly provided by Dr. Sanford Shattil (University of California, San Diego) and maintained as CHO cells. For transient transfection, Lipofectamine and Plus reagents (Invitrogen) were used according to the manufacturer's instructions. An anti-human integrin β1 antibody (MAR4) was purchased from BD Biosciences. An antibody specific to the active form of integrin αIIbβ3, PAC1, has been described previously (10Shattil S.J. Hoxie J.A. Cunningham M. Brass L.F. Changes in the platelet membrane glycoprotein IIb-IIIa complex during platelet activation.J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11107-11114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A5 cells were transfected with the chimeric integrin constructs α5-αIIb and β1-β3. One day after transfection, cell lysates in lysis buffer I (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 mm CaCl2) supplemented with EDTA-free protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science) were clarified by centrifugation and incubated with the anti-human integrin β1 extracellular domain antibody (P5D2) followed by incubation with protein G-Sepharose (GE Healthcare). The resulting precipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting using antiserum against integrin αIIb cytoplasmic tail (Rb9449). An affinity capture assay was performed to measuring α and β TMD interaction as described previously (12Kim C. Lau T.L. Ulmer T.S. Ginsberg M.H. Interactions of platelet integrin αIIb and β3 transmembrane domains in mammalian cell membranes and their role in integrin activation.Blood. 2009; 113: 4747-4753Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Briefly, CHO cells were transfected with αIIb and β3 TMD constructs harboring mutations or not, and lysed with lysis buffer II (20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1% CHAPS, and 2 mm CaCl2) supplemented with EDTA-free protease inhibitor. The lysates were incubated with calmodulin-Sepharose (GE Healthcare), and the bound proteins were analyzed by Western blotting. A PAC1 binding assay was performed as described previously (13Han J. Lim C.J. Watanabe N. Soriani A. Ratnikov B. Calderwood D.A. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Lafuente E.M. Boussiotis V.A. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. Reconstructing and deconstructing agonist-induced activation of integrin αIIbβ3.Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 1796-1806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Briefly, 24 h after transfection of various integrin constructs into A5 or CHO-α-VC cell lines, cells were trypsinized and incubated with PAC1 for 30 min at room temperature. The stained cells were washed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and incubated further with anti-IgM conjugated to phycoerythrin. After washing with DMEM, the resulting cells were analyzed using a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) for PAC1 or MAR4 binding in the FL2 channel and for P5D2 binding or Venus fluorescence in the FL1 channel. Previously, we showed that overexpression of the integrin αIIb TMD-tail construct results in integrin activation by inducing the interaction between the expressed αIIb TMD-tail and β3 TMD-tail region of intact integrins (Fig. 1A). Thus, we hypothesized that the free tail of integrins may also activate neighboring integrins through the same lateral interaction (Fig. 1B). Similarly, we also hypothesized that clustered integrins may have a greater chance to be activated by this intermolecular TMD-tail interaction than nonclustered integrins, due to the increased chance of the lateral interaction in clustered integrins (Fig. 1C). However, as described above, several trials to induce clustering of integrins failed to produce such activation. According to our hypothesis, the integrin clustering resulting from homomeric TMD-tail interactions would not induce separation of α and β TMD-tails and thus would not have any effect on integrin activation (Fig. 1D). Therefore, to clarify the effect of active integrins on the affinity state of neighboring integrins, we designed a chimeric integrin α5-αIIb β1-β3 that can allow heteromeric α-β TMD-tail interactions between integrins. The chimeric integrin contains the extracellular domains of human α5β1 and the TMD-tail regions of human αIIbβ3. Inclusion of the extracellular domains of integrin α5β1 would ensure specific association between the chimeric integrin subunits, and the TMD-tail regions of integrin αIIbβ3 can interact with wild type integrin αIIbβ3, if such a lateral interaction occurs (Fig. 2A).FIGURE 1Hypothetical models of integrin activation through intermolecular interaction. A, overexpression of integrin αIIb TMD-tail construct as a fusion to the Tac (interleukin-2 receptor) extracellular domain induces integrin activation. The expressed αIIb TMD-tail binds to the β3 TMD-tail of full-length integrin and inhibits the intramolecular TMD-tail interaction, thus activating the integrin. B, the TMD-tail region of the αIIb subunit in the activated integrin may bind to and activate neighboring integrins. C, integrin clustering may increase the chance of intermolecular TMD-tail interaction and induce integrin activation. D, integrin clustering by disulfide bond formation between αIIb subunits cannot disrupt intramolecular TMD interaction. Thus, such clustering may not play a role in integrin activation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Following transfection of the chimeric integrin into CHO cells stably expressing integrin αIIbβ3 (A5 cells), an anti-human integrin β1 extracellular domain-specific antibody that binds to the β1-β3 subunit of the chimeric integrin can successfully precipitate α5-αIIb subunit (Fig. 2B), demonstrating that two chimeric integrin subunits can be associated together as expected. Next, we transfected the chimeric integrin α5-αIIb β1-β3 into A5 cells and tested the effect of its expression on integrin αIIbβ3 activation using PAC1, which is a ligand mimetic antibody against integrin αIIbβ3 (10Shattil S.J. Hoxie J.A. Cunningham M. Brass L.F. Changes in the platelet membrane glycoprotein IIb-IIIa complex during platelet activation.J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11107-11114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When the wild type chimeric integrin was expressed, there was a little change in the activation status of integrin αIIbβ3 (Fig. 2C, top panel; Fig. 2D, black circles). However, the activation of integrin αIIbβ3 was significantly increased by expression of a chimeric integrin containing a deletion of cytoplasmic tail (Δ717) and a point mutation (G708I) in β3 (Fig. 2C, middle panel; Fig. 2D, red filled circle). These mutations are known to block αIIb-β3 TMD association; this results in the provision of a free αIIb TMD-tail of the chimeric integrin to a neighboring integrin αIIbβ3 (Fig. 2C, diagram of middle panel). To confirm involvement of the chimeric α5-αIIb integrin TMD-tail in the activation of αIIbβ3, we introduced additional mutations (G972L,G976L) into the chimeric integrin that block α-β TMD-tail association (12Kim C. Lau T.L. Ulmer T.S. Ginsberg M.H. Interactions of platelet integrin αIIb and β3 transmembrane domains in mammalian cell membranes and their role in integrin activation.Blood. 2009; 113: 4747-4753Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2C, bottom panel). As expected, the activating effect of the chimeric integrin is abolished by G972L,G976L mutations (Fig. 2C, bottom panel; Fig. 2D, red empty circle). The effect of chimeric integrins on the affinity state of integrin αIIbβ3 was evident when the expression levels of chimeric integrins were relatively high (Fig. 2, C and D), showing that a high concentration of integrin is required for lateral interaction of integrins. In conclusion, these results suggest that active integrins can activate neighboring integrins by inducing intermolecular heteromeric associations of TMD-tails. Next, we asked whether integrin clustering resulting from an α-β intermolecular TMD-tail interaction among integrins would induce activation of integrins. To visualize and induce the intermolecular heteromeric TMD interaction of integrins, we utilized bimolecular fluorescence complementation using Venus fluorophore (14Shyu Y.J. Liu H. Deng X. Hu C.D. Identification of new fluorescent protein fragments for bimolecular fluorescence complementation analysis under physiological conditions.BioTechniques. 2006; 40: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). For this, we used CHO-α-VC cells that stably express the integrin αIIb subunit fused to the VC as well as integrin β3 subunit as reported previously (15Watanabe N. Bodin L. Pandey M. Krause M. Coughlin S. Boussiotis V.A. Ginsberg M.H. Shattil S.J. Mechanisms and consequences of agonist-induced talin recruitment to platelet integrin αIIbβ3.J. Cell Biol. 2008; 181: 1211-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In addition, we generated a chimeric integrin β1-β3 construct fused to the N-terminal region of Venus (VN) to make β1-β3-VN. The interaction between VN and VC is known to be irreversible; once VN and VC are associated and the fluorescent Venus is assembled, the interaction is stably maintained (16Shyu Y.J. Hu C.D. Fluorescence complementation: an emerging tool for biological research.Trends Biotechnol. 2008; 26: 622-630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). By using VN-VC dimerization to bring TMD-tails close to each other and thus induce TMD-tail lateral interaction, we asked whether lateral TMD-tail interaction can promote integrin activation (Fig. 3A). However, we note that the VN-VC interaction would hold two integrin together at the end of the cytoplasmic tails through a flexible linker, thus it may not force the intermolecular TMD-tail interaction between the clustered integrins directly but rather increases the probability of such lateral interaction by placing two integrins close together. We transfected integrin α5-αIIb and/or β1-β3-VN into CHO-α-VC cells and measured Venus fluorescence and human β1 expression on the cell membrane. As expected, it was possible to observe Venus fluorescence resulting from clustering of those integrins (Fig. 3B). However, transfection of β1-β3-VN alone induced high Venus fluorescence. The Venus fluorescence in this condition looks from the endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi because β1-β3-VN was not exported to the cell surface as determined by surface staining using anti integrin β1 antibody (Fig. 3B, left panel). This intracellular Venus fluorescence is presumably due to nonfunctional complex formation between αIIb-VC and β1-β3-VN mediated by TMD-tail interaction without involvement of head domain interactions. In contrast, when both α5-αIIb and β1-β3-VN constructs were transfected, integrin β1 antibody staining on cell surface was increased (Fig. 3B, middle panel), showing successful and functional assembly of α5-αIIb and β1-β3-VN on the cell surface. These cells also exhibited spontaneous Venus fluorescence resulting from TMD-tail interaction between the chimeric integrin α5-αIIb β1-β3-VN and integrin αIIb-VC β3 (Fig. 3B, middle panel). As a control, we introduced W968C and I693C mutations in α5-αIIb and β1-β3-VN, respectively (Fig. 3C). These mutations are known to block intramolecular TMD-tail separation by producing a spontaneous intersubunit disulfide bond (17Luo B.H. Springer T.A. Takagi J. A specific interface between integrin transmembrane helices and affinity for ligand.PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: e153Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), thus blocking the intermolecular lateral interaction. However, despite blocking intramolecular TMD-tail separation by the disulfide bond, we observed Venus fluorescence from integrin αIIbβ3 and the chimeric integrin (Fig. 3B, right panel). We assume that both integrins fused to VN and VC can be closely localized inside the endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi during biosynthesis. Thus, close proximity during biosynthesis may enable the assembly of the complete Venus protein, presumably due to the intrinsic affinity between VN and VC (16Shyu Y.J. Hu C.D. Fluorescence complementation: an emerging tool for biological research.Trends Biotechnol. 2008; 26: 622-630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), but not due to intermolecular interaction of those integrins. Alternatively, the intermolecular interactions between the chimeric integrin, integrin αIIbβ3, and Venus protein may be established earlier than the disulfide bond formation within the chimeric integrin. In either case, we were able to induce clustering of integrin αIIbβ3 and the chimeric integrin with the “lock” of TMD separation (Fig. 3C). After we confirmed the surface expression of chimeric integrin α5-αIIb β1-β3-VN and its association with integrin αIIb-VC β3 as shown above, we tested the effect of such clustering on integrin affinity state. CHO-α-VC cells transfected with α5-αIIb and/or β1-β3-VN were detached and stained with PAC1 to measure integrin αIIb-VC β3 activation. Venus fluorescence was also measured to determine the amount of clustered integrins in the cells. In CHO-α-VC cells β1-β3-VN expression alone showed Venus fluorescence due to nonfunctional intracellular TMD-tail interaction as discussed above, and there was of course no increase in PAC1 binding on the cell surface (Fig. 3D, black circle; Fig. 3E, left panel). Interestingly, when both α5-αIIb and β1-β3-VN were expressed, PAC1 binding was significantly increased (Fig. 3D, red filled circle; Fig. 3E, middle panel). However, when the separation of TMD-tail regions was blocked by disulfide bonds in α5-αIIb and β1-β3-VN, there was no increase in PAC1 binding (Fig. 3D, red empty circle; Fig. 3E, right panel), showing that Venus-mediated clustering alone does not contribute to integrin activation. Therefore, we conclude that lateral interaction between integrins (or clustering of integrins) via TMD-tail regions can activate integrins, and the separation of TMD-tails is essential for the lateral interaction-induced integrin activation. We also note that increased PAC1 binding in the clustered integrins is not due to the increased valency that results from lateral association of the chimeric integrin and αIIbβ3, but is solely due to the activation of αIIbβ3, because PAC1 cannot recognize the chimeric integrin α5αIIb β1β3. To exclude the possibility that the absence of an activating effect of α5-αIIb(W968C) β1-β3(I693C)-VN in CHO-α-VC cells is due to the inability of β3(I693C) to bind to αIIb, but not due to the inability of intramolecular TMD-tail separation, we tested the effect of the I693C mutation in α-β TMD-tail interaction. The Tac (interleukin-2 receptor)-fused β3 TMD-tail construct (Fig. 4A) bearing the I693C mutation was transfected with the αIIb TMD-tail construct (Fig. 4A), and their association was measured by a pulldown experiment performed as described previously (12Kim C. Lau T.L. Ulmer T.S. Ginsberg M.H. Interactions of platelet integrin αIIb and β3 transmembrane domains in mammalian cell membranes and their role in integrin activation.Blood. 2009; 113: 4747-4753Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4B, the degree of α-β TMD-tail interaction is similar regardless of whether or not the I693C mutation is present. Thus, lack of activation induced by I693C mutation in the β subunit can be attributed to a defect in TMD-tail separation. Here, we demonstrated that there may be a lateral interaction between TMD-tails of two integrins and that the lateral interaction among integrins can induce the activation of αIIbβ3. Based on our previous observation of preferential α-β heterodimeric TMD-tail interaction on CHO cell membrane (12Kim C. Lau T.L. Ulmer T.S. Ginsberg M.H. Interactions of platelet integrin αIIb and β3 transmembrane domains in mammalian cell membranes and their role in integrin activation.Blood. 2009; 113: 4747-4753Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), we favor the interpretation that the activating effect induced by the lateral interaction depends on the heterodimeric TMD-tail interaction between integrins. However, we do not rule out the possibility that homomeric α-α TMD interaction might also contribute to such activating effects, because the G972L,G976L mutations that inhibited the lateral interaction-induced integrin activation in our assay (Fig. 2, C and D) are also known to inhibit the homomeric TMD interaction (7Li W. Metcalf D.G. Gorelik R. Li R. Mitra N. Nanda V. Law P.B. Lear J.D. Degrado W.F. Bennett J.S. A push-pull mechanism for regulating integrin function.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 1424-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Integrins exist in an equilibrium between “αo-βo TMD-tail-bound (inactive)” and “αo and βo TMD-tail-separated (active),” where o indicates original integrin pair. Thus, integrin activation can be viewed as the increased probability of the integrin being in the αo and βo TMD-tail-separated state than in the αo-βo TMD-tail-bound state. We reasoned that the separated αo and βo will have some increased likelihood to interact with another αn or βn (where n indicates neighboring integrin pair) of a neighboring integrin in the TMD-tail separated state, if αn or βn concentration is high in the vicinity of the separated αo or βo. This interaction will prolong the αo and βo TMD-tail-separated (active) state and favor the equilibrium toward activated integrin. Because the heteromeric intermolecular interaction between αo and βn (or βo and αn) is identical to the intramolecular TMD-tail interaction between αo and βo, the heteromeric lateral interaction-induced integrin activation, unlike that induced by homomeric TMD interaction proposed by others (5Li R. Mitra N. Gratkowski H. Vilaire G. Litvinov R. Nagasami C. Weisel J.W. Lear J.D. DeGrado W.F. Bennett J.S. Activation of integrin αIIbβ3 by modulation of transmembrane helix associations.Science. 2003; 300: 795-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), can be only achieved when there are high concentration of integrins (αn and βn) in the active conformation. Accordingly, the activation achieved by Venus-induced lateral integrin interaction alone is modest (Fig. 3, D and E), presumably due to the competition between intermolecular and intramolecular TMD-tail interactions and to the submaximal clustering induced by VN-VC dimerization. However, when lateral interaction is induced by physiological clustering mechanisms, which may induce higher order clustering (18Ye F. Petrich B.G. Anekal P. Lefort C.T. Kasirer-Friede A. Shattil S.J. Ruppert R. Moser M. Fässler R. Ginsberg M.H. The mechanism of kindlin-mediated activation of integrin αIIbβ3.Curr. Biol. 2013; 23: 2288-2295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), and combined with other affinity modulation mechanisms, it may synergize with other mechanisms to dramatically increase integrin activation (9Hato T. Pampori N. Shattil S.J. Complementary roles for receptor clustering and conformational change in the adhesive and signaling functions of integrin αIIbβ3.J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1685-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 18Ye F. Petrich B.G. Anekal P. Lefort C.T. Kasirer-Friede A. Shattil S.J. Ruppert R. Moser M. Fässler R. Ginsberg M.H. The mechanism of kindlin-mediated activation of integrin αIIbβ3.Curr. Biol. 2013; 23: 2288-2295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we speculate that lateral interaction may also contribute to the growth of integrin clusters and integrin adhesion. For example, once an integrin active state is stabilized by binding to ligand, the TMD-tail separation of one integrin would be stabilized (19Luo B.H. Carman C.V. Springer T.A. Structural basis of integrin regulation and signaling.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 25: 619-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1245) Google Scholar). Thus, the intermolecular interaction of integrins can be used for a “zipper-like” cell attachment; ligand binding of one integrin recruits another integrin by lateral interaction, and the interaction activates the integrin, thus forming the second adhesion site. Talin is known to bind integrin β tails (20Tadokoro S. Shattil S.J. Eto K. Tai V. Liddington R.C. de Pereda J.M. Ginsberg M.H. Calderwood D.A. Talin binding to integrin β tails: a final common step in integrin activation.Science. 2003; 302: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar), induce a change in the tilt angle of β TMD (21Kim C. Ye F. Hu X. Ginsberg M.H. Talin activates integrins by altering the topology of the β transmembrane domain.J. Cell Biol. 2012; 197: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) that can separate α-β TMD-tails (22Kim C. Schmidt T. Cho E.G. Ye F. Ulmer T.S. Ginsberg M.H. Basic amino-acid side chains regulate transmembrane integrin signalling.Nature. 2012; 481: 209-213Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and activate integrins. Because the lateral interaction between integrins is predicted to involve the same α-β binding interface, talin would not only inhibit intramolecular α-β TMD interactions, but also the intermolecular α-β TMD interaction. Therefore, we suggest that lateral interaction-induced integrin activation may be useful for transient cell-substrate interaction where rapid turnover of integrin activity is needed, whereas talin-induced integrin activation may be responsible for more stable cell adhesion. In conclusion, we suggest here that intermolecular interaction between integrins through heteromeric TMD-tail interactions can activate integrins and that integrin clustering can facilitate the intermolecular interaction by increasing local concentration of integrins. Thus, integrin clustering may be closely related to integrin activation. We thank Dr. Mark Ginsberg and Dr. Naohide Watanabe for kind feedback on this study."

From the initial findings of discontinuous polymorphism through the debates regarding the evolution of mimicry and the step-size of evolutionary change, to the studies on supergene evolution and molecular characterisation of butterfly genomes, mimetic butterflies have been at the heart of evolutionary thought for over 100 years. During this time, few species have received as much attention and in-depth study as Papilio dardanus. To assist all aspects of mimicry research, we present a complete data-derived overview of the extent of polymorphism within this species. Using historical samples permanently held by the NHM London, we document the extent of phenotypic variation and characterise the diversity present in each of the subspecies and how it varies across Africa. We also demonstrate an association between “imperfect” mimetic forms and the transitional race formed in the area where Eastern and Western African populations meet around Lake Victoria. We present a novel portal for access to this collection, www.mimeticbutterflies.org, allowing remote access to this unique repository. It is hoped that this online resource can act as a nucleus for the sharing and dissemination of other collections databases and imagery connected with mimetic butterflies."

Another typical trait of apoptotic cell death is the extensive hydrolysis of nuclear DNA into oligonucleosome-sized fragments. These are highly distinctive events (hallmarks) of apoptosis, and no other types of cell death provoke such cellular alterations (1Lecoeur H. Nuclear apoptosis detection by flow cytometry: influence of endogenous endonucleases.Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 277: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The nuclei of cells committed to apoptosis undergo different ultrastructural stepwise modifications. In the first stage, chromatin condenses around the nuclear membrane, known as stage I chromatin condensation or stage I nuclear morphology (2Susin S.A. Daugas E. Ravagnan L. Samejima K. Zamzami N. Loeffler M. Costantini P. Ferri K.F. Irinopoulou T. Prévost M.C. Brothers G. Mak T.W. Penninger J. Earnshaw W.C. Kroemer G. Two distinct pathways leading to nuclear apoptosis.J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Later nuclear changes include shrinkage and fragmentation of the nucleus into highly packed round masses of condensed chromatin (3Wyllie A.H. Morris R.G. Smith A.L. Dunlop D.

Condensed matter in cell death.Nature. 1999; 401: 127-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), also known as stage II chromatin condensation (2Susin S.A. Daugas E. Ravagnan L. Samejima K.

Med. 2000; 192: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). In parallel, the genomic content is extensively fragmented in a two-step process, in which the DNA is first cleaved into 50–300-kilobase pair (kbp) fragments, an event also known as high molecular weight (HMW) 6The abbreviations used are:HMWhigh molecular weightCADcaspase-activated DNaseDEVDAsp-Glu-Val-Asp DFF40/CAD, DNA fragmentation factor, 40-kDa subunitDFF45DNA fragmentation factor, 45-kDa subunitICADinhibitor of CADLDHlactate dehydrogenaseLMWlow molecular weightMTT3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromideqVDQ-VD-OPh, N-(2-quinolyl)valyl-aspartyl-(2,6-difluorophenoxy)methyl ketoneSTPstaurosporineTRAILTNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand. DNA degradation, followed by hydrolysis into smaller fragments of oligonucleosomal size, also called “DNA ladder” (5Liu X. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X.

Sikorska M. New aspects of the mechanism of DNA fragmentation in apoptosis.Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 75: 287-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The molecular machinery involved in the apoptotic hallmarks is a family of cysteine proteases called caspases. Caspases can be broadly classified into “initiator” (caspase-2, -8, -9, and -10) or “effector” caspases (caspase-3, -6, and -7) (7Riedl S.J. Shi Y. Molecular mechanisms of caspase regulation during apoptosis.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 897-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (1571) Google Scholar). After direct activation by initiator caspases, effector caspases execute limited proteolysis of downstream specific substrates, triggering a cascade of events that will dismantle the cell (8Pop C. Salvesen G.S. Human caspases: activation, specificity, and regulation.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 21777-21781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). The inhibition of caspases in damaged cells avoids cell death as well as apoptotic hallmarks (9Elmore S. Apoptosis: a review of programmed cell death.Toxicol. Pathol. 2007; 35: 495-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (8614) Google Scholar, 10Yuste V.J. Sánchez-López I. Solé C. Moubarak R.S. Bayascas J.R. Dolcet X. Encinas M. Susin S.A. Comella J.X.

Telford W. Skommer J. Darzynkiewicz Z. Apoptosis and beyond: cytometry in studies of programmed cell death.Methods Cell Biol. 2011; 103: 55-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). The main protein triggering the two hallmarks of apoptotic cell death downstream of the activation of caspases is a nuclease called DNA fragmentation factor 40-kDa subunit (DFF40) (12Liu X. Li P. Widlak P. Zou H. Luo X. Garrard W.T. Wang X. The 40-kDa subunit of DNA fragmentation factor induces DNA fragmentation and chromatin condensation during apoptosis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

A caspase-activated DNase that degrades DNA during apoptosis, and its inhibitor ICAD.Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2805) Google Scholar) in mice. DFF40/CAD remains inactive when combined with its chaperone-inhibitor, ICAD (15Sakahira H. Enari M. Nagata S. Cleavage of CAD inhibitor in CAD activation and DNA degradation during apoptosis.Nature. 1998; 391: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1422) Google Scholar), also known as DNA fragmentation factor, 45-kDa subunit (DFF45) (5Liu X.

DFF, a heterodimeric protein that functions downstream of caspase-3 to trigger DNA fragmentation during apoptosis.Cell. 1997; 89: 175-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1647) Google Scholar). After apoptotic insult, active caspase-3 processes ICAD into two aspartic residues, Asp-117 and Asp-224, in both long (DFF45/ICADL) and short (DFF35/ICADS) splicing variants (5Liu X. Zou H.

The hydrolysis of DFF45/ICADL in these two residues allows the release and activation of DFF40/CAD (12Liu X. Li P. Widlak P. Zou H. Luo X. Garrard W.T. Wang X.

The DNA laddering appears after DFF40/CAD-mediated DNA hydrolysis at internucleosomal sites (12Liu X. Li P. Widlak P. Zou H. Luo X. Garrard W.T. Wang X.

Many approaches have been used to unravel the molecular mechanisms implicated in the onset and progression of apoptotic nuclear morphology and DNA degradation during apoptosis. Classically, stage II chromatin condensation and oligonucleosomal DNA degradation were considered concomitant events (16Steller H.

DFF40/CAD activity still remains as the key biochemical feature triggering both apoptotic nuclear changes and DNA laddering. Yet, some cellular models, in which stage II nuclear morphology occurs in the absence of DNA laddering, have recently pointed out that these two apoptotic hallmarks can be dissociated (20Oberhammer F.

Moreover, no cellular models have so far been reported showing the presence of DNA ladder in the absence of nuclear disassembly following caspase-dependent apoptotic cell death. high molecular weight caspase-activated DNase Asp-Glu-Val-Asp DFF40/CAD, DNA fragmentation factor, 40-kDa subunit DNA fragmentation factor, 45-kDa subunit inhibitor of CAD lactate dehydrogenase low molecular weight 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide Q-VD-OPh, N-(2-quinolyl)valyl-aspartyl-(2,6-difluorophenoxy)methyl ketone staurosporine TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand. In this study, we report on a glioblastoma multiforme-derived human cell line, LN-18 cells, in which apoptotic stimuli induce caspase-dependent cell death, characterized by a single mass of highly compacted chromatin without displaying either oligonucleosomal DNA degradation or stage II nuclear morphology. The poor expression of DFF40/CAD endonuclease seems to be the reason why LN-18 cells cannot generate DNA laddering after apoptotic stimuli, as the overexpression of the nuclease is sufficient to make these cells fully competent to degrade DNA into oligonucleosome-sized fragments. Interestingly, we show that higher levels of DFF40/CAD failed to induce stage II apoptotic nuclear morphology after caspase-dependent cytotoxic insult. Moreover, by using cell-free assays, we demonstrate that LN-18 isolated nuclei cannot display apoptotic nuclear alterations. Altogether, our results show, for the first time, that DFF40/CAD is necessary and sufficient to generate DNA laddering, but not sufficient to provoke nuclear disassembly during apoptosis, and other players seem to be needed. All chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise indicated. The pan-caspase inhibitor q-VD-OPh was from MP Biomedicals Europe (Illkirch, France). Antibodies against caspase-3 (9662; 1:2,000) and caspase-7 (9492; 1:2,000) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA).

IMR-5, LN-18, and SH-SY5Y cells were routinely grown in 100-mm culture dishes (BD Falcon, Madrid, Spain) containing 10 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin (100 units/ml and 100 μg/ml, respectively) and 10% of heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Invitrogen). Medium was routinely changed every 3 days. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a saturating humidity atmosphere containing 95% air and 5% CO2. Nuclear morphology staining with Hoechst 33258 and trypan blue assays were performed as established previously in our laboratory (24Gozzelino R. Sole C. Llecha N. Segura M.F. Moubarak R.S.

Cell nuclei were visualized with a Nikon ECLIPSE TE2000-E microscope equipped with epifluorescence optics under UV illumination and a Hamamatsu ORCA-ER photographic camera. Stained nuclei were scored as stage I (partial chromatin condensation in the absence of karyorrhexis), stage II (nuclear pyknosis and karyorrhexis), or stage III (nuclei shrinkage and highly compacted chromatin) morphology (10Yuste V.J.

The result is a colored water-insoluble formazan salt. This technique was performed as described previously (18Boix J. Llecha N. Yuste V.J. Comella J.X.

The measure of extracellular LDH was performed by a modified protocol from Decker and Lohmann-Matthes (25Decker T. Lohmann-Matthes M.L. A quick and simple method for the quantitation of lactate dehydrogenase release in measurements of cellular cytotoxicity and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) activity.J. Immunol. Methods. 1988; 115: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded in a 96-multiwell plate at 50% confluence the day before treatment. Then, medium was replaced by 50 μl of fresh medium containing or not 1 μm STP. 24 h later, 20 μl of lactate solution (14.38 mg/ml in 10 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.5) was added, followed by 20 μl of INT solution (0.9 mg/ml INT in PBS prepared from a 20 mg/ml stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide). The enzymatic reaction was started by addition of 20 μl of a PBS solution containing NAD+ (1.65 mg/ml), diaphorase (7·10−7 units/ml), BSA (0.015%), and sucrose (0.6%) and allowed to proceed for 20 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 20 μl of the LDH inhibitor oxamate (5.6 mg/ml in PBS). Absorbance was measured by using a 490 nm filter in a BIO-TEK FL800 fluorometer (Izasa, Spain). The percentage of LDH activity in the culture medium was calculated taking into account the LDH activity obtained from non-treated cells permeabilized with a solution containing 1% Triton X-100, assumed as 100% of LDH activity. LMW analysis was carried out as described previously (26Ribas J. Yuste V.J. Garrofé-Ochoa X. Meijer L. Esquerda J.E.

Extracted DNA was analyzed in 1.8% agarose gel in 1 mm EDTA, 40 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.6, stained in 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide, and then visualized using a Syngene Gene Genius UV transilluminator equipped with a photographic camera. Detection of HMW fragments was made as described previously (23Iglesias-Guimarais V. Gil-Guiñon E. Gabernet G. García-Belinchon M. Sánchez-Osuna M. Casanelles E. Comella J.X. Yuste V.J.

Chem. 2012; 287: 7766-7779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The gel was electrophoresed at room temperature for 16 h at 45 V. Following electrophoresis, the gel was stained in 2 μg/ml ethidium bromide for 2 h and washed twice with distilled water for 30 min. DNA was visualized using a Syngene Gene Genius UV transilluminator coupled with a photographic camera. Transmission electron microscopy was used to examine the nuclear morphology of IMR-5, SH-SY5Y, and LN-18 cells as well as LN-18 cells transfected with pcDNA3.1 containing or not the open reading frame of the human CAD. Stably transfected cells were left untreated or treated with staurosporine for 10 h. Cells were then collected and fixed with 2.5% (v/v) glutaraldehyde and 2% (v/v) paraformaldehyde (EM grade, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) in phosphate buffer (100 mm, pH 7.4). After fixation, pellets were rinsed four times with phosphate buffer and postfixed in 1% (w/v) osmium tetroxide (TAAB Laboratories, Berkshire, UK) containing 0.8% (w/v) potassium hexacyanoferrate (III) (Sigma) for 2 h. After four washes with deionized water, pellets were sequentially dehydrated in acetone. All of these steps were performed at 4 °C. Samples were then embedded in Eponate 12TM resin (Ted Pella Inc., Redding, CA) and polymerized for 48 h at 60 °C. Ultrathin (70 nm thick) sections were placed on noncoated copper grids (200 meshes), contrasted with uranyl acetate and lead citrate solutions, and visualized with a transmission electron microscope (Jeol JEM-1400) equipped with a CCD GATAN ES1000W Erlangshen camera. Quantitative DEVD-like activities in cell lysates were performed as described previously (27Yuste V.J. Bayascas J.R. Llecha N. Sánchez-López I. Boix J. Comella J.X.

Chem. 2001; 276: 22323-22331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The resulting 96-multiwell microplates were incubated for 10 h at 35 °C. The data were obtained by using a BIO-TEK Synergy HT fluorometer, under an excitation filter of 360 nm (40-nm bandwidth) and an emission filter of 530 nm (25-nm bandwidth). Cells were detached, pelleted at 600 × g for 5 min, and washed once with PBS. Then cells were lysed 15 min on ice with Igepal buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Igepal CA-630, 1× protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma)) for cytosolic protein extracts. The pellets were clarified by centrifuging at 16,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Alternatively, cells were lysed with SET buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% SDS) and heated at 95 °C for 10 min to obtain total protein extracts. The protein concentration in the supernatants was quantified by a modified Lowry assay (DC protein assay; Bio-Rad), and 20–35 μg of protein was loaded in SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were electrophoresed and electrotransferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore) or Protran nitrocellulose transfer membrane (Whatman). After blocking with Tris-buffered saline (TBS), 0.1% Tween 20 containing 5% nonfat dry milk, the membranes were probed with the appropriate specific primary antibodies and incubated with the adequate secondary antibodies conjugated with peroxidase. Finally, immunoblots were developed by EZ-ECL chemiluminescence detection kit (Biological Industries, Kibbutz Beit-Haemek, Israel). When the specific antibodies were blotted, the membranes were stained for 5 min in a solution containing 10% methanol, 2% acetic acid, and 0.1% naphthol blue. Then, membranes were destained in a 10% methanol and 2% acetic acid solution for 10 min. Membranes were allowed to dry and were scanned. mRNA was isolated from untreated LN-18 cells using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions, employing for the extraction the RLN buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 140 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Igepal CA-630, 1,000 units/ml RNase inhibitor, 1 mm DTT). Two micrograms of RNA was reverse-transcribed (Transcriptor First Strand cDNA Synthesis kit; Roche Applied Science) using 10 pmol of random hexamer primer or the specific downstream primer (CAD-R; see below) for 30 min at 65 °C. Two microliters of cDNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction in an Applied Biosystem thermal cycler 2720 with 300 nm for each primer. The polymerase chain reaction conditions were 95 °C for 20 s, 56 °C for 10 s, and 70 °C for 24 s, repeated 30 cycles in 1.5 mm MgSO4, 200 nm each dNTP, and 1 unit of KOD Hot Start DNA polymerase (Merck). For amplifying DFF40/CAD the following primers were used: CAD-F, 5′-CAGAGGGCTTGAGGACAT-3′ and CAD-R, 5′-TCAGGCCTCAAACAAAGACCAGGA-3′. The 1,017-base pair amplified cDNA was automatically sequenced in both directions in a 3130XL genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems) corresponding to the whole ORF of human DFF40/CAD (GenBankTM accession number NM_004402). For amplifying DFF45/ICADL the following primers were used: EcoRI-ICAD-F, 5′-GGAATTCGGTCCCACCTTGTGGAGGAT-3′ and EcoRI-ICAD-R, 5′-GGAATTCGAGGCTGAGGGTGTCTACCA-3′. The 996-base pair cDNA obtained, corresponding to the whole ORF of human DFF45/ICADL (GenBankTM accession number NM_004401), was also sequenced in both directions. Finally, for amplifying DFF35/ICADS the following primers were used: EcoRI-ICAD-F, 5′-TGAATTCCACCTCTGCATGATACTACTACATCC-3′ and EcoRI-ICADS-R 5′-CCGCTCGAGCAGGGCATGTCCTCCTCTGTAG-3′. The 807-base pair cDNA obtained, corresponding to the whole ORF of human DFF35/ICADS (GenBankTM accession number NM_213566), was also sequenced in both directions. Cytoplasms and nuclei from LN-18 and SH-SY5Y cells were prepared as established previously in our laboratory (23Iglesias-Guimarais V. Gil-Guiñon E. Gabernet G. García-Belinchon M. Sánchez-Osuna M.

Each reaction was carried out employing 150 μg of cytosolic extract and 105 nuclei and stopped by adding 5 mm EDTA after 2 h. Then, reactions were centrifuged for 15 min at 16,000 × g, at 4 °C. Supernatants were collected and DNA extracted to discard the LMW DNA fragments as potential contaminant from staurosporine-pretreated SH-SY5Y cytoplasms. The pelleted nuclei were washed once with cytosolic extraction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm EGTA, 2.5% glycerol, 0.5% Igepal CA-630) obtaining the “nuclei wash” fraction that was also DNA-extracted to further ascertain both the absence of DNA after nuclei wash and the purity of the pelleted nuclei. Finally, pelleted nuclei were resuspended in bi-distilled water and processed according to the oligonuc"
https://openalex.org/W2074308857,"Neurons innervating peripheral tissues display complex responses to peripheral nerve injury. These include the activation and suppression of a variety of signalling pathways that together influence regenerative growth and result in more or less successful functional recovery. However, these responses can be offset by pathological consequences including neuropathic pain. Calcium signalling plays a major role in the different steps occurring after nerve damage. As part of our studies to unravel the roles of injury-induced molecular changes in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons during their regeneration, we show that the calcium calmodulin kinase CaMK1a is markedly induced in mouse DRG neurons in several models of mechanical peripheral nerve injury, but not by inflammation. Intrathecal injection of NRTN or GDNF significantly prevents the post-traumatic induction of CaMK1a suggesting that interruption of target derived factors might be a starter signal in this de novo induction. Inhibition of CaMK signalling in injured DRG neurons by pharmacological means or treatment with CaMK1a siRNA resulted in decreased velocity of neurite growth in vitro. Altogether, the results suggest that CaMK1a induction is part of the intrinsic regenerative response of DRG neurons to peripheral nerve injury, and is thus a potential target for therapeutic intervention to improve peripheral nerve regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2028289268,"A number of factors have been identified that are related to sexual and injecting HIV transmission. We developed a probabilistic mathematical model to put these factors together and interpret risks in the context of individual behavior among injecting drug-using (IDU) couples in St. Petersburg, Russia. Some HIV-discordant couples have unprotected sex and sometimes inject drugs together but stay discordant for a long time, while some individuals acquire HIV on the first encounter. We considered existing estimates of HIV transmission risks through injecting and sexual contacts to develop a predictive survival model for an individual who is exposed to HIV through intimate relationships. We computed simulated survival curves for a number of behavioral scenarios and discussed sources of simulated uncertainty. We then applied the model to a longitudinal study of HIV-discordant couples and validated the model's forecast. Although individual prediction of seroconversion time appeared impossible, the ability to rank behavioral patterns in terms of HIV risk and to estimate the probability of survival HIV-free will be important to educators and counselors."
https://openalex.org/W2026809798,"In lizards, one of the most important behavioral mechanisms to cope with spatial and temporal variations in thermal resources observed is activity time. The longer a lizard can maintain activity, the more time it has to forage and reach larger adult body size. We studied the behavioral adjustments to different climatic regimens on daily and seasonal scales in three natural populations of the lizard Microlophus atacamensis along a latitudinal temperature and rainfall gradient. We also used Niche Mapper to determinate the amount of thermally suitable time for activity for this species. Abundance and daily activity patterns varied greatly over the year for the three populations. In summer and spring, the daily activity times were greater, and were reduced in fall and winter seasons. In summer, when stressful heat loads should prohibit activity over a midday gap, lizards did not show bimodal patterns of activity. Instead, they move to the cooler intertidal habitat. Abundance and thermal quality in the southernmost coolest site was lower, and the potential annual activity time decreases with latitude. Contrary to expectations, lizards from this locality showed the largest body sizes possibly due to diet and/or time to sexual maturation. Our results indicate that the intertidal habitat is a key factor that influences daily and seasonal activity of M. atacamensis lizards. While this habitat is not climatically optimal for lizards, it allows them to behaviorally extend their activity window and gain access to food in the intertidal areas."
https://openalex.org/W2072739427,"To elucidate further from the biomechanical aspect whether microgravity-induced cerebral vascular mal-adaptation might be a contributing factor to postflight orthostatic intolerance and the underlying mechanism accounting for the potential effectiveness of intermittent artificial gravity (IAG) in preventing this adverse effect.Middle cerebral arteries (MCAs) were isolated from 28-day SUS (tail-suspended, head-down tilt rats to simulate microgravity effect), S+D (SUS plus 1-h/d -Gx gravitation by normal standing to simulate IAG), and CON (control) rats. Vascular myogenic reactivity and circumferential stress-strain and axial force-pressure relationships and overall stiffness were examined using pressure arteriography and calculated. Acellular matrix components were quantified by electron microscopy. The results demonstrate that myogenic reactivity is susceptible to previous pressure-induced, serial constrictions. During the first-run of pressure increments, active MCAs from SUS rats can strongly stiffen their wall and maintain the vessels at very low strains, which can be prevented by the simulated IAG countermeasure. The strains are 0.03 and 0.14 respectively for SUS and S+D, while circumferential stress being kept at 0.5 (106 dyn/cm2). During the second-run pressure steps, both the myogenic reactivity and active stiffness of the three groups declined. The distensibility of passive MCAs from S+D is significantly higher than CON and SUS, which may help to attenuate the vasodilatation impairment at low levels of pressure. Collagen and elastin percentages were increased and decreased, respectively, in MCAs from SUS and S+D as compared with CON; however, elastin was higher in S+D than SUS rats.Susceptibility to previous myogenic constrictions seems to be a self-limiting protective mechanism in cerebral small resistance arteries to prevent undue cerebral vasoconstriction during orthostasis at 1-G environment. Alleviating of active stiffening and increasing of distensibility of cerebral resistance arteries may underlie the countermeasure effectiveness of IAG."
