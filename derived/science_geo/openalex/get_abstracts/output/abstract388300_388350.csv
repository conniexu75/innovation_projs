The occurrence of sphacelial and sclerotial stages of a Claviceps on this host was first recorded by Ajrekar1 in the course of his studies on the sugary disease of jowar in India caused by Sphacelia Sorghi McRae. In their studies on the ergot in South India, Thomas et al.2 have given measurements of the spores of the Sphacelia and of the sclerotia. The honey dew forms a brownish viscid crust on the infected spikelets, embedding numerous spores. The spores are hyaline, thin-walled, 17–24 × 3–7 µ."

It has been shown that sedimentation is hastened if, in consequence of physiopathological occurrences in the organism, the protein fractions of high molecular weight (fibrinogen, globulins) have increased1."

https://openalex.org/W2969566380,"ONE of the remarkable features of the successful use of D.D.T.-impregnated clothing against the louse is the prolonged insecticidal effect of the clothing after several launderings, which would appear to indicate a strong absorption of the compound on the textile fibres. It occurred to us that animal hair might behave in the same way, and that useful results might be obtained in veterinary practice by the simple expedient of incorporating D.D.T. in soap1."
